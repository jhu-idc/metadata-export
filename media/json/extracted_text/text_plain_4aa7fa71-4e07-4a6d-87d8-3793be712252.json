The plant depends<br />\non oil tanks with only a 30,000<br />\ngallon capacity.<br />\n\"If we are faced to bum oil<br />\ndue to an interruption in service,<br />\n30,000 gallons of oil will sustain<br />\nour winter heating needs for just<br />\nover two days,\" said Campbell.<br />\nInclement weather and bad road<br />\nconditions, could hamper<br />\ndeliveries of oil through the<br />\nwinter months and conceivably<br />\nthreatened the plant's ability to<br />\nserve the campus, he added.<br />\nCampbell recommended an<br />\nincrease in the capacity of<br />\nholding tanks for oil at the<br />\nHopkins power plant in the event<br />\nof more frequent interrupted<br />\nservice which is predicted by<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore Gas and Electric.<br />\nSeven years ago, the power<br />\nplant was converted from a<br />\ncoal-burning unit to its present<br />\nform, primarily burning natural<br />\ngas and using oil as an emergency<br />\nbackup fuel. Coal was abandoned<br />\nbecause of short supply and the<br />\nproblems encountered with<br />\npollution. Campbell discounted<br />\nthe possibility of converting from<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nnatural gas the least expensive<br />\nsystem, to either electrical or<br />\nnuclear means of operating the<br />\nplant, mainly because of the cost<br />\nfactors<br />\nBesides central heating<br />\nfunctions, the campus power<br />\nplant is also responsible for air<br />\nconditioning during summer<br />\nmonths and electrical<br />\ndistribution throughout the year.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4/news-letter/september 28, 1973<br />\n<br />\nNew biology building site recommended<br />\nBIO.

They've<br />\nnever had an easy time of it in their location on<br />\nCanterbury road, an area populated mostly by elderly<br />\npeople, but this year, the problem seems to be worse than<br />\nusual. Complaints of loud parties, rude students and<br />\nrampant vandalism have come up before, but never as<br />\nintensely and as bitterly as now.<br />\nNeighborhood residents appear ready to take action,<br />\nsomething they might have done long ago. For far too long,<br />\nfraternities have been throwing noisy parties, disturbing<br />\ntheir neighbors and disrupting the community of which<br />\nthey are a part. While many students who are not members<br />\nof either house take neither very seriously and dismiss both<br />\nas \"jock frats,\" the fact remains that both of these houses<br />\nare doing serious damage to the reputations of students in<br />\ngeneral and themselves in particular. Since Hopkins has<br />\nlittle power over the situation, its major weapon being a<br />\nthreat to withdraw recognition, only the fraternities<br />\nthemselves \u2014 perhaps forced by a legal decision \u2014 can act<br />\nto improve the situation. Last year, Hopkins withdrew<br />\nUniversity recognition after Gam threw a particularly<br />\ndisruptive party, but that did not keep Gam members from<br />\nlater receiving property thay knew, by their own admission,<br />\nto be stolen.<br />\nBut the withdrawal of recognition is little more than a<br />\nformality anyway, since Hopkins does not own the houses<br />\nand has no right to tell students they cannot live in them.<br />\nThe only solution, short of a bitter legal controversy, is for<br />\nmembers of these fraternities to realize that their neighbors<br />\nhave their own lives to live, and may not wish to live them<br />\nthe same way the brothers do.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nnuclear power<br />\nThe possibility of the campus power plant, Whitehead Hall,<br />\nconverting its energy source from natural gas to nuclear fuel was<br />\nrecently discounted by University officials as too expensive. It<br />\nseems, in making such a hasty decision, that the administration<br />\nhas failed to recognize several other important considerations<br />\ninvolved in \"going nuclear.\"<br />\nFirst of all, aside from the obvious comfort and security such<br />\na conversion would offer D-Level throats, keeping them warm<br />\nand sleepy on those cold wintry nights just before finals, a<br />\nnuclear reactor at Hopkins would provide just the right<br />\nacademic status boon so sorely needed to see the Hopkins<br />\nHundreds campaign to a profitable ending. Should our<br />\nreasoning on this point escape you, consider how often one<br />\nhears Stanford, U.C.L.A., or M.I.T., powerhouses in<br />\nmoney-grubbing as well as nuclear research, complain of empty<br />\npockets.<br />\nIn addition to the financial rewards of gaining nuclear status,<br />\n101<br />\n<br />\n_\u2022<br />\n<br />\n*VC\\<br />\n<br />\n1\\Ae.rcxcivkak\"<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nee.c,xe<br />\n<br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\nThis summer the 19 members of<br />\nthe Baltimore City Council passed<br />\nby one vote a controversial<br />\nresolution supporting the<br />\nconstruction of a new sports<br />\ncomplex in the predominantly<br />\nwhite city neighborhood of<br />\nWaverly. Strong protests from<br />\nconstituent groups in the Second<br />\nCouncilmanic District (which<br />\nincludes Waverly) and the general<br />\nopposition from Council liberals<br />\nplaced heavy pressure on all three<br />\nSecond District Councilmen<br />\n(Robert Fitzpatrick, Robert<br />\nDouglas and Clarance \"Du\" Burns)<br />\nto oppose the measure. Fitzpatrick<br />\ncast the deciding \"aye.\"<br />\nWhat was unusual about<br />\nFitzpatrick's decision to split with<br />\nhis discontented constituents and<br />\nthe other liberal Councilmen<br />\nopposing the measure was the<br />\napparent influence of Mayor<br />\nWilliam Donald Schaefer. At the<br />\nMayor's request, Fitzpatrick visited<br />\nthe Mayor's Office on the<br />\nafternoon of the vote.<br />\n\"He used what I thought was a<br />\npersuasive arguement,\" said<br />\nFitzpatrick. Schaefer's pitch was<br />\nthis: \"If the Council voted against<br />\nthe resolution, the whole thing was<br />\ndead right there; if we voted for it,<br />\nit was only a resolution, not a<br />\nlegislative mandate, and it would<br />\nbe throughly heard in Annapolis<br />\nand could be voted up or down at<br />\nthat time.\"<br />\nFor Fitzpatrick, who usually<br />\nopposes the Schaefer<br />\nAdministration on most<br />\ncontroversial issues and hardly ever<br />\nignores strong constituency<br />\nappeals, the sports complex vote<br />\nwas a marked departure from what<br />\nhe likes to call his \"knee jerked<br />\nliberalism.\"<br />\n\"Since coming on the council,<br />\nI've received an incredible<br />\neducation. If I had to describe<br />\nmyself four years ago, I would<br />\nhave said I was a knee-jerked<br />\nliberal...if there was a war, I<br />\nopposed it, if there was peace I<br />\ncelebrated it, and I was on the<br />\nproper side in political<br />\ncampaigns--the losing ones--from<br />\nGene McCarthy to Joe Tydings.\"<br />\n\"Today, I'm not a cavalier<br />\n1 VC<br />\n<br />\nieaueu<br />\n<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\nUV:A....Utile<br />\n<br />\nIF \u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nsuch a conversion, scientists at the Applied Physics Laboratory<br />\nin Howard County, should, also be considered in this, a decision<br />\nof nuclear proportions. For the same technology which enabled<br />\nAPL to devise its miniature pacemaker this summer, could<br />\nconceivably give rise to all sorts of new devices, such as<br />\natomic-powered Buicks for the University Vice Presidents, or<br />\nmaybe even a dependable hot-water system for the Homewood<br />\nApartments.<br />\n<br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\nOne appreciation<br />\ndrive he organized and carried out<br />\nhimself.

I am writing it<br />\non behalf of quite a few people in<br />\nthe Baltimore area. It is for the<br />\nvictims of last year's flood for<br />\nwhom he found temporary shelter<br />\nand whose homes he helped<br />\nrestore. It is for the elderly people<br />\nwho because of his efforts, were<br />\nable to celebrate Christmas and<br />\nHanukah with suitable holiday<br />\nmeals.

It is for the sick and<br />\naged who bene fitted from the food<br />\n<br />\nRobert J. Fitzpatrick<br />\n<br />\nin formation<br />\nwas accurately reported. As a<br />\nprofessional reporter and editor<br />\nmyself, I know full well how hard<br />\nit is to get a good telephone<br />\ninterview. His speed in getting it<br />\nwas fantastic! In this time when<br />\nthe press across the board seems in<br />\nsuch ill repute with the reading<br />\npublic, more reporters like Mr.<br />\nSolow and more papers like the<br />\nNews Letter are a definite<br />\nnecessity.<br />\nMy only complaint is, as a<br />\nnon-JHU alumnus, that I don't see<br />\nenough copies of the paper. Can I<br />\nsubscribe?<br />\nnuance of background<br />\n<br />\nBlaine Taylor<br />\n<br />\npositions simply because it may be<br />\nthe popular and liberal thing to<br />\ndo...One of the great temptations<br />\nof liberals is to identify and speak<br />\nout on every problem from Hunger<br />\nin Biafra to problems in Asia, war,<br />\nto be on the instant side of God<br />\nand Justice on every issue.<br />\n\"I've become much less<br />\nconcerned about being on the<br />\ninstant side of God and Justice and<br />\nmuch more concerned with solving<br />\nsome of the practical, less<br />\nglamorous day-to-day problems<br />\nthat do determine the quality of<br />\nlife for people in a community.\"<br />\nOf all 19 members of the City<br />\nCouncil, three from each of six<br />\ndistricts plus Council President<br />\nWally Orlinsky, Fitzpatrick may<br />\nwell be perceived as the most<br />\nliberal by traditional definition of<br />\nthe label. Along with Council<br />\nwoman Barbara Mikulski, now<br />\nchairperson of the Democratic<br />\nNational Committee's Commission<br />\non Delegate Selection, Fitzpatrick<br />\nsees himself as one Council<br />\nmember most willing to take<br />\npolitical risks, to vote on an<br />\nunpopular issue, to take the heat.\"<br />\nBut being liberal no longer<br />\ncarries the sense of urgency it did<br />\nto Fitzpatrick when he pressed for<br />\ncivil rights legislation in the South,<br />\nwhen he spent \"almost all\" of his<br />\ntime upon returning to Baltimore<br />\n\"dealing with problems and issues<br />\nthat affected the black<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\n\"Since being on the Council (he<br />\n<br />\nPOLITICIANS UNITE-Robert J. Fitzpatrick and Student Council head Andrew Savitz.<br />\nwas elected in 1971 as a member<br />\nof a black and white coalition<br />\nticket in the second district) I've<br />\nlearned an incredible amount<br />\nabout the so-called white working<br />\nclass communities, like Waverly,<br />\nHampden, Remington, and<br />\nWoodbury. And I learned more<br />\nthan just facts. I've developed an<br />\nextremely high respect for the<br />\npeople in those communities for<br />\nwhat they've done to preserve, to<br />\nbuild, to keep together a<br />\ncommunity in spite of some very<br />\nstrong odds.<br />\n\"These communities are rich<br />\nenough so that they didn't qualify<br />\nfor any of the federal<br />\nprograms--be it rat eradication,<br />\nhousing code enforcement, urban<br />\nrenewal ---but not wealthy enough<br />\n<br />\ncommunity, and to facing up to<br />\nsome of the specific and general<br />\nproblems that community has.<br />\nBlacks form 70 percent of my<br />\ndistrict, and if I didn't represent<br />\nthem as well, I wouldn't be doing<br />\nthe job.\"<br />\nNot so ironically, Fitzpatrick's<br />\nattitude toward the Mayor has<br />\nshifted to admiration and respect<br />\ntoo. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being<br />\nstrong disapproval and 10 being<br />\nstrong approval, Fitzpatrick said he<br />\nwould give the Mayor a 10 for his<br />\noverall performance in office to<br />\ndate.<br />\n\"The Mayor may be less fun,<br />\nstylish, or charismatic than a John<br />\nLindsay or a Tommy D'Alesandro.<br />\nThere are a number of decisions of<br />\nhis I would fault, and a number of<br />\nthings I think are lacking.<br />\n<br />\nto respond. He knows how to get it<br />\nby the heart and squeeze until it<br />\ndoes respond.\"<br />\nFor example, Fitzpatrick<br />\nobserved, the Department of<br />\nTransit and Traffic (\"the most<br />\nnotoriously unresponsive of the<br />\ncity's departments\") recently<br />\nrefused to put up a stop sign in<br />\nBolton Hill where two children<br />\nhave recently been hit by cars.<br />\nDT&T claimed the corner \"does<br />\nnot qualify statistically for a<br />\nsufficient volume of traffic to<br />\nwarrant a traffic control device,\"<br />\nnotwithstanding the fact that one<br />\nvictim's father had already<br />\ncomplained about the situation<br />\nbefore the injuries occurred, as had<br />\nFitzpatrick himself.<br />\n<br />\nthat expressways, and sports<br />\nhousing problems\u2014they're<br />\ncomplexs are more important than<br />\nconstantly caught in a bind.\"<br />\nthey really are. I think he<br />\nOne of the touchiest issues<br />\nsometimes lacks imagination in<br />\namong \"liberals\" and<br />\nvisualizing solutions to some of the<br />\n\"conservatives\" in any city is the<br />\ncity's problems.

The<br />\nOctoberfest of baseball, played<br />\nbefore shivering crowds in<br />\nlook-alike stadiums, comes as a<br />\nfitting close to one of the most<br />\nbizarre seasons in recent history.<br />\nAfter an on-again, off-again<br />\n<br />\nstrike during spring training that<br />\nseriously eroded fan support for<br />\nthe fat-cat players, the campaign<br />\ngot underway with a topsy-turvy<br />\nlook. League leaders included<br />\nPhiladelphia, Montreal,<br />\nMilwaukee and the White Sox,<br />\nwhile Baltimore fumbled around<br />\nin fifth place and St. Louis<br />\nplayed at an astonishing .200<br />\nclip. Fergie Jenkins proved he<br />\nwas more than a 20-win machine<br />\nby winning very few, demanding<br />\nto be traded, and hurling bats to<br />\novercome his vexations.

At this<br />\nwriting, five clubs, all deserving<br />\nfor a variety of reasons, remain in<br />\ncontention for the four spots.<br />\nThree have already clinched: In<br />\nthe AL East, the Orioles; in the<br />\nAL West, the Oakland A's, and in<br />\nthe NL West, the Oncinnati Reds.<br />\nEarl Weaver's concession to<br />\nthe youth movement this season<br />\nmay well have initiated another<br />\nstring of pennants for Baltimore.<br />\nBenching Mery Rettenmund and<br />\nPaul Blair was not a popular<br />\nmove with the veteran-dominated squad, but replacements Al<br />\nBumbry and Rich Coggins have<br />\nrevived a lagging Bird attack,<br />\nproviding all the support their<br />\nexcellent pitching staff needs.<br />\nThe Orioles display an altogether<br />\ndifferent approach to the game<br />\nthan in the past, relying on hits<br />\nand stolen bases rather than the<br />\n<br />\nlong ball, but one can't quarrel<br />\nwith the results.<br />\nBaltimore's opponent, the<br />\nOakland A's, have quietly<br />\ntrounced all opposition again this<br />\nyear while capturing their third<br />\nstraight flag.

To bring<br />\neveryone up to date, the A's are<br />\ntremendous once again.

In a best-three-of-five<br />\nseries, such teams rarely win. The<br />\nMets, on the other hand, present<br />\na trio of pitchers in Tom Seaver,<br />\nJon Matlack and Jerry Koosman<br />\nthat can beat almost anyone,<br />\nproviding they can get some bat<br />\nsupport.

Loyola, ranked<br />\nthird in the college division of<br />\nthe NCAA, handed Hopkins a 3-0<br />\nshutout defeat in an exhausting,<br />\nquick-paced game. The Blue Jays<br />\nwere coming off a 6-0 league<br />\nvictory against Haverford<br />\nCollege.<br />\nUnlike last week's torrid<br />\noffensive drive against Have rford,<br />\nwhich saw the Hopkins' booters<br />\nput 35 shots on goal, the<br />\nBluejays were stifled on offense<br />\nand managed only 10 goal-bound<br />\nshots. A hard pressing Loyola<br />\nattack combined accurate passing<br />\nand ball control to force Hopkins<br />\ninto a defensive game most of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nLoyola opened the scoring<br />\nquickly, putting a tally on the<br />\nboard within the first 15 seconds.<br />\nLoyola, taking the opening<br />\nkick-off moved the ball upfield<br />\nwhere Mel Majchrzak took<br />\ncontrol. Majchrzak then passed<br />\nquickly to wing man Jack<br />\nQuaranta. As Quaranta moved in<br />\non the goal from the right side.<br />\nHopkins' goalie Keith Naumheim<br />\ncame out in an attempt to cut,<br />\noff Quaranta's angle. But<br />\nQuaranta tipped the ball off his<br />\nchest, cut to Naumheim's inside<br />\n<br />\nand booted a weak shot into the<br />\nnet.<br />\nWith the score 1-0, Loyola<br />\ncontinued to pressure the<br />\nHopkins' defensive unit. Nearly<br />\nall the first half action occurred<br />\nin the Bluejay's territory. With<br />\nthis on going Loyola drive,<br />\nHopkins made sparkling<br />\ndefensive plays. Goalie<br />\nNaumheim and defensive back<br />\nJoe Rutkowski thwarted a<br />\nscoring attack by Loyola lineman .<br />\nLes Chelminiak as they both<br />\ncame out to cut off Chelminiak,<br />\nwho was moving for the goal<br />\nmouth, and kicked the ball safely<br />\nout of bounds.<br />\nIn the last three minutes of the<br />\nfirst half, Hopkins turned the<br />\ntables somewhat and began<br />\nmoving on Loyola's goal. Phil<br />\nHieter missed an excellent<br />\nscoring opportunity when the<br />\nLoyola goalie was out of position<br />\nas he kicked an off target shot<br />\nwide of the net.<br />\nAt halftime, with the score<br />\n1-0, Coach Robert Oliver noted<br />\nsome Hopkins weaknesses. The<br />\nBluejays defensemen would<br />\ncrowd around the ball instead of<br />\nmoving into position up-field .<br />\nCoach Oliver wanted his line to<br />\nstay up-field in position to<br />\nmount a quick offense and move<br />\nthe ball forward.<br />\nThe second half began as had<br />\n<br />\nthe first. Loyola's line man Ian<br />\nReid took a pass in Hopkins<br />\nterritory and dribbled through<br />\nthe Bluejay defensive backs and<br />\nbooted in an unassisted goal at<br />\n4:15<br />\nHopkins mounted more of an<br />\noffensive drive in the second half.<br />\nRoberto Arguero, Hopkins'<br />\nleading scorer last year, barely<br />\nmissed the goal on a quick<br />\nHopkins break. The Bluejays<br />\nmissed many scoring<br />\nopportunities due to the failure<br />\nof not moving the ball quick<br />\nenough downfield. Play killing<br />\noffsides and a hands call busted<br />\nthe Hopkins' offensive threats.<br />\nSecond Half<br />\nLoyola pressed Hopkins in the<br />\nsecond half but the defense was<br />\nonly to allow another unassisted<br />\nscore by right winger Les<br />\nChelminiak to close the scoring<br />\nat 3-0. Defensive back Lou<br />\nPodrazik for the Bluejays was<br />\ninstrumental in .stopping a<br />\npossible fourth goal by Loyola<br />\nwhen he made a sliding tackle to<br />\nknock the ball away from a<br />\nbreaking Mel Majchrzak..<br />\nThe Bluejays will regroup and<br />\nprepare for tomorrow's<br />\nMason-Dixon Conference game<br />\nagainst Towson State.

Barnes estimated that<br />\ndemolition of the Lane building, now on<br />\nthat site, would probably begin this<br />\nwinter.<br />\n\"Beyond the grants, the only thing<br />\nwe have is about S4-million that we've<br />\n<br />\nbeen accumulating in the building fund<br />\nfor the past half-dozen years,\" Barnes<br />\nwent on.<br />\nThe Hundreds campaign, a:<br />\nannounced last February 22 by Dr.<br />\nSteven Muller, president of both<br />\ninstitution, includes plans to raise<br />\n$20-million in cash, and later,<br />\nS80-million in loans, to rebuild much of<br />\nthe East Baltimore facility, which first<br />\nopened in 1889.<br />\nThough the Hospital has reportedly<br />\nbeen pledged over $6-million toward its<br />\ncash goal. Barnes remarked, \"Obviously,<br />\nwe can't pay our bills today with<br />\npledges.<br />\n\"So.\" he said, \"we're working on the<br />\nassumption that a lot of this money is<br />\nnot going to be available right away, and<br />\nwe know that we can't count on that<br />\n[the pledges] to pay the bills at this<br />\npoint in time.\"<br />\nThe famous green -corned<br />\nadministration building with the<br />\nmammoth statue of Jesus, separated<br />\nfrom the Broadway entrance's by a<br />\nlandscaped green, will not be<br />\ndemolished.<br />\nBut patients will enter the Hospital<br />\nfrom the east, through a walkway over<br />\nWolf Street.<br />\nThe 4-story cancer center, to cost<br />\nabout S12-million in all, should be ready<br />\nto open sometime in 1976.<br />\nOver $14-million is slated for the<br />\npatient care structure, to be built in the<br />\nHospital's courtyard and adjacent to<br />\nHalstead, the surgery center.<br />\nIn addition, planned renovations in<br />\nHalstead, and Osler, the medicine<br />\nbuilding, should cost about $4-million.<br />\nIn addition to the Woman's Clinic,<br />\nthe Marburg building, for private<br />\npatients, is slated to be closed. Marburg,<br />\nalong with the domed building and the<br />\nWilmer Institute, will become national<br />\nlandmarks soon, if Hopkins proposals to<br />\nthe federal government are<br />\naccepted. The $38-million budgeted<br />\nfor the first phase of the redevelopment<br />\nalso includes about $2-million for added<br />\ngenerating capacity at the power plan,<br />\nand over S300,000 for parking. Site<br />\npreparation, including demolition, will<br />\ncost nearly S1.2-million, while<br />\nS4.8-million will be set aside for fees<br />\nand contingencies.<br />\nThe S100-million program, which May<br />\n<br />\nrun for 15 years, includes plans for<br />\nanother large patient care structure, next<br />\nto Osler.<br />\nThe first of the large patient care<br />\nbuilding, in addition to its beds, will<br />\nhouse the overflow from the Radiology<br />\nbuilding, and will replace the turn of the<br />\ncentury woman's clinic, on the Wolfe<br />\nStreet side of the Hospital. It will<br />\ninclude three delivery suites, six labor<br />\nrooms, and three gynecological operating<br />\nrooms.<br />\nClassrooms, conference rooms, and<br />\nother meeting areas are planned for the<br />\nareas shared bys the cancer center and<br />\nthe 180-bed building.<br />\nWhen Step 1 is completed in three<br />\nyears or so, the total number of hospital<br />\nbeds will be reduced from the present<br />\n1,065 to approximately 940. This<br />\nreduction should, Hospital officials say,<br />\nhike the total occupancy rate from the<br />\npresent sluggish 70 percent to about 85<br />\npercent.<br />\nThe plan is to encourage<br />\nHopkins-affiliated doctors to refer their<br />\npatients to the Hopkins Hospital, and<br />\nnot to more modern facilities in the<br />\nCounty.<br />\nAll the construction announced in the<br />\nStep 1 project is to take place in the<br />\nfour-block area circumscribed by the<br />\nparking lot adjacent to Broadway,<br />\n<br />\nMonument, Wolfe and Orleans Streets,<br />\nthe present site of the Hospital.<br />\nFollowing a period of expansion into<br />\nthe mostly poor and black neighborhod<br />\nin the early and mid-sixties, new<br />\nbuilding virtually ceased. The only<br />\nexception was the four-story Park<br />\nbuilding, for children's outpatient<br />\nservices, which opened in 1971.<br />\nDuring this period, Hospital<br />\nadministrators considered moving the<br />\nMedical Institutions out of the inner<br />\ncity, and to a more suburban location.<br />\nAround 1971, however, they decided to<br />\nkeep the Hospital in EAst Baltimore.<br />\nand promised community leaders that<br />\nthere would be no further expansion to<br />\nthe north or west.<br />\nBuilt in the sixties were the new basic<br />\nscience building, the Traylor research<br />\nbuilding, Turner Auditorium, and the<br />\nChildren's Medical and Surgical Center.<br />\nMore recently, the Hospital has<br />\nconsiderably expanded its health care<br />\ndelivery services, with8 clinics in the<br />\nplanned Howard County city, Columbia,<br />\nand in East Baltimore.<br />\nThe East Baltimore Medical Program,<br />\nbegun in late 1971, has several thousand<br />\npersons registered.<br />\nThe Program provides medical, dental,<br />\nand other health-related services for<br />\npre-payed members.<br />\n<br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br />\nPEKING GARDEN<br />\nChinese Restaurant<br />\n2410 E.

The plant depends<br />\non oil tanks with only a 30,000<br />\ngallon capacity.<br />\n\"If we are faced to bum oil<br />\ndue to an interruption in service,<br />\n30,000 gallons of oil will sustain<br />\nour winter heating needs for just<br />\nover two days,\" said Campbell.<br />\nInclement weather and bad road<br />\nconditions, could hamper<br />\ndeliveries of oil through the<br />\nwinter months and conceivably<br />\nthreatened the plant's ability to<br />\nserve the campus, he added.<br />\nCampbell recommended an<br />\nincrease in the capacity of<br />\nholding tanks for oil at the<br />\nHopkins power plant in the event<br />\nof more frequent interrupted<br />\nservice which is predicted by<br /><br />\nBaltimore Gas and Electric.<br />\nSeven years ago, the power<br />\nplant was converted from a<br />\ncoal-burning unit to its present<br />\nform, primarily burning natural<br />\ngas and using oil as an emergency<br />\nbackup fuel. Coal was abandoned<br />\nbecause of short supply and the<br />\nproblems encountered with<br />\npollution. Campbell discounted<br />\nthe possibility of converting from<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nnatural gas the least expensive<br />\nsystem, to either electrical or<br />\nnuclear means of operating the<br />\nplant, mainly because of the cost<br />\nfactors<br />\nBesides central heating<br />\nfunctions, the campus power<br />\nplant is also responsible for air<br />\nconditioning during summer<br />\nmonths and electrical<br />\ndistribution throughout the year.<br /><br />\npage 4/news-letter/september 28, 1973<br /><br />\nNew biology building site recommended<br />\nBIO.

They've<br />\nnever had an easy time of it in their location on<br />\nCanterbury road, an area populated mostly by elderly<br />\npeople, but this year, the problem seems to be worse than<br />\nusual. Complaints of loud parties, rude students and<br />\nrampant vandalism have come up before, but never as<br />\nintensely and as bitterly as now.<br />\nNeighborhood residents appear ready to take action,<br />\nsomething they might have done long ago. For far too long,<br />\nfraternities have been throwing noisy parties, disturbing<br />\ntheir neighbors and disrupting the community of which<br />\nthey are a part. While many students who are not members<br />\nof either house take neither very seriously and dismiss both<br />\nas \"jock frats,\" the fact remains that both of these houses<br />\nare doing serious damage to the reputations of students in<br />\ngeneral and themselves in particular. Since Hopkins has<br />\nlittle power over the situation, its major weapon being a<br />\nthreat to withdraw recognition, only the fraternities<br />\nthemselves \u2014 perhaps forced by a legal decision \u2014 can act<br />\nto improve the situation. Last year, Hopkins withdrew<br />\nUniversity recognition after Gam threw a particularly<br />\ndisruptive party, but that did not keep Gam members from<br />\nlater receiving property thay knew, by their own admission,<br />\nto be stolen.<br />\nBut the withdrawal of recognition is little more than a<br />\nformality anyway, since Hopkins does not own the houses<br />\nand has no right to tell students they cannot live in them.<br />\nThe only solution, short of a bitter legal controversy, is for<br />\nmembers of these fraternities to realize that their neighbors<br />\nhave their own lives to live, and may not wish to live them<br />\nthe same way the brothers do.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nnuclear power<br />\nThe possibility of the campus power plant, Whitehead Hall,<br />\nconverting its energy source from natural gas to nuclear fuel was<br />\nrecently discounted by University officials as too expensive. It<br />\nseems, in making such a hasty decision, that the administration<br />\nhas failed to recognize several other important considerations<br />\ninvolved in \"going nuclear.\"<br />\nFirst of all, aside from the obvious comfort and security such<br />\na conversion would offer D-Level throats, keeping them warm<br />\nand sleepy on those cold wintry nights just before finals, a<br />\nnuclear reactor at Hopkins would provide just the right<br />\nacademic status boon so sorely needed to see the Hopkins<br />\nHundreds campaign to a profitable ending. Should our<br />\nreasoning on this point escape you, consider how often one<br />\nhears Stanford, U.C.L.A., or M.I.T., powerhouses in<br />\nmoney-grubbing as well as nuclear research, complain of empty<br />\npockets.<br />\nIn addition to the financial rewards of gaining nuclear status,<br />\n101<br /><br />\n_\u2022<br /><br />\n*VC\\<br /><br />\n1\\Ae.rcxcivkak\"<br />\na<br /><br />\nee.c,xe<br /><br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\nThis summer the 19 members of<br />\nthe Baltimore City Council passed<br />\nby one vote a controversial<br />\nresolution supporting the<br />\nconstruction of a new sports<br />\ncomplex in the predominantly<br />\nwhite city neighborhood of<br />\nWaverly. Strong protests from<br />\nconstituent groups in the Second<br />\nCouncilmanic District (which<br />\nincludes Waverly) and the general<br />\nopposition from Council liberals<br />\nplaced heavy pressure on all three<br />\nSecond District Councilmen<br />\n(Robert Fitzpatrick, Robert<br />\nDouglas and Clarance \"Du\" Burns)<br />\nto oppose the measure. Fitzpatrick<br />\ncast the deciding \"aye.\"<br />\nWhat was unusual about<br />\nFitzpatrick's decision to split with<br />\nhis discontented constituents and<br />\nthe other liberal Councilmen<br />\nopposing the measure was the<br />\napparent influence of Mayor<br />\nWilliam Donald Schaefer. At the<br />\nMayor's request, Fitzpatrick visited<br />\nthe Mayor's Office on the<br />\nafternoon of the vote.<br />\n\"He used what I thought was a<br />\npersuasive arguement,\" said<br />\nFitzpatrick. Schaefer's pitch was<br />\nthis: \"If the Council voted against<br />\nthe resolution, the whole thing was<br />\ndead right there; if we voted for it,<br />\nit was only a resolution, not a<br />\nlegislative mandate, and it would<br />\nbe throughly heard in Annapolis<br />\nand could be voted up or down at<br />\nthat time.\"<br />\nFor Fitzpatrick, who usually<br />\nopposes the Schaefer<br />\nAdministration on most<br />\ncontroversial issues and hardly ever<br />\nignores strong constituency<br />\nappeals, the sports complex vote<br />\nwas a marked departure from what<br />\nhe likes to call his \"knee jerked<br />\nliberalism.\"<br />\n\"Since coming on the council,<br />\nI've received an incredible<br />\neducation. If I had to describe<br />\nmyself four years ago, I would<br />\nhave said I was a knee-jerked<br />\nliberal...if there was a war, I<br />\nopposed it, if there was peace I<br />\ncelebrated it, and I was on the<br />\nproper side in political<br />\ncampaigns--the losing ones--from<br />\nGene McCarthy to Joe Tydings.\"<br />\n\"Today, I'm not a cavalier<br />\n1 VC<br /><br />\nieaueu<br /><br />\nto<br /><br />\nUV:A....Utile<br /><br />\nIF \u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nsuch a conversion, scientists at the Applied Physics Laboratory<br />\nin Howard County, should, also be considered in this, a decision<br />\nof nuclear proportions. For the same technology which enabled<br />\nAPL to devise its miniature pacemaker this summer, could<br />\nconceivably give rise to all sorts of new devices, such as<br />\natomic-powered Buicks for the University Vice Presidents, or<br />\nmaybe even a dependable hot-water system for the Homewood<br />\nApartments.<br /><br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\nOne appreciation<br />\ndrive he organized and carried out<br />\nhimself. It is for all of those people<br />\nwho have been touched by his<br />\ngenuine kindness, and comforted<br />\nby his sense of humor.<br />\nMost of all I am writing this<br />\nbecause of Mr. Burke's habit of<br />\nconveniently disappearing<br />\nwhenever anyone suggests that he<br />\nshould be thanked or repaid for<br />\nhis work. It is a chance to publicly<br />\nexpose him, and to make Hopkins<br />\naware of how well they have been<br />\nrepresented in the local<br />\ncommunities.<br />\nSo this is a letter of thanks, not<br />\nfor a compulsive do-gooder, but<br />\nfor a personable and mature<br />\nperson, capable of giving of<br />\nhimself.<br />\nMrs. Janet Prince<br /><br />\n... and another<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThis is to thank you for the<br />\nexcellent article which appeared in<br />\nyour publication recently<br />\nconcerning the Mayor's Advisory<br />\nCommittee on Municipal Problems<br />\nand Solutions, of which I am<br />\nchairman.<br />\nHopefully, the article will<br />\ninspire Hopkins students to<br />\nvolunteer their ideas, talents, and<br />\nlabor to the committee to make<br />\nBaltimore a better city for<br />\neveryone.<br />\nI especially want to commend<br />\nyour reporter, Ronald S.

I am writing one that is<br />\nvery different. It is simply an open<br />\nletter of thanks to a Hopkins<br />\nsenior, Ray Burke. I am writing it<br />\non behalf of quite a few people in<br />\nthe Baltimore area. It is for the<br />\nvictims of last year's flood for<br />\nwhom he found temporary shelter<br />\nand whose homes he helped<br />\nrestore. It is for the elderly people<br />\nwho because of his efforts, were<br />\nable to celebrate Christmas and<br />\nHanukah with suitable holiday<br />\nmeals. It is for the gifted children<br />\nof one school and the retarded<br />\nchildren in another to whom he<br />\ngave his time. It is for the sick and<br />\naged who bene fitted from the food<br /><br />\nRobert J. Fitzpatrick<br /><br />\nin formation<br />\nwas accurately reported. As a<br />\nprofessional reporter and editor<br />\nmyself, I know full well how hard<br />\nit is to get a good telephone<br />\ninterview. His speed in getting it<br />\nwas fantastic! In this time when<br />\nthe press across the board seems in<br />\nsuch ill repute with the reading<br />\npublic, more reporters like Mr.<br />\nSolow and more papers like the<br />\nNews Letter are a definite<br />\nnecessity.<br />\nMy only complaint is, as a<br />\nnon-JHU alumnus, that I don't see<br />\nenough copies of the paper. Can I<br />\nsubscribe?<br />\nnuance of background<br /><br />\nBlaine Taylor<br /><br />\npositions simply because it may be<br />\nthe popular and liberal thing to<br />\ndo...One of the great temptations<br />\nof liberals is to identify and speak<br />\nout on every problem from Hunger<br />\nin Biafra to problems in Asia, war,<br />\nto be on the instant side of God<br />\nand Justice on every issue.<br />\n\"I've become much less<br />\nconcerned about being on the<br />\ninstant side of God and Justice and<br />\nmuch more concerned with solving<br />\nsome of the practical, less<br />\nglamorous day-to-day problems<br />\nthat do determine the quality of<br />\nlife for people in a community.\"<br />\nOf all 19 members of the City<br />\nCouncil, three from each of six<br />\ndistricts plus Council President<br />\nWally Orlinsky, Fitzpatrick may<br />\nwell be perceived as the most<br />\nliberal by traditional definition of<br />\nthe label. Along with Council<br />\nwoman Barbara Mikulski, now<br />\nchairperson of the Democratic<br />\nNational Committee's Commission<br />\non Delegate Selection, Fitzpatrick<br />\nsees himself as one Council<br />\nmember most willing to take<br />\npolitical risks, to vote on an<br />\nunpopular issue, to take the heat.\"<br />\nBut being liberal no longer<br />\ncarries the sense of urgency it did<br />\nto Fitzpatrick when he pressed for<br />\ncivil rights legislation in the South,<br />\nwhen he spent \"almost all\" of his<br />\ntime upon returning to Baltimore<br />\n\"dealing with problems and issues<br />\nthat affected the black<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\n\"Since being on the Council (he<br /><br />\nPOLITICIANS UNITE-Robert J. Fitzpatrick and Student Council head Andrew Savitz.<br />\nwas elected in 1971 as a member<br />\nof a black and white coalition<br />\nticket in the second district) I've<br />\nlearned an incredible amount<br />\nabout the so-called white working<br />\nclass communities, like Waverly,<br />\nHampden, Remington, and<br />\nWoodbury. And I learned more<br />\nthan just facts. I've developed an<br />\nextremely high respect for the<br />\npeople in those communities for<br />\nwhat they've done to preserve, to<br />\nbuild, to keep together a<br />\ncommunity in spite of some very<br />\nstrong odds.<br />\n\"These communities are rich<br />\nenough so that they didn't qualify<br />\nfor any of the federal<br />\nprograms--be it rat eradication,<br />\nhousing code enforcement, urban<br />\nrenewal ---but not wealthy enough<br /><br />\ncommunity, and to facing up to<br />\nsome of the specific and general<br />\nproblems that community has.<br />\nBlacks form 70 percent of my<br />\ndistrict, and if I didn't represent<br />\nthem as well, I wouldn't be doing<br />\nthe job.\"<br />\nNot so ironically, Fitzpatrick's<br />\nattitude toward the Mayor has<br />\nshifted to admiration and respect<br />\ntoo. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being<br />\nstrong disapproval and 10 being<br />\nstrong approval, Fitzpatrick said he<br />\nwould give the Mayor a 10 for his<br />\noverall performance in office to<br />\ndate.<br />\n\"The Mayor may be less fun,<br />\nstylish, or charismatic than a John<br />\nLindsay or a Tommy D'Alesandro.<br />\nThere are a number of decisions of<br />\nhis I would fault, and a number of<br />\nthings I think are lacking.<br /><br />\nto respond. He knows how to get it<br />\nby the heart and squeeze until it<br />\ndoes respond.\"<br />\nFor example, Fitzpatrick<br />\nobserved, the Department of<br />\nTransit and Traffic (\"the most<br />\nnotoriously unresponsive of the<br />\ncity's departments\") recently<br />\nrefused to put up a stop sign in<br />\nBolton Hill where two children<br />\nhave recently been hit by cars.<br />\nDT&amp;T claimed the corner \"does<br />\nnot qualify statistically for a<br />\nsufficient volume of traffic to<br />\nwarrant a traffic control device,\"<br />\nnotwithstanding the fact that one<br />\nvictim's father had already<br />\ncomplained about the situation<br />\nbefore the injuries occurred, as had<br />\nFitzpatrick himself.<br /><br />\nthat expressways, and sports<br />\nhousing problems\u2014they're<br />\ncomplexs are more important than<br />\nconstantly caught in a bind.\"<br />\nthey really are. I think he<br />\nOne of the touchiest issues<br />\nsometimes lacks imagination in<br />\namong \"liberals\" and<br />\nvisualizing solutions to some of the<br />\n\"conservatives\" in any city is the<br />\ncity's problems. Baltimore will be<br />\npolice force. \"Most liberals have<br />\nthe last city in the United States to<br />\nbeen terribly critical--particularly<br />\nbuild an expressway through the<br />\nin the late sixties---of police<br />\ncity.<br />\ndepartments,\" Fizpatrick asserted.<br />\n\"At the same time, however,<br />\n\"I spent some time riding in<br />\nwhat the Mayor has done better<br />\npatrol cars. walking beats with<br />\nthan anybody I've ever met in any<br />\npolicemen, and did the same thing<br />\nbureaucracy is understand how<br />\nwith firemen. Coming to know<br />\nbureaucracies work and get them<br />\nthem, not just on the PolicP<br />\nCommissioner's level or even the<br />\npolice captain's level but also the<br />\nseargents and patrolmen in a<br />\ndistrict, I began to discover some<br />\nof the immense pressures and<br />\nA recent early-morning visit to<br />\nproblems they're faced with.\"<br />\nquaint Washington College, an<br />\n\"I saw a man who's best friend<br />\n800-student coeducational<br />\nhad just been shot and killed, who<br />\ninstitution in even quainter<br />\nhad not fired first although the<br />\nChestertown, across the bay,<br />\nopportunity to do so was there.

To bring<br />\neveryone up to date, the A's are<br />\ntremendous once again.

Loyola, ranked<br />\nthird in the college division of<br />\nthe NCAA, handed Hopkins a 3-0<br />\nshutout defeat in an exhausting,<br />\nquick-paced game. The Blue Jays<br />\nwere coming off a 6-0 league<br />\nvictory against Haverford<br />\nCollege.<br />\nUnlike last week's torrid<br />\noffensive drive against Have rford,<br />\nwhich saw the Hopkins' booters<br />\nput 35 shots on goal, the<br />\nBluejays were stifled on offense<br />\nand managed only 10 goal-bound<br />\nshots. A hard pressing Loyola<br />\nattack combined accurate passing<br />\nand ball control to force Hopkins<br />\ninto a defensive game most of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nLoyola opened the scoring<br />\nquickly, putting a tally on the<br />\nboard within the first 15 seconds.<br />\nLoyola, taking the opening<br />\nkick-off moved the ball upfield<br />\nwhere Mel Majchrzak took<br />\ncontrol. Majchrzak then passed<br />\nquickly to wing man Jack<br />\nQuaranta. As Quaranta moved in<br />\non the goal from the right side.<br />\nHopkins' goalie Keith Naumheim<br />\ncame out in an attempt to cut,<br />\noff Quaranta's angle. But<br />\nQuaranta tipped the ball off his<br />\nchest, cut to Naumheim's inside<br /><br />\nand booted a weak shot into the<br />\nnet.<br />\nWith the score 1-0, Loyola<br />\ncontinued to pressure the<br />\nHopkins' defensive unit. Nearly<br />\nall the first half action occurred<br />\nin the Bluejay's territory. With<br />\nthis on going Loyola drive,<br />\nHopkins made sparkling<br />\ndefensive plays. Goalie<br />\nNaumheim and defensive back<br />\nJoe Rutkowski thwarted a<br />\nscoring attack by Loyola lineman .<br />\nLes Chelminiak as they both<br />\ncame out to cut off Chelminiak,<br />\nwho was moving for the goal<br />\nmouth, and kicked the ball safely<br />\nout of bounds.<br />\nIn the last three minutes of the<br />\nfirst half, Hopkins turned the<br />\ntables somewhat and began<br />\nmoving on Loyola's goal. Phil<br />\nHieter missed an excellent<br />\nscoring opportunity when the<br />\nLoyola goalie was out of position<br />\nas he kicked an off target shot<br />\nwide of the net.<br />\nAt halftime, with the score<br />\n1-0, Coach Robert Oliver noted<br />\nsome Hopkins weaknesses. The<br />\nBluejays defensemen would<br />\ncrowd around the ball instead of<br />\nmoving into position up-field .<br />\nCoach Oliver wanted his line to<br />\nstay up-field in position to<br />\nmount a quick offense and move<br />\nthe ball forward.<br />\nThe second half began as had<br /><br />\nthe first. Loyola's line man Ian<br />\nReid took a pass in Hopkins<br />\nterritory and dribbled through<br />\nthe Bluejay defensive backs and<br />\nbooted in an unassisted goal at<br />\n4:15<br />\nHopkins mounted more of an<br />\noffensive drive in the second half.<br />\nRoberto Arguero, Hopkins'<br />\nleading scorer last year, barely<br />\nmissed the goal on a quick<br />\nHopkins break. The Bluejays<br />\nmissed many scoring<br />\nopportunities due to the failure<br />\nof not moving the ball quick<br />\nenough downfield. Play killing<br />\noffsides and a hands call busted<br />\nthe Hopkins' offensive threats.<br />\nSecond Half<br />\nLoyola pressed Hopkins in the<br />\nsecond half but the defense was<br />\nonly to allow another unassisted<br />\nscore by right winger Les<br />\nChelminiak to close the scoring<br />\nat 3-0. Defensive back Lou<br />\nPodrazik for the Bluejays was<br />\ninstrumental in .stopping a<br />\npossible fourth goal by Loyola<br />\nwhen he made a sliding tackle to<br />\nknock the ball away from a<br />\nbreaking Mel Majchrzak..<br />\nThe Bluejays will regroup and<br />\nprepare for tomorrow's<br />\nMason-Dixon Conference game<br />\nagainst Towson State.

This will be particularly<br />\nharmful to the defense, which<br />\nneeds to work as a unit<br />\nproficiently.<br />\n\"I expect a real high scoring<br />\nexciting game,\" added Coach<br />\nCowan with this in mind.

COHEN<br />\nFinancing has not yet been arranged<br />\nfor the $38-million development program<br />\nslated to begin next year at the Hopkins<br />\nHospital, W. Thomas Barnes,<br />\nSecretary-Treasurer of the Hospital<br />\nremarked.<br />\nThe first phase of the $120-million<br />\nHospital program, part of the joint<br />\nUniversity-Hospital Hopkins Hundreds<br />\ncampaign, will include construction of an<br />\neight-story, 180-bed patient care building.<br />\nand a sixty-bed cancer center.<br />\n\"We really don't have any financing<br />\nplan arranged yet,\" Barnes said in an<br />\ninterview last night.<br />\n\"The only financing we know we have<br />\nis a $6.5-million federal grant for<br />\noncology (cancer research). and a<br />\n$2-million grant from the state, for the<br />\nsame center.\" he explained.<br /><br />\nW. Thomas Barnes<br />\nIn addition, parking facilities will be<br />\nexpanded, and several structures,<br />\nincluding the Harriet Lane building and<br />\nthe old Main Residence Building, will be<br />\ntorn down.<br />\nGroundbreaking for the cancer center,<br />\nfirst announced last spring, is targeted<br />\nfor June, 1974. Barnes estimated that<br />\ndemolition of the Lane building, now on<br />\nthat site, would probably begin this<br />\nwinter.<br />\n\"Beyond the grants, the only thing<br />\nwe have is about S4-million that we've<br /><br />\nbeen accumulating in the building fund<br />\nfor the past half-dozen years,\" Barnes<br />\nwent on.<br />\nThe Hundreds campaign, a:<br />\nannounced last February 22 by Dr.<br />\nSteven Muller, president of both<br />\ninstitution, includes plans to raise<br />\n$20-million in cash, and later,<br />\nS80-million in loans, to rebuild much of<br />\nthe East Baltimore facility, which first<br />\nopened in 1889.<br />\nThough the Hospital has reportedly<br />\nbeen pledged over $6-million toward its<br />\ncash goal. Barnes remarked, \"Obviously,<br />\nwe can't pay our bills today with<br />\npledges.<br />\n\"So.\" he said, \"we're working on the<br />\nassumption that a lot of this money is<br />\nnot going to be available right away, and<br />\nwe know that we can't count on that<br />\n[the pledges] to pay the bills at this<br />\npoint in time.\"<br />\nThe famous green -corned<br />\nadministration building with the<br />\nmammoth statue of Jesus, separated<br />\nfrom the Broadway entrance's by a<br />\nlandscaped green, will not be<br />\ndemolished.<br />\nBut patients will enter the Hospital<br />\nfrom the east, through a walkway over<br />\nWolf Street.<br />\nThe 4-story cancer center, to cost<br />\nabout S12-million in all, should be ready<br />\nto open sometime in 1976.<br />\nOver $14-million is slated for the<br />\npatient care structure, to be built in the<br />\nHospital's courtyard and adjacent to<br />\nHalstead, the surgery center.<br />\nIn addition, planned renovations in<br />\nHalstead, and Osler, the medicine<br />\nbuilding, should cost about $4-million.<br />\nIn addition to the Woman's Clinic,<br />\nthe Marburg building, for private<br />\npatients, is slated to be closed. Marburg,<br />\nalong with the domed building and the<br />\nWilmer Institute, will become national<br />\nlandmarks soon, if Hopkins proposals to<br />\nthe federal government are<br />\naccepted. The $38-million budgeted<br />\nfor the first phase of the redevelopment<br />\nalso includes about $2-million for added<br />\ngenerating capacity at the power plan,<br />\nand over S300,000 for parking. Site<br />\npreparation, including demolition, will<br />\ncost nearly S1.2-million, while<br />\nS4.8-million will be set aside for fees<br />\nand contingencies.<br />\nThe S100-million program, which May<br /><br />\nrun for 15 years, includes plans for<br />\nanother large patient care structure, next<br />\nto Osler.<br />\nThe first of the large patient care<br />\nbuilding, in addition to its beds, will<br />\nhouse the overflow from the Radiology<br />\nbuilding, and will replace the turn of the<br />\ncentury woman's clinic, on the Wolfe<br />\nStreet side of the Hospital. It will<br />\ninclude three delivery suites, six labor<br />\nrooms, and three gynecological operating<br />\nrooms.<br />\nClassrooms, conference rooms, and<br />\nother meeting areas are planned for the<br />\nareas shared bys the cancer center and<br />\nthe 180-bed building.<br />\nWhen Step 1 is completed in three<br />\nyears or so, the total number of hospital<br />\nbeds will be reduced from the present<br />\n1,065 to approximately 940. This<br />\nreduction should, Hospital officials say,<br />\nhike the total occupancy rate from the<br />\npresent sluggish 70 percent to about 85<br />\npercent.<br />\nThe plan is to encourage<br />\nHopkins-affiliated doctors to refer their<br />\npatients to the Hopkins Hospital, and<br />\nnot to more modern facilities in the<br />\nCounty.<br />\nAll the construction announced in the<br />\nStep 1 project is to take place in the<br />\nfour-block area circumscribed by the<br />\nparking lot adjacent to Broadway,<br /><br />\nMonument, Wolfe and Orleans Streets,<br />\nthe present site of the Hospital.<br />\nFollowing a period of expansion into<br />\nthe mostly poor and black neighborhod<br />\nin the early and mid-sixties, new<br />\nbuilding virtually ceased. The only<br />\nexception was the four-story Park<br />\nbuilding, for children's outpatient<br />\nservices, which opened in 1971.<br />\nDuring this period, Hospital<br />\nadministrators considered moving the<br />\nMedical Institutions out of the inner<br />\ncity, and to a more suburban location.<br />\nAround 1971, however, they decided to<br />\nkeep the Hospital in EAst Baltimore.<br />\nand promised community leaders that<br />\nthere would be no further expansion to<br />\nthe north or west.<br />\nBuilt in the sixties were the new basic<br />\nscience building, the Traylor research<br />\nbuilding, Turner Auditorium, and the<br />\nChildren's Medical and Surgical Center.<br />\nMore recently, the Hospital has<br />\nconsiderably expanded its health care<br />\ndelivery services, with8 clinics in the<br />\nplanned Howard County city, Columbia,<br />\nand in East Baltimore.<br />\nThe East Baltimore Medical Program,<br />\nbegun in late 1971, has several thousand<br />\npersons registered.<br />\nThe Program provides medical, dental,<br />\nand other health-related services for<br />\npre-payed members.<br /><br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br />\nPEKING GARDEN<br />\nChinese Restaurant<br />\n2410 E.
