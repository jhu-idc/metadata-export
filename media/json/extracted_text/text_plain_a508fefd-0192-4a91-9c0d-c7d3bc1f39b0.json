Mr.<br />\nL. B.

A<br />\nknowledge of what is being done<br />\nby the leading thinkers of all nations to abolish war should be a<br />\npart of every educated man's equipment; and it is the hope of the organizers of the new society to make<br />\nHopkins a center of information<br />\nand progress in this line.<br />\nA group of such organizations<br />\nas is planned is doing effective<br />\nwork among the colleges of the<br />\nMiddle West under the guidance<br />\nand control of the Intercollegiate<br />\nPeace Association.
