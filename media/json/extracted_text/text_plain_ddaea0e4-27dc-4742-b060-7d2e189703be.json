This means that there will<br />\nbe no more examinations at Christmas and Easter. Hereafter examinations will be held in February and<br />\nat the end of the year. It is proposed that informal marks be sent<br />\nout before the Christmas and Easter holidays to show the students<br />\nin what subjects they are back and<br />\nto give them a chance to catch up<br />\nduring the holidays. This is one<br />\nof the principal advantages in the<br />\nnew system. Another is that the<br />\nscholastic year will correspond to<br />\nthe fiscal year. The change to two<br />\nterms is desirable, also, because<br />\nseveral subjects such as Polyton II,<br />\nPhilosophy and Political Science<br />\ndo not lend themselves to a division<br />\ninto three parts.<br />\nSince, therefore, a mid-year examination is necessary for some of<br />\nthe students, it is advantageous to<br />\nhold it for all.<br />\nFor this year it vas further decided that the approaching spring<br />\nexaminations shall be held in the<br />\nmiddle of March instead of just before Easter, as has been the custom.<br />\nThe reason for this is that this year<br />\nEaster conies so late in the season<br />\nthat there would only have been<br />\nabout a month before the finals.<br />\nThe Faculty passed a resolution<br />\nrequesting the Board of Trustees<br />\nto establish a course of military<br />\ntraining at Hopkins, to be started<br />\nnext year in accordance with the<br />\nprovisions of the bill now before<br />\nCongress.

There are many<br />\npersons in Baltimore who, either<br />\nas spectators or competitors, can<br />\nvividly recall the first Hopkins contest. Those of us who were privileged to compete will never forget the mad dashes of those days<br />\naround a circular track of 21 laps<br />\nin a small hall (the old Fifth Regiment Armory), full of frenzied<br />\nspectators. The floor was long<br />\nenough to permit a 30-yard dash,<br />\nbut hurdle races, ma-yards and<br />\n..220-yards sprints were neither attempted nor dreamed of in the for<br />\nmer times. Similar limitations existed when the field events were<br />\nreached.<br />\nIt :s not with any spirit of criticism that these matters of the past<br />\nare touched upon; rather of rever2nce. For the men who were administratively in charge of the<br />\nearlier meets, as well as the stalwart few who fought so valiantly<br />\nfor the University in the actual<br />\ncompetition, unquestionably laid the<br />\nfoundation and established all of the<br />\ncustoms and policies of the present<br />\ncontests. The change from the old<br />\nto the new state of affairs took<br />\nplace so easily and gradually that<br />\nvery few Hopkins men look at the<br />\nmatter in any other light than<br />\n\"there has always been, and doubtless always will be, a big Hopkins<br />\nmeet each year.\"<br />\nThe earlier years have one cheerished tradition to hand down to the<br />\npresent university man. When the<br />\nnight of the indoor meet came<br />\naround, every then Hopkins' man<br />\nwas in his place at the meet. Social<br />\nengagements and personal pleasures were forgotten. There was<br />\norganized cheering, lots .of it, and<br />\nthe men on the team responded with<br />\na rush. Finally, one year the relay team defeated Pennsylvania<br />\nadmist a mighty roar, and the future of the indoor games was<br />\nestablished.<br />\nThe contest this season will be<br />\nof a higher calibre than ever. Cornell, Princeton, Georgetown, Virginia, Washington andLee,Pennsylvania and other colleges are sending<br />\nlarge and representative squads of<br />\nmen.

Both<br />\nwere equally enthusiastic over the<br />\nresults of the journey. They said<br />\nthat Ford's purpose has been entirely misunderstood in this country, and that the criticisms of Mr.<br />\nFord and his Peace Expedition are<br />\nwholly unjust.<br />\nOne of the most impressive things<br />\nabout the whole journey, they said,<br />\nwas that Henry Ford had taken<br />\nstudents from almost every prominent university in the country, not<br />\nwith any idea that they would have<br />\nany immediate effect in stopping the<br />\nwar, nor with the intention of having the students act as delegates to<br />\nany peace convention, but merely as<br />\nan education for the benefit of the<br />\nstudents themselves. Of course,<br />\nall these students are following international law and political science,<br />\nand, as this country's future diplomats and statesmen, they are expected eventually to use the experience and knowledge made possible<br />\nto them by the kindness of Ford<br />\nin the furtherance of the cause of<br />\ninternational peace.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Fell and Mr.<br />\nWilliams, the forty students who<br />\nsailed with Ford on the Oscar II<br />\nnumber, they have staunchly upheld the honor of Hopkins in a<br />\nhitherto unexplored field, is attested<br />\nby the scores of the contests which<br />\nthe Hopkins team has held with<br />\nthe teams of other universities. It is<br />\nsignificant of the prowess which<br />\nHopkins may eventually attain in<br />\nmarksmanship that already the team<br />\nof Penn State Military College, an<br />\ninstitution which has had rifle practice for years, has been met and defeated.<br />\nIn order to insure success in this<br />\nnew field, however, it is vitally necessary that more men take part in<br />\nthe weekly practices. Rumors are<br />\ncurrent about the University concerning the establishment of a<br />\ncourse in military training; a petition has been signed by students<br />\nasking that such a course be introduced; and yet interest in the Rifle<br />\nClub, which is directly in line with<br />\nsuch a movement, is maintained by<br />\nonly a few men! The Rifle Club<br />\nis a challenge to Hopkins, a direct<br />\ntest of the permanence of Hopkins<br />\nenthusiasm.

When<br />\nthe party arrived at Christiania at<br />\nthree in the morning, a delegation<br />\nof students from the University of<br />\nChristiania were present at the dock<br />\nto greet the party. The Norwegian students took the Americans<br />\nthrough their university, explained<br />\ntheir system of education, and exchanged opinions and ideas with<br />\nthem. So it was everywhere. The<br />\nlocal colleges welcomed the American students, banqu,eted them, took<br />\nthem sight-seeing, and did all in<br />\ntheir power to make their visit as<br />\nenjoyable and instructive as possible.<br />\nAfter trips through Norway and<br />\nSweden, the party went to Denmark. Here the reception given the<br />\nstudents was most elaborate. Besides attending the meetings arranged in their honor by the Danish universities, the American students went to the conferences held<br />\n.twice daily by the entire peace party<br />\nfor a discussion of the best methods<br />\nfor accomplishing the purposes of<br />\nthe expedition.<br />\nOn leaving Copenhagen, the<br />\npeace party went through Germany<br />\nto Holland. On the trip through<br />\nthe Teuton country, Mr. Williams<br />\nand Mr. Fell had a most interesting<br />\nexperience. They were in a compartment of the train with several<br />\nother students when a lieutenant in<br />\nthe German army entered and rode<br />\nwith them for several hours. Finding that his fellow-travelers were<br />\nstudents and not newspaper reporters, the soldier talked more freely<br />\nthan he would have otherwise, and<br />\ngave the students his ideas about<br />\nthe war, told them stories of the<br />\nfiring-line, and finally promised to<br />\ncome to America and visit them<br />\nafter Germany was victorious;<br />\nwhich result he prophesied would<br />\ncome to pass.<br />\nIn Holland, the party again received a cordial welcome. The<br />\nPeace Palace, which is kept tightly<br />\nlocked all the year, except during<br />\nInternational Peace Conferences,<br />\nwas opened for their benefit.<br />\nOn January 1o, the body of students left Rotterdam for the United<br />\nStates. The voyage home was as exciting as any portion of the whole<br />\njourney. On board were American<br />\nrefugees from Germany, Belgians<br />\n,and English, and from them the<br />\ncollege men were able to get valuable information concerning the<br />\nfinancial, economical and military<br />\ncondition of the warring nations.<br />\nThe ship encountered stormy<br />\nweather for two weeks and then<br />\nran out of coal, necessitating a stop<br />\nat Newfoundland before coming<br />\ndown to New York.

The<br />\nhall was decorated with palms and<br />\nflowers, and the music was furnished by Louis Fisher's orchestra. The<br />\nmain hall was crowded and many<br />\ncouples found solace in dancing in<br />\nthe surrounding corridors. At<br />\no'clock supper was served, after<br />\nwhich dancing continued until<br />\n12.30.<br />\nThe \"stag-line,\" which at previous Cotillons has been greatly reduced, was large, and consequently<br />\nthe dance ran more smoothly than<br />\nit had previously. A thing greatly<br />\nto be regretted was the absence of<br />\nthe Faculty who are generally well<br />\nrepresented at the Cotillons.<br />\nAfter 12.30 o'clock, the traditional hour of breaking up, the- music<br />\nplayed four or five extra dances<br />\nwhich were greatly appreciated.<br />\nThe attendance, when computed,<br />\nshowed that over one hundred<br />\ncouples, or two hundred people,<br />\nwere present. This is a record<br />\ncrowd for a Hopkins Cotillon, not<br />\nincluding, of course, the Senior<br />\n\"Proms;\" the next largest Cotillon<br />\nhaving been in the winter term of<br />\n1911, when one hundred and eighty<br />\nwere present.

His<br />\nplace has been filled by Robert R.<br />\nDuncan, '18.<br />\nThe subject of the debate is \"Resolved, That the President of the<br />\nUnited States should be elected to<br />\na single term of six years.\" The<br />\nAdams has the negative of the question. The members of the team are<br />\nalready at work gathering material<br />\nand planning their speeches.<br />\nBesides Duncan, the Adams team<br />\nconsists of Thomas J.

This arrangement, although<br />\nnot the one originally advocated by<br />\nthe Adams committee, was earnestly<br />\nsupported by the Philodemic, and is<br />\nentirely satisfactory to the Hopkins<br />\nmen. The first speaker for the<br />\nAdams will be Duncan; Oppenheimer will come next, and Tingley will conclude the debate.<br />\n<br />\nOwing to a conflict with the annual McCoy Hall concert of the<br />\nMusical Clubs, the date of debate<br />\nbetween the Adams Literary Society of this University and the Philodemic Society of Georgetown has<br />\nagain been changed.<br />\nThe former date was Friday,<br />\nFebruary 25. The debate committee of the Adams, in making this<br />\narrangement, overlooked the fact<br />\nthat the Musical Clubs had already<br />\nchosen that night for their McCoy<br />\nHall concert, and consequently<br />\nagreed when this date was suggested by the Philodemic. Realizing,<br />\nhowever, that it would be unadvis:<br />\nable to hold two Hopkins functions<br />\non the same night, and that the<br />\nmembers of the Adams team themselves wished to attend the Musical<br />\nClubs' function, the committee sent<br />\na letter to Georgetown, asking that<br />\nChess Players Busy.<br />\nthe debate be held at some other<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe Chess Club at Hopkins is<br />\nIn answer, the Philodemic com- enjoying one of the most successful<br />\nmittee suggested either Saturday 26 years of its existence.

This means that there will<br />\nbe no more examinations at Christmas and Easter. Hereafter examinations will be held in February and<br />\nat the end of the year. It is proposed that informal marks be sent<br />\nout before the Christmas and Easter holidays to show the students<br />\nin what subjects they are back and<br />\nto give them a chance to catch up<br />\nduring the holidays. This is one<br />\nof the principal advantages in the<br />\nnew system. Another is that the<br />\nscholastic year will correspond to<br />\nthe fiscal year.

There are many<br />\npersons in Baltimore who, either<br />\nas spectators or competitors, can<br />\nvividly recall the first Hopkins contest. Those of us who were privileged to compete will never forget the mad dashes of those days<br />\naround a circular track of 21 laps<br />\nin a small hall (the old Fifth Regiment Armory), full of frenzied<br />\nspectators. The floor was long<br />\nenough to permit a 30-yard dash,<br />\nbut hurdle races, ma-yards and<br />\n..220-yards sprints were neither attempted nor dreamed of in the for<br />\nmer times.

Both<br />\nwere equally enthusiastic over the<br />\nresults of the journey. They said<br />\nthat Ford's purpose has been entirely misunderstood in this country, and that the criticisms of Mr.<br />\nFord and his Peace Expedition are<br />\nwholly unjust.<br />\nOne of the most impressive things<br />\nabout the whole journey, they said,<br />\nwas that Henry Ford had taken<br />\nstudents from almost every prominent university in the country, not<br />\nwith any idea that they would have<br />\nany immediate effect in stopping the<br />\nwar, nor with the intention of having the students act as delegates to<br />\nany peace convention, but merely as<br />\nan education for the benefit of the<br />\nstudents themselves. Of course,<br />\nall these students are following international law and political science,<br />\nand, as this country's future diplomats and statesmen, they are expected eventually to use the experience and knowledge made possible<br />\nto them by the kindness of Ford<br />\nin the furtherance of the cause of<br />\ninternational peace.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Fell and Mr.<br />\nWilliams, the forty students who<br />\nsailed with Ford on the Oscar II<br />\nnumber, they have staunchly upheld the honor of Hopkins in a<br />\nhitherto unexplored field, is attested<br />\nby the scores of the contests which<br />\nthe Hopkins team has held with<br />\nthe teams of other universities. It is<br />\nsignificant of the prowess which<br />\nHopkins may eventually attain in<br />\nmarksmanship that already the team<br />\nof Penn State Military College, an<br />\ninstitution which has had rifle practice for years, has been met and defeated.<br />\nIn order to insure success in this<br />\nnew field, however, it is vitally necessary that more men take part in<br />\nthe weekly practices. Rumors are<br />\ncurrent about the University concerning the establishment of a<br />\ncourse in military training; a petition has been signed by students<br />\nasking that such a course be introduced; and yet interest in the Rifle<br />\nClub, which is directly in line with<br />\nsuch a movement, is maintained by<br />\nonly a few men!

When<br />\nthe party arrived at Christiania at<br />\nthree in the morning, a delegation<br />\nof students from the University of<br />\nChristiania were present at the dock<br />\nto greet the party. The Norwegian students took the Americans<br />\nthrough their university, explained<br />\ntheir system of education, and exchanged opinions and ideas with<br />\nthem. So it was everywhere. The<br />\nlocal colleges welcomed the American students, banqu,eted them, took<br />\nthem sight-seeing, and did all in<br />\ntheir power to make their visit as<br />\nenjoyable and instructive as possible.<br />\nAfter trips through Norway and<br />\nSweden, the party went to Denmark. Here the reception given the<br />\nstudents was most elaborate. Besides attending the meetings arranged in their honor by the Danish universities, the American students went to the conferences held<br />\n.twice daily by the entire peace party<br />\nfor a discussion of the best methods<br />\nfor accomplishing the purposes of<br />\nthe expedition.<br />\nOn leaving Copenhagen, the<br />\npeace party went through Germany<br />\nto Holland. On the trip through<br />\nthe Teuton country, Mr. Williams<br />\nand Mr. Fell had a most interesting<br />\nexperience. They were in a compartment of the train with several<br />\nother students when a lieutenant in<br />\nthe German army entered and rode<br />\nwith them for several hours. Finding that his fellow-travelers were<br />\nstudents and not newspaper reporters, the soldier talked more freely<br />\nthan he would have otherwise, and<br />\ngave the students his ideas about<br />\nthe war, told them stories of the<br />\nfiring-line, and finally promised to<br />\ncome to America and visit them<br />\nafter Germany was victorious;<br />\nwhich result he prophesied would<br />\ncome to pass.<br />\nIn Holland, the party again received a cordial welcome.

The<br />\nhall was decorated with palms and<br />\nflowers, and the music was furnished by Louis Fisher's orchestra. The<br />\nmain hall was crowded and many<br />\ncouples found solace in dancing in<br />\nthe surrounding corridors. At<br />\no'clock supper was served, after<br />\nwhich dancing continued until<br />\n12.30.<br />\nThe \"stag-line,\" which at previous Cotillons has been greatly reduced, was large, and consequently<br />\nthe dance ran more smoothly than<br />\nit had previously. A thing greatly<br />\nto be regretted was the absence of<br />\nthe Faculty who are generally well<br />\nrepresented at the Cotillons.<br />\nAfter 12.30 o'clock, the traditional hour of breaking up, the- music<br />\nplayed four or five extra dances<br />\nwhich were greatly appreciated.<br />\nThe attendance, when computed,<br />\nshowed that over one hundred<br />\ncouples, or two hundred people,<br />\nwere present. This is a record<br />\ncrowd for a Hopkins Cotillon, not<br />\nincluding, of course, the Senior<br />\n\"Proms;\" the next largest Cotillon<br />\nhaving been in the winter term of<br />\n1911, when one hundred and eighty<br />\nwere present.

The<br />\nusual matches will be played and<br />\ntrack and swimming meets will be<br />\nheld, but an unusual effort will be<br />\nmade to give every man at the conference an opportunity for sufficient<br />\nexercise every afternoon.

Steinbach from the team, due to the<br />\npressure of collegiate work. His<br />\nplace has been filled by Robert R.<br />\nDuncan, '18.<br />\nThe subject of the debate is \"Resolved, That the President of the<br />\nUnited States should be elected to<br />\na single term of six years.\" The<br />\nAdams has the negative of the question. The members of the team are<br />\nalready at work gathering material<br />\nand planning their speeches.<br />\nBesides Duncan, the Adams team<br />\nconsists of Thomas J. Tingley and<br />\nReuben' Oppenheimer. Each of<br />\nthese men will make a first speech<br />\nof ten minutes and a rebuttal of<br />\nfive. This arrangement, although<br />\nnot the one originally advocated by<br />\nthe Adams committee, was earnestly<br />\nsupported by the Philodemic, and is<br />\nentirely satisfactory to the Hopkins<br />\nmen. The first speaker for the<br />\nAdams will be Duncan; Oppenheimer will come next, and Tingley will conclude the debate.<br /><br />\nOwing to a conflict with the annual McCoy Hall concert of the<br />\nMusical Clubs, the date of debate<br />\nbetween the Adams Literary Society of this University and the Philodemic Society of Georgetown has<br />\nagain been changed.<br />\nThe former date was Friday,<br />\nFebruary 25. The debate committee of the Adams, in making this<br />\narrangement, overlooked the fact<br />\nthat the Musical Clubs had already<br />\nchosen that night for their McCoy<br />\nHall concert, and consequently<br />\nagreed when this date was suggested by the Philodemic. Realizing,<br />\nhowever, that it would be unadvis:<br />\nable to hold two Hopkins functions<br />\non the same night, and that the<br />\nmembers of the Adams team themselves wished to attend the Musical<br />\nClubs' function, the committee sent<br />\na letter to Georgetown, asking that<br />\nChess Players Busy.<br />\nthe debate be held at some other<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe Chess Club at Hopkins is<br />\nIn answer, the Philodemic com- enjoying one of the most successful<br />\nmittee suggested either Saturday 26 years of its existence.
