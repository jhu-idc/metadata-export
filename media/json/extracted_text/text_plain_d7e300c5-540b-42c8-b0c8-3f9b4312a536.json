The biggest<br />\nsurprise, other than the announcement itself, came when Muller<br />\nadded that he will seek the<br />\nRepublican, not the Democratic,<br />\nnomination.<br />\n<br />\nIn his statement prepared<br />\nby the News-Letter staff, Muller<br />\nexplained his decision to go<br />\nRepublican was based on his<br />\nbelief that the GOP nomination<br />\nwould be easier to capture.<br />\n\"Who do they have running,<br />\nreally? Besides a few neo-Nazis<br />\nfrom the cornfields, they don't<br />\nhave anyone who can count<br />\nhigher than ten without a<br />\ntele-prompter.

We plan to<br />\nemploy many symbols in the<br />\ncourse of the campaign. We feel<br />\nthat Dr. Muller himself is a<br />\nsymbol of upwardly mobile,<br />\nmaterialistic, avaricious egoism.<br />\nIn short, of this great country<br />\nitself.<br />\n\"And let's not forget the<br />\nlittle immigrant's background.<br />\nRonald Reagan better take<br />\nnotice that he's not the only<br />\nwashed-up bit-player in this<br />\ncampaign.\"<br />\nAt the conference, Muller<br />\noutlined the themes of his<br />\nupcoming campaign, stressing<br />\nhis talents in international and<br />\nsexual relations, his tan, and his<br />\nbelief that the issues during the<br />\ncampaign will focus abroad<br />\nrather than at home. \"With the<br />\nway the current Administration<br />\nis continuously blocking foreign<br />\naffairs, we should have plenty of<br />\njuicy crises to worry about<br />\nduring the whole campaign,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nMuller also stressed his<br />\nexperiences with deficit spending. \"I've been running a big<br />\ninstitution in the red for a long<br />\ntime now. I look forward to<br />\nbeing able to improve on the<br />\nrecord of the current administration. With the help of the<br />\nAmerican people, we'll soon<br />\nhave the biggest goddamn deficit<br />\nin the history of the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nMuller expressed hope that<br />\neven while increasing the Federal<br />\ndeficit, he would be able to cut<br />\nthe size of the Federal bureaucracy. Citing his record of<br />\ncutting back on the Homewood<br />\nfaculty, Muller said,\"I've always<br />\nbeen able to fire people, and get<br />\nothers to take the blame. It's<br />\neasy when you're as greasy as<br />\nI am.\"<br />\nMuller's choice of Spiro<br />\nAgnew as running !pate surprised<br />\npeople almost as much as the<br />\nfact that he announced his<br />\ndecision. When questioned on<br />\nhis motives, Muller intimated<br />\nthat he felt there was no quicker<br />\nway to win the hearts of Republican stalwarts than to pick<br />\nAgnew. \"Besides, the money<br />\nhe's saved me on income taxes<br />\nCow. p.7<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2 / DECEMBER 7, 1979<br />\n<br />\nToo Busy TO GET<br />\nIT TypEd?<br />\n<br />\nJSA Notes<br />\nEntertainment free of<br />\nAttention!<br />\ncharge.

According to the pair,<br />\nthe SAC chairman waved a 7MM<br />\nmauser in their faces and shouted \"This is a goddamn closed<br />\nmeeting, schmucks! Scram or<br />\nI'll drill ya!\" The witnesses<br />\nunderstandably had little time to<br />\nobserve the scene, but one later<br />\nsaid that \"There was a lot of<br />\nblood, and some people were<br />\nrunning around while others<br />\nwere just slumped over the<br />\ntables. The room was full of<br />\nsmoke.\"<br />\nThe two witnesses then<br />\nalerted the News-Letter by<br />\nphone, but there was some delay<br />\nbecause the call was at first<br />\nassumed to be a prank. When<br />\nN-L staffers finally arrived at the<br />\nShriver Hall lobby, they were<br />\nimmediately tired upon from the<br />\ndirection of the Board room and<br />\nforced to take cover in a stairwell.

There was just a lot of<br />\nsilliness here tonight.\"<br />\nWhen asked if there had<br />\nbeen any fatalities, Elkin looked<br />\nwhistful and admitted, \"Yes,<br />\nyes, Tom's dead.

Why don't we go<br />\nfor coffee?\"<br />\n;<br />\nGroans emanating from the<br />\ndirection of the board room<br />\nprompted reporters to sidestep<br />\nthe biahbering Elkin and view<br />\nthe slaughterhouse for themselves.

The concert was in the<br />\nfront room of the Walter's Art gallery.<br />\nThe room is a clean, well-lit place. Vivaldi is baroque, but the musicians executed<br />\nhim cleanly and with style. I remember<br />\nhow Belmonte, the violinist, came onto<br />\nthe paltform. lie placed one foot in front<br />\nof the other and then repeated the action<br />\nagain several times. But it was the way he<br />\nscratched his nose that was important. It<br />\nwas the fact of that action that will evoke<br />\nthe emotion now, and if I'm good enough, always.<br />\nBelmonte was weighty but not<br />\nfat. He bore on his face the marks of the<br />\nsevere acne he has endured in his youth at<br />\nthe conservatory. Belmonte's work with<br />\nthe violin was fine. His handling of the<br />\nbow had been brilliant. I have seen him<br />\nface a difficult violin with his feet together teasing it with his bow. But he had not<br />\nyet recovered from the effects of a<br />\nsevere press goring received the year<br />\nbefore. In this performance his work was<br />\ngood but not great.<br />\nThe harpsichordist was called<br />\nRalph by everyone. He showed promise<br />\nat the start but proved to be a coward.<br />\nIf he was given a difficult passage, he<br />\nwould disguise his moves with a flourish.<br />\nThis was to make his playing look more<br />\ndangerous than it was(the mincing fairy.)<br />\nIt was no surprise to me. The harpsichord has always been considered to be in<br />\na period of decadence.<br />\nThe hero of the day was Allen<br />\nKonigsberg. He was short. He has<br />\nfreckles. His glasses were thick. But his<br />\nridiculous appearence could be overlooked because of his fine work with<br />\nthe clarinet. His first piece was fair. He<br />\nfinished it perfectly but there was none<br />\nof that feeling of immortality that comes<br />\nwith a truly great piece. His second piece<br />\n<br />\na fine one. it was short, but its bass<br />\nwas sturdy, and at its crescendo the notes<br />\nmove smooth and easy. Konigsberg was<br />\nplaying the piece with the courage of one<br />\nwho has known fear and known it truly.<br />\nHe was giving the piece a chance to<br />\nshow its power. Near the end of the<br />\nAllegro he fainted. The strain of the<br />\npiece has caused his sinuses to hemorrhage. This happened often. He would be<br />\ncarried into the infirmary, revived, and<br />\nbrought out again to play another piece. I<br />\nsipped cognac and laughed at his witty<br />\napologies. The audience did not like it.<br />\nIt was old news to everyone. But, by<br />\nChrist, how I admired him.<br />\nKonigsberg had returned from the<br />\ninfirmary for the third time to begin an<br />\nover-written piece. I heard hoof beats on<br />\nthe marble floor. A black fighting bull<br />\ncame into the room. He was a Veragua<br />\nbull about four years old. He was a good<br />\nbull. The knot of muscles at his shoulders was hard and stood erect. It excited<br />\nme to see him. The first thing the bull<br />\nwas the harpsichordist. There<br />\nsaw<br />\nwas no fear in his eyes as he lifted the<br />\nfellow out of his chas chair and flung him<br />\nback over his neck. The other musicians<br />\nstood and watched holding their instru-<br />\n<br />\nments by their sides.<br />\nNext the bull drove his right horn<br />\ninto Belmonte's leg. He crushed the<br />\nviolin with his hoof. I stood on my chair<br />\nto get a clearer view. The horn had<br />\nrented Belmonte's thigh to the bone. I<br />\njotted down some notes so I would<br />\n<br />\nremember my immediate impressions.<br />\nIn the first row there was an old man who<br />\nhad been sleeping, and had not noticed<br />\nthe. disturbance. The bull killed the<br />\nman and smashed his monocle. The bull<br />\nmoved around the room demolishing the<br />\ninstruments and the people. I could tell<br />\nhe had one of the great fighting strains<br />\nin his blood. My sports jacket had a red<br />\nlining. I held it under my arm in readiness. A man pulled out a pistol to<br />\nprotect his wife and child. They lay in<br />\nred bund bundles where the bull had<br />\ntossed them. The man was an amateur<br />\nwith the gun, and the bull had hooked<br />\nhim deep in the groin before he had a<br />\nchance to cock. The man continued to<br />\nstruggle with the pistol after the bull had<br />\npassed. I went over to him.<br />\n\"You've been wounded,\" I said.<br />\n\"Take a powder, old man,\" he said. I said<br />\nnothing and went back to my seat. Later<br />\nI saw the man again. He was attempting<br />\nto stop the flow of blood from between<br />\nhis legs with his hand. To watch a man at<br />\nthis time should, I suppose, evoke a gut<br />\nreaction. However, I could not help<br />\nseeing the comic aspects of his predicament.<br />\nThe rampage of the bull was<br />\ngrowing tedious. Allen Konigsberg had<br />\nhad another hemmorrhage. He could not<br />\nplay the bull with his usual skill. I held<br />\nmy sports jacket for the bull to pass, but<br />\nhe was distracted by the women and their<br />\nshrill squeals. Gertrude Stein stepped out<br />\nfrom behind the bass fiddle. She was<br />\ndressed in the nuleta and padded d<br />\njacket of a matador. In a few passes she<br />\nhad brought the bull to its knees.<br />\nIt was good concert but not a<br />\ngreat concert. Konigsberg came over to<br />\nme wiping his forehead with a cloth. We<br />\nagreed that we preferred the bull to<br />\nVivaldi. The bull had been completely<br />\nbrave. Afterward we had a fine meal at<br />\nthe cafe.<br />\n<br />\nTuberman<br />\nMr. Potato Head opened at the<br />\nHandyman Theatre this week to rave<br />\nreviews.

There is an especially<br />\nheavy emphasis on his \"Notes from the<br />\nUnderground,\" which critics have always<br />\ndescribed as the author's work most<br />\nreadily adaptible to the stage, because of<br />\nits light, yet robustly psychotic quality.<br />\ncenters<br />\nThe action of the musical<br />\n<br />\nroughly around the character of Boris<br />\nBideoyskin, a lowly, snivelling, introverted, pathologically balding government<br />\nclerk in 19th century St. Petersburg.

The<br />\nchoreography, characteristically Dostoeveskian in its duality of statement,<br />\nenhances the dramatic rhythm of the<br />\nmusical, without detracting from its<br />\nengaging senselessness.<br />\nIt is of special note that the score<br />\nis written by the celebrated husband and<br />\nwife team of Masters and Johnson,<br />\nperhaps best known for their 1976 Tony<br />\nAward Winning musical \"What's Your<br />\nProblem? \" The lyrics, by Masters, and<br />\nthe music, also by Masters (Johnson<br />\ntypes), are often piquant and quite<br />\nmemorable, especially since every song<br />\nhas the same melody.)<br />\nThe continuity of the remainder<br />\nof the play is somewhat strained in that it<br />\nis only maintained by Boris' random<br />\nperiodic appearances from skit to skit, in<br />\nwhich he pops out of the wings, yells<br />\n<br />\n.Dress rehearsal: Whopping entertainment for the whole family<br />\n\"Hiya, folks!\", and is dragged off stage,<br />\nonly to resurface in a subsequent skit.<br />\nNot only was this device previously<br />\nemployed, with limited success, in Jasper<br />\nKoogan's miserable \"Cosgrove on the<br />\nMt.\" but it also appears to have been<br />\ndone at the indiscriminate whim of Mr.<br />\nRooney, who is heard to kick and scream<br />\nbackstage between each appearance.<br />\nAside from this structural drawback,<br />\nalong with a few other minor ones, such<br />\nas the lack of overhead lighting, and the<br />\noccasional fainting of certain members of<br />\nthe cast, the show holds up considerably<br />\nwell. The finale is especially rewarding.<br />\nBoris struts out onto the stage with a<br />\nstraw hat, spats, and a cane, and is joined<br />\nby all of the major characters of Dostoevesky's works, similarly garbed, who<br />\ntrample him to death as he croons \"This<br />\nis the Way to Go.\"<br />\nFor avid fans of Dostoevsky's<br />\nfiction, or even for simple self-destructive, manic-depressive theater-goers, \"Underground Follies\" is a must, a schizophrenic grab-bag of psychological bellylaughs.

Bob Scott,<br />\nthe new general manager of the<br />\nBaltimore club, said \"With the<br />\nuse of the stadium, we could<br />\ndraw maybe 20,000 a game, and<br />\nthat's better than the other team<br />\ncould draw.\"<br />\nScott was here referring to<br />\nthe newly departed Jacksonville<br />\nColts who were moved earlier<br />\nthis week by owner Bob Irsay<br />\nsoon after replacing Head Coach<br />\nTed Marchibroda by Notre<br />\nDame's Ara Parshegan and JHU's<br />\nown Howdy Myers. The Jays<br />\nare now scheduled to play their<br />\nThursday night televised con-<br />\n<br />\nThroats v. Nerds<br />\nThe bi-annual Johns Hopkins University Memorial NerdThroat Race is nearing its<br />\ndramatic finish, and is likely to<br />\nbe as exciting this year as usual.<br />\nAs always, team strategy shows<br />\npolar variation, with the Nerds<br />\nopting for maximum defensive<br />\nstrategies while the Throats<br />\nmount an efficient, and sometimes spontaneous, offensive<br />\nthreat. At present, two weeks<br />\nbefore the race is officially<br />\ndeclared over, the Nerds are<br />\nstrongly in the lead.<br />\nThe coach of the Nerds, too<br />\nbusy studying to give his name,<br />\nmumbled a few words while<br />\nbreaking in a new hi-liter pen. .<br />\n\"We're using game plans proven<br />\nto be winners in the past,\"<br />\nhe said, \"like preparing outlines<br />\nfor final papers soon after<br />\nsyllabi are handed out in September, working a minimum of<br />\nnine hours each weeknight, a<br />\nminimum of sixteen hours on<br />\nSaturday and Sunday, and boycotting all social functions.

I<br />\nalso check for writer's cramp,<br />\neyestrain, and backache -- three<br />\n<br />\nsigns of a truly dedicated player.\"<br />\nThe Throats' coach talked<br />\nat length about his team's<br />\ngame strategy while sitting<br />\nin the Rat \"We've got some<br />\ngoodies up our sleeves this<br />\nyear,\" he claimed. Though he<br />\nwas necessarily reluctant to give<br />\ndetails, he noted that great<br />\nstrides have been made toward<br />\nThroating in departments other<br />\nthan Biology, Chemistry, and<br />\nNatural Sciences... including, among others, a Tape Scramble in<br />\nthe Language Lab. \"Wait till<br />\nthose Frenchies get ready to<br />\ntake dictation and instead get an<br />\nearful of an Intro-Arabic quiz...\"<br />\nThe Throat coach also plans to<br />\nutilize \"tried and true\" methods<br />\nof the past; chiefly, bragging,<br />\ngloating, prying, stealing, lying,<br />\nbuying, and buttering.<br />\nThough clearly out in front<br />\npresently, the Nerds cannot<br />\nrelax and enjoy their lead (not<br />\nthat they would anyway), because the Throats customarily<br />\nmount their most intense offensive drive quite late in the<br />\nrunning. This year seems to be<br />\nno exception. \"If all else fails,\"<br />\nsays the Throat coach,\"we have<br />\nfive optional Incompletes to pull<br />\nwhen the going gets tough.\"<br />\n<br />\ndecision had nothing to do with<br />\nthe NBC handling of the championship game. In a prepared<br />\nstatement issued this morning,<br />\nHantz declared, \"The need for<br />\nprofessional sport with the excitement of Lacrosse is exactly<br />\n.what the public wants today. It<br />\nis only natural then that the<br />\ncolleges of America should be<br />\nasked to fill this new professional opening.\"<br />\nThe coach of the newly<br />\ncreated Baltimore Blue Jays,<br />\nHenry \"Chic\" Ciccarone, was<br />\nenthusiastic about the media<br />\npotential of the International<br />\nLax League (ILL). \"Maybe we'll<br />\nget on TV when real people can<br />\nsee us, not just crazed sports<br />\nwriters and insomniacs.\"<br />\n<br />\nExcitement Surrounds<br />\nArrival Of New Coaches<br />\namt. from p. 20<br />\nbackfields all over the conference!\"<br />\nAsked what other refinements the new coaching triumverate had recommended, Howdy Myers made several sage<br />\nobservations.<br />\n\"Last year our big problem<br />\nwas team strength,\" the Blue Jay<br />\nmentor. observed. \"But by the<br />\ntime our new spring training<br />\nprogram gets into full swing<br />\nnext March, we'll have every<br />\nplayer over the two hundred<br />\npound mark, thanks to our<br />\nnew program of lifting and<br />\nsteroid development.

The concert was in the<br />\nfront room of the Walter's Art gallery.<br />\nThe room is a clean, well-lit place. Vivaldi is baroque, but the musicians executed<br />\nhim cleanly and with style. I remember<br />\nhow Belmonte, the violinist, came onto<br />\nthe paltform. lie placed one foot in front<br />\nof the other and then repeated the action<br />\nagain several times. But it was the way he<br />\nscratched his nose that was important. It<br />\nwas the fact of that action that will evoke<br />\nthe emotion now, and if I'm good enough, always.<br />\nBelmonte was weighty but not<br />\nfat. He bore on his face the marks of the<br />\nsevere acne he has endured in his youth at<br />\nthe conservatory. Belmonte's work with<br />\nthe violin was fine. His handling of the<br />\nbow had been brilliant. I have seen him<br />\nface a difficult violin with his feet together teasing it with his bow. But he had not<br />\nyet recovered from the effects of a<br />\nsevere press goring received the year<br />\nbefore. In this performance his work was<br />\ngood but not great.<br />\nThe harpsichordist was called<br />\nRalph by everyone. He showed promise<br />\nat the start but proved to be a coward.<br />\nIf he was given a difficult passage, he<br />\nwould disguise his moves with a flourish.<br />\nThis was to make his playing look more<br />\ndangerous than it was(the mincing fairy.)<br />\nIt was no surprise to me. The harpsichord has always been considered to be in<br />\na period of decadence.<br />\nThe hero of the day was Allen<br />\nKonigsberg. He was short. He has<br />\nfreckles. His glasses were thick. But his<br />\nridiculous appearence could be overlooked because of his fine work with<br />\nthe clarinet. His first piece was fair. He<br />\nfinished it perfectly but there was none<br />\nof that feeling of immortality that comes<br />\nwith a truly great piece. His second piece<br /><br />\na fine one. it was short, but its bass<br />\nwas sturdy, and at its crescendo the notes<br />\nmove smooth and easy. Konigsberg was<br />\nplaying the piece with the courage of one<br />\nwho has known fear and known it truly.<br />\nHe was giving the piece a chance to<br />\nshow its power. Near the end of the<br />\nAllegro he fainted. The strain of the<br />\npiece has caused his sinuses to hemorrhage. This happened often. He would be<br />\ncarried into the infirmary, revived, and<br />\nbrought out again to play another piece. I<br />\nsipped cognac and laughed at his witty<br />\napologies. The audience did not like it.<br />\nIt was old news to everyone. But, by<br />\nChrist, how I admired him.<br />\nKonigsberg had returned from the<br />\ninfirmary for the third time to begin an<br />\nover-written piece. I heard hoof beats on<br />\nthe marble floor. A black fighting bull<br />\ncame into the room. He was a Veragua<br />\nbull about four years old. He was a good<br />\nbull. The knot of muscles at his shoulders was hard and stood erect. It excited<br />\nme to see him. The first thing the bull<br />\nwas the harpsichordist. There<br />\nsaw<br />\nwas no fear in his eyes as he lifted the<br />\nfellow out of his chas chair and flung him<br />\nback over his neck. The other musicians<br />\nstood and watched holding their instru-<br /><br />\nments by their sides.<br />\nNext the bull drove his right horn<br />\ninto Belmonte's leg. He crushed the<br />\nviolin with his hoof. I stood on my chair<br />\nto get a clearer view. The horn had<br />\nrented Belmonte's thigh to the bone. I<br />\njotted down some notes so I would<br /><br />\nremember my immediate impressions.<br />\nIn the first row there was an old man who<br />\nhad been sleeping, and had not noticed<br />\nthe. disturbance. The bull killed the<br />\nman and smashed his monocle. The bull<br />\nmoved around the room demolishing the<br />\ninstruments and the people. I could tell<br />\nhe had one of the great fighting strains<br />\nin his blood. My sports jacket had a red<br />\nlining. I held it under my arm in readiness. A man pulled out a pistol to<br />\nprotect his wife and child. They lay in<br />\nred bund bundles where the bull had<br />\ntossed them. The man was an amateur<br />\nwith the gun, and the bull had hooked<br />\nhim deep in the groin before he had a<br />\nchance to cock. The man continued to<br />\nstruggle with the pistol after the bull had<br />\npassed. I went over to him.<br />\n\"You've been wounded,\" I said.<br />\n\"Take a powder, old man,\" he said. I said<br />\nnothing and went back to my seat. Later<br />\nI saw the man again. He was attempting<br />\nto stop the flow of blood from between<br />\nhis legs with his hand. To watch a man at<br />\nthis time should, I suppose, evoke a gut<br />\nreaction. However, I could not help<br />\nseeing the comic aspects of his predicament.<br />\nThe rampage of the bull was<br />\ngrowing tedious. Allen Konigsberg had<br />\nhad another hemmorrhage. He could not<br />\nplay the bull with his usual skill. I held<br />\nmy sports jacket for the bull to pass, but<br />\nhe was distracted by the women and their<br />\nshrill squeals. Gertrude Stein stepped out<br />\nfrom behind the bass fiddle. She was<br />\ndressed in the nuleta and padded d<br />\njacket of a matador. In a few passes she<br />\nhad brought the bull to its knees.<br />\nIt was good concert but not a<br />\ngreat concert. Konigsberg came over to<br />\nme wiping his forehead with a cloth. We<br />\nagreed that we preferred the bull to<br />\nVivaldi. The bull had been completely<br />\nbrave. Afterward we had a fine meal at<br />\nthe cafe.<br /><br />\nTuberman<br />\nMr. Potato Head opened at the<br />\nHandyman Theatre this week to rave<br />\nreviews.

There is an especially<br />\nheavy emphasis on his \"Notes from the<br />\nUnderground,\" which critics have always<br />\ndescribed as the author's work most<br />\nreadily adaptible to the stage, because of<br />\nits light, yet robustly psychotic quality.<br />\ncenters<br />\nThe action of the musical<br /><br />\nroughly around the character of Boris<br />\nBideoyskin, a lowly, snivelling, introverted, pathologically balding government<br />\nclerk in 19th century St. Petersburg.

The<br />\ndancers, all dressed as grubby, dissheveiled government employees, perform<br />\nadequately, although they are hampered<br />\nby their tendency to slip and topple to<br />\nthe stage domino style, and by the<br />\nweakness \u2022 of the floorboards, which<br />\noccasionally give way under certain<br />\ncast members during the show,.to the<br />\ndelighted squeals of the audience. The<br />\nchoreography, characteristically Dostoeveskian in its duality of statement,<br />\nenhances the dramatic rhythm of the<br />\nmusical, without detracting from its<br />\nengaging senselessness.<br />\nIt is of special note that the score<br />\nis written by the celebrated husband and<br />\nwife team of Masters and Johnson,<br />\nperhaps best known for their 1976 Tony<br />\nAward Winning musical \"What's Your<br />\nProblem? \" The lyrics, by Masters, and<br />\nthe music, also by Masters (Johnson<br />\ntypes), are often piquant and quite<br />\nmemorable, especially since every song<br />\nhas the same melody.)<br />\nThe continuity of the remainder<br />\nof the play is somewhat strained in that it<br />\nis only maintained by Boris' random<br />\nperiodic appearances from skit to skit, in<br />\nwhich he pops out of the wings, yells<br /><br />\n.Dress rehearsal: Whopping entertainment for the whole family<br />\n\"Hiya, folks!\", and is dragged off stage,<br />\nonly to resurface in a subsequent skit.<br />\nNot only was this device previously<br />\nemployed, with limited success, in Jasper<br />\nKoogan's miserable \"Cosgrove on the<br />\nMt.\" but it also appears to have been<br />\ndone at the indiscriminate whim of Mr.<br />\nRooney, who is heard to kick and scream<br />\nbackstage between each appearance.<br />\nAside from this structural drawback,<br />\nalong with a few other minor ones, such<br />\nas the lack of overhead lighting, and the<br />\noccasional fainting of certain members of<br />\nthe cast, the show holds up considerably<br />\nwell. The finale is especially rewarding.<br />\nBoris struts out onto the stage with a<br />\nstraw hat, spats, and a cane, and is joined<br />\nby all of the major characters of Dostoevesky's works, similarly garbed, who<br />\ntrample him to death as he croons \"This<br />\nis the Way to Go.\"<br />\nFor avid fans of Dostoevsky's<br />\nfiction, or even for simple self-destructive, manic-depressive theater-goers, \"Underground Follies\" is a must, a schizophrenic grab-bag of psychological bellylaughs.

Nerds<br />\nThe bi-annual Johns Hopkins University Memorial NerdThroat Race is nearing its<br />\ndramatic finish, and is likely to<br />\nbe as exciting this year as usual.<br />\nAs always, team strategy shows<br />\npolar variation, with the Nerds<br />\nopting for maximum defensive<br />\nstrategies while the Throats<br />\nmount an efficient, and sometimes spontaneous, offensive<br />\nthreat. At present, two weeks<br />\nbefore the race is officially<br />\ndeclared over, the Nerds are<br />\nstrongly in the lead.<br />\nThe coach of the Nerds, too<br />\nbusy studying to give his name,<br />\nmumbled a few words while<br />\nbreaking in a new hi-liter pen. .<br />\n\"We're using game plans proven<br />\nto be winners in the past,\"<br />\nhe said, \"like preparing outlines<br />\nfor final papers soon after<br />\nsyllabi are handed out in September, working a minimum of<br />\nnine hours each weeknight, a<br />\nminimum of sixteen hours on<br />\nSaturday and Sunday, and boycotting all social functions.

Though he<br />\nwas necessarily reluctant to give<br />\ndetails, he noted that great<br />\nstrides have been made toward<br />\nThroating in departments other<br />\nthan Biology, Chemistry, and<br />\nNatural Sciences... including, among others, a Tape Scramble in<br />\nthe Language Lab. \"Wait till<br />\nthose Frenchies get ready to<br />\ntake dictation and instead get an<br />\nearful of an Intro-Arabic quiz...\"<br />\nThe Throat coach also plans to<br />\nutilize \"tried and true\" methods<br />\nof the past; chiefly, bragging,<br />\ngloating, prying, stealing, lying,<br />\nbuying, and buttering.<br />\nThough clearly out in front<br />\npresently, the Nerds cannot<br />\nrelax and enjoy their lead (not<br />\nthat they would anyway), because the Throats customarily<br />\nmount their most intense offensive drive quite late in the<br />\nrunning. This year seems to be<br />\nno exception. \"If all else fails,\"<br />\nsays the Throat coach,\"we have<br />\nfive optional Incompletes to pull<br />\nwhen the going gets tough.\"<br /><br />\ndecision had nothing to do with<br />\nthe NBC handling of the championship game. In a prepared<br />\nstatement issued this morning,<br />\nHantz declared, \"The need for<br />\nprofessional sport with the excitement of Lacrosse is exactly<br />\n.what the public wants today. It<br />\nis only natural then that the<br />\ncolleges of America should be<br />\nasked to fill this new professional opening.\"<br />\nThe coach of the newly<br />\ncreated Baltimore Blue Jays,<br />\nHenry \"Chic\" Ciccarone, was<br />\nenthusiastic about the media<br />\npotential of the International<br />\nLax League (ILL). \"Maybe we'll<br />\nget on TV when real people can<br />\nsee us, not just crazed sports<br />\nwriters and insomniacs.\"<br /><br />\nExcitement Surrounds<br />\nArrival Of New Coaches<br />\namt. from p. 20<br />\nbackfields all over the conference!\"<br />\nAsked what other refinements the new coaching triumverate had recommended, Howdy Myers made several sage<br />\nobservations.<br />\n\"Last year our big problem<br />\nwas team strength,\" the Blue Jay<br />\nmentor. observed. \"But by the<br />\ntime our new spring training<br />\nprogram gets into full swing<br />\nnext March, we'll have every<br />\nplayer over the two hundred<br />\npound mark, thanks to our<br />\nnew program of lifting and<br />\nsteroid development.
