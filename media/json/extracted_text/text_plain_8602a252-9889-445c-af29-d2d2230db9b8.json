I know I have also<br />\nrealized this aim in many other columns during the year, but<br />\nthat was not for lack of trying. Today I am not trying. I am not<br />\ntrying for two reasons: First, because you are getting ready for<br />\nfinal exams and in your present state of shock, nothing in the<br />\nworld could possibly make you laugh. And second, this final<br />\ncolumn of the year is for many of us a leave-taking, and goodbyes always make me too misty to be funny.<br />\nFor me the year ends neither with a bang nor a whimper, but<br />\nwith a glow\u2014a warm, pleasant, mellow glow\u2014the kind of glow<br />\nyou will find, for example, at the end of a Philip Morris or<br />\nMarlboro.<br />\nIt has been in every Way a gratifying experience, my five<br />\nyears with the makers of Philip Morris and Marlboro, and I<br />\nwould like to take this 'opportunity\" to extend my heartfelt<br />\nappreciation to these good tobacconists, to assure _them that<br />\nthe memory of their kindness will remain ever green in my<br />\nheart, and to remind them that they still owe me for the last<br />\nthree columns.<br />\nAnd in these waning days of the school year, let me address<br />\nmyself seriously to you, my readers. Have I trod on any toes<br />\nthis year? Ruffled any feelings? Jostled any sensibilities? If<br />\nso, I am sorry.<br />\nHave I occasioned any laughs? Chuckles? Sniggers? Mona<br />\nLisa smiles? If so, I'm glad.<br />\nHave I persuaded any of you to try Philip- Morris and<br />\nMarlboro? To taste that fine flavor? lb smoke that excellent<br />\ntobaCco? If so; you are glad.<br />\nAnd now the long, lazy summer lies ahead. But for me summer is never lazy. It is, in fact, the busiest time of year. Two<br />\nsummers ago, for instance, I was out ringing doorbells every<br />\nsingle day, morning, noon, and night.

It is a lacrosse axiom that any<br />\n\"Up\" team can often defeat a<br />\nbetter \"down\" team.
