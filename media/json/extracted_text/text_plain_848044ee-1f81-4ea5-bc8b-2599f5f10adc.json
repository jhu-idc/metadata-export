GOODGOLD<br />\nWith all the activities of the<br />\nschool year already slowly<br />\nprogressing, C. Wayne Hood,the<br />\nnew head of financial aid for<br />\nHopkins, officially started his<br />\nnew job here yesterday.<br />\nHood, who for the past two<br />\nyears has been the financial aid<br />\ndirector at UMBC;said that he<br />\nwas \"anxious to begin\" his new<br />\nwork.<br />\nAs the new financial aid chief,<br />\nhe said he hopes to change the<br />\nimage of the Financial Aid office<br />\nto that of a more affable and<br />\n\"efficient\" unit. Among the<br />\nchanges he is now working on is<br />\nthe designing of a new pamphlet<br />\non financial aid as well as a new<br />\nfinancial aid application form.<br />\nHe also stressed that he would<br />\ninitiate an improved \"public<br />\nrelations\" program with the<br />\nstudent to make \"work a little<br />\neasier for the students and<br />\nuniversity itself.\"<br />\nHood felt that the \"personal<br />\nelement\" should be understood<br />\nwhen receiving financial aid. \"A<br />\nlot of students for one reason or<br />\nanother need financial aid, but<br />\ndon't ask for it...whether because<br />\nof pride or a recent accident...the<br />\noffice is here to help the<br />\n<br />\nstudents,\" he commented.<br />\nHood has had seven years<br />\nexperience in college financial aid<br />\noffices. A holder of a bachelor's<br />\ndegree from Bloomfield College<br />\nin Bloomfield, New Jersey, he<br />\nwas the fihancial aid director at<br />\nhis alma mater, and then the<br />\nassistant director of financial aid<br />\nat Newark State College, Union,<br />\nNew Jersey before arriving at<br />\nUMBC as director two years ago.<br />\nHe received a master's degree in<br />\neducation and student service at<br />\nNew York University.<br />\nThe new director received<br />\nfinancial aids while he was a<br />\nstudent at Bloomfield. Asked if<br />\nhis receiving of financial aid<br />\nwould weigh in his manner of<br />\ndispensing financial aid he<br />\nreplied. \"I'm going to reflect<br />\nupon the graduate school courses<br />\nI have had, the philosophy of<br />\nfinancial aid and the various<br />\nagencies offering financial aid to<br />\nstudents,on the federal, state and<br />\nlocal levels.<br />\nBut Hood pointed out that his<br />\nnumber one priority would be in<br />\nbeing able to find funds for the<br />\nstudent. \"When you talk about<br />\nmoney you're talking about<br />\nmany of the students' problems,\"<br />\nhe stated.<br />\n<br />\nDennis Perman and Mitch rlarvit at last Saturday's Flying Monkey.<br />\n<br />\nHe pointed out that Hopkins,<br />\nwhich is one of the most<br />\nexpensive schools for a student<br />\nto attend (it costs approximately<br />\n$5,300 to attend Hopkins for a<br />\nyear. This includes tuition, living<br />\nexpenses, books, transportation,<br />\nand other items of school living),<br />\nhas been instituting a program by<br />\nwhich the college gives out the<br />\nfinancial aid loan to the student<br />\ninstead of the student going to<br />\nthe bank. \"Hopkins has borrowed<br />\nmoney to loan to the students.\"<br />\nWith the decrease in federal<br />\nfinancial aid to college students<br />\nmost colleges were not told how<br />\nmuch they would receive from<br />\nthe government for the<br />\n1973-1974 year until mid-June<br />\nof this year. As Hood explained,<br />\n\"we didn't know how much we<br />\nwould be getting until<br />\nJune...(Hopkins) went 'out on a<br />\nlimb'...in May...and set out their<br />\nfinancial awards.\" The University<br />\ngot their full request from the<br />\ngovernment.<br />\n\"There are a host of factors in<br />\nmaking financial aid awards...It<br />\ntakes a full forty hours a week<br />\nfor the job,\" Hood said. And as<br />\nthe new director plainly put it,<br />\n\"you knew the job was tough<br />\nwhen you took it.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-letter/october 2, 1973<br />\n<br />\ncampus notes<br />\nSEMINARS<br />\nOn the first Thursday of the<br />\nmonth Professor Carl Christ,<br />\nDepartment of Pol.

Eisenhower Symposium begins<br />\ntomorrow and in the opening address, members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity will hear from one of the nation's most creative<br />\nthinkers, R. Buckminster Fuller. As indicated in his press kit,<br />\ncomplete with graphs showing the number of speeches he has<br />\ngiven and times his name has been referred to in print, Fuller is<br />\na very famous man, and therein lies his attraction and also his<br />\nlimitation as the keynoter of the lecture series.<br />\nNo doubt his speech will be entertaining and possibly even<br />\nenlightening, but there will also certainly be a large dose of R.<br />\nBuckminster Fuller as an \"event\" mixed in with his appearance<br />\nin Shriver Hall.<br />\nStarting off the lecture series with a star is probably a good<br />\nidea from the show-business standpoint, since it opens the event<br />\non a strongly favorable note \u2014 but this practice also belies the<br />\nessential flaw in conception the six symposia put on since 1967<br />\nhave all shown. Every one so far produced has scheduled a series<br />\nof nine to twelve individual events in the fall, usually one<br />\nspeaker talking for forty minutes and answering questions amide<br />\nlonger, or perhaps a panel discussion featuring several experts in<br />\na given field, but the events in general fit together so poorly<br />\nthat one is left, at the end of the symposium with little more<br />\nthan a memory of having seen and heard ten or so famous men.<br />\nThe MSE Symposium, as currently designed, asks a man to<br />\ndo the impossible \u2014 to explain his idea of some abstruse subject<br />\nin forty minutes, answer questions and leave something<br />\nworthwhile with his audience. Many earlier symposium speakers<br />\nhave delivered their standard lecture circuit speech without<br />\nbothering to consider the topic on which they were to speak.<br />\nInstead of the current set-up, the Symposium leaders should.<br />\nconsider changing the format from one in which several people<br />\nspeak once, to one in which one person speaks several times. To<br />\nbe sure, the speaker would have to be one of extraordinary<br />\ndistinction to succeed in such a forum, but such a Speaker<br />\nwould add far more to the Hopkins educational experience than<br />\ncould a dozen people whose chief distinction is that they were<br />\npersuaded to come.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\n,'<br />\nBIA leaders called \"morons<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAfter an encounter with the<br />\nBoard of Intramural Athletics,<br />\nBIA, I have come to the conclusion<br />\nthat the Board is being run<br />\nincompetently by a group of<br />\n\"omnipotent\" morons. Beside the<br />\nfact that knowledge about<br />\nparticular sports, or for the matter<br />\nsports in general, is not a necessary<br />\ntetion. iot membetship on the<br />\n<br />\nis most unfair to the other<br />\nfraternities who are not<br />\nrepresented equally and to the<br />\nindependent teams who are hardly<br />\nrepresented at all.<br />\nI would like to see the make-up<br />\nof the Board changed to a more<br />\nequally representative body. This<br />\ncould be achieved only by a new<br />\nselection process. Each fraternity<br />\nwould select one<br />\n_ member_ from<br />\n<br />\nwould be balanced by an equal<br />\nremain unreceptive to<br />\nnumber of \"at large\" members<br />\nknowledgable outside participation<br />\nchosen by an interview system,<br />\nand suggestions.<br />\n<br />\nThe members of the Board who<br />\nrun the specific events are chosen<br />\nnot by qualifications or knowledge<br />\nabout the sport, but, to the best of<br />\nmy knowledge, by the individual<br />\nhimself on a first come first serve<br />\nbasis. Thus, the most qualified<br />\nmember does not necessarily run<br />\nfootball, basketball, lacrosse, etc.<br />\nThere seems to be a lack of<br />\nefficiency and organizational skill<br />\nin this type of system.<br />\nI would like at this time to<br />\napologize to the too few able<br />\nmembers of the Board who are<br />\nassets to the workings and<br />\noperation of the BIA.<br />\nI would also like to propose<br />\ncertain suggestions and possible<br />\nchanges in the makeup and<br />\nselection of Board members.<br />\nPresently, the Board is composed<br />\nprimarily of members from two<br />\nfraternities, Sig Ep and TEP. This<br />\n<br />\nsome<br />\nsimilar to the one<br />\npresently in use by the BIA.<br />\nIf this system were employed<br />\ninstead of the arbitrary one in<br />\ncurrent use the Board would be<br />\nmade up of a more qualified<br />\ncaliber of individuals equally<br />\nrepresenting all interests involved<br />\nin the intramural program.<br />\nMembers would not be so<br />\nfraternity oriented and no<br />\nfraternity(s) could monopolize and<br />\nmanipulate Board decision making<br />\nand policies.<br />\nThe Board must be forceful and<br />\nauthoritative in its decisions and<br />\nmust abide by the BIA rules at all<br />\ntimes.

It is very clear that the staff<br />\nwriter and the News\u2014Letter<br />\neditors made absolutely no<br />\nattempt to find out the viewpoints<br />\nof the fraternity members. It seems<br />\nthat the staff writer and the editor<br />\nfelt that they could make an<br />\nobjective analysis of the situation<br />\nby only consulting the neighbors.<br />\nThe result of this, was a very much<br />\nslanted and incomplete description<br />\nof the situation which now exists<br />\n'on Canterbury Road.<br />\nIn the article concerning the<br />\n\"northern frats,\" several errors<br />\nwere made. First, it was stated that<br />\nfirecrackers were set off last week,<br />\nwhich is not true. Several fireworks<br />\nwere set off during the first week<br />\nof school, but after getting a few<br />\ncomplaints from the neighbors,<br />\nnone have subsequently<br />\nbeen<br />\nset off. Secondly, it was stated that<br />\nseveral car aerials have been<br />\nbroken. One car aerial was broken<br />\nabout two weeks ago. Although<br />\nthe owner, (whom we spoke to<br />\nwhen he reported the damage)<br />\ndoes not know if the culprit was a<br />\nfraternity member, which we<br />\n<br />\nsincerely doubt, the Betas have<br />\nvolunteered to pay for the aerial as<br />\nan act of good faith.<br />\nIt would be a mistake to pretend<br />\nthat Beta is as unchanged as some<br />\nof the News\u2014Letter literati would<br />\nmake us out to be. Many of our<br />\n\"traditions\" are still observed, and<br />\nin part, our attitude of, \"no one<br />\nhas control over me\" still holds<br />\ntrue.<br />\nNow, even though we are<br />\nmaking an effort to improve<br />\nrelations with the neighbors, (we<br />\nplan an open house for this<br />\nSunday,) some seem more<br />\ndetermined than ever to get rid of<br />\n<br />\nBy ROSS JONES<br />\nWhenever anyone asks me<br />\nwhether Johns Hopkins has<br />\nchanged during the period I have<br />\nknown it, my answer always is<br />\n\"Yes, of course,\" followed quickly<br />\nby \"But not as much as you might<br />\nhave guessed.\"<br />\nI first became acquainted with<br />\nHomewood in the fall of 1948<br />\nwhen I arrived for an interview in<br />\nthe Admissions Office, then on the<br />\nsecond floor of Remsen Hall. I<br />\nrecall being impressed by several<br />\nthings:<br />\nThe Admissions officer<br />\nemphasized the fact that Hopkins<br />\nwas a University, not a college and<br />\nthat students therefore are<br />\naccepted and treated as mature<br />\npersons and were left more or less<br />\non their own. Help of any sort<br />\nwould be available, but it would be<br />\nup to me to ask for it. The beauty<br />\nof the campus was exceptionally<br />\nattractive as was the small, private<br />\nnature of Johns. Hopkins. And,<br />\nperhaps. not at least, I was<br />\ndelighted with the warm and<br />\nfriendly atmosphere of the<br />\nHopkins Club where we had lunch<br />\nthat day.<br />\nAs I look at undergraduate life<br />\ntoday, it seems that these<br />\ncharacteristics still prevail and so,<br />\nin a fundamental way for me at<br />\nleast, Hopkins has not changed.<br />\nBut of course it really has.<br />\nThe quality of student life has<br />\nimproved greatly. Many more staff<br />\npersons are working on various<br />\nactivities designed to make life<br />\nhere more enjoyable and<br />\nrewarding. Physical facilities are<br />\nvastly larger.

Nearly all<br />\nof them had spent their entire<br />\nadult lives at Johns Hopkins, from<br />\ntheir undergraduate days through<br />\ntheir doctoral degrees and then as<br />\nprofessors and administrators. This<br />\nwas true of department chairmen,<br />\ndeans, controllers, treasurers, vice<br />\npresidents and so forth. Suddenly,<br />\nduring the mid-1960's nearly all of<br />\nthem reached retirement age and<br />\nthere was rapid turnover in many<br />\nkey positions.<br />\nIn many cases their successors<br />\nwere \"outsiders\" or persons who<br />\nassumed administrative leadership<br />\nafter long tenure here but<br />\noriginally came from another<br />\ninstitution. This adjustment<br />\nundoubtedly has been a healthy<br />\none since newcomers bring with<br />\nthem new ideas and fresh<br />\nperspectives on issues facing Johns<br />\nHopkins. But this sudden turnover<br />\nprovided a definite jolt to the<br />\nUniversity's style of operations<br />\nwhich has had a basic effect on the<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nIn summary, Hopkins surely has<br />\nchanged and if it is to continue to<br />\nremain one of the nation's leading<br />\nuniversities, it must continue to do<br />\nso. But the fundamental nature of<br />\nthe University, with its small size,<br />\nits excellent faculty who are<br />\ndedicated to teaching and research,<br />\nand its socially and intellectually<br />\nmature students, has persisted<br />\nduring the time I have known it.

Auden's poetry<br />\nBy B.H. COHEN<br />\nOne Sunday last year, in the<br />\nRembrandt room of the National<br />\nGallery, I heard two middle-aged<br />\nwomen dismiss the artist for,what<br />\nmarked.<br />\nI thought of this yesterday,<br />\nwhen I read that W.H. Auden had<br />\ndied in Vienna over the weekend.<br />\nHis famous.\"Muse de Beaux Arts\"<br />\nbegins:<br />\nAbout suffering they were never<br />\nwrong,<br />\nThe Old Masters: how well they<br />\nunderstood<br />\nIts human position;...<br />\n<br />\nThe poem, a meditation in which<br />\nBrueghel's Icarus is cited (in John<br />\nDixon Hunt's words) to \"support a<br />\nmoral vision,\" ends:<br />\nthe sun shone<br />\nAs it had to on the white legs<br />\ndisappearing into the green<br />\nWater; and the expensive delicate<br />\nship that must have seen<br />\nSomething amazing, a boy falling<br />\nout of the sky,<br />\nHad somewhere to get to and sailed<br />\ncalmly on.<br />\n<br />\nNor does the colloquial flavor<br />\ndeny Auden's poetry the impersonality and slf.confidence of a<br />\nmaster; but these same characteristics have been seen as solipSism<br />\nand smugness. In a much-reprinted<br />\nAtlantic essay (1953), Stephen<br />\nSpender, Wl-to was a friend of sorts<br />\nduring theirs undergraduate days at<br />\nOxford, faulted Auden for lack of<br />\na \"unified personality,\" and<br />\nclaimed that his late conversion to<br />\n<br />\nProtestantism (from a rather loose<br />\nFreudianism), whatever else it did,<br />\nallowed him to anchor his poetry<br />\nto \"some objective authority.\"<br />\n\"What strikes me more and<br />\nL.unimentaiy, iuutialteS, appendixes \u2014 observations surrounding<br />\nthe history of his time, more brilliant, dazzling, and amusing pet-<br />\n<br />\nprescribe some sort of moral cure:<br />\nthese run through much of the<br />\npoetry.

The<br />\nfaculty always has been<br />\ndetermined to remain relatively<br />\nsmall, independent and devoted to<br />\nyoung people who genuinely wish<br />\nto take advantage of the<br />\nscholarship available to them here.<br />\nOne of the most profound<br />\nchanges still is evolving and will<br />\ncontinue to do so. Here I refer to<br />\nco-education at the undergraduate<br />\nlevel.

As an undergraduate I<br />\nmay have seen the President(from<br />\nafar) two or three times \u2014 in four<br />\nyears!

Wayne Hood,the<br />\nnew head of financial aid for<br />\nHopkins, officially started his<br />\nnew job here yesterday.<br />\nHood, who for the past two<br />\nyears has been the financial aid<br />\ndirector at UMBC;said that he<br />\nwas \"anxious to begin\" his new<br />\nwork.<br />\nAs the new financial aid chief,<br />\nhe said he hopes to change the<br />\nimage of the Financial Aid office<br />\nto that of a more affable and<br />\n\"efficient\" unit. Among the<br />\nchanges he is now working on is<br />\nthe designing of a new pamphlet<br />\non financial aid as well as a new<br />\nfinancial aid application form.<br />\nHe also stressed that he would<br />\ninitiate an improved \"public<br />\nrelations\" program with the<br />\nstudent to make \"work a little<br />\neasier for the students and<br />\nuniversity itself.\"<br />\nHood felt that the \"personal<br />\nelement\" should be understood<br />\nwhen receiving financial aid. \"A<br />\nlot of students for one reason or<br />\nanother need financial aid, but<br />\ndon't ask for it...whether because<br />\nof pride or a recent accident...the<br />\noffice is here to help the<br /><br />\nstudents,\" he commented.<br />\nHood has had seven years<br />\nexperience in college financial aid<br />\noffices. A holder of a bachelor's<br />\ndegree from Bloomfield College<br />\nin Bloomfield, New Jersey, he<br />\nwas the fihancial aid director at<br />\nhis alma mater, and then the<br />\nassistant director of financial aid<br />\nat Newark State College, Union,<br />\nNew Jersey before arriving at<br />\nUMBC as director two years ago.<br />\nHe received a master's degree in<br />\neducation and student service at<br />\nNew York University.<br />\nThe new director received<br />\nfinancial aids while he was a<br />\nstudent at Bloomfield. Asked if<br />\nhis receiving of financial aid<br />\nwould weigh in his manner of<br />\ndispensing financial aid he<br />\nreplied. \"I'm going to reflect<br />\nupon the graduate school courses<br />\nI have had, the philosophy of<br />\nfinancial aid and the various<br />\nagencies offering financial aid to<br />\nstudents,on the federal, state and<br />\nlocal levels.<br />\nBut Hood pointed out that his<br />\nnumber one priority would be in<br />\nbeing able to find funds for the<br />\nstudent. \"When you talk about<br />\nmoney you're talking about<br />\nmany of the students' problems,\"<br />\nhe stated.<br /><br />\nDennis Perman and Mitch rlarvit at last Saturday's Flying Monkey.<br /><br />\nHe pointed out that Hopkins,<br />\nwhich is one of the most<br />\nexpensive schools for a student<br />\nto attend (it costs approximately<br />\n$5,300 to attend Hopkins for a<br />\nyear. This includes tuition, living<br />\nexpenses, books, transportation,<br />\nand other items of school living),<br />\nhas been instituting a program by<br />\nwhich the college gives out the<br />\nfinancial aid loan to the student<br />\ninstead of the student going to<br />\nthe bank. \"Hopkins has borrowed<br />\nmoney to loan to the students.\"<br />\nWith the decrease in federal<br />\nfinancial aid to college students<br />\nmost colleges were not told how<br />\nmuch they would receive from<br />\nthe government for the<br />\n1973-1974 year until mid-June<br />\nof this year. As Hood explained,<br />\n\"we didn't know how much we<br />\nwould be getting until<br />\nJune...(Hopkins) went 'out on a<br />\nlimb'...in May...and set out their<br />\nfinancial awards.\" The University<br />\ngot their full request from the<br />\ngovernment.<br />\n\"There are a host of factors in<br />\nmaking financial aid awards...It<br />\ntakes a full forty hours a week<br />\nfor the job,\" Hood said.

Eisenhower Symposium begins<br />\ntomorrow and in the opening address, members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity will hear from one of the nation's most creative<br />\nthinkers, R. Buckminster Fuller. As indicated in his press kit,<br />\ncomplete with graphs showing the number of speeches he has<br />\ngiven and times his name has been referred to in print, Fuller is<br />\na very famous man, and therein lies his attraction and also his<br />\nlimitation as the keynoter of the lecture series.<br />\nNo doubt his speech will be entertaining and possibly even<br />\nenlightening, but there will also certainly be a large dose of R.<br />\nBuckminster Fuller as an \"event\" mixed in with his appearance<br />\nin Shriver Hall.<br />\nStarting off the lecture series with a star is probably a good<br />\nidea from the show-business standpoint, since it opens the event<br />\non a strongly favorable note \u2014 but this practice also belies the<br />\nessential flaw in conception the six symposia put on since 1967<br />\nhave all shown. Every one so far produced has scheduled a series<br />\nof nine to twelve individual events in the fall, usually one<br />\nspeaker talking for forty minutes and answering questions amide<br />\nlonger, or perhaps a panel discussion featuring several experts in<br />\na given field, but the events in general fit together so poorly<br />\nthat one is left, at the end of the symposium with little more<br />\nthan a memory of having seen and heard ten or so famous men.<br />\nThe MSE Symposium, as currently designed, asks a man to<br />\ndo the impossible \u2014 to explain his idea of some abstruse subject<br />\nin forty minutes, answer questions and leave something<br />\nworthwhile with his audience. Many earlier symposium speakers<br />\nhave delivered their standard lecture circuit speech without<br />\nbothering to consider the topic on which they were to speak.<br />\nInstead of the current set-up, the Symposium leaders should.<br />\nconsider changing the format from one in which several people<br />\nspeak once, to one in which one person speaks several times. To<br />\nbe sure, the speaker would have to be one of extraordinary<br />\ndistinction to succeed in such a forum, but such a Speaker<br />\nwould add far more to the Hopkins educational experience than<br />\ncould a dozen people whose chief distinction is that they were<br />\npersuaded to come.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\n,'<br />\nBIA leaders called \"morons<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAfter an encounter with the<br />\nBoard of Intramural Athletics,<br />\nBIA, I have come to the conclusion<br />\nthat the Board is being run<br />\nincompetently by a group of<br />\n\"omnipotent\" morons. Beside the<br />\nfact that knowledge about<br />\nparticular sports, or for the matter<br />\nsports in general, is not a necessary<br />\ntetion. iot membetship on the<br /><br />\nis most unfair to the other<br />\nfraternities who are not<br />\nrepresented equally and to the<br />\nindependent teams who are hardly<br />\nrepresented at all.<br />\nI would like to see the make-up<br />\nof the Board changed to a more<br />\nequally representative body. This<br />\ncould be achieved only by a new<br />\nselection process. Each fraternity<br />\nwould select one<br />\n_ member_ from<br /><br />\nwould be balanced by an equal<br />\nremain unreceptive to<br />\nnumber of \"at large\" members<br />\nknowledgable outside participation<br />\nchosen by an interview system,<br />\nand suggestions.<br /><br />\nThe members of the Board who<br />\nrun the specific events are chosen<br />\nnot by qualifications or knowledge<br />\nabout the sport, but, to the best of<br />\nmy knowledge, by the individual<br />\nhimself on a first come first serve<br />\nbasis. Thus, the most qualified<br />\nmember does not necessarily run<br />\nfootball, basketball, lacrosse, etc.<br />\nThere seems to be a lack of<br />\nefficiency and organizational skill<br />\nin this type of system.<br />\nI would like at this time to<br />\napologize to the too few able<br />\nmembers of the Board who are<br />\nassets to the workings and<br />\noperation of the BIA.<br />\nI would also like to propose<br />\ncertain suggestions and possible<br />\nchanges in the makeup and<br />\nselection of Board members.<br />\nPresently, the Board is composed<br />\nprimarily of members from two<br />\nfraternities, Sig Ep and TEP. This<br /><br />\nsome<br />\nsimilar to the one<br />\npresently in use by the BIA.<br />\nIf this system were employed<br />\ninstead of the arbitrary one in<br />\ncurrent use the Board would be<br />\nmade up of a more qualified<br />\ncaliber of individuals equally<br />\nrepresenting all interests involved<br />\nin the intramural program.<br />\nMembers would not be so<br />\nfraternity oriented and no<br />\nfraternity(s) could monopolize and<br />\nmanipulate Board decision making<br />\nand policies.<br />\nThe Board must be forceful and<br />\nauthoritative in its decisions and<br />\nmust abide by the BIA rules at all<br />\ntimes. Broken precedents can often<br />\ncome back to haunt you at a later<br />\ndate.

It is very clear that the staff<br />\nwriter and the News\u2014Letter<br />\neditors made absolutely no<br />\nattempt to find out the viewpoints<br />\nof the fraternity members. It seems<br />\nthat the staff writer and the editor<br />\nfelt that they could make an<br />\nobjective analysis of the situation<br />\nby only consulting the neighbors.<br />\nThe result of this, was a very much<br />\nslanted and incomplete description<br />\nof the situation which now exists<br />\n'on Canterbury Road.<br />\nIn the article concerning the<br />\n\"northern frats,\" several errors<br />\nwere made. First, it was stated that<br />\nfirecrackers were set off last week,<br />\nwhich is not true. Several fireworks<br />\nwere set off during the first week<br />\nof school, but after getting a few<br />\ncomplaints from the neighbors,<br />\nnone have subsequently<br />\nbeen<br />\nset off. Secondly, it was stated that<br />\nseveral car aerials have been<br />\nbroken. One car aerial was broken<br />\nabout two weeks ago. Although<br />\nthe owner, (whom we spoke to<br />\nwhen he reported the damage)<br />\ndoes not know if the culprit was a<br />\nfraternity member, which we<br /><br />\nsincerely doubt, the Betas have<br />\nvolunteered to pay for the aerial as<br />\nan act of good faith.<br />\nIt would be a mistake to pretend<br />\nthat Beta is as unchanged as some<br />\nof the News\u2014Letter literati would<br />\nmake us out to be. Many of our<br />\n\"traditions\" are still observed, and<br />\nin part, our attitude of, \"no one<br />\nhas control over me\" still holds<br />\ntrue.<br />\nNow, even though we are<br />\nmaking an effort to improve<br />\nrelations with the neighbors, (we<br />\nplan an open house for this<br />\nSunday,) some seem more<br />\ndetermined than ever to get rid of<br /><br />\nBy ROSS JONES<br />\nWhenever anyone asks me<br />\nwhether Johns Hopkins has<br />\nchanged during the period I have<br />\nknown it, my answer always is<br />\n\"Yes, of course,\" followed quickly<br />\nby \"But not as much as you might<br />\nhave guessed.\"<br />\nI first became acquainted with<br />\nHomewood in the fall of 1948<br />\nwhen I arrived for an interview in<br />\nthe Admissions Office, then on the<br />\nsecond floor of Remsen Hall. I<br />\nrecall being impressed by several<br />\nthings:<br />\nThe Admissions officer<br />\nemphasized the fact that Hopkins<br />\nwas a University, not a college and<br />\nthat students therefore are<br />\naccepted and treated as mature<br />\npersons and were left more or less<br />\non their own. Help of any sort<br />\nwould be available, but it would be<br />\nup to me to ask for it. The beauty<br />\nof the campus was exceptionally<br />\nattractive as was the small, private<br />\nnature of Johns. Hopkins. And,<br />\nperhaps. not at least, I was<br />\ndelighted with the warm and<br />\nfriendly atmosphere of the<br />\nHopkins Club where we had lunch<br />\nthat day.<br />\nAs I look at undergraduate life<br />\ntoday, it seems that these<br />\ncharacteristics still prevail and so,<br />\nin a fundamental way for me at<br />\nleast, Hopkins has not changed.<br />\nBut of course it really has.<br />\nThe quality of student life has<br />\nimproved greatly. Many more staff<br />\npersons are working on various<br />\nactivities designed to make life<br />\nhere more enjoyable and<br />\nrewarding. Physical facilities are<br />\nvastly larger. Shriver, Shaffer,<br />\nBarton, Ames, Macaulay, Dunning<br />\nand the fairly recent addition to<br />\nRowland are all new since I was a<br />\nstudent. So are Nichols House, the<br />\n\"new\" dormitory, three apartment<br /><br />\nRoss Jones, in<br />\nhouses and the Athletic Center.<br />\nAthletic facilities and programs<br />\nhave made a quantum jump<br />\nforward since 1949-53.<br />\nWithout Shriver Hall and<br />\nwithout staff to plan and carry out<br />\nspecial events programs, we had<br />\nalmost no outside speakers on<br /><br />\nmodod<br />\npensive<br />\npep<br />\nnusis. An<br />\nacam<br />\nwhile Levering has<br />\nalvays been a student center of<br />\nsorts, the new Union will be<br />\ninfinitely better for that purpose.<br />\nWhile I am not fully competent<br />\nto analyze significant changes<br />\nwhich may have occurred in the<br />\nfaculty over the years, my<br /><br />\nstudent here and when I returned<br />\nin 1961, those who comprised the<br />\nUniversity's academic and<br />\nadministrative leadership had a<br />\ncommon denomirrator. Nearly all<br />\nof them had spent their entire<br />\nadult lives at Johns Hopkins, from<br />\ntheir undergraduate days through<br />\ntheir doctoral degrees and then as<br />\nprofessors and administrators. This<br />\nwas true of department chairmen,<br />\ndeans, controllers, treasurers, vice<br />\npresidents and so forth. Suddenly,<br />\nduring the mid-1960's nearly all of<br />\nthem reached retirement age and<br />\nthere was rapid turnover in many<br />\nkey positions.<br />\nIn many cases their successors<br />\nwere \"outsiders\" or persons who<br />\nassumed administrative leadership<br />\nafter long tenure here but<br />\noriginally came from another<br />\ninstitution. This adjustment<br />\nundoubtedly has been a healthy<br />\none since newcomers bring with<br />\nthem new ideas and fresh<br />\nperspectives on issues facing Johns<br />\nHopkins. But this sudden turnover<br />\nprovided a definite jolt to the<br />\nUniversity's style of operations<br />\nwhich has had a basic effect on the<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nIn summary, Hopkins surely has<br />\nchanged and if it is to continue to<br />\nremain one of the nation's leading<br />\nuniversities, it must continue to do<br />\nso. But the fundamental nature of<br />\nthe University, with its small size,<br />\nits excellent faculty who are<br />\ndedicated to teaching and research,<br />\nand its socially and intellectually<br />\nmature students, has persisted<br />\nduring the time I have known it.

COHEN<br />\nOne Sunday last year, in the<br />\nRembrandt room of the National<br />\nGallery, I heard two middle-aged<br />\nwomen dismiss the artist for,what<br />\nmarked.<br />\nI thought of this yesterday,<br />\nwhen I read that W.H. Auden had<br />\ndied in Vienna over the weekend.<br />\nHis famous.\"Muse de Beaux Arts\"<br />\nbegins:<br />\nAbout suffering they were never<br />\nwrong,<br />\nThe Old Masters: how well they<br />\nunderstood<br />\nIts human position;...<br /><br />\nThe poem, a meditation in which<br />\nBrueghel's Icarus is cited (in John<br />\nDixon Hunt's words) to \"support a<br />\nmoral vision,\" ends:<br />\nthe sun shone<br />\nAs it had to on the white legs<br />\ndisappearing into the green<br />\nWater; and the expensive delicate<br />\nship that must have seen<br />\nSomething amazing, a boy falling<br />\nout of the sky,<br />\nHad somewhere to get to and sailed<br />\ncalmly on.<br /><br />\nNor does the colloquial flavor<br />\ndeny Auden's poetry the impersonality and slf.confidence of a<br />\nmaster; but these same characteristics have been seen as solipSism<br />\nand smugness. In a much-reprinted<br />\nAtlantic essay (1953), Stephen<br />\nSpender, Wl-to was a friend of sorts<br />\nduring theirs undergraduate days at<br />\nOxford, faulted Auden for lack of<br />\na \"unified personality,\" and<br />\nclaimed that his late conversion to<br /><br />\nProtestantism (from a rather loose<br />\nFreudianism), whatever else it did,<br />\nallowed him to anchor his poetry<br />\nto \"some objective authority.\"<br />\n\"What strikes me more and<br />\nL.unimentaiy, iuutialteS, appendixes \u2014 observations surrounding<br />\nthe history of his time, more brilliant, dazzling, and amusing pet-<br /><br />\nprescribe some sort of moral cure:<br />\nthese run through much of the<br />\npoetry.

Carr<br />\nand the Betas<br /><br />\nimpression is that the faculty has<br />\nremained exceptionally strong<br />\nthroughout the period.<br />\nAppointments and promotions are<br />\nmade, and were made then, under<br />\na rigorous process which strives to<br />\ninsure a continuity of quality. The<br />\nfaculty always has been<br />\ndetermined to remain relatively<br />\nsmall, independent and devoted to<br />\nyoung people who genuinely wish<br />\nto take advantage of the<br />\nscholarship available to them here.<br />\nOne of the most profound<br />\nchanges still is evolving and will<br />\ncontinue to do so. Here I refer to<br />\nco-education at the undergraduate<br />\nlevel. While this was accomplished<br />\na few years ago with none of the<br />\nhoopla which accompanied similar<br />\nchanges at Yale and Princeton, I<br />\ncannot help but believe it will have<br />\ngreater impact on student life,<br />\nportions of the academic program<br />\nand alumni activities than any<br />\nother single change at the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nAnother change which<br />\nstrengthens 'the University is the<br />\ngreater interaction among students,<br />\nfaculty and administrators and<br />\namong the various divisions of the<br />\nUniversity. As an undergraduate I<br />\nmay have seen the President(from<br />\nafar) two or three times \u2014 in four<br />\nyears! Students never thought of<br />\nserving on faculty or administrative<br />\ncommittees, let alone meet with<br />\nTrustees. Until fairly recently the<br />\nseparation among campuses at<br />\nHomewood, East Baltimore and<br />\nWashington was almost absolute.<br />\nToday I sense much closer<br />\ninvolvement across the old<br />\nboundaries with some progress still<br />\nto be made.<br />\nFinally, I should point out what<br />\nis perhaps a \u2022 more subtle<br />\nadjustment in the development of<br />\nthe University.

Had the<br />\nHopkins soccer team remained in<br />\nbed through the early morning<br />\nhours and dreamed of recent<br />\ncontests with the Tigers, they<br />\nwould have known how the<br />\ncoming game would end.<br />\nThe game was worse than the<br />\n2-0 Hopkins defeat it turned out<br />\nto be. It was a reincarnation of<br />\nthe past two seasons in which the<br />\nTigers defeated the Jays.<br />\nThis defeat would not affect<br />\nthe Bluejay booters so much if<br />\nonly they had been beaten by a<br />\nbetter team. In Saturday's game,<br />\nas in the past, the Bluejays<br />\noutplayed the Tigers to the<br />\nextent of controlling the ball for<br />\nwell over the majority of the<br />\n90-minute game and shooting the<br />\nball twice as often as their<br />\nopponents. The sloppy offensive<br />\nplays of the Tigers were<br />\nconstantly thwarted by the alert<br />\nHopkins defense. Standing out in<br />\nSaturday's game was the only<br />\njunior on the Hopkins team,<br />\n;ladle Gilman, who played an<br /><br />\nexcellent defensive game<br />\nstopping a number of Tiger<br />\noffensive drives.<br />\nWith a first-half Hopkins goal<br />\nrevoked due to an impossible<br />\npenalty called by one of the<br />\nreferees, the Jays' morale took a<br />\nstep downward.<br />\nWith no score at halftime, the<br />\nJays wondered when their<br />\noffensive attacks would produce<br />\ngoals. But when a broken Tiger<br />\noffensive play resulted in a goal,<br />\nall minds recalled the past two<br />\nseasons and the spirits of the<br />\nteam dropped yet another step.<br /><br />\nAs the Jays continued in this<br />\nseemingly predetermined game,<br />\ntheir hopes were shot down by<br />\nstill another Tiger score which<br />\ncame on one of the few offensive<br />\nattacks that got by the Hopkins<br />\ndefense. With fifteen minutes still<br />\nleft in the game, it was obvious<br />\nthat the \"mind over matter\"<br />\ntheory prevailed. The Jays<br />\ncouldn't buy a goal. At the final<br />\ngun, the score was 2-0 with the<br />\npast repeating itself once again.<br />\nTomorrow the Jays will try to<br />\neven their record as they play<br />\nhost to University of Delaware at<br />\n3:00 p.m. at the Homewood<br />\nsoccer field.<br />\n111\u202211<br /><br />\n11111111111<br /><br />\ndetermined first half effort had<br />\nthe Diplomats handcuffed on<br />\noffense.
