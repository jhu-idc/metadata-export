Undergraduates and alumni, in increasing numbers, have found the Civil Engineering Hall a<br />\npleasant rendezvous where a few hours may be spent in a strictly<br />\nHopkins atmosphere with Hopkins spirit abounding.<br />\nCoincident with this rise in popularity, however, appears an element\u2014a group of outsiders\u2014which, if it cannot be termed undesirable, is certainly, alien to Hopkins spirit and Hopkins traditions.<br />\nThese individuals, regular patrons of dov9n-town tea-rooms and<br />\ndance floors, have found the nominal fee charged at Homewood attractive and have condescended to place the C. E. Hall on their<br />\nweekly calling list. In increasing numbers they are deserting their<br />\nformer haunts and the C. E. Hall is tending to become a public<br />\nrather than a Hopkins dance floor.<br />\nIf this tendency grows Hopkins men will soon find other places<br />\ntake<br />\ntheir girls on Saturday afternoon. It does not seem necesto<br />\nsary to entirely exclude outsiders.

Hopkins was known for its excellent graduate<br />\nschools, but the nation was not aware of the fact that undergraduate activities existed.<br />\nIn recent years, however, there has been a marked change. No<br />\nmore is Johns Hopkins known only as a hospital. Its athletic teams<br />\nhave brought undergraduate activities before the nation's eyes, its<br />\nGlee Club, its publications and other student activities have helped<br />\nto advertise the University. The same high standards of scholarship have been maintained; activities have made rapid strides in<br />\nthe right direction.<br />\nThere is still, however, plenty of room for advertisement.

Undergraduates and alumni, in increasing numbers, have found the Civil Engineering Hall a<br />\npleasant rendezvous where a few hours may be spent in a strictly<br />\nHopkins atmosphere with Hopkins spirit abounding.<br />\nCoincident with this rise in popularity, however, appears an element\u2014a group of outsiders\u2014which, if it cannot be termed undesirable, is certainly, alien to Hopkins spirit and Hopkins traditions.<br />\nThese individuals, regular patrons of dov9n-town tea-rooms and<br />\ndance floors, have found the nominal fee charged at Homewood attractive and have condescended to place the C. E. Hall on their<br />\nweekly calling list. In increasing numbers they are deserting their<br />\nformer haunts and the C. E. Hall is tending to become a public<br />\nrather than a Hopkins dance floor.<br />\nIf this tendency grows Hopkins men will soon find other places<br />\ntake<br />\ntheir girls on Saturday afternoon.

Hopkins was known for its excellent graduate<br />\nschools, but the nation was not aware of the fact that undergraduate activities existed.<br />\nIn recent years, however, there has been a marked change. No<br />\nmore is Johns Hopkins known only as a hospital. Its athletic teams<br />\nhave brought undergraduate activities before the nation's eyes, its<br />\nGlee Club, its publications and other student activities have helped<br />\nto advertise the University. The same high standards of scholarship have been maintained; activities have made rapid strides in<br />\nthe right direction.<br />\nThere is still, however, plenty of room for advertisement.
