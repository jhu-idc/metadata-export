B. L. GILDERSLEEVE<br />\n<br />\nThe passing of a scholar who<br />\nfor much more than 30 years was<br />\na fellow-worker in the same field<br />\nof study, in the same university,<br />\nis a unique experience even to one<br />\nto whom a long life ought to have<br />\nbrought what has been called \"a<br />\nweather-beaten hardihood of soul.\"<br />\nThere is no parallel in my academic history of nearly 60 years.<br />\nand I wish that it were in my power to do justice to my own sense<br />\nof loss as well as to the merits of<br />\nthe lamented teacher, who has<br />\njust closed the account of a long<br />\nand memorable servfce.

Taylor Speaks on%Food Problem.<br />\nPresident Goodnow Reviews Events of Past Year.<br />\nDegrees Conferred Upon Men in Service.<br />\nThe first Commemoration Day of war times was celebrated in<br />\nthe<br />\nassembly hall of historic McCoy Hall,amid a distinctly military setting<br />\non the morning of Friday, February 22. Despite a snow storm,the Hopkins Battalion marched from Homewood to the old site of the University on Monument street, near Eutaw, and formed a guard of honor<br />\nalong the corridors of McCoy Hall through which the solemn academic<br />\nprocession passed. Many members of the faculty, who were wont<br />\nto<br />\nappear in the traditional academic robes, wore the khaki service uniform of the United States Army. The great majority of the alumni,<br />\nthat attended the exercises wore the uniform of the armed service.<br />\nThe invocation was delivered by Rev. Dr. Edwin B. Niver, chaplain<br />\nin the United States Marine Corps. The address was delivered by Dr.<br />\nAlonzo E. Taylor, professor of chemistry in the University of Pennsylvania, who was a member of the National Food Commission, which<br />\nrecently went abroad to study the food situation. He spoke on \"The<br />\nLimiting Factors in the Food Supply of a Nation.\"<br />\nThe degree of bachelor of arts was conferred by President Goodnow upon Lester S. Levy, Ko-Chi Sun, and Ensign Richard H. Woodward, captain of the 1917 football team. The degree of master of arts<br />\nwas conferred upon Lieut. Dorsey Richardson, who is now with the<br />\nAmerican Expeditionary Forces in France. Private Joseph L. Krieger,<br />\nof the Sanitary Corps, received the degree of bachelor of science, as<br />\ndid S. Schad and Keener W. Eutsler. The degree of doctor of philosophy was conferred upon Vernon Lynch, J. Broadus Mitchell, and Paul<br />\nF. Bloomhardt, a chaplain in the Navy.<br />\nPresident Goodnow announced the gifts received by the University<br />\nsince last June, and recounted the effects of the war upon the University.

It<br />\nis true enough that there were<br />\nsome to which we might reconcile<br />\nourselves, but there were others<br />\nwhich are irreparable. The sacrifices that the University has been<br />\ncalled upon or has offered to make<br />\nto the god of war are, at least,<br />\ntemporary and will in some future<br />\nday, we believe, bear results commensurate with the present loss.<br />\nBut there have been other misfortunes that have left us with a<br />\nsense of total loss, with no possible hope of recovery. Within the<br />\nlast six months, the faculty of the<br />\nUniversity has been reduced no<br />\nless than four ,times\u2014the last<br />\ntime, only last Wednesday\u2014by the<br />\ninexorable stroke of death.<br />\nThe death of Prof. Edward H.<br />\nSpieker during the past week<br />\nmarks the most recent loss the<br />\nUniversity has suffered within so<br />\nshort a period of time. It marks<br />\nthe loss of a man the productive<br />\nyears of whose life were coextensive with the period of the birth and<br />\ndevelopment of this University. It<br />\nis not for us, who know at best<br />\nonly particular phases of the life<br />\nof Professor Spieker, to attempt<br />\nto appraise his services to the University and to his particular field<br />\n<br />\nA Memorable Day and a New Tradition.<br />\n<br />\nThe forty-second anniversary<br />\nwill live long in the history of<br />\nthe University and in the memories of those who could be present. It was the first Commemoration Day of the great war. If<br />\nthe exercises on this day were always solemn and serious, they<br />\nwere this year more solemn and<br />\nmore serious than ever before;<br />\nthey were more than that\u2014they<br />\nwere grim, they were martial.<br />\nMcCoy Hall, rich in Hopkins history and traditions, was the scene<br />\nof the ceremonies. A guard of<br />\nhonor, formed by the khaki-clad<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins Battalion, lined both sides of the broad<br />\ncorridor through which passed<br />\nthe academic procession, with<br />\nranks thinned noticeably, and<br />\nmarked by the service uniform<br />\nas well as cap and gown. Hundreds of alumni, whose custom it<br />\nhad ever been on this day to pay<br />\ntheir respects to their Alma Mater<br />\nand to refresh cherished memories<br />\nof student days, were missing.<br />\nThe influence of war pervaded the<br />\naddress of the orator, the report<br />\nof the President, and even the invocation. Nevertheless, the feelings that were aroused were those<br />\nnot of despair, but of unyielding<br />\ndetermination.<br />\nNot the least significant feature<br />\nof the exercises was the presence<br />\nof the undergraduate students in<br />\nforce. Whether it was military<br />\nnecessity or the impulse of college<br />\nloyalty that prompted the establishment of this tradition matters not. A tradition has been<br />\nestablished, which no man could<br />\nhelp but feel was worthy of preservation for all future years. The<br />\nhonor and glory that has come<br />\nand that will continue to come to<br />\nthe founders and President and<br />\ngraduates of the University is<br />\nshared with and reflected upon<br />\nall the members of the University.<br />\nThis is a timely opportunity for<br />\nundergraduates to pay the tribute<br />\nthey owe to the founders of the<br />\nUniversity, to the President of<br />\nthe University, and to the graduates of the University; to reconsecrate themselves to the high<br />\nideals and purposes embodied in<br />\nthe name of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n<br />\nRookie Curiosity.<br />\n<br />\nit more than a were coincidence that, upon the occasion of<br />\nevery formal battalion review or<br />\nparade, there should be a snow<br />\nstorm? Is there a conspiracy of<br />\nthe elements against the formal<br />\nexhibition of our battalion?

A<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL PLAN AND ITS<br />\nORIGIN.<br />\nThe move to Homewood and the<br />\nfact that there never had been dormitories and but little opportunity for college life, gave the University the rare chance of an entirely fresh start, untriunmelleo.<br />\nby existing buildings or by tradition. To make the most of this opportunity, President Remsen appointed a committee on \"Student<br />\nLife at Homewood,\" which met<br />\n1ir:4 on Ma:, 25, 1910, an I presented its report before commencement. Besides plans for a gymnasium and a new Levering Hall, to<br />\nhouse not only the V. M. C. A. but<br />\nother student activities, such as<br />\nthe musical clubs and college papers, the report strongly recommended that all unmarried members of the University should live<br />\non the college grounds. Residence<br />\nat the University is important not<br />\nonly for the sake of the college life<br />\nand the memories and closer bond<br />\nwhich it engenders, but that the<br />\ndegrees of the University may represent the highest type of college<br />\nbreeding.

The plan differed<br />\nfrom the English college in that<br />\nno separate provision for instruction or for exercise was made, and<br />\nfrom the American college in endeavoring to supersede class spirit<br />\nby loyalty to a group of men of ,all<br />\nstages of academic development;<br />\nto set up, so to speak, a vertical<br />\nin place of a horizontal division<br />\nof the student body. At present<br />\nthe public sentiment, which has so<br />\nstrong an influence at that age, is<br />\ntoo much that of the student's<br />\nown entering class, which is only<br />\nthe average of men as undeveloped<br />\nas the individual. In a way the<br />\nidea was to extend to all, the advantages now enjoyed by the members of the better college fraternities, but freed from the disadvantages of an undemocratic and<br />\nelective organization. More recent<br />\nevidence of the need of such extension may be drawn from a report<br />\nof a committee of alumni and faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which, after<br />\ncareful investigation, highly commended the influence of fraternities on their own members and<br />\nhoped that their numbers would<br />\nmultiply till a fraternity is available for every student.<br />\n<br />\nof the committee of 1910 until October 1915 when the imminence of<br />\nthe actual removal of the University to Homewood led President<br />\nGoodnow to appoint a new \"Dormitories Committee\" to report on<br />\nthe cost of a suitable building, the<br />\nrental that might be expected and<br />\nthe probable expenses, with a view<br />\nto ascertaining whether interest at<br />\nthe rate of 4 per cent, could be<br />\nearned. In that case the University might be able to finance the<br />\nplan. This committee examined a<br />\nnumber of modern dormitory systems and collected information as<br />\nto plans, cost, rentals, and operation. Among these were the Freshmen Dormitories just opened at<br />\nHarvard, the dormitories planned<br />\nby Mr. Frank Miles Day, of the<br />\nAdvisory Board, for Princeton,<br />\nCornell, and Wellesley, and the<br />\nmuch less expensive new building,<br />\nof the Maryland Agricultural College. They also reconsidered carefully the report of the Committee<br />\nof 1910, with the result that within six weeks they reported to the<br />\nPrpsidefit in favor of the fundamental plan of the former committee, together with a. program<br />\nfor the first building to house 100<br />\nmen, and an estimate that there<br />\nwere 200 men in the University<br />\nwho might be looked upon as prospective tenants, and that an aver-<br />\n<br />\nthey and Mr. Palmer have tried to<br />\naccomplish.<br />\nFundamental Plan. The fundamental principle of the system proposed by the Committee of 1910 and again recommended by<br />\nthe present Committee is the division of<br />\nthe University, for the purpose of residence<br />\nonly, not of instruction, into a number of<br />\nsmall communities, similar to the colleges<br />\nof an English university, rather than to<br />\nthe dormitories of an American college,<br />\nand each one comprising so far as possible<br />\nall the elements found in the University<br />\nbody\u2014undergraduates of all classes, graduate students, fellows and unmarried instructors, rich and poor, fraternity and nonfraternity, \"sports' and \"grinds.\"<br />\nEach<br />\ncommunity should be so far as possible both<br />\ngoverned and managed by a committee of<br />\nits own members, but it must not be permitted to control its membership. Incoming students should be assigned by the<br />\nUniversity in such manner as to preserve<br />\nthe representative character of every community. Each of these should be large<br />\nenough to avoid the appearance of forcing<br />\nintimacy between uncongenial members, but<br />\nsmall enough to foster such intercourse<br />\namong men of different antecedants and<br />\ntastes as will lead at least to mutual knowledge and esteem, and also to secure the influence of the more mature in forming the<br />\ntastes and characters of the younger. This<br />\nis one of the chief objects of the system.<br />\nIt should also be housed so as to further<br />\nthis end and to arouse affection and loyalty<br />\nin later life. The Committee considers from<br />\n100 to 125 persons to be the number best<br />\nsuited to fulfill the former condition, and to<br />\nmeet the latter it deems it essential that<br />\neach community shall have its own dininghall and commons, 14oth rooms to be of a<br />\ndignified and attractive character. Each<br />\nbuilding should enclose three sides of a<br />\nquadrangle, from which all entries open,<br />\nwith a fence or hedge on the fourth side,<br />\nto give the idea of privacy and to furnish<br />\nan outdoor center for the members. While<br />\nthe Committee recommends as much variety<br />\nas possible in detail of buildings, differences<br />\nin the scale of comfort or in cost of living, such as would lead to distinctions between the various communities arising from<br />\nthe pecuniary means of the occupants,<br />\nshould under no circumstances be tolerated.<br />\nPresent conditions at the University render<br />\nstrict attention to economy essential in<br />\nplanning and constructing the residences,<br />\nand the Committee feels that wholesome,<br />\nplain living is the ideal to be sought in any<br />\ncase, but it is equally convinced that econ-<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, FEBRUARY 25, 1918.<br />\n<br />\nomy must not be carried to the point of<br />\nrendering life In the communities mean and<br />\nunattractive. Not only would it be disastrous to have the well-to-do students avoid<br />\nthe residences, but the men who receive a<br />\ndegree from the University should take<br />\nwith them a high standard as to the decencies and amenities of life. For this reason, while avoiding private baths as luxuries, the Committee insists on a well-kept<br />\nlavatory with showers on each floor of each<br />\nentry, that is, for every eight or ten students; on good care of rooms and clean.<br />\nand correct service of meals; on substantial, well-designed furniture; on students'<br />\nrooms not only adequate as places to sleep<br />\nand prepare lessons, but such as to encourage reading and the purchase of books.<br />\nGeneral Characteristics of Building\u2014<br />\na.

The substitute<br />\nhas met with the approval of Dr.<br />\nThomas R.

It has been used in the<br />\nmanufacture of perfumes.

It<br />\nis true enough that there were<br />\nsome to which we might reconcile<br />\nourselves, but there were others<br />\nwhich are irreparable. The sacrifices that the University has been<br />\ncalled upon or has offered to make<br />\nto the god of war are, at least,<br />\ntemporary and will in some future<br />\nday, we believe, bear results commensurate with the present loss.<br />\nBut there have been other misfortunes that have left us with a<br />\nsense of total loss, with no possible hope of recovery. Within the<br />\nlast six months, the faculty of the<br />\nUniversity has been reduced no<br />\nless than four ,times\u2014the last<br />\ntime, only last Wednesday\u2014by the<br />\ninexorable stroke of death.<br />\nThe death of Prof. Edward H.<br />\nSpieker during the past week<br />\nmarks the most recent loss the<br />\nUniversity has suffered within so<br />\nshort a period of time. It marks<br />\nthe loss of a man the productive<br />\nyears of whose life were coextensive with the period of the birth and<br />\ndevelopment of this University. It<br />\nis not for us, who know at best<br />\nonly particular phases of the life<br />\nof Professor Spieker, to attempt<br />\nto appraise his services to the University and to his particular field<br /><br />\nA Memorable Day and a New Tradition.<br /><br />\nThe forty-second anniversary<br />\nwill live long in the history of<br />\nthe University and in the memories of those who could be present. It was the first Commemoration Day of the great war. If<br />\nthe exercises on this day were always solemn and serious, they<br />\nwere this year more solemn and<br />\nmore serious than ever before;<br />\nthey were more than that\u2014they<br />\nwere grim, they were martial.<br />\nMcCoy Hall, rich in Hopkins history and traditions, was the scene<br />\nof the ceremonies. A guard of<br />\nhonor, formed by the khaki-clad<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins Battalion, lined both sides of the broad<br />\ncorridor through which passed<br />\nthe academic procession, with<br />\nranks thinned noticeably, and<br />\nmarked by the service uniform<br />\nas well as cap and gown. Hundreds of alumni, whose custom it<br />\nhad ever been on this day to pay<br />\ntheir respects to their Alma Mater<br />\nand to refresh cherished memories<br />\nof student days, were missing.<br />\nThe influence of war pervaded the<br />\naddress of the orator, the report<br />\nof the President, and even the invocation. Nevertheless, the feelings that were aroused were those<br />\nnot of despair, but of unyielding<br />\ndetermination.<br />\nNot the least significant feature<br />\nof the exercises was the presence<br />\nof the undergraduate students in<br />\nforce. Whether it was military<br />\nnecessity or the impulse of college<br />\nloyalty that prompted the establishment of this tradition matters not. A tradition has been<br />\nestablished, which no man could<br />\nhelp but feel was worthy of preservation for all future years. The<br />\nhonor and glory that has come<br />\nand that will continue to come to<br />\nthe founders and President and<br />\ngraduates of the University is<br />\nshared with and reflected upon<br />\nall the members of the University.<br />\nThis is a timely opportunity for<br />\nundergraduates to pay the tribute<br />\nthey owe to the founders of the<br />\nUniversity, to the President of<br />\nthe University, and to the graduates of the University; to reconsecrate themselves to the high<br />\nideals and purposes embodied in<br />\nthe name of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br /><br />\nRookie Curiosity.<br /><br />\nit more than a were coincidence that, upon the occasion of<br />\nevery formal battalion review or<br />\nparade, there should be a snow<br />\nstorm? Is there a conspiracy of<br />\nthe elements against the formal<br />\nexhibition of our battalion? Did<br />\nit not snow with a vengeance on<br />\nthe day Lieutenant Roselli of the<br />\nItalian Army reviewed us?

A<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL PLAN AND ITS<br />\nORIGIN.<br />\nThe move to Homewood and the<br />\nfact that there never had been dormitories and but little opportunity for college life, gave the University the rare chance of an entirely fresh start, untriunmelleo.<br />\nby existing buildings or by tradition. To make the most of this opportunity, President Remsen appointed a committee on \"Student<br />\nLife at Homewood,\" which met<br />\n1ir:4 on Ma:, 25, 1910, an I presented its report before commencement. Besides plans for a gymnasium and a new Levering Hall, to<br />\nhouse not only the V. M. C. A. but<br />\nother student activities, such as<br />\nthe musical clubs and college papers, the report strongly recommended that all unmarried members of the University should live<br />\non the college grounds. Residence<br />\nat the University is important not<br />\nonly for the sake of the college life<br />\nand the memories and closer bond<br />\nwhich it engenders, but that the<br />\ndegrees of the University may represent the highest type of college<br />\nbreeding. No man is truly college bred who lives at hime and<br />\nsimply attends a day or night<br />\nschool.<br />\nIn search of the best setting for<br />\ncollege life they turned from the<br />\nAmerican system of several dormitories with a common dining hall,<br />\nto the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, and recommended that our<br /><br />\n. _ ____...\u2022 .....:_,.....<br />\n__<br />\n%VIEW'<br />\nU Or. 11{).21ifiC)2Y.bUIL1)ING T DP,.jOliN,S.11C)FICIN.3 f UN IYE25ITY'<br />\n....,... f C)F r GDRT.<br />\nL. pALsmr...<br />\n, Jr.<br /><br />\nA ere p.m,r<br /><br />\n...<br /><br />\n513<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nC.JIAX...l.f..3<br /><br />\nST<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nIN1111.MOr.,..<br /><br />\nMALYLAXD<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nDECIXtbel 3131<br /><br />\n1917<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nstudents would thus be brought<br />\nat once into small circles whose<br />\nesprit de corps would assure their<br />\ndevelopment. The plan differed<br />\nfrom the English college in that<br />\nno separate provision for instruction or for exercise was made, and<br />\nfrom the American college in endeavoring to supersede class spirit<br />\nby loyalty to a group of men of ,all<br />\nstages of academic development;<br />\nto set up, so to speak, a vertical<br />\nin place of a horizontal division<br />\nof the student body. At present<br />\nthe public sentiment, which has so<br />\nstrong an influence at that age, is<br />\ntoo much that of the student's<br />\nown entering class, which is only<br />\nthe average of men as undeveloped<br />\nas the individual. In a way the<br />\nidea was to extend to all, the advantages now enjoyed by the members of the better college fraternities, but freed from the disadvantages of an undemocratic and<br />\nelective organization. More recent<br />\nevidence of the need of such extension may be drawn from a report<br />\nof a committee of alumni and faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which, after<br />\ncareful investigation, highly commended the influence of fraternities on their own members and<br />\nhoped that their numbers would<br />\nmultiply till a fraternity is available for every student.<br /><br />\nof the committee of 1910 until October 1915 when the imminence of<br />\nthe actual removal of the University to Homewood led President<br />\nGoodnow to appoint a new \"Dormitories Committee\" to report on<br />\nthe cost of a suitable building, the<br />\nrental that might be expected and<br />\nthe probable expenses, with a view<br />\nto ascertaining whether interest at<br />\nthe rate of 4 per cent, could be<br />\nearned. In that case the University might be able to finance the<br />\nplan. This committee examined a<br />\nnumber of modern dormitory systems and collected information as<br />\nto plans, cost, rentals, and operation. Among these were the Freshmen Dormitories just opened at<br />\nHarvard, the dormitories planned<br />\nby Mr. Frank Miles Day, of the<br />\nAdvisory Board, for Princeton,<br />\nCornell, and Wellesley, and the<br />\nmuch less expensive new building,<br />\nof the Maryland Agricultural College. They also reconsidered carefully the report of the Committee<br />\nof 1910, with the result that within six weeks they reported to the<br />\nPrpsidefit in favor of the fundamental plan of the former committee, together with a. program<br />\nfor the first building to house 100<br />\nmen, and an estimate that there<br />\nwere 200 men in the University<br />\nwho might be looked upon as prospective tenants, and that an aver-<br /><br />\nthey and Mr. Palmer have tried to<br />\naccomplish.<br />\nFundamental Plan. The fundamental principle of the system proposed by the Committee of 1910 and again recommended by<br />\nthe present Committee is the division of<br />\nthe University, for the purpose of residence<br />\nonly, not of instruction, into a number of<br />\nsmall communities, similar to the colleges<br />\nof an English university, rather than to<br />\nthe dormitories of an American college,<br />\nand each one comprising so far as possible<br />\nall the elements found in the University<br />\nbody\u2014undergraduates of all classes, graduate students, fellows and unmarried instructors, rich and poor, fraternity and nonfraternity, \"sports' and \"grinds.\"<br />\nEach<br />\ncommunity should be so far as possible both<br />\ngoverned and managed by a committee of<br />\nits own members, but it must not be permitted to control its membership. Incoming students should be assigned by the<br />\nUniversity in such manner as to preserve<br />\nthe representative character of every community. Each of these should be large<br />\nenough to avoid the appearance of forcing<br />\nintimacy between uncongenial members, but<br />\nsmall enough to foster such intercourse<br />\namong men of different antecedants and<br />\ntastes as will lead at least to mutual knowledge and esteem, and also to secure the influence of the more mature in forming the<br />\ntastes and characters of the younger. This<br />\nis one of the chief objects of the system.<br />\nIt should also be housed so as to further<br />\nthis end and to arouse affection and loyalty<br />\nin later life. The Committee considers from<br />\n100 to 125 persons to be the number best<br />\nsuited to fulfill the former condition, and to<br />\nmeet the latter it deems it essential that<br />\neach community shall have its own dininghall and commons, 14oth rooms to be of a<br />\ndignified and attractive character. Each<br />\nbuilding should enclose three sides of a<br />\nquadrangle, from which all entries open,<br />\nwith a fence or hedge on the fourth side,<br />\nto give the idea of privacy and to furnish<br />\nan outdoor center for the members. While<br />\nthe Committee recommends as much variety<br />\nas possible in detail of buildings, differences<br />\nin the scale of comfort or in cost of living, such as would lead to distinctions between the various communities arising from<br />\nthe pecuniary means of the occupants,<br />\nshould under no circumstances be tolerated.<br />\nPresent conditions at the University render<br />\nstrict attention to economy essential in<br />\nplanning and constructing the residences,<br />\nand the Committee feels that wholesome,<br />\nplain living is the ideal to be sought in any<br />\ncase, but it is equally convinced that econ-<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, FEBRUARY 25, 1918.<br /><br />\nomy must not be carried to the point of<br />\nrendering life In the communities mean and<br />\nunattractive. Not only would it be disastrous to have the well-to-do students avoid<br />\nthe residences, but the men who receive a<br />\ndegree from the University should take<br />\nwith them a high standard as to the decencies and amenities of life. For this reason, while avoiding private baths as luxuries, the Committee insists on a well-kept<br />\nlavatory with showers on each floor of each<br />\nentry, that is, for every eight or ten students; on good care of rooms and clean.<br />\nand correct service of meals; on substantial, well-designed furniture; on students'<br />\nrooms not only adequate as places to sleep<br />\nand prepare lessons, but such as to encourage reading and the purchase of books.<br />\nGeneral Characteristics of Building\u2014<br />\na.
