However, Dean<br />\nMichael Hooker said he thinks the<br />\nmove \"makes sense for Steve.\u2014<br />\n\"Steve's been ripe to move<br />\ninto a junior associate deanship<br />\nfor some time now,\" said Hooker,<br />\nwho originally nominated Muller<br />\nfor the position. \"He'd be crazy<br />\nnot to seize this opportunity.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, a storm cloud of<br />\ncontradiction and confusion surrounds the subject of replacing<br />\nMuller. On Wednesday afternoon,<br />\n<br />\nMusic Excites Crowd To Frenzy<br />\nContary to the expectation<br />\nof the Spring Fair Committee.<br />\nthe replacement of rock music<br />\nby more\"mellow\" inusic proved<br />\nto increase the degree of violence at this year's fair. Incidents on Gilman and Shriver<br />\nquads were apparently spurred<br />\non by the performance of jazz<br />\nand Dixieland Jazz and Big<br />\nband music.<br />\nOn Shriver quad Saturday<br />\nmorning. Dean George Owen<br />\nwas apparently swept away with<br />\nenthusiasm by a popular Tommie Dorsey tune. The dean<br />\nreportedly had been sitting with<br />\na group of faculty on the lawn in<br />\nfront of Shriver Hall. The group<br />\nhad been there since 9:00 a.m.<br />\nand were seen consuming liberal<br />\namounts of mint juleps from a<br />\nten gallon ice cooler.<br />\nThe band finished playing at<br />\n1:30 p.m. with an upbeat<br />\nTommie Dorsey number and<br />\n<br />\nOwen was apparently enraged by<br />\ntheir refusal to play an encore.<br />\nHe threw his mint julep into the<br />\nface of the band leader and then<br />\nturned his anger on the innocent<br />\ncrowd.<br />\nHis first victim was seven<br />\nyear old Steven Lally who had<br />\nbeen dancing with his pregnant<br />\nmother on the macadam in front<br />\nof the stage. With one quick kick<br />\nof Owen's wing-tipped golfing<br />\nshoes the troy was pitched into<br />\nthe percussion section of the<br />\nAnything Goes band. Owen<br />\nthen . said, \"I want that baby and<br />\nI'm going to get it.\" A smile<br />\nslowly spread over Owen's face<br />\nas he picked up a tomahawk out<br />\nof the wicker picnic basket and<br />\nproceeded to chop the pregnant<br />\nwoman into small pieces.<br />\nSecurity was able to apprehend Owen before he reached<br />\nhis next victim, Franciscan nun<br />\ncarrying a guitar case. Owen<br />\n<br />\nPSU To Manage<br />\nGilman Coffee Shop<br />\nThe Progressive Students<br />\nUnion announced this week that<br />\nbeginning next fall, they will<br />\nmanage and run the Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop. PSU spokesman<br />\nNeil Smith said the group hoped<br />\nto \"take the Coffee Shop away<br />\nfrom the imperialist dogs.\"<br />\nUnder the Shop's new administration, only one type of edible<br />\nfood would .be served. Cindy<br />\nStagoff explained that brown<br />\ncookies would replace the Coffee Shop's current range of<br />\npastries and candy.<br />\n\"It would eliminate the<br />\n<br />\nproblem of free choice,\" Stagoff<br />\ntold the News-Litter,\"which is a<br />\nsupposedly 'democratic' process.<br />\nYou 'choose' or 'elect' the best<br />\nor most eligible bun or tea.

Betsy then smashed an<br />\niron shovel against the man's<br />\nskull which fell to the ground<br />\nand split open. She reached into<br />\nthe skull, mashing her fist in the<br />\nmushy brain tissue.

For the last<br />\nthree months, Hurley has been<br />\nin constant fear for his life., lie<br />\nbelieves that someone is trying<br />\nto kill him.

At approximately<br />\n2:20 p.m. on Saturday, March<br />\n20, Hurley was chased through<br />\nFarragut Square by approximately 200 pigeons. Swooping<br />\n<br />\nand swerving, the pigeons tried<br />\nto remove Hurley's facial hair<br />\nand outer clothing, thus leaving<br />\nhim free to be attacked a la The<br />\nBirds.<br />\n<br />\nmaintain that Hurley provoked<br />\nthe birds by throwing coffee on<br />\nthem while walking through the<br />\nsquare. Eisenberg and Karras,<br />\nunlike Hurley,<br />\nfound the<br />\nincident humorous. \"He just<br />\ntossed the coffee on them and<br />\nBOOM! They were flying all<br />\nover the place, especially above<br />\nHurley,\" commented Eisenberg.<br />\n\"Andrew took off and they<br />\nfollowed him. He was fortunate<br />\nthat he could run into a Metro<br />\nStation. They didn't look too<br />\npleased about the whole thing,\"<br />\ncommented Karras. Both eyewitnesses discount Hurley's<br />\ntheories about conspiracies, insisting that Hurley was the<br />\ninstigator of the would-be attack.<br />\n<br />\nThe reason for the attack<br />\nunclear,<br />\nremains<br />\nalthough<br />\nHurley has proposed several<br />\nalternatives ranging from a Communist plot and conspiracy to an<br />\nattempt by Ayala Hecht and<br />\nSuzanne Conklin to remove him<br />\nfrom the Editorial Board of the<br />\nNews-Letter so that they could<br />\nobtain control of the paper.<br />\nEyewitnesses Steven Eisenberg and Alan Karras have told<br />\nWashington authorities a different story, however.<br />\nThey<br />\n<br />\nWho Wants To Teach Hopkins Undergraduates Anyway?<br />\nIn a recent meeting of the<br />\nAcademic Council, the Johns<br />\nHopkins University's faculty admitted that the spring's controversy over tenure raised deeper<br />\nquestions about the teaching of<br />\ngraduate students.<br />\n\"What it conies down to,\"<br />\nsaid Professor Hogan,\"is that we<br />\ndon't like to teach undergraduates.\"<br />\n\"Let's be honest,\" added<br />\nProfessor Newman. \"Ufidergrad-'<br />\n<br />\nuates aren't serious.

Hopkins has come a long was since '72 when it<br />\nwas a little two-campus school with only Baltimore<br />\nto call home. Now Hopkins is a multi-faceted, multinational University.<br />\nThe early growth (Peabody, SAIS, APL) put<br />\nHopkins in the Ivy League League and made a strong<br />\nfoundation for the extensive work of the past decade.<br />\nThe expansion of the East Baltimore campus to include<br />\nthe School of Acupuncture and Faith Healing has<br />\nalmost doubled the revenues from that campus. Admission is highly selective, of course, but tuition is<br />\n535,000/year. I am quite pleased that after only seven<br />\nyears in existence, the School of Acupuncture .and<br />\nFaith Healing is considered the finest institution for<br />\nthe training of acupuncturists and faith healers in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\n1982 saw Hopkins make a giant step from an<br />\nAmerican University to an international education<br />\nnetwork. As the world got smaller and smaller, I found<br />\nit necessary that Hopkins get larger, until one day (I<br />\nestimate 1998) I expect they will converge and Hopkins will he synonymous with world education. Some<br />\nof the exchange campuses 1 have established include:<br />\nNanjing, China; Brazilia, Brazil; Hamburg, Germany;<br />\nTokyo, Japan; Sydney, Australia; the Falkland Islands;<br />\nHampton, Bermuda; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; Nice,<br />\nFrance;just to name a few.

At that time Ronald Reagan was still<br />\npresident of the United States and I found the application of the new New Federalism particularly applicable<br />\nto the Hopkins situation. I decided at that point that,<br />\nto achieve greater growth, I had to decentralize the<br />\nadministration. Having a centralized administration,<br />\nespecially in Baltimore, seemed to be an inefficient<br />\nmethod of running the University. So 1 sent Michael<br />\nHooker to Bennington College to prepare for the<br />\neventual annexation of Bennington to Hopkins, forming the Bennington Campus for the Fine Arts. I<br />\ndecided to get rid of all the other remaining deans, as<br />\nthey really were only there for cocktail party purposes.<br />\nI, of course, kept Jakie Hall on as my special assistant<br />\nin charge of the international network and cocktail<br />\nparties, but otherwise I assumed singlehanded control<br />\nof the university.<br />\nAlso during the Reagan administration, Hopkins was given the responsibility of collecting federal<br />\nincome taxes, for as former president Reagan said:<br />\n\"Why should we maintain a federal government merely<br />\nfor the purpose of collecting taxes which we would<br />\nimmediately hand over the the Hopkins Applied<br />\nPhysics Lab for the military effort? It made much<br />\nmore sense to have Hopkins collect the money, develop<br />\nand build the defense equipment, and then run the<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nPresident Muller, Dean Muller and Special Assistant Hall<br />\n<br />\narmed forces.\" When the federal government was at<br />\nlast disbanded, Reagan joined the Hopkins faculty as<br />\nhead of staff for the Applied Cosmetology Lab in<br />\nNantucket. I had always respected Mr. Reagan's fine<br />\nwork in the area of cosmetology and found him a great<br />\nasset to the institution.<br />\nOne of my greatest achievements at Hopkins<br />\nwas the creation of the Applied Biology Lab in 1984.<br />\nABL is directed by Dr. Kenneth Lynn, who earned a<br />\nsecond Ph.D. in Biology in order that he might take<br />\nthis position on the Virgin Islands. Lynn did a commendable job of making Muller clones to fill the<br />\nadministrative offices I had vacated, first in the initial<br />\npurge of '72, then again in '83. Although I had no<br />\ntrouble running the University singlehandedly, the lack<br />\nof administrators was a difficult problem,especially in<br />\nterms of scheduling lunch dates and News-Letter<br />\ninterviews.<br />\nIn my constant pursuit of ways to make the<br />\nUniversity more cost-efficient, I found that one good<br />\nway of trimming costs was to significantly alter the<br />\nundergraduate program. Undergraduates had originally<br />\nbeen accepted at the University in order that JHU<br />\nreceive University accreditation. We needed University<br />\nstatus in order to pull in the big government research<br />\nprojects, and our name was widely respected in the<br />\ncommunity (which made it easier to fix social science<br />\nstudies without raising anyone's suspicions). However,<br />\nit is not necessary to maintain 2000 undergrads in<br />\norder to keep our accreditation, and it was costing far<br />\nmore to educate the undergrads than they were bringing in in revenue. So I cut back the number of students accepted in each freshman class from 2000 to 10.<br />\nTen undergraduates really makes teaching far easier for<br />\nthe faculty, because they each only have to offer one<br />\ncourse every 15 years, instead of two or three per year.<br />\nThis means they can devote much more time to research, which means they pull in more grant money,<br />\nwhich means that Hopkins keeps getting bigger and<br />\nricher. Besides, undergraduates really litter the campus.<br />\nSince I instituted a program for precocious grad<br />\nstudents, we can not get 10 to 12 good years of research out of these kids before we have to send them<br />\nout into the University job market. This puts us miles<br />\nahead of our competitors. Harvard has really been<br />\nstruggling to stay afloat, even though we have been<br />\ngenerous enough to send them some of our best<br />\ngraduates.<br />\nLooking back over the past two decades I have<br />\nseen a lot of improvements. But I will not stop here.<br />\nThe future holds endless possibilities for the continued<br />\ngrowth and expansion of the Johns Hopkins family.<br />\n<br />\nKillFine Arts CampusIn Vermont<br />\n\"Frankly, I'm surprised he pulled it off.\"<br />\nMichael Hooker, Dean of the Johns Hopkins University's<br />\nFine Arts campus at Bennington, Vermont, tilted back<br />\nin his chair as he reflected on Steven Muller's successful<br />\ni-ansformation of Berinington\u2014just ten years ago a<br />\nhighly respected independent arts college\u2014into yet<br />\nanother thriving limb of that multifaceted, multinational<br />\norganism whose heart is located in Baltimore. \"It was all<br />\nconducted with the utmost of secrecy,\" Hooker continued. \"1 myself was unaware of the full extent of<br />\nMuller's intentions for me. But when he told me to<br />\nshave my mustache, I knew something was up.\"<br />\nSensing what he saw to be a \"need to have other,<br />\nmore non-science oriented feathers in our wide-brimmed<br />\nUniversity cap,\" President Muller acquired Bennington<br />\nin 1982, when he arranged the appointment of Hooker<br />\nto the presidency of the college. \"After that it was only<br />\na matter of time before Muller played his ace,\" Hooker<br />\nremembered. \"Needless to say, is came as quite a shock<br />\nto the existing Bennington staff.\"<br />\nThe \"ace\" Hooker refers to was the deployment.<br />\nof several thousand Muller clones (provided by the<br />\nUniversity's Applied Biology Lab) around the perimeter<br />\nof the Bennington campus, equipped with portable<br />\nbars and witty stories intended to entice the college's<br />\nlargely female population into demanding annexation.<br />\n\"They [the clones] won the women over immediately,\"<br />\nHooker said. \"The faculty had no choice but to relent\".<br />\nEverywhere now at Bennington can be seen the<br />\nresults of placement under the JHU banner of progress.<br />\nHappy Hopkins premeds, sent to Bennington to fulfill<br />\ndistribution requirements, wander wide-eyed, instilled<br />\nwith poetic spirit and joie de vivre. There is a 100-seat<br />\n<br />\nblack-box theater, named in honor of Mark Trachtenberg (Hopkins BA '81), where grainy prints of B-grade<br />\nmovies are shown with the sound turned all the way up.<br />\nEager Blue Jay lacrosse players sit cross legged anioni<br />\ndandelions and discuss linguistics with helpful Bennington coeds.<br />\nMeanwhile, on JHU's Homewood campus,similai<br />\nchanges are evident. Energetic professors of English an(<br />\ncreative writing imported from Bennington have showr<br />\nof the once-lauded John Barth for the mechanistic and<br />\nrepetitice poseur he had always been. The Rathskellar<br />\nhas been appropriated as a thrice-weekly forum for the<br />\nexchange of meaningful dialogue, good food, and<br />\nhonest, open sexual encounter. This change was spurred<br />\non in part by the influx of Bennington females at<br />\nHomewood, which served to balance out a formerly<br />\nlackluster male/female ration.<br />\n\"Yes, ration,\" Hooker said. \"We found that<br />\nmandatory frequent sex did m uch for<br />\nthe emotional well being of students on both sides of the arts-andsciences fence. It opened up the more naive Hopkins<br />\nmales, and made the more mature Bennington women<br />\naware ofjust how hard some people have it.\"<br />\nAnother major part of the Hopkins/Bennington<br />\nexchange was the hiring of Joseph Levine (Hopkins BA<br />\n'82) as Assistant Dean of Fine Arts. \"I kept getting<br />\nletters from Joe complaining about the poor attendance<br />\nat the yearly 'Kenan Awards ceremonies. They were<br />\nsigned 'A Really, Really Frustrated But Eager-to-be-ofAssistance Patron of the Arts.' I figured what the hell,<br />\nI'll hire him. It certainly beat selling frozen yogurt<br />\ndoor-to-door, which was what he had been doing.\"<br />\n<br />\nDean Levine's most vital contribution to the<br />\nUniversity was the creation of the Kenan Arts Festival, a<br />\nthree-day event held in a large pasture near Bennington.<br />\n\"We get about 150,000 people out a year,\" Hooker<br />\nsaid. \"They really support the arts up here.\"<br />\nThe highlight of each year's festival is the performance of Breastheating, a play Dean Levine himself<br />\nwrote as a postgraduate,about the gradual revelation of<br />\nlesbian tendencies between two seven-year-old girls<br />\nduring a wild night at Walt Disney World, Florida.<br />\n\"Levine always wants to get Joseph Papp to direct,<br />\nbecause he likes the ring of the name,\" Hooker recounted. The current staging, however, is by El. L. Gruman,<br />\none of off-off-Broadway's most prominent practitioners<br />\nof the Theater of Pretense.<br />\nHooker is pleased with the changes Muller and<br />\ncompany have effected in the past ten years. \"Steve has<br />\nbeen doing a great job,\" he said,\"My only hope is that<br />\nsomeday we'll be able to turn down the volume at the<br />\nTrachtenberg.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe happy, hippie Hooker<br />\n<br />\n\fMake-up Tests<br />\n<br />\nPrecocious Grad Students<br />\nUnder the beneficient twenty-year Muller regime.<br />\nnumerous modifications within the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity structure have created a unique institution of<br />\nhigher learning. Instead of the average university with<br />\nsubdivisions of undergraduate colleges and a program of<br />\ng,riduate studies, President Muller has &emphasized<br />\nundergraduate studies and improved upon the graduate<br />\nprogram to a startling degree. By cutting back the<br />\nundergraduate population to a meager ten students.<br />\nMuller has been able to make major cuts in undergraduate services and apply the extra monies to other<br />\ngraduate programs.<br />\nPerhaps one of the most unusual programs<br />\ninitiated because of this abundance of funds is the<br />\nSchool for Precocious Children (SPC), a 526_4 niithon<br />\ncomplex situated on the site that once contained the<br />\nfreshman dorms. Completed in 1987, this addition to<br />\nHopkins graduate program deals exdusisely with the<br />\ntraining of precocious oriental grad students.<br />\nWith an average entrance age of five. the SPC is<br />\nan unprecedented school of higher learning_ Its ranks<br />\nare drawn from a program instituted by Dr_ Julian<br />\nStanley, noted psychologist and innovative researcher on<br />\nthe intellectually gifted child. Admission to the SPC is<br />\ndetermined by a battery of tests designed specifically in<br />\nmind for the school's youthful populace_ Little has been<br />\nrevealed as to the nature of these tests since they are<br />\nclassified to prevent program espionage, but SPC admissions director Steve Muller has admitted that \"we only<br />\ntake the youngest, the liveliest, the brightest leaning.of<br />\ncourse, toward the most mathematicallly and scientifically precocious.\"<br />\nWhen questioned on the steadily decreasing age<br />\nlevel of tstudents admitted to the program. Muller was<br />\nevasive. \"Well,\" he said. \"Um___no.\" The Dean of<br />\nGraduate Studies had a similar reaction. \"Well.\" he said.<br />\n\"Urn...no.\" Ditto for the Dean of Homewood Faculties,<br />\nDirector of Advising and Counseling, and Director of<br />\nGraduate Student Activities. Only the Provost. Dr_ S.<br />\nMuller, whose resemblance to President Steven Muller<br />\nis striking, had this to say: \"We at Hopkins are proud to<br />\noffer a unique educational opportunity to the precocious youth of our society. As the only true University<br />\ncommitted to advanced research, we are obligated to<br />\ncontinue in that great tradition. To do so, we must draw<br />\nfrom the ever-increasing ranks of precocious children as<br />\nthey are the lifebl(x)d of our society. At the moment.<br />\nour precocious children account for more than 20<br />\npercent of the total graduate student body. As to the<br />\npoint raised that the students seem to be getting younger. I can only point to the increasing mutancy rate<br />\namongst our New York State students_ due perhaps. to<br />\nthe simultaneous meltdown and combustion of the<br />\nstate's two nuclear reactors at Indian Point and Shoreham-Wading River some years ago. The majority of our<br />\nstudent body comes from the nearby eastern seaboard.<br />\nand it has become obvious that more and mote freaks<br />\nare being produced in these areas. Happily enough,they<br />\nare intellectual freaks, but freaks nonetheless_ That, of<br />\ncourse, is off the record.The News-Litter also spoke with Tsu Tan Konfour year old, second year grad student in the<br />\na<br />\n,<br />\nKlin<br />\nAnthropology department, and member of the GRO<br />\nJohnny, as he is known to friends, is a typical exampk<br />\nof the new Hopkins student. 7ZK:<br />\nTZK: I am told that my first words were Sinantiunpus<br />\npekinensis; no Mama or Papa for me.

It is my impression that you really don't care if PC's are accepted or<br />\nnot since you yourself seem to have found your own<br />\nlittle niche<br />\n77K: I wouldn't call it selfish, but you're right in one<br />\nrespect.

The latest in<br />\ntechnological equipment. plus a team of international<br />\npenguin watchers and natural scientists, make the JHU<br />\nPenguin Observatory a stepping stone for natural<br />\nhistory. Johns Hopkins alone can't take all the credit<br />\nfor this southern phenomenon: it was Steve Muller<br />\nwho brought the Islands back, both economically and<br />\npolitically.<br />\nWhen former Secretary of State Alexander Haig<br />\ntook the Islands from Argentine-British hands in 1982<br />\nand put them in Muller's lap. it was like giving the Inner<br />\nHarbor to James Rouse. Muller knew just how to<br />\nrevitalize the area and make the islands productive.<br />\nAfter he cleaned up the nuclear spill left from the war,<br />\n<br />\n'he tried to find ways, to boost the Islands' faltering<br />\neconomy and low morale. His KOA Kammound<br />\ncampaign was just one way of bringing tourist dollars to<br />\nthe Falklands. Putting Johns Ilopkins money behind the<br />\nnow famous Falklands Hilton and Convention Center<br />\nwas another nice touch. The Falklands are being considered now as a possible site for the 1996 Olympics. The<br />\nMullerian Parliament, which governs the gentle, peaceloving people of the Falklands, has plans to finance a<br />\nsubway to mainland Argentina for the event. Perhaps<br />\nMuller's most successful venture in the South American<br />\nenterprise is his fast-food chain, featuring island delicacies like turtle tacos, penguin burgers, and Homewood<br />\nDeli-style fried sea urchins. Mr. Popper's can be found<br />\nall over the hemisphere, and is gaining popularity in<br />\nseveral major European cities.<br />\nAs far as the economic and political improvement of the Falkland Islands goes, the Penguin Observatory is just the beginning.

HOOK<br />\nIt was kind of a shock, and it<br />\ndidn't get much publicity, but Lawrence<br />\nOlivier was in town last week for a one<br />\nnight recreation of Hamlet. I got there a<br />\nlittle late because I had to argue with the<br />\nparking lot attendant outside who insisted on charging me even though I<br />\nexplained who I was. So I walked in and<br />\nfound out that Hamlet was the guy up<br />\nthere thinking about killing the guy who<br />\nkilled his father. He drove his girlfriend<br />\nOphelia to suicide and killed her father,<br />\nbut mostly he stands there and just kind<br />\nof thinks out loud. It all leads up to a<br />\nbloody last scene where Hamlet, his<br />\nuncle, hi4 mother, and his girlfriend's<br />\nbrother wind up dead, but I won't give<br />\naway how it happens because you might<br />\nwant to see it yourself.<br />\nLord Olivier (or Larry as he asked<br />\n<br />\nstage. I told him to call me Walt) was<br />\ncertainly loud enough, but I began to<br />\nwonder if it was his idea to dress in black<br />\nthe whole play. It struckme as overdoing<br />\nit a little. After all, Hamlet spends about<br />\n90 percent of his time bitching and<br />\nmoaning about death over and over again.<br />\nWe all know that death is mysterious and<br />\nfrightening and all that, but there are<br />\nonly so many ways to state the same idea<br />\nfor four hours. Of course this really isn't<br />\nOlivier's fault; the playwright seems<br />\nintent on focusing on the personal<br />\ntraumas of one member of the elite class<br />\nwith no social conscience for the way<br />\nthat these programs relate to the toiling<br />\nmasses. hamlet is a politically insensitive<br />\nplay, unlike, say, Julius Caesar, or<br />\nBlossius of Cumae.<br />\nThe lack of respect for the common man was glaring in the vulgar and<br />\npointless graveyard scene whose m<br />\n<br />\nBrainwashed crowds applaud Hook's review<br />\nobject is to laugh at the working stiffs and Polonius, who was just too short to<br />\nand show how they just get in the be convincing.<br />\nThe production had some remarkprince's way, but there was no questioning Hamlet's determination. Two ably inconsistent aspects. For one thing,<br />\nminutes later he kicked the gravediggers they kept saying that they were in<br />\noff the stage, preferring instead to talk Denmark, but they all spoke with English<br />\naccents and in archaic forms like this was<br />\nabout old times with a skull.<br />\nOphelia was also played by a very supposed to be impressive (Maybe the<br />\nstrong actress. However, they cast a very British think they still own Denmark as<br />\ndark, bosomy, bourgeoise feminist/actress well as Argentina).<br />\nOverall, the play had a strong<br />\ntype, not the type that find very attractive at all, which leads me to wonder who enough plot to carry it through, although<br />\nI thought it dragged a little in the first act<br />\nwas doing the casting.<br />\nThe rest of the cast played their when I found myself reading War and<br />\nparts well except for Rosencrantz, who Peace and discovering a novel new interwas awful and had a disgustingly big nose, pretation.

He has, a normal<br />\nchildhood with the typical adolescent fantasies.

As the weather in Bangor<br />\n:was typically cold, John had<br />\nbeen sleeping with an electric<br />\nblanket since he was six years<br />\nold. However, on this night.just<br />\nas he was about to go to sleep,<br />\nJohn's mother came in and took<br />\naway his electric blanket.

Yes, John had become a<br />\n\"man.\" Ile could now screw.<br />\nUnfortunately, it wasn't long<br />\nbefore John's mother discovered<br />\nwhy John -spent so much time<br />\nalone in his room.

Finally, when he tried it<br />\nagain, he couldn't do it anymore. The trauma had been too<br />\ngreat.<br />\nFive yeius later. John finally<br />\ndecided he had to do something<br />\nabout his handicap. Heading<br />\ndown to Boston for a Red Sox<br />\ngame, he decided to visit the<br />\nCombat Zone instead. He went<br />\ninside what seemed to be a<br />\nreputable whorehouse and asked<br />\nfor a room. When the lady at<br />\nthe desk asked John if he had<br />\nany special requests, he didn't<br />\nknow what to say. After all,<br />\nJohn was just a naive kid from<br />\nRemembering someBangor.<br />\n<br />\nphoto courtesy Office of Student Services<br />\n<br />\nit. John quickly sprinted down<br />\nthe steps onto the streets of<br />\nBoston. \u2022<br />\nDriving near Faneuil Hall,<br />\nall of a sudden, an idea popped<br />\ninto John's head. Quickly, he<br />\ndrove to the nearest department<br />\nstore. It just had to work. It<br />\ncost only $25. a lot cheaper than<br />\nthe lady wearing a garter, belt.<br />\nHe started the long trek<br />\nback to Bangor, but halfway<br />\nthere, John decided he couldn't<br />\nwait any longer. He got off the<br />\nhighway and headed into a gas<br />\nstation with his purchase. lie<br />\nprayed there was an outlet in the<br />\nrestroom. Sure enough there<br />\nwas. John quickly plugged the<br />\n<br />\nclothing so having only one This was Nick's idea because<br />\ncloset between them isn't a Tom often has the urge to give<br />\nproblem. They usually don't eat consecutive shits, especially<br />\nin, so the kitchen is seldom used. when he has the runs.<br />\nAnd if they get constipated.<br />\nBut the one problem they do<br />\nonly time this occurs is<br />\nThe<br />\nthe<br />\nbathroom.<br />\nis<br />\nhave<br />\nduring Passover when they both<br />\nThere's only one toilet, one<br />\nget stuck. But it all conies out<br />\nsink and one shower. And both<br />\nm the end so they don't<br />\neven<br />\ncracked<br />\nare<br />\nsink<br />\nthe shower and<br />\nso they seldom wash their hands make any kind of compensation.<br />\nWith the contest only a<br />\nand take showers. That's why<br />\nold, Nick is leading by<br />\nmonth<br />\nthey<br />\nthey wear hats because<br />\ntwo shits. Two weeks ago Tom<br />\nnever wash 'their hair. But they<br />\nhad a commanding lead but Nick<br />\ndo shit a lot. Maybe that's why<br />\nsome bad cheese and pulled<br />\nate<br />\nthey're<br />\nwhen<br />\nthey only smell<br />\nahead. He was shining between<br />\nconstipated but that's seldom<br />\nthe case. As I said, they do shit four and five times a day while<br />\nTom was only averaging two or<br />\na lot.<br />\nShitting is relative and it three which is one above Nick's<br />\ndoes depend on the person and usual output. But enough of<br />\n<br />\nthis shit.<br />\nTom just got home from<br />\nschool, and the first thing he did<br />\nwas run to the bathroom, lay<br />\ndown his strips of toilet paper<br />\nand read the newspaper. And,<br />\nof course, well, you know what<br />\nhe did.<br />\nWhen he was about to get to<br />\nthe good part, Nick rushed into<br />\nthe partment and began to<br />\nscream and rant and rave. This<br />\nwas not the usual Nick. It think<br />\nhe really had to go this time.<br />\nHis pants weren't wet or damp<br />\nas far as I could tell. That<br />\nreminds me. Both Tom and<br />\nNick have tremendous control<br />\nwhen it comes to holding in<br />\ntheir shits and urinations, but<br />\nThey<br />\nespecially their shits.<br />\nreally don't care about their<br />\nurine because they don't mind<br />\nstrange urinals, but when it<br />\nconies to their shits, they refuse<br />\nto shit in any toilet besides their<br />\nown. \u2022<br />\nNick continued to yell for<br />\nthe next 15 minutes and at some<br />\npoints pleaded with Tom to<br />\nhurry it up.<br />\nTom refused and rightly so.<br />\nHe got to the toilet first, and the<br />\nrule was the first person to get<br />\nto the toilet owned full rights to<br />\nthe toilet for as long as he<br />\nwanted to sit on the toilet,<br />\nwhich, by the way, had a foam<br />\nseat that Tom bought two days<br />\nbefore the contest began.<br />\nWhile Nick was waiting to<br />\ndo whatever he had to do, which<br />\nmost,,, likely was a shit. he began<br />\npicking his nose which he did<br />\nwhenever he was nervous. He<br />\nwould sit down on his desk<br />\nchair, stick his first finger of his .<br />\nright hand (he never used his left<br />\nhand) up his right_ nostril and<br />\npull out a wad of mucus. He not<br />\nonly pulled it out, but he would<br />\nalso squeeze it around between<br />\nhis fingers until it became sticky<br />\nand manageable so he was able<br />\nto smell it. He did this for about<br />\nfive minutes before he switched<br />\nto his left nostril. It seemed<br />\nstrange but his right nostril<br />\nalways produced more.

This year<br />\nthe same person bought the<br />\nrights for $4000, sold them to<br />\nsomeone else who sold them to<br />\nChannel 2, who televised the<br />\nCarolina game and is scheduled<br />\nto telecast the Maryland game<br />\nSaturday.<br />\n***<br />\nEvery four years, beginning<br />\nin 1974, the team takes a<br />\npost-seasonal trip. The first one<br />\nwas to California. In 1978, they<br />\nwent to Dallas and California,<br />\nand last year, because of the<br />\nWorld Games this summer, they<br />\nwent to Canada, Atlanta, Miami<br />\nand the Bahamas. The purpose<br />\nof the trip is to promote lacrosse<br />\nin certain areas and to build<br />\npublic relations between the<br />\nUniversity and the alumni.<br />\nLast year, they first went to<br />\nToronto to play two games<br />\nAn<br />\nagainst Team Canada.<br />\nalumni reception with President<br />\nMuller followed. In Atlanta and<br />\nMiami they played against club<br />\nteams. They then left Miami<br />\nand spent three days in the<br />\nBahamas for some sun and<br />\nrelaxation, which did not cost<br />\nany extra money because of the<br />\nplane package offered by Eastern.<br />\nThe post-seasonal trips are<br />\npaid for by gate sales for one<br />\ngame each year, and the program<br />\nsales, which amount to $7000The players<br />\n8000 a year,<br />\nare only required to pay for<br />\ntheir meals.<br />\n***<br />\nWhen Gary Rubert, who is<br />\nnow the Assistant Director of<br />\nAthletics at UMBC, arrived at<br />\nHopkins'to coach the basketball<br />\nteam in 1970, he was approached by then Athletic Director Marshall Turner.<br />\n\"Mr. Turner made it quite<br />\nclear that lacrosse had a high<br />\nimage at Hopkins and explained<br />\nto me the tradition,\" says<br />\nRubert. \"lie made certain that<br />\nGary Basketball would understand that he wouldn't get as<br />\nmany fans and as much press as<br />\nthe lacrosse team.\"<br />\nThings have not changed.<br />\n<br />\nLast Saturday the team<br />\nhosted Washington College for a<br />\ndouble-header. This was also the<br />\nteam's alumni day, with many<br />\nformer players returning for the<br />\nfestivities.<br />\nWashington College won the<br />\nfirst game 3-0. Their pitchers<br />\nlimited the Jays to 3 hits.<br />\nWashington took the lead in the<br />\ntop of the first. With one out, a<br />\nwalk and a triple gave Washington College its first run. The<br />\nsecond run scored when Bobby<br />\nRodrigues dropped the third<br />\nstrike and threw to first to retire<br />\nthe batter. The runner sneaked<br />\nhome as Rodrigues made the<br />\nplay at first.<br />\nThe Blue Jays threatened in<br />\nthe bottom of the fifth. They<br />\nloaded the bases on walks to<br />\nCardwell and Martino and a<br />\nRandy Greehan bunt single.<br />\nAndy Lachance, who was two<br />\nfor two up to this point, hit a<br />\nhard liner up the middle. The<br />\nWashington pitcher somehow<br />\nspeared it barehanded and threw<br />\nto first for a double play. Evan<br />\nLipsitz walked to load the bases<br />\nagain, but Whitney Burke ended<br />\nthe threat with a long fly out.<br />\nWashington added another<br />\nrun in the seventh to make the<br />\nfinal 3-0. Steve Hand pitched a<br />\nstrong game but a couple of bad<br />\npitches allowed Washington to<br />\nscore their runs.<br />\nDave Provost rebounded<br />\nfrom his first loss by allowing<br />\n<br />\nthe Washington team only 3 hits<br />\nin picking up his fifth victory.<br />\nHe also lowered his team-leading<br />\nearned run average to 2.14.<br />\nThe Jays broke the game<br />\nopen with six runs in the top of<br />\nWith one out, Bob<br />\nthe first.<br />\nMartino lead off with a single<br />\nand scored on Andy Lachance's<br />\ntriple. Lachance scored when<br />\nthe Washington defense threw<br />\nthe ball away. Al Volk then<br />\nwalked and stole second. He<br />\nscored on a double by Rusty<br />\nRay.<br />\nA Bill Miller double<br />\nfollowing a Doug Gneiser walk<br />\ndrove in two more. The sixth<br />\nrun scored when Tom Harmon's<br />\nsingle sent Miller home.<br />\nHopkins picked up five<br />\nmore in the fifth. Evan Lipsitz<br />\nsingled and walks to Gneiser and<br />\nMiller loaded the bases. The<br />\nthree scored on a triple by Tom<br />\nHarmon. Alan Heaton drove<br />\nHarmon home on a sacrifice fly.<br />\nThe Jays got one more on singles<br />\nby Lachance and Volk after a<br />\nwalk to Martino.<br />\nProvost lost his shut out in<br />\nthe sixth as Washington picked<br />\nup a run making the final score<br />\n11-1.<br />\nAs has been the case all<br />\nseason, the Jays were once again<br />\nAgainst<br />\nerratic this week.<br />\nWashington .the defense was<br />\nsuperb, committing only one<br />\nerror in the doubleheader. Yet<br />\nit was once again shoddy in the<br />\n<br />\nDickinson game. The hitting has<br />\nimproved as the team batting<br />\naverage is beginning to climb.<br />\nAs low as .236 a couple of weeks<br />\nago, it is now .244. The hitting<br />\nremains inconsistent. The team<br />\nscores in bunches, but they may<br />\ngo through long periods without<br />\nmuch hitting.<br />\nA look at individual statistics shows some interesting<br />\nthings. Martino and Lachance<br />\ncontinue to lead the Jays in<br />\nhitting with .381 and .400<br />\nbatting averages respectively. Al<br />\nVolk is also hitting a solid .320.<br />\nAnd while Bob Cardwell is<br />\nbatting only .151, he has been<br />\non base often, receiving twenty<br />\nbase on balls. Similarly, Whitney Burke has walked eighteen<br />\ntimes though he is batting .186.<br />\nThird on the team in walks is<br />\nBob Martino, who has 155 BB's<br />\nto go with his sixteen hits.<br />\nThe team plays home against Franklin and Marshall today<br />\nand travels to College Park on<br />\nMonday to face the tough<br />\nDivision I Terps.<br />\nTuesday, the team plays its<br />\nmost important games of the<br />\nseason, a doubleheader against<br />\nWidener. These two games may<br />\nvery well decide the MAC<br />\nSoutheast Conference. If the<br />\nteams split the doubleheader and<br />\nfinish the season tied for first,<br />\nthe Blue Jays would have the<br />\nhome field advantage for a one<br />\ngame playoff.<br />\n<br />\nfS&IVI<br />\nThe More &nousSide0<br />\nPART 3: SCUM & MANKIND<br />\ncuntfrom p. 17<br />\nYou really are scum, and I<br />\nreally do hate you. You know<br />\nwho I'm talking about, and if<br />\nyou don't know you so9n will<br />\nbecause everyone will tell you if<br />\nthey haven't done so yet.<br />\nI don't know why you did<br />\nit. The whole thing didn't make<br />\nany sense. You do go to a fine<br />\nschool and you supposedly had<br />\nto be pretty decent people to get<br />\nin here, but mistakes are made<br />\nand unfortunately you are One<br />\nof them.<br />\nHow could you do such a<br />\nthing? How could you be so<br />\nstupid?<br />\nTo make a special<br />\nmixture of alcohol you knew<br />\ndamn well would make a lot of<br />\npeople damn sick. But you<br />\ndidn't just make them sick, you<br />\ndamn near killed one person.<br />\nOh yeah, you might think it's all<br />\nfun and games, but if it weren't<br />\nfor some people who were there<br />\nat the right time, that person<br />\nmay not be alive today. So the<br />\nhell with you.<br />\nBut that's not all. You are<br />\nmembers of a fraternity here on<br />\ncampus and although it wasn't a<br />\nfrat party, you still do represent<br />\na fraternity. And your actions<br />\nwill be looked upon as such.<br />\nSome people complain about the<br />\nfrats. I never had and probably<br />\nnever will. Just because a few<br />\npeople decided it would, be fun<br />\nto see some partygoers get sick is<br />\nno reason to put down the frats.<br />\nSo how's it feel to be scum?<br />\n1 don't know. You tell me. You<br />\n<br />\nshould know by now. You<br />\nshould have known ever since<br />\nOr was it<br />\nSaturday night.<br />\nSunday morning'? I don't know.<br />\nmaybe you should tell me.<br />\nI don't remember anything after<br />\nyou gave me those shots. Those<br />\nvery special shots you practically<br />\nforced down a person's mouth.<br />\nBut I guess he was smart. He<br />\njust dumped it in the garbage.<br />\nHow's that? You didn't get<br />\neveryone you wanted to get. I<br />\nbet that really bothers you. Or<br />\ndoes it9<br />\n<br />\nSo much for the scum.<br />\nMaybe you'll change. But I<br />\ndoubt it. People seldom do after<br />\nthree years of college.<br />\nAnd what about those people that were there at the right<br />\ntime who cared for me? They're<br />\nthe mankind so different from<br />\nthe scum. But the only problem<br />\nis the scum usually outnumbers<br />\nmankind, and it's too bad that<br />\nonly the scum are ever singled<br />\nout as \"speck.] cases.\" It's really<br />\nthe other people, the real<br />\npeople. who are special.<br />\n<br />\n1,<br />\n77r.<br />\n<br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nFriday Saturday, April 23-24<br />\n.7.'stAf.:\" Team Champs .<br />\nMen's Tems .<br />\nPenn Rtlays<br />\nWI:Cs<br />\n<br />\n..<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nFriday Sunday,<br />\nWrqneri's Lax<br />\n,<br />\nSaturday, April 24<br />\nMen's Lax vs. Maryland homet7orrting)<br />\n<br />\n1-1<br />\n- \u2022 -- Pm is<br />\n<br />\nMonday.

Dean George Owen<br />\nwas apparently swept away with<br />\nenthusiasm by a popular Tommie Dorsey tune. The dean<br />\nreportedly had been sitting with<br />\na group of faculty on the lawn in<br />\nfront of Shriver Hall. The group<br />\nhad been there since 9:00 a.m.<br />\nand were seen consuming liberal<br />\namounts of mint juleps from a<br />\nten gallon ice cooler.<br />\nThe band finished playing at<br />\n1:30 p.m. with an upbeat<br />\nTommie Dorsey number and<br /><br />\nOwen was apparently enraged by<br />\ntheir refusal to play an encore.<br />\nHe threw his mint julep into the<br />\nface of the band leader and then<br />\nturned his anger on the innocent<br />\ncrowd.<br />\nHis first victim was seven<br />\nyear old Steven Lally who had<br />\nbeen dancing with his pregnant<br />\nmother on the macadam in front<br />\nof the stage. With one quick kick<br />\nof Owen's wing-tipped golfing<br />\nshoes the troy was pitched into<br />\nthe percussion section of the<br />\nAnything Goes band. Owen<br />\nthen . said, \"I want that baby and<br />\nI'm going to get it.\" A smile<br />\nslowly spread over Owen's face<br />\nas he picked up a tomahawk out<br />\nof the wicker picnic basket and<br />\nproceeded to chop the pregnant<br />\nwoman into small pieces.<br />\nSecurity was able to apprehend Owen before he reached<br />\nhis next victim, Franciscan nun<br />\ncarrying a guitar case.

For the last<br />\nthree months, Hurley has been<br />\nin constant fear for his life., lie<br />\nbelieves that someone is trying<br />\nto kill him.

At approximately<br />\n2:20 p.m. on Saturday, March<br />\n20, Hurley was chased through<br />\nFarragut Square by approximately 200 pigeons. Swooping<br /><br />\nand swerving, the pigeons tried<br />\nto remove Hurley's facial hair<br />\nand outer clothing, thus leaving<br />\nhim free to be attacked a la The<br />\nBirds.<br /><br />\nmaintain that Hurley provoked<br />\nthe birds by throwing coffee on<br />\nthem while walking through the<br />\nsquare.

Hopkins has come a long was since '72 when it<br />\nwas a little two-campus school with only Baltimore<br />\nto call home. Now Hopkins is a multi-faceted, multinational University.<br />\nThe early growth (Peabody, SAIS, APL) put<br />\nHopkins in the Ivy League League and made a strong<br />\nfoundation for the extensive work of the past decade.<br />\nThe expansion of the East Baltimore campus to include<br />\nthe School of Acupuncture and Faith Healing has<br />\nalmost doubled the revenues from that campus. Admission is highly selective, of course, but tuition is<br />\n535,000/year. I am quite pleased that after only seven<br />\nyears in existence, the School of Acupuncture .and<br />\nFaith Healing is considered the finest institution for<br />\nthe training of acupuncturists and faith healers in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\n1982 saw Hopkins make a giant step from an<br />\nAmerican University to an international education<br />\nnetwork. As the world got smaller and smaller, I found<br />\nit necessary that Hopkins get larger, until one day (I<br />\nestimate 1998) I expect they will converge and Hopkins will he synonymous with world education. Some<br />\nof the exchange campuses 1 have established include:<br />\nNanjing, China; Brazilia, Brazil; Hamburg, Germany;<br />\nTokyo, Japan; Sydney, Australia; the Falkland Islands;<br />\nHampton, Bermuda; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; Nice,<br />\nFrance;just to name a few. This network has kept me<br />\nI<br /><br />\nright on top of all the intellectual and tanning progress<br />\nmade in the world.<br />\n'82 was a definite landmark in the Hopkins<br />\ntransition. At that time Ronald Reagan was still<br />\npresident of the United States and I found the application of the new New Federalism particularly applicable<br />\nto the Hopkins situation. I decided at that point that,<br />\nto achieve greater growth, I had to decentralize the<br />\nadministration. Having a centralized administration,<br />\nespecially in Baltimore, seemed to be an inefficient<br />\nmethod of running the University. So 1 sent Michael<br />\nHooker to Bennington College to prepare for the<br />\neventual annexation of Bennington to Hopkins, forming the Bennington Campus for the Fine Arts. I<br />\ndecided to get rid of all the other remaining deans, as<br />\nthey really were only there for cocktail party purposes.<br />\nI, of course, kept Jakie Hall on as my special assistant<br />\nin charge of the international network and cocktail<br />\nparties, but otherwise I assumed singlehanded control<br />\nof the university.<br />\nAlso during the Reagan administration, Hopkins was given the responsibility of collecting federal<br />\nincome taxes, for as former president Reagan said:<br />\n\"Why should we maintain a federal government merely<br />\nfor the purpose of collecting taxes which we would<br />\nimmediately hand over the the Hopkins Applied<br />\nPhysics Lab for the military effort? It made much<br />\nmore sense to have Hopkins collect the money, develop<br />\nand build the defense equipment, and then run the<br />\n1<br /><br />\nPresident Muller, Dean Muller and Special Assistant Hall<br /><br />\narmed forces.\" When the federal government was at<br />\nlast disbanded, Reagan joined the Hopkins faculty as<br />\nhead of staff for the Applied Cosmetology Lab in<br />\nNantucket. I had always respected Mr. Reagan's fine<br />\nwork in the area of cosmetology and found him a great<br />\nasset to the institution.<br />\nOne of my greatest achievements at Hopkins<br />\nwas the creation of the Applied Biology Lab in 1984.<br />\nABL is directed by Dr. Kenneth Lynn, who earned a<br />\nsecond Ph.D. in Biology in order that he might take<br />\nthis position on the Virgin Islands. Lynn did a commendable job of making Muller clones to fill the<br />\nadministrative offices I had vacated, first in the initial<br />\npurge of '72, then again in '83. Although I had no<br />\ntrouble running the University singlehandedly, the lack<br />\nof administrators was a difficult problem,especially in<br />\nterms of scheduling lunch dates and News-Letter<br />\ninterviews.<br />\nIn my constant pursuit of ways to make the<br />\nUniversity more cost-efficient, I found that one good<br />\nway of trimming costs was to significantly alter the<br />\nundergraduate program. Undergraduates had originally<br />\nbeen accepted at the University in order that JHU<br />\nreceive University accreditation. We needed University<br />\nstatus in order to pull in the big government research<br />\nprojects, and our name was widely respected in the<br />\ncommunity (which made it easier to fix social science<br />\nstudies without raising anyone's suspicions). However,<br />\nit is not necessary to maintain 2000 undergrads in<br />\norder to keep our accreditation, and it was costing far<br />\nmore to educate the undergrads than they were bringing in in revenue. So I cut back the number of students accepted in each freshman class from 2000 to 10.<br />\nTen undergraduates really makes teaching far easier for<br />\nthe faculty, because they each only have to offer one<br />\ncourse every 15 years, instead of two or three per year.<br />\nThis means they can devote much more time to research, which means they pull in more grant money,<br />\nwhich means that Hopkins keeps getting bigger and<br />\nricher. Besides, undergraduates really litter the campus.<br />\nSince I instituted a program for precocious grad<br />\nstudents, we can not get 10 to 12 good years of research out of these kids before we have to send them<br />\nout into the University job market. This puts us miles<br />\nahead of our competitors. Harvard has really been<br />\nstruggling to stay afloat, even though we have been<br />\ngenerous enough to send them some of our best<br />\ngraduates.<br />\nLooking back over the past two decades I have<br />\nseen a lot of improvements. But I will not stop here.<br />\nThe future holds endless possibilities for the continued<br />\ngrowth and expansion of the Johns Hopkins family.<br /><br />\nKillFine Arts CampusIn Vermont<br />\n\"Frankly, I'm surprised he pulled it off.\"<br />\nMichael Hooker, Dean of the Johns Hopkins University's<br />\nFine Arts campus at Bennington, Vermont, tilted back<br />\nin his chair as he reflected on Steven Muller's successful<br />\ni-ansformation of Berinington\u2014just ten years ago a<br />\nhighly respected independent arts college\u2014into yet<br />\nanother thriving limb of that multifaceted, multinational<br />\norganism whose heart is located in Baltimore. \"It was all<br />\nconducted with the utmost of secrecy,\" Hooker continued. \"1 myself was unaware of the full extent of<br />\nMuller's intentions for me. But when he told me to<br />\nshave my mustache, I knew something was up.\"<br />\nSensing what he saw to be a \"need to have other,<br />\nmore non-science oriented feathers in our wide-brimmed<br />\nUniversity cap,\" President Muller acquired Bennington<br />\nin 1982, when he arranged the appointment of Hooker<br />\nto the presidency of the college. \"After that it was only<br />\na matter of time before Muller played his ace,\" Hooker<br />\nremembered. \"Needless to say, is came as quite a shock<br />\nto the existing Bennington staff.\"<br />\nThe \"ace\" Hooker refers to was the deployment.<br />\nof several thousand Muller clones (provided by the<br />\nUniversity's Applied Biology Lab) around the perimeter<br />\nof the Bennington campus, equipped with portable<br />\nbars and witty stories intended to entice the college's<br />\nlargely female population into demanding annexation.<br />\n\"They [the clones] won the women over immediately,\"<br />\nHooker said. \"The faculty had no choice but to relent\".<br />\nEverywhere now at Bennington can be seen the<br />\nresults of placement under the JHU banner of progress.<br />\nHappy Hopkins premeds, sent to Bennington to fulfill<br />\ndistribution requirements, wander wide-eyed, instilled<br />\nwith poetic spirit and joie de vivre. There is a 100-seat<br /><br />\nblack-box theater, named in honor of Mark Trachtenberg (Hopkins BA '81), where grainy prints of B-grade<br />\nmovies are shown with the sound turned all the way up.<br />\nEager Blue Jay lacrosse players sit cross legged anioni<br />\ndandelions and discuss linguistics with helpful Bennington coeds.<br />\nMeanwhile, on JHU's Homewood campus,similai<br />\nchanges are evident. Energetic professors of English an(<br />\ncreative writing imported from Bennington have showr<br />\nof the once-lauded John Barth for the mechanistic and<br />\nrepetitice poseur he had always been. The Rathskellar<br />\nhas been appropriated as a thrice-weekly forum for the<br />\nexchange of meaningful dialogue, good food, and<br />\nhonest, open sexual encounter. This change was spurred<br />\non in part by the influx of Bennington females at<br />\nHomewood, which served to balance out a formerly<br />\nlackluster male/female ration.<br />\n\"Yes, ration,\" Hooker said. \"We found that<br />\nmandatory frequent sex did m uch for<br />\nthe emotional well being of students on both sides of the arts-andsciences fence. It opened up the more naive Hopkins<br />\nmales, and made the more mature Bennington women<br />\naware ofjust how hard some people have it.\"<br />\nAnother major part of the Hopkins/Bennington<br />\nexchange was the hiring of Joseph Levine (Hopkins BA<br />\n'82) as Assistant Dean of Fine Arts. \"I kept getting<br />\nletters from Joe complaining about the poor attendance<br />\nat the yearly 'Kenan Awards ceremonies. They were<br />\nsigned 'A Really, Really Frustrated But Eager-to-be-ofAssistance Patron of the Arts.' I figured what the hell,<br />\nI'll hire him. It certainly beat selling frozen yogurt<br />\ndoor-to-door, which was what he had been doing.\"<br /><br />\nDean Levine's most vital contribution to the<br />\nUniversity was the creation of the Kenan Arts Festival, a<br />\nthree-day event held in a large pasture near Bennington.<br />\n\"We get about 150,000 people out a year,\" Hooker<br />\nsaid. \"They really support the arts up here.\"<br />\nThe highlight of each year's festival is the performance of Breastheating, a play Dean Levine himself<br />\nwrote as a postgraduate,about the gradual revelation of<br />\nlesbian tendencies between two seven-year-old girls<br />\nduring a wild night at Walt Disney World, Florida.<br />\n\"Levine always wants to get Joseph Papp to direct,<br />\nbecause he likes the ring of the name,\" Hooker recounted. The current staging, however, is by El. L. Gruman,<br />\none of off-off-Broadway's most prominent practitioners<br />\nof the Theater of Pretense.<br />\nHooker is pleased with the changes Muller and<br />\ncompany have effected in the past ten years. \"Steve has<br />\nbeen doing a great job,\" he said,\"My only hope is that<br />\nsomeday we'll be able to turn down the volume at the<br />\nTrachtenberg.\"<br /><br />\nThe happy, hippie Hooker<br /><br />\nMake-up Tests<br /><br />\nPrecocious Grad Students<br />\nUnder the beneficient twenty-year Muller regime.<br />\nnumerous modifications within the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity structure have created a unique institution of<br />\nhigher learning. Instead of the average university with<br />\nsubdivisions of undergraduate colleges and a program of<br />\ng,riduate studies, President Muller has &amp;emphasized<br />\nundergraduate studies and improved upon the graduate<br />\nprogram to a startling degree. By cutting back the<br />\nundergraduate population to a meager ten students.<br />\nMuller has been able to make major cuts in undergraduate services and apply the extra monies to other<br />\ngraduate programs.<br />\nPerhaps one of the most unusual programs<br />\ninitiated because of this abundance of funds is the<br />\nSchool for Precocious Children (SPC), a 526_4 niithon<br />\ncomplex situated on the site that once contained the<br />\nfreshman dorms. Completed in 1987, this addition to<br />\nHopkins graduate program deals exdusisely with the<br />\ntraining of precocious oriental grad students.<br />\nWith an average entrance age of five. the SPC is<br />\nan unprecedented school of higher learning_ Its ranks<br />\nare drawn from a program instituted by Dr_ Julian<br />\nStanley, noted psychologist and innovative researcher on<br />\nthe intellectually gifted child. Admission to the SPC is<br />\ndetermined by a battery of tests designed specifically in<br />\nmind for the school's youthful populace_ Little has been<br />\nrevealed as to the nature of these tests since they are<br />\nclassified to prevent program espionage, but SPC admissions director Steve Muller has admitted that \"we only<br />\ntake the youngest, the liveliest, the brightest leaning.of<br />\ncourse, toward the most mathematicallly and scientifically precocious.\"<br />\nWhen questioned on the steadily decreasing age<br />\nlevel of tstudents admitted to the program. Muller was<br />\nevasive. \"Well,\" he said. \"Um___no.\" The Dean of<br />\nGraduate Studies had a similar reaction. \"Well.\" he said.<br />\n\"Urn...no.\" Ditto for the Dean of Homewood Faculties,<br />\nDirector of Advising and Counseling, and Director of<br />\nGraduate Student Activities. Only the Provost. Dr_ S.<br />\nMuller, whose resemblance to President Steven Muller<br />\nis striking, had this to say: \"We at Hopkins are proud to<br />\noffer a unique educational opportunity to the precocious youth of our society. As the only true University<br />\ncommitted to advanced research, we are obligated to<br />\ncontinue in that great tradition. To do so, we must draw<br />\nfrom the ever-increasing ranks of precocious children as<br />\nthey are the lifebl(x)d of our society. At the moment.<br />\nour precocious children account for more than 20<br />\npercent of the total graduate student body. As to the<br />\npoint raised that the students seem to be getting younger. I can only point to the increasing mutancy rate<br />\namongst our New York State students_ due perhaps. to<br />\nthe simultaneous meltdown and combustion of the<br />\nstate's two nuclear reactors at Indian Point and Shoreham-Wading River some years ago. The majority of our<br />\nstudent body comes from the nearby eastern seaboard.<br />\nand it has become obvious that more and mote freaks<br />\nare being produced in these areas. Happily enough,they<br />\nare intellectual freaks, but freaks nonetheless_ That, of<br />\ncourse, is off the record.The News-Litter also spoke with Tsu Tan Konfour year old, second year grad student in the<br />\na<br />\n,<br />\nKlin<br />\nAnthropology department, and member of the GRO<br />\nJohnny, as he is known to friends, is a typical exampk<br />\nof the new Hopkins student. 7ZK:<br />\nTZK: I am told that my first words were Sinantiunpus<br />\npekinensis; no Mama or Papa for me.

The Falklands are in the unique<br />\nposition of being equidistant from the southern breeding ground of the Crudong penguins and the migration<br />\npath of the summer Bonnet Heads. The latest in<br />\ntechnological equipment. plus a team of international<br />\npenguin watchers and natural scientists, make the JHU<br />\nPenguin Observatory a stepping stone for natural<br />\nhistory. Johns Hopkins alone can't take all the credit<br />\nfor this southern phenomenon: it was Steve Muller<br />\nwho brought the Islands back, both economically and<br />\npolitically.<br />\nWhen former Secretary of State Alexander Haig<br />\ntook the Islands from Argentine-British hands in 1982<br />\nand put them in Muller's lap. it was like giving the Inner<br />\nHarbor to James Rouse. Muller knew just how to<br />\nrevitalize the area and make the islands productive.<br />\nAfter he cleaned up the nuclear spill left from the war,<br /><br />\n'he tried to find ways, to boost the Islands' faltering<br />\neconomy and low morale. His KOA Kammound<br />\ncampaign was just one way of bringing tourist dollars to<br />\nthe Falklands. Putting Johns Ilopkins money behind the<br />\nnow famous Falklands Hilton and Convention Center<br />\nwas another nice touch. The Falklands are being considered now as a possible site for the 1996 Olympics. The<br />\nMullerian Parliament, which governs the gentle, peaceloving people of the Falklands, has plans to finance a<br />\nsubway to mainland Argentina for the event. Perhaps<br />\nMuller's most successful venture in the South American<br />\nenterprise is his fast-food chain, featuring island delicacies like turtle tacos, penguin burgers, and Homewood<br />\nDeli-style fried sea urchins. Mr. Popper's can be found<br />\nall over the hemisphere, and is gaining popularity in<br />\nseveral major European cities.<br />\nAs far as the economic and political improvement of the Falkland Islands goes, the Penguin Observatory is just the beginning.

HOOK<br />\nIt was kind of a shock, and it<br />\ndidn't get much publicity, but Lawrence<br />\nOlivier was in town last week for a one<br />\nnight recreation of Hamlet. I got there a<br />\nlittle late because I had to argue with the<br />\nparking lot attendant outside who insisted on charging me even though I<br />\nexplained who I was. So I walked in and<br />\nfound out that Hamlet was the guy up<br />\nthere thinking about killing the guy who<br />\nkilled his father. He drove his girlfriend<br />\nOphelia to suicide and killed her father,<br />\nbut mostly he stands there and just kind<br />\nof thinks out loud. It all leads up to a<br />\nbloody last scene where Hamlet, his<br />\nuncle, hi4 mother, and his girlfriend's<br />\nbrother wind up dead, but I won't give<br />\naway how it happens because you might<br />\nwant to see it yourself.<br />\nLord Olivier (or Larry as he asked<br /><br />\nstage. I told him to call me Walt) was<br />\ncertainly loud enough, but I began to<br />\nwonder if it was his idea to dress in black<br />\nthe whole play. It struckme as overdoing<br />\nit a little. After all, Hamlet spends about<br />\n90 percent of his time bitching and<br />\nmoaning about death over and over again.<br />\nWe all know that death is mysterious and<br />\nfrightening and all that, but there are<br />\nonly so many ways to state the same idea<br />\nfor four hours. Of course this really isn't<br />\nOlivier's fault; the playwright seems<br />\nintent on focusing on the personal<br />\ntraumas of one member of the elite class<br />\nwith no social conscience for the way<br />\nthat these programs relate to the toiling<br />\nmasses. hamlet is a politically insensitive<br />\nplay, unlike, say, Julius Caesar, or<br />\nBlossius of Cumae.<br />\nThe lack of respect for the common man was glaring in the vulgar and<br />\npointless graveyard scene whose m<br /><br />\nBrainwashed crowds applaud Hook's review<br />\nobject is to laugh at the working stiffs and Polonius, who was just too short to<br />\nand show how they just get in the be convincing.<br />\nThe production had some remarkprince's way, but there was no questioning Hamlet's determination. Two ably inconsistent aspects. For one thing,<br />\nminutes later he kicked the gravediggers they kept saying that they were in<br />\noff the stage, preferring instead to talk Denmark, but they all spoke with English<br />\naccents and in archaic forms like this was<br />\nabout old times with a skull.<br />\nOphelia was also played by a very supposed to be impressive (Maybe the<br />\nstrong actress. However, they cast a very British think they still own Denmark as<br />\ndark, bosomy, bourgeoise feminist/actress well as Argentina).<br />\nOverall, the play had a strong<br />\ntype, not the type that find very attractive at all, which leads me to wonder who enough plot to carry it through, although<br />\nI thought it dragged a little in the first act<br />\nwas doing the casting.<br />\nThe rest of the cast played their when I found myself reading War and<br />\nparts well except for Rosencrantz, who Peace and discovering a novel new interwas awful and had a disgustingly big nose, pretation.

John finally<br />\ndecided he had to do something<br />\nabout his handicap. Heading<br />\ndown to Boston for a Red Sox<br />\ngame, he decided to visit the<br />\nCombat Zone instead. He went<br />\ninside what seemed to be a<br />\nreputable whorehouse and asked<br />\nfor a room. When the lady at<br />\nthe desk asked John if he had<br />\nany special requests, he didn't<br />\nknow what to say. After all,<br />\nJohn was just a naive kid from<br />\nRemembering someBangor.<br /><br />\nphoto courtesy Office of Student Services<br /><br />\nit. John quickly sprinted down<br />\nthe steps onto the streets of<br />\nBoston. \u2022<br />\nDriving near Faneuil Hall,<br />\nall of a sudden, an idea popped<br />\ninto John's head. Quickly, he<br />\ndrove to the nearest department<br />\nstore. It just had to work. It<br />\ncost only $25. a lot cheaper than<br />\nthe lady wearing a garter, belt.<br />\nHe started the long trek<br />\nback to Bangor, but halfway<br />\nthere, John decided he couldn't<br />\nwait any longer. He got off the<br />\nhighway and headed into a gas<br />\nstation with his purchase. lie<br />\nprayed there was an outlet in the<br />\nrestroom. Sure enough there<br />\nwas. John quickly plugged the<br /><br />\nclothing so having only one This was Nick's idea because<br />\ncloset between them isn't a Tom often has the urge to give<br />\nproblem. They usually don't eat consecutive shits, especially<br />\nin, so the kitchen is seldom used. when he has the runs.<br />\nAnd if they get constipated.<br />\nBut the one problem they do<br />\nonly time this occurs is<br />\nThe<br />\nthe<br />\nbathroom.<br />\nis<br />\nhave<br />\nduring Passover when they both<br />\nThere's only one toilet, one<br />\nget stuck. But it all conies out<br />\nsink and one shower. And both<br />\nm the end so they don't<br />\neven<br />\ncracked<br />\nare<br />\nsink<br />\nthe shower and<br />\nso they seldom wash their hands make any kind of compensation.<br />\nWith the contest only a<br />\nand take showers. That's why<br />\nold, Nick is leading by<br />\nmonth<br />\nthey<br />\nthey wear hats because<br />\ntwo shits. Two weeks ago Tom<br />\nnever wash 'their hair. But they<br />\nhad a commanding lead but Nick<br />\ndo shit a lot. Maybe that's why<br />\nsome bad cheese and pulled<br />\nate<br />\nthey're<br />\nwhen<br />\nthey only smell<br />\nahead. He was shining between<br />\nconstipated but that's seldom<br />\nthe case. As I said, they do shit four and five times a day while<br />\nTom was only averaging two or<br />\na lot.<br />\nShitting is relative and it three which is one above Nick's<br />\ndoes depend on the person and usual output. But enough of<br /><br />\nthis shit.<br />\nTom just got home from<br />\nschool, and the first thing he did<br />\nwas run to the bathroom, lay<br />\ndown his strips of toilet paper<br />\nand read the newspaper. And,<br />\nof course, well, you know what<br />\nhe did.<br />\nWhen he was about to get to<br />\nthe good part, Nick rushed into<br />\nthe partment and began to<br />\nscream and rant and rave. This<br />\nwas not the usual Nick. It think<br />\nhe really had to go this time.<br />\nHis pants weren't wet or damp<br />\nas far as I could tell. That<br />\nreminds me. Both Tom and<br />\nNick have tremendous control<br />\nwhen it comes to holding in<br />\ntheir shits and urinations, but<br />\nThey<br />\nespecially their shits.<br />\nreally don't care about their<br />\nurine because they don't mind<br />\nstrange urinals, but when it<br />\nconies to their shits, they refuse<br />\nto shit in any toilet besides their<br />\nown. \u2022<br />\nNick continued to yell for<br />\nthe next 15 minutes and at some<br />\npoints pleaded with Tom to<br />\nhurry it up.<br />\nTom refused and rightly so.<br />\nHe got to the toilet first, and the<br />\nrule was the first person to get<br />\nto the toilet owned full rights to<br />\nthe toilet for as long as he<br />\nwanted to sit on the toilet,<br />\nwhich, by the way, had a foam<br />\nseat that Tom bought two days<br />\nbefore the contest began.<br />\nWhile Nick was waiting to<br />\ndo whatever he had to do, which<br />\nmost,,, likely was a shit. he began<br />\npicking his nose which he did<br />\nwhenever he was nervous. He<br />\nwould sit down on his desk<br />\nchair, stick his first finger of his .<br />\nright hand (he never used his left<br />\nhand) up his right_ nostril and<br />\npull out a wad of mucus. He not<br />\nonly pulled it out, but he would<br />\nalso squeeze it around between<br />\nhis fingers until it became sticky<br />\nand manageable so he was able<br />\nto smell it. He did this for about<br />\nfive minutes before he switched<br />\nto his left nostril. It seemed<br />\nstrange but his right nostril<br />\nalways produced more. No one<br />\nknew why and Nick didn't want<br />\nto know as long as his supply<br />\nnever depleted. And when it<br />\ndid, he would go to his reserves<br />\nwhich he kept in his bottom<br />\ndesk drawer, which he only went _<br />\nto in extreme emergencies.

They then left Miami<br />\nand spent three days in the<br />\nBahamas for some sun and<br />\nrelaxation, which did not cost<br />\nany extra money because of the<br />\nplane package offered by Eastern.<br />\nThe post-seasonal trips are<br />\npaid for by gate sales for one<br />\ngame each year, and the program<br />\nsales, which amount to $7000The players<br />\n8000 a year,<br />\nare only required to pay for<br />\ntheir meals.<br />\n***<br />\nWhen Gary Rubert, who is<br />\nnow the Assistant Director of<br />\nAthletics at UMBC, arrived at<br />\nHopkins'to coach the basketball<br />\nteam in 1970, he was approached by then Athletic Director Marshall Turner.<br />\n\"Mr. Turner made it quite<br />\nclear that lacrosse had a high<br />\nimage at Hopkins and explained<br />\nto me the tradition,\" says<br />\nRubert. \"lie made certain that<br />\nGary Basketball would understand that he wouldn't get as<br />\nmany fans and as much press as<br />\nthe lacrosse team.\"<br />\nThings have not changed.<br /><br />\nLast Saturday the team<br />\nhosted Washington College for a<br />\ndouble-header. This was also the<br />\nteam's alumni day, with many<br />\nformer players returning for the<br />\nfestivities.<br />\nWashington College won the<br />\nfirst game 3-0. Their pitchers<br />\nlimited the Jays to 3 hits.<br />\nWashington took the lead in the<br />\ntop of the first. With one out, a<br />\nwalk and a triple gave Washington College its first run. The<br />\nsecond run scored when Bobby<br />\nRodrigues dropped the third<br />\nstrike and threw to first to retire<br />\nthe batter. The runner sneaked<br />\nhome as Rodrigues made the<br />\nplay at first.<br />\nThe Blue Jays threatened in<br />\nthe bottom of the fifth. They<br />\nloaded the bases on walks to<br />\nCardwell and Martino and a<br />\nRandy Greehan bunt single.<br />\nAndy Lachance, who was two<br />\nfor two up to this point, hit a<br />\nhard liner up the middle. The<br />\nWashington pitcher somehow<br />\nspeared it barehanded and threw<br />\nto first for a double play. Evan<br />\nLipsitz walked to load the bases<br />\nagain, but Whitney Burke ended<br />\nthe threat with a long fly out.<br />\nWashington added another<br />\nrun in the seventh to make the<br />\nfinal 3-0. Steve Hand pitched a<br />\nstrong game but a couple of bad<br />\npitches allowed Washington to<br />\nscore their runs.<br />\nDave Provost rebounded<br />\nfrom his first loss by allowing<br /><br />\nthe Washington team only 3 hits<br />\nin picking up his fifth victory.<br />\nHe also lowered his team-leading<br />\nearned run average to 2.14.<br />\nThe Jays broke the game<br />\nopen with six runs in the top of<br />\nWith one out, Bob<br />\nthe first.<br />\nMartino lead off with a single<br />\nand scored on Andy Lachance's<br />\ntriple. Lachance scored when<br />\nthe Washington defense threw<br />\nthe ball away. Al Volk then<br />\nwalked and stole second. He<br />\nscored on a double by Rusty<br />\nRay.<br />\nA Bill Miller double<br />\nfollowing a Doug Gneiser walk<br />\ndrove in two more. The sixth<br />\nrun scored when Tom Harmon's<br />\nsingle sent Miller home.<br />\nHopkins picked up five<br />\nmore in the fifth. Evan Lipsitz<br />\nsingled and walks to Gneiser and<br />\nMiller loaded the bases. The<br />\nthree scored on a triple by Tom<br />\nHarmon. Alan Heaton drove<br />\nHarmon home on a sacrifice fly.<br />\nThe Jays got one more on singles<br />\nby Lachance and Volk after a<br />\nwalk to Martino.<br />\nProvost lost his shut out in<br />\nthe sixth as Washington picked<br />\nup a run making the final score<br />\n11-1.<br />\nAs has been the case all<br />\nseason, the Jays were once again<br />\nAgainst<br />\nerratic this week.<br />\nWashington .the defense was<br />\nsuperb, committing only one<br />\nerror in the doubleheader. Yet<br />\nit was once again shoddy in the<br /><br />\nDickinson game. The hitting has<br />\nimproved as the team batting<br />\naverage is beginning to climb.<br />\nAs low as .236 a couple of weeks<br />\nago, it is now .244. The hitting<br />\nremains inconsistent. The team<br />\nscores in bunches, but they may<br />\ngo through long periods without<br />\nmuch hitting.<br />\nA look at individual statistics shows some interesting<br />\nthings. Martino and Lachance<br />\ncontinue to lead the Jays in<br />\nhitting with .381 and .400<br />\nbatting averages respectively. Al<br />\nVolk is also hitting a solid .320.<br />\nAnd while Bob Cardwell is<br />\nbatting only .151, he has been<br />\non base often, receiving twenty<br />\nbase on balls. Similarly, Whitney Burke has walked eighteen<br />\ntimes though he is batting .186.<br />\nThird on the team in walks is<br />\nBob Martino, who has 155 BB's<br />\nto go with his sixteen hits.<br />\nThe team plays home against Franklin and Marshall today<br />\nand travels to College Park on<br />\nMonday to face the tough<br />\nDivision I Terps.<br />\nTuesday, the team plays its<br />\nmost important games of the<br />\nseason, a doubleheader against<br />\nWidener. These two games may<br />\nvery well decide the MAC<br />\nSoutheast Conference. If the<br />\nteams split the doubleheader and<br />\nfinish the season tied for first,<br />\nthe Blue Jays would have the<br />\nhome field advantage for a one<br />\ngame playoff.<br /><br />\nfS&amp;IVI<br />\nThe More &amp;nousSide0<br />\nPART 3: SCUM &amp; MANKIND<br />\ncuntfrom p. 17<br />\nYou really are scum, and I<br />\nreally do hate you. You know<br />\nwho I'm talking about, and if<br />\nyou don't know you so9n will<br />\nbecause everyone will tell you if<br />\nthey haven't done so yet.<br />\nI don't know why you did<br />\nit. The whole thing didn't make<br />\nany sense. You do go to a fine<br />\nschool and you supposedly had<br />\nto be pretty decent people to get<br />\nin here, but mistakes are made<br />\nand unfortunately you are One<br />\nof them.<br />\nHow could you do such a<br />\nthing? How could you be so<br />\nstupid?<br />\nTo make a special<br />\nmixture of alcohol you knew<br />\ndamn well would make a lot of<br />\npeople damn sick. But you<br />\ndidn't just make them sick, you<br />\ndamn near killed one person.<br />\nOh yeah, you might think it's all<br />\nfun and games, but if it weren't<br />\nfor some people who were there<br />\nat the right time, that person<br />\nmay not be alive today. So the<br />\nhell with you.<br />\nBut that's not all. You are<br />\nmembers of a fraternity here on<br />\ncampus and although it wasn't a<br />\nfrat party, you still do represent<br />\na fraternity. And your actions<br />\nwill be looked upon as such.<br />\nSome people complain about the<br />\nfrats. I never had and probably<br />\nnever will. Just because a few<br />\npeople decided it would, be fun<br />\nto see some partygoers get sick is<br />\nno reason to put down the frats.<br />\nSo how's it feel to be scum?<br />\n1 don't know. You tell me. You<br /><br />\nshould know by now. You<br />\nshould have known ever since<br />\nOr was it<br />\nSaturday night.<br />\nSunday morning'? I don't know.<br />\nmaybe you should tell me.<br />\nI don't remember anything after<br />\nyou gave me those shots. Those<br />\nvery special shots you practically<br />\nforced down a person's mouth.<br />\nBut I guess he was smart. He<br />\njust dumped it in the garbage.<br />\nHow's that? You didn't get<br />\neveryone you wanted to get. I<br />\nbet that really bothers you. Or<br />\ndoes it9<br /><br />\nSo much for the scum.<br />\nMaybe you'll change. But I<br />\ndoubt it. People seldom do after<br />\nthree years of college.<br />\nAnd what about those people that were there at the right<br />\ntime who cared for me? They're<br />\nthe mankind so different from<br />\nthe scum. But the only problem<br />\nis the scum usually outnumbers<br />\nmankind, and it's too bad that<br />\nonly the scum are ever singled<br />\nout as \"speck.] cases.\" It's really<br />\nthe other people, the real<br />\npeople. who are special.<br /><br />\n1,<br />\n77r.<br /><br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nFriday Saturday, April 23-24<br />\n.7.'stAf.:\" Team Champs .<br />\nMen's Tems .<br />\nPenn Rtlays<br />\nWI:Cs<br /><br />\n..<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nFriday Sunday,<br />\nWrqneri's Lax<br />\n,<br />\nSaturday, April 24<br />\nMen's Lax vs. Maryland homet7orrting)<br /><br />\n1-1<br />\n- \u2022 -- Pm is<br /><br />\nMonday.
