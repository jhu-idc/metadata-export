What light does<br />\nmodern astronomy cast on this<br />\nsubject? What is its population?<br />\nHas it any canals?<br />\nMr. Frederick Brackett of the<br />\nphysics department will bring the<br />\nlatest views on this subject before<br />\nthe Scientific Club on Thursday at<br />\n12.30 P. M. in Room 2, Gilman<br />\nHall.<br />\nMr. Brackett has been solar observer at Mt. Wilson Observatory,<br />\nwhere he was intimately associated<br />\nwith Dr. Hale. He is at present<br />\nassociated with Dr. Pfund in spectroscopic research. During the<br />\nwar Mr. Brackett was called to<br />\nWashington, where he was connected with the Bureau of Weights<br />\nand Standards. His work there<br />\nwas a great success. His specialty<br />\nis in optics, in which line his colleagues acknowledge that he will<br />\nbe an important factor in the<br />\nfuture. He will present to the<br />\nclub the latest astronomical views<br />\nand scientific theories on the subject of the day. This lecture will<br />\nprobably be the most interesting<br />\nof any that the club has had so<br />\nfar,, because of the competence of<br />\nthe' lecturer and of his ability to<br />\npresent difficult subjects in a popular form.

Laidler<br />\non the Monday before examinations on \"Guild Socialism.\" Dr.<br />\nLaidler gave a very interesting<br />\nsynopsis of the development of<br />\nSocialism from its earliest days up<br />\nto the present time. The first<br />\nschool of Socialism was the Utopian, then came the Marxian school<br />\nwith its communist manifesto, followed by the German revisionists<br />\nand the syndicalists, who believed<br />\nin the abolition of the political<br />\nstate and a new society to be<br />\nformed by direct action of the<br />\nworkers. The fifth great school is<br />\nthat of Guild Socialism.<br />\nThe followers of this branch of<br />\nSocialism believe in the ownership'<br />\nof industry by the State with management in the hands of the intellectual and manual workers who<br />\nare to be formed in local, sectional<br />\nand national guilds. This, according to Dr. Laidler, is \"a reaction<br />\nagainst State Socialism and to<br />\nsome extent against syndicalism.\"<br />\nGuild Socialists believe in preserving the political state while according the workers complete management of all industry. This,<br />\nthey declare, necessary to give<br />\nlabor a respectability and responsibility which the present system<br />\nof wages, by making manual<br />\nworkers a commodity, can never<br />\ngive. The people as consumers<br />\nwould have a voice concerning<br />\nproducts and prices to prevent<br />\ntheir exploitation by the guilds.<br />\nThe officers in industry, such as<br />\nforemen, are to be elected directly<br />\nby the workers, which plan is expected to give more efficiency than<br />\nour own, since no one will be eligible for election who has not passed<br />\nan examination set by some outside agency. One great danger,<br />\nDr. Laidler said, is that society<br />\nwill come to regard production<br />\nand not consumption as the great<br />\nhuman ultimate.<br />\nThe lecture was well attended<br />\nand the subject was clearly and<br />\nlucidly set forth by the speaker.<br />\nAfter his talk Dr, Laidler answered a number of questions on<br />\na great many aspects of the subject.<br />\nTime and Again.<br />\n<br />\nHe\u2014May I hold your hand for a<br />\nsecond?<br />\nShe\u2014How will you know when<br />\nthe second is up?<br />\nHe\u2014Oh,I'll need a second hand<br />\nfor that\u2014Brown Jug (Brown<br />\nUniversity).<br />\nTeacher\u2014Some terrible things<br />\ncan be caught from kissing.<br />\nBobby\u2014Right!

Laidler<br />\non the Monday before examinations on \"Guild Socialism.\" Dr.<br />\nLaidler gave a very interesting<br />\nsynopsis of the development of<br />\nSocialism from its earliest days up<br />\nto the present time. The first<br />\nschool of Socialism was the Utopian, then came the Marxian school<br />\nwith its communist manifesto, followed by the German revisionists<br />\nand the syndicalists, who believed<br />\nin the abolition of the political<br />\nstate and a new society to be<br />\nformed by direct action of the<br />\nworkers. The fifth great school is<br />\nthat of Guild Socialism.<br />\nThe followers of this branch of<br />\nSocialism believe in the ownership'<br />\nof industry by the State with management in the hands of the intellectual and manual workers who<br />\nare to be formed in local, sectional<br />\nand national guilds. This, according to Dr. Laidler, is \"a reaction<br />\nagainst State Socialism and to<br />\nsome extent against syndicalism.\"<br />\nGuild Socialists believe in preserving the political state while according the workers complete management of all industry. This,<br />\nthey declare, necessary to give<br />\nlabor a respectability and responsibility which the present system<br />\nof wages, by making manual<br />\nworkers a commodity, can never<br />\ngive. The people as consumers<br />\nwould have a voice concerning<br />\nproducts and prices to prevent<br />\ntheir exploitation by the guilds.<br />\nThe officers in industry, such as<br />\nforemen, are to be elected directly<br />\nby the workers, which plan is expected to give more efficiency than<br />\nour own, since no one will be eligible for election who has not passed<br />\nan examination set by some outside agency. One great danger,<br />\nDr. Laidler said, is that society<br />\nwill come to regard production<br />\nand not consumption as the great<br />\nhuman ultimate.<br />\nThe lecture was well attended<br />\nand the subject was clearly and<br />\nlucidly set forth by the speaker.<br />\nAfter his talk Dr, Laidler answered a number of questions on<br />\na great many aspects of the subject.<br />\nTime and Again.<br /><br />\nHe\u2014May I hold your hand for a<br />\nsecond?<br />\nShe\u2014How will you know when<br />\nthe second is up?<br />\nHe\u2014Oh,I'll need a second hand<br />\nfor that\u2014Brown Jug (Brown<br />\nUniversity).<br />\nTeacher\u2014Some terrible things<br />\ncan be caught from kissing.<br />\nBobby\u2014Right!
