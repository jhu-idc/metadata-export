First, and<br />\nforemost, I would encounter little (if<br />\nany) opposition to the fact that<br />\nthere are many and important weaknesses and inconsistencies in the<br />\nelections. The Student council president;--whether -3ecogiuzed ..or<br />\nholds on the basis of a school-wide<br />\nelection the most important position<br />\non the campus, and yet the percentage tignout for the class presidential<br />\nelections, which everyone admits to<br />\neoe practically honorary positions, exceeds that of the Council presidential<br />\nelection. I have found, also, machine<br />\npolitics ruling in most elections: engineers voting for straight engineering tickets, fraternity groups voting<br />\nstraight tickets, and smaller groups<br />\nsupporting nominees on conventional<br />\nor customary bases.<br />\nconspicuous weakness<br />\nAnother<br />\nshows itself particularly well in the<br />\nrecent 'Student Council Amendments balloting- when most Of the<br />\nballots, whether expressing consent<br />\nor opposition, were turned in without many students questioning or investigating the action at all. The<br />\nCouncil was in favor of this action.<br />\nIt wanted student opinion and even<br />\napproval; but it wanted the kind of<br />\napproval that indicates an understanding and recognition of the<br />\ncauses and effects of _this important<br />\nrevision in student government.<br />\nWhy is it that the class officers<br />\nhave been so relatively inactive? My<br />\nanswer to this question would be that<br />\nbecause they are not elected according to ability, character, or even<br />\npotentialities. Popularity does, and<br />\nshould to an extent, influence elec-1<br />\ntion.s. But there are other qualifies,'<br />\ntions which deserve even more consideration. Some of these are the<br />\nambitiomsness oil .the candidates, the<br />\nactive interest they have shown, and<br />\ntheir willingness to work for their.<br />\nown class, at least.<br />\nFactionalism, departmental antagonism, and childish displays of<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nLetter To Box 1 *<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor, the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nAt' the beginning of the year you<br />\ncriticized the Student council as a<br />\nwhole atid its president in particular.<br />\nThus far the Student council has<br />\nproven that you were mistaken in<br />\nthat criticism.

Erie<br />\nJohnston,<br />\npresident of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, from a<br />\n16,000 mile airplane tour of seven<br />\nLatin American countries brings to<br />\nlight once more the amazing truth<br />\nabout American business psychology:<br />\nits ability to see what it wants in spite<br />\nof tho facts.<br />\nMr Johnson visited Argentina,<br />\nwhere only shrewd political management. has kepi the conservatives in<br />\noffice against an undoubtedly leftist<br />\npublic opinion; Brazil, where there<br />\nhas been a definitely favorable popular 'reaction to President Vargas'a<br />\npolicy of state aid to and control of<br />\nbusiness; and Chile and Uraguay, in<br />\nboth of which the radical partieshave<br />\nrecently won elections by Rooseveltian majorities. His conclusion: There<br />\nis a 'tremendous interest' on the part<br />\nOf tall classes of South Americans in<br />\nthe .free enterprise system.

First, and<br />\nforemost, I would encounter little (if<br />\nany) opposition to the fact that<br />\nthere are many and important weaknesses and inconsistencies in the<br />\nelections. The Student council president;--whether -3ecogiuzed ..or<br />\nholds on the basis of a school-wide<br />\nelection the most important position<br />\non the campus, and yet the percentage tignout for the class presidential<br />\nelections, which everyone admits to<br />\neoe practically honorary positions, exceeds that of the Council presidential<br />\nelection. I have found, also, machine<br />\npolitics ruling in most elections: engineers voting for straight engineering tickets, fraternity groups voting<br />\nstraight tickets, and smaller groups<br />\nsupporting nominees on conventional<br />\nor customary bases.<br />\nconspicuous weakness<br />\nAnother<br />\nshows itself particularly well in the<br />\nrecent 'Student Council Amendments balloting- when most Of the<br />\nballots, whether expressing consent<br />\nor opposition, were turned in without many students questioning or investigating the action at all. The<br />\nCouncil was in favor of this action.<br />\nIt wanted student opinion and even<br />\napproval; but it wanted the kind of<br />\napproval that indicates an understanding and recognition of the<br />\ncauses and effects of _this important<br />\nrevision in student government.<br />\nWhy is it that the class officers<br />\nhave been so relatively inactive? My<br />\nanswer to this question would be that<br />\nbecause they are not elected according to ability, character, or even<br />\npotentialities. Popularity does, and<br />\nshould to an extent, influence elec-1<br />\ntion.s. But there are other qualifies,'<br />\ntions which deserve even more consideration. Some of these are the<br />\nambitiomsness oil .the candidates, the<br />\nactive interest they have shown, and<br />\ntheir willingness to work for their.<br />\nown class, at least.<br />\nFactionalism, departmental antagonism, and childish displays of<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nLetter To Box 1 *<br /><br />\nTo the Editor, the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nAt' the beginning of the year you<br />\ncriticized the Student council as a<br />\nwhole atid its president in particular.<br />\nThus far the Student council has<br />\nproven that you were mistaken in<br />\nthat criticism. In fact, it has become<br />\nthe mostlictive councils that I have<br />\nkeen in three years at Hopkins.<br />\nNow the Student council is attempt to amend the constitution and<br />\ncreate the Honor commission. This<br />\naction necessitated a stirfetreterekendum with at least 50% of the student body casting ballots. Of course<br />\nsuch a referendum must be publicized<br />\nbefore the day the voting is to take<br />\nplace. It was the understanding of<br />\nthe Student council that the NEWSLETTER was to provide this publicity<br />\nin the form of a two Or three column<br />\nheadline article explaining the necessity for the action.<br />\nInstead it was given a very unattractive one coltium head of 'Election to be held tomorrow,' containing only one of the many reasons for<br />\nthe action, and most of the article<br />\nbeing a listing of facts which any<br />\nintelligent person could have obtained -from reading the amendment.<br />\nThis heading could certainly not attract much attention on a campus<br />\nthat was election weary already. An<br />\narticle under this head would appear to the casual reader, especially<br />\nthe freshman, as an announcenient<br />\nof the forthcoming freshman elec\u2022<br />\ntions.<br />\nIt seems that it would not have<br />\ntaken any important space to give<br />\nthis a more interesting two column<br />\nhead.
