HOffman kicked three field goals for<br />\nthe Black and Blue, the boots coming at time's when Hopkins needed<br />\nthe Points; while Brooks displayed<br />\nan aggressiveness on both the offensive and defensive, w h i cli<br />\nmarked him as the star of the contest.<br />\nIt was probably the best showing made by the team, as a whole,<br />\nSO far this season. Although<br />\nthe lineup was somewhat changed,<br />\nthe Black and Blue eleven played<br />\nas a unit, breaking up the plays<br />\nof Gettysburg at will. In this respect, Leibensperger and Wilkinson played their usual strong game,<br />\nWhile the work of Schmidt and<br />\n.Gorman showed material improvement.<br />\nThe game started promptly at<br />\n3 P. M. The weather was ideal in<br />\nevery respect and a large crowd<br />\nwas on hand. Several hundred<br />\nGettysburg rooters with an improvised band occupied the west<br />\nstand and helped to make things<br />\nlively.<br />\nNeither team scored during the<br />\nfirst quarter, the ball remaining for<br />\nthe most part in the middle of the<br />\nfield, with both sides punting frequently. However, it was during<br />\nthis period that Hoffman made his<br />\nfirst attempt at a field goal. The<br />\nPass from the center was high and<br />\nBobby was forced to get the ball off<br />\nquickly, with the result that it<br />\nmissed the uprights by a few inches.<br />\nIn the second quarter, Hoffman<br />\nmade two successful kicks. The<br />\nfirst goal was probably the most<br />\nh air-raising feature of the game.<br />\nAfter Gettysburg had lost the ball<br />\nOn downs,<br />\nHopkins advanced to the,<br />\nvisitors' 40-yard line, due to the<br />\nSplendid work of Brooks and Bowers. Hoffman then made his first<br />\nscore. The pass was again high<br />\nand the ball was necessarily kicked<br />\nquickly. It struck the right-hand<br />\nUpright, bounded back to the crossbar and finally flopped over, much<br />\nto the joy of Hopkins rooters.<br />\nTwo minutes later, Hoffman rePeated his performance from GettYsburg's 35-yard line\u2014this time<br />\nthe ball going over cleanly. The<br />\nhalf ended with the score: Hopkins,<br />\n6; Gettysburg, o.<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nBy COACH CHARLES E. BRICKLEY<br />\n<br />\nThe Juniors proved at Homewood last Friday that they had not<br />\nbeen over bold in their sweeping<br />\nchallenge to the combined forces of<br />\nthe rest of the University, when<br />\nthey overwhelmed their opponents<br />\nto the tune of 56 to 16. The meet<br />\nhad to be postponed from Wednesday to Friday on account of the<br />\ncold weather, and when it did take<br />\nplace many of those who had signified their intention of taking part<br />\nwere detained in laboratories and<br />\nby other engagements, so that the<br />\nnumber of contestants was not as<br />\nlarge as had been expected. There<br />\nwere, however, enough entries in<br />\nevery event to make good contests,<br />\nand the primary purpose of the<br />\nmeet\u2014to bring out the ability of<br />\nthe various men early in the year\u2014<br />\nwas successfully accomplished.<br />\nThe meet formed a fitting conclusion to the outdoor fall practice,<br />\nwhich has been carried on upon a<br />\nmuch larger scale this year than<br />\never before at Hopkins, and it is<br />\nthe idea of those who proposed<br />\nthe plan to have a fall track meet<br />\nbecome an annual affair and build<br />\nit up to become a much more hotly<br />\ncontested affair in years to come.<br />\nThere is no question as to the advantage of fall work in building<br />\nup athletes, and a meet as a conclusion to the practices forms a goal<br />\nto work toward.<br />\nThe squad will now enjoy a rest<br />\nuntil work begins in the cage early<br />\nin December, With the exception<br />\nof the cross-country men.

Goodnow before an unusually large audience at the Academy of Music. The lecture was<br />\nthe first of a series to be delivered<br />\nby noted men, arranged by the<br />\nWomen's Civic League and the<br />\nMunicipal Art Society, acting with<br />\nthe University.<br />\nMayor Preston presided and, on<br />\nintroducing Dr. Goodnow, he spoke<br />\nappreciatively of the advantage to<br />\nthe community in having such an authority upon governmental and administrative problems in the city,<br />\nwho is taking such an active interest in its development and progress.<br />\nPresident Goodnow began his lecture by expressing his hesitancy in<br />\nspeaking before the Mayor, who had<br />\nhad practical experience in city government, while he could only offer<br />\nan academic study of the development and problems of municipal<br />\ngovernment. Until Napoleon III<br />\nand Baron Hausman undertook<br />\nthe improvement of Paris little had<br />\nbeen done, he said, in bettering municipal conditions, but that example<br />\nwas followed swiftly by both Great<br />\nBritain and Germany, so that by the<br />\nend of the nineteenth century a<br />\ntransformation had been wrought<br />\nin the cities of Europe. Dr. Albert<br />\nShaw, a graduate of Hopkins, was<br />\nthe first to direct the attention of<br />\nthe American people to the municipal problem.<br />\n<br />\nShowing a decided improvement<br />\nin almost every department of play,<br />\nHopkins was able to defeat Gettysburg 23 to 7 on Saturday last.<br />\nAlthough the latter team was without the services of one or two of<br />\nher best men, the visitors presented<br />\na strongly-balanced team, which<br />\nplayed intelligent football throughout.<br />\nThe value of the kicking game<br />\nwas shown Saturday, for it was<br />\nmainly through the superior punting game on the part of Hopkins<br />\nthat the ball was placed within scoring distance, and once a fumbled<br />\npunt was converted into a Hopkins'<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nHopkins showed a pleasing tendency to follow the ball on Saturday, a feature which was lacking<br />\na week ago. A team which follows the ball well is bound to get<br />\nmost of the breaks in its favor<br />\nsooner or later.<br />\nPerhaps the weakest department<br />\nof Hopkins play was the interference, or better, the lack of it. The<br />\nHopkins men do not seem to want<br />\nto leave their feet to dive at an<br />\nopponent in order to take him out<br />\nof the play. Good interference is<br />\none of the fundamental essentials of<br />\nfootball and the Hopkins team, as<br />\na whole, must learn to do it much<br />\nbetter if we are to get successful<br />\nresults in these last three games.<br />\nOutside of the punting, the offensive strength of the two teams<br />\nwas very nearly equal. Hopkins was<br />\nstronger on defense, but not so<br />\nmuch more so as to tell very heavily<br />\nin its favor. The equality of the<br />\ntwo teams made the result of the<br />\ngame a question of which team<br />\nwould break under the strain. At<br />\nthe beginning of the second half it<br />\nlooked as if Hopkins had broken<br />\nwhen Gettysburg ran back a punt<br />\nfor a touchdown, the kicked goal<br />\nfrom which put them ahead, 7 to 6.<br />\nBut this setback seemed to be just<br />\nthe stimulus that the Hopkins team<br />\nneeded, for from that time on their<br />\nplay improved steadily until in the<br />\nfourth quarter; when the team<br />\nshowed its best football of the year.<br />\nSaturday's contest proved that<br />\nthe Hopkins team could fight, that<br />\nthey could play under pressure and<br />\nthat they could come from behind<br />\nand win. It also showed the value<br />\nof good substitutes, for without them<br />\nHopkins couldn't have won the<br />\ngame.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 1)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nThe above photograph shows Brooks crossing Swarthmore's goal line for<br />\nHopkins' first touchdown in the game at Homewood on October 30.<br />\nThe exposure was made just as the ball went over the line.\u2014Photografthed esfiecially for The News-Letter by L.

It is with sincere regret that the Council declined contests with these institutions, but the policy of holding only<br />\ntwo debates a year, and those in<br />\nthe triangular league with North<br />\nCarolina and Virginia, has been so<br />\nsuccessful in the past that it was<br />\nthought to be unwise to undertake<br />\nany new contests, however attractive they might seem.<br />\nNegotiations with North Carolina and Virginia with reference to<br />\nthe continuance of the league has<br />\nalready been begun, although there<br />\nis practically no doubt that the<br />\nthree-sided contest will take place<br />\nthis year, and that the arrangement<br />\nof last year, to all intents and purposes, will remain unchanged.<br />\nHowever, if any unforeseen reason should prevent the league from<br />\nbeing formed this year, Hopkins<br />\nwould have no trouble in arranging<br />\ndebates with any of the universities<br />\nfrom whom it has received challenges. It is probable that if it were<br />\nto become necessary to change the<br />\ndebating schedule, the choice of antagonists would fall either upon<br />\nWashington and Lee, with whom<br />\nHopkins has enjoyed cordial relations in the past, or upon the New<br />\nOrleans institution.<br />\nThe Council has organized for<br />\nthe year with Mr. Harrison Coffin, '16, as president, and Mr.<br />\nAlexander Steinbach, '17, as secretary. A committee consisting of<br />\nMr. Weech, '17, chairman; Mr.<br />\nTingley, '16; and Mr. Oppenheimer, '18, has been appointed to<br />\nchoose a subject for Hopkins to<br />\nsubmit to North Carolina and<br />\nVirginia.<br />\nThe date of the inter-class debate for this year has been set for<br />\nJanuary 28, and efforts will be<br />\nmade to hold the triangular debate on or near April 1. In this<br />\nway the two will not conflict and<br />\nabundant time will be allowed for<br />\npreparation.<br />\nAnother proof of the growth of<br />\nHopkins' reputation in debate is<br />\nthe fact that it has been prominently mentioned in the last Intercollegiate Debate Book. Its record<br />\nof two consecutive victories over<br />\nboth its opponents is alluded to,<br />\nand the agreement between North<br />\nCarolina, Virginia and Hopkins is<br />\ngiven in full.<br />\n<br />\nThe Junior Class meeting, which<br />\nwas held at Homewood last Tuesday afternoon, was the first class<br />\nmeeting that had ever been held<br />\nat Homewood. The juniors will<br />\ncontinue to have their class meetings at Homewood, as a motion to<br />\nthis effect was passed at the first<br />\nmeeting of the 1917 Class this year.<br />\nThe first part of the meeting was<br />\ndevoted to the election of the<br />\njunior officers of the Engineering<br />\nSociety. The seniors elect the<br />\npresident and the treasurer of the<br />\nsociety, while the juniors elect the<br />\nvice-president and the secretary.<br />\nThompson was elected vice-president and Binford was chosen as<br />\nsecretary.<br />\nThe committee which was appointed to make nominations for<br />\nthe Hullabaloo Board nominated<br />\nthirty men. Twelve men were<br />\nelected to the board, no specifications being made as to the particular positions they are to hold. The<br />\nmen elected will meet shortly and<br />\nchoose an editor-in-chief, a business manager and men for the other<br />\npositions on the board. The twelve<br />\nelected were Binford, Thompson,<br />\nDefandorf, Straus, Stuart, Baker,<br />\nHall, Paul Sutton, Weech, Fulton,<br />\nBoyce and Owings.<br />\nMr. Tingley, editor-in-chief of<br />\nthe 1916 Hullabaloo, then addressed<br />\nthe meeting. He said that this<br />\nyear's class-book was going to be<br />\nbetter and more original than any<br />\nHullabaloo that had ever been published and that he hoped the 1917<br />\nbook would be even better. He<br />\nconcluded his address by asking all<br />\nthe juniors to buy a copy of the<br />\n1916 Hullabaloo.<br />\nAfter President Stuart appointed<br />\na committee consisting of Boyce<br />\n(chairman), Straus and Thompson<br />\nto get up a good class flag, the<br />\nmeeting adjourned.<br />\n<br />\nCALIFORNIANS VISIT CITY<br />\nAccompanied by Hopkins Committee,<br />\nPrize-winning Farmer Boys From<br />\nGolden State Spend Day in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\n<br />\nAccompanied by Mr. J. Collin<br />\nVincent, of the Baltimore Chamber<br />\nof Commerce, and by a committee of four Hopkins undergraduates, twenty-nine agricultural students from California spent last<br />\nThursday in seeing points of interest in and about Baltimore, in<br />\ninspecting the farming country of<br />\nthe Green Spring Valley and in<br />\nvisiting the Sparks Agricultural<br />\nSchool of Sparks, Md. The California men, who are all prize winners in an agricultural contest held<br />\nannually in their State, are engaged<br />\nin a month's tour of the East and<br />\ncame to Baltimore directly from<br />\nNew York.<br />\nThe Hopkins committee which<br />\nhelped to entertain the visitors consisted of E.

After<br />\nluncheon had been served at the<br />\nlatter institution by the members<br />\nof the domestic science class, a<br />\nbasket-ball game took place between<br />\nthe visitors and the team of the<br />\nMaryland school, the California<br />\nmen being defeated by a rather<br />\nstartling score.

Though some of<br />\nthe new men do not as yet know<br />\nthe songs, they have been sung<br />\npretty well;'and the yelling has<br />\nbeen remarkably good these last<br />\nfew weeks. It might be suggested,<br />\nhowever, that instead of singing<br />\nsome of our \"ancient\" rag-time<br />\nsongs, the cheer leader try out one<br />\nof those good Hopkins songs-like<br />\nStollenwerck's or \"We're Here to<br />\nWin Again, Hopkins.\" They are<br />\ndistinctively our own and the music has a new sound to the bystanders.

No attempt to solve the problems of a particular city,\" Dr.<br />\nGoodnow continued, \"which does<br />\nnot take into account its peculiar<br />\nconditions will be successful. Many<br />\nsuggestions May be- derived from<br />\na consideration of the conditions<br />\nof other cities, but any attempt to<br />\nadopt in a wholesale manner ,instir<br />\ntutions which have met with success under other conditions is liable<br />\nto be followed by a very small<br />\nmeasure of success or even by positive failure.\"<br />\nDr. Goodnow next discussed the<br />\nevolution of the form of municipal<br />\ngovernment during the last century.<br />\nHe told of the original council system, adopted from England but<br />\nmodified by universal suffrage,<br />\nwhere the council was elected, and<br />\nthe mayor also, unless appointed by<br />\nthe governor. Its development into<br />\nthe board system was traced, with<br />\nits dissipation of responsibility and<br />\ndenial of popular control. Later<br />\nthere came, said Dr. Goodnow, the<br />\nperiod in which the power of the<br />\nmayor was expanded greatly, which<br />\ntended toward a larger concentration of power. The main objection to the \"mayor system\" is its<br />\ntendency to dislocate the entire municipal government at every mayoralty election.<br />\nThe most recent form of city<br />\ngovernment is that which lodges the<br />\npower in a commission of five elected<br />\nmembers, each of whom has under.<br />\nhis control some particular branch of<br />\nthe administration. Substantially,<br />\nthis is the old \"council system.\" It<br />\nis significant, Dr. Goodnow observed, that after a century of<br />\nchange America should return to<br />\nthe council system, 'to which Great<br />\nBritain has adhered all the while<br />\nwith success. \"Good city government,\" Dr. Goodnow concluded,<br />\n\"will result from the successful<br />\nadaptation of municipal institutions<br />\nto local conditions.\"<br />\nWasn't Seeing Things.<br />\n<br />\nElectric Trains EVERY HALF HOUR<br />\nBetween<br />\nBALTIMORE (Camden Station)<br />\nand ANNAPOLIS<br />\nShortest, Quickest Ind Most Direct Route<br />\n<br />\nANNAPOLIS SHORT LINE<br />\nAdams Drug Company<br />\nCIGARS, SODA<br />\nAND CANDY<br />\nHoward and Monument Streets<br />\n<br />\nThe artist was painting\u2014sunset,<br />\nred, with blue streaks and green<br />\ndots.

Have you seen the<br />\nlambent flame of dawn leaping<br />\nacross the livid East; the redstained, sulphurous islets floating iri<br />\nthe lake of fire in the West; the<br />\nragged clouds at midnight, black as<br />\nraven's wing, blotting out the shuddering moon?\"<br />\n\"No,\" replied the rustic shortly,<br />\n\"not since I signed the pledge.\"<br />\n<br />\nShortly after the opening of the<br />\nsecond half came Gettysburg's lone<br />\ntouchdown.

However, it was shortly<br />\nafter this that Hoffman kicked his<br />\nthird field goal, making the score<br />\n9 to 7 in favor of Hopkins.<br />\nIn the fourth quarter Gettysburg proved easy, Hopkins scoring<br />\ntwo touchdowns during that period.<br />\nThe first was due to the excellent<br />\nline plunging of Brooks and the<br />\nheadwork of Bowers, while the second was made by Eggie Gorman,<br />\nwho recovered a punt which Rowe<br />\nfumbled on his own 3-yard line.<br />\nWilkinson kicked goal on both occasions.<br />\nThe lineup and summary:<br />\nGettysburg.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nEmanuel<br />\nLE<br />\nFulton<br />\nCraig<br />\nLT<br />\nWilkinson<br />\nDulebohn<br />\n.L.

HOffman kicked three field goals for<br />\nthe Black and Blue, the boots coming at time's when Hopkins needed<br />\nthe Points; while Brooks displayed<br />\nan aggressiveness on both the offensive and defensive, w h i cli<br />\nmarked him as the star of the contest.<br />\nIt was probably the best showing made by the team, as a whole,<br />\nSO far this season. Although<br />\nthe lineup was somewhat changed,<br />\nthe Black and Blue eleven played<br />\nas a unit, breaking up the plays<br />\nof Gettysburg at will. In this respect, Leibensperger and Wilkinson played their usual strong game,<br />\nWhile the work of Schmidt and<br />\n.Gorman showed material improvement.<br />\nThe game started promptly at<br />\n3 P. M. The weather was ideal in<br />\nevery respect and a large crowd<br />\nwas on hand. Several hundred<br />\nGettysburg rooters with an improvised band occupied the west<br />\nstand and helped to make things<br />\nlively.<br />\nNeither team scored during the<br />\nfirst quarter, the ball remaining for<br />\nthe most part in the middle of the<br />\nfield, with both sides punting frequently. However, it was during<br />\nthis period that Hoffman made his<br />\nfirst attempt at a field goal. The<br />\nPass from the center was high and<br />\nBobby was forced to get the ball off<br />\nquickly, with the result that it<br />\nmissed the uprights by a few inches.<br />\nIn the second quarter, Hoffman<br />\nmade two successful kicks. The<br />\nfirst goal was probably the most<br />\nh air-raising feature of the game.<br />\nAfter Gettysburg had lost the ball<br />\nOn downs,<br />\nHopkins advanced to the,<br />\nvisitors' 40-yard line, due to the<br />\nSplendid work of Brooks and Bowers. Hoffman then made his first<br />\nscore. The pass was again high<br />\nand the ball was necessarily kicked<br />\nquickly. It struck the right-hand<br />\nUpright, bounded back to the crossbar and finally flopped over, much<br />\nto the joy of Hopkins rooters.<br />\nTwo minutes later, Hoffman rePeated his performance from GettYsburg's 35-yard line\u2014this time<br />\nthe ball going over cleanly. The<br />\nhalf ended with the score: Hopkins,<br />\n6; Gettysburg, o.<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nBy COACH CHARLES E. BRICKLEY<br /><br />\nThe Juniors proved at Homewood last Friday that they had not<br />\nbeen over bold in their sweeping<br />\nchallenge to the combined forces of<br />\nthe rest of the University, when<br />\nthey overwhelmed their opponents<br />\nto the tune of 56 to 16. The meet<br />\nhad to be postponed from Wednesday to Friday on account of the<br />\ncold weather, and when it did take<br />\nplace many of those who had signified their intention of taking part<br />\nwere detained in laboratories and<br />\nby other engagements, so that the<br />\nnumber of contestants was not as<br />\nlarge as had been expected. There<br />\nwere, however, enough entries in<br />\nevery event to make good contests,<br />\nand the primary purpose of the<br />\nmeet\u2014to bring out the ability of<br />\nthe various men early in the year\u2014<br />\nwas successfully accomplished.<br />\nThe meet formed a fitting conclusion to the outdoor fall practice,<br />\nwhich has been carried on upon a<br />\nmuch larger scale this year than<br />\never before at Hopkins, and it is<br />\nthe idea of those who proposed<br />\nthe plan to have a fall track meet<br />\nbecome an annual affair and build<br />\nit up to become a much more hotly<br />\ncontested affair in years to come.<br />\nThere is no question as to the advantage of fall work in building<br />\nup athletes, and a meet as a conclusion to the practices forms a goal<br />\nto work toward.<br />\nThe squad will now enjoy a rest<br />\nuntil work begins in the cage early<br />\nin December, With the exception<br />\nof the cross-country men.

The lecture was<br />\nthe first of a series to be delivered<br />\nby noted men, arranged by the<br />\nWomen's Civic League and the<br />\nMunicipal Art Society, acting with<br />\nthe University.<br />\nMayor Preston presided and, on<br />\nintroducing Dr. Goodnow, he spoke<br />\nappreciatively of the advantage to<br />\nthe community in having such an authority upon governmental and administrative problems in the city,<br />\nwho is taking such an active interest in its development and progress.<br />\nPresident Goodnow began his lecture by expressing his hesitancy in<br />\nspeaking before the Mayor, who had<br />\nhad practical experience in city government, while he could only offer<br />\nan academic study of the development and problems of municipal<br />\ngovernment. Until Napoleon III<br />\nand Baron Hausman undertook<br />\nthe improvement of Paris little had<br />\nbeen done, he said, in bettering municipal conditions, but that example<br />\nwas followed swiftly by both Great<br />\nBritain and Germany, so that by the<br />\nend of the nineteenth century a<br />\ntransformation had been wrought<br />\nin the cities of Europe. Dr. Albert<br />\nShaw, a graduate of Hopkins, was<br />\nthe first to direct the attention of<br />\nthe American people to the municipal problem.<br /><br />\nShowing a decided improvement<br />\nin almost every department of play,<br />\nHopkins was able to defeat Gettysburg 23 to 7 on Saturday last.<br />\nAlthough the latter team was without the services of one or two of<br />\nher best men, the visitors presented<br />\na strongly-balanced team, which<br />\nplayed intelligent football throughout.<br />\nThe value of the kicking game<br />\nwas shown Saturday, for it was<br />\nmainly through the superior punting game on the part of Hopkins<br />\nthat the ball was placed within scoring distance, and once a fumbled<br />\npunt was converted into a Hopkins'<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nHopkins showed a pleasing tendency to follow the ball on Saturday, a feature which was lacking<br />\na week ago. A team which follows the ball well is bound to get<br />\nmost of the breaks in its favor<br />\nsooner or later.<br />\nPerhaps the weakest department<br />\nof Hopkins play was the interference, or better, the lack of it. The<br />\nHopkins men do not seem to want<br />\nto leave their feet to dive at an<br />\nopponent in order to take him out<br />\nof the play. Good interference is<br />\none of the fundamental essentials of<br />\nfootball and the Hopkins team, as<br />\na whole, must learn to do it much<br />\nbetter if we are to get successful<br />\nresults in these last three games.<br />\nOutside of the punting, the offensive strength of the two teams<br />\nwas very nearly equal. Hopkins was<br />\nstronger on defense, but not so<br />\nmuch more so as to tell very heavily<br />\nin its favor. The equality of the<br />\ntwo teams made the result of the<br />\ngame a question of which team<br />\nwould break under the strain. At<br />\nthe beginning of the second half it<br />\nlooked as if Hopkins had broken<br />\nwhen Gettysburg ran back a punt<br />\nfor a touchdown, the kicked goal<br />\nfrom which put them ahead, 7 to 6.<br />\nBut this setback seemed to be just<br />\nthe stimulus that the Hopkins team<br />\nneeded, for from that time on their<br />\nplay improved steadily until in the<br />\nfourth quarter; when the team<br />\nshowed its best football of the year.<br />\nSaturday's contest proved that<br />\nthe Hopkins team could fight, that<br />\nthey could play under pressure and<br />\nthat they could come from behind<br />\nand win. It also showed the value<br />\nof good substitutes, for without them<br />\nHopkins couldn't have won the<br />\ngame.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 1)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 2)<br /><br />\nThe above photograph shows Brooks crossing Swarthmore's goal line for<br />\nHopkins' first touchdown in the game at Homewood on October 30.<br />\nThe exposure was made just as the ball went over the line.\u2014Photografthed esfiecially for The News-Letter by L.

It is with sincere regret that the Council declined contests with these institutions, but the policy of holding only<br />\ntwo debates a year, and those in<br />\nthe triangular league with North<br />\nCarolina and Virginia, has been so<br />\nsuccessful in the past that it was<br />\nthought to be unwise to undertake<br />\nany new contests, however attractive they might seem.<br />\nNegotiations with North Carolina and Virginia with reference to<br />\nthe continuance of the league has<br />\nalready been begun, although there<br />\nis practically no doubt that the<br />\nthree-sided contest will take place<br />\nthis year, and that the arrangement<br />\nof last year, to all intents and purposes, will remain unchanged.<br />\nHowever, if any unforeseen reason should prevent the league from<br />\nbeing formed this year, Hopkins<br />\nwould have no trouble in arranging<br />\ndebates with any of the universities<br />\nfrom whom it has received challenges. It is probable that if it were<br />\nto become necessary to change the<br />\ndebating schedule, the choice of antagonists would fall either upon<br />\nWashington and Lee, with whom<br />\nHopkins has enjoyed cordial relations in the past, or upon the New<br />\nOrleans institution.<br />\nThe Council has organized for<br />\nthe year with Mr. Harrison Coffin, '16, as president, and Mr.<br />\nAlexander Steinbach, '17, as secretary. A committee consisting of<br />\nMr. Weech, '17, chairman; Mr.<br />\nTingley, '16; and Mr. Oppenheimer, '18, has been appointed to<br />\nchoose a subject for Hopkins to<br />\nsubmit to North Carolina and<br />\nVirginia.<br />\nThe date of the inter-class debate for this year has been set for<br />\nJanuary 28, and efforts will be<br />\nmade to hold the triangular debate on or near April 1. In this<br />\nway the two will not conflict and<br />\nabundant time will be allowed for<br />\npreparation.<br />\nAnother proof of the growth of<br />\nHopkins' reputation in debate is<br />\nthe fact that it has been prominently mentioned in the last Intercollegiate Debate Book. Its record<br />\nof two consecutive victories over<br />\nboth its opponents is alluded to,<br />\nand the agreement between North<br />\nCarolina, Virginia and Hopkins is<br />\ngiven in full.<br /><br />\nThe Junior Class meeting, which<br />\nwas held at Homewood last Tuesday afternoon, was the first class<br />\nmeeting that had ever been held<br />\nat Homewood. The juniors will<br />\ncontinue to have their class meetings at Homewood, as a motion to<br />\nthis effect was passed at the first<br />\nmeeting of the 1917 Class this year.<br />\nThe first part of the meeting was<br />\ndevoted to the election of the<br />\njunior officers of the Engineering<br />\nSociety. The seniors elect the<br />\npresident and the treasurer of the<br />\nsociety, while the juniors elect the<br />\nvice-president and the secretary.<br />\nThompson was elected vice-president and Binford was chosen as<br />\nsecretary.<br />\nThe committee which was appointed to make nominations for<br />\nthe Hullabaloo Board nominated<br />\nthirty men. Twelve men were<br />\nelected to the board, no specifications being made as to the particular positions they are to hold. The<br />\nmen elected will meet shortly and<br />\nchoose an editor-in-chief, a business manager and men for the other<br />\npositions on the board. The twelve<br />\nelected were Binford, Thompson,<br />\nDefandorf, Straus, Stuart, Baker,<br />\nHall, Paul Sutton, Weech, Fulton,<br />\nBoyce and Owings.<br />\nMr. Tingley, editor-in-chief of<br />\nthe 1916 Hullabaloo, then addressed<br />\nthe meeting. He said that this<br />\nyear's class-book was going to be<br />\nbetter and more original than any<br />\nHullabaloo that had ever been published and that he hoped the 1917<br />\nbook would be even better. He<br />\nconcluded his address by asking all<br />\nthe juniors to buy a copy of the<br />\n1916 Hullabaloo.<br />\nAfter President Stuart appointed<br />\na committee consisting of Boyce<br />\n(chairman), Straus and Thompson<br />\nto get up a good class flag, the<br />\nmeeting adjourned.<br /><br />\nCALIFORNIANS VISIT CITY<br />\nAccompanied by Hopkins Committee,<br />\nPrize-winning Farmer Boys From<br />\nGolden State Spend Day in<br />\nBaltimore.<br /><br />\nAccompanied by Mr. J. Collin<br />\nVincent, of the Baltimore Chamber<br />\nof Commerce, and by a committee of four Hopkins undergraduates, twenty-nine agricultural students from California spent last<br />\nThursday in seeing points of interest in and about Baltimore, in<br />\ninspecting the farming country of<br />\nthe Green Spring Valley and in<br />\nvisiting the Sparks Agricultural<br />\nSchool of Sparks, Md. The California men, who are all prize winners in an agricultural contest held<br />\nannually in their State, are engaged<br />\nin a month's tour of the East and<br />\ncame to Baltimore directly from<br />\nNew York.<br />\nThe Hopkins committee which<br />\nhelped to entertain the visitors consisted of E.

After<br />\nluncheon had been served at the<br />\nlatter institution by the members<br />\nof the domestic science class, a<br />\nbasket-ball game took place between<br />\nthe visitors and the team of the<br />\nMaryland school, the California<br />\nmen being defeated by a rather<br />\nstartling score.

Phone<br /><br />\nANNAPOLIS SHORT LINE<br /><br />\nThe municipal problem is not only<br />\nmodern, but is in a large degree<br />\npeculiar to each city. \"The peculiarity depends upon the general social and economic conditions of the<br />\ncountry in which the city is located; upon the geographical position of the city; upon the population and local conditions of the<br />\ncity. No attempt to solve the problems of a particular city,\" Dr.<br />\nGoodnow continued, \"which does<br />\nnot take into account its peculiar<br />\nconditions will be successful. Many<br />\nsuggestions May be- derived from<br />\na consideration of the conditions<br />\nof other cities, but any attempt to<br />\nadopt in a wholesale manner ,instir<br />\ntutions which have met with success under other conditions is liable<br />\nto be followed by a very small<br />\nmeasure of success or even by positive failure.\"<br />\nDr. Goodnow next discussed the<br />\nevolution of the form of municipal<br />\ngovernment during the last century.<br />\nHe told of the original council system, adopted from England but<br />\nmodified by universal suffrage,<br />\nwhere the council was elected, and<br />\nthe mayor also, unless appointed by<br />\nthe governor. Its development into<br />\nthe board system was traced, with<br />\nits dissipation of responsibility and<br />\ndenial of popular control. Later<br />\nthere came, said Dr. Goodnow, the<br />\nperiod in which the power of the<br />\nmayor was expanded greatly, which<br />\ntended toward a larger concentration of power. The main objection to the \"mayor system\" is its<br />\ntendency to dislocate the entire municipal government at every mayoralty election.<br />\nThe most recent form of city<br />\ngovernment is that which lodges the<br />\npower in a commission of five elected<br />\nmembers, each of whom has under.<br />\nhis control some particular branch of<br />\nthe administration. Substantially,<br />\nthis is the old \"council system.\" It<br />\nis significant, Dr. Goodnow observed, that after a century of<br />\nchange America should return to<br />\nthe council system, 'to which Great<br />\nBritain has adhered all the while<br />\nwith success. \"Good city government,\" Dr. Goodnow concluded,<br />\n\"will result from the successful<br />\nadaptation of municipal institutions<br />\nto local conditions.\"<br />\nWasn't Seeing Things.<br /><br />\nElectric Trains EVERY HALF HOUR<br />\nBetween<br />\nBALTIMORE (Camden Station)<br />\nand ANNAPOLIS<br />\nShortest, Quickest Ind Most Direct Route<br /><br />\nANNAPOLIS SHORT LINE<br />\nAdams Drug Company<br />\nCIGARS, SODA<br />\nAND CANDY<br />\nHoward and Monument Streets<br /><br />\nThe artist was painting\u2014sunset,<br />\nred, with blue streaks and green<br />\ndots. The old rustic, at a respectful distance, was watching.<br />\n\"Ah,\" said the artist, looking up<br />\nsuddenly, \"perhaps to you, too, nature has opened her sky-pictures<br />\npage by page? Have you seen the<br />\nlambent flame of dawn leaping<br />\nacross the livid East; the redstained, sulphurous islets floating iri<br />\nthe lake of fire in the West; the<br />\nragged clouds at midnight, black as<br />\nraven's wing, blotting out the shuddering moon?\"<br />\n\"No,\" replied the rustic shortly,<br />\n\"not since I signed the pledge.\"<br /><br />\nShortly after the opening of the<br />\nsecond half came Gettysburg's lone<br />\ntouchdown. Rowe caught a punt<br />\non his own 45-yard line and by<br />\nclever dodging carried the ball fiftyfive Tards for a touchdown. Stoney<br />\nkicked goal.<br />\nHopkins rooters were now much<br />\ndepressed with the score against<br />\nthem. However, it was shortly<br />\nafter this that Hoffman kicked his<br />\nthird field goal, making the score<br />\n9 to 7 in favor of Hopkins.<br />\nIn the fourth quarter Gettysburg proved easy, Hopkins scoring<br />\ntwo touchdowns during that period.<br />\nThe first was due to the excellent<br />\nline plunging of Brooks and the<br />\nheadwork of Bowers, while the second was made by Eggie Gorman,<br />\nwho recovered a punt which Rowe<br />\nfumbled on his own 3-yard line.<br />\nWilkinson kicked goal on both occasions.<br />\nThe lineup and summary:<br />\nGettysburg.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nEmanuel<br />\nLE<br />\nFulton<br />\nCraig<br />\nLT<br />\nWilkinson<br />\nDulebohn<br />\n.L.
