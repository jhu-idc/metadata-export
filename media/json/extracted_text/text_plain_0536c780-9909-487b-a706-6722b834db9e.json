With<br />\none game under their belts, the Cavaliers will have a decided advantage<br />\nover the Blue Jays in respect to<br />\ngame experience; but one must not<br />\nforget that the Jays are playing on<br />\nhome grounds, thereby making both<br />\nteams pretty even.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Bob Lyons hasn't disclosed<br />\nany lineup, but it is almost certain<br />\nthat (Capt) Briggs, Gwynn, and<br />\nDunlop will be at their old positions<br />\non the forward line; Six and Hoopes<br />\nat two of the halfback slots, and<br />\nFrank Butt at the goal.

'Tis a burning<br />\nquestion I'll admit, but I don't think<br />\nit's too hot to handle. Last year,<br />\nprobably our biggest weakness was<br />\nan inability to call the proper play<br />\nat the proper time. This was most<br />\nevident in the Allegheny game, when<br />\nrepeatedly, after working the ball<br />\ndown within our opponents 15 yard<br />\nline by line bucks, we switched to<br />\noff tackle plays and end runs, and<br />\nas a result, we didn't score and lost<br />\nthe game, 6 to 0.<br />\nThis year, however, we have an<br />\nexperienced football star calling the<br />\nsignals in the person of Charles<br />\nRudo. Rudo made All-Maryland last<br />\nyear, and was every ounce of his<br />\n165 pounds a truly great ball player.<br />\nAnd all signs indicate that he'll be<br />\nbetter than ever this year, and it's<br />\nbecoming a saying at Homewood, \"as<br />\nRudo goes, so goes Hopkins.\"<br />\n<br />\nAnd not only will he be driving<br />\nharder in his runs, but his kicking<br />\nhas improved, if possible, and his<br />\npassing is 100% more accurate. A<br />\nlot of Hopkins' success this year depends on Spilman; probably more<br />\nthan most people realize, and you<br />\ncan bet your boots he'll surprise a<br />\nlot of us this fall\u2014this fighting<br />\nSpilman.<br />\n<br />\ndunhill's<br />\ngreenmouni at 33rd<br />\nA Smart<br />\nShop For<br />\nUniversitm<br />\nMen<br />\nHAVING<br />\nNATIONALLY<br />\nKNOWN<br />\nMEN'S WEAR<br />\nINCLUDING<br />\nARROW<br />\nSHIRTS<br />\n\u20181.<br />\n<br />\n\\\\WU&<br />\nNEW<br />\nLzrow Shirts with Arrow Collars<br />\nDesigned for Undergraducites<br />\nWINDSOR TAB<br />\nOf English origin, high lock end band,<br />\nsquare cornered collar.

Mr<br />\nLawrence's column of October 6 is<br />\nbasically of that nature. The very<br />\nclich\u00e9s which he uses, are more<br />\nthan faintly reminiscent of the stock<br />\nphrases used by some of the most<br />\nblatantly chauvinistic groups in the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nI agree with evaluating the position<br />\nof the United States in \"a peaceless<br />\nworld\" and I have no sympathy with<br />\nthat group which minimizes the<br />\nchances for America's entrance into<br />\nthe war, merely because the idea is<br />\nrepugnant to them.<br />\nBut I balk, when Mr Lawrence<br />\npops up and tells me in his column,<br />\nthat in view of the situation it is my<br />\nduty to join the ROTC. There must<br />\nbe a more sensible method of considering this problem which lies between Mr Lawrence's call to service,<br />\nand the brilliantly useless advice of<br />\nthe editor\u2014\"to keep well-informed<br />\nbut draw no conclusions\". As University students, the information<br />\nwhich we may obtain will not be of<br />\nsufficient value, perhaps, to write<br />\nan objective history of the present<br />\nsituation; nevertheless our education<br />\nhas fitted us with better tools to<br />\ncomprehend the situation than are<br />\npossessed by a far larger proportion<br />\nof the population. Because of this I<br />\nfeel that we should try to do more<br />\nthan keep well-informed. We should<br />\nnot be afraid to draw conclusions if<br />\nwe have studied the situation in the<br />\nlight of available knowledge.<br />\nTo return to Mr Lawrence's claims:<br />\nI do not feel that it is his province<br />\nto inform other people as to what<br />\ntheir duty is in such brazen terms.<br />\nIn a democracy, the duty of (he<br />\ncitizen to the state, especially in<br />\npeacetime is definitely a matter of individual conviction, so long as the<br />\nindividual does not transgress the<br />\nlaws.

That the<br />\ndistant dream as Mr Lawrence so<br />\nsententiously puts it, may be true;<br />\nbut at least it is a prophecy with<br />\nmuch evidence to the contrary. Nor<br />\ndo I accept without serious question<br />\nhis categorical statement that \"our<br />\nnavy is too brittle to be relied on\",<br />\nand \"that only in land armies can<br />\nthere be lasting strength and permanent military power.\" These are questions of fact that Mr Lawrence may<br />\nhave the answer to ,but there is a<br />\nlarge margin for difference of opinion.<br />\nFinally, I think that Mr Lawrence<br />\nis guilty of a fundamental inconsistency in his whole article. In the<br />\nopening paragraph he states, \"A<br />\nnation cannot be truly peaceful when<br />\ninternational affairs are being settled by force or threats instead of<br />\nreason and justice.\" However, he<br />\ncloses his article with the statement<br />\nthat \"no policy, however wise and upright can succeed unless it is backed<br />\nby force.\" If we are to assume then<br />\nthat Mr Lawrence believes in the<br />\nequal validity of those two statements, then the only conclusion to<br />\nbe drawn from his column is that he<br />\nbelieves that regardless of any<br />\nethics that nations may try to live<br />\nup to in the future, in their international relations, there will always<br />\nbe war, because of the necessary use<br />\nof force. If this is to be considered<br />\nas a permanent phenomenon then<br />\nwar will be eternal and talk of justice<br />\nwill be an eternal farce . . .

It must be admitted that<br />\nan independent, a non-fraternity man,<br />\nhas his best opportunity for political<br /><br />\nchine really wanted to utilize the<br /><br />\n.1?<br /><br />\nmal doings<br /><br />\nwhich<br /><br />\nmight<br /><br />\npowers of proxy voting.<br />\nIn allowing it in yesterday's election, the council has reinstated a<br />\ncampus evil which most Hopkin men<br />\nthought had been stowed away for<br />\ngood.<br />\nIt is evident that they have acted<br />\nwith a minimum of judgment and<br />\na maximum of haste, to say nothing<br />\nof any political maneuvers which<br />\nmight have been foremost in some<br />\nof their minds.<br />\nThe present council ought stop<br />\nand take inventory of both tradition<br />\nand logical, honest procedure.<br /><br />\nthink Mr Lawrence deserves to forfeit all the respect which, formerly,<br />\nhe may have deserved.<br />\nThere is no lower order of journalism than that type of propaganda<br />\nwhich pretends to deal with a social<br />\nquestion by appealing to the emotional reactions of its audience. Mr<br />\nLawrence's column of October 6 is<br />\nbasically of that nature. The very<br />\nclich\u00e9s which he uses, are more<br />\nthan faintly reminiscent of the stock<br />\nphrases used by some of the most<br />\nblatantly chauvinistic groups in the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nI agree with evaluating the position<br />\nof the United States in \"a peaceless<br />\nworld\" and I have no sympathy with<br />\nthat group which minimizes the<br />\nchances for America's entrance into<br />\nthe war, merely because the idea is<br />\nrepugnant to them.<br />\nBut I balk, when Mr Lawrence<br />\npops up and tells me in his column,<br />\nthat in view of the situation it is my<br />\nduty to join the ROTC. There must<br />\nbe a more sensible method of considering this problem which lies between Mr Lawrence's call to service,<br />\nand the brilliantly useless advice of<br />\nthe editor\u2014\"to keep well-informed<br />\nbut draw no conclusions\". As University students, the information<br />\nwhich we may obtain will not be of<br />\nsufficient value, perhaps, to write<br />\nan objective history of the present<br />\nsituation; nevertheless our education<br />\nhas fitted us with better tools to<br />\ncomprehend the situation than are<br />\npossessed by a far larger proportion<br />\nof the population. Because of this I<br />\nfeel that we should try to do more<br />\nthan keep well-informed. We should<br />\nnot be afraid to draw conclusions if<br />\nwe have studied the situation in the<br />\nlight of available knowledge.<br />\nTo return to Mr Lawrence's claims:<br />\nI do not feel that it is his province<br />\nto inform other people as to what<br />\ntheir duty is in such brazen terms.<br />\nIn a democracy, the duty of (he<br />\ncitizen to the state, especially in<br />\npeacetime is definitely a matter of individual conviction, so long as the<br />\nindividual does not transgress the<br />\nlaws. The moral obligations of any<br /><br />\nOF<br /><br />\nSOCIAL<br /><br />\nnot<br /><br />\ndetermined by the con-<br /><br />\nvictions of anyone individual in that<br />\ngroup, and utterances<br /><br />\nman a draft-dodger because his concepts of obligation differ from yours<br />\nis, under present circumstances, a<br />\npure slander.<br />\nIn the second place, some of the<br />\ngeneralizations which Mr. Lawrence<br />\nlays down as matters of fact are<br />\nfuture resurrection of peace is but a<br />\ncertainly open to question. That the<br />\ndistant dream as Mr Lawrence so<br />\nsententiously puts it, may be true;<br />\nbut at least it is a prophecy with<br />\nmuch evidence to the contrary. Nor<br />\ndo I accept without serious question<br />\nhis categorical statement that \"our<br />\nnavy is too brittle to be relied on\",<br />\nand \"that only in land armies can<br />\nthere be lasting strength and permanent military power.\" These are questions of fact that Mr Lawrence may<br />\nhave the answer to ,but there is a<br />\nlarge margin for difference of opinion.<br />\nFinally, I think that Mr Lawrence<br />\nis guilty of a fundamental inconsistency in his whole article. In the<br />\nopening paragraph he states, \"A<br />\nnation cannot be truly peaceful when<br />\ninternational affairs are being settled by force or threats instead of<br />\nreason and justice.\" However, he<br />\ncloses his article with the statement<br />\nthat \"no policy, however wise and upright can succeed unless it is backed<br />\nby force.\" If we are to assume then<br />\nthat Mr Lawrence believes in the<br />\nequal validity of those two statements, then the only conclusion to<br />\nbe drawn from his column is that he<br />\nbelieves that regardless of any<br />\nethics that nations may try to live<br />\nup to in the future, in their international relations, there will always<br />\nbe war, because of the necessary use<br />\nof force. If this is to be considered<br />\nas a permanent phenomenon then<br />\nwar will be eternal and talk of justice<br />\nwill be an eternal farce . . . I hesitate, however, to draw this conclusion<br />\nfrom Mr Lawrence's column, because<br />\nthose words have been too often uttered by one whose role in Europe<br />\ntoday is far from peaceful .<br />\nAdolph Hitler.<br />\nE Oppenheimer, '41<br /><br />\nBIRELY'S PHARMACYI<br />\nSt. Paul at 33rd St.<br />\nHopkins Men Welcome<br />\nLunches Served Quickly<br /><br />\nmark on the<br />\nARROW clip<br />\nmeans<br />\nGuaranteed<br />\nfor Life<br /><br />\nNearest To The Campus<br /><br />\nParker Pens And Pencils<br />\nJewelry and Watches<br />\nEyes Examined<br /><br />\n\"I WAS FILLED WITH ACID<br />\n(FERRIC CHLORIDE) INSTEAD<br />\nOF INK, WROTE WITH IT<br />\nALL DAY- A 5 MILE LINEAND IM STILL IN PERFECT<br />\nWORKING ORDER!\"<br /><br />\nPet-li 4;1<br />\n,<br />\n4<br /><br />\nTELEVISION<br /><br />\nLens Repaired<br /><br />\n3222 Greenmount Ave.<br /><br />\n\"I WAS NEARLY EATEN<br />\n/N TWO BY THIS SAME<br />\nACID \u2014WILL SOMEBODY<br />\n\\PLEASE CALL A DOCTOR!\"<br /><br />\nACTIVITIES<br /><br />\nPRESENTS<br /><br />\nThe First of its Fall Series of Dances<br />\nWITH<br /><br />\nBILLY ISAAC &amp; HIS COMMANDERS<br /><br />\nGUARANTEED<br />\nfor LIFE.<br /><br />\nAT THE<br /><br />\nBack To School Dance<br />\nOCTOBER 14, 1939<br />\nLEVERING HALL<br /><br />\nThkollege Favorite by2to I<br /><br />\n9- 1<br />\n50c PER PERSON<br /><br />\nMORE FUN FROM SCHOOL WITH THE B.
