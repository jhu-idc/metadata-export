D.<br />\n<br />\nThe demands of scholarship were never<br />\nharder and higher than they are today. The<br />\nera of specialties is upon us. A man to count<br />\nmust be an authority in his department, and<br />\nthis invcdves an element of competition, as well<br />\nas concentration, unparalleled in other days.<br />\nBecause of this specializing, men are apt to<br />\nunderestimate the value of straight college<br />\ntraining uninfluenced by a professional outlook. 1 believe that college is for the whole<br />\nman rather than the specialized scholar, for the<br />\ndisciplining of his mind, for the concentration<br />\nof attention, with moral as well as mental results, for the culture which puts one in touch<br />\nwith the world's thoughts and achievements,<br />\nthat multiplies his sympathies and widens his<br />\nhorizon, that teaches a man where to find the<br />\nproper tools of intellectual life and how to use<br />\nthem.<br />\nAs far as possible the peril of specializing in<br />\nthe college course should be avoided. To know<br />\nmuch of any one thing involves intentional<br />\nignorance of a great many others. The intentional ignorance should not be too great. Here<br />\nis the function of the college in giving a foundation for a specialty. If the Washington<br />\nmonument had a foundation no wider than it,<br />\nown base, it would be a perilous affair. if<br />\nyou know your calling in advance, do not imperil it by a too sympathetic choice of electives<br />\nin the college years.<br />\nA broad handle of good sound wood is the<br />\nright backing of a chisel's cutting edge. A narrow handle back of a narrow edge makes a poor<br />\ncombination. When Paul wrote to Timothy,<br />\nwho was hardly out of his preparatory work,<br />\nIle said : \"Take heed to thyself and to the<br />\ndoctrine,\" putting what he was, ahead of what<br />\nhe knew.<br />\n<br />\nNo. 5<br />\n<br />\nTake heed to your body is a word for today.<br />\nA young man hardly knows what a tremendous<br />\npart of himself his body is and of what importance it will be in the work of later life.<br />\nAbuse it, overtax it, sin against it, underfeed,<br />\nunder-exercise, or under-rest it, and you will<br />\nfind that nature is a minute bookkeeper, charging every item of overdrawn money, and doing<br />\nheartless and heart-breaking work when she<br />\nforecloses. The danger of specialization has<br />\ncrept into athletics. Few boilers can run more<br />\nthan one large engine. Few stomachs and<br />\nnervous systems can support good scholars and<br />\nprize athletes. This is too often discovered<br />\nafter graduation. The prizes are as dangerous<br />\non the campus as in the study hall. The exercise that keeps hunger healthy, the skin active,<br />\nthat breaks down and cleans out old tissue and<br />\ngives an honest physical need of sleep is enough<br />\nfor the average college man. As much exercise as this a good scholar must have. If he<br />\nmisses some scholastic prizes in keeping his<br />\nbody in order he has made a good bargain.<br />\nSo few men can be prize winners and yet keep<br />\nhealthy bodies that I advise boys I know going<br />\nto college to keep shoulder high with the best<br />\nin their class rather than make the sacrifice<br />\nthat is demanded to top its head by half an inch.<br />\nOf course, a man should be ashamed of himself<br />\nwho lets men suspect. that he intends to be a<br />\nchiropodist by being always at the foot of his<br />\nclass. To be in the nineties is hard enough<br />\nwork and a high enough aim for a man who<br />\ndoes not plan to be a burnt offering at one<br />\nhundred on Ambition's altar. The point is not<br />\nto outpoint some competitor, but to be equipped<br />\nfor your life work and fairly equal to it in body<br />\nand mind. An honest student with a healthy<br />\nbody will whip the intellectual freak in the<br />\nlong run.<br />\nFew students need to be cautioned against<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nstanding too high in their classes, but many in dom\u2014the reign of the King inside and outside<br />\nthe Hopkins, and especially among the post- of you.

They need to \"see the King in his<br />\nrough flints once, but rubbing together took beauty in the land of the far distance,\" to feel<br />\noff their corners. There is a disciplining of the magnificence of the Kingdom, the reign of<br />\nassociation which is essential to a full orbed God in all human thought and action. The<br />\nman.

Keep in touch with the King- , Professor Charles A. Smith, of the Univer-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nsity of Louisiana, when he was in Baltimore not<br />\nlong ago, drew attention to the new direction<br />\ntaken by the literature of the South in its development since the war. Instead of seeking<br />\nsubjects and material from foreign lands and<br />\ncustoms, the more recent Southern authors<br />\nhave dealt with the life immediately around<br />\nthem, illustrating Southern character, dialect<br />\nand habits. Thus, as Professor Smith points<br />\nout, the literature produced in the South since<br />\nthe war possesses a positive historical value,<br />\nand a collection of these recent works cannot<br />\nfail to be of the highest interest.<br />\nSuch have been the reasons which influenced<br />\nDr. Adams in making his collection. It consists entirely of novels and other purely literary<br />\nworks, and when it is finally catalogued and<br />\nplaced in the library, it will prove an important<br />\naid to those who desire to learn more of the<br />\nhistory and development of a part of the country which possesses a remarkably large and inexhaustible store of literary material in its<br />\npeculiar traditions and customs.<br />\n<br />\nPRESIDENT OILMAN'S NEW BOOK.<br />\n<br />\nThe Century Company has recently published a new work by President Gilman, entitled, University Problems in the United<br />\nStates.\" It consists of several addresses, most<br />\nof which were delivered at other institutions,<br />\nincluding Harvard, Yale, Cornell and California. Perhaps the most interesting address,<br />\nto Hopkins men at least, is his inaugural, delivered at the opening of the University in<br />\n1876. He speaks of the buildings in the heart<br />\nof the city as merely temporary, until the completion of arrangements for the final establishment at Clifton. The book also contains a letter written by Dr. Gilman in response to a request for his views on the advisability of founding a national university at Washington. In<br />\nthis he shows how greatly such an institution<br />\nwould interfere with all the existing colleges<br />\nand universities of the East, and especially<br />\nwith those in and about Washington. The plan<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nwhich he suggests is a union of the many noteworthy educational institutions of Washington<br />\nabout the Smithsonian as a centre. In this<br />\nway a university would be established which<br />\nwould afford the highest facilities to those<br />\nstudents who desire to do earnest and, in some<br />\ndegree, independent work, as such an institution would have\"no curriculum, no public examinations, no degrees, but abundant opportunities.\"<br />\n<br />\nnR. 110TT<br />\n<br />\nAT THE V. 11. C. A.<br />\n<br />\nOn Tuesday, November 29, the anniversary<br />\nof the organization of the University Y. M. C.<br />\nA., a large number of students assembled in<br />\nthe chapel to hear Mr. John R. Mott. Mr.<br />\nMott, who is general secretary of the World's<br />\nStudent Christian Federation, told of the work<br />\nof that remarkable organization, and sketched<br />\nthe course of his recent journey from college<br />\nto college around the world. At eight o'clock<br />\non the same evening the officers and committees of the Association met, on the invitation<br />\nof Mr. Eugene Levering, at his home on Eutaw Place, for a committee conference and<br />\na reception in Mr. Mott's honor. Short addresses, committee reports and questions, followed by refreshments, made up a delightful<br />\nevening.<br />\nA remark of Mr. Mott's\u2014especially interesting in view of the fact that no one is better<br />\nacquainted with the colleges of the world\u2014was<br />\nthe following : \"There is no other university<br />\nin this country so much looked up to by foreign universities as Johns Hopkins.\"<br />\nMr. Mott called attention to the fact in order<br />\nto point out our greater responsibility.

U.; or box 398, Medical School<br />\nof Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n<br />\nSOME, to whose words both experience and<br />\nobservation should lend authority, have said<br />\nthat most college men may expect to get as<br />\nmuch from association with their class-mates<br />\nand instructors as from actual study. If this be<br />\ntrue, those agencies that tend to bring college<br />\nmen together are valuable and worthy of more<br />\nconsideration than we sometimes give them.<br />\nMany such agencies exist here, and all have<br />\ntheir peculiar advantages and limitations. The<br />\nfraternities, with their intimate and enduring<br />\nfellowships are at the same time restricted to<br />\na few, and naturally clannish. Although they<br />\nare often very helpful to the individuals who<br />\nbelong to them, their influence upon college life<br />\nas a whole is of doubtful value. Other associations attract only those who pursue certain<br />\nstudies.<br />\nA welcome to the sessions of the<br />\nPhilological Association has little charm for<br />\none who does not care for Greek roots. If you<br />\ndo not know bugs and plants you must shun<br />\nthe Naturalists' Club. If you can't tell a knight<br />\nfrom a rook or know the mystery of a king's<br />\ngambit, the Chess Club will bore you. Even<br />\nthe Y. M. C. A., with its broad principles, is<br />\navoided by some who fear that the secretary<br />\nmay try to convert them.<br />\nOf late a new institution has been discov-<br />\n<br />\nered which has the same end as the organizations just mentioned, and lacks many of their<br />\ndisadvantages. Its chief fault is its very transient character, which, unfortunately, cannot<br />\nbe remedied. This promoter of good-fellowship is known by the somewhat inelegant title,<br />\nFeed.\" Our first experience with it was at<br />\nthe opening of the cage last winter, and we<br />\nwere all much gratified by the result.<br />\nThat informal celebration, which it is hardly<br />\nnecessary to describe here, now seems all the<br />\nmore satisfactory when it is compared with a<br />\nsomewhat elaborate feast held at the end of the<br />\nyear in a near-by restaurant. This was planned<br />\nin honor of our athletic victories and as a farewell to the seniors. The design was good, but<br />\nthe way in which it was carried out was much<br />\nto our discredit. For the sake of the reputation of the University and the self-respect of<br />\nthe students, it is to be hoped that they will<br />\nnever celebrate their victories in such fashion<br />\nagain.<br />\nLet us make the \"Athletic Feed\" under our<br />\nown roof-tree a permanent thing, and future<br />\ngenerations will hold us in grateful recollection.<br />\n<br />\nONE of the few traditions in force at Hopkins is in regard to class colors. For a number<br />\nof years it has been the invariable rule for each<br />\nentering class to adopt the colors of the class<br />\nwhich graduated the same year. When the<br />\npreliminary year was instituted we had four<br />\nclasses, and '99, the first class to follow the<br />\nchange, was obliged to adopt new colors. Attention has been called to the matter by the<br />\nfact that 1901, without much thought of the<br />\ntradition, many of the men being ignorant of<br />\nit, happily hit upon the right colors. The<br />\nseniors were at fault here.

Unmolested, they appear<br />\nto think they are unrivaled. It is just such a<br />\nmistake as a freshman would be expected to<br />\nmake, and comes from ignorance of that unwritten lore of the student body. It is peculiarly befitting at Hopkins, with the sophomore year eliminated, that freshmen be shown<br />\nevery consideration in college affairs, and that<br />\ncompetent men be given a fair chance for clubs<br />\nand teams. \u2022 And yet it would be quite becoming for the over-enthusiastic member of that<br />\nclass to restrain somewhat his feelings of enlarged importance upon matriculation, to heed<br />\nthe scriptural injunction and \"show by his<br />\ngood life his works in meekness of wisdom.\"<br />\nBOOK NOTES.<br />\n<br />\nTwo new books have recently been issued in<br />\nthe series of Harper's Scientific Memoirs,<br />\nwhich is edited under the supervision of Dr.<br />\nJ.

With the ball on Rugby's oneyard line, somebody called time, and the Rugbys stopped playing, although the official timekeeper insisted that two minutes yet remained<br />\nfor play. In the dispute that ensued, the park<br />\npolice, who had at no time kept the field clear,<br />\nnow officiously stepped in and refused to allow<br />\nthe game to go on.<br />\nThe crowd was very much in the way, and<br />\nthis fact was largely responsible for Rugby's<br />\ntouchdown. Fumbling lost Hopkins the ball<br />\nat one time, when within a few yards of their<br />\nopponents' goal.<br />\nRugby kicked off, and Preston caught the<br />\nball. In about one minute of play, Haskell<br />\nbroke through the line and ran sixty yards for<br />\na touchdown. Griffin kicked goal. After the<br />\nnext kick-off the Hopkins Imcks plunged<br />\nthrough the line and around the ends for considerable gains. The ball was gotten by Rugby, and Mealy made a thirty-yard run. Hopkins again recovered the ball, and Griffin punted to Rugby's twenty-five-yard line. Clark<br />\ndowned the man as soon as the ball was caught.<br />\nRugby then carried the game up the field, and<br />\npunted over Hopkins' goal, making a touchback. The half ended with the ball in Rugby's<br />\nterritory.<br />\nIn the second half Mealy got around right<br />\nend for a seventy-five-yard run and a touchdown: Heise kicked goal.

D.<br /><br />\nThe demands of scholarship were never<br />\nharder and higher than they are today. The<br />\nera of specialties is upon us. A man to count<br />\nmust be an authority in his department, and<br />\nthis invcdves an element of competition, as well<br />\nas concentration, unparalleled in other days.<br />\nBecause of this specializing, men are apt to<br />\nunderestimate the value of straight college<br />\ntraining uninfluenced by a professional outlook. 1 believe that college is for the whole<br />\nman rather than the specialized scholar, for the<br />\ndisciplining of his mind, for the concentration<br />\nof attention, with moral as well as mental results, for the culture which puts one in touch<br />\nwith the world's thoughts and achievements,<br />\nthat multiplies his sympathies and widens his<br />\nhorizon, that teaches a man where to find the<br />\nproper tools of intellectual life and how to use<br />\nthem.<br />\nAs far as possible the peril of specializing in<br />\nthe college course should be avoided. To know<br />\nmuch of any one thing involves intentional<br />\nignorance of a great many others. The intentional ignorance should not be too great. Here<br />\nis the function of the college in giving a foundation for a specialty. If the Washington<br />\nmonument had a foundation no wider than it,<br />\nown base, it would be a perilous affair. if<br />\nyou know your calling in advance, do not imperil it by a too sympathetic choice of electives<br />\nin the college years.<br />\nA broad handle of good sound wood is the<br />\nright backing of a chisel's cutting edge. A narrow handle back of a narrow edge makes a poor<br />\ncombination. When Paul wrote to Timothy,<br />\nwho was hardly out of his preparatory work,<br />\nIle said : \"Take heed to thyself and to the<br />\ndoctrine,\" putting what he was, ahead of what<br />\nhe knew.<br /><br />\nNo. 5<br /><br />\nTake heed to your body is a word for today.<br />\nA young man hardly knows what a tremendous<br />\npart of himself his body is and of what importance it will be in the work of later life.<br />\nAbuse it, overtax it, sin against it, underfeed,<br />\nunder-exercise, or under-rest it, and you will<br />\nfind that nature is a minute bookkeeper, charging every item of overdrawn money, and doing<br />\nheartless and heart-breaking work when she<br />\nforecloses. The danger of specialization has<br />\ncrept into athletics. Few boilers can run more<br />\nthan one large engine. Few stomachs and<br />\nnervous systems can support good scholars and<br />\nprize athletes. This is too often discovered<br />\nafter graduation. The prizes are as dangerous<br />\non the campus as in the study hall. The exercise that keeps hunger healthy, the skin active,<br />\nthat breaks down and cleans out old tissue and<br />\ngives an honest physical need of sleep is enough<br />\nfor the average college man. As much exercise as this a good scholar must have. If he<br />\nmisses some scholastic prizes in keeping his<br />\nbody in order he has made a good bargain.<br />\nSo few men can be prize winners and yet keep<br />\nhealthy bodies that I advise boys I know going<br />\nto college to keep shoulder high with the best<br />\nin their class rather than make the sacrifice<br />\nthat is demanded to top its head by half an inch.<br />\nOf course, a man should be ashamed of himself<br />\nwho lets men suspect. that he intends to be a<br />\nchiropodist by being always at the foot of his<br />\nclass. To be in the nineties is hard enough<br />\nwork and a high enough aim for a man who<br />\ndoes not plan to be a burnt offering at one<br />\nhundred on Ambition's altar. The point is not<br />\nto outpoint some competitor, but to be equipped<br />\nfor your life work and fairly equal to it in body<br />\nand mind. An honest student with a healthy<br />\nbody will whip the intellectual freak in the<br />\nlong run.<br />\nFew students need to be cautioned against<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nstanding too high in their classes, but many in dom\u2014the reign of the King inside and outside<br />\nthe Hopkins, and especially among the post- of you.

Smith, of the Univer-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nsity of Louisiana, when he was in Baltimore not<br />\nlong ago, drew attention to the new direction<br />\ntaken by the literature of the South in its development since the war. Instead of seeking<br />\nsubjects and material from foreign lands and<br />\ncustoms, the more recent Southern authors<br />\nhave dealt with the life immediately around<br />\nthem, illustrating Southern character, dialect<br />\nand habits. Thus, as Professor Smith points<br />\nout, the literature produced in the South since<br />\nthe war possesses a positive historical value,<br />\nand a collection of these recent works cannot<br />\nfail to be of the highest interest.<br />\nSuch have been the reasons which influenced<br />\nDr. Adams in making his collection. It consists entirely of novels and other purely literary<br />\nworks, and when it is finally catalogued and<br />\nplaced in the library, it will prove an important<br />\naid to those who desire to learn more of the<br />\nhistory and development of a part of the country which possesses a remarkably large and inexhaustible store of literary material in its<br />\npeculiar traditions and customs.<br /><br />\nPRESIDENT OILMAN'S NEW BOOK.<br /><br />\nThe Century Company has recently published a new work by President Gilman, entitled, University Problems in the United<br />\nStates.\" It consists of several addresses, most<br />\nof which were delivered at other institutions,<br />\nincluding Harvard, Yale, Cornell and California. Perhaps the most interesting address,<br />\nto Hopkins men at least, is his inaugural, delivered at the opening of the University in<br />\n1876. He speaks of the buildings in the heart<br />\nof the city as merely temporary, until the completion of arrangements for the final establishment at Clifton. The book also contains a letter written by Dr. Gilman in response to a request for his views on the advisability of founding a national university at Washington. In<br />\nthis he shows how greatly such an institution<br />\nwould interfere with all the existing colleges<br />\nand universities of the East, and especially<br />\nwith those in and about Washington. The plan<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nwhich he suggests is a union of the many noteworthy educational institutions of Washington<br />\nabout the Smithsonian as a centre. In this<br />\nway a university would be established which<br />\nwould afford the highest facilities to those<br />\nstudents who desire to do earnest and, in some<br />\ndegree, independent work, as such an institution would have\"no curriculum, no public examinations, no degrees, but abundant opportunities.\"<br /><br />\nnR. 110TT<br /><br />\nAT THE V. 11. C. A.<br /><br />\nOn Tuesday, November 29, the anniversary<br />\nof the organization of the University Y. M. C.<br />\nA., a large number of students assembled in<br />\nthe chapel to hear Mr. John R. Mott. Mr.<br />\nMott, who is general secretary of the World's<br />\nStudent Christian Federation, told of the work<br />\nof that remarkable organization, and sketched<br />\nthe course of his recent journey from college<br />\nto college around the world. At eight o'clock<br />\non the same evening the officers and committees of the Association met, on the invitation<br />\nof Mr. Eugene Levering, at his home on Eutaw Place, for a committee conference and<br />\na reception in Mr. Mott's honor. Short addresses, committee reports and questions, followed by refreshments, made up a delightful<br />\nevening.<br />\nA remark of Mr. Mott's\u2014especially interesting in view of the fact that no one is better<br />\nacquainted with the colleges of the world\u2014was<br />\nthe following : \"There is no other university<br />\nin this country so much looked up to by foreign universities as Johns Hopkins.\"<br />\nMr. Mott called attention to the fact in order<br />\nto point out our greater responsibility.

If this be<br />\ntrue, those agencies that tend to bring college<br />\nmen together are valuable and worthy of more<br />\nconsideration than we sometimes give them.<br />\nMany such agencies exist here, and all have<br />\ntheir peculiar advantages and limitations. The<br />\nfraternities, with their intimate and enduring<br />\nfellowships are at the same time restricted to<br />\na few, and naturally clannish. Although they<br />\nare often very helpful to the individuals who<br />\nbelong to them, their influence upon college life<br />\nas a whole is of doubtful value. Other associations attract only those who pursue certain<br />\nstudies.<br />\nA welcome to the sessions of the<br />\nPhilological Association has little charm for<br />\none who does not care for Greek roots. If you<br />\ndo not know bugs and plants you must shun<br />\nthe Naturalists' Club. If you can't tell a knight<br />\nfrom a rook or know the mystery of a king's<br />\ngambit, the Chess Club will bore you. Even<br />\nthe Y. M. C. A., with its broad principles, is<br />\navoided by some who fear that the secretary<br />\nmay try to convert them.<br />\nOf late a new institution has been discov-<br /><br />\nered which has the same end as the organizations just mentioned, and lacks many of their<br />\ndisadvantages. Its chief fault is its very transient character, which, unfortunately, cannot<br />\nbe remedied. This promoter of good-fellowship is known by the somewhat inelegant title,<br />\nFeed.\" Our first experience with it was at<br />\nthe opening of the cage last winter, and we<br />\nwere all much gratified by the result.<br />\nThat informal celebration, which it is hardly<br />\nnecessary to describe here, now seems all the<br />\nmore satisfactory when it is compared with a<br />\nsomewhat elaborate feast held at the end of the<br />\nyear in a near-by restaurant. This was planned<br />\nin honor of our athletic victories and as a farewell to the seniors. The design was good, but<br />\nthe way in which it was carried out was much<br />\nto our discredit. For the sake of the reputation of the University and the self-respect of<br />\nthe students, it is to be hoped that they will<br />\nnever celebrate their victories in such fashion<br />\nagain.<br />\nLet us make the \"Athletic Feed\" under our<br />\nown roof-tree a permanent thing, and future<br />\ngenerations will hold us in grateful recollection.<br /><br />\nONE of the few traditions in force at Hopkins is in regard to class colors. For a number<br />\nof years it has been the invariable rule for each<br />\nentering class to adopt the colors of the class<br />\nwhich graduated the same year. When the<br />\npreliminary year was instituted we had four<br />\nclasses, and '99, the first class to follow the<br />\nchange, was obliged to adopt new colors. Attention has been called to the matter by the<br />\nfact that 1901, without much thought of the<br />\ntradition, many of the men being ignorant of<br />\nit, happily hit upon the right colors. The<br />\nseniors were at fault here. They should see<br />\nthat men who have not been at the University<br />\nlong enough to learn the customs in such matters, do not go on with organization in ignorance of them. There is no reason why the tradition, which is now firmly fixed, should not<br />\nbe observed by each new class.

Unmolested, they appear<br />\nto think they are unrivaled. It is just such a<br />\nmistake as a freshman would be expected to<br />\nmake, and comes from ignorance of that unwritten lore of the student body. It is peculiarly befitting at Hopkins, with the sophomore year eliminated, that freshmen be shown<br />\nevery consideration in college affairs, and that<br />\ncompetent men be given a fair chance for clubs<br />\nand teams. \u2022 And yet it would be quite becoming for the over-enthusiastic member of that<br />\nclass to restrain somewhat his feelings of enlarged importance upon matriculation, to heed<br />\nthe scriptural injunction and \"show by his<br />\ngood life his works in meekness of wisdom.\"<br />\nBOOK NOTES.<br /><br />\nTwo new books have recently been issued in<br />\nthe series of Harper's Scientific Memoirs,<br />\nwhich is edited under the supervision of Dr.<br />\nJ.

The hands are clasped in an attitude of devotion, and very large tears are running down his cheeks.\" This cartoon the Professor presented to a native. \"A few days<br />\nlater,\" he says,\"I was surprised to see it hanging at one end of the man's hut, in a neat bamboo frame. Even then I failed to appreciate<br />\nthe full meaning of the situation until six<br />\no'clock, when father, mother, and children fell<br />\non their knees before the preposterous thing,<br />\nand offered to it their evening petitions !\"<br /><br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\nFOOT BALL.<br /><br />\nTHE: SCRUBS 6\u2014Rucitv 6.<br />\nThe members of the scrub football team were<br />\nperhaps not quite as thankful as they should<br />\nhave been on Thanksgiving Day, for the unsatisfactory outcome of their game of the day<br />\nbefore with the Rugby eleven was enough to<br />\ndisturb the complacency of the most even-tempered.<br />\nHopkins should have won, and would have<br />\ndone so easily had the game continued a few<br />\nminutes longer. With the ball on Rugby's oneyard line, somebody called time, and the Rugbys stopped playing, although the official timekeeper insisted that two minutes yet remained<br />\nfor play. In the dispute that ensued, the park<br />\npolice, who had at no time kept the field clear,<br />\nnow officiously stepped in and refused to allow<br />\nthe game to go on.<br />\nThe crowd was very much in the way, and<br />\nthis fact was largely responsible for Rugby's<br />\ntouchdown. Fumbling lost Hopkins the ball<br />\nat one time, when within a few yards of their<br />\nopponents' goal.<br />\nRugby kicked off, and Preston caught the<br />\nball. In about one minute of play, Haskell<br />\nbroke through the line and ran sixty yards for<br />\na touchdown. Griffin kicked goal. After the<br />\nnext kick-off the Hopkins Imcks plunged<br />\nthrough the line and around the ends for considerable gains. The ball was gotten by Rugby, and Mealy made a thirty-yard run. Hopkins again recovered the ball, and Griffin punted to Rugby's twenty-five-yard line. Clark<br />\ndowned the man as soon as the ball was caught.<br />\nRugby then carried the game up the field, and<br />\npunted over Hopkins' goal, making a touchback. The half ended with the ball in Rugby's<br />\nterritory.<br />\nIn the second half Mealy got around right<br />\nend for a seventy-five-yard run and a touchdown: Heise kicked goal. Hopkins braced up<br />\nand in a few minutes had the ball dangerously<br />\nnear Rugby's goal.

Although it seems rank heresy,<br />\nfrom an upper-classman's standpoint, to attribute to the freshmen any good qualities, except<br />\nthose of perfect respect and obedience, yet, in<br />\nthe line of athletics, at least, events speak for<br />\nthemselves, and the class of 19or has already<br />\nmade a commendable record.<br />\nThe first 1901 man to win distinction was<br />\nFishach, who cleared 9 feet 6 inches in the<br />\npole vault at the C.
