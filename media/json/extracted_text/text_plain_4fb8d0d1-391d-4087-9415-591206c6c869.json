This<br />\nwas the worst beating a Hopkins<br />\nteam has suffered in many years.<br />\nNavy was strong, fast, and, in<br />\ntip-top condition, and always had<br />\nthe jump on the Varsity. The<br />\nHopkins attack was weakened by<br />\nthe- absence of Winslow and Beall<br />\nand by the injury to Stuart, which<br />\nkept him out of half of the game.<br />\nThe defense helped out as much<br />\nas they could, but were unable to<br />\nget away from the midshipmen,<br />\nwho were very fast and had<br />\nenough stamina to set the pace<br />\nthrough the entire game. The<br />\nHopkins points, Morley and Meyer, put up a splendid game, breaking down the Navy attack time<br />\nand again; they started the ball<br />\nout to the midfield, but it seldom<br />\ngot within scoring distance.<br />\n\"Sam\" Silberstein, \"Joe\" Bremen<br />\nand \"Dodo' Frisch played good<br />\nscrappy games, body checking the<br />\nmidshipmen and following the<br />\nball closely throughout the game.<br />\nTwo of the Navy men were carried off the field as result of the<br />\nhard playing; but it was not all<br />\non one side by any means. Hopkins men also spent some time on<br />\nthe ground.<br />\nThe first score came within a<br />\nminute of the opening of the<br />\ngame, when Voinot, Navy third<br />\nattack, ran around the entireHopkins defense and tossed the ball to<br />\nWisenbaker, who netted an easy<br />\ngoal, uncovered, from the crease.<br />\nMost of Navy's goals were shot in<br />\nthat way; the men would run<br />\naround the Hopkins men, get inside and shoot clean. During the<br />\nfirst half seven goals in all were<br />\nshot; Warner, Gearing and Shaw<br />\ngetting the others between them.<br />\nAt the beginning of the second<br />\nhalf Hopkins tightened, but Shaw<br />\nand Wisenbaker finally managed<br />\nto get the ball and shoot. During<br />\nthe last few minutes, Warner,<br />\nNavy's first attack, ran wild, scoring three goals in rapid succession. During the second half<br />\nNavy kept sending in fresh men,<br />\nand were continually able to keep<br />\nU p the fast pace, though the Hopkins team strengthened considerably, sending Stanley in at cover<br />\nand bringing Meyer out to third,<br />\nwhere he could come through<br />\nmore easily.

C.)<br />\n<br />\nWashington today is the center<br />\nof all our war work. It is here<br />\nthat all the plans are made. It<br />\nis here that all the orders are issued and all reports are sent. in<br />\nall the work made necessary by<br />\nthis greatest task our country has<br />\never undertaken, there is much<br />\nconfusion and inefficiency caused<br />\nby so many people trying to fill<br />\npositions for which they have had<br />\nno training. Here we find men<br />\nwho have given up positions paying salaries all the way up to<br />\n$50,000 a year and accepting positions to work for the Government in this war for anywhere<br />\nfrom $1 a year to $200 or $300 a<br />\nmonth. These men are working<br />\nfrom 12 to 20 hours a day\u2014living on such food as they can get\u2014<br />\nwhich is sometimes poor\u2014sleeping in crowded quarters, sacrificing all home ties and family life,<br />\nto help win the war.<br />\nWe find girls working diligently at all kinds of office work\u2014<br />\neating in restaurants\u2014sleeping 8<br />\nand 10 in a room\u2014sacrificing social life, deprived of home comforts\u2014all doing their best to win<br />\nthe war.<br />\nEvery office building is overcrowded; the Government having<br />\ntaken most of the desirable buildings for its own use. It is almost<br />\nimpossible to secure a \u2022room in a<br />\nhotel. Boarding houses are all<br />\ncrowded, and nowhere except in<br />\nthe very high priced places is a<br />\nroom rented to less than two people. Traffic conditions are seriously overtaxed. It is a rare<br />\nthing to see a gentleman seated in<br />\na trolley car. To leave the city<br />\nby train, in either sleeper archair<br />\ncar, reservation must be secured<br />\nlong in advance.<br />\nOne cannot but be impressed by<br />\nthe seriousness expressed in the<br />\nfaces on the street. The determination, the earnestness, the enthusiasm is infectious; everyone<br />\ncatches the spirit that dominates<br />\nthe thought of every mind to win<br />\nthe war. It is not possible to be<br />\nin the midst of all this rush and<br />\nhustle without the wish to be part<br />\nof it. It forces itself into the<br />\nmind and into the heart of every<br />\nman.<br />\nThis is the spirit that has come<br />\nto those who have learned the<br />\nsecret, those who are willing to<br />\ndo of their own free will, the<br />\nthing that Germany has been<br />\ncompelled and forced to do by an<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 7, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on pay,-e 7, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nDouglas H.

As it is, we accept the defeat, unashamed, with equanimity, an(l, perhaps, not without a degree of<br />\npride. We gladly yield to Navy all the credit for the decisive victory<br />\nshe won; but we must admit that we failed to feel the sting of an overwhelming defeat.<br />\nHopkins lacrosse teams are not accustomed to defeat; nor are we<br />\naccustomed to explaining away lost lacrosse games. Lacrosse is to<br />\nHopkins what football is to Harvard and Yale. In other words, we<br />\ntake it as a matter of course that Hopkins shall have a championship<br />\n(or at least a \"runner-up\") lacrosse team. Last Saturday the Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team suffered the most overwhelming defeat in ,the history of<br />\nHopkins lacrosse.<br />\nHopkins lacrosse need never have suffered the terrific dssault that<br />\nwas made on its pride last Saturday. It might have adopted an \"informal\" lacrosse team this year, after the fashion of certain estimable<br />\nand large colleges. There was reason enough; there was not a single<br />\nregular left; military training conflicted with practices; almost every<br />\nmember of the squad had to learn the ,game for the first time; the<br />\ncoaches were unable to give the necessary time to the team. But Captain Schmidt's inexperienced men went down to Annapolis and faced<br />\nwhat is always one of the strongest teams in the country\u2014a team<br />\nthat was not handicapped in the least by the war.

During the second half<br />\nNavy kept sending in fresh men,<br />\nand were continually able to keep<br />\nU p the fast pace, though the Hopkins team strengthened considerably, sending Stanley in at cover<br />\nand bringing Meyer out to third,<br />\nwhere he could come through<br />\nmore easily.

It<br />\nis here that all the orders are issued and all reports are sent. in<br />\nall the work made necessary by<br />\nthis greatest task our country has<br />\never undertaken, there is much<br />\nconfusion and inefficiency caused<br />\nby so many people trying to fill<br />\npositions for which they have had<br />\nno training. Here we find men<br />\nwho have given up positions paying salaries all the way up to<br />\n$50,000 a year and accepting positions to work for the Government in this war for anywhere<br />\nfrom $1 a year to $200 or $300 a<br />\nmonth. These men are working<br />\nfrom 12 to 20 hours a day\u2014living on such food as they can get\u2014<br />\nwhich is sometimes poor\u2014sleeping in crowded quarters, sacrificing all home ties and family life,<br />\nto help win the war.<br />\nWe find girls working diligently at all kinds of office work\u2014<br />\neating in restaurants\u2014sleeping 8<br />\nand 10 in a room\u2014sacrificing social life, deprived of home comforts\u2014all doing their best to win<br />\nthe war.<br />\nEvery office building is overcrowded; the Government having<br />\ntaken most of the desirable buildings for its own use.

The determination, the earnestness, the enthusiasm is infectious; everyone<br />\ncatches the spirit that dominates<br />\nthe thought of every mind to win<br />\nthe war. It is not possible to be<br />\nin the midst of all this rush and<br />\nhustle without the wish to be part<br />\nof it.

As it is, we accept the defeat, unashamed, with equanimity, an(l, perhaps, not without a degree of<br />\npride. We gladly yield to Navy all the credit for the decisive victory<br />\nshe won; but we must admit that we failed to feel the sting of an overwhelming defeat.<br />\nHopkins lacrosse teams are not accustomed to defeat; nor are we<br />\naccustomed to explaining away lost lacrosse games. Lacrosse is to<br />\nHopkins what football is to Harvard and Yale. In other words, we<br />\ntake it as a matter of course that Hopkins shall have a championship<br />\n(or at least a \"runner-up\") lacrosse team. Last Saturday the Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team suffered the most overwhelming defeat in ,the history of<br />\nHopkins lacrosse.<br />\nHopkins lacrosse need never have suffered the terrific dssault that<br />\nwas made on its pride last Saturday. It might have adopted an \"informal\" lacrosse team this year, after the fashion of certain estimable<br />\nand large colleges. There was reason enough; there was not a single<br />\nregular left; military training conflicted with practices; almost every<br />\nmember of the squad had to learn the ,game for the first time; the<br />\ncoaches were unable to give the necessary time to the team. But Captain Schmidt's inexperienced men went down to Annapolis and faced<br />\nwhat is always one of the strongest teams in the country\u2014a team<br />\nthat was not handicapped in the least by the war.
