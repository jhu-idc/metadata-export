However,<br />\nmore than eighty of your fellow students during the past<br />\ntwo years did not keep walking, or if they did, at least<br />\ncontinued to turn the idea over in their minds during the<br />\nensuing chem lecture.<br />\nThese are the students v,;:io have taken or are<br />\ncurrently on a leave of absence from the university. Their<br />\nactivities range from such \"non-intellectual\" pursuits as<br />\ngrape-picking and selling beer at Memorial Stadium to<br />\ncommunity organizing in a low-income<br />\nneighborhood<br />\nand social relations study at an overseas institution. They<br />\nrepresent a variety of different majors, interests, and<br />\ntemperaments, but all agree that their time off was time<br />\nwell spent. And most report that their leaves of absence<br />\ndramatically affected<br />\ntheir perspectives on Johns<br />\nHopkins University and on education in general.<br />\n<br />\nalso true that Johns Hopkins has a good name, and that as<br />\na student here you are considered high quality material,\"<br />\nshe says. \"If you'rc willing to work to get a job, write the<br />\nletters and sell yourself, then you can get it.\"<br />\nBaughn believes that holding a job in an area of<br />\ninterest can be a very exciting thing to do with a year off.<br />\n\"Waitressing or bartending can be fun to do for<br />\nawhile, because it's something different,\" she says. \"But<br />\nan eight-to-five job, with an hour for lunch, using the<br />\nskills you've learned - that's really an experience.\"<br />\nStill others chose to study abroad. Joy Straus also<br />\nspent five months at a school in Israel.<br />\n\"I wanted to study religion, and not get the usual<br />\nwatered-down version,\" -she says. \"I figured Israel would<br />\nbe the right place to do it.\"<br />\nStraus said the intellectual level of her classmates<br />\nthere made her appreciate Hopkins' students more.<br />\n\"They'd begin all these good discussions, and then<br />\nnot be able to take them anywhere,\" slie says. \"I was one<br />\nof the smartest people there, which was nice for my ego,<br />\nbut a burden otherwise.\"<br />\n<br />\nabroad.\" However, Dr. Ghislaine Goddenne, director of<br />\ncounseling and psychiatric services at Hopkins, says<br />\nshe believes that the motivation for taking a leave of<br />\nabsence is often deep-seated and extremely important.<br />\n\"The student taking time off is often someone<br />\nwho has not yet formed an identity,\" she says. \"He is<br />\nseeking a moratorium,.to borrow a term from Erickson - a<br />\ntime when they can stand still and find out who they are.<br />\nThis is not something which is achieved easily or peacefully, but it is something which the student must do.\"<br />\nThe search for identity seems to begin before the<br />\nperson is consciously aware of it, and to affect the motivation and performance of even the most enthusiastic<br />\nstudent.<br />\n\"I'm a self-starter, a task-driver, and I actually<br />\nused to like to study,\" says Jeff Levy, who entered<br />\nHopkins at the age of sixteen, in an accelerated mathematics program. \"But it suddenly isn't fun anymore.<br />\nI'm just accelerating, without a goal, with my eyes straight<br />\non the road ahead and no chance to look around.

Every time I<br />\nthought I was going to come home,something new would<br />\ncome along - like Egypt, or Italy. I'd still be going yet<br />\nif it wasn't so difficult getting from place to place.\"<br />\nHelen Hall-Craggs, a languages major who actually<br />\ndid pick grapes in southern France, also<br />\nlived with a<br />\nfamily there.<br />\n\"It was great to see the country that way,\" she<br />\nsays. \"I think they were much more accepting of me than<br />\nIf I had been a tourist.\"<br />\nAnd Chip Carlson, a junior majoring in political<br />\neconomy, held a variety of jobs during his year off which<br />\nenabled him to travel to California, the Florida Keys, and<br />\nNew Orleans.<br />\n\"I waited on tables, I sold beer at the Orioles<br />\ngames,\" he says. \"I'm still doing that, It's a good job to<br />\nhave while school's on, because they play away half the<br />\ntime and you can get your work done.\"<br />\nOthers pursued jobs which related directly to their<br />\nacademic interests. Patricia Madden, a senior majoring in<br />\nsocial relations, worked as a community organizer with a<br />\nVISTA-funded citizens' organization in South Bethlehem,<br />\nPennsylvania.<br />\n\"We were basically trying to give the people of<br />\nSouth Bethlehem a voice on issues such as housing, crime,<br />\nhealth, and use of development funds,\" she says. \"The<br />\nidea was not to tell the people what to do, but to find out<br />\nwhat they wanted to do, and help them do it. I would<br />\ngo around from door to door, asking people who'd never<br />\nseen me before how they felt about the glass, the rowdies,<br />\nand the drugs over in the neighborhood park. Once they<br />\ngot rolling, they couldn't get mad enough, and you'd end<br />\nup talking to them for an hour.\"<br />\nMadden says she received three days of training for<br />\nthe job, which she got through a friend in the VISTA<br />\nprogram. There were no academic or experience requirements for the job. VISTA payed her a salary of<br />\n$135 every two weeks, plus a stipend of $75 a month.<br />\n\"They want you to live on. a level close to that of<br />\nthe people you're working with,\" she says. \u2022<br />\nJeff Levy, a junior seeking a degree in math and<br />\nphysics, is currently on leave, applying for jobs with<br />\nairplane and computer manufacturing companies. \"It'll<br />\nbe enough of a change of pace from school and I may be able to<br />\nfind work with a company that I can come back to when I'm<br />\nout of school,\" he says.<br />\nLevy has unique qualifications for jobs in his field.<br />\nHe has already completed the undergraduate requirements<br />\nfor a degree in math despite the fact that he still hasn't<br />\ngraduated. However, Hopkins job placement director<br />\nSharon BaUghn says that good jobs are within reach of<br />\nany student on a year off.<br />\n\"It can be tough, because employers are often<br />\nreluctant to invest time in training you when they know<br />\nthey're going to lose you after a year,\" she says. \"But it's<br />\n<br />\nII1<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nNM EMI M MIN MII=INN NM INN NM EN M in<br />\n<br />\n\"I could have gone to pieces, but that didn't seem<br />\nlike a very good idea,\" he says. \"I could have gotten into<br />\ndrugs, but that's for high school. Or, I could have stayed<br />\nin school, and of those three alternatives, staying in school<br />\nwould have been the worst. I'm just glad I'm not in the<br />\nSoviet Union, where I would have had to stay in school<br />\nand suffer the consequences.\"<br />\nSasha Nyary says of taking time off, \"It was one<br />\nof the most important decisions I've made in my life. I'm<br />\na person who normally likes to learn for the sake of<br />\nlearning, but I was just going through the motions here<br />\nand my teachers knew it. I've never been too disciplined,<br />\nbut now that I'm out, I'm taking more responsibility<br />\nfor myself, making more decisions. I'm trying different<br />\nthings out, hoping something will come along and grab<br />\nme.\"<br />\nThere is no easy way to stereotype a person taking<br />\na leave of absence. He is not necessarily a Writing Seminars major seeking beauty and inner tranquility, or a<br />\npre-med going bananas under the academic pressure. In<br />\nfact, the only common denominator seems to be that he<br />\nsimply no longer feels like being in school.<br />\n\"I've been in school since I was five years old, and<br />\nat the age of twenty getting away seemed to be the logical<br />\nthing to do,\" says Pat Madden. \"The purpose of school<br />\nhad become blurred for me. I was just waiting for the end<br />\nof every class and every week - Hopkins was getting<br />\nawfully small.\"<br />\n<br />\nBeyond the Campus Gates...<br />\n\"They have horrible ideas about our pre-meds and doctors<br />\nthey think they're totally out for money. When you<br />\nstart arguing with them about that, it turns into an<br />\nargument about their system as opposed to our system<br />\nwhich can go on forever.\"<br />\nFinally, there are those who dream up occupations<br />\nbeyond the scope of the conventional year off. Sasha<br />\nNyary, who has been on leave since the first semester of<br />\nher freshman year, worked for several months on a<br />\nQuaker farm in Plymouth, Vermont, where she had<br />\npreviously gone to camp as a child.<br />\n\"One week I was at Hopkins, feeling miserable,\",<br />\nshe says. \"A week later I was up in Vermont, in the place<br />\nI'd dreamt about for years. It was blissful.\"<br />\nAnd Jeff Levy, for the first few months of his<br />\nleave, hit upon the strangest activity of all.<br />\n\"I engaged in sleep,\" he says. \"That was_a five<br />\nletter wprd which hadn't been in my vocabulary since I<br />\ncame to Hopkins.\"<br />\nWhy a Leave of Absence?<br />\nIn the office of Advising and Counseling, which<br />\ndeals with all leave-takers, there is a list of\"la's\"(people<br />\nwho have taken time off), and next to their names, a brief<br />\nreason for their leave. The reasons on the form are cryptic, saying no more than \"reassessment of goals\" or \"study<br />\n<br />\nThe Decision Process<br />\nWhile taking time off might seem like an easy<br />\ndecision to make, there are a number of people and<br />\nproblems to be dealt with along the way. Perhaps the<br />\nhardest of these to deal with are oneself and one's own<br />\nself-respect.<br />\n\"Leaving was hard on my self-esteem, in some<br />\nways,\" Nyary says. \"I come from an intellectual household, and all my friends are good students. I felt guilty<br />\nthat I wasn't interested, I felt that I should want to go to<br />\nschool. But it was obvious that I was unhappy, and I trust<br />\nmyself enough to know when I'm really not happy.\"<br />\n\"I got down on myself, but never past a certain<br />\npoint,\" Levy says. I half felt that I should stay in school<br />\nand discipline myself, but one thing about the accelerated<br />\nprogram I'm in, it teaches you not to adhere to strict<br />\nformulas. So just because I was doing poorly, I didn't tell<br />\nmyself 'I'm a screw up.' I told myself that this is a stage,<br />\nwhich I will pass through.\"<br />\nJoy Straus says she found Hopkins too difficult a<br />\n, place to make the personal changes necessary to revive her<br />\nacademic interest.<br />\n\"It's too easy to drown here, to become isolated<br />\nand anti-social,\" she says. \"So instead of trying to change<br />\nmyself here, I figured I would change my environment<br />\ninstead.\"<br />\nThe other self-imposed obstacle to taking time off<br />\nfrom school is often fear - fear of leaving friends, and a<br />\nknown,safe, comfortable environment.<br />\n\"I did have some fears about leaving,\" Straus says,<br />\n<br />\n\f\"but I knew that whatever was holding me here wasn't<br />\nhelping me to better myself.\"<br />\n\"It was scary for me to leave, because I had made<br />\nsome very good friends here very quickly - I think one<br />\ndoes that in college,\" Nyary says. \"My friendships are<br />\nvery important to me, and I was afraid I'd lose touch if I<br />\nwasn't living with people day to day. But when I left, my<br />\nfriends gave me a lot of support, enough so that I knew<br />\nthey would be thinking of me even if they didn't call or<br />\nwrite. And one friend of mine called me every weekend<br />\nfor the first few months that I was away. I really valued<br />\nthat connection.\"<br />\nThere is also a third kind of fear, which on a more<br />\nsubtle level, may be preventing some students from<br />\nrequesting a leave. It is the fear of the pre-professional<br />\nthat a decision to temporarily leave school will be viewed<br />\nas a strike against him by prospective employers or graduate schools.<br />\n\"I give no general advice about taking a leave of<br />\nabsence,\" says Dr. John Gryder, chairman of the university's Health Professions Recommendations Committee. \"I<br />\nthink it's an idiosyncratic thing, and how it will be viewed<br />\ndepends entirely upon your academic record, the kind of<br />\nimpression you make in an interview, and so on.\"<br />\nGryder says that medical schools have become<br />\n\"more accepting of people who take a different route,<br />\nperhaps because the people on their admissions committees have had their own kids, and are a little more sympathetic.\"<br />\nBut he adds that the impact of a leave upon a<br />\npre-med's record is \"a difficult thing to estimate, and<br />\npeople are reluctant to play around too much. That's<br />\nwhy there are so few who do it.\"<br />\nGryder says that a leave with a specific plan is<br />\ngenerally a better idea.<br />\n\"Most students don't take time off just to have<br />\nfun,\" he says. \"We had one fellow who travelled in<br />\nEurope, but he also managed to stop and work in a<br />\nlabortory in one country. He was able to present that<br />\nvery well.\"<br />\nOne student who is applying to med schools this<br />\nyear, senior William Lennarz, spent a year working in<br />\nAppalachia on a VISTA program, and says he believes it<br />\nimproved his chances.<br />\n\"For one thing, working with people day in and<br />\nday out changed my interest from veterinary medicine to<br />\npeople medicine.\" he says. \"I feel, and I was encouraged<br />\nby the administration here, that I'll make a better applicant and eventually, doctor, than people who have had a<br />\nsolely academic curriculum with no outside experience.\"<br />\nHowever, Lennarz says, he \"wouldn't have felt so<br />\nassured about taking a leave if I'd had no specific plans.\"<br />\nGryder says that medical schools are also sensitive<br />\nto leaves of absence occasioned by psychiatric problems.<br />\nHowever, psychiatric director Goddenne disagrees.<br />\n\"I've never known a single student to be refused<br />\nby medical schools because he had had psychiatric treatment,\" she,says. \"Sometimes the schools will write to the<br />\ntherapist asking for an opinion of the applicant. I tell<br />\nthem that a person who has had treatment is a better<br />\napplicant because he knows himself much better than<br />\nsomeone who hasn't.\"<br />\nGoddenne concedes that some pre-meds are<br />\nprobably scared away from seeking psychiatric help, and<br />\nsays \"It's too bad.\" But she argues that the reason that<br />\nfewer pre-meds seek leaves of absence is not fear or<br />\npressure, but simply that as a group, they have less of<br />\na need for time off.<br />\n\"Pre-meds have a better-formed identity than<br />\nmany liberal arts and political science majors, who could<br />\nbecome such a variety of things when they get out of<br />\nschool,\" she says. \"Pre-meds know what they are going to<br />\nbe, and they are more determined in their goals than<br />\nothers. And if it's not what they want they usually drop<br />\nit all together.\"<br />\nThe next step for the would-be absentee, after<br />\nselling himself, is to sell his parents on the idea. This can<br />\nbe a tricky business, especially given the rising cost of<br />\ntuition.<br />\n\"My parents, definitely objected at first,\" Levy<br />\nsays. \"They were afraid I wouldn't come back, and I guess<br />\nthey were also worried that I would set a precedent for not<br />\nfinishing things that I start. It was the whole Protestant<br />\nwork ethic thing.\"<br />\nLevy says that his parents did not impose a decision on him, nor was he, at the age of nineteen, rebelling<br />\nagainst them in leaving school.<br />\n\"They wouldn't have given me a flat 'no' in any<br />\ncase,\" he says, \"but I really valued their emotional support. As much as I want to believe otherwise, I'm still not<br />\ncompletely an adult, and their feelings about what I'm<br />\ndoing still mean a lot to me.\"<br />\nLevy says that family counseling proved an effective means of reconciling his parents to his intentions.<br />\n\"We had about twenty sessions, and it definitely<br />\nhelped my parents understand more clearly what I wanted<br />\nto do,\" he says. \"I think it was helpful just to have an<br />\noutside observer.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"My parents were upset about it in the beginning,\"<br />\nNyary says. \"My father was concerned about his investment. But my sister was a big advocate for it because she<br />\nhad done it, and my mother finally said, 'don't go to<br />\nschool just because it's Johns Hopkins University, there<br />\nare other things in life besides a college degree'.\"<br />\nThe final step in obtaining a leave of absence is<br />\ngetting permission from the Director of Advising and<br />\nCounseling, Martha 0. Roseman. Students are often<br />\nsurprised to find that this is the least difficult part of the<br />\nprocess.<br />\n\"Most of them come prepared for me to try to<br />\ndiscourage them, and they're surprised when,for the most<br />\npart, I don't,\" Roseman says.\"'No' is a word we use very<br />\nrarely in this office. And once they know they can do it,<br />\nit changes their attitude. They don't feel they have to do<br />\nit ri ht that very minute.\"<br />\nWw.<br />\n<br />\nhas no inherent optimism,\" says Jeff Levy. \"But it wasn't<br />\nsomething I wanted.\"<br />\nAcademic advisors, too, were not a resource<br />\ngreatly exploited by the absentees. The students seem to<br />\nhave made their decisions to take time off on their own,<br />\n3nd saw no need to consult the advisors.<br />\nComing Back<br />\nThe acid test of the leave of absence is, of course,<br />\nwhat the student decides to do afterward. Does he join<br />\nMrs. Roseman's conservative 85 percent and decide to<br />\ncome back? If so, is it harder or easier for him to assume<br />\nonce more the passive role of a student? If not, what does<br />\nhe do instead?<br />\nThe overwhelming consenus is that a leave of<br />\nabsence, whether or not by design, makes one a more<br />\ninterested, more focused student.<br />\n\"I'm excited about being back, because I have a<br />\nnew perspective on school,\" says Pat Madden. \"I view it<br />\nas a means to an end, and what's important is what I get<br />\nout of the discussions and lectures, not my grade on a<br />\ntest. I discriminate more in class, now, take out different<br />\nthings that I can use.\"<br />\n<br />\nMadden says her experience as an organizer<br />\nchanged her goals in studying social relations.<br />\n\"For one thing, I won't go the straight academic<br />\nroute anymore,\" she Says. \"I'm taking an internship in<br />\nurban planning this term. I also used to want to be a<br />\nsocial worker, play a saviour role, but now I would rather<br />\nplay the role of an agitator. The issues themselves are<br />\nnot as important as helping people deal with them.\"<br />\nMadden says her specific vocational plans are now<br />\nless clear, but the possibilities excite her. \"My experience<br />\ngave me more self-confidence,\" she says. \"I'm secure<br />\nknowing that I don't know what I'm going to cio with<br />\nmy life.\"<br />\nJoy Straus says that, for a variety of reasons, her<br />\nI experience made it easier for her to come back and be<br />\nIinterested in learning again.<br />\n-twanted a year to putz around, and do what I<br />\n\u2022<br />\nsays. \"Well, I've putzed, and done more or<br />\nshe<br />\nwanted,\"<br />\nless what I've wanted.

Fortunately, Baltimore<br />\nhas Henry Louis Mencken: wit, sage,<br />\ncurmudgeon - the perfect antidote to our<br />\ngutless and rather depressing times.<br />\nThis Friday, Mencken fans will celebrate<br />\nthe master's centennial with a wide<br />\nvariety of activities at the Enoch Pratt<br />\nLibrary, ranging from the opening of<br />\nthe H.L. Mencken room, featuring books<br />\nand memorabilia, to two sold-out banquets with Alistair Cooke as host. This is<br />\nan ideal time to celebrate Mencken, for<br />\ngritty iconoclasm complements Baltimore's equally gritty revitalization<br />\nefforts.<br />\nH.L. Mencken was pure Baltimore<br />\nand never forgot it. He was born on<br />\nSeptember 12, 1880, in a house on W.<br />\nLexington St. When Henry was three the<br />\nMenckens moved to 1524 Hollins; Mencken spent almost his entire life at this<br />\naddress, except during his marriage,from<br />\n1930 to 1935, when he lived on Cathedral St. His childhood was a blissful<br />\nsuccession of youthful frolics and impressive academic achievements, culminating<br />\nwith his graduation from Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nPolytechnic at 16 with high honors.<br />\nMencken did not enter the literary<br />\nworld immediately. His father owned<br />\na cigar factory and tried to bring the sons<br />\ninto the business. Although Henry's<br />\nbrother August joined the firm, Henry<br />\nwas far more interested in cigar consumption than production. Perhaps to please<br />\nhis father, Mencken spent a few miserable<br />\nyears at the trade. He left in 1899,after<br />\nhis father's death, and went to work for<br />\nthe long-defunct Baltimore Herald.<br />\nThe Herald job marked the start<br />\nof a long and illustrious journalistic<br />\nWithin three years Mencken<br />\ncareer.<br />\nadvanced from Southern police district<br />\nreporter to city editor. As city editor he<br />\nshepherded the paper through the crisis<br />\ncaused by the great fire of 1904, publishing from as far away as Washington and<br />\nA few years later the<br />\nPhiladelphia.<br />\nHerald closed and Mencken switched to<br />\nthe Sun, first as Sunday editor, then to<br />\nthe editorial page of the newly formed<br />\nEvening Sun. He soon afterward began a<br />\ncolumn, \"The Free Lance\", which ran<br />\nuntil 1917. In 1920 Mencken returned<br />\nwith a series of Monday evening columns,<br />\nand he continued writing for the Monday<br />\nEvening Sun until 1938. The columns<br />\nwere a potpourri of Mencken's particular<br />\nlikes and dislikes, especially concerning<br />\nhis beloved Maryland cuisine, the city's<br />\n(and nation's) bumbling politicians, his<br />\ncharacter archetype, and idyllic Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nA\\IR1Sr<br />\n<br />\nof the 'eighties and 'nineties.<br />\nMencken's most enduring fame<br />\ncame from his magazine pieces and<br />\nbooks. In 1908 he began writing literary<br />\ncriticism for The Smart Set, a New<br />\nHe continued<br />\nYorker-like magazine.<br />\nwriting for the Smart Set, eventually<br />\nbecoming co-editor with drama critic<br />\nGeorge Jean Nathan in 1914. He and<br />\nNathan went on to found The American<br />\nMercury in 1924. which soon rose to<br />\nprominence as one of America's foremost<br />\nliterary magazines. Mencken co-edited<br />\nthe Mercury until 1933, when his interests shifted to political - writing. He<br />\ncovered all political conventions with<br />\ngusto until suffering a stroke in late 1948<br />\nwhich left him unable to read or write.<br />\n<br />\nAlong with a busy career of<br />\nnewspaper and magazine work Mencken<br />\nalso found time to write several books.<br />\nThese included a history of the Suvapers, the Prejudices Series, which sprawled over six volumes, and a treatise, The<br />\nAmerican Language. among many others.<br />\nIn later years the books became more<br />\nnostalgic, continuing a trend Mencken<br />\nhad established as far back as the twenties. During the forties Mencken published the \"Days\" books: Happy Days,<br />\nabout his childhood, Newspaper Days, his<br />\nearly history with the Herald and Sun,<br />\nand Heathen Days, which covered his<br />\nlater life and literary exploits. Unfortunately, the books were never as popular<br />\nas his columns and magazine pieces, and<br />\nKnopf, his publisher, has yet to reap great<br />\nprofits from a Mencken book. This<br />\nFriday Knopf will try again with the<br />\npublication of A Choice of Days, a<br />\n\"greatest hits\" collection of critical pieces<br />\non Mencken by Alistair Cooke, William<br />\nManchester, Huntington Cairns, Malcolm<br />\nMoos, Carl Bode, and others.<br />\n<br />\n.%<br />\n<br />\nRich Chang<br />\n<br />\nBY JAMES SHULMAN<br />\n<br />\n\"Forgive some sinner and wink<br />\nyour eye at some homely girl\"<br />\nated wildly over the years. from its<br />\nzenith during the twenties to a rather<br />\npainful wane during the Depression.<br />\nProbably the most constant element in<br />\nMencken's popularity is Mencken himself.<br />\nHe resolutely stood by his convictions largely conservative - and steadfastly<br />\nmaintained that most men are and likely<br />\nwill always be boobs.

However,<br />\nmore than eighty of your fellow students during the past<br />\ntwo years did not keep walking, or if they did, at least<br />\ncontinued to turn the idea over in their minds during the<br />\nensuing chem lecture.<br />\nThese are the students v,;:io have taken or are<br />\ncurrently on a leave of absence from the university. Their<br />\nactivities range from such \"non-intellectual\" pursuits as<br />\ngrape-picking and selling beer at Memorial Stadium to<br />\ncommunity organizing in a low-income<br />\nneighborhood<br />\nand social relations study at an overseas institution. They<br />\nrepresent a variety of different majors, interests, and<br />\ntemperaments, but all agree that their time off was time<br />\nwell spent. And most report that their leaves of absence<br />\ndramatically affected<br />\ntheir perspectives on Johns<br />\nHopkins University and on education in general.<br /><br />\nalso true that Johns Hopkins has a good name, and that as<br />\na student here you are considered high quality material,\"<br />\nshe says. \"If you'rc willing to work to get a job, write the<br />\nletters and sell yourself, then you can get it.\"<br />\nBaughn believes that holding a job in an area of<br />\ninterest can be a very exciting thing to do with a year off.<br />\n\"Waitressing or bartending can be fun to do for<br />\nawhile, because it's something different,\" she says. \"But<br />\nan eight-to-five job, with an hour for lunch, using the<br />\nskills you've learned - that's really an experience.\"<br />\nStill others chose to study abroad. Joy Straus also<br />\nspent five months at a school in Israel.<br />\n\"I wanted to study religion, and not get the usual<br />\nwatered-down version,\" -she says. \"I figured Israel would<br />\nbe the right place to do it.\"<br />\nStraus said the intellectual level of her classmates<br />\nthere made her appreciate Hopkins' students more.<br />\n\"They'd begin all these good discussions, and then<br />\nnot be able to take them anywhere,\" slie says. \"I was one<br />\nof the smartest people there, which was nice for my ego,<br />\nbut a burden otherwise.\"<br /><br />\nabroad.\" However, Dr. Ghislaine Goddenne, director of<br />\ncounseling and psychiatric services at Hopkins, says<br />\nshe believes that the motivation for taking a leave of<br />\nabsence is often deep-seated and extremely important.<br />\n\"The student taking time off is often someone<br />\nwho has not yet formed an identity,\" she says. \"He is<br />\nseeking a moratorium,.to borrow a term from Erickson - a<br />\ntime when they can stand still and find out who they are.<br />\nThis is not something which is achieved easily or peacefully, but it is something which the student must do.\"<br />\nThe search for identity seems to begin before the<br />\nperson is consciously aware of it, and to affect the motivation and performance of even the most enthusiastic<br />\nstudent.<br />\n\"I'm a self-starter, a task-driver, and I actually<br />\nused to like to study,\" says Jeff Levy, who entered<br />\nHopkins at the age of sixteen, in an accelerated mathematics program. \"But it suddenly isn't fun anymore.<br />\nI'm just accelerating, without a goal, with my eyes straight<br />\non the road ahead and no chance to look around.

Every time I<br />\nthought I was going to come home,something new would<br />\ncome along - like Egypt, or Italy. I'd still be going yet<br />\nif it wasn't so difficult getting from place to place.\"<br />\nHelen Hall-Craggs, a languages major who actually<br />\ndid pick grapes in southern France, also<br />\nlived with a<br />\nfamily there.<br />\n\"It was great to see the country that way,\" she<br />\nsays. \"I think they were much more accepting of me than<br />\nIf I had been a tourist.\"<br />\nAnd Chip Carlson, a junior majoring in political<br />\neconomy, held a variety of jobs during his year off which<br />\nenabled him to travel to California, the Florida Keys, and<br />\nNew Orleans.<br />\n\"I waited on tables, I sold beer at the Orioles<br />\ngames,\" he says. \"I'm still doing that, It's a good job to<br />\nhave while school's on, because they play away half the<br />\ntime and you can get your work done.\"<br />\nOthers pursued jobs which related directly to their<br />\nacademic interests. Patricia Madden, a senior majoring in<br />\nsocial relations, worked as a community organizer with a<br />\nVISTA-funded citizens' organization in South Bethlehem,<br />\nPennsylvania.<br />\n\"We were basically trying to give the people of<br />\nSouth Bethlehem a voice on issues such as housing, crime,<br />\nhealth, and use of development funds,\" she says. \"The<br />\nidea was not to tell the people what to do, but to find out<br />\nwhat they wanted to do, and help them do it. I would<br />\ngo around from door to door, asking people who'd never<br />\nseen me before how they felt about the glass, the rowdies,<br />\nand the drugs over in the neighborhood park. Once they<br />\ngot rolling, they couldn't get mad enough, and you'd end<br />\nup talking to them for an hour.\"<br />\nMadden says she received three days of training for<br />\nthe job, which she got through a friend in the VISTA<br />\nprogram. There were no academic or experience requirements for the job. VISTA payed her a salary of<br />\n$135 every two weeks, plus a stipend of $75 a month.<br />\n\"They want you to live on. a level close to that of<br />\nthe people you're working with,\" she says. \u2022<br />\nJeff Levy, a junior seeking a degree in math and<br />\nphysics, is currently on leave, applying for jobs with<br />\nairplane and computer manufacturing companies. \"It'll<br />\nbe enough of a change of pace from school and I may be able to<br />\nfind work with a company that I can come back to when I'm<br />\nout of school,\" he says.<br />\nLevy has unique qualifications for jobs in his field.<br />\nHe has already completed the undergraduate requirements<br />\nfor a degree in math despite the fact that he still hasn't<br />\ngraduated. However, Hopkins job placement director<br />\nSharon BaUghn says that good jobs are within reach of<br />\nany student on a year off.<br />\n\"It can be tough, because employers are often<br />\nreluctant to invest time in training you when they know<br />\nthey're going to lose you after a year,\" she says. \"But it's<br /><br />\nII1<br />\nI<br /><br />\ni<br /><br />\nNM EMI M MIN MII=INN NM INN NM EN M in<br /><br />\n\"I could have gone to pieces, but that didn't seem<br />\nlike a very good idea,\" he says. \"I could have gotten into<br />\ndrugs, but that's for high school. Or, I could have stayed<br />\nin school, and of those three alternatives, staying in school<br />\nwould have been the worst. I'm just glad I'm not in the<br />\nSoviet Union, where I would have had to stay in school<br />\nand suffer the consequences.\"<br />\nSasha Nyary says of taking time off, \"It was one<br />\nof the most important decisions I've made in my life. I'm<br />\na person who normally likes to learn for the sake of<br />\nlearning, but I was just going through the motions here<br />\nand my teachers knew it. I've never been too disciplined,<br />\nbut now that I'm out, I'm taking more responsibility<br />\nfor myself, making more decisions. I'm trying different<br />\nthings out, hoping something will come along and grab<br />\nme.\"<br />\nThere is no easy way to stereotype a person taking<br />\na leave of absence. He is not necessarily a Writing Seminars major seeking beauty and inner tranquility, or a<br />\npre-med going bananas under the academic pressure. In<br />\nfact, the only common denominator seems to be that he<br />\nsimply no longer feels like being in school.<br />\n\"I've been in school since I was five years old, and<br />\nat the age of twenty getting away seemed to be the logical<br />\nthing to do,\" says Pat Madden. \"The purpose of school<br />\nhad become blurred for me. I was just waiting for the end<br />\nof every class and every week - Hopkins was getting<br />\nawfully small.\"<br /><br />\nBeyond the Campus Gates...<br />\n\"They have horrible ideas about our pre-meds and doctors<br />\nthey think they're totally out for money. When you<br />\nstart arguing with them about that, it turns into an<br />\nargument about their system as opposed to our system<br />\nwhich can go on forever.\"<br />\nFinally, there are those who dream up occupations<br />\nbeyond the scope of the conventional year off. Sasha<br />\nNyary, who has been on leave since the first semester of<br />\nher freshman year, worked for several months on a<br />\nQuaker farm in Plymouth, Vermont, where she had<br />\npreviously gone to camp as a child.<br />\n\"One week I was at Hopkins, feeling miserable,\",<br />\nshe says. \"A week later I was up in Vermont, in the place<br />\nI'd dreamt about for years. It was blissful.\"<br />\nAnd Jeff Levy, for the first few months of his<br />\nleave, hit upon the strangest activity of all.<br />\n\"I engaged in sleep,\" he says. \"That was_a five<br />\nletter wprd which hadn't been in my vocabulary since I<br />\ncame to Hopkins.\"<br />\nWhy a Leave of Absence?<br />\nIn the office of Advising and Counseling, which<br />\ndeals with all leave-takers, there is a list of\"la's\"(people<br />\nwho have taken time off), and next to their names, a brief<br />\nreason for their leave. The reasons on the form are cryptic, saying no more than \"reassessment of goals\" or \"study<br /><br />\nThe Decision Process<br />\nWhile taking time off might seem like an easy<br />\ndecision to make, there are a number of people and<br />\nproblems to be dealt with along the way. Perhaps the<br />\nhardest of these to deal with are oneself and one's own<br />\nself-respect.<br />\n\"Leaving was hard on my self-esteem, in some<br />\nways,\" Nyary says. \"I come from an intellectual household, and all my friends are good students. I felt guilty<br />\nthat I wasn't interested, I felt that I should want to go to<br />\nschool. But it was obvious that I was unhappy, and I trust<br />\nmyself enough to know when I'm really not happy.\"<br />\n\"I got down on myself, but never past a certain<br />\npoint,\" Levy says. I half felt that I should stay in school<br />\nand discipline myself, but one thing about the accelerated<br />\nprogram I'm in, it teaches you not to adhere to strict<br />\nformulas. So just because I was doing poorly, I didn't tell<br />\nmyself 'I'm a screw up.' I told myself that this is a stage,<br />\nwhich I will pass through.\"<br />\nJoy Straus says she found Hopkins too difficult a<br />\n, place to make the personal changes necessary to revive her<br />\nacademic interest.<br />\n\"It's too easy to drown here, to become isolated<br />\nand anti-social,\" she says. \"So instead of trying to change<br />\nmyself here, I figured I would change my environment<br />\ninstead.\"<br />\nThe other self-imposed obstacle to taking time off<br />\nfrom school is often fear - fear of leaving friends, and a<br />\nknown,safe, comfortable environment.<br />\n\"I did have some fears about leaving,\" Straus says,<br /><br />\n\"but I knew that whatever was holding me here wasn't<br />\nhelping me to better myself.\"<br />\n\"It was scary for me to leave, because I had made<br />\nsome very good friends here very quickly - I think one<br />\ndoes that in college,\" Nyary says. \"My friendships are<br />\nvery important to me, and I was afraid I'd lose touch if I<br />\nwasn't living with people day to day. But when I left, my<br />\nfriends gave me a lot of support, enough so that I knew<br />\nthey would be thinking of me even if they didn't call or<br />\nwrite. And one friend of mine called me every weekend<br />\nfor the first few months that I was away. I really valued<br />\nthat connection.\"<br />\nThere is also a third kind of fear, which on a more<br />\nsubtle level, may be preventing some students from<br />\nrequesting a leave. It is the fear of the pre-professional<br />\nthat a decision to temporarily leave school will be viewed<br />\nas a strike against him by prospective employers or graduate schools.<br />\n\"I give no general advice about taking a leave of<br />\nabsence,\" says Dr. John Gryder, chairman of the university's Health Professions Recommendations Committee. \"I<br />\nthink it's an idiosyncratic thing, and how it will be viewed<br />\ndepends entirely upon your academic record, the kind of<br />\nimpression you make in an interview, and so on.\"<br />\nGryder says that medical schools have become<br />\n\"more accepting of people who take a different route,<br />\nperhaps because the people on their admissions committees have had their own kids, and are a little more sympathetic.\"<br />\nBut he adds that the impact of a leave upon a<br />\npre-med's record is \"a difficult thing to estimate, and<br />\npeople are reluctant to play around too much. That's<br />\nwhy there are so few who do it.\"<br />\nGryder says that a leave with a specific plan is<br />\ngenerally a better idea.<br />\n\"Most students don't take time off just to have<br />\nfun,\" he says. \"We had one fellow who travelled in<br />\nEurope, but he also managed to stop and work in a<br />\nlabortory in one country. He was able to present that<br />\nvery well.\"<br />\nOne student who is applying to med schools this<br />\nyear, senior William Lennarz, spent a year working in<br />\nAppalachia on a VISTA program, and says he believes it<br />\nimproved his chances.<br />\n\"For one thing, working with people day in and<br />\nday out changed my interest from veterinary medicine to<br />\npeople medicine.\" he says. \"I feel, and I was encouraged<br />\nby the administration here, that I'll make a better applicant and eventually, doctor, than people who have had a<br />\nsolely academic curriculum with no outside experience.\"<br />\nHowever, Lennarz says, he \"wouldn't have felt so<br />\nassured about taking a leave if I'd had no specific plans.\"<br />\nGryder says that medical schools are also sensitive<br />\nto leaves of absence occasioned by psychiatric problems.<br />\nHowever, psychiatric director Goddenne disagrees.<br />\n\"I've never known a single student to be refused<br />\nby medical schools because he had had psychiatric treatment,\" she,says. \"Sometimes the schools will write to the<br />\ntherapist asking for an opinion of the applicant. I tell<br />\nthem that a person who has had treatment is a better<br />\napplicant because he knows himself much better than<br />\nsomeone who hasn't.\"<br />\nGoddenne concedes that some pre-meds are<br />\nprobably scared away from seeking psychiatric help, and<br />\nsays \"It's too bad.\" But she argues that the reason that<br />\nfewer pre-meds seek leaves of absence is not fear or<br />\npressure, but simply that as a group, they have less of<br />\na need for time off.<br />\n\"Pre-meds have a better-formed identity than<br />\nmany liberal arts and political science majors, who could<br />\nbecome such a variety of things when they get out of<br />\nschool,\" she says. \"Pre-meds know what they are going to<br />\nbe, and they are more determined in their goals than<br />\nothers. And if it's not what they want they usually drop<br />\nit all together.\"<br />\nThe next step for the would-be absentee, after<br />\nselling himself, is to sell his parents on the idea. This can<br />\nbe a tricky business, especially given the rising cost of<br />\ntuition.<br />\n\"My parents, definitely objected at first,\" Levy<br />\nsays. \"They were afraid I wouldn't come back, and I guess<br />\nthey were also worried that I would set a precedent for not<br />\nfinishing things that I start. It was the whole Protestant<br />\nwork ethic thing.\"<br />\nLevy says that his parents did not impose a decision on him, nor was he, at the age of nineteen, rebelling<br />\nagainst them in leaving school.<br />\n\"They wouldn't have given me a flat 'no' in any<br />\ncase,\" he says, \"but I really valued their emotional support. As much as I want to believe otherwise, I'm still not<br />\ncompletely an adult, and their feelings about what I'm<br />\ndoing still mean a lot to me.\"<br />\nLevy says that family counseling proved an effective means of reconciling his parents to his intentions.<br />\n\"We had about twenty sessions, and it definitely<br />\nhelped my parents understand more clearly what I wanted<br />\nto do,\" he says. \"I think it was helpful just to have an<br />\noutside observer.\"<br /><br />\n\"My parents were upset about it in the beginning,\"<br />\nNyary says. \"My father was concerned about his investment. But my sister was a big advocate for it because she<br />\nhad done it, and my mother finally said, 'don't go to<br />\nschool just because it's Johns Hopkins University, there<br />\nare other things in life besides a college degree'.\"<br />\nThe final step in obtaining a leave of absence is<br />\ngetting permission from the Director of Advising and<br />\nCounseling, Martha 0. Roseman. Students are often<br />\nsurprised to find that this is the least difficult part of the<br />\nprocess.<br />\n\"Most of them come prepared for me to try to<br />\ndiscourage them, and they're surprised when,for the most<br />\npart, I don't,\" Roseman says.\"'No' is a word we use very<br />\nrarely in this office. And once they know they can do it,<br />\nit changes their attitude. They don't feel they have to do<br />\nit ri ht that very minute.\"<br />\nWw.<br /><br />\nhas no inherent optimism,\" says Jeff Levy. \"But it wasn't<br />\nsomething I wanted.\"<br />\nAcademic advisors, too, were not a resource<br />\ngreatly exploited by the absentees.

Does he join<br />\nMrs. Roseman's conservative 85 percent and decide to<br />\ncome back? If so, is it harder or easier for him to assume<br />\nonce more the passive role of a student? If not, what does<br />\nhe do instead?<br />\nThe overwhelming consenus is that a leave of<br />\nabsence, whether or not by design, makes one a more<br />\ninterested, more focused student.<br />\n\"I'm excited about being back, because I have a<br />\nnew perspective on school,\" says Pat Madden. \"I view it<br />\nas a means to an end, and what's important is what I get<br />\nout of the discussions and lectures, not my grade on a<br />\ntest.

Fortunately, Baltimore<br />\nhas Henry Louis Mencken: wit, sage,<br />\ncurmudgeon - the perfect antidote to our<br />\ngutless and rather depressing times.<br />\nThis Friday, Mencken fans will celebrate<br />\nthe master's centennial with a wide<br />\nvariety of activities at the Enoch Pratt<br />\nLibrary, ranging from the opening of<br />\nthe H.L. Mencken room, featuring books<br />\nand memorabilia, to two sold-out banquets with Alistair Cooke as host. This is<br />\nan ideal time to celebrate Mencken, for<br />\ngritty iconoclasm complements Baltimore's equally gritty revitalization<br />\nefforts.<br />\nH.L. Mencken was pure Baltimore<br />\nand never forgot it. He was born on<br />\nSeptember 12, 1880, in a house on W.<br />\nLexington St. When Henry was three the<br />\nMenckens moved to 1524 Hollins; Mencken spent almost his entire life at this<br />\naddress, except during his marriage,from<br />\n1930 to 1935, when he lived on Cathedral St. His childhood was a blissful<br />\nsuccession of youthful frolics and impressive academic achievements, culminating<br />\nwith his graduation from Baltimore<br /><br />\nPolytechnic at 16 with high honors.<br />\nMencken did not enter the literary<br />\nworld immediately. His father owned<br />\na cigar factory and tried to bring the sons<br />\ninto the business. Although Henry's<br />\nbrother August joined the firm, Henry<br />\nwas far more interested in cigar consumption than production. Perhaps to please<br />\nhis father, Mencken spent a few miserable<br />\nyears at the trade. He left in 1899,after<br />\nhis father's death, and went to work for<br />\nthe long-defunct Baltimore Herald.<br />\nThe Herald job marked the start<br />\nof a long and illustrious journalistic<br />\nWithin three years Mencken<br />\ncareer.<br />\nadvanced from Southern police district<br />\nreporter to city editor. As city editor he<br />\nshepherded the paper through the crisis<br />\ncaused by the great fire of 1904, publishing from as far away as Washington and<br />\nA few years later the<br />\nPhiladelphia.<br />\nHerald closed and Mencken switched to<br />\nthe Sun, first as Sunday editor, then to<br />\nthe editorial page of the newly formed<br />\nEvening Sun. He soon afterward began a<br />\ncolumn, \"The Free Lance\", which ran<br />\nuntil 1917. In 1920 Mencken returned<br />\nwith a series of Monday evening columns,<br />\nand he continued writing for the Monday<br />\nEvening Sun until 1938. The columns<br />\nwere a potpourri of Mencken's particular<br />\nlikes and dislikes, especially concerning<br />\nhis beloved Maryland cuisine, the city's<br />\n(and nation's) bumbling politicians, his<br />\ncharacter archetype, and idyllic Baltimore<br /><br />\nA\\IR1Sr<br /><br />\nof the 'eighties and 'nineties.<br />\nMencken's most enduring fame<br />\ncame from his magazine pieces and<br />\nbooks.

During the forties Mencken published the \"Days\" books: Happy Days,<br />\nabout his childhood, Newspaper Days, his<br />\nearly history with the Herald and Sun,<br />\nand Heathen Days, which covered his<br />\nlater life and literary exploits.

I am of<br />\ncourse speaking of the fine<br />\nMaryland tradition of thoroughbred horse racing. As Spectacular Bid wins race after race,<br />\nracing fans the world over are<br />\nreminded that Kentucky is not<br />\nthe only place in the U.S. where<br />\nhorses are bred. Baltimore's<br /><br />\ncontribution to the art of racing<br />\nis located just a bit northwest of<br />\nHopkins at Pimlico Race Track.<br />\nThe track opens its season in the<br />\nmiddle of March and highlights<br />\nit with the Preakness Stakes, run<br />\nthe third Saturday in May.<br />\nSo, although Howard Cosell<br />\nmay not believe it, Baltimore is<br />\nhere as a Major League city, and<br />\nwhile you're here, you should<br />\ngo right out and try to enjoy it.<br /><br />\nSports Comment<br /><br />\nMove It On Over, Chuck!<br />\nOriole announcer Chuck<br />\nThompson recently commented,<br />\n\"More ladies than ever are going<br />\nto the ballpark these days.\" He<br />\nwent on to add, \"And they<br />\naren't only going to stare at the<br />\nplayers, either. Quite a few of<br />\nour female spectators are knowledgeable about the game of<br />\nbaseball.\"<br />\nWhat does he expect? The<br />\nMiss America Pageant, if held<br />\nevery night, would attract few<br />\nconstant viewers. Even the most<br />\ncrush-ridden teenager, complete<br />\nwith a T-shirt bearing her favorite's name and number, can't<br />\nhelp but pick up the rudiments<br />\nof her hero's game. The more<br />\noften she goes, the more she<br />\nlearns - not to mention the trivia<br />\nshe picks up from listening to<br />\nthe announcers during televised<br />\ngames.<br />\nThe days of the stereotypical sports-stupid female, accompanying her boyfriend to a<br />\ngame only to sigh of boredom<br />\nand ask dumb questions, are<br />\nWomen are not only<br />\nover.<br />\nlearning the fine points of sports<br />\nspectatorship, they are also<br />\nturning out in record numbers<br />\nfor intense athletic competition.<br /><br />\nFor several years now, the<br />\nmajor universities (and many of<br />\nthe minor ones) have worked<br />\nhard to upgrade women's athletics to equality with men's.<br />\nThe gulf between the two is still<br />\nnoticeable, but with improved<br />\nfunding, staffing, and recruiting,<br />\nwomen's sports are coming into<br />\ntheir own. Here at Hopkins, the<br />\nturnout of freshman women for<br />\nvarious sports is a result fo this<br />\nnew awareness.<br />\nChuck Thompson may be<br />\nsurprised by the number of<br /><br />\nwomen with baseball savvy, but<br />\nhe shouldn't be. The days of<br />\nstereotyped male/female recreations have come to an end.<br />\nInterests are chosen now on a far<br />\nmore personal, individual basis.<br />\nA woman who takes an interest<br />\nin sports is no longer a \"tomboy\", or an \"annie\", she's a<br />\nteam member or a fan.<br />\nMove over, Chuck. You<br />\nmay be sharing your booth with<br />\na female announcer - sooner<br />\nthan you think.<br />\nA.J.
