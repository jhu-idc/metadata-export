It seems as if this issue has<br />\nbrought everyone out of the woodwork, from Reagan<br />\nsupporters to something entitled the Revolutionary<br />\nStudent Brigade. (Dixie Dick, a man well versed in military parlance, informs us that a brigade usually has about<br />\n5000 people in it. Wow! With membership like that you<br />\npeople can start your own school!) Now that the student<br />\nbody has been assaulted by polemics from the opposing<br />\ntrenches, a little moderation is in order., Also, since this<br />\nweek the News-Letter has been accused of being a mere<br />\npuppet of the \"Chet Set,\" it is time for us to state our<br />\nposition.<br />\nIt is very easy to say that politics and religion should<br />\nnot mix; that the Chaplain's Office should not soil its<br />\nsupposedly pious fingers by digging in the secular sandbox.<br />\nIt is well-nigh impossible, however, to put such a program<br />\ninto action. People, no matter what campus organization<br />\nthey work for, are bound to hold political opinions of one<br />\nsort or another. These opinions will inevitably4and perhaps unconciouslykolor the manner in which they go<br />\nabout their business. To ask the members of the Chaplain's Office to erase all political opinions from their minds<br />\nis to ask for too much. Conscience and religion, it is to be<br />\nhoped, will never become mutually exclusive in the minds<br />\nof those who claim spiritual authority, and when their<br />\nconscience is disturbed by secular events, we cannot<br />\nrightfully condemn them for acting as the rest of us do<br />\nunder similar circumstances.<br />\nA distinction must be made, however, between the<br />\nindividuals in the Chaplain's Office and the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice as an organization. As we stated above, the leanings<br />\nof the indiviauals must be expected to manifest themselves<br />\nin the policies, of the group to some extent. The trouble<br />\nwith the Cahplain's Office, however, is that this natural<br />\nproclivity has gotten completely out of hand.<br />\nThe Office claims that it will assist any program<br />\nwhich it feels will be of benefit to mankind, regardless of<br />\nthat program's position in the political spectrum. Oh<br />\nyeah? A few of us have been here over three years now,<br />\nand we haven't seen it yet. No matter what they claim,<br />\nthe Office has become synonymous with left-of-center<br />\npolitical groups. This we can rightfully condemn, and<br />\nrightfully demand that they change it. Politically conservative groups must begin approaching the Chaplain's<br />\nchallenge them to live up to their promise,<br />\nEntourage,<br />\nand to raise a lot of Hell if they don't. Actually, it is not<br />\nenough for the Office to sit back and wait for such groups<br />\nto approach them \u2014 rather, they must actively solicit their<br />\nparticipation. After all, the Office has allowed its image to<br />\ntarnish and the Office must do something to correct the<br />\nsituation.<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office represents the University as a<br />\nwhole \u2014 that means all the students, not just registered<br />\nDemocrats. \u2022The Office has become polarized and narrowminded; and hence a large group of students are simply not<br />\ngetting their money's worth. \"Equal-Time\" is not just an<br />\nempty phrase. What it should be is the guiding principle<br />\nof any organization which claims to represent Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWe are not saying that those who espouse left-wing<br />\npolitical -views are wrong. We are saying that when such<br />\npeople come to monopolize a University Office which<br />\neveryone pays for, then somebody is getting screwed. The<br />\nChaplain's Office must begin to make good on its claim -because unless God publicly endorses Teddy Kennedy<br />\npretty soon, its put up or shut up time.<br />\n<br />\ngroups certainly advocate preferential treatment, while the<br />\nKlan and the Nazis actually<br />\nadvocate dis-preferential treatment. This is but a small example of the infinite hypocrisy of<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office political<br />\ninvolvement. I need not go<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nfurther.

Gig A Hit<br />\nby Kevil Duhon<br />\n<br />\nThere were over 175,000 of us there -- American,<br />\nmostly younger Catholics come to see a' Polish pope say<br />\nmass on the Mall in Washington. Perhaps those older<br />\nthan I could remember the great demonstrations of the<br />\nSixties, which took place on that very spot. For me,the<br />\nclosest point of comparison was last Spring's anti-nuke<br />\nrally on the Capital grounds. Thers, about half as many<br />\npeople gathered for an almost light-hearted festival of<br />\nbig-name musicians and big-name speakers. While most<br />\nof the demonstrators had undoubtedly come to voice<br />\ntheir opposition to nuclear energy, one could not<br />\nunderestimate the drawing power of Jackson Browne,<br />\nJane Fonda,and a beautiful Spring afternoon. This Mass<br />\non the Mallswassmade of sterner stuff. Pope John Paul II<br />\nhad comesto do nothing less than shepherd his wayward<br />\nflock back to the fold of Roman Catholicism. Judging<br />\nfrom the reactions of the majority in Washington and all<br />\nalong the papal route, a stern, fatherly shepherd is<br />\nexactly what American Catholics want.<br />\nOur own Father Donahue, whose Catholic<br />\nCommunity on Campus supplied the largest group on<br />\nthe train (some 100 ticket-holders), found himself the<br />\nwitting victim of a News American interrogator and<br />\nphotographer. \"Cap\", as he is known to many on<br />\ncampus, managed to stage several shotss of C.C.O.C.<br />\nmembers, ands to get quoteds asfew times in the next<br />\nday's paper (under the alias of \"Rev. Donaghue\").<br />\nInstant celebrity came to that poor niche of the<br />\ntrain which was occupied by my companions and myself<br />\nwhen the previously mentioned reporter found a rare<br />\nempty seat (mine), and fell into it. Skip Landry and I<br />\nboth made it into his notebook, but were cut after<br />\nthat first step, apparently for comments too mundane.<br />\nI found myself bumming paper and pen off<br />\nwhomever I could -- an especially embarrassing task for a<br />\nyoung reporter tryingsto emulate the swarthy independence of Jack Andersonsor Ernest Hemingway. I thought<br />\nsure I had packed that note pad in the pack along<br />\nwith the sandwiches and raincoat.<br />\nAll this preoccupation with the press disappeared<br />\nas soon as we disembarked at Union Station in Washington. I left all notions of note-taking, as well as any<br />\npresumed intellectual disinterestedness in the coming<br />\nproceedings on the train for safe-keeping. This pilgrim<br />\ncovered those seven blocks to the Mali as fast as any of<br />\nmy fellows, and faster than some.<br />\nArriving at noon for a Mass that was not to begin<br />\nuntil 4:00, we looked for ways to pass the time. At<br />\nfirst, intent on getting a good look at the Pope, we<br />\nfought our way into the dense core of the people<br />\n<br />\nthronged directly m front of the altar. Conditions there<br />\nwere tight, to say the least. Closed in by the crowd, we<br />\nwere soon immobilized. Luckily, we were able to jump<br />\ninto the wake of a lady with a baby carriage, for whom<br />\nthe crowd opened up. A tetreat -to the fringe brought an<br />\nopportunity to eat our picnic lunch,listen to folk music<br />\ncoming falteringly over the public address system, and<br />\nobserve the crowd.<br />\nPope buttons, pictures, caps, flags, T-shirts,<br />\ncalendars, etx. rapidly changed hands at high prices early<br />\nin the afternoon, but as the weather began to dampen<br />\nthe turn-out, prices fell at a proportionate rate. While<br />\nmany were disgusted by the commercialization, there<br />\nwas also the strong desire for souvenoirs of this momentous occasion. When the price fell to two large buttons<br />\nfor a dollar, even this cub reporter found it altogether<br />\ntoo tempting. Popular button slogans included: \"John<br />\nPau! II, I love you,\" \"Kiss me, I'm Polish,\" and certain<br />\nPolish inscriptions which I could not fathom.<br />\nProbably the strangest slogan on the Mall Sunday<br />\nwas displayed on the banner brought by Hopkins.<br />\nWritten in New Testament Greek characters, the message<br />\nmeant, \"Hearty Greetings in the Lord.\" Two hearty<br />\nstandard-bearers chased after the TV crews, essaying to<br />\nhave their unusual sign recorded for posterity as a part<br />\nof this unusual Mass.<br />\nAt 3:00, when the Pope was supposed to start<br />\nthe Mass, the sun broke through the clouds and received<br />\na brief applause from the onlookers below. ,Something<br />\nfrom my Catholic heritage stirred in me to think that<br />\nthe clouds would dissipate and light shine through with<br />\nthe arrival of the Pope, but such romantisism was soon<br />\ndispelled.<br />\nBy this time, the hoopla which accompanies any<br />\nlarge gathering in this country had given way to a certain<br />\nanxiety in the crowd. Skip and I, separated from our<br />\nco-picnicers, began jockeying for a better position. We<br />\nsettled on a spot directly opposite the altar, on the other<br />\nside of the Mall. A tree stood directly between us and<br />\nthe papal chair. The rest of the altar was clearly. visible,<br />\nhowever, and with the occasional aid of borrowed<br />\nbinoculars, our tip-toe view was probably better than<br />\naverage.<br />\nWhen the motorcade finally came, there was no<br />\npicnic, any commercialism, any media blitz.<br />\nany<br />\nlonger<br />\nThere was only The Mass. Non-Catholics can only<br />\nwonder at the significance to Catholics of this worship<br />\nservice, which has been the pivotal point of the Church<br />\nin the two millennia of its existence. The great changes<br />\nin modern Catholicism have been concerned mainly with<br />\nthe celibration of the Mass, and there is still heated<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University cordially invites you to attend<br />\n<br />\nYlehate<br />\n<br />\nargument over such issues as the role of women and the<br />\nuse of Latin in the service. Some of this disagreement<br />\ncame to the fore during the Pope's visit in America, but<br />\nit was not evidenced on the Mall.<br />\nCatholics participated in the Mass as naturally as<br />\nif they were back home, offering the \"Sign of Peace\" to<br />\ntotal strangers and long-time friends alike. A nun in<br />\nher seventies was standing next to me, and her barely<br />\nfive foot frame obviously afforded her no view at all of<br />\nthe Pope. Any attempt to improve her line of vision,<br />\nhowever, was sharply rejected. She apparently considered participation in this papal Mass the important thing,<br />\nand getting a good look at the Pope only secondary.<br />\nWhile most at the Mass, unlike this nun, were primarily<br />\ninterested in seeing John Paul, there was a definite<br />\natmosphere of participation.<br />\nWhen the Pope's homily began, however, ritual<br />\nparticipation quickly gave way to the exuberant applause of a political rally. Here was a new breed of<br />\npope; a man who was taking his cause to the people; a<br />\nleader who was not afraid of reaffirming unpopular<br />\nstands. Whatever these 175,000 believed,s they warmly<br />\napplauded the man who stood up on that altar and<br />\ndefended the Church's hardline position on abortion,<br />\ncontraception and divorce.<br />\nHaving started late, the Mass showed no signs of<br />\nending before the Pope Special was due to pull out of<br />\nUnion Station. The Liturgy of the Eucharist, which is<br />\nthe climax of the Mass, had only begun when we deemed<br />\nit necessary to start back. Anticipating the early departures, one priest had set himself up dispensing the communion host (an unleavened wafer) on the eastern edge<br />\nof the crowd, on the route back to the station and the<br />\nvarious Baltimore MTA buses. We therefore received<br />\ncommunion, but unfortunately did miss the papal<br />\nblessing at the end of the service.<br />\nThe tiip back to Baltimore was full of reflections<br />\non the Mass, especially on the Pope's homily. Most<br />\npeople continued to praise the speech. How much of<br />\nthis approval was for the actual principles he espoused,<br />\nand how much was for the man himself is difficult to<br />\ndetermine. American Catholics have lately tended to<br />\nignore the-See of Rome on many points where conflict<br />\narises. It is clear that John Paul made this trip to<br />\nAmerica primarily to reverse this tendency. Regardless<br />\nof whether or not the drift away from the Church's<br />\nconservative teachings has been checked, however, the<br />\nprestige of the papacy, which embodies these teachings,<br />\nhas been immeasurably heightened by the visit of this<br />\nman who hugs small children and admonishes presidents<br />\nwith the gregarious charm.<br />\n<br />\n011*<br />\n2nd<br />\nYEAR<br />\n<br />\nTHE LESTER S.

Current<br />\ndirector Richard H. Randall, Jr. claims in<br />\na recent brochure that \"few people, or<br />\nperhaps none, understood that Walters<br />\nhad set out in middle life to form not a<br />\ngreat collection, but a great museum,\" a<br />\nteaching thuseum that would include art<br />\nand artisanry from all times and places of<br />\nworld civilization. Yet the defensiveness<br />\nremains; even now, Walters \"has not<br />\nproperly taken his place among the great<br />\nAmerican collectors\" like Frick, Freer,<br />\nMorgan and Gardner.<br />\n'But despite Randall's claims, the<br />\nWalters has remained and probably<br />\nwill remain a museum without great<br />\ncritical importance. Nevertheless, the<br />\nWalters possesses a unique horde of<br />\nprecious treasure -- Barye bronzes,<br />\nJapanese netsuke, and medieval ivories.<br />\nThe Walters' current exhibit, \"Jewelry,<br />\nAncient to Modern\" takes full advantage<br />\nof its founder's unconventional style of<br />\ncollecting. Including pieces from protoliterate Sumer, Pharoanic Egypt, mysterious Etruria, classical and colonial Greece<br />\nand Rome, iconistic Byzantium, Europe<br />\nfrom the Middle Ages to the twentieth<br />\n<br />\nOn The Yard<br />\n<br />\ncentury, and turn of the century America, the show runs the gamut of jewelry<br />\nhistory and, by its varying levels of<br />\nindividual quality, preserves Walters'<br />\nintention - that of offering to the public<br />\nnot masterpieces, but \"a great universal<br />\ncollection\" for enjoyment and. scholarly<br />\nreference. The exhibit catalogue, published in conjunction with Viking Press,<br />\nwould certainly have pleased Henry<br />\nWalters. Its color plates are nothing short<br />\nof exquisite, and its detailed descriptions<br />\nand history,pf each object, supplemented<br />\nwith a bibliography and crossreferencing,<br />\nmake this volume a valuable research<br />\ntool.<br />\nOf the collections, divided chronologically, the Olbia Treasure, the M e di,eval Jewelry, and the Jewelry from the<br />\nEighteenth to the Early Twentieth<br />\nCentury are the most impressive. The<br />\nOlbia Treasure, whose stone-studded<br />\nnecklace has apparently been chosen as<br />\nthe trademark of the entire show, was<br />\nexcavated by Russian peasants digging a<br />\n<br />\nplot of land near the Crimea, probably in<br />\n1891. Due to sketchy wheelings and<br />\ndealings in the turn of the century art<br />\nworld, it is unclear whether Henry<br />\nWalters purchased the ancient Greek<br />\ntreasure that was unearthed along with<br />\nthe more prestigious 1891 find or the one<br />\ntwo decades later. Though this distinction might matter to an art historian, it<br />\ndoes not dim the viewer's delight. The<br />\nexcellence of the craftsmanship and<br />\nsubtle elegance of the semi-precious<br />\nstones allow this collection to crown the<br />\nPxhibit.<br />\nThe Medieval and Renaissance<br />\nJewelry collections, like the Walters'<br />\ncollections of other art objects of the<br />\nsame period, show strength and diversity<br />\nin their finely wrought craftsmanship.<br />\nThe catalogue really does not do justice<br />\nto the wealth of pocket-sized jeweled<br />\nmedallions, pendants, and tryptychs on<br />\ndisplay-smooth, painted cameos of the<br />\nMadonna, the Crucifixion, and the Last<br />\nJudgement; an enameled gold and jeweled<br />\n<br />\nA IR ir<br />\n<br />\nThe lay-out of the exhibit<br />\nmatched those of previous Waiters' shows,<br />\nif it did not exceed diem. The Walters,<br />\nwhich specializes in large collections of<br />\nsmall objects, knows the value of postersize enlargements of tiny scarab rings and<br />\nmirrors that reveal the hidden underside<br />\nof a finely carved ivory box. The exhibit<br />\nalso features paintings and photographs<br />\nof men and women from different eras<br />\njewels similar to the ones on<br />\nwearing<br />\ndisplay. One especially tawdry painting of<br />\nCleopatra at her toilette demonstrates<br />\nHenry Walters' foresight in buying art<br />\nwhich is mediocre but which serves an<br />\neducational purpose.<br />\nWednesday's gala opening night<br />\nglittered almost as much as the exhibit.<br />\nThe cream of Baltimore society gathered<br />\nin the Walters' grand courtyard to feast<br />\non strawberry crepes and white wine to<br />\nthe accompaniment of a Renaissance<br />\nbrass ensemble.

But to accuse these people<br />\nof vulgarity would be absurd-after<br />\nall, won't our descendants be oohing and<br />\nahing over these modern baubles thousands of years from now?<br />\n<br />\nOn The Inside Looking In<br />\nBY LISA KAY PEASE<br />\nAlthough On the Yard is billed as<br />\n\"the story of a unique prison struggle<br />\nand escape,\" the tenor of the film is more<br />\naccurately described by its creator,<br />\nMalcolm Braly, Baltimore writer and<br />\nveteran of 17 years in U.S. jails and<br />\nprisons: \"The book was written in San<br />\nQuentin Prison, on the presumption that<br />\nlife in San Quentin wasn't that different<br />\nfrom life outside.\"<br />\nMuch of the predictable claustrophobia and undiluted teniion of the<br />\nprison film is present here, but the<br />\nrestless movement of the camera and the<br />\nnarrative between the prison cells and the<br />\nexercise yard prevents the difficult<br />\nemotions evoked from overwhelming us.<br />\nThe yard itself -- mostly dust, wind, and<br />\nbleachers -- often serves as the stage on<br />\nwhich the indoor threats of muttered<br />\nexchanges and deliberate jostlings are<br />\nrealized. The yard is somewhere between<br />\nthe prison and the outside world; it is as<br />\nclose as any of the prisoners can get to<br />\n<br />\nfreedom - perhaps to self-expression and the guards' injunction, \"Lock up,<br />\nlock up,\" at the end of each period in the<br />\nyard exposes the irony of this strange<br />\nsuspension.<br />\nThe strength of the film stems<br />\nfrom this uneasiness. The audience's<br />\nintroduction to prison life (which parallels that of a group of new prisoners who<br />\narrive at the prison in the opening scenes)<br />\nthrough the ritualistic lingo and statusdetermined behavior of those already \"on<br />\nthe yard\" risks being cliche; but the film<br />\nalleviates its initial awkwardness by<br />\nforcing the expression of tension into<br />\nscenes constructed as scrupulously 'as<br />\npenitentiary walls. Much of the action on<br />\nthe yard is set up by the relentless bookkeeper and \"store\" runner, Chilly<br />\n(Thomas Waites), who sells cigarettes in<br />\nexchange for cash or favors. \"I've been in<br />\nand out of prisons since I was fourteen,\"<br />\nChilly says, \"and I've always been number one. And what has it got me? A<br />\ncrapper with a lid and a hot-water line!\"<br />\nIndividuals are bitter, but collec-<br />\n<br />\ntive strength is the source of all that<br />\nis positive on the yard. By \"positive,\" I<br />\ndo not mean an activity which is \"hopeful\" or even \"human,\" but one which is<br />\nnot determined by the physical limits and<br />\nspecific laws of incarceration. The group<br />\nhas enormous power; that the individual<br />\nbecomes significant -- even expressive -only when multiplied, could not be<br />\nargued more effectively than it is in this<br />\nfilm. Continually, we witness action<br />\nthrough crowd reaction -- from fights on<br />\nthe yard, to recreational boxing matches,<br />\nto the defiance of prison authority -- the<br />\noutcome of each being reflected in many<br />\nfaces and many voices. Against this<br />\nlandscape, the totalitarian authority of<br />\nthe con-man Chilly emerges as a dangerous assertion of pride; but again, we must<br />\nremember that for all his control, this<br />\nman is himself controlled and unlike the<br />\npolicemen in the*nitiwAll world, the<br />\nprison officials can -exercise their will far<br />\nmore easily: they can decide whether to<br />\ndestroy or protect him.<br />\nOn the Yard, filmed at the Rock-<br />\n<br />\nLisa Kay Pease'<br />\n<br />\nview State Prison in Pennsylvania, is being<br />\nshown as a benefit for Offender Aid and<br />\nRestoration of Baltimore, a national,<br />\nprivate, non-profit program which organizes citizen volunteers to aid prison<br />\ninmates before trial, during imprisonment<br />\nand after release. The film is not propagandistic, however. Although its honesty<br />\nis unflinching, and its tension unwavering,<br />\nthere is little 'sensationalism: violence is<br />\nnot expressed as \"shock value\" but as<br />\nthe logical intersection of various narrative threads. The film does not really tell<br />\nus anything new about prison life, nor<br />\ndoes this particular narrative resolve itself<br />\nor any of the problems it examines<br />\nin any conclusive manner; but I do not<br />\nthink the film proposes to do these<br />\nthings, nor do I think either is possible.<br />\nNevertheless, On the Yard is a clear-eyed,<br />\nthoroughly<br />\nand<br />\ntightly-structured<br />\nal The Yard will<br />\nknowledgeable film.<br />\nbe shown at The Charles on Oct. 18.<br />\n<br />\n\fWaters On The Brain<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 15<br />\nmoment of this film.

Residing within this<br />\nheap of aluminum we find an interesting<br />\narray of characters: Edie, a 4'8\", 250 lb.<br />\ngrandmother who is emotionally disturbed, eat\u00a7 only eggs, dozens per day, and<br />\nthinks she's living in a Club Car on<br />\nAmtrak; Crackers, a juvenile delinquent<br />\nwho makes love to his date with a live<br />\nrooster between them;iCotton , a social<br />\nsecretary who will let no manitouch her,<br />\nyet is an obsessive voyeur; and the great<br />\nDivine, alias Babs Johnson, a 300 lb.<br />\ntransvestite with a thirst for cold saliva<br />\nand hot meat.<br />\nThis is no hallucination. What we<br />\nhave before us, for our viewing pleasure<br />\nthis weekend, is one of the most outrageous cult films ever to be ejaculated<br />\nonto the Silver Bedsheet--John Waters'<br />\nPink Flamingos, a mean-thrusting look<br />\ninto the abode of man's deepest desires:<br />\nthe bathroom.<br />\nUnlike your ordinary X-movie,<br />\nFlamingos shies away from skin porn,<br />\nusing most of its energy to depict only<br />\nthe most sincere violations of the human<br />\nand animal body; and it is evident that<br />\nthe director concentrates more on comedy than he does on being grotesque.<br />\nIndeed, the very act of witnessing Connie<br />\nand Raymond Marble, the two emaciated<br />\nvillains, engage in a five-minute mutual<br />\nfoot fetish while exchanging declarations<br />\nof love, will surely cause anyone's hemorrhoids to bulge with delight. So overstated is the moral terror that only avid<br />\nchurchgoers could construe the film as<br />\noffensive.<br />\n<br />\nThe location of the film is familiar; in fact, it's quite close to home.<br />\nMany of the scenes were shot in the<br />\ngreater Baltimore area, and about a third<br />\nwithin close proximity of good ole'<br />\nJohnny Homewood. Waters evinces a<br />\nmarked disdain for the more affluent<br />\nBaltimore neighborhoods, in particular,<br />\nRoland Park and Guilford. Other recognizable places are Druid Hill Park, Charles<br />\nVillage and Fell's Point, which was the<br />\nneighborhood where Waters' production<br />\ncompany, Saliva Films, was based.<br />\nPink Flamingos, one of the most<br />\ncontroversial flicks of its time, has been<br />\nboth highly praised and flatly panned by<br />\nfilm critics from all over the world. This<br />\n<br />\nhas been generally exemplative of the<br />\npublic's reaction since the film's release<br />\nback in 1972. Either you love it or you<br />\nhate it. I most definitely put myself in<br />\nthe former group,having seen Flamingos<br />\nsix times. There is, however, much to<br />\ncriticize when speaking of Waters'<br />\ncinematographic technique, especially<br />\nwhen one discovers that the film was<br />\nproduced for a mere $12,000. Waters<br />\nused only one camera, a news camera at<br />\nthat, with one spotlight connected to a<br />\n'very long extension cord. The colors are<br />\nflat and faded, showing little, if any, use<br />\nof filters; also, the sound recording is<br />\nshoddy, causing the viewer to strain in<br />\norder to catch all of the lines. Camera<br />\nmovement is predictable: some tripod<br />\nshots, a significant number of hand-held<br />\nshots, and a few taken from the windows<br />\nof moving automobiles.<br />\nIti is, nonetheless, the writing and<br />\ncasting of 'the film which makes it a<br />\nmodern masterpiece. Though the story<br />\nitself may be fictional, the characters are<br />\nreal --Divine really is a transvestite and, if<br />\nyou've ever been to Edith's Shopping Bag<br />\nin Fell's Point, you know that she's not<br />\nso far removed from her role as the Egg<br />\nLady. These people aren't sitting in<br />\nBeverly Hills jacuzzis; they're right here<br />\naround us. In fact, there have been one or<br />\ntwo Hopkins students and professors used<br />\nin cameo shots over the years. Otherwise,<br />\nmost of the Flamingos stars have lived in<br />\nBaltimore all their lives. As a piece of<br />\nwriting, the film is straightforward, never<br />\nconfusing, and always holds the attention<br />\nof the audience. It presents continuous<br />\nvignettes of our mundane ideology and<br />\nthen defecates all over them.<br />\nAs you are numbed by one<br />\nshocking scene after another, you begin<br />\nto realize that these rejects of society do<br />\nexist in the population at large, and that<br />\nthey are in a sense, portraying for us<br />\nthose taboo thoughts which we are<br />\nconstantly repressing. Why else do we<br />\nlaugh hysterically when Babs Johnson<br />\nstuffs a raw steak up her dress to \"keep it<br />\nwarm in the oven\"? We would never do<br />\nthat kind of thing ourselves, would we?<br />\nInstead of escaping into fantasy,<br />\nwe are given that segment of reality about<br />\nwhich nobody wants to believe; and in<br />\nthat sense, it is fantasy. Pink Flamingos<br />\nshows us that we are all perverts of<br />\nvarying types and degrees: each of us has<br />\na little voyeur within who loves every<br />\n<br />\nFreshman<br />\nOne Acts<br />\nMixed Bag<br />\n<br />\nThe New Arnbaosia2<br />\nSIOecoalk Baccet<br />\n(in the Ratbskeilea)<br />\nCaaveo<br />\nMONDAY OCT 15<br />\nRoast Beef co/ aa Jas<br />\nCaaveo<br />\nTUESDAY,OCT16<br />\nRoast Beer w/Aa Jas<br />\n<br />\nINTERNATIONAL<br />\nCAREER?<br />\n<br />\nanO BBQ Ribs<br />\n<br />\nKr4<br />\n<br />\nWEDNESDAY,OCT 17<br />\n<br />\nCaaoecl<br />\nRoast Taakeg co/Gravy ono<br />\n<br />\n...\u2022.<br />\n<br />\nRoast Beer co/Aa Jas<br />\nTHURSDAY,OCT 18<br />\n<br />\nDeli Line<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nco/Pastaarni, Bakecl Ham<br />\nanO Corznees Beer<br />\nCaavec)<br />\nFRIDAY OCT 19<br />\nRoast Beef co/Au Jas ono<br />\nBake() Filet of HaMoock<br />\n<br />\nA representative<br />\nwill be on the campus<br />\nMONDAY<br />\nOCTOBER 22, 1979<br />\nto discuss qualifications for<br />\nadvanced study at<br />\nAMERICAN<br />\nGRADUATE SCHOOL<br />\nand job opportunities<br />\nin the field of<br />\nINTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT<br />\n<br />\nInterviews may be scheduled at<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n..<br />\n<br />\n....%<br />\n..v.Seaving Lunch 11-30 - 2-30 P.M.;<br />\n<br />\nPLACEMENT OFFICE<br />\nGarland Hall<br />\n<br />\nAMERICAN<br />\n<br />\nGRADUATE SCHOOL<br />\n<br />\nOF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT<br />\n<br />\nThunderbird Campus<br />\nGlendale, Arizona 85306<br />\n<br />\nBY WALTER HOOK<br />\nThe Barnstormers' Freshman One<br />\nActs, to be performed tonight and<br />\ntomorrow night in the Listening/Viewing<br />\nRoom, offers a well varied show,combinings musical numbers, absurdist theater,<br />\nhumor, and conventional drama.<br />\nOpening with \"Summer Lovin'\"<br />\nfrom Grease, the show kicks off to a<br />\nlively start.

The two British musicians are<br />\nformer members of Henry Cow as well as<br />\nthe (recently disbanded) Art Bears.<br />\nTogether they create some of the most<br />\nchallenging and tasteful improvisation to<br />\nbe heard anywhere.<br />\nFrith and Cutler are influenced by<br />\nthe serious experimental tradition as<br />\nmuch as by jazz and rock. The key to<br />\n<br />\ntheir method is an undisguised preoccupation with sounds rather than some<br />\nvague plan or definition of \"music.\"<br />\nThat, together, these sounds do yield<br />\nmusic<br />\ndemonstrates the<br />\ncohesive<br />\nmethod's validity. The musicians play a<br />\ngame in which they expose many sounds<br />\nand see what happens. Often relations<br />\nwill be allowed to exist between the<br />\nsounds as they would naturally between<br />\npeople in a social situation. Like these<br />\npersonal relationships, the unplanned<br />\nmusical connections grow more complex<br />\nthan any the musicians could have<br />\nimposed.<br />\nThe concert consisted of three<br />\nlong pieces and an encore that featured<br />\nFrith on violin. As in his solo appearance<br />\nat Hopkins last spring, Frith commanded<br />\nendless tonal variety, playing a speciallybuilt double-necked guitar, a regular<br />\nelectric guitar, and assorted whistles and<br />\nbells. \u2022 Cutler is a precision drummer who<br />\nentered the realm of experimentation<br />\nwith contact microphones and a homemade device to alter the surface tension<br />\non certain drums.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n- The music was playful and intuitively shaped, with several rhythms<br />\noperating or implied simultaneously.

According<br />\nto Flanagan, who threw 138<br />\npitches Wednesday evening, the<br />\nforty-degree frigidity didn't<br />\nbother him.

His<br />\nunsteady pitching, coupled with<br />\na timely error by second baseman Phil Garner, gave the<br />\nOrioles a 2-0 lead with two men<br />\non and only one out.

Dave<br />\n<br />\nParker led the Pirates in hits for<br />\nthe game, going 4-for-5 (tying<br />\nthe World Series record), and<br />\ntwo key Pirate runs were scored<br />\nin the sixth inning on two errors<br />\nby Oriole third baseman Doug<br />\nDeCinces.<br />\nWhile Stargell contributed<br />\n<br />\nonce again to the Pirates' nearcomeback Wednesday night, his<br />\nground-out to second in the<br />\nfourth inning drove in thr first<br />\nPittsburgh run, and his eighth<br />\ninning solo home run scored the<br />\nfourth and final Pirate run of the<br />\nevening.<br />\nThe Oriole who received the<br />\nnow-traditional post-game ovation was, quite justifiably, Mike<br />\nFlanagan.

It seems as if this issue has<br />\nbrought everyone out of the woodwork, from Reagan<br />\nsupporters to something entitled the Revolutionary<br />\nStudent Brigade. (Dixie Dick, a man well versed in military parlance, informs us that a brigade usually has about<br />\n5000 people in it. Wow! With membership like that you<br />\npeople can start your own school!) Now that the student<br />\nbody has been assaulted by polemics from the opposing<br />\ntrenches, a little moderation is in order., Also, since this<br />\nweek the News-Letter has been accused of being a mere<br />\npuppet of the \"Chet Set,\" it is time for us to state our<br />\nposition.<br />\nIt is very easy to say that politics and religion should<br />\nnot mix; that the Chaplain's Office should not soil its<br />\nsupposedly pious fingers by digging in the secular sandbox.<br />\nIt is well-nigh impossible, however, to put such a program<br />\ninto action. People, no matter what campus organization<br />\nthey work for, are bound to hold political opinions of one<br />\nsort or another. These opinions will inevitably4and perhaps unconciouslykolor the manner in which they go<br />\nabout their business. To ask the members of the Chaplain's Office to erase all political opinions from their minds<br />\nis to ask for too much. Conscience and religion, it is to be<br />\nhoped, will never become mutually exclusive in the minds<br />\nof those who claim spiritual authority, and when their<br />\nconscience is disturbed by secular events, we cannot<br />\nrightfully condemn them for acting as the rest of us do<br />\nunder similar circumstances.<br />\nA distinction must be made, however, between the<br />\nindividuals in the Chaplain's Office and the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice as an organization. As we stated above, the leanings<br />\nof the indiviauals must be expected to manifest themselves<br />\nin the policies, of the group to some extent. The trouble<br />\nwith the Cahplain's Office, however, is that this natural<br />\nproclivity has gotten completely out of hand.<br />\nThe Office claims that it will assist any program<br />\nwhich it feels will be of benefit to mankind, regardless of<br />\nthat program's position in the political spectrum. Oh<br />\nyeah? A few of us have been here over three years now,<br />\nand we haven't seen it yet. No matter what they claim,<br />\nthe Office has become synonymous with left-of-center<br />\npolitical groups. This we can rightfully condemn, and<br />\nrightfully demand that they change it. Politically conservative groups must begin approaching the Chaplain's<br />\nchallenge them to live up to their promise,<br />\nEntourage,<br />\nand to raise a lot of Hell if they don't. Actually, it is not<br />\nenough for the Office to sit back and wait for such groups<br />\nto approach them \u2014 rather, they must actively solicit their<br />\nparticipation. After all, the Office has allowed its image to<br />\ntarnish and the Office must do something to correct the<br />\nsituation.<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office represents the University as a<br />\nwhole \u2014 that means all the students, not just registered<br />\nDemocrats. \u2022The Office has become polarized and narrowminded; and hence a large group of students are simply not<br />\ngetting their money's worth. \"Equal-Time\" is not just an<br />\nempty phrase. What it should be is the guiding principle<br />\nof any organization which claims to represent Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWe are not saying that those who espouse left-wing<br />\npolitical -views are wrong. We are saying that when such<br />\npeople come to monopolize a University Office which<br />\neveryone pays for, then somebody is getting screwed. The<br />\nChaplain's Office must begin to make good on its claim -because unless God publicly endorses Teddy Kennedy<br />\npretty soon, its put up or shut up time.<br /><br />\ngroups certainly advocate preferential treatment, while the<br />\nKlan and the Nazis actually<br />\nadvocate dis-preferential treatment.

Gig A Hit<br />\nby Kevil Duhon<br /><br />\nThere were over 175,000 of us there -- American,<br />\nmostly younger Catholics come to see a' Polish pope say<br />\nmass on the Mall in Washington. Perhaps those older<br />\nthan I could remember the great demonstrations of the<br />\nSixties, which took place on that very spot. For me,the<br />\nclosest point of comparison was last Spring's anti-nuke<br />\nrally on the Capital grounds. Thers, about half as many<br />\npeople gathered for an almost light-hearted festival of<br />\nbig-name musicians and big-name speakers. While most<br />\nof the demonstrators had undoubtedly come to voice<br />\ntheir opposition to nuclear energy, one could not<br />\nunderestimate the drawing power of Jackson Browne,<br />\nJane Fonda,and a beautiful Spring afternoon. This Mass<br />\non the Mallswassmade of sterner stuff. Pope John Paul II<br />\nhad comesto do nothing less than shepherd his wayward<br />\nflock back to the fold of Roman Catholicism. Judging<br />\nfrom the reactions of the majority in Washington and all<br />\nalong the papal route, a stern, fatherly shepherd is<br />\nexactly what American Catholics want.<br />\nOur own Father Donahue, whose Catholic<br />\nCommunity on Campus supplied the largest group on<br />\nthe train (some 100 ticket-holders), found himself the<br />\nwitting victim of a News American interrogator and<br />\nphotographer. \"Cap\", as he is known to many on<br />\ncampus, managed to stage several shotss of C.C.O.C.<br />\nmembers, ands to get quoteds asfew times in the next<br />\nday's paper (under the alias of \"Rev. Donaghue\").<br />\nInstant celebrity came to that poor niche of the<br />\ntrain which was occupied by my companions and myself<br />\nwhen the previously mentioned reporter found a rare<br />\nempty seat (mine), and fell into it. Skip Landry and I<br />\nboth made it into his notebook, but were cut after<br />\nthat first step, apparently for comments too mundane.<br />\nI found myself bumming paper and pen off<br />\nwhomever I could -- an especially embarrassing task for a<br />\nyoung reporter tryingsto emulate the swarthy independence of Jack Andersonsor Ernest Hemingway. I thought<br />\nsure I had packed that note pad in the pack along<br />\nwith the sandwiches and raincoat.<br />\nAll this preoccupation with the press disappeared<br />\nas soon as we disembarked at Union Station in Washington. I left all notions of note-taking, as well as any<br />\npresumed intellectual disinterestedness in the coming<br />\nproceedings on the train for safe-keeping. This pilgrim<br />\ncovered those seven blocks to the Mali as fast as any of<br />\nmy fellows, and faster than some.<br />\nArriving at noon for a Mass that was not to begin<br />\nuntil 4:00, we looked for ways to pass the time. At<br />\nfirst, intent on getting a good look at the Pope, we<br />\nfought our way into the dense core of the people<br /><br />\nthronged directly m front of the altar. Conditions there<br />\nwere tight, to say the least. Closed in by the crowd, we<br />\nwere soon immobilized. Luckily, we were able to jump<br />\ninto the wake of a lady with a baby carriage, for whom<br />\nthe crowd opened up. A tetreat -to the fringe brought an<br />\nopportunity to eat our picnic lunch,listen to folk music<br />\ncoming falteringly over the public address system, and<br />\nobserve the crowd.<br />\nPope buttons, pictures, caps, flags, T-shirts,<br />\ncalendars, etx. rapidly changed hands at high prices early<br />\nin the afternoon, but as the weather began to dampen<br />\nthe turn-out, prices fell at a proportionate rate. While<br />\nmany were disgusted by the commercialization, there<br />\nwas also the strong desire for souvenoirs of this momentous occasion. When the price fell to two large buttons<br />\nfor a dollar, even this cub reporter found it altogether<br />\ntoo tempting. Popular button slogans included: \"John<br />\nPau! II, I love you,\" \"Kiss me, I'm Polish,\" and certain<br />\nPolish inscriptions which I could not fathom.<br />\nProbably the strangest slogan on the Mall Sunday<br />\nwas displayed on the banner brought by Hopkins.<br />\nWritten in New Testament Greek characters, the message<br />\nmeant, \"Hearty Greetings in the Lord.\" Two hearty<br />\nstandard-bearers chased after the TV crews, essaying to<br />\nhave their unusual sign recorded for posterity as a part<br />\nof this unusual Mass.<br />\nAt 3:00, when the Pope was supposed to start<br />\nthe Mass, the sun broke through the clouds and received<br />\na brief applause from the onlookers below. ,Something<br />\nfrom my Catholic heritage stirred in me to think that<br />\nthe clouds would dissipate and light shine through with<br />\nthe arrival of the Pope, but such romantisism was soon<br />\ndispelled.<br />\nBy this time, the hoopla which accompanies any<br />\nlarge gathering in this country had given way to a certain<br />\nanxiety in the crowd. Skip and I, separated from our<br />\nco-picnicers, began jockeying for a better position. We<br />\nsettled on a spot directly opposite the altar, on the other<br />\nside of the Mall. A tree stood directly between us and<br />\nthe papal chair. The rest of the altar was clearly. visible,<br />\nhowever, and with the occasional aid of borrowed<br />\nbinoculars, our tip-toe view was probably better than<br />\naverage.<br />\nWhen the motorcade finally came, there was no<br />\npicnic, any commercialism, any media blitz.<br />\nany<br />\nlonger<br />\nThere was only The Mass. Non-Catholics can only<br />\nwonder at the significance to Catholics of this worship<br />\nservice, which has been the pivotal point of the Church<br />\nin the two millennia of its existence. The great changes<br />\nin modern Catholicism have been concerned mainly with<br />\nthe celibration of the Mass, and there is still heated<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University cordially invites you to attend<br /><br />\nYlehate<br /><br />\nargument over such issues as the role of women and the<br />\nuse of Latin in the service. Some of this disagreement<br />\ncame to the fore during the Pope's visit in America, but<br />\nit was not evidenced on the Mall.<br />\nCatholics participated in the Mass as naturally as<br />\nif they were back home, offering the \"Sign of Peace\" to<br />\ntotal strangers and long-time friends alike. A nun in<br />\nher seventies was standing next to me, and her barely<br />\nfive foot frame obviously afforded her no view at all of<br />\nthe Pope. Any attempt to improve her line of vision,<br />\nhowever, was sharply rejected. She apparently considered participation in this papal Mass the important thing,<br />\nand getting a good look at the Pope only secondary.<br />\nWhile most at the Mass, unlike this nun, were primarily<br />\ninterested in seeing John Paul, there was a definite<br />\natmosphere of participation.<br />\nWhen the Pope's homily began, however, ritual<br />\nparticipation quickly gave way to the exuberant applause of a political rally. Here was a new breed of<br />\npope; a man who was taking his cause to the people; a<br />\nleader who was not afraid of reaffirming unpopular<br />\nstands. Whatever these 175,000 believed,s they warmly<br />\napplauded the man who stood up on that altar and<br />\ndefended the Church's hardline position on abortion,<br />\ncontraception and divorce.<br />\nHaving started late, the Mass showed no signs of<br />\nending before the Pope Special was due to pull out of<br />\nUnion Station. The Liturgy of the Eucharist, which is<br />\nthe climax of the Mass, had only begun when we deemed<br />\nit necessary to start back. Anticipating the early departures, one priest had set himself up dispensing the communion host (an unleavened wafer) on the eastern edge<br />\nof the crowd, on the route back to the station and the<br />\nvarious Baltimore MTA buses. We therefore received<br />\ncommunion, but unfortunately did miss the papal<br />\nblessing at the end of the service.<br />\nThe tiip back to Baltimore was full of reflections<br />\non the Mass, especially on the Pope's homily. Most<br />\npeople continued to praise the speech. How much of<br />\nthis approval was for the actual principles he espoused,<br />\nand how much was for the man himself is difficult to<br />\ndetermine. American Catholics have lately tended to<br />\nignore the-See of Rome on many points where conflict<br />\narises. It is clear that John Paul made this trip to<br />\nAmerica primarily to reverse this tendency. Regardless<br />\nof whether or not the drift away from the Church's<br />\nconservative teachings has been checked, however, the<br />\nprestige of the papacy, which embodies these teachings,<br />\nhas been immeasurably heightened by the visit of this<br />\nman who hugs small children and admonishes presidents<br />\nwith the gregarious charm.<br /><br />\n011*<br />\n2nd<br />\nYEAR<br /><br />\nTHE LESTER S.

Current<br />\ndirector Richard H. Randall, Jr. claims in<br />\na recent brochure that \"few people, or<br />\nperhaps none, understood that Walters<br />\nhad set out in middle life to form not a<br />\ngreat collection, but a great museum,\" a<br />\nteaching thuseum that would include art<br />\nand artisanry from all times and places of<br />\nworld civilization. Yet the defensiveness<br />\nremains; even now, Walters \"has not<br />\nproperly taken his place among the great<br />\nAmerican collectors\" like Frick, Freer,<br />\nMorgan and Gardner.<br />\n'But despite Randall's claims, the<br />\nWalters has remained and probably<br />\nwill remain a museum without great<br />\ncritical importance. Nevertheless, the<br />\nWalters possesses a unique horde of<br />\nprecious treasure -- Barye bronzes,<br />\nJapanese netsuke, and medieval ivories.<br />\nThe Walters' current exhibit, \"Jewelry,<br />\nAncient to Modern\" takes full advantage<br />\nof its founder's unconventional style of<br />\ncollecting. Including pieces from protoliterate Sumer, Pharoanic Egypt, mysterious Etruria, classical and colonial Greece<br />\nand Rome, iconistic Byzantium, Europe<br />\nfrom the Middle Ages to the twentieth<br /><br />\nOn The Yard<br /><br />\ncentury, and turn of the century America, the show runs the gamut of jewelry<br />\nhistory and, by its varying levels of<br />\nindividual quality, preserves Walters'<br />\nintention - that of offering to the public<br />\nnot masterpieces, but \"a great universal<br />\ncollection\" for enjoyment and. scholarly<br />\nreference. The exhibit catalogue, published in conjunction with Viking Press,<br />\nwould certainly have pleased Henry<br />\nWalters. Its color plates are nothing short<br />\nof exquisite, and its detailed descriptions<br />\nand history,pf each object, supplemented<br />\nwith a bibliography and crossreferencing,<br />\nmake this volume a valuable research<br />\ntool.<br />\nOf the collections, divided chronologically, the Olbia Treasure, the M e di,eval Jewelry, and the Jewelry from the<br />\nEighteenth to the Early Twentieth<br />\nCentury are the most impressive. The<br />\nOlbia Treasure, whose stone-studded<br />\nnecklace has apparently been chosen as<br />\nthe trademark of the entire show, was<br />\nexcavated by Russian peasants digging a<br /><br />\nplot of land near the Crimea, probably in<br />\n1891. Due to sketchy wheelings and<br />\ndealings in the turn of the century art<br />\nworld, it is unclear whether Henry<br />\nWalters purchased the ancient Greek<br />\ntreasure that was unearthed along with<br />\nthe more prestigious 1891 find or the one<br />\ntwo decades later. Though this distinction might matter to an art historian, it<br />\ndoes not dim the viewer's delight. The<br />\nexcellence of the craftsmanship and<br />\nsubtle elegance of the semi-precious<br />\nstones allow this collection to crown the<br />\nPxhibit.<br />\nThe Medieval and Renaissance<br />\nJewelry collections, like the Walters'<br />\ncollections of other art objects of the<br />\nsame period, show strength and diversity<br />\nin their finely wrought craftsmanship.<br />\nThe catalogue really does not do justice<br />\nto the wealth of pocket-sized jeweled<br />\nmedallions, pendants, and tryptychs on<br />\ndisplay-smooth, painted cameos of the<br />\nMadonna, the Crucifixion, and the Last<br />\nJudgement; an enameled gold and jeweled<br /><br />\nA IR ir<br /><br />\nThe lay-out of the exhibit<br />\nmatched those of previous Waiters' shows,<br />\nif it did not exceed diem. The Walters,<br />\nwhich specializes in large collections of<br />\nsmall objects, knows the value of postersize enlargements of tiny scarab rings and<br />\nmirrors that reveal the hidden underside<br />\nof a finely carved ivory box. The exhibit<br />\nalso features paintings and photographs<br />\nof men and women from different eras<br />\njewels similar to the ones on<br />\nwearing<br />\ndisplay. One especially tawdry painting of<br />\nCleopatra at her toilette demonstrates<br />\nHenry Walters' foresight in buying art<br />\nwhich is mediocre but which serves an<br />\neducational purpose.<br />\nWednesday's gala opening night<br />\nglittered almost as much as the exhibit.<br />\nThe cream of Baltimore society gathered<br />\nin the Walters' grand courtyard to feast<br />\non strawberry crepes and white wine to<br />\nthe accompaniment of a Renaissance<br />\nbrass ensemble.

But to accuse these people<br />\nof vulgarity would be absurd-after<br />\nall, won't our descendants be oohing and<br />\nahing over these modern baubles thousands of years from now?<br /><br />\nOn The Inside Looking In<br />\nBY LISA KAY PEASE<br />\nAlthough On the Yard is billed as<br />\n\"the story of a unique prison struggle<br />\nand escape,\" the tenor of the film is more<br />\naccurately described by its creator,<br />\nMalcolm Braly, Baltimore writer and<br />\nveteran of 17 years in U.S. jails and<br />\nprisons: \"The book was written in San<br />\nQuentin Prison, on the presumption that<br />\nlife in San Quentin wasn't that different<br />\nfrom life outside.\"<br />\nMuch of the predictable claustrophobia and undiluted teniion of the<br />\nprison film is present here, but the<br />\nrestless movement of the camera and the<br />\nnarrative between the prison cells and the<br />\nexercise yard prevents the difficult<br />\nemotions evoked from overwhelming us.<br />\nThe yard itself -- mostly dust, wind, and<br />\nbleachers -- often serves as the stage on<br />\nwhich the indoor threats of muttered<br />\nexchanges and deliberate jostlings are<br />\nrealized. The yard is somewhere between<br />\nthe prison and the outside world; it is as<br />\nclose as any of the prisoners can get to<br /><br />\nfreedom - perhaps to self-expression and the guards' injunction, \"Lock up,<br />\nlock up,\" at the end of each period in the<br />\nyard exposes the irony of this strange<br />\nsuspension.<br />\nThe strength of the film stems<br />\nfrom this uneasiness. The audience's<br />\nintroduction to prison life (which parallels that of a group of new prisoners who<br />\narrive at the prison in the opening scenes)<br />\nthrough the ritualistic lingo and statusdetermined behavior of those already \"on<br />\nthe yard\" risks being cliche; but the film<br />\nalleviates its initial awkwardness by<br />\nforcing the expression of tension into<br />\nscenes constructed as scrupulously 'as<br />\npenitentiary walls. Much of the action on<br />\nthe yard is set up by the relentless bookkeeper and \"store\" runner, Chilly<br />\n(Thomas Waites), who sells cigarettes in<br />\nexchange for cash or favors. \"I've been in<br />\nand out of prisons since I was fourteen,\"<br />\nChilly says, \"and I've always been number one. And what has it got me? A<br />\ncrapper with a lid and a hot-water line!\"<br />\nIndividuals are bitter, but collec-<br /><br />\ntive strength is the source of all that<br />\nis positive on the yard. By \"positive,\" I<br />\ndo not mean an activity which is \"hopeful\" or even \"human,\" but one which is<br />\nnot determined by the physical limits and<br />\nspecific laws of incarceration. The group<br />\nhas enormous power; that the individual<br />\nbecomes significant -- even expressive -only when multiplied, could not be<br />\nargued more effectively than it is in this<br />\nfilm. Continually, we witness action<br />\nthrough crowd reaction -- from fights on<br />\nthe yard, to recreational boxing matches,<br />\nto the defiance of prison authority -- the<br />\noutcome of each being reflected in many<br />\nfaces and many voices. Against this<br />\nlandscape, the totalitarian authority of<br />\nthe con-man Chilly emerges as a dangerous assertion of pride; but again, we must<br />\nremember that for all his control, this<br />\nman is himself controlled and unlike the<br />\npolicemen in the*nitiwAll world, the<br />\nprison officials can -exercise their will far<br />\nmore easily: they can decide whether to<br />\ndestroy or protect him.<br />\nOn the Yard, filmed at the Rock-<br /><br />\nLisa Kay Pease'<br /><br />\nview State Prison in Pennsylvania, is being<br />\nshown as a benefit for Offender Aid and<br />\nRestoration of Baltimore, a national,<br />\nprivate, non-profit program which organizes citizen volunteers to aid prison<br />\ninmates before trial, during imprisonment<br />\nand after release. The film is not propagandistic, however. Although its honesty<br />\nis unflinching, and its tension unwavering,<br />\nthere is little 'sensationalism: violence is<br />\nnot expressed as \"shock value\" but as<br />\nthe logical intersection of various narrative threads. The film does not really tell<br />\nus anything new about prison life, nor<br />\ndoes this particular narrative resolve itself<br />\nor any of the problems it examines<br />\nin any conclusive manner; but I do not<br />\nthink the film proposes to do these<br />\nthings, nor do I think either is possible.<br />\nNevertheless, On the Yard is a clear-eyed,<br />\nthoroughly<br />\nand<br />\ntightly-structured<br />\nal The Yard will<br />\nknowledgeable film.<br />\nbe shown at The Charles on Oct. 18.<br /><br />\nWaters On The Brain<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 15<br />\nmoment of this film.

Residing within this<br />\nheap of aluminum we find an interesting<br />\narray of characters: Edie, a 4'8\", 250 lb.<br />\ngrandmother who is emotionally disturbed, eat\u00a7 only eggs, dozens per day, and<br />\nthinks she's living in a Club Car on<br />\nAmtrak; Crackers, a juvenile delinquent<br />\nwho makes love to his date with a live<br />\nrooster between them;iCotton , a social<br />\nsecretary who will let no manitouch her,<br />\nyet is an obsessive voyeur; and the great<br />\nDivine, alias Babs Johnson, a 300 lb.<br />\ntransvestite with a thirst for cold saliva<br />\nand hot meat.<br />\nThis is no hallucination. What we<br />\nhave before us, for our viewing pleasure<br />\nthis weekend, is one of the most outrageous cult films ever to be ejaculated<br />\nonto the Silver Bedsheet--John Waters'<br />\nPink Flamingos, a mean-thrusting look<br />\ninto the abode of man's deepest desires:<br />\nthe bathroom.<br />\nUnlike your ordinary X-movie,<br />\nFlamingos shies away from skin porn,<br />\nusing most of its energy to depict only<br />\nthe most sincere violations of the human<br />\nand animal body; and it is evident that<br />\nthe director concentrates more on comedy than he does on being grotesque.<br />\nIndeed, the very act of witnessing Connie<br />\nand Raymond Marble, the two emaciated<br />\nvillains, engage in a five-minute mutual<br />\nfoot fetish while exchanging declarations<br />\nof love, will surely cause anyone's hemorrhoids to bulge with delight. So overstated is the moral terror that only avid<br />\nchurchgoers could construe the film as<br />\noffensive.<br /><br />\nThe location of the film is familiar; in fact, it's quite close to home.<br />\nMany of the scenes were shot in the<br />\ngreater Baltimore area, and about a third<br />\nwithin close proximity of good ole'<br />\nJohnny Homewood. Waters evinces a<br />\nmarked disdain for the more affluent<br />\nBaltimore neighborhoods, in particular,<br />\nRoland Park and Guilford. Other recognizable places are Druid Hill Park, Charles<br />\nVillage and Fell's Point, which was the<br />\nneighborhood where Waters' production<br />\ncompany, Saliva Films, was based.<br />\nPink Flamingos, one of the most<br />\ncontroversial flicks of its time, has been<br />\nboth highly praised and flatly panned by<br />\nfilm critics from all over the world. This<br /><br />\nhas been generally exemplative of the<br />\npublic's reaction since the film's release<br />\nback in 1972. Either you love it or you<br />\nhate it. I most definitely put myself in<br />\nthe former group,having seen Flamingos<br />\nsix times. There is, however, much to<br />\ncriticize when speaking of Waters'<br />\ncinematographic technique, especially<br />\nwhen one discovers that the film was<br />\nproduced for a mere $12,000. Waters<br />\nused only one camera, a news camera at<br />\nthat, with one spotlight connected to a<br />\n'very long extension cord. The colors are<br />\nflat and faded, showing little, if any, use<br />\nof filters; also, the sound recording is<br />\nshoddy, causing the viewer to strain in<br />\norder to catch all of the lines. Camera<br />\nmovement is predictable: some tripod<br />\nshots, a significant number of hand-held<br />\nshots, and a few taken from the windows<br />\nof moving automobiles.<br />\nIti is, nonetheless, the writing and<br />\ncasting of 'the film which makes it a<br />\nmodern masterpiece. Though the story<br />\nitself may be fictional, the characters are<br />\nreal --Divine really is a transvestite and, if<br />\nyou've ever been to Edith's Shopping Bag<br />\nin Fell's Point, you know that she's not<br />\nso far removed from her role as the Egg<br />\nLady. These people aren't sitting in<br />\nBeverly Hills jacuzzis; they're right here<br />\naround us. In fact, there have been one or<br />\ntwo Hopkins students and professors used<br />\nin cameo shots over the years. Otherwise,<br />\nmost of the Flamingos stars have lived in<br />\nBaltimore all their lives. As a piece of<br />\nwriting, the film is straightforward, never<br />\nconfusing, and always holds the attention<br />\nof the audience. It presents continuous<br />\nvignettes of our mundane ideology and<br />\nthen defecates all over them.<br />\nAs you are numbed by one<br />\nshocking scene after another, you begin<br />\nto realize that these rejects of society do<br />\nexist in the population at large, and that<br />\nthey are in a sense, portraying for us<br />\nthose taboo thoughts which we are<br />\nconstantly repressing. Why else do we<br />\nlaugh hysterically when Babs Johnson<br />\nstuffs a raw steak up her dress to \"keep it<br />\nwarm in the oven\"? We would never do<br />\nthat kind of thing ourselves, would we?<br />\nInstead of escaping into fantasy,<br />\nwe are given that segment of reality about<br />\nwhich nobody wants to believe; and in<br />\nthat sense, it is fantasy.

The two British musicians are<br />\nformer members of Henry Cow as well as<br />\nthe (recently disbanded) Art Bears.<br />\nTogether they create some of the most<br />\nchallenging and tasteful improvisation to<br />\nbe heard anywhere.<br />\nFrith and Cutler are influenced by<br />\nthe serious experimental tradition as<br />\nmuch as by jazz and rock. The key to<br /><br />\ntheir method is an undisguised preoccupation with sounds rather than some<br />\nvague plan or definition of \"music.\"<br />\nThat, together, these sounds do yield<br />\nmusic<br />\ndemonstrates the<br />\ncohesive<br />\nmethod's validity. The musicians play a<br />\ngame in which they expose many sounds<br />\nand see what happens. Often relations<br />\nwill be allowed to exist between the<br />\nsounds as they would naturally between<br />\npeople in a social situation. Like these<br />\npersonal relationships, the unplanned<br />\nmusical connections grow more complex<br />\nthan any the musicians could have<br />\nimposed.<br />\nThe concert consisted of three<br />\nlong pieces and an encore that featured<br />\nFrith on violin. As in his solo appearance<br />\nat Hopkins last spring, Frith commanded<br />\nendless tonal variety, playing a speciallybuilt double-necked guitar, a regular<br />\nelectric guitar, and assorted whistles and<br />\nbells. \u2022 Cutler is a precision drummer who<br />\nentered the realm of experimentation<br />\nwith contact microphones and a homemade device to alter the surface tension<br />\non certain drums.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n- The music was playful and intuitively shaped, with several rhythms<br />\noperating or implied simultaneously. The<br />\nsound spread out in layers that diminished as other themes were introduced,<br />\nleaving tension behind. It was impossible<br />\nto pick out a pattern from the multiplicity and follow its development; rather,<br />\none could perceive a musical gestalt.<br />\nFrith and Cutler never abandoned their<br />\nimprovisational concept:<br />\nthey might<br />\nintroduce parts of tunes, progressions,<br />\nrepetitive phrases or ostinatos, but these<br />\nwere elegantly juxtaposed or mixed<br />\nwith abstract sound .<br />\nThe music was the aural equivalent of a Tanguey painting --somewhere<br />\nbetween abstract and surrealism.
