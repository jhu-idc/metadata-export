We know that the endless<br />\nviolence barraging us through the media has<br />\nleft us unable to react with anything more<br />\nthan a shrug at each new killing.<br />\nYet there is an aspect of this jaded<br />\nattitude, of this having seen the most<br />\nhorrible twists that one could reasonably<br />\nexpect to see, that makes us perhaps better<br />\njudges of a truly catastrophic event when it<br />\ncomes along. Part of the reason that we<br />\nhave been reduced to shrugging at assassinations is that, in a tangible way, they have<br />\nhad no real effect on our daily lives. While<br />\none could write volumes about how different this country would be today if the<br />\nKennedys and Martin Luther King had<br />\nlived, there was little perceptible change for<br />\nmost people directly after those men were<br />\ngone. No state of martial law was declared,<br />\nthere was no revolution in the streets, and<br />\nthere was still food on the table.<br />\nThat may be why the assassination<br />\nof Anwar Sadat has caused a somewhat<br />\ndifferent reaction than the usual: people<br />\neverywhere realize that his death may have<br />\nsome tangible effect on their lives. Even on<br />\nthis campus, in such lively political forums<br />\nas the Gilman Coffee Shop, one heard more<br />\nthan the usual cynical remarks when the<br />\nnews hit.<br />\n\"Geez, that's really bad,\" a girl said<br />\nto her friend over doughnuts. \"I guess all<br />\nhell's going to break loose over there now.\"<br />\nHer guess is as good as anyone else's<br />\nright now, but if all hell breaks loose over<br />\nthere, we're going to more than feel the<br />\nripples here. If conversation in the Gilman<br />\n<br />\nCoffee Shop is any indication, we're feeling<br />\nthe first of them now: fear. Arab and<br />\nJewish Americans, of course, are the most<br />\ndirectly concerned about the sudden<br />\nchange in the power balance in the Mideast,<br />\nbut any thinking person should be aware of<br />\nhow dramatically the killing of Sadat<br />\nincreases the possibility of war. One can<br />\nonly hope that for stability's sake, the<br />\nnewly instated President Mubarak will have<br />\nthe inclination and the personal strength to<br />\ncarry through the peace work initiated by<br />\nSadat. If not, a war with Israel could all<br />\ntoo easily escalate into a wider conflict.<br />\nBut we, as a people who for the most<br />\npart have not had to accept guerrilla warfare<br />\nin the streets, cannot calculate the willingness of other nations to embrace direct<br />\nviolence as a means to an end. Just as we<br />\nare only dimly perceiving that this assassination will go beyond the others in its<br />\nconsequences, we are also at a loss to<br />\nunderstand the Arab people who rejoiced<br />\nin the streets when they heard Sadat was<br />\ndead. We haven't had, and we still don't<br />\nhave, the same things at stake that they do,<br />\nand so we can't understand jubilation as a<br />\nreaction to murder. Even those countries<br />\nwho think they will benefit from this<br />\nkilling, it seems to us, will do so in the<br />\nmost bloody way, at great' cost to themselves.<br />\nLet's hope that those in a position to<br />\nact realize the value of what Sadat was<br />\nworking for, and try to prevent violence<br />\nfrom becoming the completely accepted<br />\nnorm. Some of us are still at the point<br />\nwhere violence that affects our lives and<br />\nnot merely violence that remains contained<br />\nto the television set \u2014 is still truly horrible.<br />\n<br />\nProduction Staff<br />\nSuzanne Conklin<br />\nGranville Greene<br />\nMichael Lorton<br />\n<br />\nP.J.

If you were to ask<br />\neach of the 50 PSU members<br />\nwhat the purpose of the organization was. you would get 65<br />\ndifferent answers.<br />\nPhillip Schmandt, one of<br />\nthe students who organized the<br />\nPSU last spring, felt that there<br />\nwas a \"political vacuum\" at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Schmandt had<br />\nbeen a member of the College<br />\nRepublicans and the young<br />\nDemocrats, but he became disil-<br />\n<br />\nlusioned with those organizations because they seemed more<br />\ninterested in their own internal<br />\npolitics rather than in taking<br />\npart in off-campus political<br />\nHe felt that it was<br />\naction.<br />\nnecessary to create an independent group that is not affiliated<br />\nwith any national organization.<br />\nSchmandt wanted a group in<br />\nwhich students would care about<br />\nwho was elected president of the<br />\nnation instead of who was<br />\nelected president of the PSU.<br />\nIn keeping with these ideals,<br />\nthe PSU is not affiliated with<br />\nany national organization (although it is part of the Progressive Student Network \u2014 a loose<br />\ncommunications network of student organizations from about<br />\n40 colleges) and the PSU does<br />\nnot have any president. Meetings are run by a chairman who<br />\nis switched every second week.<br />\nHaving a rotating chairmanship does have disadvantages.<br />\nThere is no one who can speak<br />\non behalf of the PSU. This leads<br />\nto many different and often<br />\nconflicting reports on the purpose of the organization. Some<br />\nfeel that the purpose is to<br />\nincrease political awareness on<br />\ncampus; others see the organization as a place where members<br />\ncan learn about social and<br />\npolitical issues; still others would<br />\nlike to see the PSU become<br />\ninvolved in lobbying efforts or<br />\nelectoral.politics.<br />\nIn some ways the PSU<br />\nsatisfies all of these purposes.<br />\n<br />\nThe organization has several<br />\nstudy groups that research many<br />\nissues. The PSU also shows films<br />\nand holds forums semi-regularly.<br />\nAdditionally, the group maintains a literature table to present<br />\ninformation to Hopkins students. Two weeks ago, the PSU<br />\nsponsored a dance to raise funds<br />\nfor the Free Health Clinic on<br />\nGreenmount Avenue.<br />\nEven so, many PSU meetings are devoted to \"What<br />\ndirection should the group<br />\ntake?\" Because the PSU is very<br />\nbroad-based, some members are<br />\nunsure of what part they play<br />\nwithin the group.

She<br />\nstarted with the most common afterschool opiate, General Hospital. As often<br />\npredicted in such cases, Sara acquired a<br />\ntolerance to Gil. Unable to satiate her<br />\nneeds, she began watching All My<br />\nChildren and One Life to Live, frequently<br />\ntermed \"harder soaps.\"<br />\n\"Yes, I guess it did keep me from<br />\nmy schoolwork sometimes,\" Sara recalls.<br />\nHowever, with rehabilitation, Sara Richmond is one of the lucky few who can<br />\ntake Luke or leave him.<br />\nIn some extreme cases the habit<br />\nstarted early. Influenced by her sister,<br />\nBonnie Johnson formed a dependency at<br />\n12 years of age. However, her addiction<br />\nwas not as predictable or extensive as<br />\nAndrea Murray's. Andrea, although she<br />\ndid not get involved with soaps until<br />\nthe tenth grade, spent four hours of her<br />\nday charging herself with Ryan's Hope,<br />\nAll My Children, One Life to Live,<br />\nGeneral Hospital, and The Edge ofNight.<br />\nMurray and her classmates were attracted<br />\nfirst to Laura of GH.<br />\n\"She was our age,\" Andrea<br />\nexplains, \"yet she was starting a relationship with a thirty-five-year-old man.\"<br />\nClearly identification and idolatry is the<br />\nmajor factor in this case.<br />\nDarlene Marshall, actively influenced by her mother, was prescribed<br />\nGeneral Hospital to cure her boredom<br />\nand depression.

I figured I had to<br />\ntry it.\" Raji's predilection began in<br />\nSeptember of 1979, but ended aoruptly<br />\nwith the start of her college career.<br />\n\"I don't think I was as dependent<br />\nas I thought,\" Raji comments. \"I don't<br />\nmake time for Mitch Blake anymore.\"<br />\nUnfortunately; not everyone has<br />\nan easy time of unhooking themselves<br />\nfrom the afternoon hallucinogen. Many<br />\nstudents have not given up their habits,<br />\nnor do they find their dependencies<br />\n<br />\ndangerous. From 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., soap<br />\nis bubbling from the television set in the<br />\nlounge of Levering Hall. If anyone on<br />\ncampus has a death wish, existence could<br />\neasily be terminated by unplugging the<br />\nset or even standing in the way of Luke<br />\nand Laura during an intimate moment.<br />\nWhen asked why she was so<br />\nviolently attached to General Hospital, an<br />\nanonymous addict replied,\"After following the lives of these people for as long as<br />\nI have, they very nearly become real to<br />\nme.\"<br />\nUnlike anorexia nervosa, soap<br />\naddiction is not limited to those of the<br />\nfeminine gender. Senior Stephen Steckel<br />\nclaims to have exposed himself to two<br />\nweeks of General Hospital during its most<br />\npotent episodes (serious soap users will<br />\nrecall the \"romantic rape\" of Laura by<br />\nLuke, the man she really loved but<br />\ncouldn't get involved with because she<br />\nwas married to another loser, was taking<br />\nplace at that time. Of course, as everyone<br />\nknows, she was begging for it.)<br />\nAnother male soap addict, sophomore Bob Clayton, is not ashamed to<br />\nconfess his habit. Bob, like many antisoapers, never took soap seriously, only<br />\nwatching a few minutes of a serial just for<br />\na good laugh. Influenced by his sister,<br />\nClayton became a devout fanatic and has<br />\nbeen watching All My Children, One Life<br />\nto Live and General Hospital for three<br />\nyears.<br />\nYet another anonymous male<br />\nadmits to taking in an occasional glimpse<br />\nof GH.<br />\n\"There's nothing wrong with men<br />\nwatching soaps,\" he commented. It<br />\ncertainly is clear that daytime drama is no<br />\nlonger restricted to the frustrated homebound housewife.<br />\nThen there are the classic D-T-D<br />\ndespisers, who rally against the networks,<br />\nclaiming the imminent destruction of<br />\nFreshman Tamara Williams<br />\nminds.<br />\nexhausted herself exlaiming, \"They're<br />\nstupid; the characters are unbelievable<br />\nand oversexed.\"<br />\nSex is a very important compon-<br />\n<br />\nent in today's soaps, as most fanatics are<br />\nwell aware (this fact also being a motive<br />\nfor watching). For example, the necessary ingredients for the successful soap<br />\ninclude one or any combination of the<br />\na<br />\nfollowing character descriptions:<br />\nprostitute, a prostitute who was a housewife, a housewife who was a prostitute, a<br />\nformer prostitute now turned housewife<br />\nwho wants to start her own business at<br />\nhome, a pun who was formerly a prostitute, a \u2022nun who is a prostitute, and<br />\nseveral prostitutes.<br />\nIn addition to the sex standards,<br />\nthere are personality standards: individual representatives of good and evil. The<br />\nvillain of the old radio soaps has been<br />\ntransformed into a recognizable human<br />\nbeing. There is the cruel gossip of All My<br />\nChildren, Erica Kane; the rich witch of<br />\nOne Life to Live, Dorian Lord; and<br />\nCastadine from everybody's favorite,<br />\nGeneral Hospital.<br />\nOut of all the research and the<br />\ninterviews, I still did not uncover why<br />\nHabitual<br />\nsoap operas are addictive.<br />\nviewers will often admit that the plots are<br />\nstupid (if one exists), the acting terrible,<br />\nand the dialogue laughable. Still, what<br />\nhas caused Soap Opera Madness among<br />\nso many of America's youth, especially<br />\ncollege students? Do Hopkins premed<br />\nstudents really identify with the competent surgeons of the General Hospital? Is<br />\nthe Edge ofNight truly a factual image of<br />\nAmerican town life?<br />\n\"I get such a kick out of the little<br />\ntowns,\" said one viewer. \"Towns like<br />\nCenter City or Landview or Pine Valley.<br />\nDevin is sleeping with Shaun in some<br />\nhotel in this town not more than one mile<br />\nsquare. The whole town knows about it.<br />\nThey probably even synchronize their<br />\nwatches to the sexual activity. But of<br />\ncourse Devin's husband misses out on the<br />\nwhole scene.\"<br />\n\"I like the way soap opera time<br />\nruns,\" said another. \"Three weeks will<br />\npass according to my calendar, but on<br />\nOne Life to Live it's probably still Thursday.\"<br />\n<br />\n. Despite being a pre-med student. my favorite soap was not Gcticrui llospzta/ but All My Childrot. In fact I have never sat through a complete episode of<br />\nthe popular drama.<br />\nMany of the tickle soap lovers dropped :1111C because the popular DTD<br />\nheartthrob, Phillip, died while on police duty. However, many of us thought that<br />\nsomehow he would conic back. You sec, he had been thought dead before, but he<br />\nWas only missing in action in Viernam.<br />\nTara, his wife, had little faith in the Vietnam days and quickly married Dr.<br />\nChuck Tyler, grandson of Phoebe Tyler, the show's heavy. For a few years she<br />\npretended to be paralyzed, racing aroundin a wheelchair. Phoebe,of course, is as<br />\nsnobbish as she is wealthy. She despises her grandson's new wife (Phillip did come<br />\nhome from Vietnam and remarried Tara, tossing Chuck out of the picture).<br />\nDonna, who is the show's former prostitute turned housewife. At fifteen Donna<br />\nhad her tubes tied secretly during an appendectomy funded by her pimp. Because<br />\nshe is infertile she tried buying a black-market baby (another soap educational<br />\nepisode). However. Chuck didn't like the idea of buying a baby., it seemed too<br />\nunnatural to him. Ile was happy playing father to Tara and Phillip's psychologically unstable brat, Phillip Jr., who liked to be called Charlie to make things even<br />\nmore confusing. This made Donna jealous, so Chuck divorced her to live with an<br />\nultra-fertile college girl. Under all the pressure, the former prostitute moved in<br />\nwith her friend Nina Cortland. Donna eventually married Nina's selfish, manipulative, and wealthy father, Palmer Cortland. Most everyone thinks Mrs. Cortland,<br />\nNina's mother, is dead, but she's not. Because Palmer was so selfish and stifling,<br />\nshe grew to hate him and began sleeping with the gardener. Cortland paid her half<br />\na million and royalties to move to France and leave Nina with him,. Of course she<br />\nreturns to Pine Valley under an assumed name and becomes one of Nina's closest<br />\nfriends. Surprisingly, no one has discovered her true identity. All are even<br />\noblivious to the fact that the Cortland housekeeper, Mrs. Murdoch, is Nina's<br />\ngrandmother.<br />\nI could go on, but I would rather not. I hope 1 haven't tempted anyone<br />\ninto rushing to his TV set. I would hate to be responsible for \"turning anyone on<br />\nto soap.\" Being an addict once myself, I did my share of \"pushing.\" It was then<br />\nthat I realized that I had to quit. I saw my once-normal friends spending hours<br />\nstrung out on All My Children. The horrible fact that I was fo blame, that I had<br />\nstilled them on Ryan's Hope and slipped them AMC to get them totally hooked<br />\nand dependent, really hit home with me.<br />\n<br />\nAnalyzing myself and my addiction, I found curiosity is what kept my<br />\nhabit alive. I really wondered how far the<br />\nwriters could push and manipulate the<br />\nlimited characters. I honestly believed<br />\nthey were having a hilarious time forcing<br />\nthe actors into ridiculous situations \u2014<br />\nthe whole prostitution cycle, for example. However, I do admit there was some<br />\nseriousness involved in my attachment.<br />\nLiving in New York I ran into some of<br />\nmy favorite stars in the street. Was it<br />\nadmiration that made me speechless and<br />\n(I'm so ashamed) fawn? As I matured,<br />\nI found that I could handle the situation.<br />\nLast summer I was bold enough to walk<br />\nconfidently past the guard and into the<br />\nstudios of All My Children. I held on to<br />\nmy dignity when speaking and arguing<br />\nwith the adulterers Wally McFadden and<br />\nBetsy Kenicut, and interrogated the<br />\nwriters, discovering Sybil Thorne's murderer. Contrary to what I had assumed,<br />\nall those I met were rather serious about<br />\nwhat they were doing. Even Erica Kane,<br />\nwhose role I consider intolerably laughable, retains a straight face as she rehearses her lines.<br />\nHowever, the sad part of soaps is<br />\nthe serious involvement of the viewer. In<br />\nthe longest running D-T-D, Search for<br />\nTomorrow, addicts sent flowers and even<br />\ndressed for the occasion of a character's<br />\nwedding. There is also considerable<br />\nanxiety displayed over a character's<br />\nwell-being.<br />\n\"No Luke, don't go in there!\"<br />\n\"Nina, don't listen to your father,<br />\nyou spineless idiot.\"<br />\n\"Oh no, Dorian is up to something.\" These are but a few exclamations<br />\ncommon to the actively involved soap<br />\nwatcher. Yes, I did leave one out, didn't<br />\nI?<br />\n\"Oh Laura, go on and sleep with<br />\nLuke already.\"<br />\nAfter all this analysis, many of<br />\nyou may be wondering whether there is a<br />\npositive side to daytime drama at all?<br />\nThis question could be asked about most<br />\nAnd<br />\nanything on television today.<br />\nlike regular television, soap does attempt<br />\nto educate. Nina, the diabetic of All My<br />\nChildren, was convinced she was going<br />\nblind and could not marry Dr. Cliff<br />\nWarner. It was not difficult to comprehend that the writers were transmitting<br />\ninformation to the large population of<br />\nviewers who have diabetes, think they are<br />\ngoing blind, but really aren't. Therefore,<br />\nas many an addict will agree, there is<br />\nsome social relevance to the daytime<br />\ndrama. It informs and educates, helps<br />\nrelease (and often build up) sexual<br />\ntension, and soap is fun to follow. However, in excess it is habit-forming. Like<br />\nmany of the people interviewed today,<br />\nyou too could wind up strung out on<br />\nGH, the THC of daytime TV. Or maybe,<br />\nyour roomate will find you alone taking<br />\nheavy doses of Ryan's Hope. Perhaps,<br />\nlike me, you will try just one at a party of<br />\na friend's house, for the flimsy reason<br />\nthat \"everyone is doing it,\" then you<br />\nwon't be able to stay away. Soap could<br />\nruin your life; you could wind up being<br />\nthe extreme case of the friendless junkie.<br />\nDespite my efforts to convince<br />\nthe Levering Lounge addicts of the<br />\ndangers of soaps, they ignored me,<br />\ninsisting that they knew what they were<br />\ndoing and arguing, \"Well, at least it<br />\ndoesn't cause cancer.\" Little do they<br />\nknow that daytime drama is fast becoming the substitute for college drinking. A<br />\nword to the wise and wary, tell your<br />\nchildren; it could happen to you and you<br />\nand you and you and you and<br />\n<br />\n\f49i<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nexiddiefito4vs)<br />\n<br />\nChris Kelly sat on a bar stool in<br />\nfront of one of the machines in the<br />\nCharles Village Pub. His right hand moved<br />\nquickly over the buttons on the machine's control panel. His left hand<br />\ngrasped a ball-tipped lever which he<br />\nwould, at short and irregular intervals,<br />\nmanipulate in his attempts to defeat his<br />\nvideo enemies. His eyes were fixed on an<br />\nelectronic screen upon which was being<br />\nfought a violent but bloodless war.<br />\nFor more than five minutes I<br />\nwatched as Kelly fought his electronic<br />\nbattle. Finally, though still enthralled by<br />\nthe combat before him, he whispered a<br />\nfew inaudible words in my direction,<br />\nmore to acknowledge my presence than<br />\nto impart some important message to me.<br />\nI immediately seized the opportunity to<br />\nintroduce myself, and then to explain<br />\nthat I was writing a story about the use of<br />\narcade games.<br />\nAt that moment an explosion<br />\noccurred on the screen and I swiftly came<br />\nto the realization that Kelly's video<br />\nembodiment was now a non-entity. He<br />\nturned to me and, picking up on my last<br />\nwords, said with a smile, \"Or misuse.\"<br />\n<br />\nKelly is a Baltimore working man,<br />\nnow in his middle twenties. He has been<br />\nplaying arcade games since he was eight<br />\nyears old, and while he does not consider<br />\nhimself an expert, he proudly declares,\"I<br />\ncan beat the scores of most people.\"<br />\nHe spends, on averaged, six to eight hours<br />\neach week in front of the video screens or<br />\nat the knobs of a pinball machine. \"I<br />\nstarted with pinball,\" he says, \"and it<br />\nmeans something to me. That is why I<br />\nstill play.\"<br />\nKelly is but one of the seemingly<br />\nendless number of avid arcade-game<br />\nplayers who crowd the game-rooms, not<br />\nonly of this country, but most of the<br />\nwestern world. Ray Tannahill, an owner<br />\nof the Charles Village Pub, says his three<br />\nvideo games are constantly in use and,<br />\nafter nightfall, there is usually a line to<br />\nget to them. \"People,\" says Tannahill,<br />\n\"come in here just to play the games, not<br />\nto buy anything.\"<br />\nTannahill does not appear to be<br />\nparticularly upset by the fact that his<br />\nestablishment is often frequented by<br />\nthose who wish only to use his video<br />\ngames. When asked how his business is<br />\ndoing with the machines he simply<br />\nresponds, \"Very well.\" It seems that the<br />\nCharles Village Pub profits not only from<br />\nthe quarters that are regularly pumped<br />\ninto its machines \u2014 $25 to $45 each<br />\nday \u2014 but also from the company which<br />\nrents the tavern these video belligerents.<br />\nIn return for a three-year agreement to<br />\nuse their machines, the company which<br />\nsells and rents such games as Pac Man,<br />\n<br />\nB3fftY3Z.G<br />\n<br />\nPhoenix and Defender helped finance, at I had a machine and start playing.\" Others<br />\na low interest rate, the tavern's renova- mark the beginning of their playing days<br />\ntion.

Although no one is guilty of<br />\ncuckoldry, lago creates for Othello (and<br />\noften the audience) a world of stealthy<br />\nencounters and double entendres with<br />\nsuch airy evidence as words and a misplaced lace handkerchief. lago is a Satan<br />\nin Othello's and Desdemona's Eden,<br />\nirretrievably corrupting their orderly<br />\nhappiness with his contagious jealousy.<br />\nBut the actors take care to stress<br />\nlines which reveal that lago's sins \u2014 his<br />\nenvy, self-interest, beguiling speech and<br />\ntreason \u2014 also exist even in the play's<br />\nmost honorable characters.<br />\nCassio<br />\n(Kelsey Grammer), the lieutenant whose<br />\nposition lago covets, is himself consumed<br />\nwith worry about his personal reputation<br />\nand rank, so much so that love would<br />\nnever lead him into actions that would<br />\nthreaten either. Othello is a sometimes<br />\nmodest, sometimes boastful, master of<br />\nwords: \"this only is the witchcraft\" he<br />\nused to seduce Desdemona. Desdemona<br />\nembraces his spoken autobiography as his<br />\nidentity with the same passion that<br />\nOthello accepts lago's carefully phrased<br />\naccusations about Desdemona's unfaithfulness. Even Desdemona's understandable betrayal of her father when she<br />\nelopes with Othello is a betrayal that<br />\ngradually kills the aged sire and plants a<br />\nsuspicion in all minds that perhaps no<br />\ncommitment is eternal. \"Look to her,<br />\nMoor,if thou hast eyes to see,\" the father<br />\nwarns. \"She has deceived her father\" and<br />\nmay thee.\" lago, as a devil of jealousy,<br />\nintensifies a lifetime of petty doubts and<br />\nconflict into three days of rage and<br />\nmurder. Plummer wittily portrays this<br />\nguileful fiend who has such an uncanny<br />\nunderstanding of human weaknesses.<br />\nThe acting in this production is<br />\nstrongly representational. The theatrical<br />\nnature of actions and speedi is stressed<br />\nrather than hidden. Plummer's lago is<br />\nstrangely likable; we can feel an evil<br />\npleasure watching this small man skillfully undermine the mountainous James<br />\nEarl Jones as Othello. Both actors are at<br />\ntheir best together. They make good use<br />\nof. their contrasting appearance and<br />\nmanners in a surprisingly physical interaction. Plummer plays lago as a foppish,<br />\nembracing Italian, more the waiter in a<br />\nfour-star restaurant than a veteran military man, and thereby increases his<br />\nsympathetic characterization.<br />\nIn the<br />\nmonologues, however, Plummer either<br />\nbecomes a stereotype of villainy as he<br />\nrants with fists belabouring the air, or<br />\nperforms a changeable jumble of actions.<br />\nplayfully tipping a chair only to fall in<br />\ninternal anguish over it.

Philip Arnoult,<br />\nwho is still its director today, founded<br />\nthe Project in 1971 as the theater wing of<br />\nAntioch College, and by 1975 it had<br />\ngrown to become an independent corporation. The philosophy of the Project is<br />\ntwofold: to make the dramatic arts not<br />\nonly accessible to, but often a collaboration with, the local communities of<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nAs a graduate student at Catholic<br />\nUniversity in 1963, Arnoult discovered<br />\nthat only 1.3 percent of the public<br />\nattends even one live performance per<br />\nyear, and that percentage consisting<br />\nmostly of well-educated, fairly well-to-do<br />\nurban and suburban whites. His desire to<br />\nbring theater to the rest of the public is<br />\nreflected in the policies of the Theatre<br />\nProject: admission is free, no reservations<br />\nor subscriptions are necessary, and formal<br />\ndress is not required. The result is<br />\na comfortable, relaxed theatergoing experience in an intimate (seating: 125)<br />\nsetting.

Many<br />\nparallels between the two exist, some of<br />\nwhich are disturbing. First, Hall & Oates<br />\nseem to have totally abandoned slow<br />\nsongs; gone forever is the pristine melodiousness that we haven't seen since \"Wait<br />\nfor Me\" on X-Static (1979). There is not<br />\na single slow tempo on Private Eyes, and<br />\nVoices' sole offering in that department<br />\nwas \"Everytime You Go Away,\" which<br />\nwas much closer to a slow blues rap than<br />\nto anything in the tradition of \"Sara<br />\nSmile.\"<br />\nSecond, John Oates is gradually<br />\nrelinquishing his creative contribution to<br />\nthe group's output.

The<br />\nteam, led by first-year coach<br />\nKay Fowler, appears in excellent<br />\nform as it has defeated most of<br />\nits opponents decisively. The<br />\nteam also has one of the tightest<br />\nschedules, as it will play twelve<br />\nmatches in less than a month.<br />\nThe season started on a very<br />\nenthusiastic note September 24<br />\nat Trinity as the Blue Jays<br />\ngained an easy 7-2 victory. The<br />\nteam then played host to two<br />\ntraditional rivals, Widener and<br />\nLoyola. The players breezed to<br />\ndecisive victories, as they all got<br />\non top early in their matches.<br />\nFowler, though excited over<br />\nthe victories, was skeptical about<br />\n.her team's performance. Though<br />\nall the members were playing<br />\nsuperb singles, they were not<br />\nperforming well at the number<br />\ntwo and three doubles spots.<br />\nShe also believed that. her team<br />\nhad not been tested yet,and was<br />\nafraid of a letdown.<br />\nThe team was looking forward to its next opponent,<br />\nSwarthmore, traditionally one of<br />\nHopkins' toughest rivals. The<br />\nteam was enthusiastic about<br />\nplaying the Quakers, as all<br />\nmembers were eager to prove<br />\nthat their fast start was not a<br />\nfluke. Fowler also wanted to<br />\n<br />\ntest her players' mental toughness against some established<br />\nopponents.<br />\n\"1 he team passed the test,<br />\nand the result was a hard-fought,<br />\nwell-earned 54 victory for<br />\nHopkins. The Jays won, once<br />\nagain on the basis of their<br />\nexceptional strength in singles.<br />\nHowever, Fowler was also very<br />\npleased with the performance of<br />\nMeri-Jo<br />\nNina<br />\nand<br />\nUrbin<br />\nBorzilleri at the number two<br />\ndoubles spot. She believed that<br />\nthey could complement the<br />\nstrong number one team of Amy<br />\nGeraldine<br />\nBuchanon<br />\nand<br />\nKlauber very well.<br />\nThe team continued its<br />\nexceptional performance by defeating Goucher at home and<br />\nNotre Dame away by 9-0 scores.<br />\nFowler can boast of having<br />\na very strong lineup with exceptional depth. It is headed by<br />\nCheryl Volgelstein, a very competitive, consistent player. A'<br />\ntransfer student from Trinity.<br />\nGeraldine Klauber plays a fluid,<br />\naggressive game. Amy Buchanon<br />\nand Nina Urbin both move their<br />\nopponents around from the<br />\nbaseline, and they top off their<br />\ntalents with very consistent<br />\nserves. Men -Jo Borzilleri has<br />\ndeveloped a strong serve-andvolley game. There are several<br />\nother players whose high level of<br />\nperformance has been one of the<br />\nmain reasons for the team's<br />\n<br />\nNext Week:<br />\n<br />\nNina Urbill hits a smashing backhand.<br />\n<br />\nsuccess so far.<br />\nAccording to Fowler, there<br />\nis a lot of enthusiasm among<br />\nteam members, both from new<br />\nand returning players. They<br />\nhave all been working very hard,<br />\nand this has been reflected in<br />\ntheir performance on the court.<br />\nShe believes that enthusiasm and<br />\nhustle are as important in<br />\nindividual sports, like tennis, as<br />\nthey are in team sports. The<br />\nplayers have been very supportive of each other and that will<br />\nbecome more important as the<br />\nseason progresses. For now,<br />\nFowler does not foresee major<br />\nupsets by any other teams, but is<br />\nlooking forward to Oct. 14,<br />\nwhen the Jays will be hosting<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, a team<br />\nthey have not defeated in eight<br />\nyears.<br />\nAfter that they will<br />\nparticipate in the MAIAW<br />\nTournament Oct. 16 and 17.<br />\n<br />\nIt Could Be Lonely<br />\nBY STEVE EISENBERG<br />\nThe eight ball and the<br />\ncenterfielder.<br />\nThe balls are racked up.<br />\nThe eight ball being in the<br />\nmiddle.

Now OTID<br />\nserves both SMPY and the<br />\nProgram for Verbally Gifted<br />\nYouth (PVGY).<br /><br />\nBarnett explained that those<br />\ngifted children who perform<br />\nexceptionally well on the SAT<br />\nare invited to take courses<br />\nespecially designed to suit their<br />\nneeds. PVGY aims at strengthening the student's writing skills<br />\nby offering classes at Hopkins in<br />\nwriting, critical reading, Latin,<br />\netymology, and German. SMPY<br />\nallows the gifted student the<br />\nopportunity to cover pre-calculus math.

No amount of<br />\nobjective evidence seems to<br />\nmake a dent in this prejudice,<br />\nwhich is often entwined with a<br />\nsuperficial democratic ethic that<br />\ndemands the same curricular<br />\ntreatment for all children except<br />\nobviously slow learners.\"<br />\nIn his article, Stanley turned<br />\nto psychologist Lewis Terman's<br />\nstudies for evidence against<br />\nthe stereotypes of the accelerated child. \"Terman found that<br />\nmost prejudices about persons<br />\nwho as children had scored high<br />\non intelligence tests were unfounded.

We know that the endless<br />\nviolence barraging us through the media has<br />\nleft us unable to react with anything more<br />\nthan a shrug at each new killing.<br />\nYet there is an aspect of this jaded<br />\nattitude, of this having seen the most<br />\nhorrible twists that one could reasonably<br />\nexpect to see, that makes us perhaps better<br />\njudges of a truly catastrophic event when it<br />\ncomes along. Part of the reason that we<br />\nhave been reduced to shrugging at assassinations is that, in a tangible way, they have<br />\nhad no real effect on our daily lives. While<br />\none could write volumes about how different this country would be today if the<br />\nKennedys and Martin Luther King had<br />\nlived, there was little perceptible change for<br />\nmost people directly after those men were<br />\ngone. No state of martial law was declared,<br />\nthere was no revolution in the streets, and<br />\nthere was still food on the table.<br />\nThat may be why the assassination<br />\nof Anwar Sadat has caused a somewhat<br />\ndifferent reaction than the usual: people<br />\neverywhere realize that his death may have<br />\nsome tangible effect on their lives. Even on<br />\nthis campus, in such lively political forums<br />\nas the Gilman Coffee Shop, one heard more<br />\nthan the usual cynical remarks when the<br />\nnews hit.<br />\n\"Geez, that's really bad,\" a girl said<br />\nto her friend over doughnuts. \"I guess all<br />\nhell's going to break loose over there now.\"<br />\nHer guess is as good as anyone else's<br />\nright now, but if all hell breaks loose over<br />\nthere, we're going to more than feel the<br />\nripples here. If conversation in the Gilman<br /><br />\nCoffee Shop is any indication, we're feeling<br />\nthe first of them now: fear. Arab and<br />\nJewish Americans, of course, are the most<br />\ndirectly concerned about the sudden<br />\nchange in the power balance in the Mideast,<br />\nbut any thinking person should be aware of<br />\nhow dramatically the killing of Sadat<br />\nincreases the possibility of war. One can<br />\nonly hope that for stability's sake, the<br />\nnewly instated President Mubarak will have<br />\nthe inclination and the personal strength to<br />\ncarry through the peace work initiated by<br />\nSadat. If not, a war with Israel could all<br />\ntoo easily escalate into a wider conflict.<br />\nBut we, as a people who for the most<br />\npart have not had to accept guerrilla warfare<br />\nin the streets, cannot calculate the willingness of other nations to embrace direct<br />\nviolence as a means to an end. Just as we<br />\nare only dimly perceiving that this assassination will go beyond the others in its<br />\nconsequences, we are also at a loss to<br />\nunderstand the Arab people who rejoiced<br />\nin the streets when they heard Sadat was<br />\ndead. We haven't had, and we still don't<br />\nhave, the same things at stake that they do,<br />\nand so we can't understand jubilation as a<br />\nreaction to murder. Even those countries<br />\nwho think they will benefit from this<br />\nkilling, it seems to us, will do so in the<br />\nmost bloody way, at great' cost to themselves.<br />\nLet's hope that those in a position to<br />\nact realize the value of what Sadat was<br />\nworking for, and try to prevent violence<br />\nfrom becoming the completely accepted<br />\nnorm. Some of us are still at the point<br />\nwhere violence that affects our lives and<br />\nnot merely violence that remains contained<br />\nto the television set \u2014 is still truly horrible.<br /><br />\nProduction Staff<br />\nSuzanne Conklin<br />\nGranville Greene<br />\nMichael Lorton<br /><br />\nP.J.

ARA is a<br />\nbusiness and as a business, it<br />\ncannot admit persons under the<br />\nlegal minimum drinking age of<br />\nMaryland. It may seem inconsistent to allow underage people<br />\ninto Frat and Orientation parties<br />\n(among others), but the same<br />\nkind of legal risk isn't involved<br />\nhere.<br />\nUsing a stamp as a marker<br />\nfor age would not work and the<br />\nreasons are very obvious \u2014<br />\nespecially to the people who<br /><br />\nsneak into the Rat by transferring the ink on one person's hand<br />\nto their own.

It's not because we<br />\nare trying to exclude you from<br />\nhaving a good time, it's the law.<br />\nIf you come to the Rat, I'll<br />\nhave to turn you away, but if<br />\nyou come to one of my Frat<br />\nparties (at TEP) I'll probably let<br />\nyou in. The only differences<br />\nbetween the two places are that<br />\nwe at TEP Fraternity have no<br />\nmorals and barely any respect<br />\nfor the law \u2014 and know how to<br />\nhave damn good parties too.<br />\nIf you still don't understand<br />\nwhat I'm saying, get in touch<br />\nwith me, and I'll explain it to<br />\nyou over a few pitchers of beer<br />\nsometime...<br /><br />\nin the September 25, 1981 issue<br />\ncontained some factual errors<br />\nconcerning the Biomedical Engineering/Bioengineering major.<br />\nFurther, the article seemed to<br />\nadd to the confusion it reported.<br />\nBioengineering was established as a committee-run undergraduate major in academic<br />\nyear 1974-75.

Does<br />\none get \"turned onto\" soaps by a friend?<br />\nOr does afternoon boredom cause one to<br />\nreluctantly take in a show, getting the<br />\nvulnerable hooked?<br />\nFreshman Sara Richmond formed<br />\nher habit from peer pressure.<br />\n\"I felt that if I didn't try it, I<br />\nwouldn't be one of them,\" she says. She<br />\nstarted with the most common afterschool opiate, General Hospital. As often<br />\npredicted in such cases, Sara acquired a<br />\ntolerance to Gil. Unable to satiate her<br />\nneeds, she began watching All My<br />\nChildren and One Life to Live, frequently<br />\ntermed \"harder soaps.\"<br />\n\"Yes, I guess it did keep me from<br />\nmy schoolwork sometimes,\" Sara recalls.<br />\nHowever, with rehabilitation, Sara Richmond is one of the lucky few who can<br />\ntake Luke or leave him.<br />\nIn some extreme cases the habit<br />\nstarted early. Influenced by her sister,<br />\nBonnie Johnson formed a dependency at<br />\n12 years of age. However, her addiction<br />\nwas not as predictable or extensive as<br />\nAndrea Murray's. Andrea, although she<br />\ndid not get involved with soaps until<br />\nthe tenth grade, spent four hours of her<br />\nday charging herself with Ryan's Hope,<br />\nAll My Children, One Life to Live,<br />\nGeneral Hospital, and The Edge ofNight.<br />\nMurray and her classmates were attracted<br />\nfirst to Laura of GH.<br />\n\"She was our age,\" Andrea<br />\nexplains, \"yet she was starting a relationship with a thirty-five-year-old man.\"<br />\nClearly identification and idolatry is the<br />\nmajor factor in this case.<br />\nDarlene Marshall, actively influenced by her mother, was prescribed<br />\nGeneral Hospital to cure her boredom<br />\nand depression. By contrast, Raji Mulukutla's inclination to Another World<br />\ngrew out of rebellion.<br />\n\"My mother said she didn't want<br />\nme watching daytime drama,\" Raji<br />\nexplains. \"It's like Eve eating the apple.<br />\nShe made me curious. I figured I had to<br />\ntry it.\" Raji's predilection began in<br />\nSeptember of 1979, but ended aoruptly<br />\nwith the start of her college career.<br />\n\"I don't think I was as dependent<br />\nas I thought,\" Raji comments. \"I don't<br />\nmake time for Mitch Blake anymore.\"<br />\nUnfortunately; not everyone has<br />\nan easy time of unhooking themselves<br />\nfrom the afternoon hallucinogen. Many<br />\nstudents have not given up their habits,<br />\nnor do they find their dependencies<br /><br />\ndangerous. From 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., soap<br />\nis bubbling from the television set in the<br />\nlounge of Levering Hall. If anyone on<br />\ncampus has a death wish, existence could<br />\neasily be terminated by unplugging the<br />\nset or even standing in the way of Luke<br />\nand Laura during an intimate moment.<br />\nWhen asked why she was so<br />\nviolently attached to General Hospital, an<br />\nanonymous addict replied,\"After following the lives of these people for as long as<br />\nI have, they very nearly become real to<br />\nme.\"<br />\nUnlike anorexia nervosa, soap<br />\naddiction is not limited to those of the<br />\nfeminine gender. Senior Stephen Steckel<br />\nclaims to have exposed himself to two<br />\nweeks of General Hospital during its most<br />\npotent episodes (serious soap users will<br />\nrecall the \"romantic rape\" of Laura by<br />\nLuke, the man she really loved but<br />\ncouldn't get involved with because she<br />\nwas married to another loser, was taking<br />\nplace at that time. Of course, as everyone<br />\nknows, she was begging for it.)<br />\nAnother male soap addict, sophomore Bob Clayton, is not ashamed to<br />\nconfess his habit. Bob, like many antisoapers, never took soap seriously, only<br />\nwatching a few minutes of a serial just for<br />\na good laugh. Influenced by his sister,<br />\nClayton became a devout fanatic and has<br />\nbeen watching All My Children, One Life<br />\nto Live and General Hospital for three<br />\nyears.<br />\nYet another anonymous male<br />\nadmits to taking in an occasional glimpse<br />\nof GH.<br />\n\"There's nothing wrong with men<br />\nwatching soaps,\" he commented. It<br />\ncertainly is clear that daytime drama is no<br />\nlonger restricted to the frustrated homebound housewife.<br />\nThen there are the classic D-T-D<br />\ndespisers, who rally against the networks,<br />\nclaiming the imminent destruction of<br />\nFreshman Tamara Williams<br />\nminds.<br />\nexhausted herself exlaiming, \"They're<br />\nstupid; the characters are unbelievable<br />\nand oversexed.\"<br />\nSex is a very important compon-<br /><br />\nent in today's soaps, as most fanatics are<br />\nwell aware (this fact also being a motive<br />\nfor watching). For example, the necessary ingredients for the successful soap<br />\ninclude one or any combination of the<br />\na<br />\nfollowing character descriptions:<br />\nprostitute, a prostitute who was a housewife, a housewife who was a prostitute, a<br />\nformer prostitute now turned housewife<br />\nwho wants to start her own business at<br />\nhome, a pun who was formerly a prostitute, a \u2022nun who is a prostitute, and<br />\nseveral prostitutes.<br />\nIn addition to the sex standards,<br />\nthere are personality standards: individual representatives of good and evil. The<br />\nvillain of the old radio soaps has been<br />\ntransformed into a recognizable human<br />\nbeing. There is the cruel gossip of All My<br />\nChildren, Erica Kane; the rich witch of<br />\nOne Life to Live, Dorian Lord; and<br />\nCastadine from everybody's favorite,<br />\nGeneral Hospital.<br />\nOut of all the research and the<br />\ninterviews, I still did not uncover why<br />\nHabitual<br />\nsoap operas are addictive.<br />\nviewers will often admit that the plots are<br />\nstupid (if one exists), the acting terrible,<br />\nand the dialogue laughable. Still, what<br />\nhas caused Soap Opera Madness among<br />\nso many of America's youth, especially<br />\ncollege students? Do Hopkins premed<br />\nstudents really identify with the competent surgeons of the General Hospital? Is<br />\nthe Edge ofNight truly a factual image of<br />\nAmerican town life?<br />\n\"I get such a kick out of the little<br />\ntowns,\" said one viewer. \"Towns like<br />\nCenter City or Landview or Pine Valley.<br />\nDevin is sleeping with Shaun in some<br />\nhotel in this town not more than one mile<br />\nsquare. The whole town knows about it.<br />\nThey probably even synchronize their<br />\nwatches to the sexual activity. But of<br />\ncourse Devin's husband misses out on the<br />\nwhole scene.\"<br />\n\"I like the way soap opera time<br />\nruns,\" said another. \"Three weeks will<br />\npass according to my calendar, but on<br />\nOne Life to Live it's probably still Thursday.\"<br /><br />\n. Despite being a pre-med student. my favorite soap was not Gcticrui llospzta/ but All My Childrot. In fact I have never sat through a complete episode of<br />\nthe popular drama.<br />\nMany of the tickle soap lovers dropped :1111C because the popular DTD<br />\nheartthrob, Phillip, died while on police duty. However, many of us thought that<br />\nsomehow he would conic back. You sec, he had been thought dead before, but he<br />\nWas only missing in action in Viernam.<br />\nTara, his wife, had little faith in the Vietnam days and quickly married Dr.<br />\nChuck Tyler, grandson of Phoebe Tyler, the show's heavy. For a few years she<br />\npretended to be paralyzed, racing aroundin a wheelchair. Phoebe,of course, is as<br />\nsnobbish as she is wealthy. She despises her grandson's new wife (Phillip did come<br />\nhome from Vietnam and remarried Tara, tossing Chuck out of the picture).<br />\nDonna, who is the show's former prostitute turned housewife. At fifteen Donna<br />\nhad her tubes tied secretly during an appendectomy funded by her pimp. Because<br />\nshe is infertile she tried buying a black-market baby (another soap educational<br />\nepisode). However. Chuck didn't like the idea of buying a baby., it seemed too<br />\nunnatural to him. Ile was happy playing father to Tara and Phillip's psychologically unstable brat, Phillip Jr., who liked to be called Charlie to make things even<br />\nmore confusing. This made Donna jealous, so Chuck divorced her to live with an<br />\nultra-fertile college girl. Under all the pressure, the former prostitute moved in<br />\nwith her friend Nina Cortland. Donna eventually married Nina's selfish, manipulative, and wealthy father, Palmer Cortland. Most everyone thinks Mrs. Cortland,<br />\nNina's mother, is dead, but she's not. Because Palmer was so selfish and stifling,<br />\nshe grew to hate him and began sleeping with the gardener. Cortland paid her half<br />\na million and royalties to move to France and leave Nina with him,. Of course she<br />\nreturns to Pine Valley under an assumed name and becomes one of Nina's closest<br />\nfriends. Surprisingly, no one has discovered her true identity. All are even<br />\noblivious to the fact that the Cortland housekeeper, Mrs. Murdoch, is Nina's<br />\ngrandmother.<br />\nI could go on, but I would rather not. I hope 1 haven't tempted anyone<br />\ninto rushing to his TV set. I would hate to be responsible for \"turning anyone on<br />\nto soap.\" Being an addict once myself, I did my share of \"pushing.\" It was then<br />\nthat I realized that I had to quit. I saw my once-normal friends spending hours<br />\nstrung out on All My Children. The horrible fact that I was fo blame, that I had<br />\nstilled them on Ryan's Hope and slipped them AMC to get them totally hooked<br />\nand dependent, really hit home with me.<br /><br />\nAnalyzing myself and my addiction, I found curiosity is what kept my<br />\nhabit alive. I really wondered how far the<br />\nwriters could push and manipulate the<br />\nlimited characters. I honestly believed<br />\nthey were having a hilarious time forcing<br />\nthe actors into ridiculous situations \u2014<br />\nthe whole prostitution cycle, for example. However, I do admit there was some<br />\nseriousness involved in my attachment.<br />\nLiving in New York I ran into some of<br />\nmy favorite stars in the street. Was it<br />\nadmiration that made me speechless and<br />\n(I'm so ashamed) fawn? As I matured,<br />\nI found that I could handle the situation.<br />\nLast summer I was bold enough to walk<br />\nconfidently past the guard and into the<br />\nstudios of All My Children. I held on to<br />\nmy dignity when speaking and arguing<br />\nwith the adulterers Wally McFadden and<br />\nBetsy Kenicut, and interrogated the<br />\nwriters, discovering Sybil Thorne's murderer. Contrary to what I had assumed,<br />\nall those I met were rather serious about<br />\nwhat they were doing. Even Erica Kane,<br />\nwhose role I consider intolerably laughable, retains a straight face as she rehearses her lines.<br />\nHowever, the sad part of soaps is<br />\nthe serious involvement of the viewer. In<br />\nthe longest running D-T-D, Search for<br />\nTomorrow, addicts sent flowers and even<br />\ndressed for the occasion of a character's<br />\nwedding. There is also considerable<br />\nanxiety displayed over a character's<br />\nwell-being.<br />\n\"No Luke, don't go in there!\"<br />\n\"Nina, don't listen to your father,<br />\nyou spineless idiot.\"<br />\n\"Oh no, Dorian is up to something.\" These are but a few exclamations<br />\ncommon to the actively involved soap<br />\nwatcher. Yes, I did leave one out, didn't<br />\nI?<br />\n\"Oh Laura, go on and sleep with<br />\nLuke already.\"<br />\nAfter all this analysis, many of<br />\nyou may be wondering whether there is a<br />\npositive side to daytime drama at all?<br />\nThis question could be asked about most<br />\nAnd<br />\nanything on television today.<br />\nlike regular television, soap does attempt<br />\nto educate. Nina, the diabetic of All My<br />\nChildren, was convinced she was going<br />\nblind and could not marry Dr. Cliff<br />\nWarner. It was not difficult to comprehend that the writers were transmitting<br />\ninformation to the large population of<br />\nviewers who have diabetes, think they are<br />\ngoing blind, but really aren't. Therefore,<br />\nas many an addict will agree, there is<br />\nsome social relevance to the daytime<br />\ndrama. It informs and educates, helps<br />\nrelease (and often build up) sexual<br />\ntension, and soap is fun to follow. However, in excess it is habit-forming. Like<br />\nmany of the people interviewed today,<br />\nyou too could wind up strung out on<br />\nGH, the THC of daytime TV. Or maybe,<br />\nyour roomate will find you alone taking<br />\nheavy doses of Ryan's Hope. Perhaps,<br />\nlike me, you will try just one at a party of<br />\na friend's house, for the flimsy reason<br />\nthat \"everyone is doing it,\" then you<br />\nwon't be able to stay away. Soap could<br />\nruin your life; you could wind up being<br />\nthe extreme case of the friendless junkie.<br />\nDespite my efforts to convince<br />\nthe Levering Lounge addicts of the<br />\ndangers of soaps, they ignored me,<br />\ninsisting that they knew what they were<br />\ndoing and arguing, \"Well, at least it<br />\ndoesn't cause cancer.\" Little do they<br />\nknow that daytime drama is fast becoming the substitute for college drinking. A<br />\nword to the wise and wary, tell your<br />\nchildren; it could happen to you and you<br />\nand you and you and you and<br /><br />\n49i<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nexiddiefito4vs)<br /><br />\nChris Kelly sat on a bar stool in<br />\nfront of one of the machines in the<br />\nCharles Village Pub. His right hand moved<br />\nquickly over the buttons on the machine's control panel. His left hand<br />\ngrasped a ball-tipped lever which he<br />\nwould, at short and irregular intervals,<br />\nmanipulate in his attempts to defeat his<br />\nvideo enemies. His eyes were fixed on an<br />\nelectronic screen upon which was being<br />\nfought a violent but bloodless war.<br />\nFor more than five minutes I<br />\nwatched as Kelly fought his electronic<br />\nbattle. Finally, though still enthralled by<br />\nthe combat before him, he whispered a<br />\nfew inaudible words in my direction,<br />\nmore to acknowledge my presence than<br />\nto impart some important message to me.<br />\nI immediately seized the opportunity to<br />\nintroduce myself, and then to explain<br />\nthat I was writing a story about the use of<br />\narcade games.<br />\nAt that moment an explosion<br />\noccurred on the screen and I swiftly came<br />\nto the realization that Kelly's video<br />\nembodiment was now a non-entity. He<br />\nturned to me and, picking up on my last<br />\nwords, said with a smile, \"Or misuse.\"<br /><br />\nKelly is a Baltimore working man,<br />\nnow in his middle twenties. He has been<br />\nplaying arcade games since he was eight<br />\nyears old, and while he does not consider<br />\nhimself an expert, he proudly declares,\"I<br />\ncan beat the scores of most people.\"<br />\nHe spends, on averaged, six to eight hours<br />\neach week in front of the video screens or<br />\nat the knobs of a pinball machine. \"I<br />\nstarted with pinball,\" he says, \"and it<br />\nmeans something to me. That is why I<br />\nstill play.\"<br />\nKelly is but one of the seemingly<br />\nendless number of avid arcade-game<br />\nplayers who crowd the game-rooms, not<br />\nonly of this country, but most of the<br />\nwestern world. Ray Tannahill, an owner<br />\nof the Charles Village Pub, says his three<br />\nvideo games are constantly in use and,<br />\nafter nightfall, there is usually a line to<br />\nget to them. \"People,\" says Tannahill,<br />\n\"come in here just to play the games, not<br />\nto buy anything.\"<br />\nTannahill does not appear to be<br />\nparticularly upset by the fact that his<br />\nestablishment is often frequented by<br />\nthose who wish only to use his video<br />\ngames. When asked how his business is<br />\ndoing with the machines he simply<br />\nresponds, \"Very well.\" It seems that the<br />\nCharles Village Pub profits not only from<br />\nthe quarters that are regularly pumped<br />\ninto its machines \u2014 $25 to $45 each<br />\nday \u2014 but also from the company which<br />\nrents the tavern these video belligerents.<br />\nIn return for a three-year agreement to<br />\nuse their machines, the company which<br />\nsells and rents such games as Pac Man,<br /><br />\nB3fftY3Z.G<br /><br />\nPhoenix and Defender helped finance, at I had a machine and start playing.\" Others<br />\na low interest rate, the tavern's renova- mark the beginning of their playing days<br />\ntion.

Its high<br />\nceilings and multi-paned windows make<br />\nthe room resemble a great ballroom or<br />\nfine dining room worthy of $1000-perplace china.

Although no one is guilty of<br />\ncuckoldry, lago creates for Othello (and<br />\noften the audience) a world of stealthy<br />\nencounters and double entendres with<br />\nsuch airy evidence as words and a misplaced lace handkerchief. lago is a Satan<br />\nin Othello's and Desdemona's Eden,<br />\nirretrievably corrupting their orderly<br />\nhappiness with his contagious jealousy.<br />\nBut the actors take care to stress<br />\nlines which reveal that lago's sins \u2014 his<br />\nenvy, self-interest, beguiling speech and<br />\ntreason \u2014 also exist even in the play's<br />\nmost honorable characters.<br />\nCassio<br />\n(Kelsey Grammer), the lieutenant whose<br />\nposition lago covets, is himself consumed<br />\nwith worry about his personal reputation<br />\nand rank, so much so that love would<br />\nnever lead him into actions that would<br />\nthreaten either. Othello is a sometimes<br />\nmodest, sometimes boastful, master of<br />\nwords: \"this only is the witchcraft\" he<br />\nused to seduce Desdemona. Desdemona<br />\nembraces his spoken autobiography as his<br />\nidentity with the same passion that<br />\nOthello accepts lago's carefully phrased<br />\naccusations about Desdemona's unfaithfulness. Even Desdemona's understandable betrayal of her father when she<br />\nelopes with Othello is a betrayal that<br />\ngradually kills the aged sire and plants a<br />\nsuspicion in all minds that perhaps no<br />\ncommitment is eternal. \"Look to her,<br />\nMoor,if thou hast eyes to see,\" the father<br />\nwarns. \"She has deceived her father\" and<br />\nmay thee.\" lago, as a devil of jealousy,<br />\nintensifies a lifetime of petty doubts and<br />\nconflict into three days of rage and<br />\nmurder. Plummer wittily portrays this<br />\nguileful fiend who has such an uncanny<br />\nunderstanding of human weaknesses.<br />\nThe acting in this production is<br />\nstrongly representational. The theatrical<br />\nnature of actions and speedi is stressed<br />\nrather than hidden. Plummer's lago is<br />\nstrangely likable; we can feel an evil<br />\npleasure watching this small man skillfully undermine the mountainous James<br />\nEarl Jones as Othello. Both actors are at<br />\ntheir best together. They make good use<br />\nof. their contrasting appearance and<br />\nmanners in a surprisingly physical interaction. Plummer plays lago as a foppish,<br />\nembracing Italian, more the waiter in a<br />\nfour-star restaurant than a veteran military man, and thereby increases his<br />\nsympathetic characterization.<br />\nIn the<br />\nmonologues, however, Plummer either<br />\nbecomes a stereotype of villainy as he<br />\nrants with fists belabouring the air, or<br />\nperforms a changeable jumble of actions.<br />\nplayfully tipping a chair only to fall in<br />\ninternal anguish over it.

This is all part of the representational style of acting and direction.<br />\nThe show climaxes in the middle<br />\nas lago's plots come vividly to fruition<br />\nand Othello sees his \"perfect\" world as its<br />\nopposite. Then the play plods through its<br />\nfinal series of macabre acts and solemn<br />\npronouncements. In the final scene,<br />\nDesdemona is caged by shadowed slats of<br />\nVenetian blinds cast by the reddish<br />\nstreetlight (a stunning visual effect); all<br />\nthe actors acquire the weariness of caged<br />\nanimals pacing through an inevitable<br />\nresolution.

The students<br />\nwould then perform in the city's parks<br />\nthroughout the summer, displaying such<br />\ntalents 'as juggling, dance, mime, and<br />\nface-painting, among others.

Philip Arnoult,<br />\nwho is still its director today, founded<br />\nthe Project in 1971 as the theater wing of<br />\nAntioch College, and by 1975 it had<br />\ngrown to become an independent corporation. The philosophy of the Project is<br />\ntwofold: to make the dramatic arts not<br />\nonly accessible to, but often a collaboration with, the local communities of<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nAs a graduate student at Catholic<br />\nUniversity in 1963, Arnoult discovered<br />\nthat only 1.3 percent of the public<br />\nattends even one live performance per<br />\nyear, and that percentage consisting<br />\nmostly of well-educated, fairly well-to-do<br />\nurban and suburban whites. His desire to<br />\nbring theater to the rest of the public is<br />\nreflected in the policies of the Theatre<br />\nProject: admission is free, no reservations<br />\nor subscriptions are necessary, and formal<br />\ndress is not required. The result is<br />\na comfortable, relaxed theatergoing experience in an intimate (seating: 125)<br />\nsetting. Since its fou.nding, the Project<br />\nhas held more than 2500. performances,<br />\nfeaturing approximately 375 different<br />\nartists or troupes from 26 states in the<br />\nU.S. and 17 foreign countries.<br />\nThe .Theatre Project has been<br />\nlabeled -\"alternative\" and \"avant garde\"<br />\nbecause its fare is such a radical departure<br />\nfrom the run-of-the-mill Broadway reincarnations offered by theaters such<br />\nas the Mechanic and Center Stage. While<br />\nthese showplaces resemble nothing so<br />\nmuch as little pieces of the new York<br />\nstage cut and transplanted for Baltimore<br />\nconsumption, the people at the Theatre<br />\nProject like to think of themselves as<br />\nbeing more fully integrated with the city<br />\nand the needs of its inhabitants.

First, Hall &amp; Oates<br />\nseem to have totally abandoned slow<br />\nsongs; gone forever is the pristine melodiousness that we haven't seen since \"Wait<br />\nfor Me\" on X-Static (1979). There is not<br />\na single slow tempo on Private Eyes, and<br />\nVoices' sole offering in that department<br />\nwas \"Everytime You Go Away,\" which<br />\nwas much closer to a slow blues rap than<br />\nto anything in the tradition of \"Sara<br />\nSmile.\"<br />\nSecond, John Oates is gradually<br />\nrelinquishing his creative contribution to<br />\nthe group's output.

The<br />\nteam, led by first-year coach<br />\nKay Fowler, appears in excellent<br />\nform as it has defeated most of<br />\nits opponents decisively. The<br />\nteam also has one of the tightest<br />\nschedules, as it will play twelve<br />\nmatches in less than a month.<br />\nThe season started on a very<br />\nenthusiastic note September 24<br />\nat Trinity as the Blue Jays<br />\ngained an easy 7-2 victory. The<br />\nteam then played host to two<br />\ntraditional rivals, Widener and<br />\nLoyola. The players breezed to<br />\ndecisive victories, as they all got<br />\non top early in their matches.<br />\nFowler, though excited over<br />\nthe victories, was skeptical about<br />\n.her team's performance. Though<br />\nall the members were playing<br />\nsuperb singles, they were not<br />\nperforming well at the number<br />\ntwo and three doubles spots.<br />\nShe also believed that. her team<br />\nhad not been tested yet,and was<br />\nafraid of a letdown.<br />\nThe team was looking forward to its next opponent,<br />\nSwarthmore, traditionally one of<br />\nHopkins' toughest rivals. The<br />\nteam was enthusiastic about<br />\nplaying the Quakers, as all<br />\nmembers were eager to prove<br />\nthat their fast start was not a<br />\nfluke. Fowler also wanted to<br /><br />\ntest her players' mental toughness against some established<br />\nopponents.<br />\n\"1 he team passed the test,<br />\nand the result was a hard-fought,<br />\nwell-earned 54 victory for<br />\nHopkins. The Jays won, once<br />\nagain on the basis of their<br />\nexceptional strength in singles.<br />\nHowever, Fowler was also very<br />\npleased with the performance of<br />\nMeri-Jo<br />\nNina<br />\nand<br />\nUrbin<br />\nBorzilleri at the number two<br />\ndoubles spot. She believed that<br />\nthey could complement the<br />\nstrong number one team of Amy<br />\nGeraldine<br />\nBuchanon<br />\nand<br />\nKlauber very well.<br />\nThe team continued its<br />\nexceptional performance by defeating Goucher at home and<br />\nNotre Dame away by 9-0 scores.<br />\nFowler can boast of having<br />\na very strong lineup with exceptional depth. It is headed by<br />\nCheryl Volgelstein, a very competitive, consistent player. A'<br />\ntransfer student from Trinity.<br />\nGeraldine Klauber plays a fluid,<br />\naggressive game. Amy Buchanon<br />\nand Nina Urbin both move their<br />\nopponents around from the<br />\nbaseline, and they top off their<br />\ntalents with very consistent<br />\nserves. Men -Jo Borzilleri has<br />\ndeveloped a strong serve-andvolley game. There are several<br />\nother players whose high level of<br />\nperformance has been one of the<br />\nmain reasons for the team's<br /><br />\nNext Week:<br /><br />\nNina Urbill hits a smashing backhand.<br /><br />\nsuccess so far.<br />\nAccording to Fowler, there<br />\nis a lot of enthusiasm among<br />\nteam members, both from new<br />\nand returning players. They<br />\nhave all been working very hard,<br />\nand this has been reflected in<br />\ntheir performance on the court.<br />\nShe believes that enthusiasm and<br />\nhustle are as important in<br />\nindividual sports, like tennis, as<br />\nthey are in team sports. The<br />\nplayers have been very supportive of each other and that will<br />\nbecome more important as the<br />\nseason progresses. For now,<br />\nFowler does not foresee major<br />\nupsets by any other teams, but is<br />\nlooking forward to Oct. 14,<br />\nwhen the Jays will be hosting<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, a team<br />\nthey have not defeated in eight<br />\nyears.<br />\nAfter that they will<br />\nparticipate in the MAIAW<br />\nTournament Oct. 16 and 17.<br /><br />\nIt Could Be Lonely<br />\nBY STEVE EISENBERG<br />\nThe eight ball and the<br />\ncenterfielder.<br />\nThe balls are racked up.<br />\nThe eight ball being in the<br />\nmiddle.
