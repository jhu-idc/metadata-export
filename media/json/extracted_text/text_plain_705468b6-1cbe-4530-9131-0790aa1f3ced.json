The proposed Center<br />\nwould be primarily involved in<br />\n\"study and research at pre- and<br />\npost doctoral levels\" as well as<br />\nin faculty research.<br />\nThe need for such an institution, said the proposal, is evidenced by the numerous crises<br />\nstemming from the inadequate<br />\norganization of essential social<br />\nenterprises. There . is also a<br />\ngrowing but unsystematized body<br />\nof knowledge concerning administrative science. Thus educa4ion;systematization of existing knowledge, and further research in the field of administration would be functions of the<br />\nnew Center.<br />\nThe faculty for such an institution would be drawn from existing<br />\nUniversity<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nAdditional faculty would be recruited by each department to<br />\nwork in the Center. \"For example, a scholar interested in the<br />\nbehavior of formal organizations would be a peer colleague<br />\nin the department of Psychology<br />\nand have the additional opportunity to participate in activities<br />\nof the Center,\" the proposal stated.<br />\nGraduate and post-doctoral<br />\nfellows would be admitted to regular departments, and could<br />\nchoose whether or not they desired associationwith the Center.<br />\nThe proposal said that \"programs and degree requirements<br />\nfor students working in association with the Center would be subject to the same standards of<br />\nquality and the same governance<br />\nas other degree candidates.\"<br />\nBoth theoretical and applied<br />\nresearch would be carried on at<br />\nthe Center. The report proposed<br />\n<br />\nthat organizations, such as large<br />\ncorporations of the U.S. Government, might be willing to provide<br />\nfunds for research. Theoretical<br />\nstudies, said the proposal, might<br />\ninclude \"such topics as value,<br />\ndecision, organization, and control theory,\" while applied research might involve \"design of<br />\na health care or educational systerm, or a computerized information network.''<br />\nThe proposal advocated that<br />\nundergraduates take part in both<br />\ncourses and research programs<br />\nof the Center. Such participation,<br />\nsuggests the proposal, \"would<br />\nhelp to blur the undergraduategraduate student demarcation<br />\nwhich has concerned this and<br />\nother universities.\"<br />\nIn addition to graduate and undergraduate participation, the<br />\nCenter would involve a number of<br />\nnon-degree students in its cognate programs. Such programs<br />\nwould serve non-degree students<br />\nfrom the ranks of outside organizations, and bring them abreast<br />\nof developments in such fields<br />\nas computer science, operations<br />\nresearch, and other disciplines<br />\nrelated to administrative science.<br />\nThe report proposes that the<br />\nCenter be housed in a self-contained building that would cost<br />\nan estimated ten to fifteen million dollars. These funds, suggests the proposal, might be provided by a foundation grant and<br />\nby government funds.

When asked if disappointment with Hopkins was the<br />\ncause of the forthcoming move,<br />\nDr. Mills replied that he was<br />\n\"very happy here\" and that his<br />\nreasons for leaving did not lie in<br />\nany personal dissatisfaction with<br />\nHopkins. He added that he had<br />\nbeen offered a \"very good position\" at Princeton, a position<br />\nwhich involved a new faculty post<br />\nand which represented an advancement of his academic career.<br />\n<br />\nLooking Back<br />\nLooking back on his.. years at<br />\nHopkins, he gave some of his impressions of the quality of life<br />\nhere. He commented on such<br />\nmajor issues as governance,<br />\ngrowth of faculty and student bodies, and teaching of undergraduates.<br />\nOn the issue of University governance, Dr. Mills stated that it is<br />\n\"an important and complex issue\" but that there is \"no urgency\" in dealing with it.

It's<br />\nnot clear what that means, but<br />\n<br />\nI think if it means anything it<br />\nmeans something that would be<br />\nIncompatible<br />\nwith<br />\nbusinessoriented sort of work.\"<br />\nOne dejected member of the<br />\nOperations Research Department<br />\ncommented after the proceedings<br />\nthat the attitude of the humanities<br />\n<br />\nfaculty and the hard scientists<br />\n(physics, chemistry, biology, as<br />\nopposed<br />\nto<br />\nengineers) was<br />\n\"sneering\" and that they reacted<br />\nnegatively without thinking any<br />\ntime the word \"business\" was<br />\nmentioned. He claimed that the<br />\nfaculty's<br />\nattitude reflected a<br />\nbasic misunderstanding of what<br />\nadministrative science consists<br />\nof.<br />\n<br />\ncould be adopted with Hopkins<br />\nstill remaining the smallest<br />\nmajor university in the East. In<br />\nthe University's present condition, additional funds are very<br />\nhard to obtain and faculty growth has become nonexistant.

According to<br />\nDr. Mills, the size of the Political<br />\nEconomy Department's faculty<br />\nshould be increased from seven to<br />\nat least eleven or twelve members.

He stated that the Committee has not given up and will continue its<br />\nwork, as long as the President refuses to give a firm commitment for pulling out of Vietnam.<br />\nKudlow described the Committee as having been<br />\n\"relatively invisible\" for the last few months. However,<br />\nhe said that it has been working quietly to set up seven<br />\nregional offices across the country. In addition the Committee has been making plans for March and April activities.<br />\n<br />\nings, planned for the following week.<br />\nFor April 15 massive, nationwide tax demonstrations<br />\nare being planned. A great effort will be made to involve<br />\nmiddle and lower class adults in the antiwar cause. Kudlow<br />\nsaid that the Moratorium Committee plans a low-keyed<br />\neffort to draw critical relationships between military<br />\npolicy and economic problems, such as Nixon's HEW veto<br />\nand his requests for ABM appropriations. Moratorium<br />\nworkers will attempt to prove how the Vietnam War is<br />\nresponsible for tax hikes, inflation, the threat of recession,<br />\nand the decrease in the buying power of money.<br />\nKudlow<br />\ndeclared the Moratorium Committee to be<br />\nopposed to \"Nixon's illusion of the silent majority, not to<br />\nthe American people...I don't believe that people are<br />\nreally supporting the President.If you scratch one,quarter<br />\ninch below the surface, you'll see great frustration and rising discontent,\" he said. The Committee will try to show<br />\nthe people that \"it is Nixon and Laird who are polarizing<br />\nthe country, not us.\"<br />\n<br />\nCivil Disobedience<br />\n<br />\nAmericans Are Nonpolitical<br />\n<br />\nBy HOWARD LEVENSON<br />\n<br />\nIn March action will center around draft boards, with<br />\nrallies and vigils. Civil disobedience will be emphasized.<br />\nIt will take the form of a massive \"We Won't Go\" statement, hopefully to be released at a press conference in<br />\nWashington.<br />\nThe Committee is seeking a direct confrontation with the<br />\nSelective Service System.It hopes to organize ten thousand<br />\ndraftees to refuse induction. Kudlow said that the government would not prosecute ten thousand draft resisters.<br />\nHe said that the government is already letting draft resisters go free, citing as an example the refusal to prosecute<br />\nDavid Hawk of the Moratorium Committee.<br />\nKudlow said that ultimately he and his co-workers seek<br />\nrepeal of the draft and its replacement with a volunteer<br />\narmy. He emphasized that the Moratorium Committee has<br />\nnot decided on this course of action because of opposition<br />\nto all wars and warfare, but because of opposition to the<br />\nVietnam War.<br />\nThe statements on the draft and the volunteer army are<br />\nto be released the week of March 16, so as to coordinate<br />\nwith the anti-draft week being organized by the New<br />\nMobilization Committee for the week of March 16-23.<br />\nIn addition, it is timed to immediately precede draft hear-<br />\n<br />\nKudlow expressed the belief that most Americans are not<br />\npolitical people, but that they are governed by a economic<br />\nself-interest. He said that this is not all bad, because \"a<br />\ncounty with two hundred million activists would be one-dimensional.\" He attributed a great deal of the cold reception given by adults to past Moratorium activities to the<br />\nfact that people either feel very uncomfortable discussing<br />\ndissent or feel as if the Moratorium workers are wasting<br />\ntheir precious time.<br />\n\"Our leaders will have to admit that we have made a<br />\ntragic mistake,\" said Kudlow. \"I hope all of you go home<br />\nand think about the state of this country, and commit yourselves to working with us as long as the war goes on.\"<br />\nHe described the turnout, for his speech and the antiwar<br />\ndocumentary \"Vietnam: in The Year of the Pig,\" as \"encouraging.\" The event was held to benefit the Baltimore<br />\nVietnam Moratorium Committee.<br />\n<br />\nSpeeches At Goucher<br />\nThe film was shown again on Friday night at Goucher,<br />\naccompanied by speeches by both Kudlow and David Hawk,<br />\nNational Coordinator for the Moratorium.Kudlow again<br />\nemphasized the necessity of continuing to broaden the<br />\n<br />\nWant a Classified?<br />\nUse this easy to fill out form.<br />\nHEADING:<br />\n<br />\nEat-in, Carry-out<br />\n<br />\nJEN'S<br />\n<br />\n3121 ST.

It has been equally common for members of the<br />\nStudent Council to accuse the News-Letter of a great deal<br />\nof empty criticism and distortion of the news. This year's<br />\nsituation is, however, different. Neither has the Student<br />\nCouncil been in the public eye, nor has it done very much<br />\nto rise to its own defense.<br />\nIn fact, the conduct of the Council in the past few<br />\nmonths has been so scandalously negligent as to raise<br />\nquestions anew about its necessity and usefulness. Not<br />\nonly has the S.C. consistently refrained from attacking the<br />\nmultifold problems of the community, but it has been slow<br />\neven to deal with questions and conflicts unearthed by the<br />\nother groups on campus. What is even more disheartening<br />\nis the fact that recent meetings have either been cancelled<br />\nor 'tampered with' due to lack of attendance.<br />\nFigures from the Council's roll book indicate that one<br />\nmember has five unexcused absences, three members have<br />\nthree nch, and eight others have one apiece. Counting<br />\nexcused absences--a process which essentially involves a<br />\npre-meeting announcement of the fact\u2014the number is substantially higher.<br />\nNone of these shortcomings and weaknesses, however,<br />\ncan compare with the S.C.'s actions of the past few days.<br />\nIn a series of virtually unparalleled moves, it went past admitting its ineffectiveness at dealing with foreign issues to<br />\nan :admission of helplessness at coping with its own constitution.<br />\nBy refusing to discipline its wayward members, the<br />\nCouncil has virtually given up any pretensions of power,<br />\nprestige or influence. It is an implicit admission to students, faculty and administration alike that nothing the<br />\ncouncil officially does need be taken seriously, since it<br />\ncannot even take the question of its own attendance seriously.<br />\nIt is clear to all that there are a number of weak and<br />\nconfusing aspects to the Council's constitution. The membership question is one of these, in that no clear procedural<br />\nmatters have been delineated by which a member is officially expelled. For the S.C. to deal with this legislatively<br />\nwould be a laudable, if not necessary, step. The fact, however, that procedure was entirely and blithely ignored lends<br />\nconsiderable doubt to the Council's ability to deal properly<br />\nand legalistically with any serious issue twhich, confronts<br />\nthat body.<br />\n<br />\ncG<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nMlgrog,miglzaza<br />\nON 710 WALL- \u2014 Mb/5<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nFAIREsT OF<br />\nTNE.44 ALLT<br />\n<br />\ni --1, A.k<br />\niv<br />\n<br />\nBy A.

Not to be left out of this illustrious fraternity, Lincoln Gordon has now taken<br />\nto attacking the media.<br />\n<br />\nTUESDAY<br />\nday editor<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\n<br />\nSome of you may not have caught last Friday's<br />\nsmall, page 3, story on a News-Letter interview with Gordon. That interview took place<br />\nat 9:30 on a Monday *morning. I had been up<br />\nuntil 4:30 that morning working on the paper.<br />\nNow, I don't usually get up anywhere around<br />\n9:00 on a normal Monday, much less after only<br />\nfour hours of sleep. But there I was, standing,<br />\ntotally out-of-it, in Homewood House, little knowing that I and the two other N-L people with me<br />\nwere about to get verbally lashed for our issue<br />\nof the previous Friday. \"<br />\nSome of Gordon's juicier comments were left<br />\nout of the news article, but what he said was,<br />\nin effect, he resented our reacting so soon to his<br />\ndiscipline proposal, chastising us to \"do our<br />\nhomework before you write your next pieces on<br />\nthe matter.\" (Sounds sorta' like oP.Spiro talking<br />\nabout the bad effects of the TV men immediately<br />\ngiving their commentary on poor Dick's speech.)<br />\n<br />\nAd Horninum<br />\nGordon seemed especially peeved over the<br />\ncolumn which this author penned, and took full<br />\nadvantage of my presence (in body if not in<br />\nmind) to tell me so. He stated that my column<br />\ndid not deal objectively with the issues, as it<br />\n\"cheats out of arguments ad hominum.\"<br />\nWell, now, as if I didn't know it didn't deal<br />\nobjectively with the subject. Of course it didn't.<br />\nIt wasn't supposed to. Any fool could have seen<br />\nthat. Going on the assumption that the fallacies<br />\nin Gordon's discipline code were obvious to even<br />\nthe most untrained eye, the column simply attempted to throw in some of the more obvious<br />\n(and damaging) arguments against that code,<br />\nwhile dealing with the problem in its larger<br />\ncontext, all done in a hopefully entertaining<br />\nfashion.<br />\nYes, President Gordon, I had done my homework, I had read your code, and am quite familiar with the whole subject. But a step-by-step<br />\ncataloging of the logical inconsistencies in your<br />\ncode would have consumed pages of boring rhetoric, so it was decided that a newspaper column is not the place for such a thing.<br />\n<br />\nHill<br />\n<br />\nAfter all, Gordon's arguments were presented for all to read in a beautiful four page spread,<br />\nand it was not really necessary to give them<br />\nequal time in that commentary. So it was written, and so it stands.<br />\n<br />\nLook It Up<br />\nThe President also suggested to me that \"you<br />\nmight do well if you look up the dictionary definition of paranoia and see where the shoe really<br />\nfits.\" Well, I must admit, 1 have neglected my<br />\nduty, and will have to rely on the definition I<br />\npicked up last semester in abnormal psych.<br />\nAnd the fact that the shoe still fits so perfectly<br />\non Gordon's foot I suppose might be blamed<br />\non Dr. Shaffer for teaching me all I know about<br />\nthe subject.<br />\nBut the problem still remains about those<br />\nobjective arguments. They are so numerous<br />\nand complex that I categorically refuse, in order<br />\nto preserve my sanity and yours, to write them<br />\nout for publication. I had hoped that whatever<br />\npetition was gotten up would include them, but<br />\napparently those campus-conscious individuals<br />\nwho take care of such things ran into the same<br />\ncomplex boredom that I did. After all, God knows<br />\nthat everybody at Hopkins has been instructed<br />\nby their father figure not to sign anything they<br />\nhaven't read, and so a seventeen page petition<br />\nwouldn't get too far.<br />\n<br />\nA Proposition<br />\nThe only way to possibly make such things interesting would be to have some sort of public<br />\ndiscussion about them, far from the burden of<br />\nthe printed page. And, so for these reasons, I<br />\ndo hereby challange Lincoln Gordon to a debate<br />\non the discipline issue. This is for real. Out<br />\nIn the public, with constructive speeches, rebuttals, cross-examination, the whole schticke<br />\nWe could work out the working of the proposition together, but I presume that Gordon would<br />\nbe on the affirmative and I would take the negative, and, of course, you would be the judge.<br />\nSo, Mr. President, if you really aren't paranoid, think about it. If, as you claim, I haven't<br />\ndone my homework and can only use ad hominum<br />\narguments, it would be a pushover? The same<br />\nwould be true if you really weren't as arbitrary<br />\nas has been claimed. In any case, it could be<br />\nnothing more or less than a clearing of the air<br />\nabout the entire subject. So, think about it, and<br />\nif interested, please reply in care of the NewsLetter;<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\nGOVERNANCE BEFORE DISCIPLINE<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nThe dispute between Lincoln Gordon and the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee over the disciplinary<br />\ncode has raised a more vital question. While<br />\nthe community talks about which of two code,<br />\nversions is best, the conflict underlying the<br />\ndiscussion more fundamentally involves how Hopkins is to be governed.<br />\nThe New University Conference chapter at Hopkins believes a much fuller discussion of these<br />\nissues by the university as a whole is required.<br />\nTo consider the issue of conduct apart from that<br />\nof governance is nonsenical. How can we be<br />\nexpected to accept arbitrary decisions on university order when the very principles on how<br />\n<br />\nAst/ DEM?...

Ubu! Ubu Roil<br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nAn answer to the inevitable what to do this weekend<br />\nquestion. For one of the next two weekends, anyway.<br />\nNot a movie, as every film in tewn is either rated G<br />\nor is one that you saw in New York two months ago. A<br />\nPlay.<br />\nFor those of you who missed the microscopic posters, Theatre Hopkins is currently presenting Alfred<br />\nJarry's Ubu Roi in the Barn Theatre. First produced<br />\nin 1896, causing literal and literary riots, this seminal<br />\nwork has been of unquestionably significant influence in<br />\nthe history of modern theatre.<br />\nAs a first crack in the<br />\nwalls of Hugo-Zola realism and late Victorianism, Ubu<br />\nRol spawned the Gallic madness<br />\nof Dada and Surrealism<br />\nand the absurdity of Beckett<br />\nand Ionesco which we still<br />\nadmire to srespectfully today.<br />\nPerhaps this is the only value of Ubu Rol, as a piece<br />\nof historical<br />\ninterest rather than literary merit. The<br />\navant-garde of 1896 bears little surprise for today's<br />\nplaywatcher -- note the relative calm with which Grotowsky's revolutionary Polish Laboratory Theatre was<br />\nreceived. Attending Jarry's play is almost analagous<br />\nto those<br />\nintolerable semesters of survey courses and<br />\nprerequisites (you know, the \"necessary background\"<br />\nbullshit.) It would be analagous if Ubu Rol were not<br />\nentertaining.<br />\n<br />\nGarbled Green Candles<br />\nA puppeteer opens the play by manipulating some marionnettes while crossing and re-crossing the stage, muttering something barely discernable (very poor enunciation) about a green candle. Later on another character<br />\nSpeaks of a green candle, but his lines were garbled and<br />\nunintelligible also. So much for the symbolism of green<br />\n<br />\ncandles.<br />\nThen the two main characters, Mere and Pere Ubu,<br />\nappear. Captain of the Dragoons and a former king of<br />\nAragon, Pere Ubu \u201e; is a crude slob who is persuaded by<br />\nhis wife to murder the reigning king of Poland and assume<br />\nthe throne. ,(Jarry wrote, \"As for the action - that takes<br />\nplace in Poland - that is to say - nowhere.\") The Ubus'<br />\nconspiracy succeeds, assasinating- all but the moronic<br />\nprince Bougrelas. An oppressive totalitarianism is<br />\nestablished, imposing exorbitant taxes and executing all<br />\nthe notiles, magistrates, and financiers.<br />\nPere Ubu's lust for money and blood can be restrained<br />\nonly by his dominating trait, cowardice. He becomes<br />\nhelpless with fear at the thought of Bougrelas,the legitimate heir sworn to vengenace in a scene which amateurishly parodies the' ghost scene in Hamlet.<br />\n<br />\nSea-Sick Sailors<br />\nWhen one of Pere Ubu's fellow conspirators turns against him, war results. His gaudy ostentation waving<br />\nin the breeze, Pere Ubu gallops off to smashing defeat,<br />\nthough it is not. clear whether anyone has won. Pere<br />\nUbu, his wife, and their loyal flunkies end up sea sick<br />\nand alone on a ship, until an actor displays a sign<br />\nreading \"End\". (This play concludes in a manner<br />\nstrikingly similar to Ingmar Bergman's recent Shame.)<br />\nAlthough an important milestone in the twentieth century's attack on reason and order, Ubu Rol seems quaintly mild today. Jarry's humor is concentrated in the use<br />\nof broad slapstick and grotesque shifts of action and<br />\nmood. Theatre Hopkins has augmented the script with<br />\nmany humorous touches: corpses which flutter their<br />\narms and float off stage like angles, a messenger who<br />\nleaps on stage and freezes in the one-point stance of<br />\n<br />\nMercury. The dialogue, though witty in spots, is mostly on a par with a Three Stooges short (which is not<br />\nto say that it is bad, but...)<br />\nJarry's battle against meaning does show in the total<br />\nunreality of his exaggerated characters and events. All<br />\nthe conventional \"themes\" which the play seems to relate -- war and greed are bad,crime does not pay, etc. -are so overwhelmed by the absurdity that they are ridiculed into non-existence.<br />\n<br />\nAdded Devices Distracting<br />\nUnfortunately, Jarry's original script has been expanded by some superfluous and confusing devices. The puppeteer at the opening of the play and the prominent<br />\nprescence of four large dice as part of the set immediately suggests fate, chance, life is a game, man is manipulated by Unknown Powers, etc., etc. These are ideas<br />\nwhich do not appear in the dialogue or action at all.<br />\nTheatre Hopkins' choice of props was wise - birdcages<br />\nfor royal crowns, a dust shovel for Pere Ubu's sceptre<br />\nof power, and a curved cane (Pere Ubu calls it his \"shitter\") employed alternately as a sword, whip, and telescope. Much is added by the imaginative costuming:<br />\nPere Ubu is bloated to the proportions of three Santa<br />\nClauses, his wife appears with lewdly gargantuan .bust<br />\nand buttocks.<br />\nA word on the acting. The characters are flat unidimensional silhouettes and should be played that way.<br />\nDonald Hart does just that in the role of Pere Ubu. Mere<br />\nUbu is done by Ruth Lawson Walsh, who adds an enjoyable amount of coarse spirit and boisterousness to her<br />\npart. ,And the role of Captain Bordure acquires comic<br />\nelements totally independent of Jarry's words, due to<br />\nJoe Bandiera's hilarious diction.<br />\n<br />\nigarren Calvert St.,0 Barren People<br />\nBy BRUCE DRAKE<br />\nUnder a stack of shoddy-looking<br />\nPapers -- on top, two old notices of<br />\nClassification, a student telephone directory, and some notes on Cell Biology -Ifound what follows.<br />\nYou may ask why.it belongs in a<br />\nnewspaper, and I'm not sure.

The results are as before: smooth<br />\nskin, soft little breasts and a tongue<br />\nwhich never failed to excite him since<br />\nhe saw her licking an ice cream cone in<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nThe results are the same because he<br />\nhad catalogued her in his fantasies before.

He hears<br />\nthem laugh as he indifferently rinses the<br />\nspaghetti stuff he had just cooked off his<br />\nhands.<br />\nI--tensely sits through the meal and<br />\nmore anxiously watches Kelly and his<br />\nroom-mate (let's call him L--)get more<br />\nstoned on dope and Canadian Club. Kelly<br />\ngot real lively and began to horse around<br />\nwith L--while Marcia looked on, smiling. L-- is feeling fine and occasionally screeches some inanity which I-forces himself to answer wittily.<br />\nL--suggests hitting a party around the<br />\nblock. I--consents, seeing hewas making<br />\nno progress, and hopes to steal a few<br />\nfurtive feels under cover of a party's<br />\nnoise and gaiety.<br />\nHe knows he made a mistake whenthey<br />\nreach the party. It is one of those dreary<br />\nSt. Paul St. apartments which looked like<br />\n<br />\nexcitement.<br />\nShe throws sand in them.<br />\n\"Cut it out, Piggy,\" she snaps.(She<br />\ncalled him Piggy, he hated that).<br />\nI--dials the number. Thank God she<br />\nanswered, he thought, and not her father.<br />\nShe asks him to hold on. Five minutes<br />\npass and he notes the phone bill tacked<br />\nto the wall, saying \"I--'s calls to N.Y.-$53.\"<br />\n\"What do youwant? You just called last<br />\nnight, Piggy.\"<br />\n<br />\nIt was Friday afternoon in early spring.<br />\nI-- is despondent. The windows are open,<br />\nand really fine, warm air blows in. God,<br />\nhow he hated Calvert St.<br />\nHe sees one of the toothless old men<br />\nstruggle up the block to Peabody's, probably for his afternoon bowl of chowder.<br />\nHe sees whatshername...Sugar...waddling across the street while some big<br />\ngoon from AEPi runs up and pinches her<br />\nmassive ass.<br />\n<br />\n\"I hope you enjoyed that,\" she said to I--. \"I hope your animal nature is satisfied. You can get off the<br />\nfloor now.\"<br />\nplc by white<br />\nan unsuccesful transplant from Greenwich Village. There were only about 8 or<br />\n10 people around...no excuse to brush<br />\nMarcia's breast and mumble, \"Man,it's<br />\ncrowded here.\"<br />\nThe four gravitate to a corner of the<br />\nroom, where oblivious to anything else,<br />\nL--and Kelly horse around some more.<br />\nI--says nothing, glancing rapidly at<br />\nMarcia and turning away to look at the<br />\nfloor.<br />\nMarcia asks the time. It was ten.<br />\n\"Well, so long,\" waves Marcia. \"See<br />\nyou tomorrow,\" she says to Kelly.<br />\nI-- is bewildered, L--looks up, embarassed.<br />\n\"Can I walk you anywhere.\" I-- asks<br />\nher.<br />\n\"Nope. Just going over to Charles.\"<br />\n\"Where are you going? Maybe I'll<br />\ncome too.\"<br />\n\"To my boy-friend's. S'Iong.\"<br />\nI--sort of nods. Like he is saying,<br />\n\"Yup...yup...yup...\"<br />\n<br />\nIt was eleven o'clock, at some time or<br />\nother, and I--decides to cut it out with<br />\nthe cheap bitches (again, his words), and<br />\ncall P--. P-- from back home, who was<br />\nstill a senior in high school, but who he<br />\nstill really digs.<br />\nHe is glad that L--is not here. He<br />\nwouldn't have to take the phone into the<br />\nbathroom. I--does not let him forget the<br />\nti.me that I--and P-- were on the beach,<br />\nI--is watching a couple wrestle in the<br />\nsand while he vainly looks for an excuse<br />\nto pass his hand along P--'s bare midriff.<br />\nHe watches the couple enviously, trying to get up the nerve to playfully<br />\ndump P--on the blanket and horse around<br />\nwith her,<br />\nWhile she is sunning herself, he creeps<br />\nsilently in back of her. Gaily, he pokes<br />\nher in the ribs. With a wide, expectant<br />\ngrin, he waits for her to turn around and<br />\nrespond in kind. His eyes are wide with<br />\n<br />\nSomebody raps at the door. Christ,:it<br />\nwas Edgar. Edgar was a 16-year old<br />\nspade whom L--met when he tutored<br />\ndowntown. Stereotype or not. Edgar is<br />\nlike something out of Manchild. Precocious.<br />\n\"Wheah's duh man?\"<br />\nI--motions to L--'s room. He hears<br />\nthem trade their usual friendly obscneities. Edgar wants to hack around with<br />\nthe typewriter, and while he pecks, L-comes into I--'s room.<br />\n\"Think of any girl you know, and call<br />\nher,\" L--advises.<br />\n\"I don't...''<br />\n\"Hey, EDGAR...\"<br />\nOh, Christ, Christ, Christ moans I--,<br />\nleave me alone. L-asks Edgar to find I-a date. Edgar makes hiswayto the phone,<br />\ncalls the Goucher switchboard and begins<br />\nasking for girls by name.<br />\n\"Hey, baby, I wantcha to meet this<br />\nguy. You doin' anything tonite?\"<br />\nOn the ninth girl, Edgar strikes paydirt. He told her to hop a bus and haulass down to the apartment.<br />\nI--wallows in worthlessness, embarassment, tensions. He thinks of the calls<br />\nhe tried to make himself. He thinks of<br />\nAnita. She told him she was busy once.<br />\nShe told him again.<br />\nHe asked her out, maybe sarcastically,<br />\nfor a Tuesday afternoon at one. She said<br />\nshe had a date.<br />\nAnd now an inner-city spade comes to<br />\nthe rescue of an ailing white libido.<br />\nShe isn't bad. In fact, she is friendly.<br />\nL-- is safely in his room, and Edgar is<br />\npreoccupied in the ,kitchen. Sue sits on<br />\nthe bed. She is practically inviting him.<br />\nWhile they talk about things like politics,<br />\nI--watches her rack go up and downwhen<br />\nshe is vehement about some point. She<br />\nwears a sweatshirt too small for her and<br />\nwhen she moves a certain way, he sees<br />\na fleshy foldof skin.<br />\nHe is on the bed and his crotch is tingling. They are touching hands. He is burst-<br />\n<br />\ning. He leans forward, she leans back,<br />\ngoing softly down, The first time would<br />\nbe a bad one, agonizes<br />\nhad been<br />\nsuth a long time for him and he is helplessly really.<br />\n\"HEY MAN, W'AS ON DUH TUBE?\"<br />\nscreeched Edgar stomping into the room.<br />\nI--, moans, rolls to his side,faces the<br />\nwall. Sue sits and smiles at Edgar.<br />\n\"Don't turn on that, turn on the news.<br />\nI want to see if the demo at the Court<br />\nHouse is on.\"<br />\nEdgar complies. They watch the news.<br />\nThey watch the WJZ editorial. Theywatch<br />\nJose Ferrer in \"Moulin Rouge.\" They<br />\nwatch the flag salute and the prayer. Then<br />\nshe has to go home.<br />\nLater...alone...he lies in bed. He turns<br />\nout the light. He does the only honorable<br />\nthing, and does it himself.<br />\n<br />\nI--'s luck changes. He met her,(let's<br />\ncall her Carrie). He met her at a Vietnam<br />\nteach-in at Shriver Hall. She was an inch<br />\nshorter than I--and solidly built, though<br />\nnot heavy. Her face looked like it came<br />\nfrom a 1940 movie with the make-up and<br />\nall, but she was blonde and pretty.<br />\nShe had saved him from a horny madness. And she came over again...and<br />\nagain. He was satisfied. The drought had<br />\nended.<br />\nThe fourth time that Carrie is at the<br />\napartment, L--arrives with Laura and a<br />\nbottle of wine. They are in a good mood<br />\nwhich spreads to I--, but not to Carrie<br />\nwho drinks no wine. She sits good-naturedly and when someone's antics amuse<br />\nher, she laughs. But, clearly, she is not<br />\nin the mood.Soon L--and Laura disappear<br />\ninto L--\"s room.<br />\n(At this point, I--notes that a difficult<br />\nconversation follows between Carrie and<br />\nhimself. He says little, but implies that<br />\nhe ended the argument by giving in.<br />\nHe writes that he suddenly felt very tired<br />\nand used Carrie's considerable breasts<br />\nas a pillow).<br />\nL--and his broad sit in the kitchen<br />\ndrinking coffee as Carrie strides in<br />\nangrily. She snatches up her coat, scarf<br />\nand pocketbook. L--asks if anything is<br />\nwrong.<br />\n\"I don't know whether he wants a<br />\ngirl-friend or a mother.\"<br />\n<br />\nI--starts a new year at school. He<br />\nhas parted from L-- and found a new<br />\napartment. L--wanted to escape the<br />\nCalvert St. - Hopkins area which he<br />\nsaid was barren, filled with old men except for whatshername...Sugar.<br />\nI--wanted to stay. Perhaps for the<br />\nconvenience of close-by stores and the<br />\nclose-by school. He didn't really know<br />\nexactly why he wanted to stay.<br />\nHe was a year older and tried to show<br />\nit. He grew a mustache. He wasted little<br />\ntime. He arranged for Shirley to come<br />\ndown from Philadelphia often.<br />\nThen he scored with The Beautiful<br />\nGirl in the Writing Seminars, he had<br />\ncracked the barrier and landed a graduate student.<br />\nHe would come home with a'bottle of<br />\nwine and annoy his roomn -mates by flashing his big shit-eating grin on nights<br />\nBGWS was to come over. He had made<br />\nit, and walked a bit more briskly.<br />\nShe would come over, drink wine,<br />\nsmoke dope and hack around.Sometimes<br />\nthey would talk politics. Sometimes they<br />\nwould talk writing.Sometimes they would<br />\ntalk Hopkins and sometimes they would<br />\ntalk life.<br />\nFinally, they talked about her boyfriend.<br />\n<br />\nHe met a girl and fell in love with the<br />\npinkness, the sheer pubesence of her<br />\nbody. She was short and dark-haired.<br />\nThey would talk -- usually politics. The<br />\n<br />\nconversation didn't demand much and he<br />\nwas free to survey her body, think of<br />\nher almost boyish chest, her small red<br />\nmouth and her white legs.<br />\nShe was 20 but looked 15 and this excited him. Her voice was slightly nasal.<br />\nchildish. He particularly liked it when<br />\nshe wore her off-white stockings which<br />\nbrought out her essential pinkness.<br />\nHe asked her out for dinner. He dispensed with his jars of 39C pre-cooked<br />\ntamalaes and bought some steaks.<br />\nThey ate and talk more politics and<br />\nneck. (God, I-- wrote later, only I still<br />\n\"neck\").<br />\nHe calls her again but she has a<br />\n\"political\" meeting. He calls her again...<br />\nshe is rapping politics with someone else<br />\nand can't talk.<br />\nHe wonders if she is a virgin. She<br />\ncan't be, he thinks, not with her lifestyle.<br />\nHe goes to Goucher to see her. For a<br />\nwhile she seems like she is glad he came.<br />\nShe touches him a few times. They talked more politics. He watches her shoe<br />\ndangle from a pink, child-like foot. He<br />\nwatches her legs and forgot the conversation. For the second time, she repeats<br />\nthat she really has to go. He sits for a<br />\nfew minutes after she left and wondered<br />\nwhat she would do if he lured her outside and raped her.<br />\nHe goes home and goes to bed. The<br />\nbed is a scene of furious action and the<br />\nnext day he gives her up.<br />\n<br />\nHe has Shirley come down from Philadelphia the next weekend. He is bursting, he did not wish to be the old \"I--\"<br />\nof past years, he takes the situation in<br />\nhand.<br />\nHe cuts amenities short. The normal<br />\nfour-way conversation between Shirley.<br />\nand his two room -mates is averted. He<br />\ntakes her straight to the bedroom.<br />\nShirley does not particularly excite<br />\nhim. She is slightly fat and her face is<br />\nnot ugly, though not appealing. She is,<br />\nhowever, there.<br />\nHe takes a long time undressing her.<br />\nHe remains dressed<br />\n'after he has peeled<br />\nof her last piece of clothing. He fendles<br />\nher breast with his hand. He sees that her<br />\nnipples are erect and that she is past the<br />\nstopping point. He unbuttons his shirt but<br />\ndid no more to undress himself. He resumes his persistent stroking. He kisses<br />\nher between the breasts and trails his<br />\nlips down her stomach Co her thigh.<br />\nShe is breathing hard and slipps her<br />\nhands up his undershirt, along the ribs.<br />\nShe pushes the shirt over his head.<br />\nThen he feels a hand toy with his belt<br />\nbuckle. Another is in his hair. The belt<br />\nis loosened and the hand plays on the<br />\nclasp of his pants. His excitement mounts<br />\nbut he forces himself to continue his<br />\npersistent stroking and caressing. His<br />\nhand trails down her leg, around her ankle<br />\nand up again.<br />\nThe clasp of his pants is open.She toys<br />\nwith the fly and pulls it down.She reaches<br />\nIn his pants and he moves towards her.<br />\nShe stiffens. She pulls out her hand.<br />\nIt's wet.<br />\n<br />\nThe last time I saw I--, he was siting in a place I shall,not name, talking<br />\nto 5 or 6 guys. In a calm but humorous<br />\nway, he was recounting stories offailure..<br />\nstories about himself. From his audience,<br />\nit brought shrieks of hilarity; to a disinterested observer, it would have elicited<br />\na sense of pathos.<br />\nI--'s stories have since been generally circulated. He, naturally, tells them<br />\nbetter than anyone else. For this reason,<br />\nI perhaps liave done him a disservice.

Denounces 'Purpose' of Discipline Code<br />\nBy ANDY GREEN<br />\nThe New University Conference has<br />\nissued a position statement condemning<br />\nPresident Gordon's attempt to establish a discipline code for the university.<br />\nThe NUC statement claims that \"the<br />\npurpose of the Administration campaign to establish a code on student<br />\nconduct is to legitimize in advance political repression.\" The NUC accused<br />\nboth Gordon's discipline code and that<br />\nof the Student Affairs Committee of<br />\nbeing \"aimed at punishing acts of conscience said to infringe the rights of<br />\nothers.\"<br />\nThe paper goes on to criticize Gordon's definition of \"normal functioning\" of the university. The NUC claims<br />\n<br />\nDr. John S. Mann, a member of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee, has organized a faculty<br />\npetition drive in support of the SAC discipline code.<br />\n<br />\nthat \"President Gordon appears to believe that his job as chief administrator of the university is to protect normal functioning as he unilaterally defines it.\" The paper asks whether \"a<br />\nuniversity policy that has many of its<br />\nemployees working at poverty wages\"<br />\nis a \"normal function\" of the university. \"What may be normal to one man<br />\nmay be inhumane to another,\" says the<br />\nNUC.<br />\n<br />\n\"Ultimate Issue\"<br />\nThe position paper emphaske,,s that<br />\n\"the ultimate issue of governance\" must<br />\nbe dealt with before the question of student discipline can be raised. \"If we do<br />\nnot know what the university is about -what kinds of restraints its valid func-tions may require, how can we possibly<br />\n<br />\nSC Declines to Punish its Absentees<br />\nThere are no indications that any action<br />\nwill be taken against members of the<br />\nStudent Council who have broken a Constitutional clause concerning unexcused<br />\nabsences from SC meetings.<br />\nThe _clause states that any member<br />\nof the Council shall be ineligible for further participation on the SC if he misses<br />\ntwo meetings during his term in office<br />\nwithout receiving permission from the<br />\npresident. Vice President James Stewart, Treasurer John Globig,Senior class<br />\nPresident John Marron, and Junior class<br />\nPresident Greg Szoka have each received at least three unexcused absences this<br />\nyear.<br />\nAlthough SC officers have knownof the<br />\nrestriction, they have made no attempts<br />\nto enforce it. Former President of the<br />\nCouncil Russ Passarella claims that<br />\nlast year he threatened to enforce the rule<br />\nbut that when the occasion arose he failed to follow through on his warnings.<br />\nAt the start of this year, and at no<br />\nother time since September, has there<br />\n<br />\nbeen any reference to the clause by Council President John Guess. He did, however, suspend two members of Council<br />\nfrom last week's meeting in order to<br />\ngive the body a quorum for the first time<br />\nthis semester.<br />\nThe two persons temporarily deposed<br />\nwere Stewart and senior representative<br />\nChuck Fax. At that time Fax had only<br />\none unexcused absence but Stewart had<br />\naccumulated five.<br />\nNone of those who have two or more<br />\nabsences have indicated they will resign or discontinue work with the SC.<br />\nStewart works with the varsity basketball<br />\nteam and thus is prevented from attending Council meetings that are held at the<br />\n-same times as team activities.<br />\nGuess has defended Globig's absences<br />\nbecause the treasurer devotes a lot of<br />\ntime to working on the Student Activities<br />\nCommission. Guess claimed that Globig<br />\nputs in more time with the SAC than most<br />\nCouncil members devote to just the SC.<br />\nOne Council member said that both<br />\n<br />\nMarron and Szoka would work on SC<br />\nactivities if there were incentive, but<br />\nthat the body had not provided that impetus.<br />\n<br />\nSenior Chuck Fax was suspended at the last<br />\nSC meeting in order to obtain a quorum.<br />\n<br />\ndetermine what conduct should or should<br />\nnot be sanctioned?\" asks the NUC statement.<br />\nThe document states that the two discipline codes are not the only alternatives open to the university. Other alternatives suggested were a faculty conduct code, or one for the administration,<br />\nor not having any code at all.<br />\nThe position statement ends with a further emphasis on dealingwith fundamental issues: \"What is required now is a<br />\nsearching examination of the meaning of<br />\nthe university in America, what it is, and<br />\nwhat it should be.\"<br />\n<br />\n1000 Signatures<br />\nIn contrast to NUC's attitude, leaders<br />\nof the student petition campaign are<br />\nplanning a major drive this week. Jim<br />\nCleary, organizer of the campaign, said<br />\nthat the petitions would be circulated in<br />\nclasses and through the mailboxes.<br />\nCleary hopes to have a thousand signatures by the end of the week.<br />\nA similar petition campaign, organized by Dr. John S. Mann of the Education<br />\ndepartment, is also gaining momentum.<br />\nMann said that the petition was being<br />\ncirculated in almost every department.<br />\nThe few petitions that were returned,<br />\nsaid Mann,had the signatures of a \"pretty'<br />\ndecent percent\" of the members of those<br />\ndepartments. Mann stated that he hoped<br />\nto get an idea of how many signatures<br />\nhe would get by the end of this week.<br />\nThe Graduate Student Organization<br />\nwill also be sponsoring a petition drive.<br />\nThe campaign will be planned at tonight'<br />\nmeeting of the GS0 Council. GS0 President Bob Cotter will discuss reasons for<br />\nsupporting the SAC conduct code. Cotter<br />\nis planning a campaign on a more personal level than Cleary's.

Robert Roy, Dean of Engineering<br />\nScience and chairman of the committee that<br />\npresented the proposal to the Assembly, feared<br />\nsuch a reaction, and took pains in his remarks<br />\nto point out that a scholarly and rigorous program could be designed.<br />\nAnother point of dispute was the proposed<br />\n\"cognate instruction\" to \"serve non-degree students from the ranks of outside organizations.\"<br />\nSome faculty members felt that such a program<br />\ndid not belong at Hopkins.

The proposed Center<br />\nwould be primarily involved in<br />\n\"study and research at pre- and<br />\npost doctoral levels\" as well as<br />\nin faculty research.<br />\nThe need for such an institution, said the proposal, is evidenced by the numerous crises<br />\nstemming from the inadequate<br />\norganization of essential social<br />\nenterprises. There . is also a<br />\ngrowing but unsystematized body<br />\nof knowledge concerning administrative science. Thus educa4ion;systematization of existing knowledge, and further research in the field of administration would be functions of the<br />\nnew Center.<br />\nThe faculty for such an institution would be drawn from existing<br />\nUniversity<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nAdditional faculty would be recruited by each department to<br />\nwork in the Center. \"For example, a scholar interested in the<br />\nbehavior of formal organizations would be a peer colleague<br />\nin the department of Psychology<br />\nand have the additional opportunity to participate in activities<br />\nof the Center,\" the proposal stated.<br />\nGraduate and post-doctoral<br />\nfellows would be admitted to regular departments, and could<br />\nchoose whether or not they desired associationwith the Center.<br />\nThe proposal said that \"programs and degree requirements<br />\nfor students working in association with the Center would be subject to the same standards of<br />\nquality and the same governance<br />\nas other degree candidates.\"<br />\nBoth theoretical and applied<br />\nresearch would be carried on at<br />\nthe Center. The report proposed<br /><br />\nthat organizations, such as large<br />\ncorporations of the U.S. Government, might be willing to provide<br />\nfunds for research. Theoretical<br />\nstudies, said the proposal, might<br />\ninclude \"such topics as value,<br />\ndecision, organization, and control theory,\" while applied research might involve \"design of<br />\na health care or educational systerm, or a computerized information network.''<br />\nThe proposal advocated that<br />\nundergraduates take part in both<br />\ncourses and research programs<br />\nof the Center. Such participation,<br />\nsuggests the proposal, \"would<br />\nhelp to blur the undergraduategraduate student demarcation<br />\nwhich has concerned this and<br />\nother universities.\"<br />\nIn addition to graduate and undergraduate participation, the<br />\nCenter would involve a number of<br />\nnon-degree students in its cognate programs. Such programs<br />\nwould serve non-degree students<br />\nfrom the ranks of outside organizations, and bring them abreast<br />\nof developments in such fields<br />\nas computer science, operations<br />\nresearch, and other disciplines<br />\nrelated to administrative science.<br />\nThe report proposes that the<br />\nCenter be housed in a self-contained building that would cost<br />\nan estimated ten to fifteen million dollars. These funds, suggests the proposal, might be provided by a foundation grant and<br />\nby government funds. Research<br />\ngrants and contracts would provide operational funds.<br /><br />\nRetiring Mills Comments on JHU<br />\nDr. Edwin S.

When asked if disappointment with Hopkins was the<br />\ncause of the forthcoming move,<br />\nDr. Mills replied that he was<br />\n\"very happy here\" and that his<br />\nreasons for leaving did not lie in<br />\nany personal dissatisfaction with<br />\nHopkins. He added that he had<br />\nbeen offered a \"very good position\" at Princeton, a position<br />\nwhich involved a new faculty post<br />\nand which represented an advancement of his academic career.<br /><br />\nLooking Back<br />\nLooking back on his.. years at<br />\nHopkins, he gave some of his impressions of the quality of life<br />\nhere. He commented on such<br />\nmajor issues as governance,<br />\ngrowth of faculty and student bodies, and teaching of undergraduates.<br />\nOn the issue of University governance, Dr. Mills stated that it is<br />\n\"an important and complex issue\" but that there is \"no urgency\" in dealing with it. Hopkins,<br />\nsaid Dr. Mills, is \"not run ideally,\" but likewise, it has not been<br /><br />\nC.A.S. Plan Voted Down<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br /><br />\nIs a research institution? It's<br />\nnot clear what that means, but<br /><br />\nI think if it means anything it<br />\nmeans something that would be<br />\nIncompatible<br />\nwith<br />\nbusinessoriented sort of work.\"<br />\nOne dejected member of the<br />\nOperations Research Department<br />\ncommented after the proceedings<br />\nthat the attitude of the humanities<br /><br />\nfaculty and the hard scientists<br />\n(physics, chemistry, biology, as<br />\nopposed<br />\nto<br />\nengineers) was<br />\n\"sneering\" and that they reacted<br />\nnegatively without thinking any<br />\ntime the word \"business\" was<br />\nmentioned. He claimed that the<br />\nfaculty's<br />\nattitude reflected a<br />\nbasic misunderstanding of what<br />\nadministrative science consists<br />\nof.<br /><br />\ncould be adopted with Hopkins<br />\nstill remaining the smallest<br />\nmajor university in the East.

According to<br />\nDr. Mills, the size of the Political<br />\nEconomy Department's faculty<br />\nshould be increased from seven to<br />\nat least eleven or twelve members. Similar actions are necessary in every University Department to insure a large enough<br />\n\"appeal for each group\" 9f students by offering \"a large spectrum\" of academic pursuits within each area.<br /><br />\n\"confronted<br />\nwith<br />\ndisaster.\"<br />\nThus, he feels that major changes, such as would be involved<br />\nin the problem of University Governance \"should be thought about<br />\nand argued for one or two years\"<br />\nbefore any final decision is to be<br />\nAnother related problem, said<br />\nmade.<br />\nDr. Mills, is the lack of enOffering more thoughts on Hopthusiasm on the part of too much<br />\nkins, Dr. Mills labeled the Univof the Faculty for teaching at the<br />\nersity as \"a fine university,\"<br />\nundergraduate level, which seems<br />\nwhich should be proud of its<br />\nto be thought of as \"second-rate<br />\n\"smallness\" and diversity.

He stated that the Committee has not given up and will continue its<br />\nwork, as long as the President refuses to give a firm commitment for pulling out of Vietnam.<br />\nKudlow described the Committee as having been<br />\n\"relatively invisible\" for the last few months. However,<br />\nhe said that it has been working quietly to set up seven<br />\nregional offices across the country. In addition the Committee has been making plans for March and April activities.<br /><br />\nings, planned for the following week.<br />\nFor April 15 massive, nationwide tax demonstrations<br />\nare being planned. A great effort will be made to involve<br />\nmiddle and lower class adults in the antiwar cause. Kudlow<br />\nsaid that the Moratorium Committee plans a low-keyed<br />\neffort to draw critical relationships between military<br />\npolicy and economic problems, such as Nixon's HEW veto<br />\nand his requests for ABM appropriations. Moratorium<br />\nworkers will attempt to prove how the Vietnam War is<br />\nresponsible for tax hikes, inflation, the threat of recession,<br />\nand the decrease in the buying power of money.<br />\nKudlow<br />\ndeclared the Moratorium Committee to be<br />\nopposed to \"Nixon's illusion of the silent majority, not to<br />\nthe American people...I don't believe that people are<br />\nreally supporting the President.If you scratch one,quarter<br />\ninch below the surface, you'll see great frustration and rising discontent,\" he said. The Committee will try to show<br />\nthe people that \"it is Nixon and Laird who are polarizing<br />\nthe country, not us.\"<br /><br />\nCivil Disobedience<br /><br />\nAmericans Are Nonpolitical<br /><br />\nBy HOWARD LEVENSON<br /><br />\nIn March action will center around draft boards, with<br />\nrallies and vigils. Civil disobedience will be emphasized.<br />\nIt will take the form of a massive \"We Won't Go\" statement, hopefully to be released at a press conference in<br />\nWashington.<br />\nThe Committee is seeking a direct confrontation with the<br />\nSelective Service System.It hopes to organize ten thousand<br />\ndraftees to refuse induction. Kudlow said that the government would not prosecute ten thousand draft resisters.<br />\nHe said that the government is already letting draft resisters go free, citing as an example the refusal to prosecute<br />\nDavid Hawk of the Moratorium Committee.<br />\nKudlow said that ultimately he and his co-workers seek<br />\nrepeal of the draft and its replacement with a volunteer<br />\narmy. He emphasized that the Moratorium Committee has<br />\nnot decided on this course of action because of opposition<br />\nto all wars and warfare, but because of opposition to the<br />\nVietnam War.<br />\nThe statements on the draft and the volunteer army are<br />\nto be released the week of March 16, so as to coordinate<br />\nwith the anti-draft week being organized by the New<br />\nMobilization Committee for the week of March 16-23.<br />\nIn addition, it is timed to immediately precede draft hear-<br /><br />\nKudlow expressed the belief that most Americans are not<br />\npolitical people, but that they are governed by a economic<br />\nself-interest. He said that this is not all bad, because \"a<br />\ncounty with two hundred million activists would be one-dimensional.\" He attributed a great deal of the cold reception given by adults to past Moratorium activities to the<br />\nfact that people either feel very uncomfortable discussing<br />\ndissent or feel as if the Moratorium workers are wasting<br />\ntheir precious time.<br />\n\"Our leaders will have to admit that we have made a<br />\ntragic mistake,\" said Kudlow. \"I hope all of you go home<br />\nand think about the state of this country, and commit yourselves to working with us as long as the war goes on.\"<br />\nHe described the turnout, for his speech and the antiwar<br />\ndocumentary \"Vietnam: in The Year of the Pig,\" as \"encouraging.\" The event was held to benefit the Baltimore<br />\nVietnam Moratorium Committee.<br /><br />\nSpeeches At Goucher<br />\nThe film was shown again on Friday night at Goucher,<br />\naccompanied by speeches by both Kudlow and David Hawk,<br />\nNational Coordinator for the Moratorium.Kudlow again<br />\nemphasized the necessity of continuing to broaden the<br /><br />\nWant a Classified?<br />\nUse this easy to fill out form.<br />\nHEADING:<br /><br />\nEat-in, Carry-out<br /><br />\nJEN'S<br /><br />\n3121 ST.

Neither has the Student<br />\nCouncil been in the public eye, nor has it done very much<br />\nto rise to its own defense.<br />\nIn fact, the conduct of the Council in the past few<br />\nmonths has been so scandalously negligent as to raise<br />\nquestions anew about its necessity and usefulness. Not<br />\nonly has the S.C. consistently refrained from attacking the<br />\nmultifold problems of the community, but it has been slow<br />\neven to deal with questions and conflicts unearthed by the<br />\nother groups on campus. What is even more disheartening<br />\nis the fact that recent meetings have either been cancelled<br />\nor 'tampered with' due to lack of attendance.<br />\nFigures from the Council's roll book indicate that one<br />\nmember has five unexcused absences, three members have<br />\nthree nch, and eight others have one apiece. Counting<br />\nexcused absences--a process which essentially involves a<br />\npre-meeting announcement of the fact\u2014the number is substantially higher.<br />\nNone of these shortcomings and weaknesses, however,<br />\ncan compare with the S.C.'s actions of the past few days.<br />\nIn a series of virtually unparalleled moves, it went past admitting its ineffectiveness at dealing with foreign issues to<br />\nan :admission of helplessness at coping with its own constitution.<br />\nBy refusing to discipline its wayward members, the<br />\nCouncil has virtually given up any pretensions of power,<br />\nprestige or influence. It is an implicit admission to students, faculty and administration alike that nothing the<br />\ncouncil officially does need be taken seriously, since it<br />\ncannot even take the question of its own attendance seriously.<br />\nIt is clear to all that there are a number of weak and<br />\nconfusing aspects to the Council's constitution. The membership question is one of these, in that no clear procedural<br />\nmatters have been delineated by which a member is officially expelled. For the S.C. to deal with this legislatively<br />\nwould be a laudable, if not necessary, step. The fact, however, that procedure was entirely and blithely ignored lends<br />\nconsiderable doubt to the Council's ability to deal properly<br />\nand legalistically with any serious issue twhich, confronts<br />\nthat body.<br /><br />\ncG<br />\n,<br /><br />\nMlgrog,miglzaza<br />\nON 710 WALL- \u2014 Mb/5<br />\na<br /><br />\nFAIREsT OF<br />\nTNE.44 ALLT<br /><br />\ni --1, A.k<br />\niv<br /><br />\nBy A.

Not to be left out of this illustrious fraternity, Lincoln Gordon has now taken<br />\nto attacking the media.<br /><br />\nTUESDAY<br />\nday editor<br />\nmanaging editor<br /><br />\nSome of you may not have caught last Friday's<br />\nsmall, page 3, story on a News-Letter interview with Gordon. That interview took place<br />\nat 9:30 on a Monday *morning. I had been up<br />\nuntil 4:30 that morning working on the paper.<br />\nNow, I don't usually get up anywhere around<br />\n9:00 on a normal Monday, much less after only<br />\nfour hours of sleep. But there I was, standing,<br />\ntotally out-of-it, in Homewood House, little knowing that I and the two other N-L people with me<br />\nwere about to get verbally lashed for our issue<br />\nof the previous Friday. \"<br />\nSome of Gordon's juicier comments were left<br />\nout of the news article, but what he said was,<br />\nin effect, he resented our reacting so soon to his<br />\ndiscipline proposal, chastising us to \"do our<br />\nhomework before you write your next pieces on<br />\nthe matter.\" (Sounds sorta' like oP.Spiro talking<br />\nabout the bad effects of the TV men immediately<br />\ngiving their commentary on poor Dick's speech.)<br /><br />\nAd Horninum<br />\nGordon seemed especially peeved over the<br />\ncolumn which this author penned, and took full<br />\nadvantage of my presence (in body if not in<br />\nmind) to tell me so. He stated that my column<br />\ndid not deal objectively with the issues, as it<br />\n\"cheats out of arguments ad hominum.\"<br />\nWell, now, as if I didn't know it didn't deal<br />\nobjectively with the subject. Of course it didn't.<br />\nIt wasn't supposed to. Any fool could have seen<br />\nthat. Going on the assumption that the fallacies<br />\nin Gordon's discipline code were obvious to even<br />\nthe most untrained eye, the column simply attempted to throw in some of the more obvious<br />\n(and damaging) arguments against that code,<br />\nwhile dealing with the problem in its larger<br />\ncontext, all done in a hopefully entertaining<br />\nfashion.<br />\nYes, President Gordon, I had done my homework, I had read your code, and am quite familiar with the whole subject. But a step-by-step<br />\ncataloging of the logical inconsistencies in your<br />\ncode would have consumed pages of boring rhetoric, so it was decided that a newspaper column is not the place for such a thing.<br /><br />\nHill<br /><br />\nAfter all, Gordon's arguments were presented for all to read in a beautiful four page spread,<br />\nand it was not really necessary to give them<br />\nequal time in that commentary. So it was written, and so it stands.<br /><br />\nLook It Up<br />\nThe President also suggested to me that \"you<br />\nmight do well if you look up the dictionary definition of paranoia and see where the shoe really<br />\nfits.\" Well, I must admit, 1 have neglected my<br />\nduty, and will have to rely on the definition I<br />\npicked up last semester in abnormal psych.<br />\nAnd the fact that the shoe still fits so perfectly<br />\non Gordon's foot I suppose might be blamed<br />\non Dr. Shaffer for teaching me all I know about<br />\nthe subject.<br />\nBut the problem still remains about those<br />\nobjective arguments. They are so numerous<br />\nand complex that I categorically refuse, in order<br />\nto preserve my sanity and yours, to write them<br />\nout for publication. I had hoped that whatever<br />\npetition was gotten up would include them, but<br />\napparently those campus-conscious individuals<br />\nwho take care of such things ran into the same<br />\ncomplex boredom that I did. After all, God knows<br />\nthat everybody at Hopkins has been instructed<br />\nby their father figure not to sign anything they<br />\nhaven't read, and so a seventeen page petition<br />\nwouldn't get too far.<br /><br />\nA Proposition<br />\nThe only way to possibly make such things interesting would be to have some sort of public<br />\ndiscussion about them, far from the burden of<br />\nthe printed page. And, so for these reasons, I<br />\ndo hereby challange Lincoln Gordon to a debate<br />\non the discipline issue. This is for real. Out<br />\nIn the public, with constructive speeches, rebuttals, cross-examination, the whole schticke<br />\nWe could work out the working of the proposition together, but I presume that Gordon would<br />\nbe on the affirmative and I would take the negative, and, of course, you would be the judge.<br />\nSo, Mr. President, if you really aren't paranoid, think about it. If, as you claim, I haven't<br />\ndone my homework and can only use ad hominum<br />\narguments, it would be a pushover? The same<br />\nwould be true if you really weren't as arbitrary<br />\nas has been claimed. In any case, it could be<br />\nnothing more or less than a clearing of the air<br />\nabout the entire subject. So, think about it, and<br />\nif interested, please reply in care of the NewsLetter;<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\nGOVERNANCE BEFORE DISCIPLINE<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nThe dispute between Lincoln Gordon and the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee over the disciplinary<br />\ncode has raised a more vital question. While<br />\nthe community talks about which of two code,<br />\nversions is best, the conflict underlying the<br />\ndiscussion more fundamentally involves how Hopkins is to be governed.<br />\nThe New University Conference chapter at Hopkins believes a much fuller discussion of these<br />\nissues by the university as a whole is required.<br />\nTo consider the issue of conduct apart from that<br />\nof governance is nonsenical.

Ubu! Ubu Roil<br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nAn answer to the inevitable what to do this weekend<br />\nquestion. For one of the next two weekends, anyway.<br />\nNot a movie, as every film in tewn is either rated G<br />\nor is one that you saw in New York two months ago. A<br />\nPlay.<br />\nFor those of you who missed the microscopic posters, Theatre Hopkins is currently presenting Alfred<br />\nJarry's Ubu Roi in the Barn Theatre. First produced<br />\nin 1896, causing literal and literary riots, this seminal<br />\nwork has been of unquestionably significant influence in<br />\nthe history of modern theatre.<br />\nAs a first crack in the<br />\nwalls of Hugo-Zola realism and late Victorianism, Ubu<br />\nRol spawned the Gallic madness<br />\nof Dada and Surrealism<br />\nand the absurdity of Beckett<br />\nand Ionesco which we still<br />\nadmire to srespectfully today.<br />\nPerhaps this is the only value of Ubu Rol, as a piece<br />\nof historical<br />\ninterest rather than literary merit. The<br />\navant-garde of 1896 bears little surprise for today's<br />\nplaywatcher -- note the relative calm with which Grotowsky's revolutionary Polish Laboratory Theatre was<br />\nreceived. Attending Jarry's play is almost analagous<br />\nto those<br />\nintolerable semesters of survey courses and<br />\nprerequisites (you know, the \"necessary background\"<br />\nbullshit.) It would be analagous if Ubu Rol were not<br />\nentertaining.<br /><br />\nGarbled Green Candles<br />\nA puppeteer opens the play by manipulating some marionnettes while crossing and re-crossing the stage, muttering something barely discernable (very poor enunciation) about a green candle. Later on another character<br />\nSpeaks of a green candle, but his lines were garbled and<br />\nunintelligible also. So much for the symbolism of green<br /><br />\ncandles.<br />\nThen the two main characters, Mere and Pere Ubu,<br />\nappear. Captain of the Dragoons and a former king of<br />\nAragon, Pere Ubu \u201e; is a crude slob who is persuaded by<br />\nhis wife to murder the reigning king of Poland and assume<br />\nthe throne. ,(Jarry wrote, \"As for the action - that takes<br />\nplace in Poland - that is to say - nowhere.\") The Ubus'<br />\nconspiracy succeeds, assasinating- all but the moronic<br />\nprince Bougrelas. An oppressive totalitarianism is<br />\nestablished, imposing exorbitant taxes and executing all<br />\nthe notiles, magistrates, and financiers.<br />\nPere Ubu's lust for money and blood can be restrained<br />\nonly by his dominating trait, cowardice. He becomes<br />\nhelpless with fear at the thought of Bougrelas,the legitimate heir sworn to vengenace in a scene which amateurishly parodies the' ghost scene in Hamlet.<br /><br />\nSea-Sick Sailors<br />\nWhen one of Pere Ubu's fellow conspirators turns against him, war results. His gaudy ostentation waving<br />\nin the breeze, Pere Ubu gallops off to smashing defeat,<br />\nthough it is not. clear whether anyone has won. Pere<br />\nUbu, his wife, and their loyal flunkies end up sea sick<br />\nand alone on a ship, until an actor displays a sign<br />\nreading \"End\". (This play concludes in a manner<br />\nstrikingly similar to Ingmar Bergman's recent Shame.)<br />\nAlthough an important milestone in the twentieth century's attack on reason and order, Ubu Rol seems quaintly mild today. Jarry's humor is concentrated in the use<br />\nof broad slapstick and grotesque shifts of action and<br />\nmood. Theatre Hopkins has augmented the script with<br />\nmany humorous touches: corpses which flutter their<br />\narms and float off stage like angles, a messenger who<br />\nleaps on stage and freezes in the one-point stance of<br /><br />\nMercury. The dialogue, though witty in spots, is mostly on a par with a Three Stooges short (which is not<br />\nto say that it is bad, but...)<br />\nJarry's battle against meaning does show in the total<br />\nunreality of his exaggerated characters and events. All<br />\nthe conventional \"themes\" which the play seems to relate -- war and greed are bad,crime does not pay, etc. -are so overwhelmed by the absurdity that they are ridiculed into non-existence.<br /><br />\nAdded Devices Distracting<br />\nUnfortunately, Jarry's original script has been expanded by some superfluous and confusing devices. The puppeteer at the opening of the play and the prominent<br />\nprescence of four large dice as part of the set immediately suggests fate, chance, life is a game, man is manipulated by Unknown Powers, etc., etc. These are ideas<br />\nwhich do not appear in the dialogue or action at all.<br />\nTheatre Hopkins' choice of props was wise - birdcages<br />\nfor royal crowns, a dust shovel for Pere Ubu's sceptre<br />\nof power, and a curved cane (Pere Ubu calls it his \"shitter\") employed alternately as a sword, whip, and telescope. Much is added by the imaginative costuming:<br />\nPere Ubu is bloated to the proportions of three Santa<br />\nClauses, his wife appears with lewdly gargantuan .bust<br />\nand buttocks.<br />\nA word on the acting. The characters are flat unidimensional silhouettes and should be played that way.<br />\nDonald Hart does just that in the role of Pere Ubu. Mere<br />\nUbu is done by Ruth Lawson Walsh, who adds an enjoyable amount of coarse spirit and boisterousness to her<br />\npart. ,And the role of Captain Bordure acquires comic<br />\nelements totally independent of Jarry's words, due to<br />\nJoe Bandiera's hilarious diction.<br /><br />\nigarren Calvert St.,0 Barren People<br />\nBy BRUCE DRAKE<br />\nUnder a stack of shoddy-looking<br />\nPapers -- on top, two old notices of<br />\nClassification, a student telephone directory, and some notes on Cell Biology -Ifound what follows.<br />\nYou may ask why.it belongs in a<br />\nnewspaper, and I'm not sure.

He rallies himself and tries<br />\nto finish up something for the Writing<br />\nSeminar. He gives up and fingers his<br />\ncell bio text. (Why in hell did I take<br />\nthat? He thinks).<br />\nHe goes to bed.<br /><br />\nI--checks his post office box in Gilman Hall. He looks at the blonde -nearly white-haired -- teller at the bank.<br />\nHe looks at her (so he writes) because<br />\nshe has a decent face, she is a slim<br />\ncut above the general mediocrity of female looks on campus.<br />\nHe walks out on the quad and heads<br />\nto the library. A bearded graduate student passes with two girls. He studies<br />\nthem and recognizes one as an employee and the other as an another graduate student.<br />\nHe undresses the graduate student in<br />\nhis mind...the one with the long, brown<br />\nhair. The results are as before: smooth<br />\nskin, soft little breasts and a tongue<br />\nwhich never failed to excite him since<br />\nhe saw her licking an ice cream cone in<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nThe results are the same because he<br />\nhad catalogued her in his fantasies before. Three years ago in high school, he<br />\nwould have thought her only fair-looking.<br />\nNow he would do anything to secure her.<br />\nIt is Wednesday and Goucher students<br /><br />\nroam through the library.

At the desk is the girl (woman? he<br />\nasks) who always sits there. He doesn't<br />\nknow whether she is a grad student or<br />\njust an employee. She is tall, taller than<br />\nI---who was nearly 6 feet. She is not<br />\nclassically beautiful, though her cheekbones are high and sharply-structured.<br />\nShe is not that appealing, even as an<br />\nearth-mother. But he looks anyway.<br /><br />\nI--is ecstatic. From Goucher, and this<br />\ngirl obviously has class.

It demands new energy, but reflecting on the<br />\ncourse of the last semester, I-- could<br />\nnot muster it. It would have to improve.<br />\nI--goes, in his despair, to a fraternity rush party. He preserves his pride<br />\nby rationalizing that he has come to get<br />\nwhat he wants and can forget the rest of<br />\nthe oppressive atmosphere.

A good<br />\nlooking girl. An exciting girl. What is<br />\nmore, an 18-year-old -or-even-older<br />\ngirl. Let us call her Marcia.<br />\nHe doesn't know how, but he asks her<br />\nto dance. He tries to be witty as he shuffles his feet around, but he also tries<br />\nto make her understand he is deep, sensitive. He scans the room surreptiously,<br />\nsuspecting that Marcia came with one of<br />\nthe brothers and she is only frat bait.<br />\nShe didn't dance, I--was to write later,<br />\nshe writhed. The room was dark and he<br />\nput his hand in hi's, pocket quickly squeezed, and removed it. What a piece, he<br />\nthinks.<br />\nHis hopes are high. She sits with him<br />\nwhen the music ends and they talk some<br />\nmore. I--parries her remarks, deftly<br />\nas he surveys her body.

You doin' anything tonite?\"<br />\nOn the ninth girl, Edgar strikes paydirt. He told her to hop a bus and haulass down to the apartment.<br />\nI--wallows in worthlessness, embarassment, tensions. He thinks of the calls<br />\nhe tried to make himself. He thinks of<br />\nAnita. She told him she was busy once.<br />\nShe told him again.<br />\nHe asked her out, maybe sarcastically,<br />\nfor a Tuesday afternoon at one. She said<br />\nshe had a date.<br />\nAnd now an inner-city spade comes to<br />\nthe rescue of an ailing white libido.<br />\nShe isn't bad. In fact, she is friendly.<br />\nL-- is safely in his room, and Edgar is<br />\npreoccupied in the ,kitchen. Sue sits on<br />\nthe bed. She is practically inviting him.<br />\nWhile they talk about things like politics,<br />\nI--watches her rack go up and downwhen<br />\nshe is vehement about some point. She<br />\nwears a sweatshirt too small for her and<br />\nwhen she moves a certain way, he sees<br />\na fleshy foldof skin.<br />\nHe is on the bed and his crotch is tingling. They are touching hands. He is burst-<br /><br />\ning. He leans forward, she leans back,<br />\ngoing softly down, The first time would<br />\nbe a bad one, agonizes<br />\nhad been<br />\nsuth a long time for him and he is helplessly really.<br />\n\"HEY MAN, W'AS ON DUH TUBE?\"<br />\nscreeched Edgar stomping into the room.<br />\nI--, moans, rolls to his side,faces the<br />\nwall. Sue sits and smiles at Edgar.<br />\n\"Don't turn on that, turn on the news.<br />\nI want to see if the demo at the Court<br />\nHouse is on.\"<br />\nEdgar complies. They watch the news.<br />\nThey watch the WJZ editorial. Theywatch<br />\nJose Ferrer in \"Moulin Rouge.\" They<br />\nwatch the flag salute and the prayer. Then<br />\nshe has to go home.<br />\nLater...alone...he lies in bed. He turns<br />\nout the light. He does the only honorable<br />\nthing, and does it himself.<br /><br />\nI--'s luck changes. He met her,(let's<br />\ncall her Carrie). He met her at a Vietnam<br />\nteach-in at Shriver Hall. She was an inch<br />\nshorter than I--and solidly built, though<br />\nnot heavy. Her face looked like it came<br />\nfrom a 1940 movie with the make-up and<br />\nall, but she was blonde and pretty.<br />\nShe had saved him from a horny madness. And she came over again...and<br />\nagain. He was satisfied. The drought had<br />\nended.<br />\nThe fourth time that Carrie is at the<br />\napartment, L--arrives with Laura and a<br />\nbottle of wine. They are in a good mood<br />\nwhich spreads to I--, but not to Carrie<br />\nwho drinks no wine. She sits good-naturedly and when someone's antics amuse<br />\nher, she laughs. But, clearly, she is not<br />\nin the mood.Soon L--and Laura disappear<br />\ninto L--\"s room.<br />\n(At this point, I--notes that a difficult<br />\nconversation follows between Carrie and<br />\nhimself. He says little, but implies that<br />\nhe ended the argument by giving in.<br />\nHe writes that he suddenly felt very tired<br />\nand used Carrie's considerable breasts<br />\nas a pillow).<br />\nL--and his broad sit in the kitchen<br />\ndrinking coffee as Carrie strides in<br />\nangrily. She snatches up her coat, scarf<br />\nand pocketbook. L--asks if anything is<br />\nwrong.<br />\n\"I don't know whether he wants a<br />\ngirl-friend or a mother.\"<br /><br />\nI--starts a new year at school. He<br />\nhas parted from L-- and found a new<br />\napartment. L--wanted to escape the<br />\nCalvert St. - Hopkins area which he<br />\nsaid was barren, filled with old men except for whatshername...Sugar.<br />\nI--wanted to stay. Perhaps for the<br />\nconvenience of close-by stores and the<br />\nclose-by school. He didn't really know<br />\nexactly why he wanted to stay.<br />\nHe was a year older and tried to show<br />\nit. He grew a mustache. He wasted little<br />\ntime. He arranged for Shirley to come<br />\ndown from Philadelphia often.<br />\nThen he scored with The Beautiful<br />\nGirl in the Writing Seminars, he had<br />\ncracked the barrier and landed a graduate student.<br />\nHe would come home with a'bottle of<br />\nwine and annoy his roomn -mates by flashing his big shit-eating grin on nights<br />\nBGWS was to come over. He had made<br />\nit, and walked a bit more briskly.<br />\nShe would come over, drink wine,<br />\nsmoke dope and hack around.Sometimes<br />\nthey would talk politics. Sometimes they<br />\nwould talk writing.Sometimes they would<br />\ntalk Hopkins and sometimes they would<br />\ntalk life.<br />\nFinally, they talked about her boyfriend.<br /><br />\nHe met a girl and fell in love with the<br />\npinkness, the sheer pubesence of her<br />\nbody. She was short and dark-haired.<br />\nThey would talk -- usually politics. The<br /><br />\nconversation didn't demand much and he<br />\nwas free to survey her body, think of<br />\nher almost boyish chest, her small red<br />\nmouth and her white legs.<br />\nShe was 20 but looked 15 and this excited him. Her voice was slightly nasal.<br />\nchildish. He particularly liked it when<br />\nshe wore her off-white stockings which<br />\nbrought out her essential pinkness.<br />\nHe asked her out for dinner. He dispensed with his jars of 39C pre-cooked<br />\ntamalaes and bought some steaks.<br />\nThey ate and talk more politics and<br />\nneck. (God, I-- wrote later, only I still<br />\n\"neck\").<br />\nHe calls her again but she has a<br />\n\"political\" meeting. He calls her again...<br />\nshe is rapping politics with someone else<br />\nand can't talk.<br />\nHe wonders if she is a virgin. She<br />\ncan't be, he thinks, not with her lifestyle.<br />\nHe goes to Goucher to see her. For a<br />\nwhile she seems like she is glad he came.<br />\nShe touches him a few times. They talked more politics. He watches her shoe<br />\ndangle from a pink, child-like foot. He<br />\nwatches her legs and forgot the conversation. For the second time, she repeats<br />\nthat she really has to go. He sits for a<br />\nfew minutes after she left and wondered<br />\nwhat she would do if he lured her outside and raped her.<br />\nHe goes home and goes to bed. The<br />\nbed is a scene of furious action and the<br />\nnext day he gives her up.<br /><br />\nHe has Shirley come down from Philadelphia the next weekend. He is bursting, he did not wish to be the old \"I--\"<br />\nof past years, he takes the situation in<br />\nhand.<br />\nHe cuts amenities short. The normal<br />\nfour-way conversation between Shirley.<br />\nand his two room -mates is averted. He<br />\ntakes her straight to the bedroom.<br />\nShirley does not particularly excite<br />\nhim. She is slightly fat and her face is<br />\nnot ugly, though not appealing. She is,<br />\nhowever, there.<br />\nHe takes a long time undressing her.<br />\nHe remains dressed<br />\n'after he has peeled<br />\nof her last piece of clothing. He fendles<br />\nher breast with his hand. He sees that her<br />\nnipples are erect and that she is past the<br />\nstopping point. He unbuttons his shirt but<br />\ndid no more to undress himself. He resumes his persistent stroking. He kisses<br />\nher between the breasts and trails his<br />\nlips down her stomach Co her thigh.<br />\nShe is breathing hard and slipps her<br />\nhands up his undershirt, along the ribs.<br />\nShe pushes the shirt over his head.<br />\nThen he feels a hand toy with his belt<br />\nbuckle. Another is in his hair. The belt<br />\nis loosened and the hand plays on the<br />\nclasp of his pants. His excitement mounts<br />\nbut he forces himself to continue his<br />\npersistent stroking and caressing. His<br />\nhand trails down her leg, around her ankle<br />\nand up again.<br />\nThe clasp of his pants is open.She toys<br />\nwith the fly and pulls it down.She reaches<br />\nIn his pants and he moves towards her.<br />\nShe stiffens. She pulls out her hand.<br />\nIt's wet.<br /><br />\nThe last time I saw I--, he was siting in a place I shall,not name, talking<br />\nto 5 or 6 guys. In a calm but humorous<br />\nway, he was recounting stories offailure..<br />\nstories about himself. From his audience,<br />\nit brought shrieks of hilarity; to a disinterested observer, it would have elicited<br />\na sense of pathos.<br />\nI--'s stories have since been generally circulated. He, naturally, tells them<br />\nbetter than anyone else. For this reason,<br />\nI perhaps liave done him a disservice.

Denounces 'Purpose' of Discipline Code<br />\nBy ANDY GREEN<br />\nThe New University Conference has<br />\nissued a position statement condemning<br />\nPresident Gordon's attempt to establish a discipline code for the university.<br />\nThe NUC statement claims that \"the<br />\npurpose of the Administration campaign to establish a code on student<br />\nconduct is to legitimize in advance political repression.\" The NUC accused<br />\nboth Gordon's discipline code and that<br />\nof the Student Affairs Committee of<br />\nbeing \"aimed at punishing acts of conscience said to infringe the rights of<br />\nothers.\"<br />\nThe paper goes on to criticize Gordon's definition of \"normal functioning\" of the university. The NUC claims<br /><br />\nDr. John S. Mann, a member of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee, has organized a faculty<br />\npetition drive in support of the SAC discipline code.<br /><br />\nthat \"President Gordon appears to believe that his job as chief administrator of the university is to protect normal functioning as he unilaterally defines it.\" The paper asks whether \"a<br />\nuniversity policy that has many of its<br />\nemployees working at poverty wages\"<br />\nis a \"normal function\" of the university. \"What may be normal to one man<br />\nmay be inhumane to another,\" says the<br />\nNUC.<br /><br />\n\"Ultimate Issue\"<br />\nThe position paper emphaske,,s that<br />\n\"the ultimate issue of governance\" must<br />\nbe dealt with before the question of student discipline can be raised. \"If we do<br />\nnot know what the university is about -what kinds of restraints its valid func-tions may require, how can we possibly<br /><br />\nSC Declines to Punish its Absentees<br />\nThere are no indications that any action<br />\nwill be taken against members of the<br />\nStudent Council who have broken a Constitutional clause concerning unexcused<br />\nabsences from SC meetings.<br />\nThe _clause states that any member<br />\nof the Council shall be ineligible for further participation on the SC if he misses<br />\ntwo meetings during his term in office<br />\nwithout receiving permission from the<br />\npresident. Vice President James Stewart, Treasurer John Globig,Senior class<br />\nPresident John Marron, and Junior class<br />\nPresident Greg Szoka have each received at least three unexcused absences this<br />\nyear.<br />\nAlthough SC officers have knownof the<br />\nrestriction, they have made no attempts<br />\nto enforce it. Former President of the<br />\nCouncil Russ Passarella claims that<br />\nlast year he threatened to enforce the rule<br />\nbut that when the occasion arose he failed to follow through on his warnings.<br />\nAt the start of this year, and at no<br />\nother time since September, has there<br /><br />\nbeen any reference to the clause by Council President John Guess. He did, however, suspend two members of Council<br />\nfrom last week's meeting in order to<br />\ngive the body a quorum for the first time<br />\nthis semester.<br />\nThe two persons temporarily deposed<br />\nwere Stewart and senior representative<br />\nChuck Fax. At that time Fax had only<br />\none unexcused absence but Stewart had<br />\naccumulated five.<br />\nNone of those who have two or more<br />\nabsences have indicated they will resign or discontinue work with the SC.<br />\nStewart works with the varsity basketball<br />\nteam and thus is prevented from attending Council meetings that are held at the<br />\n-same times as team activities.<br />\nGuess has defended Globig's absences<br />\nbecause the treasurer devotes a lot of<br />\ntime to working on the Student Activities<br />\nCommission. Guess claimed that Globig<br />\nputs in more time with the SAC than most<br />\nCouncil members devote to just the SC.<br />\nOne Council member said that both<br /><br />\nMarron and Szoka would work on SC<br />\nactivities if there were incentive, but<br />\nthat the body had not provided that impetus.<br /><br />\nSenior Chuck Fax was suspended at the last<br />\nSC meeting in order to obtain a quorum.<br /><br />\ndetermine what conduct should or should<br />\nnot be sanctioned?\" asks the NUC statement.<br />\nThe document states that the two discipline codes are not the only alternatives open to the university. Other alternatives suggested were a faculty conduct code, or one for the administration,<br />\nor not having any code at all.<br />\nThe position statement ends with a further emphasis on dealingwith fundamental issues: \"What is required now is a<br />\nsearching examination of the meaning of<br />\nthe university in America, what it is, and<br />\nwhat it should be.\"<br /><br />\n1000 Signatures<br />\nIn contrast to NUC's attitude, leaders<br />\nof the student petition campaign are<br />\nplanning a major drive this week. Jim<br />\nCleary, organizer of the campaign, said<br />\nthat the petitions would be circulated in<br />\nclasses and through the mailboxes.<br />\nCleary hopes to have a thousand signatures by the end of the week.<br />\nA similar petition campaign, organized by Dr. John S. Mann of the Education<br />\ndepartment, is also gaining momentum.<br />\nMann said that the petition was being<br />\ncirculated in almost every department.<br />\nThe few petitions that were returned,<br />\nsaid Mann,had the signatures of a \"pretty'<br />\ndecent percent\" of the members of those<br />\ndepartments. Mann stated that he hoped<br />\nto get an idea of how many signatures<br />\nhe would get by the end of this week.<br />\nThe Graduate Student Organization<br />\nwill also be sponsoring a petition drive.<br />\nThe campaign will be planned at tonight'<br />\nmeeting of the GS0 Council. GS0 President Bob Cotter will discuss reasons for<br />\nsupporting the SAC conduct code. Cotter<br />\nis planning a campaign on a more personal level than Cleary's. He hopes to<br />\nconvince graduate students of the merits<br />\nof the SAC proposals.<br /><br />\nYou are cordially invited<br />\nto attend the Commemoration Day Ceremony<br />\nin celebration of<br />\nthe Ninety-Fourth Anniversary<br />\nof the Founding of the University<br />\nMonday, February 23, 1970 at 2:30 p.m.<br />\nShriver Hall Auditorium, Homewood Campus<br />\nPanel discussion on<br /><br />\n'The University in the Nation's Service'<br />\nwith<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTHE HONORABLE ROBERT FINCH<br />\nUnited<br /><br />\nStates<br /><br />\nSecretary<br /><br />\nof<br /><br />\nHealth, Education<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\nWelfare<br /><br />\nDOCTOR ANDREW CORDIER<br />\nPresident<br /><br />\nof<br /><br />\nColumbia<br /><br />\nUniversity<br /><br />\nDOCTOR KENNETH B.
