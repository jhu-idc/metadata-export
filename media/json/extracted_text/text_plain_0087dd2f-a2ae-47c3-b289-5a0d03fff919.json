KEYES' RESIGNATION<br />\nThe resignation of Norman Chase Keyes as graduate manager<br />\nof athletics is cause for comment. We cannot help but welcome<br />\nMr.<br />\nthe action, because we feel that whatever anyone's opinion of<br />\nof<br />\nmanager<br />\ngraduate<br />\nof<br />\nion<br />\n.posit<br />\nthe<br />\nKeyes personally might be,<br />\ndone<br />\nbeen<br />\nhas<br />\nthat<br />\nwork<br />\nThe<br />\nathletics has become superfluous.<br />\nby Mr. Keyes in the past can easily be handled through the cooperative action of the Director of Athletics, the student managers, and<br />\nthe treasurer's office.<br />\nRumor has it that no one will be appointed to fill the position<br />\nnext year, assuming of course, the foregone conclusion of the acceptance of the resignation by the Athletic Council. The making<br />\nof schedules can easily be carried out by undergraduate managers<br />\nwith the advice of the coaches. The financial details of the athletic association could readily be handled by the treasurer of. the<br />\nassociation in conjunction with the treasurer of the University.<br />\nAthletic publicity can be arranged by the Director of Athletics.<br />\nAll of the duties that have fallen to the graduate manager can,<br />\nas has been shown, be subdivided among other individuals, allowing the salary of the graduate manager to be allocated to the purchasing of additional athletic equipment. We believe that everyone concerned will benefit by Mr. Keyes' resignation.<br />\n<br />\nTH E APPOINTMENT OF DR. MILES<br />\nThe appointment of Dr. L. Wardlaw Miles to the English<br />\nfaculty will be viewed with a good deal of satisfaction by those<br />\nwho know Dr. Miles either personally or through his writings<br />\nand lectures. He seems to be a man who combines a thorough<br />\nknowledge and ardent love of his subject with a sympathetic<br />\nunderstanding of those whom he is teaching. His work at the Gilman Country School was of the highest order and has marked him<br />\nas being peculiarly fitted for the position he will fill at this University next year.<br />\n<br />\nWELCOME, NAVY<br />\nIf one can be welcomed with the wish that he goes home sad<br />\nand down-hearted, we welcome Navy. Hopkins-Navy lacrosse<br />\ngames have been classics of the sport for the past three or fur<br />\nyears, and this year promises to climax a brilliant series of contests. That we will beat Navy, the NEWS-LETTER feels is more<br />\nthan a possibility: we believe that the team is equal to the task.<br />\nAt any rate, we welcome the Navy most heartily.<br />\n<br />\nJUST A STAGE KISS<br />\nBy EVANS RODGERS<br />\nentitled to a little recreation !\" Oscar<br />\na<br />\nall,<br />\nman's<br />\nit<br />\n\"Damn<br />\ngrowled. Oscar had been arguing with Agatha, his wife. Of<br />\ncourse, it was on the same, age-old subject\u2014would she never let<br />\nhim alone in his pet avocation! Amateur theatricals were not, as<br />\nshe continually told him, merely a beautiful opportunity for conceited asses to strut their vanity at the unwilling expense of their<br />\nfriends' time. His hobby was artistic in a way. And then too,<br />\nthe other fellows had their recreations: golf, tennis, insipid bridge,<br />\nand perfectly worthless canceled stamps! By God, he'd have his!<br />\n\"Oscar !\" came a voice from across the hall. It was spoken<br />\nin a tone suggestive of the individual he had just sworn by, but<br />\nOscar was determined. \"What!\" he bellowed back. \"Come here!\"<br />\nand he stuck to his<br />\ns<br />\nOscar wilted visibly, but the door was .hut<br />\nguns. \"You come here,\" he ventured, but it was softer enough<br />\nfor her to know. Agatha decided to cry: that was much the<br />\nquickest way. Oscar was always nice to her when she cried,<br />\nalthough she never quite knew why\u2014she thought it disgusting.<br />\nSo she opened the door very slowly and entered martyr-like, instead of blustering in like the tigress she was.<br />\n\"Oscar,\" she said with a timely sob, \"don't you really feel<br />\nanything when you kiss that awful leading lady ?\" \"Don't be asinine!\" Evidently Oscar was madder than usual. \"I feel her lips<br />\non mine, of course.\" \"But, dear, I mean it doesn't mean anything<br />\nat all?\"<br />\nBy jacks, Agatha was pretty. And here she was crying\u2014the<br />\ndear! He slipped his arm around her; and Agatha quickly got her<br />\nhead on his chest, her eyes and mouth out of sight. \"Darling,\" he<br />\nwent on softly, pitching his voice down two tones to where Mr.<br />\nGegotensky had told him his most seducing sounds were, \"a moment before I kiss her I tear up a letter, a moment after I light a<br />\ncigarette. All three of these are merely stage business\u2014that's all.<br />\nEach one is as important as the other two, and all three most pleasant when I do them well. (Pretty nicely said, Oscar thought,<br />\nsome day he'd have to write something too.) But can't you understand?\" \"And it doesn't mean a thing ?\" \"Not a thing!\" he answered, and he knew he was taking the right attitude, the professional attitude.<br />\n<br />\nWell, the play was over at last. Oscar sighed a little. Now<br />\nhe'd have to get down to business, he'd had his fun and now to<br />\nwork. Of course, it had been fun. His friends were all very kind<br />\nafter his performance, and although he would surely discount some<br />\nof the more obvious flattery, these people knew what they were<br />\ntalking about all right. And he wasn't such a fool as to call himself conceited when he knew he had done a good thing. No, no,<br />\nthat type was the worst of all\u2014inferiority complexes, afraid to be<br />\nfrank about their good qualities. And then he had had some quite<br />\nsensible adverse criticism too. For instance, the fellow who said<br />\nhis leading lady hadn't given him all the reactions she might have,<br />\nand the one who saw immediately that the play itself had held back<br />\nso many of his most attractive little touches.<br />\nBut now that was all over. Yes, yes, he'd rave to get back to<br />\nthe grind now, and make up for some of those long hours of rehearsing. Besides, it would please Agatha so if he quit for a while.<br />\nYes, he'd have to tell the Spielshoppers that he simply couldn't<br />\nkeep his promise about that new play of theirs. He had told them<br />\nthat as soon as this other one was over, he'd come to them, but a<br />\nman couldn't waste all his time on his recreation! The world was<br />\ntoo much with him for that! They had been rehearsing two weeks<br />\nwithout him with an understudy, but\u2014well, let the other fellow<br />\nhave a shot at a part. Sure, that was it. The Spielshoppers needed<br />\nsome young blood anyway. And then, too, he was very busy, very<br />\nbusy. Yes, there was the answer; he'd go right over and let them<br />\nbeg all they pleased; he just wouldn't do it. And he'd come back<br />\nto Agatha immediately.<br />\nThe stage manager of the Spielshoppers met him at the door<br />\nof the little theater. In a moment they were inside. \"Here you<br />\nare, Oscar,\" he was saying proudly, \"your leading lady, Miss<br />\nKeener.\" It didn't take Oscar a second to grasp the whole situation. The large brown eyes, the perfect little nose, the luscious<br />\nmouth, the skin as clear as crystal and as smooth as velvet.<br />\n\"You know, I just couldn't wait to get over to this play of<br />\nyours!\" Oscar announced confidentially. \"Damn glad that other<br />\nthing is over---it was such a farce! How have you managed with<br />\nthe understudy? Pretty bad, eh? . . . No? What? Oh!.<br />\nWell, let's get started by all means!\"<br />\nNo, no, Agatha, not a thing, not a thing!<br />\n<br />\nString Suits<br />\nTopcoats<br />\n<br />\nPriced<br />\n<br />\n$35 up<br />\n<br />\nHYMAN W.

The<br />\nspirit of its founders was transmitted<br />\nto the successors and today the College looks with just pride upon its<br />\ntraditional spirit as well as upon its<br />\nachievements.

His career<br />\nsince then has been punctuated<br />\nwith solid accomplishments.<br />\nBy the end of his fourth year<br />\nhere he had completed a thesis<br />\nfor his E.

Upon his return he<br />\nentered commercial work and<br />\nwas assigned to the Pittsburgh<br />\nterritory \u2014 (including such industrial centers as Cleveland,<br />\nYoungstown, Pittsburgh)\u2014 as<br />\nspecialist responsible for the<br />\nsales, service, and operation of<br />\nwatthour meters, instruments,<br />\nand relays in this important district.

H. FURST CO.<br />\nPrinters of<br />\nPHILOLOGICAL & SCIENTIFIC<br />\nPUBLICATIONS<br />\n23 S. Hanover St., Baltimore<br />\nBlood and something akin to thunder, heightened by bold<br />\nstage settings of red and black, provided novel entertainment at<br />\nthe Playshop Theater Monday night in the forni of a fiery Spanish<br />\nmelodrama.<br />\nThe play is \"The Great Galeoto,\" by Jose Echagaray, considered the best work of the playwright. It represents another addition to the list of national dramas presented by the Hopkins little<br />\ntheater group this season.<br />\nRepeated curtain calls at the end of each act and almost unanimous applause during the progress of the play gave evidence of<br />\nthe sympathetic reception accorded the efforts of the Playshoppers<br />\nby the most demonstrative audience of the year. \u2022<br />\nIt was the spirit and ability of the principals in the cast that<br />\ncarried off successfully what was undoubtedly a very difficult and,<br />\nat times, bloody task. For the play itself is of that highly emotional type which fairly boils with the struggle of the fiercer passions and which employs diction that is sometimes too rhetorical<br />\nto be convincing. It takes good acting, in this cynical age, to keep<br />\nsuch a play from being laughed at.<br />\nThe play was much improved, in the modern sense, according to the Play-shop management, by judicious cutting and revising of long soliloquies and asides, \"naturalizing the florid artificial<br />\ndiction and subduing to some slight extent the interpretation.\"<br />\nJealousy, inflamed by false gossip, is the driving force of the<br />\ndrama. Don Julian, a wealthy elderly Spanish gentleman, ot upright character, is happily married to a pretty young girl of twenty,<br />\nwho loves him deeply. Living with them is an impulsive young<br />\nman whom Don Julian has befriended. People begin to talk maliciously of the really blameless relations between the two young<br />\npeople. This gossip, broadcast by chronic scandal-mongers, among<br />\nwhom is Don Julian's brother, comes finally to the ears of the husband and the insidious poison, working in him, results in bloodshed<br />\nand tragedy.<br />\nElise Cohen, as Julian's wife carries off this very exacting<br />\nrole without any awkwardness at all. Although she is not quite<br />\nequal to several of the boiling points of emotion in the play,<br />\nshe displays throughout a grace and poise and variety of expression that at once attract and hold attention.<br />\nEvans Rodgers, of Barnstormers fame, in the part of the<br />\nfiery young Spaniard, has appearance against him. He has to<br />\nact against the handicap of not looking like a poet-lover-swordsman of the romantic Ramon Navarro type which the part seems<br />\nto call for. This, of course, is purely a matter of nationality or<br />\nmake-up, for Rodgers certainly gets all the necessary steam behind.<br />\nthe role and he really acts\u2014there are no mistaking the particular<br />\nshades of emotion he wants to get across.<br />\nR.

Amateur theatricals were not, as<br />\nshe continually told him, merely a beautiful opportunity for conceited asses to strut their vanity at the unwilling expense of their<br />\nfriends' time. His hobby was artistic in a way. And then too,<br />\nthe other fellows had their recreations: golf, tennis, insipid bridge,<br />\nand perfectly worthless canceled stamps! By God, he'd have his!<br />\n\"Oscar !\" came a voice from across the hall. It was spoken<br />\nin a tone suggestive of the individual he had just sworn by, but<br />\nOscar was determined. \"What!\" he bellowed back. \"Come here!\"<br />\nand he stuck to his<br />\ns<br />\nOscar wilted visibly, but the door was .hut<br />\nguns. \"You come here,\" he ventured, but it was softer enough<br />\nfor her to know. Agatha decided to cry: that was much the<br />\nquickest way. Oscar was always nice to her when she cried,<br />\nalthough she never quite knew why\u2014she thought it disgusting.<br />\nSo she opened the door very slowly and entered martyr-like, instead of blustering in like the tigress she was.<br />\n\"Oscar,\" she said with a timely sob, \"don't you really feel<br />\nanything when you kiss that awful leading lady ?\" \"Don't be asinine!\" Evidently Oscar was madder than usual. \"I feel her lips<br />\non mine, of course.\" \"But, dear, I mean it doesn't mean anything<br />\nat all?\"<br />\nBy jacks, Agatha was pretty. And here she was crying\u2014the<br />\ndear! He slipped his arm around her; and Agatha quickly got her<br />\nhead on his chest, her eyes and mouth out of sight. \"Darling,\" he<br />\nwent on softly, pitching his voice down two tones to where Mr.<br />\nGegotensky had told him his most seducing sounds were, \"a moment before I kiss her I tear up a letter, a moment after I light a<br />\ncigarette. All three of these are merely stage business\u2014that's all.<br />\nEach one is as important as the other two, and all three most pleasant when I do them well. (Pretty nicely said, Oscar thought,<br />\nsome day he'd have to write something too.) But can't you understand?\" \"And it doesn't mean a thing ?\" \"Not a thing!\" he answered, and he knew he was taking the right attitude, the professional attitude.<br /><br />\nWell, the play was over at last. Oscar sighed a little. Now<br />\nhe'd have to get down to business, he'd had his fun and now to<br />\nwork. Of course, it had been fun. His friends were all very kind<br />\nafter his performance, and although he would surely discount some<br />\nof the more obvious flattery, these people knew what they were<br />\ntalking about all right. And he wasn't such a fool as to call himself conceited when he knew he had done a good thing. No, no,<br />\nthat type was the worst of all\u2014inferiority complexes, afraid to be<br />\nfrank about their good qualities. And then he had had some quite<br />\nsensible adverse criticism too. For instance, the fellow who said<br />\nhis leading lady hadn't given him all the reactions she might have,<br />\nand the one who saw immediately that the play itself had held back<br />\nso many of his most attractive little touches.<br />\nBut now that was all over. Yes, yes, he'd rave to get back to<br />\nthe grind now, and make up for some of those long hours of rehearsing. Besides, it would please Agatha so if he quit for a while.<br />\nYes, he'd have to tell the Spielshoppers that he simply couldn't<br />\nkeep his promise about that new play of theirs. He had told them<br />\nthat as soon as this other one was over, he'd come to them, but a<br />\nman couldn't waste all his time on his recreation! The world was<br />\ntoo much with him for that! They had been rehearsing two weeks<br />\nwithout him with an understudy, but\u2014well, let the other fellow<br />\nhave a shot at a part. Sure, that was it. The Spielshoppers needed<br />\nsome young blood anyway. And then, too, he was very busy, very<br />\nbusy. Yes, there was the answer; he'd go right over and let them<br />\nbeg all they pleased; he just wouldn't do it. And he'd come back<br />\nto Agatha immediately.<br />\nThe stage manager of the Spielshoppers met him at the door<br />\nof the little theater. In a moment they were inside. \"Here you<br />\nare, Oscar,\" he was saying proudly, \"your leading lady, Miss<br />\nKeener.\" It didn't take Oscar a second to grasp the whole situation. The large brown eyes, the perfect little nose, the luscious<br />\nmouth, the skin as clear as crystal and as smooth as velvet.<br />\n\"You know, I just couldn't wait to get over to this play of<br />\nyours!\" Oscar announced confidentially. \"Damn glad that other<br />\nthing is over---it was such a farce! How have you managed with<br />\nthe understudy? Pretty bad, eh? . . . No? What? Oh!.<br />\nWell, let's get started by all means!\"<br />\nNo, no, Agatha, not a thing, not a thing!<br /><br />\nString Suits<br />\nTopcoats<br /><br />\nPriced<br /><br />\n$35 up<br /><br />\nHYMAN W.

Hanover St., Baltimore<br />\nBlood and something akin to thunder, heightened by bold<br />\nstage settings of red and black, provided novel entertainment at<br />\nthe Playshop Theater Monday night in the forni of a fiery Spanish<br />\nmelodrama.<br />\nThe play is \"The Great Galeoto,\" by Jose Echagaray, considered the best work of the playwright. It represents another addition to the list of national dramas presented by the Hopkins little<br />\ntheater group this season.<br />\nRepeated curtain calls at the end of each act and almost unanimous applause during the progress of the play gave evidence of<br />\nthe sympathetic reception accorded the efforts of the Playshoppers<br />\nby the most demonstrative audience of the year. \u2022<br />\nIt was the spirit and ability of the principals in the cast that<br />\ncarried off successfully what was undoubtedly a very difficult and,<br />\nat times, bloody task. For the play itself is of that highly emotional type which fairly boils with the struggle of the fiercer passions and which employs diction that is sometimes too rhetorical<br />\nto be convincing. It takes good acting, in this cynical age, to keep<br />\nsuch a play from being laughed at.<br />\nThe play was much improved, in the modern sense, according to the Play-shop management, by judicious cutting and revising of long soliloquies and asides, \"naturalizing the florid artificial<br />\ndiction and subduing to some slight extent the interpretation.\"<br />\nJealousy, inflamed by false gossip, is the driving force of the<br />\ndrama. Don Julian, a wealthy elderly Spanish gentleman, ot upright character, is happily married to a pretty young girl of twenty,<br />\nwho loves him deeply. Living with them is an impulsive young<br />\nman whom Don Julian has befriended. People begin to talk maliciously of the really blameless relations between the two young<br />\npeople. This gossip, broadcast by chronic scandal-mongers, among<br />\nwhom is Don Julian's brother, comes finally to the ears of the husband and the insidious poison, working in him, results in bloodshed<br />\nand tragedy.<br />\nElise Cohen, as Julian's wife carries off this very exacting<br />\nrole without any awkwardness at all. Although she is not quite<br />\nequal to several of the boiling points of emotion in the play,<br />\nshe displays throughout a grace and poise and variety of expression that at once attract and hold attention.<br />\nEvans Rodgers, of Barnstormers fame, in the part of the<br />\nfiery young Spaniard, has appearance against him. He has to<br />\nact against the handicap of not looking like a poet-lover-swordsman of the romantic Ramon Navarro type which the part seems<br />\nto call for. This, of course, is purely a matter of nationality or<br />\nmake-up, for Rodgers certainly gets all the necessary steam behind.<br />\nthe role and he really acts\u2014there are no mistaking the particular<br />\nshades of emotion he wants to get across.<br />\nR.
