Dr. Allan is a<br />\nmember of the National Spiritual Assembly of Baha'i Consequently, the majority of his<br />\nremarks concerned the Baha'i<br />\nperspective on the present<br />\ninternational situation and the<br />\nneed to develop a \"world<br />\nconsciousness.\"<br />\nAllan believes that the problem with educating people to<br />\ndevelop a world consciousness is<br />\nthat education is too often<br />\ndevoted to \"crisis learning;\" that<br />\nis, a situation must be at a<br />\ncritical point before it will be<br />\nexamined and dealt with. The<br />\nchallenge of education is to<br />\nreplace \"crisis learning\" with<br />\n\"anticipatory learning.\"<br />\nAllan said that \"The future<br />\ncan be studied as systematically<br />\nas the past.\" He believes that<br />\nmany theories about the past<br />\n<br />\nand even the present are guesswork at best, the same sort of<br />\nintellectual processes should be<br />\napplied to future events.<br />\nAllan emphasized that the<br />\nkey to educating in world<br />\nconsciousness is finding a way to<br />\neducate about the future of<br />\nhumanity; the reality that the<br />\nworld is an interdependent system needs to become part of<br />\nmankind's daily thought. He<br />\nalso stressed that attention must<br />\nbe paid to the creation of a value<br />\nperspective, as \"learning by itself<br />\nis not enough.\"<br />\nDr. Allan devoted the rest<br />\nof his address to the Baha'i<br />\nperspective on world consciousness. This viewpoint consists of<br />\ntwo aspects: the secular, in<br />\nwhich education makes technological and material advancement possible; and the spiritual,<br />\nwithout which the physical<br />\naspects can \"create terror.\" Its<br />\npurpose in the secular arena of<br />\nlife it to make peace with the<br />\nsurrounding environment; the<br />\nultimate purpose of the spiritual<br />\narena is dealing with one's<br />\nidentity.<br />\nAllan spoke of the devel-<br />\n<br />\nAnything Goes<br />\nSpring Fair Weekend<br />\ncont. from p.

A highly renouned<br />\nHarvard psychiatrist and columnist, Dr. Poussaint is also the<br />\nauthor of Why Blacks Kill<br />\nBlacks.<br />\nBeginning on a light note,<br />\nDr. Poussaint remarked, \"I'm<br />\nfrom the Harvard Medical<br />\nSchool and it's good to come<br />\ndown here and see what No. 2<br />\nlooks like.\"<br />\nDr. Poussaint allowed that<br />\nthere may be some exaggeration<br />\nof the difficulties blacks have<br />\nin organizing but stated that<br />\nblacks do in fact face special<br />\nobstacles. Dr. Poussaint pointed<br />\nout that the Black Consciousness<br />\nMovement was stigmatized as<br />\nbeing separatist from the very<br />\nbeginning. These charges of<br />\nseparatism have been leveled<br />\nselectively against black organizations, claimed Poussaint;other<br />\nethnic and religious organizations have not been so brande<br />\nLater in his speech, Poussaint examined the political<br />\noppositions to the nascent black<br />\norganizations of the 1960's. He<br />\ndescribed how the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)laundied a massive covert drive<br />\n<br />\nto disrupt black groupsps when<br />\nJ. Edgar Hoover was director of<br />\nthe agency.<br />\nPoussaint said that along<br />\nwith attempts to discredit and<br />\nneutralize black leaders, the FBI<br />\nrecruited at least 7500 agents to<br />\ninfiltrate and disrupt black organizations. Dr. Poussaint noted<br />\nthat only part of the story is<br />\nknown. While it is clear that the<br />\nCentral Intelligence Agency<br />\n(CIA) was also involved in these<br />\nactivities, its records on them<br />\nhave not yet been made public.<br />\nDr. Poussaint also listed<br />\nvarious psychological roadblacks<br />\nto black unity. Because blacks<br />\nwere long forced to labor under<br />\na burden of supposed \"inferiority,\" a tendency towards oversensitivity concerning self-dignity has devloped, making close<br />\ncooperation more difficult.<br />\nPoussaint cautioned black<br />\ncollege students not to ignore<br />\norganizing on campuses. He said<br />\nthat the many black students<br />\ntoday believe that they have<br />\nmade it to college strictly<br />\nbecause of their own intellectual<br />\ntalent, not realizing that the<br />\npossibility of their attending<br />\ncollege at all is based on past<br />\nvictories<br />\npolitical<br />\nattained<br />\nthrough organizing.<br />\nDr. Poussaint's lecture was<br />\nsponsored by the JHU Black<br />\n'Student Union.

More importantly,<br />\nhowever, the SC's action reinforces a widespread belief that<br />\nthe Student Council has degenerated into a forum for political bullshit. To claim that the<br />\nCouncil serves no purpose<br />\nis foolish, but some major<br />\nchanges in attitudes and actions are warranted. With<br />\nregard to actions, what the<br />\nstudent body wants to see is<br />\nless politics and more concrete<br />\nresults.

This year, the<br />\nStudent Council felt compelled<br />\nto ask the Fair Board to take<br />\ninto account budgetary constraints afflicting everyone and<br />\nlimit the amount of money it<br />\nwould spend on itself. As a<br />\nStudent Council sub-committee,<br />\nthe Spring Fair is under the<br />\njurisdiction of the Council. The<br />\nS.C. made a reasonable request<br />\nthat the Board trim its party<br />\nplans. Sixteen hundred dollars<br />\nseems more than reasonable for<br />\na one-night bash, especially<br />\nwhen the funds could be going<br />\nback into the dangerously deflated S.A.C. budget, free S.A.C.<br />\ngroups from University budget<br />\ntyranny, and provide that much<br />\nmore money for dances, concerts, lectures and next year's<br />\nFair.<br />\nNo one sought to \"squelch\"<br />\nthe Fair Party. The S.C. unanimously felt that some funds<br />\nshould be used to help fair<br />\nworkers celebrate a difficult job<br />\nwell done. It is, however, a little<br />\nshocking that people expected<br />\nunlimited expenditures on themselves, and even insisted that<br />\nsuch expenditure was owed to<br />\nthem. The Council's request<br />\ncollided with inflated expectations fueled by last year's excess.<br />\nOne is forced to question the<br />\nattitude that defines reward<br />\nquantitatively and places a price<br />\ntag on a good time: if the Fair<br />\nBoard finds itself unable to<br />\nenjoy a $1600 party, then<br />\nperhaps it should look elsewhere<br />\nthan at the Student Council for<br />\nthe sources of its unhappiness.<br />\nThe Council's request in no<br />\nway represents unwararanted<br />\nintervention in the running of<br />\nSpring Fair. A Fair Board Party<br />\nis hardly a Fair operation<br />\ncomparable to the booking of<br />\nbands or the assignment of food<br />\nconcessions. On such matters,<br />\nCouncil involvement would be<br />\nfoolish meddling indeed. But the<br />\n<br />\nself-serving arrogance of the Fair<br />\nBoard in asserting that the<br />\nFair is somehow above student<br />\npolitics is rediculous. From the<br />\nStudent Council's selection of<br />\nthe Fair Chairmen (who often<br />\ncome from the ranks of the<br />\nStudent Council) to the location<br />\nof booths on the fair grounds,<br />\nthe whole Fair process is part of<br />\nstudent politics. Limiting the<br />\nFair's party expenditures may<br />\nhave been politics, but of the<br />\nmost responsible kind.<br />\nThe News-Letter editor's<br />\ncomplaints supported the Fair<br />\nBoard's questionable attitude<br />\nand flirted dangerously with<br />\nirresponsibility. His charge that<br />\nCouncil members freely help<br />\nthemselves to \"fringe benefits\"<br />\nis simply without foundation.<br />\nAnd the allegation that student<br />\nfunds finance mysterious Council \"after-hours get-togethers\"<br />\nmust be the product of the<br />\nafter-hours<br />\neditor's<br />\nown<br />\nfantasies.<br />\nof<br />\ntime<br />\na<br />\nIn<br />\nacross-the-board budget cuts, it<br />\ndoes not seem unreasonable<br />\nthat the Fair Board would limit<br />\nwhat it spends on itself. The<br />\nSpring Fair does not exist in a<br />\nvacuum, and neither do its<br />\nprofits. It is unfortunate that<br />\nthe crux of the matter has been<br />\nlost in self-centeredness and<br />\nrhetorical flourishes.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nRobert Elkin<br />\n<br />\nModest Proposal<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have read with interest and<br />\nrevulsion your well presented<br />\naccount of the current wave of<br />\nhorrid vandalism that seems to<br />\nhave swept over our Campus.<br />\nTo say that I am both horrified<br />\nand disgusted would be the<br />\nepitome of understatement.<br />\nThis University is a private<br />\ninstitution; it should be sacrosanct, holy ground for those of<br />\nus who belong here, and seek to<br />\nprotect and care for the heritage<br />\nof beauty and value that the<br />\nCampus gives us. That riff-raff,<br />\noutsiders, the scum of human<br />\nbeings should invade our precincts. and commit the foul<br />\noutrages described, is beyond<br />\nendurance.<br />\n<br />\nObviously such creatures<br />\nwork at night, under cover of<br />\nsneakiness abd and darkness, to<br />\nwreak their mindless, gutter-bred<br />\nactivities.

Therefore, I<br />\nventure to propose the following<br />\nplan of action, which, I hope,<br />\ncontains certain tactical possibilities that may be effective:<br />\nPlan to Combat Vandalism<br />\n1. Organize a force of mature,<br />\ncompetent, senior students,<br />\npreferably ROTC cadets, to be<br />\npledged to extra duty. A force<br />\nof perhaps 20 capable, disciplined young men. This force to<br />\nelect its own officers, capable of<br />\nand leading its<br />\ndirecting<br />\nmembers. 2. Have this Special<br />\nForce alerted to serve as a<br />\nnightly patrol, covering the<br />\ncampus during all hours of<br />\ndarkness. Have its members<br />\nproperly equipped with good,<br />\nstrong billies, hand-cuffs, and a<br />\nsupply of rope.<br />\n3.<br />\nTrain these Special Force students in the technique of silent,<br />\nunseen action - if necessary<br />\nblacken their faces and hands, so<br />\nas to be invisible in darkness.<br />\nThe ROTC Officers and myself,<br />\nwho is a retired Regular<br />\nOfficer, all know the technique<br />\nand tactics to be emplcved.<br />\n4. Have this organization, after.<br />\nadequate training, patrol the<br />\ncampus, silently and unseen; this<br />\nmay require much patience,<br />\nsince no one can determine in<br />\nadvance when these contemptible riff-raff trespassers and<br />\nvandals will strike - the<br />\nobjective is to be ready for<br />\nthem, regardless of how many<br />\nhours may be spent in patrols,<br />\nbefore the creatures are observed, tracked, and apprehended.<br />\n5.<br />\nWhen these vandals are<br />\ntracked and observed, THEN<br />\nSTRIKE: throw a cordon about<br />\nthem all; let not one escape.<br />\nSurround and hit them as would<br />\na combat patrol in no-man's<br />\nland; knock them down, beat<br />\nthem soundly with the issued<br />\nwooden \"billies\", until they<br />\nsqueal for mercy; then hand-cuff<br />\nevery one and rope them in one<br />\ncolumn like convicts (which<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br />\n<br />\n, spring<br />\n, for st<br />\n- exami<br />\nadditi<br />\nfacult<br />\ntheir<br />\n\u2022 sched<br />\n\u2022 the M<br />\n<br />\nweek<br />\ndecisi<br />\n\u2022 Unive<br />\nHome<br />\ned w<br />\n1978chang<br />\n<br />\n..131<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\nTrust<br />\nlast v<br />\nSquir<br />\nYour<br />\ngradu<br />\nby St<br />\nis gr<br />\nafter<br />\ncomn<br />\nBoar(<br />\ncorpc<br />\nversit<br />\nand i<br />\ntuitic<br />\nbuild<br />\n<br />\nStudi<br />\nhas !<br />\n<br />\n, agree<br />\nI had<br />\nother<br />\nmeml<br />\n, missi,<br />\nI Kam(<br />\ncould<br />\nI<br />\n' tion<br />\nf presi(<br />\ncause<br />\nappel<br />\nJones<br />\nshe I<br />\ndates<br />\nprintl<br />\nter, v<br />\ned.'<br />\n. and (<br />\nSome<br />\nbeen<br />\nwas (<br />\nhave<br />\n)<br />\ndates<br />\non th<br />\ntative<br />\nrepre<br />\npresi(<br />\nt er.<br />\nsays<br />\nonly<br />\nthat<br />\nheld<br />\nfive<br />\nsenta<br />\ncandi<br />\n<br />\njunio<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nEarly Exams Defeat<br />\nStudy Week Purpose<br />\nsemester, and called for approximately two additional weeks of<br />\nThe<br />\nnewly-established instruction.

I was trim and<br />\nspruce, with a haircut that my Italian barber said was<br />\nvery much: \"Lika an Italian,\" although my mother was<br />\nhorrified by my pencil thin mustache.<br />\nThe flight over was unexciting; the only interesting thing about it was the fact that it would stop in<br />\nTeheran, Istanbul, Karachi, and Bombay after it left<br />\nRome. The passenger list matched the destinations, but<br />\nthe flight instructions were read in English, French,<br />\nGerman and Italian; so terribly, I might add, that a few<br />\nItalians sitting in front of me remained ignorant of how<br />\nto get out of the plane in an emergency. No matter,\"ha<br />\nha,\" no one could survive anyway. In short, the flight<br />\nwas a zoo, and the movies were awful besides; but since<br />\nthere was no crash, it was a dull opening to a year of<br />\nwhich I had great expectations.<br />\n<br />\nA journey Through the Past<br />\nThe Hopkins Bologna Program was one of the<br />\nprinciple reasons for my going to this place, so when I<br />\nreceived word that I had not made the list of initial<br />\nacceptances, I spent a very nervous month or so. I kept<br />\nasking those who were accepted whether they were<br />\ngoing or not. From their answers, I was able to figure<br />\nout that I would, barring a disaster, make the list;<br />\nrendering unnecessary my contingency plan, which'<br />\ncalled for a midnight kidnapping, the object being to<br />\ndeposit one of my luckier schoolfellows in the Patapsco<br />\nRiver dressed in concrete overshoes.<br />\n<br />\nshoulders, and, when we had recovered from the cloud<br />\nof dust created by the impact, I asked him (phonetically): \"Dough-vey la sta-tzione chen-tra-lay?\" It was then<br />\nthat I discovered the fatal weakness of all phrase books:<br />\nThey do not give the answers. After a few minutes of<br />\nchatter, the man pointed. I nodded my thanks and<br />\nheaded off.<br />\nI finally arrived at the main platform. It was<br />\nincredibly hot, so I threw down my crap and found a<br />\nwater fountain. I also attempted to memorize the<br />\nproper phrases for purchasing a ticket to Bologna.<br />\nHaving done so, I left my bags on the platform (at that<br />\npoint, I didn't care whether or not they were stolen;<br />\nanyone who could carry them and run could keep them,<br />\nas far as I was concerned) and went up to the ticket<br />\nwindow. \"Um, er... uh; do you speak English?\" So<br />\nmuch for sounding like an Italian.<br />\n<br />\nSettling in, Pensiont.<br />\nThe Bologna Center supplied the new arrivals<br />\nwith an information packet that was quite useful.<br />\nIt contained lists of restaurants and places to stay, in<br />\naddition to more specialized information: a list of<br />\nbeauty parlors, for example. I moved out of my hotel,<br />\nand into a \"pensione \", or a spare room in someone's<br />\napartment. After haggling with the landlady for a<br />\nhalf-hour, difficult because I spoke no Italian and she<br />\nspoke neither English or French, I got a bed for myself,<br />\nand reserved one for each of my rommates to be. He<br />\ndidn't arrive, but I didn't have to pay for it. Lucky, I<br />\nguess.<br />\nOne feature of these places was that the showers<br />\nwere not free. This smacked of treachery to my redblooded (and clean-skinned) soul, so I did without for a<br />\nweek. I retained my pride at the cost of social ostracism; what do I care: A friend of mine hit upon a clever<br />\nstratagem: he pretended that he was Swedish, and took<br />\na cold shower daily, singing nordic anthems, while<br />\nassuring his befuddled landlady that it was the custom in<br />\nhis homeland.<br />\n<br />\nItalian\u00b0 al'Intensivo<br />\nSeptember arrived, and with it, our first classes.<br />\nAll us linguistic neophytes were to be subjected to an<br />\nintensive Italian course. The course would take up five<br />\nhours a day for a month, and was subject to a stringent<br />\nselective process in order to weed out the total clods<br />\n(and the brilliant people) from the run-of-the-mill<br />\ncrowd.<br />\nWe all lined up, and filed into the room where<br />\nour inquisitors waited. It was over quickly: \"Buongiorno.\" \"Uh...buongiorno.\" \"Hai studiato italiano?\"<br />\n\"What?\" \"Have you studied Italian?\" \"Oh, yeah,<br />\nhaha, a coupla days out of a phrase book, haha.\" For<br />\nthat brilliant effort I was put in the advanced class.<br />\nThe course was taught by Italian women who<br />\nstudied at the University of Bologna. They were very<br />\nnice, and were all united in their inability to speak<br />\nEnglish, or even French. In the long run this was good,<br />\nbut at the beginning: \"abbadabba, dabba, dabba.\" (in<br />\nunison) \"What?\" \"Eh...va bene; abbadabba, dabba<br />\ndaP)a.\" \"What?\" And so on.<br />\nHowever, by the end of the course, we could<br />\nspeak enough Italian to manage on our own; grammar<br />\nand vocabulary would come later, during the formal<br />\nlanguage classes.<br />\n<br />\nMy calculations were correct, and I received the<br />\nwelcome news in April. Immediately, my future housemates and I (these housing plans had been made during<br />\nmy freshman year, due to incurable optimism) repaired<br />\nto the Grad Club and celebrated on pizza and Italian<br />\nwine (not that we could tell the difference from other<br />\nwines) and got extremely drunk. We decided that we<br />\nwouldn't speak any English, only Italian, which was<br />\nrather difficult, since at the time we didn't speak the<br />\nlanguage. In the end we were reduced to raising out Our House Is a Very, Very, Very<br />\nglasses and shouting: \"Maserati!\", \"Ferrari!\", and other Fine House<br />\nItalian brand names.<br />\nStudents at the Bologna Center are expected to<br />\nThe summer passed very quickly, and my<br />\nthoughts began to go along these lines: \"What will I be find their own housing, rather than live in dorms or in<br />\ndoing in three months?\", boasting about my adventure pensiones.

Many were the historical texts I'd<br />\nread, telling of the Medicis, their court, and the myriad<br />\nof brilliant renaissance sculptors and artists whom they<br />\nencouraged. It was also the home of Machiavelli, a<br />\nfamiliar name to all you political science buffs.<br />\nThe train ride was uneventful, although we found<br />\nout later that terrorists had attempted to destroy a train<br />\non the same line later in the day. They failed, but only<br />\njust, as the train had been switched to a different track,<br />\nand was only damaged when the bomb went off.<br />\nUpon arriving at the station, we decided not to<br />\n<br />\nFull of Bologna?<br />\n<br />\nDUCA<br />\nAL<br />\nSTY<br />\nTom<br />\ntry and see everything at once; only the two main<br />\nsquares and the Ufizzi gallery. As it was,it was still too<br />\nmuch.<br />\nThe first square, the Piazza del Duomo,contained a huge cathedral, surfaced with colored marble, and<br />\nwith a gigantic, centuries-old red-tiled dome. There was<br />\nalso the bell tower, with its golden bass-reliefs on the<br />\ndoors, which were, according to my faithful Michelin<br />\nguidebook, a four star attraction, and therefore not to<br />\nbe missed. There was one slight prblem: everyone else<br />\nwanted to see them too. The piazza was literally jammed with tourists. I struggled and fought my was<br />\nthrough hundreds of people, broke into the clear,<br />\nspotted a flash of the golden doors and was hurled aside<br />\nby a phalanx of German tourists, all intent on seeing the<br />\nwonders of Florence.<br />\nI found my friends on the periphery of this<br />\nmaelstrom,and we decided to go to the Ufizzi and spend<br />\nhours peacefully gazing at the artistic wonders within.<br />\nWe walked to the Piazza della Signoria, eyed the statues<br />\nand the pigeons,and went inside the museum.<br />\nIt started peacefully, as we filed through the first<br />\nrooms, but one of my comrades hung back, missed a<br />\nturn, and vanished. After several others disappeared, I<br />\nbegan to get worried. I walked into the Botticelli room,<br />\nand then it hit me: This was the major leagues! All the<br />\npaintings were brilliant, at least to my inexperienced<br />\neyes, and they all centered around religious themes.<br />\n\"My God! I've just seen 250 Madonnas, Pietas, and<br />\nCrucifixions, and I haven't even reached the half-way<br />\nmark!\" Strong stuff for an agnostic like myself. My eyes<br />\nglazed over, and I quickened my pace, rushing from one<br />\nroom to another: \"Ah, Titian, I've heard of him,\"<br />\ndoing a quick circuit of the room, and rushing out. One<br />\nhour later, gasping for breath, I threw myself out of the<br />\nmuseum. My friends and I dubbed the place \"Madonna<br />\non the Brain,\" and set out to something less arduous;<br />\nsuch as climbing the dome of the cathedral(from the<br />\ninside of course), admiring the view, descending, and<br />\ncatching the train back to Bologna.<br />\n<br />\nLost in a Lost World<br />\nAh, to be young and an undergraduate while at<br />\nthe Bologna Center! \"Well, we really don't know what<br />\nto do with you poor devils\"; the girl sitting next to me<br />\nfought back a sob, and we all stared at our advisor in<br />\nhorror. We staggered down to the in-house bar, and<br />\nhuddled around a table. We decided to act like adults<br />\nanyway, and brazen it out. A few grad students approached cautiously, and we eyes them with a degree of<br />\napprehension. \"Say, are you guys really undergrads?\"<br />\n(In unison) \"Yeah? Wow!\" We gathered that grad<br />\n<br />\n\fstudents were human, too, so we all got along fine.<br />\nAfter a few minutes of formalities, most new<br />\nWe were supposed to take two required courses -- acquaintances would ask me: \"Causa pensate d'Italia?\"<br />\nones specially designed for our feeble intellects, no .It was easy to reply: \"Italia mi piace multissimo.\"<br />\ndoubt.

It was a buffet which comprised various<br />\ncold goodies heaped on rice, and covered with mayonnaise. One person put tuna, sausages, corn, olives,<br />\npeppers, onions, cheese, apples and potato chips on his<br />\nrice.

After only a<br />\nweek, I felt perfectly at home in terms of everyday<br />\ninteractions with shopkeepers, waiters, etc. When I<br />\nmade gaffes, or grevious errors in translations, they<br />\nlaughed and corrected me without rancor; although they<br />\nthought it odd that I would hit myself on the head,look<br />\nskyward, and mutter a few choice words after making<br />\nsuch a mistake(I don't like to make mistakes).<br />\nWith little effort, it was easy to get to know<br />\none's peers at the University of Bologna. They are as<br />\ncurious about young Americans as we are about them,<br />\nwhich made things easy. Although communication was<br />\nrough at first, it improved through time.<br />\nMy acquaintances can be divided into roughly<br />\nthree categories: Adults, \"Borghese\" students, and<br />\npoorer students. The main differences between the<br />\nlatter two are: speech, political outlook, lifestyle, and<br />\ngeographic origin. The borghese dressed better, spoke<br />\nclearly, were center-left, had money, and were Bologna<br />\nborn. The others were far-left, had little money, and<br />\nwere from elsewhere in Italy, particularly the South.<br />\nOn a given night, I could either be found in an<br />\nOsteria, drinking wine, arguing, singing, and pounding on<br />\nthe tables; at the Piazza Maggiore, huddled around a fire,<br />\nsmoking, and playing bongos; at a bar sipping coffee; at<br />\na film; staggering through the streets, arm-in -arm with a<br />\ncollection of shouting drunks; or, especially after my<br />\ntime and money got short, at the good ol' Bologna<br />\nCenter libes.<br />\nThe adults ran the gamut from the jovial couple<br />\nwho befriended my rommate and me at a Communist<br />\nfestival, to the four foot tall, 200 pound, mustachioed<br />\nelderly ladies who knocked me off-balance in the buses,<br />\nsnarlin as the went b<br />\n<br />\nReturn to Realty: Exams<br />\nFor some cockeyed reason, they have exams after<br />\nChristmas at Bologna, instead of before (actually, it's<br />\njustifiable because classes don't start until October, but<br />\nso what?). As a result, I dragged a suitcase full of books<br />\nup to Paris, and naturally didn't open it at all. Upon<br />\nreturning, I shut myself in the libes for some intensive<br />\nstudying.<br />\nThe exam period was highlighted by my first oral<br />\nexam ever, and after discussing it with some grads (\"This<br />\none guy answered the professor's questions wrong, and<br />\nthe professor laughed at him\") I was terrified. I walked<br />\ninto the professor's office, and he assured me that there<br />\nwas no reason to be nervous. He then asked me the first<br />\nquestion. I stammered out the first sentences, and as I<br />\ngained confidence, the words rolled out smoothly until<br />\nthe professor interrupted: \"You've made some points,<br />\nbut you haven't touched on the central theme of the<br />\nproblem.\" \"Eep!\" I did end up doing well in spite of<br />\nmyself.<br />\n<br />\nIt's Student Demonstration Time<br />\nPolitics in Italy is far removed from the pathy-inducing bullshit in this country. For one thing, there are<br />\nso many parties that everyone can choose one that<br />\nclosely fits his individual beliefs. Because Bologna is in<br />\nthe middle of the Italian \"Red Belt\", there is a lively<br />\npolitical climate. There is room for every party, from<br />\nthe Neo-Fascists to the Automanis (Radical Fringe<br />\nMolotov Tossing Gonzos). This freedom leads to a lot of<br />\nconfrontations, which, when combined with the many<br />\nproblems of the University, leads to that bugaboo of the<br />\n60's the student demonstration.<br />\nIt is frightening to us Americans to see frowning<br />\nriot troopers, armed to the teeth, patrolling the streets.<br />\nBut after a while, one gets used to it. They seemed<br />\nfairly restained; their one weakness was the enthusiastic<br />\nutilization of tear gas. (This didn't always work to their<br />\nadvantage; a group of riot cops surrounded some demonstrators, cut loose with their tear gas launchers, but<br />\novershot, gassing their own people and some bystanders<br />\ninstead.)<br />\nThe only demonstration I took any part in was<br />\none to commemorate the murder/ accidental shooting of<br />\na student who was at a Christian Democrat meeting/a<br />\nbystander/ or a participant in an attack on the meeting;<br />\nhe was shot by the police/Autonomisti/ Fascist agents<br />\nprovocateurs; a shooting that resulted in a week of<br />\nriotin .<br />\n<br />\nIt was fairly peaceful, punctuated by the occasional breaking of car windows (by the less restrained<br />\ndemonstrators, to the disapproval of the majority). The<br />\npolice were out in force, and every time we passed a<br />\ngroup of them, the crowd pointed at them shouting<br />\n\"assassini!\" It was interesting, although I felt rather<br />\nstrange, since I had no real reason to be there, aside from<br />\n<br />\n-ng My Tortellini and Eating<br />\nThem, Too<br />\nHey, it you are going to eat, Bologna, is the place<br />\nto go. It is the home of tortellini (a small dumpling like<br />\nravioli), egg noodles (tagliatelle), and mortadella (a<br />\nsausage resembling American bologna), but the latter is<br />\nan aquired taste. The standards of preparation were<br />\nhigh, and the quality excellent.<br />\nMost moneywise students ate at least one meal a<br />\nday in the University of Bologna's student cafeterias, or<br />\n\"mense.\" For the equivalent of 60 cents, one could<br />\nhave a three course meal of mediocre quality, with pasta,<br />\nmeat and vegetables, and a piece of fruit.<br />\nThere were three of these in the vicinity of the<br />\nBologna Center; one of them was a giant hall that<br />\nresembled a church. Because it was also easy to sneak<br />\ninto, the real student lowlife hung out there, with their<br />\ndogs, begging, stealing food, drinking the dregs out of<br />\nwine bottles, and passing out on their trays.<br />\nThe other two catered to more middle class<br />\nconstituents, although the food was no better.<br />\nThere were also trattorie, small family-run<br />\nrestaurants with fixed-price menus, and abundant<br />\nportions of plain, but delicious, food. Each \"trat\" had a<br />\nsteady customers who sat around drinking wine and<br />\narguing with the owner. In one of them these patrons<br />\nwere rather decrepit, and the sight of them guzzling<br />\nwine, with noodles dripping down their chins, and<br />\nsmoking like furnaces, could put one off lunch. I<br />\nwas always afraid one of them would keel over and die<br />\nwith his face in a bowl of spaghetti,but luckily, it never<br />\nhappened.<br />\nAnother catered to a group of painters and day<br />\nlaborers, and was owned by a hugh, red bearded man<br />\nwith a booming voice.

The incredible agitation and<br />\nrage protrayed by his struggling body are<br />\noffset by the bright, cheery smile of his<br />\n\"mask\", a feat which requries complete<br />\nisolation of the face.<br />\nNot only can Marceau change<br />\ncomplete facial expression instantly, but<br />\nhe can also switch from character to<br />\ncharacter with a mere spin or a short step<br />\nbehind a screen. \"David and Goliath\" is<br />\ndelightful as a seemingly six foot eleven<br />\ninch tall Goliath, the bully, chases the<br />\nmeek, four foot tall merry David around<br />\nthe stage. But the \"Public Garden\" is an<br />\neven better showcase for Marceau's talent<br />\nat metamorphosis. Starting with a chatty<br />\nold lady busily knitting and working his<br />\nway around the garden showing us the<br />\nballoon man, the nurse with the baby<br />\ncarriage, and at least another half-dozen<br />\ncharacters, Marceau shows the depth of<br />\nhis talent. His caricatures are mocking,<br />\ntie quiet aim<br />\n<br />\nbut in a friendly manner. No one gets<br />\nannoyed at the old lady for chatting even<br />\nthough Marceau has focused on what<br />\nwould probably seem irritating in everyday life. Instead, Marceau points out the<br />\namusing characteristics of the woman so<br />\nthat perhaps when we are victimized by<br />\noverly talkative people we will remember<br />\nMarceau and not feel so impatient.<br />\nAlthough Marceau is basically a<br />\nsoloist, he is aided by two people. The<br />\nstatue-like Yanci presents the cards which<br />\nannounce each skit while Marceau's<br />\nalter-ego, Bip, enjoys himself. Bip is<br />\nMarceau's most famous character. He is<br />\nan engaging fellow who entertains himself<br />\nand everyone else by socializing, playing<br />\nthe violin, and taming lions. A true<br />\ncharmer, Bip is a very real person.<br />\nEvery move Marceau makes helps<br />\nto define space. He rolls his fingers and<br />\nthe bit of space there is a piece of clay.<br />\nHe throws the clay, and then moves to<br />\nthe other side of the stage and throws<br />\nsome more clay which almost visibly joins<br />\nthe first bit. He flys a kite and every<br />\ndetail about the weather is known. He<br />\neats dinner and the exact menu is obvious. Marceau pulls houses out of bare<br />\nfloor boards as a magician would pull<br />\nrabbits out of a hat.<br />\nThere are no tricks up the mime's<br />\nsleeve\u2014it is pure magic.<br />\nUnfortunately, Marceau also does<br />\na good disappearing trick; after two<br />\nshows he was gone. Marceau played to<br />\nfull houses both times, but there were<br />\nstill not enough opportunities to see the<br />\nlegend perform. Hopkins was extremely<br />\nlucky to have had this opportunity. In<br />\nthis day of loud music, loud airplanes,<br />\nand loud clothing, it is gratifying to come<br />\nin contact with the quiet but worthy<br />\nMarcel Marceau.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 16 / APRIL 18, 1980<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's Literary Renaissance<br />\n<br />\nWriters Council Pulls All Together<br />\npredicts further resurgence of publication and literary activities in Baltimore<br />\nand<br />\nThe Maryland Writers Council due to the increasing influx of writers<br />\npublicamagazine<br />\nin<br />\ned<br />\nexperienc<br />\npeople<br />\na<br />\nis<br />\nPaul,<br />\nSt.<br />\n(MWC), located at 1110<br />\nan attractive<br />\nstate and corporately funded office that tion.

Dr. Allan is a<br />\nmember of the National Spiritual Assembly of Baha'i Consequently, the majority of his<br />\nremarks concerned the Baha'i<br />\nperspective on the present<br />\ninternational situation and the<br />\nneed to develop a \"world<br />\nconsciousness.\"<br />\nAllan believes that the problem with educating people to<br />\ndevelop a world consciousness is<br />\nthat education is too often<br />\ndevoted to \"crisis learning;\" that<br />\nis, a situation must be at a<br />\ncritical point before it will be<br />\nexamined and dealt with. The<br />\nchallenge of education is to<br />\nreplace \"crisis learning\" with<br />\n\"anticipatory learning.\"<br />\nAllan said that \"The future<br />\ncan be studied as systematically<br />\nas the past.\" He believes that<br />\nmany theories about the past<br /><br />\nand even the present are guesswork at best, the same sort of<br />\nintellectual processes should be<br />\napplied to future events.<br />\nAllan emphasized that the<br />\nkey to educating in world<br />\nconsciousness is finding a way to<br />\neducate about the future of<br />\nhumanity; the reality that the<br />\nworld is an interdependent system needs to become part of<br />\nmankind's daily thought. He<br />\nalso stressed that attention must<br />\nbe paid to the creation of a value<br />\nperspective, as \"learning by itself<br />\nis not enough.\"<br />\nDr. Allan devoted the rest<br />\nof his address to the Baha'i<br />\nperspective on world consciousness. This viewpoint consists of<br />\ntwo aspects: the secular, in<br />\nwhich education makes technological and material advancement possible; and the spiritual,<br />\nwithout which the physical<br />\naspects can \"create terror.\" Its<br />\npurpose in the secular arena of<br />\nlife it to make peace with the<br />\nsurrounding environment; the<br />\nultimate purpose of the spiritual<br />\narena is dealing with one's<br />\nidentity.<br />\nAllan spoke of the devel-<br /><br />\nAnything Goes<br />\nSpring Fair Weekend<br />\ncont. from p.

A highly renouned<br />\nHarvard psychiatrist and columnist, Dr. Poussaint is also the<br />\nauthor of Why Blacks Kill<br />\nBlacks.<br />\nBeginning on a light note,<br />\nDr. Poussaint remarked, \"I'm<br />\nfrom the Harvard Medical<br />\nSchool and it's good to come<br />\ndown here and see what No. 2<br />\nlooks like.\"<br />\nDr. Poussaint allowed that<br />\nthere may be some exaggeration<br />\nof the difficulties blacks have<br />\nin organizing but stated that<br />\nblacks do in fact face special<br />\nobstacles. Dr. Poussaint pointed<br />\nout that the Black Consciousness<br />\nMovement was stigmatized as<br />\nbeing separatist from the very<br />\nbeginning. These charges of<br />\nseparatism have been leveled<br />\nselectively against black organizations, claimed Poussaint;other<br />\nethnic and religious organizations have not been so brande<br />\nLater in his speech, Poussaint examined the political<br />\noppositions to the nascent black<br />\norganizations of the 1960's. He<br />\ndescribed how the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)laundied a massive covert drive<br /><br />\nto disrupt black groupsps when<br />\nJ.

Dr. Poussaint noted<br />\nthat only part of the story is<br />\nknown. While it is clear that the<br />\nCentral Intelligence Agency<br />\n(CIA) was also involved in these<br />\nactivities, its records on them<br />\nhave not yet been made public.<br />\nDr. Poussaint also listed<br />\nvarious psychological roadblacks<br />\nto black unity. Because blacks<br />\nwere long forced to labor under<br />\na burden of supposed \"inferiority,\" a tendency towards oversensitivity concerning self-dignity has devloped, making close<br />\ncooperation more difficult.<br />\nPoussaint cautioned black<br />\ncollege students not to ignore<br />\norganizing on campuses. He said<br />\nthat the many black students<br />\ntoday believe that they have<br />\nmade it to college strictly<br />\nbecause of their own intellectual<br />\ntalent, not realizing that the<br />\npossibility of their attending<br />\ncollege at all is based on past<br />\nvictories<br />\npolitical<br />\nattained<br />\nthrough organizing.<br />\nDr. Poussaint's lecture was<br />\nsponsored by the JHU Black<br />\n'Student Union.

More importantly,<br />\nhowever, the SC's action reinforces a widespread belief that<br />\nthe Student Council has degenerated into a forum for political bullshit. To claim that the<br />\nCouncil serves no purpose<br />\nis foolish, but some major<br />\nchanges in attitudes and actions are warranted. With<br />\nregard to actions, what the<br />\nstudent body wants to see is<br />\nless politics and more concrete<br />\nresults.

This year, the<br />\nStudent Council felt compelled<br />\nto ask the Fair Board to take<br />\ninto account budgetary constraints afflicting everyone and<br />\nlimit the amount of money it<br />\nwould spend on itself. As a<br />\nStudent Council sub-committee,<br />\nthe Spring Fair is under the<br />\njurisdiction of the Council. The<br />\nS.C. made a reasonable request<br />\nthat the Board trim its party<br />\nplans. Sixteen hundred dollars<br />\nseems more than reasonable for<br />\na one-night bash, especially<br />\nwhen the funds could be going<br />\nback into the dangerously deflated S.A.C. budget, free S.A.C.<br />\ngroups from University budget<br />\ntyranny, and provide that much<br />\nmore money for dances, concerts, lectures and next year's<br />\nFair.<br />\nNo one sought to \"squelch\"<br />\nthe Fair Party. The S.C. unanimously felt that some funds<br />\nshould be used to help fair<br />\nworkers celebrate a difficult job<br />\nwell done. It is, however, a little<br />\nshocking that people expected<br />\nunlimited expenditures on themselves, and even insisted that<br />\nsuch expenditure was owed to<br />\nthem. The Council's request<br />\ncollided with inflated expectations fueled by last year's excess.<br />\nOne is forced to question the<br />\nattitude that defines reward<br />\nquantitatively and places a price<br />\ntag on a good time: if the Fair<br />\nBoard finds itself unable to<br />\nenjoy a $1600 party, then<br />\nperhaps it should look elsewhere<br />\nthan at the Student Council for<br />\nthe sources of its unhappiness.<br />\nThe Council's request in no<br />\nway represents unwararanted<br />\nintervention in the running of<br />\nSpring Fair. A Fair Board Party<br />\nis hardly a Fair operation<br />\ncomparable to the booking of<br />\nbands or the assignment of food<br />\nconcessions. On such matters,<br />\nCouncil involvement would be<br />\nfoolish meddling indeed. But the<br /><br />\nself-serving arrogance of the Fair<br />\nBoard in asserting that the<br />\nFair is somehow above student<br />\npolitics is rediculous. From the<br />\nStudent Council's selection of<br />\nthe Fair Chairmen (who often<br />\ncome from the ranks of the<br />\nStudent Council) to the location<br />\nof booths on the fair grounds,<br />\nthe whole Fair process is part of<br />\nstudent politics. Limiting the<br />\nFair's party expenditures may<br />\nhave been politics, but of the<br />\nmost responsible kind.<br />\nThe News-Letter editor's<br />\ncomplaints supported the Fair<br />\nBoard's questionable attitude<br />\nand flirted dangerously with<br />\nirresponsibility. His charge that<br />\nCouncil members freely help<br />\nthemselves to \"fringe benefits\"<br />\nis simply without foundation.<br />\nAnd the allegation that student<br />\nfunds finance mysterious Council \"after-hours get-togethers\"<br />\nmust be the product of the<br />\nafter-hours<br />\neditor's<br />\nown<br />\nfantasies.<br />\nof<br />\ntime<br />\na<br />\nIn<br />\nacross-the-board budget cuts, it<br />\ndoes not seem unreasonable<br />\nthat the Fair Board would limit<br />\nwhat it spends on itself. The<br />\nSpring Fair does not exist in a<br />\nvacuum, and neither do its<br />\nprofits. It is unfortunate that<br />\nthe crux of the matter has been<br />\nlost in self-centeredness and<br />\nrhetorical flourishes.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nRobert Elkin<br /><br />\nModest Proposal<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have read with interest and<br />\nrevulsion your well presented<br />\naccount of the current wave of<br />\nhorrid vandalism that seems to<br />\nhave swept over our Campus.<br />\nTo say that I am both horrified<br />\nand disgusted would be the<br />\nepitome of understatement.<br />\nThis University is a private<br />\ninstitution; it should be sacrosanct, holy ground for those of<br />\nus who belong here, and seek to<br />\nprotect and care for the heritage<br />\nof beauty and value that the<br />\nCampus gives us. That riff-raff,<br />\noutsiders, the scum of human<br />\nbeings should invade our precincts. and commit the foul<br />\noutrages described, is beyond<br />\nendurance.<br /><br />\nObviously such creatures<br />\nwork at night, under cover of<br />\nsneakiness abd and darkness, to<br />\nwreak their mindless, gutter-bred<br />\nactivities.

Therefore, I<br />\nventure to propose the following<br />\nplan of action, which, I hope,<br />\ncontains certain tactical possibilities that may be effective:<br />\nPlan to Combat Vandalism<br />\n1. Organize a force of mature,<br />\ncompetent, senior students,<br />\npreferably ROTC cadets, to be<br />\npledged to extra duty. A force<br />\nof perhaps 20 capable, disciplined young men. This force to<br />\nelect its own officers, capable of<br />\nand leading its<br />\ndirecting<br />\nmembers. 2. Have this Special<br />\nForce alerted to serve as a<br />\nnightly patrol, covering the<br />\ncampus during all hours of<br />\ndarkness. Have its members<br />\nproperly equipped with good,<br />\nstrong billies, hand-cuffs, and a<br />\nsupply of rope.<br />\n3.<br />\nTrain these Special Force students in the technique of silent,<br />\nunseen action - if necessary<br />\nblacken their faces and hands, so<br />\nas to be invisible in darkness.<br />\nThe ROTC Officers and myself,<br />\nwho is a retired Regular<br />\nOfficer, all know the technique<br />\nand tactics to be emplcved.<br />\n4. Have this organization, after.<br />\nadequate training, patrol the<br />\ncampus, silently and unseen; this<br />\nmay require much patience,<br />\nsince no one can determine in<br />\nadvance when these contemptible riff-raff trespassers and<br />\nvandals will strike - the<br />\nobjective is to be ready for<br />\nthem, regardless of how many<br />\nhours may be spent in patrols,<br />\nbefore the creatures are observed, tracked, and apprehended.<br />\n5.<br />\nWhen these vandals are<br />\ntracked and observed, THEN<br />\nSTRIKE: throw a cordon about<br />\nthem all; let not one escape.<br />\nSurround and hit them as would<br />\na combat patrol in no-man's<br />\nland; knock them down, beat<br />\nthem soundly with the issued<br />\nwooden \"billies\", until they<br />\nsqueal for mercy; then hand-cuff<br />\nevery one and rope them in one<br />\ncolumn like convicts (which<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br /><br />\n, spring<br />\n, for st<br />\n- exami<br />\nadditi<br />\nfacult<br />\ntheir<br />\n\u2022 sched<br />\n\u2022 the M<br /><br />\nweek<br />\ndecisi<br />\n\u2022 Unive<br />\nHome<br />\ned w<br />\n1978chang<br /><br />\n..131<br /><br />\n1<br />\nTrust<br />\nlast v<br />\nSquir<br />\nYour<br />\ngradu<br />\nby St<br />\nis gr<br />\nafter<br />\ncomn<br />\nBoar(<br />\ncorpc<br />\nversit<br />\nand i<br />\ntuitic<br />\nbuild<br /><br />\nStudi<br />\nhas !<br /><br />\n, agree<br />\nI had<br />\nother<br />\nmeml<br />\n, missi,<br />\nI Kam(<br />\ncould<br />\nI<br />\n' tion<br />\nf presi(<br />\ncause<br />\nappel<br />\nJones<br />\nshe I<br />\ndates<br />\nprintl<br />\nter, v<br />\ned.'<br />\n. and (<br />\nSome<br />\nbeen<br />\nwas (<br />\nhave<br />\n)<br />\ndates<br />\non th<br />\ntative<br />\nrepre<br />\npresi(<br />\nt er.<br />\nsays<br />\nonly<br />\nthat<br />\nheld<br />\nfive<br />\nsenta<br />\ncandi<br /><br />\njunio<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nEarly Exams Defeat<br />\nStudy Week Purpose<br />\nsemester, and called for approximately two additional weeks of<br />\nThe<br />\nnewly-established instruction.

Also, as I<br />\npointed out in the interview, a<br />\nmajor factor in our case was the<br />\nfact that Williams was in violation of Title 8, section 203 of<br />\nthe annotated Code of Maryland, which states that the<br />\nlease must contain language<br />\ninforming the tenants of their<br />\nrights concerning the security<br />\ndeposit. By violation of this<br />\nsection, the landlord automatically forfeits all claims to the<br />\nsecurity deposit.<br />\nFourth, Williams' defense<br />\nincluded testimony by himself<br />\nand his maintenance man, who,<br />\nduring questioning by ourselves,<br />\nadmitted that the apartment had<br />\nnot been inspected between the<br />\nprevious tenants' departure and<br />\nour arrival, and therefore, he<br />\ncould not state what, if any,<br />\ndamages were caused by ourselves.<br />\nFifth, I must reproach your<br />\nstaffer for not interviewing<br />\nBarry Caplan, no matter how<br />\nhard he is to pin down.

I was trim and<br />\nspruce, with a haircut that my Italian barber said was<br />\nvery much: \"Lika an Italian,\" although my mother was<br />\nhorrified by my pencil thin mustache.<br />\nThe flight over was unexciting; the only interesting thing about it was the fact that it would stop in<br />\nTeheran, Istanbul, Karachi, and Bombay after it left<br />\nRome. The passenger list matched the destinations, but<br />\nthe flight instructions were read in English, French,<br />\nGerman and Italian; so terribly, I might add, that a few<br />\nItalians sitting in front of me remained ignorant of how<br />\nto get out of the plane in an emergency. No matter,\"ha<br />\nha,\" no one could survive anyway. In short, the flight<br />\nwas a zoo, and the movies were awful besides; but since<br />\nthere was no crash, it was a dull opening to a year of<br />\nwhich I had great expectations.<br /><br />\nA journey Through the Past<br />\nThe Hopkins Bologna Program was one of the<br />\nprinciple reasons for my going to this place, so when I<br />\nreceived word that I had not made the list of initial<br />\nacceptances, I spent a very nervous month or so. I kept<br />\nasking those who were accepted whether they were<br />\ngoing or not. From their answers, I was able to figure<br />\nout that I would, barring a disaster, make the list;<br />\nrendering unnecessary my contingency plan, which'<br />\ncalled for a midnight kidnapping, the object being to<br />\ndeposit one of my luckier schoolfellows in the Patapsco<br />\nRiver dressed in concrete overshoes.<br /><br />\nshoulders, and, when we had recovered from the cloud<br />\nof dust created by the impact, I asked him (phonetically): \"Dough-vey la sta-tzione chen-tra-lay?\" It was then<br />\nthat I discovered the fatal weakness of all phrase books:<br />\nThey do not give the answers. After a few minutes of<br />\nchatter, the man pointed. I nodded my thanks and<br />\nheaded off.<br />\nI finally arrived at the main platform. It was<br />\nincredibly hot, so I threw down my crap and found a<br />\nwater fountain. I also attempted to memorize the<br />\nproper phrases for purchasing a ticket to Bologna.<br />\nHaving done so, I left my bags on the platform (at that<br />\npoint, I didn't care whether or not they were stolen;<br />\nanyone who could carry them and run could keep them,<br />\nas far as I was concerned) and went up to the ticket<br />\nwindow. \"Um, er... uh; do you speak English?\" So<br />\nmuch for sounding like an Italian.<br /><br />\nSettling in, Pensiont.<br />\nThe Bologna Center supplied the new arrivals<br />\nwith an information packet that was quite useful.<br />\nIt contained lists of restaurants and places to stay, in<br />\naddition to more specialized information: a list of<br />\nbeauty parlors, for example. I moved out of my hotel,<br />\nand into a \"pensione \", or a spare room in someone's<br />\napartment. After haggling with the landlady for a<br />\nhalf-hour, difficult because I spoke no Italian and she<br />\nspoke neither English or French, I got a bed for myself,<br />\nand reserved one for each of my rommates to be. He<br />\ndidn't arrive, but I didn't have to pay for it. Lucky, I<br />\nguess.<br />\nOne feature of these places was that the showers<br />\nwere not free. This smacked of treachery to my redblooded (and clean-skinned) soul, so I did without for a<br />\nweek. I retained my pride at the cost of social ostracism; what do I care: A friend of mine hit upon a clever<br />\nstratagem: he pretended that he was Swedish, and took<br />\na cold shower daily, singing nordic anthems, while<br />\nassuring his befuddled landlady that it was the custom in<br />\nhis homeland.<br /><br />\nItalian\u00b0 al'Intensivo<br />\nSeptember arrived, and with it, our first classes.<br />\nAll us linguistic neophytes were to be subjected to an<br />\nintensive Italian course.

It was over quickly: \"Buongiorno.\" \"Uh...buongiorno.\" \"Hai studiato italiano?\"<br />\n\"What?\" \"Have you studied Italian?\" \"Oh, yeah,<br />\nhaha, a coupla days out of a phrase book, haha.\" For<br />\nthat brilliant effort I was put in the advanced class.<br />\nThe course was taught by Italian women who<br />\nstudied at the University of Bologna. They were very<br />\nnice, and were all united in their inability to speak<br />\nEnglish, or even French. In the long run this was good,<br />\nbut at the beginning: \"abbadabba, dabba, dabba.\" (in<br />\nunison) \"What?\" \"Eh...va bene; abbadabba, dabba<br />\ndaP)a.\" \"What?\" And so on.<br />\nHowever, by the end of the course, we could<br />\nspeak enough Italian to manage on our own; grammar<br />\nand vocabulary would come later, during the formal<br />\nlanguage classes.<br /><br />\nMy calculations were correct, and I received the<br />\nwelcome news in April. Immediately, my future housemates and I (these housing plans had been made during<br />\nmy freshman year, due to incurable optimism) repaired<br />\nto the Grad Club and celebrated on pizza and Italian<br />\nwine (not that we could tell the difference from other<br />\nwines) and got extremely drunk. We decided that we<br />\nwouldn't speak any English, only Italian, which was<br />\nrather difficult, since at the time we didn't speak the<br />\nlanguage.

There was<br />\nalso the bell tower, with its golden bass-reliefs on the<br />\ndoors, which were, according to my faithful Michelin<br />\nguidebook, a four star attraction, and therefore not to<br />\nbe missed. There was one slight prblem: everyone else<br />\nwanted to see them too. The piazza was literally jammed with tourists. I struggled and fought my was<br />\nthrough hundreds of people, broke into the clear,<br />\nspotted a flash of the golden doors and was hurled aside<br />\nby a phalanx of German tourists, all intent on seeing the<br />\nwonders of Florence.<br />\nI found my friends on the periphery of this<br />\nmaelstrom,and we decided to go to the Ufizzi and spend<br />\nhours peacefully gazing at the artistic wonders within.<br />\nWe walked to the Piazza della Signoria, eyed the statues<br />\nand the pigeons,and went inside the museum.<br />\nIt started peacefully, as we filed through the first<br />\nrooms, but one of my comrades hung back, missed a<br />\nturn, and vanished. After several others disappeared, I<br />\nbegan to get worried. I walked into the Botticelli room,<br />\nand then it hit me: This was the major leagues! All the<br />\npaintings were brilliant, at least to my inexperienced<br />\neyes, and they all centered around religious themes.<br />\n\"My God! I've just seen 250 Madonnas, Pietas, and<br />\nCrucifixions, and I haven't even reached the half-way<br />\nmark!\" Strong stuff for an agnostic like myself. My eyes<br />\nglazed over, and I quickened my pace, rushing from one<br />\nroom to another: \"Ah, Titian, I've heard of him,\"<br />\ndoing a quick circuit of the room, and rushing out. One<br />\nhour later, gasping for breath, I threw myself out of the<br />\nmuseum. My friends and I dubbed the place \"Madonna<br />\non the Brain,\" and set out to something less arduous;<br />\nsuch as climbing the dome of the cathedral(from the<br />\ninside of course), admiring the view, descending, and<br />\ncatching the train back to Bologna.<br /><br />\nLost in a Lost World<br />\nAh, to be young and an undergraduate while at<br />\nthe Bologna Center! \"Well, we really don't know what<br />\nto do with you poor devils\"; the girl sitting next to me<br />\nfought back a sob, and we all stared at our advisor in<br />\nhorror. We staggered down to the in-house bar, and<br />\nhuddled around a table. We decided to act like adults<br />\nanyway, and brazen it out.

Although communication was<br />\nrough at first, it improved through time.<br />\nMy acquaintances can be divided into roughly<br />\nthree categories: Adults, \"Borghese\" students, and<br />\npoorer students. The main differences between the<br />\nlatter two are: speech, political outlook, lifestyle, and<br />\ngeographic origin. The borghese dressed better, spoke<br />\nclearly, were center-left, had money, and were Bologna<br />\nborn. The others were far-left, had little money, and<br />\nwere from elsewhere in Italy, particularly the South.<br />\nOn a given night, I could either be found in an<br />\nOsteria, drinking wine, arguing, singing, and pounding on<br />\nthe tables; at the Piazza Maggiore, huddled around a fire,<br />\nsmoking, and playing bongos; at a bar sipping coffee; at<br />\na film; staggering through the streets, arm-in -arm with a<br />\ncollection of shouting drunks; or, especially after my<br />\ntime and money got short, at the good ol' Bologna<br />\nCenter libes.<br />\nThe adults ran the gamut from the jovial couple<br />\nwho befriended my rommate and me at a Communist<br />\nfestival, to the four foot tall, 200 pound, mustachioed<br />\nelderly ladies who knocked me off-balance in the buses,<br />\nsnarlin as the went b<br /><br />\nReturn to Realty: Exams<br />\nFor some cockeyed reason, they have exams after<br />\nChristmas at Bologna, instead of before (actually, it's<br />\njustifiable because classes don't start until October, but<br />\nso what?).

Upon<br />\nreturning, I shut myself in the libes for some intensive<br />\nstudying.<br />\nThe exam period was highlighted by my first oral<br />\nexam ever, and after discussing it with some grads (\"This<br />\none guy answered the professor's questions wrong, and<br />\nthe professor laughed at him\") I was terrified. I walked<br />\ninto the professor's office, and he assured me that there<br />\nwas no reason to be nervous. He then asked me the first<br />\nquestion. I stammered out the first sentences, and as I<br />\ngained confidence, the words rolled out smoothly until<br />\nthe professor interrupted: \"You've made some points,<br />\nbut you haven't touched on the central theme of the<br />\nproblem.\" \"Eep!\" I did end up doing well in spite of<br />\nmyself.<br /><br />\nIt's Student Demonstration Time<br />\nPolitics in Italy is far removed from the pathy-inducing bullshit in this country. For one thing, there are<br />\nso many parties that everyone can choose one that<br />\nclosely fits his individual beliefs. Because Bologna is in<br />\nthe middle of the Italian \"Red Belt\", there is a lively<br />\npolitical climate. There is room for every party, from<br />\nthe Neo-Fascists to the Automanis (Radical Fringe<br />\nMolotov Tossing Gonzos). This freedom leads to a lot of<br />\nconfrontations, which, when combined with the many<br />\nproblems of the University, leads to that bugaboo of the<br />\n60's the student demonstration.<br />\nIt is frightening to us Americans to see frowning<br />\nriot troopers, armed to the teeth, patrolling the streets.<br />\nBut after a while, one gets used to it. They seemed<br />\nfairly restained; their one weakness was the enthusiastic<br />\nutilization of tear gas. (This didn't always work to their<br />\nadvantage; a group of riot cops surrounded some demonstrators, cut loose with their tear gas launchers, but<br />\novershot, gassing their own people and some bystanders<br />\ninstead.)<br />\nThe only demonstration I took any part in was<br />\none to commemorate the murder/ accidental shooting of<br />\na student who was at a Christian Democrat meeting/a<br />\nbystander/ or a participant in an attack on the meeting;<br />\nhe was shot by the police/Autonomisti/ Fascist agents<br />\nprovocateurs; a shooting that resulted in a week of<br />\nriotin .<br /><br />\nIt was fairly peaceful, punctuated by the occasional breaking of car windows (by the less restrained<br />\ndemonstrators, to the disapproval of the majority). The<br />\npolice were out in force, and every time we passed a<br />\ngroup of them, the crowd pointed at them shouting<br />\n\"assassini!\" It was interesting, although I felt rather<br />\nstrange, since I had no real reason to be there, aside from<br /><br />\n-ng My Tortellini and Eating<br />\nThem, Too<br />\nHey, it you are going to eat, Bologna, is the place<br />\nto go. It is the home of tortellini (a small dumpling like<br />\nravioli), egg noodles (tagliatelle), and mortadella (a<br />\nsausage resembling American bologna), but the latter is<br />\nan aquired taste. The standards of preparation were<br />\nhigh, and the quality excellent.<br />\nMost moneywise students ate at least one meal a<br />\nday in the University of Bologna's student cafeterias, or<br />\n\"mense.\" For the equivalent of 60 cents, one could<br />\nhave a three course meal of mediocre quality, with pasta,<br />\nmeat and vegetables, and a piece of fruit.<br />\nThere were three of these in the vicinity of the<br />\nBologna Center; one of them was a giant hall that<br />\nresembled a church. Because it was also easy to sneak<br />\ninto, the real student lowlife hung out there, with their<br />\ndogs, begging, stealing food, drinking the dregs out of<br />\nwine bottles, and passing out on their trays.<br />\nThe other two catered to more middle class<br />\nconstituents, although the food was no better.<br />\nThere were also trattorie, small family-run<br />\nrestaurants with fixed-price menus, and abundant<br />\nportions of plain, but delicious, food. Each \"trat\" had a<br />\nsteady customers who sat around drinking wine and<br />\narguing with the owner. In one of them these patrons<br />\nwere rather decrepit, and the sight of them guzzling<br />\nwine, with noodles dripping down their chins, and<br />\nsmoking like furnaces, could put one off lunch. I<br />\nwas always afraid one of them would keel over and die<br />\nwith his face in a bowl of spaghetti,but luckily, it never<br />\nhappened.<br />\nAnother catered to a group of painters and day<br />\nlaborers, and was owned by a hugh, red bearded man<br />\nwith a booming voice. He gallantly served the young<br />\nladies, leering all the while.

One<br />\ntime I was at a trattoria with a friend. The waitress, a<br />\nwoman who never smiled, and who recited the menu so<br />\nquickly that it was impossible to decipher what she said,<br />\nwas standing over us.

The incredible agitation and<br />\nrage protrayed by his struggling body are<br />\noffset by the bright, cheery smile of his<br />\n\"mask\", a feat which requries complete<br />\nisolation of the face.<br />\nNot only can Marceau change<br />\ncomplete facial expression instantly, but<br />\nhe can also switch from character to<br />\ncharacter with a mere spin or a short step<br />\nbehind a screen. \"David and Goliath\" is<br />\ndelightful as a seemingly six foot eleven<br />\ninch tall Goliath, the bully, chases the<br />\nmeek, four foot tall merry David around<br />\nthe stage. But the \"Public Garden\" is an<br />\neven better showcase for Marceau's talent<br />\nat metamorphosis. Starting with a chatty<br />\nold lady busily knitting and working his<br />\nway around the garden showing us the<br />\nballoon man, the nurse with the baby<br />\ncarriage, and at least another half-dozen<br />\ncharacters, Marceau shows the depth of<br />\nhis talent. His caricatures are mocking,<br />\ntie quiet aim<br /><br />\nbut in a friendly manner. No one gets<br />\nannoyed at the old lady for chatting even<br />\nthough Marceau has focused on what<br />\nwould probably seem irritating in everyday life. Instead, Marceau points out the<br />\namusing characteristics of the woman so<br />\nthat perhaps when we are victimized by<br />\noverly talkative people we will remember<br />\nMarceau and not feel so impatient.<br />\nAlthough Marceau is basically a<br />\nsoloist, he is aided by two people. The<br />\nstatue-like Yanci presents the cards which<br />\nannounce each skit while Marceau's<br />\nalter-ego, Bip, enjoys himself. Bip is<br />\nMarceau's most famous character. He is<br />\nan engaging fellow who entertains himself<br />\nand everyone else by socializing, playing<br />\nthe violin, and taming lions. A true<br />\ncharmer, Bip is a very real person.<br />\nEvery move Marceau makes helps<br />\nto define space. He rolls his fingers and<br />\nthe bit of space there is a piece of clay.<br />\nHe throws the clay, and then moves to<br />\nthe other side of the stage and throws<br />\nsome more clay which almost visibly joins<br />\nthe first bit. He flys a kite and every<br />\ndetail about the weather is known. He<br />\neats dinner and the exact menu is obvious. Marceau pulls houses out of bare<br />\nfloor boards as a magician would pull<br />\nrabbits out of a hat.<br />\nThere are no tricks up the mime's<br />\nsleeve\u2014it is pure magic.<br />\nUnfortunately, Marceau also does<br />\na good disappearing trick; after two<br />\nshows he was gone. Marceau played to<br />\nfull houses both times, but there were<br />\nstill not enough opportunities to see the<br />\nlegend perform. Hopkins was extremely<br />\nlucky to have had this opportunity. In<br />\nthis day of loud music, loud airplanes,<br />\nand loud clothing, it is gratifying to come<br />\nin contact with the quiet but worthy<br />\nMarcel Marceau.<br /><br />\nPAGE 16 / APRIL 18, 1980<br /><br />\nBaltimore's Literary Renaissance<br /><br />\nWriters Council Pulls All Together<br />\npredicts further resurgence of publication and literary activities in Baltimore<br />\nand<br />\nThe Maryland Writers Council due to the increasing influx of writers<br />\npublicamagazine<br />\nin<br />\ned<br />\nexperienc<br />\npeople<br />\na<br />\nis<br />\nPaul,<br />\nSt.<br />\n(MWC), located at 1110<br />\nan attractive<br />\nstate and corporately funded office that tion.
