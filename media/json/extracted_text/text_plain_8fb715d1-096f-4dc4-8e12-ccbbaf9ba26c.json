XV, NO. 12.<br />\n<br />\nA MILLION DOLLARS<br />\nMoney on Hand Before the<br />\nTime Was Up.<br />\nHOMEWOOD SOON A REALITY<br />\nLarge Gifts Received Toward<br />\nthe Second Million.<br />\nCommittee Receives More Than Enough<br />\nPledges to Secure Education Board's<br />\nGift \u2014A Strong Effort to be Made<br />\nto Secure Remaining Sum<br />\nWithin a Few Months.<br />\n<br />\nThe fund is half completed! The<br />\nsum of $125,000, which was still<br />\nlacking at the last publication of<br />\nTHF, NEWS-LETTER, has been subscribed, and the General Education<br />\nBoard's gift has been secured. On<br />\nThursday evening, two days before<br />\nthe allotted time was up, Mr.<br />\nFrench announced that the pledges ,<br />\nin hand totalled $812,193. The<br />\nsum in excess of $750,000 will be<br />\napplied on the second million. Several gifts, which rested on the condition of the completion of the first<br />\nmillion were now available. These<br />\nare:<br />\nMr. William H. Buckler<br />\nMrs. Thomas P. Strait<br />\nAnonymous<br />\n<br />\n$20,000<br />\nto,000<br />\n15,000<br />\n<br />\nMr. Buckler cabled his donation<br />\nfrom England. This makes the<br />\ntotal of the fund to date $1,107,193.<br />\nWith these three exceptions, the<br />\ncontributions during the past two<br />\nweeks were all small, and it is a<br />\nsplendid testimony as to the activity<br />\nof the committee that $19o,boo Wag<br />\nraised in ten days by subscriptions,<br />\nmost of which were less than $500.<br />\nThe alumni have responded generously and have helped to swell<br />\nthe fund considerably. The classes<br />\nof '92, '99, '02, and '05, gave more ,<br />\nthan $5,000 each.<br />\nThere was one subscription, however, which gave a great amount of<br />\npleasure to all interested in the University. .This was the donation by<br />\nthe Yale alumni residing in Maryland. In making this gift, they referred . to the intimate relations<br />\nwhich had existed between Johns<br />\nHopkins and Yale since the foundation of the former University. Dr.<br />\nGilman himself was a Yale man.<br />\nThere are now no less than fourteen<br />\nYale alumni on the Hopkins faculty.<br />\nSimilarly, there are a large number<br />\nof Hopkins men at Yale. Only last<br />\nyear Dr. C. M. Andrews was appointed, head of the department of<br />\nhistory at Yale. The good will<br />\nwhich is evidenced by this subscription is very gratifying.<br />\n<br />\nOn Thursday the subscriptions<br />\npoured in so rapidly from all over<br />\nthe State that it was impossible to<br />\ntabulate them for publication in the<br />\nevening papers. Three hundred individual contributors gave $80,000.<br />\nThis flood of pledges was in response to the appeal which was sent<br />\nbroadcast over the State earlier in<br />\nthe week. The surplus is applied<br />\nto the second million, so that there<br />\nremains but $900,000 to be secured<br />\nbefore Homewood is a reality.<br />\nThe General Education Board will<br />\ngive twenty-five cents for every<br />\nseventy-five cents in cash received<br />\nby the committee until the pledges<br />\nare all redeemed. As a large number of the pledges call for three<br />\nannual instalments it will probably<br />\nbe three years before the entire million dollars will be in the hands of<br />\nthe trustees. But this is no hindrance to the progress of work at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nALUMNI NOTES<br />\nDr. T. P.

In the first<br />\nplace the number of undergraduates<br />\nis about twenty-five per cent.<br />\ngreater than last year, and consequently there should be more candidates for the teams. Secondly,<br />\nall the athletic squads will start<br />\nwith an unusually large number of<br />\nveterans as a nucleus. Thirdly, the<br />\nmanagers of the various athletic<br />\nteams have been able to arrange<br />\nbetter schedules for the 1911 .seasons than ever heretofore. And,last,<br />\nbut not least, there will be an officially recognized Hopkins baseball<br />\nteam for the first time in many<br />\nyears.<br />\nCandidates for the Black and<br />\nBlue lacrosse team have been practicing regularly under Coach Meyer<br />\nfor the past month. The \"green\"<br />\nmembers of the squad are rapidly<br />\nlearning the rudimentary principles<br />\nof the game. Although their stickwork is not yet perfect, Coach<br />\nMeyer will begin in a few days<br />\nto drill the candidates in the Hopkins system of play. Captain Hulburt is especially anxious to win<br />\nback the championship of the southern division of the intercollegiate<br />\nlacrosse league, which Hopkins lost<br />\nlast spring for the first time in five<br />\nyears. Swarthmore, the present<br />\nholder of the championship, will<br />\nprobably be as last year, Hopkins'<br />\nmost formidable opponent. The<br />\nQuakers lost but two members of<br />\ntheir crack twelve, and are, therefore, likely to figure prominently in<br />\nthe contest for the coveted banner.<br />\nHopkins will play all the strongest<br />\nteams in the northern division, so<br />\nthat, if it wins all its games this<br />\nseason, it will have a clear title to<br />\nthe national championship.<br />\nOn the cindertrack the wearers<br />\nof the Black and Blue'hope to give<br />\na good account of themselves. The<br />\nfull strength of the squad is as<br />\nyet unknown, but in Captain Fulton, Horrax, Hunter, and Morton,<br />\nHopkins has suKe point winners.<br />\nThe track candidates were given a<br />\nrest during the holidays, but beginning this week they will get down<br />\nto daily work under Coach Kocker.<br />\nThe indoor season will begin in<br />\nFebruary, and the athletes will have<br />\nplenty of opportunity to win glory<br />\nfor Hopkins and for themselves.<br />\nThe dual meet between the sophomores and freshmen will come pff<br />\nnear the end of January, and this<br />\nwill serve as incentive for the sophs \u2022<br />\nand freshies to join the track squad.<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nThe sophomores have elected Billy<br />\nRay captain of their class trackteam, and the freshmen will probably elect their leader in a few<br />\ndays.<br />\nManager Sattler is arranging a<br />\nfine schedule for the baseball team.<br />\nIt includes games with University<br />\nof Pennsylvania, Columbia and some<br />\nother strong and well known nines.<br />\nIf baseball is a failure, it will not<br />\nbe on account of lack of good<br />\ngames. But it might be said right<br />\nhere that baseball is not going to<br />\nbe a failure. Captain Pieper has<br />\nheard from a large number of prospective candidates, many of whom<br />\nhave made reputations for themselves on their prep school and college nines. From present indications, baseball bids fair to become<br />\nmore popular than lacrosse.<br />\nThe gymnasium is to be equipped with basketball goals, and the<br />\nstudents who are fond of the game<br />\nwill soon have an opportunity of<br />\nplaying. Prof. Kistler has already<br />\narranged for a league among the<br />\nmembers of the freshman gymnasium class. There will be six teams<br />\nand the captains have already been.<br />\nelected. They will pick their teams<br />\nshortly. The other classes will probably organize quintets, and it is<br />\nquite possible that an interclass<br />\nleague may be formed. If the game<br />\narouses enough interest, Hopkins<br />\nwill probably have a regular varsity<br />\nteam next year.<br />\nBut lest we forget. The football<br />\nplayers have not been given their<br />\ncustomary blow-out. They deserve<br />\none as they made a splendid record<br />\non the gridiron. The players appreciate their \"H's\" and \"H. A. A's.\"<br />\nmuch more when they are presented<br />\nbefore a gathering of their fellow<br />\nstudents. Everybody has a good<br />\ntime and we ought to give the team<br />\ntheir blow-out even if it is a little<br />\nlate. Since the Athletic Association<br />\ndoes not see its way clear to financing such an entertainment, the student body should do it by individual<br />\nsubscription. Let's make arrangements for it at once.

The crowd at the<br />\nconcert was not as large as could<br />\nhave been desired, owing to several<br />\nrival attractions, but the audience<br />\nwas appreciative. The quartette<br />\nwas encored several times and<br />\n\"Stonie's'' medley made a hit. The<br />\nchorus sang two University songs<br />\nwith great effect.

XV, NO. 12.<br /><br />\nA MILLION DOLLARS<br />\nMoney on Hand Before the<br />\nTime Was Up.<br />\nHOMEWOOD SOON A REALITY<br />\nLarge Gifts Received Toward<br />\nthe Second Million.<br />\nCommittee Receives More Than Enough<br />\nPledges to Secure Education Board's<br />\nGift \u2014A Strong Effort to be Made<br />\nto Secure Remaining Sum<br />\nWithin a Few Months.<br /><br />\nThe fund is half completed! The<br />\nsum of $125,000, which was still<br />\nlacking at the last publication of<br />\nTHF, NEWS-LETTER, has been subscribed, and the General Education<br />\nBoard's gift has been secured. On<br />\nThursday evening, two days before<br />\nthe allotted time was up, Mr.<br />\nFrench announced that the pledges ,<br />\nin hand totalled $812,193. The<br />\nsum in excess of $750,000 will be<br />\napplied on the second million. Several gifts, which rested on the condition of the completion of the first<br />\nmillion were now available. These<br />\nare:<br />\nMr. William H. Buckler<br />\nMrs. Thomas P. Strait<br />\nAnonymous<br /><br />\n$20,000<br />\nto,000<br />\n15,000<br /><br />\nMr. Buckler cabled his donation<br />\nfrom England. This makes the<br />\ntotal of the fund to date $1,107,193.<br />\nWith these three exceptions, the<br />\ncontributions during the past two<br />\nweeks were all small, and it is a<br />\nsplendid testimony as to the activity<br />\nof the committee that $19o,boo Wag<br />\nraised in ten days by subscriptions,<br />\nmost of which were less than $500.<br />\nThe alumni have responded generously and have helped to swell<br />\nthe fund considerably. The classes<br />\nof '92, '99, '02, and '05, gave more ,<br />\nthan $5,000 each.<br />\nThere was one subscription, however, which gave a great amount of<br />\npleasure to all interested in the University. .This was the donation by<br />\nthe Yale alumni residing in Maryland. In making this gift, they referred . to the intimate relations<br />\nwhich had existed between Johns<br />\nHopkins and Yale since the foundation of the former University. Dr.<br />\nGilman himself was a Yale man.<br />\nThere are now no less than fourteen<br />\nYale alumni on the Hopkins faculty.<br />\nSimilarly, there are a large number<br />\nof Hopkins men at Yale. Only last<br />\nyear Dr. C. M. Andrews was appointed, head of the department of<br />\nhistory at Yale. The good will<br />\nwhich is evidenced by this subscription is very gratifying.<br /><br />\nOn Thursday the subscriptions<br />\npoured in so rapidly from all over<br />\nthe State that it was impossible to<br />\ntabulate them for publication in the<br />\nevening papers. Three hundred individual contributors gave $80,000.<br />\nThis flood of pledges was in response to the appeal which was sent<br />\nbroadcast over the State earlier in<br />\nthe week. The surplus is applied<br />\nto the second million, so that there<br />\nremains but $900,000 to be secured<br />\nbefore Homewood is a reality.<br />\nThe General Education Board will<br />\ngive twenty-five cents for every<br />\nseventy-five cents in cash received<br />\nby the committee until the pledges<br />\nare all redeemed. As a large number of the pledges call for three<br />\nannual instalments it will probably<br />\nbe three years before the entire million dollars will be in the hands of<br />\nthe trustees. But this is no hindrance to the progress of work at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nALUMNI NOTES<br />\nDr. T. P.

In the first<br />\nplace the number of undergraduates<br />\nis about twenty-five per cent.<br />\ngreater than last year, and consequently there should be more candidates for the teams. Secondly,<br />\nall the athletic squads will start<br />\nwith an unusually large number of<br />\nveterans as a nucleus. Thirdly, the<br />\nmanagers of the various athletic<br />\nteams have been able to arrange<br />\nbetter schedules for the 1911 .seasons than ever heretofore. And,last,<br />\nbut not least, there will be an officially recognized Hopkins baseball<br />\nteam for the first time in many<br />\nyears.<br />\nCandidates for the Black and<br />\nBlue lacrosse team have been practicing regularly under Coach Meyer<br />\nfor the past month. The \"green\"<br />\nmembers of the squad are rapidly<br />\nlearning the rudimentary principles<br />\nof the game. Although their stickwork is not yet perfect, Coach<br />\nMeyer will begin in a few days<br />\nto drill the candidates in the Hopkins system of play. Captain Hulburt is especially anxious to win<br />\nback the championship of the southern division of the intercollegiate<br />\nlacrosse league, which Hopkins lost<br />\nlast spring for the first time in five<br />\nyears. Swarthmore, the present<br />\nholder of the championship, will<br />\nprobably be as last year, Hopkins'<br />\nmost formidable opponent. The<br />\nQuakers lost but two members of<br />\ntheir crack twelve, and are, therefore, likely to figure prominently in<br />\nthe contest for the coveted banner.<br />\nHopkins will play all the strongest<br />\nteams in the northern division, so<br />\nthat, if it wins all its games this<br />\nseason, it will have a clear title to<br />\nthe national championship.<br />\nOn the cindertrack the wearers<br />\nof the Black and Blue'hope to give<br />\na good account of themselves. The<br />\nfull strength of the squad is as<br />\nyet unknown, but in Captain Fulton, Horrax, Hunter, and Morton,<br />\nHopkins has suKe point winners.<br />\nThe track candidates were given a<br />\nrest during the holidays, but beginning this week they will get down<br />\nto daily work under Coach Kocker.<br />\nThe indoor season will begin in<br />\nFebruary, and the athletes will have<br />\nplenty of opportunity to win glory<br />\nfor Hopkins and for themselves.<br />\nThe dual meet between the sophomores and freshmen will come pff<br />\nnear the end of January, and this<br />\nwill serve as incentive for the sophs \u2022<br />\nand freshies to join the track squad.<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nThe sophomores have elected Billy<br />\nRay captain of their class trackteam, and the freshmen will probably elect their leader in a few<br />\ndays.<br />\nManager Sattler is arranging a<br />\nfine schedule for the baseball team.<br />\nIt includes games with University<br />\nof Pennsylvania, Columbia and some<br />\nother strong and well known nines.<br />\nIf baseball is a failure, it will not<br />\nbe on account of lack of good<br />\ngames. But it might be said right<br />\nhere that baseball is not going to<br />\nbe a failure. Captain Pieper has<br />\nheard from a large number of prospective candidates, many of whom<br />\nhave made reputations for themselves on their prep school and college nines. From present indications, baseball bids fair to become<br />\nmore popular than lacrosse.<br />\nThe gymnasium is to be equipped with basketball goals, and the<br />\nstudents who are fond of the game<br />\nwill soon have an opportunity of<br />\nplaying. Prof. Kistler has already<br />\narranged for a league among the<br />\nmembers of the freshman gymnasium class. There will be six teams<br />\nand the captains have already been.<br />\nelected. They will pick their teams<br />\nshortly. The other classes will probably organize quintets, and it is<br />\nquite possible that an interclass<br />\nleague may be formed. If the game<br />\narouses enough interest, Hopkins<br />\nwill probably have a regular varsity<br />\nteam next year.<br />\nBut lest we forget. The football<br />\nplayers have not been given their<br />\ncustomary blow-out. They deserve<br />\none as they made a splendid record<br />\non the gridiron. The players appreciate their \"H's\" and \"H. A. A's.\"<br />\nmuch more when they are presented<br />\nbefore a gathering of their fellow<br />\nstudents. Everybody has a good<br />\ntime and we ought to give the team<br />\ntheir blow-out even if it is a little<br />\nlate. Since the Athletic Association<br />\ndoes not see its way clear to financing such an entertainment, the student body should do it by individual<br />\nsubscription. Let's make arrangements for it at once.
