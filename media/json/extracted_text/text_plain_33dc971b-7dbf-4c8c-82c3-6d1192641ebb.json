On Monday evening, the Committee on Student Affairs rejected a motion to proceed directly with the proposed referendum. On Tuesday Morning, April 21, Dr. John White tendered his resignation as Chairman of the<br />\nCommittee to Dean Kimball.<br />\n8.

Within the presently available machinery in the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences, the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs appears to be the most appropriate body for conducting such a<br />\ncanvass of opinion. I have therefore<br />\nasked Dean Kimball not to accept Dr.<br />\nWhite's resignation, and I earnestly<br />\ncall upon the Committee to fulfill its<br />\nobligation to the Arts and Sciences<br />\ncommunity to provide an orderly<br />\nmeans for that community as a whole<br />\n<br />\nUnder Gordon's plan the committee<br />\nwould have \"full authority to interpret<br />\nthe significance of the results and to determine the actual decision\" if the referendum proved inconclusive. This was<br />\nthe same proposal that the SAC deafeated<br />\nby a 5-4 vote Monday night.<br />\n\"In the light of this (Dr. Gordon's)<br />\nrequest,\" Dr. White declared, \"I will<br />\nhold off on the resubmission of my resignation.\"<br />\nThe approved resolution states that<br />\n\"there shall be no legitimate authority..<br />\nwhich can authorize military recruitment<br />\non campus, other than the opinion of a<br />\nsubstantial portion of the university community,\" as expressed by petition. In<br />\nother words, the burden for bringing<br />\nrecruiters on campus would be placed<br />\non those who want them.<br />\nThe committee requested Dr. Gordon<br />\nto respond to the resolution--accepting<br />\nor rejecting it --by Tuesday at noon.<br />\nEarlier in the day Monday, Dr. White<br />\nhad asked President Gordon to withdraw<br />\nthe University's court injunction and<br />\n\"allow the matter (of military recruitment) to be brought before the SAC...<br />\nthe regularly constituted University<br />\nchannel for the consideration of nonacademic matter.\"<br />\nGordon agreed and entrusted the SAC<br />\nwith the power to make a binding suba<br />\nstantive recommendation following<br />\nreferendum.<br />\nIn his pending letter of resignation,<br />\nWhite praised Gordon's \"willingness to<br />\nalter\" his \"previous position.\" He said<br />\nthat Gordon's actions \"represented a<br />\n<br />\nmajor series of concessions in the face<br />\nof legitimate student and faculty concern.\"<br />\nBecause the SAC did not accept Gordon's \"binding offer,\" he said, it is the<br />\nSAC \"which has refused to act as... a<br />\nchannel for free domocratic process.\"<br />\nThe committee's actions, he stated,<br />\n\"serve neither the best interests of the<br />\nUniversity as a whole, nor of the majority of its faculty or studPnt members.\"<br />\n<br />\nAt the committee meeting, White stated, \"There are fascists of the right and<br />\nthere are fascists of the left,\" He promised to \"fight them as long as I can\"<br />\nand pointed out that he would have resigned that morning if Gordon had not<br />\nproved flexible.<br />\nThis precipitated a hot exchange be:<br />\ntween committee members and visitors<br />\nin the crowded Garrett Room, and along<br />\nwith White's resignation, led to the resignation of Dr. John Mann from the<br />\ncommittee. In tendering his resignation,<br />\nMann declared that White's action \"destroys the effectiveness of this committee.\"<br />\nUndergraduate member Stuart Seidel<br />\nand Graduate Student Organization President Bob Cotter also resigned their<br />\nseats on the committee. In his letter of<br />\nresignation, Seidel states,\"I am no longer willing to particpate on a committee<br />\nthat is merely functioning to legitimize<br />\nlegislation that the President of the university wishes to see considered by student-faculty committees.\"<br />\n<br />\nDemands of the Strike Committee<br />\nI.

Volpe<br />\nConstruction Company has done extensive<br />\nhighway work. When Volpe was appointed Secretary of transportation he announced that he was selling his stock in<br />\norder to avoid a conflict of interests. Until the time he sold his stock, valued at<br />\n$1,000,000, Volpe was the largest shareholder in his company. Volpe's stock sale<br />\nmade his brother the largest shareholder<br />\nin the company.<br />\nThe John A. Volpe Construction Company also did extensive construction work<br />\nin Massachusetts when Volpe was governor of that state.<br />\n<br />\nCritics of the bill charge that<br />\nharrassment will increase from<br />\nthe police.

Volpe, Secretary of Transportation,<br />\nwill speak tonight in Shriver Hall.<br />\n<br />\nSome respects, but he lost any liberal<br />\nreputation he might have had on November 11, 1969. On that day, Volpe said, the<br />\nmoratorium was being organized by people who were \"communist or communist<br />\n-inspired\".

He first became governor in 1960 and served until he was<br />\ndefeated in 1962. In 1964 Volpe ran again<br />\nand was easily elected. He was reelected in 1966, and served until being appointed U. S. Secretary of Transportation.<br />\n<br />\nVolpe also fought against the construction of a jetport in the Everglades in<br />\nFlorida.

It was submitted to the<br />\nNews-Letter on Monday night.<br />\nI feel that the Hopkins Community should know<br />\nhow the President-elect of the Student -Council<br />\nfeels about the events of the last four days. There-fore I submit this statement reiterating much of<br />\nwhat I said Friday night.<br />\nFirst, military recruiting could be accomplished<br />\njust as effectively off campus. The Applied Physics Laboratory should be increasingly directed toward domestic programs aiming for aneventual total conversion to peaceful resource.<br />\nSecond, the recent demonstration regarding military recruiting on campus has escalated completely out of proportion to its significance. For example, no further recruitment will take place this<br />\nyear. In addition, the Marines have only recruited<br />\none person in two years. The demonstrators are<br />\nstraining at the gnat and swallowing the camel. Even<br />\nif military recruitment is forced off campus, how<br />\nwill APL be forced to strive for more peaceful<br />\ngoals? Even if APL is made more peace-oriented,<br />\n:.how can the rest of the University be directed<br />\ntoward more peceful projects such as combating<br />\nracism or rebuilding the ghetto? The real question<br />\nis the structure and purpose if this university<br />\nand how to effect its change. The real question<br />\nis University governance.<br />\n<br />\nbefore voting. Whether or not the issue is a moral<br />\none does not prevent it from being decided by<br />\nballot. In a democracy when we vote on a president, whether we uphold or reject a bill for abortion, we in a sense decide moral issues. The result of an election on a moral issue is the aggregate morality of the voters.<br />\nFifth, the injunction issued on Friday, patterned<br />\nafter the one used at Columbia is so broad that it<br />\nreeks of repression, intimidation, and unconstitutionality. I will work for the dissolution of the injunction or at least for narrowing its scope to<br />\ninclude only an injunction against the occupation<br />\nof Homewood House.<br />\neveryone<br />\nI will remain open-minded as I hope<br />\nanyone.<br />\nwith<br />\nissue<br />\nthe<br />\ndiscuss<br />\nwill.

First,<br />\nthat Dr. Gordon is personally opposed to eliminating oncampus recruiting. Second, that he has allowed his personal feelings to interfere with his performance as the<br />\nchief executive officer of this University. Third, that<br />\nthe<br />\nintransigence of his position has amplified already high<br />\ntensions on campus and, more than any other factor,<br />\nhas led to a call for a general strike.<br />\nIf Dr. Gordon had his way, he would ride the status<br />\nquo and delay the matter of a decision on military recruiting indefinitely. He has rejected or ignored all proposals<br />\n.that do not match his original referendum specifications<br />\nof last Friday. And he has made it clear that he will not<br />\naccept settlements of University governance questions<br />\n\"on the basis of one student vote equals one faculty vote.\"<br />\nPresident Gordon chose not to respond to the NewsLetter's demand for a binding one man-one vote studentfaculty referendum. With the News-Letter plan, as with<br />\nall other campus elections, a majority of those voting<br />\nwould be sufficient to determine a winner. Inexplicably,<br />\nDr. Gordon set up this election differently. He has repeatedly rejected the notion of plurality wins.<br />\nHe also chose to ignore a Monday night Student<br />\nAffairs Committee resolution banning recruiting on campus. This occurred only hours after he assigned the Committee the task of formulating a solution to the recruitment question. Obviously he had falsely hoped that the<br />\nSAC would approve his referendum plan. Under that<br />\nplan, the SAC would have had the power, in Gordon's<br />\nwords, \"to determine the actual decision if the referendum<br />\nitself did not provide a clear showing of campus community opinion.\" Both SC President John Guess and Grad<br />\nStudent Organization President Bob Cotter had previously<br />\ndeclined to appoint an ad hoc committee with the powers<br />\ndescribed above.<br />\nWhen the SAC passed its resolution banning recruiting, it requested a public \"yes or no\" answer from Dr.<br />\nGordon yesterday. Rather than respond, the President<br />\nelected to ignore a crowd of some 200 student and faculty<br />\nmembers waiting to receive his reply. Dr. Gordon handed<br />\na prepared statement to Dean-elect George Benton and<br />\nleft for a meeting which he obviously felt was more important. His statement, circumventing the question of the<br />\nSAC resolution, called again on the SAC to endorse and<br />\ntake charge of a referendum conducted on the President's<br />\nterms\u2014the very same proposition which the same committee had defeated the night before.<br />\nGordon has made many mistakes in the past several<br />\ndays and too few good judgments to counterbalance them.<br />\nHe must be lauded for one thing only--his removal of<br />\na<br />\nrestrictive court injunction. But that can only be classed<br />\nas the belated correction of a costly mistake which exacerbated tensions and mistrust between demonstrators<br />\nand the administration.<br />\nThere are now no longer any alternative \"legitimate\"<br />\nchannels to which the protestors can appeal. For the past<br />\ntwo years, all student \"victories\" including the calendar<br />\nreform issue, the Levering Hall budget controversy and<br />\nthe Freshman gym boycott have been won only when<br />\nstudents exerted pressure outside normal channels. On<br />\nthe other hand, the discipline code, for example, was<br />\ntaken through official channels all the way. The SAC<br />\nheld hearings and drew up a code, but, in the end, Dr.<br />\nGordon intervened with assumed authority and changed<br />\nit to his liking.<br />\nDemonstration after demonstration has been organized since Friday, but no substantive or procedural gains<br />\nhave been made. The only result has been frustration for<br />\nthose involved. Most of us, including those who do not see<br />\nthe recruitment issue as crucial, have been frustrated at one<br />\ntime or another at the hands of Hopkins. Whether the<br />\nproblem be parking, a lack of good courses or the elimination of classified research, most of the frustration<br />\ncan be traced to the lack of an adequate governance system.<br />\nThe administration's arrogance of power must be<br />\nmet by stern student-faculty action. A general strike can<br />\nbe used to redress our grievances with an audience that<br />\nwon't be able to afford not to listen. We endorse the<br />\nstatement of the Hopkins Strike Committee and urge all<br />\nstudents to boycott classes and participate in strike activities. We also call on the faculty to support their students<br />\nby canceling classes and taking part in the activities.<br />\n<br />\nBy EDWARD P. RADFORD<br />\nThe crisis of the environment constitutes a challenge to many of our most cherished American<br />\nbeliefs, such as the idea of technological progress<br />\nas a general good, the importance of individual<br />\ninitiative in economic development as an element<br />\nof freedom and the view that the general public<br />\nweal is adequately safeguarded from environ<br />\nmental degradation by existing forms of government.<br />\nChallenging of these beliefs is of recent origin,<br />\nand there is not only a lack of people technically<br />\nqualified to evaluate environmental problems but<br />\nalso there is a considerable inertia toward recognizing these problems in people today, many of<br />\nwhom grew up in a time when work toward an indefinitely expanding economy was an important<br />\narticle of faith. College students have a great opportunity, and even an obligation,to prepare themselves to assume major roles in the next decades<br />\nin dealing with these complicated issues.<br />\nTraining in science, engineering, sociology,<br />\nurban planning, coupled with a motivation to deal<br />\nwith immediate and long-range aspects of environmental protection will be needed. In addition we<br />\nwill need highly motivated people who can help<br />\nreview and revise the process of making public<br />\ndecisions with respect to environmental protection. Such governmental processes as exist now<br />\nare rudimentary and inadequate to the great tasks<br />\nahead.<br />\n<br />\nNo Simple Answers<br />\nStudents should not be misled into thinking that<br />\nsimple answers will suffice to check or reverse<br />\nenvironmental deterioration. It is unrealistic in<br />\nAmerica to expect population stabilization before<br />\nforty or fifty years, and in the meantime more<br />\nurgent matters must be faced immediately. A<br />\nmorally enlightened society depends, as a first<br />\nrequirement, on adequate food supplies and shelter, production and distribution of food and the<br />\ndesign and location of acceptable living space will<br />\ncarry environmental price tags that must be understood and kept to acceptable levels.<br />\nOur technologically advanced society depends<br />\nfor high productivity on a whole series of interlocking industries. Industrial alternatives less<br />\nhazardous to the environment must be sought, and<br />\nthe means and will for switching to better methods<br />\nof recycling limited resources must be found.<br />\nThere must be a way developed to safeguard individual freedom within a framework of group respons<br />\nibility, or \"mutual coercion, mutally agreed upon\"<br />\nas Garrett Hardin has stated.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the Teach-In programs this week I suggest you look for clarification of the following<br />\npoints as they relate to topics being discussed:<br />\n(a) What is the environmental significance of the<br />\nproblem? (i.e. for population, what is the minimum<br />\nof use of water, total solids, energy and the like<br />\nper capita with or without changes in living style?).<br />\n(b) What short-run solutions are possible at this<br />\ntime? (i.e. for air pollution, what methods are<br />\navailable and how effective can they be for lowering levels of particulates, sulfur dioxide, carbon<br />\nmonoxide, and other pollutants? (c) What longrange changes might bring about permanent solutions? (i.e. for solid wastes, what alternative can<br />\nbe developed to packaging practices and use of<br />\nmetals that would permit recycling and reclamation?) and (d) What political, economic and social<br />\nmodifications are required to provide the impetus<br />\nto bring about the changes in attitude necessa<br />\nry<br />\nto make environmental protection acceptable as<br />\na<br />\nbasis way of life? (i.e. what new approaches can<br />\nbe developed to solve the urban crisis,exempli<br />\nfied by urban blight, deteriorating services and<br />\ninadequate priorities of city government?)<br />\nThe Teach-In should be just a beginning. Faculty<br />\nmembers can contribute their expertise to public<br />\nhearings, commissions or other mechanisms<br />\nby<br />\nwhich answers to immediate problems are<br />\nbeing<br />\nreviewed by governmental agencies, or by<br />\nproviding a technical appraisal of environmental<br />\nquality<br />\nstandards. Members of the public can keep<br />\ninformed on legislative actions proposed, require<br />\nregulatory agencies to make information relatin<br />\ng to<br />\nenvironmental pollution public on a regular basis,<br />\nas well as being to develop political power<br />\nto meet<br />\nand solve the urban problems of housing, transportation, and urban redevelopment. Student can<br />\ns<br />\nplan their curricula to provide training pertine<br />\nnt<br />\nto the environmental problems, as well as assist<br />\nfaculty members in organizing new courses<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nFinally..,<br />\nFinally we all can make a commitment to a clean<br />\nenvironment, both by making clear that political<br />\nand economic pressures will be maintained to this<br />\nend, and by small decisions such as boycotting use<br />\nof non-returnable bottles or cans, and helping to<br />\ndevelop or improve park areas in the neighborhood.<br />\nWe need support from everyone.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Radford is a Professor of Environmental Medicine<br />\nat the Hopkins School of Public Health and Hygiene,<br />\nDepartment of Environmental Medicine and is a key<br />\norganizer oftomorrow's Environmental Teach-in.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editors<br />\nPARKING ACTION<br />\nTo-the Editors:<br />\nAs most of us who must drive to school already<br />\nknow, the parking situation on this campus is deplorableThe burden of the problem must be shouldered<br />\nby students and employees of the University alike,<br />\nbecause they receive the dregs of the parking<br />\nspaces, so to speak, after faculty and administration needs are taken care of. That so many individuals, students and employees receive so<br />\nfew<br />\nspaces, the ones left over after the faculty and the<br />\nadministration are all accounted for, and then have<br />\nto pay \"through the nose\" in fines and towing<br />\ncharges for illegally parking their cars on this<br />\ncampus merely to attend classes and jobs is highly<br />\nunjust,.<br />\nThe Parking and Traffic Committee has come up<br />\nwith an idea for solving the problem. Their idea<br />\nis the erection of a parking garage of which preliminary plans have been approved. Nevertheless,<br />\nthe final approval and the subsequent erection are<br />\na long way off and must be written off for the immediate future.<br />\nIf students had a truly significant input into<br />\nthe governing of this University, we could have<br />\na<br />\nsay in the type of facilities that are being<br />\nconned<br />\noff on us. We don't and everytime we try<br />\nto go<br />\nthrough established channels to get somethi<br />\nng<br />\ndone, meaning the vast bureaucracy of commit<br />\ntees that the President has surrounded<br />\nhimself<br />\nwith, we are co-opted and frustrated at every<br />\nturn.<br />\nThe only alternative left to us, so it seems, is<br />\nconfrontation and that is truly a sad state of affairs.<br />\n<br />\nThe Committee will discuss this proposal and<br />\nhopefully act on it this Thursday, April 23.<br />\nAs a show of force, I am asking<br />\nyou to refuse<br />\nto pay any fines for traffic violatio<br />\nns, boycott<br />\nthem, and send all tickets that you might<br />\nhave by<br />\ncampus mail to the secretary of the Parking<br />\nand<br />\nTraffic Committee, William Campbel<br />\nl, in Whitehead Hall.<br />\nHarry M. Singleton<br />\n<br />\nPROTEST AND NAZIISM<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nLincoln Gordon has likened our desire to decide<br />\nthe issue of campus recruiters on a moral basis<br />\nrather than by referendum to Naziism. Lincoln<br />\nGordon should either do his homework if he does<br />\n\u2022<br />\nnot know better, or, if he does, stop<br />\nlying.<br />\nThe differences. between our movement and<br />\nNaziism are as follows: 1.)

I am grieved<br />\nto report on the failure of Hopkin's recent attempt to enter the<br />\navant-garde.<br />\nThat Hopkins attempted to<br />\nstage such a contemporary production is commendable, that it<br />\nwould turn into such a dismal<br />\nfiasco was entirely predictable.<br />\nThe play was obviously the work<br />\nof amateurs, not especially talented amateurs at that.<br />\nIt is really inaccurate to call<br />\nthe play's producers amateurs,<br />\nsince a little less than a year ago<br />\nHopkins produced their first play,<br />\nentitled \"The Occupation of Hom wood House\", which some of you<br />\nmay have seen. That work, however, had such a limited run,<br />\nbefore such scant audiences, and<br />\nwas so obviously an artificial<br />\nattempt at spontaneity, that it<br />\nwould be unfair to judge anyone<br />\non the basis of that performance.<br />\n<br />\nThe character of Dr. Gordon,<br />\nthe college president, was weak<br />\nto the point of absurdity. College<br />\npresidents haven't acted like him<br />\nsince 1950. The idea of giving<br />\nhim State Department connections to add a sinister touch to<br />\nthe proceedings is simply contrived and unbelievable. The<br />\nwhole portrayal of Gordon as a<br />\nCold War Diplomat on a College<br />\nCampus is just too much to stomach; it is a contemporary play,<br />\nyet the college president is obviously of another age. Men like<br />\nhim have gone the way of the<br />\ndinosaur; why is it that the playwrights have not grasped this<br />\nfact?<br />\n<br />\nmerely from reading the date<br />\non their local' newspaper, that<br />\nthis is 1970. If they would read<br />\neven more of the paper, they<br />\nwould discover that in this age<br />\nof bomb factories, armed insurrections, and Weathermen, radicals and liberals simply do not<br />\nturn tail and run at the sight of<br />\nan injunction.<br />\n<br />\nThe Setting<br />\nThe overall setting of the play<br />\nwas a magnificient idea. Picture<br />\n<br />\nreviewer, enabling him to duck<br />\ndownstairs and grab a bite to<br />\neat. This may, in fact, have been<br />\n<br />\nThe Answer<br />\nThis may, in fact, have been the<br />\nunderlying reasons for the scene<br />\nchange. I would think, however,<br />\nthat both revolutions and plays<br />\nought to be directed by something<br />\n<br />\nwas relegated to a symbolic rip<br />\nand repair of the sign.<br />\nIf the play contained all of<br />\nthese old favorites and the playwrights' standby scenes, why,you<br />\nmight rightly ask, did the play<br />\nfail so miserably, or at least<br />\nstraggle so horrendoitsly towards<br />\nits conclusion?<br />\nThe answer must lie in the<br />\n;reality of this being a new play<br />\nbefore a new audience than has<br />\nnormally been attempted. New<br />\n<br />\nUp To 1964<br />\n<br />\nThe radicals were slightly<br />\nmore believable, but only because<br />\nthey were slightly more up to<br />\ndate - 1964.

I would<br />\nimagine that there may still be<br />\nsome individuals on campus who<br />\nthink like that, but in a position<br />\nof leadership?

The original idea was<br />\nthen to have the one to two<br />\nhundred actors wander from<br />\ncampus scene, bringing to mind<br />\nduring these days of Passover,<br />\nthe Jewish Nation wandering for<br />\n40 years in the desert of Sinai.<br />\nAn interesting idea, but a failure in practice. Scene changes<br />\ncame when they shouldn't have,<br />\ndidn't come when they should<br />\nhave, and eventually became simply mindlessly repetitious.<br />\nThere seemed to be no reason<br />\nfor the rapid scene change at<br />\nthe end of act 1 from the steps<br />\nof Homewood House to a room<br />\nin Levering Hall. Though it did<br />\ncome at a good time for this<br />\n<br />\nmore lofty than a rumbling gut.<br />\nAnd then the play got bogged<br />\ndown on the lawn in front of Homewood House.

PETER<br />\nJohns Hopkins baseball, having long<br />\ntaken a back seat to lacrosse in the spring,<br />\nhas come into its own this season. Hitting<br />\nthe ball unbelievably well, Hopkins' Blue<br />\nJays now enjoy a 5-1 record. The five<br />\nwins are more than the Blue Jays had all<br />\nlast season when they compiled a dismal<br />\n4-16 record.<br />\nUnder first year coach Hal Thorne the<br />\nBlue Jays have only lost one game, that<br />\none in twelve innings after losing a 7-0<br />\nlead. Coach Thorne thinks that the difference has been all in the attitude of this<br />\nyear's ballclub. Thorne thinks that this<br />\ncould be the key to how well the club will<br />\ndo the rest of the season.<br />\n<br />\nTremendous Hitting<br />\nHopkins hitters have been hitting at a<br />\nphenomenal clip, as their .297 team batting average indicates. Leading the batsmen for Hopkins are co-captains Bob Sla-<br />\n<br />\ncum and Glenn Deuchler, hitting.370 and<br />\n.423 respectively. Both Slacum and<br />\nDeuchler are in the outfield. First baseman, Steve Rach, is batting at .407.<br />\nSlacum leads in the RBI departmentwith<br />\nnine, while Deuchler is in second place<br />\nwith eight.<br />\nAlthough the scores of Hopkins' victories would indicate a weak pitching<br />\nstaff, such was not the case. \"The tight<br />\nschedule, due to the weather we have experienced, has been pretty tough on our<br />\npitching staff so far, but we've been getting enough runs to win and that's what\u2022<br />\ncounts. With proper rest, we have an<br />\nexcellent hurling staff,\" Thorne says.<br />\nThe leading Blue Jay hurlers are Dave<br />\nHoffman, Brice Dowell, and Rich Thielke.<br />\nHoffman leads the hurlers with a 2-0<br />\nrecord and a 3.68 earned run average.<br />\n<br />\nFewer Errors<br />\nPerhaps one of the most important differences in the Blue Jay record this year<br />\nhas been the performance of the team on<br />\n<br />\nthe field. Hopkins had made far less<br />\nerrors in the field than in years past,and<br />\nof course their record bears that out.<br />\nLast week saw Hopkins win all three<br />\nof their ballgames. The Blue Jays beat<br />\nTowson State last Thursday, 7-3. The<br />\nTigers are rated co-favorites alongwith<br />\nWestern Maryland to win the MasonDixon title. Prior to their loss to Hopkins<br />\nthey had an 8-2 record, with both of their<br />\nlosses coming against a strong Duke<br />\nUniversity ballclub. In that game,the big<br />\nfive-run seventh was highlighted by Glenn<br />\nDeuchler's three - run home run to knot<br />\nthe score.<br />\nLoyola's Greyhounds were next to fall<br />\nagainst Hopkins. Loyola had beaten Hopkins the last four times they had met over<br />\na span of two years. Loyola earlier this<br />\nyear won a decisive ballgame over<br />\nGeorgetown, 14 - 2. In this game, played<br />\nFriday, Steve Rach, singling with basesloaded in the bottom of the ninth, won the<br />\nball game for Hopkins, 10-9.<br />\nThen on Saturday, the Blue Jays handed<br />\nUrsinus a 16 - 14 loss. Ursinus had the day<br />\n<br />\nbefore beaten Mason-Dixon co-favorite,<br />\nWestern Maryland, 11-2. Both ballclubs<br />\nhad pretty much exhausted their pitching<br />\nstaffs, but Hopkins' superior hitting was<br />\nthe key in the slugfest, Key defensive<br />\nplays by Mike Abrams,a three-run home<br />\nrun by Bob Slacum, and a four for five<br />\nday at the plate, along with four runs<br />\nscored by Dennis O'Neill, highlighted the<br />\nSaturday game.<br />\n<br />\nThorne Optimistic<br />\nAsked about the rest of the season<br />\nThorne had this to say: \"I think we have<br />\nAn excellent ballclub. If we continue to<br />\nwork on our fundamentals and cut down<br />\neven more on our errors, there's no<br />\ntelling how far we'll go.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays have another heavy schedule this week with four games on tap.

On Monday evening, the Committee on Student Affairs rejected a motion to proceed directly with the proposed referendum. On Tuesday Morning, April 21, Dr. John White tendered his resignation as Chairman of the<br />\nCommittee to Dean Kimball.<br />\n8.

Within the presently available machinery in the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences, the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs appears to be the most appropriate body for conducting such a<br />\ncanvass of opinion. I have therefore<br />\nasked Dean Kimball not to accept Dr.<br />\nWhite's resignation, and I earnestly<br />\ncall upon the Committee to fulfill its<br />\nobligation to the Arts and Sciences<br />\ncommunity to provide an orderly<br />\nmeans for that community as a whole<br /><br />\nUnder Gordon's plan the committee<br />\nwould have \"full authority to interpret<br />\nthe significance of the results and to determine the actual decision\" if the referendum proved inconclusive. This was<br />\nthe same proposal that the SAC deafeated<br />\nby a 5-4 vote Monday night.<br />\n\"In the light of this (Dr. Gordon's)<br />\nrequest,\" Dr. White declared, \"I will<br />\nhold off on the resubmission of my resignation.\"<br />\nThe approved resolution states that<br />\n\"there shall be no legitimate authority..<br />\nwhich can authorize military recruitment<br />\non campus, other than the opinion of a<br />\nsubstantial portion of the university community,\" as expressed by petition. In<br />\nother words, the burden for bringing<br />\nrecruiters on campus would be placed<br />\non those who want them.<br />\nThe committee requested Dr. Gordon<br />\nto respond to the resolution--accepting<br />\nor rejecting it --by Tuesday at noon.<br />\nEarlier in the day Monday, Dr. White<br />\nhad asked President Gordon to withdraw<br />\nthe University's court injunction and<br />\n\"allow the matter (of military recruitment) to be brought before the SAC...<br />\nthe regularly constituted University<br />\nchannel for the consideration of nonacademic matter.\"<br />\nGordon agreed and entrusted the SAC<br />\nwith the power to make a binding suba<br />\nstantive recommendation following<br />\nreferendum.<br />\nIn his pending letter of resignation,<br />\nWhite praised Gordon's \"willingness to<br />\nalter\" his \"previous position.\" He said<br />\nthat Gordon's actions \"represented a<br /><br />\nmajor series of concessions in the face<br />\nof legitimate student and faculty concern.\"<br />\nBecause the SAC did not accept Gordon's \"binding offer,\" he said, it is the<br />\nSAC \"which has refused to act as... a<br />\nchannel for free domocratic process.\"<br />\nThe committee's actions, he stated,<br />\n\"serve neither the best interests of the<br />\nUniversity as a whole, nor of the majority of its faculty or studPnt members.\"<br /><br />\nAt the committee meeting, White stated, \"There are fascists of the right and<br />\nthere are fascists of the left,\" He promised to \"fight them as long as I can\"<br />\nand pointed out that he would have resigned that morning if Gordon had not<br />\nproved flexible.<br />\nThis precipitated a hot exchange be:<br />\ntween committee members and visitors<br />\nin the crowded Garrett Room, and along<br />\nwith White's resignation, led to the resignation of Dr. John Mann from the<br />\ncommittee. In tendering his resignation,<br />\nMann declared that White's action \"destroys the effectiveness of this committee.\"<br />\nUndergraduate member Stuart Seidel<br />\nand Graduate Student Organization President Bob Cotter also resigned their<br />\nseats on the committee.

It was submitted to the<br />\nNews-Letter on Monday night.<br />\nI feel that the Hopkins Community should know<br />\nhow the President-elect of the Student -Council<br />\nfeels about the events of the last four days. There-fore I submit this statement reiterating much of<br />\nwhat I said Friday night.<br />\nFirst, military recruiting could be accomplished<br />\njust as effectively off campus. The Applied Physics Laboratory should be increasingly directed toward domestic programs aiming for aneventual total conversion to peaceful resource.<br />\nSecond, the recent demonstration regarding military recruiting on campus has escalated completely out of proportion to its significance. For example, no further recruitment will take place this<br />\nyear. In addition, the Marines have only recruited<br />\none person in two years. The demonstrators are<br />\nstraining at the gnat and swallowing the camel. Even<br />\nif military recruitment is forced off campus, how<br />\nwill APL be forced to strive for more peaceful<br />\ngoals? Even if APL is made more peace-oriented,<br />\n:.how can the rest of the University be directed<br />\ntoward more peceful projects such as combating<br />\nracism or rebuilding the ghetto? The real question<br />\nis the structure and purpose if this university<br />\nand how to effect its change. The real question<br />\nis University governance.<br /><br />\nbefore voting. Whether or not the issue is a moral<br />\none does not prevent it from being decided by<br />\nballot. In a democracy when we vote on a president, whether we uphold or reject a bill for abortion, we in a sense decide moral issues. The result of an election on a moral issue is the aggregate morality of the voters.<br />\nFifth, the injunction issued on Friday, patterned<br />\nafter the one used at Columbia is so broad that it<br />\nreeks of repression, intimidation, and unconstitutionality. I will work for the dissolution of the injunction or at least for narrowing its scope to<br />\ninclude only an injunction against the occupation<br />\nof Homewood House.<br />\neveryone<br />\nI will remain open-minded as I hope<br />\nanyone.<br />\nwith<br />\nissue<br />\nthe<br />\ndiscuss<br />\nwill.

First,<br />\nthat Dr. Gordon is personally opposed to eliminating oncampus recruiting. Second, that he has allowed his personal feelings to interfere with his performance as the<br />\nchief executive officer of this University. Third, that<br />\nthe<br />\nintransigence of his position has amplified already high<br />\ntensions on campus and, more than any other factor,<br />\nhas led to a call for a general strike.<br />\nIf Dr. Gordon had his way, he would ride the status<br />\nquo and delay the matter of a decision on military recruiting indefinitely. He has rejected or ignored all proposals<br />\n.that do not match his original referendum specifications<br />\nof last Friday. And he has made it clear that he will not<br />\naccept settlements of University governance questions<br />\n\"on the basis of one student vote equals one faculty vote.\"<br />\nPresident Gordon chose not to respond to the NewsLetter's demand for a binding one man-one vote studentfaculty referendum. With the News-Letter plan, as with<br />\nall other campus elections, a majority of those voting<br />\nwould be sufficient to determine a winner. Inexplicably,<br />\nDr. Gordon set up this election differently. He has repeatedly rejected the notion of plurality wins.<br />\nHe also chose to ignore a Monday night Student<br />\nAffairs Committee resolution banning recruiting on campus. This occurred only hours after he assigned the Committee the task of formulating a solution to the recruitment question. Obviously he had falsely hoped that the<br />\nSAC would approve his referendum plan. Under that<br />\nplan, the SAC would have had the power, in Gordon's<br />\nwords, \"to determine the actual decision if the referendum<br />\nitself did not provide a clear showing of campus community opinion.\" Both SC President John Guess and Grad<br />\nStudent Organization President Bob Cotter had previously<br />\ndeclined to appoint an ad hoc committee with the powers<br />\ndescribed above.<br />\nWhen the SAC passed its resolution banning recruiting, it requested a public \"yes or no\" answer from Dr.<br />\nGordon yesterday. Rather than respond, the President<br />\nelected to ignore a crowd of some 200 student and faculty<br />\nmembers waiting to receive his reply. Dr. Gordon handed<br />\na prepared statement to Dean-elect George Benton and<br />\nleft for a meeting which he obviously felt was more important. His statement, circumventing the question of the<br />\nSAC resolution, called again on the SAC to endorse and<br />\ntake charge of a referendum conducted on the President's<br />\nterms\u2014the very same proposition which the same committee had defeated the night before.<br />\nGordon has made many mistakes in the past several<br />\ndays and too few good judgments to counterbalance them.<br />\nHe must be lauded for one thing only--his removal of<br />\na<br />\nrestrictive court injunction. But that can only be classed<br />\nas the belated correction of a costly mistake which exacerbated tensions and mistrust between demonstrators<br />\nand the administration.<br />\nThere are now no longer any alternative \"legitimate\"<br />\nchannels to which the protestors can appeal. For the past<br />\ntwo years, all student \"victories\" including the calendar<br />\nreform issue, the Levering Hall budget controversy and<br />\nthe Freshman gym boycott have been won only when<br />\nstudents exerted pressure outside normal channels. On<br />\nthe other hand, the discipline code, for example, was<br />\ntaken through official channels all the way. The SAC<br />\nheld hearings and drew up a code, but, in the end, Dr.<br />\nGordon intervened with assumed authority and changed<br />\nit to his liking.<br />\nDemonstration after demonstration has been organized since Friday, but no substantive or procedural gains<br />\nhave been made. The only result has been frustration for<br />\nthose involved. Most of us, including those who do not see<br />\nthe recruitment issue as crucial, have been frustrated at one<br />\ntime or another at the hands of Hopkins. Whether the<br />\nproblem be parking, a lack of good courses or the elimination of classified research, most of the frustration<br />\ncan be traced to the lack of an adequate governance system.<br />\nThe administration's arrogance of power must be<br />\nmet by stern student-faculty action. A general strike can<br />\nbe used to redress our grievances with an audience that<br />\nwon't be able to afford not to listen. We endorse the<br />\nstatement of the Hopkins Strike Committee and urge all<br />\nstudents to boycott classes and participate in strike activities. We also call on the faculty to support their students<br />\nby canceling classes and taking part in the activities.<br /><br />\nBy EDWARD P. RADFORD<br />\nThe crisis of the environment constitutes a challenge to many of our most cherished American<br />\nbeliefs, such as the idea of technological progress<br />\nas a general good, the importance of individual<br />\ninitiative in economic development as an element<br />\nof freedom and the view that the general public<br />\nweal is adequately safeguarded from environ<br />\nmental degradation by existing forms of government.<br />\nChallenging of these beliefs is of recent origin,<br />\nand there is not only a lack of people technically<br />\nqualified to evaluate environmental problems but<br />\nalso there is a considerable inertia toward recognizing these problems in people today, many of<br />\nwhom grew up in a time when work toward an indefinitely expanding economy was an important<br />\narticle of faith. College students have a great opportunity, and even an obligation,to prepare themselves to assume major roles in the next decades<br />\nin dealing with these complicated issues.<br />\nTraining in science, engineering, sociology,<br />\nurban planning, coupled with a motivation to deal<br />\nwith immediate and long-range aspects of environmental protection will be needed. In addition we<br />\nwill need highly motivated people who can help<br />\nreview and revise the process of making public<br />\ndecisions with respect to environmental protection. Such governmental processes as exist now<br />\nare rudimentary and inadequate to the great tasks<br />\nahead.<br /><br />\nNo Simple Answers<br />\nStudents should not be misled into thinking that<br />\nsimple answers will suffice to check or reverse<br />\nenvironmental deterioration. It is unrealistic in<br />\nAmerica to expect population stabilization before<br />\nforty or fifty years, and in the meantime more<br />\nurgent matters must be faced immediately. A<br />\nmorally enlightened society depends, as a first<br />\nrequirement, on adequate food supplies and shelter, production and distribution of food and the<br />\ndesign and location of acceptable living space will<br />\ncarry environmental price tags that must be understood and kept to acceptable levels.<br />\nOur technologically advanced society depends<br />\nfor high productivity on a whole series of interlocking industries. Industrial alternatives less<br />\nhazardous to the environment must be sought, and<br />\nthe means and will for switching to better methods<br />\nof recycling limited resources must be found.<br />\nThere must be a way developed to safeguard individual freedom within a framework of group respons<br />\nibility, or \"mutual coercion, mutally agreed upon\"<br />\nas Garrett Hardin has stated.<br /><br />\nDuring the Teach-In programs this week I suggest you look for clarification of the following<br />\npoints as they relate to topics being discussed:<br />\n(a) What is the environmental significance of the<br />\nproblem? (i.e. for population, what is the minimum<br />\nof use of water, total solids, energy and the like<br />\nper capita with or without changes in living style?).<br />\n(b) What short-run solutions are possible at this<br />\ntime? (i.e. for air pollution, what methods are<br />\navailable and how effective can they be for lowering levels of particulates, sulfur dioxide, carbon<br />\nmonoxide, and other pollutants? (c) What longrange changes might bring about permanent solutions? (i.e. for solid wastes, what alternative can<br />\nbe developed to packaging practices and use of<br />\nmetals that would permit recycling and reclamation?) and (d) What political, economic and social<br />\nmodifications are required to provide the impetus<br />\nto bring about the changes in attitude necessa<br />\nry<br />\nto make environmental protection acceptable as<br />\na<br />\nbasis way of life? (i.e. what new approaches can<br />\nbe developed to solve the urban crisis,exempli<br />\nfied by urban blight, deteriorating services and<br />\ninadequate priorities of city government?)<br />\nThe Teach-In should be just a beginning. Faculty<br />\nmembers can contribute their expertise to public<br />\nhearings, commissions or other mechanisms<br />\nby<br />\nwhich answers to immediate problems are<br />\nbeing<br />\nreviewed by governmental agencies, or by<br />\nproviding a technical appraisal of environmental<br />\nquality<br />\nstandards. Members of the public can keep<br />\ninformed on legislative actions proposed, require<br />\nregulatory agencies to make information relatin<br />\ng to<br />\nenvironmental pollution public on a regular basis,<br />\nas well as being to develop political power<br />\nto meet<br />\nand solve the urban problems of housing, transportation, and urban redevelopment. Student can<br />\ns<br />\nplan their curricula to provide training pertine<br />\nnt<br />\nto the environmental problems, as well as assist<br />\nfaculty members in organizing new courses<br />\n.<br /><br />\nFinally..,<br />\nFinally we all can make a commitment to a clean<br />\nenvironment, both by making clear that political<br />\nand economic pressures will be maintained to this<br />\nend, and by small decisions such as boycotting use<br />\nof non-returnable bottles or cans, and helping to<br />\ndevelop or improve park areas in the neighborhood.<br />\nWe need support from everyone.<br /><br />\nDr. Radford is a Professor of Environmental Medicine<br />\nat the Hopkins School of Public Health and Hygiene,<br />\nDepartment of Environmental Medicine and is a key<br />\norganizer oftomorrow's Environmental Teach-in.<br /><br />\nletters to the editors<br />\nPARKING ACTION<br />\nTo-the Editors:<br />\nAs most of us who must drive to school already<br />\nknow, the parking situation on this campus is deplorableThe burden of the problem must be shouldered<br />\nby students and employees of the University alike,<br />\nbecause they receive the dregs of the parking<br />\nspaces, so to speak, after faculty and administration needs are taken care of. That so many individuals, students and employees receive so<br />\nfew<br />\nspaces, the ones left over after the faculty and the<br />\nadministration are all accounted for, and then have<br />\nto pay \"through the nose\" in fines and towing<br />\ncharges for illegally parking their cars on this<br />\ncampus merely to attend classes and jobs is highly<br />\nunjust,.<br />\nThe Parking and Traffic Committee has come up<br />\nwith an idea for solving the problem. Their idea<br />\nis the erection of a parking garage of which preliminary plans have been approved. Nevertheless,<br />\nthe final approval and the subsequent erection are<br />\na long way off and must be written off for the immediate future.<br />\nIf students had a truly significant input into<br />\nthe governing of this University, we could have<br />\na<br />\nsay in the type of facilities that are being<br />\nconned<br />\noff on us. We don't and everytime we try<br />\nto go<br />\nthrough established channels to get somethi<br />\nng<br />\ndone, meaning the vast bureaucracy of commit<br />\ntees that the President has surrounded<br />\nhimself<br />\nwith, we are co-opted and frustrated at every<br />\nturn.<br />\nThe only alternative left to us, so it seems, is<br />\nconfrontation and that is truly a sad state of affairs.<br /><br />\nThe Committee will discuss this proposal and<br />\nhopefully act on it this Thursday, April 23.<br />\nAs a show of force, I am asking<br />\nyou to refuse<br />\nto pay any fines for traffic violatio<br />\nns, boycott<br />\nthem, and send all tickets that you might<br />\nhave by<br />\ncampus mail to the secretary of the Parking<br />\nand<br />\nTraffic Committee, William Campbel<br />\nl, in Whitehead Hall.<br />\nHarry M. Singleton<br /><br />\nPROTEST AND NAZIISM<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nLincoln Gordon has likened our desire to decide<br />\nthe issue of campus recruiters on a moral basis<br />\nrather than by referendum to Naziism. Lincoln<br />\nGordon should either do his homework if he does<br />\n\u2022<br />\nnot know better, or, if he does, stop<br />\nlying.<br />\nThe differences. between our movement and<br />\nNaziism are as follows: 1.) The Nazis sought<br />\nto<br />\nmilitarize the country. We seek to demilitarize<br />\nthe campus. 2.) The Nazis believed in a master<br />\nrace. On the contrary, we support the right<br />\nof<br />\nall people, including Vietnamese, blacks,<br />\nother<br />\nnon-white and/or non-American peoples, as well<br />\nas women, to self-determination. 3.) If we can<br />\nbe likened to anybody in Nazi Germany, it would<br />\nhave to he to those who dared to oppose Hitler,<br />\nthe war machine and a government-sponso<br />\nred<br />\narms industry.<br />\nNote also that Hitler too used democracy when<br />\nhe saw fit and discarded it when convenient(after<br />\nhe seized power).<br />\nFrederick L.

I am grieved<br />\nto report on the failure of Hopkin's recent attempt to enter the<br />\navant-garde.<br />\nThat Hopkins attempted to<br />\nstage such a contemporary production is commendable, that it<br />\nwould turn into such a dismal<br />\nfiasco was entirely predictable.<br />\nThe play was obviously the work<br />\nof amateurs, not especially talented amateurs at that.<br />\nIt is really inaccurate to call<br />\nthe play's producers amateurs,<br />\nsince a little less than a year ago<br />\nHopkins produced their first play,<br />\nentitled \"The Occupation of Hom wood House\", which some of you<br />\nmay have seen. That work, however, had such a limited run,<br />\nbefore such scant audiences, and<br />\nwas so obviously an artificial<br />\nattempt at spontaneity, that it<br />\nwould be unfair to judge anyone<br />\non the basis of that performance.<br /><br />\nThe character of Dr. Gordon,<br />\nthe college president, was weak<br />\nto the point of absurdity. College<br />\npresidents haven't acted like him<br />\nsince 1950. The idea of giving<br />\nhim State Department connections to add a sinister touch to<br />\nthe proceedings is simply contrived and unbelievable. The<br />\nwhole portrayal of Gordon as a<br />\nCold War Diplomat on a College<br />\nCampus is just too much to stomach; it is a contemporary play,<br />\nyet the college president is obviously of another age. Men like<br />\nhim have gone the way of the<br />\ndinosaur; why is it that the playwrights have not grasped this<br />\nfact?<br /><br />\nmerely from reading the date<br />\non their local' newspaper, that<br />\nthis is 1970. If they would read<br />\neven more of the paper, they<br />\nwould discover that in this age<br />\nof bomb factories, armed insurrections, and Weathermen, radicals and liberals simply do not<br />\nturn tail and run at the sight of<br />\nan injunction.<br /><br />\nThe Setting<br />\nThe overall setting of the play<br />\nwas a magnificient idea.

This may, in fact, have been<br /><br />\nThe Answer<br />\nThis may, in fact, have been the<br />\nunderlying reasons for the scene<br />\nchange. I would think, however,<br />\nthat both revolutions and plays<br />\nought to be directed by something<br /><br />\nwas relegated to a symbolic rip<br />\nand repair of the sign.<br />\nIf the play contained all of<br />\nthese old favorites and the playwrights' standby scenes, why,you<br />\nmight rightly ask, did the play<br />\nfail so miserably, or at least<br />\nstraggle so horrendoitsly towards<br />\nits conclusion?<br />\nThe answer must lie in the<br />\n;reality of this being a new play<br />\nbefore a new audience than has<br />\nnormally been attempted. New<br /><br />\nUp To 1964<br /><br />\nThe radicals were slightly<br />\nmore believable, but only because<br />\nthey were slightly more up to<br />\ndate - 1964. They are drawn as<br />\ndesparate figures, who toss and<br />\nturn in their sleep, muttering<br />\n\"Columbia had one, Harvard had<br />\none, why can't we?\". I would<br />\nimagine that there may still be<br />\nsome individuals on campus who<br />\nthink like that, but in a position<br />\nof leadership? It seems much<br />\nNumber Two<br />\nmore concerned with innovation<br />\nSo now we are confronted with<br />\nthan imitation.<br />\nthe authors' second attempt at<br />\nBut what finally destroyed any<br />\nplay writing.

It is<br />\nanything but card-carrying cardnot surprising that no one is willboard figures was the use by the<br />\ning to take credit for writing the<br />\nauthors of the old college-presiplay, but it is amazing that each<br />\ndent - arriving -in -the-nickscene is played as if, in fact,<br />\nof time-with-the injunction-tono one did or is planning in the<br />\nploy.<br />\nscare -off-the -radicals<br />\nnear future to, write it.<br />\nThis is done by having the colThis forces the charcters to<br />\nlege president arrive in the nick<br />\nwander through their parts in<br />\nof time with the injunction to<br />\nwhat appears to be a mindless<br />\nscare off the radicals.

The original idea was<br />\nthen to have the one to two<br />\nhundred actors wander from<br />\ncampus scene, bringing to mind<br />\nduring these days of Passover,<br />\nthe Jewish Nation wandering for<br />\n40 years in the desert of Sinai.<br />\nAn interesting idea, but a failure in practice. Scene changes<br />\ncame when they shouldn't have,<br />\ndidn't come when they should<br />\nhave, and eventually became simply mindlessly repetitious.<br />\nThere seemed to be no reason<br />\nfor the rapid scene change at<br />\nthe end of act 1 from the steps<br />\nof Homewood House to a room<br />\nin Levering Hall.

PETER<br />\nJohns Hopkins baseball, having long<br />\ntaken a back seat to lacrosse in the spring,<br />\nhas come into its own this season. Hitting<br />\nthe ball unbelievably well, Hopkins' Blue<br />\nJays now enjoy a 5-1 record. The five<br />\nwins are more than the Blue Jays had all<br />\nlast season when they compiled a dismal<br />\n4-16 record.<br />\nUnder first year coach Hal Thorne the<br />\nBlue Jays have only lost one game, that<br />\none in twelve innings after losing a 7-0<br />\nlead. Coach Thorne thinks that the difference has been all in the attitude of this<br />\nyear's ballclub. Thorne thinks that this<br />\ncould be the key to how well the club will<br />\ndo the rest of the season.<br /><br />\nTremendous Hitting<br />\nHopkins hitters have been hitting at a<br />\nphenomenal clip, as their .297 team batting average indicates. Leading the batsmen for Hopkins are co-captains Bob Sla-<br /><br />\ncum and Glenn Deuchler, hitting.370 and<br />\n.423 respectively. Both Slacum and<br />\nDeuchler are in the outfield. First baseman, Steve Rach, is batting at .407.<br />\nSlacum leads in the RBI departmentwith<br />\nnine, while Deuchler is in second place<br />\nwith eight.<br />\nAlthough the scores of Hopkins' victories would indicate a weak pitching<br />\nstaff, such was not the case. \"The tight<br />\nschedule, due to the weather we have experienced, has been pretty tough on our<br />\npitching staff so far, but we've been getting enough runs to win and that's what\u2022<br />\ncounts. With proper rest, we have an<br />\nexcellent hurling staff,\" Thorne says.<br />\nThe leading Blue Jay hurlers are Dave<br />\nHoffman, Brice Dowell, and Rich Thielke.<br />\nHoffman leads the hurlers with a 2-0<br />\nrecord and a 3.68 earned run average.<br /><br />\nFewer Errors<br />\nPerhaps one of the most important differences in the Blue Jay record this year<br />\nhas been the performance of the team on<br /><br />\nthe field. Hopkins had made far less<br />\nerrors in the field than in years past,and<br />\nof course their record bears that out.<br />\nLast week saw Hopkins win all three<br />\nof their ballgames. The Blue Jays beat<br />\nTowson State last Thursday, 7-3. The<br />\nTigers are rated co-favorites alongwith<br />\nWestern Maryland to win the MasonDixon title. Prior to their loss to Hopkins<br />\nthey had an 8-2 record, with both of their<br />\nlosses coming against a strong Duke<br />\nUniversity ballclub. In that game,the big<br />\nfive-run seventh was highlighted by Glenn<br />\nDeuchler's three - run home run to knot<br />\nthe score.<br />\nLoyola's Greyhounds were next to fall<br />\nagainst Hopkins. Loyola had beaten Hopkins the last four times they had met over<br />\na span of two years. Loyola earlier this<br />\nyear won a decisive ballgame over<br />\nGeorgetown, 14 - 2. In this game, played<br />\nFriday, Steve Rach, singling with basesloaded in the bottom of the ninth, won the<br />\nball game for Hopkins, 10-9.<br />\nThen on Saturday, the Blue Jays handed<br />\nUrsinus a 16 - 14 loss. Ursinus had the day<br /><br />\nbefore beaten Mason-Dixon co-favorite,<br />\nWestern Maryland, 11-2. Both ballclubs<br />\nhad pretty much exhausted their pitching<br />\nstaffs, but Hopkins' superior hitting was<br />\nthe key in the slugfest, Key defensive<br />\nplays by Mike Abrams,a three-run home<br />\nrun by Bob Slacum, and a four for five<br />\nday at the plate, along with four runs<br />\nscored by Dennis O'Neill, highlighted the<br />\nSaturday game.<br /><br />\nThorne Optimistic<br />\nAsked about the rest of the season<br />\nThorne had this to say: \"I think we have<br />\nAn excellent ballclub. If we continue to<br />\nwork on our fundamentals and cut down<br />\neven more on our errors, there's no<br />\ntelling how far we'll go.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays have another heavy schedule this week with four games on tap.

The leading scorer<br />\nwas Cavaliers freshman attackman Tom Duquette with seven<br />\ngoals.<br />\nFollowing a 7-7 deadlock at<br />\nhalftime, Virginia combined an<br />\nunyielding defense with devastating attack to outscore Hopkins,<br />\n8-1.
