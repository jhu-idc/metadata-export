In answering<br />\nthe question of whether or not<br />\nHerodotus took sides, Nagy poined out that Herodotus, in playing<br />\nthe role of the \"histor,\" did not<br />\n<br />\ntake sides with either Athens or<br />\nSparta, or even Hellas.<br />\nA considerable audience turned<br />\nout for the lecture, consisting of<br />\nfaculty from other divisions of the<br />\nUniversity, students from other<br />\ndivisions of the University, and<br />\nalso outsiders.

HUT sees<br />\nthe extreme ultraviolet light that<br />\nis further on the spectrum that<br />\nwhat is visible to Hubble. One of<br />\nits goals is to search for the possible existence of an intergalactic<br />\nmedium, the material between<br />\ngalaxies. \"There may be more<br />\nmatter spread out than what we<br />\nsee in the galaxies. What is normally thought of as empty space<br />\ncould add up to most of the matter in the universe,\" revealed<br />\nDavidsen.<br />\nDavidsen explained the process<br />\nin which HUT searches for the intergalactic medium, \"HUT can<br />\nlook at distant quasars and produce certain absorption of extreme ultraviolet light while looking at the quasar. It can see if<br />\n<br />\nthere is evidence of matter that is<br />\notherwise invisible.\" Extreme<br />\nultraviolet light has never before<br />\nbeen collected by a telescope.<br />\nSamuel Durrance will accompahy the HUT as a payload<br />\nspecialist on the January, 1989,<br />\nSpace Shuttle mission.

Davidsen and Knox<br />\nLong, a HUT project scientist,<br />\nwere also finalists for the shuttle<br />\ntrip. As principal investigator for<br />\nHUT, Davidsen will be in the<br />\ncontrol center in Huntsville,<br />\nAlabama, to \"watch over Sam's<br />\nshoulder\" during the trip.<br />\nBefore the explosion of the<br />\nChallenger, Hopkins had planned for the HUT to go up in<br />\nMarch, 1986, November 1986,<br />\nand August, 1987. According to<br />\nDavidsen, the explosion \"has<br />\nbeen a real disaster, it delayed us<br />\n2-3 years. We are pleased to see<br />\nthem back on schedule.\"<br />\n\"We are planning for the space<br />\ntelescopes to be the only thing we<br />\nwould be doing this year,\" said<br />\nDavidsen. During the 'interim,<br />\nwork continues on HUT. \"We<br />\n<br />\nhad to start repldnning for the<br />\nlong storage period at Cape<br />\nCanaveral,\" he explained. At the<br />\nmoment, the Center for Astrophysics relies on ground based<br />\ntelescopes in Arizona and Chile,<br />\nand has plans for a larger<br />\ntelescope.<br />\nPlans were announced on<br />\nNovember 3, 1986, for<br />\n\"Hopkins, joined with the<br />\nCarnegie Institute of Washington,<br />\nto design and develop a very large<br />\nground telescope in Chile, the<br />\nlargest in the Southern Hemisphere,\" explained Davidsen.<br />\n\"Hopkins will own 25 percent of<br />\nthe ground telescope,\" he said,<br />\n\"so we will not be totally dependent on NASA and will have continuous access.\" The telescope<br />\nshould be ready in the early<br />\n1990's, but there is no detailed<br />\nschedule yet.<br />\n\"Things are very exciting here<br />\nin astrophysics, especially with<br />\nthe new shuttles.\" Davidsen<br />\nremarked in closing, \"We're doing the best we can to make<br />\nHopkins the world center for<br />\nastrophysics.\"<br />\n<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\nArthur Davidsen, director for the Center for Astrophysical Sciences at<br />\nHopkins, who will be one of the first to use the new Hubble Space Telescope<br />\nbefore it is handed over for international use.<br />\n<br />\nRubik's Magic Foiled By Student's Math Wizardry<br />\nhy Ashu Handa<br />\nAshwin Belur, a Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity mathematics major<br />\nfrom the class of '85, became an<br />\novernight media sensation by<br />\npublishing the solution book to<br />\nDr. Erno Rubik's new puzzle,<br />\n\"Rubik's Magic.\"<br />\nBelur, along with fellow<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania<br />\ngraduate student Blair Whitaker,<br />\nreceived the puzzle from a<br />\nretailer three weeks ago, solved<br />\nit, and wrote a manuscript within<br />\na week. They then contacted Dell<br />\nPublishers in New York, who<br />\nagreed to print it.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Hungarian inventor, beaten at his own game by<br />\ntwo college students, is suing<br />\nBelur, Whitaker, and Dell<br />\nPublishing Company for violating<br />\nhis trademark, patent, and<br />\n<br />\ncopyrights. \"I don't like that,\"<br />\nsaid Rubik bitterly, after first<br />\nhearing about the new book.<br />\nRubik had intended to publish his<br />\nown solution book early next<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe legal confrontation that<br />\nBelur and his friend's ingenuity<br />\nhas provoked will only create<br />\nmore media attention. The two<br />\nauthors have already been interviewed by major news agencies<br />\nin the nation and have had stories<br />\npublished in the New York Times,<br />\nthe Sun, and Newsweek<br />\nmagazine. To top it all, they<br />\nappeared on Good Morning<br />\nAmerica last Monday, November<br />\n3, but Belur wants even more.<br />\n\"I want to get on David Letterman,\" said Belur with a<br />\ncheeky grin on his face.<br />\nLetterman or not, one thing is<br />\ncertain: these two will not be<br />\n<br />\nwriting home for money<br />\nanymore. Their book, with all the<br />\nattention given to it, is already<br />\nselling at a best-seller rate and is<br />\nscheduled to reach the shops in<br />\nthe first week of November. That<br />\nis, unless Rubik gets his way.<br />\nRubik will try and delay the<br />\nrelease of the book to the general<br />\npublic with legal action. \"It's my<br />\nidea, my work,\" said the inventor. \"It's completely unauthorized. I'm disappointed and surprised the authors or the publishers<br />\ndidn't contact me.\"<br />\nThe literary agents and<br />\npublishers of Belur declined to<br />\ncomment, but a spokesman for<br />\nthe puzzle's manufacturers, Matchbox Toys U.S.A. proclaimed,<br />\n\"They're using someone else's<br />\nwork as a launching pad. We<br />\nhave every intention of protecting<br />\nnot only our patent, but also the<br />\n<br />\nname that goes with it.\"<br />\nBelur first got the idea for the<br />\nbook when he heard about the<br />\npuzzle over the radio this summer. He remembered that after<br />\nthe \"Rubik's Cube\u2014 was released, there were three solution<br />\nbooks to the puzzle on the New<br />\nYork Times Best-Seller list<br />\nfollowing Christmas. \"I knew<br />\nsomebody was going to write a<br />\nbook and somebody was going to<br />\nhave a bestseller. I figured it<br />\nmight as well be me,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nThe students started a<br />\nscavenger hunt for a copy of the<br />\npuzzle in late August, and finally received a promotional copy on<br />\nSept. 22. They then started their<br />\nmarathon quest for the solution,<br />\nwhich eventually took them 50<br />\nhours. Belur found an agent<br />\nthrough a friend in a Penn<br />\n<br />\ncafeteria.

First, there probably<br />\nwill be staff writers who cannot<br />\nwrite good copy.

His usual attempts to<br />\ndisplay his intellect failed in the<br />\nfirst paragraph with the incorrect<br />\nuse of the word \"metamorphose.\" Neither the copy editors<br />\nnor the chief editor caught this;<br />\nperhaps they were overawed by<br />\nMr. Wu's ponderous style and<br />\nverbiage.<br />\nMr. Wu could use some.<br />\npointers on writing reviews as<br />\nwell. His article on Murray<br />\nPerahia's recital spent an inordinate amount of time describing<br />\ncertain members of the audience<br />\nand the color of their seats.<br />\nMr.Wu did not even identify the<br />\npiece that Mr. Perahia played as<br />\nan encore.<br />\nThese deficiencies pale in comparison to the unbelievable<br />\nblunder committed by the arts<br />\neditors in affixing the title \"Frank<br />\nSays It's a Good Performance of<br />\nthe HSO\" on to the review.

The word of administrators and Trustees on any<br />\nmatter before them must be<br />\nauthoritative, according to this<br />\nview; they are, after all, in positions of authority. Should any<br />\nconfusion persist, we are asked to<br />\nlook to who owns the place. The<br />\ncandidates most frequently put<br />\nforward are the Trustees (they<br />\ndon't have to work, you never see<br />\nthem, and they have all that<br />\npower\u2014they must be the<br />\nowners!).<br />\nAll complaints ultimately<br />\nreside in the(by the no means unpolitical) aesthetic dimension.<br />\nVisible protest is irritating; deviant actions and words disturb<br />\nthe mall-like beauty of the campus. This beauty. of course, is<br />\n<br />\nin surprise. It was the Hut<br />\nComptroller\u2014that butch of a TA<br />\nwho has absolute and ultimate<br />\ncontrol over Hut activities\u2014 the<br />\none who usually sits at the desk<br />\nand presides over the paperclips<br />\nand staplers.<br />\n\"No soda in the Hut,\" she<br />\nbarked, in a voice lower and<br />\nmore resonant than the demon<br />\nfrom The Exorcist.<br />\n\"Hey,\" I said, grabbing my<br />\nbottle back. \"That's mine.\" Her<br />\neyes narrowed to little slits. She<br />\npuffed up her massive chest and<br />\nsnarled, \"No soda in the Hut.\"<br />\nShe held out a hairy hand so I<br />\ncould surrender my Diet Coke.<br />\n\"Lighten up, Babe,\" I said.<br />\n\"It's 2:30 in the morning. Can't<br />\nyou just go away and leave me in<br />\npeace?\"<br />\n\"No soda in the Hut,\" she<br />\nsnarled again, her foot pawing the<br />\nground. She was beginning to<br />\nbreathe heavily and snort through<br />\nher nose. \"Give that to me,\" she<br />\n<br />\nordered.<br />\nThis was too much. I had a nasty Physics exam to study for, and<br />\nnow some bulldyke wanted to<br />\nconfiscate my Diet Coke.<br />\n\"No.\" I said, hopping up from<br />\nmy seat and running to the far end<br />\nof the table, bottle in hand.<br />\n\"Give that to me!\" she barked, then pounded the table with<br />\nher fists. Physics books and<br />\npapers scattered everywhere, as<br />\nthe powerful blows began to<br />\ncrack the wooden table.<br />\n\"Nya. Nya. You can't have<br />\nit,\" I sing-songed, and took a<br />\nswig from the bottle just to annoy<br />\nher. Face twitching in fury, she<br />\nlurched around the table, snarling<br />\nand heaving like an enraged bull.<br />\nI took off on a sprint across the<br />\nroom, hiding behind the central,<br />\nround desk.<br />\n\"Over here, Wart-hog!\" I yelled, waving the Diet Coke bottle.<br />\n<br />\nthat of a well-honed aesthetic of<br />\nhomogeneity developed through<br />\nyears of intense exposure to<br />\nwealthy suburbs, complete with<br />\nprime-time television and anemic<br />\nfamily life. The environment promoted and defended by Coalition<br />\ndetractors is, in the final analysis,<br />\nsuffocatingly anti-intellectual.<br />\n<br />\nsensus on University divestiture.<br />\nThe Student Council's condemnation was unfortunate in that it occurred before it had knowledge of<br />\nthe whole situation leading to the<br />\noccupation of the University administration building. Scott FitzGerald, the Sophomore Class<br />\nPresident, who proposed the<br />\nresolution, said, \"I acted in ignorance\" (I invite you to check<br />\nthis quotation with your reporter),<br />\nand that he would not have written the resolution had he known<br />\nbefore what he knew after his<br />\nmeeting with the Coalition. Regrettably, the News-Letter did<br />\nnothing to inform its readers of<br />\nthe nature of the Student Council<br />\ncondemnation, nor of its subsequent retraction by its author.<br />\nI would also like to inquire why<br />\nthe News-Letter chose not to print<br />\nits interview of Coalition<br />\nmembers conducted during the<br />\nfirst days of the occupation. The<br />\nmedia should strive to accurately<br />\nreport both sides of an event, not<br />\nsimply the reactions of the majority in order to facilitate an<br />\nunderstanding of opposing<br />\nmethods.<br />\n<br />\nStephen En<br />\n<br />\nSouth Africa 2<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nContinued on Page 14<br />\n<br />\nLast week's article on the Student Council's condemnation of<br />\nthe Coalition's occupation of<br />\nMandela Hall was disturbingly<br />\ninaccurate in that it failed to<br />\nreport the outcome of the ensuing meeting between the Student<br />\nCouncil and the Coalition. While<br />\nthe Student Council meeting<br />\nreporter was present, the Student<br />\nCouncil failed to give any specific<br />\ndisruption caused by the Coalition<br />\nas the direct result of the building<br />\noccupation.

Lynch in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter. Unfortunately, Mr. Lynch seems not to<br />\nrecognize a little self-parody mixed in with a serious political<br />\nmessage. The Coalition neither is<br />\nnor intends to be a 60's revival.<br />\nBut we find that label, often applied by our critics, a humorous<br />\none and are quite willing to play<br />\nwith it. The same goes for the<br />\nposter asking if people were sick<br />\nof the ugly shanties. We consider<br />\ntheir ugliness exactly the point<br />\nand find it amusing that so many<br />\nseem to believe politics should be<br />\nsubjugated to aesthetics. Had our<br />\ndemand for total divestment been<br />\nmet the shanties would be gone<br />\nalready. As it is the ugliness continues to pervade Hopkins and so<br />\nis manifested by the ugly shanties. But this is getting far too<br />\nserious for I really wish to remind<br />\nMr. Lynch of the immortal words<br />\nof Foghorn Leghorn, \"Joke, boy,<br />\n<br />\njoke. You're 'bout as sharp as a<br />\nbowling ball.\"<br />\nSidney Maskit<br />\n<br />\nSouth Africa 4<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe News-Letter's coverage of<br />\nthe Trustee's vote on divestment<br />\nand the Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica's response failed to ask<br />\nwhy the Coalition's protest took<br />\nthe form it did. Everyone knew<br />\nthat the Coalition would have to<br />\ntake action on a no-divestment<br />\nvote. Why these particular actions? (For those commuting<br />\nfrom another planet, members of<br />\nthe Coalition picketed the<br />\nTrustees' meeting, impeded the<br />\nexit of those Trustees who tried<br />\nto leave early, yelled at them, catcalled during the subsequent press<br />\nconference, and then occupied the<br />\nadministration building.)<br />\nAs a member of the Coalition,<br />\nbut not writing at the behest of the<br />\nCoalition, I strongly believe the<br />\nHopkins community deserves an<br />\nexplanation of those actions the<br />\nNews-Letter labeled shameful.<br />\nThe Trustees encountered such<br />\na rude response because they<br />\ndealt with the student body in bad<br />\nfaith. No Trustee sitting on the<br />\nboard of a company doing<br />\nbusiness in South Africa disqualified himself from voting on<br />\n<br />\ndivestment. At the meeting they<br />\ncontinued to act without shame.<br />\nSeveral Trustees attempted to<br />\nleave the meeting early without<br />\nbeing noticed. They took a back<br />\nway. They did so without asking<br />\nthe Coalition to move so they<br />\ncould leave through the normal<br />\nexit. (Head of Security Robert<br />\nLarkin did in fact ask former<br />\nCoalition co-chairman Paul<br />\nGenest if we intended to block the<br />\nTrustees' way after their meeting<br />\nhad ended. Paul told him no.) As<br />\nthose Trustees left they refused to<br />\ntell us the results of their deliberation. Though the News-Letter<br />\ndoes not make this clear, the<br />\noverwhelming cries of Coalition<br />\nmembers as those Trustees left<br />\nwere, \"What's the vote?\" and<br />\n\"You're sneaking out the back<br />\nway,\" as this appeared to be what<br />\nthey were doing. Is it any wonder<br />\nthat we then moved to block their<br />\nexit? Our actions have always<br />\nbeen open and honest; their actions have never been so. Both the<br />\ncurses hurled at the Trustees as<br />\nthey announced their investment<br />\nchoice and subsequent occupation<br />\nof Mandela Hall reflected the<br />\nCoalition's immense frustration at<br />\nthe Trustees' disingenuous dealings, both in content and style. It<br />\nmust be remembered that the<br />\nCoalition's actions were very<br />\nmuch a response to a situation<br />\ndevised by the Trustees.<br />\nDan Schechter, Class of '87<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\nBRITISH<br />\nARE<br />\nCOMIN<br />\n<br />\nSunny's crossed the ocean to bring you this<br />\nGENUINE SURPLUS BRITISH<br />\nCOMMANDO SWEATER, made of<br />\n100% virgin wool in a heavy ribknit for extra warmth.

If the Council<br />\nmembers had indeed approached<br />\nthe Coalition before taking their<br />\nvote, perhaps they could have at<br />\nthe very least understood why the<br />\nCoalition was present in Garland.<br />\n(To Sa Surmelli's statement that<br />\nthe Coalition should have come to<br />\nthe Council, we respond that we<br />\nwould have, had we known that<br />\nthe issue was to be on the table.)<br />\nInstead, the Coalition's actions<br />\nwere written off as being merely<br />\n\"disruptive.\" And without pausing to consider whom the Coalition represented, the Council<br />\nassumed that the Coalition was<br />\ndeliberately misleading the<br />\nmedia.<br />\nIf our two groups had met<br />\n(before the vote), perhaps we<br />\ncould have explained why we felt<br />\nthat many Trustees were unequivocally acting in conflict of interest, and how we felt that the<br />\nTrustees had acted in bad faith by<br />\npromising a yes/no vote on full<br />\ndivestment and then voting only<br />\non a compromised package. And<br />\nperhaps we could have stated that<br />\nthe entire sum of these and other<br />\ncircumstances has forced us to<br />\nescalate our level of activity until our concerns can be adequately addressed.<br />\nAnd maybe, if there had been<br />\ncontact prior to the resolution, the<br />\nmembers of the Student Council<br />\ncould have noted that we occupied the Administration<br />\nbuilding specifically so as not to<br />\ninterfere with the academic<br />\ngoings-on of a student's life and<br />\nas such were confronting only the<br />\npeople to whom our petitions are<br />\naddressed.<br />\nIn closing, however, I would<br />\nlike to commend the efforts of<br />\nCouncil member Winston<br />\nVaughan for attempting to promote dialogue before the vote,<br />\nand to thank Oneeka Williams for<br />\nasserting that \"the Coalition\" is<br />\nnot \"deliberately trying to bias<br />\nthe press.\"<br />\nM.Bijoy Mathew<br />\n<br />\nSouth Africa 6<br />\n<br />\n50<br />\n<br />\nOFF<br />\nTHE BRITISH<br />\nI<br />\nI COMMANDO SWEATER<br />\n\u2022 w/ this coupon<br />\nLimit 2 per person<br />\n.<br />\n1<br />\nI Exp. 1/31/87<br />\n111111.1111111111110 \u2014<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\nSIVN8<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\ne.<br />\n<br />\nVIWIIIS<br />\n\u00b0Lint<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\nGtee<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn all the recent controversy<br />\nsurrounding the JHU Coalition<br />\nfor a Free South Africa, it is important to remember that there<br />\nare two very distinct issues<br />\ninvolved\u2014the actions of the<br />\nCoalition and divestment itself.<br />\nMany students have voiced the<br />\nopinion that, while they favor<br />\ndivestment, they are opposed to<br />\nthe means the Coalition has used<br />\nto pressure the Trustees to divest.<br />\nThe problem with this quite<br />\nreasonable position is that it<br />\nmoves the focus of attention.froth<br />\ndiVestment, which should be the<br />\n<br />\nprimary issue at hand, to the<br />\nCoalition. Because these people<br />\nfeel offended or alienated by the<br />\nCoalition, they seem to be forgeting that they and the Coalition<br />\nshare the same goal\u2014alleviating<br />\nthe suffering of the victims of<br />\napartheid.<br />\nThe Coalition's methods of<br />\npressuring the Trustees to vote<br />\nfor divestment may very well offend some members of the JHU<br />\ncommunity. But if these members<br />\ndo favor divestment, why don't<br />\nthey suggest to the Coalition<br />\nother, more acceptable, means of<br />\nachieving this important end? The<br />\nCoalition has been, and is, willing to listen and respond to opinions from outside of its ranks.<br />\nAnyone can come to a Coalition<br />\nmeeting, and those with serious<br />\nsuggestions should not fear<br />\nridicule or lack of attention.<br />\nThe Coalition, though, seems<br />\nto be the only group on campus<br />\nwith any strategy for achieving<br />\ndivestment. It appears that those<br />\nfavoring divestment and opposing<br />\nthe Coalition are content to sit<br />\naround and talk about the evils of<br />\napartheid instead of actually doing anything. If for nothing else,<br />\nthe Coalition should be appreciated for making an effort to<br />\nchange the status quo in favor of<br />\nthe oppressed. It may, in the opinions of some, have made some<br />\ntactical errors, but at least it is doing something.<br />\nI urge the students who share<br />\nthe Coalition's concern for the<br />\nvictims of apartheid to put aside<br />\ntheir reservations and talk to<br />\nsome Coalition members about<br />\ndivestment.

Twice, when a 'prodivestment, anti-Coalition' group<br />\ncalled a meeting in Levering, our<br />\npeople went to see what was up<br />\nbut the meetings never materialized. I'll be fascinated to see what<br />\ntactics such a group might one<br />\nday pull together to gain divestment; the Coalition tried every<br />\nsingle trick in the book, unsuccessfully, before resorting to the<br />\nbuilding occupation.<br />\nThe third attempt\u2014by 'Students Against the Desecration of<br />\n<br />\nau<br />\narxramtu-ta r no<br />\n<br />\nwent against us. Our major complaint is that the conflict of interest issue was inadequately addressed, thereby allowing at least<br />\ntwenty Trustees, who themselves<br />\nwork for companies which do<br />\nbusiness in South Africa, to vote<br />\nin conflict of interest. It should be<br />\nrecalled that the Trustees' own<br />\nby-laws state \"that all Board<br />\nmembers avoid any conflict, or<br />\nappearance of conflict, between<br />\ntheir personal interests and the interests of the University.<br />\nFurthermore, the pro-divestment<br />\narguments were never addressed<br />\nby the Trustees, and no substantive justification for the selective<br />\ndivestment policy was put forth.<br />\nWhat's more, our position has<br />\nbeen, and is commonly caricatured by the Trustees, that the<br />\nUniversity totally divest immediately. We have explicitly<br />\ncalled for, and continue to call<br />\nfor, an immediate committment<br />\nto full divestment, to be carried<br />\nout in phases over two years.<br />\nWe asked that two concerns be<br />\naddressed during our stay in<br />\nGarland Hall. Our requests for<br />\nthe minutes of the Trustees'<br />\nmeeting, and a University-wide<br />\nbinding referendum on total<br />\ndivestment, were refused. The<br />\nidea behind these demands has<br />\nbeen to open Hopkins' decisionmaking process to campus<br />\nscrutiny and participation. We<br />\nwere hoping that students would<br />\ninquire as to our concerns, and<br />\nthat we could create a space for<br />\ncritical debate over the issue of<br />\ndivestment as well as University<br />\ngovernance. Instead, on campus<br />\nwe have been viewed with hostility, which we feel is a result of<br />\ngeneral lack of understanding<br />\nabout our goals and tactics, and<br />\nperhaps even the unwillingness of<br />\nmany to openly confront their immediate surroundings.<br />\nWhile the vigil in the Administration building has been<br />\ndifficult for the Coalition, its supporters, other students and<br />\nHopkins officials, we feel it has<br />\nbeen a necessary and appropriate<br />\nstep on the road to divestment and<br />\na better understanding of both<br />\nprocess and policy at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\n<br />\no<br />\n<br />\nSALADS<br />\n<br />\nSUBS<br />\n<br />\nSouth Africa 8<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n* NOW'SERVING *<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n__:.:1120.11\u20221\u202220-a.thiliA<br />\n<br />\nContinued from Page 12<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nnolo anon<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n?<br />\n4,<br />\nzfr<br />\n*<br />\n-J<br />\n*<br />\n,.<br />\nLi).6<br />\n=<br />\n,<br />\nr\u2022:.:<br />\n\u2022cly<br />\nE.:.<br />\n--,<br />\nR<br />\n4_.<br />\n------=---- . --- -444.<br />\n-- -. ..-.....\u2022-1.4.\u2022<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nS.<br />\n<br />\nt=s<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nNEXT SCHOOL?<br />\nThink about the time and energy spent<br />\neducating yourself.

What are they to think of<br />\na community of some of the most<br />\ngifted people in the world who<br />\nquietly handed over their voice to<br />\nthis Board of Trustees?<br />\nIn quietly occupying Mandela<br />\nHall and demanding a binding<br />\nreferendum on total divestment,<br />\nthe Coalition has made clear its<br />\nintent to find a way that will allow<br />\nthe community here as a whole to<br />\ndecide this issue. For the ultimate<br />\nsurvival of this University within<br />\nthe ever-expanding corporate<br />\nstructure that is now JHU, this<br />\nquestion could not be of more<br />\nimportance.<br />\nPhilip Murphy<br />\n<br />\nbrutally frank<br />\nContinued from Page 10<br />\nconflict.<br />\nMeanwhile, a high-ranking<br />\nmember of a film series reports<br />\nthat the Coalition is postering<br />\nduring movies and placing their<br />\nposters next to or below film<br />\nseries ads. He explains, \"This<br />\nsuggests a visual equation. People will think we put them up.<br />\nAnd we can't take a stand on the<br />\nissue. We're not a political<br />\ngroup.\" Confronting the Coalition and suggesting they poster at<br />\nsome other time and some other<br />\nplace not quite so near the films<br />\nseries, he was offended by the<br />\nresponse, a lecture on the purpose<br />\n<br />\nof a university and free speech.<br />\nHe mentions that but for the film<br />\nseries, the building would not be<br />\nopen and there would be no opportunity to poster; he only requests that Coalition posters be<br />\nfurther away from films series<br />\nposters.<br />\nHe concludes,\"a lot of people<br />\nare pro-divestment and antiCoalition.

Many might not realize<br />\nthat such beliefs can be traced to<br />\nancient times\u2014furthermore, it<br />\nmight seem that a culture as<br />\nsophisticated and steeped in logic<br />\nand order as the ancient Greeks<br />\nwould have had no time for<br />\ncurses and spells.<br />\nOn the contrary. Luck said,<br />\n\"Once the basic premise is accepted, there is a great deal of<br />\nconsistency within the system. . .<br />\nbrought so by the Greeks. In that<br />\nsense, magic is a sort of<br />\n<br />\ndition, they took over some native<br />\ndeities and rejected those which<br />\nseemed \"truly outlandish.\"<br />\nHowever, these rejected gods<br />\ncontinued to live on as a form of<br />\nwitchcraft.<br />\nThe most important records<br />\nfrom history are the magical<br />\npapyri\u2014enormous scrolls, the<br />\nfirst of which was found in an<br />\nEgyptian magician's tomb in<br />\n1830. The papyri, according to<br />\nLuck, \"show us the sort of power<br />\nthat men wished to have on<br />\nothers.\" They are filled with<br />\nrecipes and formulas for<br />\neverything from curses to love.<br />\n\"At the time it must have created<br />\nno less of a sensation than the<br />\ndiscovery of the Dead Sea<br />\nScrolls . \" writes Luck. And<br />\nwhile there are literally thousands<br />\nof lines of text, it is assumed that<br />\n<br />\nWe can no longer idealize the Greeks<br />\nand their 'artistic logic'or the Romans<br />\nand their 'sober realism'. ..<br />\nYr<br />\n<br />\nscience.\"<br />\nLuck's recently published<br />\nbook, Arcana Mundi\u2014Magic and<br />\nOccult in the Greek and Roman<br />\nWorlds, tells how the occult is<br />\ntraced from ancient cultures.<br />\nLuck believes that magic and<br />\nreligion are closely interrelated.<br />\nHe writes, \"magic may be called<br />\na religion that has been distorted<br />\nand misinterpreted beyond<br />\nrecognition by a hostile environment almost from the beginnings<br />\nof history.\"<br />\nThe ancient Greeks, for example, conquered other nations and<br />\ntook on some of their customs and<br />\nrituals without really making any<br />\neffort to understand them. In ad-<br />\n<br />\nthe papyri found are only a small<br />\npart of the magical literature actually written.<br />\nIn addition to magic, Arcana<br />\nMundi also deals with the subject<br />\nof miracles and explains how they<br />\ndiffer from magic. On the whole,<br />\nwhile magic may be performed<br />\nclandestinely, miracles must be<br />\nwitnessed by others. But more<br />\nimportantly it is \"a matter of<br />\nfaith. . .one person's religion<br />\nmay be another person's magic,\"<br />\nwrites Luck.<br />\nLuck devotes a chapter of his<br />\nbook to daemonology, in which<br />\nhe traces the origins of the belief<br />\nin daemons or evil spirits. He<br />\nwrites that ancient cultures<br />\n<br />\nbelieved in the presence of all<br />\nkinds of spirits, but they could<br />\nonly make contact with the \"unquiet dead\u2014those who had died<br />\nbefore their time, met with a<br />\nviolent death. . .or been deprived of a proper burial.\" These<br />\nspirits were believed to have<br />\nangrily roamed the earth because<br />\nthey were dissatisfied with their<br />\nown fate.<br />\nLuck explained how the ancient<br />\nCeltic ritual of Halloween arose<br />\nfrom these beliefs. Apparently the<br />\nCelts attempted to pacify these<br />\nroaming ghosts on Halloween<br />\nnight by placing food on their<br />\ndoorsteps\u2014hence trick-ortreating. Festivals such as this<br />\nwere taken over by the church<br />\nbecause it was difficult to uproot<br />\nsuch ancient traditions. Halloween became All Souls' Day for<br />\nthe Christian world.<br />\nThe ancients also had a great<br />\nconcern for those spirits that were<br />\nnot threatening\u2014such as the<br />\nghosts of their own family. Luck<br />\nsaid, \"people used to go out to<br />\nAngelo Tanna<br />\nthe cemeteries and picnic on the Dr. Georg Luck, Hopkins Classics professor and editor of Arcana Mundi.<br />\nfamily graves.

The<br />\n1940's farce by Joseph Kesselring remains a stodgy classic in<br />\nold-fashioned American comedy.<br />\nIn the Barnstormers' production,<br />\nthe play moves a little stiffly<br />\naround the joints, but old as it is,<br />\nit gets the laughs out.<br />\nThe first thing to notice is Andy Angelino's wonderful set. Not<br />\nonly is there a wall lined with<br />\nbookcases, paintings, and three<br />\nworking doors, but there is actually a second floor--complete<br />\nwith a carpeted staircase. The<br />\nListening/Viewing<br />\nRoom<br />\n(designed for neither listening nor<br />\nviewing) is a terrible theater, but<br />\nthe Arsenic set transcends even<br />\nthat.<br />\nThe play begins in the Brewster<br />\nhome in Brooklyn. Abby<br />\nBrewster (Kelli Midgley) and her<br />\nsister Martha (Alice Griffin) live<br />\nin the house taking care of their<br />\nnephew Teddy (Scott McNamee).<br />\nAbby and Martha make chicken<br />\nbroth for sick neighbors and help<br />\n<br />\nwhenever they can, and Teddy<br />\nthinks that he is Theodore<br />\nRoosevelt. Policemen come over<br />\nto collect old toys for the<br />\nChristmas fund, and there is a<br />\ndead body in the window seat. It's<br />\nas nice and cozy as Our Town<br />\nturned inside out.<br />\nThe two aunts are lively, sweet<br />\nand overly bubbly, as if they had<br />\nstepped out from an imitation<br />\nNorman Rockwell. But Abby and<br />\nMartha also mix elderberry wine<br />\nwith arsenic and cyanide, and<br />\nfeed it to lonely old men looking<br />\nto rent a room. They've been doing this some while and there are<br />\nnow eleven bodies in the cellar,<br />\nin graves dug by Teddy, who<br />\nthinks he is digging locks for the<br />\nPanama Canal. Another nephew,<br />\nMortimer (Vince Li Cata) is a<br />\ntheater critic and sane (if one can<br />\nbe both). He is in love with the<br />\nPreacher's daughter, Elaine<br />\n(Carol Gerry). Mortimer finds<br />\nout about the elderberry wine and<br />\ndecides it is time to stop it. As he<br />\nputs it: \"This is becoming a very<br />\nbad habit.\"<br />\nArsenic and Old Lace is a play<br />\nof double-takes; the ordinary is<br />\nshifted just slightly out of focus.<br />\nThe great joy is the spoof of<br />\nmysteries\u2014the audience can<br />\nrelish in knowing something the<br />\nactors don't. Mortimer is a real<br />\nsharp-tongued journalist in the<br />\ntradition of The Front Page. Li<br />\nCata plays him as a nervous,<br />\nquirky intellectual. He makes<br />\n<br />\nwonderful cracks about criticism,<br />\nsuch as, \"I can save time if I<br />\nwrite my review on the way to the<br />\ntheater.\" Or he says to a colleague, \"I was just feeling a<br />\nbit. . .Pirandellish.\"<br />\nIn Act Two, the other nephew<br />\ncomes home. Jonathan Brewster<br />\n(Chris Barrett) returns after<br />\ntraveling the world murdering<br />\npeople. He returns with a jumpy<br />\nsurgeon known as Dr. Einstein<br />\n(Jeremy Golub). In the film,<br />\nEinstein was played by Peter<br />\nLorre, but Golub makes the part<br />\nhis own. Jonathan, who was<br />\nmade to look like Boris Karloff<br />\nafter some of Einstein's plastic<br />\nsurgery, wants to move back<br />\nhome and set up a plastic surgery<br />\nshop. \"Practically everybody in<br />\nBrooklyn needs a new face,\" he<br />\nexplains. These two have brought<br />\ntheir own corpse, and the comedy<br />\nensues.<br />\nThe aunts work in their own<br />\nperfectly logical fashion,<br />\nendeavoring to help friendless old<br />\ngentlemen find \"peace.\" When<br />\nMortimer says, \"There are 12<br />\nmen in the cellar and you admit<br />\nyou've poisoned them,\" Abby<br />\nreplies: \"Yes, I did. But I<br />\nwouldn't stoop to lying.\"<br />\nMidgley's great asset is her<br />\nvoice, fluttering like the old lace<br />\ndecorating her home. She is just<br />\na slightly better comedienne than<br />\nGriffin, who nevertheless is an<br />\nexcellent, if slightly posed, actress. When the twelfth body is<br />\n<br />\nhidden in the window seat, they<br />\ntell Teddy to keep it a secret. He<br />\nthinks a moment, then<br />\nMcNamee's eyes light up, \"A<br />\nstate secret?\" McNamee is a<br />\nvery funny Teddy, not overplaying the role, yet keeping him off<br />\nthe wall enough so that the audience looks forward to his next<br />\nentrance.<br />\nMortimer tries to explain to<br />\nElaine that he can't marry her<br />\nbecause of his heritage. \"Insanity runs in my family. In fact, it<br />\npractically gallops.\" There is<br />\ngood chemistry between them,<br />\nthough Li Cata (with his Jimmy<br />\nStewart awkwardness) is at first<br />\noverpowered by Gerry. Gerry<br />\ncomes on strong with her be-bop<br />\nhairstyle and expressive mouth.<br />\nLi Cata, with wild facial expressions, voice cracking and<br />\nbrowline jumping, is a frantically witty Mortimer, yet he lacks<br />\nthe presence to make a realistic<br />\nfoil for Jonathan.<br />\nAs Jonathan, Chris Barrett<br />\nfumes, sneers and boils. Unfortunately the play doesn't allow for<br />\nhis character to explode, and he<br />\nis kept within a limited range. Except for some trouble with his<br />\nlines, Barrett comes off well. Accolades are due for Jeremy<br />\nGolub, a physical actor par excellence. With eyebrows twitching and eyes rolling, Golub<br />\nsteals almost every scene he is in.<br />\nAll eyes are on Golub's mimicking of Elaine as Jonathan<br />\n<br />\nthreatens her, and the funniest<br />\nscene of the night is when Einstein tries to get out of the window<br />\nseat.<br />\nThe supporting cast is competent although the play gives them<br />\nlittle in the way of character.<br />\nGlenn White is sufficiently suffocating as a playwriting cop, and<br />\nJason Hanson is bothersome as a<br />\npompous policemen with an innocuous smirk plastered to his<br />\nface. The script itself drags a little in parts. Arsenic really is too<br />\nlong a play, but one sits through<br />\nit to see some fine examples of<br />\nhumor, as when Jonathan<br />\ndiscovers that the aunts have killed twelve men, just as he has.<br />\n\"Johnny,\" Einstein says,<br />\n\"We've been chased all over the<br />\nworld. And they [Abby and Martha] stayed in Brooklyn and did<br />\njust as good as you.\"<br />\nDirector David Deboy (who<br />\ndid last fall's Hot L Baltimore: the<br />\nBarnstormers' choice of plays<br />\nneeds work) paces it a bit too<br />\nslowly. There need to be more<br />\ncoincidences, as when Elaine hits<br />\nJonathan in the face with the<br />\ndoor. Besides some faltering<br />\nlights and some fragile props, the<br />\nproduction runs smoothly. Punch<br />\nand cookies during the intermission is a nice touch\u2014the Barnstormers have turned in a class<br />\nact. So, could theater at Hopkins<br />\nfinally becoming into its own?<br />\nMaybe, but first, have a glass of<br />\nelderberry wine.<br />\n<br />\nHare's Map of the World<br />\nby Laurah Limbrick<br />\n\"A Map of the World.\" Alexander Zale, Thomas Gibson, Lorraine Toussaint, Linda Cook;<br />\nDirected by Stan Wojewodski, Jr.<br />\n\"A Map of the World\" is a<br />\nvery tricky play. Set at a<br />\nUNESCO conference in 1978<br />\nBombay and the present, it poses<br />\nsome very difficult questions.<br />\nPlaywright David Hare, the man<br />\nwho brought us \"Plenty\" and<br />\n<br />\n\"Wetherby,\" analyzes several<br />\nThird World problems.<br />\nAt first, we are led to believe<br />\nthat we are actually at the conference, but it soon becomes apparent that we are actually on the<br />\nset of a movie being made years<br />\nlater.

Crocenzi<br />\nThose who say cancer research<br />\nhas stalled, that it has not produced any concrete results in recent<br />\nyears need only to visit the Oncology and Pharmacology Center<br />\nnestled in the sprawling Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical Institutions.<br />\nThe center, along with the entire<br />\nMedical Institutions continues to<br />\nbe a leader in the determined effort to grasp the mysteries of<br />\ncancer and to develop methods to<br />\neradicate the disease.<br />\nThe personnel at the Oncology<br />\nand Pharmacology Center range<br />\nfrom M.D. to Ph.D. to graduate<br />\nstudents. This talented group<br />\ncovers the full range of cancer<br />\nresearch from pure, basic<br />\nresearch to clinical research.<br />\nEach of many laboratories carries<br />\nout its assigned tasks, many times<br />\nlasting for years, in search of<br />\ntheir own particular goal. Yet,<br />\nthere seems to be a common bond<br />\nbetween each lab, and, in fact, the<br />\nlabs do depend on one another. In<br />\nbasic research, Dr. Bert Vogelstein heads a study of DNA in<br />\ntumor cells, and Dr. Joel Shaper<br />\nleads a study of the cell mem-<br />\n<br />\n00000000000000000<br />\n<br />\nProgress with CF<br />\nScientists at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nChildren's Center are perfecting<br />\na new technique to study digestive<br />\nproblems in children with cystic<br />\nfibrosis (CF). This new procedure is convenient and<br />\neconomical, involving only<br />\nnoninvasive breath and urine<br />\ntests. Physicians hope to use the<br />\ntechnique to identify CF patients<br />\nwho need enzyme supplements to<br />\naid in their digestion.<br />\nCF is a relatively common<br />\nhereditary disease, killing more<br />\nchildren and young adults in this<br />\ncountry than any other inherited<br />\ndisease. The disease inflicts permanent lung damage, and plugs<br />\npancreatic ducts which normally<br />\ncarry digestive enzymes into the<br />\nsmall intestine.<br />\nAPL Goes Biomedical<br />\nThe<br />\nApplied<br />\nPhysics<br />\nLaboratory of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity is producing several<br />\nnew medical machines in its twoyear-old bioelectromagnetics<br />\nlaboratory. Such machines include a brain edema sensor,<br />\nwhich could detect brain swelling<br />\nwithout the use of CAT scans, an<br />\nelectromagnetic bone healing<br />\nmonitor, and a superconducting<br />\nmagnetometer which could locate<br />\nseizure origins without the need<br />\nfor invasive surgery.<br />\n<br />\nbrane. Dr. Michael Colvin, a<br />\nclinical researcher, makes rounds<br />\nas an attending physician in the<br />\nhospital in the mornings and<br />\nevenings and then contributes the<br />\nremainder of the day leading a<br />\ncontinuing analysis of new cancer<br />\ndrugs. Although some anti-tumor<br />\ndrugs originate at Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, most arrive from the<br />\nprestigious National Cancer Institute. Dr. Colvin's lab tests<br />\nfrom four to five drugs each year.<br />\nCancer research facilities like<br />\nthose at JHMI are often criticized for wasting funds with little or<br />\nno results. In fact, great strides<br />\nhave been made in the last fifteen<br />\nyears. Many lymphomas like<br />\nbone marrow cancer now have a<br />\n50% cure rate, up from almost 0%<br />\nMany types of leukemia in<br />\nchildren, once deadly, now have<br />\na 50-80% cure rate. Patients who<br />\nonce had no hope of survival<br />\nfrom testicular cancer can now be<br />\ncured with almost 80% success.<br />\nThese are only a few of the fantastic accomplishments of physicians and scientists around the<br />\nworld. At Johns Hopkins, where<br />\nthe stress of the research is on<br />\nleukemia and lymphomas, a<br />\nbreakthrough for treating cancer<br />\nof the bone marrow has gained<br />\n<br />\nrecognition.<br />\nworld-wide<br />\nDeveloped by Dr. George Santos,<br />\nthis method replaces the previous<br />\nmethod which involved a marrow<br />\ntransplant from a sibling, only<br />\n30-50% successful. The new<br />\nmethod purges the patient's own<br />\nbone marrow removing the<br />\ntumorous cells and then replacing<br />\nthe purged marrow back in the<br />\npatient. This technique has shown<br />\nvery encouraging results, and the<br />\ningenious purging technique of<br />\nthe bone marrow has been applauded by cancer researchers<br />\neverywhere.<br />\nThere is no doubt that the true<br />\nexcitement of cancer research is<br />\nin the prospects for the future.<br />\nWith each day, the prospects approach realization. Researchers at<br />\nthe Oncology and Pharmacology<br />\nCenter have become leaders in<br />\nthe field, and some fascinating<br />\nprospects are being studied and<br />\ntested at this time. One such prospect is the promising compound<br />\nbeing developed by Dr. Steve<br />\nBaylin. The compound is based<br />\non the principle of making the<br />\ntumor cell develop properly or<br />\ndifferentiate as a healthy cell<br />\nwould, instead of the uncontrolled division present in tumor cells.<br />\nThis differentiating compound, in<br />\n<br />\neffect, a \"gene control\" would<br />\nslow or even stop the cancer process of uncontrolled cell division.<br />\nAnother prospect for the future<br />\nis the promising anti-tumor drug,<br />\ntumor necrosis factor, which has<br />\nshown amazing success in animal<br />\ntissue. Leading these tests are Dr.<br />\nRoss Donehower and Dr. David<br />\nS. Ettinger. Analysis of this promising drug continues as human<br />\ntests have just been approved.<br />\nStill another prospect is tackling<br />\nthe problem of tumor cells that<br />\nbecome resistant to chemical<br />\ntherapy. According to Dr. Colvin, the resistance may be due to<br />\nthe activation of dormant enzymes by the tumor cell. Researchers are now developing<br />\nbiochemical techniques to detect<br />\nand understand chemical resistant<br />\ntumor cells.<br />\nAnother technique being<br />\nstudied by Dr. Stanley Order involves tagging antibodies, the<br />\nnatural<br />\ndefense<br />\nbody's<br />\nmechanism, with radioactive<br />\nchemicals in order to eliminate<br />\ntumor cells more effectively.<br />\nNo one can deny that advances<br />\nin the field of cancer research are<br />\nbeing made. The fact that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Oncology and<br />\nPharmacology Center along with<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Science In Brief<br />\nM.D. has developed a computer<br />\nsystem that records medical procedures and analysis at The Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical Institutions.<br />\nThis experimental system,<br />\nthrough a vocabulary of 550<br />\nwords can create diagrams of<br />\nvarious parts of the body, and<br />\nafter more detailed information<br />\nhas been entered, a report can be<br />\ndeveloped.

Brody and J. Thompson<br />\nWhen Bill Tierney picked up<br />\nthe phone last Sunday night, he<br />\nheard the words he had been<br />\nwaiting to hear since he began<br />\ncoaching varsity soccer three<br />\nyears ago, words a Hopkins soccer team had not heard since<br />\n1975, words that seemed highly<br />\nimprobable at the beginning of<br />\nthe season when the \"Hooters\"<br />\nhad a record of 0-1-1 and had key<br />\ninjuries to their backfield\u2014The<br />\nJohns Hopkins men's varsity soccer team had made the NCAA<br />\nplayoffs.<br />\nThe team will be travelling<br />\ndown to Greensboro, North<br />\nCarolina to play their first division HI playoff game at 1 pm. this<br />\nSunday (directions available at<br />\nthe Athletic Center). The playoffs<br />\nare composed of six regions with<br />\nfour teams competing in each<br />\nregion in a single elimination<br />\ntournament. The \"Hooters\" are<br />\nranked fourth in their region and<br />\nare playing North Carolina,<br />\nGreensboro, the number one<br />\nranked team in the region. The<br />\nGreensboro Spartans are certainly<br />\nformidable competition. They<br />\nwon the National Division III title last year and are attempting to<br />\npick up the honors for the fourth<br />\ntime in the last five years.<br />\nBased on their recent performance, though, this Hopkins<br />\nteam is in excellent shape after<br />\nwinning two big games at the end<br />\nof the regular season to top off a<br />\n14 game winning streak. The first<br />\nof these came last Friday night<br />\nagainst Washington College.<br />\nThings looked tight with Hopkins<br />\nneeding to win and win big over<br />\nWashington to receive a bid to the<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nJohn Horner<br />\n<br />\nAfter a decade of mediocrity, the Hooters have risen from nowhere to take the MAC Southern title and now are headed for the Division III playoffs.<br />\nNCAA division III championship<br />\ntournament. But, as Ray Giuriceo<br />\ndescribes it, \"this was the most<br />\nfired up I've ever seen the team.\"<br />\nIt showed. Hopkins outshot their<br />\nopponents 31-1 and won 4-0.<br />\nTeamwork was key in this victory<br />\nwith 8 players having a hand<br />\neither by scoring or having the<br />\nassist, in the four goals scored.<br />\n<br />\nThe second big win was this<br />\nTuesday against Gettysburg.<br />\nWith the MAC Southern Division<br />\nChampionship on the line, the<br />\nHooters came through with the<br />\nvictory. Even though their<br />\nleading scorer Craig Weinstein<br />\ndidn't get a goal (he did get an<br />\nassist) the rest of the team<br />\ncapitalized on the opposition's at-<br />\n<br />\ntention to Weinstein and netted 4 a 2-0 lead with only 12 seconds<br />\nbig goals on their way to a 4-0 on the clock.<br />\nwin. Perhaps the biggest goal<br />\nThese two wins capped off a<br />\ncame near the end of the first fine 14-1-I regular season record,<br />\nhalf. With the ball apparently 8-0 at home.

And with a 14-1-1<br />\nrecord and confidence that's skyhigh, they could go even further.<br />\nEven if the Hooters do falter on<br />\nSunday, though, it will hardly put<br />\na damper on what has been a<br />\nseason to remember. After all,<br />\nHopkins has been anything but a<br />\nsoccer powerhouse in recent<br />\nyears. In 1975, when the word<br />\n\"Hooter\" was probably in no<br />\nplayer's vocabulary, Hopkins<br />\nsent a soccer team to the NCAA's<br />\nFinal Four with a 13-1-1 record.<br />\nThe squad lost a 1-0 heartbreaker<br />\nin overtime to Brockport St., and<br />\nthen fell to Ohio Wesleyan in a<br />\nconsolation match. That was<br />\nabout it for the sport here, as the<br />\nJays didn't have another winning<br />\nseason until 1985. In the meantime, the school has won six<br />\nlacrosse titles, a swimming championship, and, of course, countless fencing crowns.<br />\nThe improbable turnaround actually began two summers ago<br />\nwhen Athletic Director Bob Scott<br />\nimported Bill Tierney in from the<br />\nRochester Institute of Technology<br />\nto be primarily an assistant<br />\n$ #<br />\nj<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nlacrosse coach, and as an afterthought, the head man for soccer.<br />\nTierney had already proven his<br />\nexpertise in the former, having<br />\nled an unheralded R.I.T. lax team<br />\ninto the NCAA's and receiving<br />\nthe Division III Coach of the Year<br />\nAward, but soccer was a new<br />\nsport for him.<br />\nSo what happened when he arrived at Homewood? Tierney<br />\nmust be a quick learner, and a<br />\ngood recruiter, as his first team<br />\nwound up a respectable 7-8-1,<br />\nand then in '85 they exploded out<br />\nof nowhere to a 14-3 record and<br />\na state championship.

In that<br />\nweek, the HUT will \"look at over<br />\n100 different things, maybe up to<br />\n150, which will range from nearby stars and galaxies to quasars,<br />\nthe most powerful energy sources<br />\nin the universe,\" explained<br />\nDavidsen.<br />\nThe HUT's capacities complement those of Hubble. HUT sees<br />\nthe extreme ultraviolet light that<br />\nis further on the spectrum that<br />\nwhat is visible to Hubble. One of<br />\nits goals is to search for the possible existence of an intergalactic<br />\nmedium, the material between<br />\ngalaxies. \"There may be more<br />\nmatter spread out than what we<br />\nsee in the galaxies. What is normally thought of as empty space<br />\ncould add up to most of the matter in the universe,\" revealed<br />\nDavidsen.<br />\nDavidsen explained the process<br />\nin which HUT searches for the intergalactic medium, \"HUT can<br />\nlook at distant quasars and produce certain absorption of extreme ultraviolet light while looking at the quasar. It can see if<br /><br />\nthere is evidence of matter that is<br />\notherwise invisible.\" Extreme<br />\nultraviolet light has never before<br />\nbeen collected by a telescope.<br />\nSamuel Durrance will accompahy the HUT as a payload<br />\nspecialist on the January, 1989,<br />\nSpace Shuttle mission.

Davidsen and Knox<br />\nLong, a HUT project scientist,<br />\nwere also finalists for the shuttle<br />\ntrip. As principal investigator for<br />\nHUT, Davidsen will be in the<br />\ncontrol center in Huntsville,<br />\nAlabama, to \"watch over Sam's<br />\nshoulder\" during the trip.<br />\nBefore the explosion of the<br />\nChallenger, Hopkins had planned for the HUT to go up in<br />\nMarch, 1986, November 1986,<br />\nand August, 1987. According to<br />\nDavidsen, the explosion \"has<br />\nbeen a real disaster, it delayed us<br />\n2-3 years. We are pleased to see<br />\nthem back on schedule.\"<br />\n\"We are planning for the space<br />\ntelescopes to be the only thing we<br />\nwould be doing this year,\" said<br />\nDavidsen.

They then contacted Dell<br />\nPublishers in New York, who<br />\nagreed to print it.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Hungarian inventor, beaten at his own game by<br />\ntwo college students, is suing<br />\nBelur, Whitaker, and Dell<br />\nPublishing Company for violating<br />\nhis trademark, patent, and<br /><br />\ncopyrights. \"I don't like that,\"<br />\nsaid Rubik bitterly, after first<br />\nhearing about the new book.<br />\nRubik had intended to publish his<br />\nown solution book early next<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe legal confrontation that<br />\nBelur and his friend's ingenuity<br />\nhas provoked will only create<br />\nmore media attention. The two<br />\nauthors have already been interviewed by major news agencies<br />\nin the nation and have had stories<br />\npublished in the New York Times,<br />\nthe Sun, and Newsweek<br />\nmagazine. To top it all, they<br />\nappeared on Good Morning<br />\nAmerica last Monday, November<br />\n3, but Belur wants even more.<br />\n\"I want to get on David Letterman,\" said Belur with a<br />\ncheeky grin on his face.<br />\nLetterman or not, one thing is<br />\ncertain: these two will not be<br /><br />\nwriting home for money<br />\nanymore. Their book, with all the<br />\nattention given to it, is already<br />\nselling at a best-seller rate and is<br />\nscheduled to reach the shops in<br />\nthe first week of November. That<br />\nis, unless Rubik gets his way.<br />\nRubik will try and delay the<br />\nrelease of the book to the general<br />\npublic with legal action. \"It's my<br />\nidea, my work,\" said the inventor. \"It's completely unauthorized. I'm disappointed and surprised the authors or the publishers<br />\ndidn't contact me.\"<br />\nThe literary agents and<br />\npublishers of Belur declined to<br />\ncomment, but a spokesman for<br />\nthe puzzle's manufacturers, Matchbox Toys U.S.A. proclaimed,<br />\n\"They're using someone else's<br />\nwork as a launching pad. We<br />\nhave every intention of protecting<br />\nnot only our patent, but also the<br /><br />\nname that goes with it.\"<br />\nBelur first got the idea for the<br />\nbook when he heard about the<br />\npuzzle over the radio this summer. He remembered that after<br />\nthe \"Rubik's Cube\u2014 was released, there were three solution<br />\nbooks to the puzzle on the New<br />\nYork Times Best-Seller list<br />\nfollowing Christmas. \"I knew<br />\nsomebody was going to write a<br />\nbook and somebody was going to<br />\nhave a bestseller. I figured it<br />\nmight as well be me,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nThe students started a<br />\nscavenger hunt for a copy of the<br />\npuzzle in late August, and finally received a promotional copy on<br />\nSept. 22. They then started their<br />\nmarathon quest for the solution,<br />\nwhich eventually took them 50<br />\nhours. Belur found an agent<br />\nthrough a friend in a Penn<br /><br />\ncafeteria. Dell, a division of<br />\nDoubleday, agreed to publish it,<br />\nand the rest became a whirlwind<br />\ntour in the fast lane, with almost<br />\ndaily trips to New York, T.V.<br />\nand newspaper interviews, and<br />\nautograph hounds.<br />\nJames Stein, the students' agent<br />\nexplained, \"It's a fantasy come<br />\ntrue.

The word of administrators and Trustees on any<br />\nmatter before them must be<br />\nauthoritative, according to this<br />\nview; they are, after all, in positions of authority. Should any<br />\nconfusion persist, we are asked to<br />\nlook to who owns the place. The<br />\ncandidates most frequently put<br />\nforward are the Trustees (they<br />\ndon't have to work, you never see<br />\nthem, and they have all that<br />\npower\u2014they must be the<br />\nowners!).<br />\nAll complaints ultimately<br />\nreside in the(by the no means unpolitical) aesthetic dimension.<br />\nVisible protest is irritating; deviant actions and words disturb<br />\nthe mall-like beauty of the campus.

The environment promoted and defended by Coalition<br />\ndetractors is, in the final analysis,<br />\nsuffocatingly anti-intellectual.<br /><br />\nsensus on University divestiture.<br />\nThe Student Council's condemnation was unfortunate in that it occurred before it had knowledge of<br />\nthe whole situation leading to the<br />\noccupation of the University administration building. Scott FitzGerald, the Sophomore Class<br />\nPresident, who proposed the<br />\nresolution, said, \"I acted in ignorance\" (I invite you to check<br />\nthis quotation with your reporter),<br />\nand that he would not have written the resolution had he known<br />\nbefore what he knew after his<br />\nmeeting with the Coalition. Regrettably, the News-Letter did<br />\nnothing to inform its readers of<br />\nthe nature of the Student Council<br />\ncondemnation, nor of its subsequent retraction by its author.<br />\nI would also like to inquire why<br />\nthe News-Letter chose not to print<br />\nits interview of Coalition<br />\nmembers conducted during the<br />\nfirst days of the occupation. The<br />\nmedia should strive to accurately<br />\nreport both sides of an event, not<br />\nsimply the reactions of the majority in order to facilitate an<br />\nunderstanding of opposing<br />\nmethods.<br /><br />\nStephen En<br /><br />\nSouth Africa 2<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nContinued on Page 14<br /><br />\nLast week's article on the Student Council's condemnation of<br />\nthe Coalition's occupation of<br />\nMandela Hall was disturbingly<br />\ninaccurate in that it failed to<br />\nreport the outcome of the ensuing meeting between the Student<br />\nCouncil and the Coalition.

The Coalition neither is<br />\nnor intends to be a 60's revival.<br />\nBut we find that label, often applied by our critics, a humorous<br />\none and are quite willing to play<br />\nwith it. The same goes for the<br />\nposter asking if people were sick<br />\nof the ugly shanties. We consider<br />\ntheir ugliness exactly the point<br />\nand find it amusing that so many<br />\nseem to believe politics should be<br />\nsubjugated to aesthetics. Had our<br />\ndemand for total divestment been<br />\nmet the shanties would be gone<br />\nalready.

You're 'bout as sharp as a<br />\nbowling ball.\"<br />\nSidney Maskit<br /><br />\nSouth Africa 4<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe News-Letter's coverage of<br />\nthe Trustee's vote on divestment<br />\nand the Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica's response failed to ask<br />\nwhy the Coalition's protest took<br />\nthe form it did. Everyone knew<br />\nthat the Coalition would have to<br />\ntake action on a no-divestment<br />\nvote. Why these particular actions? (For those commuting<br />\nfrom another planet, members of<br />\nthe Coalition picketed the<br />\nTrustees' meeting, impeded the<br />\nexit of those Trustees who tried<br />\nto leave early, yelled at them, catcalled during the subsequent press<br />\nconference, and then occupied the<br />\nadministration building.)<br />\nAs a member of the Coalition,<br />\nbut not writing at the behest of the<br />\nCoalition, I strongly believe the<br />\nHopkins community deserves an<br />\nexplanation of those actions the<br />\nNews-Letter labeled shameful.<br />\nThe Trustees encountered such<br />\na rude response because they<br />\ndealt with the student body in bad<br />\nfaith. No Trustee sitting on the<br />\nboard of a company doing<br />\nbusiness in South Africa disqualified himself from voting on<br /><br />\ndivestment. At the meeting they<br />\ncontinued to act without shame.<br />\nSeveral Trustees attempted to<br />\nleave the meeting early without<br />\nbeing noticed. They took a back<br />\nway. They did so without asking<br />\nthe Coalition to move so they<br />\ncould leave through the normal<br />\nexit. (Head of Security Robert<br />\nLarkin did in fact ask former<br />\nCoalition co-chairman Paul<br />\nGenest if we intended to block the<br />\nTrustees' way after their meeting<br />\nhad ended. Paul told him no.) As<br />\nthose Trustees left they refused to<br />\ntell us the results of their deliberation. Though the News-Letter<br />\ndoes not make this clear, the<br />\noverwhelming cries of Coalition<br />\nmembers as those Trustees left<br />\nwere, \"What's the vote?\" and<br />\n\"You're sneaking out the back<br />\nway,\" as this appeared to be what<br />\nthey were doing. Is it any wonder<br />\nthat we then moved to block their<br />\nexit? Our actions have always<br />\nbeen open and honest; their actions have never been so. Both the<br />\ncurses hurled at the Trustees as<br />\nthey announced their investment<br />\nchoice and subsequent occupation<br />\nof Mandela Hall reflected the<br />\nCoalition's immense frustration at<br />\nthe Trustees' disingenuous dealings, both in content and style. It<br />\nmust be remembered that the<br />\nCoalition's actions were very<br />\nmuch a response to a situation<br />\ndevised by the Trustees.<br />\nDan Schechter, Class of '87<br /><br />\nTHE<br />\nBRITISH<br />\nARE<br />\nCOMIN<br /><br />\nSunny's crossed the ocean to bring you this<br />\nGENUINE SURPLUS BRITISH<br />\nCOMMANDO SWEATER, made of<br />\n100% virgin wool in a heavy ribknit for extra warmth.

If the Council<br />\nmembers had indeed approached<br />\nthe Coalition before taking their<br />\nvote, perhaps they could have at<br />\nthe very least understood why the<br />\nCoalition was present in Garland.<br />\n(To Sa Surmelli's statement that<br />\nthe Coalition should have come to<br />\nthe Council, we respond that we<br />\nwould have, had we known that<br />\nthe issue was to be on the table.)<br />\nInstead, the Coalition's actions<br />\nwere written off as being merely<br />\n\"disruptive.\" And without pausing to consider whom the Coalition represented, the Council<br />\nassumed that the Coalition was<br />\ndeliberately misleading the<br />\nmedia.<br />\nIf our two groups had met<br />\n(before the vote), perhaps we<br />\ncould have explained why we felt<br />\nthat many Trustees were unequivocally acting in conflict of interest, and how we felt that the<br />\nTrustees had acted in bad faith by<br />\npromising a yes/no vote on full<br />\ndivestment and then voting only<br />\non a compromised package. And<br />\nperhaps we could have stated that<br />\nthe entire sum of these and other<br />\ncircumstances has forced us to<br />\nescalate our level of activity until our concerns can be adequately addressed.<br />\nAnd maybe, if there had been<br />\ncontact prior to the resolution, the<br />\nmembers of the Student Council<br />\ncould have noted that we occupied the Administration<br />\nbuilding specifically so as not to<br />\ninterfere with the academic<br />\ngoings-on of a student's life and<br />\nas such were confronting only the<br />\npeople to whom our petitions are<br />\naddressed.<br />\nIn closing, however, I would<br />\nlike to commend the efforts of<br />\nCouncil member Winston<br />\nVaughan for attempting to promote dialogue before the vote,<br />\nand to thank Oneeka Williams for<br />\nasserting that \"the Coalition\" is<br />\nnot \"deliberately trying to bias<br />\nthe press.\"<br />\nM.Bijoy Mathew<br /><br />\nSouth Africa 6<br /><br />\n50<br /><br />\nOFF<br />\nTHE BRITISH<br />\nI<br />\nI COMMANDO SWEATER<br />\n\u2022 w/ this coupon<br />\nLimit 2 per person<br />\n.<br />\n1<br />\nI Exp. 1/31/87<br />\n111111.1111111111110 \u2014<br /><br />\nS<br />\nSIVN8<br />\nN<br /><br />\ne.<br /><br />\nVIWIIIS<br />\n\u00b0Lint<br />\nS<br /><br />\nGtee<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn all the recent controversy<br />\nsurrounding the JHU Coalition<br />\nfor a Free South Africa, it is important to remember that there<br />\nare two very distinct issues<br />\ninvolved\u2014the actions of the<br />\nCoalition and divestment itself.<br />\nMany students have voiced the<br />\nopinion that, while they favor<br />\ndivestment, they are opposed to<br />\nthe means the Coalition has used<br />\nto pressure the Trustees to divest.<br />\nThe problem with this quite<br />\nreasonable position is that it<br />\nmoves the focus of attention.froth<br />\ndiVestment, which should be the<br /><br />\nprimary issue at hand, to the<br />\nCoalition.

But if these members<br />\ndo favor divestment, why don't<br />\nthey suggest to the Coalition<br />\nother, more acceptable, means of<br />\nachieving this important end? The<br />\nCoalition has been, and is, willing to listen and respond to opinions from outside of its ranks.<br />\nAnyone can come to a Coalition<br />\nmeeting, and those with serious<br />\nsuggestions should not fear<br />\nridicule or lack of attention.<br />\nThe Coalition, though, seems<br />\nto be the only group on campus<br />\nwith any strategy for achieving<br />\ndivestment. It appears that those<br />\nfavoring divestment and opposing<br />\nthe Coalition are content to sit<br />\naround and talk about the evils of<br />\napartheid instead of actually doing anything. If for nothing else,<br />\nthe Coalition should be appreciated for making an effort to<br />\nchange the status quo in favor of<br />\nthe oppressed. It may, in the opinions of some, have made some<br />\ntactical errors, but at least it is doing something.<br />\nI urge the students who share<br />\nthe Coalition's concern for the<br />\nvictims of apartheid to put aside<br />\ntheir reservations and talk to<br />\nsome Coalition members about<br />\ndivestment.

In that<br />\nsense, magic is a sort of<br /><br />\ndition, they took over some native<br />\ndeities and rejected those which<br />\nseemed \"truly outlandish.\"<br />\nHowever, these rejected gods<br />\ncontinued to live on as a form of<br />\nwitchcraft.<br />\nThe most important records<br />\nfrom history are the magical<br />\npapyri\u2014enormous scrolls, the<br />\nfirst of which was found in an<br />\nEgyptian magician's tomb in<br />\n1830.

The<br />\n1940's farce by Joseph Kesselring remains a stodgy classic in<br />\nold-fashioned American comedy.<br />\nIn the Barnstormers' production,<br />\nthe play moves a little stiffly<br />\naround the joints, but old as it is,<br />\nit gets the laughs out.<br />\nThe first thing to notice is Andy Angelino's wonderful set. Not<br />\nonly is there a wall lined with<br />\nbookcases, paintings, and three<br />\nworking doors, but there is actually a second floor--complete<br />\nwith a carpeted staircase. The<br />\nListening/Viewing<br />\nRoom<br />\n(designed for neither listening nor<br />\nviewing) is a terrible theater, but<br />\nthe Arsenic set transcends even<br />\nthat.<br />\nThe play begins in the Brewster<br />\nhome in Brooklyn. Abby<br />\nBrewster (Kelli Midgley) and her<br />\nsister Martha (Alice Griffin) live<br />\nin the house taking care of their<br />\nnephew Teddy (Scott McNamee).<br />\nAbby and Martha make chicken<br />\nbroth for sick neighbors and help<br /><br />\nwhenever they can, and Teddy<br />\nthinks that he is Theodore<br />\nRoosevelt. Policemen come over<br />\nto collect old toys for the<br />\nChristmas fund, and there is a<br />\ndead body in the window seat. It's<br />\nas nice and cozy as Our Town<br />\nturned inside out.<br />\nThe two aunts are lively, sweet<br />\nand overly bubbly, as if they had<br />\nstepped out from an imitation<br />\nNorman Rockwell. But Abby and<br />\nMartha also mix elderberry wine<br />\nwith arsenic and cyanide, and<br />\nfeed it to lonely old men looking<br />\nto rent a room. They've been doing this some while and there are<br />\nnow eleven bodies in the cellar,<br />\nin graves dug by Teddy, who<br />\nthinks he is digging locks for the<br />\nPanama Canal. Another nephew,<br />\nMortimer (Vince Li Cata) is a<br />\ntheater critic and sane (if one can<br />\nbe both). He is in love with the<br />\nPreacher's daughter, Elaine<br />\n(Carol Gerry). Mortimer finds<br />\nout about the elderberry wine and<br />\ndecides it is time to stop it. As he<br />\nputs it: \"This is becoming a very<br />\nbad habit.\"<br />\nArsenic and Old Lace is a play<br />\nof double-takes; the ordinary is<br />\nshifted just slightly out of focus.<br />\nThe great joy is the spoof of<br />\nmysteries\u2014the audience can<br />\nrelish in knowing something the<br />\nactors don't. Mortimer is a real<br />\nsharp-tongued journalist in the<br />\ntradition of The Front Page. Li<br />\nCata plays him as a nervous,<br />\nquirky intellectual. He makes<br /><br />\nwonderful cracks about criticism,<br />\nsuch as, \"I can save time if I<br />\nwrite my review on the way to the<br />\ntheater.\" Or he says to a colleague, \"I was just feeling a<br />\nbit. . .Pirandellish.\"<br />\nIn Act Two, the other nephew<br />\ncomes home. Jonathan Brewster<br />\n(Chris Barrett) returns after<br />\ntraveling the world murdering<br />\npeople. He returns with a jumpy<br />\nsurgeon known as Dr. Einstein<br />\n(Jeremy Golub). In the film,<br />\nEinstein was played by Peter<br />\nLorre, but Golub makes the part<br />\nhis own. Jonathan, who was<br />\nmade to look like Boris Karloff<br />\nafter some of Einstein's plastic<br />\nsurgery, wants to move back<br />\nhome and set up a plastic surgery<br />\nshop. \"Practically everybody in<br />\nBrooklyn needs a new face,\" he<br />\nexplains. These two have brought<br />\ntheir own corpse, and the comedy<br />\nensues.<br />\nThe aunts work in their own<br />\nperfectly logical fashion,<br />\nendeavoring to help friendless old<br />\ngentlemen find \"peace.\" When<br />\nMortimer says, \"There are 12<br />\nmen in the cellar and you admit<br />\nyou've poisoned them,\" Abby<br />\nreplies: \"Yes, I did. But I<br />\nwouldn't stoop to lying.\"<br />\nMidgley's great asset is her<br />\nvoice, fluttering like the old lace<br />\ndecorating her home. She is just<br />\na slightly better comedienne than<br />\nGriffin, who nevertheless is an<br />\nexcellent, if slightly posed, actress. When the twelfth body is<br /><br />\nhidden in the window seat, they<br />\ntell Teddy to keep it a secret. He<br />\nthinks a moment, then<br />\nMcNamee's eyes light up, \"A<br />\nstate secret?\" McNamee is a<br />\nvery funny Teddy, not overplaying the role, yet keeping him off<br />\nthe wall enough so that the audience looks forward to his next<br />\nentrance.<br />\nMortimer tries to explain to<br />\nElaine that he can't marry her<br />\nbecause of his heritage. \"Insanity runs in my family. In fact, it<br />\npractically gallops.\" There is<br />\ngood chemistry between them,<br />\nthough Li Cata (with his Jimmy<br />\nStewart awkwardness) is at first<br />\noverpowered by Gerry. Gerry<br />\ncomes on strong with her be-bop<br />\nhairstyle and expressive mouth.<br />\nLi Cata, with wild facial expressions, voice cracking and<br />\nbrowline jumping, is a frantically witty Mortimer, yet he lacks<br />\nthe presence to make a realistic<br />\nfoil for Jonathan.<br />\nAs Jonathan, Chris Barrett<br />\nfumes, sneers and boils. Unfortunately the play doesn't allow for<br />\nhis character to explode, and he<br />\nis kept within a limited range. Except for some trouble with his<br />\nlines, Barrett comes off well. Accolades are due for Jeremy<br />\nGolub, a physical actor par excellence. With eyebrows twitching and eyes rolling, Golub<br />\nsteals almost every scene he is in.<br />\nAll eyes are on Golub's mimicking of Elaine as Jonathan<br /><br />\nthreatens her, and the funniest<br />\nscene of the night is when Einstein tries to get out of the window<br />\nseat.<br />\nThe supporting cast is competent although the play gives them<br />\nlittle in the way of character.<br />\nGlenn White is sufficiently suffocating as a playwriting cop, and<br />\nJason Hanson is bothersome as a<br />\npompous policemen with an innocuous smirk plastered to his<br />\nface. The script itself drags a little in parts. Arsenic really is too<br />\nlong a play, but one sits through<br />\nit to see some fine examples of<br />\nhumor, as when Jonathan<br />\ndiscovers that the aunts have killed twelve men, just as he has.<br />\n\"Johnny,\" Einstein says,<br />\n\"We've been chased all over the<br />\nworld. And they [Abby and Martha] stayed in Brooklyn and did<br />\njust as good as you.\"<br />\nDirector David Deboy (who<br />\ndid last fall's Hot L Baltimore: the<br />\nBarnstormers' choice of plays<br />\nneeds work) paces it a bit too<br />\nslowly. There need to be more<br />\ncoincidences, as when Elaine hits<br />\nJonathan in the face with the<br />\ndoor. Besides some faltering<br />\nlights and some fragile props, the<br />\nproduction runs smoothly. Punch<br />\nand cookies during the intermission is a nice touch\u2014the Barnstormers have turned in a class<br />\nact. So, could theater at Hopkins<br />\nfinally becoming into its own?<br />\nMaybe, but first, have a glass of<br />\nelderberry wine.<br /><br />\nHare's Map of the World<br />\nby Laurah Limbrick<br />\n\"A Map of the World.\" Alexander Zale, Thomas Gibson, Lorraine Toussaint, Linda Cook;<br />\nDirected by Stan Wojewodski, Jr.<br />\n\"A Map of the World\" is a<br />\nvery tricky play. Set at a<br />\nUNESCO conference in 1978<br />\nBombay and the present, it poses<br />\nsome very difficult questions.<br />\nPlaywright David Hare, the man<br />\nwho brought us \"Plenty\" and<br /><br />\n\"Wetherby,\" analyzes several<br />\nThird World problems.<br />\nAt first, we are led to believe<br />\nthat we are actually at the conference, but it soon becomes apparent that we are actually on the<br />\nset of a movie being made years<br />\nlater. The movie is based on the<br />\nmemoirs of Victor Mehta (Alexander Zale), a conservative and<br />\ncontroversial Indian novelist who<br />\nwas brought up in England. The<br />\nfact that Hare has chosen to call<br />\nhim \"Mehta\" is interesting in the<br /><br />\nRichard Anderson<br /><br />\nNow playing at Center Stage, David Hare's A Map of the World<br /><br />\n\"A play of political and sexual intrigue\"<br /><br />\n\"meta-fiction\" context of the<br />\nplay. The play keeps moving<br />\nfrom 1978 to the present, and<br />\neventually the line between the<br />\ntwo becomes so blurred that not<br />\nonly can we not tell which time<br />\nwe're in, it doesn't really seem to<br />\nmatter.<br />\nBilled as \"a play of political<br />\nand sexual intrigue,\" it certainly<br />\ndelivers, as young actress Peggy<br />\nWhitton (Linda Cook) offers<br />\nherself as the prize in a debate<br />\nMehta and idealistic<br />\njournalist Stephen Andrews<br />\n(Thomas Gibson) which is<br />\nmoderated by hard-nosed television correspondent Elaine Le<br />\nFanu (Lorraine Toussaint). Years<br />\nlater, when the film is being<br />\nmade, Peggy visits the set and is<br />\nso upset by the portrayal of ller<br />\ncharacter that she asks Mehta to<br />\nhave the production stopped.<br />\nPeggy has matured into a woman<br />\nwho is afraid of growing old and<br />\nafraid of her past.<br />\nThe play moves extremely<br />\nquickly under the direction of<br />\nStan Wojewodski; it's tight and<br />\ncompact. The cast works well<br />\ntogether, although there is occasionally a slight tendency to<br />\noveremote. Overall the performances are very good, especially Alexander Zale as Mehta.<br />\n\"A Map of the World\" is playing at Center Stage through<br />\nNovember 30; for tickets or more<br />\ninformation, call the Center Stage<br />\nBox Office \u00e1t332-0033.<br /><br />\nJulian Kemp<br /><br />\nLois Shapiro, who played with the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra Sunday.<br /><br />\nHSO Concert<br /><br />\nby Jason Hanson<br /><br />\nthose troublesome intonation proDirection.

The<br />\nmuscular execution of the piece<br />\nwas manifest in every section of<br />\nthe orchestra. The first movement, Allegro, marked by its<br />\nbold, bright theme was dispatched masterfully.

Dr. Michael Colvin, a<br />\nclinical researcher, makes rounds<br />\nas an attending physician in the<br />\nhospital in the mornings and<br />\nevenings and then contributes the<br />\nremainder of the day leading a<br />\ncontinuing analysis of new cancer<br />\ndrugs.

Dr. Colvin's lab tests<br />\nfrom four to five drugs each year.<br />\nCancer research facilities like<br />\nthose at JHMI are often criticized for wasting funds with little or<br />\nno results. In fact, great strides<br />\nhave been made in the last fifteen<br />\nyears.

Patients who<br />\nonce had no hope of survival<br />\nfrom testicular cancer can now be<br />\ncured with almost 80% success.<br />\nThese are only a few of the fantastic accomplishments of physicians and scientists around the<br />\nworld. At Johns Hopkins, where<br />\nthe stress of the research is on<br />\nleukemia and lymphomas, a<br />\nbreakthrough for treating cancer<br />\nof the bone marrow has gained<br /><br />\nrecognition.<br />\nworld-wide<br />\nDeveloped by Dr. George Santos,<br />\nthis method replaces the previous<br />\nmethod which involved a marrow<br />\ntransplant from a sibling, only<br />\n30-50% successful. The new<br />\nmethod purges the patient's own<br />\nbone marrow removing the<br />\ntumorous cells and then replacing<br />\nthe purged marrow back in the<br />\npatient. This technique has shown<br />\nvery encouraging results, and the<br />\ningenious purging technique of<br />\nthe bone marrow has been applauded by cancer researchers<br />\neverywhere.<br />\nThere is no doubt that the true<br />\nexcitement of cancer research is<br />\nin the prospects for the future.<br />\nWith each day, the prospects approach realization. Researchers at<br />\nthe Oncology and Pharmacology<br />\nCenter have become leaders in<br />\nthe field, and some fascinating<br />\nprospects are being studied and<br />\ntested at this time. One such prospect is the promising compound<br />\nbeing developed by Dr. Steve<br />\nBaylin. The compound is based<br />\non the principle of making the<br />\ntumor cell develop properly or<br />\ndifferentiate as a healthy cell<br />\nwould, instead of the uncontrolled division present in tumor cells.<br />\nThis differentiating compound, in<br /><br />\neffect, a \"gene control\" would<br />\nslow or even stop the cancer process of uncontrolled cell division.<br />\nAnother prospect for the future<br />\nis the promising anti-tumor drug,<br />\ntumor necrosis factor, which has<br />\nshown amazing success in animal<br />\ntissue. Leading these tests are Dr.<br />\nRoss Donehower and Dr. David<br />\nS. Ettinger. Analysis of this promising drug continues as human<br />\ntests have just been approved.<br />\nStill another prospect is tackling<br />\nthe problem of tumor cells that<br />\nbecome resistant to chemical<br />\ntherapy. According to Dr. Colvin, the resistance may be due to<br />\nthe activation of dormant enzymes by the tumor cell. Researchers are now developing<br />\nbiochemical techniques to detect<br />\nand understand chemical resistant<br />\ntumor cells.<br />\nAnother technique being<br />\nstudied by Dr. Stanley Order involves tagging antibodies, the<br />\nnatural<br />\ndefense<br />\nbody's<br />\nmechanism, with radioactive<br />\nchemicals in order to eliminate<br />\ntumor cells more effectively.<br />\nNo one can deny that advances<br />\nin the field of cancer research are<br />\nbeing made.

Brody and J. Thompson<br />\nWhen Bill Tierney picked up<br />\nthe phone last Sunday night, he<br />\nheard the words he had been<br />\nwaiting to hear since he began<br />\ncoaching varsity soccer three<br />\nyears ago, words a Hopkins soccer team had not heard since<br />\n1975, words that seemed highly<br />\nimprobable at the beginning of<br />\nthe season when the \"Hooters\"<br />\nhad a record of 0-1-1 and had key<br />\ninjuries to their backfield\u2014The<br />\nJohns Hopkins men's varsity soccer team had made the NCAA<br />\nplayoffs.<br />\nThe team will be travelling<br />\ndown to Greensboro, North<br />\nCarolina to play their first division HI playoff game at 1 pm. this<br />\nSunday (directions available at<br />\nthe Athletic Center). The playoffs<br />\nare composed of six regions with<br />\nfour teams competing in each<br />\nregion in a single elimination<br />\ntournament. The \"Hooters\" are<br />\nranked fourth in their region and<br />\nare playing North Carolina,<br />\nGreensboro, the number one<br />\nranked team in the region. The<br />\nGreensboro Spartans are certainly<br />\nformidable competition. They<br />\nwon the National Division III title last year and are attempting to<br />\npick up the honors for the fourth<br />\ntime in the last five years.<br />\nBased on their recent performance, though, this Hopkins<br />\nteam is in excellent shape after<br />\nwinning two big games at the end<br />\nof the regular season to top off a<br />\n14 game winning streak. The first<br />\nof these came last Friday night<br />\nagainst Washington College.<br />\nThings looked tight with Hopkins<br />\nneeding to win and win big over<br />\nWashington to receive a bid to the<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nJohn Horner<br /><br />\nAfter a decade of mediocrity, the Hooters have risen from nowhere to take the MAC Southern title and now are headed for the Division III playoffs.<br />\nNCAA division III championship<br />\ntournament. But, as Ray Giuriceo<br />\ndescribes it, \"this was the most<br />\nfired up I've ever seen the team.\"<br />\nIt showed. Hopkins outshot their<br />\nopponents 31-1 and won 4-0.<br />\nTeamwork was key in this victory<br />\nwith 8 players having a hand<br />\neither by scoring or having the<br />\nassist, in the four goals scored.<br /><br />\nThe second big win was this<br />\nTuesday against Gettysburg.<br />\nWith the MAC Southern Division<br />\nChampionship on the line, the<br />\nHooters came through with the<br />\nvictory. Even though their<br />\nleading scorer Craig Weinstein<br />\ndidn't get a goal (he did get an<br />\nassist) the rest of the team<br />\ncapitalized on the opposition's at-<br /><br />\ntention to Weinstein and netted 4 a 2-0 lead with only 12 seconds<br />\nbig goals on their way to a 4-0 on the clock.<br />\nwin. Perhaps the biggest goal<br />\nThese two wins capped off a<br />\ncame near the end of the first fine 14-1-I regular season record,<br />\nhalf. With the ball apparently 8-0 at home.

And with a 14-1-1<br />\nrecord and confidence that's skyhigh, they could go even further.<br />\nEven if the Hooters do falter on<br />\nSunday, though, it will hardly put<br />\na damper on what has been a<br />\nseason to remember. After all,<br />\nHopkins has been anything but a<br />\nsoccer powerhouse in recent<br />\nyears. In 1975, when the word<br />\n\"Hooter\" was probably in no<br />\nplayer's vocabulary, Hopkins<br />\nsent a soccer team to the NCAA's<br />\nFinal Four with a 13-1-1 record.<br />\nThe squad lost a 1-0 heartbreaker<br />\nin overtime to Brockport St., and<br />\nthen fell to Ohio Wesleyan in a<br />\nconsolation match. That was<br />\nabout it for the sport here, as the<br />\nJays didn't have another winning<br />\nseason until 1985. In the meantime, the school has won six<br />\nlacrosse titles, a swimming championship, and, of course, countless fencing crowns.<br />\nThe improbable turnaround actually began two summers ago<br />\nwhen Athletic Director Bob Scott<br />\nimported Bill Tierney in from the<br />\nRochester Institute of Technology<br />\nto be primarily an assistant<br />\n$ #<br />\nj<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nlacrosse coach, and as an afterthought, the head man for soccer.<br />\nTierney had already proven his<br />\nexpertise in the former, having<br />\nled an unheralded R.I.T. lax team<br />\ninto the NCAA's and receiving<br />\nthe Division III Coach of the Year<br />\nAward, but soccer was a new<br />\nsport for him.<br />\nSo what happened when he arrived at Homewood? Tierney<br />\nmust be a quick learner, and a<br />\ngood recruiter, as his first team<br />\nwound up a respectable 7-8-1,<br />\nand then in '85 they exploded out<br />\nof nowhere to a 14-3 record and<br />\na state championship. One goal<br />\nwent unfulfilled, however...that<br />\nelusive NCAA bid.<br />\nThe Hooters got off to a sluggish start this season, losing the<br />\nopener 2-0 to ChristopherNewport and then settling for a<br />\n4-4 tie against N.C. Wesleyan<br />\nafter holding a 3-0 lead at one<br />\npoint. Though depressing at the<br />\ntime, that deadlock may have lit<br />\nthe spark for the Blue Jays, for<br />\nsince that day they have reeled off<br />\n14 straight wins, and counting.<br />\nLike all great teams, the<br />\nHooters have done it with<br />\ndefense.
