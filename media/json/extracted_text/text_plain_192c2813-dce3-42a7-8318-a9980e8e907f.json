The Dean<br />\nhimself and the Student Council<br />\nthink otherwise and every Hopkins<br />\nman that has the real welfare of our<br />\ncollege at heart hopes that they are<br />\nright in their stand.<br />\nIt certainly is to be deplored that<br />\nany suspicion of dishonesty should<br />\nbe even thought of in an institution such as ours. The only way by<br />\nwhich talk of this character may<br />\nbe stopped is to show the authors<br />\nof these stories that the condition<br />\ndoes not exist by holding the June<br />\nExaminations so that no shadow of<br />\ncheating can possibly be conjured<br />\nup by any person who is waiting to<br />\ngrasp the vestige of an irregularity<br />\nto cry out the failure of the Honor<br />\nSystem.<br />\n<br />\nThe Debating Council, at a recent meeting, elected R.\u2022 Dorsey<br />\nWatkins, '22, president, and Lawrence B.

An excess of zeal on .the part of paid entertainers apparently resulted in a<br />\ntype of vaudeville out of place in a<br />\ngathering of college men and distasteful to practically all of the<br />\nguests. There is one sure way to<br />\nprevent a recurrence of this sort of<br />\nthing at future class dinners and<br />\nthat is a return to the tradition of<br />\nformer years\u2014class dinners at<br />\nwhich there are no paid entertainers. If tired business men want .to<br />\nbe cheered and soothed at their<br />\ngatherings by female dancers and<br />\nmonologists imported from the Gayety Theater that is their affairs;<br />\nbut college men, who are living the<br />\nintellectual life ought certainly to<br />\nhave wit and good fellowship<br />\nenough to make such a recourse inadequate and unnecessary. Consequently, the Omicron Delta Kappa<br />\nSociety speaking, it firmly believes,<br />\nfor the best public opinion on the<br />\ncampus, urges upon the classes concerned the adoption for next year<br />\nof a policy that will make impossible such criticism as has been going about recently.<br />\nA Co \\I MITTEE OF THE 0.

An excess of zeal on .the part of paid entertainers apparently resulted in a<br />\ntype of vaudeville out of place in a<br />\ngathering of college men and distasteful to practically all of the<br />\nguests. There is one sure way to<br />\nprevent a recurrence of this sort of<br />\nthing at future class dinners and<br />\nthat is a return to the tradition of<br />\nformer years\u2014class dinners at<br />\nwhich there are no paid entertainers. If tired business men want .to<br />\nbe cheered and soothed at their<br />\ngatherings by female dancers and<br />\nmonologists imported from the Gayety Theater that is their affairs;<br />\nbut college men, who are living the<br />\nintellectual life ought certainly to<br />\nhave wit and good fellowship<br />\nenough to make such a recourse inadequate and unnecessary. Consequently, the Omicron Delta Kappa<br />\nSociety speaking, it firmly believes,<br />\nfor the best public opinion on the<br />\ncampus, urges upon the classes concerned the adoption for next year<br />\nof a policy that will make impossible such criticism as has been going about recently.<br />\nA Co \\I MITTEE OF THE 0. D. K.<br />\nALL HONOR OR NO HONOR?<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS.<br /><br />\nWe must have a system either<br />\nentirely with Or without honor. If<br />\nwe have the first, the student should<br />\nbe given no reason to believe that<br />\nthere is any doubt of his honor.<br />\nThe signing of pledge slips and the<br />\noccasional supervision by \"watchmen\" should be entirely done away<br />\nwith. Both of these are blots on<br />\nour present system and are a constant remihder of a lurking distrust<br />\non the part of our faculty.<br />\nA man should be free to takz.\u2022<br />\nan exam in any room that he wishes.<br />\nOne of the best proofs that I<br />\nhave ever seen of the efficiency of<br />\nthe system occurred last year. With<br />\nsix other students of the same<br />\ncourse, all of them average-minded<br />\nmembers of the student body, I left<br />\nan examination room and took the<br />\nexam, in a cooler and quieter room<br />\naway from the distracting gazes of<br />\nsome fifty classmates. I can honestly say that there was not even<br />\nthe least hint of help given or received in the room during the entire examination.<br />\nIn adopting.a 100 per cent. honor<br />\nsystem we are not experimenting;<br />\nwe are using a system that has been<br />\ntried and found successful in hundreds of other institutions.<br />\nFor my part I shall be happy to<br />\nsee the time when Hopkins joins<br />\nthis progressive group and leaves<br />\nbehind the elementary school tacD.

Lovejoy, who is<br />\nresponsible for the establishment of<br />\nthe course, will supervise the instruction, with the assistance of instructors from several of the other<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nIt is believed that this course,<br />\nwhich is regarded as unique in college curricula, will serve to better<br />\nfit the entering student for his coming work.<br /><br />\nAmong the subjects covered will<br />\nbe methods of study, principles of<br />\nlogical reasoning, elementary statistical methods, observation of<br />\nphysical fact, how scientific theory<br />\nis built up and the ideals and aims<br />\nof science.<br />\n.
