He was ordered to Camp<br />\nGreenleaf in Georgia for a brief<br />\nperiod of training, at the end of<br />\nwhich time he was sent to Camp<br />\nBenning at Columbus, Ga., as the<br />\ncamp sanitary engineer. There he<br />\ncontracted influenza in a particularly virulent form, which developed into bronchial pneumonia,<br />\nfrom which he died.

Plans for the<br />\nseason are in process of formulation under the guidance of the<br />\nDebating Council. The continuance of the old triangle with University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina is being<br />\nconsidered, but several challenges<br />\nfrom other colleges have been received.

A. T. C. and those who have<br />\nreturned from the army concerning the conversion of the Government insurance into some other<br />\nform. Many have been undecided<br />\nwhether to retain the insurance,<br />\nor let it lapse. The latter course,<br />\nunless positively necessary, would<br />\nbe most unwise. The Government<br />\nhas adopted a plan of carrying the<br />\nconverted policies, instead of having them taken over within a period of five years by private companies.<br />\nThrough this plan, the policyholders will share in dividends,<br />\nand all profits of over 3/<br />\n1<br />\n2 per<br />\ncent, will go into dividends. The<br />\nreserves will be invested in Government securities, which usually<br />\nbear 41/2 per cent.; hence, it is<br />\nthought that our former soldiers<br />\nwill periodically be recipients of<br />\nreasonably large dividends. Moreover, the premiums, which will<br />\nsoon be collected through postmasters in each community, will<br />\nbe far lower than any private concern could offer. Keep your insurance for the full amount, then,<br />\nand as soon as the rates are announced, choose one of the six<br />\nforms of insurance offered.

It<br />\nis not for us to supplement the eloquent tributes, which were then<br />\npaid him. They were many, for<br />\nhe was as universally loved, as he<br />\nwas widely known.

Why is the Government adding to its already colossal expenses by establishing even more<br />\nR. 0. T. C. units than it maintained last year? It is clear that<br />\nreadiness for emergencies in this<br />\nchaotic state of the world will be<br />\ninsured, and the Government looks<br />\nto the college men for officer material.

When he entered the Johns Hopkins Graduate Department,<br />\nthe University was but ten years old. Professor Smith's account gives us a<br />\nstriking picture of the down-town buildings and some of the \"old school\" men:<br />\n<br />\n\"It was nearly midnight when I reached Baltimore and had established myself at the Eutaw House. The next morning I approached<br />\nthe desk_ and modestly inquired of the clerk the whereabouts of Johns<br />\nHopkins University. He seemed to me a stern and haughty man. And<br />\nhis only reply to my question was,'Oh, Jim!' For the moment I was<br />\nboth startled and bewildered. It was the first time I had ever heard<br />\nthis local use of 'Oh' with the vocative, and I feared that he was either<br />\nangry or in pain. I partially realized my mistake as soon as a young<br />\nnegro rose up from one of those long settees which every American<br />\nhotel keeps for the use of bellboys, and strolled casually over to the<br />\ndesk. 'Jim,' repeated the haughty one, 'where's the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity?' His rendition of the name as well as the question itself<br />\nat once suggested to me that he too must have appeared in Baltimore<br />\nthat morning for the first time and that he had come from a country<br />\nmuch farther off than was the State of Vermont. In the light of subsequent experience I should have known that my conclusion was not<br />\nwarranted by the testimony.<br />\n\"After some digital irritation of his scalp, Jim 'reckoned that<br />\nthe University was up on Howard street, just beyond the Academy.'<br />\n<br />\ndiet, gave up wearing woolen next the skin, and took to bathing every<br />\nday.<br />\n\"The ideal, of course, is intellectual giants in surroundings a propriate to their stature.

And I myself,<br />\nlike the majority of my kind before and since, had come to Johns Hopkins not because it was Johns Hopkins, but because it possessed one<br />\nparticular scholar of 'world wide reputation under whom I wished to<br />\nstudy. Buildings to me were of secondary importance. And, as I<br />\nhad just learned, it was well that they were so.

Under Professor Elliott's policy of allowing every instructor to have some graduate<br />\nteaching to encourage research, he<br />\nwas early given the work of teaching a graduate course in French<br />\nliterature, which he has continued<br />\nuntil the present.<br />\nDuring the last two years he<br />\nhas been senior instructor in the<br />\nFrench Department and executive<br />\nof the Department of Romance<br />\nLanguages. He was elected to the<br />\n\u2022deanship to take the place of the<br />\nlate Dean Griffen.

Prof. Grandville Reynard Jones, of the civil<br />\nengineering faculty, died on December 22, 1918.<br />\nEarly in November, Professor<br />\nJones was commissioned a captain<br />\nin the Sanitary Corps of the Surgeon General's Department of the<br />\narmy. He was ordered to Camp<br />\nGreenleaf in Georgia for a brief<br />\nperiod of training, at the end of<br />\nwhich time he was sent to Camp<br />\nBenning at Columbus, Ga., as the<br />\ncamp sanitary engineer. There he<br />\ncontracted influenza in a particularly virulent form, which developed into bronchial pneumonia,<br />\nfrom which he died. As the armistice had been signed subsequent to his acceptance of a commission, he was momentarily expecting his discharge, but was<br />\nstill in active service at the time<br />\nof his death.<br />\nProfessor Jones graduated from<br />\nOhio State University in 1904 and<br />\nfrom the Massachusetts Institute<br />\n'of Technology (sanitary engineering) in 1907. His principal professional work was with the filtration plant in Washington, D. C.,<br />\nwhere he held a responsible executive position.<br />\nIn his work at the Johns Hopkins University, Professor Jones<br />\nhas been particularly successful.<br />\nHe largely designed and built the<br />\nhydraulic laboratory and the laboratory of sanitary research. He<br />\nhad the rare combination of practical experience in engineering<br />\nand deep interest in scientific investigation. He was an able teacher, and had developed several<br />\ncourses in sanitary engineering<br />\nfor the Senior classes in civil engineering.<br />\nProfessor Jones married Miss<br />\nGertrude Mann, of Milford, Mass.,<br />\nwho, with three children, survives<br />\nhim.<br /><br />\nThe Adams contest in debating<br />\nbetween the Senior and Junior<br />\nclasses, which will be held on the<br />\nevening of February 21, in the lecture hall of the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding, will open a very active<br />\ndebating season. Plans for the<br />\nseason are in process of formulation under the guidance of the<br />\nDebating Council. The continuance of the old triangle with University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina is being<br />\nconsidered, but several challenges<br />\nfrom other colleges have been received. In case either of the old<br />\nmembers of the triangle withdraw,<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania or<br />\nWashington and Lee may be substituted.<br />\nFor the Adams contest on February 21, the prize of books left by<br />\nProf. Herbert Baxter Adams will<br />\nbe awarded as usual to the winning team. Try-outs for the determination of the makeup of the<br />\nteams resulted for the Seniors in<br />\nthe choosing of R. Thomsen, M.<br />\nGuttmacher, L. Simon and M. Novey. Bartels and Lewin will form<br />\nthe nucleus of the Junior team<br />\nand the other members will be<br />\nchosen in the near future.<br />\nThe controversy will be: \"Resolved, that the railroads of the<br />\nUnited States should be owned<br />\nand operated by the Government.\"<br />\nIt is a question of present day interest, and it is thought by the<br />\ncommittee in charge that there<br />\nwill be a large audience to hear<br />\nthe debaters.<br />\nLouis B.

A. T. C. and those who have<br />\nreturned from the army concerning the conversion of the Government insurance into some other<br />\nform. Many have been undecided<br />\nwhether to retain the insurance,<br />\nor let it lapse. The latter course,<br />\nunless positively necessary, would<br />\nbe most unwise. The Government<br />\nhas adopted a plan of carrying the<br />\nconverted policies, instead of having them taken over within a period of five years by private companies.<br />\nThrough this plan, the policyholders will share in dividends,<br />\nand all profits of over 3/<br />\n1<br />\n2 per<br />\ncent, will go into dividends. The<br />\nreserves will be invested in Government securities, which usually<br />\nbear 41/2 per cent.; hence, it is<br />\nthought that our former soldiers<br />\nwill periodically be recipients of<br />\nreasonably large dividends. Moreover, the premiums, which will<br />\nsoon be collected through postmasters in each community, will<br />\nbe far lower than any private concern could offer. Keep your insurance for the full amount, then,<br />\nand as soon as the rates are announced, choose one of the six<br />\nforms of insurance offered. Too<br />\ngood an opportunity is being given<br />\nthe boys who have served to be<br />\nthrown away.<br /><br />\nA University Loss.<br />\nNearly two months ago, the<br />\nsudden death of one of Hopkins'<br />\nmost distinguished and loyal men,<br />\nProf. Kirby Flower Smith, cast a<br />\npall over the whole University. It<br />\nis not for us to supplement the eloquent tributes, which were then<br />\npaid him. They were many, for<br />\nhe was as universally loved, as he<br />\nwas widely known. He was an<br />\neminent scholar and a true Hopkins product of the old school, having been one of the University's<br />\nearly graduate students, after receiving his degree from the UniverShall We Give Support?<br />\nsity of Vermont. He held many<br />\nNow<br />\nthat the war clouds hover<br />\npositions of honor and trust,<br />\namong them Director of the Amer- no more about us, and the elusive<br />\nican College for Classical Studies dove has again been captured, a<br /><br />\nmore or less natural, but exaggerated, antipathy to matters 'military arises within us. The reflex<br />\naction of the war is the cause of<br />\nthe apathetic state of the Hopkins mind in regard to any form<br />\nof training in arms, but this condition will, in all probability be<br />\nshort-lived.<br />\nWe should face the issue squarely. Why is the Government adding to its already colossal expenses by establishing even more<br />\nR. 0. T. C. units than it maintained last year? It is clear that<br />\nreadiness for emergencies in this<br />\nchaotic state of the world will be<br />\ninsured, and the Government looks<br />\nto the college men for officer material. Surely, if any plan of universal training should be adopted,<br />\nthe R. 0. T. C. is a most palatable<br />\nform.<br />\nThe R. 0. T. C. now in consideration will be totally different from<br />\nthe S. A. T. C., which left many<br />\nwith a distaste for the military<br />\nart, for now the requisite few<br />\nhours will be devoted only to an<br />\ninteresting presentation of the<br />\nknowledge an officer should have.<br />\nPractically all the routine, monotonous features have been eliminated. The present R. 0. T. C.<br />\nwill, moreover, be a far cry from<br />\nits namesake during the S. A. T.<br />\nC.,-when the red, white and blue<br />\ncord was worn only by those too<br />\nyoung or physically incapacitated<br />\nfor S. A. T. C. service.<br />\nA unit is to be established at<br />\nHopkins,whether the student body<br />\nmake it second to none in the<br />\ncountry, as was the case last year,<br />\nor whether they choose to make<br />\nit mediocre. Certainly, we have<br />\nevery facility for duplicating last<br />\nyear's performance.<br />\nCaptain Guild, the district inspector over thirty-six colleges,<br />\nhas given up his position to return<br />\nto Hopkins. There is no more<br />\ncapable man for this type of work<br />\nin the country, and, with student<br />\nsupport, he will again make Hopkins head the list. Those who<br />\nwere at Plattsburg know Hopkins'<br />\nreputation among the other universities; and the esteem with<br />\nwhich Captain Guild was regarded at the camp. The Harvard men<br />\nthere boasted that this year their<br />\nunit would surpass that of Hopkins, and even now they are laying foundations for the attempt.<br />\nWe have a debt to pay the man<br />\nwho made our name the by-word<br />\nfor efficiency.<br />\nThe University authorities, furthermore, are in hearty co-opera-<br /><br />\nFOUR CLASSES ELECT OFFICERS<br />\nAfter S.

When he entered the Johns Hopkins Graduate Department,<br />\nthe University was but ten years old. Professor Smith's account gives us a<br />\nstriking picture of the down-town buildings and some of the \"old school\" men:<br /><br />\n\"It was nearly midnight when I reached Baltimore and had established myself at the Eutaw House. The next morning I approached<br />\nthe desk_ and modestly inquired of the clerk the whereabouts of Johns<br />\nHopkins University. He seemed to me a stern and haughty man. And<br />\nhis only reply to my question was,'Oh, Jim!' For the moment I was<br />\nboth startled and bewildered. It was the first time I had ever heard<br />\nthis local use of 'Oh' with the vocative, and I feared that he was either<br />\nangry or in pain. I partially realized my mistake as soon as a young<br />\nnegro rose up from one of those long settees which every American<br />\nhotel keeps for the use of bellboys, and strolled casually over to the<br />\ndesk. 'Jim,' repeated the haughty one, 'where's the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity?' His rendition of the name as well as the question itself<br />\nat once suggested to me that he too must have appeared in Baltimore<br />\nthat morning for the first time and that he had come from a country<br />\nmuch farther off than was the State of Vermont. In the light of subsequent experience I should have known that my conclusion was not<br />\nwarranted by the testimony.<br />\n\"After some digital irritation of his scalp, Jim 'reckoned that<br />\nthe University was up on Howard street, just beyond the Academy.'<br /><br />\ndiet, gave up wearing woolen next the skin, and took to bathing every<br />\nday.<br />\n\"The ideal, of course, is intellectual giants in surroundings a propriate to their stature.

And I myself,<br />\nlike the majority of my kind before and since, had come to Johns Hopkins not because it was Johns Hopkins, but because it possessed one<br />\nparticular scholar of 'world wide reputation under whom I wished to<br />\nstudy. Buildings to me were of secondary importance. And, as I<br />\nhad just learned, it was well that they were so.

Heb Evans, first<br />\nsubstitute catcher, will be on hand<br />\nwhen practice opens, trying to win<br />\nthe position of first-string catcher,<br />\n\u2022 while Elmer Jones has announced<br />\nhis candidacy for the team in some<br />\nposition, either behind the bat, on<br />\nfirst, in the field, in the pitcher's<br />\nbox, or even umpire.
