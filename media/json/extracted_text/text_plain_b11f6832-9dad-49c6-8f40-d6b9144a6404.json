Originally established by a joint Hopkins-Navy<br />\nFEATURE<br />\neffort, the laboratory provided a<br />\nnecessary research base during the<br />\nsecond world war. Hopkins undertook the connection with the military during wartime as a patriotic<br />\nsupport of the war effort by carrying out research that had to be<br />\ndone. The connection with the Applied Physics Lab has outlived this<br />\noriginal wartime need. \"It is now,\" said Professor G.E. Owen,<br />\nChairman of the Hopkins Physics Department, \"a traditional<br />\nobligation which the University must fulfill.\"<br />\nIn 1942, the Radiation Laboratory was founded as yet another<br />\nmeans of acquiring information<br />\nvital to the war effort. It was not<br />\nat that time an integral part of the<br />\nUniversity, but its links with the<br />\nuniversity were strong. This connection eventually produced, in<br />\n1956, the radiation laboratory as<br />\nan integral part of the Electrical<br />\nBy DAVID HOELSCHER<br />\nEngineering Department, though<br />\nCitizens and Scientists for<br />\nstill off campus. It was not until McCarthy,<br />\nan<br />\norganization<br />\n1962 that it moved on to campus composed<br />\nof<br />\ndoctors,<br />\nand became the Carlyle Barton businessmen and professors who<br />\nLaboratories.<br />\nworked for McCarthy during his<br />\nfor<br />\nthe<br />\nDemocratic<br />\nThe Ballistics Analysis bid<br />\nnomination,<br />\nhas<br />\nrecently split<br />\nLaboratory is an off-campus<br />\nHopkins-military research over the question of support for<br />\nestablishment that was never Vice-President Humphrey.<br />\nDespite their apparent division<br />\nelevated to a position within the<br />\nover<br />\nthe candidacy of the<br />\nUniversity structure. Initially, its<br />\npurpose was to study basic Vice-President, however, both<br />\npenetration effects of crystal sections of the Citizens and<br />\nstructure utilizing mathematical Scientists for McCarthy feel that<br />\nmodels. Over the years, however, if their activity is to have any<br />\nit has moved away from this area influence after the elections, the<br />\ninto the field of more practical, group must remain within the<br />\napplied research. Because of this, Democratic Party.<br />\nMr. Larry Kamanity, one of<br />\nand because, as stated by the<br />\nDean of the faculty of Arts and those who are against giving active<br />\nSciences, Allyn Kimball, \"it no support to Humphrey, stated that,<br />\nlonger is doing any research or despite present organizational<br />\nwork in which any member of the difficulties, \"the major purpose of<br />\nfaculty of this university is the group is unity.\"<br />\nInter-Election Lobbying<br />\ninterested,\" the university is<br />\nplanning on severing its ties with<br />\nThe<br />\nform<br />\nwhich<br />\nsuch<br />\nthe laboratory by the end of participation will take does differ<br />\n1968.<br />\nbetween the two groups, however.<br />\nDr. Herbert Dickerman, Chairman<br />\n<br />\nBy RANDY PASTERNAK<br />\nThe controversial Black<br />\nStudent Union suffered a setback<br />\nlast Monday night when its<br />\nproposed constitution failed to<br />\nobtain the necessary two-thirds<br />\nvote required for ratification by<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nThe vote followed a session<br />\nmarked by extensive debate<br />\nconcerning the goals laid out by<br />\nthe Black Student Union.<br />\nHowever, the greatest discussion<br />\ncentered around Article IV of the<br />\nproposed document. This article<br />\ndeclared membership open \"to all<br />\nblack students,\" a phrase which<br />\nmany members of the Council<br />\ninterpreted as discriminatory.<br />\nJohn Guess, a Council<br />\nrepresentative and member of the<br />\nBSU, brought the measure to the<br />\nCouncil's attention after the<br />\nmotion had been tabled at last<br />\nweek's meeting. Bruce Baker,<br />\nPresident of the BSU, was also<br />\npresent at the session to defend<br />\nthe constitution.<br />\nAccording to Baker and Guess,<br />\nthe Union would serve two<br />\nessential purposes on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. The first one would be to<br />\nattract black students to apply<br />\nhere, and the second to aid these<br />\nstudents in orienting themselves<br />\nto an all-white situation while<br />\nmaintaining their black identity.<br />\nBaker stated that black<br />\nstudents were having trouble<br />\ngetting Negroes to apply here<br />\nbecause of the Hopkins image as a<br />\nsegregated school. This situation is<br />\nfurther aggravated, Baker and<br />\nGuess asserted, by the fact that<br />\nNegro students here were<br />\n\"plopped into a white world\"<br />\nwhere the university funnels them<br />\nto the various areas of the<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nTherefore, it was felt that in<br />\norder to make students feel that<br />\nthere \"is something in being black<br />\nat Hopkins,\" the BSU must be the<br />\nagency through which the<br />\nrecruitment and activities of black<br />\n<br />\nGroup Splits Over<br />\nHumphrey Support<br />\nof the Democratic Caucus which<br />\nis composed of the pro-Humphrey<br />\nmembers, indicated that he<br />\nbelieves the only way to influence<br />\nparty politics in America today is<br />\nto present the Democratic Party<br />\nwith a firm Democratic-liberal<br />\nconstituency.<br />\n\"A good deal of politics is<br />\nlobbying,\"<br />\ninter-election<br />\nhe<br />\ncontinued, \"and to be effective<br />\nthere must be intra-party lobbying<br />\nwith visible support to back us<br />\nup.\"<br />\nDr. Dickerman continued by<br />\nsaying that his decision to support<br />\nthe Vice-President was, among<br />\nother factors, \"both tactical and<br />\nstrategic.\"<br />\nSupport For Humphrey<br />\nHowever, Dickerman outlined<br />\nthree major considerations which<br />\ninfluenced the decision of the<br />\nDemocratic Caucus to support<br />\nHumphrey.<br />\nFirst, he cited the drastic<br />\nrightest reactionary movement as<br />\nindicative of the post-Democratic<br />\nConvention period. \"Should the<br />\n(Continued on Page 6)<br />\n<br />\nstudents on campus are governed.<br />\nNo Precedents<br />\nAccording to Russ Passarella,<br />\nPresident of the Student Council,<br />\nratification of an organization's<br />\nconstitution by the Student<br />\nCouncil entitles them to bear the<br />\nname of the school in their title,<br />\naccess to university funds, and<br />\nfree use of the Homewood<br />\nfacilities. However, adoption of<br />\nthis measure was complicated by<br />\nthe fact that few, if any,<br />\nprecedents had been established<br />\non which to judge the various<br />\naspects of the proposal.<br />\nDebate on the intended goals<br />\nofthe BSU was limited, because<br />\nthe Council members all agreed on<br />\nthe basic goals of the organization<br />\nand their value to Hopkins.<br />\nHowever, there was heated<br />\ndiscussion about the fourth<br />\narticle, the eligibility clause. The<br />\nrepresentatives of the Black<br />\nStudents Union attempted to<br />\nestablish precedent for the<br />\nexclusionary clause. They claimed<br />\nthat this was an example of the<br />\nCouncil's approving the<br />\nestablishment of a denominational<br />\nagency, which has a restrictive<br />\nmembership policy. But after<br />\ninquiries as to the guidelines<br />\nregarding adoption of an<br />\norganizations charter, Russ<br />\nPassarella replied that no exact<br />\nguidelines did exist at all.<br />\nTherefore, the JSA could not be<br />\nused as a base from which to<br />\nwork.<br />\nToo Many Whites<br />\nThe principal defense put forth<br />\nby Baker and Guess was the fear<br />\nthat open membership would<br />\ndilute the BSU with a large<br />\nnumber of white students.<br />\nIn a school where the black<br />\nstudents account for only one per<br />\ncent of the general student body,<br />\nthe spokesmen for the BSU<br />\nsuggested that it would be easily<br />\npossible for a white membership<br />\nto exert the dominant influence.<br />\nA membership thus composed<br />\nwould only serve to perpetuate<br />\nthe Hopkins image as a \"lily<br />\nwhite\" school.<br />\nUncle Tom Image<br />\nJohn Guess said that the<br />\ndestiny ofthe black students must<br />\nbe in their own hands. The<br />\nprimary problem was to avoid the<br />\nUncle Tom image, which would<br />\nbe fatal to the successful<br />\noperation of the Black Student<br />\nUnion. Baker added that the<br />\ndefinite purpose of the Union<br />\nwould be a true integration of the<br />\nblack student into the school, not<br />\nhis segregation from the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nMost members of the Council,<br />\nthough, were still unconvinced<br />\nabout the wisdom of the<br />\n(Continued on Page 3)<br />\n<br />\nSeammon to Speak<br />\nRichard Scammon, former<br />\ndirector of the Census and adviser<br />\nto Presidents Kennedy and<br />\nJohnson, will be addressing the<br />\nUniversity at 4:00 p.m. today on<br />\nthe topic of \"Polls and Politics\".<br />\nOn Sunday, David Brinkley, noted<br />\nNBC reporter, will speak,<br />\npresenting \"A Report From<br />\nWashington.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD,I3ALTIMORE,OCTOBER 25, 1968<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nS.D.S.

To<br />\nsubstantiate this assertion, he<br />\nemployed what he termed the<br />\nprecedent of racism on the<br />\nHomewood campus.

For all intents and purposes, we<br />\ncould have written this editorial last week. Council members,judging<br />\nby the past meeting, have exceptional skill in parliamentary procedure, analysis of \"precedents\" and the general, empty game of<br />\n\"student government.\" However, they have confirmed their inability<br />\nto address substantive issues as well as their lack of foresight.<br />\nForget, for one moment, the \"Games Student Legislators Play.\"<br />\nInstead, let us consider the value of a Black Student Union at Hopkins<br />\nand the reasons why such an organization merits University support - support which they\u2022 seemed to have from Univeristy officals when<br />\nthey organized last spring.<br />\nThe Hopkins Admissions office continually bewails its inability<br />\nto attract black students to Hopkins. The reason is obvious - - in a<br />\nsemi-Southern City and in a predominantly white university, the<br />\nprospective black student must feel that he is entering an alien<br />\nsituation The Black Student Union, as an officially recognized and<br />\nsupported organization, could have made giant strides in letting<br />\nprospective black students know that they would have somewhere to<br />\nturn once they arrived at Homewood - - in the same way that some<br />\nJewish students turn to the J.S.A., in the same way that middle-class<br />\nwhites invariably make most of their acquaintances with people from<br />\nthe same background.<br />\nThe Black Student Union also could have opened avenues of<br />\ncommunication with the official university, letting administrators and<br />\nacademic deans know about reforms or programs which would be<br />\nrelevant to the black students as well as their white counterparts.<br />\nMembers of theSouncil, and others who were present at the<br />\nmeeting, seemed to unanimously applaud the goals of the Black<br />\nStudent Union, particularly in relation to BSU help in recruiting black<br />\nstudents.<br />\nObviously, the Council would like to see the BSU continue in<br />\nthese efforts. We feel that this is somewhat akin to the Council having<br />\nits proverbial cake and eating it too. Though we reject any implication<br />\nthat the SC was bigoted or \"racist\" in its decision, we would suggest<br />\nthat this attitude, as innocent as it may be, points up the reason for<br />\nblack resentment against whites in America today.<br />\nOther colleges and universities have debated the same \"discriminatory\" membership clause in black student group charters.Overwhelmingly, they have decided that the special nature and purpose of<br />\nblack student groups overrides the importance of parliamentary<br />\nhaggling. Notably, the University of Pennsylvania student government<br />\ntackled the same question and decided not only to grant a charter to<br />\nthe U. of P. black students, but to fund them with $2,100. Even<br />\nGoucher has approved the charter of their black students' group.<br />\nIn the past, we have urged the Student Council to deal with<br />\nrelevant, weighty issues instead of traditional trivia. We retract that<br />\nsuggestion. We do not feel the Council is capable of dealing with such<br />\nissues. If one checks the recent history of the Council, this will be<br />\nborne out. After \"urging\" from the News-Letter, the Council<br />\nundertook the writing of a Student Bill of Rights (suggested by the<br />\nNews-Letter) which failed; it also sought to establish the Free<br />\nUniversity, (also suggested at a Council meeting by the News-Letter)<br />\nwhich has been one of their few substantial successes.<br />\nIf it were not for the question of funds, we would have advised<br />\nthe Black Student Union to completely ignore the Student Council<br />\nand to operate independently, which it appears it will now do<br />\nanyway. We would recommend this approach to students in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\n<br />\nSergio et. at.<br />\nSpeaking of the Student Council, their choice of entertainment for the \"big weekend\" comes to mind. In their search for a<br />\n\"big name,\" they managed to land Sergio Mendes to contribute to<br />\nthe pleasure of all.<br />\nNow, just who made the decision and why the hell did they<br />\npick Sergio Mendes? If they wanted a big name, we are sure that<br />\nLawrence Welk is equally available.<br />\nSomehow, we can conjure up in our minds a picture of the<br />\n\"big night,\" with all the members of the Student Council listening<br />\nwith rapt attention to the strains of updated bossa nova. They<br />\nshould have plenty of seats to drape their legs over.<br />\n<br />\n\"BELLY\" FANS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI should like very briefly to<br />\nsound a note of approbation for<br />\nMr. Art Levine, who was so<br />\nbelabored by two of your more<br />\nhysterical readers in the October<br />\n18th issue of the News-Letter<br />\nMr. Levine's piece on George<br />\nWallace was undoubtedly<br />\noverwritten in places, but I think<br />\nit succeeded admirably in<br />\nrecreating for his readers what was<br />\napparently the mood, or to be<br />\nmore precise, the tone of the<br />\nWallace rally. Certainly one<br />\ncannot blame Mr. Levine for<br />\nreacting so strongly to that<br />\nsegment of the political spectrum<br />\nwhich today most endangers our<br />\nfreedom, both personal and<br />\nnational. Also, it must be<br />\nremembered that Mr. Levin's<br />\narticle was not a news story; he<br />\nwas merely writing, and quite<br />\neffectively for the most part, of<br />\nhis own understandable responses<br />\nto organized fascism.<br />\nI would only add that I think<br />\nMr. Levine's writing style is<br />\ninfinitely superior to those of his<br />\ncritics, who attack him primarily<br />\non stylistic grounds.<br />\nJohn Halperin.<br />\n<br />\nMORE ON BELLY<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nApologizing to Mr. Levine in<br />\nadvance for any interpretational<br />\ninjustices I may do him, I would<br />\nlike to bring several points to the<br />\ndubious attention of Messrs.<br />\nMcDonough and Bodnar:<br />\n1. Elegy to a Belly was a<br />\nfeature story; there is no reason<br />\nfor it to have been unbiased.<br />\n2. There is no law of<br />\njournalism, or any other subject,<br />\nthat says that only concise writing<br />\ncan possibly be true. (I feel<br />\ncompelled to add that \"a<br />\nsquidlike ink of\" sounds rather<br />\nundisciplined itself to me.)<br />\n3. The story, gentlemen, is (are<br />\nyou ready) a SATIRE. He's<br />\nputting you on. Exaggerating. Dig<br />\nit?<br />\n4. The commie-nigger-faggot\u2014<br />\nkike conspiracy includes you, Mr.<br />\nMcDonough, despite that<br />\nwholesome name. If the CNFK<br />\netc. conspiracy is finally wiped<br />\nout, by good old George, or the<br />\npeople that have given their hearts<br />\nto him, you go too. I anticipate<br />\nyour incredulity (\"who, me?\"),<br />\nand I advise you to spend enough<br />\ntime talking to Wallace supporters<br />\nto find out what they think of<br />\nthose goddamn college kids. (I<br />\nhave, and if Wallace is elected, I'm<br />\ngone for Gait's Gulch.)<br />\nI would also like to say<br />\n(although it has no possible<br />\nbearing on the verity of the story,<br />\nyou know) that I thought that<br />\nElegy was beautifully written, and<br />\neminently efficacious.<br />\nStephen Tulloss<br />\n<br />\nbalance. I think you and your<br />\nstaff have done a very fine job in<br />\ndiscussing the issues which face<br />\nyour generation, and I would urge<br />\nyou to give deep thought in your<br />\ndiscussions.<br />\nI am disturbed, however, by<br />\nthe tasteless co:Aments of Art<br />\nLevine in His \"Elegy of a Belly.\"<br />\nFour letter Anglo-Saxon words<br />\nare not unknown to most of us,<br />\nbut we do not have to dignify<br />\ntheir use by publishing in a<br />\nquality paper such as the<br />\nNews-Letter. I have used the<br />\nNews-Letter in discussions with<br />\nmy young sons and with my<br />\nfriends. I have not been ashamed<br />\nthat it would be a gutter level<br />\ndialogue. Levine's article easily<br />\nreaches this level. The article itself<br />\nbetrays his extreme bias and his<br />\nutter lack of reportorial skill. I<br />\ndon't object to his position<br />\nespecially with the byline, and I<br />\nthink it could be a pleasant<br />\nexperience viewing the Wallace<br />\nrally through Levine's eyes. What<br />\nI object to is the poor taste and<br />\nuse of gutter level words in a<br />\npublication which deserves better.<br />\nW.R. McCartin<br />\nPhoenix, Maryland<br />\nMENDELSOHN IDOLIZED<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI just read Ed Mendelsohn's<br />\narticle about the ethnic<br />\nimplications of campaign '68. The<br />\npiece was well-written and totally<br />\n\"Ed Mendelsohn.\" He is a walking<br />\nprimary source, trivia expert in<br />\nthe history field. I thought I'd<br />\nacknowledge a fellow neighbor<br />\nfrom Far Rockaway and Hopkins.<br />\nHe did a great job. Don't lose him<br />\nfrom your staff - - he just might<br />\n\"make\" the News-Letter.<br />\n-Linda Wertheim<br />\nGoucher '71<br />\n<br />\nOn ROTC<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have always been very proud<br />\nthat Hopkins has had a paper that<br />\nhas not limited itself to merely<br />\nsupplying the academic<br />\ncommunity with news of campus<br />\nactivities but rather has seen fit to<br />\npresent a vigorous editorial as well<br />\nas news coverage of any matter<br />\nthat the staff feels affects the<br />\nstudent body. Everyone has<br />\nalways known where the<br />\nNews-Letter really stood on the<br />\nimportant issues of the day.<br />\nHowever, please allow me to<br />\ntake issue with your recently<br />\nexpressed opinions vis a vis<br />\nHopkins ROTC. As a member of<br />\nthe JHU Battallion for 4 years, let<br />\nme assure you that training<br />\n\"killers\" is not the primary goal<br />\nof the program. Rather, I believe<br />\nthat the goal is one of training<br />\ncollege educated men to assume<br />\npositions of leadership in the<br />\narmed forces.<br />\nI am not attempting to insist<br />\nthat eithei was or the Army or<br />\neven ROTC is \"right.\" Rather, I<br />\nbelieve that Hopkins men have a<br />\nEVEN MORE...<br />\n\"right\" to take ROTC, if they so<br />\nwish, just as they may take any<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nother<br />\ncourse that the University<br />\nAs a former student and writer<br />\nfor the News-Letter, I have may wish to offer and that they<br />\nfollowed the publication with are qualified to take. It seems<br />\ngreat interest. I have been difficult to believe that apostles of<br />\nimpressed by the maturing individual freedom (and I know<br />\nstudents' growing awareness of that the News-Letter is among<br />\nthe more significant and those apostles) would deny<br />\nimportant elements which are students the right to take a course<br />\nvital to the existence of our they desire to take in preparing<br />\nsociety. Despite my liberalism, I for their future lives.<br />\nHarold W. Geisel<br />\nhave not always been pleased with<br />\nHopkins '68<br />\nthe emotionalism and extremism<br />\nwhich are generated in lieu of<br />\nBAD WRITER S.<br />\nserious thought. But I am To the Editors:<br />\nconfident that sheer age will be a<br />\nIn the introductory paragraph<br />\nmajor factor in redressing the of \"The Ballad of<br />\nthe Good<br />\n<br />\nSoldier S.,\" one receives the<br />\ndistinct impression that Mr.<br />\nSakowich sets out to tell a story,<br />\nan impression which remains as<br />\nlong as no one reads past the<br />\nsecond sentence. \"The author is<br />\nmerely trying to tell a story in a<br />\nparticular style designed to best<br />\nobtain his ends.\" Now if telling a<br />\nstory is all that he countenances,<br />\nthen the last phrase is superfluous.<br />\nBut what we have here is not<br />\nsuperfluity (which the reader soon<br />\ndiscovers) but a hint that the<br />\nauthor wishes to proselytize<br />\nwithout fear of counter-argument.<br />\n(Ah, c'mon folks, I'm only telling<br />\na story.)<br />\nDespite S.'s totemic<br />\nindifference, an analysis of his<br />\nballad can do him nothing but<br />\ngood. The first sentence braces<br />\none for things to come. \"In a<br />\nsunny corner of Southeast<br />\nVirginia,\" (Get it, folks-what do<br />\nyou really expect after<br />\n\"Southeast\") \"Sok very excitedly<br />\nwatched a large Crusader Jet<br />\nfighter shaft the beach . .\"(Note<br />\nthe choice of adverb-everyone<br />\nrealizes that a display of emotion<br />\nover such a thing is a no-no.)<br />\nBut let's follow in Sak's<br />\nfootsteps and not get hung up<br />\nwith logic or analysis. He rambles<br />\non to a comparison of martial<br />\nmusic and hashish, in other words<br />\nbetween something which is<br />\nemotionally moving because of<br />\nwhat it symbolizes and a drug<br />\nwhich induces the physiological<br />\neffect of intoxication. That's a<br />\nreally cute analogy. Cute, but not<br />\ntoo bright.<br />\nBut he has not yet begun to<br />\nfight. He then proffers for the nth<br />\ntime the primary consideration of<br />\nanti-war liturgy - - Can you<br />\nactually kill a man \"who breathes,<br />\nsits on the pot, etc., etc. (Should<br />\nhe ever serve in combat, S. can<br />\nderive great satisfaction from the<br />\nfact that he need not fire on an<br />\napproaching enemy, and by so<br />\ndoing live, for an infinitesimal<br />\nspan of life, with a clear<br />\nconscience.

This would give<br />\nWallace 128 electoral votes,<br />\nleaving 410 electoral votes outside<br />\nthe South to be divided between<br />\nNixon and Humphrey. If either<br />\nmajor-party candidate carried 66<br />\nper cent of the electoral vote in<br />\nthese remaining non-southern<br />\nstates (270 electoral votes out of<br />\n410), then that major-party<br />\ncandidate would have a clear<br />\nelectoral college majority despite<br />\nWallace's exceptionally strong<br />\nshowing in the South.<br />\nAt lower levels of Wallace<br />\nelectoral college strength, an even<br />\nsmaller percentage of the<br />\nremaining electoral college vote<br />\nwould give one of the major-party<br />\ncandidates an electoral college<br />\nmajority.

FDR in 1944, with 53.5%<br />\nof the popular vote, got over 82%<br />\nof the electoral college vote. And<br />\nLyndon Johnson, in 1964, with<br />\n<br />\n%woe<br />\n<br />\nFAILURE<br />\n<br />\ntiso<br />\n<br />\nof the popular vote, receiy(,;(1<br />\nabout 90% of the electoral college<br />\nvote.<br />\nAs Professor Charles Bischcff<br />\nof Yale has demonstrated (1)y<br />\nanalyzing the relationship<br />\nbetween the popular vote and tl<br />\nelectoral college vote in the fo,.ur<br />\npresidential elections since 195 !),<br />\neven if Wallace carried all I,18<br />\nsouthern electoral votes, if Nix()0<br />\nor Humphrey had about a foUI<br />\npercentage point lead in tlhe<br />\nmajor-party vite in the remainiing<br />\n39 states(52.5% to 47.5%), Nix()n<br />\nor Humphrey would prolably<br />\nhave a clear majority in tlhe<br />\nelectoral college. If Wallace carn es<br />\nonly the five Deep South states, a<br />\ntwo per cent lead for one of the<br />\nmajor-party candidates in the<br />\npopular vote in the remaining'45<br />\nstates (51% to 49%) should giye<br />\nthe presidential candiate who is in<br />\nthe lead a clear electoral college<br />\nmajority. If only Alabama a]<br />\nMississippi go for Wallace, a one<br />\npercentage point popular vc te<br />\nlead in the remaining 48 sta1 es<br />\nwould probably produce a de ar<br />\nelectoral college majority.<br />\nAs this is written, virtually all<br />\nthe national polls give Nixon a<br />\nlarge lead over Humphrey (eiEht<br />\npercentage points or more) in the<br />\npopular vote. In the se<br />\ncircumstances, there seems to be<br />\nlittle chance of Nixon failing to<br />\nget an electoral college majority - no matter how many stal es<br />\nGeorge Wallace carries in the<br />\nSouth. If, however, the pi011<br />\nresults in early November shc<br />\nthat the popular vote gap between<br />\nthe two major-party candidal es<br />\nhas narrowed - - particularly if<br />\nthe gap is four per cent or smaller<br />\n- - then the possibility that the re<br />\nmay be no electoral colle Se<br />\nmajority cannot be ruled out(the<br />\nlatest Harris Poll has narrowed<br />\nNixon's lead to 5 percenta ge<br />\npoints).<br />\nLikely Outcome<br />\nWhat, then, would be the likely<br />\noutcome if the election were<br />\nthrown into the House?

At<br />\npresent, the Republicans control<br />\nonly 18 of the 50 state<br />\nuelegations - - and the votes of 26<br />\nstate delegations would be<br />\nrequired to elect the President in<br />\nthe House. Even if the party<br />\ncontrol were to change (as well<br />\nmight happen), the Republicans<br />\n'lave a long way to go to increase<br />\nthe number of delegations they<br />\ncontrol from 18 to 26.<br />\nOn the other hand, if the Deep<br />\nSouth nominally Democratic state<br />\ndelegations were to decide to<br />\nthrow their support to Nixon,<br />\nthen Nixon might have a chance<br />\nin the House. What one can be<br />\nsure of is that the pressures and<br />\nthe bargaining would be intense if<br />\nthe election were thrown in the<br />\nHouse.<br />\nMy own feeling is, however,<br />\nthat the election will not be<br />\nthrown into the House - - even if<br />\n00 presidential candidate gets a<br />\nclear electoral college majority. It<br />\nis more likely that if there is no<br />\nelectoral college majority, George<br />\nWallace would, after trying to<br />\nObtain whatever understandings it<br />\nWas possible for him to obtain,<br />\nthrow enough of his electoral<br />\ncollege support to one of the<br />\nMajor -party presidential<br />\ncandidates to elect Nixon or<br />\nHumphrey via the electoral<br />\ncollege route. He could, for<br />\nexample, hold a meeting of his<br />\nviz<br />\n<br />\nelectors in Montgomery, Alabama,<br />\nin late November, and there, in<br />\nfull view of the television cameras,<br />\nannounce that, in order to avert a<br />\nserious Constitutional crisis, he<br />\nhas instructed his electors to cast<br />\ntheir votes for Nixon, or for<br />\nHumphrey.<br />\nWallace Behavior<br />\nThere are several reasons why<br />\none might expect Wallace to<br />\nbehave in this fashion. First, as<br />\nHopkins' election expert Richard<br />\nM. Scammon has pointed out in a<br />\nrecent article in the Washington<br />\nPost, Wallace has a more direct<br />\npersonal control over the probabre<br />\nbehavior of his handpicked slates<br />\nof presidential electors than he<br />\ndoes over the Congressmen - even those from southern states - who sit in the House. The<br />\npresidential electors are his people<br />\nin a way that the Congressmen,<br />\nwith their own political base and<br />\ntheir own constituencies, are not.<br />\nWallace can be surer that ,the<br />\npresidential electors will do what<br />\nhe wants them to do than he can<br />\nthat the Congressmen will do as<br />\nhe wishes. Second, by behaving in<br />\nthis fashion, Wallace could help<br />\navert a serious constitutional<br />\ncrisis, and could get the credit for<br />\nthis from the American public. He<br />\ncould also thus be seen as a<br />\ndecisive factor in the electoral<br />\noutcome - - all of which would<br />\nleave him with a strong base for a<br />\nfuture try for the Presidency in<br />\n1972. By doing this, he would<br />\n<br />\nappear as a responsible leader who<br />\ngave the voters the opportunity to<br />\nregister their preferences, and<br />\nthen decided the final winner<br />\nwithin the normal framework of<br />\nthe Constitution.<br />\nFinally, there is still another<br />\nreason why it looks as though<br />\nWallace would not stand by and<br />\nwatch the final presidential choice<br />\nbe transferred to the House of<br />\nRepresentatives. Wallace, himself,<br />\nhas already tipped his hand as to<br />\nwhat he thinks would happen if<br />\nno one gets a majority in the<br />\nelectoral college.<br />\nWallace apparently first did<br />\nthis on the CBS-TV program<br />\n\"Face the Nation\" on July 21,<br />\n1968, where he said that the<br />\npresidential contest would be<br />\ndecided before the election was<br />\nthrown into the House. But on<br />\nSeptember 8, in an interview with<br />\neditors and writers of the Miami<br />\nHerald, he made the trend of his<br />\nthinking even clearer. Then he<br />\nsaid: \"I don't believe it is going to<br />\ngo to the House of<br />\nRepresentatives . . . the electoral<br />\ncollege meets first . . . I'd say the<br />\nelectoral college would settle the<br />\nPresidency before it gets to the<br />\nHouse.\"<br />\nBargaining<br />\nWhen asked if he expected<br />\n\"some bargaining\" in the electoral<br />\ncollege, Wallace replied, \"I don't<br />\nthink it will be a 'bargaining'<br />\nproposition. It will be a matter of<br />\nopen . . . covenants representing<br />\n<br />\nthe viewpoint of people. If I get as<br />\nmany votes - - popular votes - - as<br />\neither of the other candidates,<br />\nthen that group of people are<br />\nentitled to have some<br />\nrepresentation in the attitude of<br />\nthe new administration.\"<br />\nWhether it's called<br />\n\"bargaining\" or \"solemn<br />\nconvenants\" (the distinction is an<br />\nelusive one), it appears that<br />\nWallace Hopes to do some hard<br />\nbargaining with one of the major<br />\npresidential nominees in return<br />\nfor some or all of the electoral<br />\nvotes of Wallace presidential<br />\nelectors.

He realizes that lacrosse<br />\nhas the tradition here but that<br />\nfootball does not. The first-string<br />\nall-American attackman feels that<br />\nhis and Coach Sotir's primary goal<br />\nis creating a football tradition at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nJoe's sense of service is perhaps<br />\nthe strongest motivating factor in<br />\nhis life. When choosing between<br />\nHopkins and Navy he finally<br />\ndecided on Hopkins for two<br />\nreasons: the first because after his<br />\nfather died, he wanted to stay<br />\nnear home to be better able to<br />\nfulfill his family responsibilities<br />\nand the second, that he wanted to<br />\nplay big time lacrosse and<br />\nfootball. Cowan now feels that he<br />\nmight have considered Maryland<br />\nmore with hindsight because of<br />\ntheir courses in transportation<br />\nindustries (the family business is<br />\ntrucking) but that the general high<br />\nlevel of Hopkins courses would<br />\nprobably override that in the end<br />\nanyway.<br />\nKnocks Negative Protest<br />\nJoe also has his own ideas on<br />\nthe student protest movements.<br />\nHe began school less tolerant of<br />\nthe far left \u2014 disgusted with<br />\nshoulder length hair and the<br />\nwhole concept of negative protest<br />\n(with which he still disagrees).<br />\nBut, in his four years here, he has<br />\ngrown to recognize that these<br />\npeople, even if he cannot<br />\nunderstand them, have a right to<br />\ntheir beliefs. Cowan views the<br />\n<br />\nnational consciousness as being<br />\nseized by trends and what he feels<br />\nis prevelant now is the idea \"do<br />\nyour own thing.\"<br />\nHowever, Joseph is upset at.the<br />\nattitude, once so prevelent at<br />\nHopkins and which now lurks in<br />\nhe background, of unconcern for<br />\nfootball and religious attachment<br />\nto lacrosse \u2014 a type of hypocrisy<br />\nin Cowan's eyes. To Joe, this<br />\ndiscourages many fine athletes<br />\nfrom participating and he feels<br />\nthat this is a loss to the individual<br />\nand the school.<br />\nPro Potential<br />\nContemplating being drafted,<br />\nJoe emphasized that he would<br />\nonly play when he proved to<br />\nhimself that he had the ability. If<br />\nhe does not play pro ball, he plans<br />\nto work in his family trucking<br />\ncompany to do as much as<br />\npossible to help his family.<br />\nIf asked what Cowan's \"own<br />\nthing\" might be, I am sure that<br />\nthe average Hopkins sports fan<br />\nwould reply football or lacrosse_<br />\nHowever, I am not so sure he<br />\nwould be right. For Joe Cowan is<br />\na person who has attempted to<br />\nlive up to his responsibilities as he<br />\nhas seen them. He is a person who<br />\nhas thought deeply on what he<br />\nhas learned in his college career<br />\nand been mature enough to<br />\nchange his views when he felt<br />\nthem to be wrong.

Dr.<br />\nChissel, a private practitioner and<br />\na member of several state medical<br />\nadvisory committees, Mrs.<br />\nFlanagan and Mrs. MacDowell,<br />\nwhose families were cut from the<br />\nhealth care, Miss Thomas of the<br />\nHopkins Medical School, and<br />\nRepublican Senatorial Candidate<br />\nCharles Mathias.

Before July<br />\nher 10 children were able to go to<br />\nthe doctor, but now food and<br />\nclothing preempt their visits. Her<br />\nteenage daughter has one lung and<br />\n<br />\nmust have \u2022frequent treatments.<br />\nShe was going to the hospital<br />\nunder the Medicaid plan. \"But<br />\nnow when she asks me to take her<br />\nto the hospital, I have to lei' my<br />\nchild to wait 'til Friday when I get<br />\npaid.\"<br />\nCongressman Mathias followed<br />\nMrs. Flanagan and began by<br />\nrestating statistics on health care.<br />\n\"Fifteen million young Americans<br />\nhave \u2022received no medical care.<br />\nHalf of our children under 15<br />\nhave never seen a dentist office.\"<br />\nHowever, he seemed shakened by<br />\nMrs. Flanagan's plight, and told<br />\nthe audience, \"We in Washington<br />\nwill have to help.

Originally established by a joint Hopkins-Navy<br />\nFEATURE<br />\neffort, the laboratory provided a<br />\nnecessary research base during the<br />\nsecond world war. Hopkins undertook the connection with the military during wartime as a patriotic<br />\nsupport of the war effort by carrying out research that had to be<br />\ndone. The connection with the Applied Physics Lab has outlived this<br />\noriginal wartime need. \"It is now,\" said Professor G.E. Owen,<br />\nChairman of the Hopkins Physics Department, \"a traditional<br />\nobligation which the University must fulfill.\"<br />\nIn 1942, the Radiation Laboratory was founded as yet another<br />\nmeans of acquiring information<br />\nvital to the war effort. It was not<br />\nat that time an integral part of the<br />\nUniversity, but its links with the<br />\nuniversity were strong. This connection eventually produced, in<br />\n1956, the radiation laboratory as<br />\nan integral part of the Electrical<br />\nBy DAVID HOELSCHER<br />\nEngineering Department, though<br />\nCitizens and Scientists for<br />\nstill off campus. It was not until McCarthy,<br />\nan<br />\norganization<br />\n1962 that it moved on to campus composed<br />\nof<br />\ndoctors,<br />\nand became the Carlyle Barton businessmen and professors who<br />\nLaboratories.<br />\nworked for McCarthy during his<br />\nfor<br />\nthe<br />\nDemocratic<br />\nThe Ballistics Analysis bid<br />\nnomination,<br />\nhas<br />\nrecently split<br />\nLaboratory is an off-campus<br />\nHopkins-military research over the question of support for<br />\nestablishment that was never Vice-President Humphrey.<br />\nDespite their apparent division<br />\nelevated to a position within the<br />\nover<br />\nthe candidacy of the<br />\nUniversity structure.

Because of this, Democratic Party.<br />\nMr. Larry Kamanity, one of<br />\nand because, as stated by the<br />\nDean of the faculty of Arts and those who are against giving active<br />\nSciences, Allyn Kimball, \"it no support to Humphrey, stated that,<br />\nlonger is doing any research or despite present organizational<br />\nwork in which any member of the difficulties, \"the major purpose of<br />\nfaculty of this university is the group is unity.\"<br />\nInter-Election Lobbying<br />\ninterested,\" the university is<br />\nplanning on severing its ties with<br />\nThe<br />\nform<br />\nwhich<br />\nsuch<br />\nthe laboratory by the end of participation will take does differ<br />\n1968.<br />\nbetween the two groups, however.<br />\nDr. Herbert Dickerman, Chairman<br /><br />\nBy RANDY PASTERNAK<br />\nThe controversial Black<br />\nStudent Union suffered a setback<br />\nlast Monday night when its<br />\nproposed constitution failed to<br />\nobtain the necessary two-thirds<br />\nvote required for ratification by<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nThe vote followed a session<br />\nmarked by extensive debate<br />\nconcerning the goals laid out by<br />\nthe Black Student Union.<br />\nHowever, the greatest discussion<br />\ncentered around Article IV of the<br />\nproposed document. This article<br />\ndeclared membership open \"to all<br />\nblack students,\" a phrase which<br />\nmany members of the Council<br />\ninterpreted as discriminatory.<br />\nJohn Guess, a Council<br />\nrepresentative and member of the<br />\nBSU, brought the measure to the<br />\nCouncil's attention after the<br />\nmotion had been tabled at last<br />\nweek's meeting. Bruce Baker,<br />\nPresident of the BSU, was also<br />\npresent at the session to defend<br />\nthe constitution.<br />\nAccording to Baker and Guess,<br />\nthe Union would serve two<br />\nessential purposes on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. The first one would be to<br />\nattract black students to apply<br />\nhere, and the second to aid these<br />\nstudents in orienting themselves<br />\nto an all-white situation while<br />\nmaintaining their black identity.<br />\nBaker stated that black<br />\nstudents were having trouble<br />\ngetting Negroes to apply here<br />\nbecause of the Hopkins image as a<br />\nsegregated school. This situation is<br />\nfurther aggravated, Baker and<br />\nGuess asserted, by the fact that<br />\nNegro students here were<br />\n\"plopped into a white world\"<br />\nwhere the university funnels them<br />\nto the various areas of the<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nTherefore, it was felt that in<br />\norder to make students feel that<br />\nthere \"is something in being black<br />\nat Hopkins,\" the BSU must be the<br />\nagency through which the<br />\nrecruitment and activities of black<br /><br />\nGroup Splits Over<br />\nHumphrey Support<br />\nof the Democratic Caucus which<br />\nis composed of the pro-Humphrey<br />\nmembers, indicated that he<br />\nbelieves the only way to influence<br />\nparty politics in America today is<br />\nto present the Democratic Party<br />\nwith a firm Democratic-liberal<br />\nconstituency.<br />\n\"A good deal of politics is<br />\nlobbying,\"<br />\ninter-election<br />\nhe<br />\ncontinued, \"and to be effective<br />\nthere must be intra-party lobbying<br />\nwith visible support to back us<br />\nup.\"<br />\nDr. Dickerman continued by<br />\nsaying that his decision to support<br />\nthe Vice-President was, among<br />\nother factors, \"both tactical and<br />\nstrategic.\"<br />\nSupport For Humphrey<br />\nHowever, Dickerman outlined<br />\nthree major considerations which<br />\ninfluenced the decision of the<br />\nDemocratic Caucus to support<br />\nHumphrey.<br />\nFirst, he cited the drastic<br />\nrightest reactionary movement as<br />\nindicative of the post-Democratic<br />\nConvention period. \"Should the<br />\n(Continued on Page 6)<br /><br />\nstudents on campus are governed.<br />\nNo Precedents<br />\nAccording to Russ Passarella,<br />\nPresident of the Student Council,<br />\nratification of an organization's<br />\nconstitution by the Student<br />\nCouncil entitles them to bear the<br />\nname of the school in their title,<br />\naccess to university funds, and<br />\nfree use of the Homewood<br />\nfacilities. However, adoption of<br />\nthis measure was complicated by<br />\nthe fact that few, if any,<br />\nprecedents had been established<br />\non which to judge the various<br />\naspects of the proposal.<br />\nDebate on the intended goals<br />\nofthe BSU was limited, because<br />\nthe Council members all agreed on<br />\nthe basic goals of the organization<br />\nand their value to Hopkins.<br />\nHowever, there was heated<br />\ndiscussion about the fourth<br />\narticle, the eligibility clause. The<br />\nrepresentatives of the Black<br />\nStudents Union attempted to<br />\nestablish precedent for the<br />\nexclusionary clause. They claimed<br />\nthat this was an example of the<br />\nCouncil's approving the<br />\nestablishment of a denominational<br />\nagency, which has a restrictive<br />\nmembership policy. But after<br />\ninquiries as to the guidelines<br />\nregarding adoption of an<br />\norganizations charter, Russ<br />\nPassarella replied that no exact<br />\nguidelines did exist at all.<br />\nTherefore, the JSA could not be<br />\nused as a base from which to<br />\nwork.<br />\nToo Many Whites<br />\nThe principal defense put forth<br />\nby Baker and Guess was the fear<br />\nthat open membership would<br />\ndilute the BSU with a large<br />\nnumber of white students.<br />\nIn a school where the black<br />\nstudents account for only one per<br />\ncent of the general student body,<br />\nthe spokesmen for the BSU<br />\nsuggested that it would be easily<br />\npossible for a white membership<br />\nto exert the dominant influence.<br />\nA membership thus composed<br />\nwould only serve to perpetuate<br />\nthe Hopkins image as a \"lily<br />\nwhite\" school.<br />\nUncle Tom Image<br />\nJohn Guess said that the<br />\ndestiny ofthe black students must<br />\nbe in their own hands. The<br />\nprimary problem was to avoid the<br />\nUncle Tom image, which would<br />\nbe fatal to the successful<br />\noperation of the Black Student<br />\nUnion. Baker added that the<br />\ndefinite purpose of the Union<br />\nwould be a true integration of the<br />\nblack student into the school, not<br />\nhis segregation from the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nMost members of the Council,<br />\nthough, were still unconvinced<br />\nabout the wisdom of the<br />\n(Continued on Page 3)<br /><br />\nSeammon to Speak<br />\nRichard Scammon, former<br />\ndirector of the Census and adviser<br />\nto Presidents Kennedy and<br />\nJohnson, will be addressing the<br />\nUniversity at 4:00 p.m. today on<br />\nthe topic of \"Polls and Politics\".<br />\nOn Sunday, David Brinkley, noted<br />\nNBC reporter, will speak,<br />\npresenting \"A Report From<br />\nWashington.\"<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,I3ALTIMORE,OCTOBER 25, 1968<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nS.D.S.

To<br />\nsubstantiate this assertion, he<br />\nemployed what he termed the<br />\nprecedent of racism on the<br />\nHomewood campus. Cited as<br />\nexamples were the traditional<br />\ndiscriminatory practices of some<br />\nfraternities with respect to<br />\nNegroes and Jews. He added that<br />\nthese measures were not in the<br />\napproved constitutions of these<br />\norganizations, but existed just the<br />\nsame in various sectors of the<br />\nHopkins scene.

For all intents and purposes, we<br />\ncould have written this editorial last week. Council members,judging<br />\nby the past meeting, have exceptional skill in parliamentary procedure, analysis of \"precedents\" and the general, empty game of<br />\n\"student government.\" However, they have confirmed their inability<br />\nto address substantive issues as well as their lack of foresight.<br />\nForget, for one moment, the \"Games Student Legislators Play.\"<br />\nInstead, let us consider the value of a Black Student Union at Hopkins<br />\nand the reasons why such an organization merits University support - support which they\u2022 seemed to have from Univeristy officals when<br />\nthey organized last spring.<br />\nThe Hopkins Admissions office continually bewails its inability<br />\nto attract black students to Hopkins. The reason is obvious - - in a<br />\nsemi-Southern City and in a predominantly white university, the<br />\nprospective black student must feel that he is entering an alien<br />\nsituation The Black Student Union, as an officially recognized and<br />\nsupported organization, could have made giant strides in letting<br />\nprospective black students know that they would have somewhere to<br />\nturn once they arrived at Homewood - - in the same way that some<br />\nJewish students turn to the J.S.A., in the same way that middle-class<br />\nwhites invariably make most of their acquaintances with people from<br />\nthe same background.<br />\nThe Black Student Union also could have opened avenues of<br />\ncommunication with the official university, letting administrators and<br />\nacademic deans know about reforms or programs which would be<br />\nrelevant to the black students as well as their white counterparts.<br />\nMembers of theSouncil, and others who were present at the<br />\nmeeting, seemed to unanimously applaud the goals of the Black<br />\nStudent Union, particularly in relation to BSU help in recruiting black<br />\nstudents.<br />\nObviously, the Council would like to see the BSU continue in<br />\nthese efforts. We feel that this is somewhat akin to the Council having<br />\nits proverbial cake and eating it too. Though we reject any implication<br />\nthat the SC was bigoted or \"racist\" in its decision, we would suggest<br />\nthat this attitude, as innocent as it may be, points up the reason for<br />\nblack resentment against whites in America today.<br />\nOther colleges and universities have debated the same \"discriminatory\" membership clause in black student group charters.Overwhelmingly, they have decided that the special nature and purpose of<br />\nblack student groups overrides the importance of parliamentary<br />\nhaggling. Notably, the University of Pennsylvania student government<br />\ntackled the same question and decided not only to grant a charter to<br />\nthe U. of P. black students, but to fund them with $2,100. Even<br />\nGoucher has approved the charter of their black students' group.<br />\nIn the past, we have urged the Student Council to deal with<br />\nrelevant, weighty issues instead of traditional trivia. We retract that<br />\nsuggestion. We do not feel the Council is capable of dealing with such<br />\nissues. If one checks the recent history of the Council, this will be<br />\nborne out. After \"urging\" from the News-Letter, the Council<br />\nundertook the writing of a Student Bill of Rights (suggested by the<br />\nNews-Letter) which failed; it also sought to establish the Free<br />\nUniversity, (also suggested at a Council meeting by the News-Letter)<br />\nwhich has been one of their few substantial successes.<br />\nIf it were not for the question of funds, we would have advised<br />\nthe Black Student Union to completely ignore the Student Council<br />\nand to operate independently, which it appears it will now do<br />\nanyway. We would recommend this approach to students in the<br />\nfuture.<br /><br />\nSergio et. at.<br />\nSpeaking of the Student Council, their choice of entertainment for the \"big weekend\" comes to mind. In their search for a<br />\n\"big name,\" they managed to land Sergio Mendes to contribute to<br />\nthe pleasure of all.<br />\nNow, just who made the decision and why the hell did they<br />\npick Sergio Mendes? If they wanted a big name, we are sure that<br />\nLawrence Welk is equally available.<br />\nSomehow, we can conjure up in our minds a picture of the<br />\n\"big night,\" with all the members of the Student Council listening<br />\nwith rapt attention to the strains of updated bossa nova. They<br />\nshould have plenty of seats to drape their legs over.<br /><br />\n\"BELLY\" FANS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI should like very briefly to<br />\nsound a note of approbation for<br />\nMr. Art Levine, who was so<br />\nbelabored by two of your more<br />\nhysterical readers in the October<br />\n18th issue of the News-Letter<br />\nMr. Levine's piece on George<br />\nWallace was undoubtedly<br />\noverwritten in places, but I think<br />\nit succeeded admirably in<br />\nrecreating for his readers what was<br />\napparently the mood, or to be<br />\nmore precise, the tone of the<br />\nWallace rally. Certainly one<br />\ncannot blame Mr. Levine for<br />\nreacting so strongly to that<br />\nsegment of the political spectrum<br />\nwhich today most endangers our<br />\nfreedom, both personal and<br />\nnational. Also, it must be<br />\nremembered that Mr. Levin's<br />\narticle was not a news story; he<br />\nwas merely writing, and quite<br />\neffectively for the most part, of<br />\nhis own understandable responses<br />\nto organized fascism.<br />\nI would only add that I think<br />\nMr. Levine's writing style is<br />\ninfinitely superior to those of his<br />\ncritics, who attack him primarily<br />\non stylistic grounds.<br />\nJohn Halperin.<br /><br />\nMORE ON BELLY<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nApologizing to Mr. Levine in<br />\nadvance for any interpretational<br />\ninjustices I may do him, I would<br />\nlike to bring several points to the<br />\ndubious attention of Messrs.<br />\nMcDonough and Bodnar:<br />\n1. Elegy to a Belly was a<br />\nfeature story; there is no reason<br />\nfor it to have been unbiased.<br />\n2. There is no law of<br />\njournalism, or any other subject,<br />\nthat says that only concise writing<br />\ncan possibly be true. (I feel<br />\ncompelled to add that \"a<br />\nsquidlike ink of\" sounds rather<br />\nundisciplined itself to me.)<br />\n3. The story, gentlemen, is (are<br />\nyou ready) a SATIRE. He's<br />\nputting you on. Exaggerating. Dig<br />\nit?<br />\n4. The commie-nigger-faggot\u2014<br />\nkike conspiracy includes you, Mr.<br />\nMcDonough, despite that<br />\nwholesome name. If the CNFK<br />\netc. conspiracy is finally wiped<br />\nout, by good old George, or the<br />\npeople that have given their hearts<br />\nto him, you go too. I anticipate<br />\nyour incredulity (\"who, me?\"),<br />\nand I advise you to spend enough<br />\ntime talking to Wallace supporters<br />\nto find out what they think of<br />\nthose goddamn college kids. (I<br />\nhave, and if Wallace is elected, I'm<br />\ngone for Gait's Gulch.)<br />\nI would also like to say<br />\n(although it has no possible<br />\nbearing on the verity of the story,<br />\nyou know) that I thought that<br />\nElegy was beautifully written, and<br />\neminently efficacious.<br />\nStephen Tulloss<br /><br />\nbalance. I think you and your<br />\nstaff have done a very fine job in<br />\ndiscussing the issues which face<br />\nyour generation, and I would urge<br />\nyou to give deep thought in your<br />\ndiscussions.<br />\nI am disturbed, however, by<br />\nthe tasteless co:Aments of Art<br />\nLevine in His \"Elegy of a Belly.\"<br />\nFour letter Anglo-Saxon words<br />\nare not unknown to most of us,<br />\nbut we do not have to dignify<br />\ntheir use by publishing in a<br />\nquality paper such as the<br />\nNews-Letter. I have used the<br />\nNews-Letter in discussions with<br />\nmy young sons and with my<br />\nfriends. I have not been ashamed<br />\nthat it would be a gutter level<br />\ndialogue. Levine's article easily<br />\nreaches this level. The article itself<br />\nbetrays his extreme bias and his<br />\nutter lack of reportorial skill. I<br />\ndon't object to his position<br />\nespecially with the byline, and I<br />\nthink it could be a pleasant<br />\nexperience viewing the Wallace<br />\nrally through Levine's eyes. What<br />\nI object to is the poor taste and<br />\nuse of gutter level words in a<br />\npublication which deserves better.<br />\nW.R. McCartin<br />\nPhoenix, Maryland<br />\nMENDELSOHN IDOLIZED<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI just read Ed Mendelsohn's<br />\narticle about the ethnic<br />\nimplications of campaign '68. The<br />\npiece was well-written and totally<br />\n\"Ed Mendelsohn.\" He is a walking<br />\nprimary source, trivia expert in<br />\nthe history field. I thought I'd<br />\nacknowledge a fellow neighbor<br />\nfrom Far Rockaway and Hopkins.<br />\nHe did a great job. Don't lose him<br />\nfrom your staff - - he just might<br />\n\"make\" the News-Letter.<br />\n-Linda Wertheim<br />\nGoucher '71<br /><br />\nOn ROTC<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have always been very proud<br />\nthat Hopkins has had a paper that<br />\nhas not limited itself to merely<br />\nsupplying the academic<br />\ncommunity with news of campus<br />\nactivities but rather has seen fit to<br />\npresent a vigorous editorial as well<br />\nas news coverage of any matter<br />\nthat the staff feels affects the<br />\nstudent body. Everyone has<br />\nalways known where the<br />\nNews-Letter really stood on the<br />\nimportant issues of the day.<br />\nHowever, please allow me to<br />\ntake issue with your recently<br />\nexpressed opinions vis a vis<br />\nHopkins ROTC. As a member of<br />\nthe JHU Battallion for 4 years, let<br />\nme assure you that training<br />\n\"killers\" is not the primary goal<br />\nof the program. Rather, I believe<br />\nthat the goal is one of training<br />\ncollege educated men to assume<br />\npositions of leadership in the<br />\narmed forces.<br />\nI am not attempting to insist<br />\nthat eithei was or the Army or<br />\neven ROTC is \"right.\" Rather, I<br />\nbelieve that Hopkins men have a<br />\nEVEN MORE...<br />\n\"right\" to take ROTC, if they so<br />\nwish, just as they may take any<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nother<br />\ncourse that the University<br />\nAs a former student and writer<br />\nfor the News-Letter, I have may wish to offer and that they<br />\nfollowed the publication with are qualified to take. It seems<br />\ngreat interest. I have been difficult to believe that apostles of<br />\nimpressed by the maturing individual freedom (and I know<br />\nstudents' growing awareness of that the News-Letter is among<br />\nthe more significant and those apostles) would deny<br />\nimportant elements which are students the right to take a course<br />\nvital to the existence of our they desire to take in preparing<br />\nsociety.

But I am To the Editors:<br />\nconfident that sheer age will be a<br />\nIn the introductory paragraph<br />\nmajor factor in redressing the of \"The Ballad of<br />\nthe Good<br /><br />\nSoldier S.,\" one receives the<br />\ndistinct impression that Mr.<br />\nSakowich sets out to tell a story,<br />\nan impression which remains as<br />\nlong as no one reads past the<br />\nsecond sentence. \"The author is<br />\nmerely trying to tell a story in a<br />\nparticular style designed to best<br />\nobtain his ends.\" Now if telling a<br />\nstory is all that he countenances,<br />\nthen the last phrase is superfluous.<br />\nBut what we have here is not<br />\nsuperfluity (which the reader soon<br />\ndiscovers) but a hint that the<br />\nauthor wishes to proselytize<br />\nwithout fear of counter-argument.<br />\n(Ah, c'mon folks, I'm only telling<br />\na story.)<br />\nDespite S.'s totemic<br />\nindifference, an analysis of his<br />\nballad can do him nothing but<br />\ngood. The first sentence braces<br />\none for things to come. \"In a<br />\nsunny corner of Southeast<br />\nVirginia,\" (Get it, folks-what do<br />\nyou really expect after<br />\n\"Southeast\") \"Sok very excitedly<br />\nwatched a large Crusader Jet<br />\nfighter shaft the beach . .\"(Note<br />\nthe choice of adverb-everyone<br />\nrealizes that a display of emotion<br />\nover such a thing is a no-no.)<br />\nBut let's follow in Sak's<br />\nfootsteps and not get hung up<br />\nwith logic or analysis.

This would give<br />\nWallace 128 electoral votes,<br />\nleaving 410 electoral votes outside<br />\nthe South to be divided between<br />\nNixon and Humphrey. If either<br />\nmajor-party candidate carried 66<br />\nper cent of the electoral vote in<br />\nthese remaining non-southern<br />\nstates (270 electoral votes out of<br />\n410), then that major-party<br />\ncandidate would have a clear<br />\nelectoral college majority despite<br />\nWallace's exceptionally strong<br />\nshowing in the South.<br />\nAt lower levels of Wallace<br />\nelectoral college strength, an even<br />\nsmaller percentage of the<br />\nremaining electoral college vote<br />\nwould give one of the major-party<br />\ncandidates an electoral college<br />\nmajority. This point becomes<br />\nclear if one imagines three<br />\ndifferent levels of electoral college<br /><br />\nstrength for Wallace that might be<br />\nreached in this November's<br />\nelection:<br /><br />\nIf Wallace<br />\ngets:<br /><br />\nAll II states of<br />\nformer Confederacy<br />\nthe Deep South:<br />\nAla., Ga., La.,<br />\nMiss., S.C.<br />\nAlabama and<br />\nMississippi<br /><br />\nA major-party Presidential nominee<br />\nwould need the<br />\nfollowing % for<br />\nan electorial<br />\ncollege majority.<br /><br />\nWallace's<br />\nvote<br />\nwould<br />\nbe:<br />\n128<br /><br />\n66%<br /><br />\n47<br /><br />\n55%<br /><br />\n17<br /><br />\n52%<br /><br />\nSome of the above electoral<br />\ncollege statistics may look hard to<br />\nreach, but the odds are that one<br />\nof the major-party candidates will<br />\nreach them - - even the 66% figure<br />\n- - because a small percentage lead<br />\nin the popular vote is usually<br />\ntranslated into a much larger<br />\npercentage of the electoral college<br />\nvote.<br />\nMultiplier Effect<br />\nThere are a number of<br />\nexamples of the \"multiplier<br />\neffect\" as it affects the electoral<br />\ncollege. FDR in 1944, with 53.5%<br />\nof the popular vote, got over 82%<br />\nof the electoral college vote. And<br />\nLyndon Johnson, in 1964, with<br /><br />\n%woe<br /><br />\nFAILURE<br /><br />\ntiso<br /><br />\nof the popular vote, receiy(,;(1<br />\nabout 90% of the electoral college<br />\nvote.<br />\nAs Professor Charles Bischcff<br />\nof Yale has demonstrated (1)y<br />\nanalyzing the relationship<br />\nbetween the popular vote and tl<br />\nelectoral college vote in the fo,.ur<br />\npresidential elections since 195 !),<br />\neven if Wallace carried all I,18<br />\nsouthern electoral votes, if Nix()0<br />\nor Humphrey had about a foUI<br />\npercentage point lead in tlhe<br />\nmajor-party vite in the remainiing<br />\n39 states(52.5% to 47.5%), Nix()n<br />\nor Humphrey would prolably<br />\nhave a clear majority in tlhe<br />\nelectoral college. If Wallace carn es<br />\nonly the five Deep South states, a<br />\ntwo per cent lead for one of the<br />\nmajor-party candidates in the<br />\npopular vote in the remaining'45<br />\nstates (51% to 49%) should giye<br />\nthe presidential candiate who is in<br />\nthe lead a clear electoral college<br />\nmajority. If only Alabama a]<br />\nMississippi go for Wallace, a one<br />\npercentage point popular vc te<br />\nlead in the remaining 48 sta1 es<br />\nwould probably produce a de ar<br />\nelectoral college majority.<br />\nAs this is written, virtually all<br />\nthe national polls give Nixon a<br />\nlarge lead over Humphrey (eiEht<br />\npercentage points or more) in the<br />\npopular vote. In the se<br />\ncircumstances, there seems to be<br />\nlittle chance of Nixon failing to<br />\nget an electoral college majority - no matter how many stal es<br />\nGeorge Wallace carries in the<br />\nSouth. If, however, the pi011<br />\nresults in early November shc<br />\nthat the popular vote gap between<br />\nthe two major-party candidal es<br />\nhas narrowed - - particularly if<br />\nthe gap is four per cent or smaller<br />\n- - then the possibility that the re<br />\nmay be no electoral colle Se<br />\nmajority cannot be ruled out(the<br />\nlatest Harris Poll has narrowed<br />\nNixon's lead to 5 percenta ge<br />\npoints).<br />\nLikely Outcome<br />\nWhat, then, would be the likely<br />\noutcome if the election were<br />\nthrown into the House?

At<br />\npresent, the Republicans control<br />\nonly 18 of the 50 state<br />\nuelegations - - and the votes of 26<br />\nstate delegations would be<br />\nrequired to elect the President in<br />\nthe House. Even if the party<br />\ncontrol were to change (as well<br />\nmight happen), the Republicans<br />\n'lave a long way to go to increase<br />\nthe number of delegations they<br />\ncontrol from 18 to 26.<br />\nOn the other hand, if the Deep<br />\nSouth nominally Democratic state<br />\ndelegations were to decide to<br />\nthrow their support to Nixon,<br />\nthen Nixon might have a chance<br />\nin the House. What one can be<br />\nsure of is that the pressures and<br />\nthe bargaining would be intense if<br />\nthe election were thrown in the<br />\nHouse.<br />\nMy own feeling is, however,<br />\nthat the election will not be<br />\nthrown into the House - - even if<br />\n00 presidential candidate gets a<br />\nclear electoral college majority. It<br />\nis more likely that if there is no<br />\nelectoral college majority, George<br />\nWallace would, after trying to<br />\nObtain whatever understandings it<br />\nWas possible for him to obtain,<br />\nthrow enough of his electoral<br />\ncollege support to one of the<br />\nMajor -party presidential<br />\ncandidates to elect Nixon or<br />\nHumphrey via the electoral<br />\ncollege route. He could, for<br />\nexample, hold a meeting of his<br />\nviz<br /><br />\nelectors in Montgomery, Alabama,<br />\nin late November, and there, in<br />\nfull view of the television cameras,<br />\nannounce that, in order to avert a<br />\nserious Constitutional crisis, he<br />\nhas instructed his electors to cast<br />\ntheir votes for Nixon, or for<br />\nHumphrey.<br />\nWallace Behavior<br />\nThere are several reasons why<br />\none might expect Wallace to<br />\nbehave in this fashion. First, as<br />\nHopkins' election expert Richard<br />\nM. Scammon has pointed out in a<br />\nrecent article in the Washington<br />\nPost, Wallace has a more direct<br />\npersonal control over the probabre<br />\nbehavior of his handpicked slates<br />\nof presidential electors than he<br />\ndoes over the Congressmen - even those from southern states - who sit in the House. The<br />\npresidential electors are his people<br />\nin a way that the Congressmen,<br />\nwith their own political base and<br />\ntheir own constituencies, are not.<br />\nWallace can be surer that ,the<br />\npresidential electors will do what<br />\nhe wants them to do than he can<br />\nthat the Congressmen will do as<br />\nhe wishes. Second, by behaving in<br />\nthis fashion, Wallace could help<br />\navert a serious constitutional<br />\ncrisis, and could get the credit for<br />\nthis from the American public. He<br />\ncould also thus be seen as a<br />\ndecisive factor in the electoral<br />\noutcome - - all of which would<br />\nleave him with a strong base for a<br />\nfuture try for the Presidency in<br />\n1972. By doing this, he would<br /><br />\nappear as a responsible leader who<br />\ngave the voters the opportunity to<br />\nregister their preferences, and<br />\nthen decided the final winner<br />\nwithin the normal framework of<br />\nthe Constitution.<br />\nFinally, there is still another<br />\nreason why it looks as though<br />\nWallace would not stand by and<br />\nwatch the final presidential choice<br />\nbe transferred to the House of<br />\nRepresentatives. Wallace, himself,<br />\nhas already tipped his hand as to<br />\nwhat he thinks would happen if<br />\nno one gets a majority in the<br />\nelectoral college.<br />\nWallace apparently first did<br />\nthis on the CBS-TV program<br />\n\"Face the Nation\" on July 21,<br />\n1968, where he said that the<br />\npresidential contest would be<br />\ndecided before the election was<br />\nthrown into the House. But on<br />\nSeptember 8, in an interview with<br />\neditors and writers of the Miami<br />\nHerald, he made the trend of his<br />\nthinking even clearer. Then he<br />\nsaid: \"I don't believe it is going to<br />\ngo to the House of<br />\nRepresentatives . . . the electoral<br />\ncollege meets first . . . I'd say the<br />\nelectoral college would settle the<br />\nPresidency before it gets to the<br />\nHouse.\"<br />\nBargaining<br />\nWhen asked if he expected<br />\n\"some bargaining\" in the electoral<br />\ncollege, Wallace replied, \"I don't<br />\nthink it will be a 'bargaining'<br />\nproposition. It will be a matter of<br />\nopen . . . covenants representing<br /><br />\nthe viewpoint of people. If I get as<br />\nmany votes - - popular votes - - as<br />\neither of the other candidates,<br />\nthen that group of people are<br />\nentitled to have some<br />\nrepresentation in the attitude of<br />\nthe new administration.\"<br />\nWhether it's called<br />\n\"bargaining\" or \"solemn<br />\nconvenants\" (the distinction is an<br />\nelusive one), it appears that<br />\nWallace Hopes to do some hard<br />\nbargaining with one of the major<br />\npresidential nominees in return<br />\nfor some or all of the electoral<br />\nvotes of Wallace presidential<br />\nelectors.

He realizes that lacrosse<br />\nhas the tradition here but that<br />\nfootball does not. The first-string<br />\nall-American attackman feels that<br />\nhis and Coach Sotir's primary goal<br />\nis creating a football tradition at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nJoe's sense of service is perhaps<br />\nthe strongest motivating factor in<br />\nhis life. When choosing between<br />\nHopkins and Navy he finally<br />\ndecided on Hopkins for two<br />\nreasons: the first because after his<br />\nfather died, he wanted to stay<br />\nnear home to be better able to<br />\nfulfill his family responsibilities<br />\nand the second, that he wanted to<br />\nplay big time lacrosse and<br />\nfootball. Cowan now feels that he<br />\nmight have considered Maryland<br />\nmore with hindsight because of<br />\ntheir courses in transportation<br />\nindustries (the family business is<br />\ntrucking) but that the general high<br />\nlevel of Hopkins courses would<br />\nprobably override that in the end<br />\nanyway.<br />\nKnocks Negative Protest<br />\nJoe also has his own ideas on<br />\nthe student protest movements.<br />\nHe began school less tolerant of<br />\nthe far left \u2014 disgusted with<br />\nshoulder length hair and the<br />\nwhole concept of negative protest<br />\n(with which he still disagrees).<br />\nBut, in his four years here, he has<br />\ngrown to recognize that these<br />\npeople, even if he cannot<br />\nunderstand them, have a right to<br />\ntheir beliefs. Cowan views the<br /><br />\nnational consciousness as being<br />\nseized by trends and what he feels<br />\nis prevelant now is the idea \"do<br />\nyour own thing.\"<br />\nHowever, Joseph is upset at.the<br />\nattitude, once so prevelent at<br />\nHopkins and which now lurks in<br />\nhe background, of unconcern for<br />\nfootball and religious attachment<br />\nto lacrosse \u2014 a type of hypocrisy<br />\nin Cowan's eyes. To Joe, this<br />\ndiscourages many fine athletes<br />\nfrom participating and he feels<br />\nthat this is a loss to the individual<br />\nand the school.<br />\nPro Potential<br />\nContemplating being drafted,<br />\nJoe emphasized that he would<br />\nonly play when he proved to<br />\nhimself that he had the ability. If<br />\nhe does not play pro ball, he plans<br />\nto work in his family trucking<br />\ncompany to do as much as<br />\npossible to help his family.<br />\nIf asked what Cowan's \"own<br />\nthing\" might be, I am sure that<br />\nthe average Hopkins sports fan<br />\nwould reply football or lacrosse_<br />\nHowever, I am not so sure he<br />\nwould be right. For Joe Cowan is<br />\na person who has attempted to<br />\nlive up to his responsibilities as he<br />\nhas seen them. He is a person who<br />\nhas thought deeply on what he<br />\nhas learned in his college career<br />\nand been mature enough to<br />\nchange his views when he felt<br />\nthem to be wrong.

Present on the panel<br />\nwere Dr. Furstenburg of the<br />\nHopkins Medical School. Dr.<br />\nChissel, a private practitioner and<br />\na member of several state medical<br />\nadvisory committees, Mrs.<br />\nFlanagan and Mrs. MacDowell,<br />\nwhose families were cut from the<br />\nhealth care, Miss Thomas of the<br />\nHopkins Medical School, and<br />\nRepublican Senatorial Candidate<br />\nCharles Mathias. Incumbent<br />\nSenator Brewster was not present.<br /><br />\nThe moderator, Reverend<br />\nDobson, introduced the meeting<br />\nby pleading for action against the<br />\n\"emasculation\" of the Medicaid<br />\nprogram.

Before July<br />\nher 10 children were able to go to<br />\nthe doctor, but now food and<br />\nclothing preempt their visits. Her<br />\nteenage daughter has one lung and<br /><br />\nmust have \u2022frequent treatments.<br />\nShe was going to the hospital<br />\nunder the Medicaid plan. \"But<br />\nnow when she asks me to take her<br />\nto the hospital, I have to lei' my<br />\nchild to wait 'til Friday when I get<br />\npaid.\"<br />\nCongressman Mathias followed<br />\nMrs. Flanagan and began by<br />\nrestating statistics on health care.<br />\n\"Fifteen million young Americans<br />\nhave \u2022received no medical care.<br />\nHalf of our children under 15<br />\nhave never seen a dentist office.\"<br />\nHowever, he seemed shakened by<br />\nMrs. Flanagan's plight, and told<br />\nthe audience, \"We in Washington<br />\nwill have to help.
