Everything is in readiass for the rise of the<br />\ncurtain at the Lyric: Theatre on Thursday evening.<br />\nHaving depicted the trials and tribulations of an aristocratic<br />\npugilist, the campus mimes now turn their attention to one of those<br />\nmythical kingdom extravaganzas, so dear to the heart of Richard<br />\nHarding Davis or the late George Barr McCutcheon. This year,<br />\nthe Barnstormers will dramatize the adventures of one -Anthony<br />\nHamilton Hawthorne of.the United States of America. .Jack Deets,<br />\nin the title role, will be given an opportunity to romp among the<br />\nprime ministers, emperors, chancellors and army officers of the famous principality of Borrovina. Although this empire does not<br />\nappear on the maps, published in standard atlases, the author vouches<br />\nfor the fact that it is located somewhere in southeastern Europe.<br />\nIn this Balkan state, the Barnstormers will portray the crafty diplomacy of bewhiskered councilors of state, turbulent love scenes in<br />\nthe palace garden and other ingredients of melodrama, romance and<br />\nmystery which will certainly make the production another sure-fire<br />\n\u2022<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nEvei since their organization, the Barnstormers have formed the<br />\nannoying habit of consistently staging successful shows. Old alumni<br />\nnever cease talking of the 'Stormers' productions of The Purple Mask<br />\nand The Galloper. Present undergraduates recall pleasant memories<br />\nof Evans Rodgers' splendid portrayal of the pants pressing hero<br />\nin The Tailor Made Man; Alger Hiss' capable characterization of<br />\nthe archeological fanatic in His Majesty Bunker Bean and Benny<br />\nBoynton's fine acting as a potential jack Dempsey in last year's production, The Champion.<br />\nBaltimore's dramatic critics, notoriously harsh in their condemnation of plays on the legitimate stage, have always hastened to<br />\ndrape laurel wreaths on the.-perspiring brows of the campus actors.<br />\nYear after year, the 13ornstorrnerlhows receive careful coaching<br />\nand directing from Mr, Swindell and the results of his efforts are<br />\nalways evident in the finished production. The undergraduate Barrymores play their roles with the technique of professional players.<br />\nTher7awkward, motions and mumbled lines, so characteristic of the<br />\naverage amateur actor, are entirely replaced by polished stage presence and clear cut enunciation. In place of the shoddy, dilapidated<br />\nscenery provided for the typical non-professional show, the Barnstormers construct stage sets which would do credit to the studio<br />\nof any Broadway scenic designer.<br />\nNeither have the Barnstormers fallen into the errors of many<br />\nother college dramatic groups, who are attempting, with little or no<br />\nsuccess, to steal the Theatre Guild's glory. While the Goucher girls<br />\ndabble with the intricacies of Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra,<br />\nthe Hopkins boys are content to play Mr. Fagan's melodramatic work<br />\nwhich is so suited to the youthful exuberance of the average undergraduate actor. While other college theatrical organizations stumble<br />\nup the Parnassian heights with Eugene O'Neil, Ibsen and Strindberg, the Barnstormers are willing to produce light dramatic fare<br />\nThe Hopkins group subscribes to the sensible theory that it is far<br />\nbetter to present light farce in an entertaining fashion than to desecrate the masterpieces of the geniuses of our modern theatre by<br />\ngiving them an inadequate production.<br />\nWhen the final curtain comes rustling down on the last scene<br />\nof Hawthorne of the U. S. A., we feel certain that the usual tumultuous applatir from the audience will herald still another Barnstormer success. After all, it is hard to overcome the habit of succeeding.<br />\n<br />\nR<br />\n<br />\nYALE IN 1800<br />\nUndergraduate life, during the<br />\nearly history of Yale, has been interestingly delineated in the diary of<br />\na certain Jeremiah Evarts, a native<br />\nof Georgia, Vt., who entered the<br />\nConnecticut institution in 1798.

The final nail has been hammered into the framework of the scenery, the last brushful of paint has been slapped on<br />\nthe back-drop, and the actors are perfecting their lines and \"business\"<br />\nfor the dress rehearsal. Everything is in readiass for the rise of the<br />\ncurtain at the Lyric: Theatre on Thursday evening.<br />\nHaving depicted the trials and tribulations of an aristocratic<br />\npugilist, the campus mimes now turn their attention to one of those<br />\nmythical kingdom extravaganzas, so dear to the heart of Richard<br />\nHarding Davis or the late George Barr McCutcheon. This year,<br />\nthe Barnstormers will dramatize the adventures of one -Anthony<br />\nHamilton Hawthorne of.the United States of America. .Jack Deets,<br />\nin the title role, will be given an opportunity to romp among the<br />\nprime ministers, emperors, chancellors and army officers of the famous principality of Borrovina. Although this empire does not<br />\nappear on the maps, published in standard atlases, the author vouches<br />\nfor the fact that it is located somewhere in southeastern Europe.<br />\nIn this Balkan state, the Barnstormers will portray the crafty diplomacy of bewhiskered councilors of state, turbulent love scenes in<br />\nthe palace garden and other ingredients of melodrama, romance and<br />\nmystery which will certainly make the production another sure-fire<br />\n\u2022<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nEvei since their organization, the Barnstormers have formed the<br />\nannoying habit of consistently staging successful shows. Old alumni<br />\nnever cease talking of the 'Stormers' productions of The Purple Mask<br />\nand The Galloper. Present undergraduates recall pleasant memories<br />\nof Evans Rodgers' splendid portrayal of the pants pressing hero<br />\nin The Tailor Made Man; Alger Hiss' capable characterization of<br />\nthe archeological fanatic in His Majesty Bunker Bean and Benny<br />\nBoynton's fine acting as a potential jack Dempsey in last year's production, The Champion.<br />\nBaltimore's dramatic critics, notoriously harsh in their condemnation of plays on the legitimate stage, have always hastened to<br />\ndrape laurel wreaths on the.-perspiring brows of the campus actors.<br />\nYear after year, the 13ornstorrnerlhows receive careful coaching<br />\nand directing from Mr, Swindell and the results of his efforts are<br />\nalways evident in the finished production. The undergraduate Barrymores play their roles with the technique of professional players.<br />\nTher7awkward, motions and mumbled lines, so characteristic of the<br />\naverage amateur actor, are entirely replaced by polished stage presence and clear cut enunciation. In place of the shoddy, dilapidated<br />\nscenery provided for the typical non-professional show, the Barnstormers construct stage sets which would do credit to the studio<br />\nof any Broadway scenic designer.<br />\nNeither have the Barnstormers fallen into the errors of many<br />\nother college dramatic groups, who are attempting, with little or no<br />\nsuccess, to steal the Theatre Guild's glory. While the Goucher girls<br />\ndabble with the intricacies of Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra,<br />\nthe Hopkins boys are content to play Mr. Fagan's melodramatic work<br />\nwhich is so suited to the youthful exuberance of the average undergraduate actor. While other college theatrical organizations stumble<br />\nup the Parnassian heights with Eugene O'Neil, Ibsen and Strindberg, the Barnstormers are willing to produce light dramatic fare<br />\nThe Hopkins group subscribes to the sensible theory that it is far<br />\nbetter to present light farce in an entertaining fashion than to desecrate the masterpieces of the geniuses of our modern theatre by<br />\ngiving them an inadequate production.<br />\nWhen the final curtain comes rustling down on the last scene<br />\nof Hawthorne of the U. S. A., we feel certain that the usual tumultuous applatir from the audience will herald still another Barnstormer success. After all, it is hard to overcome the habit of succeeding.<br /><br />\nR<br /><br />\nYALE IN 1800<br />\nUndergraduate life, during the<br />\nearly history of Yale, has been interestingly delineated in the diary of<br />\na certain Jeremiah Evarts, a native<br />\nof Georgia, Vt., who entered the<br />\nConnecticut institution in 1798.
