There are three factions party to<br />\nthe debate. One would like to concentrate on war and<br />\nmilitarism on campus, another on the Hopkins power<br />\nstructure and the third on possibilities for joint studentcommunity action.<br />\nThe Strike Committee is not equipped to tackle purely<br />\ncommunity problems. It doesn't have the manpower or<br />\nsufficient power of persuasion. What it is equipped to<br />\nexplore are issues like APL and Hopkins' ties with the<br />\ncity, state and national power structure. So far these<br />\nissues have gone untouched.<br />\nAn issue ripe for tackling, and one that could serve as<br />\na bridge from purely campus to campus and community<br />\naffairs, is the involvement of certain members of the<br />\nHopkins Board of Trustees in schemes to defraud black<br />\nhomebuyers.<br />\nTheir involvement is indirect as always. As bank<br />\npresidents, they have overseen loans totalling more<br />\nthan $1,000,000 to the Goldseker Realty Company and its<br />\nsubsidaries.<br />\nShunning social responsibility as a child's game, these<br />\nmen guide their banks' investments strictly on the basis<br />\nof projected financial returns. Admittedly, this is a<br />\nstandard business practice, but the same moral<br />\narguments used for the exclusion of military recruiting<br />\non campus should be applied to the involvement of a<br />\nsupposedly humanistic university in human exploitation.<br />\nThe Strike Committee failed its first test this year. It<br />\nhad the issue of ROTC on campus dumped in its lap, and<br />\ndid nothing. This may be a sign that the mass confrontation politics of last spring are gone. Or it may<br />\nmean that the Strike Committee is gone. We hope<br />\nneither is true.<br />\n<br />\n17051-1 TfIE FiPsy<br />\nSOTTok).<br />\n<br />\nAMEOCAK)<br />\nAQMY,U1J-<br />\n<br />\nFair and the Ugly<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nIt's been nearly a decade since people<br />\nstarted wondering what was going to become<br />\nof this younger generation when it grew up<br />\nand assumed its place in society. Well,<br />\nduring that period of time, the vanguard of<br />\nthat generation has grown up and what it's<br />\ndoing is putting on things like the Baltimore<br />\nCity Fair.<br />\nHeld last weekend, the Fair can only be<br />\ntermed a tremendous success, as it drew<br />\ntens of thousands to its downtown site. The<br />\nFair organizers managed to transform<br />\nCharles Center into an enjoyable, if<br />\nsomewhat unorthodox, fairgrounds.<br />\nThe Fair seemed an honest idealistic<br />\nreaction of people faced with a city that<br />\ninexplicably slept for nearly 50 years,<br />\ndreaming that its decaying neighborhoods<br />\nwere somehow quaint.<br />\nIt was the reaction of liberal people who<br />\nthink it is up to the haves to give to the havenots, designed to appeal to, perhaps to wake<br />\nup, the middle class of Baltimore. And that<br />\nwas who it attracted. Despite the population<br />\nbias in the area, the majority of the fairgoers were middle-class whites.<br />\nThe politics of the Fair reflected its liberal<br />\nleaning -- with an Alinsky-like emphasis on<br />\nthe neighborhood. Besides booths from<br />\nvarious city social agencies, the fair<br />\nfeatured displays by community groups who<br />\nhave declared war on one or more evils of<br />\nsociety. This unfortunately also attracted a<br />\nfew of the types who feign civic concern for<br />\nsocial-status reasons. It is significant that a<br />\nfair, traditionally the place for carefree<br />\nattitudes, now brings home the necessity for<br />\nconcerned action.

NAMOR<br />\nHorror movies have always been<br />\nPopular. From the silent \"Phantom<br />\nof the Opera\" and \"Dracula\" in<br />\n1931, audiences have exposed<br />\nthemselves to promises of being<br />\nstartled, shocked and mildly<br />\nfrightened.<br />\n.\"Frankenstein\" in 1932 was the<br />\nbig one. Boris Karloff's first starring<br />\nrole was such a fantastic success<br />\nthat Hollywood businessmen rapidly<br />\nworked to satisfy the new-found<br />\nmarket. Ghouls, vampires and<br />\nwerewolfs moved in next to Fields,<br />\nGable and Berkeley's dancing girls<br />\nas Americans took a cheap moment<br />\naway from the Depression.<br />\nIn all discussions of camp the<br />\nstandard cliche is \"the old movies<br />\nare still the best.\" With respect to<br />\nhorror films of the 1930's that cliche<br />\nis indisputably true. Perhaps it's<br />\nbecause the subjects were so novel,<br />\nPerhaps it's another proof of the<br />\ngeneral aesthetic principle that the<br />\noriginal expression of a popular art<br />\nform remains the most interesting.<br />\n\"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\"<br />\nwere entertainments of evil which<br />\nsensibly depicted nonsensical<br />\nsubjects. Like an alchemists brew,<br />\n.those films blended imagination<br />\nWith pseudo-fact, humor with terror,<br />\nall guided by the subtlely controlled<br />\nelement of melodrama.<br />\nThe best example of the 1930's<br />\nStyle of horror films is \"Werewolf of<br />\nLondon\" (1935), highwater mark of<br />\nthe genre. The original sawtooth, it<br />\nrelates the story of two unfortunate<br />\nlYcanthrophobes who battle for the<br />\nsalubrious mariphasa lumina<br />\nlupina, the sole cure for the<br />\nhomicidal impulses and total pelt<br />\nWhich afflict them during a full<br />\nMoon.<br />\nand<br />\nsuperstition<br />\nMedieval<br />\nscientific absurdity (the mariphasa<br />\n<br />\nflower blooms only under moonlight<br />\nand grows only in Tibet) are<br />\npresented in a matter-of-fact<br />\ndeadpan manner, as if the superstition were history and the science<br />\nlegitimate (though simultaneously<br />\nboth actors and audience are fully<br />\naware that is not so.)<br />\nThis sinister soberness is invisibly<br />\nbalanced with ludicrous social<br />\nsatire, some sophisticated humor<br />\nand a lot of low class music hall<br />\ngags. We know that we can laugh at<br />\nourselves laughing at the movie, for<br />\nthe actors are laughing at us and<br />\n<br />\nThe halcyon days of horror films: Elsa Lanchester and Boris k'arloff as anrarishea<br />\nbride and groom in flu, 1935 -Bride of Frankenstein.We are repulsed from the fantasy<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nworld of \"The Mummy's Ghost\"<br />\nYet while this is going on there<br />\n(1944) by the infantile inanity of the<br />\nremains enough conscious selfcharacters, locale and basic<br />\ndeception to make believable the<br />\nsituation.

A<br />\nrambling shapeless production, the<br />\ntalents of the two actors were<br />\nfrivilously wasted.<br />\nBut only in the 1930's did the ideal<br />\nharmony between authentic drama<br />\nand folklore comedy exist.<br />\nThereafter sloppy excesses were<br />\nindulged in in both directions.

The main theme is<br />\none stolen- directly from \"The<br />\nMummy\", a forgettable 1932 Karloff<br />\nfilm.

No attempt is made to<br />\n{five the characters substance, nor is<br />\nany humor (a very important<br />\ndement) introduced.

There are three factions party to<br />\nthe debate. One would like to concentrate on war and<br />\nmilitarism on campus, another on the Hopkins power<br />\nstructure and the third on possibilities for joint studentcommunity action.<br />\nThe Strike Committee is not equipped to tackle purely<br />\ncommunity problems. It doesn't have the manpower or<br />\nsufficient power of persuasion. What it is equipped to<br />\nexplore are issues like APL and Hopkins' ties with the<br />\ncity, state and national power structure. So far these<br />\nissues have gone untouched.<br />\nAn issue ripe for tackling, and one that could serve as<br />\na bridge from purely campus to campus and community<br />\naffairs, is the involvement of certain members of the<br />\nHopkins Board of Trustees in schemes to defraud black<br />\nhomebuyers.<br />\nTheir involvement is indirect as always. As bank<br />\npresidents, they have overseen loans totalling more<br />\nthan $1,000,000 to the Goldseker Realty Company and its<br />\nsubsidaries.<br />\nShunning social responsibility as a child's game, these<br />\nmen guide their banks' investments strictly on the basis<br />\nof projected financial returns. Admittedly, this is a<br />\nstandard business practice, but the same moral<br />\narguments used for the exclusion of military recruiting<br />\non campus should be applied to the involvement of a<br />\nsupposedly humanistic university in human exploitation.<br />\nThe Strike Committee failed its first test this year. It<br />\nhad the issue of ROTC on campus dumped in its lap, and<br />\ndid nothing. This may be a sign that the mass confrontation politics of last spring are gone. Or it may<br />\nmean that the Strike Committee is gone.

Well,<br />\nduring that period of time, the vanguard of<br />\nthat generation has grown up and what it's<br />\ndoing is putting on things like the Baltimore<br />\nCity Fair.<br />\nHeld last weekend, the Fair can only be<br />\ntermed a tremendous success, as it drew<br />\ntens of thousands to its downtown site. The<br />\nFair organizers managed to transform<br />\nCharles Center into an enjoyable, if<br />\nsomewhat unorthodox, fairgrounds.<br />\nThe Fair seemed an honest idealistic<br />\nreaction of people faced with a city that<br />\ninexplicably slept for nearly 50 years,<br />\ndreaming that its decaying neighborhoods<br />\nwere somehow quaint.<br />\nIt was the reaction of liberal people who<br />\nthink it is up to the haves to give to the havenots, designed to appeal to, perhaps to wake<br />\nup, the middle class of Baltimore. And that<br />\nwas who it attracted. Despite the population<br />\nbias in the area, the majority of the fairgoers were middle-class whites.<br />\nThe politics of the Fair reflected its liberal<br />\nleaning -- with an Alinsky-like emphasis on<br />\nthe neighborhood. Besides booths from<br />\nvarious city social agencies, the fair<br />\nfeatured displays by community groups who<br />\nhave declared war on one or more evils of<br />\nsociety. This unfortunately also attracted a<br />\nfew of the types who feign civic concern for<br />\nsocial-status reasons. It is significant that a<br />\nfair, traditionally the place for carefree<br />\nattitudes, now brings home the necessity for<br />\nconcerned action. The organizers seemed to<br />\nrealize that for Baltimore to survive its<br />\ncitizens can no longer afford to be carefree.<br />\nThe most popular displays were, of course,<br />\nthe traditional fun and entertainment,<br />\nthough the community concern groups were<br />\nnot far behind. There were also the crowds<br />\nwaiting to buy food, variously traditional<br />\nMaryland and blatantly commercial. All of<br />\nthis also produced the normal voluminous<br />\namounts of litter.<br />\nThe fair was fun. It was an attempt to<br />\nconimunicate all that is involved in living in<br />\na city; to make each person realize that he is<br />\na part of this city, with its heritage and its<br />\nproblems, and that he can enjoy one while<br />\nworking on the other.<br />\nThis seems to be the vision that this<br /><br />\nI PUSH THE SECOMP<br />\n6UTTON.<br /><br />\nt01-1-11,E T<br />\n12) MOT<br />\nalt0,65T1OM<br /><br />\nIMPATair<br /><br />\nphoto by evelyn speaks<br /><br />\nIt is difficult to say whether or not<br />\nBaltimore (or America) deserves such faith.<br />\nA city which for so long ignored its<br />\ninequalities, which allowed its ghetto to<br />\nspread its cancerous tentacles to the<br />\noutermost reaches, which seems to be a<br />\nshowcase only for problems that plague<br />\ncities; a city such as that might deserve only<br />\na hearty farewell.<br />\nIf the fair were only the dying throes of<br />\nBaltimore, a great deal too little, much too<br />\nlate, it is comforting to know that it was done<br />\nwith a sense of naivete. Perhaps it is only by<br />\nbeing naive that one can even attempt to<br />\nsolve such problems within this society.<br />\nFurther awareness seems only to lead into a<br />\nhopeless morass of radicalism or a falsely<br />\ncomforting cynicism.<br /><br />\nI PUYTh&amp; THRP<br />\nBUTTOK).<br /><br />\nPAC(FiCTs<br /><br />\nPEFEATeD<br />\n1M Tti6<br />\nFIEl.D OF<br />\nf3ATTLE,<br />\nWILL Cat<br />\nH01-16 Itd<br />\nHUMIL[ATM_<br /><br />\nPO5E-1 WIC FaR-Fli<br />\nBUTTOK).<br /><br />\nBECAUS6<br /><br />\nquestionable generation brings with it.

NAMOR<br />\nHorror movies have always been<br />\nPopular. From the silent \"Phantom<br />\nof the Opera\" and \"Dracula\" in<br />\n1931, audiences have exposed<br />\nthemselves to promises of being<br />\nstartled, shocked and mildly<br />\nfrightened.<br />\n.\"Frankenstein\" in 1932 was the<br />\nbig one. Boris Karloff's first starring<br />\nrole was such a fantastic success<br />\nthat Hollywood businessmen rapidly<br />\nworked to satisfy the new-found<br />\nmarket. Ghouls, vampires and<br />\nwerewolfs moved in next to Fields,<br />\nGable and Berkeley's dancing girls<br />\nas Americans took a cheap moment<br />\naway from the Depression.<br />\nIn all discussions of camp the<br />\nstandard cliche is \"the old movies<br />\nare still the best.\" With respect to<br />\nhorror films of the 1930's that cliche<br />\nis indisputably true. Perhaps it's<br />\nbecause the subjects were so novel,<br />\nPerhaps it's another proof of the<br />\ngeneral aesthetic principle that the<br />\noriginal expression of a popular art<br />\nform remains the most interesting.<br />\n\"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\"<br />\nwere entertainments of evil which<br />\nsensibly depicted nonsensical<br />\nsubjects.
