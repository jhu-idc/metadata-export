Of course, the whole trouble is with<br />\nthe delinquency of the Student Activities Council.<br />\nDean Berry may be perfectly sure that the Council is<br />\nthe most useful body on the campus, but sooner or<br />\nlater he must realize that the Council realizes that he<br />\nis the only one who should be running things. The<br />\norganization is too unwieldy and fritters away its<br />\ntime and the students' money. Find logic, if you<br />\ncan, in the fact that the Council, openly claimed to be<br />\nin charge of activities, hasn't even met for practically<br />\ntwo months. And that with the activities in the most<br />\nprecarious state they've been in for years.<br />\nThe answer is clear enough: everybody knows<br />\nthat the Dean is running things. And 'most everyone<br />\nwill admit that a single responsible controller is, an<br />\nadvantage. But why preserve the farce of a Council? And why doesn't the Dean go all the way and<br />\nundertake to clear up the matter of the $600 without<br />\nfurther ado?

But underneath it all, one sensed<br />\nthe simmering, indeed seething, of moral indignation.<br />\nYour whole article, if I am not mistaken, was a morally indignant plea for more moral indignation, a plea<br />\nfor men who could get hot under the collar at the<br />\nsight of human suffering and could utilize their accumulated stores of knowledge and culture for the<br />\nrealization of a vision guaranteed to do away with<br />\nthat suffering. The system of education at Hopkins,<br />\nyou potherously declared, does not and cannot turn<br />\nout such men. Ergo, the system of education at Hopkins is a failure.<br />\nLike all moral indignants, your vision is blurred<br />\nwhen you choke with indignation. You are prone<br />\nto dogmatism of an adolescent or puerile (if that<br />\nis less insulting) character. You are convinced of the<br />\ncogency of a solution and you flaunt that solution in<br />\nthe face of the world as the one and only. There is<br />\nno other god but a vision, and moral indignation is its<br />\nprophet. Far be it from me to belittle moral indignation or firm convictions. I thank God I can still<br />\nbecome morally indignant, and remember praying in<br />\nthe early years of my adolescence for convictions, for<br />\nan integrating principle that would be my salvation.<br />\nBut when you come along and propose as the only<br />\nsolution to our moral, social and intellectual problems<br />\na vision, a wraith rising out of the boiling cauldronof<br />\nmoral indignation, I call it narrow dogmatism, if not<br />\ndownright superstition. You throw out the scientific<br />\nmethod, you flippantly dispose of Stravinsky, Picasso,<br />\nFrance and Lucretius, or what they stand for, and<br />\nset up a wrath-bound Jehovah, who is dull and blind,<br />\nas judge.<br />\no\u2014o<br />\nNo, Eric, higher education is a failure for quite<br />\nother reasons. You will agree that, first of all, there<br />\nare two factors in the process\u2014the education and the<br />\n<br />\neducated. If the latter are a nonentity, there can't be<br />\nany reaction, any results. So we posit intelligent<br />\npeople. Now the object of education is to make intelligent people, no, not charming, but noble. And<br />\nyou will understand what I mean, when I explain the<br />\nprocess by which education can in most cases make<br />\nintelligent people noble.<br />\nThe object, or more clearly, the effect of learning<br />\nand culture is to create and satisfy emotions. Each<br />\nnew fact, each intellectual acquaintance, each successive horizon either satisfies an emotion or creates a<br />\nnew one. A venture into vector analysis, a deep appreciation of Sisley's shimmering 'scapes, or the recognition of beauty with Keats\u2014all these satisfy an<br />\nemotion or desire and possibly create one. And the<br />\nobject of education is to provide us with these experiences or show us how to get to them. And the educator is part of the same purpose. Now these emotions, once experienced, do not leave us as we were.<br />\nOur psyche is touched, affected, molded and enlarged.<br />\nAnd I, for one, presume for the better. In general,<br />\na man who has probed the springs of a varied and intelligent emotional experience cannot help but be more<br />\nunderstanding in his judgment, more noble in his<br />\ndecisions. He has known good and evil, sympathizes<br />\nwith them, and becomes possessed of a mature noble<br />\nwisdom that changes worlds and creates them. It<br />\nseems, Eric, that after all we both want men of vision.<br />\nBut I cannot \"see\" men whose vision is evolved out<br />\nof some frenetic hypnosis. I do not think the froth<br />\nof moral indignation is a true enough substance to<br />\nbuild visions on. The trouble with men of vision of<br />\nthe type you pray for is that the more vision they have,<br />\nthe less men they are.<br />\no\u2014o<br />\nKemler was right. He is a hopeful specimen.

And why doesn't the Dean go all the way and<br />\nundertake to clear up the matter of the $600 without<br />\nfurther ado?

But underneath it all, one sensed<br />\nthe simmering, indeed seething, of moral indignation.<br />\nYour whole article, if I am not mistaken, was a morally indignant plea for more moral indignation, a plea<br />\nfor men who could get hot under the collar at the<br />\nsight of human suffering and could utilize their accumulated stores of knowledge and culture for the<br />\nrealization of a vision guaranteed to do away with<br />\nthat suffering. The system of education at Hopkins,<br />\nyou potherously declared, does not and cannot turn<br />\nout such men. Ergo, the system of education at Hopkins is a failure.<br />\nLike all moral indignants, your vision is blurred<br />\nwhen you choke with indignation. You are prone<br />\nto dogmatism of an adolescent or puerile (if that<br />\nis less insulting) character. You are convinced of the<br />\ncogency of a solution and you flaunt that solution in<br />\nthe face of the world as the one and only. There is<br />\nno other god but a vision, and moral indignation is its<br />\nprophet. Far be it from me to belittle moral indignation or firm convictions. I thank God I can still<br />\nbecome morally indignant, and remember praying in<br />\nthe early years of my adolescence for convictions, for<br />\nan integrating principle that would be my salvation.<br />\nBut when you come along and propose as the only<br />\nsolution to our moral, social and intellectual problems<br />\na vision, a wraith rising out of the boiling cauldronof<br />\nmoral indignation, I call it narrow dogmatism, if not<br />\ndownright superstition. You throw out the scientific<br />\nmethod, you flippantly dispose of Stravinsky, Picasso,<br />\nFrance and Lucretius, or what they stand for, and<br />\nset up a wrath-bound Jehovah, who is dull and blind,<br />\nas judge.<br />\no\u2014o<br />\nNo, Eric, higher education is a failure for quite<br />\nother reasons. You will agree that, first of all, there<br />\nare two factors in the process\u2014the education and the<br /><br />\neducated. If the latter are a nonentity, there can't be<br />\nany reaction, any results. So we posit intelligent<br />\npeople. Now the object of education is to make intelligent people, no, not charming, but noble. And<br />\nyou will understand what I mean, when I explain the<br />\nprocess by which education can in most cases make<br />\nintelligent people noble.<br />\nThe object, or more clearly, the effect of learning<br />\nand culture is to create and satisfy emotions. Each<br />\nnew fact, each intellectual acquaintance, each successive horizon either satisfies an emotion or creates a<br />\nnew one. A venture into vector analysis, a deep appreciation of Sisley's shimmering 'scapes, or the recognition of beauty with Keats\u2014all these satisfy an<br />\nemotion or desire and possibly create one. And the<br />\nobject of education is to provide us with these experiences or show us how to get to them. And the educator is part of the same purpose. Now these emotions, once experienced, do not leave us as we were.<br />\nOur psyche is touched, affected, molded and enlarged.<br />\nAnd I, for one, presume for the better. In general,<br />\na man who has probed the springs of a varied and intelligent emotional experience cannot help but be more<br />\nunderstanding in his judgment, more noble in his<br />\ndecisions. He has known good and evil, sympathizes<br />\nwith them, and becomes possessed of a mature noble<br />\nwisdom that changes worlds and creates them. It<br />\nseems, Eric, that after all we both want men of vision.<br />\nBut I cannot \"see\" men whose vision is evolved out<br />\nof some frenetic hypnosis. I do not think the froth<br />\nof moral indignation is a true enough substance to<br />\nbuild visions on. The trouble with men of vision of<br />\nthe type you pray for is that the more vision they have,<br />\nthe less men they are.<br />\no\u2014o<br />\nKemler was right. He is a hopeful specimen.
