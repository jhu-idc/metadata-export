Fortsch<br />\nThe difference between meal plan rates<br />\nand the individual meal rates charged at the<br />\nTerrace Room is wide enough to assure<br />\nthat virtually all students who subscribe to<br />\na meal plan would save money by buying<br />\nmeals individually.<br />\nNevertheless, Bettye Miller, director of<br />\nAuxiliary Enterprises, and Kevin Finnegan, director of dining services for<br />\nSeiler's Enterprises, which provides food<br />\nfor the cafeterias at Homewood, believe<br />\nthat such a comparison is irrelevant<br />\nbecause the meal plan and casual rates cannot be compared.<br />\nIn two articles published in November,<br />\n1985, the News-Letter found that many<br />\nstudents who subscribe to meal plans actually spend more money to be on the plan<br />\nthan they would if they were to buy meals<br />\nindividually.<br />\n<br />\nAll students living on campus must purchase a fourteen or nineteen meal plan.<br />\nFreshmen living off campus must also<br />\nchoose one of these plans. Upperclassmen<br />\nliving off campus may choose a ten meal<br />\nplan, but are not required to purchase any<br />\nplan. Students may also switch plans in the<br />\nmiddle of the academic year.<br />\nUsing the current meal plan and casual<br />\nrates as bases, a student subscribing to a<br />\nmeal plan would have to eat between 99.1<br />\nand 172.8 percent of the meals available<br />\nto him to save money.<br />\nThe percentage reflect those for a meal<br />\nplan participant who eats meals in the Terrace Room in such a way that the average<br />\ncost for these meals, based on casual rates,<br />\nis roughly $3.60, the approximate average<br />\ncost of a casual meal in the Terrace Room.<br />\nIf a meal plan participant were to eat the<br />\nmost expensive meals available to him, the<br />\npercentages would be 99.1 to 152.0 per-<br />\n<br />\ncent. If a participant were to miss at least<br />\none meal at any time, his percentages<br />\nwould be higher.<br />\nAuxiliary Enterprises oversees and<br />\nchecks the quality of services of such campus institutions as the bank, bookstore, and<br />\ncafeterias, while Seiler's is a Universityhired contractor that has operated the<br />\ncafeterias since 1986.<br />\nAs a result of the disparity between meal<br />\nplan and casual rates, said Miller, some<br />\nstudents may believe that meal plan participants pay too much to be on the meal<br />\nplan.<br />\nShe said that such an assumption is a frequent misconception. Casual rates, which<br />\nare intended for the occasional guests at<br />\nthe Terrace Room, are $2.50 for a<br />\nbreakfast, $3.50 for a lunch or brunch,<br />\n$4.50 for a dinner, and $5 for a premium<br />\nSee FOOD,6<br />\n<br />\nboth the Deans of the SChoo<br />\n-1 -Of<br />\nArts and Sciences and<br />\nEngineering.<br />\n\"The office will report to the<br />\ntwo [Homewood] academic<br />\ndeans, whatever that office may<br />\nbe,\" said Lombardi.<br />\nIn the present administrative<br />\nstructure, Welch reports directly<br />\nto Lombardi and the two<br />\nacademic deans.

The American<br />\ngovernment and agencies such as<br />\nthe CIA were \"afraid that communist powers would take over<br />\nand seize the electorate\" of<br />\nseveral less-powerful countries.<br />\nLichenstein attributed interventionist policies of the United<br />\nStates as well as activism during<br />\nthe 1950s as being primarily<br />\nassociated with the policy of containment, an attempt to stop the<br />\nspread of communism. He added that much of American policy<br />\ncentered around that idea and was<br />\n<br />\nwholly involved in and aware of<br />\nit.<br />\nDuring the 1960s, however,<br />\ntimes had changed and interventionism began to take on negative<br />\nconnotations. \"Questions were<br />\nbeing raised about the role of the<br />\nCIA, \"explained Lichenstein. In<br />\nthe 1970s, amidst. the Vietnam<br />\nconflict, the topic of interventionism was a \"bad word.\"<br />\nLichenstein stressed that over<br />\nthe last thirty years, the \"uses of<br />\nAmerican power have become<br />\nmore subtle and sophisticated.\"<br />\nConsequently, the American<br />\ngovernment has difficulty concentrating its influence in one<br />\narea. He added that the American<br />\npublic seems to have lost interest<br />\nin the subject of foreign policy<br />\nbecause, in part, of its more complicated and widespread nature.<br />\nLichenstein believed this<br />\napathy must change, or else<br />\nserious problems will result for<br />\nthe government. He said that the<br />\npolicies of the Reagan Administration should be carried out<br />\nin administrations to come. Unfortunately, Europe, according to<br />\nthe ambassador, has lost faith in<br />\nthe objectives and word of<br />\nAmerican administrations as a<br />\nresult of events during the past<br />\nfew decades.<br />\nLichenstein's strong endorsement of Kemp for the presidency<br />\n<br />\nOurthree-year and<br />\ntwo-yearscholarships won't<br />\nmake college easier.<br />\n<br />\nresults from his belief that Kemp<br />\nhas \"the understanding and commitment. . .to articulate the ideas<br />\nof Reagan which presently are<br />\nstill in the nascent stages\" of<br />\ndevelopment.<br />\nDepicting a gloomy portrait for<br />\nthe future, Lichenstein added that<br />\na failure to recognize the major<br />\nproblems and confusions that<br />\nAmerican policy presents will<br />\nresult in the undermining of<br />\ndemocratic institutions. If the existing problems are not solved,<br />\nconcluded Lichenstein, \"our<br />\nJohn Misa<br />\nenemies will write about the Charles Lichenstein,<br />\nformer alternate delegate to the United Nations, who<br />\ndemocratic experiment as a fail- discussed current trends in American foreign<br />\npolicy at Wednesday's Coled attempt.\"<br />\nlege Republicans meeting.<br />\n<br />\nLibrary security guard dies<br />\nMichael \"Mickey\" Ford, evening security supervisor at the Milton S.

The many theatrical and musical productions attest to this,<br />\nas well as the exemplary turnout for Rush. So why can't we get a<br />\nlittle help around here?<br />\nIn past issues of the News-Letter we have published half-page appeals, both humorous and serious, and the response has been less than<br />\nideal. It is unfortunate that there aren't many other opportunities to<br />\nrecruit fresh blood; there is definitely something that the ads can't<br />\nconvey, although one did come close.<br />\nIn one ad, we made up some Greek letters and called ourselves<br />\nthe oldest fraternity on campus. Although we are, of course, not part<br />\nof the Greek system at Hopkins, and by no means are we an all-male<br />\norganization (not that I believe anyone thought that), there is something<br />\nabout the News-Letter that very much approximates the brotherhood<br />\nof a frat.<br />\nNow of course I am going to make this appeal from the editorial<br />\nand production point of view, because that is where I'd like to recruit<br />\npeople, to help share in the work and help reap of the rewards,<br />\nalthough sharing in the work is mostly what I had in mind. We of<br />\nthe post-writing staff come in, two or three nights a week, and work<br />\nside by side on a very worthy project. We have fun while we work,<br />\nmaking up all sorts of inane headlines (you should see the ones that<br />\ndon't get printed),joking with each other, and, as deadlines approach,<br />\nwatching everyone run around like a bluejay with its head cut off.<br />\nOf course, all signs of activity cease when the nightly pizzas arrive,<br />\nas well as on Thursday night at 10 as everyone settles down to watch<br />\nL.A.

This is a family well worth knowing, for unlike<br />\nmany other clubs with the intent of drawing people of similar interests,<br />\nwe draw people with all backgrounds and interests, necessary to<br />\npublish twenty-some pages on various and sundry topics.<br />\nGranted, after the first week you may still not want to drink out<br />\nof the same soda bottle with any of us.

They came<br />\nto live in the camps because of:<br />\n1) the propaganda of their leaders<br />\nin the '47 war that caused them<br />\nto flee their homes in baseless<br />\nfear of Israeli attack; and 2) the<br />\n<br />\nrefusal of the surrounding Arab<br />\nstates to receive them once they<br />\nfled voluntarily despite promises<br />\nto the contrary and ample ability<br />\nto resettle them.

The Palestinians need to<br />\nsee the lies that are their<br />\nresistance organizations' propaganda.

Does Erik Harrell believe<br />\nhis vendetta against Lee<br />\nDranikoff aids our understanding<br />\nof Palestinian rioting, and more<br />\nimportantly, does he care? Harrell implies that anyone concerned with the defense of Israel is<br />\nreactionary or, in his terms, a<br />\n\"Kahane.\" This fallacy is akin to<br />\ncalling every Palestinian an Abu<br />\nNidal or Yasser Arafat\u2014people<br />\nwho, much to Harrell's chagrin,<br />\nnot even all Palestinians emulate.<br />\nHarrell also chooses to ignore<br />\nthe number of moderate Arabs,<br />\nwho because they did not share<br />\nthe dream of the eradication of<br />\nIsreal, were killed by their fellow<br />\nArabs. Anwar Sadat was but the<br />\nmost prominent example. When<br />\nHarrell speaks of conditions in<br />\nGaza, he deliberately ignores that<br />\nit is Palestinians, not Israelis, who<br />\nare starving their own brothers<br />\nand sisters by denying them access, through intimidation tactics<br />\nand other violent forms of coercion, to their places of<br />\nemployments and to markets to<br />\npurchase food.<br />\nA similar situation prevails in<br />\nJudea and Samaria, where some<br />\nArabs live in villas paid for with<br />\nfunds \"procured\" from UNRWA projects to provide food and<br />\nhousing, while others continue to<br />\nlanguish in refugee camps. Harrell also ignores the fate of<br />\nPalestinian Arabs suffered at the<br />\nhands of their Shi'i Amal brothers<br />\nin Lebanon, as well as the<br />\n\"hospitality\" which King Hus-<br />\n<br />\nsein showed these Arabs in<br />\nSeptember, 1970.<br />\nThis does not mean that the<br />\nIsraelis have welcomed an Arab<br />\npresence in Israel, for this is not<br />\nthe case. But until the Palestinian<br />\n\"people\" stop being just another<br />\nweapon in the arsenal of the Arab<br />\nworld, we cannot reasonably call<br />\nthem victims or expect their situation to improve. When the goal<br />\nof the Arabs stops being Tel<br />\nAviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, then<br />\nit will be more realistic to discuss<br />\nthe future of Gaza, Judea, and<br />\nSamaria.

When Miss<br />\nWhite was unable to book Naked<br />\nPrey into her original choice of<br />\nvenue, she decided, on a recommendation from the Sub-Mensas,<br />\nto book into Chester's Place, also<br />\nknown as The Little Theater.<br />\nAlthough Miss White may regret<br />\nher decision, given the poor turnout by Hopkins students, the<br />\nHopkins music scene definitely<br />\nbenefited from the decision.<br />\nThe Sub-Mensas performed<br />\nfirst, to a crowd that consisted of<br />\nmore band members and friends<br />\nthan anything else. Two Hopkins<br />\nstudents were in attendance,<br />\ncounting myself. As the Mensas<br />\ntuned up and prepared to start, I<br />\nbraced myself for the worst.<br />\nLocal rumor had it that these guys<br />\nwere pretty bad, and my fears<br />\nwere only intensified by the<br />\nsomewhat vacant state of lead<br />\nsinger Damon (real name: Louis)<br />\nNorko, which I siispect had<br />\nsomething to do with the brown<br />\nbag from which he kept taking<br />\npulls. As they started into their<br />\n<br />\nfirst song, my fears were both<br />\nconfirmed and refuted. Mr.<br />\nNorko is of the Jello Biafra<br />\nCalifornia Hardcore Screamer<br />\nSchool of Vocalists, meaning that<br />\neverything that comes out of his<br />\nmouth is meant to sound like an<br />\naccusation or a pure statement of<br />\noutrage, and this, coupled with<br />\ngenerally mean-spirited, cynicalpunk lyrics, makes him sound<br />\nlike every hardcore front man to<br />\ncome down the pike since 1978.<br />\nThis is not so much bad as boring, and Mr. Norko's epileptic<br />\nthrashings on stage do nothing to<br />\nmake his performance any more<br />\ninteresting. The rest of the band,<br />\nhowever, is possessed of some<br />\npretty decent chops. The bass and<br />\ndrums quickly locked into a<br />\ngroove that was funky enough to<br />\nbe danceable, but simple enough<br />\nthat it didn't get in the way of the<br />\nguitar work. The rhythm and lead<br />\nguitars worked together to produce a sound that was rather<br />\nreminiscent of Led Zep, with the<br />\nrhythm creating a storm of fuzz<br />\nover which could be heard the ,<br />\nchiming voice of the lead like a<br />\ncry from the void. The SubMensas will be performing at<br />\nChester's again later this month,<br />\nso you should check them out for<br />\nyourselves.<br />\nAny standards for the evening<br />\nthat might have been set by the<br />\nSub-Mensas were quickly blown<br />\naway by Baltec, a three-piece<br />\nfrom Washington. Here is a<br />\ngroup that could melt steel with<br />\ntheir intensity, and comparisons<br />\n<br />\nto The Who, Sonic Youth, and<br />\nThe Replacements immediately<br />\ncome to mind. Drummer Sam<br />\nParker attacked his kit with such<br />\nferocity that the kick drum kept<br />\nscooting across the floor, and, at<br />\none point, the whole kit collapsed in the middle of a song. Mr.<br />\nParker, however, continued playing with whatever he had left,<br />\nbanging away at whatever would<br />\nstand the onslaught. For the first<br />\ntime in my life I thought I was actually going to see some drumheads destroyed, and I kept thinking 'Here's our answer to Keith<br />\nMoon.' Guitarist and lead<br />\nvocalist Bill Kite stuck to a heavymetal style guitar attack played<br />\nfast and low on the neck, yet Mr.<br />\nKite also displayed a versatility<br />\nthat kept the songs from becoming predictable. There was<br />\nsomething almost sexual in the<br />\nway he kept ramming his guitar<br />\nup against the stacks, trying to get<br />\nthem to feed back. Behind all this,<br />\nbassist David Nine managed to<br />\npound out a simple (and that is not<br />\nmeant as a cut) bass line that<br />\nhelped keep everything more or<br />\nless together. \"Houseboat,\" their<br />\nfinal song, turned into a wellcontrolled thrash fest, with both<br />\nMr. Kite and Mr. Nine on the<br />\nfloor in front of the drums pounding on their instruments. When<br />\nthe smoke finally cleared, I<br />\ndiscovered that I'd been holding<br />\nmy breath through most of the<br />\nsong. This, ladies and and<br />\ngentlemen, is what rock and roll<br />\nis all about. Get these men a<br />\n<br />\nrecording contract!<br />\nAlthough a hard act to follow,<br />\nThe Bags provided as much of a<br />\ngood time as Baltec, although in<br />\na slightly different way\u2014they're<br />\nthe biggest hams I've ever seen.<br />\nUnlike Angst, whom they'd<br />\nopened for the night before, these<br />\nguys do scissor-kick their way<br />\nthrough a tour. They also belch,<br />\neat microphones, get beer poured<br />\non their head (with a little help<br />\nfrom the guys in Baltec), and<br />\ngenerally engage in raucous<br />\nbehavior. These guys have fun on<br />\nstage, and it carries over into the<br />\naudience. I was having such a<br />\ngood time I didn't even mind it<br />\nwhen they trashed U2's \"I Will<br />\nFollow\"\u2014probably the best<br />\ncover of that song I've ever<br />\nheard. Musically, they're<br />\nsomewhat less than inspired,<br />\ncoming off sounding a lot like a<br />\nthree-piece version of the<br />\nRamones, but this should not be<br />\ninterpreted as a major fault.<br />\nWhen these guys get down to the<br />\nmusic, its quite clear that they're<br />\ndeadly serious about what they're<br />\ndoing, and they attack each song<br />\nwith an absolute relentlessness. In<br />\nfact, my only real criticism is that<br />\nthey should be a little less<br />\nrelentless and throw us an occassional change-up, if for no other<br />\nreason than to give the other stuff<br />\nmore impact. That they have the<br />\nversatility to do this was aptly<br />\ndemonstrated by their skill at<br />\ncovering other people's songs,<br />\nand their drummer's ability to imitate any drummer named. For<br />\n<br />\nanybody who might be interested,<br />\nthese guys have an album out on<br />\nRestless Records, a division of<br />\nEnigma Records.<br />\nWhen Naked Prey. the<br />\nheadliners, finally made it to the<br />\nstage at 12:45, they had a halfhour to play, and an audience of<br />\nsix. Much to their credit, they still<br />\nplayed every song for what it was<br />\nworth, barreling through each<br />\none like a runaway locomotive,<br />\nwith only enough of a pause between songs for front-man Van<br />\nChristian to call out the next one.<br />\nNaked Prey play a hard-boiled<br />\nWestern Blues, the kind of music<br />\nthat sounds like they've drank too<br />\nmany whiskeys alone in cheap<br />\ndive-bars, spent too many nights<br />\ncrossing the desert in an old pickup, and generally seen too much<br />\nof life at the edge in the American<br />\nWest. When these guys perform<br />\na song, you don't just hear it, you<br />\nfeel it, because they're playing as<br />\nmuch for themselves as for you.<br />\nYeah, Van Christian, I can feel<br />\nit, and that's also what rock and<br />\nroll is all about.<br />\nWhen the night finally ended,<br />\nI went downstairs to leave, only<br />\nto see most of the band members<br />\ngathered around the TV watching<br />\na Hammer Horror film. They<br />\nwere heavy-lidded and slackjawed, all fagged out from performing. I wanted to say<br />\nsomething about having put on<br />\nsuch a great show, but I figured<br />\nI'd let them zone out in peace.<br />\nHell, they'd all certainly earned<br />\nit.<br />\n<br />\nParadise Lost: Timely or out of date?<br />\nby Amy Reiter<br />\nThis month CenterStage is doing what most repertory theaters<br />\ndo not. They are producing a play<br />\nby Clifford Odets. Why do most<br />\ntheaters pass over Odet's work?<br />\nBecause it tends to be didactic,<br />\nout-of-date, and difficult to<br />\nwatch. Why is CenterStage producing Odets' Paradise Lost<br />\nanyway? Because they feel that it<br />\nhas an important and timely<br />\nmessage. Who is right?<br />\nParadise Lost charts the demise<br />\nof the American middle class<br />\nfamily as a result of the Great<br />\nDepression. The play begins in<br />\nthe Fall of 1932 when the Katz<br />\n<br />\nfamily is just beginning to feel the<br />\neffects of the Depression. They<br />\nare forced to modify their comfortable lifestyle, foregoing such<br />\nluxuries as a maid and a<br />\ncanary\u2014domestic help and<br />\ndomesticated animals. As the play<br />\ncontinues, the family business<br />\nsinks lower and lower until, in the<br />\nSpring of 1935, it finally goes<br />\nunder completely. The family is<br />\nbeing sucked into a sea of debts,<br />\nillness, desperation, and death.<br />\nThe only lifesaver Odets throws<br />\nthem comes in the form of<br />\nsocialist rhetoric that seems to imply that their ability to survive<br />\ncomes not from what they have,<br />\nbut from what they believe.<br />\n<br />\nOdets wrote the play in 1935<br />\nwhen the message certainly was<br />\ntimely. The actors and the audience at his experimental Group<br />\nTheatre in New York were struggling for survival themselves.<br />\nThey needed someone to speak<br />\nfrom them and for them. Odets<br />\nserved as a spokesperson for his<br />\ntime. He represented the lower<br />\nand middle classes and attempted<br />\nto impress upon them the need to<br />\nkeep fighting the social undertow.<br />\nAs a result, Odets' plays often<br />\nsurrender the realistic characters,<br />\nsetting and story to serve his<br />\nidealistic purpose. Such is the case<br />\nwith Paradise Lost. The first two<br />\nacts set up a Compelling story<br />\n<br />\nCharles Dumas, Stan Lachow, and Martin Rudy star in Paradise Lost at the Center Stage here in Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nabout a Jewish middle class family in dire economic trouble. His<br />\ndialogue is clean, crisp and<br />\nauthentic. We believe in his<br />\ncharacters as people.<br />\nIn the third act, however,<br />\nthings change. All of a sudden,<br />\nevery character becomes a symbol. Julie (Rudy Goldschmidt),<br />\nthe youngest son dying of \"the<br />\nsleeping sickness,\" quotes the<br />\nstock market statistics in his<br />\ndelirium. \"Oh,\" we exclaim. \"I<br />\nget it. He represents the stock<br />\nmarket. He kept moving in the<br />\nlast two scenes and now he's<br />\ncomatose. And when he tried on<br />\nthe tuxedo 'to make himself feel<br />\nbetter' it was like the false optimism of the market before it<br />\ncrashed.\"<br />\nPearl(Amy Griscom Epstein),<br />\nthe piano playing daughter who<br />\nspends most of her time in her<br />\nown musical world, is Odets'jab<br />\nat the arts. She is selfish,<br />\negotistical and indifferent to the<br />\nsuffering around her. \"Her piano<br />\nplaying is her life,\" the mother<br />\nobserves. Mr. Pike (Charles<br />\nDumas), the furnace man, is the<br />\nangry lower class. Leo (Stan<br />\nLachow), the father, is the blind<br />\noptimist.<br />\nAs we go through this mental<br />\nsymbolic checklist, the play loses<br />\nsome of its human-to-human appeal. The characters seem much<br />\nless like real people. As the play<br />\nconcludes we realize that the<br />\nstage is a soapbox and the words<br />\nare not dialogue but socialist<br />\ndogma. We have<br />\nbeen<br />\nmanipulated.<br />\n<br />\nOdets was a clever man. He<br />\nwanted to manipulate his audience back in 1935, to shake<br />\nthem out of their complacency<br />\nwhich, to him, was tantamount to<br />\ndeath. The audience may even<br />\nhave wanted to be manipulated.<br />\nThat is why his plays have gone<br />\ndown in history as masterpieces<br />\nof their time.<br />\nNowadays, the plays go unproduced, unperformed. Propaganda does not weather well.<br />\nMessages which may have seemed desperate and justifiable in the<br />\n1930's seem empty and useless<br />\ntoday. After Black October it is<br />\neasy to understand how<br />\nCenterStage saw a connection<br />\nbetween the 1930's and the<br />\n1980's. It is not Odets' message<br />\nthat is obsolete; it is his agit-prop<br />\nstyle. He's too confrontational,<br />\nnot subtle enough for modern audiences. We can hear speeches on<br />\ntelevision about the sad state of<br />\nthe economy. In the theater we<br />\nexpect the message to come in a<br />\nstory, like a coated pill. Odets<br />\nstory melts away at the end,<br />\nrendering the message hard to<br />\nswallow.<br />\nThe CenterStage approached<br />\nthis play with thought and sensitivity. Anna Berger is perfect in<br />\nher role as the mamma, Clara<br />\nGordon. Each member of this<br />\ntwenty-four member cast adds<br />\nsomething to the whole. Unfortunately, even this tender production cannot save the audience<br />\nfrom Odets' stale anger.

Now, I said to myself,<br />\nany group that names itself after<br />\none of the main characters in<br />\nThomas Pynchon's V has got to<br />\nbe interesting. Sadly enough,<br />\nthere are no Pynchon references<br />\nhere, not even a damned kazoo.<br />\nOne should not be disappointed<br />\ntoo much by this fact, however,<br />\nsince you do manage to get some<br />\ncool music in the deal. Benny<br />\nProfane sounds a bit like a<br />\ncleaned-up version of The Jesus<br />\nand Mary Chain wired on coke.<br />\nThey're moody (isn't anybody<br />\nover there happy?), and yet<br />\nsomehow possessed of a vigorous<br />\nvitality. This vitality is a function<br />\nof Dave Jackson's acrobatic tenor<br />\nvocals (I'm guessing who does<br />\nwhat, since the album cover<br />\ndoesn't say), a bright,jangly lead<br />\nguitar, and a rhythm section that<br />\nkeeps things moving nicely<br />\nwithout resorting to a dance-hall<br />\nstomp beat. And though this<br />\ndescription might make them<br />\nsound a bit like The Smiths,<br />\nthey're post-punk enough to incorporate some stinging feedback<br />\ninto \"Beam Me Up,\" a song<br />\n<br />\nabout a man being driven to<br />\nmurder by junk food (I think),<br />\nand put some fast tempos and genuine anger into songs like<br />\n\"Stitch That\" and \"Credulous as<br />\nHell.\" This is good music with<br />\nwit, feeling, and some nice<br />\nmusical chops, and I reccommend<br />\nit without reservation. And, if<br />\nyou happen to find a whole album<br />\nby these guys, could I borrow it<br />\nfrom you?<br />\nRick Astley is new to our<br />\nshores, and RCA was kind<br />\nenough to send me a copy of his<br />\nlatest album Whenever You Need<br />\nSomebody. Hmm, Linn drums,<br />\nmulti-tracked vocals recorded on<br />\nCalred Soundfield Microphones,<br />\nFairlight effects .. . in other<br />\nwords, the most fun you can have<br />\nwith this album is trying to figure<br />\nout all the production techniques<br />\nthat went into it. This is not surprising, since it is a Stock, Aitken<br />\nand Waterman production. They<br />\nwrote five of the songs (Astley<br />\nwrote four), played the guitars<br />\nand keyboards, and even put \"A<br />\nStock Aitken Waterman Production\" under Astley's picture on<br />\nthe back. After reading this guy's<br />\nbio, it becomes perfectly clear<br />\nthat this was just some guy SAW<br />\npicked out to be the pretty face<br />\nthat would sell their songs and<br />\nmake them a lot of money. This<br />\nmight sound cynical, but these are<br />\nthe guys who said that all popsongs were basically a disposable<br />\nproduct, an attitude which might<br />\n<br />\nbe expected from a group of producers who sound like a law firm.<br />\nBasically, these guys have a stock<br />\nmid-eighties dance-hall sound<br />\nwhich they put behind whatever<br />\nface they can dig up. In this case,<br />\nit's a shame they decided to pick<br />\non this poor kid, since he does<br />\nhave a lot of vocal talent.<br />\nAnybody who has the balls to<br />\ncover Nat King Cole, and pull it<br />\noff, is one hell of a talented<br />\nvocalist, and deserves better<br />\ntreatment than this. Unfortunately, he's already been compared to<br />\nfellow Welshman Tom Jones,<br />\nwhich has him marked as being<br />\nterminally unhip, and therefore<br />\ndoomed his career.

The Giants all<br />\ngathered around home plate to greet \"Mud<br />\nFoot\" as he loped in for the winning run.<br />\n\"Way to go, 'Mud Foot!'\" roared Coach<br />\nHenson. \"How does it feel to be a hero?\"<br />\n\"I'll tell you in a second, Coach,\" said \"Mud<br />\nFoot\" as he made his way through the crowd<br />\ntowards the woods. \"I got to do something<br />\nfirst.\"<br />\nCoach Henson nodded in approval. \"Take<br />\nyour time,'Mud Foot', take your time.\"<br />\n<br />\nby Andy Gray<br />\nMr. Henson wasn't a very large man. He<br />\ndidn't even look particularly athletic. But to<br />\nthe fourteen six year olds on the Wamsutter<br />\nGiants, the Cap-League baseball team that he<br />\ncoached, he was Willie Mays, Babe Ruth, and<br />\nWillie Stargell all wrapped into one. And<br />\nabove all, he was fair; instead of playing the<br />\ntraditional none players on the field, Mr. Henson had all fourteen of his kids take to the field<br />\nfor defense, cluttering up the infield where<br />\nfour young boys all said they were the<br />\nshortstop\u2014two between first base and second,<br />\nand two more between second base and third.<br />\nNever mind that only one of them was right;<br />\nthey were all convinced that they were playing shortstop, and that's all that mattered to<br />\nMr. Henson.<br />\nIn one particular game, the game that this<br />\nstory is concerned with, the Wamsutter Giants<br />\nwere playing the Winnemucca Indians, and,<br />\nunfortunately, the Indians were getting the<br />\nbetter of the Giants. The Tribe's onslaught<br />\nbegan in the very first inning. There was one<br />\nman on base and two outs when famed Indian<br />\npower hitter Billy \"Loost Tooth\" Collins nailed a ball well into deep center field, which, by<br />\nthe way, is about twenty five feet beyond second base in the Cap-League. Giant's outfielder Doug \"Four Eyes\" Hathaway was in<br />\nposition under the ball.\"Doug,\" yelled Coach<br />\nHenson, \"Dougy, catch the ball!\" Unfortunately, the bit of coaching was enough to<br />\ndistract \"Four Eyes\" from his mission, and the<br />\nball hit him squarely on the head, sending<br />\nHathaway to the dirt as one of the Indians<br />\nscored and \"Loose Tooth\" got a stand up<br />\ndouble.<br />\nCoach Henson walked out to center field.<br />\nDoug was still sitting on the ground, legs crossed Indian style. \"Doug,\" he said,\"You've got<br />\nto keep your eye on the ball, okay,son?\" Doug<br />\nnodded and started to get up. \"All right, son,<br />\nnow let's play some ball!\"<br />\nThe score remained one to nothing until the<br />\ntop of the sixth, and in Cap League, final inning, when again, with one man on base, the<br />\nfeared \"Loose Tooth\" took the batter's box.<br />\n\"Loose Tooth\" unleashed another powerful<br />\ncrack of the bat, sending the ball into far left<br />\nfield. Coach Henson looked out to left field<br />\nfor his usually competent fielder, Ed \"Mud<br />\nFoot\" Murphy, but \"Mud Foot\" was strangely absent from his position, and the ball fell<br />\ninto left field and rolled so far that \"Loose<br />\nTooth\" was able to trot the bases leisurely,<br />\nspreading the Tribe's lead to three to naught.<br />\nJust as the Indians' slugger was finishing his<br />\nvictory trot, \"Mud Foot\" walked out of the<br />\nwoods that lined left field, pulling up the zipper on his trousers. Coach Henson took to the<br />\nfield again.<br />\n\"Hey, Mud Foot, where were you?\" said<br />\nCoach Collins.<br />\n\"Well, gee,\" said Mud Foot as he stammered<br />\nfrom foot to foot,\"I really had to pee, Coach.\"<br />\n\"Well, that's okay, Mud Foot.

Andrews<br />\nWarner Books, September, 1987,<br />\n$16.95<br />\nby Aravinda Pillalamarri<br />\nThe San Francisco Review of<br />\nBooks calls her genre \"Visionary<br />\nAutobiography.\" This is precisely why Crystal Woman fails to inspire the readers' credulity in<br />\nrespect to visions with its author,<br />\nLynn V. Andrews, has seen or of<br />\nthe prophetic value and mystically revelatory nature of the lessons<br />\nshe has to teach. Andrews has<br />\nwritten Medicine Woman, Flight<br />\nof the Seventh Moon, Jaguar<br />\nWoman, and Star Woman. Now,<br />\nin the form of Crystal Woman,<br />\nshe proposes to relate the story<br />\nwhich \"inhabited\" her while she<br />\nwas learning the traditions of the<br />\nKoori people of Australia. Andrews is a woman with a Calling,<br />\nand she knows it.<br />\nShe tells the story of her experiences as part of the sisterhood<br />\nof the Shields, \"a sacred shaman<br />\nsociety of forty-four women<br />\nrepresenting the power of woman<br />\nfrom different indigenous<br />\ncultures around the world.\" Andrews describes shamanism as a<br />\n\"subtle and alchemical process<br />\ndesigned to transform and elevate<br />\nthe spirit beyond the constructs of<br />\nthe known limits of reality. It is<br />\nthe space program of the soul and<br />\nlaunches you out into the unchartered territory Or the stars. It<br />\nteaches you to experience the<br />\nwisdom of the Pleiades and the<br />\nuniverse, not just the physical<br />\nproperties of the planets.\"<br />\nOne could open the book to a<br />\nchance page and find something<br />\nlike the following statement from<br />\nAgnes Whistling Elk, who is a<br />\nMedicine woman from Canada<br />\nwho becomes Andrew's teacher.<br />\nWe see things because oflight. If<br />\nthere was no light then we would<br />\nsee nothing. Perhaps then nothing<br />\nwould exist. Perhaps then all<br />\nthere is is light.<br />\nFortunately for us simpletons,<br />\nthere is someone named Ruby,<br />\n<br />\nwho is also a mentor of Andrews', to dissent, \"I bump into<br />\nlots of things in the<br />\ndark. . . . Things exist in the<br />\ndark,\" while Andrews herself<br />\ncan only reply, \"Yes, I guess<br />\nso.\" Just as Andrews' response<br />\nto new arguments is acceptance,<br />\nher response to new experiences<br />\nis fear. She is indeed exemplary<br />\nof the Ordinary Person who has<br />\nbeen Chosen for a Mission, and<br />\nso invites her ordinary readers to<br />\nbelieve, appealing to them by virtue of her own disinclination to<br />\nbelieve, testified by her fear,<br />\nwhich has been transformed into<br />\nfaith. Why? Because she has<br />\ndiscovered the Truth.<br />\nThe story opens with a journey,<br />\na microcosm of the spiritual<br />\njourney to be unfolded in the rest<br />\nof the autobiography. Andrews<br />\nand Agnes Whistling Elk, to<br />\nwhom she is an apprentice, are<br />\ndriving into the remote<br />\nwilderness of Australia for a convention of shaman women who<br />\nwould share their knowledge<br />\namong themselves and their apprentices. Her descriptions are<br />\nquite vivid, and she often uses<br />\nlanguage that engages the mind<br />\nand draws the reader into her<br />\nnatural world. Still, no series of<br />\nmetaphors can serve her when<br />\nshe wishes to describe her contacts with supernatural forces.<br />\nWhen she tries to do this, her<br />\nstory becomes unbelievable. It is<br />\nnot the legitimacy of her experiences that is in question, nor<br />\nher sincerity in wanting to convey her message. After all, she<br />\nstates the cause of the problem<br />\n(indeed, of all problems), as \"the<br />\nimbalance between male and<br />\nfemale energies that is disrupting<br />\nthe world.\" The Sisterhood, as<br />\none might guess, is for Women<br />\nOnly, because men cannot be<br />\ntrusted. In any case, this is a problem which has been identified<br />\nfrom ancient times as fundamental in the natural world: it is the<br />\nbalance of yin and yang. So it is<br />\nno great surprise that this woman<br />\nshould discover it for herself and<br />\nfeel evangelical about it. But it is<br />\n<br />\nthe way with spiritual experiences<br />\nthat one must discover them by<br />\nones self. Andrews begins to<br />\nrealize this when she writes in her<br />\nintroduction that, \"To write adequately about shamanism, one has<br />\nto become a shaman.\" She only<br />\nmust see that logical conclusion<br />\nof the statement would prevent<br />\nher from even trying to make someone, who had not had her experiences, understand them.<br />\nThe format of her book does<br />\nnot help, either. If most spiritual<br />\nexperiences remain uncommunicated, the ones that do are<br />\nusually not presented for mass<br />\nconsumption. Resisting the temptation to note that this book is<br />\npublished by Warner Books, let<br />\nus just go on to look within the<br />\ncover (which, by the way, is<br />\nreminiscent of the \"flashing<br />\neyes\" and \"floating hair\" of Coleridge). Each chapter of average<br />\nlength eight pages is introduced<br />\nby a quote which one guesses<br />\nshould be thought-provoking, and<br />\na<br />\nfull-page<br />\nillustration,<br />\npresumably to express those images that are beyond words.<br />\nFinally, there are large chapter<br />\ntitles, complete with diamondshape designs, which seem to<br />\nhave a desire to arrest ones attention and cat,se one to say,\"Wow,<br />\nthat's deep.\" It is difficult not to<br />\nbe reminded of the National<br />\nEnquirer.<br />\nAndrews does go on to fulfill<br />\nher Personal Mission, to rectify<br />\nan injustice in the world in which<br />\nthe Powers are unbalanced, the<br />\nusual superhero story. In saving<br />\nthe world, she realizes the reflection of cosmic balance in herself,<br />\nher own combination of male and<br />\nfemale forces which she must<br />\nutilize and of coupe keep in<br />\nbalance. Although it is an old<br />\ntheme, it is very true, and perhaps<br />\namong the most important lessons<br />\nof the cosmos. It is a lesson,<br />\nhowever, which must be learned<br />\nindividually and subtly, and it is<br />\nbecause of this that Andrew's effort, albeit sincere, is<br />\nunsuccessful.<br />\n<br />\n\f24/FEBRUARY 12, 1988<br />\n<br />\nScience<br />\n<br />\nCondoms: Preventing<br />\nSexually Transmitted Diseases<br />\nThe News-Letter is covering<br />\nthis topic and enclosing a condom<br />\nso as to heighten awareness about<br />\nSexually Transmitted Diseases.<br />\nThe News-Letter is not trying to<br />\nadvocate any sexual practices or<br />\nbeliefs.

Dr. Arnall<br />\nPatz, from the School of<br />\nMedicine, outlined the use of<br />\nlasers in opthalmology to a<br />\ncapacity crowd in the Garrett<br />\nRoom for February's Welch<br />\nlecture. Using films of the<br />\nview through surgeons'<br />\nophthalmoscopes during laser<br />\nsurgery, Dr. Patz discussed<br />\nthe application of laser<br />\ntechnology to the potentially<br />\nproblems<br />\nof<br />\nblinding<br />\nglaucoma,<br />\ndiabetic<br />\nretinopathy, Age-Related<br />\nMacular Degeneration, and to<br />\nthe problems after cataract<br />\nsurgery.<br />\nDr. Patz is a graduate of<br />\nEmory University School of<br />\nMedicine, and recipient of<br />\nnumerous honorary degrees<br />\nfrom such noted institutions as<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson<br />\nUniversity, and Emory<br />\nUniversity. He has published<br />\nover 240 books and articles,<br />\nand has been a member of the<br />\nHopkins faculty since 1955.<br />\nCurrently, he is the William<br />\nHoward Wilmer Professor and<br />\nDirector of Ophthalmology for<br />\nJHMI. Dr. Patz has received<br />\nmany awards, including the<br />\nhighly prestigious Lasker<br />\nAward.<br />\nThe lasers Dr. Patz and<br />\nothers use in the surgery was<br />\ndeveloped at Hopkins. Dr.<br />\nBob Flower, senior physicist<br />\nat the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory and Associate Professor of Ophthalmology, explained how a laser (Light<br />\nAmplification by Stimulated<br />\nEmission of Radiation) functions, and Dr. Patz explained<br />\n<br />\nthe particulars of the \"pingpong\" laser he uses.(A pingpong ball is used to measure<br />\nthe intensity of the light beam,<br />\nto an accuracy which Dr. Patz<br />\nsays exceeds that of $60,000<br />\nequipment.)<br />\nThe laser beam is transmitted to the eye through an optical fiber attached to a special<br />\ncontact lens. A drop of<br />\nanaesthetic to ease insertion of<br />\nthis lens is the only pain killer<br />\nrequired for any of the<br />\nprocedures.<br />\nGlaucoma results from a<br />\ndisruption in the normal circulation of fluid behind the<br />\niris. The excess fluid causes<br />\npressure that can lead to blindness. Traditionally, the<br />\nsurgeon used a scalpel to open<br />\nthe eye and drain the fluid. Patients were hospitalized for<br />\ntwo to four days. Now, patients visit their doctor's office<br />\nand undergo treatment for six<br />\nto seven minutes for each eye.<br />\nThe laser simply punches a<br />\nhole through the iris to allow<br />\nnormal circulation. Dr. Patz<br />\nstressed that \"Early detection<br />\nand early control is the<br />\nsecret.\"<br />\nWhen light is focused, some<br />\nof its energy is converted to<br />\nheat. Laser light, when focused thorugh the special contact<br />\nlens and the lens of the eye<br />\nitself, can burn the retina (the<br />\nsurface of light-receptor cells<br />\nat the back of the eye). A<br />\nburned retina may not sound<br />\nlike a medical breakthrough,<br />\nbut in the right hands, it can<br />\nbe an alternative to blindness.<br />\nThe retina, like all tissues of<br />\nthe body, must receive<br />\nnourishment through the blood<br />\nvessels. Some victims of<br />\ndiabetes develop diabetic<br />\nretinopathy, which can lead to<br />\nleakage of blood through<br />\nswollen (aneurysms) or<br />\n<br />\nhemorrhaged vessels. Blood in<br />\nthe jelly-like center of the eye<br />\ncan prevent light from falling<br />\non the retina. Victims of AgeRelated Macular Degeneration<br />\nhave a similar difficulty.<br />\nThrough the years, the retina<br />\ndeteriorates. When the tissue<br />\nitself is damaged, lasers cannot help. However, lasers are<br />\nable to 'weld' leaking vessels,<br />\nand in a few months, the excess fluid is reabsorbed.<br />\nVisual acuity returns to 20/20<br />\nwhen the fluid is gone.<br />\nThe laser is carefully aimed<br />\n(as Dr. Patz said, \"not to be<br />\ndone on a Monday morning<br />\nwith a shaky hand\") to avoid<br />\nhealthy major blood vessels by<br />\nonly 1/75 of an inch. The<br />\nastonishing films of the procedure showed that the sharpshooting of an experienced<br />\npractitioner can completely<br />\nstop the leaks and hemorrhages in 1000 or 1200 rapidfire bursts of light. As long as<br />\nthe most sensitive part of the<br />\nretina, the macula, is spared<br />\nfrom damage, the laser can accomplish \"complete resolution of the patient's abnormality,\" Dr. Patz said.<br />\nsome<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\nperipheral vision must be<br />\ndestroyed to save the macula,<br />\nwhich is responsible for<br />\nreading and most other types<br />\nof sight. Dr. Patz realizes the<br />\nlimitations of this procedure.<br />\nHe does not term this treatment as a cure, but as \"a<br />\nstopgap treatment for this<br />\ndecade. . . hopefully, we will<br />\nhave a biochemical treatment<br />\nto inhibit abnormal growth.\"<br />\nA final application for lasers<br />\nis after cataract surgery, which<br />\nis the removal of a haze on the<br />\nlens common in elderly people.

You might also<br />\nnotice great improvement since<br />\nthe start of the season, as the Blue<br />\nJays have come back to post a<br />\n10-11 record with a 5-3 mark in<br />\nthe MAC.

Not only did the Jays<br />\nfail to win their division, but once<br />\nagain they did not receive the<br />\nmuch-coveted Prince sports bags<br />\nawarded to the winners. (An incentive all in itself.) The team left<br />\nThursday afternoon, beginning a<br />\nweekend that would bring an<br />\neleven-hour road trip, a diet of<br />\nfast foocl, and competitive<br />\nsquash.<br />\nPlay began on Friday at the<br />\nPayne Whitney Gym where<br />\nHopkins tallied its third victory<br />\nthis year over hapless Haverford<br />\n7-0. Senior co-captain Lisa Roy<br />\nand junior Chris Emmick led the<br />\nway with 3-1 victories. Seniors<br />\nJulie Heaney and Marlene<br />\nSchwaeber, juniors Kathy Hart<br />\nand Alice Collins all won 3-0.<br />\nSenior In-hei Hahn lost to Diana<br />\nCurran but the Haverford player<br />\nwas ruled ineligible (a grad student) so the match was defaulted<br />\nin Hopkins' favor. Hopkins then<br />\nedged past a surprisingly solid<br />\nConnecticut College team 4-3.<br />\nLisa Roy won 13-16, 15-8,<br />\n18-15, 15-11, senior co-captian<br />\nDanya Niedzwiedzki lost 15-9,<br />\n6-15, 15-12, 16-13, and Chris<br />\nEmmick won 15-12, 15-12, 15-9.<br />\nJulie Heaney fell 3-2 by a 15-11,<br />\n12-15, 17-14, 4-15, 17-15 score<br />\nand Marlene Schwaeber rolled<br />\nover her opponent 15-2, 15-7,<br />\n15-7. Kathy Hart battled back to<br />\nwin 2-15, 15-8, 15-13, 15-11,<br />\nand Alice Collins fell 15-11,<br />\n<br />\n15-9, 15-11.<br />\nOn Saturday St. Lawrence failed to show up and forfeited their<br />\nmatch. That afternoon the Jays<br />\nsqueaked by Wesleyan 4-3. Lisa<br />\nRoy won 3-2, 14-17, 15-7, 15-6,<br />\n11-15, 17-14; Danya Niedzweidzki lost 15-4, 15-7, 15-12; and<br />\nthird-seeded Chris Emmick slipped 11-15, 15-6, 15-11, 15-8.<br />\nJulie Heaney jammed 15-4, 15-5,<br />\n6-15, 15-4; and Marlene<br />\nSchwaeber won 11-15, 15-9,<br />\n15-8, 15-12. Kathy Hart lost<br />\n18-16, 15-9, 15-4, and In-hei<br />\nHahn won 15-6, 12-15, 15-8,<br />\n15-13.<br />\nHowever, the Sunday matches<br />\ntested the mettle and the determination of the Jays. Bates gave<br />\nHopkins a lot of trouble and rattled the Jays 5-2. Hopkins did not<br />\nroll over and die though, pushing<br />\nall of the lost matches to five<br />\ngames and forcing a plethora of<br />\ntie-breakers. Lisa Roy won 15-9,<br />\n17-14, 15-9; while Danya Niedzwiedzki was defeated 4-15.<br />\n13-15, 15-10, 15-10, 16-15.<br />\nChris Emmick stumbled 14-16,<br />\n17-14, 15-11, 9-15, 18-15; and<br />\nJulie Heaney also lost 10-15,<br />\n15-10, 15-16, 15-9, 18-15.<br />\nMarlene Schwaeber, who played<br />\nsome excellent squash that<br />\nweekend, won 18-14, 11-15,<br />\n15-8, 15-9. Kathy Hart was stopped 15-11, 6-15, 15-12, 9-15,<br />\n18-15; and sophomore Kathryn<br />\nNg was tripped up 9-15, 5-15,<br />\n16-13, 17-14, 15-7.<br />\nThe final match was against<br />\nSmith College, normally ranked<br />\nin Division II. The only winner<br />\nwas 7th ranked In-hei Hahn<br />\n13-15, 15-12, 15-11, 15-13, as<br />\n<br />\nthe Jays were shredded 1-6. Lisa<br />\nRoy lost 15-8, 16-15, 15-3, and<br />\nDanya Niedzwiedzki got singed<br />\n15-2, 15-11, 15-3. Chris Emmick<br />\nlost 15-7. 15-7, 15-6, and Julie<br />\nHeaney lost 15-10, 15-10, 15-13.<br />\nMarlene Schwaeber posted a<br />\n8-15, 15-12, 15-14, 15-8 loss,<br />\nand Kathy Hart lost 15-13, 15-8,<br />\n15-5. Although Hopkins was 4-2<br />\nfor the weekend, they came in a<br />\ndisappointing fourth because<br />\n<br />\nranking was ultimately decided<br />\nby the number of individual matches won. The trip was worthwhile, however, not only from<br />\nthe experience gained but in the<br />\neducation received. The Division<br />\nI matchups between the numberone players of Harvard, Yale,<br />\nPrinceton, and Franklin & Marshall were \"incredible to watch.\"<br />\nThe power, speed, control, and<br />\nfinesse displayed by those players<br />\n<br />\nsurely earmarked them as the best<br />\nin college squash.<br />\nToday, the Jays will be pitting<br />\nthemselves against Cornell at<br />\nPhiladelphia and then face the<br />\nPenn Round Robin on Saturday to<br />\nclose out the season.

One was by bowing out<br />\nwith grace and dignity. Ted<br />\nWilliams may be the most prominent example of a player who left<br />\nthe game while still on top. Having been humbled by a sub-par<br />\n.254 season in 1959, the Splendid Splinter rebounded in his<br />\nfarewell season of 1960 by hitting<br />\n.316 and slamming 29 homers in<br />\nonly 310 at-bats.

Tom<br />\nboth their legend and the respect Seaver, one of the greatest pitthey once commanded. Everyone chers of our or any other generation, disappeared from the major<br />\nleague scene without so much as<br />\na farewell performance. And it's<br />\nnot as if his fans everywhere<br />\nshould have expected his sudden<br />\ndeparture; on the contrary, he<br />\n<br />\nwas still doing very well, thank<br />\nyou. Granted, his 1986 record of<br />\n7-13 is pretty bad, but you must<br />\nunderstand that Tom received<br />\nfewer runs of support than any of<br />\nhis fellow rotation mates that<br />\nyear. That includes his White Sox<br />\nteammates as well as his last<br />\nteammates, the men from the<br />\nLegion of Doom. Tom's ERA<br />\nwas better than the league<br />\naverage, and he received tremendous credit for stabilizing the Red<br />\nSox rotation in the time that Red<br />\nSox fortunes began to collapse<br />\nwholesale. All in all, not a bad<br />\nyear.<br />\nAfter the 1986 season, though,<br />\nthe Red Sox management chose<br />\nto ignore all that, chose to ignore<br />\nthe fact that they were desperate<br />\nfor pitchers, chose above all to ignore the fact that they had in their<br />\nmidst a living legend who was<br />\nstill producing, and refused to<br />\n<br />\nbring Tom Terrific back. It made<br />\nfor a curious finish to a dazzling<br />\ncareer. I truly believe that the<br />\nman who penned the words,<br />\n\"Not a finish worthy of the<br />\nstart,\" must have certainly had<br />\nTom in mind.

Fortsch<br />\nThe difference between meal plan rates<br />\nand the individual meal rates charged at the<br />\nTerrace Room is wide enough to assure<br />\nthat virtually all students who subscribe to<br />\na meal plan would save money by buying<br />\nmeals individually.<br />\nNevertheless, Bettye Miller, director of<br />\nAuxiliary Enterprises, and Kevin Finnegan, director of dining services for<br />\nSeiler's Enterprises, which provides food<br />\nfor the cafeterias at Homewood, believe<br />\nthat such a comparison is irrelevant<br />\nbecause the meal plan and casual rates cannot be compared.<br />\nIn two articles published in November,<br />\n1985, the News-Letter found that many<br />\nstudents who subscribe to meal plans actually spend more money to be on the plan<br />\nthan they would if they were to buy meals<br />\nindividually.<br /><br />\nAll students living on campus must purchase a fourteen or nineteen meal plan.<br />\nFreshmen living off campus must also<br />\nchoose one of these plans. Upperclassmen<br />\nliving off campus may choose a ten meal<br />\nplan, but are not required to purchase any<br />\nplan. Students may also switch plans in the<br />\nmiddle of the academic year.<br />\nUsing the current meal plan and casual<br />\nrates as bases, a student subscribing to a<br />\nmeal plan would have to eat between 99.1<br />\nand 172.8 percent of the meals available<br />\nto him to save money.<br />\nThe percentage reflect those for a meal<br />\nplan participant who eats meals in the Terrace Room in such a way that the average<br />\ncost for these meals, based on casual rates,<br />\nis roughly $3.60, the approximate average<br />\ncost of a casual meal in the Terrace Room.<br />\nIf a meal plan participant were to eat the<br />\nmost expensive meals available to him, the<br />\npercentages would be 99.1 to 152.0 per-<br /><br />\ncent. If a participant were to miss at least<br />\none meal at any time, his percentages<br />\nwould be higher.<br />\nAuxiliary Enterprises oversees and<br />\nchecks the quality of services of such campus institutions as the bank, bookstore, and<br />\ncafeterias, while Seiler's is a Universityhired contractor that has operated the<br />\ncafeterias since 1986.<br />\nAs a result of the disparity between meal<br />\nplan and casual rates, said Miller, some<br />\nstudents may believe that meal plan participants pay too much to be on the meal<br />\nplan.<br />\nShe said that such an assumption is a frequent misconception. Casual rates, which<br />\nare intended for the occasional guests at<br />\nthe Terrace Room, are $2.50 for a<br />\nbreakfast, $3.50 for a lunch or brunch,<br />\n$4.50 for a dinner, and $5 for a premium<br />\nSee FOOD,6<br /><br />\nboth the Deans of the SChoo<br />\n-1 -Of<br />\nArts and Sciences and<br />\nEngineering.<br />\n\"The office will report to the<br />\ntwo [Homewood] academic<br />\ndeans, whatever that office may<br />\nbe,\" said Lombardi.<br />\nIn the present administrative<br />\nstructure, Welch reports directly<br />\nto Lombardi and the two<br />\nacademic deans.

The American<br />\ngovernment and agencies such as<br />\nthe CIA were \"afraid that communist powers would take over<br />\nand seize the electorate\" of<br />\nseveral less-powerful countries.<br />\nLichenstein attributed interventionist policies of the United<br />\nStates as well as activism during<br />\nthe 1950s as being primarily<br />\nassociated with the policy of containment, an attempt to stop the<br />\nspread of communism.

So why can't we get a<br />\nlittle help around here?<br />\nIn past issues of the News-Letter we have published half-page appeals, both humorous and serious, and the response has been less than<br />\nideal.

Does Erik Harrell believe<br />\nhis vendetta against Lee<br />\nDranikoff aids our understanding<br />\nof Palestinian rioting, and more<br />\nimportantly, does he care? Harrell implies that anyone concerned with the defense of Israel is<br />\nreactionary or, in his terms, a<br />\n\"Kahane.\" This fallacy is akin to<br />\ncalling every Palestinian an Abu<br />\nNidal or Yasser Arafat\u2014people<br />\nwho, much to Harrell's chagrin,<br />\nnot even all Palestinians emulate.<br />\nHarrell also chooses to ignore<br />\nthe number of moderate Arabs,<br />\nwho because they did not share<br />\nthe dream of the eradication of<br />\nIsreal, were killed by their fellow<br />\nArabs. Anwar Sadat was but the<br />\nmost prominent example. When<br />\nHarrell speaks of conditions in<br />\nGaza, he deliberately ignores that<br />\nit is Palestinians, not Israelis, who<br />\nare starving their own brothers<br />\nand sisters by denying them access, through intimidation tactics<br />\nand other violent forms of coercion, to their places of<br />\nemployments and to markets to<br />\npurchase food.<br />\nA similar situation prevails in<br />\nJudea and Samaria, where some<br />\nArabs live in villas paid for with<br />\nfunds \"procured\" from UNRWA projects to provide food and<br />\nhousing, while others continue to<br />\nlanguish in refugee camps. Harrell also ignores the fate of<br />\nPalestinian Arabs suffered at the<br />\nhands of their Shi'i Amal brothers<br />\nin Lebanon, as well as the<br />\n\"hospitality\" which King Hus-<br /><br />\nsein showed these Arabs in<br />\nSeptember, 1970.<br />\nThis does not mean that the<br />\nIsraelis have welcomed an Arab<br />\npresence in Israel, for this is not<br />\nthe case. But until the Palestinian<br />\n\"people\" stop being just another<br />\nweapon in the arsenal of the Arab<br />\nworld, we cannot reasonably call<br />\nthem victims or expect their situation to improve. When the goal<br />\nof the Arabs stops being Tel<br />\nAviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, then<br />\nit will be more realistic to discuss<br />\nthe future of Gaza, Judea, and<br />\nSamaria. Until that time, violence<br />\nwill continue to plague the Holy<br />\nLand.<br />\nRon D. Abrams<br /><br />\nVisitor's View<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nits superior military to step on the<br />\nPalestinian revolt. Dranikoffs<br />\nview obscures the reality of the<br />\nsituation. The Palestinian uprising is a popular, grass-roots<br />\nmovement. These people are not<br />\nintent on threatening Israel's right<br />\nto exist. Rather, like Americans,<br />\nPalestinians share our aspirations<br />\nto make a decent living, educate<br />\ntheir children and own a house.<br />\nHowever, future prosperity and<br />\nthus political moderation among<br />\nPalestininans is thwarted by<br />\nrestrictions on the economic<br />\nrights of Palestinians imposed by<br />\nIsraeli military occupation. They<br />\nhave few political rights and as an<br />\n\"occupied\" people, the Palestinians have little control over their<br />\nown destiny. They are at the<br />\nwhim of Israel, the PLO, and the<br />\nArab countries and the superpowers. It is a condition of<br />\npowerlessness. The events of the<br />\npast few months are an expression of Palestinian frustration<br />\nwith their situation.<br />\nAs Americans, we value and<br />\nespouse freedom, liberty, equality, human rights and democracy.<br />\nThese values and rights as<br />\nAmericans we cherish and champion throughout the world are<br />\nwhat the Palestinians are fighting<br />\nfor. Why should Israel control<br />\nterritories in which the Palestinians are the overwhelming majority? Is Israel's presence in the<br />\noccupied lands legitimate when it<br />\nhas to kill children, beat civillians<br />\nand strip Palestinians of basic<br />\nhuman rights to maintain control<br />\nover the territories?<br />\nWe as Americans should<br />\nseriously consider the events in<br />\nthe occupied territories, particularly Israeli methodology. We<br />\nmust remember that Palestinians<br />\nare being intimidated and killed<br />\nby American-made and supplied<br />\nweapons because they demand<br />\npolitical autonomy and control<br />\nover their destiny. We must also<br />\nconsider that the occupation of<br />\nthe West Bank and Gaza is being<br />\nfinanced by Americans through<br />\nboth government and private<br />\nsources.

When Miss<br />\nWhite was unable to book Naked<br />\nPrey into her original choice of<br />\nvenue, she decided, on a recommendation from the Sub-Mensas,<br />\nto book into Chester's Place, also<br />\nknown as The Little Theater.<br />\nAlthough Miss White may regret<br />\nher decision, given the poor turnout by Hopkins students, the<br />\nHopkins music scene definitely<br />\nbenefited from the decision.<br />\nThe Sub-Mensas performed<br />\nfirst, to a crowd that consisted of<br />\nmore band members and friends<br />\nthan anything else. Two Hopkins<br />\nstudents were in attendance,<br />\ncounting myself. As the Mensas<br />\ntuned up and prepared to start, I<br />\nbraced myself for the worst.<br />\nLocal rumor had it that these guys<br />\nwere pretty bad, and my fears<br />\nwere only intensified by the<br />\nsomewhat vacant state of lead<br />\nsinger Damon (real name: Louis)<br />\nNorko, which I siispect had<br />\nsomething to do with the brown<br />\nbag from which he kept taking<br />\npulls. As they started into their<br /><br />\nfirst song, my fears were both<br />\nconfirmed and refuted. Mr.<br />\nNorko is of the Jello Biafra<br />\nCalifornia Hardcore Screamer<br />\nSchool of Vocalists, meaning that<br />\neverything that comes out of his<br />\nmouth is meant to sound like an<br />\naccusation or a pure statement of<br />\noutrage, and this, coupled with<br />\ngenerally mean-spirited, cynicalpunk lyrics, makes him sound<br />\nlike every hardcore front man to<br />\ncome down the pike since 1978.<br />\nThis is not so much bad as boring, and Mr. Norko's epileptic<br />\nthrashings on stage do nothing to<br />\nmake his performance any more<br />\ninteresting. The rest of the band,<br />\nhowever, is possessed of some<br />\npretty decent chops. The bass and<br />\ndrums quickly locked into a<br />\ngroove that was funky enough to<br />\nbe danceable, but simple enough<br />\nthat it didn't get in the way of the<br />\nguitar work. The rhythm and lead<br />\nguitars worked together to produce a sound that was rather<br />\nreminiscent of Led Zep, with the<br />\nrhythm creating a storm of fuzz<br />\nover which could be heard the ,<br />\nchiming voice of the lead like a<br />\ncry from the void. The SubMensas will be performing at<br />\nChester's again later this month,<br />\nso you should check them out for<br />\nyourselves.<br />\nAny standards for the evening<br />\nthat might have been set by the<br />\nSub-Mensas were quickly blown<br />\naway by Baltec, a three-piece<br />\nfrom Washington. Here is a<br />\ngroup that could melt steel with<br />\ntheir intensity, and comparisons<br /><br />\nto The Who, Sonic Youth, and<br />\nThe Replacements immediately<br />\ncome to mind. Drummer Sam<br />\nParker attacked his kit with such<br />\nferocity that the kick drum kept<br />\nscooting across the floor, and, at<br />\none point, the whole kit collapsed in the middle of a song. Mr.<br />\nParker, however, continued playing with whatever he had left,<br />\nbanging away at whatever would<br />\nstand the onslaught. For the first<br />\ntime in my life I thought I was actually going to see some drumheads destroyed, and I kept thinking 'Here's our answer to Keith<br />\nMoon.' Guitarist and lead<br />\nvocalist Bill Kite stuck to a heavymetal style guitar attack played<br />\nfast and low on the neck, yet Mr.<br />\nKite also displayed a versatility<br />\nthat kept the songs from becoming predictable. There was<br />\nsomething almost sexual in the<br />\nway he kept ramming his guitar<br />\nup against the stacks, trying to get<br />\nthem to feed back. Behind all this,<br />\nbassist David Nine managed to<br />\npound out a simple (and that is not<br />\nmeant as a cut) bass line that<br />\nhelped keep everything more or<br />\nless together. \"Houseboat,\" their<br />\nfinal song, turned into a wellcontrolled thrash fest, with both<br />\nMr. Kite and Mr. Nine on the<br />\nfloor in front of the drums pounding on their instruments. When<br />\nthe smoke finally cleared, I<br />\ndiscovered that I'd been holding<br />\nmy breath through most of the<br />\nsong. This, ladies and and<br />\ngentlemen, is what rock and roll<br />\nis all about. Get these men a<br /><br />\nrecording contract!<br />\nAlthough a hard act to follow,<br />\nThe Bags provided as much of a<br />\ngood time as Baltec, although in<br />\na slightly different way\u2014they're<br />\nthe biggest hams I've ever seen.<br />\nUnlike Angst, whom they'd<br />\nopened for the night before, these<br />\nguys do scissor-kick their way<br />\nthrough a tour. They also belch,<br />\neat microphones, get beer poured<br />\non their head (with a little help<br />\nfrom the guys in Baltec), and<br />\ngenerally engage in raucous<br />\nbehavior. These guys have fun on<br />\nstage, and it carries over into the<br />\naudience. I was having such a<br />\ngood time I didn't even mind it<br />\nwhen they trashed U2's \"I Will<br />\nFollow\"\u2014probably the best<br />\ncover of that song I've ever<br />\nheard. Musically, they're<br />\nsomewhat less than inspired,<br />\ncoming off sounding a lot like a<br />\nthree-piece version of the<br />\nRamones, but this should not be<br />\ninterpreted as a major fault.<br />\nWhen these guys get down to the<br />\nmusic, its quite clear that they're<br />\ndeadly serious about what they're<br />\ndoing, and they attack each song<br />\nwith an absolute relentlessness. In<br />\nfact, my only real criticism is that<br />\nthey should be a little less<br />\nrelentless and throw us an occassional change-up, if for no other<br />\nreason than to give the other stuff<br />\nmore impact. That they have the<br />\nversatility to do this was aptly<br />\ndemonstrated by their skill at<br />\ncovering other people's songs,<br />\nand their drummer's ability to imitate any drummer named. For<br /><br />\nanybody who might be interested,<br />\nthese guys have an album out on<br />\nRestless Records, a division of<br />\nEnigma Records.<br />\nWhen Naked Prey. the<br />\nheadliners, finally made it to the<br />\nstage at 12:45, they had a halfhour to play, and an audience of<br />\nsix. Much to their credit, they still<br />\nplayed every song for what it was<br />\nworth, barreling through each<br />\none like a runaway locomotive,<br />\nwith only enough of a pause between songs for front-man Van<br />\nChristian to call out the next one.<br />\nNaked Prey play a hard-boiled<br />\nWestern Blues, the kind of music<br />\nthat sounds like they've drank too<br />\nmany whiskeys alone in cheap<br />\ndive-bars, spent too many nights<br />\ncrossing the desert in an old pickup, and generally seen too much<br />\nof life at the edge in the American<br />\nWest. When these guys perform<br />\na song, you don't just hear it, you<br />\nfeel it, because they're playing as<br />\nmuch for themselves as for you.<br />\nYeah, Van Christian, I can feel<br />\nit, and that's also what rock and<br />\nroll is all about.<br />\nWhen the night finally ended,<br />\nI went downstairs to leave, only<br />\nto see most of the band members<br />\ngathered around the TV watching<br />\na Hammer Horror film. They<br />\nwere heavy-lidded and slackjawed, all fagged out from performing. I wanted to say<br />\nsomething about having put on<br />\nsuch a great show, but I figured<br />\nI'd let them zone out in peace.<br />\nHell, they'd all certainly earned<br />\nit.<br /><br />\nParadise Lost: Timely or out of date?<br />\nby Amy Reiter<br />\nThis month CenterStage is doing what most repertory theaters<br />\ndo not. They are producing a play<br />\nby Clifford Odets. Why do most<br />\ntheaters pass over Odet's work?<br />\nBecause it tends to be didactic,<br />\nout-of-date, and difficult to<br />\nwatch. Why is CenterStage producing Odets' Paradise Lost<br />\nanyway? Because they feel that it<br />\nhas an important and timely<br />\nmessage. Who is right?<br />\nParadise Lost charts the demise<br />\nof the American middle class<br />\nfamily as a result of the Great<br />\nDepression. The play begins in<br />\nthe Fall of 1932 when the Katz<br /><br />\nfamily is just beginning to feel the<br />\neffects of the Depression. They<br />\nare forced to modify their comfortable lifestyle, foregoing such<br />\nluxuries as a maid and a<br />\ncanary\u2014domestic help and<br />\ndomesticated animals. As the play<br />\ncontinues, the family business<br />\nsinks lower and lower until, in the<br />\nSpring of 1935, it finally goes<br />\nunder completely. The family is<br />\nbeing sucked into a sea of debts,<br />\nillness, desperation, and death.<br />\nThe only lifesaver Odets throws<br />\nthem comes in the form of<br />\nsocialist rhetoric that seems to imply that their ability to survive<br />\ncomes not from what they have,<br />\nbut from what they believe.<br /><br />\nOdets wrote the play in 1935<br />\nwhen the message certainly was<br />\ntimely. The actors and the audience at his experimental Group<br />\nTheatre in New York were struggling for survival themselves.<br />\nThey needed someone to speak<br />\nfrom them and for them. Odets<br />\nserved as a spokesperson for his<br />\ntime. He represented the lower<br />\nand middle classes and attempted<br />\nto impress upon them the need to<br />\nkeep fighting the social undertow.<br />\nAs a result, Odets' plays often<br />\nsurrender the realistic characters,<br />\nsetting and story to serve his<br />\nidealistic purpose. Such is the case<br />\nwith Paradise Lost. The first two<br />\nacts set up a Compelling story<br /><br />\nCharles Dumas, Stan Lachow, and Martin Rudy star in Paradise Lost at the Center Stage here in Baltimore<br /><br />\nabout a Jewish middle class family in dire economic trouble. His<br />\ndialogue is clean, crisp and<br />\nauthentic. We believe in his<br />\ncharacters as people.<br />\nIn the third act, however,<br />\nthings change. All of a sudden,<br />\nevery character becomes a symbol. Julie (Rudy Goldschmidt),<br />\nthe youngest son dying of \"the<br />\nsleeping sickness,\" quotes the<br />\nstock market statistics in his<br />\ndelirium. \"Oh,\" we exclaim. \"I<br />\nget it. He represents the stock<br />\nmarket. He kept moving in the<br />\nlast two scenes and now he's<br />\ncomatose. And when he tried on<br />\nthe tuxedo 'to make himself feel<br />\nbetter' it was like the false optimism of the market before it<br />\ncrashed.\"<br />\nPearl(Amy Griscom Epstein),<br />\nthe piano playing daughter who<br />\nspends most of her time in her<br />\nown musical world, is Odets'jab<br />\nat the arts. She is selfish,<br />\negotistical and indifferent to the<br />\nsuffering around her. \"Her piano<br />\nplaying is her life,\" the mother<br />\nobserves. Mr. Pike (Charles<br />\nDumas), the furnace man, is the<br />\nangry lower class. Leo (Stan<br />\nLachow), the father, is the blind<br />\noptimist.<br />\nAs we go through this mental<br />\nsymbolic checklist, the play loses<br />\nsome of its human-to-human appeal. The characters seem much<br />\nless like real people. As the play<br />\nconcludes we realize that the<br />\nstage is a soapbox and the words<br />\nare not dialogue but socialist<br />\ndogma. We have<br />\nbeen<br />\nmanipulated.<br /><br />\nOdets was a clever man. He<br />\nwanted to manipulate his audience back in 1935, to shake<br />\nthem out of their complacency<br />\nwhich, to him, was tantamount to<br />\ndeath. The audience may even<br />\nhave wanted to be manipulated.<br />\nThat is why his plays have gone<br />\ndown in history as masterpieces<br />\nof their time.<br />\nNowadays, the plays go unproduced, unperformed. Propaganda does not weather well.<br />\nMessages which may have seemed desperate and justifiable in the<br />\n1930's seem empty and useless<br />\ntoday. After Black October it is<br />\neasy to understand how<br />\nCenterStage saw a connection<br />\nbetween the 1930's and the<br />\n1980's. It is not Odets' message<br />\nthat is obsolete; it is his agit-prop<br />\nstyle. He's too confrontational,<br />\nnot subtle enough for modern audiences. We can hear speeches on<br />\ntelevision about the sad state of<br />\nthe economy. In the theater we<br />\nexpect the message to come in a<br />\nstory, like a coated pill. Odets<br />\nstory melts away at the end,<br />\nrendering the message hard to<br />\nswallow.<br />\nThe CenterStage approached<br />\nthis play with thought and sensitivity. Anna Berger is perfect in<br />\nher role as the mamma, Clara<br />\nGordon. Each member of this<br />\ntwenty-four member cast adds<br />\nsomething to the whole. Unfortunately, even this tender production cannot save the audience<br />\nfrom Odets' stale anger. Odets<br />\nshakes his fist; we shrug our<br />\nshoulders.<br /><br />\n20/FEBRUARY 12 1988<br /><br />\nThe Flip Side by Phil Gochenour EArt tilcinclii<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\nLast<br />\nweek, you<br />\nmay<br />\nremember, I started off discussing some new British groups like<br />\nSkinny Puppy, The Sisters of<br />\nMercy, and The Young Gods.<br />\nWe pick the theme again this<br />\nweek, starting with Benny Profane and their import EP Devil<br />\nLaughing. Now, I said to myself,<br />\nany group that names itself after<br />\none of the main characters in<br />\nThomas Pynchon's V has got to<br />\nbe interesting. Sadly enough,<br />\nthere are no Pynchon references<br />\nhere, not even a damned kazoo.<br />\nOne should not be disappointed<br />\ntoo much by this fact, however,<br />\nsince you do manage to get some<br />\ncool music in the deal. Benny<br />\nProfane sounds a bit like a<br />\ncleaned-up version of The Jesus<br />\nand Mary Chain wired on coke.<br />\nThey're moody (isn't anybody<br />\nover there happy?), and yet<br />\nsomehow possessed of a vigorous<br />\nvitality. This vitality is a function<br />\nof Dave Jackson's acrobatic tenor<br />\nvocals (I'm guessing who does<br />\nwhat, since the album cover<br />\ndoesn't say), a bright,jangly lead<br />\nguitar, and a rhythm section that<br />\nkeeps things moving nicely<br />\nwithout resorting to a dance-hall<br />\nstomp beat. And though this<br />\ndescription might make them<br />\nsound a bit like The Smiths,<br />\nthey're post-punk enough to incorporate some stinging feedback<br />\ninto \"Beam Me Up,\" a song<br /><br />\nabout a man being driven to<br />\nmurder by junk food (I think),<br />\nand put some fast tempos and genuine anger into songs like<br />\n\"Stitch That\" and \"Credulous as<br />\nHell.\" This is good music with<br />\nwit, feeling, and some nice<br />\nmusical chops, and I reccommend<br />\nit without reservation. And, if<br />\nyou happen to find a whole album<br />\nby these guys, could I borrow it<br />\nfrom you?<br />\nRick Astley is new to our<br />\nshores, and RCA was kind<br />\nenough to send me a copy of his<br />\nlatest album Whenever You Need<br />\nSomebody. Hmm, Linn drums,<br />\nmulti-tracked vocals recorded on<br />\nCalred Soundfield Microphones,<br />\nFairlight effects .. . in other<br />\nwords, the most fun you can have<br />\nwith this album is trying to figure<br />\nout all the production techniques<br />\nthat went into it. This is not surprising, since it is a Stock, Aitken<br />\nand Waterman production. They<br />\nwrote five of the songs (Astley<br />\nwrote four), played the guitars<br />\nand keyboards, and even put \"A<br />\nStock Aitken Waterman Production\" under Astley's picture on<br />\nthe back. After reading this guy's<br />\nbio, it becomes perfectly clear<br />\nthat this was just some guy SAW<br />\npicked out to be the pretty face<br />\nthat would sell their songs and<br />\nmake them a lot of money. This<br />\nmight sound cynical, but these are<br />\nthe guys who said that all popsongs were basically a disposable<br />\nproduct, an attitude which might<br /><br />\nbe expected from a group of producers who sound like a law firm.<br />\nBasically, these guys have a stock<br />\nmid-eighties dance-hall sound<br />\nwhich they put behind whatever<br />\nface they can dig up. In this case,<br />\nit's a shame they decided to pick<br />\non this poor kid, since he does<br />\nhave a lot of vocal talent.<br />\nAnybody who has the balls to<br />\ncover Nat King Cole, and pull it<br />\noff, is one hell of a talented<br />\nvocalist, and deserves better<br />\ntreatment than this. Unfortunately, he's already been compared to<br />\nfellow Welshman Tom Jones,<br />\nwhich has him marked as being<br />\nterminally unhip, and therefore<br />\ndoomed his career. Oh, what a<br />\ncruel mistress the music biz is.<br />\nI'm filled with such a sense of<br />\nmoral outrage I can't even go on.<br />\nMaybe I'll be back next week, if<br />\nI once again feel strong enough<br />\nto wallow in the mire that we call<br />\nthe music industry.<br /><br />\nFILM<br /><br />\nART<br /><br />\nFor all you romantics, Weekend Wonder Flix presents The<br />\nLady and the Tramp. \"When the<br />\nmoon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore \"Friday<br />\nand Saturday at 8:00 and 10:15<br />\nin Shriverl.<br />\nFor those of you terminally<br />\ndepressed about Valentine's Day,<br />\nthe Reel World presents Red<br />\nDesert, the story of an alientated<br />\nand acutely depressed woman in<br />\nurban society.

The \"Sparkplug\" bobbled the ball, though, and the \"Rat\" made it to<br />\nfirst safely. The Giant's bench roared its<br />\napproval.<br />\nNext up was \"Four Eyes,\" who was able to<br />\nsafely advance the \"Rat\" while getting to first<br />\nbase himself. After \"Four Eyes,\" Tommy<br />\n\"Liberty\" Bell was able to get a clean hit,<br />\nloading the bases, putting the tying runs on<br />\nbase and the winning run at the plate. The<br />\nGiant's batter was the \"Mud Foot,\" and he<br />\nknew that all he had to do was get a solid hit,<br />\nto keep from hitting into a double play, to keep<br />\nthe Giant's only drive of the game alive.\"Mud<br />\nFoot\" watched the first two pitches go by<br />\nwithout taking cuts, and both were called<br />\nstrikes.\"Mud Foot\" looked over his shoulder<br />\nat the Giant's bench, which had become suddenly quiet. \"Clean hit, 'Mud Foot' \" said<br />\nCoach Henson. \"Just a clean hit.\"<br />\n\"Mud Foot\" took a moment to position<br />\nhimself in the batter's box. He dug his back<br />\nfoot into the soft dirt so he could place all of<br />\nhis weight into his swing, and pulled that bat<br />\nup onto his shoulder and waited for the pitch.<br />\nAgain, he watched the pitch go by, a ball. And<br />\nhe watched the next one go by for ball two.<br />\nFinally, with the count at two and two,\"Mud<br />\nFoot\" unloaded. The ball soared high into the<br />\nafternoon air, the bench erupted in wild<br />\ncheers, and \"Mud Foot\" took a moment to<br />\nwatch the ball and appreciate his work before<br />\nhe began his slugger's trot. The Giants all<br />\ngathered around home plate to greet \"Mud<br />\nFoot\" as he loped in for the winning run.<br />\n\"Way to go, 'Mud Foot!'\" roared Coach<br />\nHenson. \"How does it feel to be a hero?\"<br />\n\"I'll tell you in a second, Coach,\" said \"Mud<br />\nFoot\" as he made his way through the crowd<br />\ntowards the woods. \"I got to do something<br />\nfirst.\"<br />\nCoach Henson nodded in approval. \"Take<br />\nyour time,'Mud Foot', take your time.\"<br /><br />\nby Andy Gray<br />\nMr. Henson wasn't a very large man. He<br />\ndidn't even look particularly athletic. But to<br />\nthe fourteen six year olds on the Wamsutter<br />\nGiants, the Cap-League baseball team that he<br />\ncoached, he was Willie Mays, Babe Ruth, and<br />\nWillie Stargell all wrapped into one. And<br />\nabove all, he was fair; instead of playing the<br />\ntraditional none players on the field, Mr. Henson had all fourteen of his kids take to the field<br />\nfor defense, cluttering up the infield where<br />\nfour young boys all said they were the<br />\nshortstop\u2014two between first base and second,<br />\nand two more between second base and third.<br />\nNever mind that only one of them was right;<br />\nthey were all convinced that they were playing shortstop, and that's all that mattered to<br />\nMr. Henson.<br />\nIn one particular game, the game that this<br />\nstory is concerned with, the Wamsutter Giants<br />\nwere playing the Winnemucca Indians, and,<br />\nunfortunately, the Indians were getting the<br />\nbetter of the Giants. The Tribe's onslaught<br />\nbegan in the very first inning. There was one<br />\nman on base and two outs when famed Indian<br />\npower hitter Billy \"Loost Tooth\" Collins nailed a ball well into deep center field, which, by<br />\nthe way, is about twenty five feet beyond second base in the Cap-League. Giant's outfielder Doug \"Four Eyes\" Hathaway was in<br />\nposition under the ball.\"Doug,\" yelled Coach<br />\nHenson, \"Dougy, catch the ball!\" Unfortunately, the bit of coaching was enough to<br />\ndistract \"Four Eyes\" from his mission, and the<br />\nball hit him squarely on the head, sending<br />\nHathaway to the dirt as one of the Indians<br />\nscored and \"Loose Tooth\" got a stand up<br />\ndouble.<br />\nCoach Henson walked out to center field.<br />\nDoug was still sitting on the ground, legs crossed Indian style. \"Doug,\" he said,\"You've got<br />\nto keep your eye on the ball, okay,son?\" Doug<br />\nnodded and started to get up. \"All right, son,<br />\nnow let's play some ball!\"<br />\nThe score remained one to nothing until the<br />\ntop of the sixth, and in Cap League, final inning, when again, with one man on base, the<br />\nfeared \"Loose Tooth\" took the batter's box.<br />\n\"Loose Tooth\" unleashed another powerful<br />\ncrack of the bat, sending the ball into far left<br />\nfield. Coach Henson looked out to left field<br />\nfor his usually competent fielder, Ed \"Mud<br />\nFoot\" Murphy, but \"Mud Foot\" was strangely absent from his position, and the ball fell<br />\ninto left field and rolled so far that \"Loose<br />\nTooth\" was able to trot the bases leisurely,<br />\nspreading the Tribe's lead to three to naught.<br />\nJust as the Indians' slugger was finishing his<br />\nvictory trot, \"Mud Foot\" walked out of the<br />\nwoods that lined left field, pulling up the zipper on his trousers. Coach Henson took to the<br />\nfield again.<br />\n\"Hey, Mud Foot, where were you?\" said<br />\nCoach Collins.<br />\n\"Well, gee,\" said Mud Foot as he stammered<br />\nfrom foot to foot,\"I really had to pee, Coach.\"<br />\n\"Well, that's okay, Mud Foot. You can go<br />\npee if you have to, but next time pee before<br />\nthe inning starts, okay? That's what all the big<br />\nleaguers do, all right?\"<br /><br />\nThe News-Letter Books Section will be featuring examples of creative writing<br />\nHopkins<br />\nfrom<br />\nJohns<br />\nundergraduates.

Andrews<br />\nWarner Books, September, 1987,<br />\n$16.95<br />\nby Aravinda Pillalamarri<br />\nThe San Francisco Review of<br />\nBooks calls her genre \"Visionary<br />\nAutobiography.\" This is precisely why Crystal Woman fails to inspire the readers' credulity in<br />\nrespect to visions with its author,<br />\nLynn V. Andrews, has seen or of<br />\nthe prophetic value and mystically revelatory nature of the lessons<br />\nshe has to teach. Andrews has<br />\nwritten Medicine Woman, Flight<br />\nof the Seventh Moon, Jaguar<br />\nWoman, and Star Woman. Now,<br />\nin the form of Crystal Woman,<br />\nshe proposes to relate the story<br />\nwhich \"inhabited\" her while she<br />\nwas learning the traditions of the<br />\nKoori people of Australia. Andrews is a woman with a Calling,<br />\nand she knows it.<br />\nShe tells the story of her experiences as part of the sisterhood<br />\nof the Shields, \"a sacred shaman<br />\nsociety of forty-four women<br />\nrepresenting the power of woman<br />\nfrom different indigenous<br />\ncultures around the world.\" Andrews describes shamanism as a<br />\n\"subtle and alchemical process<br />\ndesigned to transform and elevate<br />\nthe spirit beyond the constructs of<br />\nthe known limits of reality. It is<br />\nthe space program of the soul and<br />\nlaunches you out into the unchartered territory Or the stars. It<br />\nteaches you to experience the<br />\nwisdom of the Pleiades and the<br />\nuniverse, not just the physical<br />\nproperties of the planets.\"<br />\nOne could open the book to a<br />\nchance page and find something<br />\nlike the following statement from<br />\nAgnes Whistling Elk, who is a<br />\nMedicine woman from Canada<br />\nwho becomes Andrew's teacher.<br />\nWe see things because oflight. If<br />\nthere was no light then we would<br />\nsee nothing. Perhaps then nothing<br />\nwould exist. Perhaps then all<br />\nthere is is light.<br />\nFortunately for us simpletons,<br />\nthere is someone named Ruby,<br /><br />\nwho is also a mentor of Andrews', to dissent, \"I bump into<br />\nlots of things in the<br />\ndark. . . . Things exist in the<br />\ndark,\" while Andrews herself<br />\ncan only reply, \"Yes, I guess<br />\nso.\" Just as Andrews' response<br />\nto new arguments is acceptance,<br />\nher response to new experiences<br />\nis fear. She is indeed exemplary<br />\nof the Ordinary Person who has<br />\nbeen Chosen for a Mission, and<br />\nso invites her ordinary readers to<br />\nbelieve, appealing to them by virtue of her own disinclination to<br />\nbelieve, testified by her fear,<br />\nwhich has been transformed into<br />\nfaith. Why? Because she has<br />\ndiscovered the Truth.<br />\nThe story opens with a journey,<br />\na microcosm of the spiritual<br />\njourney to be unfolded in the rest<br />\nof the autobiography. Andrews<br />\nand Agnes Whistling Elk, to<br />\nwhom she is an apprentice, are<br />\ndriving into the remote<br />\nwilderness of Australia for a convention of shaman women who<br />\nwould share their knowledge<br />\namong themselves and their apprentices. Her descriptions are<br />\nquite vivid, and she often uses<br />\nlanguage that engages the mind<br />\nand draws the reader into her<br />\nnatural world. Still, no series of<br />\nmetaphors can serve her when<br />\nshe wishes to describe her contacts with supernatural forces.<br />\nWhen she tries to do this, her<br />\nstory becomes unbelievable. It is<br />\nnot the legitimacy of her experiences that is in question, nor<br />\nher sincerity in wanting to convey her message. After all, she<br />\nstates the cause of the problem<br />\n(indeed, of all problems), as \"the<br />\nimbalance between male and<br />\nfemale energies that is disrupting<br />\nthe world.\" The Sisterhood, as<br />\none might guess, is for Women<br />\nOnly, because men cannot be<br />\ntrusted. In any case, this is a problem which has been identified<br />\nfrom ancient times as fundamental in the natural world: it is the<br />\nbalance of yin and yang. So it is<br />\nno great surprise that this woman<br />\nshould discover it for herself and<br />\nfeel evangelical about it. But it is<br /><br />\nthe way with spiritual experiences<br />\nthat one must discover them by<br />\nones self. Andrews begins to<br />\nrealize this when she writes in her<br />\nintroduction that, \"To write adequately about shamanism, one has<br />\nto become a shaman.\" She only<br />\nmust see that logical conclusion<br />\nof the statement would prevent<br />\nher from even trying to make someone, who had not had her experiences, understand them.<br />\nThe format of her book does<br />\nnot help, either. If most spiritual<br />\nexperiences remain uncommunicated, the ones that do are<br />\nusually not presented for mass<br />\nconsumption. Resisting the temptation to note that this book is<br />\npublished by Warner Books, let<br />\nus just go on to look within the<br />\ncover (which, by the way, is<br />\nreminiscent of the \"flashing<br />\neyes\" and \"floating hair\" of Coleridge). Each chapter of average<br />\nlength eight pages is introduced<br />\nby a quote which one guesses<br />\nshould be thought-provoking, and<br />\na<br />\nfull-page<br />\nillustration,<br />\npresumably to express those images that are beyond words.<br />\nFinally, there are large chapter<br />\ntitles, complete with diamondshape designs, which seem to<br />\nhave a desire to arrest ones attention and cat,se one to say,\"Wow,<br />\nthat's deep.\" It is difficult not to<br />\nbe reminded of the National<br />\nEnquirer.<br />\nAndrews does go on to fulfill<br />\nher Personal Mission, to rectify<br />\nan injustice in the world in which<br />\nthe Powers are unbalanced, the<br />\nusual superhero story. In saving<br />\nthe world, she realizes the reflection of cosmic balance in herself,<br />\nher own combination of male and<br />\nfemale forces which she must<br />\nutilize and of coupe keep in<br />\nbalance. Although it is an old<br />\ntheme, it is very true, and perhaps<br />\namong the most important lessons<br />\nof the cosmos. It is a lesson,<br />\nhowever, which must be learned<br />\nindividually and subtly, and it is<br />\nbecause of this that Andrew's effort, albeit sincere, is<br />\nunsuccessful.<br /><br />\n24/FEBRUARY 12, 1988<br /><br />\nScience<br /><br />\nCondoms: Preventing<br />\nSexually Transmitted Diseases<br />\nThe News-Letter is covering<br />\nthis topic and enclosing a condom<br />\nso as to heighten awareness about<br />\nSexually Transmitted Diseases.<br />\nThe News-Letter is not trying to<br />\nadvocate any sexual practices or<br />\nbeliefs.

Dr. Arnall<br />\nPatz, from the School of<br />\nMedicine, outlined the use of<br />\nlasers in opthalmology to a<br />\ncapacity crowd in the Garrett<br />\nRoom for February's Welch<br />\nlecture.

He has published<br />\nover 240 books and articles,<br />\nand has been a member of the<br />\nHopkins faculty since 1955.<br />\nCurrently, he is the William<br />\nHoward Wilmer Professor and<br />\nDirector of Ophthalmology for<br />\nJHMI. Dr. Patz has received<br />\nmany awards, including the<br />\nhighly prestigious Lasker<br />\nAward.<br />\nThe lasers Dr. Patz and<br />\nothers use in the surgery was<br />\ndeveloped at Hopkins. Dr.<br />\nBob Flower, senior physicist<br />\nat the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory and Associate Professor of Ophthalmology, explained how a laser (Light<br />\nAmplification by Stimulated<br />\nEmission of Radiation) functions, and Dr. Patz explained<br /><br />\nthe particulars of the \"pingpong\" laser he uses.(A pingpong ball is used to measure<br />\nthe intensity of the light beam,<br />\nto an accuracy which Dr. Patz<br />\nsays exceeds that of $60,000<br />\nequipment.)<br />\nThe laser beam is transmitted to the eye through an optical fiber attached to a special<br />\ncontact lens. A drop of<br />\nanaesthetic to ease insertion of<br />\nthis lens is the only pain killer<br />\nrequired for any of the<br />\nprocedures.<br />\nGlaucoma results from a<br />\ndisruption in the normal circulation of fluid behind the<br />\niris. The excess fluid causes<br />\npressure that can lead to blindness. Traditionally, the<br />\nsurgeon used a scalpel to open<br />\nthe eye and drain the fluid. Patients were hospitalized for<br />\ntwo to four days. Now, patients visit their doctor's office<br />\nand undergo treatment for six<br />\nto seven minutes for each eye.<br />\nThe laser simply punches a<br />\nhole through the iris to allow<br />\nnormal circulation. Dr. Patz<br />\nstressed that \"Early detection<br />\nand early control is the<br />\nsecret.\"<br />\nWhen light is focused, some<br />\nof its energy is converted to<br />\nheat. Laser light, when focused thorugh the special contact<br />\nlens and the lens of the eye<br />\nitself, can burn the retina (the<br />\nsurface of light-receptor cells<br />\nat the back of the eye). A<br />\nburned retina may not sound<br />\nlike a medical breakthrough,<br />\nbut in the right hands, it can<br />\nbe an alternative to blindness.<br />\nThe retina, like all tissues of<br />\nthe body, must receive<br />\nnourishment through the blood<br />\nvessels. Some victims of<br />\ndiabetes develop diabetic<br />\nretinopathy, which can lead to<br />\nleakage of blood through<br />\nswollen (aneurysms) or<br /><br />\nhemorrhaged vessels. Blood in<br />\nthe jelly-like center of the eye<br />\ncan prevent light from falling<br />\non the retina. Victims of AgeRelated Macular Degeneration<br />\nhave a similar difficulty.<br />\nThrough the years, the retina<br />\ndeteriorates. When the tissue<br />\nitself is damaged, lasers cannot help. However, lasers are<br />\nable to 'weld' leaking vessels,<br />\nand in a few months, the excess fluid is reabsorbed.<br />\nVisual acuity returns to 20/20<br />\nwhen the fluid is gone.<br />\nThe laser is carefully aimed<br />\n(as Dr. Patz said, \"not to be<br />\ndone on a Monday morning<br />\nwith a shaky hand\") to avoid<br />\nhealthy major blood vessels by<br />\nonly 1/75 of an inch. The<br />\nastonishing films of the procedure showed that the sharpshooting of an experienced<br />\npractitioner can completely<br />\nstop the leaks and hemorrhages in 1000 or 1200 rapidfire bursts of light. As long as<br />\nthe most sensitive part of the<br />\nretina, the macula, is spared<br />\nfrom damage, the laser can accomplish \"complete resolution of the patient's abnormality,\" Dr. Patz said.<br />\nsome<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\nperipheral vision must be<br />\ndestroyed to save the macula,<br />\nwhich is responsible for<br />\nreading and most other types<br />\nof sight. Dr. Patz realizes the<br />\nlimitations of this procedure.<br />\nHe does not term this treatment as a cure, but as \"a<br />\nstopgap treatment for this<br />\ndecade. . . hopefully, we will<br />\nhave a biochemical treatment<br />\nto inhibit abnormal growth.\"<br />\nA final application for lasers<br />\nis after cataract surgery, which<br />\nis the removal of a haze on the<br />\nlens common in elderly people.

One was by bowing out<br />\nwith grace and dignity. Ted<br />\nWilliams may be the most prominent example of a player who left<br />\nthe game while still on top. Having been humbled by a sub-par<br />\n.254 season in 1959, the Splendid Splinter rebounded in his<br />\nfarewell season of 1960 by hitting<br />\n.316 and slamming 29 homers in<br />\nonly 310 at-bats. The last of those<br /><br />\nhome runs, incidentally, was can probably think of an example:<br />\ndelivered on his last at-bat in his my favorite at this moment is<br />\nlast game ever, in Fenway Park.

Tom<br />\nboth their legend and the respect Seaver, one of the greatest pitthey once commanded. Everyone chers of our or any other generation, disappeared from the major<br />\nleague scene without so much as<br />\na farewell performance. And it's<br />\nnot as if his fans everywhere<br />\nshould have expected his sudden<br />\ndeparture; on the contrary, he<br /><br />\nwas still doing very well, thank<br />\nyou. Granted, his 1986 record of<br />\n7-13 is pretty bad, but you must<br />\nunderstand that Tom received<br />\nfewer runs of support than any of<br />\nhis fellow rotation mates that<br />\nyear. That includes his White Sox<br />\nteammates as well as his last<br />\nteammates, the men from the<br />\nLegion of Doom. Tom's ERA<br />\nwas better than the league<br />\naverage, and he received tremendous credit for stabilizing the Red<br />\nSox rotation in the time that Red<br />\nSox fortunes began to collapse<br />\nwholesale. All in all, not a bad<br />\nyear.<br />\nAfter the 1986 season, though,<br />\nthe Red Sox management chose<br />\nto ignore all that, chose to ignore<br />\nthe fact that they were desperate<br />\nfor pitchers, chose above all to ignore the fact that they had in their<br />\nmidst a living legend who was<br />\nstill producing, and refused to<br /><br />\nbring Tom Terrific back. It made<br />\nfor a curious finish to a dazzling<br />\ncareer.
