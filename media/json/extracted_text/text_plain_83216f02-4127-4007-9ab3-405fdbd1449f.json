M VINCENT<br />\n<br />\n[This is the sixth of the series of<br />\narticles on war problems written for'<br />\nTILE NEWS-LETTER by a member of the<br />\nfaculty. Dr. Vincent, as professor of<br />\nEuropean history, is in a position to<br />\ngive expert opinion on the problems<br />\nthat will demand solution at the hands<br />\nof the , peace congress after the war.<br />\nIn view of the President's most recent<br />\naddress, the article has added significance.\u2014ED.<br />\n<br />\nThe war has brought into<br />\nhigher prominence than ever the<br />\nrights, privileges and misfortunes<br />\nof the small nation. The territories, the political institutions, the<br />\nlives of the inhabitants have been<br />\nruthlessly trodden under foot. In<br />\nfact, this disregard of common humanity, not to speak of solemn<br />\ntreaty obligations, is the thing<br />\nwhich has drawn the civilized nations of the world, one by one,<br />\ninto this conflict. As we look forward to the expected victory over<br />\nthe marauding powers the questions of settlement loom into<br />\nlarger and larger view. Foremost<br />\namong these are the measures to<br />\nbe taken to prevent such outbreaks in the future. \"The world<br />\nmust be made safe for democracy,\" to be sure, but the system<br />\nby which this security is to be<br />\nmaintained is not so easy either<br />\nto define or to adopt.<br />\nSome method will be-found, but<br />\nin the process further questions<br />\nmust be answered as to what constitutes a nation. The philosophers, the philologians and the<br />\npractical politicians have all confidently supplied their replies, but<br />\nneither the pedagogue nor the<br />\ndemagogue can determine alone<br />\nthe practical, political and ethnological puzzle which the map of<br />\nEurope now presents. Consequently, I do not propose to solve<br />\nthe problem here. It is wise, however, to consider the intricacy of<br />\nthe subject in advance, so that<br />\nwhen the peace negotiators get together we may judge whether we,<br />\nas well as the nations involved,<br />\nare to get the results for which<br />\nwe fought.<br />\nThe nineteenth century has witnessed a great revival of national<br />\nspirit based on remembrance of<br />\nformer conditions and vitalized by<br />\ncommon language and literature.<br />\nOne can only sympathize with<br />\nthese cultural aspirations, but it<br />\nis quite another question to decide whether political boundaries<br />\nshould be made to conform to the<br />\nlimits of language or dialect.<br />\n(Continued on 'age 2, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nGREATER<br />\n<br />\n\"We must recognize the personal, our personal, our<br />\nindividual responsibility\u2014 not the other fellow's, but our<br />\nresponsibility in this war.\"<br />\n\"These War Savings Stamps and United States Thrift<br />\nStamps are going to make it easy to learn this lesson of<br />\npersonal responsibility.

Sir Walter, who appeared in the field uniform of the<br />\nBritish army, was introduced to<br />\nthe battalion by the commandant,<br />\nMajor Guild.<br />\nSir Walter opened his speech<br />\nwith a glowing tribute to France,<br />\npicturing vividly the rows of<br />\nwooden crosses, the women in<br />\nmourning, the women plowing in<br />\nthe fields until dark, the pain and<br />\ndetermination written on every<br />\nface.<br />\nThe United States then came in<br />\nfor its share of praise. England,<br />\nthe speaker said, had always believed she was fighting for the<br />\nright, but when America entered<br />\nthe war, the British knew they<br />\nwere right. \"It was not so much<br />\nthe resources of America that<br />\nwe wanted when you went into<br />\nthe war.

It is<br />\nnoteworthy that this is the first<br />\nschool of its kind to be organized<br />\nin this country and that the<br />\nRockefeller Foundation decided<br />\nto locate the school at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University \"largely by<br />\nreason of the facilities, organization and ideals of its Medical<br />\nSchool.\"<br />\n.It was mainly through the efforts of Dr. William H.

Indeed, we are<br />\ntold that Austria, in order to prevent Italy from going into the<br />\nwar, offered to cede the province<br />\nof Trent up to the actual Sprachgrenze.<br />\nItaly, however, wished to go<br />\nfurther, so that the iatlusion of<br />\nanother valley would strengthen<br />\nher defensive position. Thus language and political geography conflict, though doubtless a compromise can be reached. Italian Dalmatia is now become Slavic and a<br />\nwhole Italian state in Switzerland<br />\nhas no desire to be joined to Italy.<br />\nSo language fails as a criterion.<br />\nIt seems imperative that Belgium should be restored to its peo.<br />\npie, but if nationality should rest<br />\non language we are confronted by<br />\nthe fact that Flemish is spoken<br />\nby a large portion of the people<br />\nand for the rest their speech is<br />\nFrench. Some other principle<br />\nmust be found to settle this case.<br />\nIn the Balkan peninsula and on<br />\nthe eastern front the linguistic<br />\nsituation is far more complicated.<br />\nThe Balkan wars of many genera-<br />\n<br />\ntions have been waged by peoples<br />\nrelated in language, but who differed slightly in religious belief.<br />\nThe focus of this conflict is found<br />\nin Macedonia, where the races and<br />\nreligions overlap. This has been<br />\nfor ages a heated inciting pot in<br />\nwhich the Serbs, Bulgarians,<br />\nGreeks, Albanians and Turks have<br />\ndisplayed their refractory qualities.<br />\nThe mark of distinction here is<br />\nreligion. The Serbs hold to the<br />\noriginal Greek Church, while the<br />\nBulgarians have for some time<br />\nmaintained a Greek ritual with a<br />\npatriarch of their own. The two<br />\npeoples are racially related, but<br />\nin the disputed territory they<br />\nhave been persecuting one another to the limit of endurance.<br />\nThe Serbs have now been driven<br />\nfrom their country by the Central<br />\nPowers and should have it restored, but the world can no<br />\nlonger look with patience on this<br />\nmurderous quarrel between the<br />\nsmall states. Some means must<br />\nbe found to keep the peace, based on<br />\nconsiderations other than linguistic or religious.<br />\nA political arrangement that<br />\nwill permit the cultural and economic development of each of<br />\nthese peoples must be the task of<br />\nthe coming peace congress. It will<br />\nnot be easy. The Greek is dreaming of ancient Byzantium when<br />\nConstantinople was the center of<br />\nGreek civilization. Not only that,<br />\nbut his fellow countrymen now<br />\nhold the fringes of the Aegean<br />\nSea in the grip of their commercial enterprises. The Bulgarian<br />\nwants a coast line on the Black<br />\nSea and the Mediterranean at the<br />\nsame time. The Serb wants an<br />\noutlet to the Adriatic. All of<br />\nthese demands are such that the<br />\nlines of demarkation could not follow language boundaries exclusively.<br />\nIf Rumania were to include all<br />\nof the people who speak a common<br />\ntongue, it would absorb a large<br />\npiece of Hungary and a part of<br />\nthe Russian province of Bessarabia. The latter was wrongfully, taken away in peace negotiations in 1878, when Russia had the<br />\npower to dominate small nations,<br />\nbut for Rumania to annex Hungarian Transylvania opens a question in which political consequences as well as racial affinity<br />\nmust be considered. The Hungarian government of its Rumanian subjects has been selfish and<br />\ncruel. The attempt to make them<br />\ninto Magyars by suppressing the<br />\nRumanian elementary schools and<br />\nby forbidding the language in<br />\nchurch services has the familiar<br />\nBismarckian ring.<br />\nOn the map the Rumanianspeaking population lies compactly in a large circle, cutting into<br />\nHungary and Russia. It is divided by mountain chains and<br />\nlarge rivers, but it would seem<br />\nthat so long as Hungary maintains its repressive attitude separation is tlie only hope for the cultural aspirations of this people.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nEdited by FRANK MORLEY, with<br />\nthe co-operation of A.

BALTIMORE STREET<br />\n<br />\nThe Poles have never forgotten<br />\nthat they once were independent.<br />\nThey were not very successful in<br />\nself-government, and it was in<br />\npart their own fault that they<br />\nwere absorbed by the surrounding states. As a whole, however,<br />\nit was forcible dismemberment by<br />\npowerful nations whom they could<br />\nnot have resisted. Their treatment by Russia and Prussia has<br />\nbeen a further wanton disregard<br />\nof their national self-respect and<br />\ntheir natural rights. Yet the restoration at this late hour will be<br />\nno easy task when it comes to fixing the boundaries of a Polish<br />\nstate. How much shall the outlying fringes of Prussia and Austria be cut off to make a satisfactory Poland? Shall a strip be<br />\ncut tWoug the heart of Prussia<br />\nto give the Poles their ancient<br />\ncity of Danzig and access to the<br />\nsea? Germany will need to be<br />\nbadly beaten to gain her consent<br />\nto this.<br />\nFrom these few examples it<br />\nwould appear that no single rigid<br />\ndefinition of nationality will be<br />\nsatisfactory in actual practice. In<br />\nfixing the limits of nations some<br />\nregard must be paid to accomplished facts in history, to economic conditions and in part to<br />\nstrategic considerations. At the<br />\nsame time the wishes of the people in a given geographic group<br />\nought to be regarded, when that<br />\ngroup desires and is conscious of<br />\npolitical adhesion, whether they<br />\nspeak one language or three.<br />\nThe rise of nationalism has been<br />\ndue to the artificial repression of<br />\ncultural aspirations of language<br />\ngroups. In Austria the German<br />\ngeneral government prohibited for<br />\nyears the teaching of Czechish to<br />\nthe Bohemians. In Prussia the<br />\nPolish population has been given<br />\nthe third degree of Germanization.<br />\nRussia went as far as it could in<br />\nthe same direction in its part of<br />\nPoland. The small nations have<br />\nseen no remedy except complete<br />\npolitical independence.<br />\nThe peace conferences at the<br />\nend of this world war cannot overlook the call of these _national and<br />\ncultural groups, yet certain economic considerations must not be<br />\nneglected. The small nation is<br />\nnot necessarily a good business<br />\nproposition, either to itself or to<br />\nthe world at large. If we are to<br />\nsee tariff barriers set up at every<br />\nnew boundary, and currency systems changing every few hours on<br />\na railway journey, the economic<br />\nconditions of Europe will be set<br />\nback two centuries. The modern<br />\nworld is too interdependent to be<br />\nsatisfied with this, consequently<br />\nthe articles of peace will only<br />\npostpone the war if they do not<br />\nprovide for international comity<br />\nin trade relations.<br />\nIn some cases a political separation may not be necessary. It<br />\nmay well be the duty of a world<br />\ncongress to exact guarantees from<br />\nlarger powers that the national<br />\ngroups within their boundaries<br />\nshall enjoy self-government and<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nGREATER RESOURCES NEEDED.<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\n<br />\ngreat war, the President says:<br />\n\"The call to arms to which the college men of this land responded<br />\nso generally last spring has necessarily had serious effects on our<br />\ninstitutional life. Many members<br />\nof our faculty and many former<br />\nstudents are now serving their<br />\ncountry in the military services.<br />\nOthers have entered some one of<br />\nthe civil services. The result is<br />\nthat we shall open the coming<br />\nyear shorthanded so far as concerns our teaching force, and with<br />\na considerably smaller number of<br />\nstudents than we should have had<br />\nthe right to expect in normal<br />\ntimes.\"<br />\nIn conclusion of the general<br />\npart of the report, President<br />\nGoodnow adds:\"I have mentioned<br />\nthese things only as an indication<br />\nof the willingness of the University to do what it can for the country at this time. We all wish that<br />\nour facilities were such that we<br />\nmight do more than we have been<br />\nable to do.\"<br />\nAs to the needs of the University, the President has these significant remarks to make: \"The<br />\nmost pressing need of the University is the same to which attention<br />\nwas called in my last report. That<br />\nis an increase in the endowment<br />\napplicable to general purposes.<br />\nThis increased endowment is necessary in the first place to make it<br />\npossible for us to carry on our<br />\nwork on its present scale without<br />\na continually recurring deficit,<br />\nand, second, to provide for necessary salary increases.<br />\n\"On the other hand salary increases are now even more important than ever, because of the<br />\ncontinual increase in the cost of<br />\nliving.

Simon,'20, to the board of associate editors.<br />\nRemember the Tuscania!<br />\n<br />\nIn the last week we felt the<br />\nshock of the first blow from our<br />\nenemy across the sea; that blow,<br />\nregardless of the despicable, unAerhand manner in which it was<br />\ndealt, was measured in the lives<br />\nof more than two hundred of<br />\nour boys. Lest we forget, we<br />\nare engaged with Germany in<br />\na fight for our lives, for our<br />\ncountry and the ideals it represents. Every blow counts for<br />\nwhat it is\u2014measured in blood and<br />\ntreasure, not in chivalry and heroism. Germany has landed the first<br />\ntelling blow of the conflict we<br />\nknow it because we felt it. What<br />\nshall be our answer to the sinking<br />\nof the Tuscania?<br />\nIf we may judge by precedent,<br />\nthat answer will be \"Remember the<br />\nTuscania!\" translated into action<br />\nin terms of an unfailing determination to crush that intolerable<br />\nPrussian military machine and<br />\nthe unfaltering support\u2014tothelast<br />\niota of our resources and strength<br />\n\u2014of time American Army in<br />\nFrance. It is almost exactly a<br />\nscore of years since, that the loss<br />\nof approximately the same number of lives by the same insidious,<br />\ncowardly methods brought this<br />\nnation to its feet and to its arms<br />\nwith the cry from a hundred million throats: \"Remember the<br />\nMaine!\" The same deepfelt indignation and angry determination<br />\nthat shook the nation in '98 has<br />\nshaken it today. As was the coun-<br />\n<br />\ntry momentarily mobilized tw.enty<br />\nyears ago, so will it be today.<br />\nIn times like these, we who are<br />\nstill at college feel helpless and<br />\nuseless and hopeless; in our position-3,000 miles away from the<br />\nenemy's front line\u2014we can't, at<br />\nleast for a while, return blow<br />\nfor blow; we can only talk and \u2022<br />\ndrill and study, and believe men<br />\nlike Sir Walter when they tell us<br />\nthat we should finish our college<br />\nwork. But Sir Walter told us that<br />\nwe could and must do more than<br />\nthat. It isfor us to back our soldiers<br />\nin France and our sailorson the sea<br />\nto our last ounce of strength and<br />\nour last atom of resources. If you<br />\nwill read the special editorial elsewhere on this page, you will understand that wars must be<br />\nfought with money as well as with<br />\nmen; that we must practice thrift<br />\nif we are to win the war. The success of Government loans and<br />\nbond issues means not one wit less<br />\nthan a great military victory;<br />\nand, moreover, the importance of \u2022<br />\nthe issues may not be measured<br />\nby the denominations into which<br />\nthey are divided, but only by their<br />\ncomplete success. Over two hundred Americans went bravely<br />\ndown to a watery grave for the<br />\nsake of every one of us. Over a<br />\nmillion pore are courageously<br />\nfacing death among the hills of<br />\nFrance. In order that those boys<br />\nmay have food, shelter, and arms,<br />\nthe Government asks you to practice thrift, and to lend the Government your savings through the<br />\nmedium of War Saving Stamps.<br />\nRemember the Tuscania!<br />\nWorthy and<br />\n<br />\nUnworthy of Battalion<br />\nTraditions.<br />\n<br />\nIt is highly to the credit of the<br />\nmembers of the Battalion that a<br />\nblizzard had such an *insignificant<br />\neffect on the attendance at the last<br />\ndrill of the last semester. Cars<br />\nwere not running, the snow was a<br />\nfoot deep, and it was bitter cold;<br />\nin fact, there were excuses for absence galore. In spite of which,<br />\nthe great majority of the Battalion appeared at drill and on<br />\ntime. It was a happy illustration<br />\neither of a highly developed esprit<br />\nde corps on time part of the Battalion or of efficient military organization and strict military discipline on the part of Major Guild.<br />\nPerhaps it was the former; or perhaps it was both. Frankness demands, however, that we attribute<br />\nit chiefly to the later.<br />\nIt is highly to the discredit of<br />\nthe Battalion that a similar blizzard two days later had such a<br />\nnoticeable effect on the attendance<br />\nof a lecture by Major-General<br />\nBlack, chief of engineers, U. S. A.<br />\nThe Battalion had demonstrated<br />\non Monday that blizzards were no<br />\nobstacles in the way of-their wills.<br />\nThere was hardly a corporal's<br />\nguard on hand on Wednesday. I<br />\nmay surprise you when I say that<br />\nthe chief of engineers did not lose<br />\nor suffer in the ],east through your<br />\nabsence. Not only did you lose<br />\n<br />\npersonally the advice and instruction and highly interesting pictures of a lecture by the highest<br />\nauthority in the land, but the Battalion\u2014your Battalion\u2014lost prestige in the eyes of a high military<br />\nauthority. We may be wrong in<br />\nour belief, but we honestly believe<br />\nthat it would have shown much<br />\nbetter spirit if you had braved the<br />\nblizzard on Wednesday night rather than on Monday morning; your<br />\npersonal record was at stake in<br />\none instance, the Battalion and<br />\nUniversity record was at stake in<br />\nthe other.<br />\nThe Relation of Saving to the War.<br />\n(A special editorial, written for THE NEWSLETTER by an international authority on public<br />\nfinance.)<br />\n<br />\nThere have been since the entrance of this country into the<br />\ngreat war a number of campaigns<br />\nfor funds either for government<br />\nloans or for such activities as the<br />\nRed Cross or the Y.

But<br />\nwhile money is a necessity, money<br />\nwill not win the war. Even an<br />\ninexhaustible supply of. gold or<br />\ncredits is of use only in so far as<br />\nit facilitates the manufacture of<br />\nthe things needed for military operations.

We<br />\nshall be saving money which,<br />\nthrough taxes and loans, we can<br />\ngive the Government to pay for<br />\nthe new products which military<br />\nnecessities require.

In these times<br />\nit may also be said that he who<br />\nsaves accomplishes a double purpose. On the one hand he discourages the making of things<br />\nwhich are for the moment un-,<br />\nnecessary. On the other, he furthers the production of what is<br />\nneeded, and at the same time increases the means\u2014in the only<br />\nway in which they can be increased\u2014for the purchase of the<br />\ntimings innnediately needful.<br />\nEconomy by the rich and devotion of their savings to the purchase of Government loans will<br />\nnot be sufficient. If, we are to<br />\nfree the labor necessary for the<br />\nproduction of the timings needed<br />\nin time war, and if we are to secure the funds wherewith to pay<br />\nfor.these things, the great mass of<br />\npeople must economize.

In<br />\nfact, this disregard of common humanity, not to speak of solemn<br />\ntreaty obligations, is the thing<br />\nwhich has drawn the civilized nations of the world, one by one,<br />\ninto this conflict. As we look forward to the expected victory over<br />\nthe marauding powers the questions of settlement loom into<br />\nlarger and larger view. Foremost<br />\namong these are the measures to<br />\nbe taken to prevent such outbreaks in the future. \"The world<br />\nmust be made safe for democracy,\" to be sure, but the system<br />\nby which this security is to be<br />\nmaintained is not so easy either<br />\nto define or to adopt.<br />\nSome method will be-found, but<br />\nin the process further questions<br />\nmust be answered as to what constitutes a nation.

Indeed, we are<br />\ntold that Austria, in order to prevent Italy from going into the<br />\nwar, offered to cede the province<br />\nof Trent up to the actual Sprachgrenze.<br />\nItaly, however, wished to go<br />\nfurther, so that the iatlusion of<br />\nanother valley would strengthen<br />\nher defensive position. Thus language and political geography conflict, though doubtless a compromise can be reached. Italian Dalmatia is now become Slavic and a<br />\nwhole Italian state in Switzerland<br />\nhas no desire to be joined to Italy.<br />\nSo language fails as a criterion.<br />\nIt seems imperative that Belgium should be restored to its peo.<br />\npie, but if nationality should rest<br />\non language we are confronted by<br />\nthe fact that Flemish is spoken<br />\nby a large portion of the people<br />\nand for the rest their speech is<br />\nFrench. Some other principle<br />\nmust be found to settle this case.<br />\nIn the Balkan peninsula and on<br />\nthe eastern front the linguistic<br />\nsituation is far more complicated.<br />\nThe Balkan wars of many genera-<br /><br />\ntions have been waged by peoples<br />\nrelated in language, but who differed slightly in religious belief.<br />\nThe focus of this conflict is found<br />\nin Macedonia, where the races and<br />\nreligions overlap. This has been<br />\nfor ages a heated inciting pot in<br />\nwhich the Serbs, Bulgarians,<br />\nGreeks, Albanians and Turks have<br />\ndisplayed their refractory qualities.<br />\nThe mark of distinction here is<br />\nreligion. The Serbs hold to the<br />\noriginal Greek Church, while the<br />\nBulgarians have for some time<br />\nmaintained a Greek ritual with a<br />\npatriarch of their own. The two<br />\npeoples are racially related, but<br />\nin the disputed territory they<br />\nhave been persecuting one another to the limit of endurance.<br />\nThe Serbs have now been driven<br />\nfrom their country by the Central<br />\nPowers and should have it restored, but the world can no<br />\nlonger look with patience on this<br />\nmurderous quarrel between the<br />\nsmall states. Some means must<br />\nbe found to keep the peace, based on<br />\nconsiderations other than linguistic or religious.<br />\nA political arrangement that<br />\nwill permit the cultural and economic development of each of<br />\nthese peoples must be the task of<br />\nthe coming peace congress. It will<br />\nnot be easy. The Greek is dreaming of ancient Byzantium when<br />\nConstantinople was the center of<br />\nGreek civilization. Not only that,<br />\nbut his fellow countrymen now<br />\nhold the fringes of the Aegean<br />\nSea in the grip of their commercial enterprises. The Bulgarian<br />\nwants a coast line on the Black<br />\nSea and the Mediterranean at the<br />\nsame time. The Serb wants an<br />\noutlet to the Adriatic. All of<br />\nthese demands are such that the<br />\nlines of demarkation could not follow language boundaries exclusively.<br />\nIf Rumania were to include all<br />\nof the people who speak a common<br />\ntongue, it would absorb a large<br />\npiece of Hungary and a part of<br />\nthe Russian province of Bessarabia. The latter was wrongfully, taken away in peace negotiations in 1878, when Russia had the<br />\npower to dominate small nations,<br />\nbut for Rumania to annex Hungarian Transylvania opens a question in which political consequences as well as racial affinity<br />\nmust be considered. The Hungarian government of its Rumanian subjects has been selfish and<br />\ncruel. The attempt to make them<br />\ninto Magyars by suppressing the<br />\nRumanian elementary schools and<br />\nby forbidding the language in<br />\nchurch services has the familiar<br />\nBismarckian ring.<br />\nOn the map the Rumanianspeaking population lies compactly in a large circle, cutting into<br />\nHungary and Russia. It is divided by mountain chains and<br />\nlarge rivers, but it would seem<br />\nthat so long as Hungary maintains its repressive attitude separation is tlie only hope for the cultural aspirations of this people.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nEdited by FRANK MORLEY, with<br />\nthe co-operation of A.

BALTIMORE STREET<br /><br />\nThe Poles have never forgotten<br />\nthat they once were independent.<br />\nThey were not very successful in<br />\nself-government, and it was in<br />\npart their own fault that they<br />\nwere absorbed by the surrounding states. As a whole, however,<br />\nit was forcible dismemberment by<br />\npowerful nations whom they could<br />\nnot have resisted. Their treatment by Russia and Prussia has<br />\nbeen a further wanton disregard<br />\nof their national self-respect and<br />\ntheir natural rights. Yet the restoration at this late hour will be<br />\nno easy task when it comes to fixing the boundaries of a Polish<br />\nstate. How much shall the outlying fringes of Prussia and Austria be cut off to make a satisfactory Poland? Shall a strip be<br />\ncut tWoug the heart of Prussia<br />\nto give the Poles their ancient<br />\ncity of Danzig and access to the<br />\nsea? Germany will need to be<br />\nbadly beaten to gain her consent<br />\nto this.<br />\nFrom these few examples it<br />\nwould appear that no single rigid<br />\ndefinition of nationality will be<br />\nsatisfactory in actual practice. In<br />\nfixing the limits of nations some<br />\nregard must be paid to accomplished facts in history, to economic conditions and in part to<br />\nstrategic considerations. At the<br />\nsame time the wishes of the people in a given geographic group<br />\nought to be regarded, when that<br />\ngroup desires and is conscious of<br />\npolitical adhesion, whether they<br />\nspeak one language or three.<br />\nThe rise of nationalism has been<br />\ndue to the artificial repression of<br />\ncultural aspirations of language<br />\ngroups. In Austria the German<br />\ngeneral government prohibited for<br />\nyears the teaching of Czechish to<br />\nthe Bohemians. In Prussia the<br />\nPolish population has been given<br />\nthe third degree of Germanization.<br />\nRussia went as far as it could in<br />\nthe same direction in its part of<br />\nPoland. The small nations have<br />\nseen no remedy except complete<br />\npolitical independence.<br />\nThe peace conferences at the<br />\nend of this world war cannot overlook the call of these _national and<br />\ncultural groups, yet certain economic considerations must not be<br />\nneglected. The small nation is<br />\nnot necessarily a good business<br />\nproposition, either to itself or to<br />\nthe world at large. If we are to<br />\nsee tariff barriers set up at every<br />\nnew boundary, and currency systems changing every few hours on<br />\na railway journey, the economic<br />\nconditions of Europe will be set<br />\nback two centuries. The modern<br />\nworld is too interdependent to be<br />\nsatisfied with this, consequently<br />\nthe articles of peace will only<br />\npostpone the war if they do not<br />\nprovide for international comity<br />\nin trade relations.<br />\nIn some cases a political separation may not be necessary. It<br />\nmay well be the duty of a world<br />\ncongress to exact guarantees from<br />\nlarger powers that the national<br />\ngroups within their boundaries<br />\nshall enjoy self-government and<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nGREATER RESOURCES NEEDED.<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br /><br />\ngreat war, the President says:<br />\n\"The call to arms to which the college men of this land responded<br />\nso generally last spring has necessarily had serious effects on our<br />\ninstitutional life. Many members<br />\nof our faculty and many former<br />\nstudents are now serving their<br />\ncountry in the military services.<br />\nOthers have entered some one of<br />\nthe civil services. The result is<br />\nthat we shall open the coming<br />\nyear shorthanded so far as concerns our teaching force, and with<br />\na considerably smaller number of<br />\nstudents than we should have had<br />\nthe right to expect in normal<br />\ntimes.\"<br />\nIn conclusion of the general<br />\npart of the report, President<br />\nGoodnow adds:\"I have mentioned<br />\nthese things only as an indication<br />\nof the willingness of the University to do what it can for the country at this time. We all wish that<br />\nour facilities were such that we<br />\nmight do more than we have been<br />\nable to do.\"<br />\nAs to the needs of the University, the President has these significant remarks to make: \"The<br />\nmost pressing need of the University is the same to which attention<br />\nwas called in my last report. That<br />\nis an increase in the endowment<br />\napplicable to general purposes.<br />\nThis increased endowment is necessary in the first place to make it<br />\npossible for us to carry on our<br />\nwork on its present scale without<br />\na continually recurring deficit,<br />\nand, second, to provide for necessary salary increases.<br />\n\"On the other hand salary increases are now even more important than ever, because of the<br />\ncontinual increase in the cost of<br />\nliving. If we cannot in some measure meet this increase we may not<br />\nbe able to keep with us some of the'<br />\nmost valuable members of our<br />\nteaching force.<br />\n\"We need, of course, some new<br />\nbuildings to do our work in the<br />\nmost effective manner. We can,<br />\nhowever, for the present do without them, if absolutely necessary.<br />\nBut we must have greater resources if we are to continue to do<br />\neven the work we are now doing,<br />\nwhich is chargeable to our general<br />\nfunds.\"<br />\nAttached to the report are the<br />\nreports from the different departments containing a statement both<br />\nof the work done during the year<br />\nand of some of our most pressing<br />\nneeds.<br />\nTwo men came out of a department store the other day.

Lest we forget, we<br />\nare engaged with Germany in<br />\na fight for our lives, for our<br />\ncountry and the ideals it represents. Every blow counts for<br />\nwhat it is\u2014measured in blood and<br />\ntreasure, not in chivalry and heroism. Germany has landed the first<br />\ntelling blow of the conflict we<br />\nknow it because we felt it. What<br />\nshall be our answer to the sinking<br />\nof the Tuscania?<br />\nIf we may judge by precedent,<br />\nthat answer will be \"Remember the<br />\nTuscania!\" translated into action<br />\nin terms of an unfailing determination to crush that intolerable<br />\nPrussian military machine and<br />\nthe unfaltering support\u2014tothelast<br />\niota of our resources and strength<br />\n\u2014of time American Army in<br />\nFrance. It is almost exactly a<br />\nscore of years since, that the loss<br />\nof approximately the same number of lives by the same insidious,<br />\ncowardly methods brought this<br />\nnation to its feet and to its arms<br />\nwith the cry from a hundred million throats: \"Remember the<br />\nMaine!\" The same deepfelt indignation and angry determination<br />\nthat shook the nation in '98 has<br />\nshaken it today. As was the coun-<br /><br />\ntry momentarily mobilized tw.enty<br />\nyears ago, so will it be today.<br />\nIn times like these, we who are<br />\nstill at college feel helpless and<br />\nuseless and hopeless; in our position-3,000 miles away from the<br />\nenemy's front line\u2014we can't, at<br />\nleast for a while, return blow<br />\nfor blow; we can only talk and \u2022<br />\ndrill and study, and believe men<br />\nlike Sir Walter when they tell us<br />\nthat we should finish our college<br />\nwork. But Sir Walter told us that<br />\nwe could and must do more than<br />\nthat. It isfor us to back our soldiers<br />\nin France and our sailorson the sea<br />\nto our last ounce of strength and<br />\nour last atom of resources. If you<br />\nwill read the special editorial elsewhere on this page, you will understand that wars must be<br />\nfought with money as well as with<br />\nmen; that we must practice thrift<br />\nif we are to win the war. The success of Government loans and<br />\nbond issues means not one wit less<br />\nthan a great military victory;<br />\nand, moreover, the importance of \u2022<br />\nthe issues may not be measured<br />\nby the denominations into which<br />\nthey are divided, but only by their<br />\ncomplete success. Over two hundred Americans went bravely<br />\ndown to a watery grave for the<br />\nsake of every one of us. Over a<br />\nmillion pore are courageously<br />\nfacing death among the hills of<br />\nFrance. In order that those boys<br />\nmay have food, shelter, and arms,<br />\nthe Government asks you to practice thrift, and to lend the Government your savings through the<br />\nmedium of War Saving Stamps.<br />\nRemember the Tuscania!<br />\nWorthy and<br /><br />\nUnworthy of Battalion<br />\nTraditions.<br /><br />\nIt is highly to the credit of the<br />\nmembers of the Battalion that a<br />\nblizzard had such an *insignificant<br />\neffect on the attendance at the last<br />\ndrill of the last semester. Cars<br />\nwere not running, the snow was a<br />\nfoot deep, and it was bitter cold;<br />\nin fact, there were excuses for absence galore. In spite of which,<br />\nthe great majority of the Battalion appeared at drill and on<br />\ntime. It was a happy illustration<br />\neither of a highly developed esprit<br />\nde corps on time part of the Battalion or of efficient military organization and strict military discipline on the part of Major Guild.<br />\nPerhaps it was the former; or perhaps it was both. Frankness demands, however, that we attribute<br />\nit chiefly to the later.<br />\nIt is highly to the discredit of<br />\nthe Battalion that a similar blizzard two days later had such a<br />\nnoticeable effect on the attendance<br />\nof a lecture by Major-General<br />\nBlack, chief of engineers, U. S. A.<br />\nThe Battalion had demonstrated<br />\non Monday that blizzards were no<br />\nobstacles in the way of-their wills.<br />\nThere was hardly a corporal's<br />\nguard on hand on Wednesday. I<br />\nmay surprise you when I say that<br />\nthe chief of engineers did not lose<br />\nor suffer in the ],east through your<br />\nabsence. Not only did you lose<br /><br />\npersonally the advice and instruction and highly interesting pictures of a lecture by the highest<br />\nauthority in the land, but the Battalion\u2014your Battalion\u2014lost prestige in the eyes of a high military<br />\nauthority. We may be wrong in<br />\nour belief, but we honestly believe<br />\nthat it would have shown much<br />\nbetter spirit if you had braved the<br />\nblizzard on Wednesday night rather than on Monday morning; your<br />\npersonal record was at stake in<br />\none instance, the Battalion and<br />\nUniversity record was at stake in<br />\nthe other.<br />\nThe Relation of Saving to the War.<br />\n(A special editorial, written for THE NEWSLETTER by an international authority on public<br />\nfinance.)<br /><br />\nThere have been since the entrance of this country into the<br />\ngreat war a number of campaigns<br />\nfor funds either for government<br />\nloans or for such activities as the<br />\nRed Cross or the Y.

But<br />\nwhile money is a necessity, money<br />\nwill not win the war. Even an<br />\ninexhaustible supply of. gold or<br />\ncredits is of use only in so far as<br />\nit facilitates the manufacture of<br />\nthe things needed for military operations.

The factory which has produced motor<br />\ncars must devote itself to airplanes and motor trucks. The<br />\nshop which made clothes must<br />\nmake uniforms.

We<br />\nshall be saving money which,<br />\nthrough taxes and loans, we can<br />\ngive the Government to pay for<br />\nthe new products which military<br />\nnecessities require. The war must<br />\nbe financed out of income. If I<br />\nsell a house or dispose of any part<br />\nof my capital in order to pay the<br />\ntaxes which the Government demands of me or in order to subscribe to a Government loan to<br />\nthe extent that I increase my own<br />\nability to give may money.to the<br />\nGovernment, I am diminishing the<br />\nability of some one else.

But I am by selling<br />\nmy property in no way increasing the resources of the country.<br />\nI shall, however, be of great<br />\nhelp to the .Government if I economize in my expenditures and give<br />\nwhat I save.
