At the front of the<br />\nroom, sitting in folding chairs<br />\nand yawning, were other<br />\ncoordinators of the Muskie<br />\ncampaign. The folding chairs<br />\nfilling the room were occupied<br />\nby delegate-aspirants, all of<br />\nwhom were dressed in coats and<br />\nties, except for the one<br />\n\"representative young person,\"<br />\nwho wore a body shirt.<br />\nThe meeting began as the<br />\nChairman, speaking in his best<br />\nMonty Hall sincerity tone, asked<br />\nfor the aspirants' ideas on the<br />\nselection process.

No<br />\nconsensus was ever glimpsed and<br />\nthe aspirants lapsed into silence<br />\nwaiting for the chance to sell<br />\nthemselves modestly but<br />\nforcefully.<br />\nTed then gave them their<br />\nchance. The Chairman<br />\npronounced each name with<br />\nsobriety and respect. The<br />\ndelegate-aspirants got the<br />\nmessage- everyone here will be<br />\nconsidered equally and<br />\nfairly; really, guys.<br />\nThe first to be heard was<br />\nBarbara Mikulski, a member of<br />\nthe Baltimore City Council. \"My<br />\nname is Barbara Mikulski... and<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nAlso present was the<br />\neffervescent, epileptic Housewife,<br />\nwho spoke of the kids' cute<br />\nslogan, Send Morn to Miami for<br />\nMuskie.

Little did anyone know<br />\nhow long the other 91 vendors<br />\nwould peddle their wares.<br />\nBut they were all there in<br />\nforce. There were the<br />\nsilver-haired, forty year-old<br />\nwomen representing the<br />\nsuburban political club set. The<br />\nsmug \"I'm one of you, the<br />\norganization cocktail party<br />\nclique\" tone of voice is only<br />\nexceeded by the size of the<br />\nearrings, the thickness of the<br />\nmakeup, and the nauseatingly<br />\nfashionable dress of these<br />\nself-styled women<br />\nrepresentatives.<br />\n<br />\napplications they submitted<br />\ncontaining their names and<br />\ndemographic details as well as the<br />\npolitical and civic activities that<br />\nthey have been involved in, plus a<br />\ndetailed biography.<br />\nThe Muskie people say they<br />\nare looking for community<br />\ninvolvement, good attitudes on<br />\nissues and great depth of \"Muskie<br />\nfeeling\" in a delegate. In search<br />\nof this last virtue, several delegate<br />\naspirants were heard chanting as<br />\nthey drove back to their<br />\ncommunities things like \"Ed<br />\nMuskie does resemble Abe<br />\nLincoln\" and \"Jane Muskie is the<br />\nfinest woman in the world.\" With<br />\nfans like these maybe Muskie<br />\ncould beat Nixon.<br />\n<br />\nTHE GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS<br />\nARE NOW IN MARYLAND.<br />\nApple.<br />\nIf we'd been<br />\naround a little<br />\nsooner, Adam<br />\nwouldn't have<br />\neaten an apple.

Exhibiting<br />\nboth teamwork and the<br />\nimportant stickhandling and<br />\npassing talents that were not yet<br />\nevident at this point last season,<br />\nthe Blue Jay offense was quite<br />\neffective against the Quakers.<br />\nCrease attackrnan Don Krohn<br />\nand midfielder Rick Kowalchuk<br />\neach earned hat tricks, scoring<br />\nthree goals apiece, and the six<br />\nassists by the team indicate skill<br />\nat hitting the open man.<br />\nImprovements in the defense<br />\nwere also apparent, as the player<br />\ncoverage and execution of slides<br />\nand shifts were sharper than the<br />\nweek before. Though they were<br />\nworking as a unit more<br />\nproficiently, the defense did<br />\nmake some costly errors due to<br />\nearly season lack of experience.<br />\nBut gaining valuable<br />\n<br />\nintercollegiate experience is<br />\nexactly. the purpose of these<br />\npre-season scrimmages.<br />\nPenalties<br />\nAn indication of the physical<br />\nnature of Saturday's game was<br />\nthe high occurence of penalties.<br />\nPenn, which tends to play a more<br />\nphysical brand of lacrosse, and<br />\nHopkins each sustained several<br />\nunnecessary fouls where<br />\nslash-happy players seemed a bit<br />\nanxious and overly aggressive, a<br />\nproblem of control which should<br />\nclear up as the season progresses.<br />\nWith the many penalties, an<br />\nunusually large proportion of the<br />\ngame was played with one team<br />\nhaving the man advantage. In<br />\nthese situations the Blue Jays<br />\ncapitalized more effectively,<br />\nscoring five power play goals<br />\nwhile thwarting the Quakers time<br />\nand again.<br />\nThe big difference in the<br />\nscrimmage, however, was in the<br />\nground ball coverage, which<br />\nHopkins dominated 74-37.<br />\n<br />\nJack Thomas eludes Penn defender in last Saturday's scrimmage.<br />\n<br />\nBRINGS RED BLOODED YOUTH<br />\n<br />\nLOVE AND PEACE<br />\n(or how a piece of the<br />\nbig action this summer<br />\ncan bring love all<br />\nyear 'round)<br />\n<br />\nScooping well at both ends of the<br />\nfield, the Blue Jays were thus<br />\nable to retain control of offense<br />\nand sucessfully complete clears<br />\nwhich had been broken. Mike<br />\nSiegert picked up several key<br />\ndefensive ground balls while<br />\nThomas converted several scoops<br />\ninto scoring plays. In the<br />\nmidfield the play of Eric<br />\nBergofsky and Kowalchuk was<br />\nanother asset for the team.<br />\nCatchup Lacrosse<br />\nFor the second time in as<br />\nmany scrimmages Hopkins found<br />\nitself playing catchup lacrosse<br />\nwithin the opening minute of<br />\nplay. Penn won the starting<br />\nface-off and scored in a mere 38<br />\nseconds. Hopkins then got<br />\nstarted and, with the Quakers a<br />\nman down, passes from<br />\nKowalchuk and Billy Nolan set<br />\nup Thomas to tie the score. Less<br />\nthan a minute later Nolan netted<br />\na cross body shot after coming<br />\naround from behind the goal. A<br />\nHopkins penalty then hurt as<br />\nPenn tallied on the uncontrolled<br />\nrebound following a picture save<br />\nby goalie Les Matthews. The Blue<br />\nJays continued their scoring<br />\ncrusade as Captain Gary<br />\nHandleman bounced home a<br />\nThomas feed by the Quaker<br />\ngoalie, and Don Krohn scooped<br />\nan errant centering pass into the<br />\nnet, promptly doubling the<br />\nHopkins ;cad.<br />\nIn a replay of the start of the<br />\ngame, Penn took the second<br />\nquarter face-off straight to the<br />\ngoal, making the score 4-3 in<br />\nonly 36 seconds. Midway<br />\nthrough the period Matthews<br />\nmade another inspirational save<br />\n<br />\nVarsity lacrosse coach Robert Scott looks forward to a new season.<br />\nversion of a feed from Don<br />\nwhich was followed by three<br />\nKrohn. Matthews then came up<br />\nHopkins goals within a one<br />\nwith his most spectacular save of<br />\nminute stretch. With no more<br />\nscoring in the first half, Hopkins the day, when a Penn attaclunan<br />\ncame in all alone on a fast break<br />\nlead at the break 7-3.<br />\nThe Blue Jays dominated the from the restraining line, with<br />\nLes blocking the open shot. In<br />\nthird period both physically and<br />\nstatistically. The advantage was the period Hopkins outscored the<br />\nobvious as Hopkins grabbed 25 Quakers 5-2 with Kowalchuk<br />\nof the 30 ground balls credited, netting two, Winegrad getting his<br />\nand outshot the Quakers 17-6. In second on a Kowalchuk rebound,<br />\nfact, Matthews was only called and Krohn tallying his third after<br />\non to contend with 3 shots on a heads up play by Thomas.<br />\nThe scrimmage ended with<br />\ngoal, two of which were from<br />\nclose range by wide open both squads substituting freely to<br />\nallow the benches an opportunity<br />\nattackmen.<br />\nHopkins kept the pressure on to get intercollegiate experience.<br />\nthe Penn defense, and on a Fourth quarter scoring was<br />\nQuaker penalty three quick shots limited as much of the playing<br />\npreceded a Ken Winegrad con- action was in the midfield area.<br />\n<br />\n(Hey bub...<br />\nwant big action<br />\nthiS Summer?<br />\ncan get you<br />\none hundred<br />\nand forty five*<br />\nlove notes or<br />\nmore weekly<br />\n...less tmv<br />\n<br />\nyouth earn the<br />\nfull count at Good<br />\nH umor...nothing to<br />\nbuy,rent,spend .We<br />\nprovide everything<br />\n<br />\ncut ofcourse!<br />\n<br />\nor more!<br />\n<br />\nOut tout!

Though they were<br />\nworking as a unit more<br />\nproficiently, the defense did<br />\nmake some costly errors due to<br />\nearly season lack of experience.<br />\nBut gaining valuable<br /><br />\nintercollegiate experience is<br />\nexactly. the purpose of these<br />\npre-season scrimmages.<br />\nPenalties<br />\nAn indication of the physical<br />\nnature of Saturday's game was<br />\nthe high occurence of penalties.<br />\nPenn, which tends to play a more<br />\nphysical brand of lacrosse, and<br />\nHopkins each sustained several<br />\nunnecessary fouls where<br />\nslash-happy players seemed a bit<br />\nanxious and overly aggressive, a<br />\nproblem of control which should<br />\nclear up as the season progresses.<br />\nWith the many penalties, an<br />\nunusually large proportion of the<br />\ngame was played with one team<br />\nhaving the man advantage. In<br />\nthese situations the Blue Jays<br />\ncapitalized more effectively,<br />\nscoring five power play goals<br />\nwhile thwarting the Quakers time<br />\nand again.<br />\nThe big difference in the<br />\nscrimmage, however, was in the<br />\nground ball coverage, which<br />\nHopkins dominated 74-37.<br /><br />\nJack Thomas eludes Penn defender in last Saturday's scrimmage.<br /><br />\nBRINGS RED BLOODED YOUTH<br /><br />\nLOVE AND PEACE<br />\n(or how a piece of the<br />\nbig action this summer<br />\ncan bring love all<br />\nyear 'round)<br /><br />\nScooping well at both ends of the<br />\nfield, the Blue Jays were thus<br />\nable to retain control of offense<br />\nand sucessfully complete clears<br />\nwhich had been broken. Mike<br />\nSiegert picked up several key<br />\ndefensive ground balls while<br />\nThomas converted several scoops<br />\ninto scoring plays. In the<br />\nmidfield the play of Eric<br />\nBergofsky and Kowalchuk was<br />\nanother asset for the team.<br />\nCatchup Lacrosse<br />\nFor the second time in as<br />\nmany scrimmages Hopkins found<br />\nitself playing catchup lacrosse<br />\nwithin the opening minute of<br />\nplay. Penn won the starting<br />\nface-off and scored in a mere 38<br />\nseconds. Hopkins then got<br />\nstarted and, with the Quakers a<br />\nman down, passes from<br />\nKowalchuk and Billy Nolan set<br />\nup Thomas to tie the score. Less<br />\nthan a minute later Nolan netted<br />\na cross body shot after coming<br />\naround from behind the goal. A<br />\nHopkins penalty then hurt as<br />\nPenn tallied on the uncontrolled<br />\nrebound following a picture save<br />\nby goalie Les Matthews. The Blue<br />\nJays continued their scoring<br />\ncrusade as Captain Gary<br />\nHandleman bounced home a<br />\nThomas feed by the Quaker<br />\ngoalie, and Don Krohn scooped<br />\nan errant centering pass into the<br />\nnet, promptly doubling the<br />\nHopkins ;cad.<br />\nIn a replay of the start of the<br />\ngame, Penn took the second<br />\nquarter face-off straight to the<br />\ngoal, making the score 4-3 in<br />\nonly 36 seconds.
