Arthur<br />\n<br />\nOf Rights And Responsibilities<br />\nWith the intention of correcting what Dr. William<br />\n-\"Kelso Morrill, Dean of Students, and some members of<br />\nthe student body consider an unfair practice, the Student<br />\nCouncil passed a motion Tuesday which \"recommended\"<br />\nthat any motion introduced in a class meeting to increase<br />\ndues or otherwise assess the members be tabled until the<br />\nfollowing week and that all members of the class be<br />\n\"properly notified\" of the meeting and the proposed<br />\nbusiness.<br />\n<br />\nFictitious Fraternity Dupes Frosh<br />\nTwo weeks ago, when rushing<br />\nbegan in the dormitories, various<br />\nfreshmen were confronted with<br />\nan incredible circumstance: on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus was a fraterity, of fictitious character not<br />\nknown to the freshmen at the<br />\ntime, offering them a fraternity<br />\nlife that could only have been<br />\ndescribed as a perfect Utopia.<br />\n<br />\nThe policy of the individual classes has been to duly<br />\nannounce all class meetings to the members of the class<br />\nand to vote any additions in class dues at these open<br />\nmeetings, at which any member may voice any objections<br />\nhe might have. This was the method by which the<br />\nUniversity Prom was financed last year.<br />\nHowever, recent actions by the sophomore and senior<br />\nclasses have precipitated disapproval by the Dean. At<br />\nits last meeting, the senior class voted unanimously to<br />\nunderwrite its share of the YMCA sponsored jazz concert.<br />\n<br />\nIt all began with the bewilderment of certain fraternity members when they saw several GDI's<br />\nengaging in various acts that<br />\nrepresented the dignified routine of rushing. The only real<br />\nobstacle that hindered these \"respectable\" rushers was that they<br />\npossessed no fraternity calling<br />\ncards, and when the situation<br />\narose to where the freshmen attempted to look up the particular<br />\nfraternity in their Johns Hopkins Handbook, they were told<br />\nthat by some mistake the editor<br />\nof the handbook had omitted the<br />\npage of this well known and<br />\ndeeply loved fraternal organization.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Morrill gave two reasons for objecting to this<br />\naction. First of all, he stated, \"I don't think that forty<br />\npeople have the right to assess three hundred people.\"<br />\nHis second consideration was the inconvenience to the<br />\nregistrar and the treasurer's office and the complaints by<br />\nparents of dues being charged in excess of the amount<br />\nstated in the University circular.<br />\nIn reference to the raising of dues to finance the<br />\nUniversity Prom, the Dean said, \"I went along with you<br />\non that.\" However, concerning the underwriting of the<br />\njazz concert, Dr. Morrill stated, \"I don't see why this<br />\nparticular project is that necessary.\"<br />\nSeveral facts need to be elucidated: Forty members<br />\npresent is a relatively large turnout for a senior class<br />\nmeeting. No assessment was voted\u2014the class merely<br />\ndecided that, should the jazz concert lose any money, it<br />\nwould assume its proportional share of any loss incurred,<br />\nsuch an amount not to exceed one dollar per man. We<br />\ncan see no valid reason for making a statement in the<br />\ncircular of the precise amount of class dues, but, instead,<br />\nan approximate amount should be given with the indicated stipulation that each class may tax itself as it sees<br />\nfit. Furthermore, it is the people at the class meetings<br />\nwho are the interested members of the class, and, we<br />\nfeel, along with a student's right to have a say in his<br />\nclass affairs goes the concomitant responsibility to at<br />\nleast attend the meetings.<br />\n<br />\n\"Safety Rushing\"<br />\nIt is an unfortunate fact that the return of fraternity<br />\nrushing again has brought to Hopkins its annual period<br />\nof dishonor.<br />\nFlagrant violations of rush rules are an annual occurrence which, by all appearances, everyone but the<br />\nNB is aware of and which, concurrently, no one seems<br />\nto give a twopenny damn about.<br />\nLast year the News-Letter called this sort of thing<br />\n\"slander rushing.\" This year the term \"safety rushing\"<br />\nis more appropriate in view of the type of violations being<br />\ncommitted. The new 8 o'clock curfew on fraternityfreshmen interlocution is completely ineffective--indeed<br />\nit is the opinion of more than a few Greeks that \"this rule<br />\nis ridiculous; therefore, we don't obey it\u2014why should<br />\nwe?\"<br />\n\"Safety rushing,\" though perhaps not a new concept<br />\ndue to the obvious unwillingness of fraternity men to<br />\nreport violations to the IFB, seems to have grown into<br />\nan unwieldy monster. The only sort of \"gentleman's<br />\nagreement\" that prevails any longer is the unwritten one<br />\nthat all fraternity men are one in blood and therefore<br />\nwill not report each other for violations.<br />\nIf this is massive retaliation against a \"distasteful\"<br />\nrush rule, why weren't objections raised beforehand?<br />\nMust honor be scuttled for the sake of inexpedient retortion and expedient slander?<br />\nIt seems this sort of editorial has become an annual<br />\nevent, and is seldom any more effective than the one<br />\nwhich preceded it. As we stated last week, the Honor<br />\nSystem is headed for Hades and a sputtering death at<br />\nthe present rate. Perhaps when the fraternity men mature enough to take a serious concept seriously the problem<br />\nWill have passed. Until then the dirt is self-perpetuating.<br />\n<br />\nAs the conversation proceeded,<br />\nthe gullible freshmen were led<br />\nto believe that the fraternity had<br />\nbeen given a loan of $100,000 by<br />\nits national for the purpose of<br />\nbuying and remodeling a mansion around the area of University Parkway. One freshman<br />\neven remarked that he had driven past a beautiful house that<br />\nwas being painted in that area.<br />\nand seemed quite impressed that<br />\na Hopkins fraternity could afford<br />\nsuch a house.<br />\n<br />\nTexas millionaires, had established the fund for this expressed<br />\npurpose. Since this particular<br />\nrushee happened to be from<br />\nTexas, the situation for the<br />\n\"honorable\" rushers continued<br />\nwithout further inquiries along<br />\nthis line,<br />\nBrains Go To Europe<br />\nBut not only did this fraternity<br />\noffer a spacious and beautified<br />\nhouse rooming 40 distinguished<br />\nbrothers, it also had the distinetion of offering a $600 scholarship to one sophomore in each<br />\nAnd<br />\nforthcoming pledge class.<br />\nnot only did it offer a scholarship, but one alumnus had given<br />\na large sum of money to the fraternity in order that four boys<br />\nof .outstanding,scholarship could<br />\nstudy in Europe between their<br />\njunior and senior years.<br />\n<br />\nthe freshmen in regard to<br />\nimprovised fraternity.<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nObeyed Rush Rules Strictly<br />\nIt was the original intention<br />\nof the fictitious rushers to have<br />\ncontinued this situation to the<br />\nextent to having a pledge class,<br />\nbut because of the consequences<br />\nof embarassment for the freshmen involved, and the wrath of<br />\nW.K.M., all future plans were<br />\ndropped. In the interest of the<br />\nI.F.B., all rushing was conducted<br />\nunder their regulations.<br />\n<br />\nIn view of the \"rushers\", the<br />\nhigh-light of their escapades took<br />\nplace after their rushing had<br />\nbeen concluded. One of them<br />\nwas relating the evening experiences to one of his GDI friends,<br />\nwhen a bonafide fraternity rusher walked past the room and<br />\nsaw the well-dressed young man<br />\nWhen the question of social talking to his friend.<br />\nlife was raised to the \"dubious\"<br />\nThe rusher immediately enrushers, they informed the fresh- tered the room and explained to<br />\nmen that parties were regular the GDI that rushing could not<br />\nevents, but that the Christmas be conducted after 10 p.m., and<br />\nparty in particular, was the out- said that he would not make a<br />\nstanding feature of the frater- report to the I.F.B. if the GDI<br />\nnity.

Arthur<br /><br />\nOf Rights And Responsibilities<br />\nWith the intention of correcting what Dr. William<br />\n-\"Kelso Morrill, Dean of Students, and some members of<br />\nthe student body consider an unfair practice, the Student<br />\nCouncil passed a motion Tuesday which \"recommended\"<br />\nthat any motion introduced in a class meeting to increase<br />\ndues or otherwise assess the members be tabled until the<br />\nfollowing week and that all members of the class be<br />\n\"properly notified\" of the meeting and the proposed<br />\nbusiness.<br /><br />\nFictitious Fraternity Dupes Frosh<br />\nTwo weeks ago, when rushing<br />\nbegan in the dormitories, various<br />\nfreshmen were confronted with<br />\nan incredible circumstance: on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus was a fraterity, of fictitious character not<br />\nknown to the freshmen at the<br />\ntime, offering them a fraternity<br />\nlife that could only have been<br />\ndescribed as a perfect Utopia.<br /><br />\nThe policy of the individual classes has been to duly<br />\nannounce all class meetings to the members of the class<br />\nand to vote any additions in class dues at these open<br />\nmeetings, at which any member may voice any objections<br />\nhe might have. This was the method by which the<br />\nUniversity Prom was financed last year.<br />\nHowever, recent actions by the sophomore and senior<br />\nclasses have precipitated disapproval by the Dean. At<br />\nits last meeting, the senior class voted unanimously to<br />\nunderwrite its share of the YMCA sponsored jazz concert.<br /><br />\nIt all began with the bewilderment of certain fraternity members when they saw several GDI's<br />\nengaging in various acts that<br />\nrepresented the dignified routine of rushing. The only real<br />\nobstacle that hindered these \"respectable\" rushers was that they<br />\npossessed no fraternity calling<br />\ncards, and when the situation<br />\narose to where the freshmen attempted to look up the particular<br />\nfraternity in their Johns Hopkins Handbook, they were told<br />\nthat by some mistake the editor<br />\nof the handbook had omitted the<br />\npage of this well known and<br />\ndeeply loved fraternal organization.<br /><br />\nDr. Morrill gave two reasons for objecting to this<br />\naction. First of all, he stated, \"I don't think that forty<br />\npeople have the right to assess three hundred people.\"<br />\nHis second consideration was the inconvenience to the<br />\nregistrar and the treasurer's office and the complaints by<br />\nparents of dues being charged in excess of the amount<br />\nstated in the University circular.<br />\nIn reference to the raising of dues to finance the<br />\nUniversity Prom, the Dean said, \"I went along with you<br />\non that.\" However, concerning the underwriting of the<br />\njazz concert, Dr. Morrill stated, \"I don't see why this<br />\nparticular project is that necessary.\"<br />\nSeveral facts need to be elucidated: Forty members<br />\npresent is a relatively large turnout for a senior class<br />\nmeeting. No assessment was voted\u2014the class merely<br />\ndecided that, should the jazz concert lose any money, it<br />\nwould assume its proportional share of any loss incurred,<br />\nsuch an amount not to exceed one dollar per man. We<br />\ncan see no valid reason for making a statement in the<br />\ncircular of the precise amount of class dues, but, instead,<br />\nan approximate amount should be given with the indicated stipulation that each class may tax itself as it sees<br />\nfit. Furthermore, it is the people at the class meetings<br />\nwho are the interested members of the class, and, we<br />\nfeel, along with a student's right to have a say in his<br />\nclass affairs goes the concomitant responsibility to at<br />\nleast attend the meetings.<br /><br />\n\"Safety Rushing\"<br />\nIt is an unfortunate fact that the return of fraternity<br />\nrushing again has brought to Hopkins its annual period<br />\nof dishonor.<br />\nFlagrant violations of rush rules are an annual occurrence which, by all appearances, everyone but the<br />\nNB is aware of and which, concurrently, no one seems<br />\nto give a twopenny damn about.<br />\nLast year the News-Letter called this sort of thing<br />\n\"slander rushing.\" This year the term \"safety rushing\"<br />\nis more appropriate in view of the type of violations being<br />\ncommitted. The new 8 o'clock curfew on fraternityfreshmen interlocution is completely ineffective--indeed<br />\nit is the opinion of more than a few Greeks that \"this rule<br />\nis ridiculous; therefore, we don't obey it\u2014why should<br />\nwe?\"<br />\n\"Safety rushing,\" though perhaps not a new concept<br />\ndue to the obvious unwillingness of fraternity men to<br />\nreport violations to the IFB, seems to have grown into<br />\nan unwieldy monster. The only sort of \"gentleman's<br />\nagreement\" that prevails any longer is the unwritten one<br />\nthat all fraternity men are one in blood and therefore<br />\nwill not report each other for violations.<br />\nIf this is massive retaliation against a \"distasteful\"<br />\nrush rule, why weren't objections raised beforehand?<br />\nMust honor be scuttled for the sake of inexpedient retortion and expedient slander?<br />\nIt seems this sort of editorial has become an annual<br />\nevent, and is seldom any more effective than the one<br />\nwhich preceded it. As we stated last week, the Honor<br />\nSystem is headed for Hades and a sputtering death at<br />\nthe present rate. Perhaps when the fraternity men mature enough to take a serious concept seriously the problem<br />\nWill have passed. Until then the dirt is self-perpetuating.<br /><br />\nAs the conversation proceeded,<br />\nthe gullible freshmen were led<br />\nto believe that the fraternity had<br />\nbeen given a loan of $100,000 by<br />\nits national for the purpose of<br />\nbuying and remodeling a mansion around the area of University Parkway. One freshman<br />\neven remarked that he had driven past a beautiful house that<br />\nwas being painted in that area.<br />\nand seemed quite impressed that<br />\na Hopkins fraternity could afford<br />\nsuch a house.<br /><br />\nTexas millionaires, had established the fund for this expressed<br />\npurpose. Since this particular<br />\nrushee happened to be from<br />\nTexas, the situation for the<br />\n\"honorable\" rushers continued<br />\nwithout further inquiries along<br />\nthis line,<br />\nBrains Go To Europe<br />\nBut not only did this fraternity<br />\noffer a spacious and beautified<br />\nhouse rooming 40 distinguished<br />\nbrothers, it also had the distinetion of offering a $600 scholarship to one sophomore in each<br />\nAnd<br />\nforthcoming pledge class.<br />\nnot only did it offer a scholarship, but one alumnus had given<br />\na large sum of money to the fraternity in order that four boys<br />\nof .outstanding,scholarship could<br />\nstudy in Europe between their<br />\njunior and senior years.<br /><br />\nthe freshmen in regard to<br />\nimprovised fraternity.<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nObeyed Rush Rules Strictly<br />\nIt was the original intention<br />\nof the fictitious rushers to have<br />\ncontinued this situation to the<br />\nextent to having a pledge class,<br />\nbut because of the consequences<br />\nof embarassment for the freshmen involved, and the wrath of<br />\nW.K.M., all future plans were<br />\ndropped. In the interest of the<br />\nI.F.B., all rushing was conducted<br />\nunder their regulations.<br /><br />\nIn view of the \"rushers\", the<br />\nhigh-light of their escapades took<br />\nplace after their rushing had<br />\nbeen concluded. One of them<br />\nwas relating the evening experiences to one of his GDI friends,<br />\nwhen a bonafide fraternity rusher walked past the room and<br />\nsaw the well-dressed young man<br />\nWhen the question of social talking to his friend.<br />\nlife was raised to the \"dubious\"<br />\nThe rusher immediately enrushers, they informed the fresh- tered the room and explained to<br />\nmen that parties were regular the GDI that rushing could not<br />\nevents, but that the Christmas be conducted after 10 p.m., and<br />\nparty in particular, was the out- said that he would not make a<br />\nstanding feature of the frater- report to the I.F.B. if the GDI<br />\nnity.
