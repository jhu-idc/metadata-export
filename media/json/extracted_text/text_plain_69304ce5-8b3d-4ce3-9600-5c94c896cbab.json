The query is interesting, not because of possessing any originality but because it is one which<br />\nnumerous simple-hearted lads have advanced with<br />\nvarying degrees of temerity.<br />\nWe don't know of anybody on the campus who<br />\npretends that the plan is fair. The whole matter,<br />\nbriefly, is this: creditors not paid last semester because of the bank closing raised such a holler when<br />\nactivities fees were collected this year that they had to<br />\nbe paid before we could go on with anything else.<br />\nThis took over half of our money. Assuming that<br />\nactivities are necessary and that the students want<br />\nthem (pity THE NEWS-LETTER if they don't), the only<br />\nway that any operations were possible at all was to<br />\ndisregard the principle of the thing entirely and soak<br />\na nominal tax additionally upon each student.<br />\nThere's no element of justice or defensible principle in the action; it's merely a question of expediency. It might even be asked, What-right has the<br />\nUniversity to take $1,000 out of the S. A. fee collections as an assessment for overhead expense; is this<br />\nnot a misappropriation of funds when the University<br />\nthereby repudiates its obligation of supylying the benefits of the activities without further charge?<br />\nIt's a nice ethical mess.

But he did say that paying athletes openly<br />\n(italics our own) would ruin football.<br />\nThere's diplomacy for you; there's consummately<br />\nskillful smoothing over of a bad situation. We imagine that all the coaches just looked relieved, nudged<br />\neach other, and said \"Good old Fritz! Always says<br />\nthe right thing at the right time.

The query is interesting, not because of possessing any originality but because it is one which<br />\nnumerous simple-hearted lads have advanced with<br />\nvarying degrees of temerity.<br />\nWe don't know of anybody on the campus who<br />\npretends that the plan is fair. The whole matter,<br />\nbriefly, is this: creditors not paid last semester because of the bank closing raised such a holler when<br />\nactivities fees were collected this year that they had to<br />\nbe paid before we could go on with anything else.<br />\nThis took over half of our money. Assuming that<br />\nactivities are necessary and that the students want<br />\nthem (pity THE NEWS-LETTER if they don't), the only<br />\nway that any operations were possible at all was to<br />\ndisregard the principle of the thing entirely and soak<br />\na nominal tax additionally upon each student.<br />\nThere's no element of justice or defensible principle in the action; it's merely a question of expediency. It might even be asked, What-right has the<br />\nUniversity to take $1,000 out of the S. A. fee collections as an assessment for overhead expense; is this<br />\nnot a misappropriation of funds when the University<br />\nthereby repudiates its obligation of supylying the benefits of the activities without further charge?<br />\nIt's a nice ethical mess. We're simply puddling<br />\nalong, blundering frightfully, but doing the best possible under the circumstances. If some wizard will<br />\nsuggest the solution nobody's going to snub him. The<br />\nonly thing that seems immediately incumbent upon<br />\nthe authorities is to apply the money which they have<br />\nderived from partially reopened accounts in the channels which will most recompense the student for his<br />\nten-dollar outlay. Dean Berry has promised to pay<br />\noff after the first of February and we have no reason<br />\nto believe that he won't, considering that he has the<br />\nmoney.<br /><br />\nThe Secret Of Success<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n\"College Coaches Oppose Proselyting, Pay to<br />\nAthletes,\" headline on short article in local paper<br />\nreferring to a resolution passed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association at its recent Chicago<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nAmazement seized us bodily. (There's vividness<br /><br />\nfor you.) What will happen to the grand old game<br />\nof football 'now, we remorsed. Only three men in<br />\nthe group of 150 coaches, the article said, favored any<br />\nform of paying athletes. Of course all the others,<br />\nmore willing to be transcendently noble than just plain<br />\nhonest, just glared at the three worms (we imagine),<br />\nand shouted that they would not have it. No, they'd<br />\nlose their jobs rather than pay or proselyte an athlete.<br />\nBut with the game of the gods tottering on the<br />\nbrink of destruction; with the sport of manhood on<br />\nthe verge of being immolated for the sake of a highsounding principle and a feeling of nobility which had<br />\nseized the coaches unawares and which now rather<br />\nfrightened them, one of the old guard rushed in to<br />\nsave the day. And who was that? None other than<br />\nthe maestro of mentors, Fritz Crisler of Princeton,<br />\nwho was doubtless motivated by remembering that if<br />\nhe lost his job why, after all, you know, there are the<br />\nwife and kiddies.<br />\nHe probably thumped the table; we don't know<br />\nbecause we weren't there and the writer of the article<br />\nomitted to say. He probably said, \"Gentlemen, you're<br />\nright. The escutcheon of sports must not be sullied<br />\nby the bar sinister of professionalism !\" The article<br />\nleaves us to the resources of our own imagination<br />\nthere, too. But he did say that paying athletes openly<br />\n(italics our own) would ruin football.<br />\nThere's diplomacy for you; there's consummately<br />\nskillful smoothing over of a bad situation. We imagine that all the coaches just looked relieved, nudged<br />\neach other, and said \"Good old Fritz! Always says<br />\nthe right thing at the right time. They'll never catch<br />\nold Fritz.\" And the reporter, anxious to do what was<br />\nright, gave Fritz the credit for having saved the day<br />\nfor Coachdom.<br />\nGee, ain't it wonderful!<br /><br />\nIntercollegiate News<br />\nThe feminine attendance at a certain professor's<br />\nSaturday morning sociology class at Lehigh was not<br />\nlarge enough to warrant the professor's annual discussion of the education of wOmen, but he did stop<br />\nto mention that Vassar was founded by a brewer who<br />\nwas trying to prove that women really could be<br />\neducated.<br />\n* * *<br />\nOne Protestant student at Lehigh was very much<br />\nembarrassed when he awoke one Sunday morning to<br />\nfind himself in evening clothes at Catholic mass.<br />\n* * *<br />\nRumor has it that at the University of Minnesota<br />\none out of every 20 girls paints her toe nails.<br />\n* * *<br />\nAt the University of Florida exactly thirty-nine<br />\nfreshmen were promised the freshman class presidency<br />\nduring the active campaigning of \"rush week\".<br />\n* * *<br />\nA questionnaire reveals that 298 of the class of<br />\n1937 came to Princeton for an education, 179 because of the University's name and reputation, and<br />\n70 for contacts and social advantages.<br />\n* * *<br />\ntape were used to bind up<br />\nof<br />\nFifty-four miles<br />\nthe football players at the University of California<br />\nduring the last season.<br />\nEnrollment at the University of Detroit shows<br />\nthat 3,543 women and only 77 men attend the school\u2014<br />\nwhat a school!<br />\n* * *<br />\nSomething new in football\u2014at Ohio State University there is a twelfth position on the football team.<br />\nThe extra man is called the \"humorist\".

We use only<br />\nthe center leaves of the finest Turkish and domestic tobacco plants. Not the top leaves\u2014because those are underdeveloped. Not the bottom leaves\u2014because those are inferior in quality. We use only the center leaves\u2014because<br />\nthese are the mildest leaves\u2014fully ripe for perfect smoking. Only these choice tobaccos are used to make Luckies<br />\n\u2014so round, so firm, so fully packed\u2014 and no loose ends<br />\nto spill out. That's why Luckies are always mild and<br />\nsmooth. That's why always \"Luckies please\".
