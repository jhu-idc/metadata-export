SPIVITZ<br />\nThe conflict between a dashing and popular British officer<br />\nand his jealous and naturally unpopular commanding officer is the<br />\nbasic theme of \"Court Martial,\"<br />\nthe film currently being shown at<br />\nthe Playhouse. Complicating matters is the mutual attraction of<br />\nthe officer, Major Karrington,<br />\nV.C., played by David Niven, and<br />\none Captain Allison Graham (female), and the Major's feeling of<br />\nresponsibility to his unhappy, neurotic wife.<br />\nThe Commanding Officer<br />\nColonel Hanniker, Alan Cuthbertson, would be the perfect villain<br />\n<br />\nfor any picture were he to sport<br />\na weighty black moustache. Having been confined to a training<br />\ncenter during World War II, while<br />\nKarington was off winning citations for bravery, courage, and<br />\nvarious other lauditory characteristics, the Colonel is depicted as<br />\nbeing \"out to get\" the hero.<br />\nHe gets his chance when Karrington clips one hundred pounds<br />\nor so from the company strongbox, goes AWOL, and is discovered with Captain Graham in his<br />\nquarters in wreckless abandon to<br />\nthe rules. Naturally, the Colonel<br />\nwastes no time in getting the<br />\ncourt martial proceedings in motion.<br />\n<br />\nVarious proceedings of the trial<br />\nitself are interesting, and even<br />\nsomewhat enjoyable. Attempts at<br />\ncomedy are successful about fifty<br />\nper cent of the time, which is below average for the best British<br />\nfilms, but generally above par.<br />\nThe proceedings of the trial<br />\nbring ot4t the problems which have<br />\nbeen facing Karrington, separate<br />\nhim permanently from his wife,<br />\nand ultimately promise to make<br />\nhis relationship with Captain<br />\nGraham legal. As is the case in<br />\nmost pictures, the end comes with<br />\nthe expectation that \"the good<br />\nguys will win out after all.\"<br />\nTechnically, the film did not<br />\n<br />\nPlan To Type Blood.<br />\nSuggested By APO<br />\nCharles Burton, president of the<br />\nHopkins chapter of Alpha phi<br />\nOmega, national honorary BO<br />\nScout fraternity, disclosed Plans<br />\nto \"canvass the dormitories\" to<br />\ntake blood types of all students<br />\nwho wish to be typed.

With both the football and the<br />\nsoccer teams winning, we have for the first time this year<br />\nvictories in both the major fall sports.<br />\nHats off to Mickey Cochrane and his fine soccer team.<br />\nAlthough posting a losing 2-4-1 record, the team has looked<br />\nwell in all their games against quite stiff opposition. Last<br />\nweekend, they defeated a good Washington College team 1-0,<br />\nunder the handicap of a high wind. Endy China, a sophomore,<br />\nplayed a great game at goal.<br />\nPersonnel Big Problem<br />\nPersonnel is the big problem for Bridgers, both in quantiy, expe-fience, and ability. Although he has some very good<br />\nboys on the team, as on any team, not every one is of equal<br />\nability, and inasmuch as Hopkins doesn't emphasize athletics,<br />\n, it doesn't attract a lot of topflight football players who can<br />\nobtain athletic scholarships from other schools.<br />\nHopkins also presents many obstacles like limited time<br />\nto practiee, which hampers Bridgers a great deal since he<br />\ndoesn't have an abundance of experienced material with which<br />\nto work. It is very difficult to teach football in six hours a week<br />\nwith only three week& of pre-season practice and no spring<br />\npractice. Having to use some boys with limited experience, it<br />\nis also extremely difficult to instruct the boys sufficiently so<br />\nas not to make so many mistakes.<br />\nThree Linemen Tops<br />\nA team is only as good as its weakest man, and even<br />\nthough Bridgers feels that he has one of the best guards,<br />\ntackles, and centers he has seen,.in Sam Wright, Ken McGraw, and Don Gallagher, respectively, that does not make<br />\nan eleven man team. There are other good boys than those<br />\nnamed, although these three stand out, but there just aren't<br />\nenough. Most of the boys don't have time to be developed<br />\nfully, for many of them play only one or two years for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWe sympathize with Bridgers and the handicaps which he<br />\nand the team faces and we laud the boys who work on the<br />\nteam, win or lose. We feel that the personnel and limited practice time are the two big factors in Hopkins' lack of success,<br />\nnot, as some apparently gathered from last week, that the<br />\n\"T\" formation is a cure-all. On the other hand, we are convinced that our suggestions of last week in regard to the \"T\"<br />\nformation are valid and that the \"T\" has definite value.<br />\n<br />\nBy BOB MARTINI<br />\nFresh from their first victory<br />\nOf the season, a 19-6 conquest of<br />\nSwarthmore, the Hopkins cridders<br />\nmeet Dickinson College for the<br />\nRed Devils' Homecoming game<br />\ntomorrow at Carlisle, Pa.<br />\nDickinson, a team with an entirely new coaching staff, has so<br />\nfar this year compiled a one-win,<br />\nsix-loss record.

It includes also the freedom to act individually, to find one's own academic and social level and follow it to its responsible end\u2014the emergence of' a complete,<br />\nself-thinking, analytical being.<br />\nThe happy uniqueness, or at least unusualness, of Hopkin's atmosphere of freedom has seldom been pointed out so<br />\nstrikingly as in the past week, when an all-inclusive ban on<br />\nliquor on campus was placed on the University of Maryland.<br />\nSuch a blatant violation of the rights of the individual<br />\nis shocking; the possibility of such a situation ever occurring<br />\nat The Hopkins, frightening.<br />\nBut if an important part of the Hopkins freedom does<br />\ndisappear\u2014for instance, the right to be governed by soundthinking, intelligent student representatives\u2014the blame will<br />\nlie on the heads of those students who do not realize that<br />\nfreedom is a responsibility as well as a right and a privilege.<br />\nIn his statement concerning the recent invalidated Student<br />\nCouncil elections (page 1), Student Council President Bob<br />\nPeinado made the statement that at the Hopkins it is taken<br />\nfor granted that no false candidate would be run for office.<br />\nEarlier in the statement Peinado said that it is the responsibility of the voters to vote intelligently and that the \"Bob<br />\nClarke\" incident proved that such intelligent voting does<br />\nnot always exist.<br />\nWe agree heartily with his latter statement, but take<br />\nissue with the former.

SPIVITZ<br />\nThe conflict between a dashing and popular British officer<br />\nand his jealous and naturally unpopular commanding officer is the<br />\nbasic theme of \"Court Martial,\"<br />\nthe film currently being shown at<br />\nthe Playhouse. Complicating matters is the mutual attraction of<br />\nthe officer, Major Karrington,<br />\nV.C., played by David Niven, and<br />\none Captain Allison Graham (female), and the Major's feeling of<br />\nresponsibility to his unhappy, neurotic wife.<br />\nThe Commanding Officer<br />\nColonel Hanniker, Alan Cuthbertson, would be the perfect villain<br /><br />\nfor any picture were he to sport<br />\na weighty black moustache.

Attempts at<br />\ncomedy are successful about fifty<br />\nper cent of the time, which is below average for the best British<br />\nfilms, but generally above par.<br />\nThe proceedings of the trial<br />\nbring ot4t the problems which have<br />\nbeen facing Karrington, separate<br />\nhim permanently from his wife,<br />\nand ultimately promise to make<br />\nhis relationship with Captain<br />\nGraham legal.

With both the football and the<br />\nsoccer teams winning, we have for the first time this year<br />\nvictories in both the major fall sports.<br />\nHats off to Mickey Cochrane and his fine soccer team.<br />\nAlthough posting a losing 2-4-1 record, the team has looked<br />\nwell in all their games against quite stiff opposition. Last<br />\nweekend, they defeated a good Washington College team 1-0,<br />\nunder the handicap of a high wind. Endy China, a sophomore,<br />\nplayed a great game at goal.<br />\nPersonnel Big Problem<br />\nPersonnel is the big problem for Bridgers, both in quantiy, expe-fience, and ability. Although he has some very good<br />\nboys on the team, as on any team, not every one is of equal<br />\nability, and inasmuch as Hopkins doesn't emphasize athletics,<br />\n, it doesn't attract a lot of topflight football players who can<br />\nobtain athletic scholarships from other schools.<br />\nHopkins also presents many obstacles like limited time<br />\nto practiee, which hampers Bridgers a great deal since he<br />\ndoesn't have an abundance of experienced material with which<br />\nto work. It is very difficult to teach football in six hours a week<br />\nwith only three week&amp; of pre-season practice and no spring<br />\npractice. Having to use some boys with limited experience, it<br />\nis also extremely difficult to instruct the boys sufficiently so<br />\nas not to make so many mistakes.<br />\nThree Linemen Tops<br />\nA team is only as good as its weakest man, and even<br />\nthough Bridgers feels that he has one of the best guards,<br />\ntackles, and centers he has seen,.in Sam Wright, Ken McGraw, and Don Gallagher, respectively, that does not make<br />\nan eleven man team. There are other good boys than those<br />\nnamed, although these three stand out, but there just aren't<br />\nenough. Most of the boys don't have time to be developed<br />\nfully, for many of them play only one or two years for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWe sympathize with Bridgers and the handicaps which he<br />\nand the team faces and we laud the boys who work on the<br />\nteam, win or lose. We feel that the personnel and limited practice time are the two big factors in Hopkins' lack of success,<br />\nnot, as some apparently gathered from last week, that the<br />\n\"T\" formation is a cure-all. On the other hand, we are convinced that our suggestions of last week in regard to the \"T\"<br />\nformation are valid and that the \"T\" has definite value.<br /><br />\nBy BOB MARTINI<br />\nFresh from their first victory<br />\nOf the season, a 19-6 conquest of<br />\nSwarthmore, the Hopkins cridders<br />\nmeet Dickinson College for the<br />\nRed Devils' Homecoming game<br />\ntomorrow at Carlisle, Pa.<br />\nDickinson, a team with an entirely new coaching staff, has so<br />\nfar this year compiled a one-win,<br />\nsix-loss record.
