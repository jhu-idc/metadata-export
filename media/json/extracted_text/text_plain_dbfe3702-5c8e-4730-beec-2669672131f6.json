The issue was military<br />\nrecruiting, part of our anger at a devastating and insane<br />\nwar, and tents, dope and music blossomed on the lawn<br />\nbehind Homewood House, a sustenance for radicals in<br />\nthe long wait for the important new week ahead. By midweek, a significant portion of the usually apathetic<br />\nHomewood community had rallied to the anti-military<br />\ncause, and a successful student strike was launched.<br />\nTwo days later, the strike ended, with an agreement on<br />\nmilitary recruiting--and the radicals tricked into<br />\nbelieving that negotiations would continue on other<br />\ndemands. Although the military would be voted off<br />\ncampus a week later, something in the radical's spirit<br />\nwas broken by the realization that they had been fooled.<br />\nCambodia and Kent State soon exploded on campuses<br />\nthroughout the nation, a march on Washington was held,<br />\nbut here at Hopkins a slow deadening of the anti-war<br />\nforces began.<br />\nNationally, too, campuses have quieted down,<br />\nwelcome relief to college administrators and government officials.

The President is committed to<br />\nnothing less than an anti-Communist government in<br />\nSaigon, and further Vietnamization will likely prove<br />\neven more barbaric than our present policy, since<br />\nreliance on air power and the mad technology of<br />\ndefoliation and anti-personnel bombs will be greater.<br />\nOur present course will lead, at best, to Oriental corpses<br />\ninstead of American ones.<br />\nApril 24 there is a mass rally in Washington, and on<br />\nMay 3 there will be non-violent disruptions in that<br />\ncorrupted city, part of two weeks of, various anti-war<br />\nactivities.

The<br />\nother is performing its task right now; let us hope that it<br />\nmeets with greater success.<br />\nIn making its well-known survey for \"widespread<br />\ndissatisfaction,\" the Howard Committee found that the<br />\nbulk of the undergraduate discontent centered on the<br />\ncurriculum. And indeed the focus of most student<br />\nconcern this year has been on improvement of the<br />\ncourse offerings.

Others see<br />\ncourses of this type being<br />\nboth attractive and necessary<br />\nin light of the announced<br />\ntwenty-five percent increase<br />\nin the undergraduate student<br />\nbody.

Thus in<br />\nthis context and with a desire<br />\nto alleviate the tension, we<br />\nwould like to place before you<br />\nfor your consideration the<br />\nfollowing proposal:<br />\nNo student during his four<br />\n<br />\nyears of undergraduate study<br />\nmay take more than twelve<br />\n(12) credit-hours of nondepartmental Field Practicum studies counting<br />\ntoward the minimum of one<br />\nhundred and twenty (120)<br />\ndegree credits without the<br />\nexpress approval of the Dean<br />\nof Undergraduate Studies or<br />\nhis designate.\"<br />\n<br />\nWe feel that this proposal<br />\nacthe<br />\nfor<br />\nallows<br />\nall<br />\nof<br />\ncomm odation<br />\nviewpoints.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nAbram Kronberg<br />\nWilliam F.

The foundations for these<br />\ndevelopments were prepared by extensive<br />\nStudent Council activity.<br />\nThese breakthroughs suggest the question<br />\n\"How effective is the Student Council?\"<br />\nAlthough in the past the Student Council has<br />\nlacked credibility, in the last year and a half<br />\nit has begun to establish a reputation for<br />\neffectiveness. Even the News-Letter has<br />\nagreed that this year's Council has effectively attempted to improve the condition<br />\nof undergraduates.<br />\nAccording to the Student Council Constitution, the Council represents the<br />\n.students. This responsibility has structural<br />\nlimitations. The council is ideally suited to<br />\naccomplish some tasks, but for others it is<br />\nill-fitted to do the job.<br />\nThe first limitation is the lack of interest<br />\nthat hampers every representative body.<br />\nHopkins institutionalizes disinterest.<br />\nSeymour Lippset notes that liberal artshumanities students have the greatest<br />\ntendency to be student activists. Hopkins,<br />\nwith its scientific-engineering orientation,<br />\nhas few potential activists. And even this<br />\nminority feels the heavy academic competition that focuses attention away from the<br />\nextracurricular.<br />\nThe other structural limitation is housing.<br />\nHopkins, except for the freshman dorms,<br />\nlacks the community that is essential fq<br />\nnurture student activism. With contact<br />\nconfined to roommate(s) and neighboring<br />\nMartin Vogel is Secretary of the Student Council<br />\nand a candidate for Student Council President.<br />\nOther candidates are invited to use this space for<br />\nexpression of their :)iews.<br />\n<br />\nstudents lack opportunities to develop and<br />\nshare opinions on non-academic issues. The<br />\ndiffusion of upperclassmen throughout the<br />\narea and the gap between undergraduate<br />\nand graduate leave Hopkins without the<br />\nbreeding ground for activism.<br />\nPast Student Councils have touched on a<br />\nplethora of issues, sometimes going off on<br />\ntangential causes and ignoring followthrough. In 1969-70, the Student Council<br />\norganized Hopkins' participation in anti-war<br />\nactivities. Similar attempts, although in my<br />\nopinion necessary, have not always succeeded. The broad base of representation,<br />\ndifferences of opinion on tactics, and<br />\nexisting commitments make the Council illsuited to handle such involvements.<br />\nAlthough the Council may share its human<br />\nand financial resources, an organized ad-hoc<br />\ngroup can do a more thorough job to advance<br />\na specific cause.<br />\nOne reason for the success of this year's<br />\nCouncil has been the limited focus-primarily on social life, governance, and<br />\neducation. These issues, all with great impact for undergraduates, do not insure<br />\nparticipation by more than a fraction of the<br />\nstudents but do provide the sympathetic<br />\nsupport that contributes to resolution of the<br />\nissues.<br />\nOne essential element of a campus community, a new Student Union, is at least ten<br />\nyears off. A council committee has worked<br />\non possibilities for a temporary Union and<br />\nhas come up with detailed blueprints and a<br />\nreport favoring Whitehead Hall. Efforts to<br />\nimplement this suggestion continue.<br />\nIn conclusion, any Student Council faces<br />\ninstitutional problems of limited interest and<br />\nlack of support. What is remarkable is that<br />\neven with these constraints the Council is<br />\nincreasing its effectiveness. Notably in<br />\nareas that relate directly to the students, i.e.<br />\ngovernance, social life, and education, the<br />\nCouncil has been the most effective voice for<br />\nimprovement<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nAPRIL 20, 1971<br />\n<br />\nse<br />\n'Ca<br />\ns<br />\nk<br />\nCite<br />\nBoo<br />\nty'<br />\nali<br />\nton<br />\nate<br />\nper<br />\ndes<br />\nt,<br />\nViolen<br />\n<br />\nfeiffer<br />\n<br />\nacross the room, with his back to the glass<br />\nwindow on the west.

When the<br />\nMets began the 1969 season, , the<br />\nmen-in-the-know laughed. And when<br />\nVirginia came to Homewood to play<br />\nJohns Hopkins in lacrosse, the<br />\nCavaliers were supposed to joke<br />\ntheir way to a 25-2 victory.<br />\nInstead the Blue Jays, armed with<br />\na masterful game plan, put forth a<br />\nnear-perfect effort and came within<br />\n2:23 of pulling off the upset of the<br />\nyear. The awesome firepower of the<br />\nVirginia attack, however, ultimately<br />\nproved to be the difference as the<br />\nCavaliers tallied twice in the second<br />\novertime period to eke out a 9-8<br />\nsqueaker in Saturday's lacrosse<br />\ncontest.<br />\nThe outcome marked a heartbreaking loss for a team that had<br />\ntwice rallied back from two goal<br />\ndeficits to lead a superb Virginia<br />\noutfit that was supposed to run them<br />\noff the field. With the score standing<br />\nat 7-5, in favor of the Cavaliers,<br />\n<br />\nmidway through the ,final period,<br />\nsophomore Don Krohn converted a<br />\nbeautiful pass from Bill Donovan to<br />\nclose the gap to one at 8:03. Eric<br />\nBergofsky tied up the score at seven<br />\napiece by ramming in a bazooka<br />\nshot at 10:42, Donovan assisting. The<br />\nregulation time expired without<br />\nanother score, sending the contest<br />\ninto one required overtime period<br />\ntoo many.<br />\nGoalie Ken Dauses got possession<br />\nof the ball early in the first overtime<br />\nand did an imitation of a statue<br />\nbehind the crease until the clock<br />\ncame on the field. With under a<br />\nminute remaining, Dauses started to<br />\nmove the ball upfield. Bedlam broke<br />\nloose when Dave Pickall put<br />\nHopkins on top with twenty-nine<br />\nseconds remaining.<br />\nIn the second overtime period, the<br />\nBlue Jays failed to do what everyone<br />\nknew was paramount, namely, to<br />\nkeep the ball away from Virginia's<br />\npotent attack. Then came some<br />\ndoubtful calls by the officials that<br />\nleft the Jays one man down for most<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nof the period. The most controversial was a \"spearing\" call on<br />\nDanny Hall. Doug Cooper tied up the<br />\ngame at 1:37 on a pass from allAmerican Tom Duquette, and Pete<br />\nEldredge's at 2:56 trickled through<br />\nDauses' legs into the net. The<br />\nCavaliers took the ensuing faceoff,<br />\nand the nation's number one-ranked<br />\nteam stalled the rest of the way to<br />\ntheir fifth straight win.<br />\nThe Virginia offense started out on<br />\nschedule by jumping on top in the<br />\nfirst ten seconds of play. Throughout<br />\nthe remainder of the first half,<br />\nhowever, it was all Hopkins. Coach<br />\nBob Scott unleased an unorthodox<br />\nstallball attack that saw Jay Hanas<br />\nand Danny Hall merely stand idly<br />\nwith the ball. It soon became evident<br />\nthat as long as Virginia didn't handle<br />\nthe ball, scoring was an impossibility. Don Krohn tied up the<br />\ngame on the Blue Jays' first shot of<br />\nthe game at 2:50, Hanas assisting.<br />\nBergofsky put Hopkins in front,<br />\n2-1, at 5:32, and Gary Handleman took a Hall pass at 10:16 and<br />\n<br />\nSPORTS<br />\n<br />\nJay Nine Gain First Place<br />\nBy BRUCE BORTZ<br />\n\"The game isn't over 'till<br />\nthe last man is out\" is undoubtedly the brainstorm of<br />\nsome<br />\ncliche-writer<br />\nof<br />\nyesteryear.

The issue was military<br />\nrecruiting, part of our anger at a devastating and insane<br />\nwar, and tents, dope and music blossomed on the lawn<br />\nbehind Homewood House, a sustenance for radicals in<br />\nthe long wait for the important new week ahead. By midweek, a significant portion of the usually apathetic<br />\nHomewood community had rallied to the anti-military<br />\ncause, and a successful student strike was launched.<br />\nTwo days later, the strike ended, with an agreement on<br />\nmilitary recruiting--and the radicals tricked into<br />\nbelieving that negotiations would continue on other<br />\ndemands.

One of those did its duty last summer, and<br />\nproduced the very disappointing governance report. The<br />\nother is performing its task right now; let us hope that it<br />\nmeets with greater success.<br />\nIn making its well-known survey for \"widespread<br />\ndissatisfaction,\" the Howard Committee found that the<br />\nbulk of the undergraduate discontent centered on the<br />\ncurriculum. And indeed the focus of most student<br />\nconcern this year has been on improvement of the<br />\ncourse offerings. But now, despite honest efforts by the<br />\nStudent Council and other interested parties, hopes for<br />\nsubstantive changes in this area rest with the Blue<br />\nRibbon Panel (BRP).<br />\nBut so far, we have heard little from this group.<br />\nThough the Academic Council has indicated that it is<br />\nwilling to listen and react to this committee's offerings,<br />\nmost of the changes in undergraduate education which<br />\nwe will see next September will come from the initiative<br />\nof the interim president.<br />\nLet us hope that this panel realizes the importance of<br />\nits mission, and, recognizing that it is possible for even a<br />\ngraduate-oriented Hopkins to offer a cohesive liberal<br />\narts education, leads the way to meaningful reform of<br />\nthe undergraduate program.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br /><br />\n\"The Pulse Beat Is Quickening\"<br /><br />\nListed below are excerpts from<br />\na letter sent to Dean Benton.<br />\nMuch controversy has,<br />\nduring the past few months,<br />\nbeen raging over the status<br />\nand supervision of Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire's nondepartmental course offerings in Field Practicum<br />\nstudies, and we have been<br />\ngreatly concerned. Many<br />\nstudents are worried that<br />\nthese courses, which they feel<br />\nare a necessary part of an<br />\neneducational<br />\nurban<br />\nenvironment, are going to be<br />\nterminated.

The foundations for these<br />\ndevelopments were prepared by extensive<br />\nStudent Council activity.<br />\nThese breakthroughs suggest the question<br />\n\"How effective is the Student Council?\"<br />\nAlthough in the past the Student Council has<br />\nlacked credibility, in the last year and a half<br />\nit has begun to establish a reputation for<br />\neffectiveness. Even the News-Letter has<br />\nagreed that this year's Council has effectively attempted to improve the condition<br />\nof undergraduates.<br />\nAccording to the Student Council Constitution, the Council represents the<br />\n.students. This responsibility has structural<br />\nlimitations. The council is ideally suited to<br />\naccomplish some tasks, but for others it is<br />\nill-fitted to do the job.<br />\nThe first limitation is the lack of interest<br />\nthat hampers every representative body.<br />\nHopkins institutionalizes disinterest.<br />\nSeymour Lippset notes that liberal artshumanities students have the greatest<br />\ntendency to be student activists. Hopkins,<br />\nwith its scientific-engineering orientation,<br />\nhas few potential activists. And even this<br />\nminority feels the heavy academic competition that focuses attention away from the<br />\nextracurricular.<br />\nThe other structural limitation is housing.<br />\nHopkins, except for the freshman dorms,<br />\nlacks the community that is essential fq<br />\nnurture student activism. With contact<br />\nconfined to roommate(s) and neighboring<br />\nMartin Vogel is Secretary of the Student Council<br />\nand a candidate for Student Council President.<br />\nOther candidates are invited to use this space for<br />\nexpression of their :)iews.<br /><br />\nstudents lack opportunities to develop and<br />\nshare opinions on non-academic issues. The<br />\ndiffusion of upperclassmen throughout the<br />\narea and the gap between undergraduate<br />\nand graduate leave Hopkins without the<br />\nbreeding ground for activism.<br />\nPast Student Councils have touched on a<br />\nplethora of issues, sometimes going off on<br />\ntangential causes and ignoring followthrough. In 1969-70, the Student Council<br />\norganized Hopkins' participation in anti-war<br />\nactivities. Similar attempts, although in my<br />\nopinion necessary, have not always succeeded. The broad base of representation,<br />\ndifferences of opinion on tactics, and<br />\nexisting commitments make the Council illsuited to handle such involvements.<br />\nAlthough the Council may share its human<br />\nand financial resources, an organized ad-hoc<br />\ngroup can do a more thorough job to advance<br />\na specific cause.<br />\nOne reason for the success of this year's<br />\nCouncil has been the limited focus-primarily on social life, governance, and<br />\neducation. These issues, all with great impact for undergraduates, do not insure<br />\nparticipation by more than a fraction of the<br />\nstudents but do provide the sympathetic<br />\nsupport that contributes to resolution of the<br />\nissues.<br />\nOne essential element of a campus community, a new Student Union, is at least ten<br />\nyears off. A council committee has worked<br />\non possibilities for a temporary Union and<br />\nhas come up with detailed blueprints and a<br />\nreport favoring Whitehead Hall. Efforts to<br />\nimplement this suggestion continue.<br />\nIn conclusion, any Student Council faces<br />\ninstitutional problems of limited interest and<br />\nlack of support. What is remarkable is that<br />\neven with these constraints the Council is<br />\nincreasing its effectiveness. Notably in<br />\nareas that relate directly to the students, i.e.<br />\ngovernance, social life, and education, the<br />\nCouncil has been the most effective voice for<br />\nimprovement<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nAPRIL 20, 1971<br /><br />\nse<br />\n'Ca<br />\ns<br />\nk<br />\nCite<br />\nBoo<br />\nty'<br />\nali<br />\nton<br />\nate<br />\nper<br />\ndes<br />\nt,<br />\nViolen<br /><br />\nfeiffer<br /><br />\nacross the room, with his back to the glass<br />\nwindow on the west.

According to the information about the author listed in<br />\nthe book (I had never heard of him before) Marmion is one of<br />\nthe front runners in the anti-volunteer army campaign.

When the<br />\nMets began the 1969 season, , the<br />\nmen-in-the-know laughed. And when<br />\nVirginia came to Homewood to play<br />\nJohns Hopkins in lacrosse, the<br />\nCavaliers were supposed to joke<br />\ntheir way to a 25-2 victory.<br />\nInstead the Blue Jays, armed with<br />\na masterful game plan, put forth a<br />\nnear-perfect effort and came within<br />\n2:23 of pulling off the upset of the<br />\nyear. The awesome firepower of the<br />\nVirginia attack, however, ultimately<br />\nproved to be the difference as the<br />\nCavaliers tallied twice in the second<br />\novertime period to eke out a 9-8<br />\nsqueaker in Saturday's lacrosse<br />\ncontest.<br />\nThe outcome marked a heartbreaking loss for a team that had<br />\ntwice rallied back from two goal<br />\ndeficits to lead a superb Virginia<br />\noutfit that was supposed to run them<br />\noff the field.

Eric<br />\nBergofsky tied up the score at seven<br />\napiece by ramming in a bazooka<br />\nshot at 10:42, Donovan assisting.

Bedlam broke<br />\nloose when Dave Pickall put<br />\nHopkins on top with twenty-nine<br />\nseconds remaining.<br />\nIn the second overtime period, the<br />\nBlue Jays failed to do what everyone<br />\nknew was paramount, namely, to<br />\nkeep the ball away from Virginia's<br />\npotent attack. Then came some<br />\ndoubtful calls by the officials that<br />\nleft the Jays one man down for most<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nof the period. The most controversial was a \"spearing\" call on<br />\nDanny Hall. Doug Cooper tied up the<br />\ngame at 1:37 on a pass from allAmerican Tom Duquette, and Pete<br />\nEldredge's at 2:56 trickled through<br />\nDauses' legs into the net. The<br />\nCavaliers took the ensuing faceoff,<br />\nand the nation's number one-ranked<br />\nteam stalled the rest of the way to<br />\ntheir fifth straight win.<br />\nThe Virginia offense started out on<br />\nschedule by jumping on top in the<br />\nfirst ten seconds of play. Throughout<br />\nthe remainder of the first half,<br />\nhowever, it was all Hopkins. Coach<br />\nBob Scott unleased an unorthodox<br />\nstallball attack that saw Jay Hanas<br />\nand Danny Hall merely stand idly<br />\nwith the ball.
