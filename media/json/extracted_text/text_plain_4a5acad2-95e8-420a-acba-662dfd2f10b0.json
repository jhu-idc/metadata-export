With his new<br />\nbook, Electronic Life: How to<br />\nThink About Computers, Crichton attempts to change our attitude toward computers; he<br />\nbelieves most of us are afraid of<br />\nthem. Thus he wants us to understand them before we use<br />\nthem.<br />\nSays Crichton, \"I feel that<br />\nattitudes toward computers are<br />\ninitially more important than<br />\nfacts, this is a book of my<br />\nopinions\u2014or, if you prefer, my<br />\nprejudices.\"<br />\nThe book begins with a few<br />\nstatistics: in 1978, there were<br />\n5000 desk top computers; in<br />\n1982, there were five million;<br />\nand in 1990, there will be 80<br />\nmillion. Crichton is telling us<br />\nthat yes, we are obligated to<br />\nunderstand computers. And<br />\ntells us to \"read on,\" to read<br />\nthe remainder of the book,<br />\nwhich is an alphabetized listing<br />\nof computer terminology.<br />\n\"Afraid of Computers\" is<br />\nthe first section. \"People who<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nfear computers cannot use them<br />\nwisely. Either they reject<br />\nmachines out of hand, and are<br />\ndeprived of the legitimate<br />\nbenefits of computers, or they<br />\naccept the machines but remain<br />\nso intimidated that whatever<br />\nflashes up on a screen is taken<br />\nas received truth. You can get<br />\ninto trouble either way.\"<br />\nNext, Crichton conveniently<br />\nplaces \"Anatomy, Computer\"<br />\nbefore sections such as \"Computer Crime,\" \"Byte,\" and<br />\n\"Languages, Computer\" so<br />\nwe'll know what he's describing<br />\nin the later sections. He<br />\ndiscusses the keyboard, disk<br />\ndrive, monitor, and printer,<br />\ncomparing them to stereo components; the stereo user must<br />\nunderstand each component's<br />\nfunction. Similarly, a computer<br />\nuser must understand computer<br />\ncomponents.<br />\nBut \"it's harder to buy a<br />\ncomputer than to use one,\" so<br />\nCrichton devotes an entire section to computer buying. \"Buy<br />\nfrom a store, not a mail-order<br />\nhouse. . . Buy a flexible machine. . . Don't buy a brandnew machine or program<br />\n...Make the store set it<br />\nup.,.. i3uy a program, not a<br />\nmachine.\"<br />\n<br />\nHe refers to a program as \"a<br />\nset of instructions to make the<br />\ncomputer do something.\" And<br />\nquickly adds that mathematics<br />\nisn't needed to program a<br />\ncomputer.<br />\n\"Computers have little to do<br />\nwith mathematics these days.<br />\nEven the experience of programming in a high-level<br />\nlanguage is not particularly<br />\nmathematical.

That 's what programming is like.\"<br />\nAccording to Crichton, we<br />\nonly have to know how to type<br />\nin order to use a computer<br />\nbecause programs are now<br />\ncapable of programming other<br />\nprograms. We just have to be<br />\npatient while \"Learning,\" be<br />\ncomputer competent, not<br />\nnecessarily \"Literate, Computer,\" and be able to understand humans because computers imitate human beings.<br />\nBut we should never say a<br />\nperson is \"turned on\" or that<br />\na computer \"believes.\"<br />\n\"People are people.

At Stanford, Reitz<br />\ndeveloped the technique for<br />\nheart-lung transplants. Using<br />\nimproved surgical techniques<br />\nand immunosuppression drugs,<br />\nwhich suppress the production<br />\nof antibodies, Reitz performed<br />\nthe first heart-lung transplants<br />\non monkeys. The first human<br />\nheart-lung transplant was performed by Reitz on Ruth Lande<br />\non March 3, 1981. The operation was successful, and Lande<br />\nwent home eighty-five days<br />\nlater.<br />\nDr. Reitz worked in close<br />\nconnection with Dr. William A.<br />\nBaumgartner, an assistant professor of cardiac surgery.<br />\nBaumgartner came from Stanford with Reitz to Hopkins,<br />\nand together they are starting a<br />\nheart and heart-lung transplant<br />\nprogram. Reitz has come to<br />\nHopkins \"for the challenge\"'<br />\nand \"to start a needed program.\"<br />\nReitz was an undergraduate<br />\nat Stanford, a medical student<br />\nat Yale, and an intern at<br />\nHopkins. After spending two<br />\nyears as a clinical associate at<br />\nthe National Heart, Lung and<br />\nBlood institute in Bethesda,<br />\nMaryland, he returned to Stanford to do his residency in cardiovasculer surgery.<br />\nFrom the 1940's through the<br />\n1960's Hopkins was a leader in<br />\nheart transplants. Alfred<br />\nBlalock from Hopkins became<br />\nworld known for his \"blue<br />\nbaby\" operations to correct<br />\ncongenital heart problems. A<br />\nyear after the first heart<br />\ntransplant was performed in<br />\n1967 in South Africa, Dr. Vincent Gott, then chief heart<br />\nsurgeon at Hopkins, performed<br />\nthe same operation on a fiftysix year - old man who died<br />\nseventy-one days later. Few of<br />\nthe early heart recipients sur-<br />\n<br />\nfor suitable organ donations.\"<br />\nPatients applicable for heartlung transplants have extensive<br />\nheart and lung problems. A<br />\nFairly common heart-lung problem is hypertension in the lungs<br />\ncaused by an untreated congential disease in which a hole connects the left ventricle to the<br />\nright ventricle. The patient has<br />\na weak heart and the high blood<br />\npressure causes extensive damage to lung tissue. A heart-lung<br />\ntransplant patient must also<br />\nmeet the following criteria: life<br />\nexpectancy of three to six<br />\nmonths, psychological strength,<br />\nno other life threatening condition, age 18-50, and financial<br />\nstability.<br />\n<br />\nvived their firsi postoperative<br />\nyear. Rejection and infection<br />\nrates were high. In order for<br />\nheart transplants to become<br />\ntherapeutically advantageous,<br />\nmore research was needed to<br />\nimprove the operation protocol. Hopkins was not willing to<br />\nmake this commitment, and<br />\nthus for the past fifteen years<br />\nHopkins has had no heart<br />\ntransplant program.<br />\nDr. Norman Shumway, head<br />\nheart surgeon at Stanford,<br />\nmade the commitment, and<br />\nresearch revealed clyclosporin<br />\nA, a small polypeptide produced by a fungus, to be an effective immunosuppressin. Cyclosporm A inactivates the<br />\nbody's T-Iymphocyles, a type<br />\nof white blood cell. Inactivated<br />\nT-Iymphocyles decrease the activity of B-Iymphocyles, white<br />\nblood cells producing antibodies to foreign substances (i.e.<br />\ntransplant organs).

What, indeed?<br />\nWhen six well-dressed<br />\n\"restaurateurs\" stroll into a<br />\nrustic bar in the Middle of<br />\nNowhere, PA,they are charmingly incongruous in their roughhewn surroundings. The men<br />\nare on their way to a fellow<br />\nrestaurateur's burial, but what<br />\nwas meant to be a stopover<br />\nbecomes the journey's end as<br />\nFritz, the already-sloshed<br />\nundertaker, passes out, locking<br />\nthe party's final burial destination inside his sodden brain. As<br />\nthe afternoon 'progresses, so do<br />\nnew and very innovative burial<br />\nplans. But in Zettler's play,<br />\nfunerals are not for veneration;<br />\nthe man they are burying is the<br />\nman \"everyone loved to hate.\"<br />\nHis only virtue is that he has<br />\nbrought those men together.<br />\nAs the play unfolds, so do<br />\nthe various personalities, but<br />\nthe play suffers from an uneven<br />\nscript. and so do the characters.<br />\nThe restaurateurs are living<br />\ntestimony to the great American melting pot; they are, as<br />\none character puts it, \"spics<br />\nand dagos and heinies and<br />\nthese<br />\nBecause<br />\nmicks.\"<br />\nstereotypes are emphasized in<br />\nthe script, they tend to be incorporated into the roles.<br />\nHowever, a unique pride in<br />\ntheir restaurants is both their<br />\ncompassion and competition; it<br />\nis their common element. It has<br />\nbeen for a while, it seems, as<br />\nwhen they enter they are engaged in the archetypal comedic<br />\nping- pong of old friends.

Contrasted with<br />\nthe elaborate, exquisitely<br />\nnaturalistic set (to the extent that<br />\nwhen the phone booth closes,<br />\nthe light inside goes on)actors'<br />\nexaggeration is more evident.<br />\nAct II, although it remains<br />\nuneven, works far better<br />\ndramatically. Someone says,<br />\n\"In this room you can't keep<br />\nanything under wraps \u2014 not<br />\n<br />\nmost of the interactions; thus<br />\ntheir arguments are detrimental<br />\nas they are unbelievable. The<br />\nworst of this is an insult which<br />\nthreatens to turn into an actual<br />\nfistfight. Rudi(the charismatic<br />\nleader of the group) picks the<br />\nfight with Kelly (the Irish teller<br />\nof tales) calling him an atheist,<br />\nand then runs away from it.<br />\nThey dance around amid the<br />\nbarstools, Kelly puffing and<br />\nthrowing things, until, finally,<br />\nsilver-tongued Rudi talks him<br />\ndrawn from his \"mad\".

Burying him in the<br />\nwoods would have been much<br />\ncheaper (less symbolic, but<br />\nmuch cheaper!) In addition,<br />\nthe dialogue used to persuade<br />\nJim is unconvincing. Rudi says<br />\nreassuringly to Jim,\"We're all<br />\ncrazy.\" (indicates the wise,<br />\nbearded Gonzales)\"ask him if<br />\nhe's crazy.\" Jim (aside in a<br />\nstage whisper) \"I can't do<br />\nthat!\" The line is as silly as Jim<br />\nseems when he says it.<br />\nSix (actually nine) characters<br />\ncreate a lot of substance, and<br />\nalthough Zettler on the whole<br />\nmarshals his characters well, in<br />\nthe end they threaten to get out<br />\nof hand. Because it is only in<br />\nthe third act that we discover<br />\nthe \"reality\" behind conflict<br />\nafter conflict, the play becomes<br />\nexhausting. Struggles for independence, restaurant \"scooping\", familial substitutions and<br />\nextractions, a son as a new symbol of hope, fear of statutory<br />\nrape and of ghosts, explode and<br />\nresolve. To the panting audience, the play seems to climax<br />\nthree or four times.<br />\nGonzales, the wise old<br />\nspaniard (beautifully portrayed<br />\nby Irwin Ziff) moralizes, \"the<br />\ntrick is to give just a little more<br />\nthan they pay for \u2014 it is a<br />\ndelicate balance.\" Crossing the<br />\nBar requires a delicate balance<br />\nboth within the script and<br />\nwithin the performance. The<br />\nbiggest flaw is that both script<br />\nand production often list to one<br />\nside. For example, Jay Devlin's<br />\nportrayal of the saloon keeper,<br />\nJim Mulhern, maintains in the<br />\nfirst act the delicate balance<br />\nbetween the laconic and the<br />\nstupid, and he gives a superbly<br />\nnatural, gently humorous performance. However, by the second<br />\nand third acts, the script<br />\nsimplifies Jim's character and<br />\nthus Devlin plays it more<br />\nbroadly, more stupidly. This is<br />\nunfortunate, as Devlin's craft<br />\nin the first act is exceptional.<br />\nFortunately as the play<br />\nevolves, the other characters<br />\nbecome more complex, so that<br />\nthe acting in the third act is<br />\nsignificantly better than it was<br />\n<br />\nin the first act. Stan Lachow's<br />\nAugie is the most consistent<br />\nand, as the underdog, the most<br />\nconsistently loveable character<br />\nin the play. Lachow is<br />\nmarvelous as the agitated little<br />\nman who finally succeeds in<br />\nachieving a second adulthood<br />\nas he stands up to his overprotective best friend.<br />\nRudi, who is the charismatic<br />\nfast talking leader of the group,<br />\nis ably played by William<br />\nMooney. Mooney has moments<br />\nof brillance, as when he tells a<br />\nfriend, \"in four years, I know<br />\nwhat you say and what you<br />\nmean!\" But his character, too,<br />\noccasionally lacks the spark<br />\nnecessary to remain the moving<br />\nforce of the play; his<br />\n.monologues are overlong and<br />\nsometimes maudlin.<br />\nHowever, in general, the cast<br />\ngives satisfactory performances; their skill seems directly proportionate to the amount<br />\nof help the script is able to give<br />\nthem. When then play is \"on\",<br />\nthe actors are \"on\" and the<br />\nperformance is excellent; when<br />\nthe tenuous balance is upset by<br />\ng script fluctuation, the performance suffers.<br />\nCrossing the Bar is billed as<br />\n\"a wickedly funny ode to mariners and morals in the heat of<br />\nthe American melting pot.\"<br />\nThis, despite previous criticisms<br />\nis true. When the drunken Fitz<br />\nfinally awakens at the end of<br />\nthe play and asks \"What happened?\" Rudi<br />\nanswers<br />\n\"Nothing much \u2014 good meal,<br />\ncoupl'a fights \u2014 nothing<br />\nmuch.\" But on the contrary,<br />\neverything happens in Crossing<br />\nthe Bar. Zettler tries to do too<br />\nmuch in two hours, and the<br />\nresult is somewhat confusing.<br />\nBut the potential is there: the<br />\nset is near perfect, and the<br />\nhumor already exists in full<br />\nmeasure, as does a shrewd<br />\ngrasp of human character. All<br />\nthat is necessary is a judicious<br />\nediting and a sense of how<br />\nmany times an audience can<br />\ncross the bar before they never<br />\ncome back.For further info,<br />\nsee Arts Calendar<br />\n<br />\nUnder Fire Should Be Kept Under Wraps<br />\nby Stuart Lichten<br />\nWhen a film attempts to<br />\ncreate fiction against the<br />\nbackground of real-life events<br />\nit raises two questions.

The earlier the<br />\nbetter!<br />\nby Susan Kaplan<br />\n\u2022 Each year many Hopkins<br />\nstudents decide to study<br />\nabroad. Whether for one semester or one year, living and<br />\nlearning in a new environment<br />\nis an enriching experience.<br />\nArlene Wergin, head of the<br />\nStudy Abroad department of<br />\nAdvising and Counseling, reported that 27 students had<br />\nopted to attend foreign universities last year. Some were<br />\nEconomics majors, some were<br />\nInternational Relations and<br />\nothers were History, and a few<br />\nwere science students, new to<br />\nthis type of program. Even premeds are now finding that it is<br />\npossible to fulfill degree requirements abroad. They studied in Italy and in England,<br />\nFrance and Spain\u2014there were<br />\neven students in Israel and<br />\nChina. And virtually every student reported having had a<br />\npositive experience, even those<br />\nwho were initially ambivalent.<br />\nAnd many didn't want to return home, especially those<br />\nwho had been away only one<br />\nsemester.<br />\nThe study abroad office<br />\nhelps students to decide where<br />\nto go\u2014for each major the requirements differ, and for every<br />\nindividual a program must be<br />\ntailored to his needs and expectations. Courses, credits, and<br />\n<br />\nbe taken pass/fail, as a student<br />\nmust receive a C or better in a<br />\ncourse to get credit. Students<br />\nmust keep in mind that while<br />\none cannot lower one's grade<br />\npoint average by taking classes<br />\nelsewhere, neither can one raise<br />\nit. So if your grades aren't<br />\ngreat, and you need to bring up<br />\nyour average, you might consider staying at Hopkins to do<br />\nso. Graduate schools will need<br />\nthe transcript from the institution overseas at which the courses were taken, or from the<br />\nAmerican university under<br />\nwhose auspices the courses were<br />\noffered. Often students request<br />\ncopies of their transcripts if<br />\nthey performed exceptionally<br />\nwell.<br />\nCourses and credits are<br />\ngenerally commensurate with<br />\nthose offered by Johns Hopkins; for specific accrediting,<br />\nprofessors are often consulted<br />\nin evaluating the worth of a<br />\nforeign school's courses in relation to those at Hopkins. Specific degree requirements may be<br />\nfulfilled if courses are approved<br />\nfar enough in advance through<br />\nrelevant departments and a student's faculty advisor.<br />\n\"Traditionally,\" explains<br />\nWergin, \"study abroad was<br />\nrestricted to those in the social<br />\nsciences. Now we can recommend outstanding universities<br />\nwhich offer programs for premeds. But he must get specific<br />\ncourses approved.\" Ideally,<br />\nsuch programs enhance a student's curriculum, and do not<br />\nhinder him from receiving his<br />\ndegree on time. Many institutions now have suitable premed programs which offer<br />\ncomparable courses to those in<br />\nthe U.S., so that a pre-med<br />\nneed not take only electives, but<br />\nrequirements as well.<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nment with courses in govern- of that one must research on<br />\nment and politics.

According io<br />\none student who spent a year in<br />\nGermany,\"'Intellectual challenge' is not a good description<br />\nof what you have while abroad.\" However, students<br />\nalso agreed that this was not<br />\nnecessarily a problem for them,<br />\nas it gave them more time to explore and travel, and they<br />\nmaintained that if they had<br />\nwanted to be burdened with<br />\nwork, they would have stayed<br />\nat, Hopkins. Several students<br />\nfelt that the workload was comparable, but emphasized depth<br />\nrather than quantity. They<br />\nfound professors to be knowledgeable and friendly and they<br />\nenjoyed the academic freedom<br />\noffered.<br />\nEveryone agreed that the<br />\nmost important aspect of their<br />\ntime abroad was their opportunity to experience a new<br />\nculture. Advice offered almost<br />\nunanimously: mingle, try new<br />\nthings, use the facilities of the<br />\ninstitution to their fullest. In<br />\nshort, experiment. As one student put it, \"Use this time as<br />\nyour year to do things that are<br />\ndifferent.\"<br />\nTuition for study abroad<br />\nprograms is highly variable, as<br />\nit is paid to the university whose<br />\nprogram one utilizes, or directly<br />\nto the foreign university. It<br />\nshould be noted that students<br />\nleaving as of September, 1984<br />\nmust pay 10% of Hopkins' tuition in addition. The student<br />\nstudying abroad has the status<br />\nof a JHU student on leave.<br />\nStudying abroad, asserts<br />\nWergin, is seen as positive by<br />\nboth Medical and Law schools,<br />\nas well as other graduate institutions. \"It implies a student's ability to plan and to adjust to new environments, and<br />\nis recognized as a worthwhile<br />\nexperience.\" If you are interested in exploring the possibility of studying abroad, you<br />\nwill find friendly assistance at<br />\nthe Office of Advising and<br />\nCounseling. There is a file of<br />\nU.S. and foreign institutions<br />\nthat offer excellent programs.<br />\nIn addition, Wergin holds<br />\na file of questionaires filled out<br />\nby students returning from<br />\noverseas. Answers to questions<br />\nlike \"What were your living arrangements?\" and \"How<br />\nwould you rate the quality of<br />\ninstruction?\" may help you get<br />\na better idea of what to expect<br />\nat a specific institution.<br />\nNow people in virtually all<br />\nmajors can consider taking time<br />\noff from Hopkins, time to<br />\nstudy in a new environment and<br />\nto meet new people. And one<br />\nneed,not fear that this time off<br />\nrepresents a hindrance to one's<br />\nplanned course of study, as<br />\nspecific requirements may be<br />\nfulfilled elsewhere. Says Bill of<br />\nhis year abroad, \"I consider it<br />\nnot only an enjoyable experience, but an asset to my education.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/15<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nZimmerman Named New Jay Lacrosse Coach<br />\ncont. from p.

The longest<br />\nseason in sports is over, and<br />\nhere are some of the best and<br />\nworst highlights of the year:<br />\nFirst off, congratulations are<br />\ndue to the four division winners: Baltimore, Chicago,<br />\nPhiladelphia, and Los Angeles.<br />\nEach won its division by a<br />\nsizeable margin, but, except for<br />\nChicago, each was tested during August and September and<br />\neach earned the right to play in<br />\nthe playoffs.<br />\nOn the last day of the season,<br />\nthree managers were dismissed<br />\nas a result of their team's performance. The ousting of Harvey Kuenn comes as no surprise<br />\nto any Brewer fan, as general<br />\nmanager Harry Dalton has<br />\nbeen talking about a possible<br />\nmanagerial change for weeks.<br />\nThough former Mariner<br />\nmanager Rene Lachemann<br />\nseems to be the better man for<br />\nthe job, the firing is still an insult to Kuenn, who took a lackluster 1982 Brewer team and<br />\nbrought it its first American<br />\nLeague championship. The<br />\nBrewers this year were without<br />\nthe use of star pitchers Pete<br />\nVuckovich and Rollie Fingers,<br />\nso Kuenn can hardly be blamed<br />\nfor the demise of his pitching<br />\nstaff.<br />\nCharlie Fox resigned as<br />\nmanager of the Cubs to return<br />\nto the front office. He replaced<br />\nLee Ella in mid-season.<br />\nMets general manager Frank<br />\nCashen made another mistake<br />\nin firing manager Frank<br />\nHoward before the Mets' final<br />\ngame. Aside from Earl Weaver,<br />\nthe Mets could not find a better manager than Howard, who<br />\nsucceeded in bringing respectability to a Mets team which<br />\nwas the joke of the league in<br />\n<br />\nMay. He will be sorely missed.<br />\nWhile on the subject of<br />\nmanagers, one cannot ignore<br />\nthe New York Yankees. Look<br />\nfor Billy Martin to step down<br />\nvoluntarily from the post of<br />\nYankees manager during the<br />\noff-season. Billy has already indicated his displeasure with the<br />\npresent player situation in New<br />\nYork, and is sick of their attitudes and on-field performance.<br />\nOn the brighter side, one can<br />\nexpect Tony LaRussa to be<br />\nnamed as A. L. Manager of the<br />\nYear and Paul Owens to be<br />\nnamed as N. L. Manager of the<br />\nYear. LaRussa has conditioned<br />\nthe White Sox' pitching staff to<br />\na new standard of excellence,<br />\nand Owens blew away the N.

L.<br />\nRookie-of-the-Year award on<br />\nopening day (.252, 96 RBI's, 34<br />\nHR's).<br />\nThe loss of Bob Horner<br />\nproved fatal to the Atlanta<br />\nBraves' pennant hopes this<br />\nyear. One can only imagine<br />\nwhat Atlanta would have done<br />\nwithout Dale Murphy (.305,<br />\n121 RBI's, 36 HR's, 30 SB), the<br />\nprobable N. L. MVP. Steve<br />\nRogers is destined for the<br />\nN. L.

Senior Geraldine Klauber and junior Ken i Fischer<br />\nproved you wrong last May<br />\nwhen they were invited to the<br />\nNCAA Division 3 Women's<br />\nNational Tennis Championships. Their 12 and I doubles<br />\nrecord, and Klauber's 11 and 2<br />\nsingles record earned them their<br />\nplaces in the draw in sunny<br />\nClaremont, California. Klauber<br />\nwas a veteran of these championships, having played in<br />\nJackson, Mississippi in 1982.<br />\nThat year she played both first<br />\nsingles and doubles with then<br />\nsenior Amy Buchanan.<br />\nThe past May, Klauber and<br />\nFischer lost a heartbreaker in<br />\nthree sets to a pair from U. Cal.<br />\nSan Diego in the first round.<br />\nKlauber remembers it being<br />\n\"really a tight match. It could<br />\nhave easily gone to us in the<br />\nfinal set of the tiebreaker.\" The<br />\nteam they lost to reached the<br />\nquarter finals of the tournament.<br />\nKlauber fared a little better<br />\n<br />\nplaying first singles. -She won<br />\nthe first round handily (6-3,<br />\n6-3). The second round, played<br />\nthe same day, stopped her cold<br />\n(6-2, 6-1). Not one to make excuses, Klauber didn't complain<br />\nabout the tough scheduling.<br />\nFischer explains, \"She had<br />\nplayed a great match earlier in<br />\nthe day without knowing about<br />\nthe second round. If Geraldine<br />\nhad been in top form she could<br />\nhave done really well.\"<br />\nUnfortunately, the Women's<br />\n<br />\nNational Championships are<br />\nheld in the spring. Hopkins<br />\nwomen play their regular season in the fall and play only a<br />\nfew tournaments and scrimmages in the spring. This is due<br />\nto the problem of sharing<br />\ncourts with the men (who have<br />\ntheir regular season in the<br />\nspring) and a lack of money.<br />\nCoach Kay Fowler-Dressler<br />\nhopes the school will recognize<br />\ntheir problem and help them<br />\nfind a solution. Klauber and<br />\n<br />\nFischer hope \"next year we can<br />\nbe more prepared and matchtough. We certainly won't be<br />\nintimidated. The experience last<br />\nMay was invaluable.\"'<br />\nObviously, a free trip to<br />\nCalifornia, and great tennis<br />\nbesides, was a terrific opportunity. Klauber feels the nationals are \"definitely a<br />\nhighlight of my college career.\"<br />\nShe enjoyed the caliber of play,<br />\nalthough, surprisingly, it isn't<br />\nas competitive as the upcoming<br />\n<br />\n1111114111<br />\n<br />\nTennis Life Tournament (this<br />\nweekend).<br />\n\"I'm glad I went to the nationals and I'm sure we'll do<br />\neven better next year,\" Fischer<br />\nsaid. \"Hopkins is now a legitimate tennis power.

Most recently, he directed the film version of his own novel The Great<br />\nTrain Robbery.<br />\nCrichton has always been<br />\nfascinated by technology, but<br />\nmost important, by its possible<br />\neffects upon us. With his new<br />\nbook, Electronic Life: How to<br />\nThink About Computers, Crichton attempts to change our attitude toward computers; he<br />\nbelieves most of us are afraid of<br />\nthem. Thus he wants us to understand them before we use<br />\nthem.<br />\nSays Crichton, \"I feel that<br />\nattitudes toward computers are<br />\ninitially more important than<br />\nfacts, this is a book of my<br />\nopinions\u2014or, if you prefer, my<br />\nprejudices.\"<br />\nThe book begins with a few<br />\nstatistics: in 1978, there were<br />\n5000 desk top computers; in<br />\n1982, there were five million;<br />\nand in 1990, there will be 80<br />\nmillion. Crichton is telling us<br />\nthat yes, we are obligated to<br />\nunderstand computers. And<br />\ntells us to \"read on,\" to read<br />\nthe remainder of the book,<br />\nwhich is an alphabetized listing<br />\nof computer terminology.<br />\n\"Afraid of Computers\" is<br />\nthe first section. \"People who<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nfear computers cannot use them<br />\nwisely. Either they reject<br />\nmachines out of hand, and are<br />\ndeprived of the legitimate<br />\nbenefits of computers, or they<br />\naccept the machines but remain<br />\nso intimidated that whatever<br />\nflashes up on a screen is taken<br />\nas received truth. You can get<br />\ninto trouble either way.\"<br />\nNext, Crichton conveniently<br />\nplaces \"Anatomy, Computer\"<br />\nbefore sections such as \"Computer Crime,\" \"Byte,\" and<br />\n\"Languages, Computer\" so<br />\nwe'll know what he's describing<br />\nin the later sections. He<br />\ndiscusses the keyboard, disk<br />\ndrive, monitor, and printer,<br />\ncomparing them to stereo components; the stereo user must<br />\nunderstand each component's<br />\nfunction. Similarly, a computer<br />\nuser must understand computer<br />\ncomponents.<br />\nBut \"it's harder to buy a<br />\ncomputer than to use one,\" so<br />\nCrichton devotes an entire section to computer buying. \"Buy<br />\nfrom a store, not a mail-order<br />\nhouse. . . Buy a flexible machine. . . Don't buy a brandnew machine or program<br />\n...Make the store set it<br />\nup.,.. i3uy a program, not a<br />\nmachine.\"<br /><br />\nHe refers to a program as \"a<br />\nset of instructions to make the<br />\ncomputer do something.\" And<br />\nquickly adds that mathematics<br />\nisn't needed to program a<br />\ncomputer.<br />\n\"Computers have little to do<br />\nwith mathematics these days.<br />\nEven the experience of programming in a high-level<br />\nlanguage is not particularly<br />\nmathematical.

That 's what programming is like.\"<br />\nAccording to Crichton, we<br />\nonly have to know how to type<br />\nin order to use a computer<br />\nbecause programs are now<br />\ncapable of programming other<br />\nprograms. We just have to be<br />\npatient while \"Learning,\" be<br />\ncomputer competent, not<br />\nnecessarily \"Literate, Computer,\" and be able to understand humans because computers imitate human beings.<br />\nBut we should never say a<br />\nperson is \"turned on\" or that<br />\na computer \"believes.\"<br />\n\"People are people.

At Stanford, Reitz<br />\ndeveloped the technique for<br />\nheart-lung transplants. Using<br />\nimproved surgical techniques<br />\nand immunosuppression drugs,<br />\nwhich suppress the production<br />\nof antibodies, Reitz performed<br />\nthe first heart-lung transplants<br />\non monkeys. The first human<br />\nheart-lung transplant was performed by Reitz on Ruth Lande<br />\non March 3, 1981. The operation was successful, and Lande<br />\nwent home eighty-five days<br />\nlater.<br />\nDr. Reitz worked in close<br />\nconnection with Dr. William A.<br />\nBaumgartner, an assistant professor of cardiac surgery.<br />\nBaumgartner came from Stanford with Reitz to Hopkins,<br />\nand together they are starting a<br />\nheart and heart-lung transplant<br />\nprogram. Reitz has come to<br />\nHopkins \"for the challenge\"'<br />\nand \"to start a needed program.\"<br />\nReitz was an undergraduate<br />\nat Stanford, a medical student<br />\nat Yale, and an intern at<br />\nHopkins. After spending two<br />\nyears as a clinical associate at<br />\nthe National Heart, Lung and<br />\nBlood institute in Bethesda,<br />\nMaryland, he returned to Stanford to do his residency in cardiovasculer surgery.<br />\nFrom the 1940's through the<br />\n1960's Hopkins was a leader in<br />\nheart transplants. Alfred<br />\nBlalock from Hopkins became<br />\nworld known for his \"blue<br />\nbaby\" operations to correct<br />\ncongenital heart problems. A<br />\nyear after the first heart<br />\ntransplant was performed in<br />\n1967 in South Africa, Dr. Vincent Gott, then chief heart<br />\nsurgeon at Hopkins, performed<br />\nthe same operation on a fiftysix year - old man who died<br />\nseventy-one days later. Few of<br />\nthe early heart recipients sur-<br /><br />\nfor suitable organ donations.\"<br />\nPatients applicable for heartlung transplants have extensive<br />\nheart and lung problems. A<br />\nFairly common heart-lung problem is hypertension in the lungs<br />\ncaused by an untreated congential disease in which a hole connects the left ventricle to the<br />\nright ventricle. The patient has<br />\na weak heart and the high blood<br />\npressure causes extensive damage to lung tissue. A heart-lung<br />\ntransplant patient must also<br />\nmeet the following criteria: life<br />\nexpectancy of three to six<br />\nmonths, psychological strength,<br />\nno other life threatening condition, age 18-50, and financial<br />\nstability.<br /><br />\nvived their firsi postoperative<br />\nyear. Rejection and infection<br />\nrates were high. In order for<br />\nheart transplants to become<br />\ntherapeutically advantageous,<br />\nmore research was needed to<br />\nimprove the operation protocol. Hopkins was not willing to<br />\nmake this commitment, and<br />\nthus for the past fifteen years<br />\nHopkins has had no heart<br />\ntransplant program.<br />\nDr. Norman Shumway, head<br />\nheart surgeon at Stanford,<br />\nmade the commitment, and<br />\nresearch revealed clyclosporin<br />\nA, a small polypeptide produced by a fungus, to be an effective immunosuppressin. Cyclosporm A inactivates the<br />\nbody's T-Iymphocyles, a type<br />\nof white blood cell. Inactivated<br />\nT-Iymphocyles decrease the activity of B-Iymphocyles, white<br />\nblood cells producing antibodies to foreign substances (i.e.<br />\ntransplant organs).

Before<br />\ncyclosporin A was recognized<br />\nas an important immunosuppressin, Prednisone was used.<br />\nPrednisone prevents transplant<br />\nrejection but wipes out the patient's immune system thus<br />\nleaving the patient very susceptible to infection. Improved<br />\nsurgical techniques and ex-,<br />\nperiments on dogs and monkeys also aided in improving<br />\nthe heart transplant protocol.<br />\nIn 1977, approximately seventy percent of Shaumway's patients were surviving one year<br />\nafter the transplant and fifty<br />\npercent were surviving three<br />\nyears after the transplant. One<br />\npatient was doing well in his<br />\neleventh postoperative year.<br />\nSince the first heart transplant operation was performed<br />\nby Christiaan Barnard in 1967,<br />\nover 877 have been performed<br />\nin the world, and more than 270<br />\nwere performed at Stanford.<br />\nApproximately seventy-five<br />\nwere performed in the U.S. in<br />\n1981. One hundred eighty were<br />\nperformed in 1982, and Reitz<br />\npredicts that over two hundred<br />\nwill be performed in 1983.<br />\nThere are five other surgeons<br />\non Reitz's cardiovascular<br />\nsurgery staff at Hopkins. Reitz<br />\nhas spent a year setting up<br />\nnecessary equipment and training nurses and surgeons. Three<br />\nof the surgeons, including Reitz<br />\nand Baumgartner, will be principally involved in the twelve to<br />\ntwenty heart and heart-lung<br />\ntransplants expected per year.<br />\nAll six surgeons will perform<br />\nover two hundred open heart<br />\nsurgeries on patients requiring<br />\ninsertion of pace makers, cor-<br /><br />\nonary bypasses, valve replacements, or correction of congenital heart defects.

The surgeon has<br />\ntwo hours to make the four<br />\nnecessary connections and<br />\nwarm the heart-lung. (The<br />\ncooled heart-lung has enough<br />\noxygen to persist for only two<br />\nhours.)

What, indeed?<br />\nWhen six well-dressed<br />\n\"restaurateurs\" stroll into a<br />\nrustic bar in the Middle of<br />\nNowhere, PA,they are charmingly incongruous in their roughhewn surroundings. The men<br />\nare on their way to a fellow<br />\nrestaurateur's burial, but what<br />\nwas meant to be a stopover<br />\nbecomes the journey's end as<br />\nFritz, the already-sloshed<br />\nundertaker, passes out, locking<br />\nthe party's final burial destination inside his sodden brain. As<br />\nthe afternoon 'progresses, so do<br />\nnew and very innovative burial<br />\nplans. But in Zettler's play,<br />\nfunerals are not for veneration;<br />\nthe man they are burying is the<br />\nman \"everyone loved to hate.\"<br />\nHis only virtue is that he has<br />\nbrought those men together.<br />\nAs the play unfolds, so do<br />\nthe various personalities, but<br />\nthe play suffers from an uneven<br />\nscript. and so do the characters.<br />\nThe restaurateurs are living<br />\ntestimony to the great American melting pot; they are, as<br />\none character puts it, \"spics<br />\nand dagos and heinies and<br />\nthese<br />\nBecause<br />\nmicks.\"<br />\nstereotypes are emphasized in<br />\nthe script, they tend to be incorporated into the roles.<br />\nHowever, a unique pride in<br />\ntheir restaurants is both their<br />\ncompassion and competition; it<br />\nis their common element. It has<br />\nbeen for a while, it seems, as<br />\nwhen they enter they are engaged in the archetypal comedic<br />\nping- pong of old friends.

Contrasted with<br />\nthe elaborate, exquisitely<br />\nnaturalistic set (to the extent that<br />\nwhen the phone booth closes,<br />\nthe light inside goes on)actors'<br />\nexaggeration is more evident.<br />\nAct II, although it remains<br />\nuneven, works far better<br />\ndramatically. Someone says,<br />\n\"In this room you can't keep<br />\nanything under wraps \u2014 not<br /><br />\nmost of the interactions; thus<br />\ntheir arguments are detrimental<br />\nas they are unbelievable. The<br />\nworst of this is an insult which<br />\nthreatens to turn into an actual<br />\nfistfight. Rudi(the charismatic<br />\nleader of the group) picks the<br />\nfight with Kelly (the Irish teller<br />\nof tales) calling him an atheist,<br />\nand then runs away from it.<br />\nThey dance around amid the<br />\nbarstools, Kelly puffing and<br />\nthrowing things, until, finally,<br />\nsilver-tongued Rudi talks him<br />\ndrawn from his \"mad\".

In an effort to \"cemuch of what they say seems ment\" the burial with Jim, the<br />\ncontrived in the playwright's ef- laconic saloon keeper, the<br />\nfort to create dramatic tension. burial runs the restaurateurs inThis is because, intrinsically, to thousands of dollars worth<br />\nthere is not enough at stake in of \"bribes\" of cash and used<br /><br />\nfurniture. Burying him in the<br />\nwoods would have been much<br />\ncheaper (less symbolic, but<br />\nmuch cheaper!) In addition,<br />\nthe dialogue used to persuade<br />\nJim is unconvincing. Rudi says<br />\nreassuringly to Jim,\"We're all<br />\ncrazy.\" (indicates the wise,<br />\nbearded Gonzales)\"ask him if<br />\nhe's crazy.\" Jim (aside in a<br />\nstage whisper) \"I can't do<br />\nthat!\" The line is as silly as Jim<br />\nseems when he says it.<br />\nSix (actually nine) characters<br />\ncreate a lot of substance, and<br />\nalthough Zettler on the whole<br />\nmarshals his characters well, in<br />\nthe end they threaten to get out<br />\nof hand. Because it is only in<br />\nthe third act that we discover<br />\nthe \"reality\" behind conflict<br />\nafter conflict, the play becomes<br />\nexhausting. Struggles for independence, restaurant \"scooping\", familial substitutions and<br />\nextractions, a son as a new symbol of hope, fear of statutory<br />\nrape and of ghosts, explode and<br />\nresolve. To the panting audience, the play seems to climax<br />\nthree or four times.<br />\nGonzales, the wise old<br />\nspaniard (beautifully portrayed<br />\nby Irwin Ziff) moralizes, \"the<br />\ntrick is to give just a little more<br />\nthan they pay for \u2014 it is a<br />\ndelicate balance.\" Crossing the<br />\nBar requires a delicate balance<br />\nboth within the script and<br />\nwithin the performance. The<br />\nbiggest flaw is that both script<br />\nand production often list to one<br />\nside. For example, Jay Devlin's<br />\nportrayal of the saloon keeper,<br />\nJim Mulhern, maintains in the<br />\nfirst act the delicate balance<br />\nbetween the laconic and the<br />\nstupid, and he gives a superbly<br />\nnatural, gently humorous performance. However, by the second<br />\nand third acts, the script<br />\nsimplifies Jim's character and<br />\nthus Devlin plays it more<br />\nbroadly, more stupidly. This is<br />\nunfortunate, as Devlin's craft<br />\nin the first act is exceptional.<br />\nFortunately as the play<br />\nevolves, the other characters<br />\nbecome more complex, so that<br />\nthe acting in the third act is<br />\nsignificantly better than it was<br /><br />\nin the first act. Stan Lachow's<br />\nAugie is the most consistent<br />\nand, as the underdog, the most<br />\nconsistently loveable character<br />\nin the play. Lachow is<br />\nmarvelous as the agitated little<br />\nman who finally succeeds in<br />\nachieving a second adulthood<br />\nas he stands up to his overprotective best friend.<br />\nRudi, who is the charismatic<br />\nfast talking leader of the group,<br />\nis ably played by William<br />\nMooney. Mooney has moments<br />\nof brillance, as when he tells a<br />\nfriend, \"in four years, I know<br />\nwhat you say and what you<br />\nmean!\" But his character, too,<br />\noccasionally lacks the spark<br />\nnecessary to remain the moving<br />\nforce of the play; his<br />\n.monologues are overlong and<br />\nsometimes maudlin.<br />\nHowever, in general, the cast<br />\ngives satisfactory performances; their skill seems directly proportionate to the amount<br />\nof help the script is able to give<br />\nthem. When then play is \"on\",<br />\nthe actors are \"on\" and the<br />\nperformance is excellent; when<br />\nthe tenuous balance is upset by<br />\ng script fluctuation, the performance suffers.<br />\nCrossing the Bar is billed as<br />\n\"a wickedly funny ode to mariners and morals in the heat of<br />\nthe American melting pot.\"<br />\nThis, despite previous criticisms<br />\nis true. When the drunken Fitz<br />\nfinally awakens at the end of<br />\nthe play and asks \"What happened?\" Rudi<br />\nanswers<br />\n\"Nothing much \u2014 good meal,<br />\ncoupl'a fights \u2014 nothing<br />\nmuch.\" But on the contrary,<br />\neverything happens in Crossing<br />\nthe Bar. Zettler tries to do too<br />\nmuch in two hours, and the<br />\nresult is somewhat confusing.<br />\nBut the potential is there: the<br />\nset is near perfect, and the<br />\nhumor already exists in full<br />\nmeasure, as does a shrewd<br />\ngrasp of human character. All<br />\nthat is necessary is a judicious<br />\nediting and a sense of how<br />\nmany times an audience can<br />\ncross the bar before they never<br />\ncome back.For further info,<br />\nsee Arts Calendar<br /><br />\nUnder Fire Should Be Kept Under Wraps<br />\nby Stuart Lichten<br />\nWhen a film attempts to<br />\ncreate fiction against the<br />\nbackground of real-life events<br />\nit raises two questions.

The earlier the<br />\nbetter!<br />\nby Susan Kaplan<br />\n\u2022 Each year many Hopkins<br />\nstudents decide to study<br />\nabroad. Whether for one semester or one year, living and<br />\nlearning in a new environment<br />\nis an enriching experience.<br />\nArlene Wergin, head of the<br />\nStudy Abroad department of<br />\nAdvising and Counseling, reported that 27 students had<br />\nopted to attend foreign universities last year. Some were<br />\nEconomics majors, some were<br />\nInternational Relations and<br />\nothers were History, and a few<br />\nwere science students, new to<br />\nthis type of program. Even premeds are now finding that it is<br />\npossible to fulfill degree requirements abroad. They studied in Italy and in England,<br />\nFrance and Spain\u2014there were<br />\neven students in Israel and<br />\nChina. And virtually every student reported having had a<br />\npositive experience, even those<br />\nwho were initially ambivalent.<br />\nAnd many didn't want to return home, especially those<br />\nwho had been away only one<br />\nsemester.<br />\nThe study abroad office<br />\nhelps students to decide where<br />\nto go\u2014for each major the requirements differ, and for every<br />\nindividual a program must be<br />\ntailored to his needs and expectations. Courses, credits, and<br /><br />\nbe taken pass/fail, as a student<br />\nmust receive a C or better in a<br />\ncourse to get credit. Students<br />\nmust keep in mind that while<br />\none cannot lower one's grade<br />\npoint average by taking classes<br />\nelsewhere, neither can one raise<br />\nit. So if your grades aren't<br />\ngreat, and you need to bring up<br />\nyour average, you might consider staying at Hopkins to do<br />\nso. Graduate schools will need<br />\nthe transcript from the institution overseas at which the courses were taken, or from the<br />\nAmerican university under<br />\nwhose auspices the courses were<br />\noffered. Often students request<br />\ncopies of their transcripts if<br />\nthey performed exceptionally<br />\nwell.<br />\nCourses and credits are<br />\ngenerally commensurate with<br />\nthose offered by Johns Hopkins; for specific accrediting,<br />\nprofessors are often consulted<br />\nin evaluating the worth of a<br />\nforeign school's courses in relation to those at Hopkins. Specific degree requirements may be<br />\nfulfilled if courses are approved<br />\nfar enough in advance through<br />\nrelevant departments and a student's faculty advisor.<br />\n\"Traditionally,\" explains<br />\nWergin, \"study abroad was<br />\nrestricted to those in the social<br />\nsciences. Now we can recommend outstanding universities<br />\nwhich offer programs for premeds. But he must get specific<br />\ncourses approved.\" Ideally,<br />\nsuch programs enhance a student's curriculum, and do not<br />\nhinder him from receiving his<br />\ndegree on time. Many institutions now have suitable premed programs which offer<br />\ncomparable courses to those in<br />\nthe U.S., so that a pre-med<br />\nneed not take only electives, but<br />\nrequirements as well.<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\nment with courses in govern- of that one must research on<br />\nment and politics.

Several students<br />\nfelt that the workload was comparable, but emphasized depth<br />\nrather than quantity. They<br />\nfound professors to be knowledgeable and friendly and they<br />\nenjoyed the academic freedom<br />\noffered.<br />\nEveryone agreed that the<br />\nmost important aspect of their<br />\ntime abroad was their opportunity to experience a new<br />\nculture. Advice offered almost<br />\nunanimously: mingle, try new<br />\nthings, use the facilities of the<br />\ninstitution to their fullest. In<br />\nshort, experiment. As one student put it, \"Use this time as<br />\nyour year to do things that are<br />\ndifferent.\"<br />\nTuition for study abroad<br />\nprograms is highly variable, as<br />\nit is paid to the university whose<br />\nprogram one utilizes, or directly<br />\nto the foreign university. It<br />\nshould be noted that students<br />\nleaving as of September, 1984<br />\nmust pay 10% of Hopkins' tuition in addition. The student<br />\nstudying abroad has the status<br />\nof a JHU student on leave.<br />\nStudying abroad, asserts<br />\nWergin, is seen as positive by<br />\nboth Medical and Law schools,<br />\nas well as other graduate institutions. \"It implies a student's ability to plan and to adjust to new environments, and<br />\nis recognized as a worthwhile<br />\nexperience.\" If you are interested in exploring the possibility of studying abroad, you<br />\nwill find friendly assistance at<br />\nthe Office of Advising and<br />\nCounseling. There is a file of<br />\nU.S. and foreign institutions<br />\nthat offer excellent programs.<br />\nIn addition, Wergin holds<br />\na file of questionaires filled out<br />\nby students returning from<br />\noverseas. Answers to questions<br />\nlike \"What were your living arrangements?\" and \"How<br />\nwould you rate the quality of<br />\ninstruction?\" may help you get<br />\na better idea of what to expect<br />\nat a specific institution.<br />\nNow people in virtually all<br />\nmajors can consider taking time<br />\noff from Hopkins, time to<br />\nstudy in a new environment and<br />\nto meet new people. And one<br />\nneed,not fear that this time off<br />\nrepresents a hindrance to one's<br />\nplanned course of study, as<br />\nspecific requirements may be<br />\nfulfilled elsewhere. Says Bill of<br />\nhis year abroad, \"I consider it<br />\nnot only an enjoyable experience, but an asset to my education.\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/15<br /><br />\nSports<br />\nZimmerman Named New Jay Lacrosse Coach<br />\ncont. from p.

The longest<br />\nseason in sports is over, and<br />\nhere are some of the best and<br />\nworst highlights of the year:<br />\nFirst off, congratulations are<br />\ndue to the four division winners: Baltimore, Chicago,<br />\nPhiladelphia, and Los Angeles.<br />\nEach won its division by a<br />\nsizeable margin, but, except for<br />\nChicago, each was tested during August and September and<br />\neach earned the right to play in<br />\nthe playoffs.<br />\nOn the last day of the season,<br />\nthree managers were dismissed<br />\nas a result of their team's performance. The ousting of Harvey Kuenn comes as no surprise<br />\nto any Brewer fan, as general<br />\nmanager Harry Dalton has<br />\nbeen talking about a possible<br />\nmanagerial change for weeks.<br />\nThough former Mariner<br />\nmanager Rene Lachemann<br />\nseems to be the better man for<br />\nthe job, the firing is still an insult to Kuenn, who took a lackluster 1982 Brewer team and<br />\nbrought it its first American<br />\nLeague championship. The<br />\nBrewers this year were without<br />\nthe use of star pitchers Pete<br />\nVuckovich and Rollie Fingers,<br />\nso Kuenn can hardly be blamed<br />\nfor the demise of his pitching<br />\nstaff.<br />\nCharlie Fox resigned as<br />\nmanager of the Cubs to return<br />\nto the front office. He replaced<br />\nLee Ella in mid-season.<br />\nMets general manager Frank<br />\nCashen made another mistake<br />\nin firing manager Frank<br />\nHoward before the Mets' final<br />\ngame. Aside from Earl Weaver,<br />\nthe Mets could not find a better manager than Howard, who<br />\nsucceeded in bringing respectability to a Mets team which<br />\nwas the joke of the league in<br /><br />\nMay. He will be sorely missed.<br />\nWhile on the subject of<br />\nmanagers, one cannot ignore<br />\nthe New York Yankees. Look<br />\nfor Billy Martin to step down<br />\nvoluntarily from the post of<br />\nYankees manager during the<br />\noff-season. Billy has already indicated his displeasure with the<br />\npresent player situation in New<br />\nYork, and is sick of their attitudes and on-field performance.<br />\nOn the brighter side, one can<br />\nexpect Tony LaRussa to be<br />\nnamed as A. L. Manager of the<br />\nYear and Paul Owens to be<br />\nnamed as N. L. Manager of the<br />\nYear. LaRussa has conditioned<br />\nthe White Sox' pitching staff to<br />\na new standard of excellence,<br />\nand Owens blew away the N.

One can only imagine<br />\nwhat Atlanta would have done<br />\nwithout Dale Murphy (.305,<br />\n121 RBI's, 36 HR's, 30 SB), the<br />\nprobable N. L. MVP. Steve<br />\nRogers is destined for the<br />\nN. L.

Senior Geraldine Klauber and junior Ken i Fischer<br />\nproved you wrong last May<br />\nwhen they were invited to the<br />\nNCAA Division 3 Women's<br />\nNational Tennis Championships. Their 12 and I doubles<br />\nrecord, and Klauber's 11 and 2<br />\nsingles record earned them their<br />\nplaces in the draw in sunny<br />\nClaremont, California. Klauber<br />\nwas a veteran of these championships, having played in<br />\nJackson, Mississippi in 1982.<br />\nThat year she played both first<br />\nsingles and doubles with then<br />\nsenior Amy Buchanan.<br />\nThe past May, Klauber and<br />\nFischer lost a heartbreaker in<br />\nthree sets to a pair from U. Cal.<br />\nSan Diego in the first round.<br />\nKlauber remembers it being<br />\n\"really a tight match. It could<br />\nhave easily gone to us in the<br />\nfinal set of the tiebreaker.\" The<br />\nteam they lost to reached the<br />\nquarter finals of the tournament.<br />\nKlauber fared a little better<br /><br />\nplaying first singles. -She won<br />\nthe first round handily (6-3,<br />\n6-3). The second round, played<br />\nthe same day, stopped her cold<br />\n(6-2, 6-1). Not one to make excuses, Klauber didn't complain<br />\nabout the tough scheduling.<br />\nFischer explains, \"She had<br />\nplayed a great match earlier in<br />\nthe day without knowing about<br />\nthe second round. If Geraldine<br />\nhad been in top form she could<br />\nhave done really well.\"<br />\nUnfortunately, the Women's<br /><br />\nNational Championships are<br />\nheld in the spring. Hopkins<br />\nwomen play their regular season in the fall and play only a<br />\nfew tournaments and scrimmages in the spring. This is due<br />\nto the problem of sharing<br />\ncourts with the men (who have<br />\ntheir regular season in the<br />\nspring) and a lack of money.<br />\nCoach Kay Fowler-Dressler<br />\nhopes the school will recognize<br />\ntheir problem and help them<br />\nfind a solution. Klauber and<br /><br />\nFischer hope \"next year we can<br />\nbe more prepared and matchtough. We certainly won't be<br />\nintimidated. The experience last<br />\nMay was invaluable.\"'<br />\nObviously, a free trip to<br />\nCalifornia, and great tennis<br />\nbesides, was a terrific opportunity. Klauber feels the nationals are \"definitely a<br />\nhighlight of my college career.\"<br />\nShe enjoyed the caliber of play,<br />\nalthough, surprisingly, it isn't<br />\nas competitive as the upcoming<br /><br />\n1111114111<br /><br />\nTennis Life Tournament (this<br />\nweekend).<br />\n\"I'm glad I went to the nationals and I'm sure we'll do<br />\neven better next year,\" Fischer<br />\nsaid. \"Hopkins is now a legitimate tennis power. We are definitely in the running for the<br />\nconference championship and<br />\nfor berths at the nationals.\"<br />\nKlauber and Fischer continue<br />\nto lead Hopkins' most successful fall team on to bigger<br />\nand better things.<br /><br />\nNillIti<br /><br />\nBill Meeker<br />\nCeraldine Klauber<br /><br />\nFran Mullan<br />\ncont. front p. 18<br />\nto outside linebacker, Mullan<br />\nhas been a starter for the last<br />\nthree years.<br />\nDuring the off season, Fran<br />\noccupies himself by running<br />\nand lifting weights.

He wrestled<br />\nfor Hopkins as a freshman, but<br />\nwas forced to stop because of<br />\na wrist injury.<br />\nWhen asked about the future<br />\nof the football team, Mullan<br />\nwas optimistic. \"We've gotten<br />\noff to a slow start this year, but<br />\nwe're a much better team than<br />\nour record shows.\" Part of the<br />\nproblem may be due to the injuries to three of the Blue Jay<br />\nstarters. \"We've had a good<br />\nrecruiting year,\" said Mullan.<br />\n\"And there are only ten seniors<br />\non the team.
