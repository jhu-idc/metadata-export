For<br />\nexample, the nine-page story on<br />\nthe Five-Year Plan in the<br />\nFebruary '89 issue presented<br />\ncoverage of this controversial<br />\nplan and its possible impact on the<br />\nUniversity in more detail than did<br />\nthe Washington Post or the<br />\nBaltimore Sun.

Hancock saw this narrowed focus as an acute problem<br />\nsince \"the magazine is the<br />\nUniversity's external voice.\"<br />\nAssociate Editor Julia Ridgely<br />\nadded that the magazine needed<br />\nto cover a broader range of campus events and life at Hopkins in<br />\ngeneral because only about half<br />\nof the magazine's readers live in<br />\nthe Baltimore area. The remainder are from out of state, and<br />\nabout 5,000 readers live<br />\noverseas; therefore, Ridgely explained, the magazine should express \"what it would be like to<br />\ngo to Hopkins\" and give \"the<br />\nfeel of the University.\"<br />\nWith Hancock back as editor,<br />\nJones felt that there would be no<br />\nradical change in the magazine's<br />\noperation.

If the Union<br />\nwere to be a good one I think it<br />\nwould definitely improve student<br />\nlife, but from what I've heard I<br />\ndon't think it's a good idea.\"<br />\nOther students were concerned about when the Union would<br />\nbe ready, feeling that it wouldn't<br />\nbe fair to charge current students<br />\nif they weren't going to benefit<br />\nfrom the facility. Freshman<br />\nJonathan Cohen strongly agreed,<br />\nestimating that \"it probably won't<br />\nbenefit anybody for 10 years.\"<br />\nDelacruz suggested, \"If the Student Union takes a long time it<br />\nshould be a staggered fee where<br />\npeople who will be able to enjoy<br />\nit will pay more.\"<br />\nStudent-run radio received<br />\ngeneral approval. Freshman<br />\nEthan Imboden, a disc jockey<br />\nfrom Berkeley, California, said<br />\nthat he is \"all for the radio station idea.

Too much emphasis is put on graduate studies<br />\nand research. Another concern is<br />\nthe inability of the foreign TAs<br />\nto express their thoughts<br />\ncoherently.

The two<br />\nstrangers stared at him, making<br />\nthe man extremely uncomfortable., until finally one of the two<br />\nstrangers leaned over to the other<br />\nand whispered something to him,<br />\npointing at the man. The two<br />\nstrangers laughed, and the second<br />\nstranger then<br />\nwhispered<br />\nsomething to the first. The<br />\nstrangers laughed again.<br />\nNeedless to say, the man was<br />\nsomewhat unsettled by the whole<br />\nmatter, and in fact as the whispering picked up, his temper rose.<br />\nFinally, infuriated, he tapped the<br />\nshoulder of the old woman seated<br />\nnext to him, indicated the two<br />\nstrangers, and pretended to<br />\nwhisper in her ear. Obviously the<br />\nold woman had no idea what he<br />\nwas doing, and as such looked at<br />\nhim curiously. The two strangers,<br />\nhowever, believed that the old<br />\nwoman's expression was a<br />\nresponse to something the man<br />\ndid.<br />\nWhen the man got off the bus,<br />\nthe two strangers got off with him<br />\nand demanded to know what he<br />\nhad told the old woman. The man<br />\ntried to explain to them that he<br />\nhad said nothing, but the two<br />\ndidn't believe him.<br />\nI don't remember the rest of the<br />\njoke, but I remember thinking of<br />\nthe joke in third grade when I was<br />\ntrying to get back at Mike Bunk<br />\nand Rob VanBuskirk.<br />\nI was always a painfully honest<br />\nchild. I had no secrets. I told<br />\neverybody everything. That's<br />\nprobably why, for much of my<br />\ngrade school career, I was known<br />\nas \"Mouth.\"<br />\nIt's not that I liked telling on<br />\npeople, or spreading gossip<br />\n(though certainly now I enjoy<br />\nthose things), it's just that I<br />\ncouldn't figure out why anybody<br />\nwould keep anything from<br />\nanybody else. That and the fact<br />\nthat I was incredibly curious<br />\nabout everything (though I was<br />\ntold that I was too old to be<br />\n<br />\nMaking us all look good<br />\nWhen U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos speaks<br />\nnext Thursday at Shriver Hall, he will lead one of the most<br />\nimpressive batteries of speakers ever to gather for the MSE<br />\nSymposium. This current series is striking not merely for<br />\nquality speakers\u2014some of America's leading thinkers\u2014<br />\nbut for the unique combination of perspectives they represent. It's a combination particularly well-suited to address<br />\nthe future of higher education in the United States. But<br />\nthese speakers, to be sure, were not lured to Hopkins by<br />\nthe elegance of its campus. Their presence is the product<br />\nof a full year's work by the Symposium co-chairs, Jeffrey Blitz and Andrea Kaufman.<br />\nBlitz and Kaufman began preparing this year's program<br />\nimmediately upon their selection last fall. The two had to<br />\narticulate a unifying Symposium theme\u2014this without any<br />\ncommitments from potential speakers\u2014and then construct<br />\nthe series of lectures from there. It was hardly an enviable<br />\ntask<br />\nThe Symposium co-chairs not only gave up their summers and intersessions, but gave, too, fifteen hours of their<br />\ntime every week throughout the academic year. Blitz and<br />\nKaufman acted as the Symposium's full-time administrative<br />\nand secretarial staff. They established an Advisory Board<br />\nof Professors and Administrators, sent hundreds of letters,<br />\nmade an equal number of phone calls and, as Kaufman<br />\nobserved, had \"to account for everything that may happen, and everything that's not going to happen.\"<br />\nFrustrating cases in point were the death of a contracted<br />\nSymposium speaker\u2014A. Bartlett Giamatti\u2014and the failure<br />\nof a major grant proposal, despite a month of preparation.<br />\nSimultaneously, all of this had to be coordinated with<br />\nthe School of Arts and Sciences and the University's<br />\nDevelopment Office, so that none of the Symposium's fundraising would conflict with previous capital campaigns.<br />\nThe co-chairs were also faced with responsibility for arranging itineraries and accomodations for the speakers,<br />\nas well as coordinating dinners, choosing appropriate dinner guests, sending dinner invitations, picking up the<br />\nspeakers from their various airports and train stations,<br />\ncoordinating tours, arranging for electricians and<br />\ncarpenters to prepare Shriver Hall, reserving rooms at the<br />\noverbooked Homewood campus\u2014all the while aware that<br />\nthey were representing the Johns Hopkins University and<br />\neverything that that entails.<br />\nUltimately, Blitz and Kaufman were highly visible<br />\nrepresentatives of Johns Hopkins undergraduate education.<br />\n<br />\nby Christopher T. McColl<br />\n<br />\ncurious\u2014I was nosy instead).<br />\nMore than once I was knocked by<br />\nmy father and mother for wanting<br />\nto know how old one of their<br />\nfriends was, after that friend had<br />\nasked the same information of<br />\nme.<br />\nAnyway, my friends knew I<br />\ntalked. So they stopped telling me<br />\nthings. It didn't bother me at first,<br />\nmostly because I didn't know it<br />\nwas going on. I talked about<br />\nmyself for as long as my information held out (this was around<br />\nthe time that I was thought of as<br />\nconceited). But how much does<br />\na third-grader have to say about<br />\nhimself'? So, I tried to get in good<br />\nwith my friends again, to find out<br />\nwhat was up with them.<br />\nI was at a disadvantage, and my<br />\nfriends knew it. Mike Bunk and<br />\nRob VanBuskirk in particular. I'd<br />\ngo to the playground with them<br />\nevery day, and every day they'd<br />\nwalk two steps away from me and<br />\nstart whispering.<br />\n\"What're you guys talking<br />\nabout?\"<br />\n\"Nothing. (psst-pssst. Pssspsss-psst).\"<br />\n\"C'mon, you guys. What're<br />\nyou saying?\"<br />\n\"Nothing, Mouth. Ha-ha (psst)<br />\nHa-ha.\"<br />\n'I'll tell!'\"<br />\nWhich in itself was amusing.<br />\nwas going to tell . . . what? That<br />\nwas my whole problem: my<br />\nfriends had stuff to tell and I<br />\ndidn't. I spent hours in introversion and distraction trying to<br />\nfigure out what it was was my<br />\nfriends had been whispering<br />\nabout (it was around this time that<br />\nmy friends started saying that I<br />\nwas acting quiet and weird). In<br />\nmy daze, I often bungled everyday activities, such as brushing<br />\nmy hair or answering the phone.<br />\n\"Chris, why didn't you tell me<br />\nMrs. So-and-So called?\"<br />\n\"I'm sorry, Mom, I forgot.<br />\nRob and Mike were telling secrets<br />\naround me and I got really mad.\"<br />\n\"Well, it was probably things<br />\nyou don't need to know, then.<br />\nBesides, what does that have to<br />\ndo with you not giving me Mrs.<br />\nSo-and-So's message?\"<br />\n<br />\nWell, I was thinking, and I just<br />\nforgot. You forget stuff too, you<br />\nknow, like when you forgot the<br />\npunchline to that joke about the<br />\nguy on the bus\u2014\"<br />\n\"That's not important. There<br />\nare things that are important\u2014<br />\nthings I need to know. Don't do<br />\nthat again. Now go fix your<br />\nhair.\"<br />\nSo not only was I not supposed to tell everybody<br />\neverything (because I'd run out<br />\nof stuff to say), and not only was<br />\nit not necessary for everybody to<br />\ntell me everything (so Rob. and<br />\nMike could tell secrets around<br />\nme), but I was expected to know<br />\nwhat information was vital and<br />\nwhat was not.<br />\nOf course, there are those instances when it is obvious what<br />\nshould be concealed, such as<br />\nwhen your best friend calls in sick<br />\nto work (at the same bookstore<br />\nwhere you work), and you get<br />\ncalled in to sub on a Saturday<br />\nmorning, and as you go out to<br />\nyour bike you see him coming out<br />\nof your other friend's house two<br />\ndoors down getting into his '57<br />\nChevy Bel-Air with some bleached blonde. In this case, you<br />\nwithhold the information from<br />\nyour boss, though you might take<br />\nit up later with your friend.<br />\nThis is, of course, a lie. It is<br />\nnot the Outright Lie (\"I can't<br />\ncome in to work today, I'm<br />\nsick\"), nor the Little White Lie<br />\n(\"Come on, Chris, won't you<br />\nplease come in? You're one of the<br />\nbest employees we've got\"), and<br />\nmuch ambiguity has shrouded this<br />\nquestion over the years, but rest<br />\nassured, it's a Lie. For, Lying<br />\ndoes not always involve telling an<br />\nuntruth; Lying comes from concealing the truth, even though you<br />\nknow it.<br />\nBut, then, that's what growing<br />\nup is all about. Learning when<br />\nnot to say things (learning when<br />\nto lie, I suppose, though that's an<br />\nugly way of expressing it). After<br />\nall, how many of us have laughed at how cute kids are when they<br />\ndon't realize what they've said<br />\n(for examples, see Art Linkletter's Kids Say the Darndest<br />\n<br />\nThings)?<br />\nWorking in a bookstore, you<br />\nhave a lot of time to talk to your<br />\nfellow cashiers. About a lot of<br />\nstuff. Conversation is like that: it<br />\ncan cover a wide array of subjects. However, having grown up<br />\nwondering what other people are<br />\nwhispering about, one tends not<br />\nto pay much attention to the etiquette of chat, one tends not to<br />\nknow which subjects are taboo.<br />\n\"So, Chris, what'd you do this<br />\nweekend?\"<br />\n\"I went shopping.\"<br />\n\"Oh, how fun. What'd you<br />\nbuy?\"<br />\n\"Boxers.\"<br />\n\"Er, uh, excuse me? You<br />\nmean like underwear?\"<br />\n\"Yeah\u2014they're really cool.<br />\nOne pair has Fred Flintstone and<br />\nDino on them, and another<br />\nhas\u2014\"<br />\n\"Uh, right. Listen, Chris, can<br />\nyou do the shelving over there?<br />\nDebby, that bleached blonde we<br />\njust hired, called in sick the day<br />\nright after Fred did, and it didn't<br />\nget done.\"<br />\nIt turns out that not telling<br />\nthings about one's self is the key<br />\nto surviving in society. Unless<br />\none wants to be talked about, one<br />\nhad best not discuss one's self. To<br />\nthis day I think my assistant<br />\nmanager tells her friends about<br />\nthe weirdo who tried to talk boxers with her one day.<br />\nYou see, if you talk about<br />\nyourself too often, you become a<br />\ntopic of conversation for others.<br />\nIf you put yourself in the public<br />\neye, people cannot help but look<br />\nat you.<br />\nTalking about others is a<br />\ndefense, of course, since you<br />\ncan't discuss your own secrets<br />\nwhen you're discussing someone<br />\nelse's\u2014the same way that you<br />\ncan't think and remember a punchline at the same time you're<br />\ntelling the joke. You have to<br />\nfigure out a way to release information about yourself without<br />\ndrawing attention to it.(A fiction<br />\nwriter might use parentheses to<br />\nconceal information from the<br />\nSee PUNCH, 8<br />\n<br />\nTheir striking combination of competence and imagination, like that of their predecessors, will add far more luster<br />\nto a Hopkins diploma than any amount of Admissions Office hyperbole. On behalf of Hopkins undergraduates, the<br />\nNews-Letter would like to extend thanks to Blitz and Kaufman for a job well done.<br />\n<br />\nInsulting fees<br />\nThe proposal by some members of Student Council to<br />\nlevy an activities fee on Hopkins students is an insult. As<br />\ntuition rises past the $14,000 mark, are we now expected<br />\nto pay additional money for programs that should be included in the whopping sum we already shell out each fall<br />\nand spring?<br />\nSome may think, reasonably, that the additional fee is<br />\ninconsiderable in light of the thousands of dollars spent<br />\nduring an academic year. But it is the governing principle<br />\nbehind the fee that matters. Hopkins' tuition has increased by an average of eight percent annually in recent years,<br />\nwhile class sizes have increased, course offerings have<br />\nshrunken and inadequate facilities have remained just that.<br />\nThis ironic \"pay more and get less\" situation is not our<br />\nresponsibility. Yet we are the ones who suffer for it, and<br />\nwho are expected to solve it by surrendering increasingly<br />\nmore money to the school.<br />\nThe ostensible reason for proposing the fee is to increase<br />\nsocial programming\u2014a laudable cause. Unfortunately,<br />\nmany view the fee as a means to generate funds for a student union and other grandiose projects\u2014projects which,<br />\nalthough needed, are the University's responsibity to<br />\nsupply.<br />\nIn examining proposed plans for a new union funded<br />\nby a fee, there are several problems. First, 2700 students<br />\nweighing in at $25 each would yield $135,000 a year, hardly enough for both programming and construction. Second,<br />\nbuilding an adequate facility would take years, and the<br />\nmoney spent by current students will most likely not benefit<br />\nthem directly, but rather, students of a distant, more<br />\ncrowded Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nWe don't deny the need for more social programming,<br />\nnor the desire for a firm Hopkins community. We do deny<br />\nthe possible imposition of yet more fees, no matter how<br />\nsmall, which exist solely to relieve the University of its<br />\nresponsibility to its students.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nTolerantly understanding...<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nGreater than any fear that I<br />\nmight have about the dangers of<br />\nintolerance on our campus are the<br />\nfears that I have about the dangers<br />\nof ignorance. This ignorance is<br />\nperpetuated by the dishonesty that<br />\nI see conducted in our public<br />\ndiscourse, particularly in the last<br />\ntwo issues of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity News-Letter.<br />\nA discussion of two major<br />\nissues, drug abuse and intolerance, was begun by a letter<br />\nwriter who did not have anything<br />\noriginal to say about the first issue<br />\nbut in the nature of the presentation of his/her argument, said a<br />\nlot about the second issue. The<br />\napologetics of the accompanying<br />\neditorial did little to clarify either<br />\nthe nature of drug abuse or intolerance at Hopkins but further<br />\nclouded the air with references to<br />\nprevious incidences of abuse by<br />\nmembers of fraternities.<br />\nThe following week's letters on<br />\nthe above subjects were no less<br />\nrevealing. Anyone unfamiliar<br />\nwith the nature of the social<br />\nculture of the United States would<br />\nbelieve, after reading last week's<br />\nletters on our Greek organizations, that the sytem of PTA's in<br />\nAmerican high schools is an<br />\nanalogous institution; both have<br />\ncharitable fund-raisers, members<br />\nof both are upstanding members<br />\nof the community and both are<br />\nvery touchy when criticized.<br />\nIt seems that the original shot<br />\nin this volley of words was fired<br />\nby an individual who wished to<br />\ncreate a discussion without any of<br />\nthe risks inherent in taking a<br />\nstand. This in my mind, was a<br />\nblind submission to the intolerance that he/she was trying<br />\nto escape. By speaking from<br />\nanonymity the author expressed<br />\nan unwillingness to defend the<br />\nveracity of his/her words that<br />\nundermines the validity of his/her<br />\nargument. In that the author's<br />\n<br />\nclaims are unsubstantiated and<br />\nunwitnessed, even by the author<br />\nhim/herself, they are in essence,<br />\nuntrue.<br />\nThe News-Letter advanced the<br />\npremises that fraternities are<br />\nresponsible for the actions of its<br />\nindividual members and that<br />\nsome of their members are guilty of crimes of intolerance. In the<br />\nlanguage of the editorial and the<br />\nact of hiding the identity of the<br />\nauthor of the accompanying letter, the News-Letter identifies the<br />\nGreek system at Hopkins, with all<br />\nits strengths and weaknesses, as<br />\nthe locus of an immense,<br />\nthreatening force that can act with<br />\nimpunity\u2014an assertion that is<br />\nfalse.<br />\nFinally, the representatives of<br />\nfraternities and sororities, in letters of varying degrees of honesty, described the nature of their<br />\norganizations. Even as communities within a community,<br />\nGreek organizations are not exempt from the rules of the community as a whole. When<br />\nmembers of the Greek system insult, offend, or break the laws of<br />\nthe greater community, an individual or his/her chapter is<br />\npunished. To claim that all<br />\nmembers of fraternities and<br />\nsororities are exemplary in their<br />\nbehavior, is false.<br />\nIt is incumbent on us, as individuals in society, to make<br />\nresponsible decisions about what<br />\nwe do and what we say. The<br />\ndiscussion of issues such as drug<br />\nabuse, intolerance and the<br />\nlegitimacy of the Greek system<br />\nwould be better served if its participants refrained from making<br />\nungrounded remarks, unfounded<br />\nexaggerations, and untrue assertions.

Granted, Spring Fair is<br />\na fun event that a great population of the Hopkins community<br />\nparticipates in. Yet, MCATs will<br />\ninfluence the futures of two hundred potentially promising<br />\nfutures. To put Spring Fair on the<br />\nsame date as MCATs would be<br />\na colossal error in judgment and<br />\na frightening statement of our<br />\npriorities.<br />\nThe MCAT is a stressful time<br />\nfor the students who take the exam. They don't need it to be<br />\nmade more difficult for them by<br />\nthe myriad scents and sounds that<br />\nare inevitably produced by Spring<br />\nFair. To put Fair on the same date<br />\nas MCATs would needlessly<br />\njeopardize the mental state of<br />\nthose taking the exam.<br />\nIt must be kept in mind,<br />\nhowever, despite this issue's<br />\nseemingly limited salience to premeds that the decision made by<br />\nthe Student Council affects<br />\neveryone. What if the LSATs,<br />\nGREs, or GMATs were on that<br />\nday?

In other<br />\nwords, this will set students' rent<br />\nlevels back to about what they<br />\nwere last year.<br />\nThough this subsidy is open to<br />\nboth American and foreign<br />\nstudents, it is especially pertinent<br />\nto the latter (and consequently is<br />\nsomewhat easier to obtain).<br />\nUniversity housing has, in the<br />\nbody of foreign students that<br />\ncome across every year,<br />\nsomething of a captive market.<br />\nThis is in the opinion of some,<br />\nyour editor included, a situation<br />\nit exploits. As I well remember<br />\nfrom two-and-a-bit years ago, for<br />\nforeigners the prospect of traveling several thousand miles only<br />\nto be faced with the prospect of<br />\nhaving to look for an apartment<br />\non arrival is a daunting one. This<br />\nis a fear the Housing Office happily plays on by downplaying the<br />\ncost of its own housing, and making no mention whatsoever of the<br />\nrelative ease of finding private accommodation in Baltimore. To<br />\nquote from a bit of bumf I received way back in May 1987,<br />\n\"University-owned accommodations are usually less expensive<br />\nthan off-campus housing.\"<br />\nThough the Housing Office's<br />\nclaims may once have resembled something akin to the truth,<br />\nthey no longer do, plain and simple. Square foot for square foot,<br />\nprivate accommodation is<br />\ngenerally far cheaper than<br />\nUniversity accommodation of a<br />\nsimilar standard. But, from 3000<br />\nmiles away, one isn't to know<br />\n<br />\nthat. So one signs along the dotted line, only to find oneself being fleeced on arrival.<br />\nAnyway, the powers that be<br />\nhave recognized this fact (albeit<br />\nprobably in less strident<br />\nlanguage).

Take this summer<br />\nin north central New Mexico, for<br />\nexample. I was camped up in the<br />\nSangre de Cristo mountains near<br />\nthe Colorado border for three<br />\nweeks. Nearby is a construction<br />\nproject to rebuild a 70-year-old<br />\nearthen dam that has begun to<br />\nleak excessively. As is the case<br />\nin any such construction project,<br />\nthere is a need for numerous<br />\nheavy equipment operators and<br />\nother blue-collar types. The labor<br />\npool of the nearby towns of<br />\nCostilla and Questa are not large<br />\nenough to fill the demand, so<br />\nworkers from surrounding areas<br />\n(as far as California) migrate into the Costilla Valley for these<br />\nfairly well-paying jobs. Most rent<br />\nsome form of housing near the<br />\ntown of Costilla, but the individual of interest, the topic of<br />\ntoday's column, lives in his 1982<br />\nDodge van. It's actually quite efficient; he has a nice bed in the<br />\nback so he can pull off the road<br />\nanywhere and get a good sleep.<br />\nHe only need drive the 20 miles<br />\ninto Costilla every two or three<br />\ndays when supplies need<br />\nreplenishing, rather than every<br />\nday like the rest of the workers.<br />\nMy camp spot was attractive and<br />\nclose to the dam, so he often<br />\nparked his van there to sleep.<br />\nSince we were both alone out<br />\nthere we naturally engaged in<br />\nsome conversations.<br />\nThis guy never did tell me his<br />\nname; I'll just refer to him as<br />\nHolmes. Holmes is in his late<br />\n20's. I guess one could call him<br />\na drifter. He travels around the<br />\nWest from construction job to<br />\nconstruction job. Once he builds<br />\nup some cash, he quits his job and<br />\ntravels around doing what he enjoys, mostly hunting. He then<br />\nfinds a new job when his cash<br />\nruns out. It's really not a bad<br />\nlifestyle when you think about it.<br />\nPerhaps Holmes' lust for hunting<br />\nexplains his belief that \"Guns are<br />\nwhat made America America.\"<br />\nYou would not have found this<br />\n<br />\nguy voting for Maryland measure<br />\n-3 last November. But you probably wouldn't have found<br />\nHolmes in Maryland anyway; he<br />\ndoesn't think much of this part of<br />\nthe country.

Whaddya think of that place?\"<br />\n\"Oh, it's OK for going to<br />\nschool, but I wouldn't want to<br />\nlive there forever.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, I've been there before.<br />\nThat place is just a big<br />\nclusterf---.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, I know what you<br />\nmean. Lots of people around<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nHolmes asks, \"Have you ever<br />\ndone any fishing up here?\"<br />\n\"No, I've never been into<br />\nfishing too much. Plus, I want to<br />\nget my geology work done and<br />\nget out of here.\"<br />\n\"A couple weeks ago me and<br />\nanother guy went hand fishing.<br />\nEver gone hand fishing?\"<br />\n\"No. You mean you can just<br />\ngrab the fish out of the water?\"<br />\n\"Sure. They hide under the<br />\nstream banks. Just reach under<br />\nand you're sure to find a fish. We<br />\ntook out about 50 that one day.\"<br />\nAt this time I recalled the<br />\nnumerous signs posted along<br />\nCostilla Creek: Special trout<br />\nwater.

Total bill:<br />\n$32.00, $36.00 with tip. This is<br />\nhow long it took us to be seated:<br />\ntwo minutes.(The couple behind<br />\nus in line: 40 minutes.)<br />\nThe place seemed less eccentric than we'd expected; it seemed like a place we could bring our<br />\nparents. But then, maybe our<br />\nparents are just tremendously<br />\ncool. The walls were pale rose,<br />\nand the artwork was pastel landscapes. The waitresses wore matching black tank tops to confuse<br />\nus, and tables came with brown<br />\npaper tablecloths, and a mugful<br />\nof crayons to draw with. Diner<br />\nNumber One said when she saw<br />\nthe crayons, \"Oooh\u2014I bet this<br />\nmeans a long wait for the food,\"<br />\nand of course she was right, but<br />\nthen she's from New York where<br />\nI hear all the restaurants have<br />\ncrayons at their tables.<br />\nThings like long waits for food<br />\ncan be forgiven when you are<br />\ngrateful to get a table at all, let<br />\nalone in two minutes. There was<br />\nlots to watch: the artwork mentioned above improved with gazing, the scrawlings taking shape<br />\nunder our various sets of fingers,<br />\nthe waiters and waitresses walking by, the people next to us and<br />\ntheir food, which certainly looked good.<br />\nDiner Number Two, an<br />\nengineer, had drawn a series of<br />\nsine curves and round pigs by the<br />\ntime the nachos and the chili arrived. The nachos seemed more<br />\nlike an open tortilla with beans,<br />\ncheese and vegetables (and sour<br />\ncream on the side) than the usual<br />\nchips. They were good,they were<br />\nmore than good, they were the<br />\nbest thing of the evening as it<br />\nturned out.

When<br />\nwe caught her again we ordered<br />\ncoffees and a sopaipilla.

The first of these, \"Visitor<br />\nfrom New York,\" introduces William Warren<br />\n(Lyle Roberts), a 45-year-old divorcee who drinks<br />\ntea instead of liquor, has given up on cigarettes<br />\nand Snickers bars, runs five miles and swims<br />\ntwenty laps a day, and eats organically-grown<br />\nfood.<br />\nA native New Yorker, William goes to the suite<br />\nto visit his first ex-wife, Hannah (Sarah Morton),<br />\nwho has trekked to California to persuade their<br />\nonly daughter to return with her to New York.<br />\n42 years old, still living in New York, Hannah<br />\neats chili burgers\u2014on wheat bread, she informs<br />\n<br />\nhim with a sneer\u2014and visits her analyst regularly. She buries her emotions under a dense layer<br />\nof caustic, sarcastic remark\u2014what Billy (as she<br />\ndubs him) calls her \"train of venom.\" Despite<br />\nthe facade, Hannah eventually reveals her warmer<br />\nside: that of a caring mother scared at the notion<br />\nof losing her daughter.<br />\nMorton and Roberts were both successful in<br />\nproviding the audience with a keen sense of the<br />\nshifting emotions between them.'Although there<br />\nwere some uneasy black spaces in dialogue, both<br />\nactors had some poignant moments. Roberts spoke<br />\nwell and came across convincingly, and Morton<br />\nat times offered piercing glimpses of the pain<br />\nbehind Hannah's rough exterior. Near the end of<br />\nthe scene, she admits to Billy, \"I'm not always<br />\nfond of me, either,\" and the line resonates strongly with all that we've seen.<br />\n\"She was attractive,\" says Marvin Michaels in<br />\nscene two of the play. \"She was a little tight and<br />\nshe was paid for.\" This is Michaels' explanation<br />\nto his wife, Millie (Elin Hilderbrand), for the unconscious prostitute (Aliza Lirtzman) lying dormant in the suite's double bed. The Michaels, who<br />\nhave come from Philadelphia for their nephew's<br />\nbar mitzvah, are a couple who plan for the worst<br />\nin life: they take separate flights out to California so as not to risk making their children orphans.<br />\n<br />\nElisse Takara<br />\n<br />\nSarah Morton (left) and Lyle Roberts in the Hopkins Barnstormers' recent production of Neil Simon's<br />\n\"California Suite\"<br />\nThe scene centers on Marvin's attempts to conceal the prostitute from his wife, and then, after<br />\nhe confesses the truth, on her reaction to the news.<br />\n,The scene is good\u2014fast-paced and sharp\u2014and<br />\nMcColl and Hilderbrand aptly underscore its<br />\nhumor. McColl's frantic portrayal of Marvin and<br />\nHilderbrand's thick Jewish accent\u2014it sounds, oddly, like something right out of Brooklyn\u2014add considerable color to the play.<br />\nThe play's third scene might be considered the<br />\nmost \"Hollywoodian\" of the lot; the London couple at its center has travelled there for the Oscars<br />\nbroadcast.

But because<br />\nweird doesn't necessarily mean good, the<br />\nAcademy sits mute\u2014and with good reason. Annaud, who directed the notably wordless \"Quest<br />\nfor Fire,\" here takes one step up the evolutionary<br />\nladder, from cavemen to bears. While the result<br />\nis admirably fresh, the exercise seems intended<br />\nmore to satisfy the director than to enlighten the<br />\npublic.<br />\nThere are plenty of bear antics and less than two<br />\ndozen lines of dialogue in \"The Bear.\" From the<br />\nfirst, it's bears and more bears, although there is<br />\nsome strong supporting work by other members<br />\nof the animal kingdom\u2014deer, frogs, dogs, chipmunks, horses, and a brilliant puma cameo in the<br />\n<br />\nMarianne Rosentiehl<br />\n<br />\nTwo bears in a scene from, well, \"The Bear\"<br />\nfinale. \"The Bear\" is definitely a film that shows,<br />\nrather than tells, its story to the audience.<br />\nAnd the story here is so simple that it defies<br />\ncomplex description. Bear cub Youk and his<br />\nmother enjoy honey as much as the next bear; in<br />\nfact, a taste for honey is perhaps the only bear<br />\ncliche there is. But in \"Winnie the Pooh,\" for<br />\nexample, main characters aren't crushed by<br />\nboulders while looking for it, as Youk's mother<br />\n<br />\nis here.<br />\nThese are the opening scenes of \"The Bear,\"<br />\nand they are remarkably expressive, considering<br />\nthat not a single word is spoken in the first fiften minutes. Youk's mother lies dead beneath<br />\nthe boulder that took her life, Youk lies next to<br />\nher, still swatting at an occasional bee. He uses<br />\nhis hind legs to stand up, but his head remains<br />\nresting on his mother's fur. It's a great piece of,<br />\n<br />\n(Kerry Tesoriero) has been nominated for one of<br />\nthe coveted statuettes. She has come with her husband Sidney (Christopher McColl), an antique<br />\ndealer and former actor with a good deal of affection for his wife, although he is a \"homosexualbisexual.\"<br />\nTesoriero meets the challenge of expressing her<br />\ncharacter's nervousness well, as seen when she<br />\nannounces, before leaving, 'I have a hump on my<br />\nthroat and a lump in my back.\" The nonchalance<br />\nthat McColl gives to his character, combined with<br />\nhis British accent, gives the scene a good deal of<br />\nSee THEATER, 14<br />\ner, acting.<br />\nYouk's story is much more interesting than that<br />\nof Kaar, the second bear Annaud introduces. Kaar<br />\nis an eighteen-wheeler of a Kodiak bear who has<br />\nbeen wounded in the shoulder by a hunter. Youk<br />\nand Kaar meet in the mountains and, after exchanging some traditional tongue-lapping, they set<br />\noff together, forced into a final confrontation with<br />\ntheir pursuers.<br />\nIt's all very pleasant to watch, but the film has<br />\nsome obvious limitations. Annaud and his team<br />\nof trainers certainly do a job with the animals; Jim<br />\nHenson's animatronic bears are necessary only<br />\nwhen Youk eats some hallucinogenic mushrooms<br />\nand dreams about flying bears. The real bears in<br />\nthe film amaze with their versatility and emotion:<br />\nKnar, for example, was taught to limp for two<br />\nyears. But how many different facial expressions<br />\ncan a bear muster? And what conclusions should<br />\nwe draw from the fact that bears make the same<br />\nsounds while mating and while nursing gunshot<br />\nwounds?<br />\nThere are some logistical problems with \"The<br />\nBear,\" as well. At one point, Youk hurtles down<br />\na stretch of rapids, then grabs hold of a rock in<br />\nthe middle of the river. When we next see him,<br />\nhe is frolicking on the prairie, chasing a chipmunk<br />\nand eating those mushrooms. Yet it may be easy<br />\nto gloss over these lapses in \"plot\" since Youk<br />\nis, well, just so doggone cute.<br />\nNo one said that baby bears were smart. Perhaps<br />\nthe saddest moment in \"The Bear\" comes when<br />\nYouk is captured by hunters, and falls asleep on<br />\nSee MOVIES, 14<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Air Line Tickets\u2022Amtrak \u2022InternationalExperts\u2022Tour Packages\u2022 Cruises\u2022Free VIP.

It's a<br />\nremarkable piece of world<br />\nhistory, full of intrigue and conflict, although the presentation<br />\nhere is a major disappointment.<br />\nThe script is so laborious and<br />\nevasive that \"Fat Man and Little<br />\nBoy\" generates neither light nor<br />\nheat.<br />\n\"Fat Man\" and \"Little Boy\"<br />\nare the nicknames for the atomic<br />\ndevices themselves, subsequently dropped over Nagasaki and<br />\nHiroshima. Less than one year<br />\nafter the Japanese bombing of<br />\nPearl Habor, dozens of young<br />\nscientists were brought to New<br />\nMexico by the United States<br />\nGovernment. Quarantined in justfounded Los Alamos, the goal of<br />\nthe Manhattan Project was to<br />\ndevelop nuclear technology as<br />\nquickly and secretly as possible.<br />\nThe physicists and civilians in<br />\nLos Alamos were only able to see<br />\nfamily members periodically, and<br />\nwere forbidden to divulge details<br />\nof their work. The sacrifices that<br />\n<br />\nthe Manhattan Project involved are a good example of the<br />\nextraordinary lengths to which a<br />\ncountry will extend itself during<br />\nwartime. Unfortunately, few of<br />\nthese special circumstances are<br />\nconveyed in the film.<br />\nThe title of the film is also a<br />\nmetaphor for political and scientific fathers of the bomb. General<br />\nLeslie R. Groves (Paul Newman,<br />\nwearing fifteen pounds of padding around his waist) is the<br />\nmilitary ringmaster in New Mexico. He's got one watchful eye on<br />\nhis deadlines, another on the progress of the international team of<br />\nscientists he's assembled.<br />\nPrecocious physicist J. Robert<br />\nOppenheimer(Dwight Schultz) is<br />\nthe \"Little Boy,\" questioning any<br />\nof Groves' administrative decisions that might cramp the<br />\nabilities of his underlings.<br />\n\"Oppy,\" as he's called, buys<br />\ninto the project quickly\u2014perhaps<br />\ntoo quickly. This is representative<br />\nof the film's major flaw: it tells<br />\nus plenty that we don't need to<br />\nknow in an effort to flesh out the<br />\n\"spectacle\" while omitting the<br />\nvital machinations of the main<br />\ncharacters.<br />\n<br />\nPeter Sorel<br />\n<br />\nPaul Newman in \"Fat Man and Little Boy\"\u2014not his best work<br />\n<br />\nAt Los Alamos, Oppy leads his<br />\ncadre of atomic worker bees<br />\naround like a young high school<br />\nphysics professor. Strangely, Oppy seems to already know how to<br />\nbuild the bomb, but he gooses his<br />\nstudents along, nonetheless, in<br />\nsome sort of practical characterbuilding exercise. Schultz is trying hard, which luckily fits the<br />\ncharacter. Oppy is energetic and<br />\nultimately torn between the<br />\nmorality of the bomb and the<br />\nweight of his commitment.<br />\nUnfortunately, Joffe turns these<br />\ndramatics into a kind of Atomic<br />\nBomb Summer Camp, replete<br />\nwith baseball games and corny<br />\nromances. Isn't there a war going on? The relationship involves<br />\nyoung physicist Michael Merriman (John Cusack) and pristine<br />\nnurse Kathleen Robinson (Laura<br />\nDern), who watches Merriman<br />\ndie a miserable death from radia-<br />\n<br />\ntion poisoning.<br />\nLike all of the civilians at Los<br />\nAlamos, Kathleen is not permitted to know what the project entails. She can only guess at what<br />\nhas happened to Merriman's<br />\ntwisted and bloated body. The<br />\nromantic subplot is here to give<br />\nthe scientists human depth, but it<br />\nhas the opposite effect: the<br />\ncivilians look like idiots.<br />\n<br />\nCusack, likable but hardly inspiring, begins the downhill slide<br />\nin \"Fat Man and Little Boy,\" as<br />\nhe is completely miscast.

But,<br />\nlike most people with a mission,<br />\nthey sacrifice their time willingly. Zealots? Perhaps. But when<br />\nthe mission is to bolster the muchlamented social life at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, few steps<br />\ncan be considered too drastic.<br />\nMost Hopkins students aren't<br />\naware that Chester's Place, one<br />\nof the most consistent sources of<br />\nentertainment on campus, has<br />\nbeen presenting live music in the<br />\nLittle Theater for almost twenty<br />\nyears. Named for Chaplain<br />\nEmeritus Chester Wickwire,<br />\nChester's was founded by<br />\ngraduate students anxious to provide an outlet for the frustrations<br />\n<br />\nof Hopkins life.<br />\nChester's was first a coffee<br />\nhouse, where students: went to<br />\nplay and listen to music, read<br />\npoetry, dance, and generally unwind in a relaxed social setting.<br />\nUnder the direction of David<br />\nFishkin, who ran the club through<br />\nthe mid-1970s, Chester's soon<br />\nbecame a showcase for local<br />\nbands and performers. Musicians<br />\nfrom the Baltimore area and the<br />\nHopkins community came to put<br />\non free shows in hopes of gaining support for their acts.<br />\nFishkin<br />\nentered<br />\nsemiretirement in 1985; since then a<br />\nnumber of undergraduates have<br />\nbeen selected as honorary<br />\n\"Chesters\"\u2014people responsible<br />\nfor recruiting and promoting the<br />\nband's who come to Chester's<br />\nPlace.

These five are<br />\nno more than sketches, and are hardly cohesive; perhaps director Thom<br />\nEberhardt didn't take chemistry.<br />\n(Unfortunately, the film glosses over<br />\nthe most intriguing of the five: Kim<br />\nMcCauley (Alice Carter), who has<br />\na baby and is expecting another during spring semester.) Joe Slovak<br />\n(Matthew Modine) is conceited, irreverent, and annoying. He's supposed to be brilliant, but Modine<br />\ncomes off like Dr. Joker,<br />\ntransplanted from his role in \"Full<br />\nMetal Jacket.\" He adores his analretentive lab partner Laurie Rorbach<br />\n(Daphne Zuniga), and is challenged<br />\nby Dr. Rachel Woodruff(Christine<br />\nLahti), who is little more than a<br />\n\"Paper Chase\" clone. Instead of<br />\nstudying, Joe pursues Laurie, who<br />\njogs all the time and doesn't seem to<br />\nstudy much herself. In fact, it is<br />\nbookworm David Schreiner (Todd<br />\nField), who takes speed and rises at<br />\n4:30 to study, who is \"asked to<br />\nleave.\" One gets the feeling that<br />\nnone of these people will ever be<br />\nqualified to be doctors: the students<br />\nwho study the most flunk out. \"St.<br />\nElsewhere\" keeps looking better and<br />\nbetter.<br />\nA DRY WHITE SEASON<br />\nEuzhan Palcy's South African<br />\ndocu-drama may play loosely with<br />\nthe facts, but the result is overpowering. History teacher Ben du Toit<br />\n(Donald Sutherland) lives the ideal<br />\nlife of a white South African,<br />\ndistanced from and largely ignorant<br />\nof his country's racial unrest. It takes<br />\nthe horrible murder of his gardener's<br />\nson (during the 1976 Soweto uprising) to draw him into the atrocities<br />\nof Apartheid, much to the dismay of<br />\nhis family and the South African<br />\nspecial police. Marlon Brando submits a top-flight performance as rotund barrister Sheldon McKenzie, an<br />\nover-the-hill civil rights champion<br />\nwho takes one final case. Ben's life<br />\n<br />\nunravels as he becomes inextricably<br />\nlinked to the cause of freedom, and<br />\nhe lives his final days much like the<br />\nSouth African blacks he has finally<br />\nmade an effort to understand. \"A<br />\nDry White Season\" has a heavy<br />\nmoral message, but Palcy makes that<br />\nclear from the opening moments:<br />\nthere's no deception or disappointment. Besides, the moral is the right<br />\none, and tautly presented.<br />\nTHE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS<br />\nMichelle Pfeiffer is Susie Diamond, the gum-chewing, sultrytoned wonder who breathes life into<br />\nSteve Kloves' directorial debut with<br />\nevery breath she takes. Beau and Jeff<br />\nBridges play Frank and Jack Baker,<br />\nlounge lizards on the ropes until<br />\nSusie stumbles into their life and<br />\ntakes their stale piano act (and the<br />\nfilm) to another plane. Pfeiffer<br />\nstakes her claim as perhaps the most<br />\nbeautiful and sexy film actress in<br />\nhistory. Diamond isn't a role she<br />\nsinks her teeth into\u2014she sort of<br />\nwraps herself around it. The scenes<br />\nof the Boys and Susie together have<br />\nan undeniable chemistry and a<br />\nwonderful feel, which makes Susie's<br />\nexit all the more frustrating. She's<br />\nstrangely absent from the final act,<br />\nand we're left with Frank, stuck in<br />\nsuburbia with the kids; and Jack,<br />\nmoping about his failures as a blues<br />\npianist. Meanwhile, Susie, the<br />\ncatalyst, has gone to sing vegetable<br />\ncommercials. As \"The Fabulous<br />\nBaker Boys\" ends, you may wonder<br />\nwhy Kloves chose to break up such<br />\na successful trio.<br />\n<br />\nAN INNOCENT MAN<br />\nPeter Yates' prison drama is as<br />\npredictable and intelligence-insulting<br />\nas a bad TV movie. Tom Selleck<br />\nplays Jimmie Rainwood, a triumphant airline mechanic sent to prison<br />\nfor a crime he didn't commit. While<br />\nin the big house, he watches a friend<br />\nburn to death and observes the gangrape of a white prisoner by a group<br />\nof black inmates, just for starters.<br />\nHow could Selleck be anything but<br />\ninnocent? He's predictably spineless<br />\nin prison, but when he gets paroled<br />\nafter three years he's still a wimp,<br />\neven with the tutelage of prison<br />\nstrongman Virgil Cane (F. Murray<br />\nAbraham). It would have been nice<br />\nfor Selleck to turn into a sadistic<br />\nkiller when he gets out of jail, but<br />\n<br />\nRichard Cartwright<br />\n<br />\nhe looks as ready for a \"Magnum<br />\nPt.\" reunion as ever. Screenwriter<br />\nand ex-con Larry Brothers offers a<br />\ntaste of gritty prison life, but the<br />\ndrama doesn't hold when the<br />\ncharacters try to speak. The best<br />\nthing about \"An Innocent Man\"<br />\nis that the improvements made in the<br />\nCalifornia and Ohio prisons for the<br />\nfilm were left intact after shooting.<br />\n(Love the new electrified fence!)<br />\nPerhaps the filmmakers should have<br />\nbeen left there as well.<br />\nBLACK RAIN<br />\nRidley Scott's vision of a gleaming Osaka is haunting, but it drops<br />\nlike a lead weight in this overburdened Japan-bashing thriller and star<br />\nvehicle for Michael Douglas.<br />\nDouglas plays the crabby and slightly crooked New York Detective<br />\nNick Conklin who, along with partner Charlie Vincent(Andy Garcia),<br />\nmust escort Mafia wunderkind Sato<br />\n(Yusaku Matsuda) back to Japan<br />\nfrom New York City. But the<br />\nbumbling New Yorkers deliver Sato<br />\nright into the Mafia's hands, and<br />\nthey are forced to stay in Osaka until they find him and clear Conklin's<br />\nname. Garcia shines as Vincent, and<br />\nhis early exit leaves \"Black Rain\"<br />\nwanting. Kate Capshaw, irrelevant<br />\nas the wisecracking geisha girl Joyce<br />\nKingsley, gets the film's hokiest<br />\nlines and silliest scenes.' Black<br />\nRain\" is satisfying entertainment,<br />\neven if it can't stand up to scrutiny.<br />\nBut as it ends, you may feel like<br />\nyou've seen most of this before.,<br />\nperhaps in Scott's other big hit,<br />\n\"Blade Runner.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2014Mark Friedman<br />\n<br />\nCHESTER'S<br />\nfrom 13<br />\nsmoothly, and J.R.

We get a rare opportunity to watch the<br />\nhunted through their own eyes, and the message<br />\nis clear: it ain't fun to be hunted. One could go<br />\non for hours about the metaphors in \"The Bear\";<br />\nthe film makes you do a lot of the work yourself,<br />\nbut it isn't entirely fruitless labor.<br />\nThe anti-hunting message in \"The Bear\" is selfexplanatory. Yet Annaud somehow skips the<br />\nchance to hammer it home. When Kaar at last confronts the hunter who shot him, he merely growls<br />\nand swats at him. Now, if Kaar had mauled him,<br />\nmaybe ripped off his arm, then that would be a<br />\ndeterrent to hunters.

While \"The Bear\" does<br />\ncontain moments of violence, there's no point in<br />\ndisguising the film's appeal to children. The blood<br />\nhere is the brightest and fakest shade of red that<br />\nfilm has seen in some time.<br />\n<br />\nTHEATER, from 12<br />\nflavor. The transition of characters McColl made<br />\nfrom the second to the third scene was<br />\nimpressive\u2014some members of the audience didn't<br />\nrealize he was the same person.<br />\nThe fourth scene in \"California Suite\" is a continuation of the third. It takes place after the Oscars<br />\nceremony, from which Diane returns emptyhanded. McColl and Tesoriero wind through a<br />\nwhirlwind of emoiions, from depression to affection to anger and exasperation. The acting grows<br />\ntruly strong by scene's end, leaving the audience<br />\nwith the same feeling of emptiness that plagues<br />\nDiane.<br />\nThe pains and benefits of vacationing with<br />\nfriends are the focus of the fifth and final scene,<br />\nwhich, like the rest of the play, is filled with sharp<br />\none-liners. These comical barbs, however,<br />\nwouldn't have worked without the sly humor of<br />\nthis last scene's cast. Mort and Beth Hollander<br />\n(Matt Lindsay and Mona Foad) and Gert and Stu<br />\nFranklyn (Kara Stein and Dave Howe) are two<br />\ncouples from Chicago, and their vacation is<br />\nphysical in the extreme, from the point at which<br />\nBeth hurts her foot at tennis to the scene's conclusion, when Stu and Mort end up wrestling on<br />\nthe floor.<br />\nThe audience witnesses more than physical<br />\nblows, however. These actors generate true comedy, making one think at times that Chevy Chase<br />\nis on stage, tripping and falling, as the audience<br />\nsends laughter filtering through the auditorium.<br />\nParticularly memorable was Stein's character, clad<br />\nin fluorescent green, pink, and black, and constantly getting attention with her high-pitched,<br />\nNew Yorker accent.<br />\nDespite these shortcomings, \"The Bear\" has<br />\nits moments. Still, this may be a film more to admire than enjoy. It is by no means a failure: the<br />\nfirst fifteen minutes are thrilling, even if they do<br />\nlook like something from \"The Wonderful World<br />\nof Disney.\" Most of the film has an assuring<br />\nrealism, something all too uncommon in cinema<br />\ntoday.

While humorous<br />\nto most, there are some to whom<br />\nhiccups are no laughing matter.<br />\nWhen hiccups are incessant for<br />\nseveral days, the victim endures<br />\na great deal of stress, depending<br />\non the severity of the case. At the<br />\nrate of ten to twenty hiccups per<br />\nminute, a man has lived, hiccuping for over 65 years. That's<br />\nmore than half a billion hiccups!<br />\nDespite the ubiquity of the hiccup, the rareness of death from<br />\nit has motivated few researchers<br />\nto consider its physiology. The<br />\nones who have studied hiccups<br />\nhave noted the entangled web of<br />\napparently unrelated causes and<br />\nassociated conditions, ranging<br />\nfrom heart attack to a bug in the<br />\near. In addition, the successful<br />\n<br />\ncures for hiccups are equally<br />\ndiverse, and may not always correlate with the postulated cause.<br />\nThe hiccup mechanism is<br />\ncharacterized by an abrupt inspiratory muscle discharge punctuated by an associated audible<br />\nglottal closure. The intensity of<br />\nthe discharge is much greater than<br />\nthat of ordinary breathing, but<br />\nuses a similar motion. The hiccup always occurs in an inspiratory motion, briefly inhibiting any expiration taking<br />\nplace in the respiratory cycle. In<br />\na detailed study of three individuals suffering from hiccups,<br />\nit was also seen that hiccups are<br />\nmuch more likely to occur in the<br />\ninspiratory phase of breathing<br />\nthan the expiratory phase.<br />\nAdditional characteristics of the<br />\nhiccup arising from the study<br />\nwere that the frequency and<br />\n<br />\ned the need to \"carefully design<br />\nand clearly describe an experiment that will answer a particular<br />\nquestion and raise other questions<br />\nupon which further research may<br />\nbe built.\" The experiment must<br />\nbe also feasible with respect to the<br />\navailability of precious resources<br />\nsuch as time, money, personnel<br />\nand equipment.<br />\nAnother important factor in<br />\nsecuring research grants and contracts is establishing a reputation<br />\namongst one's peers by conducting experiments, publishing<br />\nresults and submitting papers.<br />\nDr. Robert Kelly of Chemical<br />\nEngineering described the dilemma that inexperienced junior professors face: \"It's like the<br />\nchicken and egg phenomenonto get support you need previous<br />\nresults. To get previous results<br />\nyou need grants and contracts.\"<br />\nThe more experienced researchers have established lines of<br />\nsupport and must then concentrate their efforts on \"maintaining a level of excellence in<br />\nresearch,\" contrasted Prof.<br />\nKelly.<br />\n\"Research livelihood is based<br />\non bringing in funds; consequently there is a lot of support built<br />\ninto the University structure... Interested senior faculty go out of<br />\ntheir way to help junior faculty<br />\nmembers in learning about the<br />\nprocess, making contacts... but,<br />\nthen it all comes down to how<br />\ntalented and energetic an individual is... the bottom line [for<br />\nresearchers] is the quality of the<br />\nwork they do and how well<br />\nregarded Iby peers] they are as<br />\npublished authorities.\"<br />\nProposals are evaluated<br />\nthrough a system of \"peer<br />\nreview,\" in which an individual<br />\nor panel of experts in a particular<br />\nfield(s) related to the topic or the<br />\nproposal assign each proposal a<br />\n<br />\namplitude of hiccups were not<br />\nrelated, but controlled independently. This is manifested<br />\nin the fact that raising blood levels<br />\nof carbon dioxide either by<br />\nbreathing gaseous carbon dioxide<br />\nor holding the breath decreased<br />\nthe frequency, usually to the point<br />\nof stopping the hiccups, without<br />\naffecting the amplitude in any<br />\nway. When stopped by carbon<br />\ndioxide and removed from the<br />\noriginal stimulus, hiccups do not<br />\nreturn, implying that there is<br />\nsome hiccup feature which<br />\nperpetuates the case.<br />\nWhile hiccuping is a primitive<br />\nreflex action, unlike coughing or<br />\nsneezing it has no obvious<br />\nphysiological function. In some<br />\ncases it prevents passage of food<br />\nfrom the esophagus to the<br />\nstomach, but this is hardly a<br />\nuniversal trait. Other possible<br />\nfunctions remain obscure.<br />\n<br />\nDonna Williamson<br />\nJohn Paul Elrod helps computerize the quest for grants.<br />\n<br />\npriority score ranging from very<br />\nimportant to least important. The<br />\nsponsor or agency then allocates<br />\nthe funds based on the experts'<br />\nfindings.<br />\n\"The peer review system is an<br />\nimpressive one,\" remarked Prof.<br />\nFischman, \"and I believe very<br />\nfair in the way money is awarded. Of course,\" she continued,<br />\n\"the agency has the final say, but<br />\nit tends to stick closely to the<br />\npriority scores as voted by the<br />\nreviewers.\"<br />\nThere is one major source of<br />\nfrustration inherent in the system<br />\nof granting funds which each professor mentioned or alluded to.<br />\nDr. Kelly called it the \"luck of<br />\nthe draw,\" explaining that certain<br />\nfactors are beyond the researchers' control.<br />\nProf. John Ferry from the<br />\nDepartment of Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Sciences commented<br />\nthat his biggest frustration is the<br />\nfact that organizations like the<br />\nNational Science Foundation do<br />\nnot have enough money<br />\nthemselves to be able to supply<br />\nresearchers with the full amount<br />\nthey require to carry on proposed research. Therefore, professors are \"always writing<br />\ngrants and submitting new proposals,\" which detracts from<br />\ntheir actual research and<br />\nacademic pursuits.<br />\nProf. Kelly reflected on the<br />\nresearchers' motivations for<br />\nsoliciting funds, \"The essence of<br />\nwhy you go after all this money<br />\n<br />\nis to provide a proper research<br />\nenvironment that graduate<br />\nstudents can experience.., in<br />\norder to make them significant<br />\npeople in the field they're working in... once they get out on their<br />\nown.\"<br />\nProf. Ferry offered further<br />\nmotivations for conducting basic<br />\nresearch, with which his fellow<br />\nscientists agree wholeheartedly.<br />\n\"We justify our work on two<br />\nlevels.., first it is beneficial to increase our knowledge and<br />\nunderstanding of how nature<br />\nworks, and secondly practical applications will invariably come<br />\n[from such research whether or<br />\nnot such applications were<br />\nforeseen].\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Squid<br />\nWhy do we have earwax?<br />\nEarwax repels bugs and<br />\nkeeps the skin of the ear canal<br />\nand the eardrum from drying<br />\nout.

In a<br />\ndefensive struggle in which<br />\nneither team amassed 200 net<br />\nyards, the Georgetown Hoyas<br />\nstopped the Jays, 20-7, before a<br />\nParents' Weekend crowd of more<br />\nthan 2000.<br />\nThe Jays got off to another<br />\nquick start after forcing the Hoyas<br />\nto punt on four downs on the first<br />\npossession. Hopkins drove the<br />\nball from its own 38-yard line to<br />\nthe Hoya 31-yard line in five<br />\nplays; but on the next play,<br />\nquarterback Jay Simons fumbled<br />\nthe ball and the Hoyas recovered.<br />\nThe Jays stopped Georgetown<br />\non four downs, but Hopkins also<br />\nhad to punt on four downs. On<br />\nthe return, the Hoyas' Matt<br />\nMcLaughlin ran 30 yards to the<br />\nJays' 36. The Hoyas advanced<br />\nthe ball to the six where they settled for a 23-yard field goal by<br />\nTom Timperman.<br />\nThe Jays didn't return to Hoya<br />\nterritory until the second quarter,<br />\nand then got no closer than the<br />\n35-yard line.<br />\nIn the second quarter, the<br />\nHoyas scored twice on defensive<br />\nseries. First, the Jays faced a<br />\nthird-and-eleven from their 32,<br />\nand Simons was intercepted by<br />\nfreshman defensive back Jim<br />\nBolger, who returned the catch<br />\n<br />\nfor a touchdown. The point-after<br />\nput the Hoyas up 10-0.<br />\nLater in the quarter, John<br />\nGuglielmo, who replaced Simons<br />\nat quarterback, fumbled; the ball<br />\npopped straight into the air and<br />\ninto the hands of defensive<br />\nlineman Nabil Al-Sabih, who<br />\noutsprinted all for a 27-yard<br />\ntouchdown. The extra point put<br />\nthe Hoyas up 17-0 with 49<br />\nseconds left in the half.<br />\nThe Jays lone touchdown came<br />\nin the third quarter when, on<br />\nthird and ten, Coach Pfeifer pulled a rabbit out of his hat, calling<br />\nthe hook and ladder play.<br />\nGuglielmo connected with<br />\nreceiver Brandon Rosser, who<br />\nthen lateraled to running back<br />\nErik Mont for a 77-yard<br />\ntouchdown play. John Darre's<br />\nkick moved the Jays within 13.<br />\nDarre also returned punts for the<br />\nJays, and set a Blue Jay record<br />\nwith seven punt returns in one<br />\ngame.<br />\nOn the following series, running back J.J. Williams fumbled<br />\nand the Jays recovered on the<br />\nHoya 18. The momentum was in<br />\nfavor of the Jays only momentarily. Two plays later, Guglielmo<br />\nwas facing a third-and-22 from<br />\nthe 30, and then on fourthand-23, the Jays advanced only<br />\n11 yards.<br />\nAfter that, the Jays never got<br />\ncloser than the Hoya 38-yard line.<br />\n<br />\nAnother Timperman field goal<br />\nput the Hoyas up 20-7 and completed the scoring.<br />\n\"Defense as a whole did a<br />\ngreat job on both sides,\" said<br />\njunior linebacker Kevin Fitzpatrick. \"Their defense came up<br />\nwith 14 points while their offense<br />\nnever scored a TD.\"<br />\nOffensively, Simons and<br />\nGuglielmo went a combined 12 of<br />\n36 for 151 yards, including the<br />\ntouchdown catch of 77 yards. On<br />\nthe ground, the Jays averaged a<br />\nnet gain of 1.0 yards per carry on<br />\n29 carries. The Hoyas averaged<br />\n1.9 yards per carry on 45 carries,<br />\nwhile their attack yielded a 15.1<br />\nyard average per catch.<br />\n\"They're the worst offense<br />\nwe'll see this year,\" said senior<br />\ncaptain Steve Davis. \"We had<br />\nplenty of opportunities to score.<br />\nTraditionally, we're a passing<br />\nteam.

Junior<br />\ngoaltender Dave Bowyer was<br />\noutstanding in the net as he made<br />\n18 saves, but he was quick to<br />\ncredit his defense for much of his<br />\nsuccess. \"Our guys really put the<br />\nclamp on their offense. It was a<br />\nchallenge for me to keep my concentration while facing so few<br />\nshots.\"<br />\nThe offense, thought to be the<br />\nquestion mark for the team, provided the needed punch with a<br />\nbalanced scoring attack in which<br />\nfive different Blue Jays scored.<br />\nThe first period began as a<br />\nstalemate as both teams held<br />\nthe other in check for the first 6<br />\nminutes. The Jays drew first<br />\nblood, however, as freshman<br />\nJason Sprague sent a beautiful<br />\npass across the middle to senior<br />\nJack Calkins, who was waiting on<br />\nthe left post to drive it home. One<br />\nminute later, Sprague completed<br />\na spin move to open up the ice<br />\nand again found Calkins on the<br />\npost where Jack was able to collect his second goal of the night.<br />\nThe Jays maintained this torrid<br />\n<br />\nfirst period pace when playmaker<br />\nSprague assisted for the third time<br />\nby hitting Pierre DeMatos high in<br />\nthe slot. DeMatos took one step<br />\ntoward the goal before rifling a<br />\nshot past the left shoulder of<br />\nSalisbury's goalie to give<br />\nHopkins a 3-0 advantage.<br />\nAfter letting up a goal at the tail<br />\nend of the first period, the<br />\nstickmen took the ice in the second period looking to leave their<br />\nopponents in the dust. Right from<br />\nthe opening whistle the Jays were<br />\nall over them, and the hustle paid<br />\noff. Jon Lowthert took a pass<br />\nfrom senior captain Mike<br />\nHolmes deep in his own zone.<br />\nLowthert skated the puck by two<br />\ndefenders before making a blind<br />\nbehind the back pass to Norm<br />\nShephard, who was wide open in<br />\nfront of the net. Shephard easily<br />\nbeat the Salisbury goalie to extend<br />\nthe Jays' lead to 4-1.<br />\nAfter a 7-minute lull in the action, Phil Schied made a superb<br />\ndefensive play when he successfully thwarted the efforts of<br />\ntwo rushing Salisbury forwards.<br />\nSeeing the five-on-three advantage he had created, Schied found<br />\nKirk Perry all alone beyond the<br />\nSalisbury defense. Perry approached the goal on a difficult<br />\nangle from the right side, but was<br />\nstill able to slip the puck between<br />\nthe legs of the opposing<br />\ngoaltender.<br />\nA minute and a half later<br />\n<br />\nHolmes found Dave Boxenbaum<br />\nat center ice, where Boxenbaum<br />\nwas able to beat two deferders in<br />\norder to set up a snap shot from<br />\n15 feet out. Salisbury's goalie appeared to make the save, but<br />\njuggled the puck into his own net<br />\nto make the score 6-1.<br />\nSalisbury responded to this last<br />\ngoal 50 seconds later, but were<br />\nunable to create any momentum<br />\nfor themselves.<br />\nThe third period provided no<br />\nscoring, due largely to fine<br />\ngoaltending. Bowyer frustrated<br />\nthe Salisbury offense by making<br />\nrepeated saves. \"He's unbeatable<br />\non that glove side,\" commented<br />\nHolmes.<br />\nThe season-opening victory<br />\nwas very satisfying for the team,<br />\nbut they realize that the Salisbury<br />\nsquad was not representative of<br />\nthe type of competition they will<br />\nface this season. \"It was a great<br />\nwin,\" offered Coach Steve<br />\nWirth, \"but we're going to have<br />\nto improve even more in order to<br />\nbe competitive in league play.<br />\nAgainst teams like Georgetown<br />\nwe have to stay intense for the<br />\nwhole game and not just for two<br />\nperiods like today.\"<br />\nNext up for the hockey team is<br />\nrival Western Maryland on Saturday at 7:15 p.m. at Northwest Ice<br />\nRink, on Falls Road and Kelly<br />\nStreet in Mount Washington<br />\nVillage.<br />\n<br />\nNoon Mid-week non-denominational service in the Little Theatre, Levering Hall.<br />\nSponsored by ihe Office of the Chaplain.<br />\n8 p.m. Cultural Fest '89 moves along with the CSA nightly movie, \"Split Spirit\"<br />\nin Remsen 101,<br />\n<br />\nWednesday, November 1<br />\nNoon The Wednesday Noon Series presents \"Dancers of the Third Age: A Senior<br />\nAdults Mqdern Dance Group\" in the Garrett Room of the MSE Library.<br />\n5 p.m. With Cultural Fest '89 in high gear, the BSU presents a workshop by<br />\nthe Olu African Dance Troupe in the Arellano Theatre.<br />\n7 p.m. After dancing, come watch the NSA film, \"Tampopo\" in the AMR I<br />\nTV room.<br />\n7:30 p.m. The \"Women on the Screen: Film & Feminism Series\" presents<br />\nMarianne & Juliane in the Main Auditorium of the Preclinical Teaching Building<br />\nat the Medical School.<br />\n8 p.m. The CSA show their nightly movie, \"Black Skin and White Tooth\" in<br />\nNEB room B-21.<br />\n<br />\nThursday, November 2<br />\n4 p.m. Valerie Thornhill will be giving a lecture on \"The Unique Vision of the<br />\nEnglish Coantry House and Garden\" in the Garrett Room of the MSE Library.<br />\n6 p.m. Co ne view a slideshow of the Soviet Union and Northern Italy by Dr.<br />\nAranow in NEB 123.<br />\n6 p.m. Watch an NSA karate demonstration in the athletic center.<br />\n8 p.m. Lauro Cavazos, U.S. Secretary of Education, will be lecturing on The<br />\nRole ofHigher Education in Restructuring Elementary and Secondary Education<br />\nin the first MSE symposium of the year at Shriver Hall<br />\n8 p.m. Listen to a CIG lecture, \"Social and Cultural Aspects of Cricket\" by Dr.<br />\nMaurice Saint-Pierre in Ma.ryland 104.<br />\n8 p.m. The CSA present their final movie of the week,\"The Tan Shui\" in Remsen<br />\n101<br />\n9 p.m. Ole presents the final event of Cultural Fest '89, the film \"Erendira,'<br />\nin Maryland 110.<br />\n<br />\n\f20/OCTOBER 27, 1989<br />\n<br />\nClimbing Behind<br />\n<br />\n'THE AMERICAN DREAM\"<br />\n<br />\nCrew races well<br />\nMen's X-C wins at Head<br />\nof the Charles<br />\n<br />\nWhat does it offer and what<br />\ndoes it cost?<br />\n<br />\nby 1ngebord Schlate<br />\nand Kelly Kieffer<br />\n<br />\nAre there other offers<br />\nout there?<br />\nCome and consider this topic<br />\nat an Open Talk for<br />\nthe Hopkins community.<br />\nFriday, October 27th<br />\n7:15 p.m.<br />\nGarrett Room, MSE Library<br />\nAmazing Refreshments to Follow<br />\nSponsored by the<br />\nHopkins Christian Fellowship<br />\n<br />\nCltstklOUPSand<br />\nPS!<br />\nFa<br />\n<br />\nWITH<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\ntie<br />\nBullets<br />\n\"MUG NIGHT\"<br />\nBullets vs. Cleveland<br />\nFriday, November 10<br />\n8 PM, Baltimore Arena<br />\nTickets: $10<br />\nFor tickets see Susanna in the Student Activities Office by Friday, Nov 3<br />\nSTUDENT PUGWASH & THE WOMEN'S CENTER<br />\nPRESENT<br />\n<br />\nMen's cross-country destroyed Washington College at Homewood last<br />\nBill Berger<br />\nSaturday.<br />\nhad no competition throughout<br />\nby Coleen Furey<br />\nthe five-mile race.

It was an<br />\noff-season exhibition without any<br />\neffect on rankings or records.<br />\n\"The worst thing anyone could<br />\ndo now is push the panic button,\"<br />\nsaid head coach Don Zimmerman. \"If anyone should push it,<br />\nit's me, and I'm certainly not.\"<br />\nFor the first 58 minutes of<br />\nregulation, the Blue Jays<br />\ndisplayed a typical, successful<br />\nperformance: the Jays started off<br />\nvery strong, held a slim lead at<br />\nhalftime, dominated the third<br />\nquarter, and were in control in the<br />\nfourth. With a 10-6 Hopkins lead<br />\nand less than two minutes remaining, all looked well. So Zimmerman relaxed and substituted<br />\nextensively.<br />\nBrian Kroneberger cut the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins margin to three goals<br />\nwith one minute, 52 seconds to<br />\nplay. Still, all was well. Then<br />\ncame the two-pointer. For the<br />\nClassic, Choice Visa introduced<br />\na two-point goal, awarded on any<br />\ngoal scored on a shot taken between the midfield line and a<br />\nsemicircular arc extending 17<br />\nyards from the center of the<br />\ncrease. The two-point goal will<br />\nnot be used in games this spring.<br />\nHopkins had benefitted first<br />\nfrom the innovation, as Greg Kelly beat Loyola goalie Charlie<br />\nToomey from 17 feet with 22<br />\nseconds remaining in the third<br />\nperiod to increase a 7-3 Jay lead<br />\nto 9-3. At that point, the twopoint idea seemed novel, but<br />\nrather insignificant.<br />\nKroneberger's two-pointer<br />\nwith 67 seconds remaining<br />\nchanged that thinking. Suddenly<br />\nthe Greyhounds trailed by only<br />\none goal. Zimmerman returned to<br />\nhis starting troops, but it Was too<br />\nlate. Momentum was lost, and the<br />\n'Hounds were hungry.<br />\nLoyola's Paul Cantabene won<br />\n<br />\nthe ensuing faceoff, raced down<br />\nthe field, and fired past allAmerican goaltender Quint<br />\nKessenich to tie the game. One<br />\nminute, 47 seconds into overtime<br />\nKroneberger ended it.<br />\n\"I've got to give Loyola a lot<br />\nof credit,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\n\"They hung tough. Not to take<br />\nanything away from them, but I<br />\ntake full responsibility for the<br />\nloss. I learned something about<br />\nthe two-pointer today. I was<br />\ncoaching without thinking about<br />\nit, and I'm at fault for that.\u2014<br />\nLoyola coach Dave Cottle was<br />\nreserved in his enthusiasm about<br />\ndefeating last year's national<br />\nrunner-up. \"It was a good<br />\ngame,\" said the coach, \"but all<br />\nit means is that we played tough<br />\nin a fall game.\"<br />\nSunday, in the tournament's<br />\nconsolation game, the Jays released their frustration on MarylandBaltimore County, earning a 20-6<br />\nconquest.

In tennis, Phi Psi captured<br />\nthe crown, with FIJI second. In<br />\nthe roadrace, the dorms finished<br />\nas follows: Vincent-Willard,<br />\nWood, Jennings, and Jennings.<br />\n(Are you satisfied now, Cathy?)<br />\nIn the event of future confusion,<br />\nup to the minute BIA scores and<br />\nstats may now be accessed 24<br />\nhours a day by calling 976-VINY<br />\n($2.23 for the first minute, $0.95<br />\nfor each additional minute).<br />\nFootball playoffs wrap up next<br />\nweek; there will be no rescheduling. The top seeds are as follows:<br />\nin the independents, the Snapper<br />\nHeads; in the fraternities, WaWa;<br />\nin the dorms, Building A. Watch<br />\nout for the Baboon Heads and<br />\nLazear as dark cows, though.<br />\nOn the BIA horizon looms the<br />\nsoccer tournament and the bike<br />\nrace. Soccer pairings should be<br />\nposted by now, so check at the<br />\ncage (call Jen Chun, 243-4232).<br />\nRed tape is causing delays in the<br />\nscheduling of the bike race, but<br />\nMayor Schmoke is on top of it;<br />\n<br />\nwatch for posters. In midNovember watch for volleyball.<br />\nNow for some totals in the<br />\nstandings. In the fraternity division, DU holds a comfortable<br />\nlead over Sig Ep, followed by<br />\nWaWa. The dorm division<br />\nfeatures Wilson and Jennings in<br />\na dead heat, followed by VincentWillard. The mighty Woodrow<br />\nholds a slim lead over the Snapper Heads, with the KSA holding<br />\nthird. (Note: these scores do not<br />\ninclude any results from football.)<br />\nNow it's time for the player of<br />\nthe week. Betsy Cox did not win,<br />\nand Ed Rhew did not throw up,<br />\nbut Eric Wasserman did it all for<br />\nWaWa this past week in football.<br />\nHe threw for one TD, caught<br />\nanother, and had three interceptions.

The test<br />\nfound the range in violation of<br />\nlead dust safety levels, and the<br />\nstate of Maryland condemned and<br />\nsealed the rifle range and fined<br />\nthe Athletic Department $5000.<br />\nThe loss of the range severely<br />\nreduced the amount of practice<br />\nbefore the season's first three<br />\nmatches, and the lack of practice<br />\nshowed itself in the inconsistent<br />\nscores of the teams' top shooters.<br />\nHowever, the team as a whole did<br />\nremarkably well in the first match<br />\nat King's College in Pennsylvania.

For<br />\nexample, the nine-page story on<br />\nthe Five-Year Plan in the<br />\nFebruary '89 issue presented<br />\ncoverage of this controversial<br />\nplan and its possible impact on the<br />\nUniversity in more detail than did<br />\nthe Washington Post or the<br />\nBaltimore Sun. The source also<br />\nbelieved that the article was too<br />\ncandid about the problems facing<br />\nthe School of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThe source did not believe any<br />\nspecific magazine story was the<br />\nreason for Sea's departure.<br />\nHancock said she thought Sea<br />\nwas \"operating like a person on<br />\na city magazine.\" She added,<br />\n\"He was extremely competent,<br />\nbut he had a perspective that was<br />\nnot academic-oriented.\" Hancock said that the magazine lacked coverage of classes, students,<br />\nand \"the things that will be there<br />\nlong after the disputes [over<br /><br />\npolicies].\" Her view was that the<br />\nmagazine narrowed its focus to<br />\npolicies which neither alumni nor<br />\nUniversity officials found acceptable. Hancock saw this narrowed focus as an acute problem<br />\nsince \"the magazine is the<br />\nUniversity's external voice.\"<br />\nAssociate Editor Julia Ridgely<br />\nadded that the magazine needed<br />\nto cover a broader range of campus events and life at Hopkins in<br />\ngeneral because only about half<br />\nof the magazine's readers live in<br />\nthe Baltimore area. The remainder are from out of state, and<br />\nabout 5,000 readers live<br />\noverseas; therefore, Ridgely explained, the magazine should express \"what it would be like to<br />\ngo to Hopkins\" and give \"the<br />\nfeel of the University.\"<br />\nWith Hancock back as editor,<br />\nJones felt that there would be no<br />\nradical change in the magazine's<br />\noperation. The December issue is<br />\n\"on schedule.\" Ridgely added,<br />\n\"It's not like administration decisions which can be put on hold;<br />\nin a publication, the show must<br />\ngo on.\" Hancock concurred and<br />\nexplained, \"Alan left everything<br />\nin very good shape.\" She added,<br />\n\"I'm just carrying on where Alan<br />\nleft off.\"<br />\nAccording to Ridgely, \"We're<br />\nnot in that much more turmoil<br />\nthan we usually are [right around<br />\npress time]; I think the [story on<br />\nthe Californian] earthquake caused more problems.\"<br />\nSenior Science Writer Melissa<br />\nHendricks said that \"it's kind of<br />\ndifficult being in the middle of a<br />\nfeature story [under the guidance<br />\nof one editor] and having to shift<br />\ngears and switch the focus [of the<br />\nstory] a little bit [under the<br />\nguidance of another editor.'\"<br />\nHowever, according to Ridgely,<br />\n\"Any two editors are going to<br />\nhave different approaches to<br />\ncovering stories.\"<br />\nThe University source explained that there has always been a<br />\npolicy emphasizing editorial<br />\nfreedom at the magazine.

Free hot chocolate was<br />\nslurped, tapes awarded to the first<br /><br />\ngroup to \"bitch about the<br />\nmusic,\" and while Phi Psi 500<br />\ntrainee John McGready noted that<br />\nthe planning was \"a little<br />\nstressful,\" the stress was released quickly as a trashcan full of<br />\nleftover water balloons exploded<br />\nin an all-out water war.

My hard<br />\nwork and dedication combined<br />\nwith the help of the HOP and<br />\nSAC (student activities organizations on which I will serve) will<br />\nmake our freshman year full of<br />\nexciting, invigorating, and enjoyable events.

To me, coming from California, an important<br />\nfacet of the overall experience is<br />\nthe meeting and working with<br />\npeople of unique upbringings so<br />\nas to develop a well-rounded set<br />\nof values of my own.

The two<br />\nstrangers stared at him, making<br />\nthe man extremely uncomfortable., until finally one of the two<br />\nstrangers leaned over to the other<br />\nand whispered something to him,<br />\npointing at the man. The two<br />\nstrangers laughed, and the second<br />\nstranger then<br />\nwhispered<br />\nsomething to the first. The<br />\nstrangers laughed again.<br />\nNeedless to say, the man was<br />\nsomewhat unsettled by the whole<br />\nmatter, and in fact as the whispering picked up, his temper rose.<br />\nFinally, infuriated, he tapped the<br />\nshoulder of the old woman seated<br />\nnext to him, indicated the two<br />\nstrangers, and pretended to<br />\nwhisper in her ear. Obviously the<br />\nold woman had no idea what he<br />\nwas doing, and as such looked at<br />\nhim curiously. The two strangers,<br />\nhowever, believed that the old<br />\nwoman's expression was a<br />\nresponse to something the man<br />\ndid.<br />\nWhen the man got off the bus,<br />\nthe two strangers got off with him<br />\nand demanded to know what he<br />\nhad told the old woman. The man<br />\ntried to explain to them that he<br />\nhad said nothing, but the two<br />\ndidn't believe him.<br />\nI don't remember the rest of the<br />\njoke, but I remember thinking of<br />\nthe joke in third grade when I was<br />\ntrying to get back at Mike Bunk<br />\nand Rob VanBuskirk.<br />\nI was always a painfully honest<br />\nchild. I had no secrets. I told<br />\neverybody everything. That's<br />\nprobably why, for much of my<br />\ngrade school career, I was known<br />\nas \"Mouth.\"<br />\nIt's not that I liked telling on<br />\npeople, or spreading gossip<br />\n(though certainly now I enjoy<br />\nthose things), it's just that I<br />\ncouldn't figure out why anybody<br />\nwould keep anything from<br />\nanybody else. That and the fact<br />\nthat I was incredibly curious<br />\nabout everything (though I was<br />\ntold that I was too old to be<br /><br />\nMaking us all look good<br />\nWhen U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos speaks<br />\nnext Thursday at Shriver Hall, he will lead one of the most<br />\nimpressive batteries of speakers ever to gather for the MSE<br />\nSymposium. This current series is striking not merely for<br />\nquality speakers\u2014some of America's leading thinkers\u2014<br />\nbut for the unique combination of perspectives they represent. It's a combination particularly well-suited to address<br />\nthe future of higher education in the United States. But<br />\nthese speakers, to be sure, were not lured to Hopkins by<br />\nthe elegance of its campus. Their presence is the product<br />\nof a full year's work by the Symposium co-chairs, Jeffrey Blitz and Andrea Kaufman.<br />\nBlitz and Kaufman began preparing this year's program<br />\nimmediately upon their selection last fall. The two had to<br />\narticulate a unifying Symposium theme\u2014this without any<br />\ncommitments from potential speakers\u2014and then construct<br />\nthe series of lectures from there. It was hardly an enviable<br />\ntask<br />\nThe Symposium co-chairs not only gave up their summers and intersessions, but gave, too, fifteen hours of their<br />\ntime every week throughout the academic year. Blitz and<br />\nKaufman acted as the Symposium's full-time administrative<br />\nand secretarial staff. They established an Advisory Board<br />\nof Professors and Administrators, sent hundreds of letters,<br />\nmade an equal number of phone calls and, as Kaufman<br />\nobserved, had \"to account for everything that may happen, and everything that's not going to happen.\"<br />\nFrustrating cases in point were the death of a contracted<br />\nSymposium speaker\u2014A. Bartlett Giamatti\u2014and the failure<br />\nof a major grant proposal, despite a month of preparation.<br />\nSimultaneously, all of this had to be coordinated with<br />\nthe School of Arts and Sciences and the University's<br />\nDevelopment Office, so that none of the Symposium's fundraising would conflict with previous capital campaigns.<br />\nThe co-chairs were also faced with responsibility for arranging itineraries and accomodations for the speakers,<br />\nas well as coordinating dinners, choosing appropriate dinner guests, sending dinner invitations, picking up the<br />\nspeakers from their various airports and train stations,<br />\ncoordinating tours, arranging for electricians and<br />\ncarpenters to prepare Shriver Hall, reserving rooms at the<br />\noverbooked Homewood campus\u2014all the while aware that<br />\nthey were representing the Johns Hopkins University and<br />\neverything that that entails.<br />\nUltimately, Blitz and Kaufman were highly visible<br />\nrepresentatives of Johns Hopkins undergraduate education.<br /><br />\nby Christopher T. McColl<br /><br />\ncurious\u2014I was nosy instead).<br />\nMore than once I was knocked by<br />\nmy father and mother for wanting<br />\nto know how old one of their<br />\nfriends was, after that friend had<br />\nasked the same information of<br />\nme.<br />\nAnyway, my friends knew I<br />\ntalked. So they stopped telling me<br />\nthings. It didn't bother me at first,<br />\nmostly because I didn't know it<br />\nwas going on. I talked about<br />\nmyself for as long as my information held out (this was around<br />\nthe time that I was thought of as<br />\nconceited). But how much does<br />\na third-grader have to say about<br />\nhimself'? So, I tried to get in good<br />\nwith my friends again, to find out<br />\nwhat was up with them.<br />\nI was at a disadvantage, and my<br />\nfriends knew it. Mike Bunk and<br />\nRob VanBuskirk in particular. I'd<br />\ngo to the playground with them<br />\nevery day, and every day they'd<br />\nwalk two steps away from me and<br />\nstart whispering.<br />\n\"What're you guys talking<br />\nabout?\"<br />\n\"Nothing. (psst-pssst. Pssspsss-psst).\"<br />\n\"C'mon, you guys. What're<br />\nyou saying?\"<br />\n\"Nothing, Mouth. Ha-ha (psst)<br />\nHa-ha.\"<br />\n'I'll tell!'\"<br />\nWhich in itself was amusing.<br />\nwas going to tell . . . what? That<br />\nwas my whole problem: my<br />\nfriends had stuff to tell and I<br />\ndidn't. I spent hours in introversion and distraction trying to<br />\nfigure out what it was was my<br />\nfriends had been whispering<br />\nabout (it was around this time that<br />\nmy friends started saying that I<br />\nwas acting quiet and weird). In<br />\nmy daze, I often bungled everyday activities, such as brushing<br />\nmy hair or answering the phone.<br />\n\"Chris, why didn't you tell me<br />\nMrs. So-and-So called?\"<br />\n\"I'm sorry, Mom, I forgot.<br />\nRob and Mike were telling secrets<br />\naround me and I got really mad.\"<br />\n\"Well, it was probably things<br />\nyou don't need to know, then.<br />\nBesides, what does that have to<br />\ndo with you not giving me Mrs.<br />\nSo-and-So's message?\"<br /><br />\nWell, I was thinking, and I just<br />\nforgot. You forget stuff too, you<br />\nknow, like when you forgot the<br />\npunchline to that joke about the<br />\nguy on the bus\u2014\"<br />\n\"That's not important. There<br />\nare things that are important\u2014<br />\nthings I need to know. Don't do<br />\nthat again. Now go fix your<br />\nhair.\"<br />\nSo not only was I not supposed to tell everybody<br />\neverything (because I'd run out<br />\nof stuff to say), and not only was<br />\nit not necessary for everybody to<br />\ntell me everything (so Rob. and<br />\nMike could tell secrets around<br />\nme), but I was expected to know<br />\nwhat information was vital and<br />\nwhat was not.<br />\nOf course, there are those instances when it is obvious what<br />\nshould be concealed, such as<br />\nwhen your best friend calls in sick<br />\nto work (at the same bookstore<br />\nwhere you work), and you get<br />\ncalled in to sub on a Saturday<br />\nmorning, and as you go out to<br />\nyour bike you see him coming out<br />\nof your other friend's house two<br />\ndoors down getting into his '57<br />\nChevy Bel-Air with some bleached blonde. In this case, you<br />\nwithhold the information from<br />\nyour boss, though you might take<br />\nit up later with your friend.<br />\nThis is, of course, a lie.

On behalf of Hopkins undergraduates, the<br />\nNews-Letter would like to extend thanks to Blitz and Kaufman for a job well done.<br /><br />\nInsulting fees<br />\nThe proposal by some members of Student Council to<br />\nlevy an activities fee on Hopkins students is an insult. As<br />\ntuition rises past the $14,000 mark, are we now expected<br />\nto pay additional money for programs that should be included in the whopping sum we already shell out each fall<br />\nand spring?<br />\nSome may think, reasonably, that the additional fee is<br />\ninconsiderable in light of the thousands of dollars spent<br />\nduring an academic year. But it is the governing principle<br />\nbehind the fee that matters. Hopkins' tuition has increased by an average of eight percent annually in recent years,<br />\nwhile class sizes have increased, course offerings have<br />\nshrunken and inadequate facilities have remained just that.<br />\nThis ironic \"pay more and get less\" situation is not our<br />\nresponsibility. Yet we are the ones who suffer for it, and<br />\nwho are expected to solve it by surrendering increasingly<br />\nmore money to the school.<br />\nThe ostensible reason for proposing the fee is to increase<br />\nsocial programming\u2014a laudable cause. Unfortunately,<br />\nmany view the fee as a means to generate funds for a student union and other grandiose projects\u2014projects which,<br />\nalthough needed, are the University's responsibity to<br />\nsupply.<br />\nIn examining proposed plans for a new union funded<br />\nby a fee, there are several problems. First, 2700 students<br />\nweighing in at $25 each would yield $135,000 a year, hardly enough for both programming and construction. Second,<br />\nbuilding an adequate facility would take years, and the<br />\nmoney spent by current students will most likely not benefit<br />\nthem directly, but rather, students of a distant, more<br />\ncrowded Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nWe don't deny the need for more social programming,<br />\nnor the desire for a firm Hopkins community. We do deny<br />\nthe possible imposition of yet more fees, no matter how<br />\nsmall, which exist solely to relieve the University of its<br />\nresponsibility to its students.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nTolerantly understanding...<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nGreater than any fear that I<br />\nmight have about the dangers of<br />\nintolerance on our campus are the<br />\nfears that I have about the dangers<br />\nof ignorance. This ignorance is<br />\nperpetuated by the dishonesty that<br />\nI see conducted in our public<br />\ndiscourse, particularly in the last<br />\ntwo issues of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity News-Letter.<br />\nA discussion of two major<br />\nissues, drug abuse and intolerance, was begun by a letter<br />\nwriter who did not have anything<br />\noriginal to say about the first issue<br />\nbut in the nature of the presentation of his/her argument, said a<br />\nlot about the second issue. The<br />\napologetics of the accompanying<br />\neditorial did little to clarify either<br />\nthe nature of drug abuse or intolerance at Hopkins but further<br />\nclouded the air with references to<br />\nprevious incidences of abuse by<br />\nmembers of fraternities.<br />\nThe following week's letters on<br />\nthe above subjects were no less<br />\nrevealing. Anyone unfamiliar<br />\nwith the nature of the social<br />\nculture of the United States would<br />\nbelieve, after reading last week's<br />\nletters on our Greek organizations, that the sytem of PTA's in<br />\nAmerican high schools is an<br />\nanalogous institution; both have<br />\ncharitable fund-raisers, members<br />\nof both are upstanding members<br />\nof the community and both are<br />\nvery touchy when criticized.<br />\nIt seems that the original shot<br />\nin this volley of words was fired<br />\nby an individual who wished to<br />\ncreate a discussion without any of<br />\nthe risks inherent in taking a<br />\nstand. This in my mind, was a<br />\nblind submission to the intolerance that he/she was trying<br />\nto escape. By speaking from<br />\nanonymity the author expressed<br />\nan unwillingness to defend the<br />\nveracity of his/her words that<br />\nundermines the validity of his/her<br />\nargument. In that the author's<br /><br />\nclaims are unsubstantiated and<br />\nunwitnessed, even by the author<br />\nhim/herself, they are in essence,<br />\nuntrue.<br />\nThe News-Letter advanced the<br />\npremises that fraternities are<br />\nresponsible for the actions of its<br />\nindividual members and that<br />\nsome of their members are guilty of crimes of intolerance. In the<br />\nlanguage of the editorial and the<br />\nact of hiding the identity of the<br />\nauthor of the accompanying letter, the News-Letter identifies the<br />\nGreek system at Hopkins, with all<br />\nits strengths and weaknesses, as<br />\nthe locus of an immense,<br />\nthreatening force that can act with<br />\nimpunity\u2014an assertion that is<br />\nfalse.<br />\nFinally, the representatives of<br />\nfraternities and sororities, in letters of varying degrees of honesty, described the nature of their<br />\norganizations. Even as communities within a community,<br />\nGreek organizations are not exempt from the rules of the community as a whole. When<br />\nmembers of the Greek system insult, offend, or break the laws of<br />\nthe greater community, an individual or his/her chapter is<br />\npunished. To claim that all<br />\nmembers of fraternities and<br />\nsororities are exemplary in their<br />\nbehavior, is false.<br />\nIt is incumbent on us, as individuals in society, to make<br />\nresponsible decisions about what<br />\nwe do and what we say. The<br />\ndiscussion of issues such as drug<br />\nabuse, intolerance and the<br />\nlegitimacy of the Greek system<br />\nwould be better served if its participants refrained from making<br />\nungrounded remarks, unfounded<br />\nexaggerations, and untrue assertions.

As I well remember<br />\nfrom two-and-a-bit years ago, for<br />\nforeigners the prospect of traveling several thousand miles only<br />\nto be faced with the prospect of<br />\nhaving to look for an apartment<br />\non arrival is a daunting one. This<br />\nis a fear the Housing Office happily plays on by downplaying the<br />\ncost of its own housing, and making no mention whatsoever of the<br />\nrelative ease of finding private accommodation in Baltimore.

Take this summer<br />\nin north central New Mexico, for<br />\nexample. I was camped up in the<br />\nSangre de Cristo mountains near<br />\nthe Colorado border for three<br />\nweeks. Nearby is a construction<br />\nproject to rebuild a 70-year-old<br />\nearthen dam that has begun to<br />\nleak excessively. As is the case<br />\nin any such construction project,<br />\nthere is a need for numerous<br />\nheavy equipment operators and<br />\nother blue-collar types. The labor<br />\npool of the nearby towns of<br />\nCostilla and Questa are not large<br />\nenough to fill the demand, so<br />\nworkers from surrounding areas<br />\n(as far as California) migrate into the Costilla Valley for these<br />\nfairly well-paying jobs. Most rent<br />\nsome form of housing near the<br />\ntown of Costilla, but the individual of interest, the topic of<br />\ntoday's column, lives in his 1982<br />\nDodge van. It's actually quite efficient; he has a nice bed in the<br />\nback so he can pull off the road<br />\nanywhere and get a good sleep.<br />\nHe only need drive the 20 miles<br />\ninto Costilla every two or three<br />\ndays when supplies need<br />\nreplenishing, rather than every<br />\nday like the rest of the workers.<br />\nMy camp spot was attractive and<br />\nclose to the dam, so he often<br />\nparked his van there to sleep.<br />\nSince we were both alone out<br />\nthere we naturally engaged in<br />\nsome conversations.<br />\nThis guy never did tell me his<br />\nname; I'll just refer to him as<br />\nHolmes. Holmes is in his late<br />\n20's. I guess one could call him<br />\na drifter. He travels around the<br />\nWest from construction job to<br />\nconstruction job. Once he builds<br />\nup some cash, he quits his job and<br />\ntravels around doing what he enjoys, mostly hunting. He then<br />\nfinds a new job when his cash<br />\nruns out.

Lots of people around<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nHolmes asks, \"Have you ever<br />\ndone any fishing up here?\"<br />\n\"No, I've never been into<br />\nfishing too much. Plus, I want to<br />\nget my geology work done and<br />\nget out of here.\"<br />\n\"A couple weeks ago me and<br />\nanother guy went hand fishing.<br />\nEver gone hand fishing?\"<br />\n\"No. You mean you can just<br />\ngrab the fish out of the water?\"<br />\n\"Sure. They hide under the<br />\nstream banks. Just reach under<br />\nand you're sure to find a fish.

Total bill:<br />\n$32.00, $36.00 with tip. This is<br />\nhow long it took us to be seated:<br />\ntwo minutes.(The couple behind<br />\nus in line: 40 minutes.)<br />\nThe place seemed less eccentric than we'd expected; it seemed like a place we could bring our<br />\nparents. But then, maybe our<br />\nparents are just tremendously<br />\ncool. The walls were pale rose,<br />\nand the artwork was pastel landscapes. The waitresses wore matching black tank tops to confuse<br />\nus, and tables came with brown<br />\npaper tablecloths, and a mugful<br />\nof crayons to draw with. Diner<br />\nNumber One said when she saw<br />\nthe crayons, \"Oooh\u2014I bet this<br />\nmeans a long wait for the food,\"<br />\nand of course she was right, but<br />\nthen she's from New York where<br />\nI hear all the restaurants have<br />\ncrayons at their tables.<br />\nThings like long waits for food<br />\ncan be forgiven when you are<br />\ngrateful to get a table at all, let<br />\nalone in two minutes. There was<br />\nlots to watch: the artwork mentioned above improved with gazing, the scrawlings taking shape<br />\nunder our various sets of fingers,<br />\nthe waiters and waitresses walking by, the people next to us and<br />\ntheir food, which certainly looked good.<br />\nDiner Number Two, an<br />\nengineer, had drawn a series of<br />\nsine curves and round pigs by the<br />\ntime the nachos and the chili arrived. The nachos seemed more<br />\nlike an open tortilla with beans,<br />\ncheese and vegetables (and sour<br />\ncream on the side) than the usual<br />\nchips. They were good,they were<br />\nmore than good, they were the<br />\nbest thing of the evening as it<br />\nturned out. If! went there again<br /><br />\nI might get them as my dinner.<br />\nThe vegetarian chili, we<br />\nagreed, needed more salt, and we<br />\nadded some to improve it, but not<br />\nnearly to the level of the nachos.<br />\nGiven Diner Number One's<br />\nhistory of MSG consumption it's<br />\nunderstandable, this reaching for<br />\nthe salt shaker, stirring some in<br />\nand tasting it with a quizzical look<br />\non her face, then adding more and<br />\ntasting it again, and saying to<br />\nDiner Number Two, \"It makes<br />\na difference\u2014see, taste it.\"<br />\nDiner Number Two tasted it,<br />\nand he agreed, but then we all<br />\nagreed that it just wasn't that<br />\ngood anyway, no matter how<br />\nmuch salt we threw in it, and so<br />\nwhen the waitress brought us the<br />\nmain course the chili bowl had<br />\nfour spoonfuls left in it at least.<br />\nWhen the dinners came we<br />\ndecided that the best food of the<br />\nmain course was mine, the<br />\nvegetarian chimichanga, a fried<br />\ntortilla with beans and cheese and<br />\nguacamole (not as much as I'd<br />\nhave liked) and sour cream.<br />\nDiner Number One added salt<br />\nto her enchilada and bean combination to no avail, and then said<br />\nthat her dinner was the worst of<br />\nall; she said, after lifting the plate<br />\nin a vain effort to pawn it off on<br />\none of us, \"Look ,this is just a<br />\nlump of beans and cheese.\" I<br />\ntasted the bean enchilada and she<br />\nwas right, it tasted like beans and<br />\na bit of cheese and some more<br />\nbeans, with some salt on the top.<br />\nOur waitress asked us if we<br />\nwanted it wrapped to go and we<br />\nsaid no thanks, and she left with<br />\nthe plates and came back with the<br />\ncheck and walked away. When<br />\nwe caught her again we ordered<br />\ncoffees and a sopaipilla.

The first of these, \"Visitor<br />\nfrom New York,\" introduces William Warren<br />\n(Lyle Roberts), a 45-year-old divorcee who drinks<br />\ntea instead of liquor, has given up on cigarettes<br />\nand Snickers bars, runs five miles and swims<br />\ntwenty laps a day, and eats organically-grown<br />\nfood.<br />\nA native New Yorker, William goes to the suite<br />\nto visit his first ex-wife, Hannah (Sarah Morton),<br />\nwho has trekked to California to persuade their<br />\nonly daughter to return with her to New York.<br />\n42 years old, still living in New York, Hannah<br />\neats chili burgers\u2014on wheat bread, she informs<br /><br />\nhim with a sneer\u2014and visits her analyst regularly. She buries her emotions under a dense layer<br />\nof caustic, sarcastic remark\u2014what Billy (as she<br />\ndubs him) calls her \"train of venom.\" Despite<br />\nthe facade, Hannah eventually reveals her warmer<br />\nside: that of a caring mother scared at the notion<br />\nof losing her daughter.<br />\nMorton and Roberts were both successful in<br />\nproviding the audience with a keen sense of the<br />\nshifting emotions between them.'Although there<br />\nwere some uneasy black spaces in dialogue, both<br />\nactors had some poignant moments. Roberts spoke<br />\nwell and came across convincingly, and Morton<br />\nat times offered piercing glimpses of the pain<br />\nbehind Hannah's rough exterior. Near the end of<br />\nthe scene, she admits to Billy, \"I'm not always<br />\nfond of me, either,\" and the line resonates strongly with all that we've seen.<br />\n\"She was attractive,\" says Marvin Michaels in<br />\nscene two of the play. \"She was a little tight and<br />\nshe was paid for.\" This is Michaels' explanation<br />\nto his wife, Millie (Elin Hilderbrand), for the unconscious prostitute (Aliza Lirtzman) lying dormant in the suite's double bed. The Michaels, who<br />\nhave come from Philadelphia for their nephew's<br />\nbar mitzvah, are a couple who plan for the worst<br />\nin life: they take separate flights out to California so as not to risk making their children orphans.<br /><br />\nElisse Takara<br /><br />\nSarah Morton (left) and Lyle Roberts in the Hopkins Barnstormers' recent production of Neil Simon's<br />\n\"California Suite\"<br />\nThe scene centers on Marvin's attempts to conceal the prostitute from his wife, and then, after<br />\nhe confesses the truth, on her reaction to the news.<br />\n,The scene is good\u2014fast-paced and sharp\u2014and<br />\nMcColl and Hilderbrand aptly underscore its<br />\nhumor.

But because<br />\nweird doesn't necessarily mean good, the<br />\nAcademy sits mute\u2014and with good reason. Annaud, who directed the notably wordless \"Quest<br />\nfor Fire,\" here takes one step up the evolutionary<br />\nladder, from cavemen to bears. While the result<br />\nis admirably fresh, the exercise seems intended<br />\nmore to satisfy the director than to enlighten the<br />\npublic.<br />\nThere are plenty of bear antics and less than two<br />\ndozen lines of dialogue in \"The Bear.\" From the<br />\nfirst, it's bears and more bears, although there is<br />\nsome strong supporting work by other members<br />\nof the animal kingdom\u2014deer, frogs, dogs, chipmunks, horses, and a brilliant puma cameo in the<br /><br />\nMarianne Rosentiehl<br /><br />\nTwo bears in a scene from, well, \"The Bear\"<br />\nfinale. \"The Bear\" is definitely a film that shows,<br />\nrather than tells, its story to the audience.<br />\nAnd the story here is so simple that it defies<br />\ncomplex description. Bear cub Youk and his<br />\nmother enjoy honey as much as the next bear; in<br />\nfact, a taste for honey is perhaps the only bear<br />\ncliche there is. But in \"Winnie the Pooh,\" for<br />\nexample, main characters aren't crushed by<br />\nboulders while looking for it, as Youk's mother<br /><br />\nis here.<br />\nThese are the opening scenes of \"The Bear,\"<br />\nand they are remarkably expressive, considering<br />\nthat not a single word is spoken in the first fiften minutes. Youk's mother lies dead beneath<br />\nthe boulder that took her life, Youk lies next to<br />\nher, still swatting at an occasional bee. He uses<br />\nhis hind legs to stand up, but his head remains<br />\nresting on his mother's fur.

Youk<br />\nand Kaar meet in the mountains and, after exchanging some traditional tongue-lapping, they set<br />\noff together, forced into a final confrontation with<br />\ntheir pursuers.<br />\nIt's all very pleasant to watch, but the film has<br />\nsome obvious limitations. Annaud and his team<br />\nof trainers certainly do a job with the animals; Jim<br />\nHenson's animatronic bears are necessary only<br />\nwhen Youk eats some hallucinogenic mushrooms<br />\nand dreams about flying bears. The real bears in<br />\nthe film amaze with their versatility and emotion:<br />\nKnar, for example, was taught to limp for two<br />\nyears. But how many different facial expressions<br />\ncan a bear muster? And what conclusions should<br />\nwe draw from the fact that bears make the same<br />\nsounds while mating and while nursing gunshot<br />\nwounds?<br />\nThere are some logistical problems with \"The<br />\nBear,\" as well. At one point, Youk hurtles down<br />\na stretch of rapids, then grabs hold of a rock in<br />\nthe middle of the river. When we next see him,<br />\nhe is frolicking on the prairie, chasing a chipmunk<br />\nand eating those mushrooms. Yet it may be easy<br />\nto gloss over these lapses in \"plot\" since Youk<br />\nis, well, just so doggone cute.<br />\nNo one said that baby bears were smart.

But when<br />\nthe mission is to bolster the muchlamented social life at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, few steps<br />\ncan be considered too drastic.<br />\nMost Hopkins students aren't<br />\naware that Chester's Place, one<br />\nof the most consistent sources of<br />\nentertainment on campus, has<br />\nbeen presenting live music in the<br />\nLittle Theater for almost twenty<br />\nyears. Named for Chaplain<br />\nEmeritus Chester Wickwire,<br />\nChester's was founded by<br />\ngraduate students anxious to provide an outlet for the frustrations<br /><br />\nof Hopkins life.<br />\nChester's was first a coffee<br />\nhouse, where students: went to<br />\nplay and listen to music, read<br />\npoetry, dance, and generally unwind in a relaxed social setting.<br />\nUnder the direction of David<br />\nFishkin, who ran the club through<br />\nthe mid-1970s, Chester's soon<br />\nbecame a showcase for local<br />\nbands and performers. Musicians<br />\nfrom the Baltimore area and the<br />\nHopkins community came to put<br />\non free shows in hopes of gaining support for their acts.<br />\nFishkin<br />\nentered<br />\nsemiretirement in 1985; since then a<br />\nnumber of undergraduates have<br />\nbeen selected as honorary<br />\n\"Chesters\"\u2014people responsible<br />\nfor recruiting and promoting the<br />\nband's who come to Chester's<br />\nPlace.

These five are<br />\nno more than sketches, and are hardly cohesive; perhaps director Thom<br />\nEberhardt didn't take chemistry.<br />\n(Unfortunately, the film glosses over<br />\nthe most intriguing of the five: Kim<br />\nMcCauley (Alice Carter), who has<br />\na baby and is expecting another during spring semester.) Joe Slovak<br />\n(Matthew Modine) is conceited, irreverent, and annoying. He's supposed to be brilliant, but Modine<br />\ncomes off like Dr. Joker,<br />\ntransplanted from his role in \"Full<br />\nMetal Jacket.\" He adores his analretentive lab partner Laurie Rorbach<br />\n(Daphne Zuniga), and is challenged<br />\nby Dr. Rachel Woodruff(Christine<br />\nLahti), who is little more than a<br />\n\"Paper Chase\" clone. Instead of<br />\nstudying, Joe pursues Laurie, who<br />\njogs all the time and doesn't seem to<br />\nstudy much herself. In fact, it is<br />\nbookworm David Schreiner (Todd<br />\nField), who takes speed and rises at<br />\n4:30 to study, who is \"asked to<br />\nleave.\" One gets the feeling that<br />\nnone of these people will ever be<br />\nqualified to be doctors: the students<br />\nwho study the most flunk out. \"St.<br />\nElsewhere\" keeps looking better and<br />\nbetter.<br />\nA DRY WHITE SEASON<br />\nEuzhan Palcy's South African<br />\ndocu-drama may play loosely with<br />\nthe facts, but the result is overpowering. History teacher Ben du Toit<br />\n(Donald Sutherland) lives the ideal<br />\nlife of a white South African,<br />\ndistanced from and largely ignorant<br />\nof his country's racial unrest. It takes<br />\nthe horrible murder of his gardener's<br />\nson (during the 1976 Soweto uprising) to draw him into the atrocities<br />\nof Apartheid, much to the dismay of<br />\nhis family and the South African<br />\nspecial police. Marlon Brando submits a top-flight performance as rotund barrister Sheldon McKenzie, an<br />\nover-the-hill civil rights champion<br />\nwho takes one final case. Ben's life<br /><br />\nunravels as he becomes inextricably<br />\nlinked to the cause of freedom, and<br />\nhe lives his final days much like the<br />\nSouth African blacks he has finally<br />\nmade an effort to understand. \"A<br />\nDry White Season\" has a heavy<br />\nmoral message, but Palcy makes that<br />\nclear from the opening moments:<br />\nthere's no deception or disappointment. Besides, the moral is the right<br />\none, and tautly presented.<br />\nTHE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS<br />\nMichelle Pfeiffer is Susie Diamond, the gum-chewing, sultrytoned wonder who breathes life into<br />\nSteve Kloves' directorial debut with<br />\nevery breath she takes. Beau and Jeff<br />\nBridges play Frank and Jack Baker,<br />\nlounge lizards on the ropes until<br />\nSusie stumbles into their life and<br />\ntakes their stale piano act (and the<br />\nfilm) to another plane. Pfeiffer<br />\nstakes her claim as perhaps the most<br />\nbeautiful and sexy film actress in<br />\nhistory. Diamond isn't a role she<br />\nsinks her teeth into\u2014she sort of<br />\nwraps herself around it. The scenes<br />\nof the Boys and Susie together have<br />\nan undeniable chemistry and a<br />\nwonderful feel, which makes Susie's<br />\nexit all the more frustrating. She's<br />\nstrangely absent from the final act,<br />\nand we're left with Frank, stuck in<br />\nsuburbia with the kids; and Jack,<br />\nmoping about his failures as a blues<br />\npianist. Meanwhile, Susie, the<br />\ncatalyst, has gone to sing vegetable<br />\ncommercials. As \"The Fabulous<br />\nBaker Boys\" ends, you may wonder<br />\nwhy Kloves chose to break up such<br />\na successful trio.<br /><br />\nAN INNOCENT MAN<br />\nPeter Yates' prison drama is as<br />\npredictable and intelligence-insulting<br />\nas a bad TV movie. Tom Selleck<br />\nplays Jimmie Rainwood, a triumphant airline mechanic sent to prison<br />\nfor a crime he didn't commit. While<br />\nin the big house, he watches a friend<br />\nburn to death and observes the gangrape of a white prisoner by a group<br />\nof black inmates, just for starters.<br />\nHow could Selleck be anything but<br />\ninnocent? He's predictably spineless<br />\nin prison, but when he gets paroled<br />\nafter three years he's still a wimp,<br />\neven with the tutelage of prison<br />\nstrongman Virgil Cane (F. Murray<br />\nAbraham). It would have been nice<br />\nfor Selleck to turn into a sadistic<br />\nkiller when he gets out of jail, but<br /><br />\nRichard Cartwright<br /><br />\nhe looks as ready for a \"Magnum<br />\nPt.\" reunion as ever. Screenwriter<br />\nand ex-con Larry Brothers offers a<br />\ntaste of gritty prison life, but the<br />\ndrama doesn't hold when the<br />\ncharacters try to speak. The best<br />\nthing about \"An Innocent Man\"<br />\nis that the improvements made in the<br />\nCalifornia and Ohio prisons for the<br />\nfilm were left intact after shooting.<br />\n(Love the new electrified fence!)<br />\nPerhaps the filmmakers should have<br />\nbeen left there as well.<br />\nBLACK RAIN<br />\nRidley Scott's vision of a gleaming Osaka is haunting, but it drops<br />\nlike a lead weight in this overburdened Japan-bashing thriller and star<br />\nvehicle for Michael Douglas.<br />\nDouglas plays the crabby and slightly crooked New York Detective<br />\nNick Conklin who, along with partner Charlie Vincent(Andy Garcia),<br />\nmust escort Mafia wunderkind Sato<br />\n(Yusaku Matsuda) back to Japan<br />\nfrom New York City. But the<br />\nbumbling New Yorkers deliver Sato<br />\nright into the Mafia's hands, and<br />\nthey are forced to stay in Osaka until they find him and clear Conklin's<br />\nname. Garcia shines as Vincent, and<br />\nhis early exit leaves \"Black Rain\"<br />\nwanting. Kate Capshaw, irrelevant<br />\nas the wisecracking geisha girl Joyce<br />\nKingsley, gets the film's hokiest<br />\nlines and silliest scenes.' Black<br />\nRain\" is satisfying entertainment,<br />\neven if it can't stand up to scrutiny.<br />\nBut as it ends, you may feel like<br />\nyou've seen most of this before.,<br />\nperhaps in Scott's other big hit,<br />\n\"Blade Runner.\"<br /><br />\n\u2014Mark Friedman<br /><br />\nCHESTER'S<br />\nfrom 13<br />\nsmoothly, and J.R.

We get a rare opportunity to watch the<br />\nhunted through their own eyes, and the message<br />\nis clear: it ain't fun to be hunted. One could go<br />\non for hours about the metaphors in \"The Bear\";<br />\nthe film makes you do a lot of the work yourself,<br />\nbut it isn't entirely fruitless labor.<br />\nThe anti-hunting message in \"The Bear\" is selfexplanatory. Yet Annaud somehow skips the<br />\nchance to hammer it home. When Kaar at last confronts the hunter who shot him, he merely growls<br />\nand swats at him. Now, if Kaar had mauled him,<br />\nmaybe ripped off his arm, then that would be a<br />\ndeterrent to hunters.

While \"The Bear\" does<br />\ncontain moments of violence, there's no point in<br />\ndisguising the film's appeal to children.

The transition of characters McColl made<br />\nfrom the second to the third scene was<br />\nimpressive\u2014some members of the audience didn't<br />\nrealize he was the same person.<br />\nThe fourth scene in \"California Suite\" is a continuation of the third. It takes place after the Oscars<br />\nceremony, from which Diane returns emptyhanded. McColl and Tesoriero wind through a<br />\nwhirlwind of emoiions, from depression to affection to anger and exasperation. The acting grows<br />\ntruly strong by scene's end, leaving the audience<br />\nwith the same feeling of emptiness that plagues<br />\nDiane.<br />\nThe pains and benefits of vacationing with<br />\nfriends are the focus of the fifth and final scene,<br />\nwhich, like the rest of the play, is filled with sharp<br />\none-liners. These comical barbs, however,<br />\nwouldn't have worked without the sly humor of<br />\nthis last scene's cast. Mort and Beth Hollander<br />\n(Matt Lindsay and Mona Foad) and Gert and Stu<br />\nFranklyn (Kara Stein and Dave Howe) are two<br />\ncouples from Chicago, and their vacation is<br />\nphysical in the extreme, from the point at which<br />\nBeth hurts her foot at tennis to the scene's conclusion, when Stu and Mort end up wrestling on<br />\nthe floor.<br />\nThe audience witnesses more than physical<br />\nblows, however. These actors generate true comedy, making one think at times that Chevy Chase<br />\nis on stage, tripping and falling, as the audience<br />\nsends laughter filtering through the auditorium.<br />\nParticularly memorable was Stein's character, clad<br />\nin fluorescent green, pink, and black, and constantly getting attention with her high-pitched,<br />\nNew Yorker accent.<br />\nDespite these shortcomings, \"The Bear\" has<br />\nits moments. Still, this may be a film more to admire than enjoy. It is by no means a failure: the<br />\nfirst fifteen minutes are thrilling, even if they do<br />\nlook like something from \"The Wonderful World<br />\nof Disney.\" Most of the film has an assuring<br />\nrealism, something all too uncommon in cinema<br />\ntoday.

Cole, Research Administrator for the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, admitted that<br />\n\"many faculty prefer to seek out<br />\nsponsors on their own.\"<br />\nHowever his colleague, Joan F.<br />\nWarfield, handling the G.W.C.<br />\nWhiting School of Engineering,<br />\nadded, \"We are continually<br />\nreceiving announcements and<br />\ndisseminating information to<br />\nfaculty on programs which might<br />\nbe of interest to them.\"<br />\nThe faculty and students either<br />\nplod through the extensive collection of program announcements<br />\ncompiled in the Administration's<br />\nin-house library or do a computerized search on SPIN and<br />\nIRIS.<br /><br />\nSPIN (Sponsored Programs Information System) and IRIS (Illinois Researcher Information<br />\nSystem) are available to anyone<br />\nat Hopkins, and the University administration covers all costs,<br />\nwhich amount to approximately<br />\n$6,000 per year.<br />\nUsers enter in personal dataeducational background, areas of<br />\ninterest, citizenship status, nature<br />\nof research, etc. In a matter of<br />\nminutes, the system comes up<br />\nwith a number of programs compatible with the researchers' interests and qualifications. Approximately one week later, users<br />\nreceive a computerized report<br />\nlisting detailed information about<br />\nthe sponsors and programs.<br />\nAccording to John Paul Elrod,<br />\nElectronic Data Processing<br />\nManager for University Sponsored Projects, the majority of<br />\nusers are from the Medical<br />\nSchool in East Baltimore, and<br />\n\"since Homewood Schools are in<br />\nneed of money... Arts and<br />\nSciences and Engineering need to<br />\ntake advantage of all opportunities available.., to maximize<br />\nefforts to gain additional funding<br />\nfor their schools.\" \"However,\"<br />\nadded Elrod, \"they are just tools<br />\nfor researchers... it's up to them<br />\nto decide whether or not to contact a sponsor for further details<br />\nand eventually to submit a proposal... and funding is never<br />\nguaranteed.\"<br />\nThe Homewood Research Administrators estimated that 55Zof<br />\nthe faculty in Arts and Sciences<br />\nand Agof the Engineering faculty are actively involved in sponsored research. \"These figures<br /><br />\nhave nothing to do with the quality of the faculty but rather with<br />\nthe general availability of funding<br />\nfor certain areas of research,\" explained Cole.<br />\n\"The various departments in<br />\nthe School of Engineering tend to<br />\nbe extremely active across the<br />\nboard, whereas in Arts and<br />\nSciences, for somebody in the<br />\nlanguage department for example, there's just not a lot of fundable research out there,\" he<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nAccording to Dean Howard,<br />\nHopkins researchers are quite<br />\nsuccessful at receiving funding.<br />\n\"The national success rate for<br />\nnew proposals is ice while ours<br />\nis an impressive 35-4T Continuation proposals,' remarked Dean<br />\n\"are<br />\nHoward,<br />\nalmost<br />\nguaranteed.\" She concluded,<br />\n\"Our faculty submit very good<br />\nquality proposals for very good<br />\nquality research.\"<br />\nA formal proposal, says Dean<br />\nHoward, \"basically explains the<br />\nnature of the proposed research,<br />\nwhy they [the professors] want to<br />\ndo the research, why the agency<br />\nshould fund it, and how much it<br />\nwill cost.\"<br />\nDr. Marian Fischman from the<br />\nDepartment of Psychiatry and<br />\nBehavioral Sciences outlined four<br />\nbasic sections of a proposal: (1)<br />\nspecific aims;(2) significancehow the research fits into the<br />\ngeneral area of science; (3)<br />\npreliminary data; and (4)general<br />\nmethod.<br />\nComFischman<br />\nDr.<br />\nmented that \"the best element [in<br />\na successful proposal] is a good<br />\nidea.\" However, she also stress-<br /><br />\nThe unfortunate (hic!) nature of hiccups<br />\nby Melanie Chellman<br />\nNearly all people have, at one<br />\ntime or another, experienced a<br />\ncase of hiccups. While humorous<br />\nto most, there are some to whom<br />\nhiccups are no laughing matter.<br />\nWhen hiccups are incessant for<br />\nseveral days, the victim endures<br />\na great deal of stress, depending<br />\non the severity of the case. At the<br />\nrate of ten to twenty hiccups per<br />\nminute, a man has lived, hiccuping for over 65 years. That's<br />\nmore than half a billion hiccups!<br />\nDespite the ubiquity of the hiccup, the rareness of death from<br />\nit has motivated few researchers<br />\nto consider its physiology. The<br />\nones who have studied hiccups<br />\nhave noted the entangled web of<br />\napparently unrelated causes and<br />\nassociated conditions, ranging<br />\nfrom heart attack to a bug in the<br />\near. In addition, the successful<br /><br />\ncures for hiccups are equally<br />\ndiverse, and may not always correlate with the postulated cause.<br />\nThe hiccup mechanism is<br />\ncharacterized by an abrupt inspiratory muscle discharge punctuated by an associated audible<br />\nglottal closure. The intensity of<br />\nthe discharge is much greater than<br />\nthat of ordinary breathing, but<br />\nuses a similar motion. The hiccup always occurs in an inspiratory motion, briefly inhibiting any expiration taking<br />\nplace in the respiratory cycle. In<br />\na detailed study of three individuals suffering from hiccups,<br />\nit was also seen that hiccups are<br />\nmuch more likely to occur in the<br />\ninspiratory phase of breathing<br />\nthan the expiratory phase.<br />\nAdditional characteristics of the<br />\nhiccup arising from the study<br />\nwere that the frequency and<br /><br />\ned the need to \"carefully design<br />\nand clearly describe an experiment that will answer a particular<br />\nquestion and raise other questions<br />\nupon which further research may<br />\nbe built.\" The experiment must<br />\nbe also feasible with respect to the<br />\navailability of precious resources<br />\nsuch as time, money, personnel<br />\nand equipment.<br />\nAnother important factor in<br />\nsecuring research grants and contracts is establishing a reputation<br />\namongst one's peers by conducting experiments, publishing<br />\nresults and submitting papers.<br />\nDr. Robert Kelly of Chemical<br />\nEngineering described the dilemma that inexperienced junior professors face: \"It's like the<br />\nchicken and egg phenomenonto get support you need previous<br />\nresults. To get previous results<br />\nyou need grants and contracts.\"<br />\nThe more experienced researchers have established lines of<br />\nsupport and must then concentrate their efforts on \"maintaining a level of excellence in<br />\nresearch,\" contrasted Prof.<br />\nKelly.<br />\n\"Research livelihood is based<br />\non bringing in funds; consequently there is a lot of support built<br />\ninto the University structure... Interested senior faculty go out of<br />\ntheir way to help junior faculty<br />\nmembers in learning about the<br />\nprocess, making contacts... but,<br />\nthen it all comes down to how<br />\ntalented and energetic an individual is... the bottom line [for<br />\nresearchers] is the quality of the<br />\nwork they do and how well<br />\nregarded Iby peers] they are as<br />\npublished authorities.\"<br />\nProposals are evaluated<br />\nthrough a system of \"peer<br />\nreview,\" in which an individual<br />\nor panel of experts in a particular<br />\nfield(s) related to the topic or the<br />\nproposal assign each proposal a<br /><br />\namplitude of hiccups were not<br />\nrelated, but controlled independently. This is manifested<br />\nin the fact that raising blood levels<br />\nof carbon dioxide either by<br />\nbreathing gaseous carbon dioxide<br />\nor holding the breath decreased<br />\nthe frequency, usually to the point<br />\nof stopping the hiccups, without<br />\naffecting the amplitude in any<br />\nway. When stopped by carbon<br />\ndioxide and removed from the<br />\noriginal stimulus, hiccups do not<br />\nreturn, implying that there is<br />\nsome hiccup feature which<br />\nperpetuates the case.<br />\nWhile hiccuping is a primitive<br />\nreflex action, unlike coughing or<br />\nsneezing it has no obvious<br />\nphysiological function. In some<br />\ncases it prevents passage of food<br />\nfrom the esophagus to the<br />\nstomach, but this is hardly a<br />\nuniversal trait. Other possible<br />\nfunctions remain obscure.<br /><br />\nDonna Williamson<br />\nJohn Paul Elrod helps computerize the quest for grants.<br /><br />\npriority score ranging from very<br />\nimportant to least important. The<br />\nsponsor or agency then allocates<br />\nthe funds based on the experts'<br />\nfindings.<br />\n\"The peer review system is an<br />\nimpressive one,\" remarked Prof.<br />\nFischman, \"and I believe very<br />\nfair in the way money is awarded. Of course,\" she continued,<br />\n\"the agency has the final say, but<br />\nit tends to stick closely to the<br />\npriority scores as voted by the<br />\nreviewers.\"<br />\nThere is one major source of<br />\nfrustration inherent in the system<br />\nof granting funds which each professor mentioned or alluded to.<br />\nDr. Kelly called it the \"luck of<br />\nthe draw,\" explaining that certain<br />\nfactors are beyond the researchers' control.<br />\nProf. John Ferry from the<br />\nDepartment of Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Sciences commented<br />\nthat his biggest frustration is the<br />\nfact that organizations like the<br />\nNational Science Foundation do<br />\nnot have enough money<br />\nthemselves to be able to supply<br />\nresearchers with the full amount<br />\nthey require to carry on proposed research. Therefore, professors are \"always writing<br />\ngrants and submitting new proposals,\" which detracts from<br />\ntheir actual research and<br />\nacademic pursuits.<br />\nProf. Kelly reflected on the<br />\nresearchers' motivations for<br />\nsoliciting funds, \"The essence of<br />\nwhy you go after all this money<br /><br />\nis to provide a proper research<br />\nenvironment that graduate<br />\nstudents can experience.., in<br />\norder to make them significant<br />\npeople in the field they're working in... once they get out on their<br />\nown.\"<br />\nProf. Ferry offered further<br />\nmotivations for conducting basic<br />\nresearch, with which his fellow<br />\nscientists agree wholeheartedly.<br />\n\"We justify our work on two<br />\nlevels.., first it is beneficial to increase our knowledge and<br />\nunderstanding of how nature<br />\nworks, and secondly practical applications will invariably come<br />\n[from such research whether or<br />\nnot such applications were<br />\nforeseen].\"<br /><br />\nThe Squid<br />\nWhy do we have earwax?<br />\nEarwax repels bugs and<br />\nkeeps the skin of the ear canal<br />\nand the eardrum from drying<br />\nout.

In a<br />\ndefensive struggle in which<br />\nneither team amassed 200 net<br />\nyards, the Georgetown Hoyas<br />\nstopped the Jays, 20-7, before a<br />\nParents' Weekend crowd of more<br />\nthan 2000.<br />\nThe Jays got off to another<br />\nquick start after forcing the Hoyas<br />\nto punt on four downs on the first<br />\npossession. Hopkins drove the<br />\nball from its own 38-yard line to<br />\nthe Hoya 31-yard line in five<br />\nplays; but on the next play,<br />\nquarterback Jay Simons fumbled<br />\nthe ball and the Hoyas recovered.<br />\nThe Jays stopped Georgetown<br />\non four downs, but Hopkins also<br />\nhad to punt on four downs. On<br />\nthe return, the Hoyas' Matt<br />\nMcLaughlin ran 30 yards to the<br />\nJays' 36. The Hoyas advanced<br />\nthe ball to the six where they settled for a 23-yard field goal by<br />\nTom Timperman.<br />\nThe Jays didn't return to Hoya<br />\nterritory until the second quarter,<br />\nand then got no closer than the<br />\n35-yard line.<br />\nIn the second quarter, the<br />\nHoyas scored twice on defensive<br />\nseries. First, the Jays faced a<br />\nthird-and-eleven from their 32,<br />\nand Simons was intercepted by<br />\nfreshman defensive back Jim<br />\nBolger, who returned the catch<br /><br />\nfor a touchdown. The point-after<br />\nput the Hoyas up 10-0.<br />\nLater in the quarter, John<br />\nGuglielmo, who replaced Simons<br />\nat quarterback, fumbled; the ball<br />\npopped straight into the air and<br />\ninto the hands of defensive<br />\nlineman Nabil Al-Sabih, who<br />\noutsprinted all for a 27-yard<br />\ntouchdown. The extra point put<br />\nthe Hoyas up 17-0 with 49<br />\nseconds left in the half.<br />\nThe Jays lone touchdown came<br />\nin the third quarter when, on<br />\nthird and ten, Coach Pfeifer pulled a rabbit out of his hat, calling<br />\nthe hook and ladder play.<br />\nGuglielmo connected with<br />\nreceiver Brandon Rosser, who<br />\nthen lateraled to running back<br />\nErik Mont for a 77-yard<br />\ntouchdown play. John Darre's<br />\nkick moved the Jays within 13.<br />\nDarre also returned punts for the<br />\nJays, and set a Blue Jay record<br />\nwith seven punt returns in one<br />\ngame.<br />\nOn the following series, running back J.J. Williams fumbled<br />\nand the Jays recovered on the<br />\nHoya 18. The momentum was in<br />\nfavor of the Jays only momentarily. Two plays later, Guglielmo<br />\nwas facing a third-and-22 from<br />\nthe 30, and then on fourthand-23, the Jays advanced only<br />\n11 yards.<br />\nAfter that, the Jays never got<br />\ncloser than the Hoya 38-yard line.<br /><br />\nAnother Timperman field goal<br />\nput the Hoyas up 20-7 and completed the scoring.<br />\n\"Defense as a whole did a<br />\ngreat job on both sides,\" said<br />\njunior linebacker Kevin Fitzpatrick. \"Their defense came up<br />\nwith 14 points while their offense<br />\nnever scored a TD.\"<br />\nOffensively, Simons and<br />\nGuglielmo went a combined 12 of<br />\n36 for 151 yards, including the<br />\ntouchdown catch of 77 yards. On<br />\nthe ground, the Jays averaged a<br />\nnet gain of 1.0 yards per carry on<br />\n29 carries. The Hoyas averaged<br />\n1.9 yards per carry on 45 carries,<br />\nwhile their attack yielded a 15.1<br />\nyard average per catch.<br />\n\"They're the worst offense<br />\nwe'll see this year,\" said senior<br />\ncaptain Steve Davis. \"We had<br />\nplenty of opportunities to score.<br />\nTraditionally, we're a passing<br />\nteam.

Junior<br />\ngoaltender Dave Bowyer was<br />\noutstanding in the net as he made<br />\n18 saves, but he was quick to<br />\ncredit his defense for much of his<br />\nsuccess. \"Our guys really put the<br />\nclamp on their offense. It was a<br />\nchallenge for me to keep my concentration while facing so few<br />\nshots.\"<br />\nThe offense, thought to be the<br />\nquestion mark for the team, provided the needed punch with a<br />\nbalanced scoring attack in which<br />\nfive different Blue Jays scored.<br />\nThe first period began as a<br />\nstalemate as both teams held<br />\nthe other in check for the first 6<br />\nminutes. The Jays drew first<br />\nblood, however, as freshman<br />\nJason Sprague sent a beautiful<br />\npass across the middle to senior<br />\nJack Calkins, who was waiting on<br />\nthe left post to drive it home. One<br />\nminute later, Sprague completed<br />\na spin move to open up the ice<br />\nand again found Calkins on the<br />\npost where Jack was able to collect his second goal of the night.<br />\nThe Jays maintained this torrid<br /><br />\nfirst period pace when playmaker<br />\nSprague assisted for the third time<br />\nby hitting Pierre DeMatos high in<br />\nthe slot. DeMatos took one step<br />\ntoward the goal before rifling a<br />\nshot past the left shoulder of<br />\nSalisbury's goalie to give<br />\nHopkins a 3-0 advantage.<br />\nAfter letting up a goal at the tail<br />\nend of the first period, the<br />\nstickmen took the ice in the second period looking to leave their<br />\nopponents in the dust. Right from<br />\nthe opening whistle the Jays were<br />\nall over them, and the hustle paid<br />\noff. Jon Lowthert took a pass<br />\nfrom senior captain Mike<br />\nHolmes deep in his own zone.<br />\nLowthert skated the puck by two<br />\ndefenders before making a blind<br />\nbehind the back pass to Norm<br />\nShephard, who was wide open in<br />\nfront of the net. Shephard easily<br />\nbeat the Salisbury goalie to extend<br />\nthe Jays' lead to 4-1.<br />\nAfter a 7-minute lull in the action, Phil Schied made a superb<br />\ndefensive play when he successfully thwarted the efforts of<br />\ntwo rushing Salisbury forwards.<br />\nSeeing the five-on-three advantage he had created, Schied found<br />\nKirk Perry all alone beyond the<br />\nSalisbury defense. Perry approached the goal on a difficult<br />\nangle from the right side, but was<br />\nstill able to slip the puck between<br />\nthe legs of the opposing<br />\ngoaltender.<br />\nA minute and a half later<br /><br />\nHolmes found Dave Boxenbaum<br />\nat center ice, where Boxenbaum<br />\nwas able to beat two deferders in<br />\norder to set up a snap shot from<br />\n15 feet out. Salisbury's goalie appeared to make the save, but<br />\njuggled the puck into his own net<br />\nto make the score 6-1.<br />\nSalisbury responded to this last<br />\ngoal 50 seconds later, but were<br />\nunable to create any momentum<br />\nfor themselves.<br />\nThe third period provided no<br />\nscoring, due largely to fine<br />\ngoaltending. Bowyer frustrated<br />\nthe Salisbury offense by making<br />\nrepeated saves. \"He's unbeatable<br />\non that glove side,\" commented<br />\nHolmes.<br />\nThe season-opening victory<br />\nwas very satisfying for the team,<br />\nbut they realize that the Salisbury<br />\nsquad was not representative of<br />\nthe type of competition they will<br />\nface this season. \"It was a great<br />\nwin,\" offered Coach Steve<br />\nWirth, \"but we're going to have<br />\nto improve even more in order to<br />\nbe competitive in league play.<br />\nAgainst teams like Georgetown<br />\nwe have to stay intense for the<br />\nwhole game and not just for two<br />\nperiods like today.\"<br />\nNext up for the hockey team is<br />\nrival Western Maryland on Saturday at 7:15 p.m. at Northwest Ice<br />\nRink, on Falls Road and Kelly<br />\nStreet in Mount Washington<br />\nVillage.<br /><br />\nNoon Mid-week non-denominational service in the Little Theatre, Levering Hall.<br />\nSponsored by ihe Office of the Chaplain.<br />\n8 p.m. Cultural Fest '89 moves along with the CSA nightly movie, \"Split Spirit\"<br />\nin Remsen 101,<br /><br />\nWednesday, November 1<br />\nNoon The Wednesday Noon Series presents \"Dancers of the Third Age: A Senior<br />\nAdults Mqdern Dance Group\" in the Garrett Room of the MSE Library.<br />\n5 p.m. With Cultural Fest '89 in high gear, the BSU presents a workshop by<br />\nthe Olu African Dance Troupe in the Arellano Theatre.<br />\n7 p.m. After dancing, come watch the NSA film, \"Tampopo\" in the AMR I<br />\nTV room.<br />\n7:30 p.m. The \"Women on the Screen: Film &amp; Feminism Series\" presents<br />\nMarianne &amp; Juliane in the Main Auditorium of the Preclinical Teaching Building<br />\nat the Medical School.<br />\n8 p.m. The CSA show their nightly movie, \"Black Skin and White Tooth\" in<br />\nNEB room B-21.<br /><br />\nThursday, November 2<br />\n4 p.m. Valerie Thornhill will be giving a lecture on \"The Unique Vision of the<br />\nEnglish Coantry House and Garden\" in the Garrett Room of the MSE Library.<br />\n6 p.m. Co ne view a slideshow of the Soviet Union and Northern Italy by Dr.<br />\nAranow in NEB 123.<br />\n6 p.m. Watch an NSA karate demonstration in the athletic center.<br />\n8 p.m. Lauro Cavazos, U.S. Secretary of Education, will be lecturing on The<br />\nRole ofHigher Education in Restructuring Elementary and Secondary Education<br />\nin the first MSE symposium of the year at Shriver Hall<br />\n8 p.m. Listen to a CIG lecture, \"Social and Cultural Aspects of Cricket\" by Dr.<br />\nMaurice Saint-Pierre in Ma.ryland 104.<br />\n8 p.m. The CSA present their final movie of the week,\"The Tan Shui\" in Remsen<br />\n101<br />\n9 p.m. Ole presents the final event of Cultural Fest '89, the film \"Erendira,'<br />\nin Maryland 110.<br /><br />\n20/OCTOBER 27, 1989<br /><br />\nClimbing Behind<br /><br />\n'THE AMERICAN DREAM\"<br /><br />\nCrew races well<br />\nMen's X-C wins at Head<br />\nof the Charles<br /><br />\nWhat does it offer and what<br />\ndoes it cost?<br /><br />\nby 1ngebord Schlate<br />\nand Kelly Kieffer<br /><br />\nAre there other offers<br />\nout there?<br />\nCome and consider this topic<br />\nat an Open Talk for<br />\nthe Hopkins community.<br />\nFriday, October 27th<br />\n7:15 p.m.<br />\nGarrett Room, MSE Library<br />\nAmazing Refreshments to Follow<br />\nSponsored by the<br />\nHopkins Christian Fellowship<br /><br />\nCltstklOUPSand<br />\nPS!<br />\nFa<br /><br />\nWITH<br />\nTHE<br /><br />\ntie<br />\nBullets<br />\n\"MUG NIGHT\"<br />\nBullets vs. Cleveland<br />\nFriday, November 10<br />\n8 PM, Baltimore Arena<br />\nTickets: $10<br />\nFor tickets see Susanna in the Student Activities Office by Friday, Nov 3<br />\nSTUDENT PUGWASH &amp; THE WOMEN'S CENTER<br />\nPRESENT<br /><br />\nMen's cross-country destroyed Washington College at Homewood last<br />\nBill Berger<br />\nSaturday.<br />\nhad no competition throughout<br />\nby Coleen Furey<br />\nthe five-mile race.

It was an<br />\noff-season exhibition without any<br />\neffect on rankings or records.<br />\n\"The worst thing anyone could<br />\ndo now is push the panic button,\"<br />\nsaid head coach Don Zimmerman. \"If anyone should push it,<br />\nit's me, and I'm certainly not.\"<br />\nFor the first 58 minutes of<br />\nregulation, the Blue Jays<br />\ndisplayed a typical, successful<br />\nperformance: the Jays started off<br />\nvery strong, held a slim lead at<br />\nhalftime, dominated the third<br />\nquarter, and were in control in the<br />\nfourth. With a 10-6 Hopkins lead<br />\nand less than two minutes remaining, all looked well. So Zimmerman relaxed and substituted<br />\nextensively.<br />\nBrian Kroneberger cut the<br /><br />\nHopkins margin to three goals<br />\nwith one minute, 52 seconds to<br />\nplay. Still, all was well. Then<br />\ncame the two-pointer. For the<br />\nClassic, Choice Visa introduced<br />\na two-point goal, awarded on any<br />\ngoal scored on a shot taken between the midfield line and a<br />\nsemicircular arc extending 17<br />\nyards from the center of the<br />\ncrease. The two-point goal will<br />\nnot be used in games this spring.<br />\nHopkins had benefitted first<br />\nfrom the innovation, as Greg Kelly beat Loyola goalie Charlie<br />\nToomey from 17 feet with 22<br />\nseconds remaining in the third<br />\nperiod to increase a 7-3 Jay lead<br />\nto 9-3. At that point, the twopoint idea seemed novel, but<br />\nrather insignificant.<br />\nKroneberger's two-pointer<br />\nwith 67 seconds remaining<br />\nchanged that thinking. Suddenly<br />\nthe Greyhounds trailed by only<br />\none goal. Zimmerman returned to<br />\nhis starting troops, but it Was too<br />\nlate. Momentum was lost, and the<br />\n'Hounds were hungry.<br />\nLoyola's Paul Cantabene won<br /><br />\nthe ensuing faceoff, raced down<br />\nthe field, and fired past allAmerican goaltender Quint<br />\nKessenich to tie the game. One<br />\nminute, 47 seconds into overtime<br />\nKroneberger ended it.<br />\n\"I've got to give Loyola a lot<br />\nof credit,\" said Zimmerman.<br />\n\"They hung tough. Not to take<br />\nanything away from them, but I<br />\ntake full responsibility for the<br />\nloss. I learned something about<br />\nthe two-pointer today. I was<br />\ncoaching without thinking about<br />\nit, and I'm at fault for that.\u2014<br />\nLoyola coach Dave Cottle was<br />\nreserved in his enthusiasm about<br />\ndefeating last year's national<br />\nrunner-up. \"It was a good<br />\ngame,\" said the coach, \"but all<br />\nit means is that we played tough<br />\nin a fall game.\"<br />\nSunday, in the tournament's<br />\nconsolation game, the Jays released their frustration on MarylandBaltimore County, earning a 20-6<br />\nconquest.

In tennis, Phi Psi captured<br />\nthe crown, with FIJI second. In<br />\nthe roadrace, the dorms finished<br />\nas follows: Vincent-Willard,<br />\nWood, Jennings, and Jennings.<br />\n(Are you satisfied now, Cathy?)<br />\nIn the event of future confusion,<br />\nup to the minute BIA scores and<br />\nstats may now be accessed 24<br />\nhours a day by calling 976-VINY<br />\n($2.23 for the first minute, $0.95<br />\nfor each additional minute).<br />\nFootball playoffs wrap up next<br />\nweek; there will be no rescheduling. The top seeds are as follows:<br />\nin the independents, the Snapper<br />\nHeads; in the fraternities, WaWa;<br />\nin the dorms, Building A. Watch<br />\nout for the Baboon Heads and<br />\nLazear as dark cows, though.<br />\nOn the BIA horizon looms the<br />\nsoccer tournament and the bike<br />\nrace. Soccer pairings should be<br />\nposted by now, so check at the<br />\ncage (call Jen Chun, 243-4232).<br />\nRed tape is causing delays in the<br />\nscheduling of the bike race, but<br />\nMayor Schmoke is on top of it;<br /><br />\nwatch for posters. In midNovember watch for volleyball.<br />\nNow for some totals in the<br />\nstandings. In the fraternity division, DU holds a comfortable<br />\nlead over Sig Ep, followed by<br />\nWaWa. The dorm division<br />\nfeatures Wilson and Jennings in<br />\na dead heat, followed by VincentWillard. The mighty Woodrow<br />\nholds a slim lead over the Snapper Heads, with the KSA holding<br />\nthird. (Note: these scores do not<br />\ninclude any results from football.)<br />\nNow it's time for the player of<br />\nthe week. Betsy Cox did not win,<br />\nand Ed Rhew did not throw up,<br />\nbut Eric Wasserman did it all for<br />\nWaWa this past week in football.<br />\nHe threw for one TD, caught<br />\nanother, and had three interceptions. Eric receives the Franklin<br />\nMint's Woodland Creatures collection, masterfully crafted of<br />\nhand-painted porcelain with 14karat gold trim.

The test<br />\nfound the range in violation of<br />\nlead dust safety levels, and the<br />\nstate of Maryland condemned and<br />\nsealed the rifle range and fined<br />\nthe Athletic Department $5000.<br />\nThe loss of the range severely<br />\nreduced the amount of practice<br />\nbefore the season's first three<br />\nmatches, and the lack of practice<br />\nshowed itself in the inconsistent<br />\nscores of the teams' top shooters.<br />\nHowever, the team as a whole did<br />\nremarkably well in the first match<br />\nat King's College in Pennsylvania.
