The Pennsylvania team<br />\nwas far superior in the running<br />\nevents. They scored fourteen points<br />\nin the hurdles but one should consider the fact that Hershey, the<br />\nHopkins stellar hurdler, was out of<br />\npractise as he had just come back<br />\nfrom the Geology trip. Hopkins<br />\nwas further handicapped by the fact<br />\nthe Chassin, the star sprinter, had<br />\nnot recovered from a spike wound<br />\nreceived during the Penn Relays.<br />\nHe limped so badly that he could<br />\nnot run properly. In spite of this he<br />\ncame in fourth. The winning of this<br />\nrace in 51.3 seconds indicates that<br />\nChassin would have easily romped<br />\nhome first under more favorable<br />\ncircumstances. Howard- Jung did<br />\nhis best and ran an excellent race.<br />\nBoth the 220-yard low hurdles and<br />\n120-yard high hurdles were taken<br />\nby Parrish, captain of the visiting<br />\nteam. Miller, two-miler, won the<br />\nevent, the first victory of his college career, showing surprisingly<br />\ngood form leading Emerson, a<br />\nteam-mate, and Hooser of the Garnet team, to the tape. Boyer, of<br />\nthe visiting team, just broke the<br />\ntape before Kelly, of the home team,<br />\nwith Thompson third. Until that<br />\ntime Kelly had been one of the<br />\ngreat mainstays of the Hopkins<br />\nteam in the distance events. Because of a weak heart, however, it<br />\nis extremely unlikely that he will<br />\nrun again. Lochard ran a fine race<br />\nin the 100-yard dash and placed<br />\nthird behind Alden and Thomasetty,<br />\nboth of Swarthmore. Alden, as<br />\nwell as Parrish and Brown, were on<br />\nthe team that won the Middle Atlantic States Class B mile relay<br />\nchampionship at the Penn Relays.<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MAY 13, 1930<br />\n<br />\nJUNE WEEK TICKETS<br />\nON SALE TOMORROW<br />\nTickets for the festivities<br />\nof June Week will go on sale<br />\ntomorrow at 12:30 in Levering Hall.

The Pennsylvania team<br />\nwas far superior in the running<br />\nevents. They scored fourteen points<br />\nin the hurdles but one should consider the fact that Hershey, the<br />\nHopkins stellar hurdler, was out of<br />\npractise as he had just come back<br />\nfrom the Geology trip. Hopkins<br />\nwas further handicapped by the fact<br />\nthe Chassin, the star sprinter, had<br />\nnot recovered from a spike wound<br />\nreceived during the Penn Relays.<br />\nHe limped so badly that he could<br />\nnot run properly. In spite of this he<br />\ncame in fourth. The winning of this<br />\nrace in 51.3 seconds indicates that<br />\nChassin would have easily romped<br />\nhome first under more favorable<br />\ncircumstances. Howard- Jung did<br />\nhis best and ran an excellent race.<br />\nBoth the 220-yard low hurdles and<br />\n120-yard high hurdles were taken<br />\nby Parrish, captain of the visiting<br />\nteam. Miller, two-miler, won the<br />\nevent, the first victory of his college career, showing surprisingly<br />\ngood form leading Emerson, a<br />\nteam-mate, and Hooser of the Garnet team, to the tape. Boyer, of<br />\nthe visiting team, just broke the<br />\ntape before Kelly, of the home team,<br />\nwith Thompson third. Until that<br />\ntime Kelly had been one of the<br />\ngreat mainstays of the Hopkins<br />\nteam in the distance events. Because of a weak heart, however, it<br />\nis extremely unlikely that he will<br />\nrun again. Lochard ran a fine race<br />\nin the 100-yard dash and placed<br />\nthird behind Alden and Thomasetty,<br />\nboth of Swarthmore.
