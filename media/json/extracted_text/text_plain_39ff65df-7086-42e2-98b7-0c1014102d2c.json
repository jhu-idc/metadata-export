The prospect of a<br />\nconfrontation with the accused party at an honor trial<br />\nwould, they suggest, deter students from reporting<br />\nsuspected violations, thus reducing the effectiveness of<br />\nthe System.<br />\nThe System is conceived, however, as ideally being, presumably on the basis of principle,<br />\nself-enforc<br />\ning<br />\nnot convenience. The student who fails to report a<br />\nsuspected violation becomes an accessory to the fact and<br />\nis thereby also guilty under the System. That its effectiveness might be impaired would be due not to the proposed change, but a general lack of commitiment on the<br />\npart of the students.<br />\nFurthermore, according to the statistics revealed at<br />\nlast Sunday's open forum, an average of only twenty<br />\nviolations are reported each year, half of which result<br />\nin convictions. Although students submit half of the reports of suspected violations, only three of the ten on the<br />\naverage result in convictions, the other seven having been<br />\ninitiated on the part of the faculty.<br />\nThis proportion exists, we are told, because a faculty member usually is in a better poiston to judge if a<br />\nviolation has taken place. In any case, it should he painfully obvious that an average of twenty reported violations _implies there is a minimal committment to the<br />\nSystem as it stands. Even if a few students are deterred<br />\nby the prospect of facing the accused, the Honor System<br />\nwill hardly he dealt a serious blow.<br />\nThat there is a greater proportion of convictions<br />\nthis year to the same number of reported violations is<br />\nprobably one reason why the issue has been raised at<br />\nthis time, and all the more reason why the change should<br />\nbe carried out. The Honor Commission must afford the<br />\naccused every possible means to clear himself, and a confrontation with the accuser might clarify questions of<br />\nfact wich would otherwise he overlooked.<br />\nOpponents of the change also argue that when the<br />\naccuser faces the accused, there is an implicit moral<br />\njudgment on the accuser's part which is not present<br />\nunder the current procedure. If we accept, however, the<br />\nanalogy of the Honor System to the American legal system, we see that it is not really the individual who is<br />\nthe accuser, but the System through the agency of the<br />\nHonor Commission, more specifically the Commission<br />\nCounsel, who acts as proseutor. The trial panel serves<br />\nin the capacity of judge, while the so-called accuser is<br />\nactually a witness, though one who has also fulfilled a<br />\nconstructive duty under the Honor Code to report a<br />\nsuspected violation.<br />\nInasmuch as the Honor Commission Constitution<br />\ncurrently employs the terms \"accused\" and \"accuser,\" a<br />\nredefinition of this relationship along the lines stated<br />\nabove should be undertaken, regardless of the outcome<br />\nof the confrontation question. It should be noted in<br />\npassing that this redefinition was suggested by a nonCommission member at Sunday's forum, and was perhaps the most significant comment made at the meeting,<br />\nan indication in itself of the value of such gatherings.<br />\nJudging from the positions taken by Commission<br />\nmembers at the forum, the Commission seems to be<br />\nevenly divided over the proposed change. The issue<br />\nshould ultimately be resolved by a student referendum,<br />\nalthough we hope that the Commission will first make<br />\nfurther efforts to appraise students of the nature and<br />\nimplications of the proposal in question.<br />\n<br />\n1967<br />\n<br />\nBy ELIA KATZ<br />\nAll in all, I get the picture of<br />\nthe child of a used-car salesman,<br />\ncome back from college to taunt<br />\nand impress his father with his<br />\nmastery of the English language.<br />\nNot that I am not impressed, but<br />\nI am sure I would be more impressed if John Barth were a<br />\ncousin or brother or something,<br />\nfor his accomplishment is not so<br />\ninteresting as the fact of the accomplishment.<br />\nI suppose in time, (3 days, a<br />\nweek) Barth's work will go on<br />\nremainder at Marboro's, and<br />\nsimultaneously enter the Elite<br />\nCorpus of masterpieces, volumes<br />\nbound in leather on all six sides,<br />\nto be annotated without being<br />\nread.

The prospect of a<br />\nconfrontation with the accused party at an honor trial<br />\nwould, they suggest, deter students from reporting<br />\nsuspected violations, thus reducing the effectiveness of<br />\nthe System.<br />\nThe System is conceived, however, as ideally being, presumably on the basis of principle,<br />\nself-enforc<br />\ning<br />\nnot convenience. The student who fails to report a<br />\nsuspected violation becomes an accessory to the fact and<br />\nis thereby also guilty under the System. That its effectiveness might be impaired would be due not to the proposed change, but a general lack of commitiment on the<br />\npart of the students.<br />\nFurthermore, according to the statistics revealed at<br />\nlast Sunday's open forum, an average of only twenty<br />\nviolations are reported each year, half of which result<br />\nin convictions. Although students submit half of the reports of suspected violations, only three of the ten on the<br />\naverage result in convictions, the other seven having been<br />\ninitiated on the part of the faculty.<br />\nThis proportion exists, we are told, because a faculty member usually is in a better poiston to judge if a<br />\nviolation has taken place. In any case, it should he painfully obvious that an average of twenty reported violations _implies there is a minimal committment to the<br />\nSystem as it stands. Even if a few students are deterred<br />\nby the prospect of facing the accused, the Honor System<br />\nwill hardly he dealt a serious blow.<br />\nThat there is a greater proportion of convictions<br />\nthis year to the same number of reported violations is<br />\nprobably one reason why the issue has been raised at<br />\nthis time, and all the more reason why the change should<br />\nbe carried out. The Honor Commission must afford the<br />\naccused every possible means to clear himself, and a confrontation with the accuser might clarify questions of<br />\nfact wich would otherwise he overlooked.<br />\nOpponents of the change also argue that when the<br />\naccuser faces the accused, there is an implicit moral<br />\njudgment on the accuser's part which is not present<br />\nunder the current procedure. If we accept, however, the<br />\nanalogy of the Honor System to the American legal system, we see that it is not really the individual who is<br />\nthe accuser, but the System through the agency of the<br />\nHonor Commission, more specifically the Commission<br />\nCounsel, who acts as proseutor. The trial panel serves<br />\nin the capacity of judge, while the so-called accuser is<br />\nactually a witness, though one who has also fulfilled a<br />\nconstructive duty under the Honor Code to report a<br />\nsuspected violation.<br />\nInasmuch as the Honor Commission Constitution<br />\ncurrently employs the terms \"accused\" and \"accuser,\" a<br />\nredefinition of this relationship along the lines stated<br />\nabove should be undertaken, regardless of the outcome<br />\nof the confrontation question. It should be noted in<br />\npassing that this redefinition was suggested by a nonCommission member at Sunday's forum, and was perhaps the most significant comment made at the meeting,<br />\nan indication in itself of the value of such gatherings.<br />\nJudging from the positions taken by Commission<br />\nmembers at the forum, the Commission seems to be<br />\nevenly divided over the proposed change. The issue<br />\nshould ultimately be resolved by a student referendum,<br />\nalthough we hope that the Commission will first make<br />\nfurther efforts to appraise students of the nature and<br />\nimplications of the proposal in question.<br /><br />\n1967<br /><br />\nBy ELIA KATZ<br />\nAll in all, I get the picture of<br />\nthe child of a used-car salesman,<br />\ncome back from college to taunt<br />\nand impress his father with his<br />\nmastery of the English language.<br />\nNot that I am not impressed, but<br />\nI am sure I would be more impressed if John Barth were a<br />\ncousin or brother or something,<br />\nfor his accomplishment is not so<br />\ninteresting as the fact of the accomplishment.<br />\nI suppose in time, (3 days, a<br />\nweek) Barth's work will go on<br />\nremainder at Marboro's, and<br />\nsimultaneously enter the Elite<br />\nCorpus of masterpieces, volumes<br />\nbound in leather on all six sides,<br />\nto be annotated without being<br />\nread.
