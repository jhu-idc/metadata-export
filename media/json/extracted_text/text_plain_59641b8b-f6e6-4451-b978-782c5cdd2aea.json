The only question was<br />\nwhether the Association would meet<br />\nBrickley's terms.<br />\nAt the present time, if it were<br />\nonly a matter of terms, Brickley's<br />\nreturn would be assured. He asked<br />\nfor a substantial increase over the<br />\nsalary which he was given for his<br />\nwork of the past season, and this,<br />\nafter the advisers had recommended<br />\nthat it be given to him, was granted<br />\nat the meeting of the Association<br />\nheld December 6.<br />\nBrickley, however, refuses to give<br />\na definite answer until he has returned from his contemplated trip'<br />\nto New England. At the present<br />\ntime, he says, he himself is ignorant<br />\nof his future course of action. His<br />\ndecision witl probably not be received for ten days or two weeks.<br />\nRumors have been afloat recently<br />\nthat Brickley was to be offered a<br />\nposition on the coaching staff of<br />\nHarvard, which the leaving of<br />\nHaughton has somewhat disorganized. It has also been rumored that<br />\nBrickley has received advantageous<br />\nbusiness offers from Boston business houses, which would give him<br />\ntime to assist his alma mater during the football season.<br />\n. These offers would, of course,<br />\nbe very attractive to Brickley.<br />\nHowever, Hopkins rooters can find<br />\nconsolation in that as yet Brickley<br />\nhas in no way bound himself, and<br />\nthe fact that he is still considering<br />\nthe offer of the Athletic Association seems to attest that there are<br />\nexcellent chances of his being back<br />\nin his old position at Homewood<br />\nwhen next fall's football practice<br />\nbegins.<br />\n1917 Hullabaloo to Hold Benefits.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

The spirit<br />\nof the new era is upon us; now is<br />\nthe time to look forward at what<br />\nthe coming year has in store for us,<br />\nand to prepare to profit by its advantages, share its pleasures, meet<br />\nits misfortunes, and, in general, do<br />\neverything we possibly can toward<br />\nthe maintenance of the fair name of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nThe students of six of the \"Big<br />\nNine Universities\" have voted to<br />\nabolish the present rule against<br />\n\"summer baseball.\" The agitation<br />\nagainst this unpopular rule has become so noticeable that some action<br />\nwill undoubtedly be taken at the<br />\nnext meeting of the council.

French, of the collegiate<br />\nfaculty. The subject under consideration was that of \"Workmanship.\"<br />\nThe first service of the week was<br />\ndevoted to a discussion of workmanship in general, and in the subsequent meetings examples of great<br />\nworkers were given. The meetings<br />\nwere all well attended.<br />\nOn Wednesday, December 8, Dr.<br />\nJ. M. T. Finney delivered the latter<br />\nof his two lectures on the \"Fundamentals of Life.\" These talks have<br />\nappeared annually for several years<br />\npast in the schedule of lectures of<br />\nthe Association, and the students<br />\nhave always displayed a keen interest in them. The lectures this<br />\nyear were well attended. As has<br />\nbeen customary, the freshmen were<br />\nexcused from gymnasium work on<br />\nthe two afternoons, and, although<br />\nthe lectures are intended primarily<br />\nfor members of the Freshman<br />\nClass, many sophomores and upperclassmen were present.<br />\nDr. Finney spoke in the same<br />\nconcise and frank manner which has<br />\nplayed an important part in determining the popularity of his past<br />\nlectures.<br />\nMr. Robert E.

Furthermore, as<br />\nsoon as the freshmen gave up all<br />\nhope of getting their regular banner they made as good a one as they<br />\n<br />\nThe Fresh-Soph Affair from Another<br />\nPoint of View.<br />\n<br />\nClothes with \"pep\"<br />\nfor college men<br />\nHart Schaffner & Marx<br />\nSociety Brand<br />\nKuppenheimer<br />\nR. B. Fashion Clothes<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nSir\u2014Anyone who attended the<br />\nfreshman-sophomore football game<br />\nat Homewood on December 4 must<br />\nhave been struck by both- the remarkably small number of freshmen present and the conspicuous<br />\nabsence of any fitting or in any<br />\nway premeditated class banner.<br />\nThis is not a criticism of the<br />\nFreshman Class\u2014both its football<br />\nteam and the small number who<br />\nwere present to participate in the<br />\nclass rush made extremely good<br />\nshowings\u2014but a plea that the freshman classes of the future be informed of the customs of the interclass contests, and that these contests themselves receive a larger<br />\ndegree of University support.<br />\nThe inter-class rush, held on the<br />\nday of the freshman - sophomore<br />\ngame, is the only form of rivalry<br />\nin which all the members of both<br />\nclasses have a chance to participate.<br />\nAt the recent rush, however, the<br />\nfreshmen seemed to be in total ignorance of the time-honored custom of producing a banner for the<br />\nsophomores to demolish, and it was<br />\nonly after the taunts of the latter<br />\nand the solicitous advice of the<br />\nupper-classmen that a somewhat<br />\nscurvy makeshift was produced.<br />\nThe benefit to the freshmen of.<br />\nthe rush with the sophomores does<br />\nnot consist in having a piece of<br />\npainted silk\u2014or canvas\u2014torn into<br />\nminute shreds; it consists in giving them a feeling of class unity.<br />\nIt is a wellknown fact that the universities which have keen interclass rivalry generally have welldeveloped college spirit, but even<br />\nwithout this direct corollary any<br />\nactivity which draws together the<br />\nnew members of the University<br />\nshould be heartily encouraged.<br />\nThe rather shameful exhibition<br />\nof two weeks ago was certainly not<br />\nthe fault of the sophomores\u2014they<br />\nwere probably as disappointed at<br />\nthe lack of freshmen as were the<br />\nfreshmen themselves; nbr can it<br />\nbe said to have been the fault of<br />\nthe freshmen. It was the fault of<br />\nthe want of interest in the event<br />\nmanifested throughout the University, and of the failure of the upperclassmen to inform the ireshinen Of<br />\nwhat was expected of them. What<br />\nseems to have been needed in the<br />\nwhole affair is what is commonly<br />\ndesignated by the expression \"a<br />\nHORATIUS.<br />\nlittle more pep.\"<br />\nDecember 8, 1915.<br />\n<br />\nllie<br />\n<br />\nhub<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore Street at Charles<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!

The only question was<br />\nwhether the Association would meet<br />\nBrickley's terms.<br />\nAt the present time, if it were<br />\nonly a matter of terms, Brickley's<br />\nreturn would be assured. He asked<br />\nfor a substantial increase over the<br />\nsalary which he was given for his<br />\nwork of the past season, and this,<br />\nafter the advisers had recommended<br />\nthat it be given to him, was granted<br />\nat the meeting of the Association<br />\nheld December 6.<br />\nBrickley, however, refuses to give<br />\na definite answer until he has returned from his contemplated trip'<br />\nto New England. At the present<br />\ntime, he says, he himself is ignorant<br />\nof his future course of action.

It has also been rumored that<br />\nBrickley has received advantageous<br />\nbusiness offers from Boston business houses, which would give him<br />\ntime to assist his alma mater during the football season.<br />\n. These offers would, of course,<br />\nbe very attractive to Brickley.<br />\nHowever, Hopkins rooters can find<br />\nconsolation in that as yet Brickley<br />\nhas in no way bound himself, and<br />\nthe fact that he is still considering<br />\nthe offer of the Athletic Association seems to attest that there are<br />\nexcellent chances of his being back<br />\nin his old position at Homewood<br />\nwhen next fall's football practice<br />\nbegins.<br />\n1917 Hullabaloo to Hold Benefits.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

A new era for<br />\nthe entire University was heralded<br />\nat the dedication of the new buildings at Homewood, and the inauguration of Dr. Prank Johnson Goodnow as the third executive; matters<br />\nattendant upon the removal of the<br />\nUniversity have brought forth many<br />\ninnovations in the handling of the<br />\nseveral departments of reference;<br />\ngeneral preparations for taking up<br />\nthe new quarters have been cause<br />\nfor much interest and comment.<br />\nThe year 1915 marks the resignation of former Dean Edward H.<br />\nGriffin and the selection of Dean<br />\nMurray P.

Spirit in<br />\nthe undertaking of matters purely<br />\nunder student control has probably<br />\nnever been more healthy.<br />\nLooking back over the successes,<br />\ntrials and triumphs of the past year<br />\nwe can find much to encourage us<br />\nto make the next year even more<br />\nsignificant in the history of the<br />\nUniversity. There is much yet to<br />\nbe accomplished along all lines, and<br />\nthe year 1916 offers a splendid time<br />\nin which to do the work. The spirit<br />\nof the new era is upon us; now is<br />\nthe time to look forward at what<br />\nthe coming year has in store for us,<br />\nand to prepare to profit by its advantages, share its pleasures, meet<br />\nits misfortunes, and, in general, do<br />\neverything we possibly can toward<br />\nthe maintenance of the fair name of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nThe students of six of the \"Big<br />\nNine Universities\" have voted to<br />\nabolish the present rule against<br />\n\"summer baseball.\" The agitation<br />\nagainst this unpopular rule has become so noticeable that some action<br />\nwill undoubtedly be taken at the<br />\nnext meeting of the council.

French, of the collegiate<br />\nfaculty. The subject under consideration was that of \"Workmanship.\"<br />\nThe first service of the week was<br />\ndevoted to a discussion of workmanship in general, and in the subsequent meetings examples of great<br />\nworkers were given. The meetings<br />\nwere all well attended.<br />\nOn Wednesday, December 8, Dr.<br />\nJ. M. T. Finney delivered the latter<br />\nof his two lectures on the \"Fundamentals of Life.\" These talks have<br />\nappeared annually for several years<br />\npast in the schedule of lectures of<br />\nthe Association, and the students<br />\nhave always displayed a keen interest in them. The lectures this<br />\nyear were well attended. As has<br />\nbeen customary, the freshmen were<br />\nexcused from gymnasium work on<br />\nthe two afternoons, and, although<br />\nthe lectures are intended primarily<br />\nfor members of the Freshman<br />\nClass, many sophomores and upperclassmen were present.<br />\nDr. Finney spoke in the same<br />\nconcise and frank manner which has<br />\nplayed an important part in determining the popularity of his past<br />\nlectures.<br />\nMr. Robert E. F. Aler, of the<br />\nClass of 1916, has been appointed<br />\nto fill the vacancy caused by the<br />\nresignation of Mr. John C. Branham as assistant general secretary<br />\nof the Association. Mr. Aler is particularly well qualified for the position, having had much experience<br />\nin handling the work of the Young<br />\nMen's Christian Association from<br />\nthe standpoint of an officer.<br />\nThere will be no chapel services<br />\nthis week on account of the proximity of the Christmas examinations, which begin on Friday.

However, the<br />\nexperiments carried on . here in<br />\nthe University have clearly indicated that evolution is extremely<br />\ngradual.<br />\nDr. Jennings' investigations, as<br />\nrevealed in his article to the National Scientific Society, are farreaching in their effect, for with the<br />\nestablishment of the fact that evolution in lower organisms is gradual<br />\nmany of the theories held up to<br />\nthe present time will be entirel<br />\nchanged.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nMAIL BAG OVERFLOW<br />\nMr. Hollyday Thanks Ushers.<br /><br />\nTnE NEws-LErrER:<br />\nSir\u2014On behalf of the Board of<br />\nDirectors of the Maryland League<br />\nfor National Defense, I wish to sincerely thank the Hopkins undergraduates who offered their services<br />\nas ushers at the mass-meeting on<br />\nthe evening of Saturday, December 4.<br />\nThe efficient handling of the<br />\ncrowd on that night added mater'ally to the success of the meeting.<br />\nIn view of the enthusiastic suf.<br />\nport accorded the undertaking, it is<br />\nlikely that the Board of Directors<br />\nwill authorize a similar meeting<br />\nnext month, and it is hoped that<br />\nthe services of those who volunteered on \"Defense Day\" may be<br />\nrelied upon at that meeting.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nGUY T. 0.

We have so<br />\nfew\u2014so very few\u2014traditions at<br />\nHopkins, such a pitiably small<br />\nnumber of things that go to make<br />\nan under-classman realize that he<br />\nis a freshman or sophomore, not<br />\nmerely an amiable young man of<br />\npraiseworthy aims and moral integrity, that any attempt to decrease<br />\nthe number should be greeted with<br />\na speedy and official frown. No<br />\nmere sheep-skin diploma can suffice<br />\nto put the university stamp on graduates who have thought of their<br />\nclass as only an accidental grouping<br />\nof young men united in the pursuit<br />\nof Chaucer or the elusive molecule.<br />\nThere is such a thing as class spirit<br />\nand class unity that are as important<br />\nas any lecture or any quizz in any<br />\ncourse in the curriculum. This fact<br />\nthe freshmen seem to have overlooked.<br />\nThe introduction of the burlap<br />\nmakeshift with the painted numerals was a praiseworthy attempt to<br />\natone for the earlier error of omission. But it is hardly fair to ask<br />\na large and healthy crowd of sophomores to confine their destructive<br />\ntendencies to the rending limb from<br />\nlimb of a potato sack.
