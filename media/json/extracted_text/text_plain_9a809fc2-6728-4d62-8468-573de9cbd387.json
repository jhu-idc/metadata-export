And, do you remember the<br />\nscore in 1922 of Hopkins 16, St. John's 7, and in 1923 Hopkins 3, St.<br />\nJohn's 0? These three victories, all within the experience of the<br />\npresent Senior Class, are sufficient examples to demonstrate the athletic superiority of Johns Hopkins over St. John's. There is little<br />\ndoubt that this year Captain Magill will engage in a victorious game<br />\nover St. John's for the fourth time during his college career.<br />\nBut, do you remember that always in the past St. John's has<br />\nbeen primed for the Hopkins contest? Do you remember that, no<br />\nmatter what comparative scores have indicated, the contest has al..<br />\nwaysbeen close? This year, when Hopkins and St. John's meet for<br />\nthe thirty-seventh time, will be no exception. And, do you remember how rooting and celebration have been helpful to the team in<br />\nthe past? Yet, good sportsmanship has always characterized the<br />\ngame. Do you remember the traditional bonfires and parades which<br />\nhave lent distinction to a Hopkins-St. John's game? And the snake<br />\ndance after victory? A Hopkins-St. John's clash without symptoms<br />\nof the \"St. John's fever\" would be remarkable.<br />\nLet's make a bonfire that will illustrate to some extent the<br />\nwarmth of the reception St. John's will receive at the Stadium on<br />\nSaturday. But, let us remember at all times that parades, bonfires,<br />\nor any celebrations are Hopkins activities, the participants Hopkins<br />\nmen, and that Hopkins will be judged by our actions on these occasions.<br />\n<br />\nWe haven't had any pep meetings or yell practice for some time.<br />\nBefore the St. John's game is a good time to arouse a little pep.<br />\n<br />\nBETTING<br />\nThe Student Council and the Athletic Association have requested again that the students refrain from offering or accepting bets on<br />\nathletic contests in which Hopkins team participate.

And, do you remember the<br />\nscore in 1922 of Hopkins 16, St. John's 7, and in 1923 Hopkins 3, St.<br />\nJohn's 0? These three victories, all within the experience of the<br />\npresent Senior Class, are sufficient examples to demonstrate the athletic superiority of Johns Hopkins over St. John's. There is little<br />\ndoubt that this year Captain Magill will engage in a victorious game<br />\nover St. John's for the fourth time during his college career.<br />\nBut, do you remember that always in the past St. John's has<br />\nbeen primed for the Hopkins contest? Do you remember that, no<br />\nmatter what comparative scores have indicated, the contest has al..<br />\nwaysbeen close? This year, when Hopkins and St. John's meet for<br />\nthe thirty-seventh time, will be no exception. And, do you remember how rooting and celebration have been helpful to the team in<br />\nthe past? Yet, good sportsmanship has always characterized the<br />\ngame. Do you remember the traditional bonfires and parades which<br />\nhave lent distinction to a Hopkins-St. John's game? And the snake<br />\ndance after victory? A Hopkins-St. John's clash without symptoms<br />\nof the \"St. John's fever\" would be remarkable.<br />\nLet's make a bonfire that will illustrate to some extent the<br />\nwarmth of the reception St. John's will receive at the Stadium on<br />\nSaturday.
