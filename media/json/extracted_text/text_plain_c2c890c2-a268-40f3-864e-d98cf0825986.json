The NEWS-LETTER, however, holds no such unqualitied view.<br />\nThere is, of course, much to be said in favor of the struggle.<br />\nIt marked the beginning of that group-consciousness, known on<br />\nthe campus as \"class spirit,\" which after it has developed from<br />\nits present hazy and indistinct shape, will be the standard by<br />\nwhich the success or failure will ultimately be judged. Also,<br />\nthe self respect of the harassed frosh must be materially increased<br />\nby the knowledge that they have at last registered a more than<br />\npassive disapproval of their lot by engaging in combat with their<br />\ntormenters.<br />\nThis question of class fights, in common with any other problem, has two sides. Last Friday's battle, for instance, was pointless. It was organized by upperclassmen for their own amusement. In that respect it proved highly satisfactory; whether it<br />\noffered equal advantages to the participants is a debatable question. No freshman can truthfully say what he was fighting for<br />\nor why, neither could any sophomore; thus the battle dragged<br />\non endlessly. The fact that one student was rather seriously<br />\nshaken up did not serve to help the situation.<br />\nAs usual we counsel moderation. When the Pep Committee exceeds its powers and tries to exact more than compliance<br />\nwith regulations, every freshman may fight as hard as he pleases<br />\nwith the blessings of the NEWS-LETTER on his head. In other<br />\ncases, unless the individual has an inborn lust for bloodshed, we<br />\ntdvise him to avoid trouble.<br />\n<br />\nWHY THE NEGLECT<br />\nThe required two weeks have rolled around, but as yet<br />\nthe most valuable of the regulations have not been enforced.<br />\nNo move has been made toward giving out activities buttons<br />\nor enforcing the rule that every freshman must be out for at<br />\nleast one activity.<br />\nIt is time for the Pep Committee, which has been enthusiastically enforcing all the other regulations and doing a little<br />\naimless paddling on the side, to really get to work and attend to<br />\nits most important task.

We realize that this<br />\nwould be very amusing if permitted, but also that eventually some<br />\nbright upperclassman would time one of the crossings and competition would immediately begin, finally resulting with some exceptional record being made. But here is on what we base our<br />\nrequest. With a plentiful amount of grease in the kitchen, the<br />\nBarn and sundry bathing suits with Gertrude Ederle's signature<br />\nattached on the campus, we feel quite certain that Miss Betty<br />\nwould consider it her duty to duplicate Miss Ederle's accomplishment and would break all records, thus bringing more humil-<br />\n<br />\niation on the already weakening stronger sex.<br />\nAlthough Jesse Hawley's eleven<br />\nscored twenty first downs against<br />\nthree for the Virginians, Dartmouth<br />\nback with a dash and display of Tech opened up a running attael'<br />\nwas unable to break through the<br />\nstrength in the last two periods which completely baffled Tulaue<br />\nSoutherners' defense at the critical<br />\nwhich caused the spectators to re- and scored a touchdown early 111<br />\nmoments.<br />\ncall the brilliant Notre Dame team the final quarter, and went into the<br />\nof 1924, whi6h contained the famous lead a few minutes later when the<br />\npoint after touchdown was made bY<br />\n\"Four Horsemen.\"<br />\nLane, fleet-footed Dartmouth<br />\na<br />\nCoach Knute Rockne, of Notre drop kick.

The NEWS-LETTER, however, holds no such unqualitied view.<br />\nThere is, of course, much to be said in favor of the struggle.<br />\nIt marked the beginning of that group-consciousness, known on<br />\nthe campus as \"class spirit,\" which after it has developed from<br />\nits present hazy and indistinct shape, will be the standard by<br />\nwhich the success or failure will ultimately be judged. Also,<br />\nthe self respect of the harassed frosh must be materially increased<br />\nby the knowledge that they have at last registered a more than<br />\npassive disapproval of their lot by engaging in combat with their<br />\ntormenters.<br />\nThis question of class fights, in common with any other problem, has two sides. Last Friday's battle, for instance, was pointless. It was organized by upperclassmen for their own amusement. In that respect it proved highly satisfactory; whether it<br />\noffered equal advantages to the participants is a debatable question. No freshman can truthfully say what he was fighting for<br />\nor why, neither could any sophomore; thus the battle dragged<br />\non endlessly. The fact that one student was rather seriously<br />\nshaken up did not serve to help the situation.<br />\nAs usual we counsel moderation. When the Pep Committee exceeds its powers and tries to exact more than compliance<br />\nwith regulations, every freshman may fight as hard as he pleases<br />\nwith the blessings of the NEWS-LETTER on his head. In other<br />\ncases, unless the individual has an inborn lust for bloodshed, we<br />\ntdvise him to avoid trouble.<br /><br />\nWHY THE NEGLECT<br />\nThe required two weeks have rolled around, but as yet<br />\nthe most valuable of the regulations have not been enforced.<br />\nNo move has been made toward giving out activities buttons<br />\nor enforcing the rule that every freshman must be out for at<br />\nleast one activity.<br />\nIt is time for the Pep Committee, which has been enthusiastically enforcing all the other regulations and doing a little<br />\naimless paddling on the side, to really get to work and attend to<br />\nits most important task.
