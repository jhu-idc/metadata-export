Discussion on the measure took up the entire<br />\nmorning session. The final vote was 42 to 15<br />\nfor expulsion, from both the convention delegates and the 'National Executive Committeemen.<br />\nThe meeting, one of four that NUC has each<br />\nyear, was closed to all except NUC members,<br />\nincluding the press. It attracted around 175<br />\nmembers, mainly from the east coast. Following<br />\nthe expulsions, credentials of those entering the<br />\nmeeting were checked to exclude anyone affiliated with the banned organizations.<br />\nOld-Line Politics<br />\nThe move for expulsion, which had the<br />\nbacking of the national leadership, was prompted<br />\nby what proponents of the measure called<br />\nPLP's and WSA's \"obstructionist\" tactics. The<br />\norganizations were accused of having set \"oldline\" politics which interfered with the development of NUC's ideology.<br />\nNUC claimed that PLP's ideology was firmly<br />\nset. This led, it was claimed, to non-compromising positions on the part of members of PLP<br />\nand WSA, which resulted in obstructions to any<br />\nmeasure which these organizations opposed. A<br />\n<br />\nDean Pappas represented the Baltimore Defense Committee at the conference.<br />\nphoto<br />\nby andersott<br />\n<br />\nsimilar split occured in the Students for a Democratic Society at their national convention last<br />\nsummer.<br />\nThe final vote for expulsion took place around<br />\nnoon on Saturday. Following a plea for continuing action despite the divisions, the meeting<br />\nadjourned to another room. Security guards<br />\nwere placed at the door of this room (Shaffer 3)<br />\nin order to keep members of PLP or WSA from<br />\nentering.<br />\nThe banned members then held a caucus in the<br />\noriginal meeting room. They were hoping to<br />\nmeet with the main body of NUC later that<br />\nafternoon and present some sort of proposal.<br />\nNUC, however, rejected the request for a meeting.<br />\nLet Them Eat<br />\nThe PLP and WSA members were allowed to<br />\neat the meals which they had paid for with<br />\ntheir registration fee; however separate tables<br />\nwere provided, away from the meeting room.<br />\nTim Stocks,an NUC member who was excluded,<br />\nstated that \"It was clear that the Nationals<br />\ndidn't want the NUC members talking to the<br />\nPLP and WSA people.\" A party held that night<br />\nat the home of Paul Lauter was declared closed<br />\nto the expelled members.<br />\nThe excluded group then prepared a four page<br />\nstatement which they presented to the organization on Sunday morning. In this they stated that<br />\n\"NUC should strive to become a mass organization.\"<br />\nThe reconvened session of the convention featured a panel discussion on \"Class struggle and<br />\nRevolution,\" with the presentation of three<br />\nposition papers. These were given by Terry<br />\nRubinski, Paul Clauter and Bob Ross.<br />\nMiss Rubinski stated that she was for a revolution, which she defined as \"the overthrow of<br />\nthe capitalistic system by violence.\" She went<br />\non to say that \"When the poor steal from the<br />\nrich they go to jail, but when the rich steal<br />\nfrom the poor they go to the bank.\"<br />\nClauter, who is from the University of Indiana,<br />\nstated that \"The Cultural Revolution is just a<br />\nmess, but a very nice mess.\" His statement<br />\n\"Mao and Lenin don't know what the fuck is<br />\ngoing on in America today,\" received mixed<br />\nresponse.<br />\nBob Ross presented the third paper. He began<br />\nby saying \"We are now in Act II of the 1970<br />\nIce Capades,\" and continued, pointing out that<br />\nthe NUC \"should defend the Black Revolutionaries, but their- position should not be our<br />\nown.\"<br />\nOn and On<br />\nThe convention continued with workshops<br />\nSaturday afternoon, a mass meeting panel discussion on organization Saturday night, and<br />\nfurther discussion of specific organizational<br />\nchanges on Sunday.<br />\nMike Ornstein, a member of the Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nMichael Ornstein of Hopkins N.U.C. refused to divulge any of the proceedings at the national meetphoto by !emit:<br />\ning on campus.<br />\n<br />\nchapter of NUC, refused to. comment on<br />\nAny aspects of the convention due to the press<br />\nblackout. After a decision which was made on<br />\n\"a national_ executive level,\" Ornstein offered<br />\nthe News-Letter an exclusive on NUC's forthcoming press release in return for not publishing<br />\nthis article.<br />\nLauter also requested that the News-Letter<br />\nrefrain from publishing \"in the interest of<br />\nclarity.- The News-Letter was able to have a<br />\nreporter present at most of the proceedings.<br />\nSaturday's night meeting was mainly concerned with a proposal by historian Staughton<br />\nLynd to organize protests by stock holders at<br />\ntheir company's meetings. This would be aimed<br />\nspecifically at companies involved in weapon<br />\nproduction. No final action was taken on the<br />\nmeasure.<br />\nA group of delegates brought up the question<br />\nof the morning expulsions at this meeting. The<br />\nnational leaders responded by discussing the<br />\nnumber of times they had received calls from<br />\nchapters with \"PL trouble.\"<br />\nThe expelled members claim that the charges<br />\nagainst them are vague, and that their opponents<br />\nhave not brought out any specific examples of<br />\nobstructionism. They further charged that the<br />\nentire resolution was railroaded through, pointing out that all but one of the executive<br />\ncommittee members voted for expulsion.<br />\nWe Try Harder<br />\nAlso claimed against the expelled members<br />\nwas that NUC came second in their loyalties.<br />\nPLP members answered that charge by pointing<br />\nout that members of the Women's Liberation<br />\nFront and the International Socialists are still in<br />\nNUC -despite their conflicting loyalties.<br />\nLocal NUC members John Ferchak and Mary<br />\nKennedy supported the move, Ferchak calling<br />\nit \"basically necessary\" and Kennedy saying she<br />\nwas \"glad it happened.\" The NUC situation was<br />\ncompared to that that faced SDS when they<br />\nexpelled PLP.

Harrold<br />\nCarswell to the Supreme Court, there<br />\nwas little surprise in Washington. It<br />\nwas, after all, Mr. Nixon who selected<br />\nChief Justice Burger last fall and Spiro<br />\nAgnew a little over a year ago. These<br />\nappointments have been interpreted in a<br />\nvariety of ways; that the President is<br />\nseeking to placate the South; that he<br />\ndesires to restore a \"balance\" to American governmental philosophy; or, most<br />\ncredibly, that the President favors quiet<br />\nmediocrity.<br />\nNone of the men Mr. Nixon has picked<br />\nto run the government vary from what<br />\nthe President has termed \"the conventional values of American life.\" So it<br />\nwas little surprise which greeted the<br />\nCarswell appointment. The judge is noted<br />\nonly for the fact that his outlook, lifestyle and qualifications are much more<br />\nnarrow than those of any previous Nixon<br />\nappointee. The judge has never accepted<br />\nan off-the-bench job, does not own stock<br />\nIn any companies and the only organizations he can claim membership in are<br />\nthe American Foreign Legion and the<br />\nVeterans of Foreign Wars. He is, as<br />\nattorney General Mitchel said of Haynsworth, as \"clean as a hound's tooth.\"<br />\n<br />\nSPECIAL<br />\nNOTICE<br />\nStudent<br />\nand<br />\nFaculty<br />\nDiscounts<br />\n<br />\nMr. Nixon's immediate Republican<br />\npredecessor, who is often and erroneously deemed a man of little accomplishment, selected men of a different<br />\nquality than Judges Carswell and Burger<br />\naltogether. They were Wall Street, Ivy<br />\nLeague and regarded as wise choices<br />\nfor the high court. Though Mr. Eisenhower wished them to pursue a conservative course, they, like many that reach<br />\nthe Court, changed considerably. Earl<br />\nWarren was the best example, however,<br />\nof a man who could adapt his philosophy<br />\nto the requirements of individual liberty<br />\nin the cases that faced him. When he<br />\nwas governor of California Justice Warren had one of the worst records in the<br />\nnation on the rights of criminals or other<br />\ncivil liberties. In his case, however, and<br />\nthose like his, it has been the essential<br />\nquality of the man that has provided<br />\nthe necessary change.<br />\n<br />\nEpitome of Mediocrity<br />\nJudge Carswell is the epitome of<br />\nmediocrity. He is a veteran and alumnus<br />\nof Duke University where he was secretary of his class. He lost a race for<br />\nthe Georgia Legislature and moved to<br />\nTallahassee.

This the kind way of interpreting his 1948 speech in which he<br />\nsaid that he was a white supremist and<br />\nbelieved the white race to be superior<br />\nto all others. The judge said in his<br />\nSenate Judiciary testimony that he found<br />\nhis very words repugnant and repudiated<br />\nthem unequivocally. The words themselves mean very little but to amplify<br />\nthe extremely narrow life that our next<br />\nSupreme Court Justice has lead. It is<br />\nInteresting to note, for instance, that<br />\nthe judge did not find his white supremacy oratory repugnant when he joined a<br />\ncountry club in 1956 which incorporated<br />\na public golf course threatened with<br />\ndesegregation. More than half his civil<br />\nrights decisions have been overturned<br />\nby higher courts. John Lowenthal, a<br />\nRutgers professor who was once a civil<br />\nrights attorney in Carwells Tallahassee<br />\ncourt, testified before the senate committee that he found the judge openly<br />\nhostile when he once tried to free sev-<br />\n<br />\nFull line of<br />\n4-wheel drive<br />\nwork and play<br />\nvehicles.<br />\n6 OR V8<br />\nrtn,<br />\nWAGONEER<br />\nGLADIATOR<br />\n4 OR V6<br />\nUNIVERSAL<br />\nEXCITING 'REPSTER' SERIES!<br />\nTAKE A TEST DRIVE TODAY!<br />\n<br />\nSALES\u2022SERVICE\u2022 PARTS<br />\n<br />\nauto repairs<br />\nBrakes<br />\nAlignment<br />\nTune-Up<br />\nGrease & Oil Change<br />\nShock Absorbers<br />\nMufflers<br />\nAnti-Freeze<br />\nWheels<br />\n<br />\n:5Y<br />\n<br />\n.HONE-Y-/<br />\n<br />\nfRig'S tir(<br />\n1\\leNig<br />\nSU%<br />\n<br />\nAfter the Haynsworth struggle, there<br />\nis little doubt that G.

Mr. Nixon has said many times<br />\nthat he is tired of the many arrogant<br />\nand strong men that have sat on the<br />\ncourt in the last too decades who have<br />\n\"imposed their social and political viewpoints on the American people.\" Mr.<br />\nNixon wants a court that will move<br />\nslower and not grab the initiative in<br />\nchanging the often backward legal opinion<br />\nin the United States.

Peter Hughes<br />\nJed Kirschbaum<br />\n<br />\nNow, to the President...<br />\nThe Discipline Code released recently by the Committee<br />\non Student Affairs is a far more acceptable document than<br />\nthat proposed by Lincoln Gordon during orientation week.<br />\nThe Committee's draft of the policy allows for far greater<br />\nstudent participation in the disciplinary process.<br />\nBecause of the responsibility which the \" Committee<br />\nvests in the students, there is a great danger that the draft<br />\nwill be vetoed or watered down by President Gordon. Dr.<br />\nGordon has been a strong proponent of the Committee<br />\nSystem as it is presently constituted at Homewood. Should<br />\nhe appreciably alter the C.S.A.'s, he will undercut his<br />\nprofessed attitude toward the system which he has so<br />\nstrongly \"supported.\" \u2022 There are two sections of the Student Affairs statement<br />\nwhich the President might choose to alter. The first is the<br />\nelimination of expulsion as a disciplinary action. The other<br />\nis the composition of the review board. These were the<br />\nsections about which .the President expressed the most<br />\nconcern, when he met with the Committee in November.<br />\nThe Committee decided to drop the possibility of a student being expelled for several valid reasons. Their most<br />\npersuasive explanation was that the expulsion penalty<br />\nleaves no possibility for rehabilitation or the \"possibility<br />\nof social education.\"<br />\nThe composition of the review board presented by the<br />\ncommittee provides for mature participation in decisionmaking processes by all segments of the University _community. Principles of judicial action justify the plan for<br />\nstudents to outweigh faculty and administration on the<br />\nreview board. Students are the only group which will be<br />\nsubject to the discipline policy. It is logical that the review<br />\nboard be comprised overwhelmingly of the appellants'<br />\npeers. The anomaly inherent in the Committee plan is not<br />\nthat students are in the majority on the review board, but<br />\nthat faculty and administrators are represented at all. The<br />\ncase of the administration member is particularly strange,<br />\nsince it is the administration which will be bringing the<br />\ncharges against the student.<br />\nThe inclusion of two faculty members and one administrator on the review board appears to be an appeasement<br />\nmeasure. It shows a measure of distrust in students which<br />\nis characteristic of Hopkins.<br />\nNevertheless, the inclusion of the faculty and administration members does not compromise the Committee's<br />\ndraft of the discipline code significantly. On the whole, it<br />\nis a good measure, and we strongly urge that it be adopted<br />\nin its present form. We further urge that students register '<br />\ntheir support of this draft with their representatives, faculty<br />\nmembers with whom they speak and Dr. Gordon (should<br />\nthey happen to see him). Strong student support for this<br />\nmeasure can insure that it is not returned to its previous,<br />\nunacceptable form.<br />\n<br />\nThe final decision as to which buildings will actually<br />\nbe constructed will emerge from an administration,<br />\nfaculty and student consensus, according to McElwee,<br />\nalthough he did not elaborate on how such a consensus will be determined.' Newsletter, January 30<br />\nBoy, am I glad that we're going to have a consensus on the Master Plan. I really and truly am<br />\nglad, because the only alternative to a consensus<br />\nthat I can think of is violent revolution.(You want<br />\nto help blow up the admin building? We got this plan<br />\nin the history of art department, see...)So when<br />\nI read that article about the plan in Friday's News\u2014<br />\nLetter, I decided that McElwee is right. (John<br />\nMcElwee, in case you missed the article,is secretary of the Buildings and Grounds Committee for<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, and he has a plan to 'relieve the present bottlenecks in the parking and<br />\nbuilding facilities on campus.' It is quite a plan.<br />\nAnyway, I was lying on my bed sucking my thumb<br />\n- because if you have any opinions whatsoever<br />\nabout what is and what is not good architecture,<br />\nthe model of the proposed new buildings that was<br />\nshown in the Newsletter article sends you in shock.<br />\n- and thinking that the only bottleneck I'd like to<br />\nbreak is you-know -who's, when it dawned on me<br />\nthat Mr. McElwee had said something really deep<br />\nand true and worth thinking about. I mean, we<br />\nreally do need consensus if we're going to save<br />\npeople like me from doing terrible things to people like Mr. McElwee. And so I'd like to take a<br />\nfirst step toward achieving that devoutly-to-bedesired consensus, by telling the world what I<br />\nthink of the Master Plan, and maybe achieving a<br />\nlittle consensus along the way, among the student<br />\nbody. Not that we count.<br />\nWell, to begin with, I hope that I won't alienate<br />\nanyone when I say quite candidly that I think the<br />\nMaster Plan stinks. Because, if that bothers you,<br />\nyou aren't going to like at all what I have to say<br />\nnext. I think the Master Plan was drawn up by Spiro<br />\nAgnew and the Zenith City Chamber of Commerce,<br />\nwith the professional consultation of the militaryindustrial sleaze and a general disregard for human needs? Certainly not those cultivated old<br />\nMaryland aristocrats who comprise our Board of<br />\nTrustees? Or did I detect the emergence of a conflict between the sources of power and the sources<br />\nof taste along about - say - 1850? Such impressions<br />\nare so subtle and difficult to assess.<br />\nOh, it had to be the Zenith City Chamber of Com merce. Who else would dare to hire the architects<br />\nwho designed the new administration building.If we<br />\nare in this world of darkness and confusion to<br />\nacheive a consensus on anything, it should be on<br />\nthe fact the administration building is an unspeakable aesthetic disaster. I mean,do you realize that<br />\nit is going to have a mansard roof? We of course<br />\nunderstand that the elephant pits around the building exist just in case it should ever have to be defended, but why at the top that fond glance back to<br />\nthe Second Empire?<br />\nBut why speculate further? It is perfectly obvious that the architect - if that building has an<br />\narchitect - likes to build ugly buildings. And whoever does the hiring and firing around here likes<br />\n<br />\nto employ incompetent architects. We have already the Eisenhower Library and Shaffer Hall<br />\nto inform us of that. (A friend of mine labeled<br />\nthe style of the Library 'Mussolini Modern' and<br />\nShaffer clearly was designed by someone with<br />\nlong experience in the field of public housing.)<br />\nPerhaps, though, I am taking the wrong tack.<br />\nYou, you cute little electrical engineering major,<br />\nare probably wild about the library (and if you<br />\nlike the library, you're gonna go apeshit over the<br />\nadmin building). It may be that aesthetic considerations must remain the concern of a dissatisfied cadre of efete snobs buried on B level<br />\nof the Libes. What we're searching for is consensus, and so let's talk about a matter that is<br />\nnear and dear to the heart of everyone; do you<br />\nknow that the Buildings and Grounds Committee<br />\nwants to put up a parking garage on the southwest<br />\ncorner of the campus, and that this $2,500,000<br />\nbeauty has priority over a student union? Get you<br />\nwhere you live?<br />\nI mean, isn't. it typical? On the national level,<br />\nwe gotta get the Viet Cong first, and then if there's<br />\nanything left over, we fight the war on poverty,<br />\nright? And here at JHU,we provide shelter for the<br />\ncars, and if there's anything left over, maybe -just maybe --we can have something that you and<br />\nI can enjoy. Let me take back that remark about the<br />\nZenith City Chamber of Commerce.The committee<br />\nthat makes up priorities is composed of a Kharmann-Ghia, two Volkswagens and a Chevy Nova.<br />\nFurthermore, McElwee wants to tear down part<br />\nof Wyman Park(that's trees, people)and replace it<br />\nwith concrete.Trees, beauty, human scale, natural<br />\nresources, human resources: they all go, just so<br />\nthe fucking cars can have a place to park. The<br />\ntennis courts went for the admin building. Now the<br />\npark is to go for the parking garage. (I'd like to<br />\nkill a car. I'd like to take a knife and slit its drive<br />\nshaft from ear to ear. And smother its carburator,<br />\nand rip open its gas tank and let its guts slither to<br />\nthe ground. That's what I'd like to do to a car. And<br />\nthen I'd go down to the police station and turn myself in and they could do anything theyw anted to me,<br />\nand it wouldn't matter, because I'd be a happy<br />\nhumanoi(1.)<br />\nSo, there, McElwee, makes a consensus out of<br />\nthat. If you want a consensus with people, how<br />\nabout thinking about the things that people need!<br />\nIf you want a consensus with people, you've got to<br />\ntake our needs into consideration. You've just got<br />\nto! People want places to live and work and play<br />\nand talk together, which is what you can't do in a<br />\nparking garage. And they want beauty and ease of<br />\ngetting around (on foot) and some places where<br />\ntheir feet touch ground instead of concrete. And<br />\nthis place could be like that. It could be so everlovingly nice to live and work on the Johns Hopkins campus if people like you would just stop to<br />\nthink of what humans want, and then help us to<br />\nget it.<br />\nAnd instead, you build parking garages. I hope<br />\nyou drown in your own exhaust fumes.<br />\n<br />\nSam Logan<br />\n<br />\n1-1,<br />\n<br />\nWE/vE<br />\n<br />\nCAN4rTAKE ANOTHER'<br />\nFARTHINb<br />\nTAXATION!<br />\n<br />\nHI<br />\ni1ll(11ilfELI<br />\nC Fteld EnUrpr....<br />\n<br />\n1970<br />\n<br />\nW4EN1,120 YOU<br />\nl-FT THE PFA5ANTs<br />\n<br />\nQ<br />\n<br />\n71CTATE To You?<br />\n<br />\nTHE WIZARD OF ID<br />\n<br />\n7-3:PuEEFA<br />\n,Y15<br />\n7<br />\n/A<br />\nR:N.:<br />\nT.<br />\nT<br />\n1 4\u00b05<br />\n,<br />\n7-yizE<br />\n-THE 'oye4i.-VAULT KEEPER',<br />\n<br />\n\fFeb. 3, 1970<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The<br />\nEditors<br />\nGOVERNANCE<br />\nTo the Editors;<br />\nThat governance is the most<br />\nImportant issue confronting the<br />\nHomewood campus is by now<br />\nacknowledged<br />\npractically<br />\nby<br />\neveryone.

Will we then lose<br />\nthe summer, only to start again<br />\nfrom the beginning on the long,<br />\ntortuous road on which we have<br />\nbeen traveling this year?

It would be necessary,<br />\nMoreover, to arrange for the governance commission to meet<br />\nthree or four times over the summer to make use of the work done<br />\nby its staff. The expenses for<br />\nthe commmttee members (faculty, students, and administrators) should be paid with university funds.

Which were:<br />\n\"excitons.\"<br />\nAn exciton is a conceptual entity that<br />\nhas more \"stateness\" than \"thingness\"<br />\nabout it. When a photon strikes a<br />\nmolecule in an organic crystal with<br />\nsufficient energy, it bumps an electron<br />\nto a higher energy level, leaving a<br />\n\"hole\" in the molecule. In the brief<br />\ninterval before it falls back into its hole,<br />\nthe electron releases the energy it received from the photon, which propagates another hole-electron pair in a<br />\nneighboring molecule, and thus on<br />\n<br />\nthrough the crystal.<br />\nThis phenomenon is called the<br />\n\"singlet\" excited state: or the singlet<br />\nexciton. Du Pont scientists have produced it with a 150-watt bulb. In the<br />\nsinglet, an electron is excited without<br />\nany change in direction of its spin or<br />\nmagnetic moment. It dies quickly, and<br />\na blue light emerges from the crystal.<br />\nBut with an intense light source, such<br />\nas the laser, an even more interesting<br />\nexcited state has been produced: the<br />\n\"triplet.\"<br />\nIn the triplet, the spin of the excited<br />\nelectron is reversed, a magnetic field<br />\nis produced, and the excited state lasts<br />\na million times as long\u2014about a hundredth of a second. Du Pont researchers<br />\nhave also found that two triplets can<br />\ncombine, producing a singlet exciton<br />\nwith greatly increased energy and a<br />\nlife span of a hundred millionth of a<br />\nsecond. Of promising interest is that<br />\nthis tendency of triplets to merge can<br />\n<br />\nbe sensitively controlled by applying a<br />\nmagnetic field to the crystal.<br />\nPerhaps the next step will be the<br />\nengineering of devices that manipulate<br />\nlight signals directly, bypassing the<br />\npresent need to convert them first into<br />\nelectrical signals and then back into<br />\nlight.

At present, three Hopkins undergraduates are involved in modern dance courses offered<br />\nby Goucher's Physical Education Department.<br />\nHardliners in sports might find it hard to stomach the inclusion of<br />\nmodern dance in their definition of sport. Yet it seems that within<br />\nthe<br />\nwide spectrum of physical education, modern dance is right at<br />\nhome<br />\nwith the more conventional sports.<br />\nRather than being a sissified activity, modern dance takes a considerable amount of coordination, physical exertion and grace. A nonviolent \"float like a butterfly, stinglike a bee\" image comes to mind.<br />\nGiven the changing attitudes of freshman classes over the past few<br />\nyears and the eventual acceptance of females on the undergraduate<br />\nlevel, it seems only logical that Hopkins' Physical Education Department meet the needs of the students. A coordinated physical education program with Goucher would not only benefit Hopkins, but<br />\nalso<br />\nGoucher.<br />\nAs one Goucher sophomore (who spends many of her afternoons<br />\nat<br />\nthe Lilian Welsh gym at Goucher) put it:\"The presence of men in<br />\nthe<br />\ndance classes acts as an incentive for the girls to perform better.\"<br />\nAnother Goucher girl mentioned that \"there is so much more you can<br />\ndo in choreography when you have men in your company.\" She added<br />\nthat the body shapes complement each other inthe creation of spatial<br />\ndesign.<br />\nThe ramifications of this Goucher-Hopkins innovative arrangement<br />\nare not yet known. It might be possible for those who have not yet<br />\nknown. It might be possible for those who have a sincere interest in<br />\nlearning dance and who were repulsed for one reason or another from<br />\nHopkins fall physical education program to fulfill their requirement<br />\nin this manner.<br />\nIf Hopkins Athletic Director Marshall Turner does okay this approach to fulfilling physical education requirements for those who<br />\ndid fail in the fall, we hope that some may benOt from it. If this does<br />\ncome tc, pass, much of the credit belongs to freshman Chris Beach<br />\nand his senior advisor Frenchie Smith. Good job, guys.

Marc Solomon won the 200 individual<br />\nmedley and the 200 butterfly and Ware took the<br />\n200 free and the 100 free. Pete Weiss came in behind Ware in the 200 free, to make it a one, two<br />\nsweep for Hopkins in that event.<br />\n<br />\nThe high point of the meetwas,however,junior,<br />\nMike O'Donnell's win over Dave Zeski in the 200<br />\nyard breaststroke. He beat the all-Americanwith<br />\na time of 2.26.6 and broke both the varsity and<br />\nuniversity records in that event. This was a particularly satisfying meet for Hopkins to win. Dickinson always has a fair team and provides strong<br />\ncompetition; they were Middle Atlantic champions<br />\nin '66, '67, and '68.<br />\nThe final score shows an excellent all-around<br />\nperformance by Hopkins swimmers rather than an<br />\neasy win over poor oponents.

Howeever, its<br />\nrecommendations to the Academic Council, which has power<br />\nin such matters, are seldom defied. In a letter to the faculty,<br />\nDeal Allyn W.

In a Student Council poll of 52% of the<br />\nstudent body,(the greatest student<br />\nresponse in ten years)95% supported 4-1-4. Statements from<br />\nthen Student Council president<br />\nRussell Passarella indicate that<br />\nthe debate in the council was<br />\noperating under the tacit assumption that 4-1-4 or no reform at<br />\nall was the choice to be made.<br />\nThe faculty, however, was not<br />\nSO sure. Many professors claimed a four-week program was not<br />\nsuited to the framework of their<br />\ndepartments, especially in the<br />\nsciences. Dean Carl Swanson<br />\nsaid, \"In the biology department,<br />\nat least, it will be hard to figure<br />\nout a'mini-semester' program.\"<br />\nSome faculty members thought<br />\nthe plan was completely unrealistic for large lecture courses of<br />\nthe type they were used to teaching, while others worried over the<br />\ngut issue of an increase in salary<br />\nfor an increase in work.<br />\nAfter the Friday meeting of the<br />\nGeneral Assembly, vice-chairman Dr. Edwin S. Mills confidently predicted, \"Plan C (the 4-4<br />\ncalendar) will be approved.\" The<br />\nfaculty just didn't like what Dr.<br />\nRobert W.

It is<br />\neducational reform...the 'minisemester' is very vague and, if<br />\nit worked out, would be a major<br />\nChange.'<br />\nBut the student council was<br />\nthinking 4-1-4 when it met the<br />\nfollowing Monday night.<br />\n<br />\nFinal Appeal<br />\nThe members addressed their<br />\nfinal appeal directly to the Academic<br />\nCouncil, which was<br />\nscheduled to decide the question<br />\nOf Calendar reform two days<br />\nlater. In a two and a half page<br />\nletter preceeding the resolution<br />\nsubmitted to the Council,they explained that \"the preference of<br />\nthe student body has been clearly<br />\nShown to be plan A--the 4-1-4<br />\nProposal of Dr. Bevan's committee.t,<br />\nThe plan approved by the Council Wednesday afternoon was a<br />\nMobel of compromise; the intersession was shortened to three<br />\nweeks, and it was apparently decided that no formal courses<br />\nwould be taught during that<br />\nPeriod.

Lead, Excludes<br />\nTwo Groups at Meeting Here<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nSpecial to the News Letter<br /><br />\nThe New University Conference expelled the<br />\nProgressive Labor Party and the Workers-Student<br />\nAlliance from their ranks at their national convention held this weekend on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe expulsions took place at the opening<br />\nmeeting Saturday morning at Shaffei Hall. Discussion on the measure took up the entire<br />\nmorning session. The final vote was 42 to 15<br />\nfor expulsion, from both the convention delegates and the 'National Executive Committeemen.<br />\nThe meeting, one of four that NUC has each<br />\nyear, was closed to all except NUC members,<br />\nincluding the press. It attracted around 175<br />\nmembers, mainly from the east coast. Following<br />\nthe expulsions, credentials of those entering the<br />\nmeeting were checked to exclude anyone affiliated with the banned organizations.<br />\nOld-Line Politics<br />\nThe move for expulsion, which had the<br />\nbacking of the national leadership, was prompted<br />\nby what proponents of the measure called<br />\nPLP's and WSA's \"obstructionist\" tactics. The<br />\norganizations were accused of having set \"oldline\" politics which interfered with the development of NUC's ideology.<br />\nNUC claimed that PLP's ideology was firmly<br />\nset. This led, it was claimed, to non-compromising positions on the part of members of PLP<br />\nand WSA, which resulted in obstructions to any<br />\nmeasure which these organizations opposed. A<br /><br />\nDean Pappas represented the Baltimore Defense Committee at the conference.<br />\nphoto<br />\nby andersott<br /><br />\nsimilar split occured in the Students for a Democratic Society at their national convention last<br />\nsummer.<br />\nThe final vote for expulsion took place around<br />\nnoon on Saturday. Following a plea for continuing action despite the divisions, the meeting<br />\nadjourned to another room. Security guards<br />\nwere placed at the door of this room (Shaffer 3)<br />\nin order to keep members of PLP or WSA from<br />\nentering.<br />\nThe banned members then held a caucus in the<br />\noriginal meeting room. They were hoping to<br />\nmeet with the main body of NUC later that<br />\nafternoon and present some sort of proposal.<br />\nNUC, however, rejected the request for a meeting.<br />\nLet Them Eat<br />\nThe PLP and WSA members were allowed to<br />\neat the meals which they had paid for with<br />\ntheir registration fee; however separate tables<br />\nwere provided, away from the meeting room.<br />\nTim Stocks,an NUC member who was excluded,<br />\nstated that \"It was clear that the Nationals<br />\ndidn't want the NUC members talking to the<br />\nPLP and WSA people.\" A party held that night<br />\nat the home of Paul Lauter was declared closed<br />\nto the expelled members.<br />\nThe excluded group then prepared a four page<br />\nstatement which they presented to the organization on Sunday morning. In this they stated that<br />\n\"NUC should strive to become a mass organization.\"<br />\nThe reconvened session of the convention featured a panel discussion on \"Class struggle and<br />\nRevolution,\" with the presentation of three<br />\nposition papers. These were given by Terry<br />\nRubinski, Paul Clauter and Bob Ross.<br />\nMiss Rubinski stated that she was for a revolution, which she defined as \"the overthrow of<br />\nthe capitalistic system by violence.\" She went<br />\non to say that \"When the poor steal from the<br />\nrich they go to jail, but when the rich steal<br />\nfrom the poor they go to the bank.\"<br />\nClauter, who is from the University of Indiana,<br />\nstated that \"The Cultural Revolution is just a<br />\nmess, but a very nice mess.\" His statement<br />\n\"Mao and Lenin don't know what the fuck is<br />\ngoing on in America today,\" received mixed<br />\nresponse.<br />\nBob Ross presented the third paper. He began<br />\nby saying \"We are now in Act II of the 1970<br />\nIce Capades,\" and continued, pointing out that<br />\nthe NUC \"should defend the Black Revolutionaries, but their- position should not be our<br />\nown.\"<br />\nOn and On<br />\nThe convention continued with workshops<br />\nSaturday afternoon, a mass meeting panel discussion on organization Saturday night, and<br />\nfurther discussion of specific organizational<br />\nchanges on Sunday.<br />\nMike Ornstein, a member of the Hopkins<br /><br />\nMichael Ornstein of Hopkins N.U.C. refused to divulge any of the proceedings at the national meetphoto by !emit:<br />\ning on campus.<br /><br />\nchapter of NUC, refused to. comment on<br />\nAny aspects of the convention due to the press<br />\nblackout.

No final action was taken on the<br />\nmeasure.<br />\nA group of delegates brought up the question<br />\nof the morning expulsions at this meeting. The<br />\nnational leaders responded by discussing the<br />\nnumber of times they had received calls from<br />\nchapters with \"PL trouble.\"<br />\nThe expelled members claim that the charges<br />\nagainst them are vague, and that their opponents<br />\nhave not brought out any specific examples of<br />\nobstructionism. They further charged that the<br />\nentire resolution was railroaded through, pointing out that all but one of the executive<br />\ncommittee members voted for expulsion.<br />\nWe Try Harder<br />\nAlso claimed against the expelled members<br />\nwas that NUC came second in their loyalties.<br />\nPLP members answered that charge by pointing<br />\nout that members of the Women's Liberation<br />\nFront and the International Socialists are still in<br />\nNUC -despite their conflicting loyalties.<br />\nLocal NUC members John Ferchak and Mary<br />\nKennedy supported the move, Ferchak calling<br />\nit \"basically necessary\" and Kennedy saying she<br />\nwas \"glad it happened.\" The NUC situation was<br />\ncompared to that that faced SDS when they<br />\nexpelled PLP.

Harrold<br />\nCarswell to the Supreme Court, there<br />\nwas little surprise in Washington. It<br />\nwas, after all, Mr. Nixon who selected<br />\nChief Justice Burger last fall and Spiro<br />\nAgnew a little over a year ago. These<br />\nappointments have been interpreted in a<br />\nvariety of ways; that the President is<br />\nseeking to placate the South; that he<br />\ndesires to restore a \"balance\" to American governmental philosophy; or, most<br />\ncredibly, that the President favors quiet<br />\nmediocrity.<br />\nNone of the men Mr. Nixon has picked<br />\nto run the government vary from what<br />\nthe President has termed \"the conventional values of American life.\" So it<br />\nwas little surprise which greeted the<br />\nCarswell appointment. The judge is noted<br />\nonly for the fact that his outlook, lifestyle and qualifications are much more<br />\nnarrow than those of any previous Nixon<br />\nappointee. The judge has never accepted<br />\nan off-the-bench job, does not own stock<br />\nIn any companies and the only organizations he can claim membership in are<br />\nthe American Foreign Legion and the<br />\nVeterans of Foreign Wars. He is, as<br />\nattorney General Mitchel said of Haynsworth, as \"clean as a hound's tooth.\"<br /><br />\nSPECIAL<br />\nNOTICE<br />\nStudent<br />\nand<br />\nFaculty<br />\nDiscounts<br /><br />\nMr. Nixon's immediate Republican<br />\npredecessor, who is often and erroneously deemed a man of little accomplishment, selected men of a different<br />\nquality than Judges Carswell and Burger<br />\naltogether. They were Wall Street, Ivy<br />\nLeague and regarded as wise choices<br />\nfor the high court. Though Mr. Eisenhower wished them to pursue a conservative course, they, like many that reach<br />\nthe Court, changed considerably. Earl<br />\nWarren was the best example, however,<br />\nof a man who could adapt his philosophy<br />\nto the requirements of individual liberty<br />\nin the cases that faced him. When he<br />\nwas governor of California Justice Warren had one of the worst records in the<br />\nnation on the rights of criminals or other<br />\ncivil liberties. In his case, however, and<br />\nthose like his, it has been the essential<br />\nquality of the man that has provided<br />\nthe necessary change.<br /><br />\nEpitome of Mediocrity<br />\nJudge Carswell is the epitome of<br />\nmediocrity. He is a veteran and alumnus<br />\nof Duke University where he was secretary of his class. He lost a race for<br />\nthe Georgia Legislature and moved to<br />\nTallahassee.

This the kind way of interpreting his 1948 speech in which he<br />\nsaid that he was a white supremist and<br />\nbelieved the white race to be superior<br />\nto all others. The judge said in his<br />\nSenate Judiciary testimony that he found<br />\nhis very words repugnant and repudiated<br />\nthem unequivocally. The words themselves mean very little but to amplify<br />\nthe extremely narrow life that our next<br />\nSupreme Court Justice has lead. It is<br />\nInteresting to note, for instance, that<br />\nthe judge did not find his white supremacy oratory repugnant when he joined a<br />\ncountry club in 1956 which incorporated<br />\na public golf course threatened with<br />\ndesegregation. More than half his civil<br />\nrights decisions have been overturned<br />\nby higher courts. John Lowenthal, a<br />\nRutgers professor who was once a civil<br />\nrights attorney in Carwells Tallahassee<br />\ncourt, testified before the senate committee that he found the judge openly<br />\nhostile when he once tried to free sev-<br /><br />\nFull line of<br />\n4-wheel drive<br />\nwork and play<br />\nvehicles.<br />\n6 OR V8<br />\nrtn,<br />\nWAGONEER<br />\nGLADIATOR<br />\n4 OR V6<br />\nUNIVERSAL<br />\nEXCITING 'REPSTER' SERIES!<br />\nTAKE A TEST DRIVE TODAY!<br /><br />\nSALES\u2022SERVICE\u2022 PARTS<br /><br />\nauto repairs<br />\nBrakes<br />\nAlignment<br />\nTune-Up<br />\nGrease &amp; Oil Change<br />\nShock Absorbers<br />\nMufflers<br />\nAnti-Freeze<br />\nWheels<br /><br />\n:5Y<br /><br />\n.HONE-Y-/<br /><br />\nfRig'S tir(<br />\n1\\leNig<br />\nSU%<br /><br />\nAfter the Haynsworth struggle, there<br />\nis little doubt that G.

The<br />\nimportant factor is not the lack of<br />\nImpropriety in the judge's financial dealings but more the fact that Carswell is<br />\nnot opposed by organized labor.<br />\nBesides his excellent record as a<br />\nmediocre Southern conservative, what<br />\nrecomends judge Carswell to the high<br />\ncourt? Mr. Nixon has said many times<br />\nthat he is tired of the many arrogant<br />\nand strong men that have sat on the<br />\ncourt in the last too decades who have<br />\n\"imposed their social and political viewpoints on the American people.\" Mr.<br />\nNixon wants a court that will move<br />\nslower and not grab the initiative in<br />\nchanging the often backward legal opinion<br />\nin the United States.

Peter Hughes<br />\nJed Kirschbaum<br /><br />\nNow, to the President...<br />\nThe Discipline Code released recently by the Committee<br />\non Student Affairs is a far more acceptable document than<br />\nthat proposed by Lincoln Gordon during orientation week.<br />\nThe Committee's draft of the policy allows for far greater<br />\nstudent participation in the disciplinary process.<br />\nBecause of the responsibility which the \" Committee<br />\nvests in the students, there is a great danger that the draft<br />\nwill be vetoed or watered down by President Gordon. Dr.<br />\nGordon has been a strong proponent of the Committee<br />\nSystem as it is presently constituted at Homewood. Should<br />\nhe appreciably alter the C.S.A.'s, he will undercut his<br />\nprofessed attitude toward the system which he has so<br />\nstrongly \"supported.\" \u2022 There are two sections of the Student Affairs statement<br />\nwhich the President might choose to alter. The first is the<br />\nelimination of expulsion as a disciplinary action. The other<br />\nis the composition of the review board. These were the<br />\nsections about which .the President expressed the most<br />\nconcern, when he met with the Committee in November.<br />\nThe Committee decided to drop the possibility of a student being expelled for several valid reasons. Their most<br />\npersuasive explanation was that the expulsion penalty<br />\nleaves no possibility for rehabilitation or the \"possibility<br />\nof social education.\"<br />\nThe composition of the review board presented by the<br />\ncommittee provides for mature participation in decisionmaking processes by all segments of the University _community. Principles of judicial action justify the plan for<br />\nstudents to outweigh faculty and administration on the<br />\nreview board. Students are the only group which will be<br />\nsubject to the discipline policy. It is logical that the review<br />\nboard be comprised overwhelmingly of the appellants'<br />\npeers. The anomaly inherent in the Committee plan is not<br />\nthat students are in the majority on the review board, but<br />\nthat faculty and administrators are represented at all. The<br />\ncase of the administration member is particularly strange,<br />\nsince it is the administration which will be bringing the<br />\ncharges against the student.<br />\nThe inclusion of two faculty members and one administrator on the review board appears to be an appeasement<br />\nmeasure. It shows a measure of distrust in students which<br />\nis characteristic of Hopkins.<br />\nNevertheless, the inclusion of the faculty and administration members does not compromise the Committee's<br />\ndraft of the discipline code significantly. On the whole, it<br />\nis a good measure, and we strongly urge that it be adopted<br />\nin its present form. We further urge that students register '<br />\ntheir support of this draft with their representatives, faculty<br />\nmembers with whom they speak and Dr. Gordon (should<br />\nthey happen to see him). Strong student support for this<br />\nmeasure can insure that it is not returned to its previous,<br />\nunacceptable form.<br /><br />\nThe final decision as to which buildings will actually<br />\nbe constructed will emerge from an administration,<br />\nfaculty and student consensus, according to McElwee,<br />\nalthough he did not elaborate on how such a consensus will be determined.' Newsletter, January 30<br />\nBoy, am I glad that we're going to have a consensus on the Master Plan. I really and truly am<br />\nglad, because the only alternative to a consensus<br />\nthat I can think of is violent revolution.(You want<br />\nto help blow up the admin building? We got this plan<br />\nin the history of art department, see...)So when<br />\nI read that article about the plan in Friday's News\u2014<br />\nLetter, I decided that McElwee is right. (John<br />\nMcElwee, in case you missed the article,is secretary of the Buildings and Grounds Committee for<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, and he has a plan to 'relieve the present bottlenecks in the parking and<br />\nbuilding facilities on campus.' It is quite a plan.<br />\nAnyway, I was lying on my bed sucking my thumb<br />\n- because if you have any opinions whatsoever<br />\nabout what is and what is not good architecture,<br />\nthe model of the proposed new buildings that was<br />\nshown in the Newsletter article sends you in shock.<br />\n- and thinking that the only bottleneck I'd like to<br />\nbreak is you-know -who's, when it dawned on me<br />\nthat Mr. McElwee had said something really deep<br />\nand true and worth thinking about. I mean, we<br />\nreally do need consensus if we're going to save<br />\npeople like me from doing terrible things to people like Mr. McElwee. And so I'd like to take a<br />\nfirst step toward achieving that devoutly-to-bedesired consensus, by telling the world what I<br />\nthink of the Master Plan, and maybe achieving a<br />\nlittle consensus along the way, among the student<br />\nbody. Not that we count.<br />\nWell, to begin with, I hope that I won't alienate<br />\nanyone when I say quite candidly that I think the<br />\nMaster Plan stinks. Because, if that bothers you,<br />\nyou aren't going to like at all what I have to say<br />\nnext. I think the Master Plan was drawn up by Spiro<br />\nAgnew and the Zenith City Chamber of Commerce,<br />\nwith the professional consultation of the militaryindustrial sleaze and a general disregard for human needs? Certainly not those cultivated old<br />\nMaryland aristocrats who comprise our Board of<br />\nTrustees? Or did I detect the emergence of a conflict between the sources of power and the sources<br />\nof taste along about - say - 1850? Such impressions<br />\nare so subtle and difficult to assess.<br />\nOh, it had to be the Zenith City Chamber of Com merce. Who else would dare to hire the architects<br />\nwho designed the new administration building.If we<br />\nare in this world of darkness and confusion to<br />\nacheive a consensus on anything, it should be on<br />\nthe fact the administration building is an unspeakable aesthetic disaster. I mean,do you realize that<br />\nit is going to have a mansard roof? We of course<br />\nunderstand that the elephant pits around the building exist just in case it should ever have to be defended, but why at the top that fond glance back to<br />\nthe Second Empire?<br />\nBut why speculate further? It is perfectly obvious that the architect - if that building has an<br />\narchitect - likes to build ugly buildings. And whoever does the hiring and firing around here likes<br /><br />\nto employ incompetent architects. We have already the Eisenhower Library and Shaffer Hall<br />\nto inform us of that. (A friend of mine labeled<br />\nthe style of the Library 'Mussolini Modern' and<br />\nShaffer clearly was designed by someone with<br />\nlong experience in the field of public housing.)<br />\nPerhaps, though, I am taking the wrong tack.<br />\nYou, you cute little electrical engineering major,<br />\nare probably wild about the library (and if you<br />\nlike the library, you're gonna go apeshit over the<br />\nadmin building). It may be that aesthetic considerations must remain the concern of a dissatisfied cadre of efete snobs buried on B level<br />\nof the Libes. What we're searching for is consensus, and so let's talk about a matter that is<br />\nnear and dear to the heart of everyone; do you<br />\nknow that the Buildings and Grounds Committee<br />\nwants to put up a parking garage on the southwest<br />\ncorner of the campus, and that this $2,500,000<br />\nbeauty has priority over a student union? Get you<br />\nwhere you live?<br />\nI mean, isn't. it typical? On the national level,<br />\nwe gotta get the Viet Cong first, and then if there's<br />\nanything left over, we fight the war on poverty,<br />\nright? And here at JHU,we provide shelter for the<br />\ncars, and if there's anything left over, maybe -just maybe --we can have something that you and<br />\nI can enjoy. Let me take back that remark about the<br />\nZenith City Chamber of Commerce.The committee<br />\nthat makes up priorities is composed of a Kharmann-Ghia, two Volkswagens and a Chevy Nova.<br />\nFurthermore, McElwee wants to tear down part<br />\nof Wyman Park(that's trees, people)and replace it<br />\nwith concrete.Trees, beauty, human scale, natural<br />\nresources, human resources: they all go, just so<br />\nthe fucking cars can have a place to park. The<br />\ntennis courts went for the admin building. Now the<br />\npark is to go for the parking garage. (I'd like to<br />\nkill a car. I'd like to take a knife and slit its drive<br />\nshaft from ear to ear. And smother its carburator,<br />\nand rip open its gas tank and let its guts slither to<br />\nthe ground. That's what I'd like to do to a car. And<br />\nthen I'd go down to the police station and turn myself in and they could do anything theyw anted to me,<br />\nand it wouldn't matter, because I'd be a happy<br />\nhumanoi(1.)<br />\nSo, there, McElwee, makes a consensus out of<br />\nthat. If you want a consensus with people, how<br />\nabout thinking about the things that people need!<br />\nIf you want a consensus with people, you've got to<br />\ntake our needs into consideration. You've just got<br />\nto! People want places to live and work and play<br />\nand talk together, which is what you can't do in a<br />\nparking garage. And they want beauty and ease of<br />\ngetting around (on foot) and some places where<br />\ntheir feet touch ground instead of concrete. And<br />\nthis place could be like that. It could be so everlovingly nice to live and work on the Johns Hopkins campus if people like you would just stop to<br />\nthink of what humans want, and then help us to<br />\nget it.<br />\nAnd instead, you build parking garages.

In light of all<br />\nthis, and in light of the fact that<br />\ndiscussion on whether the question of governance should even<br />\nbe discussed has occupied the<br />\nfirst five months of the academic<br />\nYear, we are now fortunate enough<br />\nto have a committee to determine<br />\nWhether a Commission should be<br />\nappointed to study the question<br />\nof governance in the division of<br />\nArts and Sciences. While not<br />\nquestioning the genuine sincerity<br />\nof the administration and faculty<br />\nin proceeding with all due haste<br />\nin this matter, as one who has<br />\nbeen intimately involved in the<br />\n\"discussions,\" I should like to<br />\nraise what I believe are several<br />\nrelevant questions.<br />\nWhy are there no students on<br />\nthe committee on the committee<br />\nWhose task it is to determine<br />\nWhether concern exists and the<br />\nnature of that concern? Students,<br />\nI think, have a unique contribution to make in this area.<br />\nWhy must it take at least two<br />\nMonths to answer the questions<br />\nthe<br />\nS.C., G.S.O. and several<br />\nfaculty members answered mahy<br />\nMonths ago?<br />\nWhy are the meetings of the<br />\ncommittee on the. committee to<br />\nbe \"closed?\" Governance is uniquely a problem which confronts<br />\nthe entire University and one in<br />\nwhich all of us have a stake.<br />\nPresumably, the committee on<br />\nthe committee will produce a report by the 9th of May, the Final<br />\nday of classes. Will we then lose<br />\nthe summer, only to start again<br />\nfrom the beginning on the long,<br />\ntortuous road on which we have<br />\nbeen traveling this year? Or will<br />\nthe University administration<br />\ntake the initiative, and as an indication both of concern and good<br />\nfaith, announce that a paid staff<br />\nWill be hired to work on the question of governance over the summer. It would be necessary,<br />\nMoreover, to arrange for the governance commission to meet<br />\nthree or four times over the summer to make use of the work done<br />\nby its staff. The expenses for<br />\nthe commmttee members (faculty, students, and administrators) should be paid with university funds. This would make the<br />\nsummer the most productive part<br />\nof the year and ensure that no time<br />\nor momentum would be lost. The<br />\nquestion of governance of the<br />\nUniversity is the most important<br />\nissue facing the Hopkins comm unity.<br />\nIt would be unfo'rtunate for a<br />\nconfrontation to occur over process and method; there surely<br />\nwill be disagreement over the<br />\nProposals submitted for changes<br />\nin the decision-making mechanisms.

Which were:<br />\n\"excitons.\"<br />\nAn exciton is a conceptual entity that<br />\nhas more \"stateness\" than \"thingness\"<br />\nabout it. When a photon strikes a<br />\nmolecule in an organic crystal with<br />\nsufficient energy, it bumps an electron<br />\nto a higher energy level, leaving a<br />\n\"hole\" in the molecule. In the brief<br />\ninterval before it falls back into its hole,<br />\nthe electron releases the energy it received from the photon, which propagates another hole-electron pair in a<br />\nneighboring molecule, and thus on<br /><br />\nthrough the crystal.<br />\nThis phenomenon is called the<br />\n\"singlet\" excited state: or the singlet<br />\nexciton. Du Pont scientists have produced it with a 150-watt bulb. In the<br />\nsinglet, an electron is excited without<br />\nany change in direction of its spin or<br />\nmagnetic moment. It dies quickly, and<br />\na blue light emerges from the crystal.<br />\nBut with an intense light source, such<br />\nas the laser, an even more interesting<br />\nexcited state has been produced: the<br />\n\"triplet.\"<br />\nIn the triplet, the spin of the excited<br />\nelectron is reversed, a magnetic field<br />\nis produced, and the excited state lasts<br />\na million times as long\u2014about a hundredth of a second. Du Pont researchers<br />\nhave also found that two triplets can<br />\ncombine, producing a singlet exciton<br />\nwith greatly increased energy and a<br />\nlife span of a hundred millionth of a<br />\nsecond. Of promising interest is that<br />\nthis tendency of triplets to merge can<br /><br />\nbe sensitively controlled by applying a<br />\nmagnetic field to the crystal.<br />\nPerhaps the next step will be the<br />\nengineering of devices that manipulate<br />\nlight signals directly, bypassing the<br />\npresent need to convert them first into<br />\nelectrical signals and then back into<br />\nlight. Perhaps too this line of research<br />\nwill lead to greater understanding of<br />\nthe mechanisms of light-energy transfer itself, such as those involved in<br />\nphotosynthesis by living plants.

At present, three Hopkins undergraduates are involved in modern dance courses offered<br />\nby Goucher's Physical Education Department.<br />\nHardliners in sports might find it hard to stomach the inclusion of<br />\nmodern dance in their definition of sport. Yet it seems that within<br />\nthe<br />\nwide spectrum of physical education, modern dance is right at<br />\nhome<br />\nwith the more conventional sports.<br />\nRather than being a sissified activity, modern dance takes a considerable amount of coordination, physical exertion and grace. A nonviolent \"float like a butterfly, stinglike a bee\" image comes to mind.<br />\nGiven the changing attitudes of freshman classes over the past few<br />\nyears and the eventual acceptance of females on the undergraduate<br />\nlevel, it seems only logical that Hopkins' Physical Education Department meet the needs of the students. A coordinated physical education program with Goucher would not only benefit Hopkins, but<br />\nalso<br />\nGoucher.<br />\nAs one Goucher sophomore (who spends many of her afternoons<br />\nat<br />\nthe Lilian Welsh gym at Goucher) put it:\"The presence of men in<br />\nthe<br />\ndance classes acts as an incentive for the girls to perform better.\"<br />\nAnother Goucher girl mentioned that \"there is so much more you can<br />\ndo in choreography when you have men in your company.\" She added<br />\nthat the body shapes complement each other inthe creation of spatial<br />\ndesign.<br />\nThe ramifications of this Goucher-Hopkins innovative arrangement<br />\nare not yet known. It might be possible for those who have not yet<br />\nknown. It might be possible for those who have a sincere interest in<br />\nlearning dance and who were repulsed for one reason or another from<br />\nHopkins fall physical education program to fulfill their requirement<br />\nin this manner.<br />\nIf Hopkins Athletic Director Marshall Turner does okay this approach to fulfilling physical education requirements for those who<br />\ndid fail in the fall, we hope that some may benOt from it. If this does<br />\ncome tc, pass, much of the credit belongs to freshman Chris Beach<br />\nand his senior advisor Frenchie Smith. Good job, guys. I wish I'd<br />\nthought of it first.<br />\nSome other courses Goucher offers which may be of interest to<br />\nHopkins students are archery and horseback riding(there is a fee for<br />\nthe latter).<br /><br />\nCager'Captains Courageous'<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins' fencers, under<br />\nthe leadership of Coach Dick Oles<br />\nand co-captains, Gerry Yee and<br />\nKeith Fulling, now hold a 3-3<br />\nrecord having won their last three<br />\nmeets against Lafayette (21-6),<br />\nVirginia (15-12), and VMI(18-9).<br />\nThe team, due to a lack of practice and experience, had a slow<br />\nstart, losing in three away meets<br />\nto North Carolina State (20-7),<br />\nDuke (20-7), and the University<br />\nof North Carolina (22-5), but<br />\nseem to have the necessary momentum now.

Yet, this year, the<br />\nfreshmen team has expanded<br />\ngreatly, and has looked very fine<br />\nin its one meet so far against a<br />\nlocal fencing club, which it won<br />\n18-9. The team won eight out of<br />\nnine foil bouts, whilewinningfive<br />\nout of nine in both the epee and<br />\nsabre classes. Especially notable<br />\nin the victory were Bob Little<br />\n(3-0) and John Bender and three<br />\nothers tied with two victories and<br />\nand no defeats.<br /><br />\nThe true test for the Hopkins'<br />\nfencers will be its next match<br />\nagainst Temple, which has lost<br />\nalready to Army, Penn and Penn<br />\nState by the score of 11-16. Temple, for the last four or five years,<br />\nhas always been Hopkins'strongest competitor, and still poses a<br />\ngreat threat to the team, despite<br />\nits previous losses. As Coach<br />\nOles has written on the team bulletin board, \"Now the hard part<br />\nof the season begins.\"<br /><br />\nSwimmers Dunk Dickinson<br />\nSaturday, the varsity swimmers added another<br />\nvictory to a thus far successful season. Comfort's<br />\ncrew beat the Dickinson College team, 68 to 27,<br />\nwinning eight of eleven events. The medley relay<br />\ncomposed of Jim Scott, Kirby Weldon, Gene Bonte,<br />\nand Brian Turner, came from behind at the 200 to<br />\nwin with a respectable time of 4.03.<br />\nBoth Marc Solomon and Rick Ware were double<br />\nwinners. Marc Solomon won the 200 individual<br />\nmedley and the 200 butterfly and Ware took the<br />\n200 free and the 100 free. Pete Weiss came in behind Ware in the 200 free, to make it a one, two<br />\nsweep for Hopkins in that event.<br /><br />\nThe high point of the meetwas,however,junior,<br />\nMike O'Donnell's win over Dave Zeski in the 200<br />\nyard breaststroke. He beat the all-Americanwith<br />\na time of 2.26.6 and broke both the varsity and<br />\nuniversity records in that event. This was a particularly satisfying meet for Hopkins to win. Dickinson always has a fair team and provides strong<br />\ncompetition; they were Middle Atlantic champions<br />\nin '66, '67, and '68.<br />\nThe final score shows an excellent all-around<br />\nperformance by Hopkins swimmers rather than an<br />\neasy win over poor oponents.
