One of these<br />\nsteps is the adoption of a fraternity rushing agreement for the coming year.<br />\nMuch deliberation and discussion obviously are necessary before<br />\nan agreement can be reached. It can not be expected that any season will be ideal to each crowd. The only thing we hope for is that<br />\neach chapter will be broad-minded enough to see that some season<br />\nis agreed upon which will be for the interests of the fraternities as a<br />\nwhole and, therefore, make some sacrifice. Incidentally, such an<br />\nagreement would be most beneficial to the University. Advocates<br />\nof the long rushing period claim that such a season would benefit the<br />\nUniversity since it would not interfere with the training of football<br />\nmen. They point out also that the long period would provide time in<br />\nwhich the fraternity and the new man could look each other over and<br />\nthus prevent many regrets on both sides. On the other hand, upperclassmen occupy a great amount of their time in rushing new members, and, as a consequence, the studies and activities of both the<br />\nFreshmen and upperclassmen suffer. Naturally, the longer the period of rushing, the greater the amount of neglect of the studies.

One of these<br />\nsteps is the adoption of a fraternity rushing agreement for the coming year.<br />\nMuch deliberation and discussion obviously are necessary before<br />\nan agreement can be reached. It can not be expected that any season will be ideal to each crowd. The only thing we hope for is that<br />\neach chapter will be broad-minded enough to see that some season<br />\nis agreed upon which will be for the interests of the fraternities as a<br />\nwhole and, therefore, make some sacrifice. Incidentally, such an<br />\nagreement would be most beneficial to the University. Advocates<br />\nof the long rushing period claim that such a season would benefit the<br />\nUniversity since it would not interfere with the training of football<br />\nmen. They point out also that the long period would provide time in<br />\nwhich the fraternity and the new man could look each other over and<br />\nthus prevent many regrets on both sides. On the other hand, upperclassmen occupy a great amount of their time in rushing new members, and, as a consequence, the studies and activities of both the<br />\nFreshmen and upperclassmen suffer. Naturally, the longer the period of rushing, the greater the amount of neglect of the studies. It<br />\nis believed that a rushing season at least a month shorter would eliminate these faults, and at the same time, allow sufficient time for new<br />\nmen and fraternities to make up their minds concerning bids.<br />\nCertainly the present situation of deadlock can be improved upon<br />\nby compromise, and the proper time to reach an agreement is NOW.<br />\nHow about it, fraternity men?<br /><br />\n\"What awhale ofa difference<br /><br />\njust afew cents make!\"<br /><br />\nall the difference<br />\nbetween just an ordinary cigarette<br />\nand\u2014FATIMA,the most skillful<br />\nblend in cigarette history.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MAY 2, 1924<br /><br />\n\"FIDELIA\" A NOVEL OF COLLEGE<br />\nLIFE, APPEALS TO COLLEGIANS<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, believing that a college student should be able<br />\nto judge of the truth contained in a novel purporting to be about American college life, has asked a prominent Senior to review \"Fidelia,\" by<br />\nE.
