What concerns us is the background for the<br />\nformation of the group.

On<br />\nthe other hand, the large hall might be so arranged<br />\nas to be partitioned off into smaller rooms. In<br />\neither event, the building should be a beautiful, practical one.<br />\nExactly how the Board proposes to settle the question of Baltimore's most beautiful women's portraits,<br />\nwe do not know. It is truly a problem with many<br />\nramifications, but as we see it a lesser one. The real<br />\nproblem will arise when the construction is considered:<br />\nwhat is to be the site of the new hall?<br />\nObviously, the situation must be one suitable to<br />\ntraffic conditions. That is, it must be one proximal<br />\nto some large parking space, yet near enough to be<br />\nconvenient to bus riders. Too, the students must be<br />\nconsidered. The building cannot be too Mr removed<br />\nfrom the center of campus activity.<br />\nIt would be a shame to situate it in or near the<br />\nbowl or even on the quadrangle before Gilman. Despite the original plans for the University grounds,<br />\nthe effect created today by the undisturbed view of<br />\nGilman from Charles street is far more beautiful than<br />\nany building in that locale could possibly be. The<br />\nlarge grassy expanse, with the sloping, smooth cur-<br />\n<br />\nShriver<br />\nsite<br />\n<br />\nvature of the bowl and its drive, and the unbalanced<br />\ntrees in the background, afford the ideal setting for<br />\nGilman's white and red austere beauty.<br />\nWell, that's a bridge that will have to be crossed<br />\nin the future, although, as we see it, a site south of<br />\nLevering hall would probably be the most favorable.<br />\nAt any rate, the Hall is something to anticipate, and<br />\nsomething to appreciate.<br />\n<br />\nA new<br />\nHopkins<br />\nspirit<br />\n<br />\nThere are a few rather<br />\nsignificant aspects of the<br />\nsports scene at the Hopkins that seem to warrant<br />\nsome consideration at present. Certain aspects are contradictory, but neverthe-<br />\n<br />\nless outstanding.<br />\nFor one thing, we find it rather difficult to reconcile the spirit at the spontaneous, student-sponsored<br />\nPep rally in Levering yesterday with the comparatively poor showings at fall Lacrosse practice and the<br />\nearly basketball drills. We fully realize that preseason drills, especially with little or no coaching,<br />\nare hardly inspiring sessions calculated to spur men<br />\ninto participation. But on the other hand, athletes<br />\nat the Hopkins are supposedly interested in sports<br />\nfor sports sake, not necessarily in the crowds or plaudits<br />\nor cheers or letters. Be this the case, why aren't the<br />\nmen taking advantage of these opportunities to get<br />\ninto condition, and to have some good informal fun at<br />\nthe same time?<br />\nThe rally was swell. We were genuinely surprised<br />\nat the number of upper-classmen who attended, apparently both anxious and willing to sing and learn<br />\nthe yells. Yet the rowdy rah-rah upon which we<br />\nfrown was notably lacking. The Blue Jay band was<br />\nexcellent ,the remarks were short and the spirit notable.<br />\nMaybe we're in on the dawn of some sort of new<br />\nday . . . There is a definite place for a certain type<br />\nof spirit on the Hopkins campus; there are a sufficient number of people interested in stimulating it;<br />\nthe student body seems amenable to it.<br />\nThe bill-boards shouted<br />\nit, the post office was plastered with it\u2014Julien Bryan, professional photographer, lecturer, and newspaperman would give a lecture to the Hopkins students, illustrated with authentic photographs and<br />\nmovies, on the Nazi invasion of Poland.<br />\nIt would be a proud thing for the NE'WS-LETTER to<br />\nboast that the entire gymnasium was packed, filled to<br />\ncapacity, by the crush of the truth-hungry students. We<br />\nwish we could tell it that way. But the inescapable<br />\nfact is simply that there was no crowd of students,<br />\nthere was no eagerness for first-hand information,<br />\nthere was not even the modicum of courtesy a host<br />\n<br />\nThere are<br />\nnone so<br />\nblind<br />\n<br />\nshows to his guest.<br />\nThe gymnasium was filled, yes. But by middleaged and elderly men and women from all over Baltimore, who had probably made considerable sacrifice<br />\nto attend the week-night lecture. Less than twenty<br />\npercent present were Men from University classes,<br />\nmen of military age, subject to conscription.<br />\nIt is not important that Mr. Bryan proved less an<br />\nauthorative commentator than a well-informed tourist<br />\nsubstantiating his yarn with his own all too vivid photographs. It is not important ,either, that he was honest<br />\nenough to point out that his attitude was frankly prejudiced. That was quite obvious, and the compliment<br />\ndamned us as ignorant dolts. But what is ominous<br />\nis the complete detachment with which students on our<br />\nown campus\u2014and that means you, reader\u2014regard the<br />\nterrible events that are shoving civilization to virtual<br />\nchaos.<br />\nPerhaps there are some who would rather do their<br />\nthinking in a muddy shell-hole. We, on the NEWSthose,<br />\nLETTER staff hope in the near future to help<br />\ngymnasium<br />\na<br />\nin<br />\nseats<br />\nwiser men, who prefer the hard<br />\nor lecture hall.<br />\nIt is strange that in this<br />\nseason of myriad beauties,<br />\nof falling leaves turning end<br />\nover end, of rioting reds<br />\nand browns and yellows<br />\nand greens, of mischievous<br />\ngusts of wind, of wild upsweeping skies and outpuffed clouds, it is strange indeed, we say, that people must be reminded of the<br />\nbeauties of the season.<br />\nFor these weeks possess a peculiar charm of their<br />\nown, unmatched by any other time.How carefree are<br />\nthe swift raids of the wind devils upon the fallen<br />\nleaves, how bracing our deep gulps of fresh, tangy<br />\nair, how glorious the sight of blazing sumac, green and<br />\nyellow elm, and russet maple giants!

Believeing that he could sell<br />\nErie stock short and reap a tidy profit<br />\nfor himself, Drew made widespread<br />\nagreements to sell stock in the future<br />\nat lower than the prevailing price<br />\nThe time for delivery came. But<br />\nDrew, who had counted on purchasing<br />\nthe stock to meet his agreements, discovered that the stock he so badly<br />\nneeded was owned by none other<br />\nthan the Commodore. Drew paid thru<br />\nthe nose to the tune of several million dollars, and he never forgot the<br />\noccasion, which he later commemorated with an appropriate verse:<br />\n\"When a man sells what isn't his'n<br />\nHe must either pay or go to prison!\"<br />\n<br />\npapers and the minds of all U S<br />\ncitizens, so too does it dominate the<br />\npolitical thinking of collegians.<br />\nA tabulation of the polls taken on<br />\nvarious college campuses indicates<br />\n<br />\ntet vocal, which is to have and to<br />\nhold.

It is thumping hard for the college and university flying courses sponsored by the<br />\nfederal government through the Civil<br />\nAeronautics Authority.<br />\n\"Air travel is becoming increasingly important in many industries,<br />\nincluding geology, oil scouting, and<br />\nproduction. Many oil companies, both<br />\nlarge and small, own their ships and<br />\nuse them constantly. The ability to<br />\noperate a plane would be an asset to<br />\nmany workers in industry. The type<br />\nof flying instructions to be given here<br />\nis for light ships and is intended to<br />\nmake the student `at home in the air.'<br />\nWith this as a basis, students, if interested, could continue study in that<br />\nfield, and have a good foundation.\"<br />\nThe University of Tulsa Collegian<br />\npoints out the local advantages of<br />\nthe flight training course, as did<br />\nmost college editorials on the subject.<br />\nThe Campus Collegian of the University of Toledo had this to say in<br />\nfavor of the course: \"Students who<br />\nwill take the university's flying instruction course this year will receive valuable training in theory and<br />\nin actual flying that they could not<br />\nget elsewhere for ten times the cost.<br />\nSo far as safety in the training program is concerned, it is significant<br />\nthat out of several hundred students<br />\nwho were trained last year when the<br />\nprogram was in its experimental<br />\nstages, not one serious accident occurred.\"<br />\nSaid the University of West Virginia Athenaeum: \"Some students<br />\nshy from it because they think it will<br />\nplace them under military obligations.<br />\nThe course is not under false label.<br />\nIt is a civilan pilots training course<br />\nand is under the Civil Aeronautics<br />\nAuthority.

This game is a crucial ohe<br />\nto both teams, 'and Haverford eleven<br />\nis out to get Hopkins. They have<br />\nlost by 1 point margins in the past<br />\ntwo years, 7-6 in 1938 and 13-12 in<br />\n1937, and there is no doubt that Haverford has been saving a major part<br />\nof its strength for this fracas.<br />\nThe same injury jinx that has<br />\ntrailed the Blue team in its last two<br />\nencounters is present again this week.<br />\nA shoulder injury will keep Rosenthal from playing, and of course,<br />\nMiller's broken ankle will keep him<br />\nout of action. The Haverford officials<br />\nhave requested that Carroll, who<br />\nplayed end for them two years ago,<br />\nnot play and so, he will not be in<br />\n<br />\nMel Taymor<br />\n<br />\nJohn Milligan<br />\n<br />\nAthlete's Fool<br />\nby 'Toy'<br />\n<br />\nuniform. Otherwise, the men should<br />\nline up much the same as last week.<br />\nCharlie Rudo will, in all likelihood,<br />\nbe the spearhead of the attack. If<br />\nyou remember, it was his 80-yard<br />\nrun for a touchdown and Eddie Spilman's conversion of the extra point<br />\nthat won the game for JHU last year.<br />\nA better pass defense is necessary,<br />\nthough, than has been shown thus<br />\nfar. American U completed far too<br />\nmany toward the end of last week's<br />\nbattle to permit any laxity in that<br />\ndepartment. The offenses, though,<br />\nboth on the ground and in the air<br />\nis very good. It was through a pass<br />\nthat one of last week's scores was<br />\nmade.<br />\nHaverford's schedule thus far does<br />\nnot really picture the true prowess<br />\nof the team. In their first game Union<br />\nconquered them, 41-16. They tied Allegheney, a future foe of the Black<br />\nand Blue, 13-13, and last Saturday,<br />\nlost to Wesleyan, 56-6. Despite this<br />\npoor showing, the first team of the<br />\n<br />\nEdgar Spilman<br />\nFew boys go to more than one<br />\nschool, few boys go to two schools,<br />\nfew to three; Edgar Spilman went<br />\nto Roland Park, Gilman, St. James,<br />\nPoly, McDonogh, Boys Latin, Hopkins ,and \"the kid's movin' west.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhistle. Washington college kicks<br />\nto Hopkins. Two plays were gone<br />\nand so was Edgar Spilman, star<br />\ntriple threat JHU halfbaA. He had<br />\nhurt that pestering rib wOund he received in the Army lacrosse game<br />\nlast year. After a week and a half<br />\nlay off, Ed's back in uniform and<br />\nHopkins' hopes are high.<br />\nThe following interview with Edgar<br />\nSpilman took place in the \"Blue Bullet\" among such celebrities as Bud<br />\nDempsey, Evan Smith and Gilbert<br />\nVernon Rubens III. It was interrupted a half hour when Tommy<br />\nNicholson drove up in his \"Little<br />\nOne\" ('39 blue redwheeled packard)<br />\nwith Miss Valerie Landon.<br />\nSpirit. That's the word that typifies Edgar Spilman, Hopkins star.<br />\nSome college men like blondes,<br />\nsome like brunettes, some like red<br />\nheads, others like just hair; but Edgar Spilman likes \"exotic-mid-victorians.\"<br />\n<br />\nNot many football players make<br />\none touchdown in a game, not many<br />\nmake two, not many four; Edgar<br />\nSpilman, playing for the championship 951b class at McDonogh made<br />\n7 in one game and only carried the<br />\nball once.<br />\nGilman has lost to McDonogh 6 to<br />\n0 . . . 24 to 0. . . 40 to 0; but when<br />\nEdgar Spilman<br />\n<br />\nplayed on McDon-<br />\n<br />\nogh's 951b class team, Gilman lost<br />\n110 to 0.<br />\nSome boys never get a chance to<br />\ngo to school, some boys go to school<br />\nsix years, some go ten years, some<br />\nfourteen years; but only Edgar Spilman goes on forever.<br />\n<br />\nRed and Black has plenty of power<br />\nto throw against the Hopkins' forward wall. On the whole, Haverford<br />\nplays an orthodox game of football,<br />\nthrowing caution to the winds only<br />\nduring the closing moments of a<br />\nlosing fight. The first string eleven<br />\nis in good physical condition.<br />\nProbably the best lineman on the<br />\nteam is captain B Williams. He has<br />\na hand_ in almost every play and is<br />\nthe moving spirit of the team. The<br />\nleft-end, J Dorsey, is also a man who<br />\nwill bear watching. He is fast-charging and is dangerous when breaking<br />\nup a kicking or passing play. Hopkins passers will have to keep on<br />\ntheir toes during the entire sixty<br />\nminutes if they expect to complete<br />\nany tosses against the rushing Haverford foreward wall.<br />\nThe backfield presents a good<br />\nkicker in Ken Prescott. The passing<br />\ncombination of Magill to Magill is a<br />\ndangerous offensive weapon. Against<br />\nAllegheny they completed innumerable short passes over a weak portion<br />\nof the opposing line.<br />\nCoach Mallonee, however, feels confident that Hopkins can match and<br />\nexcel anything on the Haverford list<br />\nof tricks. Moreover, the Haverford<br />\neleven is sadly lacking in reserves,<br />\nand a tiring game should give the<br />\nBlue Jays the advantage.

The low score<br />\nis no indication of the complete mastery which the aJys held over their<br />\nopponents.<br />\nHopkins kicked off to the American 15 from where it was run back<br />\nby Norford to the 25. The Americans<br />\nwere unable to gain, and as Strietzberger dropped back to kick, Milt<br />\nRudo who incidentally played brilliant ball the entire game, crashed<br />\nthrough to block the kick, and fell<br />\non the ball on the American 15.

The<br />\nslides taken by Mr Bryan during<br />\n<br />\nence of Christians and Jews from its<br />\norigination in 1936 until the present<br />\n<br />\nhis daring stay at Warsaw in the<br />\nthick of the fighting, caught the<br />\n<br />\nDr Calvert spoke for the Protestants. His lecture was divided into<br />\ntwo parts. In the first part he discussed the differences between the<br />\nCatholic and Protestant faiths, and<br />\nin the second, the differences between<br />\nProtestant and Jewish.<br />\nOne point of difference between the<br />\nCatholic and Protestant creeds which<br />\nDr Calvert stressed in his lecture was<br />\nthe desire \u2022of the Catholic religion is<br />\nto bring about a union of church and<br />\nstate. The protestants, however, believe that the church and the state<br />\nshould remain separate institutions.<br />\nThis difference in opinion is caused<br />\nby the Catholic belief that the authority of the church can be increased<br />\nby ecclesiastical power in government, while the Protestants belief is<br />\nthat the power of the church should<br />\nbe in its moral and spiritual influence.<br />\nIn the second half of his lecture<br />\nDr Calvert discussed the differences<br />\nbetween the Jewish and Protestant<br />\ndoctrines. He was of the opinion that<br />\nthe differences between these two<br />\ncreeds boiled down to the Jewish<br />\ndoctrine of racial and<br />\ncultural<br />\nsolidarity, as compared to the<br />\nProtestant<br />\nbelief in<br />\ncu 1 tural<br />\npluralism.<br />\n<br />\nspirit of a bombarded city.

Mr Bryan, admitting an unavoidable prejudice against the Nazis,<br />\ndrew certain conclusions from these<br />\nand other similar scenes. He said<br />\nthat the war seemed to be aimed<br />\nprincipally at the people of Poland<br />\nin an attempt to break their morale.<br />\nAfter the lecture, there was a<br />\nquestion period during which Mr<br />\nBryan answered<br />\n<br />\nqueries from the<br />\n<br />\naudience. Most of the questioners<br />\nasked for an opinion. There was one<br />\nfact question, however, about poison<br />\ngas, to which Mr Bryan replied that<br />\nthe army went faster than the gas<br />\ncould flow.<br />\nAt the meeting of the Supper club,<br />\nheld earlier in the evening, Mr Bryan<br />\ntalked more informally of his experiences in Warsaw.<br />\nThe next speaker slated for November 14, will be Dr Bernard Clausen, D D.<br />\n<br />\nSoccer . .<br />\n... cont. from page 3<br />\nter 50 yards in \"slugging\" penalties<br />\nIn the last period the Gettysburg<br />\nteam drove hard and tallied their<br />\nfourth and last marker on a high<br />\nlooping shot by Spangler which was<br />\ncarried<br />\n<br />\nby the<br />\n<br />\nwind<br />\n<br />\nbetween the<br />\n<br />\ncrossbar and goalie Butt's clutching<br />\nfingers.

Take<br />\nMr Mencken for instance\u2014if anybody<br />\n<br />\nkind of campaign against the cashand-carry bill that was fought in<br />\n1919. The issue of embargo versus<br />\ncash and carry appears to be taking<br />\non party lines again. The Republicans<br />\ntwenty years ago tried to make the<br />\nVersailles treaty a measure by which<br />\nthey could defeat the Democrats; today there seems to be a tendency on<br />\nthe part of the embargo men to<br />\nutilize neutrality legislation as a<br />\nmeans to sabotage the current administration.<br />\nThis is political skullduggery of the<br />\nmost shameless type.

It's<br />\ntoo bad that Mr Mencken should be<br />\ndenied the privilege of closer observation of a phenemenon which interests him so much. I think that there's<br />\none army which could give him a job.<br />\nIt's a great advance in his writing<br />\nthat he's gotten over the habit of<br />\ncalling people names. I agree with<br />\nhim that it's childish and tends to<br />\nobscure the issue. His choice epithets,<br />\nthis Sunday, \"good Adolph\" and<br />\n\"comrade Hitler\" are far more<br />\nmature and illuminating. I'm sorry<br />\nfor Mr Mencken. Sorry for any man<br />\nwho must be so despised and hated<br />\nby the other human beings with whom<br />\nhe comes in contact, that he can say<br />\nthat he is one who \"frankly enjoys<br />\nthe spectacle of war.\"<br />\nNot Peace\u2014But The Spoils:<br />\nIt has been pretty clearly established that two decades ago, when<br />\nthe Versailles Treaty came up in the<br />\nSenate for ratification, there were a<br />\ncertain number of diehards who were<br />\nout to defeat it from the start and<br />\neventually succeeded. What they<br />\nreally thought of the treaty, and of<br />\nthe Covenant of the League of nations<br />\nas a piece of national policy, we don't<br />\nknow. What we do know, is that this<br />\ngroup sized on it as a political target,<br />\nwith which they could identify Wilson,<br />\nand by defeating the treaty build up<br />\nthe Republican party. The manipulations by which they achieved their<br />\nend smacked of the most sordid kind<br />\nof party politics; a method hardly<br />\nto be recommended for dealing with<br />\nissues of national and international<br />\n<br />\nBIRELY'S PHARMACY<br />\nSt. Paul at 33rd St.<br />\nHopkins Men Welcome<br />\n<br />\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute is<br />\nsponsoring a movement to collect<br />\n<br />\nmancy is a practice<br />\ndeserving<br />\ncondemnation.

Don Kirkwood is,<br />\nfor all practical intents and<br />\npurposes, the Board. For almost the entire length<br />\nof the Board's existence, and certainly for the whole<br />\nof this year, Kirkwood has shouldered the burden by<br />\nhimself\u2014bearing the brunt of the load of negotiations<br />\nand publicity which is the committee's job.<br />\nDon's done a darn good job, too, but that's not the<br />\npoint. What concerns us is the background for the<br />\nformation of the group. When the Student Council<br />\nformed the group, it was intended to be a democratic<br />\norganization, designed to eliminate viciousness of an<br />\nold unrepresentative Cotillion board. The class presidents were made members to insure student voice in<br />\nselection of members.<br />\nWell and good. They're members all right, but<br />\nnow it has devolved from an undemocratic system to a<br />\nde facto autocratic one. What's happened? Is the<br />\nBoard too large to get all \u2022of its members togethdtfor a meeting, or is it just that there's a general lack<br />\nof interest? In either event we urge a prompt consideration of revisional measures by the Council.<br />\nThis incidentally is another item that was included<br />\nin many of the present Councilmen's platforms, but<br />\nof which we've heard nothing since elections.<br />\nWe may be accused of refusing to let well enough<br />\nalone, of going out of our way to look for trouble.<br />\nBut the points are these: First, there's not always<br />\ngoing to be a Don Kirkwood with the Board; and<br />\nsecond, when a thing is designed to meet two requirements, it's job is not done until it has met both. The<br />\nHopkins is getting the social program it wants, but<br />\nit hasn't got the Board it wants. It has no Board!<br /><br />\nBored<br />\nwith<br />\nboards<br /><br />\nThe acceptance of the<br />\nShriver bequest by the<br />\nBoard of Trustees is to our<br />\nminds ample cause for a<br />\ngood deal of rejoicing all<br />\naround. There has been felt,<br />\nfor a long time, a definite<br />\nneed on the campus for either a lecture room large<br />\nenough to hold well over a thousand people, or an<br />\nauditorium of similar capacity. Specifically, this is<br />\nwhat is provided for.<br />\nThere are many possibilities held open. There<br />\nmay be a large hall with several smaller lecture rooms,<br />\nand the University administrative offices, which would<br />\nrelieve much of the congestion in Remsen hall. On<br />\nthe other hand, the large hall might be so arranged<br />\nas to be partitioned off into smaller rooms. In<br />\neither event, the building should be a beautiful, practical one.<br />\nExactly how the Board proposes to settle the question of Baltimore's most beautiful women's portraits,<br />\nwe do not know. It is truly a problem with many<br />\nramifications, but as we see it a lesser one. The real<br />\nproblem will arise when the construction is considered:<br />\nwhat is to be the site of the new hall?<br />\nObviously, the situation must be one suitable to<br />\ntraffic conditions. That is, it must be one proximal<br />\nto some large parking space, yet near enough to be<br />\nconvenient to bus riders. Too, the students must be<br />\nconsidered. The building cannot be too Mr removed<br />\nfrom the center of campus activity.<br />\nIt would be a shame to situate it in or near the<br />\nbowl or even on the quadrangle before Gilman. Despite the original plans for the University grounds,<br />\nthe effect created today by the undisturbed view of<br />\nGilman from Charles street is far more beautiful than<br />\nany building in that locale could possibly be. The<br />\nlarge grassy expanse, with the sloping, smooth cur-<br /><br />\nShriver<br />\nsite<br /><br />\nvature of the bowl and its drive, and the unbalanced<br />\ntrees in the background, afford the ideal setting for<br />\nGilman's white and red austere beauty.<br />\nWell, that's a bridge that will have to be crossed<br />\nin the future, although, as we see it, a site south of<br />\nLevering hall would probably be the most favorable.<br />\nAt any rate, the Hall is something to anticipate, and<br />\nsomething to appreciate.<br /><br />\nA new<br />\nHopkins<br />\nspirit<br /><br />\nThere are a few rather<br />\nsignificant aspects of the<br />\nsports scene at the Hopkins that seem to warrant<br />\nsome consideration at present. Certain aspects are contradictory, but neverthe-<br /><br />\nless outstanding.<br />\nFor one thing, we find it rather difficult to reconcile the spirit at the spontaneous, student-sponsored<br />\nPep rally in Levering yesterday with the comparatively poor showings at fall Lacrosse practice and the<br />\nearly basketball drills. We fully realize that preseason drills, especially with little or no coaching,<br />\nare hardly inspiring sessions calculated to spur men<br />\ninto participation. But on the other hand, athletes<br />\nat the Hopkins are supposedly interested in sports<br />\nfor sports sake, not necessarily in the crowds or plaudits<br />\nor cheers or letters. Be this the case, why aren't the<br />\nmen taking advantage of these opportunities to get<br />\ninto condition, and to have some good informal fun at<br />\nthe same time?<br />\nThe rally was swell. We were genuinely surprised<br />\nat the number of upper-classmen who attended, apparently both anxious and willing to sing and learn<br />\nthe yells. Yet the rowdy rah-rah upon which we<br />\nfrown was notably lacking. The Blue Jay band was<br />\nexcellent ,the remarks were short and the spirit notable.<br />\nMaybe we're in on the dawn of some sort of new<br />\nday . . . There is a definite place for a certain type<br />\nof spirit on the Hopkins campus; there are a sufficient number of people interested in stimulating it;<br />\nthe student body seems amenable to it.<br />\nThe bill-boards shouted<br />\nit, the post office was plastered with it\u2014Julien Bryan, professional photographer, lecturer, and newspaperman would give a lecture to the Hopkins students, illustrated with authentic photographs and<br />\nmovies, on the Nazi invasion of Poland.<br />\nIt would be a proud thing for the NE'WS-LETTER to<br />\nboast that the entire gymnasium was packed, filled to<br />\ncapacity, by the crush of the truth-hungry students. We<br />\nwish we could tell it that way. But the inescapable<br />\nfact is simply that there was no crowd of students,<br />\nthere was no eagerness for first-hand information,<br />\nthere was not even the modicum of courtesy a host<br /><br />\nThere are<br />\nnone so<br />\nblind<br /><br />\nshows to his guest.<br />\nThe gymnasium was filled, yes.

Less than twenty<br />\npercent present were Men from University classes,<br />\nmen of military age, subject to conscription.<br />\nIt is not important that Mr. Bryan proved less an<br />\nauthorative commentator than a well-informed tourist<br />\nsubstantiating his yarn with his own all too vivid photographs. It is not important ,either, that he was honest<br />\nenough to point out that his attitude was frankly prejudiced. That was quite obvious, and the compliment<br />\ndamned us as ignorant dolts.

But<br />\nDrew, who had counted on purchasing<br />\nthe stock to meet his agreements, discovered that the stock he so badly<br />\nneeded was owned by none other<br />\nthan the Commodore.

It is thumping hard for the college and university flying courses sponsored by the<br />\nfederal government through the Civil<br />\nAeronautics Authority.<br />\n\"Air travel is becoming increasingly important in many industries,<br />\nincluding geology, oil scouting, and<br />\nproduction. Many oil companies, both<br />\nlarge and small, own their ships and<br />\nuse them constantly. The ability to<br />\noperate a plane would be an asset to<br />\nmany workers in industry. The type<br />\nof flying instructions to be given here<br />\nis for light ships and is intended to<br />\nmake the student `at home in the air.'<br />\nWith this as a basis, students, if interested, could continue study in that<br />\nfield, and have a good foundation.\"<br />\nThe University of Tulsa Collegian<br />\npoints out the local advantages of<br />\nthe flight training course, as did<br />\nmost college editorials on the subject.<br />\nThe Campus Collegian of the University of Toledo had this to say in<br />\nfavor of the course: \"Students who<br />\nwill take the university's flying instruction course this year will receive valuable training in theory and<br />\nin actual flying that they could not<br />\nget elsewhere for ten times the cost.<br />\nSo far as safety in the training program is concerned, it is significant<br />\nthat out of several hundred students<br />\nwho were trained last year when the<br />\nprogram was in its experimental<br />\nstages, not one serious accident occurred.\"<br />\nSaid the University of West Virginia Athenaeum: \"Some students<br />\nshy from it because they think it will<br />\nplace them under military obligations.<br />\nThe course is not under false label.<br />\nIt is a civilan pilots training course<br />\nand is under the Civil Aeronautics<br />\nAuthority.

This game is a crucial ohe<br />\nto both teams, 'and Haverford eleven<br />\nis out to get Hopkins. They have<br />\nlost by 1 point margins in the past<br />\ntwo years, 7-6 in 1938 and 13-12 in<br />\n1937, and there is no doubt that Haverford has been saving a major part<br />\nof its strength for this fracas.<br />\nThe same injury jinx that has<br />\ntrailed the Blue team in its last two<br />\nencounters is present again this week.<br />\nA shoulder injury will keep Rosenthal from playing, and of course,<br />\nMiller's broken ankle will keep him<br />\nout of action. The Haverford officials<br />\nhave requested that Carroll, who<br />\nplayed end for them two years ago,<br />\nnot play and so, he will not be in<br /><br />\nMel Taymor<br /><br />\nJohn Milligan<br /><br />\nAthlete's Fool<br />\nby 'Toy'<br /><br />\nuniform. Otherwise, the men should<br />\nline up much the same as last week.<br />\nCharlie Rudo will, in all likelihood,<br />\nbe the spearhead of the attack. If<br />\nyou remember, it was his 80-yard<br />\nrun for a touchdown and Eddie Spilman's conversion of the extra point<br />\nthat won the game for JHU last year.<br />\nA better pass defense is necessary,<br />\nthough, than has been shown thus<br />\nfar. American U completed far too<br />\nmany toward the end of last week's<br />\nbattle to permit any laxity in that<br />\ndepartment. The offenses, though,<br />\nboth on the ground and in the air<br />\nis very good. It was through a pass<br />\nthat one of last week's scores was<br />\nmade.<br />\nHaverford's schedule thus far does<br />\nnot really picture the true prowess<br />\nof the team. In their first game Union<br />\nconquered them, 41-16. They tied Allegheney, a future foe of the Black<br />\nand Blue, 13-13, and last Saturday,<br />\nlost to Wesleyan, 56-6. Despite this<br />\npoor showing, the first team of the<br /><br />\nEdgar Spilman<br />\nFew boys go to more than one<br />\nschool, few boys go to two schools,<br />\nfew to three; Edgar Spilman went<br />\nto Roland Park, Gilman, St. James,<br />\nPoly, McDonogh, Boys Latin, Hopkins ,and \"the kid's movin' west.\"<br /><br />\nWhistle. Washington college kicks<br />\nto Hopkins. Two plays were gone<br />\nand so was Edgar Spilman, star<br />\ntriple threat JHU halfbaA. He had<br />\nhurt that pestering rib wOund he received in the Army lacrosse game<br />\nlast year. After a week and a half<br />\nlay off, Ed's back in uniform and<br />\nHopkins' hopes are high.<br />\nThe following interview with Edgar<br />\nSpilman took place in the \"Blue Bullet\" among such celebrities as Bud<br />\nDempsey, Evan Smith and Gilbert<br />\nVernon Rubens III. It was interrupted a half hour when Tommy<br />\nNicholson drove up in his \"Little<br />\nOne\" ('39 blue redwheeled packard)<br />\nwith Miss Valerie Landon.<br />\nSpirit. That's the word that typifies Edgar Spilman, Hopkins star.<br />\nSome college men like blondes,<br />\nsome like brunettes, some like red<br />\nheads, others like just hair; but Edgar Spilman likes \"exotic-mid-victorians.\"<br /><br />\nNot many football players make<br />\none touchdown in a game, not many<br />\nmake two, not many four; Edgar<br />\nSpilman, playing for the championship 951b class at McDonogh made<br />\n7 in one game and only carried the<br />\nball once.<br />\nGilman has lost to McDonogh 6 to<br />\n0 . . . 24 to 0. . . 40 to 0; but when<br />\nEdgar Spilman<br /><br />\nplayed on McDon-<br /><br />\nogh's 951b class team, Gilman lost<br />\n110 to 0.<br />\nSome boys never get a chance to<br />\ngo to school, some boys go to school<br />\nsix years, some go ten years, some<br />\nfourteen years; but only Edgar Spilman goes on forever.<br /><br />\nRed and Black has plenty of power<br />\nto throw against the Hopkins' forward wall. On the whole, Haverford<br />\nplays an orthodox game of football,<br />\nthrowing caution to the winds only<br />\nduring the closing moments of a<br />\nlosing fight. The first string eleven<br />\nis in good physical condition.<br />\nProbably the best lineman on the<br />\nteam is captain B Williams. He has<br />\na hand_ in almost every play and is<br />\nthe moving spirit of the team. The<br />\nleft-end, J Dorsey, is also a man who<br />\nwill bear watching. He is fast-charging and is dangerous when breaking<br />\nup a kicking or passing play. Hopkins passers will have to keep on<br />\ntheir toes during the entire sixty<br />\nminutes if they expect to complete<br />\nany tosses against the rushing Haverford foreward wall.<br />\nThe backfield presents a good<br />\nkicker in Ken Prescott. The passing<br />\ncombination of Magill to Magill is a<br />\ndangerous offensive weapon. Against<br />\nAllegheny they completed innumerable short passes over a weak portion<br />\nof the opposing line.<br />\nCoach Mallonee, however, feels confident that Hopkins can match and<br />\nexcel anything on the Haverford list<br />\nof tricks. Moreover, the Haverford<br />\neleven is sadly lacking in reserves,<br />\nand a tiring game should give the<br />\nBlue Jays the advantage.

But Harry had<br />\nstepped in where angels feared to<br />\ntread and cops didn't and he soon<br />\nlearned that a lacrosse stick could<br />\nbe used in more ways than one, (he<br />\nstill does).

The low score<br />\nis no indication of the complete mastery which the aJys held over their<br />\nopponents.<br />\nHopkins kicked off to the American 15 from where it was run back<br />\nby Norford to the 25. The Americans<br />\nwere unable to gain, and as Strietzberger dropped back to kick, Milt<br />\nRudo who incidentally played brilliant ball the entire game, crashed<br />\nthrough to block the kick, and fell<br />\non the ball on the American 15. Bill'<br />\nMcLean then crashed off tackle for<br />\nthe remaining 15 yards to score<br />\neasily. Bernstein converted the extra<br />\npoint by a placement kick and the<br />\nJays led 7 to 0.<br />\nThe Americans were unable to<br />\ngain through the fighting Hopkins<br />\nline after the kickoff, and the Jays<br />\nstarted their second touchdown drive<br />\nfrom their own 25. Runs by Bernstein, McLean and Rudo gave the<br />\nJays 5 first downs and put the ball<br />\non the Eagle 5. On the second down<br />\nBernstein, on a fake end run, passed<br />\nto McLean on the 2 yard line, and<br />\nthe latter scampered across for the<br />\nsecond tally. Bernstein again converted and the Jays held a big 14 to<br />\n0 lead.<br />\nAfter an exchange of punts, a bad<br />\nfourth down Eagle center gave the<br />\nball to the Jays on their own 37.<br />\nGosnell, Yaeger, Eichner, Ludenberg<br />\nand Hill substituted in the Jay line<br />\nwhile Brundige came into the backfield to replace Thomas. Ferrara, on<br />\nthe fourth down, threw a beautiful<br />\n35 yard pass to Carroll to score the<br />\nlast Jay touchdown of the game.<br />\nThis same passing combination accounted for the extra point. McCord<br />\nand Crites entered as the half ended.<br />\nFor the second half, Coach Mallonee started Carroll, Hill, Pritchett,<br />\nEichner, M.

His lecture was divided into<br />\ntwo parts. In the first part he discussed the differences between the<br />\nCatholic and Protestant faiths, and<br />\nin the second, the differences between<br />\nProtestant and Jewish.<br />\nOne point of difference between the<br />\nCatholic and Protestant creeds which<br />\nDr Calvert stressed in his lecture was<br />\nthe desire \u2022of the Catholic religion is<br />\nto bring about a union of church and<br />\nstate. The protestants, however, believe that the church and the state<br />\nshould remain separate institutions.<br />\nThis difference in opinion is caused<br />\nby the Catholic belief that the authority of the church can be increased<br />\nby ecclesiastical power in government, while the Protestants belief is<br />\nthat the power of the church should<br />\nbe in its moral and spiritual influence.<br />\nIn the second half of his lecture<br />\nDr Calvert discussed the differences<br />\nbetween the Jewish and Protestant<br />\ndoctrines. He was of the opinion that<br />\nthe differences between these two<br />\ncreeds boiled down to the Jewish<br />\ndoctrine of racial and<br />\ncultural<br />\nsolidarity, as compared to the<br />\nProtestant<br />\nbelief in<br />\ncu 1 tural<br />\npluralism.<br /><br />\nspirit of a bombarded city.

Mr Bryan, admitting an unavoidable prejudice against the Nazis,<br />\ndrew certain conclusions from these<br />\nand other similar scenes. He said<br />\nthat the war seemed to be aimed<br />\nprincipally at the people of Poland<br />\nin an attempt to break their morale.<br />\nAfter the lecture, there was a<br />\nquestion period during which Mr<br />\nBryan answered<br /><br />\nqueries from the<br /><br />\naudience. Most of the questioners<br />\nasked for an opinion. There was one<br />\nfact question, however, about poison<br />\ngas, to which Mr Bryan replied that<br />\nthe army went faster than the gas<br />\ncould flow.<br />\nAt the meeting of the Supper club,<br />\nheld earlier in the evening, Mr Bryan<br />\ntalked more informally of his experiences in Warsaw.<br />\nThe next speaker slated for November 14, will be Dr Bernard Clausen, D D.<br /><br />\nSoccer . .<br />\n... cont. from page 3<br />\nter 50 yards in \"slugging\" penalties<br />\nIn the last period the Gettysburg<br />\nteam drove hard and tallied their<br />\nfourth and last marker on a high<br />\nlooping shot by Spangler which was<br />\ncarried<br /><br />\nby the<br /><br />\nwind<br /><br />\nbetween the<br /><br />\ncrossbar and goalie Butt's clutching<br />\nfingers.

Take<br />\nMr Mencken for instance\u2014if anybody<br /><br />\nkind of campaign against the cashand-carry bill that was fought in<br />\n1919. The issue of embargo versus<br />\ncash and carry appears to be taking<br />\non party lines again. The Republicans<br />\ntwenty years ago tried to make the<br />\nVersailles treaty a measure by which<br />\nthey could defeat the Democrats; today there seems to be a tendency on<br />\nthe part of the embargo men to<br />\nutilize neutrality legislation as a<br />\nmeans to sabotage the current administration.<br />\nThis is political skullduggery of the<br />\nmost shameless type.

It's<br />\ntoo bad that Mr Mencken should be<br />\ndenied the privilege of closer observation of a phenemenon which interests him so much. I think that there's<br />\none army which could give him a job.<br />\nIt's a great advance in his writing<br />\nthat he's gotten over the habit of<br />\ncalling people names. I agree with<br />\nhim that it's childish and tends to<br />\nobscure the issue. His choice epithets,<br />\nthis Sunday, \"good Adolph\" and<br />\n\"comrade Hitler\" are far more<br />\nmature and illuminating. I'm sorry<br />\nfor Mr Mencken. Sorry for any man<br />\nwho must be so despised and hated<br />\nby the other human beings with whom<br />\nhe comes in contact, that he can say<br />\nthat he is one who \"frankly enjoys<br />\nthe spectacle of war.\"<br />\nNot Peace\u2014But The Spoils:<br />\nIt has been pretty clearly established that two decades ago, when<br />\nthe Versailles Treaty came up in the<br />\nSenate for ratification, there were a<br />\ncertain number of diehards who were<br />\nout to defeat it from the start and<br />\neventually succeeded. What they<br />\nreally thought of the treaty, and of<br />\nthe Covenant of the League of nations<br />\nas a piece of national policy, we don't<br />\nknow. What we do know, is that this<br />\ngroup sized on it as a political target,<br />\nwith which they could identify Wilson,<br />\nand by defeating the treaty build up<br />\nthe Republican party.
