Rather, I would work for the<br />\nadoption of some of the G.C.C. provisions by the<br />\npresent Judicial Committee of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nPerrotto: To the first question, I must say<br />\nthat I would not attempt to pass a central judiciary body such as the G.C.C. As Brian Henderson would say, if a mechanism, such as the<br />\nG.C.C. is set up, it would induce some people<br />\nto use it, which is not what is desired.<br />\nPresent Council<br />\nWhat is your opinion of the accomplishments<br />\nof this year's Student Council?<br />\nKesler: This year's Council, among other things,<br />\nestablished a much-needed formal election procedure and presented an improved assembly program.

Much of what the S.C. does involves the entire student body, not excepting the - dormitory<br />\nresidents. I also feel complete autonomy would<br />\nincrease the number and degree of the misunderstandings which often develop between the<br />\ntwo bodies.<br />\nPerrotto: I do not believe that the D.S.R.C.<br />\nshould be completely autonomous from the S.C.<br />\nThe D.S.R.C. knows the dormitory problems better than the S.C.; thus, it is in a better position<br />\nto take care of its own problems.

With considerable pride, however, he tells of his later undergraduate days at<br />\nRandolph-Macon, Hopkins' old rival, where he<br />\nwas a \"good\" student. After Randolph-Macon,<br />\nCol. Serena came to Hopkins as a graduate<br />\nstudent in education, while doubling as freshman<br />\nbasketball coach.

For<br />\nthe next fifteen years, Colonel Serena saw the<br />\nworld\u2014from Berlin and Heidelberg, to Arizona<br />\nand Georgia, and finally to Korea (twice). Not<br />\nalways a military tourist, the wayward graduate<br />\nstudent saw action in the Korean conflict and<br />\nfamiliarized himself with riot tactics in the East<br />\nGerman Revolt as well as in last year's student<br />\nand military revolts in Korea.

Rioting is regarded by<br />\nmany as a good natured, harmless method for young,<br />\nunmarried males, immured for a long, cold winter, to<br />\n\"let off some steam.\"<br />\nWe have always looked benignly on this \"fun\" and<br />\ntacitly encouraged some of it. However, one must recognize the possible dangers involved in mob action. It<br />\ntakes very little to convert a vigorous water fight into<br />\na dangerously mobile anti courageous mob. Fortunately<br />\nin recent years riots at Hopkins have not resulted in any<br />\nserious injury or destruction, but the potential for such<br />\nis great. This is especially true when the inevitable cry<br />\n\"To Charles Street!\" rings out anti the crowd spills off<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nWe do not urge complete suppression of boisterous<br />\nactivities. But we do urge the caution anti forethought<br />\ncharacteristic of the so-called \"Hopkins Gentleman.\"<br />\n<br />\nA Hopkins Welcome<br />\nEleven Russians, on a goodwill trip to the United<br />\nStates, are currently visiting the Hopkins campus under<br />\nthe auspices of the Levering Hall YMCA.

With considerable pride, however, he tells of his later undergraduate days at<br />\nRandolph-Macon, Hopkins' old rival, where he<br />\nwas a \"good\" student. After Randolph-Macon,<br />\nCol. Serena came to Hopkins as a graduate<br />\nstudent in education, while doubling as freshman<br />\nbasketball coach.

For<br />\nthe next fifteen years, Colonel Serena saw the<br />\nworld\u2014from Berlin and Heidelberg, to Arizona<br />\nand Georgia, and finally to Korea (twice). Not<br />\nalways a military tourist, the wayward graduate<br />\nstudent saw action in the Korean conflict and<br />\nfamiliarized himself with riot tactics in the East<br />\nGerman Revolt as well as in last year's student<br />\nand military revolts in Korea.

Rioting is regarded by<br />\nmany as a good natured, harmless method for young,<br />\nunmarried males, immured for a long, cold winter, to<br />\n\"let off some steam.\"<br />\nWe have always looked benignly on this \"fun\" and<br />\ntacitly encouraged some of it. However, one must recognize the possible dangers involved in mob action. It<br />\ntakes very little to convert a vigorous water fight into<br />\na dangerously mobile anti courageous mob. Fortunately<br />\nin recent years riots at Hopkins have not resulted in any<br />\nserious injury or destruction, but the potential for such<br />\nis great. This is especially true when the inevitable cry<br />\n\"To Charles Street!\" rings out anti the crowd spills off<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nWe do not urge complete suppression of boisterous<br />\nactivities. But we do urge the caution anti forethought<br />\ncharacteristic of the so-called \"Hopkins Gentleman.\"<br /><br />\nA Hopkins Welcome<br />\nEleven Russians, on a goodwill trip to the United<br />\nStates, are currently visiting the Hopkins campus under<br />\nthe auspices of the Levering Hall YMCA.

The squad began<br />\npractice last week under Coach<br />\nRoss Sachs.<br />\nSachs will have four top starters to call on in Bob Keane, Stan<br />\nMazanek, Dave Leonhard, and<br />\nDave Sachs. Both Keane and<br />\nMazanek pitched for the varsity<br />\nlast season.<br />\nKeane To Pitch More<br />\nKeane, a right-hander, alternated between first base and the<br />\nmound last season. Sachs wants<br />\nto pitch him more this season,<br />\nIf he can find a good first-baseman to replace him. Keane is not<br />\nas fast as the rest of the team's<br />\nstarters, but he has good stuff<br />\nand good control.<br />\nMazanek, also a right-hander,<br />\nhas good speed. Right now, he<br />\nseems to be the top hurler on<br />\nthe team. The hard-throwing<br />\nLeonhard has a blazing fast ball.<br />\nThe only left-hander on the<br />\nsquad is Dave Sachs. Up from<br />\nthe 1961 frosh team, he rounds<br />\nout Coach Sach's big four.<br />\n\"Pretty Good Staff\"<br />\n\"We'll have a pretty good<br />\npitching staff,\" commented Sachs<br />\nafter watching his team's first<br />\nweek of practice. \"Our top four<br />\n;pitchers will probably have to<br />\ncarry the load for us.<br />\n'<br />\nwe don't run into arm<br />\ntrouble or any other injuries to<br />\nou4 pitchers, we might hang in<br />\nthere all the way.
