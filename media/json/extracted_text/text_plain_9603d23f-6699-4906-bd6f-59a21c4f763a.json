This<br />\nleaves vacancies in two Imograms: American History and<br />\nAtlantic History and Culture.<br />\nThe vacancy was created when<br />\n<br />\nCourse Guide Makes Revisions<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIn New Student Questionnaires<br />\nBY MITCHELL D. SMITH<br />\nThe Course Guide has revised , the questionnaire it<br />\ndistributes to students in order<br />\nto solicit more meaningful and<br />\naccurate evaluations of classes.<br />\nAccording to the editor Pam<br />\nHorn, many of the questions<br />\nhave been rewritten to insure<br />\nuniform responses from students.<br />\nIn past years, questions such<br />\nas the one dealing with the<br />\namount of time spent on a<br />\ncours.: have drawn varied responses because students would<br />\ninclude the number of class<br />\nhours. On the new questionnaire<br />\nthat will be distributed this<br />\nsemester, the question specifically asks for the number of hours<br />\noutside of class.<br />\nIn addition to wording<br />\nmany of the questions more<br />\nclearly, some new questions have<br />\nbeen added. A new section of<br />\nthe evaluation form deals with<br />\nthe course material and subject<br />\nmatter. This section was included because many students<br />\nhave included comments about<br />\nthe material on the questionnaires in the past. By including<br />\nspecific questions on the subject<br />\nmatter, the Course Guide staff<br />\nhopes to find out how the<br />\naverage student in a class, rather<br />\nthan those with special complaints, feels about the content<br />\nof the course.<br />\n<br />\nIn the past, the Course<br />\nGuide has received comments<br />\nfrom students questioning why<br />\nalmost all of the courses and<br />\nprofessors consistently receive<br />\nhigh grades. The staff writers<br />\ncalculate these grades directly<br />\nfrom the student's responses, so<br />\nthe grades can only be as accur-<br />\n<br />\nate as the responses. \"If students would be more critical of<br />\ntheir classes, we would have<br />\na better picture of the quality of<br />\neducation at Hopkins,\" commented staff writer Lori Malloy.<br />\nAt a meeting between the<br />\nStudent Council Education<br />\ncont. on p. 3<br />\n<br />\nRay Kea, a junior faculty<br />\nmember in the History Department, and one of few minority<br />\nfaculty members, was not promoted and left.<br />\nThe History Department<br />\nstarted a search for a junior<br />\nfaculty member to replace Kea,<br />\nbut the effort proved unsuccessful. Instead of hiring a junior<br />\nfaculty member who could fill<br />\nKea's position, the department<br />\nfound a young, tenured associate<br />\nprofessor at the University of<br />\nMichigan, Tom Holt, whom Suskind declined to appoint.<br />\n\"Holt was particularly desirable for three reasons,\" said<br />\nhistory<br />\nprofessor<br />\nLouis<br />\nGalambos. \"1) He has got an<br />\nexcellent book in American<br />\nHistory, and he's provided some<br />\nsupport there. 2) He's now<br />\nworking on Caribbean race relations, so he'd strengthen the<br />\nAtlantic History and Culture<br />\n<br />\nprogram, 3) He has a very sophisticated quantitative methodologand incidently, 4) He'd be a<br />\nminority appointment. He's an<br />\nunusual person and I hope we<br />\ndon't miss the opportunity to<br />\nget a great 'Hopkins-type' person.\"<br />\nThe entire History faculty is<br />\nequally enthusiastic about Holt.<br />\nDr. Franklin Knight, presently<br />\na professor in the Atlantic<br />\nprogram and himself one of the<br />\nfew minority full professors at<br />\nHopkins, is familiar with Holt's<br />\nwork. \"I think his book (Black<br />\nover White: Negro Political<br />\nLeadership in South Carolina<br />\nduring Reconstruction) makes a<br />\nsubstantial and original contribution to the field.\"<br />\nKea was originally appointed under a grant from the<br />\nRockefeller<br />\nFoundation, a<br />\n$600,000 grant to cover the<br />\ncont. on p. 2<br />\n<br />\nElections Results<br />\nRESULTS OF THE APRIL 21 RUN-OFF ELECTIONS<br />\nFOR CLASS OFFICES:<br />\n*CLASS OF '82 - total voting - 132 out of 513(26%)<br />\nRepresentative<br />\nRich BODEK - 65 - winner<br />\ntotal ballots - 123<br />\nJeff Goldstein - 49<br />\nBetsy NESSEN - 70 - winner<br />\n*CLASS OF '83 - total voting - 189 out of 568(33%)<br />\nSecretary<br />\nJim Pearlman -41<br />\ntotal ballots - 151<br />\nLise Ann SHEA'- 110- winner<br />\nTreasurer<br />\nDilip BARMAN - 93 - winner<br />\nFrank Ferraro - 77<br />\nRepresentative<br />\nHolly Robbins - 82<br />\nChester WAGSTAFF - 114 - winner<br />\nBruce WINTER - 108 - winner<br />\n<br />\ntotal ballots - 170<br />\n<br />\ntotal ballots - 173<br />\n<br />\n*CLASS OF '84- total voting -316 out of 609(52%)<br />\nPresident<br />\nMichael KUN - 162 - winner<br />\ntotal ballots - 293<br />\nMilton Simpson - 131<br />\n<br />\nVice-President<br />\nSean HUNKLER - 164 - winner<br />\nBruce Solitar - 102<br />\n<br />\ntotal ballots - 266<br />\n<br />\nSecretary<br />\nVeronique Bishop - 134<br />\nAndy KlERSTEAD - 158 - winner<br />\nRepresentative<br />\nDave Baker - 114<br />\nDoug Felltnan - 136<br />\nColin FLYNN - 141 - winner<br />\nCasie 1.1ASSFFR - 150 - winner<br />\nGary Kau - 106<br />\n\u2022 Carol PRES(()TT - 140 - v inner<br />\n<br />\ntotal ballots - 19,<br />\n<br />\ntotal ballots - 312<br />\n<br />\nRESULTS OF THE REFERENDUM<br />\nAND THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT:<br />\nReferendum<br />\nsupport - 335<br />\ndo not support - 237<br />\n<br />\ntotal ballots - 572<br />\n<br />\nConstitutional Amendment<br />\nsupport - 301<br />\ndo not supporr - 192<br />\n<br />\ntotal ballots - 493<br />\n<br />\n*CLASS OF '81 - total voting -26 out of 493(5%)<br />\n<br />\n_a<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2 / APRIL 24; 1981<br />\n<br />\nWomen Panelists Speak On Policy Formation<br />\nBY LINDSAY KAPLAN<br />\nA four-woman panel addressed female undergraduates<br />\nthis past Wednesday in \"An<br />\nEvening With Women in Public<br />\nPolicy,\" an event co-sponsored<br />\nby the Johns Hopkins Center for<br />\nMetropolitan Planning and Research and the Alumni Association.<br />\nDr. Katherine Lyall, principal research scientist at the<br />\nMetro Center and director of<br />\nHopkins' newly formed graduate<br />\nprogram in Public Policy, introduced the speakers and explained the purpose of the<br />\ndisucssiory panel. \"The idea for<br />\nthe program emerged from the<br />\n10th Alumnae Reunion,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"Many women expressed<br />\nan interest in knowing women in<br />\nthe Baltimore-Washington area<br />\nwho held public policy positions.\" She explained that the<br />\nspeakers had been invited to.<br />\nHopkins to give women here an<br />\nidea of the kinds of jobs they<br />\nhad, what it takes to get a job,<br />\nand the rewards and drawbacks.<br />\nof their posts.<br />\nThe panelists each held<br />\npositions representing different<br />\naspects of policy making.

As she<br />\ndescribed her career history<br />\nBoeckmann stressed that her job<br />\nchoices had been made subjectively: \"I stumbled on what I<br />\nenjoyed by eschewing what I<br />\ndidn't like.\"<br />\nThe major reward of her job<br />\n<br />\nwas that she was involved in<br />\n\"exciting, relevant research that<br />\nAll the<br />\nmay affect policy.<br />\nfrustrations stem from the fact<br />\nthat policies suggested are often<br />\nignored.\" She concluded by<br />\nsaying that being a good researcher and having political<br />\nsavvy were more important than<br />\none's sex, although she admitted<br />\nthat few women held high<br />\nfront-office jobs.<br />\nYeronia Jpsey, the newly<br />\nappointed Maryland parole commissioner, spoke next, presenting policy making from a state<br />\nShe<br />\nappointee's perspective.<br />\nemphasized the importance of<br />\ndeveloping general skills that<br />\nenable one to move from one<br />\nkind of problem or job to<br />\nanother.

A member of the<br />\nMaryland House of Delegates,<br />\nPerkins said she began her career<br />\nin volunteer work, where she<br />\nmet what later became a small<br />\nnetwork of women interested in<br />\npublic policy.

Mr. Campbell's<br />\nmethod of thinking is, I fear,<br />\ntypical of a flaw found in many<br />\nAmerican young people today.<br />\nThey look at the world we live<br />\nin, and see the many problems<br />\nwith which we are burdened;<br />\nthey feel the desire to do some4thing about them; and, therefore, they form groups like the<br />\nPSU to take action to solve these<br />\nproblems. This is, of course, a<br />\nlaudable undertaking, and I<br />\npraise Mr. Campbell and his<br />\nfellow PSU members for their<br />\nenergy.<br />\nUnfortunately, Mr.<br />\nCampbell and his friends go a<br />\nstep or two too far. In their<br />\nzeal to resolve our problems,<br />\nthey adopt what seems to them<br />\nto be the obvious, straightforward and most effective solution, and urge that solution<br />\nupon others. Often, however,<br />\nthis solution will have unanticipated and undesirable side effects, which are not considered<br />\nby those proposing it.<br />\nFor example, Mr. Campbell<br />\nspeaks of the absurdity of the<br />\n52,000 nuclear warheads possessed by the superpowers, and<br />\ndescribes the Trident submarine<br />\nprogram as ridiculous. I agree,<br />\nin that this money ideally should<br />\nbe spent for more socially<br />\nproductive purposes. But, in<br />\n'opposing programs such as the<br />\nTrident, Mr. Campbell makes the<br />\nmistake I spoke of above. True,<br />\nthe dismantling of these programs would greatly increase the<br />\nmoney available for social programs, and would without doubt<br />\nbe of some benefit to the poor<br />\nof this nation. But there are side<br />\neffects, having to do with the<br />\nexistence of a nation, as if not<br />\nmore powerful than ourselves,<br />\nwhich was founded and still is<br />\nbased upon a doctrine calling for<br />\nthe eventual elimination of ourselves and our form of governIf we followed Mr.<br />\nment.<br />\nCampbell's advice and stopped<br />\nbuilding nuclear weapons, problems of a far more serious nature<br />\nthan those we have today<br />\nwould follow, in short order.<br />\n<br />\nrocket engines of the mind. Progressive<br />\n<br />\nThis is not to say that mutual<br />\nattempts<br />\nreduction<br />\narms<br />\nshouldn't be made--they should.<br />\nBut we must bear in mind that<br />\nthe easiest solutions often have<br />\nthe most undesirable side effects.<br />\nA more realistic approach to<br />\nworld problems, then, is what<br />\nresponsible students should pursue. We must understand, first,<br />\nthat there are no simple answers,<br />\nand, second, that however good<br />\nour intentions, often there are<br />\nEl<br />\njust no answers at all.<br />\nSalvador is an example of this:<br />\nMr. Campbell accuses the Salvadoran government of killing fifty<br />\npeople per day (a strong possibility), and encourages our government to withdraw all American<br />\n<br />\naid. But this would not even<br />\nsolve the current problem--the<br />\nleftists now kill as many people<br />\nper day as the government, and<br />\nthe civil war which would<br />\nimmediately ensue if our aid<br />\nwere cut off would make fifty or<br />\none hundred deaths per day<br />\nseem trivial. What we must do is<br />\nnegotiate with the current government, and attempt to make it<br />\nmore liberal: but, if they do<br />\nnot listen, a cutoff of aid would<br />\nresult in even more bloodshed<br />\nthan there is now. In short,<br />\nthis is in all probability a no-win<br />\nsituation.<br />\nWhile I do object, and<br />\nstrenuously, to Mr. Campbell's<br />\nmethod of thinking, let me<br />\npraise him once again for taking<br />\nthe time to think at all. Far too<br />\nmany people in this country do<br />\nno think about the issues at all,.<br />\nexcept in a superficial and<br />\nlargely emotional manner. As<br />\nMr. Campbell says, we must \"get<br />\noff our asses\" and start to think<br />\nabout our problems; but, first,<br />\nlet us make certain that, in our<br />\nhaste to act, we do not oversimplify the problems that face<br />\nus.<br />\n<br />\nBrett Turner<br />\n<br />\nryA<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fP.M;E.'6./ A-1<br />\n)<br />\n.101:12_4 V984.<br />\n<br />\nHealth Service Forms Peer Counseling Group<br />\nBY JEAN PRESTON<br />\nHopkins students under the<br />\ndirection of Sue Gaintner of the<br />\nHealth Service have formed a<br />\npeer-education group to offer<br />\nadvice on contraceptives, sexually transmitted diseases, and<br />\nother sex-related matters. \"The<br />\nmain idea originally was to take<br />\nthe load off the midwives,\"<br />\nexplained member Mimi Bianchi.<br />\n\"Now the idea is to provide<br />\nsomeone to talk to who is your<br />\nown age, someone people may<br />\nfind less formidible than a<br />\nprofessional.\"<br />\n. \"There is a large number of<br />\nsexually active students who<br />\nneed help with birth control,\"<br />\naffirmed Mrs. Gaintner. \"Sometimes there are conflicts because<br />\nof the constraints of time for<br />\none-to-one counseling. We are<br />\nhoping that within the next<br />\nmonth the group will feel<br />\ncomfortable with talking about<br />\nthe choice of birth-control method and issues in reproduction.<br />\nThey are a well-motivated group,<br />\nenthusiastic and ready to go.\"<br />\nThe idea originated in an<br />\narticle which Mrs. Gaintner read<br />\nlast fall. She discussed it further<br />\nat a conference of the American<br />\nCollege Health Association, and<br />\nthen advertised for interested<br />\nstudents within the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. \"The program is<br />\nnot unique,\" she asserted. \"It's<br />\ntried and true. It exists on many<br />\nother campuses, and is fairly<br />\nwell accepted.\" Goucher College<br />\nand the University of Maryland<br />\nat College Park both sponsor<br />\nsimilar groups, while Planned<br />\n<br />\nParenthood actually has a clinic<br />\nat Towson State.<br />\nThe ten men and women<br />\nwho expressed interest in participating have undergone training<br />\nunder Mrs. Gaintner since the<br />\nbeginning of this semester.<br />\nSince most will return next year,<br />\nthey plan to make a major<br />\norganizational effort in the fall,<br />\nserving as the core of the group.<br />\nAt present only two members<br />\nhave experience in advising, one<br />\nfrom Planned Parenthood in<br />\nBaltimore and another from a<br />\nsimilar group in Princeton.<br />\nThe peer educators meet at<br />\n8:00 on Wednesday nights, and<br />\n<br />\nare available for conference<br />\non Thursday nights (Ob-Gyn<br />\nnights) at the Health Service.<br />\nStudents may make appointments to meet with members<br />\nwhen and where they wish, but<br />\nthe meeting room in the Health<br />\nOffice contains samples and<br />\nThe Health<br />\nvisual displays.<br />\nService offers contraceptives at<br />\ncost, free pregnancy testing and<br />\npelvic check-ups, and referrals to<br />\nabortion services in the city.<br />\nThe group hopes to serve<br />\nmainly as an intermediary between the students who opt to<br />\nuse it and the Health Service.<br />\nMrs. Gaintner feels that \"it is<br />\n<br />\nThey're going<br />\ntheir group.<br />\nto make it go.\" She takes<br />\nresponsibility for making sure<br />\nthat the group presents the<br />\nright information and fits the<br />\nstandards of the Health Service.<br />\nThe students are affiliated with<br />\nthe University only to the extent<br />\nthat they meet in the Health<br />\nOffice. Peer interviews are not<br />\nentered on a student's record.<br />\nMembers stressed that they<br />\nare open to everyone in the<br />\nHopkins community, whether<br />\nmale or female, sexually active<br />\nor not, teen or adult. Couples<br />\nare encouraged to visit together,<br />\nand can talk to another couple if<br />\n<br />\nthey wish.<br />\nBoth male and<br />\nfemale advisors are available.<br />\n\"It's just a matter of talking<br />\nabout sex factually, not as<br />\nsomething dirty or secret to be<br />\nhidden away,\" stated one member. Added another, \"It's not<br />\njust a matter of discussing<br />\nwhat is available, but also to<br />\nhelp you chose (a method of<br />\nbirth control) by what your sex<br />\nlife is like.\" She concluded,<br />\n\"We're just trying to provide<br />\nsomeone to turn to for information who will not be judgmental.

At one end lies the compulsive<br />\nplanner, the anal retentive who has plotted out<br />\nhis whole life, from grade school to retirement.<br />\nAt the other end is the procrastinator, who relies<br />\non fate and instinct to piece together his future.<br />\nIt is the range of possibilities between these<br />\ntwo extremes that is interesting to consider.<br />\nHow do people match vague ideals, goals, and<br />\nexpectations with real experiences in schools,<br />\njobs, and careers?<br />\nTwo forces appear to be at work. One is<br />\nthe need for security and well-being. Perhaps<br />\ncareful planning for the future in the form of a<br />\nstep-by-step sure-fire way to achieve individual<br />\ngoals is the best means of guaranteeing security.<br />\nThe second force is an urge to be flexible so that<br />\nchoices remain and one can change one's mind<br />\nin midstream, mid-academia, or mid-life.<br />\nFor peace of mind and contentment, a<br />\ncompromise between these two forces is necessary. As students attending a prestigious university we are at a point in our lives when we<br />\nmust begin to compromise. This is both a<br />\ncommon experience and a source of variation<br />\nfor us. While some young adults are just beginning to think of their future now, others are<br />\nnow finished thinking about the future because<br />\nit has already been well formed in their minds.<br />\nAfter random interviews with several<br />\nalumni I have perceived a marked similarity<br />\namong those who chose to spend several years of<br />\ntheir lives at Hopkins. Their concerns focus'on<br />\nthe realization or achievement of individual<br />\nlifetime goals. Perhaps it is success that we are<br />\nconsidering. Though I have no right to impose a<br />\npersonal definition of success, those alumni that<br />\nI have interviewed have achieved some degree of<br />\nsuccess, and have done so by balancing their<br />\nneeds for both security and flexibility.<br />\nLet's consider Eugene (Gene) Klavan, one<br />\nof the last media funny men around who did his<br />\nundergraduate work at Hopkins in the '40's. He<br />\ncame to Hopkins to major in political science,<br />\nmore specifically a \"pre-law,\" a decision that<br />\nwas made during high school; he had told an<br />\nadviser that he was interested in radio broadcasting and perhaps law. The adviser told him<br />\nto take the law path, and Hopkins was his first<br />\nstop on the road to the University of Maryland<br />\nLaw School. World War II began while he was in<br />\nlaw school, and Klavan left for the Army.<br />\nOnce he returned to the States, Klavan<br />\nwent to Chicago and took a job writing for a<br />\nmagazine, while at the same time auditioning for<br />\n<br />\na radio broadcasting position. Klavan later<br />\nreturned to Baltimore, took some English<br />\ncourses at the University of Maryland, and<br />\nfound a newscasting position with a local radio<br />\nstation. With the advent of television, he started<br />\nhis own humor show on what is now WJZ-TV.<br />\nAs a television pioneer, Klavan remembers that<br />\nhe was free to try almost anything he wanted,<br />\nand most of what he did was \"horrible\" because<br />\nof his lack of experience in working with the<br />\nnew media form.<br />\n\"Well, that lasted a whole fifteen weeks,\"<br />\naccording to Klavan, and he went to Washington<br />\nfor a short time to do another daily Ph hour<br />\ncomedy television show. Shortly after arriving<br />\nin New York for a WP1X-TV job, Klavan<br />\nswitched back to radio. He replaced Gene<br />\nRayburn on the Rayburn & Finch radio show;<br />\nthe partnership lasted 16 years and made him a<br />\nlocal household name. After nine more years of<br />\nsoloing, Klavan finally ended his reign as the<br />\nmost listened-to morning radio host in New<br />\nYork and went to WOR, where he still works<br />\neach afternoon, doing whatever he wants.<br />\nHow did he do it? This seems like too<br />\nperfect a story to be real: Hopkins grad wants<br />\nto be involved in radio, persists, and becomes<br />\nsuccessful, a well-known institution. He will<br />\nattest that persistence was the key to his<br />\nachievement. \"From my first job I fought for<br />\nmy freedom to do what I wanted,\" Klavan<br />\nexplains. H was always prepared to leave a<br />\nposition when this freedom was stifled.<br />\nKlavan's certainty that he would be able<br />\nto find a way to express himself through the<br />\nmedia stems from his \"I can do that\" attitude,<br />\nthe same force that prompted him to write<br />\n<br />\ntwo books during the last seven years. Klavan<br />\nhas \"never thought of himself as successful\"<br />\nand maintains that \"as you move along in life<br />\nyour goals continue to move with you to the<br />\nnext thing.\" He will never retire.<br />\nKlavan has done what he enjoys and what<br />\nhe does best and continues to receive the recognition of good audiences, from which he derives<br />\nhis \"drive and motivation.\" Klavan considers<br />\nhimself a \"creator\" whose goal has been to<br />\nsatisfy this urge.<br />\nGene Klavan's story may have some<br />\nnot-so-subtle ramifications for the someone who<br />\nis pondering his future. Faith in one's ability,<br />\npresistance in demanding the best possible<br />\nposition at a given time, and feeling secure<br />\nenough to preserve one's integrity and goals<br />\nseem to be the paths to Klavan's success. But it<br />\ncan't all be that simple.<br />\nDr. Eugene Sekulow did both his undergraduate and graduate work at Hopkins, and<br />\nthen taught here in the Political Science Department. For the past twenty one years Dr.<br />\nSekulow has worked at RCA in Manhattan, and<br />\ntoday is Executive Vice President for Corporate<br />\nAffairs.<br />\nDr. Sekulow has had two careers, and one<br />\nmajor difference between his position as a<br />\nprofessor at Hopkins and as an executive at RCA<br />\nis the size of his office. From his two-room<br />\nlayout on the 52nd floor of Rockefeller Center<br />\nin Manhattan a visitor is treated to a superb view<br />\nof all of the city. Sekulow is quick to say that<br />\n\"I can't say that business is more rewarding<br />\nthan academics,\" rather that the two are very<br />\ndifferent.<br />\nSekulow remembers that his decision to<br />\npursue an academic career was made while he<br />\nwas an undergraduate at Hopkins. However,<br />\nwhen RCA invited him to work in New York in<br />\n1960 he left, willing to experience a different<br />\ncareer and a very different lifestyle. Sekulow<br />\nremembers initially missing the slower pace and<br />\ngreater individuality of academia, but remained<br />\nat RCA while growing to appreciate the \"hectic<br />\nlife\" of big business.<br />\nThe two careers seem to have little in<br />\ncommon, but Sekulow's case provides proof that<br />\none person can succeed at both.<br />\nAlso,<br />\nSekulow's example reveals that career changes in<br />\nmidlife are possible, even when they involve<br />\nalterations in location and lifestyle. During the<br />\ncourse of a lifetime one can do two different<br />\nthings\u2014a comforting thought for those who<br />\ncan't decide between two options and those who<br />\nfear growing bored or frustrated in their initial<br />\nfield.'<br />\nCloser in age and perhaps experience to<br />\ntoday's Hopkins undergraduates is Stephen<br />\nMahinka, who graduated in 1974. Mahinka left<br />\nHopkins for Harvard Law School, worked for a<br />\nEugene Sekulow: Gilman to Rockefeller Center year in Massachusettes as a law clerk and has<br />\n<br />\n\fcollege-level textbooks. \"After working on a<br />\nChemistry textbook I realized that I didn't like<br />\nthe text department,\" Matthews remembers.<br />\nNext, she worked for several other publishing<br />\nhouses in their trade departments. According to<br />\nMatthews, \"Once you work with books, you see<br />\nhow you're not as impressed,\" and writing a<br />\nbook \"seems a more manageable task.\"<br />\n\"You'd be surprised at how bad some of<br />\nthe manuscripts 1 read were,\" remembers<br />\nMatthews, and she began to entertain the idea of<br />\nwriting her own book. Alternatives to 9-5 Jobs,<br />\npublished several years ago, was written and<br />\nresearched by Matthews while she was working<br />\nas an editor from 9-5. She says the work was<br />\ninspired by her personal interest in \"finding out<br />\nwhat people did to earn money while in school<br />\nor during vacations and free time.\" She explains, \"When you live that kind of flexible time<br />\nyou have a certain kind of freedom that when<br />\nyou're in a 9-5 job seems so appealing.\"<br />\nOnce the idea became more solidifed,<br />\nMatthews approached an agent, who liked it and<br />\ntold her to start working on it in earnest. The<br />\nresearch and writing took a year; Matthews<br />\nworked every night and weekend because she<br />\nkept her editing job. After the success of the<br />\nfirst book, Matthews is writing a second, and is<br />\nno longer working from 9-5.<br />\nFor those who have never written a book,<br />\nMatthews agrees that the task seems huge\u2014to the<br />\npcint of impossibility\u2014but contends that it can<br />\nbe accomplished with a little perseverance.<br />\nShe says it is much more fulfilling creating her<br />\nown original works rather than editing others'<br />\nMahinka's interest in policy making and manuscripts.<br />\nKathleen Matthews is don what she's<br />\npublic service is shown by his post-undergraduTrustee<br />\nYoung<br />\nate experiences. As a five-year<br />\nand now as a trust lawyer in a well-known firm,<br />\nhe believes that he is in a decision-making<br />\ncapacity. He places strong emphasis on his need<br />\nto continue in a career that requires the ability<br />\nto think. According to Mahinka, this talent was<br />\nimproved and reinforced first at Hopkins and<br />\nlater during law school. Mahinka maintains that<br />\nif \"you learn how to think and reason, and not<br />\njust how to hold information, then your career<br />\nchoices will not be limited from the start.\"<br />\nThe somewhat vague desire to enter the<br />\nbroad career area of public policy in order to<br />\nperform a public service has guided Mahinka.<br />\nHe appears to be heading towards a future that<br />\nsatisfies this goal. He maintains that a similar<br />\n\"non-delimiting\" choice of a flexible field<br />\ncan aid everyone. In this way the specific job or<br />\ncareer can remain flexible, while at the same<br />\ntime satisfying the need to feel as though one is<br />\nnot wasting time while starting \"at the bottom.\"<br />\nKathleen Matthews, also a 1971 graduate,<br />\nhas had a very different range of experiences<br />\nsince leaving school. As one of the first women<br />\nat Hopkins, Matthews remembers that her<br />\nexperience was \"not very typical at all,\" and \"in<br />\nsome ways feels not well qualified to speak of it<br />\nbecause it was very odd.\" Matthews remembers Mahinka: \"No one can expect to be the president<br />\nof a corporation immediately.\"<br />\nthat she was \"always interested in writing,\" an<br />\nsolidified<br />\nless<br />\nalways<br />\ninterest did not become more or<br />\nwanted to do, and is successful while<br />\ndoing<br />\nit.<br />\nShe endured jobs that were less interwhile an undergraduate.<br />\nMatthews<br />\nmajor,<br />\nesting<br />\na<br />\nIn fact, as Humanities<br />\nand spent a while finding out what she<br />\nreceived little career direction while a student. likes and dislikes.<br />\nfrom<br />\ngraduated<br />\nHoffman<br />\nShe attributes her lack of immediate worry<br />\nShepard<br />\nabout finding success and a career in part to the Hopkins in 1974 but has remained close to the<br />\ngeneral climate at the university during the early University, first as a Young Trustee, but also<br />\n1970's, and remembers that few of her friends because he resides in Charles Village. Hoffman<br />\nat Hopkins went to graduate school immediately left Hopkins after graduation and went to<br />\nafter graduation.

However, Hoffman says<br />\nthat at least for those interested in attending law<br />\nschool, \"There is a misinterpretation that there<br />\nis a better chance of getting into a better school<br />\nimmediately after college.\" Hoffman believes<br />\nthat it is a good idea to wait and experiment<br />\nwith various opportunities before entering a<br />\nprofessional program.<br />\nHoffman has stayed in Baltimore benuse<br />\nhe believes that as the city expands there will<br />\nbe numerous opportunities for him.

Farrar, Straus<br />\n& Giroux. $10.95.<br />\nLeonard Michaels is a visiting professor<br />\nin the Hopkins Writing Seminars.<br />\nIt is eerie to become suddenly<br />\ncognizant of a loss you are unaware of<br />\nhaving suffered. One of the many<br />\nstrengths of Leonard Michaels' first novel,<br />\nThe Men's Club, is that it forces the<br />\nrecognition of such a loss upon us. In<br />\nmodern life with movies, psychoanalysis,<br />\ntelevision, self-involvement and earning a<br />\nliving, the gift of story telling and the<br />\nstory as entertainment are lost. In The<br />\nMen's Club Michaels finds stories and tells<br />\nthem to us, in a modern setting. In<br />\nessence, he offers a modern equivalent, a<br />\nway back to the storytelling that we may<br />\nnot have realized we miss.<br />\nThe book begins: \"Women wanted to talk about anger, identity, politics,<br />\netc. I saw posters in Berkeley urging<br />\nthem to join groups.\" This is the perception of the narrator, a Berkeley professor,<br />\nas to what is in the topical air. When a<br />\nfriend calls to ask him to join a men's<br />\nclub his mind leaps to women's groups.<br />\nHis friend, a basketball player turned<br />\ncollege dean, responds: \"I'm talking<br />\nabout a men's club. Good Company.<br />\nYou talk about women's groups...Can't<br />\nyou hear me? A regular social possibility<br />\noutside our jobs and marriages.\"<br />\nThe narrator agrees to attend one<br />\nmeeting and the entire action of the book<br />\ntakes place during this one evening, when<br />\nthe men meet, in a house in the Berkeley<br />\n<br />\nflats. At first, anarchy reigns. The ideas<br />\nthe men have about what they want the<br />\nclub to be are as diverse as they are.<br />\nThe club includes, besides the narrator<br />\nand the dean: a real estate salesraan, a<br />\nlawyer, a doctor, a therapist and Paul,<br />\n\"the short marijuana man.\" Finally, the<br />\nmen decide to tell their life stories. A<br />\nwoman physically appears in the book<br />\nonly once, at the very end, but a myriad<br />\nof women appear in the stories of the<br />\nmen,as recalled by the narrator.<br />\n<br />\nAuthor Leonard Michaels<br />\nThe narrator acts as a host to the<br />\nreader, who arrives at the meeting with<br />\nhim and meets the other characters<br />\nthrough him. Later, as the characters<br />\nbecome more familiar, the narrator<br />\nrecedes, letting them speak directly to the<br />\nreader. The first chapter introduces the<br />\ncharacters and breaks the ice, while the<br />\nnarrator ruminates about the possibilities<br />\n<br />\nand purposes of a men's club. \"Men's<br />\nclubs. Women's groups. They suggest<br />\nI remembered<br />\nincurable disorders.<br />\nSocrates--how the boys, not his wife,<br />\nadored him. And Karl Marx running<br />\naround with Engels while Jenny stayed<br />\nhome with the kids. Maybe men played<br />\nmore than women. A men's club, compared to women's groups, was play.\" But<br />\nthe reader can empathize with this<br />\nfrustrated desire for play. The narrator<br />\nalso remarks: \"I lose over a month a year<br />\njust working to pay property taxes.<br />\nFriendship is a luxury.\"<br />\nThe book artfully renders, while<br />\nsatirizing, contemporary life. There are<br />\nlarge moments, times when one of the<br />\nmen finishes a story and the rest are<br />\nquiet. And there are small moments--as<br />\nmuch a part of life, after all, as the large<br />\nones. The men bicker. They all want to<br />\ntalk. They all urge each other to talk.<br />\nThe bond between the characters is not<br />\nimmediate; it grows slowly. Michaels<br />\ncreates the bond without calling attention<br />\nto it. The Men's Club is so entertaining<br />\nand well paced, the events so smoothly<br />\nrun together, that it is easy to miss how<br />\ncarefully each event and word is chosen<br />\nto produce this effect.<br />\nThe descriptions are clear, vivid,<br />\nand lively. Fully integrated, they become<br />\npart of the story. \"I saw the wallpaper<br />\nand a dish cabinet standing besides the<br />\nkitchen door. Old yellow pine. Brown<br />\nknots like birthmarks and a tall glass<br />\nfront. Deep shelves stacked with china<br />\nand knicknacks, tiny pink pigs and<br />\ndancing yokels. Porcelain sillies. It<br />\ndidn't suit decent old pine. Neither did<br />\n<br />\nthe wallpaper. In Kramer's house nothing<br />\nsuited anything and it all seemed chosen.\"<br />\nMichaels avoids the mistake<br />\nKramer makes in furnishing his house.<br />\nThe stories, action, the characters, are<br />\nperfectly suited, yet none of it seems<br />\nchosen. The stories lead gracefully, yet<br />\nconversationally, into each other. The<br />\nbook has the sound of a gathering\u2014<br />\nnatural, not staged.<br />\nThe night continues. The men tell<br />\nmore stories, many of which are about<br />\nwomen. Yet, it would be unfair to say<br />\nthat The Men's Club is about relationships between men and women. These<br />\nare the experiences of specific characters,<br />\nrather than a treatise on the state of<br />\nheterosexual relationships. The book is<br />\nrealistic, not propagandistic. Its achievement is not political, but splendidly<br />\nartistic.<br />\nThe book is about men together;<br />\nin The Men's Club, Michaels suggests<br />\nwhat men need from each other, what is<br />\npresent in their relationships with other<br />\nmen, and what is perhaps absent from<br />\ntheir relationships with women. He<br />\ndoesn't blurt it out. The reader discovers<br />\nit, feels it, as the men do, by listening to<br />\ntheir stories. In the same way,the reader<br />\nmay discover, as the men do, the importance of storytelling.<br />\n<br />\ncc')<br />\n<br />\nA Breath Of Life From Australia<br />\nseems to be little hope for them.

(\"This is not a gentleman's<br />\nsympathize with the three guerillas, there war any more,\" says Captain Hunt, whose<br />\n<br />\ndeath sparks the events which lead to the<br />\ntrial.) The message here is that a different ethos applies during wartime. In the<br />\nperpetual life-and-death environment of<br />\nall-out, no-holds-barred war, one must<br />\nadopt a cold-blooded pragmatism in order<br />\nto survive; in the secure domains of the<br />\ncivilized world, on the other hand,justice<br />\nmust be delivered, despite its repercussions.<br />\nOn a broader political scale, the<br />\nstory is quintessentially Australian. The<br />\nguerillas are marked for the firing squad<br />\nbecause they are Australians (dirty,<br />\nill-mannered, and uncouth) and thus<br />\nexpendable in the (proper, gentleman's)<br />\nEnglish army. The l'properness\" proves<br />\nto be just a disguise for contempt and<br />\nindifference to the colonials. The youngest of the three guerillas, George Witton<br />\n(Lewis Fitz-Gerald), is a victim of the<br />\nmystification of the United Kingdom; he<br />\noriginally volunteered in order to add his<br />\nsupport to the British Empire in which he<br />\nso strongly believed, and, when the<br />\nEmpire wrongly accuses him of murder,<br />\nhe tries to keep his sanity afloat by asking<br />\nhis comrades, \"Don't you believe in the<br />\nEmpire?\" The answer for Handcock<br />\n(Bryan Brown) is a flat \"no\"; he joined<br />\nthe Bushfeld Carbineers to escape the<br />\nAustralian depression and his creditors.<br />\nHandcock is a hard, proud, volatile, and<br />\nlusty character--the stereotypical Australian--and both Fitz-Gerald and Brown play<br />\ntheir roles entirely convincingly.<br />\ntitle<br />\ncharacter, Harry<br />\nThe<br />\n\"Breaker\" Morant (Edward Woodward),<br />\nis an unfathomably complex and fascinating man. A famed horsebreaker, selfexiled Englishman, poet, and soldier,<br />\nhe is a 19th-century Renaissance man<br />\nwho has become one of Australia's<br />\ngreatest folk heroes, and Woodward's<br />\nportrayal of the witty, sardonic Morant is<br />\nstrongly rendered.

A flaw in Breaker<br />\nMorant, though, is that, as in many<br />\ncourtroom dramas, the characters are<br />\nmuch seen but little developed.

LEWIS<br />\nIf you've always wondered what<br />\ncomputer music sounds like, you may be<br />\nin for a pleasant surprise: Peabody's<br />\nannual electronic and computer music<br />\nconcert will take place Sunday, May 2, at<br />\n8:00 p.m. in the Peabody concert hall.<br />\nIn addition to musical works created with<br />\nsynthesizers and tape recorders, this<br />\nyear's concert will feature the first<br />\npieces composed on Peabody's new<br />\ncomputer music synthesis system.<br />\nIncluded among the analog (noncomputer) pieces will be Vladimir<br />\nUssachevsky's \"Incidental Music to We,\"<br />\na radio play commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.<br />\nDr.<br />\n<br />\nUssachevsky is a recognized pioneer of<br />\nelectronic music and a founder of \"concrete music,\" a compositional philosophy<br />\nwhich adopts ordinary sonic events,<br />\nsuitably transformed, as the basis for<br />\nmusical composition.

Beresford exploits<br />\nthe outstanding images of the film to<br />\ntheir greatest effect (such as the raw<br />\ndynamism of the Carbineer horseman<br />\ngalloping across the veldt), and his camera<br />\nangles and shot compositions show a<br />\ncreative, albeit still not completely<br />\nrefined, talent. Although some of the<br />\ncuts are jumpy, Beresford is nevertheless<br />\nan excellent storyteller. The plot, an<br />\nunfolding of the truth about the rightness<br />\nor wrongness of Breaker Morant's actions,<br />\nadeptly shifts between past and present.<br />\nBreaker Murata, like other recent<br />\nofferings from Australia (The Last Wave,<br />\nPicnic at Hanging Rock) is an innovative<br />\nand challenging film.

A<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 21<br />\n<br />\nREFLECTIONS:<br />\nLacrosse Alumni And Hopkins<br />\nBY BOB ROSEN<br />\nSitting in his rowhouse<br />\napartment on Abell Avenue with<br />\nhis large Labrador retriever<br />\nnamed Buck, Les Matthews<br />\nrecalled his outstanding memory<br />\nof being a Blue Jay lacrosse<br />\nplayer in the early 70's.<br />\n\"Any coach is always looking for a way to give his players<br />\na little extra incentive before<br />\na big game. When Bob Scott was<br />\ncoaching, the thing that he<br />\nwould do was that on the Friday<br />\nafternoon practice, he would get<br />\nin the goal. He would take the<br />\nbest shooters on the team, and<br />\nhe'd take a glove and stuff it in<br />\nhis pants, and he'd put on a<br />\nhelmet, and he'd have a goalie<br />\nstick, and that's all. He'd get in<br />\nthe goal and let these guys shoot<br />\nthe ball as hard as they could at<br />\nhim. He'd come out of it with<br />\nwelts all over him, but he'd get<br />\nso keyed up trying to keep these<br />\nguys from scoring; it was a great<br />\nthing to get the team fired up.\"<br />\nA college team is never<br />\nstatic. Each year, the inevitable<br />\nturnover resulting from graduation creates an indelible change<br />\nin its makeup. In the past 30<br />\nyears countless lacrosse players<br />\nhave come and gone, leaving<br />\ntheir mark on Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nhistory. The Blue Jays have<br />\nrepeatedly had high eras and low<br />\nones; in the past three years<br />\nalone they have gone from a<br />\nmidfield-dominated team to a<br />\ndefense-oriented one to an attack-oriented one.<br />\n**************<br />\nWhen Emil Budnitz arrived<br />\nat Hopkins in the fall of 1949,<br />\none era was ending and another<br />\nbeginning. The Blue Jays, under<br />\nthe tutelage of the late W. Kelso<br />\nMorrill and featuring players<br />\nlike Jim Adams(now head coach<br />\nat Virginia) and Fred Smith,<br />\nrode the top of the lacrosse<br />\nworld. But when Budnitz joined<br />\nthe varsity the following year,<br />\nboth Morrill and most of the<br />\nstars were gone, beginning what<br />\nBudnitz called \"the lean years,\"<br />\nsix years of (for Hopkins),<br />\ncomparative mediocrity.<br />\nBut success would come for<br />\nBudnitz; 1951 was just the<br />\nbeginning of what was, and still<br />\nis, a long affiliation with the<br />\ngame. After spending two years<br />\nin military service, he went on to<br />\nplay 10 years with the Mount<br />\nWashington<br />\nLacrosse<br />\nClub,<br />\n\"where if we lost a game every<br />\ntwo years, people thought the<br />\nworld was coming to an end,\" at<br />\nthe same time helping to coach<br />\nat Loyola and Gilman High<br />\nSchools. He retired from the<br />\nfield in 1965, but remained on<br />\nthe sidelines as an assistant<br />\ncoach at JHU for nine years.<br />\nNor did his departure from<br />\nHopkins end his ties to the<br />\ngame--he is now both the commissioner of club lacrosse and<br />\nthe chairman of the World<br />\nLacrosse Games that will be<br />\nplayed at Hopkins next year.<br />\nHis honors have been numerous--twice All-America at attack,<br />\ntop lacrosse player of the<br />\nprevious 25 years as selected by<br />\nBaltimore magazine, and the<br />\nultimate honor, being inducted<br />\ninto the Lacrosse Hall of Fame.<br />\n<br />\n\"Lacrosse was very kind to<br />\nme,\" said Budnitz, \"and I think<br />\nin anything I participate in<br />\nin life, if something's been very<br />\nkind to me I ought to give back<br />\nto it, and that's why I coached<br />\nand why I'm still involved with<br />\nthe game at a different level. As<br />\nboth a player and a coach<br />\nat Hopkins I've been proud and<br />\npleased at being a part of the<br />\nHopkins tradition.\"<br />\nBetween his lacrosse commitments, Budnitz has spent 28<br />\nyears in the life insurance<br />\nbusiness and has written three<br />\nbooks on the subject.<br />\n**************<br />\nBob Scott's book Lacrosse<br />\ndescribes how a not-too-athletic<br />\n12-year-old, the waterboy of the<br />\n1950 championship team and<br />\nthe son of one of the great<br />\nnames in Blue Jay lacrosse, had<br />\nendlessly practiced hitting a ball<br />\nagainst a wall until his stickwork<br />\nwas superior to half of the<br />\nmembers of the nation's top<br />\ncollege team. It goes on to<br />\ndescribe how he went on to<br />\nbecome the game's sterling attackman from 1957 to 1959 as a<br />\nmember of a Blue Jay team that<br />\nhad regained its dominance of<br />\nthe lacrosse world under a new<br />\nhead coach, Bob Scott.<br />\nTime passes. Today there's<br />\na little gray around Bill Morrill,<br />\nJr.'s temples. He is the financial<br />\nvice-president of a construction<br />\ncompany. His two sons play<br />\nhigh school lacrosse at St. Paul's.<br />\nAnd Morrill believes nhat the<br />\ngame has changed so much that<br />\n\"our teams would get killed by<br />\ntoday's kids.\"<br />\n<br />\nlife. I can certainly look back<br />\non my college experience and<br />\nsay that they were the greatest<br />\nfour years of my life both in<br />\nmeeting individuals and experiences, and I would love to have<br />\nthe chance to do it all over<br />\nagain.\"<br />\nAfter the Morrill era ended,<br />\nHopkins was again relegated to<br />\nthe back seat as the Midshipmen<br />\nof Navy dominated the 60's,<br />\nwining or tying for a record<br />\neight consecutive national championships. Not even a star JHU<br />\nmidfielder<br />\nnamed<br />\nHenry<br />\nCiccarone could stem the tide.<br />\n\"What I remember most,\"<br />\nsaid Cowan, \"was when Navy<br />\ncame into Hopkins my sophomore year (1967). Navy had a<br />\n42-game winning streak at the<br />\ntime, and we beat Navy that<br />\nday, 9-6, in front of as many<br />\npeople as possibly could get into<br />\nHomewood Field. People were<br />\nstanding n top of the blackboards of the basketball courts<br />\nto try to get to see the game.\"<br />\nCowan enjoyed great success as an attackman at Hopkins,<br />\ntwice making All-America as the<br />\nJays finally dethroned Navy, but<br />\nhe holds equally high regard for<br />\nhis football career, during which<br />\nhe rewrote the Blue Jay rushing<br />\nrecords and was good enough to<br />\nbe drafted by the Colts.<br />\nThe Colts cut him, so<br />\nCowan went to work for his<br />\nfamily trucking business and<br />\nstarted a warehousing company<br />\nof which he is now president.<br />\nHe attributes his business success<br />\nin part to a lesson he learned as a<br />\nplayer at Hopkins: \"The team<br />\nthat wins is not necessarily the<br />\n<br />\nLes Matthews blocks a shot in an early 1973 contest against UB.<br />\n\"We were of the wooden- team with the greatest talent.<br />\nstick era,\" said Morrill.

During the<br />\nnext year, when we would be<br />\nbeating an opponent pretty<br />\nbadly, we would always be<br />\nyelling to go into a stall to<br />\nremind everybody of the way we<br />\nused to have to do it.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays finally won<br />\nthe NCAA playoffs in 1974, but<br />\nMatthews was no longer there.<br />\nInstead, he was playing in, of all<br />\nplaces, Texas, where he was<br />\nattending medical school. \"Here<br />\nI had been playing in the national championship game, and then<br />\nthree weeks down the road I was<br />\nin Houston playing lacrosse,<br />\nwhere you were lucky if you got<br />\nten guys out and nobody could<br />\npass or catch, by and large. It<br />\nwas kind of a shock at first, but<br />\nlacrosse is a small enough game<br />\nin terms of the number of<br />\nlocations and people who are<br />\ninvolved with it that it's sort of a<br />\nfraternal group. These were all<br />\npeople I enjoyed being with.<br />\n<br />\nship, Matthews said he was in<br />\n\"miserable\" physical shape, but<br />\nhe has now taken up longdistance running and competed<br />\nin the Maryland Marathon.<br />\n\"Once you get that jock mentality, it's hard to totally give it<br />\nup.\"<br />\nHe has been a fixture at thk<br />\nannual alumni-varsity game in<br />\nthe fall, a purely informal affair.<br />\n\"The alumni players' ability<br />\nalways get worse. Some of the<br />\nyounger alumni who are playing<br />\nclub lacrosse stay in good<br />\nlacrosse shape. There are some<br />\nguys who are in no kind of<br />\nshape. Then there are guys who<br />\nare staying in physical shape but<br />\njust pick up a lacrosse stick once<br />\na year, and obviously you can't<br />\nplay good lacrosse doing that.<br />\nAnd then every once in a while<br />\nsome guy will come along and go<br />\nout in that alumni game and<br />\nlook great, five or ten years after<br />\nhe's out of college; it's amazing.<br />\nWe'll say,'Where the hell was he<br />\nten years ago when we needed<br />\nhim?\"<br />\n**************<br />\nIf it hadn't been for an<br />\nunusual gesture from Henry<br />\nCiccarone, Dale Kohler might<br />\nhave gone down in Hopkins<br />\nannals as just another player<br />\nwho didn't quite make it.<br />\n\"In my sophomore year<br />\n(1974), expectations were quite<br />\nhigh that I would be on the<br />\nstarting midfield,\" he said. \"For<br />\none reason or another, my<br />\nperformance was less that what<br />\nwas expected, and I think I<br />\nended up the 13th midfielder<br />\nout of 13. I doubted my own<br />\nability at that point and even<br />\nconsidered transferring to Maryland. We played the Maryland<br />\nLacrosse Club in a scrimmage,<br />\nand I just got chewed up; I<br />\npacked up all my stuff and took.<br />\nit home. I got talked back into<br />\njust hanging around for the first<br />\ngame; we went down to play<br />\nVirginia and lost. Ciccarone<br />\npulled me aside after we got<br />\nback from Charlottesville and<br />\ntold me that he was going to give<br />\nme one more chance. He was<br />\ngoing to give me an opportunity<br />\nto play in the first midfield. He<br />\nfelt that I belonged on the field<br />\nas much as possible, and he was<br />\ngiving me this opportunity<br />\nagainst the wishes of the other<br />\ncoaches.\"<br />\nKohler not only started in<br />\nthat game but did so for the<br />\nremainder of the season and<br />\nbecame a first-team All-America<br />\nin the next two years under<br />\nCiccarone, who replaced Scott as<br />\nhead coach in 1975. But until<br />\nthe present dynasty began in<br />\n1978, it was a series of \"almosts\" for the Jays as Cornell<br />\nstepped to the top.<br />\nFor Kohler, finding himself<br />\nno longer a member of the Jays<br />\nafter graduating in '76 took<br />\nmore of an adjustment than for<br />\nmost.<br />\n<br />\n\"Over the next three years<br />\nwe developed a fairly decent<br />\nclub in Houston. By the time I<br />\nfinished school down there,<br />\nthere was respectable lacrosse<br />\nthroughout the state, nothing of<br />\nthe caliber out here, but still not<br />\nbad. Right before I left, the<br />\nculmination was that we took an<br />\n'all-star' team to New Orleans<br />\nand played an all-star team from<br />\nFlorida which was made up of<br />\nseveral Navy players who had all<br />\ngone down to Pensacola where<br />\nthey do their flight training.<br />\n(The Texans won.) So I had sort<br />\nof seen it go from nowhere to<br />\npretty good lacrosse.<br />\n\"I played midfield because<br />\nif a guy could pass and run and<br />\ncatch a little bit, they felt<br />\nlike you were wasted standing in<br />\nthe goal.\"<br />\nSo here was a man who had<br />\njust finished a stint as the<br />\nAll-America goalie for a national<br />\nchampionship contender playing<br />\nenthusiastically as a midfielder<br />\nfor a team that the Jays could<br />\nhave beaten with one arm tied<br />\nbehind their backs.<br />\nAfter finishing school in<br />\nKohler played one year for<br />\nHouston, Matthews returned to the Mt.

This<br />\nleaves vacancies in two Imograms: American History and<br />\nAtlantic History and Culture.<br />\nThe vacancy was created when<br /><br />\nCourse Guide Makes Revisions<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIn New Student Questionnaires<br />\nBY MITCHELL D. SMITH<br />\nThe Course Guide has revised , the questionnaire it<br />\ndistributes to students in order<br />\nto solicit more meaningful and<br />\naccurate evaluations of classes.<br />\nAccording to the editor Pam<br />\nHorn, many of the questions<br />\nhave been rewritten to insure<br />\nuniform responses from students.<br />\nIn past years, questions such<br />\nas the one dealing with the<br />\namount of time spent on a<br />\ncours.: have drawn varied responses because students would<br />\ninclude the number of class<br />\nhours. On the new questionnaire<br />\nthat will be distributed this<br />\nsemester, the question specifically asks for the number of hours<br />\noutside of class.<br />\nIn addition to wording<br />\nmany of the questions more<br />\nclearly, some new questions have<br />\nbeen added. A new section of<br />\nthe evaluation form deals with<br />\nthe course material and subject<br />\nmatter. This section was included because many students<br />\nhave included comments about<br />\nthe material on the questionnaires in the past. By including<br />\nspecific questions on the subject<br />\nmatter, the Course Guide staff<br />\nhopes to find out how the<br />\naverage student in a class, rather<br />\nthan those with special complaints, feels about the content<br />\nof the course.<br /><br />\nIn the past, the Course<br />\nGuide has received comments<br />\nfrom students questioning why<br />\nalmost all of the courses and<br />\nprofessors consistently receive<br />\nhigh grades.

Mr. Campbell's<br />\nmethod of thinking is, I fear,<br />\ntypical of a flaw found in many<br />\nAmerican young people today.<br />\nThey look at the world we live<br />\nin, and see the many problems<br />\nwith which we are burdened;<br />\nthey feel the desire to do some4thing about them; and, therefore, they form groups like the<br />\nPSU to take action to solve these<br />\nproblems. This is, of course, a<br />\nlaudable undertaking, and I<br />\npraise Mr. Campbell and his<br />\nfellow PSU members for their<br />\nenergy.<br />\nUnfortunately, Mr.<br />\nCampbell and his friends go a<br />\nstep or two too far. In their<br />\nzeal to resolve our problems,<br />\nthey adopt what seems to them<br />\nto be the obvious, straightforward and most effective solution, and urge that solution<br />\nupon others. Often, however,<br />\nthis solution will have unanticipated and undesirable side effects, which are not considered<br />\nby those proposing it.<br />\nFor example, Mr. Campbell<br />\nspeaks of the absurdity of the<br />\n52,000 nuclear warheads possessed by the superpowers, and<br />\ndescribes the Trident submarine<br />\nprogram as ridiculous. I agree,<br />\nin that this money ideally should<br />\nbe spent for more socially<br />\nproductive purposes. But, in<br />\n'opposing programs such as the<br />\nTrident, Mr. Campbell makes the<br />\nmistake I spoke of above. True,<br />\nthe dismantling of these programs would greatly increase the<br />\nmoney available for social programs, and would without doubt<br />\nbe of some benefit to the poor<br />\nof this nation. But there are side<br />\neffects, having to do with the<br />\nexistence of a nation, as if not<br />\nmore powerful than ourselves,<br />\nwhich was founded and still is<br />\nbased upon a doctrine calling for<br />\nthe eventual elimination of ourselves and our form of governIf we followed Mr.<br />\nment.<br />\nCampbell's advice and stopped<br />\nbuilding nuclear weapons, problems of a far more serious nature<br />\nthan those we have today<br />\nwould follow, in short order.<br /><br />\nrocket engines of the mind. Progressive<br /><br />\nThis is not to say that mutual<br />\nattempts<br />\nreduction<br />\narms<br />\nshouldn't be made--they should.<br />\nBut we must bear in mind that<br />\nthe easiest solutions often have<br />\nthe most undesirable side effects.<br />\nA more realistic approach to<br />\nworld problems, then, is what<br />\nresponsible students should pursue. We must understand, first,<br />\nthat there are no simple answers,<br />\nand, second, that however good<br />\nour intentions, often there are<br />\nEl<br />\njust no answers at all.<br />\nSalvador is an example of this:<br />\nMr. Campbell accuses the Salvadoran government of killing fifty<br />\npeople per day (a strong possibility), and encourages our government to withdraw all American<br /><br />\naid. But this would not even<br />\nsolve the current problem--the<br />\nleftists now kill as many people<br />\nper day as the government, and<br />\nthe civil war which would<br />\nimmediately ensue if our aid<br />\nwere cut off would make fifty or<br />\none hundred deaths per day<br />\nseem trivial. What we must do is<br />\nnegotiate with the current government, and attempt to make it<br />\nmore liberal: but, if they do<br />\nnot listen, a cutoff of aid would<br />\nresult in even more bloodshed<br />\nthan there is now. In short,<br />\nthis is in all probability a no-win<br />\nsituation.<br />\nWhile I do object, and<br />\nstrenuously, to Mr. Campbell's<br />\nmethod of thinking, let me<br />\npraise him once again for taking<br />\nthe time to think at all. Far too<br />\nmany people in this country do<br />\nno think about the issues at all,.<br />\nexcept in a superficial and<br />\nlargely emotional manner. As<br />\nMr. Campbell says, we must \"get<br />\noff our asses\" and start to think<br />\nabout our problems; but, first,<br />\nlet us make certain that, in our<br />\nhaste to act, we do not oversimplify the problems that face<br />\nus.<br /><br />\nBrett Turner<br /><br />\nryA<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nP.M;E.'6./ A-1<br />\n)<br />\n.101:12_4 V984.<br /><br />\nHealth Service Forms Peer Counseling Group<br />\nBY JEAN PRESTON<br />\nHopkins students under the<br />\ndirection of Sue Gaintner of the<br />\nHealth Service have formed a<br />\npeer-education group to offer<br />\nadvice on contraceptives, sexually transmitted diseases, and<br />\nother sex-related matters. \"The<br />\nmain idea originally was to take<br />\nthe load off the midwives,\"<br />\nexplained member Mimi Bianchi.<br />\n\"Now the idea is to provide<br />\nsomeone to talk to who is your<br />\nown age, someone people may<br />\nfind less formidible than a<br />\nprofessional.\"<br />\n. \"There is a large number of<br />\nsexually active students who<br />\nneed help with birth control,\"<br />\naffirmed Mrs. Gaintner. \"Sometimes there are conflicts because<br />\nof the constraints of time for<br />\none-to-one counseling. We are<br />\nhoping that within the next<br />\nmonth the group will feel<br />\ncomfortable with talking about<br />\nthe choice of birth-control method and issues in reproduction.<br />\nThey are a well-motivated group,<br />\nenthusiastic and ready to go.\"<br />\nThe idea originated in an<br />\narticle which Mrs. Gaintner read<br />\nlast fall. She discussed it further<br />\nat a conference of the American<br />\nCollege Health Association, and<br />\nthen advertised for interested<br />\nstudents within the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. \"The program is<br />\nnot unique,\" she asserted. \"It's<br />\ntried and true. It exists on many<br />\nother campuses, and is fairly<br />\nwell accepted.\" Goucher College<br />\nand the University of Maryland<br />\nat College Park both sponsor<br />\nsimilar groups, while Planned<br /><br />\nParenthood actually has a clinic<br />\nat Towson State.<br />\nThe ten men and women<br />\nwho expressed interest in participating have undergone training<br />\nunder Mrs. Gaintner since the<br />\nbeginning of this semester.<br />\nSince most will return next year,<br />\nthey plan to make a major<br />\norganizational effort in the fall,<br />\nserving as the core of the group.<br />\nAt present only two members<br />\nhave experience in advising, one<br />\nfrom Planned Parenthood in<br />\nBaltimore and another from a<br />\nsimilar group in Princeton.<br />\nThe peer educators meet at<br />\n8:00 on Wednesday nights, and<br /><br />\nare available for conference<br />\non Thursday nights (Ob-Gyn<br />\nnights) at the Health Service.<br />\nStudents may make appointments to meet with members<br />\nwhen and where they wish, but<br />\nthe meeting room in the Health<br />\nOffice contains samples and<br />\nThe Health<br />\nvisual displays.<br />\nService offers contraceptives at<br />\ncost, free pregnancy testing and<br />\npelvic check-ups, and referrals to<br />\nabortion services in the city.<br />\nThe group hopes to serve<br />\nmainly as an intermediary between the students who opt to<br />\nuse it and the Health Service.<br />\nMrs. Gaintner feels that \"it is<br /><br />\nThey're going<br />\ntheir group.<br />\nto make it go.\" She takes<br />\nresponsibility for making sure<br />\nthat the group presents the<br />\nright information and fits the<br />\nstandards of the Health Service.<br />\nThe students are affiliated with<br />\nthe University only to the extent<br />\nthat they meet in the Health<br />\nOffice. Peer interviews are not<br />\nentered on a student's record.<br />\nMembers stressed that they<br />\nare open to everyone in the<br />\nHopkins community, whether<br />\nmale or female, sexually active<br />\nor not, teen or adult. Couples<br />\nare encouraged to visit together,<br />\nand can talk to another couple if<br /><br />\nthey wish.<br />\nBoth male and<br />\nfemale advisors are available.<br />\n\"It's just a matter of talking<br />\nabout sex factually, not as<br />\nsomething dirty or secret to be<br />\nhidden away,\" stated one member. Added another, \"It's not<br />\njust a matter of discussing<br />\nwhat is available, but also to<br />\nhelp you chose (a method of<br />\nbirth control) by what your sex<br />\nlife is like.\" She concluded,<br />\n\"We're just trying to provide<br />\nsomeone to turn to for information who will not be judgmental.

At one end lies the compulsive<br />\nplanner, the anal retentive who has plotted out<br />\nhis whole life, from grade school to retirement.<br />\nAt the other end is the procrastinator, who relies<br />\non fate and instinct to piece together his future.<br />\nIt is the range of possibilities between these<br />\ntwo extremes that is interesting to consider.<br />\nHow do people match vague ideals, goals, and<br />\nexpectations with real experiences in schools,<br />\njobs, and careers?<br />\nTwo forces appear to be at work. One is<br />\nthe need for security and well-being. Perhaps<br />\ncareful planning for the future in the form of a<br />\nstep-by-step sure-fire way to achieve individual<br />\ngoals is the best means of guaranteeing security.<br />\nThe second force is an urge to be flexible so that<br />\nchoices remain and one can change one's mind<br />\nin midstream, mid-academia, or mid-life.<br />\nFor peace of mind and contentment, a<br />\ncompromise between these two forces is necessary. As students attending a prestigious university we are at a point in our lives when we<br />\nmust begin to compromise. This is both a<br />\ncommon experience and a source of variation<br />\nfor us. While some young adults are just beginning to think of their future now, others are<br />\nnow finished thinking about the future because<br />\nit has already been well formed in their minds.<br />\nAfter random interviews with several<br />\nalumni I have perceived a marked similarity<br />\namong those who chose to spend several years of<br />\ntheir lives at Hopkins. Their concerns focus'on<br />\nthe realization or achievement of individual<br />\nlifetime goals. Perhaps it is success that we are<br />\nconsidering. Though I have no right to impose a<br />\npersonal definition of success, those alumni that<br />\nI have interviewed have achieved some degree of<br />\nsuccess, and have done so by balancing their<br />\nneeds for both security and flexibility.<br />\nLet's consider Eugene (Gene) Klavan, one<br />\nof the last media funny men around who did his<br />\nundergraduate work at Hopkins in the '40's. He<br />\ncame to Hopkins to major in political science,<br />\nmore specifically a \"pre-law,\" a decision that<br />\nwas made during high school; he had told an<br />\nadviser that he was interested in radio broadcasting and perhaps law. The adviser told him<br />\nto take the law path, and Hopkins was his first<br />\nstop on the road to the University of Maryland<br />\nLaw School. World War II began while he was in<br />\nlaw school, and Klavan left for the Army.<br />\nOnce he returned to the States, Klavan<br />\nwent to Chicago and took a job writing for a<br />\nmagazine, while at the same time auditioning for<br /><br />\na radio broadcasting position. Klavan later<br />\nreturned to Baltimore, took some English<br />\ncourses at the University of Maryland, and<br />\nfound a newscasting position with a local radio<br />\nstation. With the advent of television, he started<br />\nhis own humor show on what is now WJZ-TV.<br />\nAs a television pioneer, Klavan remembers that<br />\nhe was free to try almost anything he wanted,<br />\nand most of what he did was \"horrible\" because<br />\nof his lack of experience in working with the<br />\nnew media form.<br />\n\"Well, that lasted a whole fifteen weeks,\"<br />\naccording to Klavan, and he went to Washington<br />\nfor a short time to do another daily Ph hour<br />\ncomedy television show. Shortly after arriving<br />\nin New York for a WP1X-TV job, Klavan<br />\nswitched back to radio. He replaced Gene<br />\nRayburn on the Rayburn &amp; Finch radio show;<br />\nthe partnership lasted 16 years and made him a<br />\nlocal household name. After nine more years of<br />\nsoloing, Klavan finally ended his reign as the<br />\nmost listened-to morning radio host in New<br />\nYork and went to WOR, where he still works<br />\neach afternoon, doing whatever he wants.<br />\nHow did he do it? This seems like too<br />\nperfect a story to be real: Hopkins grad wants<br />\nto be involved in radio, persists, and becomes<br />\nsuccessful, a well-known institution. He will<br />\nattest that persistence was the key to his<br />\nachievement. \"From my first job I fought for<br />\nmy freedom to do what I wanted,\" Klavan<br />\nexplains. H was always prepared to leave a<br />\nposition when this freedom was stifled.<br />\nKlavan's certainty that he would be able<br />\nto find a way to express himself through the<br />\nmedia stems from his \"I can do that\" attitude,<br />\nthe same force that prompted him to write<br /><br />\ntwo books during the last seven years. Klavan<br />\nhas \"never thought of himself as successful\"<br />\nand maintains that \"as you move along in life<br />\nyour goals continue to move with you to the<br />\nnext thing.\" He will never retire.<br />\nKlavan has done what he enjoys and what<br />\nhe does best and continues to receive the recognition of good audiences, from which he derives<br />\nhis \"drive and motivation.\" Klavan considers<br />\nhimself a \"creator\" whose goal has been to<br />\nsatisfy this urge.<br />\nGene Klavan's story may have some<br />\nnot-so-subtle ramifications for the someone who<br />\nis pondering his future. Faith in one's ability,<br />\npresistance in demanding the best possible<br />\nposition at a given time, and feeling secure<br />\nenough to preserve one's integrity and goals<br />\nseem to be the paths to Klavan's success. But it<br />\ncan't all be that simple.<br />\nDr. Eugene Sekulow did both his undergraduate and graduate work at Hopkins, and<br />\nthen taught here in the Political Science Department. For the past twenty one years Dr.<br />\nSekulow has worked at RCA in Manhattan, and<br />\ntoday is Executive Vice President for Corporate<br />\nAffairs.<br />\nDr. Sekulow has had two careers, and one<br />\nmajor difference between his position as a<br />\nprofessor at Hopkins and as an executive at RCA<br />\nis the size of his office. From his two-room<br />\nlayout on the 52nd floor of Rockefeller Center<br />\nin Manhattan a visitor is treated to a superb view<br />\nof all of the city. Sekulow is quick to say that<br />\n\"I can't say that business is more rewarding<br />\nthan academics,\" rather that the two are very<br />\ndifferent.<br />\nSekulow remembers that his decision to<br />\npursue an academic career was made while he<br />\nwas an undergraduate at Hopkins. However,<br />\nwhen RCA invited him to work in New York in<br />\n1960 he left, willing to experience a different<br />\ncareer and a very different lifestyle. Sekulow<br />\nremembers initially missing the slower pace and<br />\ngreater individuality of academia, but remained<br />\nat RCA while growing to appreciate the \"hectic<br />\nlife\" of big business.<br />\nThe two careers seem to have little in<br />\ncommon, but Sekulow's case provides proof that<br />\none person can succeed at both.<br />\nAlso,<br />\nSekulow's example reveals that career changes in<br />\nmidlife are possible, even when they involve<br />\nalterations in location and lifestyle. During the<br />\ncourse of a lifetime one can do two different<br />\nthings\u2014a comforting thought for those who<br />\ncan't decide between two options and those who<br />\nfear growing bored or frustrated in their initial<br />\nfield.'<br />\nCloser in age and perhaps experience to<br />\ntoday's Hopkins undergraduates is Stephen<br />\nMahinka, who graduated in 1974. Mahinka left<br />\nHopkins for Harvard Law School, worked for a<br />\nEugene Sekulow: Gilman to Rockefeller Center year in Massachusettes as a law clerk and has<br /><br />\ncollege-level textbooks. \"After working on a<br />\nChemistry textbook I realized that I didn't like<br />\nthe text department,\" Matthews remembers.<br />\nNext, she worked for several other publishing<br />\nhouses in their trade departments. According to<br />\nMatthews, \"Once you work with books, you see<br />\nhow you're not as impressed,\" and writing a<br />\nbook \"seems a more manageable task.\"<br />\n\"You'd be surprised at how bad some of<br />\nthe manuscripts 1 read were,\" remembers<br />\nMatthews, and she began to entertain the idea of<br />\nwriting her own book. Alternatives to 9-5 Jobs,<br />\npublished several years ago, was written and<br />\nresearched by Matthews while she was working<br />\nas an editor from 9-5. She says the work was<br />\ninspired by her personal interest in \"finding out<br />\nwhat people did to earn money while in school<br />\nor during vacations and free time.\" She explains, \"When you live that kind of flexible time<br />\nyou have a certain kind of freedom that when<br />\nyou're in a 9-5 job seems so appealing.\"<br />\nOnce the idea became more solidifed,<br />\nMatthews approached an agent, who liked it and<br />\ntold her to start working on it in earnest. The<br />\nresearch and writing took a year; Matthews<br />\nworked every night and weekend because she<br />\nkept her editing job. After the success of the<br />\nfirst book, Matthews is writing a second, and is<br />\nno longer working from 9-5.<br />\nFor those who have never written a book,<br />\nMatthews agrees that the task seems huge\u2014to the<br />\npcint of impossibility\u2014but contends that it can<br />\nbe accomplished with a little perseverance.<br />\nShe says it is much more fulfilling creating her<br />\nown original works rather than editing others'<br />\nMahinka's interest in policy making and manuscripts.<br />\nKathleen Matthews is don what she's<br />\npublic service is shown by his post-undergraduTrustee<br />\nYoung<br />\nate experiences. As a five-year<br />\nand now as a trust lawyer in a well-known firm,<br />\nhe believes that he is in a decision-making<br />\ncapacity. He places strong emphasis on his need<br />\nto continue in a career that requires the ability<br />\nto think. According to Mahinka, this talent was<br />\nimproved and reinforced first at Hopkins and<br />\nlater during law school. Mahinka maintains that<br />\nif \"you learn how to think and reason, and not<br />\njust how to hold information, then your career<br />\nchoices will not be limited from the start.\"<br />\nThe somewhat vague desire to enter the<br />\nbroad career area of public policy in order to<br />\nperform a public service has guided Mahinka.<br />\nHe appears to be heading towards a future that<br />\nsatisfies this goal. He maintains that a similar<br />\n\"non-delimiting\" choice of a flexible field<br />\ncan aid everyone. In this way the specific job or<br />\ncareer can remain flexible, while at the same<br />\ntime satisfying the need to feel as though one is<br />\nnot wasting time while starting \"at the bottom.\"<br />\nKathleen Matthews, also a 1971 graduate,<br />\nhas had a very different range of experiences<br />\nsince leaving school. As one of the first women<br />\nat Hopkins, Matthews remembers that her<br />\nexperience was \"not very typical at all,\" and \"in<br />\nsome ways feels not well qualified to speak of it<br />\nbecause it was very odd.\" Matthews remembers Mahinka: \"No one can expect to be the president<br />\nof a corporation immediately.\"<br />\nthat she was \"always interested in writing,\" an<br />\nsolidified<br />\nless<br />\nalways<br />\ninterest did not become more or<br />\nwanted to do, and is successful while<br />\ndoing<br />\nit.<br />\nShe endured jobs that were less interwhile an undergraduate.<br />\nMatthews<br />\nmajor,<br />\nesting<br />\na<br />\nIn fact, as Humanities<br />\nand spent a while finding out what she<br />\nreceived little career direction while a student. likes and dislikes.<br />\nfrom<br />\ngraduated<br />\nHoffman<br />\nShe attributes her lack of immediate worry<br />\nShepard<br />\nabout finding success and a career in part to the Hopkins in 1974 but has remained close to the<br />\ngeneral climate at the university during the early University, first as a Young Trustee, but also<br />\n1970's, and remembers that few of her friends because he resides in Charles Village. Hoffman<br />\nat Hopkins went to graduate school immediately left Hopkins after graduation and went to<br />\nafter graduation. Instead, most traveled for a Boston University Law School, not because he<br />\nwhile, or found a job in a part of the country had always planned to attend law school, but<br />\nthat seemed interesting. The more relaxed, less because none of the fellowships and grants he<br />\npre-professional atmosphere at Hopkins did not applied for came through. After his first year,<br />\nmean that undergraduates weren't interested in though, Hoffman left for the Phillipines for a<br />\nprofessional careers, rather that more students year on a Henry Luce Fellowship designed to<br />\nfelt less hurried about deciding what to do with \"acquaint young Americans with societies in<br />\nthe rest of their lives.<br />\nAsia.\" Hoffman returned to Boston to complete<br />\nWhen Matthews left Hopkins she went to law school and after graduation worked on<br />\nWashington and initially worked for a lobbying Congressman Jim Shannon's campaign during<br />\ngroup.

After the<br />\nsince been employed by the firm of Morgan,<br />\nLewis and Bachius in its Washington office.<br />\nMahinka chose the law school route<br />\nduring his senior year at Hopkins after deciding<br />\nthat the opportunities in teaching were limited<br />\nand declining due to the decrease in the number<br />\nof college-age youths. He also believed that<br />\ngiven his personality and desire to find a career<br />\nthat would grant \"intellectual stimulation\" and<br />\nan opportunity to \"influence public policy and<br />\npractical service,\" a law degree would suit his<br />\nneeds best.<br />\nMahinka maintains that having spent most<br />\nof his working life as a lawyer at one firm<br />\ndoesn't mean that he will always be at that firm,<br />\nor always practice law. He believes that he<br />\nstill has numerous options for other jobs, in<br />\ngovernment or business for example.<br />\nAccording to Mahinka, \"The problem<br />\nwith many students is that they feel that the<br />\nchoices the make during their junior and senior<br />\nyears at college must be life choices.\" Mahinka<br />\nwarns against making \"delimiting choices\" and<br />\ninstead advises choosing fields that have flexibility, but\u2014most importantly\u2014seem interesting and<br />\nenjoyable.<br />\n\"Today, the current concern is for jobs,\"<br />\nbut the \"attitude shouldn't be such that a career<br />\nor field is chosen because it has a good future.\"<br />\nMahinka believes that as young adults enter<br />\nthe full-time working world they \"should not<br />\nlimit themselves with narrow career preparation.\" \"No one,\" Mahinka explains,\"can expect<br />\nto be the president of a corporation immediate,<br />\nly.<br /><br />\nKathleen Matthews<br />\nAuthor of Alternatives to 9-5 Jobs<br />\nelection, Carter named Hoffman to his Special<br />\nCouncil to the Secretary of Labor, where he<br />\nworked during the government transition until<br />\nJanuary 20, when the Reagan Administration<br />\ntook office. Hoffman is currently working for a<br />\nsmall Baltimore law firm where he specializes in<br />\nlabor law.<br />\nHoffman believes that the degree of<br />\nflexibility that can be maintained while developing a career depends largely on one's \"demand<br />\nfor a standard of living.\" Those who wish to<br />\nexperiment with various jobs and locations must<br />\nbe willing to compromise on the level of their<br />\nstandard of living and the corresponding degree<br />\nof financial security. However, Hoffman says<br />\nthat at least for those interested in attending law<br />\nschool, \"There is a misinterpretation that there<br />\nis a better chance of getting into a better school<br />\nimmediately after college.\" Hoffman believes<br />\nthat it is a good idea to wait and experiment<br />\nwith various opportunities before entering a<br />\nprofessional program.<br />\nHoffman has stayed in Baltimore benuse<br />\nhe believes that as the city expands there will<br />\nbe numerous opportunities for him. He says<br />\nthat he is happy with his current job because<br />\nhe is given more room for initiative because the<br />\nlaw firm is a small one. Because his working<br />\ndays are long and because he spends some of his<br />\nweekend time working, Hoffman says, it is<br />\nessential that he enjoy what he does. Like<br />\nStephen Mahinka, Hoffman does not believe<br />\nthat because he is currently practicing law he will<br />\nalways do so.<br />\nHowever encouraging these alumni character sketches may be, it is still up to each<br />\nperson to find his own solution to the problem<br />\nof making post-graduation career choices.<br />\nAlthough it may seem that you are the only one<br />\non campus without a specific game plan that<br />\nguarantees success and stability, rest assured that<br />\nthere are indecisive people in abundance.<br />\nOne graduating senior who has been<br />\naccepted to the professional school of his choice<br />\nwas quick to admit that his \"peace of mind\"<br />\nover his future was accompanied by a \"lockedin\" feeling, but was generally pleased with the<br />\nresults of four years of hard work at Hopkins.<br />\nAnother senior said that \"while (she) wished<br />\n(she) knew what to do next,(she) certainly did<br />\nnot feel trapped.\" At the same time this senior<br />\nadmitted that her lack of direction gave her \"no<br />\nsense of myself,\" and that she wished she had a<br />\nconcrete goal, \"something (she) could concentrate (her) energies on.\"<br />\nThese personal accounts are just<br />\nthat\u2014personal\u2014and the feelings of young adults<br />\nvary widely. It's hard to find a moral to all<br />\nthese stories, but perhaps what stands out most<br />\nis Gene Klavan's comment about his \"I can do<br />\nthat\" attitude, and his reluctance to compromise<br />\nand to less than he is able to.<br />\nBut if worst comes to worst, one can<br />\nfollow the ultimate advice of another Hopkins<br />\nsenior: \"And if nothing else, I could always<br />\nbullshit.\"<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 I APRIL 24,1981<br />\n00110.1.01.0.,<br /><br />\nSenior Class Film Series Presents<br /><br />\nwAte<br />\nfr wned<br />\nbewd Gloria<br />\nto hide her son<br />\nfrom the mob.<br />\n10 minutes later<br />\nthe boy was<br />\nan orphan.<br />\nNow they want<br />\nthe boy dead too.<br />\nBut first.they'll<br />\nhave to deal with<br />\nGloria.<br /><br />\nCKLMIAA PIC TOPES<br />\nPnnents<br />\n\u2022,OHN CASSAY(115<br /><br />\nNDs<br /><br />\nGENA<br />\nGLORIA<br />\nMusAb,SIL1 COMM<br />\nPooch.. by SAM SHAW<br />\nWnropr.

Farrar, Straus<br />\n&amp; Giroux. $10.95.<br />\nLeonard Michaels is a visiting professor<br />\nin the Hopkins Writing Seminars.<br />\nIt is eerie to become suddenly<br />\ncognizant of a loss you are unaware of<br />\nhaving suffered. One of the many<br />\nstrengths of Leonard Michaels' first novel,<br />\nThe Men's Club, is that it forces the<br />\nrecognition of such a loss upon us. In<br />\nmodern life with movies, psychoanalysis,<br />\ntelevision, self-involvement and earning a<br />\nliving, the gift of story telling and the<br />\nstory as entertainment are lost. In The<br />\nMen's Club Michaels finds stories and tells<br />\nthem to us, in a modern setting. In<br />\nessence, he offers a modern equivalent, a<br />\nway back to the storytelling that we may<br />\nnot have realized we miss.<br />\nThe book begins: \"Women wanted to talk about anger, identity, politics,<br />\netc. I saw posters in Berkeley urging<br />\nthem to join groups.\" This is the perception of the narrator, a Berkeley professor,<br />\nas to what is in the topical air. When a<br />\nfriend calls to ask him to join a men's<br />\nclub his mind leaps to women's groups.<br />\nHis friend, a basketball player turned<br />\ncollege dean, responds: \"I'm talking<br />\nabout a men's club. Good Company.<br />\nYou talk about women's groups...Can't<br />\nyou hear me? A regular social possibility<br />\noutside our jobs and marriages.\"<br />\nThe narrator agrees to attend one<br />\nmeeting and the entire action of the book<br />\ntakes place during this one evening, when<br />\nthe men meet, in a house in the Berkeley<br /><br />\nflats. At first, anarchy reigns. The ideas<br />\nthe men have about what they want the<br />\nclub to be are as diverse as they are.<br />\nThe club includes, besides the narrator<br />\nand the dean: a real estate salesraan, a<br />\nlawyer, a doctor, a therapist and Paul,<br />\n\"the short marijuana man.\" Finally, the<br />\nmen decide to tell their life stories. A<br />\nwoman physically appears in the book<br />\nonly once, at the very end, but a myriad<br />\nof women appear in the stories of the<br />\nmen,as recalled by the narrator.<br /><br />\nAuthor Leonard Michaels<br />\nThe narrator acts as a host to the<br />\nreader, who arrives at the meeting with<br />\nhim and meets the other characters<br />\nthrough him. Later, as the characters<br />\nbecome more familiar, the narrator<br />\nrecedes, letting them speak directly to the<br />\nreader. The first chapter introduces the<br />\ncharacters and breaks the ice, while the<br />\nnarrator ruminates about the possibilities<br /><br />\nand purposes of a men's club. \"Men's<br />\nclubs. Women's groups. They suggest<br />\nI remembered<br />\nincurable disorders.<br />\nSocrates--how the boys, not his wife,<br />\nadored him. And Karl Marx running<br />\naround with Engels while Jenny stayed<br />\nhome with the kids. Maybe men played<br />\nmore than women. A men's club, compared to women's groups, was play.\" But<br />\nthe reader can empathize with this<br />\nfrustrated desire for play. The narrator<br />\nalso remarks: \"I lose over a month a year<br />\njust working to pay property taxes.<br />\nFriendship is a luxury.\"<br />\nThe book artfully renders, while<br />\nsatirizing, contemporary life. There are<br />\nlarge moments, times when one of the<br />\nmen finishes a story and the rest are<br />\nquiet. And there are small moments--as<br />\nmuch a part of life, after all, as the large<br />\nones. The men bicker. They all want to<br />\ntalk. They all urge each other to talk.<br />\nThe bond between the characters is not<br />\nimmediate; it grows slowly. Michaels<br />\ncreates the bond without calling attention<br />\nto it. The Men's Club is so entertaining<br />\nand well paced, the events so smoothly<br />\nrun together, that it is easy to miss how<br />\ncarefully each event and word is chosen<br />\nto produce this effect.<br />\nThe descriptions are clear, vivid,<br />\nand lively. Fully integrated, they become<br />\npart of the story. \"I saw the wallpaper<br />\nand a dish cabinet standing besides the<br />\nkitchen door. Old yellow pine. Brown<br />\nknots like birthmarks and a tall glass<br />\nfront. Deep shelves stacked with china<br />\nand knicknacks, tiny pink pigs and<br />\ndancing yokels. Porcelain sillies.

The stories lead gracefully, yet<br />\nconversationally, into each other. The<br />\nbook has the sound of a gathering\u2014<br />\nnatural, not staged.<br />\nThe night continues. The men tell<br />\nmore stories, many of which are about<br />\nwomen. Yet, it would be unfair to say<br />\nthat The Men's Club is about relationships between men and women. These<br />\nare the experiences of specific characters,<br />\nrather than a treatise on the state of<br />\nheterosexual relationships. The book is<br />\nrealistic, not propagandistic. Its achievement is not political, but splendidly<br />\nartistic.<br />\nThe book is about men together;<br />\nin The Men's Club, Michaels suggests<br />\nwhat men need from each other, what is<br />\npresent in their relationships with other<br />\nmen, and what is perhaps absent from<br />\ntheir relationships with women. He<br />\ndoesn't blurt it out. The reader discovers<br />\nit, feels it, as the men do, by listening to<br />\ntheir stories. In the same way,the reader<br />\nmay discover, as the men do, the importance of storytelling.<br /><br />\ncc')<br /><br />\nA Breath Of Life From Australia<br />\nseems to be little hope for them.

(\"This is not a gentleman's<br />\nsympathize with the three guerillas, there war any more,\" says Captain Hunt, whose<br /><br />\ndeath sparks the events which lead to the<br />\ntrial.) The message here is that a different ethos applies during wartime. In the<br />\nperpetual life-and-death environment of<br />\nall-out, no-holds-barred war, one must<br />\nadopt a cold-blooded pragmatism in order<br />\nto survive; in the secure domains of the<br />\ncivilized world, on the other hand,justice<br />\nmust be delivered, despite its repercussions.<br />\nOn a broader political scale, the<br />\nstory is quintessentially Australian. The<br />\nguerillas are marked for the firing squad<br />\nbecause they are Australians (dirty,<br />\nill-mannered, and uncouth) and thus<br />\nexpendable in the (proper, gentleman's)<br />\nEnglish army. The l'properness\" proves<br />\nto be just a disguise for contempt and<br />\nindifference to the colonials. The youngest of the three guerillas, George Witton<br />\n(Lewis Fitz-Gerald), is a victim of the<br />\nmystification of the United Kingdom; he<br />\noriginally volunteered in order to add his<br />\nsupport to the British Empire in which he<br />\nso strongly believed, and, when the<br />\nEmpire wrongly accuses him of murder,<br />\nhe tries to keep his sanity afloat by asking<br />\nhis comrades, \"Don't you believe in the<br />\nEmpire?\" The answer for Handcock<br />\n(Bryan Brown) is a flat \"no\"; he joined<br />\nthe Bushfeld Carbineers to escape the<br />\nAustralian depression and his creditors.<br />\nHandcock is a hard, proud, volatile, and<br />\nlusty character--the stereotypical Australian--and both Fitz-Gerald and Brown play<br />\ntheir roles entirely convincingly.<br />\ntitle<br />\ncharacter, Harry<br />\nThe<br />\n\"Breaker\" Morant (Edward Woodward),<br />\nis an unfathomably complex and fascinating man.

Beresford exploits<br />\nthe outstanding images of the film to<br />\ntheir greatest effect (such as the raw<br />\ndynamism of the Carbineer horseman<br />\ngalloping across the veldt), and his camera<br />\nangles and shot compositions show a<br />\ncreative, albeit still not completely<br />\nrefined, talent. Although some of the<br />\ncuts are jumpy, Beresford is nevertheless<br />\nan excellent storyteller.

A<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 21<br /><br />\nREFLECTIONS:<br />\nLacrosse Alumni And Hopkins<br />\nBY BOB ROSEN<br />\nSitting in his rowhouse<br />\napartment on Abell Avenue with<br />\nhis large Labrador retriever<br />\nnamed Buck, Les Matthews<br />\nrecalled his outstanding memory<br />\nof being a Blue Jay lacrosse<br />\nplayer in the early 70's.<br />\n\"Any coach is always looking for a way to give his players<br />\na little extra incentive before<br />\na big game. When Bob Scott was<br />\ncoaching, the thing that he<br />\nwould do was that on the Friday<br />\nafternoon practice, he would get<br />\nin the goal. He would take the<br />\nbest shooters on the team, and<br />\nhe'd take a glove and stuff it in<br />\nhis pants, and he'd put on a<br />\nhelmet, and he'd have a goalie<br />\nstick, and that's all. He'd get in<br />\nthe goal and let these guys shoot<br />\nthe ball as hard as they could at<br />\nhim. He'd come out of it with<br />\nwelts all over him, but he'd get<br />\nso keyed up trying to keep these<br />\nguys from scoring; it was a great<br />\nthing to get the team fired up.\"<br />\nA college team is never<br />\nstatic. Each year, the inevitable<br />\nturnover resulting from graduation creates an indelible change<br />\nin its makeup. In the past 30<br />\nyears countless lacrosse players<br />\nhave come and gone, leaving<br />\ntheir mark on Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nhistory. The Blue Jays have<br />\nrepeatedly had high eras and low<br />\nones; in the past three years<br />\nalone they have gone from a<br />\nmidfield-dominated team to a<br />\ndefense-oriented one to an attack-oriented one.<br />\n**************<br />\nWhen Emil Budnitz arrived<br />\nat Hopkins in the fall of 1949,<br />\none era was ending and another<br />\nbeginning. The Blue Jays, under<br />\nthe tutelage of the late W. Kelso<br />\nMorrill and featuring players<br />\nlike Jim Adams(now head coach<br />\nat Virginia) and Fred Smith,<br />\nrode the top of the lacrosse<br />\nworld. But when Budnitz joined<br />\nthe varsity the following year,<br />\nboth Morrill and most of the<br />\nstars were gone, beginning what<br />\nBudnitz called \"the lean years,\"<br />\nsix years of (for Hopkins),<br />\ncomparative mediocrity.<br />\nBut success would come for<br />\nBudnitz; 1951 was just the<br />\nbeginning of what was, and still<br />\nis, a long affiliation with the<br />\ngame. After spending two years<br />\nin military service, he went on to<br />\nplay 10 years with the Mount<br />\nWashington<br />\nLacrosse<br />\nClub,<br />\n\"where if we lost a game every<br />\ntwo years, people thought the<br />\nworld was coming to an end,\" at<br />\nthe same time helping to coach<br />\nat Loyola and Gilman High<br />\nSchools. He retired from the<br />\nfield in 1965, but remained on<br />\nthe sidelines as an assistant<br />\ncoach at JHU for nine years.<br />\nNor did his departure from<br />\nHopkins end his ties to the<br />\ngame--he is now both the commissioner of club lacrosse and<br />\nthe chairman of the World<br />\nLacrosse Games that will be<br />\nplayed at Hopkins next year.<br />\nHis honors have been numerous--twice All-America at attack,<br />\ntop lacrosse player of the<br />\nprevious 25 years as selected by<br />\nBaltimore magazine, and the<br />\nultimate honor, being inducted<br />\ninto the Lacrosse Hall of Fame.<br /><br />\n\"Lacrosse was very kind to<br />\nme,\" said Budnitz, \"and I think<br />\nin anything I participate in<br />\nin life, if something's been very<br />\nkind to me I ought to give back<br />\nto it, and that's why I coached<br />\nand why I'm still involved with<br />\nthe game at a different level. As<br />\nboth a player and a coach<br />\nat Hopkins I've been proud and<br />\npleased at being a part of the<br />\nHopkins tradition.\"<br />\nBetween his lacrosse commitments, Budnitz has spent 28<br />\nyears in the life insurance<br />\nbusiness and has written three<br />\nbooks on the subject.<br />\n**************<br />\nBob Scott's book Lacrosse<br />\ndescribes how a not-too-athletic<br />\n12-year-old, the waterboy of the<br />\n1950 championship team and<br />\nthe son of one of the great<br />\nnames in Blue Jay lacrosse, had<br />\nendlessly practiced hitting a ball<br />\nagainst a wall until his stickwork<br />\nwas superior to half of the<br />\nmembers of the nation's top<br />\ncollege team. It goes on to<br />\ndescribe how he went on to<br />\nbecome the game's sterling attackman from 1957 to 1959 as a<br />\nmember of a Blue Jay team that<br />\nhad regained its dominance of<br />\nthe lacrosse world under a new<br />\nhead coach, Bob Scott.<br />\nTime passes. Today there's<br />\na little gray around Bill Morrill,<br />\nJr.'s temples. He is the financial<br />\nvice-president of a construction<br />\ncompany. His two sons play<br />\nhigh school lacrosse at St. Paul's.<br />\nAnd Morrill believes nhat the<br />\ngame has changed so much that<br />\n\"our teams would get killed by<br />\ntoday's kids.\"<br /><br />\nlife. I can certainly look back<br />\non my college experience and<br />\nsay that they were the greatest<br />\nfour years of my life both in<br />\nmeeting individuals and experiences, and I would love to have<br />\nthe chance to do it all over<br />\nagain.\"<br />\nAfter the Morrill era ended,<br />\nHopkins was again relegated to<br />\nthe back seat as the Midshipmen<br />\nof Navy dominated the 60's,<br />\nwining or tying for a record<br />\neight consecutive national championships. Not even a star JHU<br />\nmidfielder<br />\nnamed<br />\nHenry<br />\nCiccarone could stem the tide.<br />\n\"What I remember most,\"<br />\nsaid Cowan, \"was when Navy<br />\ncame into Hopkins my sophomore year (1967). Navy had a<br />\n42-game winning streak at the<br />\ntime, and we beat Navy that<br />\nday, 9-6, in front of as many<br />\npeople as possibly could get into<br />\nHomewood Field. People were<br />\nstanding n top of the blackboards of the basketball courts<br />\nto try to get to see the game.\"<br />\nCowan enjoyed great success as an attackman at Hopkins,<br />\ntwice making All-America as the<br />\nJays finally dethroned Navy, but<br />\nhe holds equally high regard for<br />\nhis football career, during which<br />\nhe rewrote the Blue Jay rushing<br />\nrecords and was good enough to<br />\nbe drafted by the Colts.<br />\nThe Colts cut him, so<br />\nCowan went to work for his<br />\nfamily trucking business and<br />\nstarted a warehousing company<br />\nof which he is now president.<br />\nHe attributes his business success<br />\nin part to a lesson he learned as a<br />\nplayer at Hopkins: \"The team<br />\nthat wins is not necessarily the<br /><br />\nLes Matthews blocks a shot in an early 1973 contest against UB.<br />\n\"We were of the wooden- team with the greatest talent.<br />\nstick era,\" said Morrill. (Plastic Many times it's the team with<br />\nsticks were introduced in 1971.) the greatest desire and the<br />\n\"A guy like myself, who was not greatest preparation going into a<br />\nparticularly big or fast (Morrill contest.\"<br />\nCowan believes the game to<br />\nwas 5'11\", 145 in college)<br />\ncould, because he had worked be faster and the equipment<br />\nwith that stick for 15 or 20 better than during his playing<br />\nyears and developed terrific days. On the freshman-eligible<br />\nstickwork, compete with guys rule that was adopted by the<br />\nwho were better athletes. Today NCAA in 1971, he said,\"I think<br />\nthe stick is so easy to learn with, it's much better exposure for a<br />\nthe stickwork is so great at all freshman than playing on a<br />\nlevels, that now it's more em- freshman team as was done<br />\nphasis on being a great athlete before. It gives our freshmen<br />\nand less on being a great lacrosse another year of opportunity to<br />\nplayer or stickhandler. The kids play national lacrosse.\"<br />\ntoday are much better athletes:<br />\nthey're bigger, they're faster, **************<br />\nFor many, lacrosse has had<br />\ntheir stickwork is better.\"<br />\n************** its highs and lows, but few<br />\n\"One of the things that I players' fortunes have fluctuated<br />\ntell the kids a lot,\" said Joe as much as those of goalie Les<br />\nCowan '69, now an assistant Matthews, Class of'73.<br />\nAfter a co-championship in<br />\ncoach at Hopkins,\"is that this is<br />\nthe greatest four years of your 1970, the New York Yankees<br /><br />\nfinishing last could hardly have<br />\nsounded more out of character<br />\nthan when the Blue Jays managed only three victories in all of<br />\n1971. \"Just about anybody<br />\nwho could pass or catch was<br />\nasked to do something,\" said<br />\nMatthews, \"so I was put in in<br />\nriding situations and did some<br />\nutility work in addition to being<br />\nthe backup goalie.\" But only<br />\none year later, a bumper crop of<br />\nnew recruits, featuring Rick<br />\nKowalchuk and Jack Thomas,<br />\nmade the Blue Jays the NCAA<br />\nrunner-up for the next two<br />\nyears.<br />\nOne facet of the \"Dark<br />\nAges\" accompanied the team.<br />\n\"We had worked on a 'stall' type<br />\noffense (patterned after Dean<br />\nSmith's 'four corners').<br />\nWe<br />\nwould sneak off to the far<br />\ncorner of the field, and he (Bob<br />\nScott) used to call it the 'Deepfreeze Johnson.' During the<br />\nnext year, when we would be<br />\nbeating an opponent pretty<br />\nbadly, we would always be<br />\nyelling to go into a stall to<br />\nremind everybody of the way we<br />\nused to have to do it.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays finally won<br />\nthe NCAA playoffs in 1974, but<br />\nMatthews was no longer there.<br />\nInstead, he was playing in, of all<br />\nplaces, Texas, where he was<br />\nattending medical school. \"Here<br />\nI had been playing in the national championship game, and then<br />\nthree weeks down the road I was<br />\nin Houston playing lacrosse,<br />\nwhere you were lucky if you got<br />\nten guys out and nobody could<br />\npass or catch, by and large. It<br />\nwas kind of a shock at first, but<br />\nlacrosse is a small enough game<br />\nin terms of the number of<br />\nlocations and people who are<br />\ninvolved with it that it's sort of a<br />\nfraternal group. These were all<br />\npeople I enjoyed being with.<br /><br />\nship, Matthews said he was in<br />\n\"miserable\" physical shape, but<br />\nhe has now taken up longdistance running and competed<br />\nin the Maryland Marathon.<br />\n\"Once you get that jock mentality, it's hard to totally give it<br />\nup.\"<br />\nHe has been a fixture at thk<br />\nannual alumni-varsity game in<br />\nthe fall, a purely informal affair.<br />\n\"The alumni players' ability<br />\nalways get worse. Some of the<br />\nyounger alumni who are playing<br />\nclub lacrosse stay in good<br />\nlacrosse shape. There are some<br />\nguys who are in no kind of<br />\nshape. Then there are guys who<br />\nare staying in physical shape but<br />\njust pick up a lacrosse stick once<br />\na year, and obviously you can't<br />\nplay good lacrosse doing that.<br />\nAnd then every once in a while<br />\nsome guy will come along and go<br />\nout in that alumni game and<br />\nlook great, five or ten years after<br />\nhe's out of college; it's amazing.<br />\nWe'll say,'Where the hell was he<br />\nten years ago when we needed<br />\nhim?\"<br />\n**************<br />\nIf it hadn't been for an<br />\nunusual gesture from Henry<br />\nCiccarone, Dale Kohler might<br />\nhave gone down in Hopkins<br />\nannals as just another player<br />\nwho didn't quite make it.<br />\n\"In my sophomore year<br />\n(1974), expectations were quite<br />\nhigh that I would be on the<br />\nstarting midfield,\" he said. \"For<br />\none reason or another, my<br />\nperformance was less that what<br />\nwas expected, and I think I<br />\nended up the 13th midfielder<br />\nout of 13. I doubted my own<br />\nability at that point and even<br />\nconsidered transferring to Maryland. We played the Maryland<br />\nLacrosse Club in a scrimmage,<br />\nand I just got chewed up; I<br />\npacked up all my stuff and took.<br />\nit home. I got talked back into<br />\njust hanging around for the first<br />\ngame; we went down to play<br />\nVirginia and lost. Ciccarone<br />\npulled me aside after we got<br />\nback from Charlottesville and<br />\ntold me that he was going to give<br />\nme one more chance. He was<br />\ngoing to give me an opportunity<br />\nto play in the first midfield. He<br />\nfelt that I belonged on the field<br />\nas much as possible, and he was<br />\ngiving me this opportunity<br />\nagainst the wishes of the other<br />\ncoaches.\"<br />\nKohler not only started in<br />\nthat game but did so for the<br />\nremainder of the season and<br />\nbecame a first-team All-America<br />\nin the next two years under<br />\nCiccarone, who replaced Scott as<br />\nhead coach in 1975. But until<br />\nthe present dynasty began in<br />\n1978, it was a series of \"almosts\" for the Jays as Cornell<br />\nstepped to the top.<br />\nFor Kohler, finding himself<br />\nno longer a member of the Jays<br />\nafter graduating in '76 took<br />\nmore of an adjustment than for<br />\nmost.<br /><br />\n\"Over the next three years<br />\nwe developed a fairly decent<br />\nclub in Houston. By the time I<br />\nfinished school down there,<br />\nthere was respectable lacrosse<br />\nthroughout the state, nothing of<br />\nthe caliber out here, but still not<br />\nbad. Right before I left, the<br />\nculmination was that we took an<br />\n'all-star' team to New Orleans<br />\nand played an all-star team from<br />\nFlorida which was made up of<br />\nseveral Navy players who had all<br />\ngone down to Pensacola where<br />\nthey do their flight training.<br />\n(The Texans won.) So I had sort<br />\nof seen it go from nowhere to<br />\npretty good lacrosse.<br />\n\"I played midfield because<br />\nif a guy could pass and run and<br />\ncatch a little bit, they felt<br />\nlike you were wasted standing in<br />\nthe goal.\"<br />\nSo here was a man who had<br />\njust finished a stint as the<br />\nAll-America goalie for a national<br />\nchampionship contender playing<br />\nenthusiastically as a midfielder<br />\nfor a team that the Jays could<br />\nhave beaten with one arm tied<br />\nbehind their backs.<br />\nAfter finishing school in<br />\nKohler played one year for<br />\nHouston, Matthews returned to the Mt.
