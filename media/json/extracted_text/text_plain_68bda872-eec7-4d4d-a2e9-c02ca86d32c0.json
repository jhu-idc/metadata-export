The bill<br />\ndeclares any profit making<br />\ninstitution subject to a Howard<br />\nCounty real estate tax. APL falls<br />\nin that category. Burgess<br />\ncontends.<br />\nAPL maintains that it has<br />\noperated since its inception<br />\nshortly before W.W. II as a solely<br />\neducational facility. As such, it<br />\nhas been declared exempt from a<br />\nportion of the Howard County<br />\nreal estate taxes.

Itf<br />\nemploys many people who are<br />\nreceiving government contracts<br />\nand thereby competing in the job<br />\nmarket,\" Burgess said.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins 'administration does<br />\nnot accept Burgess' account. Dr.<br />\nAlexander Kossiakoff, Director<br />\nof APL,stated,\" Even if the bill<br />\nis passed, it is very probable that<br />\nit won't apply to the lab.

The<br />\nseven include people from the<br />\nRemington Improvement<br />\nAssociation, the Greater<br />\nHomewood Association, and<br />\nother interested citizens,<br />\nincluding second district City<br />\nCouncilman Robert Fitzpatrick '<br />\nand Dr. Chester Wickwire of<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nSteve Harris was appointed to<br />\n<br />\nserve as Executive, a move hailed<br />\nby those involved. Said Wickwire,<br />\n\"Having a board that's<br />\ncommunity-based and having a<br />\nperson like Steve Harris as<br />\nExecutive means we'll be able to<br />\nmove in the direction we want to<br />\ngo.\"<br />\nAs a result of the<br />\nreorganization, HEW has already<br />\nbegun to release funds it had<br />\nbeen withholding to pay off past<br />\ndebts, according to Fitzpatrick.<br />\nIt has been decided also that the<br />\nCenter would return to the<br />\nRemington area at a site to be<br />\nselected.

It is not clear that the bill will pass<br />\nand if it does, it might be declared unconstitutional.<br />\nIndeed, the provisions are so vague that it is possible<br />\nthat APL would not even qualify for taxation. If it<br />\ndoes, this $50,000,000 a year institution would have<br />\nto pay approximately $250,000 in taxes on its<br />\nbuildings. APL currently pays the rest of the<br />\nUniversity about $60,000 for the general<br />\nadministration fund. In addition, the school reaps over<br />\ntwice that in dividends from the APL endowment.<br />\nThough this ammount is small in comparison with the<br />\ntotal budget, it does make a difference in times of<br />\nfinancial austerity such as these. The University must<br />\nnot allow these funds to be eaten up by this proposed<br />\ntax. Indeed, if the quarter of a million dollars is levied,<br />\nAPL itself must be made to absorb the cost. No other<br />\ndivisions of the University should be penalized because<br />\nAPL is judged to be a competitive institution.<br />\nIt is bad enough that the University fixes its name<br />\nto this military laboratory which does so much<br />\nclassified research.

In an effort to maintain the<br />\nhigh quality of teaching and research at<br />\nHopkins, the University has embarked on<br />\na Centennial Capital Development<br />\n\u2022 Campaign designed to raise over one<br />\nhundred million dollars. In a short time<br />\nmembers of the various divisions of the<br />\nUniversity, the President, and the Board<br />\nof Trustees will establish priorities for the<br />\nuse of these funds. 1 believe that the<br />\nestablishment of a Johns Hopkins Law<br />\nSchool should be a major priority.<br />\nThe reputation of Johns Hopkins as a<br />\ncenter for the study of the humanities<br />\nand the social sciences has always been<br />\novershadowed by its distinction as a focal<br />\npoint for medical and scientific teaching<br />\nand research. This imbalance is reflected<br />\nin the number of students applying to the<br />\nUndergraduate School in the humanities<br />\nand social science areas. The<br />\nestablishment of a law school would help<br />\nin altering the image of 1-lopkins as a<br />\ntOtiffielA<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\ncmc..<br />\nCox s_<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nattracting more students in the social<br />\n<br />\nsciences and humanities, might lead to an<br />\nexpan sion of these progra<br />\nremained oof from the problems of<br />\nthe city of Baltimore. The field work<br />\nof law students, and the projects which<br />\nusually emanate from law schools<br />\n(protection of civil liberties, defense of<br />\nthe rights of minorities, preservation of<br />\nthe environment through legal action)<br />\nwould stimulate the involvement of the<br />\nUniversity with the Baltimore<br />\ncommunity.<br />\n<br />\nThe new law school must be<br />\ninnovative. It must follow in the Hopkins<br />\ntradition by becoming a center for<br />\nresearch in the law. It could be a place in<br />\nwhich the law is related to disciplines in<br />\nwhich the University has established its<br />\neminence. The law school could be linked<br />\nto S.A.I.S. through a program for the<br />\nstudy of comparative law, and a program<br />\nin forensic medicine could be created in<br />\nconjunction with the Medical School.<br />\nThe Center for Urban Affairs might be<br />\nlinked to the school in a program for the<br />\nstudy of public policy. These possibilities<br />\nwill lend uniqueness to a new law school.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the establishment of a<br />\nHopkins Law School would bring<br />\nfinancial advantages to the University.<br />\nThe prospective donors to this area of the<br />\nDevelopment Campaign represent<br />\nresources which usually are unavailable to<br />\nJohns Hopkins.

The fact<br />\nthat students want to get out of the dorms but remain<br />\nclose to campus has pushed rents in the Homewood<br />\narea far above their legitimate value.<br />\nIn the larger picture, though, students aren't the<br />\nones who most need an aggressive city agency to take<br />\ntheir complaints to heart.

After graduation, most will move<br />\non to fancy downtown apartments or split-level houses<br />\nin the suburbs.<br />\nA more meaningful and appropriate action for the<br />\ncity would be to use considerable time, energy, money<br />\nand expertise to force the owners of Baltimore's<br />\ncriminally neglected dwellings to improve the<br />\nconditions.<br />\n<br />\nFlash from the past: a return trip home<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nOn the ride back \"home\" to Baltimore<br />\nI began to go over what had taken place<br />\nin the long weekend just past. It was late,<br />\nand the road was a little slick. The people<br />\nin the back seat were nodding off, and<br />\nthe guy riding shotgun next to me was<br />\nlistening to some late night evangelist.<br />\nThe trip home had started simply<br />\nenough with the traditional phone call to<br />\nmy parents to say that we'd get in late<br />\nbecause the roads were so bad. The<br />\nmildly upsetting fact that no one had<br />\nbeen home to answer the call was<br />\nout weighed by the more disquieting<br />\nhappenstance that no one was awake to<br />\ngreet us when we finally did get in.<br />\nThe gang decided it was too early to go<br />\nto sleep for night-minded college<br />\nstudents. Instead we went sledding. We<br />\ndragged out my old Lightning Glider<br />\nfrom the garage; its runners had rusted a<br />\nbit since the days when I had been<br />\n<br />\nchampion sledder on the hill we went to.<br />\nBoys driving the family car home from<br />\ndates looked at us as if we were insane,<br />\nwhile I was looking back at them to see if<br />\nI could possibly know who they were.<br />\nRemember?<br />\nAt the bottom of the sledding hill was<br />\nthe old candy store I went to before<br />\nschool. I told everyone about the owner<br />\nwho always greeted us, \"Hello darling ,\"<br />\nand let us pick out our candy piece by<br />\npiece. I remembered it in complete detail,<br />\nwhile I guessed that they probably<br />\nwouldn't remember what had once been<br />\na focal point in my world.<br />\nBy two o'clock it was finally time for<br />\nbed. The sleeping arrangements were a<br />\nlittle difficult to work out; it would have<br />\nseemed most logical to put some of the<br />\nboys and girls together. But,earlier, I had<br />\nchecked with my father in a joking sort<br />\nof way about the prospects for coed<br />\nhousing, and he had just as jocially<br />\nexplained how victorian he was.<br />\n<br />\nI went into my room after settling<br />\neveryone down. I had done it lots of<br />\ntimes before, but it was different this<br />\ntime. My friends from college were here<br />\nwith me, and what would they think of<br />\nthe pictures on the wall that someone<br />\nhad given me.<br />\nWords<br />\nIn the morning before my friends had<br />\ngotten up, I went to give my mother her<br />\nhello kiss and my father his greeting<br />\nhandshake. They were just burbling over<br />\nwith stories: did I remember so and so<br />\nwha was a friend of my sister's \u2014 well,<br />\nher brother who was just two years<br />\nyounger than me had gotten into<br />\nNorthwestern early admissions.<br />\nAfter my parents and I had had time<br />\nto talk a little, we all went down to<br />\nbreakfast. My parents were getting to see,<br />\nand be seen by, my friends for the first<br />\ntime. They all smiled and tried to act<br />\nalert and quick, even though they were<br />\nused to tasteless breakfasts and mumbled<br />\n<br />\nmornings. As we sat down to the food, I<br />\nwasn't sure how to act. My friends didn't<br />\nknow when they should dig in, if they<br />\nshould laugh at my father's jokes that<br />\ndidn't come to a punch line, or if they<br />\nshould get serious when my mother told<br />\nmy sister not to eat too much. I was used<br />\nto all of those family things, but just like<br />\nmy friends I wasn't sure how I should<br />\nreact. The phone rang during the meal,<br />\nand it flashed through my mind that it<br />\nwouldn't be for me. Even so, I answered,<br />\nand got to explain to one of my mother's<br />\nfriends why I was at home in the middle<br />\nof the semester. I called my mother,and<br />\nwhen she thanked me, using my family<br />\nnickname, my friends tittered.<br />\nFinally it was time to go, and the<br />\ngoodbyes were brief. Everyone thanked<br />\neveryone gratefully. The gang got back in<br />\nthe car, and we started back to school.<br />\nEverybody lit a cigarette, and I got to<br />\nsmoke the one that I still couldn't light at<br />\nhome.<br />\n<br />\nLet the buyer beware<br />\n_Ektiky 4rw<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\nYou've finally decided that you really<br />\nneed a car after all, and you're going to a<br />\nfew dealers to see what they have.

It was typical of many<br />\nof the shows with its mix of music,<br />\noddball cults, politics, tension and<br />\nirritating comments by the most hated<br />\nwoman since Alice Crimmins,<br />\navante-garde artist Yoko Ono. It was also<br />\njoyous and historic: John Lennon met<br />\nChuck Berry for the first time.<br />\nThe show opened with Yoko singing in<br />\nher breathy approximation of a normal<br />\n\u2022 voice, as John dutifully played acoustic<br />\nguitar behind her. \"Oh sisters, oh sisters,<br />\nwe must be free, oh sisters, oh sisters, we<br />\nmust be free...\" She sang with an intense<br />\nsincerity that unfortunately made her<br />\n<br />\nPresidential Hang-Up<br />\n<br />\nbit harried after all his years of touring<br />\nand singing, and plugging in his large<br />\nguitar, he nodded at John and the show<br />\nbegan.<br />\n\"Maybelline, why can't you be true?\"<br />\nThey stood facing each other, Lennon<br />\nsinging with Berry like he had with Paul,<br />\nsmiling broadly after each verse was sung.<br />\nThe studio audience cheered and clapped,<br />\nand when the camera panned to them,<br />\nyou could see the kids sitting in the<br />\naisles. John and Chuck were good friends<br />\nby now, and during the brief break for<br />\nbanal conversation with Douglas, John<br />\nkept reaching over for a soul handshake.<br />\nThen it was back to the stage, to<br />\nperformance, to rock and roll, and the<br />\npower was incredible.<br />\nPlugged In<br />\nPlugged in now, both ready, Berry<br />\nturned to John and said, \"O.K., Johnny,<br />\nit's Johnny B.

Lennon harmonized at<br />\nthe chorus, and at one point, Berry<br />\npointed to Lennon with his guitar neck<br />\nand John took a lead guitar break.-John<br />\nwas clumsy and excited and the riff was<br />\nfried, but at least he hadn't collapsed<br />\nfrom the pressure he has come fear over<br />\nthe years.

Not to say that American<br />\ncars haven't Changed, in fact there has<br />\nbeen tremendous change, but three<br />\nfourths of it has been in how the cars<br />\nlook. The stylists in Detroit greatly<br />\noutnumber the engineers, and more<br />\nmoney is spent every year in retooling<br />\nthe assembly plants to turn out the<br />\nswoopy new models than most of us will<br />\nmake in a lifetime.<br />\n<br />\nThere are other avenues, of course, and<br />\nabout 15% of all cars sold in the U.S. last<br />\nyear were made in foreign countries. In<br />\nSouthern California, which is often<br />\nregarded as a predictor for future trends,<br />\nimported cars took well over 40% of the<br />\nmarket last year, and for good reasons.<br />\nWhat American car, for example, offers a<br />\nroomy seating package for four with<br />\nadequate trunk space in a sedan of<br />\nmodest proportions? In Europe, you can<br />\nchoose an-1611g a bewildering array of cars:<br />\nfront-wheel drive cars, rear engined cars<br />\nand within these categories there is a vast<br />\nrange of sizes and prices.<br />\nThere are several basic criteria you<br />\nshould consider if you are about to buy a<br />\nnew car. The size is the main thing to be<br />\n<br />\ndetermined, and you must weigh the<br />\nfrequency with which you will carry six<br />\nfull-size adults in luxurious comfort<br />\nagainst the time you will spend driving<br />\nalone. If you stand on Charles Street and<br />\nwatch the rush hour traffic someday, you<br />\nwill notice that the great majority of cars<br />\nwhich pass by are huge twenty-foot long<br />\nbehemoths carrying one person. Is it<br />\nreally necessary? Couldn't you make do<br />\nwith a four, or even two-passenger car?<br />\n(at least that way no one will ask you to<br />\ndrive your five maiden aunts to the<br />\nchurch bazaar at nine o'clock Sunday<br />\nmorning).<br />\nFuel Comsumption<br />\nAnother factor which is becoming<br />\nincreasingly important is fuel<br />\nconsumption. It seems really inexcusable<br />\nto buy a car which will take you 10 miles<br />\nfor every gallon of gasoline, when there<br />\nare many cars which are just as<br />\ncomfortable, and will deliver two and<br />\nthree times that mileage figure. Apart<br />\nfrom using up the world's not so<br />\ninexhaustible oil reserves, the car which<br />\ngets poor mileage will belch a far greater<br />\namount of noxious gases into the<br />\nbiosphere.<br />\nOne of the other important<br />\nconsiderations is that of handling, which<br />\nis very much a safety-related factor.<br />\nMany of the safety measures which are<br />\nbeing introduced on new cars could be<br />\ncalled 'after-the-fact' measures. That is,<br />\nthey make no effort to require cars which<br />\nare able to avoid an accident, either by<br />\nsteering around it or stopping short of it.<br />\nRather, the Department of<br />\nTransportation seems to be assuming that<br />\ncrashes are pretty much unavoidable, and<br />\nthat the way to prevent injurie& is to pad<br />\nthe dashboards of cars, to remove sharp<br />\nobjects from the path of flying<br />\npassengers, and to require collapsible<br />\nsteering columns. These measures are<br />\ngood ones, undeniably, but it would be<br />\nmore productive (except for body shops,<br />\nperhaps) to require certain standards of<br />\ncornering power which might enable a<br />\ndriver to steer around a hazard rather<br />\nthan jam on the brakes and blindly plow<br />\ninto it because the brakes aren't good<br />\nenough, and/or because his car becomes<br />\nuncontrollable under heavy braking.<br />\nCompromise<br />\nHandling is much harder to define than<br />\nbraking, but in general a good-handling<br />\ncar will have a sensitive steering<br />\nmechanism, good tires (preferably radials,<br />\nbecause they keep more of the actual<br />\ntread in contact with the road while<br />\nturning than other types), and a high<br />\nlateral acceleration capability, which is<br />\n<br />\nmeasured in g-s, ana snoula be at least .0<br />\ng. The turning circle should be no more<br />\nthan 36 feet in radius, and it should not<br />\nrequire more than 4 turns of the steering<br />\nwheel to go from lock to opposit lock.<br />\nGood braking, which is highly dependent<br />\non good tires and driver skill (brakes<br />\nwhich are locked up slide the tires on the<br />\nroad and take a longer distance to stop),<br />\ncan be defined in terms of deceleration<br />\nrate in g's, and in distance required to<br />\nstop from a given speed. A panic stop<br />\nfrom 80 mph should not require more<br />\nthan 350 feet to accomplish, and the<br />\nbrakes should not fade much under<br />\nrepeated hard braking.<br />\nThe other primary factor is engine size<br />\nand weight of the car, since the two<br />\ntogether determine the acceleration<br />\ncapabilities, and in conjunction with<br />\nrear-end ratios, the cruising ability.<br />\nAlthough most American cars sold are<br />\nequipped with eight-cylinder engines,<br />\nthere is no reason that a well-designed six<br />\nor four cylinder engine should not be<br />\nused. The amount of horsepower<br />\nproduced by a given internal combustion<br />\nengine will vary greatly with its design.<br />\nThere are four-cylinder engines which<br />\nproduce forty horsepower, and there are<br />\nfour-cylinder engines which produce 200<br />\nhorsepower. The figures are meaningless<br />\nunless they are divided into the curb<br />\nweight of the car, which is defined as the<br />\nweight including all liquids such as oil,<br />\nwater, and gas. This division will yield a<br />\nfigure which gives the actual performance<br />\npotential of the car. Twenty-five pounds<br />\nper horsepower is a good ratio, allowing<br />\nfor good acceleration onto highways,<br />\npassing with some reserve power on hand.<br />\nThe acceleration is also dependent on the<br />\nratio of the transmission gears and the<br />\nrear end or transude, which delivers the<br />\npower to the wheels. The higher this<br />\nratio, the higher and acceleration rate will<br />\nbe, but the lower the top speed. If you<br />\nare more interested in cruising at high<br />\nspeed than in blinding acceleration, a<br />\ngood rear-end ratio might be 3.1.

One of the<br />\nworkers, who has been here<br />\nlonger than many professors and<br />\nall the students asked, \"You<br />\nmean Eisenhower's house, don't<br />\nGet Hip To<br />\nHARLEY SANDWICHES<br />\nOpen Late<br />\nBARLEY'S 3111 St.Paul<br />\n<br />\nyou?\" Mr. Wisnom pointed out<br />\nthat the rye grass now growing<br />\n\"has to be re-planted every<br />\nyear.\"<br />\n\"There are steam pipes for<br />\nheating the house and the faculty<br />\nclub underneath the lawn and the<br />\nheat burns the stuff up,\"<br />\nexplained Wisnom. Eight inches<br />\nor so of topsoil cover the pipes,<br />\nbut the men all know that's not<br />\nenough to prevent the heat from<br />\nkilling off the grass. All you have<br />\nto do is go by on a snowy day<br />\nand see which section of the lawn<br />\nmelts the fastest. That's where<br />\nthe pipes are.<br />\n<br />\nWhat To Do?<br />\nWhat to do? Well, Mr. Wisnom<br />\nand Dave think that planting<br />\nKentucky blue or Kentucky<br />\n<br />\nfescue seed will cure the problem<br />\nand maybe save some money too.<br />\nThe Kentucky seed would<br />\nprobably survive the heat and<br />\nnegate the need for yearly<br />\nre-seeding. If those grasses don't<br />\nsurvive the next winter, they<br />\nmight put down lespedeza, a<br />\nreally hardy grass from Korea.<br />\nBut Mr. Wisnom is a little<br />\nworried that lespedeza grass<br />\nwon't look as good as rye or<br />\nblue.<br />\nSeeding, fertilizing, irrigating<br />\nin the summer time, doing some<br />\nlandscaping and all the planting<br />\n\"You mean Eisenhower's house, don't you?\"<br />\naround new buildings, and just<br />\ntrying to keep all the plants at<br />\nDave, who didn't really want<br />\nlooked when they thought about<br />\nHopkins healthy takes up most<br />\nto be in a newspaper article, said<br />\napplying or attending. \"It's<br />\nof their time. \"But students<br />\nthat he thought people paid a lot<br />\nimportant for the school to look<br />\nmaking paths\u2014that keeps us real<br />\nof attention to the way a school<br />\ngood.\"<br />\nbusy,\" says Mr. Wisnom.<br />\n<br />\nTHE GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS<br />\nARE NOW IN MARYLAND.<br />\n<br />\nNow<br />\navailable!<br />\n<br />\nApple.<br />\nIf we'd been<br />\naround a little<br />\nsooner, Adam<br />\nwouldn't have<br />\neaten an apple.

He hit for the first Blue<br />\nJay points on two foul shots, and then added a<br />\nbasket, a foul shot and another basket before<br />\nbreaking the four figure plateau. With 7:47<br />\nremaining in the half, he was fouled and went to<br />\nthe line to shoot two foul shots. After missing<br />\nthe first free throw, he connected on the second<br />\n<br />\nand the game was momentarily halted by a one<br />\nminute ovation. He was then presented the game<br />\nball.<br />\nAs the second half began, the poise, polish and<br />\nclass of the Loyola team became evident. They<br />\nscored the first eleven points of the period and<br />\neighteen of the first twenty-two. The six point<br />\nBlue Jay halftime lead was transformed into an<br />\neight point Loyola bulge and the lead continued<br />\nto widen. After the Blue Jays closed the gap to<br />\nfour midway through the half, Loyola broke the<br />\ngame open and led by as many as eighteen.<br />\nThe second half was a combination of sloppy<br />\nHopkins play and a tremendous Loyola defensive<br />\neffort. The Greyhound overplaying defense and<br />\nsuperb boxing out on rebounds shut the Blue Jay<br />\noffense off. Bill Jews, who turned in a fine first<br />\nhalf, was held to a single point and few rebounds<br />\nafter intermission. The lone bright spot of the<br />\nsecond half was Gary Handleman's thirteen<br />\npoints raising his career total to 1017 with one<br />\ngame remaining.<br />\n<br />\n1, tomnii<br />\n<br />\nHandlenzan goes in for layup.<br />\n<br />\nIndoor track prepares for AAU South Atlantics<br />\nBy GERRY GREENFIELD<br />\nDeliberately ignoring snow,<br />\nblizzard and gale warnings,<br />\nmembers of the Blue Jay indoor<br />\ntrack team have been continuing<br />\nto work out. In recent weeks,<br />\nhowever, the efforts of Hopkins'<br />\nrunners have fallen just short of<br />\nwinning.<br />\nIn a meet at Essex Community<br />\nCollege on February 5th, Boe<br />\nWalker finished fourth in the<br />\nsixty yard high hurdles. Having<br />\nplaced first in his trial and<br />\nsemi-final heats, with times of<br />\n8.1 and 8.2 seconds respectively,<br />\nBoe drew lane four for the finals.<br />\nHalfway through the race, Boe<br />\nkicked a hurdle and dropped<br />\nfrom second place down tc<br />\nfourth. Walker finally crossed thc<br />\nfinish line with a time of 8.2<br />\nseconds, far from his best time.<br />\nMeanwhile, in the 50-yard<br />\ndash, Mark Cummings won his<br />\ntrial heat with a time of 5.8<br />\nseconds. In the semi-finals,<br />\nhowever, Mark finished a close<br />\nsecond, which prevented him<br />\nfrom getting good lane position<br />\nin the finals of that race.<br />\nOn February 18th, at Towson<br />\nState, Hopkins managed to place<br />\nonly one person in the<br />\nAll-Corners meet.<br />\nOn a long version of a<br />\nbasketball court, high hurdlers,<br />\nBoe Walker and Gerry<br />\nGreenfield, both failed to make<br />\nthe finals. Similarly, in the high<br />\njump event, defendingchampion<br />\nGerry Greenfield was only able<br />\nto place a distant third, as he<br />\nfailed to clear a height of six feet<br />\non a series of near misses.<br />\nNevertheless, when asked<br />\n<br />\nabout the team's progress so far,<br />\nCoach Don Masken was very<br />\noptimistic. According to him, the<br />\nexperience gained by members of<br />\nthe indoor team will enable them<br />\nto assist members of the spring<br />\ntrack team. This experience<br />\ncoupled with several returning<br />\n<br />\nveterans and talented freshmen<br />\nshould make this year's spring<br />\nteam that much better, in<br />\nMasken's view.<br />\nThe indoor track team,<br />\nthough, still has three more<br />\nmeets, the two most important<br />\nones occurring early in March.<br />\n<br />\nThe first of these is the AAU<br />\nSouth Atlantic Association<br />\nIndoor Championships, which<br />\nwill be held March 3rd, at the<br />\nFifth Regiment Armory. The<br />\nsecond, and the more important<br />\nof the two meets from a team<br />\npoint of view, is the MAC Indoor<br />\n<br />\nChampionships, scheduled to be<br />\nheld March I 1 th at Swarthmore<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nLast year in this meet,<br />\nHopkins entered three freshmen.<br />\nWith a larger and more<br />\nexperienced squad, the Jays hope<br />\nto do better this year.<br />\n<br />\nsports briefs<br />\nFencing<br />\nLast Tuesday night, the varsity<br />\nfencing team made a strong<br />\nshowing against the Salle Palasz<br />\nfencing club of Baltimore,<br />\nwinning the contest by a score of<br />\n20-7.<br />\nGlenn Pantel and John<br />\nBurdakin each won three bouts<br />\nas they led the foil team to an<br />\n8-1 victory.

All of the jv foilmen were<br />\nincluded in this pool, except for<br />\nBelsky, even though Belsky has<br />\nbeaten all of these men in<br />\npractice and has expressed the<br />\nopinion that he may have more<br />\npotential than them.<br />\nAccording to Coach Oles,<br />\nthough, Belsky does not have as<br />\nmuch ability as the others, as can<br />\nbe shown by his 1-4 record in<br />\noutside bouts. In response to a<br />\nquestion about Belsky's<br />\nperformance in regular workouts,<br />\nOles replied, \"Practices don't<br />\nreally show you anything. When<br />\nyou work out with the same<br />\npeople day after day, you get to<br />\nknow each other's moves and, as<br />\na result, you can't really judge<br />\nfrom this type of results. You<br />\nreally have to look at his outside<br />\nperformance, and his 1-4 record<br />\njust isn't good enough to be on<br />\nthe varsity pool. I cut five or six<br />\nother boys from the varsity pool<br />\ntoo, who have fenced longer than<br />\nBelsky ever did, so I don't think<br />\nI'm really discriminating.\"<br />\nWhether or not Oles is<br />\ndiscriminating against Belsky,<br />\nthere has been another recent<br />\ndevelopment, which seems to<br />\nfurther hinder Belsky's chances<br />\nof making the varsity team next<br />\n<br />\nyear. This was the team's<br />\ndecision to again adopt the<br />\npolicy that \"any experienced<br />\nupperclassman who does not<br />\nmake the varsity will no longer<br />\nbe able to fence.\"<br />\nCoach Oles claims that this<br />\npolicy is nothing really new,<br />\nsince the jv team (except for this<br />\npast season) was always made up<br />\nof \"people who had never fenced<br />\nbefore and those experienced<br />\nfreshmen who were being given a<br />\ntrial run.\"<br />\nOles had never felt this policy<br />\nto be discriminatory since, from<br />\na common sense point of view,<br />\nhe can only accomodate as many<br />\npeople on the varsity as he has<br />\nuniforms. \"I try to keep as many<br />\nexperienced people as I can,<br />\nespecially those I feel have a<br />\ncertain minimum amount of<br />\nfencing ability. The others, for<br />\nwhom I cannot supply uniforms<br />\nanyway, I consider deadwood.<br />\nFurthermore, I don't like to put<br />\nthese men back on jv, since they<br />\nadversely affect the performance<br />\nof those who have never fenced<br />\nbefore and who need special<br />\nteaching.\"<br />\nAccording to Oles, Belsky<br />\nwould qualify as an \"experienced<br />\nupperclassman\" next year, since<br />\nhe has fenced in high school, and<br />\nsince he has worked out most of<br />\nthe season with the Graduate<br />\nStudent Fencing Club (thus<br />\ngetting experience while not<br />\nreally being on the varsity).<br />\nIn effect, it looks like Belsky's<br />\nchances \"are nil\" for continuing<br />\nhis fencing next year, simply due<br />\nto what Coach Oles claims is \"his<br />\nlack of ability.\"<br />\n<br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br />\n\"The MAC is in the bag.\"<br />\nComfort, however, is by no<br />\nJohns Hopkins' high-flying<br />\nswimmers last night began their<br />\nmeans willing to sit on his<br />\ndefense of the first of two laurels of snaring a pair of easy<br />\nconference titles at the opening conference titles or compiling a<br />\nsession of the Mason-Dixon<br />\n13-2 dual meet record over such<br />\ntournament at Towson State.<br />\nswimming non-powers as Loyola,<br />\nThe meet, scheduled to Towson,PMC,and the like.<br />\ncontinue through tomorrow<br />\n\"I could say, 'We were great,<br />\nnight, sees the Blue Jays firmly<br />\nwe were 13-2,' but that would be<br />\ninstalled as solid favorites to<br />\nridiculous; we knew we were<br />\nretain the championship they going to be 13-2 before the<br />\nwrestled from Catholic season started.

The bill<br />\ndeclares any profit making<br />\ninstitution subject to a Howard<br />\nCounty real estate tax. APL falls<br />\nin that category. Burgess<br />\ncontends.<br />\nAPL maintains that it has<br />\noperated since its inception<br />\nshortly before W.W. II as a solely<br />\neducational facility. As such, it<br />\nhas been declared exempt from a<br />\nportion of the Howard County<br />\nreal estate taxes. Burgess<br />\ncontends, however, that APL is<br />\nnot solely an educational<br />\ninstitution.<br />\n\"We feel that APL does not<br />\nqualify as an exclusively<br />\neducational institution. Itf<br />\nemploys many people who are<br />\nreceiving government contracts<br />\nand thereby competing in the job<br />\nmarket,\" Burgess said.<br /><br />\nHopkins 'administration does<br />\nnot accept Burgess' account. Dr.<br />\nAlexander Kossiakoff, Director<br />\nof APL,stated,\" Even if the bill<br />\nis passed, it is very probable that<br />\nit won't apply to the lab. We<br />\nrealize that Delegate Burgess<br />\nwould like to get as much money<br />\nfor Howard County as he can,<br />\nbut we don't feel that this bill is<br />\nappropriate.\"<br />\nKossiakoff mentioned that the<br />\nbill, as presented, was extremely<br />\nvague. \" If interpreted widely, it<br />\nwould apply to churches, private<br />\nclubs, almost anybody who has<br />\nany property that draws income,<br />\nWe don't feel that this is right.\"<br />\nBurgess admitted that this sort<br />\nof taxation was exactly what he<br />\nhad in mind. \"I belong to<br />\nKiwanis.

Burgess<br />\nholds, \"While Hopkins is not<br />\ninvolved with competitive<br />\nbidding for their projects, they<br />\ndo receive federal contracts that<br />\ncan also be handled by private<br />\ncorporations. In this way, they<br />\nare not operating exclusively as<br />\nan educational facility, and<br />\nshould be taxed just as you or I<br />\nwould be if we were to do the<br />\nsame work.\"<br />\nEducation<br />\nQuandt, however, stated<br />\nNone of the contracts at APL<br />\nwould go to private industry.

It is not clear that the bill will pass<br />\nand if it does, it might be declared unconstitutional.<br />\nIndeed, the provisions are so vague that it is possible<br />\nthat APL would not even qualify for taxation. If it<br />\ndoes, this $50,000,000 a year institution would have<br />\nto pay approximately $250,000 in taxes on its<br />\nbuildings.

In an effort to maintain the<br />\nhigh quality of teaching and research at<br />\nHopkins, the University has embarked on<br />\na Centennial Capital Development<br />\n\u2022 Campaign designed to raise over one<br />\nhundred million dollars. In a short time<br />\nmembers of the various divisions of the<br />\nUniversity, the President, and the Board<br />\nof Trustees will establish priorities for the<br />\nuse of these funds. 1 believe that the<br />\nestablishment of a Johns Hopkins Law<br />\nSchool should be a major priority.<br />\nThe reputation of Johns Hopkins as a<br />\ncenter for the study of the humanities<br />\nand the social sciences has always been<br />\novershadowed by its distinction as a focal<br />\npoint for medical and scientific teaching<br />\nand research.

The field work<br />\nof law students, and the projects which<br />\nusually emanate from law schools<br />\n(protection of civil liberties, defense of<br />\nthe rights of minorities, preservation of<br />\nthe environment through legal action)<br />\nwould stimulate the involvement of the<br />\nUniversity with the Baltimore<br />\ncommunity.<br /><br />\nThe new law school must be<br />\ninnovative. It must follow in the Hopkins<br />\ntradition by becoming a center for<br />\nresearch in the law. It could be a place in<br />\nwhich the law is related to disciplines in<br />\nwhich the University has established its<br />\neminence. The law school could be linked<br />\nto S.A.I.S. through a program for the<br />\nstudy of comparative law, and a program<br />\nin forensic medicine could be created in<br />\nconjunction with the Medical School.<br />\nThe Center for Urban Affairs might be<br />\nlinked to the school in a program for the<br />\nstudy of public policy. These possibilities<br />\nwill lend uniqueness to a new law school.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the establishment of a<br />\nHopkins Law School would bring<br />\nfinancial advantages to the University.<br />\nThe prospective donors to this area of the<br />\nDevelopment Campaign represent<br />\nresources which usually are unavailable to<br />\nJohns Hopkins.

The key word here is no one.<br />\nStudents living in the areas adjacent to campus have<br />\nlong been exploited-to some degree, great or small-by<br />\nlandlords who have taken advantage of a combination<br />\nof ignorance or apathy on the students part. The fact<br />\nthat students want to get out of the dorms but remain<br />\nclose to campus has pushed rents in the Homewood<br />\narea far above their legitimate value.<br />\nIn the larger picture, though, students aren't the<br />\nones who most need an aggressive city agency to take<br />\ntheir complaints to heart. In actual fact, lots of tenants<br />\nhave far greater, far more important problems, and one<br />\ndoesn't have to look far from Homewood to see them.<br />\nStudents, after, will live in these apartments for a<br />\nfew years at most. After graduation, most will move<br />\non to fancy downtown apartments or split-level houses<br />\nin the suburbs.<br />\nA more meaningful and appropriate action for the<br />\ncity would be to use considerable time, energy, money<br />\nand expertise to force the owners of Baltimore's<br />\ncriminally neglected dwellings to improve the<br />\nconditions.<br /><br />\nFlash from the past: a return trip home<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nOn the ride back \"home\" to Baltimore<br />\nI began to go over what had taken place<br />\nin the long weekend just past. It was late,<br />\nand the road was a little slick. The people<br />\nin the back seat were nodding off, and<br />\nthe guy riding shotgun next to me was<br />\nlistening to some late night evangelist.<br />\nThe trip home had started simply<br />\nenough with the traditional phone call to<br />\nmy parents to say that we'd get in late<br />\nbecause the roads were so bad. The<br />\nmildly upsetting fact that no one had<br />\nbeen home to answer the call was<br />\nout weighed by the more disquieting<br />\nhappenstance that no one was awake to<br />\ngreet us when we finally did get in.<br />\nThe gang decided it was too early to go<br />\nto sleep for night-minded college<br />\nstudents. Instead we went sledding. We<br />\ndragged out my old Lightning Glider<br />\nfrom the garage; its runners had rusted a<br />\nbit since the days when I had been<br /><br />\nchampion sledder on the hill we went to.<br />\nBoys driving the family car home from<br />\ndates looked at us as if we were insane,<br />\nwhile I was looking back at them to see if<br />\nI could possibly know who they were.<br />\nRemember?<br />\nAt the bottom of the sledding hill was<br />\nthe old candy store I went to before<br />\nschool. I told everyone about the owner<br />\nwho always greeted us, \"Hello darling ,\"<br />\nand let us pick out our candy piece by<br />\npiece. I remembered it in complete detail,<br />\nwhile I guessed that they probably<br />\nwouldn't remember what had once been<br />\na focal point in my world.<br />\nBy two o'clock it was finally time for<br />\nbed. The sleeping arrangements were a<br />\nlittle difficult to work out; it would have<br />\nseemed most logical to put some of the<br />\nboys and girls together. But,earlier, I had<br />\nchecked with my father in a joking sort<br />\nof way about the prospects for coed<br />\nhousing, and he had just as jocially<br />\nexplained how victorian he was.<br /><br />\nI went into my room after settling<br />\neveryone down.

My friends from college were here<br />\nwith me, and what would they think of<br />\nthe pictures on the wall that someone<br />\nhad given me.<br />\nWords<br />\nIn the morning before my friends had<br />\ngotten up, I went to give my mother her<br />\nhello kiss and my father his greeting<br />\nhandshake. They were just burbling over<br />\nwith stories: did I remember so and so<br />\nwha was a friend of my sister's \u2014 well,<br />\nher brother who was just two years<br />\nyounger than me had gotten into<br />\nNorthwestern early admissions.<br />\nAfter my parents and I had had time<br />\nto talk a little, we all went down to<br />\nbreakfast. My parents were getting to see,<br />\nand be seen by, my friends for the first<br />\ntime. They all smiled and tried to act<br />\nalert and quick, even though they were<br />\nused to tasteless breakfasts and mumbled<br /><br />\nmornings. As we sat down to the food, I<br />\nwasn't sure how to act. My friends didn't<br />\nknow when they should dig in, if they<br />\nshould laugh at my father's jokes that<br />\ndidn't come to a punch line, or if they<br />\nshould get serious when my mother told<br />\nmy sister not to eat too much. I was used<br />\nto all of those family things, but just like<br />\nmy friends I wasn't sure how I should<br />\nreact. The phone rang during the meal,<br />\nand it flashed through my mind that it<br />\nwouldn't be for me. Even so, I answered,<br />\nand got to explain to one of my mother's<br />\nfriends why I was at home in the middle<br />\nof the semester. I called my mother,and<br />\nwhen she thanked me, using my family<br />\nnickname, my friends tittered.<br />\nFinally it was time to go, and the<br />\ngoodbyes were brief. Everyone thanked<br />\neveryone gratefully. The gang got back in<br />\nthe car, and we started back to school.<br />\nEverybody lit a cigarette, and I got to<br />\nsmoke the one that I still couldn't light at<br />\nhome.<br /><br />\nLet the buyer beware<br />\n_Ektiky 4rw<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\nYou've finally decided that you really<br />\nneed a car after all, and you're going to a<br />\nfew dealers to see what they have.

It was typical of many<br />\nof the shows with its mix of music,<br />\noddball cults, politics, tension and<br />\nirritating comments by the most hated<br />\nwoman since Alice Crimmins,<br />\navante-garde artist Yoko Ono. It was also<br />\njoyous and historic: John Lennon met<br />\nChuck Berry for the first time.<br />\nThe show opened with Yoko singing in<br />\nher breathy approximation of a normal<br />\n\u2022 voice, as John dutifully played acoustic<br />\nguitar behind her. \"Oh sisters, oh sisters,<br />\nwe must be free, oh sisters, oh sisters, we<br />\nmust be free...\" She sang with an intense<br />\nsincerity that unfortunately made her<br /><br />\nPresidential Hang-Up<br /><br />\nbit harried after all his years of touring<br />\nand singing, and plugging in his large<br />\nguitar, he nodded at John and the show<br />\nbegan.<br />\n\"Maybelline, why can't you be true?\"<br />\nThey stood facing each other, Lennon<br />\nsinging with Berry like he had with Paul,<br />\nsmiling broadly after each verse was sung.<br />\nThe studio audience cheered and clapped,<br />\nand when the camera panned to them,<br />\nyou could see the kids sitting in the<br />\naisles. John and Chuck were good friends<br />\nby now, and during the brief break for<br />\nbanal conversation with Douglas, John<br />\nkept reaching over for a soul handshake.<br />\nThen it was back to the stage, to<br />\nperformance, to rock and roll, and the<br />\npower was incredible.<br />\nPlugged In<br />\nPlugged in now, both ready, Berry<br />\nturned to John and said, \"O.K., Johnny,<br />\nit's Johnny B.

Lennon harmonized at<br />\nthe chorus, and at one point, Berry<br />\npointed to Lennon with his guitar neck<br />\nand John took a lead guitar break.-John<br />\nwas clumsy and excited and the riff was<br />\nfried, but at least he hadn't collapsed<br />\nfrom the pressure he has come fear over<br />\nthe years.

Not to say that American<br />\ncars haven't Changed, in fact there has<br />\nbeen tremendous change, but three<br />\nfourths of it has been in how the cars<br />\nlook. The stylists in Detroit greatly<br />\noutnumber the engineers, and more<br />\nmoney is spent every year in retooling<br />\nthe assembly plants to turn out the<br />\nswoopy new models than most of us will<br />\nmake in a lifetime.<br /><br />\nThere are other avenues, of course, and<br />\nabout 15% of all cars sold in the U.S. last<br />\nyear were made in foreign countries. In<br />\nSouthern California, which is often<br />\nregarded as a predictor for future trends,<br />\nimported cars took well over 40% of the<br />\nmarket last year, and for good reasons.<br />\nWhat American car, for example, offers a<br />\nroomy seating package for four with<br />\nadequate trunk space in a sedan of<br />\nmodest proportions? In Europe, you can<br />\nchoose an-1611g a bewildering array of cars:<br />\nfront-wheel drive cars, rear engined cars<br />\nand within these categories there is a vast<br />\nrange of sizes and prices.<br />\nThere are several basic criteria you<br />\nshould consider if you are about to buy a<br />\nnew car. The size is the main thing to be<br /><br />\ndetermined, and you must weigh the<br />\nfrequency with which you will carry six<br />\nfull-size adults in luxurious comfort<br />\nagainst the time you will spend driving<br />\nalone. If you stand on Charles Street and<br />\nwatch the rush hour traffic someday, you<br />\nwill notice that the great majority of cars<br />\nwhich pass by are huge twenty-foot long<br />\nbehemoths carrying one person. Is it<br />\nreally necessary? Couldn't you make do<br />\nwith a four, or even two-passenger car?<br />\n(at least that way no one will ask you to<br />\ndrive your five maiden aunts to the<br />\nchurch bazaar at nine o'clock Sunday<br />\nmorning).<br />\nFuel Comsumption<br />\nAnother factor which is becoming<br />\nincreasingly important is fuel<br />\nconsumption. It seems really inexcusable<br />\nto buy a car which will take you 10 miles<br />\nfor every gallon of gasoline, when there<br />\nare many cars which are just as<br />\ncomfortable, and will deliver two and<br />\nthree times that mileage figure. Apart<br />\nfrom using up the world's not so<br />\ninexhaustible oil reserves, the car which<br />\ngets poor mileage will belch a far greater<br />\namount of noxious gases into the<br />\nbiosphere.<br />\nOne of the other important<br />\nconsiderations is that of handling, which<br />\nis very much a safety-related factor.<br />\nMany of the safety measures which are<br />\nbeing introduced on new cars could be<br />\ncalled 'after-the-fact' measures. That is,<br />\nthey make no effort to require cars which<br />\nare able to avoid an accident, either by<br />\nsteering around it or stopping short of it.<br />\nRather, the Department of<br />\nTransportation seems to be assuming that<br />\ncrashes are pretty much unavoidable, and<br />\nthat the way to prevent injurie&amp; is to pad<br />\nthe dashboards of cars, to remove sharp<br />\nobjects from the path of flying<br />\npassengers, and to require collapsible<br />\nsteering columns. These measures are<br />\ngood ones, undeniably, but it would be<br />\nmore productive (except for body shops,<br />\nperhaps) to require certain standards of<br />\ncornering power which might enable a<br />\ndriver to steer around a hazard rather<br />\nthan jam on the brakes and blindly plow<br />\ninto it because the brakes aren't good<br />\nenough, and/or because his car becomes<br />\nuncontrollable under heavy braking.<br />\nCompromise<br />\nHandling is much harder to define than<br />\nbraking, but in general a good-handling<br />\ncar will have a sensitive steering<br />\nmechanism, good tires (preferably radials,<br />\nbecause they keep more of the actual<br />\ntread in contact with the road while<br />\nturning than other types), and a high<br />\nlateral acceleration capability, which is<br /><br />\nmeasured in g-s, ana snoula be at least .0<br />\ng. The turning circle should be no more<br />\nthan 36 feet in radius, and it should not<br />\nrequire more than 4 turns of the steering<br />\nwheel to go from lock to opposit lock.<br />\nGood braking, which is highly dependent<br />\non good tires and driver skill (brakes<br />\nwhich are locked up slide the tires on the<br />\nroad and take a longer distance to stop),<br />\ncan be defined in terms of deceleration<br />\nrate in g's, and in distance required to<br />\nstop from a given speed. A panic stop<br />\nfrom 80 mph should not require more<br />\nthan 350 feet to accomplish, and the<br />\nbrakes should not fade much under<br />\nrepeated hard braking.<br />\nThe other primary factor is engine size<br />\nand weight of the car, since the two<br />\ntogether determine the acceleration<br />\ncapabilities, and in conjunction with<br />\nrear-end ratios, the cruising ability.<br />\nAlthough most American cars sold are<br />\nequipped with eight-cylinder engines,<br />\nthere is no reason that a well-designed six<br />\nor four cylinder engine should not be<br />\nused. The amount of horsepower<br />\nproduced by a given internal combustion<br />\nengine will vary greatly with its design.<br />\nThere are four-cylinder engines which<br />\nproduce forty horsepower, and there are<br />\nfour-cylinder engines which produce 200<br />\nhorsepower. The figures are meaningless<br />\nunless they are divided into the curb<br />\nweight of the car, which is defined as the<br />\nweight including all liquids such as oil,<br />\nwater, and gas. This division will yield a<br />\nfigure which gives the actual performance<br />\npotential of the car. Twenty-five pounds<br />\nper horsepower is a good ratio, allowing<br />\nfor good acceleration onto highways,<br />\npassing with some reserve power on hand.<br />\nThe acceleration is also dependent on the<br />\nratio of the transmission gears and the<br />\nrear end or transude, which delivers the<br />\npower to the wheels. The higher this<br />\nratio, the higher and acceleration rate will<br />\nbe, but the lower the top speed. If you<br />\nare more interested in cruising at high<br />\nspeed than in blinding acceleration, a<br />\ngood rear-end ratio might be 3.1. That is,<br />\nfor every three revolutions the engine<br />\nmakes, the wheels will make one. On the<br />\nother hand, more acceleration will be<br />\nobtained by using a 4:1 ratio, but these<br />\nare only the outer practical limits, and<br />\nthere are a host of intermediates between<br />\nthese figures.<br />\nNow that you know some figures, you<br />\ncan go out and look around at cars, but<br />\nalso read test reports,seek opinions from<br />\nowners, and above all, drive the car you<br />\nare interested in and have someone with<br />\nmechanical ability look it over for you<br />\nbefore you make the plunge which can<br />\ncause you ,either genuine pleasure or<br />\ngrief.<br /><br />\npage 8/news-letter/feb 25, 1972<br /><br />\nGrounds crew demonstrates aesthetic concern<br />\nBy ROBERT RUBY<br /><br />\nMr. Wisnom, Dave, and the<br />\nrest of the crew worry a lot<br />\nabout Hopkins: its landscaping,<br />\ngrass, and general appearance.<br />\nStan Wisnom is the foreman<br />\nfor the group of men who are in<br />\ncharge of the grounds at<br />\nHomewood, and his office<br />\nunderneath the stands of the<br />\nfootball field has lockers and<br />\nseed catalogues instead of books<br />\nfrom the library.<br />\nRight now, they're trying to<br />\ndecide what to do about the grass<br />\ngrowing in front of the<br />\nPresident's house.

He hit for the first Blue<br />\nJay points on two foul shots, and then added a<br />\nbasket, a foul shot and another basket before<br />\nbreaking the four figure plateau. With 7:47<br />\nremaining in the half, he was fouled and went to<br />\nthe line to shoot two foul shots. After missing<br />\nthe first free throw, he connected on the second<br /><br />\nand the game was momentarily halted by a one<br />\nminute ovation. He was then presented the game<br />\nball.<br />\nAs the second half began, the poise, polish and<br />\nclass of the Loyola team became evident. They<br />\nscored the first eleven points of the period and<br />\neighteen of the first twenty-two. The six point<br />\nBlue Jay halftime lead was transformed into an<br />\neight point Loyola bulge and the lead continued<br />\nto widen. After the Blue Jays closed the gap to<br />\nfour midway through the half, Loyola broke the<br />\ngame open and led by as many as eighteen.<br />\nThe second half was a combination of sloppy<br />\nHopkins play and a tremendous Loyola defensive<br />\neffort. The Greyhound overplaying defense and<br />\nsuperb boxing out on rebounds shut the Blue Jay<br />\noffense off. Bill Jews, who turned in a fine first<br />\nhalf, was held to a single point and few rebounds<br />\nafter intermission. The lone bright spot of the<br />\nsecond half was Gary Handleman's thirteen<br />\npoints raising his career total to 1017 with one<br />\ngame remaining.<br /><br />\n1, tomnii<br /><br />\nHandlenzan goes in for layup.<br /><br />\nIndoor track prepares for AAU South Atlantics<br />\nBy GERRY GREENFIELD<br />\nDeliberately ignoring snow,<br />\nblizzard and gale warnings,<br />\nmembers of the Blue Jay indoor<br />\ntrack team have been continuing<br />\nto work out. In recent weeks,<br />\nhowever, the efforts of Hopkins'<br />\nrunners have fallen just short of<br />\nwinning.<br />\nIn a meet at Essex Community<br />\nCollege on February 5th, Boe<br />\nWalker finished fourth in the<br />\nsixty yard high hurdles.

Walker finally crossed thc<br />\nfinish line with a time of 8.2<br />\nseconds, far from his best time.<br />\nMeanwhile, in the 50-yard<br />\ndash, Mark Cummings won his<br />\ntrial heat with a time of 5.8<br />\nseconds. In the semi-finals,<br />\nhowever, Mark finished a close<br />\nsecond, which prevented him<br />\nfrom getting good lane position<br />\nin the finals of that race.<br />\nOn February 18th, at Towson<br />\nState, Hopkins managed to place<br />\nonly one person in the<br />\nAll-Corners meet.<br />\nOn a long version of a<br />\nbasketball court, high hurdlers,<br />\nBoe Walker and Gerry<br />\nGreenfield, both failed to make<br />\nthe finals. Similarly, in the high<br />\njump event, defendingchampion<br />\nGerry Greenfield was only able<br />\nto place a distant third, as he<br />\nfailed to clear a height of six feet<br />\non a series of near misses.<br />\nNevertheless, when asked<br /><br />\nabout the team's progress so far,<br />\nCoach Don Masken was very<br />\noptimistic. According to him, the<br />\nexperience gained by members of<br />\nthe indoor team will enable them<br />\nto assist members of the spring<br />\ntrack team. This experience<br />\ncoupled with several returning<br /><br />\nveterans and talented freshmen<br />\nshould make this year's spring<br />\nteam that much better, in<br />\nMasken's view.<br />\nThe indoor track team,<br />\nthough, still has three more<br />\nmeets, the two most important<br />\nones occurring early in March.<br /><br />\nThe first of these is the AAU<br />\nSouth Atlantic Association<br />\nIndoor Championships, which<br />\nwill be held March 3rd, at the<br />\nFifth Regiment Armory. The<br />\nsecond, and the more important<br />\nof the two meets from a team<br />\npoint of view, is the MAC Indoor<br /><br />\nChampionships, scheduled to be<br />\nheld March I 1 th at Swarthmore<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nLast year in this meet,<br />\nHopkins entered three freshmen.<br />\nWith a larger and more<br />\nexperienced squad, the Jays hope<br />\nto do better this year.<br /><br />\nsports briefs<br />\nFencing<br />\nLast Tuesday night, the varsity<br />\nfencing team made a strong<br />\nshowing against the Salle Palasz<br />\nfencing club of Baltimore,<br />\nwinning the contest by a score of<br />\n20-7.<br />\nGlenn Pantel and John<br />\nBurdakin each won three bouts<br />\nas they led the foil team to an<br />\n8-1 victory.

All of the jv foilmen were<br />\nincluded in this pool, except for<br />\nBelsky, even though Belsky has<br />\nbeaten all of these men in<br />\npractice and has expressed the<br />\nopinion that he may have more<br />\npotential than them.<br />\nAccording to Coach Oles,<br />\nthough, Belsky does not have as<br />\nmuch ability as the others, as can<br />\nbe shown by his 1-4 record in<br />\noutside bouts. In response to a<br />\nquestion about Belsky's<br />\nperformance in regular workouts,<br />\nOles replied, \"Practices don't<br />\nreally show you anything. When<br />\nyou work out with the same<br />\npeople day after day, you get to<br />\nknow each other's moves and, as<br />\na result, you can't really judge<br />\nfrom this type of results. You<br />\nreally have to look at his outside<br />\nperformance, and his 1-4 record<br />\njust isn't good enough to be on<br />\nthe varsity pool. I cut five or six<br />\nother boys from the varsity pool<br />\ntoo, who have fenced longer than<br />\nBelsky ever did, so I don't think<br />\nI'm really discriminating.\"<br />\nWhether or not Oles is<br />\ndiscriminating against Belsky,<br />\nthere has been another recent<br />\ndevelopment, which seems to<br />\nfurther hinder Belsky's chances<br />\nof making the varsity team next<br /><br />\nyear. This was the team's<br />\ndecision to again adopt the<br />\npolicy that \"any experienced<br />\nupperclassman who does not<br />\nmake the varsity will no longer<br />\nbe able to fence.\"<br />\nCoach Oles claims that this<br />\npolicy is nothing really new,<br />\nsince the jv team (except for this<br />\npast season) was always made up<br />\nof \"people who had never fenced<br />\nbefore and those experienced<br />\nfreshmen who were being given a<br />\ntrial run.\"<br />\nOles had never felt this policy<br />\nto be discriminatory since, from<br />\na common sense point of view,<br />\nhe can only accomodate as many<br />\npeople on the varsity as he has<br />\nuniforms. \"I try to keep as many<br />\nexperienced people as I can,<br />\nespecially those I feel have a<br />\ncertain minimum amount of<br />\nfencing ability. The others, for<br />\nwhom I cannot supply uniforms<br />\nanyway, I consider deadwood.<br />\nFurthermore, I don't like to put<br />\nthese men back on jv, since they<br />\nadversely affect the performance<br />\nof those who have never fenced<br />\nbefore and who need special<br />\nteaching.\"<br />\nAccording to Oles, Belsky<br />\nwould qualify as an \"experienced<br />\nupperclassman\" next year, since<br />\nhe has fenced in high school, and<br />\nsince he has worked out most of<br />\nthe season with the Graduate<br />\nStudent Fencing Club (thus<br />\ngetting experience while not<br />\nreally being on the varsity).<br />\nIn effect, it looks like Belsky's<br />\nchances \"are nil\" for continuing<br />\nhis fencing next year, simply due<br />\nto what Coach Oles claims is \"his<br />\nlack of ability.\"<br /><br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br />\n\"The MAC is in the bag.\"<br />\nComfort, however, is by no<br />\nJohns Hopkins' high-flying<br />\nswimmers last night began their<br />\nmeans willing to sit on his<br />\ndefense of the first of two laurels of snaring a pair of easy<br />\nconference titles at the opening conference titles or compiling a<br />\nsession of the Mason-Dixon<br />\n13-2 dual meet record over such<br />\ntournament at Towson State.<br />\nswimming non-powers as Loyola,<br />\nThe meet, scheduled to Towson,PMC,and the like.<br />\ncontinue through tomorrow<br />\n\"I could say, 'We were great,<br />\nnight, sees the Blue Jays firmly<br />\nwe were 13-2,' but that would be<br />\ninstalled as solid favorites to<br />\nridiculous; we knew we were<br />\nretain the championship they going to be 13-2 before the<br />\nwrestled from Catholic season started.
