Brubeck, to many the<br />\nMainstay of progressive jazz, has garnered international acclaim in recognition for his contribution to<br />\nlaze.<br />\nThe Baltimore City Ballet will present their program<br />\nat classical and modern dance Sunday night at 8:30'<br />\nP.M. also at Shrivel.. The five-year old company congists of 25 dancers and is Baltimore's only dance organization.<br />\nThe Ballet group appearing Sunday will include<br />\nvisiting artists from the Metropolitan Opera and Manhattan Festival Ballet Companies. The production will<br />\nbe under the direction of Danny Diamond.<br />\nJazz buffs tonight will be treated to improvisation<br />\nend polyrhythms. Brubeck believes that improvisation<br />\nIs the heart of jazz. Brubeck thinks that jazz can be<br />\nWritten, and that ultimately the dividing line between<br />\nClassical music and jazz will disappear.<br />\nThe Brubeck Quartet is well known for its successes<br />\nIn the Time series of albums, \"Time Out,\" \"Time<br />\nPurther Out,\" and \"Count Down Time in Outer<br />\nSpace.\" It IS in these recordings in which the jazz<br />\nstsartet experiences polyrhythms.<br />\nAlong with Brubeck will appear Paul Desmond on<br />\nidto sax, Joe Morello as percussionist, and Gene<br />\nWright on bass. Brubeck pounds on the piano. Each<br />\nitl( the other members of the Brubeck Quartet are famous in their own right.<br />\nThe program to be presented to ballet lovers Sunday<br />\nWill include several Brahms waltzes, described by Diamond as \"romantic in style and feeling, and classicai<br />\nIn technique.\"<br />\nAlso presented will be Children's Corner by Claude<br />\nDebussey, seen as \"classical ballet with some modern.<br />\nOne is stylized and contrasted against a more modern<br />\none,\" explains Diamond. The Jazz Suite done to the<br />\nmusic of Robert Prince and a period piece by Mozart<br />\nWill round out the program.<br />\nDiamond describes romanticism as a form in ballet<br />\nma characterized by toe dancing and white filmy<br />\ndrosses. \"Poses and forms are important in this kind<br />\nOf dance.\" Naturalism is described by Diamond as<br />\n4'people doing as they really do. It is a rebirth of expression, but for a whole group rather than one<br />\ndancer.\"<br />\nModern dance is seen by the director of the Baltimore City Ballet Company as a \"reaction to the impulse of the music. The different eras of the dance is<br />\nsimply a philosophical difference. Modem dance is a<br />\nresult of meaning inside the dancer rather than Victorian representation of the romantic.\"<br />\nTickets for the ballet are available at the YMCA<br />\noffice and Fred Walker's Music Store for $1, $1.50,<br />\nand $2.<br />\n<br />\n\"B.

Final figures will be published<br />\nIn next week's News-Letter.<br />\nThe committee, under the co-chairmanship of Barbara Ellis, a graduate student in Chemistry, Thomas<br />\nCarpenter, and Dr. Philip Hartman of Biology, expects the final total to be higher than the original<br />\ngoal of $8,000. Dr. Hartman sent a letter to his faculty<br />\nsolicitors indicating that the committee hoped to be<br />\nable to raise $12,000, and thus send three underprivileged students to Hopkins rather than two.<br />\nStudent Contributions Low<br />\nThis opthnism is due to the fact that the bulk of<br />\nthe contributions so far have come from relatively few<br />\nsources. Only five departments in the faculty have<br />\ncontributed on an organized basis, Biology, Romance<br />\nLanguages, Biophysics, Chemistry, and Philosophy.<br />\nThe Humanities and Social Sciences have not as yet<br />\nresponded to the solicitations. Students themselves<br />\nhave contributed very little, with only $1,000 coming<br />\nfrom students, and most of these contributors have<br />\nbeen graduate students.<br />\nThe lack of undergraduate participation is partly<br />\nattributed to the fact that the undergraduate solicitation was delayed until this week.<br />\nThe letters that were to be distributed to the offcampus students could not be given out. The Post<br />\nOffice has recently refused to allow the stuffing of the<br />\nmail boxes in Gilman Hall. All mail must have a name<br />\nand box number on it, and the committee did not have<br />\nthe manpower necessary to perform this task.<br />\nSandy Cohn, who recently took charge of undergraduate solicitation, is expected to take action in the<br />\nnear future to increase the student participation on<br />\nthe drive.<br />\n\"Syracuse\" Contributes<br />\nLast weekend's performance of The Boys from Syracuse aided the drive.

But no: this, I<br />\nimagine, would require a modicum of imagination,<br />\nvision even; and this, one can bet any ranch on, is<br />\none thing of which we can be sure the talented organizers of this weekend have not even the -slightest<br />\nconception.

Poor graduate instruction, insufficient course offerings in most departments, the small size of the teaching faculty, and incompetent advising have been lamented before. In the<br />\nrecently compiled Report of the Undergraduate Committee for Curriculum Studies, its authors have successfully laid bare the relationship between these problems<br />\nand the general Hopkins approach to education, also providing concrete suggestions for improving the situation.<br />\nBecause the departments are extremely graduatebriented, and due to the demands of the \"publish or<br />\nperish\" doctrine, the attention of the faculty is diverted,<br />\nnot unwillingly, from the undergraduate student body.<br />\nFurthermore, the Report states, \"proposals that the administration act to alter this imbalance involves a transgression of the traditional departmental autonomy. Most<br />\nfaculty members feel that such autonomy should remain<br />\nbecause it preserves the freedom of the scholar.\" Many<br />\nadministrators, we might add, go along with this philosophy.<br />\nWhile this approach embodies the \"uniqueness\"<br />\nof Hopkins, some modification is presently called for.<br />\nThe administration will he characteristicly slow to react, although the combination of the Schools of Philosophy and Engineering Science into one School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences suggests that interdepartmental communication could improve, facilitating changes in basic academic requirements and scheduling, and encouraging<br />\nthe establishment of more interdepartmental courses.<br />\nMore importantly, the administration could encourage<br />\nprofessors to teach more courses by awarding promotions to good teachers as well as by increasing their<br />\naalaries.<br />\nFor any real improvement to take place, however,<br />\nthe faculty in the various departments will have to<br />\nmodify their views in favor of increased teaching responsibilities. Only in this way can qualified and interested graduate students receive the opportunity to teach<br />\nspecialized courses in their particular fields, as has been<br />\nsuggested, thus helping to alleviate the shortage of<br />\ncourses. More thorough supervision and coordination<br />\nof graduate instructors also requires the belief by professors that the effort is worth it. There is no reason why<br />\nthe departments on their own cannot effect the necessary<br />\nchanges, if they are but willing to employ the current<br />\ndepartmental system more flexibly.<br />\nDealing with departments individually and directly<br />\nproved a successful approach to the Undergraduate<br />\nCommittee on Curriculum Studies in writing its report.<br />\nProfessors were both frank and at least open to ideas.<br />\nIn continuing to follow this approach, the Committee<br />\nmay find the departments more responsive to the suggestions proposed in its Report.<br />\nThe Committee itself currently hold ad hoe status,<br />\nview of its accomplishments to date, there seems<br />\nin<br />\nand<br />\nto he no reason to change it. Its greatest asset is the fact<br />\nthat it is composed of concerned and informed individuals. It would be a mistake to destroy its influence by<br />\nmaking it a political plum for either the Student Council<br />\nor the administration.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, APRIL 29,<br />\n<br />\nMe<br />\n<br />\nlite alkonewaaci Scene<br />\nWEEKEND WEAKENED<br />\n<br />\nBy HENRY M.

Withdrawal or escalation<br />\nwill not be the main issue,<br />\nthough. Since all the Republican<br />\ncandidates will be patriotic<br />\nAmericans, their strategy will<br />\nnot be to undermine the war<br />\neffort. The issue will center<br />\naround what Ambass:sador Goldberg confusingly calls the \"credi-<br />\n<br />\nbility gap.\" In simple terms this<br />\nmeans one's confidence or lack<br />\nof confidence in the government's<br />\ndetermination to carry out a<br />\npolicy which it talks about.<br />\nThe limited war in South Viet<br />\nNam has lost much of its limited<br />\ncharacter. The supply of career<br />\nsoldiers, high school drop-outs,<br />\nand voluntary enlistees has been<br />\nused up.

As more men<br />\nare touched by the war, a higher<br />\ninterest in our Viet Nam policy<br />\nwill develop.<br />\nRepublicans must be very<br />\ncareful and avoid reckless statements on this most serious international problem. Republicans<br />\nshould look back to the legacy<br />\nof the Eisenhower and Nixon<br />\nyears for advise on the war issue.<br />\nIn those 8 years, not only was<br />\npeace maintained, but where<br />\nlimited troop action was needed<br />\nIt was carried out with dispatch<br />\nand success (Lebanon). In situations where long term stalemate<br />\nwars or unbearable political<br />\ntensions would result, Eisenhower and Nixon restrained<br />\nthemselves (Hungary). John<br />\nFoster Dulles preached \"brinkmanship\" everywhere, but used<br />\n<br />\nnuclear weapons and bombs nowhere.<br />\nGeography and logistics are<br />\nworking against the U.S. in Viet<br />\nNam as well as internal political<br />\ntrouble. But these difficulties<br />\nshould have been assessed before<br />\nthe first U.S. adviser was killed<br />\nthere in December, 1961. Obviously many mistakes were<br />\nmade, especially concerning the<br />\nDiem government. As the Republicans fielded a candidate in<br />\n1952 who was able to end conflict in Korea in an honorable<br />\nfashion, so they may again in<br />\n1968.<br />\nIronically in the Presidential<br />\ncampaign of 1960, Richard Nixon<br />\nchose to stand and fight on the<br />\nforeign policy issue. Unfortunately, Quemoy and Matsu. Cuba,<br />\nHungary, and Lebanon did not<br />\nstimulate the people. The nonexistent missile gap held the<br />\nstage as the defense issue.<br />\nThe Nixon legacy on foreign<br />\naffairs is strikingly related by<br />\nTheodore White in his book,<br />\n<br />\nDO YOU HAVE<br />\nWHAT IT<br />\nTAKES TO BE<br />\nA LEADER?*<br />\n*If you do, don't settle for less.'<br />\n<br />\ncollege this spring'<br />\nIf you will complete your first two years of<br />\nand have not had ROTC training, you now have a special<br />\nopportunity to earn an Army officer's commission in the next<br />\ntwo years.

In the meeting by which a<br />\nVice-Presidential candidate was<br />\nchosen, there was a disagreement<br />\nas to whether the candidate<br />\nshould be knowledgeable in<br />\ndomestic or foreign policy. Governor Stratton of Illinois said:<br />\n\"You can say all you want to<br />\nabout foreign affairs, but what's<br />\nreally important is the price of<br />\nhogs in Chicago and St. Louis.'<br />\nNixon declared, \"If you ever let<br />\nthem the Democrats) campaign<br />\nonly on domestic issues, they'll<br />\nbeat us\u2014our only hope is to<br />\nkeep it on foreign policy.\"<br />\nTheodore White relates a<br />\nmemorable speech of Nixon's at<br />\nPeachtree Street and Hurt Park<br />\nin Atlanta, Georgia on August<br />\n26, 1960.

When a team saw itself<br />\ndefeated 65-16, in basketball for<br />\nInstance, it was difficult for<br />\nthem to get a team out the next<br />\nweek. Fortunately, throughout<br />\nthe season there were only a<br />\nminimum number of games forfeited but this, I think, can only<br />\nbe written off as lucky.<br />\nNow, perhaps, we owe a<br />\nthanks to the brothers of TEP<br />\nfor showing us that interest,<br />\nabove and beyond athletic abilities, can win games too.<br />\n<br />\n111111111111111\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nGOOD THINGS COME<br />\nAND GOOD TIIINGS GO<br />\nBecause the good food at the<br />\nHarry Little Carry-Out Shops<br />\nMake it so!<br />\n<br />\nAfter<br />\nupending Gettysburg<br />\nCollege 5-4 on April 20, the varsity netmen picked off defending<br />\nMason-Dixon champs Loyola,<br />\n1 2.<br />\n5/<br />\n2-3/<br />\n1<br />\nThe victory, Hopkins' third in<br />\na row and third in three days,<br />\nboosted their season record, 3-3,<br />\nand their conference record to<br />\n2-1.<br />\nThe Loyola victory, the first<br />\nover the Greyhounds in four<br />\nyears, was highlighted by a four<br />\nset sweep of the two completed<br />\ndoubles matches and the overpowering singles play of Bob<br />\nChilders.

Brubeck believes that improvisation<br />\nIs the heart of jazz. Brubeck thinks that jazz can be<br />\nWritten, and that ultimately the dividing line between<br />\nClassical music and jazz will disappear.<br />\nThe Brubeck Quartet is well known for its successes<br />\nIn the Time series of albums, \"Time Out,\" \"Time<br />\nPurther Out,\" and \"Count Down Time in Outer<br />\nSpace.\" It IS in these recordings in which the jazz<br />\nstsartet experiences polyrhythms.<br />\nAlong with Brubeck will appear Paul Desmond on<br />\nidto sax, Joe Morello as percussionist, and Gene<br />\nWright on bass.

The Jazz Suite done to the<br />\nmusic of Robert Prince and a period piece by Mozart<br />\nWill round out the program.<br />\nDiamond describes romanticism as a form in ballet<br />\nma characterized by toe dancing and white filmy<br />\ndrosses. \"Poses and forms are important in this kind<br />\nOf dance.\" Naturalism is described by Diamond as<br />\n4'people doing as they really do. It is a rebirth of expression, but for a whole group rather than one<br />\ndancer.\"<br />\nModern dance is seen by the director of the Baltimore City Ballet Company as a \"reaction to the impulse of the music. The different eras of the dance is<br />\nsimply a philosophical difference. Modem dance is a<br />\nresult of meaning inside the dancer rather than Victorian representation of the romantic.\"<br />\nTickets for the ballet are available at the YMCA<br />\noffice and Fred Walker's Music Store for $1, $1.50,<br />\nand $2.<br /><br />\n\"B.

Final figures will be published<br />\nIn next week's News-Letter.<br />\nThe committee, under the co-chairmanship of Barbara Ellis, a graduate student in Chemistry, Thomas<br />\nCarpenter, and Dr. Philip Hartman of Biology, expects the final total to be higher than the original<br />\ngoal of $8,000. Dr. Hartman sent a letter to his faculty<br />\nsolicitors indicating that the committee hoped to be<br />\nable to raise $12,000, and thus send three underprivileged students to Hopkins rather than two.<br />\nStudent Contributions Low<br />\nThis opthnism is due to the fact that the bulk of<br />\nthe contributions so far have come from relatively few<br />\nsources. Only five departments in the faculty have<br />\ncontributed on an organized basis, Biology, Romance<br />\nLanguages, Biophysics, Chemistry, and Philosophy.<br />\nThe Humanities and Social Sciences have not as yet<br />\nresponded to the solicitations. Students themselves<br />\nhave contributed very little, with only $1,000 coming<br />\nfrom students, and most of these contributors have<br />\nbeen graduate students.<br />\nThe lack of undergraduate participation is partly<br />\nattributed to the fact that the undergraduate solicitation was delayed until this week.<br />\nThe letters that were to be distributed to the offcampus students could not be given out. The Post<br />\nOffice has recently refused to allow the stuffing of the<br />\nmail boxes in Gilman Hall. All mail must have a name<br />\nand box number on it, and the committee did not have<br />\nthe manpower necessary to perform this task.<br />\nSandy Cohn, who recently took charge of undergraduate solicitation, is expected to take action in the<br />\nnear future to increase the student participation on<br />\nthe drive.<br />\n\"Syracuse\" Contributes<br />\nLast weekend's performance of The Boys from Syracuse aided the drive.

But no: this, I<br />\nimagine, would require a modicum of imagination,<br />\nvision even; and this, one can bet any ranch on, is<br />\none thing of which we can be sure the talented organizers of this weekend have not even the -slightest<br />\nconception.

Poor graduate instruction, insufficient course offerings in most departments, the small size of the teaching faculty, and incompetent advising have been lamented before. In the<br />\nrecently compiled Report of the Undergraduate Committee for Curriculum Studies, its authors have successfully laid bare the relationship between these problems<br />\nand the general Hopkins approach to education, also providing concrete suggestions for improving the situation.<br />\nBecause the departments are extremely graduatebriented, and due to the demands of the \"publish or<br />\nperish\" doctrine, the attention of the faculty is diverted,<br />\nnot unwillingly, from the undergraduate student body.<br />\nFurthermore, the Report states, \"proposals that the administration act to alter this imbalance involves a transgression of the traditional departmental autonomy. Most<br />\nfaculty members feel that such autonomy should remain<br />\nbecause it preserves the freedom of the scholar.\" Many<br />\nadministrators, we might add, go along with this philosophy.<br />\nWhile this approach embodies the \"uniqueness\"<br />\nof Hopkins, some modification is presently called for.<br />\nThe administration will he characteristicly slow to react, although the combination of the Schools of Philosophy and Engineering Science into one School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences suggests that interdepartmental communication could improve, facilitating changes in basic academic requirements and scheduling, and encouraging<br />\nthe establishment of more interdepartmental courses.<br />\nMore importantly, the administration could encourage<br />\nprofessors to teach more courses by awarding promotions to good teachers as well as by increasing their<br />\naalaries.<br />\nFor any real improvement to take place, however,<br />\nthe faculty in the various departments will have to<br />\nmodify their views in favor of increased teaching responsibilities. Only in this way can qualified and interested graduate students receive the opportunity to teach<br />\nspecialized courses in their particular fields, as has been<br />\nsuggested, thus helping to alleviate the shortage of<br />\ncourses. More thorough supervision and coordination<br />\nof graduate instructors also requires the belief by professors that the effort is worth it. There is no reason why<br />\nthe departments on their own cannot effect the necessary<br />\nchanges, if they are but willing to employ the current<br />\ndepartmental system more flexibly.<br />\nDealing with departments individually and directly<br />\nproved a successful approach to the Undergraduate<br />\nCommittee on Curriculum Studies in writing its report.<br />\nProfessors were both frank and at least open to ideas.<br />\nIn continuing to follow this approach, the Committee<br />\nmay find the departments more responsive to the suggestions proposed in its Report.<br />\nThe Committee itself currently hold ad hoe status,<br />\nview of its accomplishments to date, there seems<br />\nin<br />\nand<br />\nto he no reason to change it. Its greatest asset is the fact<br />\nthat it is composed of concerned and informed individuals. It would be a mistake to destroy its influence by<br />\nmaking it a political plum for either the Student Council<br />\nor the administration.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, APRIL 29,<br /><br />\nMe<br /><br />\nlite alkonewaaci Scene<br />\nWEEKEND WEAKENED<br /><br />\nBy HENRY M.

It is<br />\nobvious that some houses have<br />\nteams than<br />\nstronger<br />\nmuch<br />\nothers. But, this was not the<br />\nproblem. When a team saw itself<br />\ndefeated 65-16, in basketball for<br />\nInstance, it was difficult for<br />\nthem to get a team out the next<br />\nweek. Fortunately, throughout<br />\nthe season there were only a<br />\nminimum number of games forfeited but this, I think, can only<br />\nbe written off as lucky.<br />\nNow, perhaps, we owe a<br />\nthanks to the brothers of TEP<br />\nfor showing us that interest,<br />\nabove and beyond athletic abilities, can win games too.<br /><br />\n111111111111111\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nGOOD THINGS COME<br />\nAND GOOD TIIINGS GO<br />\nBecause the good food at the<br />\nHarry Little Carry-Out Shops<br />\nMake it so!<br /><br />\nAfter<br />\nupending Gettysburg<br />\nCollege 5-4 on April 20, the varsity netmen picked off defending<br />\nMason-Dixon champs Loyola,<br />\n1 2.<br />\n5/<br />\n2-3/<br />\n1<br />\nThe victory, Hopkins' third in<br />\na row and third in three days,<br />\nboosted their season record, 3-3,<br />\nand their conference record to<br />\n2-1.<br />\nThe Loyola victory, the first<br />\nover the Greyhounds in four<br />\nyears, was highlighted by a four<br />\nset sweep of the two completed<br />\ndoubles matches and the overpowering singles play of Bob<br />\nChilders.
