The<br />\nprinted word has to make an immediate<br />\nImpression in the reader's mind to gain<br />\nsome semblance of permanence.<br />\nMy words will be scattered about like<br />\nthe water spraying from one of those<br />\nsprinklers which turn around and around.<br />\nI hope you get wet.<br />\n12:28 a.m., Atlanta Airport. The<br />\nmidnight shuttle to Baltimore is not<br />\nprime time but it is definitely prime<br />\n13awlanier. The moment I entered the<br />\ncramped airplane and glanced at the<br />\nvarious faces eyeing me from their seats, I<br />\nknew I was on my way to Baltimore. An<br />\noverwhelming feeling of pure RAUNCH<br />\ne nveloped me. I don't say this as an<br />\ninsult. Some of my best friends are<br />\nraunch y, Baltimore is one of the great<br />\nRAUNCH centers of the world. Don't let<br />\nthis scare you. It is a merely a front for<br />\neven raunchier, and more exciting, things.<br />\nThis was my first time in Baltimore<br />\nbefore school opened (I don't think<br />\nnineteen years ago when I was born at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital counts) and<br />\nthe very next night some mates and I<br />\ndecided to walk around and enjoy the<br />\nHopkins campus on a cool summer night<br />\nafter a rain. Our rationale was complete<br />\nand insane: we were card-carryingmembers of the club, (fingering our<br />\nHopkins identification). So what if the<br />\nclub didn't open until September 1st?<br />\nThere is a great deal to be said for the<br />\nCampus almost completely devoid of<br />\nPeople.<br />\nHopkins is a very beautiful place. You<br />\nstep off the streets of Baltimore,<br />\nPicturesquely decorated with slums and<br />\nthe old, and you may enjoy the quiet of a<br />\nsmall forest, the solemnity, or maybe<br />\nagony, of academia reflected by buildings<br />\nOld and new, or the strange ultra-modern<br />\ndecadence of the Student Union. The<br />\nGlass Pavilion, oddly enough, is most<br />\nImpressive when it is completely empty.<br />\n\"But what does it matter?\"<br />\nWhen I came to the Hop last year, I<br />\nconstantly found myself in conflict with<br />\nsomeone or something. My roommate<br />\nand I discovered we made the Odd<br />\nCouple Jo ok very compatible. The<br />\ntensions rose until one night we both<br />\nexploded, and if not for the reasonability<br />\nof a roommate three times my size, I<br />\ntbight not be here writing this article. We<br />\n<br />\neach wanted the other to leave, but the<br />\nidea of ourselves moving was out of the<br />\nquestion. Both of us knew there was no<br />\nbetter place to go. What developed was<br />\nan intense respect for each other and a<br />\nvery close friendship.<br />\nMy relationship with the University<br />\ngrew in much the same way. After<br />\nbecoming fed up with a non-existent<br />\nCommunication department, a radio<br />\nstation which almost everyone refused to<br />\ntake seriously, and a social life, or lack<br />\nthereof, which was driving me crackers, I<br />\nbecame determined to transfer.<br />\nSticking my nose into the directories<br />\nof other universities, I noticed what. I<br />\nwould lose by leaving the Hop. It would<br />\nbe difficult to find a comparable<br />\nacademic institution as small as Hopkins.<br />\nIt would be unlikely to find a place with<br />\nsuch easy accessibility to professors,<br />\nespecially the famous ones. And it would<br />\nbe impossible to find a school which<br />\nencourages so much freedom. I am<br />\nconvinced you can do anything you want<br />\nhere as long as you can find a faculty<br />\nmember to approve it, and sometmes<br />\neven that is unneccesary.<br />\nSo I stayed. I'm happy I did. The club<br />\nis home to me. But enough with this P.R.<br />\ngame. I don't have to sell you on the<br />\nHop. After all, you're stuck here for at<br />\nleast one semester, probably two.<br />\nMost of you will be living in the<br />\nAlumni Memorial Residences, or as they<br />\nare affectionately known: \"the dorms.\" I<br />\nstill do not understand why this housing<br />\ndevelopment receives such abuse from<br />\nmost of the Hopkins community, that is<br />\nthe student community. Most of the<br />\n<br />\nrooms in the dormitories have an<br />\nunbelievable amount of storage space.<br />\nWith a bit of thought, your cubicle can<br />\nbe turned into a very comfortable place<br />\nto live. And, last winter, the dorms were<br />\nlike living in a sauna bath. But the best<br />\nthing of all is the total freedom. Even<br />\noutside in the \"real world\" you probably<br />\nwill not have the complete liberty to be<br />\nwho you want to be and do what you<br />\nwant to do, short of murder and<br />\naggravated rape. The University says you<br />\nare young adults quite capable of running<br />\nyour own lives, and gives you the<br />\nenvironment to do it in.<br />\nLast year I truly felt that my class did<br />\nnot take full advantage of the situation.<br />\nMost of them seemed completely<br />\nobsessed with the paranoia that they<br />\nwould not make it academically. This<br />\nmore than likely detracted from doing<br />\nwell in the classroom. In the end, it was<br />\nlike something only Ionesco could have<br />\nwritten. Example: The term \"throat\"<br />\nhere at Hopkins refers to those who are<br />\nconstantly studying. The image being one<br />\nwho shoves knowledge down his throat,<br />\nso to speak. The night before a Chemistry<br />\nexam, a friend of mine felt it imperative<br />\nnot to be disturbed\u2014understandably\u2014and<br />\nput a sign on her door reading, \"DEEP<br />\nTHROATING IN PROGRESS. DO NOT<br />\nDISTURB.\" What strikes me even more is<br />\nthat no one commented or scribbled<br />\nsome homey obscenity On the sign.<br />\nIt wasn't all dead seriousness, though. I<br />\nremember vividly seeing a somewhat<br />\ninebriated friend of mine climb atop a<br />\nsculpture, urinate profusely, and scream<br />\nto those of us below, as befuddled<br />\n<br />\npassers-by watched, \"Why don't we go<br />\nhack to Towson State?!\" The Hopkins<br />\nstudent will find his identity by denying<br />\nit.<br />\nDon't forget Baltimore either. The<br />\ndowntown area is a striking contrast<br />\nbetween the very old and very new.<br />\nDon't be afraid of the city like I was.<br />\nBaltimore is now in, if I may borrow a<br />\ndescription by another Hoppie, a<br />\n\"Renaissance.\" The city is being reborn<br />\nwith the help of the poor, the freaks,<br />\nand, hopefully, the college community.<br />\nBecause that's all that is left. The<br />\nexcursion outside the ivory tower can be<br />\npainful, but very rewarding.<br />\n<br />\nThe whole situation is what you make<br />\nit. You can retreat into obscurity and<br />\nbecome the mystery person to everyone<br />\nbut yourself. Or, you can take a few<br />\nchances, probably make an occasional<br />\nfool of yourself, but come out with a<br />\nlittle something for it.<br />\nRight now, my idea of fun and games<br />\nat the Hop is to go to the Rathskellar and<br />\nsee if you can get picked up, no matter<br />\nwhat your sex. The suspense will kill you.<br />\nGo ahead and get oriented. Don't<br />\nforget that Orientation will be the last<br />\ntime before Christmas for you to<br />\nthoroughly enjoy yourself without the<br />\nnagging thought of that next paper due.<br />\nBut it's all up to you. Believe me.<br />\nNobody is going to bother to know you<br />\nunless you make them.<br />\nYou are now a member of the club,<br />\ntoo.

David<br />\nJones, a Welsh hermit, settled beside<br />\nJones Falls (a sewer flowing into the<br />\nPatapsco, now covered by an expressway)<br />\nin 1664, after he was exiled from<br />\nAnnapolis for \"having no visible means of<br />\nsupport.\" Jones learned from 'friendly<br />\nIndians how to brew beer, which he<br />\nsmuggled into Annapolis occasionally out<br />\nof a desire for revenge. This brew, which<br />\nhas been marketed under a variety of<br />\nnames, the most recent trademark being<br />\n\"National Bohemian\", is everything a<br />\ngreat beer should be without being a<br />\ngreat beer.<br />\nThe proprietors of the Maryland<br />\ncolony saw the potential for a great port<br />\ncity at the site of the hamlet of<br />\nJonestown (several other members of the<br />\nAnnapolis lumpenproletariat had joined<br />\nDavid Jones' operation and had formed a<br />\nsmall community of depravity). In 1729<br />\nthe town of Baltimore was laid out\u2014in a<br />\nskirmish with the town of Poit Deposit.<br />\n<br />\nBy the time of the American<br />\nRevolution, Baltimore had a population of<br />\nabout 7,000, most of whom were<br />\nengaged in shipbuilding, brewing, milling,<br />\nor smuggling. The smuggling honchos<br />\nbecame the town's aristocracy. In spite of<br />\nBritish navigation laws, Baltimore<br />\nclippers (the merchants were so called<br />\nbecause of the high prices they charged,<br />\nnot due to their habit of playing hockey<br />\non the decks of their ships), traded with<br />\nthe West Indies, exchanging their inferior<br />\nflour and beer for slaves and rum.<br />\nBaltimoreans have always been sharp<br />\ntraders. For example, Frank Cashen<br />\nrecently swapped an ailing Dave McNally<br />\nfor Montreal's Ken Singleton and Mike<br />\nTorrez. This should have been enough,<br />\nincidentally, to guarantee a pennant for<br />\nthe Baltimore Orioles. Unfortunatley, the<br />\nteam neglected to pay off a few umpires<br />\nso they're still behind Boston.<br />\nThe Farce as History<br />\nBut back to the Revolution! A rebel<br />\nregiment called the Maryland Line;<br />\ncoached by Jerry Claiborne, was<br />\norganized. At the Battle of Long Island,<br />\nGeroge Washington deployed the<br />\nMaryland Line (composed mainly of<br />\nBaltimoreans) to hold off the British<br />\nwhile he executed a quarterback sneak<br />\nacross me tast Kiver to safety. George<br />\ngot away, but the Maryland Line was<br />\nalmost wiped out to a man. Ever since,<br />\nBaltimoreans have. nourished a mutinous<br />\nspirit and a distrust for \"big<br />\ngovernment\", even if that government is<br />\na rebel government with an army led by a<br />\nneighbor. They also try to stay out of<br />\nLong Island as much as possible.<br />\nIn gratitude to General Washington,<br />\nthe widows of Baltimore paid for a<br />\nmonument honoring the Virginian to be<br />\nconstructed. Fifty years later, it was<br />\nfinally finished.. Roads, schools, rapid<br />\ntransit systems, and monuments have<br />\nalways taken a long time to get under<br />\n<br />\nway in Baltimore. By the time they are<br />\ncompleted, they are usually obsolete.<br />\nSuch was the case with Baltimore's<br />\nWashington Monument. A short time<br />\nafter it was topped off, Washington, D.C.<br />\nstarted work on its own monument,<br />\nwhich eclipsed the Baltimore version.<br />\nThe Dawn's Early Light<br />\nDuring the War of 1812, the British<br />\nburned Washington, D.C. Just for the hell<br />\nof it, they decided to sail up the<br />\nChesapeake and take care of Baltimore. A<br />\nnearsighted local lawyer named Francis<br />\nScott Key saw a good opportunity to<br />\nmake some profit. With a few friends, he<br />\nrowed out to the British flagship and<br />\ntried to sell the enemy some of the local<br />\nbrew. When the British tasted it, they<br />\nthrew Key and his wares into the brig. At<br />\nthe dawn of September 12, 1814, the<br />\ninebriated F. Scott looked out of his<br />\nporthole, saw the Union Jack flying from<br />\nthe mast of another ship in the British<br />\nsquadron, mistotok it for the American<br />\nflag, and wrote the \"Star-Spangled<br />\nBanner\". /After a British landing party<br />\ntook sick from eating some tainted<br />\ncrabmeat, the foe'si\"haughty host\" lost<br />\ninterest in the battle and sailed away.<br />\nThus, Baltimore escaped destruction<br />\nand was left with a future national<br />\nanthem and a reputation for producing<br />\npurple prose.

To learn<br />\nwhen and where most concerts, the best<br />\nway is to check out the ads in the Sunday<br />\nSun. But a bit of warning: .the most<br />\naccessible auditorium in Baltimore from<br />\nHopkins is the Baltimore Civic Center,<br />\nWhich is a local version of Madison<br />\nSquare Garden (adjusting, of course, for<br />\nthe difference between Baltimore and<br />\nNew York.) The real problem is that the<br />\nacts booked into the Civic Center are<br />\nalmost exclusively either Heavy Metal or<br />\nSoul, which means if you want something<br />\ndifferent you need wheels.<br />\nPainter's Mill in Owings Mills is a very<br />\nnice place to go to, provided you can get<br />\nthere. Although it is accessible by bus,<br />\nthat requires two transfers,<br />\na twenty<br />\nminute walk, and a lot of time spent on<br />\nthe bus. However,<br />\nif you can get out<br />\nthere, you get a small auditorium with a<br />\ngood sound system and stage<br />\nin the<br />\nmiddle of the hall which guarantees<br />\ngoo d visibility (even if you<br />\nsee only<br />\ntheir backs). Acts which played there last<br />\nyear included Bruce Springsteen, Weather<br />\nReport, and Return to Forever.<br />\nStill farther away is Capitol Center,<br />\njust outside of Washington.<br />\nAlthough<br />\nmany big name acts have appeared there<br />\n(Dylan, Clapton, and the Stones, to name<br />\na few), it's a long walk, so get<br />\na<br />\nguaranteed ride before you get tickets.<br />\nFor jazz aficionados, Baltimore has<br />\nOnly one major club, the Left Bank Jazz<br />\nSociety.

The prices are high<br />\n(sometimes records are sold at $6.98 list),<br />\nand the selection is poor. Their mainstay<br />\nis soul and singles (in fact, theirs is the<br />\nlargest singles selection of these three),<br />\nbut if you want to pay $1.25 for singles,<br />\nthat's your business. The store is a 10<br />\nminute walk from Hopkins, going slowly<br />\nand getting lost.<br />\nRecordmasters is a 15 minute walk<br />\nfrom Hopkins, and is well worth it to the<br />\ncollector. Their strongest point is imports<br />\nof all kinds, especially Jazz (including<br />\nECM, Polydor, Steeplechase, and hard to<br />\nfind Cecil Taylors and Anthony<br />\nBraxtons), and Classical (with a lot of<br />\nEMIs, and considerable depth). They also<br />\nstock DG, Phillips, and<br />\nTelefunken-Argo-Oiseau Lyre (at $5.96),<br />\nand there's usually a label sale going on in<br />\nthe Classics. They also get new releases<br />\nvery early.<br />\nRecord and Tape Collector ( a 20<br />\nminute walk from JHU) is the oldest<br />\nrecord store in Baltimore, and their Cold<br />\nSpring Lane store is the largest. In fact,<br />\nits size is almost detrimental. They have<br />\n<br />\nalmost anything you could want, and a<br />\nabout $5.48 for $6.98 list lps, and the<br />\nlot you couldn't want, and feature the<br />\nstaff and layout (the classical is by<br />\nlargest Classical, Blues, Jazz, and<br />\ncomposer, not catalogue) are helpful,<br />\nHistorical collections in town.

That's<br />\ntoo bad because it makes the best<br />\nbarbeque in the area as well as excellent<br />\nfrench fries and sandwiches. The<br />\natmosphere is perhaps \"Baltimore<br />\nfifties,\" everything is low key, waitresses<br />\nare friendly to all customers and it seems<br />\nthat everyone knows each other in the<br />\ndiner.

Cold cut subs are unappetizing.<br />\nThey make pizza and assorted Italian<br />\ndishes,(lasagna, spaghetti, cacciatore) but<br />\none bite will send you back to New York<br />\nCity for the real thing.

Although not the<br />\nbest restaurant in town, Pecora's is<br />\nconvenient, familiar and a place worth<br />\nchecking out;<br />\nThe White Coffee Pot, E. 32nd and<br />\n<br />\nGreenmount Avenue, is open twenty-four<br />\nhours a day and that is its sole favorable<br />\nfeature. Serving food that ranges from<br />\nfair to-literally sickening, it has waitresses<br />\nwho would as soon drink iced tea and<br />\nsmoke cigarettes as serve you. Never<br />\norder hamburgers coz it ain't the real<br />\nstuff. Breakfasts are mediocre and look<br />\nit. The hotcakes are passable and are the<br />\nsafest bet at this relatively worthless<br />\nrestaurant. The prices are generally<br />\ninexpensive.<br />\nThe Little Tavern, Greenmount and<br />\nThirty-second Street, is part of a<br />\nmid-Atlantic hamburger chain. It takes a<br />\nwhile to get used to the Little Tavern and<br />\nit is probably not for everyone. However,<br />\nif you enjoy drinking morning coffee<br />\nwith an endless crew of regulars this is<br />\nthe place for you. Their menu is spartan:<br />\nsmall and large hamburgers for<br />\ntwenty-five and fifty cents, large pieces<br />\nof above average pie for thirty-five cents,<br />\ndonuts, eclairs and beverages. Coffee,<br />\nwith cream, is their specialty and is good.<br />\nAlso, the Little Tavern is open all day<br />\nand night, with different crowds filtering<br />\nin as the day progresses.<br />\nThe best drugstore in the area is Reeds,<br />\nE. 32nd and Greenmount. The store has<br />\nfrequent sales and an excellent selection<br />\nof ci arettes includi some brands you<br />\n<br />\nprobably never heard of. Package goods<br />\nare sold. Inexpensive prices.<br />\nAt the corner of Thirty-second and<br />\nGreenmount Ave. there is an all-night<br />\nnewsstand, the only one in this part of<br />\nthe city. They have all the New York and<br />\nWashington papers as well as theSun, and<br />\na large selection of grade-B novels. The<br />\nmen who operate the stand are snappish<br />\nand there is definitely nr browsing but<br />\ntraded for the constant availability of<br />\nnews, it's a fair deal.<br />\nThe first edition of the Morning Sun<br />\ncan be bought at eleven p.m. every night.<br />\nOne of the more familiar<br />\nestablishments in the neighborhood is<br />\nJohn Gach's Bookstore, 3322<br />\nGreenmount Ave. Dealing mainly in used<br />\nbooks, Gach's is well stocked and varied,<br />\nif rather expensive. Some paperbacks are<br />\nstill twenty-five cents. Although we<br />\nprefer Allen's Bookshop, John Gach's is<br />\nstill a sensible alternative to the JHU<br />\nBookcenter. Managed by courteous and<br />\nhelpful people, the store also serves as a<br />\nkind of community center and is a<br />\nworthwhile place to spend time.<br />\nThe Open House\u2014located on<br />\nRemington and 29th Street, the Open<br />\nHouse, or OH, is perhaps the original<br />\ngreasy spoon. OH's unsafe location and<br />\nsordid clientele have earned it the<br />\n<br />\nnickname \"Open Wound.\" OH is one of<br />\nthe few all-night establishments in all of<br />\nBaltimore and the only one within<br />\nwalking distance of the Homewood<br />\ncampus. Most of the food is greasy,<br />\nespecially the french fries, but the<br />\nbreakfast combinations are good. Don't<br />\nwalk to OH alone after dark and don't<br />\nworry: that man next to you at the<br />\ncounter is not dead. He is asleep.<br />\nMee-Jun-Low--At 219 W. Mulberry,<br />\nthis Chinese restaurant is one of the few<br />\nrestaurants that is truly cheap and at the<br />\nsame time good. It is informal to the<br />\npoint of being rude, intimate to the point<br />\nof being cramped. Open late and a lot of<br />\nfun.<br />\nHaussner's\u2014located at 3244 Eastern<br />\nAve., this is one of Baltimore's most<br />\nfamous restaurants. For about $5-$8 and<br />\nafter a long wait (no reservations) you<br />\ncan receive high quality food and service.<br />\nSpecializes in German _food, but has all<br />\ntypes.

Once a<br />\nstudent has decided he wants to get out<br />\nand see the city, to visit the museums, to<br />\nattend concerts and shows in the area, he<br />\nshouldn't let transportation or the lack of<br />\nit deter him.<br />\nFive Bus routes border the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. The Metropolitan Bus Service in<br />\nBaltimore, while not the best way to<br />\ntravel, can take the eager wanderer<br />\nfarther than one might expect at a small<br />\ncost (30 cents). Buses in Baltimore are<br />\nfairly reliable in that they stick to their<br />\nschedules. However, the frequency with<br />\nwhich they run (rush-hour excepted) can<br />\noften frustrate the most patient<br />\nexcursionist. Anyone interested in using<br />\nthe buses can call the Metropolitan<br />\nTransit Authority (MTA) to find out<br />\nroutes and schedules for buses and thus<br />\navoid unnecessary delays at the Bus stop.<br />\nAs a rule of thumb, a wait of 15-20<br />\nminutes for a bus during rush hour<br />\nshould be anticipated, twice that amount<br />\nat other times. The waits won't always be<br />\nthat long, depending on the line used, but<br />\ninorder to be sure you'll get where you're<br />\ngoing on time, ample waiting time should<br />\nbe allowed.<br />\nFor those who just want to wander<br />\nvaried<br />\nabout the city and see the<br />\nsights, the city sponsors its \"Super<br />\nSundays.\" For 50 cents, you can ride the<br />\nbuses (all lines) in any direction all day<br />\nSunday. It's a stealoconsidering that the<br />\nregular fare is 30 cents, plus 5 cents for a<br />\ntransfer, 5 cents.- for a zone change for<br />\njust one ride.<br />\nBelow are listed selected places of<br />\ninterest and necessity, with the different<br />\nways to get there.<br />\nFor reference, first, the No. 11 bus<br />\niruns down Charles Street (next to the<br />\nDorms) into the heart of the city.

From<br />\nits crystal-set origins in the early<br />\ntwenties, AM radio has expanded through<br />\nyears of technical and artistic<br />\nexperimentation to produce a crystal-set<br />\nmedia. AM radio still snaps, crackles and<br />\npops in time with the light ing of your<br />\nneighbor's fluorescent lights, and spews<br />\nforth some of the dryest music and has<br />\nbecome a veritable cultural desert.<br />\nOne ingredient necessary in<br />\nformulating the local radio goulash is<br />\nBaltimore itself. The temperature is 56<br />\ndegrees, the humidity is 95%, but it isn't<br />\nraining, the sky is gray or pollution alert<br />\norange, you have a cold you can't seem<br />\nto shake, and they've just ticketed your<br />\ncar for a parking violation you did not<br />\ncommit. But do not despair: there is<br />\nrefuge in that electronic wasteland.<br />\nWhat follows is what's happening with<br />\nthe five big buttons on your radio:<br />\nButton One: This is the button that<br />\nyou can punch the easiest. Stretch your<br />\narm to full-length and measure your<br />\nstriking range. My pick for this button<br />\nhere in theCity: WWIN 1400 kc.<br />\nThis is the Top 40 soul mainstay of<br />\nBaltimore. Up this year from button<br />\nnumber two position, WWIN is great<br />\nmusic for car cruising. Soul Music has<br />\nrefined and progressed since the sixties,<br />\nbut the backbone rhythms are just<br />\nundeniable. True, if you're not used to<br />\nsoul it may grate on you at first, as<br />\nrepetitive and inane; but let it flow and<br />\nit's the best. One thing that takes a little<br />\nlonger to get used to is the DJ's, who are<br />\nprobably the most unprofessional in<br />\ntown. In true soul station fashion they<br />\ninterrupt the songs to add little<br />\ncomments and exclamationsobut their<br />\ntaste in selection pulls them through. It's<br />\nreally no worse than most stations where<br />\nthey talk a tune up to the first word and<br />\nstep right back in after the last.<br />\nCommercials are fascinating in all<br />\nrespects, especially if you're not used to<br />\nthem, the amount of hype for Brown's<br />\nsupermarket is incredible!<br />\nButton Two: Down from Button One,<br />\n<br />\nand slipping rapidly, WAYE 860 is one of<br />\nthe best AM stations of its kind in the<br />\nNortheast. Then why number two?<br />\nDuring the past two years WAYE has<br />\nwaned along with the general quality of<br />\nrock music. The format is notreally<br />\nprogressive, but it is certainly not top 40.<br />\nAnnouncing is slick, but not \"wowed.\"<br />\nDirected at the youth market, the<br />\nattitude is relevant to young Baltimore:<br />\nit'll kill you. It has me, but it still rates<br />\nA-1 for the amount of \"honky\" rock it<br />\nplays.<br />\nButton Three: After one and two<br />\nquality drops out of the picture as you<br />\nenter the world of hard core top 40.<br />\nCommercials abound, the Dfs must wear<br />\npaisley suits and throw out their gold<br />\nteeth, and the programming is infiltrated<br />\nwith Olivia Newton John, Bad Company<br />\nand the Osmonds. Go with WCAO, the<br />\nannouncers are the best of the worst, and<br />\ntheir gold record selection is the best in<br />\ntown. Played without a \"let's go back to<br />\nthe goldmine\" jingle, the greats of the<br />\npast kind of sneak up on you, before you<br />\nknow they're there. Score one for a good<br />\nstrong signal which counts at night, since<br />\nWAYE goes off the air at sundown.<br />\nButton Four: WFBR, \"mad radio\"<br />\n1300. Great billboards, crazy announcers,<br />\njunky music, occasionally, this makes for<br />\nan interesting try when you've come up<br />\ndry on the first three. Also, they have<br />\nexcellent helicopter traffic reports. In<br />\nmost cities this wouldn't even be<br />\nconsidered for your precious ears's<br />\nhearing; here in Baltimore it didn't even<br />\nfall to number five.<br />\nButton Five: This is the one you hit in<br />\ncase of national disaster, acts of God, or<br />\nby mistake. I'm afraid I've got to go with<br />\nWBAL. 1080 on the dial, it switches<br />\nplaces in the cosmos with WTIC in<br />\nHartford at night.

Students depart from the<br />\nstore with all their required books,<br />\nleaving close to one hundred dollars with<br />\nthe cashier.<br />\nTo the incoming freshmen, the<br />\nbookcenter is probably fine. However,<br />\nwhile it is convenient and has all the<br />\nrequired books in one location, it is also<br />\noverpriced. Although the management of<br />\nthe bookcenter shares the blame for this<br />\nproblem, the seeming indifference of the<br />\nHopkins faculty contributes largely to<br />\noverpriced books.<br />\nWhen professors order the books they<br />\nneed for a course, little thought is given<br />\nto the student who must keep a tight<br />\nbudget. Professors invariably order an<br />\nexpensive edition of a book when the<br />\nsame text could be had for half the price.<br />\nThis is especially true in the Humanities<br />\nand Social and Behavioral Science<br />\ncourses.<br />\nFor example, last semester \"The<br />\nMonk\" was used in two advanced English<br />\nclasses. One of these courses featured a<br />\nhandsome paperback editionwhich cost<br />\nclose to three dollars. In the other, a<br />\ntwelve-dollar hard-back edition was<br />\nrequired. Such disparity is not<br />\nuncommon as often three different<br />\neditions of the same book, with varying<br />\nprices, will be found in the bookcenter<br />\nracks.<br />\nFortunately, there are alternatives to<br />\nthe Bookcenter. Allen's Bookshop at<br />\nThirty-third Street and the Book Fair at<br />\n3121 St. Paul Street offer numerous<br />\nrequired texts at reasonable prices.<br />\nAllen's Bookshop, which deals<br />\nexclusively in used books, opened last<br />\n<br />\nSeptember and has been building and<br />\nimproving its stock consistently. Most<br />\npaperbacks are thirty-five cents while<br />\nmore deluxe editions such as Scribners,<br />\nRinehart, Riverside and Penguins are fifty<br />\ncents. Most hard-backs are less than two<br />\ndollars.<br />\nStudents who are in survey courses can<br />\noften find half their required books at<br />\nAllen's for the price of one or two<br />\neditions at the Bookcenter. Allen's is also<br />\none of the friendliest spots in the Charles<br />\nVillage-Waverly neighborhood, managed<br />\nby a man who believes that books should<br />\nalways be inexpensive.<br />\nThose who prefer new but<br />\nreasonably-priced paperbacks are advised<br />\nto shop at the St. Paul Book Fair.<br />\nOffering a complete stock of both classic<br />\nand contemporary works, the store<br />\nfeature bargains on a wide selectiohof<br />\nbooks. Almost all books in the Modern<br />\nLibrary series (which include many<br />\nrequired in survey courses) are reduced to<br />\nat least half price with greater savings<br />\navailable if more than one book is<br />\nbought.<br />\nAlso, the Book Fair sells editions with<br />\nlist prices which are years old and<br />\nconsequently less expensive. For<br />\nexample, some novels by Dickens can still<br />\nbe bought for less than a dollar.<br />\nAnother means of obtaining books is<br />\nby checking bulletin boards throughout<br />\nthe campus. Usually, students sell books<br />\nthat they used in past courses for<br />\nhalf-price.<br />\nWith these alternatives available, all<br />\nwithin walking distance, there is no need<br />\nto rush to the Bookcenter. Obviously<br />\nsome books will be found in that location<br />\nalone, but with patience the thrifty<br />\nstudent can save money and be spared<br />\nthe inevitable chaos at the Bookcenter.<br />\n<br />\nNow, for only $10.00. you parents can also receive a personalized<br />\n*copy of the News-Letter (50 issues) right in your very home.

In 1844,<br />\nBaltimore\u2014already known as<br />\n\"Mobtown\"\u2014hosted the first and only<br />\nnational convention of the Anti-Masonic<br />\nParty, which nominated William Wirt for<br />\nthe Presidency.!<br />\nIn the late 1840's and early 1850's the<br />\nnativistic Know-Nothing party dominated<br />\nlocal politics. One of the party's favorite<br />\ncampaign techniques was to round up<br />\nunfriendly voters and lock them up in<br />\nbasements (\"coops\") until after the polls<br />\nclosed, thus preventing the opposition<br />\nfrom voting. One of the victims of this<br />\npractice, known as \"cooping\", was Edgar<br />\nAllen Poe, who lived in Baltimore when<br />\nhe couldn't sell his poems and stories,<br />\nAccording to another version of the<br />\nlegend, the Know -Nothings rather<br />\n<br />\n(appropriate) got Poe drunk and marched<br />\nhim around to many different polling<br />\nplaces, forcing him to vote for their<br />\ncandidate. In any case, it is certain that<br />\nPoe died in Baltimore on Election Day in<br />\n1849\u2014probably exhausted by some<br />\ncampaign ordeal.<br />\nAfter 1848, Baltimore received some<br />\nGerman immigrants and the quality of<br />\nthe local beer improved somewhat,<br />\nenhancing the city's desirability as a<br />\nconvention site. In 1856, the<br />\nKnow-Nothings nominated ex-President<br />\nMillard Fillmore here. He carried only the<br />\nstate of Maryland in the general<br />\nelection\u2014on the basis of the large<br />\nBaltimore turnout.

All agreed that the<br />\nupperclassmen were friendly and<br />\nhelped them in whatever area they<br />\ncould. The Committee drew<br />\ncompliments such as \"they did one<br />\nhelluva job\" and \"those people were<br />\nin such great spirits, I couldn't<br />\nfigure out where their incentive<br />\nwas.\". Initial impressions of the<br />\ndorms were mostly indifferent,<br />\nalthough some complained about<br />\nthe drab cinder block walls and<br />\nlimited space in their rooms.<br />\nWhen asked why they chose to<br />\nstudy at Hopkins, freshmen gave<br />\nanswers that ranged from \"It has a<br />\ngood reputation in the sciences and<br />\nI was told that I'd be able to do<br />\nresearch without hassles from my<br />\ndepartment\" to \"I didn't get into<br />\nHarvard or Yale so I came here.\"<br />\nMost students seemed to have little<br />\nidea how difficult their courses will<br />\nbe, although all expect long study<br />\nhours and competitive classes.

The moment I entered the<br />\ncramped airplane and glanced at the<br />\nvarious faces eyeing me from their seats, I<br />\nknew I was on my way to Baltimore. An<br />\noverwhelming feeling of pure RAUNCH<br />\ne nveloped me. I don't say this as an<br />\ninsult. Some of my best friends are<br />\nraunch y, Baltimore is one of the great<br />\nRAUNCH centers of the world. Don't let<br />\nthis scare you. It is a merely a front for<br />\neven raunchier, and more exciting, things.<br />\nThis was my first time in Baltimore<br />\nbefore school opened (I don't think<br />\nnineteen years ago when I was born at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital counts) and<br />\nthe very next night some mates and I<br />\ndecided to walk around and enjoy the<br />\nHopkins campus on a cool summer night<br />\nafter a rain. Our rationale was complete<br />\nand insane: we were card-carryingmembers of the club, (fingering our<br />\nHopkins identification). So what if the<br />\nclub didn't open until September 1st?<br />\nThere is a great deal to be said for the<br />\nCampus almost completely devoid of<br />\nPeople.<br />\nHopkins is a very beautiful place. You<br />\nstep off the streets of Baltimore,<br />\nPicturesquely decorated with slums and<br />\nthe old, and you may enjoy the quiet of a<br />\nsmall forest, the solemnity, or maybe<br />\nagony, of academia reflected by buildings<br />\nOld and new, or the strange ultra-modern<br />\ndecadence of the Student Union. The<br />\nGlass Pavilion, oddly enough, is most<br />\nImpressive when it is completely empty.<br />\n\"But what does it matter?\"<br />\nWhen I came to the Hop last year, I<br />\nconstantly found myself in conflict with<br />\nsomeone or something. My roommate<br />\nand I discovered we made the Odd<br />\nCouple Jo ok very compatible. The<br />\ntensions rose until one night we both<br />\nexploded, and if not for the reasonability<br />\nof a roommate three times my size, I<br />\ntbight not be here writing this article. We<br /><br />\neach wanted the other to leave, but the<br />\nidea of ourselves moving was out of the<br />\nquestion. Both of us knew there was no<br />\nbetter place to go. What developed was<br />\nan intense respect for each other and a<br />\nvery close friendship.<br />\nMy relationship with the University<br />\ngrew in much the same way. After<br />\nbecoming fed up with a non-existent<br />\nCommunication department, a radio<br />\nstation which almost everyone refused to<br />\ntake seriously, and a social life, or lack<br />\nthereof, which was driving me crackers, I<br />\nbecame determined to transfer.<br />\nSticking my nose into the directories<br />\nof other universities, I noticed what. I<br />\nwould lose by leaving the Hop. It would<br />\nbe difficult to find a comparable<br />\nacademic institution as small as Hopkins.<br />\nIt would be unlikely to find a place with<br />\nsuch easy accessibility to professors,<br />\nespecially the famous ones. And it would<br />\nbe impossible to find a school which<br />\nencourages so much freedom. I am<br />\nconvinced you can do anything you want<br />\nhere as long as you can find a faculty<br />\nmember to approve it, and sometmes<br />\neven that is unneccesary.<br />\nSo I stayed. I'm happy I did. The club<br />\nis home to me. But enough with this P.R.<br />\ngame. I don't have to sell you on the<br />\nHop. After all, you're stuck here for at<br />\nleast one semester, probably two.<br />\nMost of you will be living in the<br />\nAlumni Memorial Residences, or as they<br />\nare affectionately known: \"the dorms.\" I<br />\nstill do not understand why this housing<br />\ndevelopment receives such abuse from<br />\nmost of the Hopkins community, that is<br />\nthe student community. Most of the<br /><br />\nrooms in the dormitories have an<br />\nunbelievable amount of storage space.<br />\nWith a bit of thought, your cubicle can<br />\nbe turned into a very comfortable place<br />\nto live. And, last winter, the dorms were<br />\nlike living in a sauna bath. But the best<br />\nthing of all is the total freedom. Even<br />\noutside in the \"real world\" you probably<br />\nwill not have the complete liberty to be<br />\nwho you want to be and do what you<br />\nwant to do, short of murder and<br />\naggravated rape. The University says you<br />\nare young adults quite capable of running<br />\nyour own lives, and gives you the<br />\nenvironment to do it in.<br />\nLast year I truly felt that my class did<br />\nnot take full advantage of the situation.<br />\nMost of them seemed completely<br />\nobsessed with the paranoia that they<br />\nwould not make it academically. This<br />\nmore than likely detracted from doing<br />\nwell in the classroom. In the end, it was<br />\nlike something only Ionesco could have<br />\nwritten.

David<br />\nJones, a Welsh hermit, settled beside<br />\nJones Falls (a sewer flowing into the<br />\nPatapsco, now covered by an expressway)<br />\nin 1664, after he was exiled from<br />\nAnnapolis for \"having no visible means of<br />\nsupport.\" Jones learned from 'friendly<br />\nIndians how to brew beer, which he<br />\nsmuggled into Annapolis occasionally out<br />\nof a desire for revenge. This brew, which<br />\nhas been marketed under a variety of<br />\nnames, the most recent trademark being<br />\n\"National Bohemian\", is everything a<br />\ngreat beer should be without being a<br />\ngreat beer.<br />\nThe proprietors of the Maryland<br />\ncolony saw the potential for a great port<br />\ncity at the site of the hamlet of<br />\nJonestown (several other members of the<br />\nAnnapolis lumpenproletariat had joined<br />\nDavid Jones' operation and had formed a<br />\nsmall community of depravity). In 1729<br />\nthe town of Baltimore was laid out\u2014in a<br />\nskirmish with the town of Poit Deposit.<br /><br />\nBy the time of the American<br />\nRevolution, Baltimore had a population of<br />\nabout 7,000, most of whom were<br />\nengaged in shipbuilding, brewing, milling,<br />\nor smuggling. The smuggling honchos<br />\nbecame the town's aristocracy. In spite of<br />\nBritish navigation laws, Baltimore<br />\nclippers (the merchants were so called<br />\nbecause of the high prices they charged,<br />\nnot due to their habit of playing hockey<br />\non the decks of their ships), traded with<br />\nthe West Indies, exchanging their inferior<br />\nflour and beer for slaves and rum.<br />\nBaltimoreans have always been sharp<br />\ntraders. For example, Frank Cashen<br />\nrecently swapped an ailing Dave McNally<br />\nfor Montreal's Ken Singleton and Mike<br />\nTorrez. This should have been enough,<br />\nincidentally, to guarantee a pennant for<br />\nthe Baltimore Orioles. Unfortunatley, the<br />\nteam neglected to pay off a few umpires<br />\nso they're still behind Boston.<br />\nThe Farce as History<br />\nBut back to the Revolution! A rebel<br />\nregiment called the Maryland Line;<br />\ncoached by Jerry Claiborne, was<br />\norganized. At the Battle of Long Island,<br />\nGeroge Washington deployed the<br />\nMaryland Line (composed mainly of<br />\nBaltimoreans) to hold off the British<br />\nwhile he executed a quarterback sneak<br />\nacross me tast Kiver to safety. George<br />\ngot away, but the Maryland Line was<br />\nalmost wiped out to a man. Ever since,<br />\nBaltimoreans have. nourished a mutinous<br />\nspirit and a distrust for \"big<br />\ngovernment\", even if that government is<br />\na rebel government with an army led by a<br />\nneighbor. They also try to stay out of<br />\nLong Island as much as possible.<br />\nIn gratitude to General Washington,<br />\nthe widows of Baltimore paid for a<br />\nmonument honoring the Virginian to be<br />\nconstructed. Fifty years later, it was<br />\nfinally finished.. Roads, schools, rapid<br />\ntransit systems, and monuments have<br />\nalways taken a long time to get under<br /><br />\nway in Baltimore. By the time they are<br />\ncompleted, they are usually obsolete.<br />\nSuch was the case with Baltimore's<br />\nWashington Monument. A short time<br />\nafter it was topped off, Washington, D.C.<br />\nstarted work on its own monument,<br />\nwhich eclipsed the Baltimore version.<br />\nThe Dawn's Early Light<br />\nDuring the War of 1812, the British<br />\nburned Washington, D.C. Just for the hell<br />\nof it, they decided to sail up the<br />\nChesapeake and take care of Baltimore. A<br />\nnearsighted local lawyer named Francis<br />\nScott Key saw a good opportunity to<br />\nmake some profit. With a few friends, he<br />\nrowed out to the British flagship and<br />\ntried to sell the enemy some of the local<br />\nbrew. When the British tasted it, they<br />\nthrew Key and his wares into the brig. At<br />\nthe dawn of September 12, 1814, the<br />\ninebriated F. Scott looked out of his<br />\nporthole, saw the Union Jack flying from<br />\nthe mast of another ship in the British<br />\nsquadron, mistotok it for the American<br />\nflag, and wrote the \"Star-Spangled<br />\nBanner\". /After a British landing party<br />\ntook sick from eating some tainted<br />\ncrabmeat, the foe'si\"haughty host\" lost<br />\ninterest in the battle and sailed away.<br />\nThus, Baltimore escaped destruction<br />\nand was left with a future national<br />\nanthem and a reputation for producing<br />\npurple prose.

The<br />\nmen who operate the stand are snappish<br />\nand there is definitely nr browsing but<br />\ntraded for the constant availability of<br />\nnews, it's a fair deal.<br />\nThe first edition of the Morning Sun<br />\ncan be bought at eleven p.m. every night.<br />\nOne of the more familiar<br />\nestablishments in the neighborhood is<br />\nJohn Gach's Bookstore, 3322<br />\nGreenmount Ave. Dealing mainly in used<br />\nbooks, Gach's is well stocked and varied,<br />\nif rather expensive. Some paperbacks are<br />\nstill twenty-five cents. Although we<br />\nprefer Allen's Bookshop, John Gach's is<br />\nstill a sensible alternative to the JHU<br />\nBookcenter. Managed by courteous and<br />\nhelpful people, the store also serves as a<br />\nkind of community center and is a<br />\nworthwhile place to spend time.<br />\nThe Open House\u2014located on<br />\nRemington and 29th Street, the Open<br />\nHouse, or OH, is perhaps the original<br />\ngreasy spoon. OH's unsafe location and<br />\nsordid clientele have earned it the<br /><br />\nnickname \"Open Wound.\" OH is one of<br />\nthe few all-night establishments in all of<br />\nBaltimore and the only one within<br />\nwalking distance of the Homewood<br />\ncampus. Most of the food is greasy,<br />\nespecially the french fries, but the<br />\nbreakfast combinations are good. Don't<br />\nwalk to OH alone after dark and don't<br />\nworry: that man next to you at the<br />\ncounter is not dead. He is asleep.<br />\nMee-Jun-Low--At 219 W. Mulberry,<br />\nthis Chinese restaurant is one of the few<br />\nrestaurants that is truly cheap and at the<br />\nsame time good.

Once a<br />\nstudent has decided he wants to get out<br />\nand see the city, to visit the museums, to<br />\nattend concerts and shows in the area, he<br />\nshouldn't let transportation or the lack of<br />\nit deter him.<br />\nFive Bus routes border the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. The Metropolitan Bus Service in<br />\nBaltimore, while not the best way to<br />\ntravel, can take the eager wanderer<br />\nfarther than one might expect at a small<br />\ncost (30 cents). Buses in Baltimore are<br />\nfairly reliable in that they stick to their<br />\nschedules. However, the frequency with<br />\nwhich they run (rush-hour excepted) can<br />\noften frustrate the most patient<br />\nexcursionist. Anyone interested in using<br />\nthe buses can call the Metropolitan<br />\nTransit Authority (MTA) to find out<br />\nroutes and schedules for buses and thus<br />\navoid unnecessary delays at the Bus stop.<br />\nAs a rule of thumb, a wait of 15-20<br />\nminutes for a bus during rush hour<br />\nshould be anticipated, twice that amount<br />\nat other times. The waits won't always be<br />\nthat long, depending on the line used, but<br />\ninorder to be sure you'll get where you're<br />\ngoing on time, ample waiting time should<br />\nbe allowed.<br />\nFor those who just want to wander<br />\nvaried<br />\nabout the city and see the<br />\nsights, the city sponsors its \"Super<br />\nSundays.\" For 50 cents, you can ride the<br />\nbuses (all lines) in any direction all day<br />\nSunday. It's a stealoconsidering that the<br />\nregular fare is 30 cents, plus 5 cents for a<br />\ntransfer, 5 cents.- for a zone change for<br />\njust one ride.<br />\nBelow are listed selected places of<br />\ninterest and necessity, with the different<br />\nways to get there.<br />\nFor reference, first, the No. 11 bus<br />\niruns down Charles Street (next to the<br />\nDorms) into the heart of the city.

From<br />\nits crystal-set origins in the early<br />\ntwenties, AM radio has expanded through<br />\nyears of technical and artistic<br />\nexperimentation to produce a crystal-set<br />\nmedia. AM radio still snaps, crackles and<br />\npops in time with the light ing of your<br />\nneighbor's fluorescent lights, and spews<br />\nforth some of the dryest music and has<br />\nbecome a veritable cultural desert.<br />\nOne ingredient necessary in<br />\nformulating the local radio goulash is<br />\nBaltimore itself. The temperature is 56<br />\ndegrees, the humidity is 95%, but it isn't<br />\nraining, the sky is gray or pollution alert<br />\norange, you have a cold you can't seem<br />\nto shake, and they've just ticketed your<br />\ncar for a parking violation you did not<br />\ncommit. But do not despair: there is<br />\nrefuge in that electronic wasteland.<br />\nWhat follows is what's happening with<br />\nthe five big buttons on your radio:<br />\nButton One: This is the button that<br />\nyou can punch the easiest. Stretch your<br />\narm to full-length and measure your<br />\nstriking range. My pick for this button<br />\nhere in theCity: WWIN 1400 kc.<br />\nThis is the Top 40 soul mainstay of<br />\nBaltimore. Up this year from button<br />\nnumber two position, WWIN is great<br />\nmusic for car cruising. Soul Music has<br />\nrefined and progressed since the sixties,<br />\nbut the backbone rhythms are just<br />\nundeniable. True, if you're not used to<br />\nsoul it may grate on you at first, as<br />\nrepetitive and inane; but let it flow and<br />\nit's the best. One thing that takes a little<br />\nlonger to get used to is the DJ's, who are<br />\nprobably the most unprofessional in<br />\ntown. In true soul station fashion they<br />\ninterrupt the songs to add little<br />\ncomments and exclamationsobut their<br />\ntaste in selection pulls them through. It's<br />\nreally no worse than most stations where<br />\nthey talk a tune up to the first word and<br />\nstep right back in after the last.<br />\nCommercials are fascinating in all<br />\nrespects, especially if you're not used to<br />\nthem, the amount of hype for Brown's<br />\nsupermarket is incredible!<br />\nButton Two: Down from Button One,<br /><br />\nand slipping rapidly, WAYE 860 is one of<br />\nthe best AM stations of its kind in the<br />\nNortheast. Then why number two?<br />\nDuring the past two years WAYE has<br />\nwaned along with the general quality of<br />\nrock music. The format is notreally<br />\nprogressive, but it is certainly not top 40.<br />\nAnnouncing is slick, but not \"wowed.\"<br />\nDirected at the youth market, the<br />\nattitude is relevant to young Baltimore:<br />\nit'll kill you. It has me, but it still rates<br />\nA-1 for the amount of \"honky\" rock it<br />\nplays.<br />\nButton Three: After one and two<br />\nquality drops out of the picture as you<br />\nenter the world of hard core top 40.<br />\nCommercials abound, the Dfs must wear<br />\npaisley suits and throw out their gold<br />\nteeth, and the programming is infiltrated<br />\nwith Olivia Newton John, Bad Company<br />\nand the Osmonds. Go with WCAO, the<br />\nannouncers are the best of the worst, and<br />\ntheir gold record selection is the best in<br />\ntown. Played without a \"let's go back to<br />\nthe goldmine\" jingle, the greats of the<br />\npast kind of sneak up on you, before you<br />\nknow they're there. Score one for a good<br />\nstrong signal which counts at night, since<br />\nWAYE goes off the air at sundown.<br />\nButton Four: WFBR, \"mad radio\"<br />\n1300. Great billboards, crazy announcers,<br />\njunky music, occasionally, this makes for<br />\nan interesting try when you've come up<br />\ndry on the first three. Also, they have<br />\nexcellent helicopter traffic reports. In<br />\nmost cities this wouldn't even be<br />\nconsidered for your precious ears's<br />\nhearing; here in Baltimore it didn't even<br />\nfall to number five.<br />\nButton Five: This is the one you hit in<br />\ncase of national disaster, acts of God, or<br />\nby mistake. I'm afraid I've got to go with<br />\nWBAL. 1080 on the dial, it switches<br />\nplaces in the cosmos with WTIC in<br />\nHartford at night.

Occasionally playing Top 40 soul<br />\nnumbers, HUR can be the best sounds for<br />\nserious listening. Broadcasting from<br />\nHoward University in Washington, the<br />\nsignal is a bit difficult to receive ,<br />\nespecially in stereo. But you are left with<br />\nno viable alternative.

Students depart from the<br />\nstore with all their required books,<br />\nleaving close to one hundred dollars with<br />\nthe cashier.<br />\nTo the incoming freshmen, the<br />\nbookcenter is probably fine. However,<br />\nwhile it is convenient and has all the<br />\nrequired books in one location, it is also<br />\noverpriced. Although the management of<br />\nthe bookcenter shares the blame for this<br />\nproblem, the seeming indifference of the<br />\nHopkins faculty contributes largely to<br />\noverpriced books.<br />\nWhen professors order the books they<br />\nneed for a course, little thought is given<br />\nto the student who must keep a tight<br />\nbudget. Professors invariably order an<br />\nexpensive edition of a book when the<br />\nsame text could be had for half the price.<br />\nThis is especially true in the Humanities<br />\nand Social and Behavioral Science<br />\ncourses.<br />\nFor example, last semester \"The<br />\nMonk\" was used in two advanced English<br />\nclasses. One of these courses featured a<br />\nhandsome paperback editionwhich cost<br />\nclose to three dollars. In the other, a<br />\ntwelve-dollar hard-back edition was<br />\nrequired. Such disparity is not<br />\nuncommon as often three different<br />\neditions of the same book, with varying<br />\nprices, will be found in the bookcenter<br />\nracks.<br />\nFortunately, there are alternatives to<br />\nthe Bookcenter. Allen's Bookshop at<br />\nThirty-third Street and the Book Fair at<br />\n3121 St. Paul Street offer numerous<br />\nrequired texts at reasonable prices.<br />\nAllen's Bookshop, which deals<br />\nexclusively in used books, opened last<br /><br />\nSeptember and has been building and<br />\nimproving its stock consistently. Most<br />\npaperbacks are thirty-five cents while<br />\nmore deluxe editions such as Scribners,<br />\nRinehart, Riverside and Penguins are fifty<br />\ncents. Most hard-backs are less than two<br />\ndollars.<br />\nStudents who are in survey courses can<br />\noften find half their required books at<br />\nAllen's for the price of one or two<br />\neditions at the Bookcenter. Allen's is also<br />\none of the friendliest spots in the Charles<br />\nVillage-Waverly neighborhood, managed<br />\nby a man who believes that books should<br />\nalways be inexpensive.<br />\nThose who prefer new but<br />\nreasonably-priced paperbacks are advised<br />\nto shop at the St. Paul Book Fair.<br />\nOffering a complete stock of both classic<br />\nand contemporary works, the store<br />\nfeature bargains on a wide selectiohof<br />\nbooks. Almost all books in the Modern<br />\nLibrary series (which include many<br />\nrequired in survey courses) are reduced to<br />\nat least half price with greater savings<br />\navailable if more than one book is<br />\nbought.<br />\nAlso, the Book Fair sells editions with<br />\nlist prices which are years old and<br />\nconsequently less expensive. For<br />\nexample, some novels by Dickens can still<br />\nbe bought for less than a dollar.<br />\nAnother means of obtaining books is<br />\nby checking bulletin boards throughout<br />\nthe campus. Usually, students sell books<br />\nthat they used in past courses for<br />\nhalf-price.<br />\nWith these alternatives available, all<br />\nwithin walking distance, there is no need<br />\nto rush to the Bookcenter. Obviously<br />\nsome books will be found in that location<br />\nalone, but with patience the thrifty<br />\nstudent can save money and be spared<br />\nthe inevitable chaos at the Bookcenter.<br /><br />\nNow, for only $10.00. you parents can also receive a personalized<br />\n*copy of the News-Letter (50 issues) right in your very home.

An example of the<br />\nformer type, the Beaux Arts enjoy a<br />\ndecade's praise as one of the premier<br />\npiano trios in the world; only<br />\nStern-Istomin-Rose and one or two other<br />\ngroups command equal billing.

In 1844,<br />\nBaltimore\u2014already known as<br />\n\"Mobtown\"\u2014hosted the first and only<br />\nnational convention of the Anti-Masonic<br />\nParty, which nominated William Wirt for<br />\nthe Presidency.!<br />\nIn the late 1840's and early 1850's the<br />\nnativistic Know-Nothing party dominated<br />\nlocal politics. One of the party's favorite<br />\ncampaign techniques was to round up<br />\nunfriendly voters and lock them up in<br />\nbasements (\"coops\") until after the polls<br />\nclosed, thus preventing the opposition<br />\nfrom voting. One of the victims of this<br />\npractice, known as \"cooping\", was Edgar<br />\nAllen Poe, who lived in Baltimore when<br />\nhe couldn't sell his poems and stories,<br />\nAccording to another version of the<br />\nlegend, the Know -Nothings rather<br /><br />\n(appropriate) got Poe drunk and marched<br />\nhim around to many different polling<br />\nplaces, forcing him to vote for their<br />\ncandidate. In any case, it is certain that<br />\nPoe died in Baltimore on Election Day in<br />\n1849\u2014probably exhausted by some<br />\ncampaign ordeal.<br />\nAfter 1848, Baltimore received some<br />\nGerman immigrants and the quality of<br />\nthe local beer improved somewhat,<br />\nenhancing the city's desirability as a<br />\nconvention site. In 1856, the<br />\nKnow-Nothings nominated ex-President<br />\nMillard Fillmore here. He carried only the<br />\nstate of Maryland in the general<br />\nelection\u2014on the basis of the large<br />\nBaltimore turnout. A political proverb<br />\nwas born: as Baltimore goes, so goes<br />\nMaryland. As Maryland goes...so goes<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nTo be continued Friday.<br /><br />\nFreshmen arrive but weather reigns<br />\nApproximately half of the<br />\nexpected 570 freshmen moved into<br />\nthe Alumni Memorial Residences<br />\nyesterday, braving unseasonably<br />\ncool temperatures and occasional<br />\nheavy rains throughout the day. The<br />\nremainder of the class of '79 will<br />\narrive at the dorms today, marking<br />\nthe completion of the first phase of<br />\nOrientation '75.<br />\nFreshmen interviewed yesterday<br />\nwere unanimous in their praise of<br />\nthe Orientation Committee's<br />\nefficiency in moving them into the<br />\ndorms. All agreed that the<br />\nupperclassmen were friendly and<br />\nhelped them in whatever area they<br />\ncould. The Committee drew<br />\ncompliments such as \"they did one<br />\nhelluva job\" and \"those people were<br />\nin such great spirits, I couldn't<br />\nfigure out where their incentive<br />\nwas.\". Initial impressions of the<br />\ndorms were mostly indifferent,<br />\nalthough some complained about<br />\nthe drab cinder block walls and<br />\nlimited space in their rooms.<br />\nWhen asked why they chose to<br />\nstudy at Hopkins, freshmen gave<br />\nanswers that ranged from \"It has a<br />\ngood reputation in the sciences and<br />\nI was told that I'd be able to do<br />\nresearch without hassles from my<br />\ndepartment\" to \"I didn't get into<br />\nHarvard or Yale so I came here.\"<br />\nMost students seemed to have little<br />\nidea how difficult their courses will<br />\nbe, although all expect long study<br />\nhours and competitive classes. Eddie<br />\nChaum, a pre-med from Los<br />\nAngeles, said that he was slightly<br />\nnervous about the upcoming school<br />\nyear, as both his parents and<br />\ngrandparents are waiting for news of<br />\nhis success in the mail.<br />\nMichael Krochak, a biology major<br />\nfrom Long Island, said that he plans<br />\nto \"get the most out of<br />\nOrientation\" in anticipation of hard<br />\nstudyzng ahead.<br />\nAlthough favorably impressed<br />\nwith :Le Homewood campus, some<br />\nfreshmen were not so kind in their<br />\nappraisals of Baltimore. Citing filthy<br />\nstreets, a dislike of cities and a \"lack<br />\nof night life,\" the students<br />\nconveyed common, if confused,<br />\nopinions of the city that will be<br />\ntheir home for the next four years.<br />\nCarol Hahn, a psychology major<br />\nfrom Long Island, said that she<br /><br />\nthinks Hopkins has a \"nice city<br />\ncampus,\" she wishes Baltimore was<br />\nmore of a college town. She added<br />\nthat although Baltimore has a<br />\nnumber of colleges and universities<br />\nin the area, \"it just isn't the same as<br />\nBoston, Philadelphia, and<br />\nWashington.\"<br />\nFrank Fedele, a biology major<br />\nfrom Brooklyn, New York, was<br />\nmore optimistic about the city,<br />\nsaying \"it's my kind of place, I can't<br />\nwait to check it out.\" To combat<br />\npreconceived impressions of<br />\nBaltimore, the Orientation<br />\nCommittee has organized several<br />\nexcursions into the Greater<br />\nHomewood area. The tours, which<br />\nare intended to familiarize students<br />\nwith the surrounding community,<br /><br />\nFreshmen who had not seen<br />\nHopkins before their arrival<br />\nyesterday were pleasantly surprised<br />\nas most of them had expected an<br />\nurban campus similar to those at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania or<br />\nColumbia University. One student'<br />\nsaid that the Homewood Campus<br />\nprovided a comfortable country<br />\natmosphere while being \"only a<br />\nstone's throw from real city life.\"<br />\nA. majority of freshmen<br />\ninterviewed expressed a desire to<br />\nparticipate in on and off campus<br />\nactivities, although only a few<br />\nplanned to get involved<br />\nimmediately.<br />\nThe group's general consensus on<br />\nextra-curricular activities was<br />\nexpressed by a student who said,<br /><br />\nThey went that way!<br />\n\"I'm waiting to see what is expected<br />\nwill be held throughout the week-.<br />\nof me academically.
