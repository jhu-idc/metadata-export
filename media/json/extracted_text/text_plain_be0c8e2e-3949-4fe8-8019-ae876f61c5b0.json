This action will coincide with similar<br />\nrallies, sponsored by the Student Mobilization<br />\nCommittee, to be held around the country. The<br />\ndemonstration will begin at 1:30 p.m., in front<br />\nof the Customs House, where the offices of the<br />\nBaltimore draft board are located.<br />\nBy ANDY GREEN<br />\n' Disruption of draft board activities and a possible sit-in are planned for Thursday by the Hopkins Peace Action Committee.<br />\nThe PAC plans a legal disruption of the draft<br />\nboard at the Customs House in downtown<br />\nBaltimore as part of nationwide activities during<br />\nAnti-Draft Week. If legal action fails, however,<br />\ndemonstrators will sit-in at the draft board. The<br />\nactions inside the Customs House will be supported by a large demonstration outside sponsored by various anti-war groups.<br />\nThe legal disruption will take the form of<br />\nengaging draft board secretaries in conversations<br />\nabout draft matters to prevent them from carry-<br />\n<br />\ning out their normal duties. People registered<br />\nwith this draft board will also bring in material<br />\nto add to their files and discuss the additions<br />\nwith draft board personnel.<br />\nAlthough these actions are legal, PAC leaders<br />\nbelieve that the draft board will try to have the<br />\ndemonstrators thrown out for disturbing the<br />\npeace. If such moves are made, the demonstrators will carry out a non-violent sit-in. They<br />\nwill remain there until arrested by police.<br />\nIf the sit-in participants are arrested, they<br />\nmight be charged with trespassing, obstructing<br />\nthe functioning of the Selective Service System<br />\nand conspiracy.

The<br />\nFEATURE<br />\nmass media harangues on the shortage of jobs for holders of the doctorate.<br />\nNewsweek investigates \"The Doctoral Glut\". The<br />\nNew York Times proclaims \"Ph.D. Alternative Debated\". (It's only a matter of time before the Daily News<br />\nsniffs the hot story--page one--\"Bronx Housewife<br />\nScreams: 'IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?'-No Reply!\")<br />\nThe problem is a classic supply and demand case-too many doctors and not enough openings. The Associate Dean for Administration, Robert Strider told of a Big<br />\nTen school that had four vacancys in its English Department and received five hundred applications.<br />\nThe oversupply is not limited to humanities fields<br />\nalone --Newsweek reports a recent survey that indicated<br />\nthat there were twenty times as many candidates as jobs<br />\nIn physics. In an article in the latest Johns Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nDean Robert Strider: \"If your base is a group of colleges that<br />\nare designated as 'good,' there has been a definite tightening of<br />\nthe market.\"<br />\n<br />\nMagazine, Professors Owen .Phillips and George Owen<br />\nquote a study which estimates \"that although 13,200<br />\nnew Ph.D.'s will be available for college teaching in<br />\nJune, 1970, only 7,700 will be needed to maintain faculty<br />\nquality.\"<br />\nAt least part of the problem seems to be the students'<br />\nchoosiness as to where he wants to teach. \"There is no<br />\nproblem in placing a good man,\" said Dean Strider, \"It<br />\nall depends on how you define the base for your job<br />\n<br />\nmarket. If your base is group of colleges that are deL<br />\nsignated as 'good', here there has been a definite tightening of the market. But if your base is all colleges in<br />\nthe country, including community colleges, there are<br />\nplenty of openings.\"<br />\nAt Hopkins, apparently, no one has heard of the shortage yet. In a survey where seven different departments<br />\nwere asked if any problems were encountered in placing<br />\nnew Ph.D.'s, there was a 100% placement reported in<br />\neach of departments questioned.<br />\nAt the unfortunate remaining colleges, steps are being<br />\ntaken to alleviate this flood of overeducated refugees.<br />\nHarvard and Yale plan to gradually decrease their graduate enrollments by twenty percent or more, while other<br />\nschools are becoming more selective in graduate admissions.<br />\nA few schools are offering an alternative doctoral program towards a \"Doctor of Arts' degree. This degree<br />\nis meant to concentrate more on producing qualified<br />\ncollege teachers and places less emphasis on the staple<br />\nfood of the Ph.D.--research. The D.A. degree requires<br />\nno dissertation.<br />\nProfessors Owen and Phillips argue against the creation of such saccharin-laureates: \"This is foolhardy.<br />\nIf the Ph.D. program offers the best overall academic<br />\ntraining, and if there is an excessive supply of its graduates, there is little justification for creating another<br />\nless-productive group of doctorates.\"<br />\n\"Graduate education should have a validity that supersedes the vacillations of a particular section of the job<br />\nmarket. The discipline of the mind maywell be as significant as the apparent gathering of knowledge.\"<br />\n<br />\nShouting Breaks Out After Speech by Israeli Minister<br />\nBy HARRY HARPER<br />\n<br />\nApparently annoyed by the excessive<br />\namount of time these questioners took to<br />\nstate their views, members of the<br />\n<br />\nAn angry question and answer period<br />\nfollowed a speech delivered late last week<br />\nby Avram Avidar, the Israeli Minister<br />\nof Information, who called for an end to<br />\nthe fighting in the Middle East and speedy<br />\nnegotiation of the just peace.<br />\n<br />\naudience shouted complaints, demanding<br />\nthat the microphone be turned back to<br />\nthe floor.

Dr. Edward Radford of the School of Hygiene was asked<br />\nto participate in the teach-in at the University of Maryland Law School.

Its rumblings can probably be traced back to the last<br />\ncentury and its bible is a pernicious little book<br />\nby Betty Friedan. It is the Women's Liberation<br />\nMovement.<br />\nThe cult of feminism, not to be confused with<br />\nWomen's Lib, is founded on the absolutely true<br />\nhypothesis that women have been denied, by law<br />\nand rocial convention, the typical outlets for<br />\nsuccess enjoyed by men. That is, they are discriminated against. There are many true believers in the feminist ranks and sentiment grows<br />\nyearly. The pill, the nursery school and the many<br />\nhousehold beneficiaries of technology have freed<br />\nthe American woman from her traditional roles<br />\nof incubator, mother and household maid and, with<br />\nincreased educational opportunities and with the<br />\naid of the media, she has found herself fearless,<br />\ntruculent and free in the midst of a society in<br />\nwhich men pre-dominate.<br />\nThese, however, are not the women of the Women's Lib movement. The modern American<br />\nwoman, described above, may sympathize with<br />\nher extreme exual cohorts, but she is too steeped in the traditional values of society to go out<br />\nand openly antagonize people. Moreover, the<br />\ntypical American woman is increasingly healthy<br />\nsexually, unhypocritical and, put simply, still<br />\nlikes the company of men.<br />\n<br />\nFully Developed<br />\nMlle. de Beauvior, author of The Second Sex,<br />\nspeaks well for the feminist movement and<br />\nwrites in a realistic vein about the relationship<br />\nbetween the sexes: \"Full development of(female<br />\neroticism) requires that--in love, affection, sensuality-- woman succeed in overcoming her passivity and in establishing a relation of reciprocity with her partner.\" Here we have an ax that<br />\nhas needed grinding for a long time. Women have<br />\nalways, until quite recently, had to suppress natural desire and behavior in order to conform to<br />\na social or ethical norm. The sexually repressed<br />\nVictorian woman of Freud's day showed the horror<br />\nof what happens when sexual drives are blocked<br />\nby convention. In fact, as one writer has pointed<br />\nout, only Queens and prostitutes have enjoyed the<br />\nfreedom necessary to indulge in the less saintly<br />\nactivities.<br />\nWomen's Lib insists that women must totally<br />\nliberate themselves from sexual \"slavery.\" Most<br />\nof the spokeswomen for the \"movement\" demand<br />\nwhat amounts to abstinence. In other words,<br />\nfull wing from Victorianism to perversity, bypassing normality. It is quite natural for an organization which espouses such fantasties to attract<br />\na lot of lesbians and Women's Lib certainly has<br />\nits share of them.<br />\nThe organization further believes the modern<br />\nwoman to be a saint, in the Saint Genet sense.<br />\nSince their condition is a mortification of the flesh<br />\nas well as the spirit, something unknown to heterosexual man, they are the essence of saintliness.<br />\n<br />\nBiological Games<br />\nIt is the ignorant disregard for biological reality which makes the movement such a farce. But<br />\nthe journal of the movement is descriptive enough<br />\nof the kind of relationship being sought--No More<br />\nFun And Games: A Journal Of Female Liberation.<br />\n<br />\nTHE WIZARD OF ID<br />\n<br />\nA bizoUP oF WomEN)<br />\nTo E. \" You<br />\nABou-r- TNEire' RiGuTs<br />\n<br />\nField<br />\n<br />\nEnterprises, Inc., 1970<br />\n<br />\nc<br />\n<br />\n5MA514<br />\n<br />\nTalTiratig<br />\n-6<br />\n(aMdit4<br />\n<br />\nvcir<br />\n<br />\nooF*oil<br />\n<br />\n:-!\u2022:.!<br />\n<br />\nIn order to appreciate further the full feeling of<br />\nthe woman in the movement, it is instructive to<br />\nquote Valerie Solanas, the female marksman who<br />\nalmost shot Andy Warhol to death. She describes<br />\nthe female committed to liberation as one who is:<br />\ntoo childish for the grownup world of suburbs,<br />\nmortgages, mops, and baby shit, too selfish to raise<br />\nkids and husbands, too uncivilized to give one shit for<br />\nanyone's opinion of them other than their own, too<br />\narrogant to respect Daddy, the \"greats\" or the deep<br />\nwisdom of the ancients, who trust only their own<br />\nanimal, gutter instincts, who equate culture with chicks,<br />\nwhose sole diversion is prowling for emotional thrills<br />\nand excitement, who are given to disgusting, nasty, upsetting \"scenes,\" hateful violent bitches given to slamming those who unduly irritate them in the teeth, who'd<br />\nsink a shiv into a man's chest or ram an icepick up his<br />\nasshole as soon as look at him, if they knew they<br />\ncould get away with it, in short, those who, by the<br />\nstandards ofour culture are SCUM<br />\nBut you get the point. Miss Solanas' rather ungracious prose reveals that like the radical leftist<br />\nwho despises a cultural stereotype and economic<br />\nsystem, Women's Lib despises everything that<br />\nwoman has ever been to man.<br />\nThe central theme of liberation is, however,<br />\nwoman's sexual role. Leaders of the movement, citing Johnson and Masters as authority,<br />\nencourage their own to practices of automanipulation rather than undergo the ignomity of normal<br />\nsexual intercourse. Roxanne Dunbar,a writer for<br />\nthe movement: \"Sex is a male hang-up. Females<br />\nshould be talking about political strategy, not sex...<br />\nSex is just a commodity, a programmed activity,<br />\nit is not a basic need. If, despite this, genital<br />\ntensions persist, you can still masturbate.\" One<br />\nis reminded of a passage in Orwell's 1984: \"She<br />\nwas a bold looking girl of about twenty-seven,<br />\nwith thick, dark hair, a freckled face, and swift,<br />\nathletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash,emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound...<br />\nround the waist.\"<br />\n<br />\nGot No Time<br />\nBut, as Miss Dunbar reminds us, the nature of<br />\nWomen's Lib is a political struggle and the objective is revolution. Whereas the new left wants to<br />\nabolish the present system, Women's Lib desires<br />\nthe removal of men from positions of power and<br />\ntheir replacement with women. And, women can<br />\nonly do this if certain reforms_ occur at once.<br />\nFirst, abortion must be free, uncontrolled by male<br />\ndoctors and without the stigma of social condemnation. Most insist that the pill should be dispensed<br />\nfree by the government too all females from the<br />\nages of thirteen or fourteen. Second,government<br />\nshould begin research on the \"test-tube baby\"for,<br />\nWomen's Lib states, not until the whole process of<br />\nchildbirth is eradicated will women have full equality. Childbirth,that miracle which poets eulogize,<br />\nis slavery.<br />\nThe ramifications of the movement for society,<br />\nthe family and the male are as yet unknown. The<br />\ndanger of Women's Lib is not itself, but its spillover effect on nominally healthy females. Though<br />\nmost S.D.S. and other radical groups profess<br />\n\"solidarity\" with their \"sisters\" in the \"Movement,\" they are too stupid to realize what Women's Lib might mean for them personally. It<br />\nmeans, as their journal tells us, No More Fun<br />\nAnd Games, or if you lean toward the spiritual<br />\nside, no more love. Women's Lib believes love<br />\nto be outmoded and useless.<br />\nPsychologically sick, biologically sick and<br />\ncontrary to the evolutionary reality of woman's<br />\nrole, Women's Lib humors and amuses, but, by<br />\nGod, watch out.<br />\n<br />\nby Brant parker and Johnny hart<br />\n<br />\n\u2018<br />\n\u2022c<br />\n)<br />\n/4<br />\nNiT HIT 1.<br />\n<br />\nTHEM<br />\n<br />\nOlander<br />\n\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022-\u2022-\u2022-\u2022-\u2022-\u2022-\u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\nvVNA-r<br />\nHAMNER?<br />\n<br />\nYoU Foior<br />\nTo WA RIN1<br />\n<br />\n41F Af3our<br />\nLEFT5.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMarch 17, 1970<br />\n<br />\nReviewing Records, Eren If They Aren't<br />\nBy ELLIOT KRIEGER<br />\nThere's something about the Firesign<br />\n'Theatre that makes me want to trust<br />\nthem. It's partly that their fi.rst record<br />\n(\"Waiting for the Electrician, or Someone Like Him\") was so brilliant. It's<br />\nPartly that I feel that they're working<br />\nOn a form of dramatic communication<br />\nboth very old and very new--and maybe<br />\nvery important.<br />\nThe Firesign Theatre makes records,<br />\nbut, formally, they are kissing cousins<br />\nwith the radio drama-- a dramatic event<br />\ncreated in the studio rather than on the<br />\nstage. True, radio drama imposes some<br />\ndrasitc (and obvious) limitations on the<br />\n'resources of tne drama. But radio drama has its own intrinsic advantages. For<br />\none thing, the audience, participating with<br />\nonly one sense, expects much less of a<br />\ndramatic illusion and is therefore more<br />\nwilling to accept rapid leaps in time,<br />\nSpace and sensibility -- a particularly<br />\n' appropriate advantage for a contemporary dramatic medium.<br />\nAnother thing -- when made in a recording studio, radio drama can have<br />\na near infinite number of characters,<br />\nevents and effect; and a near minimum<br />\nof mistakes. Also, audial performance<br />\nbefore a private audience can create<br />\nsome very intriguing psychologie situations\u2014creation of paranoic reaction,<br />\nsecond person direct address, inclusion<br />\nof the audience in the sound pattern.<br />\nAnd then, considering the marketability<br />\nand accessibility of records, I'm surprised (and sorry) that radio drama<br />\nhas not yet become a trend.<br />\n<br />\nUnstageable<br />\nAs to their first record-- if you haven't<br />\nheard it, you should have. I would call it<br />\na syntactic and a vocal drama. It relies<br />\nheavily on homonym and malaprop and on<br />\n<br />\nan astonishing diversity of accent and<br />\ninflection. \"Electrician\" could not be<br />\nstaged, not even in the mind (as one<br />\ntends to \"stage\" written narratives such<br />\nas novels). I have often wondered whether it could be filmed, and have decided<br />\nthat although it probably could, it should<br />\nnot be.<br />\nPart of the brilliance of \"Electrician\" is its fluidity-- almost as soon<br />\nas one can identify locale, one is shuffled along, without transition, to a new<br />\nplace. Any addition of visual imagery<br />\nwould add either new clues or new confusion. Neither are needed-- the record's timing is perfect. \"Electrician\" is one of those very rare art works<br />\nin which the form is a totally appropriate extension of the content.<br />\nWhat worried me was the content. The<br />\nrecord was an apocalyptic work-- selfconsciously so. Now when a group's<br />\nfirst work is an apocalypse, what happens<br />\nnext? I would say that they either regress, repeat, or become immortal. The<br />\nFiresign Theatre may have done all<br />\nthree.<br />\n<br />\nUncanny Verbal Dexterity<br />\nTheir second record is called \"How<br />\nCan You Be in Two Places At Once,<br />\nWhen You're Not Anywhere At All\"<br />\n(Columbia, CS-9884). The cover of the<br />\nrecord bears the slogan \"All Hail Marx<br />\nand Lennon\"\u2014 beneath pictures of Grouch\u00b0 and John. This gives you an idea of<br />\nwhat to watch out for in \"How Can...\"-bad puns. Side one of this record contains a great deal of vaudeville-like humor; and to my mind, for a group with<br />\nthe talents of the Firesign Theatre,<br />\nthat's just fodder.<br />\n<br />\nYet, their verbal dexterity, their uncanny ability at the double-talk/doubletake and the non sequitor, so apparent<br />\n<br />\nin \"Electrician\", seems to have reached new levels of pointed insanity in<br />\n\"How Can...\": the 'here' is told to go<br />\nto the People, \"who wouldn't say no to<br />\nyesterday, or yes instead of knowing it<br />\nA sign on the highway reads<br />\nall!\"<br />\n\"Merging Buses Ahead.\" A motorist<br />\nshouts, \"Get a hair-lip!\" Also, the Firesign Theatre has even improved its<br />\nability at the use of the syntactically<br />\nambiguous phrase as transition piece<br />\nbetween opposite moods, situations,<br />\nscenes:<br />\n\"What's this all about?\"<br />\n\"What's it all about?\"<br />\n\"It's about this tall; and about this<br />\nwide; and about this country; about which<br />\nI'm singing about...\"<br />\nSee how they can shift, in five seconds,<br />\nfrom paranoid terror to patriotic mush.<br />\n<br />\nStill a Regression<br />\nThere's no doubt that side one of<br />\n\"How Can...\" is the most technically<br />\nmature of the Firesign Theatre's work<br />\nto date. There is enough music included to make it border on the pop-cantata. The use of studio-stereo effects<br />\noften pushes their syntax to either of<br />\nits two extremes -- sound or song.<br />\nIf it is drama, it is non-transcribable<br />\ndrama--a marked contrast to their first<br />\nrecord. They have learned a lot more<br />\nabout -the medium with which they are<br />\nworking. But I have said that it is also<br />\na regression from \"Electrician\". It is.<br />\n\"Electrician\" started in the historical<br />\npast, brought us to the future, destroyed<br />\nthe future, destroyed us (its audience),<br />\nand brought us back to the beginning<br />\nwith a terrifying triple-dot closing.\"How<br />\nCan\" limits its scope to the present,<br />\nand works through the relatively simple<br />\n(minded) device of sarcasm. The warped ideals of America are presented,<br />\nand we laugh, because we know that they<br />\n<br />\nwarped, and because we know that we<br />\nare superior to those who believe that<br />\nthey are not warped.<br />\n<br />\nJohn Q. Smith<br />\nTo my mind, this is a back-slapping<br />\negotistic sort of humor-- not worthy<br />\nof identification with an attempt at serious drama. And this is serious drama.<br />\nThere is a very deft analogy being developed-- a motor journey to the heart<br />\nof America becomes a journey into the<br />\nmind of an American (\"Mr. and Mrs.<br />\n'John Q. Smith; of Anytown, USA\").<br />\nThe materialism which keeps America,<br />\nliterally, moving (symoblized by the<br />\nluxury car) is seen to be analogous to<br />\npsychedelic drugs-- both are external<br />\nand overpriced, both are capable of creating and transforming immediate environment (as opposed to general living<br />\nenvironment), both work primarily on<br />\nthe psychology of America, and both are<br />\nequally useful or useless, depending on<br />\npoint of view. Thus, despite certain<br />\ndiversions, \"How Can...\" becomes a<br />\nrather drastic and startling statement<br />\nabout the nature of life in America.<br />\nSide two-- \"The Adventures of Nick<br />\nDanger, Third Eye\"\u2014 is not as original<br />\nas side one, but it is never-the-less interesting. It is a paradoy radio-program, a take-off on Humphrey Bogart<br />\nand Peter Lorre's \"The Maltese Falcon\"; and is replete with art/life confusion-- actors losing their places in<br />\nthe script or getting caught in each<br />\nother's flashbacks.<br />\nDespite certain shortcomings, \"How<br />\nCan\" and \"Danger\" are worth hearing.<br />\nIf you're intrigued by the possibilities<br />\nof the form, as I am, by all means hear<br />\n\"Electrician\". And I think it's safe to<br />\nhold your breath waiting for the Firesign Theatre's third album.

PETER<br />\n<br />\nIt has come to our attention that Hopkins was offered the option<br />\nto have the NCAA swimming championships here next spring. The<br />\nbid was refused. Director of Athletics Marshall Turner was away<br />\nat a 3-day meeting of the Mason-Dixon conference and was unavailable to comment. It is hard to believe that a school unwilling as it<br />\nhas to allocate funds for its athletes to compete on the national level,<br />\nwould then turn around and in the same breath refuse to hold the<br />\nchampionships here. The reasoning is illogical.<br />\nIf the University wishes to continue refusing any financial support<br />\nto such efforts as sending our athletes to the NCAA championships,<br />\nit seems that it would jump at the chance at sponsoring them instead.<br />\nThis would contribute to increased national exposur<br />\ne in college<br />\nathletic circles, but it now becomes questionable whether this<br />\nis desired. Nevertheless it would prove to be cheaper than sending our<br />\nathletes elsewhere.<br />\nThe NCAA subsidizes the costs of the host university in sponsoring<br />\nthe championships, and any costs at all to the Universi<br />\nty would be<br />\nminimal. There is little doubt that minimal costs<br />\nare balked at as<br />\nwell. Housing of the visiting athletes is not a valid<br />\nargument either.<br />\nAs pointed out by the swimming team's situation,the<br />\nvisiting colleges<br />\nare left to supply their own lodging during the champio<br />\nnships with no<br />\nresponsibility for this left to the host university.<br />\nPerhaps the major<br />\nresponsibility for the University would be to see<br />\nthat the Athletic Center is open and providing a practice pool.<br />\n<br />\nUniversity Refuses MSA<br />\nThis is not the first refusal made by the Universi<br />\nty to sponsor<br />\nregional or national play. Hopkins this year also<br />\nturned down the<br />\nMaryland Scholastic Association basketball<br />\nchampionships. The reason given, a fear of attracting unruly high school<br />\ncrowds. Holding<br />\nthe championships here would have been a<br />\ngreat boost to recruiting<br />\nstate basketball talent with support on controll<br />\ning the crowds given<br />\nby the H-club.<br />\nThe refusals not only seem to be illogical, but<br />\nalso seem to indicate the University's continued refusal to recogni<br />\nzeHopkins athletics<br />\nas an integral part of the University. If Hopkins<br />\ngave any indication<br />\nwhatsoever that it is in fact interested in varsity<br />\nathletics, perhaps<br />\nrecruiting scholar-athletes would be a great<br />\ndeal easier for our<br />\ncoaches and ultimately would benefit the student spectato<br />\nr.<br />\nThe question is not simply one of whether or not<br />\nHopkins will<br />\ncough up money to send our athletes to regional or<br />\nnational championships. It goes much deeper than that. The question<br />\nat hand is<br />\nwhether or not Hopkins wishes to recognize our entire<br />\nathletic program as something relevant to the university.<br />\nSo far it has done<br />\nlittle in that direction. I think it should. The<br />\nathletes and the entire<br />\nstudent body deserve a better deal than what<br />\nit presently has.<br />\n<br />\nWant a Classified???<br />\nUse this easy-to-fill-out form<br />\nHEADING:<br />\n<br />\nBe Snug in Your Bug<br />\nIf you'd like to get around the high cost of living,<br />\nwe have a suggestion.<br />\nCut down on the high cost of getting around.<br />\nAnd buy a V,olkswagen.

He noted<br />\nthat there areapproximately 3100 undergraduates and grad<br />\nstudents and 310 faculty members.\"We<br />\nhave on of the best ratios around,\" Gordon asserted.<br />\nThe registration in the sections is<br />\nnot proportionate, due to the inability or<br />\nrefusals of many students to take sections either early or late in the day.<br />\nThe section instructors have tried to<br />\ntransfer students from one section to<br />\nanother, but the effort has been unsuccessful.<br />\nMany three hundred level courses<br />\nhave more than a hundred students enrolled despite the claim that they are<br />\nintended to be smaller and more informal. There are fewer class hours<br />\nfor the more advanced courses, but<br />\nthere are no sections and thus there<br />\nis no opportunity for general discussion of the topic with the instructor,<br />\nexcept during his office hours.<br />\n<br />\nA good example is the history of<br />\nthe Negro in America, with an enrollment of 201 students and one twohour lecture a week. Professor Hugh<br />\nD. Graham, the lecturer, encourages<br />\nthe students to challenge him during<br />\nclass, but many feel oppressed by the<br />\nsize of the class. Dr. Graham also<br />\nholds flexible office hours, but there<br />\nis no opportunity to join with him and<br />\nother students to discuss the subject.<br />\nGraduate level courses, which can<br />\nbe taken by undergraduates only with<br />\nthe permission of the instructor, remain small and dominated by graduate<br />\nstudents. Many instructors allow undergraduates to take their courses but<br />\nthe work load is a heavy toll to pay<br />\nfor a small class.<br />\n<br />\nThat means that 334 courses are open<br />\nto the undergraduate and 506 are offered to the graduate students. Granted,<br />\nthere are more graduate students here<br />\nat Hopkins than undergraduates, but<br />\nthe<br />\nnumbers are far from being proportionate to the difference.<br />\nOne young sophomore cynicsaid,\"The<br />\nclasses are very luxurious -- wall-towall people.\" Others have complained<br />\nthat there is great difficulty in getting<br />\ninvolved in course matter with so many<br />\n<br />\nothei\u2022 students taking a course. A senior<br />\nclaimed, \"It's hard to dig Black Lit.<br />\nwhen your nose is in your neighbor's<br />\narmpit.\"<br />\nMany students are discouraged from<br />\nattending classes LLziue to the vast numbers of students crowding popular courses. \"I haven't gone to History of the<br />\nU. S. for several weeks because of the<br />\nabsurdity of just trying to find a seat<br />\nin Shaffer 3,\" said a junior concentrating in history.<br />\n<br />\nSmall classes are available even on<br />\nthe introductory level. If you happen<br />\nto be interested in Greek, there is a<br />\ncourse offered in intermediate Greek<br />\nwith only one student. If chemistry is<br />\nmore your pleasure, then the introductory course allows you to get friendly<br />\nwith 198 other people, not including<br />\nthe instructor.<br />\nAnother problem is the number of<br />\ncourses offered to the average undergraduate, as opposed to those offered<br />\nto the graduate student. One hundred<br />\ntwenty-three courses labelled between<br />\n0 and 99 are being taught this semester, 211 on the 300 level, and 295 for<br />\nthe graduate students and those undergraduates who care to brave a six hundred level course.<br />\n<br />\n201 students are enrolled in Dr. Graham's 300 level course, Negro in America.

The<br />\nFEATURE<br />\nmass media harangues on the shortage of jobs for holders of the doctorate.<br />\nNewsweek investigates \"The Doctoral Glut\". The<br />\nNew York Times proclaims \"Ph.D. Alternative Debated\". (It's only a matter of time before the Daily News<br />\nsniffs the hot story--page one--\"Bronx Housewife<br />\nScreams: 'IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?'-No Reply!\")<br />\nThe problem is a classic supply and demand case-too many doctors and not enough openings. The Associate Dean for Administration, Robert Strider told of a Big<br />\nTen school that had four vacancys in its English Department and received five hundred applications.<br />\nThe oversupply is not limited to humanities fields<br />\nalone --Newsweek reports a recent survey that indicated<br />\nthat there were twenty times as many candidates as jobs<br />\nIn physics. In an article in the latest Johns Hopkins<br /><br />\nDean Robert Strider: \"If your base is a group of colleges that<br />\nare designated as 'good,' there has been a definite tightening of<br />\nthe market.\"<br /><br />\nMagazine, Professors Owen .Phillips and George Owen<br />\nquote a study which estimates \"that although 13,200<br />\nnew Ph.D.'s will be available for college teaching in<br />\nJune, 1970, only 7,700 will be needed to maintain faculty<br />\nquality.\"<br />\nAt least part of the problem seems to be the students'<br />\nchoosiness as to where he wants to teach. \"There is no<br />\nproblem in placing a good man,\" said Dean Strider, \"It<br />\nall depends on how you define the base for your job<br /><br />\nmarket. If your base is group of colleges that are deL<br />\nsignated as 'good', here there has been a definite tightening of the market. But if your base is all colleges in<br />\nthe country, including community colleges, there are<br />\nplenty of openings.\"<br />\nAt Hopkins, apparently, no one has heard of the shortage yet. In a survey where seven different departments<br />\nwere asked if any problems were encountered in placing<br />\nnew Ph.D.'s, there was a 100% placement reported in<br />\neach of departments questioned.<br />\nAt the unfortunate remaining colleges, steps are being<br />\ntaken to alleviate this flood of overeducated refugees.<br />\nHarvard and Yale plan to gradually decrease their graduate enrollments by twenty percent or more, while other<br />\nschools are becoming more selective in graduate admissions.<br />\nA few schools are offering an alternative doctoral program towards a \"Doctor of Arts' degree. This degree<br />\nis meant to concentrate more on producing qualified<br />\ncollege teachers and places less emphasis on the staple<br />\nfood of the Ph.D.--research. The D.A. degree requires<br />\nno dissertation.<br />\nProfessors Owen and Phillips argue against the creation of such saccharin-laureates: \"This is foolhardy.<br />\nIf the Ph.D. program offers the best overall academic<br />\ntraining, and if there is an excessive supply of its graduates, there is little justification for creating another<br />\nless-productive group of doctorates.\"<br />\n\"Graduate education should have a validity that supersedes the vacillations of a particular section of the job<br />\nmarket.

Dr. Edward Radford of the School of Hygiene was asked<br />\nto participate in the teach-in at the University of Maryland Law School. Feeling<br />\nthat Hopkins should also have one, he<br />\ncontacted several other people, including Mark Montgomery of the Department<br />\nof Environmental Medicine. Montgomery is now the City Chairman for the<br />\ncoordinating body, the \"Environmental<br />\nTeach-in Committee.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins program will be held on<br />\nthe day after the national teach-in, and<br />\nwill benefit from the national coverage<br />\ncreated by the events of the previous<br />\nday.<br />\nMontgomery stated the basic purpose<br />\nof the teach-in to be educational. He<br />\nagreed with Kermit Baker, the head of<br />\nthe Homewood Campus activities, that<br />\nthey wanted to make people think and<br />\ntry to do something. Montgomery spoke<br />\nof a \"personal commitment\" by individuals as a necessity.<br /><br />\ntion problem they can strive to establish<br />\nrealistic ecological goals, he said.<br />\nAs a center for learning and research,<br />\nthe university could provide much meaningful information for the public, he statDr. Radford accused many<br />\ned.

He claimed Israel's position is unprecedented in<br />\nhistory. \"Israel is the only state in the<br />\nworld that is told by its enemy that nothing less than its extinction as a sovereign state is a solution to the problem.\"<br />\nCalling for the Arabs to \"accept the<br />\nreality of the Middle East situation,\"<br />\nAvidar insisted that all that Israel wishes is an end to the fighting and a guarantee of national sovereignty.<br /><br />\nTeach-In Covers Ecology<br />\n(continued from p. 1)<br />\ntection features Nader.

The steam<br />\nproduced by the heat from nuclear fuel would be cooled<br />\nindirectly by water drawn from the Chesapeake Bay. When<br />\nthis water is returned to the Bay, it would be 10 degrees<br />\nwarmer and contain small amounts of tritium, a radioactive<br />\nform of hydrogen.<br />\nMany ecologists have argued that Federal regulations for<br />\nradioactive waste are too lax, but such objections were ruled irrelevant at the March 2 power plant hearing. Only<br />\npresent criteria, set by the Atomic Energy Commission,<br />\nwere considered for the water use permit for the Baltimore<br />\nGas and Electric Company; the AEC had ruled that water<br />\ncould enter ten degrees warmer from the nuclear plant.<br />\nThe Federal Water Pollution Control Agency, however,<br />\nhas stated that water temperature should not be raised<br />\nover 4 degrees. Meanwhile, consultants hired to study the<br />\neffect of a water change on marine life have not yet determined the temperature range for a \"substantial\" number of<br />\nspecies in the Bay.<br />\nAlthough the decision has not been formally reached, it<br />\nis clear that the BG and E will be permitted to use Bay<br />\nwater for their nuclear plant despite the confusion over its<br />\nadvisability. Before the hearings, a task force reported,<br />\n\"Excavation at the Calvert Cliffs site began before the first<br />\npublic hearing by the AEC, and construction permits were<br />\nissued although no approval has yet been obtained from<br />\n.the Department of Water Resources for permission to use<br />\nChesapeake Bay water to cool the condensers.\"<br />\nThe Nixon Administration has proposed an Environmental .Control Organization to try to involve students in<br />\n, the _preservation of /bur natuial environment, along the<br />\nlines -6f \u2022the Peace Corps.

Its rumblings can probably be traced back to the last<br />\ncentury and its bible is a pernicious little book<br />\nby Betty Friedan. It is the Women's Liberation<br />\nMovement.<br />\nThe cult of feminism, not to be confused with<br />\nWomen's Lib, is founded on the absolutely true<br />\nhypothesis that women have been denied, by law<br />\nand rocial convention, the typical outlets for<br />\nsuccess enjoyed by men. That is, they are discriminated against. There are many true believers in the feminist ranks and sentiment grows<br />\nyearly. The pill, the nursery school and the many<br />\nhousehold beneficiaries of technology have freed<br />\nthe American woman from her traditional roles<br />\nof incubator, mother and household maid and, with<br />\nincreased educational opportunities and with the<br />\naid of the media, she has found herself fearless,<br />\ntruculent and free in the midst of a society in<br />\nwhich men pre-dominate.<br />\nThese, however, are not the women of the Women's Lib movement. The modern American<br />\nwoman, described above, may sympathize with<br />\nher extreme exual cohorts, but she is too steeped in the traditional values of society to go out<br />\nand openly antagonize people. Moreover, the<br />\ntypical American woman is increasingly healthy<br />\nsexually, unhypocritical and, put simply, still<br />\nlikes the company of men.<br /><br />\nFully Developed<br />\nMlle. de Beauvior, author of The Second Sex,<br />\nspeaks well for the feminist movement and<br />\nwrites in a realistic vein about the relationship<br />\nbetween the sexes: \"Full development of(female<br />\neroticism) requires that--in love, affection, sensuality-- woman succeed in overcoming her passivity and in establishing a relation of reciprocity with her partner.\" Here we have an ax that<br />\nhas needed grinding for a long time. Women have<br />\nalways, until quite recently, had to suppress natural desire and behavior in order to conform to<br />\na social or ethical norm. The sexually repressed<br />\nVictorian woman of Freud's day showed the horror<br />\nof what happens when sexual drives are blocked<br />\nby convention. In fact, as one writer has pointed<br />\nout, only Queens and prostitutes have enjoyed the<br />\nfreedom necessary to indulge in the less saintly<br />\nactivities.<br />\nWomen's Lib insists that women must totally<br />\nliberate themselves from sexual \"slavery.\" Most<br />\nof the spokeswomen for the \"movement\" demand<br />\nwhat amounts to abstinence. In other words,<br />\nfull wing from Victorianism to perversity, bypassing normality. It is quite natural for an organization which espouses such fantasties to attract<br />\na lot of lesbians and Women's Lib certainly has<br />\nits share of them.<br />\nThe organization further believes the modern<br />\nwoman to be a saint, in the Saint Genet sense.<br />\nSince their condition is a mortification of the flesh<br />\nas well as the spirit, something unknown to heterosexual man, they are the essence of saintliness.<br /><br />\nBiological Games<br />\nIt is the ignorant disregard for biological reality which makes the movement such a farce.

She describes<br />\nthe female committed to liberation as one who is:<br />\ntoo childish for the grownup world of suburbs,<br />\nmortgages, mops, and baby shit, too selfish to raise<br />\nkids and husbands, too uncivilized to give one shit for<br />\nanyone's opinion of them other than their own, too<br />\narrogant to respect Daddy, the \"greats\" or the deep<br />\nwisdom of the ancients, who trust only their own<br />\nanimal, gutter instincts, who equate culture with chicks,<br />\nwhose sole diversion is prowling for emotional thrills<br />\nand excitement, who are given to disgusting, nasty, upsetting \"scenes,\" hateful violent bitches given to slamming those who unduly irritate them in the teeth, who'd<br />\nsink a shiv into a man's chest or ram an icepick up his<br />\nasshole as soon as look at him, if they knew they<br />\ncould get away with it, in short, those who, by the<br />\nstandards ofour culture are SCUM<br />\nBut you get the point. Miss Solanas' rather ungracious prose reveals that like the radical leftist<br />\nwho despises a cultural stereotype and economic<br />\nsystem, Women's Lib despises everything that<br />\nwoman has ever been to man.<br />\nThe central theme of liberation is, however,<br />\nwoman's sexual role. Leaders of the movement, citing Johnson and Masters as authority,<br />\nencourage their own to practices of automanipulation rather than undergo the ignomity of normal<br />\nsexual intercourse. Roxanne Dunbar,a writer for<br />\nthe movement: \"Sex is a male hang-up. Females<br />\nshould be talking about political strategy, not sex...<br />\nSex is just a commodity, a programmed activity,<br />\nit is not a basic need. If, despite this, genital<br />\ntensions persist, you can still masturbate.\" One<br />\nis reminded of a passage in Orwell's 1984: \"She<br />\nwas a bold looking girl of about twenty-seven,<br />\nwith thick, dark hair, a freckled face, and swift,<br />\nathletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash,emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound...<br />\nround the waist.\"<br /><br />\nGot No Time<br />\nBut, as Miss Dunbar reminds us, the nature of<br />\nWomen's Lib is a political struggle and the objective is revolution. Whereas the new left wants to<br />\nabolish the present system, Women's Lib desires<br />\nthe removal of men from positions of power and<br />\ntheir replacement with women. And, women can<br />\nonly do this if certain reforms_ occur at once.<br />\nFirst, abortion must be free, uncontrolled by male<br />\ndoctors and without the stigma of social condemnation. Most insist that the pill should be dispensed<br />\nfree by the government too all females from the<br />\nages of thirteen or fourteen. Second,government<br />\nshould begin research on the \"test-tube baby\"for,<br />\nWomen's Lib states, not until the whole process of<br />\nchildbirth is eradicated will women have full equality. Childbirth,that miracle which poets eulogize,<br />\nis slavery.<br />\nThe ramifications of the movement for society,<br />\nthe family and the male are as yet unknown. The<br />\ndanger of Women's Lib is not itself, but its spillover effect on nominally healthy females. Though<br />\nmost S.D.S. and other radical groups profess<br />\n\"solidarity\" with their \"sisters\" in the \"Movement,\" they are too stupid to realize what Women's Lib might mean for them personally. It<br />\nmeans, as their journal tells us, No More Fun<br />\nAnd Games, or if you lean toward the spiritual<br />\nside, no more love. Women's Lib believes love<br />\nto be outmoded and useless.<br />\nPsychologically sick, biologically sick and<br />\ncontrary to the evolutionary reality of woman's<br />\nrole, Women's Lib humors and amuses, but, by<br />\nGod, watch out.<br /><br />\nby Brant parker and Johnny hart<br /><br />\n\u2018<br />\n\u2022c<br />\n)<br />\n/4<br />\nNiT HIT 1.<br /><br />\nTHEM<br /><br />\nOlander<br />\n\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022:\u2022-\u2022-\u2022-\u2022-\u2022-\u2022-\u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\nvVNA-r<br />\nHAMNER?<br /><br />\nYoU Foior<br />\nTo WA RIN1<br /><br />\n41F Af3our<br />\nLEFT5.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nPAGE 5<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nMarch 17, 1970<br /><br />\nReviewing Records, Eren If They Aren't<br />\nBy ELLIOT KRIEGER<br />\nThere's something about the Firesign<br />\n'Theatre that makes me want to trust<br />\nthem. It's partly that their fi.rst record<br />\n(\"Waiting for the Electrician, or Someone Like Him\") was so brilliant. It's<br />\nPartly that I feel that they're working<br />\nOn a form of dramatic communication<br />\nboth very old and very new--and maybe<br />\nvery important.<br />\nThe Firesign Theatre makes records,<br />\nbut, formally, they are kissing cousins<br />\nwith the radio drama-- a dramatic event<br />\ncreated in the studio rather than on the<br />\nstage. True, radio drama imposes some<br />\ndrasitc (and obvious) limitations on the<br />\n'resources of tne drama. But radio drama has its own intrinsic advantages. For<br />\none thing, the audience, participating with<br />\nonly one sense, expects much less of a<br />\ndramatic illusion and is therefore more<br />\nwilling to accept rapid leaps in time,<br />\nSpace and sensibility -- a particularly<br />\n' appropriate advantage for a contemporary dramatic medium.<br />\nAnother thing -- when made in a recording studio, radio drama can have<br />\na near infinite number of characters,<br />\nevents and effect; and a near minimum<br />\nof mistakes. Also, audial performance<br />\nbefore a private audience can create<br />\nsome very intriguing psychologie situations\u2014creation of paranoic reaction,<br />\nsecond person direct address, inclusion<br />\nof the audience in the sound pattern.<br />\nAnd then, considering the marketability<br />\nand accessibility of records, I'm surprised (and sorry) that radio drama<br />\nhas not yet become a trend.<br /><br />\nUnstageable<br />\nAs to their first record-- if you haven't<br />\nheard it, you should have. I would call it<br />\na syntactic and a vocal drama. It relies<br />\nheavily on homonym and malaprop and on<br /><br />\nan astonishing diversity of accent and<br />\ninflection. \"Electrician\" could not be<br />\nstaged, not even in the mind (as one<br />\ntends to \"stage\" written narratives such<br />\nas novels). I have often wondered whether it could be filmed, and have decided<br />\nthat although it probably could, it should<br />\nnot be.<br />\nPart of the brilliance of \"Electrician\" is its fluidity-- almost as soon<br />\nas one can identify locale, one is shuffled along, without transition, to a new<br />\nplace. Any addition of visual imagery<br />\nwould add either new clues or new confusion. Neither are needed-- the record's timing is perfect. \"Electrician\" is one of those very rare art works<br />\nin which the form is a totally appropriate extension of the content.<br />\nWhat worried me was the content. The<br />\nrecord was an apocalyptic work-- selfconsciously so. Now when a group's<br />\nfirst work is an apocalypse, what happens<br />\nnext? I would say that they either regress, repeat, or become immortal. The<br />\nFiresign Theatre may have done all<br />\nthree.<br /><br />\nUncanny Verbal Dexterity<br />\nTheir second record is called \"How<br />\nCan You Be in Two Places At Once,<br />\nWhen You're Not Anywhere At All\"<br />\n(Columbia, CS-9884). The cover of the<br />\nrecord bears the slogan \"All Hail Marx<br />\nand Lennon\"\u2014 beneath pictures of Grouch\u00b0 and John. This gives you an idea of<br />\nwhat to watch out for in \"How Can...\"-bad puns. Side one of this record contains a great deal of vaudeville-like humor; and to my mind, for a group with<br />\nthe talents of the Firesign Theatre,<br />\nthat's just fodder.<br /><br />\nYet, their verbal dexterity, their uncanny ability at the double-talk/doubletake and the non sequitor, so apparent<br /><br />\nin \"Electrician\", seems to have reached new levels of pointed insanity in<br />\n\"How Can...\": the 'here' is told to go<br />\nto the People, \"who wouldn't say no to<br />\nyesterday, or yes instead of knowing it<br />\nA sign on the highway reads<br />\nall!\"<br />\n\"Merging Buses Ahead.\" A motorist<br />\nshouts, \"Get a hair-lip!\" Also, the Firesign Theatre has even improved its<br />\nability at the use of the syntactically<br />\nambiguous phrase as transition piece<br />\nbetween opposite moods, situations,<br />\nscenes:<br />\n\"What's this all about?\"<br />\n\"What's it all about?\"<br />\n\"It's about this tall; and about this<br />\nwide; and about this country; about which<br />\nI'm singing about...\"<br />\nSee how they can shift, in five seconds,<br />\nfrom paranoid terror to patriotic mush.<br /><br />\nStill a Regression<br />\nThere's no doubt that side one of<br />\n\"How Can...\" is the most technically<br />\nmature of the Firesign Theatre's work<br />\nto date. There is enough music included to make it border on the pop-cantata. The use of studio-stereo effects<br />\noften pushes their syntax to either of<br />\nits two extremes -- sound or song.<br />\nIf it is drama, it is non-transcribable<br />\ndrama--a marked contrast to their first<br />\nrecord. They have learned a lot more<br />\nabout -the medium with which they are<br />\nworking. But I have said that it is also<br />\na regression from \"Electrician\". It is.<br />\n\"Electrician\" started in the historical<br />\npast, brought us to the future, destroyed<br />\nthe future, destroyed us (its audience),<br />\nand brought us back to the beginning<br />\nwith a terrifying triple-dot closing.\"How<br />\nCan\" limits its scope to the present,<br />\nand works through the relatively simple<br />\n(minded) device of sarcasm. The warped ideals of America are presented,<br />\nand we laugh, because we know that they<br /><br />\nwarped, and because we know that we<br />\nare superior to those who believe that<br />\nthey are not warped.<br /><br />\nJohn Q. Smith<br />\nTo my mind, this is a back-slapping<br />\negotistic sort of humor-- not worthy<br />\nof identification with an attempt at serious drama. And this is serious drama.<br />\nThere is a very deft analogy being developed-- a motor journey to the heart<br />\nof America becomes a journey into the<br />\nmind of an American (\"Mr. and Mrs.<br />\n'John Q. Smith; of Anytown, USA\").<br />\nThe materialism which keeps America,<br />\nliterally, moving (symoblized by the<br />\nluxury car) is seen to be analogous to<br />\npsychedelic drugs-- both are external<br />\nand overpriced, both are capable of creating and transforming immediate environment (as opposed to general living<br />\nenvironment), both work primarily on<br />\nthe psychology of America, and both are<br />\nequally useful or useless, depending on<br />\npoint of view. Thus, despite certain<br />\ndiversions, \"How Can...\" becomes a<br />\nrather drastic and startling statement<br />\nabout the nature of life in America.<br />\nSide two-- \"The Adventures of Nick<br />\nDanger, Third Eye\"\u2014 is not as original<br />\nas side one, but it is never-the-less interesting. It is a paradoy radio-program, a take-off on Humphrey Bogart<br />\nand Peter Lorre's \"The Maltese Falcon\"; and is replete with art/life confusion-- actors losing their places in<br />\nthe script or getting caught in each<br />\nother's flashbacks.<br />\nDespite certain shortcomings, \"How<br />\nCan\" and \"Danger\" are worth hearing.<br />\nIf you're intrigued by the possibilities<br />\nof the form, as I am, by all means hear<br />\n\"Electrician\". And I think it's safe to<br />\nhold your breath waiting for the Firesign Theatre's third album.

The NCAA Championships are being held this year<br />\nat Oakland University, in Rochester, Michigan. The meet will<br />\nlast three days, March 19-21,<br />\nand the best swimmers in NCAA<br />\ncollege divisions will be present.<br />\nOf the eight swimmers from<br />\nHopkins, four are varsity and<br />\nfour freshman (allowed to attend<br />\nthe first time this year under a<br />\nnew ruling). Representing the<br />\nvarsity there are Mike O'Donnell, swimming the medley relay<br />\nand 100 breaststroke, Marc Solomon, in the relay and the 200<br />\nbutterfly, Jim Scott, in the 100<br />\nand 200 yard backstroke, and<br /><br />\nteam captain Rick Ware in the<br />\n200 individual medley.

PETER<br /><br />\nIt has come to our attention that Hopkins was offered the option<br />\nto have the NCAA swimming championships here next spring. The<br />\nbid was refused. Director of Athletics Marshall Turner was away<br />\nat a 3-day meeting of the Mason-Dixon conference and was unavailable to comment. It is hard to believe that a school unwilling as it<br />\nhas to allocate funds for its athletes to compete on the national level,<br />\nwould then turn around and in the same breath refuse to hold the<br />\nchampionships here. The reasoning is illogical.<br />\nIf the University wishes to continue refusing any financial support<br />\nto such efforts as sending our athletes to the NCAA championships,<br />\nit seems that it would jump at the chance at sponsoring them instead.<br />\nThis would contribute to increased national exposur<br />\ne in college<br />\nathletic circles, but it now becomes questionable whether this<br />\nis desired. Nevertheless it would prove to be cheaper than sending our<br />\nathletes elsewhere.<br />\nThe NCAA subsidizes the costs of the host university in sponsoring<br />\nthe championships, and any costs at all to the Universi<br />\nty would be<br />\nminimal. There is little doubt that minimal costs<br />\nare balked at as<br />\nwell. Housing of the visiting athletes is not a valid<br />\nargument either.<br />\nAs pointed out by the swimming team's situation,the<br />\nvisiting colleges<br />\nare left to supply their own lodging during the champio<br />\nnships with no<br />\nresponsibility for this left to the host university.<br />\nPerhaps the major<br />\nresponsibility for the University would be to see<br />\nthat the Athletic Center is open and providing a practice pool.<br /><br />\nUniversity Refuses MSA<br />\nThis is not the first refusal made by the Universi<br />\nty to sponsor<br />\nregional or national play. Hopkins this year also<br />\nturned down the<br />\nMaryland Scholastic Association basketball<br />\nchampionships. The reason given, a fear of attracting unruly high school<br />\ncrowds. Holding<br />\nthe championships here would have been a<br />\ngreat boost to recruiting<br />\nstate basketball talent with support on controll<br />\ning the crowds given<br />\nby the H-club.<br />\nThe refusals not only seem to be illogical, but<br />\nalso seem to indicate the University's continued refusal to recogni<br />\nzeHopkins athletics<br />\nas an integral part of the University. If Hopkins<br />\ngave any indication<br />\nwhatsoever that it is in fact interested in varsity<br />\nathletics, perhaps<br />\nrecruiting scholar-athletes would be a great<br />\ndeal easier for our<br />\ncoaches and ultimately would benefit the student spectato<br />\nr.<br />\nThe question is not simply one of whether or not<br />\nHopkins will<br />\ncough up money to send our athletes to regional or<br />\nnational championships. It goes much deeper than that. The question<br />\nat hand is<br />\nwhether or not Hopkins wishes to recognize our entire<br />\nathletic program as something relevant to the university.<br />\nSo far it has done<br />\nlittle in that direction. I think it should.

He noted<br />\nthat there areapproximately 3100 undergraduates and grad<br />\nstudents and 310 faculty members.\"We<br />\nhave on of the best ratios around,\" Gordon asserted.<br />\nThe registration in the sections is<br />\nnot proportionate, due to the inability or<br />\nrefusals of many students to take sections either early or late in the day.<br />\nThe section instructors have tried to<br />\ntransfer students from one section to<br />\nanother, but the effort has been unsuccessful.<br />\nMany three hundred level courses<br />\nhave more than a hundred students enrolled despite the claim that they are<br />\nintended to be smaller and more informal. There are fewer class hours<br />\nfor the more advanced courses, but<br />\nthere are no sections and thus there<br />\nis no opportunity for general discussion of the topic with the instructor,<br />\nexcept during his office hours.<br /><br />\nA good example is the history of<br />\nthe Negro in America, with an enrollment of 201 students and one twohour lecture a week. Professor Hugh<br />\nD. Graham, the lecturer, encourages<br />\nthe students to challenge him during<br />\nclass, but many feel oppressed by the<br />\nsize of the class. Dr. Graham also<br />\nholds flexible office hours, but there<br />\nis no opportunity to join with him and<br />\nother students to discuss the subject.<br />\nGraduate level courses, which can<br />\nbe taken by undergraduates only with<br />\nthe permission of the instructor, remain small and dominated by graduate<br />\nstudents. Many instructors allow undergraduates to take their courses but<br />\nthe work load is a heavy toll to pay<br />\nfor a small class.<br /><br />\nThat means that 334 courses are open<br />\nto the undergraduate and 506 are offered to the graduate students. Granted,<br />\nthere are more graduate students here<br />\nat Hopkins than undergraduates, but<br />\nthe<br />\nnumbers are far from being proportionate to the difference.<br />\nOne young sophomore cynicsaid,\"The<br />\nclasses are very luxurious -- wall-towall people.\" Others have complained<br />\nthat there is great difficulty in getting<br />\ninvolved in course matter with so many<br /><br />\nothei\u2022 students taking a course. A senior<br />\nclaimed, \"It's hard to dig Black Lit.<br />\nwhen your nose is in your neighbor's<br />\narmpit.\"<br />\nMany students are discouraged from<br />\nattending classes LLziue to the vast numbers of students crowding popular courses. \"I haven't gone to History of the<br />\nU. S. for several weeks because of the<br />\nabsurdity of just trying to find a seat<br />\nin Shaffer 3,\" said a junior concentrating in history.<br /><br />\nSmall classes are available even on<br />\nthe introductory level. If you happen<br />\nto be interested in Greek, there is a<br />\ncourse offered in intermediate Greek<br />\nwith only one student. If chemistry is<br />\nmore your pleasure, then the introductory course allows you to get friendly<br />\nwith 198 other people, not including<br />\nthe instructor.<br />\nAnother problem is the number of<br />\ncourses offered to the average undergraduate, as opposed to those offered<br />\nto the graduate student. One hundred<br />\ntwenty-three courses labelled between<br />\n0 and 99 are being taught this semester, 211 on the 300 level, and 295 for<br />\nthe graduate students and those undergraduates who care to brave a six hundred level course.<br /><br />\n201 students are enrolled in Dr. Graham's 300 level course, Negro in America.
