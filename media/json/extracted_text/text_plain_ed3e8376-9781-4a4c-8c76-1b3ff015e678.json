The student body was, naturally, pleased<br />\n-and delighted; they are looking forward to another successful<br />\nyear, for they like to watch their team win games. Saturday night<br />\nthe Varsity Club, by dint of careful planning, Staged a highly successful smoker for some of the more prominent prep school men<br />\nin the state. Incidently- they managed to make the trophy room<br />\nlook presentable for the first time in the memory of the oldest<br />\nliving undergraduate. \"Fine!\" says the student body, \"An excellent idea.\" For the past few seasons swimming has been the<br />\nonly winter sport at the university. \"What about basketball ?\"<br />\nsays the student body, and \"We want a soccer team.\"<br />\nThus it is plain that this mass of undergraduates, termed the<br />\nstudent body, has excellent intentions. In other words, it has<br />\nthe right idea. It remains to be seen whether the men who make<br />\nit up have as much ability to act as they have to applaud or criticise. They may say that, taken as a whole, they are not athletes,<br />\nthat there is nothing for them to do. But there is one thing that<br />\nthey can do, a thing that must be done<br />\nThe sports at Hopkins need money. A certain amount must<br />\nbe gotten, in order that the existing teams be properly equipped.<br />\nWith a greater sum new sports can be taken up.<br />\nA successful spring season ticket campaign means an advance<br />\nin Hopkins athletics; poor returns mean retrogression. The issue is put squarely into the hands of the student body, which has<br />\nalways been quick enough to advise or encourage. Two or three<br />\nsales per man means success.<br />\n<br />\nGONE ARE THE DAYS<br />\nDuring these spring days, when the activities, one after another are holding elections, and passing the leadership down to the<br />\nmen of the junior class, we notice the almost complete absence<br />\nof a spirit which has too often been dominant on the campus.<br />\nNo longer do such rumors as \"So and so has twenty proxies,\"<br />\nor \"such and such fraternities \u2022 have combined\" fly about the<br />\ncampus. Politics on the campus seems very nearly a thing of<br />\nthe past. The credit belongs to the senior class. Taken as a<br />\ngroup, the seniors are not as strong in numbers or in outstanding<br />\nmen as some of the classes of former years; they have perhaps.<br />\nnot made as many contributions to undergraduate life; but they<br />\nhave accomplished a thing which before seemed practically impossible.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nOne wishing to be cynical might say that they lacked the<br />\nbrains to play politics, but this is obviously an unfair statement.<br />\nThe one thing Which marks the men who have directed the activities this year is a spirit of fair play and of mutual trust.<br />\nThis all may sound like sentimental rot. Sentimental it may<br />\nbe, but it is not rot by any means. The NEWS-LETUR has deplored conditions of former years too often to overlook the present change for the better.

The student body was, naturally, pleased<br />\n-and delighted; they are looking forward to another successful<br />\nyear, for they like to watch their team win games. Saturday night<br />\nthe Varsity Club, by dint of careful planning, Staged a highly successful smoker for some of the more prominent prep school men<br />\nin the state. Incidently- they managed to make the trophy room<br />\nlook presentable for the first time in the memory of the oldest<br />\nliving undergraduate. \"Fine!\" says the student body, \"An excellent idea.\" For the past few seasons swimming has been the<br />\nonly winter sport at the university. \"What about basketball ?\"<br />\nsays the student body, and \"We want a soccer team.\"<br />\nThus it is plain that this mass of undergraduates, termed the<br />\nstudent body, has excellent intentions. In other words, it has<br />\nthe right idea. It remains to be seen whether the men who make<br />\nit up have as much ability to act as they have to applaud or criticise. They may say that, taken as a whole, they are not athletes,<br />\nthat there is nothing for them to do. But there is one thing that<br />\nthey can do, a thing that must be done<br />\nThe sports at Hopkins need money. A certain amount must<br />\nbe gotten, in order that the existing teams be properly equipped.<br />\nWith a greater sum new sports can be taken up.<br />\nA successful spring season ticket campaign means an advance<br />\nin Hopkins athletics; poor returns mean retrogression. The issue is put squarely into the hands of the student body, which has<br />\nalways been quick enough to advise or encourage. Two or three<br />\nsales per man means success.<br /><br />\nGONE ARE THE DAYS<br />\nDuring these spring days, when the activities, one after another are holding elections, and passing the leadership down to the<br />\nmen of the junior class, we notice the almost complete absence<br />\nof a spirit which has too often been dominant on the campus.<br />\nNo longer do such rumors as \"So and so has twenty proxies,\"<br />\nor \"such and such fraternities \u2022 have combined\" fly about the<br />\ncampus. Politics on the campus seems very nearly a thing of<br />\nthe past. The credit belongs to the senior class. Taken as a<br />\ngroup, the seniors are not as strong in numbers or in outstanding<br />\nmen as some of the classes of former years; they have perhaps.<br />\nnot made as many contributions to undergraduate life; but they<br />\nhave accomplished a thing which before seemed practically impossible.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nOne wishing to be cynical might say that they lacked the<br />\nbrains to play politics, but this is obviously an unfair statement.<br />\nThe one thing Which marks the men who have directed the activities this year is a spirit of fair play and of mutual trust.<br />\nThis all may sound like sentimental rot. Sentimental it may<br />\nbe, but it is not rot by any means. The NEWS-LETUR has deplored conditions of former years too often to overlook the present change for the better.
