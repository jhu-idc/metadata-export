The men held together, fought<br />\nhard, and made every play count.<br />\nThe line held like a stone wall; at<br />\nno time was Swarthmore able to<br />\nmake more than a few yards by<br />\nplunging, and when the superior<br />\nweight of the Swarthmore team is<br />\nconsidered, this feature seems all<br />\nthe more remarkable.<br />\nTippett and Bowers were the stars<br />\nfor Hopkins.

Wilkinson kicked, making<br />\nthe score 7 to 7.<br />\nIn the third qtiarter Swarthmore<br />\nwas unable to gain through Hopkins line. Towards the middle of<br />\nthe period MacKissick pulled off<br />\na long forward pass to Howell,<br />\nafter which more passes placed the<br />\nball on Hopkins 20-yard line.

There are<br />\nno requirements or qualifications;<br />\nmerely attend, give your name to<br />\nthe secretary and your dollar to the<br />\ntreasurer! Nothing of very great<br />\nimportance was done, but various<br />\nplans of procedure during the present year were discussed. It was<br />\neventually decided to select some<br />\ninteresting topic, as closely allied<br />\nas possible to the thoughts of the<br />\nmembers, and to discuss, in an informal way, this subject at the next<br />\nmeeting. Mr. Wells, '14, was appointed to open the discussion next<br />\nweek upon woman suffrage. He<br />\nwill support the opposition side and<br />\nwill be t eady to refute the arguments of the adherents of \"votes<br />\nfor women.\" This next meeting<br />\nwill be held on Tuesday, at one<br />\no'clock, in the Donovan Room.<br />\n<br />\nAt the last meeting of the Debating Council, plans for this year<br />\nwere formulated.<br />\nA triangular debate will be held,<br />\nin which Hopkins, Virginia and<br />\nNorth Carolina will be the contestants. Each university will send<br />\nteams to the other two colleges, so<br />\nthat each team will be debating on<br />\nneutral ground. There was some<br />\ndiscussion over placing Hopkins in<br />\nanother triangle with colleges like<br />\nPrinceton and Columbia, but it was<br />\nfound that the schedules of all the<br />\nbig Northern colleges had already<br />\nbeen completed.<br />\nAs the triangle in which Hopkins is entered, however, is one of<br />\nthe most important in the South,the<br />\nBlack and Blue orators will be kept<br />\nbusy enough.

All those who<br />\nattended this initial meeting were<br />\nenthusiastic over the class and the<br />\nleader. The Rev.

Mr. Hogue<br />\nexplained forcibly and intellectually<br />\nthe necessity of every college man<br />\nhaving an accurate and detailed<br />\nknowledge of the life and works of<br />\nChrist. Next Thursday will be devoted to the first study in H.

The men held together, fought<br />\nhard, and made every play count.<br />\nThe line held like a stone wall; at<br />\nno time was Swarthmore able to<br />\nmake more than a few yards by<br />\nplunging, and when the superior<br />\nweight of the Swarthmore team is<br />\nconsidered, this feature seems all<br />\nthe more remarkable.<br />\nTippett and Bowers were the stars<br />\nfor Hopkins.

There are<br />\nno requirements or qualifications;<br />\nmerely attend, give your name to<br />\nthe secretary and your dollar to the<br />\ntreasurer! Nothing of very great<br />\nimportance was done, but various<br />\nplans of procedure during the present year were discussed. It was<br />\neventually decided to select some<br />\ninteresting topic, as closely allied<br />\nas possible to the thoughts of the<br />\nmembers, and to discuss, in an informal way, this subject at the next<br />\nmeeting. Mr. Wells, '14, was appointed to open the discussion next<br />\nweek upon woman suffrage. He<br />\nwill support the opposition side and<br />\nwill be t eady to refute the arguments of the adherents of \"votes<br />\nfor women.\" This next meeting<br />\nwill be held on Tuesday, at one<br />\no'clock, in the Donovan Room.<br /><br />\nAt the last meeting of the Debating Council, plans for this year<br />\nwere formulated.<br />\nA triangular debate will be held,<br />\nin which Hopkins, Virginia and<br />\nNorth Carolina will be the contestants. Each university will send<br />\nteams to the other two colleges, so<br />\nthat each team will be debating on<br />\nneutral ground. There was some<br />\ndiscussion over placing Hopkins in<br />\nanother triangle with colleges like<br />\nPrinceton and Columbia, but it was<br />\nfound that the schedules of all the<br />\nbig Northern colleges had already<br />\nbeen completed.<br />\nAs the triangle in which Hopkins is entered, however, is one of<br />\nthe most important in the South,the<br />\nBlack and Blue orators will be kept<br />\nbusy enough. The council is considering a dual debate with the City<br />\nCollege of New York, which was<br />\nmet two years ago, but the matter<br />\nhas not been definitely arranged.<br />\nThe regular interclass debate, between the seniors and juniors, will<br />\nbe held early next spring in conjunction with the sophomore public<br />\nspeaking contest.<br /><br />\nCharles C.

All those who<br />\nattended this initial meeting were<br />\nenthusiastic over the class and the<br />\nleader. The Rev. Mr. Hogue is<br />\na man who has the broadest sympathy for college men, being a college man himself.

The Rev. Mr. Hogue<br />\nexplained forcibly and intellectually<br />\nthe necessity of every college man<br />\nhaving an accurate and detailed<br />\nknowledge of the life and works of<br />\nChrist. Next Thursday will be devoted to the first study in H.
