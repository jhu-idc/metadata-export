No. 13.<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore, Md., February 7, 1910.<br />\n<br />\nPrice, 5 cents per copy.<br />\n<br />\nTo the A lumni of the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nThe strength of a university does<br />\nnot lie entirely in the size of its faculty, the number of its students, or<br />\nthe length of its curriculum. It lies<br />\nequally in the enthusiasm and loyalty<br />\nof those, who in any capacity, from<br />\npresident and trustees to newly matriculated students, are concerned in<br />\nits welfare. Of this academic community the alumnus is integrally a<br />\npart. He has received a degree, either<br />\nas bachelor, master, or doctor,<br />\nWhich makes him one of a great corporate body and he does not cease to<br />\nbe a member even though he have<br />\nlong since ceased to be actively connected with the affairs of the institution. Upon the faculty rests a heavy<br />\nresponsibility of hearty and self-sacrificing interest in maintaining the<br />\nstandards of the university and in<br />\nsharing in the common effort to keep<br />\nthe pace that is necessary in the face<br />\nof the tremendous competition that<br />\nPrevails today in American academic circles. No university can live<br />\nthat is atrophied in any of its parts<br />\nand in which those entrusted with the<br />\ngnardianships of its reputation or influence are careless of or neglectful of<br />\ntheir trust. That which is true of the<br />\nfaculty is also true of the alumni. No<br />\ninstitution can reach or maintain a<br />\nhigh degree of efficiency or influence<br />\nWhose alumni have separated themselves from it in sympathy as well as<br />\nIn body, and have ceased to have organic connection with the corporate<br />\norganization to which they legally belong.<br />\nNo factor is more conspicuous in<br />\nthe history of our colleges and universities of the present day than the<br />\nPart which the alumni are taking in<br />\nreturning to their alma mater some<br />\nmeasure of that gratitude which they<br />\nowe for the help they have received<br />\nfrom her in the development of their<br />\ncharacters and careers. This debt is<br />\ntoo often forgotten in the pressure of<br />\nOther duties and occupations, because<br />\nIt Is a matter not of business, but of<br />\nsentiment, a debt which cannot be<br />\ncollected by process of law. There<br />\nare few finer things in the world than<br />\nthe expression of loyalty and few<br />\nthat are more disheartening than<br />\napathy and indifference wherever<br />\nthey may be found. A university that<br />\ncannot command the best services of<br />\n:ts men and has lost the devotion of<br />\nIts alumni is likely to become immobile, and immobility is dangerously<br />\nnear stagnation.<br />\nThe living alumni of the Johns<br />\nRonkins University are now more<br />\nthan twenty-one hundred in number.<br />\nThey are \u2022made up of three groups:<br />\n<br />\nThe doctors of philosophy, the doctors of medicine, and the bachelors of<br />\narts with a few proficients in electricity. There are nearly 750 living<br />\ndoctors of philosophy, nearly 600 living doctors of medicine, over 700 living bachelors of arts who are neither<br />\nPh. D's nor M. D's, and 90 proficients in electricity. The bachelors of<br />\narts are in the main living within the<br />\nsmallest geographical circle, a large<br />\nnumber being residents of Maryland<br />\nand the city of Baltimore; the doctors of medicine are more widely<br />\nscattered, though the great majority<br />\nare practicing their profession east<br />\nof the Mississippi River; the doctors of philosophy are spreadall over<br />\nthe country from Canada to Texas<br />\nand from Maine to California.<br />\nHitherto, by virtue of their nearness to the University and because of<br />\nthe compactness of their interests<br />\nthe bachelors of arts have been most<br />\nprominently representative of the<br />\nalumni as a wh6le. They have organized the Alumni Association and<br />\nhave given it something of the character of a Baltimore club; they have<br />\nbeen interested more closely than others in the collegiate life of the university, particularly on the athletic<br />\nside; and they have been able to aid<br />\nthe university by personal influence<br />\nand financial means, partly because<br />\nso many are residents of the city<br />\nwhere the university is located and<br />\npartly because as engaged in the<br />\nmore paying professions or in business they have had the opportunity<br />\nand the means wherewith to act.<br />\nNext in the scale of intimate connection with the university stand the<br />\ndoctors of medicine, a remarkably<br />\nprogressive and enlightened body of<br />\nmen. Their loyalty, which has been<br />\nable to show itself less perhaps in material forms than in expressions of<br />\nattachment, has been due in no small<br />\nmeasure to the personality of those<br />\nwho constitute the medical faculty<br />\nand to the esprit de corps which to<br />\nevery observer is manifest among<br />\nthose. faculty, lecturers, students and<br />\nalumni, who make up the medical<br />\nschool. Amon rf the M. D's thfclasses have been larger and the<br />\nyears since graduation fewer than is<br />\nthe case with the doctors on the philosophical side.<br />\nLowest in the scale of attachment<br />\nstand these same doctors of philosophy. More distant from the university in time and space, finding their<br />\nlot cast generally in other institutions of learning\u2014universities, colres and schools\u2014they have inevitle,<br />\n<br />\nably formed new academic associations and have allowed their new environment to dull their interest in the<br />\nuniversity which gave them their degrees. Equally potent perhaps has<br />\nbeen the absence of any organized attempt on the part of the university<br />\nitself or of the Alumni Association to<br />\nbring them into a closer union or to<br />\ndemonstrate by systematic appeals the<br />\nneed of their cooperation. Behind all<br />\nelse lies the question which has arisen<br />\nin the mind of many an old graduate<br />\nas to the place of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nin the university world. A widely<br />\nexpressed feeling prevails that the<br />\nvitality which characterized the graduate department in its earlier years<br />\nis lessening and that the vigor and<br />\nfreshness which aroused enthusiasm<br />\nat the first is breaking with the lapse<br />\nof a generation of time. Whether<br />\njustified or not this belief has done<br />\nmuch to deaden the interest and sympathy of the graduates on the philosophical side, and where approbation<br />\nis wanting loyalty cannot be maintained.<br />\nBy the vote of nearly a thousand<br />\nalumni and with the approval of the<br />\npresident and board of trustees, there<br />\nwas erected nearly a year ago an<br />\nAlumni Council made up of representatives of all the groups of alumni and from as wide a geographical<br />\narea as was consistent with attendance. This council had its first meeting on May 1, 1909, and at that time<br />\napportioned the work to be done<br />\namong its members. A second meeting was held in December when reports were presented and discussed.<br />\nAmong other things the council authorized the establishment of an official alumni organ of communication,<br />\nand pending the final decision as to<br />\nits character, determined to make an<br />\nappeal to the alumni as a whole for<br />\ncooperation and support. It believed<br />\nand still believes that when once the<br />\nattention of the alumni is called to<br />\nthe situation as it now exists, to the<br />\nfact that the Johns Hopkins University is still a great institution neither paralyzed nor moribund, to the new<br />\nzeal which is aroused among those<br />\nwho are near at hand and know the<br />\nconditions and have absolute confidence in the future of the University,<br />\nthey will respond, not necessarily<br />\nwith money, but with a new sympathy and a willingness to help as far<br />\nas each one is able. The Alumni<br />\nCouncil stands for no group or section; it stands for the whole body of<br />\ntwo thousand graduates, and it turns<br />\nto them on this occasion asking that<br />\n<br />\nthey aid it in its efforts to strengthen<br />\nthe University.<br />\nhe appeal is not<br />\nin this instance for money wherewith<br />\nto complete the fund that the University is trying to raise, but it is for<br />\nthe little that each man can do to<br />\nshow his sympathetic interest in what<br />\nthe council is doing and to further<br />\na course that every one should have<br />\nat heart.<br />\nThe Alumni Council believes that<br />\nevery alumnus can do one or all of<br />\nthe following things and that in so<br />\ndoing he will make possible what the<br />\ncouncil has placed before itself as<br />\namong the necessary ends to be<br />\nsought.<br />\n1. Join the Alumni Association<br />\nand thus make it the organization of<br />\nthe alumni as a whole, the funds of<br />\nwhich will be used not in the interest of any one locality or group of<br />\nalumni, but for the purposes which<br />\nthe council wishes to carry out in<br />\nbehalf of every member wherever<br />\nhe may be. Were the Alumni Association even approximately coincident<br />\nwith the entire body of the alumni it<br />\nwould not only bring into existence<br />\na yearly revenue that would be used<br />\nwisely and economically, but it would<br />\nalso create a unity that would in-crease the loyalty of every man for<br />\nhis alma mater.<br />\n2.<br />\nCooperate in the maintenance<br />\nof an alumni journal, which whether<br />\nissued monthly or quarterly would<br />\nbecome a medium of communication<br />\nbetween the different parts of the<br />\ngreater university and would furnish knowledge of the doings of the<br />\nUniversity on one side and of the<br />\nalumni on the other. Such cooperation can take two forms: a guaranteed subscription for as many years<br />\nas possible, that the publication may<br />\nbe assured of its future; a sending of<br />\narticles or items regarding oneself or<br />\nothers such as will be of interest and<br />\nvalue to all. Scores of events are<br />\nhappening daily among the alumni<br />\nthat should be known, both for their<br />\nown intrinsic importance and for the<br />\nreputation of the University. Knowledge of each of the others is a factor of prime importance in stimulating solidarity among the alumni.<br />\n3. Organize local associations or<br />\njoin those already existing and let<br />\nthese associations become not only<br />\ncenters of Hopkins enthusiasm, but<br />\nalso channels of communication with<br />\nthe council and with the larger association. There ought to be a chain<br />\nof associations throughout the country, each of which will have its<br />\nspace in the new publication, will<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER,February 7, 1910.<br />\n<br />\nAlumni Number<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\nThe News Letter<br />\nALUMNI COUNCIL<br />\nCharles P.

It was almost universal,y expected that this department would remain a small school appealing to that<br />\nlimited number of college graduates<br />\nwho were about to enter the medical<br />\nprofession with the idea of doing<br />\nscientific work along medical lines.<br />\nThe wisdom of requiring an academic<br />\ndegree before entering upon medical<br />\nstudies in this newly established<br />\nschool of medicine was even doubted<br />\nby some of the influential friends of<br />\nthe University, on the ground that<br />\n,file\u201e attendance Would never be large<br />\nenough to jutify its foundation.<br />\nThis department, however, has<br />\ngrown in a remarkable degree. To<br />\nsuch an extent indeed has the attendance increased that at the present<br />\ntime the Johns Hopkins has one of<br />\nthe largest, if not the largest, medical schools in the country if we conicier the schools with rigid requirements fot admission.<br />\nThus far thirteen classes have been<br />\ngraduated, and the size of the classes<br />\nhas steadily grown until the present<br />\nfourth year\u2014about to graduate in June<br />\n\u2014numbers'seventy Men as compared<br />\nwith the original class of 1897 which<br />\nStill larger<br />\nincluded but fifteen.<br />\nnumbers have been granted medical<br />\ndegrees, notably in the yeal 1906,<br />\nwhen eighty-five men received their<br />\ndiplomas.<br />\nDuring the past three years the<br />\nnumber of medical students has markedly increased and the applications<br />\nfor admission show no signs of falling off. Thus one hundred and eight<br />\napplications for the present first<br />\nYear class were accepted by the facility and of the men accepted ninetythree are now in attendance. Unless<br />\nsome unforeseen factors influence the<br />\ndevelopment of the school, there can<br />\nbe little doubt that within a period of<br />\nfive years we shall have between four<br />\nand five hundred medical students in<br />\nAltogether about six<br />\nattendance.<br />\nhundred and fifty men have taken the<br />\n<br />\nJ. H. U. medical degree, and these<br />\nmen are engaged in the active practice of their profession or in teaching<br />\npositions in nearly every State in the<br />\nUnion, possibly the larger number<br />\nbeing located in the Eastern Atlantic<br />\nStates, especially in the cities of Baltimore, Washington, New York, and<br />\nBoston. Our graduates have spread<br />\nall over the West and South as well<br />\nas in many of the more important<br />\ncities of New York and New England, such as Buffalo, Albany, New,<br />\nHaven, and Hartford, Hopkins medical men hold important posts.<br />\nLike her mother University, whose<br />\nideals she has adopted and made her<br />\nown, the medical department by<br />\nmeans of its graduates has taken no<br />\nsmall part in the development of<br />\neducation in other medical schools in<br />\nthis country, and at the present time<br />\nthis University is represented in the<br />\nmedical faculties of nearly all the<br />\nmore important schools. To indicate how the Hopkins medical graduates have attained special prominence in other universities, one may<br />\nmention MacCallum of Columbia,<br />\nHastings and Coe of Cornell, Pratt,<br />\nGay, Christian, and Verhoeff of Harvard, Lyon of Buffalo, Elting, Sampcon, and Winne of Albany, Flint,<br />\nRand.

Since the<br />\nJunior Class has taken the matter<br />\nup and put forth through its committee a definite plan of action, and<br />\nespecially since the newspapers of the<br />\ncity have brought the movement to<br />\nthe attention of the public, a general<br />\nfeeling has been evident that the matter must be settled definitely. Either<br />\nwe must follow the lead of many of<br />\nthe most prominent colleges by adopting the proposed plan or some modification of it, or else we must reach<br />\na definite decision against it. For<br />\nthe benefit of all those concerned in<br />\nsettling the question, faculty and students alike, The News-Letter is anxious to have a general expression of<br />\nthe views of the alumni regarding<br />\nthe Honor System at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThis is not the first time that the<br />\nmatter has come up, and the experience of those who wrestled with the<br />\nproblem before can not but prove<br />\nof value at this time. That the alumni<br />\nare interested we are very sure; some<br />\nletters already published prove that<br />\nBut we hope that their interest will<br />\nlead many others to state their views<br />\nthrough these columns, and that the<br />\nlass organizations will wherever possible take some definite action by<br />\nWhich we may get the benefit of<br />\ntheir opinions. The increasing interest of our graduates in the doings<br />\nOf their successors here, of which<br />\nthis issue of The News-Letter is an<br />\nevidence, can nowhere find better employment than in helping in the deci<br />\nSion of the present problem.<br />\n<br />\nHARESFOOT CLUB<br />\nA temporary cast for the Haresfoot<br />\nproduction has been chosen and rehearsals have already started.

No. 13.<br /><br />\nBaltimore, Md., February 7, 1910.<br /><br />\nPrice, 5 cents per copy.<br /><br />\nTo the A lumni of the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nThe strength of a university does<br />\nnot lie entirely in the size of its faculty, the number of its students, or<br />\nthe length of its curriculum. It lies<br />\nequally in the enthusiasm and loyalty<br />\nof those, who in any capacity, from<br />\npresident and trustees to newly matriculated students, are concerned in<br />\nits welfare. Of this academic community the alumnus is integrally a<br />\npart. He has received a degree, either<br />\nas bachelor, master, or doctor,<br />\nWhich makes him one of a great corporate body and he does not cease to<br />\nbe a member even though he have<br />\nlong since ceased to be actively connected with the affairs of the institution. Upon the faculty rests a heavy<br />\nresponsibility of hearty and self-sacrificing interest in maintaining the<br />\nstandards of the university and in<br />\nsharing in the common effort to keep<br />\nthe pace that is necessary in the face<br />\nof the tremendous competition that<br />\nPrevails today in American academic circles. No university can live<br />\nthat is atrophied in any of its parts<br />\nand in which those entrusted with the<br />\ngnardianships of its reputation or influence are careless of or neglectful of<br />\ntheir trust. That which is true of the<br />\nfaculty is also true of the alumni. No<br />\ninstitution can reach or maintain a<br />\nhigh degree of efficiency or influence<br />\nWhose alumni have separated themselves from it in sympathy as well as<br />\nIn body, and have ceased to have organic connection with the corporate<br />\norganization to which they legally belong.<br />\nNo factor is more conspicuous in<br />\nthe history of our colleges and universities of the present day than the<br />\nPart which the alumni are taking in<br />\nreturning to their alma mater some<br />\nmeasure of that gratitude which they<br />\nowe for the help they have received<br />\nfrom her in the development of their<br />\ncharacters and careers. This debt is<br />\ntoo often forgotten in the pressure of<br />\nOther duties and occupations, because<br />\nIt Is a matter not of business, but of<br />\nsentiment, a debt which cannot be<br />\ncollected by process of law. There<br />\nare few finer things in the world than<br />\nthe expression of loyalty and few<br />\nthat are more disheartening than<br />\napathy and indifference wherever<br />\nthey may be found. A university that<br />\ncannot command the best services of<br />\n:ts men and has lost the devotion of<br />\nIts alumni is likely to become immobile, and immobility is dangerously<br />\nnear stagnation.<br />\nThe living alumni of the Johns<br />\nRonkins University are now more<br />\nthan twenty-one hundred in number.<br />\nThey are \u2022made up of three groups:<br /><br />\nThe doctors of philosophy, the doctors of medicine, and the bachelors of<br />\narts with a few proficients in electricity. There are nearly 750 living<br />\ndoctors of philosophy, nearly 600 living doctors of medicine, over 700 living bachelors of arts who are neither<br />\nPh. D's nor M. D's, and 90 proficients in electricity. The bachelors of<br />\narts are in the main living within the<br />\nsmallest geographical circle, a large<br />\nnumber being residents of Maryland<br />\nand the city of Baltimore; the doctors of medicine are more widely<br />\nscattered, though the great majority<br />\nare practicing their profession east<br />\nof the Mississippi River; the doctors of philosophy are spreadall over<br />\nthe country from Canada to Texas<br />\nand from Maine to California.<br />\nHitherto, by virtue of their nearness to the University and because of<br />\nthe compactness of their interests<br />\nthe bachelors of arts have been most<br />\nprominently representative of the<br />\nalumni as a wh6le. They have organized the Alumni Association and<br />\nhave given it something of the character of a Baltimore club; they have<br />\nbeen interested more closely than others in the collegiate life of the university, particularly on the athletic<br />\nside; and they have been able to aid<br />\nthe university by personal influence<br />\nand financial means, partly because<br />\nso many are residents of the city<br />\nwhere the university is located and<br />\npartly because as engaged in the<br />\nmore paying professions or in business they have had the opportunity<br />\nand the means wherewith to act.<br />\nNext in the scale of intimate connection with the university stand the<br />\ndoctors of medicine, a remarkably<br />\nprogressive and enlightened body of<br />\nmen. Their loyalty, which has been<br />\nable to show itself less perhaps in material forms than in expressions of<br />\nattachment, has been due in no small<br />\nmeasure to the personality of those<br />\nwho constitute the medical faculty<br />\nand to the esprit de corps which to<br />\nevery observer is manifest among<br />\nthose. faculty, lecturers, students and<br />\nalumni, who make up the medical<br />\nschool. Amon rf the M. D's thfclasses have been larger and the<br />\nyears since graduation fewer than is<br />\nthe case with the doctors on the philosophical side.<br />\nLowest in the scale of attachment<br />\nstand these same doctors of philosophy. More distant from the university in time and space, finding their<br />\nlot cast generally in other institutions of learning\u2014universities, colres and schools\u2014they have inevitle,<br /><br />\nably formed new academic associations and have allowed their new environment to dull their interest in the<br />\nuniversity which gave them their degrees. Equally potent perhaps has<br />\nbeen the absence of any organized attempt on the part of the university<br />\nitself or of the Alumni Association to<br />\nbring them into a closer union or to<br />\ndemonstrate by systematic appeals the<br />\nneed of their cooperation. Behind all<br />\nelse lies the question which has arisen<br />\nin the mind of many an old graduate<br />\nas to the place of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nin the university world. A widely<br />\nexpressed feeling prevails that the<br />\nvitality which characterized the graduate department in its earlier years<br />\nis lessening and that the vigor and<br />\nfreshness which aroused enthusiasm<br />\nat the first is breaking with the lapse<br />\nof a generation of time. Whether<br />\njustified or not this belief has done<br />\nmuch to deaden the interest and sympathy of the graduates on the philosophical side, and where approbation<br />\nis wanting loyalty cannot be maintained.<br />\nBy the vote of nearly a thousand<br />\nalumni and with the approval of the<br />\npresident and board of trustees, there<br />\nwas erected nearly a year ago an<br />\nAlumni Council made up of representatives of all the groups of alumni and from as wide a geographical<br />\narea as was consistent with attendance. This council had its first meeting on May 1, 1909, and at that time<br />\napportioned the work to be done<br />\namong its members. A second meeting was held in December when reports were presented and discussed.<br />\nAmong other things the council authorized the establishment of an official alumni organ of communication,<br />\nand pending the final decision as to<br />\nits character, determined to make an<br />\nappeal to the alumni as a whole for<br />\ncooperation and support. It believed<br />\nand still believes that when once the<br />\nattention of the alumni is called to<br />\nthe situation as it now exists, to the<br />\nfact that the Johns Hopkins University is still a great institution neither paralyzed nor moribund, to the new<br />\nzeal which is aroused among those<br />\nwho are near at hand and know the<br />\nconditions and have absolute confidence in the future of the University,<br />\nthey will respond, not necessarily<br />\nwith money, but with a new sympathy and a willingness to help as far<br />\nas each one is able. The Alumni<br />\nCouncil stands for no group or section; it stands for the whole body of<br />\ntwo thousand graduates, and it turns<br />\nto them on this occasion asking that<br /><br />\nthey aid it in its efforts to strengthen<br />\nthe University.<br />\nhe appeal is not<br />\nin this instance for money wherewith<br />\nto complete the fund that the University is trying to raise, but it is for<br />\nthe little that each man can do to<br />\nshow his sympathetic interest in what<br />\nthe council is doing and to further<br />\na course that every one should have<br />\nat heart.<br />\nThe Alumni Council believes that<br />\nevery alumnus can do one or all of<br />\nthe following things and that in so<br />\ndoing he will make possible what the<br />\ncouncil has placed before itself as<br />\namong the necessary ends to be<br />\nsought.<br />\n1. Join the Alumni Association<br />\nand thus make it the organization of<br />\nthe alumni as a whole, the funds of<br />\nwhich will be used not in the interest of any one locality or group of<br />\nalumni, but for the purposes which<br />\nthe council wishes to carry out in<br />\nbehalf of every member wherever<br />\nhe may be. Were the Alumni Association even approximately coincident<br />\nwith the entire body of the alumni it<br />\nwould not only bring into existence<br />\na yearly revenue that would be used<br />\nwisely and economically, but it would<br />\nalso create a unity that would in-crease the loyalty of every man for<br />\nhis alma mater.<br />\n2.<br />\nCooperate in the maintenance<br />\nof an alumni journal, which whether<br />\nissued monthly or quarterly would<br />\nbecome a medium of communication<br />\nbetween the different parts of the<br />\ngreater university and would furnish knowledge of the doings of the<br />\nUniversity on one side and of the<br />\nalumni on the other. Such cooperation can take two forms: a guaranteed subscription for as many years<br />\nas possible, that the publication may<br />\nbe assured of its future; a sending of<br />\narticles or items regarding oneself or<br />\nothers such as will be of interest and<br />\nvalue to all. Scores of events are<br />\nhappening daily among the alumni<br />\nthat should be known, both for their<br />\nown intrinsic importance and for the<br />\nreputation of the University. Knowledge of each of the others is a factor of prime importance in stimulating solidarity among the alumni.<br />\n3. Organize local associations or<br />\njoin those already existing and let<br />\nthese associations become not only<br />\ncenters of Hopkins enthusiasm, but<br />\nalso channels of communication with<br />\nthe council and with the larger association.

It was almost universal,y expected that this department would remain a small school appealing to that<br />\nlimited number of college graduates<br />\nwho were about to enter the medical<br />\nprofession with the idea of doing<br />\nscientific work along medical lines.<br />\nThe wisdom of requiring an academic<br />\ndegree before entering upon medical<br />\nstudies in this newly established<br />\nschool of medicine was even doubted<br />\nby some of the influential friends of<br />\nthe University, on the ground that<br />\n,file\u201e attendance Would never be large<br />\nenough to jutify its foundation.<br />\nThis department, however, has<br />\ngrown in a remarkable degree. To<br />\nsuch an extent indeed has the attendance increased that at the present<br />\ntime the Johns Hopkins has one of<br />\nthe largest, if not the largest, medical schools in the country if we conicier the schools with rigid requirements fot admission.<br />\nThus far thirteen classes have been<br />\ngraduated, and the size of the classes<br />\nhas steadily grown until the present<br />\nfourth year\u2014about to graduate in June<br />\n\u2014numbers'seventy Men as compared<br />\nwith the original class of 1897 which<br />\nStill larger<br />\nincluded but fifteen.<br />\nnumbers have been granted medical<br />\ndegrees, notably in the yeal 1906,<br />\nwhen eighty-five men received their<br />\ndiplomas.<br />\nDuring the past three years the<br />\nnumber of medical students has markedly increased and the applications<br />\nfor admission show no signs of falling off. Thus one hundred and eight<br />\napplications for the present first<br />\nYear class were accepted by the facility and of the men accepted ninetythree are now in attendance. Unless<br />\nsome unforeseen factors influence the<br />\ndevelopment of the school, there can<br />\nbe little doubt that within a period of<br />\nfive years we shall have between four<br />\nand five hundred medical students in<br />\nAltogether about six<br />\nattendance.<br />\nhundred and fifty men have taken the<br /><br />\nJ. H. U. medical degree, and these<br />\nmen are engaged in the active practice of their profession or in teaching<br />\npositions in nearly every State in the<br />\nUnion, possibly the larger number<br />\nbeing located in the Eastern Atlantic<br />\nStates, especially in the cities of Baltimore, Washington, New York, and<br />\nBoston.

Since the<br />\nJunior Class has taken the matter<br />\nup and put forth through its committee a definite plan of action, and<br />\nespecially since the newspapers of the<br />\ncity have brought the movement to<br />\nthe attention of the public, a general<br />\nfeeling has been evident that the matter must be settled definitely. Either<br />\nwe must follow the lead of many of<br />\nthe most prominent colleges by adopting the proposed plan or some modification of it, or else we must reach<br />\na definite decision against it. For<br />\nthe benefit of all those concerned in<br />\nsettling the question, faculty and students alike, The News-Letter is anxious to have a general expression of<br />\nthe views of the alumni regarding<br />\nthe Honor System at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThis is not the first time that the<br />\nmatter has come up, and the experience of those who wrestled with the<br />\nproblem before can not but prove<br />\nof value at this time.
