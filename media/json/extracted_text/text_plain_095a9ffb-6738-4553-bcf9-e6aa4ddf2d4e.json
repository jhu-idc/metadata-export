After one more game with a similar result to be expected, those<br />\nindividuals who are interested in athletics at Homewood may look forward to lacrosse\u2014the one bright spot on the intercollegiate sports program at Hopkins. The basketball team did well with the material on<br />\nhand, but so did the football team. Even the most ardent friends of<br />\nJays' teams are glad to see the \"alibi seasons\" end.<br />\nWhether or not the student body is really vitally interested in intercollegiate sports, whether vicarious satisfaction is greater than that of<br />\nindulging in intra-mural sports can better be discussed after the lacrosse season. No one is interested in teams that habitually lose, but<br />\neven when only one team has a successful season, a different light is<br />\nthrown on the question.<br />\nThat the lacrosse team will have a successful season is practically<br />\ncertain. By a successful season, we do not necessarily mean an undefeated year, but a season during which every contest will be willplayed and a majority of the games won. The most discouraging thing<br />\nto the supporter of a team is not to see a close game lost, but to see his<br />\nteam so outclassed that the opposition sends in the second and third<br />\nteams before the close of the contest. Nothing like this will happen<br />\nthis spring. Hopkins has the hardest schedule ever attemtped, but one<br />\ncan rest assured that the team will be of the calibre of those twelves<br />\nwhich have given Hopkins the representation it now holds in the lacrosse world.<br />\nOnly three positions are left open by graduation, and no one of the<br />\nveterans is assured of his position due to wealth of material. Maryland,<br />\nthe only college team that defeated Hopkins last year, loses the majority of its team while all other oponents lose as many veterans if not<br />\nmore. If one adds to this fact that the coaching staff at Homewood<br />\nis as efficient if not more so than any other group in the country, we<br />\ncan see no reason why this year's twelve should not be one of the most<br />\npowerful in the history of the institution.<br />\n<br />\n\"There was a young lady whose<br />\ndream was to feed a black cat on<br />\nwhipped cream.

After one more game with a similar result to be expected, those<br />\nindividuals who are interested in athletics at Homewood may look forward to lacrosse\u2014the one bright spot on the intercollegiate sports program at Hopkins. The basketball team did well with the material on<br />\nhand, but so did the football team. Even the most ardent friends of<br />\nJays' teams are glad to see the \"alibi seasons\" end.<br />\nWhether or not the student body is really vitally interested in intercollegiate sports, whether vicarious satisfaction is greater than that of<br />\nindulging in intra-mural sports can better be discussed after the lacrosse season. No one is interested in teams that habitually lose, but<br />\neven when only one team has a successful season, a different light is<br />\nthrown on the question.<br />\nThat the lacrosse team will have a successful season is practically<br />\ncertain. By a successful season, we do not necessarily mean an undefeated year, but a season during which every contest will be willplayed and a majority of the games won. The most discouraging thing<br />\nto the supporter of a team is not to see a close game lost, but to see his<br />\nteam so outclassed that the opposition sends in the second and third<br />\nteams before the close of the contest. Nothing like this will happen<br />\nthis spring. Hopkins has the hardest schedule ever attemtped, but one<br />\ncan rest assured that the team will be of the calibre of those twelves<br />\nwhich have given Hopkins the representation it now holds in the lacrosse world.<br />\nOnly three positions are left open by graduation, and no one of the<br />\nveterans is assured of his position due to wealth of material. Maryland,<br />\nthe only college team that defeated Hopkins last year, loses the majority of its team while all other oponents lose as many veterans if not<br />\nmore. If one adds to this fact that the coaching staff at Homewood<br />\nis as efficient if not more so than any other group in the country, we<br />\ncan see no reason why this year's twelve should not be one of the most<br />\npowerful in the history of the institution.<br /><br />\n\"There was a young lady whose<br />\ndream was to feed a black cat on<br />\nwhipped cream.
