Private and<br />\npublic colleges and universities<br />\nall across the country have been<br />\nrestructuring their programs over<br />\nthe past decades to include a<br />\nhigher percentage of women professors, and Hopkins has recently begun its own effort to mediate<br />\nthe discrepancy between the male<br />\nto female ratio in faculty and administrative positions.<br />\nDr. Catharine Evans, the head<br />\nof the Women's Forum and<br />\nmember of the Provost Committee on the Status of Women, said<br />\nabout the issue of gender equity<br />\n<br />\nLoren Rieth<br />\n<br />\nDr. Catherine Evans is a member of the Provost Committee on the<br />\nStatus of Women.<br />\n<br />\nat Hopkins, \"We're way behind<br />\nother schools.\"<br />\nWhile there have been some<br />\nvery encouraging increases in<br />\nspecific departments, overall progress in the effort to hire more<br />\nwomen has been slow. Between<br />\n1979 and 1988, the number Of<br />\nwomen professors in the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences has risen<br />\nfrom five to seven percent of the<br />\ntotal. The number of associate<br />\nand assistant professors have increased by eleven percent; instructors by seventeen percent;<br />\nand lecturers by twenty one percent. Dr. Evans said that a surprisingly low number of women<br />\nhold top-rank positions in their<br />\ntenured<br />\nas<br />\ndepartments<br />\nprofessors.<br />\nDr. Evans believes that fewer<br />\nwomen accept positions at<br />\nHopkins because, \"the climate of<br />\nthe school is not very hospitable<br />\nto women.\" Women are not wellrepresented at Hopkins and that<br />\ncan oftentimes deter a woman<br />\nfrom applying for and accepting<br />\na position with the University,<br />\nshe said. The Women's Forum<br />\nhas been trying to reverse this<br />\nsituation, but up until now the<br />\ntwo-year-old organization of500<br />\nwomen had not received much<br />\nsupport from the University.<br />\nDr. Ashby pointed out that it<br />\nis difficult for women to be the<br />\nminority at Hopkins because they<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Tuition Costs Examined<br />\n'Survey Shows Hopkins as Number Nineteen'<br />\nby Li-Yu Huang<br />\nDespite the steady $1000 increase of tuition each year, and<br />\nthe results of a recent USA Today poll, overall costs of attending Johns Hopkins University is<br />\ncomparable to those costs for<br />\neducation at other private institutions, according to administration<br />\nofficials.<br />\nUSA Today reports Hopkins as<br />\nthe eighth most expensive U.S.<br />\ncollege, with tuition, room and<br />\nboard expenses totaling $20,950<br />\nfor the 1990-91 school year. On<br />\nthe College Board survey,<br />\nhowever, Hopkins does not even<br />\nreach the top ten when examining tuition and fees alone, with<br />\nthe cost reported at $15,380 for<br />\n1990-91.<br />\n\"The actual College Board<br />\n<br />\nsurvey of college tuition and fees<br />\nshows Hopkins as number nineteen,\" Executive Director of<br />\nAcademic Services Bob Massa<br />\nsaid. \"The figures USA Today<br />\nused are weighted figures.

Hopkins, with its rise from<br />\n$14,000 to $15,000, experienced a lower perecentage increase<br />\nat 7.1 percent.<br />\nWith the rise in tuition, financial aid awards have also been increased each year.

Though the ROTC<br />\nprogram at Hopkins offers classes<br />\nthrough the Department of<br />\nMilitary Science in which anyone<br />\nmay enroll, DOD regulations forbid the admission of gays or lesbians into the ROTC proper<br />\nwhich administrators all ROTC<br />\nscholarship money.<br />\nThe DOD policy became official in 1982 and has been consistently upheld as constitutional<br />\nby federal courts. Yet most<br />\nAmerican colleges and universities, including Hopkins, have<br />\nstated policies of nondiscrimination that protect the<br />\n<br />\nrights of gays and lesbians. Many<br />\nof the most vocal opponents of<br />\nROTC admissions requirements<br />\ncite these institutional statements<br />\nof non-discrimination as grounds<br />\nfor removing ROTC from their<br />\ncampuses.

As<br />\nwas often the case, both of the<br />\ndoors to apartment 311 were<br />\nlocked. This didn't necessarily<br />\nmean that nobody was home,<br />\nthough\u2014it meant either that<br />\nnobody was home or that Doris<br />\nwas. Doris had apparantly taken<br />\nall of the horror stories about city life to heart. Miranda often<br />\nwondered if there was some hidden booby trap inside the doorway (easily activated from<br />\nanywhere in the apartment, she<br />\nwas sure)just in case some mad<br />\ndeviant sex pervert murderer had<br />\nfollowed one of her roommates<br />\nhome and stolen her keys (after<br />\nmurdering her, of course). Zack<br />\nplayed upon this time and time<br />\nagain.<br />\n\"Ha ha ha!\" he laughed. \"I've<br />\njust killed Miranda and I'm coming to kill you, Doris! Ha ha ha!\"<br />\nMiranda opened the door.<br />\nDoris was in the kitchen cooking.<br />\nMiranda would stake her life on<br />\nthe fact that, whatever it was she<br />\nwas making, it had oatmeal in it.<br />\n\"Whatcha making?\" Zack<br />\nasked.<br />\n\"Cookies,\" Doris smiled innocently. Miranda didn't buy it.<br />\nShe had to know.<br />\n\"Oatmeal?\" Miranda asked.<br />\n\"You like oatmeal,\" Doris<br />\ninsisted.<br />\n\"I like oatmeal in moderation,<br />\nthank you, Doris.\"<br />\n\"Well, it's good for you.\"<br />\n\"So is moderation.\"<br />\nDoris loved oatmeal. Doris<br />\nloved to cook oatmeal. Doris loved to cook oatmeal into anything<br />\nelse she cooked. Miranda was<br />\nquite certain that Doris had had<br />\nsome sort of intense oatmeal experience in her childhood<br />\ndevelopment that affected her<br />\npresent mental state. Still, Miranda had been rooming with Doris<br />\nsince freshman year, so, while<br />\nshe wasn't quite sick of Doris,<br />\nshe was certainly sick of oatmeal.<br />\n\"Chocolate chip\u2022 is nice,\"<br />\nto<br />\nattempted<br />\nMiranda<br />\n..<br />\ncompromise.<br />\n\"Fine. How's chocolate chip<br />\n<br />\noatmeal?\"<br />\nIn the three years she had<br />\nknown Doris, she had never won<br />\nan oatmeal argument. Except<br />\nmaybe the one about the oatmeal<br />\nhamburgers. Even Zack wouldn't<br />\neat them.<br />\n\"Great,\" Miranda sighed.<br />\n\"Well, then I'll need some<br />\nchocolate chips.\" Doris put on<br />\nher best innocent little darling<br />\n<br />\nDoris had had some<br />\nsort of intense<br />\noatmeal experience<br />\nin her childhood<br />\ndevelopment<br />\n<br />\nBig Laughs on Campus<br />\nThere's an old campus joke: Two inmates are sitting in Baltimore County Jail, exchanging their woes.<br />\nThe first tells of an unsuccessful attempt to steal his<br />\nlandlord's car\u2014standard stuff, the guy caught him and<br />\ncalled the police. The second inmate, however, hedges<br />\nwhen telling the story. He was pulling a burglary, yeah,<br />\nup in the north part of Baltimore. Where? the first guy<br />\nasks. Johns Hopkins, says the second, the University. The first inmate seems impressed for a while; then<br />\nfurrows his brows. Wait a minute, he says, the guards<br />\nup there don't got no guns. I know, says the second<br />\nguy. So how did they get you? the other asks.<br />\nDoughnuts, answers the second, they threw stale<br />\ndoughnuts at me and knocked me unconscious. The<br />\nfirst inmate whistles through his teeth. Man, he says,<br />\nyou don't mess with those guys.<br />\nIt's only one joke of dozens, perhaps hundreds, in<br />\ncirculation about the Johns Hopkins Security force.<br />\nAlthough the punchlines vary, the essence of the<br />\nhumor\u2014that Security is ill-equipped to protect Hopkins<br />\nstudents\u2014is remarkably consistent. It's a serious<br />\nallegation, and one that deserves some scrutiny.<br />\nFirst, it's doubtful that Security's primary role is<br />\nto protect Hopkins students. Consider the territory,<br />\nfirepower, and daily tasks of a Security officer. He<br />\npatrols the campus looking for suspicious characters;<br />\nsupervises campus events; writes parking tickets;<br />\nassists when there are problems in University housing; and unlocks doors for wisecracking<br />\nundergraduates. He carries no gun, tabulates campus<br />\ncrime statistics, and maybe even helps to assemble the<br />\nsecurity bulletins that circulate every so often.<br />\nGlamorous it isn't. But it's what these men\u2014and they<br />\ndo all seem to be men\u2014are hired to do.<br />\nSecond, and consequently, the University seems to<br />\nregard Security less as a force than a presence: It's<br />\nhere to watch over the campus. This includes students,<br />\nfaculty, and staff, of course, but not them exclusively. There are capital investments to protect, buildings<br />\nto patrol, and there is business to conduct\u2014things that<br />\nseem as'important to security as the safety of students.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nAn Expatriate Writes, Wishing Well; Words for a 'Mindless<br />\nCampus Tabloid', In Defense of the Biology Dept.<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIt was encouraging to read in your<br />\nSeptember 21 News-Letter that Dean<br />\nArmstrong is now taking great interest in rebuilding the French Program. In view of his statement that<br />\n\"'wet are not looking to recreate the<br />\nold department, but to build a new<br />\nteam of faculty that will have a<br />\nstronger focus on modern twentieth<br />\ncentury French culture and<br />\nliterature,'\u2022 it might be useful to<br />\nremember that the three remaining<br />\nfaculty members in the French<br />\ndepartment are specialists of the sixteenth (Defaux), seventeenth<br />\n<br />\nrefused to show it. Sean repeatedly<br />\nasked to see it, to which the band<br />\nmember became hostile. Eventually<br />\nhe capitulated, showed the bracelet,<br />\nand was let in.

As one who<br />\nhas been involved in premedical advising longer than most of the<br />\nreaders of the News-Letter have lived, let me dispel some of the<br />\nmisconceptions contained in your<br />\nOpinion column of September 28<br />\nand in Andrea Marsh's article on the<br />\nBiology Major.<br />\nThe Biology Department's program is by no stretch of the imagination oriented toward medical school<br />\nrequirements. In general, the stated<br />\nbiology entrance requirements for<br />\nmedical school is one year of general<br />\nbiology with laboratory. Some<br />\nschools recommend additional<br />\ncourses analogous to those which<br />\nyour article listed as being essential<br />\nfor other health related careers.<br />\n<br />\nPremedical students from Hopkins<br />\nmajor in many areas other than<br />\nBiology, ranging from Biomedical<br />\nEngineering to the Writing<br />\nSeminars. The one course that<br />\nmakes our students stand out,<br />\nregardless of their major, is<br />\nMolecular Cell Biology. Our<br />\npremedical students were forced to<br />\ntake the predecessors of this course<br />\nwhen a freshman general biology<br />\ncourse was eliminated about thirty<br />\nyears ago.<br />\nHistorically, the strength of<br />\nHopkins has been to be innovative<br />\nand to concentrate on areas perceived as important for the future. The<br />\nHopkins Department of Biology was<br />\namong the first to recognize that a<br />\nreal understanding of the subject<br />\ncould be obtained only after a<br />\nthorough grounding in chemistry.<br />\nThe present curriculum was<br />\ndeveloped for the benefit of those<br />\nplanning careers in biology.<br />\nPremeds had to adapt. Needless to<br />\nsay this background has proven to be<br />\nexcellent preparation for future<br />\nphysicians.<br />\nAt a time when medical students<br />\nwith traditional backgrounds were<br />\nhaving difficulties with concepts now<br />\ncommon in Introductory Chemistry,<br />\nHopkins graduates were able to<br />\nunderstand much of the current<br />\nresearch. The burgeoning of<br />\nbiochemical applications in medical<br />\npractice is an indication that our<br />\nDepartment of Biology made the<br />\nright decision thirty years ago. The<br />\ndecision was right for premedical<br />\n<br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors.

However any<br />\nchanges should be in the direction of<br />\npreparing our students for the<br />\nbiology of the year 2020, not by<br />\nreturning to courses which were out<br />\nof date in 1960.<br />\nI wish Ms. Luzetti had talked to<br />\nme about her plans to become a<br />\nphysicians's assistant. If she entered<br />\nHopkins with this goal, she chose the<br />\nwrong school. If her original goal<br />\nwas medicine, she most probably has<br />\nmade a poor career choice. For<br />\nseveral years Hopkins had a School<br />\nof Allied Health Sciences which<br />\ntrained physician's assistants. lf the<br />\ngraduates of that program are<br />\ntypical, only very special people are<br />\nsatisfied with the limited care they<br />\nare permitted to deliver. Over half<br />\nof the graduates later applied to<br />\nmedical school.<br />\nIt has been my experience that individuals who originally planned a<br />\ncareer as a physician and who do not<br />\ngo to medical school are most happy in their ultimate career choice if<br />\nthey enter fields not too closely allied<br />\nto medicine. One of the duties I have<br />\nas health professions advisor is to<br />\nhelp individuals decide if medicine<br />\nis the right profession for them.<br />\nRarely would the courses your article propose be necessary for individuals who have made changes in<br />\ntheir career goals after entering<br />\nHopkins as premeds.<br />\nJohn W. Gryder<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a graduate student in the<br />\nDepartment of Biology, I would like<br />\nto respond to last week's editorial<br />\nregarding the department's<br />\ncurriculum.<br />\nI do sympathize with students who<br />\nare seeking better preparation in<br />\nhealth related fields. I agree that a<br />\ndemand at Hopkins for such courses<br />\n(.'onnnued on page 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\n<br />\nHILLCREST CLINIC<br />\nPrompt confidential help<br />\n<br />\nA Young Trustee Returns at Least by Mail<br />\nContinued from page 4<br />\nas anatomy is justified. I must<br />\ndisagree with placing the blame for<br />\nthe lack of such courses entirely on<br />\nthe Department of Biology.<br />\nA good anatomy course need not<br />\nbe taught exclusively by the biology<br />\ndepartment. At MIT, for instance,<br />\nanatomy and physiology courses are<br />\ntaught by the department of Nutrition and Food Science. Here at<br />\nHopkins, one could easily argue that<br />\nthe research of the Department of<br />\nBiophysics is best suited to teaching<br />\nanatomy. Anatomy could also be offered jointly by more than one<br />\ndepartment, perhaps as part of the<br />\nbiomedical engineering program.<br />\nPerhaps the best alternative would be<br />\nto hire a medical school professor to<br />\nteach a course at Hopkins.<br />\nThe Department of Biology must<br />\nprepare students for careers in<br />\nbiology, not just for medical school.<br />\nIn the past two years, the biology<br />\ndepartment has not offered<br />\nmicrobiology, immunology, or<br />\ngeneral biology to undergraduate<br />\nmajors. Such courses would help<br />\nstudents who wish to pursue careers<br />\nin biology. To ignore these needs<br />\nand add health-related classes would<br />\nfurther the existing slant toward premeds in this department.<br />\nBob Lessick<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI recently recieved my copy of the<br />\nSept. 21 edition of the Newsletter in<br />\nwhich I read:<br />\n\"The Johns Hopkins University<br />\ndoes not discriminate on the basis of<br />\nrace, sex, color, religion, homosexuality, nationality or ethnic origin,<br />\nhandicap or veteran status in any student program administered by the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nThis statement is one of the central pillars of what Hopkins stands<br />\nfor. Other pillars include freedom of<br />\nexpression and service to the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe above quote was the start of<br />\nan excellent letter by Paul Del<br />\nGrosso which I feel every student<br />\nand administrator at Hopkins should<br />\nread. Mr. Del Grosso's line of<br />\ndiscussion and reasoning are crystal<br />\nclear and correct. He repeats what<br />\nseveral students, staff, faculty, administrators and hopefully trustees<br />\nall over the country have been saying: ROTC is an exception to the<br />\nabove university principles and<br />\nthat wrong!!<br />\nSo what are Hopkins leader's (including adminstrators and trustees)<br />\noptions?<br />\n(1) Phase out ROTC without hur-<br />\n<br />\nThe Right Angle<br />\nKevin McCrea<br />\nContrary to some reports,<br />\nconservatives have hearts, too.<br />\nBut conservative displays of<br />\ncompassion do not match those<br />\nof the left in terms of their<br />\n\"generosity.\" Conservatives,<br />\nhowever, realize that the wanton throwing of money at problems fails to provide any<br />\nlong-term solutions to the problems of the country; instead,<br />\nthey remember that such basic<br />\nconcepts as \"incentive\" and<br />\n\"free enterprise\" can and do<br />\nactually work in raising people from squalid living<br />\nconditions.<br />\nConsider the problem of<br />\neither those living in<br />\ngovernment-subsidized housing or those who are homeless.<br />\nYes, a problem does exist:<br />\nthere are tot) many people living in intolerable conditions.<br />\nYet to lay all of the blame for<br />\nthe social ailments of the day<br />\non the shoulders of the Reagan<br />\nand Bush administrations is<br />\nquite naive\u2014remember that<br />\nover a quarter of a century has<br />\npassed since Lyndon Johnson<br />\ninstituted his \"Great Society\"<br />\nreforms.<br />\nThis problem will almost<br />\ncertainly never completely<br />\ndisappear in a country which<br />\nstresses equality of opportunity<br />\nover equality of result. Of<br />\ncourse, the housing problem<br />\nwould be much less in a country which did emphasize the<br />\nlatter. But even I won't accuse<br />\nthe \"dreaded liberal antagonists\" of looking upon the<br />\nSoviet Union as a role model<br />\n<br />\nBut what should the government do to best combat this<br />\nproblem? Before answering<br />\nthis question, though, past approaches which have failed<br />\nmust be re-examined.<br />\nFirst of all, obviously, the<br />\npre-New Deal, \"classic\" conservative approach of completely ignoring the poor just<br />\ndoes not work.

For Hopkins this<br />\nmay seem more difficult considering<br />\nthe level of support which several<br />\naspects of the university receives<br />\nfrom the military/defense sectors.<br />\nBut are our root values and pillars<br />\nfor sale or up for discussion? No,<br />\nthey are not; we should not be flexible when it comes to the core goals<br />\nof this university.<br />\nIf we are to create or maintain a<br />\ntruly remarkable University, we do<br />\nnot only need excellent scholars,<br />\n\"mo money,\" facilities, and<br />\nresearch. It also entails the construction of an environment in which all<br />\npersons at Hopkins' institutions<br />\nrespect and promote individuality<br />\nand diversity. It requires that all of<br />\nus look down on bigots, denial and<br />\ndiscrimination of all sorts. It requires<br />\nthat we treat each member of the<br />\ncommunity with the same dignity<br />\nand fairness that we would expect<br />\nfrom others.<br />\nSo? It is important that the dean's<br />\ncommittee be formed now and a<br />\nresponse from the University be seen<br />\nwithin the next six months. Call, or<br />\nbetter still, write the Provost or Dean<br />\nof Institutional Affairs and let them<br />\nknow how you feel about this<br />\n\"curious anomoly\" of discrimination based on sexual orientation at<br />\nHopkins. It is wrong and should be<br />\nstopped!<br />\nWinston Vaughan<br />\nA&S\u2014Hopkins '87, Stanford med<br />\nstudent and Hopkins Young Trustee<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe debate in these pages over<br />\nwhether or not ROTC should be<br />\nallowed to remain on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus has drifted, perhaps intentionally, and now revolves around<br />\nthe justifiability of the Department<br />\n<br />\nFOR APPOINTMENTS CALL:<br />\n<br />\nof Defense's exclusion of gays and<br />\nlesbians from military service and<br />\nthe value of the ROTC program to<br />\nthis university. While both issues are<br />\nworthy of close and objective<br />\nscrutiny, neither one is of paramount<br />\nconcern right now. Rather, the one<br />\nquestion which the Hopkins community can and must answer is \"Can<br />\nan academic institution maintain its<br />\nintegrity while lending support to (or<br />\nderiving support from)any organization which discriminates on the basis<br />\nof race, color, gender, heritage,<br />\npolitical persuasion, or sexual<br />\npreference?\" I believe, and our administration outwardly affirms, that<br />\nsuch discrimination is inconsistent<br />\nwith the goals and principles of a<br />\nuniversity such as ours.<br />\nIn this light, whether or not we<br />\nallow the ROTC program to remain<br />\non campus is no longer an issue unto itself, but rather becomes another<br />\nexample of the continuing gap between our actions and our so vocally<br />\nproclaimed policy. It is now of the<br />\nsame ilk as whether to retain investments in South Africa, whether<br />\nto allow discriminatory student<br />\ngroup to use university facilities, and<br />\nwhether to accept research grants<br />\nfrom sources such as the DoD. Nondescrimination is our stated policy,<br />\nour principle: there can be no exceptions and no compromise. We have<br />\nclaimed the moral high ground, and<br />\nnow we must stand on it.<br />\nAt the same time, we must execute<br />\nour judgment charitably. Immediate<br />\nremoval of ROTC from Hopkins<br />\nwould necessarily interrupt the<br />\neducation of those students who depend on its scholarships to pay their<br />\ntuition. Providing University support<br />\nfor those who would otherwise be<br />\nleft stranded by such action is morally appealing but perhaps not affordable. Allowing current participants<br />\nto finish the program while refusing<br />\nto let new students in is not<br />\nworkable, either, since an integral<br />\npart of the upperclassman's ROTC<br />\nexperience is the training of new<br />\ncadets. Rather, I would suggest giving the Department of Defense three<br />\nto five years to move the ROTC program to a different location, where<br />\nit can continue under auspices other<br />\nthan the University's. If the DoD<br />\ntruly has an interest in continuing the<br />\nprogram in this area, it could use one<br />\nof the many nearby military<br />\nfacilities. Moreover, if the ROTC<br />\nprogram paid the participants directly rather than the University, then<br />\nthe administration would not be able<br />\nto question students' involvement in<br />\nit. Participation would then be a matter of personal choice and beyond the<br />\nUniversity's jurisdiction. Such an arrangement, while undoubtedly inconvenient for the DoD, is not impossible and would preserve the<br />\nscholarship opportunities for those<br />\nfortunate enough to be eligible while<br />\nmaintaining the distance between the<br />\npolicies of the defense department<br />\nand the Hopkins community.<br />\nCertainly, it is also appropriate to<br />\nwrite to our Senators and Congressmen regarding our national integrity, as has been suggested.<br />\nNonetheless, now it is time to put<br />\nour own house in order.<br />\nDave Storm<br />\n<br />\nDon't walk into the December LSAT unprepared!

What about the importance of those gay cadets who have<br />\nbeen kicked out of ROTC, not<br />\nbecause of their service record, but<br />\nbecause of their sexual orientation?<br />\nWho will pay back the past scholarship money the Armed Service<br />\ndemands from these gay cadets who<br />\nare also \"our best scholars, athletes<br />\nand citizens\" (J.P. Kelly) and who<br />\nobviously needed financial assistance<br />\njust as much as anyone else? All<br />\nGALA members desire is for the<br />\nArmed Service to end its hypocrisy<br />\nand acknowledge people who are not<br />\nwaiting to get into the military, but<br />\nalready form an essential,\"important,\" part.<br />\nJ.P. Kelly also writes that reversing discrimination \"by going to the<br />\ncourt would be a much more productive and responsible move on<br />\n<br />\nScrew the Right Thing<br />\n<br />\nGALA's part and would be in the<br />\nbest interest of our nation.\" What<br />\nMr. Kelly fails to realize is that cases<br />\nregarding the military's general<br />\ndiscrimination policy have already<br />\ngone to the Supreme Court which<br />\nhas upheld the Armed Service's right<br />\nto discriminate since this is part of<br />\nmilitary law. The Court can only<br />\nuphold law, not change it. The Court<br />\nso far has refused to hear any case<br />\nregarding ROTC discrimination<br />\nspecifically since it feels its ruling<br />\nconcerning the general miilitary applies to all parts of the military.<br />\nThus, changing law is the only way<br />\nan end to discrimination will come<br />\nabout.<br />\nChanging law requires a little<br />\nmore than writing letters to our<br />\ngovernment as Mark E. Bateman implies when he writes,' A positive<br />\nmethod of advocating this change<br />\nwould be to deal with your Congressmen and Senators.\" If any of<br />\nthese \"best scholars, athletes and<br />\ncitizens\" actually believe you can<br />\nchange law simply by writing letters<br />\nto Congressmen and Senators, I<br />\nquestion their grasp of the political<br />\nsystem in this or any country. Applying direct pressure on government to change flawed policies is a<br />\ntried and true method for social<br />\nchange and applying this pressure in<br />\na way that threatens the military's<br />\nability to train its military officers on<br />\nthe best college and university campuses is certainly frontline pressure<br />\nand not \"back door pressure\" as<br />\nMr. Bateman claims.<br />\nUnfortunately, whatever the approach one takes on this issue, some<br />\nwill lose, at least in the short term.<br />\nThe approach GALA recommends,<br />\nwhich is one that is being followed<br />\non other college campuses, is to<br />\ngradually phase out ROTC by allowing those already in ROTC to finish<br />\nthe program, but not allowing new<br />\nstudents to enter. Yes, those new<br />\nstudents, which includes those gays<br />\n<br />\nand lesbians who choose to sneak into ROTC, will lose the financial<br />\nbenefits they could have otherwise<br />\nattained. Yes, this country will lose<br />\nthe ability to train officers on the best<br />\ncollege campuses. But, neither the<br />\ngay and lesbian community nor the<br />\npeople serving in the military should<br />\nbe to blame for this loss. The<br />\nhypocrisy of the leaders in our<br />\ngovernment and military should be<br />\nto blame and are the only ones deserving blame. Once the people of this<br />\ncountry see how this hypocrisy can<br />\nbe quickly and harmlessly changed<br />\nin a way that benefits everyone,<br />\nchange will come. That forcing this<br />\nchange must come from the university system reflects the fact that it is<br />\none of the few institutions on a national level to commit itself in<br />\nwriting to preventing discrimination<br />\nagainst gays and lesbians.<br />\nPerhaps Mr. Kelly's logic\u2014<br />\n\"Realize that you are only one faction in a world of many.

Although it was an<br />\nearnest attempt to rectify the<br />\ncountry's problems, it failed.<br />\nSo what might work? One<br />\nconservative who has a novel<br />\napproach to the problem is<br />\nJack Kemp, the once and<br />\nfuture presidential candidate<br />\nwho currently serves as the<br />\nsecretary of HUD. He has incorporated conservative ideals<br />\nabout free enterprise into a<br />\nprogram called HOPE\u2014Home<br />\nOwnership and Opportunity<br />\nfor People Everywhere. This<br />\nprogram encourages tenants of<br />\npublic housing to buy their<br />\nown apartments and aids those<br />\ntenants who want to buy out<br />\ndevelopers who plan to convert<br />\ntheir units into condos.<br />\nKemp recognizes the trappings of the \"plantation-style\"<br />\nwelfare system, which prevent<br />\nthose dependent upon the<br />\ngovernment from bettering<br />\ntheir condition without<br />\nforfeiting their aid. \"The War<br />\non Poverty has noble purposes,\" Kemp told the New<br />\nRepublic, \"but it turned the incentive structure upside down.<br />\n\"The problem isn't that<br />\nAmerica is caught immutably<br />\nbetween two economies\u2014a<br />\nmainstream economy in which<br />\n<br />\npeople respond rationally to<br />\nrewards like education, vicility, and opportunity, and a<br />\npoverty element that is written<br />\noff because we think they<br />\nwouldn't respond to rewards.<br />\nI disagree, politically and<br />\nmorally.

One of Kemp's favorite<br />\nexamples is Kimi Gray, who<br />\nsuccessfully transformed a<br />\nrun-down public housing complex in Washington, D.C. into a model of tenant-owned<br />\nhousing.<br />\nSuch a success story contrasts with the horrors of a tale<br />\nfrom the traditional welfare<br />\nsystem, which sharply curtails<br />\nincentive to save and earn<br />\nmoney.

But that's<br />\nnot the case for Baltimore<br />\nMuseum of Art's Access to Art<br />\nExhibit. The first exhibit created<br />\nas part of the Museum of<br />\nAmerican Folk Arts' program,<br />\nAccess to Art, is titled \"Bringing Folk Art Closer,\" showing<br />\nuntil November 11. The objects<br />\nof folk art from the 19th and 20th<br />\ncenturies are displayed to allow<br />\nviewers to touch them.<br />\nFolk art is made by folk artists<br />\nwho have little or no academic<br />\ntraining in art. For the most part,<br />\nthe folk art on display serves a<br />\nfunction. Yet the craftsmanship<br />\ntranscended function and became<br />\ndecoration as well. One example<br />\nis the display of quilts in the exhibition. The craft tradition of<br />\nquilt making brought out the<br />\nmakers' innate sense of design<br />\nand desire to create something<br />\nbeautiful. The quilt makers easily grasp the concept of piecing<br />\ntogether geometric shapes into<br />\npleasing patterns. To this they<br />\nadd a natural sense of color coordination, combining bright and<br />\n<br />\npatterned fabrics. In this exhibit,<br />\nthe viewer can appreciate the different textures of the fabrics as<br />\nwell, from plush velvet to glazed cotton. The beauty of the quilts<br />\nderives from an artistic common<br />\nsense that appeals to everyone.<br />\nOther functional and decorative<br />\nobjects are also fun, such as the<br />\nwhirligigs. It's like being a kid<br />\nagain\u2014turning the propeller and<br />\nsetting the figures in motion. One<br />\nthat has a humorous theme is titl-<br />\n<br />\nCoyote\" exemplifies this. It was<br />\ncarved out of a single piece of<br />\nwood and stands about 2 to 3 feet<br />\ntall. The coyote's position was<br />\nchosen to enhance the natural line<br />\nof the wood. The artist comes<br />\nfrom an artistic movement in the<br />\nSouthwest known as the Santa Fe<br />\nschool.<br />\nAll of the works in the exhibit<br />\nare meant to be experienced tactually which enhances the appreciation of the works.

As the propeller turns, the<br />\nwoman sets her cobbler husband<br />\nto work. The whirligig combines<br />\nthe technology of articulated dolls<br />\n(dolls with movable parts) and<br />\nwindmills.<br />\nNot all of the works on display<br />\nserve a function, they are solely<br />\nfor decoration. The \"Seated<br />\n<br />\nitem was chosen with this idea in<br />\nmind. From the rough clay<br />\nfeatures of the grotesque jug to<br />\nthe wooly tendrils of the Shaker<br />\nrug, each object can be viewed<br />\nmore fully within the added sense<br />\nof touch allowed to come into<br />\nplay.<br />\nTo make the exhibit as accessible as possible to the public, the<br />\ndisplay of the works of art was<br />\n<br />\nplanned to accomodate special<br />\nneeds. For those who are color<br />\nblind or have limited depth vision, all surfaces and objects<br />\nclosest to them contrast tin color. Large, high-contrast<br />\nphotographs of objects are provided for vision-impaired viewers<br />\nso that they may have a close look<br />\nat the entire object. Labels are in<br />\nlarge print and Braille.<br />\nWheelchair users are provided<br />\nwith large aisles that can fit two<br />\nside by side and low, easily<br />\navailable tables with displayed<br />\nobjects. Also, Sound Alive<br />\nwalkmen are. available free to<br />\nguide viewers through the entire<br />\nexhibit. The museum asks that<br />\nviewers wipe their hands before<br />\nhandling the objects.<br />\n\"Access to Art: Bringing Folk<br />\nArt Closer\" definitely achieves<br />\nits purpose in this exhibit. Objects<br />\nof both historical and contemporary significance are presented<br />\nto be fully appreciated by viewers<br />\nboth visually and tactually.

Professor Stewart Hulse, chairman of<br />\nthe Department of Psychology,<br />\nexplains: \"When dealing with the<br />\nidea of morality. . . you are really leaving the world of science<br />\nand going into the world of<br />\nphilosophy. . .science really does<br />\nnot have much to say about those<br />\nkinds of issues.\"<br />\nScientists believe the issue is<br />\nnot one of animal rights but one<br />\nof animal and human welfare,<br />\nwhich is dependent on continued<br />\nmedical and scientific progress.<br />\nRather than question whether<br />\nman can rightfully use animals<br />\nagainst their own individual in-<br />\n<br />\nterest, scientists ask whether man<br />\nhas the right not to use animals.<br />\nIf animals possess certain<br />\nrights, how does one weigh the<br />\ninterest of a rat to those inflicted<br />\nwith cancer, Parkinson's disease,<br />\nAlzheimers disease, heart<br />\ndisease, AIDS, and other<br />\n<br />\nThe fact that alternatives exist does not<br />\nmean that scientists<br />\nwill quit using animals.<br />\ncountless diseases and disorders?<br />\nCan one justify the use of animals<br />\nwhen the life of a human is in<br />\nquestion? These are some of the<br />\nquestions the issue presents to<br />\nscientists.<br />\nAlternatives to animal use are<br />\na major focus of animal rights activists. If other methods are<br />\navailable, they argue, then why<br />\nare animals still being exploited?<br />\nUse of these alternative techni-<br />\n<br />\nques would result in the reduction<br />\nof the number of animals used.<br />\nSpecifically, replacement of<br />\ncomputer/<br />\nwith<br />\nanimals<br />\nmathematical analysis and tissue<br />\ncultures has received considerable<br />\nsupport from these groups.<br />\nMany scientists feel uneasy<br />\nabout using artificial models for<br />\ntheir research, and computer<br />\nsimulation in particular. When<br />\npossible, however, some scientists are able to avoid the use of<br />\nanimals by resorting to other<br />\nmeans.<br />\nAnimals are expensive to maintain and purchase, which acts as<br />\na concrete incentive to use them<br />\nonly when absolutely necessary.<br />\nThe fact that alternatives exist<br />\ndoes not mean that scientists will<br />\nquit using animals for<br />\nexperiments.<br />\nHulse explained that \"In<br />\npsychology, when studying<br />\nanimals' behavior, it's impossible to study the behavior of<br />\nanimals unless studying the<br />\nanimal itself.\"<br />\n<br />\niFrom Warped Minds...<br />\n<br />\nby Cristian Tampe<br />\n<br />\nC,<br />\n<br />\nC.)<br />\n<br />\nThe moral issue presented by<br />\nthe animal rights movement is<br />\nbased on the idea that all forms<br />\nof animal life are equal. Thus,<br />\nthey argue, animals have the<br />\nsame rights as man. If human<br />\nrights are recognized and enforced under law, the rights of<br />\nanimals should be as well. Hone<br />\nbelieves that all forms of life<br />\npossessing a \"moral\" sense or<br />\nsome other attribute of man can<br />\nhave rights, then animals cannot<br />\nhave rights.

Other groups are also<br />\nworking on methods for making<br />\nsynthetic Vitamin D. When asked about the difference between<br />\nwhat his group is doing and the<br />\nother groups, Posner replied,<br />\n\"There are about a dozen groups<br />\naround the world (doing this type<br />\nof reserach) seven to eight in<br />\npharmaceutical companies and<br />\nmaybe two to four in the<br />\nacademic environment.

Hopkins<br />\nentered a men's open eight and<br />\na men's open four boat in the<br />\nregatta which featured a number<br />\nof strong crews from the<br />\nWashington, D.C. area. Unfortunately, there was a technical<br />\ndifficulty with the clock, and the<br />\nresults have not been released.<br />\nLike virtually all the races in<br />\nwhich the team competes during<br />\nthe fall season, the Head of the<br />\nPotomac Regatta was what is<br />\nknown as the \"head race.\" In this<br />\nracing format, the crews, which<br />\nare released in ten to fifteen second intervals from the starting<br />\nline, covering the three mile race<br />\ndistance in the least amount of<br />\ntime. Thus, in the head races dur-<br />\n<br />\ning the fall season, it is more a<br />\nrace against the clock than a race<br />\nagainst other crews.<br />\nIn the Head of the Potomac<br />\nRegatta, Hopkins competed<br />\nagainst a particularly strong field<br />\nthat, among others, included top<br />\nheavyweight boats from perennial<br />\npowers Navy and Georgetown, as<br />\nwell as boats from George<br />\nWashington, William and Mary,<br />\nand the Potomac Rowing Club.<br />\nHopkins'- senior captain, Rob<br />\nPorcarelli, was pleased with the<br />\nteam's effort.<br />\n\"I felt it went really well for<br />\nus.

The regatta will be<br />\nHopkins' only home race of the<br />\nfall season.<br />\n\"We're really looking forward<br />\nto this race because it's our only<br />\nhome race this fall.

Stopping<br />\nBonds and Bonilla are important for the Reds pitchers, but<br />\nthey cannot forget the rest of<br />\nthe Pirate lineup.<br />\nThe Reds offensive lineup is<br />\namidst several injuries, including one to star outfielder<br />\nEric Davis, who is expected to<br />\nplay in the series anyway, and<br />\nto newly acquired second<br />\nbaseman Bill Doran. This will<br />\nput the burden on rookie first<br />\nbaseman Hal Morris, who has<br />\ncarried much of the slack for<br />\nthe Reds since the All-Star<br />\nbreak, and all-star Mariano<br />\nDuncan.<br />\nThese are not the days of the<br />\nPirates of old when the chants<br />\nof \"We are Family,\" rang<br />\nthrough Three Rivers Stadium<br />\nin the late 70's, but the result<br />\nwill be the same. However, the<br />\nReds will not allow their<br />\nawesome start to be forgotten.<br />\nThe Pirates will take this series<br />\n<br />\ntour games to three, and the<br />\nkey will be not in the Pirates'<br />\nyoung tandem, but rather in<br />\nthe depth of the rest of their<br />\nstarting lineup. Pittsburgh,<br />\nthough will have to get a win<br />\nout of someone other than<br />\nDrabek.<br />\n\u2014Defending World Series<br />\nchampion Oakland A's are<br />\ncoming off their third consecutive American League<br />\nWest title. The 1990 AL East<br />\nchampion Boston Red Sox are<br />\nnot the same Sox who lost<br />\nunceremoniously to the Mets<br />\nin the 1986 World Series, but<br />\nthese are definitely the same<br />\nA's who have dominated play<br />\nthe past three seasons and had<br />\nthe best record in baseball this<br />\nseason.<br />\nIn head to head play, the A's<br />\ndefeated the Red Sox eight out<br />\nof twelve times this season.<br />\nThe Sox, though, will look to<br />\nput that record behind them as<br />\nthe series begins. Their hopes<br />\nrest on pitcher Roger Clemens.<br />\nBoston, which led their division by 6 1/2 games on<br />\nSeptember 4, proceeded to<br />\ndrop 15 of 22 games and ended up even with the Toronto<br />\nBlue Jays while Clemens was<br />\nsidelined with a shoulder injury. \"Rocket\" is the key to<br />\nboosting the team's frail confidence. Looking beyond<br />\nClemens, only a much improved Mike Boddicker (16-8) has<br />\nany chance of silencing the<br />\nsolid A's lineup.<br />\nThe starting rotation for the<br />\nA's consists of Bob Welch<br />\n(26-6 and probable AL Cy<br />\nYoung Award winner), Dave<br />\nStewart (22-10) and Scott<br />\nSanderson (17-11). The<br />\nOakland front office has refused to sit on its present talent<br />\nand has done its part to acquire<br />\nnew faces. NL batting chainpion Willie McGee (.335 BA)<br />\nwas obtained recently from the<br />\nSt. Louis Cardinals. McGee<br />\nadds a new dimension to the<br />\nteam, bringing with him speed<br />\n<br />\nas well as a high batting average. The team also<br />\nadded DH Harold Baines.<br />\nThe Red Sox have their own<br />\noffensive power. Their big<br />\nthree: Wade Boggs(.304 BA),<br />\nEllis Burks (.295 BA), and<br />\nMike Greenwell (.297 BA)<br />\nhave been hot of late and led<br />\nBoston to the top AL team batting average. However, in<br />\norder to overcome the top<br />\nrated pitching staff in baseball,<br />\nthey will need some help from<br />\nthe likes of Jody Reed and<br />\nTom Brunansky.<br />\nBarring another earthquake,<br />\nit seems like the only thing<br />\nwhich can overcome the A's<br />\nare their million dollar contracts and the million dollar<br />\negos which have come along<br />\nwith them. They have more<br />\ntalent than any other team in<br />\nbaseball today, possibly even<br />\nin baseball history. The stars<br />\nare the same as last year. Mark<br />\nMcGwire, Jose Canseco, the<br />\nHendersons (Rickey and<br />\nDave), Stewart, and Dennis<br />\nEckersley will all make their<br />\npresences felt in the series.<br />\nRickey Henderson was Mr.<br />\nEverything in the regular<br />\nseason for the A's. Look for<br />\nhim to decide whether the A's<br />\nwill dominate the series or not.<br />\nThe key for the Sox will<br />\ncome in Game 1 on Saturday<br />\nwhen Clemens should square<br />\noff against Welch. The Red<br />\nSox must win this game in<br />\norder to have any hopes of<br />\npulling off the upset. A Red<br />\nSox victory, however, is<br />\nunlikely, unless the ghost from<br />\nthe underdog LA Dodger team<br />\nwhich upset the A's in the<br />\n1988 World Series manages to<br />\nreappear with the Red Sox.<br />\nKnowing Boston's knack for<br />\nlosing big games, look for<br />\nOakland to win the series four<br />\ngames to two. However, if<br />\nClemens' shoulder is healed<br />\nand he can take the mound<br />\nmore than twice, then look for<br />\nthe series to be closer.<br />\n<br />\nIMPORTANT MEETING<br />\nFOR JIM<br />\nUNDERGRADS<br />\nwho want to know more about<br />\n<br />\nPUBLIC HEALTH<br />\nas a career option<br />\n$100 off 18K;$50 off 14K;$25 off 10K<br />\n<br />\nOrder your college ring NOW.<br />\nC.

I'm ambitious and I have<br />\nexperience from being class president<br />\nmy junior and senior years in high<br />\nschool. Currently, there are two major<br />\nproblems that concern me. Crime has<br />\nrisen in Charles Village, making campus<br />\nlife less secure. I'd like to start raising<br />\nmoney to fund more street lights and<br />\npetition city council to match our fundraising dollars. Next, J.H.U. has taken<br />\nsteps to start recycling, but more needs<br />\nto be done. Paper recycling needs to he<br />\nfully implemented\u2014we could recycle 3<br />\ntons more garbage weekly! These projects and others can be done\u2014I'm the<br />\ncandidate who will do it!<br />\n<br />\nAneesh Paul Chopra<br />\nMy candidacy for the office of class<br />\npresident is based on improving student<br />\nlife on campus. One of the benefits of<br />\ngoing to a prestigious university, such<br />\nas Hopkins, is the exposure to unique<br />\ntalents among the student body. In our<br />\nclass, we have outstanding musicians,<br />\nathletes, and even a Devil's stick performer. his my intention to bring out<br />\nthese talents for others to experience.<br />\nWe must take advantage of the gifts we<br />\nhave and expand the scopes of our<br />\nhorizons. Many of us are preprofessional, and that's fine, but what we must<br />\ndo is augment our lives by participating<br />\nin unique activities. Have you ever experienced rock-climbing? Have you ever<br />\ntried to play a musical instrument? The<br />\nClass of '94 has much to offer, and as<br />\npresident, I intend to bring It all forward.<br />\nThank you.<br />\n<br />\nNoel Corcoran<br />\n<br />\nJay Bhama<br />\n<br />\nGood afternoon, my name is Noel P.<br />\nCorcoran. I am running for Freshman<br />\nClass President primarily because I<br />\nwould like to participate in activities and<br />\nstudent government, as I did in high<br />\nschool. These include my being a<br />\nmember of our local Church Youth<br />\nGroup, a member of Students Against<br />\nDrunk Drivers, and a member of the<br />\nCalifornia Scholarship Federation/Honor Society for all four years of<br />\nhigh school. In my sophomore year I was<br />\nClass Vice-Preskdent. In my junior year<br />\nI voluntarily tutored an adult student in<br />\nbasic geometry.<br />\nI also participated in athletics, as a<br />\nmember of the basketball team for two<br />\nyears, and as a member of the tennis<br />\nteam for four years. Despite my participation in all of these activities, I still<br />\nclass<br />\ngraduate<br />\nto<br />\nmanaged<br />\nValedictorian.<br />\nFinally, I'd like to think my peers encouraged me to seek this office, and I'm<br />\nglad to have their support. I greatly look<br />\nforward to the opportunity to have a role<br />\nIn student government if I should be<br />\nelected.<br />\n<br />\nIt seems painfully obvious that this<br />\nschool needs a president whose goal<br />\nisn't simply to get into medical school!<br />\nA president should be concerned, not<br />\nwith what he wants, but rather with what<br />\nthe people in the community want but<br />\naren't capable of attaining as individuals. In a community composed of<br />\nstudents of such caliber as Johns<br />\nHopkins, a president shouldn't believe<br />\nthat his job consists of improving<br />\ncafeteria food, or maintaining the status<br />\nquo. Such should be left to the responsibility of the students. The president of<br />\nsuch a community should be more concerned with matters that require<br />\norganized action by the whole community. As the president, this will be my<br />\ngoal\u2014to allow the Class of 1994 to be<br />\nan organized and powerful voice in the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Community.<br />\n<br />\nSamuel King<br />\nMy name is Sam King, and I am running for Freshman Class President. I'm<br />\nnot doing this for my resume, nor am I<br />\ndoing it for popularity. Rather, I am running because it is the job of the President to communicate the needs of the<br />\nFreshman Class to the administration.<br />\nAs a participant in Hopkins' renowned<br />\nWriting Seminars program, I can appreciate the importance of effective communicative skills; as a former public<br />\nspeaking national champion, I feel I<br />\nhave proven myself as a communicator.<br />\nBelieve that a vote for me is a vote for<br />\nyour best representative in Council.<br />\n<br />\nOluseyi Adebimpe<br />\nHello. I am Oluseyi Adebimpe, a<br />\nfreshman majoring in Chemistry/Writing<br />\nSeminars, graduated from Shady Side<br />\nAcademy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<br />\nI realize that a President presides over<br />\nclass meetings, activities, represents the<br />\nclass at council and directs the other<br />\nofficers.<br />\nMy experiences working with people<br />\ninduct editing for the school<br />\nnewspaper, volunteering at various<br />\nhospitals and pitching for the baseball<br />\nteam.<br />\nAs President I hope to direct dances,<br />\nlip sync contest, Wednesday Night Live,<br />\nFreshman Outing Day and sales (e.g.<br />\ndonuts/blowpop) that benefit our class<br />\ntreasury as well as the community's less<br />\nfortunate people.<br />\n<br />\nKhris Kline<br />\nThe Freshman class needs leadership,<br />\nit needs direction, and most of all it<br />\nneeds better food. The job of the president is to provide for these things. I may<br />\nnot change the food situation. but I will<br />\ntry to provide a direction and unity<br />\nwithin the class. I'm not going to make<br />\nhuge campaign promise that sound<br />\ngreat but no one expects me to keep and<br />\nI probably wouldn't, but I will say that<br />\nI plan to be a visible and active voice for<br />\nthe Class of 1994. I will try to address<br />\nand solve problems within the school<br />\nand make sure class festivities are frequent and overflowing.<br />\n<br />\n-Secretary<br />\nJane Sumergrade<br />\nThe Class of'94 needs YOU to get involved. If elected as YOUR Class<br />\nSecretary, I hope to improve student<br />\nawareness about the various activities<br />\nthat occur at Hopkins. In addition, YOU<br />\nas a student must show support for<br />\nYOUR school whether it is involvement<br />\nin clubs, internships, or sports. YOU are<br />\nsurrounded by opportunities to meet<br />\npeople from all over the world. It is<br />\nbecause the student body is so diverse,<br />\nthat social activities will appeal to<br />\neveryone. As Class Secretary, I would<br />\nhope to facilitate the process by listening to YOUR suggestions and actually<br />\npulling through for YOU, my<br />\nclassmates. As Secretary, I hope to be<br />\nresponsive to YOUR interests and needs<br />\nin making YOUR Hopkins experience<br />\nworthwhile.<br />\n<br />\nI. Renee S. Coulter, of The Johns<br />\nHopkins University Class of 1994 do<br />\nhereby declare myself to be a candidate<br />\nfor freshman class secretary.<br />\nThroughout my life, two ideals have<br />\nallowed me to excel while capturing the<br />\nessence of life. Diligence continually<br />\nteaches me to strive and reach a goal no<br />\nmatter what the hardships or costs are.<br />\nAlso important to me is to seize the attainable opportunities in life and with<br />\nredoubled force, return to them my own<br />\nefforts. As freshman class secretary, I<br />\nwould apply both qualities, along with<br />\nselflessness, to be as productive and efficient as possible.<br />\n<br />\nThat's right. . . you can<br />\nhave free soda every day for<br />\nthe rest of your life.

The obvious impact of issues such<br />\nas revising the Academic Advising Committee and the renovations of certain<br />\nbuildings on campus is precisely why the<br />\nneed for strong ideas and skilled leadership is so great. I have a knowledge of<br />\nboth of these through various activities<br />\nIn high school, including three years of<br />\nbeing president of my class. I hope to<br />\nbe able to employ this experience as<br />\nyour president.<br />\n<br />\nNewspapers<br />\nFilm Developing<br />\n<br />\nRepresentative<br />\nSarah Appleman<br />\nAs a new student at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nI hope to learn as much as possible<br />\nabout the University environment, as<br />\nwell as become an active member in the<br />\ncommunity. Being a class representative<br />\nfor Student Council will give me the opportunity to become as involved as I<br />\nhope to, while getting to know other<br />\nJohns Hopkins students.

I enjoy representing and working with people, and I believe my plethora of zany<br />\nideas will be an asset to Johns Hopkins'<br />\nneed for a more collegiate image.<br />\nGranted, I am only a freshman and am<br />\nalmost clueless on how things operate<br />\naround here, but there is one thing I<br />\nknow: This school needs to get rid of its<br />\nCut Throat Nerdy image. This school<br />\nneeds some tradition, besides the<br />\nLacrosse team, and through effective,<br />\nimaginative planning, we can create at<br />\nHopkins a more rich and spiritful college<br />\nenvironment. As President of the<br />\nFreshman Class I will also gain the experience and insight needed to lead at<br />\nhigher levels of the Student Council in<br />\nthe future.<br />\n<br />\nTreasurer<br />\nTamara Charm<br />\nHi! My name is Tamara Charm, and<br />\nI am running for Class Treasurer. I live<br />\nin Griffin House of AMR II. I'm really<br />\nexcited for our freshman year at<br />\nHopkins and want to do everything I can<br />\nto make sure that it is the best year it<br />\ncan be.<br />\nAs a class officer, I think that I could<br />\ncontribute to class unity. I think that on<br />\na campus like ours, where many<br />\nstudents move off campus after<br />\nfreshman year, a strong student government can help to keep each class<br />\ntogether.<br />\nAs far as fundraising goes, there are<br />\nmany fun and profitable events that we<br />\ncould hold. One idea is a candy-gram<br />\nsale for Valentines Day.<br />\nI have had experience in the position<br />\nof treasurer, for four years of high<br />\nschool club, as well as leadership positions in many other organizations including two years as president of my<br />\nlocal youth group.<br />\n<br />\nPeter Michael<br />\nFeldman<br />\n<br />\nRenee S.

Entering as freshmen,<br />\nour class has relatively no unity and absolutely no capital. It would be my main<br />\ngoal as Treasurer of the Class of 1994,<br />\nto both unify the student body and to<br />\nearn money. I have very easy access to<br />\na company that will supply us with the<br />\nmerchandise for fundraising, all I will<br />\nneed is your support.

Everyone comes<br />\nfrom a different place, but for the next<br />\nfour years, we're all going to be<br />\ntogether. Our class can do many things<br />\ntogether, and it is up to us to decide. As<br />\ntreasurer, I hope to help set up class ac-<br />\n<br />\ntivities, like beach cookouts, that<br />\neveryone will enjoy. In representing our<br />\nclass on the Student Activities Commission, I will work hard to make sure our<br />\nclass receives the money it needs. There<br />\nis so much we can do here, and I would<br />\nlike to be a part of making this a great<br />\nyear for all of us.<br />\n<br />\nAnna Morgan<br />\nBeing treasurer is not as easy as it<br />\nmay seem. Not only does a treasurer<br />\nmanage money, but he/she also comes<br />\nup with ideas on how to raise that<br />\nmoney, and puts them to work. So what<br />\nmakes me, Anna Morgan,the best candidate for the job? First, I am disciplined and dedicated to my responsibilities.<br />\nThis is exemplified in my involvement as<br />\na member of the Hopkins crew team,<br />\nthat demands a lot of time and energy.<br />\nAlso, last year, as a representative of my<br />\nclass, I channeled ideas and information<br />\nbetween students, thus helping to unite<br />\nthe senior class. This year, I will make<br />\nmyself open to any suggestions or complaints you may have. And I will initiate<br />\nand budget those activities for which<br />\nthere is a general consensus. So<br />\nremember, when you vote, chose the<br />\ncandidate that will work for you in realizing your hopes for the Class of 1994. In<br />\nother words, vote Anna Morgan for<br />\ntreasurer.<br />\n<br />\nReid Orth<br />\nWithout wise leadership, a nation (college) is in trouble; but without good<br />\ncounseling there is safety.<br />\nProverbs 11:14<br />\nIn just weeks, we've restructured our<br />\nfriendships, habits, and tolerance of<br />\nfood.

With officer experience in my class and three clubs, I<br />\nmade a crucial decision\u2014attending<br />\nHopkins after receiving AF Academy<br />\nand West Point appointments.

Therefore, my<br />\ndoor, phone line, and ears will always<br />\nbe open to all members of the freshmen<br />\nclass with any type of suggestion or<br />\ncomplaint. I want everyone in our class<br />\nto live in as comfortable an atmosphere<br />\nas possible.

I believe<br />\nin getting involved both in and out of the<br />\nuniversity as exemplified by my running<br />\nfor representative as well as my unsolicited volunteering at a local nursing<br />\nhome. By being elected representative,<br />\nI will take the challenges fo the students<br />\nto the deans and faculty, therefore<br />\nminimizing the gap between the power<br />\nof the faculty and the free and honest<br />\nopinions of the students. Through<br />\ndedication, desire and plenty of<br />\ndiscipline, I will bring success to the<br />\nstudents and more importantly, my<br />\nfriends, of Johns Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nMy goal is this:<br />\nIf Hopkins was your first choice, I<br />\nwant to assure you that it was.<br />\nIf Hopkins was not, I want to make<br />\nyou glad that your other schools rejected<br />\nyou!<br />\n<br />\nDerek Strong<br />\nMy name is Derek Strong. I'm from<br />\nSan Francisco, California. As Vice<br />\nPresident, I will encourage students to<br />\nbe aware of all the opportunities<br />\navailable to them. I will put students in<br />\ntouch with groups, services, and other<br />\nstudents who share common interest,<br />\nand I will always be available to help someone with a question or concern. I will<br />\ntake these issues to the student council,<br />\nand if there is something that I can do,<br />\nI will not hesitate to get it done. My first<br />\npriority will always be the Class of 1994.<br />\n<br />\nStudent government serves not only<br />\nas a sounding board for students' opinions and concerns but even more,it can<br />\nbe considered a \"vehicle\" through which<br />\nchange is proposed, considered, and actually made. As freshmen, we represent<br />\na new class of students who possess the<br />\nstrength, talent, and spirit that many<br />\nother student bodies lack. Therefore. it<br />\nis necessary that we capitalize on our enthusiasm and elect a student government that will change Hopkins for the<br />\nbetter and make the administration<br />\nlisten to our undergraduate needs.<br />\nAs leaders, we must be able to take<br />\nour ideas and carry them forward with<br />\npassion and vigor so that we may make<br />\na lasting impression on Hopkins. It is<br />\nwith this in mind, as well as the aim of<br />\nproducing more strong and active<br />\ngovernment that I intend to contribute<br />\nmy energy, ideas and dedication to the<br />\nposition of freshman representative.<br />\n<br />\nTejas Mehta<br />\nThe desire to create change is a fundamental characteristic of each of us<br />\nhere at Hopkins. It is for this reason that<br />\nI have chosen to run for Freshman<br />\nRepresentative. I believe I can represent<br />\nthe Freshman class strongly in council<br />\nmeetings and work its goals to most<br />\nbenefit the Class of 1994. Our class is<br />\none of the largest to enter Johns<br />\nHopkins. As a result, representing such<br />\na class requires great responsibility and<br />\ndedication: two qualities I hope to exhibit to you. Therefore, I would be greatly honored to be your class rep, and I<br />\nlook forward to working with you.<br />\n<br />\nVishal Nigam<br />\nMelanie Hanger<br />\nHi, my name is Melanie Hanger and<br />\nI am running for the office of class<br />\nrepresentative. I live in Gildersleeve, the<br />\ncenter house of AMR II, in the room<br />\nright above the main entrance. This position puts me in the center of our<br />\nfreshman class geographically. As your<br />\nrepresentative, I hope to be in the center<br />\nof our class activities and events. I am<br />\nrunning for this office because I think I<br />\ncan help the Class of 1994 make a permanent mark at JHU.<br />\nIn high school, I had experience both<br />\nas a class representative and as a<br />\nmember of various school and class<br />\ncommittees. I think the most important<br />\nqualification of this position, however is<br />\nenthusiasm and a willingness to speak<br />\nout. In this area, I definitely qualify. I<br />\nhave no problem talking as much as<br />\nnecessary to get my point across, so if<br />\nyou want to be heard, \"VOTE FOR<br />\nMEL!\"<br />\n<br />\nMy major motivation for wanting to be a freshman representative is<br />\nI have several ideas on how to make life<br />\nbetter here. In addition, I believe that I<br />\nhave the character needed to accomplish<br />\nthese goals and to be an effective<br />\nrepresentative\u2014in that I am energetic,<br />\nopen-minded, and not afraid to take<br />\nchallenging stands. I think that the student body needs to have more school<br />\nspirit, to change the way that professors<br />\nare evaluated, and to revive the honor<br />\ncode. In order to increase the sense of<br />\ncommunity at this university, I would try<br />\nto increase the number of activities involving the entire student body. In the<br />\ncase of professor evaluations, professors should be appraised on their<br />\nmerit as teachers, as well as researchers,<br />\nInstead of the current system of evaluations based mainly upon their merit as<br />\nresearchers. Most importantly, I feel<br />\nthat a honor code based upon the integrity of the student is a necessity in a<br />\ninstitute of higher learning. I realize<br />\nthese changes may be difficult to<br />\nachieve; however I feel that they must be<br />\nvigorously pursued.<br />\n<br />\nDipak Panigrahi<br />\n<br />\nGreg Goodell<br />\n<br />\nThe duties and responsibilities of a<br />\ncouncil representative are something<br />\nthat all candidates must decide for<br />\nthemselves. As I see it, a community<br />\ncouncil representative is just that: a<br />\nrepresentative. My duty is not to decide<br />\nwhat I feel is correct or valid, but rather<br />\nto voice the opinions of the class as a<br />\nwhole. In a class as large as ours, containing approximately 860 individuals,<br />\nthis would appear to be quite a large<br />\ntask. Therefore, as a representative. I<br />\nam determined to be someone who is<br />\nboth easy to approach and talk to. It is<br />\nin this way that I feel I will be better able<br />\nto represent the interests of our entire<br />\nfreshman class.<br />\n<br />\nThe coming years at Johns Hopkins<br />\nwill be filled with new and exciting<br />\nevents. It is a new era for our university. As class representative I will work for<br />\nthe class and the achievement of our<br />\ngoals during these years of change. I will<br />\nwork to bring our class together, make<br />\nour views known to the university, and<br />\nwork to bring more activities to our campus. As president of my high school<br />\nclass, I gained the knowledge and experience needed to represent students<br />\nand their views. I want to use that<br />\nknowledge to serve the Class of 1994.<br />\n<br />\nBrad Holmberg<br />\nThe position of class representative<br />\nnot only entails communicating with the<br />\nstudent body, but acting from the information received. I want to interact with<br />\nthe students, faculty, and administration<br />\nto accomplish several goals tht will<br />\nbenefit our class. By increasing the total<br />\ninput of students we can pinpoint certain aspects of JHU that need improvement. These improvements will arise in<br />\nsocial, economic, and academic areas.<br />\nIdeas include a more diverse array of<br />\nentertainment, less expensive and higher<br />\nquality laundry facilities, and the encouragement of faculty-student and<br />\nstudent-student relations. As a united<br />\nclass we can make these years prosperous and unforgettable.<br />\n<br />\nBrandon Rotbart<br />\n<br />\nSteven Starr<br />\nI, Steven Starr, would like to announce my candidacy for Freshman<br />\nClass Vice President.

I<br />\nam a capable and responsible individual<br />\nwho will commit fully to my position if<br />\nelected. In the past three weeks, I have<br />\nbeen introduced to an incredible class<br />\nthat includes a range of many bright,<br />\nunique, and talented individuals. During<br />\nthe week of orientation the members of<br />\nthe freshman class were introduced to<br />\none another and now it is time that they<br />\nbecome unified under the guidance of<br />\ntheir future representatives and introduced to the Hopkins community. At<br />\nthis moment my class is scattered and<br />\nnot well-known, therefore I would like<br />\nto help inform them of what Hopkins is<br />\nall about and bring them together as our<br />\nfirst year here progresses forward.<br />\n<br />\nRoyce Poinsett<br />\nOne thing we can and must improve<br />\nabout Hopkins is ENTERTAINMENT.<br />\nFocusing on academic excellence,<br />\nHopkins has always left its Entertainment Committee severely underfunded:<br />\nJHU $10,000/yr, George Mason<br />\n$200,000/yr. The Student Council has<br />\ngot to immediately refocus its limited<br />\nenergies and funds into creating what<br />\nthis university needs: life after the library<br />\ncloses. The administration can and will<br />\nhandle the rest, anyway. Hopkins<br />\ndoesn't have to stay the way it is. We'll<br />\nhave quality entertainment(bigger parties, bands you've heard of, etc.) with<br />\nmotivated, knowledgable leadership and<br />\nMORE FUNDING.

Private and<br />\npublic colleges and universities<br />\nall across the country have been<br />\nrestructuring their programs over<br />\nthe past decades to include a<br />\nhigher percentage of women professors, and Hopkins has recently begun its own effort to mediate<br />\nthe discrepancy between the male<br />\nto female ratio in faculty and administrative positions.<br />\nDr. Catharine Evans, the head<br />\nof the Women's Forum and<br />\nmember of the Provost Committee on the Status of Women, said<br />\nabout the issue of gender equity<br /><br />\nLoren Rieth<br /><br />\nDr. Catherine Evans is a member of the Provost Committee on the<br />\nStatus of Women.<br /><br />\nat Hopkins, \"We're way behind<br />\nother schools.\"<br />\nWhile there have been some<br />\nvery encouraging increases in<br />\nspecific departments, overall progress in the effort to hire more<br />\nwomen has been slow. Between<br />\n1979 and 1988, the number Of<br />\nwomen professors in the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences has risen<br />\nfrom five to seven percent of the<br />\ntotal. The number of associate<br />\nand assistant professors have increased by eleven percent; instructors by seventeen percent;<br />\nand lecturers by twenty one percent. Dr. Evans said that a surprisingly low number of women<br />\nhold top-rank positions in their<br />\ntenured<br />\nas<br />\ndepartments<br />\nprofessors.<br />\nDr. Evans believes that fewer<br />\nwomen accept positions at<br />\nHopkins because, \"the climate of<br />\nthe school is not very hospitable<br />\nto women.\" Women are not wellrepresented at Hopkins and that<br />\ncan oftentimes deter a woman<br />\nfrom applying for and accepting<br />\na position with the University,<br />\nshe said. The Women's Forum<br />\nhas been trying to reverse this<br />\nsituation, but up until now the<br />\ntwo-year-old organization of500<br />\nwomen had not received much<br />\nsupport from the University.<br />\nDr. Ashby pointed out that it<br />\nis difficult for women to be the<br />\nminority at Hopkins because they<br /><br />\nHopkins Tuition Costs Examined<br />\n'Survey Shows Hopkins as Number Nineteen'<br />\nby Li-Yu Huang<br />\nDespite the steady $1000 increase of tuition each year, and<br />\nthe results of a recent USA Today poll, overall costs of attending Johns Hopkins University is<br />\ncomparable to those costs for<br />\neducation at other private institutions, according to administration<br />\nofficials.<br />\nUSA Today reports Hopkins as<br />\nthe eighth most expensive U.S.<br />\ncollege, with tuition, room and<br />\nboard expenses totaling $20,950<br />\nfor the 1990-91 school year. On<br />\nthe College Board survey,<br />\nhowever, Hopkins does not even<br />\nreach the top ten when examining tuition and fees alone, with<br />\nthe cost reported at $15,380 for<br />\n1990-91.<br />\n\"The actual College Board<br /><br />\nsurvey of college tuition and fees<br />\nshows Hopkins as number nineteen,\" Executive Director of<br />\nAcademic Services Bob Massa<br />\nsaid. \"The figures USA Today<br />\nused are weighted figures. The<br />\nCollege Board ranks in two<br />\nways\u2014unweighted, which is the<br />\nactual tuition and fees charge,<br />\nwhich is actually the way to do<br />\nit because that's what you are<br />\npaying from your pocket\u2014and<br />\nweighted.

Though the ROTC<br />\nprogram at Hopkins offers classes<br />\nthrough the Department of<br />\nMilitary Science in which anyone<br />\nmay enroll, DOD regulations forbid the admission of gays or lesbians into the ROTC proper<br />\nwhich administrators all ROTC<br />\nscholarship money.<br />\nThe DOD policy became official in 1982 and has been consistently upheld as constitutional<br />\nby federal courts.

As<br />\nwas often the case, both of the<br />\ndoors to apartment 311 were<br />\nlocked. This didn't necessarily<br />\nmean that nobody was home,<br />\nthough\u2014it meant either that<br />\nnobody was home or that Doris<br />\nwas. Doris had apparantly taken<br />\nall of the horror stories about city life to heart. Miranda often<br />\nwondered if there was some hidden booby trap inside the doorway (easily activated from<br />\nanywhere in the apartment, she<br />\nwas sure)just in case some mad<br />\ndeviant sex pervert murderer had<br />\nfollowed one of her roommates<br />\nhome and stolen her keys (after<br />\nmurdering her, of course). Zack<br />\nplayed upon this time and time<br />\nagain.<br />\n\"Ha ha ha!\" he laughed. \"I've<br />\njust killed Miranda and I'm coming to kill you, Doris! Ha ha ha!\"<br />\nMiranda opened the door.<br />\nDoris was in the kitchen cooking.<br />\nMiranda would stake her life on<br />\nthe fact that, whatever it was she<br />\nwas making, it had oatmeal in it.<br />\n\"Whatcha making?\" Zack<br />\nasked.<br />\n\"Cookies,\" Doris smiled innocently. Miranda didn't buy it.<br />\nShe had to know.<br />\n\"Oatmeal?\" Miranda asked.<br />\n\"You like oatmeal,\" Doris<br />\ninsisted.<br />\n\"I like oatmeal in moderation,<br />\nthank you, Doris.\"<br />\n\"Well, it's good for you.\"<br />\n\"So is moderation.\"<br />\nDoris loved oatmeal. Doris<br />\nloved to cook oatmeal. Doris loved to cook oatmeal into anything<br />\nelse she cooked. Miranda was<br />\nquite certain that Doris had had<br />\nsome sort of intense oatmeal experience in her childhood<br />\ndevelopment that affected her<br />\npresent mental state. Still, Miranda had been rooming with Doris<br />\nsince freshman year, so, while<br />\nshe wasn't quite sick of Doris,<br />\nshe was certainly sick of oatmeal.<br />\n\"Chocolate chip\u2022 is nice,\"<br />\nto<br />\nattempted<br />\nMiranda<br />\n..<br />\ncompromise.<br />\n\"Fine. How's chocolate chip<br /><br />\noatmeal?\"<br />\nIn the three years she had<br />\nknown Doris, she had never won<br />\nan oatmeal argument.

Even Zack wouldn't<br />\neat them.<br />\n\"Great,\" Miranda sighed.<br />\n\"Well, then I'll need some<br />\nchocolate chips.\" Doris put on<br />\nher best innocent little darling<br /><br />\nDoris had had some<br />\nsort of intense<br />\noatmeal experience<br />\nin her childhood<br />\ndevelopment<br /><br />\nBig Laughs on Campus<br />\nThere's an old campus joke: Two inmates are sitting in Baltimore County Jail, exchanging their woes.<br />\nThe first tells of an unsuccessful attempt to steal his<br />\nlandlord's car\u2014standard stuff, the guy caught him and<br />\ncalled the police. The second inmate, however, hedges<br />\nwhen telling the story. He was pulling a burglary, yeah,<br />\nup in the north part of Baltimore. Where? the first guy<br />\nasks. Johns Hopkins, says the second, the University. The first inmate seems impressed for a while; then<br />\nfurrows his brows. Wait a minute, he says, the guards<br />\nup there don't got no guns. I know, says the second<br />\nguy. So how did they get you? the other asks.<br />\nDoughnuts, answers the second, they threw stale<br />\ndoughnuts at me and knocked me unconscious. The<br />\nfirst inmate whistles through his teeth. Man, he says,<br />\nyou don't mess with those guys.<br />\nIt's only one joke of dozens, perhaps hundreds, in<br />\ncirculation about the Johns Hopkins Security force.<br />\nAlthough the punchlines vary, the essence of the<br />\nhumor\u2014that Security is ill-equipped to protect Hopkins<br />\nstudents\u2014is remarkably consistent. It's a serious<br />\nallegation, and one that deserves some scrutiny.<br />\nFirst, it's doubtful that Security's primary role is<br />\nto protect Hopkins students. Consider the territory,<br />\nfirepower, and daily tasks of a Security officer. He<br />\npatrols the campus looking for suspicious characters;<br />\nsupervises campus events; writes parking tickets;<br />\nassists when there are problems in University housing; and unlocks doors for wisecracking<br />\nundergraduates. He carries no gun, tabulates campus<br />\ncrime statistics, and maybe even helps to assemble the<br />\nsecurity bulletins that circulate every so often.<br />\nGlamorous it isn't. But it's what these men\u2014and they<br />\ndo all seem to be men\u2014are hired to do.<br />\nSecond, and consequently, the University seems to<br />\nregard Security less as a force than a presence: It's<br />\nhere to watch over the campus. This includes students,<br />\nfaculty, and staff, of course, but not them exclusively. There are capital investments to protect, buildings<br />\nto patrol, and there is business to conduct\u2014things that<br />\nseem as'important to security as the safety of students.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nAn Expatriate Writes, Wishing Well; Words for a 'Mindless<br />\nCampus Tabloid', In Defense of the Biology Dept.<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIt was encouraging to read in your<br />\nSeptember 21 News-Letter that Dean<br />\nArmstrong is now taking great interest in rebuilding the French Program. In view of his statement that<br />\n\"'wet are not looking to recreate the<br />\nold department, but to build a new<br />\nteam of faculty that will have a<br />\nstronger focus on modern twentieth<br />\ncentury French culture and<br />\nliterature,'\u2022 it might be useful to<br />\nremember that the three remaining<br />\nfaculty members in the French<br />\ndepartment are specialists of the sixteenth (Defaux), seventeenth<br /><br />\nrefused to show it.

At no time did Sean<br />\nmake any racial remarks, he was just<br />\ntrying to do his job.<br />\nThe problem is really with the<br />\nNews-Letter rather than any individual. The News-Letter owes<br /><br />\nitself, the University, and the student<br />\nbody a higher level of professionalism. If you hope to improve<br />\nyour status as a mindless campus<br />\ntabloid, I suggest you start doing<br />\nyour homework.<br />\nDavid Boxenbaum<br /><br />\n(Doueihi), and eighteenth century<br />\nface and beamed at Zack.<br />\n\"Zackie, would you go down to<br />\nPhil's and get me some.<br />\n\"As long as I can hit the<br />\nbathroom first,\" Zack said, walking down the hall to Carol's<br />\nroom. Miranda and Carol had<br />\nmade a deal upon moving into the<br />\napartment: if Miranda took the<br />\nroom without the bathroom,<br />\nCarol would keep a path across<br />\nher floor clean.

Then they both turned<br />\nto see Zack shuffling unhappily<br />\nback down the hallway.<br />\n\"Doris, can I use your<br />\nbathroom?\" he asked dejectedly.<br />\n\"Sure, Zackie,\" Doris smiled<br />\nwistfully.<br />\n\"I think maybe we should go<br />\nwith the boy, Doris,\" Miranda<br />\nsaid as soon as Zack had shut the<br />\ndoor.<br />\n\"Is he still upset about . ..?\"<br />\n\"Dumb as he is, yes.\"<br />\n\"Too bad,\" Doris said. \"Oh,<br />\nContinued on page 6<br /><br />\nBut if this idea proves offensive, don't take it out on<br />\nthe Hop Cops. Write to University President William<br />\nRichardson, or to Head of Security Robert Larkin; they<br />\nalone have the power to change Security's duties.<br />\nIn the meantime, consider the content of all the<br />\nSecurity jokes you have grown to know and admire,<br />\nand then consider the obvious: If these people are as<br />\nincompetent as the jokes portray them, why call them<br />\nin an emergency? These men have no guns to wield,<br />\nshould firepower be necessary. Their response to a call<br />\nfor help can be sluggish. The only arrest they can make<br />\nis a citizen's arrest\u2014something any willing Hopkins<br />\nstudent can accomplish unassisted. In short, if there<br />\nis any problem worth reporting, it is worth reporting<br />\nto the Baltimore Police. They at least have the authority<br />\nand the manpower to solve a problem\u2014whether<br />\njudicial, medical, or custodial\u2014with the greatest speed<br />\nand the least confusion.<br />\nBut don't forget Security entirely. Even though their<br />\nmission may be skimpy, Major Larkin's team still<br />\ncould use considerable improvements. With the help<br />\nof the Dean of Students and other willing administrators, Security should finance and organize an<br />\nongoing series of classes in self-defense\u2014regular<br />\nclasses, not one-time workshops\u2014to instruct members<br />\nof the Hopkins Community. Hopkins' officers should<br />\nwork with the Baltimore Police to circulate accurate<br />\nCharles Village crime statistics on a regular basis. And<br />\ngiven the scope of their turf, Larkin's officers should<br />\nbe vastly more assiduous in circulating through it.<br />\nSure, there are good laughs to be found in the antics of Hopkins Security. But burglary and aggravated<br />\nassault in Charles Village have risen markedly in the<br />\npast six months, as have other types of crime, and a<br />\nHopkins student was the victim of an attempted rape<br />\nonly three weeks ago\u2014in daylight, and just on the edge<br />\nof campus. The News-Letter is all for good jokes,<br />\nespecially when they cut as close to truth as most<br />\nSecurity jokes do.

Our<br />\npremedical students were forced to<br />\ntake the predecessors of this course<br />\nwhen a freshman general biology<br />\ncourse was eliminated about thirty<br />\nyears ago.<br />\nHistorically, the strength of<br />\nHopkins has been to be innovative<br />\nand to concentrate on areas perceived as important for the future. The<br />\nHopkins Department of Biology was<br />\namong the first to recognize that a<br />\nreal understanding of the subject<br />\ncould be obtained only after a<br />\nthorough grounding in chemistry.<br />\nThe present curriculum was<br />\ndeveloped for the benefit of those<br />\nplanning careers in biology.<br />\nPremeds had to adapt. Needless to<br />\nsay this background has proven to be<br />\nexcellent preparation for future<br />\nphysicians.<br />\nAt a time when medical students<br />\nwith traditional backgrounds were<br />\nhaving difficulties with concepts now<br />\ncommon in Introductory Chemistry,<br />\nHopkins graduates were able to<br />\nunderstand much of the current<br />\nresearch. The burgeoning of<br />\nbiochemical applications in medical<br />\npractice is an indication that our<br />\nDepartment of Biology made the<br />\nright decision thirty years ago.

However any<br />\nchanges should be in the direction of<br />\npreparing our students for the<br />\nbiology of the year 2020, not by<br />\nreturning to courses which were out<br />\nof date in 1960.<br />\nI wish Ms. Luzetti had talked to<br />\nme about her plans to become a<br />\nphysicians's assistant. If she entered<br />\nHopkins with this goal, she chose the<br />\nwrong school. If her original goal<br />\nwas medicine, she most probably has<br />\nmade a poor career choice. For<br />\nseveral years Hopkins had a School<br />\nof Allied Health Sciences which<br />\ntrained physician's assistants. lf the<br />\ngraduates of that program are<br />\ntypical, only very special people are<br />\nsatisfied with the limited care they<br />\nare permitted to deliver. Over half<br />\nof the graduates later applied to<br />\nmedical school.<br />\nIt has been my experience that individuals who originally planned a<br />\ncareer as a physician and who do not<br />\ngo to medical school are most happy in their ultimate career choice if<br />\nthey enter fields not too closely allied<br />\nto medicine. One of the duties I have<br />\nas health professions advisor is to<br />\nhelp individuals decide if medicine<br />\nis the right profession for them.<br />\nRarely would the courses your article propose be necessary for individuals who have made changes in<br />\ntheir career goals after entering<br />\nHopkins as premeds.<br />\nJohn W. Gryder<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a graduate student in the<br />\nDepartment of Biology, I would like<br />\nto respond to last week's editorial<br />\nregarding the department's<br />\ncurriculum.<br />\nI do sympathize with students who<br />\nare seeking better preparation in<br />\nhealth related fields. I agree that a<br />\ndemand at Hopkins for such courses<br />\n(.'onnnued on page 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\nLetters<br /><br />\nHILLCREST CLINIC<br />\nPrompt confidential help<br /><br />\nA Young Trustee Returns at Least by Mail<br />\nContinued from page 4<br />\nas anatomy is justified. I must<br />\ndisagree with placing the blame for<br />\nthe lack of such courses entirely on<br />\nthe Department of Biology.<br />\nA good anatomy course need not<br />\nbe taught exclusively by the biology<br />\ndepartment. At MIT, for instance,<br />\nanatomy and physiology courses are<br />\ntaught by the department of Nutrition and Food Science. Here at<br />\nHopkins, one could easily argue that<br />\nthe research of the Department of<br />\nBiophysics is best suited to teaching<br />\nanatomy. Anatomy could also be offered jointly by more than one<br />\ndepartment, perhaps as part of the<br />\nbiomedical engineering program.<br />\nPerhaps the best alternative would be<br />\nto hire a medical school professor to<br />\nteach a course at Hopkins.<br />\nThe Department of Biology must<br />\nprepare students for careers in<br />\nbiology, not just for medical school.<br />\nIn the past two years, the biology<br />\ndepartment has not offered<br />\nmicrobiology, immunology, or<br />\ngeneral biology to undergraduate<br />\nmajors. Such courses would help<br />\nstudents who wish to pursue careers<br />\nin biology. To ignore these needs<br />\nand add health-related classes would<br />\nfurther the existing slant toward premeds in this department.<br />\nBob Lessick<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI recently recieved my copy of the<br />\nSept. 21 edition of the Newsletter in<br />\nwhich I read:<br />\n\"The Johns Hopkins University<br />\ndoes not discriminate on the basis of<br />\nrace, sex, color, religion, homosexuality, nationality or ethnic origin,<br />\nhandicap or veteran status in any student program administered by the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nThis statement is one of the central pillars of what Hopkins stands<br />\nfor. Other pillars include freedom of<br />\nexpression and service to the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe above quote was the start of<br />\nan excellent letter by Paul Del<br />\nGrosso which I feel every student<br />\nand administrator at Hopkins should<br />\nread. Mr. Del Grosso's line of<br />\ndiscussion and reasoning are crystal<br />\nclear and correct. He repeats what<br />\nseveral students, staff, faculty, administrators and hopefully trustees<br />\nall over the country have been saying: ROTC is an exception to the<br />\nabove university principles and<br />\nthat wrong!!<br />\nSo what are Hopkins leader's (including adminstrators and trustees)<br />\noptions?<br />\n(1) Phase out ROTC without hur-<br /><br />\nThe Right Angle<br />\nKevin McCrea<br />\nContrary to some reports,<br />\nconservatives have hearts, too.<br />\nBut conservative displays of<br />\ncompassion do not match those<br />\nof the left in terms of their<br />\n\"generosity.\" Conservatives,<br />\nhowever, realize that the wanton throwing of money at problems fails to provide any<br />\nlong-term solutions to the problems of the country; instead,<br />\nthey remember that such basic<br />\nconcepts as \"incentive\" and<br />\n\"free enterprise\" can and do<br />\nactually work in raising people from squalid living<br />\nconditions.<br />\nConsider the problem of<br />\neither those living in<br />\ngovernment-subsidized housing or those who are homeless.<br />\nYes, a problem does exist:<br />\nthere are tot) many people living in intolerable conditions.<br />\nYet to lay all of the blame for<br />\nthe social ailments of the day<br />\non the shoulders of the Reagan<br />\nand Bush administrations is<br />\nquite naive\u2014remember that<br />\nover a quarter of a century has<br />\npassed since Lyndon Johnson<br />\ninstituted his \"Great Society\"<br />\nreforms.<br />\nThis problem will almost<br />\ncertainly never completely<br />\ndisappear in a country which<br />\nstresses equality of opportunity<br />\nover equality of result. Of<br />\ncourse, the housing problem<br />\nwould be much less in a country which did emphasize the<br />\nlatter. But even I won't accuse<br />\nthe \"dreaded liberal antagonists\" of looking upon the<br />\nSoviet Union as a role model<br /><br />\nBut what should the government do to best combat this<br />\nproblem? Before answering<br />\nthis question, though, past approaches which have failed<br />\nmust be re-examined.<br />\nFirst of all, obviously, the<br />\npre-New Deal, \"classic\" conservative approach of completely ignoring the poor just<br />\ndoes not work.

Face it:<br />\nwelfare does not work. Where<br />\nis the incentive for someone to<br />\nattempt to work his way out of<br />\nthe depths of society when he<br />\ncan recieve free money and<br />\nhousing without having to earn<br />\nthem?

For Hopkins this<br />\nmay seem more difficult considering<br />\nthe level of support which several<br />\naspects of the university receives<br />\nfrom the military/defense sectors.<br />\nBut are our root values and pillars<br />\nfor sale or up for discussion? No,<br />\nthey are not; we should not be flexible when it comes to the core goals<br />\nof this university.<br />\nIf we are to create or maintain a<br />\ntruly remarkable University, we do<br />\nnot only need excellent scholars,<br />\n\"mo money,\" facilities, and<br />\nresearch. It also entails the construction of an environment in which all<br />\npersons at Hopkins' institutions<br />\nrespect and promote individuality<br />\nand diversity. It requires that all of<br />\nus look down on bigots, denial and<br />\ndiscrimination of all sorts. It requires<br />\nthat we treat each member of the<br />\ncommunity with the same dignity<br />\nand fairness that we would expect<br />\nfrom others.<br />\nSo? It is important that the dean's<br />\ncommittee be formed now and a<br />\nresponse from the University be seen<br />\nwithin the next six months. Call, or<br />\nbetter still, write the Provost or Dean<br />\nof Institutional Affairs and let them<br />\nknow how you feel about this<br />\n\"curious anomoly\" of discrimination based on sexual orientation at<br />\nHopkins. It is wrong and should be<br />\nstopped!<br />\nWinston Vaughan<br />\nA&amp;S\u2014Hopkins '87, Stanford med<br />\nstudent and Hopkins Young Trustee<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe debate in these pages over<br />\nwhether or not ROTC should be<br />\nallowed to remain on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus has drifted, perhaps intentionally, and now revolves around<br />\nthe justifiability of the Department<br /><br />\nFOR APPOINTMENTS CALL:<br /><br />\nof Defense's exclusion of gays and<br />\nlesbians from military service and<br />\nthe value of the ROTC program to<br />\nthis university. While both issues are<br />\nworthy of close and objective<br />\nscrutiny, neither one is of paramount<br />\nconcern right now. Rather, the one<br />\nquestion which the Hopkins community can and must answer is \"Can<br />\nan academic institution maintain its<br />\nintegrity while lending support to (or<br />\nderiving support from)any organization which discriminates on the basis<br />\nof race, color, gender, heritage,<br />\npolitical persuasion, or sexual<br />\npreference?\" I believe, and our administration outwardly affirms, that<br />\nsuch discrimination is inconsistent<br />\nwith the goals and principles of a<br />\nuniversity such as ours.<br />\nIn this light, whether or not we<br />\nallow the ROTC program to remain<br />\non campus is no longer an issue unto itself, but rather becomes another<br />\nexample of the continuing gap between our actions and our so vocally<br />\nproclaimed policy. It is now of the<br />\nsame ilk as whether to retain investments in South Africa, whether<br />\nto allow discriminatory student<br />\ngroup to use university facilities, and<br />\nwhether to accept research grants<br />\nfrom sources such as the DoD. Nondescrimination is our stated policy,<br />\nour principle: there can be no exceptions and no compromise. We have<br />\nclaimed the moral high ground, and<br />\nnow we must stand on it.<br />\nAt the same time, we must execute<br />\nour judgment charitably. Immediate<br />\nremoval of ROTC from Hopkins<br />\nwould necessarily interrupt the<br />\neducation of those students who depend on its scholarships to pay their<br />\ntuition. Providing University support<br />\nfor those who would otherwise be<br />\nleft stranded by such action is morally appealing but perhaps not affordable. Allowing current participants<br />\nto finish the program while refusing<br />\nto let new students in is not<br />\nworkable, either, since an integral<br />\npart of the upperclassman's ROTC<br />\nexperience is the training of new<br />\ncadets. Rather, I would suggest giving the Department of Defense three<br />\nto five years to move the ROTC program to a different location, where<br />\nit can continue under auspices other<br />\nthan the University's. If the DoD<br />\ntruly has an interest in continuing the<br />\nprogram in this area, it could use one<br />\nof the many nearby military<br />\nfacilities. Moreover, if the ROTC<br />\nprogram paid the participants directly rather than the University, then<br />\nthe administration would not be able<br />\nto question students' involvement in<br />\nit. Participation would then be a matter of personal choice and beyond the<br />\nUniversity's jurisdiction. Such an arrangement, while undoubtedly inconvenient for the DoD, is not impossible and would preserve the<br />\nscholarship opportunities for those<br />\nfortunate enough to be eligible while<br />\nmaintaining the distance between the<br />\npolicies of the defense department<br />\nand the Hopkins community.<br />\nCertainly, it is also appropriate to<br />\nwrite to our Senators and Congressmen regarding our national integrity, as has been suggested.<br />\nNonetheless, now it is time to put<br />\nour own house in order.<br />\nDave Storm<br /><br />\nDon't walk into the December LSAT unprepared!

Kelly claims that \"Paul [Del<br />\nGrosso] and the rest of the Gay and<br />\nLesbian Alliance do not understand<br />\nthe importance of ROTC units in this<br />\ncountry.\" I clearly state in my<br />\neditorial that GALA is not antiROTC, but anti-discrimination. I<br />\npersonally believe that ROTC provides essential benefits to the student<br />\nbody and the country as a whole. I<br />\nunderstand that many students may<br />\nnot otherwise have been able to attend college if it were not for ROTC<br />\nscholarships. What J.P. Kelly either<br />\nfails to understand or address is the<br />\nimportance and interests of the gays<br />\nand lesbians who are already in<br />\nROTC and the military in general.<br />\nWhat about the importance of lesbians described as \"top performers\"<br />\nin the Navy who face being<br />\ndischarged? What about the importance of those gay cadets who have<br />\nbeen kicked out of ROTC, not<br />\nbecause of their service record, but<br />\nbecause of their sexual orientation?<br />\nWho will pay back the past scholarship money the Armed Service<br />\ndemands from these gay cadets who<br />\nare also \"our best scholars, athletes<br />\nand citizens\" (J.P. Kelly) and who<br />\nobviously needed financial assistance<br />\njust as much as anyone else? All<br />\nGALA members desire is for the<br />\nArmed Service to end its hypocrisy<br />\nand acknowledge people who are not<br />\nwaiting to get into the military, but<br />\nalready form an essential,\"important,\" part.<br />\nJ.P. Kelly also writes that reversing discrimination \"by going to the<br />\ncourt would be a much more productive and responsible move on<br /><br />\nScrew the Right Thing<br /><br />\nGALA's part and would be in the<br />\nbest interest of our nation.\" What<br />\nMr. Kelly fails to realize is that cases<br />\nregarding the military's general<br />\ndiscrimination policy have already<br />\ngone to the Supreme Court which<br />\nhas upheld the Armed Service's right<br />\nto discriminate since this is part of<br />\nmilitary law. The Court can only<br />\nuphold law, not change it. The Court<br />\nso far has refused to hear any case<br />\nregarding ROTC discrimination<br />\nspecifically since it feels its ruling<br />\nconcerning the general miilitary applies to all parts of the military.<br />\nThus, changing law is the only way<br />\nan end to discrimination will come<br />\nabout.<br />\nChanging law requires a little<br />\nmore than writing letters to our<br />\ngovernment as Mark E. Bateman implies when he writes,' A positive<br />\nmethod of advocating this change<br />\nwould be to deal with your Congressmen and Senators.\" If any of<br />\nthese \"best scholars, athletes and<br />\ncitizens\" actually believe you can<br />\nchange law simply by writing letters<br />\nto Congressmen and Senators, I<br />\nquestion their grasp of the political<br />\nsystem in this or any country. Applying direct pressure on government to change flawed policies is a<br />\ntried and true method for social<br />\nchange and applying this pressure in<br />\na way that threatens the military's<br />\nability to train its military officers on<br />\nthe best college and university campuses is certainly frontline pressure<br />\nand not \"back door pressure\" as<br />\nMr. Bateman claims.<br />\nUnfortunately, whatever the approach one takes on this issue, some<br />\nwill lose, at least in the short term.<br />\nThe approach GALA recommends,<br />\nwhich is one that is being followed<br />\non other college campuses, is to<br />\ngradually phase out ROTC by allowing those already in ROTC to finish<br />\nthe program, but not allowing new<br />\nstudents to enter. Yes, those new<br />\nstudents, which includes those gays<br /><br />\nand lesbians who choose to sneak into ROTC, will lose the financial<br />\nbenefits they could have otherwise<br />\nattained. Yes, this country will lose<br />\nthe ability to train officers on the best<br />\ncollege campuses. But, neither the<br />\ngay and lesbian community nor the<br />\npeople serving in the military should<br />\nbe to blame for this loss. The<br />\nhypocrisy of the leaders in our<br />\ngovernment and military should be<br />\nto blame and are the only ones deserving blame. Once the people of this<br />\ncountry see how this hypocrisy can<br />\nbe quickly and harmlessly changed<br />\nin a way that benefits everyone,<br />\nchange will come. That forcing this<br />\nchange must come from the university system reflects the fact that it is<br />\none of the few institutions on a national level to commit itself in<br />\nwriting to preventing discrimination<br />\nagainst gays and lesbians.<br />\nPerhaps Mr. Kelly's logic\u2014<br />\n\"Realize that you are only one faction in a world of many. Your victory is another man's defeat\"\u2014<br />\nsummarizes the present military<br />\nideology, but until some of the socalled majority groups in this country realize what unnecessary defeat<br />\nis like, victory for all will never be<br />\nachieved.<br />\nPaul Del Grosso<br />\nPresident of the Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nRe: Mark Bateman's support of<br />\nROTC [Letters, Sept. 28]<br />\nGiven that the Johns Hopkins campus includes lesbians and gays (not<br />\n\"homosexuals\" as the article refers<br />\nto gay men), and given that the<br />\nROTC program tramples the rights<br />\nof this group, how exactly can he<br />\nclaim that \"the entire campus<br />\nbenefits\"?<br />\nStephen Kent Jusick<br /><br />\nStephen Kent Jusick<br />\nSo you were thinking of<br />\nscreening some old Buster Keaton<br />\nfilms to commemorate the actor's<br />\nbirthday on Thursday, and you<br />\nthought some other people on<br />\ncampus might enjoy watching<br />\nthem too. Simple enough. You<br />\ncan have the Enoch Pratt central<br />\nbranch send the films to the<br />\nWaverly branch, no problem. But<br />\nwhere to view these shorts?<br />\nThere's the obvious\u2014the<br />\nArellano Theater, but the Barnstormers are using it. Okay, and<br />\nShriver Hall is booked by Special<br />\nEvents. Well, there is Shaffer 3,<br />\nbut Continuing Studies has a class<br />\nscheduled. So you're almost out<br />\nof luck.<br />\nThere should be more choices.<br />\nHow about Mergenthaler<br />\nAuditorium? Ideal, almost, except for the lack of a .sound<br />\nsystem. And don't expect the<br />\nMSE Audio-Visual Department<br />\nto help. They've never heard of<br />\na screening room. How about<br />\nMudd? Large, new, a suitable<br />\nvenue. Except the Department of<br />\nBiology won't let you at it.<br />\nWelcome to the Byzantine<br />\nworld of Hopkins room scheduling. The problems stem from the<br />\ndecentralization of the University. First you have to realize that<br />\nany student activity will get<br />\nbumped if an administrator wants<br />\nthe room\u2014even rooms that are<br />\npart of the \"student union.\" You<br />\nalso have to realize that there is<br />\nnone of the solidarity that<br /><br />\n\"union\" implies, and that the<br />\n\"union\" is just a word on a<br />\nregular building.<br />\nAll the other rooms are controlled by academic departments,<br />\nwhich jealously guard their tarnished treasures, or by Continuing Studies, which isn't set up to<br />\nbook something for a one-shot<br />\ndeal.

One<br />\nconservative who has a novel<br />\napproach to the problem is<br />\nJack Kemp, the once and<br />\nfuture presidential candidate<br />\nwho currently serves as the<br />\nsecretary of HUD. He has incorporated conservative ideals<br />\nabout free enterprise into a<br />\nprogram called HOPE\u2014Home<br />\nOwnership and Opportunity<br />\nfor People Everywhere. This<br />\nprogram encourages tenants of<br />\npublic housing to buy their<br />\nown apartments and aids those<br />\ntenants who want to buy out<br />\ndevelopers who plan to convert<br />\ntheir units into condos.<br />\nKemp recognizes the trappings of the \"plantation-style\"<br />\nwelfare system, which prevent<br />\nthose dependent upon the<br />\ngovernment from bettering<br />\ntheir condition without<br />\nforfeiting their aid. \"The War<br />\non Poverty has noble purposes,\" Kemp told the New<br />\nRepublic, \"but it turned the incentive structure upside down.<br />\n\"The problem isn't that<br />\nAmerica is caught immutably<br />\nbetween two economies\u2014a<br />\nmainstream economy in which<br /><br />\npeople respond rationally to<br />\nrewards like education, vicility, and opportunity, and a<br />\npoverty element that is written<br />\noff because we think they<br />\nwouldn't respond to rewards.<br />\nI disagree, politically and<br />\nmorally.

One of Kemp's favorite<br />\nexamples is Kimi Gray, who<br />\nsuccessfully transformed a<br />\nrun-down public housing complex in Washington, D.C. into a model of tenant-owned<br />\nhousing.<br />\nSuch a success story contrasts with the horrors of a tale<br />\nfrom the traditional welfare<br />\nsystem, which sharply curtails<br />\nincentive to save and earn<br />\nmoney.

The first exhibit created<br />\nas part of the Museum of<br />\nAmerican Folk Arts' program,<br />\nAccess to Art, is titled \"Bringing Folk Art Closer,\" showing<br />\nuntil November 11. The objects<br />\nof folk art from the 19th and 20th<br />\ncenturies are displayed to allow<br />\nviewers to touch them.<br />\nFolk art is made by folk artists<br />\nwho have little or no academic<br />\ntraining in art. For the most part,<br />\nthe folk art on display serves a<br />\nfunction. Yet the craftsmanship<br />\ntranscended function and became<br />\ndecoration as well. One example<br />\nis the display of quilts in the exhibition. The craft tradition of<br />\nquilt making brought out the<br />\nmakers' innate sense of design<br />\nand desire to create something<br />\nbeautiful. The quilt makers easily grasp the concept of piecing<br />\ntogether geometric shapes into<br />\npleasing patterns. To this they<br />\nadd a natural sense of color coordination, combining bright and<br /><br />\npatterned fabrics. In this exhibit,<br />\nthe viewer can appreciate the different textures of the fabrics as<br />\nwell, from plush velvet to glazed cotton. The beauty of the quilts<br />\nderives from an artistic common<br />\nsense that appeals to everyone.<br />\nOther functional and decorative<br />\nobjects are also fun, such as the<br />\nwhirligigs.

For those who are color<br />\nblind or have limited depth vision, all surfaces and objects<br />\nclosest to them contrast tin color. Large, high-contrast<br />\nphotographs of objects are provided for vision-impaired viewers<br />\nso that they may have a close look<br />\nat the entire object.

The men<br />\nwere edged by Franklin and Marshall 21-34 while defeating<br />\nWidener 21-38. The women were<br />\nbeaten by Swarthmore 21-34 and<br />\nFranklin and Marshall 16-40, but<br />\neasily topped Widener 20-40.<br />\nAs has been the case with every<br />\nother race so far this season, the<br />\nmen were led by senior cocaptain John Robinson, who<br />\ncovered the flat, five-mile course<br />\nin 28:34 for third place. The race<br />\nwas won by an impressive<br />\nFranklin and Marshall freshman,<br />\nSteve Monaco, who ran a<br />\nremarkable 27:17. \"He's very<br />\ngood for a freshman,\" said<br />\nHopkins coach Jim Grogan, \"but<br />\nJohn will beat him in the<br />\nMACs.\" Also running a strong<br />\nrace for the Blue Jays was Pete<br />\nGliatto, who captured fifth place<br />\nin 29:03. Other runners earning<br />\npoints for Hopkins were Manny<br />\nHosten (9th, 33:04), Mark Melia<br />\n(11th, 30:40), and co-captain<br />\nBasil Dahiyat (12th, 30:46)<br />\nThe split decision brought the<br />\nmen's record to 3-4 for the<br />\nseason, a record that is mainly the<br />\nresult ofa difficult early schedule.<br />\n\"We should pick up some easy<br />\nwins toward the end of the year,\"<br />\nGrogan said. Another key to improvement for the team is the<br />\nreturn of key runners from injuries. Although Dahiyat and Erik<br />\nMartz both ran in Friday's meet,<br />\nthey both appeared rusty. Still out<br />\nof the lineup is Dave Higgins.<br />\nThe women's team ran its third<br />\nrace in six days at Franklin and<br />\nMarshall. \"Although we didn't<br />\nexpect to beat Swarthmore or<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, it was<br />\npretty obvious that we were<br />\ntired,\" said head coach Eleanor<br />\nSimonsick.

Friday's<br />\nmeet leaves the women's team<br />\nwith a 3-4 record. According to<br />\nSimonsick, the team has had too<br />\ndifficult a schedule. Three of their<br />\nlosses have come to teams that<br />\nfinished among the top five in the<br />\nconference last year.<br />\nThe women's team is looking<br />\nahead to the Dickinson Invitational on Saturday, October 6th.<br />\nWith eight days of rest and the<br />\nexperience gained against the<br />\ntough competition, they expect to<br />\nfinish in the top three. The men's<br />\nteam will also be competing in the<br />\nDickinson Invitational. Although<br />\nthe team will be without its<br />\nnumber two runner, Pete Gliatto, the Blue Jays should be competitive, with everyone rested<br />\nfrom the busy past week.<br /><br />\nStreak<br />\nContinues<br />\nContinued from page 11<br />\nCenter. \"The pace will be a lot<br />\nfaster with those teams,\" warned head coach Bill Jones. \"I'm<br />\nhoping the momentum [of our<br />\nfive straight wins] carries<br />\nthrough.

Plantar fasciitis is a<br />\npartial or complete tear of the<br />\nfascia that covers the muscles<br />\non the bottom of the feet. That<br />\nfeeling you get that something<br />\nin your arch has ripped; well,<br />\nit has. Plantar fasciitis can be<br />\ncaused by a sudden pressure<br />\nexerted on the arch, shoes<br />\nwhich don't provide enough<br />\nsupport, stiff soled shoes<br />\n(remember those cleats), and<br />\nin-turned feet. Taping and/or<br />\northodics can help relieve<br />\nsome cases of plantar fasciitis,<br />\nand flexible soled shoes are<br />\nrecommended for most cases.<br />\nThe rest of us must suffer in<br />\nsilence; that cliched treatment<br />\nrest, is recommended.

But last Saturday, the Blue Jays were called<br />\nupon to show another facet of<br />\ntheir game: composure.<br />\nWhen teams get behind right<br />\naway, they get frustrated. They<br />\nwant to make something happen,<br />\nso they get really aggressive on<br />\nthe ball,\"said Hopkins head<br />\ncoach Mark Butler of a truly aggrivated Ursinus team.<br />\nThe Blue Jays gave the visiting<br />\nBears something to worry about<br />\nearly in the game, when senior<br />\nmidfielder Andrew Janis netted<br />\nhis first goal of the season, just<br />\n3:41 into the game.<br />\nRealizing that Ursinus was<br />\nmore interested in marking their<br />\nopponents with bruises than in<br />\nscoring goals, the Blue Jays adjusted their game plan and kept<br /><br />\nthe pressure on the offensive half<br />\nof the field.<br />\n\"Our players were composed<br />\nenough to work through (the<br />\nroughness),\" Butler said. \"We<br />\nare a thinking team, so the<br />\nplayers just held the ball less and<br />\nmade quicker passes. If you don't<br />\nhave the ball, the other team has<br />\nno reason to challenge you.\"<br />\nThirty minutes and several<br />\nfootball-style skirmishes latkT,<br />\nsenior defender Geoff Manning<br />\nadded a second unassisted goal,<br />\nto give the Blue Jays a 2-0 edge<br />\nat half-time.<br />\nAfter the break, coach Butler<br />\ntook advantage of the lead,<br />\nsubstituting players freely and<br />\nconcentrating on the more difficult aspects of the Blue Jay<br />\nattack.<br />\n\"We have a complicated game<br />\nplan, so when we are in control,<br />\nwe try to use that time to work<br />\non more complex things,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nButler also showed confidence<br /><br />\nin the Hopkins bench, changing<br />\nthe entire line-up with ten minutes<br />\nremaining in the game. The second string lived up to Butler's expectations, gracefully dodging, or<br />\nat least ignoring, Ursinus' flying<br />\nelbows and knees, while continuing the offensive pressure.<br />\nJunior forward Scott Wilson<br />\nscored the third and final goal of<br />\nthe game on a pass from<br />\nsophomore forward Emil Wang<br />\nwith less than five minutes to<br />\nplay.<br />\nIn addition to the team's collective cool temper, Butler credited<br />\nthe team's senior leadership with<br />\nthe win. \"The seniors have been<br />\nleading by example. There has<br />\nbeen no time when any of the<br />\nseniors have not worked up to<br />\ntheir potential, in practices or in<br />\ngames.

This season<br />\nBonds became only the second<br />\nplayer in history to ever hit 30<br />\nhomers and steal 50 bases.<br />\nCombined, Bonds and Bonilla<br />\nare league leaders in eight out<br />\nof the ten major NL offensive<br />\ncatagories. The offense for the<br />\nPirates will be the key, for<br />\nwhile the lineup has more than<br />\njust Bonds and Bonilla, their<br />\npitching staff is very shallow<br />\nand has very little beyond<br />\nDoug Drabek, NL leader at 22<br />\nand probable NL Cy Young<br />\nAward winner.<br />\nThis is where the Reus pitching staff steps in. League<br />\nleaders Tom Browning (15-9)<br />\nand Jose Rijo (14-8) will anchor the starting rotation,<br />\nwhile Rob Dibble (1.90 ERA)<br />\nand Randy Myers(1.92 ERA,<br />\n30 saves) will lead the relief<br />\nstaff. The core of the Reds is<br />\npotentially the best in the National League, but potential<br />\nmeans nothing when the<br />\nseason is on the line. Stopping<br />\nBonds and Bonilla are important for the Reds pitchers, but<br />\nthey cannot forget the rest of<br />\nthe Pirate lineup.<br />\nThe Reds offensive lineup is<br />\namidst several injuries, including one to star outfielder<br />\nEric Davis, who is expected to<br />\nplay in the series anyway, and<br />\nto newly acquired second<br />\nbaseman Bill Doran. This will<br />\nput the burden on rookie first<br />\nbaseman Hal Morris, who has<br />\ncarried much of the slack for<br />\nthe Reds since the All-Star<br />\nbreak, and all-star Mariano<br />\nDuncan.<br />\nThese are not the days of the<br />\nPirates of old when the chants<br />\nof \"We are Family,\" rang<br />\nthrough Three Rivers Stadium<br />\nin the late 70's, but the result<br />\nwill be the same. However, the<br />\nReds will not allow their<br />\nawesome start to be forgotten.<br />\nThe Pirates will take this series<br /><br />\ntour games to three, and the<br />\nkey will be not in the Pirates'<br />\nyoung tandem, but rather in<br />\nthe depth of the rest of their<br />\nstarting lineup. Pittsburgh,<br />\nthough will have to get a win<br />\nout of someone other than<br />\nDrabek.<br />\n\u2014Defending World Series<br />\nchampion Oakland A's are<br />\ncoming off their third consecutive American League<br />\nWest title. The 1990 AL East<br />\nchampion Boston Red Sox are<br />\nnot the same Sox who lost<br />\nunceremoniously to the Mets<br />\nin the 1986 World Series, but<br />\nthese are definitely the same<br />\nA's who have dominated play<br />\nthe past three seasons and had<br />\nthe best record in baseball this<br />\nseason.<br />\nIn head to head play, the A's<br />\ndefeated the Red Sox eight out<br />\nof twelve times this season.<br />\nThe Sox, though, will look to<br />\nput that record behind them as<br />\nthe series begins. Their hopes<br />\nrest on pitcher Roger Clemens.<br />\nBoston, which led their division by 6 1/2 games on<br />\nSeptember 4, proceeded to<br />\ndrop 15 of 22 games and ended up even with the Toronto<br />\nBlue Jays while Clemens was<br />\nsidelined with a shoulder injury. \"Rocket\" is the key to<br />\nboosting the team's frail confidence. Looking beyond<br />\nClemens, only a much improved Mike Boddicker (16-8) has<br />\nany chance of silencing the<br />\nsolid A's lineup.<br />\nThe starting rotation for the<br />\nA's consists of Bob Welch<br />\n(26-6 and probable AL Cy<br />\nYoung Award winner), Dave<br />\nStewart (22-10) and Scott<br />\nSanderson (17-11). The<br />\nOakland front office has refused to sit on its present talent<br />\nand has done its part to acquire<br />\nnew faces. NL batting chainpion Willie McGee (.335 BA)<br />\nwas obtained recently from the<br />\nSt. Louis Cardinals. McGee<br />\nadds a new dimension to the<br />\nteam, bringing with him speed<br /><br />\nas well as a high batting average. The team also<br />\nadded DH Harold Baines.<br />\nThe Red Sox have their own<br />\noffensive power. Their big<br />\nthree: Wade Boggs(.304 BA),<br />\nEllis Burks (.295 BA), and<br />\nMike Greenwell (.297 BA)<br />\nhave been hot of late and led<br />\nBoston to the top AL team batting average. However, in<br />\norder to overcome the top<br />\nrated pitching staff in baseball,<br />\nthey will need some help from<br />\nthe likes of Jody Reed and<br />\nTom Brunansky.<br />\nBarring another earthquake,<br />\nit seems like the only thing<br />\nwhich can overcome the A's<br />\nare their million dollar contracts and the million dollar<br />\negos which have come along<br />\nwith them. They have more<br />\ntalent than any other team in<br />\nbaseball today, possibly even<br />\nin baseball history. The stars<br />\nare the same as last year. Mark<br />\nMcGwire, Jose Canseco, the<br />\nHendersons (Rickey and<br />\nDave), Stewart, and Dennis<br />\nEckersley will all make their<br />\npresences felt in the series.<br />\nRickey Henderson was Mr.<br />\nEverything in the regular<br />\nseason for the A's. Look for<br />\nhim to decide whether the A's<br />\nwill dominate the series or not.<br />\nThe key for the Sox will<br />\ncome in Game 1 on Saturday<br />\nwhen Clemens should square<br />\noff against Welch. The Red<br />\nSox must win this game in<br />\norder to have any hopes of<br />\npulling off the upset. A Red<br />\nSox victory, however, is<br />\nunlikely, unless the ghost from<br />\nthe underdog LA Dodger team<br />\nwhich upset the A's in the<br />\n1988 World Series manages to<br />\nreappear with the Red Sox.<br />\nKnowing Boston's knack for<br />\nlosing big games, look for<br />\nOakland to win the series four<br />\ngames to two. However, if<br />\nClemens' shoulder is healed<br />\nand he can take the mound<br />\nmore than twice, then look for<br />\nthe series to be closer.<br /><br />\nIMPORTANT MEETING<br />\nFOR JIM<br />\nUNDERGRADS<br />\nwho want to know more about<br /><br />\nPUBLIC HEALTH<br />\nas a career option<br />\n$100 off 18K;$50 off 14K;$25 off 10K<br /><br />\nOrder your college ring NOW.<br />\nC.

In a community composed of<br />\nstudents of such caliber as Johns<br />\nHopkins, a president shouldn't believe<br />\nthat his job consists of improving<br />\ncafeteria food, or maintaining the status<br />\nquo. Such should be left to the responsibility of the students. The president of<br />\nsuch a community should be more concerned with matters that require<br />\norganized action by the whole community.

The obvious impact of issues such<br />\nas revising the Academic Advising Committee and the renovations of certain<br />\nbuildings on campus is precisely why the<br />\nneed for strong ideas and skilled leadership is so great. I have a knowledge of<br />\nboth of these through various activities<br />\nIn high school, including three years of<br />\nbeing president of my class.

It would be my main<br />\ngoal as Treasurer of the Class of 1994,<br />\nto both unify the student body and to<br />\nearn money. I have very easy access to<br />\na company that will supply us with the<br />\nmerchandise for fundraising, all I will<br />\nneed is your support.

As<br />\ntreasurer, I hope to help set up class ac-<br /><br />\ntivities, like beach cookouts, that<br />\neveryone will enjoy. In representing our<br />\nclass on the Student Activities Commission, I will work hard to make sure our<br />\nclass receives the money it needs.

Not only does a treasurer<br />\nmanage money, but he/she also comes<br />\nup with ideas on how to raise that<br />\nmoney, and puts them to work. So what<br />\nmakes me, Anna Morgan,the best candidate for the job? First, I am disciplined and dedicated to my responsibilities.<br />\nThis is exemplified in my involvement as<br />\na member of the Hopkins crew team,<br />\nthat demands a lot of time and energy.<br />\nAlso, last year, as a representative of my<br />\nclass, I channeled ideas and information<br />\nbetween students, thus helping to unite<br />\nthe senior class. This year, I will make<br />\nmyself open to any suggestions or complaints you may have. And I will initiate<br />\nand budget those activities for which<br />\nthere is a general consensus. So<br />\nremember, when you vote, chose the<br />\ncandidate that will work for you in realizing your hopes for the Class of 1994.

Therefore, my<br />\ndoor, phone line, and ears will always<br />\nbe open to all members of the freshmen<br />\nclass with any type of suggestion or<br />\ncomplaint.

I will put students in<br />\ntouch with groups, services, and other<br />\nstudents who share common interest,<br />\nand I will always be available to help someone with a question or concern. I will<br />\ntake these issues to the student council,<br />\nand if there is something that I can do,<br />\nI will not hesitate to get it done. My first<br />\npriority will always be the Class of 1994.<br /><br />\nStudent government serves not only<br />\nas a sounding board for students' opinions and concerns but even more,it can<br />\nbe considered a \"vehicle\" through which<br />\nchange is proposed, considered, and actually made. As freshmen, we represent<br />\na new class of students who possess the<br />\nstrength, talent, and spirit that many<br />\nother student bodies lack. Therefore. it<br />\nis necessary that we capitalize on our enthusiasm and elect a student government that will change Hopkins for the<br />\nbetter and make the administration<br />\nlisten to our undergraduate needs.<br />\nAs leaders, we must be able to take<br />\nour ideas and carry them forward with<br />\npassion and vigor so that we may make<br />\na lasting impression on Hopkins. It is<br />\nwith this in mind, as well as the aim of<br />\nproducing more strong and active<br />\ngovernment that I intend to contribute<br />\nmy energy, ideas and dedication to the<br />\nposition of freshman representative.<br /><br />\nTejas Mehta<br />\nThe desire to create change is a fundamental characteristic of each of us<br />\nhere at Hopkins. It is for this reason that<br />\nI have chosen to run for Freshman<br />\nRepresentative. I believe I can represent<br />\nthe Freshman class strongly in council<br />\nmeetings and work its goals to most<br />\nbenefit the Class of 1994. Our class is<br />\none of the largest to enter Johns<br />\nHopkins. As a result, representing such<br />\na class requires great responsibility and<br />\ndedication: two qualities I hope to exhibit to you. Therefore, I would be greatly honored to be your class rep, and I<br />\nlook forward to working with you.<br /><br />\nVishal Nigam<br />\nMelanie Hanger<br />\nHi, my name is Melanie Hanger and<br />\nI am running for the office of class<br />\nrepresentative. I live in Gildersleeve, the<br />\ncenter house of AMR II, in the room<br />\nright above the main entrance. This position puts me in the center of our<br />\nfreshman class geographically. As your<br />\nrepresentative, I hope to be in the center<br />\nof our class activities and events. I am<br />\nrunning for this office because I think I<br />\ncan help the Class of 1994 make a permanent mark at JHU.<br />\nIn high school, I had experience both<br />\nas a class representative and as a<br />\nmember of various school and class<br />\ncommittees. I think the most important<br />\nqualification of this position, however is<br />\nenthusiasm and a willingness to speak<br />\nout. In this area, I definitely qualify. I<br />\nhave no problem talking as much as<br />\nnecessary to get my point across, so if<br />\nyou want to be heard, \"VOTE FOR<br />\nMEL!\"<br /><br />\nMy major motivation for wanting to be a freshman representative is<br />\nI have several ideas on how to make life<br />\nbetter here. In addition, I believe that I<br />\nhave the character needed to accomplish<br />\nthese goals and to be an effective<br />\nrepresentative\u2014in that I am energetic,<br />\nopen-minded, and not afraid to take<br />\nchallenging stands. I think that the student body needs to have more school<br />\nspirit, to change the way that professors<br />\nare evaluated, and to revive the honor<br />\ncode. In order to increase the sense of<br />\ncommunity at this university, I would try<br />\nto increase the number of activities involving the entire student body. In the<br />\ncase of professor evaluations, professors should be appraised on their<br />\nmerit as teachers, as well as researchers,<br />\nInstead of the current system of evaluations based mainly upon their merit as<br />\nresearchers. Most importantly, I feel<br />\nthat a honor code based upon the integrity of the student is a necessity in a<br />\ninstitute of higher learning. I realize<br />\nthese changes may be difficult to<br />\nachieve; however I feel that they must be<br />\nvigorously pursued.<br /><br />\nDipak Panigrahi<br /><br />\nGreg Goodell<br /><br />\nThe duties and responsibilities of a<br />\ncouncil representative are something<br />\nthat all candidates must decide for<br />\nthemselves. As I see it, a community<br />\ncouncil representative is just that: a<br />\nrepresentative. My duty is not to decide<br />\nwhat I feel is correct or valid, but rather<br />\nto voice the opinions of the class as a<br />\nwhole. In a class as large as ours, containing approximately 860 individuals,<br />\nthis would appear to be quite a large<br />\ntask. Therefore, as a representative. I<br />\nam determined to be someone who is<br />\nboth easy to approach and talk to. It is<br />\nin this way that I feel I will be better able<br />\nto represent the interests of our entire<br />\nfreshman class.<br /><br />\nThe coming years at Johns Hopkins<br />\nwill be filled with new and exciting<br />\nevents. It is a new era for our university. As class representative I will work for<br />\nthe class and the achievement of our<br />\ngoals during these years of change. I will<br />\nwork to bring our class together, make<br />\nour views known to the university, and<br />\nwork to bring more activities to our campus. As president of my high school<br />\nclass, I gained the knowledge and experience needed to represent students<br />\nand their views. I want to use that<br />\nknowledge to serve the Class of 1994.<br /><br />\nBrad Holmberg<br />\nThe position of class representative<br />\nnot only entails communicating with the<br />\nstudent body, but acting from the information received. I want to interact with<br />\nthe students, faculty, and administration<br />\nto accomplish several goals tht will<br />\nbenefit our class. By increasing the total<br />\ninput of students we can pinpoint certain aspects of JHU that need improvement. These improvements will arise in<br />\nsocial, economic, and academic areas.<br />\nIdeas include a more diverse array of<br />\nentertainment, less expensive and higher<br />\nquality laundry facilities, and the encouragement of faculty-student and<br />\nstudent-student relations.
