The other, May 5, lead<br />\nto the deaths of three deputies and<br />\none miner. In this case, Mr. Johnson said that it is claimed that there<br />\nis a suspicion that the affair was<br />\nprearranged as a means to putting<br />\nan unpopular deputy \"on the spot\"<br />\nby the other deputies. This affair<br />\nbrought a crisis in the situation,<br />\n<br />\nof the operators.

I<br />\ndo not think it needs it. The<br />\nsuperb readiness which it has developed during these last ten<br />\nyears in the face of emergent<br />\ncatastrophe, the readiness to act,<br />\nand not only the readiness to act<br />\nbut the ability to act efficiently<br />\n--no one can doubt that in the<br />\nmidst of a National peril, should<br />\nit arise, the Red Cross would be<br />\nagain the expression of a patriotic spirit' which was the finest<br />\nthing that was aroused by the<br />\ntrial through which we passed in<br />\n1917.\"<br />\nThe Red Cross now has two<br />\nfunctions: it always stands ready<br />\nto aid whenever an emergency<br />\narises; and it has a program of<br />\nyea~-round useful activities.<br />\n\"It is, for example, now conducting drought relief in certain<br />\nnorthwestern states, where, except for the magnitude of the<br />\ngeneral situation, its operations<br />\nwould rank as a major effort of<br />\nits career.<br />\nThe northwest<br />\ndrought project is only dwarfed<br />\nby the fact that the Red Cross is<br />\njust emerging from a year in<br />\nwhich, besides giving drought relief in 23 states, it extended disaster aid in 52 calamities scattered<br />\nthrough 38 states.\"<br />\nThere is also the international<br />\nside of the Red Cross movement<br />\nwhich is of great interest for all<br />\nAmericans. At the close of the<br />\nWorld War and during the time<br />\nwhen peace adjustments were being ironed out, there was found<br />\nunder the leadership of a group<br />\nof Americans, the League of Red<br />\nCross Societies. Through the<br />\nformation of this body and the<br /><br />\nsubsequent operations of the<br />\nleague, there has developed an<br />\ninternational relationship in the<br />\nfield of the Red Cross and this<br />\nbond is becoming stronger as the<br />\nyears roll around.<br />\nThus the Red Cross today is<br />\nrounding out a half century of<br />\nhelpfulness and is marching onward with an indomitable spirit<br />\nof good will and comfort to the<br />\nneedy both home and abroad.<br /><br />\nII<br /><br />\nA Geologist Views Africa<br /><br />\nHOPKINS RIFLE CLUB<br />\nPOSTS '31 .SCHEDULE<br /><br />\nProfessor's Daughter<br />\nNamed Executive<br />\nMiss Doris Fielding Reid, daugh-<br /><br />\nter of Dr. H.
