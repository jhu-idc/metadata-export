He put the Blue Jays into a<br />\nlead they never relinquished by<br />\nconverting a flip from Rick<br />\nKowalchuk with,the game barely<br />\na minute old. Sophomore Franz<br />\nWittelsberger made the score 2-0<br />\nfour minutes later when he<br />\nquicksticked a Thomas feed into<br />\nthe net.

After the hosts hit<br />\nwith a power play shot, freshman<br />\nTom Myrick fired a \"Frank Urso<br />\nSpecial\" that nipped the left<br />\npipe, giving Hopkins a 6-2 margin<br />\nat the 8:18 mark.<br />\nK owalchuk matched the<br />\nMyrick drive on a fast break four<br />\nminutes later and Wittelsberger<br />\nclosed out the half with a pair of<br />\ntallies to make the score 9-2 at<br />\nthe break. However, the margin<br />\nwas deceptive at best. considering<br />\nhow flat the Blue Jays were<br />\nplaying throughout.<br />\nIn the third period. Rutgers<br />\nbegan to get some of the breaks,<br />\n<br />\nand their continuing pressure<br />\nbegan to tell on the Blue Jay<br />\ndefenders, who had done a<br />\ndecent job of keeping the Scarlet<br />\nKnights from getting open for<br />\ngoods shots. Finally, the host<br />\nteam came alive offensively,<br />\nscoring three goals in just over<br />\nninety seconds to close the gap<br />\n11-5.<br />\nStunting the Rutgers rally<br />\nslightly, Pat Sinram netted the<br />\nnext goal on a strong individual<br />\neffort.

It was a close<br />\nmeet the entire afternoon, being<br />\ndecided in the next to last<br />\nrunning event.<br />\nThe leading point scorer for<br />\nHopkins was co-captain Gerry<br />\nGreenfield. He had a double win<br />\nin the hurdles races, seconds in<br />\nthe 100 dash and the high jump,<br />\nand a place in the winning 440<br />\nyd. relay.<br />\nIn the sprints, Lon Massaglia<br />\nscored the first double win of the<br />\nyear with 10.2 in the 100 and<br />\n23.2 in the 220.

The trophy honors<br />\nCoach Rupert's late father, who<br />\n<br />\nGreenfield again had an<br />\nimpressive time in winning, 44.2,<br />\ntheir best in two years. This time<br />\nwould have been good enough<br />\nfor 4th place in the conference<br />\nchampionship last year.<br />\nOn the losing side, Towson's<br />\nEvans had a triple win in the<br />\nlong, triple and high jumps, as<br />\nwell as a place on their winning<br />\nmile relay.

The Board's decision to<br />\nappoint Dorsey was in<br />\nconcurrence with a<br />\nrecommendation made by an ad<br />\nhoc committee comprised of<br />\nstudents, faculty members, and<br />\nBoard members appointed last<br />\nApril to assist in the selection.<br /><br />\nDorsey refused to comment at<br />\nlength on any issues, noting only<br />\nthat cooperation with Hopkins<br />\nwas \"a very high priority\" and<br />\nthat \"great efforts have been<br />\nmade all year long and will<br />\ncontinue to be made concerning<br />\nfinancial problems.\"<br />\nSondheim publicly endorsed<br />\nDorsey's presidency, asserting<br />\nthat \"It is particularly gratifying<br /><br />\nNew health program announced<br />\nA new, comprehensive Student<br />\nHealth Program which will<br />\nprovide services to all students of<br />\nthe University, in qddition to<br />\ntheir spouses and children, has<br />\nbeen announced through the<br />\nOffice of the Provost to take<br />\neffect this September.<br />\nThe improved health service<br />\nprogram, designed by Torrey C.<br />\nBrown, M.D., Director of the<br />\nOffice of University Health<br />\nServices, is being offered to<br />\nstudents in all divisions of the<br />\nUniversity in conjunction with<br />\nthe Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans<br />\nof coverage, Major Medical, with<br />\nnervous and mental coverage and<br />\nDiagnostic No. 3.<br />\nThe cost of the insurance plan<br />\nwill be substantially higher next<br />\nyear for individual students,<br />\nthough, accord:ng to Brown, it<br />\nwill remain relatively the same,<br />\neither in the case of the parent<br />\nand child, or the family coverage<br />\nplan. Brown estimated that the<br />\n$85.68 fee for a single student<br />\nwould nearly double that of last<br />\nyear's policy plan fee. Other fees<br />\ninclude $175.08 for a parent and<br />\nchild, and $232.44 for a student<br />\nand wife, or a family.<br />\nThe extension of<br />\nHopkins -sponsored health<br />\nservices to members outside the<br />\nacademic community represents<br />\nan important added feature to<br />\nthis fall's program, according to<br />\nBrown.<br />\n\"Spouses and children now are<br />\neligible to come to the Health<br />\ncenters as if they were students<br />\nthemselves,\" Brown commented.<br />\nLast year, only the student in<br />\nthe household could be treated at<br />\nHopkins, according to the<br />\nprovisions of that system.<br />\nOther improvements in the<br /><br />\nAL_<br /><br />\nAll<br /><br />\nSt udent policy include<br />\ncomprehensive health care for all<br />\nillnesses and, in addition,<br />\nhospitalization and any need for<br />\ndiagnostic testing, provided all<br />\ntreatments and/or referrals were<br />\nhandled through Hopkins' Health<br />\nService.<br />\nThe new service will handle<br />\nmost medical needs, including<br />\npsychiatric care, either through<br />\none of four Hopkins Health<br />\nCenters or at the Hopkins<br />\nHospital in East Baltimore. Any<br />\nattention that cannot be received<br />\nat these locations will receive<br />\nattention by further referral.<br />\nBrown pointed out that any<br />\nmedical fees which might fall<br />\noutside of the range of Blue<br />\nCross coverage would be handled<br />\nwithin a sanctioned budget of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nSpend<br />\n\"The University authorized me<br />\nto spend significantly more out<br />\nof its own funds for thins this<br />\npolicy doesn't cover,\" Brown<br />\nstated.<br />\nFor instance, the Diagnostic<br />\nNo. 3 portion of the policy<br />\ncompensates financially only up<br />\nto $100 per illness for idagnostic<br />\ntests or laboratory fees.<br />\nBrown cited particular<br />\nadvantages for the switch-over to<br />\nthe Blue Cross agency, including<br />\nthe non-profit policy of this<br />\ngroups as opposed to that of such<br />\nprofit-making companies as<br />\nMutual of Omaha, sponsors of<br />\nthis year's health service pc'icy.<br />\n\"Blue Cross is universally<br />\naccepted by all hospitals whereas<br />\nMutual [of Omaha] is not,\"<br />\nBrown pointed out.<br />\n\"Blue Cross is a nor ,,rofit<br />\norganization.

The trophy honors<br />\nCoach Rupert's late father, who<br /><br />\nGreenfield again had an<br />\nimpressive time in winning, 44.2,<br />\ntheir best in two years. This time<br />\nwould have been good enough<br />\nfor 4th place in the conference<br />\nchampionship last year.<br />\nOn the losing side, Towson's<br />\nEvans had a triple win in the<br />\nlong, triple and high jumps, as<br />\nwell as a place on their winning<br />\nmile relay.
