By confusing the<br />\nand members of greater society. legitimate arguments of the<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nminers with the foolish actions of<br />\nthe Student Council, you did a<br />\ngreat disservice to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe act of the Student Council<br />\nwas precipitate; unfortunately<br />\nso--they should have instead<br />\nmounted a fair but powerful<br />\nattempt to inform the student<br />\nbody about all the issues, from<br />\nboth sides. Since I suspect that<br />\nwere the intelligent Hopkins<br />\nstudent told all the facts--the<br />\nsafety issues, the persecution of<br />\nthe strike leaders, the deaths in<br />\nand out of the mine, the state<br />\npolice assaults--he would support<br />\nthe miners. This well-informed<br />\nand more solid support could be<br />\nutilized to do meaningful acts in<br />\naid of the strikers, such as<br />\nassisting the caravans to the<br />\nminers. The Council's<br />\nannouncement is reminiscent of<br />\nthe traditional student<br />\nfulmination, with no more effect<br />\nthan ever--the words without the<br />\nactions.<br />\nAs for the News-Letter's<br />\nfailure, it was one of mixing a<br />\nvalid issue with a factless,<br />\ngroundless emotional appeal. TI-ke<br />\nstudents' \"jurisdiction\" is in<br />\nAppalachia, and everywhere<br />\nplse\u2014our, and, everybody's,<br />\njurisdiction is humanity.<br />\nAnyway, Appalachia is as close as<br />\nyour nearest power plant.<br />\nSupporting the miners is not<br />\nassuming \"God-given rights\" and<br />\npicking on `poor<br />\ncapitalism;'<br />\n<br />\nit is defending the rights for<br />\npeople to live without an<br />\narbitrary death constantly<br />\nthreatening. That is the basis of<br />\nthe strike--the right to wildcat is<br />\nliterally the right to life--the<br />\nmoney issues conic second.

And<br />\nunlike<br />\nIi e<br />\npublicized misconception that the<br />\nUMW is a dangerous and reckless<br />\ngiant union, the truth of the<br />\nmatter is that the powerful and<br />\ndemanding side is the<br />\nowner's --including such<br />\nenormities as U.S. Steel and<br />\nContinental Oil. The BCOA is<br />\ntrying to crush the union; this<br />\nconflict is the battle of a truly<br />\ndemocratic union, controlling<br />\nonly half the production of coal,<br />\nto survive as a unit and as<br />\nindividuals.

The average<br />\nminer would earn $80 a day in<br />\nthe last year of the rejected<br />\ncontract, three years hence. This<br />\nis up from the $60 a day that<br />\nthey now earn, but is admittedly<br />\na far cry from the $120 a day<br />\noriginally demanded by the<br />\nUnion. These new wage figures<br />\nwould result in the miners getting<br />\npaid $10 an hour at the end of<br />\nthe contract, which is $400 a<br />\nweek or $20,800 a year, up from<br />\nthe $16,500 which they now<br />\nwarn. Incidentally, our figures<br />\nare from the New York Times,<br />\nTuesday, March 7th.<br />\nThe Council mentions the<br />\npoint that non-Union miners<br />\nactually make more than Union<br />\nminers.

To this end a<br />\nreport was presented by a group<br />\n<br />\nof students who had been<br />\nworking together to draw up<br />\nproposals for a constitution for<br />\nsuch an organization. Following<br />\nthis report, the meeting discussed<br />\nat some length the question of<br />\nhow to create such an<br />\norganization in a democratic and<br />\norderly manner, and in particular<br />\nhow to ensure that all graduate<br />\nstudents are given a voice in that<br />\nprocess.<br />\nAfter discussion, a series of<br />\nresolutions was passed,<br />\nembodying both the sense of the<br />\nreport on the constitution and<br />\nthe sense of the meeting.<br />\nTogether, these call upon the<br />\ngraduate students in each<br />\nDepartment to elect a member to<br />\na Provisional Council of<br />\nRepresentatives which will<br />\nsupervise the drafting of a<br />\nConstitution. Once drafted, this<br />\nConstitution will be discussed in<br />\nthe Departments and approved<br />\nby the Council; it will then be<br />\ndiscussed in a further Open<br />\nMeeting. Finally it will be placed<br />\nbefore all graduate students for<br />\n<br />\napproval by referendum.<br />\nThe most important<br />\nachievement of this meeting,<br />\nthen, was that it took the first<br />\nconcrete steps toward<br />\nestablishing a Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization at<br />\nJohns Hopkins.

That's what I<br />\nreally want.\"<br />\nERCOLANO: How did you first become interested in<br />\nbaseball?<br />\nBROOKS: I never really did anything else as far as I can<br />\nremember but play ball. I've always been interested in it,<br />\nand my Dad encouraged me to play. He played a lot of<br />\nsemi-pro ball aroeild Little Rock. I went to the same high<br />\nschool as he did, and I kind of followed in his footsteps. I<br />\njust always !lad an interest in ball and played on as many<br />\nteams as I could Wnen I was growing up.<br />\nE: You played in high school too?<br />\nBROOKS: I didn't play nigh school baseball;they didn't<br />\nhave high school baseball in Arkansas. But toe last four<br />\nyears before I signed, I played American Legion baseball.<br />\nBefore that I played Midget League which is similar to tne<br />\nLittle League, and Junior League which is similar to the<br />\nPony League. I played for two or three clubs and spent a<br />\nlot of time around the LaMar Porter Field in Little Rock<br />\nwhere everything happened. I went to grammar school<br />\nright across the street from there and I used to work out<br />\nthere. They had a lot of baseball and Fast-Pitch Softball<br />\ngames. E: As a yuungster, did you have any sports heroes?<br />\nBROOKS: My hero growing up was always Stan Musial.<br />\nSt. Louis was the closest big-league team to Little Rock<br />\nand we'd pick up some of the games oil radio, so I kind of<br />\nfollowed Stan Musial. He was my idol as a youngster.<br />\nE: When did you decide mat you were going to make<br />\nyour career out of baseball?<br />\nBROOKS: I always thought I was going to make a career<br />\n'out of it as long as I can remember, even going back to<br />\nwhen I was a kid, twelve, thirteen years old. I thought for<br />\nsure I was going to be a big-league baseball player. Maybe<br />\nthat was taking a lot for granted, but I never wanted to do<br />\nanything else. I wrote a booklet in the eighth grade on<br />\n\"My Vocation,\" and I wrote mine on being a professional<br />\nbaseball player, so my wnole life was kind of geared<br />\naround that. I didn't play football in nigh school because<br />\n<br />\nI didn't want to take a cliance on getting hurt. I ran track<br />\njust to get in shape for baseball. Baseball was the only<br />\nthing I ever wanted to do.<br />\nE: If it weren't for baseball, what other line of wort_<br />\nmight you have gone into?<br />\nBROOKS: Well, I nad<br />\nscholarships to several schools to play basketball. I really<br />\ndon't know what I would nave done, toough. My interest<br />\nreally was baseball. I would probably be living in Arkansas<br />\nsome wnere. But if I didn't play baseball or sign<br />\nprofessionally in 1955, I would've gone to the University<br />\nof Arkansas on a basketball scholarship.<br />\nE: You seemed to have a Knack for brilliant performances<br />\nin big games, like All-Star games, World Series, etc. Did<br />\nyou get more psyched for Mose games?<br />\nBROOKS: I don't know if I got psyched but mere is a<br />\ndifferent feeling involved when you play in an All-Star<br />\ngame or a playoff or a World Series. In baseball you play<br />\nso many games, you very seldom get excited about a ball<br />\ngame because it's like a job, day in, day out. It's not like<br />\nplaying once a week in football where everything builds<br />\nup to that one day, and if you're not really ready<br />\nphysically or mentally, you just get blown rigiit out of the<br />\nball park. But in baseball it's an entirely different<br />\napproach, because you are playing every day and your<br />\nbody just doesn't respond to getting all hyped-up every<br />\ntime you run onto the field. When you have an All-Star<br />\ngame or a World Series, you really do feel it inside and<br />\nlike the old cliche says, the adrenalin starts to flow. Ws a<br />\ngood feeling to have. It doesn't mean you're going to<br />\nperform well because I've felt like that and I played lousy<br />\nand I've felt like that and played pretty good. But I<br />\nbelieve that every player likes to feel that when the chips<br />\nare down, when the money's on the table, ne can perform<br />\nbest of all. Like I said, under those circumstances I played<br />\npretty bad and other times I played pretty good. But I<br />\nthink every athlete likes to think he can do it when it's<br />\nreally needed.<br />\nE:Of all the big moments of your career, is there one that<br />\nthere one tnat stands out?<br />\n<br />\na great iustinct for the game. Kaline, Mantle, getting a<br />\nchance to play against Clemente mien he was in his<br />\nprime...those names come to mind more than others.<br />\nYazstremski too. Arid I played against Mays and AarOflaj<br />\nand it was a big thrill. I got to see Ted Williams win al.<br />\nbatting championship. I played against him a couple Of ji<br />\nyears. In his last game at Fenway Park, Williams nit<br />\nhome run in his last time at bat. I was in that game. I saw<br />\nMickey Mantle come off tile bench after being injured for<br />\na long time and he hit a pinch-hit home run to win 3<br />\ngame. Things like that come back to you.<br />\nE: Could you come up with an All-Star team, position by<br />\nposition, based on the players you've seen over the past<br />\ntwenty years?<br />\n<br />\nz<br />\n<br />\nBROOKS: I think that playing in my first World Series in<br />\n1966 was my biggest thrill, mainly because as a youngster<br />\nyou always look forward to signing, hen getting into the<br />\nbig leagues, then winning the pennant and getting to the<br />\nSeries, and being world champions. For that reason, I<br />\nlook at the '66 Series as my big moment in the game.<br />\nE: In the first game ot the '66 Series in LA,after you and<br />\nFrank Robinson nit back-to-back home runs in the first<br />\ninning, what were your feelings as you ran around tile<br />\nbases alter your home run?<br />\nBROOKS: Oh, tnat was just unbelievable, the first time<br />\nup to hit back-to-back home runs, Frank and Brooks. I<br />\nlike to think that's what turned the tide of the whole<br />\nSeries, tnat kind of snocked them right there.<br />\n<br />\nBROOKS: Not really. I ilaven't really sat down and done<br />\nthat. But I don't know anybody who played shortstop as<br />\nwell as Mark Belanger. Luis Aparicio and Belanger, I just<br />\nput them in a class by themselves, defensively. I don't<br />\nthink I saw anybody play as good a second base as Bobby ,<br />\nGrich did tiie year he set the record for fewest errors by'''<br />\nsecond baseman. Paul Blair was the best centerfielder<br />\nsaw. So I think I played with some guys who rank right ...I<br />\nthe top of my book for going after tile ball and catching<br />\nthe ball. These, guys were just the best tilere were.<br />\nE: What's your opinion of baseball today? Has it bee<br />\ncheapened by all the mingling over money?<br />\nBROOKS: What's happened over the past two years. W ith<br />\neverybody having a chance to become great, has beer<br />\ntotally unfair to the owners, but they really brought it or<br />\nthemselves by not working out a reserve system that<br />\nwould be fair and equitable to both sides. We now haveal<br />\nsystem that starts tiiis year wilich I think is fair to the I<br />\nowners and the players. It simply states that when You<br />\nsign with a team, they'll send you to the minor leagues<br />\nand then you are obligated to that organization for si%<br />\nyears. After six years, you've an option wiiether you want<br />\nto stay with tnat ball club or go play somewhere else. .<br />\nI think that what's happening in sports is just a sigh'\u00b0I<br />\nthe times. With the society we live in,pay is not based on<br />\nthe importance of your job. If that were the Case'<br />\nentertainers and athletes would be at the bottom of t11<br />\nheap. We live in a society that's fun-seeking alniA<br />\nsports-oriented, and in this society, athletes all<br />\nentertainers profit more than anybody else. So I can't get<br />\nupset when I see athletes get the money toey're getting<br />\nbecause I look at it in relation to now tnach moncY is<br />\ngenerated by sports. It's not how important your job is'<br />\nWe generate a lot of money and we are to share ill<br />\nWhen an entertainer makes $100,000 in one night, peoPte<br />\nseem to take that pretty easy. But when they see 31:<br />\nathlete make $200,000 or $300,000 a year, they ge<br />\npretty uptight about toat.<br />\nE:Besides the money situation, how has the game challgej<br />\nsince you broke in?<br />\n<br />\nE. Of all the awards you've won, is there one more special<br />\nthan the rest?<br />\nBROOKS: I think that winning the Hickok Belt in 1970<br />\nfor my performance in the World Series was certainly the<br />\nnicest--well, not the nicest, but certainly the most<br />\nlucrative award I had ever won. I think the MVP award in<br />\n1964 was the best one I received because it was for<br />\nsomething that was sustained over the wilole year, not<br />\njust for a four or five game series.<br />\nE: Whom do you rate as some of the best players you've<br />\nplayed with and against?<br />\nBROOKS:: Certainly Frank Robinson in Baltimore was<br />\none of tile all-time great players I played with. He just Had<br />\n<br />\nBROOKS: The game has not changed much between 1111.:<br />\nlines. There have been a few changes which I think If%<br />\nhelped the game. I toink the designated hitter has beell4<br />\nplus. The astroturf is not going to cnange the game %ee<br />\n'<br />\nl<br />\nmuch. Most of the people who go to the games like t\u00b0 re<br />\naction. They like seeing more hits, more doubles, 111\u00b0,,e<br />\nist<br />\ntriples, more runs, and with the astroturf and'<br />\ndesignated hitter, you're going to see all these things. rid`.0<br />\nof the changes have come outside of the game itself,\u00b0Iv<br />\nthe owners and the players and the negotiations and Ito<br />\nplayers' union. Another change is taut they're gotog<br />\nmore specialties, such as the relief pitcher, the i)1J1<br />\n'<br />\nid<br />\nrunner, the designated runner, but overall, baseball'\"<br />\n<br />\n\fson S ca s<br />\nall professional sports, are just booming now. I've been<br />\nhearing for the past fifteen years, \"We're going to kill the<br />\ngoose that laid the golden egg. Baseball is on a<br />\ndownswing.\" But last year more people went through tile<br />\nturnstiles than ever before, even if you don't count the<br />\ntwo new expansion teams. I think there is. a saturation<br />\npoint with all tile free agents and so on, but will' tills new<br />\nSystem titat we nave now, we're going to get back to a<br />\nlittle normalcy.<br />\nE: Do you think the quality of the players has changed<br />\nmuch through<br />\npast 20 years?<br />\nBROOKS: I ti., the quality of the players is about the<br />\nsame. With all the multi-year contracts being passed<br />\naround, Liere might be a tendency with some players to<br />\nplay when they feel like it. The majority are certainly<br />\ngoing to be out there every day, playing no matter what<br />\nkind of money they're making. You are going to have an<br />\nattitude among some guys like,\"I've got a headache, or a<br />\nhangnail. I'm not going to play today.\"<br />\nE: Everyone has an opinion of Bowie Kuhn. What's<br />\nyours?<br />\nwith<br />\nBROOKS: Well, Bowie has been faced<br />\never<br />\nbeen<br />\nhas<br />\ncommissiOner<br />\nfaced<br />\nother<br />\ndecisions that no<br />\n<br />\nWith, but I don't think he's really been consistent with a<br />\nlot of the things that he's done. I don't think he had the<br />\nright to tell Charlie Finley that he couldn't sell so-and-so.<br />\nThat wouldn't have been so detrimental to baseball, as he<br />\nwould say.<br />\nE: Do you think Kuhn should be fired?<br />\nBROOKS: Well, Bowie is in a good position; he just<br />\nsighed a seven-year contract or something, so if the<br />\nowners say they want to fire him, he'll say go ahead and<br />\nfire me, because ne knows he's going to get paid. See, tile<br />\nCommissioner really \u2022ilas been the tool of the owners.<br />\nThey're the ones that nire him, they're the ones that fire<br />\nhim, they're the ones that tell nim what to do. I'm<br />\ndisappointed in him for not stepping in before we got to<br />\nthis one-and-one situation (where players sign one-year<br />\nContracts and the. next year become free agents). He<br />\nShould've said to the owners,\"Hey, work something out<br />\nWith the players.\" He didn't do . that and I'm very<br />\nd isappointed that that didn't happen, otherwise we<br />\nwouldn't have been in the situation we've had the past two<br />\nYears with the free agents. He is at the whim of the<br />\n?vvners. If they're paying him $150,000 a year, believe me,<br />\nIi Certain situations he.is not going to go against the<br />\no wners., And lie knew what was right for baseball. He<br />\nshould nave stepped in and said, \"Hey, work something<br />\nout with these guys.\" Instead, the owners said to him,<br />\n,Hey, shut up and sit down over there. We pay your<br />\ns`darY and we're going to tell you what to do.\" You can't<br />\nPlease all the owners. He went ahead and made some<br />\n(lecisions that he felt were in the best interests of baseball.<br />\nINli<br />\n.at's why we're having all this conflict now.<br />\nt..<br />\n_s Spring training starts this week in Miami for the<br />\nloles. What are your feelings when you think this is the<br />\nIirst time in over 20 years that you'll miss spring training?<br />\n<br />\n4\u00b01<br />\n<br />\nset<br />\n<br />\n1011<br />\n<br />\nlost<br />\n<br />\nwit)<br />\ntile<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nJIVA<br />\n101'<br />\n<br />\nthkOOKS:This is the first time in 22 years that I didn't go<br />\ni\u00b0 spring training. But it's been a ctazy transition because<br />\nA don't have any desire to put the uniform on again. I<br />\nuon't even think about going tO Florida or playing, and I<br />\nthink it probably stems from last year. Sitting and<br />\niw.atching the games took it all out of me. I mean, I just<br />\nye to play and when I stopped playing, that was it for<br />\nC. I had enough and I don't have any desire to put the<br />\n,niform on again, or be a coach or a manager. I have a<br />\n\"e.stre sometimes to be a college coach, and I think I<br />\night pursue that. Maybe in a few years, I don't know.<br />\n<br />\nThat would be the only way I would ever do anything in<br />\nbaseball again as far as on the field activities are<br />\nconcerned.<br />\nE: When approximately did you make the decision to<br />\nretire?<br />\nBROOKS: I would say during the last half of last season<br />\nwhen realizing that a lot of the young guys were going to<br />\ndo the job and we were going to win a lot of games. If the<br />\nyoung guys hadn't played well and we hadn't nad such a<br />\ngood start, then I think I would have played a lot last<br />\nyear. But the young guys were doing the job so I figured<br />\nI'd never be playing again. I could've winked it out to go<br />\nto a few other places for a year, but it really wasn't<br />\nworthwhile for me to pick up and go to Seattle (I talked<br />\nto them), Toronto or Pittsburgh. If! could have worked it<br />\nout for a couple of years, I'd probably have gone ahead,<br />\nbecause I wanted to play and I thought I could play.<br />\nE: How difficult was it for you to make that decision-to<br />\n' retire?<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBROOKS: It really wasn't difficult. I just kind of lost<br />\ninterest last year and my priorities changed when I wasn't<br />\nplaying. I just thought, well, this is ridiculous being on the<br />\nroad all the time, not being nome, and you're not really<br />\n<br />\naccomplishing any<br />\nSo I couldn't have been nap pier<br />\nwhen it was all over. I never thought it would be Mat way<br />\nbut that's how it happened.<br />\nE: When you turned 30, did you look ahead and say, \"I'm<br />\ngoing to play so many more years, then retire,\" or were<br />\nyou going to make . that decision when the time<br />\ncomes?<br />\nBROOKS: I- said I was going to play as long as I could,<br />\nand I thought they'd probably have to tear the uniform<br />\noff me because I enjoyed playing, the money was great,<br />\nand all the things that went along with being a ballplayer<br />\nwere just everything I dreamed of and better., I just made<br />\nup my mind that I'd play as long as I could, but when it<br />\nstopped being fun or I wasn't playing that'd be it.<br />\nE:In a recent SPORTING NEWS article, some baseball<br />\nwriter claimed that you might not get elected:into the Hall<br />\nof Fame for a couple of tries, or that you might not get<br />\nelected at all, because you're not well known in the<br />\nNational League and you didn't hit .300 lifetime. Did you<br />\nsee that?<br />\nBROOKS: Well, I don't put much faith in that guy. That<br />\nwas Bill Broeg that wrote that and I think he's all wet. I<br />\nnever thought too much about the Hall of Fame until I<br />\nretired, and everybody said to me, well, in five years,<br />\nyou're going to be elected. If I had to put my money on<br />\nit, I think I'll get elected the first time around.(Laughs)<br />\nMaybe not. You're asking me, I don't know. I tell you, I<br />\ndon't even know what it takes to get elected to tne Hall<br />\nof Fame, and that's how closely I follow it. I don't<br />\nknow who votes; I know it takes a certain percentage to<br />\nget elected. But anyway I read that article. My answer to<br />\nhim is that he never really got to see me play either, so<br />\nwho knows?<br />\nE; Who was your favorite manager?<br />\nBROOKS:'think Paul Richards, and Earl Weaver. They're<br />\nboth different from tne usual run of managers.,They both<br />\nrun the game well. I thought Paul Richards was God really<br />\nwhen I signed; then he actually was the guy managing<br />\nwhen I came up. Weaver came along and Earl just seemed<br />\nto have the knack. He's just like a little bantam rooster,<br />\nrunning around doing this and that. I got a lot of laughs<br />\nout of him, but he runs the game very well. Time biggest<br />\nthing in managing is getting the respect of the players,and<br />\nalso being able to handle your pitching staff. But you've<br />\ngo to have the horses. You can be the greatest manager in<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 the world, but if you don't have the horses, you're not<br />\ngoing to win.<br />\nE; Do you think Weaver is the managerial genius he's<br />\nreputed to be?<br />\nBROOKS: I think he's a good manager, yeah. I think he<br />\nruns the game well. The Orioles in the past 21 years have<br />\nwon more games than anyone in either league which I<br />\nthink is a pretty significant fact. We've just had good<br />\nplayers that Earl's been able to handle. He received his<br />\njust due this past year (the Manager of the Year Award).<br />\nEight years ago we were winning all those games, people<br />\njust said, well, Earl should win, he's got the players.<br />\nBut last year nobody really thought we had that good a<br />\nclub. He was named manager of the year, and rightly so.<br />\nWe played as well as we could last year and I think he got<br />\nthe maximum out of everybody.<br />\nE: What do. you think of Frank Robinson's getting a<br />\ncoaching job with the Orioles?<br />\nBROOKS: That's a good thing. Frank and Earl really nave<br />\na good rapport.' think it's good to have somebody to lean<br />\non sometime or to ask a '')w questions of. And Frank's a<br />\ngood baseball man. He's .dedicat,%1 and he wants to be in<br />\nthe game for the rest or his life as a coach or a manager.<br />\nThere's really no pressure, no friction, because Earl<br />\nWeaver can get some job anyplace he wants to. It's not<br />\none of those things. where Frank's- going to be looking<br />\nover his shoulder because I think everybody realizes that<br />\nEarl is going to be around for a while and that he's the<br />\nboss. Frank can add a lot of things to,the ball club_ and<br />\nhe'll help since Weaver lost George Bamburger and Billy<br />\nHuntcr.<br />\nE: You're sure you wouldn't want to coach or manage in<br />\nthe majors some day?<br />\nBROOKS: No, I have no desire to put the uniform on<br />\nagain. I never will. I'm sure of that.<br />\nE: Have you gotten baseball. out of your system? If so, do<br />\nyou think you'll get the bug again?<br />\nBROOKS: No, I don't think I'll ever get the bug again.<br />\nThis really has been one of tile most exciting times of life<br />\nfor me, this whole transition, because everything before<br />\nthis was just cut and dry. You knew you had to be here<br />\nand be there. The last six months, my wife and I have had<br />\nto sit down and talk over a lot of things, which we never<br />\nhad to do before. We had to make decisions, on different<br />\njob offers I've mid and it's just been kind of an interesting<br />\nthing to go through. I just don't. want to go down and<br />\nwork as liard as I've worked, as far as getting in shape is<br />\nconcerned.- I've -just had enough baseball. That's hard to<br />\nbelieve, because I -never thought I'd be sitting nere saying<br />\nthat. I thought I'd always be willing to go, go, go baseball.<br />\nBut I have no desire to do that anymore. /<br />\nE: I thought I'd ask an expert. What's the best way to<br />\nbreak in a new glove?<br />\nBROOKS: I've seen guys break them in many ways. The<br />\nonly way I've broken in one is just to play in it. Take it<br />\nout and use it. I had two or three gloves; one I used in a<br />\ngame, the other two I'd use. during infield practice or<br />\nplaying catch. I've never broken a glove in any other way<br />\nexcept just playing with it and using it. I'd always try to<br />\ndocto\u2018 it up, take out the heel and make it a little flatter.<br />\nI've seen some guys like Aparici and Clint Courtney<br />\ntake their \u2022gloves, put a ball in, it, wrap it up in two or<br />\nthree big rubber bands. Then 'they'd soak it overnight,<br />\ntake it out, and let it hang for about a month. When they<br />\nopened it up, they'd have a nice pocket in there. But most<br />\n,of the gloves today are pretty well broken in when you<br />\nbuy them.<br />\nE:How do you think- the Orioles will .do this year?<br />\nBROOKS: I think the Orioles are going to have a good<br />\nyear. They're going to win a lot of games. I don't tilink<br />\nthey're going to be able to match New York and Boston.<br />\nNew York and Boston nave more talent than the Orioles.I<br />\nreally feel we played potentially as good as we could last<br />\nyear. We've got some good players, but I don't see how<br />\nwe can beat New York or Boston.<br />\nE: Well, I hope you're wrong anyway.<br />\nBROOKS; I hope I'm wrong too.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 141,1.1A RCH 17, 1978<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n:<br />\nPERFORMERS,<br />\ni<br />\nSCRIPTS,ACTORS I<br />\n1<br />\nNeeded For<br />\ni<br />\nI SPRING FAIR<br />\n1<br />\nTRAVELLING<br />\n[CHILDREN'S SHOWj<br />\n1<br />\nCONTACT:SteveBalog;<br />\nSAC Office Box 52 1<br />\nor 235-8599<br />\n<br />\n.111111111.041111M4<br />\n<br />\nSUN N FUN<br />\nSAVINqS<br />\nSTIR<br />\n<br />\nTIME<br />\nTO<br />\nCASh<br />\nIN<br />\n<br />\nZI3IN33)1008<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nSAViNgS<br />\nSUN F N FUN<br />\n<br />\n[Work Study Students!<br />\nand Volunteers<br />\nI desperately needed<br />\nto work in the<br />\nOffice of the<br />\nChaplain<br />\nI Stop by or call us at<br />\n338-8187<br />\n<br />\n\"I've gotPabst Blue Ribbon on my mind.\"<br />\n<br />\nPABST BREWING COMPANY.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nPeoria Heights.

They'll be cast as typical college students, of<br />\nthat time, when Thomas,just prior to his death in 1953 at<br />\nthe age of 39, made an enormously popular reading tour<br />\nof American campuses, among them Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThomas retained his popularity with college students<br />\ninto the 1960's, but now it's a safe bet that many<br />\nattending Sunday will have little or no familiarity with<br />\nthe Welsh poet. An outrageous, witty, self-destructive<br />\negoist who burned himself out at an early age, Thomas<br />\nhas been superseded in the 70's by the more modem<br />\nexample of the self-destructive poet, among them Sylvia<br />\nPlath and Anne Sexton. On many college campuses,<br />\nHopkins included, Plath's The Bell Jar far outsells any<br />\ncollection of Thomas' poetry.<br />\nEven as a child, Thomas was a rogue. Some of his<br />\nearliest poetry, for instance, published in a school<br />\nmagazine, was plagarized. Though biographers generally<br />\nagree that Thomas was an ordinary child, he exhibited<br />\nboth the mischief and wit that would later prove to be<br />\nhis doing and undoing. Between the ages of 15 and 19 he<br />\nwrote some two hundred poems in a series of notebooks.<br />\nAn indifferent student, Thomas rejected any advanced<br />\nformal education, saying that his real education consisted<br />\nof \"the liberty to read whatever I cared to\" of his father's<br />\nbooks. When not reading he usually committed petty<br />\ncrimes and outrageous pranks. A few examples: drinking<br />\nhis own urine to see what it tasted like; peering through a<br />\nkeyhole while a maid was taking a bath; stealing clothes<br />\nand personal objects from friends (something he would do<br />\n:even as he middle-aged, making him a somewhat less than<br />\nperfect house guest).<br />\n- Thomas tried journalism for a while, but neither the<br />\nSouth Wales Daily Post, nor Thomas himself, were<br />\n<br />\nDylan Thomas<br />\n<br />\nJK: They are in the book not because I have<br />\nknown them, but above all their presence in the novel is<br />\nbecause they can illustrate the ideas of this novel. I want<br />\nto say that the philosophy of George Levanter is<br />\nsomething which has a presence outside Levanter. That it<br />\nis a scientific philosophy.<br />\nCPS: You've written that Stalinism taught you that<br />\n\"writing is war\" and that the persecution of Soviet writers<br />\nimpressed upon you the writer's potential as a moral,<br />\npolitical and intellectual force. Do you ever feel any<br />\nnostalgia for the atmosphere of Eastern Europe, where<br />\nwriting is a more 'engaged' act?JK: That is why George<br />\nLevanter is an investor, or Tarden of Cockpit is an agent.<br />\nRoles which Americans perceive are more dramatic. But<br />\nthat is the only nostalgia that there is, other than clearly I<br />\nnever wanted to sever my roots. Eastern Europ e is<br />\nSwiftian. It is like Gulliver's land, in fact, where one small<br />\nman once traveled.<br />\nCPS: Is socialism Swiftian?<br />\nJK: In the last three years, I've come to see socialist<br />\nsocieties, so-called totalitarian societies, as an oppression<br />\nby the party simply in the absence of computers. The<br />\nideology becomes an ever-present computer. A crude<br />\ncomputer. It is actually a leveling device which IBM can<br />\nperform much better. A man in a totalitarian state is<br />\nhelpless. He or she feels that the total apparatus of society<br />\nis so much more powerful, eventful, so much more<br />\nequipped to deal with the destiny of the whole tribe.<br />\nThis corresponds, I think, to the helplessness felt by a<br />\nman or woman trapped in their four-wheel vehicle on a<br />\nhighway called freeway. It takes half of your life under<br />\nthe guise of rendering you free or adventurous. I think the<br />\npopular culture is the ideology of the computer, which<br />\ncreates the archetypal figures of heroes like Doris Day or<br />\nRock Hudson. While Marxism may be a crude computer,<br />\nthe computer state can do all this leveling not through the<br />\nparty's secretary, but through a computer card popping<br />\nout and saying you are above average, below average, you<br />\nhave to move iere or there. It discredits the common man<br />\nor woman by rendering them completely 'uneventful' and<br />\n.passive.<br />\nCPS: You once told your class at Yale that ,\"I'm not here<br />\nto save you, I'm not a missionary, I'm only trying to save<br />\nmyself from what has happened to you.\" Do you still<br />\nteach?<br />\nJK: I'm on leave since 1973 and I haven't gone back to<br />\nteaching.<br />\nCPS: Do you want to?<br />\nJK: Part of me wants to and part says no. It is too<br />\nprotective an environment. It shelters too much.<br />\n<br />\nJerzyKosinski:<br />\nIn Tense Place<br />\nFrom the College Press Service (CPS)<br />\n\u2022 The eyes, which used to terrorize the Gypsies, haven't<br />\nlost their ability to stun. About ten feet from where he sits<br />\nis a rack of objects called 'Hit Harold.' Harold is a tiny,<br />\ninflatable everyman, woose instructions suggest that he be<br />\nplaced on a convenient spot on your desk and beaten<br />\nwhenever life threatens to overwhelm. A kid, after five<br />\nminutes of pretending to shuffle, through a pile of<br />\nbirthday cards, walks over and lays a paperback in front<br />\nof him.\"That's probably one of the most unforgettable<br />\nbooks I've ever read.\"<br />\nJerzy Kozinski smiles at this copy of The Painted Bird.<br />\n\"It's so nice of you to say this. So few people actually say these things.\"<br />\nHis voice is soft and his English has the careful<br />\nenunciation of an acquired language. Kosinski fled Poland<br />\nwhen he was 24. Since then he has published five novels,<br />\nmost recently Blind Date. The atmosphere of the large<br />\ndepartment store clearly bores him. He sits there behind a<br />\ntable overflowing with copies of his book, waiting for<br />\nsomeone to engage him, surprise him, preferring a life<br />\nwhere \"a predictable environment\" becomes \"tense.\"<br />\nCPS: At the end of Blind Date, your protagonist,<br />\nGeorge Levanter, is told that his entire life has been a<br />\nblind date. Could Jerzy Kosinski be told the same thing?<br />\nJerzy Kosinski: Most of my generation did not believe in<br />\nany notion of destiny. We saw it discredited so often,<br />\nbetraying so many things, so that to all of us life was<br />\nbasically what you make of it as it comes by and it comes<br />\nby not in a plot, not ex cathedra, but it conies to you in<br />\nencounters with other people. It comes to you in the<br />\nmoment of self awareness. The crucial issue is the<br />\nmoment in which you can ponder all this, and this<br />\nShould<br />\nbe, ideally, every moment.

But he did perform well in<br />\nmaking himself an \"artist as a young dog,\" a role that<br />\nrequired, or at any rate soon resulted in, a great deal of<br />\nliquor, philosophic bull sessions with friends, homosexual<br />\nrelations and poetry. Any good young dog artist could<br />\nfind no happiness in the provinces, in Wales, so not<br />\nsurprisingly, Thomas moved to London and its bohemian<br />\ncircles, of which he wrote: \"This is the quarter of toe<br />\npseudo-artists, of the beards, of the naughty expressions<br />\nof an entirely out-moded period of artistic importance<br />\n<br />\nand of the most boring bohemian parties I have ever<br />\nthought possible.\"<br />\nHe made friends with the poetic powers of tne day,<br />\namong them Edith Sitwell, whose support had a lot to do<br />\nwith Thomas' increasing popularity in the late 1930's. 18<br />\nPoems and Twenty-Five Poems, published in the middle<br />\nthirties, contain some of his finest poetry. Indeed, by<br />\n1936 Thomas had written around half of his Collected<br />\nPoems.<br />\nA \"relentless performer,\" in the words of Paul Ferris,<br />\nThomas' most recent biographer (who also wrote the BBC<br />\ndocumentary), the poet and his performances gradually<br />\nbecame more important than the poetry. Not only did<br />\nThomas write less, but lie found it more difficult to write:<br />\n\"My table's !leaped with odd lines, single words, nothing<br />\ncompleted.\" His small income became even smaller as his<br />\nappetites became larger. The solution? America, of<br />\ncourse. That's what brought him to Hopkins and other<br />\ncolleges. Once on the lecture tour, ne found it financially<br />\nrewarding if nothing else. American students and<br />\nprofessors adored him, but he cared neither for them nor<br />\ntheir schools. Writing to his wife Caitlin he complained:<br />\n\"I never seem to sleep in a bed anymore, only on planes<br />\nand trains. I'm hardly living; I'm just a voice on<br />\nwheels...Day after day I grow lazier and fatter and sadder<br />\nand older and deafer and duller...I renounce my Art to<br />\nmake money then make no money.\"Novelist John Barth,<br />\nthen a Hopkins student, has called these misadventures<br />\nThomas'\"last two postmortem trips to America.\"<br />\nWriting little and drinking much, Thomas was a<br />\nburnt-out man long before the age of forty. The legend of<br />\nDylan Thomas, largely a creation of Thomas himself,<br />\ncontinued to grow after his death. Well-groomed, decent,<br />\nmiddle-class college .students everywhere made of this<br />\nbohemian figure one of their favorite poets, not so much<br />\non the basis of his poetry as on the basis of his life.<br />\nCertainly his life does read well.

One is that they consciously embrace<br />\nnotions of destiny inherited from the culture and their<br />\nparents. That is how it manifests itself. It manifests itself<br />\nin the inability to grasp oneself as a truly dramatic<br />\nprotagonist in one's own life, in the dramatic units of this<br />\nlife as it comes by and the university should certainly be a<br />\ndramatic incident in the course of one's life.

Robinson laid aside his glove.<br />\nWhen most baseball fans tnink of Brooks Robinsoii,<br />\nthey conjure in their minds the following short movie: a<br />\nman in a slightly baggy Oriole uniform a few feet back of<br />\nthe infield grass near tnird, nis knees tensely bent just a<br />\nlittle, his right nand poised within tile pocket of his glove,<br />\nhis eyes fixed. plateward. Instantaneously, he becomes<br />\nairborne, horizontal, and spears a line drive, a<br />\nwould-be single or double. Tne batter, the disbelieving<br />\nvictim of this heist, screeches to a frustrated stop halfway<br />\ndown the first baseline.<br />\nThe drama on which this movie is based ran a good<br />\ntwenty years in ballparks all over tile U.S.A. Even until<br />\nthe end of his career, tile Human Vacuum Cleaner kept up<br />\nthis thievery of base hits, and baseball observers,<br />\nparticularly younger tiiird basemen, continued to shake<br />\ntheir heads in wonder. It seems strange to think that we<br />\nwill no longer witness tne uncanny acrobatics of Brooks<br />\nRobinson. All we can do now is run that movie, over and<br />\nover, in our minds. In late February, I talked who<br />\nRobinson, a gracious and friendly man, in his downtown<br />\noffice wiiere iie does public relations work for Crown<br />\nCentral Petroleum Corporation. This year in addition to<br />\nhis work at Crown, ne'll be providing color commentary<br />\nfor the locally-televised Oriole games. \"And,\"Robinson<br />\nadds, \"I'll be spending some time at home. That's what I<br />\nreally want.\"<br />\nERCOLANO: How did you first become interested in<br />\nbaseball?<br />\nBROOKS: I never really did anything else as far as I can<br />\nremember but play ball. I've always been interested in it,<br />\nand my Dad encouraged me to play. He played a lot of<br />\nsemi-pro ball aroeild Little Rock. I went to the same high<br />\nschool as he did, and I kind of followed in his footsteps. I<br />\njust always !lad an interest in ball and played on as many<br />\nteams as I could Wnen I was growing up.<br />\nE: You played in high school too?<br />\nBROOKS: I didn't play nigh school baseball;they didn't<br />\nhave high school baseball in Arkansas. But toe last four<br />\nyears before I signed, I played American Legion baseball.<br />\nBefore that I played Midget League which is similar to tne<br />\nLittle League, and Junior League which is similar to the<br />\nPony League. I played for two or three clubs and spent a<br />\nlot of time around the LaMar Porter Field in Little Rock<br />\nwhere everything happened. I went to grammar school<br />\nright across the street from there and I used to work out<br />\nthere. They had a lot of baseball and Fast-Pitch Softball<br />\ngames. E: As a yuungster, did you have any sports heroes?<br />\nBROOKS: My hero growing up was always Stan Musial.<br />\nSt. Louis was the closest big-league team to Little Rock<br />\nand we'd pick up some of the games oil radio, so I kind of<br />\nfollowed Stan Musial. He was my idol as a youngster.<br />\nE: When did you decide mat you were going to make<br />\nyour career out of baseball?<br />\nBROOKS: I always thought I was going to make a career<br />\n'out of it as long as I can remember, even going back to<br />\nwhen I was a kid, twelve, thirteen years old. I thought for<br />\nsure I was going to be a big-league baseball player. Maybe<br />\nthat was taking a lot for granted, but I never wanted to do<br />\nanything else. I wrote a booklet in the eighth grade on<br />\n\"My Vocation,\" and I wrote mine on being a professional<br />\nbaseball player, so my wnole life was kind of geared<br />\naround that. I didn't play football in nigh school because<br /><br />\nI didn't want to take a cliance on getting hurt. I ran track<br />\njust to get in shape for baseball. Baseball was the only<br />\nthing I ever wanted to do.<br />\nE: If it weren't for baseball, what other line of wort_<br />\nmight you have gone into?<br />\nBROOKS: Well, I nad<br />\nscholarships to several schools to play basketball. I really<br />\ndon't know what I would nave done, toough. My interest<br />\nreally was baseball. I would probably be living in Arkansas<br />\nsome wnere. But if I didn't play baseball or sign<br />\nprofessionally in 1955, I would've gone to the University<br />\nof Arkansas on a basketball scholarship.<br />\nE: You seemed to have a Knack for brilliant performances<br />\nin big games, like All-Star games, World Series, etc. Did<br />\nyou get more psyched for Mose games?<br />\nBROOKS: I don't know if I got psyched but mere is a<br />\ndifferent feeling involved when you play in an All-Star<br />\ngame or a playoff or a World Series. In baseball you play<br />\nso many games, you very seldom get excited about a ball<br />\ngame because it's like a job, day in, day out. It's not like<br />\nplaying once a week in football where everything builds<br />\nup to that one day, and if you're not really ready<br />\nphysically or mentally, you just get blown rigiit out of the<br />\nball park. But in baseball it's an entirely different<br />\napproach, because you are playing every day and your<br />\nbody just doesn't respond to getting all hyped-up every<br />\ntime you run onto the field. When you have an All-Star<br />\ngame or a World Series, you really do feel it inside and<br />\nlike the old cliche says, the adrenalin starts to flow. Ws a<br />\ngood feeling to have. It doesn't mean you're going to<br />\nperform well because I've felt like that and I played lousy<br />\nand I've felt like that and played pretty good. But I<br />\nbelieve that every player likes to feel that when the chips<br />\nare down, when the money's on the table, ne can perform<br />\nbest of all. Like I said, under those circumstances I played<br />\npretty bad and other times I played pretty good. But I<br />\nthink every athlete likes to think he can do it when it's<br />\nreally needed.<br />\nE:Of all the big moments of your career, is there one that<br />\nthere one tnat stands out?<br /><br />\na great iustinct for the game. Kaline, Mantle, getting a<br />\nchance to play against Clemente mien he was in his<br />\nprime...those names come to mind more than others.<br />\nYazstremski too. Arid I played against Mays and AarOflaj<br />\nand it was a big thrill. I got to see Ted Williams win al.<br />\nbatting championship. I played against him a couple Of ji<br />\nyears. In his last game at Fenway Park, Williams nit<br />\nhome run in his last time at bat. I was in that game. I saw<br />\nMickey Mantle come off tile bench after being injured for<br />\na long time and he hit a pinch-hit home run to win 3<br />\ngame. Things like that come back to you.<br />\nE: Could you come up with an All-Star team, position by<br />\nposition, based on the players you've seen over the past<br />\ntwenty years?<br /><br />\nz<br /><br />\nBROOKS: I think that playing in my first World Series in<br />\n1966 was my biggest thrill, mainly because as a youngster<br />\nyou always look forward to signing, hen getting into the<br />\nbig leagues, then winning the pennant and getting to the<br />\nSeries, and being world champions. For that reason, I<br />\nlook at the '66 Series as my big moment in the game.<br />\nE: In the first game ot the '66 Series in LA,after you and<br />\nFrank Robinson nit back-to-back home runs in the first<br />\ninning, what were your feelings as you ran around tile<br />\nbases alter your home run?<br />\nBROOKS: Oh, tnat was just unbelievable, the first time<br />\nup to hit back-to-back home runs, Frank and Brooks. I<br />\nlike to think that's what turned the tide of the whole<br />\nSeries, tnat kind of snocked them right there.<br /><br />\nBROOKS: Not really. I ilaven't really sat down and done<br />\nthat. But I don't know anybody who played shortstop as<br />\nwell as Mark Belanger. Luis Aparicio and Belanger, I just<br />\nput them in a class by themselves, defensively. I don't<br />\nthink I saw anybody play as good a second base as Bobby ,<br />\nGrich did tiie year he set the record for fewest errors by'''<br />\nsecond baseman. Paul Blair was the best centerfielder<br />\nsaw. So I think I played with some guys who rank right ...I<br />\nthe top of my book for going after tile ball and catching<br />\nthe ball. These, guys were just the best tilere were.<br />\nE: What's your opinion of baseball today? Has it bee<br />\ncheapened by all the mingling over money?<br />\nBROOKS: What's happened over the past two years. W ith<br />\neverybody having a chance to become great, has beer<br />\ntotally unfair to the owners, but they really brought it or<br />\nthemselves by not working out a reserve system that<br />\nwould be fair and equitable to both sides. We now haveal<br />\nsystem that starts tiiis year wilich I think is fair to the I<br />\nowners and the players. It simply states that when You<br />\nsign with a team, they'll send you to the minor leagues<br />\nand then you are obligated to that organization for si%<br />\nyears. After six years, you've an option wiiether you want<br />\nto stay with tnat ball club or go play somewhere else. .<br />\nI think that what's happening in sports is just a sigh'\u00b0I<br />\nthe times. With the society we live in,pay is not based on<br />\nthe importance of your job. If that were the Case'<br />\nentertainers and athletes would be at the bottom of t11<br />\nheap. We live in a society that's fun-seeking alniA<br />\nsports-oriented, and in this society, athletes all<br />\nentertainers profit more than anybody else. So I can't get<br />\nupset when I see athletes get the money toey're getting<br />\nbecause I look at it in relation to now tnach moncY is<br />\ngenerated by sports. It's not how important your job is'<br />\nWe generate a lot of money and we are to share ill<br />\nWhen an entertainer makes $100,000 in one night, peoPte<br />\nseem to take that pretty easy. But when they see 31:<br />\nathlete make $200,000 or $300,000 a year, they ge<br />\npretty uptight about toat.<br />\nE:Besides the money situation, how has the game challgej<br />\nsince you broke in?<br /><br />\nE. Of all the awards you've won, is there one more special<br />\nthan the rest?<br />\nBROOKS: I think that winning the Hickok Belt in 1970<br />\nfor my performance in the World Series was certainly the<br />\nnicest--well, not the nicest, but certainly the most<br />\nlucrative award I had ever won. I think the MVP award in<br />\n1964 was the best one I received because it was for<br />\nsomething that was sustained over the wilole year, not<br />\njust for a four or five game series.<br />\nE: Whom do you rate as some of the best players you've<br />\nplayed with and against?<br />\nBROOKS:: Certainly Frank Robinson in Baltimore was<br />\none of tile all-time great players I played with. He just Had<br /><br />\nBROOKS: The game has not changed much between 1111.:<br />\nlines. There have been a few changes which I think If%<br />\nhelped the game. I toink the designated hitter has beell4<br />\nplus. The astroturf is not going to cnange the game %ee<br />\n'<br />\nl<br />\nmuch. Most of the people who go to the games like t\u00b0 re<br />\naction. They like seeing more hits, more doubles, 111\u00b0,,e<br />\nist<br />\ntriples, more runs, and with the astroturf and'<br />\ndesignated hitter, you're going to see all these things. rid`.0<br />\nof the changes have come outside of the game itself,\u00b0Iv<br />\nthe owners and the players and the negotiations and Ito<br />\nplayers' union. Another change is taut they're gotog<br />\nmore specialties, such as the relief pitcher, the i)1J1<br />\n'<br />\nid<br />\nrunner, the designated runner, but overall, baseball'\"<br /><br />\nson S ca s<br />\nall professional sports, are just booming now. I've been<br />\nhearing for the past fifteen years, \"We're going to kill the<br />\ngoose that laid the golden egg. Baseball is on a<br />\ndownswing.\" But last year more people went through tile<br />\nturnstiles than ever before, even if you don't count the<br />\ntwo new expansion teams. I think there is. a saturation<br />\npoint with all tile free agents and so on, but will' tills new<br />\nSystem titat we nave now, we're going to get back to a<br />\nlittle normalcy.<br />\nE: Do you think the quality of the players has changed<br />\nmuch through<br />\npast 20 years?<br />\nBROOKS: I ti., the quality of the players is about the<br />\nsame. With all the multi-year contracts being passed<br />\naround, Liere might be a tendency with some players to<br />\nplay when they feel like it. The majority are certainly<br />\ngoing to be out there every day, playing no matter what<br />\nkind of money they're making. You are going to have an<br />\nattitude among some guys like,\"I've got a headache, or a<br />\nhangnail. I'm not going to play today.\"<br />\nE: Everyone has an opinion of Bowie Kuhn. What's<br />\nyours?<br />\nwith<br />\nBROOKS: Well, Bowie has been faced<br />\never<br />\nbeen<br />\nhas<br />\ncommissiOner<br />\nfaced<br />\nother<br />\ndecisions that no<br /><br />\nWith, but I don't think he's really been consistent with a<br />\nlot of the things that he's done. I don't think he had the<br />\nright to tell Charlie Finley that he couldn't sell so-and-so.<br />\nThat wouldn't have been so detrimental to baseball, as he<br />\nwould say.<br />\nE: Do you think Kuhn should be fired?<br />\nBROOKS: Well, Bowie is in a good position; he just<br />\nsighed a seven-year contract or something, so if the<br />\nowners say they want to fire him, he'll say go ahead and<br />\nfire me, because ne knows he's going to get paid. See, tile<br />\nCommissioner really \u2022ilas been the tool of the owners.<br />\nThey're the ones that nire him, they're the ones that fire<br />\nhim, they're the ones that tell nim what to do. I'm<br />\ndisappointed in him for not stepping in before we got to<br />\nthis one-and-one situation (where players sign one-year<br />\nContracts and the. next year become free agents). He<br />\nShould've said to the owners,\"Hey, work something out<br />\nWith the players.\" He didn't do . that and I'm very<br />\nd isappointed that that didn't happen, otherwise we<br />\nwouldn't have been in the situation we've had the past two<br />\nYears with the free agents. He is at the whim of the<br />\n?vvners. If they're paying him $150,000 a year, believe me,<br />\nIi Certain situations he.is not going to go against the<br />\no wners., And lie knew what was right for baseball. He<br />\nshould nave stepped in and said, \"Hey, work something<br />\nout with these guys.\" Instead, the owners said to him,<br />\n,Hey, shut up and sit down over there. We pay your<br />\ns`darY and we're going to tell you what to do.\" You can't<br />\nPlease all the owners. He went ahead and made some<br />\n(lecisions that he felt were in the best interests of baseball.<br />\nINli<br />\n.at's why we're having all this conflict now.<br />\nt..<br />\n_s Spring training starts this week in Miami for the<br />\nloles. What are your feelings when you think this is the<br />\nIirst time in over 20 years that you'll miss spring training?<br /><br />\n4\u00b01<br /><br />\nset<br /><br />\n1011<br /><br />\nlost<br /><br />\nwit)<br />\ntile<br /><br />\n1<br />\n7<br /><br />\nJIVA<br />\n101'<br /><br />\nthkOOKS:This is the first time in 22 years that I didn't go<br />\ni\u00b0 spring training. But it's been a ctazy transition because<br />\nA don't have any desire to put the uniform on again. I<br />\nuon't even think about going tO Florida or playing, and I<br />\nthink it probably stems from last year. Sitting and<br />\niw.atching the games took it all out of me. I mean, I just<br />\nye to play and when I stopped playing, that was it for<br />\nC. I had enough and I don't have any desire to put the<br />\n,niform on again, or be a coach or a manager. I have a<br />\n\"e.stre sometimes to be a college coach, and I think I<br />\night pursue that. Maybe in a few years, I don't know.<br /><br />\nThat would be the only way I would ever do anything in<br />\nbaseball again as far as on the field activities are<br />\nconcerned.<br />\nE: When approximately did you make the decision to<br />\nretire?<br />\nBROOKS: I would say during the last half of last season<br />\nwhen realizing that a lot of the young guys were going to<br />\ndo the job and we were going to win a lot of games. If the<br />\nyoung guys hadn't played well and we hadn't nad such a<br />\ngood start, then I think I would have played a lot last<br />\nyear. But the young guys were doing the job so I figured<br />\nI'd never be playing again. I could've winked it out to go<br />\nto a few other places for a year, but it really wasn't<br />\nworthwhile for me to pick up and go to Seattle (I talked<br />\nto them), Toronto or Pittsburgh. If! could have worked it<br />\nout for a couple of years, I'd probably have gone ahead,<br />\nbecause I wanted to play and I thought I could play.<br />\nE: How difficult was it for you to make that decision-to<br />\n' retire?<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBROOKS: It really wasn't difficult. I just kind of lost<br />\ninterest last year and my priorities changed when I wasn't<br />\nplaying. I just thought, well, this is ridiculous being on the<br />\nroad all the time, not being nome, and you're not really<br /><br />\naccomplishing any<br />\nSo I couldn't have been nap pier<br />\nwhen it was all over. I never thought it would be Mat way<br />\nbut that's how it happened.<br />\nE: When you turned 30, did you look ahead and say, \"I'm<br />\ngoing to play so many more years, then retire,\" or were<br />\nyou going to make . that decision when the time<br />\ncomes?<br />\nBROOKS: I- said I was going to play as long as I could,<br />\nand I thought they'd probably have to tear the uniform<br />\noff me because I enjoyed playing, the money was great,<br />\nand all the things that went along with being a ballplayer<br />\nwere just everything I dreamed of and better., I just made<br />\nup my mind that I'd play as long as I could, but when it<br />\nstopped being fun or I wasn't playing that'd be it.<br />\nE:In a recent SPORTING NEWS article, some baseball<br />\nwriter claimed that you might not get elected:into the Hall<br />\nof Fame for a couple of tries, or that you might not get<br />\nelected at all, because you're not well known in the<br />\nNational League and you didn't hit .300 lifetime. Did you<br />\nsee that?<br />\nBROOKS: Well, I don't put much faith in that guy. That<br />\nwas Bill Broeg that wrote that and I think he's all wet. I<br />\nnever thought too much about the Hall of Fame until I<br />\nretired, and everybody said to me, well, in five years,<br />\nyou're going to be elected. If I had to put my money on<br />\nit, I think I'll get elected the first time around.(Laughs)<br />\nMaybe not. You're asking me, I don't know. I tell you, I<br />\ndon't even know what it takes to get elected to tne Hall<br />\nof Fame, and that's how closely I follow it. I don't<br />\nknow who votes; I know it takes a certain percentage to<br />\nget elected. But anyway I read that article. My answer to<br />\nhim is that he never really got to see me play either, so<br />\nwho knows?<br />\nE; Who was your favorite manager?<br />\nBROOKS:'think Paul Richards, and Earl Weaver. They're<br />\nboth different from tne usual run of managers.,They both<br />\nrun the game well. I thought Paul Richards was God really<br />\nwhen I signed; then he actually was the guy managing<br />\nwhen I came up. Weaver came along and Earl just seemed<br />\nto have the knack. He's just like a little bantam rooster,<br />\nrunning around doing this and that. I got a lot of laughs<br />\nout of him, but he runs the game very well. Time biggest<br />\nthing in managing is getting the respect of the players,and<br />\nalso being able to handle your pitching staff. But you've<br />\ngo to have the horses. You can be the greatest manager in<br /><br />\n\u2022 the world, but if you don't have the horses, you're not<br />\ngoing to win.<br />\nE; Do you think Weaver is the managerial genius he's<br />\nreputed to be?<br />\nBROOKS: I think he's a good manager, yeah. I think he<br />\nruns the game well. The Orioles in the past 21 years have<br />\nwon more games than anyone in either league which I<br />\nthink is a pretty significant fact. We've just had good<br />\nplayers that Earl's been able to handle. He received his<br />\njust due this past year (the Manager of the Year Award).<br />\nEight years ago we were winning all those games, people<br />\njust said, well, Earl should win, he's got the players.<br />\nBut last year nobody really thought we had that good a<br />\nclub. He was named manager of the year, and rightly so.<br />\nWe played as well as we could last year and I think he got<br />\nthe maximum out of everybody.<br />\nE: What do. you think of Frank Robinson's getting a<br />\ncoaching job with the Orioles?<br />\nBROOKS: That's a good thing. Frank and Earl really nave<br />\na good rapport.' think it's good to have somebody to lean<br />\non sometime or to ask a '')w questions of. And Frank's a<br />\ngood baseball man. He's .dedicat,%1 and he wants to be in<br />\nthe game for the rest or his life as a coach or a manager.<br />\nThere's really no pressure, no friction, because Earl<br />\nWeaver can get some job anyplace he wants to. It's not<br />\none of those things. where Frank's- going to be looking<br />\nover his shoulder because I think everybody realizes that<br />\nEarl is going to be around for a while and that he's the<br />\nboss. Frank can add a lot of things to,the ball club_ and<br />\nhe'll help since Weaver lost George Bamburger and Billy<br />\nHuntcr.<br />\nE: You're sure you wouldn't want to coach or manage in<br />\nthe majors some day?<br />\nBROOKS: No, I have no desire to put the uniform on<br />\nagain. I never will. I'm sure of that.<br />\nE: Have you gotten baseball. out of your system? If so, do<br />\nyou think you'll get the bug again?<br />\nBROOKS: No, I don't think I'll ever get the bug again.<br />\nThis really has been one of tile most exciting times of life<br />\nfor me, this whole transition, because everything before<br />\nthis was just cut and dry. You knew you had to be here<br />\nand be there. The last six months, my wife and I have had<br />\nto sit down and talk over a lot of things, which we never<br />\nhad to do before. We had to make decisions, on different<br />\njob offers I've mid and it's just been kind of an interesting<br />\nthing to go through. I just don't. want to go down and<br />\nwork as liard as I've worked, as far as getting in shape is<br />\nconcerned.- I've -just had enough baseball. That's hard to<br />\nbelieve, because I -never thought I'd be sitting nere saying<br />\nthat. I thought I'd always be willing to go, go, go baseball.<br />\nBut I have no desire to do that anymore. /<br />\nE: I thought I'd ask an expert. What's the best way to<br />\nbreak in a new glove?<br />\nBROOKS: I've seen guys break them in many ways. The<br />\nonly way I've broken in one is just to play in it. Take it<br />\nout and use it. I had two or three gloves; one I used in a<br />\ngame, the other two I'd use. during infield practice or<br />\nplaying catch. I've never broken a glove in any other way<br />\nexcept just playing with it and using it. I'd always try to<br />\ndocto\u2018 it up, take out the heel and make it a little flatter.<br />\nI've seen some guys like Aparici and Clint Courtney<br />\ntake their \u2022gloves, put a ball in, it, wrap it up in two or<br />\nthree big rubber bands. Then 'they'd soak it overnight,<br />\ntake it out, and let it hang for about a month. When they<br />\nopened it up, they'd have a nice pocket in there. But most<br />\n,of the gloves today are pretty well broken in when you<br />\nbuy them.<br />\nE:How do you think- the Orioles will .do this year?<br />\nBROOKS: I think the Orioles are going to have a good<br />\nyear. They're going to win a lot of games. I don't tilink<br />\nthey're going to be able to match New York and Boston.<br />\nNew York and Boston nave more talent than the Orioles.I<br />\nreally feel we played potentially as good as we could last<br />\nyear. We've got some good players, but I don't see how<br />\nwe can beat New York or Boston.<br />\nE: Well, I hope you're wrong anyway.<br />\nBROOKS; I hope I'm wrong too.<br /><br />\nPAGE 141,1.1A RCH 17, 1978<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n:<br />\nPERFORMERS,<br />\ni<br />\nSCRIPTS,ACTORS I<br />\n1<br />\nNeeded For<br />\ni<br />\nI SPRING FAIR<br />\n1<br />\nTRAVELLING<br />\n[CHILDREN'S SHOWj<br />\n1<br />\nCONTACT:SteveBalog;<br />\nSAC Office Box 52 1<br />\nor 235-8599<br /><br />\n.111111111.041111M4<br /><br />\nSUN N FUN<br />\nSAVINqS<br />\nSTIR<br /><br />\nTIME<br />\nTO<br />\nCASh<br />\nIN<br /><br />\nZI3IN33)1008<br /><br />\nr<br />\nI<br /><br />\nSAViNgS<br />\nSUN F N FUN<br /><br />\n[Work Study Students!<br />\nand Volunteers<br />\nI desperately needed<br />\nto work in the<br />\nOffice of the<br />\nChaplain<br />\nI Stop by or call us at<br />\n338-8187<br /><br />\n\"I've gotPabst Blue Ribbon on my mind.\"<br /><br />\nPABST BREWING COMPANY.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nPeoria Heights.

They'll be cast as typical college students, of<br />\nthat time, when Thomas,just prior to his death in 1953 at<br />\nthe age of 39, made an enormously popular reading tour<br />\nof American campuses, among them Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThomas retained his popularity with college students<br />\ninto the 1960's, but now it's a safe bet that many<br />\nattending Sunday will have little or no familiarity with<br />\nthe Welsh poet. An outrageous, witty, self-destructive<br />\negoist who burned himself out at an early age, Thomas<br />\nhas been superseded in the 70's by the more modem<br />\nexample of the self-destructive poet, among them Sylvia<br />\nPlath and Anne Sexton. On many college campuses,<br />\nHopkins included, Plath's The Bell Jar far outsells any<br />\ncollection of Thomas' poetry.<br />\nEven as a child, Thomas was a rogue. Some of his<br />\nearliest poetry, for instance, published in a school<br />\nmagazine, was plagarized. Though biographers generally<br />\nagree that Thomas was an ordinary child, he exhibited<br />\nboth the mischief and wit that would later prove to be<br />\nhis doing and undoing. Between the ages of 15 and 19 he<br />\nwrote some two hundred poems in a series of notebooks.<br />\nAn indifferent student, Thomas rejected any advanced<br />\nformal education, saying that his real education consisted<br />\nof \"the liberty to read whatever I cared to\" of his father's<br />\nbooks. When not reading he usually committed petty<br />\ncrimes and outrageous pranks. A few examples: drinking<br />\nhis own urine to see what it tasted like; peering through a<br />\nkeyhole while a maid was taking a bath; stealing clothes<br />\nand personal objects from friends (something he would do<br />\n:even as he middle-aged, making him a somewhat less than<br />\nperfect house guest).<br />\n- Thomas tried journalism for a while, but neither the<br />\nSouth Wales Daily Post, nor Thomas himself, were<br /><br />\nDylan Thomas<br /><br />\nJK: They are in the book not because I have<br />\nknown them, but above all their presence in the novel is<br />\nbecause they can illustrate the ideas of this novel. I want<br />\nto say that the philosophy of George Levanter is<br />\nsomething which has a presence outside Levanter. That it<br />\nis a scientific philosophy.<br />\nCPS: You've written that Stalinism taught you that<br />\n\"writing is war\" and that the persecution of Soviet writers<br />\nimpressed upon you the writer's potential as a moral,<br />\npolitical and intellectual force. Do you ever feel any<br />\nnostalgia for the atmosphere of Eastern Europe, where<br />\nwriting is a more 'engaged' act?JK: That is why George<br />\nLevanter is an investor, or Tarden of Cockpit is an agent.<br />\nRoles which Americans perceive are more dramatic. But<br />\nthat is the only nostalgia that there is, other than clearly I<br />\nnever wanted to sever my roots. Eastern Europ e is<br />\nSwiftian. It is like Gulliver's land, in fact, where one small<br />\nman once traveled.<br />\nCPS: Is socialism Swiftian?<br />\nJK: In the last three years, I've come to see socialist<br />\nsocieties, so-called totalitarian societies, as an oppression<br />\nby the party simply in the absence of computers. The<br />\nideology becomes an ever-present computer. A crude<br />\ncomputer. It is actually a leveling device which IBM can<br />\nperform much better. A man in a totalitarian state is<br />\nhelpless. He or she feels that the total apparatus of society<br />\nis so much more powerful, eventful, so much more<br />\nequipped to deal with the destiny of the whole tribe.<br />\nThis corresponds, I think, to the helplessness felt by a<br />\nman or woman trapped in their four-wheel vehicle on a<br />\nhighway called freeway. It takes half of your life under<br />\nthe guise of rendering you free or adventurous. I think the<br />\npopular culture is the ideology of the computer, which<br />\ncreates the archetypal figures of heroes like Doris Day or<br />\nRock Hudson. While Marxism may be a crude computer,<br />\nthe computer state can do all this leveling not through the<br />\nparty's secretary, but through a computer card popping<br />\nout and saying you are above average, below average, you<br />\nhave to move iere or there. It discredits the common man<br />\nor woman by rendering them completely 'uneventful' and<br />\n.passive.<br />\nCPS: You once told your class at Yale that ,\"I'm not here<br />\nto save you, I'm not a missionary, I'm only trying to save<br />\nmyself from what has happened to you.\" Do you still<br />\nteach?<br />\nJK: I'm on leave since 1973 and I haven't gone back to<br />\nteaching.<br />\nCPS: Do you want to?<br />\nJK: Part of me wants to and part says no.

About ten feet from where he sits<br />\nis a rack of objects called 'Hit Harold.' Harold is a tiny,<br />\ninflatable everyman, woose instructions suggest that he be<br />\nplaced on a convenient spot on your desk and beaten<br />\nwhenever life threatens to overwhelm. A kid, after five<br />\nminutes of pretending to shuffle, through a pile of<br />\nbirthday cards, walks over and lays a paperback in front<br />\nof him.\"That's probably one of the most unforgettable<br />\nbooks I've ever read.\"<br />\nJerzy Kozinski smiles at this copy of The Painted Bird.<br />\n\"It's so nice of you to say this. So few people actually say these things.\"<br />\nHis voice is soft and his English has the careful<br />\nenunciation of an acquired language. Kosinski fled Poland<br />\nwhen he was 24. Since then he has published five novels,<br />\nmost recently Blind Date. The atmosphere of the large<br />\ndepartment store clearly bores him. He sits there behind a<br />\ntable overflowing with copies of his book, waiting for<br />\nsomeone to engage him, surprise him, preferring a life<br />\nwhere \"a predictable environment\" becomes \"tense.\"<br />\nCPS: At the end of Blind Date, your protagonist,<br />\nGeorge Levanter, is told that his entire life has been a<br />\nblind date. Could Jerzy Kosinski be told the same thing?<br />\nJerzy Kosinski: Most of my generation did not believe in<br />\nany notion of destiny. We saw it discredited so often,<br />\nbetraying so many things, so that to all of us life was<br />\nbasically what you make of it as it comes by and it comes<br />\nby not in a plot, not ex cathedra, but it conies to you in<br />\nencounters with other people. It comes to you in the<br />\nmoment of self awareness. The crucial issue is the<br />\nmoment in which you can ponder all this, and this<br />\nShould<br />\nbe, ideally, every moment. Hence I consider<br />\nmyself on a blind date from the time I was six years old.<br />\nAnd certainly by the time I was 12 I was convinced that<br />\nthe only form life takes, the only meaningful form, is the<br />\nblind date.<br />\nCPS: Blind Date appears almost to be a roman a clef.<br />\nJacques Monod, Henry Kissinger, Charles Lindbergh all<br />\nappear...<br /><br />\nsatisfied with his performance. But he did perform well in<br />\nmaking himself an \"artist as a young dog,\" a role that<br />\nrequired, or at any rate soon resulted in, a great deal of<br />\nliquor, philosophic bull sessions with friends, homosexual<br />\nrelations and poetry. Any good young dog artist could<br />\nfind no happiness in the provinces, in Wales, so not<br />\nsurprisingly, Thomas moved to London and its bohemian<br />\ncircles, of which he wrote: \"This is the quarter of toe<br />\npseudo-artists, of the beards, of the naughty expressions<br />\nof an entirely out-moded period of artistic importance<br /><br />\nand of the most boring bohemian parties I have ever<br />\nthought possible.\"<br />\nHe made friends with the poetic powers of tne day,<br />\namong them Edith Sitwell, whose support had a lot to do<br />\nwith Thomas' increasing popularity in the late 1930's. 18<br />\nPoems and Twenty-Five Poems, published in the middle<br />\nthirties, contain some of his finest poetry. Indeed, by<br />\n1936 Thomas had written around half of his Collected<br />\nPoems.<br />\nA \"relentless performer,\" in the words of Paul Ferris,<br />\nThomas' most recent biographer (who also wrote the BBC<br />\ndocumentary), the poet and his performances gradually<br />\nbecame more important than the poetry. Not only did<br />\nThomas write less, but lie found it more difficult to write:<br />\n\"My table's !leaped with odd lines, single words, nothing<br />\ncompleted.\" His small income became even smaller as his<br />\nappetites became larger. The solution? America, of<br />\ncourse. That's what brought him to Hopkins and other<br />\ncolleges. Once on the lecture tour, ne found it financially<br />\nrewarding if nothing else. American students and<br />\nprofessors adored him, but he cared neither for them nor<br />\ntheir schools. Writing to his wife Caitlin he complained:<br />\n\"I never seem to sleep in a bed anymore, only on planes<br />\nand trains. I'm hardly living; I'm just a voice on<br />\nwheels...Day after day I grow lazier and fatter and sadder<br />\nand older and deafer and duller...I renounce my Art to<br />\nmake money then make no money.\"Novelist John Barth,<br />\nthen a Hopkins student, has called these misadventures<br />\nThomas'\"last two postmortem trips to America.\"<br />\nWriting little and drinking much, Thomas was a<br />\nburnt-out man long before the age of forty. The legend of<br />\nDylan Thomas, largely a creation of Thomas himself,<br />\ncontinued to grow after his death. Well-groomed, decent,<br />\nmiddle-class college .students everywhere made of this<br />\nbohemian figure one of their favorite poets, not so much<br />\non the basis of his poetry as on the basis of his life.<br />\nCertainly his life does read well. Paul Ferris' biography is<br />\nproof of that. But don't forget the poetry. And if you<br />\nslick back your hair or don bobby socks on Sunday in<br />\nShriver you can be witness to both.<br />\nCPS:What is the disease the American student is suffering<br />\nfrom?<br />\nJK: Two things. One is that they consciously embrace<br />\nnotions of destiny inherited from the culture and their<br />\nparents. That is how it manifests itself. It manifests itself<br />\nin the inability to grasp oneself as a truly dramatic<br />\nprotagonist in one's own life, in the dramatic units of this<br />\nlife as it comes by and the university should certainly be a<br />\ndramatic incident in the course of one's life. If you<br />\ncombine these two notions, you get a condition of<br />\npassivity, partly unaware, because there is not much that<br />\none could or should do. Tnat I find to traumatizing to<br />\nwitness:<br />\nCPS: Wnat you said sounds just like mid-twentieth<br />\ncentury existentialism.<br />\nJK: Here I would kindly, no, unkindly, disagree. I think<br />\nthis philosophy is the very opposite of existentialism. In<br />\nfact my philosophy, George Levanter's philosophy, and<br />\nthat of my other characters stresses the moment to be<br />\nextended, to be lived, claiming that the moment contains<br />\nall principle ingredients to one's connection to life.
