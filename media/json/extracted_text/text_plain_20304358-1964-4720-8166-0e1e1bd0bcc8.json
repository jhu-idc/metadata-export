This may be<br />\nin part because this is the first<br />\nnotice which has been received<br />\nfrom the Honor Commission in<br />\nyears despite the fact that its<br />\nConstitution requires that it<br />\ndeliver all results of its trials to<br />\nthe News-Letter for printing.<br />\nFounded upon the concept<br />\nthat no gentleman will take<br />\n\"unfair advantage\" of his peers,<br />\nthe Honor Code is intended to<br />\ndeal with the problems of<br />\ncheating and other<br />\nungentlemanly behavior by the<br />\nstudents of the University.<br />\nIn recent years, the Code<br />\nand the Honor Commission<br />\nwhich enforces it, faced with<br />\nsevere criticism from some<br />\nstudents, have declined in<br />\nprestige.<br />\nCriticism has been aimed<br />\nchiefly at practices which<br />\nstudents believe to be<br />\nunconstitutional or<br />\nunrepresentative.<br />\nThe Honor Commission was<br />\n<br />\ndecision by the commission has<br />\never been reversed by the Dean.<br />\nStudents found guilty of an<br />\nHonor Code violation are<br />\npunished according to the<br />\nseriousness of the violation.

Also, the<br />\nCommission requires that the<br />\ndefense counsel retain ultimate<br />\nresponsibility to the<br />\nCommission, and is bound to<br />\nreveal all he learns regarding the<br />\nguilt of the student.<br />\nSome students have<br />\ncomplained that this is an<br />\ninfringement upon the<br />\n<br />\ndefendant's legal rights.

Vogt said that in<br />\nyears past, fraternities made<br />\nefforts to get as many people on<br />\nthe commission as possible.<br />\nThis interest has declined<br />\nrecently however and this year<br />\nthe Commission seats only about<br />\nfive fraternity men.

The two<br />\nundergraduate \"representatives\" on the committee were<br />\nsupposed to be carefully screened and selected by the<br />\nStudent Council, but are just temporary members instead,<br />\nreportedly mere friends of one SC representative. Yet their<br />\nsuggestions are crucial to the makeup of the S600,000<br />\naddition to Levering Hall. Leaders of major campus<br />\norganizations were given one session to project their needs,<br />\nand polling of students was passed up in favor of two<br />\npoorly-publicized hearings slated for next week. According<br />\nto an administration member of the committee, the group<br />\nis more interested in speed than in what he termed \"strict<br />\nadherence to the democratic system.\" The hearings next<br />\nweek amount to a last chance for students to have any say<br />\non what is destined to be a major influence on campus life.<br />\nThe planning committee appears to be following the<br />\nvenerable Hopkins tradition of making policy unhampered<br />\nby student influence. In this particular case, the<br />\nadministration has once again established the pretense of<br />\nstudent input\u2014the shop-worn committee system\u2014without<br />\nbothering to give students an active voice in the planning<br />\nof what is billed as a Student Union. After this month, it<br />\nshould be known as The Architect Union.<br />\n<br />\nCoffee and conversation<br />\nIt is not very hard to make life more enjoyable for<br />\nHopkins students. This has been proven recently by one<br />\nundergraduate student and a group of graduate students.<br />\nLast year, Vincent Forte, then a junior, decided that two<br />\nyears of being at Hopkins and never seeing faculty<br />\nmembers outside of the classroom (and never seeing administrators at all) was enough. So he organized the Campus Conversations, a rather simple affair that involved<br />\nbringing one faculty member or administrator each week<br />\nto the dormitory social lounge to converse with students in<br />\nan informal atmosphere. The idea was so successfull, yet so<br />\nsimple that one wondered why it hadn't been done before.<br />\nForte began the second year of Campus Conversations<br />\nlast week, and once again it seems to be a worthy addition<br />\nto the undergraduates' life, which will enable many students, especially dormitory freshmen, to meet the faculty<br />\nmembers and administrators who have a great deal of say<br />\nabout their life at Hopkins.<br />\nThis year, a group of graduate students have undertaken<br />\nto replace some of the charm the Macke vending machines<br />\ntook from Levering Hall by setting up a coffee house in<br />\nthe lobby of Gilman. Hopefully, this will provide a place<br />\nto go and have a cup of coffee and perhaps a snack, with<br />\nan enjoyment that just isn't possible with automat-like<br />\nmachines staring in your face.<br />\nThese two ventures are modest undertakings that can<br />\nreally make a difference to students. It is notable that our<br />\nadministration has not had the imagination to initiate such<br />\nthings.<br />\n<br />\nIRATE,INDIGNANT<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWhat is optimism, Vince, but<br />\na subtle shading of the facts?

As a<br />\nfreshman, I cannot understand<br />\nyour courting of the<br />\nAdministration, your<br />\nconciliation, your desire to<br />\nmaintain a conspicuously low<br />\nprofile until the Law Committee<br />\nsends out its recommendations.<br />\nImagine me, a freshman,<br />\nworking to improve<br />\nundergraduate education with<br />\ntactless articles, unschooled in<br />\ndeference and politesse.

The<br />\nfirst was a short \"Dance and<br />\nInvocation\" by Paul Ben Haim,<br />\nan Israeli composer who is partly<br />\ninfluenced by Semitic, Arabic<br />\nand Yemenite folk music, and<br />\nPartly by his studies at the<br />\nMunich Academy of Music. The<br />\nDance was a very tight piece,<br />\n<br />\nconducted during the past two<br />\nyears, he has shown a<br />\nremarkable knowledge of several<br />\ntime periods in history. He has<br />\nwritten in seven different<br />\nlanguages\u2014all verified by<br />\nexperts.<br />\nThe writings have ranged from<br />\nEgyptian hieroglyphs, which the<br />\nDepartment of Egyptian and<br />\nSemetic languages at a<br />\nWashington, D.C. University,<br />\nsaid were \"very well done\" to<br />\nmodern Italian.<br />\nOther writings include<br />\nclassical Greek, Norman,<br />\nIdiomatic Latin, what he claims<br />\nis \"Atlantean,\" and Aramaic.<br />\nYet records received from<br />\nKalvin's Philadelphia high school<br />\nshow that he failed first year<br />\nLatin\u2014miserably.<br />\n<br />\ntonally, and very complex, sort<br />\nof alive and full of energy. The<br />\nending brought on a burst of<br />\napplause and four curtain calls,<br />\nthough Ben-Haim's piece was a<br />\ntense one, leaving you on the<br />\nedge of your seat wondering if<br />\nthat was how it was supposed to<br />\nsound.<br />\nAfter some rearrangement of<br />\nthe orchestra for the Violin<br />\nConcerto Mr. Commissiona<br />\nbegan the first movement of<br />\nSchumann's work (vigorous, but<br />\nnot too fast) with energy.<br />\nHenryk Szeryng played the solo<br />\nviolin, setting the tone for the<br />\nother strings, while the director<br />\ndid an excellent job of keeping<br />\nthe other 'sections in rythm and<br />\ncontrolling the intricate weaving<br />\nof the violin solo with minute<br />\nfluorishes of his hands.<br />\nThe second movement<br />\n(slowly) formed a bridge and<br />\nbrought on a barrage of<br />\npizzicato in the accompanying<br />\nstrings as well as a fine vibrato in<br />\nthe soloist runs. It happened too<br />\nquickly; the beauty passed away<br />\nbefore you got into it, and then<br />\nthe third movement began,<br />\nseemingly a mite too fast,<br />\nperhaps in reaction to the<br />\nslowness of the preceding one.<br />\nMr. Szeryng was leading the<br />\norchestra somewhat<br />\ncontrapuntally, though it wasn't<br />\nintended that way, and it came<br />\nas a surprise to all.<br />\nConcerto<br />\nThe finest piece of the night<br />\nfollowed the intermission: A<br />\nConcerto for two violins in A<br />\nMinor by Vivaldi, with Szeryng<br />\non one violin and a Mr. Saslav on<br />\nthe other.<br />\nAllegro was the name of the<br />\ngame for the first movement.<br />\nHere, the orchestra well proved<br />\ntheir capability of following an<br />\nallegro lead and this movement<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nhad what might be called a<br />\n\"swinging beat.\" The second<br />\nmovement had a devotional<br />\ntone, and Vivaldi's priestly<br />\nleanings were very much in<br />\nevidence here. The last<br />\nmovement, also an allegro, made<br />\nuse of a harpsichord along with<br />\nthe two main violins, backed up<br />\nby the basses which led in to the<br />\nintermittent scale descents and<br />\nreturns to the thematical chorus;<br />\na beautifully executed melody.<br />\nThe Vivaldi piece brought a very<br />\nenthusiastic reaction from the<br />\naudience, and the musicians also<br />\nlooked pleased, showing their<br />\nappreciation for the well-done<br />\nlead.<br />\nShocked<br />\nThe last piece was a ballet<br />\nSuite by Prokofieff, \"Chout\" or<br />\nthe Buffoon. It contained some<br />\nviolently contrasting music and<br />\nwas obviously chosen by<br />\nCommissiona to leave the<br />\naudience somewhat shocked.<br />\nThe music was clashing, jarring<br />\nand dissonant, but it included<br />\nmelodies of great purity. The<br />\nflutes and oboes were graphic in<br />\ntheir recounting of the events<br />\nwhich befell the buffoons, the<br />\nstrings set the many moods<br />\nwhich constantly alternated<br />\nfrom mellifluous to violent, and<br />\nthe xylophones and French<br />\nhorns did justice to Prokofieffs<br />\ndesire to jangle the audience's<br />\nnerves, making them understand<br />\nthe sadistic mockery of the plot.<br />\nSergiu Commissiona is a fiery<br />\nand uninhibited director who is<br />\nobviously very dedicated to his<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe Baltimore Sympliory<br />\nOrchestra, a good body of<br />\nmusicians under good direction,<br />\npromises to build on the success<br />\nof their first two concerts and<br />\nprovide a good season of<br />\nclassical music.<br />\n<br />\nKalvin said his father in the<br />\nprevious life, Charles Vincey,<br />\nwas buried in the Holy Rood<br />\nChurchyard on the east side of<br />\nHigh street in Southampton.

The Club,<br />\nwhich is located in the basement<br />\nof McCoy Hall (right across from<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Library),<br />\nwas moderately filled with small<br />\ngroups of graduate men and<br />\nwomen who were talking<br />\nquietly, though enthusiastically,<br />\nover beer and peanuts. The<br />\njukebox was broken, no one was<br />\nnoticeably drunk, and there was<br />\nan obvious reduction in the<br />\nnumber of gradmen actively<br />\ntrying to pick up girls. A sign<br />\nforbidding firearms was<br />\nprominently posted on the door.<br />\nCheap Beer<br />\nPart of the Grad Club's<br />\npopularity is due to its cheap<br />\nbeer, which ranges in price from<br />\n30-50 cents. Bud and Colt 45,<br />\nfor example, are 40 cents a<br />\nbottle while Michelob is 50<br />\ncents. Orders placed for French<br />\nfries and cheeseburgers keep the<br />\nkitchen cowbell ringing fairly<br />\ncontinuously, notifying<br />\ncustomers when their orders are<br />\nready.<br />\nWhen the jukebox is working,<br />\nthe Graduate Club is a fairly<br />\nfriendly and relaxing place to go.<br />\nOpen until 1 a.m. on week<br />\nnights and 2 a.m. on weekends,<br />\nthe biggest influx of people<br />\n3. \u2022.\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.\u2022\u2022\u2022,<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022<br />\n-A../\u2022a\u2022.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 Allo\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\narrive between 10:30 p.m. and<br />\nmidnight.

Although the game won't<br />\nfigure in the MAC standings, the<br />\ncontest will be packed with<br />\nsentimental value for both sides.<br />\nWhen the Blue Jays last met<br />\nthe Hoyas in their 1920 finale,<br />\nWarren G. Harding was bidding<br />\nto succeed Woodrow Wilson as<br />\nPresident, and United States<br />\nmembership in the League of<br />\nNations was a political hot<br />\npotato. A 28-7 Georgetown<br />\nvictory dropped HopkinS to a<br />\n4-5 season mark, but three of<br />\nthose losses were to such powers<br />\nas Virginia (14-0), Maryland<br />\n(24-7), and Syracuse (45-6). For<br />\nthe record, the Blue Jay victories<br />\nwere over St John's (41-0),<br />\nWestern Maryland (49-0), Mt. St.<br />\nMary's (49-0), and of course<br />\nHaverford (17-10\u2014Perhaps<br />\nthings haven't changed that<br />\nmuch in 51 years after all).<br />\nFootball Power<br />\nThe Hoyas, once themselves a<br />\nfootball power, dropped the<br />\nsport in 1950. Several years ago<br />\nthe school reinstated football on<br />\na \"club\" basis and in 1970 began<br />\nscheduling varsity teams once<br />\nagain. Tomorrow's encounter<br />\nwill represent the first contest<br />\nagainst collegiate opposition at<br />\nGeorgetown since 1950.<br />\nThe Hoyas are 2-1 on the 1971<br />\nseason and by no means should<br />\nbe taken lightly. Georgetown<br />\nopened its campaign with a 69-6<br />\ntrouncing of hapless Catholic<br />\nUniversity before dropping a<br />\n24-6 decision to powerful<br />\nJuniata. Last week the Hoyas<br />\ngot back on the victory trail by a<br />\n33-14 count over Manhattan.<br />\nGeorgetown features a<br />\nsomewhat unusual wrinkle in<br />\nboasting three military veterans<br />\nin its starting lineup. Halfback<br />\nRalph Edwards, backbone of the<br />\nHoyas ground game, is a 26-year<br />\nold freshman and an ex-Marine<br />\nas well. The two other oldsters<br />\ninclude sophomore defensive<br />\nend Bill Brugger, 24, and<br />\nman-mountain defensive tackle<br />\nAlexander Hampshire (5'11\",<br />\n270 pounds), 26. Hopkins Head<br />\nCoach Dennis Cox characterizes<br />\ntomorrow's opposition as<br />\n\"basically a running ream\" and<br />\n<br />\n\"defensively very aggressive.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays, on the other<br />\nhand, showed themselves to be<br />\nnobody's patsy in last Saturday's<br />\n60-0 laugher over Haverford. In<br />\nnotching their second straight<br />\nvictory for rookie Coach Cox<br />\nafter two opening losses, the Blue<br />\nJays chalked up their highest<br />\npoint total since 1931, when<br />\nHopkins closed out the year by<br />\nrolling over American<br />\nUniversity, 61-0. The count,<br />\nhowever, fell far short of the<br />\nschool's alltime record, an 87-0<br />\nrout of nearby Loyola in the<br />\nfinale of the 1924 season.<br />\nIncidentally, the worst loss in<br />\nthe history of the school was a<br />\n108-0 thrashing at the hands of<br />\nPrinceton in 1885 that,<br />\ncuriously enough, came on the.<br />\nheels of a 12-8 Blue Jay triumph<br />\nover Navy. Hopkins didn't face<br />\nthe Tigers again until 1888 and<br />\nlost, 104-0).<br />\nCox was elated at having<br />\ncome \"pretty close to a perfect<br />\ngame\" against the Red Wave.<br />\nCornerback Harry Stringer, who<br />\nintercepted two passes and<br />\nfound time to run for a score on<br />\noffense, took the honors as the<br />\noutstanding defensive performer<br />\nalong with \"fritz\" linebacker<br />\nCraig Stevens. Right tackle Mike<br />\nMalloy drew considerable praise<br />\nfor helping to spring halfback<br />\nButch Robey loose for much of<br />\nhis 141 yards. Robey, who<br />\nplayed for only 21<br />\n/<br />\n2 quarters, has<br />\nrolled up 280 yards in the last<br />\ntwo games and now has a shot at<br />\nOz Garcia's season-high mark of<br />\n931 yards set in 1959.<br />\nNew Record<br />\nQuarterback Jack Thomas<br />\nenjoyed another excellent all<br />\naround performance. Cox<br />\npointed with pride to Thomas'<br />\nimproved kicking efforts, which<br />\nhave come on strong after a slow<br />\nstart. Thomas averaged 40 yards<br />\non his only two punts, booted a<br />\n32-yard field goal, and kicked<br />\nseven points after touchdown to<br />\nset a new Blue Jay record. The<br />\nold standard of five kicked<br />\nconversions was set by Yank<br />\nSamberg against Susquehana in<br />\n1952 and tied fifteen years later<br />\nby the fabled Joe Cowan against,<br />\nwho else, Haverford.<br />\nThe Blue Jays received help<br />\nfrom an unexpected source on<br />\nSaturday.

Rupert<br />\ndetailed his plans thus: \"We're<br />\ngoing to run more this year.<br />\nbecause, with our added height,<br />\nwe're going to get more<br />\nrebounds. I'll tell my starters to<br />\nplay as hard as they can for as<br />\nlong as they can. When they get<br />\ntired, I'll substitute. In fact, I'll<br />\nprobably have two separate<br />\nteams. With fresh ballplayers in<br />\nthere, we'll apply more pressure<br />\non defense. We may even go to a<br />\nfull court press.\"<br />\nRupert is worried about two<br />\nthings. He is concerned<br />\nprincipally about his team's<br />\ninexperience. \"We're young and<br />\nwe'll have to grow up this year<br />\nin order to win.

The two<br />\nundergraduate \"representatives\" on the committee were<br />\nsupposed to be carefully screened and selected by the<br />\nStudent Council, but are just temporary members instead,<br />\nreportedly mere friends of one SC representative. Yet their<br />\nsuggestions are crucial to the makeup of the S600,000<br />\naddition to Levering Hall. Leaders of major campus<br />\norganizations were given one session to project their needs,<br />\nand polling of students was passed up in favor of two<br />\npoorly-publicized hearings slated for next week. According<br />\nto an administration member of the committee, the group<br />\nis more interested in speed than in what he termed \"strict<br />\nadherence to the democratic system.\" The hearings next<br />\nweek amount to a last chance for students to have any say<br />\non what is destined to be a major influence on campus life.<br />\nThe planning committee appears to be following the<br />\nvenerable Hopkins tradition of making policy unhampered<br />\nby student influence. In this particular case, the<br />\nadministration has once again established the pretense of<br />\nstudent input\u2014the shop-worn committee system\u2014without<br />\nbothering to give students an active voice in the planning<br />\nof what is billed as a Student Union.

This has been proven recently by one<br />\nundergraduate student and a group of graduate students.<br />\nLast year, Vincent Forte, then a junior, decided that two<br />\nyears of being at Hopkins and never seeing faculty<br />\nmembers outside of the classroom (and never seeing administrators at all) was enough. So he organized the Campus Conversations, a rather simple affair that involved<br />\nbringing one faculty member or administrator each week<br />\nto the dormitory social lounge to converse with students in<br />\nan informal atmosphere.

It happened too<br />\nquickly; the beauty passed away<br />\nbefore you got into it, and then<br />\nthe third movement began,<br />\nseemingly a mite too fast,<br />\nperhaps in reaction to the<br />\nslowness of the preceding one.<br />\nMr. Szeryng was leading the<br />\norchestra somewhat<br />\ncontrapuntally, though it wasn't<br />\nintended that way, and it came<br />\nas a surprise to all.<br />\nConcerto<br />\nThe finest piece of the night<br />\nfollowed the intermission: A<br />\nConcerto for two violins in A<br />\nMinor by Vivaldi, with Szeryng<br />\non one violin and a Mr. Saslav on<br />\nthe other.<br />\nAllegro was the name of the<br />\ngame for the first movement.<br />\nHere, the orchestra well proved<br />\ntheir capability of following an<br />\nallegro lead and this movement<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nhad what might be called a<br />\n\"swinging beat.\" The second<br />\nmovement had a devotional<br />\ntone, and Vivaldi's priestly<br />\nleanings were very much in<br />\nevidence here. The last<br />\nmovement, also an allegro, made<br />\nuse of a harpsichord along with<br />\nthe two main violins, backed up<br />\nby the basses which led in to the<br />\nintermittent scale descents and<br />\nreturns to the thematical chorus;<br />\na beautifully executed melody.<br />\nThe Vivaldi piece brought a very<br />\nenthusiastic reaction from the<br />\naudience, and the musicians also<br />\nlooked pleased, showing their<br />\nappreciation for the well-done<br />\nlead.<br />\nShocked<br />\nThe last piece was a ballet<br />\nSuite by Prokofieff, \"Chout\" or<br />\nthe Buffoon.

The<br />\nflutes and oboes were graphic in<br />\ntheir recounting of the events<br />\nwhich befell the buffoons, the<br />\nstrings set the many moods<br />\nwhich constantly alternated<br />\nfrom mellifluous to violent, and<br />\nthe xylophones and French<br />\nhorns did justice to Prokofieffs<br />\ndesire to jangle the audience's<br />\nnerves, making them understand<br />\nthe sadistic mockery of the plot.<br />\nSergiu Commissiona is a fiery<br />\nand uninhibited director who is<br />\nobviously very dedicated to his<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe Baltimore Sympliory<br />\nOrchestra, a good body of<br />\nmusicians under good direction,<br />\npromises to build on the success<br />\nof their first two concerts and<br />\nprovide a good season of<br />\nclassical music.<br /><br />\nKalvin said his father in the<br />\nprevious life, Charles Vincey,<br />\nwas buried in the Holy Rood<br />\nChurchyard on the east side of<br />\nHigh street in Southampton.

Harding<br />\n46.40.issok<br />\nipsorze u<br />\nAO\"<br /><br />\nA%<br /><br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br />\nA myriad of long-forgotten<br />\nnostalgic memories from a<br />\ndeeply buried past will live again<br />\ntomorrow afternoon when the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University<br />\nfootball squad travels to<br />\nWashington to take on<br />\nGeorgetown University at 2:00<br />\npm. Although the game won't<br />\nfigure in the MAC standings, the<br />\ncontest will be packed with<br />\nsentimental value for both sides.<br />\nWhen the Blue Jays last met<br />\nthe Hoyas in their 1920 finale,<br />\nWarren G. Harding was bidding<br />\nto succeed Woodrow Wilson as<br />\nPresident, and United States<br />\nmembership in the League of<br />\nNations was a political hot<br />\npotato. A 28-7 Georgetown<br />\nvictory dropped HopkinS to a<br />\n4-5 season mark, but three of<br />\nthose losses were to such powers<br />\nas Virginia (14-0), Maryland<br />\n(24-7), and Syracuse (45-6). For<br />\nthe record, the Blue Jay victories<br />\nwere over St John's (41-0),<br />\nWestern Maryland (49-0), Mt. St.<br />\nMary's (49-0), and of course<br />\nHaverford (17-10\u2014Perhaps<br />\nthings haven't changed that<br />\nmuch in 51 years after all).<br />\nFootball Power<br />\nThe Hoyas, once themselves a<br />\nfootball power, dropped the<br />\nsport in 1950. Several years ago<br />\nthe school reinstated football on<br />\na \"club\" basis and in 1970 began<br />\nscheduling varsity teams once<br />\nagain. Tomorrow's encounter<br />\nwill represent the first contest<br />\nagainst collegiate opposition at<br />\nGeorgetown since 1950.<br />\nThe Hoyas are 2-1 on the 1971<br />\nseason and by no means should<br />\nbe taken lightly. Georgetown<br />\nopened its campaign with a 69-6<br />\ntrouncing of hapless Catholic<br />\nUniversity before dropping a<br />\n24-6 decision to powerful<br />\nJuniata. Last week the Hoyas<br />\ngot back on the victory trail by a<br />\n33-14 count over Manhattan.<br />\nGeorgetown features a<br />\nsomewhat unusual wrinkle in<br />\nboasting three military veterans<br />\nin its starting lineup. Halfback<br />\nRalph Edwards, backbone of the<br />\nHoyas ground game, is a 26-year<br />\nold freshman and an ex-Marine<br />\nas well. The two other oldsters<br />\ninclude sophomore defensive<br />\nend Bill Brugger, 24, and<br />\nman-mountain defensive tackle<br />\nAlexander Hampshire (5'11\",<br />\n270 pounds), 26. Hopkins Head<br />\nCoach Dennis Cox characterizes<br />\ntomorrow's opposition as<br />\n\"basically a running ream\" and<br /><br />\n\"defensively very aggressive.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays, on the other<br />\nhand, showed themselves to be<br />\nnobody's patsy in last Saturday's<br />\n60-0 laugher over Haverford. In<br />\nnotching their second straight<br />\nvictory for rookie Coach Cox<br />\nafter two opening losses, the Blue<br />\nJays chalked up their highest<br />\npoint total since 1931, when<br />\nHopkins closed out the year by<br />\nrolling over American<br />\nUniversity, 61-0. The count,<br />\nhowever, fell far short of the<br />\nschool's alltime record, an 87-0<br />\nrout of nearby Loyola in the<br />\nfinale of the 1924 season.<br />\nIncidentally, the worst loss in<br />\nthe history of the school was a<br />\n108-0 thrashing at the hands of<br />\nPrinceton in 1885 that,<br />\ncuriously enough, came on the.<br />\nheels of a 12-8 Blue Jay triumph<br />\nover Navy. Hopkins didn't face<br />\nthe Tigers again until 1888 and<br />\nlost, 104-0).<br />\nCox was elated at having<br />\ncome \"pretty close to a perfect<br />\ngame\" against the Red Wave.<br />\nCornerback Harry Stringer, who<br />\nintercepted two passes and<br />\nfound time to run for a score on<br />\noffense, took the honors as the<br />\noutstanding defensive performer<br />\nalong with \"fritz\" linebacker<br />\nCraig Stevens. Right tackle Mike<br />\nMalloy drew considerable praise<br />\nfor helping to spring halfback<br />\nButch Robey loose for much of<br />\nhis 141 yards. Robey, who<br />\nplayed for only 21<br />\n/<br />\n2 quarters, has<br />\nrolled up 280 yards in the last<br />\ntwo games and now has a shot at<br />\nOz Garcia's season-high mark of<br />\n931 yards set in 1959.<br />\nNew Record<br />\nQuarterback Jack Thomas<br />\nenjoyed another excellent all<br />\naround performance. Cox<br />\npointed with pride to Thomas'<br />\nimproved kicking efforts, which<br />\nhave come on strong after a slow<br />\nstart. Thomas averaged 40 yards<br />\non his only two punts, booted a<br />\n32-yard field goal, and kicked<br />\nseven points after touchdown to<br />\nset a new Blue Jay record. The<br />\nold standard of five kicked<br />\nconversions was set by Yank<br />\nSamberg against Susquehana in<br />\n1952 and tied fifteen years later<br />\nby the fabled Joe Cowan against,<br />\nwho else, Haverford.<br />\nThe Blue Jays received help<br />\nfrom an unexpected source on<br />\nSaturday. Cox found himself<br />\n\"very impressed with the play of<br />\nthe substitutes,\" who rolled up<br />\nthe final points of the rout.<br />\nFreshman second quarterback<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nRick Kramer showed he could<br />\nmove the team too, running<br />\nthree yards for the final tally.<br />\nThe kickoff team, anchored by<br />\nfreshman Ken Tashiro, garnered<br />\na lot of valuable experience and<br />\nplayed an instrumental role in<br />\nshutting out the Fords. By<br />\nconsistently stopping most of<br />\nthe nine Haverford runbacks shy<br />\nof the 20, the Blue Jay defensive<br />\nunit found itself without a lot of<br />\nthe pressure that it had had to<br />\nweather in previous games.<br /><br />\nCox feels that the use of the<br />\nreserves \"has started to get us<br />\nsome depth,\" and believes that<br />\nhis training every player at two<br />\npositions, one offensive and one<br />\ndefensive, has obviated the need<br />\nto shift personnel around. He<br />\nadded that except for the loss of<br />\nsafety Tim Weglicki (knee<br />\nsurgery), \"we've been very<br />\nfortunate as far as injuries are<br />\nconcerned.\" Even then, Grant<br />\nShevchik and Les Matthews have<br />\nbeen doing an excellent job of<br /><br />\n-*<br />\nfilling in.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will be playing<br />\ntomorrow without the services<br />\nof tackle Jim Adams, who is<br />\nrecuperating from eye surgery<br />\nfor an injury sustained against<br />\nFranklin and Marshall.<br />\nDepth<br />\nLive WJHU (830 AM) air<br />\ncoverage from Washington<br />\nbegins at 1:45 tomorrow<br />\nafternoon.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nspoRTs<br />\nThinclads Lose Third<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nThe Blue Jay cross-country<br />\nteam dropped its third loss<br />\nagainst two victories, by losing<br />\nto Gettysburg, 22-35 last<br />\nTuesday afternoon.<br />\nOnce again, Russ Dubiel took<br />\nfirst place with a tithe of 27:26<br />\non the 5.1 mile course. Russ, the<br />\ntop runner on the team and only<br />\na sophomore, has now taken<br />\nfirst place in four of the Jays'<br />\nfirst five meets, taking third<br />\nplace against Drexel last<br />\nSaturday. But one man does not<br />\nwin a meet.<br />\nUnfortunately, the rest of the<br />\nteam did not perform as well,<br />\nwith second man Jeff Greve only<br />\ntaking fifth place with a time of<br />\n28:22.<br />\nOther men placing for<br />\nHopkins were Dave Piccoli, who<br />\nfinished eighth with a time of<br />\n30:10, and sophomore Ira Luke,<br />\nwho captured tenth place with a<br />\ntime of 30:21.<br />\nDespite the large difference<br />\nbetween the times of Hopkins'<br />\nfinishers, there was reason for<br />\nsome optimism at the end of the<br />\nmeet.<br />\nPromising Aspect<br />\nOne of the more promising<br />\naspects of the meet was the<br />\nperformance of Luke, who has<br />\nsteadily improved throughout<br />\nthe first five meets. According to<br />\nCoach Masken, the team<br /><br />\ndesperately needs a runner to<br />\ntake up the slack created by an<br />\ninjury to the team's third best<br />\nrunner, Austin Doyle.<br />\nFurthermore, Masken implies<br />\nthat Luke might just be the one<br />\nto do this.<br />\nWinning Is Hard<br />\nAs he commented,\"Ira might<br />\njust be one of our top runners<br />\nnear the end of the season,<br /><br />\nthough it will be mighty hard to<br />\nfind a replacement for Doyle or<br />\neven injured co-captain Ed<br />\nCummings (who is probably out<br />\nfor the season).

Rupert<br />\nbelieves that Jews \"has the<br />\nability to make money out of<br />\nthe game if he is willing to work<br />\nat it.\" Despite a year of idleness<br />\nthat has sent Jews to practicing<br />\nfundamentals, Rupert describes<br />\nhim as a good outside shooter<br />\nand an excellent leaper.<br />\nThe abundance of talent<br />\npresent on this year's team has<br />\ncaused the coach to refashion<br />\nthe Jays' style of play. Rupert<br />\ndetailed his plans thus: \"We're<br />\ngoing to run more this year.<br />\nbecause, with our added height,<br />\nwe're going to get more<br />\nrebounds. I'll tell my starters to<br />\nplay as hard as they can for as<br />\nlong as they can. When they get<br />\ntired, I'll substitute. In fact, I'll<br />\nprobably have two separate<br />\nteams. With fresh ballplayers in<br />\nthere, we'll apply more pressure<br />\non defense. We may even go to a<br />\nfull court press.\"<br />\nRupert is worried about two<br />\nthings. He is concerned<br />\nprincipally about his team's<br />\ninexperience. \"We're young and<br />\nwe'll have to grow up this year<br />\nin order to win. Even so, we'll be<br />\nbetter than last year. Other<br />\nteams will be also.\"<br />\nRupert seems more anxious,<br />\nthough, about his far from easy<br />\n23 game (8 home, 15 away)<br />\nschedule which includes games<br />\nagainst the Naval Academy and<br /><br />\nBy BRUCE BORTZ<br />\nExcept for a few familiar<br />\nfaces, the Blue Jay basketball<br />\nteam for the upcoming 1971-72<br />\nseason will bear little<br />\nresemblance to last year's squad.<br />\nNow completing its first week<br />\nof practice, the varsity squad (of<br />\nsecond year coach Gary Rupert)<br />\nwill be immeasurably<br />\nstrengthened by the addition of<br />\nfour of last year's freshmen team<br />\nstandouts: Bobby Friedman<br />\n(high scoring guard), Doug<br />\nCampbell ( a surprisingly good<br />\nshot at forward), John Rutter (a<br />\nfine shooting guard) and Chuck<br />\nLaBerge (a 6'6\" center-forward).<br />\nThese four sophmores will join<br />\nvarsity returnees Gary<br />\nHandelman, the team's senior<br />\ncaptain, David Kay, the unsung<br />\nhero of last year, according to<br />\nRupert, _Allan Schreiber,<br />\nhas slimmed down and improved,<br />\nand Clark Daggett, who is<br />\nPresently shooting the eyes out<br />\nof the basket.<br />\nLacking Interest<br />\nMissing from the ranks of<br />\nreturning veterans are seniors<br />\nGeorge Apple and Hal Grinberg.<br />\nBoth informed Rupert at<br />\nschool's start that they lacked<br />\nthe same 1 00% interest in<br />\nbasketball they evinced in<br />\nprevious seasons and had<br />\ndecided not to play this year.\"I<br />\nvery much respect them for their<br />\nhonesty\" commented Rupert.<br />\n\"We will miss their experience.\"<br />\nThe man who could well<br />\nmake Rupert forget Apple and<br />\nGrinberg is 6'7\" sophomore Bill<br />\nJews, an All-American forward<br />\nfrom Cambridge, Maryland who<br /><br />\nthe University of Virginia.<br />\nVirginia, in particular, is a<br />\ntop-notch team. The coach<br />\nbelieves that his team'iwill learn a<br />\ngreat deal from playing the<br />\nCavaliers. \"We won't be<br />\nembarassed by anyone\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nThe team's battle in the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference title<br />\nwill hinge on its performance<br />\nagainst six teams: Muhlenberg,<br />\nLebanon Valley, Ursinus,<br />\nDickinson, Moravian, and<br />\nFranklin and Marshall.<br />\nThe Jays will play these games<br />\nin the space of 24 days (January<br />\n29-February 21). No MAC<br />\nopponent will be a pushover.<br />\nOne of Rupert's problems is<br />\nnot really a problem at all. He'll<br />\nhave to decide who will play at<br />\nwhich position. \"I'm not sure<br />\nwhere Kay and Jews will be<br />\nplaying. If Kay can contain the<br />\nopposition's center, I'll use Jews<br />\nat forward, where he'll be in a<br />\ngood rebounding position,\"<br />\nRupert suggested.<br />\nThe team will meet pre-season<br />\ncompetition in late November<br />\nwhen they take on CCB and<br />\nPhiladelphia Textile.

The deep lines in<br />\nhis face, from his nostrils down<br />\nto his chin, stayed in place<br />\ndespite the obvious emotion the<br />\nsubject kindled in his. \"The<br />\nmost important thing we can do<br />\nis to end the war,\" he said.<br /><br />\nCut Military<br />\n\"When we have done that,<br />\nwe've got to go much further<br />\nand cut the vastly inflated<br />\nmilitary budget,\" he stated. He<br />\nmaintains that the military<br />\nbudget could be cut by<br />\ntwo-thirds, enhancing rather<br />\nthan diminishing our national<br />\nsecurity.<br />\n\"Our security now rests on<br />\nthe very slender margin of the<br />\nbalance of terror, in which we<br /><br />\ncompete with the Russians in<br />\nproducing lethal weapons<br />\nsystems which, if loosed, could<br />\ndestroy each other in a matter of<br />\nhours. There is no peace, no<br />\nhope in that kind of folly.\"<br />\nThe chances for speedy<br />\nchange, however, don't look too<br />\npromising to Gruening.<br />\nHe suggests mobilizing behind<br />\npeace candidates. He suggests<br />\ngoing to demonstrations. Above<br />\nall, he suggests working within<br />\nthe system.<br />\n\"Unfortunately, I don't see<br />\nany alternative. There is no<br />\nalternative in violence. Violence<br />\nis completely counter-productive.\"<br />\n\"We want to get back to the<br />\nAmerica that we loved and<br />\nadmired . . . we want a<br />\ngovernment whose word we can<br />\ntrust ... we want to restore<br />\ngovernment to the people, and<br />\nit's been taken away.\"<br />\nFaith in System<br />\nHis complete faith in the<br /><br />\nsystem has been reinforced by<br />\nmany years of public service,<br />\nwhich ended when he lost the<br />\nprimary election in Alaska in<br />\n1968. Even the living room of<br />\nhis suburban home reflects this<br />\ncommitment to the political<br />\nsystem; clusters of chairs and<br />\nsofas lend the feeling of sharp<br />\npolitical debate to an otherwise<br />\nstaid and quiet room.<br />\nSearching within the system<br />\nfor a solution to the Vietnam<br />\ndilemma, Gruening looks to the<br />\ncoming elections, calling for a<br />\ncandidate whose position is<br />\n\"clear, clean and honorable.\" In<br />\nhis opinion, Senator George<br />\nMcGovern is the best of several<br />\ncandidates who fit that<br />\ndescription.<br />\nWhile looking for a<br />\npresidential candidate to restore<br />\nfaith in the Executive, Gruening<br />\nalso chastized Nixon for failing<br />\nto advance qualified nominees<br />\nfor appointment to the Supreme<br />\nCourt, another branch of the<br />\nsystem. \"If Nixon can pack this<br />\ncourt, as he is already doing,<br />\nthen we may have a Supreme<br />\nCourt that will destroy our<br />\nliberties,\" he said.<br />\nEmphasizing that the<br />\nresponsibility for action rests on<br />\nall branches of government, he<br />\nsaid, \"The Congress has<br />\nshamefully betrayed its<br />\nresponsibility.\" He<br />\nrecommended that citizens<br />\ncheck the voting records and<br />\nsupport the \"honorable men\" in<br />\nthe congress who voted to let<br />\nthe draft expire in June, 1971.<br />\n\"Congress has the power of<br />\nthe purse; making speeches<br />\nagainst the war and voting for<br />\nmilitary appropriations is a<br />\ncontradiction. President Johnson<br />\nhimself once twitted the<br />\nCongress by saying, 'I don't care<br />\nwhat speeches you make as long<br />\nas you vote for my<br />\ntppropriations.'\"<br />\nNixon Ignores<br />\nNixon, according to Gruening,<br /><br />\nErnest Gruening<br />\nhas assumed more power than<br />\nGruening pointed out, since<br />\nany other president. \"He has<br />\nneither has stopped the war.
