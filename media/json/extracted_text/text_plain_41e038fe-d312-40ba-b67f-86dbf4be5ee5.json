D.for doodley squat- you can't complain<br />\nBy LEO GORCEY<br />\nThe Garrett Room<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Library<br />\nOpen Wednesdays from 12 to 1 p.m.<br />\nLimited Menus<br />\nLive floor show<br />\nNo credit cards accepted<br />\nReservations not necessary<br />\nIt was with great trepidation that I<br />\nwent to the Garrett Room last<br />\nWednesday to hear that legendary arbiter<br />\nof haute cuisine, that gourmand of the<br />\ngutter press, John Dorsey\u2014I shudder to<br />\npronounce the awful name. As all<br />\nreaders of the Sun magazine well know,<br />\nJohn Dorsey is to Baltimore restaurants<br />\nwhat the boll weevil is to cotton plants.<br />\nWhen either one decides to feed his face,<br />\nyou're gonna know about it, Jack.<br />\nMeeting great personalities is usually a<br />\ndisappointment. They never live up to<br />\nyour expectations and pre-conceptions. I<br />\nhad figured the Great Culinary<br />\nIconoclast J.D. for a fire-breathing,<br />\ngargantuan entity, perhaps a member of<br />\nStan Lee's clan. I can't describe Dorsey's<br />\nappearance for you; all spectators were<br />\ncautioned not to photograph him or<br />\ndescribe him in print so as not to blow<br />\nhis cover for the restaurant owners. The<br />\nonly way to get away with being John<br />\nDorsey is for no one to know what you<br />\nlook like. Say, for example, you're<br />\nPolack Johnny down on Baltimore<br />\nStreet. The Sunpaper's ace critic has just<br />\nwalked into your Stygian hole of a food<br />\nemporium and you recognize him.<br />\nYou're not going to treat him like an<br />\nordinary customer. You're gonna lay<br />\nextra onions and garlic on his Coney<br />\nIsland\u2014on the house! He'll give you a<br />\ngood review, your business will take off,<br />\nand you'll be drinking Dom Perignon<br />\ninstead of National Boh. That just ain't<br />\nfair, to use the word Dorsey told us<br />\n<br />\ndoesn't belong in a critic's vocabulary. In<br />\norder for him to do his job right, Dorsey<br />\nhas to be anonymous. Which is just as<br />\nwell, for Dorsey has, as one judges from<br />\nhis talk here, a passion for anonymity.<br />\nI'd really love to describe him in print:<br />\nA) because he might get mad, stamp his<br />\nfoot, and splinter like Rumpelstiltskin,<br />\nwhich would be qpite amusing B)<br />\nbecause I was enjoined'not to, and I love<br />\nto break rules (vide my Hunter<br />\nThompson fiasco) C) because, dammit,<br />\n<br />\nsome of my best friends are restaurant<br />\nowners and they deserve to know what<br />\nJohn Dorsey looks like so they can<br />\nrefuse to serve him when he walks into<br />\ntheir places\u2014it might lead to an<br />\ninteresting court case.<br />\nSuffice it to say that Dorsey falls<br />\nsomewhere in between Caspar<br />\nMilquetoast and Genghis Khan, by way<br />\nof Gilman School and Hahvid College.<br />\nI really should try to summarize Mr.<br />\nDorsey's lecture on the job of a<br />\nreviewer\u2014it was really heavy!\u2014but I<br />\ncan't remember all his learned references<br />\nto Edmund Wilson and Matthew Arnold.<br />\nI mean most of the capacity crowd there<br />\nin the Garrett Room was interested in<br />\nFOOD, can you dig it? I, for one,<br />\nwanted to know where the hell you can<br />\nget a decent crab cake or a good-sized<br />\ndry Manhattan without being taken to<br />\nthe cleaners\u2014and instead, Dorsey holds<br />\nforth on Criticism in Theory and<br />\nPractice from Plato to Gertrude Stein in<br />\nForty Minutes. There's no way I can<br />\nsummarize an erudite disquisition\u2014such<br />\nas Mr. Dorsey\u2014gave in this rag. It just<br />\n<br />\nwouldn't be apropos. Besides, I didn't<br />\ntake notes since I was too busy drinking<br />\nthe University's free coffee, eating my<br />\nbrown\u2014bag special, and smoking a<br />\nBrazilian cigar left over from the Lincoln<br />\nGordon military coup back in '64.<br />\nAnyway, Dorsey eventually gave the<br />\nfolks what they wanted in the q-and-a<br />\nsession after his lecture. He related an<br />\namusing anecdote about a Glen Burnie<br />\nhashhouse with a big sign out front<br />\nsaying: \"John Dorsey ate here; But don't<br />\nlet it stop you.\" Someone in the<br />\naudience reminded the \"restaurant<br />\nreviewer malgre lui\" of another local<br />\nbeanery which boastfully advertises in<br />\nthe Sun: 'We're not recommended by<br />\nJohn Dorsey, Deo Gratias.\" Ah, the<br />\nslings and arrows...all in the job of a<br />\nreviewer.<br />\nBut, seriously folks, Baltimore owes<br />\nJohn Dorsey a huge debt of gratitude.<br />\nSince he started his weekly column in<br />\n1971, Baltimoreans have become<br />\nincreasingly conscious of the quality of<br />\nfood. Despite his pessimistic belief that<br />\nthe masses know nothing about taste,<br />\n<br />\none can only conclude that they are<br />\nstarting to learn. Go anywhere in<br />\nBaltimore and you will hear people<br />\ndiscussing Dorsey's latest review. The<br />\nman is both Sage and Celebrity, whether<br />\nhe likes it or not. The pen, after all, is<br />\nmightier than the skillet.<br />\nAnd now for the review. The Garrett<br />\nRoom suffers from its limited menu (le<br />\ncafe noir, seulement le cafe noir,<br />\nmonsieur), but it still possesses a<br />\ndelightful ambience. The decor is<br />\nconservative but elegant. Dr. Milton<br />\nEisenhower's portrait lends a certain<br />\npressence, a je ne sais quoi, to the room.<br />\nThe Persian rug, which has seen better<br />\ndays, yet exudes an exotic essence<br />\n(mayhap the half of baloney sandwich<br />\nthe geek sitting in from of me dropped<br />\nmidway through Matthew Arnold). The<br />\ncoffee, finally, lacked character. Still<br />\ncould not complain. As Kurt Vonnegut<br />\nmight put it, this was the tab for lunch<br />\nWednesday noon in the Garrett Room:<br />\ndoodley squat.<br />\nNext week: Harley's.<br />\n<br />\nGetting the gaipan: better than eating it<br />\nBy GEORGE ZELINSKY<br />\nAt one time or another, everyone's<br />\nknown that peculiar craving which<br />\ngrown from the pit of your stomach,<br />\nspreading in all directions til it explodes<br />\nin your brain, announcing (with all the<br />\nsubtlety of a pile driver), \"Chinese food!<br />\nI want Chinese food, dammit!\"<br />\nWell, while lounging away a<br />\nslow-moving Saturday afternoon with a<br />\nfriend of mine, the urge came to me,and<br />\nI realized that it was a perfect<br />\nopportunity to check out Mee Jun Low,<br />\na downtown dive which my friends told<br />\nme I was long overdue in<br />\nexperiencing\u2014\"Bohemian Chinese,\"<br />\nsomeone had described it.<br />\nSo we moved over to Mulberry Street<br />\n(\"Bohemian-Chinese?\" she muttered<br />\nunder her breath, \"I think we'd better<br />\nget high.\") where, after clambering to<br />\nthe top of an almost too-seeded flight of<br />\nstairs, we found the celebrated dive.<br />\nThe place was something to look at.<br />\nArchitecturally and esthetically it owed<br />\na lot to the head on a Scenicruiser. There<br />\nwere about ten tables, in a cramped<br />\nlow-ceiling room, which was done in a<br />\nkind of Far Eastern\u2014John Waters<br />\nModerne, featuring a number of<br />\nSears-Roebuck Chinese garden party<br />\nlanterns. The walls were adorned with<br />\nlarge scrawled ideograms. All that was<br />\nmissing was a Muzak machine playing<br />\nRay Connifis version of \"Kung Fu<br />\nFighting.\"<br />\nI looked at Rosie. \"This is great,\" she<br />\ngasped. At a loss for words, I leaned up<br />\nagainst the cash register, nddding<br />\nvigorously. \"There's one table left,\" I<br />\nobserved.<br />\n\"Aren't you supposed to wait for the<br />\n.waitress?\"<br />\n\"I dunno.\"<br />\nThe discussion became academic, as a<br />\nhuman typhoon came churning out of<br />\n<br />\nandthegaipanokay babe?!\"<br />\nthe kitchen, balancing three trays full of<br />\nChickenbeenporkorseafood?!\"<br />\nshoots, sprouts, and snowpeas with the<br />\n\"What the..!\"<br />\nskill of a Zambini, bellowing all the<br />\n\"Moogoogaipan'sgoodso'sthepork<br />\nwhile that the last table was ours so we'd<br />\nohyou likeseafoodlioney ?<br />\nbest go and get it.<br />\nThenit'llbesweetandsourshrimp<br />\nMoo...<br />\nFeeling kind of low for having stood<br />\n\"I didn't catch...\"<br />\n\"Won'ttakelongjustsittight!\"<br />\non ceremony, we shuffled over to the<br />\ntable to await developments.

The building, a gift from<br />\na neighboring church, is a decrepit<br />\nrowhouse that is in the process of being<br />\nrefurbished. It houses a printshop (the<br />\nPrint Co-op), \"a small Magazine little<br />\nPress emporium\" (the Book Stall), and<br />\nPoetry Project.<br />\nPoetry Project deserves particular<br />\nrecognition, since it is aimed at<br />\nstimulating public participation. Every<br />\nFriday night there are scheduled readings<br />\nby local poets. And as the posters say,<br />\nOpen readings follow. Open readings<br />\ndeserve some explanation. They are<br />\ncircular functions, complete with<br />\nProlonged reflective silences and a lot of<br />\nnodding. For some unexplained reason,<br />\nno comments are made, no discussions<br />\nensue. There is never any pressure to<br />\nread, but I always come equipped with a<br />\nream of my own poetry. You just don't<br />\nget a captive audience that often. The<br />\nOpen readings are the dessert after a<br />\nsumptuous two-hour dinner of formal<br />\nPoetry readings.<br />\nI have implied that Poetry Project<br />\nexists primarily for poets. It does. It also<br />\nexists for everyone. No one who is<br />\ninterested enough to come will feel<br />\n<br />\nuncomfortable. Each week, the posters<br />\nare plastered all over campus, even on<br />\nHugh Kenner's door, and 16 West<br />\nFranklin St. is only thirty cents away.<br />\nPoetry Project is just one facet of the<br />\nMWC programs. There are also writing<br />\nworkshops, downtown, in Towson and<br />\neven in Charles Village. So, if you desire<br />\nthe comments and discussion, an<br />\ninstructor who actually writes, and some<br />\nliterary stimulation outside of Hopkins'<br />\nlimitations, investigate it. The courses<br />\nare eight weeks long and cover<br />\njournalism, poetry, fiction and criticism.<br />\nThey began this week and cost a paltry<br />\nfifteen dollars. For information about<br />\nenrollment, call 332-1188 or drop in at<br />\n16 West Franklin.<br />\nWhile you're there you won't be able<br />\nto ignore the Book Stall. You'll find<br />\nmore funny little poetry magazines by<br />\npeople you've never heard of that you<br />\never thought possible. It's difficult to<br />\nbrowse because it's all so unfamiliar.<br />\nThere is good poetry there and I<br />\nchallenge you not to be intrigued.<br />\nThe News Print Co-op, now in its first<br />\nfull year of operation, exists solely to<br />\n<br />\nmake the writer's entrance into the<br />\npublished world easier. Small editions<br />\nare published almost \"at cost\" and are<br />\npromoted and distributed as actively as<br />\npossible. A nationwide chain of such<br />\nco-ops is presently being coordinated<br />\nand each will attempt to carry<br />\nrepresentative collections of the other's<br />\nstock. In other words, your poetry could<br />\nfind its way onto a shelf in Duluth. This<br />\nis being created as an alternative to the<br />\nanapproachable commercial publishing<br />\nhouses. The Maryland Writing Council is<br />\nempathatic about avoiding all of the<br />\ncommercial run-around. They are<br />\ndevoted to the writer, for they are<br />\nwriters themselves.<br />\nThe MWC also sponsors City Lit radio,<br />\nwhich is broadcast the first Sunday of<br />\neach month on WMJC-FM (91.5). Poetry<br />\nreadings and radio drama in your very<br />\nown living room,in all the glory that FM<br />\nstereo can provide.<br />\nThe News Print Co-op newsletter,<br />\nwhich is printed monthly, contains a<br />\ndetailed schedule of happenings at<br />\nTheater Project and in the<br />\nneighborhood. Also some odd and<br />\n<br />\noutspoken journalism. The Council also<br />\npublishes The Supplement to the<br />\nBulletin of the Maryland Writers<br />\nCouncil\u2014a bimonthly which deals<br />\nprimarily with publishing news and<br />\nviews. An interesting section called Hot<br />\nFlashes will keep you abreast of<br />\nupcoming local events.<br />\nNaturally all of this costs money, and<br />\nmoney is lacking. In order to negotiate a<br />\nsuccessful business venture, they are<br />\ngoing to need some support from the<br />\ncommunity. In this case, it isn't<br />\nexclusively monetary, but five dollars<br />\nwill entitle you to a yearly membership<br />\nwith a subscription to The Supolement,<br />\na discount on any workshops you might<br />\nchoose to take, and a complete lack of<br />\nguilt when you walk past the donation<br />\ncan. If you can donate time, that will do<br />\nas well\u2014and they'll pay you $2.75 an<br />\nhour.<br />\nIf you write at all, then you should<br />\nfeel the responsibility to drop in and talk<br />\nto some people there. If you like to<br />\nlisten, then come by on Friday night.<br />\nAnd if you want to get published,<br />\nremember\u2014it's a miserable business.<br />\n<br />\n\"Flesh Gordon\"- a study in escapism<br />\nBy MIKE DEAK<br />\nMuch as I hate to admit if, \"Flesh Gordon\"is indeed a good movie. Perhaps this<br />\nlapse in my critical judgement can be<br />\nexplained by a schematic recounting of<br />\nmy previous encounters with the flick.<br />\nOur first encounter, came during my<br />\nrancid prep school days when, one cold<br />\nConnecticut night, I was sitting in Otley<br />\nChesterfield's room leafing through<br />\nseveral \"Playboy's and came upon a six<br />\npage pictorial \"spread\" on \"Flesh<br />\nGordon.\" Like a pervert squeezing a<br />\nnymphet's tit, the article siezed my<br />\nimagination and a night of rambuctious<br />\ndreams ensued.<br />\nAbout Ph yews later, shortly before<br />\ngraduation, we managed to get a print of<br />\n\"Flesh Gordon\" for the annual senior<br />\nclass \"Blow-Out.\" I went with my<br />\nLiebste of the moment, Mary Lou<br />\nHooper, and I remember what I saw of<br />\nthe movie was just great. All, what fond<br />\nmemories it brings back!<br />\nJust last Friday I happened into a<br />\nBurger King in Essex for dinner and<br />\namazingly enough, the management was<br />\nshowing movies, one of which was the<br />\nfirst chapter from a \"Flash Gordon\"<br />\nserial. Needless to say, this brought back<br />\npleasurable, painful nostalgic memories.<br />\nAs soon as I got back to my bachelor<br />\napartment, I threw off my dinner jacket<br />\nand headed straight for the palatial Blue<br />\n<br />\nJay Cafe to get soaked.<br />\nOn assignment this Monday, I hiked<br />\ndown to the Charles Theatre to see<br />\n\"Flesh Gordon\" for the first time<br />\nseriously. As hard as I tried, I found it<br />\nimpossible to find fault with this perfect<br />\ncombination of two repulsive genres,<br />\nporno and science fiction movies. I don't<br />\nthink I've enjoyed a movie more since I<br />\nsaw \"The Horn Blows at Midnight\" last<br />\nChristmas.<br />\nA sex ray from outer space is driving<br />\nearth people mad with horniness. Orgies<br />\nerupt spontaneously on the streets. At a<br />\nconvention in Tibet, Flesh Gordon has<br />\ndiscovered the origin of the ray (the<br />\nplanet Porno) and tries to race home,<br />\nbut his plane is hit by the dastardly sex<br />\nray, and the pilots leave their controls to<br />\njoin the fun in first class. Somehow,<br />\nFlesh is not affected and manages to<br />\nparachute with a busty stewardess, Dale<br />\nArdour, seconds before the plane<br />\ncrashes. They land in the hide-out of the<br />\neccentric genius Dr. Jerkoff who<br />\ncoincidentally has just built, from parts<br />\nordered from Sears Roebuck, a phallic<br />\nspaceship. As Dale Ardour says, \"The<br />\nlikeness is remarkable.\"<br />\nSince Porno is at its closest point to<br />\nearth, Dr. Jerkoff's spaceship takes only<br />\nsix minutes to get there. But the ship is<br />\nslowed by the passage through the<br />\nmoronosphere and twisted wildly by the<br />\n<br />\nsex ray, and has to make a crash landing<br />\non Porno. There, our hero is met by<br />\nfierce penisoriuses and then taken<br />\ncaptive by Emperor Wang, the Perverted.<br />\nWang, sitting high above his copulating<br />\ncourt, keeps Dr. Jerkoff for his own<br />\nlaboratories, wants to marry Dale, and<br />\nthrows Flesh to barbaric women. It<br />\nwould be tasteless to reveal the rest of<br />\nthe plot except to say to keep an eye on<br />\nthe \"power pasties.\"<br />\nIn its own unique way, \"Flesh<br />\nGordon\" is much better than Kubrick's<br />\n\"2001.\" I actually believe the special<br />\neffects are more imaginative than<br />\nKubrick's. But most importantly, \"Flesh<br />\nGordon\" doesn't pretend, like the<br />\nshallow \"2001,\" to be profound. As the<br />\nproducers warn us at the beginning,<br />\n\"Flesh Gordon\" combines the spirit of<br />\nthe old with the outrageousness of the<br />\nnew. It fills a need for escapist<br />\nentertainment in these troubled times.\"<br />\n\"Flesh Gordon\" is playing this<br />\nweekend at Shriver Hall. I can't think of<br />\na better film to see in older to escape<br />\nf;om the boredom of reality.<br />\nAdmittedly, it is a sexist movie, but it<br />\ndoesn't seem to matter; to take \"Flesh<br />\nGordon\" seriously is a cardinal mistake.<br />\nNever Again<br />\nGo and enjoy \"Flesh Gordon.\" Take<br />\nyour Liebste, you will never see anything<br />\nlike it again.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4/news-letter/october 17, 1975<br />\n<br />\nHopkins alumni- penniless but still patriotic<br />\nalumni as active as most other colleges.<br />\nUnfortunately for Hopkins\u2014financially<br />\nspeaking\u2014Hopkins' alumni are not as<br />\nwealthy as the alumni of many other<br />\nschools.<br />\nThe lack of a large, rich, body of<br />\nalumni, however, has not hurt Hopkins<br />\nso much in obtaining donations\u2014the<br />\nUniversity is 11th in annual giving\u2014as<br />\nmuch as in the ability to attract<br />\nstudents.<br />\nAs President Muller told the Faculty<br />\nGeneral Assembly a few weeks ago,'We<br />\nlack a sufficient pool of wealthy families<br />\nwho will pay the full price to come here<br />\ncome hell or high water.\"<br />\nMuller is confident that it isn't that<br />\nHopkins alumni are any less loyal to<br />\ntheir alma mater than are alumni of<br />\nHarvard, Yale, and others, but that the<br />\nalumni are simply not extraordinarily<br />\nrich, like those of the Ivies.<br />\nIn addition, the University does suffer<br />\nfrom the fact that, unlike many other<br />\n<br />\nBy ALAN HIRSCH<br />\nIn the eyes of most college students,<br />\nAlumni have never been very exciting.<br />\nThe very word evokes images of fat<br />\nwealthy men driving through campus in<br />\nshiny limousines complaining \"it just<br />\nwasn't like this in my day.\" Alumni are<br />\nknown for wearing out-dated beanies<br />\nand waving pennants during meaningless<br />\nfootball games.<br />\nRegardless of what students may<br />\nthink, almost any college president will<br />\nadmit that the cultivation of alumni ties<br />\nand the support the alumni provide to<br />\nthe school are vital to the survival of an<br />\ninstitution of higher learning.<br />\nMoreover, at a time when private<br />\nschools are in greater need of donations<br />\nthan ever before and when the qualified<br />\nwealthy student can attend any school<br />\nhe wants, active alumni are even more<br />\ncrucial to their alma maters than ever<br />\nbefore.<br />\nHopkins is fortunate to have an<br />\n<br />\nby maintianing and strengthening ties<br />\nbetween the school and its alumni, gifts<br />\nwill naturally tend to be more<br />\ngenerous\u2014exists \"for the benefit of the<br />\nalumni,\" according to Alumni Relations<br />\nofficials.<br />\nThe Alumni Relations Office<br />\ncoordinates events for the Alumni<br />\nAssociation across the country.

The Sea Gulls are 3-2 overall after<br />\nhaving destroyed Jersey City State last<br />\nSaturday 65-6 on the Gulls home field.<br />\n<br />\nBackstroke to glory<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nWednesday marked an historic day in<br />\nthe annals of Hopkins' athletics as<br />\nfreshman swimmer Maria Mock departed<br />\nBaltimore for Mexico City to become<br />\nthe first member of the Homewood<br />\ncommunity ever to participate in the<br />\nprestigious Pan American Games.<br />\nOrganized similarly to the Olympic<br />\nGames, the Pan-Am games are limited to<br />\namateur athletes from the Americas and<br />\nAre held every four years in various<br />\nlocations on either continent.<br />\nMaria will be representing her native<br />\nPuerto Rico in the 200-yard backstroke<br />\nand possibly some relays.<br />\nShe started swimming competitively<br />\nat age 10 at a doctor's urging, hoping it<br />\nwould improve her asthma. Since then,<br />\nher improvement has been rapid. By age<br />\n13, Maria was the best butterflier in<br />\nPuerto Rico, a title she still holds.<br />\nThis will be her second appearance in<br />\nthe Pan-Ams. In 1971, she travelled to<br />\nCali, Colombia with the Puerto Rican<br />\nNational Team and gained valuable<br />\n-experience as well as a fifth place finish<br />\nin the 200 fly.<br />\nHer decision to join her<br />\nbrother\u2014 Carlos, a junior\u2014here at<br />\nHomewood was predicated as much on<br />\nher desire to experience all four seasons<br />\nof the year, as on the quality and<br />\n<br />\nintimate size of the University. \"I was<br />\ngoing to. attend either Hopkins or<br />\nFlorida State,\" the pert social and<br />\nbehavioral sciences major explained.<br />\n\"Both are fine swimming schools but the<br />\nsize and the location of Hopkins as well<br />\nas the fine facilities (for swimming) and<br />\nthe educational quality of the school led<br />\nme to select it.<br />\n\"Also the fact that I'd never seen<br />\nsnow,\"she added \"was important. Even<br />\nthe leaves turning colors is new to me.\"<br />\nFrank Comfort, head swimming coach<br />\nat Hopkins noted the differences<br />\nbetween the qualifying standards<br />\nneeded, pointing out that times are<br />\nfaster here than in Puerto Rico \"but<br />\nregardless of that, Maria will be a very,<br />\nvery good U.S. swimmer.\"<br />\nHer late departure will put Maria at a<br />\ndisadvantage being that she will arrive in<br />\nMexico City only five days before her<br />\nevent. Most other athletes have been<br />\ntraining in the high altitude for nearly a<br />\nmonth, acclimating themselves to the<br />\nunique conditions under which they will<br />\nbe competing.<br />\nMaria will join another member of<br />\nHomewood's \"extended\" aquatic<br />\ncommunity at the games. Wendy<br />\nWeinberg, a Baltimore high school senior<br />\nwho trains under Coach Comfort at<br />\nHopkins, will also be in Mexico City.<br />\n<br />\nThe hosts will provide the Jays with<br />\nsome mighty stiff competition.<br />\nFor Salisbury State this fall represents<br />\nonly their third year of varsity gridiron<br />\ncompetition. In the 'past two years, the<br />\nGulls have earned the reputation of<br />\nbeing a strong running team. In 1973<br />\nwhen they went 7-2 for the season,<br />\nSalisbury occupied the top slot in the<br />\nNAIA rushing charts.<br />\nLast year, in spite of a mediocre 4-4-1<br />\nrecord, the Gulls were 12th on the<br />\nNCAA Division III rushing charts.<br />\nDespite an attempt to broaden their<br />\naerial attack this fall, Salisbury State has<br />\nremained primarily a rushing team. That<br />\npowerful ground attack provides the<br />\nbasis for their offense.<br />\nThe Sea Gulls are led offensively by<br />\njunior backs Levi Shade and Jim Watson,<br />\nboth three-year starters. Last year<br />\nWatson ranked seventh in NCAA<br />\nDivision III rushing with an average of<br />\n125.7 yards per game.<br />\nIn the passing department, the hosts<br />\nare not quite as strong, though they do<br />\nhave a fine quarterback in Dave Cooper<br />\nand good, speedy receivers in flanker<br />\nTom Monthely and split end Jeff Polk.<br />\nPolk is an All-American trackman in the<br />\n100 and 200-yard dashes.<br />\nAnd, according to Head Coach Dick<br />\nYobst, this year's Gull offensive line is<br />\none of their best ever.<br />\nDefensively the Sea Gulls are strongest<br />\nin their secondary where they return<br />\nthree of four starters, and on the<br />\ndefensive line, with linebackers seeming<br />\nto be their weak link.<br />\nSalisbury State has a big team but<br />\nunlike Ursinus, they are mobile as well as<br />\nbig, as opposed to the ponderous Bears.<br />\n<br />\nDavid Porter<br />\n<br />\nHopkins will try to gull Salisbury<br />\n<br />\nSecond Quarter Action<br />\nTheir strong ground game will severely<br />\ntest the Hopkins rushing defense, a<br />\ngroup that has been inconsistent this<br />\nseason but on an upward trend. After<br />\nallowing over 400 yards in the opener<br />\nagainst Muhlenberg, the Jays held<br />\nUrsinus to a paltry 112 yards on the<br />\nground.<br />\nGreat improvement has been shown<br />\nby star defensive tackle Willie Oliver,<br />\nwho ahs done a yeoman job in the<br />\nmiddle of the Hopkins defensive corps.<br />\nOliver, a 6'2\", 210 pound junior from<br />\nBaltimore combines great strength which<br />\nallows him to stop the run, with<br />\nexcellent quickness and mobility which<br />\nmakes life hazardous for any opposing<br />\nsignla-caller attempting to pass.<br />\nJoining Oliver in the pits will be Scott<br />\nSmith. \"Stega\" is a converted tight end<br />\nwho has stepped in and done an<br />\nadmirable job filling the injury-vacated<br />\ndefensive tackle post.<br />\n<br />\n\fCAMPUS NOTES<br />\n<br />\nmeetings<br />\nHOPSFA<br />\nThe next irregular meeting of this campus<br />\norg interested in science fiction and fantasy,<br />\nwill be held on Wed., Oct. 22 at 7:30 pm in<br />\nConference Room A.

D.for doodley squat- you can't complain<br />\nBy LEO GORCEY<br />\nThe Garrett Room<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Library<br />\nOpen Wednesdays from 12 to 1 p.m.<br />\nLimited Menus<br />\nLive floor show<br />\nNo credit cards accepted<br />\nReservations not necessary<br />\nIt was with great trepidation that I<br />\nwent to the Garrett Room last<br />\nWednesday to hear that legendary arbiter<br />\nof haute cuisine, that gourmand of the<br />\ngutter press, John Dorsey\u2014I shudder to<br />\npronounce the awful name. As all<br />\nreaders of the Sun magazine well know,<br />\nJohn Dorsey is to Baltimore restaurants<br />\nwhat the boll weevil is to cotton plants.<br />\nWhen either one decides to feed his face,<br />\nyou're gonna know about it, Jack.<br />\nMeeting great personalities is usually a<br />\ndisappointment. They never live up to<br />\nyour expectations and pre-conceptions. I<br />\nhad figured the Great Culinary<br />\nIconoclast J.D. for a fire-breathing,<br />\ngargantuan entity, perhaps a member of<br />\nStan Lee's clan. I can't describe Dorsey's<br />\nappearance for you; all spectators were<br />\ncautioned not to photograph him or<br />\ndescribe him in print so as not to blow<br />\nhis cover for the restaurant owners. The<br />\nonly way to get away with being John<br />\nDorsey is for no one to know what you<br />\nlook like. Say, for example, you're<br />\nPolack Johnny down on Baltimore<br />\nStreet. The Sunpaper's ace critic has just<br />\nwalked into your Stygian hole of a food<br />\nemporium and you recognize him.<br />\nYou're not going to treat him like an<br />\nordinary customer. You're gonna lay<br />\nextra onions and garlic on his Coney<br />\nIsland\u2014on the house! He'll give you a<br />\ngood review, your business will take off,<br />\nand you'll be drinking Dom Perignon<br />\ninstead of National Boh. That just ain't<br />\nfair, to use the word Dorsey told us<br /><br />\ndoesn't belong in a critic's vocabulary. In<br />\norder for him to do his job right, Dorsey<br />\nhas to be anonymous. Which is just as<br />\nwell, for Dorsey has, as one judges from<br />\nhis talk here, a passion for anonymity.<br />\nI'd really love to describe him in print:<br />\nA) because he might get mad, stamp his<br />\nfoot, and splinter like Rumpelstiltskin,<br />\nwhich would be qpite amusing B)<br />\nbecause I was enjoined'not to, and I love<br />\nto break rules (vide my Hunter<br />\nThompson fiasco) C) because, dammit,<br /><br />\nsome of my best friends are restaurant<br />\nowners and they deserve to know what<br />\nJohn Dorsey looks like so they can<br />\nrefuse to serve him when he walks into<br />\ntheir places\u2014it might lead to an<br />\ninteresting court case.<br />\nSuffice it to say that Dorsey falls<br />\nsomewhere in between Caspar<br />\nMilquetoast and Genghis Khan, by way<br />\nof Gilman School and Hahvid College.<br />\nI really should try to summarize Mr.<br />\nDorsey's lecture on the job of a<br />\nreviewer\u2014it was really heavy!\u2014but I<br />\ncan't remember all his learned references<br />\nto Edmund Wilson and Matthew Arnold.<br />\nI mean most of the capacity crowd there<br />\nin the Garrett Room was interested in<br />\nFOOD, can you dig it? I, for one,<br />\nwanted to know where the hell you can<br />\nget a decent crab cake or a good-sized<br />\ndry Manhattan without being taken to<br />\nthe cleaners\u2014and instead, Dorsey holds<br />\nforth on Criticism in Theory and<br />\nPractice from Plato to Gertrude Stein in<br />\nForty Minutes. There's no way I can<br />\nsummarize an erudite disquisition\u2014such<br />\nas Mr. Dorsey\u2014gave in this rag. It just<br /><br />\nwouldn't be apropos. Besides, I didn't<br />\ntake notes since I was too busy drinking<br />\nthe University's free coffee, eating my<br />\nbrown\u2014bag special, and smoking a<br />\nBrazilian cigar left over from the Lincoln<br />\nGordon military coup back in '64.<br />\nAnyway, Dorsey eventually gave the<br />\nfolks what they wanted in the q-and-a<br />\nsession after his lecture. He related an<br />\namusing anecdote about a Glen Burnie<br />\nhashhouse with a big sign out front<br />\nsaying: \"John Dorsey ate here; But don't<br />\nlet it stop you.\" Someone in the<br />\naudience reminded the \"restaurant<br />\nreviewer malgre lui\" of another local<br />\nbeanery which boastfully advertises in<br />\nthe Sun: 'We're not recommended by<br />\nJohn Dorsey, Deo Gratias.\" Ah, the<br />\nslings and arrows...all in the job of a<br />\nreviewer.<br />\nBut, seriously folks, Baltimore owes<br />\nJohn Dorsey a huge debt of gratitude.<br />\nSince he started his weekly column in<br />\n1971, Baltimoreans have become<br />\nincreasingly conscious of the quality of<br />\nfood. Despite his pessimistic belief that<br />\nthe masses know nothing about taste,<br /><br />\none can only conclude that they are<br />\nstarting to learn. Go anywhere in<br />\nBaltimore and you will hear people<br />\ndiscussing Dorsey's latest review. The<br />\nman is both Sage and Celebrity, whether<br />\nhe likes it or not. The pen, after all, is<br />\nmightier than the skillet.<br />\nAnd now for the review. The Garrett<br />\nRoom suffers from its limited menu (le<br />\ncafe noir, seulement le cafe noir,<br />\nmonsieur), but it still possesses a<br />\ndelightful ambience. The decor is<br />\nconservative but elegant. Dr. Milton<br />\nEisenhower's portrait lends a certain<br />\npressence, a je ne sais quoi, to the room.<br />\nThe Persian rug, which has seen better<br />\ndays, yet exudes an exotic essence<br />\n(mayhap the half of baloney sandwich<br />\nthe geek sitting in from of me dropped<br />\nmidway through Matthew Arnold). The<br />\ncoffee, finally, lacked character. Still<br />\ncould not complain. As Kurt Vonnegut<br />\nmight put it, this was the tab for lunch<br />\nWednesday noon in the Garrett Room:<br />\ndoodley squat.<br />\nNext week: Harley's.<br /><br />\nGetting the gaipan: better than eating it<br />\nBy GEORGE ZELINSKY<br />\nAt one time or another, everyone's<br />\nknown that peculiar craving which<br />\ngrown from the pit of your stomach,<br />\nspreading in all directions til it explodes<br />\nin your brain, announcing (with all the<br />\nsubtlety of a pile driver), \"Chinese food!<br />\nI want Chinese food, dammit!\"<br />\nWell, while lounging away a<br />\nslow-moving Saturday afternoon with a<br />\nfriend of mine, the urge came to me,and<br />\nI realized that it was a perfect<br />\nopportunity to check out Mee Jun Low,<br />\na downtown dive which my friends told<br />\nme I was long overdue in<br />\nexperiencing\u2014\"Bohemian Chinese,\"<br />\nsomeone had described it.<br />\nSo we moved over to Mulberry Street<br />\n(\"Bohemian-Chinese?\" she muttered<br />\nunder her breath, \"I think we'd better<br />\nget high.\") where, after clambering to<br />\nthe top of an almost too-seeded flight of<br />\nstairs, we found the celebrated dive.<br />\nThe place was something to look at.<br />\nArchitecturally and esthetically it owed<br />\na lot to the head on a Scenicruiser. There<br />\nwere about ten tables, in a cramped<br />\nlow-ceiling room, which was done in a<br />\nkind of Far Eastern\u2014John Waters<br />\nModerne, featuring a number of<br />\nSears-Roebuck Chinese garden party<br />\nlanterns. The walls were adorned with<br />\nlarge scrawled ideograms. All that was<br />\nmissing was a Muzak machine playing<br />\nRay Connifis version of \"Kung Fu<br />\nFighting.\"<br />\nI looked at Rosie. \"This is great,\" she<br />\ngasped. At a loss for words, I leaned up<br />\nagainst the cash register, nddding<br />\nvigorously. \"There's one table left,\" I<br />\nobserved.<br />\n\"Aren't you supposed to wait for the<br />\n.waitress?\"<br />\n\"I dunno.\"<br />\nThe discussion became academic, as a<br />\nhuman typhoon came churning out of<br /><br />\nandthegaipanokay babe?!\"<br />\nthe kitchen, balancing three trays full of<br />\nChickenbeenporkorseafood?!\"<br />\nshoots, sprouts, and snowpeas with the<br />\n\"What the..!\"<br />\nskill of a Zambini, bellowing all the<br />\n\"Moogoogaipan'sgoodso'sthepork<br />\nwhile that the last table was ours so we'd<br />\nohyou likeseafoodlioney ?<br />\nbest go and get it.<br />\nThenit'llbesweetandsourshrimp<br />\nMoo...<br />\nFeeling kind of low for having stood<br />\n\"I didn't catch...\"<br />\n\"Won'ttakelongjustsittight!\"<br />\non ceremony, we shuffled over to the<br />\ntable to await developments.

Small<br />\nmagazines of poetry and prose are the<br />\nunknown writer's only dependable<br />\noutlet.<br />\nLiterary magazines funded by<br />\nuniversities are relatively few in number,<br />\nand are usually distributed without<br />\ncharge to a limited group. External, \"real<br />\nWorld,\" publications are more widely<br />\ndistributed, always cost money, and<br />\nOften have the same flaws as the<br />\nI nstitutional publications. There are,<br />\nhowever, more of them. And you don't<br />\nhave to attend any college to have a<br />\nChance of gaining acceptance. For most,<br />\nthese small independent magazines<br />\nafford the young writer a chance to<br />\nenter the elite world of the published.<br />\nThe Maryland Writers Council is one<br />\ndominant local factor in this struggle.<br />\n.1 first became aware of the council's<br />\nexistence while attending Poetry Project<br />\nlast year. At the time, Poetry Project was<br />\nmeeting Friday nights in the basement of<br />\nTheater Project, which as the publicity<br />\non campus has told you, is located on<br />\nWest Preston Street, near the heart of<br />\ndowntown Baltimore. Poetry project is<br />\nS ponsored by the Maryland Writers<br />\nCouncil(MWC).<br />\nThis past year was apparently a very<br />\nformative one for the Council, because<br />\nthey now have their own building at 16<br />\nWest Franklin Street, just a few doors<br />\ndown from Tio Pepes, in the heart of<br />\nBaltimore City. The building, a gift from<br />\na neighboring church, is a decrepit<br />\nrowhouse that is in the process of being<br />\nrefurbished. It houses a printshop (the<br />\nPrint Co-op), \"a small Magazine little<br />\nPress emporium\" (the Book Stall), and<br />\nPoetry Project.<br />\nPoetry Project deserves particular<br />\nrecognition, since it is aimed at<br />\nstimulating public participation. Every<br />\nFriday night there are scheduled readings<br />\nby local poets. And as the posters say,<br />\nOpen readings follow. Open readings<br />\ndeserve some explanation. They are<br />\ncircular functions, complete with<br />\nProlonged reflective silences and a lot of<br />\nnodding. For some unexplained reason,<br />\nno comments are made, no discussions<br />\nensue. There is never any pressure to<br />\nread, but I always come equipped with a<br />\nream of my own poetry. You just don't<br />\nget a captive audience that often. The<br />\nOpen readings are the dessert after a<br />\nsumptuous two-hour dinner of formal<br />\nPoetry readings.<br />\nI have implied that Poetry Project<br />\nexists primarily for poets. It does. It also<br />\nexists for everyone. No one who is<br />\ninterested enough to come will feel<br /><br />\nuncomfortable. Each week, the posters<br />\nare plastered all over campus, even on<br />\nHugh Kenner's door, and 16 West<br />\nFranklin St. is only thirty cents away.<br />\nPoetry Project is just one facet of the<br />\nMWC programs. There are also writing<br />\nworkshops, downtown, in Towson and<br />\neven in Charles Village. So, if you desire<br />\nthe comments and discussion, an<br />\ninstructor who actually writes, and some<br />\nliterary stimulation outside of Hopkins'<br />\nlimitations, investigate it. The courses<br />\nare eight weeks long and cover<br />\njournalism, poetry, fiction and criticism.<br />\nThey began this week and cost a paltry<br />\nfifteen dollars.

You'll find<br />\nmore funny little poetry magazines by<br />\npeople you've never heard of that you<br />\never thought possible. It's difficult to<br />\nbrowse because it's all so unfamiliar.<br />\nThere is good poetry there and I<br />\nchallenge you not to be intrigued.<br />\nThe News Print Co-op, now in its first<br />\nfull year of operation, exists solely to<br /><br />\nmake the writer's entrance into the<br />\npublished world easier. Small editions<br />\nare published almost \"at cost\" and are<br />\npromoted and distributed as actively as<br />\npossible. A nationwide chain of such<br />\nco-ops is presently being coordinated<br />\nand each will attempt to carry<br />\nrepresentative collections of the other's<br />\nstock. In other words, your poetry could<br />\nfind its way onto a shelf in Duluth. This<br />\nis being created as an alternative to the<br />\nanapproachable commercial publishing<br />\nhouses.

Perhaps this<br />\nlapse in my critical judgement can be<br />\nexplained by a schematic recounting of<br />\nmy previous encounters with the flick.<br />\nOur first encounter, came during my<br />\nrancid prep school days when, one cold<br />\nConnecticut night, I was sitting in Otley<br />\nChesterfield's room leafing through<br />\nseveral \"Playboy's and came upon a six<br />\npage pictorial \"spread\" on \"Flesh<br />\nGordon.\" Like a pervert squeezing a<br />\nnymphet's tit, the article siezed my<br />\nimagination and a night of rambuctious<br />\ndreams ensued.<br />\nAbout Ph yews later, shortly before<br />\ngraduation, we managed to get a print of<br />\n\"Flesh Gordon\" for the annual senior<br />\nclass \"Blow-Out.\" I went with my<br />\nLiebste of the moment, Mary Lou<br />\nHooper, and I remember what I saw of<br />\nthe movie was just great. All, what fond<br />\nmemories it brings back!<br />\nJust last Friday I happened into a<br />\nBurger King in Essex for dinner and<br />\namazingly enough, the management was<br />\nshowing movies, one of which was the<br />\nfirst chapter from a \"Flash Gordon\"<br />\nserial. Needless to say, this brought back<br />\npleasurable, painful nostalgic memories.<br />\nAs soon as I got back to my bachelor<br />\napartment, I threw off my dinner jacket<br />\nand headed straight for the palatial Blue<br /><br />\nJay Cafe to get soaked.<br />\nOn assignment this Monday, I hiked<br />\ndown to the Charles Theatre to see<br />\n\"Flesh Gordon\" for the first time<br />\nseriously. As hard as I tried, I found it<br />\nimpossible to find fault with this perfect<br />\ncombination of two repulsive genres,<br />\nporno and science fiction movies. I don't<br />\nthink I've enjoyed a movie more since I<br />\nsaw \"The Horn Blows at Midnight\" last<br />\nChristmas.<br />\nA sex ray from outer space is driving<br />\nearth people mad with horniness. Orgies<br />\nerupt spontaneously on the streets. At a<br />\nconvention in Tibet, Flesh Gordon has<br />\ndiscovered the origin of the ray (the<br />\nplanet Porno) and tries to race home,<br />\nbut his plane is hit by the dastardly sex<br />\nray, and the pilots leave their controls to<br />\njoin the fun in first class. Somehow,<br />\nFlesh is not affected and manages to<br />\nparachute with a busty stewardess, Dale<br />\nArdour, seconds before the plane<br />\ncrashes. They land in the hide-out of the<br />\neccentric genius Dr. Jerkoff who<br />\ncoincidentally has just built, from parts<br />\nordered from Sears Roebuck, a phallic<br />\nspaceship. As Dale Ardour says, \"The<br />\nlikeness is remarkable.\"<br />\nSince Porno is at its closest point to<br />\nearth, Dr. Jerkoff's spaceship takes only<br />\nsix minutes to get there. But the ship is<br />\nslowed by the passage through the<br />\nmoronosphere and twisted wildly by the<br /><br />\nsex ray, and has to make a crash landing<br />\non Porno. There, our hero is met by<br />\nfierce penisoriuses and then taken<br />\ncaptive by Emperor Wang, the Perverted.<br />\nWang, sitting high above his copulating<br />\ncourt, keeps Dr. Jerkoff for his own<br />\nlaboratories, wants to marry Dale, and<br />\nthrows Flesh to barbaric women. It<br />\nwould be tasteless to reveal the rest of<br />\nthe plot except to say to keep an eye on<br />\nthe \"power pasties.\"<br />\nIn its own unique way, \"Flesh<br />\nGordon\" is much better than Kubrick's<br />\n\"2001.\" I actually believe the special<br />\neffects are more imaginative than<br />\nKubrick's. But most importantly, \"Flesh<br />\nGordon\" doesn't pretend, like the<br />\nshallow \"2001,\" to be profound. As the<br />\nproducers warn us at the beginning,<br />\n\"Flesh Gordon\" combines the spirit of<br />\nthe old with the outrageousness of the<br />\nnew. It fills a need for escapist<br />\nentertainment in these troubled times.\"<br />\n\"Flesh Gordon\" is playing this<br />\nweekend at Shriver Hall. I can't think of<br />\na better film to see in older to escape<br />\nf;om the boredom of reality.<br />\nAdmittedly, it is a sexist movie, but it<br />\ndoesn't seem to matter; to take \"Flesh<br />\nGordon\" seriously is a cardinal mistake.<br />\nNever Again<br />\nGo and enjoy \"Flesh Gordon.\" Take<br />\nyour Liebste, you will never see anything<br />\nlike it again.<br /><br />\npage 4/news-letter/october 17, 1975<br /><br />\nHopkins alumni- penniless but still patriotic<br />\nalumni as active as most other colleges.<br />\nUnfortunately for Hopkins\u2014financially<br />\nspeaking\u2014Hopkins' alumni are not as<br />\nwealthy as the alumni of many other<br />\nschools.<br />\nThe lack of a large, rich, body of<br />\nalumni, however, has not hurt Hopkins<br />\nso much in obtaining donations\u2014the<br />\nUniversity is 11th in annual giving\u2014as<br />\nmuch as in the ability to attract<br />\nstudents.<br />\nAs President Muller told the Faculty<br />\nGeneral Assembly a few weeks ago,'We<br />\nlack a sufficient pool of wealthy families<br />\nwho will pay the full price to come here<br />\ncome hell or high water.\"<br />\nMuller is confident that it isn't that<br />\nHopkins alumni are any less loyal to<br />\ntheir alma mater than are alumni of<br />\nHarvard, Yale, and others, but that the<br />\nalumni are simply not extraordinarily<br />\nrich, like those of the Ivies.<br />\nIn addition, the University does suffer<br />\nfrom the fact that, unlike many other<br /><br />\nBy ALAN HIRSCH<br />\nIn the eyes of most college students,<br />\nAlumni have never been very exciting.<br />\nThe very word evokes images of fat<br />\nwealthy men driving through campus in<br />\nshiny limousines complaining \"it just<br />\nwasn't like this in my day.\" Alumni are<br />\nknown for wearing out-dated beanies<br />\nand waving pennants during meaningless<br />\nfootball games.<br />\nRegardless of what students may<br />\nthink, almost any college president will<br />\nadmit that the cultivation of alumni ties<br />\nand the support the alumni provide to<br />\nthe school are vital to the survival of an<br />\ninstitution of higher learning.<br />\nMoreover, at a time when private<br />\nschools are in greater need of donations<br />\nthan ever before and when the qualified<br />\nwealthy student can attend any school<br />\nhe wants, active alumni are even more<br />\ncrucial to their alma maters than ever<br />\nbefore.<br />\nHopkins is fortunate to have an<br /><br />\nby maintianing and strengthening ties<br />\nbetween the school and its alumni, gifts<br />\nwill naturally tend to be more<br />\ngenerous\u2014exists \"for the benefit of the<br />\nalumni,\" according to Alumni Relations<br />\nofficials.<br />\nThe Alumni Relations Office<br />\ncoordinates events for the Alumni<br />\nAssociation across the country.

The Sea Gulls are 3-2 overall after<br />\nhaving destroyed Jersey City State last<br />\nSaturday 65-6 on the Gulls home field.<br /><br />\nBackstroke to glory<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nWednesday marked an historic day in<br />\nthe annals of Hopkins' athletics as<br />\nfreshman swimmer Maria Mock departed<br />\nBaltimore for Mexico City to become<br />\nthe first member of the Homewood<br />\ncommunity ever to participate in the<br />\nprestigious Pan American Games.<br />\nOrganized similarly to the Olympic<br />\nGames, the Pan-Am games are limited to<br />\namateur athletes from the Americas and<br />\nAre held every four years in various<br />\nlocations on either continent.<br />\nMaria will be representing her native<br />\nPuerto Rico in the 200-yard backstroke<br />\nand possibly some relays.<br />\nShe started swimming competitively<br />\nat age 10 at a doctor's urging, hoping it<br />\nwould improve her asthma. Since then,<br />\nher improvement has been rapid. By age<br />\n13, Maria was the best butterflier in<br />\nPuerto Rico, a title she still holds.<br />\nThis will be her second appearance in<br />\nthe Pan-Ams. In 1971, she travelled to<br />\nCali, Colombia with the Puerto Rican<br />\nNational Team and gained valuable<br />\n-experience as well as a fifth place finish<br />\nin the 200 fly.<br />\nHer decision to join her<br />\nbrother\u2014 Carlos, a junior\u2014here at<br />\nHomewood was predicated as much on<br />\nher desire to experience all four seasons<br />\nof the year, as on the quality and<br /><br />\nintimate size of the University. \"I was<br />\ngoing to. attend either Hopkins or<br />\nFlorida State,\" the pert social and<br />\nbehavioral sciences major explained.<br />\n\"Both are fine swimming schools but the<br />\nsize and the location of Hopkins as well<br />\nas the fine facilities (for swimming) and<br />\nthe educational quality of the school led<br />\nme to select it.<br />\n\"Also the fact that I'd never seen<br />\nsnow,\"she added \"was important. Even<br />\nthe leaves turning colors is new to me.\"<br />\nFrank Comfort, head swimming coach<br />\nat Hopkins noted the differences<br />\nbetween the qualifying standards<br />\nneeded, pointing out that times are<br />\nfaster here than in Puerto Rico \"but<br />\nregardless of that, Maria will be a very,<br />\nvery good U.S. swimmer.\"<br />\nHer late departure will put Maria at a<br />\ndisadvantage being that she will arrive in<br />\nMexico City only five days before her<br />\nevent. Most other athletes have been<br />\ntraining in the high altitude for nearly a<br />\nmonth, acclimating themselves to the<br />\nunique conditions under which they will<br />\nbe competing.<br />\nMaria will join another member of<br />\nHomewood's \"extended\" aquatic<br />\ncommunity at the games. Wendy<br />\nWeinberg, a Baltimore high school senior<br />\nwho trains under Coach Comfort at<br />\nHopkins, will also be in Mexico City.<br /><br />\nThe hosts will provide the Jays with<br />\nsome mighty stiff competition.<br />\nFor Salisbury State this fall represents<br />\nonly their third year of varsity gridiron<br />\ncompetition. In the 'past two years, the<br />\nGulls have earned the reputation of<br />\nbeing a strong running team. In 1973<br />\nwhen they went 7-2 for the season,<br />\nSalisbury occupied the top slot in the<br />\nNAIA rushing charts.<br />\nLast year, in spite of a mediocre 4-4-1<br />\nrecord, the Gulls were 12th on the<br />\nNCAA Division III rushing charts.<br />\nDespite an attempt to broaden their<br />\naerial attack this fall, Salisbury State has<br />\nremained primarily a rushing team. That<br />\npowerful ground attack provides the<br />\nbasis for their offense.<br />\nThe Sea Gulls are led offensively by<br />\njunior backs Levi Shade and Jim Watson,<br />\nboth three-year starters. Last year<br />\nWatson ranked seventh in NCAA<br />\nDivision III rushing with an average of<br />\n125.7 yards per game.<br />\nIn the passing department, the hosts<br />\nare not quite as strong, though they do<br />\nhave a fine quarterback in Dave Cooper<br />\nand good, speedy receivers in flanker<br />\nTom Monthely and split end Jeff Polk.<br />\nPolk is an All-American trackman in the<br />\n100 and 200-yard dashes.<br />\nAnd, according to Head Coach Dick<br />\nYobst, this year's Gull offensive line is<br />\none of their best ever.<br />\nDefensively the Sea Gulls are strongest<br />\nin their secondary where they return<br />\nthree of four starters, and on the<br />\ndefensive line, with linebackers seeming<br />\nto be their weak link.<br />\nSalisbury State has a big team but<br />\nunlike Ursinus, they are mobile as well as<br />\nbig, as opposed to the ponderous Bears.<br /><br />\nDavid Porter<br /><br />\nHopkins will try to gull Salisbury<br /><br />\nSecond Quarter Action<br />\nTheir strong ground game will severely<br />\ntest the Hopkins rushing defense, a<br />\ngroup that has been inconsistent this<br />\nseason but on an upward trend. After<br />\nallowing over 400 yards in the opener<br />\nagainst Muhlenberg, the Jays held<br />\nUrsinus to a paltry 112 yards on the<br />\nground.<br />\nGreat improvement has been shown<br />\nby star defensive tackle Willie Oliver,<br />\nwho ahs done a yeoman job in the<br />\nmiddle of the Hopkins defensive corps.<br />\nOliver, a 6'2\", 210 pound junior from<br />\nBaltimore combines great strength which<br />\nallows him to stop the run, with<br />\nexcellent quickness and mobility which<br />\nmakes life hazardous for any opposing<br />\nsignla-caller attempting to pass.<br />\nJoining Oliver in the pits will be Scott<br />\nSmith. \"Stega\" is a converted tight end<br />\nwho has stepped in and done an<br />\nadmirable job filling the injury-vacated<br />\ndefensive tackle post.<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br /><br />\nmeetings<br />\nHOPSFA<br />\nThe next irregular meeting of this campus<br />\norg interested in science fiction and fantasy,<br />\nwill be held on Wed., Oct. 22 at 7:30 pm in<br />\nConference Room A.
