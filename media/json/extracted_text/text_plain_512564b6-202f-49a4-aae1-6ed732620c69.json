He<br />\npointed out that there has been a<br />\nsignificant change in the court, not<br />\nonly in personnel, but in jurisprudence. As examples of this change<br />\nin jurisprudence, Mr Sachs pointed<br />\nout that the minimum wage for women and children was formerly held<br />\nunconstitutional. The Court later reversed itself and implied that it had<br />\nmisconstrued the Constitution. The<br />\nCourt also formerly held that labor<br />\nconditions and industrial relations<br />\nwere matters for the states to control. Now the Federal government<br />\ncan and does exercise authority over<br />\nthese matters.<br />\nAccording to Mr Sachs this<br />\nchange in jurisprudence is not due to<br />\nthe change in the personnel of the<br />\nCourt as the ordinary laymen thinks,<br />\nbut has come about as a result of<br />\nthe scare which the President's Supreme Court bill threw into the members of the Court. Mr Sachs gave<br />\nfigures to show that, whereas the<br />\ndissenting opinions were formerly<br />\nthose of the liberals, Brandeis,<br />\nStone, and Cardoza; they were the<br />\nopinions of the conservative bloc,<br />\nButler, MacReynolds, Sutherland, and<br />\nVanDevanter after the Court plan<br />\nwas proposed.

Emotional and rational considerations alike lead to stalemates or resolve<br />\nthemselves into vicious circles. Whether one argues<br />\nfinances, enrollment or the intangibles of liberalism,<br />\nproponent or opponent is right or wrong only according to original assumptions.<br />\nValidity in the debate of intangibles seems to lie<br />\nonly in the question of whether or not opposition to<br />\nadmission exists in the graduate b school. Obviously,<br />\nbecause of the not-to-be-ignored fact of close association of students in one school of a university, this-question had to be answered. And it was answered in a<br />\nrecently held poll by a large majority vote in favor<br />\nof admission.<br />\nIf the whole question were considered simply as<br />\nthe case of one Edward Lewis, qualified for admission, there would be no bogging down in a morass of<br />\nabstraction and debate. And the best way to solve<br />\nthe problem, it seems to us, is to return to simplicity,<br />\nexamine the record of Edward Lewis without regard<br />\nto his color, and forget shifty ponderables which lead<br />\nnowhere. Such a policy could result only in admission, since Mr Lewis is particularly well qualified.<br />\nIt w*uld seem that we<br />\nhaven't made ourselves<br />\nH, S, F:<br />\nquite clear on this question<br />\nof marks. We fully apprea Few<br />\nciate the need for some<br />\nwords more<br />\nmodification in our present<br />\nsystem of conveying a true<br />\nimpression of a student's record here to interested<br />\n,outsiders. It is merely the form of_the modification<br />\nadopted to which we take exception.<br />\nWe make the primary assumption that one comes<br />\nto college to get an education. There is something<br />\ndefinitely wrong with a system in which marks or<br />\nrewards, rather than knowledge, are the criteria or the<br />\nincentive to study. This despite the fact that many<br />\nare forced into holding with the former concept<br />\nthrough years of sad experience.<br />\nThe psychological effect of a material reward sys-<br />\n<br />\ntern is an extremely bad one, forcing an individual<br />\nconsciously or unconsciously to adopt a competitive<br />\nrather than a self-benefiting attitude. As much as<br />\npossible, the evaluation of learning on a basis of comparison must be eliminated. Taking the long view,<br />\none's marks are of no value per se. As indicators of<br />\nability they are at best questionable. Let them not,<br />\nithen, be set up in the false light of being and ending<br />\nall. If they must be, let them be as innocuous as<br />\npossible.<br />\nThe ideal system is one of no marks, or a simple<br />\npass or fail. The Hopkins had an approach to this.<br />\nUnfortunately, those men forced into a competitive<br />\nfield upon leaving the Hopkins came to much grief.<br />\nHowever, as we have stated, it is possible to deal with<br />\nthis and yet retain the effect of the H S F system. A<br />\ndetailed evaluation of each S, made a part of a transcript, achieves the purpose of affording outside schools<br />\nbasis for comparison, yet need cause the student no<br />\nconcern.<br />\nSuch a system is not so involved as might first<br />\nappear. In effect, it is already efficiently operating in<br />\nseveral departments of the University, notably chemistry. It should be accorded due consultation and<br />\nthought.<br />\nThe Board of collegiate studies has made a most<br />\nserious mistake in underevaluating the ultimate psychological effect of their proposed change. Thus in<br />\none move is shattered a principle resulting from long<br />\nyears of evolution. A further consideration might<br />\nwell be in order.<br />\nIf anything democracies<br />\ncan stomach has been<br />\ngleaned from the sorry<br />\nhash our shining republic<br />\nhas made of Spanish-American relations since 1936 it<br />\nhad better be gulped down<br />\nhurriedly and with gusto.<br />\nFor in Mexico notices of \"The Spanish Tragedy,\"<br />\nwith a new cast, have already been posted. President<br />\nCardenas is faced with an opposition which differs<br />\nfrom El Caudillo Franco's Spanish Phalanx only in<br />\nname and accessibility to foreign support. He also<br />\nfaces elections next year and if we don't miss our guess,<br />\nwe will see a recurrence of the disconcerting Mexican<br />\nhabit of using assorted lethal weapons as near the ballot box as practicable.<br />\nAs the United States turns to face south, however,<br />\nit will probably remember only one thing. Off and<br />\non for the past thirty years, Mexico has been engagedin a social revolution by which a few thousand Americans lost that sixteen million Mexicans might gain.<br />\nThe obvious advantages of having a non-fascist government in Mexico will be thrust aside while these few<br />\nthousands scream their lungs out about $69,000,00,0<br />\nin oil holdings, expropriated by the Cardenas government. Which they built up, incidentally, after Mexico's constitutional provision prohibiting foreign holdings was fearfully discarded by President Carranza in<br />\n1917, because of American imperialist threats.<br />\nAnd in all probability, there will be a carefully<br />\ncalculated waving of the red herring, as in the Spanish<br />\ncrisis. Already, in a Senate debate, Senator Reynolds<br />\nof North Carolina has proclaimed, \"Let us see about<br />\nMexico. It is Communistic, 100 per cent. There are<br />\nassassinations everywhere in that country. They confiscated. . . . farm land belonging to American citizens. . . . They stole millions upon millions of dollars<br />\nworth of oil, the wells producing, which had been dug<br />\nby American dollars.\"<br />\nAdd to the already bitter feeling of the oil companies Senator Reynolds' opinions and the fact that<br />\nour own New Deal will be busy attempting to rake in<br />\nthe votes at about the time Mexico promises to cut<br />\nloose, and you have a sum which will not please liberals. Also, we have a sneaking suspicion that Americans whose investments have suffered at Cardenas'<br />\nhands will not be content to merely have a hands-off<br />\nUnited States, but will advocate a pro-fascist stand,<br />\ndubbed a \"Keep Communism out of the Western<br />\nHemisphere\" movement.<br />\n<br />\nMexican<br />\npreview<br />\n<br />\nWe hold no brief for the<br />\nYCL, nor do we find OUTselves in any particular<br />\nsympathy with the hogwash<br />\nincluded with the other<br />\nmaterials in the bulletin<br />\nwhich it chose to release to<br />\nthe campus last week. So much of the matter was of<br />\ndoubtful veracity or impossible of proof that the writing defeated its own purpose by effectually camouflauging such truths as it attempted to set forth. The charge<br />\nthat economic stringency was employed as false excuse<br />\nfor dismissing a liberal faculty member, for instance,<br />\nwe believe to be an utterly unfounded claim.<br />\nBut the basic accu4ation made by the group, secret<br />\nor not, is not to be lightly overlooked. The YCL<br />\naccuses the Administration of the University of denying<br />\nit the basic right of any group. This charge from the<br />\nYCL is not a new one, yet we still have no way of<br />\nknowing its truth. Neither affirmation nor denial of<br />\nthe charge has come from those concerned.

What is more, the<br />\nlarge flock of playgoers brought to<br />\nthe fore a definite need of the community, a play group similar to the<br />\nMercury players in New York.<br />\n'Tis true -that the city does have<br />\nvarious theatrical groups (the Vagabond Players, the Guild Theatre, etc)<br />\nbut none of them has attained a<br />\nreal measure of success<br />\n<br />\nwith the<br />\n<br />\npublic.<br />\nFortunately, however, there is such<br />\na group present right here at Johns<br />\nHopkins University. Anyone who was<br />\nfortunate enough to attend one of<br />\nthe performances of \"The Doctors\"<br />\ncertainly will agree that they possess<br />\na world of talent.

He<br />\npointed out that there has been a<br />\nsignificant change in the court, not<br />\nonly in personnel, but in jurisprudence. As examples of this change<br />\nin jurisprudence, Mr Sachs pointed<br />\nout that the minimum wage for women and children was formerly held<br />\nunconstitutional. The Court later reversed itself and implied that it had<br />\nmisconstrued the Constitution. The<br />\nCourt also formerly held that labor<br />\nconditions and industrial relations<br />\nwere matters for the states to control. Now the Federal government<br />\ncan and does exercise authority over<br />\nthese matters.<br />\nAccording to Mr Sachs this<br />\nchange in jurisprudence is not due to<br />\nthe change in the personnel of the<br />\nCourt as the ordinary laymen thinks,<br />\nbut has come about as a result of<br />\nthe scare which the President's Supreme Court bill threw into the members of the Court. Mr Sachs gave<br />\nfigures to show that, whereas the<br />\ndissenting opinions were formerly<br />\nthose of the liberals, Brandeis,<br />\nStone, and Cardoza; they were the<br />\nopinions of the conservative bloc,<br />\nButler, MacReynolds, Sutherland, and<br />\nVanDevanter after the Court plan<br />\nwas proposed.

There is too much danger<br />\nunder our present system of a large group or school<br />\nbeing left entirely unrepresented as a result of the<br />\nmachinations of our political guiding lights.<br />\nOf course, any move in this direction would involve an enlargement of membership in the Council.<br />\nWieldiness must of necessity limit the extent ,of such<br />\nchange. But the Council might well investigate a<br />\nsystem whereby all undergraduate schools are ensured<br />\nrepresentation, and each class given a representation<br />\ndeserving of its size.<br /><br />\nThe Council,<br />\na suggestion For<br />\nthe next move<br /><br />\nThe discussion centering<br />\naround the admission of a<br />\nAbstractions<br />\nNegro to the Hopkins Graduate school has as many<br />\nvs<br />\nthorny points as a cactus<br />\nsimplicity<br />\nand is just as unpleasant to<br />\nhandle. Emotional and rational considerations alike lead to stalemates or resolve<br />\nthemselves into vicious circles. Whether one argues<br />\nfinances, enrollment or the intangibles of liberalism,<br />\nproponent or opponent is right or wrong only according to original assumptions.<br />\nValidity in the debate of intangibles seems to lie<br />\nonly in the question of whether or not opposition to<br />\nadmission exists in the graduate b school. Obviously,<br />\nbecause of the not-to-be-ignored fact of close association of students in one school of a university, this-question had to be answered. And it was answered in a<br />\nrecently held poll by a large majority vote in favor<br />\nof admission.<br />\nIf the whole question were considered simply as<br />\nthe case of one Edward Lewis, qualified for admission, there would be no bogging down in a morass of<br />\nabstraction and debate. And the best way to solve<br />\nthe problem, it seems to us, is to return to simplicity,<br />\nexamine the record of Edward Lewis without regard<br />\nto his color, and forget shifty ponderables which lead<br />\nnowhere. Such a policy could result only in admission, since Mr Lewis is particularly well qualified.<br />\nIt w*uld seem that we<br />\nhaven't made ourselves<br />\nH, S, F:<br />\nquite clear on this question<br />\nof marks. We fully apprea Few<br />\nciate the need for some<br />\nwords more<br />\nmodification in our present<br />\nsystem of conveying a true<br />\nimpression of a student's record here to interested<br />\n,outsiders. It is merely the form of_the modification<br />\nadopted to which we take exception.<br />\nWe make the primary assumption that one comes<br />\nto college to get an education. There is something<br />\ndefinitely wrong with a system in which marks or<br />\nrewards, rather than knowledge, are the criteria or the<br />\nincentive to study. This despite the fact that many<br />\nare forced into holding with the former concept<br />\nthrough years of sad experience.<br />\nThe psychological effect of a material reward sys-<br /><br />\ntern is an extremely bad one, forcing an individual<br />\nconsciously or unconsciously to adopt a competitive<br />\nrather than a self-benefiting attitude. As much as<br />\npossible, the evaluation of learning on a basis of comparison must be eliminated. Taking the long view,<br />\none's marks are of no value per se. As indicators of<br />\nability they are at best questionable. Let them not,<br />\nithen, be set up in the false light of being and ending<br />\nall. If they must be, let them be as innocuous as<br />\npossible.<br />\nThe ideal system is one of no marks, or a simple<br />\npass or fail. The Hopkins had an approach to this.<br />\nUnfortunately, those men forced into a competitive<br />\nfield upon leaving the Hopkins came to much grief.<br />\nHowever, as we have stated, it is possible to deal with<br />\nthis and yet retain the effect of the H S F system. A<br />\ndetailed evaluation of each S, made a part of a transcript, achieves the purpose of affording outside schools<br />\nbasis for comparison, yet need cause the student no<br />\nconcern.<br />\nSuch a system is not so involved as might first<br />\nappear. In effect, it is already efficiently operating in<br />\nseveral departments of the University, notably chemistry. It should be accorded due consultation and<br />\nthought.<br />\nThe Board of collegiate studies has made a most<br />\nserious mistake in underevaluating the ultimate psychological effect of their proposed change. Thus in<br />\none move is shattered a principle resulting from long<br />\nyears of evolution. A further consideration might<br />\nwell be in order.<br />\nIf anything democracies<br />\ncan stomach has been<br />\ngleaned from the sorry<br />\nhash our shining republic<br />\nhas made of Spanish-American relations since 1936 it<br />\nhad better be gulped down<br />\nhurriedly and with gusto.<br />\nFor in Mexico notices of \"The Spanish Tragedy,\"<br />\nwith a new cast, have already been posted. President<br />\nCardenas is faced with an opposition which differs<br />\nfrom El Caudillo Franco's Spanish Phalanx only in<br />\nname and accessibility to foreign support. He also<br />\nfaces elections next year and if we don't miss our guess,<br />\nwe will see a recurrence of the disconcerting Mexican<br />\nhabit of using assorted lethal weapons as near the ballot box as practicable.<br />\nAs the United States turns to face south, however,<br />\nit will probably remember only one thing. Off and<br />\non for the past thirty years, Mexico has been engagedin a social revolution by which a few thousand Americans lost that sixteen million Mexicans might gain.<br />\nThe obvious advantages of having a non-fascist government in Mexico will be thrust aside while these few<br />\nthousands scream their lungs out about $69,000,00,0<br />\nin oil holdings, expropriated by the Cardenas government. Which they built up, incidentally, after Mexico's constitutional provision prohibiting foreign holdings was fearfully discarded by President Carranza in<br />\n1917, because of American imperialist threats.<br />\nAnd in all probability, there will be a carefully<br />\ncalculated waving of the red herring, as in the Spanish<br />\ncrisis. Already, in a Senate debate, Senator Reynolds<br />\nof North Carolina has proclaimed, \"Let us see about<br />\nMexico. It is Communistic, 100 per cent.
