Robinson, professor of archaeology, and officer and<br />\nmember of many- classical societies<br />\nand organizations, came into national prominence on December 31,<br />\nwhen he stated in a lecture before the Archaelogical Institute of<br />\nAmerica, in session at Haverford<br />\nCollege, that the art of caricature<br />\nwas not modern, but that it was<br />\nnoticeable in the work of the<br />\nGreeks. Vases found in recent excavations brought the subject of a<br />\nhitherto unsuspected Greek art of<br />\ncaricature to the fore. Dr. Robinson's speech was reported by the<br />\nAssociated Press throughout the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nThe ancients had \"funnies,\" he<br />\nsaid in his lecture, for one vase<br />\npicture he told about was a comical<br />\nscene of Circe handing a goblet of<br />\nwine to Ulysses. This picture, and<br />\none of Perseus cutting off the head<br />\nof the Gorgon Medusa, with another showing pigmies battling with<br />\ncranes, were created with humorous<br />\nideas in the minds of the artists,<br />\nand the inference was drawn that<br />\ncaricature was not the creation of<br />\nmodern newspaper artists, but probably the invention of early Greek<br />\nvase decorators.<br />\nDr. Robinson returned to the<br />\nUniversity after the meeting of the<br />\narchaeologists at Haverford, much<br />\namused that his statement had attracted such attention.<br />\n<br />\nBeautiful College Pennants<br />\n<br />\nJAS.

As soon as Mr.<br />\nThomson got his bearings, he began bombarding political corruption. From that day the Dispatch<br />\nbegan to grow. Its circulation<br />\nleaped from a few hundred to thousands.

Greene's<br />\nrecent article in the Alumni Magazine on \"The Nurture of Our<br />\nYouth.\" We regret that the length<br />\nof the essay requires many omissions which spoil the unity and effect of the original article:<br />\n\"About four years ago I had a<br />\nconversation with the mother of a<br />\nfreshman in one of our large universities. His entire course of<br />\nstudy she was willing to take for<br />\ngranted, with the exception of one<br />\nsubject; but in regard to this she<br />\nshowed deep concern. Will my son<br />\nhave an opportunity to study bookkeeping?' she asked. 'After he<br />\ngraduates from college he is going<br />\ninto business; and it will be very<br />\nimportant for him to know bookkeeping.' Nothing that I could say<br />\navailed in any way to arouse an<br />\ninterest in other studies. A few<br />\nmonths ago I had another conversation with this lady, whom I had<br />\nnot seen during the interval. Her<br />\nson was shortly to graduate from<br />\ncollege. He had not studied bookkeeping, but to her great gratification he had become deeply<br />\ninterested in English literature.<br />\n'When he went to college,' she said,<br />\n'he cared little for reading; now<br />\nhe is very fond of it.' She was<br />\npleased indeed that while he was in<br />\ncollege he had acquired one of the<br />\n-tastes of a cultivated man, and had<br />\ngained a never-failing resource for<br />\nthe busy years that were before<br />\nhim. Her son has gone into business, and has already won promotion; but he has had no occasion<br />\nthus far to do bookkeeping.<br />\n\"There is much truth in the saying that if a man does not read<br />\nwidely before he reaches the age of<br />\ntwenty-five, it is not probable that<br />\nhe will ever do so. This young man<br />\nhad acquired before that age the<br />\nhabit of reading. It is in the home<br />\nthat this habit is most readily and<br />\nmost naturally acquired. If the<br />\nnovels of Scott and Dickens, the<br />\npoems of Tennyson and Longfellow<br />\nare easy of access, and if a boy sees<br />\nthat the reading of his parents is<br />\nnot confined to the daily paper and<br />\nthe magazine, in most cases\u2014not<br />\nin all\u2014he will, almost without<br />\nknowing it, acquire at home the<br />\nhabit of reading.<br />\n\"The editors of the Alumni Magazine have asked me to discuss the<br />\nsubject of student reading in college. Every entering class may be<br />\ndivided broadly into two sections,<br />\none section made up of students<br />\nwho are already readers, the other<br />\nof those who are indifferent to good<br />\nreading.

As a matter of fact, the success with which one meets is most<br />\ngratifying.<br />\n\"The same class of freshmen or<br />\nof sophomores may contain students<br />\nwho have read all of the plays of<br />\nShakespeare, perhaps plays by other<br />\nElizabethan dramatists, and students who have never read one of<br />\nthe plays of Shakespeare; those<br />\nwho are fairly well acquainted with<br />\nthe course of English poetry from<br />\nSpenser to Swinburne, and who<br />\nhave themselves practiced the art<br />\nof verse, and those to whom poetry<br />\nmakes little or no appeal; some who<br />\nare familiar with the English novel<br />\nfrom Samuel Richardson to George<br />\nMeredith, and some who have never<br />\nread one of the novels of Sir Walter<br />\nScott. * * *<br />\n\"Students of various degrees of<br />\nattainment and of interest are taught<br />\ntogether in the introductory course<br />\nin English literature. Notwithstanding certain difficulties which<br />\nwill readily occur to the reader,<br />\nit is better so, for the well-read<br />\nand interested student is a help and<br />\na stimulus both to the instructor<br />\nand to the indifferent student;<br />\nmoreover, there is so much that is<br />\nnew, both in content and in point<br />\nof view, that the best-read students<br />\nare the greatest gainers.

It<br />\nis in the elective courses, however,<br />\nthat the natural readers congregate;<br />\nthese and a few conscientious students who wish to improve the opportunities to make up for deficiencies. * * *<br />\n\"It is the voluntary continuation<br />\nand extension of this practice of<br />\nprivate reading, not the reading<br />\ndone in courses, that I am to discuss. How far does the habit of<br />\nreading good literature extend<br />\namong our students? If one may<br />\njudge by the questions that are<br />\nfrequently asked about the reading<br />\nand the purchase of books, one may<br />\nsafely infer not only that a considerable number of our students read<br />\nwidely, but that many of them, before they graduate, form the nucleus of a really valuable library.<br />\nAnd if one may judge by the questions that are asked by our former<br />\nstudents, in person and by letter,<br />\nin regard to the choice of books<br />\nand of editions, one may infer that<br />\nthe library that was begun in college days continues to grow, and<br />\nthat the habit of reading, once<br />\nformed, persists even in the face<br />\nof the cares and duties of business<br />\nand professional life. The constant presence of books of this character tends to dissuade one from<br />\nindulging overmuch in reading that<br />\nwhich is trivial or ephemeral. Those<br />\nwho are in the habit of pursuing<br />\ncourses of solid reading perhaps<br />\nfail to realize how small a proportion of supposedly educated people<br />\never read to the end a book that is<br />\nnot a novel.

This is one of the reasons why I recommend the reading<br />\nof few novels during the college<br />\nyear; I recommend the reading of<br />\npoetry, from which one gets more<br />\nof literature and in a smaller compass. For many years students<br />\nhave consulted me about their summer reading, and it is then that I<br />\nrecommend the reading of the great<br />\nnovels in English. * * *<br />\n\"Years ago I met in a car one of<br />\nour professors of science who informed me that he had been reading Wordsworth of late. 'Do you<br />\nfind time to read poetry?' I asked,<br />\nknowing that he was a very busy<br />\nman. 'I must,' he replied; 'I can't<br />\nget along without it.' This story<br />\nmight be told of so many of our<br />\nfaculty that there is little likelihood<br />\nthat any of my readers will divine<br />\nto whom it actually belongs. Certainly our students cannot maintain<br />\nthat they are busier than their<br />\nteachers. It is astonishing how<br />\nmuch can be done with even a little<br />\ntime. I have frequently told my<br />\nclasses that if a man will give twenty minutes a day to the reading of<br />\nTennyson\u2014or of any other writer\u2014<br />\nat the end of a year he will know<br />\nand understand his author far better than the great majority of men.<br />\n* * *<br />\n\"When we are twenty, we have,<br />\nwe may hope, fifty years before us,<br />\ntime enough for reading everything<br />\nthat is interesting and valuable. By<br />\nthe time we are midway in life's<br />\npathway we feel that he have little<br />\ntime before us and that we have accomplished very little. It was this<br />\nfeeling, perhaps, that led Matthew<br />\nArnold to make out for every year<br />\na list of books to be read; some of<br />\nthem he did not read, some of them<br />\nhe read repeatedly. During the<br />\nwinter it is my habit to jot down<br />\nfor summer reading the titles of<br />\nbooks that I must deny myself the<br />\npleasure of reading at once. Such<br />\nlists I have made out and preserved<br />\nfor many years. They help to give<br />\none's reading a center, and to prevent it from being desultory; they<br />\nmay also prevent it from being too<br />\none-sided. On the other hand, I<br />\nowe merely to the chance that<br />\nbrought it in my way my acquaintance with one of the most interesting books that I read last summer,<br />\nLord Bryce's 'South America.'<br />\n\"As one becomes engrossed in the<br />\nduties of his profession, he will read<br />\n<br />\nTHE HUTZLER<br />\nMEN'S SHOP<br />\n<br />\nwith deep interest the biographies<br />\nEYES EXAMINED<br />\nof men who have become leaders in<br />\nhis own calling\u2014of successful lawWe carry a Complete Line of the Pop_<br />\nular fortoise Shell Speetacles<br />\nyers, physicians, engineers, teachers,<br />\nand all Accessories.<br />\nclergymen.

Robinson, professor of archaeology, and officer and<br />\nmember of many- classical societies<br />\nand organizations, came into national prominence on December 31,<br />\nwhen he stated in a lecture before the Archaelogical Institute of<br />\nAmerica, in session at Haverford<br />\nCollege, that the art of caricature<br />\nwas not modern, but that it was<br />\nnoticeable in the work of the<br />\nGreeks. Vases found in recent excavations brought the subject of a<br />\nhitherto unsuspected Greek art of<br />\ncaricature to the fore. Dr. Robinson's speech was reported by the<br />\nAssociated Press throughout the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nThe ancients had \"funnies,\" he<br />\nsaid in his lecture, for one vase<br />\npicture he told about was a comical<br />\nscene of Circe handing a goblet of<br />\nwine to Ulysses. This picture, and<br />\none of Perseus cutting off the head<br />\nof the Gorgon Medusa, with another showing pigmies battling with<br />\ncranes, were created with humorous<br />\nideas in the minds of the artists,<br />\nand the inference was drawn that<br />\ncaricature was not the creation of<br />\nmodern newspaper artists, but probably the invention of early Greek<br />\nvase decorators.<br />\nDr. Robinson returned to the<br />\nUniversity after the meeting of the<br />\narchaeologists at Haverford, much<br />\namused that his statement had attracted such attention.<br /><br />\nBeautiful College Pennants<br /><br />\nJAS.

As soon as Mr.<br />\nThomson got his bearings, he began bombarding political corruption. From that day the Dispatch<br />\nbegan to grow. Its circulation<br />\nleaped from a few hundred to thousands. His editorials and his expose of corrupt political life fanned<br />\nto a flame a revolt against \"machine\" politics and a \"Good Government\" party was born and placed<br />\nin power.

Greene's<br />\nrecent article in the Alumni Magazine on \"The Nurture of Our<br />\nYouth.\" We regret that the length<br />\nof the essay requires many omissions which spoil the unity and effect of the original article:<br />\n\"About four years ago I had a<br />\nconversation with the mother of a<br />\nfreshman in one of our large universities. His entire course of<br />\nstudy she was willing to take for<br />\ngranted, with the exception of one<br />\nsubject; but in regard to this she<br />\nshowed deep concern. Will my son<br />\nhave an opportunity to study bookkeeping?' she asked. 'After he<br />\ngraduates from college he is going<br />\ninto business; and it will be very<br />\nimportant for him to know bookkeeping.' Nothing that I could say<br />\navailed in any way to arouse an<br />\ninterest in other studies. A few<br />\nmonths ago I had another conversation with this lady, whom I had<br />\nnot seen during the interval. Her<br />\nson was shortly to graduate from<br />\ncollege. He had not studied bookkeeping, but to her great gratification he had become deeply<br />\ninterested in English literature.<br />\n'When he went to college,' she said,<br />\n'he cared little for reading; now<br />\nhe is very fond of it.' She was<br />\npleased indeed that while he was in<br />\ncollege he had acquired one of the<br />\n-tastes of a cultivated man, and had<br />\ngained a never-failing resource for<br />\nthe busy years that were before<br />\nhim. Her son has gone into business, and has already won promotion; but he has had no occasion<br />\nthus far to do bookkeeping.<br />\n\"There is much truth in the saying that if a man does not read<br />\nwidely before he reaches the age of<br />\ntwenty-five, it is not probable that<br />\nhe will ever do so. This young man<br />\nhad acquired before that age the<br />\nhabit of reading. It is in the home<br />\nthat this habit is most readily and<br />\nmost naturally acquired. If the<br />\nnovels of Scott and Dickens, the<br />\npoems of Tennyson and Longfellow<br />\nare easy of access, and if a boy sees<br />\nthat the reading of his parents is<br />\nnot confined to the daily paper and<br />\nthe magazine, in most cases\u2014not<br />\nin all\u2014he will, almost without<br />\nknowing it, acquire at home the<br />\nhabit of reading.<br />\n\"The editors of the Alumni Magazine have asked me to discuss the<br />\nsubject of student reading in college. Every entering class may be<br />\ndivided broadly into two sections,<br />\none section made up of students<br />\nwho are already readers, the other<br />\nof those who are indifferent to good<br />\nreading. For those who have already acquired the habit of reading, the instructor can best serve<br />\nas a guide and adviser who may<br />\nsave them from misdirected effort<br />\nand loss of time; for the indifferent<br />\nhe must try to open their eyes to<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, JANUARY 4, 1915.<br /><br />\nthe interest and attractiveness of<br />\ngood reading\u2014an undertaking that<br />\nto some will appear to be simple and<br />\neasy, to others perplexing and difficult.

How far does the habit of<br />\nreading good literature extend<br />\namong our students? If one may<br />\njudge by the questions that are<br />\nfrequently asked about the reading<br />\nand the purchase of books, one may<br />\nsafely infer not only that a considerable number of our students read<br />\nwidely, but that many of them, before they graduate, form the nucleus of a really valuable library.<br />\nAnd if one may judge by the questions that are asked by our former<br />\nstudents, in person and by letter,<br />\nin regard to the choice of books<br />\nand of editions, one may infer that<br />\nthe library that was begun in college days continues to grow, and<br />\nthat the habit of reading, once<br />\nformed, persists even in the face<br />\nof the cares and duties of business<br />\nand professional life. The constant presence of books of this character tends to dissuade one from<br />\nindulging overmuch in reading that<br />\nwhich is trivial or ephemeral. Those<br />\nwho are in the habit of pursuing<br />\ncourses of solid reading perhaps<br />\nfail to realize how small a proportion of supposedly educated people<br />\never read to the end a book that is<br />\nnot a novel.

This is one of the reasons why I recommend the reading<br />\nof few novels during the college<br />\nyear; I recommend the reading of<br />\npoetry, from which one gets more<br />\nof literature and in a smaller compass. For many years students<br />\nhave consulted me about their summer reading, and it is then that I<br />\nrecommend the reading of the great<br />\nnovels in English. * * *<br />\n\"Years ago I met in a car one of<br />\nour professors of science who informed me that he had been reading Wordsworth of late. 'Do you<br />\nfind time to read poetry?' I asked,<br />\nknowing that he was a very busy<br />\nman. 'I must,' he replied; 'I can't<br />\nget along without it.' This story<br />\nmight be told of so many of our<br />\nfaculty that there is little likelihood<br />\nthat any of my readers will divine<br />\nto whom it actually belongs. Certainly our students cannot maintain<br />\nthat they are busier than their<br />\nteachers. It is astonishing how<br />\nmuch can be done with even a little<br />\ntime. I have frequently told my<br />\nclasses that if a man will give twenty minutes a day to the reading of<br />\nTennyson\u2014or of any other writer\u2014<br />\nat the end of a year he will know<br />\nand understand his author far better than the great majority of men.<br />\n* * *<br />\n\"When we are twenty, we have,<br />\nwe may hope, fifty years before us,<br />\ntime enough for reading everything<br />\nthat is interesting and valuable. By<br />\nthe time we are midway in life's<br />\npathway we feel that he have little<br />\ntime before us and that we have accomplished very little. It was this<br />\nfeeling, perhaps, that led Matthew<br />\nArnold to make out for every year<br />\na list of books to be read; some of<br />\nthem he did not read, some of them<br />\nhe read repeatedly. During the<br />\nwinter it is my habit to jot down<br />\nfor summer reading the titles of<br />\nbooks that I must deny myself the<br />\npleasure of reading at once. Such<br />\nlists I have made out and preserved<br />\nfor many years. They help to give<br />\none's reading a center, and to prevent it from being desultory; they<br />\nmay also prevent it from being too<br />\none-sided. On the other hand, I<br />\nowe merely to the chance that<br />\nbrought it in my way my acquaintance with one of the most interesting books that I read last summer,<br />\nLord Bryce's 'South America.'<br />\n\"As one becomes engrossed in the<br />\nduties of his profession, he will read<br /><br />\nTHE HUTZLER<br />\nMEN'S SHOP<br /><br />\nwith deep interest the biographies<br />\nEYES EXAMINED<br />\nof men who have become leaders in<br />\nhis own calling\u2014of successful lawWe carry a Complete Line of the Pop_<br />\nular fortoise Shell Speetacles<br />\nyers, physicians, engineers, teachers,<br />\nand all Accessories.<br />\nclergymen.
