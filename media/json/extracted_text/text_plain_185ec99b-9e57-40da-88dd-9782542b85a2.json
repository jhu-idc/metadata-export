In fact, the language is so arcane to most Americans that Esperanto appears<br />\nalmost weekly as a $1000 question in the double jeopardy round of Jeopardy.. .(it's usually the question no one gets.)<br />\nSo, what is Esperanto?<br />\nIt's a language created in 1887 by Dr. L.L.<br />\nZamenhof as a solution to the problem of international communication. Esperanto is spoken<br />\ntoday by more than one million people around<br />\nthe world. As the language has gained popularity, it has become increasingly useful as a<br />\nlanguage of choice for those who travel, conduct business overseas, or interest themselves<br />\nin intercultural communication.<br />\nThe reason for Esperanto's success is a simple one. The language is remarkably easy to<br />\nlearn and use. Unlike \"natural languages\" (like<br />\nFrench, English, German, or Chinese) which<br />\nrequire years of study for proficiency, Esperanto can be learned almost overnight. The grammar is governed by sixteen rules which are simple, elegant, and easy to master. Pronunciation<br />\nis completely determined by spelling. And the<br />\nvocabulary is based on Indo-European roots<br />\nwhich, for the most part, will seem familiar to<br />\nanyone who speaks an Indo-European tongue.<br />\nIn addition, Esperanto's success as a functional language for cross-cultural communication has been enhanced by its neutrality. Unlike<br />\nall natural languages, Esperanto is not the<br />\nmother tongue of any particular nation or ethnic<br />\ngroup. It is instead a culturally-neutral second<br />\nlanguage for all nations.<br />\nSo, one might wonder what Esperanto has<br />\n<br />\nbody and administration have<br />\nheard pleas from the Coalition for<br />\na Free South Africa for freedom<br />\nof expression, the right to voice<br />\ntheir opinions without being<br />\ndrowned out or censored,<br />\nwhether in public or via the<br />\n\"mysterious disappearance\" of<br />\nposters and other literature.

For the real question<br />\nwas not whether the student had<br />\nprovoked an attack, but rather<br />\nwhat kind of intolerance would<br />\nlead someone to physically<br />\nassault another person for merely publicizing his viewpoints.<br />\nFor many months the student<br />\n<br />\nsociety; that the lone dissenter is<br />\nnot necessarily wrong and should<br />\nindeed be encouraged to speak his<br />\nmind as to his doubts, uncertainties, and discomfort with the<br />\npolicies of society.<br />\nUnfortunately, given the current atmosphere of antagonism<br />\nand intolerance, it is doubtful<br />\nwhether the following scenario<br />\ncould occur:<br />\nImagine that a group of<br />\nstudents wished to picket Shriver<br />\nHall in a peaceful and nondisruptive manner. Without being<br />\noffensive or resorting to mudslinging or interfering in the<br />\nUniversity's functioning, the<br />\nstudents attempted to voice their<br />\nopinions but were hauled off by<br />\ncampus security. With barely a<br />\npause long enough for the Administration to catch its collective<br />\nbreath, a conservative student<br />\ngroup, while in disagreement<br />\nwith the protesters, nevertheless<br />\nlodges a formal complaint against<br />\nthe suppression of the protest for<br />\nno reasonable cause, and<br />\ndemands that the opposition be<br />\nheard.<br />\nPart of the reason this ideal is<br />\n<br />\nto do with Hopkins. Unfortunately, at the moment there is no strong connection. Like almost<br />\nevery other college and university in this country, Hopkins does not teach Esperanto. In fact,<br />\nright now there is only a handful of universities<br />\nin the country that offer Esperanto (usually irContinued on Page 8<br />\nregularly during summer sessions).<br />\nHopkins now has the opportunity to take the<br />\nlead in ending American ignorance of Esperanto.

A few sniggers are heard. \"O.K., maybe<br />\nshe has joyful expectations of<br />\nsomething else! But you're all<br />\nplaying like she's eight months<br />\nexpectant!\" The orchestra bursts<br />\ninto laughter. \"Keep it light and<br />\nsprightly, please!\" After a good<br />\nlaugh, the orchestra has no trouble achieving a happy mood in the<br />\nmusic.<br />\nOverhauser is an experienced<br />\nand well educated conductor who<br />\nknows how to get the most out of<br />\nthis volunteer orchestra of<br />\ncommunity<br />\nstudents and<br />\nmembers. She.has struck an effective balance between supportiveness and toughness: one<br />\nminute she stops the orchestra to<br />\ncompliment it profusely, the next<br />\nminute she is informing an underpracticed trombone player that he<br />\ncan be replaced. Overhauser has<br />\nstudied in Munich, Vienna, Rome<br />\nand Siena, and got her diploma di<br />\nperfezionamente in conducting<br />\nfrom Rome's Accademia Nazionale de Santa Cecilia, her<br />\nMasters in conducting from Indiana School of Music, and her<br />\ndoctorate from Peabody. She is<br />\nthe assistant conductor of the<br />\nAspen Music Festival and often<br />\nguest conducts for Res Musica<br />\nBaltimore, the Orchestra Society<br />\nof Philadelphia and the Chamber<br />\nEnsemble of New York. She is<br />\nclearly the kind of person that<br />\n<br />\ntries to get the best out of herself<br />\nand expects the same from others.<br />\nIn 1981, Overhauser returned<br />\nto the U.S. from Europe in order<br />\nto get her doctorate at Peabody.<br />\nShe noticed that orchestral music<br />\ngroups at Hopkins were not very<br />\nwell organized and were very<br />\nshort-lived. The idea for the HSO<br />\nwas born\u2014an orchestra of student<br />\nand community amateurs led by<br />\na professional conductor/music<br />\ndirector, general manager, personnel manager, and stage<br />\nmanager. Also, in a recent innovation requested by the orchestra, expert musicians are paid<br />\nto lead each instrumental section,<br />\nto provide coaching, and to run<br />\nintensive section rehearsals.<br />\n\"Because we use community<br />\nmembers as musicians and also<br />\nhave a professional managing<br />\nboard, we are not an SAC<br />\ngroup,\" explains Overhauser.<br />\nThe orchestra receives support<br />\nfrom the University, but raises<br />\nthe majority of its funds. Money<br />\ncomes from donations, advertisements in the programs, and<br />\ngrants from sources like the<br />\nPeggy and Yale Gordon Trust,<br />\nthe Hopkins Alumni Association,<br />\nand the Maryland Arts Council.<br />\nA new source of revenue for<br />\nthe orchestra is ticket sales. The<br />\nconcerts used to be free to the<br />\npublic. In an audience survey two<br />\nand a half years ago,95% of concert goers said that they would<br />\nnot mind paying a small ticket<br />\nprice to help support the orchestra. The concerts are still free<br />\nto Hopkins students, though, and<br />\nthere is a lower rate for senior<br />\ncitizens.<br />\nOverhauser is very proud that<br />\nthe HSO has brought together a<br />\nwide range of people interested in<br />\nmaking music. \"This year we<br />\nhave two people from mainland<br />\n<br />\nChina, one from Japan, and one<br />\nfrom Belgium. We have very<br />\nyoung people and more mature<br />\npeople. For example, we have<br />\ntwo extremely talented French<br />\nhorn players from a local high<br />\nschool. We also have violist Dr.<br />\nBarbara Betz, a very distinguished psychiatrist who is now<br />\nretired, and double-bassist Tom<br />\nButler, who owns his own<br />\nacoustics consulting firm.\" Many<br />\nof the orchestra members are<br />\ndoctors, engineers, and music<br />\nstudents.<br />\nHSO violist Paul Nelson<br />\ndesigns radar for Westinghouse.<br />\nHe is also an aspiring chamber<br />\nmusic composer. \"My ideas<br />\ncome all the time, like when I'm<br />\nabout to fall asleep, or when I'm<br />\nin the shower. When I think<br />\nsomething is neat I write it down.<br />\nIt could be notes, a structure, or<br />\nwords. Then, after it builds up for<br />\na while, I put a piece together,<br />\nlike a puzzle.\" The HSO is sponsoring a performance of Nelson's<br />\nString Quartet -1 as one of the<br />\nthree chamber concerts it will be<br />\npresenting this year. Nelson says<br />\nthe quartet is an original mix of<br />\nstyles, but has many echoes of his<br />\nfavorite chamber music composers: Dvorak, Brahms,<br />\nand<br />\nBeethoven, Janacek<br />\nVaughan-Williams. Nelson has<br />\nbeen taking private viola lessons<br />\nsince the age of seven, and started<br />\ncomposing at age 14. When he attended the University of<br />\nDelaware, he got plenty of<br />\nquartet coaching from the resident Delos Quartet. \"Music is a<br />\nbig part of my life. I intend to<br />\nkeep it up and really make a<br />\ncontribution.\"<br />\nCyndie Katsarelis is a Peabody<br />\ngraduate student earning her<br />\nMasters in conducting. She is the<br />\nleader of the second violin sec-<br />\n<br />\n-tion, a paid position which she got<br />\nby competing in open auditions<br />\nheld by Overhauser. Katsarelis likes playing for the HSO<br />\nbecause she does things which<br />\nwill help her later in her career.<br />\n\"Here I get to be the principal<br />\n(the first chair player), and I get<br />\nto lead section rehearsals. Upon<br />\noccasion, Catherine (Overhauser)<br />\nwill have me conduct an orchestra<br />\nrehearsal. I'm learning how to<br />\nverbalize what I want.\" Katsarelis does not mind working<br />\n<br />\n1111V1<br />\nLL<br />\nLLG&E<br />\nwith amateurs who have varying<br />\ndegrees of ability. \"These are intelligent people, just not professionals. They can still make<br />\nwonderful music. You just have<br />\nto ask them differently, that's<br />\nall.\" After this HSO season, Katsarelis will go to Ann Arbor,<br />\nMichigan to become the assistant<br />\nconductor of the national Arts<br />\nChamber Orchestra.<br />\nAnd, of course, there are<br />\nHopkins students in the orchestra,<br />\nlike sophomore physics major<br />\n<br />\nThe Flip Side:<br />\n<br />\nSusan Stolovy. She took private<br />\nlessons while living in Rockville,<br />\nMaryland, and now studies at<br />\nPeabody. \"I can't imagine not<br />\nbeing in an orchestra!\" says this<br />\nveteran of county and All State<br />\norchestras. The HSO came to her<br />\nattention in her freshman<br />\nrecruiting literature, and she signed up immediately. Stolovy also<br />\nhad a strong desire to play in a<br />\nstring quartet. \"If there wasn't<br />\none here for me to join, I was going to form one!\" That's exactly<br />\nwhat she did, recruiting fellow<br />\nHSO members to form the<br />\nHopkins Quartet. Stolovy and the<br />\nquartet will appear in an HSO<br />\nsponsored chamber music concert, and also frequently play at<br />\nHopkins talent shows.<br />\nConductor Overhauser has<br />\nseveral goals for the HSO. She<br />\nwants to build up a core of<br />\ndedicated people, so that there is<br />\na consistent artistic level. Also<br />\nimportant to her is presenting new<br />\nmusic to the Baltimore area. The<br />\nHSO has commissioned pieces<br />\nfrom local composers Judith<br />\nLang-Zaimont and Elam Ray<br />\nSprenkle. In an interesting twist,<br />\ncomposer Bob Schnyder has<br />\nhired the orchestra to record<br />\nsome of his works for a demo<br />\ntape. Overhauser also thinks it is<br />\nimportant to touch the community. She especially enjoys bringing<br />\nmusic to handicapped children.<br />\nFor several years, the orchestra<br />\nhas presented bi-annual concerts<br />\nto the Maryland School for the<br />\nBlind. Orchestra members go into the audience afterwards to let<br />\nthe children feel the instruments<br />\nand attempt to play them. This<br />\nyear, the orchestra will appear at<br />\nthe Ruxton/Ridge School for the<br />\nHandicapped as well. The HSO<br />\nwill continue to appear at the Mt.<br />\nVernon Festival and perform<br />\nHandel's Messiah at local churChristmas.<br />\nevery<br />\nches<br />\nOverhauser is hoping that the orchestra will become so well<br />\nknown \"that people won't be able<br />\nto imagine Hopkins without us!\"<br />\n<br />\nTeigham Cures Insomnia<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\nIt is a sad state of affairs indeed, when a rock-and-roll<br />\nreviewin' guy like me ends up<br />\nreviewing New Age albums.<br />\nOkay, so I'm reviewing these<br />\ntwo albums\u2014Between Two<br />\nWorlds by Patrick O'Hearn, and<br />\nSafety in Numbers by David Van<br />\nTeighem (both on the Private<br />\nMusic label). Before I review<br />\nthese albums, however, I should<br />\ninform you of my bias\u2014I have,<br />\nusually, considered most New<br />\nAge music to be a blight on music<br />\nin general (note all the qualifiers).<br />\nI have never understood why people would want to buy synthesized muzak, music they just put on<br />\nto ignore. Now that you know<br />\nwhere I'm coming from, let's<br />\nhave at these mothers.<br />\nBetween Two Worlds does lit-<br />\n<br />\ntle to qualm my feelings regarding New Age music. O'Hearn is<br />\nthe former synthesist for Missing<br />\nPersons, so you would expect<br />\nhim to have a way with a nice<br />\nmelody, and be able to compose<br />\nan interesting piece. He doesn't,<br />\nand he can't. O'Hearn tries to<br />\ncreate a mood album\u2014alternating<br />\nbetween somber and cheerful-and<br />\nhe does, to a degree, succeed.<br />\nThis, however, doesn't keep this<br />\nalbum from being a real Z'sinducer. O'Hearn is concerned<br />\nprimarily with the use of sounds<br />\n(I've a sampler, and I'm going to<br />\nuse it!), and shows little interest<br />\nin musical structure. While his<br />\nsounds are, at times, interesting,<br />\nthis isn't enough to really support<br />\nthe album. There is also no unity<br />\nbetween the songs, each one being forced to stand on its own. If<br />\nO'Hearn had given us a little<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\nmore-a repeated leitmotif with<br />\nvariations, for example\u2014to link<br />\nthese pieces together, then this<br />\nwould have been a stronger<br />\nalbum. Sad to say, I wouldn't<br />\nrecommend that anybody pay<br />\nthau much for it\u2014wait till it his<br />\nthe cut-out bin, and if it doesn't,<br />\nno loss.<br />\nOkay, now that we've<br />\ndemolished him, let's get Van<br />\nTeighem. Surprise, surprise\u2014I<br />\nliked this album! Van Teighem is<br />\na percussionist who has played<br />\nwith the likes of Laurie Anderson. He has also composed music<br />\nfor various stage productions.<br />\nThus, we can assume he knows<br />\nwhat he's doing. He does. With<br />\na percussionist's sense of rhythm,<br />\nand a full-fledged composer's<br />\nmusical ability, Van Teighem<br />\ncreates an interesting and surprising aural world for the listener to<br />\n<br />\nexplore. Van Teighem, like 'dance) productions. Thus, we're<br />\nO'Hearn, is big on synthesizers cut off from that other dimension<br />\nand samplers-the production which should logically accomcredits list virtually every syn- pany the piece\u2014the visual.<br />\nthesizer I've ever hear of, and Though they are interesting, they<br />\nthen some. Unlike O'Hearn, lack the impact they must have<br />\nhowever, Van Teighem uses his originally had, and they are punsounds as more than sounds\u2014 tuating breaks in the albums unithey become the orchestral in- ty.

Nor had<br />\nmy father, who lived through the<br />\nWar in a labor camp in Rumania.<br />\nWhy was Sobibor such a wellkept secret? As the story was<br />\ntold, Sobibor was a death camp<br />\nwhere trainloads of Jews were<br />\nsent to the gas chambers (\"the<br />\nshowers\") every day. The only<br />\nones who escaped immediate<br />\ndeath were the skilled Jews\u2014<br />\nseamstresses, tailors, goldsmiths,<br />\nshoemakers, etc. These Jews<br />\nwere forced to work for the<br />\nNazis, but were allowed to gather<br />\ntogether at night. A group of<br />\nthese Jews masterminded the plan<br />\nof escape.<br />\nAfter witnessing the execution<br />\nof 26 of their brethren as penalty<br />\nfor the escape of two, they for-<br />\n<br />\nmulated a plan that would include<br />\neach of the 600 prisoners in the<br />\ncamp. The goldsmiths managed<br />\nto make knives and the treecutters<br />\nstole axes; and one by one, the<br />\nkey SS officers were eliminated.<br />\nThis left only the Ukrainian<br />\nguards, the \"brawn without<br />\nbrains\" as the Jews called them.<br />\nIn that situation, the guards were<br />\nconfused, and the prisoners ran<br />\nout the front gates. Many of them<br />\nwere shot, but over 300 made it<br />\nto safety.<br />\nThis inspirational story of<br />\ncourage and determination should<br />\nnot be a secret, but should be told<br />\nagain and again. It belies the image so many have that all Jews<br />\nwalked to their death like sheep<br />\nin the Holocaust. It shows that the<br />\nuniting of minds and souls can<br />\nbring success and dent if not<br />\ndestroy tyranny such as that of the<br />\nNazis.

More importantly,<br />\nhis Jays will be facing a Midshipman squad that may be tough to<br />\nbeat.<br />\nHopkins has generally played<br />\nwell against the big name teams,<br />\nspecifically Carolina, Syracuse<br />\nand Maryland (for three quarters). Against middling squads<br />\nsuch as Army and Rutgers, the<br />\nJays have had to turn it on in the<br />\nfourth quarter to win. If the same<br />\nhappens tomorrow, it could mean<br />\ntrouble because Navy is better<br />\nthan both of them.<br />\nThe Middies come into the<br />\ngame with an 8-2 record, fresh<br />\noff a 15-13 win at Virginia last<br />\nSaturday. They're solid all<br />\naround, particularly up front<br />\nwhere their young attack is<br />\nreminiscent of the Jays of two<br />\nyears ago. Sophomores Paul<br />\nBasile and Tom Hanzche team<br />\nwith freshman Mike Herger to<br />\nlead the Middies to an over 12<br />\n<br />\ngoals per game average. The<br />\nteam tleaders are midfielder and<br />\nsenior captain Bob Wehman and<br />\ngoalie Joe Donnelly, who<br />\nfrustrated the Jays in Annapolis<br />\nlast season.<br />\nTo win, the Jays must avoid a<br />\nletdown after last week's disappointment. They were sky high<br />\nagainst Maryland, and nearly<br />\npulled off a major upset. This<br />\nweek, they'll have to maintain<br />\nsome of that intensity, because<br />\nNavy is too good to beat with a<br />\nsubpar effort. It's the Middies'<br />\nlast game, and their most important one at that. A win at Hopkins<br />\nlocks up at least the fourth seed,<br />\nwhich means a first-round bye<br />\nand then home field advantage.<br />\nOne way to analyze tomorrow's game is to look at the common opponents the two schools<br />\nhave faced, of which there are<br />\nsix. Both teams snuck by Army<br />\nand Rutgers. Hopkins routed<br />\nWashington College and<br />\nPrinceton and kept Maryland<br />\nclose, while Navy had a little<br />\ntrouble with Washington and<br />\nPrinceton, and lost big to the<br />\nTerps. On the other side of the<br />\ncoin, the Middies beat Virginia,<br />\nwhile the Jays lost to the Cavs.<br />\n<br />\nAll this trivial data points to a<br />\nslight Blue Jay edge.<br />\nAs for the other top teams,<br />\nMaryland is idle over the<br />\nvisits<br />\nweekend, Cornell<br />\nPrinceton, UMass travels to Army, and Syracuse hosts Rutgers.<br />\nThe most intriguing battle takes<br />\nplace in Charlottesville, Va.,<br />\nwhere Carolina takes on Virginia.<br />\nWhat a difference a year<br />\nmakes.

This is their<br />\nregular season finale, so even if<br />\nthey lose, they'll probably still get<br />\nan invite. Virginia, on the other<br />\nhand, must win or else they're<br />\nfinished.

In fact, the language is so arcane to most Americans that Esperanto appears<br />\nalmost weekly as a $1000 question in the double jeopardy round of Jeopardy.. .(it's usually the question no one gets.)<br />\nSo, what is Esperanto?<br />\nIt's a language created in 1887 by Dr. L.L.<br />\nZamenhof as a solution to the problem of international communication. Esperanto is spoken<br />\ntoday by more than one million people around<br />\nthe world. As the language has gained popularity, it has become increasingly useful as a<br />\nlanguage of choice for those who travel, conduct business overseas, or interest themselves<br />\nin intercultural communication.<br />\nThe reason for Esperanto's success is a simple one. The language is remarkably easy to<br />\nlearn and use. Unlike \"natural languages\" (like<br />\nFrench, English, German, or Chinese) which<br />\nrequire years of study for proficiency, Esperanto can be learned almost overnight. The grammar is governed by sixteen rules which are simple, elegant, and easy to master. Pronunciation<br />\nis completely determined by spelling. And the<br />\nvocabulary is based on Indo-European roots<br />\nwhich, for the most part, will seem familiar to<br />\nanyone who speaks an Indo-European tongue.<br />\nIn addition, Esperanto's success as a functional language for cross-cultural communication has been enhanced by its neutrality. Unlike<br />\nall natural languages, Esperanto is not the<br />\nmother tongue of any particular nation or ethnic<br />\ngroup.

For the real question<br />\nwas not whether the student had<br />\nprovoked an attack, but rather<br />\nwhat kind of intolerance would<br />\nlead someone to physically<br />\nassault another person for merely publicizing his viewpoints.<br />\nFor many months the student<br /><br />\nsociety; that the lone dissenter is<br />\nnot necessarily wrong and should<br />\nindeed be encouraged to speak his<br />\nmind as to his doubts, uncertainties, and discomfort with the<br />\npolicies of society.<br />\nUnfortunately, given the current atmosphere of antagonism<br />\nand intolerance, it is doubtful<br />\nwhether the following scenario<br />\ncould occur:<br />\nImagine that a group of<br />\nstudents wished to picket Shriver<br />\nHall in a peaceful and nondisruptive manner. Without being<br />\noffensive or resorting to mudslinging or interfering in the<br />\nUniversity's functioning, the<br />\nstudents attempted to voice their<br />\nopinions but were hauled off by<br />\ncampus security. With barely a<br />\npause long enough for the Administration to catch its collective<br />\nbreath, a conservative student<br />\ngroup, while in disagreement<br />\nwith the protesters, nevertheless<br />\nlodges a formal complaint against<br />\nthe suppression of the protest for<br />\nno reasonable cause, and<br />\ndemands that the opposition be<br />\nheard.<br />\nPart of the reason this ideal is<br /><br />\nto do with Hopkins. Unfortunately, at the moment there is no strong connection. Like almost<br />\nevery other college and university in this country, Hopkins does not teach Esperanto.

A few sniggers are heard. \"O.K., maybe<br />\nshe has joyful expectations of<br />\nsomething else! But you're all<br />\nplaying like she's eight months<br />\nexpectant!\" The orchestra bursts<br />\ninto laughter. \"Keep it light and<br />\nsprightly, please!\" After a good<br />\nlaugh, the orchestra has no trouble achieving a happy mood in the<br />\nmusic.<br />\nOverhauser is an experienced<br />\nand well educated conductor who<br />\nknows how to get the most out of<br />\nthis volunteer orchestra of<br />\ncommunity<br />\nstudents and<br />\nmembers. She.has struck an effective balance between supportiveness and toughness: one<br />\nminute she stops the orchestra to<br />\ncompliment it profusely, the next<br />\nminute she is informing an underpracticed trombone player that he<br />\ncan be replaced. Overhauser has<br />\nstudied in Munich, Vienna, Rome<br />\nand Siena, and got her diploma di<br />\nperfezionamente in conducting<br />\nfrom Rome's Accademia Nazionale de Santa Cecilia, her<br />\nMasters in conducting from Indiana School of Music, and her<br />\ndoctorate from Peabody. She is<br />\nthe assistant conductor of the<br />\nAspen Music Festival and often<br />\nguest conducts for Res Musica<br />\nBaltimore, the Orchestra Society<br />\nof Philadelphia and the Chamber<br />\nEnsemble of New York. She is<br />\nclearly the kind of person that<br /><br />\ntries to get the best out of herself<br />\nand expects the same from others.<br />\nIn 1981, Overhauser returned<br />\nto the U.S. from Europe in order<br />\nto get her doctorate at Peabody.<br />\nShe noticed that orchestral music<br />\ngroups at Hopkins were not very<br />\nwell organized and were very<br />\nshort-lived. The idea for the HSO<br />\nwas born\u2014an orchestra of student<br />\nand community amateurs led by<br />\na professional conductor/music<br />\ndirector, general manager, personnel manager, and stage<br />\nmanager. Also, in a recent innovation requested by the orchestra, expert musicians are paid<br />\nto lead each instrumental section,<br />\nto provide coaching, and to run<br />\nintensive section rehearsals.<br />\n\"Because we use community<br />\nmembers as musicians and also<br />\nhave a professional managing<br />\nboard, we are not an SAC<br />\ngroup,\" explains Overhauser.<br />\nThe orchestra receives support<br />\nfrom the University, but raises<br />\nthe majority of its funds. Money<br />\ncomes from donations, advertisements in the programs, and<br />\ngrants from sources like the<br />\nPeggy and Yale Gordon Trust,<br />\nthe Hopkins Alumni Association,<br />\nand the Maryland Arts Council.<br />\nA new source of revenue for<br />\nthe orchestra is ticket sales. The<br />\nconcerts used to be free to the<br />\npublic. In an audience survey two<br />\nand a half years ago,95% of concert goers said that they would<br />\nnot mind paying a small ticket<br />\nprice to help support the orchestra. The concerts are still free<br />\nto Hopkins students, though, and<br />\nthere is a lower rate for senior<br />\ncitizens.<br />\nOverhauser is very proud that<br />\nthe HSO has brought together a<br />\nwide range of people interested in<br />\nmaking music. \"This year we<br />\nhave two people from mainland<br /><br />\nChina, one from Japan, and one<br />\nfrom Belgium. We have very<br />\nyoung people and more mature<br />\npeople. For example, we have<br />\ntwo extremely talented French<br />\nhorn players from a local high<br />\nschool. We also have violist Dr.<br />\nBarbara Betz, a very distinguished psychiatrist who is now<br />\nretired, and double-bassist Tom<br />\nButler, who owns his own<br />\nacoustics consulting firm.\" Many<br />\nof the orchestra members are<br />\ndoctors, engineers, and music<br />\nstudents.<br />\nHSO violist Paul Nelson<br />\ndesigns radar for Westinghouse.<br />\nHe is also an aspiring chamber<br />\nmusic composer. \"My ideas<br />\ncome all the time, like when I'm<br />\nabout to fall asleep, or when I'm<br />\nin the shower. When I think<br />\nsomething is neat I write it down.<br />\nIt could be notes, a structure, or<br />\nwords. Then, after it builds up for<br />\na while, I put a piece together,<br />\nlike a puzzle.\" The HSO is sponsoring a performance of Nelson's<br />\nString Quartet -1 as one of the<br />\nthree chamber concerts it will be<br />\npresenting this year. Nelson says<br />\nthe quartet is an original mix of<br />\nstyles, but has many echoes of his<br />\nfavorite chamber music composers: Dvorak, Brahms,<br />\nand<br />\nBeethoven, Janacek<br />\nVaughan-Williams. Nelson has<br />\nbeen taking private viola lessons<br />\nsince the age of seven, and started<br />\ncomposing at age 14. When he attended the University of<br />\nDelaware, he got plenty of<br />\nquartet coaching from the resident Delos Quartet. \"Music is a<br />\nbig part of my life. I intend to<br />\nkeep it up and really make a<br />\ncontribution.\"<br />\nCyndie Katsarelis is a Peabody<br />\ngraduate student earning her<br />\nMasters in conducting. She is the<br />\nleader of the second violin sec-<br /><br />\n-tion, a paid position which she got<br />\nby competing in open auditions<br />\nheld by Overhauser. Katsarelis likes playing for the HSO<br />\nbecause she does things which<br />\nwill help her later in her career.<br />\n\"Here I get to be the principal<br />\n(the first chair player), and I get<br />\nto lead section rehearsals. Upon<br />\noccasion, Catherine (Overhauser)<br />\nwill have me conduct an orchestra<br />\nrehearsal. I'm learning how to<br />\nverbalize what I want.\" Katsarelis does not mind working<br /><br />\n1111V1<br />\nLL<br />\nLLG&amp;E<br />\nwith amateurs who have varying<br />\ndegrees of ability. \"These are intelligent people, just not professionals. They can still make<br />\nwonderful music. You just have<br />\nto ask them differently, that's<br />\nall.\" After this HSO season, Katsarelis will go to Ann Arbor,<br />\nMichigan to become the assistant<br />\nconductor of the national Arts<br />\nChamber Orchestra.<br />\nAnd, of course, there are<br />\nHopkins students in the orchestra,<br />\nlike sophomore physics major<br /><br />\nThe Flip Side:<br /><br />\nSusan Stolovy. She took private<br />\nlessons while living in Rockville,<br />\nMaryland, and now studies at<br />\nPeabody. \"I can't imagine not<br />\nbeing in an orchestra!\" says this<br />\nveteran of county and All State<br />\norchestras. The HSO came to her<br />\nattention in her freshman<br />\nrecruiting literature, and she signed up immediately. Stolovy also<br />\nhad a strong desire to play in a<br />\nstring quartet. \"If there wasn't<br />\none here for me to join, I was going to form one!\" That's exactly<br />\nwhat she did, recruiting fellow<br />\nHSO members to form the<br />\nHopkins Quartet. Stolovy and the<br />\nquartet will appear in an HSO<br />\nsponsored chamber music concert, and also frequently play at<br />\nHopkins talent shows.<br />\nConductor Overhauser has<br />\nseveral goals for the HSO. She<br />\nwants to build up a core of<br />\ndedicated people, so that there is<br />\na consistent artistic level. Also<br />\nimportant to her is presenting new<br />\nmusic to the Baltimore area. The<br />\nHSO has commissioned pieces<br />\nfrom local composers Judith<br />\nLang-Zaimont and Elam Ray<br />\nSprenkle. In an interesting twist,<br />\ncomposer Bob Schnyder has<br />\nhired the orchestra to record<br />\nsome of his works for a demo<br />\ntape. Overhauser also thinks it is<br />\nimportant to touch the community. She especially enjoys bringing<br />\nmusic to handicapped children.<br />\nFor several years, the orchestra<br />\nhas presented bi-annual concerts<br />\nto the Maryland School for the<br />\nBlind. Orchestra members go into the audience afterwards to let<br />\nthe children feel the instruments<br />\nand attempt to play them. This<br />\nyear, the orchestra will appear at<br />\nthe Ruxton/Ridge School for the<br />\nHandicapped as well. The HSO<br />\nwill continue to appear at the Mt.<br />\nVernon Festival and perform<br />\nHandel's Messiah at local churChristmas.<br />\nevery<br />\nches<br />\nOverhauser is hoping that the orchestra will become so well<br />\nknown \"that people won't be able<br />\nto imagine Hopkins without us!\"<br /><br />\nTeigham Cures Insomnia<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\nIt is a sad state of affairs indeed, when a rock-and-roll<br />\nreviewin' guy like me ends up<br />\nreviewing New Age albums.<br />\nOkay, so I'm reviewing these<br />\ntwo albums\u2014Between Two<br />\nWorlds by Patrick O'Hearn, and<br />\nSafety in Numbers by David Van<br />\nTeighem (both on the Private<br />\nMusic label). Before I review<br />\nthese albums, however, I should<br />\ninform you of my bias\u2014I have,<br />\nusually, considered most New<br />\nAge music to be a blight on music<br />\nin general (note all the qualifiers).<br />\nI have never understood why people would want to buy synthesized muzak, music they just put on<br />\nto ignore. Now that you know<br />\nwhere I'm coming from, let's<br />\nhave at these mothers.<br />\nBetween Two Worlds does lit-<br /><br />\ntle to qualm my feelings regarding New Age music. O'Hearn is<br />\nthe former synthesist for Missing<br />\nPersons, so you would expect<br />\nhim to have a way with a nice<br />\nmelody, and be able to compose<br />\nan interesting piece. He doesn't,<br />\nand he can't. O'Hearn tries to<br />\ncreate a mood album\u2014alternating<br />\nbetween somber and cheerful-and<br />\nhe does, to a degree, succeed.<br />\nThis, however, doesn't keep this<br />\nalbum from being a real Z'sinducer. O'Hearn is concerned<br />\nprimarily with the use of sounds<br />\n(I've a sampler, and I'm going to<br />\nuse it!), and shows little interest<br />\nin musical structure. While his<br />\nsounds are, at times, interesting,<br />\nthis isn't enough to really support<br />\nthe album. There is also no unity<br />\nbetween the songs, each one being forced to stand on its own. If<br />\nO'Hearn had given us a little<br /><br />\n_<br />\nmore-a repeated leitmotif with<br />\nvariations, for example\u2014to link<br />\nthese pieces together, then this<br />\nwould have been a stronger<br />\nalbum. Sad to say, I wouldn't<br />\nrecommend that anybody pay<br />\nthau much for it\u2014wait till it his<br />\nthe cut-out bin, and if it doesn't,<br />\nno loss.<br />\nOkay, now that we've<br />\ndemolished him, let's get Van<br />\nTeighem. Surprise, surprise\u2014I<br />\nliked this album! Van Teighem is<br />\na percussionist who has played<br />\nwith the likes of Laurie Anderson. He has also composed music<br />\nfor various stage productions.<br />\nThus, we can assume he knows<br />\nwhat he's doing. He does. With<br />\na percussionist's sense of rhythm,<br />\nand a full-fledged composer's<br />\nmusical ability, Van Teighem<br />\ncreates an interesting and surprising aural world for the listener to<br /><br />\nexplore. Van Teighem, like 'dance) productions. Thus, we're<br />\nO'Hearn, is big on synthesizers cut off from that other dimension<br />\nand samplers-the production which should logically accomcredits list virtually every syn- pany the piece\u2014the visual.<br />\nthesizer I've ever hear of, and Though they are interesting, they<br />\nthen some. Unlike O'Hearn, lack the impact they must have<br />\nhowever, Van Teighem uses his originally had, and they are punsounds as more than sounds\u2014 tuating breaks in the albums unithey become the orchestral in- ty.

Nor had<br />\nmy father, who lived through the<br />\nWar in a labor camp in Rumania.<br />\nWhy was Sobibor such a wellkept secret? As the story was<br />\ntold, Sobibor was a death camp<br />\nwhere trainloads of Jews were<br />\nsent to the gas chambers (\"the<br />\nshowers\") every day. The only<br />\nones who escaped immediate<br />\ndeath were the skilled Jews\u2014<br />\nseamstresses, tailors, goldsmiths,<br />\nshoemakers, etc. These Jews<br />\nwere forced to work for the<br />\nNazis, but were allowed to gather<br />\ntogether at night. A group of<br />\nthese Jews masterminded the plan<br />\nof escape.<br />\nAfter witnessing the execution<br />\nof 26 of their brethren as penalty<br />\nfor the escape of two, they for-<br /><br />\nmulated a plan that would include<br />\neach of the 600 prisoners in the<br />\ncamp. The goldsmiths managed<br />\nto make knives and the treecutters<br />\nstole axes; and one by one, the<br />\nkey SS officers were eliminated.<br />\nThis left only the Ukrainian<br />\nguards, the \"brawn without<br />\nbrains\" as the Jews called them.<br />\nIn that situation, the guards were<br />\nconfused, and the prisoners ran<br />\nout the front gates. Many of them<br />\nwere shot, but over 300 made it<br />\nto safety.<br />\nThis inspirational story of<br />\ncourage and determination should<br />\nnot be a secret, but should be told<br />\nagain and again. It belies the image so many have that all Jews<br />\nwalked to their death like sheep<br />\nin the Holocaust. It shows that the<br />\nuniting of minds and souls can<br />\nbring success and dent if not<br />\ndestroy tyranny such as that of the<br />\nNazis.

The<br />\nteam tleaders are midfielder and<br />\nsenior captain Bob Wehman and<br />\ngoalie Joe Donnelly, who<br />\nfrustrated the Jays in Annapolis<br />\nlast season.<br />\nTo win, the Jays must avoid a<br />\nletdown after last week's disappointment. They were sky high<br />\nagainst Maryland, and nearly<br />\npulled off a major upset. This<br />\nweek, they'll have to maintain<br />\nsome of that intensity, because<br />\nNavy is too good to beat with a<br />\nsubpar effort. It's the Middies'<br />\nlast game, and their most important one at that. A win at Hopkins<br />\nlocks up at least the fourth seed,<br />\nwhich means a first-round bye<br />\nand then home field advantage.<br />\nOne way to analyze tomorrow's game is to look at the common opponents the two schools<br />\nhave faced, of which there are<br />\nsix. Both teams snuck by Army<br />\nand Rutgers. Hopkins routed<br />\nWashington College and<br />\nPrinceton and kept Maryland<br />\nclose, while Navy had a little<br />\ntrouble with Washington and<br />\nPrinceton, and lost big to the<br />\nTerps.
