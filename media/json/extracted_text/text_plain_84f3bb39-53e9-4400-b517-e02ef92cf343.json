All<br />\nstudents chose as interns will<br />\ncomplete a training session on<br />\nstandard interview practices<br />\nand basic admissions information. Interns will be expected to<br />\nconduct two to four interviews<br />\neach throughout the fall<br />\nsemester.<br />\nWhile favoring increased student input, Sophomore Class<br />\nRepresentative Jenny Stahl said<br />\nthat undergraduate interviewers<br />\nmight be inappropriate. \"If I<br />\nwere a pre-frosh and I were interviewed by another student, 1<br />\nwould feel gypped [by not<br />\nspeaking to someone who is<br />\ndirectly involved in the selection<br />\nprocessr she said.<br />\nSchnydman defended the<br />\nfeasibility of the intern program, explaining that it would<br />\npermit interviews for 50 more<br />\nstudents each week. \"We normally give about 1400 on campus interviews and still cannot<br />\naccomodate over a thousand<br />\nother applicants who request an<br />\ninterview.\"<br />\nStudent interviews would<br />\nalso supplement off-campus<br />\nalumni interview sessions. Additionally, applicants would be<br />\ntold in advance that their interview may be given by a student<br />\nrather than an admissions<br />\nofficer.<br />\nClaiming that \"The interview<br />\nactually has a very small part in<br />\nthe final decision,\" Schnydman<br />\nconcluded that the intern program would ease some of the<br />\nburden on admissions personnel without being a disadvantage to the applicant. \"Our<br />\nstudents do a better job than<br />\nanyone, including some of the<br />\npaid professionals in my office,\" Schnydman added.<br />\nThe interns will be available<br />\nto approximately 12 to 15<br />\nstudents and will be paid positions, although Schnydman<br />\nwould examine the possibility<br />\nof having participants earn<br />\ncredits instead, if the preferred. \"The intern must be<br />\ndisciplined enough to show up<br />\nfor interviews and be on time,\"<br />\nexplained Schnydman. \"I think<br />\na little more responsibility is expected when you're being paid<br />\nrather that volunteering.\"<br />\nEligibility for the intern positions is restricted to seniors<br />\nsince as interviewers, these<br />\n<br />\nstudents would have access to<br />\npersonal information of applicants, such as transcripts and<br />\nSAT scores.

On the subject of<br />\nchanging class profiles, Schnydman commented that this year's<br />\ngoal is for a class size of 670,<br />\nincluding about 190 engineers.<br />\nThis represents an attempt to<br />\nmaintain increased enrollment,<br />\nas last year's class goal was only 640.<br />\nGreater diversity in the student population is one major<br />\ngoal of the Admissions Office,<br />\naccording to Schnydman.<br />\n\"We are looking for a more<br />\nrealistic representation of<br />\nwomen on campus,\" Schnydman added, \"and we are emphasizing the strength of our<br />\nhumanities and social sciences<br />\nto prospective freshmen. This<br />\nyear we will maintain the<br />\nnumber of pre-meds accepted,<br />\nbut since we are trying to increase class size the percentage<br />\nof pre-meds should go down.\"<br />\nStahl added that the introduction of a general liberal<br />\narts major at Hopkins would be<br />\nbeneficial and might serve to attract more students with interests outside the natural<br />\nsciences. While admitting that<br />\nsuch an issue was outside his<br />\njurisdiction, Schnydman endorsed such a move, saying \"I<br />\nabsolutely agree with it 100<br />\npercent.\"<br />\nIncreased enrollment of<br />\nstudents from the South and<br />\nFar West accounts for greater<br />\ngeographic diversity, and<br />\nSchnydman expressed hope<br />\nthat this trend would continue.<br />\n\"Over the past five years, we<br />\nhave significantly changed the<br />\ndemographic and geographic<br />\nmake-up of the school,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nOf great concern of Schnydman is the dwindling number of<br />\n(non-Asian) minority students<br />\nwho matriculate. \"I'm very<br />\ndisappointed,\" he admitted.<br />\n\"The problem with attracting<br />\nminority students to Hopkins is<br />\nthat all selective schools are vying tor the same group of people.

Cantor acted the role of a priest and<br />\nSchrader became \"David<br />\nDavidus, idol maker.\" On the<br />\ngrounds that many gods are<br />\nbetter than one, they supported<br />\na continuation of the pagan<br />\nculture. This was conducted<br />\nbefore a crowd of approximately 50, which voted down<br />\npaganism. According to<br />\n<br />\nSchrader, \"The. southerners<br />\nwere a little too religious to be<br />\nobjective and failed to appreciate the humor.\"<br />\nThe decision for the tournament was based on two judges<br />\nand the audience vote, with the<br />\naudience counting as a third<br />\njudge. I3oth of the judges sided with Cantor and Schrader.<br />\nThey ended winning the tournament and placing fifth and second in the individual rankings,<br />\nrespectively. Hall and Nozick<br />\nbrought home a second place<br />\ntrophy and Swanson and<br />\nJackson earned fourth place.<br />\nHopkins also took the second<br />\nplace \"sweepstakes\" award in<br />\nthe competition between<br />\nschools. Nozick said, \"We<br />\nbrought<br />\nback<br />\nlots of<br />\nhardware.\"<br />\nEach school which participates in parliamentary<br />\ndebate is allowed one team in<br />\nthe national tournament, plus<br />\nany team which has placed first<br />\nor second in the regular season.<br />\nThus, Cantor, Schrader, Hall<br />\nand Nozick will attend the national tournament at Smith<br />\nCollege in April.<br />\nScott Kamber and Debbie<br />\nKravitz debated at Concordia<br />\nUniversity in Montreal,<br />\nCanada, where they found that<br />\nthe Canadian tournament rules<br />\nprohibited the traditional<br />\nAmerican speaking arrangement. Instead of allowing the<br />\nleader of the opposition team<br />\ntwo speeches, he is expected to<br />\ndeliver a single, long speech.<br />\nAccording to Kravitz, the<br />\nCanadian approach to debate<br />\nalso favored general proposals,<br />\nsuch as \"Communism is a bad<br />\ninfluence.\" Despite these variations, Kamber and Kravitz beat<br />\ntop Canadian teams from<br />\nMcGill University, the University of Toronto and Queen's<br />\nCollege. Kravitz said the change<br />\nin format actually helped, adding a \"new tactic.\"<br />\nKamber and Kravitz argued<br />\n<br />\nhomosexuals should be allowed<br />\nto marry and zoos should be<br />\nabolished along the way to the<br />\nfinal round against McGill.<br />\nThere they argued cities should<br />\nnot be built on fault lines and<br />\nlost, inspiring controversy over<br />\nwhether or not Montreal is built<br />\natop a volcano. They finished<br />\nsecond and took sixth and tenth<br />\nspeaker in individual competition, respectively. In a separate<br />\nspeaking contest, Kamber also<br />\nplaced third. With this showing, they have also qualified for<br />\nnationals.<br />\nAll of the debators credit a<br />\nnew training program for their<br />\nsuccess. Jackson has been<br />\ncoaching first-year debators<br />\nsince the beginning of the year<br />\nand which Bonnie Honig, a<br />\ngraduate student, has instituted<br />\na regimen of weekly practices.<br />\nSchrader praised the system,<br />\nclaiming \"we have just started<br />\nto reap the benefits of the new<br />\nprogram.\"<br />\n\"The coaching has served the<br />\npurpose,\" Kamber said, \"of introducing newcomers to the<br />\nstyle of parliamentary debate,<br />\nbut has not put the necessary polish on experienced teams to enable<br />\nconsistent winning.\"<br />\nTodd Gillman, president of<br />\nthe debate council, said,<br />\n\"Coaching ourselves, we've<br />\nbeen pretty successful, up to a<br />\npoint. We would benefit greatly it' we had a budget for a<br />\ncoach. We have a very<br />\ndedicated team, but there's only<br />\na certain amount we can put in.<br />\nBonnie has been donating her<br />\ntime to us.\"<br />\nJackson is serving on a panel<br />\nwhich will write the official<br />\nAmerican<br />\nParliamentary<br />\nDebate judges training manual.<br />\nNozick looks forward to the<br />\nPrinceton tournament this<br />\nweekend, \"I'm very hopeful.

Pearson, associate professor<br />\nof medicine at the JHU School<br />\nof Medicine. Pearson discussed<br />\ncurrent research concerning the<br />\ncauses of cardiovascular disease<br />\n(CVD), effective preventative<br />\nmeasures, and new programs to<br />\nimplement preventative cardiology.<br />\nPearson began by presenting<br />\na case study. A 27-year-old<br />\nwhite male with no record of<br />\ncardiovascular problems was<br />\nadmitted to Hopkins Hospital<br />\nafter having had a severe heart<br />\nattack.<br />\nThe patient had no record of<br />\nhypertension, did not smoke,<br />\nand did exercise regularly. His<br />\nfamily did, however, have a<br />\nmarked history of heart disease\u2014his parents, among other<br />\nfamily members, having both<br />\nhad heart attacks. In addition,<br />\nthe patient's LDL-cholesterol<br />\nlevel was elevated to a level<br />\ntwice that considered normal.<br />\nPathological study of his<br />\nheart revealed a great deal of<br />\nscarring. The actual attack was<br />\nattributed to the almost total<br />\nobstruction of the coronary<br />\nartery. This obstruction is commonly caused by atherosclerosis, otherwise known as hardening of the arteries.<br />\nThis case serves to illustrate<br />\nthe fact that cardiovascular<br />\ndisease is not just a problem of<br />\nthe elderly. It is, in fact, the<br />\nleading cause of death in<br />\nmiddle-aged men.<br />\nCases such as the one just<br />\ndiscussed led researchers of<br />\ncardiovascular disease to ask<br />\nthe following questions: (1)<br />\nWho is at risk?(2) What factors<br />\ncan be changed to reduce risk?<br />\n(3) Will these changes actually<br />\nreduce the incidence of heart attacks and death due to CVD?<br />\nEpidemiologists studying the<br />\ncauses of CVD list several influential factors that can be<br />\naltered. Among those risk factors are are elevated LDLcholesterol, decreased HDLcholesterol, high blood<br />\npressure, diabetes mellitus,<br />\nsmoking, obesity, sedentary<br />\nlifestyle, use of oral contraceptives, abstinence from alcohol<br />\nconsumption, and having a<br />\nType A personality.<br />\nCardiovascular disease seems<br />\nto have a higher incidence in<br />\nsome families than in others.<br />\nThis is probably due to a combination of hereditary and<br />\nsimilar health behaviors among<br />\nfamily members. Cigarette<br />\n<br />\nsmoking, diet, amount of<br />\nphysical activity, and Type A<br />\npersonality are behaviors that<br />\nare familially influenced.<br />\nHopkins has a Preventive<br />\nCardiology Center that screens<br />\nfamily members of patients<br />\nwith CVD. Participants in the<br />\nprogram exhibit combinations<br />\nof the risk factors previously<br />\nlisted. The center helps these<br />\npeople effectively reduce their<br />\nrisk of CVD.<br />\nPearson cited a study of men<br />\nwith high cholesterol levels.<br />\nHalf of the participants in the<br />\nexperiment were given a drug to<br />\nlower cholesterol levels. The<br />\nother half received a placebo.<br />\nThose given a placebo had a<br />\nhigher CVD rate.<br />\nOf particular interest in recent research is the biochemical<br />\ndisovery of different types of<br />\ncholesterol. LDL-cholesterol<br />\nadds to deposits in arteries,<br />\nwhile HDL-cholesterol seems to<br />\npick up these deposits and<br />\ntransport them to the liver<br />\nwhere they are disposed of, explained Pearson. It is, therefore, advantageous to have a<br />\nhigh ratio of HDL- to LDLcholesterol.<br />\nPearson also commented on<br />\nthe definition of abnormal<br />\nblood cholesterol levels.<br />\nPreviously, those people with<br />\nlevels in the upper five percent<br />\nwere considered at low risk.<br />\nNow the upper quartile is considered to be at moderate risk.<br />\nThis means that one person in<br />\nfour is at risk of developing<br />\nCVD.<br />\nThe aim of preventive cardiology, according to Pearson,<br />\nis to \"sensitize\" health professionals and the public to those<br />\nfactors which cause risk.<br />\nAmong programs soon to be<br />\nimplemented, said Pearson, is<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Lipid Education Program. The program<br />\nis designed to improve physician awareness of serum lipids<br />\n(LDL- and HDL-cholesterol).<br />\nThis is to be accomplished by<br />\nsending educational cassette<br />\ntapes to 50,000 practitioners.<br />\nHopkins will provide screening<br />\n(through the mail) of serum<br />\nlipids of the participating physicians. In addition, each physician will be provided with a<br />\ncalculation of his own risk of<br />\nCVD.<br />\nPearson then continued with<br />\na discussion of other risk factors and ideas to eliminate unnecessary risks.<br />\nSmoking is decreasing among<br />\nmen of all ages. However, it is<br />\non the rise in young women.<br />\nPearson attributed this to<br />\n<br />\nadvertising geared to women.<br />\nHe suggested that perhaps antismoking campaigns should be<br />\ngeared to women as well.<br />\nHe added that there is no<br />\nsafe cigarette. Data from one<br />\nstudy shows that the incidence<br />\nof CVD in nonsmokers is 119<br />\nper 1000 while incidence in<br />\nfiltered-cigarette smokers is 206<br />\nper 1000 and in non-filter<br />\nsmokers is 210 per 1000.<br />\nPassive smoking is also a<br />\nrisk. \"It is probably the main<br />\nrisk factor for initiation or<br />\nresumption of smoking,\" Pearson said.<br />\nThe development of smoking<br />\ncessation programs is currently of interest to preventive<br />\ncardiologists. Several types of<br />\nbehavior modification programs are available. Physicianmediated programs are in the<br />\nmaking.<br />\nOther factors which are easily alterable and quite effective<br />\nin reduction of CVD are the incorporation of moderate<br />\namounts of exercise and the<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\nreduction of saturated fats Thomas A. Pearson, associate professor of medicine<br />\nat JHU who spoke<br />\nwhich are common in the on the subject of cardiovascular disease at this week's Wednesda) Noon<br />\nWestern diet.<br />\nLecture.<br />\nPearson related a study of<br />\nCVD incidence in Eskimos.

A location far<br />\naway from campus could have been<br />\nfound quickly, they always say, but then<br />\nstudents would have complained about<br />\nthat. The fact that so much effort was<br />\ndevoted to finding a location near campus shows how much they care about the<br />\nneeds of the student body. But now it<br />\nseems as if the vicinity of the studios to<br />\nthe campus could be rendered<br />\nworthless\u2014there may not be any way for<br />\nstudents to get there.<br />\nThe logical solution to the transportation problem is to have the East<br />\nBaltimore shuttle stop near WJHU's<br />\nstudios in the 2200 block of Charles<br />\nStreet. The shuttle runs straight down St.<br />\nPaul, and so could drop students off just<br />\na block from the station without going<br />\nout of its way at all.<br />\nTo his credit, W.IHU General<br />\nManager Dave Creagh inquired several<br />\nweeks ago about adding the station to the<br />\nshuttle's list of stops. He says he was told<br />\nby Robert Schuerholz of the Office of<br />\nPlant Planning that another stop probably could not be added since the shuttle is run on a contract basis and there<br />\n<br />\nis no provision in the current contract for<br />\nsuch a stop. Schuerholz says now that<br />\nthat was ,essentially an off-the-cuff<br />\nanswer, and that adding the station as<br />\na shuttle stop is possible, but first he<br />\nneeds a more formal request from<br />\nCreagh and some information on potential demand for the service.<br />\nCreagh should provide all that\u2014at<br />\nleast as far as he is able. As to the demand, though, it would be almost impossible to accurately predict how many<br />\nstudents would use the service. After all,<br />\nthere is yet no station broadcasting from<br />\nthose studios, so there is little reason to<br />\ngo there. Beyond that, the number of<br />\nstudents working at the station would<br />\npresumably increase significantly if there<br />\nwere a way to get there. Lastly, so what<br />\nif the demand is minimal? The shuttle<br />\ndriver simply has to ask if someone<br />\nwants to stop at the station, and, if someone does, pull over to the side of the<br />\nstreet. Surely that doesn't require overwhelming demand.<br />\nClearly the shuttle should stop at<br />\nWJHU. If that creates a lot of work for<br />\nSchuerholz and crew\u2014so be it. If the<br />\nclaim is going to be that the studios'<br />\nnearness to campus benefits students, the<br />\nadministration needs to make sure there<br />\nis some way to get there.<br />\n<br />\nA War Zone?<br />\nHopkins students must be feeling like<br />\nthey're living in a war zone: the library<br />\nseems to get bomb threats every other<br />\nnight, a rape was allegedly committed<br />\nnear campus recently and a student was<br />\nstabbed this week over, of all things, a<br />\nsnowball fight.<br />\nIt seems ridiculous to claim these incidents are related, but, coming all at<br />\nonce, they have reminded us all of the<br />\ndangers of the area, and seem to suggest<br />\nthat some additional security improvements are needed.<br />\nThe last time we remember such a rash<br />\nof security problems was last year. After<br />\nthe most dramatic incident\u2014six students<br />\nwere held up at gun point on the path<br />\nleading from Charles Street to the<br />\ndorms\u2014the administration actually got<br />\noff its duff and did something: the<br />\nbushes along the path were cut down,<br />\nsecurity phones were installed and the<br />\nquad monitor program was created. All<br />\nof that was commendable, but it seems<br />\nsome additional reforms are now in<br />\norder.<br />\nFirst, more security personnel are<br />\nneeded. We aren't blaming those who are<br />\nalready here; considering the urban<br />\nnature of the campus, they seem to do<br />\na pretty good job. But there is only so<br />\nmuch they can do, and clearly more<br />\nneeds to be done. Additional officers<br />\nmight not have prevented the recent<br />\nproblems\u2014they can't patrol off campus<br />\nand its hard to see how they can thwart<br />\nbomb threats\u2014but they surely would improve the general security of the campus.<br />\nNo doubt the principal objection to in-<br />\n<br />\ncreasing the security force will be money.<br />\nBut there really ought not to be any<br />\nhigher priority in the Homewood budget<br />\nthan increasing security.<br />\nBut beyond so fundamental an improvement, campus security can be<br />\ntightened in other ways. How about a<br />\ncall-up system in the dorms, thereby<br />\nremoving the need for people to leave the<br />\ndoors open? (They do so now so that<br />\ntheir friends can enter the buildings.)<br />\nWhy not expand the van service to inchide daylight hours? And as always,<br />\nlighting around the campus could be<br />\nimproved.<br />\nA final improvement doesn't even involve campus security, but could still be<br />\nthe most important move of all. Last<br />\nyear when the hold-up mentioned above<br />\noccurred, Muller said he would soon be<br />\nmeeting with Mayor William Donald<br />\nSchaefer, and planned to bring up the<br />\nissue of increasing city police patrols in<br />\nCharles Village. We don't know if<br />\nanything ever came of the meeting, but<br />\nit certainly couldn't have hurt. Muller<br />\nought to lobby the city again, using his<br />\nconsiderable clout to better police protection for the area surrounding the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nAll of these changes will cost money\u2014<br />\nin some cases a lot of it. But perhaps the<br />\nadministration can take some of the extra $800 it will charge next year to attend<br />\nHopkins, and put it to the best possible<br />\nuse\u2014improving security. Hiking faculty salaries is fine, but a brilliant professor<br />\nwon't do much good if the library is closed because of a bomb threat.<br />\n<br />\nFall, 1979, was a time of<br />\ncelebration here at Hopkins.<br />\nLowly WJHU-AM, with a<br />\nsteadily declining history of 30<br />\nyears of carrier-current broadcast behind it, was finally<br />\nbecoming a real radio<br />\nstations\u2014with a \"booming\"<br />\nsix-mile broadcast radius and a<br />\npotential audience of three<br />\nquarters of a million listeners.<br />\nThere were feature stories in the<br />\nSun, News American, and Ci-<br />\n<br />\nthe station is maddening. What<br />\nis even more maddening is the<br />\nfact that much of the resentment could have been alleviated<br />\nby some common honesty on<br />\nthe part of the administration.<br />\nDespite current claims by certain members of the administration, there was never<br />\nany indication that the power<br />\nincrease would inevitably lead<br />\nIL' pi olcs,1011,11 stittion.

Frankly, few<br />\nof us were naive enough to<br />\nbelieve in the date itself, but we<br />\ndid feel it was a gesture on our<br />\nbehalf.<br />\nWhen last year, a location<br />\nwas \"suddenly\" found for the<br />\n10-watt station, most of us were<br />\nstill excited about radio\u2014a little more cynical about our relain most ol the Lit).

On Feb. 14, as I<br />\nglanced at my source of entertainment for the day, I was horrified by the low level to which<br />\nour amateur journalists have<br />\nsunk. The first letter I read<br />\nnearly made me sick. I refer, of<br />\ncourse, to Jason Hanson's<br />\nmealy-mouthed objection to<br />\nthe News-Letter's headline<br />\n\"Goucher Contemplating Sex<br />\nChange.\" Any self-respecting<br />\nman would be appalled at his<br />\nnamby-pamby attitude.

The high-brow<br />\nattitude Hanson displays takes<br />\npomposity to a new high. I applaud the News-Letter's use of<br />\nwitty, eye-catching headlines to<br />\nentice their readers to read an<br />\narticle. This is merely journalistic common sense. As an<br />\neditor, self-respecting or otherwise, Hanson might have realized<br />\nthis.<br />\nWhile I'm writing this, I<br />\nmight as well touch on another<br />\nsubject. I'm tired, no exhausted, of reading Scott David<br />\nLippe's constant haranguing of<br />\nthe chairmen of this year's<br />\nMSE Symposium and his absolute paranoia regarding the<br />\nstate of Israel. The purpose of<br />\nthe<br />\nsymposium<br />\nis<br />\nto<br />\ndisseminate information about<br />\na chosen topic. To do this, both<br />\nsides of each issue are discussed<br />\nin the hope that intelligent people will then be able to form<br />\ntheir own opinions. Now, if it<br />\noffends Lippe to hear someone<br />\nhold an opinion of Israel that<br />\nis contrary to his own, I have<br />\na suggestion for him: he can<br />\njust not listen. He has already<br />\nproven quite capable of this.<br />\n<br />\nTHEK<br />\nE SO MANY<br />\nMORE IMR,ZrAr.ir NvesTmENT<br />\n<br />\nTo t5E MAGE -PERU,<br />\nAND<br />\nmexsco<br />\n,<br />\nJAMAICA,<br />\nTHAILAMP!<br />\n<br />\nAs someone who supposedly champions legitimate<br />\ncriticism, Lippe had better learn<br />\nthat Israel is not exactly the<br />\nMagic Kingdom. As it is with<br />\nall democracies, Israel has problems that can be discussed in<br />\nthe public forum. This is what<br />\nseparates democracy from<br />\nauthoritarianism. Finally,<br />\nLippe's irrational fear of \"a<br />\nmember of the Jordanian royal<br />\nfamily\" is silly. If Zeid Raad's<br />\nbias is \"distinct,\" I have not yet<br />\ncatalogued Lippe's.<br />\nWhen Lippe responds to this<br />\nletter, as he most likely vill, I<br />\nsuggest that the NewsLetter charge him advertising<br />\nrates to rehash his tired opinions.

It was becoming<br />\nmore and more apparent that<br />\nour original conception of a<br />\npower-increase and the university's were not at all the same<br />\nthing. By this point it was clear,<br />\nin the mind of the administration anyway, that the<br />\n25,000-watt station would be a<br />\nprofessional operation of the<br />\nuniversity and in no way would<br />\nbe a student organization. This<br />\nfact did not sink in until Dave<br />\nCreagh was hired as General<br />\nManager. Nevertheless, we<br />\nwere excited by Creagh for the<br />\nsimple reason that here at last<br />\nwas a person who would give us<br />\nsome honest answers.<br />\nEssentially, we were given no<br />\nmoney, no future, and a<br />\nlocaton that was functionally<br />\ntemporary by definition and<br />\nasked to stay on the air until fall<br />\n1985. We can stick it out that<br />\nlong, we thought. We did. We<br />\ncan stick it out until March 18,<br />\nwe thought. We will. I do not<br />\nthink that we are going to be<br />\naround in June, the date currently proposed for the power<br />\nincrease. The station has been<br />\nforced to function six months<br />\nlonger than it was ever supposed<br />\nto and it shows. The overwhelming bitterness of station<br />\nmembers is slowly turning into<br />\nresignation and acceptance of<br />\nthe situation but few people<br />\nhave the heart to stick with the<br />\nwaiting game for too much<br />\nlonger, nor should they be expected to. It's quite likely that<br />\na specific date will be set for<br />\nshut-down in order to avoid being subject to anymore<br />\nchanges.<br />\nAll of this overshadows the<br />\nfact that WJHU is still an<br />\nawfully good radio station,<br />\nclearly the most progressive in<br />\nBaltimore. It is just hard to put<br />\ntoo much work into the station<br />\nwhen you know your work is<br />\ndoomed to be meaningless in a<br />\nshort bit of time. To a certain<br />\nextent, then, the following proposal is in response to the current lack of future at WJHU.<br />\nThere was a bit of talk<br />\nrecently about a second,<br />\nstudent-run FM station. That<br />\nidea has been scrapped; even if<br />\nthe university were willing to<br />\ngive us the money for such a<br />\nventure, it is very unlikely we<br />\n<br />\nwould be able to find an open<br />\nFM frequency. The talk has<br />\nswung to an AM carrier station,<br />\na system which works in much<br />\nthe same way as close-circuit<br />\nTV, i.e., a building would have<br />\nto be wired for the station for<br />\nits inhabitants pick up the station on their radios. The overwhelming disadvantage of this,<br />\nof course, is the fact that only<br />\nuniversity buildings would be<br />\nable to receive the signal plus<br />\nsome of the apartment<br />\nbuildings across Charles street.<br />\nThe advantage would be that<br />\nthe station would be designed<br />\nto cater to students exclusively,<br />\nand play the sort of music student want to hear.<br />\nCertainly, AM carriercurrent is not as glamorous as<br />\nFM but it is definitely better<br />\nthan nothing. The danger is<br />\nthat people won't take an AM<br />\nstation seriously, neither the<br />\nlisteners nor the station<br />\nmembers themselves. If there is<br />\ngoing to be a student-run radio<br />\nstation, it will have to have<br />\nthe same levels of excellence<br />\nand commitment as the FM station. Otherwise it will be a<br />\nwaste of time and money. The<br />\nstation, as proposed, will serve<br />\nas a training ground for those<br />\nwho want to try out for the FM<br />\nstation and will be an end in<br />\nitself for people interested in<br />\nradio in general.<br />\nIn coming weeks, Paul<br />\nDonio and I, as chairmen of the<br />\nStudent Council's ad-hoc radio<br />\ncommittee, will distribute questionnaires asking for your opinions about the AM -carrier<br />\nproposal\u2014what kind of programming you would like to<br />\nhear, whether you would support such a station, and<br />\nwhether you would like to work<br />\nat such a station. The administration has been supportive of the idea so far but only<br />\nto a certain point. Before the<br />\nAM station gets off the ground,<br />\nthere will have to be proof of<br />\nsufficient student interest. In<br />\nregard to the surveys, an<br />\napathetic response will mean a<br />\nno-vote. It may very well be the<br />\ncase that there is no student interest in an AM station; if that<br />\nis the case, there will be no<br />\nradio station.

Despite what<br />\nso many critics have been saying, 1985 was not a bad year for<br />\nrock music\u2014you just had to<br />\nlook in the right places. Obviously that was not commercial radio\u2014that a band so full<br />\n'of fluffy mediocrity as Mr.<br />\nMister should have a number<br />\none album is proof positive of<br />\nthat fact. The most interesting<br />\nplaces were the guitar-oriented<br />\nBritish bands, including the Fall<br />\nand the Woodentops, and to a<br />\ngreater extent, the \"roots\" based independent labels in the US<br />\nsuch as Homestead, Enigma,<br />\nand Throbbing Lobster.<br />\n\"Roots,\" in the case of most of<br />\nthe bands on these labels is probably not an adequate desciption, though; you could call<br />\nR.E.M.. for example, a<br />\n\"roots\" band but what does<br />\nthat mean? That they play<br />\nlargely undistorted guitars?<br />\nThat they use appealing<br />\nmelodies? That they occasionally use country stylings?<br />\nOnly the least creative bands on<br />\nthese labels should be called<br />\n\"roots\" bands\u2014those that actively imitate country & western<br />\nor folk without adding<br />\nanything to the form.<br />\nWhat to do about the really<br />\noriginal bands then, like the<br />\nVolcano Suns, Doctor's Mob,<br />\nPsycho Daisies, Scream, Squirrel Bait, and of course, Husker<br />\nDu and the Replacements,<br />\nwhich have brought vitality<br />\nback to rock and roll along with<br />\nsome of the musical forms that<br />\nhave proved popular in the<br />\npast? I would suggest the<br />\nsomewhat non -descriptive<br />\n\"post-hardcore,\" in much the'<br />\nsame way that \"post-punk\"<br />\n<br />\nhas been used to descibe those a driving throb that has obvious<br />\nbands in the early 1980's which punk/hardcore roots: there's a<br />\nevolved out of punk.

Singer/guitarist John<br />\nPetkovic sounds a lot like Ian<br />\nCurtis, without perhaps the<br />\noverwhelming edge of desperation, but often with enough<br />\nangst to make him sound like<br />\nthe Joy Division singer reincarnated. On the first side of the<br />\nalbum, the band meanders<br />\nabout at mid -tempo with<br />\nPetkovic's vocals taking<br />\nprecedence; on the second side,<br />\nhowever, the band bursts into<br />\n<br />\nbut are still close enough to<br />\ntheir own origins to maintain<br />\nthe looseness that's been lacking in the Huskers lately.<br />\nSinger/songwriter/guitarist,<br />\nDavid Pirner, has a voice at<br />\nleast as affecting as that of the<br />\nReplacements' Paul Westerburg and during quieter<br />\nmoments, sounds quite a bit<br />\nlike Bruce Cockburn (that's a<br />\ncompliment in these parts) The<br />\nsound of the band never varies<br />\na whole lot, generally being<br />\nnoisy guitar rock with just a<br />\nhint of C&W thrown in.

Doctorow's World's<br />\nFair is a portrait of childhood<br />\nin New York City during the<br />\nDepression. The novel is told<br />\nby the child Edgar, with occasional commentary by his<br />\nmother, older brother and<br />\naunt.<br />\nEdgar grows from three to<br />\neight years old in a series of little scenes. There is no central<br />\nconflict to the plot, but a variety of childhood crises move the<br />\nstory along briskly. There is the<br />\ndemise of the family dog, a<br />\nburst appendix and antiSemitism to contend with. The<br />\ndetails sketch out an authentic<br />\nchildhood, complete with a<br />\ndebate over whether the Green<br />\nHornet is a relative of the Lone<br />\nRanger. Portions of the era are<br />\nrecreated and the entire setting<br />\nhas the unique perspective of a<br />\nchild.<br />\nEdgar's family includes a<br />\nbrother who is eight years<br />\nolder, a senile grandmother,<br />\nand parents who eloped.<br />\nEdgar's father owns a prospering music store.

They break<br />\nup the main flow of the story<br />\nby explaining things to Edgar<br />\nand to the reader. Whatever<br />\npower there is in telling a child's<br />\nstory, it is ruined by these<br />\ndigressions. At best, Edgar's<br />\nmother contributes a little<br />\nbackground information. She<br />\ndelivers speeches about her<br />\nsister-in-law and her mother-inlaw, while also recounting her<br />\nhusband's flaws.

The fair<br />\nis also a representation of<br />\nEdgar's \"private life\" with his<br />\n\"girlfriend\" Meg, and her<br />\nmother. The \"white spire\" and<br />\n\"white globe\" of the fair are<br />\noptimistic symbols for the<br />\nfuture and they form an appropriate backdrop for the<br />\nnovel.

The main<br />\n<br />\nCoffee May Cause Heart Disease<br />\nby Antara Mallampalli<br />\nA new study conducted by<br />\nresearchers at the Hopkins<br />\nMedical School has produced<br />\nstrong evidence suggesting a<br />\npossible association between<br />\ncoffee-drinking and coronary<br />\nheart disease. The study was<br />\ndirected primarily by Dr.<br />\nThomas Pearson of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, and is one<br />\nof the longest-running investigations of the physiological<br />\neffects of coffee, specifically<br />\nwith respect to heart disease.<br />\nThe possibility of a connection between coffee-drinking<br />\nand heart disease has been<br />\nwidely examined in the past as<br />\nwell. According to Dr. Pearson, there have been about<br />\ntwelve different studies conducted over the past 15-20 years<br />\naimed at addressing this problem. For the most part, these<br />\nstudies were largely inconclusive: some of them suggested a relationship between<br />\ncoffee and heart disease while<br />\nthe others simply did not. More<br />\nrecently, however, a number of<br />\nstudies\u2014many of them conNorwegian<br />\nby<br />\nducted<br />\nresearchers\u2014have come up<br />\nwith statistics indicating that in<br />\nrandomized clinical tests coffee<br />\ntaken alone raises serum<br />\ncholesterol levels. It was partly<br />\nresults such as these suggesting<br />\nmuch more strongly that there<br />\nmight be an association between coffee and heart disease<br />\nthat led the Hopkins researchers to pursue their investigation of the problem.<br />\nThe particular set of data used<br />\nin the Hopkins study was as Dr.<br />\nPearson noted, in many ways a<br />\nunique and very valuable one:<br />\nThe study was conducted on all<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool students in the entering<br />\nclasses of 1948-1964. These<br />\n<br />\nstudents were questioned about<br />\ntheir coffee-drinking habits at<br />\nthe time that they registered as<br />\nwell as very five years after<br />\ngraduation, so that the data<br />\navailable to the researchers<br />\ndated back to about 35 years in<br />\nsome cases. These Hopkins<br />\ngraduates were also contacted<br />\nannually to keep track of<br />\nwhether they had expe6enced<br />\nany form of heart disease (in<br />\ncases where the persons had<br />\ndied, death certificates and<br />\nrecords were accordingly examined for cases of cardiovascular problems).<br />\nDr. Pearson and his colleagues were thus able to gather<br />\na large pool of information on<br />\nthis group's exposure to coffee<br />\nover a fairly long period of time<br />\nand on their instances of heart<br />\ndisease, enabling the researchers to address the question of<br />\nwhether there is a correlation<br />\nbetween the two phenomena.<br />\nOn the basis of the dala<br />\ngathered from the records of<br />\nthe former medical school<br />\nstudents, Dr. Pearson and his<br />\nassociates have found that increases in number of cases of<br />\nheart disease correspond strikingly to increasing numbers of<br />\ncups of coffee drunk regularly.<br />\nMore specifically, persons who<br />\ndrank no coffee at all were<br />\nfound to have to lowest rate of<br />\nheart disease in the group; those<br />\nwho drank one or two cups a<br />\nday showed about 1.2 times as<br />\nmany cases of heart disease,<br />\nthose drinking 3 to 4 cups a day<br />\n1.8 times the number of cases,<br />\nwhile those who drank 5 or<br />\nmore cups a day showed as<br />\nmuch as 2.5 to 2.8 times as<br />\nmany cases of heart disease.<br />\nDr. Pearson noted that the<br />\nimportant information in these<br />\nresults is not necessarily the<br />\nprecise numbers of cups of coffee relating to different rates of<br />\n<br />\nheart disease, but rather that Pearson noted that during the<br />\nthe data clearly indicate a con- late 1960's, a. large number of<br />\ntinuous \"dose-response\" cor- physicians in the U.S. gave.up<br />\nrelation between the amount of smoking, so that while as many<br />\ncoffee and the suscpetibility to as 55 percent of them used to<br />\nheart disease.

The first few slides<br />\ndemonstrated that the different<br />\nareas of the brain are sharply<br />\ndefined, and that within these<br />\nareas the tissue is divided<br />\ndistinctly into both layers and<br />\ncolumns. There were several<br />\ngraphs of the results of experiments where different<br />\nchemicals were added to<br />\nsamples of brain tissue, and<br />\nagain the layers were clearly<br />\ndifferentiated.<br />\nMost of Dr. Rakic's experiments were performed on<br />\nunborn fetuses, who were then<br />\n\"sacrificed,\" as he put it, at<br />\ndifferent points in their lives.<br />\nHis first experiments determined that the brain grows<br />\n\"from the bottom up\": the innermost layer is laid down first,<br />\nand the others are added in<br />\norder, one by one. He accomplished this by injecting<br />\ngrowing fetuses at different<br />\nstages of their development<br />\nwith a radioactive tracer that is<br />\nonly absorbed by cells that are<br />\nstill dividing. He also<br />\ndiscovered that each layer is<br />\nproduced on a specific day of<br />\ngestation quite early in the embryo's development, and, after<br />\nthis time, no new brain cells are<br />\ncreated.<br />\nThe next question that Dr.<br />\nRakic addressed was where the<br />\nbrain cells actually come from.<br />\nHe knew that no cells are<br />\ncreated inside the cortex, but<br />\nare somehow carried there from<br />\nthe LGB and attached in the<br />\nright place. During embryonic<br />\ndevelopment, some long thin<br />\nbrain cells called radial glial<br />\ncells form and later disappear<br />\ncompletely. Dr. Rakic theorized<br />\nthat perhaps they serve to guide<br />\nthe other brain cells into place,<br />\nand later, having no other function, dissolve away. His experiments proved that this is indeed what occurs.

For instance,<br />\na significant number of the individuals involved may have<br />\nbeen hypertensive or have had<br />\na history of high cholesterol.<br />\nThe statistics were therefore adjusted to account for the possible influence of other<br />\nfactors\u2014high blood pressure,<br />\nhigh cholesterol, smoking, and<br />\nage\u2014on the rates of heart<br />\ndisease.<br />\nEven after that scaling of the<br />\ndata, Dr. Pearson says, there<br />\nstill emerges a definite, continuous correlation of increasing number of cups of coffee to<br />\n<br />\nincreasing number of cases of<br />\nheart disease. Dr. Pearson cautioned, however, that the study<br />\nstill leaves a number of related<br />\nproblems unsolved.<br />\nFor instance, the effects of<br />\nthe coffee may be influenced by<br />\nthe additives that might be used<br />\n(Dr. Pearson cited the example<br />\nof using cream with coffee<br />\nwhich would on its own contribute to slight increases in<br />\ncholesterol levels). Or perhaps<br />\nthe coffee-drinkers in the examined population had different diets or particular personality traits or reactions to<br />\nstress (after all, these were<br />\nalmost all physicians) that<br />\ncould have also increased their<br />\nchances of experiencing heart<br />\ndisease. Such factors could obviously influence the findings,<br />\nbut at present there are no data<br />\nto determine the extent of their<br />\neffects. Nevertheless, despite<br />\nthese other factOrs, the findings<br />\nof the Hopkins researchers<br />\nrepresent one of the best-<br />\n<br />\ndesigned, and longest running,<br />\nstudies to examine the effects of<br />\ncoffee-drinking with respect to<br />\nheart disease.<br />\nThe immediate conclusion,<br />\nas Dr. Pearson put it, is that<br />\nfurther study into this association is definitely needed,<br />\nespecially in view of the fact<br />\nthat some 80 percent of adult<br />\nAmericans (as well as large<br />\nnumbers of the rest of the<br />\nworld)drink coffee.

I've procrastinated long enough, so<br />\nhere goes.<br />\nFirst of all, the referees<br />\nnot ha \\ lug some kind of national association with a common set of rules, requirements<br />\nand interpretations is archaic.<br />\nThere should be a centralized<br />\nclearing house for officials, incorporated as part of the<br />\nNCAA structure, for all collegiate sports.<br />\nThere would be a number of<br />\nadvantages, I think, if this national association, would do<br />\nsome things that have long been<br />\nneeded.<br />\nFirst, whenever possible, I<br />\nfeel referees should be assigned<br />\nand scheduled as Is most con-<br />\n<br />\nteam played outside the conference, they wouldn't be able<br />\nto use the permanent refs,<br />\nbecause the other guys would<br />\nnaturally think they would<br />\nfavor the ACC.<br />\nAlso, I feel there should be a<br />\nmandatory retirement age set<br />\nfor<br />\nreferees,<br />\nperhaps<br />\nsomewhere between 60 and 65,<br />\nand that each halt' of the new<br />\nofficials entering the collegiate<br />\nranks in all sports should be<br />\nunder 30 years of age. This<br />\nwould maintain a freshness, a<br />\nrotation, and would do away<br />\nwith the bridal-wife sort of<br />\nthing between some conferences and certain officials.<br />\nThat would do away with people saying,\"Oh, no not so and<br />\nso again,\" because you<br />\nwouldn't see the same faces<br />\nevery time you see a game.<br />\nI also think that all new officials should go into a probationary period for two or three<br />\n<br />\nvenient, with an awareness by<br />\nthe national association of their<br />\ntravel requirements and expenses. The ACC is currently<br />\nthinking about going to fulltime referees, which I think<br />\nmakes for an impossible situation, because any time an ACC<br />\n<br />\nyears, and then become permanent. And I think there should<br />\nbe a common salary for all<br />\nDivision I officials in all sports.<br />\nThe way it is now, in basketball, one conference gives a guy<br />\n$150 a game, and another one<br />\ngives him $85 a game, which<br />\nmeans the official naturally<br />\nleans more toward favoring the<br />\nconferences that pay the bigger<br />\nmoney.<br />\nAnother thing, I also think<br />\nthe monies inside the NCAA<br />\nshould be split equally between<br />\nall Division I teams, and that<br />\nit's high time to have the whole<br />\n281 teams participate in the<br />\nNCAA tournament.<br />\nTo do that would require two<br />\nthings: First, you would have to<br />\neliminate the post-season conference tournaments, which<br />\nhave no purpose anymore<br />\nanyhow, because multiple<br />\nteams from each conference get<br />\ninto the NCAA tournament<br />\n<br />\nanyhow. And, you'd have to<br />\nmake the tournament a week<br />\nlonger. Start with 32 sites and<br />\neight teams in the first round at<br />\neach site. That way, two teams<br />\ncould come out of each site,<br />\nwhich puts the number at 64,<br />\nwhich clips into the way it's being done today.<br />\nWhat's happening, the way<br />\nthings are done now, is that<br />\nwe're building dynasties by<br />\noverexposure on TV. In time,<br />\nwe are going to have to limit the<br />\nnumber of appearances on TV<br />\nby any school, because it's<br />\nseparating the strong from the<br />\nweak.<br />\nIt's gotten to the point now<br />\nwhere recruiting is no contest.<br />\nYou have your 40 schools that<br />\nhave achieved star stature with<br />\nthe excessive exposure, who<br />\nusually sign their high school<br />\nplayers before the kid's senior<br />\nContinued on Page 26<br />\n<br />\nENTER THE<br />\n<br />\nHIGH LIFE\u00ae<br />\n<br />\nVVIN AftFINNS<br />\n<br />\nSWEEPSTAKES<br />\nYou could win $10,000 plus a trip for four to<br />\nthe College Basketball Finals!<br />\nGrand Prize:<br />\n$10,000 plus a trip for four to the College Basketball Semi-Finals<br />\nand Finals March 29-31 in Dallas, TX<br />\n5 First Prizes:<br />\n$1,000 plus a Giant Screen TV to catch all the play-off action<br />\n25 Second Prizes:<br />\nVHS Video Recorder/Player<br />\n1,000 Third Prizes:<br />\nOfficial Al McGuire Sports Bag<br />\n<br />\n-----ENTER THE<br />\nOFFIC<br />\nIAL ENTRY FORM<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nW*<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n(PLEASE HAND PRINT)<br />\n<br />\nHIGH LIFE.<br />\n<br />\nI WIN titt FINALS<br />\nSINEEPSTAKES<br />\n<br />\nNAME<br />\nADDRESS<br />\n(No PO Boxes Please)<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nHOW TO ENTER:<br />\nlobe eligible to win a prize you must<br />\ncomplete this entry form and mail to:<br />\nMHL \"Win the Finals\" Sweepstakes<br />\nPO.

All<br />\nstudents chose as interns will<br />\ncomplete a training session on<br />\nstandard interview practices<br />\nand basic admissions information. Interns will be expected to<br />\nconduct two to four interviews<br />\neach throughout the fall<br />\nsemester.<br />\nWhile favoring increased student input, Sophomore Class<br />\nRepresentative Jenny Stahl said<br />\nthat undergraduate interviewers<br />\nmight be inappropriate. \"If I<br />\nwere a pre-frosh and I were interviewed by another student, 1<br />\nwould feel gypped [by not<br />\nspeaking to someone who is<br />\ndirectly involved in the selection<br />\nprocessr she said.<br />\nSchnydman defended the<br />\nfeasibility of the intern program, explaining that it would<br />\npermit interviews for 50 more<br />\nstudents each week. \"We normally give about 1400 on campus interviews and still cannot<br />\naccomodate over a thousand<br />\nother applicants who request an<br />\ninterview.\"<br />\nStudent interviews would<br />\nalso supplement off-campus<br />\nalumni interview sessions. Additionally, applicants would be<br />\ntold in advance that their interview may be given by a student<br />\nrather than an admissions<br />\nofficer.<br />\nClaiming that \"The interview<br />\nactually has a very small part in<br />\nthe final decision,\" Schnydman<br />\nconcluded that the intern program would ease some of the<br />\nburden on admissions personnel without being a disadvantage to the applicant. \"Our<br />\nstudents do a better job than<br />\nanyone, including some of the<br />\npaid professionals in my office,\" Schnydman added.<br />\nThe interns will be available<br />\nto approximately 12 to 15<br />\nstudents and will be paid positions, although Schnydman<br />\nwould examine the possibility<br />\nof having participants earn<br />\ncredits instead, if the preferred. \"The intern must be<br />\ndisciplined enough to show up<br />\nfor interviews and be on time,\"<br />\nexplained Schnydman. \"I think<br />\na little more responsibility is expected when you're being paid<br />\nrather that volunteering.\"<br />\nEligibility for the intern positions is restricted to seniors<br />\nsince as interviewers, these<br /><br />\nstudents would have access to<br />\npersonal information of applicants, such as transcripts and<br />\nSAT scores. For reasons of<br />\nprivacy, only students planning<br />\nto graduate the following spring<br />\nwill be allowed to conduct an<br />\ninterview.<br />\nInterested students who will<br />\ngraduate in May 1987 should<br />\ncontact the Admissions Office<br />\nby March 7.<br />\nSchnydman also answered<br />\nother questions council<br />\nmembers had about the Admissions Office. On the subject of<br />\nchanging class profiles, Schnydman commented that this year's<br />\ngoal is for a class size of 670,<br />\nincluding about 190 engineers.<br />\nThis represents an attempt to<br />\nmaintain increased enrollment,<br />\nas last year's class goal was only 640.<br />\nGreater diversity in the student population is one major<br />\ngoal of the Admissions Office,<br />\naccording to Schnydman.<br />\n\"We are looking for a more<br />\nrealistic representation of<br />\nwomen on campus,\" Schnydman added, \"and we are emphasizing the strength of our<br />\nhumanities and social sciences<br />\nto prospective freshmen. This<br />\nyear we will maintain the<br />\nnumber of pre-meds accepted,<br />\nbut since we are trying to increase class size the percentage<br />\nof pre-meds should go down.\"<br />\nStahl added that the introduction of a general liberal<br />\narts major at Hopkins would be<br />\nbeneficial and might serve to attract more students with interests outside the natural<br />\nsciences. While admitting that<br />\nsuch an issue was outside his<br />\njurisdiction, Schnydman endorsed such a move, saying \"I<br />\nabsolutely agree with it 100<br />\npercent.\"<br />\nIncreased enrollment of<br />\nstudents from the South and<br />\nFar West accounts for greater<br />\ngeographic diversity, and<br />\nSchnydman expressed hope<br />\nthat this trend would continue.<br />\n\"Over the past five years, we<br />\nhave significantly changed the<br />\ndemographic and geographic<br />\nmake-up of the school,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nOf great concern of Schnydman is the dwindling number of<br />\n(non-Asian) minority students<br />\nwho matriculate. \"I'm very<br />\ndisappointed,\" he admitted.<br />\n\"The problem with attracting<br />\nminority students to Hopkins is<br />\nthat all selective schools are vying tor the same group of people. The minority applicants<br />\nwho we accept are usually<br />\ngranted admission by many<br />\nother competitive universities.<br />\nA good many choose to go<br />\neleswhere, despite offers of<br />\n\"financial aid packages for<br />\nminority students at Hopkins<br />\nwhich are very, very good,\"<br />\nadded Schnydman.<br />\nAlso at the meeting:<br />\n'An intense discussion<br />\nerupted during the final 20<br />\nminutes of the council meeting<br />\nafter Student Services Committee co-chairman Dave Shade requested $250 for ten upcoming doughnut breakfasts. The<br />\nneeded funds, which are includ-<br /><br />\ned in the SSC's budget request,<br />\nwould be used to serve students<br />\nfree dougnuts after major exams, a service which the committee introduced last semester<br />\nand has evidently been very<br />\nwell-received.<br />\nOpposition to allocation of<br />\nthe doughnut funds apparently stemmed from concerns over<br />\nthe state of the council budget,<br />\nwhich has been the subject of<br />\nclose scrutiny since representatives learned a few weeks ago<br />\nthat council lacked the money<br />\nto help sponsor this year's<br />\nPublic Interest in Science<br />\nLectures.<br />\nAlthough Treasurer Alan<br />\nRebenstock assured council<br />\nthat the money for the<br />\ndoughnuts \"would not put us<br />\nin the red,\" several members<br />\nfelt that the free breakfasts<br />\nwere not worth the price.<br />\nSenior Class representative<br />\nNgozi Osuagwu was concerned<br />\nthat the breakfasts were not<br />\nfulfilling their initial purpose of<br />\nimproving the council's image<br />\nand relations with the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nRebenstock<br />\nsuggested<br />\nthat the SSC sell the<br />\ndoughnuts at discount rates to<br />\noffset some of the cost, instead<br />\nof simply giving them away.<br />\nSenior Class representative<br />\nAlison Little advocated reducing the number of breakfasts to<br />\nkeep costs down.<br />\nThe matter went to a vote<br />\nwhich resulted in a 9-9<br />\ndeadlock, the only tie vote in<br />\nthis year's council. As required<br />\nby the constitution, the<br />\ndeciding vote was cast by VicePresident Mary Hiatt who was<br />\nfilling in for President Paul<br />\nKadri who was absent for<br />\nhealth reasons. As she realized<br />\nthat the final decision would be<br />\nhers, Hiatt exclaimed, \"Oh<br />\nshit,\" but voted yes to approve<br />\nthe doughnut allocation.<br />\n*Each of the classes approved<br />\n$100 for the sponsorship of the<br />\nPublic Interest in Science Lecture.

This year, the debate<br />\ncouncil competed against teams<br />\nfrom the University of<br />\nMaryland, Baltimore County;<br />\nPrinceton.<br />\nand<br />\nNavy<br />\nRandolph-Macon is the<br />\nsouthernmost tournament, and<br />\nTim Jackson, a vice-president<br />\nof the debate council, believes<br />\n\"Hopkins is the nexus between<br />\nthe north and south in debate.\"<br />\nIn the preliminary competition of six forty-minute<br />\ndebates, Tom Hall and Josh<br />\nNozick as well as Joe Swanson<br />\nand Jackson had a five and one<br />\nrecord. Mike Cantor and Dave<br />\nSchrader finished with a four<br />\nand two record.<br />\nThese three teams advanced<br />\nto the semi-finals, along with a<br />\nUMBC team which had been<br />\nundefeated. Arguing for the<br />\nright of terminally ill patients to<br />\ndie, Hall and Nozick defeated<br />\nSwanson and Jackson. They<br />\nwent on to the final public<br />\nround against Cantor and<br />\nSchrader.<br />\nSetting the debate in the<br />\nRoman Senate, the Government team of Cantor and<br />\nSchrader argued that Christianity should be rejected. Cantor acted the role of a priest and<br />\nSchrader became \"David<br />\nDavidus, idol maker.\" On the<br />\ngrounds that many gods are<br />\nbetter than one, they supported<br />\na continuation of the pagan<br />\nculture. This was conducted<br />\nbefore a crowd of approximately 50, which voted down<br />\npaganism. According to<br /><br />\nSchrader, \"The. southerners<br />\nwere a little too religious to be<br />\nobjective and failed to appreciate the humor.\"<br />\nThe decision for the tournament was based on two judges<br />\nand the audience vote, with the<br />\naudience counting as a third<br />\njudge. I3oth of the judges sided with Cantor and Schrader.<br />\nThey ended winning the tournament and placing fifth and second in the individual rankings,<br />\nrespectively. Hall and Nozick<br />\nbrought home a second place<br />\ntrophy and Swanson and<br />\nJackson earned fourth place.<br />\nHopkins also took the second<br />\nplace \"sweepstakes\" award in<br />\nthe competition between<br />\nschools. Nozick said, \"We<br />\nbrought<br />\nback<br />\nlots of<br />\nhardware.\"<br />\nEach school which participates in parliamentary<br />\ndebate is allowed one team in<br />\nthe national tournament, plus<br />\nany team which has placed first<br />\nor second in the regular season.<br />\nThus, Cantor, Schrader, Hall<br />\nand Nozick will attend the national tournament at Smith<br />\nCollege in April.<br />\nScott Kamber and Debbie<br />\nKravitz debated at Concordia<br />\nUniversity in Montreal,<br />\nCanada, where they found that<br />\nthe Canadian tournament rules<br />\nprohibited the traditional<br />\nAmerican speaking arrangement. Instead of allowing the<br />\nleader of the opposition team<br />\ntwo speeches, he is expected to<br />\ndeliver a single, long speech.<br />\nAccording to Kravitz, the<br />\nCanadian approach to debate<br />\nalso favored general proposals,<br />\nsuch as \"Communism is a bad<br />\ninfluence.\" Despite these variations, Kamber and Kravitz beat<br />\ntop Canadian teams from<br />\nMcGill University, the University of Toronto and Queen's<br />\nCollege. Kravitz said the change<br />\nin format actually helped, adding a \"new tactic.\"<br />\nKamber and Kravitz argued<br /><br />\nhomosexuals should be allowed<br />\nto marry and zoos should be<br />\nabolished along the way to the<br />\nfinal round against McGill.<br />\nThere they argued cities should<br />\nnot be built on fault lines and<br />\nlost, inspiring controversy over<br />\nwhether or not Montreal is built<br />\natop a volcano. They finished<br />\nsecond and took sixth and tenth<br />\nspeaker in individual competition, respectively. In a separate<br />\nspeaking contest, Kamber also<br />\nplaced third. With this showing, they have also qualified for<br />\nnationals.<br />\nAll of the debators credit a<br />\nnew training program for their<br />\nsuccess. Jackson has been<br />\ncoaching first-year debators<br />\nsince the beginning of the year<br />\nand which Bonnie Honig, a<br />\ngraduate student, has instituted<br />\na regimen of weekly practices.<br />\nSchrader praised the system,<br />\nclaiming \"we have just started<br />\nto reap the benefits of the new<br />\nprogram.\"<br />\n\"The coaching has served the<br />\npurpose,\" Kamber said, \"of introducing newcomers to the<br />\nstyle of parliamentary debate,<br />\nbut has not put the necessary polish on experienced teams to enable<br />\nconsistent winning.\"<br />\nTodd Gillman, president of<br />\nthe debate council, said,<br />\n\"Coaching ourselves, we've<br />\nbeen pretty successful, up to a<br />\npoint.

Pearson, associate professor<br />\nof medicine at the JHU School<br />\nof Medicine. Pearson discussed<br />\ncurrent research concerning the<br />\ncauses of cardiovascular disease<br />\n(CVD), effective preventative<br />\nmeasures, and new programs to<br />\nimplement preventative cardiology.<br />\nPearson began by presenting<br />\na case study. A 27-year-old<br />\nwhite male with no record of<br />\ncardiovascular problems was<br />\nadmitted to Hopkins Hospital<br />\nafter having had a severe heart<br />\nattack.<br />\nThe patient had no record of<br />\nhypertension, did not smoke,<br />\nand did exercise regularly. His<br />\nfamily did, however, have a<br />\nmarked history of heart disease\u2014his parents, among other<br />\nfamily members, having both<br />\nhad heart attacks. In addition,<br />\nthe patient's LDL-cholesterol<br />\nlevel was elevated to a level<br />\ntwice that considered normal.<br />\nPathological study of his<br />\nheart revealed a great deal of<br />\nscarring. The actual attack was<br />\nattributed to the almost total<br />\nobstruction of the coronary<br />\nartery. This obstruction is commonly caused by atherosclerosis, otherwise known as hardening of the arteries.<br />\nThis case serves to illustrate<br />\nthe fact that cardiovascular<br />\ndisease is not just a problem of<br />\nthe elderly. It is, in fact, the<br />\nleading cause of death in<br />\nmiddle-aged men.<br />\nCases such as the one just<br />\ndiscussed led researchers of<br />\ncardiovascular disease to ask<br />\nthe following questions: (1)<br />\nWho is at risk?(2) What factors<br />\ncan be changed to reduce risk?<br />\n(3) Will these changes actually<br />\nreduce the incidence of heart attacks and death due to CVD?<br />\nEpidemiologists studying the<br />\ncauses of CVD list several influential factors that can be<br />\naltered. Among those risk factors are are elevated LDLcholesterol, decreased HDLcholesterol, high blood<br />\npressure, diabetes mellitus,<br />\nsmoking, obesity, sedentary<br />\nlifestyle, use of oral contraceptives, abstinence from alcohol<br />\nconsumption, and having a<br />\nType A personality.<br />\nCardiovascular disease seems<br />\nto have a higher incidence in<br />\nsome families than in others.<br />\nThis is probably due to a combination of hereditary and<br />\nsimilar health behaviors among<br />\nfamily members. Cigarette<br /><br />\nsmoking, diet, amount of<br />\nphysical activity, and Type A<br />\npersonality are behaviors that<br />\nare familially influenced.<br />\nHopkins has a Preventive<br />\nCardiology Center that screens<br />\nfamily members of patients<br />\nwith CVD. Participants in the<br />\nprogram exhibit combinations<br />\nof the risk factors previously<br />\nlisted. The center helps these<br />\npeople effectively reduce their<br />\nrisk of CVD.<br />\nPearson cited a study of men<br />\nwith high cholesterol levels.<br />\nHalf of the participants in the<br />\nexperiment were given a drug to<br />\nlower cholesterol levels. The<br />\nother half received a placebo.<br />\nThose given a placebo had a<br />\nhigher CVD rate.<br />\nOf particular interest in recent research is the biochemical<br />\ndisovery of different types of<br />\ncholesterol. LDL-cholesterol<br />\nadds to deposits in arteries,<br />\nwhile HDL-cholesterol seems to<br />\npick up these deposits and<br />\ntransport them to the liver<br />\nwhere they are disposed of, explained Pearson. It is, therefore, advantageous to have a<br />\nhigh ratio of HDL- to LDLcholesterol.<br />\nPearson also commented on<br />\nthe definition of abnormal<br />\nblood cholesterol levels.<br />\nPreviously, those people with<br />\nlevels in the upper five percent<br />\nwere considered at low risk.<br />\nNow the upper quartile is considered to be at moderate risk.<br />\nThis means that one person in<br />\nfour is at risk of developing<br />\nCVD.<br />\nThe aim of preventive cardiology, according to Pearson,<br />\nis to \"sensitize\" health professionals and the public to those<br />\nfactors which cause risk.<br />\nAmong programs soon to be<br />\nimplemented, said Pearson, is<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Lipid Education Program. The program<br />\nis designed to improve physician awareness of serum lipids<br />\n(LDL- and HDL-cholesterol).<br />\nThis is to be accomplished by<br />\nsending educational cassette<br />\ntapes to 50,000 practitioners.<br />\nHopkins will provide screening<br />\n(through the mail) of serum<br />\nlipids of the participating physicians. In addition, each physician will be provided with a<br />\ncalculation of his own risk of<br />\nCVD.<br />\nPearson then continued with<br />\na discussion of other risk factors and ideas to eliminate unnecessary risks.<br />\nSmoking is decreasing among<br />\nmen of all ages. However, it is<br />\non the rise in young women.<br />\nPearson attributed this to<br /><br />\nadvertising geared to women.<br />\nHe suggested that perhaps antismoking campaigns should be<br />\ngeared to women as well.<br />\nHe added that there is no<br />\nsafe cigarette. Data from one<br />\nstudy shows that the incidence<br />\nof CVD in nonsmokers is 119<br />\nper 1000 while incidence in<br />\nfiltered-cigarette smokers is 206<br />\nper 1000 and in non-filter<br />\nsmokers is 210 per 1000.<br />\nPassive smoking is also a<br />\nrisk. \"It is probably the main<br />\nrisk factor for initiation or<br />\nresumption of smoking,\" Pearson said.<br />\nThe development of smoking<br />\ncessation programs is currently of interest to preventive<br />\ncardiologists. Several types of<br />\nbehavior modification programs are available. Physicianmediated programs are in the<br />\nmaking.<br />\nOther factors which are easily alterable and quite effective<br />\nin reduction of CVD are the incorporation of moderate<br />\namounts of exercise and the<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\nreduction of saturated fats Thomas A. Pearson, associate professor of medicine<br />\nat JHU who spoke<br />\nwhich are common in the on the subject of cardiovascular disease at this week's Wednesda) Noon<br />\nWestern diet.<br />\nLecture.<br />\nPearson related a study of<br />\nCVD incidence in Eskimos.

A location far<br />\naway from campus could have been<br />\nfound quickly, they always say, but then<br />\nstudents would have complained about<br />\nthat. The fact that so much effort was<br />\ndevoted to finding a location near campus shows how much they care about the<br />\nneeds of the student body. But now it<br />\nseems as if the vicinity of the studios to<br />\nthe campus could be rendered<br />\nworthless\u2014there may not be any way for<br />\nstudents to get there.<br />\nThe logical solution to the transportation problem is to have the East<br />\nBaltimore shuttle stop near WJHU's<br />\nstudios in the 2200 block of Charles<br />\nStreet. The shuttle runs straight down St.<br />\nPaul, and so could drop students off just<br />\na block from the station without going<br />\nout of its way at all.<br />\nTo his credit, W.IHU General<br />\nManager Dave Creagh inquired several<br />\nweeks ago about adding the station to the<br />\nshuttle's list of stops. He says he was told<br />\nby Robert Schuerholz of the Office of<br />\nPlant Planning that another stop probably could not be added since the shuttle is run on a contract basis and there<br /><br />\nis no provision in the current contract for<br />\nsuch a stop. Schuerholz says now that<br />\nthat was ,essentially an off-the-cuff<br />\nanswer, and that adding the station as<br />\na shuttle stop is possible, but first he<br />\nneeds a more formal request from<br />\nCreagh and some information on potential demand for the service.<br />\nCreagh should provide all that\u2014at<br />\nleast as far as he is able. As to the demand, though, it would be almost impossible to accurately predict how many<br />\nstudents would use the service. After all,<br />\nthere is yet no station broadcasting from<br />\nthose studios, so there is little reason to<br />\ngo there. Beyond that, the number of<br />\nstudents working at the station would<br />\npresumably increase significantly if there<br />\nwere a way to get there. Lastly, so what<br />\nif the demand is minimal? The shuttle<br />\ndriver simply has to ask if someone<br />\nwants to stop at the station, and, if someone does, pull over to the side of the<br />\nstreet. Surely that doesn't require overwhelming demand.<br />\nClearly the shuttle should stop at<br />\nWJHU. If that creates a lot of work for<br />\nSchuerholz and crew\u2014so be it. If the<br />\nclaim is going to be that the studios'<br />\nnearness to campus benefits students, the<br />\nadministration needs to make sure there<br />\nis some way to get there.<br /><br />\nA War Zone?<br />\nHopkins students must be feeling like<br />\nthey're living in a war zone: the library<br />\nseems to get bomb threats every other<br />\nnight, a rape was allegedly committed<br />\nnear campus recently and a student was<br />\nstabbed this week over, of all things, a<br />\nsnowball fight.<br />\nIt seems ridiculous to claim these incidents are related, but, coming all at<br />\nonce, they have reminded us all of the<br />\ndangers of the area, and seem to suggest<br />\nthat some additional security improvements are needed.<br />\nThe last time we remember such a rash<br />\nof security problems was last year. After<br />\nthe most dramatic incident\u2014six students<br />\nwere held up at gun point on the path<br />\nleading from Charles Street to the<br />\ndorms\u2014the administration actually got<br />\noff its duff and did something: the<br />\nbushes along the path were cut down,<br />\nsecurity phones were installed and the<br />\nquad monitor program was created. All<br />\nof that was commendable, but it seems<br />\nsome additional reforms are now in<br />\norder.<br />\nFirst, more security personnel are<br />\nneeded. We aren't blaming those who are<br />\nalready here; considering the urban<br />\nnature of the campus, they seem to do<br />\na pretty good job. But there is only so<br />\nmuch they can do, and clearly more<br />\nneeds to be done. Additional officers<br />\nmight not have prevented the recent<br />\nproblems\u2014they can't patrol off campus<br />\nand its hard to see how they can thwart<br />\nbomb threats\u2014but they surely would improve the general security of the campus.<br />\nNo doubt the principal objection to in-<br /><br />\ncreasing the security force will be money.<br />\nBut there really ought not to be any<br />\nhigher priority in the Homewood budget<br />\nthan increasing security.<br />\nBut beyond so fundamental an improvement, campus security can be<br />\ntightened in other ways. How about a<br />\ncall-up system in the dorms, thereby<br />\nremoving the need for people to leave the<br />\ndoors open? (They do so now so that<br />\ntheir friends can enter the buildings.)<br />\nWhy not expand the van service to inchide daylight hours? And as always,<br />\nlighting around the campus could be<br />\nimproved.<br />\nA final improvement doesn't even involve campus security, but could still be<br />\nthe most important move of all. Last<br />\nyear when the hold-up mentioned above<br />\noccurred, Muller said he would soon be<br />\nmeeting with Mayor William Donald<br />\nSchaefer, and planned to bring up the<br />\nissue of increasing city police patrols in<br />\nCharles Village. We don't know if<br />\nanything ever came of the meeting, but<br />\nit certainly couldn't have hurt. Muller<br />\nought to lobby the city again, using his<br />\nconsiderable clout to better police protection for the area surrounding the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nAll of these changes will cost money\u2014<br />\nin some cases a lot of it. But perhaps the<br />\nadministration can take some of the extra $800 it will charge next year to attend<br />\nHopkins, and put it to the best possible<br />\nuse\u2014improving security. Hiking faculty salaries is fine, but a brilliant professor<br />\nwon't do much good if the library is closed because of a bomb threat.<br /><br />\nFall, 1979, was a time of<br />\ncelebration here at Hopkins.<br />\nLowly WJHU-AM, with a<br />\nsteadily declining history of 30<br />\nyears of carrier-current broadcast behind it, was finally<br />\nbecoming a real radio<br />\nstations\u2014with a \"booming\"<br />\nsix-mile broadcast radius and a<br />\npotential audience of three<br />\nquarters of a million listeners.<br />\nThere were feature stories in the<br />\nSun, News American, and Ci-<br /><br />\nthe station is maddening. What<br />\nis even more maddening is the<br />\nfact that much of the resentment could have been alleviated<br />\nby some common honesty on<br />\nthe part of the administration.<br />\nDespite current claims by certain members of the administration, there was never<br />\nany indication that the power<br />\nincrease would inevitably lead<br />\nIL' pi olcs,1011,11 stittion.

To do this, both<br />\nsides of each issue are discussed<br />\nin the hope that intelligent people will then be able to form<br />\ntheir own opinions. Now, if it<br />\noffends Lippe to hear someone<br />\nhold an opinion of Israel that<br />\nis contrary to his own, I have<br />\na suggestion for him: he can<br />\njust not listen.

That<br />\nidea has been scrapped; even if<br />\nthe university were willing to<br />\ngive us the money for such a<br />\nventure, it is very unlikely we<br /><br />\nwould be able to find an open<br />\nFM frequency. The talk has<br />\nswung to an AM carrier station,<br />\na system which works in much<br />\nthe same way as close-circuit<br />\nTV, i.e., a building would have<br />\nto be wired for the station for<br />\nits inhabitants pick up the station on their radios. The overwhelming disadvantage of this,<br />\nof course, is the fact that only<br />\nuniversity buildings would be<br />\nable to receive the signal plus<br />\nsome of the apartment<br />\nbuildings across Charles street.<br />\nThe advantage would be that<br />\nthe station would be designed<br />\nto cater to students exclusively,<br />\nand play the sort of music student want to hear.<br />\nCertainly, AM carriercurrent is not as glamorous as<br />\nFM but it is definitely better<br />\nthan nothing. The danger is<br />\nthat people won't take an AM<br />\nstation seriously, neither the<br />\nlisteners nor the station<br />\nmembers themselves. If there is<br />\ngoing to be a student-run radio<br />\nstation, it will have to have<br />\nthe same levels of excellence<br />\nand commitment as the FM station. Otherwise it will be a<br />\nwaste of time and money. The<br />\nstation, as proposed, will serve<br />\nas a training ground for those<br />\nwho want to try out for the FM<br />\nstation and will be an end in<br />\nitself for people interested in<br />\nradio in general.<br />\nIn coming weeks, Paul<br />\nDonio and I, as chairmen of the<br />\nStudent Council's ad-hoc radio<br />\ncommittee, will distribute questionnaires asking for your opinions about the AM -carrier<br />\nproposal\u2014what kind of programming you would like to<br />\nhear, whether you would support such a station, and<br />\nwhether you would like to work<br />\nat such a station. The administration has been supportive of the idea so far but only<br />\nto a certain point. Before the<br />\nAM station gets off the ground,<br />\nthere will have to be proof of<br />\nsufficient student interest. In<br />\nregard to the surveys, an<br />\napathetic response will mean a<br />\nno-vote. It may very well be the<br />\ncase that there is no student interest in an AM station; if that<br />\nis the case, there will be no<br />\nradio station. Nevertheless,<br />\nHopkins has too strong a tradition of student radio to let it die<br />\nwithout a second thought.<br /><br />\nreferendum willing to draw a<br />\ndistinction between the issue of<br />\ndivestiture and apartheid, or<br />\nwill they perpetuate the<br />\nstereotype that anyone who is<br />\nopposed to divestment in South<br />\nAfrica is also in favor of the<br />\nracist and unjust system of<br />\napartheid?<br />\nWould those who sponsored<br />\nthe referendum be willing to<br />\nengage in a campus-wide<br />\ndebate, under the aegis of a<br />\nneutral sponsor, so the issues<br />\nsurrounding this controversy<br />\nwill have a full and honest<br />\nairing?<br />\nThese are three basic ways to<br />\napproach political change.

Sue's been doing a<br />\ngreat job and is rising up in the<br />\nworld with semi-regular City<br />\nPaper stints and a teeny-tiny<br />\nmention in the Pazz-Jop section<br />\nof the most recent Village<br />\nVoice, but everyone needs a<br />\nbreak now and then.<br />\nFirst, a few general cornmews about 1985. Despite what<br />\nso many critics have been saying, 1985 was not a bad year for<br />\nrock music\u2014you just had to<br />\nlook in the right places. Obviously that was not commercial radio\u2014that a band so full<br />\n'of fluffy mediocrity as Mr.<br />\nMister should have a number<br />\none album is proof positive of<br />\nthat fact. The most interesting<br />\nplaces were the guitar-oriented<br />\nBritish bands, including the Fall<br />\nand the Woodentops, and to a<br />\ngreater extent, the \"roots\" based independent labels in the US<br />\nsuch as Homestead, Enigma,<br />\nand Throbbing Lobster.<br />\n\"Roots,\" in the case of most of<br />\nthe bands on these labels is probably not an adequate desciption, though; you could call<br />\nR.E.M.. for example, a<br />\n\"roots\" band but what does<br />\nthat mean? That they play<br />\nlargely undistorted guitars?<br />\nThat they use appealing<br />\nmelodies? That they occasionally use country stylings?<br />\nOnly the least creative bands on<br />\nthese labels should be called<br />\n\"roots\" bands\u2014those that actively imitate country &amp; western<br />\nor folk without adding<br />\nanything to the form.<br />\nWhat to do about the really<br />\noriginal bands then, like the<br />\nVolcano Suns, Doctor's Mob,<br />\nPsycho Daisies, Scream, Squirrel Bait, and of course, Husker<br />\nDu and the Replacements,<br />\nwhich have brought vitality<br />\nback to rock and roll along with<br />\nsome of the musical forms that<br />\nhave proved popular in the<br />\npast? I would suggest the<br />\nsomewhat non -descriptive<br />\n\"post-hardcore,\" in much the'<br />\nsame way that \"post-punk\"<br /><br />\nhas been used to descibe those a driving throb that has obvious<br />\nbands in the early 1980's which punk/hardcore roots: there's a<br />\nevolved out of punk. In the case moment on \"Grapeland (I'm<br />\nof post-punk, like Joy Division Getting Sick)\" when Petkovic<br />\nand the Gang of Four. In the sings \"And I wanna \" and<br />\ncase of post-hardcore, however, you can't help thinking that<br />\nthe development has meant an he's going to complete it with<br />\nabsolute distaste for the synth \"be Anarchy.\" The band<br />\nand what I guess can be called sound like hardcore in the proa return to basics, if what is cess of growing up; Death of<br />\nbasic is energy, lack of com- Samantha is \"rootish\" in only<br />\npromise and just plain old rock the most basic sense\u2014explosive<br />\n&amp; roll (please be aware that I and original.

Singer/guitarist John<br />\nPetkovic sounds a lot like Ian<br />\nCurtis, without perhaps the<br />\noverwhelming edge of desperation, but often with enough<br />\nangst to make him sound like<br />\nthe Joy Division singer reincarnated. On the first side of the<br />\nalbum, the band meanders<br />\nabout at mid -tempo with<br />\nPetkovic's vocals taking<br />\nprecedence; on the second side,<br />\nhowever, the band bursts into<br /><br />\nbut are still close enough to<br />\ntheir own origins to maintain<br />\nthe looseness that's been lacking in the Huskers lately.<br />\nSinger/songwriter/guitarist,<br />\nDavid Pirner, has a voice at<br />\nleast as affecting as that of the<br />\nReplacements' Paul Westerburg and during quieter<br />\nmoments, sounds quite a bit<br />\nlike Bruce Cockburn (that's a<br />\ncompliment in these parts) The<br />\nsound of the band never varies<br />\na whole lot, generally being<br />\nnoisy guitar rock with just a<br />\nhint of C&amp;W thrown in. There<br />\nis even the token acoustic song,<br />\n\"Never Really Been,\" the<br />\nwillful banality of which is actually a clear slap in the face of<br />\nnormal \"heart-felt\" ballads.<br />\nNevertheless, Soul Asylum is<br />\ngreatest in its chaotic attack\u2014<br />\nthere's rarely a moment of<br />\nplanning apparent anywhere<br />\nwith the guitars going all over<br />\nthe place and the harmonies<br />\nhappening out of nowhere;<br />\nwhen things actually start to<br />\ngroove, as on \"Don't It,\"<br />\nthere's an incredible release of<br />\nenergy.

If it is rooted in<br />\nanything, it is folk and/or jazzfunk\u2014certainly nothing approaching thrash. Boon, in particular, chooses the folk-protest<br />\nroute although with George<br />\nHurley deftly pounding away<br />\non the drums and Mike Watt<br />\nslapping away on the bass it remains just far enough away<br />\nfrom anything you've ever<br />\nheard before to keep it<br />\nchallenging. Mike Watt's<br />\nsongs, on the other hand, veer<br />\noff into the avant-garde but<br />\nironically, the lyrics (written by<br />\nKira of Black Flag)are the most<br />\naccessible words ever to be attached to any of his songs.<br />\nIn fact, the lyrics on this<br />\nalbum are the record's biggest<br />\nproblem.

Doctorow's World's<br />\nFair is a portrait of childhood<br />\nin New York City during the<br />\nDepression. The novel is told<br />\nby the child Edgar, with occasional commentary by his<br />\nmother, older brother and<br />\naunt.<br />\nEdgar grows from three to<br />\neight years old in a series of little scenes. There is no central<br />\nconflict to the plot, but a variety of childhood crises move the<br />\nstory along briskly. There is the<br />\ndemise of the family dog, a<br />\nburst appendix and antiSemitism to contend with. The<br />\ndetails sketch out an authentic<br />\nchildhood, complete with a<br />\ndebate over whether the Green<br />\nHornet is a relative of the Lone<br />\nRanger. Portions of the era are<br />\nrecreated and the entire setting<br />\nhas the unique perspective of a<br />\nchild.<br />\nEdgar's family includes a<br />\nbrother who is eight years<br />\nolder, a senile grandmother,<br />\nand parents who eloped.<br />\nEdgar's father owns a prospering music store. In the<br />\nbackground are problems between father and mother, dimly<br /><br />\nperceived and not really<br />\nunderstood. The Depression is<br />\nfelt only occasionally, Edgar's<br />\nfamily being relatively well off.<br />\nEdgar tells his story in a<br />\nsophisticated way.

They break<br />\nup the main flow of the story<br />\nby explaining things to Edgar<br />\nand to the reader. Whatever<br />\npower there is in telling a child's<br />\nstory, it is ruined by these<br />\ndigressions. At best, Edgar's<br />\nmother contributes a little<br />\nbackground information. She<br />\ndelivers speeches about her<br />\nsister-in-law and her mother-inlaw, while also recounting her<br />\nhusband's flaws.

The fair<br />\nis also a representation of<br />\nEdgar's \"private life\" with his<br />\n\"girlfriend\" Meg, and her<br />\nmother. The \"white spire\" and<br />\n\"white globe\" of the fair are<br />\noptimistic symbols for the<br />\nfuture and they form an appropriate backdrop for the<br />\nnovel. World's Fair winds up<br />\nheaded toward the fair, a<br />\nmeaning-packed symbol, which<br />\nhas just enough myth and<br />\nmysticism not to be overdone.<br />\nThe work demonstrates what<br />\ncan still be done with a<br />\nstraightforward story.

The main<br /><br />\nCoffee May Cause Heart Disease<br />\nby Antara Mallampalli<br />\nA new study conducted by<br />\nresearchers at the Hopkins<br />\nMedical School has produced<br />\nstrong evidence suggesting a<br />\npossible association between<br />\ncoffee-drinking and coronary<br />\nheart disease. The study was<br />\ndirected primarily by Dr.<br />\nThomas Pearson of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, and is one<br />\nof the longest-running investigations of the physiological<br />\neffects of coffee, specifically<br />\nwith respect to heart disease.<br />\nThe possibility of a connection between coffee-drinking<br />\nand heart disease has been<br />\nwidely examined in the past as<br />\nwell. According to Dr. Pearson, there have been about<br />\ntwelve different studies conducted over the past 15-20 years<br />\naimed at addressing this problem. For the most part, these<br />\nstudies were largely inconclusive: some of them suggested a relationship between<br />\ncoffee and heart disease while<br />\nthe others simply did not. More<br />\nrecently, however, a number of<br />\nstudies\u2014many of them conNorwegian<br />\nby<br />\nducted<br />\nresearchers\u2014have come up<br />\nwith statistics indicating that in<br />\nrandomized clinical tests coffee<br />\ntaken alone raises serum<br />\ncholesterol levels. It was partly<br />\nresults such as these suggesting<br />\nmuch more strongly that there<br />\nmight be an association between coffee and heart disease<br />\nthat led the Hopkins researchers to pursue their investigation of the problem.<br />\nThe particular set of data used<br />\nin the Hopkins study was as Dr.<br />\nPearson noted, in many ways a<br />\nunique and very valuable one:<br />\nThe study was conducted on all<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool students in the entering<br />\nclasses of 1948-1964. These<br /><br />\nstudents were questioned about<br />\ntheir coffee-drinking habits at<br />\nthe time that they registered as<br />\nwell as very five years after<br />\ngraduation, so that the data<br />\navailable to the researchers<br />\ndated back to about 35 years in<br />\nsome cases. These Hopkins<br />\ngraduates were also contacted<br />\nannually to keep track of<br />\nwhether they had expe6enced<br />\nany form of heart disease (in<br />\ncases where the persons had<br />\ndied, death certificates and<br />\nrecords were accordingly examined for cases of cardiovascular problems).<br />\nDr. Pearson and his colleagues were thus able to gather<br />\na large pool of information on<br />\nthis group's exposure to coffee<br />\nover a fairly long period of time<br />\nand on their instances of heart<br />\ndisease, enabling the researchers to address the question of<br />\nwhether there is a correlation<br />\nbetween the two phenomena.<br />\nOn the basis of the dala<br />\ngathered from the records of<br />\nthe former medical school<br />\nstudents, Dr. Pearson and his<br />\nassociates have found that increases in number of cases of<br />\nheart disease correspond strikingly to increasing numbers of<br />\ncups of coffee drunk regularly.<br />\nMore specifically, persons who<br />\ndrank no coffee at all were<br />\nfound to have to lowest rate of<br />\nheart disease in the group; those<br />\nwho drank one or two cups a<br />\nday showed about 1.2 times as<br />\nmany cases of heart disease,<br />\nthose drinking 3 to 4 cups a day<br />\n1.8 times the number of cases,<br />\nwhile those who drank 5 or<br />\nmore cups a day showed as<br />\nmuch as 2.5 to 2.8 times as<br />\nmany cases of heart disease.<br />\nDr. Pearson noted that the<br />\nimportant information in these<br />\nresults is not necessarily the<br />\nprecise numbers of cups of coffee relating to different rates of<br /><br />\nheart disease, but rather that Pearson noted that during the<br />\nthe data clearly indicate a con- late 1960's, a. large number of<br />\ntinuous \"dose-response\" cor- physicians in the U.S. gave.up<br />\nrelation between the amount of smoking, so that while as many<br />\ncoffee and the suscpetibility to as 55 percent of them used to<br />\nheart disease.

Dr.<br />\nContinued on Page 22<br /><br />\nfocus was on the cortex which<br />\ndirects the actions of the<br />\nvarious parts of the body and<br />\nis the seat of intelligence in<br />\nman. The first few slides<br />\ndemonstrated that the different<br />\nareas of the brain are sharply<br />\ndefined, and that within these<br />\nareas the tissue is divided<br />\ndistinctly into both layers and<br />\ncolumns. There were several<br />\ngraphs of the results of experiments where different<br />\nchemicals were added to<br />\nsamples of brain tissue, and<br />\nagain the layers were clearly<br />\ndifferentiated.<br />\nMost of Dr. Rakic's experiments were performed on<br />\nunborn fetuses, who were then<br />\n\"sacrificed,\" as he put it, at<br />\ndifferent points in their lives.<br />\nHis first experiments determined that the brain grows<br />\n\"from the bottom up\": the innermost layer is laid down first,<br />\nand the others are added in<br />\norder, one by one. He accomplished this by injecting<br />\ngrowing fetuses at different<br />\nstages of their development<br />\nwith a radioactive tracer that is<br />\nonly absorbed by cells that are<br />\nstill dividing. He also<br />\ndiscovered that each layer is<br />\nproduced on a specific day of<br />\ngestation quite early in the embryo's development, and, after<br />\nthis time, no new brain cells are<br />\ncreated.<br />\nThe next question that Dr.<br />\nRakic addressed was where the<br />\nbrain cells actually come from.<br />\nHe knew that no cells are<br />\ncreated inside the cortex, but<br />\nare somehow carried there from<br />\nthe LGB and attached in the<br />\nright place. During embryonic<br />\ndevelopment, some long thin<br />\nbrain cells called radial glial<br />\ncells form and later disappear<br />\ncompletely. Dr. Rakic theorized<br />\nthat perhaps they serve to guide<br />\nthe other brain cells into place,<br />\nand later, having no other function, dissolve away. His experiments proved that this is indeed what occurs.

He decided that either<br />\nthere is some mechanism that<br />\nattracts each cell to a certain<br />\narea, or the different types of<br />\ncells compete for the limited<br />\nvolume available. It had<br />\nalready been discovered that for<br />\nsome reason a fetus forms<br />\nmany more cells than are present at birth.

Dr. Pearson cautioned, however, that the study<br />\nstill leaves a number of related<br />\nproblems unsolved.<br />\nFor instance, the effects of<br />\nthe coffee may be influenced by<br />\nthe additives that might be used<br />\n(Dr. Pearson cited the example<br />\nof using cream with coffee<br />\nwhich would on its own contribute to slight increases in<br />\ncholesterol levels). Or perhaps<br />\nthe coffee-drinkers in the examined population had different diets or particular personality traits or reactions to<br />\nstress (after all, these were<br />\nalmost all physicians) that<br />\ncould have also increased their<br />\nchances of experiencing heart<br />\ndisease. Such factors could obviously influence the findings,<br />\nbut at present there are no data<br />\nto determine the extent of their<br />\neffects. Nevertheless, despite<br />\nthese other factOrs, the findings<br />\nof the Hopkins researchers<br />\nrepresent one of the best-<br /><br />\ndesigned, and longest running,<br />\nstudies to examine the effects of<br />\ncoffee-drinking with respect to<br />\nheart disease.<br />\nThe immediate conclusion,<br />\nas Dr. Pearson put it, is that<br />\nfurther study into this association is definitely needed,<br />\nespecially in view of the fact<br />\nthat some 80 percent of adult<br />\nAmericans (as well as large<br />\nnumbers of the rest of the<br />\nworld)drink coffee.

I've procrastinated long enough, so<br />\nhere goes.<br />\nFirst of all, the referees<br />\nnot ha \\ lug some kind of national association with a common set of rules, requirements<br />\nand interpretations is archaic.<br />\nThere should be a centralized<br />\nclearing house for officials, incorporated as part of the<br />\nNCAA structure, for all collegiate sports.<br />\nThere would be a number of<br />\nadvantages, I think, if this national association, would do<br />\nsome things that have long been<br />\nneeded.<br />\nFirst, whenever possible, I<br />\nfeel referees should be assigned<br />\nand scheduled as Is most con-<br /><br />\nteam played outside the conference, they wouldn't be able<br />\nto use the permanent refs,<br />\nbecause the other guys would<br />\nnaturally think they would<br />\nfavor the ACC.<br />\nAlso, I feel there should be a<br />\nmandatory retirement age set<br />\nfor<br />\nreferees,<br />\nperhaps<br />\nsomewhere between 60 and 65,<br />\nand that each halt' of the new<br />\nofficials entering the collegiate<br />\nranks in all sports should be<br />\nunder 30 years of age. This<br />\nwould maintain a freshness, a<br />\nrotation, and would do away<br />\nwith the bridal-wife sort of<br />\nthing between some conferences and certain officials.<br />\nThat would do away with people saying,\"Oh, no not so and<br />\nso again,\" because you<br />\nwouldn't see the same faces<br />\nevery time you see a game.<br />\nI also think that all new officials should go into a probationary period for two or three<br /><br />\nvenient, with an awareness by<br />\nthe national association of their<br />\ntravel requirements and expenses. The ACC is currently<br />\nthinking about going to fulltime referees, which I think<br />\nmakes for an impossible situation, because any time an ACC<br /><br />\nyears, and then become permanent. And I think there should<br />\nbe a common salary for all<br />\nDivision I officials in all sports.<br />\nThe way it is now, in basketball, one conference gives a guy<br />\n$150 a game, and another one<br />\ngives him $85 a game, which<br />\nmeans the official naturally<br />\nleans more toward favoring the<br />\nconferences that pay the bigger<br />\nmoney.<br />\nAnother thing, I also think<br />\nthe monies inside the NCAA<br />\nshould be split equally between<br />\nall Division I teams, and that<br />\nit's high time to have the whole<br />\n281 teams participate in the<br />\nNCAA tournament.<br />\nTo do that would require two<br />\nthings: First, you would have to<br />\neliminate the post-season conference tournaments, which<br />\nhave no purpose anymore<br />\nanyhow, because multiple<br />\nteams from each conference get<br />\ninto the NCAA tournament<br /><br />\nanyhow. And, you'd have to<br />\nmake the tournament a week<br />\nlonger. Start with 32 sites and<br />\neight teams in the first round at<br />\neach site. That way, two teams<br />\ncould come out of each site,<br />\nwhich puts the number at 64,<br />\nwhich clips into the way it's being done today.<br />\nWhat's happening, the way<br />\nthings are done now, is that<br />\nwe're building dynasties by<br />\noverexposure on TV. In time,<br />\nwe are going to have to limit the<br />\nnumber of appearances on TV<br />\nby any school, because it's<br />\nseparating the strong from the<br />\nweak.<br />\nIt's gotten to the point now<br />\nwhere recruiting is no contest.<br />\nYou have your 40 schools that<br />\nhave achieved star stature with<br />\nthe excessive exposure, who<br />\nusually sign their high school<br />\nplayers before the kid's senior<br />\nContinued on Page 26<br /><br />\nENTER THE<br /><br />\nHIGH LIFE\u00ae<br /><br />\nVVIN AftFINNS<br /><br />\nSWEEPSTAKES<br />\nYou could win $10,000 plus a trip for four to<br />\nthe College Basketball Finals!<br />\nGrand Prize:<br />\n$10,000 plus a trip for four to the College Basketball Semi-Finals<br />\nand Finals March 29-31 in Dallas, TX<br />\n5 First Prizes:<br />\n$1,000 plus a Giant Screen TV to catch all the play-off action<br />\n25 Second Prizes:<br />\nVHS Video Recorder/Player<br />\n1,000 Third Prizes:<br />\nOfficial Al McGuire Sports Bag<br /><br />\n-----ENTER THE<br />\nOFFIC<br />\nIAL ENTRY FORM<br />\nI<br /><br />\nW*<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n(PLEASE HAND PRINT)<br /><br />\nHIGH LIFE.<br /><br />\nI WIN titt FINALS<br />\nSINEEPSTAKES<br /><br />\nNAME<br />\nADDRESS<br />\n(No PO Boxes Please)<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nHOW TO ENTER:<br />\nlobe eligible to win a prize you must<br />\ncomplete this entry form and mail to:<br />\nMHL \"Win the Finals\" Sweepstakes<br />\nPO.
