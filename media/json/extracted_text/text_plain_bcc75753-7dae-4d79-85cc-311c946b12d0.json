World Student<br />\nService Fund. Although it should<br />\nnot be called an activity, ,since, it<br />\ndoes not olicit membership \u2022 to<br />\nperpetuate itself. the WSSF does<br />\noffer the college student a chance<br />\nit doing something in the way of<br />\n\"aiding the other fellow,\" materially and intellectually.<br />\n<br />\npresented daily. Although specialists are in demand, foreign<br />\nrepresentatives must strike a .proper balance between their specialty and a broad cultural training. It seems that SAIS can<br />\nachieve this balance. such .men as Dr. Mose L. Harvey, Russian<br />\naffairs expert, and Dr. Miron Burgin, one of the State Department's leading advisers on Latin American problems, are but two<br />\nin a long line of top-notch men in foreign affairs who teach at<br />\nSAIS.<br />\nFor many years the name \"Johns Hopkins\" has meant hut one<br />\nthing to the general population the world over. That was, of<br />\ncourse, seience, especially medicine. It is indeed an encouraging<br />\nfact to know that through such a unit of Hopkins as SAIS the<br />\nuniversity will grow even stronger in diverse fields of intellectual<br />\nand practical achievement.<br />\nEducational institutions in this country have never stressed<br />\ntraining for the diplomatic service while those in Europe have long<br />\nestablished schools where men and women may be trained to represent their nations abroad. It is only fitting that Johns Hopkins<br />\nshould now take its place with Harvard, Princeton and Yale in the<br />\ntraining of the foreign experts and ambassadors of tomorrow.<br />\n<br />\nThis year the organization finds<br />\nitself under the direction of Al<br />\nBessin, as its chairman. Bessin<br />\noutlines the Fund's tasks as \"a<br />\nway of relieving the international<br />\nsituation ay understanding<br />\nthrough education.\" Because the<br />\nUnited States is one of the few<br />\nnations with facilities for higher<br />\neducation for a greater percentage<br />\n<br />\nAL BESSIN \u2014 president of<br />\nWSSF,readying annual fund drive.<br />\nof the population, the U.
