The principal object of the University in making provision for the<br />\n, session is to furnish instruction to<br />\nteachers in all grades of schools,<br />\nand to other persons who seek opportunities for instruction, with or<br />\nwithout reference to an academic<br />\ndegree. Some courses offered are<br />\ndesigned to meet the needs of matriculated students who wish to advance their standing or to make up<br />\ndeficiencies; others, to enable .nonmatriculated students to absolve in<br />\npart the entrance requirements.<br />\nSo popular was this branch of<br />\nthe University last year .that 201<br />\npersons attended. The courses<br />\nwere not only popular, but so thorough that the Board of Collegiate<br />\n- Studies has made it .possible this<br />\nyear for a student to receive a maximum of one-half credit per course<br />\nins:ead of one-third as heretofore.<br />\nHowever, of the courses given in<br />\none summer session, matriculated<br />\nstudents or candidates for matriculation in the University may offer<br />\nfor credit not more than two<br />\ncourses in collegiate subjects.<br />\nThe tuition fee is $25, payment<br />\nof which entitles the student tb attend as many as three courses.<br />\nThe faculty of the summer school<br />\nconsists of twenty instructors, of<br />\nwhom four are women:<br />\n<br />\nIn view of the success of the<br />\ntennis team at Hopkins last season<br />\nand the interest this year displayed<br />\non all sides, a most ambitious<br />\nschedule has been arranged for the<br />\ncollege team. Numerous challenges<br />\nwere received, even from as far<br />\nwest as the University of Michigan. Some of these offers had to<br />\nbe declined because of the expense<br />\ninvolved, but the schedule, as finally<br />\nmade up, is the best that the team<br />\nhas ever had. In consists of seven<br />\nmatches\u2014three away and four in<br />\nBaltimore. The matches were arranged as much as possible for days<br />\nwhen a baseball game would not<br />\ninterfere with the playing on the<br />\ncourts.<br />\nAs announced by Manager Corner, the dates are:<br />\nSaturday, April I2\u2014Georgetown<br />\nUniversity at Homewood (afternoon).<br />\nSaturday, April 26\u2014Navy at Annapolis (afternoon).<br />\nWednesday, April 30\u2014Catholic<br />\nUniversity at Washington (afternoon).<br />\nFriday, May 2\u2014University of<br />\nPennsylvania at Homewood (afternoon).<br />\nWednesday, May 7\u2014St. John's<br />\nat Annapolis (afternoon).<br />\nSaturday, May 17\u2014Lehigh at<br />\nHomewood( morning).<br />\nThursday, May 22\u2014Haverford<br />\nat Homewood (afternoon).<br />\nHopkins has never played Catholic University, Haverford or Lehigh before. \u2022<br />\nAs the groundkeeper has promised that the dirt courts will be<br />\nthrown open for playing early this<br />\nweek, Captain Hammond will issue<br />\na call for players in the very near<br />\nfuture. The men who played at<br />\nleast once last year are: Belt, Dubray, Bacon, Hammond, Corner,<br />\nSpringer, Angell and Hatch; of<br />\nthese Dubray, Hammond, Corner<br />\nand Bacon are still at the University. It is plain that there is room<br />\nfor several new players. Those<br />\nwho practice steadily will receive<br />\nthe preference at the time of \u2022 the<br />\nchoice of the personnel of the team.<br />\nUndergraduates are to be given<br />\nevery chance. Captain Hammond<br />\nis hoping that some talent will be<br />\ndiscovered in the lower classes.<br />\nAmong the other men who are expected out this year are: Sears,<br />\nLentz, Brady, Harrop, D. Penniman, G. Porter and Huck. Most<br />\nof the matches call for four singles<br />\nand two doubles.<br />\n<br />\nFor the first time in the history of international relations, the<br />\nUnited States will act as host to<br />\nthe young scholars of the world<br />\nthis fall, when the Eighth International Congress of Students will<br />\ntake place under the auspices of the<br />\nAssociation of Cosmopolitan Clubs.<br />\nThe official sessions will take<br />\nplace on September 3-7, at Cornell<br />\nUniversity, where the Cornell Cosmopolitan Club will throw open its<br />\nmagnificent $50,000 clubhouse and<br />\nentertain the foreign guests in right<br />\nroyal fashion. In addition, a comprehensive itinerary has been<br />\nworked out, beginning with the arrival of the delegates at Boston on<br />\nor about August 27, and ending<br />\nwith their departure from New<br />\nYork on September 16, which is<br />\nto comprise such features as a visit<br />\nto the historic spots of Boston<br />\nand Harvard University; a daylight trip on the Hudson from New<br />\nYork to Albany; a reception at the<br />\ncapitol of the Empire, State by<br />\nGovernor Sulzer; an excursion to<br />\n\"God's Grand Organ,\" the Niagara Falls; an inspection of<br />\nthe university, the United States<br />\nMint and the Curtis publishing<br />\nplant at Philadelphia; a \u2022 stay of<br />\nseveral days at Washington, with a<br />\nbrillian reception in the Hall of the<br />\nAmericas at the \u2022 Pan-American<br />\nUnion, and a less formal reception<br />\nby President Wilson, and a final reunion at New York, with a banquet by the New York Peace Society.<br />\nThe object of the congress, as<br />\nset forth in the \"call\" recently issued, is \"to bring together the representatives from all the students<br />\nof the world, in order that the<br />\nspirit of international brotherhood<br />\nand humanity may be fostered<br />\namong them as a result of the deliberations of the congress, and in<br />\norder that the students of the<br />\nworld may be united into an allembracing world organization.\"<br />\nThe congress committee has received considerable material support from the -Division for Intercourse and Education of the Carnegie Foundation, which granted<br />\na subvention of $2,500 to finance<br />\nthe undertaking, and from the<br />\nWorld Peace Foundation of Boston. An\\,. organization that has<br />\nfor its aim the promotion of friendship and mutual understanding of<br />\nstudents from different countries is<br />\ncordially invited to send delegates.<br />\nWe hope that Hopkins will send<br />\na delegation.<br />\n<br />\nThe baseball team had but slight<br />\ndifficulty with the Washington College nine on Saturday, and defeated<br />\nthem by the score of i i to 6. Although there were many errors and<br />\na great deal of ragged fielding, yet<br />\nthe team as a whore showed marked<br />\nimprovement over, the form displayed against Pennsylvania last<br />\nTuesday. This was particularly<br />\nnoticeable at the bat. Coach Hooper<br />\nhas been giving the squad rather<br />\nstrenuous batting practices and the<br />\nresult was appreciably heavier hitting..<br />\nHopkins gathered in three runs<br />\nin the fifth inning when Sutton<br />\nstarted off with a home-run. Williams was passed. Hobbs and Wilson both singled, and Williams and<br />\nHobbs scored. Wilson, however,<br />\nwas caught off third base and Hallock fanned, ending the inning.<br />\nThree of *Washington College's<br />\nruns came in the seventh. Frampton got to first on Hobbs' error, and<br />\nafter Pearson had flied out to Webster, Lewis rapped out a two-bagger. Then an error by Hallock and<br />\ntwo more Washington College hits<br />\ncontributed three. runs. But Hopkins came back in their half of the<br />\nseventh, and by means of singles by<br />\nBagley, Rice and Sutton, and a<br />\nhome-run by Hobbs, scored four<br />\nruns.<br />\nThe only mishap of the game occurred in the second inning. Wallace, a Washington man, attempted<br />\nto score from third on an overthrow at first base by Pieper.<br />\nHobbs' throw was accurate and<br />\nRice caught his man a foot from<br />\nthe plate. The latter's foot, however, as he slid, swung into the air<br />\nand cut a bad gash in Rice's-cheek.<br />\nBut when he had been patched up,<br />\nRice gamely kept on playing and in<br />\nthe eighth inning rapped out a<br />\nsingle that was responsible for two<br />\nruns.<br />\nPieper's excellent pitching was<br />\neasily the feature of the game. He<br />\nhad perfect control, giving only two<br />\nfree passes, while his opponent,<br />\nBowen, who pitched seven innings,<br />\npassed eight men. In addition, he<br />\nstruck out six men and only four<br />\nof the losers' six runs were batted<br />\nin, while of Hopkins' eleven runs,<br />\nseven were batted in.<br />\nThe score:<br />\n<br />\nAnna Brochhausen (Education), Supervising Principal, Indianapolis Public<br />\nSchools.<br />\nEdward F.

The promise of keeping students of the same institution together assures congenial companions. As it is probable that not<br />\nmore than twenty from Johns Hopkins will avail themselves of this<br />\nopportunity, there is no chance of<br />\na small surplus of men being put<br />\non a separate vessel. Two students<br />\nfrom the group, recommended<br />\neither by the college authorities or<br />\nthe students themselves, will be in<br />\ncharge of the squad. Over all will<br />\nbe a naval officer. The men will<br />\nnot enlist, but must bind themselves to obey the laws and regulations of the Navy. Regular uniforms will be worn, with civilian<br />\nclothes while on unofficial shore<br />\nleave. The fleet will rendezvous at<br />\nNaragansett Bay, spending one<br />\nweek in port and one at sea. Although the week at port is by no<br />\nmeans an idle one, the week at sea<br />\nshould be more enjoyable, as the<br />\nfrequent fogs and occasional gales<br />\noff the New England Coast make<br />\nthe trip very realistic. Later on in<br />\nthe summer the fleet goes to Hampton Roads, where the fleet is divided and a war game played.<br />\n<br />\nInstruction will be given as far<br />\nas possible along the lines which<br />\nthe individual has taken up at college.

The expense for uniform<br />\nand outfit will be $22, while the<br />\nboard for two months will amount<br />\nto about $26. Naval training expense will also be borne by the students until a fund has been appropriated for Naval Reserve purposes.<br />\nAs the government is back of the<br />\nplan with its ardent endeavors to<br />\nbuild up a Naval Reserve, and especially to improve the personnel<br />\nof this reserve, undoubtedly, the expenses will be kept down- to a minimum. Although we are told frankly that it is to be no summer excursion nor yachting expedition and<br />\na slight expense will be incurred,<br />\nsurely the benefit to the nation and<br />\nthe individual will be enough compensation.

The principal object of the University in making provision for the<br />\n, session is to furnish instruction to<br />\nteachers in all grades of schools,<br />\nand to other persons who seek opportunities for instruction, with or<br />\nwithout reference to an academic<br />\ndegree. Some courses offered are<br />\ndesigned to meet the needs of matriculated students who wish to advance their standing or to make up<br />\ndeficiencies; others, to enable .nonmatriculated students to absolve in<br />\npart the entrance requirements.<br />\nSo popular was this branch of<br />\nthe University last year .that 201<br />\npersons attended. The courses<br />\nwere not only popular, but so thorough that the Board of Collegiate<br />\n- Studies has made it .possible this<br />\nyear for a student to receive a maximum of one-half credit per course<br />\nins:ead of one-third as heretofore.<br />\nHowever, of the courses given in<br />\none summer session, matriculated<br />\nstudents or candidates for matriculation in the University may offer<br />\nfor credit not more than two<br />\ncourses in collegiate subjects.<br />\nThe tuition fee is $25, payment<br />\nof which entitles the student tb attend as many as three courses.<br />\nThe faculty of the summer school<br />\nconsists of twenty instructors, of<br />\nwhom four are women:<br /><br />\nIn view of the success of the<br />\ntennis team at Hopkins last season<br />\nand the interest this year displayed<br />\non all sides, a most ambitious<br />\nschedule has been arranged for the<br />\ncollege team. Numerous challenges<br />\nwere received, even from as far<br />\nwest as the University of Michigan. Some of these offers had to<br />\nbe declined because of the expense<br />\ninvolved, but the schedule, as finally<br />\nmade up, is the best that the team<br />\nhas ever had. In consists of seven<br />\nmatches\u2014three away and four in<br />\nBaltimore. The matches were arranged as much as possible for days<br />\nwhen a baseball game would not<br />\ninterfere with the playing on the<br />\ncourts.<br />\nAs announced by Manager Corner, the dates are:<br />\nSaturday, April I2\u2014Georgetown<br />\nUniversity at Homewood (afternoon).<br />\nSaturday, April 26\u2014Navy at Annapolis (afternoon).<br />\nWednesday, April 30\u2014Catholic<br />\nUniversity at Washington (afternoon).<br />\nFriday, May 2\u2014University of<br />\nPennsylvania at Homewood (afternoon).<br />\nWednesday, May 7\u2014St. John's<br />\nat Annapolis (afternoon).<br />\nSaturday, May 17\u2014Lehigh at<br />\nHomewood( morning).<br />\nThursday, May 22\u2014Haverford<br />\nat Homewood (afternoon).<br />\nHopkins has never played Catholic University, Haverford or Lehigh before. \u2022<br />\nAs the groundkeeper has promised that the dirt courts will be<br />\nthrown open for playing early this<br />\nweek, Captain Hammond will issue<br />\na call for players in the very near<br />\nfuture. The men who played at<br />\nleast once last year are: Belt, Dubray, Bacon, Hammond, Corner,<br />\nSpringer, Angell and Hatch; of<br />\nthese Dubray, Hammond, Corner<br />\nand Bacon are still at the University. It is plain that there is room<br />\nfor several new players. Those<br />\nwho practice steadily will receive<br />\nthe preference at the time of \u2022 the<br />\nchoice of the personnel of the team.<br />\nUndergraduates are to be given<br />\nevery chance. Captain Hammond<br />\nis hoping that some talent will be<br />\ndiscovered in the lower classes.<br />\nAmong the other men who are expected out this year are: Sears,<br />\nLentz, Brady, Harrop, D.

In addition, a comprehensive itinerary has been<br />\nworked out, beginning with the arrival of the delegates at Boston on<br />\nor about August 27, and ending<br />\nwith their departure from New<br />\nYork on September 16, which is<br />\nto comprise such features as a visit<br />\nto the historic spots of Boston<br />\nand Harvard University; a daylight trip on the Hudson from New<br />\nYork to Albany; a reception at the<br />\ncapitol of the Empire, State by<br />\nGovernor Sulzer; an excursion to<br />\n\"God's Grand Organ,\" the Niagara Falls; an inspection of<br />\nthe university, the United States<br />\nMint and the Curtis publishing<br />\nplant at Philadelphia; a \u2022 stay of<br />\nseveral days at Washington, with a<br />\nbrillian reception in the Hall of the<br />\nAmericas at the \u2022 Pan-American<br />\nUnion, and a less formal reception<br />\nby President Wilson, and a final reunion at New York, with a banquet by the New York Peace Society.<br />\nThe object of the congress, as<br />\nset forth in the \"call\" recently issued, is \"to bring together the representatives from all the students<br />\nof the world, in order that the<br />\nspirit of international brotherhood<br />\nand humanity may be fostered<br />\namong them as a result of the deliberations of the congress, and in<br />\norder that the students of the<br />\nworld may be united into an allembracing world organization.\"<br />\nThe congress committee has received considerable material support from the -Division for Intercourse and Education of the Carnegie Foundation, which granted<br />\na subvention of $2,500 to finance<br />\nthe undertaking, and from the<br />\nWorld Peace Foundation of Boston.

Although there were many errors and<br />\na great deal of ragged fielding, yet<br />\nthe team as a whore showed marked<br />\nimprovement over, the form displayed against Pennsylvania last<br />\nTuesday. This was particularly<br />\nnoticeable at the bat. Coach Hooper<br />\nhas been giving the squad rather<br />\nstrenuous batting practices and the<br />\nresult was appreciably heavier hitting..<br />\nHopkins gathered in three runs<br />\nin the fifth inning when Sutton<br />\nstarted off with a home-run. Williams was passed. Hobbs and Wilson both singled, and Williams and<br />\nHobbs scored. Wilson, however,<br />\nwas caught off third base and Hallock fanned, ending the inning.<br />\nThree of *Washington College's<br />\nruns came in the seventh. Frampton got to first on Hobbs' error, and<br />\nafter Pearson had flied out to Webster, Lewis rapped out a two-bagger. Then an error by Hallock and<br />\ntwo more Washington College hits<br />\ncontributed three. runs. But Hopkins came back in their half of the<br />\nseventh, and by means of singles by<br />\nBagley, Rice and Sutton, and a<br />\nhome-run by Hobbs, scored four<br />\nruns.<br />\nThe only mishap of the game occurred in the second inning. Wallace, a Washington man, attempted<br />\nto score from third on an overthrow at first base by Pieper.<br />\nHobbs' throw was accurate and<br />\nRice caught his man a foot from<br />\nthe plate. The latter's foot, however, as he slid, swung into the air<br />\nand cut a bad gash in Rice's-cheek.<br />\nBut when he had been patched up,<br />\nRice gamely kept on playing and in<br />\nthe eighth inning rapped out a<br />\nsingle that was responsible for two<br />\nruns.<br />\nPieper's excellent pitching was<br />\neasily the feature of the game. He<br />\nhad perfect control, giving only two<br />\nfree passes, while his opponent,<br />\nBowen, who pitched seven innings,<br />\npassed eight men. In addition, he<br />\nstruck out six men and only four<br />\nof the losers' six runs were batted<br />\nin, while of Hopkins' eleven runs,<br />\nseven were batted in.<br />\nThe score:<br /><br />\nAnna Brochhausen (Education), Supervising Principal, Indianapolis Public<br />\nSchools.<br />\nEdward F.

Until he returns, the editing of this paper will<br />\nbe in charge (34 a member of the<br />\nBoard.<br />\nNaval Training.<br /><br />\nT h e announcement from the<br />\nNavy Department that it will train<br />\na limited number of college students on board battleships opens a<br />\nunique and profitable way to spend<br />\ntwo months of the summer vacation. The promise of keeping students of the same institution together assures congenial companions. As it is probable that not<br />\nmore than twenty from Johns Hopkins will avail themselves of this<br />\nopportunity, there is no chance of<br />\na small surplus of men being put<br />\non a separate vessel. Two students<br />\nfrom the group, recommended<br />\neither by the college authorities or<br />\nthe students themselves, will be in<br />\ncharge of the squad. Over all will<br />\nbe a naval officer. The men will<br />\nnot enlist, but must bind themselves to obey the laws and regulations of the Navy. Regular uniforms will be worn, with civilian<br />\nclothes while on unofficial shore<br />\nleave. The fleet will rendezvous at<br />\nNaragansett Bay, spending one<br />\nweek in port and one at sea. Although the week at port is by no<br />\nmeans an idle one, the week at sea<br />\nshould be more enjoyable, as the<br />\nfrequent fogs and occasional gales<br />\noff the New England Coast make<br />\nthe trip very realistic. Later on in<br />\nthe summer the fleet goes to Hampton Roads, where the fleet is divided and a war game played.<br /><br />\nInstruction will be given as far<br />\nas possible along the lines which<br />\nthe individual has taken up at college. Instead of giving a smattering of knowledge about many diverse subjects the men will receive<br />\nthorough ground - work in o n e<br />\nbranch.<br />\nFor stuaents in the \"tech\" there<br />\nis an invaluable opportunity for<br />\nfirst hand experience with machinery. The expense for uniform<br />\nand outfit will be $22, while the<br />\nboard for two months will amount<br />\nto about $26.
