The<br />\nmovement, or lack of movement, of Hopkins towards Homewood seems<br />\nto prove what history has taught and experience proven, namely, that<br />\nthe initiative in all great movements must arise from the rank and file\u2014<br />\nin this case, from the students themselves. Of course, it is out of the<br />\nquestion for the students to supply the money, but by contributing our<br />\nmite, there is a possibility that an avalanche of financial assistance may<br />\nbe set crashing down upon the trustees. At any rate, we could more<br />\nthan double the actual amount of cash on hand\u2014twenty-five dollars.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER, therefore, proposes this year opening a subscription column for the undergraduate students, to be carried on, if desired, for several years. If each student contributed<br />\nbut fifty cents, the total would probably be sufficient to furnish the corner-stone of one of the<br />\nnew buildings, and as, after all, the fame of every university rests upon the work of its<br />\nstudents, the corner-stone would be doubly typical of the work of the undergraduate body at<br />\nHopkins.

The<br />\nmovement, or lack of movement, of Hopkins towards Homewood seems<br />\nto prove what history has taught and experience proven, namely, that<br />\nthe initiative in all great movements must arise from the rank and file\u2014<br />\nin this case, from the students themselves. Of course, it is out of the<br />\nquestion for the students to supply the money, but by contributing our<br />\nmite, there is a possibility that an avalanche of financial assistance may<br />\nbe set crashing down upon the trustees. At any rate, we could more<br />\nthan double the actual amount of cash on hand\u2014twenty-five dollars.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER, therefore, proposes this year opening a subscription column for the undergraduate students, to be carried on, if desired, for several years. If each student contributed<br />\nbut fifty cents, the total would probably be sufficient to furnish the corner-stone of one of the<br />\nnew buildings, and as, after all, the fame of every university rests upon the work of its<br />\nstudents, the corner-stone would be doubly typical of the work of the undergraduate body at<br />\nHopkins.

The<br />\nFreshmen have not yet elected their captain,<br />\nand little is known about the football material<br />\nin that class. Several have declared their<br />\nintention of coming out for their class team,<br />\nand will no doubt be in togs when the call is<br />\ngiven. On the other hand, one may be able<br />\nto get a fair idea of the 1908 team, the material for which was largely tried out last year.<br />\nOf last year's team, that is, the one which<br />\nlined tip against the present Senior Class last<br />\nFall, many are back at the University. Besides Abel, who is now captain, there are<br />\nWegefarth, Wright, Mathias, Wylie, Streett,<br />\nHecht, Bridgman, Armstrong, Chesney and<br />\nBreyer. Marcus, sub-quarter, Brenton, Tilghman and Ridgely are also at the University.<br />\nTilghman is undecided whether to play or<br />\nnot; Ridgely is uncertain, and Wright cannot<br />\nplay. The squad will have a welcome addition in Willis Thompson, of Lowell Textile<br />\nSchool, who is now a special student at the<br />\nUniversity, and a member of the Junior Class.<br />\nThe foregoing names constitute the backbone<br />\nof the Junior squad. There will doubtless be<br />\nsome additions to this list when Captain Abel<br />\ncalls the first practice.
