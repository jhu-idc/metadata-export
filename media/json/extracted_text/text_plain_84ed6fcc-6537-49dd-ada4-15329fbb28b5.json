The memorabilia smiles from its place<br />\non the mantle, and it doesn't blind you with that<br />\n'low and behold an academic' grin. It's the<br />\neXecutive toy, a fishing picture with that big one,<br />\nand the over-sized bright yellow flower from a loyal<br />\n<br />\n- Robert Strider<br />\n<br />\nsecretary--the 'what to get for the man who has<br />\neverything' series, personalized over the years.<br />\nStrider is sitting on a corner of the desk, one<br />\nwingtipped foot dragging off in the direction of the<br />\nfireplace. The wood is in a closet behind the desk.<br />\nHe has done time with textiles, construction, the<br />\nMarines and \"just bumming around the country.\"<br />\n'Working at various jobs of that type, playin'<br />\npoker.. all of these contribute to how good you are<br />\nwhen you become a dean.\"<br />\nThe laughter never interrupts the words. It gently<br />\nnudges them aside and then barrels forth for an<br />\nunfailing six syllables of its own.

NAMOR<br />\n\"A squid eating dough in a<br />\npolyethylene bag is fast n' bulbous,<br />\ngot me?\"<br />\nDon Van Vliet alias Captain<br />\nBeefheart is a musical genius. Not<br />\ngenius in the decayed common sense<br />\nof the word (everyone from Einstein<br />\nto Brooks Robinson is a genius.) But<br />\nan original creative talent producing<br />\nsignificant innovations in rock<br />\nmusic.<br />\nIn the past the Captain was known<br />\nas Frank Zappa's either mentor or<br />\nprotege, or as some freak who<br />\nlivened up under- and dangerouslyclose-to-aboveground rock mags<br />\nwith quotes like \"There are only<br />\nforty people in the world and five of<br />\nthem are hamburgers.\" This should<br />\nchange. Now Captain Beefheart, and<br />\nhis Magic Band, have released their<br />\nfourth album, titled \"Lick My<br />\nDecals Off, Baby.\"<br />\nBeefheart has progressed over<br />\nmuch territory since his musical life<br />\nbegan. \"Safe As Milk,\" the first<br />\nalbum, was done in 1964. Truly incredible that sophisticated rock<br />\nsongs like \"Electricity\" and \"Zig<br />\nZag Wanderer\" could have been<br />\ndone in an era when people were<br />\ndigging on \"Can't Buy Me Love\"<br />\nand the latest Dave Clark Five.<br />\n\"Safe As Milk\" was good rock, delta<br />\nblues, great rock, and the erratic<br />\nflights of Beefheart's voice.<br />\nTo praise Beefheart as the<br />\ngreatest white blues singer is to<br />\nunderrate his astonishing vocal<br />\nprowess. Possessing an enormous<br />\nrange, he sings with such naked<br />\noverwhelming energy that it seems<br />\nhis voice must shatter under the<br />\ntension. Never.<br />\nUnmistakeably, the Captain<br />\nexerts subtle control over every<br />\nwarped note, every unexpected<br />\ninflection. He's an oracle of a<br />\nhundred voices, one for each effect<br />\nand two or more for each song.<br />\nSometimes it's a visceral blues<br />\nbellow, in other pieces a recitation<br />\nclose to monotone (appreciation<br />\nrequires repeated listening.)<br />\nMade in 1968, \"Strictly Personal\"<br />\nwas the next album. It was the<br />\ndamburst, the seminal creation.<br />\nBeefheart's following two records<br />\nrepresent the refinement and<br />\nmaturation of the ideas behind<br />\n\"Strictly Personal.\" Although<br />\naltered somewhat without his approval before release, the album<br />\nforcefully proves the emergence of a<br />\nnew revolutionary talent whose<br />\nimpact should rival that of the first<br />\nrock genius, Chuck Berry.<br />\nThere are no horns here - the<br />\nCaptain sticks to vocals and<br />\nmouthharp - and the Magic Band<br />\nhave straight names. On two continuous sides \"Strictly Personal\"<br />\nblends everything from blues<br />\nthrough rock and jazz on into<br />\nelectronic music.<br />\nBeefheart's innovation: to destroy<br />\nthe attachment of rock to a tune (a<br />\ntraditional linear song structure.)<br />\nOnly when the bass and drums<br />\nrepeat a foundation rhythm is there<br />\nthe sense of some definition of<br />\nformal unity.(On a couple of tracks,<br />\nand occasionally on the later<br />\nalbums, the Magic Band puts<br />\ntogether some straight hard rock<br />\nthat would make the Stones envious.)<br />\nMost of the time, however, the<br />\n<br />\nCaptain Beefheart and an<br />\nbass and drums are left free to<br />\nwander and experiment on almost<br />\nthe same level as the lead instruments. Beefheart songs usually<br />\nopen with a jarring discordant<br />\nrhythm which is either developed or<br />\nabandoned for something wholly<br />\nnew, all lunging toward an often<br />\nincongruous conclusion.<br />\nBeefheart has advanced beyond<br />\nextended improvised jazz breaks<br />\n(popularized by Cream) which<br />\nmake concessions to tune at the start<br />\nand finish. This is not to say that<br />\nmelody has been denied, for it<br />\nhasn't. The crudely primitive blues<br />\npieces on \"Strictly Personal\" are<br />\noutstanding. But Beefheart's<br />\nmelodies exist as original<br />\nfragments, varying from merely<br />\ninteresting to innovative novelty.<br />\nSince \"Strictly Personal\" reliance<br />\non studio effects and distortions<br />\ndiminished considerably as the<br />\nCaptain expanded his own repetoire<br />\nof instruments and turned to the<br />\nband itself to create the weird unnatural sounds.<br />\n<br />\nFigure 2.

Much less slide guitar and<br />\n, blues, no harp, but now horns<br />\n(borrowing from Roland Kirk,<br />\nBeefheart skillfully plays tenor and<br />\nsoprano sax simultaneously on one<br />\ncut.) With a new Magic Band under<br />\nhis direction Beefheart shifts plainly<br />\ntoward the disciplined freedom of<br />\njazz.<br />\nAnd then this month, \"Lick My<br />\nDecals Off, Baby\". Clearly a third<br />\nrecord to the \"Trout Mask\" set, the<br />\nlatest album is a minor disappointment. Perhaps my expectations were too high. With the<br />\nexception of one filler instrumental<br />\nall the songs are excellent, shouting<br />\nout again the churning searching<br />\ncreativity and finely-regulated<br />\nchaos of \"Trout Mask.\" Beefheart's<br />\nsinging and musicianship excel his<br />\nprevious standards of genius, but the<br />\nprogress is one of degree and not<br />\nkind.<br />\n\"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\"<br />\nfeatures Beefheart on bass clarinet,<br />\ntenor and soprano saxes, and vocals.<br />\nBehind him the Magic Band: Zoot<br />\nHorn Rollo on electric and slide<br />\nguitars, Rockette Morton on Bass,<br />\nDrumbo on drums and former<br />\nMother Art Tripp on drums and<br />\nmarimba (an instrument never used<br />\nbefore, now adding a touch of<br />\nvariety.)<br />\nFor those who received an insufficient taste of the \"flowing\"<br />\nturmoil of Beefheart's harp figures<br />\non \"Strictly Personal,\" and<br />\nlamented its absence from \"Trout<br />\nMask,\" the Captain plays a<br />\nchromatic on \"I Love You, You Big<br />\nDummy.\" Grating unrestrained<br />\ntones pour out from the instrument,<br />\nsometimes suggesting the soundtrack to \"Forbidden Planet,\"<br />\nsometimes resembling a harp.<br />\nAdmittedly it's not the expressiveness and finesse of a Sonny<br />\nTerry or Little Walter, but then that<br />\nwas (almost) another music.<br />\nOther notable points of the new<br />\nalbum: \"Japan in a Dishpan\" is an<br />\ninstrumental, harsh blurts of tenor<br />\nprogressing from incoherence to<br />\n<br />\ninsanity, wavering riffs terminating<br />\nin forced screeches unabashedly<br />\nreminiscent of Coltrane (Beefheart<br />\nalso cites Ornette Coleman as a<br />\n,major influence.) The song ends<br />\nwith a surprise: a few juvenile solo<br />\nsax whimpers, a very funny self mocking comment on what has just<br />\ngone before.<br />\n\"Flash Gordon's Ape,\" the<br />\nrecord's longest piece, is a mournful<br />\nand very intriguing collage of bass<br />\nclarinet and tenor and soprano sax.<br />\nBut, unfortunately, th Captain limits<br />\nhis playing on the album as a whole.<br />\nMore horns and harp would have<br />\nbeen a definite improvement.<br />\nA word on the lyrics (all words and<br />\nmusic on all albums by D. Van<br />\nVliet ). Except for a few unusual<br />\nanti-war remarks on \"Trout Mask,\"<br />\nthe poetry is not tethered to<br />\nmeaning. Fragments of concrete<br />\nimages (favorites: animals and<br />\ninsects) are juxtaposed with no<br />\ncontinuity, no apparent origin or<br />\ndirection. One thing stands out: a<br />\nsatirical punning humor, a quality<br />\nalso evident in the music. Beefheart<br />\nemploys words chiefly for their<br />\nsounds and endless sound combinations.<br />\nThe lyrics become the. music,<br />\nadding color and dimension to the<br />\nmusic ( in a fusion perhaps possible<br />\nonly due to Beefheart's incredible<br />\nvocal diversity.) Some titles from<br />\nthe new album: \"I Wanna Find a<br />\nWoman That'll Hold My Big Toe Till<br />\nI Have To Go,\" \"The Smithsonian<br />\nInstitute Blues (or the Big Dig),\"<br />\n\"The Clouds are Full of Wine (not<br />\nWhiskey or Rye).\"<br />\nAfter four consecutive successes<br />\nin record making - something unprecedented in rock - the next<br />\nventure for Beefheart should be a<br />\nconcert tour. He was scheduled for<br />\nthe Atlanta festival this summer but<br />\nmissed it..A live show would be truly<br />\nunbelievable, proving to all that the<br />\nCaptain is an authentic genius.<br />\nGot me?<br />\n\"Now well you may think I'm crazy but I<br />\nwant you to lick my decals off, baby\"<br />\n<br />\n\f(3<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPage 8<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPORTS<br />\n<br />\nTerrors Stomp Blue Jays<br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br />\n<br />\nSophomore running back<br />\nJoe Brockmeyer rushed for<br />\nover 300 yards and scored<br />\nthree touchdowns as Western<br />\nMaryland rudely ended<br />\nHopkins' title hopes, 36-20, in<br />\nSaturday's game at Westminster.<br />\nA Blue Jay victory, coupled<br />\nwith<br />\nMoravian's<br />\n55-7<br />\nthrashing of Muhlenberg,<br />\nwould have given Hopkins an<br />\nunprecedented fourth<br />\nstraight MASCAC Southern<br />\nDivision crown. But the team<br />\ndidn't even come close.<br />\nThe Blue Jays spotted the<br />\nGreen Terror a 15-0 lead in<br />\nthe first five minutes of play.<br />\nDave Pickall's fumble of the<br />\nopening kickoff gave Western<br />\nMaryland the ball at the<br />\nHopkins 8.<br />\nThree plays later quarterback Mike Bricker went in<br />\nfor the score on a keeper from<br />\n4 out. After the Jays couldn't<br />\nmove the ensuing kickoff, the<br />\n<br />\nTerror came roaring right<br />\nback again.<br />\nOn a 3rd and 15 from the<br />\nHopkins 20, end Walter Orndorff made a fine catch of a<br />\nhigh Bricker aerial in the end<br />\nzone. It just seemed as if the<br />\nBlue Jays had lost before the<br />\ngame had started.<br />\nPainfully Brief<br />\nDave Nolan's runback of an<br />\nintercepted Bricker pass set<br />\nup Hopkins' first score with<br />\n1:10 to play in the first half.<br />\nFrom the Terror 11 quarterback Bob Pfeifer connected with end Bill Donovan<br />\nto the 2, from where Pat<br />\nNeary banged over on the<br />\nnext play.<br />\nThe Jays' moment of glory,<br />\nhowever, was painfully brief.<br />\nTwo plays after the kickoff<br />\nJoe Brockmeyer raced off left<br />\ntackle for 57 yards and a<br />\ntouchdown to boost the<br />\nWestern Maryland halftime<br />\nadvantage to 22-6.<br />\nTwo plays into the second<br />\n<br />\nhalf the<br />\n5' 9\", 164<br />\npound sophomore halfback<br />\nstruck again, this time off<br />\nright tackle from 44 yards<br />\naway. The little scatback was<br />\nby this time well on his way to<br />\nnotching his 1,000th yard of<br />\nthe 1970 season with his unbelievable one-man show.<br />\nThe Blue Jays came back<br />\nwith a valiant last-ditch effort, but it turned out merely<br />\ntoo little too late. Pfeifer hit<br />\nan isolated Tim Weglicki for a<br />\npretty 44-yard scoring pass,<br />\nand Butch Robey blasted_ over<br />\nfrom 1 yard out after a pass<br />\ninterference call had given<br />\nHopkins a first and goal from<br />\nthe Western Maryland 1.<br />\nThe Terror's grind-it-out<br />\noffense, however, proceeded<br />\nto put to rest any faint Blue<br />\nJay title hopes by effectively<br />\nrunning out the clock. Brockmeyer capped what was<br />\nundoubtedly the finest day<br />\nin his collegiate career by<br />\nscoring on a sweep around<br />\nleft end with 40 seconds left.<br />\n<br />\nSports Briefs<br />\nBasketball<br />\n<br />\nThe Varsity Basketball<br />\nTeam looked very good in its<br />\nfirst scrimmage of the season<br />\nagainst Baltimore University, beating them by a total<br />\nof twelve points.

It<br />\nlooks out on the quiet quadrangle. It is scrupulously<br />\nclean.<br />\nAnd the colors\u2014orange-brown combinations-are meant to leave the holder with just that right<br />\nfeeling of pressing drive and preoccupation.<br />\nBut there's no pretentiousness, even when you<br />\nlook for it. The memorabilia smiles from its place<br />\non the mantle, and it doesn't blind you with that<br />\n'low and behold an academic' grin. It's the<br />\neXecutive toy, a fishing picture with that big one,<br />\nand the over-sized bright yellow flower from a loyal<br /><br />\n- Robert Strider<br /><br />\nsecretary--the 'what to get for the man who has<br />\neverything' series, personalized over the years.<br />\nStrider is sitting on a corner of the desk, one<br />\nwingtipped foot dragging off in the direction of the<br />\nfireplace. The wood is in a closet behind the desk.<br />\nHe has done time with textiles, construction, the<br />\nMarines and \"just bumming around the country.\"<br />\n'Working at various jobs of that type, playin'<br />\npoker.. all of these contribute to how good you are<br />\nwhen you become a dean.\"<br />\nThe laughter never interrupts the words. It gently<br />\nnudges them aside and then barrels forth for an<br />\nunfailing six syllables of its own. He tries to get a<br />\n.reaction, searching for company, hand outstretched, reaching off the desk.<br />\nA Lucky Strike emerges and he lights it up. It's<br />\ntwo o'clock and the first pack of the day is almost<br />\ngone. The dean-designate for Undergraduate and<br />\nGraduate Programs is back from his usual Faculty<br />\nClub siesta.<br />\nStrider is worrisome these days. There's a tinge<br />\nof pathos. And he would much rather talk about<br />\ngovernance than himself.<br />\nHe put a lot of time in last summer chairing the<br />\ncommittee, playing the great compromiser for nine<br />\nweeks, five days a week, and now all that time is<br />\ncoming to a vote. He'd put it off or move it behind<br />\nhim if he could.<br />\n\"Thinking about the governance issue did not<br />\nbegin last spring with the Strike Committee,\" he<br />\nsays. \"Now they certainly affected the timing,<br />\ngetting it started on an emergency basis over the<br />\nsummer...and in some senses I feel a little bitter<br />\nabout this, that they managed to get accomplished<br />\nwhat I hadn't been able to get accomplished.\"<br />\nHis voice is clear and strong, but forced out over<br />\na rumbling undercurrent of unmeshed gears, and<br />\ntempered by a boyhood in Carthage, North<br />\nCarolina.<br />\nThe last of the high-ranking administrators to<br />\nhave servect, under three University presidents,<br />\nStrider has been around a long time. He's seen a lot<br /><br />\nof growth and he sees it from the point of view of<br />\nbeneficent evolution.<br />\n\"One of the advantages or disadvantages about<br />\ntime in a place is to have a little difference of<br />\nperspective...And I don't mean to imply anything<br />\nabout the good old days. But, you see, a lot of you<br />\ndon't understand that prior to two or three years<br />\nago, there were no committees that advised<br />\nanybody on anything.\"<br />\n\"Back in the fifties we were groping with the role<br />\nof the faculty.

I taught one<br />\nto three courses here for 17 years consecutively.<br />\nBut then, I got involved all along with other<br />\nthings...I even did penance one time as assistant<br />\nplant manager.\"<br />\nStrider never got his Ph.D. His field is economics<br />\nand the book shelves brim with texts on accounting<br />\nand finance. He came to Hopkins in 1950 as an instructor in the School of Business--\"the lowest of<br />\nthe low on the totem poll.\"<br />\nHe set up the first office of financial aid, rose to<br />\n.become Asst.

NAMOR<br />\n\"A squid eating dough in a<br />\npolyethylene bag is fast n' bulbous,<br />\ngot me?\"<br />\nDon Van Vliet alias Captain<br />\nBeefheart is a musical genius. Not<br />\ngenius in the decayed common sense<br />\nof the word (everyone from Einstein<br />\nto Brooks Robinson is a genius.) But<br />\nan original creative talent producing<br />\nsignificant innovations in rock<br />\nmusic.<br />\nIn the past the Captain was known<br />\nas Frank Zappa's either mentor or<br />\nprotege, or as some freak who<br />\nlivened up under- and dangerouslyclose-to-aboveground rock mags<br />\nwith quotes like \"There are only<br />\nforty people in the world and five of<br />\nthem are hamburgers.\" This should<br />\nchange. Now Captain Beefheart, and<br />\nhis Magic Band, have released their<br />\nfourth album, titled \"Lick My<br />\nDecals Off, Baby.\"<br />\nBeefheart has progressed over<br />\nmuch territory since his musical life<br />\nbegan. \"Safe As Milk,\" the first<br />\nalbum, was done in 1964. Truly incredible that sophisticated rock<br />\nsongs like \"Electricity\" and \"Zig<br />\nZag Wanderer\" could have been<br />\ndone in an era when people were<br />\ndigging on \"Can't Buy Me Love\"<br />\nand the latest Dave Clark Five.<br />\n\"Safe As Milk\" was good rock, delta<br />\nblues, great rock, and the erratic<br />\nflights of Beefheart's voice.<br />\nTo praise Beefheart as the<br />\ngreatest white blues singer is to<br />\nunderrate his astonishing vocal<br />\nprowess. Possessing an enormous<br />\nrange, he sings with such naked<br />\noverwhelming energy that it seems<br />\nhis voice must shatter under the<br />\ntension. Never.<br />\nUnmistakeably, the Captain<br />\nexerts subtle control over every<br />\nwarped note, every unexpected<br />\ninflection. He's an oracle of a<br />\nhundred voices, one for each effect<br />\nand two or more for each song.<br />\nSometimes it's a visceral blues<br />\nbellow, in other pieces a recitation<br />\nclose to monotone (appreciation<br />\nrequires repeated listening.)<br />\nMade in 1968, \"Strictly Personal\"<br />\nwas the next album. It was the<br />\ndamburst, the seminal creation.<br />\nBeefheart's following two records<br />\nrepresent the refinement and<br />\nmaturation of the ideas behind<br />\n\"Strictly Personal.\" Although<br />\naltered somewhat without his approval before release, the album<br />\nforcefully proves the emergence of a<br />\nnew revolutionary talent whose<br />\nimpact should rival that of the first<br />\nrock genius, Chuck Berry.<br />\nThere are no horns here - the<br />\nCaptain sticks to vocals and<br />\nmouthharp - and the Magic Band<br />\nhave straight names. On two continuous sides \"Strictly Personal\"<br />\nblends everything from blues<br />\nthrough rock and jazz on into<br />\nelectronic music.<br />\nBeefheart's innovation: to destroy<br />\nthe attachment of rock to a tune (a<br />\ntraditional linear song structure.)<br />\nOnly when the bass and drums<br />\nrepeat a foundation rhythm is there<br />\nthe sense of some definition of<br />\nformal unity.(On a couple of tracks,<br />\nand occasionally on the later<br />\nalbums, the Magic Band puts<br />\ntogether some straight hard rock<br />\nthat would make the Stones envious.)<br />\nMost of the time, however, the<br /><br />\nCaptain Beefheart and an<br />\nbass and drums are left free to<br />\nwander and experiment on almost<br />\nthe same level as the lead instruments. Beefheart songs usually<br />\nopen with a jarring discordant<br />\nrhythm which is either developed or<br />\nabandoned for something wholly<br />\nnew, all lunging toward an often<br />\nincongruous conclusion.<br />\nBeefheart has advanced beyond<br />\nextended improvised jazz breaks<br />\n(popularized by Cream) which<br />\nmake concessions to tune at the start<br />\nand finish. This is not to say that<br />\nmelody has been denied, for it<br />\nhasn't. The crudely primitive blues<br />\npieces on \"Strictly Personal\" are<br />\noutstanding. But Beefheart's<br />\nmelodies exist as original<br />\nfragments, varying from merely<br />\ninteresting to innovative novelty.<br />\nSince \"Strictly Personal\" reliance<br />\non studio effects and distortions<br />\ndiminished considerably as the<br />\nCaptain expanded his own repetoire<br />\nof instruments and turned to the<br />\nband itself to create the weird unnatural sounds.<br /><br />\nFigure 2.

Much less slide guitar and<br />\n, blues, no harp, but now horns<br />\n(borrowing from Roland Kirk,<br />\nBeefheart skillfully plays tenor and<br />\nsoprano sax simultaneously on one<br />\ncut.) With a new Magic Band under<br />\nhis direction Beefheart shifts plainly<br />\ntoward the disciplined freedom of<br />\njazz.<br />\nAnd then this month, \"Lick My<br />\nDecals Off, Baby\". Clearly a third<br />\nrecord to the \"Trout Mask\" set, the<br />\nlatest album is a minor disappointment. Perhaps my expectations were too high. With the<br />\nexception of one filler instrumental<br />\nall the songs are excellent, shouting<br />\nout again the churning searching<br />\ncreativity and finely-regulated<br />\nchaos of \"Trout Mask.\" Beefheart's<br />\nsinging and musicianship excel his<br />\nprevious standards of genius, but the<br />\nprogress is one of degree and not<br />\nkind.<br />\n\"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\"<br />\nfeatures Beefheart on bass clarinet,<br />\ntenor and soprano saxes, and vocals.<br />\nBehind him the Magic Band: Zoot<br />\nHorn Rollo on electric and slide<br />\nguitars, Rockette Morton on Bass,<br />\nDrumbo on drums and former<br />\nMother Art Tripp on drums and<br />\nmarimba (an instrument never used<br />\nbefore, now adding a touch of<br />\nvariety.)<br />\nFor those who received an insufficient taste of the \"flowing\"<br />\nturmoil of Beefheart's harp figures<br />\non \"Strictly Personal,\" and<br />\nlamented its absence from \"Trout<br />\nMask,\" the Captain plays a<br />\nchromatic on \"I Love You, You Big<br />\nDummy.\" Grating unrestrained<br />\ntones pour out from the instrument,<br />\nsometimes suggesting the soundtrack to \"Forbidden Planet,\"<br />\nsometimes resembling a harp.<br />\nAdmittedly it's not the expressiveness and finesse of a Sonny<br />\nTerry or Little Walter, but then that<br />\nwas (almost) another music.<br />\nOther notable points of the new<br />\nalbum: \"Japan in a Dishpan\" is an<br />\ninstrumental, harsh blurts of tenor<br />\nprogressing from incoherence to<br /><br />\ninsanity, wavering riffs terminating<br />\nin forced screeches unabashedly<br />\nreminiscent of Coltrane (Beefheart<br />\nalso cites Ornette Coleman as a<br />\n,major influence.) The song ends<br />\nwith a surprise: a few juvenile solo<br />\nsax whimpers, a very funny self mocking comment on what has just<br />\ngone before.<br />\n\"Flash Gordon's Ape,\" the<br />\nrecord's longest piece, is a mournful<br />\nand very intriguing collage of bass<br />\nclarinet and tenor and soprano sax.<br />\nBut, unfortunately, th Captain limits<br />\nhis playing on the album as a whole.<br />\nMore horns and harp would have<br />\nbeen a definite improvement.<br />\nA word on the lyrics (all words and<br />\nmusic on all albums by D. Van<br />\nVliet ). Except for a few unusual<br />\nanti-war remarks on \"Trout Mask,\"<br />\nthe poetry is not tethered to<br />\nmeaning. Fragments of concrete<br />\nimages (favorites: animals and<br />\ninsects) are juxtaposed with no<br />\ncontinuity, no apparent origin or<br />\ndirection. One thing stands out: a<br />\nsatirical punning humor, a quality<br />\nalso evident in the music. Beefheart<br />\nemploys words chiefly for their<br />\nsounds and endless sound combinations.<br />\nThe lyrics become the. music,<br />\nadding color and dimension to the<br />\nmusic ( in a fusion perhaps possible<br />\nonly due to Beefheart's incredible<br />\nvocal diversity.) Some titles from<br />\nthe new album: \"I Wanna Find a<br />\nWoman That'll Hold My Big Toe Till<br />\nI Have To Go,\" \"The Smithsonian<br />\nInstitute Blues (or the Big Dig),\"<br />\n\"The Clouds are Full of Wine (not<br />\nWhiskey or Rye).\"<br />\nAfter four consecutive successes<br />\nin record making - something unprecedented in rock - the next<br />\nventure for Beefheart should be a<br />\nconcert tour. He was scheduled for<br />\nthe Atlanta festival this summer but<br />\nmissed it..A live show would be truly<br />\nunbelievable, proving to all that the<br />\nCaptain is an authentic genius.<br />\nGot me?<br />\n\"Now well you may think I'm crazy but I<br />\nwant you to lick my decals off, baby\"<br /><br />\n(3<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPage 8<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPORTS<br /><br />\nTerrors Stomp Blue Jays<br />\nBy MARK LEIFER<br /><br />\nSophomore running back<br />\nJoe Brockmeyer rushed for<br />\nover 300 yards and scored<br />\nthree touchdowns as Western<br />\nMaryland rudely ended<br />\nHopkins' title hopes, 36-20, in<br />\nSaturday's game at Westminster.<br />\nA Blue Jay victory, coupled<br />\nwith<br />\nMoravian's<br />\n55-7<br />\nthrashing of Muhlenberg,<br />\nwould have given Hopkins an<br />\nunprecedented fourth<br />\nstraight MASCAC Southern<br />\nDivision crown. But the team<br />\ndidn't even come close.<br />\nThe Blue Jays spotted the<br />\nGreen Terror a 15-0 lead in<br />\nthe first five minutes of play.<br />\nDave Pickall's fumble of the<br />\nopening kickoff gave Western<br />\nMaryland the ball at the<br />\nHopkins 8.<br />\nThree plays later quarterback Mike Bricker went in<br />\nfor the score on a keeper from<br />\n4 out. After the Jays couldn't<br />\nmove the ensuing kickoff, the<br /><br />\nTerror came roaring right<br />\nback again.<br />\nOn a 3rd and 15 from the<br />\nHopkins 20, end Walter Orndorff made a fine catch of a<br />\nhigh Bricker aerial in the end<br />\nzone. It just seemed as if the<br />\nBlue Jays had lost before the<br />\ngame had started.<br />\nPainfully Brief<br />\nDave Nolan's runback of an<br />\nintercepted Bricker pass set<br />\nup Hopkins' first score with<br />\n1:10 to play in the first half.<br />\nFrom the Terror 11 quarterback Bob Pfeifer connected with end Bill Donovan<br />\nto the 2, from where Pat<br />\nNeary banged over on the<br />\nnext play.<br />\nThe Jays' moment of glory,<br />\nhowever, was painfully brief.<br />\nTwo plays after the kickoff<br />\nJoe Brockmeyer raced off left<br />\ntackle for 57 yards and a<br />\ntouchdown to boost the<br />\nWestern Maryland halftime<br />\nadvantage to 22-6.<br />\nTwo plays into the second<br /><br />\nhalf the<br />\n5' 9\", 164<br />\npound sophomore halfback<br />\nstruck again, this time off<br />\nright tackle from 44 yards<br />\naway. The little scatback was<br />\nby this time well on his way to<br />\nnotching his 1,000th yard of<br />\nthe 1970 season with his unbelievable one-man show.<br />\nThe Blue Jays came back<br />\nwith a valiant last-ditch effort, but it turned out merely<br />\ntoo little too late. Pfeifer hit<br />\nan isolated Tim Weglicki for a<br />\npretty 44-yard scoring pass,<br />\nand Butch Robey blasted_ over<br />\nfrom 1 yard out after a pass<br />\ninterference call had given<br />\nHopkins a first and goal from<br />\nthe Western Maryland 1.<br />\nThe Terror's grind-it-out<br />\noffense, however, proceeded<br />\nto put to rest any faint Blue<br />\nJay title hopes by effectively<br />\nrunning out the clock. Brockmeyer capped what was<br />\nundoubtedly the finest day<br />\nin his collegiate career by<br />\nscoring on a sweep around<br />\nleft end with 40 seconds left.<br /><br />\nSports Briefs<br />\nBasketball<br /><br />\nThe Varsity Basketball<br />\nTeam looked very good in its<br />\nfirst scrimmage of the season<br />\nagainst Baltimore University, beating them by a total<br />\nof twelve points. According to<br />\nsome experts, the team looks<br />\neven better than it did at this<br />\ntime last season.<br /><br />\nThe Jays thus finish out the<br />\n1970 season with a 5-4 record,<br />\ntied with Muhlenberg at 5-2 in<br />\nthe conference, half game<br />\nbehind Moravian.
