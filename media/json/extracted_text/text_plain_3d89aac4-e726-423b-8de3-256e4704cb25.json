The<br />\nradio was valued at $754.<br />\nAlso recovered were a<br />\ntelevision, an electric saw, a<br />\nvacuum cleaner, a stereo, a tape<br />\n<br />\nrecorder, and two high fidelity<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nAll the items were reportedly<br />\nstolen by one member of the<br />\nfraternity. Gam president John<br />\nGibson said, \"People knew it,<br />\nand the pressure had been on<br />\nsomeone to get the stuff back.<br />\nIt's a matter like cheating \u2014 do<br />\nyou turn in your friends?\"<br />\nFitzpatrick visited the Gam<br />\nhouse after receiving information<br />\nthat the missing radio might be<br />\nfound there. After parking his car<br />\nat the three-storey house on<br />\nCanterbury Road, the dean told<br />\nfraternity brothers, \"I would<br />\nappreciate it if all the stolen<br />\n<br />\nitems were placed in my trunk in<br />\nfive minutes. If it's not all there,<br />\nthere may be a raid by city police<br />\nlater this evening.\"<br />\nAfter a moment, he inspected<br />\nthe contents of his trunk and,<br />\nreentering the house, said, \"That<br />\nwon't do.\" More items<br />\nsubsequently appeared.<br />\nFitzpatrick returned to the<br />\nGam house at 11:00 last night<br />\nand in a 90-minute meeting,<br />\ndiscussed .possible University<br />\nactions.

Embry,<br />\nJr., \"Under the present zoning<br />\ncode, adopted recently, this<br />\nfraternity (Phi Gamma Delta) is<br />\nin a nonconforming use status<br />\nand there is no way under<br />\npresent law that this can be<br />\nrevoked by us.\"<br />\nInquiries Made<br />\nThe letter was written in<br />\nresponse to inquiries about<br />\nGam's zoning variance, arisin&<br />\nfrom a party last spring when<br />\ndamage was done tothe fraternity<br />\nhouse.

Hopkins is no exception.<br />\nUpon an initial observation of Hopkins<br />\nlife, these people seem all but invisible,<br />\nmasked by a veneer of avowed<br />\nnon-sectarianism by the University, a<br />\nsizeable Jewish minority, and a heavy<br />\nacademic load that leaves little time for<br />\nanything except studying. But when<br />\nHopkins is revealed for what it is, a<br />\ncollege of individuals, then it becomes<br />\npossible to see these people and their<br />\nactivities.<br />\nAnd their activities are varied. Some<br />\nparticipate in University-associated<br />\nreligious activities, such as the Newman<br />\nHouse or the Sunday Experiences. Others<br />\norganize their own campus activities,<br />\nsuch as Bible-reading sessions, while a few<br />\nhave little to do with the University and<br />\nonly participate in off-campus<br />\norganizations. These students are more<br />\nconcerned with the personal,<br />\nintrospective aspects of their beliefs, and<br />\nopt for a%Vxvities that they feel. are more<br />\nevolved tram the national<br />\n<br />\nMeath.<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\n<br />\nwalls of his dorm room are covered with<br />\n<br />\nmodern, youth-oriented posters of Jesus,<br />\nand he has a pocket-sized edition of the<br />\nGospel of St. John available for anyone<br />\nwho wants\u2014or needs\u2014it. The pamphlet is<br />\nannotated with the imporant passages<br />\nunderlined.<br />\nMangum said he did not have a religious<br />\nupbringing, but \"I made lim my savior in<br />\nhigh school.\" He works at a religious coffee<br />\nhouse on York Road, but says he is too busy to participate in campus activities.<br />\nOther students do participate in<br />\ncampus activities, such as a weekly<br />\nBible-reading group. The class, organized<br />\nearlier this semester by Iry Jacobs and<br />\nHarry Harper, consists of approximately<br />\nfifteen persons who read and discuss<br />\npassages from the New Testament.<br />\nAccording to Harper, the group is<br />\n\"intended just as a way for Christians to<br />\nmeet and have fellowship together.\"<br />\nUsing these standards, he deemed the<br />\nmeetings \"very successful.\"<br />\nBut Mangum holds to a different view.<br />\n\"No one here at Hopkins knows Jesus.<br />\nThe students are open to a spirit of<br />\nrebellion. They're just not saved, but a<br />\nlot of them are looking. They're hungry;<br />\nthey're thirsty.\"<br />\nHe also highly criticized religion and<br />\norganized Christianity. \"I hate Church. I<br />\ndespire religion. Jesus never said join a<br />\n<br />\nchurch. There is no denomination of<br />\nJesus Christ.

Although Dickey<br />\nwrote the screenplay, the movie and the<br />\nnovel stand opposed, and it is the movie<br />\nthat will survive (to put it in Dickey's<br />\nterms). Director Boorman brings to poet<br />\nDickey's loud and hollow celebration of<br />\nself-discovery a blend of humaneness and<br />\ncommon sense that would have<br />\nbenefitted the book, and that makes the<br />\nfilm a masterpiece.<br />\nDickey's fierce wilderness and the<br />\nterrible things that happen there give the<br />\nnarrator, Ed Gentry, a new awareness:<br />\nthey \"deliver\" him. Boorman contradicts<br />\neverything Dickey says. His four<br />\nprotagonists should never have gone on<br />\ntheir trip down the river. The film's title<br />\nis a complete irony. The film's wilderness<br />\nis not splendid or exotic, but a hazy,<br />\ndusty, monochromatic green-brown, full<br />\n<br />\nof menacing shapes and unsettling,<br />\noverloud birdcalls. It contains within<br />\nitself no necessary secrets Its river may<br />\nbe harsh, its sun merciless, but it's really<br />\nnothing more than a place where men can<br />\ncome and prey on each other.<br />\nThe real terror is not in the woods or<br />\nwater, but in men; and the real secret is<br />\nthat something evil lives in men. bobby, a<br />\nroly-poly gladhand fool- who can't say<br />\nanything that isn't bawdy, is buggered by<br />\na mountain man in the film's central<br />\nscene. I say \"central\" because everything<br />\nthe protagonists do somehow refers to<br />\nthis harrowing sequence. The wilderness<br />\nis an unsupervised playground where<br />\nvicious little boys can play out their<br />\nphallic malice. Bobby's buggering is the<br />\nfilm's most blatant expression of the<br />\nsame senseless machismo that dominates<br />\nthis world of males. Ed's and Lewis'<br />\narrows, the mountain man's shotguns,<br />\nBobby's mindless attempt on his<br />\nattacker's arrow-skewered corpse: these<br />\nall signify a sickness in men that Dickey<br />\n<br />\nsees as somehow vital to the soul. We put<br />\ndown the novel and remember the river.<br />\nWe think back on the movie, and those<br />\ncorpses hidden in the river dominate our<br />\nremembrance as they will dominate Ed's<br />\nfor all time, even as he lies in the arms of<br />\nhis wife.<br />\nHere is the only decency in this<br />\nmovie's grotesque world, among the<br />\nvarious women at the end. One of the<br />\nwomen at the boarding-house table<br />\ndescribes an enormous cucumber, reciting<br />\nits measurements with a slow twang. Is<br />\nshe dull? Of course. But in her mild<br />\nsurprise at the cucumber's size there is<br />\nrefreshing mockery of that meaningless<br />\nobsession with male genitals that seems<br />\nto have driven all menfolk completely<br />\ncrazy.<br />\nBoorman's outdoorsy Lewis (Burt<br />\nReynolds) is somewhat like Dickey's glib<br />\nand shallow character. \"The machines are<br />\ngonna fail,\" he says matter-of=factly,<br />\nstringing an elaborate, gadget-studded<br />\nbow and wearing a huge and intricate<br />\n<br />\nsportsman's wristwatch. But there's also a<br />\ntwisted aspect to Lewis' character that<br />\nwe never find in the novel: he looks<br />\nlongingly at Ed (Jon Voigt)in the light of<br />\nthe campfire, and whimpers in his sleep.<br />\nJon Voigt's Ed is a terrified, unwilling<br />\nfighter. He never revels in mere sensation<br />\nor examines the act of murder like a<br />\ncurious aesthete. While the novel's Ed<br />\nsuggests that he is a more complete<br />\nperson for having the river within him,<br />\nthe movie's Ed is only scared and guilty<br />\nfor having become another killer in the<br />\nragged wilderness.<br />\nOnly a single disappointment<br />\nThe movie is shot with exquisite<br />\nsubtlety and unobtrusive imagination,<br />\nespecially in light ot the obvious<br />\ndifficulties entailed in shooting lucid<br />\nsequences on a raging river. One of the<br />\nbest sequences (among many fine ones)<br />\ninvolves Drew, the only completely<br />\nuntarnished of the four protagonists,<br />\nexchaning country music licks with a<br />\nrural idiot-boy at a backwoods gas<br />\n<br />\nstation., he pacing and editing of this<br />\nsequence, with its several bits of<br />\nsimultaneous activity all leading up to a<br />\nfew joygful moments of explosive music,<br />\nare every bit as impressive technically as<br />\nany of the action footage. Only once is<br />\nthe technique at all disappointing. Ed's<br />\nmoonlit climb up the cliff was shot in<br />\ndaylight with a lot of filters, giving the<br />\nscene an unrealistic luminescence. (Of<br />\ncourse, every member of the film crew,<br />\nincluding Voigt, would have broken his<br />\nass if the sequence had been shot at<br />\n.night.)<br />\nIn its technique and major<br />\nperformances Deliverance is<br />\nunforgettable. It implies something true:<br />\nno vague transcendent thing awaits us in<br />\nthe woods, but futile death and endless<br />\ncruelty outside the world, that Lewis<br />\nscorns so easily. Ed's experience is not<br />\nliberating, but shattering. Boorman<br />\nsubverts all Dickey's highfalutin pretense<br />\nby showing us a rural world that no<br />\namount of Hemingway could.redeem.<br />\n<br />\nroom (impossible) , avoiding collisions<br />\nwith the drunks, watching the fisticuffs<br />\nbehind the end zone as the \"crazies\"<br />\nwould lunge for the ball and the cops<br />\ndeftly plied their nightsticks to preserve<br />\nthe peace; it was the memory of a<br />\nmome'ritious Colt victory (1958Championship - \"Sudden Death\") and a<br />\nbitter defeat (1965 Western Conference<br />\nPlayoff) , the mythological grandeur of<br />\nthe giant Marchetti, the excellence of<br />\nBerry's finely wrought hands, the flashing<br />\nfeet of Moore(the white wrapped ankles<br />\nmocking the clumsiness of would - be<br />\ntacklers).

It was the thrill of the cool man<br />\nfrom the coal mines leading his team to<br />\ncountless last second victories, the<br />\nlumbering gregariousness of \"Big Daddy\"<br />\nLipscomb (and how we mourned when he<br />\ndied that lonely death in Pittsburgh) , or<br />\nthe courage of Orr, the little man's little<br />\nman,<br />\nreturning from the hospital to catch<br />\nstation., 1 he pacing and editing of this<br />\nthe winning T.D. pass; and the common<br />\nsequence, with its several bits of<br />\ngoal, always hoped for, little realized, of<br />\nsimultaneous activity all leading up to a<br />\ngoing all the way<br />\n\"for Baltimore, for<br />\nfew joygful moments of explosive music,<br />\nMaryland, for Victory.\"<br />\nare every bit as impressive technically as<br />\nRah!!

Ed's experience is not<br />\nmyths which football's past has given to<br />\nliberating, but shattering. Boorman<br />\nthe fan. If that destruction, that<br />\nsubverts all Dickey's highfalutin pretense<br />\ndisillusionment, continues, then football,<br />\nby showing us a rural world that no<br />\nas well as the fans will lose - for neither is<br />\namount of Hemingway could'redeem.<br />\nas strong without those dreams.<br />\n<br />\nThe value of professional football was<br />\nits ability to provide a sense of<br />\ncommunity to many Americans. By this,<br />\nI mean the sharing of common<br />\nexperiences, the memory of great<br />\ntraditions, the need for mutual interests<br />\nand goals. All these were part of the<br />\nattraction of going out to the Stadium<br />\nyear after year to see a simple game<br />\nplayed again and again.<br />\nIt meant many, many things<br />\nFor Baltimore, it was the shared<br />\nexperience of finding a parking space<br />\n(difficult) , fighting your way to a rest<br />\n<br />\nft<br />\n<br />\nBy MARK CRISPIN MILLER<br />\nJohn Boorman's movie of James<br />\nDickey's gripping, stupid best-seller<br />\nDeliverance is playing at the Cinema<br />\n($2.50) in Washington, and is well worth<br />\nthe price and drive. Although Dickey<br />\nwrote the screenplay, the movie and the<br />\nnovel stand opposed, and it is the movie<br />\nthat will survive (to put it in Dickey's<br />\nterms). Director Boorman brings to poet<br />\nDickey's loud and hollow celebration of<br />\nself-discovery a blend of humaneness and<br />\ncommon sense that would have<br />\nbenefitted the book, and that makes the<br />\nfilm a masterpiece.<br />\nDickey's fierce wilderness and the<br />\nterrible things that happen there give the<br />\nnarrator, Ed Gentry, a new awareness:<br />\nthey \"deliver\" him. Boorman contradicts<br />\neverything Dickey says. His four<br />\nprotagonists should never have gone on<br />\ntheir trip down the river. The film's title<br />\nis a complete irony. The film's wilderness<br />\nis not splendid or exotic, but a hazy,<br />\ndusty, monochromatic green-brown, full<br />\n<br />\nof menacing shapes and unsettling,<br />\noverloud birdcalls. It contains within<br />\nitself no necessary secrets Its river may<br />\nbe harsh, its sun merciless, but it's really<br />\nnothing more than a place where men can<br />\ncome and prey on each other.<br />\nThe real terror is not in the woods or<br />\nwater, but in men; and the real secret is<br />\nthat something evil lives in men: bobby, a<br />\nroly-poly gladhand fool who can't say<br />\nanything that isn't bawdy, is buggered by<br />\na mountain man in the film's central<br />\nscene. I say \"central\" because everything<br />\nthe protagonists do somehow refers to<br />\nthis harrowing sequence. The wilderness<br />\nis an unsupervised playground where<br />\nvicious little boys can play out their<br />\nphallic malice. Bobby's buggering is the<br />\nfilm's most blatant expression of the<br />\nsame senseless machismo that dominates<br />\nthis world of males. Ed's and Lewis'<br />\narrows, the mountain man's shotguns,<br />\nBobby's mindless attempt on his<br />\nattacker's arrow-skewered corpse: these<br />\nall signify a sickness in men that Dickey<br />\n<br />\nsees as somehow vital to the soul. We put<br />\ndown the novel and remember the river.<br />\nWe think back on the movie, and those<br />\ncorpses hidden in the river dominate our<br />\nremembrance as they will dominate Ed's<br />\nfor all time, even as he lies in the arms of<br />\nhis wife.<br />\nHere is the only decency in this<br />\nmovie's grotesque world, among the<br />\nvarious women at the end. One of the<br />\nwomen at the boarding-house table<br />\ndescribes an enormous cucumber, reciting<br />\nits measurements with a slow twang. Is<br />\nshe dull? Of course. But in her mild<br />\nsurprise at the cucumber's size there is<br />\nrefreshing mockery of that meaningless<br />\nobsession with male genitals that seems<br />\nto have driven all menfolk completely<br />\ncrazy.<br />\nBoorman's outdoorsy Lewis (Burt<br />\nReynolds) is somewhat like Dickey's glib<br />\nand shallow character. \"The machines are<br />\ngonna fail,\" he says matter-of=factly,<br />\nstringing an elaborate, gadget-studded<br />\nbow and wearing a huge and intricate<br />\n<br />\nsportsman's wristwatch. But there's also a<br />\ntwisted aspect to Lewis' character that<br />\nwe never find in the novel: he looks<br />\nlongingly at Ed (Jon Voigt)in the light of<br />\nthe campfire, and whimpers in his sleep.<br />\nJon Voigt's Ed is a terrified, unwilling<br />\nfighter. He never revels in mere sensation<br />\nor examines the act of murder like a<br />\ncurious aesthete. While the novel's Ed<br />\nsuggests that he is a more complete<br />\nperson for having the river within him,<br />\nthe movie's Ed is only scared and guilty<br />\nfor having become another killer in the<br />\nragged wilderness.<br />\nOnly a single disappointment<br />\nThe movie is shot with exquisite<br />\nsubtlety and unobtrusive imagination,<br />\nespecially in light of the obvious<br />\ndifficulties entailed in shooting lucid<br />\nsequences on a raging river.

But this is old<br />\nhome week with smiling Jack<br />\nMann having displayed his wares<br />\nwith the Houston Rockets<br />\nTuesday night, and now tonight,<br />\nMr. Bullet, Baltimore's legendary<br />\n\"Honeycomb,\" Gus Johnson, is<br />\ncoming back to where it all<br />\nbegan.<br />\nIt came as a shock to some<br />\nwhen Johnson was finally dealt<br />\naway for a mere draft choice<br />\nfollowing the Bullet's losing<br />\neffort in the playoffs last year.<br />\nYet there were signs that the<br />\ninjury prone 6'6\" acrobat was<br />\nnearing the end of the line<br />\ndespite occasional flashes of<br />\ngreatness. Still a great many fans<br />\nthought that pride would carry<br />\nthe old legs beyond the limits<br />\nthat pain would endure, and even<br />\nin an impossible conflict with the<br />\npowerful New York<br />\nKnickerbockers, Johnson would<br />\npull the team through. Perhaps<br />\nhe would have, if only someone<br />\nhad turned the clock back ten<br />\nyears.<br />\nAt that time, the San<br />\nFrancisco Warriors had the 1963<br />\ndraft all figured out. They were<br />\n<br />\nbasing their entire system on the<br />\nselection of a \"sleeper\", an<br />\nunknown entity from the<br />\nUniversity of Idaho that no one<br />\nelse could possibly have known<br />\nabout. Still the Warriors sweated<br />\nas team after team made their<br />\nselection until .the new Baltimore<br />\nfranchise was left. \"Baltimore<br />\nchooses Gus Johnson of Idaho,\"<br />\nthe voice on the telehpone<br />\nboomed, and the entire San<br />\nFrancisco draft was ruined.<br />\nHowever, despite an amazing<br />\ndebut, Johnson never got the<br />\npress that was his due. As a<br />\nrookie, he outplayed Jerry Lucas<br />\nin the All-Star game while Lucas<br />\ngot the M.V.P. He was three<br />\ntimes an All-Pro, five times an<br />\nA..-Star, and there are quite a<br />\nfew basketball buffs who felt he<br />\nwas slighted in both these<br />\ncategories. What Baltimore fans<br />\nreally didn't realize, is that<br />\nduring those early lean years, the<br />\nfranchise remained in Baltimore<br />\nonly because of one man, Gus<br />\nJohnson. Without Johnson to<br />\ndraw them in, basketball would<br />\nhave closed up in this city, a lot<br />\nearlier than next year's scheduled<br />\nfarewell date.<br />\nAll those years \"Number 25\"<br />\nwas the best forward in<br />\nbasketball.

The<br />\nCouncil is scheduled to vote on<br />\nthe minimester proposals at its<br />\nnext meeting.<br />\nThe proposals before the<br />\nCouncil range from guidelines on<br />\ncredit for courses to maintaining<br />\nthe voluntary nature of the<br />\nintersession program.<br />\nThe nine recommendations<br />\nresulted from a report prepared<br />\nby a sub -committee of the<br />\n3<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies (CUS). Dr. Mary<br />\nAinsworth, Psychology, headed<br />\nthe investigatory group.<br />\nCompiled last spring and<br />\nsubmitted in June, the report<br />\nPresented data on the scope and<br />\neffectiveness of last year's<br />\nintersession drawn from<br />\nquestionaires submitted by<br />\nstudents and faculty associated<br />\nWith the program.<br />\nThe report addressed itself<br />\nPrimarily to the question of<br />\nWhether or not the current<br />\nminimester system is satisfactory.<br />\nDr. Sigmund Suskind, Dean for<br />\nAcademic Programs and<br />\nChairman of CUS, commented<br />\nthat the group was \"generally<br />\nPretty satisfied,\" with the<br />\nstructure of intersession.<br />\nThe subcommittee proposals,<br />\nalready voted on by the CUS,<br />\nincluded plans for the<br />\nclarification of the procedure for<br /><br />\nDr. Mary Ainsworth<br />\nthe granting credit and grades. \"the entirely voluntary nature of<br />\nThe report supported and<br />\nthe Hopkins intersession is,<br />\nrecommended maintenance of<br />\nperhaps, unique among<br />\nthe voluntary aspects of the<br />\ninstitutions conducting similar<br />\nminimester.<br />\nprograms.\"<br />\nSuskind noted, \"People at<br />\nAlso before the Academic<br />\nHopkins don't like to be locked<br />\nCouncil, whose decisions will be<br />\ninto agreements.\" He added that<br />\nmade public following their<br /><br />\n.111111111110..-_<br /><br />\nWarren recommended that<br />\nstudents consult their Manual for<br />\nUndergraduates concerning<br />\nregistration procedures.

An indicator of the<br />\n.;ize of the current intersession<br />\ncourse selection is that their<br />\nisting will require twice the<br />\nnumber of pages used for last<br />\nyear's publication of courses.<br />\nMany departments are not<br />\nDffering any formal courses this<br />\nJanuary.<br /><br />\nHAC slows solicitors' activities on campus<br />\nThe Homewood Advisory<br />\nCouncil (HAC) approved<br />\nWednesday a revision of Hopkins'<br />\nsolicitation policy to allow<br />\nsoliciting only outside the new<br />\nHopkins Union.<br />\nUntil recently, solicitation of<br />\nany type on campus was<br />\nprohibited. Dean George Owen<br />\nsaid that \"the purpose (of the<br />\nrevision) is to protect the<br />\ninterests of the students.\"<br />\nThe HAC proposal provides<br /><br />\nSC warning to frats<br />\nproves unfounded<br />\nBy RICHARD BLAND<br />\nA mistaken report circulated<br />\n.at the<br />\nWednesday night meeting<br />\nOf, the Student Council stating<br />\nthat a City Council rezonin<br />\ng vote<br />\n111 January might force<br />\nf<br />\nraternities to abandon the<br />\nresidenti<br />\nal areas where they are<br />\nPresently located.<br />\nAt the SC meeting, Council<br />\nPresident Andy Savitz motioned<br />\nthat \"The Counci<br />\nl ought to<br />\nadvise the frats to get their<br />\nshit<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\n.A letter of Novemb<br />\ner 12 from<br />\nCity Counci<br />\nl President Walter<br />\nOrlinsky to the University,<br />\nhowever, promised that the City<br />\nCouncil would not make any<br />\nattempt to dislodge the<br />\nfr<br />\naternities from their current<br />\nre<br />\nsidences.<br />\nOther business of the Council<br />\nlast night include<br />\nd a report on<br />\nlast<br />\nThursday's public hearing on<br />\nthe Honor Code.<br />\nSophomore<br />\nP<br />\nresident Jim Nelson, a member<br />\nof the<br />\nHonor Commission Study<br />\nPanel, stated that the<br />\nhearing had<br />\nbeen<br />\n\"discouraging.\" Savitz<br />\nclaimed that the affair had been<br />\n.<br />\nsimilar \"to holding an open<br />\nhearing on robbery and asking<br />\nthe<br />\nburglars to attend.\" Nelson<br />\ndespondently<br />\nadded \"we also<br />\nasked the<br />\nmerchants to show up.<br />\nand they<br />\ndidn't.\"<br />\nTh<br />\neChai<br />\nHearing rman of the Public<br />\nBurton Sheppard,<br />\nsuggested that perhaps the low<br />\nturnout<br />\nwas<br />\nthat no encouraging as a sign<br />\none cared about the<br /><br />\nWednesday meeting, will be<br />\nproposals for further funding and<br />\nexpansion of course offerings.<br />\nCourse lists and registration<br />\ninstruction for intersession and<br />\nthe upcoming spring semester are<br />\nto appear in student mailboxes<br />\nsometime next week, according<br />\nto Registrar, David Warren. The<br />\nexpanded intersession course<br />\nofferings show a particularly<br />\nheavy emphasis in the field of<br />\npsychology.<br />\nIn accord with the minimester<br />\nphilosophy of informal,low-ratio<br />\nstudent-faculty interaction and<br />\nconsideration of subjects perhaps<br />\nbeyond the scope of the normal<br />\nsemester structure, course<br />\nofferings will run the gamut from<br />\nPre-Raphaelite Painting and<br />\nPoetry (English) to Field Trips to<br />\n.Sewage and Waterwork Plants<br />\n(Geography and Environmental<br />\nEngineering).<br /><br />\nthe area outside the new Hopkins<br />\nUnion for solicitation.

Dean<br />\nof students Bob Fitzpatrick cited<br />\ninvestment policy solicitors and<br />\nHare Krishna groups as past<br />\nnuisances for Hopkins students.<br />\nThe HAC also voted to add<br />\none more member to their ranks<br />\nto represent the non-union,<br />\nnon-faculty employees of the<br />\nUniversity.

Although<br />\nthe youth vote did not go<br />\nstrongly for' McGovern,<br />\nCummings pointed to polls<br />\nshowing that the ,under-30 year<br />\nold voters broke five to three in<br />\nfavor of/ Democratic candidates<br /><br />\nDr. Milton Cummings: \"Just consider where we stood....\"<br />\ngenerally.<br />\nCummings' predictions of the<br />\nfuture did not go beyond his<br />\nstatement that he expected<br />\nDemocratic National<br />\nChairwoman Jean Westwood to<br />\nbe replaced.

But Cummings.<br />\nraised the question of whether<br />\nKennedy would want it.<br />\nCummings cautioned<br />\nDemocrats against over-optimism<br />\nregarding an Agnew nomination<br />\nin 1976. \"Agnew could well be a<br />\nformidable, candidate by '76,\"<br />\nremarked Cummings. \"I expect<br />\n,him to move to the center.\"<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n'HARLEY'S ORIGINAL<br />\nSANDWICH CREATIONS<br />\n3111 St. Paul Street<br /><br />\nSPECIAL<br />\nNOTICE<br />\nStudent<br />\nand<br />\nFaculty<br />\nDiscounts<br />\nON<br />\nGoodyear Tires'<br />\nGates Tires<br />\nRecapped Tires<br />\nMonarch Tires<br /><br />\nauto repairs<br />\nBrakes<br />\nAlignment<br />\nTune-Up<br />\nGrease &amp; Oil Change<br />\nShock Absorbers<br />\nMufflers<br />\nAnti-Freeze<br />\nWheels<br />\nSeveral Credit Plans Available<br /><br />\nPaul<br />\nSchnitzer<br />\n\u2022 Tire Co.<br />\n1027 - 39 .<br />\n\u2022<br />\nHillen St.<br />\n539 - 5390<br />\n216<br />\n~111Pinmeninummommimmimi*<br /><br />\n\u2022 MUST BRING<br />\nTHIS AD<br />\nWITH YOU<br /><br />\nTHIS WINTER RECESS,<br />\nTWA HAS THE BEST WAYS<br />\nTO DO EUROPE<br />\nYOUR OWN WAY.<br />\nTWA.IF YOU WANT GREAT CITY<br />\nAND SKI PACKAGES.<br />\nCities like London,Paris, Rome and Amsterdam.(Only with TWA can you leave when<br />\nyou want.)For example,for only $50.00 plus airfare, you can get 7 days in London.<br />\nIncluding a room with private bath, breakfast,four tickets to the London theatre,free<br />\nadmission to six discos and much more.<br />\nOr,there are our Great Ski Packages to places like St. Moritz,Zermatt and Innsbruck.<br />\nLike for only $68.00 plus airfare, you can get 7 days at St. Moritz.

According<br />\nto George Owen, Deari of the<br />\nArts and Sciences division, a<br />\ncommittee has been formed to<br />\nconduct a serious study of<br />\nHopkins teaching staff.<br />\nAlthough Owen said that a<br />\ndefinitive approach to teacher<br />\nevaluation has not as yet been<br />\ndecided upon, \"sentiment\"<br />\nappears to lean toward a \"teacher<br />\npoll,\" in which students would<br />\nforward their opinions of their<br />\nrespective instructors. The<br />\nCouncil would foot the bill for<br />\nthis endeavor.<br />\nIn addition, Owen stated that<br />\nall future promotions concerning<br />\nthe instructing staff would be<br />\nawarded on the basis of both<br />\n\"scholarship and teaching<br />\nability.\" In the past, only the<br />\nlatter was considered, according<br />\nto Owen.<br /><br />\nDr. Maurice Mandlebaum<br />\nThe Dean also mentioned that<br />\na committee which is reviewing<br />\nthe Blue Ribbon Panel's final<br />\nreport of last year, which<br />\nrecommended reforms along<br />\nvarious academic lines, is now in<br />\noperation. \"A major part of the<br />\nBlue Ribbon Panel reforms have<br />\nbeen implemented or are under<br />\nconsideration.\" Owen said.<br />\nDr. Maurice Mandelbaum,<br />\nPhilosophy, a member of the<br /><br />\nCouncil, felt it was best that<br />\nday-to-day progress remain<br />\nconfidential until all committee<br />\nwork was completed.<br />\nMandelbaum remarked, \"If 12<br />\npeople talk about what's going<br />\non, you get a very confused<br />\npicture.\"<br />\nMandelbaum stated that he is<br />\ncurrently serving on a<br />\nsub-committee whose purpose is<br />\nto discuss undergraduate<br />\nprograms, and that a new<br />\ncommittee which will affect<br />\nundergraduate curriculum has<br />\nbeen initiated. Mandelbaum<br />\nrefused to comment on the<br />\nnature of the latter committee.<br />\nDr. Owen Phillips, Earth &amp;<br />\nPlanetary Sciences, chairman of<br />\nthe sub -committee on<br />\nundergraduate programs, stated<br />\nthat his group was searching for a<br />\nmeans of improving the quality<br />\nof teaching at Hopkins.

Hopkins is no exception.<br />\nUpon an initial observation of Hopkins<br />\nlife, these people seem all but invisible,<br />\nmasked by a veneer of avowed<br />\nnon-sectarianism by the University, a<br />\nsizeable Jewish minority, and a heavy<br />\nacademic load that leaves little time for<br />\nanything except studying. But when<br />\nHopkins is revealed for what it is, a<br />\ncollege of individuals, then it becomes<br />\npossible to see these people and their<br />\nactivities.<br />\nAnd their activities are varied. Some<br />\nparticipate in University-associated<br />\nreligious activities, such as the Newman<br />\nHouse or the Sunday Experiences. Others<br />\norganize their own campus activities,<br />\nsuch as Bible-reading sessions, while a few<br />\nhave little to do with the University and<br />\nonly participate in off-campus<br />\norganizations. These students are more<br />\nconcerned with the personal,<br />\nintrospective aspects of their beliefs, and<br />\nopt for a%Vxvities that they feel. are more<br />\nevolved tram the national<br /><br />\nMeath.<br /><br />\nThe<br /><br />\nwalls of his dorm room are covered with<br /><br />\nmodern, youth-oriented posters of Jesus,<br />\nand he has a pocket-sized edition of the<br />\nGospel of St. John available for anyone<br />\nwho wants\u2014or needs\u2014it. The pamphlet is<br />\nannotated with the imporant passages<br />\nunderlined.<br />\nMangum said he did not have a religious<br />\nupbringing, but \"I made lim my savior in<br />\nhigh school.\" He works at a religious coffee<br />\nhouse on York Road, but says he is too busy to participate in campus activities.<br />\nOther students do participate in<br />\ncampus activities, such as a weekly<br />\nBible-reading group. The class, organized<br />\nearlier this semester by Iry Jacobs and<br />\nHarry Harper, consists of approximately<br />\nfifteen persons who read and discuss<br />\npassages from the New Testament.<br />\nAccording to Harper, the group is<br />\n\"intended just as a way for Christians to<br />\nmeet and have fellowship together.\"<br />\nUsing these standards, he deemed the<br />\nmeetings \"very successful.\"<br />\nBut Mangum holds to a different view.<br />\n\"No one here at Hopkins knows Jesus.<br />\nThe students are open to a spirit of<br />\nrebellion. They're just not saved, but a<br />\nlot of them are looking. They're hungry;<br />\nthey're thirsty.\"<br />\nHe also highly criticized religion and<br />\norganized Christianity. \"I hate Church. I<br />\ndespire religion. Jesus never said join a<br /><br />\nchurch. There is no denomination of<br />\nJesus Christ. Jesus wasn't a religion.\"<br />\nOne member of the Bible-reading<br />\ngroup disputes that, and cites the<br />\nTestament for her evidence. Bo'ots<br />\nHahalyak, also a freshman, pointed out<br />\nthat \"Christ founded a Church. He told<br />\nPeter that he, Peter, was going to be the<br />\nhead of a Church: 'When two or three are<br />\ngathered in my name.'\"<br />\nThey also disputed the existence of a<br />\nreligious revival among youth. Mangum<br />\nclaimed, \"The kids now following Jesus<br />\nChrist were those who had damned<br />\nsociety. Now they've found Jesus...they<br />\nwere lost,just traveling, freaked out.\"<br />\nBut Hahalyak said that she was \"not so<br />\nsure there is\" a revival She claimed that<br />\nBaltimore lacks an organized religious<br />\nmovement such a Young Life, which she<br />\ndescribed as \"very big\" in her hometown,<br />\nPittsburgh.<br />\nBoth condemned Jesus Christ,<br />\nSuperstar, a record and show that appears<br />\nto be very popular with everybody buts,<br />\nthose who say they are faithful followers<br />\nof Christ. Hahalyak said, \"I don't think<br />\nit's Christian. It's very poor.\" They<br />\nva:xseci 12;\u2022\\\\N<br /><br />\nVAVATC\\\u2014W1.26:0.Wra<br /><br />\ncalked<br /><br />\nIn addition, Mangum spoke highly of<br /><br />\nExplo '72, a huge youth revival meeting<br />\nheld in Dallas' Cotton Bowl stadium this<br />\nsummer. It was perhaps best<br />\ncharacterized by the several reports of<br />\noverzealous youths fiercely trying to<br />\nproselytize members of the Dallas police<br />\nforce on downtown streets.<br />\nMangum said that, if \"Jesus freak\" was<br />\nthe phrase used to describe those who<br />\nbelieved as he did, then that was what he<br />\nwas. But Hahalyak, when asked if she<br />\nwould call herself a \"Jesus freak,\"<br />\nresponded by saying \"No way!\" She said<br />\nthose who have just been converted<br />\nsometime turn others off because of their<br />\nfanaticism. \"They turn more people<br />\naway. It depends upon the person they<br />\nencounter. Some will become believers<br />\nSome will be turned away, and hopefully<br />\nthey will meet others who will convince<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nThere is no unified Jesus movement at<br />\nHomewood . People believe what they<br />\nwish to believe, and go their separate<br />\nways. Views range from the quiet and<br />\nmild to the extreme and crusading. An<br />\noutsider can more readily comprehend<br />\nand condone the former view. But he is<br />\nmoe likely to be bewildered by the more<br />\nzealous Viewpoint which seems<br />\ndetermined, as William Jennings Bryant<br />\nsaid in a somewhat different context, \"to<br />\ncrucify mankind on a cross of gold.\"<br /><br />\nIt's been a rough few weeks for Hopkins fraternities.<br />\nFrom the accusations of paint throwing to the rumors<br />\nthat rezoning might force them to close (neither true),<br />\nto the revelations of suspected thievery by one<br />\nmember, the future of fraternities has plainly become<br />\nuncertain. While some people do not look upon them<br />\nwith favor, there can be no doubt that fraternities<br />\nperform a useful service despite their faults. For many<br />\nstudents, fraternities provide a place to live and a place<br />\nto find friends. And some fraternities are ,t r uly far<br />\nfrom the stereotype of loud, inconsiderate,<br />\nbeer-drinking jocks. As one administrator remarked<br />\nafter attending a cocktail party at a fraternity last<br />\nnight, \"I was extremely impressed. They seemed like a<br />\nterrific bunch of guys.\"<br />\nBut it would not be constructive for all fraternities<br />\nto take the attitude expressed by one house president,<br />\n\"The great goddess of fate has done us bad.\" If<br />\nfraternities are to survive and continue to provide<br />\nstudents with a place to live other than the<br />\novercrowded student ghetto, they must begin not only<br />\nto act responsibly, but also to seek ways they can<br />\nbecome part of their neighborhoods, instead of being<br />\nthe objects of complaints within them.<br /><br />\nBy STANLEY SNYDER<br />\nThe constant success of the Baltimore<br />\nColts over the years has lets us see the<br />\nbeneficial effects of the professional game<br />\non the local community. The success of<br />\nthe pro game, however, cannot conceal<br />\nthe negative aspects of its autumnal<br />\nmadness, nor can it deter the observation<br />\nthat a fundamental clash exists between<br />\nthe fiction of football's past and the<br />\nmenacing realities of the present.<br />\nProfessional football appeals to some<br />\nof the worst elements of the American<br />\ncharacter, and yet it succeeds in capturing<br />\nthe imagination of the American sports<br />\nfan. It places a premium on size; and<br />\nthough speed ,and quickness<br />\nimportant to the game, it is the massive<br />\nbigness of the bulky linemen that awes<br />\nthe spectator. How appropriate for a<br />\nnation that prides itself for jumbo jets<br />\nand supermarkets.<br />\nViolence is the heart of the game. The<br />\ndark obession that Americans have shown<br />\nin the past for violence is nowhere more<br />\nevident than on the football field. One<br />\nneeds only to hear the shouts of sadistic<br />\ndelight that erupt from the crowd when a<br />\nwatteck-Nack ks \\late&amp; ttom the blinck side<br />\nle me s impose<br />\nle pa s<br />\na<br />\nbetween the contact<br />\n________ on the field and the<br />\n--- ---<br /><br />\nspectators in the stands. This muting of<br />\nthe appeal to viciousness is deceiving: it<br />\nlets the fan glory in the physical contact<br />\nwithout seeing close at hand the pain that<br />\nis being inflicted upon the athletes in the<br />\n\"pit.\"<br />\nThe territorial aspects of the sport<br />\nsatisfy our historical impulse to expand<br />\nour nation at the expense of others. What<br />\na delightful and simplistic appeal this<br />\nsport makes to this urge - gain enough<br />\nground from the opposition and you<br />\nscore, and eventually you win. Then you<br />\nare truly \"number one.\"<br /><br />\n.\u2022<br /><br />\n***<br /><br />\nThe immense popularity of<br />\nprofessional football is a fairly recent<br />\noccurence on the American scene. Not<br />\nuntil the post-World War II years did the<br />\ngame really begin to capture the<br />\nimagination of middle-class America.<br />\nToday, the game's fans are predominantly<br />\nmiddle and upper class citizens, for the<br />\nprice of a season ticket is prohibitive for<br />\nthe poor or blue collar laborer who wants<br />\nto attend games on a regular basis. It is<br />\nthe relationship between the professional<br />\ngame and its middle class clientel that has<br />\nmade professional football popular, and it<br />\nis this relationship that interests me.<br />\nThe last two decades has seen the flight<br />\nof the white middle class to suburbia.<br />\nThis exodus from the citiesunfortunately<br /><br />\nhas lacked the \"covenant\" necessary to<br />\nbind the disparate suburban elements into<br />\na coherent unity. The sense of<br />\ncommunity which has traditionally been<br />\nthe strength of a city could not be<br />\ndeveloped in suburbia, which by its very<br />\nnature isolates each individual into his<br />\nown separate world. This isolation was<br />\naggravated by the tendency of the<br />\nAmerican family to move around<br />\nconstantly, rarely settling down for an<br />\nappreciable length of time. These factors<br />\ntogether contributed to an unstle and<br />\ndeleterious situation.<br /><br />\nThe value of professional football was<br />\nits ability to provide a sense of<br />\ncommunity to many Americans. By this,<br />\nI mean the sharing of common<br />\nexperiences, the memory of great<br />\ntraditions, the need for mutual interests<br />\nand goals. All these were part of the<br />\nattraction of going out to the Stadium<br />\nyear after year to see a simple game<br />\nplayed again and again.<br />\nIt meant many, marry things<br />\nFor Baltimore, it was the shared<br />\nexperience of finding a parking space<br />\n(difficult) , fighting your way to a rest<br /><br />\n_Dickey and Boorman's Deliverance<br /><br />\nA sickness in men that is somehow vital to their souls<br /><br />\nBy MARK CRISPIN MILLER<br />\nJohn Boorman's movie of James<br />\nDicke y's gripping, stupid best-seller<br />\nDeliverance is playing at the Cinema<br />\n($2.50) in Washington, and is well worth<br />\nthe price and drive. Although Dickey<br />\nwrote the screenplay, the movie and the<br />\nnovel stand opposed, and it is the movie<br />\nthat will survive (to put it in Dickey's<br />\nterms). Director Boorman brings to poet<br />\nDickey's loud and hollow celebration of<br />\nself-discovery a blend of humaneness and<br />\ncommon sense that would have<br />\nbenefitted the book, and that makes the<br />\nfilm a masterpiece.<br />\nDickey's fierce wilderness and the<br />\nterrible things that happen there give the<br />\nnarrator, Ed Gentry, a new awareness:<br />\nthey \"deliver\" him. Boorman contradicts<br />\neverything Dickey says. His four<br />\nprotagonists should never have gone on<br />\ntheir trip down the river. The film's title<br />\nis a complete irony. The film's wilderness<br />\nis not splendid or exotic, but a hazy,<br />\ndusty, monochromatic green-brown, full<br /><br />\nof menacing shapes and unsettling,<br />\noverloud birdcalls. It contains within<br />\nitself no necessary secrets Its river may<br />\nbe harsh, its sun merciless, but it's really<br />\nnothing more than a place where men can<br />\ncome and prey on each other.<br />\nThe real terror is not in the woods or<br />\nwater, but in men; and the real secret is<br />\nthat something evil lives in men. bobby, a<br />\nroly-poly gladhand fool- who can't say<br />\nanything that isn't bawdy, is buggered by<br />\na mountain man in the film's central<br />\nscene. I say \"central\" because everything<br />\nthe protagonists do somehow refers to<br />\nthis harrowing sequence. The wilderness<br />\nis an unsupervised playground where<br />\nvicious little boys can play out their<br />\nphallic malice. Bobby's buggering is the<br />\nfilm's most blatant expression of the<br />\nsame senseless machismo that dominates<br />\nthis world of males. Ed's and Lewis'<br />\narrows, the mountain man's shotguns,<br />\nBobby's mindless attempt on his<br />\nattacker's arrow-skewered corpse: these<br />\nall signify a sickness in men that Dickey<br /><br />\nsees as somehow vital to the soul. We put<br />\ndown the novel and remember the river.<br />\nWe think back on the movie, and those<br />\ncorpses hidden in the river dominate our<br />\nremembrance as they will dominate Ed's<br />\nfor all time, even as he lies in the arms of<br />\nhis wife.<br />\nHere is the only decency in this<br />\nmovie's grotesque world, among the<br />\nvarious women at the end. One of the<br />\nwomen at the boarding-house table<br />\ndescribes an enormous cucumber, reciting<br />\nits measurements with a slow twang. Is<br />\nshe dull? Of course. But in her mild<br />\nsurprise at the cucumber's size there is<br />\nrefreshing mockery of that meaningless<br />\nobsession with male genitals that seems<br />\nto have driven all menfolk completely<br />\ncrazy.<br />\nBoorman's outdoorsy Lewis (Burt<br />\nReynolds) is somewhat like Dickey's glib<br />\nand shallow character. \"The machines are<br />\ngonna fail,\" he says matter-of=factly,<br />\nstringing an elaborate, gadget-studded<br />\nbow and wearing a huge and intricate<br /><br />\nsportsman's wristwatch. But there's also a<br />\ntwisted aspect to Lewis' character that<br />\nwe never find in the novel: he looks<br />\nlongingly at Ed (Jon Voigt)in the light of<br />\nthe campfire, and whimpers in his sleep.<br />\nJon Voigt's Ed is a terrified, unwilling<br />\nfighter. He never revels in mere sensation<br />\nor examines the act of murder like a<br />\ncurious aesthete. While the novel's Ed<br />\nsuggests that he is a more complete<br />\nperson for having the river within him,<br />\nthe movie's Ed is only scared and guilty<br />\nfor having become another killer in the<br />\nragged wilderness.<br />\nOnly a single disappointment<br />\nThe movie is shot with exquisite<br />\nsubtlety and unobtrusive imagination,<br />\nespecially in light ot the obvious<br />\ndifficulties entailed in shooting lucid<br />\nsequences on a raging river. One of the<br />\nbest sequences (among many fine ones)<br />\ninvolves Drew, the only completely<br />\nuntarnished of the four protagonists,<br />\nexchaning country music licks with a<br />\nrural idiot-boy at a backwoods gas<br /><br />\nstation., he pacing and editing of this<br />\nsequence, with its several bits of<br />\nsimultaneous activity all leading up to a<br />\nfew joygful moments of explosive music,<br />\nare every bit as impressive technically as<br />\nany of the action footage. Only once is<br />\nthe technique at all disappointing. Ed's<br />\nmoonlit climb up the cliff was shot in<br />\ndaylight with a lot of filters, giving the<br />\nscene an unrealistic luminescence. (Of<br />\ncourse, every member of the film crew,<br />\nincluding Voigt, would have broken his<br />\nass if the sequence had been shot at<br />\n.night.)<br />\nIn its technique and major<br />\nperformances Deliverance is<br />\nunforgettable. It implies something true:<br />\nno vague transcendent thing awaits us in<br />\nthe woods, but futile death and endless<br />\ncruelty outside the world, that Lewis<br />\nscorns so easily. Ed's experience is not<br />\nliberating, but shattering. Boorman<br />\nsubverts all Dickey's highfalutin pretense<br />\nby showing us a rural world that no<br />\namount of Hemingway could.redeem.<br /><br />\nroom (impossible) , avoiding collisions<br />\nwith the drunks, watching the fisticuffs<br />\nbehind the end zone as the \"crazies\"<br />\nwould lunge for the ball and the cops<br />\ndeftly plied their nightsticks to preserve<br />\nthe peace; it was the memory of a<br />\nmome'ritious Colt victory (1958Championship - \"Sudden Death\") and a<br />\nbitter defeat (1965 Western Conference<br />\nPlayoff) , the mythological grandeur of<br />\nthe giant Marchetti, the excellence of<br />\nBerry's finely wrought hands, the flashing<br />\nfeet of Moore(the white wrapped ankles<br />\nmocking the clumsiness of would - be<br />\ntacklers). It was the thrill of the cool man<br />\nfrom the coal mines leading his team to<br />\ncountless last second victories, the<br />\nlumbering gregariousness of \"Big Daddy\"<br />\nLipscomb (and how we mourned when he<br />\ndied that lonely death in Pittsburgh) ,or<br />\nthe courage of Orr, the little man's little<br />\nman, returning from the hospital to catch<br />\nthe winning T.D. pass; and the common<br />\ngoal, always hoped for, little realized, of<br />\ngoing all the way<br />\n\"for Baltimore, for<br />\nMaryland, for Victory.\"<br />\nRah!!

Hopkins is no exception.<br />\nUpon an initial observation of Hopkins<br />\nlife, these people seem all but invisible,<br />\nmasked by a veneer of avowed<br />\nnon-sectarianism by the University, a<br />\nsizeable Jewish minority, and a heavy<br />\nacademic load that leaves little time for<br />\nanything except studying. But when<br />\nHopkins is revealed for what it is, a<br />\ncollege of individuals, then it becomes<br />\npossible to see these people and their<br />\nactivities.<br />\nAnd their activities are varied. Some<br />\nparticipate in University-associated<br />\nreligious activities, such as the Newman<br />\nHouse or the Sunday Experiences. Others<br />\norganize their own campus activities,<br />\nsuch as Bible-reading sessions, while a few<br />\nhave little to do with the University and<br />\nonly participate in off-campus<br />\norganizations.

While some people do not look upon them<br />\nwith favor, there can be no doubt that fraternities<br />\nperform a useful service despite their faults. For many<br />\nstudents, fraternities provide a place to live and a place<br />\nto find friends.

Not<br />\nuntil the post-World War II years did the<br />\ngame really begin to capture the<br />\nimagination of middle-class America.<br />\nToday, the game's fans are predominantly<br />\nmiddle and upper class citizens, for the<br />\nprice of a season ticket is prohibitive for<br />\nthe poor or blue collar laborer who wants<br />\nto attend games on a regular basis. It is<br />\nthe relationship between the professional<br />\ngame and its middle class clientel that has<br />\nmade professional football popular, and it<br />\nis this relationship that interests me.<br />\nThe last two decades has seen the flight<br />\nof the white middle class to suburbia.<br />\nThis exodus from the citiesunfortunately<br /><br />\n***<br /><br />\nspectators in the stands. This muting of<br />\nthe appeal to viciousness is deceiving: it<br />\nlets the fan glory in the physical contact<br />\nwithout seeing close at hand the pain that<br />\nis being inflicted upon the athletes in the<br />\n\"pit.\"<br />\nThe territorial aspects of the sport<br />\nsatisfy our historical impulse to expand<br />\nour nation at the expense of others. What<br />\na delightful and simplistic appeal this<br />\nsport makes to this urge - gain enough<br />\nground from the opposition and you<br />\nscore, and eventually you win. Then you<br />\nare truly \"number one.\"<br /><br />\nhas lacked the \"covenant\" necessary to<br />\nbind the disparate suburban elements into<br />\na coherent unity. The sense of<br />\ncommunity which has traditionally been<br />\nthe strength of a city could not be<br />\ndeveloped in suburbia, which by its very<br />\nnature isolates each individual into his<br />\nown separate world. This isolation was<br />\naggravated by the tendency of the<br />\nAmerican family to move around<br />\nconstantly, rarely settling down for an<br />\nappreciable length of time. These factors<br />\ntogether contributed to an unsti,;'ole and<br />\ndeleterious situation.<br /><br />\nroom (impossible) , avoiding collisions<br />\nwith the drunks, watching the fisticuffs<br />\nbehind the end zone as the \"crazies\"<br />\nwould lunge for the ball and the cops<br />\ndeftly plied their nightsticks to preserve<br />\nthe peace; it was the memory of a<br />\nmome'n tious Colt victory (1958'<br />\nChampionship - \"Sudden Death\") and a<br />\nbitter defeat (1965 Western Conference<br />\nPlayoff) , the mythological grandeur of<br />\nthe giant Marchetti, the excellence of<br />\nBerry's finely wrought hands, the flashing<br />\nfeet of Moore(the white wrapped ankles<br />\nmocking the clumsiness of would - be<br />\ntacklers). It was the thrill of the cool man<br />\nfrom the coal mines leading his team to<br />\ncountless last second victories, the<br />\nlumbering gregariousness of \"Big Daddy\"<br />\nLipscomb (and how we mourned when he<br />\ndied that lonely death in Pittsburgh) , or<br />\nthe courage of Orr, the little man's little<br />\nman,<br />\nreturning from the hospital to catch<br />\nstation., 1 he pacing and editing of this<br />\nthe winning T.D. pass; and the common<br />\nsequence, with its several bits of<br />\ngoal, always hoped for, little realized, of<br />\nsimultaneous activity all leading up to a<br />\ngoing all the way<br />\n\"for Baltimore, for<br />\nfew joygful moments of explosive music,<br />\nMaryland, for Victory.\"<br />\nare every bit as impressive technically as<br />\nRah!!

By this,<br />\nI mean the sharing of common<br />\nexperiences, the memory of great<br />\ntraditions, the need for mutual interests<br />\nand goals. All these were part of the<br />\nattraction of going out to the Stadium<br />\nyear after year to see a simple game<br />\nplayed again and again.<br />\nIt meant many, many things<br />\nFor Baltimore, it was the shared<br />\nexperience of finding a parking space<br />\n(difficult) , fighting your way to a rest<br /><br />\nft<br /><br />\nBy MARK CRISPIN MILLER<br />\nJohn Boorman's movie of James<br />\nDickey's gripping, stupid best-seller<br />\nDeliverance is playing at the Cinema<br />\n($2.50) in Washington, and is well worth<br />\nthe price and drive. Although Dickey<br />\nwrote the screenplay, the movie and the<br />\nnovel stand opposed, and it is the movie<br />\nthat will survive (to put it in Dickey's<br />\nterms). Director Boorman brings to poet<br />\nDickey's loud and hollow celebration of<br />\nself-discovery a blend of humaneness and<br />\ncommon sense that would have<br />\nbenefitted the book, and that makes the<br />\nfilm a masterpiece.<br />\nDickey's fierce wilderness and the<br />\nterrible things that happen there give the<br />\nnarrator, Ed Gentry, a new awareness:<br />\nthey \"deliver\" him. Boorman contradicts<br />\neverything Dickey says. His four<br />\nprotagonists should never have gone on<br />\ntheir trip down the river. The film's title<br />\nis a complete irony. The film's wilderness<br />\nis not splendid or exotic, but a hazy,<br />\ndusty, monochromatic green-brown, full<br /><br />\nof menacing shapes and unsettling,<br />\noverloud birdcalls. It contains within<br />\nitself no necessary secrets Its river may<br />\nbe harsh, its sun merciless, but it's really<br />\nnothing more than a place where men can<br />\ncome and prey on each other.<br />\nThe real terror is not in the woods or<br />\nwater, but in men; and the real secret is<br />\nthat something evil lives in men: bobby, a<br />\nroly-poly gladhand fool who can't say<br />\nanything that isn't bawdy, is buggered by<br />\na mountain man in the film's central<br />\nscene. I say \"central\" because everything<br />\nthe protagonists do somehow refers to<br />\nthis harrowing sequence. The wilderness<br />\nis an unsupervised playground where<br />\nvicious little boys can play out their<br />\nphallic malice. Bobby's buggering is the<br />\nfilm's most blatant expression of the<br />\nsame senseless machismo that dominates<br />\nthis world of males. Ed's and Lewis'<br />\narrows, the mountain man's shotguns,<br />\nBobby's mindless attempt on his<br />\nattacker's arrow-skewered corpse: these<br />\nall signify a sickness in men that Dickey<br /><br />\nsees as somehow vital to the soul. We put<br />\ndown the novel and remember the river.<br />\nWe think back on the movie, and those<br />\ncorpses hidden in the river dominate our<br />\nremembrance as they will dominate Ed's<br />\nfor all time, even as he lies in the arms of<br />\nhis wife.<br />\nHere is the only decency in this<br />\nmovie's grotesque world, among the<br />\nvarious women at the end. One of the<br />\nwomen at the boarding-house table<br />\ndescribes an enormous cucumber, reciting<br />\nits measurements with a slow twang. Is<br />\nshe dull? Of course. But in her mild<br />\nsurprise at the cucumber's size there is<br />\nrefreshing mockery of that meaningless<br />\nobsession with male genitals that seems<br />\nto have driven all menfolk completely<br />\ncrazy.<br />\nBoorman's outdoorsy Lewis (Burt<br />\nReynolds) is somewhat like Dickey's glib<br />\nand shallow character. \"The machines are<br />\ngonna fail,\" he says matter-of=factly,<br />\nstringing an elaborate, gadget-studded<br />\nbow and wearing a huge and intricate<br /><br />\nsportsman's wristwatch. But there's also a<br />\ntwisted aspect to Lewis' character that<br />\nwe never find in the novel: he looks<br />\nlongingly at Ed (Jon Voigt)in the light of<br />\nthe campfire, and whimpers in his sleep.<br />\nJon Voigt's Ed is a terrified, unwilling<br />\nfighter. He never revels in mere sensation<br />\nor examines the act of murder like a<br />\ncurious aesthete. While the novel's Ed<br />\nsuggests that he is a more complete<br />\nperson for having the river within him,<br />\nthe movie's Ed is only scared and guilty<br />\nfor having become another killer in the<br />\nragged wilderness.<br />\nOnly a single disappointment<br />\nThe movie is shot with exquisite<br />\nsubtlety and unobtrusive imagination,<br />\nespecially in light of the obvious<br />\ndifficulties entailed in shooting lucid<br />\nsequences on a raging river.

But this is old<br />\nhome week with smiling Jack<br />\nMann having displayed his wares<br />\nwith the Houston Rockets<br />\nTuesday night, and now tonight,<br />\nMr. Bullet, Baltimore's legendary<br />\n\"Honeycomb,\" Gus Johnson, is<br />\ncoming back to where it all<br />\nbegan.<br />\nIt came as a shock to some<br />\nwhen Johnson was finally dealt<br />\naway for a mere draft choice<br />\nfollowing the Bullet's losing<br />\neffort in the playoffs last year.<br />\nYet there were signs that the<br />\ninjury prone 6'6\" acrobat was<br />\nnearing the end of the line<br />\ndespite occasional flashes of<br />\ngreatness. Still a great many fans<br />\nthought that pride would carry<br />\nthe old legs beyond the limits<br />\nthat pain would endure, and even<br />\nin an impossible conflict with the<br />\npowerful New York<br />\nKnickerbockers, Johnson would<br />\npull the team through. Perhaps<br />\nhe would have, if only someone<br />\nhad turned the clock back ten<br />\nyears.<br />\nAt that time, the San<br />\nFrancisco Warriors had the 1963<br />\ndraft all figured out. They were<br /><br />\nbasing their entire system on the<br />\nselection of a \"sleeper\", an<br />\nunknown entity from the<br />\nUniversity of Idaho that no one<br />\nelse could possibly have known<br />\nabout. Still the Warriors sweated<br />\nas team after team made their<br />\nselection until .the new Baltimore<br />\nfranchise was left. \"Baltimore<br />\nchooses Gus Johnson of Idaho,\"<br />\nthe voice on the telehpone<br />\nboomed, and the entire San<br />\nFrancisco draft was ruined.<br />\nHowever, despite an amazing<br />\ndebut, Johnson never got the<br />\npress that was his due. As a<br />\nrookie, he outplayed Jerry Lucas<br />\nin the All-Star game while Lucas<br />\ngot the M.V.P. He was three<br />\ntimes an All-Pro, five times an<br />\nA..-Star, and there are quite a<br />\nfew basketball buffs who felt he<br />\nwas slighted in both these<br />\ncategories. What Baltimore fans<br />\nreally didn't realize, is that<br />\nduring those early lean years, the<br />\nfranchise remained in Baltimore<br />\nonly because of one man, Gus<br />\nJohnson. Without Johnson to<br />\ndraw them in, basketball would<br />\nhave closed up in this city, a lot<br />\nearlier than next year's scheduled<br />\nfarewell date.<br />\nAll those years \"Number 25\"<br />\nwas the best forward in<br />\nbasketball.
