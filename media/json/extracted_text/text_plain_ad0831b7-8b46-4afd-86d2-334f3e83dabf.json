After an exchange of<br />\npunts, the Blue Jays advanced to the<br />\nWashington 30-yard line, but lost the<br />\nball on downs. Huffman, fullback,<br />\nand Berry hit the line for a first<br />\ndown. A fumble in midfield halted<br />\nthe invaders' drive. The 'Shoremen<br />\nadvanced to the Jay 25-yard stripe<br />\non a long pass to Bilancioni, right<br />\nend.<br />\nEarly in the second period, the Jays<br />\nrecovered a Washington fumble and<br />\npushed their way to the 'Shoremen's<br />\n15-yard line. McClean tossed to Kelly<br />\nfor 20 yards, but his subsequent passes over the goal line were batted<br />\ndown by the Washington secondary.<br />\nBerry and Huffman did the bulk of<br />\nthe work as the 'Shoremen put on an<br />\noffensive which carried them to the<br />\nJay 23-yard line before the quarter<br />\nended.<br /><br />\n\u2014Courtesy Sun papers<br /><br />\nPETE REYNOLDS<br /><br />\nBerry received the Jay kick-off on<br />\nthe 20 and ran to the 45-yard line,<br />\nwhere he was forced out of bounds.<br />\nUnable<br /><br />\nto<br /><br />\nadvance,<br /><br />\nWashington<br /><br />\npunted. Here the Jays put on a sustained drive which brought them to<br />\nthe visitors' 16-yard stripe. Washington kicked to the 40-yard line, but<br />\nGraziano, left halfback, sprinted to<br />\nthe 18-yard line before being brought<br />\ndown. A Jay attempt to score via the<br />\nair was again frustrated by the<br />\ndefense. Again<br />\nthe<br />\nWashington<br />\n'Shoremen punted, and runs by Reynolds and McClean carried the Jays<br />\nto the visitors' 10-yard line.<br />\n'Jays Attack In Vain<br />\nOn the first play in the fourth quarter, McClean passed to Reynolds over<br />\nthe goal line, but Young intercepted<br />\nthe heave and made his 101-yard run<br />\nfor the first tally. Dwyer, right tackle, missed his try for the extra point<br />\nThe Jays threatened anew late in the<br />\ntussle, but again an aerial effort resulted in an intercepted pass and a<br />\nWashington touchdown. Young converted from placement.<br />\nThe contest marked the return of<br />\nPete Reynolds, veteran fleet-footed<br />\nback, to the Jay fold.<br /><br />\nIn an attempt to improve swimming at Hopkins and to produce a<br />\nbetter grade of varsity competition,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University has<br />\nannounced plans for securing the<br />\nBaltimore City College pool for practice sessions. While the natatorium<br />\nhas not been definitely obtained as<br />\nyet, Coach Hambleton stated that<br />\nthere is a good chance for securing<br />\nit on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons.<br />\nWith this added advantage the<br />\nteam should have an even better year<br />\nthan in 1933-34, when it enjoyed a<br />\nvery successful season, marked by<br />\nthe establishing of several new J.<br />\nH. U. records.<br />\nAmong the record-breakers last<br />\nyear was Eddie Sadtler, captain of<br />\nthe 1933-34 aggregation, who lowered the 200-yard breaststroke mark.<br />\nSadtler is lost to the team through<br />\ngraduation, but his shoes will be capably filled by Bill Hazlett, who<br />\ntrailed closely behind Eddie in all<br />\ntheir races.<br />\nLou Adler, another junior, cracked<br />\nthe 440-yard mark last year and expects to better his time this season.<br />\nPerhaps the most outstanding veteran from the previous season, however, is Woody White, captain of the<br />\nteam this year. White, whose specialty is the 100-yard swim, tied the<br />\nrecord in that event and won most<br />\nof his races in 1934.<br />\nDan Weiner, Ed Scheer, Bud Adler,<br />\nand Bill Koenig are for members of<br />\nlast year's freshman squad who are<br />\nexpected to bolster the team greatly.<br />\nWeiner, while a freshman, broke the<br />\nrecord for the 100-yard backstroke<br />\nin a frosh meet against the Y. M. C.<br />\nA. last year.<br /><br />\nBoth athletics and activities have<br />\nserved as fields of endeavor at the<br />\nHopkins for Charlie Orth. Charles<br />\nbegan his athletic career at Friends<br />\nSchool where he completed his primary and secondary education. There<br />\nhe played football and lacrosse and<br />\nwas outstanding in both of these<br />\nsports.<br />\nExtremely exceptional was the fact<br />\nthat he attained a varsity berth on<br />\nFriends lacrosse team when only in<br />\nthe sixth grade. Equally proficient<br />\nin football and swimming he obtained<br />\nmajor letters in these sports in his<br />\nsecond year.<br />\nFootball Mainstay<br />\nCharlie continued his fine athletic<br />\nshowing when he entered the Hopkins, making the football team as<br />\ntackle in his sophomore year, and the<br />\nlacrosse team as inhome in his junior year.<br />\nThis season he has been one of the<br />\nmainstays of the forward line of the<br />\nfootball eleven.<br />\nLast year Orth was elected to Omicron Delta Kappa and also was honored with selection for Scabbard and<br />\nBlade, honorary R. 0.
