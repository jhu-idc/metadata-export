While it<br />\nhas not been proven just exactly why, when, or how, the<br />\nchairs and tables in the Rathskellar were appropriated, it is<br />\nsafe to assume that the more minor thefts, such as those of<br />\nthe beer mugs and pitchers arc largely the responsibility of<br />\nundergraduates. And though the Hopkins Union is for the<br />\nentire University, practically speaking it is primarily for the<br />\nundergraduate: any thefts or defacement of the Union are<br />\nbasically a blow against an undergraduate facility. Should<br />\nstudents continue to act irresponsibly by taking University<br />\nproperty, University officials will have no other ch9icc than<br />\nto post a heavy security buard near the Rathskellar, or revert<br />\nback to benches in the Union dining facilities. Neither<br />\nprospect is a pleasant one. Students who do steal from the<br />\nUnion exhibit a self-centeredness which, many people cit as a<br />\ntrademark of the Hopkins undergraduate.<br />\nAs is the case in most such incidents of theft, it only takes<br />\na few to hurt. many. What people can do, first of all, is<br />\nencourage people with stolen goods, including mugs, to<br />\nreturn t-hem. Secondly, people should realize that small<br />\nitems, such as mugs, do add up in the long run, and such<br />\nadded expenses to the Union dining operation can only serve<br />\nto abet an increase in food prices. Third, students must try to<br />\nprevent- further stealinng by applying friendly coercion to<br />\npeople who have the inclination to simply walk off with<br />\nthings, or if necessary. simply report people who steal. It is<br />\ntime that students here took the responsibility of not only<br />\nlooking out for themselves, but looking out for the general<br />\nwelfare of the community as well. This has always been<br />\nnecessary in a viable free community, and in this case, is the<br />\nsimplest solution to insure that the Rathskellar and the<br />\nUnion remain in quality condition so that they may function<br />\nproperly.<br />\n<br />\nBy JOHN SRYGLEY<br />\nAfter a summer of almost<br />\nunendurable prostitution in an air<br />\nconditioning factory along with<br />\nthe rest of my fellow part-time<br />\nproletariats, and several of the<br />\ncustomary pitched battles in the<br />\nstruggle for power at home, I've<br />\nreturned to the Homewood<br />\nsanctuary not a little bit wiser, and<br />\nfull of speculation on last year's<br />\nrhytmic. coup d'etat.

In comparison, I<br />\ndo not see many differences<br />\nbetween the two publications,<br />\nboth in content and style. As an<br />\nincoming freshman, I read the<br />\nHandbook and found it amusing<br />\nand informative. The '73<br />\nHandbook seemed to be in much<br />\nthe same light vein. I laughed at<br />\nthe obvious humor and at a few<br />\ninside jokes, too. This year, the<br />\nnew version seemed to contain<br />\nnothing avant-garde or offensive in<br />\nthe way of humor and format.<br />\nTrue, the size and shape are<br />\ndifferent, but I cannot agree with<br />\nthe somewhat lame attitude taken<br />\nby the administrators. This is the<br />\nfirst year I could have as many<br />\nHandbooks as I wanted without<br />\npaying 75 cents apiece. And if I<br />\nlost it while carrying it around<br />\ndifficulty<br />\nI could get<br />\nwith<br />\nanother free. In other words, I<br />\nthink people would carry it around<br />\nmore since it wouldn't cost more<br />\nmoney to get a new one.<br />\nincidentally. I like the new paper<br />\nidea better than the ho,k, whh -li I<br />\nalways felt belonged on my<br />\n<br />\nbookshelf. The paper fits right into<br />\nthe books I'm carrying, my purse<br />\nor my back pocket. But size and<br />\nshape aside, doe.s the new<br />\nHandpaper do its job? What is the<br />\njob of any handbook/paper? Since<br />\nthe catalogue is the slick,<br />\nstreamlined factual history that the<br />\nadmissions office can distribute to<br />\nsnap up prospective students, the<br />\nhandbook doesn't need any of<br />\nthat. Since it's supposed to be a<br />\nguide to campus activities, it need<br />\nnot be filled with pictures of snow<br />\nor magnolias to impress parents or<br />\nalumni. Most of all, it shouldn't be<br />\na cut and dryed 9-5 feeling of<br />\nHopkins. The handbook should<br />\nprovide an idea of college<br />\nlife-social, dorm and night. It<br />\nshould be anything but a beef<br />\njerky impression, as the Dean<br />\nhopes to present. I think the<br />\nhandpaper should show you how<br />\nto take it all in your stride, how t,<br />\ntake the ups and downs, how to<br />\nget the best or the worst out of<br />\nany situation, and best of all, what<br />\nto expect and reap from Baltimore<br />\nas a city.

While it<br />\nhas not been proven just exactly why, when, or how, the<br />\nchairs and tables in the Rathskellar were appropriated, it is<br />\nsafe to assume that the more minor thefts, such as those of<br />\nthe beer mugs and pitchers arc largely the responsibility of<br />\nundergraduates. And though the Hopkins Union is for the<br />\nentire University, practically speaking it is primarily for the<br />\nundergraduate: any thefts or defacement of the Union are<br />\nbasically a blow against an undergraduate facility. Should<br />\nstudents continue to act irresponsibly by taking University<br />\nproperty, University officials will have no other ch9icc than<br />\nto post a heavy security buard near the Rathskellar, or revert<br />\nback to benches in the Union dining facilities. Neither<br />\nprospect is a pleasant one. Students who do steal from the<br />\nUnion exhibit a self-centeredness which, many people cit as a<br />\ntrademark of the Hopkins undergraduate.<br />\nAs is the case in most such incidents of theft, it only takes<br />\na few to hurt. many. What people can do, first of all, is<br />\nencourage people with stolen goods, including mugs, to<br />\nreturn t-hem. Secondly, people should realize that small<br />\nitems, such as mugs, do add up in the long run, and such<br />\nadded expenses to the Union dining operation can only serve<br />\nto abet an increase in food prices. Third, students must try to<br />\nprevent- further stealinng by applying friendly coercion to<br />\npeople who have the inclination to simply walk off with<br />\nthings, or if necessary. simply report people who steal. It is<br />\ntime that students here took the responsibility of not only<br />\nlooking out for themselves, but looking out for the general<br />\nwelfare of the community as well. This has always been<br />\nnecessary in a viable free community, and in this case, is the<br />\nsimplest solution to insure that the Rathskellar and the<br />\nUnion remain in quality condition so that they may function<br />\nproperly.<br /><br />\nBy JOHN SRYGLEY<br />\nAfter a summer of almost<br />\nunendurable prostitution in an air<br />\nconditioning factory along with<br />\nthe rest of my fellow part-time<br />\nproletariats, and several of the<br />\ncustomary pitched battles in the<br />\nstruggle for power at home, I've<br />\nreturned to the Homewood<br />\nsanctuary not a little bit wiser, and<br />\nfull of speculation on last year's<br />\nrhytmic. coup d'etat.

In comparison, I<br />\ndo not see many differences<br />\nbetween the two publications,<br />\nboth in content and style. As an<br />\nincoming freshman, I read the<br />\nHandbook and found it amusing<br />\nand informative. The '73<br />\nHandbook seemed to be in much<br />\nthe same light vein. I laughed at<br />\nthe obvious humor and at a few<br />\ninside jokes, too. This year, the<br />\nnew version seemed to contain<br />\nnothing avant-garde or offensive in<br />\nthe way of humor and format.<br />\nTrue, the size and shape are<br />\ndifferent, but I cannot agree with<br />\nthe somewhat lame attitude taken<br />\nby the administrators. This is the<br />\nfirst year I could have as many<br />\nHandbooks as I wanted without<br />\npaying 75 cents apiece. And if I<br />\nlost it while carrying it around<br />\ndifficulty<br />\nI could get<br />\nwith<br />\nanother free. In other words, I<br />\nthink people would carry it around<br />\nmore since it wouldn't cost more<br />\nmoney to get a new one.<br />\nincidentally. I like the new paper<br />\nidea better than the ho,k, whh -li I<br />\nalways felt belonged on my<br /><br />\nbookshelf. The paper fits right into<br />\nthe books I'm carrying, my purse<br />\nor my back pocket. But size and<br />\nshape aside, doe.s the new<br />\nHandpaper do its job? What is the<br />\njob of any handbook/paper? Since<br />\nthe catalogue is the slick,<br />\nstreamlined factual history that the<br />\nadmissions office can distribute to<br />\nsnap up prospective students, the<br />\nhandbook doesn't need any of<br />\nthat. Since it's supposed to be a<br />\nguide to campus activities, it need<br />\nnot be filled with pictures of snow<br />\nor magnolias to impress parents or<br />\nalumni. Most of all, it shouldn't be<br />\na cut and dryed 9-5 feeling of<br />\nHopkins. The handbook should<br />\nprovide an idea of college<br />\nlife-social, dorm and night. It<br />\nshould be anything but a beef<br />\njerky impression, as the Dean<br />\nhopes to present. I think the<br />\nhandpaper should show you how<br />\nto take it all in your stride, how t,<br />\ntake the ups and downs, how to<br />\nget the best or the worst out of<br />\nany situation, and best of all, what<br />\nto expect and reap from Baltimore<br />\nas a city. In my opinion our<br />\npresent handpaper has done its job<br />\nwell.<br />\n\u20221 Moreno<br />\nClass 1976<br /><br />\nof mankind with a history that<br />\ndisappears in primeval mists.\"<br />\nJung didn't exactly have the<br />\nfreshman class in mind when he<br />\nwrote the preceeding sentence, and<br />\nI must admit that these five<br />\nhundred starry eyed, lackadaisical<br />\nfreshman don't have much in<br />\ncommon, with Jung's metaphorical<br />\n'modern man' but there is one<br />\nthing that everyone has to be glad<br />\nabout, that \"every step<br />\nforward means an act of tearing<br />\nhimself loose from that all<br />\nembracing pristine unconsciousness which claims the<br />\nbulk of mankind.\"<br />\nAs a member in good standing<br />\nof the UAW, and a veteran<br />\ni-don't-know-nothing factory<br />\nworker specializing in such things<br />\nas screwing this screw here, and<br />\nplacing this rubber padding there,<br />\nthere is very little that I wouldn't<br />\nbe able to tell you about that very<br />\nlarge portion of mankind which<br />\nhas never emerged from mentally<br />\nsterile unconsciousness.
