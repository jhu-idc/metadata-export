Koka, the<br />\ngeneral secretary of the Black<br />\nAllied Workers Union, and an<br />\nindicted co-conspirator in the<br />\ntrial of the II Soweto student<br />\nleaders is currently touring the<br />\nUnited States after escaping<br />\narrest for his part in the 1976<br />\nSoweto Rebellion.<br />\nKoka began his address by<br />\ndescribing the living conditions<br />\nof blacks, in South Africa.<br />\nStressing that he spoke from<br />\npersonal experience, not<br />\nacademic research, he recounted<br />\nthe racial inequalities prevalent in<br />\nhis country. South Africa's<br />\npopulation. is 26 million. Only<br />\nfour million are whites, yet they<br />\nown 87% of the land, squeezing<br />\nthe 20 million blacks onto the<br />\nremaining 13%. Blacks must live<br />\nin all -black areas called<br />\n\"homelands\" unless they have<br />\npermission to work in the cities.<br />\nConsequently, :unemployment<br />\nranks as a major problem for<br />\nblacks, with lack of training and<br />\nthe inability of live in urban areas<br />\npreventing blacks from getting<br />\ndecent jobs.<br />\nKoka explained that, contrary<br />\nto popular opinion, the presence<br />\nof foreign corporations in South<br />\nAfrica does not improve blacks'<br />\nemployment chances. Because of<br />\na governmentally-imposed quota<br />\nsystem, employers can hire only<br />\na limited number of blacks. Thus<br />\nthe \"black man is not profiting<br />\nin any way by the presence of<br />\n<br />\nread \"UC Invests in Death.\" It<br />\nfluttered, briefly, at the top of<br />\nthe highest flagpole on the<br />\nUniversity of California-Berkeley<br />\ncampus one morning late last<br />\nmonth, until the school hired a<br />\nclimber to remove it.

New York papers,<br />\nespecially the New York Times<br />\nBook Review, have traditionally<br />\nbeen where most publishers<br />\npromote their new books. Since<br />\nthe strike has continued through<br />\nthe publishers' prime fall selling<br />\nseason, the publishers are<br />\nworried. But the newsletter<br />\nfound the \"big books by name<br />\nauthors are le3s likely to be hurt<br />\nby the strike than first novels<br />\nby unknown authors.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThus new books by established<br />\nauthors like Mario Puzo, James<br />\nMichener, Theodore White and<br />\nBarbara Tuchman are selling well<br />\nin New York in spite of the<br />\nstrike. But Lynn Bond of Barnes<br />\n& Noble Bookstores told BP<br />\nReport that the strike has made<br />\nit hard to sell first-time authors'<br />\nworks.<br />\nHelp may be on the way. To<br />\n<br />\ntake up the advertising slack<br />\ncreated by the strike, periodicals<br />\nlike Time, the New Republic,<br />\nNewsweek, New Yorker,I and even<br />\nSports Illustrated are printed<br />\nexpanded or newly-created book<br />\nsections.<br />\n<br />\none on California campuses,<br />\nwhere in the past two years<br />\nrecord numbers of demonstrators<br />\nprotested investments in South<br />\nAfrica. But as the students<br />\nreturned, so did divestiture<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThe flagpole banner was the<br />\nfirst sign of a regenerated<br />\ndivestiture movement. A<br />\nspokesman for BAFFL(Bay Area<br />\nFree Levitator) said the ascent of<br />\nthe 100-foot flagpole was<br />\n\"in<br />\norder to dramatize<br />\nthis<br />\nuniversity's involvement with a<br />\nracist, apartheid nation which has<br />\nshown utmost disregard for the<br />\nrights and lives of the majority of<br />\nits citizens.\" The spokesperson<br />\npromised more messages.<br />\nThen, also at Berkeley, the UC<br />\nAssociated Student Senate voted<br />\nat its first meeting to stop<br />\nstocking the AS jewelry store<br />\nwith gold and diamonds from<br />\nSouth Africa.<br />\nWhile the new policy will allow<br />\nselling of jewelry already on the<br />\nshelves, it requires posting of<br />\nsigns at the store's entrance<br />\nwarning that by buying gold and<br />\ndiamonds there they may be<br />\nsupporting South Africa's<br />\noppressive regime.<br />\nDon Davis of Students for<br />\nEconomic and Racial Justice<br />\n(SERJ) testified at the meeting<br />\nthat the AS action was consistent<br />\nwith referenda showing a<br />\ncont. to p. 8<br />\n<br />\nBlack Frat Formed;<br />\nService Is Stressed<br />\nPhi Beta Sigma, the new black<br />\nservice fraternity at Hopkins, is<br />\ntrying to make the students nere<br />\naware of its existence.

After a<br />\nwoman burned herself up rather than leave the apartment in<br />\nwhich she had been barricaded for years, Heiss slowly went<br />\noff the deep end. He was quietly replaced, and was last seen<br />\ndriving a cab somewhere in West Baltimore. His successor,<br />\nLarry Frelow, was one of the few University employees<br />\nactually fired for incompetence, in the middle of the year,<br />\nno less. His assistant, Umran Uras, was given the job as a<br />\nstopgap, a makeshift solution which slowly developed into a<br />\npermanent one.

Snould someone within the University<br />\nhappen to be the most competent person available to fill<br />\nUmran's spot, fine.

Pfeffer<br />\nwas trying to warn the graduating<br />\nstudents against allowing<br />\nthemselves to become so many<br />\nmore absorbed elements of \"the<br />\nsystem\" (a difficult thing to do,<br />\nfor it is this pathway that usually<br />\nleads to greatest economic and<br />\nsocial status). Instead, everyone<br />\nshould look objectively at this<br />\nsystem, and try to change what<br />\nhe understands to be wrong. We<br />\nare the persons who will make<br />\nuseful changes in the future, if<br />\nwe recognize our responsibility<br />\nto do so.<br />\nYour editorial calls Pfeffer's<br />\nviews \"an intellectual crock,\"<br />\nthen proceeds to criticize small\"<br />\nsegments of the speech, with no<br />\nreference to the context in which<br />\nthe ideas were used. The issue<br />\nwas not whether chemical food<br />\nadditives are \"healthy\"--every<br />\nyear there is more evidence<br />\nagainst their use, and we have<br />\nonly begun to research their ill<br />\neffects--it was that the need for<br />\nsuch adulteration of food comes<br />\nfrom the need for more profits.<br />\nPfeffer used this point as one of<br />\nhis many valid criticisms of<br />\ncapitalist society. (I would<br />\nassume that the Belgian food<br />\nindustry is making a determined<br />\neffort to have any additive bans<br />\nrepealed).<br />\nThe editorial demonstrated<br />\none of Pfeffer's statements: we<br />\nare made to feel \"...that it is<br />\nnaive and utopian, if not actually<br />\nsubversive, to even think that<br />\nthere might .be a much better<br />\nway to organize our lives.\" We<br />\nshould not be content with our<br />\nlot merely because, relative to<br />\nother nations or to the past, it ie<br />\n\"the best.\" (\"Our candles bun<br />\nbrighter than everyone else's so<br />\nwhy bother thinking about<br />\nelectric lights?':) Complacency<br />\ncan lead only to stagnation.<br />\nThe editorial entitled \"Red<br />\nThere may not be a war in<br />\nRick's Report\" (Oct. 20) is a Vietnam or a Nixon in the White<br />\ndisgrace.

Why are the<br />\nSoviet Union and Marxism<br />\nimmediately mentioned<br />\nwhenever someone criticizes the<br />\nU.S. or proposes radical change?<br />\nI did not see the words<br />\n\"Marxism\" or \"Marxist\" in the<br />\ntext of the speech. While<br />\nPfeffer's ideas are certainly<br />\ncompatible v, ith Marxist<br />\nphilosophy, they are common to<br />\nmany other progressive<br />\nsocial/economic ideologies as<br />\nwell. There are other alternatives<br />\nto capitalism. (By the way,<br />\nMarxism is not \"a rigid,<br />\ndeterministic dogma\" unless one<br />\nmisinterprets it. The Soviet<br />\nUnion has horribly distorted<br />\nMarxist government).<br />\nIn conclusion, I would<br />\nrecommend a thorough<br />\nreexamination of Pfeffer's speech<br />\nfrom a less paranoiac point of<br />\nview. His dream of a government<br />\ndesigned to satisfy meaningful<br />\nhuman needs and in which<br />\nappearance and reality are the<br />\nsame is one shared, by persons<br />\nranging from Buckminster Fuller<br />\nto Timothy Leary to I.F. Stone.<br />\nIf your editorial truly reflects the<br />\nstudent attitudes toward this<br />\nideal, then we are in serious<br />\ntrouble.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nMark D. Skoner<br />\n<br />\nwhich, in itself, is undeniably<br />\ncommendable when one<br />\nconsiders the evident injustices<br />\npresent in our society.<br />\nHis attitude is one that at least<br />\nlooks toward the future, and this<br />\nprogressive view is much more<br />\ndesirable than the reactionary<br />\none expressed by the editor, who<br />\nfails to look beyond his own<br />\nnarrow cultural conception. What<br />\ndoes the editor mean by stating<br />\nthat Westerners \"live the longest,<br />\nhealthiest lives in human<br />\nhistory.\" To suggests that this is<br />\ngrounds for complacency is quite<br />\nludicrous. If, indeed, the editor's<br />\nwords have any real meaning,<br />\nthen this would seem to be the<br />\n\"logical\" inference. The<br />\ndiscussion of freedom of thought<br />\nin the universities is,<br />\nfurthermore, certainly ironic<br />\nwhen one considers the outcome<br />\nof the Pfeffer tenure decision.<br />\nThe really sad thing about this<br />\neditorial is not that it expresses<br />\nan opinion (to which I would not<br />\nobject), but that it purports to<br />\nrefute a complex intellectual<br />\nposition with a snap of the<br />\nfingers. Despite the protestations<br />\nof enlightened thinking, the<br />\neditor truly has much in common<br />\nwith stereotypical \"sixteenth<br />\ncentury peasants.\" In the future<br />\nthe editor should remember his<br />\nobligation, financial and<br />\notherwise, to the University and,<br />\nhence, the student body. Perhaps<br />\nthen we will see the end of such<br />\nirresponsible demagoguery.<br />\nHoward Kaplan<br />\n<br />\nLow Blow<br />\n<br />\nLuce Disputed<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to respond to the<br />\nOct. 20 editorial, \"Red Rick's<br />\n:sic) Report.\" This is not a<br />\nlefense of Dr. Pfeffer's position,<br />\nbut an examination of the<br />\nexquisitely intelligent and<br />\nopen-minded comments of the<br />\nNews-Letter editor. Admittedly I<br />\nhave learned not to expect much<br />\nfrom this paper's editorials, but<br />\non the other hand, this one is too<br />\nmuqi to passively accept. The<br />\neditorial, more than any other<br />\nsection of the paper, must<br />\ndemonstrate responsible and<br />\njudicious thinking, since it is the<br />\nprinciple mode by which the<br />\nNews-Letter should attempt to<br />\ninfluence the opinion of the<br />\ncommunity. The shoddy<br />\nreasonings and half-baked<br />\nconclusions of the Pfeffer<br />\neditorial demonstrate the editor's<br />\nfailure to live up to his<br />\nfundamental obligations.<br />\nI am hardly a confirmed<br />\nMarxist, but to assert<br />\ncategorically that their views are<br />\n\"wild and patently implausible\"<br />\nindicates that, in this instance,<br />\nthe ecii.or ;mows liist-hand more<br />\nabout \"intellectual crock\" than<br />\nhe lets on. The main thrust of the<br />\neditor's argument seems to be:<br />\n\"Why be critical of our present<br />\nsociety when it is no worse than<br />\nany other past or present?\" This<br />\ncertainly misses the whole point.<br />\nHoy/ever dubious .are his<br />\nmotivations, Dr. Pfeffer is<br />\nconcerned with outlining a<br />\nsocietal critique- an ambition<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nMr. Luce's criticisms of<br />\ngovernment functioning and<br />\nlabor conditions. Although the<br />\naverage age of government<br />\nofficials and representatives is<br />\nolder compared to that of the<br />\nUnited States, we, as citizens of<br />\n\u2022 the Republic of China, do not see<br />\nany wrong with that as long as<br />\nthey serve the people well.<br />\nFurther, the government has<br />\nundertaken a series of steps of<br />\nreorganization. For instance,<br />\nmore new representatives<br />\nreplacing older ones have been<br />\nelected, and more younger<br />\nofficials recruited into key<br />\noffices. Also, in our country, it is<br />\nmandatory for six to fifteen year<br />\nold youngsters to attend school.<br />\nIt is unlikely for those between<br />\nthe ages of \"10 and 14\" to work<br />\nin \"U.S. factories\" shedding their<br />\n\"blood, sweat, and tears\" as Mr.<br />\nLuce suggested. However,<br />\nstudents over 15 in vocational<br />\nprograms can work, but are hired<br />\nonly as work-study students. The<br />\naverage wage for those who work<br />\nwork-study in the U.S. is $75 per<br />\nmonth.<br />\nAs Chinese students in this<br />\nschool, most of whom were born<br />\nand grew up in Taiwan, we are<br />\nmore than happy to share our<br />\nknowledge of life in Taiwan with<br />\nanyone who has further<br />\nquestions.

S. E.<br />\nLibrary, I noticed a fairly large<br />\ncrowd of students gathered<br />\nbefore an unusual-looking tent<br />\non the Green just south of<br />\nRemsen Hall. Some of them were<br />\nseated on the lawn, some<br />\nstanding; all were staring at the<br />\nstrange-looking tent, and all were<br />\nsmiling or laughing. Pondering<br />\nwhat might be going on, I<br />\nstrolled across the Green until I<br />\nwas behind the gathered<br />\nstudents. Then, with a surge of<br />\ndelight and surprise, I realized<br />\nwhat an unusual phenomenon<br />\nwas taking place: There, on<br />\nGilman Green, in the shadow of<br />\naugust and dignified Remsen Hall<br />\nwas a real and genuine Punch<br />\nand Judy Show!<br />\nThe tent was beautifully<br />\ngotten up; the character of Mr.<br />\nPunch was splendidly and<br />\nauthentically represented, large<br />\ncont. on p. 8<br />\n<br />\nAssociate Dean of Homewood<br />\nFacilities Jakie Hall, or any<br />\nsurrogate whom Hall appoints.<br />\nThe major concern of the<br />\nmembers of the administration is<br />\nto keep the legal process as<br />\nsimple as possible.

Neither the<br />\ncouncil nor the Adminstration<br />\nexpect that the code will be used<br />\nvery often.<br />\nOnce the Council composes a<br />\nfinal draft, members of the<br />\ncentral administration will<br />\nexamine its provisions. The code<br />\nwill then be submitted to the<br />\nstudents for a referendum. After<br />\nthat, the Board of Trustees will<br />\nhave to ratify it.

This second part shows<br />\nthe McCarthy of the 1968, anti-Vietnam campaign, and<br />\nthis is what makes the book extraordinary.<br />\nHere are some of McCarthy's solutions to current<br />\nproblems:<br />\nIndians: Unlike during the period of Manifest Destiny,<br />\n\"there is time, and there is more space available to Indians<br />\nthan we have come lo believe. There is, if accepted, a<br />\nplace in America for cultural differences, certainly to the<br />\nd extent that they are being sought by the Indian<br />\nes of America. We must not expect the return of the<br />\n'noble savage,' but the establishment of conditions which<br />\nallow and encourage Indians to live with<br />\ndignity--conditions of reasonable economic and cultural<br />\nsecurity.\"<br />\nEconomy: Despite the incredible amount of conspicuous<br />\nconsumption, \"things are not desperate in the United<br />\nStates. The nation still has the potential to meet its<br />\neconomic needs. What is called for is<br />\nre-examination...How far have we gone down the road<br />\ntoward destroying ourselves as civil and social<br />\nbeings?...What is called for is continuing moral response?<br />\nnot one requiring unusual sacrifice of heroic virtues, but<br />\nan acceptance of restraint within reasonable limits, of<br />\nresponsibility toward nature and the resources of the<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nThe Presidency: \"The essential strength of the Presidency<br />\nshould rest in the office itself--not in the person who<br />\noccupies it at a given time...The limits of power should be<br />\ndefined as carefully as possible, and honored in practice.<br />\nWhen unconstitutional use of presidential power is not<br />\nchecked in time, there is clear and demonstrated danger<br />\nthat Congress, in reaction, and sometimes in an effort to<br />\ncover for Congressional neglect and failure, will abuse the<br />\npresidential office and hamper Presidents in the proper<br />\nexercise of their Constitutional powers. Overreactions of<br />\nthis kind, demonstrated in the post-Vietnam and<br />\n<br />\nli<br />\n<br />\n) dim! am) )ww)<br />\n<br />\n)<br />\n<br />\n)<br />\n<br />\npost-Watergate periods, lead not only to unconstitutional<br />\ngovernment, but also to less effective government.\"<br />\nDespite McCarthy's and Toqueville's differences in age,<br />\nnationality, and governmental experience, both authors<br />\nretain a sense of optimism about America and reflect<br />\nAmerica's growth. Toqueville writes about an America<br />\nwhich is still young and largely unexplored, yet he senses<br />\nthe dangers of democracy--citizens relying too heavily<br />\nupon Big Government, freedom of press getting out of<br />\ncontrol, demogoguery, etc. McCarthy describes an older,<br />\nmore tired America, whose citizens take a less active role<br />\nin their government and press, and too often, submit to<br />\nthe stifling hand of corporate and federal bureaucracy.<br />\nYet, McCarthy, too, has faith in American democracy.<br />\nPerhaps there is something in America, itself, that<br />\nsustains individual morality against the equally forceful<br />\ntendency of the citizenry toward self-tyrannization. But<br />\nAmericans would be wise to heed Toqueville's and<br />\nMcCarthy's words. As Toqueville warned, \"No one will<br />\never believe that a liberal, wise, and energetic government<br />\ncan spring from the suffrages of a subservient people.\"<br />\nEugene McCarthy will speak at the MSE Symposium on<br />\n\u2022<br />\nNovember 1 at 4 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nPHOTOGRAPHY<br />\nthe eye we are told<br />\nis a camera<br />\nbut the film is the heart<br />\nnot the brain<br />\nand our hands joining<br />\nthose that reach<br />\ndevelop the product<br />\n<br />\nof winter yet<br />\nthere are those who would have<br />\nno other season<br />\nit's always easy when thinking<br />\nwe have the best to assume<br />\nothers covet it<br />\nyet surf or sea each has<br />\nits lovers and its meaning<br />\nfor love<br />\n<br />\nit's easy sitting in the sun<br />\nto forget that cold exists<br />\nlet alone envelopes<br />\nthe lives of people<br />\nit's easy sitting in the sun<br />\nto forget the ice and ravages<br />\n<br />\nwatching the red sun bleed<br />\ninto the ocean<br />\none thinks of the beauty that fire brings<br />\nif the eye is a camera and the film is the heart<br />\nthen the photo assistant is god<br />\nfrom cotton candy on a rainy day<br />\n<br />\nINNII MO<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSupplies<br />\n<br />\nNikki<br />\nqiovANNi<br />\n<br />\nBooks<br />\n<br />\nWELCOME<br />\nPARENTS<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nmeasure Dome CO Easy & Filling Foods<br />\n<br />\n44<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOMEWOOD<br />\nDELICATESSEN<br />\nJUST ABOVE 31st STREET<br />\n3105 ST PAUL ST<br />\nOpen Daily 9-9<br />\n<br />\n467-7882<br />\n<br />\nOpen Sunday 9-5<br />\n<br />\n\"Baltimore's Best\" BALTIMORE Magazine<br />\n<br />\nThe Bookcenter will<br />\nbe open Saturday,<br />\nOctober 28 from<br />\n9:30 A.M. - 2:00 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nALWAYS<br />\nHOT JUICY CORNED BEEF<br />\nSANDWICHES $ 1.49 EACH<br />\nFRIED CHICKEN PLATTERS<br />\nLEG or BREAST<br />\n$ 1.29<br />\nWITH DELICIOUS WESTERN FRIES<br />\nALWAYS HOT NEW YORK BAGELS<br />\nLOX \u2014 SMOKED FISH,<br />\nSABLE PICKLED HERRING<br />\nMEAT AND POTATO KNISHES<br />\nDELICIOUS FRESHMADE SOUP<br />\nNATURAL FOOD DEPARTMENT<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 20 I OCTOBER 27, 1978<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOffice of Special Events presents<br />\n<br />\nN-L<br />\n<WEDNESDAY-NOON-5ER 1E50, CLASSIFIEDS<br />\n\"THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS:<br />\nLOOKING BACKWARD AND FOWARD<br />\nDa.

MILLER<br />\nFive first-half fumbles and a<br />\nrash of penalties paved the way<br />\nto disaster last Saturday, as the<br />\nundefeated Georgetown<br />\nUniversity football team rolled to<br />\na 42-20 victory over the hapless<br />\nBlue Jays. The loss dropped<br />\nHopkins' record to 2-4, all but<br />\nerasing the Jay' chances for their<br />\nfirst winning season since 1973.<br />\nThe Hoyas wasted little time<br />\n*umping into the lead, as senior<br />\nuarterback Bob Sitz combined<br />\nwith wide receiver Clayton<br />\n'Wagner<br />\non an eight-yard<br />\ntouchdown pass. The score<br />\ncapped a six-play Georgetown<br />\ndrive which began when Blue Jay<br />\nrunning back Matt Martello<br />\nfumbled the ball away at the<br />\nHopkins 36 on the fourth play of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThree plays later Georgetown<br />\nscored again, taking advantage of<br />\na bobbled Blue Jay kickoff<br />\nreturn to set up a 7-yard<br />\ntouchdown run by halfback<br />\nAndy Murray. Kicker Jim<br />\nCorcoran added another extra<br />\npoint, giving the Hoyas a 14-0<br />\nlead only six minutes into the<br />\ncontest.<br />\nOn the next Georgetown<br />\npossession the Blue Jay defense<br />\nheld the Hoyas, as a 37-yard<br />\nCorcoral field goal attempt<br />\nbounced off the uprights to open<br />\nthe second quarter. Hopkins took<br />\npossession at its own 20 yard<br />\nline, but quickly surrendered the<br />\nball a third time when senior<br />\ntri-captain Kenny Bess fumbled<br />\non the first play from scrimmage,<br />\n<br />\nii<br />\n<br />\nFive plays later the I loyas scored<br />\nagain, giving them a 21-0 lead.<br />\nThe Blue Jays lost the ball<br />\nagain on their next possession,<br />\nbut heads-up defensive play by<br />\nlinemen Ned Sacha and Selwin<br />\nalert Hopkins<br />\nVickers and<br />\nsecondary forced the Hoyas to<br />\npunt the ball away for the first<br />\ntime in the contest.<br />\nOn the first play of the series<br />\nthat followed burly Blue Jay<br />\nrunning back Kenny Bess burst<br />\nthrough a wall of blockers and<br />\nraced 58 yards to the Hoya three<br />\nbefore being knocked out of<br />\nbounds. But once more Blue Jay<br />\nexecution broke down, as<br />\nHopkins lost the ball again before<br />\nit could put points on the board.<br />\nFinally, with just three<br />\nminutes remaining in the first<br />\nhalf, Hopkins began to put<br />\ntogether a scoring drive. Taking<br />\nadvantage of a Hoya punt<br />\nblocked and recovered by<br />\nfreshman defensive standout<br />\nTodd Deiterich, the Blue Jays<br />\nmoved eleven yards in three plays<br />\nbefore quarterback Jim Margraff<br />\nhit freshman John Potthast with<br />\na touchdown pass, in the<br />\nendzone. Jeff Harris provided the<br />\nextra point, bringing the score to<br />\n21-7 with just two minutes to<br />\nplay.<br />\nBy carefully utilizing their<br />\nremaining time-outs, the Blue<br />\nJays regained possession of the<br />\nball at midfield with 54 seconds<br />\nleft in the half. Four plays and<br />\ntwo Hoya penalties later Hopkins<br />\nscored again, as Margraff<br />\nconnected with Potthast for<br />\nanother Blue Jay six. Harris'<br />\n<br />\nextra point left it 21-14 in the<br />\nfirst half.<br />\nIn the second half Georgetown<br />\nbegan to pull away, as Sitz<br />\nengineered a pair of<br />\ntime-consuming touchdown<br />\ndrives on the Hoyas' first two<br />\npossessions. But Hopkins'<br />\ndefense came alive again. With<br />\nthe Hoyas ahead 35-14 late in the<br />\nthird period, freshman Selwin<br />\nVickers recovered a bobbled<br />\nquarterback option pitch-out at<br />\nthe Georgetown 18 yard line to<br />\nset up another Blue Jay score, an<br />\n8-yard scramble by running back<br />\nKenny Bess. Harris' extra point<br />\nattempt failed, leaving the Blue<br />\nJays 15 points behind as the final<br />\nperiod began.<br />\nAfter a quick exchange of<br />\npunts, the Hoyas began to eat at<br />\nthe clock.

The Blue Jays completely<br />\ndominated the first half, taking<br />\nan amazing 21 shots on goal.<br />\nJunior Marty Wolf led the attack<br />\nwith 5 shots; he was helped by<br />\nChaim Levin and Lucien Brush.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays' first goal came midway<br />\nthrough the first half when Levin<br />\ntook a rebound off the goal post<br />\nand headed it up and into the<br />\nupper right-hand corner of the<br />\nWidener net.<br />\nSecond half action was more<br />\nevenly matched, with many<br />\nmid-field ball exchanges and few<br />\nstrong offensive drives. Brush<br />\nscored off a direct kick from 10<br />\nyards out and then scored again<br />\nminutes later on a short shot<br />\nwhich slipped past the Widener<br />\ngoalie. The Blue Jay backfied of<br />\nKen Suesse, Steve Galloway, and<br />\nJohn Triscoli did a fine job of<br />\ncontaining the Pioneer front line.<br />\nThis win followed up<br />\nSaturday's 1-0 shut-out of a<br />\nwell-skilled Franklin and<br />\nMarhshall team.

Marty Wolf, Bobby<br />\nTeasdall, and Ed Vance nearly<br />\nscored on several occasions<br />\nduring the first half, but<br />\nSwarthmore jumped into the lead<br />\nby beating goalie Ken Suesse one<br />\ntime.<br />\nIn the second half the Blue Jay<br />\ndefense of Suesse, Triscoli and<br />\nGalloway held tight, keeping the<br />\nball out of scoring- range.<br />\nSuddenly, Levin took a pass from<br />\nTeasdall, went one-on-one with<br />\nthe goalie and beat him out to tie<br />\nthe score at 1-1. Minutes later,<br />\nEd Vance gained possession of a<br />\nloose ball after a corner kick and<br />\neasily scored the winning goal.<br />\nVance also tallied the final goal<br />\nof the game, taking a long lead<br />\npass from Marty Wolf,booting<br />\nthe ball into the upper left hand<br />\ncorner of the net.

These<br />\nadvances have given Baltimore an<br />\n\"international reputation in<br />\ndevelopment.\"<br />\nMr. Brodie discussed how \"the<br />\nstrain of anti-urbanism in<br />\nAmerican life\" has contributed<br />\nto the flight of business and<br />\nmiddle and upper-income people<br />\nfrom American cities, including<br />\nBaltimore. ln the past, when<br />\nwealthier people moved outside<br />\nthe bounds of the city, Baltimore<br />\nwould annex the newly-inhabited<br />\nareas to preserve its tax base.<br />\nThus, Roland Park was absorbed<br />\nby the City in 1919. At that time<br />\nthe residents had no say in the<br />\nprocess, but since World War II<br />\nthey must approve any<br />\nannexation. According to Brodie,<br />\n<br />\nwith Baltimore's high tax rates,<br />\nresidents of a county will not do<br />\nthat. The result is a permanent<br />\nflight of relatively affluent<br />\npeople outside the city's fixed<br />\nboundaries, and an increasingly<br />\nhigh concentration of the elderly<br />\nand the poor people within the<br />\ncity, because they cannot afford<br />\nto live elsewhere. These are the<br />\npeople who are least able to pay<br />\ntaxes but require the most<br />\ngovernment services.<br />\nTo compensate for these<br />\nfinancial problems, Baltimore has<br />\ninstituted a property tax rate<br />\nabout twice as high as that in the<br />\ncounties. Faced with increasing<br />\nfiscal difficulties, the city has<br />\ntwo options: cut services, or<br />\nincrease revenue. The<br />\nDepartment of Housing and<br />\nCommunity Development's job is<br />\nto ensure the latter. One way to<br />\naugment the city's tax base is<br />\nthrough urban renewal that<br />\nbrings more taxpaying middle<br />\nincome people back to<br />\nBaltimore. The city currently has<br />\na homesteading program, in<br />\nwhich families can buy<br />\ndilapidated rowhouses at low<br />\nprices if they renovate the houses<br />\nwithin six months.<br />\nMany new housing<br />\ndevelopments are also being<br />\nbuilt Brodie noted that the city<br />\nis having equal difficulty<br />\nattracting either black or white<br />\nmiddle-income families to<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nBrodie said he was aware that<br />\nthese projects geneially ignore<br />\n<br />\npoor people, who are in<br />\ndesperate need of better housing<br />\nin Baltimore. But he said the city<br />\n\"cannot stress just low-income<br />\nhousing because that doesn't<br />\nbring in enough money like<br />\nmiddle-income housing.\"<br />\nBrodie claims the poverty<br />\nproblem cannot be helped by<br />\nhousing, but by jobs. He thinks<br />\ncity youths should be taught<br />\nmarketable skills in public<br />\nschools to facilitate their<br />\nemployment, something which is<br />\nnot currently being done. The<br />\nunemployment rate among black<br />\n<br />\nyouths is now 25 to 30%. The<br />\nnew white collar business now<br />\nbeing attracted to the city cannot<br />\nhelp them: \"The kind of entry<br />\njobs that existed for European<br />\nimmigrants 50 to 70 years ago do<br />\nnot exist anymore.\"<br />\nBrodie cited improvements<br />\nlike the new convention center<br />\nand subway, and an increase in<br />\nthe number of downtown<br />\nrestaurants. These are intended<br />\nto bring businessmen and tourists<br />\ninto the city. He stressed how<br />\nthese projects are only made<br />\npossible through the cooperation<br />\n<br />\nof government and business.<br />\nDespite the extra revenue<br />\ngenerated from these projects,<br />\nBrodie still thinks Baltimore will<br />\neventually be in financial trouble<br />\nwithout s Jme basic political<br />\nchange. He proposed the<br />\nabolition of local property taxes<br />\nand implementation of state-wide<br />\ngraduated taxes. Then Baltimore<br />\nwould have its current unevenly<br />\nhigh tax rate eliminated. Without<br />\nsome kind of change, he said,<br />\n\"that tax rate is going to kill us.\"<br />\n<br />\nTHE SENIOR CLASS FILM SERIES<br />\nPRESENTS...<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nTRUMAN CAPOTE'S<br />\n<br />\nIN COLD BLOOD<br />\n*STARRING*<br />\n*ROBERT*<br />\n*BLAKE*<br />\nFRIDAY & SATURDAY<br />\n<br />\n\"One of the finest<br />\npictures of the year<br />\nand possibly ofthe<br />\ndecade.\"<br />\nSATURDAY REVIEW<br />\nSHAFFER 3<br />\n<br />\nOCTOBER 27 & 2S<br />\n<br />\nADMISSION: $1.00<br />\n<br />\n7:30 & 10:00 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nSENIORS: $ .75<br />\n<br />\nOct. 27 - Friday at Midnight $1.00<br />\nOct. 28 - Saturday at Midnight<br />\n$1.50 & (costume contest)<br />\n<br />\n\fP.-1G1 8 V` OCTOBER\u201827; 1 978<br />\nmiles 300<br />\n<br />\nSouth African Black<br />\nUrges Divestment Step<br />\ncont. from p. 3<br />\nthe m ult in at onals.\" Rather,<br />\n:oreign investment supports the<br />\nexisting white dominance.

Furthermore, $4/day<br />\ncan go a fairly long way if some<br />\ncare is observed, such as working<br />\nduring non-prime-lime (in the<br />\nevenings or on the weekends).<br />\nI would also like to inform the<br />\nwriter that Dr. Bartels is<br />\nundoubtedly qualified to teach<br />\nthis course, having taught 24.63<br />\n(Computer Programming<br />\n<br />\nENOUGH<br />\nTO MAKE<br />\nYOU GLAD<br />\nYOU'RE<br />\nALIVE.<br />\nThere's great joy to be<br />\nfound in a Christian<br />\nScience church service.<br />\nIt comes from getting<br />\na clearer idea of God<br />\nas infinite good,and<br />\nof man as His image<br />\nand likeness.<br />\nIt comes from feeling<br />\nthe power of these<br />\nideas in each week's<br />\nLesson-Sermon, read<br />\nfrom the Bible and<br />\nfrom the Christian<br />\nScience textbook.<br />\nIt comes from seeing<br />\nwhat was hopeless<br />\nor painful in your<br />\nexperience replaced<br />\nby the certainty<br />\nof rod<br />\nYou can eave the<br />\nservice with a lighter<br />\nheart... and ready to<br />\ngladden others, too.<br />\n<br />\n4P<br />\n<br />\nCHRISTIAN SCIENCE<br />\nSUNDAY SERVICES<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nSunday Morning- 11 a.m.<br />\nSunday Evening- 7:30 p.m.<br />\nFIRST CHURCH OF<br />\nCHRIST, SCIENTIST<br />\n102 West University Pkwy.<br />\n<br />\nWorkshop) previously, among<br />\nother Math.Sci. courses.<br />\nAs regards the matter of<br />\nincreasing the workload, if it is<br />\ngenuinely excessive, it would<br />\nseem that this would be reflected<br />\nin the work of the class as a<br />\nwhole, and should not affect<br />\nindividual grades.

Most of us here at<br />\nHopkins spend our days in<br />\nintellectual pursuit quite<br />\noblivious of the people who keep<br />\nour buildings and grounds clean<br />\nand operational. It is easy to<br />\nforget them as they scurry about<br />\nquietly emptying trash, cleaning<br />\nfloors and restrooms. Their work<br />\nis consistently productive and<br />\nessential to the daily health and<br />\n<br />\nwell-being of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity (which is a good deal<br />\nmore than many of us can say),<br />\nyet they are often forgotten.<br />\nWell, now they can be forgotten<br />\nentirely. Because if you happen<br />\nto work a normal workday, say<br />\nanytime between eight in the<br />\nmorning and nine at night, you<br />\nneed never cast your eyes upon<br />\nthese .unappreciated members of<br />\nthe Hopkins community again. A<br />\nrecent change in policy now<br />\nrequires much of the custodial<br />\nstaff to work from eleven at<br />\nnight to seven in the morning.<br />\nWhy?<br />\nVic Zanella,<br />\nAccording to<br />\nmanager of housekeeping, the<br />\nchange of the night shift, \"while<br />\nan inconvenience to the people<br />\n(custodians), was well worth the<br />\ntradeoff in increased productivity<br />\nto be gained from night work.\"<br />\nHe went on to say that budget<br />\nrevisions necessitated the<br />\nchanging to the night shift.

We disliked each other's music, politics, study<br />\nhabits and brand of whisky, but whatever smacked ot<br />\nmerde du taureau to one produced an equal reaction in<br />\nthe other, and in that respect we might have been Siamese<br />\ntwins.Late autumn mornings, especially, the cramped and<br />\nchilly dorm room would reek with the offending stench,<br />\nfor it was then that I usually returned, swearing under my<br />\nbreath, from Contemporary American Letters.<br />\nLike most aspiring young authors, I came to this<br />\ncampus with certain ideas about writing, one being that it<br />\njust can't be taught...at least, not in a classroom. I also<br />\narrived, however, with a more or less open mind, and<br />\nquickly determined to give the Writing Seminars<br />\nDepartment a fair chance to change my way of thinking.<br />\nAccordingly, I shelved Intro Psycho for a year and<br />\npenciled in CAL in its stead.<br />\nI will not attempt to give anything resembling a full<br />\naccount of the atrocities perpetrated in that literary<br />\nchamber of horros, for I haven't nearly the stomach for it.<br />\nWhat I will do is relate a few of the more memorable<br />\ninstances, which should give the reader a fairly good idea<br />\nofjust what 22.5 (oh,innocent title!) was all about.<br />\nThe underlying principle of the class was that nothing<br />\nyou did, no matter how outrageous, was ever wrong.<br />\n(Being the product of a Jesuit education, this naturally<br />\nstruck me as damnable heresy from the very first). No<br />\nmatter what foul garbage was spewed out by the empty<br />\nminds of my classmates, it was instantly justified as being<br />\n\"creative\" and an \"honest expression of his/her inner<br />\nfeelings.\" No matter what imbecilic scribbling was daily<br />\nhanded in,. it always came back bearing the scarlet letter<br />\nand an impassioned request that it should be read aloud<br />\nso that all might hear and benefit. Our TA seemed<br />\nincapable of shaking her head to show even the slightest<br />\ntouch of disapproval no matter how incredible the offense<br />\nagainst common intelligence, and I began staring intently<br />\nat the back of that worthy's neck, trying to determine if<br />\nany tendons had been cut (I still believe a lobotomy is<br />\nrequired). Many were the times I was forced to bite my<br />\ntongue and sit on my writhing hands while listening to<br />\nsome malodorous tirade about God-knows-what, lest I<br />\nstrike out and bloody the offending mouth in my<br />\nrighteous rage.<br />\nI remember one gruesome incident in particular that to<br />\nthis day never fails to boggle and becloud my mind. It was<br />\ngetting near the end of the semester, and I was<br />\ndesperately hoping that the worst crimes were over and I<br />\ncould glide thiough December without losing my temper<br />\nor any more of my breakfasts. Gentle reader, it was not to<br />\nbe.<br />\nThe assignment for that day had been to \"explore an<br />\nunconventional aspect of literature that has a special<br />\nmeaning for you\" or some nonsense to that effect. Near<br />\nthe end of the interminable hour the time came for a<br />\nparticularly airheaded female to give her presentation.<br />\nNow, from past experience I was fearing the worst, but<br />\nher performance that day easily left my wildest .<br />\nnightmares in the dust. She sat there (oh, I remember it<br />\nwell!) straight of face, steady of voice, and proceeded to'<br />\nread a poem... backwards. She announced weightily to the<br />\nroom at large that she was proving \"that poems can be<br />\njust as meaningful and valid when read in reverse.\"<br />\nI whipped my head around and gazed imploringly into<br />\nthe TA's face. Surely this was too much, even for her;<br />\nsurely this lastest and greatest outrage would bring her to<br />\n<br />\nher long forgotten senses! But to my consternation, to my<br />\nhorror; all I beheld was that same approving smile and the<br />\nsame benign head bobbing up and down with a cheery<br />\nvigour, if anything more empathic than usual!<br />\nOH! PROPHETESS OF THE NEW LITERARY AGE!<br />\nOh revealer of the ONE TRUE CRITICISM! No airhead<br />\nshe, but rather a VOICE OF TRUTH RINGING OUT OF<br />\nTHE DARK NESS! Away with meter and meaning and all<br />\nthe rest of the ancient lies which have blinded us to<br />\npoetry's true soul! The Eternal Circle is<br />\ncompleted...foreward they were written and BACK WARD<br />\nTHEY SHALL BE READ!<br />\nOh why, WHY didn't I see it all before? It's so simple<br />\nand yet so right! Consider Tennyson's Ulysses, just as an<br />\nexample : For years, people have been reading the last<br />\nlines as...<br />\nTo strive,<br />\nTo seek,<br />\nTo find,<br />\nAnd not to yield!<br />\n<br />\nFor the most part they travel (like all stupid and<br />\ncowardly animals do) in packs. Without constant<br />\nreassurance from others of their own kind that the Nobel<br />\nPrize is near at hand, their whole house of self-important<br />\ncards would crumble and blow away like the pages of so<br />\nmany Classic Comics. Needless to say, I usually give such<br />\ngibbering flocks a wide berth, but there always arise those<br />\nvexing times when a confrontation becomes inevitable.<br />\nOne night last Spring, for instance, found me and another<br />\nlusty English major in the Baker abode of a sprightly New<br />\nJersey nymph (that's nymph, not nympho) when<br />\nsuddenly the door burst open and half a dozen of the<br />\n<br />\naudie:<br />\nTurni<br />\n<br />\nYou<br />\n<br />\nanswc<br />\nit ech<br />\nand s<br />\nfloor.<br />\n<br />\nHo<br />\nthe oi<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n,<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n,,,-)j.. ,-.- ..,*\u20221,<br />\n. .'<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n...how vague, stilted, and stuffy; how enormously<br />\ninferior that sounds when compared to the new<br />\nreading...the glorious new REVERSED READING!...<br />\n<br />\nez.\\<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\":-'<br />\n- 1<br />\n.,.. 4<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n...k-'7.<br />\n<br />\n..,<br />\nf ...t)<br />\n..<br />\n\u2022<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n.4 . ,. .<br />\n<br />\n:.\u2022<br />\n\u2022,.1. i<br />\n<br />\n,\u2022<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n,..f .<br />\n\u2022<br />\nHit s i '<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\n.,<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n/1\",<br />\n<br />\n_. ..<br />\n\u2022,,,,:::.<br />\n\u2022 \\.,<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1.,<br />\n<br />\n.. .<br />\n<br />\n..<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n..\u2022..<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n--.,. - -es<br />\n...<br />\nAr -<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\nI-ir.:1<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n....<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nDole and mete I, wife aged and with match'd<br />\nCrags barren these among, hearth still this by<br />\nKing idle an that profits little it.<br />\n%ist-high bullshit, you say'?...son, I was hangin' from the<br />\nrafters.<br />\nI certainly don't want to give anyone the impression<br />\nthat I think all students in the Writing Seminars to be<br />\nliterary clowns on the order of the one mentioned above.<br />\nOne of the first things instilled by a quality liberal<br />\neducation is a fear of sweeping generalizations, and I've<br />\nbeen paying attention in class.

The Bard had spoken. Being a kind<br />\nphilosopher-king, however, he was willing to humor his<br />\naudience by pretending to ask their opinions as well.<br />\nTurning to my friend and I, he inquireu gravely \"How do<br />\nYou fellows deal with cohesiveness?\" My associate<br />\nanswered by breaking wind with such a cruel ferocity that<br />\nit echoed down the deserted halls, shook the dewy panes,<br />\nand sent a cup of cappuchino instantly crashing to the<br />\nfloor.<br />\nHow else are you gonna deal with these people?...it's<br />\nthe only language they really understand.<br />\n<br />\nOccasionally some of these feather-headed charlatans<br />\nWill have the audacity to show their faces in an English<br />\nclass and presume to discuss literature among serious<br />\ndisciples of the craft. The results are always distressing.<br />\nThe most amazing thing about their opinions on the<br />\nsubject is not that they are ludicrous (which they most<br />\ncertainly are) out that they are identical from ;I<br />\nhack. It never ceases to amaze me how such a s.z.able<br />\ngroup of mostluito-brains are drawn only to literature's<br />\nporch light...wily don't they buzz around somebody else<br />\nfor Christsake? And, like mosquitoes, they all make<br />\nexactly the same noise. Stated briefly,the party line is as<br />\nfollows : We are now privileged to live in a literary Golden<br />\nAge, where page after page of sublime pencraft need only<br />\nto be plucked from the gently rocking boughs of New<br />\nArcadia. Scribes of worth abound these days as never<br />\nbefore, and all one need to do is close his eyes, shut off<br />\nhis brain, put pen to paper, and wait to join the rank.; 9f<br />\n<br />\nthe Immortals of prose and poetry. All which came before<br />\nwas mere prologue--just cave-paintings, really, when<br />\ncompared to what modern author-deities, local and<br />\notherwise, now offer to a grateful public (This public,<br />\nincidentally, has no more fervant wish, it seems, than to<br />\nperuse the creative efforts of undergraduates).<br />\nSuch is the philosophy of the Writing Department's<br />\nenfants terribles, and such is. the manure which is shoved<br />\ninto our faces when these creatures invade English classes.<br />\nAs I've said, the Past for them is dead. Consequently,<br />\nwhen discussing an author of old, they do not weigh his<br />\nmerits and weaknesses, rather they merely dismiss him.<br />\nSome examples, I think, will amply suffice:<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDickens--A clever fellow, but his dialogues are stiff.<br />\nShakespeare--Quite good for a homosexual.<br />\nTennyson-- a jingoist.<br />\nDonne--\"Who?\"<br />\nCrane--A warmonger. Same goes for Hemingway.<br />\n...and so forth. Thrice an hour I have heard<br />\ncomments on Hamlet that would make old Bill turn over<br />\nin his grave. If there are more such writing students at<br />\nother universities, the ground at Stratford must be very<br />\nunquiet indeed, for the honored playwright is surely<br />\ntwirling at a furious rate.<br />\nTheir verbiage is laced with tell-tale words which<br />\nimmediately alert the enlightened members of the class<br />\nto their presence. Gems like \"cosmic,\" \"intense,\"<br />\n\"relate,\" and \"existential\" are always in abundant supply,<br />\nbeing plugged into their ramblings to cover the unsightly<br />\nholes where the thoughts should have gone. Now,English<br />\nmajors are by and large a tolerant lot--slow to anger and<br />\nopen in outlook, but, like anyone else, we can be pushed<br />\ntoo far. So, when one of these irritating empty helmets<br />\nruns amok and begins to waste too much of our time, we<br />\nare forced to assume the role of The Enforcer. We don't<br />\nlike to, you understand it's quite distasteful to us, but<br />\nsooner or later the pissants must be squelched. Once the<br />\ndecision is made to use The Enforcer, justice is swift.<br />\nTake, for example, a discussion of The Sun Also Rises.<br />\nAirhead : If you want my opinion, I don't see why we're<br />\nreading this book at all. I think any so-called novel about<br />\nsome macho bully-boy completely devoid of feelings is<br />\njust invalid, and I can't get in touch with his...<br />\nThe Enforcer: What about the very moving passage on<br />\npage 49 at the bottom, where he confesses his love for<br />\nBrett and admits he's afraid of the dark?<br />\nAirhead : Well, I don't really want to argue about such a...<br />\nThe Enforcer: That's page 49, the one right before 50,<br />\nwhy don't we take a look?<br />\nAirhead: Well, now that you mention it, there might be<br />\nsome existentialist aspects worth...<br />\nThe Enforcer: And that's another thing. I confess to being<br />\nquite uninformed about the existentialists' movement.<br />\nWould you please summarize it for me?<br />\nAirhead: I'm...uh...sure we wouldn't...uh...I mean...<br />\nThe Enforcer: Then, at least, list some novels for us that<br />\nyou don't consider to be existentialist.<br />\nAirhead :Please...I...don't feel very well...please...Oh God<br />\nNeedless to say, from now on a mere sidelong glance<br />\nfrom<br />\nThe Enforcer's direction is enough to stifle a<br />\ndozen such clowns. It's like Bacardi One-Fifty-One:<br />\npainful, but it gets the job done.<br />\nThe worst of it, by far, is their writing. Or as they<br />\nprefer to put it, their writing. As for the short stories,<br />\n<br />\nthey are always too long. (This can be attributed to the<br />\nfact that they put you to sleep after the first page rather<br />\nthan to their actual length) If they can be said to have a<br />\ngeneral theme at all, it is this: Life is meaningless. Almost<br />\ninvariably they are about some derelict or pervert or<br />\ncripple who goes from bad to wretched due to the evil<br />\nmachinations of a malignant force over which he has<br />\nabsolutely no control. The major characters, if there are<br />\nany, show no intelligence, spontaneity, or humanity, and<br />\nbear little resemblance to creatures of this world. They<br />\nare not people so much as animate dung-heaps. Those are<br />\nthe better variety. In the rest, nothing of any interest<br />\noccurs. People eat breakfast, or stare out of a tenement<br />\nwindow, or sunbathe, or perform some equally mundane<br />\ntask until we are brought, in eager anticipation, to the<br />\nshattering, electrifying climax which always reads : The<br />\nEnd.<br />\nI've lost patience with these sad philosophers. If, after<br />\nreading one of their doleful tales, I picked up the Morning<br />\nSun and read of their attempted suicide, I might at least<br />\nbelieve in their sincerity if not their craft. As it stands,<br />\nhowever, these same somber sages are to be seen reveling<br />\namong the foremost Disco Night regulars and laughing<br />\njust as loudly and frequently as any of their \"less<br />\nhardened\" classmates ambling across the quads. The truth<br />\nis obvious--they write of hopelessness without knowing<br />\nanything of its true cost. They write of bitterness because<br />\nthey believe that all writers worth their salt are expected<br />\nto be bitter. Their \"deep sadness\" over the human<br />\ncondition springs not from a conviction, but rather from<br />\nfashion. They wear despair like a Halloween costume, and<br />\nunderstandably, we fail to be frightened.<br />\nJ ust as the theme of these stories have been wrought<br />\nwithout conflict, characterization, or plot; so too the<br />\nstructure is devoid of syntax, punctuation, or form. There<br />\nseems to be among them a great, burning desire to be<br />\noriginal. My beef is that it has been obtained at the<br />\nexpense of quality. As Truman Capote once said, \"It's not<br />\nwriting, it's just typing.\"<br />\nIs this sad situation really the fault of the Writing<br />\nSeminars Department? To be honest, I really can't say for<br />\nsure. After Contemporary American Letters, I withdrew<br />\nall my efforts from that area like a hand recoiling from a<br />\nwhite-hot flame. That CAL type of \"instruction,\"<br />\nhowever, has cropped up before me again from time to<br />\n. time. A young lady once pulled the poems she was writing<br />\nfor class out of a drawer and eagerly begged my opinion.<br />\nShe said that her TA was quite proud of the work, but<br />\nsuggested that she \"stop thinking and concentrate on<br />\nimagery.\" Stop thinking--sage advice for anyone who<br />\nwants to pass CAL. Advice which I fear too many in that<br />\nmajor have brought with them to the more rewarding<br />\nadvanced courses.<br />\nBy now, I must appear as some pint-sized academic<br />\nreactionary, opposed to all change and fearful of any<br />\ninnovation. I sincerely hope that isn't the case--but the<br />\nman who constantly sees the barbarians sharpening their<br />\nspears outside the city walls has understandably little<br />\npatience for talk of leniency toward them in the Senate<br />\nChamber. Perhaps I'm angry because so little of the really<br />\ngood creative writing on this campus finds its way to the<br />\nFeatures desk; perhaps I wrote this polemic because I'm<br />\njust jealous of my more worthy competitors; maybe my<br />\nextreme views spring from insecurity. Perhaps...but I<br />\nreally think the truth is simply that, like Joel happen to<br />\nhave a sensitive nose.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 I OCTOBER 27, 1978<br />\n<br />\nHigh Rollers Find Paradise In Jersey<br />\nby Ozurd D.<br />\nNew Jersey, Land of the Rising Odor and Lowering<br />\nMoral.

I've always been a gambler, however,<br />\nand that perhaps explains why I still take a chance in<br />\nletting my lungs breathe what New Jersey dares to call air.<br />\nBetting has always been a part of my life--from almost<br />\ndaily nickel-dime poker games at my house from about<br />\nthe eighth grade on, to playing blackjack on the sly in my<br />\nCatholic high school, to finally betting with an older<br />\nbrother as to whether or not my little brother will<br />\ngraduate from that same high school (my hundred dollars<br />\nsays the little nipper walks away with the sheepskin).<br />\nReligion, too, has been a gamble for me recently. I won<br />\n$25 on John Paul I. but lost $100 on the remake. The<br />\nLord does indeed work in mysterious (and<br />\nsometimes,costly) ways. In any event, imagine my delight<br />\nwhen the Casino Referendum passed in New Jersey! Now,<br />\nat last, only an hour and a half south on the Garden State<br />\nParkway was the world of craps, blackjack, roulette, fast<br />\nwomen, easy fortune, and lost paychecks; in a word, a<br />\ngambler's paradise. Atlantic City, once thought to be a<br />\ndecaying metropolis, was magically transformed into a<br />\ndecaying metropolis with a casino.<br />\nNatually I had to go. Sure I couldn't afford it, but that<br />\ndidn't stop me. The gambler's mind is fundamentally<br />\nirrational. Questions like \"how am I going to pay for gas<br />\nand tolls?' and \"how am I going to eat next week?\" are<br />\nconveniently ignored.ln mid-June I made my first trip to<br />\nthe Resorts International Casino with my oldest brother.<br />\nThe casino is large ard visually impressive, about the size<br />\nof a football field. The carpeting is thick, orange and<br />\nbrown. The ceiling is covered with an array of<br />\nbubble-shaped objects which conceal cameras used to<br />\ndetect cheaters, both patrons and employees. There are<br />\nsix ways to throw your money away in Atlantic City:<br />\ncraps, roulette, baccarat, blackjack, big six (a<br />\ncarnival-type wheel which pays from even money to 40:1),<br />\nand slot machines. Minimum bets at blackjack are $2,<br />\nmaximum, $3000. Other than knowing that the minimum<br />\nbet at baccarat is $20, I don't know limits for other<br />\ngames, as blackjack is all I play. The casino takes an<br />\naverage of slightly over $18/hour per bettor at the other<br />\ngames. It was very crowded my first trip, as Resorts was<br />\nand still is the only game in town. Waits of three hours or<br />\nmore for a seat were not uncommon throughout the<br />\nsummer.<br />\nMy brother bankrolled me that first trip, and I won<br />\n$90. Not bad, I thought for my first time out with the big<br />\n<br />\nboys. I walked around a bit, just observing my fellow<br />\ninmates in the asylum. There's a preponderance of old<br />\nladies at the slots, and they tend to become attached to<br />\ntheir machines, screaming in near-orgasmic frenzy when<br />\nthey win big, and who reluctantly,disgustedly slip away<br />\nwhen the machine has taken the last of their coins. Craps<br />\nplayers are typically loud and jumpy, cigars or cigarettes<br />\nnervously dangling from their mouths. Blackjack players<br />\n(myself included) tend to be obsessive, constantly playing<br />\nwith their chips, not-so-silently-cussing when the dealer<br />\nhas gotten his/her fifth 21 in a row. Baccarat players are<br />\nthe \"elite\" of the casino, having a very plush room to<br />\n<br />\nthemselves roped off on the side.<br />\nI made a few more trips to Resorts over the summer,<br />\nstill unable to afford it. Through hard work and bad luck<br />\nI was able to give back the $90, plus $15 to boot. Oh<br />\nwell, at least drinks are free when you're gambling.<br />\nThey're also very strong, the theory being drunk gamblers<br />\nare a whole lot more reckless than sober ones. Casino<br />\nhours are 10:00 am-,6:00 am Friday and Saturday. The<br />\ncasino also requires men to wear jackets after six pin. I<br />\npresume they want losers to at least look presentable<br />\nwhen they're contemplating suicide after they've lost the<br />\nmoney for their wife's operation. One night a few blocks<br />\n<br />\nfrom the casino, after the casino had already closed, my<br />\nfriend was offered twenty dollars for his jacket by<br />\nsomeone rushing to get his last bets down. Unfortunately<br />\nthe jacket was worth more than twenty dollars.<br />\nIn early August, due to my having good enough sense<br />\nto sue two of my brothers when the opportunity<br />\npresented itself, I became a member of the nouveau riche.<br />\nShortly thereafter, I went back to the casino, this time<br />\nplaying at the $25 table. I was determined to either make<br />\nor lose $500. I travelled home that day with only one<br />\nbulge in my pants. I made no more trips to Resorts before<br />\nschool started. Here I discovered Atlantic City is easily<br />\nreached by taking route 95 to the Delaware Memorial<br />\nBridge, then just over the bridge take U.S. 40 east straight<br />\ninto Atlantic City. Time: approximately three hours. AtialP<br />\n)<br />\nthe end of September, I made a pit-stop there with my<br />\nroommate and girlfriend on my way home for the<br />\nweekend. My girlfriend got pinched and propositioned by<br />\none of a group of five Puerto Ricans. I won $630. All in<br />\nall, we both did well.<br />\nFiguring I had Resort's number, I went back last week.<br />\nI didn't quite have their number. I was down $400 an<br />\nhour before we left. I managed to get it back, plus $750,<br />\nbut it was close. A strange thing happened, though, that<br />\nday. The $100 table was right behind me and all of a<br />\nsudden a man started a loud argument with the dealer. He<br />\nclaimed that he had not been paid on two successive<br />\nhands. The pit boss was called over. The man was<br />\nadamant,claiming he had been cheated. The manager was<br />\ncalled over, and asked the man how much he wanted. He<br />\nsaid $4000. The manager immediately wrote out a check<br />\nfor that amount, and gave it to him. I was at first<br />\nsurprised by this, but then realized the guy was going to<br />\nlose it right back, so Resorts wasn't going to lost<br />\nanything; it was also good public relations. The only other<br />\nunusual thing to happen that day was that my girlfriend<br />\nwas propositioned again, this time by a guy who was<br />\nplaying at the same table with me. Oh lucky girl!<br />\nHowever, he was a big loser, and I'm the only loser she'll<br />\ntolerate.<br />\nThe last trip I overheard some U of Penn. students who<br />\ntermed the casino \"U. of Penn. east.\" It then hit me that<br />\nit's a great idea for all Hopkins students to go to the<br />\ncasino. If you win, great! The money is essentially<br />\ntax-free (you don't report it); literally you have made out<br />\nlike a bandit. If you lose, just come back to Homewood,<br />\ngo to the Financial Aid Office, tell them you're broke,and<br />\nthey'll give you grants and work-study. You can't lose<br />\neither way. Maybe Papa Stevie would rent a bus for us. In<br />\nany event,/V be at Resorts tomorrow.<br />\n<br />\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<br />\n<br />\n* Gays Say Nix To Prop Six *<br />\nSan Diego, Ca.(CPS) -- As the limousine pulls into view,<br />\nthe crowd of demonstrators that had gathered at the<br />\nentrance to San Diego's Town and Country Hotel begins<br />\nto shout and jeer:<br />\n\"Two, Four, Six, Three/We're the Queers From<br />\nUCSD.\"<br />\nThe car stops at the curb, and John Briggs, the<br />\nlock-jawed, crew-cut state senator from Orange County,<br />\nsteps out.<br />\nSuddenly, a slender young man wearing nail polish and<br />\nan earring breaks through the line of hotel security people<br />\nto confront Briggs. The protester is immediately arrested<br />\nafter the two exchange epithets. Three others are<br />\nultimately arrested in the protest against Briggs and the<br />\nanti-gay California.initiative, he authored for the state's<br />\nNovember ballot.<br />\nThe initiative is popularly. called the Briggs Initiative,<br />\nand formally known as Proposition 6's proponents reason<br />\nin a fund-raising letter written by the Butcher-Ford<br />\nagercy -- the same firm that managed the Proposition 13<br />\ncampaign in the state last June -- that since the rest of the<br />\nnation looks to California for change and fashion, \"We're<br />\ngoing to show them that morality is back in style.\"<br />\nThis campaign, of course, is only the latest<br />\nanti-homosexual political movement. In every vote thus<br />\nfar -- in Wichita, St. Paul, and Eugene, Oregon -- gay rights<br />\nactivists have met defeat.<br />\nThey may well be headed for another defeat in<br />\nCalifornia.<br />\nSponsor Briggs, who claims to<br />\nhave had a personal experience with Jesus Christ,<br />\nhas been in a leadership position of many anti-gay<br />\ncampaigns since first serving as a volunteer in<br />\n<br />\nAnita Bryant's crusade in Dade County, Florida.<br />\nNot coincidentally, many observers see some<br />\n1000 evangelical and fundamentalist churches<br />\nserving as the back bone of his California support<br />\nas well.<br />\nYet he also has a fair amount of support from the<br />\nstate's -healthy conservative forces. It was, in fact, his<br />\nentry into the state Republican gubernatorial primary as a<br />\nconservative leader that motivated Proposition 6 in the<br />\nfirst place.<br />\nTo increase his state-wide name identification, Briggs<br />\nstarted two petition drives to get measures on the ballot.<br />\nThe anti-homosexuality measure was the first. The<br />\nsecond, a proposal to make the death penalty cover more<br />\nkinds of crimes, is now Proposition 7 on the November<br />\nballot.<br />\nHe got them on the ballot by raising $1 million for his<br />\ncommittee, Californians To Defend Our Children. The<br />\ncommittee, in turn, hired a professional campaign firm to<br />\ncollect signatures at 50 cents each.<br />\nThe anti-homosexuality campaign is relying on<br />\ntelevision commercials, some of which feature photos of<br />\nthe Houston boys killed several years ago by homosexual<br />\nDean Allen Corill. There are also photos of the victims of<br />\nCalifornia's homosexual trash bag murders being dug up.<br />\nYet the measure these ads promote is somewhat vague<br />\nin wording. Its opponents fear it would sanction the firing<br />\nof teachers for simply telling their students that Spartan<br />\nGreece was a gay culture. It might effectively prohibit<br />\nteachers from drinking at gay bars, having any gay friends,<br />\nassigning books by gay authors, or belonging to clubs that<br />\nmight have gay memebers.<br />\nA group called No On 6 was organized to oppose the<br />\n<br />\ninitiative. The committee has sought support from visibly<br />\n\"mainstream\" groups, and it has largely succeeded. The<br />\nNo On 6 committee has also gotten support from a<br />\nnumber of churches, like the United Church of Christ and<br />\nthe United Presbyterian Church, and from most of the<br />\nstate's liberal establishment.<br />\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, for example, has<br />\ncondemned the initiative as a violation of the First<br />\nAmendment. The California Teachers Association and the<br />\nstate AFL-CIO oppose Proposition 6 because of the<br />\npotential impact on member workers. Governor Jerrrall'\\<br />\nBrown, Sen. Alan Crariston, the entire Los Angeles City )<br />\nCouncil, San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson, the Young<br />\nRepublicans, and a handful of Hollywood stars like<br />\nShirley MacLaine, Paut Newman, and Natalie Wood also<br />\noppose the measure.<br />\nNo On 6 plans a million-dollar campaign of its own,<br />\nwith ads claiming,\"It's Not Just Dumb-- It's Dangerous.\".<br />\nYet, there's an element of fear within the<br />\nanti 6 campaign.. David Mixner, the chairman of No On 6<br />\nand a veteran of many liberal political campaigns, says<br />\nmost supporters of his committee aren't altogether<br />\nassertive in their support.<br />\nHe reports receiving \"a lot\" of $49 contributions from<br />\npeople who don't want to file their donations with the<br />\nFair Political Practices Commissiou, which records the<br />\nnames of those who've made con:ributions of $50 or<br />\nmore.<br />\nRecent polls meanwhile, put the election up for grabs.<br />\nThe prestigious Field poll and a CBS poll both show<br />\nProposition 6 winning handily, though the polls were<br />\ntaken before former Governor Ronald Reagan said he<br />\nwasn't going to support it.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-1,ET7ER<br />\nFlawless typing of dissertations,<br />\ntheses, papers, etc. -$.90 PAGE<br />\nAlso provide complete<br />\nproofreading, editing & revision if<br />\ndesired.

A Doll's Muse has long been recognized as<br />\none of the most controversial plays dealing with the role<br />\nof women in society and at home. It was one of the<br />\nearliest pieces of literature which dealt with the issue of<br />\nwhether or not women were capable of taking an equal<br />\nstand in society.<br />\nA )In House clearly brings to the surface many of<br />\nthe issu s involved in controversies between men an 1<br />\nwomen. The right of a woman to lead her own hie,<br />\nindependent of her husband, the idea of sacrifitng one s<br />\nideals and ambitions for love, the problems of worm n<br />\nbeing judged on the same basis as men while beim tie\" \u2022J<br />\ndifferently in all other aspects of life. All are de: ,s h<br />\nthe course of this play.<br />\nlbsen's personal views on feminism are never stated in<br />\nthis play; he takes no stand, but portrays both men and<br />\nwomen in a ridiculous light at times. However, at the time<br />\nthe play was written (1879), the mere recognition aid<br />\nverbalization of the unequal treatment of women s-as<br />\nenough to label a person a feminist for life. Ibsen sticeti<br />\nafterward that he was not a feminist, but that he %Arai<br />\nsimply trying to accurately portray the current attitu le<br />\ntoward women; still, he was outcast from literary circles<br />\nand his plays were sometimes banned.<br />\nIn a modern light, A Doll k house seems not only mild,<br />\nbut practically anti-feminist. The heroine, Niqa. is a<br />\ncont. on p. 18<br />\n<br />\nThis weekend, there will be midnight showings of The<br />\nRocky Horror Picture Show, a film whose popularity has<br />\nswept the country this summer. It is a rock musical about<br />\na transvestite from outerspace, and a parody of the old<br />\n'grade-B' science fiction movies like Tarantula and Night<br />\nof the Living Dead. But more than a movie, it has caused<br />\nthe evolution ,of a cultural phenomenon, the 'Rocky<br />\nHorror Picture Show' cult.<br />\nPerhaps the birthplace of the 'Rocky' cult was at the<br />\nWaverly Theater in Greenwich Village where it played<br />\nevery Friday and Saturday night at midnight for 31<br />\n/<br />\n2 years.<br />\nAt first, only a few people would see it more than once or<br />\ntwice, but gradually this accelerated to the point where<br />\npeople would see it forty and fifty times.Of course,<br />\nnobody could sit through the same movie that many<br />\ntimes without having it affect them, and without they<br />\naffecting it.<br />\nCertain rituals began to develop. For example,<br />\ninterjecting lines at key places in the film: Frank--I see<br />\nyou shiver with antici-... (pause) Audience--Say it!<br />\nFrank\u2014pation! In the next stage of development, the<br />\naudience began to bring props: rice for the wedding scene;<br />\ntoast for when one is proposed at the dinner. At this<br />\npoint, the popularity of The Rocky Horror Picture Show<br />\nbegan to spread throughout the East Coast, primarily in<br />\ncollege communities. Finally however, in New York, the<br />\nfilm reached a point of stagnation, and after over three<br />\nyears it closed.<br />\nHow can the popularity of The Rocky Horror Picture<br />\nShow be accounted for? Perhaps it is the quality of the<br />\nfilm.

McCarthy. Doubleday & Company, Inc. New York.<br />\n1978. 57.95.<br />\nMay 9, 1831: Two young French magistrates, on a<br />\nmission to study prison reform, landed in Newport,<br />\nRhode Island and began their study of America. Traveling<br />\nby horse, carriage, canoe and steamer, they explored<br />\nEastern cities and Western wilderness, interviewed<br />\njournalists, politicians, planters, and ordinary citizens, and<br />\ncritically probed the strengths, weaknesses, and future of<br />\nAmerican democracy. These young men, Alexis de<br />\nToqueville and Gustave de Beaumont, collaborated on<br />\nDemocracy in Anzerica.<br />\n1978: An elder statesman and former Presidential<br />\ncandidate, a native American and no stranger to its<br />\npolitical system, has re-evaluated Democracy in America<br />\nfor the 1970's. Examining Indians, prisons, blacks,<br />\nreligion, economy, law, the media, \"voluntary<br />\nassociations,\" politics, the Presidency, and America's<br />\nfuture, he uses Toqueville's insights as a springboard for<br />\nhis own. This man, familiar with America's shortcomings,<br />\ncalls for a moral solution. This man is Eugene McCarthy.<br />\nAmerica Revisited discusses current issues by<br />\ncomparing Toqueville's Jacksonian America with<br />\nMcCarthy's own.

For some, the concert is merely<br />\nthe playing of their albums live, before an audience--it's<br />\nlike watching a record. For others, the live performance is<br />\na totally different experience. The concert captures the<br />\nauditory aspect that is part of the studio album, but it<br />\nadds another--the visual--dimension. Thus, the importance<br />\nof a concert is not just to hear the music performed, but<br />\nto see it performed. On a studio album, a listener can't see<br />\nMick Jagger strutting around, or Pete Townshend leaping<br />\nin the air and Roger Daltry swinging his mike; one can't<br />\nn see the lasers, dry ice and elaborate backdrops that<br />\nt bands use in concert. This visual element is the<br />\nprimary thing that differentiates a band in concert from a<br />\nband on record,<br />\nThe question then arises as to the motives for taking a<br />\nconcert, with all its additional visuality, and putting it<br />\nback on record. The live album is an interesting yet<br />\ndisturbing phenomenon in rock music. The album<br />\neliminates the visual element which is so important in a<br />\nlive performance, and records only the auditory part. The<br />\nlive album defeats the major purpose behind the live<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nperformance. Ideally, the only way a live/albuni could be<br />\nconsidered a success would be if it captured the auditory<br />\naspect so well that the listener \"feels\" he is seeing it.<br />\nOtherwise the live album is essentially worthless without<br />\nthe visual elements.<br />\nUnfortunately, it is extremely rare that an album can<br />\nrecord the live \"feel\" of the music, and make the listener<br />\n\"see\" the concert. The Who Live At Leeds is the greatest<br />\nexample of this ideal live album. One can't see the stage<br />\nantics of The Who, but more than on any other live<br />\nalbum, one can truly get a vivid feel for the visual<br />\nelements of the concert. The greatest selling live album,<br />\nFrampton Comes Alive, is a good album, but it sounds<br />\nlike nothing more than a studio album with audience<br />\nresponses tracked in throughout the songs. Conceptually,<br />\nthe most inventive live album is Running on Empty by<br />\nJackson Browne. He recorded a live album with entirely<br />\nnew compositions about live performances and being on<br />\nthe road. Although the songs occasionally digress into<br />\nself-indulgent introspection like on earlier albums,<br />\nBrowne's concept is so unique that it can never be<br />\nduplicated without being called an imitation. But the<br />\nessence of most live albums is to try to capture as well as<br />\nIIY VINAY LAL<br />\nMadame Rosa is adapted from the script of Momo, a<br />\nel by Emile Ajar. Unlike the novel, which is said to<br />\ne focused on the boy Momo, the movie concentrates<br />\non Madame Rosa. This is one of the great failings of<br />\nMadame Rosa.<br />\nThe movie was directed in Paris by Moshe Mizrahi. The<br />\nsetting is a Jewish ghetto in Paris. Madame Rosa (Simon<br />\nSignore\u00b0 is an aged and' ailing Jewish lady, a former<br />\nprostitute, running an orphanage for the children of<br />\nprostitutes. In spite of her sordid past, she. tries to raise<br />\nthe children 'straight', a seemingly impossible task. Her<br />\nparticular favorite among her wards is Momo, who she<br />\nkeeps in the da;'; about his age for fear that he may<br />\nabandon her.<br />\nMadame Rosa is an \"implacably humane and<br />\ncourageous\" woman (more appropriately a whore) who,<br />\nas film critic Robert Hatch said, \"is a vehicle for Simone<br />\nSignoret's formidable repertory of histrionics.\" She is, to<br />\nbe precise, disgusting; even Momo, her faithful angel,<br />\nadmits so at one point. Madame Rosa's ugliness<br />\novercomes any good points the movie may have.<br />\nMizrahi occasionally (and unsuccessfully) attempts to<br />\nadd touches of light comedy to this essentially morbid<br />\nfilm. Although Madame Rosa is Jewish, Momo has been<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\npossible the auditory aspect of a concert, and to try to<br />\nrelate that musically to the visual aspect. This is<br />\nextremely difficult, and it is rare that a live album<br />\nsufficiently achieves this ideal.<br />\nGranted, live albums do a poor job of capturing the live<br />\nperformances, but groups continue to release them<br />\nnonetheless. The motives behind a live album are not<br />\nalways idealistic. The most obvious ulterior motive is<br />\nmaterialistic: since groups are expected to perform live,<br />\nthere is little expense involved in recording a concert and<br />\nputting out an album, thus increasing sales and profits.<br />\nYet, on inspection of five recently released live albums,<br />\nthe apparent motives seem hardly as crude, and much<br />\nmore interesting and complex.<br />\nThe motives behind the live Crack the Sky album Live<br />\nSky are rather desperate. It has been about a year since<br />\nthe release of SaPty In Numbers for which the group<br />\ngained national popularity. John Palumbo,<br />\nleader/guitarist/I cad vocalist, wrote all the songs as he<br />\nhad on previous albums, but because of disagreements, he<br />\ndid not play or sing on most of the album. He completely<br />\nleft the band after the album's release to pursue different<br />\nmusical directions. The band toured without him, and<br />\nfrom this tour they derived the live album. The chief<br />\nmotive for releasing a live album was not to capture a<br />\nmonumental tour (which it was not) on vinyl, but with<br />\nthe loss of their creative leader, Crack the Sky would have<br />\ngreat troubles recording a studio album with new material<br />\nthat would be an adequate follow-up to the last album.<br />\nThe only way they can sustain their popularity and delay<br />\na decision on the status of the band is through a live<br />\nalbum. The motives behind Live Sky are purely dilatory.<br />\nA Jethro Tull concert is always a tremendous event,<br />\nand as a frontman, Ian Anderson is one of the great rock<br />\nstars of the Seventies, but the motives behind Bursting<br />\nOut hardly seem true to the ideal of the live album. The<br />\nresponse to the madrigal-like compositions on Heavy<br />\nHorses was negative, and even with the success with Songs<br />\nFrom the Wood before - that, fans are crying out for<br />\nmusic like that on Aqualung and Thick as a Brick-- Tull<br />\nfavorites from the early Seventies. But the musical style<br />\nof Jethro Tull has evolved, and the evolution for the most<br />\npart is irreversible. And since Tull had already released<br />\nseveral greatest hit albums (another disturbing<br />\nphenomenon), the only way to keep their die-hard fans<br />\nwith them despite the changing style is to play<br />\n\"Aqualung\" again on a live album, and sustain the hope<br />\nthat they may play it again on a studio album. As long as<br />\nthey hear \"Aqualung,\" even if the studio albums don't<br />\nproduce equivalents, followers will continue to listen.<br />\nBursting Out does a good job of capturing the live Tull<br />\nexperience, but it also proves they aren't too old to rock<br />\nand roll, it gives fans new versions of old favorites and<br />\nmost importantly, it helps Tull retain their popularity<br />\ndespite the unpopularity of their recent studio albums.<br />\nThe Blue Oyster Cult live album, Some Enchanted<br />\nEvening, is a live album for the sake of putting out a live<br />\nalbum. The recording is just shoddy performance of their<br />\nshoddy studio material, the difference being that the<br />\nsound which is loud, unclean and hollow on the studio<br />\nalbums is even more so on the live one.<br />\nLive At Last, the Steeleye Span live album, is also<br />\npointless as a release. It is a recording of the band's final<br />\nconcert before they disbanded 'amicably' five days later.<br />\nBut for a band that never performed in America, this<br />\nraised as a Moslem. Madame Rosa relates to Momo her<br />\nexperiences in German concentration camps, making<br />\ntrivial jokes here and there. The audience is told that<br />\nevery breath may be her last; thus, some suspense is<br />\ngenerated. Her amateurish attempts to keep herself from<br />\nbeing removed to the hospital (since she believes that<br />\n<br />\nMadame Rosa:<br />\nLife<br />\nWithout Love<br />\none's suffering must not be prolonged, at the expense of<br />\nproviding doctors \"tools\" for their medical research) are, at<br />\ntimes, mildly humorous. At all other times, the movie<br />\ndoes not even make a pretense to provide subtle humor.<br />\nAnother \"disguisting feature\" of the movie is the<br />\nover-abundance of whores. The grossness of their person<br />\nand performance is repelling. Not only do these whores,<br />\nbut Madame Rosa, too, show that fine cinematographers,<br />\nsuch as Nestor Armendros need equally fine directors to<br />\ndisplay their talent.<br />\n<br />\nconcert, no matter how memorable it is for the band, is of<br />\nno importance to American listeners. Unlike The Last<br />\nWaltz by The Band, the group that has been on the<br />\nAmerican musical scene for 16 years, the preservation of<br />\nSteeleye Span's final concert is worthless.<br />\nThe motives behind David Bowie's live album Stage<br />\nseem most ideal, but even his motives are questionable.<br />\nThis is the second live Bowie recording. The first was a<br />\ngreatest hits-type album, admirably capturing Bowie<br />\nfavorites in concert. The same is true of the new live<br />\nalbum, except that the material is taken strictly from his<br />\nfour studio albums since David Live. But why did Bowie<br />\n<br />\nDavid Bowie from Stage<br />\nput out another live album with material from only four<br />\nalbums whose popularity was much less than his earlier<br />\nalbums? The music on the newer studio albums<br />\neliminated stories and characters, and became more<br />\nexperimental and mechanical. The Bowie concert also<br />\nchanged. He emerged from behind the masks of his<br />\ncharacters and performed straightforwardly on a stage<br />\nwith a backdrop of vertical white lights. This kind of<br />\nstaging emphasized the starkness of his studio albums, the<br />\nsame way the.staging for his other live album emphasized<br />\nthe characters and stories. Although every Bowie album is<br />\na new musical experience, perhaps Stage signals the end of<br />\nan era of generalized musical form, just like'David Live<br />\nsignalled the end of an era of the Spiders from Mars. The<br />\n'motives behind the new live recording are to capture the<br />\nessence of this Bowie era in concert, and on the next<br />\nstudio album, we can look for a totally different sound.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that within the corpus of live albums,<br />\nthere is such diversity among the motives behind the<br />\nrelease of concert recordings. And it is a shame that the<br />\nmotives are so rarely ideal or artistic. These five live<br />\nalbums are good, but their purpose is ulterior, and they<br />\nfail drastically to capture the pure energy and excitement<br />\nof a live performance on record. Nothing can replace being<br />\nthere.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n4<br />\nEvery critical and concerned viewer must, after<br />\nwatching Madame Rosa, ask himself what purpose art<br />\nshould serve. Should it merely entertain and pacify the<br />\nmind, or should it be a commentary on the nature of<br />\nhuman beings? Madame Rosa, an emotional tale of<br />\nsurrogate motherhood, does pose several questions of<br />\ngrave importance, despite its faults. Must an ill person,<br />\nwhose death is imminent, have his suffering prolonged<br />\nagainst his own will? Although Dr. Katz (Claude<br />\nDauphin), Madam Rosa's personal physician, claims it is<br />\ninhuman to kill a person (regardless of how sick he may<br />\nbe), the question is left unanswered, partly due to the<br />\nnature of the question, and partly due to the failing of the<br />\ndirector to make himself convincing. As Stephen Pepper<br />\nof Harvard said: \"But if the spectator is not weak, there is<br />\nno reason why the work of art should not explain itself ...<br />\nWhen it is necessary to ask an artist what he was trying to<br />\ndo (as the viewer must ask himself), either the spectator<br />\nor the artist is weak.\"<br />\nThe movie ends on a somber note. Madame Rosa<br />\neventually dies, to the relief of the spectator. Momo, in<br />\nfilial devotion, sleeps in the same room with the decaying<br />\nbody for three weeks. This implies that, as human beings,<br />\nwe must love each other, perhaps \"even to a nauseating<br />\nlevel,\" irrespective of our beliefs, religion, or race. An<br />\nadmirable 'me, yes, but , it's carried too far.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 18 OCTOBER 27,', 1978<br />\n<br />\n'A Doll's House' at Theatre Hopkins<br />\ncont. from p. 16<br />\nwoman who has allowed herself to be manipulated by<br />\nmen all her life; first by her father, then by her husband.<br />\nThe husband, Torvald, considers his wife to be nothing<br />\nmore than a plaything, a child who has no intellect who is<br />\nthere for his pleasure and amusement. Nora cheerfully<br />\nfulfills his expectations for eight years before she realizes<br />\nthat she is a person in her own right, capable of leading<br />\nlife and, most importantly, thinking for<br />\nher own<br />\nherself. It is this realization, and the events leading up to<br />\nit, which form the basis for the plot of this play.<br />\nTheatre Hopkins' production of the play is<br />\ncommendable. The play is difficult to perform because<br />\nmany of the symbols rely on precise lighting, scenery and<br />\nprops. The costumes in this production are perfect, the<br />\nlighting accurate, and \u2022 the props, with the exception<br />\nperhaps of the Christmas tree, work well. Cherie Weinert<br />\n(Nora) is outstanding, making the other characters pale by<br />\ncomparison. She is Torvald's perfect \"little lark.\" her<br />\n<br />\ndancing of the Tarantella is wild and passionate as a<br />\nyoung girl's, yet she makes the transition into a self-aware<br />\ngrown woman as naturally as it is possible, given the<br />\nstory. Michael Gilbert, (Torvald), is a little too stiff,<br />\nseeming to be uncomfortable with his lines (although it's<br />\nnot hard to imagine why). He sounds overly patronizing,<br />\neven for Torvald. Toward the middle of the performance<br />\nhe began to relax and his acting improved immensely.<br />\nMilton Freedman (Dr. Rank) and Wendy Wilson (Kristine<br />\nLinde) are both excellent in their roles as Nora's friends<br />\nand confidants. Peter Gzowski (Nils Krogstad) is an<br />\nabsolu tely despicable corrupted moneylend.er who<br />\nthreatens Nora's protected existence, and Allison Kellner<br />\n(Nora's daughter EMmy) is amazing, her expressions and<br />\ngestures incredibly similar to Ms. Weinart's.<br />\nA Doll's House will be playing in the Barn Theater<br />\nFriday and Saturday nights at 8:30, and Sunday<br />\nafternoons at 2:15 through November 12. Hurry and<br />\nreserve your tickets--it is a play that everyone must see. \u2022<br />\n<br />\nAt Tlie Bijou<br />\nOn October 27, 28, and 29, the Baltimore Film Forum<br />\nand the Baltimore Museum of Art will show eight French<br />\nfilms, never shown commercially in this country. The<br />\nfilms. made available to us by the French Embassy, will<br />\nhave an admission charge of $1.00 for Film Forum and<br />\nMuseum members, $1.50 for the general public. Films will<br />\nbe screened at the Baltimore Museum of A i's<br />\nauditorium and there will be NO ADVANCE SALES.<br />\nTickets may be purchased at the door for that day's films<br />\none half hour before screening. The schedule of films is as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n<br />\nRocky Horror Show... Stoned Scare (p. 16)<br />\n'grade-C' pornography, however this is far from true. The<br />\nproduction has many talented performers: the star Tim<br />\nCurry (Frank Furter) is a Shakespearian actor; Susan<br />\nSaradon (Janet) has starred in many films such as The<br />\nOther Side of Midnight and Pretty Baby; Barry Bostock<br />\n(Brad) is an acting member of the New York Metropolitan<br />\nOpera; and this film gave Meatloaf (Eddie) his start,<br />\nhelping to make him what he is today.<br />\nAnother reason is that the movie gives the viewers a<br />\nchance to escape from social pressures, whether they are<br />\ndue to excess school work or socially ridiculed sexual<br />\npreferences among other things. `Rocky' gives them a<br />\nchance to escape into an unreal fantasy world. As one of<br />\nthe last songs in the score says, 'Rose tints my world,<br />\nkeeps me safe from my trouble and pain. It's beyond me.<br />\nHelp me morning ...<br />\nThe most essential reason for the film's success is that it<br />\ngives alienated members of society a pseudo-religious cult.<br />\nThere is a sense of importance' and belonging in the<br />\nritualism of the film. Many of the cultists have been<br />\nthrust into unstable social positions, and cult membership<br />\nhelps to alleviate this feeling of displacement. Indeed,<br />\nthere are some religious parallels in the film. At the<br />\n<br />\nbeginning of the film. 'hard-core' cultists scream out,<br />\n'And the Lord said: Let there be Lips!' In the movie<br />\ni-tself, there are 'guiding lights from darkness' and 'the fall<br />\nfrom Grace'. In fact,'hard-core' cultists have been known<br />\nto call the Waverly Theater 'Church'.<br />\nOf course, one should not overemphasize this aspect of<br />\nthe movie. There are a large number of 'hard-core'<br />\ncultists, but there are an equally large number of people<br />\nwho go just to escape and relax in the crazy atmosphere,<br />\nor use it as another of the many excuses to smoke or to<br />\npop. The best part about this movie is watching the<br />\npeople in line and in the audience. In New York, the lines<br />\nwould be two blocks long, even in the dead of winter. But<br />\nthe cultists would still be out in force, some dressed only<br />\nin girdles, black stockings and garter belts. A showing can<br />\nundoubtedly be described as a major social event, one<br />\nthat is well-worth attending.<br />\nAt any rate, it is advised that everyone should<br />\nexperience The Rocky Horror Picture Show . It is far<br />\nabove other cult films such as Pink Flamingos and Andy<br />\nWarhol's Bad. Don't be put off by the word 'cult'.

Koka, the<br />\ngeneral secretary of the Black<br />\nAllied Workers Union, and an<br />\nindicted co-conspirator in the<br />\ntrial of the II Soweto student<br />\nleaders is currently touring the<br />\nUnited States after escaping<br />\narrest for his part in the 1976<br />\nSoweto Rebellion.<br />\nKoka began his address by<br />\ndescribing the living conditions<br />\nof blacks, in South Africa.<br />\nStressing that he spoke from<br />\npersonal experience, not<br />\nacademic research, he recounted<br />\nthe racial inequalities prevalent in<br />\nhis country. South Africa's<br />\npopulation. is 26 million. Only<br />\nfour million are whites, yet they<br />\nown 87% of the land, squeezing<br />\nthe 20 million blacks onto the<br />\nremaining 13%. Blacks must live<br />\nin all -black areas called<br />\n\"homelands\" unless they have<br />\npermission to work in the cities.<br />\nConsequently, :unemployment<br />\nranks as a major problem for<br />\nblacks, with lack of training and<br />\nthe inability of live in urban areas<br />\npreventing blacks from getting<br />\ndecent jobs.<br />\nKoka explained that, contrary<br />\nto popular opinion, the presence<br />\nof foreign corporations in South<br />\nAfrica does not improve blacks'<br />\nemployment chances. Because of<br />\na governmentally-imposed quota<br />\nsystem, employers can hire only<br />\na limited number of blacks. Thus<br />\nthe \"black man is not profiting<br />\nin any way by the presence of<br /><br />\nread \"UC Invests in Death.\" It<br />\nfluttered, briefly, at the top of<br />\nthe highest flagpole on the<br />\nUniversity of California-Berkeley<br />\ncampus one morning late last<br />\nmonth, until the school hired a<br />\nclimber to remove it.

New York papers,<br />\nespecially the New York Times<br />\nBook Review, have traditionally<br />\nbeen where most publishers<br />\npromote their new books. Since<br />\nthe strike has continued through<br />\nthe publishers' prime fall selling<br />\nseason, the publishers are<br />\nworried. But the newsletter<br />\nfound the \"big books by name<br />\nauthors are le3s likely to be hurt<br />\nby the strike than first novels<br />\nby unknown authors.\"<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThus new books by established<br />\nauthors like Mario Puzo, James<br />\nMichener, Theodore White and<br />\nBarbara Tuchman are selling well<br />\nin New York in spite of the<br />\nstrike. But Lynn Bond of Barnes<br />\n&amp; Noble Bookstores told BP<br />\nReport that the strike has made<br />\nit hard to sell first-time authors'<br />\nworks.<br />\nHelp may be on the way. To<br /><br />\ntake up the advertising slack<br />\ncreated by the strike, periodicals<br />\nlike Time, the New Republic,<br />\nNewsweek, New Yorker,I and even<br />\nSports Illustrated are printed<br />\nexpanded or newly-created book<br />\nsections.<br /><br />\none on California campuses,<br />\nwhere in the past two years<br />\nrecord numbers of demonstrators<br />\nprotested investments in South<br />\nAfrica. But as the students<br />\nreturned, so did divestiture<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThe flagpole banner was the<br />\nfirst sign of a regenerated<br />\ndivestiture movement. A<br />\nspokesman for BAFFL(Bay Area<br />\nFree Levitator) said the ascent of<br />\nthe 100-foot flagpole was<br />\n\"in<br />\norder to dramatize<br />\nthis<br />\nuniversity's involvement with a<br />\nracist, apartheid nation which has<br />\nshown utmost disregard for the<br />\nrights and lives of the majority of<br />\nits citizens.\" The spokesperson<br />\npromised more messages.<br />\nThen, also at Berkeley, the UC<br />\nAssociated Student Senate voted<br />\nat its first meeting to stop<br />\nstocking the AS jewelry store<br />\nwith gold and diamonds from<br />\nSouth Africa.<br />\nWhile the new policy will allow<br />\nselling of jewelry already on the<br />\nshelves, it requires posting of<br />\nsigns at the store's entrance<br />\nwarning that by buying gold and<br />\ndiamonds there they may be<br />\nsupporting South Africa's<br />\noppressive regime.<br />\nDon Davis of Students for<br />\nEconomic and Racial Justice<br />\n(SERJ) testified at the meeting<br />\nthat the AS action was consistent<br />\nwith referenda showing a<br />\ncont. to p. 8<br /><br />\nBlack Frat Formed;<br />\nService Is Stressed<br />\nPhi Beta Sigma, the new black<br />\nservice fraternity at Hopkins, is<br />\ntrying to make the students nere<br />\naware of its existence.

He feels that the Greek<br />\nSing scheduled for November 3rd<br />\nwill serve to effectively introduce<br />\nthe frat to everyone at Hopkins.<br />\nMany of the frats will perform in<br />\nthe Sing, which Phi Beta Sigma is<br />\norganizing. The proceeds from<br />\nthis event will go to the<br />\nChaplain's Tutoring Program.<br />\nPhi Beta Sigma Vice-President<br />\nRandy McVane said there is a<br />\nneed for an efficient black service<br />\norganization on campus.

This attitude is<br />\nviewed with .favor by<br />\nadministrators who know about<br />\nthe frat. The Phi Beta Sigma<br />\nchapter here is one of many<br />\nthroughout the nation.

Almost invariably, such openings in the past,<br />\ntwo years have been filled by promotion from within the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nPeter Heiss was Housing Director two years ago. After a<br />\nwoman burned herself up rather than leave the apartment in<br />\nwhich she had been barricaded for years, Heiss slowly went<br />\noff the deep end. He was quietly replaced, and was last seen<br />\ndriving a cab somewhere in West Baltimore. His successor,<br />\nLarry Frelow, was one of the few University employees<br />\nactually fired for incompetence, in the middle of the year,<br />\nno less. His assistant, Umran Uras, was given the job as a<br />\nstopgap, a makeshift solution which slowly developed into a<br />\npermanent one. Which brings us back to the place this talc<br />\nbegan.<br />\nThe Housing Director is not a minor functionar.y, but an<br />\nimportant official. Snould someone within the University<br />\nhappen to be the most competent person available to fill<br />\nUmran's spot, fine. But there is plenty of time for the<br />\nUniversity to take a hard look around for the most capable<br />\nreplacement available anywhere. A conscious decision<br />\nshould be made, one based on ability rather than<br />\nexpediency.<br /><br />\nTechnology Time<br />\nto regard itself as one of the<br />\nresearch<br />\ninstitutions. No expense is<br />\ncountry's foremost<br />\nspared in obtaining the most modern equipment fpr<br />\nmeasuring and mapping the physical universe with<br />\nprecision. How then is it possible that the Gilman clock, the<br />\nvery heart of the University, has been frequently inaccurate<br />\nduring the past two weeks. Facilities must constantly be<br />\nrenovated if Hopkins is to remain in the vanguard of<br />\nuniversities into the 1980's and beyond. The antiquated if<br />\nquaint machine atop the Gilman tower belongs in a<br />\nmuseum.

Pfeffer<br />\nwas trying to warn the graduating<br />\nstudents against allowing<br />\nthemselves to become so many<br />\nmore absorbed elements of \"the<br />\nsystem\" (a difficult thing to do,<br />\nfor it is this pathway that usually<br />\nleads to greatest economic and<br />\nsocial status). Instead, everyone<br />\nshould look objectively at this<br />\nsystem, and try to change what<br />\nhe understands to be wrong. We<br />\nare the persons who will make<br />\nuseful changes in the future, if<br />\nwe recognize our responsibility<br />\nto do so.<br />\nYour editorial calls Pfeffer's<br />\nviews \"an intellectual crock,\"<br />\nthen proceeds to criticize small\"<br />\nsegments of the speech, with no<br />\nreference to the context in which<br />\nthe ideas were used. The issue<br />\nwas not whether chemical food<br />\nadditives are \"healthy\"--every<br />\nyear there is more evidence<br />\nagainst their use, and we have<br />\nonly begun to research their ill<br />\neffects--it was that the need for<br />\nsuch adulteration of food comes<br />\nfrom the need for more profits.<br />\nPfeffer used this point as one of<br />\nhis many valid criticisms of<br />\ncapitalist society. (I would<br />\nassume that the Belgian food<br />\nindustry is making a determined<br />\neffort to have any additive bans<br />\nrepealed).<br />\nThe editorial demonstrated<br />\none of Pfeffer's statements: we<br />\nare made to feel \"...that it is<br />\nnaive and utopian, if not actually<br />\nsubversive, to even think that<br />\nthere might .be a much better<br />\nway to organize our lives.\" We<br />\nshould not be content with our<br />\nlot merely because, relative to<br />\nother nations or to the past, it ie<br />\n\"the best.\" (\"Our candles bun<br />\nbrighter than everyone else's so<br />\nwhy bother thinking about<br />\nelectric lights?':) Complacency<br />\ncan lead only to stagnation.<br />\nThe editorial entitled \"Red<br />\nThere may not be a war in<br />\nRick's Report\" (Oct. 20) is a Vietnam or a Nixon in the White<br />\ndisgrace.

Why are the<br />\nSoviet Union and Marxism<br />\nimmediately mentioned<br />\nwhenever someone criticizes the<br />\nU.S. or proposes radical change?<br />\nI did not see the words<br />\n\"Marxism\" or \"Marxist\" in the<br />\ntext of the speech. While<br />\nPfeffer's ideas are certainly<br />\ncompatible v, ith Marxist<br />\nphilosophy, they are common to<br />\nmany other progressive<br />\nsocial/economic ideologies as<br />\nwell. There are other alternatives<br />\nto capitalism. (By the way,<br />\nMarxism is not \"a rigid,<br />\ndeterministic dogma\" unless one<br />\nmisinterprets it. The Soviet<br />\nUnion has horribly distorted<br />\nMarxist government).<br />\nIn conclusion, I would<br />\nrecommend a thorough<br />\nreexamination of Pfeffer's speech<br />\nfrom a less paranoiac point of<br />\nview. His dream of a government<br />\ndesigned to satisfy meaningful<br />\nhuman needs and in which<br />\nappearance and reality are the<br />\nsame is one shared, by persons<br />\nranging from Buckminster Fuller<br />\nto Timothy Leary to I.F. Stone.<br />\nIf your editorial truly reflects the<br />\nstudent attitudes toward this<br />\nideal, then we are in serious<br />\ntrouble.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nMark D. Skoner<br /><br />\nwhich, in itself, is undeniably<br />\ncommendable when one<br />\nconsiders the evident injustices<br />\npresent in our society.<br />\nHis attitude is one that at least<br />\nlooks toward the future, and this<br />\nprogressive view is much more<br />\ndesirable than the reactionary<br />\none expressed by the editor, who<br />\nfails to look beyond his own<br />\nnarrow cultural conception. What<br />\ndoes the editor mean by stating<br />\nthat Westerners \"live the longest,<br />\nhealthiest lives in human<br />\nhistory.\" To suggests that this is<br />\ngrounds for complacency is quite<br />\nludicrous. If, indeed, the editor's<br />\nwords have any real meaning,<br />\nthen this would seem to be the<br />\n\"logical\" inference. The<br />\ndiscussion of freedom of thought<br />\nin the universities is,<br />\nfurthermore, certainly ironic<br />\nwhen one considers the outcome<br />\nof the Pfeffer tenure decision.<br />\nThe really sad thing about this<br />\neditorial is not that it expresses<br />\nan opinion (to which I would not<br />\nobject), but that it purports to<br />\nrefute a complex intellectual<br />\nposition with a snap of the<br />\nfingers. Despite the protestations<br />\nof enlightened thinking, the<br />\neditor truly has much in common<br />\nwith stereotypical \"sixteenth<br />\ncentury peasants.\" In the future<br />\nthe editor should remember his<br />\nobligation, financial and<br />\notherwise, to the University and,<br />\nhence, the student body. Perhaps<br />\nthen we will see the end of such<br />\nirresponsible demagoguery.<br />\nHoward Kaplan<br /><br />\nLow Blow<br /><br />\nLuce Disputed<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to respond to the<br />\nOct. 20 editorial, \"Red Rick's<br />\n:sic) Report.\" This is not a<br />\nlefense of Dr. Pfeffer's position,<br />\nbut an examination of the<br />\nexquisitely intelligent and<br />\nopen-minded comments of the<br />\nNews-Letter editor. Admittedly I<br />\nhave learned not to expect much<br />\nfrom this paper's editorials, but<br />\non the other hand, this one is too<br />\nmuqi to passively accept. The<br />\neditorial, more than any other<br />\nsection of the paper, must<br />\ndemonstrate responsible and<br />\njudicious thinking, since it is the<br />\nprinciple mode by which the<br />\nNews-Letter should attempt to<br />\ninfluence the opinion of the<br />\ncommunity. The shoddy<br />\nreasonings and half-baked<br />\nconclusions of the Pfeffer<br />\neditorial demonstrate the editor's<br />\nfailure to live up to his<br />\nfundamental obligations.<br />\nI am hardly a confirmed<br />\nMarxist, but to assert<br />\ncategorically that their views are<br />\n\"wild and patently implausible\"<br />\nindicates that, in this instance,<br />\nthe ecii.or ;mows liist-hand more<br />\nabout \"intellectual crock\" than<br />\nhe lets on. The main thrust of the<br />\neditor's argument seems to be:<br />\n\"Why be critical of our present<br />\nsociety when it is no worse than<br />\nany other past or present?\" This<br />\ncertainly misses the whole point.<br />\nHoy/ever dubious .are his<br />\nmotivations, Dr. Pfeffer is<br />\nconcerned with outlining a<br />\nsocietal critique- an ambition<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nMr. Luce's criticisms of<br />\ngovernment functioning and<br />\nlabor conditions. Although the<br />\naverage age of government<br />\nofficials and representatives is<br />\nolder compared to that of the<br />\nUnited States, we, as citizens of<br />\n\u2022 the Republic of China, do not see<br />\nany wrong with that as long as<br />\nthey serve the people well.<br />\nFurther, the government has<br />\nundertaken a series of steps of<br />\nreorganization. For instance,<br />\nmore new representatives<br />\nreplacing older ones have been<br />\nelected, and more younger<br />\nofficials recruited into key<br />\noffices. Also, in our country, it is<br />\nmandatory for six to fifteen year<br />\nold youngsters to attend school.<br />\nIt is unlikely for those between<br />\nthe ages of \"10 and 14\" to work<br />\nin \"U.S. factories\" shedding their<br />\n\"blood, sweat, and tears\" as Mr.<br />\nLuce suggested. However,<br />\nstudents over 15 in vocational<br />\nprograms can work, but are hired<br />\nonly as work-study students. The<br />\naverage wage for those who work<br />\nwork-study in the U.S. is $75 per<br />\nmonth.<br />\nAs Chinese students in this<br />\nschool, most of whom were born<br />\nand grew up in Taiwan, we are<br />\nmore than happy to share our<br />\nknowledge of life in Taiwan with<br />\nanyone who has further<br />\nquestions.

We must not expect the return of the<br />\n'noble savage,' but the establishment of conditions which<br />\nallow and encourage Indians to live with<br />\ndignity--conditions of reasonable economic and cultural<br />\nsecurity.\"<br />\nEconomy: Despite the incredible amount of conspicuous<br />\nconsumption, \"things are not desperate in the United<br />\nStates. The nation still has the potential to meet its<br />\neconomic needs. What is called for is<br />\nre-examination...How far have we gone down the road<br />\ntoward destroying ourselves as civil and social<br />\nbeings?...What is called for is continuing moral response?<br />\nnot one requiring unusual sacrifice of heroic virtues, but<br />\nan acceptance of restraint within reasonable limits, of<br />\nresponsibility toward nature and the resources of the<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nThe Presidency: \"The essential strength of the Presidency<br />\nshould rest in the office itself--not in the person who<br />\noccupies it at a given time...The limits of power should be<br />\ndefined as carefully as possible, and honored in practice.<br />\nWhen unconstitutional use of presidential power is not<br />\nchecked in time, there is clear and demonstrated danger<br />\nthat Congress, in reaction, and sometimes in an effort to<br />\ncover for Congressional neglect and failure, will abuse the<br />\npresidential office and hamper Presidents in the proper<br />\nexercise of their Constitutional powers. Overreactions of<br />\nthis kind, demonstrated in the post-Vietnam and<br /><br />\nli<br /><br />\n) dim! am) )ww)<br /><br />\n)<br /><br />\n)<br /><br />\npost-Watergate periods, lead not only to unconstitutional<br />\ngovernment, but also to less effective government.\"<br />\nDespite McCarthy's and Toqueville's differences in age,<br />\nnationality, and governmental experience, both authors<br />\nretain a sense of optimism about America and reflect<br />\nAmerica's growth. Toqueville writes about an America<br />\nwhich is still young and largely unexplored, yet he senses<br />\nthe dangers of democracy--citizens relying too heavily<br />\nupon Big Government, freedom of press getting out of<br />\ncontrol, demogoguery, etc. McCarthy describes an older,<br />\nmore tired America, whose citizens take a less active role<br />\nin their government and press, and too often, submit to<br />\nthe stifling hand of corporate and federal bureaucracy.<br />\nYet, McCarthy, too, has faith in American democracy.<br />\nPerhaps there is something in America, itself, that<br />\nsustains individual morality against the equally forceful<br />\ntendency of the citizenry toward self-tyrannization. But<br />\nAmericans would be wise to heed Toqueville's and<br />\nMcCarthy's words. As Toqueville warned, \"No one will<br />\never believe that a liberal, wise, and energetic government<br />\ncan spring from the suffrages of a subservient people.\"<br />\nEugene McCarthy will speak at the MSE Symposium on<br />\n\u2022<br />\nNovember 1 at 4 p.m.<br /><br />\nPHOTOGRAPHY<br />\nthe eye we are told<br />\nis a camera<br />\nbut the film is the heart<br />\nnot the brain<br />\nand our hands joining<br />\nthose that reach<br />\ndevelop the product<br /><br />\nof winter yet<br />\nthere are those who would have<br />\nno other season<br />\nit's always easy when thinking<br />\nwe have the best to assume<br />\nothers covet it<br />\nyet surf or sea each has<br />\nits lovers and its meaning<br />\nfor love<br /><br />\nit's easy sitting in the sun<br />\nto forget that cold exists<br />\nlet alone envelopes<br />\nthe lives of people<br />\nit's easy sitting in the sun<br />\nto forget the ice and ravages<br /><br />\nwatching the red sun bleed<br />\ninto the ocean<br />\none thinks of the beauty that fire brings<br />\nif the eye is a camera and the film is the heart<br />\nthen the photo assistant is god<br />\nfrom cotton candy on a rainy day<br /><br />\nINNII MO<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nSupplies<br /><br />\nNikki<br />\nqiovANNi<br /><br />\nBooks<br /><br />\nWELCOME<br />\nPARENTS<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nmeasure Dome CO Easy &amp; Filling Foods<br /><br />\n44<br /><br />\nTHE HOMEWOOD<br />\nDELICATESSEN<br />\nJUST ABOVE 31st STREET<br />\n3105 ST PAUL ST<br />\nOpen Daily 9-9<br /><br />\n467-7882<br /><br />\nOpen Sunday 9-5<br /><br />\n\"Baltimore's Best\" BALTIMORE Magazine<br /><br />\nThe Bookcenter will<br />\nbe open Saturday,<br />\nOctober 28 from<br />\n9:30 A.M. - 2:00 P.M.<br /><br />\nALWAYS<br />\nHOT JUICY CORNED BEEF<br />\nSANDWICHES $ 1.49 EACH<br />\nFRIED CHICKEN PLATTERS<br />\nLEG or BREAST<br />\n$ 1.29<br />\nWITH DELICIOUS WESTERN FRIES<br />\nALWAYS HOT NEW YORK BAGELS<br />\nLOX \u2014 SMOKED FISH,<br />\nSABLE PICKLED HERRING<br />\nMEAT AND POTATO KNISHES<br />\nDELICIOUS FRESHMADE SOUP<br />\nNATURAL FOOD DEPARTMENT<br /><br />\nPAGE 20 I OCTOBER 27, 1978<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOffice of Special Events presents<br /><br />\nN-L<br />\n\n\"THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS:<br />\nLOOKING BACKWARD AND FOWARD<br />\nDa.

MILLER<br />\nFive first-half fumbles and a<br />\nrash of penalties paved the way<br />\nto disaster last Saturday, as the<br />\nundefeated Georgetown<br />\nUniversity football team rolled to<br />\na 42-20 victory over the hapless<br />\nBlue Jays. The loss dropped<br />\nHopkins' record to 2-4, all but<br />\nerasing the Jay' chances for their<br />\nfirst winning season since 1973.<br />\nThe Hoyas wasted little time<br />\n*umping into the lead, as senior<br />\nuarterback Bob Sitz combined<br />\nwith wide receiver Clayton<br />\n'Wagner<br />\non an eight-yard<br />\ntouchdown pass. The score<br />\ncapped a six-play Georgetown<br />\ndrive which began when Blue Jay<br />\nrunning back Matt Martello<br />\nfumbled the ball away at the<br />\nHopkins 36 on the fourth play of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThree plays later Georgetown<br />\nscored again, taking advantage of<br />\na bobbled Blue Jay kickoff<br />\nreturn to set up a 7-yard<br />\ntouchdown run by halfback<br />\nAndy Murray. Kicker Jim<br />\nCorcoran added another extra<br />\npoint, giving the Hoyas a 14-0<br />\nlead only six minutes into the<br />\ncontest.<br />\nOn the next Georgetown<br />\npossession the Blue Jay defense<br />\nheld the Hoyas, as a 37-yard<br />\nCorcoral field goal attempt<br />\nbounced off the uprights to open<br />\nthe second quarter. Hopkins took<br />\npossession at its own 20 yard<br />\nline, but quickly surrendered the<br />\nball a third time when senior<br />\ntri-captain Kenny Bess fumbled<br />\non the first play from scrimmage,<br /><br />\nii<br /><br />\nFive plays later the I loyas scored<br />\nagain, giving them a 21-0 lead.<br />\nThe Blue Jays lost the ball<br />\nagain on their next possession,<br />\nbut heads-up defensive play by<br />\nlinemen Ned Sacha and Selwin<br />\nalert Hopkins<br />\nVickers and<br />\nsecondary forced the Hoyas to<br />\npunt the ball away for the first<br />\ntime in the contest.<br />\nOn the first play of the series<br />\nthat followed burly Blue Jay<br />\nrunning back Kenny Bess burst<br />\nthrough a wall of blockers and<br />\nraced 58 yards to the Hoya three<br />\nbefore being knocked out of<br />\nbounds. But once more Blue Jay<br />\nexecution broke down, as<br />\nHopkins lost the ball again before<br />\nit could put points on the board.<br />\nFinally, with just three<br />\nminutes remaining in the first<br />\nhalf, Hopkins began to put<br />\ntogether a scoring drive. Taking<br />\nadvantage of a Hoya punt<br />\nblocked and recovered by<br />\nfreshman defensive standout<br />\nTodd Deiterich, the Blue Jays<br />\nmoved eleven yards in three plays<br />\nbefore quarterback Jim Margraff<br />\nhit freshman John Potthast with<br />\na touchdown pass, in the<br />\nendzone. Jeff Harris provided the<br />\nextra point, bringing the score to<br />\n21-7 with just two minutes to<br />\nplay.<br />\nBy carefully utilizing their<br />\nremaining time-outs, the Blue<br />\nJays regained possession of the<br />\nball at midfield with 54 seconds<br />\nleft in the half. Four plays and<br />\ntwo Hoya penalties later Hopkins<br />\nscored again, as Margraff<br />\nconnected with Potthast for<br />\nanother Blue Jay six. Harris'<br /><br />\nextra point left it 21-14 in the<br />\nfirst half.<br />\nIn the second half Georgetown<br />\nbegan to pull away, as Sitz<br />\nengineered a pair of<br />\ntime-consuming touchdown<br />\ndrives on the Hoyas' first two<br />\npossessions. But Hopkins'<br />\ndefense came alive again. With<br />\nthe Hoyas ahead 35-14 late in the<br />\nthird period, freshman Selwin<br />\nVickers recovered a bobbled<br />\nquarterback option pitch-out at<br />\nthe Georgetown 18 yard line to<br />\nset up another Blue Jay score, an<br />\n8-yard scramble by running back<br />\nKenny Bess. Harris' extra point<br />\nattempt failed, leaving the Blue<br />\nJays 15 points behind as the final<br />\nperiod began.<br />\nAfter a quick exchange of<br />\npunts, the Hoyas began to eat at<br />\nthe clock. They spent a full ten<br />\nminutes on a 19-play drive which<br />\nresulted in Georgetown's final<br />\ncont. on p. 22<br /><br />\nKicker Jeff Harris displays fine form<br /><br />\nBooters Blank Two<br />\nBY CAROL HUBER<br />\nThe Hopkins soccer team has<br />\nturned its season around, blitzing<br />\nthrough three of its last four<br />\ngames including a 3-0 shut-out<br />\nover Widener on Wednesday. The Blue Jays completely<br />\ndominated the first half, taking<br />\nan amazing 21 shots on goal.<br />\nJunior Marty Wolf led the attack<br />\nwith 5 shots; he was helped by<br />\nChaim Levin and Lucien Brush.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThe Jays' first goal came midway<br />\nthrough the first half when Levin<br />\ntook a rebound off the goal post<br />\nand headed it up and into the<br />\nupper right-hand corner of the<br />\nWidener net.<br />\nSecond half action was more<br />\nevenly matched, with many<br />\nmid-field ball exchanges and few<br />\nstrong offensive drives. Brush<br />\nscored off a direct kick from 10<br />\nyards out and then scored again<br />\nminutes later on a short shot<br />\nwhich slipped past the Widener<br />\ngoalie. The Blue Jay backfied of<br />\nKen Suesse, Steve Galloway, and<br />\nJohn Triscoli did a fine job of<br />\ncontaining the Pioneer front line.<br />\nThis win followed up<br />\nSaturday's 1-0 shut-out of a<br />\nwell-skilled Franklin and<br />\nMarhshall team. Although both<br />\nteams had several scoring<br />\nopportunities in the first half,<br />\nneither was able to capitalize.<br />\nHopkins was unable to beat<br />\nF&amp;M's close one-on-one defense<br />\nuntil midway through the second<br />\nhalf, when Levin scored on an<br />\nassist by Captain Bobby Teasdall,<br />\nheading the ball into the goal<br />\nfrom 12 yards out.<br />\nBefore losing 5-0 to an<br /><br />\nexcellent Division II Loyola<br />\nteam, Hopkins captured another<br />\nbig league victory over<br />\nSwarthmore, coming up with<br />\nthree goals. Marty Wolf, Bobby<br />\nTeasdall, and Ed Vance nearly<br />\nscored on several occasions<br />\nduring the first half, but<br />\nSwarthmore jumped into the lead<br />\nby beating goalie Ken Suesse one<br />\ntime.<br />\nIn the second half the Blue Jay<br />\ndefense of Suesse, Triscoli and<br />\nGalloway held tight, keeping the<br />\nball out of scoring- range.<br />\nSuddenly, Levin took a pass from<br />\nTeasdall, went one-on-one with<br />\nthe goalie and beat him out to tie<br />\nthe score at 1-1. Minutes later,<br />\nEd Vance gained possession of a<br />\nloose ball after a corner kick and<br />\neasily scored the winning goal.<br />\nVance also tallied the final goal<br />\nof the game, taking a long lead<br />\npass from Marty Wolf,booting<br />\nthe ball into the upper left hand<br />\ncorner of the net.

The film, called<br />\n\"Baltimore on the Move,\" was<br />\nshown by Jay Brodie, director of<br />\nthe department, before his talk at<br />\nthe Sunday Experience October<br />\n22nd in the Listening-Viewing<br />\nRoom.<br />\nThe film was produced to sell<br />\nBaltimore to prospective<br />\nresidents and businesses. It tells<br />\nabout Baltimore's recent<br />\nadvances in housing<br />\ndevelopments, and in the<br />\nattraction of business to Charles<br />\nCenter and other areas. These<br />\nadvances have given Baltimore an<br />\n\"international reputation in<br />\ndevelopment.\"<br />\nMr. Brodie discussed how \"the<br />\nstrain of anti-urbanism in<br />\nAmerican life\" has contributed<br />\nto the flight of business and<br />\nmiddle and upper-income people<br />\nfrom American cities, including<br />\nBaltimore. ln the past, when<br />\nwealthier people moved outside<br />\nthe bounds of the city, Baltimore<br />\nwould annex the newly-inhabited<br />\nareas to preserve its tax base.<br />\nThus, Roland Park was absorbed<br />\nby the City in 1919. At that time<br />\nthe residents had no say in the<br />\nprocess, but since World War II<br />\nthey must approve any<br />\nannexation. According to Brodie,<br /><br />\nwith Baltimore's high tax rates,<br />\nresidents of a county will not do<br />\nthat. The result is a permanent<br />\nflight of relatively affluent<br />\npeople outside the city's fixed<br />\nboundaries, and an increasingly<br />\nhigh concentration of the elderly<br />\nand the poor people within the<br />\ncity, because they cannot afford<br />\nto live elsewhere. These are the<br />\npeople who are least able to pay<br />\ntaxes but require the most<br />\ngovernment services.<br />\nTo compensate for these<br />\nfinancial problems, Baltimore has<br />\ninstituted a property tax rate<br />\nabout twice as high as that in the<br />\ncounties. Faced with increasing<br />\nfiscal difficulties, the city has<br />\ntwo options: cut services, or<br />\nincrease revenue. The<br />\nDepartment of Housing and<br />\nCommunity Development's job is<br />\nto ensure the latter. One way to<br />\naugment the city's tax base is<br />\nthrough urban renewal that<br />\nbrings more taxpaying middle<br />\nincome people back to<br />\nBaltimore. The city currently has<br />\na homesteading program, in<br />\nwhich families can buy<br />\ndilapidated rowhouses at low<br />\nprices if they renovate the houses<br />\nwithin six months.<br />\nMany new housing<br />\ndevelopments are also being<br />\nbuilt Brodie noted that the city<br />\nis having equal difficulty<br />\nattracting either black or white<br />\nmiddle-income families to<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nBrodie said he was aware that<br />\nthese projects geneially ignore<br /><br />\npoor people, who are in<br />\ndesperate need of better housing<br />\nin Baltimore. But he said the city<br />\n\"cannot stress just low-income<br />\nhousing because that doesn't<br />\nbring in enough money like<br />\nmiddle-income housing.\"<br />\nBrodie claims the poverty<br />\nproblem cannot be helped by<br />\nhousing, but by jobs. He thinks<br />\ncity youths should be taught<br />\nmarketable skills in public<br />\nschools to facilitate their<br />\nemployment, something which is<br />\nnot currently being done. The<br />\nunemployment rate among black<br /><br />\nyouths is now 25 to 30%. The<br />\nnew white collar business now<br />\nbeing attracted to the city cannot<br />\nhelp them: \"The kind of entry<br />\njobs that existed for European<br />\nimmigrants 50 to 70 years ago do<br />\nnot exist anymore.\"<br />\nBrodie cited improvements<br />\nlike the new convention center<br />\nand subway, and an increase in<br />\nthe number of downtown<br />\nrestaurants. These are intended<br />\nto bring businessmen and tourists<br />\ninto the city. He stressed how<br />\nthese projects are only made<br />\npossible through the cooperation<br /><br />\nof government and business.<br />\nDespite the extra revenue<br />\ngenerated from these projects,<br />\nBrodie still thinks Baltimore will<br />\neventually be in financial trouble<br />\nwithout s Jme basic political<br />\nchange. He proposed the<br />\nabolition of local property taxes<br />\nand implementation of state-wide<br />\ngraduated taxes. Then Baltimore<br />\nwould have its current unevenly<br />\nhigh tax rate eliminated. Without<br />\nsome kind of change, he said,<br />\n\"that tax rate is going to kill us.\"<br /><br />\nTHE SENIOR CLASS FILM SERIES<br />\nPRESENTS...<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nTRUMAN CAPOTE'S<br /><br />\nIN COLD BLOOD<br />\n*STARRING*<br />\n*ROBERT*<br />\n*BLAKE*<br />\nFRIDAY &amp; SATURDAY<br /><br />\n\"One of the finest<br />\npictures of the year<br />\nand possibly ofthe<br />\ndecade.\"<br />\nSATURDAY REVIEW<br />\nSHAFFER 3<br /><br />\nOCTOBER 27 &amp; 2S<br /><br />\nADMISSION: $1.00<br /><br />\n7:30 &amp; 10:00 P.M.<br /><br />\nSENIORS: $ .75<br /><br />\nOct. 27 - Friday at Midnight $1.00<br />\nOct. 28 - Saturday at Midnight<br />\n$1.50 &amp; (costume contest)<br /><br />\nP.-1G1 8 V` OCTOBER\u201827; 1 978<br />\nmiles 300<br /><br />\nSouth African Black<br />\nUrges Divestment Step<br />\ncont. from p. 3<br />\nthe m ult in at onals.\" Rather,<br />\n:oreign investment supports the<br />\nexisting white dominance.

With policy the way it<br />\nis presently, students are made to<br />\nspread their use of the system<br />\nout over several days rather than<br />\nwaiting until the day before an<br />\nassignment is due and then<br />\nmaking a mad rush to get the<br />\nWork done. Furthermore, $4/day<br />\ncan go a fairly long way if some<br />\ncare is observed, such as working<br />\nduring non-prime-lime (in the<br />\nevenings or on the weekends).<br />\nI would also like to inform the<br />\nwriter that Dr. Bartels is<br />\nundoubtedly qualified to teach<br />\nthis course, having taught 24.63<br />\n(Computer Programming<br /><br />\nENOUGH<br />\nTO MAKE<br />\nYOU GLAD<br />\nYOU'RE<br />\nALIVE.<br />\nThere's great joy to be<br />\nfound in a Christian<br />\nScience church service.<br />\nIt comes from getting<br />\na clearer idea of God<br />\nas infinite good,and<br />\nof man as His image<br />\nand likeness.<br />\nIt comes from feeling<br />\nthe power of these<br />\nideas in each week's<br />\nLesson-Sermon, read<br />\nfrom the Bible and<br />\nfrom the Christian<br />\nScience textbook.<br />\nIt comes from seeing<br />\nwhat was hopeless<br />\nor painful in your<br />\nexperience replaced<br />\nby the certainty<br />\nof rod<br />\nYou can eave the<br />\nservice with a lighter<br />\nheart... and ready to<br />\ngladden others, too.<br /><br />\n4P<br /><br />\nCHRISTIAN SCIENCE<br />\nSUNDAY SERVICES<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nSunday Morning- 11 a.m.<br />\nSunday Evening- 7:30 p.m.<br />\nFIRST CHURCH OF<br />\nCHRIST, SCIENTIST<br />\n102 West University Pkwy.<br /><br />\nWorkshop) previously, among<br />\nother Math.Sci. courses.<br />\nAs regards the matter of<br />\nincreasing the workload, if it is<br />\ngenuinely excessive, it would<br />\nseem that this would be reflected<br />\nin the work of the class as a<br />\nwhole, and should not affect<br />\nindividual grades.

Most of us here at<br />\nHopkins spend our days in<br />\nintellectual pursuit quite<br />\noblivious of the people who keep<br />\nour buildings and grounds clean<br />\nand operational. It is easy to<br />\nforget them as they scurry about<br />\nquietly emptying trash, cleaning<br />\nfloors and restrooms. Their work<br />\nis consistently productive and<br />\nessential to the daily health and<br /><br />\nwell-being of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity (which is a good deal<br />\nmore than many of us can say),<br />\nyet they are often forgotten.<br />\nWell, now they can be forgotten<br />\nentirely. Because if you happen<br />\nto work a normal workday, say<br />\nanytime between eight in the<br />\nmorning and nine at night, you<br />\nneed never cast your eyes upon<br />\nthese .unappreciated members of<br />\nthe Hopkins community again. A<br />\nrecent change in policy now<br />\nrequires much of the custodial<br />\nstaff to work from eleven at<br />\nnight to seven in the morning.<br />\nWhy?<br />\nVic Zanella,<br />\nAccording to<br />\nmanager of housekeeping, the<br />\nchange of the night shift, \"while<br />\nan inconvenience to the people<br />\n(custodians), was well worth the<br />\ntradeoff in increased productivity<br />\nto be gained from night work.\"<br />\nHe went on to say that budget<br />\nrevisions necessitated the<br />\nchanging to the night shift. Of<br />\ncourse it is well and good for Mr.<br />\nZanella to speak of tradeoffs,<br />\nsince he has traded little in the<br />\nway of inconvenience to himself,<br />\ngaining everything in the way of<br />\nincreasing productivity from the<br />\ncustodial staff, who now work<br /><br />\nuninterrupted in the boredom of union representing the interests<br />\nsilent, dark, empty buildings.

We disliked each other's music, politics, study<br />\nhabits and brand of whisky, but whatever smacked ot<br />\nmerde du taureau to one produced an equal reaction in<br />\nthe other, and in that respect we might have been Siamese<br />\ntwins.Late autumn mornings, especially, the cramped and<br />\nchilly dorm room would reek with the offending stench,<br />\nfor it was then that I usually returned, swearing under my<br />\nbreath, from Contemporary American Letters.<br />\nLike most aspiring young authors, I came to this<br />\ncampus with certain ideas about writing, one being that it<br />\njust can't be taught...at least, not in a classroom. I also<br />\narrived, however, with a more or less open mind, and<br />\nquickly determined to give the Writing Seminars<br />\nDepartment a fair chance to change my way of thinking.<br />\nAccordingly, I shelved Intro Psycho for a year and<br />\npenciled in CAL in its stead.<br />\nI will not attempt to give anything resembling a full<br />\naccount of the atrocities perpetrated in that literary<br />\nchamber of horros, for I haven't nearly the stomach for it.<br />\nWhat I will do is relate a few of the more memorable<br />\ninstances, which should give the reader a fairly good idea<br />\nofjust what 22.5 (oh,innocent title!) was all about.<br />\nThe underlying principle of the class was that nothing<br />\nyou did, no matter how outrageous, was ever wrong.<br />\n(Being the product of a Jesuit education, this naturally<br />\nstruck me as damnable heresy from the very first). No<br />\nmatter what foul garbage was spewed out by the empty<br />\nminds of my classmates, it was instantly justified as being<br />\n\"creative\" and an \"honest expression of his/her inner<br />\nfeelings.\" No matter what imbecilic scribbling was daily<br />\nhanded in,. it always came back bearing the scarlet letter<br />\nand an impassioned request that it should be read aloud<br />\nso that all might hear and benefit. Our TA seemed<br />\nincapable of shaking her head to show even the slightest<br />\ntouch of disapproval no matter how incredible the offense<br />\nagainst common intelligence, and I began staring intently<br />\nat the back of that worthy's neck, trying to determine if<br />\nany tendons had been cut (I still believe a lobotomy is<br />\nrequired). Many were the times I was forced to bite my<br />\ntongue and sit on my writhing hands while listening to<br />\nsome malodorous tirade about God-knows-what, lest I<br />\nstrike out and bloody the offending mouth in my<br />\nrighteous rage.<br />\nI remember one gruesome incident in particular that to<br />\nthis day never fails to boggle and becloud my mind. It was<br />\ngetting near the end of the semester, and I was<br />\ndesperately hoping that the worst crimes were over and I<br />\ncould glide thiough December without losing my temper<br />\nor any more of my breakfasts. Gentle reader, it was not to<br />\nbe.<br />\nThe assignment for that day had been to \"explore an<br />\nunconventional aspect of literature that has a special<br />\nmeaning for you\" or some nonsense to that effect. Near<br />\nthe end of the interminable hour the time came for a<br />\nparticularly airheaded female to give her presentation.<br />\nNow, from past experience I was fearing the worst, but<br />\nher performance that day easily left my wildest .<br />\nnightmares in the dust. She sat there (oh, I remember it<br />\nwell!) straight of face, steady of voice, and proceeded to'<br />\nread a poem... backwards. She announced weightily to the<br />\nroom at large that she was proving \"that poems can be<br />\njust as meaningful and valid when read in reverse.\"<br />\nI whipped my head around and gazed imploringly into<br />\nthe TA's face. Surely this was too much, even for her;<br />\nsurely this lastest and greatest outrage would bring her to<br /><br />\nher long forgotten senses! But to my consternation, to my<br />\nhorror; all I beheld was that same approving smile and the<br />\nsame benign head bobbing up and down with a cheery<br />\nvigour, if anything more empathic than usual!<br />\nOH! PROPHETESS OF THE NEW LITERARY AGE!<br />\nOh revealer of the ONE TRUE CRITICISM! No airhead<br />\nshe, but rather a VOICE OF TRUTH RINGING OUT OF<br />\nTHE DARK NESS! Away with meter and meaning and all<br />\nthe rest of the ancient lies which have blinded us to<br />\npoetry's true soul! The Eternal Circle is<br />\ncompleted...foreward they were written and BACK WARD<br />\nTHEY SHALL BE READ!<br />\nOh why, WHY didn't I see it all before? It's so simple<br />\nand yet so right! Consider Tennyson's Ulysses, just as an<br />\nexample : For years, people have been reading the last<br />\nlines as...<br />\nTo strive,<br />\nTo seek,<br />\nTo find,<br />\nAnd not to yield!<br /><br />\nFor the most part they travel (like all stupid and<br />\ncowardly animals do) in packs. Without constant<br />\nreassurance from others of their own kind that the Nobel<br />\nPrize is near at hand, their whole house of self-important<br />\ncards would crumble and blow away like the pages of so<br />\nmany Classic Comics. Needless to say, I usually give such<br />\ngibbering flocks a wide berth, but there always arise those<br />\nvexing times when a confrontation becomes inevitable.<br />\nOne night last Spring, for instance, found me and another<br />\nlusty English major in the Baker abode of a sprightly New<br />\nJersey nymph (that's nymph, not nympho) when<br />\nsuddenly the door burst open and half a dozen of the<br /><br />\naudie:<br />\nTurni<br /><br />\nYou<br /><br />\nanswc<br />\nit ech<br />\nand s<br />\nfloor.<br /><br />\nHo<br />\nthe oi<br /><br />\n7<br />\n,<br />\n,<br /><br />\n,,,-)j.. ,-.- ..,*\u20221,<br />\n. .'<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n...how vague, stilted, and stuffy; how enormously<br />\ninferior that sounds when compared to the new<br />\nreading...the glorious new REVERSED READING!...<br /><br />\nez.\\<br /><br />\n\u2022\":-'<br />\n- 1<br />\n.,.. 4<br />\n.<br /><br />\n...k-'7.<br /><br />\n..,<br />\nf ...t)<br />\n..<br />\n\u2022<br />\n,<br /><br />\n.4 . ,. .<br /><br />\n:.\u2022<br />\n\u2022,.1. i<br /><br />\n,\u2022<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n,..f .<br />\n\u2022<br />\nHit s i '<br />\n'<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\n.,<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\n/1\",<br /><br />\n_. ..<br />\n\u2022,,,,:::.<br />\n\u2022 \\.,<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1.,<br /><br />\n.. .<br /><br />\n..<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n..\u2022..<br />\n.<br />\n.<br /><br />\n1<br />\n--.,. - -es<br />\n...<br />\nAr -<br /><br />\n.<br />\nI-ir.:1<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n....<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nDole and mete I, wife aged and with match'd<br />\nCrags barren these among, hearth still this by<br />\nKing idle an that profits little it.<br />\n%ist-high bullshit, you say'?...son, I was hangin' from the<br />\nrafters.<br />\nI certainly don't want to give anyone the impression<br />\nthat I think all students in the Writing Seminars to be<br />\nliterary clowns on the order of the one mentioned above.<br />\nOne of the first things instilled by a quality liberal<br />\neducation is a fear of sweeping generalizations, and I've<br />\nbeen paying attention in class.

The Bard had spoken. Being a kind<br />\nphilosopher-king, however, he was willing to humor his<br />\naudience by pretending to ask their opinions as well.<br />\nTurning to my friend and I, he inquireu gravely \"How do<br />\nYou fellows deal with cohesiveness?\" My associate<br />\nanswered by breaking wind with such a cruel ferocity that<br />\nit echoed down the deserted halls, shook the dewy panes,<br />\nand sent a cup of cappuchino instantly crashing to the<br />\nfloor.<br />\nHow else are you gonna deal with these people?...it's<br />\nthe only language they really understand.<br /><br />\nOccasionally some of these feather-headed charlatans<br />\nWill have the audacity to show their faces in an English<br />\nclass and presume to discuss literature among serious<br />\ndisciples of the craft. The results are always distressing.<br />\nThe most amazing thing about their opinions on the<br />\nsubject is not that they are ludicrous (which they most<br />\ncertainly are) out that they are identical from ;I<br />\nhack. It never ceases to amaze me how such a s.z.able<br />\ngroup of mostluito-brains are drawn only to literature's<br />\nporch light...wily don't they buzz around somebody else<br />\nfor Christsake? And, like mosquitoes, they all make<br />\nexactly the same noise. Stated briefly,the party line is as<br />\nfollows : We are now privileged to live in a literary Golden<br />\nAge, where page after page of sublime pencraft need only<br />\nto be plucked from the gently rocking boughs of New<br />\nArcadia. Scribes of worth abound these days as never<br />\nbefore, and all one need to do is close his eyes, shut off<br />\nhis brain, put pen to paper, and wait to join the rank.; 9f<br /><br />\nthe Immortals of prose and poetry. All which came before<br />\nwas mere prologue--just cave-paintings, really, when<br />\ncompared to what modern author-deities, local and<br />\notherwise, now offer to a grateful public (This public,<br />\nincidentally, has no more fervant wish, it seems, than to<br />\nperuse the creative efforts of undergraduates).<br />\nSuch is the philosophy of the Writing Department's<br />\nenfants terribles, and such is. the manure which is shoved<br />\ninto our faces when these creatures invade English classes.<br />\nAs I've said, the Past for them is dead. Consequently,<br />\nwhen discussing an author of old, they do not weigh his<br />\nmerits and weaknesses, rather they merely dismiss him.<br />\nSome examples, I think, will amply suffice:<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDickens--A clever fellow, but his dialogues are stiff.<br />\nShakespeare--Quite good for a homosexual.<br />\nTennyson-- a jingoist.<br />\nDonne--\"Who?\"<br />\nCrane--A warmonger. Same goes for Hemingway.<br />\n...and so forth. Thrice an hour I have heard<br />\ncomments on Hamlet that would make old Bill turn over<br />\nin his grave. If there are more such writing students at<br />\nother universities, the ground at Stratford must be very<br />\nunquiet indeed, for the honored playwright is surely<br />\ntwirling at a furious rate.<br />\nTheir verbiage is laced with tell-tale words which<br />\nimmediately alert the enlightened members of the class<br />\nto their presence. Gems like \"cosmic,\" \"intense,\"<br />\n\"relate,\" and \"existential\" are always in abundant supply,<br />\nbeing plugged into their ramblings to cover the unsightly<br />\nholes where the thoughts should have gone. Now,English<br />\nmajors are by and large a tolerant lot--slow to anger and<br />\nopen in outlook, but, like anyone else, we can be pushed<br />\ntoo far. So, when one of these irritating empty helmets<br />\nruns amok and begins to waste too much of our time, we<br />\nare forced to assume the role of The Enforcer. We don't<br />\nlike to, you understand it's quite distasteful to us, but<br />\nsooner or later the pissants must be squelched. Once the<br />\ndecision is made to use The Enforcer, justice is swift.<br />\nTake, for example, a discussion of The Sun Also Rises.<br />\nAirhead : If you want my opinion, I don't see why we're<br />\nreading this book at all. I think any so-called novel about<br />\nsome macho bully-boy completely devoid of feelings is<br />\njust invalid, and I can't get in touch with his...<br />\nThe Enforcer: What about the very moving passage on<br />\npage 49 at the bottom, where he confesses his love for<br />\nBrett and admits he's afraid of the dark?<br />\nAirhead : Well, I don't really want to argue about such a...<br />\nThe Enforcer: That's page 49, the one right before 50,<br />\nwhy don't we take a look?<br />\nAirhead: Well, now that you mention it, there might be<br />\nsome existentialist aspects worth...<br />\nThe Enforcer: And that's another thing. I confess to being<br />\nquite uninformed about the existentialists' movement.<br />\nWould you please summarize it for me?<br />\nAirhead: I'm...uh...sure we wouldn't...uh...I mean...<br />\nThe Enforcer: Then, at least, list some novels for us that<br />\nyou don't consider to be existentialist.<br />\nAirhead :Please...I...don't feel very well...please...Oh God<br />\nNeedless to say, from now on a mere sidelong glance<br />\nfrom<br />\nThe Enforcer's direction is enough to stifle a<br />\ndozen such clowns. It's like Bacardi One-Fifty-One:<br />\npainful, but it gets the job done.<br />\nThe worst of it, by far, is their writing. Or as they<br />\nprefer to put it, their writing. As for the short stories,<br /><br />\nthey are always too long. (This can be attributed to the<br />\nfact that they put you to sleep after the first page rather<br />\nthan to their actual length) If they can be said to have a<br />\ngeneral theme at all, it is this: Life is meaningless. Almost<br />\ninvariably they are about some derelict or pervert or<br />\ncripple who goes from bad to wretched due to the evil<br />\nmachinations of a malignant force over which he has<br />\nabsolutely no control. The major characters, if there are<br />\nany, show no intelligence, spontaneity, or humanity, and<br />\nbear little resemblance to creatures of this world. They<br />\nare not people so much as animate dung-heaps. Those are<br />\nthe better variety. In the rest, nothing of any interest<br />\noccurs. People eat breakfast, or stare out of a tenement<br />\nwindow, or sunbathe, or perform some equally mundane<br />\ntask until we are brought, in eager anticipation, to the<br />\nshattering, electrifying climax which always reads : The<br />\nEnd.<br />\nI've lost patience with these sad philosophers. If, after<br />\nreading one of their doleful tales, I picked up the Morning<br />\nSun and read of their attempted suicide, I might at least<br />\nbelieve in their sincerity if not their craft. As it stands,<br />\nhowever, these same somber sages are to be seen reveling<br />\namong the foremost Disco Night regulars and laughing<br />\njust as loudly and frequently as any of their \"less<br />\nhardened\" classmates ambling across the quads. The truth<br />\nis obvious--they write of hopelessness without knowing<br />\nanything of its true cost. They write of bitterness because<br />\nthey believe that all writers worth their salt are expected<br />\nto be bitter. Their \"deep sadness\" over the human<br />\ncondition springs not from a conviction, but rather from<br />\nfashion. They wear despair like a Halloween costume, and<br />\nunderstandably, we fail to be frightened.<br />\nJ ust as the theme of these stories have been wrought<br />\nwithout conflict, characterization, or plot; so too the<br />\nstructure is devoid of syntax, punctuation, or form. There<br />\nseems to be among them a great, burning desire to be<br />\noriginal. My beef is that it has been obtained at the<br />\nexpense of quality. As Truman Capote once said, \"It's not<br />\nwriting, it's just typing.\"<br />\nIs this sad situation really the fault of the Writing<br />\nSeminars Department? To be honest, I really can't say for<br />\nsure. After Contemporary American Letters, I withdrew<br />\nall my efforts from that area like a hand recoiling from a<br />\nwhite-hot flame. That CAL type of \"instruction,\"<br />\nhowever, has cropped up before me again from time to<br />\n. time. A young lady once pulled the poems she was writing<br />\nfor class out of a drawer and eagerly begged my opinion.<br />\nShe said that her TA was quite proud of the work, but<br />\nsuggested that she \"stop thinking and concentrate on<br />\nimagery.\" Stop thinking--sage advice for anyone who<br />\nwants to pass CAL. Advice which I fear too many in that<br />\nmajor have brought with them to the more rewarding<br />\nadvanced courses.<br />\nBy now, I must appear as some pint-sized academic<br />\nreactionary, opposed to all change and fearful of any<br />\ninnovation. I sincerely hope that isn't the case--but the<br />\nman who constantly sees the barbarians sharpening their<br />\nspears outside the city walls has understandably little<br />\npatience for talk of leniency toward them in the Senate<br />\nChamber. Perhaps I'm angry because so little of the really<br />\ngood creative writing on this campus finds its way to the<br />\nFeatures desk; perhaps I wrote this polemic because I'm<br />\njust jealous of my more worthy competitors; maybe my<br />\nextreme views spring from insecurity. Perhaps...but I<br />\nreally think the truth is simply that, like Joel happen to<br />\nhave a sensitive nose.<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 I OCTOBER 27, 1978<br /><br />\nHigh Rollers Find Paradise In Jersey<br />\nby Ozurd D.<br />\nNew Jersey, Land of the Rising Odor and Lowering<br />\nMoral. I am, I almost ashamedly admit, from a small town<br />\nof approximately 20,000 primarily comatose citizens in<br />\nCentral Jersey. From the brown skies of Bayonne to the<br />\neven more brown waters of Barnegat Bay, New Jersey<br />\nprovides little in the way of redeeming social, cultural or<br />\nintellectual value. I've always been a gambler, however,<br />\nand that perhaps explains why I still take a chance in<br />\nletting my lungs breathe what New Jersey dares to call air.<br />\nBetting has always been a part of my life--from almost<br />\ndaily nickel-dime poker games at my house from about<br />\nthe eighth grade on, to playing blackjack on the sly in my<br />\nCatholic high school, to finally betting with an older<br />\nbrother as to whether or not my little brother will<br />\ngraduate from that same high school (my hundred dollars<br />\nsays the little nipper walks away with the sheepskin).<br />\nReligion, too, has been a gamble for me recently. I won<br />\n$25 on John Paul I. but lost $100 on the remake. The<br />\nLord does indeed work in mysterious (and<br />\nsometimes,costly) ways. In any event, imagine my delight<br />\nwhen the Casino Referendum passed in New Jersey! Now,<br />\nat last, only an hour and a half south on the Garden State<br />\nParkway was the world of craps, blackjack, roulette, fast<br />\nwomen, easy fortune, and lost paychecks; in a word, a<br />\ngambler's paradise. Atlantic City, once thought to be a<br />\ndecaying metropolis, was magically transformed into a<br />\ndecaying metropolis with a casino.<br />\nNatually I had to go. Sure I couldn't afford it, but that<br />\ndidn't stop me. The gambler's mind is fundamentally<br />\nirrational. Questions like \"how am I going to pay for gas<br />\nand tolls?' and \"how am I going to eat next week?\" are<br />\nconveniently ignored.ln mid-June I made my first trip to<br />\nthe Resorts International Casino with my oldest brother.<br />\nThe casino is large ard visually impressive, about the size<br />\nof a football field. The carpeting is thick, orange and<br />\nbrown. The ceiling is covered with an array of<br />\nbubble-shaped objects which conceal cameras used to<br />\ndetect cheaters, both patrons and employees. There are<br />\nsix ways to throw your money away in Atlantic City:<br />\ncraps, roulette, baccarat, blackjack, big six (a<br />\ncarnival-type wheel which pays from even money to 40:1),<br />\nand slot machines. Minimum bets at blackjack are $2,<br />\nmaximum, $3000. Other than knowing that the minimum<br />\nbet at baccarat is $20, I don't know limits for other<br />\ngames, as blackjack is all I play. The casino takes an<br />\naverage of slightly over $18/hour per bettor at the other<br />\ngames. It was very crowded my first trip, as Resorts was<br />\nand still is the only game in town. Waits of three hours or<br />\nmore for a seat were not uncommon throughout the<br />\nsummer.<br />\nMy brother bankrolled me that first trip, and I won<br />\n$90. Not bad, I thought for my first time out with the big<br /><br />\nboys. I walked around a bit, just observing my fellow<br />\ninmates in the asylum. There's a preponderance of old<br />\nladies at the slots, and they tend to become attached to<br />\ntheir machines, screaming in near-orgasmic frenzy when<br />\nthey win big, and who reluctantly,disgustedly slip away<br />\nwhen the machine has taken the last of their coins. Craps<br />\nplayers are typically loud and jumpy, cigars or cigarettes<br />\nnervously dangling from their mouths. Blackjack players<br />\n(myself included) tend to be obsessive, constantly playing<br />\nwith their chips, not-so-silently-cussing when the dealer<br />\nhas gotten his/her fifth 21 in a row. Baccarat players are<br />\nthe \"elite\" of the casino, having a very plush room to<br /><br />\nthemselves roped off on the side.<br />\nI made a few more trips to Resorts over the summer,<br />\nstill unable to afford it. Through hard work and bad luck<br />\nI was able to give back the $90, plus $15 to boot. Oh<br />\nwell, at least drinks are free when you're gambling.<br />\nThey're also very strong, the theory being drunk gamblers<br />\nare a whole lot more reckless than sober ones. Casino<br />\nhours are 10:00 am-,6:00 am Friday and Saturday. The<br />\ncasino also requires men to wear jackets after six pin. I<br />\npresume they want losers to at least look presentable<br />\nwhen they're contemplating suicide after they've lost the<br />\nmoney for their wife's operation. One night a few blocks<br /><br />\nfrom the casino, after the casino had already closed, my<br />\nfriend was offered twenty dollars for his jacket by<br />\nsomeone rushing to get his last bets down. Unfortunately<br />\nthe jacket was worth more than twenty dollars.<br />\nIn early August, due to my having good enough sense<br />\nto sue two of my brothers when the opportunity<br />\npresented itself, I became a member of the nouveau riche.<br />\nShortly thereafter, I went back to the casino, this time<br />\nplaying at the $25 table. I was determined to either make<br />\nor lose $500. I travelled home that day with only one<br />\nbulge in my pants. I made no more trips to Resorts before<br />\nschool started. Here I discovered Atlantic City is easily<br />\nreached by taking route 95 to the Delaware Memorial<br />\nBridge, then just over the bridge take U.S. 40 east straight<br />\ninto Atlantic City. Time: approximately three hours. AtialP<br />\n)<br />\nthe end of September, I made a pit-stop there with my<br />\nroommate and girlfriend on my way home for the<br />\nweekend. My girlfriend got pinched and propositioned by<br />\none of a group of five Puerto Ricans. I won $630. All in<br />\nall, we both did well.<br />\nFiguring I had Resort's number, I went back last week.<br />\nI didn't quite have their number. I was down $400 an<br />\nhour before we left. I managed to get it back, plus $750,<br />\nbut it was close. A strange thing happened, though, that<br />\nday. The $100 table was right behind me and all of a<br />\nsudden a man started a loud argument with the dealer. He<br />\nclaimed that he had not been paid on two successive<br />\nhands. The pit boss was called over. The man was<br />\nadamant,claiming he had been cheated. The manager was<br />\ncalled over, and asked the man how much he wanted. He<br />\nsaid $4000. The manager immediately wrote out a check<br />\nfor that amount, and gave it to him. I was at first<br />\nsurprised by this, but then realized the guy was going to<br />\nlose it right back, so Resorts wasn't going to lost<br />\nanything; it was also good public relations. The only other<br />\nunusual thing to happen that day was that my girlfriend<br />\nwas propositioned again, this time by a guy who was<br />\nplaying at the same table with me. Oh lucky girl!<br />\nHowever, he was a big loser, and I'm the only loser she'll<br />\ntolerate.<br />\nThe last trip I overheard some U of Penn. students who<br />\ntermed the casino \"U. of Penn. east.\" It then hit me that<br />\nit's a great idea for all Hopkins students to go to the<br />\ncasino. If you win, great! The money is essentially<br />\ntax-free (you don't report it); literally you have made out<br />\nlike a bandit. If you lose, just come back to Homewood,<br />\ngo to the Financial Aid Office, tell them you're broke,and<br />\nthey'll give you grants and work-study. You can't lose<br />\neither way. Maybe Papa Stevie would rent a bus for us. In<br />\nany event,/V be at Resorts tomorrow.<br /><br />\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<br /><br />\n* Gays Say Nix To Prop Six *<br />\nSan Diego, Ca.(CPS) -- As the limousine pulls into view,<br />\nthe crowd of demonstrators that had gathered at the<br />\nentrance to San Diego's Town and Country Hotel begins<br />\nto shout and jeer:<br />\n\"Two, Four, Six, Three/We're the Queers From<br />\nUCSD.\"<br />\nThe car stops at the curb, and John Briggs, the<br />\nlock-jawed, crew-cut state senator from Orange County,<br />\nsteps out.<br />\nSuddenly, a slender young man wearing nail polish and<br />\nan earring breaks through the line of hotel security people<br />\nto confront Briggs. The protester is immediately arrested<br />\nafter the two exchange epithets. Three others are<br />\nultimately arrested in the protest against Briggs and the<br />\nanti-gay California.initiative, he authored for the state's<br />\nNovember ballot.<br />\nThe initiative is popularly. called the Briggs Initiative,<br />\nand formally known as Proposition 6's proponents reason<br />\nin a fund-raising letter written by the Butcher-Ford<br />\nagercy -- the same firm that managed the Proposition 13<br />\ncampaign in the state last June -- that since the rest of the<br />\nnation looks to California for change and fashion, \"We're<br />\ngoing to show them that morality is back in style.\"<br />\nThis campaign, of course, is only the latest<br />\nanti-homosexual political movement. In every vote thus<br />\nfar -- in Wichita, St. Paul, and Eugene, Oregon -- gay rights<br />\nactivists have met defeat.<br />\nThey may well be headed for another defeat in<br />\nCalifornia.<br />\nSponsor Briggs, who claims to<br />\nhave had a personal experience with Jesus Christ,<br />\nhas been in a leadership position of many anti-gay<br />\ncampaigns since first serving as a volunteer in<br /><br />\nAnita Bryant's crusade in Dade County, Florida.<br />\nNot coincidentally, many observers see some<br />\n1000 evangelical and fundamentalist churches<br />\nserving as the back bone of his California support<br />\nas well.<br />\nYet he also has a fair amount of support from the<br />\nstate's -healthy conservative forces. It was, in fact, his<br />\nentry into the state Republican gubernatorial primary as a<br />\nconservative leader that motivated Proposition 6 in the<br />\nfirst place.<br />\nTo increase his state-wide name identification, Briggs<br />\nstarted two petition drives to get measures on the ballot.<br />\nThe anti-homosexuality measure was the first. The<br />\nsecond, a proposal to make the death penalty cover more<br />\nkinds of crimes, is now Proposition 7 on the November<br />\nballot.<br />\nHe got them on the ballot by raising $1 million for his<br />\ncommittee, Californians To Defend Our Children. The<br />\ncommittee, in turn, hired a professional campaign firm to<br />\ncollect signatures at 50 cents each.<br />\nThe anti-homosexuality campaign is relying on<br />\ntelevision commercials, some of which feature photos of<br />\nthe Houston boys killed several years ago by homosexual<br />\nDean Allen Corill. There are also photos of the victims of<br />\nCalifornia's homosexual trash bag murders being dug up.<br />\nYet the measure these ads promote is somewhat vague<br />\nin wording. Its opponents fear it would sanction the firing<br />\nof teachers for simply telling their students that Spartan<br />\nGreece was a gay culture.

A Doll's Muse has long been recognized as<br />\none of the most controversial plays dealing with the role<br />\nof women in society and at home. It was one of the<br />\nearliest pieces of literature which dealt with the issue of<br />\nwhether or not women were capable of taking an equal<br />\nstand in society.<br />\nA )In House clearly brings to the surface many of<br />\nthe issu s involved in controversies between men an 1<br />\nwomen.

All are de: ,s h<br />\nthe course of this play.<br />\nlbsen's personal views on feminism are never stated in<br />\nthis play; he takes no stand, but portrays both men and<br />\nwomen in a ridiculous light at times. However, at the time<br />\nthe play was written (1879), the mere recognition aid<br />\nverbalization of the unequal treatment of women s-as<br />\nenough to label a person a feminist for life. Ibsen sticeti<br />\nafterward that he was not a feminist, but that he %Arai<br />\nsimply trying to accurately portray the current attitu le<br />\ntoward women; still, he was outcast from literary circles<br />\nand his plays were sometimes banned.<br />\nIn a modern light, A Doll k house seems not only mild,<br />\nbut practically anti-feminist. The heroine, Niqa. is a<br />\ncont. on p. 18<br /><br />\nThis weekend, there will be midnight showings of The<br />\nRocky Horror Picture Show, a film whose popularity has<br />\nswept the country this summer. It is a rock musical about<br />\na transvestite from outerspace, and a parody of the old<br />\n'grade-B' science fiction movies like Tarantula and Night<br />\nof the Living Dead. But more than a movie, it has caused<br />\nthe evolution ,of a cultural phenomenon, the 'Rocky<br />\nHorror Picture Show' cult.<br />\nPerhaps the birthplace of the 'Rocky' cult was at the<br />\nWaverly Theater in Greenwich Village where it played<br />\nevery Friday and Saturday night at midnight for 31<br />\n/<br />\n2 years.<br />\nAt first, only a few people would see it more than once or<br />\ntwice, but gradually this accelerated to the point where<br />\npeople would see it forty and fifty times.Of course,<br />\nnobody could sit through the same movie that many<br />\ntimes without having it affect them, and without they<br />\naffecting it.<br />\nCertain rituals began to develop. For example,<br />\ninterjecting lines at key places in the film: Frank--I see<br />\nyou shiver with antici-... (pause) Audience--Say it!<br />\nFrank\u2014pation! In the next stage of development, the<br />\naudience began to bring props: rice for the wedding scene;<br />\ntoast for when one is proposed at the dinner. At this<br />\npoint, the popularity of The Rocky Horror Picture Show<br />\nbegan to spread throughout the East Coast, primarily in<br />\ncollege communities. Finally however, in New York, the<br />\nfilm reached a point of stagnation, and after over three<br />\nyears it closed.<br />\nHow can the popularity of The Rocky Horror Picture<br />\nShow be accounted for?

For some, the concert is merely<br />\nthe playing of their albums live, before an audience--it's<br />\nlike watching a record. For others, the live performance is<br />\na totally different experience. The concert captures the<br />\nauditory aspect that is part of the studio album, but it<br />\nadds another--the visual--dimension. Thus, the importance<br />\nof a concert is not just to hear the music performed, but<br />\nto see it performed. On a studio album, a listener can't see<br />\nMick Jagger strutting around, or Pete Townshend leaping<br />\nin the air and Roger Daltry swinging his mike; one can't<br />\nn see the lasers, dry ice and elaborate backdrops that<br />\nt bands use in concert. This visual element is the<br />\nprimary thing that differentiates a band in concert from a<br />\nband on record,<br />\nThe question then arises as to the motives for taking a<br />\nconcert, with all its additional visuality, and putting it<br />\nback on record. The live album is an interesting yet<br />\ndisturbing phenomenon in rock music. The album<br />\neliminates the visual element which is so important in a<br />\nlive performance, and records only the auditory part. The<br />\nlive album defeats the major purpose behind the live<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nperformance. Ideally, the only way a live/albuni could be<br />\nconsidered a success would be if it captured the auditory<br />\naspect so well that the listener \"feels\" he is seeing it.<br />\nOtherwise the live album is essentially worthless without<br />\nthe visual elements.<br />\nUnfortunately, it is extremely rare that an album can<br />\nrecord the live \"feel\" of the music, and make the listener<br />\n\"see\" the concert. The Who Live At Leeds is the greatest<br />\nexample of this ideal live album. One can't see the stage<br />\nantics of The Who, but more than on any other live<br />\nalbum, one can truly get a vivid feel for the visual<br />\nelements of the concert. The greatest selling live album,<br />\nFrampton Comes Alive, is a good album, but it sounds<br />\nlike nothing more than a studio album with audience<br />\nresponses tracked in throughout the songs. Conceptually,<br />\nthe most inventive live album is Running on Empty by<br />\nJackson Browne. He recorded a live album with entirely<br />\nnew compositions about live performances and being on<br />\nthe road. Although the songs occasionally digress into<br />\nself-indulgent introspection like on earlier albums,<br />\nBrowne's concept is so unique that it can never be<br />\nduplicated without being called an imitation. But the<br />\nessence of most live albums is to try to capture as well as<br />\nIIY VINAY LAL<br />\nMadame Rosa is adapted from the script of Momo, a<br />\nel by Emile Ajar. Unlike the novel, which is said to<br />\ne focused on the boy Momo, the movie concentrates<br />\non Madame Rosa. This is one of the great failings of<br />\nMadame Rosa.<br />\nThe movie was directed in Paris by Moshe Mizrahi. The<br />\nsetting is a Jewish ghetto in Paris. Madame Rosa (Simon<br />\nSignore\u00b0 is an aged and' ailing Jewish lady, a former<br />\nprostitute, running an orphanage for the children of<br />\nprostitutes. In spite of her sordid past, she. tries to raise<br />\nthe children 'straight', a seemingly impossible task. Her<br />\nparticular favorite among her wards is Momo, who she<br />\nkeeps in the da;'; about his age for fear that he may<br />\nabandon her.<br />\nMadame Rosa is an \"implacably humane and<br />\ncourageous\" woman (more appropriately a whore) who,<br />\nas film critic Robert Hatch said, \"is a vehicle for Simone<br />\nSignoret's formidable repertory of histrionics.\" She is, to<br />\nbe precise, disgusting; even Momo, her faithful angel,<br />\nadmits so at one point. Madame Rosa's ugliness<br />\novercomes any good points the movie may have.<br />\nMizrahi occasionally (and unsuccessfully) attempts to<br />\nadd touches of light comedy to this essentially morbid<br />\nfilm. Although Madame Rosa is Jewish, Momo has been<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\npossible the auditory aspect of a concert, and to try to<br />\nrelate that musically to the visual aspect. This is<br />\nextremely difficult, and it is rare that a live album<br />\nsufficiently achieves this ideal.<br />\nGranted, live albums do a poor job of capturing the live<br />\nperformances, but groups continue to release them<br />\nnonetheless. The motives behind a live album are not<br />\nalways idealistic. The most obvious ulterior motive is<br />\nmaterialistic: since groups are expected to perform live,<br />\nthere is little expense involved in recording a concert and<br />\nputting out an album, thus increasing sales and profits.<br />\nYet, on inspection of five recently released live albums,<br />\nthe apparent motives seem hardly as crude, and much<br />\nmore interesting and complex.<br />\nThe motives behind the live Crack the Sky album Live<br />\nSky are rather desperate. It has been about a year since<br />\nthe release of SaPty In Numbers for which the group<br />\ngained national popularity. John Palumbo,<br />\nleader/guitarist/I cad vocalist, wrote all the songs as he<br />\nhad on previous albums, but because of disagreements, he<br />\ndid not play or sing on most of the album. He completely<br />\nleft the band after the album's release to pursue different<br />\nmusical directions. The band toured without him, and<br />\nfrom this tour they derived the live album. The chief<br />\nmotive for releasing a live album was not to capture a<br />\nmonumental tour (which it was not) on vinyl, but with<br />\nthe loss of their creative leader, Crack the Sky would have<br />\ngreat troubles recording a studio album with new material<br />\nthat would be an adequate follow-up to the last album.<br />\nThe only way they can sustain their popularity and delay<br />\na decision on the status of the band is through a live<br />\nalbum. The motives behind Live Sky are purely dilatory.<br />\nA Jethro Tull concert is always a tremendous event,<br />\nand as a frontman, Ian Anderson is one of the great rock<br />\nstars of the Seventies, but the motives behind Bursting<br />\nOut hardly seem true to the ideal of the live album. The<br />\nresponse to the madrigal-like compositions on Heavy<br />\nHorses was negative, and even with the success with Songs<br />\nFrom the Wood before - that, fans are crying out for<br />\nmusic like that on Aqualung and Thick as a Brick-- Tull<br />\nfavorites from the early Seventies. But the musical style<br />\nof Jethro Tull has evolved, and the evolution for the most<br />\npart is irreversible. And since Tull had already released<br />\nseveral greatest hit albums (another disturbing<br />\nphenomenon), the only way to keep their die-hard fans<br />\nwith them despite the changing style is to play<br />\n\"Aqualung\" again on a live album, and sustain the hope<br />\nthat they may play it again on a studio album. As long as<br />\nthey hear \"Aqualung,\" even if the studio albums don't<br />\nproduce equivalents, followers will continue to listen.<br />\nBursting Out does a good job of capturing the live Tull<br />\nexperience, but it also proves they aren't too old to rock<br />\nand roll, it gives fans new versions of old favorites and<br />\nmost importantly, it helps Tull retain their popularity<br />\ndespite the unpopularity of their recent studio albums.<br />\nThe Blue Oyster Cult live album, Some Enchanted<br />\nEvening, is a live album for the sake of putting out a live<br />\nalbum. The recording is just shoddy performance of their<br />\nshoddy studio material, the difference being that the<br />\nsound which is loud, unclean and hollow on the studio<br />\nalbums is even more so on the live one.<br />\nLive At Last, the Steeleye Span live album, is also<br />\npointless as a release. It is a recording of the band's final<br />\nconcert before they disbanded 'amicably' five days later.<br />\nBut for a band that never performed in America, this<br />\nraised as a Moslem. Madame Rosa relates to Momo her<br />\nexperiences in German concentration camps, making<br />\ntrivial jokes here and there. The audience is told that<br />\nevery breath may be her last; thus, some suspense is<br />\ngenerated. Her amateurish attempts to keep herself from<br />\nbeing removed to the hospital (since she believes that<br /><br />\nMadame Rosa:<br />\nLife<br />\nWithout Love<br />\none's suffering must not be prolonged, at the expense of<br />\nproviding doctors \"tools\" for their medical research) are, at<br />\ntimes, mildly humorous. At all other times, the movie<br />\ndoes not even make a pretense to provide subtle humor.<br />\nAnother \"disguisting feature\" of the movie is the<br />\nover-abundance of whores. The grossness of their person<br />\nand performance is repelling. Not only do these whores,<br />\nbut Madame Rosa, too, show that fine cinematographers,<br />\nsuch as Nestor Armendros need equally fine directors to<br />\ndisplay their talent.<br /><br />\nconcert, no matter how memorable it is for the band, is of<br />\nno importance to American listeners. Unlike The Last<br />\nWaltz by The Band, the group that has been on the<br />\nAmerican musical scene for 16 years, the preservation of<br />\nSteeleye Span's final concert is worthless.<br />\nThe motives behind David Bowie's live album Stage<br />\nseem most ideal, but even his motives are questionable.<br />\nThis is the second live Bowie recording. The first was a<br />\ngreatest hits-type album, admirably capturing Bowie<br />\nfavorites in concert. The same is true of the new live<br />\nalbum, except that the material is taken strictly from his<br />\nfour studio albums since David Live. But why did Bowie<br /><br />\nDavid Bowie from Stage<br />\nput out another live album with material from only four<br />\nalbums whose popularity was much less than his earlier<br />\nalbums? The music on the newer studio albums<br />\neliminated stories and characters, and became more<br />\nexperimental and mechanical. The Bowie concert also<br />\nchanged. He emerged from behind the masks of his<br />\ncharacters and performed straightforwardly on a stage<br />\nwith a backdrop of vertical white lights. This kind of<br />\nstaging emphasized the starkness of his studio albums, the<br />\nsame way the.staging for his other live album emphasized<br />\nthe characters and stories. Although every Bowie album is<br />\na new musical experience, perhaps Stage signals the end of<br />\nan era of generalized musical form, just like'David Live<br />\nsignalled the end of an era of the Spiders from Mars. The<br />\n'motives behind the new live recording are to capture the<br />\nessence of this Bowie era in concert, and on the next<br />\nstudio album, we can look for a totally different sound.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that within the corpus of live albums,<br />\nthere is such diversity among the motives behind the<br />\nrelease of concert recordings. And it is a shame that the<br />\nmotives are so rarely ideal or artistic. These five live<br />\nalbums are good, but their purpose is ulterior, and they<br />\nfail drastically to capture the pure energy and excitement<br />\nof a live performance on record. Nothing can replace being<br />\nthere.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n4<br />\nEvery critical and concerned viewer must, after<br />\nwatching Madame Rosa, ask himself what purpose art<br />\nshould serve. Should it merely entertain and pacify the<br />\nmind, or should it be a commentary on the nature of<br />\nhuman beings? Madame Rosa, an emotional tale of<br />\nsurrogate motherhood, does pose several questions of<br />\ngrave importance, despite its faults. Must an ill person,<br />\nwhose death is imminent, have his suffering prolonged<br />\nagainst his own will? Although Dr. Katz (Claude<br />\nDauphin), Madam Rosa's personal physician, claims it is<br />\ninhuman to kill a person (regardless of how sick he may<br />\nbe), the question is left unanswered, partly due to the<br />\nnature of the question, and partly due to the failing of the<br />\ndirector to make himself convincing. As Stephen Pepper<br />\nof Harvard said: \"But if the spectator is not weak, there is<br />\nno reason why the work of art should not explain itself ...<br />\nWhen it is necessary to ask an artist what he was trying to<br />\ndo (as the viewer must ask himself), either the spectator<br />\nor the artist is weak.\"<br />\nThe movie ends on a somber note. Madame Rosa<br />\neventually dies, to the relief of the spectator. Momo, in<br />\nfilial devotion, sleeps in the same room with the decaying<br />\nbody for three weeks. This implies that, as human beings,<br />\nwe must love each other, perhaps \"even to a nauseating<br />\nlevel,\" irrespective of our beliefs, religion, or race. An<br />\nadmirable 'me, yes, but , it's carried too far.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nPAGE 18 OCTOBER 27,', 1978<br /><br />\n'A Doll's House' at Theatre Hopkins<br />\ncont. from p. 16<br />\nwoman who has allowed herself to be manipulated by<br />\nmen all her life; first by her father, then by her husband.<br />\nThe husband, Torvald, considers his wife to be nothing<br />\nmore than a plaything, a child who has no intellect who is<br />\nthere for his pleasure and amusement.

The costumes in this production are perfect, the<br />\nlighting accurate, and \u2022 the props, with the exception<br />\nperhaps of the Christmas tree, work well. Cherie Weinert<br />\n(Nora) is outstanding, making the other characters pale by<br />\ncomparison. She is Torvald's perfect \"little lark.\" her<br /><br />\ndancing of the Tarantella is wild and passionate as a<br />\nyoung girl's, yet she makes the transition into a self-aware<br />\ngrown woman as naturally as it is possible, given the<br />\nstory. Michael Gilbert, (Torvald), is a little too stiff,<br />\nseeming to be uncomfortable with his lines (although it's<br />\nnot hard to imagine why). He sounds overly patronizing,<br />\neven for Torvald. Toward the middle of the performance<br />\nhe began to relax and his acting improved immensely.<br />\nMilton Freedman (Dr. Rank) and Wendy Wilson (Kristine<br />\nLinde) are both excellent in their roles as Nora's friends<br />\nand confidants. Peter Gzowski (Nils Krogstad) is an<br />\nabsolu tely despicable corrupted moneylend.er who<br />\nthreatens Nora's protected existence, and Allison Kellner<br />\n(Nora's daughter EMmy) is amazing, her expressions and<br />\ngestures incredibly similar to Ms. Weinart's.<br />\nA Doll's House will be playing in the Barn Theater<br />\nFriday and Saturday nights at 8:30, and Sunday<br />\nafternoons at 2:15 through November 12. Hurry and<br />\nreserve your tickets--it is a play that everyone must see. \u2022<br /><br />\nAt Tlie Bijou<br />\nOn October 27, 28, and 29, the Baltimore Film Forum<br />\nand the Baltimore Museum of Art will show eight French<br />\nfilms, never shown commercially in this country. The<br />\nfilms. made available to us by the French Embassy, will<br />\nhave an admission charge of $1.00 for Film Forum and<br />\nMuseum members, $1.50 for the general public. Films will<br />\nbe screened at the Baltimore Museum of A i's<br />\nauditorium and there will be NO ADVANCE SALES.<br />\nTickets may be purchased at the door for that day's films<br />\none half hour before screening. The schedule of films is as<br />\nfollows:<br /><br />\nRocky Horror Show... Stoned Scare (p. 16)<br />\n'grade-C' pornography, however this is far from true. The<br />\nproduction has many talented performers: the star Tim<br />\nCurry (Frank Furter) is a Shakespearian actor; Susan<br />\nSaradon (Janet) has starred in many films such as The<br />\nOther Side of Midnight and Pretty Baby; Barry Bostock<br />\n(Brad) is an acting member of the New York Metropolitan<br />\nOpera; and this film gave Meatloaf (Eddie) his start,<br />\nhelping to make him what he is today.<br />\nAnother reason is that the movie gives the viewers a<br />\nchance to escape from social pressures, whether they are<br />\ndue to excess school work or socially ridiculed sexual<br />\npreferences among other things. `Rocky' gives them a<br />\nchance to escape into an unreal fantasy world. As one of<br />\nthe last songs in the score says, 'Rose tints my world,<br />\nkeeps me safe from my trouble and pain. It's beyond me.<br />\nHelp me morning ...<br />\nThe most essential reason for the film's success is that it<br />\ngives alienated members of society a pseudo-religious cult.<br />\nThere is a sense of importance' and belonging in the<br />\nritualism of the film. Many of the cultists have been<br />\nthrust into unstable social positions, and cult membership<br />\nhelps to alleviate this feeling of displacement. Indeed,<br />\nthere are some religious parallels in the film. At the<br /><br />\nbeginning of the film. 'hard-core' cultists scream out,<br />\n'And the Lord said: Let there be Lips!' In the movie<br />\ni-tself, there are 'guiding lights from darkness' and 'the fall<br />\nfrom Grace'. In fact,'hard-core' cultists have been known<br />\nto call the Waverly Theater 'Church'.<br />\nOf course, one should not overemphasize this aspect of<br />\nthe movie. There are a large number of 'hard-core'<br />\ncultists, but there are an equally large number of people<br />\nwho go just to escape and relax in the crazy atmosphere,<br />\nor use it as another of the many excuses to smoke or to<br />\npop. The best part about this movie is watching the<br />\npeople in line and in the audience. In New York, the lines<br />\nwould be two blocks long, even in the dead of winter. But<br />\nthe cultists would still be out in force, some dressed only<br />\nin girdles, black stockings and garter belts. A showing can<br />\nundoubtedly be described as a major social event, one<br />\nthat is well-worth attending.<br />\nAt any rate, it is advised that everyone should<br />\nexperience The Rocky Horror Picture Show . It is far<br />\nabove other cult films such as Pink Flamingos and Andy<br />\nWarhol's Bad. Don't be put off by the word 'cult'. It is<br />\nnot just a 'cult' film, but a cultural phenomenon of the<br />\nSeventies.<br /><br />\n10/27<br />\n7:30 p.m.<br />\n10/27<br />\n9:30 p.m.<br />\n10/28<br />\n11:30 a.m.<br /><br />\n10/28<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br /><br />\n10/28<br />\n7:30 p.m.<br />\n10/28<br />\n9:30 p.m.<br /><br />\n10/29<br />\n7:30 p.m.<br /><br />\n10/29<br />\n9:30 p.m.<br /><br />\nLa Horse, Pierre Granier-Deferre.
