Game to<br />\nTake Place Again on<br />\nThanksgiving.<br />\n<br />\nThe Baltimore Athletic Association captured the team trophy in the<br />\ngames held by the South Atlantic<br />\nDivision, Amateur Athletic Union,<br />\non Homewood Field last Friday,<br />\nHopkins taking second among the<br />\nten organizations represented. The<br />\nBaltimore Athletic Association had<br />\na very large number of competitors<br />\nentered under their colors, and with<br />\nhe stellar work of their \"giant\"<br />\nTommy McDonagh, supported by<br />\na large number of lesser satelites,<br />\nthey piled up 47 points while Hopkins was making 34. In the longer<br />\nruns Hopkins had a decided advantage, but their opponents'<br />\nstrength in the hurdles and weights<br />\ngave them the lead.<br />\nMcDonagh was easily the star<br />\nof the meet with 19 points to his<br />\ncredit, made in five events, but Connolly of Hopkins also earned his<br />\nshare of glory, taking part in six<br />\nevents, hurrying back and forth accross the field so as not to miss<br />\nhis turn at anything, and securing<br />\nplaces in five contests with a total<br />\nof ii. It was \"Husky's\" last appearance for Hopkins, ending a<br />\ncareer of four years' faithful work<br />\nand consistent point-winning.<br />\nTwo records of the Association<br />\nwere smashed and one equalled in<br />\nthe afternoon's performance, not<br />\nto speak of a new Hopkins mark<br />\nbeing set in the half-mile run. In<br />\nthe last-named event, Hall went<br />\nout at a pretty good clip from the<br />\nstart, his tracks being closely followed by Chipman of Maryland<br />\nAgricultural College, who kept the<br />\nHopkins man up to his pace. The<br />\ntime, 2 minutes I 2-5 seconds, is<br />\nfour-fifths of second better than the<br />\nold mark, set by E. S. Woodruff,<br />\na graduate student, in 19oo.<br />\nTommy McDonagh was responsible :for disturbing two low<br />\nmarks. In the high hurdles he<br />\ncl:pped a fifth off, by covering the<br />\nground in 15 3-5 seconds, and in<br />\nthe low hurdles he equalled a<br />\nformer performance by tearing<br />\nthrough in 25 4-5. A third association mark was upset by Weidman, Georgetown's sensational<br />\npole-vaulter. After raising the<br />\nstandards by th use of some hurdles, and putting the bar on the<br />\nvery top .of the posts, he cleared<br />\n12 feet with a terrific leap.<br />\nAfter the meet, which is the last<br />\non the schedule for the season, the<br />\nteam elected Harry Straus, '17,<br />\ncaptain of next year's team. Straus<br />\nhas been a hard worker for three<br />\nyears at Hopkins, and prior to that<br />\n<br />\nWith both pitchers in rare form<br />\nand pitching' air-tight ball, St.<br />\nJohn's was just barely able to nose<br />\nout Hopkins 2 10 I, at Homewood,<br />\non Saturday afternoon. The game<br />\nwas exceptionally fast, Captain Ewing's work around third base and<br />\non the paths being the feature of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nIn the first inning Hopkins<br />\nscored. Ewing's speed was responsible for the only tally made by<br />\nthe Black and Blue during the<br />\ngame. He drew a base on balls,<br />\nand then stole second. Tucker's<br />\nerror of Hobbs' easy grounder gave<br />\nEwing a chance to go to third.<br />\nThen the Hopkins captain and<br />\nHobbs pulled a double steal, Ewing being safe at home and Hobbs<br />\nresting securely on second.<br />\nSt. John's won the game in the<br />\nsecond inning. Freeny and Polk<br />\neach drew a base on balls. Then<br />\nSiebold threw the ball over the<br />\nsecond baseman's head in his attempt to prevent the men from<br />\nmaking a double steal. Freeny<br />\ntook home on the play. Elzey then<br />\ncame across with a long two-bagger<br />\nand Polk ran home with the winning run.<br />\nThe rest of the game was hardfought, but resulted in no scoring.<br />\nEwing stopped a St. John's rally<br />\nin the eighth by making a beautiful catch of Burgess' liner and<br />\ndoubling up Elzey at first. Again<br />\nin the ninth, Ewing brought the<br />\nspectators to their feet by running<br />\nover to the fence and catching Jarman's foul.<br />\nIn the ninth inning Hopkins had<br />\na chance to even up the score.<br />\nHowell took first on Freeny's error<br />\nand then stole second. The Hopkins rooters had their hopes raised<br />\nfor a few moments, but Siebold<br />\nfanned at three of Tucker's curves,<br />\nmaking the third out.<br />\nIf Hopkins had won this game<br />\nit would have given them a good<br />\nclaim on the state championship,<br />\nbut as it is, St. John's has won this<br />\nhonor from Hopkins for the first<br />\ntime in years.<br />\nThe score:<br />\nST.

The first proofs<br />\nfor the book are already in the<br />\nhands of Editor-in-chief Tingley,<br />\nand the business arrangements for<br />\nthe payment and distribution of the<br />\nissue are rapidly nearing completion.<br />\nIn its final form, the Hullabaloo<br />\nwill have nearly 300 pages. The<br />\ndummy for the entire issue has<br />\nlong ago been made and presented<br />\nto the printer, and the reading of<br />\nproof was the last stage in the editorial work. This reading came to<br />\nend on last Friday morning, and<br />\nthe time before the book is issued<br />\nwill now be measured entirely by<br />\nthe period required for the mechanical processes of making corrections,<br />\nrunning the forms off the press,<br />\nand binding the separate sheets.<br />\nJudging by the proofs, this year's<br />\nHullabaloo will be one of the best<br />\never produced by a Hopkins class.<br />\nIt is highly original, both in arrangement and in material; the<br />\nart work is of an exceptionally high<br />\ncaliber; and, even in the imperfect<br />\nappearance presented by unbound<br />\nsheets, the contents of the book<br />\npromise to be unusually interesting,<br />\nnot only to the members of the<br />\nSenior Class, but to the University<br />\nas a whole.<br />\nThe business staff is now busily<br />\nengaged in collecting the debts still<br />\noutstanding, and in taking every<br />\npossible means to guarantee a large<br />\ncirculation. Every member of the<br />\ngraduating class has already subscribed for at least one copy, many<br />\nof them for more, and a large number of underclassmen have signified their intention of buying the<br />\nbook. It is in the support of the<br />\nlatter element that the Hullabaloo<br />\nis now particularly interested. The<br />\nedition is to be strictly limited to<br />\nthose who order copies in advance,<br />\nand, as such orders cannot be<br />\nplaced once the book is on the<br />\npress, the business managment will<br />\nbe forced to conclude its campaign<br />\nvery shortly. For this purpose, the<br />\nHullabaloo staff is emphasizing<br />\nmore and more the interest which<br />\nall students of the University should<br />\nhave in the book, both because of<br />\nits contents, and as a matter of increasing its circulation for the time<br />\nwhen they themselves will be the<br />\npublishers.

After a short drill, remarkable for its precise execution,<br />\nDean Brush and Dr. Abercrombie<br />\naddressed the company, both praising it for its spirit in keeping up the<br />\ntraining in the face of so many<br />\ndisadvantages.<br />\nFor several weeks the men had<br />\nbeen practicing diligently on the<br />\ncompany movements and consequently the drill last Monday was<br />\nexecuted with scarcely a flaw. Linton, graduate; Minslow-Baxley,<br />\n'17; Thompson, 'iv; Chesley,'17,<br />\nand Darley, '17, had charge of the<br />\ncompany, one after the other, all<br />\ndisplaying unusual ability in commanding.

Moreover, the<br />\nequipment had not been supplied.<br />\nHe could do more for us, said<br />\nCaptain Kirk, as soon as the new<br />\nbill dealing with military training<br />\nat colleges has been passed.<br />\nDean Brush went on to say that<br />\nprovision will be made to prevent<br />\nthe hours for drill from conflicting<br />\nwith training for the various college teams. The schedule has not<br />\nas yet been arranged, but the time<br />\nfor the drills will be selected in<br />\nsuch a way that the candidates for<br />\nthe teams can also have a chance<br />\nto practice.<br />\nDr. Abercrombie then spoke to<br />\nthe men and, like the Dean, thanked<br />\n<br />\nThe freshmen and sophomores<br />\nwill clash on both lacrosse field and<br />\nbaseball diamond the early part of<br />\nthis week. The ball game will take<br />\nplace Tuesday, while, the rival<br />\ntwelves will meet Wednesday afternoon.

The significance of<br />\nthe undertaking is two-fold: it announces the introduction here of<br />\nyet another phase of student activity apart from the regular academic pursuits, and it places Johns<br />\nHopkins among the other leading<br />\nAmerican universities whose student-bodies are manifesting an<br />\nearnest and investigating attitude<br />\ntowards world-politics.<br />\nWithin the past two years there<br />\nhas developed in the student-bodies<br />\nof America a movement for the<br />\nstudy of international relations and<br />\nfor the promotion of international<br />\npolity that is widespread in its extent and impressive by reason of<br />\nits influence. The propaganda<br />\nforces of the nation, organized outside of the educational institutions,<br />\nare continually turning ta these as<br />\nthe most fruitful field for the development of particular ideas. None<br />\nhave met with such response as<br />\nhave those which attempt to instruct in the fundamental principles upon. which rest the relations<br />\nof one nation with another and<br />\nwhich seek to promote a rational<br />\nconception of national rights. The<br />\nessential sanity of such a program,<br />\ndivested as it is of any particular<br />\nvagary, has won widespread recognition.<br />\nThe organizations in the universities have in most \u2022 cases taken the<br />\nform of International Polity Clubs,<br />\nestablished and fostered Under the<br />\nguidance of the American Asscciation for International Conciliation. This Association, which<br />\nis maintained under the Carnegie Endowment for International<br />\nPeace, is perhaps the most authoritative organization in the world<br />\ntoday that endeavors to give a<br />\npopular interpretation to problems<br />\nof international import and which<br />\nemphasizes this ultimate possibility<br />\nof conciliation between nations<br />\nwhere their peoples have been .educated to an understanding of their<br />\nrespective rights and duties. During<br />\nthe year 1915, the Association provided for the Polity Clubs a series<br />\nof six lectures conducted by international experts on the following topics: History of the Peace<br />\nMovement, the Psychology of War<br />\nand Peace, Economic Factors in<br />\nModern Internationalism, Some<br />\nBiological and Racial Aspects of<br />\n<br />\nWar, the Place of Force in Modern<br />\nCivilization, the Future Outcome<br />\nand World Organization.<br />\nIt is unnecessary to emphasize<br />\nthe trenchant interest of such<br />\ntopics as these. They impress their<br />\nsignificance on the most casual observer of current problems and to<br />\nthe mind dissatisfied with the<br />\nsuperficial conclusions of the day,<br />\nthey are suggestive of intricate<br />\nand underlying .causes. In the<br />\nstudy and discussion of such topics<br />\nthere unquestionably will be found<br />\na more satisfactory state of mind<br />\nthan that produced by the protagonists of the \"peace\" or \"preparedness\" issues as they harangue<br />\ntheir ideas before the nation today.<br />\nThe present, almost inpulsive,<br />\nmove towards internationalism is<br />\nunmistakable evidence of a new era.<br />\nAt Washington this week convents<br />\nthe League to Enforce Peace, presided over by President Lowell of<br />\nHarvard and sponsored by exPresident Taft, and the program<br />\nof which, if ever adopted, would<br />\ncommit America to a course unprecedented and venturesome as<br />\ncompared to its traditional policy.<br />\nWhether the nation shall maintain<br />\nitself in a strong defensive isolation or merge its interests into a<br />\nprotective international alliance is<br />\nan issue that compels attention and<br />\ndemands a decision in the not far<br />\ndistant future. To study such<br />\nproblems as this one, is manifestly<br />\nstimulating and beneficial to any<br />\nstudent group.<br />\nThe International Polity Club at<br />\nHopkins will follow the policy<br />\nusually pursued by such organizations of its kind. It will enlist in<br />\nthe organization such men as evince<br />\nan earnest and sympathetic interest<br />\nin the study of international relationships. At intervals during the<br />\nnext academic year the club will<br />\nattempt to bring to the University<br />\na number of speakers who are especially qualified to discuss international problems. At a time -when<br />\nthe foreign policy of the nation is<br />\nthe .most engrossing public issue,<br />\nthis club will doubtless receive a<br />\nvigorous and enthusiastic support.<br />\nOne of the oldest schools for girls<br />\non the American continent is the<br />\nColegio de la Paz in Mexico City.<br />\nThis was founded by wealthy Spaniards in 1732 for the benefit of the<br />\nchildren of the poorer classes.

It has been announced<br />\nthat the engineering department<br />\nis ready to proceed with the construction on the plans drawn up by<br />\nProfessor Thomas of the Civil Engineering division and Captain<br />\nWagner, chief engineer of the<br />\nBartlett Hayward Company, and<br />\nthat the plant may be in operation<br />\nby next September.<br />\nThe object of the plant is to attack those problems of the gas industry which involve the recovery<br />\nof by-products necessary for use in<br />\nthe manufacture of dye-stuffs,<br />\nmedicinals and explosives. The<br />\nsolving of these problems would<br />\nmake this country independent of<br />\nthe supply from foreign countries<br />\nwhich has been cut off because of<br />\nthe war.<br />\nDuring the past year, a course<br />\non this subject has been given by<br />\nCaptain Wagner to a class of 17<br />\ngraduate students, and has been<br />\naccompanied by comprehensive<br />\nlaboratory work. Great interest<br />\nhas been displayed in the course not<br />\nonly in the University itself among<br />\nthe local scientific students, but<br />\nalso by colleges throughout the<br />\ncountry. Many of these institutions have written to the head of<br />\nthe Hopkins department asking<br />\nwhether the course is to be continued in coming years.<br />\n<br />\nThere will be several new courses<br />\noffered at this year's summer<br />\nschool. One of the most interesting of these is \"The Money Market and the European War,\" to be<br />\ngiven by Dr. Whitney. The course<br />\nis especially designed for those who<br />\nhave had some previous knowledge<br />\nof political economy or who are<br />\nfamiliar with the fundaments of<br />\nbanking and finance. It can be<br />\ntaken for graduate credit. A discussion of monetary laws, an analysis of the banking systems in the<br />\nchief money markets of the world<br />\nand a study\u2022of the principles of foreign exchange will be among the<br />\nimportant points taken up. Special<br />\nemphasis will be laid on the effects<br />\nof the war on international exchanges as the result of the accumulations of gold, the selling of<br />\nsecurities and the issuing of paper<br />\nmoney.<br />\nAnother of Dr. Whitney's courses<br />\nwill be \"Public Finance.'\" In this<br />\nthe methods of collecting public revenue and taxes and of expenditures will be critically analyzed.<br />\nProfessor Wood, of the Department of German, will lecture on the<br />\nsubject of \"Swabian and Austrian<br />\nPoets in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century.\" The period will<br />\nrange from the life of Uhland up<br />\nto that of Morike.

Game to<br />\nTake Place Again on<br />\nThanksgiving.<br /><br />\nThe Baltimore Athletic Association captured the team trophy in the<br />\ngames held by the South Atlantic<br />\nDivision, Amateur Athletic Union,<br />\non Homewood Field last Friday,<br />\nHopkins taking second among the<br />\nten organizations represented. The<br />\nBaltimore Athletic Association had<br />\na very large number of competitors<br />\nentered under their colors, and with<br />\nhe stellar work of their \"giant\"<br />\nTommy McDonagh, supported by<br />\na large number of lesser satelites,<br />\nthey piled up 47 points while Hopkins was making 34. In the longer<br />\nruns Hopkins had a decided advantage, but their opponents'<br />\nstrength in the hurdles and weights<br />\ngave them the lead.<br />\nMcDonagh was easily the star<br />\nof the meet with 19 points to his<br />\ncredit, made in five events, but Connolly of Hopkins also earned his<br />\nshare of glory, taking part in six<br />\nevents, hurrying back and forth accross the field so as not to miss<br />\nhis turn at anything, and securing<br />\nplaces in five contests with a total<br />\nof ii. It was \"Husky's\" last appearance for Hopkins, ending a<br />\ncareer of four years' faithful work<br />\nand consistent point-winning.<br />\nTwo records of the Association<br />\nwere smashed and one equalled in<br />\nthe afternoon's performance, not<br />\nto speak of a new Hopkins mark<br />\nbeing set in the half-mile run. In<br />\nthe last-named event, Hall went<br />\nout at a pretty good clip from the<br />\nstart, his tracks being closely followed by Chipman of Maryland<br />\nAgricultural College, who kept the<br />\nHopkins man up to his pace. The<br />\ntime, 2 minutes I 2-5 seconds, is<br />\nfour-fifths of second better than the<br />\nold mark, set by E. S. Woodruff,<br />\na graduate student, in 19oo.<br />\nTommy McDonagh was responsible :for disturbing two low<br />\nmarks. In the high hurdles he<br />\ncl:pped a fifth off, by covering the<br />\nground in 15 3-5 seconds, and in<br />\nthe low hurdles he equalled a<br />\nformer performance by tearing<br />\nthrough in 25 4-5. A third association mark was upset by Weidman, Georgetown's sensational<br />\npole-vaulter. After raising the<br />\nstandards by th use of some hurdles, and putting the bar on the<br />\nvery top .of the posts, he cleared<br />\n12 feet with a terrific leap.<br />\nAfter the meet, which is the last<br />\non the schedule for the season, the<br />\nteam elected Harry Straus, '17,<br />\ncaptain of next year's team. Straus<br />\nhas been a hard worker for three<br />\nyears at Hopkins, and prior to that<br /><br />\nWith both pitchers in rare form<br />\nand pitching' air-tight ball, St.<br />\nJohn's was just barely able to nose<br />\nout Hopkins 2 10 I, at Homewood,<br />\non Saturday afternoon. The game<br />\nwas exceptionally fast, Captain Ewing's work around third base and<br />\non the paths being the feature of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nIn the first inning Hopkins<br />\nscored. Ewing's speed was responsible for the only tally made by<br />\nthe Black and Blue during the<br />\ngame. He drew a base on balls,<br />\nand then stole second. Tucker's<br />\nerror of Hobbs' easy grounder gave<br />\nEwing a chance to go to third.<br />\nThen the Hopkins captain and<br />\nHobbs pulled a double steal, Ewing being safe at home and Hobbs<br />\nresting securely on second.<br />\nSt. John's won the game in the<br />\nsecond inning. Freeny and Polk<br />\neach drew a base on balls. Then<br />\nSiebold threw the ball over the<br />\nsecond baseman's head in his attempt to prevent the men from<br />\nmaking a double steal. Freeny<br />\ntook home on the play. Elzey then<br />\ncame across with a long two-bagger<br />\nand Polk ran home with the winning run.<br />\nThe rest of the game was hardfought, but resulted in no scoring.<br />\nEwing stopped a St. John's rally<br />\nin the eighth by making a beautiful catch of Burgess' liner and<br />\ndoubling up Elzey at first. Again<br />\nin the ninth, Ewing brought the<br />\nspectators to their feet by running<br />\nover to the fence and catching Jarman's foul.<br />\nIn the ninth inning Hopkins had<br />\na chance to even up the score.<br />\nHowell took first on Freeny's error<br />\nand then stole second. The Hopkins rooters had their hopes raised<br />\nfor a few moments, but Siebold<br />\nfanned at three of Tucker's curves,<br />\nmaking the third out.<br />\nIf Hopkins had won this game<br />\nit would have given them a good<br />\nclaim on the state championship,<br />\nbut as it is, St. John's has won this<br />\nhonor from Hopkins for the first<br />\ntime in years.<br />\nThe score:<br />\nST.

The first proofs<br />\nfor the book are already in the<br />\nhands of Editor-in-chief Tingley,<br />\nand the business arrangements for<br />\nthe payment and distribution of the<br />\nissue are rapidly nearing completion.<br />\nIn its final form, the Hullabaloo<br />\nwill have nearly 300 pages. The<br />\ndummy for the entire issue has<br />\nlong ago been made and presented<br />\nto the printer, and the reading of<br />\nproof was the last stage in the editorial work. This reading came to<br />\nend on last Friday morning, and<br />\nthe time before the book is issued<br />\nwill now be measured entirely by<br />\nthe period required for the mechanical processes of making corrections,<br />\nrunning the forms off the press,<br />\nand binding the separate sheets.<br />\nJudging by the proofs, this year's<br />\nHullabaloo will be one of the best<br />\never produced by a Hopkins class.<br />\nIt is highly original, both in arrangement and in material; the<br />\nart work is of an exceptionally high<br />\ncaliber; and, even in the imperfect<br />\nappearance presented by unbound<br />\nsheets, the contents of the book<br />\npromise to be unusually interesting,<br />\nnot only to the members of the<br />\nSenior Class, but to the University<br />\nas a whole.<br />\nThe business staff is now busily<br />\nengaged in collecting the debts still<br />\noutstanding, and in taking every<br />\npossible means to guarantee a large<br />\ncirculation. Every member of the<br />\ngraduating class has already subscribed for at least one copy, many<br />\nof them for more, and a large number of underclassmen have signified their intention of buying the<br />\nbook. It is in the support of the<br />\nlatter element that the Hullabaloo<br />\nis now particularly interested. The<br />\nedition is to be strictly limited to<br />\nthose who order copies in advance,<br />\nand, as such orders cannot be<br />\nplaced once the book is on the<br />\npress, the business managment will<br />\nbe forced to conclude its campaign<br />\nvery shortly. For this purpose, the<br />\nHullabaloo staff is emphasizing<br />\nmore and more the interest which<br />\nall students of the University should<br />\nhave in the book, both because of<br />\nits contents, and as a matter of increasing its circulation for the time<br />\nwhen they themselves will be the<br />\npublishers.

After a short drill, remarkable for its precise execution,<br />\nDean Brush and Dr. Abercrombie<br />\naddressed the company, both praising it for its spirit in keeping up the<br />\ntraining in the face of so many<br />\ndisadvantages.<br />\nFor several weeks the men had<br />\nbeen practicing diligently on the<br />\ncompany movements and consequently the drill last Monday was<br />\nexecuted with scarcely a flaw. Linton, graduate; Minslow-Baxley,<br />\n'17; Thompson, 'iv; Chesley,'17,<br />\nand Darley, '17, had charge of the<br />\ncompany, one after the other, all<br />\ndisplaying unusual ability in commanding. After the company was<br />\nput through first the simple and<br />\nthen the more involved movements,<br />\nthe command \"pass in review\" was<br />\ngiven. Immediately squads right<br />\nwas executed and the company in<br />\ntwo straight lines passed by the reviewers with \"eyes right,\" the<br />\nsalute in marching.<br />\nAfter. three quarters of an hour<br />\nof drill the company was halted<br />\nbefore the reviewing stand, the<br />\nsteps in front of Gilman Hall.<br />\nWhile the men stood at rest, the<br />\nDean thanked them for the praiseworthy support that they had given<br />\nthe company. 'Never,\" he said,<br />\n\"have Hopkins men .displayed<br />\ngreater loyalty to their Alma Mater<br />\nthan you have, and you are to be<br />\ncommended for it. We who have<br />\nwatched you have been greatly impressed by the spirit you have displayed and by the importance of<br />\nthe movement and we shall do<br />\neverything in our power to make<br />\nit a success next year.\"<br />\nDean Brush went on to say that<br />\nhe had been informed by Captain<br />\nKirk, the officer of the War Department who inspected, the company at one of its first drills, that<br />\nthe reason no officer had been sent<br />\nto Hopkins was because of the<br />\nMexican situation. Moreover, the<br />\nequipment had not been supplied.<br />\nHe could do more for us, said<br />\nCaptain Kirk, as soon as the new<br />\nbill dealing with military training<br />\nat colleges has been passed.<br />\nDean Brush went on to say that<br />\nprovision will be made to prevent<br />\nthe hours for drill from conflicting<br />\nwith training for the various college teams. The schedule has not<br />\nas yet been arranged, but the time<br />\nfor the drills will be selected in<br />\nsuch a way that the candidates for<br />\nthe teams can also have a chance<br />\nto practice.<br />\nDr. Abercrombie then spoke to<br />\nthe men and, like the Dean, thanked<br /><br />\nThe freshmen and sophomores<br />\nwill clash on both lacrosse field and<br />\nbaseball diamond the early part of<br />\nthis week. The ball game will take<br />\nplace Tuesday, while, the rival<br />\ntwelves will meet Wednesday afternoon. Both classes have been<br />\npracticing faithfully and two hard<br />\nfought and well played games<br />\nshould take place. The sophomores<br />\nseem to have an edge on the freshmen in lacrosse, but the first-year<br />\nmen are counting on Wasserman,<br />\nthe star twirler of last year's City<br />\nCollege nine, to trim the sophies<br />\non the diamond.<br />\nOn the sophomore lacrosse team<br />\nare F.

The significance of<br />\nthe undertaking is two-fold: it announces the introduction here of<br />\nyet another phase of student activity apart from the regular academic pursuits, and it places Johns<br />\nHopkins among the other leading<br />\nAmerican universities whose student-bodies are manifesting an<br />\nearnest and investigating attitude<br />\ntowards world-politics.<br />\nWithin the past two years there<br />\nhas developed in the student-bodies<br />\nof America a movement for the<br />\nstudy of international relations and<br />\nfor the promotion of international<br />\npolity that is widespread in its extent and impressive by reason of<br />\nits influence. The propaganda<br />\nforces of the nation, organized outside of the educational institutions,<br />\nare continually turning ta these as<br />\nthe most fruitful field for the development of particular ideas. None<br />\nhave met with such response as<br />\nhave those which attempt to instruct in the fundamental principles upon. which rest the relations<br />\nof one nation with another and<br />\nwhich seek to promote a rational<br />\nconception of national rights. The<br />\nessential sanity of such a program,<br />\ndivested as it is of any particular<br />\nvagary, has won widespread recognition.<br />\nThe organizations in the universities have in most \u2022 cases taken the<br />\nform of International Polity Clubs,<br />\nestablished and fostered Under the<br />\nguidance of the American Asscciation for International Conciliation. This Association, which<br />\nis maintained under the Carnegie Endowment for International<br />\nPeace, is perhaps the most authoritative organization in the world<br />\ntoday that endeavors to give a<br />\npopular interpretation to problems<br />\nof international import and which<br />\nemphasizes this ultimate possibility<br />\nof conciliation between nations<br />\nwhere their peoples have been .educated to an understanding of their<br />\nrespective rights and duties. During<br />\nthe year 1915, the Association provided for the Polity Clubs a series<br />\nof six lectures conducted by international experts on the following topics: History of the Peace<br />\nMovement, the Psychology of War<br />\nand Peace, Economic Factors in<br />\nModern Internationalism, Some<br />\nBiological and Racial Aspects of<br /><br />\nWar, the Place of Force in Modern<br />\nCivilization, the Future Outcome<br />\nand World Organization.<br />\nIt is unnecessary to emphasize<br />\nthe trenchant interest of such<br />\ntopics as these. They impress their<br />\nsignificance on the most casual observer of current problems and to<br />\nthe mind dissatisfied with the<br />\nsuperficial conclusions of the day,<br />\nthey are suggestive of intricate<br />\nand underlying .causes. In the<br />\nstudy and discussion of such topics<br />\nthere unquestionably will be found<br />\na more satisfactory state of mind<br />\nthan that produced by the protagonists of the \"peace\" or \"preparedness\" issues as they harangue<br />\ntheir ideas before the nation today.<br />\nThe present, almost inpulsive,<br />\nmove towards internationalism is<br />\nunmistakable evidence of a new era.<br />\nAt Washington this week convents<br />\nthe League to Enforce Peace, presided over by President Lowell of<br />\nHarvard and sponsored by exPresident Taft, and the program<br />\nof which, if ever adopted, would<br />\ncommit America to a course unprecedented and venturesome as<br />\ncompared to its traditional policy.<br />\nWhether the nation shall maintain<br />\nitself in a strong defensive isolation or merge its interests into a<br />\nprotective international alliance is<br />\nan issue that compels attention and<br />\ndemands a decision in the not far<br />\ndistant future. To study such<br />\nproblems as this one, is manifestly<br />\nstimulating and beneficial to any<br />\nstudent group.<br />\nThe International Polity Club at<br />\nHopkins will follow the policy<br />\nusually pursued by such organizations of its kind. It will enlist in<br />\nthe organization such men as evince<br />\nan earnest and sympathetic interest<br />\nin the study of international relationships. At intervals during the<br />\nnext academic year the club will<br />\nattempt to bring to the University<br />\na number of speakers who are especially qualified to discuss international problems.

Being hated and neglected by<br />\nhis own mother and by his other<br />\nrelatives, he was left to the care of<br />\npedagogues, women and slaves.<br />\nThe effect of this, Mr. Ruth<br />\npointed out, was that he grew up<br />\na recluse until, after the murder<br />\nof the undoubtedly insane Caligula, he became emperor.

It has been announced<br />\nthat the engineering department<br />\nis ready to proceed with the construction on the plans drawn up by<br />\nProfessor Thomas of the Civil Engineering division and Captain<br />\nWagner, chief engineer of the<br />\nBartlett Hayward Company, and<br />\nthat the plant may be in operation<br />\nby next September.<br />\nThe object of the plant is to attack those problems of the gas industry which involve the recovery<br />\nof by-products necessary for use in<br />\nthe manufacture of dye-stuffs,<br />\nmedicinals and explosives. The<br />\nsolving of these problems would<br />\nmake this country independent of<br />\nthe supply from foreign countries<br />\nwhich has been cut off because of<br />\nthe war.<br />\nDuring the past year, a course<br />\non this subject has been given by<br />\nCaptain Wagner to a class of 17<br />\ngraduate students, and has been<br />\naccompanied by comprehensive<br />\nlaboratory work. Great interest<br />\nhas been displayed in the course not<br />\nonly in the University itself among<br />\nthe local scientific students, but<br />\nalso by colleges throughout the<br />\ncountry. Many of these institutions have written to the head of<br />\nthe Hopkins department asking<br />\nwhether the course is to be continued in coming years.<br /><br />\nThere will be several new courses<br />\noffered at this year's summer<br />\nschool. One of the most interesting of these is \"The Money Market and the European War,\" to be<br />\ngiven by Dr. Whitney. The course<br />\nis especially designed for those who<br />\nhave had some previous knowledge<br />\nof political economy or who are<br />\nfamiliar with the fundaments of<br />\nbanking and finance. It can be<br />\ntaken for graduate credit. A discussion of monetary laws, an analysis of the banking systems in the<br />\nchief money markets of the world<br />\nand a study\u2022of the principles of foreign exchange will be among the<br />\nimportant points taken up. Special<br />\nemphasis will be laid on the effects<br />\nof the war on international exchanges as the result of the accumulations of gold, the selling of<br />\nsecurities and the issuing of paper<br />\nmoney.<br />\nAnother of Dr. Whitney's courses<br />\nwill be \"Public Finance.'\" In this<br />\nthe methods of collecting public revenue and taxes and of expenditures will be critically analyzed.<br />\nProfessor Wood, of the Department of German, will lecture on the<br />\nsubject of \"Swabian and Austrian<br />\nPoets in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century.\" The period will<br />\nrange from the life of Uhland up<br />\nto that of Morike. Professor Gay,<br />\nof Goucher College, will give one<br />\ncourse in the history of English<br />\nLiterature from 160o to 1775, taking up the lives and works of Milton, Dryden, Pope and Johnson,<br />\nand other authors of their age and<br />\nschool.<br />\nAnother course dealing with the<br />\nUNIVERSITY DIRECTORY<br />\nI<br />\nEuropean War is \"International<br />\nLaw,\" by Assistant Professor<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nCrane.
