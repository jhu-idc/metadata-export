Dr. Long defeated his conservative Republican opponent, Fife Symington,<br />\nand became a member-elect of<br />\nthe United States House of Represntatives from one of the<br />\ntwenty most populous congressional districts in the country.<br />\nIn a Wednesday morning assessment of his success, the new<br />\ncongressman noted that his opponent had \"spent a fabulous<br />\nsum of money and even brought<br />\nin Goldwater and Eisenhower<br />\nto help.\" According to Dr. Long,<br />\nthe Second District went \"solidly for Nixon\" in 1960.<br />\nThe Hopkins economist won<br />\nhis seat in the House by a margin of about 7,000 votes. His<br />\nlast effort to win an elective<br />\noffice ended with defeat in the<br />\nprimary election for U.S. Sena-<br />\n<br />\ntor.

PASNER<br />\n<br />\nLimit Of Fed Payments<br />\nLowers School Income<br />\nThis article is the second in a<br />\nseries which deals with the problems arising from federal grants<br />\nand contracts with institutions of<br />\nhigher learning.<br />\nA balance sheet of advantages<br />\nand disadvantages resulting from<br />\nfederal grants and contracts with<br />\nthe University was outlined for<br />\nthe News-Letter as part of this<br />\nseries by Mr. Ridgely Warneld,<br />\nthe Director of the Institute for<br />\nCooperative Research.<br />\nMr. Watheld made a distinction between two forms of federal support of research on the<br />\nPart of the University: contracts<br />\nand grants. Contracts require<br />\nmore rigorous administrative details than do grants which carry<br />\nWith them a relative freedom of<br />\nUse.<br />\nAdvantages<br />\nFederal aid to education offers,<br />\nIn general, three principal advantages to the University, according to Mr. Warfield. First of<br />\nall, it allows the University to<br />\nPay twelve month salaries to<br />\nthose faculty members engaged<br />\nin federal government supported<br />\nresearch. Other faculty members<br />\nare paid on the basis of an academic year.<br />\nSecondly, stipends to graduate<br />\nstudents from federally supported wo-rk allow them to do fundamental research which ties in<br />\nwith their thesis work.<br />\nFinally, such grants and contracts make equipment available<br />\nto the University that it otherwise might not be able to afford.<br />\nCosts<br />\nThe costs of such contracts<br />\nare of two types, direct and indirect. Direct costs consist of<br />\nsalaries, equipments, supplies<br />\nand communication facilities<br />\nbearing a direct relation to the<br />\ncarrying out of specific projects.<br />\nIndirect costs are not readily<br />\nidentifiable with specific projects,<br />\nbut include such things as administrative and general expenses, expenses to the physical<br />\nplant, use of library facilities,<br />\nuse of additional University<br />\nowned equipment, fringe benefits<br />\nto employees involved in the<br />\nprojects, etc.<br />\nTo help defray these costs, the<br />\nfederal government reimburses<br />\nuniversities for indirect costs.<br />\nCurrently there is a law limiting<br />\nindirect costs on Public Health<br />\nService grants to 15% and there<br />\nis also a statutory limit on grants<br />\nmade by the agencies of the<br />\nDepartment of Defense allowing<br />\n<br />\nNavy Awards<br />\nApp. Physics Lab<br />\n$15.5 Million<br />\nThe JHU's Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory has been awarded a<br />\n$15,500,000 contract by the Department of the Navy. This announcement was made by Representative Daniel Brewster (D.,<br />\nMd.).<br />\nThe award, Mr. Brewster said,<br />\nIs an increment on a continuing<br />\nresearch and development contract for work on ordinance and<br />\nrelated equipment for the Bureau<br />\nOf Naval Weapons.<br />\nThe contract work involved is<br />\nbeing done in the Hopkins laboratories in Silver Spring, Maryland, and in Howard county.

It, of course, means that<br />\nthe University must put up the<br />\ndifference generated by substandard indirect expense reimbursements. This forces the University<br />\nto turn to other funds available<br />\nto it, namely its income from<br />\nendowment and tuition. This<br />\ntakes away not only from the<br />\nUniversity's educational progress<br />\nbut also from its own research.<br />\nThe University has made a case<br />\nto the federal government for<br />\nfull reimbursement of expenses,<br />\nfeeling that it should be equitably paid. It hopes that sometime<br />\nin the future the federal government will pay for these added<br />\nexpenses which its own grants<br />\nand contracts incur upon private<br />\n<br />\nOFFICIAL HOPKINS BLAZER<br />\nON DISPLAY AT OUR STUDENT<br />\nSHOP IN LEVERING HALL<br />\n<br />\nWe rent formal attire<br />\n<br />\nNew now in Baltimore!<br />\n<br />\nBOOKS ON ISSUES OF THE DAY<br />\nEXTRACURRICULAR<br />\nENTERTAINMENT<br />\n<br />\nAXERS<br />\nThe Unique New<br />\nNational<br />\nCollege Magazine<br />\nAt Nearby Newsstands<br />\n<br />\nPEACE, LABOR, CONFORMITY<br />\nCIVIL RIGHTS.

In its usual<br />\nofficious fashion the Student Council has directed workhorse Jim MeClaine to conduct an exhaustive survey of<br />\nwhat campus organizations need more money and why.<br />\nA report will then be prepared, presumably by the Committee on Official Reports, and submitted to the Deans.<br />\nThat improvement is necessary in the nature and<br />\nScope of undergraduate diversions has long been a commonplace of life at Hopkins. The current approach to<br />\nthe problem seems, however, to avoid the essence of<br />\nthe trouble. What has been lacking even more than<br />\nmoney is effective and imaginative leadership.<br />\nThe emphasis in student government seems to have<br />\nshifted from its proper course. Far more imagination<br />\nand creative effort is expended in the act of getting<br />\nelected to office that in doing something constructive<br />\nonce this useful end is attained. This is not to belie the<br />\nsincerity of the Hopkins version of the Big Man On<br />\nCampus; real efforts to \"do something\" are being made.<br />\nThe motivation for these efforts appears, however, to<br />\nbe a little misguided. They seem to stem more from<br />\na vague sense of duty than from genuine interest. The<br />\nprevailing attitude boils down to:\"I am a leader. Leaders<br />\nare to lead. Therefore I will lead\u2014somewhere.\"<br />\nThe result of this had faith is that ends get lost<br />\nin means. To \"do something\" simply for the sake of<br />\nactivity becomes a prime motivation. This is a perversion of the whole idea behind extra-curricular activities. We remind the various august personages about<br />\nour brickyard that they are supposed to enjoy what they<br />\nare doing. Unless they do they are wasting their time<br />\nand ours.<br />\nIf our campus lemters have no aims more concrete<br />\nand constructive than \"improvement\" or \"getting something done around here,\" why don't they relax, enjoy<br />\ntheir official prestige and let us alone. Everyone would<br />\nhe much happier and we would he spared such spectacles<br />\nas the Student Council's solemn debate on whether or<br />\nnot to enter an alligator in an intercollegiate alligator<br />\nrace, the proper positioning of the garbage cans on<br />\ncampus and the height of the bumps in the road.<br />\n<br />\nEnter Mickey Mouse<br />\nWe note in passing that an instructor in a popular<br />\nundergraduate History course has announced that exam<br />\ngrades will be lowered for poor handwriting.

E. KENNEDY, In.<br />\nHopkins students do not seem<br />\nto know how to read or to grasp<br />\nconcepts, according to Mort Rosenberg, Instructor of Political<br />\nScience Elements and counsellor<br />\nof Griffin House.<br />\nHe feels, that, the basis of the<br />\nproblem, is a lack of concentration as well as poor note taking<br />\nand lack of preparation before<br />\nclasses. Students have a passive<br />\nattitude toward their assignments. They are not trying to<br />\ngrasp the essential issues to learn<br />\nbasic facts, to coordinate and<br />\nrelate material. They have a<br />\n\"sit back\" and \"feed me\" attitude which explains their inability to verbalize lecture and<br />\n<br />\nreading material accurately.<br />\nMr. Rosenberg, graduate of<br />\nHarvard Law school, who finished a year's practice in New<br />\nYork City before coming to Hopkins, uses a method which he<br />\nfeels is the sure cure for student<br />\npassivity\u2014the Socratic method.<br />\nIf students are apathetic, says<br />\nRosenberg, it is not entirely their<br />\nfault. The lecture method used<br />\nalmost exclusively at Hopkins<br />\nfails to demand from the students. This method is adopted,<br />\nhe says, because it is thought to<br />\nbe more adequate for covering a<br />\nlarge amount of material. If,<br />\nhowever, the Socratic method is<br />\nused properly (the way it is used<br />\nat Harvard Law school), more<br />\nmaterial can be covered more<br />\n<br />\nPlay Review<br />\n<br />\nO'Neill And Shaw And<br />\nAll Wonderful And Fine<br />\nBy LARRY FELDMAN<br />\nYes, and great and good and<br />\nglorious Saturday night and all<br />\nattended and all were pleased<br />\nand all were happy and great<br />\nGod what glorious fun and<br />\nO'Neill and Shaw and lighting<br />\nand scenery and sound and all<br />\nwonderful.

If someone gives a<br />\nwrong answer, the answer is<br />\nwrong not the student.<br />\nStudent Interest<br />\nStudents, feels Rosenberg, are<br />\ninterested if someone can interest<br />\nthem and stimulate their curiosity. A \"thread\" to connect facts<br />\nis one requisite of an interesting<br />\nclass. Facts without a theme are<br />\nmeaningless and a theme without<br />\nfacts is groundless. Only the<br />\nteacher can supply the theme.<br />\nMr. Rosenberg's method is a<br />\nsure check<br />\nagainst student<br />\napathy and intellectual laziness.<br />\nIt is also a sure check on the<br />\ntendency of some students to<br />\nbecome intellectuals before they<br />\nare students; of floating around<br />\non the \"third level of meaning\"<br />\nbefore understanding or even<br />\noccasionally reading the text.<br />\n<br />\nealtliedizoodeitce<br />\nWhat A 'Speel'!<br />\n<br />\ndesiring them and also whether<br />\nor not The Hopkins is especially<br />\nencouraging those prospective<br />\nstudents who would be scared off<br />\nby a possible \"quota\" system or<br />\na possible racist atmosphere and<br />\nenvironment at the Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\ntruth of your position.<br />\nAccording to your view, we use<br />\nI find the editorial policy of<br />\n\"open negotiation and money\"<br />\nthe News-Letter confusing.

Dr. Long defeated his conservative Republican opponent, Fife Symington,<br />\nand became a member-elect of<br />\nthe United States House of Represntatives from one of the<br />\ntwenty most populous congressional districts in the country.<br />\nIn a Wednesday morning assessment of his success, the new<br />\ncongressman noted that his opponent had \"spent a fabulous<br />\nsum of money and even brought<br />\nin Goldwater and Eisenhower<br />\nto help.\" According to Dr. Long,<br />\nthe Second District went \"solidly for Nixon\" in 1960.<br />\nThe Hopkins economist won<br />\nhis seat in the House by a margin of about 7,000 votes. His<br />\nlast effort to win an elective<br />\noffice ended with defeat in the<br />\nprimary election for U.S. Sena-<br /><br />\ntor.

PASNER<br /><br />\nLimit Of Fed Payments<br />\nLowers School Income<br />\nThis article is the second in a<br />\nseries which deals with the problems arising from federal grants<br />\nand contracts with institutions of<br />\nhigher learning.<br />\nA balance sheet of advantages<br />\nand disadvantages resulting from<br />\nfederal grants and contracts with<br />\nthe University was outlined for<br />\nthe News-Letter as part of this<br />\nseries by Mr. Ridgely Warneld,<br />\nthe Director of the Institute for<br />\nCooperative Research.<br />\nMr. Watheld made a distinction between two forms of federal support of research on the<br />\nPart of the University: contracts<br />\nand grants. Contracts require<br />\nmore rigorous administrative details than do grants which carry<br />\nWith them a relative freedom of<br />\nUse.<br />\nAdvantages<br />\nFederal aid to education offers,<br />\nIn general, three principal advantages to the University, according to Mr. Warfield. First of<br />\nall, it allows the University to<br />\nPay twelve month salaries to<br />\nthose faculty members engaged<br />\nin federal government supported<br />\nresearch. Other faculty members<br />\nare paid on the basis of an academic year.<br />\nSecondly, stipends to graduate<br />\nstudents from federally supported wo-rk allow them to do fundamental research which ties in<br />\nwith their thesis work.<br />\nFinally, such grants and contracts make equipment available<br />\nto the University that it otherwise might not be able to afford.<br />\nCosts<br />\nThe costs of such contracts<br />\nare of two types, direct and indirect. Direct costs consist of<br />\nsalaries, equipments, supplies<br />\nand communication facilities<br />\nbearing a direct relation to the<br />\ncarrying out of specific projects.<br />\nIndirect costs are not readily<br />\nidentifiable with specific projects,<br />\nbut include such things as administrative and general expenses, expenses to the physical<br />\nplant, use of library facilities,<br />\nuse of additional University<br />\nowned equipment, fringe benefits<br />\nto employees involved in the<br />\nprojects, etc.<br />\nTo help defray these costs, the<br />\nfederal government reimburses<br />\nuniversities for indirect costs.<br />\nCurrently there is a law limiting<br />\nindirect costs on Public Health<br />\nService grants to 15% and there<br />\nis also a statutory limit on grants<br />\nmade by the agencies of the<br />\nDepartment of Defense allowing<br /><br />\nNavy Awards<br />\nApp. Physics Lab<br />\n$15.5 Million<br />\nThe JHU's Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory has been awarded a<br />\n$15,500,000 contract by the Department of the Navy. This announcement was made by Representative Daniel Brewster (D.,<br />\nMd.).<br />\nThe award, Mr. Brewster said,<br />\nIs an increment on a continuing<br />\nresearch and development contract for work on ordinance and<br />\nrelated equipment for the Bureau<br />\nOf Naval Weapons.<br />\nThe contract work involved is<br />\nbeing done in the Hopkins laboratories in Silver Spring, Maryland, and in Howard county.

It, of course, means that<br />\nthe University must put up the<br />\ndifference generated by substandard indirect expense reimbursements. This forces the University<br />\nto turn to other funds available<br />\nto it, namely its income from<br />\nendowment and tuition. This<br />\ntakes away not only from the<br />\nUniversity's educational progress<br />\nbut also from its own research.<br />\nThe University has made a case<br />\nto the federal government for<br />\nfull reimbursement of expenses,<br />\nfeeling that it should be equitably paid. It hopes that sometime<br />\nin the future the federal government will pay for these added<br />\nexpenses which its own grants<br />\nand contracts incur upon private<br /><br />\nOFFICIAL HOPKINS BLAZER<br />\nON DISPLAY AT OUR STUDENT<br />\nSHOP IN LEVERING HALL<br /><br />\nWe rent formal attire<br /><br />\nNew now in Baltimore!<br /><br />\nBOOKS ON ISSUES OF THE DAY<br />\nEXTRACURRICULAR<br />\nENTERTAINMENT<br /><br />\nAXERS<br />\nThe Unique New<br />\nNational<br />\nCollege Magazine<br />\nAt Nearby Newsstands<br /><br />\nPEACE, LABOR, CONFORMITY<br />\nCIVIL RIGHTS.

Wilson Shaffer<br /><br />\nOf Push And Pull<br />\nA move is underway to obtain more funds from<br />\ndie administration for Student Activities. In its usual<br />\nofficious fashion the Student Council has directed workhorse Jim MeClaine to conduct an exhaustive survey of<br />\nwhat campus organizations need more money and why.<br />\nA report will then be prepared, presumably by the Committee on Official Reports, and submitted to the Deans.<br />\nThat improvement is necessary in the nature and<br />\nScope of undergraduate diversions has long been a commonplace of life at Hopkins. The current approach to<br />\nthe problem seems, however, to avoid the essence of<br />\nthe trouble. What has been lacking even more than<br />\nmoney is effective and imaginative leadership.<br />\nThe emphasis in student government seems to have<br />\nshifted from its proper course. Far more imagination<br />\nand creative effort is expended in the act of getting<br />\nelected to office that in doing something constructive<br />\nonce this useful end is attained. This is not to belie the<br />\nsincerity of the Hopkins version of the Big Man On<br />\nCampus; real efforts to \"do something\" are being made.<br />\nThe motivation for these efforts appears, however, to<br />\nbe a little misguided. They seem to stem more from<br />\na vague sense of duty than from genuine interest. The<br />\nprevailing attitude boils down to:\"I am a leader. Leaders<br />\nare to lead. Therefore I will lead\u2014somewhere.\"<br />\nThe result of this had faith is that ends get lost<br />\nin means. To \"do something\" simply for the sake of<br />\nactivity becomes a prime motivation. This is a perversion of the whole idea behind extra-curricular activities. We remind the various august personages about<br />\nour brickyard that they are supposed to enjoy what they<br />\nare doing. Unless they do they are wasting their time<br />\nand ours.<br />\nIf our campus lemters have no aims more concrete<br />\nand constructive than \"improvement\" or \"getting something done around here,\" why don't they relax, enjoy<br />\ntheir official prestige and let us alone.

E. KENNEDY, In.<br />\nHopkins students do not seem<br />\nto know how to read or to grasp<br />\nconcepts, according to Mort Rosenberg, Instructor of Political<br />\nScience Elements and counsellor<br />\nof Griffin House.<br />\nHe feels, that, the basis of the<br />\nproblem, is a lack of concentration as well as poor note taking<br />\nand lack of preparation before<br />\nclasses. Students have a passive<br />\nattitude toward their assignments. They are not trying to<br />\ngrasp the essential issues to learn<br />\nbasic facts, to coordinate and<br />\nrelate material. They have a<br />\n\"sit back\" and \"feed me\" attitude which explains their inability to verbalize lecture and<br /><br />\nreading material accurately.<br />\nMr. Rosenberg, graduate of<br />\nHarvard Law school, who finished a year's practice in New<br />\nYork City before coming to Hopkins, uses a method which he<br />\nfeels is the sure cure for student<br />\npassivity\u2014the Socratic method.<br />\nIf students are apathetic, says<br />\nRosenberg, it is not entirely their<br />\nfault. The lecture method used<br />\nalmost exclusively at Hopkins<br />\nfails to demand from the students. This method is adopted,<br />\nhe says, because it is thought to<br />\nbe more adequate for covering a<br />\nlarge amount of material. If,<br />\nhowever, the Socratic method is<br />\nused properly (the way it is used<br />\nat Harvard Law school), more<br />\nmaterial can be covered more<br /><br />\nPlay Review<br /><br />\nO'Neill And Shaw And<br />\nAll Wonderful And Fine<br />\nBy LARRY FELDMAN<br />\nYes, and great and good and<br />\nglorious Saturday night and all<br />\nattended and all were pleased<br />\nand all were happy and great<br />\nGod what glorious fun and<br />\nO'Neill and Shaw and lighting<br />\nand scenery and sound and all<br />\nwonderful.

Each person is a fund of<br />\nknowledge whose participation in<br />\nthe class contributes to constructing, ordering and relating<br />\nthe subject matter. \u2022<br />\nIts purpose is not to expose<br />\nor to ridicule students' ignorance,<br />\nbut to induce them to think for<br />\nthemselves. If someone gives a<br />\nwrong answer, the answer is<br />\nwrong not the student.<br />\nStudent Interest<br />\nStudents, feels Rosenberg, are<br />\ninterested if someone can interest<br />\nthem and stimulate their curiosity. A \"thread\" to connect facts<br />\nis one requisite of an interesting<br />\nclass. Facts without a theme are<br />\nmeaningless and a theme without<br />\nfacts is groundless. Only the<br />\nteacher can supply the theme.<br />\nMr. Rosenberg's method is a<br />\nsure check<br />\nagainst student<br />\napathy and intellectual laziness.<br />\nIt is also a sure check on the<br />\ntendency of some students to<br />\nbecome intellectuals before they<br />\nare students; of floating around<br />\non the \"third level of meaning\"<br />\nbefore understanding or even<br />\noccasionally reading the text.<br /><br />\nealtliedizoodeitce<br />\nWhat A 'Speel'!<br /><br />\ndesiring them and also whether<br />\nor not The Hopkins is especially<br />\nencouraging those prospective<br />\nstudents who would be scared off<br />\nby a possible \"quota\" system or<br />\na possible racist atmosphere and<br />\nenvironment at the Hopkins.<br /><br />\ntruth of your position.<br />\nAccording to your view, we use<br />\nI find the editorial policy of<br />\n\"open negotiation and money\"<br />\nthe News-Letter confusing.

The freshmen were warned by the upperclassmen during Orientation that<br />\nthis was so, but we found it<br />\nhard to believe. It was at the<br />\nfirst football game that the lack<br />\nof spirit first came out of biding<br />\nand showed itself; but the explanation of this was that the<br />\nconstant excuses and apologies<br />\nfor the poor quality of the teams<br />\nby the administration, and even<br />\nthe coaches, didn't instill much<br />\nspirit.

One will have as<br />\nMuch trouble finding it on this<br />\ncampus as he will finding a date<br /><br />\nsonable excuse for the lack of<br />\nparticipation in functions (aside<br />\nfrom drinking contests) that now<br />\nwithin the individual<br />\nexists<br />\nhouses. The most recent, and<br />\ncertainly the most ludicrous<br />\nmanifestation of this dispassion<br />\nwas the Freshmen Election Assembly of last Friday.<br />\nNo matter what the Magnitude.<br />\nany election in which one may<br />\nparticipate demands that the<br />\nvoters get to know the candidates. There is always much discussion about the apathy in the<br />\nnational elections, but this is<br />\npartially excused because most<br />\nof the populace is under-ed-<br /><br />\nPAGE THIRTEEN<br />\nucated. At Hopkins, for obvious<br />\nreasons, this argument cannot<br />\nbe put forth; and<br />\net, if the<br />\nFreshman Election polls equal<br />\nthat which showed itself at the<br />\nAssembly, the elections might<br />\njust as well not be held,<br />\nDespite the fact that the as..<br />\nsembly was on the - Cotillion<br />\nBoard Calendar and that it was<br />\nannounced on WJHU the night<br />\nbefore, the freshmen either<br />\ndidn't care or didn't know about<br />\nthe meeting. As a result there<br />\nwere more candidates (thirtyfour: with one presidential can_<br />\ndidat,e failing to show up) than<br />\nstudents in the audience. The<br /><br />\nnumber in the audience was<br />\nvariable 'thirty-three at its<br />\ngreatest) as a few students would<br />\nget up and leave; and then a<br />\nfew more arrive. Arnie Lehman,<br />\nthe last presidential candidate<br />\ntoo speak, put a fit ending to<br />\nthis farce by making an ambiguous and, at times, wholly<br />\nunintelligable speech for office<br />\nthat caused five confused freshmen to leave. \"The best class in<br />\ntwenty years\" is what the Freshman Class calls itself; but, as<br />\nyet, they have failed to show<br />\nthe spirit necessary to achieve<br />\nthat distinction.<br />\nPaul Shepherd<br /><br />\nwar<br />\n\u201477-7<br /><br />\nes.1.1111mmennis<br /><br />\n---fwedopiwour<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\ntwavolis<br /><br />\nhia\"\"<br /><br />\n1IFI III II<br /><br />\nYou have (or will have) your Ph.D. or Master's Degree<br />\nYOU MAY FIND THAT A MOVE TO MARTIN WILL BE A MOVE UP IN YOUR<br />\nCAREER ...
