The<br />\nAlbert Shaw lectures, which are for<br />\nthe graduate students of the department, but not for the general public, will be delivered by Dr. Frank<br />\nA. Updyke, of the\u2022 University of<br />\nDartmouth. The dates of these lectures have not yet been definitely<br />\nfixea, but they will take place shortly after the beginning of the second<br />\nterm.<br />\nThe James Schouler Foundation<br />\nlecturer for this year is Herr Joset<br />\nRedlich, professor of staatsrecht, or<br />\nconstitutional law, at the University<br />\nof Vienna. He will deliver a series<br />\nof five lectures, from Monday, December 8 to Friday, December 12<br />\n\u2014one each day of the week\u2014in the<br />\nDonovan Room, at five o'clock P.<br />\nM. His general subject will be<br />\n\"The Political Problems of AustriaHungary,\" which he will trace from<br />\nthe time of the break between<br />\nAustria and Prussia and the foundation of the monarchy of AustriaHungary to the present day. Dr.<br />\nRedlich is the first lecturer to appear here under the Schouler Foundation since Professor Schouler<br />\nhimself spoke here two years ago.<br />\nDue to the inability to find a suitable speaker, the course was discontinued last year, so that Dr. Redlich's talks will be followed with interest.<br />\nIn addition to these lectures, the<br />\nHon. Charles Francis Adams, of<br />\nBoston and Washington, will be<br />\nbrought here by the history department to speak on the Civil War, on<br />\nwhich subject he is an authority.<br />\nLast season he delivered a course<br />\nof lectures on this subject at Oxford University, but later on he<br />\nfound so much additional material<br />\nin London that he decided to lecture again on the same general<br />\ntopic.<br />\nThe regular University lecturers<br />\nto be seen here in the near future<br />\nare, likewise, men of note all over<br />\nthe world. As has been announced<br />\nin a previous issue, Dr. Shosuke<br />\nSato, of the University of Tokyo,<br />\nwill be the second of the JapaneseAmerican Exchange lecturers to<br />\nspeak in this country\u2014the first being Dr. Inazo Nitobe, of the same<br />\nuniversity. Dr. Sato will deliver<br />\na course of six lectures dealing with<br />\nJapanese history and government,<br />\nthe first to be held on Tuesday,<br />\nFebruary 24.<br />\n<br />\nThe University musicians are<br />\nstill persevering in their endeavors<br />\nto prepare a good program. Three<br />\nrehearsals were held by the Glee<br />\nClub at the dinner hours and a big<br />\nrehearsal on Saturday morning.<br />\nGreat improvement has ben made,<br />\nespecially in the observance of the<br />\nfiner points of the music. The<br />\nClub still has two pieces to learn<br />\nbefore Christmas, and it will mean<br />\nplenty of hard work. Tenative lists<br />\nof the men who are doing good<br />\nwork are being made, and those<br />\nwho are irregular in attendance,<br />\ninattentive at rehearsals, or whose<br />\nsinging is not up to the Club standard will be gradually eliminated<br />\nfrom the roll. Before any of the<br />\ntrips are taken, it is being planned<br />\nto put each member of the Club<br />\nthrough an individual and single<br />\nrehearsal or examination, to make<br />\nsure that everyorje who goes on<br />\nthe trips will be able to give music<br />\nworthy of Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe instrumentalists are almost<br />\nready for the concerts. They have<br />\nabout mastered their pieces and<br />\nare practicing to make them perfect. Their only need now is several good \"encores.\"<br />\nThe first concert will be held in<br />\nthe chapel of Goucher College, the<br />\nFirst M. E. Church, next Thursday night. The management has<br />\na number of other plans in hand<br />\nfor the winter season. The Christmas trip will probably be made<br />\nDecember 29 to 31 to Chestertown;<br />\nDover, Del., and Salisbury. In<br />\nJanuary a concert is being planned<br />\nfor Sparrows Point, and a trip will<br />\nprobably be made to Tome Institute. The manager also has proposals for a joint concert with the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania in February, but it has not yet been decided whether or not they will be<br />\naccepted. The McCoy Hall concert will likely be given late in<br />\nJanuary or early in February for<br />\nthe benefit of the 1914 \"Hullabaloo.\"<br />\n<br />\nA new book entitled \"The Constitution of Matter,\" by Dr. Joseph<br />\nS. Ames, professor of physics and<br />\ndirector of the Physical Laboratory,<br />\nhas just come from the publishers.<br />\nThe body of the book is formed<br />\nof six lectures which Dr. Ames delivered at Northwestern University, last year. These were given<br />\nunder the lectureship which was<br />\nfounded in 1906 through the generosity of Mr. Norman Wait Harris, a wealthy banker of Chicago.<br />\nThe purpose of the lecture<br />\nfoundation is, as expressed by the<br />\ndonor, \"to stimulate scientific research of the highest type, and to<br />\nbring the results of such research<br />\nbefore the students of Northwestern University, and through them<br />\nto the world.\"<br />\nThe titles of the lectures are:<br />\nI\u2014\"General Properties of Matter; Mass.\"<br />\nII \u2014 \"Corpuscles and Atoms;<br />\nElectrical Mass.\"<br />\nIII \u2014 \"Radio-Activity; Gravitation.\"<br />\nIV\u2014'Radiation; Formation of<br />\nMolecules; Elasticity.\"<br />\nV\u2014\"Properties of Metals; Thermionics; Magnetism.\"<br />\nVI\u2014\"Models of Atoms; Conclusions.\"<br />\nThe fact that they were lectures<br />\naccounts for the form in which the<br />\ntext is given; and the further fact<br />\nthat the audience for whom they<br />\nwere prepared was composed, for<br />\na large part, of people unfamiliar<br />\nwith both the facts and the methods of science, must be accepted<br />\nas the justification of the treatment<br />\nof the subject.<br />\nThe main purpose of the lectures<br />\nwas to make clear to a body of<br />\npeople, not students of physics,<br />\nsome of the results of'investigators<br />\nin unifying our knowledge of the<br />\nworld around us. In book form<br />\nthey should undoubtedly prove interesting to any reader.<br />\n<br />\nThe large number of candidates<br />\nwho presented themselves at the<br />\ntrack team organization meeting<br />\nlast Tuesday afternoon, and the<br />\ngeneral display of enthusiasm and<br />\nspirit which has marked the first<br />\npractices, promises Captain Wagner and Coach England a very encouraging basis to work upon to<br />\ndevelop a successful team for the<br />\ncinder path this season. Between<br />\nsixty and seventy fellows, veterans<br />\nand novices, listened with growing<br />\nspirit to what Captain \"Bod,\" the<br />\ncoach and several other old hands<br />\nat the game had to say to them.<br />\nCaptain Wagner opened the meeting with a short speech, in which he<br />\nexpressed his gratification at the<br />\nlarge number of candidates, and his<br />\nhopes that they would all stick. He<br />\nthen introduced the coach, who laid<br />\nespecial emphasis, in his few remarks, upon the importance in track<br />\nwork of sticking to it day after day,<br />\nweek after week, and perhaps year<br />\nafter year, and the possibilities of<br />\nsurprising results from such earnest<br />\nwork. He said he would leave to<br />\nothers to speak of the pleasures of<br />\ntrack work and tell just a few<br />\nthings that he had always been glad<br />\nwere told him at the beginning of<br />\nhis own track training. Patience<br />\nand perseverance he mentioned as<br />\nthe qualities that count. He then<br />\nurged every man to think df and<br />\nwork for Hopkins first and him:self second always, for team-work<br />\ncounts for a great deal in track as<br />\nin every other sport.<br />\nNext, Manager Dorsey told the<br />\nmen about the schedule that is being<br />\narranged for this season. The<br />\nexact dates have not been set, but<br />\nthe teams the Hopkins men are to<br />\nmeet are practically decided upon.<br />\nThe first contest will be the annual<br />\nindoor freshman - sophomore meet<br />\nto be held the last of January or<br />\nthe first week in February. The<br />\ncustom started last year of holding<br />\nindoor dual meets with different<br />\nathletic clubs of Baltimore will be<br />\ncontinued. A dual meeting with<br />\nMilton University of Baltimore will<br />\nalso be held in .the Hopkins cage.<br />\nThe feature of the indoor season<br />\nas usual will be the annual Fifth<br />\nRegiment Armory meet on February 14. The George Washing<br />\nton meet at Washington and the<br />\nGeorgetown meet will follow this;<br />\nthe latter coming on March 7.

Lazenby was a<br />\nmarvel at tackle, and it was his<br />\nwork that kept St. John's from<br />\nscoring. In the second half, Johns<br />\nHopkins University took a very decided brace and outplayed their opponents. The 'Varsity lost a good<br />\nmany times on fumbles, but with<br />\nthe ball in our possession on St.<br />\nJohn's 30-yard line, Captain Robinson took the ball around St. John's<br />\nleft wing and scored the winning<br />\ntouchdown.

In fact, the passage<br />\nof the resolutions at the mass-meeting last Wednesday would seem to<br />\ndefinitely assert that the undergraduates are willing\u2014yes, anxious<br />\n\u2014to undertake the management of<br />\ntheir own examinations \u2014 the first<br />\nstep in the government of students<br />\nby Students. It is not strange that<br />\nit is distasteful to a student to feel<br />\nthat a professor is watching all<br />\nthrough examinations. Undoubtedly, it is distasteful to the professor,<br />\ntoo, and he will heartily support the<br />\nstudent in saying:\"We do not need<br />\nwatching, we are an honorable body,<br />\nand any student who does not measure up to the standard, we will<br />\nthrow him out!\"<br />\nThe gist of the resolutions which<br />\nwere passed is:<br />\n1. \"That the Student Council<br />\n* ,.* * be recognized to possess<br />\nthe authority to take cognizance of<br />\ncases of dishonesty in examinations<br />\nand to take such action thereon as<br />\n*<br />\nit may deem proper.\" *<br />\n2. \"That the Student Council,<br />\nthough disclaiming the right to lay<br />\non its individual members a * -* *<br />\nbinding mandate of espionage, delation * * * do urge upon them<br />\nnot only the moral justification, but<br />\nthe praiseworthiness and necessity<br />\nas a matter of self-protection to the<br />\nhonor of the student body, * * *<br />\n<br />\nof seeing to it, when assured of the<br />\noccasion of dishonesty in examination, that the Student Council be<br />\nmade aware thereof.\"<br />\n3. ''That the stddent body * * *<br />\nearnestly recommend to its individual members * * * to add<br />\nto examination papers the personal<br />\nassertion that assistance has been<br />\nneither given nor received.\" * * *<br />\nHere is the machinery in case<br />\nflagrant cases of dishonesty ever<br />\ncome to light. Such cases would<br />\ncertainly be noticed by more than<br />\none witness; they would see a member of the Student Council, who<br />\nwould have a meeting of the Council called a n d summary action<br />\nwould be taken if deemed right.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER heartily approves of the resolutions and it<br />\nurges every student to take them to<br />\nheart and get behind them in earnest<br />\nsupport.<br />\nA New University at Homewood?<br />\n<br />\nIt is unfortunate for the University as it is about to move to Homewood that precedents of the undergraduates are being bowled over<br />\nannually. During the last six years<br />\nhazing has been carried on in a<br />\nsecret manner on account of the<br />\nprejudices of the faculty; it has<br />\nled a haunted life with a single<br />\ngrey-bearded ghost dogging along<br />\nat its heels, yet the drastic measures<br />\ninstituted recently may be effective<br />\nin stamping out this custom and depriving the freshmen of what they<br />\nare most proud\u2014of being one of<br />\na few who are gently bathed of a<br />\ndark night in a nearby fountain.<br />\nThree years ago the interclass<br />\ncane rush was held for the last<br />\ntime. No one was hurt, class spirit<br />\nrose to its height, the affair was<br />\nfairly judged by a senior committee; yet we are dumbfounded that<br />\nthis innocent form of amusement<br />\nhas been summarily discontinued.<br />\nOn the following year the so-called<br />\n\"class rush\" was abolished by action<br />\nof a star chamber. This rush becomes a wrestling match two seconds after the whistle blows. The<br />\nundergraduates are taught wrestling by an instructor in the gymnasium ; but we are led to believe<br />\nthat, by prohibiting the use of the<br />\nprinciples in public, which are<br />\nlearned under cover of the gymnasium, the powers that prevail consider wrestling a thing not scholarly,<br />\nor a thing to be hidden like an undergarment, or a thing to arouse<br />\nTeutonic comment?<br />\n\u2022 This is all very well; but the<br />\nlatest stab at our customs is the<br />\nlack this year of the freshmansophomore football game. The<br />\n\"mild disabilities\" imposed upon<br />\nthe sophomore class are in pant the<br />\ncause; the refusal of the Homewood Committee to extend the use<br />\nof the field a week later has been<br />\nanother setback. But before all<br />\nother reasons why the game could<br />\nnot be played, this question must<br />\nbe looked in the face: Is the undergraduate body allowing precedents<br />\nto go by the board without a mur-<br />\n<br />\nmur?<br />\n<br />\ngun<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nCLOTHES<br />\n<br />\nSMART<br />\n<br />\nCLOTHES<br />\n<br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE TO MEASURE<br />\n<br />\nPLAZA BLDG\u2022<br />\n<br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST.<br />\n<br />\na Li<br />\nA111111111111:<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN<br />\n<br />\nLEFRANC & AULT<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE SHOES<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br />\n<br />\nSELL A<br />\n<br />\nThey look well-- fit well\u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br />\n<br />\nWYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br />\n<br />\nGuaranteed Goat Skin Glove<br />\nat $1.00 and $1.50 per pair<br />\nALSO<br />\n<br />\nFOWNES GLOVES<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\n\"SHIRT<br />\n<br />\nSHOP<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\n421 N.

It is now beyond the experimental stage, and rests on the firm<br />\nfoundation of a year's creditable<br />\nresults, so that its future progress<br />\nwill be watched with interest by the<br />\nalumni and students of our University.<br />\nThe first number of the second<br />\nvolume of the Alumni Magazine,<br />\nwhich appeared a few days ago,<br />\nis on a par with last year's issues.<br />\nIn contains several particularly interesting and vital articles. The<br />\neditorial comment, especially that on<br />\nthe selection of a president to fill<br />\nthe vacancy caused by Dr. Remsen's<br />\nresignation almost two years ago,and<br />\nthat on the hazing incident which<br />\nstirred up the whole University<br />\nrecently, is to the point; and its<br />\nUniversity notes are, in the main,<br />\naccurate. The leading article is a<br />\n. Lovejoy of<br />\nstudy by Prof. A. 06<br />\nthe philosophy department, entitled<br />\n\"Some Comparative Statistics Relating to the Graduate Department<br />\nof the University,\" in which the author, in an interesting, but necessarily technical manner, compares<br />\nformer and present conditions existing in the graduate department<br />\nhere, as regards numbers of teachers and students and relative cost<br />\nper student to the University. He<br />\nthen goes on to contrast Hopkins<br />\nwith other universities in these matters, showing that the cost per student here is greater than elsewhere,<br />\nand he comes to the conclusion that<br />\na proper increase in annual expenditure \"would not only permit a<br />\nmarked increase in the University's<br />\nusefulness, but also be an important measure of economy in the administration of educational funds<br />\nin general.\" This study is followed<br />\nby an interesting, though not very<br />\ntimely, article on Sargent's famous<br />\npainting of \"The Four Doctors,\"<br />\nnamely, Drs. Halsted, Kelly, Osler<br />\nand Welch, which was presented to<br />\nthe University in 1907 by Miss Garrett and now stands in the Donovan<br />\nRoom. It contains reminiscences<br />\nof Dr. Welch and Dr. Kelly on<br />\nthe way in which the group was<br />\npainted. In addition to these two<br />\narticles, Dr. Magoffin gives an account of the new Bureau of Appointments and its functions; Dr.<br />\nJohn M. Vincent recounts the origin<br />\nand growth of the American Historical Association and the general<br />\nconnection of this University with<br />\nlearned societies; and Mr. Lindsay<br />\nRogers, A. B. '12, advocates a Bureau of Publicity, such as is found<br />\nin other universities. Finally, the<br />\nmagazine contains three short articles: An outline of the progress at<br />\nHomewood during the summer, by<br />\nMr. W. G.

Johnston, of Pittsburgh, also a senior, by the Faculty Committee on Student Affairs.<br />\n- Complaints of alleged too up-to-date<br />\nreading matter and suggestive cartoons<br />\nand sketches were laid before the faculty,<br />\nin part, it is alleged, by members of the<br />\nCornell Somerset Y., a temperance society<br />\namong the students which was made the<br />\nbutt of ridicule in the Widow's editorials,<br />\nand by certain members of the faculty,<br />\nThere is a strong undergraduate sentiment in favor of an appeal for the two<br />\nstudents, both of whom are prominent in<br />\nthe university community.<br />\nThe cover of the \"temptation number\"<br />\ndepicted a scantily clad, good looking<br />\nyoung woman tickling the chin of a sombre<br />\ngarbed gentleman wearing long whiskers.<br />\nThe frontispiece depicted a charming<br />\nyoung woman in her night robe about to<br />\ngo to bed, with this reading matter: \"Because I'm in my nighty, and am of tender<br />\nage, oh, leave me to my modesty and<br />\nquickly turn the page.\"<br />\nThe leading editorial was a condemnation of the reformers who voted to have<br />\nclass banquets dry.<br />\n<br />\nShades of Lydia Pinkham! The<br />\nvice crusaders are even after the<br />\ncollege editors and publications.<br />\nWouldn't it show a sufficient regard<br />\nfor virtue if the faculty waited to<br />\nsee whether the federal authorities<br />\ncharged a misuse of the mails?<br />\nI sincerely trust that THE NEWSLETTER exchanges with The Widow. Recollections of .Life's improper number and the Harvard<br />\nLampoon's famous cartoon of the<br />\nRev. Dr. Lyman Abbott and Mlle.<br />\nEva Tanguay, both delightfully<br />\ndeshabilks, are fresh in my memory.<br />\nIf THE NEWS -LETTER has the<br />\ntempting Widow, can't it be placed<br />\nin Levering Hall with an asbestos<br />\nprotection? Not to be read. Oh!<br />\nof course not\u2014to heat coffee on<br />\nat the lunch hour.<br />\nMay I, in conclusion, get a platitudinous, if not a particularly germane, moral off my chest? At<br />\nHopkins, THE NEWS-LETTER, several times within my recollection,<br />\nhas come near deeply injuring the<br />\ntender feelings of certain professors by remarks which were entirely innocuous and which at other<br />\ncolleges, where there is more<br />\nundergraduate spirit, would have<br />\npassed absolutely unnoticed. My<br />\nmoral, then, is this: When a student paper pokes fun at a pedagogue with the best of spirit, the<br />\nsubject ought to smile and be flattered; when the fun is vindictive,<br />\nhe ought to be a big enough man<br />\nto pass it over in silence. Examples of big and little men here<br />\ncould be given, but why inveigle<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER into difficulties?<br />\nI have too high a regard for its<br />\ncharming and efficient editor-inchtef.<br />\nG.

Francis Adams,Dr.Sato and<br />\nProf. Kittredge Will Speak.<br /><br />\nCut Made in Glee Club Ranks\u2014Concert<br />\nWith U. of P.

The<br />\nAlbert Shaw lectures, which are for<br />\nthe graduate students of the department, but not for the general public, will be delivered by Dr. Frank<br />\nA. Updyke, of the\u2022 University of<br />\nDartmouth. The dates of these lectures have not yet been definitely<br />\nfixea, but they will take place shortly after the beginning of the second<br />\nterm.<br />\nThe James Schouler Foundation<br />\nlecturer for this year is Herr Joset<br />\nRedlich, professor of staatsrecht, or<br />\nconstitutional law, at the University<br />\nof Vienna. He will deliver a series<br />\nof five lectures, from Monday, December 8 to Friday, December 12<br />\n\u2014one each day of the week\u2014in the<br />\nDonovan Room, at five o'clock P.<br />\nM. His general subject will be<br />\n\"The Political Problems of AustriaHungary,\" which he will trace from<br />\nthe time of the break between<br />\nAustria and Prussia and the foundation of the monarchy of AustriaHungary to the present day. Dr.<br />\nRedlich is the first lecturer to appear here under the Schouler Foundation since Professor Schouler<br />\nhimself spoke here two years ago.<br />\nDue to the inability to find a suitable speaker, the course was discontinued last year, so that Dr. Redlich's talks will be followed with interest.<br />\nIn addition to these lectures, the<br />\nHon. Charles Francis Adams, of<br />\nBoston and Washington, will be<br />\nbrought here by the history department to speak on the Civil War, on<br />\nwhich subject he is an authority.<br />\nLast season he delivered a course<br />\nof lectures on this subject at Oxford University, but later on he<br />\nfound so much additional material<br />\nin London that he decided to lecture again on the same general<br />\ntopic.<br />\nThe regular University lecturers<br />\nto be seen here in the near future<br />\nare, likewise, men of note all over<br />\nthe world. As has been announced<br />\nin a previous issue, Dr. Shosuke<br />\nSato, of the University of Tokyo,<br />\nwill be the second of the JapaneseAmerican Exchange lecturers to<br />\nspeak in this country\u2014the first being Dr. Inazo Nitobe, of the same<br />\nuniversity. Dr. Sato will deliver<br />\na course of six lectures dealing with<br />\nJapanese history and government,<br />\nthe first to be held on Tuesday,<br />\nFebruary 24.<br /><br />\nThe University musicians are<br />\nstill persevering in their endeavors<br />\nto prepare a good program. Three<br />\nrehearsals were held by the Glee<br />\nClub at the dinner hours and a big<br />\nrehearsal on Saturday morning.<br />\nGreat improvement has ben made,<br />\nespecially in the observance of the<br />\nfiner points of the music. The<br />\nClub still has two pieces to learn<br />\nbefore Christmas, and it will mean<br />\nplenty of hard work. Tenative lists<br />\nof the men who are doing good<br />\nwork are being made, and those<br />\nwho are irregular in attendance,<br />\ninattentive at rehearsals, or whose<br />\nsinging is not up to the Club standard will be gradually eliminated<br />\nfrom the roll. Before any of the<br />\ntrips are taken, it is being planned<br />\nto put each member of the Club<br />\nthrough an individual and single<br />\nrehearsal or examination, to make<br />\nsure that everyorje who goes on<br />\nthe trips will be able to give music<br />\nworthy of Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe instrumentalists are almost<br />\nready for the concerts. They have<br />\nabout mastered their pieces and<br />\nare practicing to make them perfect. Their only need now is several good \"encores.\"<br />\nThe first concert will be held in<br />\nthe chapel of Goucher College, the<br />\nFirst M. E. Church, next Thursday night. The management has<br />\na number of other plans in hand<br />\nfor the winter season. The Christmas trip will probably be made<br />\nDecember 29 to 31 to Chestertown;<br />\nDover, Del., and Salisbury. In<br />\nJanuary a concert is being planned<br />\nfor Sparrows Point, and a trip will<br />\nprobably be made to Tome Institute. The manager also has proposals for a joint concert with the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania in February, but it has not yet been decided whether or not they will be<br />\naccepted. The McCoy Hall concert will likely be given late in<br />\nJanuary or early in February for<br />\nthe benefit of the 1914 \"Hullabaloo.\"<br /><br />\nA new book entitled \"The Constitution of Matter,\" by Dr. Joseph<br />\nS. Ames, professor of physics and<br />\ndirector of the Physical Laboratory,<br />\nhas just come from the publishers.<br />\nThe body of the book is formed<br />\nof six lectures which Dr. Ames delivered at Northwestern University, last year. These were given<br />\nunder the lectureship which was<br />\nfounded in 1906 through the generosity of Mr. Norman Wait Harris, a wealthy banker of Chicago.<br />\nThe purpose of the lecture<br />\nfoundation is, as expressed by the<br />\ndonor, \"to stimulate scientific research of the highest type, and to<br />\nbring the results of such research<br />\nbefore the students of Northwestern University, and through them<br />\nto the world.\"<br />\nThe titles of the lectures are:<br />\nI\u2014\"General Properties of Matter; Mass.\"<br />\nII \u2014 \"Corpuscles and Atoms;<br />\nElectrical Mass.\"<br />\nIII \u2014 \"Radio-Activity; Gravitation.\"<br />\nIV\u2014'Radiation; Formation of<br />\nMolecules; Elasticity.\"<br />\nV\u2014\"Properties of Metals; Thermionics; Magnetism.\"<br />\nVI\u2014\"Models of Atoms; Conclusions.\"<br />\nThe fact that they were lectures<br />\naccounts for the form in which the<br />\ntext is given; and the further fact<br />\nthat the audience for whom they<br />\nwere prepared was composed, for<br />\na large part, of people unfamiliar<br />\nwith both the facts and the methods of science, must be accepted<br />\nas the justification of the treatment<br />\nof the subject.<br />\nThe main purpose of the lectures<br />\nwas to make clear to a body of<br />\npeople, not students of physics,<br />\nsome of the results of'investigators<br />\nin unifying our knowledge of the<br />\nworld around us. In book form<br />\nthey should undoubtedly prove interesting to any reader.<br /><br />\nThe large number of candidates<br />\nwho presented themselves at the<br />\ntrack team organization meeting<br />\nlast Tuesday afternoon, and the<br />\ngeneral display of enthusiasm and<br />\nspirit which has marked the first<br />\npractices, promises Captain Wagner and Coach England a very encouraging basis to work upon to<br />\ndevelop a successful team for the<br />\ncinder path this season. Between<br />\nsixty and seventy fellows, veterans<br />\nand novices, listened with growing<br />\nspirit to what Captain \"Bod,\" the<br />\ncoach and several other old hands<br />\nat the game had to say to them.<br />\nCaptain Wagner opened the meeting with a short speech, in which he<br />\nexpressed his gratification at the<br />\nlarge number of candidates, and his<br />\nhopes that they would all stick. He<br />\nthen introduced the coach, who laid<br />\nespecial emphasis, in his few remarks, upon the importance in track<br />\nwork of sticking to it day after day,<br />\nweek after week, and perhaps year<br />\nafter year, and the possibilities of<br />\nsurprising results from such earnest<br />\nwork. He said he would leave to<br />\nothers to speak of the pleasures of<br />\ntrack work and tell just a few<br />\nthings that he had always been glad<br />\nwere told him at the beginning of<br />\nhis own track training. Patience<br />\nand perseverance he mentioned as<br />\nthe qualities that count. He then<br />\nurged every man to think df and<br />\nwork for Hopkins first and him:self second always, for team-work<br />\ncounts for a great deal in track as<br />\nin every other sport.<br />\nNext, Manager Dorsey told the<br />\nmen about the schedule that is being<br />\narranged for this season. The<br />\nexact dates have not been set, but<br />\nthe teams the Hopkins men are to<br />\nmeet are practically decided upon.<br />\nThe first contest will be the annual<br />\nindoor freshman - sophomore meet<br />\nto be held the last of January or<br />\nthe first week in February. The<br />\ncustom started last year of holding<br />\nindoor dual meets with different<br />\nathletic clubs of Baltimore will be<br />\ncontinued. A dual meeting with<br />\nMilton University of Baltimore will<br />\nalso be held in .the Hopkins cage.<br />\nThe feature of the indoor season<br />\nas usual will be the annual Fifth<br />\nRegiment Armory meet on February 14. The George Washing<br />\nton meet at Washington and the<br />\nGeorgetown meet will follow this;<br />\nthe latter coming on March 7. The<br />\noutdoor season will include dual<br />\nmeets with Navy, Swarthmore, Carlisle and Virginia, for none of<br />\nwhich the dates have been definitely<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br /><br />\nHONOR SYSTEM IN NEXT EXAMS.<br />\nStudents asked to<br />\nno more patrolling<br />\nMen asked to add<br />\nassertion that they<br /><br />\nlend their hearty support.

The half closed with St.<br />\nJohn's in possession of the ball on<br />\ntheir 40-yard line. Lazenby was a<br />\nmarvel at tackle, and it was his<br />\nwork that kept St. John's from<br />\nscoring. In the second half, Johns<br />\nHopkins University took a very decided brace and outplayed their opponents. The 'Varsity lost a good<br />\nmany times on fumbles, but with<br />\nthe ball in our possession on St.<br />\nJohn's 30-yard line, Captain Robinson took the ball around St. John's<br />\nleft wing and scored the winning<br />\ntouchdown.

In fact, the passage<br />\nof the resolutions at the mass-meeting last Wednesday would seem to<br />\ndefinitely assert that the undergraduates are willing\u2014yes, anxious<br />\n\u2014to undertake the management of<br />\ntheir own examinations \u2014 the first<br />\nstep in the government of students<br />\nby Students. It is not strange that<br />\nit is distasteful to a student to feel<br />\nthat a professor is watching all<br />\nthrough examinations. Undoubtedly, it is distasteful to the professor,<br />\ntoo, and he will heartily support the<br />\nstudent in saying:\"We do not need<br />\nwatching, we are an honorable body,<br />\nand any student who does not measure up to the standard, we will<br />\nthrow him out!\"<br />\nThe gist of the resolutions which<br />\nwere passed is:<br />\n1. \"That the Student Council<br />\n* ,.* * be recognized to possess<br />\nthe authority to take cognizance of<br />\ncases of dishonesty in examinations<br />\nand to take such action thereon as<br />\n*<br />\nit may deem proper.\" *<br />\n2. \"That the Student Council,<br />\nthough disclaiming the right to lay<br />\non its individual members a * -* *<br />\nbinding mandate of espionage, delation * * * do urge upon them<br />\nnot only the moral justification, but<br />\nthe praiseworthiness and necessity<br />\nas a matter of self-protection to the<br />\nhonor of the student body, * * *<br /><br />\nof seeing to it, when assured of the<br />\noccasion of dishonesty in examination, that the Student Council be<br />\nmade aware thereof.\"<br />\n3. ''That the stddent body * * *<br />\nearnestly recommend to its individual members * * * to add<br />\nto examination papers the personal<br />\nassertion that assistance has been<br />\nneither given nor received.\" * * *<br />\nHere is the machinery in case<br />\nflagrant cases of dishonesty ever<br />\ncome to light. Such cases would<br />\ncertainly be noticed by more than<br />\none witness; they would see a member of the Student Council, who<br />\nwould have a meeting of the Council called a n d summary action<br />\nwould be taken if deemed right.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER heartily approves of the resolutions and it<br />\nurges every student to take them to<br />\nheart and get behind them in earnest<br />\nsupport.<br />\nA New University at Homewood?<br /><br />\nIt is unfortunate for the University as it is about to move to Homewood that precedents of the undergraduates are being bowled over<br />\nannually. During the last six years<br />\nhazing has been carried on in a<br />\nsecret manner on account of the<br />\nprejudices of the faculty; it has<br />\nled a haunted life with a single<br />\ngrey-bearded ghost dogging along<br />\nat its heels, yet the drastic measures<br />\ninstituted recently may be effective<br />\nin stamping out this custom and depriving the freshmen of what they<br />\nare most proud\u2014of being one of<br />\na few who are gently bathed of a<br />\ndark night in a nearby fountain.<br />\nThree years ago the interclass<br />\ncane rush was held for the last<br />\ntime. No one was hurt, class spirit<br />\nrose to its height, the affair was<br />\nfairly judged by a senior committee; yet we are dumbfounded that<br />\nthis innocent form of amusement<br />\nhas been summarily discontinued.<br />\nOn the following year the so-called<br />\n\"class rush\" was abolished by action<br />\nof a star chamber. This rush becomes a wrestling match two seconds after the whistle blows. The<br />\nundergraduates are taught wrestling by an instructor in the gymnasium ; but we are led to believe<br />\nthat, by prohibiting the use of the<br />\nprinciples in public, which are<br />\nlearned under cover of the gymnasium, the powers that prevail consider wrestling a thing not scholarly,<br />\nor a thing to be hidden like an undergarment, or a thing to arouse<br />\nTeutonic comment?<br />\n\u2022 This is all very well; but the<br />\nlatest stab at our customs is the<br />\nlack this year of the freshmansophomore football game. The<br />\n\"mild disabilities\" imposed upon<br />\nthe sophomore class are in pant the<br />\ncause; the refusal of the Homewood Committee to extend the use<br />\nof the field a week later has been<br />\nanother setback. But before all<br />\nother reasons why the game could<br />\nnot be played, this question must<br />\nbe looked in the face: Is the undergraduate body allowing precedents<br />\nto go by the board without a mur-<br /><br />\nmur?<br /><br />\ngun<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nCLOTHES<br /><br />\nSMART<br /><br />\nCLOTHES<br /><br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE TO MEASURE<br /><br />\nPLAZA BLDG\u2022<br /><br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST.<br /><br />\na Li<br />\nA111111111111:<br /><br />\nWYMAN<br /><br />\nLEFRANC &amp; AULT<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE SHOES<br />\nFOR<br />\nCOLLEGE MEN<br /><br />\nSELL A<br /><br />\nThey look well-- fit well\u2014wear well.<br />\nWe guarantee satisfaction<br />\nThe YALE<br />\n$4.00<br />\nThe PRINCETON<br />\n4.50<br />\nThe ENGLISH<br />\n5.00<br />\nThe MARYLAND (broad toe) 5.00<br /><br />\nWYMAN, 19 Lexington St.<br /><br />\nGuaranteed Goat Skin Glove<br />\nat $1.00 and $1.50 per pair<br />\nALSO<br /><br />\nFOWNES GLOVES<br />\nTHE<br /><br />\n\"SHIRT<br /><br />\nSHOP<br />\n\"<br /><br />\n421 N.

It is now beyond the experimental stage, and rests on the firm<br />\nfoundation of a year's creditable<br />\nresults, so that its future progress<br />\nwill be watched with interest by the<br />\nalumni and students of our University.<br />\nThe first number of the second<br />\nvolume of the Alumni Magazine,<br />\nwhich appeared a few days ago,<br />\nis on a par with last year's issues.<br />\nIn contains several particularly interesting and vital articles. The<br />\neditorial comment, especially that on<br />\nthe selection of a president to fill<br />\nthe vacancy caused by Dr. Remsen's<br />\nresignation almost two years ago,and<br />\nthat on the hazing incident which<br />\nstirred up the whole University<br />\nrecently, is to the point; and its<br />\nUniversity notes are, in the main,<br />\naccurate. The leading article is a<br />\n. Lovejoy of<br />\nstudy by Prof. A. 06<br />\nthe philosophy department, entitled<br />\n\"Some Comparative Statistics Relating to the Graduate Department<br />\nof the University,\" in which the author, in an interesting, but necessarily technical manner, compares<br />\nformer and present conditions existing in the graduate department<br />\nhere, as regards numbers of teachers and students and relative cost<br />\nper student to the University. He<br />\nthen goes on to contrast Hopkins<br />\nwith other universities in these matters, showing that the cost per student here is greater than elsewhere,<br />\nand he comes to the conclusion that<br />\na proper increase in annual expenditure \"would not only permit a<br />\nmarked increase in the University's<br />\nusefulness, but also be an important measure of economy in the administration of educational funds<br />\nin general.\" This study is followed<br />\nby an interesting, though not very<br />\ntimely, article on Sargent's famous<br />\npainting of \"The Four Doctors,\"<br />\nnamely, Drs. Halsted, Kelly, Osler<br />\nand Welch, which was presented to<br />\nthe University in 1907 by Miss Garrett and now stands in the Donovan<br />\nRoom. It contains reminiscences<br />\nof Dr. Welch and Dr. Kelly on<br />\nthe way in which the group was<br />\npainted. In addition to these two<br />\narticles, Dr. Magoffin gives an account of the new Bureau of Appointments and its functions; Dr.<br />\nJohn M. Vincent recounts the origin<br />\nand growth of the American Historical Association and the general<br />\nconnection of this University with<br />\nlearned societies; and Mr. Lindsay<br />\nRogers, A. B. '12, advocates a Bureau of Publicity, such as is found<br />\nin other universities. Finally, the<br />\nmagazine contains three short articles: An outline of the progress at<br />\nHomewood during the summer, by<br />\nMr. W. G.

Y., Wednesday\u2014The \"temptation number\" of the Cornell Widow, the<br />\nhuniorous magazine printed monthly by<br />\nCornell undergraduates, has caused the<br />\nsuspension of the editor-in-chief, Austin G.<br />\nParker, of Helena, Mont., a senior in the<br />\nArts College, and to the placing on probation of Archibald B. Johnston, of Pittsburgh, also a senior, by the Faculty Committee on Student Affairs.<br />\n- Complaints of alleged too up-to-date<br />\nreading matter and suggestive cartoons<br />\nand sketches were laid before the faculty,<br />\nin part, it is alleged, by members of the<br />\nCornell Somerset Y., a temperance society<br />\namong the students which was made the<br />\nbutt of ridicule in the Widow's editorials,<br />\nand by certain members of the faculty,<br />\nThere is a strong undergraduate sentiment in favor of an appeal for the two<br />\nstudents, both of whom are prominent in<br />\nthe university community.<br />\nThe cover of the \"temptation number\"<br />\ndepicted a scantily clad, good looking<br />\nyoung woman tickling the chin of a sombre<br />\ngarbed gentleman wearing long whiskers.<br />\nThe frontispiece depicted a charming<br />\nyoung woman in her night robe about to<br />\ngo to bed, with this reading matter: \"Because I'm in my nighty, and am of tender<br />\nage, oh, leave me to my modesty and<br />\nquickly turn the page.\"<br />\nThe leading editorial was a condemnation of the reformers who voted to have<br />\nclass banquets dry.<br /><br />\nShades of Lydia Pinkham! The<br />\nvice crusaders are even after the<br />\ncollege editors and publications.<br />\nWouldn't it show a sufficient regard<br />\nfor virtue if the faculty waited to<br />\nsee whether the federal authorities<br />\ncharged a misuse of the mails?<br />\nI sincerely trust that THE NEWSLETTER exchanges with The Widow. Recollections of .Life's improper number and the Harvard<br />\nLampoon's famous cartoon of the<br />\nRev. Dr. Lyman Abbott and Mlle.<br />\nEva Tanguay, both delightfully<br />\ndeshabilks, are fresh in my memory.<br />\nIf THE NEWS -LETTER has the<br />\ntempting Widow, can't it be placed<br />\nin Levering Hall with an asbestos<br />\nprotection? Not to be read. Oh!<br />\nof course not\u2014to heat coffee on<br />\nat the lunch hour.<br />\nMay I, in conclusion, get a platitudinous, if not a particularly germane, moral off my chest? At<br />\nHopkins, THE NEWS-LETTER, several times within my recollection,<br />\nhas come near deeply injuring the<br />\ntender feelings of certain professors by remarks which were entirely innocuous and which at other<br />\ncolleges, where there is more<br />\nundergraduate spirit, would have<br />\npassed absolutely unnoticed. My<br />\nmoral, then, is this: When a student paper pokes fun at a pedagogue with the best of spirit, the<br />\nsubject ought to smile and be flattered; when the fun is vindictive,<br />\nhe ought to be a big enough man<br />\nto pass it over in silence.
