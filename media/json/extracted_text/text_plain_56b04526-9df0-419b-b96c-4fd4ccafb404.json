He says<br />\nthey were \"screaming as loud as<br />\nthey could, 'get off the bus or<br />\nwe'll throw you off.\" Warren<br />\nadmits that the riders' response<br />\nwas,\"if they didn't get down (to<br />\nEast Baltimore) why should<br />\nanyone get down\" and that<br />\nthere was \"verbal abuse back<br />\nand forth.\" He thinks \"there<br />\nshould have been an attempt to<br />\nreach an equitable solution, \"<br />\nsuch as asking those who had<br />\njust arrived to wait, or putting<br />\nthe University van into service.<br />\nDr. Paul McHugh, Director<br />\n<br />\nAthletic Center<br />\nStiffens Security<br />\n<br />\nWJHU To Be FM<br />\n<br />\nSkinner<br />\nSpeaks<br />\n<br />\nJanitor Hours Proposed<br />\n<br />\nConduct Code<br />\nRedrafted<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4 I FEBRUARY 23, 1979<br />\n<br />\n1The Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews Letter<br />\nThe News-Letter is published weekly during the school<br />\nyear by the students of the Johns Hopkins University.

Ono<br />\n<br />\nReefer Reform 'letters to the editorl<br />\nIt is a strange paradox that the increased use of the<br />\ndrug cannabis among \"respectable\" middle-class citizens<br />\nseems if anything to have led to a more complacent<br />\nattitude toward the law forbidding the possession of<br />\nmarijuana. But in the words of national NORML director<br />\nLarry Schott, \"Pot has become so commonplace, it's not a<br />\ncultural symbol any more.\"<br />\nYet the outlawed status of marijuana remains one of<br />\nthe biggest single travesties perpetrated by the government<br />\non our society today. The official hypocrisy engendered<br />\nby the current situation rivals the disastrous spectacle of<br />\nProhibition. The frequent and flagrant flouting of the<br />\nmarijuana law not only weakens the moral force of that<br />\nparticular statute, it also subverts respect for the role of<br />\nlaw in an entire generation of citizens. Such a trend<br />\ncannot be tolerated; no society can be strong unless the<br />\nlaws it establishes are enforced and observed to the fullest<br />\nextent by its good members.<br />\nIn spite of the widespread disregard for the penalties<br />\nconcerning cannabis consumption, the law takes a heavy<br />\ntoll. Over 470,000 people were arrested in this country last<br />\nyear on such charges, an all-time high. Of these cases, 90%<br />\nwere for simple possession. The continued illegitimacy of<br />\nmarijuana makes respectable citizenship quite tenuous for<br />\nanyone who uses the drug.<br />\nThere are no solid reasons why growing, owning, and<br />\nsmoking pot should remain illegal. The short-term effects<br />\nof the drug are in many respects comparable to those of<br />\nalcohol, which is allowed. However, it is much less disruptive of physical coordination, and there is no unpleasant<br />\nafter-effect\u2014read hangover. Neither have harmful long-term<br />\neffects been proven for moderate marijuana users. Used to<br />\nexcess, like alcohol, cigarettes, or even food, it can wreck a<br />\nlife.<br />\nIn any case, since marijuana affects only people who<br />\nchoose to use it, our government has no sacred right to<br />\nforbid the substance. Of course, in one important situation<br />\na person's decision to get high could affect others, that is,<br />\nwhen that person is planning to drive an automobile. A<br />\nsimple test has fortunately been devised to detect .drivers<br />\nunder the influence of marijuana. Such \"high driving\"<br />\nshould be subject to severe penalties just like drunk driving<br />\nnow is.<br />\nThe so-callocd \"decriminalization\" of marijuana which<br />\nhas been introduced into some jurisdictions is but a<br />\ncompromising solution at best. Traffic-sized fines for<br />\nmarijuana violations arc even more hypocritical then the<br />\npresent system, if that is possible. Only with total legalizadon of the distribution and possession of cannabis products can our society return to a sane. rational course.<br />\n<br />\nBlizzard Bedlam<br />\n'I'LL BE PUTTIN'IN A LOT OF OVERTIME IN NOVEMBER.'<br />\n<br />\nDrivel<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt is with humble sincerity<br />\nthat I submit this apology to<br />\nanyone who might have misconstrued the intent of my<br />\nprevious letter (Hicks, January<br />\n26 issue). I am from a small<br />\ntown in West Virginia where one<br />\ncould not spit down Main street<br />\non breezy day without hitting<br />\none of my relatives. Needless to<br />\nsay, any \"degrading\" remarks<br />\npertaining to Mountain people<br />\nwere strictly unintentional.<br />\nI was taken aback, however,<br />\nat the suppressive tone of \"Slur<br />\nStir\" (February 9 issue). It is<br />\nmy understanding that the first<br />\namendment to the Constitution<br />\n(an excellent document, and I<br />\nrecommend that those responsible for \"Slur Stir\" subject it to<br />\nperusal some evening when not<br />\nout crusading) guarantees that<br />\nfreedom of the press shall not be<br />\nabridged. I expect that the<br />\ncomposers of this illiberal epistle<br />\nadvocate censorship of the<br />\nNews-Letter (themselves to be<br />\nthe censors, no doubt).<br />\n\"Slur Stir\" might be passed<br />\noff as well intentioned drivel if it<br />\ndid not contain implicit advocation of suppression of the free<br />\npress. The News-Letter is to be<br />\ncommended for its willingness to<br />\nprint even so reactionary an<br />\nopinion.<br />\nGeorge Stanton<br />\n<br />\nWay Out<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nYou know, if some things<br />\nweren't worth taking a stand for,<br />\nit wouldn't make a bit of difference what the administration<br />\ndid to the Hopkins custodial<br />\nschedule...or what happened to<br />\nRic Pfeffer...or how many<br />\npeople were exterminated under<br />\nMao Tse-Tung's regime...or how<br />\na nation once begged to have a<br />\nmurderer released to them that<br />\nthey might crucify an innocent<br />\nman.<br />\nAnd when there isn't a<br />\nsufficient portion of the population willing to take a stand<br />\nagainst such injustices, they go<br />\non and on, leaving succeeding<br />\ngenerations to clean up the mess.<br />\nYet the guilt falls not solely into<br />\nthe 'hands of those who perpetrate deceit, but also into the<br />\nhands of those who. stand idly<br />\nby. supposing that they are not<br />\naffected, nor responsible for<br />\ntheir own destiny.<br />\nAs for myself, it would be<br />\nbut a simple thing to shrug my<br />\nshoulders, finish writing my<br />\nthesis, and disappear into the<br />\nsunset, never again having to<br />\n<br />\nconcern myself with Hopkins or<br />\nthe Twig fellowship I've coordinated here for the past few<br />\nyears...And then it wouldn't<br />\nmake a bit of difference what<br />\nDaisy Taylor wrote in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter about The<br />\nWay.<br />\nBut that's not the course I<br />\nchoose to follow. It's not that<br />\nI'm so eminently noble, or<br />\nexceedingly virtuous, or endowed with wisdom that will<br />\nperish with my demise. Nor is it<br />\nthat I follow The Way with<br />\n\"blind devotion\", and have sold<br />\nmy soul to but a vain endeavor,<br />\nrelishing in continual deceit of<br />\nmy colleagues and peers, for I<br />\nam none of the above.<br />\nYet I have taken a stand,<br />\nand will not begin to presume<br />\nthat I have not the responsibility<br />\nto stLe what I know is true. I<br />\ntrust that those who were<br />\ninterested enough to read Ms.<br />\nTaylor's article will give at least<br />\nequal consideration to this point<br />\nof view.<br />\nThis is not a complaint, nor<br />\nan attempt to set the record<br />\nstraight. The article stands on<br />\nits own merits, or falls by its<br />\nlack thereof.<br />\nIn the same<br />\nrespect, if what we of The Way<br />\nbelieve and teach is truth, it will<br />\nbear witness of itself.<br />\nAnd so, we could close the<br />\nbooks on the article right here,<br />\nallowing those who revere NewsLetter authority to believe every<br />\nlast line with \"unquestioned<br />\ndevotion\", and leaving everyone<br />\nelse to come and see for themselves what The Way is really all<br />\nabout if they're genuinely interested, or to stay at home if they<br />\naren't.<br />\nBut as we lay to rest an<br />\narticle that is either a brilliant<br />\nexpose or one of the most<br />\nludicrous pieces of yellow journalism ever published, permit me<br />\nto voice for ponderance a few<br />\nquestions I find difficult to<br />\nreconcile ill my mind.<br />\nThe first of these surely has<br />\nmore than myself perplexed,<br />\nthat is, why the News-Letter<br />\nwould go to such lengths and<br />\nspend so much time taking a<br />\ncrack at a student organization<br />\nwhich it obviously feels is having<br />\nlittle or no impact on campus<br />\nanyway. Judging from the contents of last week's issue, I<br />\ndaresay you have more profitable ways to spend your time,<br />\nlike covering items of wider<br />\nstudent interest, describing<br />\nporno flicks, and publishing such<br />\nthings as guides to sleazy living<br />\nreplete with the most edifying of<br />\nphotographs.<br />\nAnd just for the record, you<br />\nmight want to clarify which<br />\nstudents say \"No Way to The<br />\nWay.\" Were they an accurate<br />\nrepresentation of the hundreds<br />\nof members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity who have attended<br />\n<br />\nTwig fellowships over the past<br />\nseveral years and those who have<br />\ntaken the Power For Abundant<br />\nLiving class?<br />\nOr were you<br />\nreferring to the handful or so<br />\nMs. Taylor dug out of those<br />\ndiscontent to interview?<br />\nAnd merely because I consider it humorous, perhaps you<br />\ncould explain why someone<br />\nwho described herself as an<br />\navowed atheist would put in<br />\nsuch a nice plug for the Hopkins<br />\nChristian Fellowship at the end<br />\nof her article. If I were in with<br />\nthe IV boys, I'd look askance at<br />\nsuch a promotion...it's almost<br />\nlike Hitler recommending the<br />\nlocal synagogue for spiritual<br />\nenlightenment.<br />\nWhile you reflect on these<br />\npoints of query, there's a possibility you might also like to<br />\nconsider this--The Way is a<br />\nfellowship of the followers of<br />\nthe Lord Jesus Christ for the<br />\nmanifestation of the more abundant life. And we never said<br />\nthat means having piles .of<br />\nmoney. What it does mean is<br />\nanswers, it means keys and<br />\nprinciples that anyone can know<br />\nand operate, it means living life<br />\nthe way it was designed to be<br />\nlived. And for that kind of<br />\nknowledge you've got to go to<br />\nthe source, God and His Word.<br />\nWe've never said that we<br />\nhave ALL the answers, or that<br />\nwe've cornered the market on<br />\ntruth. What we have said is that<br />\nwe endeavor to rightly divide the<br />\nWord of God so that we can find<br />\nanswers. Hey, aren't you tired<br />\nof guessing?<br />\nThere's a lot more to be<br />\nsaid, and we are going to continue saying it. Those that have<br />\nears to hear, let THEM hear, and<br />\nfor those that don't, they can let<br />\ntheir kids figure it out.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nSue Matesic<br />\nThe Way Campus Outreach<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nI would just like to thank<br />\nMiss Resnick for the insights she<br />\nprovided in her brilliant piece of<br />\ncommentary concerning the<br />\nNews-Letter editorial on national health insurance.<br />\nThe points she makes about<br />\nthe distance doctors travel to see<br />\ntheir patients and the length of<br />\ntime they are forced to spend in<br />\ntheir treatment go a long way<br />\ntoward proving the wisdom of<br />\nan old saw: History majors<br />\nknow nothing about economics.<br />\nThe public might also take<br />\nsome enlightenment from the<br />\nfact that Miss Resnick's father<br />\nhappens to be a prominent<br />\nPhiladelphia cardiologist.<br />\nRoscoe Richards '79<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER 1 PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\n10% OFF<br />\n<br />\n10% OFF<br />\n<br />\n10% OFF<br />\n<br />\nINTERMITIOTIAL rELLOWS LECTURE SERIES<br />\n<br />\nnustrrrs<br />\n<br />\nALL JOHNS HOPIUNS UNIVERSITY PRESS<br />\nPAPERBACKS IN STOCK<br />\nAT THE JHU BOOKCENTER<br />\n<br />\nFINLAND: Between<br />\nEast and West<br />\nrulTurtinci<br />\nMs. Aila Laitinen<br />\nTampere University, Finland<br />\n<br />\nWednesday, February 28th at 7 P.M.<br />\nin the Board Room of Shriver Hall<br />\n<br />\nSale extended 2 weeks....<br />\n<br />\nWine and cheese will be served<br />\n<br />\nNOW THRU MONDAY, MARCH 19<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nJ.H.U.

Gi<br />\nI've got a great new idea for a hit T.V. series. It'll<br />\nbe about the antics of a zany bunch of students (in a<br />\nprestigious university of a major Northeastern metropolitan area) who are trying to run a radio station and<br />\npass all their courses at the same time. It can't miss. It's<br />\na natural situation comedy.<br />\nSituation comedy is the story of our lives, and<br />\nsometimes the line between comedy and tragedy cannot<br />\nbe drawn too distinctly. The hit series could be based<br />\non the real-life story of a university radio station called<br />\nWJHU. This is their story seen through my eyes. If I<br />\nfail to portray it accurately, what can I say except it's<br />\nmy version of the truth?<br />\n<br />\n\"Life'. but a<br />\n\u2022 walking shadow.'<br />\nThe Dorms are pretty grim at 6 in the morning,<br />\nespecially if I go to sleep at 2 A.M.

What was the<br />\nprice of gold in Tokyo? Where is the ruler with which I<br />\ncut copy?<br />\nThe search for the rulers takes up a good portion of<br />\ntime at the newsroom. Rulers have a way of shuffling off<br />\nto other dimensions, or at least to other studios. Life is a<br />\nconstant battle against migrating pens, pencils, staplers,<br />\nand other essential items.<br />\nKeys are another source of much controversy in the<br />\npeculiar social order of the station.

The youths apparently escaped unscathed. Police say that the car, identified as<br />\nbelonging to the Brooks Brothers, Shields and Robinson,<br />\nhas been linked with several such incidents in the past<br />\nfew weeks. The Brooks Brothers, self-described \"hopelessly adolescent journalists,\" are currently being sought<br />\nby police, insurance adjusters and Writing Seminars<br />\nTA.'s from the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\n<br />\nBreakfast consists of a cup of coffee, which is hotter<br />\nthan the shower.<br />\nThe janitorial staff is just coming in when I get up;<br />\nthey and I stand on common ground when we both have<br />\nto get up so early in the morning.

Perhaps that is why newspeople are the most<br />\n_callous and cynical of all.<br />\nThe paper supply is low and both it and the ribbon<br />\nneeds changing; these are curious rituals that require a<br />\nstrong vocabulary and a willingness to get one's hands<br />\ndirty. The damn ink never seems to come off, and by<br />\nthe time it does, another ribbon has to be changed.<br />\nThe copy is cut into neat sections and filed in<br />\nproper folders, which, as the day progresses, get messed<br />\nup beyond belief or repair. The newsroom itself follows<br />\nthis acient principle of entropy, for no matter how neat<br />\nit starts out, by the end of the day it is a mess. Anyway,<br />\n<br />\nWorking with radio equipment can be very satisfying when you do things right. It can be disastrous the<br />\nrest of the time. To make sure you screw up the maximum number of times possible, monitors, recording<br />\nequipment, level indicators, microphones, etc., cease to<br />\nfunction at precisely the time when you need them the<br />\nmost.

That means four hours.<br />\nThere are meetings to be attended, which often run over<br />\nan hours. I spend two hours planning a four-hour<br />\nclassical show, once a week. I spend one or two evenings<br />\nattending lectures which are taped, and several hours in<br />\nproduction time. Out of a 24-hour day, I could easily<br />\nspend 25% with matters concerning WJHU. That may<br />\nnot seem like much, but I also have a full work load.<br />\nThere are lesser concerns such as sleeping and eating.<br />\nThe strange part of this whole thing is that my case is<br />\nnot unusual. There are members of the station much<br />\nmore involved that I who spend a majority of their time<br />\nat WJHU. It's much like an iceberg; 90% of the work<br />\ncannot be seen. The sweat that goes into it is truly<br />\nincredible, and because people are not aware and don't<br />\nbother to listen, WJHU is truly the perfect situation<br />\ncomedy. Or is it a tragedy?<br />\n<br />\n\"...It is a tale,<br />\ntold by an idiot...\"<br />\n\"Hey look, we got mentioned in the Newsletter.\"<br />\nyes, I saw that!

It is a catch-all used as a<br />\nsafety-valve to release the frustrations of a group ot<br />\npeople who are working hard and see no tangible returns. This safety-valve works only when people realize<br />\nwhat FM really means; for a very long time, they have<br />\nasked: \"Is it worth it? Is all this effort really worth it?\"<br />\nAfter all, why shouldn't they ask this? WJHU is the<br />\nbutt of many jokes:<br />\nQ: \"Hey, did you hear the one about WJHU?\"<br />\nA: \"RI?\"<br />\nI can't begin to tell you how annoying it is to hear:\"I<br />\ndidn't even know we had a radio station,\" or\"Gee, I<br />\ncan hardly pick it up... better put another gerbel in the<br />\nengine, heh-heh.\"<br />\nIt's gotten to the point where people on the station<br />\nare beginning to doubt their own sanity. Why should a<br />\nperson spend hours on a program (or at a meeting, or in<br />\na production session) when no one is listening?<br />\nMy reply is this: Why should an actor spend hours<br />\nin a dress rehearsal reading lines to an empty theatre?<br />\nShould an actor wait until opening night to start learning<br />\nthe lines? That would be crazy. Likewise, it would be<br />\ninsane for us not to spend time on the radio when no<br />\none is listening.

For starters, we are not paid<br />\nfor our efforts. We aren't given credits by the University. (In fact, there isn't even a mass media and communications department for pre-unemployment students<br />\nlike me.) So if there is any motivation to work for<br />\nWJHU, it is an internal one. A major problem is the<br />\nsimple fact that WJHU, being student-run, has a high<br />\nturnover rate. People come, and especially as their work<br />\nloads increase, they go. The few hardy souls left are<br />\nburdened with the responsibility of providing knowledge<br />\nfor the new arrivals.<br />\nStation personnel, being human beings, do have<br />\nconflicts among themselves.

So will FM.<br />\nGeneral Staff Meetings are loose forums on the ideas<br />\nthat have been generated by members of the station.<br />\nThese confabs also provide the opportunity for people<br />\nto complain about whatever they feel is worth complaining about. For the most part the meetings are silly,<br />\nbecause they are attended by two types of people:<br />\nthose who care, and those who don't. The former group<br />\nis highly motivated and can often get things discussed<br />\nand done without the GSM. The latter want to get back<br />\nto the library as quickly as possible. And then there are<br />\nthose who never leave the library in the first place.<br />\nWJHU has also developed its own bureaucracy,<br />\nwhich, in the grand tradition of most bureaucracies, is<br />\nrather inefficient. This, I suspect, is so because of<br />\nthe large number of people actually involved with the<br />\nstation.<br />\n\"I'd like to get a tape done.\"<br />\n\"Oh you would, would you?

Such an instrumental<br />\ncombination is rather unusual for jazz,<br />\nbut it can yield beautiful results, as<br />\nevidenced by this performance.<br />\nThree collective improvisations, a<br />\nsolo clarinet piece, and a final improvisational duet for cello and bass were<br />\npresented, with no commentary or titles<br />\ngiven beforehand. The three musicians<br />\nwere consistently creative and they<br />\nprojected an energy and enthusiasm that<br />\nmade the music especially communicative. In any free music, some of the<br />\nrepeated ideas partly stem from the<br />\nlearned playing techniques associated<br />\nwith each instrument. Honsinger, Robinson, and Onserud have all had classical<br />\ntraining and experience, and this figures<br />\nprominently in their sound, from Robinson's turns to Honsinger's rich vibrato<br />\nand glissandos.<br />\nOnserud's exposure<br />\nto Cecil Taylor's \"unit structures\"(which<br />\nare highly lyrical but virtually devoid<br />\nof chord changes) and Robinson's eclectic<br />\njazz background have also influenced the<br />\ntrio's overall sound.<br />\nThe musicians exploited the unique<br />\ntonal qualities of their instruments<br />\nto produce a wide range of effects.<br />\nHonsinger and Onserud played below the<br />\n<br />\nIIlbw:\u2014<br />\n<br />\nTristan Honsinger<br />\n<br />\nbridge, rubbed the strings and surface of<br />\ntheir instruments with hands, allowed the<br />\nbow to bounce on the strings, and simultaneously bowed and plucked the strings.<br />\nHonsinger's improvisations were mainly<br />\nvertical combinations based on a scale, in<br />\nmany ways analogous to Coltrane's modal<br />\ntechniques. He was able to emphasize<br />\ncertain pitches .over others and impose<br />\nharmonic structures, primarily ostinatos<br />\nor drones, on this field, sometimes<br />\nmoving out of key into atonality. By<br />\nabandoning conventional bass positions<br />\nand freely using his bass as a percussive<br />\ninstrument, Onserud could participate<br />\nmuch more directly in the music rather<br />\nthan functioning as an \"accompaniment.\"<br />\nHis playing provided a melodic and<br />\ndissonant counterpoint, not merely a<br />\nmeans of keeping time for the group.<br />\nRobinson's playing was the most controlled and premeditated, but was equally<br />\ninventive. Split tones, harmonics, and<br />\ntense upper-register cries were combined<br />\nwith smooth jazz riffs. His more traditional phrasing was effectively contrasted<br />\nwith accents of bass and cello.<br />\nThe trio generally employed a<br />\ntheme-and-variation format. The theme<br />\nwould fade in and out, passed from<br />\ninstrument to instrument (and transformed in the process), or would be<br />\nmaintained by one player (usually clarinet), while the other two improvised<br />\naround it. Within this format one could<br />\ndetect a layering of sound from each<br />\ninstrument, each layer following somewhat different organizational principles.<br />\nThe resulting confluences and chance<br />\nencounters between layers were fascinating. One got an impression of disintegration and reformation, divergence and<br />\nconvergence as the musical lines went off<br />\non frenzied tangents then fell back into<br />\nthe layered pattern.<br />\nThe musicians<br />\ncontinually brought the music to the<br />\nverge of chaos, then restored unity<br />\nquickly or in slow and subtle stages. The<br />\ninternal rhythm of the music was plastic<br />\nand could readily change its shape.<br />\nThe first and longest piece introduced the audience to several common<br />\naspects of the trio's performance. It<br />\nbegan with a melodic Philip Glass-like<br />\nstructure (unison and ostinato variations)<br />\n<br />\nwhich acted as a base to which the music<br />\nwould return when it \"converged.\"<br />\nHonsinger accompanied himself with a<br />\nvague scat vocal, including whistling,<br />\ngrowling, clicking, grunting, howling, etc.<br />\nOnserud joined him in making these<br />\nsounds. The effect was often deliberately<br />\ncomic but added to the interplay of<br />\nsimilar instrumental sounds. Onserud<br />\nachieved interesting spatial effects by<br />\nrotating his bass as he bowed it. Both<br />\nplayers' facial expressions and movements<br />\nadded a humorous visual element to the<br />\nperformance. At one point, Honsinger<br />\nbrought some hangers from a coatrack<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 11<br />\nand \"played\" these along with the bass<br />\nand clarinet. This led to a mini-drama in<br />\nwhich Honsinger went behind the stage<br />\nand had to be coaxed out by Robinson,<br />\nwho walked about playing, while Onserud<br />\ndanced around his bass, then played it in<br />\na horizontal position on the floor. After<br />\na vocal-clarinet dialogue between Honsinger and Robinson, the trio reassembled<br />\nand and brought the piece to a conclusion, Robinson playing flowing melodies<br />\non individual sections of the clarinet<br />\n(which he had taken apart). This clever<br />\nuse of theater creates a new basis for<br />\ncommunication with the audience and is<br />\nan extension of the impromptu, intuitive,<br />\nexstatic qualities that distinguish jazz<br />\nfrom other comtemporary musics. When<br />\nthey desired, the trio could change the<br />\nproceedings into a musical theater of the<br />\nabsurd, full of emotion, possessing its<br />\nown meaningless language of phonetic<br />\nnoises.<br />\nThe second piece featured a pizzicato<br />\nduet by the cello and bass and remarkable<br />\noscillating tones from the clarinet. A<br />\nsubdued section of deep bass gave way to<br />\na fairly conventional eighth-note line<br />\nbefore plunging into a series of short,<br />\nstabbing phrases, swirling triplets, and<br />\ninterplay among the instruments. Theatrics included Honsinger dancing with an<br />\ninvisible partner while Robinson played a<br />\nwaltzy tune, and Honsinger telling an<br />\nabsurdist fable over a sorrowful string<br />\ndirge. The piece became choppy and<br />\ndisconnected, then re-formed into what<br />\nmight be called jazz hoedown.<br />\nThe clarinet solo consisted of variations on an A-G-F-C riff, with rapid<br />\nswitching from high to low register; later,<br />\nthe fourth piece was built around a<br />\nsimilar clarinet pattern. This penultimate<br />\npiece had a chant-like quality: grinding<br />\nstrings and many short repetitive phrases.<br />\nThe players would often suspend lines<br />\nand leave them airborne without making<br />\ncustomary resolutions.<br />\nOutstanding<br />\nspatial effects were achieved when<br />\nOnserud slowly moved around the outer<br />\nperimeter of the performing area. The<br />\nfinal piece was a showcase for Honsinger,<br />\nwho walked around while playing,<br />\nlooking like Ian Anderson with a cello. It<br />\ncontained some excellent dialogues between bass and cello, and a long \"scat<br />\ndialogue\" between Onserud and Honsinger.<br />\nThe trio's performance was engrossing and, moreover, enjoyable listening.<br />\nIt was a good example of modern jazz at<br />\nits best--a synthesis of serious and popular<br />\nforms created by musicians with improvisatory freedom and artistic virtuosity.<br />\n--Mark Skoner<br />\n<br />\nGrateful Dead Movie Is<br />\n441*-4/Mri-aim4ro A Live Experience<br />\nEnrique Graf<br />\nBound For Glory<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n'What makes a great pianist?' and time before this talent will be universally<br />\n'What makes a pianist great?' are two recognized.

The 9:30<br />\nshuttle never arrived. When<br />\nthe 10:00 shuttle arrived, a<br />\ncrowd of 60 would-be riders had<br />\ngathered to crowd onto the bus.<br />\nThe problem increased when<br />\nthose who had just arrived<br />\npushed their way on ahead of<br />\nsome people who had been<br />\nwaiting for up to an hour in the<br />\ncold.<br />\nThe driver, Bill Dorrell,<br />\nrefused to leave with riders<br />\nstanding in the aisle and on the<br />\nsteps, but no passengers would<br />\nget off. Finally he, radioed the<br />\nMagsamen Bus Co. for instruc-<br /><br />\ntions, and they called Hopkins<br />\nSecuirty. Four officers, including Security Manager Robert<br />\nLarkin, responded to the call.<br />\nMark Warren, a medical<br />\nstudent, says that the Security<br />\nofficers flew into a rage. He says<br />\nthey were \"screaming as loud as<br />\nthey could, 'get off the bus or<br />\nwe'll throw you off.\" Warren<br />\nadmits that the riders' response<br />\nwas,\"if they didn't get down (to<br />\nEast Baltimore) why should<br />\nanyone get down\" and that<br />\nthere was \"verbal abuse back<br />\nand forth.\" He thinks \"there<br />\nshould have been an attempt to<br />\nreach an equitable solution, \"<br />\nsuch as asking those who had<br />\njust arrived to wait, or putting<br />\nthe University van into service.<br />\nDr. Paul McHugh, Director<br /><br />\nAthletic Center<br />\nStiffens Security<br /><br />\nWJHU To Be FM<br /><br />\nSkinner<br />\nSpeaks<br /><br />\nJanitor Hours Proposed<br /><br />\nConduct Code<br />\nRedrafted<br /><br />\nPAGE 4 I FEBRUARY 23, 1979<br /><br />\n1The Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews Letter<br />\nThe News-Letter is published weekly during the school<br />\nyear by the students of the Johns Hopkins University.

Ono<br /><br />\nReefer Reform 'letters to the editorl<br />\nIt is a strange paradox that the increased use of the<br />\ndrug cannabis among \"respectable\" middle-class citizens<br />\nseems if anything to have led to a more complacent<br />\nattitude toward the law forbidding the possession of<br />\nmarijuana. But in the words of national NORML director<br />\nLarry Schott, \"Pot has become so commonplace, it's not a<br />\ncultural symbol any more.\"<br />\nYet the outlawed status of marijuana remains one of<br />\nthe biggest single travesties perpetrated by the government<br />\non our society today. The official hypocrisy engendered<br />\nby the current situation rivals the disastrous spectacle of<br />\nProhibition. The frequent and flagrant flouting of the<br />\nmarijuana law not only weakens the moral force of that<br />\nparticular statute, it also subverts respect for the role of<br />\nlaw in an entire generation of citizens. Such a trend<br />\ncannot be tolerated; no society can be strong unless the<br />\nlaws it establishes are enforced and observed to the fullest<br />\nextent by its good members.<br />\nIn spite of the widespread disregard for the penalties<br />\nconcerning cannabis consumption, the law takes a heavy<br />\ntoll. Over 470,000 people were arrested in this country last<br />\nyear on such charges, an all-time high. Of these cases, 90%<br />\nwere for simple possession. The continued illegitimacy of<br />\nmarijuana makes respectable citizenship quite tenuous for<br />\nanyone who uses the drug.<br />\nThere are no solid reasons why growing, owning, and<br />\nsmoking pot should remain illegal. The short-term effects<br />\nof the drug are in many respects comparable to those of<br />\nalcohol, which is allowed. However, it is much less disruptive of physical coordination, and there is no unpleasant<br />\nafter-effect\u2014read hangover. Neither have harmful long-term<br />\neffects been proven for moderate marijuana users. Used to<br />\nexcess, like alcohol, cigarettes, or even food, it can wreck a<br />\nlife.<br />\nIn any case, since marijuana affects only people who<br />\nchoose to use it, our government has no sacred right to<br />\nforbid the substance. Of course, in one important situation<br />\na person's decision to get high could affect others, that is,<br />\nwhen that person is planning to drive an automobile. A<br />\nsimple test has fortunately been devised to detect .drivers<br />\nunder the influence of marijuana. Such \"high driving\"<br />\nshould be subject to severe penalties just like drunk driving<br />\nnow is.<br />\nThe so-callocd \"decriminalization\" of marijuana which<br />\nhas been introduced into some jurisdictions is but a<br />\ncompromising solution at best. Traffic-sized fines for<br />\nmarijuana violations arc even more hypocritical then the<br />\npresent system, if that is possible. Only with total legalizadon of the distribution and possession of cannabis products can our society return to a sane. rational course.<br /><br />\nBlizzard Bedlam<br />\n'I'LL BE PUTTIN'IN A LOT OF OVERTIME IN NOVEMBER.'<br /><br />\nDrivel<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt is with humble sincerity<br />\nthat I submit this apology to<br />\nanyone who might have misconstrued the intent of my<br />\nprevious letter (Hicks, January<br />\n26 issue). I am from a small<br />\ntown in West Virginia where one<br />\ncould not spit down Main street<br />\non breezy day without hitting<br />\none of my relatives. Needless to<br />\nsay, any \"degrading\" remarks<br />\npertaining to Mountain people<br />\nwere strictly unintentional.<br />\nI was taken aback, however,<br />\nat the suppressive tone of \"Slur<br />\nStir\" (February 9 issue). It is<br />\nmy understanding that the first<br />\namendment to the Constitution<br />\n(an excellent document, and I<br />\nrecommend that those responsible for \"Slur Stir\" subject it to<br />\nperusal some evening when not<br />\nout crusading) guarantees that<br />\nfreedom of the press shall not be<br />\nabridged. I expect that the<br />\ncomposers of this illiberal epistle<br />\nadvocate censorship of the<br />\nNews-Letter (themselves to be<br />\nthe censors, no doubt).<br />\n\"Slur Stir\" might be passed<br />\noff as well intentioned drivel if it<br />\ndid not contain implicit advocation of suppression of the free<br />\npress. The News-Letter is to be<br />\ncommended for its willingness to<br />\nprint even so reactionary an<br />\nopinion.<br />\nGeorge Stanton<br /><br />\nWay Out<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nYou know, if some things<br />\nweren't worth taking a stand for,<br />\nit wouldn't make a bit of difference what the administration<br />\ndid to the Hopkins custodial<br />\nschedule...or what happened to<br />\nRic Pfeffer...or how many<br />\npeople were exterminated under<br />\nMao Tse-Tung's regime...or how<br />\na nation once begged to have a<br />\nmurderer released to them that<br />\nthey might crucify an innocent<br />\nman.<br />\nAnd when there isn't a<br />\nsufficient portion of the population willing to take a stand<br />\nagainst such injustices, they go<br />\non and on, leaving succeeding<br />\ngenerations to clean up the mess.<br />\nYet the guilt falls not solely into<br />\nthe 'hands of those who perpetrate deceit, but also into the<br />\nhands of those who. stand idly<br />\nby. supposing that they are not<br />\naffected, nor responsible for<br />\ntheir own destiny.<br />\nAs for myself, it would be<br />\nbut a simple thing to shrug my<br />\nshoulders, finish writing my<br />\nthesis, and disappear into the<br />\nsunset, never again having to<br /><br />\nconcern myself with Hopkins or<br />\nthe Twig fellowship I've coordinated here for the past few<br />\nyears...And then it wouldn't<br />\nmake a bit of difference what<br />\nDaisy Taylor wrote in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter about The<br />\nWay.<br />\nBut that's not the course I<br />\nchoose to follow. It's not that<br />\nI'm so eminently noble, or<br />\nexceedingly virtuous, or endowed with wisdom that will<br />\nperish with my demise. Nor is it<br />\nthat I follow The Way with<br />\n\"blind devotion\", and have sold<br />\nmy soul to but a vain endeavor,<br />\nrelishing in continual deceit of<br />\nmy colleagues and peers, for I<br />\nam none of the above.<br />\nYet I have taken a stand,<br />\nand will not begin to presume<br />\nthat I have not the responsibility<br />\nto stLe what I know is true. I<br />\ntrust that those who were<br />\ninterested enough to read Ms.<br />\nTaylor's article will give at least<br />\nequal consideration to this point<br />\nof view.<br />\nThis is not a complaint, nor<br />\nan attempt to set the record<br />\nstraight. The article stands on<br />\nits own merits, or falls by its<br />\nlack thereof.<br />\nIn the same<br />\nrespect, if what we of The Way<br />\nbelieve and teach is truth, it will<br />\nbear witness of itself.<br />\nAnd so, we could close the<br />\nbooks on the article right here,<br />\nallowing those who revere NewsLetter authority to believe every<br />\nlast line with \"unquestioned<br />\ndevotion\", and leaving everyone<br />\nelse to come and see for themselves what The Way is really all<br />\nabout if they're genuinely interested, or to stay at home if they<br />\naren't.<br />\nBut as we lay to rest an<br />\narticle that is either a brilliant<br />\nexpose or one of the most<br />\nludicrous pieces of yellow journalism ever published, permit me<br />\nto voice for ponderance a few<br />\nquestions I find difficult to<br />\nreconcile ill my mind.<br />\nThe first of these surely has<br />\nmore than myself perplexed,<br />\nthat is, why the News-Letter<br />\nwould go to such lengths and<br />\nspend so much time taking a<br />\ncrack at a student organization<br />\nwhich it obviously feels is having<br />\nlittle or no impact on campus<br />\nanyway. Judging from the contents of last week's issue, I<br />\ndaresay you have more profitable ways to spend your time,<br />\nlike covering items of wider<br />\nstudent interest, describing<br />\nporno flicks, and publishing such<br />\nthings as guides to sleazy living<br />\nreplete with the most edifying of<br />\nphotographs.<br />\nAnd just for the record, you<br />\nmight want to clarify which<br />\nstudents say \"No Way to The<br />\nWay.\" Were they an accurate<br />\nrepresentation of the hundreds<br />\nof members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity who have attended<br /><br />\nTwig fellowships over the past<br />\nseveral years and those who have<br />\ntaken the Power For Abundant<br />\nLiving class?<br />\nOr were you<br />\nreferring to the handful or so<br />\nMs. Taylor dug out of those<br />\ndiscontent to interview?<br />\nAnd merely because I consider it humorous, perhaps you<br />\ncould explain why someone<br />\nwho described herself as an<br />\navowed atheist would put in<br />\nsuch a nice plug for the Hopkins<br />\nChristian Fellowship at the end<br />\nof her article. If I were in with<br />\nthe IV boys, I'd look askance at<br />\nsuch a promotion...it's almost<br />\nlike Hitler recommending the<br />\nlocal synagogue for spiritual<br />\nenlightenment.<br />\nWhile you reflect on these<br />\npoints of query, there's a possibility you might also like to<br />\nconsider this--The Way is a<br />\nfellowship of the followers of<br />\nthe Lord Jesus Christ for the<br />\nmanifestation of the more abundant life. And we never said<br />\nthat means having piles .of<br />\nmoney. What it does mean is<br />\nanswers, it means keys and<br />\nprinciples that anyone can know<br />\nand operate, it means living life<br />\nthe way it was designed to be<br />\nlived. And for that kind of<br />\nknowledge you've got to go to<br />\nthe source, God and His Word.<br />\nWe've never said that we<br />\nhave ALL the answers, or that<br />\nwe've cornered the market on<br />\ntruth. What we have said is that<br />\nwe endeavor to rightly divide the<br />\nWord of God so that we can find<br />\nanswers. Hey, aren't you tired<br />\nof guessing?<br />\nThere's a lot more to be<br />\nsaid, and we are going to continue saying it. Those that have<br />\nears to hear, let THEM hear, and<br />\nfor those that don't, they can let<br />\ntheir kids figure it out.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nSue Matesic<br />\nThe Way Campus Outreach<br /><br />\nThanks<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nI would just like to thank<br />\nMiss Resnick for the insights she<br />\nprovided in her brilliant piece of<br />\ncommentary concerning the<br />\nNews-Letter editorial on national health insurance.<br />\nThe points she makes about<br />\nthe distance doctors travel to see<br />\ntheir patients and the length of<br />\ntime they are forced to spend in<br />\ntheir treatment go a long way<br />\ntoward proving the wisdom of<br />\nan old saw: History majors<br />\nknow nothing about economics.<br />\nThe public might also take<br />\nsome enlightenment from the<br />\nfact that Miss Resnick's father<br />\nhappens to be a prominent<br />\nPhiladelphia cardiologist.<br />\nRoscoe Richards '79<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER 1 PAGE 5<br /><br />\n10% OFF<br /><br />\n10% OFF<br /><br />\n10% OFF<br /><br />\nINTERMITIOTIAL rELLOWS LECTURE SERIES<br /><br />\nnustrrrs<br /><br />\nALL JOHNS HOPIUNS UNIVERSITY PRESS<br />\nPAPERBACKS IN STOCK<br />\nAT THE JHU BOOKCENTER<br /><br />\nFINLAND: Between<br />\nEast and West<br />\nrulTurtinci<br />\nMs. Aila Laitinen<br />\nTampere University, Finland<br /><br />\nWednesday, February 28th at 7 P.M.<br />\nin the Board Room of Shriver Hall<br /><br />\nSale extended 2 weeks....<br /><br />\nWine and cheese will be served<br /><br />\nNOW THRU MONDAY, MARCH 19<br /><br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n4<br /><br />\nJ.H.U.

This safety-valve works only when people realize<br />\nwhat FM really means; for a very long time, they have<br />\nasked: \"Is it worth it?

(In fact, there isn't even a mass media and communications department for pre-unemployment students<br />\nlike me.) So if there is any motivation to work for<br />\nWJHU, it is an internal one. A major problem is the<br />\nsimple fact that WJHU, being student-run, has a high<br />\nturnover rate. People come, and especially as their work<br />\nloads increase, they go. The few hardy souls left are<br />\nburdened with the responsibility of providing knowledge<br />\nfor the new arrivals.<br />\nStation personnel, being human beings, do have<br />\nconflicts among themselves.

So will FM.<br />\nGeneral Staff Meetings are loose forums on the ideas<br />\nthat have been generated by members of the station.<br />\nThese confabs also provide the opportunity for people<br />\nto complain about whatever they feel is worth complaining about. For the most part the meetings are silly,<br />\nbecause they are attended by two types of people:<br />\nthose who care, and those who don't. The former group<br />\nis highly motivated and can often get things discussed<br />\nand done without the GSM. The latter want to get back<br />\nto the library as quickly as possible. And then there are<br />\nthose who never leave the library in the first place.<br />\nWJHU has also developed its own bureaucracy,<br />\nwhich, in the grand tradition of most bureaucracies, is<br />\nrather inefficient. This, I suspect, is so because of<br />\nthe large number of people actually involved with the<br />\nstation.<br />\n\"I'd like to get a tape done.\"<br />\n\"Oh you would, would you?

The three musicians<br />\nwere consistently creative and they<br />\nprojected an energy and enthusiasm that<br />\nmade the music especially communicative. In any free music, some of the<br />\nrepeated ideas partly stem from the<br />\nlearned playing techniques associated<br />\nwith each instrument. Honsinger, Robinson, and Onserud have all had classical<br />\ntraining and experience, and this figures<br />\nprominently in their sound, from Robinson's turns to Honsinger's rich vibrato<br />\nand glissandos.<br />\nOnserud's exposure<br />\nto Cecil Taylor's \"unit structures\"(which<br />\nare highly lyrical but virtually devoid<br />\nof chord changes) and Robinson's eclectic<br />\njazz background have also influenced the<br />\ntrio's overall sound.<br />\nThe musicians exploited the unique<br />\ntonal qualities of their instruments<br />\nto produce a wide range of effects.<br />\nHonsinger and Onserud played below the<br /><br />\nIIlbw:\u2014<br /><br />\nTristan Honsinger<br /><br />\nbridge, rubbed the strings and surface of<br />\ntheir instruments with hands, allowed the<br />\nbow to bounce on the strings, and simultaneously bowed and plucked the strings.<br />\nHonsinger's improvisations were mainly<br />\nvertical combinations based on a scale, in<br />\nmany ways analogous to Coltrane's modal<br />\ntechniques. He was able to emphasize<br />\ncertain pitches .over others and impose<br />\nharmonic structures, primarily ostinatos<br />\nor drones, on this field, sometimes<br />\nmoving out of key into atonality. By<br />\nabandoning conventional bass positions<br />\nand freely using his bass as a percussive<br />\ninstrument, Onserud could participate<br />\nmuch more directly in the music rather<br />\nthan functioning as an \"accompaniment.\"<br />\nHis playing provided a melodic and<br />\ndissonant counterpoint, not merely a<br />\nmeans of keeping time for the group.<br />\nRobinson's playing was the most controlled and premeditated, but was equally<br />\ninventive. Split tones, harmonics, and<br />\ntense upper-register cries were combined<br />\nwith smooth jazz riffs. His more traditional phrasing was effectively contrasted<br />\nwith accents of bass and cello.<br />\nThe trio generally employed a<br />\ntheme-and-variation format. The theme<br />\nwould fade in and out, passed from<br />\ninstrument to instrument (and transformed in the process), or would be<br />\nmaintained by one player (usually clarinet), while the other two improvised<br />\naround it. Within this format one could<br />\ndetect a layering of sound from each<br />\ninstrument, each layer following somewhat different organizational principles.<br />\nThe resulting confluences and chance<br />\nencounters between layers were fascinating. One got an impression of disintegration and reformation, divergence and<br />\nconvergence as the musical lines went off<br />\non frenzied tangents then fell back into<br />\nthe layered pattern.<br />\nThe musicians<br />\ncontinually brought the music to the<br />\nverge of chaos, then restored unity<br />\nquickly or in slow and subtle stages. The<br />\ninternal rhythm of the music was plastic<br />\nand could readily change its shape.<br />\nThe first and longest piece introduced the audience to several common<br />\naspects of the trio's performance. It<br />\nbegan with a melodic Philip Glass-like<br />\nstructure (unison and ostinato variations)<br /><br />\nwhich acted as a base to which the music<br />\nwould return when it \"converged.\"<br />\nHonsinger accompanied himself with a<br />\nvague scat vocal, including whistling,<br />\ngrowling, clicking, grunting, howling, etc.<br />\nOnserud joined him in making these<br />\nsounds. The effect was often deliberately<br />\ncomic but added to the interplay of<br />\nsimilar instrumental sounds. Onserud<br />\nachieved interesting spatial effects by<br />\nrotating his bass as he bowed it. Both<br />\nplayers' facial expressions and movements<br />\nadded a humorous visual element to the<br />\nperformance. At one point, Honsinger<br />\nbrought some hangers from a coatrack<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 11<br />\nand \"played\" these along with the bass<br />\nand clarinet. This led to a mini-drama in<br />\nwhich Honsinger went behind the stage<br />\nand had to be coaxed out by Robinson,<br />\nwho walked about playing, while Onserud<br />\ndanced around his bass, then played it in<br />\na horizontal position on the floor. After<br />\na vocal-clarinet dialogue between Honsinger and Robinson, the trio reassembled<br />\nand and brought the piece to a conclusion, Robinson playing flowing melodies<br />\non individual sections of the clarinet<br />\n(which he had taken apart). This clever<br />\nuse of theater creates a new basis for<br />\ncommunication with the audience and is<br />\nan extension of the impromptu, intuitive,<br />\nexstatic qualities that distinguish jazz<br />\nfrom other comtemporary musics. When<br />\nthey desired, the trio could change the<br />\nproceedings into a musical theater of the<br />\nabsurd, full of emotion, possessing its<br />\nown meaningless language of phonetic<br />\nnoises.<br />\nThe second piece featured a pizzicato<br />\nduet by the cello and bass and remarkable<br />\noscillating tones from the clarinet. A<br />\nsubdued section of deep bass gave way to<br />\na fairly conventional eighth-note line<br />\nbefore plunging into a series of short,<br />\nstabbing phrases, swirling triplets, and<br />\ninterplay among the instruments. Theatrics included Honsinger dancing with an<br />\ninvisible partner while Robinson played a<br />\nwaltzy tune, and Honsinger telling an<br />\nabsurdist fable over a sorrowful string<br />\ndirge. The piece became choppy and<br />\ndisconnected, then re-formed into what<br />\nmight be called jazz hoedown.<br />\nThe clarinet solo consisted of variations on an A-G-F-C riff, with rapid<br />\nswitching from high to low register; later,<br />\nthe fourth piece was built around a<br />\nsimilar clarinet pattern. This penultimate<br />\npiece had a chant-like quality: grinding<br />\nstrings and many short repetitive phrases.<br />\nThe players would often suspend lines<br />\nand leave them airborne without making<br />\ncustomary resolutions.<br />\nOutstanding<br />\nspatial effects were achieved when<br />\nOnserud slowly moved around the outer<br />\nperimeter of the performing area. The<br />\nfinal piece was a showcase for Honsinger,<br />\nwho walked around while playing,<br />\nlooking like Ian Anderson with a cello. It<br />\ncontained some excellent dialogues between bass and cello, and a long \"scat<br />\ndialogue\" between Onserud and Honsinger.<br />\nThe trio's performance was engrossing and, moreover, enjoyable listening.<br />\nIt was a good example of modern jazz at<br />\nits best--a synthesis of serious and popular<br />\nforms created by musicians with improvisatory freedom and artistic virtuosity.<br />\n--Mark Skoner<br /><br />\nGrateful Dead Movie Is<br />\n441*-4/Mri-aim4ro A Live Experience<br />\nEnrique Graf<br />\nBound For Glory<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n'What makes a great pianist?' and time before this talent will be universally<br />\n'What makes a pianist great?' are two recognized.
