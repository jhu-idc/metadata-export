The latest proposal has the board composed of three students<br />\nthree faculty . members and one administrator.<br />\nThe Committee's report had requested two<br />\ngraduate students, two undergraduate students,<br />\ntwo faculty members and one administrator.<br />\nGordon stated that this change, which maidtains the ratio on the review board proposed by<br />\nan ad hoc discipline Committee last summer,<br />\nwould prevent any segment of the community .<br />\nfrom having a majority of members. He believed<br />\na majority of any interest group would be<br />\nundesirable.<br />\nIn addition, Gordon retained expulsion as a<br />\npunishment. The SAC had eliminated that and,<br />\ninstead, suggested the possibility of \"indefinite<br />\nsuspension,\" with a yearly appeal. Gordon felt<br />\nthat this would set up two separate admissions<br />\nprocedures. He also suggested that the yearly appeal might turn into a \"sideshow.\"<br />\nGordon also added the phrase \"conduct that<br />\n<br />\nimpairs the effective functioning of the University...\" to the definition of behavior subject to<br />\nsanctions. He did not feel that sanctioning only<br />\n,behavior that infringed upon the rights of other<br />\npeople or groups would be sufficient.<br />\nFurther changes were made in the selection<br />\nprocedures and rules for open meetings of the<br />\nReview Board. Gordon gave the Board the power<br />\nto close its meetings, as he claimed open meetings \"might invite disruptive tactics.\"<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee was not informed by Gordon of his new proposal. This was<br />\ncalled by SAC Chairman John White of Art History as \"rude.\" Richard Conviser, a member of<br />\nSAC, stated that the president had \"violated\"<br />\nthe trust of the committee. He claimed that<br />\nhe would approve the SAC's proposal and, because of this, \"we went to the right of our first<br />\ndraft.\" He called Gordon's new statemenf \"A<br />\nbackwards way of doing things.\"<br />\nDr. Steve Mann of the Education department,<br />\na member of the Student Affairs Committee,<br />\nstated, \"He is wrong and we are right,\" when<br />\nasked his opinion of Gordon's report. SAC will<br />\nofficially respond to the new proposal next<br />\nweek.<br />\nBob Cotter, president of the Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization and also a member of the Committee, commented that they were \"sucked into this<br />\non good faith of having some sort of compromise,\" and since Gordon had violated \"that sort<br />\nof agreement, we should throw out the whole<br />\nthing.\" He accused Gordon of being \"paranoid.\"<br />\nGordon sent copies .of his revision of the ad<br />\nhoc Committee's report to the administrative<br />\nheads of the University's four divisions, asking<br />\n<br />\nthat they discuss it with whomever they deemed<br />\nnecessary. All divisions except Homewood sent<br />\nback the report unchanged last fall.<br />\nIn the Arts and Sciences division, Dean Kimball referred it to SAC, who considered the report last semester and sent back their recommendations at the beginning of January. It was<br />\nfrom these reports and conversations with faculty members that Gordon reached his final<br />\ndecision. Gordon stated that a covering letter<br />\non the SAC report from Dean Kimball expressed<br />\nconcern at the number of changes SAC had<br />\nmade. Gordon said that he also took these comments into consideration.<br />\n<br />\nGordon Advocates State Agency<br />\nFor Hospital and College Growth<br />\nTestifying before the State Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, Lincoln Gordon advocated<br />\nformation of a statewide borrowing authority to aid Maryland's<br />\nprivate. universities and hospitals<br />\nin financing construction.<br />\nIdentical bills providing for the<br />\nformation of a Maryland Health<br />\nand Higher Educational Facilities<br />\nAuthority are now in committees<br />\nof the Senate and General Assembly. The bills were pre-filed early in<br />\nNovember by Governor Mandel's<br />\noffice. Besides gubernatorial support, there appears to be a solid<br />\nmajority in both houses which<br />\nfavors the bill.<br />\nThe idea was first proposed to<br />\nGovernor Mandel by Lincoln Gordon and the bills were originally<br />\ndrafted by the Hopkins legal staff.<br />\nThe model for the borrowing<br />\nagency was derived from similar<br />\nagencies now in operation in nine<br />\nstates.<br />\nThe Authority, if constituted in<br />\nits present form, would substantially reduce the borrowing costs of<br />\nprivate institutions throughout the<br />\n\u2022-<br />\n<br />\nstate. It would be empowered to<br />\nissue revenue bonds against the<br />\ncollective credit of all of the<br />\nstate's private medical and educational institutions, thus substantially reducing the interest required<br />\nfor financing.<br />\nRevenue bonds issued against<br />\nthe credit of the proposed agency<br />\nmight carry an interest rate of 6.5%<br />\nto 7.5%. Private health and educational institutions which can now<br />\narrange financing through commercial loans are paying up to 11.5%.<br />\nIn addition to the added security<br />\nwhich stems from the collective<br />\ncredit of all private institutions,<br />\nbonds issued by the agency will be<br />\nexempt from federal and state<br />\ntaxation. They are thus more attractive to bond-holders, who need<br />\nnot pay taxes on income from the<br />\nbonds.<br />\nThe state will not have to donate<br />\nany revenues to the new Agency,<br />\nnor will the state's credit be on the<br />\nline when the Agency issues bonds.<br />\nThe authority will be set up with<br />\nrevenues allocated by the private<br />\ninstitutions themselves.<br />\n<br />\nThere appears to be little danger<br />\nthat the bill will not be passed in<br />\nthis session of the legislature. According to Frank DeFilippo, Governor Mandel's Press Secretary, no<br />\nopposition to the measure has<br />\nshown itself in either house. John<br />\nC. Eldridge, Legislative Aide to<br />\nMandel, said, \"How can anyone<br />\noppose it? There's not a penny of<br />\nstate money involved\u2014not even to<br />\nset the agency up.\"<br />\nHopkins will doubtless be the<br />\nschool to benefit most from the<br />\nnew agency. In his testimony,<br />\nGordon assured the members of<br />\nthe Finance Committee that Hopkins' planning $ 1 2 million per<br />\nyear. The total from all of Maryland's other institutions of higher<br />\nlearning will probably be considerably less than that figure.<br />\nAt present Hopkins is only planning one construction project<br />\nwhich might be financed through<br />\nthe new agency. The planned parking garage, to be constructed at a<br />\ncost of $3.5 million, might be financed in part or wholly by bonds<br />\nissued by the agency.<br />\n<br />\n\"For the next three years,\" Gordon stated,\"we anticipate no more<br />\nthan $5 million per year.\" He went<br />\non to say that he could not estimate the borrowing needs of the<br />\n\"hospital side.\" However, the total<br />\nhospital construction expenditures<br />\nin the entire state has averaged<br />\nonly about $12 million per year<br />\nfor the last two decades.<br />\nApart from new construction<br />\nprojects, the authority would be<br />\nable to lend money to colleges<br />\nand hospitals for the retirement ofy<br />\noutstanding loans and mortgages<br />\ncarrying higher interest rates.<br />\nAs it is presently construed, the<br />\nbill would apply equally to private<br />\nand state schools. There was a<br />\nproposal in committee, this week,<br />\nto eliminate state schools from<br />\nthe authority. State schools can<br />\nborrow money on the credit of the<br />\nstate; consequently at lower rates<br />\nof interest than would be made<br />\npossible by the new agency.<br />\nIn testimony supporting passage<br />\nof the bills, Gordon cited the successful establishment of similar<br />\nagencies in other states.<br />\n<br />\n\fFeb. 6, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nDorms Draw DSRC Complaint<br />\nBy RALPH MOLLER<br />\n<br />\nA common scene for the 585 students who inhabit Hopkins' dorms.<br />\n<br />\nGrowing dissatisfaction among dorm<br />\nresidents about their living conditions<br />\nhas aroused the normally impotent<br />\nDormitory Student Representative<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThis dissatisfaction was underscored<br />\nby a resolution passed in the Dormitory<br />\nStudent<br />\nRepresentative<br />\nCouncil on<br />\nThursday, January 29. It called for the<br />\nsecretary to send a letter of complaint<br />\nto the Baltimore City Department<br />\nof<br />\nHousing.<br />\nIn this letter, the DSRC said that it<br />\nat<br />\nfelt that the dormitory facilities<br />\nHopkins, \"particularly the old dormitory, do not meet the Building Code and<br />\nthat the University should be made aware<br />\nof these insufficiencies by the Bureau of<br />\nBuilding Inspection.\"<br />\nThe sponsor of this resolution Martin<br />\n<br />\nVogel, Vice-President of the DSRC,said<br />\nthat conditions in the old dorm such as the<br />\nabsence of fire escapes, insufficent<br />\nventilation and the lack of enough living<br />\nspace per person prompted him to take<br />\naction through the DSRC. He also stated<br />\nthat if the city found that the dormitories<br />\nwere substandard, it could compel the<br />\nUniversity to make repairs.<br />\nIf the dorms are declared substandard,<br />\nVogel added, hopes that the University<br />\nwould niake other changes that would<br />\nmake the dorms more comfortable for<br />\nthe residents<br />\n<br />\n\"Are in Violation\"<br />\nThere are differing opinions among<br />\nseveral administrators concerning the<br />\ndorms.

He confessed that he thought there might be<br />\nsome minor violations of the Baltimore<br />\nHousing Code, but the University would<br />\nnot be compelled by law to make repairs.<br />\nMcElwee said, however, that should<br />\nanything be uncovered, the University<br />\n\"would be willing to look at what the<br />\nInspector says.\"<br />\nAnother official of the University,<br />\nMr. John Peach, Assistant Plant Manager, held a different view.

The number is better<br />\nthan three times the quanity of applications received at<br />\nthis time last year.<br />\nIncluded in this number are nine applicationsfrom local<br />\nblack women interested in comingto Hopkins. Also, three<br />\nblack girls have filed applications to enter as transfer students next year.<br />\nOwens claimed that a major reason for the sharp increase in applications was that the admissions office<br />\n\"mounted a massive campaign\" to indicate that Hopkins<br />\nis interested in black students.<br />\nHe estimated that \"two<br />\nthousand students have been contacted to show students<br />\nthat we are interested.\"<br />\nMany blacks said that they had been interested<br />\nin Hopkins, but they had thought that Hopkins was<br />\nnot interested<br />\nIn them, Owens claimed.<br />\nOnce the interest was reciprocated, a strong response was received.<br />\nOwens attributed much of the success of the campaign<br />\nto black students presentl<br />\ny enrolled at Hopkins who devoted much of their intersession to talking<br />\nwith potential<br />\napplicants. Several blacks travelled around the country<br />\nto speak about Hopkins<br />\nwith high school seniors. The<br />\neffort was particularly intensive in Texas,<br />\nFlorida and<br />\nthroughout New England.<br />\nThere has been a nationwide distribution of<br />\napplicants,<br />\nbut a majority have come from the<br />\nEast Coast. Maryland,<br />\nNew York, New Jersey, and Pennsylv<br />\nania are the largest<br />\ncontributors of candidates with applications coming<br />\nfrom<br />\nCalifornia and some Western states.<br />\nOwens attributes the concentration to the fact<br />\nthat although Hopkins has a worldwide reputatio<br />\nn it is better<br />\nknown in the East than other parts of<br />\nthe country. He<br />\nindicated that the distribution of black applicants is not<br />\nSignificantly different from that of whites.<br />\n<br />\n\"This is probably the best way of recruiting for<br />\nyour school,\" said Owens, because if you can get current<br />\nstudents to push the school, then others will be more<br />\ninterested. He claimed that this could be the \"key to<br />\nthe whole thing.\"<br />\nA major concern of the campaign was to generate<br />\ninterest among black high school students in going to<br />\ncollege, then if they show interest they are asked to<br />\nconsider Hopkins. Owens is concerned with getting<br />\nmore blacks to go on to college as well as to get more<br />\nonto the Homewood campus.<br />\nOwens explained that when he goes to a high school<br />\nto recruit students, much of what he wants to do is to<br />\nshow that someone is interested in them. He then<br />\noffers Hopkins as a possible choice in an effort to<br />\n\"offer a broader choice of colleges.\"<br />\n.The admissions officer claimed that many of the students who have applied this year show great potential<br />\nas successful college students. \"A great number are<br />\narticulate and bright, but not all have been so good.<br />\nThat's the name of the game for admissions,\" said<br />\nOwens.<br />\nApplicants have indicated interest in varied fields,<br />\nranging from physics and chemistry to history or<br />\npsychology. Owens stated that he is pleased with the<br />\nblend in interest shown by those who want to come<br />\nto Hopkins.<br />\nThe admissions office now has to consider which of<br />\nthe students should be admitted to Hopkins. The next<br />\nmajor task is to get those who are accepted to come<br />\nto Hopkins next year. Owens said that many of the<br />\napplicants would probably get accepted by most of the<br />\nschools they apply to, and that Hopkins would have to<br />\nattract them to Homewood.<br />\nWilliam Brinkley, Director of Admissions, stated<br />\nthat he is very pleased with the work that Owens and<br />\nothers have done. He also expressed trust that more<br />\nblacks will come to Hopkins as a result of the program that has been conducted this year.<br />\n<br />\nRonald Owens, Assistant Director of Admissions:\"We mounted a massive offensive to indicate Hopkins' interest in black<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhites Asked to Drop Crowded Black Lit Class<br />\nBy RICHARD B.

His section<br />\nis comprised primarily of black students,<br />\nbut Moorer did admit two whites who<br />\napproached him personally.<br />\nMoorer refused to comment on his<br />\nstatements, Wednesday night.

It was later decided to<br />\naccomodate the female transfers in McCoy Hall.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee stated<br />\nthat the present housing plan would reduce the social mixing of undergraduates afforded by coeducation and would<br />\npose a serious financial burden on the<br />\ngraduate students evicted from McCoy.<br />\nIt was also feared by the SAC that<br />\nthe McCoy decision would become per-<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee meeting Wednesday adopted a resolution requesting<br />\nthat<br />\nfemale transfers be housed in the freshman dorms.<br />\n<br />\nmanent. \"There is a grave danger that<br />\nwhat was intended as a temporary solution would at best remain in force for a<br />\nnumber of years and at worst become a<br />\npermanent arrangement,\" the resolution<br />\ncommented.<br />\nThe Task Force originally submitted<br />\nthree plans for coed housing to the<br />\nAcademic Council. Their first suggestion would convert Wilson and Wood<br />\nHouses of the old dormitories to facilitate women. John McElwee, the plant<br />\nplanner, estimated $150,000 for a major<br />\noverhaul of the two dorms. The Task<br />\nForce Report, though, noted that the<br />\nhouses \"do not presently meet building<br />\ncode standards,\" therefore must be<br />\nrenovated in any case.<br />\nPlan<br />\nB recommended converting<br />\nAdams and Baker Houses into female<br />\ndorms. They placed the price tag at<br />\n$80,000, including wall-to-wall carpeting and additional furnishings in the<br />\nrooms.<br />\nThe SAC resolved to support Pan B<br />\nfrom the independent findings of their<br />\nSubcommittee on Housing. However,<br />\nthe Committee suggested that the absolute minimum be spent on renovating<br />\nthe two dorms. They estimated that<br />\ndue to Hopkins' financial difficulties,<br />\nmodifications in the bathroom facilities<br />\nwould cost $5,000 with an additional<br />\n$3,000 for a laundary room.<br />\nThe resolution concluded that the<br />\n\"serious disadvantages of the proposal<br />\nto use McCoy Hal...would be deeply<br />\nresented on good grounds by both major<br />\ngroups of existing students in the University.\"<br />\n<br />\nMacksey described the situation as<br />\n\"potentially explosive.\" He refused to<br />\nspeculate on future developments, but<br />\nstated that in the future, lectures would<br />\nfeature guest lecturers and the sections<br />\n\"will be allowed to go pretty much their<br />\nown way.\"<br />\nMacksey hypothesized that much of the<br />\nstimulus for Moorer's remarks might<br />\nhave come from the size rather than the<br />\nracial make-up of the class. \"I detest<br />\nbig classes,\" he said. He emphasized<br />\nthat only twenty to thirty students were<br />\nexpected to take the course. At the start<br />\nof the semester, instructors were confronted with 150 class-cards.<br />\nBefore the start of this semester,<br />\nthe course was planned as a seminar.<br />\nWith the tremendous number of students<br />\nwho elected to take the course, the<br />\nsyllabus was changed to include lectures<br />\nand sections. Besides Moorer's section<br />\non Negritude, Macksey teaches a smaller<br />\ngroup of students about Black poetry. A<br />\nthird section, dealingwith autobiography,<br />\nis taught by Bob Hyde, a black senior.<br />\nThe fourth section, dealingwith fiction, is<br />\ntaught by Eleanor Wilner, a white graduate student in the Humanities Center.<br />\nThe course was originally conceived<br />\nby Moorer, who taught a similar course<br />\nto a largely white class last spring.<br />\nMacksey states that he recognizes the<br />\nneed for such a course although he feels unqualified to teach it himself. \"This<br />\nis a course I would like to take,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"but God knows not teach.\"<br />\nMoorer confirmed that he was disturbed by the number of students in the<br />\ncourse. \"We were expecting about twenty students at the most. We got entirely<br />\ntoo many students,\" he said.<br />\nA random sample of white students<br />\nleaving the classroom confirmed Macksey's belief that few would leave the<br />\ncourse. Many angered that they were<br />\nasked to leave at all. Macksey referred<br />\nto whites' confusion and anger by saying<br />\nthat Moorer had \"certainly opened himself to misunderstaning today.\" Macksey asked that whites look at Moorer's<br />\nactions of the last year carefully, however. In the spring term of last year,<br />\nMoorer taught Black Literature to white<br />\nstudents and received no salary for his<br />\nlabor.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 6, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nWolman: Militancy Needed for Conservation<br />\nBy STEVE BUCKINGHAM<br />\nLast Wednesday Dr. Abel Wolman<br />\nfurnished a group of interested listeners a large amount of information and<br />\nopinion relating to a subject which has<br />\nrecently become a matter of much public<br />\nconcern; water pollution.<br />\nDr. Wolman, one of the University's<br />\nProfessors Emeritus, gave his views<br />\non the management of the Chesapeake<br />\nBay to a crowded room of over 40<br />\npeople in the top of Ames Hall. Among<br />\nthose present were students and many<br />\nfaculty members including Dr. M. G.<br />\nWolman of the Georgraphy and Environmental<br />\nEngineering Department, the<br />\nspeaker's son.<br />\nAfter noting the grave problems confronting the Bay at the present and the<br />\nevents leading to their existence, he<br />\nturned to the attempts to solve them.<br />\nThere are, he said, thirty-nine administrative agencies concerned with management of the Bay. And from these<br />\nagencies have come a few similar recommendations for action.<br />\nAll of these groups propose additional study. This seems to be, according<br />\nto Wolman, \"the number-one solution,<br />\nnot always emanating from academic,<br />\nbut from commissioners created to do<br />\nthis, to do that. As someone has said<br />\nrecently on the Federal level, 'If you<br />\ndon't want anything done, appoint a<br />\ncommission to inquire it.\" Dr. Wolman criticized this as an answer to<br />\nthe problem because it provided for<br />\nno action, just study.<br />\nThe second possible action is the<br />\ndeclaration of a moratorium on all<br />\ndecisions and actions. This, of course,<br />\nis a very negative approach. Any public<br />\nofficial concerned with management of<br />\n<br />\nthe Chesapeake could say that he does<br />\nnot know enough and therefore should<br />\nnot act at all.<br />\nThe last recommendation that is frequently made is concerned with reorganization. \"Whenever anyone's confronted with a dilemma, again looking<br />\nfor a scapegoat if necessary, one recommends reorganization,\" argued Dr.<br />\nWolman.<br />\n\"A militant public opinion is obviously mandatory. However, it generates in<br />\nits wake vices as well as virtues unless it carries with it a full understanding of its militancy.\" Dr. Wolman stated that immediate action is<br />\nnecessary. Even if one in ten people<br />\nin Maryland was to do something about<br />\nthe Bay today, there would be more<br />\nthan enough existing programs waiting<br />\nto be carried out. These programs<br />\n\"do not have to depend on the emergence of additional scientific and technological information. They are worth<br />\ndoing regardless of what their future<br />\nresults may prove to be.\"<br />\nDr. Wolman expressed hope that the<br />\nGovernor's office would take a responsible role in managing the Chesapeake.<br />\n\"I have the feeling that integration (of<br />\nall the existing agencies) in the state<br />\nof Maryland with respect to the Bay<br />\ncan and must be provided at the chief<br />\nexecutive level. There is that opportunity, and let us presume that it (probably) will be made.\"<br />\nOne action by which the chief executive's office could make its influence<br />\nknown, is an attack on the legislative<br />\ntactics of the shellfish industry. Until<br />\nrecently, a small group representing<br />\nthe fishermen controlled the legislative<br />\nactions concerning the Bay. One of<br />\nMaryland's past governors even bowed<br />\n<br />\nhad to do with the three main polluters<br />\nof the Bay; the Baltimore Area,the Washington suburbs and the District of Columbia. There are, it seems, projected programs among the three areas amounting<br />\nto almost $500 million. Dr. Wolman<br />\nsuggested that these projects be immediately implemented. Here he noted that<br />\n\"perhaps half of that ($500 million) is<br />\nresident in the District of Columbia<br />\nwhere there is a kind of schizophrenia.<br />\nThat money from the District of Columbia must come out of the Federal Government which preaches the correction of<br />\neverything else, everywhere. This is<br />\nwhat I call an irony of political demonstration.\"<br />\n<br />\nto their pressure and withdrew his entire slate of bills affecting the Bay's<br />\nmanagement.<br />\nThe management of the Chesapeake<br />\nBay, Dr. Wolman contended, must find<br />\nits priority in relation to the other<br />\nitems in the state's budget. Not everything, of course, can be first priority,<br />\nand there never seems to be enough<br />\nmoney for all of the programs, despite<br />\nAmerica's affluence. But, Dr. Wolman<br />\nobserved \"our choices in the state of<br />\nMaryland are fairly clear; how much<br />\nmoney do we want to put into the management of the Bay, not how do we keep<br />\nreorganizing its management.\"<br />\nOne point brought up by Dr. Wolman<br />\n<br />\nParnstormers<br />\n<br />\nAttu\u2014<br />\nThe Barnstormers will be presenting \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" next weekend in Shriver<br />\nHall.

The<br />\nCommittee was appointed last month by<br />\nDr. Michael Beer, Vice-Chairman of the<br />\nGeneral Assembly. Beer, who was given<br />\nthe power to appoint the Committee in<br />\na faculty ballot in December, said that<br />\nhe had difficulty in getting faculty members to serve.<br />\nIn appointing the faculty members,<br />\nBeer indicated that he had looked for a<br />\nwide distribution in disciplines. The<br />\nmembers of the Committee are Dr.<br />\nWoodford Howard of Political Science,<br />\nDr. John Baldwin of History, Dr. Maurice Bessman of Biology, Dr. Jan Minkowski of Electrical Engineering and<br />\nProfessor Jerome Perlstein of Chemistry.<br />\nBeer said that he had avoided<br />\nfaculty members with extreme views<br />\non the governance issue.<br />\nThe Committee met with Beer a couple<br />\n<br />\nof weeks ago to clarify their task. They<br />\nchose Howard as chairman because, as<br />\nBessman put it, Howard i s in Political<br />\nScience and i s perhaps better qualified<br />\nto handle the post. Howard was not<br />\npresent at the meeting. The Committee<br />\nhad its first formal meeting at the<br />\nFaculty Club yesterday.<br />\n<br />\nThe Academic Council has charged<br />\nthe Committee with determining \"the<br />\n<br />\nmagnitude of. dissatisfaction (with the<br />\ngovernance of the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences) and recommend procedures.\"<br />\nA proposal that might be considered by<br />\nthe Committee if it finds enough \"dissatisfaction\" was offered by Dr. Francis Rourke, Chairman of the Political<br />\nScience Department. Rourke suggested<br />\nthat if a second Committee was recommended by the present one, it should be<br />\npaid to work over the summer. Such a<br />\nstep, said Rourke, would \"keep the<br />\nmomentun of such a study going.\"<br />\nThere has been no recent student<br />\naction on the governance issue. The<br />\nStudent Council has not had a quorum<br />\nat its rec9nt meetings, but some members stated that they will discuss governance at their Monday meeting.<br />\n<br />\n\"Keep Momentum\"<br />\nHoward declined to comment on Committee plans. He felt that his own opinions might be misinterpreted as those<br />\nof the Committee's, and would create<br />\nmisunderstanding before the Committee<br />\nhad even met. Howard said that he would<br />\ndiscuss Committee business as soon as<br />\nit started its planning.<br />\nBessman said that he \"hadn't been<br />\nthinking\" about the problems of governance before he was appointed to<br />\nserve on the Committee. He accepted<br />\nthe post, he said, as part of his \"university obligation.\" Bessman believed<br />\nthat he would be able to learn more<br />\nabout the subject through his committee work. Other Committee members<br />\ncould not be reached for comment.<br />\n<br />\nBob Cotter, President of the Graduate Students Organization said, \"We<br />\nhaven't done anything about the governance issue.\" Cotter also said that<br />\nhe was \"puzzled on how to approach<br />\nit,\" although he opposed putting the<br />\nissue into faculty hands. \"I am against<br />\nthe faculty doing this (governance) on<br />\nits own,\" he stated.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Woodford Howard of Political Science<br />\nwas chosen to head the ad hoc Governance<br />\nCommittee due to his scholarly knowledge<br />\nof politics.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022=11.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nWe need yotii head<br />\nbusiness<br />\n<br />\nPt.

With funds provided<br />\nby the National Institute of Mental Health,<br />\nhe and his group did research at schools,<br />\njuvenile courts and law enforcement agencies.<br />\nHe described the drug abuse problem<br />\nas being \"like an iceberg,\" in that most<br />\nof it is not visible to the public. He<br />\nfound that few people except addicts<br />\nand law enforcement officers were able<br />\nto speak intelligently about drugs. His<br />\nresearch team discovered 700 addicts,<br />\n<br />\nforty-five per cent of whom were unknown to federal agencies. One signifigant finding of the study was that, in<br />\nthe past thirty-five years, the average<br />\nage of drug users has fallen from<br />\nthirty-five to twenty-one.<br />\nTo cope with the increasing drug<br />\nproblem, Nurco has developed a program consisting of four parts: education, prevention, management and treatment, and reserach and planning. Education will require \"teaching both the<br />\npositive and negative values of drugs...<br />\nCurriculum on drugs would be added to<br />\nall schools, grade schools to college.\"<br />\nPrevention involves \"specific places<br />\naround the state where those interested<br />\nor involved in the problem can be dealt<br />\nwith on a short-term basis.\"<br />\nNurco's third area of concern, management and treatment, will consist of<br />\nall programs throughout the state.

Frequently<br />\nconfused with hallucinatons, are what<br />\nWeil terms \"illusions\".<br />\n\"Perception becomes interpretable in<br />\ndifferent ways\", said Weil, \"A person<br />\nwho has taken marijuana can play with<br />\nhis visual perception,\" which is controlled, whereas a hallucination is a<br />\npurdy physical reaction induced by a<br />\ndrug.<br />\nWell also noted that marijuana en-<br />\n<br />\nables the user to control his auditory<br />\nperception. This explains why musicinduced pleasure is enhanced when one<br />\nis under the influence of marijuana.<br />\nThe physical affects of marijuana<br />\nare an increase in heartbeat, a drop<br />\nin blood pressure, a reddenning of the<br />\nwhites of the eyes and a dryness in<br />\nthe mouth.

In trying to explain why people<br />\ntake drugs, he elaborated on the concept<br />\nof \"escape and quest.\" He cited historical examples, ranging from Homer's<br />\n\"Odyssey\" to Tennyson's \"The Lotus<br />\nEaters.\"<br />\n\"They want on the one side to escape<br />\nfrom, fight against, defend against something and on the other they search for<br />\nsomething new, something better. Actually the second aspect is neglected in<br />\nthe discussion of drugs. It's always<br />\nthe escape aspect, not the search aspect<br />\nwhich is looked upon. All drug abuse<br />\ncan be explained by the law of escape<br />\nand quest, though the emphasis may<br />\nvary,\" Wurmser explained.<br />\nHe then identified four possible causes<br />\nof the drug user's attempts at escape<br />\nand quest. One was \"the individual<br />\nand his inner conflict,\" which he considered an outgrowth of modern society.<br />\nFamily background and the social condition were two others. The philosophical problem involved was the fourth<br />\npossible cause.<br />\nWurmser said that<br />\nusers claim they find \"a new integrity<br />\nby negation of old values.\"<br />\nPersonalities Jackie Robinson and<br />\nMarty Milner also spoke. Robinson<br />\naddressed the audience as a parent<br />\nwhose son was involved in the drug<br />\nproblem. His son is enrolled in Daytop, Inc., which is a self-help program<br />\n<br />\nrun by addicts.<br />\nAccording to Robinson, \"the biggest<br />\nproblem is fear in the homes of the<br />\nparents.\" He explained that they fear<br />\nruining their good images in the neighborhood and also upsetting their children. Because of these fears, they avoid<br />\ndiscussing drugs with their children<br />\nbefore they are exposed to them outside the home. Similarly, they avoid<br />\ndealing fully with any drug problem<br />\nthat their children do develop.<br />\nMartin Milner also spoke about adult<br />\nshortcomings. He works closelywith the<br />\nLos Angeles Police Department as the<br />\nstar of the television show \"Adam-12.\"<br />\nFrom this vantage point, he has been<br />\nexposed to the drug problem on a larger<br />\nscale than have most citizens.<br />\nHe spoke as a concerned citizen reacting against the hypocrisy of adults. As<br />\nan example he cited adult acceptance of<br />\nsuch marketed products as Compoz and<br />\nNo Doz. He said that such acceptance<br />\nis inconsistent with their condemnation<br />\nof the very similar pills, called \"ups\"<br />\nand \"downs,\" used by students.<br />\nDuring<br />\nthe<br />\nquestion-and -answer<br />\nperiod that followed the speeches, the<br />\nissue of the legalization of marijuana<br />\narose. Drs.Spiro and Wurmser expressed differing points of view.<br />\nSpiro opposed legalization on the<br />\ngrounds that he was unsure of experimental findings. From his work he has<br />\nfound that the drug can lead to withdrawal from society if used on a longterm basis and to psychotic disorders<br />\nif used on a short-term basis. Wurmser considered the issue of legalization<br />\nsubordinate to regulation of the drug<br />\nfrom its sources.<br />\n<br />\nJeep ;<br />\n<br />\nSUBS<br />\nPIZZA<br />\n<br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nSPAGHETTI<br />\nHOME MADE<br />\nCHICKEN<br />\nWITH FRENCH<br />\nPRIES AND ENGLISH MUFFIN<br />\n<br />\nThe Very Best<br />\n<br />\nHARRY LITTLE<br />\nCarry Out Shops<br />\n32nd near Greenmount<br />\n25th near Greenmount<br />\n<br />\nFull line of<br />\n4-wheel drive<br />\nwork and play<br />\nvehicles.<br />\nsat<br />\n6 OR V8 Aitiwl<br />\nWAGONEER<br />\nGLADIATOR<br />\n4 OR V6<br />\nUNIVERSAL<br />\nEXCITING lEEPSTER' SERIES!<br />\nTAKE A TEST DRIVE TODAY!<br />\n<br />\nSALES\u2022SERVICE\u2022 PARTS<br />\nFINE SELECTION OF USED CARS<br />\n<br />\nHERRING JEEP<br />\n310 W. 27<br />\n<br />\n889-1719<br />\n<br />\nA great place<br />\nto drink<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's finest<br />\nwatering hole<br />\n<br />\nWEST WOOD'S<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nHopkius students, newt au old, eat dt:<br />\n<br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\nfor the finest Italian food in tows<br />\n<br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nSPAGHETTI MEALS<br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br />\n<br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE<br />\nCALL 889-3831<br />\n<br />\nMARES HEAD<br />\n<br />\nINN j<br />\nFeaturing the finest in domestic and imported beers and wines.<br />\n<br />\nLive below your means<br />\nIf you'd like to get around the high cost of living,<br />\nwe have a suggestion.<br />\nCut down on the high cost of getting around.<br />\nAnd buy a Voolkswagen.

Surprise!<br />\nIt should surprise no one that Lincoln Gordon has rewritten the draft of<br />\nthe discipline code submitted to him by the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs, and in substance completely rejected the recommendations of the<br />\nCommittee. Dr. Gordon is a firm proponent of committees, student \"input\" and other administrative devices. However, when the duly constituted committee on Student Affairs released the findings of four months'<br />\nwork, and issued a reasonable version of Dr. Gordon's discipline code, he<br />\nsaw nothing amiss in returning the code to its original intolerable form.<br />\nThe fact that the committee was not contacted after it had released its<br />\nreport is not surprising either, considering Dr. Gordon's obvious disregard<br />\nfor its recommendations.<br />\nIn September, Dr. Gordon proposed a discipline code which was objectionable on two counts primarily. The first point involved the possibility<br />\nof expulsion for an offending student. The second involved the composition of the review board. At the time, Dr. Gordon's plan was to man the<br />\nreview board with two students, two faculty members and one administrator.<br />\nThe Committee on Student Affairs studied the proposal and recomended that both of these facets of the code be altered. Expulsion, the report<br />\nof the committee contends, does not allow for the possibility of rehabilitation and concentrates on punishing, rather than reforming the student<br />\ninvolved. The committee recommended that long-term suspension be the<br />\nseverest penalty admissible.<br />\nDr. Gordon promptly replaced expulsion on the list of admissible<br />\npenalties. It apparently does not concern Dr. Gordon that a student who<br />\nis expelled carries that stigma throughout his life. Expulsion is irrevocable.<br />\nThe President's rationale for this move centers on the fact that the student<br />\ncan always reapply through normal admissions procedures. It would be<br />\nunfeasible, his report reads, to have two manners of admitting students.<br />\nHow many students does Dr. Gordon plan to kick out? Would their numbers place such a strain on Hopkins' bureaucratic workings?<br />\nThe Committee on Student Affairs also changed the composition of the<br />\nreview board for the better. Instead of two students, two faculty members and an administrator, the Committee's review board was comprised of<br />\ntwo undergraduates, two graduate students, two faculty members and an<br />\nadministrator. It seems only reasonable that students should be in the<br />\nmajority of a board which is called upon to judge only students. The<br />\nCommittee added the administrator to'the board only when Dr. Gordon<br />\ninsisted.<br />\nBut a lone administrator here and there is not enough for Dr. Gordon<br />\nHe completely reversed the Committee's recommendations and swung the<br />\nbalance on the board away from the students again. Dr. Gordon insists<br />\nthat faculty and students have an equal number of representatives with an<br />\nadministrator holding the deciding vote.<br />\nIn justifying ignoring this part of the Committee's recommendations, Dr.<br />\nGordon states that since Hopkins is a community (uh huh), all segments<br />\nof the University should get equal representation. Should all segments of<br />\nthe community be subject to this discipline code? Should not any consideration be given to the fact that the students comprise eighty-five percent of this community? Does equal representation involve giving an administrator the swing-vote on the review board for students?<br />\nIf Hopkins is truly a community, Dr. Gordon would agree that every<br />\nsegment of that community should be accorded the respect which accrues<br />\nto an equal partner. Unfortunately, he is not long on respect when a<br />\ncommittee tries to tamper with one of his master-plans. Such tamperings<br />\ntend to get ignored.<br />\nAnd if anyone is upset, all he need do is sign a petition protesting any<br />\npart of the President's statement. Dr. Gordon does not expect to see such<br />\na petition. If students want to see a just discipline policy, however, they<br />\nwill have to put together just such a petition, at least as a first step. We<br />\nsuggest that if the Student Council can raise a quorum, the organization<br />\nfor a petition might be a welcome reminder of the Council's existence<br />\nThe Graduate Student Organization and concerned faculty members<br />\nshould make a similar effort. We must warn, however, that getting Dr.<br />\nGordon to rethink a section of his discipline code will probably net yield a<br />\nreasonable policy.

It all began<br />\nin the Summer of 1968. Lincoln Gordon<br />\nhad read all about the mean students at<br />\nColumbia in Time and seen all those<br />\npictures of them in Life, and he thought<br />\nto himself, \"It can't happen here at the<br />\nHop!\"<br />\nAnd, so, what did he do? Why just what<br />\nyou or I would have done in such a situation; he appointed an Ad Hoc Committee,<br />\none of the all time great panaceas of<br />\ncollege presidents. And he charged this<br />\ngroup of learned men to go out among all<br />\nthe lands a return several months hence<br />\nwith a report which would explain how to<br />\nkeep these unruly mobs in hand.<br />\n'Twas not just the frosh and sophs who<br />\nhave no direction in life that Gordo feared; he also cowered at the thought of confronting an unruly group of rhetoricspouting, placard-carrying Hygiene students. And so this report was to apply<br />\nto all parts of this great University(does<br />\nanybody know the postage rates to<br />\nBologna, Italy?).<br />\n<br />\nA New Arrival<br />\nThus it was that in late spring of the<br />\nyear of our sit-in 2969 that Ad Hoc<br />\nand his committee gave birth to a \"Proposed Policy Statement on Student Conduct,\" and presented it to Lincoln, who<br />\nsmiled, and Wiped the sweat off his brow<br />\nand breathed a sigh of relief, as know<br />\nhe knew that the Georgian calm of his<br />\ncampus was secure from the political<br />\nupheaval he had known so well in Brazil.<br />\nBut, had you observed him reading<br />\nthe report, you would have seen a furrow<br />\ncross his brow. His trusted friend Ad<br />\nHoc had let him down; for here it said<br />\nthat a group of seven was to pass judgement on offenders and that four of those<br />\nseven were to be students; members of<br />\nthe unruly mob that he sought to temper.<br />\nBut Lincoln had not exhausted his remedies. After all, he was president! So,<br />\nhe simply sat down and changed the report around. Five people on the board,<br />\nand only two of them would be students.<br />\nAnd then, just to be sure, he stood in<br />\nfront of the meek freshmen and told them<br />\nof the report and its provisions and that<br />\nthey had better watch out no matter what<br />\nthey had read in the newspapers.<br />\n<br />\nThe Rape of the Report<br />\nSo, this newly revised edition was sent<br />\noff to nice, sane administrators and faculty in the hopes that they would tell Lincoln what a nice job he had done. But lo,<br />\nanother committee took hold of his report<br />\nand began to tear it asunder.It was comforting when the sane people in the Med<br />\nSchool and School of Hygiene and SAIS<br />\ntold him it was okay; never mind that<br />\nthe Student Government at the school of<br />\nHygiene had voted unanimously to reject<br />\neven the idea of such a policy.<br />\nOh, but at the Homewood campus this<br />\ncommittee was writing a whole new report. And after they worked and slaved<br />\nfor several months, they sent it in, and<br />\nthere, again, were the four students on a<br />\nboard of seven. A professor in the math<br />\ndepartment told him again that this was a<br />\nmajority, and he went into a titter. What<br />\ncould he do? For not only had they put all<br />\nof these students on this panel, but they<br />\nhad included reasons for their actions!<br />\nAnd what actions they were. No more<br />\nexpulsions! Like the general in Catch 22<br />\nwho knew he could shoot anyone he wanted to, Lincoln just knew that he could expel!. students.It was a Gilman-given right.<br />\nFurther, they said that students could be<br />\npunished only for abridging someone's<br />\nrights. There wasn't mention of the University running like a well-oiled machine.<br />\nSomeone certainly should be punished for<br />\nbeing a loose cog. And then they wanted<br />\nthis board to meet in the public, where<br />\neven the rabble could view its proceedings.<br />\n<br />\nReasonable Reasons?<br />\nWhat could he do? Of course such ideas<br />\n<br />\nas these could not be tolerated, but they<br />\nhad given reasons for these pats of their<br />\nreport, and so he must give reasons back.<br />\nAnother committee would not do, they had<br />\nlet him down twice already. So he had to<br />\nset out and do another revision.He would<br />\nstick with seven people on the board,but<br />\nonly three would be students. There would<br />\nalso be three faculty members and an<br />\nadministrator. The math department assured him that the good guys had a majority.<br />\n<br />\nForbidden Fruit<br />\nBut why? He needed a reason. And so<br />\nhe sat and wrote that no one segment of<br />\nthe University community should have<br />\na majority on such an important board.<br />\nThis looked real good since he had just<br />\nsaid that the other reports had wanted<br />\nfour students out of seven members.<br />\nNever mind that the committees had actually called for truly equal representation with two undergrads and two grads,<br />\nand that his make-up would guarantee<br />\nthat one of these groups would be shortchanged. Never mind that it made no<br />\nsense, it looked good and he had his<br />\nmajority.<br />\nAnd then he threw expulsions back in.<br />\nWhy, he wrote, we cannot have the school<br />\nacting as a rehabilitation agency. This,<br />\ntoo, sounded good, despite the fact no<br />\none had asked the school to be a rehabilitation agency, they only asked that the<br />\nreview board see once a year whether the<br />\nstudent might have been rehabilitated.<br />\nThis once-a-year appeal was also too<br />\nmuch for Lincoln. He let his paranoia<br />\nslip into his statement, expressing his<br />\nfear that this annual appeal might turn<br />\ninto a \"sideshow to be exploited for its<br />\npublicity potential.\" Never mind about<br />\naccomplishing justice, but God forbid<br />\nthat we have any sideshows.<br />\nFORBIDDEN FRUI<br />\nAnd then, there was the clincher. Lincoln wrote that such a policy gave the<br />\nstudents tenure, and Lord knows they<br />\ncan't have that. After all, professors<br />\nhave to sweat their balls off to get tenure<br />\naround here, and can you imagine students having something professors don't<br />\nhave many times over? God further forbid.<br />\n<br />\nAnd thus it was that Lincoln showed<br />\nthe world his paranoia as he thrust expulsion back into discipline. But now he<br />\nmust have some reason for punishing<br />\npeople who abridged no one's rights. And<br />\nso it came to pass that students could<br />\nnot harm the \"effective functioning\" of<br />\nthe University. The wheels must keep<br />\nturning, even over all those that got in<br />\nits way. Lincoln declared that the previous document was open to much too<br />\nmuch interpretatio, and thus this must<br />\ngo in.<br />\nAnd then Lincoln let his true colors<br />\nshine even more brightly as he wrote<br />\nthe reason for allowing the review board<br />\nto close its hearings. The paranoia oozes<br />\nall over the page as the Link writes that<br />\nopen meetings \"might invite disruptive<br />\ntactics.\" Never mind the spectre that<br />\nrises with such secrecy, never mind \"a<br />\nspeedy and Public trial,\" but please do<br />\nnot let us have any disruptive tactics.<br />\n<br />\nFor a Democratic Society<br />\nAnd so Lincoln sat back and looked<br />\nat his work and thought that it was good.<br />\nTo keep down the cries of totalitarianism<br />\nhe allows the community to petition, at<br />\nwhich time he will give serious consideration to amendments suggested by a<br />\nmere 25% of the student body. Never mind<br />\nthe fact that he had already ignored the<br />\nrecommendations of the closest thing to<br />\na democratic committee this University<br />\nhas. Never mind that he had just beaten<br />\ndown students that had tried to ac,<br />\nomn(continued on page 10<br />\n<br />\n\fFeb. 6, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER SUPPLEMENT<br />\n<br />\nA News-Letter Supple ment<br />\n<br />\nPRESIDENT'S STATEMENT ON DISCIPLINE<br />\n<br />\nThe President's Conduct Policy Proposal<br />\nPROPOSED POLICY STATEMENT<br />\nON STUDENT CONDUCT<br />\nTo the Members of The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Community:<br />\nDuring the summer of 1968, reflecting<br />\non well-known events arising from campus<br />\ntensions at a number of other universities, I<br />\nbecame concerned at the fact that Johns<br />\nHopkins has no formal policy on matters of<br />\nof student conduct which might adversely<br />\naffect the rights of others within the community or related to it, or otherwise impair<br />\nthe integrity of our academic enterprise.<br />\nUnder the terms of the University's Charter<br />\nand By-Laws, responsibility for such matters<br />\nhas for many decades been delegated by the<br />\nTrustees to the President, who \"shall, as<br />\neducational and administrative head of the<br />\nUniver\u00a7ity, exercise a general superintendence<br />\nover all' the affairs of the institution, and<br />\nbring such matters to the attention of the<br />\nBoard as he may think appropriate\" (Article<br />\nIV, Section 1).<br />\nIt seemed to me undesirable that this<br />\nbroad authority should remain wholly without<br />\ndefinition of the standards of behavior appropriate to the University and without some<br />\nequitable mechanism to determine the facts<br />\nin specific cases and if necessary to recommend the application of sanctions. Happily,<br />\nour recent experience makes clear that there<br />\ndoes now exist a widely shared consensus on<br />\nthe ways in which different segments of the<br />\ncommunity should seek to advance their interests and concerns, even though there are<br />\nmany differences of view on the best machinery of decision-making for our several divisions and for the University as a whole.<br />\nIf a serious crisis had arisen during my<br />\ntenure thus far as President, it was my intention to establish on an ad hoc basis some kind<br />\nof joint body drawn from the appropriate<br />\nstudent, faculty, and administration segments<br />\nof the community to assist me in the exercise<br />\nof my disciplinary authority. I believe it preferable, however, that there should be available in writing a broad statement of policy on<br />\nthese matters and a regularized procedure for<br />\ndealing with them.<br />\nThe general norms of appropriate behavior for the University community should<br />\nobviously be university-wide in character.<br />\nSince the Division of Arts and Sciences<br />\naccounts for by far the largest number of fulltime students, I thought it best to ask that<br />\nDivision to take the initiative in developing a<br />\nproposal for general consideration. To this<br />\nend, in the fall of 1968 I requested .Dean<br />\nAllyn W. Kimball to establish an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to recommend a proposed policy<br />\nstatement which might be university-wide in<br />\napplication, including both the standards of<br />\nbehavior and the procedural arrangements to<br />\nprovide for their application to specific cases.<br />\nThe ad hoc Committee devoted a great<br />\ndeal of time to this matter during the subsequent several \u2022 . months, leading to a,._draft._<br />\n<br />\npolicy statement which was sent to me on<br />\nMay 29, 1969. While most of its proposals<br />\nseemed to me sound, there were a few respects<br />\nin which I felt it could be improved, I therefore prepared a revised draft, which I transmitted to members of the ad hoc Committee<br />\non July 7, 1969, with a letter of explanation.<br />\nI also sent the revised draft to each of the<br />\nacademic deans with a request that they<br />\nconsult with such faculty and student representatives they thought appropriate and report the comments or suggestions during the<br />\nfall of 1969 in order that a final statement<br />\nmight be prepared.<br />\nDuring the fall of 1969, I received replies from the Deans of the Schools of<br />\nMedicine, Hygiene and Public Health, and<br />\nAdvanced International Studies, indicating<br />\nthat they found the July 7 draft acceptable.<br />\n<br />\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN GORDON<br />\n<br />\nI also received comments from a number of<br />\nindividual faculty members in various divisions, some of whom raised doubts as to<br />\nwhether the third paragraph of the then proposed definition of behavior subject to sanctions (which I had taken intact from the<br />\nad hoc Committee's proposal) might be excessively broad and subject to misinterpretation.<br />\nIn the case of the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences, Dean Kimball referred the July 7<br />\nto the Committee on Student Affairs,<br />\ndraft,<br />\n_<br />\nwhich made its comments and suggestions in<br />\nthe form of a complete redraft. This was<br />\ntransmitted to me, along with an explanatory<br />\nstatement, by Dr. John White, Chairman of<br />\nthe Committee, with a covering letter dated<br />\nJanuary 5, 1970. In Dean Kimball's official<br />\nletter of transmission, he stated some concern<br />\non a number of the modifications suggested<br />\nby the Student Affairs Committee, notably<br />\non one aspect of the definition of unaccept#ble.beh,ayior, the sanctiort of.ANDuisioa.-.and--<br />\n<br />\nthe reserve authority of the President and the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.<br />\nThe net result so far, therefore, has been<br />\nthe preparation of three draft statements, all<br />\nof which contain a substantial amount of<br />\ncommon content but which also contain<br />\nsignificant differences. Three of our academic<br />\ndivisions have found the July 7 draft acceptable, whereas the Arts and Sciences Committee on Student Affairs recommends significant<br />\ndepartures from the proposals contained in<br />\nthat draft.<br />\nIt has been suggested to me that it might<br />\nbe appropriate to constitute still another<br />\nad hoc committee on a university wide basis<br />\nto seek to reconcile the differences and<br />\nproduce yet another consolidated draft, but I<br />\nam hesitant to impose this further burden on<br />\nbusy individuals in view of the year and a half<br />\nof devoted effort already applied to the matter by so many members of the community.<br />\nI have therefore prepared a revised draft<br />\nstatement in the light of the three previous<br />\ndrafts, the comments received from the various deans, the written views of faculty<br />\nmembers already mentioned, and the explanatory statement transmitted by the Arts<br />\nand Sciences Committee on Student Affairs<br />\non January 5. The revised proposal is appended hereto.<br />\nThe reasoning underlying the main provisions of this final draft may be summarized<br />\nas follows.<br />\n1. Introduction \u2014 Preamble<br />\nThe substance of the preambular statements is similar in all three drafts. Since the<br />\nversion of the Committee on Student Affairs<br />\nis the shortest and simplest, I have incorporated it intact in the new proposal.<br />\n2. Introduction \u2014 Definition of Behavior<br />\nSubject to Sanctions<br />\nThis definition was identical in the drafts<br />\nof May 29 and July 7, and was substantially<br />\ncondensed in the proposal of the Committee<br />\non Student Aftairs. The latter version omitted<br />\nthe original third paragraph referring to the<br />\nrelationship of the University to the larger<br />\ncommunity, incorporating a portion of this<br />\nconcept under the phrase \"the rights of other<br />\nindividuals or groups,\" with the explanatory<br />\nstatement making clear that this covers both<br />\nthe University community and the larger<br />\ncommunity of which it is a part. The Student<br />\nAffairs Committee draft also omitted reference to the \"interests\" (as contrasted with<br />\n\"rights\") of others and omitted reference to<br />\ndisruption of \"the normal functioning of the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nThe stated reasons for the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee revision are generally persuasive except on one point. That is the<br />\nabsence of any explicit recognition of the<br />\nbroad institutional interest in the effective<br />\nfunctioning of the University. Since the term<br />\n\"groups\" is intended to cover formal and<br />\ninstitutional groups as well as informal groups',<br />\nit might be argued that it is all-embracing,<br />\nbut it might also be construed as requiring-in<br />\n<br />\n\fPRESIDENT'S STATEMENT ON DISCIPLINE<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 6, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER SUPPLEMENT<br />\n<br />\nDraft Abolishes Immediate Interim Expulsion<br />\n(continued from preceding page)<br />\n<br />\neach case an identification of and representations by the injured parties. At the same<br />\ntime, the ambiguity of the term \"normal<br />\nfunctioning\" is properly criticized in the<br />\nexplanatory statement of the Student Affairs<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nIn any event, a broad definition of this<br />\ntype must depend upon interpretation and<br />\napplication to specific cases by quasi-judicial<br />\nprocedures. The argument of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee that particular sections of<br />\nthe University might construe the standards<br />\nin any way they like is scarcely persuasive,<br />\nsince it is the Review Boards which will have<br />\nthe responsibility of definition in particular<br />\ncases.<br />\nIn the light of all these considerations,<br />\nthe new draft incorporates the shorter version<br />\nproposed by the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs with the final clause modified as<br />\nfollows: \"or conduct that impairs the effective functioning of the University or causes<br />\ndamage to its physical facilities.\"<br />\n3. Interim Suspension, Definitive Suspension, and Expulsion<br />\nThe July 7 draft distinguished between<br />\nminor and major sanctions, the latter consisting of definitive suspension or expulsion<br />\nwhich could not be imposed without prior<br />\naction by a Review Board. In emergency<br />\ncases, it provided for the administrative imposition of \"immediate interim suspension,\"<br />\nsubject to prompt subsequent consideration<br />\nby a Review Board.<br />\nThe Committee on Student Affairs recommended the elimination of the concept of<br />\nimmediate interim suspension, for the reasons<br />\nset forth in Section 17 of its explanatory<br />\nstatement. The Committee emphasized that<br />\nthe retention of student status during an<br />\nemergency implies no special protection from<br />\naction by the civil authorities should that become necessary. The Committee draft also<br />\nprovided for an emergency convocation of the<br />\nReview Board (no later than the next day) in<br />\nemergency cases. On balance, these points are<br />\npersuasive to me, and the new proposed draft<br />\ntherefore also omits provision for immediate<br />\ninterim suspension.<br />\nThe Committee on Student Affairs also<br />\nproposed that the sanction of expulsion be<br />\nabolished, although it is not clear whether<br />\nthis proposal was meant to apply to academic<br />\nperformance as well as to student conduct.<br />\nTermination of student status for sustained<br />\nmeet minimum academic<br />\nfailure<br />\nto<br />\nstandards is a long-standing feature of the<br />\nacademic scene at all universities, including<br />\nJohns Hopkins, and the Student Affairs<br />\nCommittee made no reference to it. The argument that the University should forego the<br />\npossible application of this sanction in cases<br />\nof extreme misconduct incompatible with the<br />\nacademic enterprise does not seem to me<br />\npersuasive.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee sought<br />\nto justify its position on grounds of the<br />\npossibility of social education and rehabilitation, but this argument implies a false analogy<br />\nbetween society as a whole and the University. The wider society does have a respons-<br />\n<br />\nDean Allyn W. Kimball, who forwarded the President's July<br />\n7 draft on to the Committee on Student Affairs. The committee later substantially rewrote the document.<br />\n<br />\nibility for promoting rehabilitation, but that<br />\nis not a proper function or obligation of the<br />\nUniversity in all cases.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee suggested the possibility of unlimited suspension as<br />\nan equivalent to expulsion, subject to the<br />\nthe right of the student involved to annual<br />\nappeal. This proposal distorts the concept of<br />\nsuspension, which should be for a definite<br />\nperiod. Since the University does not bar<br />\napplication for readmission by an expelled<br />\nstudent, the difference in practice comes<br />\ndown to whether consideration of readmission should be through the ordinary admissions procedures or through the Review<br />\nBoards established under the new Student<br />\nConduct Policy. On the reasonable assumption of some limit on the number of available<br />\nplaces, it does not seem wise to have two<br />\npotentially competing admissions processes or<br />\nto set up an automatic priority for indefinitely suspended former students as against new<br />\napplicants. Since the composition of Review<br />\nBoards will change from case to case and<br />\nfrom year to year, a Board would in the event<br />\nof appeal have to familiarize itself with a case<br />\nin the perhaps distant past. Moreover, the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee has probably underestimated the danger of an annuarappeal<br />\nbeing converted into a distracting sideshow to<br />\nbe exploited for its _publicity potential but<br />\nwithout positive value to the University.<br />\nFinally, the proposal of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee paradoxically appears to<br />\ngive a kind of \"tenure\" to students who have<br />\nnot graduated simply because they were once<br />\nadmitted. Administrative officers have no<br />\ntenure and faculty members receive tenure<br />\nonly after a substantial period of professional<br />\nservice and an elaborate case by case review<br />\nprocedure.<br />\nFor these reasons, the new proposed<br />\ndraft retains the sanction of expulsion. It<br />\nshould go without saying that this sanction<br />\nwould be applied only in cases of the most<br />\nserious violazions of the standards of conduct<br />\n<br />\nset forth in the policy statement.<br />\n4. Composition of Review Boards<br />\nThe ad hoc Committee draft of May 29,<br />\n1969, and the Student Affairs Committee<br />\ndraft of January 5, 1970, proposed that the<br />\nReview Boards be composed of four students,<br />\ntwo members of the faculty, and one administrator. The July 7 draft proposed a membership of five, made uP of two students, two<br />\nfaculty members, and one member of the<br />\nadministration. In my explanatory letter of<br />\nJuly 7, I set forth the position that the<br />\nstandards of conduct are of essential concern to all three full-time components of the<br />\ncommunity (faculty, students, and administration), and that none of these elements should<br />\ntherefore be given a Board majority. I also<br />\nfelt that it would be easier to convene a group<br />\nof five than a group of seven. These proposals<br />\nwere found acceptable by three of our<br />\nacademic divisions.<br />\nAlthough the practice in other universities is not necessarily indicative of what<br />\nJohns Hopkins should do, I thought it helpful<br />\nto collect information on the composition of<br />\ncorresponding Boards from a number of<br />\ncomparable institutions which have recently<br />\nrevised their machinery for quasi-judicial<br />\nprocedures of this type. The results are as<br />\nfollows:<br />\nUniversity of California<br />\nUniversity of Chicago<br />\nCornell University<br />\n<br />\nDuke University<br />\n<br />\nHarvard University<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Hawaii<br />\n<br />\nIndiana University<br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nNew York University<br />\n<br />\nPennsylvania State<br />\nUniversity<br />\nPrinceton University<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Rochester<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin<br />\n<br />\nall faculty<br />\nall faculty and adminstration<br />\nHearing Board of four<br />\nfaculty, four students,<br />\none administrator, two<br />\nnon-faculty staff; Review Board of two<br />\nfaculty, two students,<br />\none administrator<br />\nfive faculty, fourteen<br />\nstudents, with appeal<br />\nto President or Provost<br />\nthree faculty without<br />\nadministrative responsibilities, three faculty<br />\nwith administrative responsibilities, and three<br />\nstudents<br />\ntwo faculty, two students, and one administrator<br />\none student, one faculty, one administrator<br />\nall faculty<br />\none faculty, one student, one chosen jointly by those two<br />\nall faculty<br />\nthree faculty, three students, one administrator, and a chairman appointed by the President<br />\nfive faculty, five students, one administrator<br />\nall faculty<br />\n<br />\nIt will be noted that in this group of<br />\ninstitutions, with the exception of Duke,<br />\nnone of these Boards contains a student<br />\nmajority. The considerations on this point<br />\nset forth by the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs are certainly of weight, but they do<br />\nnot seem to me to be controlling. The refer-<br />\n<br />\n\fFeb. 6, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER SUPPLEMENT<br />\n<br />\nPRESIDENT'S STATEMENT ON DISCIPLINE<br />\n<br />\nUniversity, However, Retains Right to Expel<br />\nence to peer groups would be more pertinent<br />\nto a jury than to a quasi-judicial Board of the<br />\ntype contemplated. The key point insufficiently weighed by the Committee is that, unlike the other types of decisions referred to in<br />\nits explanatory statement, cases that might<br />\narise under the proposed policy statement<br />\nmay affect the vital fabric -- or even the<br />\nsurvival -- of the institution as an effective<br />\nacademic enterprise. For these reasons, I<br />\ncontinue to believe that none of the fulltime segments of the community should be<br />\nrepresented by a majority on the Review<br />\nBoards.<br />\nWhether the membership should be five<br />\nor seven seems to me a minor point. In view<br />\nof the argument set forth by the Committee<br />\non Student Affairs, I have proposed a total of seven, composed of three faculty members,<br />\nthree students, and one administrator.<br />\nThere remains the problem of the method of selection of Review Board members.<br />\nThe July 7 draft proposed that the administration member be appointed by the Dean concerned and the faculty and student members<br />\nbe chosen by lot from membership pools<br />\ninitially selected by appropriate representative processes within each division. The Chairman was also to be selected by lot. The Committee on Student Affairs proposed a selection<br />\nby lot from all the full-time members of the<br />\nthree respective groups, with the Chairman to<br />\nbe chosen by a vote of the Board itself.<br />\nThis proposal raises problems of a strictly practical character. The faculty numbers<br />\nmore than three hundred in each of the three<br />\nBaltimore academic divisions, and the student<br />\nbodies range from three hundred to over three<br />\nthousand in the case of the Division of Arts<br />\nand Sciences. If a workable ad hoc Review<br />\nBoard is to be constituted quickly, especially<br />\nin emergency cases, it would appear essential<br />\nto arrange for the prior constitution of pools<br />\nof persons who would know that they might<br />\nbe called on for service on a Review Board<br />\nand would feel themselves willing and able to<br />\n<br />\nperform such service. Arrangements could also<br />\nbe made to acquaint the members of these<br />\npools with pertinent procedures and legal<br />\ndecisions bearing on this responsibility.<br />\nFor these reasons, the new proposed<br />\ndraft provides for the constitution of membership pools by random selection from<br />\nappropriate stratified groups of the respective<br />\nfull memberships. A supplementary statement<br />\nwould be prepared for each division setting<br />\nforth the details of this selection process.<br />\nIn the case of the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences, where the largest numbers are involved, it is contemplated that the faculty<br />\npool might number thirty-five, selected on a<br />\ndepartmental basis with two members each<br />\nfrom the nineteen smaller departments. The<br />\ngraduate student pool could be constituted in<br />\nthe same way and in the same numbers. For<br />\nundergraduates, nine representatives of each<br />\nclass.could be selected at the beginning of the<br />\nacademic year, making a total of thirty-six.<br />\nThe number of administration members is<br />\nsufficiently small to make unnecessary any<br />\npreselection of a pool. The initial random<br />\nselection process would include the drawing<br />\nof alternate names, who could replace in the<br />\npool those members initially selected who felt<br />\nthemselves unable or unwilling to serve.<br />\nThe proposal that the Chairman be<br />\nselected by the Board itself appears sound and<br />\nhas been incorporated in the new draft. I<br />\nhave also added a sentence in Section II, paragraph 1, providing for assistance on procedural<br />\nmatters by University counsel if a Review<br />\nBoard so desires.<br />\n5. Open and Closed Hearings<br />\n<br />\nThe drafts of May 29 and July 7 were<br />\nsilent on this question. The Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs proposed that all Review<br />\nBoard hearings be public unless the student<br />\nconcerned requests. a closed hearing. Experience elsewhere suggests that his proposal is<br />\nunwise, since it might invite disruptive tactics<br />\nmaking it impossible for the Review Boards<br />\nto function effectively. For this reason, the<br />\nnew draft permits the Review Boards themselves to determine whether the hearings shall<br />\nbe open or closed, but makes them closed in<br />\nany event if the student so requests.<br />\n6. Weight of Decisions by Review Boards<br />\n<br />\nWilliam Bevan, Vice-President and Provost of the University.<br />\nAlthough not mentioned in the statement, he has received<br />\npraise from everyone concerned for his help in its formulation.<br />\n<br />\nOn this point, the May 29 draft was<br />\nsilent, whereas the July 7 draft and the proposal of the Committee on Student Affairs<br />\nboth explicitly recognized the ultimate legal<br />\nauthority-of the Board of Trustees and of the<br />\nPresident, with respect to student conduct.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee draft, however, then stated that \"it is to be expected,<br />\nhowever, that decisions of the Review Boards..<br />\nwould be carried out,\" whereas the July 7<br />\ndraft added the clause \"unless there were<br />\nextraordinary and compelling reasons' for a<br />\ndiffering action on the part of the final<br />\nconstituted authorities.\"<br />\nWhile the Student Affairs Committee<br />\nis of course entitled to express its own expectation, an endorsement by me of the language proposed by that Committee might be<br />\n\"construed as an unqualified delegation of<br />\n<br />\nDr. John White, Chairman of the Student Affairs Committee.<br />\nToday's draft from the President's office incorporates much<br />\nof the committee's work of the past months.<br />\n<br />\npower which would be inconsistent with the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee's own statement<br />\nelsewhere in its explanatory statement that<br />\nthe administration would hold \"the final<br />\n,power of veto over its decisions.\" All versions<br />\nof the proposed new policy already constitute<br />\na large delegation of authority in relation to<br />\nthe present situation. The new policy is necessarily experimental in character, and it is my<br />\nearnest hope that it will not have to be put to<br />\nthe test of extreme circumstances. Should that<br />\noccur, however, it would not appear wise to<br />\nwaive entirely the possibility of a final review<br />\nat presidential or Trustee level. Such a review<br />\nmight, as I pointed out in my letter of July 7,<br />\nresult in a modification of a Review Board decision in either direction, i.e., toward greater<br />\nleniency as well as greater severity. In an<br />\nextremely critical case, the version proposed<br />\nby the Student Affairs Committee would<br />\nleave the President and Trustees no option<br />\nbut to revoke the entire policy statement, an<br />\nact which might gravely intensify an already<br />\nprofound institutional crisis.<br />\nFor these reasons, the language in the<br />\nnew proposed statement incorporates the<br />\nadditional language of the July 7 draft.<br />\n****<br />\nThere remains the question of appropriate procedures for the formal adoption of the<br />\nproposed policy. Since this is a universitywide matter, the new draft is being circulated<br />\nto all full-time segments of all the academic<br />\ndivisions.<br />\nIf a petition for a specific amendment,<br />\naccompanied by a statement of supporting<br />\nreasons, is endorsed by one-fourth or more of<br />\nthe fulltime student or faculty body in any<br />\ndivision prior to March 31, 1970, I will give<br />\nserious consideration to that proposal in<br />\nconsultation with representatives of the<br />\ngroup concerned.

Amendments to the present<br />\npolicy statement on student conduct would<br />\nfall in that category. Meanwhile, the proposal<br />\nattached herewith constitutes a very substan-<br />\n<br />\nmulgation before the end of the current<br />\nacademic year.<br />\nAs the extensive labors on this matter<br />\nduring the last eighteen months make clear,<br />\nit would be foolish to suppose that any statement would win the unanimous support of all<br />\nthe members of the community. Nor is any<br />\nstatement forever closed to future amendment<br />\nin the light of experience. We are in the early<br />\nPROPOSED POLICY STATEMENT<br />\nON STUDENT CONDUCT<br />\n(Draft of January 26, 1970)<br />\nI. Introduction<br />\nTo attempt to define rules of conduct in<br />\nterms of specific forms of misconduct is to<br />\nrisk omissions and to provoke a series of<br />\nafter-the-fact amendments that weaken the<br />\nforce of the original policy statement. Rather,<br />\nit is preferable that such rules be stated in<br />\nterms of the general characteristics which<br />\nidentify such classes of behavior, and that<br />\nfair procedural arrangements provide for their<br />\napplication to specific cases. The University's<br />\nmethods should be those of rational inquiry<br />\nand dialogue. Thus, the application of behavioral sanctions to its students is an inherently distasteful process. However, traditional<br />\ndependence on self-discipline by members of<br />\nthe academic community does not in fact<br />\nalways prevent actions prejudicial to the rights<br />\nof others. Every university is therefore compelled to seek policies and procedures that<br />\nensure its integrity as a social institution. In<br />\ndoing so, however, it must be mindful of the<br />\ninterests and rights of its members, must uphold the right of free speech, and must not<br />\nbetray its humane tradition.<br />\n<br />\nII. The Sanctions of Suspension or Expulsion<br />\nThe sanctions of suspension or expulsion<br />\nmay be recommended by the chief administrative officer of the Division or his designated<br />\nrepresentative but the sanction shall be applied only on the basis of a hearing for the<br />\nstudent charged with misconduct by an ad hoc<br />\nReview Board composed of fellow students<br />\nand members of the faculty and administration. The hearing shall be conducted in<br />\nconformity with the following principles.<br />\n1. A Review Board shall be constituted<br />\nwhen needed and shall consist of three<br />\nstudents, three faculty members, and one<br />\nadministrator. A Review Board may call<br />\non University counsel for assistance in<br />\nprocedural matters. Members shall be<br />\nselected by random drawing from membership pools constituted at the beginning of each academic year and composed of full-time members of the above<br />\nmentioned groups. In any case where<br />\ntotal membership of a group exceeds 35<br />\nin number, a membership pool will be<br />\nconstituted through random selection<br />\nfrom appropriate groups (departments,<br />\nclasses, etc.), with the specific arrangements set forth in a supplementary statement of procedure for each academic<br />\ndivision. The chairman of the Board shall<br />\nbe chosen by a vote of the Board.<br />\n2. A Review Board shall have the power<br />\nto confirm the recommended sanction,<br />\nto impose a more severe or lesser sanction, or to exonerate the student charged<br />\nwith misconduct.<br />\n3. The student shall be notified in writing of the charge against him, of the recommended sanction, and of the time<br />\nand place of the hearing. Every effort<br />\nshall be made to make contact with the<br />\nstudent, including the sending of a<br />\nregistered letter to the student's last address, as given by the student to the<br />\nUniversity. The- sending of this letter<br />\nshall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of notification.<br />\n4. Both the Review Board and the student may call and cross-examine wit_<br />\nnesses of their choice.<br />\n5. The student may select someone to<br />\n<br />\nThe broad class of behavior which may<br />\nbe subject to appropriate sanctions consists of<br />\nconduct that abridges the rights of other<br />\nindividuals or groups, especially as it affects<br />\nthe educational goals of those within the<br />\nUniversity community, or threatens their<br />\nsafety, health, or property, or conduct that<br />\nimpairs the effective functioning of the University or causes damage to its physical facilities.<br />\nThe University will not intrude itself into the personal lives of its students nor will it<br />\nadd sanctions for unlawful behavior already<br />\ndealt with by civil authority, unless such<br />\nbehavior falls within the class of conduct<br />\ndescribed above. It is understood that sanctions are to be rationally applied and commensurate with the seriousness of the precipitating misconduct. The presence of any<br />\nextenuating circumstances will also be weighed before imposition of University sanctions.<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n4i7tt<br />\nMembers of the<br />\n<br />\nCommittee on Student Affairs at<br />\nThe committee represented the only group which<br />\nisfaction ,y/j,th, the,j,Prpsi4e,nt.'sJuly 7 conduct daft.Wednesday's\u2022meeting.<br />\n.. .expressed<br />\n\u201e<br />\n. . dissqt\u2022\u2022<br />\n-\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n--\u2022\u2022\u2022 - \u2022 -<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 -<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 '<br />\n<br />\ntial advance over the preexisting status of a<br />\nformal policy vacuum.

The Review Board will determine whether hearings should be open or closed,<br />\nbut they will be closed if so requested by the student. Whether hearings<br />\nare open or closed, the Board shall<br />\nretire to reach its decision. The<br />\nBoard shall then make a public<br />\nstatement of the decision reached and the<br />\nsanction imposed, if any. If the Board<br />\ndeems it appropriate it may also make a<br />\nstatement of the reasons underlying its<br />\ndecision. A record of these statements<br />\nshall be kept.<br />\n7. Records of closed proceedings shall be<br />\nconfidential and may be divulged only<br />\nwith the student's written permission.<br />\nThey shall be destroyed upon his graduation or within four years after his departure from the University, whichever<br />\ncomes first.<br />\n8. A Review Board shall always meet<br />\nwithin five working days of the recommendation of a sanction.<br />\n9. In cases of emergency where the recommendation of suspension of expulsion is involved, and upon request of the<br />\nprincipal administrative officer of the<br />\nDivision or his designated representative,<br />\nthe Review Board will be called to meet<br />\nnot later than the next day, and the<br />\nstudent will be informed of this decision.<br />\n10. If the administration declines to act<br />\non an allegation of misconduct made by<br />\nany member of the University, the complainant may request the constitution of<br />\na Review Board for a hearing.<br />\nIII. Other Sanctions<br />\nSanctions other than suspension or expulsion may be imposed by the principal<br />\nadministrative officer, or his designated representative, without mandatory Review Board<br />\nconsideration. However, any student upon<br />\nwhom such a sanction has been imposed may,<br />\nwithin two academic days following due<br />\nnotice of the sanction and of his right of<br />\nappeal, request in writing to the principal<br />\nadministrative officer or his designated representative that his case be reviewed. In this<br />\nevent a Review Board will be convened within<br />\nfive working days of the receipt of the student's appeal from the sanction. The principles described above for conduct of hearings<br />\nby Review Boards shall be followed.<br />\nIV. Weight of Decisions by Review Board<br />\nThe ultimate legal authority of the Board<br />\nof Trustees and of the President with respect<br />\nfo student conduct is recognized. It is to be<br />\nexpected, however, that decisions of the<br />\nReview Boards established pursuant to this<br />\npolicy statement would be carried out unless<br />\nthere were extraordinary and compelling reasons for a differing action on the part of the<br />\nalethaities*. \u2014<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 6, 1970<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nfeaturesium.<br />\nBruce,Corgell: Super Supergroup<br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nThe much-publicized demise of Cream<br />\nled to the much-publicized birth of BlindFaith, the first of the million dollar<br />\nsupergroups and the biggest musical disappointment of last year.

Some of Coryell's riffs<br />\nwere reminiscent of \"Stiff Neck\" on<br />\nLADY CORYELL; maybe that was the<br />\nsong. Coryell's start-at-the-top-andplay-every-goddamn-note-on-the-waydown riffs are never less than intrigenjoyable. Unfortunately,<br />\nand<br />\nuing<br />\nBruce and Coryell were not as close on<br />\nthis song as on the others.<br />\n\"The Clearout\", from SONGS FOR A<br />\nTAILOR, was the next piece, beginning<br />\nwith Mitchell's vicious thrashing and<br />\nfading out with soft organ notes. In<br />\nbetween, Bruce and Coryell: what more<br />\ncan I say?<br />\nThe 45-minute set (much much too<br />\nshort) concluded with \"Sunshine of Your<br />\nLove\". perhaps Cream's most famous<br />\nsong (music by Bruce and Eric Clapton,<br />\nwords by Pete Brown.) The primitive<br />\nbeat came from the small stage like a<br />\nvolcano, reinforced by heavy organ<br />\nchords. This time, Bruce sang all the<br />\nwords. I was very surprised that Bruce<br />\nwould do this song and \"Politician\",<br />\nconsidering the numerous derogatory remarks he has made in interviews about<br />\nthe quality of Cream's music. But that's<br />\nnot very important.<br />\nWell, was it jazzy or was it rock?

Though he does so now more from<br />\nself-concern than any other actor, he is<br />\nbeginning to realize the implications of<br />\nhis acts both for himself and the rest of<br />\nthe living world as well.<br />\nIn America, this attitude has been a<br />\nlong time in coming. Unlike European<br />\ncountries, the United States had frontiers<br />\nand unexplored regions when the industrial age began to gather momentum.<br />\nThe settlers of those days worked the<br />\nsoil and when it stopped being productive<br />\nhad only to move to a new wilderness.<br />\nFew at that time were cognizant of the<br />\nfact that the frontier would end one day<br />\n<br />\nand the resources dwindle.

For the production of<br />\ntheir needs, factories manufacture an<br />\nendless array of consumer goods. They<br />\nalso produce unwanted things in vast<br />\nquantities; smoke, sewage, noise,detergents, poison and atomic heat.Lake Erie<br />\nis now a completely dead body of water.<br />\nManufacturing plants which dumped their<br />\nwaste into it during the last decades have<br />\nmade it uninhabitable to all forms oflife<br />\nexcept a species of carp fish that has<br />\nadapted to a diet of poison.<br />\nShips sailing the mid-Atlantic area,<br />\n<br />\nhundreds of miles from oil derricks or<br />\nrefineries, have often had to stop to clean<br />\noil from nets and equipment. Worse however is the fact that millions of tons of<br />\noil which are dumped into the ocean are<br />\ndestroying the plant life which many feel<br />\nIs the earth's last source of food.<br />\nThe natural environment does not encompass the water, air and land only. It<br />\nIncludes the creatures that live in those<br />\nenvironments. The major problem in<br />\nmaking the general public understand the<br />\nterm \"eco-sytem\" is the difficulty of<br />\nmerely comprehending the dependency of<br />\nvarious life forms on one another. The<br />\npoisoning or eliminating of one species of<br />\nplant or animal can have an incalculable<br />\neffect on countless others.<br />\n(continued on page 11)<br />\n<br />\n(continued from page 8)<br />\nlish things through the \"proper channels.\"<br />\nThe hypocrisy is too clear to stomach.<br />\nEveryone says one thing, but Lincoln does<br />\nanother.

The<br />\nlast strike, at the beginning of 1966, resulted in only a 22 day stoppage.<br />\nAlthough the contracts of three different locals expired on December 31, only<br />\none of the three, Local 31 of the Web<br />\nPressman's Union, voted to go on strike.<br />\nThe other two groups, the mailers and<br />\nthe printers, immediately supported the<br />\n, action although they are not officially on<br />\nstrike. Also backing the strikers is the<br />\nreporters' guild, as well as other newspaper -oriented unions.<br />\n<br />\nThe fact that the\u2022 strike actually occurred came as somewhat of a surprise<br />\nto the public, as little indication had been<br />\ngiven by either side that an impasse was<br />\ndeveloping. Furthermore, sources at the<br />\nSun indicated that they had not anticipated that the Web Pressmenwould hold fast<br />\nto a \"No Contract--No Work' position.<br />\nIn the past, many contract disputes have<br />\nbeen resolved after the expiration deadline has passed.<br />\nUnofficial sources indicated that the<br />\nPressmen's Union is presently in the<br />\nthroes of an internal power struggle<br />\nbetween the older leaders and a group<br />\nof more radical dissidents. Ostensibly,<br />\nthe outcome of this battle will have an<br />\neffect upon the duration of the strike.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the proceedings, including<br />\ntime and place of the labor-management discussions, are cloaked in secrecy, the issues at hand seem to involve<br />\nboth wages and operational procedure.<br />\nThe union apparently is demanding pay<br />\nscale parity with that of Washington<br />\npressmen.<br />\nThe pressmen in Washington negotiated a new two-year contract last October<br />\nwhich provided for atop minimum salary<br />\nof just over $200 weekly. Baltimore's<br />\npresent equivalent to that is $164. Other<br />\nissues separating the pressmen and the<br />\nBaltimore publishers include union de-<br />\n<br />\nmands that the papers increase management conributions to a health and accident fund and that management agree to<br />\na two-year contract rather than the three<br />\nyear contract which was originally offered.<br />\nThe most significant issue at the moment, however, and the one which appears<br />\nto be holding up all other discussion, revolves around the question of operation-or 'manning', in newspaper jargon.<br />\nManning refers to the number of<br />\npressmen needed on any given day, a<br />\nnumber which is dependant upon the size<br />\nof the newspaper being run on that day.<br />\nBecause of fairly significant fluctations<br />\nin news content, particularly onSundays,<br />\nthe manning situation results in a great<br />\ndeal of uncertainty for the junior press-<br />\n<br />\nment, who are the first to be laid off in<br />\nslack times and the last to be called up<br />\non good days.<br />\nTHORNY PAST<br />\n<br />\npapers. A high official of the Sun said<br />\nof the demand; \"Featherbedding, that's<br />\nwhat it is.\" Union officials refused to<br />\ncomment on the charge.<br />\n<br />\nThe manning question has been a thorny<br />\nproblem in the past and last year the matter was put up for arbitration. The thenbinding decision came out in favor of<br />\nmanagement, and the union has apparently been seething ever since. In the negotiations it has demanded that a fixed<br />\nnumber of pressmen be permanently<br />\nemployed.<br />\nThe publishers claim that this would<br />\nresult in an intolerable situation for them,<br />\ncausing men to be idle on slow days and<br />\nforcing the short-term (and hence, expensive) hiring of extras for fuller<br />\n<br />\nBoth sides implicity acknowledged that<br />\nother considerations are lurking in the<br />\nbackround, too. Although the printers<br />\nand the mailers are not actually on strike,<br />\nthe contract deadlines of four other unions are up for renogotiation in the coming months. These include the stereotypers in March, the photo-engravers<br />\nin April, the reporters in June and the<br />\nteamsters in July. It is clear that any<br />\nsettlement that is reached with the<br />\nstrikers will have a major effect on<br />\nfuture negotiations.<br />\n<br />\n(continued on page 15)<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Connects Estrogen To Cancer<br />\nAs Controversy Over 'The Pill' Grows<br />\nFor years the Food an Drug Administration has been telling 8,500,000 women<br />\nwho take oral contraceptives that \"the<br />\npill\" is an extremely safe and efficient<br />\nmethod of birth control despite growing<br />\nevidence that the birth control pill may<br />\nhave very dangerous side effects.<br />\nThe dangers of the pill were brought<br />\nout into the open during a recent Senate<br />\nhearing at which Dr. Hugh J. Davis,<br />\nassistant professor in Obstetrics and<br />\nGyncecology<br />\nat the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, was the first speaker. Evidence<br />\nwas presented stating that the pill may<br />\ncause blindness or blurred vision, migraine headaches,liver malfunction, pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lung)<br />\nand breast cancer.<br />\nFour days after the hearing, the FDA<br />\nreversed its position and mailed letters<br />\nto 30,000 doctors, which were predated<br />\ntwo days before the hearing. The letter<br />\nspecifically warned of the dangers of<br />\nthrombophlebitis (blood clot in the leg)<br />\nand pulmonary embolism resulting from<br />\nthe use of the pill. Studies were cited<br />\nshowing that women taking the birth control pill have a four to seven times great-<br />\n<br />\ner risk of these disorders than nonusers.<br />\n<br />\nThere is other evidence linking estrogen to breast cancer. Males who have high<br />\nlevels of estrogen, such as transsexuals,<br />\nhave a higher incidence of breast cancer.<br />\n<br />\nEstrogen Content<br />\nThere are two types of pills available<br />\nin the U.S.: combination pills in which a<br />\nsynthetic progesterone is given with a<br />\nsmall dose of synthetic estrogen for 21<br />\nstraight days; and sequential pills in<br />\nwhich estrogen alone is given for 14 - 16<br />\ndays and then a combination pill is given<br />\nfor the rest of the cycle. There is some<br />\nevidence that the higher estrogen level<br />\nfound is sequential pills more frequently<br />\ncauses a thrombus formation than the<br />\ncombination pills.<br />\nIt is the estrogen in the pill which has<br />\nbeen connected with cancer. Estrogen<br />\nlevels several times greater than that in<br />\nthe pill when given to five different species of mammals have caused the development of breast tumors. The FDA feels<br />\nthat this does not indicate proof of any<br />\ndanger to women from the pill. Dr. Davis<br />\nhas pointed out that when five disparate<br />\nmammalian species are already shown to<br />\nbe susceptible to a drug,then the chances<br />\nof another species being susceptible if<br />\nyou give the drug long enough are very<br />\ngood.<br />\n<br />\nNo Warnings<br />\nPerhaps the most insidious effect of the<br />\nFDA's old attitude toward the pill is that<br />\nfew users have known that there was<br />\npossibility of danger involved. There are<br />\nno warnings on the prescription medications, and doctors do not tell their<br />\npatients of the side effects. A recent<br />\nGallup poll showed that 80% of women<br />\nwho use birth control pills said that no<br />\none had told them about the possible dangers involved.<br />\nThere is one danger of the pill which<br />\neven Hopkins undergraduates have to be<br />\nconcerned with. The increase in the use<br />\nof the pill has caused a decrease in the<br />\nuse of condoms, thus leading to a rise<br />\ninthe incidence of venereal disease.<br />\nThe pill is supposed to be 100% effective<br />\nin preventing pregnancy. The artificial<br />\nhormones in the pill supress the body's<br />\nproduction of the pituitary gonadotrophins (sex gland stimulating hormones)<br />\nwhich cause ovulation.<br />\n<br />\n(continued on page 15)<br />\n<br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nCLEANERS<br />\n<br />\nART GALLERY<br />\n<br />\nComplete Bachelor Service<br />\n<br />\nPortraits, Paintings, Framing<br />\n<br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n467-2123<br />\n<br />\nGALLERY G, Ltd.<br />\n710 Reisterstown Rd.<br />\nPikesville 484-7171<br />\n<br />\nST.

He refus-<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n\u201c:,it.h..r\u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\ned to elaborate.<br />\nMeanwhile, the strike is causing reporters at one of the two<br />\npapers a considerable<br />\naffected<br />\n,<br />\narnotint of hardship. Whereas<br />\n\"Hearst's News-American has<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nMembers of the striking Web Pressman's Union in front of the Sunpapers<br />\noffice on Calvert Street.<br />\n<br />\nofficially laid off all members<br />\nof the company's ownNews Union<br />\n<br />\nOther Devices Found Imperfect<br />\n(continued from page 14)<br />\nHowever, every year, 40 - 50% of the women who<br />\nare taking the pill stop using it for reasons such<br />\nreasons such as cramps, headaches, weight gain,<br />\nloss of libido, or desire to have a child. Of these<br />\nwomen, 80% become pregnant. \"Perhaps it would<br />\nbe more accurate to say that the failure rate of<br />\nthe pill as a sterility measure is closer to 40%<br />\nsaid Dr. Davis.<br />\nAlthough the obvious best form of birth control<br />\nIs abstinance, most couples view this methodwith<br />\ndistaste. With the ever widening availability and<br />\nuse of other contraceptive methods, both men and<br />\nwomen are finding and demanding a greater happiness in sexual relations correlating to the decreasing fear of pregnancy.<br />\nVaginal Inserts<br />\nFor those women who cannot tolerate the pill,<br />\nor who fear side effects from its use, there is<br />\nno other \"perfect\" method of birth control. The<br />\nintrauterine device (IUD), a small ring or spiral<br />\nshaped object inserted into the uterus by a physician, is claimed to be 95% effective. The exact<br />\nway in which the IUK acts is not known, although<br />\nIt is believed to speed the descent of the egg so<br />\nthat the sperm cannot fertilize it, or the egg may<br />\nreach the uterus at a time when it cannot nest<br />\nthere. Dr. Davis, a specialist in the study of IUD's<br />\nstated that \"about 5% of women who request<br />\nthis method cannot adapt due to bleeding, discomfort, and cramping.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe major fear of the woman who uses the<br />\nIUD and very definitely wishes to avoid pregnancy is that in 5 - 10% of IUD users?ftie device<br />\nmay be spontaneoulsy expelled. If the women is<br />\nobservant and finds it before having relations,then<br />\nit may be reinserted by the doctor and pregnancy<br />\navoided. IUD's are available for young women<br />\nWho have already had a child. Because the IUD<br />\nrequires little motivation'on the part of either<br />\n<br />\npartner, it has found wide approval by Family<br />\nPlanning Clinics operating in inner-city areas.<br />\n<br />\nSperm Prevention<br />\nOther types of contraceptive measures work on<br />\nthe principle of preventing sperm from entering<br />\ninto the uterus. The traditional condom offers<br />\na high degree of protection when used correctly<br />\nand consistently. Failures are due to tearing of<br />\nthe sheath or slipping off after climax. The condom does have some disadvantages; both women<br />\nand men complain of some interference with sensation, hinderance in spontaneity of sexual relations and with the male inability to maintain<br />\nan erection while the condom is being applied.<br />\n<br />\nthus making them eligible for unemployment insurance, the Sunpapers reporters are still employed and can theoretically collect their paychecks if they cross<br />\nthe picket lines. Few are doing so.<br />\nThe Reporter's Guild benefits<br />\ntotal only $35 per week.<br />\nThe Evening Sun stated that a<br />\nnumber of its reporters have resigned since the strike began.<br />\nOhters have managed to find temporary employment elsewhere.<br />\nThe Social Security Administra-<br />\n<br />\ntion in Woodlawn has hired -at<br />\nleast 16 to fill temporary jobs<br />\nin the administration's press office.<br />\nTen other reporters have become television news cornmentators for the duration of the strike<br />\non Baltimore's UHF station,<br />\nWMPB, Channel 67. At least five<br />\nmore are working for Advertising Design Associates, a printer<br />\nwho is attempting to fill the newspaper vacuum by putting out a<br />\ndaily tabloid, the Baltimore Daily,<br />\n<br />\nEngineers:<br />\nJoin the<br />\ndiversified world<br />\nof Martin Marietta<br />\n<br />\nThe femal version of the condom is the diaphragm, a hemispherical rubber dome inserted<br />\ninto the vagina before intercourse,thus providing a<br />\nbarrier to sperm. Reports indicate an up to 14%<br />\nfailure rate, although according to Dr. Davis<br />\nfailures result not from any defect in the diaphragm, but because the women failed to use it<br />\nwhen having relations.<br />\nChemical methods of contraception in the form<br />\nof creams. jellys, tablets, and foams act to coat<br />\nvaginal surfaces, destroy sperm cells and provide a mechanical barrier. Protection is maintained for about one hour although the rate of<br />\neffectiveness is substantially lower than the aforementioned types of birth control methods.<br />\nThe only birth control measure approved by<br />\nthe Roman,Catholic church is th \"rhythm method.\"<br />\nWhen using this method, success depends solely<br />\nupon abstinance from intercourse during the time<br />\nof the month when the female partner is fertile, a<br />\nperiod which may last up to 15 days.

To date, the<br />\ncenter is running on a large deficit despite the availability of a $207,000 federal grant. Dr. Wurmser explained that<br />\nthe grant requires matching funds from<br />\neither state, city, or private sources;<br />\nSince these funds have not materialized, only $130,000 of the grant has been<br />\nutilized.<br />\nOne of the major reaons why the 200<br />\npatient center has suffered financially is<br />\nthe disinterest shown by Baltimore.<br />\nThough most of the addicts are from<br />\nthe city, Baltimore has contributed<br />\nneither funds nor support to the center.<br />\n<br />\nThe Only One<br />\nThe Drug Abuse Center is the only<br />\none of its kind in the Baltimore area.<br />\nThe older Project Adapt and Man Alive<br />\norganizations were established as maintenance clinics where heroin addicts<br />\ncould come and receive free treatment<br />\nand narcotics substitutes. The Drug<br />\nAbuse Center, however, is attempting<br />\nnot only maintenance of the drug addict<br />\nbut also the long-range posibility of complete detoxification.<br />\nBecause the center supports only one<br />\nfull-time and four part-time physicians,<br />\nthe waiting-list for care at the center<br />\nis long, and, due to this need for selectivity<br />\nof patients, uncooperative or<br />\ntroublesome addicts must seek other<br />\nalternatives. Of prime importance to the<br />\nfunctioning of this program is the sin-<br />\n<br />\ncerity and motivation of the addict himself. It is up to the addict to return<br />\npromptly for daily medication and weekly<br />\ncounseling sessions.<br />\nMany addicts are, however, pressured<br />\neither by family, probation officers or the<br />\ncourts to attend the center, according to<br />\nits staff members. Unfortunately, such<br />\npressures hardly insure that the addict<br />\nhas any desire to quit and many such<br />\npatients require constant supervision,<br />\nwhich the center is unable to provide.<br />\n10,000 Baltimore Addicts<br />\nBecause the center has such limited<br />\ncapabilities and only handles a small<br />\npercentage of the city's 10,000 addicts,<br />\nit is forced to treat only the most hopeful and thus utilize its resources to the<br />\nfullest. In treating heroin and cocaine<br />\naddicts, the center uses an artificial<br />\nnarcotic substance called methadone.<br />\nThe heart of the methadone treatment<br />\nis that the patient becomes addicted to it<br />\ninstead of heroin. Methadone has none<br />\nof the withdraw al and vomiting symptoms<br />\nthat accompany heroin, and, most importantly, prevents the 'up' sensation.<br />\nHeroin also has a cummulative affect,<br />\nso that the demand for it in the system<br />\nincreases with use. Methadone, however,<br />\nis able to maintain the present addiction<br />\nlevel without further development.<br />\nJane Carbary, one of the three fulltime nurses at the center, related some<br />\nof the problems that arise with methadone and the addict. She explained that<br />\nthe dosage of methadone depends upon<br />\nthe extent of present addiction; consequently, medication is based on the<br />\naddict's assessment of his own situation. Most addicts don't display such<br />\ncooperative tendencies, so much of the<br />\ncenter's work is hindered and many<br />\n<br />\naddicts drop out after a few days.<br />\nAmong the other problems the center<br />\nhandles is that of maintaining an addict.<br />\nA large segment of the center's patients<br />\nhave neither the strength nor the will to<br />\nquit their present rate of addiction. The<br />\ncenter is then forced to maintain them<br />\non methadone indefinitely, perhaps even<br />\nfor life. Nevertheless, this is still more<br />\ndesirable than abandoning the addict, because maintenance keeps the patient in<br />\ncontact with the center so that he is no<br />\nlonger forced to steal to satisfy his needs.<br />\nMaintenance also allows the center to<br />\nmonitor the addict's progress and, hopefully, to motivate him to quit at a later<br />\ndate.<br />\n<br />\nMethadone Addiction<br />\nMiss Carbary also detailed the progress of an addict who wishes to kick<br />\nthe habit. If the desire to quite is genuine,<br />\nthe addict then accepts less and less<br />\nmethadone over a period of time relative<br />\nto his capabilities. So far, however,only<br />\none addict has been completely detoxified<br />\nat the center.<br />\nAddicts, in addition to maintenance or<br />\ndeclining addiction treatment, receive<br />\ncounseling and job placement, but the<br />\ncritical shortage of volunteers to aid in<br />\nthese activities has kept the center limited in scope. As of now,only addictive drug<br />\nabusers are treated at the center.Abusers of lesser drugs such as grass, hash<br />\nor acid receive only marginal advisory<br />\naid.<br />\n<br />\nEducational Efforts<br />\nThe Drug Abuse Center has also been<br />\nrunning programs to contact and inform<br />\ngroups around the city. Film series,<br />\nlectures and panel discussions are fea-<br />\n<br />\nPETti40ONE<br />\n<br />\nto WG<br />\nalre<br />\nCNAfiniCNT<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe Drug Abuse Clinic in East Baltimore addicts the patient to methadone<br />\ninstead of heroin.<br />\ntured at high schools and other community centers. Such education is also<br />\na regular part of the addict's treatment.<br />\nDespite the center's efforts, the prospects for the future are not good. The<br />\ncenter is understaffed, under-funded and<br />\nignored by the city. The methadone treatment has its good points, but it only prolongs the problem rather than cure it.<br />\nThere are no plans to expand, although<br />\naddicts must constantly be returned to<br />\nthe streets because of shortages.<br />\nOne of the problems noted by the center<br />\nis its frequent use by addicts as a temporary source of maintenance until they<br />\ncan return safely to the streets and back<br />\nto harder narcotics. Financially,there is<br />\nlittle new developing for the center. Even<br />\nthe hoped for Sklar-Mendel Act, presently before the Maryland State Legislature would not benefit the program;<br />\nthe act calls for limited funding of state<br />\ninstitutions and the center does not qualify in this respect.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nBiggest Bust<br />\nStudents at the University of Denver are recovering<br />\nfrom a drug bust which took place there in late January.<br />\nA nighItime raid by Denver police on four dormitories<br />\nand eight off-campus housing units resulted in the arrest<br />\nof 42 students, the most ever arrested in a campus bust.<br />\nIt surpasses the State University of New York at Stony<br />\nBrook raid of 1968 in which 28 were arrested.<br />\nStudents at U. of Denver reacted to the incident by<br />\nproviding four thousand dollars in student fees to help<br />\nmeet bail costs of those arrested. Between 1,0001,500 students gathered at the union building, the jail,<br />\nand then the state capitol to protest the action.<br />\nA principal complaint by students involved the use of<br />\nthree \"mod\" police agents who posed as students to<br />\nobtain information. A University official confirmed that<br />\npolice had been engaged in such activities for a month,<br />\nbut claimed the administration had no part in it.<br />\nThe officials defended the police as having properly<br />\nexercised their duties, and the Chancellor implied that<br />\nthe raid served some good by arresting 19 people on<br />\ncharges of selling drugs. They, he felt, are the real<br />\nculprits.<br />\n<br />\nExpect Long War<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\nThe North Vietnamese people have been warned by<br />\ntheir leaders to be prepared to continue the fight against<br />\nthe U.S. for many more years.<br />\nLe Duan, First Secretary of the Communist Party,<br />\nuttered the warning during the keynote speech he delivered this week at ceremonies marking the 40th Anniversary<br />\nof the founding of the party. He is believed by some to<br />\nbe emerging as the dominant figure in North Vietnamese<br />\npolitics.<br />\nWhile Duan declared his country's desire for peace,<br />\nhe made clear that it must involve \"independence and<br />\nfreedom.\" He blamed the continuing war on U.S. unwillingness to recognize the rights of the Vietnamese<br />\npeople and criticized President Nixon's statements concerning peace as attempts to mislead world opinion.<br />\nOnly when the U.S. has withdrawn all its forces and<br />\nrespects the boundaries of Vietnam, Duan said, can peace<br />\nbe achieved. Until then the North Vietnamese will<br />\ncontinue to assume the burdens of war.<br />\nAmerican analysts viewed Duan's statement as a<br />\nfurther indication of Communist inflexibility for a war<br />\nsettlement. It confirmed their suspicious that North<br />\nVietnamese policy had hardened since the death of Ho<br />\nChi Minh.<br />\n<br />\nAntiwar Meeting<br />\nHigh school and college students involved in the antiwar movement will meet next weekend at Case Western<br />\nReserve University in Cleveland to discuss future plans.<br />\nThe Student Mobilization Committee, which will sponsor the two day conference, predicts it will be the largest<br />\nand most representative gathering of students yet held.<br />\nWorking with the New Mobilization Committee to End<br />\nthe War, the Mob played a large role in organizing the<br />\nOctober 15 Moratorium and the November 15 Marches<br />\non Washington and San Francisco.<br />\nDespite the popular support that Nixon Administration claims exists for its Vietnam policy, the Mob still<br />\nbelieves that the U.S. can be persuaded to withdraw all<br />\nits forces immediately, if the masses of citizens can be<br />\nmobilized effectively into action against the war.<br />\nA primary purpose of the meeting will be to alter<br />\nstrategy in the spring to comply with what appears to<br />\nbe the mood of the nation. This would indicate less<br />\nemphasis to be placed on large scale demonstrations<br />\nand more effort to organize and educate at local levels<br />\nin order to reach the \"Silent Americans.\"<br />\nIn addition to a large contingent of high school students<br />\nexpected to attend, adult peace groups have been invited<br />\nto send observers to further increase the representatives<br />\nof the conference.<br />\n<br />\nSignifigance Lies<br />\nThe significance of President Nixon's recently presented military budget lies in the policies it reflects as well<br />\nas the savings it achieves.<br />\nThe $11 billion military budget, reduced by $5.2<br />\nbillion from last year, represents the smallest share in<br />\nrelation to the overall federal budget allotted to the Defense Department in 20 years. Equally important, the<br />\nmeans of saving money and shifts in spending indicate<br />\nnew concepts in military approach.<br />\nA large portion of the savings will come from a reduction in manpower of over half a million men between<br />\nthis year's budget and the proposed one for next year.<br />\nA certain number of those men will be G.I.'s current-<br />\n<br />\nly serving in Vietnam who will be brought home over<br />\nthe next year as part of the President's troop withdrawal plan. Although the exact number has not been<br />\ndisclosed, observers estimate that the amount of money<br />\nto be saved indicates a planned reduction of an additional 126,000 troops during fiscal year 1971.<br />\nWhile reflecting a continued desire to keep troop<br />\nstrength low, enough forces are provided to handle<br />\none major and one minor war at a time, rather than<br />\nthe two major and one minor war theory of the past.<br />\nThe new theory will be geared to fighting a major war<br />\nin Europe, not Asia.<br />\nThe budget also reflects a decreasing reliance on<br />\nnon-nuclear weapons, with more emphasis on nuclear<br />\nweapons. An additional $1.5 billion is being sought to<br />\nexpand the ABM to deter a Chinese attack and more<br />\nfunds for the Minuteman system to prevent a Soviet '<br />\nattack. On an offensive basis, another $1 billion will<br />\nbe needed to convert six Polaris submarines to accomodate the Poseidon missile.<br />\nThe savings in military spending further indicate the<br />\nAdministration's desire to curb inflation and to also divert funds for domestic needs.<br />\n<br />\nDecadent Discs<br />\nA high Greek official has criticized the music of Western youth as \"decadent\" and urged government censorship on those artists who perform it.<br />\nIn dedication ceremonies at a music house this week in<br />\na southern port city, Ioarmis j_sadas, an army officer who<br />\nhelped plan the successful coup of 1967,declared that the<br />\nstate cannot allow the spread of music and art which will<br />\nfoster the corruption of society. Only artists wliose works<br />\nwill lead to the education of society should be condoned<br />\nby the government, according to Ladas.,<br />\nHe pointed with pride to the ancient Greeks who used<br />\nmusic to \"satisfy the sensitive requirements of the human<br />\nsoul\" and criticized those Greeks who would sacrifice<br />\ntraditional music for the \"degenerate music...composed by drugaddicted hippies.\" Whereas the folk music<br />\nglorified emotions and sentimentality, Ladas said that<br />\ncurrent music \"arouses and suggests whatever sensual<br />\nrot exists.\" Not since former Indonesian President<br />\nSukarno ordered the burning of all Beatle records<br />\nto<br />\nrid the nation of Western influence has current music<br />\ncaused such a stir among world leaders.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "President's Discipline Code<br /><br />\nsee centerfold<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nthe johns hopkins university<br />\nVol. LXXI V, No. 17<br /><br />\nHONIEWOOD, BALTIMORE, Feb. 6, 1970<br /><br />\n74th Year<br /><br />\nPresident Alters SAC Discipline Code<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nPresident Gordon has released to the press his<br />\nfinal policy statement on University discipline, a<br />\nreport that contains several differences from<br />\nthe proposed issued by the Committee on Student Affairs.<br />\nIn a ten-page explanatory letter attached to<br />\nthe policy statement, Gordon stated that he<br />\nwill give \"serious consideration\" to any petition<br />\nfor a specific amendment which is signed by<br />\nmore than 25% of the faculty or student body<br />\nof any section of the University.<br />\nGordon has, in his report, altered the composition of the Review Board as proposed by the<br />\nCommittee on Student Affairs. The latest proposal has the board composed of three students<br />\nthree faculty . members and one administrator.<br />\nThe Committee's report had requested two<br />\ngraduate students, two undergraduate students,<br />\ntwo faculty members and one administrator.<br />\nGordon stated that this change, which maidtains the ratio on the review board proposed by<br />\nan ad hoc discipline Committee last summer,<br />\nwould prevent any segment of the community .<br />\nfrom having a majority of members. He believed<br />\na majority of any interest group would be<br />\nundesirable.<br />\nIn addition, Gordon retained expulsion as a<br />\npunishment. The SAC had eliminated that and,<br />\ninstead, suggested the possibility of \"indefinite<br />\nsuspension,\" with a yearly appeal. Gordon felt<br />\nthat this would set up two separate admissions<br />\nprocedures. He also suggested that the yearly appeal might turn into a \"sideshow.\"<br />\nGordon also added the phrase \"conduct that<br /><br />\nimpairs the effective functioning of the University...\" to the definition of behavior subject to<br />\nsanctions. He did not feel that sanctioning only<br />\n,behavior that infringed upon the rights of other<br />\npeople or groups would be sufficient.<br />\nFurther changes were made in the selection<br />\nprocedures and rules for open meetings of the<br />\nReview Board. Gordon gave the Board the power<br />\nto close its meetings, as he claimed open meetings \"might invite disruptive tactics.\"<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee was not informed by Gordon of his new proposal. This was<br />\ncalled by SAC Chairman John White of Art History as \"rude.\" Richard Conviser, a member of<br />\nSAC, stated that the president had \"violated\"<br />\nthe trust of the committee. He claimed that<br />\nhe would approve the SAC's proposal and, because of this, \"we went to the right of our first<br />\ndraft.\" He called Gordon's new statemenf \"A<br />\nbackwards way of doing things.\"<br />\nDr. Steve Mann of the Education department,<br />\na member of the Student Affairs Committee,<br />\nstated, \"He is wrong and we are right,\" when<br />\nasked his opinion of Gordon's report. SAC will<br />\nofficially respond to the new proposal next<br />\nweek.<br />\nBob Cotter, president of the Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization and also a member of the Committee, commented that they were \"sucked into this<br />\non good faith of having some sort of compromise,\" and since Gordon had violated \"that sort<br />\nof agreement, we should throw out the whole<br />\nthing.\" He accused Gordon of being \"paranoid.\"<br />\nGordon sent copies .of his revision of the ad<br />\nhoc Committee's report to the administrative<br />\nheads of the University's four divisions, asking<br /><br />\nthat they discuss it with whomever they deemed<br />\nnecessary. All divisions except Homewood sent<br />\nback the report unchanged last fall.<br />\nIn the Arts and Sciences division, Dean Kimball referred it to SAC, who considered the report last semester and sent back their recommendations at the beginning of January. It was<br />\nfrom these reports and conversations with faculty members that Gordon reached his final<br />\ndecision. Gordon stated that a covering letter<br />\non the SAC report from Dean Kimball expressed<br />\nconcern at the number of changes SAC had<br />\nmade. Gordon said that he also took these comments into consideration.<br /><br />\nGordon Advocates State Agency<br />\nFor Hospital and College Growth<br />\nTestifying before the State Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, Lincoln Gordon advocated<br />\nformation of a statewide borrowing authority to aid Maryland's<br />\nprivate. universities and hospitals<br />\nin financing construction.<br />\nIdentical bills providing for the<br />\nformation of a Maryland Health<br />\nand Higher Educational Facilities<br />\nAuthority are now in committees<br />\nof the Senate and General Assembly. The bills were pre-filed early in<br />\nNovember by Governor Mandel's<br />\noffice. Besides gubernatorial support, there appears to be a solid<br />\nmajority in both houses which<br />\nfavors the bill.<br />\nThe idea was first proposed to<br />\nGovernor Mandel by Lincoln Gordon and the bills were originally<br />\ndrafted by the Hopkins legal staff.<br />\nThe model for the borrowing<br />\nagency was derived from similar<br />\nagencies now in operation in nine<br />\nstates.<br />\nThe Authority, if constituted in<br />\nits present form, would substantially reduce the borrowing costs of<br />\nprivate institutions throughout the<br />\n\u2022-<br /><br />\nstate. It would be empowered to<br />\nissue revenue bonds against the<br />\ncollective credit of all of the<br />\nstate's private medical and educational institutions, thus substantially reducing the interest required<br />\nfor financing.<br />\nRevenue bonds issued against<br />\nthe credit of the proposed agency<br />\nmight carry an interest rate of 6.5%<br />\nto 7.5%. Private health and educational institutions which can now<br />\narrange financing through commercial loans are paying up to 11.5%.<br />\nIn addition to the added security<br />\nwhich stems from the collective<br />\ncredit of all private institutions,<br />\nbonds issued by the agency will be<br />\nexempt from federal and state<br />\ntaxation. They are thus more attractive to bond-holders, who need<br />\nnot pay taxes on income from the<br />\nbonds.<br />\nThe state will not have to donate<br />\nany revenues to the new Agency,<br />\nnor will the state's credit be on the<br />\nline when the Agency issues bonds.<br />\nThe authority will be set up with<br />\nrevenues allocated by the private<br />\ninstitutions themselves.<br /><br />\nThere appears to be little danger<br />\nthat the bill will not be passed in<br />\nthis session of the legislature. According to Frank DeFilippo, Governor Mandel's Press Secretary, no<br />\nopposition to the measure has<br />\nshown itself in either house. John<br />\nC. Eldridge, Legislative Aide to<br />\nMandel, said, \"How can anyone<br />\noppose it? There's not a penny of<br />\nstate money involved\u2014not even to<br />\nset the agency up.\"<br />\nHopkins will doubtless be the<br />\nschool to benefit most from the<br />\nnew agency. In his testimony,<br />\nGordon assured the members of<br />\nthe Finance Committee that Hopkins' planning $ 1 2 million per<br />\nyear. The total from all of Maryland's other institutions of higher<br />\nlearning will probably be considerably less than that figure.<br />\nAt present Hopkins is only planning one construction project<br />\nwhich might be financed through<br />\nthe new agency. The planned parking garage, to be constructed at a<br />\ncost of $3.5 million, might be financed in part or wholly by bonds<br />\nissued by the agency.<br /><br />\n\"For the next three years,\" Gordon stated,\"we anticipate no more<br />\nthan $5 million per year.\" He went<br />\non to say that he could not estimate the borrowing needs of the<br />\n\"hospital side.\" However, the total<br />\nhospital construction expenditures<br />\nin the entire state has averaged<br />\nonly about $12 million per year<br />\nfor the last two decades.<br />\nApart from new construction<br />\nprojects, the authority would be<br />\nable to lend money to colleges<br />\nand hospitals for the retirement ofy<br />\noutstanding loans and mortgages<br />\ncarrying higher interest rates.<br />\nAs it is presently construed, the<br />\nbill would apply equally to private<br />\nand state schools. There was a<br />\nproposal in committee, this week,<br />\nto eliminate state schools from<br />\nthe authority. State schools can<br />\nborrow money on the credit of the<br />\nstate; consequently at lower rates<br />\nof interest than would be made<br />\npossible by the new agency.<br />\nIn testimony supporting passage<br />\nof the bills, Gordon cited the successful establishment of similar<br />\nagencies in other states.<br /><br />\nFeb. 6, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nDorms Draw DSRC Complaint<br />\nBy RALPH MOLLER<br /><br />\nA common scene for the 585 students who inhabit Hopkins' dorms.<br /><br />\nGrowing dissatisfaction among dorm<br />\nresidents about their living conditions<br />\nhas aroused the normally impotent<br />\nDormitory Student Representative<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThis dissatisfaction was underscored<br />\nby a resolution passed in the Dormitory<br />\nStudent<br />\nRepresentative<br />\nCouncil on<br />\nThursday, January 29. It called for the<br />\nsecretary to send a letter of complaint<br />\nto the Baltimore City Department<br />\nof<br />\nHousing.<br />\nIn this letter, the DSRC said that it<br />\nat<br />\nfelt that the dormitory facilities<br />\nHopkins, \"particularly the old dormitory, do not meet the Building Code and<br />\nthat the University should be made aware<br />\nof these insufficiencies by the Bureau of<br />\nBuilding Inspection.\"<br />\nThe sponsor of this resolution Martin<br /><br />\nVogel, Vice-President of the DSRC,said<br />\nthat conditions in the old dorm such as the<br />\nabsence of fire escapes, insufficent<br />\nventilation and the lack of enough living<br />\nspace per person prompted him to take<br />\naction through the DSRC. He also stated<br />\nthat if the city found that the dormitories<br />\nwere substandard, it could compel the<br />\nUniversity to make repairs.<br />\nIf the dorms are declared substandard,<br />\nVogel added, hopes that the University<br />\nwould niake other changes that would<br />\nmake the dorms more comfortable for<br />\nthe residents<br /><br />\n\"Are in Violation\"<br />\nThere are differing opinions among<br />\nseveral administrators concerning the<br />\ndorms. Dean Carl P. Swanson said that<br />\nthe old dorms presently \"are in violation<br />\nof the Housing Code\".<br />\nMr. John McElwee, Secretary of the<br />\nBuilding and Grounds Committee, explained that the old dorms were built<br />\naccording to 1923 standards, andwouldn't<br />\nhave to meet the 1970 standards unless<br />\na major renovation was done. He confessed that he thought there might be<br />\nsome minor violations of the Baltimore<br />\nHousing Code, but the University would<br />\nnot be compelled by law to make repairs.<br />\nMcElwee said, however, that should<br />\nanything be uncovered, the University<br />\n\"would be willing to look at what the<br />\nInspector says.\"<br />\nAnother official of the University,<br />\nMr. John Peach, Assistant Plant Manager, held a different view. He denied<br />\nany knowledge of substandard conditions<br />\nat the dormitories.<br />\n\"To my knowledge,\" asserted Peach,<br />\n\"there are no flagrant violations of any<br />\ncity ordinances.\"<br />\nCity Inspection<br /><br />\nThe old dorms built in 1923 were declared by Dean Carl Swanson \"in violation of the Housing Code.\"<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br />\nLower The Vote<br />\nThe Hopkins Democratic Union (formerly the Young Dems) will sponsor a<br />\ntalk by Carl Friedler, representative<br />\nfrom Maryland's fifth district, entitled,<br />\n\"Lowering the Voting Age.\" The meeting will take place in the MSE Garrett<br />\nRoom of the Library, Tuesday, February 10 at 8:00 P.M.<br /><br />\n\"Virginia Woolf?\"<br />\nEdward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" will be performed on February 13, 14, and 15 by the Barnstormers in the barn, at 8:30 P.M.

These include checking<br />\nwindows, floors, ceilings, plumbing,<br />\nelectrical systems, etc. If the building<br />\nis found to be substandard, the landlord<br />\n(in this case the University) can be compelled to make repairs.<br />\nRegardless of whether or not the dorms<br />\nare substandard, many students, living<br />\nthere are unhappy. In the new dorms,<br />\nstudents found the immovable furniture,<br />\ncinderblock walls, and the standardized<br />\nsterility of the rooms somewhat oppressive.<br /><br />\nO.K. with Girl<br />\nOne resident of the new dorms, Ed<br />\nStehlik, commented, that the rooms_<br />\n\"were designed with economy rather than<br />\nlivability in mind.\" Another new dorm<br />\ninhabitant, John Widler, said rather sarcastically, \"when you've got a single<br />\nroom and girl living with you, it's not so<br />\nbad.\"<br />\nThe old dorms, however, draw most of<br />\nthe criticism.

The number is better<br />\nthan three times the quanity of applications received at<br />\nthis time last year.<br />\nIncluded in this number are nine applicationsfrom local<br />\nblack women interested in comingto Hopkins. Also, three<br />\nblack girls have filed applications to enter as transfer students next year.<br />\nOwens claimed that a major reason for the sharp increase in applications was that the admissions office<br />\n\"mounted a massive campaign\" to indicate that Hopkins<br />\nis interested in black students.<br />\nHe estimated that \"two<br />\nthousand students have been contacted to show students<br />\nthat we are interested.\"<br />\nMany blacks said that they had been interested<br />\nin Hopkins, but they had thought that Hopkins was<br />\nnot interested<br />\nIn them, Owens claimed.<br />\nOnce the interest was reciprocated, a strong response was received.<br />\nOwens attributed much of the success of the campaign<br />\nto black students presentl<br />\ny enrolled at Hopkins who devoted much of their intersession to talking<br />\nwith potential<br />\napplicants. Several blacks travelled around the country<br />\nto speak about Hopkins<br />\nwith high school seniors. The<br />\neffort was particularly intensive in Texas,<br />\nFlorida and<br />\nthroughout New England.<br />\nThere has been a nationwide distribution of<br />\napplicants,<br />\nbut a majority have come from the<br />\nEast Coast. Maryland,<br />\nNew York, New Jersey, and Pennsylv<br />\nania are the largest<br />\ncontributors of candidates with applications coming<br />\nfrom<br />\nCalifornia and some Western states.<br />\nOwens attributes the concentration to the fact<br />\nthat although Hopkins has a worldwide reputatio<br />\nn it is better<br />\nknown in the East than other parts of<br />\nthe country. He<br />\nindicated that the distribution of black applicants is not<br />\nSignificantly different from that of whites.<br /><br />\n\"This is probably the best way of recruiting for<br />\nyour school,\" said Owens, because if you can get current<br />\nstudents to push the school, then others will be more<br />\ninterested. He claimed that this could be the \"key to<br />\nthe whole thing.\"<br />\nA major concern of the campaign was to generate<br />\ninterest among black high school students in going to<br />\ncollege, then if they show interest they are asked to<br />\nconsider Hopkins. Owens is concerned with getting<br />\nmore blacks to go on to college as well as to get more<br />\nonto the Homewood campus.<br />\nOwens explained that when he goes to a high school<br />\nto recruit students, much of what he wants to do is to<br />\nshow that someone is interested in them. He then<br />\noffers Hopkins as a possible choice in an effort to<br />\n\"offer a broader choice of colleges.\"<br />\n.The admissions officer claimed that many of the students who have applied this year show great potential<br />\nas successful college students. \"A great number are<br />\narticulate and bright, but not all have been so good.<br />\nThat's the name of the game for admissions,\" said<br />\nOwens.<br />\nApplicants have indicated interest in varied fields,<br />\nranging from physics and chemistry to history or<br />\npsychology. Owens stated that he is pleased with the<br />\nblend in interest shown by those who want to come<br />\nto Hopkins.<br />\nThe admissions office now has to consider which of<br />\nthe students should be admitted to Hopkins. The next<br />\nmajor task is to get those who are accepted to come<br />\nto Hopkins next year. Owens said that many of the<br />\napplicants would probably get accepted by most of the<br />\nschools they apply to, and that Hopkins would have to<br />\nattract them to Homewood.<br />\nWilliam Brinkley, Director of Admissions, stated<br />\nthat he is very pleased with the work that Owens and<br />\nothers have done. He also expressed trust that more<br />\nblacks will come to Hopkins as a result of the program that has been conducted this year.<br /><br />\nRonald Owens, Assistant Director of Admissions:\"We mounted a massive offensive to indicate Hopkins' interest in black<br />\nstudents.\"<br /><br />\nWhites Asked to Drop Crowded Black Lit Class<br />\nBy RICHARD B. CRAMER<br />\nWhite students evinced a mixture of<br />\n. confusion, concurre<br />\nnce<br />\nand anger,<br />\nWednesday, when Frank Moorer, a black<br />\ninstructor in Dr. Richard Macksey's<br />\n\"\u2018Black Literature in America\" course<br />\nsuggested that white students drop the<br />\ncourse.<br />\nMoorer made no attempt to evict the<br />\nWhite students from the lecture, but<br />\nstated that he hoped to be \"so drastically boring that you (whites) will take<br /><br />\nthe incentive and leave.\"<br />\nThree whites actually left the lecture.<br />\nMacksey said he doubts that many more<br />\nwhites will drop the course. \"There are<br />\ntoo many masochists around for that,\"<br />\nhe added.<br />\nMoorer said that he \"didn't have time\"<br />\nto teach white students about black literature. That kind of course, he said,<br />\nmight take fifty years. The comments<br />\nwere made to the lecture section of the<br />\ncourse which includes all of the more<br /><br />\nthan one-hundred students who chose to<br />\ntake it. Moorer is directly in charge of<br />\none of the course's four sections, that<br />\ndealing with \"Negritude\". His section<br />\nis comprised primarily of black students,<br />\nbut Moorer did admit two whites who<br />\napproached him personally.<br />\nMoorer refused to comment on his<br />\nstatements, Wednesday night. He said,<br />\n\"I see no reason why a class should have<br />\nto explain to a newspaper what is going<br />\non.\"<br /><br />\nSAC Supports Co-eds in Frosh Dorms<br />\nOpposing the proposed plan to board<br />\nfemale under-graduates in McCoy Hall,<br />\nthe Student Affairs Committee sent<br />\na<br />\nresolution yesterday to the Academic<br />\nCouncil requesting that the women be<br />\nhoused in the freshmen dorms.<br />\nThe resolution supported the plan originally placed before the Council by the<br />\nad hoc Coeducation Task Force last<br />\nDecember as one of the alternatives for<br />\ncoed housing.<br />\nThe Council rejected the recommen-<br /><br />\ndations of the Task FOrce at that time as<br />\ntoo expensive. It was later decided to<br />\naccomodate the female transfers in McCoy Hall.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee stated<br />\nthat the present housing plan would reduce the social mixing of undergraduates afforded by coeducation and would<br />\npose a serious financial burden on the<br />\ngraduate students evicted from McCoy.<br />\nIt was also feared by the SAC that<br />\nthe McCoy decision would become per-<br /><br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee meeting Wednesday adopted a resolution requesting<br />\nthat<br />\nfemale transfers be housed in the freshman dorms.<br /><br />\nmanent. \"There is a grave danger that<br />\nwhat was intended as a temporary solution would at best remain in force for a<br />\nnumber of years and at worst become a<br />\npermanent arrangement,\" the resolution<br />\ncommented.<br />\nThe Task Force originally submitted<br />\nthree plans for coed housing to the<br />\nAcademic Council. Their first suggestion would convert Wilson and Wood<br />\nHouses of the old dormitories to facilitate women. John McElwee, the plant<br />\nplanner, estimated $150,000 for a major<br />\noverhaul of the two dorms. The Task<br />\nForce Report, though, noted that the<br />\nhouses \"do not presently meet building<br />\ncode standards,\" therefore must be<br />\nrenovated in any case.<br />\nPlan<br />\nB recommended converting<br />\nAdams and Baker Houses into female<br />\ndorms. They placed the price tag at<br />\n$80,000, including wall-to-wall carpeting and additional furnishings in the<br />\nrooms.<br />\nThe SAC resolved to support Pan B<br />\nfrom the independent findings of their<br />\nSubcommittee on Housing. However,<br />\nthe Committee suggested that the absolute minimum be spent on renovating<br />\nthe two dorms. They estimated that<br />\ndue to Hopkins' financial difficulties,<br />\nmodifications in the bathroom facilities<br />\nwould cost $5,000 with an additional<br />\n$3,000 for a laundary room.<br />\nThe resolution concluded that the<br />\n\"serious disadvantages of the proposal<br />\nto use McCoy Hal...would be deeply<br />\nresented on good grounds by both major<br />\ngroups of existing students in the University.\"<br /><br />\nMacksey described the situation as<br />\n\"potentially explosive.\" He refused to<br />\nspeculate on future developments, but<br />\nstated that in the future, lectures would<br />\nfeature guest lecturers and the sections<br />\n\"will be allowed to go pretty much their<br />\nown way.\"<br />\nMacksey hypothesized that much of the<br />\nstimulus for Moorer's remarks might<br />\nhave come from the size rather than the<br />\nracial make-up of the class. \"I detest<br />\nbig classes,\" he said. He emphasized<br />\nthat only twenty to thirty students were<br />\nexpected to take the course. At the start<br />\nof the semester, instructors were confronted with 150 class-cards.<br />\nBefore the start of this semester,<br />\nthe course was planned as a seminar.<br />\nWith the tremendous number of students<br />\nwho elected to take the course, the<br />\nsyllabus was changed to include lectures<br />\nand sections. Besides Moorer's section<br />\non Negritude, Macksey teaches a smaller<br />\ngroup of students about Black poetry. A<br />\nthird section, dealingwith autobiography,<br />\nis taught by Bob Hyde, a black senior.<br />\nThe fourth section, dealingwith fiction, is<br />\ntaught by Eleanor Wilner, a white graduate student in the Humanities Center.<br />\nThe course was originally conceived<br />\nby Moorer, who taught a similar course<br />\nto a largely white class last spring.<br />\nMacksey states that he recognizes the<br />\nneed for such a course although he feels unqualified to teach it himself. \"This<br />\nis a course I would like to take,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"but God knows not teach.\"<br />\nMoorer confirmed that he was disturbed by the number of students in the<br />\ncourse. \"We were expecting about twenty students at the most. We got entirely<br />\ntoo many students,\" he said.<br />\nA random sample of white students<br />\nleaving the classroom confirmed Macksey's belief that few would leave the<br />\ncourse. Many angered that they were<br />\nasked to leave at all. Macksey referred<br />\nto whites' confusion and anger by saying<br />\nthat Moorer had \"certainly opened himself to misunderstaning today.\" Macksey asked that whites look at Moorer's<br />\nactions of the last year carefully, however. In the spring term of last year,<br />\nMoorer taught Black Literature to white<br />\nstudents and received no salary for his<br />\nlabor.<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nFeb. 6, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nWolman: Militancy Needed for Conservation<br />\nBy STEVE BUCKINGHAM<br />\nLast Wednesday Dr. Abel Wolman<br />\nfurnished a group of interested listeners a large amount of information and<br />\nopinion relating to a subject which has<br />\nrecently become a matter of much public<br />\nconcern; water pollution.<br />\nDr. Wolman, one of the University's<br />\nProfessors Emeritus, gave his views<br />\non the management of the Chesapeake<br />\nBay to a crowded room of over 40<br />\npeople in the top of Ames Hall. Among<br />\nthose present were students and many<br />\nfaculty members including Dr. M. G.<br />\nWolman of the Georgraphy and Environmental<br />\nEngineering Department, the<br />\nspeaker's son.<br />\nAfter noting the grave problems confronting the Bay at the present and the<br />\nevents leading to their existence, he<br />\nturned to the attempts to solve them.<br />\nThere are, he said, thirty-nine administrative agencies concerned with management of the Bay. And from these<br />\nagencies have come a few similar recommendations for action.<br />\nAll of these groups propose additional study. This seems to be, according<br />\nto Wolman, \"the number-one solution,<br />\nnot always emanating from academic,<br />\nbut from commissioners created to do<br />\nthis, to do that. As someone has said<br />\nrecently on the Federal level, 'If you<br />\ndon't want anything done, appoint a<br />\ncommission to inquire it.\" Dr. Wolman criticized this as an answer to<br />\nthe problem because it provided for<br />\nno action, just study.<br />\nThe second possible action is the<br />\ndeclaration of a moratorium on all<br />\ndecisions and actions. This, of course,<br />\nis a very negative approach. Any public<br />\nofficial concerned with management of<br /><br />\nthe Chesapeake could say that he does<br />\nnot know enough and therefore should<br />\nnot act at all.<br />\nThe last recommendation that is frequently made is concerned with reorganization. \"Whenever anyone's confronted with a dilemma, again looking<br />\nfor a scapegoat if necessary, one recommends reorganization,\" argued Dr.<br />\nWolman.<br />\n\"A militant public opinion is obviously mandatory. However, it generates in<br />\nits wake vices as well as virtues unless it carries with it a full understanding of its militancy.\" Dr. Wolman stated that immediate action is<br />\nnecessary. Even if one in ten people<br />\nin Maryland was to do something about<br />\nthe Bay today, there would be more<br />\nthan enough existing programs waiting<br />\nto be carried out. These programs<br />\n\"do not have to depend on the emergence of additional scientific and technological information. They are worth<br />\ndoing regardless of what their future<br />\nresults may prove to be.\"<br />\nDr. Wolman expressed hope that the<br />\nGovernor's office would take a responsible role in managing the Chesapeake.<br />\n\"I have the feeling that integration (of<br />\nall the existing agencies) in the state<br />\nof Maryland with respect to the Bay<br />\ncan and must be provided at the chief<br />\nexecutive level. There is that opportunity, and let us presume that it (probably) will be made.\"<br />\nOne action by which the chief executive's office could make its influence<br />\nknown, is an attack on the legislative<br />\ntactics of the shellfish industry. Until<br />\nrecently, a small group representing<br />\nthe fishermen controlled the legislative<br />\nactions concerning the Bay. One of<br />\nMaryland's past governors even bowed<br /><br />\nhad to do with the three main polluters<br />\nof the Bay; the Baltimore Area,the Washington suburbs and the District of Columbia. There are, it seems, projected programs among the three areas amounting<br />\nto almost $500 million. Dr. Wolman<br />\nsuggested that these projects be immediately implemented. Here he noted that<br />\n\"perhaps half of that ($500 million) is<br />\nresident in the District of Columbia<br />\nwhere there is a kind of schizophrenia.<br />\nThat money from the District of Columbia must come out of the Federal Government which preaches the correction of<br />\neverything else, everywhere. This is<br />\nwhat I call an irony of political demonstration.\"<br /><br />\nto their pressure and withdrew his entire slate of bills affecting the Bay's<br />\nmanagement.<br />\nThe management of the Chesapeake<br />\nBay, Dr. Wolman contended, must find<br />\nits priority in relation to the other<br />\nitems in the state's budget. Not everything, of course, can be first priority,<br />\nand there never seems to be enough<br />\nmoney for all of the programs, despite<br />\nAmerica's affluence. But, Dr. Wolman<br />\nobserved \"our choices in the state of<br />\nMaryland are fairly clear; how much<br />\nmoney do we want to put into the management of the Bay, not how do we keep<br />\nreorganizing its management.\"<br />\nOne point brought up by Dr. Wolman<br /><br />\nParnstormers<br /><br />\nAttu\u2014<br />\nThe Barnstormers will be presenting \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" next weekend in Shriver<br />\nHall.

The<br />\nCommittee was appointed last month by<br />\nDr. Michael Beer, Vice-Chairman of the<br />\nGeneral Assembly. Beer, who was given<br />\nthe power to appoint the Committee in<br />\na faculty ballot in December, said that<br />\nhe had difficulty in getting faculty members to serve.<br />\nIn appointing the faculty members,<br />\nBeer indicated that he had looked for a<br />\nwide distribution in disciplines. The<br />\nmembers of the Committee are Dr.<br />\nWoodford Howard of Political Science,<br />\nDr. John Baldwin of History, Dr. Maurice Bessman of Biology, Dr. Jan Minkowski of Electrical Engineering and<br />\nProfessor Jerome Perlstein of Chemistry.<br />\nBeer said that he had avoided<br />\nfaculty members with extreme views<br />\non the governance issue.<br />\nThe Committee met with Beer a couple<br /><br />\nof weeks ago to clarify their task. They<br />\nchose Howard as chairman because, as<br />\nBessman put it, Howard i s in Political<br />\nScience and i s perhaps better qualified<br />\nto handle the post. Howard was not<br />\npresent at the meeting. The Committee<br />\nhad its first formal meeting at the<br />\nFaculty Club yesterday.<br /><br />\nThe Academic Council has charged<br />\nthe Committee with determining \"the<br /><br />\nmagnitude of. dissatisfaction (with the<br />\ngovernance of the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences) and recommend procedures.\"<br />\nA proposal that might be considered by<br />\nthe Committee if it finds enough \"dissatisfaction\" was offered by Dr. Francis Rourke, Chairman of the Political<br />\nScience Department. Rourke suggested<br />\nthat if a second Committee was recommended by the present one, it should be<br />\npaid to work over the summer. Such a<br />\nstep, said Rourke, would \"keep the<br />\nmomentun of such a study going.\"<br />\nThere has been no recent student<br />\naction on the governance issue. The<br />\nStudent Council has not had a quorum<br />\nat its rec9nt meetings, but some members stated that they will discuss governance at their Monday meeting.<br /><br />\n\"Keep Momentum\"<br />\nHoward declined to comment on Committee plans. He felt that his own opinions might be misinterpreted as those<br />\nof the Committee's, and would create<br />\nmisunderstanding before the Committee<br />\nhad even met. Howard said that he would<br />\ndiscuss Committee business as soon as<br />\nit started its planning.<br />\nBessman said that he \"hadn't been<br />\nthinking\" about the problems of governance before he was appointed to<br />\nserve on the Committee. He accepted<br />\nthe post, he said, as part of his \"university obligation.\" Bessman believed<br />\nthat he would be able to learn more<br />\nabout the subject through his committee work. Other Committee members<br />\ncould not be reached for comment.<br /><br />\nBob Cotter, President of the Graduate Students Organization said, \"We<br />\nhaven't done anything about the governance issue.\" Cotter also said that<br />\nhe was \"puzzled on how to approach<br />\nit,\" although he opposed putting the<br />\nissue into faculty hands. \"I am against<br />\nthe faculty doing this (governance) on<br />\nits own,\" he stated.<br /><br />\nDr. Woodford Howard of Political Science<br />\nwas chosen to head the ad hoc Governance<br />\nCommittee due to his scholarly knowledge<br />\nof politics.<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022=11.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nWe need yotii head<br />\nbusiness<br /><br />\nPt.

With funds provided<br />\nby the National Institute of Mental Health,<br />\nhe and his group did research at schools,<br />\njuvenile courts and law enforcement agencies.<br />\nHe described the drug abuse problem<br />\nas being \"like an iceberg,\" in that most<br />\nof it is not visible to the public. He<br />\nfound that few people except addicts<br />\nand law enforcement officers were able<br />\nto speak intelligently about drugs. His<br />\nresearch team discovered 700 addicts,<br /><br />\nforty-five per cent of whom were unknown to federal agencies. One signifigant finding of the study was that, in<br />\nthe past thirty-five years, the average<br />\nage of drug users has fallen from<br />\nthirty-five to twenty-one.<br />\nTo cope with the increasing drug<br />\nproblem, Nurco has developed a program consisting of four parts: education, prevention, management and treatment, and reserach and planning. Education will require \"teaching both the<br />\npositive and negative values of drugs...<br />\nCurriculum on drugs would be added to<br />\nall schools, grade schools to college.\"<br />\nPrevention involves \"specific places<br />\naround the state where those interested<br />\nor involved in the problem can be dealt<br />\nwith on a short-term basis.\"<br />\nNurco's third area of concern, management and treatment, will consist of<br />\nall programs throughout the state.

Frequently<br />\nconfused with hallucinatons, are what<br />\nWeil terms \"illusions\".<br />\n\"Perception becomes interpretable in<br />\ndifferent ways\", said Weil, \"A person<br />\nwho has taken marijuana can play with<br />\nhis visual perception,\" which is controlled, whereas a hallucination is a<br />\npurdy physical reaction induced by a<br />\ndrug.<br />\nWell also noted that marijuana en-<br /><br />\nables the user to control his auditory<br />\nperception. This explains why musicinduced pleasure is enhanced when one<br />\nis under the influence of marijuana.<br />\nThe physical affects of marijuana<br />\nare an increase in heartbeat, a drop<br />\nin blood pressure, a reddenning of the<br />\nwhites of the eyes and a dryness in<br />\nthe mouth.

He based his belief on the fact that for new<br />\nusers who smoked under laboratory<br />\nconditions there were few, if any psychological effects even though all the<br />\nphysical symptoms were present.<br /><br />\nPot Vs.

The marijuana<br />\nuser can cope with a situation such as<br />\ndriving a car no matter how much marijuana he has smoked. This is not true<br />\nwith a user of alcohol. A drunk person<br />\ndoes not have control of his faculties<br />\nas does a person who is stoned. \"The<br />\neffects of marijuana are very shapeable<br />\nto the user's desires,\" said Weil. \"In<br />\nfact, they are so maleable as to be suppressible.\"<br />\nWell mentioned that some peopla who<br />\nhave been stoned have been called upon<br />\nto perform some task, and have realized<br />\nonly after completing the task that they<br />\nhad done so while stoned.<br />\nWell criticized doctors who testify in<br />\ncourt the fact that a certain person is<br />\nor was stoned. He said, \"I believe<br />\nthat there is no sure way to tell that<br />\na person is on marijuana unless he tells<br />\nyou. I would testify to that in a court<br />\nof law\".<br /><br />\nWeil noted that adverse reactions<br />\nto marijuana are rare. \"Most people<br />\nwho get high\", said Weil, \"find the .<br />\neffects pleasant\". Those who do have<br />\nadverse reactions are either borderline psychotics or new users who have<br />\nan ambivalent attitude, toward using the<br />\ndrug.<br /><br />\nSubtle Disturbance<br />\nThe redness in one's eye could be<br />\ncaused by irritation from cigarette<br />\nsmoke and the increase in heartbeat<br />\ncould be attributed to physical exertion.<br />\nWell noted that there is a very subtle<br />\ndisturbance in the way people talk when<br />\nunder. the influence of marijuana.

He also<br />\nnoted that there is an increased tendency among people who are stoned to<br /><br />\nMENU<br /><br />\nExperience<br /><br />\nMost panic reactions result from the<br />\nsituation in which marijuana is used.<br />\nBut, Weil noted, this is often not so<br />\nmucn a reaction to the drug itself as<br />\nit is \"a reaction to the drug.\" The<br />\nnotices a change and becomes<br />\nuser<br />\nafraid of what is happening to himself.<br />\nThis is what causes a panic reaction.<br />\nWeil noted that in situations where the<br />\nmarijuana user<br />\nconsidered a social<br />\ndeviant, the possibility of a panic reaction is far greater than when the use<br />\nof marijuana is accepted.<br />\nWell also commented that in eating<br />\nmarijuana, or its more concentrated<br />\nform, hashish, one might well get sick.<br />\nThis is so because marijuana is toxic<br />\nwhen eaten.

In trying to explain why people<br />\ntake drugs, he elaborated on the concept<br />\nof \"escape and quest.\" He cited historical examples, ranging from Homer's<br />\n\"Odyssey\" to Tennyson's \"The Lotus<br />\nEaters.\"<br />\n\"They want on the one side to escape<br />\nfrom, fight against, defend against something and on the other they search for<br />\nsomething new, something better. Actually the second aspect is neglected in<br />\nthe discussion of drugs. It's always<br />\nthe escape aspect, not the search aspect<br />\nwhich is looked upon. All drug abuse<br />\ncan be explained by the law of escape<br />\nand quest, though the emphasis may<br />\nvary,\" Wurmser explained.<br />\nHe then identified four possible causes<br />\nof the drug user's attempts at escape<br />\nand quest. One was \"the individual<br />\nand his inner conflict,\" which he considered an outgrowth of modern society.<br />\nFamily background and the social condition were two others. The philosophical problem involved was the fourth<br />\npossible cause.<br />\nWurmser said that<br />\nusers claim they find \"a new integrity<br />\nby negation of old values.\"<br />\nPersonalities Jackie Robinson and<br />\nMarty Milner also spoke. Robinson<br />\naddressed the audience as a parent<br />\nwhose son was involved in the drug<br />\nproblem. His son is enrolled in Daytop, Inc., which is a self-help program<br /><br />\nrun by addicts.<br />\nAccording to Robinson, \"the biggest<br />\nproblem is fear in the homes of the<br />\nparents.\" He explained that they fear<br />\nruining their good images in the neighborhood and also upsetting their children. Because of these fears, they avoid<br />\ndiscussing drugs with their children<br />\nbefore they are exposed to them outside the home. Similarly, they avoid<br />\ndealing fully with any drug problem<br />\nthat their children do develop.<br />\nMartin Milner also spoke about adult<br />\nshortcomings. He works closelywith the<br />\nLos Angeles Police Department as the<br />\nstar of the television show \"Adam-12.\"<br />\nFrom this vantage point, he has been<br />\nexposed to the drug problem on a larger<br />\nscale than have most citizens.<br />\nHe spoke as a concerned citizen reacting against the hypocrisy of adults. As<br />\nan example he cited adult acceptance of<br />\nsuch marketed products as Compoz and<br />\nNo Doz. He said that such acceptance<br />\nis inconsistent with their condemnation<br />\nof the very similar pills, called \"ups\"<br />\nand \"downs,\" used by students.<br />\nDuring<br />\nthe<br />\nquestion-and -answer<br />\nperiod that followed the speeches, the<br />\nissue of the legalization of marijuana<br />\narose. Drs.Spiro and Wurmser expressed differing points of view.<br />\nSpiro opposed legalization on the<br />\ngrounds that he was unsure of experimental findings. From his work he has<br />\nfound that the drug can lead to withdrawal from society if used on a longterm basis and to psychotic disorders<br />\nif used on a short-term basis. Wurmser considered the issue of legalization<br />\nsubordinate to regulation of the drug<br />\nfrom its sources.<br /><br />\nJeep ;<br /><br />\nSUBS<br />\nPIZZA<br /><br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nMANY KINDS<br />\nSPAGHETTI<br />\nHOME MADE<br />\nCHICKEN<br />\nWITH FRENCH<br />\nPRIES AND ENGLISH MUFFIN<br /><br />\nThe Very Best<br /><br />\nHARRY LITTLE<br />\nCarry Out Shops<br />\n32nd near Greenmount<br />\n25th near Greenmount<br /><br />\nFull line of<br />\n4-wheel drive<br />\nwork and play<br />\nvehicles.<br />\nsat<br />\n6 OR V8 Aitiwl<br />\nWAGONEER<br />\nGLADIATOR<br />\n4 OR V6<br />\nUNIVERSAL<br />\nEXCITING lEEPSTER' SERIES!<br />\nTAKE A TEST DRIVE TODAY!<br /><br />\nSALES\u2022SERVICE\u2022 PARTS<br />\nFINE SELECTION OF USED CARS<br /><br />\nHERRING JEEP<br />\n310 W. 27<br /><br />\n889-1719<br /><br />\nA great place<br />\nto drink<br /><br />\nBaltimore's finest<br />\nwatering hole<br /><br />\nWEST WOOD'S<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nHopkius students, newt au old, eat dt:<br /><br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\nfor the finest Italian food in tows<br /><br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nSPAGHETTI MEALS<br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br /><br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE<br />\nCALL 889-3831<br /><br />\nMARES HEAD<br /><br />\nINN j<br />\nFeaturing the finest in domestic and imported beers and wines.<br /><br />\nLive below your means<br />\nIf you'd like to get around the high cost of living,<br />\nwe have a suggestion.<br />\nCut down on the high cost of getting around.<br />\nAnd buy a Voolkswagen.

Surprise!<br />\nIt should surprise no one that Lincoln Gordon has rewritten the draft of<br />\nthe discipline code submitted to him by the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs, and in substance completely rejected the recommendations of the<br />\nCommittee. Dr. Gordon is a firm proponent of committees, student \"input\" and other administrative devices. However, when the duly constituted committee on Student Affairs released the findings of four months'<br />\nwork, and issued a reasonable version of Dr. Gordon's discipline code, he<br />\nsaw nothing amiss in returning the code to its original intolerable form.<br />\nThe fact that the committee was not contacted after it had released its<br />\nreport is not surprising either, considering Dr. Gordon's obvious disregard<br />\nfor its recommendations.<br />\nIn September, Dr. Gordon proposed a discipline code which was objectionable on two counts primarily. The first point involved the possibility<br />\nof expulsion for an offending student. The second involved the composition of the review board. At the time, Dr. Gordon's plan was to man the<br />\nreview board with two students, two faculty members and one administrator.<br />\nThe Committee on Student Affairs studied the proposal and recomended that both of these facets of the code be altered. Expulsion, the report<br />\nof the committee contends, does not allow for the possibility of rehabilitation and concentrates on punishing, rather than reforming the student<br />\ninvolved. The committee recommended that long-term suspension be the<br />\nseverest penalty admissible.<br />\nDr. Gordon promptly replaced expulsion on the list of admissible<br />\npenalties. It apparently does not concern Dr. Gordon that a student who<br />\nis expelled carries that stigma throughout his life. Expulsion is irrevocable.<br />\nThe President's rationale for this move centers on the fact that the student<br />\ncan always reapply through normal admissions procedures. It would be<br />\nunfeasible, his report reads, to have two manners of admitting students.<br />\nHow many students does Dr. Gordon plan to kick out? Would their numbers place such a strain on Hopkins' bureaucratic workings?<br />\nThe Committee on Student Affairs also changed the composition of the<br />\nreview board for the better. Instead of two students, two faculty members and an administrator, the Committee's review board was comprised of<br />\ntwo undergraduates, two graduate students, two faculty members and an<br />\nadministrator. It seems only reasonable that students should be in the<br />\nmajority of a board which is called upon to judge only students. The<br />\nCommittee added the administrator to'the board only when Dr. Gordon<br />\ninsisted.<br />\nBut a lone administrator here and there is not enough for Dr. Gordon<br />\nHe completely reversed the Committee's recommendations and swung the<br />\nbalance on the board away from the students again. Dr. Gordon insists<br />\nthat faculty and students have an equal number of representatives with an<br />\nadministrator holding the deciding vote.<br />\nIn justifying ignoring this part of the Committee's recommendations, Dr.<br />\nGordon states that since Hopkins is a community (uh huh), all segments<br />\nof the University should get equal representation. Should all segments of<br />\nthe community be subject to this discipline code? Should not any consideration be given to the fact that the students comprise eighty-five percent of this community? Does equal representation involve giving an administrator the swing-vote on the review board for students?<br />\nIf Hopkins is truly a community, Dr. Gordon would agree that every<br />\nsegment of that community should be accorded the respect which accrues<br />\nto an equal partner. Unfortunately, he is not long on respect when a<br />\ncommittee tries to tamper with one of his master-plans. Such tamperings<br />\ntend to get ignored.<br />\nAnd if anyone is upset, all he need do is sign a petition protesting any<br />\npart of the President's statement. Dr. Gordon does not expect to see such<br />\na petition. If students want to see a just discipline policy, however, they<br />\nwill have to put together just such a petition, at least as a first step. We<br />\nsuggest that if the Student Council can raise a quorum, the organization<br />\nfor a petition might be a welcome reminder of the Council's existence<br />\nThe Graduate Student Organization and concerned faculty members<br />\nshould make a similar effort. We must warn, however, that getting Dr.<br />\nGordon to rethink a section of his discipline code will probably net yield a<br />\nreasonable policy.

It all began<br />\nin the Summer of 1968. Lincoln Gordon<br />\nhad read all about the mean students at<br />\nColumbia in Time and seen all those<br />\npictures of them in Life, and he thought<br />\nto himself, \"It can't happen here at the<br />\nHop!\"<br />\nAnd, so, what did he do? Why just what<br />\nyou or I would have done in such a situation; he appointed an Ad Hoc Committee,<br />\none of the all time great panaceas of<br />\ncollege presidents. And he charged this<br />\ngroup of learned men to go out among all<br />\nthe lands a return several months hence<br />\nwith a report which would explain how to<br />\nkeep these unruly mobs in hand.<br />\n'Twas not just the frosh and sophs who<br />\nhave no direction in life that Gordo feared; he also cowered at the thought of confronting an unruly group of rhetoricspouting, placard-carrying Hygiene students. And so this report was to apply<br />\nto all parts of this great University(does<br />\nanybody know the postage rates to<br />\nBologna, Italy?).<br /><br />\nA New Arrival<br />\nThus it was that in late spring of the<br />\nyear of our sit-in 2969 that Ad Hoc<br />\nand his committee gave birth to a \"Proposed Policy Statement on Student Conduct,\" and presented it to Lincoln, who<br />\nsmiled, and Wiped the sweat off his brow<br />\nand breathed a sigh of relief, as know<br />\nhe knew that the Georgian calm of his<br />\ncampus was secure from the political<br />\nupheaval he had known so well in Brazil.<br />\nBut, had you observed him reading<br />\nthe report, you would have seen a furrow<br />\ncross his brow. His trusted friend Ad<br />\nHoc had let him down; for here it said<br />\nthat a group of seven was to pass judgement on offenders and that four of those<br />\nseven were to be students; members of<br />\nthe unruly mob that he sought to temper.<br />\nBut Lincoln had not exhausted his remedies. After all, he was president! So,<br />\nhe simply sat down and changed the report around. Five people on the board,<br />\nand only two of them would be students.<br />\nAnd then, just to be sure, he stood in<br />\nfront of the meek freshmen and told them<br />\nof the report and its provisions and that<br />\nthey had better watch out no matter what<br />\nthey had read in the newspapers.<br /><br />\nThe Rape of the Report<br />\nSo, this newly revised edition was sent<br />\noff to nice, sane administrators and faculty in the hopes that they would tell Lincoln what a nice job he had done. But lo,<br />\nanother committee took hold of his report<br />\nand began to tear it asunder.It was comforting when the sane people in the Med<br />\nSchool and School of Hygiene and SAIS<br />\ntold him it was okay; never mind that<br />\nthe Student Government at the school of<br />\nHygiene had voted unanimously to reject<br />\neven the idea of such a policy.<br />\nOh, but at the Homewood campus this<br />\ncommittee was writing a whole new report. And after they worked and slaved<br />\nfor several months, they sent it in, and<br />\nthere, again, were the four students on a<br />\nboard of seven. A professor in the math<br />\ndepartment told him again that this was a<br />\nmajority, and he went into a titter. What<br />\ncould he do? For not only had they put all<br />\nof these students on this panel, but they<br />\nhad included reasons for their actions!<br />\nAnd what actions they were. No more<br />\nexpulsions! Like the general in Catch 22<br />\nwho knew he could shoot anyone he wanted to, Lincoln just knew that he could expel!. students.It was a Gilman-given right.<br />\nFurther, they said that students could be<br />\npunished only for abridging someone's<br />\nrights. There wasn't mention of the University running like a well-oiled machine.<br />\nSomeone certainly should be punished for<br />\nbeing a loose cog. And then they wanted<br />\nthis board to meet in the public, where<br />\neven the rabble could view its proceedings.<br /><br />\nReasonable Reasons?<br />\nWhat could he do? Of course such ideas<br /><br />\nas these could not be tolerated, but they<br />\nhad given reasons for these pats of their<br />\nreport, and so he must give reasons back.<br />\nAnother committee would not do, they had<br />\nlet him down twice already. So he had to<br />\nset out and do another revision.He would<br />\nstick with seven people on the board,but<br />\nonly three would be students. There would<br />\nalso be three faculty members and an<br />\nadministrator. The math department assured him that the good guys had a majority.<br /><br />\nForbidden Fruit<br />\nBut why? He needed a reason. And so<br />\nhe sat and wrote that no one segment of<br />\nthe University community should have<br />\na majority on such an important board.<br />\nThis looked real good since he had just<br />\nsaid that the other reports had wanted<br />\nfour students out of seven members.<br />\nNever mind that the committees had actually called for truly equal representation with two undergrads and two grads,<br />\nand that his make-up would guarantee<br />\nthat one of these groups would be shortchanged. Never mind that it made no<br />\nsense, it looked good and he had his<br />\nmajority.<br />\nAnd then he threw expulsions back in.<br />\nWhy, he wrote, we cannot have the school<br />\nacting as a rehabilitation agency. This,<br />\ntoo, sounded good, despite the fact no<br />\none had asked the school to be a rehabilitation agency, they only asked that the<br />\nreview board see once a year whether the<br />\nstudent might have been rehabilitated.<br />\nThis once-a-year appeal was also too<br />\nmuch for Lincoln. He let his paranoia<br />\nslip into his statement, expressing his<br />\nfear that this annual appeal might turn<br />\ninto a \"sideshow to be exploited for its<br />\npublicity potential.\" Never mind about<br />\naccomplishing justice, but God forbid<br />\nthat we have any sideshows.<br />\nFORBIDDEN FRUI<br />\nAnd then, there was the clincher. Lincoln wrote that such a policy gave the<br />\nstudents tenure, and Lord knows they<br />\ncan't have that. After all, professors<br />\nhave to sweat their balls off to get tenure<br />\naround here, and can you imagine students having something professors don't<br />\nhave many times over? God further forbid.<br /><br />\nAnd thus it was that Lincoln showed<br />\nthe world his paranoia as he thrust expulsion back into discipline. But now he<br />\nmust have some reason for punishing<br />\npeople who abridged no one's rights. And<br />\nso it came to pass that students could<br />\nnot harm the \"effective functioning\" of<br />\nthe University. The wheels must keep<br />\nturning, even over all those that got in<br />\nits way. Lincoln declared that the previous document was open to much too<br />\nmuch interpretatio, and thus this must<br />\ngo in.<br />\nAnd then Lincoln let his true colors<br />\nshine even more brightly as he wrote<br />\nthe reason for allowing the review board<br />\nto close its hearings. The paranoia oozes<br />\nall over the page as the Link writes that<br />\nopen meetings \"might invite disruptive<br />\ntactics.\" Never mind the spectre that<br />\nrises with such secrecy, never mind \"a<br />\nspeedy and Public trial,\" but please do<br />\nnot let us have any disruptive tactics.<br /><br />\nFor a Democratic Society<br />\nAnd so Lincoln sat back and looked<br />\nat his work and thought that it was good.<br />\nTo keep down the cries of totalitarianism<br />\nhe allows the community to petition, at<br />\nwhich time he will give serious consideration to amendments suggested by a<br />\nmere 25% of the student body. Never mind<br />\nthe fact that he had already ignored the<br />\nrecommendations of the closest thing to<br />\na democratic committee this University<br />\nhas.

Happily,<br />\nour recent experience makes clear that there<br />\ndoes now exist a widely shared consensus on<br />\nthe ways in which different segments of the<br />\ncommunity should seek to advance their interests and concerns, even though there are<br />\nmany differences of view on the best machinery of decision-making for our several divisions and for the University as a whole.<br />\nIf a serious crisis had arisen during my<br />\ntenure thus far as President, it was my intention to establish on an ad hoc basis some kind<br />\nof joint body drawn from the appropriate<br />\nstudent, faculty, and administration segments<br />\nof the community to assist me in the exercise<br />\nof my disciplinary authority. I believe it preferable, however, that there should be available in writing a broad statement of policy on<br />\nthese matters and a regularized procedure for<br />\ndealing with them.<br />\nThe general norms of appropriate behavior for the University community should<br />\nobviously be university-wide in character.<br />\nSince the Division of Arts and Sciences<br />\naccounts for by far the largest number of fulltime students, I thought it best to ask that<br />\nDivision to take the initiative in developing a<br />\nproposal for general consideration. To this<br />\nend, in the fall of 1968 I requested .Dean<br />\nAllyn W. Kimball to establish an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee to recommend a proposed policy<br />\nstatement which might be university-wide in<br />\napplication, including both the standards of<br />\nbehavior and the procedural arrangements to<br />\nprovide for their application to specific cases.<br />\nThe ad hoc Committee devoted a great<br />\ndeal of time to this matter during the subsequent several \u2022 . months, leading to a,._draft._<br /><br />\npolicy statement which was sent to me on<br />\nMay 29, 1969. While most of its proposals<br />\nseemed to me sound, there were a few respects<br />\nin which I felt it could be improved, I therefore prepared a revised draft, which I transmitted to members of the ad hoc Committee<br />\non July 7, 1969, with a letter of explanation.<br />\nI also sent the revised draft to each of the<br />\nacademic deans with a request that they<br />\nconsult with such faculty and student representatives they thought appropriate and report the comments or suggestions during the<br />\nfall of 1969 in order that a final statement<br />\nmight be prepared.<br />\nDuring the fall of 1969, I received replies from the Deans of the Schools of<br />\nMedicine, Hygiene and Public Health, and<br />\nAdvanced International Studies, indicating<br />\nthat they found the July 7 draft acceptable.<br /><br />\nPRESIDENT LINCOLN GORDON<br /><br />\nI also received comments from a number of<br />\nindividual faculty members in various divisions, some of whom raised doubts as to<br />\nwhether the third paragraph of the then proposed definition of behavior subject to sanctions (which I had taken intact from the<br />\nad hoc Committee's proposal) might be excessively broad and subject to misinterpretation.<br />\nIn the case of the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences, Dean Kimball referred the July 7<br />\nto the Committee on Student Affairs,<br />\ndraft,<br />\n_<br />\nwhich made its comments and suggestions in<br />\nthe form of a complete redraft. This was<br />\ntransmitted to me, along with an explanatory<br />\nstatement, by Dr. John White, Chairman of<br />\nthe Committee, with a covering letter dated<br />\nJanuary 5, 1970. In Dean Kimball's official<br />\nletter of transmission, he stated some concern<br />\non a number of the modifications suggested<br />\nby the Student Affairs Committee, notably<br />\non one aspect of the definition of unaccept#ble.beh,ayior, the sanctiort of.ANDuisioa.-.and--<br /><br />\nthe reserve authority of the President and the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.<br />\nThe net result so far, therefore, has been<br />\nthe preparation of three draft statements, all<br />\nof which contain a substantial amount of<br />\ncommon content but which also contain<br />\nsignificant differences. Three of our academic<br />\ndivisions have found the July 7 draft acceptable, whereas the Arts and Sciences Committee on Student Affairs recommends significant<br />\ndepartures from the proposals contained in<br />\nthat draft.<br />\nIt has been suggested to me that it might<br />\nbe appropriate to constitute still another<br />\nad hoc committee on a university wide basis<br />\nto seek to reconcile the differences and<br />\nproduce yet another consolidated draft, but I<br />\nam hesitant to impose this further burden on<br />\nbusy individuals in view of the year and a half<br />\nof devoted effort already applied to the matter by so many members of the community.<br />\nI have therefore prepared a revised draft<br />\nstatement in the light of the three previous<br />\ndrafts, the comments received from the various deans, the written views of faculty<br />\nmembers already mentioned, and the explanatory statement transmitted by the Arts<br />\nand Sciences Committee on Student Affairs<br />\non January 5. The revised proposal is appended hereto.<br />\nThe reasoning underlying the main provisions of this final draft may be summarized<br />\nas follows.<br />\n1. Introduction \u2014 Preamble<br />\nThe substance of the preambular statements is similar in all three drafts. Since the<br />\nversion of the Committee on Student Affairs<br />\nis the shortest and simplest, I have incorporated it intact in the new proposal.<br />\n2. Introduction \u2014 Definition of Behavior<br />\nSubject to Sanctions<br />\nThis definition was identical in the drafts<br />\nof May 29 and July 7, and was substantially<br />\ncondensed in the proposal of the Committee<br />\non Student Aftairs. The latter version omitted<br />\nthe original third paragraph referring to the<br />\nrelationship of the University to the larger<br />\ncommunity, incorporating a portion of this<br />\nconcept under the phrase \"the rights of other<br />\nindividuals or groups,\" with the explanatory<br />\nstatement making clear that this covers both<br />\nthe University community and the larger<br />\ncommunity of which it is a part. The Student<br />\nAffairs Committee draft also omitted reference to the \"interests\" (as contrasted with<br />\n\"rights\") of others and omitted reference to<br />\ndisruption of \"the normal functioning of the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nThe stated reasons for the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee revision are generally persuasive except on one point. That is the<br />\nabsence of any explicit recognition of the<br />\nbroad institutional interest in the effective<br />\nfunctioning of the University. Since the term<br />\n\"groups\" is intended to cover formal and<br />\ninstitutional groups as well as informal groups',<br />\nit might be argued that it is all-embracing,<br />\nbut it might also be construed as requiring-in<br /><br />\nPRESIDENT'S STATEMENT ON DISCIPLINE<br /><br />\nFeb. 6, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER SUPPLEMENT<br /><br />\nDraft Abolishes Immediate Interim Expulsion<br />\n(continued from preceding page)<br /><br />\neach case an identification of and representations by the injured parties. At the same<br />\ntime, the ambiguity of the term \"normal<br />\nfunctioning\" is properly criticized in the<br />\nexplanatory statement of the Student Affairs<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nIn any event, a broad definition of this<br />\ntype must depend upon interpretation and<br />\napplication to specific cases by quasi-judicial<br />\nprocedures. The argument of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee that particular sections of<br />\nthe University might construe the standards<br />\nin any way they like is scarcely persuasive,<br />\nsince it is the Review Boards which will have<br />\nthe responsibility of definition in particular<br />\ncases.<br />\nIn the light of all these considerations,<br />\nthe new draft incorporates the shorter version<br />\nproposed by the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs with the final clause modified as<br />\nfollows: \"or conduct that impairs the effective functioning of the University or causes<br />\ndamage to its physical facilities.\"<br />\n3. Interim Suspension, Definitive Suspension, and Expulsion<br />\nThe July 7 draft distinguished between<br />\nminor and major sanctions, the latter consisting of definitive suspension or expulsion<br />\nwhich could not be imposed without prior<br />\naction by a Review Board. In emergency<br />\ncases, it provided for the administrative imposition of \"immediate interim suspension,\"<br />\nsubject to prompt subsequent consideration<br />\nby a Review Board.<br />\nThe Committee on Student Affairs recommended the elimination of the concept of<br />\nimmediate interim suspension, for the reasons<br />\nset forth in Section 17 of its explanatory<br />\nstatement. The Committee emphasized that<br />\nthe retention of student status during an<br />\nemergency implies no special protection from<br />\naction by the civil authorities should that become necessary. The Committee draft also<br />\nprovided for an emergency convocation of the<br />\nReview Board (no later than the next day) in<br />\nemergency cases. On balance, these points are<br />\npersuasive to me, and the new proposed draft<br />\ntherefore also omits provision for immediate<br />\ninterim suspension.<br />\nThe Committee on Student Affairs also<br />\nproposed that the sanction of expulsion be<br />\nabolished, although it is not clear whether<br />\nthis proposal was meant to apply to academic<br />\nperformance as well as to student conduct.<br />\nTermination of student status for sustained<br />\nmeet minimum academic<br />\nfailure<br />\nto<br />\nstandards is a long-standing feature of the<br />\nacademic scene at all universities, including<br />\nJohns Hopkins, and the Student Affairs<br />\nCommittee made no reference to it. The argument that the University should forego the<br />\npossible application of this sanction in cases<br />\nof extreme misconduct incompatible with the<br />\nacademic enterprise does not seem to me<br />\npersuasive.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee sought<br />\nto justify its position on grounds of the<br />\npossibility of social education and rehabilitation, but this argument implies a false analogy<br />\nbetween society as a whole and the University. The wider society does have a respons-<br /><br />\nDean Allyn W. Kimball, who forwarded the President's July<br />\n7 draft on to the Committee on Student Affairs. The committee later substantially rewrote the document.<br /><br />\nibility for promoting rehabilitation, but that<br />\nis not a proper function or obligation of the<br />\nUniversity in all cases.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee suggested the possibility of unlimited suspension as<br />\nan equivalent to expulsion, subject to the<br />\nthe right of the student involved to annual<br />\nappeal. This proposal distorts the concept of<br />\nsuspension, which should be for a definite<br />\nperiod. Since the University does not bar<br />\napplication for readmission by an expelled<br />\nstudent, the difference in practice comes<br />\ndown to whether consideration of readmission should be through the ordinary admissions procedures or through the Review<br />\nBoards established under the new Student<br />\nConduct Policy. On the reasonable assumption of some limit on the number of available<br />\nplaces, it does not seem wise to have two<br />\npotentially competing admissions processes or<br />\nto set up an automatic priority for indefinitely suspended former students as against new<br />\napplicants. Since the composition of Review<br />\nBoards will change from case to case and<br />\nfrom year to year, a Board would in the event<br />\nof appeal have to familiarize itself with a case<br />\nin the perhaps distant past. Moreover, the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee has probably underestimated the danger of an annuarappeal<br />\nbeing converted into a distracting sideshow to<br />\nbe exploited for its _publicity potential but<br />\nwithout positive value to the University.<br />\nFinally, the proposal of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee paradoxically appears to<br />\ngive a kind of \"tenure\" to students who have<br />\nnot graduated simply because they were once<br />\nadmitted. Administrative officers have no<br />\ntenure and faculty members receive tenure<br />\nonly after a substantial period of professional<br />\nservice and an elaborate case by case review<br />\nprocedure.<br />\nFor these reasons, the new proposed<br />\ndraft retains the sanction of expulsion. It<br />\nshould go without saying that this sanction<br />\nwould be applied only in cases of the most<br />\nserious violazions of the standards of conduct<br /><br />\nset forth in the policy statement.<br />\n4. Composition of Review Boards<br />\nThe ad hoc Committee draft of May 29,<br />\n1969, and the Student Affairs Committee<br />\ndraft of January 5, 1970, proposed that the<br />\nReview Boards be composed of four students,<br />\ntwo members of the faculty, and one administrator. The July 7 draft proposed a membership of five, made uP of two students, two<br />\nfaculty members, and one member of the<br />\nadministration. In my explanatory letter of<br />\nJuly 7, I set forth the position that the<br />\nstandards of conduct are of essential concern to all three full-time components of the<br />\ncommunity (faculty, students, and administration), and that none of these elements should<br />\ntherefore be given a Board majority. I also<br />\nfelt that it would be easier to convene a group<br />\nof five than a group of seven. These proposals<br />\nwere found acceptable by three of our<br />\nacademic divisions.<br />\nAlthough the practice in other universities is not necessarily indicative of what<br />\nJohns Hopkins should do, I thought it helpful<br />\nto collect information on the composition of<br />\ncorresponding Boards from a number of<br />\ncomparable institutions which have recently<br />\nrevised their machinery for quasi-judicial<br />\nprocedures of this type. The results are as<br />\nfollows:<br />\nUniversity of California<br />\nUniversity of Chicago<br />\nCornell University<br /><br />\nDuke University<br /><br />\nHarvard University<br /><br />\nUniversity of Hawaii<br /><br />\nIndiana University<br />\nUniversity of Maryland<br />\nNew York University<br /><br />\nPennsylvania State<br />\nUniversity<br />\nPrinceton University<br /><br />\nUniversity of Rochester<br /><br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin<br /><br />\nall faculty<br />\nall faculty and adminstration<br />\nHearing Board of four<br />\nfaculty, four students,<br />\none administrator, two<br />\nnon-faculty staff; Review Board of two<br />\nfaculty, two students,<br />\none administrator<br />\nfive faculty, fourteen<br />\nstudents, with appeal<br />\nto President or Provost<br />\nthree faculty without<br />\nadministrative responsibilities, three faculty<br />\nwith administrative responsibilities, and three<br />\nstudents<br />\ntwo faculty, two students, and one administrator<br />\none student, one faculty, one administrator<br />\nall faculty<br />\none faculty, one student, one chosen jointly by those two<br />\nall faculty<br />\nthree faculty, three students, one administrator, and a chairman appointed by the President<br />\nfive faculty, five students, one administrator<br />\nall faculty<br /><br />\nIt will be noted that in this group of<br />\ninstitutions, with the exception of Duke,<br />\nnone of these Boards contains a student<br />\nmajority. The considerations on this point<br />\nset forth by the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs are certainly of weight, but they do<br />\nnot seem to me to be controlling. The refer-<br /><br />\nFeb. 6, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER SUPPLEMENT<br /><br />\nPRESIDENT'S STATEMENT ON DISCIPLINE<br /><br />\nUniversity, However, Retains Right to Expel<br />\nence to peer groups would be more pertinent<br />\nto a jury than to a quasi-judicial Board of the<br />\ntype contemplated. The key point insufficiently weighed by the Committee is that, unlike the other types of decisions referred to in<br />\nits explanatory statement, cases that might<br />\narise under the proposed policy statement<br />\nmay affect the vital fabric -- or even the<br />\nsurvival -- of the institution as an effective<br />\nacademic enterprise. For these reasons, I<br />\ncontinue to believe that none of the fulltime segments of the community should be<br />\nrepresented by a majority on the Review<br />\nBoards.<br />\nWhether the membership should be five<br />\nor seven seems to me a minor point. In view<br />\nof the argument set forth by the Committee<br />\non Student Affairs, I have proposed a total of seven, composed of three faculty members,<br />\nthree students, and one administrator.<br />\nThere remains the problem of the method of selection of Review Board members.<br />\nThe July 7 draft proposed that the administration member be appointed by the Dean concerned and the faculty and student members<br />\nbe chosen by lot from membership pools<br />\ninitially selected by appropriate representative processes within each division. The Chairman was also to be selected by lot. The Committee on Student Affairs proposed a selection<br />\nby lot from all the full-time members of the<br />\nthree respective groups, with the Chairman to<br />\nbe chosen by a vote of the Board itself.<br />\nThis proposal raises problems of a strictly practical character. The faculty numbers<br />\nmore than three hundred in each of the three<br />\nBaltimore academic divisions, and the student<br />\nbodies range from three hundred to over three<br />\nthousand in the case of the Division of Arts<br />\nand Sciences. If a workable ad hoc Review<br />\nBoard is to be constituted quickly, especially<br />\nin emergency cases, it would appear essential<br />\nto arrange for the prior constitution of pools<br />\nof persons who would know that they might<br />\nbe called on for service on a Review Board<br />\nand would feel themselves willing and able to<br /><br />\nperform such service. Arrangements could also<br />\nbe made to acquaint the members of these<br />\npools with pertinent procedures and legal<br />\ndecisions bearing on this responsibility.<br />\nFor these reasons, the new proposed<br />\ndraft provides for the constitution of membership pools by random selection from<br />\nappropriate stratified groups of the respective<br />\nfull memberships. A supplementary statement<br />\nwould be prepared for each division setting<br />\nforth the details of this selection process.<br />\nIn the case of the Division of Arts and<br />\nSciences, where the largest numbers are involved, it is contemplated that the faculty<br />\npool might number thirty-five, selected on a<br />\ndepartmental basis with two members each<br />\nfrom the nineteen smaller departments. The<br />\ngraduate student pool could be constituted in<br />\nthe same way and in the same numbers. For<br />\nundergraduates, nine representatives of each<br />\nclass.could be selected at the beginning of the<br />\nacademic year, making a total of thirty-six.<br />\nThe number of administration members is<br />\nsufficiently small to make unnecessary any<br />\npreselection of a pool. The initial random<br />\nselection process would include the drawing<br />\nof alternate names, who could replace in the<br />\npool those members initially selected who felt<br />\nthemselves unable or unwilling to serve.<br />\nThe proposal that the Chairman be<br />\nselected by the Board itself appears sound and<br />\nhas been incorporated in the new draft. I<br />\nhave also added a sentence in Section II, paragraph 1, providing for assistance on procedural<br />\nmatters by University counsel if a Review<br />\nBoard so desires.<br />\n5. Open and Closed Hearings<br /><br />\nThe drafts of May 29 and July 7 were<br />\nsilent on this question. The Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs proposed that all Review<br />\nBoard hearings be public unless the student<br />\nconcerned requests. a closed hearing. Experience elsewhere suggests that his proposal is<br />\nunwise, since it might invite disruptive tactics<br />\nmaking it impossible for the Review Boards<br />\nto function effectively. For this reason, the<br />\nnew draft permits the Review Boards themselves to determine whether the hearings shall<br />\nbe open or closed, but makes them closed in<br />\nany event if the student so requests.<br />\n6. Weight of Decisions by Review Boards<br /><br />\nWilliam Bevan, Vice-President and Provost of the University.<br />\nAlthough not mentioned in the statement, he has received<br />\npraise from everyone concerned for his help in its formulation.<br /><br />\nOn this point, the May 29 draft was<br />\nsilent, whereas the July 7 draft and the proposal of the Committee on Student Affairs<br />\nboth explicitly recognized the ultimate legal<br />\nauthority-of the Board of Trustees and of the<br />\nPresident, with respect to student conduct.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee draft, however, then stated that \"it is to be expected,<br />\nhowever, that decisions of the Review Boards..<br />\nwould be carried out,\" whereas the July 7<br />\ndraft added the clause \"unless there were<br />\nextraordinary and compelling reasons' for a<br />\ndiffering action on the part of the final<br />\nconstituted authorities.\"<br />\nWhile the Student Affairs Committee<br />\nis of course entitled to express its own expectation, an endorsement by me of the language proposed by that Committee might be<br />\n\"construed as an unqualified delegation of<br /><br />\nDr. John White, Chairman of the Student Affairs Committee.<br />\nToday's draft from the President's office incorporates much<br />\nof the committee's work of the past months.<br /><br />\npower which would be inconsistent with the<br />\nStudent Affairs Committee's own statement<br />\nelsewhere in its explanatory statement that<br />\nthe administration would hold \"the final<br />\n,power of veto over its decisions.\" All versions<br />\nof the proposed new policy already constitute<br />\na large delegation of authority in relation to<br />\nthe present situation. The new policy is necessarily experimental in character, and it is my<br />\nearnest hope that it will not have to be put to<br />\nthe test of extreme circumstances. Should that<br />\noccur, however, it would not appear wise to<br />\nwaive entirely the possibility of a final review<br />\nat presidential or Trustee level. Such a review<br />\nmight, as I pointed out in my letter of July 7,<br />\nresult in a modification of a Review Board decision in either direction, i.e., toward greater<br />\nleniency as well as greater severity. In an<br />\nextremely critical case, the version proposed<br />\nby the Student Affairs Committee would<br />\nleave the President and Trustees no option<br />\nbut to revoke the entire policy statement, an<br />\nact which might gravely intensify an already<br />\nprofound institutional crisis.<br />\nFor these reasons, the language in the<br />\nnew proposed statement incorporates the<br />\nadditional language of the July 7 draft.<br />\n****<br />\nThere remains the question of appropriate procedures for the formal adoption of the<br />\nproposed policy. Since this is a universitywide matter, the new draft is being circulated<br />\nto all full-time segments of all the academic<br />\ndivisions.<br />\nIf a petition for a specific amendment,<br />\naccompanied by a statement of supporting<br />\nreasons, is endorsed by one-fourth or more of<br />\nthe fulltime student or faculty body in any<br />\ndivision prior to March 31, 1970, I will give<br />\nserious consideration to that proposal in<br />\nconsultation with representatives of the<br />\ngroup concerned. If no such petition is received by March 31, I intend to discuss the proposal as appended herewith with the Board<br />\nof Trustees, with a view to its formal prp(continued on following page)<br /><br />\nPRESIDENT'S STATEMENT ON DISCIPLINE<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER SUPPLEMENT<br /><br />\nFeb. 6, 1970<br /><br />\nReview Board Composition Changed to 3-3-1<br />\n(continued front preceding page)<br /><br />\nstages of considering possible changes in tkie<br />\npresent arrangements for decision-making in<br />\nthe several academic divisions, which in<br />\nturn might also lead to new arrangements<br />\nfor<br />\nconsidering<br />\nuniversity-wide<br />\ngiven to this subject by faculty and student<br />\npolicy questions.

We are in the early<br />\nPROPOSED POLICY STATEMENT<br />\nON STUDENT CONDUCT<br />\n(Draft of January 26, 1970)<br />\nI. Introduction<br />\nTo attempt to define rules of conduct in<br />\nterms of specific forms of misconduct is to<br />\nrisk omissions and to provoke a series of<br />\nafter-the-fact amendments that weaken the<br />\nforce of the original policy statement. Rather,<br />\nit is preferable that such rules be stated in<br />\nterms of the general characteristics which<br />\nidentify such classes of behavior, and that<br />\nfair procedural arrangements provide for their<br />\napplication to specific cases. The University's<br />\nmethods should be those of rational inquiry<br />\nand dialogue. Thus, the application of behavioral sanctions to its students is an inherently distasteful process. However, traditional<br />\ndependence on self-discipline by members of<br />\nthe academic community does not in fact<br />\nalways prevent actions prejudicial to the rights<br />\nof others. Every university is therefore compelled to seek policies and procedures that<br />\nensure its integrity as a social institution. In<br />\ndoing so, however, it must be mindful of the<br />\ninterests and rights of its members, must uphold the right of free speech, and must not<br />\nbetray its humane tradition.<br /><br />\nII. The Sanctions of Suspension or Expulsion<br />\nThe sanctions of suspension or expulsion<br />\nmay be recommended by the chief administrative officer of the Division or his designated<br />\nrepresentative but the sanction shall be applied only on the basis of a hearing for the<br />\nstudent charged with misconduct by an ad hoc<br />\nReview Board composed of fellow students<br />\nand members of the faculty and administration. The hearing shall be conducted in<br />\nconformity with the following principles.<br />\n1. A Review Board shall be constituted<br />\nwhen needed and shall consist of three<br />\nstudents, three faculty members, and one<br />\nadministrator. A Review Board may call<br />\non University counsel for assistance in<br />\nprocedural matters. Members shall be<br />\nselected by random drawing from membership pools constituted at the beginning of each academic year and composed of full-time members of the above<br />\nmentioned groups. In any case where<br />\ntotal membership of a group exceeds 35<br />\nin number, a membership pool will be<br />\nconstituted through random selection<br />\nfrom appropriate groups (departments,<br />\nclasses, etc.), with the specific arrangements set forth in a supplementary statement of procedure for each academic<br />\ndivision. The chairman of the Board shall<br />\nbe chosen by a vote of the Board.<br />\n2. A Review Board shall have the power<br />\nto confirm the recommended sanction,<br />\nto impose a more severe or lesser sanction, or to exonerate the student charged<br />\nwith misconduct.<br />\n3. The student shall be notified in writing of the charge against him, of the recommended sanction, and of the time<br />\nand place of the hearing. Every effort<br />\nshall be made to make contact with the<br />\nstudent, including the sending of a<br />\nregistered letter to the student's last address, as given by the student to the<br />\nUniversity. The- sending of this letter<br />\nshall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of notification.<br />\n4. Both the Review Board and the student may call and cross-examine wit_<br />\nnesses of their choice.<br />\n5. The student may select someone to<br /><br />\nThe broad class of behavior which may<br />\nbe subject to appropriate sanctions consists of<br />\nconduct that abridges the rights of other<br />\nindividuals or groups, especially as it affects<br />\nthe educational goals of those within the<br />\nUniversity community, or threatens their<br />\nsafety, health, or property, or conduct that<br />\nimpairs the effective functioning of the University or causes damage to its physical facilities.<br />\nThe University will not intrude itself into the personal lives of its students nor will it<br />\nadd sanctions for unlawful behavior already<br />\ndealt with by civil authority, unless such<br />\nbehavior falls within the class of conduct<br />\ndescribed above. It is understood that sanctions are to be rationally applied and commensurate with the seriousness of the precipitating misconduct. The presence of any<br />\nextenuating circumstances will also be weighed before imposition of University sanctions.<br />\n'<br /><br />\n4i7tt<br />\nMembers of the<br /><br />\nCommittee on Student Affairs at<br />\nThe committee represented the only group which<br />\nisfaction ,y/j,th, the,j,Prpsi4e,nt.'sJuly 7 conduct daft.Wednesday's\u2022meeting.<br />\n.. .expressed<br />\n\u201e<br />\n. . dissqt\u2022\u2022<br />\n-\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n--\u2022\u2022\u2022 - \u2022 -<br /><br />\n\u2022 -<br /><br />\n\u2022 '<br /><br />\ntial advance over the preexisting status of a<br />\nformal policy vacuum.

The Review Board will determine whether hearings should be open or closed,<br />\nbut they will be closed if so requested by the student. Whether hearings<br />\nare open or closed, the Board shall<br />\nretire to reach its decision. The<br />\nBoard shall then make a public<br />\nstatement of the decision reached and the<br />\nsanction imposed, if any. If the Board<br />\ndeems it appropriate it may also make a<br />\nstatement of the reasons underlying its<br />\ndecision. A record of these statements<br />\nshall be kept.<br />\n7. Records of closed proceedings shall be<br />\nconfidential and may be divulged only<br />\nwith the student's written permission.<br />\nThey shall be destroyed upon his graduation or within four years after his departure from the University, whichever<br />\ncomes first.<br />\n8. A Review Board shall always meet<br />\nwithin five working days of the recommendation of a sanction.<br />\n9. In cases of emergency where the recommendation of suspension of expulsion is involved, and upon request of the<br />\nprincipal administrative officer of the<br />\nDivision or his designated representative,<br />\nthe Review Board will be called to meet<br />\nnot later than the next day, and the<br />\nstudent will be informed of this decision.<br />\n10. If the administration declines to act<br />\non an allegation of misconduct made by<br />\nany member of the University, the complainant may request the constitution of<br />\na Review Board for a hearing.<br />\nIII. Other Sanctions<br />\nSanctions other than suspension or expulsion may be imposed by the principal<br />\nadministrative officer, or his designated representative, without mandatory Review Board<br />\nconsideration. However, any student upon<br />\nwhom such a sanction has been imposed may,<br />\nwithin two academic days following due<br />\nnotice of the sanction and of his right of<br />\nappeal, request in writing to the principal<br />\nadministrative officer or his designated representative that his case be reviewed. In this<br />\nevent a Review Board will be convened within<br />\nfive working days of the receipt of the student's appeal from the sanction. The principles described above for conduct of hearings<br />\nby Review Boards shall be followed.<br />\nIV.

It is to be<br />\nexpected, however, that decisions of the<br />\nReview Boards established pursuant to this<br />\npolicy statement would be carried out unless<br />\nthere were extraordinary and compelling reasons for a differing action on the part of the<br />\nalethaities*. \u2014<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nFeb. 6, 1970<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nfeaturesium.<br />\nBruce,Corgell: Super Supergroup<br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nThe much-publicized demise of Cream<br />\nled to the much-publicized birth of BlindFaith, the first of the million dollar<br />\nsupergroups and the biggest musical disappointment of last year. Now Cream has<br />\nsired another supergroup, this one extremely successful, one that legitimately<br />\ndeserves the name.<br />\nIn this era when the untalented mindless feedback of Led Zeppelin,Creedence<br />\nClearwater Revival, and the recently revivified Rolling Stones earns large<br />\nfortunes, few people have heard of or<br />\nremember Jack Bruce and even fewer<br />\nknow who Larry Coryell is. Last weekend they played four sets together at New<br />\nYork City's painfully uncomfortable Fillmore East, secnd on the bill(Larry CorYell?- who the hell is he?) to a slightlybetter-than-mediocre<br />\nquartet named<br />\nmountain.<br /><br />\nTop Bass Player<br />\nIndividually, Bruce and Coryell have<br />\ndemonstrated what great music can be.<br />\nBruce started by studying the cello,<br />\nmoved to singing Scottish folk songs,<br />\ntook up electric bass with various<br />\nEnglish jazz groups, then various rock<br />\ngroups, next lead bass for Cream. Last<br />\nOctober SONGS FOR A TAILOR, a solo<br />\nalbum, was released, surpassing in<br />\nquality Blind Faith's first and last<br />\nrecord. There<br />\nare none who can<br />\nchallenge Jack Bruce's position as the top<br />\nbass player in rock music.<br />\nLarry Coryell first made an impression in the music world as guitarist in the<br />\njaz -oriented Gary Burton Group, then<br />\nmoved on to two solo albums, LADY<br />\nCORYELL and the re\u2022-ent CORYELL.<br />\nThe first record is a strange alloy of<br />\nrock and jaz (the latter predomination),<br />\ncombining successful technical effects<br />\nwith virtuoso technical brilliance. Coryell's second album utilizes more diverse supporting instrumentation but is<br />\nless jazz than LADY CORYELL.<br />\nTogether, Bruce and Coryell produced<br />\ngenius greater than the sum of its parts.<br />\nLast summer they jammed in Slugs, an<br />\nEast Village jazz club. Plans were made<br />\nfor some shows at the Fillmore, but<br /><br />\nFluid And Superb<br />\nAfter the introduction and the first<br />\nflashes of the consistently obnoxious<br />\nJoshua Light Show, Bruce, his back to<br />\nthe audience, slapped out a few solid,<br />\nthick notes, alone, over and over again.<br />\n\"Politician\", an old Cream blues. Bruce<br />\ncomposed the tune. The words, like the<br />\nwords to practically all Bruce songs, are<br />\nby Pete Brown,an English poet who works<br />\nin the plastic new-dope school of pretentiousness and imagistic extravagance.<br />\nThe bass is fluid and superb, Bruce<br />\nracing his fingers over his crimson<br />\nGibson EB-3 with controlled celerity.<br />\nAnd Coryell is daz ling, his notes clear<br />\nand sharp and tightly organized, never<br />\nmonotonous, truly creative improvisation, playing with a skill equal to<br />\n(surpassing?) that of an Eric Clapton.<br />\nAnd the singing. Bruce stumbles over<br />\nsome words, forgets others, but it really<br />\ndoesn't matter. His eyes are closed the<br />\nwhole time, with such a contented smile<br />\nbearded face. \"Hey now<br />\nhis<br />\non<br />\nbaa-beeee...\"<br /><br />\nKitchen Linoleum<br />\nBruce is one of the most underrated<br />\nvocalist around. Every put-down of<br />\nCream I have ever read accused the group<br />\nof lacking a competent singer. Part of the<br />\nblame for this must be placed on producer<br />\nFelix Pappalardi, who seems to have run<br />\nBruce's voice through a filter -sterilizer<br />\ndevice which eliminates the rough edges.<br />\nThe finished product is clean and smooth<br />\nand as attractive asfreshly waxed kitchen<br />\nlinoleum. (B.B. King has suffered this<br />\nsame fate of vocal emasculation in some<br />\nof his studio recordings.) SONGS FOR A<br />\nTAILOR, which Pappalardi also produced, is a noticeable improvement, but<br />\nstill nothing like his actual singing.<br />\nAfter<br /><br />\n\"Politician\" Jack Bruce and<br /><br />\nI U5ED To DREAM OF<br />\nWHAT I 1,(MTC(2 TO<br />\nSE A5 A 6RowtJUR<br /><br />\nFriends played non-stop three songs<br />\nfrom SONGS FOR A TAILOR. The first,<br />\n\"Weird of Hermistion\", was disappointing in that no matter how hard Bruce<br />\npushed with his bass and voice, and no<br />\nmatter how well Coryell followed,<br />\nMitchell and Mandel could not catch up.<br />\nThe lag between lead and rhythm was<br />\nespecially obvious in the choruses. Perhaps an example of the flaws of impromptu jam sessions. Spontaneity is<br />\nmost satisfying when the whole band is in<br />\nsome way unified in their spontaneity.<br /><br />\nVery Together<br />\nThe next two songs, \"Tickets to<br />\nWaterfalls\" and \"Theme for an Imaginary Western\", were much more successful, Mitchell and Mandel redeeming<br />\nthemselves for their previous inadequacies. Excellent performances, very together.<br />\nThere followed a long nameless jazz<br />\ninstrumental. Some of Coryell's riffs<br />\nwere reminiscent of \"Stiff Neck\" on<br />\nLADY CORYELL; maybe that was the<br />\nsong. Coryell's start-at-the-top-andplay-every-goddamn-note-on-the-waydown riffs are never less than intrigenjoyable. Unfortunately,<br />\nand<br />\nuing<br />\nBruce and Coryell were not as close on<br />\nthis song as on the others.<br />\n\"The Clearout\", from SONGS FOR A<br />\nTAILOR, was the next piece, beginning<br />\nwith Mitchell's vicious thrashing and<br />\nfading out with soft organ notes. In<br />\nbetween, Bruce and Coryell: what more<br />\ncan I say?<br />\nThe 45-minute set (much much too<br />\nshort) concluded with \"Sunshine of Your<br />\nLove\". perhaps Cream's most famous<br />\nsong (music by Bruce and Eric Clapton,<br />\nwords by Pete Brown.) The primitive<br />\nbeat came from the small stage like a<br />\nvolcano, reinforced by heavy organ<br />\nchords. This time, Bruce sang all the<br />\nwords. I was very surprised that Bruce<br />\nwould do this song and \"Politician\",<br />\nconsidering the numerous derogatory remarks he has made in interviews about<br />\nthe quality of Cream's music. But that's<br />\nnot very important.<br />\nWell, was it jazzy or was it rock? What<br /><br />\nBass player Jack Bruce. in a purple corduroy suit, singing at the Fillmore East last<br />\nweekend.<br />\nPhoto by James Hollis<br />\nis a rock bassist doing jamming with a<br />\njaz guitarist, or is it a jazz bassist jam ming with a rock guitarist? (Remember<br />\n\"Flute Thing\" by the Blues Project?<br />\n\"The fusion of rock andijazz.\") Questions such as this one are as anserable<br />\nand valuable as debates over whether a<br />\nwhite man can sing the blues or the death<br />\nof God or etc. etc. The correct labels are<br />\ntalent and imagination, not rock and jazz.<br />\nI have heard unsubstantiated stories that<br />\nBruce and Coryell are making an album<br />\ntogether.

The<br />\nlast strike, at the beginning of 1966, resulted in only a 22 day stoppage.<br />\nAlthough the contracts of three different locals expired on December 31, only<br />\none of the three, Local 31 of the Web<br />\nPressman's Union, voted to go on strike.<br />\nThe other two groups, the mailers and<br />\nthe printers, immediately supported the<br />\n, action although they are not officially on<br />\nstrike. Also backing the strikers is the<br />\nreporters' guild, as well as other newspaper -oriented unions.<br /><br />\nThe fact that the\u2022 strike actually occurred came as somewhat of a surprise<br />\nto the public, as little indication had been<br />\ngiven by either side that an impasse was<br />\ndeveloping. Furthermore, sources at the<br />\nSun indicated that they had not anticipated that the Web Pressmenwould hold fast<br />\nto a \"No Contract--No Work' position.<br />\nIn the past, many contract disputes have<br />\nbeen resolved after the expiration deadline has passed.<br />\nUnofficial sources indicated that the<br />\nPressmen's Union is presently in the<br />\nthroes of an internal power struggle<br />\nbetween the older leaders and a group<br />\nof more radical dissidents. Ostensibly,<br />\nthe outcome of this battle will have an<br />\neffect upon the duration of the strike.<br /><br />\nAlthough the proceedings, including<br />\ntime and place of the labor-management discussions, are cloaked in secrecy, the issues at hand seem to involve<br />\nboth wages and operational procedure.<br />\nThe union apparently is demanding pay<br />\nscale parity with that of Washington<br />\npressmen.<br />\nThe pressmen in Washington negotiated a new two-year contract last October<br />\nwhich provided for atop minimum salary<br />\nof just over $200 weekly. Baltimore's<br />\npresent equivalent to that is $164. Other<br />\nissues separating the pressmen and the<br />\nBaltimore publishers include union de-<br /><br />\nmands that the papers increase management conributions to a health and accident fund and that management agree to<br />\na two-year contract rather than the three<br />\nyear contract which was originally offered.<br />\nThe most significant issue at the moment, however, and the one which appears<br />\nto be holding up all other discussion, revolves around the question of operation-or 'manning', in newspaper jargon.<br />\nManning refers to the number of<br />\npressmen needed on any given day, a<br />\nnumber which is dependant upon the size<br />\nof the newspaper being run on that day.<br />\nBecause of fairly significant fluctations<br />\nin news content, particularly onSundays,<br />\nthe manning situation results in a great<br />\ndeal of uncertainty for the junior press-<br /><br />\nment, who are the first to be laid off in<br />\nslack times and the last to be called up<br />\non good days.<br />\nTHORNY PAST<br /><br />\npapers. A high official of the Sun said<br />\nof the demand; \"Featherbedding, that's<br />\nwhat it is.\" Union officials refused to<br />\ncomment on the charge.<br /><br />\nThe manning question has been a thorny<br />\nproblem in the past and last year the matter was put up for arbitration. The thenbinding decision came out in favor of<br />\nmanagement, and the union has apparently been seething ever since. In the negotiations it has demanded that a fixed<br />\nnumber of pressmen be permanently<br />\nemployed.<br />\nThe publishers claim that this would<br />\nresult in an intolerable situation for them,<br />\ncausing men to be idle on slow days and<br />\nforcing the short-term (and hence, expensive) hiring of extras for fuller<br /><br />\nBoth sides implicity acknowledged that<br />\nother considerations are lurking in the<br />\nbackround, too. Although the printers<br />\nand the mailers are not actually on strike,<br />\nthe contract deadlines of four other unions are up for renogotiation in the coming months. These include the stereotypers in March, the photo-engravers<br />\nin April, the reporters in June and the<br />\nteamsters in July. It is clear that any<br />\nsettlement that is reached with the<br />\nstrikers will have a major effect on<br />\nfuture negotiations.<br /><br />\n(continued on page 15)<br /><br />\nProfessor Connects Estrogen To Cancer<br />\nAs Controversy Over 'The Pill' Grows<br />\nFor years the Food an Drug Administration has been telling 8,500,000 women<br />\nwho take oral contraceptives that \"the<br />\npill\" is an extremely safe and efficient<br />\nmethod of birth control despite growing<br />\nevidence that the birth control pill may<br />\nhave very dangerous side effects.<br />\nThe dangers of the pill were brought<br />\nout into the open during a recent Senate<br />\nhearing at which Dr. Hugh J. Davis,<br />\nassistant professor in Obstetrics and<br />\nGyncecology<br />\nat the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, was the first speaker. Evidence<br />\nwas presented stating that the pill may<br />\ncause blindness or blurred vision, migraine headaches,liver malfunction, pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lung)<br />\nand breast cancer.<br />\nFour days after the hearing, the FDA<br />\nreversed its position and mailed letters<br />\nto 30,000 doctors, which were predated<br />\ntwo days before the hearing. The letter<br />\nspecifically warned of the dangers of<br />\nthrombophlebitis (blood clot in the leg)<br />\nand pulmonary embolism resulting from<br />\nthe use of the pill. Studies were cited<br />\nshowing that women taking the birth control pill have a four to seven times great-<br /><br />\ner risk of these disorders than nonusers.<br /><br />\nThere is other evidence linking estrogen to breast cancer. Males who have high<br />\nlevels of estrogen, such as transsexuals,<br />\nhave a higher incidence of breast cancer.<br /><br />\nEstrogen Content<br />\nThere are two types of pills available<br />\nin the U.S.: combination pills in which a<br />\nsynthetic progesterone is given with a<br />\nsmall dose of synthetic estrogen for 21<br />\nstraight days; and sequential pills in<br />\nwhich estrogen alone is given for 14 - 16<br />\ndays and then a combination pill is given<br />\nfor the rest of the cycle. There is some<br />\nevidence that the higher estrogen level<br />\nfound is sequential pills more frequently<br />\ncauses a thrombus formation than the<br />\ncombination pills.<br />\nIt is the estrogen in the pill which has<br />\nbeen connected with cancer. Estrogen<br />\nlevels several times greater than that in<br />\nthe pill when given to five different species of mammals have caused the development of breast tumors. The FDA feels<br />\nthat this does not indicate proof of any<br />\ndanger to women from the pill. Dr. Davis<br />\nhas pointed out that when five disparate<br />\nmammalian species are already shown to<br />\nbe susceptible to a drug,then the chances<br />\nof another species being susceptible if<br />\nyou give the drug long enough are very<br />\ngood.<br /><br />\nNo Warnings<br />\nPerhaps the most insidious effect of the<br />\nFDA's old attitude toward the pill is that<br />\nfew users have known that there was<br />\npossibility of danger involved. There are<br />\nno warnings on the prescription medications, and doctors do not tell their<br />\npatients of the side effects. A recent<br />\nGallup poll showed that 80% of women<br />\nwho use birth control pills said that no<br />\none had told them about the possible dangers involved.<br />\nThere is one danger of the pill which<br />\neven Hopkins undergraduates have to be<br />\nconcerned with. The increase in the use<br />\nof the pill has caused a decrease in the<br />\nuse of condoms, thus leading to a rise<br />\ninthe incidence of venereal disease.<br />\nThe pill is supposed to be 100% effective<br />\nin preventing pregnancy. The artificial<br />\nhormones in the pill supress the body's<br />\nproduction of the pituitary gonadotrophins (sex gland stimulating hormones)<br />\nwhich cause ovulation.<br /><br />\n(continued on page 15)<br /><br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nCLEANERS<br /><br />\nART GALLERY<br /><br />\nComplete Bachelor Service<br /><br />\nPortraits, Paintings, Framing<br /><br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n467-2123<br /><br />\nGALLERY G, Ltd.<br />\n710 Reisterstown Rd.<br />\nPikesville 484-7171<br /><br />\nST.

Whereas<br />\n\"Hearst's News-American has<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nMembers of the striking Web Pressman's Union in front of the Sunpapers<br />\noffice on Calvert Street.<br /><br />\nofficially laid off all members<br />\nof the company's ownNews Union<br /><br />\nOther Devices Found Imperfect<br />\n(continued from page 14)<br />\nHowever, every year, 40 - 50% of the women who<br />\nare taking the pill stop using it for reasons such<br />\nreasons such as cramps, headaches, weight gain,<br />\nloss of libido, or desire to have a child. Of these<br />\nwomen, 80% become pregnant. \"Perhaps it would<br />\nbe more accurate to say that the failure rate of<br />\nthe pill as a sterility measure is closer to 40%<br />\nsaid Dr. Davis.<br />\nAlthough the obvious best form of birth control<br />\nIs abstinance, most couples view this methodwith<br />\ndistaste. With the ever widening availability and<br />\nuse of other contraceptive methods, both men and<br />\nwomen are finding and demanding a greater happiness in sexual relations correlating to the decreasing fear of pregnancy.<br />\nVaginal Inserts<br />\nFor those women who cannot tolerate the pill,<br />\nor who fear side effects from its use, there is<br />\nno other \"perfect\" method of birth control. The<br />\nintrauterine device (IUD), a small ring or spiral<br />\nshaped object inserted into the uterus by a physician, is claimed to be 95% effective. The exact<br />\nway in which the IUK acts is not known, although<br />\nIt is believed to speed the descent of the egg so<br />\nthat the sperm cannot fertilize it, or the egg may<br />\nreach the uterus at a time when it cannot nest<br />\nthere. Dr. Davis, a specialist in the study of IUD's<br />\nstated that \"about 5% of women who request<br />\nthis method cannot adapt due to bleeding, discomfort, and cramping.\"<br /><br />\nThe major fear of the woman who uses the<br />\nIUD and very definitely wishes to avoid pregnancy is that in 5 - 10% of IUD users?ftie device<br />\nmay be spontaneoulsy expelled. If the women is<br />\nobservant and finds it before having relations,then<br />\nit may be reinserted by the doctor and pregnancy<br />\navoided. IUD's are available for young women<br />\nWho have already had a child. Because the IUD<br />\nrequires little motivation'on the part of either<br /><br />\npartner, it has found wide approval by Family<br />\nPlanning Clinics operating in inner-city areas.<br /><br />\nSperm Prevention<br />\nOther types of contraceptive measures work on<br />\nthe principle of preventing sperm from entering<br />\ninto the uterus. The traditional condom offers<br />\na high degree of protection when used correctly<br />\nand consistently. Failures are due to tearing of<br />\nthe sheath or slipping off after climax. The condom does have some disadvantages; both women<br />\nand men complain of some interference with sensation, hinderance in spontaneity of sexual relations and with the male inability to maintain<br />\nan erection while the condom is being applied.<br /><br />\nthus making them eligible for unemployment insurance, the Sunpapers reporters are still employed and can theoretically collect their paychecks if they cross<br />\nthe picket lines.

Reports indicate an up to 14%<br />\nfailure rate, although according to Dr. Davis<br />\nfailures result not from any defect in the diaphragm, but because the women failed to use it<br />\nwhen having relations.<br />\nChemical methods of contraception in the form<br />\nof creams. jellys, tablets, and foams act to coat<br />\nvaginal surfaces, destroy sperm cells and provide a mechanical barrier.

To date, the<br />\ncenter is running on a large deficit despite the availability of a $207,000 federal grant. Dr. Wurmser explained that<br />\nthe grant requires matching funds from<br />\neither state, city, or private sources;<br />\nSince these funds have not materialized, only $130,000 of the grant has been<br />\nutilized.<br />\nOne of the major reaons why the 200<br />\npatient center has suffered financially is<br />\nthe disinterest shown by Baltimore.<br />\nThough most of the addicts are from<br />\nthe city, Baltimore has contributed<br />\nneither funds nor support to the center.<br /><br />\nThe Only One<br />\nThe Drug Abuse Center is the only<br />\none of its kind in the Baltimore area.<br />\nThe older Project Adapt and Man Alive<br />\norganizations were established as maintenance clinics where heroin addicts<br />\ncould come and receive free treatment<br />\nand narcotics substitutes. The Drug<br />\nAbuse Center, however, is attempting<br />\nnot only maintenance of the drug addict<br />\nbut also the long-range posibility of complete detoxification.<br />\nBecause the center supports only one<br />\nfull-time and four part-time physicians,<br />\nthe waiting-list for care at the center<br />\nis long, and, due to this need for selectivity<br />\nof patients, uncooperative or<br />\ntroublesome addicts must seek other<br />\nalternatives. Of prime importance to the<br />\nfunctioning of this program is the sin-<br /><br />\ncerity and motivation of the addict himself. It is up to the addict to return<br />\npromptly for daily medication and weekly<br />\ncounseling sessions.<br />\nMany addicts are, however, pressured<br />\neither by family, probation officers or the<br />\ncourts to attend the center, according to<br />\nits staff members. Unfortunately, such<br />\npressures hardly insure that the addict<br />\nhas any desire to quit and many such<br />\npatients require constant supervision,<br />\nwhich the center is unable to provide.<br />\n10,000 Baltimore Addicts<br />\nBecause the center has such limited<br />\ncapabilities and only handles a small<br />\npercentage of the city's 10,000 addicts,<br />\nit is forced to treat only the most hopeful and thus utilize its resources to the<br />\nfullest. In treating heroin and cocaine<br />\naddicts, the center uses an artificial<br />\nnarcotic substance called methadone.<br />\nThe heart of the methadone treatment<br />\nis that the patient becomes addicted to it<br />\ninstead of heroin. Methadone has none<br />\nof the withdraw al and vomiting symptoms<br />\nthat accompany heroin, and, most importantly, prevents the 'up' sensation.<br />\nHeroin also has a cummulative affect,<br />\nso that the demand for it in the system<br />\nincreases with use. Methadone, however,<br />\nis able to maintain the present addiction<br />\nlevel without further development.<br />\nJane Carbary, one of the three fulltime nurses at the center, related some<br />\nof the problems that arise with methadone and the addict. She explained that<br />\nthe dosage of methadone depends upon<br />\nthe extent of present addiction; consequently, medication is based on the<br />\naddict's assessment of his own situation. Most addicts don't display such<br />\ncooperative tendencies, so much of the<br />\ncenter's work is hindered and many<br /><br />\naddicts drop out after a few days.<br />\nAmong the other problems the center<br />\nhandles is that of maintaining an addict.<br />\nA large segment of the center's patients<br />\nhave neither the strength nor the will to<br />\nquit their present rate of addiction. The<br />\ncenter is then forced to maintain them<br />\non methadone indefinitely, perhaps even<br />\nfor life. Nevertheless, this is still more<br />\ndesirable than abandoning the addict, because maintenance keeps the patient in<br />\ncontact with the center so that he is no<br />\nlonger forced to steal to satisfy his needs.<br />\nMaintenance also allows the center to<br />\nmonitor the addict's progress and, hopefully, to motivate him to quit at a later<br />\ndate.<br /><br />\nMethadone Addiction<br />\nMiss Carbary also detailed the progress of an addict who wishes to kick<br />\nthe habit. If the desire to quite is genuine,<br />\nthe addict then accepts less and less<br />\nmethadone over a period of time relative<br />\nto his capabilities. So far, however,only<br />\none addict has been completely detoxified<br />\nat the center.<br />\nAddicts, in addition to maintenance or<br />\ndeclining addiction treatment, receive<br />\ncounseling and job placement, but the<br />\ncritical shortage of volunteers to aid in<br />\nthese activities has kept the center limited in scope. As of now,only addictive drug<br />\nabusers are treated at the center.Abusers of lesser drugs such as grass, hash<br />\nor acid receive only marginal advisory<br />\naid.<br /><br />\nEducational Efforts<br />\nThe Drug Abuse Center has also been<br />\nrunning programs to contact and inform<br />\ngroups around the city. Film series,<br />\nlectures and panel discussions are fea-<br /><br />\nPETti40ONE<br /><br />\nto WG<br />\nalre<br />\nCNAfiniCNT<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThe Drug Abuse Clinic in East Baltimore addicts the patient to methadone<br />\ninstead of heroin.<br />\ntured at high schools and other community centers. Such education is also<br />\na regular part of the addict's treatment.<br />\nDespite the center's efforts, the prospects for the future are not good. The<br />\ncenter is understaffed, under-funded and<br />\nignored by the city. The methadone treatment has its good points, but it only prolongs the problem rather than cure it.<br />\nThere are no plans to expand, although<br />\naddicts must constantly be returned to<br />\nthe streets because of shortages.<br />\nOne of the problems noted by the center<br />\nis its frequent use by addicts as a temporary source of maintenance until they<br />\ncan return safely to the streets and back<br />\nto harder narcotics. Financially,there is<br />\nlittle new developing for the center. Even<br />\nthe hoped for Sklar-Mendel Act, presently before the Maryland State Legislature would not benefit the program;<br />\nthe act calls for limited funding of state<br />\ninstitutions and the center does not qualify in this respect.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nBiggest Bust<br />\nStudents at the University of Denver are recovering<br />\nfrom a drug bust which took place there in late January.<br />\nA nighItime raid by Denver police on four dormitories<br />\nand eight off-campus housing units resulted in the arrest<br />\nof 42 students, the most ever arrested in a campus bust.<br />\nIt surpasses the State University of New York at Stony<br />\nBrook raid of 1968 in which 28 were arrested.<br />\nStudents at U. of Denver reacted to the incident by<br />\nproviding four thousand dollars in student fees to help<br />\nmeet bail costs of those arrested. Between 1,0001,500 students gathered at the union building, the jail,<br />\nand then the state capitol to protest the action.<br />\nA principal complaint by students involved the use of<br />\nthree \"mod\" police agents who posed as students to<br />\nobtain information. A University official confirmed that<br />\npolice had been engaged in such activities for a month,<br />\nbut claimed the administration had no part in it.<br />\nThe officials defended the police as having properly<br />\nexercised their duties, and the Chancellor implied that<br />\nthe raid served some good by arresting 19 people on<br />\ncharges of selling drugs. They, he felt, are the real<br />\nculprits.<br /><br />\nExpect Long War<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\nThe North Vietnamese people have been warned by<br />\ntheir leaders to be prepared to continue the fight against<br />\nthe U.S. for many more years.<br />\nLe Duan, First Secretary of the Communist Party,<br />\nuttered the warning during the keynote speech he delivered this week at ceremonies marking the 40th Anniversary<br />\nof the founding of the party. He is believed by some to<br />\nbe emerging as the dominant figure in North Vietnamese<br />\npolitics.<br />\nWhile Duan declared his country's desire for peace,<br />\nhe made clear that it must involve \"independence and<br />\nfreedom.\" He blamed the continuing war on U.S. unwillingness to recognize the rights of the Vietnamese<br />\npeople and criticized President Nixon's statements concerning peace as attempts to mislead world opinion.<br />\nOnly when the U.S. has withdrawn all its forces and<br />\nrespects the boundaries of Vietnam, Duan said, can peace<br />\nbe achieved. Until then the North Vietnamese will<br />\ncontinue to assume the burdens of war.<br />\nAmerican analysts viewed Duan's statement as a<br />\nfurther indication of Communist inflexibility for a war<br />\nsettlement. It confirmed their suspicious that North<br />\nVietnamese policy had hardened since the death of Ho<br />\nChi Minh.<br /><br />\nAntiwar Meeting<br />\nHigh school and college students involved in the antiwar movement will meet next weekend at Case Western<br />\nReserve University in Cleveland to discuss future plans.<br />\nThe Student Mobilization Committee, which will sponsor the two day conference, predicts it will be the largest<br />\nand most representative gathering of students yet held.<br />\nWorking with the New Mobilization Committee to End<br />\nthe War, the Mob played a large role in organizing the<br />\nOctober 15 Moratorium and the November 15 Marches<br />\non Washington and San Francisco.<br />\nDespite the popular support that Nixon Administration claims exists for its Vietnam policy, the Mob still<br />\nbelieves that the U.S. can be persuaded to withdraw all<br />\nits forces immediately, if the masses of citizens can be<br />\nmobilized effectively into action against the war.<br />\nA primary purpose of the meeting will be to alter<br />\nstrategy in the spring to comply with what appears to<br />\nbe the mood of the nation. This would indicate less<br />\nemphasis to be placed on large scale demonstrations<br />\nand more effort to organize and educate at local levels<br />\nin order to reach the \"Silent Americans.\"<br />\nIn addition to a large contingent of high school students<br />\nexpected to attend, adult peace groups have been invited<br />\nto send observers to further increase the representatives<br />\nof the conference.<br /><br />\nSignifigance Lies<br />\nThe significance of President Nixon's recently presented military budget lies in the policies it reflects as well<br />\nas the savings it achieves.<br />\nThe $11 billion military budget, reduced by $5.2<br />\nbillion from last year, represents the smallest share in<br />\nrelation to the overall federal budget allotted to the Defense Department in 20 years. Equally important, the<br />\nmeans of saving money and shifts in spending indicate<br />\nnew concepts in military approach.<br />\nA large portion of the savings will come from a reduction in manpower of over half a million men between<br />\nthis year's budget and the proposed one for next year.<br />\nA certain number of those men will be G.I.'s current-<br /><br />\nly serving in Vietnam who will be brought home over<br />\nthe next year as part of the President's troop withdrawal plan. Although the exact number has not been<br />\ndisclosed, observers estimate that the amount of money<br />\nto be saved indicates a planned reduction of an additional 126,000 troops during fiscal year 1971.<br />\nWhile reflecting a continued desire to keep troop<br />\nstrength low, enough forces are provided to handle<br />\none major and one minor war at a time, rather than<br />\nthe two major and one minor war theory of the past.<br />\nThe new theory will be geared to fighting a major war<br />\nin Europe, not Asia.<br />\nThe budget also reflects a decreasing reliance on<br />\nnon-nuclear weapons, with more emphasis on nuclear<br />\nweapons. An additional $1.5 billion is being sought to<br />\nexpand the ABM to deter a Chinese attack and more<br />\nfunds for the Minuteman system to prevent a Soviet '<br />\nattack. On an offensive basis, another $1 billion will<br />\nbe needed to convert six Polaris submarines to accomodate the Poseidon missile.<br />\nThe savings in military spending further indicate the<br />\nAdministration's desire to curb inflation and to also divert funds for domestic needs.<br /><br />\nDecadent Discs<br />\nA high Greek official has criticized the music of Western youth as \"decadent\" and urged government censorship on those artists who perform it.<br />\nIn dedication ceremonies at a music house this week in<br />\na southern port city, Ioarmis j_sadas, an army officer who<br />\nhelped plan the successful coup of 1967,declared that the<br />\nstate cannot allow the spread of music and art which will<br />\nfoster the corruption of society. Only artists wliose works<br />\nwill lead to the education of society should be condoned<br />\nby the government, according to Ladas.,<br />\nHe pointed with pride to the ancient Greeks who used<br />\nmusic to \"satisfy the sensitive requirements of the human<br />\nsoul\" and criticized those Greeks who would sacrifice<br />\ntraditional music for the \"degenerate music...composed by drugaddicted hippies.\" Whereas the folk music<br />\nglorified emotions and sentimentality, Ladas said that<br />\ncurrent music \"arouses and suggests whatever sensual<br />\nrot exists.\" Not since former Indonesian President<br />\nSukarno ordered the burning of all Beatle records<br />\nto<br />\nrid the nation of Western influence has current music<br />\ncaused such a stir among world leaders.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40381, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "53912f4b-11ee-420b-b020-f40697d33613", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14003-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14003, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "cf529338-0059-4b59-9f89-eb4a0e677fcb", "url": "/node/14003"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "bfc69ccb-aaed-4f75-a5e2-8c46c7fa1d07"}]}
