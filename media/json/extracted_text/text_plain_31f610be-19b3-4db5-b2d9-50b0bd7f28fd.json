The most<br />\nserious failing of my educational<br />\nbackground was that it didn't<br />\nreally prepare me for any<br />\ncommunity other than an<br />\nacademic one.\"<br />\nFrom Hopkins, Larry went to<br />\nBolivia as a rural community<br />\ndevelopment worker with the<br />\n<br />\nPeace Corps. After two years in<br />\nBolivia, he spent five months as<br />\na Peace Corps recruiter on<br />\ncollege campuses in the South.<br />\nIn 1967, draft legislation<br />\nprecluded his work with the<br />\nPeace Corps and his accepting<br />\nadmission to Union Seminary in<br />\nNew York.

Computers will obviously be<br />\nof great importance in the future. Over 250<br />\nundergraduates are involved in their courses this semester<br />\nas well as 60 Evening College students working for the new<br />\nMaster of Science degree. These students are depending on<br />\nthese courses for part of their education. But a commitment by the University for undefined financial responsibilities in the future would be indefensible with an unclear<br />\nfinancial future. This sort of planning has gotten the University into difficulties in the past.<br />\nThe one aspect of Dean Benton's decision that does<br />\nseem clearcut concerns the lack of public review or consultation before the decision was reached. The Academic<br />\nCouncil was consulted in this decision, but they chose to<br />\nconsider the evaluation of the program purely budgetary,<br />\ndespite the fact that the decision had the academic effect<br />\nof wiping out two new undergraduate programs. The decision was thus placed in Benton's hands.<br />\n<br />\nSAC fee<br />\nThe death by apathy of the rise in the student activity<br />\nfee, and the refusal by the administration to reconsider its<br />\nelimination of its subsidy of the student activities program,<br />\nbrings on something of a crisis in Hopkins life. Now nearly<br />\nunbearable, the creative and social environment on campus<br />\nwould travel even further downhill if the monetary<br />\nsituation does not improve. Having failed at getting the<br />\nundergraduates or the administration to foot the bill,<br />\nperhaps thet student leaders should look to another<br />\nalternative. There are other groups on campus besides the<br />\nundergraduates who benefit from student<br />\nactivities\u2014faculty and grad students get to pick up the<br />\nNews-Letter for free, they pay reduced rates at<br />\nBarnstormers plays and SC concerts, which are subsidized<br />\nby activity funds, as well as benefiting from the<br />\ninnumerable small groups and organizations around<br />\ncampus. Yet the undergraduate is forced to pay for all of<br />\nthese. And when the time comes for an increase, they ask<br />\nthe undergrads for more. Perhaps, instead, faculty and<br />\nparticularly graduate students could pay something for the<br />\nservices they receive. Of course these groups should not be<br />\nforced to pay as much as the undergraduates who now<br />\nshell out $25 each year. But it would seem fair to charge<br />\nthese groups $5 or $10 per annum, and it would go a long<br />\nway towards solving the current financial woes of student<br />\nactivities.<br />\n<br />\nThe Two-Nixon China Policy<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to take this<br />\nopportunity to commend you<br />\nfor your recent article on the<br />\nHopkins Honor System, which I<br />\nfound to be quite objective and<br />\nindeed necessary.

He held that their<br />\nprecepts were based on scarcity and therefore<br />\nwere inappropriate to the \"affluence\" in the U.S.<br />\n(The deepening poverty of the rest of the world,<br />\none had to presume, was unconnected to the<br />\nU.S., and was therefore relegated to one of the<br />\nmore obsolescent economics.) Sounding the call<br />\nfor a new economics of affluence, Galbraith<br />\ngained the reputation for being courageous,<br />\nhumane,and very liberal.<br />\nToday we find this humane,liberal economist<br />\nserving as the intellectual helpmeet to that<br />\nconservative misanthrope Richard Nixon.<br />\nConsider: 1) Galbraith called for wage-price<br />\ncontrols in early 1970. His affluence theory held<br />\nthat production and technology had been<br />\nincreasing throughout the sixties. The villainous<br />\nmodern corporations and powerful unions, with<br />\ntheir price setting and collective bargaining were<br />\ncausing runaway inflation. That the living<br />\nconditions of the union members, plus the<br />\nunorganized, unemployed and welfare victims,<br />\nhad been deteriorating steadily since the mid<br />\nsixties, Galbraith's ideological blinders did not<br />\npermit him to see.<br />\nThus at a time when the economic question<br />\nbefore the U.S. and the world is how to reverse<br />\ndeterioration and effect a qualitative<br />\nimprovement in life (i.e. how to expand socially<br />\nuseful production), Galbraith ignores humanity<br />\nand makes a proposal to further reduce the living<br />\nstandard of workers, unemployed and oppressed<br />\nminorities.

Courageously making a turn towards<br />\npoverty, he and two MIT economists issued \"The<br />\nGalbraith Plan to Promote the Minorities.\" It\u2014<br />\nthe Minorities Advancement Plan (MAP)\u2014 calls<br />\nfor legislation to enforce percentages of women,<br />\nblack and Spanish-speaking personnel in<br />\nprofessional and executive salary brackets in<br />\nindustry and government. In fact, it is an<br />\nextension of Nixon's Philadelphia Plan\u2014 the use<br />\nof minority hiring quotas in construction trade<br />\nunions as a way to pit one group of workers<br />\nM. Merry is a member of the Baltimore Labor<br />\nCommittee.<br />\n<br />\nM. Merry<br />\n<br />\nagainst another in order to divert attention from<br />\nthe fact that the total number of jobs is<br />\ndeclining. As a result of it race wars broke out in<br />\nPittsburgh and other cities in 1969. Galbraith<br />\nfeels that the Philadelphia Plan in construction<br />\nand other industries will work all the better if the<br />\nwhite worker knows that the white executive is<br />\nhaving his troubles too with women, blacks, and<br />\nSpanish minorities. Of course, Nixon is not now<br />\npolitically prepared to go so far as this in his<br />\ndivide and conquer \"civil rights\" proposals. It<br />\nrequires a mind more astute\u2014 like Hitler's\u2014 to<br />\nappreciate the longer range efficacy of blurring<br />\nclass lines to focus the working majority's fear of<br />\nloss ofjobs and living standards on the minority's<br />\nstruggle for decent jobs and living standards.<br />\nProto-Fascist<br />\nWhat is it about Galbraith's thinking that<br />\nmakes his ideas so compatible with Nixon's and<br />\nwith proto-fascist tendencies in general?<br />\nBeing a true empiricist, JKG believes a fact is a<br />\nfact. In 1958 he assembled a bunch of facts on<br />\nthe U.S. economy. In good common sense\u2014 first<br />\nthings first tradition, he turned his back on<br />\n\"facts\" about the rest of the world and set out to<br />\nbuild a new economics to comprehend his own<br />\n\"affluent\" back yard. As it happened at the end<br />\nof the fifties there ceased to be any significant<br />\nincrease in the real production of the U.S. Of<br />\ncourse Galbraith's backyard facts showed<br />\notherwise, i.e. the GNP was high and rising. And<br />\nempiricist that he is, he could hardly have seen<br />\nthe wave of student and black radicalization in<br />\nthe early sixties as having anything to do with<br />\nthe decline of socially useful growth in the<br />\neconomy. After the mid-sixties when real gro it<br />\nin Europe and Japan began to<br />\nw down, the<br />\nprops on the dollar hogan sl' \u2022ng. Galbr:iith<br />\nfound inflation growing in las back yard;<br />\nideologically he knew the cause could not be far<br />\naway. It couldn't be lack of production or<br />\ntechnology\u2014 his senses, the GNP and his<br />\naffluence economics all told him otherwise. Of<br />\ncourse. The trouble must lay in the big<br />\ncorporations and powerful trade unions. Harness<br />\nthem with wage-price controls and inflation will<br />\nbe cured.<br />\nToward the end of the sixties, Galbraith began<br />\nto see such an increase in national production as<br />\nlikely to cause a 1929 style crash. His analysis of<br />\n1929 is that an increase in national product<br />\nresults in a self-destroying speculative boom.<br />\nIndeed, on the subject of depression, Galbraith is<br />\non to something. However, a depressis imminent,<br />\nnot because of production increasing, but<br />\nbecause of the increase in paper claims\u2014 stocks,<br />\nrents, debt service\u2014 on the real social use value<br />\nof existing production.<br />\n(continued on page 10)<br />\n<br />\n\fNov. 5, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nbeasts and children<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\nStanley Kramer is generally<br />\nregarded as one of Hollywood's<br />\nmore controversial film-makers.<br />\nHis past credits are impressive,<br />\nand include such<br />\n\"socially-concerned\" films as:<br />\nDEATH OF A SALESMAN,<br />\nHIGH NOON, THE WILD ONE,<br />\nTHE CAINE MUTINY, ON<br />\nTHE BEACH, INHERIT THE<br />\nWIND, JUDGMENT AT<br />\nNUREMBERG, SHIP OF<br />\nFOOLS, and GUESS WHO'S<br />\nCOMING TO DINNER, which<br />\nprovided the late Spencer Tracy<br />\nWith his \"grand finale.\"<br />\nKramer's latest film, which he<br />\nproduced and directed is based<br />\non a novel called \"Bless the<br />\nBeasts and Children,\" by<br />\nGlendon Swarthout. The author<br />\nlives in Arizona, and the setting<br />\nis at a boy's camp in his home<br />\nstate. The novel essentially deals<br />\nWith the growth and maturation,<br />\nor lack thereof, of six boys who<br />\nare placed in the same cabin<br />\nmainly because they all suffer<br />\nfrom emotional problems but<br />\nalso because they are utterly<br />\ninept at outdoor sports, the<br />\nmainstay of the camp's program.<br />\nThe sign over the entrance to<br />\nthe camp reads: \"BOX<br />\nCANYON BOY'S CAMP: Send<br />\nus a boy\u2014we'll send you a<br />\ncowboy.\" The filming was done<br />\nat the Hidden Valley ranch<br />\nsouth of Prescott, Arizona, in<br />\nthe town itself (which is known<br />\nas \"the cowboy capital of the<br />\nworld\"), and on Santa Catalina<br />\nIsland, where a herd of 400<br />\nbuffalo roam.<br />\nIn 1925, 19 of them were<br />\nbrought to the Island to film<br />\nTHE VANISHING AMERICAN,<br />\nfrom which Kramer took some<br />\nof the shooting scenes, and they<br />\nhave since multiplied.<br />\nBuffalo Thinned<br />\nThe film recounts the<br />\n<br />\nadventures of these six boys as<br />\nthey try to save a herd of<br />\nbuffalo from being \"thinned\" by<br />\nshooting some of them in a<br />\nfenced pasture.<br />\nThis is a process actually in<br />\nuse by the Arizona Game and<br />\nFish Department on their<br />\n15,000 acre Raymond Ranch<br />\ngame preserve. Every year, the<br />\nstate holds a lottery to see who<br />\ngets to shoot the buffalo. In<br />\n1970, 80 were destined to be<br />\nkilled, and 474 hunters applied.<br />\nFor $45, the gunner may fire at<br />\nthe doomed herd from a \u2022<br />\ndistance of 10 to 50 yards. He<br />\nmay keep the head, hide and<br />\nfront quarter of \"his\" buffalo,<br />\nwith the remaining meat being<br />\nsold to the public.<br />\nIn the film, this hunt is the<br />\ncatalyzing incident. When the six<br />\nboys are taken to see it by their<br />\ncounselor, who himself is one of<br />\nthe gunners, they are totally<br />\nrepulsed by their experience and<br />\nthey resolve to come back and<br />\n\u2022 free the rest of the1 buffalo.<br />\nOne night, they sneak out of<br />\ntheir cabin, with the help of a<br />\nheadset radio given to Wheaties,<br />\ntheir counselor, who keeps it on<br />\nwhile he sleeps. The boys steal<br />\nsome camp horses, and ride<br />\naway. Dawn finds them<br />\ncantering across the beautiful<br />\nsouthwestern countryside, and<br />\nafter abandoning their horses<br />\nand walking for a stretch, they<br />\nsteal an old extermination<br />\ncompany jeep. It carries a very<br />\napropos red flag with an upside<br />\ndown bug and the words\u2014\"we<br />\nkill 'em dead.\"<br />\nKramer reveals the emotional<br />\ndisturbances in the boys' pasts<br />\nby a series of flashbacks, some<br />\nof which are very funny, while<br />\nothers border on farce, as in<br />\nLally 2's gluttonous gobbling of<br />\na huge dish of candy in about 20<br />\nseconds in the psychiatrist's<br />\noffice.<br />\n<br />\n<\u2022\u2022'<br />\n<br />\nThe film is generally quite<br />\nfunny, but these slips from<br />\ncomedy into farce are<br />\ninstrumental in weakening<br />\nsomewhat the force of the social<br />\ncomment which is the strong<br />\npoint of BLESS THE BEASTS.<br />\nSwarthout, the author of the<br />\nnovel, said: \"I never believed<br />\nthat Bless the Beasts and<br />\nChildren could be a motion<br />\npicture. It was a book about<br />\nbedeviled boys and great,<br />\nungovernable animals, and no<br />\nman, I thought, could gentle<br />\nthem to his will. It has two<br />\nthemes: that all living things are<br />\nkin, and that by freeing others<br />\nwe free ourselves.\"<br />\nThe opening scene of the film<br />\nwas symbolic of this theme:<br />\nCotton, the son of a colonel and<br />\na not so young anymore socialite<br />\nwho are divorced, has a<br />\nnightmare in which he and the<br />\nfive boys are prodded out of a<br />\npen and shot by their own<br />\nparents. An effective equation of<br />\nthe beasts and the children.<br />\nThe end serves to illustrate<br />\nthe same opposition to violence<br />\nwhich Kramer clearly feels; after<br />\nthe boys have succeeded in<br />\n<br />\nAtaN17,<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n.1.<br />\n<br />\ntearing open the pastine gate,<br />\nwith the help of a stolen truck,<br />\nthe eager hunters wake up,<br />\nhorrified at the sound of<br />\nstampeding buffalo, and form a<br />\nposse to see what's going on. As<br />\nthey emerge over the hill, and<br />\ndrive down toward the pen, they<br />\nfind the buffalo peacefully<br />\ngrazing, out in the open fields;<br />\nmeanwhile, the boys are<br />\nhysterical because the buffalo<br />\nare not escaping, and Cotton<br />\njumps in the truck and drives<br />\ntowards them trying to scare<br />\nthem off. The hunters attempt<br />\nto stop him by shooting at the<br />\ntruck's tires, but accidentally(?),<br />\nthey hit Cotton instead.

The<br />\nArizona landscapes are done<br />\nwell; the interior work is<br />\nmediocre, and the highlight is<br />\nthe slow-motion gallop to the<br />\ntune \"Bless the Beasts\" (fairly<br />\nwell-done, by the Carpenters)<br />\nduring the title scene.<br />\nIt is a credit to Kramer,<br />\nthough one to be expected, that<br />\nhe used footage from an old film<br />\nfor the buffalo-shooting scenes.<br />\nBless the Beasts<br />\nThe Arizona Game<br />\nDepartment refused him<br />\npermission to shoot one of their<br />\nactual massacres. The film also,<br />\ncaused some stir at the National<br />\nRifle Association, and they sent<br />\nout letters to all their members<br />\nadvising them to boycott the<br />\nfilm.<br />\nBless the Beasts received<br />\ncritical acclaim at the 1971<br />\nMoscow Film Festival, and poet<br />\nYevgeny Yevtushenko wrote<br />\nKramer: \"Your film teaches all<br />\nof us kindness and the humanity<br />\ninside humanity.\" Kramer has<br />\ndone a fine job of expressing his<br />\nfeelings about inhumanity and<br />\nviolence, particularly among the<br />\ngun cult, and, though the film is<br />\noverdone in parts, it deserves<br />\nacclaim.<br />\n<br />\nbeach boys<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nThere is a phenomenon in the<br />\nworld of rock music that if you<br />\nstay around long enough,<br />\nkeeping basically the same<br />\npersonnel, avoiding absorption<br />\ninto the straight media, and<br />\nmaking some sort of musical<br />\nprogression, then you will<br />\nbecome a supergroup. This sort<br />\nof thing happened to the Who,<br />\nand some say it is happening to<br />\nthe Beach Boys.<br />\n\"What do they mean to me?<br />\nThey generally mean what they<br />\nused to do. You know, their old<br />\nmusic.\"<br />\nSome others say the Beach<br />\nBoys have been of supergroup<br />\nstatus all along, but when their<br />\nSgt.

Sure they could sing, but<br />\nit was probably just a bunch of<br />\nrecording tricks.<br />\nAll the while the harmonies<br />\nwere real and their complexity<br />\nwent unnoticed.

But just keep playing<br />\nit and maybe once, when you're<br />\nreally tired, you'll put it on and<br />\nwon't have enough energy to<br />\nlisten to the songs and you'll<br />\nhear the music and you'll<br />\nwonder how Brian Wilson could<br />\nhave known to have that<br />\nparticular voice come in right<br />\nthere and sing precisely that<br />\nnote, counterpointing both in<br />\nrythm and pitch of the<br />\ncontinuous melody, the two<br />\nfinally perhaps blending<br />\ntogether.<br />\n\"Mean to me?

The new<br />\nbureaucracy has an annual<br />\nbudget of around $140 million,<br />\n1,500 full-time employees and<br />\nroughly 49,000 volunteers. The<br />\nNixon administration is also<br />\nseeking Congressional approval<br />\nto incorporate HEWs Teacher<br />\nCorps into the agency, as well as<br />\nan additional $20 million to<br />\nfund experiments with new ways<br />\nto use volunteers. ACTION's<br />\nhead is Joseph H. Blatchford,<br />\nformer director of the Peace<br />\nCorps.<br />\nSome of the groups welded<br />\ninto the new agency charged<br />\nthat the merger proposal was a<br />\nmove away from social action, as<br />\nwell as being too vague and<br />\ninefficient. Prior to submitting<br />\nthe reorganization plan to<br />\nCongress on March 24, the<br />\nNixon administration was also<br />\nwracked by sharp disagreements<br />\nbetween Peace Corps and VISTA<br />\nofficials over the shape of the<br />\nnew agency's programs.<br />\nMajor opposition to the<br />\nformation of ACTION came<br />\nfrom the 4,800 VISTA<br />\nvolunteers who work with the<br />\npoor in such areas as economic<br />\ndevelopment, manpower, social<br />\nservice, law, housing and<br />\ncommunity planning.<br />\nThe Nixon administration had<br />\nbegun last spring to shift the<br />\nfocus of VISTA work away from<br />\ncommunity organizing\u2014which<br />\nhad often placed volunteers at<br />\nodds with local governments\u2014to<br />\nmore nonpolitical social services.<br />\nThe Office of Economic<br />\nOp portunity(0E0), which<br />\noversees VISTA, also began<br />\nrecruiting older volunteers with<br />\nspecialized skills rather than<br />\nyoung generalists, in addition to<br />\n<br />\nending the practice of<br />\nrecommending draft deferments<br />\nfor VISTA volunteers.<br />\nDocuments<br />\nVolunteer opposition to the<br />\nnew agency was spearheaded by<br />\nthe National VISTA Alliance,<br />\nwith its 2,000 dues-paying<br />\nmembers. NVA leaders<br />\ncontended that the<br />\nadministration was bent on<br />\nweakening VISTA and<br />\n<br />\nsupport for the program.<br />\nFinal Decision<br />\nBlatchford and other<br />\nadministration officials noted,<br />\nhowever, that VISTA was indeed<br />\nbeing funded for fiscal year<br />\n1972. Opponents asserted that<br />\nthis was only because the<br />\ndamaging documents were<br />\nleaked to the press. But as<br />\nBlatchford told student press<br />\nrepresentatives Wednesday, \"It's<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\ndismantling 0E0. Merger critics<br />\npointed to a number of<br />\nadministration documents and<br />\nmoves which they said showed<br />\n\"an attitude of neglect\" towards<br />\nVISTA.<br />\nThey noted, for example, that<br />\nJohn Wilson, an 0E0 planning<br />\nofficer, wrote in a January, 1971<br />\nmemo that it would be<br />\n\"politically\" unwise to end<br />\nVISTA abruptly. He said that<br />\nVISTA should be cut \"in the<br />\ncontext of a much broader<br />\ngovernment reorganization in<br />\nwhich both VISTA and the<br />\nPeace Corps be eliminated for a<br />\ntotal savings of $131 million.\" A<br />\ndocument introduced during<br />\nMay hearings before a<br />\nCongressional subcommitteee<br />\nfurther worried VISTA<br />\nsupporters: a galley proof of<br />\n0E0's fiscal 1972 budget, dated<br />\nDec. 30, 1970, which showed no<br />\nmoney allocated for VISTA.<br />\nLast year, 0E0 officials also<br />\ncirculated among Congressmen a<br />\nchart that showed that VISTA<br />\nhad two percent of Federal<br />\nanti-poverty personnel, 12<br />\npercent of 0E0 money and 24<br />\npercent of Congressional<br />\ncomplaints and inquiries\u2014a<br />\nmove not aimed at encouraging<br />\n<br />\nthe final decision that counts.\"<br />\nIn a November report on<br />\nACTION since its July 1<br />\nformation, Blatchford added,<br />\n\"ACTION brought together<br />\nfrom throughout the federal<br />\ngovernment volunteer service<br />\nprograms whose purposes and<br />\nspirit remain intact, but whose<br />\ngoals and effectiveness are being<br />\nsharpened and expanded to<br />\nbetter deal with the pressing<br />\nsocial requirements of the<br />\n1970's.\"<br />\nNVA representatives charged,<br />\nthough, \"The emphasis of the<br />\nnew agency seems to be away<br />\nfrom actively working in poverty<br />\ncommunities.\"<br />\nThe Nixon administration,<br />\ntoo, seems concerned about the<br />\npolitical activities and beliefs of<br />\nVISTA volunteers. The New<br />\nYork Times quoted a<br />\nRepublican offical as referring to<br />\nVISTA as a \"post-graduate<br />\nhate-Nixon program.\"<br />\nRadicals?<br />\nVISTA has sponsored at least<br />\ntwo internal studies to examine<br />\nthis controversial area. One<br />\nstudy, conducted by Prof. David<br />\nGottleib of Penn State<br />\nUniversity, revealed that<br />\none-third of VISTA volunteers<br />\n<br />\nwere sharply \"radicalized\" by<br />\ntheir service, while most others<br />\nwere moved left in their political<br />\nbeliefs. Another study,<br />\nconducted in 1970, asserted that<br />\nthe greater the incidence of<br />\nvolunteer involvement in<br />\ncommunity organizing, \"the<br />\nmore prone the project is to<br />\nconflict.\" The head of the study,<br />\nJohn Shaffer, said that \"VISTA<br />\nvolunteers are causing too much<br />\nunwarranted and unnecessary<br />\nflak.\"<br />\nBlatchford also responded in<br />\nthe Wednesday interview to<br />\ncriticisms of the administration<br />\nhandling of VISTA. \"Those<br />\ncharges had no validity then and<br />\nI don't think they have any<br />\nnow,\" he said. \"There is no<br />\npolitical screening of candidates.<br />\nAll these debates, studies,<br />\ncomments have no relevancy to<br />\nmy job.\"<br />\nOther criticisms aimed at the<br />\nnew agency were that the<br />\nmerged groups had little in<br />\ncommon and that ACTION's<br />\nstructure was poorly defined.<br />\nBut Blanchford said<br />\nWednesday,\"ACTION is an idea<br />\nwhose time has come.\" He<br />\nadded, \"We can respond<br />\nanywhere in 60 countries, 50<br />\nstates and four territories.\"<br />\nAdministration officials also<br />\nde fended the agency's<br />\norganization, claiming that it<br />\nwould give individual agencies<br />\ngreater visibility and make<br />\nevaluation of volunteer programs<br />\neasier. In addition, they asserted<br />\nthat the new agency would<br />\nimprove recruitment, selection<br />\nand training programs, as well as<br />\nsimplify operation.<br />\nOther government volunteer<br />\ngroups beside the Peace Corps<br />\nand VISTA were involved in the<br />\nmerger. Two HEW programs for<br />\nthe elderly under the<br />\nAdministration on Aging were<br />\nshifted to ACTION, including<br />\nthe $10.5 million Foster<br />\nGrandparents Program, which<br />\nprovides 4,200 senior citizens<br />\nthe chance to work part time<br />\nwith children. According to one<br />\nMaryland-based worker with the<br />\nelderly, Hopkins grad student<br />\nMike Greco, this program will be<br />\nphased out by ACTION next<br />\n<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe Small Business<br />\nAdministration gave up two<br />\nprograms under which<br />\nestablished or retired<br />\nbusinessmen provide advice to<br />\nsmall firms. Volunteers and<br />\nsupporters of both the elderly<br />\nand business programs opposed<br />\nthe merger. They feared<br />\ndowngrading of the programs,<br />\nand, according to Greco,<br />\nACTION has already begun<br />\ncurtailing these programs.<br />\nPlans for the volunteer agency<br />\nwere first announced publicly by<br />\nNixon in a January 14 speech at<br />\nthe University of Nebraska. He<br />\ntold 9,000 student and faculty<br />\nmembers that he would propose<br />\n\"a new volunteer service corps<br />\nthat will give young Americans<br />\nan expanded opportunity for the<br />\nservice they want to give ...\"<br />\nThe decision to form the new<br />\nagency, though, was formed in<br />\nthe fall of 1970 during a review<br />\nof fiscal 1972 budget proposals.<br />\nA policy group was set up by<br />\nGeorge Schulz of the Office of<br />\nManagement and Budget<br />\nconsisting of various agency reps<br />\nto lay the groundwork for the<br />\nreorganization. This policy<br />\ngroup was later joined by a task<br />\nforce to detail the new agency,<br />\naiming for a March 1, 1971<br />\ndeadline.<br />\nBut bickering between the<br />\nPeace Corps and VISTA was so<br />\nintense that they missed the<br />\ndeadline, and the White House<br />\nmerely submitted a vague<br />\noutline of the agency, based on a<br />\nPeace Corps draft alone, which<br />\nonly listed the agencies to be<br />\nconsolidated.<br />\nBecause of the vagueness of<br />\nthe plan, another task force was<br />\nset up in April, to prep officials<br />\nfor Congressional hearings and<br />\ndevelop, # new organizational<br />\nsystem for ACTION.<br />\nAdministration lobbying<br />\noverpowered opponents of the<br />\nagency, and two key committees<br />\nand finally both Houses of<br />\nCongress backed the agency by<br />\nJune.

The<br />\nCoach called Hopkins'<br />\nperformance \"the best game I've<br />\nseen at Hopkins in three years.<br />\nThere were no fumbles and only<br />\none interception.\"<br />\nCox praised his charges for<br />\nshowing \"poise and stamina\"<br />\nmidway through the second<br />\nperiod when the Blue Jays,<br />\ntrailing 7-0, failed to run the ball<br />\nover the goal line on four tries<br />\nfrom inside the four. Such a<br />\nletdown could have provided an<br />\nexcuse for the team to roll over,<br />\nbut Hopkins instead continued<br />\nto play aggressively.

The Garnets<br />\nhave been averaging 320 yards in<br />\ntotal offense per game, 200 of<br />\nthem on the ground. The attack<br />\nis led by Dave Bloom, the<br />\nsecond leading runner in the<br />\nMAC who has olled up 416<br />\nyards in 110 carries, and with 32<br />\npoints ranks as the leading scorer<br />\nin the conference.<br />\nWhy an 0-5 mark with so<br />\nmuch offense? \"They've lost<br />\nmost of their games in the<br />\nfourth quarter,\" answers Cox.<br />\n\"which reflects a lack of depth.\"<br />\nThe Garnets have one of the<br />\nsmaller squads in the MAC,with<br />\nonly about thirty players on<br />\ntheir roster.

Most people call him<br />\njust Larry: Mr. Steams would<br />\nsomehow sound inappropriate.<br />\nThrough the drift of a<br />\nconversation his answers are<br />\nalways thoughtful, and his<br /><br />\nsincere openness is conveyed by<br />\nhis eyes as well as his words.<br />\nQuoting him seems a little<br />\nunfair, for his answers are long<br />\nwith concern for a better<br />\nunderstanding, and quotes are at<br />\nbest a summary.<br />\nWhile open and honest, there<br />\nis also a reserve about Larry, a<br />\nkind of secretiveness. He is a<br />\nquiet person. He smiles easily<br />\nbut does not often laugh. He was<br />\na clown at the Halloween party<br />\nin Levering last weekend,<br />\ncomplete with white face and<br />\ncomic pantomime. He said he<br />\nenjoyed being a clown; he had<br />\nnever been one before.<br />\nLarry graduated from<br />\nHopkins with a Liberal Arts<br />\ndegree in 1965. He concentrated<br />\nin Philosophy and specifically in<br />\nEthics. Of his undergraduate<br />\nwork at Hopkins, Larry says,<br />\n\"We studied ethics, but in no<br />\nmeaningful way considered the<br />\napplications of ethical decisions<br />\noutside an intellectual or<br />\nacademic framework. The most<br />\nserious failing of my educational<br />\nbackground was that it didn't<br />\nreally prepare me for any<br />\ncommunity other than an<br />\nacademic one.\"<br />\nFrom Hopkins, Larry went to<br />\nBolivia as a rural community<br />\ndevelopment worker with the<br /><br />\nPeace Corps. After two years in<br />\nBolivia, he spent five months as<br />\na Peace Corps recruiter on<br />\ncollege campuses in the South.<br />\nIn 1967, draft legislation<br />\nprecluded his work with the<br />\nPeace Corps and his accepting<br />\nadmission to Union Seminary in<br />\nNew York.

President Nixon<br />\nis adamant, that \"differences<br />\nmust be settled by the Arab<br />\nnations and Israel and not by the<br />\nsuper powers,\" he said.<br />\nSisco cited two primary<br />\nfactors responsible in delaying a<br />\ntemporary settlement; the<br />\nmistrust between the Arabs and<br />\nIsraelis, and the \"constant<br />\nspecter of confrontation<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nbetween the superpowers.\"<br />\nSisco maintained since both<br />\nsides share a parallel interest in<br />\navoiding con flict between the U.S.<br />\nand Russia, \"it ought to be<br />\npossible to work out pragmatic<br />\ncompromises.\"<br />\n\"Not only has Egypt<br />\nexpressed a desire to sign a peace<br />\nagreement,\" he asserted, \"but<br />\nalso the Sadat government is<br />\nmore concerned with internal<br />\ndevelopment than external<br />\nexpansion.\"<br /><br />\nJoseph Sisco<br /><br />\nBy BILL WITTING<br />\nTaking advantage of the<br />\nRussia theme of this year's<br />\nMilton S.

Computers will obviously be<br />\nof great importance in the future. Over 250<br />\nundergraduates are involved in their courses this semester<br />\nas well as 60 Evening College students working for the new<br />\nMaster of Science degree. These students are depending on<br />\nthese courses for part of their education. But a commitment by the University for undefined financial responsibilities in the future would be indefensible with an unclear<br />\nfinancial future. This sort of planning has gotten the University into difficulties in the past.<br />\nThe one aspect of Dean Benton's decision that does<br />\nseem clearcut concerns the lack of public review or consultation before the decision was reached. The Academic<br />\nCouncil was consulted in this decision, but they chose to<br />\nconsider the evaluation of the program purely budgetary,<br />\ndespite the fact that the decision had the academic effect<br />\nof wiping out two new undergraduate programs. The decision was thus placed in Benton's hands.<br /><br />\nSAC fee<br />\nThe death by apathy of the rise in the student activity<br />\nfee, and the refusal by the administration to reconsider its<br />\nelimination of its subsidy of the student activities program,<br />\nbrings on something of a crisis in Hopkins life. Now nearly<br />\nunbearable, the creative and social environment on campus<br />\nwould travel even further downhill if the monetary<br />\nsituation does not improve. Having failed at getting the<br />\nundergraduates or the administration to foot the bill,<br />\nperhaps thet student leaders should look to another<br />\nalternative. There are other groups on campus besides the<br />\nundergraduates who benefit from student<br />\nactivities\u2014faculty and grad students get to pick up the<br />\nNews-Letter for free, they pay reduced rates at<br />\nBarnstormers plays and SC concerts, which are subsidized<br />\nby activity funds, as well as benefiting from the<br />\ninnumerable small groups and organizations around<br />\ncampus. Yet the undergraduate is forced to pay for all of<br />\nthese. And when the time comes for an increase, they ask<br />\nthe undergrads for more. Perhaps, instead, faculty and<br />\nparticularly graduate students could pay something for the<br />\nservices they receive. Of course these groups should not be<br />\nforced to pay as much as the undergraduates who now<br />\nshell out $25 each year. But it would seem fair to charge<br />\nthese groups $5 or $10 per annum, and it would go a long<br />\nway towards solving the current financial woes of student<br />\nactivities.<br /><br />\nThe Two-Nixon China Policy<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to take this<br />\nopportunity to commend you<br />\nfor your recent article on the<br />\nHopkins Honor System, which I<br />\nfound to be quite objective and<br />\nindeed necessary.

He held that their<br />\nprecepts were based on scarcity and therefore<br />\nwere inappropriate to the \"affluence\" in the U.S.<br />\n(The deepening poverty of the rest of the world,<br />\none had to presume, was unconnected to the<br />\nU.S., and was therefore relegated to one of the<br />\nmore obsolescent economics.) Sounding the call<br />\nfor a new economics of affluence, Galbraith<br />\ngained the reputation for being courageous,<br />\nhumane,and very liberal.<br />\nToday we find this humane,liberal economist<br />\nserving as the intellectual helpmeet to that<br />\nconservative misanthrope Richard Nixon.<br />\nConsider: 1) Galbraith called for wage-price<br />\ncontrols in early 1970. His affluence theory held<br />\nthat production and technology had been<br />\nincreasing throughout the sixties. The villainous<br />\nmodern corporations and powerful unions, with<br />\ntheir price setting and collective bargaining were<br />\ncausing runaway inflation. That the living<br />\nconditions of the union members, plus the<br />\nunorganized, unemployed and welfare victims,<br />\nhad been deteriorating steadily since the mid<br />\nsixties, Galbraith's ideological blinders did not<br />\npermit him to see.<br />\nThus at a time when the economic question<br />\nbefore the U.S. and the world is how to reverse<br />\ndeterioration and effect a qualitative<br />\nimprovement in life (i.e. how to expand socially<br />\nuseful production), Galbraith ignores humanity<br />\nand makes a proposal to further reduce the living<br />\nstandard of workers, unemployed and oppressed<br />\nminorities. He refuses to face questions of what<br />\nis produced, how and for whom, in favor of<br />\nfiguring how to buy time for the collapsing world<br />\nfinancial system by any anti-human means<br />\nnecessary.<br />\nEmbarrassing<br />\n2.)When Nixon followed Galbraith's lead on<br />\nAug. 15, the new economics of affluence might<br />\nhave become a trifle too embarrassing for<br />\nGalbraith. Courageously making a turn towards<br />\npoverty, he and two MIT economists issued \"The<br />\nGalbraith Plan to Promote the Minorities.\" It\u2014<br />\nthe Minorities Advancement Plan (MAP)\u2014 calls<br />\nfor legislation to enforce percentages of women,<br />\nblack and Spanish-speaking personnel in<br />\nprofessional and executive salary brackets in<br />\nindustry and government. In fact, it is an<br />\nextension of Nixon's Philadelphia Plan\u2014 the use<br />\nof minority hiring quotas in construction trade<br />\nunions as a way to pit one group of workers<br />\nM. Merry is a member of the Baltimore Labor<br />\nCommittee.<br /><br />\nM. Merry<br /><br />\nagainst another in order to divert attention from<br />\nthe fact that the total number of jobs is<br />\ndeclining. As a result of it race wars broke out in<br />\nPittsburgh and other cities in 1969. Galbraith<br />\nfeels that the Philadelphia Plan in construction<br />\nand other industries will work all the better if the<br />\nwhite worker knows that the white executive is<br />\nhaving his troubles too with women, blacks, and<br />\nSpanish minorities. Of course, Nixon is not now<br />\npolitically prepared to go so far as this in his<br />\ndivide and conquer \"civil rights\" proposals. It<br />\nrequires a mind more astute\u2014 like Hitler's\u2014 to<br />\nappreciate the longer range efficacy of blurring<br />\nclass lines to focus the working majority's fear of<br />\nloss ofjobs and living standards on the minority's<br />\nstruggle for decent jobs and living standards.<br />\nProto-Fascist<br />\nWhat is it about Galbraith's thinking that<br />\nmakes his ideas so compatible with Nixon's and<br />\nwith proto-fascist tendencies in general?<br />\nBeing a true empiricist, JKG believes a fact is a<br />\nfact. In 1958 he assembled a bunch of facts on<br />\nthe U.S. economy. In good common sense\u2014 first<br />\nthings first tradition, he turned his back on<br />\n\"facts\" about the rest of the world and set out to<br />\nbuild a new economics to comprehend his own<br />\n\"affluent\" back yard. As it happened at the end<br />\nof the fifties there ceased to be any significant<br />\nincrease in the real production of the U.S. Of<br />\ncourse Galbraith's backyard facts showed<br />\notherwise, i.e. the GNP was high and rising. And<br />\nempiricist that he is, he could hardly have seen<br />\nthe wave of student and black radicalization in<br />\nthe early sixties as having anything to do with<br />\nthe decline of socially useful growth in the<br />\neconomy. After the mid-sixties when real gro it<br />\nin Europe and Japan began to<br />\nw down, the<br />\nprops on the dollar hogan sl' \u2022ng. Galbr:iith<br />\nfound inflation growing in las back yard;<br />\nideologically he knew the cause could not be far<br />\naway. It couldn't be lack of production or<br />\ntechnology\u2014 his senses, the GNP and his<br />\naffluence economics all told him otherwise. Of<br />\ncourse. The trouble must lay in the big<br />\ncorporations and powerful trade unions. Harness<br />\nthem with wage-price controls and inflation will<br />\nbe cured.<br />\nToward the end of the sixties, Galbraith began<br />\nto see such an increase in national production as<br />\nlikely to cause a 1929 style crash. His analysis of<br />\n1929 is that an increase in national product<br />\nresults in a self-destroying speculative boom.<br />\nIndeed, on the subject of depression, Galbraith is<br />\non to something. However, a depressis imminent,<br />\nnot because of production increasing, but<br />\nbecause of the increase in paper claims\u2014 stocks,<br />\nrents, debt service\u2014 on the real social use value<br />\nof existing production.<br />\n(continued on page 10)<br /><br />\nNov. 5, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nbeasts and children<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\nStanley Kramer is generally<br />\nregarded as one of Hollywood's<br />\nmore controversial film-makers.<br />\nHis past credits are impressive,<br />\nand include such<br />\n\"socially-concerned\" films as:<br />\nDEATH OF A SALESMAN,<br />\nHIGH NOON, THE WILD ONE,<br />\nTHE CAINE MUTINY, ON<br />\nTHE BEACH, INHERIT THE<br />\nWIND, JUDGMENT AT<br />\nNUREMBERG, SHIP OF<br />\nFOOLS, and GUESS WHO'S<br />\nCOMING TO DINNER, which<br />\nprovided the late Spencer Tracy<br />\nWith his \"grand finale.\"<br />\nKramer's latest film, which he<br />\nproduced and directed is based<br />\non a novel called \"Bless the<br />\nBeasts and Children,\" by<br />\nGlendon Swarthout. The author<br />\nlives in Arizona, and the setting<br />\nis at a boy's camp in his home<br />\nstate.

It has two<br />\nthemes: that all living things are<br />\nkin, and that by freeing others<br />\nwe free ourselves.\"<br />\nThe opening scene of the film<br />\nwas symbolic of this theme:<br />\nCotton, the son of a colonel and<br />\na not so young anymore socialite<br />\nwho are divorced, has a<br />\nnightmare in which he and the<br />\nfive boys are prodded out of a<br />\npen and shot by their own<br />\nparents. An effective equation of<br />\nthe beasts and the children.<br />\nThe end serves to illustrate<br />\nthe same opposition to violence<br />\nwhich Kramer clearly feels; after<br />\nthe boys have succeeded in<br /><br />\nAtaN17,<br />\n*<br /><br />\n.1.<br /><br />\ntearing open the pastine gate,<br />\nwith the help of a stolen truck,<br />\nthe eager hunters wake up,<br />\nhorrified at the sound of<br />\nstampeding buffalo, and form a<br />\nposse to see what's going on.

This sort<br />\nof thing happened to the Who,<br />\nand some say it is happening to<br />\nthe Beach Boys.<br />\n\"What do they mean to me?<br />\nThey generally mean what they<br />\nused to do. You know, their old<br />\nmusic.\"<br />\nSome others say the Beach<br />\nBoys have been of supergroup<br />\nstatus all along, but when their<br />\nSgt.

But just keep playing<br />\nit and maybe once, when you're<br />\nreally tired, you'll put it on and<br />\nwon't have enough energy to<br />\nlisten to the songs and you'll<br />\nhear the music and you'll<br />\nwonder how Brian Wilson could<br />\nhave known to have that<br />\nparticular voice come in right<br />\nthere and sing precisely that<br />\nnote, counterpointing both in<br />\nrythm and pitch of the<br />\ncontinuous melody, the two<br />\nfinally perhaps blending<br />\ntogether.<br />\n\"Mean to me?

The new<br />\nbureaucracy has an annual<br />\nbudget of around $140 million,<br />\n1,500 full-time employees and<br />\nroughly 49,000 volunteers. The<br />\nNixon administration is also<br />\nseeking Congressional approval<br />\nto incorporate HEWs Teacher<br />\nCorps into the agency, as well as<br />\nan additional $20 million to<br />\nfund experiments with new ways<br />\nto use volunteers. ACTION's<br />\nhead is Joseph H. Blatchford,<br />\nformer director of the Peace<br />\nCorps.<br />\nSome of the groups welded<br />\ninto the new agency charged<br />\nthat the merger proposal was a<br />\nmove away from social action, as<br />\nwell as being too vague and<br />\ninefficient. Prior to submitting<br />\nthe reorganization plan to<br />\nCongress on March 24, the<br />\nNixon administration was also<br />\nwracked by sharp disagreements<br />\nbetween Peace Corps and VISTA<br />\nofficials over the shape of the<br />\nnew agency's programs.<br />\nMajor opposition to the<br />\nformation of ACTION came<br />\nfrom the 4,800 VISTA<br />\nvolunteers who work with the<br />\npoor in such areas as economic<br />\ndevelopment, manpower, social<br />\nservice, law, housing and<br />\ncommunity planning.<br />\nThe Nixon administration had<br />\nbegun last spring to shift the<br />\nfocus of VISTA work away from<br />\ncommunity organizing\u2014which<br />\nhad often placed volunteers at<br />\nodds with local governments\u2014to<br />\nmore nonpolitical social services.<br />\nThe Office of Economic<br />\nOp portunity(0E0), which<br />\noversees VISTA, also began<br />\nrecruiting older volunteers with<br />\nspecialized skills rather than<br />\nyoung generalists, in addition to<br /><br />\nending the practice of<br />\nrecommending draft deferments<br />\nfor VISTA volunteers.<br />\nDocuments<br />\nVolunteer opposition to the<br />\nnew agency was spearheaded by<br />\nthe National VISTA Alliance,<br />\nwith its 2,000 dues-paying<br />\nmembers. NVA leaders<br />\ncontended that the<br />\nadministration was bent on<br />\nweakening VISTA and<br /><br />\nsupport for the program.<br />\nFinal Decision<br />\nBlatchford and other<br />\nadministration officials noted,<br />\nhowever, that VISTA was indeed<br />\nbeing funded for fiscal year<br />\n1972. Opponents asserted that<br />\nthis was only because the<br />\ndamaging documents were<br />\nleaked to the press. But as<br />\nBlatchford told student press<br />\nrepresentatives Wednesday, \"It's<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\ndismantling 0E0. Merger critics<br />\npointed to a number of<br />\nadministration documents and<br />\nmoves which they said showed<br />\n\"an attitude of neglect\" towards<br />\nVISTA.<br />\nThey noted, for example, that<br />\nJohn Wilson, an 0E0 planning<br />\nofficer, wrote in a January, 1971<br />\nmemo that it would be<br />\n\"politically\" unwise to end<br />\nVISTA abruptly.
