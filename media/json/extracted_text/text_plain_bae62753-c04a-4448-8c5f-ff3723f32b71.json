Wilson Shaffer<br />\n<br />\nNo More Please<br />\nThe elections for the president of the Student Council which concludes tonight climaxes a week of electioneering which was unique in its transquility. The undergraduate body apparently did not exhibit more concern<br />\nwith the candidates than a passive curiosity; the candidates themselves were ostensibly reluctant to soapbox<br />\ntheir views around campus.<br />\nThe general lack of enthusiasm which students exhibit toward their government can he traced to two principal situations. Primarily, the student body realizes the<br />\nineffectiveness of student government, in general, and<br />\nfeels no obligation to support candidates who merit no<br />\nrespect. However, the reputation of the Student Council<br />\nhas further deteriorated because of the SC's conduct and<br />\npoor public relations during the past year.<br />\nThe Student Council could function with much<br />\nmore dignity than it has despite the weaknesses built<br />\nwithin its makeup. The Assembly Committee which has<br />\ncustomarily brought speakers to campus was almost nonfunctioning this year in spite of its $1000 budget. The<br />\nCouncil itself which has acted as host for the University<br />\nat many campus wide events in the past was also inactive.<br />\nDuring the past year the News-Letter repeatedly<br />\nmade suggestions for the improvement of student government. At election time we wish to make one more.<br />\nIf the SC cannot reconstitute its make-up, as we have<br />\nsuggested, according to organizational leaders rather<br />\nthan by representatives, it can at least take over the functions of the Booster Club and the Cotillion Board thus<br />\nmaking student government more important and necessitating more participation and efficiencies from its body.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, APRIL 5, 1963<br />\n<br />\nHomewood's Carroll Jr.<br />\nPortrayed As Urbane<br />\n(Following is the first of two into an uncompleted house, for<br />\n\"Charles Carroll of Home..<br />\narticles on the history and de- on July 31, 1803, more than a wood,\" he writes, \"was unquessign of Homewood House, one year later, the elder Carroll tionably one of the most elegant<br />\nof the oldest buildings in Balti- again writes urging the dis- and distinguished looking men<br />\nmore and the architectural mo- charge of the workmen.<br />\nthat in a large intercourse with<br />\ndel for every major structure on<br />\nThis was, in truth, a formida- the world I have ever met.

Spurred by the complaints about \"nothing to<br />\ndo and no place to go\" which are an integral part of so<br />\nmany Homewood gripe sessions, a study was initiated to<br />\ndetermine exactly what is going on in Baltimore and<br />\nwhat the University can do to fill in the gaps.<br />\nThe first result, an impressively large black notebook containing a day by day listing of plays, concerts,<br />\nlectures and anything else which might prove of interest<br />\nto an undergraduate\u2014indicates that Baltimore, hole<br />\nthough it may he, is less empty than its reputation would<br />\nindicate.<br />\nIn spite of the heartening report, it cannot be denied<br />\nthat the life of the undergraduate at Hopkins is often<br />\nmuch less than exciting and that whatever diversions<br />\nBaltimore offers do not make it more so. To be sure the<br />\nenterprising and independent can find their way about,<br />\noften with the help of their fraternity, but even then it<br />\nis not easy to take full advantage of the social and<br />\ncultural opportunities available in the city.<br />\nOne of the chief problems has been lack of information and here Mr. Spalding's pilot study, once expanded and made readily available, should help considerably. A further step in the same direction would be<br />\nto establish some sort of ticket agency, perhaps through<br />\nthe Playshop or the Student Shop in Levering, so that<br />\ntickets to the Lyric, Center Stage, Civic Center, Peabody<br />\netc. would be readily available on campus. This would<br />\neliminate one of the chief logistical problems involved<br />\nin getting out into the wide world of Baltimore, and<br />\ncould conceivably provide a source of revenue for the<br />\npromoter.<br />\nThe Administration also seems to be pushing, informally, for a co-ordinating body to control social and<br />\ncultural events on campus. There are at present about<br />\nhalf a dozen organizations who, at one time or another,<br />\nbring people to campus, to say nothing of occasional<br />\nindiN idual entrepreneurs, and all act in more or less<br />\nignorance of the other's programs. The need for coordination is obvious, but to set up a rigid set of controls<br />\nfor the scheduling of public gatherings would perhaps be<br />\nequally had. The one good point of the laissez-faire<br />\nsystem which now exists is its spontaneity and to maintain this without total disorganization requires only that<br />\nthe co-ordinating body act as a clearing house and source<br />\nof information with no power to legislate what will and<br />\nwill not happen. There are more than enough groups<br />\nactive in promoting programs to insure a full schedule<br />\nof events, and more are springing up. The Student Council Assembly Committee has been active and successful<br />\nin the past, the classes are showing interest in promoting<br />\nSpeakers and musical events, Levering Hall's entrepreneurial efforts are legendary, and political groups,<br />\nsuch as CONCERN seem to be reviving themselves. If all<br />\nof these function, nothing more is necessary than a<br />\ncoordinating body to make sure they do not get in each<br />\nother's way.<br />\nWhile the small Renaissance which appears to he<br />\nbrewing on the social and cultural scene has yet to define<br />\nits direction, there are encouraging signs of<br />\nlife.

Wilson Shaffer<br /><br />\nNo More Please<br />\nThe elections for the president of the Student Council which concludes tonight climaxes a week of electioneering which was unique in its transquility. The undergraduate body apparently did not exhibit more concern<br />\nwith the candidates than a passive curiosity; the candidates themselves were ostensibly reluctant to soapbox<br />\ntheir views around campus.<br />\nThe general lack of enthusiasm which students exhibit toward their government can he traced to two principal situations. Primarily, the student body realizes the<br />\nineffectiveness of student government, in general, and<br />\nfeels no obligation to support candidates who merit no<br />\nrespect. However, the reputation of the Student Council<br />\nhas further deteriorated because of the SC's conduct and<br />\npoor public relations during the past year.<br />\nThe Student Council could function with much<br />\nmore dignity than it has despite the weaknesses built<br />\nwithin its makeup. The Assembly Committee which has<br />\ncustomarily brought speakers to campus was almost nonfunctioning this year in spite of its $1000 budget. The<br />\nCouncil itself which has acted as host for the University<br />\nat many campus wide events in the past was also inactive.<br />\nDuring the past year the News-Letter repeatedly<br />\nmade suggestions for the improvement of student government.

Spurred by the complaints about \"nothing to<br />\ndo and no place to go\" which are an integral part of so<br />\nmany Homewood gripe sessions, a study was initiated to<br />\ndetermine exactly what is going on in Baltimore and<br />\nwhat the University can do to fill in the gaps.<br />\nThe first result, an impressively large black notebook containing a day by day listing of plays, concerts,<br />\nlectures and anything else which might prove of interest<br />\nto an undergraduate\u2014indicates that Baltimore, hole<br />\nthough it may he, is less empty than its reputation would<br />\nindicate.<br />\nIn spite of the heartening report, it cannot be denied<br />\nthat the life of the undergraduate at Hopkins is often<br />\nmuch less than exciting and that whatever diversions<br />\nBaltimore offers do not make it more so. To be sure the<br />\nenterprising and independent can find their way about,<br />\noften with the help of their fraternity, but even then it<br />\nis not easy to take full advantage of the social and<br />\ncultural opportunities available in the city.<br />\nOne of the chief problems has been lack of information and here Mr. Spalding's pilot study, once expanded and made readily available, should help considerably. A further step in the same direction would be<br />\nto establish some sort of ticket agency, perhaps through<br />\nthe Playshop or the Student Shop in Levering, so that<br />\ntickets to the Lyric, Center Stage, Civic Center, Peabody<br />\netc. would be readily available on campus. This would<br />\neliminate one of the chief logistical problems involved<br />\nin getting out into the wide world of Baltimore, and<br />\ncould conceivably provide a source of revenue for the<br />\npromoter.<br />\nThe Administration also seems to be pushing, informally, for a co-ordinating body to control social and<br />\ncultural events on campus. There are at present about<br />\nhalf a dozen organizations who, at one time or another,<br />\nbring people to campus, to say nothing of occasional<br />\nindiN idual entrepreneurs, and all act in more or less<br />\nignorance of the other's programs. The need for coordination is obvious, but to set up a rigid set of controls<br />\nfor the scheduling of public gatherings would perhaps be<br />\nequally had. The one good point of the laissez-faire<br />\nsystem which now exists is its spontaneity and to maintain this without total disorganization requires only that<br />\nthe co-ordinating body act as a clearing house and source<br />\nof information with no power to legislate what will and<br />\nwill not happen. There are more than enough groups<br />\nactive in promoting programs to insure a full schedule<br />\nof events, and more are springing up. The Student Council Assembly Committee has been active and successful<br />\nin the past, the classes are showing interest in promoting<br />\nSpeakers and musical events, Levering Hall's entrepreneurial efforts are legendary, and political groups,<br />\nsuch as CONCERN seem to be reviving themselves. If all<br />\nof these function, nothing more is necessary than a<br />\ncoordinating body to make sure they do not get in each<br />\nother's way.<br />\nWhile the small Renaissance which appears to he<br />\nbrewing on the social and cultural scene has yet to define<br />\nits direction, there are encouraging signs of<br />\nlife.
