WIGHT SPEAKS<br />\nON COLLEGE LIFE<br />\nEntertains Friendship Council<br />\nWith Interesting Address<br />\nFAVORS STUDENT CONTROL<br />\nTells Amusing Anecdotes of Life<br />\nAt Scotch Universities<br />\nAmusing anecdotes and reminiscenses formed the basis of Dr.<br />\nCarol Van Buren Wi'ght's address<br />\nat the Y. M. C. A. Friendship Council supper last Tuesday evening.<br />\nMost of these -very interesting<br />\nstories had morals which were exPlanatory of what Dr. Wight<br />\ntermed \"the Phenomena -of. student<br />\nlife.\" When college students get<br />\nout of hand the blame usually rests<br />\nUpon the faculty, said Dr. Wight.<br />\nThe recent Harvard-Yale fracas<br />\nwas caused in part by the attempt<br />\nof the faculty to interfere with matters not strictly in their own province.<br />\nThe college takes a grave responsibility in the matter of lending<br />\nofficial support to extra-curricular<br />\nactivities, inasmuch as they are held<br />\nresponsible for any damage incurred, which in its turn decreases<br />\nthe salaries of the unfortunate collegiate professors.<br /><br />\nic<br /><br />\nRE<br /><br />\nProfessors too Critical<br /><br />\nCollege professors are too prone<br />\nto criticize students for doing things<br />\nthey themselves did in ,the past.<br />\nDr. Wight then called upon his<br />\nmemory for a few facts to prove<br />\nthat students are not as wild as<br />\nformerly. Nowadays, students do<br />\nnot get up a drinking party, go on<br />\na boat trip down the bay, and after<br />\ntaking command of the boat, proceed to demolish it.<br />\nMethods of raising money in<br />\nScotland for the support of universities were described very amusingly by Dr. Wight. Some time<br />\nback the students raised money by<br />\nraising Cain. In a body the students would descend upon the police court, interrupting all business<br />\nuntil a certain amount had been<br />\nPaid by the judge.

However, we feel that the<br />\ntuner wanted to be nice about the<br />\nmatter, for most of the residents<br />\nare familiar with the violent beatings that the piano suffers.

Have<br />\nthey opportunity to exercise creative<br />\ntalent? Is individual work recognized?<br /><br />\non the hill-top near<br />\nHomestead,Pennsylvania, and<br />\nlook out over the Carnegie Steel<br />\nCompany's vast works. Your eye<br />\nfalls on a huge new building,<br />\ncovering 30 acres. It is the<br />\nstructural steel department, and<br />\nhere electricity performs every<br />\nmechanical operation in steel<br />\nrolling from the<br />\nsoaking pits on<br />\nthrough to the<br />\nshipping departTAND<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\nment. This Homestead electrification, predominantly Westinghouse, is one of the most notable<br />\nin history \u2014notable because of the<br />\nnumber and size of the motors<br />\nemployed and notable because of<br />\nnew features of automatic control<br />\nintroduced for the first time.<br />\nThis is a type of engineering<br />\nthat only an organization of the<br />\nsize and resources of Westinghouse<br />\ncan undertake. Achieving the<br />\nstupendous, the never-before-<br /><br />\nundertaken, is not rare here.<br />\nHence young men of capacity, of<br />\nenterprise, of genius, are offered<br />\nmuch to challenge their imaginations and abilities.<br />\nVV<br /><br />\nV<br /><br />\nIn one unit ofthe Homestead Mill is<br />\na reversing motor rated at 8,000 h.p.<br />\nand 40 r.p.m. (pictured above), the<br />\nlargest single-armature motor ever<br />\nbuilt. This motor and all the mill accessories are controlled by two men.<br />\nThey maneuver steel ingots as heavy<br />\nas 3o,000 lbs. There is a total of 336<br />\nmotors in the new mill, of which<br />\n49,000 h.p. are main<br />\nroll drive motors<br />\nand 50,935 h.p. are<br />\nauxiliaries.<br /><br />\nWestinghouse<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 16, 1927<br /><br />\nHOPKINS MUSICAL<br />\nASSOCIATION MEETS<br />\nPhilip S.
