Applause greeted the names of Sylvester, Morris<br />\n, Rovvgand,<br />\nAdams, Williams, Keeler, and the martyr Lazear.<br />\nAnd now came the most touching part of his entire address,<br />\nthe valedictory<br />\nto his former associates. The members of the faculty rose as<br />\nDr. Gilman turned<br />\nto address to them his last words. He recalled the years which<br />\nthey had passed<br />\ntogether in the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of learnin<br />\ng. Speaking of what he hoped the university would be in the future,<br />\nhe said: \"An air of<br />\nrepose, of reflection, and of study pervades the place. It<br />\nis the home of bright<br />\nand earnest youth, fitting themselves for the various pursuits<br />\nof life. Beneath<br />\nthe Wyman oak sits an antiquary, reading in a musty pamphl<br />\net the record of<br />\nthe nineteenth century, and I hear him say: 'Those men were<br />\nthe modern<br />\nknights of King Arthur pledged to a noble quest\u2014the quest<br />\nof truth,\u2014and<br />\nbound to their university by ties of loyalty, affection, and<br />\nlofty aspiration!\"<br />\nOn behalf of the alumni\" Dr. Woodrow Wilson (Ph. D. 1886) of<br />\nPrinceton<br />\nUniversity presented to Dr. Gilman an Address beautifully<br />\nbound, and having<br />\nappended to it the autographs of 1112 former students of the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nAddresses of welcome were delivered by Principal Peterson of<br />\nMcGill University, President Hadley of Yale University, President Dabne<br />\ny of the University of Tennessee, and President Harper of the University of<br />\nChicago.<br />\nThe exercises closed with the singing of \"My Country, 'tis<br />\nof Thee,\" by<br />\nthe audience, one of the most unique incidents of the celebration.<br />\nTHE SECOND DAY'S EXERCISES.<br />\nIIEN the procession was entirely seated and the<br />\nlast strains of Liszt's<br />\n\"Festival March\" had died away, President Remsen<br />\nintroduced to the<br />\ncrowded audience His Excellency John Walter<br />\nSmith, Governor of<br />\nMaryland. He was greeted by much applause and a \"Rahrah-rah-Maryland!\"<br />\nfrom the rooters. After words of welcome and congra<br />\ntulation, and tributes to<br />\nDr. Gilman and Dr. Remsen, Governor Smith came<br />\nto the interesting point of<br />\ndefining the relation of the State to the University.<br />\nHe declared first that \"there<br />\nis a reciprocity of duty existing between the public<br />\nand this private corpora<br />\ntion.\" Then, after detailing the public functions<br />\nof the University, and the<br />\nbenefits conferred by it upon Maryland and Baltimore,<br />\nhe said: \"If then these<br />\nare the benefits conferred by the Johns Hopkins upon<br />\nthe public at large, and<br />\nmore especially upon the state of Maryland and the<br />\ncity of Baltimore, what is<br />\nthe reciprocal obligation due by said city and state<br />\nto the university? Can there<br />\nbe any doubt about it? Can anyone question the<br />\npropriety, aye, the public policy, of fostering and nourishing, of promoting<br />\nand aiding in any and every way<br />\nnecessary the welfare, the prosperity, the great missio<br />\nn and work of such an institution?\"<br />\nAfter Governor Smith had concluded, Presid<br />\nent Remsen was led by Dr.<br />\nGilman to a chair, copied exactly after one<br />\nused for many years by Harvard<br />\npresidents, and presented by Hopkins Alumn<br />\ni of Harvard.<br />\n<br />\nen,<br />\n<br />\n\f\u201e<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Ira Remsen.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Emeritus Daniel C. Gilman.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Gilman, after a brief appreciation of the new president, shook him<br />\nheartily by the hand, saying:<br />\n\"You are thrice welcome to this seat, Ira Remsen, doctor of laws in Yale,<br />\nColumbia, and Princeton. May the blessing of God be with you!\"<br />\nTurning to the audience, he said: \"Now let us All rise and do honor to our<br />\nnew President \" As the assemblage moved to its feet, Dr. George B. Shattuck,<br />\nchief marshal, mounted on the steps of the stage and called for \"Three cheers<br />\nand a Remsen!\" These were followed by the chorus of \"Our Alma Mater in<br />\nDixie Land,\" sung by the rooters. Again there was tremendous applause, succeeded by an expectant hush and eager attention, as President Remsen ad\u2022<br />\nvanced. He began:<br />\n\"As I entered the building this morning, I was told that this was the beginning of my reign.\" The universal laughter at this introduction, and also<br />\nat the speaker's next remark, about \"the rain of yesterday,\" most effectually<br />\nbroke the ice, and produced a feeling of mutual understanding and good-will<br />\nbetween speaker and hearers that was not lost during the masterly address that<br />\nfollowed.<br />\nThe speech was an extremely able discussion of the function of the school<br />\nof philosophy, or \"graduate\" school in this country. President Remsen said<br />\nin part:<br />\n\"On an occasion of this kind, when one of the young universities of the<br />\ncountry is celebrating in a quiet way the 25th anniversary of its foundation,<br />\nand when a new presiding officer makes his first appearance before a large<br />\nassemblage, it seems fitting that he, upon whom has been placed the responsibility of guiding, for the present, the affairs of the university, should take the<br />\nopportunity thus afforded of giving expression to a few thoughts that suggest<br />\nthemselves when one begins to reflect upon the significance of the university<br />\nmovement in this country. Everyone at all acquainted with educational matters knows that the differentiation of the university from the college is the most<br />\ncharacteristic fact in the history of higher education during the past quarter<br />\ncentury. It is well that we should ask ourselves, What does this tendency<br />\nmean? Whither is the movement likely to carry us?\"<br />\nPresident Remsen explained that he would have little to say concerning the<br />\ncollegiate department, since this was a familiar subject of discussion, but added:<br />\n\"There is,however, one phase of the college problem that is so closely con.<br />\nnected with that of the university that I cannot avoid some reference to it.<br />\nThere is a marked and rapidly growing tendency to make college work<br />\nthe<br />\nbasis of the work in professional schools. As is well known, some of our<br />\nmedical schools now require a college degree for admission. The average<br />\nage<br />\nof graduation from our leading colleges is so high that the students<br />\ncannot<br />\nbegin their professional courses until they are from 22 to 23 years<br />\nof age on the<br />\naverage. Then, too, the length of the professional courses is greater than<br />\nit<br />\nformerly was, so that some of the best years of life are taken up in preparator<br />\ny<br />\nwork. One thing seems to admit of no denial, and that is that, in so far<br />\nas it<br />\nprevents students from beginning their professional studies or their work<br />\nin<br />\nbusiness life until they have attained the age of 22 or 23, our present system<br />\nis<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nseriously defective. The defect is one that must be remedied. Various efforts<br />\nare now being made looking to improvement, but it is not yet clear how this<br />\nproblem will be solved.\"<br />\nEntering upon the main topic of his address, President Remsen said:<br />\n\"A fully developed university includes at least four departments\u2014the<br />\nmedical, the legal, the theological and the philosophical; or, in other words,<br />\nthe university faculty comprises faculties of mcdicine, of law, of theology and<br />\nof philosophy. The new thing in educational work in this country is the philosophical faculty of our universities.\"<br />\nThe speaker called attention first, to the recent increase in numbers of the<br />\nso called \"graduate\" students in this country, giving these figures:<br />\n\"1. In 1850 there were 8 graduate students in all of the colleges of the<br />\ncountry. Of these 3 were enrolled at Harvard, 3 at Yale, 1 at the University of<br />\nVirginia, and 1 at Trinity College.<br />\n''2. In 1875 the number had increased to 399.<br />\n\"3 In 1900 the number enrolled was 5668.<br />\n\"At present the number cannot be far from 6000. At the same time, there<br />\nhas been a slight. decrease in the attendance at German universities.\"<br />\nLooking for the cause of this numerical increase, President Remsen found<br />\nthat \"probably the principal direct cause is the increased demand on the part<br />\nof the colleges, and to some extent of the high schools, for teachers who have<br />\nhad university training.\"<br />\nNext there came a strong exposition of the general benefits to the community of the philosophical faculty. First, the colleges can be kept up to a high<br />\nstandard only by the maintenance of the university on a high plane, since this<br />\nwill be reflected in the college faculties. Secondly, the bounds of knowledge<br />\nare enlarged mainly by the work of the universities\u2014\"the true home of the<br />\ninvestigator.\" \"The practical discoveries that contribute so much to the health<br />\nand comfort of mankind\" usually begin \"in some university workshop where<br />\nan enthusiastic professor has spent his time prying into the secrets of nature.\"<br />\nThirdly, \"the material value to the world of the work carried on in university<br />\nlaboratories cannot be overestimated.\" Fourthly, the intellectual advancement<br />\nof the world is dependent in many ways upon the investigations in the various<br />\nsubjects of the universities. This advancement is of greater importance than<br />\nthe others. ``There are, then, deep-seated reasons for encouraging the work of<br />\nour universities in every possible way. We cannot afford to let them languish.<br />\nThe interests involved are too great. The more clearly this is recognized the<br />\nbetter for us.\"<br />\nAfter discussing the qualities that go to make up an ideal professor\u2014chief<br />\namong which is an active leadership in his particular branch of research\u2014<br />\nPresident Remsen concluded as follows:<br />\n\"Will you allow me a few personal words: Those of you who know most<br />\nof the occurrences of last year know best that the office, the duties of which I<br />\nformally assume to-day, came to me unexpectedly and against my wishes. My<br />\nlife up to the present has been spent as a teacher. I ask no higher occupation.<br />\nThere is none more rewarding. It would have been agreeable to me to continue<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nin this occupation to the end. Indeed,even as matters now stand, I hope it will<br />\nnot be necessary for me to withdraw entirely from the work to which my life<br />\nhas thus far been devoted. On the other hand, I recognize to the full the importance of the new work to which I have been called, and I accept the new<br />\nduties with the intention of using every effort to further the interests of this<br />\nuniversity. Having taken the step, I accept the responsibility. I cannot permit<br />\nanything to interfere with the work of the presidency. I believe, however, that<br />\nI shall not be obliged to give up that which is dear to me in the science of<br />\nchemistry.<br />\nIn conclusion, I wish to express my hearty thanks to my distinguished<br />\npredecessor, to my colleagues, to the students of the university and to this community for the kindness with which they have accepted my election. I could<br />\nnot ask for better treatment. In return, I can only promise to do all that in me<br />\nlies to make this university worthy of its history, to make it as helpful as possible, not only to this community, of which I am proud to be a member, but to<br />\nthe state and to the country. It is my earnest wish, as I am sure it is yours,<br />\nthat the period upon which the university now enters may be at least as useful<br />\nas that which now ends.<br />\nWe have passed through a time of great anxiety. Causes have been in<br />\noperation that have of late seriously interfered with our development. It is not<br />\nstrange that the world at large should have received the impression that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University had seen its best days. The fact is that the doleful<br />\nstories that have been going the rounds have a slight basis. It is this: The<br />\ngrowth of the university has been temporarily checked. It has not gone backward, but, for a time at least, it has stood still. I believe that a new day has at<br />\nlast dawned and that the onward march will soon be taken up. Our difficulties have by no means been overcome, but a magnificent beginning has been<br />\nmade. The public spirit .and generosity of William Wyman, of William<br />\nKeyser, of Samuel Keyser, of Francis M. Jencks, of William M. Buckler and<br />\nJulian Le Roy White are worthy of the highest commendation. These highminded men have started the new era. They have shown their confidence in<br />\nthe work of the university and set an example to their fellow men. I would<br />\nnot detract in the least from the praise due to every one of these gentlemen, but<br />\nI am sure the others whom I have named will pardon me if in conclusion I exclaim, Long live William Wyman and William Keyser!\"<br />\nPRESIDENT ELIOT'S CONGRATULATION.<br />\nFTER mentioning that he had .welcomed Dr. Gilman on his accession to<br />\nthe presidency of the Hopkins 25 years ago, President Eliot congratulated him on his wonderful achievement, both in the graduate and in<br />\nthe medical school. He said:<br />\n\"The graduate school of Harvard started feebly in 1870-'71, but it did<br />\nnot thrive until the example of the Johns Hopkins University forced the faculty<br />\nto greatly strengthen our own graduate school. What was done by Harvard as<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\na result of Hopkins' example was true of other seats of learning all over the<br />\ncountry.\"<br />\nProceeding from the past to the present and future, he said:<br />\n\"President Remsen, I want to congratulate you on the labors which are<br />\nbefore you, just as I did President Gilman. How far has the result confirmed<br />\nthe congratulations? Has he not had joy and gladness in it? To the citizens<br />\nof Baltimore and of Maryland I say, the labor lies before you, for the Johns<br />\nHopkins University is an institution whose development must depend on private endowment.<br />\nI know of no juster test to apply to an American community than this:<br />\n\"Do they endow the higher education?\"<br />\nGentlemen, I welcome you, the trustees of the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nto this function. I welcome the citizens of Maryland and of the United States.<br />\nEmulate the example of Massachusetts, of Boston. A fortnight ago a citizen of<br />\nNew York offered Harvard $1,000,000 for the promotion of medical research,<br />\nprovided that we should raise above his gift the sum of $765,000. Within this<br />\nshort time we have raised $570,000 of that amount. Alumni of the Johns Hopkins, friends and citizens of Baltimore, wheresoever you may be, I beg you go<br />\nand do likewise.\"<br />\n<br />\nHONORARY DEGREES CONFERRED BY THE JOHNS HOPKINS.<br />\nHE first Honorary degrees that have ever been conferred by the Johns<br />\nHopkins University were presented at the celebration to the following<br />\nmen: Messrs.

Never before has her place been so publicly and generously accorded<br />\nas on the two days of the celebration when speakers from North and South,<br />\nfrom East and West acclaimed in almost one voice: 'The new star which arose<br />\nin the educational sky twenty-five years ago has now reached the zenith of the<br />\nsystem, and its light gives light unto all.' With high-minded generosity the<br />\nPresidents of Yale, of Harvard, the representatives of Southern and Western<br />\neducation, the delegates from Canada, paid glowing tributes to Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, and received her, the child university, into the sisterhood of centuryold institutions. The whole celebration, with its dignified simplicity, was a<br />\ncontinued source of inspiration; and the enlifting thoughts which all sons of<br />\nJohns Hopkins must feel at the noble tributes paid their Alma Maier are be<br />\nyond expression: we can simply say we are proud to class ourselves among<br />\nthose men to whom Dr. Gilman said: \"Go on my friends, and bear the banner<br />\nwherever you go, the banner of the university, and God be with you.<br />\n<br />\n\fAT<br />\nHOMEWOOD.<br />\n<br />\n1777..,<br />\n_<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022;\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n..791g. \u2022<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n'*t<br />\n\u2022 7\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n:<br />\n<br />\njib<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n-cier\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n14_ \"itr,<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n7<br />\n.<br />\n6<br />\n\u2022-\u2022\u2022\u2022-\u2022<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n1<br />\n111111<br />\n<br />\n.11;\u201c-<br />\n<br />\n016/1.011.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u20224\u2022440.-<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\"Scatsz,<br />\n:rt<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\ne,<br />\n\"<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\n\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\n4it<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTHE REGISTER.<br />\n<br />\nHarvard University\u2014President Charles<br />\nWilliam Eliot, LL.

B.<br />\n<br />\n\f12<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nMr. William Keyser.<br />\nHOMEWOOD WITH NO CONDITIONS.<br />\nN February 13th, the gratifying announcement was made public that<br />\n\"Homewood\" was to be given to the University with no conditions or<br />\nlimitations. It will be recalled that just one year ago, Messrs. William<br />\nKeyser, William Wyman, Francis M. Jencks, Julian Leroy White, William H.<br />\nBuckler, A. J. Ulman, David H. Carroll, of Baltimore, and Samuel Keyser of<br />\nNew York, offered the tract of land situated on Charles Street Avenue, known<br />\nas \"Homewood,\" consisting of 176 acres to the University on condition that it<br />\nbe used as a site for the University and that an endowment fund of $1,000,000<br />\nbe raised. May 1st, 1901, was the limit for raising the money. This generous<br />\noffer was received with the greatest joy by all the friends of the University,<br />\nbecause owing to unavoidable circumstances the funds left by Johns Hopkins<br />\nhad become seriously impaired, and, as i consequence, the work of the University hampered. A subscription list was started and several handsome contributions were pledged, but after a time the enthusiasm died out, and the time<br />\nlimit passed without the required amount being raised. However, the donors<br />\nwishing to give the friends of the University every opportunity, extended the<br />\ntime until the anniversary celebration this month. Since then a number of<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\n\f4.6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\nMr. William Wyman.<br />\nrumors concerning the $1,000,000 endowment fund have risen, but they wer.<br />\ndenied as quickly as they appeared. It began to look as if Baltimoreans were<br />\nblind to what was plainly evident to the rest of the country: the vast importance of continuing the noble work of the University, and were going to let the<br />\ninstitution languish. President Remsen's statement at the Princeton Alumni<br />\nbanquet, that there was \"light ahead,\" was a most hopeful announcement,<br />\nthough he denied that there was any foundation for the report that the $1,000,000 had been raised. All doubts about \"Homewood\" were set at rest when it<br />\nbecame known that, as stated above, the generous donors were going to give<br />\nthe property without any conditions to the University. An effort was made to<br />\nkeep this a secret until the 22nd instant, but owing to the wide-reaching negotiations for the various pieces of land this was impossible.<br />\nWhen the offer was first made it was stipulated. that 10 acres should be<br />\nreserved for a public park. It is now arranged to devote 40 acres for a public<br />\npark, which land will be deeded to the city of Baltimore. This leaves 136 acres<br />\nfor the University\u2014ample room for all that is needed to create an ideal university. It gives us a site with opportunities for indefinite development. As<br />\nPresident Remsen said: \"It will give us opportunities for an undergraduate<br />\ndepartment such as the University has never had, and at the same time it will<br />\n<br />\n\f14<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nnot be unfavorable to the graduate work which has given the University such<br />\na reputation.\" Several landscape gardeners have gone over the grounds, and<br />\nhave expressed their opinion that the tract is one of the finest in point of natural<br />\nbeauty so near any large city in America. The ground is within easy reach of<br />\nthe center of the city, being not more than twenty minutes ride by electric car<br />\nfrom the City Hall, and students will be able to enjoy the advantages of the<br />\ncity and, at the same time, the seclusion of the country.<br />\nIt is proposed to connect the University grounds and the park to the city<br />\nby a magnificent boulevard that will be a connecting link between the city and<br />\nthe University. It is to be hoped that this link is only the first in a long chain<br />\nwhich will connect the city and the University as they have never been before.<br />\n<br />\nTHE RECEPTION IN McCOY HALL.<br />\nN spite of the inclement weather and the wretched condition of the streets,<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nMcCoy Hall was crowded with the alumni, faculty and friends of the<br />\nUniversity, who were willing to brave all the discomforts of the storm in<br />\norder to show their loyalty by attending the reception given Friday night, February 21st. More than 2,000 invitations had been sent out, and almost as many<br />\nmore were sought by those who from some oversight had not applied in time<br />\nfor invitations.<br />\nNever before have the halls and corridors shown such tasteful and luxuriant decorations. Potted plants and palms were on all sides, and the ceilings<br />\nand walls were festooned with evergreens. On the three floors usually devoted<br />\nto study and recitations, the various departments had exhibits which attracted<br />\nmuch interest, and helped to show visitors the scope of work which the Johns<br />\nHopkins has been doing. The multiplex telegraph, invented by the late Professor Rowland, and Prof. Wood's miniature mirage attracted much notice.<br />\nOn the first floor, sweet strains of music were wafted through the corridors and<br />\nhalls by an orchestra screened behind banks of palms. At one end of the main<br />\nhall President and Mrs. Remsen and, later on, Mrs. Gilman received the guests.<br />\nA light collation was served near the close of the reception.<br />\n<br />\nTHE ALUMNI BANQUET.<br />\nANY of the men present at the Alumni Banquet, which closed the exercises on Saturday night, are of the opinion that it was the most enjoyable event of the whole celebration. In any case it was the least dignified, and it was not characterized by that quiet simplicity which was so noticeable on Friday afternoon and Saturday morning. For the first time in Hopkins<br />\nhistory was there a genuine and general reunion of her sons, for the first time<br />\ndid the New England Fociety join with the Western Alumni Association in a<br />\njovial celebration of their Alma Mater's greatest day. From the first class<br />\nwhich graduated to the newest child, naughty-one, representatives were present;<br />\nand old times were revived by well remembered college songs and class yells.<br />\nNever did our \"Hullabaloo\" resound with such joyfulinotes as when the whole<br />\n<br />\np<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n15<br />\n<br />\nassembly, time after time, literally made the rafters tremble with discordant<br />\nharmony. As is expected from the youth of the university, not many greyheads were present; but those who were forget the color of their hair in the<br />\nexuberance of their spirits.<br />\nMusic Hall was still in the festive decorations of the morning, and the<br />\nrows of banquet tables set for some 600 guests were loaded with the best of the<br />\nseason's delicacies. The feed\u2014and its accessories\u2014lasted until 11 o'clock,<br />\nwhen Dr. Jeffrey Brackett, President of the Alumni Association for 1901-1902,<br />\nwith a few words of welcome introduced Professor Josiah Royce, of Harvard,<br />\nPh. D. 1878, LL. D. 1902, as the toast master of the evening. As Dr. Royce<br />\nwas the first president of the Johns Hopkins Alumni Association, one of the<br />\nfirst four men who took their Ph. D. degree, and one of the four of her sons who<br />\nreceived the LL. D. degree this year, his selection as toast-master was very<br />\nappropriate. Dr. Royce was on the left of Dr. Brackett, at the head table, at<br />\nwhich also sat Dr. Gilman, President Remsen and many of the distinguished<br />\ndelegates to the celebration who spoke at the Banquet.<br />\nThe speeches were characterized by the dignity which might be expected<br />\nfrom college presidents. Those who spoke were President Remsen, President<br />\nEmeritus Gilman, President Eliot of Harvard, President Patton of Princeton,<br />\nPresident Alderman of Tulane, President Hadley of Yale, President Angell of<br />\nMichigan.<br />\nThe officers elected at the meeting Saturday morning to serve for 1902-1903<br />\nare as follows: President, William Thompson Sedgwick, Ph. D., '81 (Boston);<br />\nSecretary, Alfred Jenkins Shriver, A. B., '91; Treasurer, Henry Oliver ThompA. B. '84.<br />\nson, A. B., '87.<br />\nFROM FRIDAY'S SPEECHES.<br />\nDR. OILMAN.<br />\n<br />\nIt is meet and right and our bounden duty to commemorate the munificence<br />\nof the founder, who in his grove at Clifton and at his residence in town spent<br />\nthe close of his life in perfecting a plan by which his fortune might be made to<br />\nbenefit humanity. Two noble purposes, the education of youth and the relief<br />\nof suffering\u2014the Johns Hopkins University and the Johns Hopkins Hospital\u2014<br />\nbecame the objects of his thought and bounty.<br />\nThe founder made no effort to unfold a plan. He simply used one word\u2014<br />\nuniversity\u2014and he left it to his successors to declare its meaning in the light of<br />\nthe past, in the hope of the future. He was a large minded man, who knew<br />\nthat the success of the foundation would depend upon the wisdom of those to<br />\nwhom its development was entrusted; and the trustees were large minded men,<br />\nwho knew that their efforts must be guided by the learning, the experience and<br />\nAs we cast our thoughts backward,memories<br />\nthe devotion of the faculty.<br />\nof the good and great who have been members of our society rise vividly before us<br />\n\u2014benefactors who have aided us by generous gifts, in emergencies and in prosperity; faithful guardians of the trust; illustrious teachers, and brilliant schol\u2022<br />\nars who have proceeded to posts of usefulness and honor, now and then in<br />\n<br />\n\f16<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWSLETTER.<br />\n<br />\nJapan, in India, in Canada, but most of them in our own land, from Harvard<br />\nto the Golden Gate.<br />\nToday, happily, apprehensions are not felt, to any great extent, respecting<br />\nthe advancement of science. It is more and more clearly seen that the interpretation of the laws by which the universe is governed extending from the invisible rays of the celestial world to the most minute manifestations of organic life<br />\nreveal one plan, one purpose, one supreme sovereignty\u2014far transcending the<br />\nhighest conceptions to which the human mind can attain respecting this soverStill the work goes on Science is recogeign and infinite Power.<br />\nnized as the handmaid of religion Evolution is regarded by many theologians<br />\nas confirming the strictest doctrines of predestination. The propositions which<br />\nwere so objectionable 30 years ago are now received with as little alarm as the<br />\npropositions of Euclid.<br />\nHere the position regarding research work was taken at the outset that the<br />\nchief professors should have ample time to carry on the higher work for which<br />\nthey had shown themselves qualified, and also that younger men, as they gave<br />\nevidence of uncommon qualities, should likewise be encouraged to devote themselves to study. Even those who were candidates for degrees were taught what<br />\nwas meant by profitable investigation. They were shown how to discover the<br />\nlimits of the known; how to extend, even by minute accretions, the realm of<br />\nknowledge; how to co operate with other men in the prosecution of inquiry;<br />\nand how to record in exact language, and on the printed page, the results attained. Investigation has thus been among us the dqty of every leading professor, and he has been the guide and inspirer of fellows and pupils, whose<br />\nwork may not bear his name, but whose results are truly products of the inspi<br />\nration and guidance which he has bestowed.<br />\nThere are many who believe that the noblest work in which we have<br />\nengaged is the advancement of medical education and science. Several agencies have been favorable. The munificence of the founder established a hospital, which was recognized as soon as it was opened as the foremost of its kind<br />\nIn the face of difficulties our standard has never<br />\nin Christendom<br />\nbeen lowered.

Indeed, she has been a little too hospitable, for she still holds Dr. William Osler from McGill.\"<br />\nPRESIDENT HARPER OR CHICAGO.<br />\n<br />\n\"It seems to me indeed that this first period of which I have been speaking<br />\nis now about to behold the ushering in of a second epoch, which will mean a<br />\ndevelopment wider and more wonderful than any we have yet known. Our<br />\nmaterial resources have expanded and developed beyond the dreams of our<br />\nfathers. The skill of men is greater than ever before, and both the East and<br />\nthe great thriving West are entering upon a career of wealth and power hardly<br />\nconceived of This second period wi.1 see greater differentiation,and many high<br />\nschools will rise to the grade of colleges.

Applause greeted the names of Sylvester, Morris<br />\n, Rovvgand,<br />\nAdams, Williams, Keeler, and the martyr Lazear.<br />\nAnd now came the most touching part of his entire address,<br />\nthe valedictory<br />\nto his former associates. The members of the faculty rose as<br />\nDr. Gilman turned<br />\nto address to them his last words. He recalled the years which<br />\nthey had passed<br />\ntogether in the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of learnin<br />\ng. Speaking of what he hoped the university would be in the future,<br />\nhe said: \"An air of<br />\nrepose, of reflection, and of study pervades the place. It<br />\nis the home of bright<br />\nand earnest youth, fitting themselves for the various pursuits<br />\nof life. Beneath<br />\nthe Wyman oak sits an antiquary, reading in a musty pamphl<br />\net the record of<br />\nthe nineteenth century, and I hear him say: 'Those men were<br />\nthe modern<br />\nknights of King Arthur pledged to a noble quest\u2014the quest<br />\nof truth,\u2014and<br />\nbound to their university by ties of loyalty, affection, and<br />\nlofty aspiration!\"<br />\nOn behalf of the alumni\" Dr. Woodrow Wilson (Ph. D. 1886) of<br />\nPrinceton<br />\nUniversity presented to Dr. Gilman an Address beautifully<br />\nbound, and having<br />\nappended to it the autographs of 1112 former students of the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nAddresses of welcome were delivered by Principal Peterson of<br />\nMcGill University, President Hadley of Yale University, President Dabne<br />\ny of the University of Tennessee, and President Harper of the University of<br />\nChicago.<br />\nThe exercises closed with the singing of \"My Country, 'tis<br />\nof Thee,\" by<br />\nthe audience, one of the most unique incidents of the celebration.<br />\nTHE SECOND DAY'S EXERCISES.<br />\nIIEN the procession was entirely seated and the<br />\nlast strains of Liszt's<br />\n\"Festival March\" had died away, President Remsen<br />\nintroduced to the<br />\ncrowded audience His Excellency John Walter<br />\nSmith, Governor of<br />\nMaryland. He was greeted by much applause and a \"Rahrah-rah-Maryland!\"<br />\nfrom the rooters. After words of welcome and congra<br />\ntulation, and tributes to<br />\nDr. Gilman and Dr. Remsen, Governor Smith came<br />\nto the interesting point of<br />\ndefining the relation of the State to the University.<br />\nHe declared first that \"there<br />\nis a reciprocity of duty existing between the public<br />\nand this private corpora<br />\ntion.\" Then, after detailing the public functions<br />\nof the University, and the<br />\nbenefits conferred by it upon Maryland and Baltimore,<br />\nhe said: \"If then these<br />\nare the benefits conferred by the Johns Hopkins upon<br />\nthe public at large, and<br />\nmore especially upon the state of Maryland and the<br />\ncity of Baltimore, what is<br />\nthe reciprocal obligation due by said city and state<br />\nto the university? Can there<br />\nbe any doubt about it? Can anyone question the<br />\npropriety, aye, the public policy, of fostering and nourishing, of promoting<br />\nand aiding in any and every way<br />\nnecessary the welfare, the prosperity, the great missio<br />\nn and work of such an institution?\"<br />\nAfter Governor Smith had concluded, Presid<br />\nent Remsen was led by Dr.<br />\nGilman to a chair, copied exactly after one<br />\nused for many years by Harvard<br />\npresidents, and presented by Hopkins Alumn<br />\ni of Harvard.<br /><br />\nen,<br /><br />\n\u201e<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nPresident Ira Remsen.<br /><br />\nPresident Emeritus Daniel C. Gilman.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nDr. Gilman, after a brief appreciation of the new president, shook him<br />\nheartily by the hand, saying:<br />\n\"You are thrice welcome to this seat, Ira Remsen, doctor of laws in Yale,<br />\nColumbia, and Princeton. May the blessing of God be with you!\"<br />\nTurning to the audience, he said: \"Now let us All rise and do honor to our<br />\nnew President \" As the assemblage moved to its feet, Dr. George B. Shattuck,<br />\nchief marshal, mounted on the steps of the stage and called for \"Three cheers<br />\nand a Remsen!\" These were followed by the chorus of \"Our Alma Mater in<br />\nDixie Land,\" sung by the rooters. Again there was tremendous applause, succeeded by an expectant hush and eager attention, as President Remsen ad\u2022<br />\nvanced. He began:<br />\n\"As I entered the building this morning, I was told that this was the beginning of my reign.\" The universal laughter at this introduction, and also<br />\nat the speaker's next remark, about \"the rain of yesterday,\" most effectually<br />\nbroke the ice, and produced a feeling of mutual understanding and good-will<br />\nbetween speaker and hearers that was not lost during the masterly address that<br />\nfollowed.<br />\nThe speech was an extremely able discussion of the function of the school<br />\nof philosophy, or \"graduate\" school in this country. President Remsen said<br />\nin part:<br />\n\"On an occasion of this kind, when one of the young universities of the<br />\ncountry is celebrating in a quiet way the 25th anniversary of its foundation,<br />\nand when a new presiding officer makes his first appearance before a large<br />\nassemblage, it seems fitting that he, upon whom has been placed the responsibility of guiding, for the present, the affairs of the university, should take the<br />\nopportunity thus afforded of giving expression to a few thoughts that suggest<br />\nthemselves when one begins to reflect upon the significance of the university<br />\nmovement in this country. Everyone at all acquainted with educational matters knows that the differentiation of the university from the college is the most<br />\ncharacteristic fact in the history of higher education during the past quarter<br />\ncentury. It is well that we should ask ourselves, What does this tendency<br />\nmean? Whither is the movement likely to carry us?\"<br />\nPresident Remsen explained that he would have little to say concerning the<br />\ncollegiate department, since this was a familiar subject of discussion, but added:<br />\n\"There is,however, one phase of the college problem that is so closely con.<br />\nnected with that of the university that I cannot avoid some reference to it.<br />\nThere is a marked and rapidly growing tendency to make college work<br />\nthe<br />\nbasis of the work in professional schools. As is well known, some of our<br />\nmedical schools now require a college degree for admission. The average<br />\nage<br />\nof graduation from our leading colleges is so high that the students<br />\ncannot<br />\nbegin their professional courses until they are from 22 to 23 years<br />\nof age on the<br />\naverage. Then, too, the length of the professional courses is greater than<br />\nit<br />\nformerly was, so that some of the best years of life are taken up in preparator<br />\ny<br />\nwork. One thing seems to admit of no denial, and that is that, in so far<br />\nas it<br />\nprevents students from beginning their professional studies or their work<br />\nin<br />\nbusiness life until they have attained the age of 22 or 23, our present system<br />\nis<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nseriously defective. The defect is one that must be remedied. Various efforts<br />\nare now being made looking to improvement, but it is not yet clear how this<br />\nproblem will be solved.\"<br />\nEntering upon the main topic of his address, President Remsen said:<br />\n\"A fully developed university includes at least four departments\u2014the<br />\nmedical, the legal, the theological and the philosophical; or, in other words,<br />\nthe university faculty comprises faculties of mcdicine, of law, of theology and<br />\nof philosophy. The new thing in educational work in this country is the philosophical faculty of our universities.\"<br />\nThe speaker called attention first, to the recent increase in numbers of the<br />\nso called \"graduate\" students in this country, giving these figures:<br />\n\"1. In 1850 there were 8 graduate students in all of the colleges of the<br />\ncountry. Of these 3 were enrolled at Harvard, 3 at Yale, 1 at the University of<br />\nVirginia, and 1 at Trinity College.<br />\n''2. In 1875 the number had increased to 399.<br />\n\"3 In 1900 the number enrolled was 5668.<br />\n\"At present the number cannot be far from 6000. At the same time, there<br />\nhas been a slight. decrease in the attendance at German universities.\"<br />\nLooking for the cause of this numerical increase, President Remsen found<br />\nthat \"probably the principal direct cause is the increased demand on the part<br />\nof the colleges, and to some extent of the high schools, for teachers who have<br />\nhad university training.\"<br />\nNext there came a strong exposition of the general benefits to the community of the philosophical faculty. First, the colleges can be kept up to a high<br />\nstandard only by the maintenance of the university on a high plane, since this<br />\nwill be reflected in the college faculties. Secondly, the bounds of knowledge<br />\nare enlarged mainly by the work of the universities\u2014\"the true home of the<br />\ninvestigator.\" \"The practical discoveries that contribute so much to the health<br />\nand comfort of mankind\" usually begin \"in some university workshop where<br />\nan enthusiastic professor has spent his time prying into the secrets of nature.\"<br />\nThirdly, \"the material value to the world of the work carried on in university<br />\nlaboratories cannot be overestimated.\" Fourthly, the intellectual advancement<br />\nof the world is dependent in many ways upon the investigations in the various<br />\nsubjects of the universities. This advancement is of greater importance than<br />\nthe others. ``There are, then, deep-seated reasons for encouraging the work of<br />\nour universities in every possible way. We cannot afford to let them languish.<br />\nThe interests involved are too great. The more clearly this is recognized the<br />\nbetter for us.\"<br />\nAfter discussing the qualities that go to make up an ideal professor\u2014chief<br />\namong which is an active leadership in his particular branch of research\u2014<br />\nPresident Remsen concluded as follows:<br />\n\"Will you allow me a few personal words: Those of you who know most<br />\nof the occurrences of last year know best that the office, the duties of which I<br />\nformally assume to-day, came to me unexpectedly and against my wishes. My<br />\nlife up to the present has been spent as a teacher. I ask no higher occupation.<br />\nThere is none more rewarding. It would have been agreeable to me to continue<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nin this occupation to the end. Indeed,even as matters now stand, I hope it will<br />\nnot be necessary for me to withdraw entirely from the work to which my life<br />\nhas thus far been devoted. On the other hand, I recognize to the full the importance of the new work to which I have been called, and I accept the new<br />\nduties with the intention of using every effort to further the interests of this<br />\nuniversity. Having taken the step, I accept the responsibility. I cannot permit<br />\nanything to interfere with the work of the presidency. I believe, however, that<br />\nI shall not be obliged to give up that which is dear to me in the science of<br />\nchemistry.<br />\nIn conclusion, I wish to express my hearty thanks to my distinguished<br />\npredecessor, to my colleagues, to the students of the university and to this community for the kindness with which they have accepted my election. I could<br />\nnot ask for better treatment. In return, I can only promise to do all that in me<br />\nlies to make this university worthy of its history, to make it as helpful as possible, not only to this community, of which I am proud to be a member, but to<br />\nthe state and to the country. It is my earnest wish, as I am sure it is yours,<br />\nthat the period upon which the university now enters may be at least as useful<br />\nas that which now ends.<br />\nWe have passed through a time of great anxiety. Causes have been in<br />\noperation that have of late seriously interfered with our development. It is not<br />\nstrange that the world at large should have received the impression that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University had seen its best days. The fact is that the doleful<br />\nstories that have been going the rounds have a slight basis. It is this: The<br />\ngrowth of the university has been temporarily checked. It has not gone backward, but, for a time at least, it has stood still. I believe that a new day has at<br />\nlast dawned and that the onward march will soon be taken up. Our difficulties have by no means been overcome, but a magnificent beginning has been<br />\nmade. The public spirit .and generosity of William Wyman, of William<br />\nKeyser, of Samuel Keyser, of Francis M. Jencks, of William M. Buckler and<br />\nJulian Le Roy White are worthy of the highest commendation. These highminded men have started the new era. They have shown their confidence in<br />\nthe work of the university and set an example to their fellow men. I would<br />\nnot detract in the least from the praise due to every one of these gentlemen, but<br />\nI am sure the others whom I have named will pardon me if in conclusion I exclaim, Long live William Wyman and William Keyser!\"<br />\nPRESIDENT ELIOT'S CONGRATULATION.<br />\nFTER mentioning that he had .welcomed Dr. Gilman on his accession to<br />\nthe presidency of the Hopkins 25 years ago, President Eliot congratulated him on his wonderful achievement, both in the graduate and in<br />\nthe medical school. He said:<br />\n\"The graduate school of Harvard started feebly in 1870-'71, but it did<br />\nnot thrive until the example of the Johns Hopkins University forced the faculty<br />\nto greatly strengthen our own graduate school. What was done by Harvard as<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\na result of Hopkins' example was true of other seats of learning all over the<br />\ncountry.\"<br />\nProceeding from the past to the present and future, he said:<br />\n\"President Remsen, I want to congratulate you on the labors which are<br />\nbefore you, just as I did President Gilman. How far has the result confirmed<br />\nthe congratulations? Has he not had joy and gladness in it? To the citizens<br />\nof Baltimore and of Maryland I say, the labor lies before you, for the Johns<br />\nHopkins University is an institution whose development must depend on private endowment.<br />\nI know of no juster test to apply to an American community than this:<br />\n\"Do they endow the higher education?\"<br />\nGentlemen, I welcome you, the trustees of the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nto this function. I welcome the citizens of Maryland and of the United States.<br />\nEmulate the example of Massachusetts, of Boston. A fortnight ago a citizen of<br />\nNew York offered Harvard $1,000,000 for the promotion of medical research,<br />\nprovided that we should raise above his gift the sum of $765,000. Within this<br />\nshort time we have raised $570,000 of that amount. Alumni of the Johns Hopkins, friends and citizens of Baltimore, wheresoever you may be, I beg you go<br />\nand do likewise.\"<br /><br />\nHONORARY DEGREES CONFERRED BY THE JOHNS HOPKINS.<br />\nHE first Honorary degrees that have ever been conferred by the Johns<br />\nHopkins University were presented at the celebration to the following<br />\nmen: Messrs.

Never before has her place been so publicly and generously accorded<br />\nas on the two days of the celebration when speakers from North and South,<br />\nfrom East and West acclaimed in almost one voice: 'The new star which arose<br />\nin the educational sky twenty-five years ago has now reached the zenith of the<br />\nsystem, and its light gives light unto all.' With high-minded generosity the<br />\nPresidents of Yale, of Harvard, the representatives of Southern and Western<br />\neducation, the delegates from Canada, paid glowing tributes to Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, and received her, the child university, into the sisterhood of centuryold institutions. The whole celebration, with its dignified simplicity, was a<br />\ncontinued source of inspiration; and the enlifting thoughts which all sons of<br />\nJohns Hopkins must feel at the noble tributes paid their Alma Maier are be<br />\nyond expression: we can simply say we are proud to class ourselves among<br />\nthose men to whom Dr. Gilman said: \"Go on my friends, and bear the banner<br />\nwherever you go, the banner of the university, and God be with you.<br /><br />\nAT<br />\nHOMEWOOD.<br /><br />\n1777..,<br />\n_<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022;\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n..791g. \u2022<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n'*t<br />\n\u2022 7\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n:<br /><br />\njib<br />\n,<br /><br />\n-cier\"<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n.<br />\n14_ \"itr,<br />\n4<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n.<br />\n7<br />\n.<br />\n6<br />\n\u2022-\u2022\u2022\u2022-\u2022<br /><br />\n'<br />\n1<br />\n111111<br /><br />\n.11;\u201c-<br /><br />\n016/1.011.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u20224\u2022440.-<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\"Scatsz,<br />\n:rt<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\ne,<br />\n\"<br />\n4.<br /><br />\n\"<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\n4it<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTHE REGISTER.<br /><br />\nHarvard University\u2014President Charles<br />\nWilliam Eliot, LL.

B.<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nMr. William Keyser.<br />\nHOMEWOOD WITH NO CONDITIONS.<br />\nN February 13th, the gratifying announcement was made public that<br />\n\"Homewood\" was to be given to the University with no conditions or<br />\nlimitations. It will be recalled that just one year ago, Messrs. William<br />\nKeyser, William Wyman, Francis M. Jencks, Julian Leroy White, William H.<br />\nBuckler, A. J. Ulman, David H. Carroll, of Baltimore, and Samuel Keyser of<br />\nNew York, offered the tract of land situated on Charles Street Avenue, known<br />\nas \"Homewood,\" consisting of 176 acres to the University on condition that it<br />\nbe used as a site for the University and that an endowment fund of $1,000,000<br />\nbe raised. May 1st, 1901, was the limit for raising the money. This generous<br />\noffer was received with the greatest joy by all the friends of the University,<br />\nbecause owing to unavoidable circumstances the funds left by Johns Hopkins<br />\nhad become seriously impaired, and, as i consequence, the work of the University hampered. A subscription list was started and several handsome contributions were pledged, but after a time the enthusiasm died out, and the time<br />\nlimit passed without the required amount being raised. However, the donors<br />\nwishing to give the friends of the University every opportunity, extended the<br />\ntime until the anniversary celebration this month. Since then a number of<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\n4.6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\nMr. William Wyman.<br />\nrumors concerning the $1,000,000 endowment fund have risen, but they wer.<br />\ndenied as quickly as they appeared. It began to look as if Baltimoreans were<br />\nblind to what was plainly evident to the rest of the country: the vast importance of continuing the noble work of the University, and were going to let the<br />\ninstitution languish. President Remsen's statement at the Princeton Alumni<br />\nbanquet, that there was \"light ahead,\" was a most hopeful announcement,<br />\nthough he denied that there was any foundation for the report that the $1,000,000 had been raised. All doubts about \"Homewood\" were set at rest when it<br />\nbecame known that, as stated above, the generous donors were going to give<br />\nthe property without any conditions to the University. An effort was made to<br />\nkeep this a secret until the 22nd instant, but owing to the wide-reaching negotiations for the various pieces of land this was impossible.<br />\nWhen the offer was first made it was stipulated. that 10 acres should be<br />\nreserved for a public park. It is now arranged to devote 40 acres for a public<br />\npark, which land will be deeded to the city of Baltimore. This leaves 136 acres<br />\nfor the University\u2014ample room for all that is needed to create an ideal university. It gives us a site with opportunities for indefinite development. As<br />\nPresident Remsen said: \"It will give us opportunities for an undergraduate<br />\ndepartment such as the University has never had, and at the same time it will<br /><br />\n14<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nnot be unfavorable to the graduate work which has given the University such<br />\na reputation.\" Several landscape gardeners have gone over the grounds, and<br />\nhave expressed their opinion that the tract is one of the finest in point of natural<br />\nbeauty so near any large city in America. The ground is within easy reach of<br />\nthe center of the city, being not more than twenty minutes ride by electric car<br />\nfrom the City Hall, and students will be able to enjoy the advantages of the<br />\ncity and, at the same time, the seclusion of the country.<br />\nIt is proposed to connect the University grounds and the park to the city<br />\nby a magnificent boulevard that will be a connecting link between the city and<br />\nthe University. It is to be hoped that this link is only the first in a long chain<br />\nwhich will connect the city and the University as they have never been before.<br /><br />\nTHE RECEPTION IN McCOY HALL.<br />\nN spite of the inclement weather and the wretched condition of the streets,<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nMcCoy Hall was crowded with the alumni, faculty and friends of the<br />\nUniversity, who were willing to brave all the discomforts of the storm in<br />\norder to show their loyalty by attending the reception given Friday night, February 21st. More than 2,000 invitations had been sent out, and almost as many<br />\nmore were sought by those who from some oversight had not applied in time<br />\nfor invitations.<br />\nNever before have the halls and corridors shown such tasteful and luxuriant decorations. Potted plants and palms were on all sides, and the ceilings<br />\nand walls were festooned with evergreens. On the three floors usually devoted<br />\nto study and recitations, the various departments had exhibits which attracted<br />\nmuch interest, and helped to show visitors the scope of work which the Johns<br />\nHopkins has been doing. The multiplex telegraph, invented by the late Professor Rowland, and Prof. Wood's miniature mirage attracted much notice.<br />\nOn the first floor, sweet strains of music were wafted through the corridors and<br />\nhalls by an orchestra screened behind banks of palms. At one end of the main<br />\nhall President and Mrs. Remsen and, later on, Mrs. Gilman received the guests.<br />\nA light collation was served near the close of the reception.<br /><br />\nTHE ALUMNI BANQUET.<br />\nANY of the men present at the Alumni Banquet, which closed the exercises on Saturday night, are of the opinion that it was the most enjoyable event of the whole celebration. In any case it was the least dignified, and it was not characterized by that quiet simplicity which was so noticeable on Friday afternoon and Saturday morning. For the first time in Hopkins<br />\nhistory was there a genuine and general reunion of her sons, for the first time<br />\ndid the New England Fociety join with the Western Alumni Association in a<br />\njovial celebration of their Alma Mater's greatest day. From the first class<br />\nwhich graduated to the newest child, naughty-one, representatives were present;<br />\nand old times were revived by well remembered college songs and class yells.<br />\nNever did our \"Hullabaloo\" resound with such joyfulinotes as when the whole<br /><br />\np<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n15<br /><br />\nassembly, time after time, literally made the rafters tremble with discordant<br />\nharmony. As is expected from the youth of the university, not many greyheads were present; but those who were forget the color of their hair in the<br />\nexuberance of their spirits.<br />\nMusic Hall was still in the festive decorations of the morning, and the<br />\nrows of banquet tables set for some 600 guests were loaded with the best of the<br />\nseason's delicacies. The feed\u2014and its accessories\u2014lasted until 11 o'clock,<br />\nwhen Dr. Jeffrey Brackett, President of the Alumni Association for 1901-1902,<br />\nwith a few words of welcome introduced Professor Josiah Royce, of Harvard,<br />\nPh. D. 1878, LL. D. 1902, as the toast master of the evening. As Dr. Royce<br />\nwas the first president of the Johns Hopkins Alumni Association, one of the<br />\nfirst four men who took their Ph. D. degree, and one of the four of her sons who<br />\nreceived the LL. D. degree this year, his selection as toast-master was very<br />\nappropriate. Dr. Royce was on the left of Dr. Brackett, at the head table, at<br />\nwhich also sat Dr. Gilman, President Remsen and many of the distinguished<br />\ndelegates to the celebration who spoke at the Banquet.<br />\nThe speeches were characterized by the dignity which might be expected<br />\nfrom college presidents. Those who spoke were President Remsen, President<br />\nEmeritus Gilman, President Eliot of Harvard, President Patton of Princeton,<br />\nPresident Alderman of Tulane, President Hadley of Yale, President Angell of<br />\nMichigan.<br />\nThe officers elected at the meeting Saturday morning to serve for 1902-1903<br />\nare as follows: President, William Thompson Sedgwick, Ph. D., '81 (Boston);<br />\nSecretary, Alfred Jenkins Shriver, A. B., '91; Treasurer, Henry Oliver ThompA. B. '84.<br />\nson, A. B., '87.<br />\nFROM FRIDAY'S SPEECHES.<br />\nDR. OILMAN.<br /><br />\nIt is meet and right and our bounden duty to commemorate the munificence<br />\nof the founder, who in his grove at Clifton and at his residence in town spent<br />\nthe close of his life in perfecting a plan by which his fortune might be made to<br />\nbenefit humanity. Two noble purposes, the education of youth and the relief<br />\nof suffering\u2014the Johns Hopkins University and the Johns Hopkins Hospital\u2014<br />\nbecame the objects of his thought and bounty.<br />\nThe founder made no effort to unfold a plan. He simply used one word\u2014<br />\nuniversity\u2014and he left it to his successors to declare its meaning in the light of<br />\nthe past, in the hope of the future. He was a large minded man, who knew<br />\nthat the success of the foundation would depend upon the wisdom of those to<br />\nwhom its development was entrusted; and the trustees were large minded men,<br />\nwho knew that their efforts must be guided by the learning, the experience and<br />\nAs we cast our thoughts backward,memories<br />\nthe devotion of the faculty.<br />\nof the good and great who have been members of our society rise vividly before us<br />\n\u2014benefactors who have aided us by generous gifts, in emergencies and in prosperity; faithful guardians of the trust; illustrious teachers, and brilliant schol\u2022<br />\nars who have proceeded to posts of usefulness and honor, now and then in<br /><br />\n16<br /><br />\nTHE NEWSLETTER.<br /><br />\nJapan, in India, in Canada, but most of them in our own land, from Harvard<br />\nto the Golden Gate.<br />\nToday, happily, apprehensions are not felt, to any great extent, respecting<br />\nthe advancement of science. It is more and more clearly seen that the interpretation of the laws by which the universe is governed extending from the invisible rays of the celestial world to the most minute manifestations of organic life<br />\nreveal one plan, one purpose, one supreme sovereignty\u2014far transcending the<br />\nhighest conceptions to which the human mind can attain respecting this soverStill the work goes on Science is recogeign and infinite Power.<br />\nnized as the handmaid of religion Evolution is regarded by many theologians<br />\nas confirming the strictest doctrines of predestination. The propositions which<br />\nwere so objectionable 30 years ago are now received with as little alarm as the<br />\npropositions of Euclid.<br />\nHere the position regarding research work was taken at the outset that the<br />\nchief professors should have ample time to carry on the higher work for which<br />\nthey had shown themselves qualified, and also that younger men, as they gave<br />\nevidence of uncommon qualities, should likewise be encouraged to devote themselves to study. Even those who were candidates for degrees were taught what<br />\nwas meant by profitable investigation. They were shown how to discover the<br />\nlimits of the known; how to extend, even by minute accretions, the realm of<br />\nknowledge; how to co operate with other men in the prosecution of inquiry;<br />\nand how to record in exact language, and on the printed page, the results attained. Investigation has thus been among us the dqty of every leading professor, and he has been the guide and inspirer of fellows and pupils, whose<br />\nwork may not bear his name, but whose results are truly products of the inspi<br />\nration and guidance which he has bestowed.<br />\nThere are many who believe that the noblest work in which we have<br />\nengaged is the advancement of medical education and science. Several agencies have been favorable. The munificence of the founder established a hospital, which was recognized as soon as it was opened as the foremost of its kind<br />\nIn the face of difficulties our standard has never<br />\nin Christendom<br />\nbeen lowered. In joyous exhilaration we have breathed the oxygen of high<br />\naltitudes.<br />\nLet us look forward to leaving our restricted site for a permanent home<br />\nwhere our academic life will be \"exempt from public haunt,\" where we shall<br />\n\"find tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, sermons in stones and good<br />\nin everything.\" In faith and hope and gratitude, I have a vision of Homewood, where one pen.on and another will build the structures of which we<br />\nstand in so much need\u2014where scholarship will have its quiet retreat, where<br />\nexperimental science will be removed fTom the jar of the c'ty street, where<br />\nhealth and vigor will be promoted by athletic sports in the groves of Academus.<br />\nThe promised land which Moses sees from Pisgah our Joshua will possess.\"<br />\nALUMNI TO DR. GILMAN.<br /><br />\n\"Your catholicity of spirit was such that you looked at each part of the<br />\nuniversity in its relation to the whole, at the whole university in its relation to<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n17<br /><br />\nthe whole system of American education, and at that system of education as a<br />\nvital force in the life of the state.<br />\n\"We affirm that through the influence of the Johns Hopkins University the<br />\nwhole country has been led to place a higher and juster estimate upon 'the improvement of natural knowledge,' the cultivation of liberal learning and the development of power in culture.\"<br />\nDR. PETERSON OF MCGILL.<br /><br />\n\"I bring congratulations and best wishes from Edinburgh University, Oxford and St. Andrew's, and for McGill University I wish to acknowledge the<br />\ngreat obligations we are under to Johns Hopkins for the many courtesies she<br />\nhas extended to our graduate students. Indeed, she has been a little too hospitable, for she still holds Dr. William Osler from McGill.\"<br />\nPRESIDENT HARPER OR CHICAGO.<br /><br />\n\"It seems to me indeed that this first period of which I have been speaking<br />\nis now about to behold the ushering in of a second epoch, which will mean a<br />\ndevelopment wider and more wonderful than any we have yet known. Our<br />\nmaterial resources have expanded and developed beyond the dreams of our<br />\nfathers. The skill of men is greater than ever before, and both the East and<br />\nthe great thriving West are entering upon a career of wealth and power hardly<br />\nconceived of This second period wi.1 see greater differentiation,and many high<br />\nschools will rise to the grade of colleges.
