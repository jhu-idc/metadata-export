Only one tradition of importance has been left<br />\nto the seniors at this time of the year. Of course, they are supposed to sing songs and graduate in June, with other old customs<br />\nthrown in, but now they walk the campus like any other human<br />\nundergraduate would. There is but one exception. Seniors<br />\nare permitted to walk through the Memorial Room in Gilman<br />\nHall.<br />\nAt present all .the glory of this custom that is left to a senior<br />\nis the self-satisfaction in knowing that he alone can walk through<br />\nthe Memorial Room with a clear conscience. Even this, however,<br />\nis waning, for when he tries to make use of his privilege he meets<br />\non his way members of all classes using the same privilege, evidently with an equally clear conscience.<br />\nThe janitors are instructed to permit only seniors among<br />\nthe undergraduates to stroll through the Memorial Room, but the<br />\nonly offenders they can readily recognize are freshmen. The<br />\nother half of the undergraduate body swaggers along unmolested,<br />\neven appearing insulted if reminded of their wrong-doing.<br />\nThey fail to consider that they, too, will probably some day<br />\nhe seniors themselves, and, unless they stop their usurping of<br />\nseniors' rights, will also be usurped upon. If this realization<br />\ndoes not take effect, appealing to that selfishness in everyone, we<br />\nfear more drastic means of enforcing the waning tradition will<br />\nbe called upon in the future.<br />\nR.<br />\n<br />\nUNCONSCIOUS HYPOCRITES<br />\nStudents come to the University daily, go into the building<br />\nto attend classes, and return home, never wandering elsewhere<br />\non the campus. When asked, they will tell you that Johns Hopkins has one of the most beautiful surroundings of any univer\u2022<br />\nsity in the country. They read that somewhere, or some one<br />\ntold them so.<br />\nIf such a student would wander back of the Botanical Garden into the woods, along one of the twisting, leafy paths, he<br />\nwould tell you that Hopkins has a beautiful campus. He will<br />\nhave read it in the color of the autumn-tinted leaves, or his most<br />\nunapproachable heart will have told him so.<br />\nR.<br />\n<br />\nYES and NO<br />\n<br />\nSPEAKING<br />\nOF<br />\n<br />\nIn Memoriam<br />\nIt seems that it makes little if any difference how badly a<br />\ngiven policy falls by the way in accomplishing a desired end;<br />\nit will at any rate find ardent supporters. To wit\u2014this Interfraternity Board agreement for the open week is no exception.<br />\nUpon opening our post office box a morning or so ago we<br />\nfound frothing objection to our table in last week's Column in the<br />\nform of anonymous letters from disturbed Greeks.<br />\nThe first was to the effect that we had intentions on the<br />\nmouldable structure of the freshman mind; that we were spouting bombast; that it gave said Freshmen an alarming temerity<br />\ncomplex and further that it created a great. deal of work for<br />\nthose burning souls, the salesmen of \"Friendship never dies.\"<br />\nAh, even that we were combating the beautiful ideal of the above<br />\nBoard by writing such drivel.<br />\nThe other bore the general connotation of you are a smart<br />\nguy, ain't you? To the latter we have no reply\u2014since he answers<br />\nhis own question. Occasionally we appreciate his point of you.<br />\nTo the former, however, we feel.differently disposed. For<br />\nwe, too, are curious in knowing what \"beautiful ideal\" the Interfraternity Board had hoped to achieve by the open week. The<br />\naccomplished result is\u2014well, just what is it?'Sundry chapter<br />\ntreasuries are sadly depleted, and the freshmen are going the<br />\nsame way as they were before\u2014a quoi bon the open week?<br />\nWe modify our opinion of our own accord in adding that<br />\nthe delerious stage will not lead a freshman astray since they<br />\nhave a week of headaches in which to think it over. We opine<br />\nnow that the open week was bad simply because it was useless.<br />\n<br />\nContribution to the realm of the drama by the up-to-theminute Sophomore delegation:<br />\nGeorge (over telephone): Do you want to go along with me<br />\nto see \"Young Woodley\" this afternoon? I am taking A. Given<br />\nFrosh and thought perhaps you would like to take in the opportunity.<br />\nNathan (in answer): Woodley ? Yeh\u2014alright, but wait,<br />\nI've really got some studying to do, haven't cracked a book since<br />\nrushing season began. So listen, you take A. G. Frosh and entertain him for a couple of hours, anywhere, hear? Then I'll<br />\nmeet you with my car at Charles and Fayette at 5 o'clock and<br />\nI'll go up and spend a half hour or so with this boy Woodley<br />\nwith you.<br />\n<br />\nWe accepted a challenge from an esteemed member of the<br />\nfaculty in the manner of how much an undergraduate really<br />\nthinks. The discussion was centered upon the following opinion<br />\nfrom Samuel Butler's -Way of All Flesh.\" Some people say<br />\nthat their school days were the happiest of their lives. .They may<br />\nbe right, but I always look with suspicion upon people whom I<br />\nhear saying this.<br />\n<br />\nThe professor was most self-convinced that the average college student could not think long or straight enough to enunciate<br />\nwhether he was happy or not. Let it suffice that we thought differently. But good students note in passing that we, in a moment<br />\nof rashness, stated that we could see published any amount of<br />\nsound analysis on the question of Happiness as appreciated in<br />\nCollege.

Edmunds, we take this<br />\nopportunity of expressing our chagrin.<br />\nDr. Edmunds has been Provost<br />\nof the University for two and a<br />\nhalf years. During that time he has<br />\norganized the Alumni, greatly improved the financial status of the<br />\nUniversity, planned and executed<br />\nthe Fiftieth Anniversary Celebration, reorganized the Administrative Department of the University<br />\n\u2014in short, in a thousand ways made<br />\nhimself invaluable. No other member of the University has devoted<br />\nso much time and loyalty to his<br />\nwork. Dr. Edmunds's hours have<br />\noften been from 8:00 A. M. to<br />\n7:00 P. M., plus night work.<br />\nIt is with the greatest regret that<br />\nwe see him go\u2014the more so because without him the Student Activities Building may .not be realized.<br />\nBest wishes for your success in<br />\nyour new field, Dr. Edmunds.

Of<br />\ncourse, it is not the fault of the<br />\nFrench department that one of the<br />\nsections must be held in a room too<br />\nsmall for it; but in the study of a<br />\nlanguage, one does not have the<br />\nspontaneous interest aroused by<br />\nother more abstract subjects. Therefore, the subject-matter should be<br />\ndoubly vital. Anyone who has read<br />\nmodern English prose can hardly<br />\nfind \"Columbia\" enthralling. It is<br />\nundeniably puerile.

Only one tradition of importance has been left<br />\nto the seniors at this time of the year. Of course, they are supposed to sing songs and graduate in June, with other old customs<br />\nthrown in, but now they walk the campus like any other human<br />\nundergraduate would. There is but one exception. Seniors<br />\nare permitted to walk through the Memorial Room in Gilman<br />\nHall.<br />\nAt present all .the glory of this custom that is left to a senior<br />\nis the self-satisfaction in knowing that he alone can walk through<br />\nthe Memorial Room with a clear conscience. Even this, however,<br />\nis waning, for when he tries to make use of his privilege he meets<br />\non his way members of all classes using the same privilege, evidently with an equally clear conscience.<br />\nThe janitors are instructed to permit only seniors among<br />\nthe undergraduates to stroll through the Memorial Room, but the<br />\nonly offenders they can readily recognize are freshmen. The<br />\nother half of the undergraduate body swaggers along unmolested,<br />\neven appearing insulted if reminded of their wrong-doing.<br />\nThey fail to consider that they, too, will probably some day<br />\nhe seniors themselves, and, unless they stop their usurping of<br />\nseniors' rights, will also be usurped upon. If this realization<br />\ndoes not take effect, appealing to that selfishness in everyone, we<br />\nfear more drastic means of enforcing the waning tradition will<br />\nbe called upon in the future.<br />\nR.<br /><br />\nUNCONSCIOUS HYPOCRITES<br />\nStudents come to the University daily, go into the building<br />\nto attend classes, and return home, never wandering elsewhere<br />\non the campus. When asked, they will tell you that Johns Hopkins has one of the most beautiful surroundings of any univer\u2022<br />\nsity in the country. They read that somewhere, or some one<br />\ntold them so.<br />\nIf such a student would wander back of the Botanical Garden into the woods, along one of the twisting, leafy paths, he<br />\nwould tell you that Hopkins has a beautiful campus. He will<br />\nhave read it in the color of the autumn-tinted leaves, or his most<br />\nunapproachable heart will have told him so.<br />\nR.<br /><br />\nYES and NO<br /><br />\nSPEAKING<br />\nOF<br /><br />\nIn Memoriam<br />\nIt seems that it makes little if any difference how badly a<br />\ngiven policy falls by the way in accomplishing a desired end;<br />\nit will at any rate find ardent supporters. To wit\u2014this Interfraternity Board agreement for the open week is no exception.<br />\nUpon opening our post office box a morning or so ago we<br />\nfound frothing objection to our table in last week's Column in the<br />\nform of anonymous letters from disturbed Greeks.<br />\nThe first was to the effect that we had intentions on the<br />\nmouldable structure of the freshman mind; that we were spouting bombast; that it gave said Freshmen an alarming temerity<br />\ncomplex and further that it created a great. deal of work for<br />\nthose burning souls, the salesmen of \"Friendship never dies.\"<br />\nAh, even that we were combating the beautiful ideal of the above<br />\nBoard by writing such drivel.<br />\nThe other bore the general connotation of you are a smart<br />\nguy, ain't you? To the latter we have no reply\u2014since he answers<br />\nhis own question. Occasionally we appreciate his point of you.<br />\nTo the former, however, we feel.differently disposed. For<br />\nwe, too, are curious in knowing what \"beautiful ideal\" the Interfraternity Board had hoped to achieve by the open week. The<br />\naccomplished result is\u2014well, just what is it?'Sundry chapter<br />\ntreasuries are sadly depleted, and the freshmen are going the<br />\nsame way as they were before\u2014a quoi bon the open week?<br />\nWe modify our opinion of our own accord in adding that<br />\nthe delerious stage will not lead a freshman astray since they<br />\nhave a week of headaches in which to think it over. We opine<br />\nnow that the open week was bad simply because it was useless.<br /><br />\nContribution to the realm of the drama by the up-to-theminute Sophomore delegation:<br />\nGeorge (over telephone): Do you want to go along with me<br />\nto see \"Young Woodley\" this afternoon? I am taking A. Given<br />\nFrosh and thought perhaps you would like to take in the opportunity.<br />\nNathan (in answer): Woodley ? Yeh\u2014alright, but wait,<br />\nI've really got some studying to do, haven't cracked a book since<br />\nrushing season began. So listen, you take A. G. Frosh and entertain him for a couple of hours, anywhere, hear? Then I'll<br />\nmeet you with my car at Charles and Fayette at 5 o'clock and<br />\nI'll go up and spend a half hour or so with this boy Woodley<br />\nwith you.<br /><br />\nWe accepted a challenge from an esteemed member of the<br />\nfaculty in the manner of how much an undergraduate really<br />\nthinks. The discussion was centered upon the following opinion<br />\nfrom Samuel Butler's -Way of All Flesh.\" Some people say<br />\nthat their school days were the happiest of their lives. .They may<br />\nbe right, but I always look with suspicion upon people whom I<br />\nhear saying this.<br /><br />\nThe professor was most self-convinced that the average college student could not think long or straight enough to enunciate<br />\nwhether he was happy or not.
