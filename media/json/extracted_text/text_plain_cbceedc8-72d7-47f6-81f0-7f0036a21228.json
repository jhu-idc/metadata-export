The Orientation positions are currently<br />\nunpaid.<br />\nAccording to Susan Boswell,<br />\ndean of students, and Andrea<br />\nPerry, director of residential life,<br />\nthe plan originated about two<br />\nyears ago when former Dean of<br />\nStudents Chris Columbo<br />\nestablished a committee to look<br />\ninto ways in which other \"peer<br />\ninstitutions\" handled their student<br />\norientation programs.<br />\nThe committee was formed,<br />\naccording to Perry, in response to<br />\na dwindling applicant pool for the<br />\npositions of Orientation chair and<br />\nco-chair.<br />\nThe results of the committee,<br />\nBoswell said, indicated that most<br />\nschools paid students in \"one way<br />\nor another.\" The Student Council, however, voted down the proposal at the time.

The Catholic Community is a<br />\nlarge and active student group at<br />\nHomewood. Under the guidance of<br />\nFathers John Donohue and Bob<br />\nMichele, the community provides a<br />\nvariety of services and programs including Sunday Mass on campus, as<br />\nwell as on days of obligation and weekly<br />\n\"Newman Nights\" of dinner, discussion, and fellowship. The community<br />\nworks closely with the Office of the<br />\nChaplain, and has co-sponsored such<br />\nactivities as Thanksgiving Dinner.<br />\nParticularly valuable, however, in<br />\nthis divisive campus, is the sense of<br />\nenmmunity and belonging the organiza-<br />\n<br />\ntion conveys to its members. The<br />\nCatholic Community provides weekly<br />\nopportunitites to interact socially and in- \u2022<br />\ntellectually with a wide range of people in a relaxed, homelike setting. Such<br />\nopportunities, which are open to all, are<br />\nrare at Homewood.<br />\nThe Archdiocese's decision to cut the<br />\ncommunity's funding makes sense from<br />\na purely fiscal standpoint: \"studentparishes\" simply do not generate<br />\nenough revenue to cover themselves.<br />\nScarce resources must be allocated accordingly and in the neediest areas.<br />\nHowever, we do urge the Archdiocese<br />\nto reconsider its decision in terms of the<br />\nimpact it will have at Homewood and<br />\non its students. Approximately thirty<br />\npercent of the student population here<br />\nis Roman Catholic, about 150-200<br />\nstudents attend campus Sunday Mass,<br />\nand many more avail themselves of the<br />\nother programs and services.<br />\nIt is therefore important to a large<br />\nnumber of students that a Catholic<br />\npresence be maintained at Hopkins.

Fair enough, one supposes, from their point of view.<br />\nHopkins student activism,<br />\nrather, has been shaped by forces<br />\nwhich are unique to our school.<br />\nBecause we are spread out all<br />\nover the Homewood area thanks<br />\n<br />\nto our housing situation, the flip<br />\nside to life here is that we are integrated with the general community to a greater extent than<br />\nstudents at many other schools.<br />\nAs a result, student involvement has not been of the campus<br />\noriented variety, with all of the<br />\ningrown ivory-tower perceptions<br />\nof the world beyond that can accompany more insular institutions. For a true picture of what<br />\nHopkins is about, one has to look<br />\nbeyond the strict confines of<br />\nHomewood.<br />\n\"My instinct,\" said Chaplain<br />\nVan Utt, \"is that there are probably twice as many students who<br />\nwere placed in community service situations through our office<br />\nthis year than did a year and a half<br />\nago.\"<br />\nThe Chaplain's office acts as a<br />\nconduit for community organizations in Baltimore who are looking for volunteers, and as such<br />\ncan offer an interested student a<br />\nclearer picture of the options than<br />\nhis or her vantage point might<br />\nafford.<br />\nSpeaking of the Quality Time<br />\npublication which the Office puts<br />\nout, listing community service<br />\npossibilities in the area, Van Utt<br />\nemphasized that if, \"students see<br />\nthe Quality Time sheet and don't<br />\nsee something that initially excites<br />\nthem, we are usually able to find<br />\nsomething in the community<br />\nwhich is acceptable and interesting.

The<br />\nNewman community has been<br />\nrun by the Paulist Priests at<br />\nHopkins for over forty years, and<br />\nhas been a big part of our lives<br />\nduring our two and a half years<br />\nhere. Through this community,<br />\nwe have formed a lot of strong<br />\nfriendships, and have benefitted i<br />\nfrom the guidance of Frs. John<br />\nDonohue and Robert Michele.<br />\nWe have seen Hopkins as a<br />\nwhole benefit from the presence<br />\n<br />\nAnother plea<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt seems that Johns Hopkins is<br />\nnot the only major Maryland institution forced by budget problems to make unprecedented cutbacks. The Archdiocese of<br />\nBaltimore, over a million dollars<br />\nin debt, is cutting funding to the<br />\nHopkins Catholic Community as<br />\nof June 30. This decision was apparently made by people with<br />\nscant knowledge of our com-<br />\n<br />\nmunity other than as a line on a<br />\nledger. While I understand the<br />\nextreme financial need of the<br />\narchdiocese, and I realize that<br />\nmuch of the work of the Catholic Church is more pressing than campus ministry, I<br />\ndon't feel that the situation was looked over well<br />\nenough before the decision<br />\nwas made.<br />\nThe Hopkins Catholic Community is a very strong presence<br />\non campus. With over 150<br />\nmembers, it's one of the largest<br />\ngroups, and its range of activities<br />\nhas been expanding steadily over<br />\nthe past few years. More importantly, Newman House, the<br />\nCatholic Community center, is<br />\none of the few friendly gathering<br />\nplaces for students in this relatively antisocial school. Enabling<br />\npeople to go out on Thursday,<br />\nFriday, and Saturday nights and<br />\nsee people other than their<br />\nhousemates and classmates is probably the most important service<br />\nthe Catholic Community performs. The Catholic Community<br />\nis very much a community,<br />\nsomething which the Human<br />\nClimate Task Force found very<br />\nrare at Hopkins, and Newman<br />\nHouse is a perfect place to relax,<br />\nmeet people, and feel accepted.<br />\nThe future of the Catholic<br />\nCommunity is very much up in<br />\nthe air right now. The SAC gives<br />\nus next to nothing, and we have<br />\n,no other real sources of income.<br />\nAt this point, both Fr. John<br />\nDonahue and Fr. Bob Michele<br />\nwill probably be transferred<br />\nelsewhere at the end of the school<br />\nyear. And although nothing has<br />\nbeen decided about Newman<br />\nHouse, the temptation for the archdiocese to sell the rowhouse for<br />\nneeded funds must be great.

While cats can survive falls from at least thirty-two<br />\nstories, humans rarely survive<br />\nfalls greater than six stories (1<br />\nstory equals 12 feet). According to<br />\nUCLA physiologist Jared Diamond. \"this phenomena has not<br />\nreceived the scientific attention it<br />\ndeserves.\"<br />\nAn animal's recovery from a<br />\nfall is called high-rise syndrome.<br />\nHigh-rise syndrome has been<br />\nstudied twice in cats. The more<br />\nrecent study was made by Wayne<br />\n0. Whitney and Cheryl Mehlhaff<br />\nin 1984 at the Animal Medical<br />\nClinic in New York. The<br />\n<br />\nveterinarians based the study on<br />\n132 consecutive cases of high-rise<br />\nsyndrome treated at the animal<br />\nhospital and on published reports<br />\nfor human injuries. The distance<br />\nfallen was known only for 129<br />\ncats. The mean distance was five<br />\nand a half stories, while the range<br />\nwas two to thirty-two stories.<br />\nWhitney and Mehlhaffs first<br />\nconclusion was that most cats survive high falls.

Only<br />\nthirty percent needed emergency ,<br />\nor life-sustaining treatment. Most<br />\nof the treated cats were released<br />\nwithin two to five days.<br />\nWhitney and Mehlhaff explain<br />\nthe difference between cat and<br />\nhuman injuries using a few basic<br />\nprinciples of physics. Severity of<br />\ninjuries is determined by the<br />\nstress a body experiences at impact. Impact stress is related to a<br />\nnumber of factors.<br />\nFirst, impact stress is directly<br />\nproportional to force. Force is<br />\npartially determined by the<br />\ndistance fallen. As a body falls,<br />\nits velocity increases. The greater<br />\nthe velocity at impact, the greater<br />\nthe force. Force is also affected<br />\nby body mass\u2014greater mass<br />\nequals greater force. The hardness of the surface also contributes to impact force. Softer<br />\nsurfaces tend to 'give,' which<br />\nreduces the force applied to the<br />\nbody. In this study, however,<br />\nalmost all of the cats fell to concrete pavement.<br />\nImpact stress is inversely proportional to the area of the cat<br />\nwhich hits the ground. For instance, as a cat falls it twists<br />\naround until all four feet are facing downward. When the cat<br />\nlands, stress is evenly distributed<br />\nover four limbs. When human<br />\nadults fall, they tumble uncontrollably and usually land on<br />\neither their legs or their head.<br />\nWhen human babies fall, the<br />\nrelatively large size of their heads<br />\ncauses them to fall on their heads<br />\nwhile their arms extend outward<br />\nby reflex to break the fall. Consequently, stress is distributed<br />\nover a relatively small area for<br />\nhumans. As a result, they experience greater impact stress<br />\nthan cats experience. Furthermore, while head injuries are the<br />\nmain cause of mortality in man,<br />\ncats rarely sustain fatal head<br />\ninjuries.<br />\nOne interesting observation is<br />\nthe relationship between the<br />\n<br />\nPeary found not to be a fraud<br />\nby Sharyn Horowitz<br />\nThe National Geographic<br />\nSociety, in a press conference<br />\nFebruary 1, announced that<br />\nRobert E.

What Rawlins thought<br />\nwere solar altitude measurements<br />\nare actually chronometer<br />\nreadings, and what he thought<br />\nwere navigational observations<br />\nare actually the serial numbers of<br />\nthe timepieces.<br />\nThe scrap of paper, included in<br />\nthe personal papers of former<br />\nJHU president and Peary family<br />\nfriend Isaiah Bowman, was a<br />\nhandwritten copy of a document<br />\nnow stored with Peary's personal<br />\npapers in the National Archives.<br />\nThis document was sealed in an<br />\nenvelope marked, in Peary's wife<br />\nJo's handwriting, as observations<br />\nof April 6, 1909 from the North<br />\nPole. Rawlins calculated Peary's<br />\n' \u2022<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nposition from the numbers, and<br />\nfound it to be 121 miles from the<br />\nPole. He accused Peary of being<br />\nnot only a bad navigator, but a<br />\nliar. The Navigation Foundation<br />\nstudy concluded that the scrap<br />\npaper was from Peary's 1906<br />\nPolar expedition, and that the<br />\nenvelope was mislabeled. Davies<br />\nspeculated that Jo Peary had<br />\nmistakenly thought that this scrap<br />\npaper was a certain piece of<br />\nevidence that Peary had told her<br />\n\"to guard with her life.\" Davies<br />\nbelieves that this critical evidence<br />\nmay still lie unnoticed in the National Archives.<br />\nAlthough Peary's honor has<br />\nbeen cleared, his ability as a<br />\nnavigator is still in question. The<br />\nNavigation Foundation is continuing its analysis of Peary's expedition, and expects to make a<br />\njudgment about whether or not<br />\nPeary actually reached the Pole in<br />\nthree months.

Ford, like<br />\nCarver, writes about people in the<br />\nPacific Northwest who have the<br />\n(often harsh) mundanities of life<br />\nthrust upon them; his prose is<br />\nequally flat, chiselled, and dry;<br />\nand the dramatic effects are<br />\nalways achieved through \"quiet\"<br />\nintrospection.

The victory<br />\nbroke a two game losing streak<br />\nand kept the Jays in first place in<br />\nthe MAC South East Division.<br />\nThe last time Hopkins had a<br />\nwinning record was 1973-74,<br />\nwhen they finished with a 17-9<br />\nrecord. The Blue Jays, under<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert, Sr., went on<br />\nto defeat Muhlenberg in overtime<br />\nfor the MAC Southern title and<br />\nmade a trip to the NCAA Division III tournament.<br />\nHopkins jumped out to a quick<br />\n13-4 lead on Wednesday, sparked<br />\nby seven early points by<br />\nsophomore Andy Enfield. The<br />\nrest of the first half, however,<br />\nwas marked by sloppy play from<br />\nboth teams, as the Jays began to<br />\nplay down to their 4-18<br />\nopponents.<br />\nAfter taking a 36-25 lead into<br />\nthe intermission, the Jays were<br />\nunable to pull away from the<br />\nQuakers in the second half.<br />\nSwarthmore's Scott Gibbons<br />\nwent on a shooting tear mid-way<br />\nthrough the second half, hitting<br />\n3 three-pointers to cut Hopkins's<br />\nlead to ten with just under eight<br />\nminutes remaining in the game.<br />\nThat's when the Quakers'<br />\ntempers cost them a chance to get<br />\nback in the game.<br />\nAfter being called for an offensive foul, Swarthmore's Mike<br />\nGreenstone proceeded to pick up<br />\na technical foul. When the<br />\nQuakers' coach, Lee Wimberly,<br />\nargued the call, he too was<br />\n<br />\nslapped with a technical. Andy Enfield swished the three free<br />\nthrows, and then connected from<br />\nfifteen feet on the ensuing possession to give Hopkins a commanding 66-51 lead with 7:07 remaining. On the night, Enfield was a<br />\nperfect 11-11 from the charity<br />\nstripe and led all scorers with<br />\ntwenty points.<br />\nThe Quakers again managed to<br />\ncut the Jays' lead to ten, this time<br />\nled by their freshman center<br />\nRobert Ruffin, who led<br />\nSwarthmore with nineteen points<br />\nand thirteen rebounds on the<br />\nnight. Jedan Phillips, however,<br />\nbroke his scoring slump late in<br />\nthe game to seal the victory for<br />\nHopkins. Phillips hit 6-9 from the<br />\nfield and 5-6 from the line as he<br />\nfinished with eighteen points.<br />\nMike Latimore added fourteen<br />\npoints to help the Jays improve to<br />\n6-2 in the conference and 13-7<br />\noverall.<br />\nThe victory was a much needed one for the Jays. as it snapped<br />\na two game losing streak and kept<br />\nthem in the thick of the MAC title race. Hopkins was coming off<br />\na tough road defeat at Widener,<br />\nwhere the Jays missed an opportunity to take control of the division race by falling 76-64 despite<br />\ntwenty-one points from Andy<br />\nEnfield.<br />\nThe MAC South East title race<br />\nis now a dogfight, to say the least.<br />\nHopkins leads the division with a<br />\n6-2 record, but Ursinus,<br />\nWashington College, and<br />\nWidener are all right on the Jays'<br />\nheels with 5-2 records. The Blue<br />\nJays' remaining divisional games<br />\nare next Wednesday at home<br />\nagainst the hapless Haverford<br />\nFords and next Friday night<br />\nagainst Washington College in<br />\n<br />\nChestertown. Washington has the<br />\nmost difficult schedule of the<br />\nteams involved in the title race,<br />\nas they must face Ursinus,<br />\nWidener, and Hopkins in the next<br />\nweek. Ursinus has games left<br />\nagainst Widener, Washington,<br />\nand Swarthmore, while Widener<br />\nmust face Ursinus, Washington,<br />\nand Haverford. What all of this<br />\nmeans is that it's anybody's race.<br />\nThe worst that Hopkins can do,<br />\nbarring a miracle upset by Haverford next Wednesday, is tie for<br />\nsecond place, which would mean<br />\nthat the Jays' would have to<br />\nplayoff for the right to face<br />\nFranklin & Marshall in the MAC<br />\nTournament.<br />\nOne thing is certain, however.<br />\nHopkins will have a winning<br />\nrecord at the end of the 1988-89<br />\nbasketball season. And like the<br />\nteam of 1973-74, they will probably make the MAC playoffs.<br />\nAfter fifteen years of losing<br />\nbasketball, what they do from<br />\nthere is merely icing on the cake.<br />\nNotes: This weekend, Hopkins<br />\ntravels to St. Louis and Cleveland<br />\nfor two UAA games. Tonight, the<br />\nJays will face the defending UAA<br />\nchamps, Washington University,<br />\nin Missouri. So far this season,<br />\nWashington is 14-6 overall and<br />\n5-3 in the UAA. On Saturday<br />\nnight, Hopkins will meet Case<br />\nWestern (2-5 in the UAA, 2-19<br />\noverall) in Cleveland before<br />\nreturing home to face Haverford<br />\non Wednesday.

The Orientation positions are currently<br />\nunpaid.<br />\nAccording to Susan Boswell,<br />\ndean of students, and Andrea<br />\nPerry, director of residential life,<br />\nthe plan originated about two<br />\nyears ago when former Dean of<br />\nStudents Chris Columbo<br />\nestablished a committee to look<br />\ninto ways in which other \"peer<br />\ninstitutions\" handled their student<br />\norientation programs.<br />\nThe committee was formed,<br />\naccording to Perry, in response to<br />\na dwindling applicant pool for the<br />\npositions of Orientation chair and<br />\nco-chair.<br />\nThe results of the committee,<br />\nBoswell said, indicated that most<br />\nschools paid students in \"one way<br />\nor another.\" The Student Council, however, voted down the proposal at the time. Hopkins currently allows Orientation chairs<br />\nuniversity housing over the<br />\nsummer.<br />\nThe issue has arisen again this<br />\nyear, partly because \"very<br />\nserious communication problems<br />\narose,\" according to Perry,<br />\nbecause last summer's advising<br />\nco-chairs had full-time jobs offcampus and were not available<br /><br />\nfor<br />\nseveral<br />\n\"important<br />\nmeetings.\"<br />\nAccording to Perry, \"six key<br />\npeople need to communicate<br />\nregularly and frequently: the<br />\ndirector and assistant directors of<br />\nresidential life, and the chair and<br />\ntwo advising co-chairs of Orientation.\" Last summer's orientation chair, Ellen Stolis, was able<br />\nto attend to matters full-time<br />\nbecause she worked as an assistant in the Residential Life office.<br />\nThe plan's backers also justify<br />\npaying Orientation heads because<br />\ntheir positions are different in<br />\nnature than other student activities. According to Boswell,<br />\n\"Orientation is different because<br />\nit will happen whether students<br />\nrun it or not.

Under the guidance of<br />\nFathers John Donohue and Bob<br />\nMichele, the community provides a<br />\nvariety of services and programs including Sunday Mass on campus, as<br />\nwell as on days of obligation and weekly<br />\n\"Newman Nights\" of dinner, discussion, and fellowship. The community<br />\nworks closely with the Office of the<br />\nChaplain, and has co-sponsored such<br />\nactivities as Thanksgiving Dinner.<br />\nParticularly valuable, however, in<br />\nthis divisive campus, is the sense of<br />\nenmmunity and belonging the organiza-<br /><br />\ntion conveys to its members. The<br />\nCatholic Community provides weekly<br />\nopportunitites to interact socially and in- \u2022<br />\ntellectually with a wide range of people in a relaxed, homelike setting. Such<br />\nopportunities, which are open to all, are<br />\nrare at Homewood.<br />\nThe Archdiocese's decision to cut the<br />\ncommunity's funding makes sense from<br />\na purely fiscal standpoint: \"studentparishes\" simply do not generate<br />\nenough revenue to cover themselves.<br />\nScarce resources must be allocated accordingly and in the neediest areas.<br />\nHowever, we do urge the Archdiocese<br />\nto reconsider its decision in terms of the<br />\nimpact it will have at Homewood and<br />\non its students. Approximately thirty<br />\npercent of the student population here<br />\nis Roman Catholic, about 150-200<br />\nstudents attend campus Sunday Mass,<br />\nand many more avail themselves of the<br />\nother programs and services.<br />\nIt is therefore important to a large<br />\nnumber of students that a Catholic<br />\npresence be maintained at Hopkins.

The<br />\nNewman community has been<br />\nrun by the Paulist Priests at<br />\nHopkins for over forty years, and<br />\nhas been a big part of our lives<br />\nduring our two and a half years<br />\nhere. Through this community,<br />\nwe have formed a lot of strong<br />\nfriendships, and have benefitted i<br />\nfrom the guidance of Frs. John<br />\nDonohue and Robert Michele.<br />\nWe have seen Hopkins as a<br />\nwhole benefit from the presence<br /><br />\nAnother plea<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt seems that Johns Hopkins is<br />\nnot the only major Maryland institution forced by budget problems to make unprecedented cutbacks. The Archdiocese of<br />\nBaltimore, over a million dollars<br />\nin debt, is cutting funding to the<br />\nHopkins Catholic Community as<br />\nof June 30. This decision was apparently made by people with<br />\nscant knowledge of our com-<br /><br />\nmunity other than as a line on a<br />\nledger. While I understand the<br />\nextreme financial need of the<br />\narchdiocese, and I realize that<br />\nmuch of the work of the Catholic Church is more pressing than campus ministry, I<br />\ndon't feel that the situation was looked over well<br />\nenough before the decision<br />\nwas made.<br />\nThe Hopkins Catholic Community is a very strong presence<br />\non campus. With over 150<br />\nmembers, it's one of the largest<br />\ngroups, and its range of activities<br />\nhas been expanding steadily over<br />\nthe past few years. More importantly, Newman House, the<br />\nCatholic Community center, is<br />\none of the few friendly gathering<br />\nplaces for students in this relatively antisocial school. Enabling<br />\npeople to go out on Thursday,<br />\nFriday, and Saturday nights and<br />\nsee people other than their<br />\nhousemates and classmates is probably the most important service<br />\nthe Catholic Community performs. The Catholic Community<br />\nis very much a community,<br />\nsomething which the Human<br />\nClimate Task Force found very<br />\nrare at Hopkins, and Newman<br />\nHouse is a perfect place to relax,<br />\nmeet people, and feel accepted.<br />\nThe future of the Catholic<br />\nCommunity is very much up in<br />\nthe air right now. The SAC gives<br />\nus next to nothing, and we have<br />\n,no other real sources of income.<br />\nAt this point, both Fr. John<br />\nDonahue and Fr. Bob Michele<br />\nwill probably be transferred<br />\nelsewhere at the end of the school<br />\nyear. And although nothing has<br />\nbeen decided about Newman<br />\nHouse, the temptation for the archdiocese to sell the rowhouse for<br />\nneeded funds must be great. This<br />\nis my worst fear\u2014that we end up<br />\nnot only priestless, but also<br />\nhouseless. That would be a crippling blow.<br />\nThe community is strong<br />\nenough to survive whatever happens, and we are far from giving<br />\nup on anything.

While cats can survive falls from at least thirty-two<br />\nstories, humans rarely survive<br />\nfalls greater than six stories (1<br />\nstory equals 12 feet). According to<br />\nUCLA physiologist Jared Diamond. \"this phenomena has not<br />\nreceived the scientific attention it<br />\ndeserves.\"<br />\nAn animal's recovery from a<br />\nfall is called high-rise syndrome.<br />\nHigh-rise syndrome has been<br />\nstudied twice in cats. The more<br />\nrecent study was made by Wayne<br />\n0. Whitney and Cheryl Mehlhaff<br />\nin 1984 at the Animal Medical<br />\nClinic in New York. The<br /><br />\nveterinarians based the study on<br />\n132 consecutive cases of high-rise<br />\nsyndrome treated at the animal<br />\nhospital and on published reports<br />\nfor human injuries. The distance<br />\nfallen was known only for 129<br />\ncats. The mean distance was five<br />\nand a half stories, while the range<br />\nwas two to thirty-two stories.<br />\nWhitney and Mehlhaffs first<br />\nconclusion was that most cats survive high falls.

Only<br />\nthirty percent needed emergency ,<br />\nor life-sustaining treatment. Most<br />\nof the treated cats were released<br />\nwithin two to five days.<br />\nWhitney and Mehlhaff explain<br />\nthe difference between cat and<br />\nhuman injuries using a few basic<br />\nprinciples of physics. Severity of<br />\ninjuries is determined by the<br />\nstress a body experiences at impact. Impact stress is related to a<br />\nnumber of factors.<br />\nFirst, impact stress is directly<br />\nproportional to force. Force is<br />\npartially determined by the<br />\ndistance fallen. As a body falls,<br />\nits velocity increases. The greater<br />\nthe velocity at impact, the greater<br />\nthe force. Force is also affected<br />\nby body mass\u2014greater mass<br />\nequals greater force. The hardness of the surface also contributes to impact force. Softer<br />\nsurfaces tend to 'give,' which<br />\nreduces the force applied to the<br />\nbody. In this study, however,<br />\nalmost all of the cats fell to concrete pavement.<br />\nImpact stress is inversely proportional to the area of the cat<br />\nwhich hits the ground. For instance, as a cat falls it twists<br />\naround until all four feet are facing downward. When the cat<br />\nlands, stress is evenly distributed<br />\nover four limbs. When human<br />\nadults fall, they tumble uncontrollably and usually land on<br />\neither their legs or their head.<br />\nWhen human babies fall, the<br />\nrelatively large size of their heads<br />\ncauses them to fall on their heads<br />\nwhile their arms extend outward<br />\nby reflex to break the fall. Consequently, stress is distributed<br />\nover a relatively small area for<br />\nhumans. As a result, they experience greater impact stress<br />\nthan cats experience. Furthermore, while head injuries are the<br />\nmain cause of mortality in man,<br />\ncats rarely sustain fatal head<br />\ninjuries.<br />\nOne interesting observation is<br />\nthe relationship between the<br /><br />\nPeary found not to be a fraud<br />\nby Sharyn Horowitz<br />\nThe National Geographic<br />\nSociety, in a press conference<br />\nFebruary 1, announced that<br />\nRobert E.

Rawlins calculated Peary's<br />\n' \u2022<br />\nV<br /><br />\nposition from the numbers, and<br />\nfound it to be 121 miles from the<br />\nPole.

The Navigation Foundation<br />\nstudy concluded that the scrap<br />\npaper was from Peary's 1906<br />\nPolar expedition, and that the<br />\nenvelope was mislabeled.

Ford, like<br />\nCarver, writes about people in the<br />\nPacific Northwest who have the<br />\n(often harsh) mundanities of life<br />\nthrust upon them; his prose is<br />\nequally flat, chiselled, and dry;<br />\nand the dramatic effects are<br />\nalways achieved through \"quiet\"<br />\nintrospection. But where the late<br />\nCarver was a true poet in his vision of the graceless momentum of<br />\nhis characters' lives, Ford is<br />\nnothing more than the latest in a<br />\nline of writers who are picking up<br />\nwhere Steinbeck and Faulkner<br />\nleft off.

The victory<br />\nbroke a two game losing streak<br />\nand kept the Jays in first place in<br />\nthe MAC South East Division.<br />\nThe last time Hopkins had a<br />\nwinning record was 1973-74,<br />\nwhen they finished with a 17-9<br />\nrecord. The Blue Jays, under<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert, Sr., went on<br />\nto defeat Muhlenberg in overtime<br />\nfor the MAC Southern title and<br />\nmade a trip to the NCAA Division III tournament.<br />\nHopkins jumped out to a quick<br />\n13-4 lead on Wednesday, sparked<br />\nby seven early points by<br />\nsophomore Andy Enfield. The<br />\nrest of the first half, however,<br />\nwas marked by sloppy play from<br />\nboth teams, as the Jays began to<br />\nplay down to their 4-18<br />\nopponents.<br />\nAfter taking a 36-25 lead into<br />\nthe intermission, the Jays were<br />\nunable to pull away from the<br />\nQuakers in the second half.<br />\nSwarthmore's Scott Gibbons<br />\nwent on a shooting tear mid-way<br />\nthrough the second half, hitting<br />\n3 three-pointers to cut Hopkins's<br />\nlead to ten with just under eight<br />\nminutes remaining in the game.<br />\nThat's when the Quakers'<br />\ntempers cost them a chance to get<br />\nback in the game.<br />\nAfter being called for an offensive foul, Swarthmore's Mike<br />\nGreenstone proceeded to pick up<br />\na technical foul. When the<br />\nQuakers' coach, Lee Wimberly,<br />\nargued the call, he too was<br /><br />\nslapped with a technical. Andy Enfield swished the three free<br />\nthrows, and then connected from<br />\nfifteen feet on the ensuing possession to give Hopkins a commanding 66-51 lead with 7:07 remaining. On the night, Enfield was a<br />\nperfect 11-11 from the charity<br />\nstripe and led all scorers with<br />\ntwenty points.<br />\nThe Quakers again managed to<br />\ncut the Jays' lead to ten, this time<br />\nled by their freshman center<br />\nRobert Ruffin, who led<br />\nSwarthmore with nineteen points<br />\nand thirteen rebounds on the<br />\nnight. Jedan Phillips, however,<br />\nbroke his scoring slump late in<br />\nthe game to seal the victory for<br />\nHopkins. Phillips hit 6-9 from the<br />\nfield and 5-6 from the line as he<br />\nfinished with eighteen points.<br />\nMike Latimore added fourteen<br />\npoints to help the Jays improve to<br />\n6-2 in the conference and 13-7<br />\noverall.<br />\nThe victory was a much needed one for the Jays. as it snapped<br />\na two game losing streak and kept<br />\nthem in the thick of the MAC title race. Hopkins was coming off<br />\na tough road defeat at Widener,<br />\nwhere the Jays missed an opportunity to take control of the division race by falling 76-64 despite<br />\ntwenty-one points from Andy<br />\nEnfield.<br />\nThe MAC South East title race<br />\nis now a dogfight, to say the least.<br />\nHopkins leads the division with a<br />\n6-2 record, but Ursinus,<br />\nWashington College, and<br />\nWidener are all right on the Jays'<br />\nheels with 5-2 records. The Blue<br />\nJays' remaining divisional games<br />\nare next Wednesday at home<br />\nagainst the hapless Haverford<br />\nFords and next Friday night<br />\nagainst Washington College in<br /><br />\nChestertown. Washington has the<br />\nmost difficult schedule of the<br />\nteams involved in the title race,<br />\nas they must face Ursinus,<br />\nWidener, and Hopkins in the next<br />\nweek. Ursinus has games left<br />\nagainst Widener, Washington,<br />\nand Swarthmore, while Widener<br />\nmust face Ursinus, Washington,<br />\nand Haverford. What all of this<br />\nmeans is that it's anybody's race.<br />\nThe worst that Hopkins can do,<br />\nbarring a miracle upset by Haverford next Wednesday, is tie for<br />\nsecond place, which would mean<br />\nthat the Jays' would have to<br />\nplayoff for the right to face<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall in the MAC<br />\nTournament.<br />\nOne thing is certain, however.<br />\nHopkins will have a winning<br />\nrecord at the end of the 1988-89<br />\nbasketball season. And like the<br />\nteam of 1973-74, they will probably make the MAC playoffs.<br />\nAfter fifteen years of losing<br />\nbasketball, what they do from<br />\nthere is merely icing on the cake.<br />\nNotes: This weekend, Hopkins<br />\ntravels to St. Louis and Cleveland<br />\nfor two UAA games. Tonight, the<br />\nJays will face the defending UAA<br />\nchamps, Washington University,<br />\nin Missouri. So far this season,<br />\nWashington is 14-6 overall and<br />\n5-3 in the UAA. On Saturday<br />\nnight, Hopkins will meet Case<br />\nWestern (2-5 in the UAA, 2-19<br />\noverall) in Cleveland before<br />\nreturing home to face Haverford<br />\non Wednesday.

It could have become a Hopkins Valentine Tradition. For example,<br />\nlast year's Question 11 was,\"Who has the longest schlong on record?\" Imagine<br />\nsome biology grad students rummaging through one of their Mole Cell books,<br />\nscratching their heads. \"Schlong? Schlong? Is that like ring finger? Or a big<br />\ntoe?\" No dice, guys. Actually, a popular jibe at my predecessor was that he needed<br />\nto run a sex quiz because he himself was undersexed. For that reason, I passed<br />\non writing a sequel. Traditions die hard. (No pun intended.)<br />\nFebruary 10 is as close as I can get to February 14, so I have prepared a grotesquely easy Valentine's quiz. Get your entries to the News-Letter hot tub (ne.e<br />\nGatehousg, but the combination of the holiday and the BMA Sculpture Garden's<br />\nflooding our basement makes Hot Tub oh so appropriate) by February 15 at 5<br />\np.m. And please, let's have some new people enter. There's always a first time.<br />\n(Both puns intended.)<br />\nResults: I certainly hope you people can relate to love as well as you can relate<br />\nto The Beatles.(What a world that would be.) And you all weren't even around<br />\nwhen The Beatles were popular! I can say \"you all\" because grad students don't<br />\nenter. They're still waiting for The Gala Leviathan Quiz I promised them. Well,<br />\nmaybe sometime. Then again, maybe not. Probably not. Certainly not. I guess.<br />\nLots of entries this week. The winner was Jonathan \"Win One for the\" Zipp<br />\nand the answers were: 1) Scrambled Egg; 2) Cry for a Shadow; 3) Michelle;<br />\n4) Badfinger; 5) Ringo; 6) Jesus Christ's disciples; 7)\"Sky of blue and sea of<br />\ngreen\"; 8) Mal Evans (Paul missed the photo session); 9) Pop Go the Beatles<br />\nor Saturday Club; 10) \"Well she was just seventeen/A teenage beauty queen\";<br />\n11) Christmastime; 12) Hello Little Girl, The Fourmost; 13) \"Oompah, oompah, stick it up your jumper\" and \"Everybody's got one\"; 14) Rain; 15) Bob<br />\nDylan; 16) Lady Madonna; 17) Mahatma Gandhi; 18) Helter Skelter; 19) Julia;<br />\n20) John; 21) Michael Jackson (a/k/a Plasticman); 22) Savoy Truffle; 23) Dig<br />\nIt, Don't Pass Me By, Flying, Maggie Mae, Octopus's Garden, and What Goes<br />\nOn; 24) an anvil; 25) Peter Fonda!<br />\nWinners have two weeks to claim prizes.
