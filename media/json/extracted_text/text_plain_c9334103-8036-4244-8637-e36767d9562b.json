At the beginning of the play, we learn that<br />\nthe cherry orchard is to be sold at<br />\nauction to pay for the debts of<br />\nLyubov Andreyevna. At the end of<br />\nthe play the cherry orchard has been<br />\nsold, and the family moves out of<br />\nits ancestral home. At the end of<br />\nthe play we know no more than we<br />\ndid at the beginning of the play. We<br />\nhave, however, been introduced to a<br />\nwide variety of characters; in the<br />\npettiness of their actions, in the<br />\n+griefs of their souls; in the conflicts<br />\nof their minds we have shared.<br />\nTo anyone used to the conventiOnal<br />\nplay the first act of The Cherry Orchard seems stupidly slow. There is<br />\nso much talk; the characters don't<br />\nmove about. This first act does,<br />\nhowever, have its effect. The mood<br />\nfor the play is set, and we grow 'accustomed to the 'action of inaction'<br />\nwith which the play is to be concerned. This mood that is set is<br />\ndimly forboding of tragedy, but it<br />\nis not dreary; one wuld rather say<br />\nthat the mood is realistic. We have<br />\nlaughter which is mixed with grief.<br />\nWe have tragedy which is mixed<br />\nwith hope. By the end of the first<br />\nact the audience has been caught up<br />\nin the sweep of the tragedy of trivia<br />\nand is able to share in the heartbreak that ia to come to the family<br />\nwhen the estate is finally sold.
