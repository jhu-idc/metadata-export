Not<br />\nsurprisingly, since College was<br />\nregarded as a process of moral<br />\nformation as much as anything<br />\nelse, but the Hopkins was started<br />\nby industrial capitalism, the<br />\nfruits of profit from the<br />\nBaltimore and Ohio railroad.<br />\nAt the Hopkins, the older aim<br />\nof training up civilized Christian<br />\ngentlemen was dropped in favor<br />\nof a primary emphasis on<br />\nresearch. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity was the first<br />\ninstitution to subordinate<br />\nstudent needs to research<br />\ndemands by setting up the<br />\ndepartmental structure, now<br />\nuniversal in our higher education.<br />\nBy doing away with the unitary<br />\ncollege by segmenting it into<br />\nspecialized, departmental areas,<br />\nthe undergraduate was converted<br />\nfrom. the status of traditional<br />\nstudent into what he today, a<br />\npotential recruit for a higher<br />\ndegree. It was at the Hopkins<br />\nthat the process of debasing the<br />\nB.A. into a useless kindergarten<br />\ncertificate was begun.<br />\nin place of the B.A.,,the Ph.D.<br />\nwas imported from Germany and<br />\nmade the emblem of academic<br />\ndistinction. A few doctorates had<br />\nbeen granted at Yale before the<br />\nHopkins began awarding them<br />\nbut it was at this new place of<br />\nlearning in Baltimore that the<br />\nmodern Ph.D. system was<br />\nerected.<br />\n<br />\nThe system of publishing<br />\npedantic junk or perishing was<br />\nstarted at The Hopkins with the<br />\nfounding of the first university<br />\npress and the appearance of The<br />\nAmerican Journal of<br />\nMathematics in 1877. In short<br />\norder, there were a skillion more<br />\njournals for the effluvia of the<br />\nprofessoriate. Within 25 years of<br />\nthe founding of The Hopkins, the<br />\nPh.D. system had already become<br />\nso pre tensious, wasteful and<br />\ninimical to real learning, that it<br />\nwas being attacked in exactly the<br />\nsame manner and for the same<br />\nreasons. Calling the new system<br />\nan \"octopus,\" William James in<br />\n1903 said the degree was \"a<br />\nsham, a bauble, a dodge whereby<br />\nto decorate the catalogues of<br />\nschools and colleges.\"<br />\nAped<br />\nHarvard, where James taught,<br />\nnevertheless quickly aped The<br />\nJohns Hopkins system. But that<br />\nalone doesn't account for the<br />\nrapid spread of the Ph.D. and all<br />\nthat it has brought with it in the<br />\nway of curriculum<br />\nstandardization, grade-point<br />\naverages and the other<br />\nburdensome characteristics of<br />\ncontemporary higher education.<br />\nThe credit or the blame for<br />\ndestroying the older education<br />\nwith its emphasis on<br />\nindividualism, humane studies<br />\nand moral purpose goes to<br />\ncorporate capitalism, specifically<br />\nAndrew Carnegie and John D.<br />\nRockefeller.<br />\nBoth of them are up gigantic<br />\neducational charitable trusts<br />\nwhich dispensed money on the<br />\ncondition that college and<br />\nuniversities change themselves to<br />\nfit a new national system of<br />\ninterchangeable academic parts.<br />\nCarnegie, for example, demanded<br />\nthat the chairman of every<br />\ndepartment be a Ph.D. It's also<br />\nnoteworthy that Carnegie nsisted<br />\nthat religiously affiliated schools<br />\ncut their church ties as a<br />\ncondition for receiving money.<br />\nThus it is an occassion for<br />\nsmirking when modern day<br />\ncorporate givers complain about<br />\n<br />\nthe immorality of the<br />\ncontemporary university. It<br />\nprobably would have happened<br />\nanyway, but the impact of<br />\nCarnegie/Rockefeller is not only<br />\na crystalline example of the<br />\npolitical power of tax-emempt<br />\ncharitable money, it also shows<br />\nhow closely higher education was<br />\ndesigned by and is run for the<br />\nneeds of corporate capitalism.<br />\nIn recent decades the costs<br />\nhave grown so large that not even<br />\nthe Rockefellers can pick up the<br />\ntab anymore, so the financial<br />\nresponsibility has shifted over to<br />\nthe government. What's worth<br />\nmentioning, though, is that the<br />\nsystem has remained absolutely<br />\nas it was 75 or 100 years ago.<br />\nhardlto think of any other<br />\nmajor institution that has been as<br />\nrigidly impervious to any change<br />\nThe student complaints of the<br />\nlast decade have had absolutely<br />\nno effect on the administration<br />\nand organization of the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nNor have the budget cuts of<br />\nthe '70's.

The general<br />\nresponse of the higher education<br />\nindustry to budget cuts has been<br />\nto stigmatize people like Ronald<br />\nReagan, who propose them, as<br />\nreactionaries.

Cultural differences mean<br />\nvery little when the sharing of<br />\nthis feeling is involved, and that<br />\nis why I believe the crowd<br />\nenjoyed John McLaughlin and<br />\nShakti \u2022ecstatically this past<br />\nSund'ay night in the carefree<br />\nconfines of the Newton H. White<br />\nAthletic Center.<br />\nThey came to see the man<br />\nWhose guitar work has never<br />\ntailed to be impressive; the man<br />\nwho radiates happiness, and asks<br />\nno more of you than only to<br />\nsmile with him. Weather Repoprt<br />\nWas a bonus, an extra delicious<br />\nshot in the glass. John<br />\nMcLaughlin was an experience in<br />\nhimself\u2014 and most of us who<br />\nattended the concert knew it<br />\nbefore we walked in the door.<br />\nStrange reports\u2014those<br />\nperrenial rumors\u2014had been<br />\ncirculating the week before the<br />\nconcert. It was known that<br />\nMcLaughlin was no longer a<br />\ndisciple of Sri Chinmoy. Word<br />\nhad it that the man had long hair<br />\nand was surely indulging in drugs<br />\nand carnal delights.<br />\nFinally, the story was that<br />\nMcLaughlin would only be<br />\nPlaying acoustic guitar. Would we<br />\nwitness another Eric Clap ton?<br />\nWell, it was a bit different to<br />\n<br />\nsee John McLaughlin with hair<br />\ncovering his ears. He looked<br />\nperfectly at home, however, on<br />\nan Oriental rug, dressed in<br />\ntraditional Indian attire, with the<br />\nrest of Shakti. And John<br />\nMcLaughlin's eternal smile was<br />\nthere; lighting the faces of his<br />\nfellow musicians, and making the<br />\naudience happy, very happy.<br />\nTwo of the other instruments<br />\nused by the group were<br />\nunfamiliar to most, if not all, of<br />\nthe people in the audience. What<br />\nmost of us would describe as a<br />\ndrum is called a mridangam, but._<br />\nthis percussion instrument did<br />\nnot create as much excitement as<br />\ndid the other; a ghatam. This one<br />\nlooked to the crowd like a large,<br />\nearthenware pot; I suppose, in<br />\nour cultural terms, that's the best<br />\nway to describe it. A multitude<br />\nof sounds could be obtained by<br />\nbanging on the instrument in<br />\ndifferent places at different<br />\nangles.<br />\nOne of the most memorable<br />\nmoments of the set came at the<br />\nend with a duet between the<br />\nmridangam and the ghatam. Very<br />\ntight and very fast rhythms were<br />\nexchanged between the two<br />\nplayers, like a lightning ping pong<br />\ngame. The crowd was dazzled by<br />\nthe versatility of the ghatatn. As<br />\none guy said, \"Man, can he beat<br />\nthat pot!\" John McLaughlin<br />\nwas playing a 13 string. guitar,<br />\n<br />\nJohn McLaughlin<br />\n<br />\nbuilt especially for him, with<br />\nseven sitar-like -drone strings. His<br />\nmastery of the instrument was<br />\nwell demonstrated, the strong<br />\nfingers moving rapidly along the<br />\nneck of the instrument, proving<br />\nthe old adage concerning the<br />\nhand and the eye.<br />\nOblivion<br />\nIn an attempt to maintain<br />\nbalance and form, Weather<br />\nReport was experienced from the<br />\nrear, literally from behind,<br />\nbackstage.<br />\nTheir entracne set the tone for<br />\nthe performance: in a dark sea of<br />\neerie sound, the two<br />\npercussionists come on stage, get<br />\ncomfortable in the percussion<br />\npit, and call the rest of their<br />\ngroup over sensuous, enticing<br />\nrhythms. From there, it was<br />\nmusic that screamed into the<br />\nnight, compelling you to listen<br />\nand be swept along.<br />\nWHOOOSH. The sound of the<br />\nwind from the synthesiser, a<br />\npolyphonic Oberheim creation.<br />\nWHEEEE, like a jet taking off,<br />\nwith you on it, on the runway of<br />\nthe mind.<br />\nThe percussionists form the<br />\nframework for the music created<br />\nby Weather Report. The rest if<br />\nmulti-colored skin highlighting<br />\nthe animal, giving you a good<br />\ndeal to marvel at. It's like<br />\nshowing to everyone that there's<br />\nmore to you than just good<br />\n<br />\nlooks.<br />\nThe man behind the drum set<br />\nwas an amazing thing to watch<br />\nfrom behind. He had two bass<br />\ndrums, and each of his feet was<br />\ndoing a separate rhythm.<br />\nSomehow, to call it<br />\n\"coordination\" doesn't do the<br />\ngentleman justice. His set-up also<br />\nsported a unique collection of<br />\nsmall cymbals: you knew it was<br />\ncoming\u2014PING,PANG.<br />\nThe \"other\" percussionist<br />\nplayed a wide variety of<br />\nrhythm -creating instruments:<br />\ncongas, cowbell, steel drums, and<br />\nsomething that can only be<br />\ndescribed as an African<br />\nxylophone--wooden sticks on<br />\ntop, and round things that<br />\nlooked like coconuts, but<br />\nweren't, underneath. His figure<br />\nwas reflected in the glass<br />\nbackboard above him, making it<br />\nseem like you were looking<br />\ndown, watching that figure move<br />\nall over, dancing to the rhythms<br />\nhe was helping create. This man<br />\nhad ten extra pairs of drum<br />\nsticks, and for good reason.<br />\nBreakage was at a very high rate.<br />\nThe percussion sound of<br />\nWeather - Report is a fusion of<br />\nAmerican, Latin American and<br />\nA frican influences. It is rhythm<br />\nthat grabs your body and<br />\ndemands that you move. With<br />\none final barrage of energy,<br />\nWeather Report wailed into<br />\n<br />\nShakti<br />\n<br />\noblivion, and then they were<br />\ngone, vanishing in the silence of a<br />\npuff of smoke.<br />\nA good friend felt that the<br />\ngroup had not been fully<br />\nappreciated. \"The crowd wasn't<br />\nready for Jazz.\" So that was their<br />\nloss, and they're the ones who<br />\nstill have a little farther to go. It<br />\nwas music that \"lends itself to<br />\nbeing jumped up and screamed<br />\nover.\" If you didn't take<br />\nadvantage of it, maybe you really<br />\nshould next time.<br />\nAll things considered, it was a<br />\ngood concert. The only.<br />\ncomplaint I heard was that not<br />\neverybody was able to get a<br />\ndecent seat. Concert\u2022people said<br />\nit was \"undersold.\" This raises<br />\nsome sticky questions about the<br />\nviability of the Athletic Center,<br />\nbut the important thing is that<br />\nwe are having these kind of<br />\nevents on campus.<br />\nCongrats are in order to the<br />\npeople working Security and<br />\nStage.

In<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe rendition of Lady Godiva<br />\non the April 9 Newsletter forces<br />\n<br />\nme to protest Hopkins'<br />\napparently plummeting sexual<br />\nstandards. in the past several<br />\nmonths we've been barraged by<br />\nmovies like Emmanuel,Sextoons,<br />\nand The Night Porter. Offering<br />\npornography for weekend<br />\nentertainment can't be disguised<br />\nas \"enlightenment\" or<br />\n\"heightened intellectuality\". Yet<br />\nit's been tolerated. Perhaps at<br />\nHopkins we've too readily<br />\nacquiesced to the \"sexual<br />\nliberation\" of our times. I<br />\nbelieve, however, the principles<br />\non which the old standards were<br />\nformulated remain the same. Our<br />\nsexuality is a precious gift from<br />\nthe Almighty; it should be used<br />\nrespectfully to express love in<br />\nmarriage. We appear far below<br />\nthe ideal.

Jim \"The<br />\nJacksonville Kid\" Condon, Keith<br />\nBlizzard and Bob Evett are their<br />\nback-ups.<br />\nAs for the goal, torn Bender is<br />\nsacrificing his body this season as<br />\nthe team's regular goalie while<br />\nPete Burgard is his back-up.<br />\nBender is a real lacrosse Horatio<br />\nAlger story. Though he never<br />\nplayed lacrosse before this<br />\nseason, he has picked up the<br />\nbasics of goalie play with<br />\namazing speed and is now quite a<br />\ncompetentgoal-tender.

JV<br />\nlacrosse doesn't have all the<br />\npressure and the mystique of the<br />\nvarsity. But that doesn't mean<br />\nthat we're not serious about what<br />\nwe're doing.

Including Nassau.\"<br />\nThat last reference was to the<br />\nteam's game tomorrow against<br />\nNassau Community College.<br />\nNassau, the Community College<br />\nchampions in lacrosse for the last<br />\ntwo years are probably the teams<br />\ntoughest opponent this year. Last<br />\nyear, they beat Hopkins 10-7 in a<br />\npouring rain. That game's high<br />\n.scorer, Craig Jaeger, is also a<br />\nmember of this year's Nassau<br />\nteam. Mandelbaum sees him as<br />\nthe key to Nassau's offense and<br />\nhe has fingered Ed DeDomenico<br />\nfor the task of defending against<br />\nhim. It should be quite a task:<br />\nlast year Jaeger had six goals<br />\nagainst Hopkins. The game is set<br />\nfor 3:00 with the playing field to<br />\nbe either Homewood Field or the<br />\nsoccer field.<br />\n<br />\nthis case, my personal feelings on<br />\nthe subject of the Honorary<br />\nDoctorate of Laws, actually run<br />\nalien to the feelings implied by<br />\nthe irresponsible act of<br />\npublication of the letter.<br />\nI would hope that in the<br />\nfuture the authors of any and all<br />\nsigned work that appears in your<br />\npaper will be apprised of its<br />\npublication beforehand and that<br />\nall attempts will be made to<br />\navoid taking such works out of<br />\nthe context in which they may<br />\nhave been written.<br />\nI 'find your handling of this<br />\nmatter both irresponsible and<br />\npersonally insulting and I hope<br />\nthat you will refrain from such<br />\nactivity in the future.<br />\nAlan Fink<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.11/ laxers have that grand Hopkins spirit: they win<br />\nBy JIM SCHOETTLER<br />\nWhile the varsity lacrosse team<br />\nwages war against the likes of<br />\nVirginia and Maryland on<br />\nSaturdays, the Hopkins JV team<br />\nfights less-publicized battles<br />\nagainst local community colleges<br />\nand college JV's during the week.<br />\nBut though they may not oppose<br />\nthe same foes, they both do one<br />\nthing the same: they win.<br />\nWith their current record<br />\nstanding at 3-0, the JV stickmen<br />\nseem to be well on their way to<br />\nanother winning season despite<br />\nlosing several players from last<br />\nyear's 8-1 team to the varsity.

I feel that if we<br />\ncontrol the ball, we'll win all our<br />\ngames. That's why we won last<br />\nFriday.\"<br />\nMandelbaum notes, however,<br />\nthat though ball control is the<br />\n<br />\nteam's strength in games, its<br />\ntogetherness is its overall strong<br />\npoint. \"I, along with assistant<br />\ncoach Mike Riley, have outside<br />\nresponsibilities to fulfill during<br />\nthe day. (Mandelbaum is a<br />\nstudent in the Dept. of<br />\nEnvironmental Medicine and<br />\nRiley's an insurance agent.) Many<br />\ntimes we can't get to practice<br />\nuntil four. But, you know, a lot<br />\nof times I get there and the guys<br />\nhave already done their<br />\ncalisthenics and early work, and I<br />\nCan move them right into the<br />\nmajor part of practice. It's that<br />\nkind of cooperation among<br />\nthemselves and with me that lets<br />\nus improve as a team.\"<br />\nCaptains<br />\nMandelbaum feels that the<br />\nteams two captains have been a<br />\nmajor factor in this togetherness.<br />\nEd DeDemenico, one of the<br />\nteam's starting midfielders, is one<br />\nof those captains. Mandelbaum<br />\ncredits DeDomenico as being a<br />\n\"stabilizing element\" in. the<br />\nmidfield providing leadership<br />\nboth in the games and in<br />\npractice.<br />\nThe other members of<br />\nDeDomenico's midfield are PJ<br />\nBoyle and Bob Gilroy. Boyle is a<br />\nsmooth player whose stickwork<br />\nand powerful crankshot give his<br />\n<br />\nmidfield a real offensive punch.<br />\nGilroy, who never played before<br />\ncoming to Hopkins, has vastly<br />\nimproved over last year and is<br />\nnoted for his hustling ability..<br />\nNo team can run with one<br />\nmidfield, of course, and Winston<br />\nHaydon, Rodger \"Ramjet\"<br />\nFitzgerald and veteran Mark<br />\nLewis run on the team's second<br />\nmidfield. Backing them up are<br />\nDavid Fu, Neil Goldberg, and Jim<br />\nSchoettler.<br />\n<br />\nAttack<br />\n<br />\nThe attack, which last year<br />\nwas mostly made up of converted<br />\nmidfielders, has vastly improved.<br />\nLeading the first attack is Carl<br />\nYeich, the team's other captain.<br />\nAgainst Catonsville he led all<br />\nscorers with seven goals. He is a<br />\nsmart ball player whose strength<br />\nis his stickwork: many of his<br />\ngoals come after he has dodged<br />\nthrough a crowd of defensemen.<br />\nJoining Yeich on the attack<br />\nare Lee Friant, Gary Windier and<br />\nnewly acquired Rob Zinkham.<br />\nAll three are consistent players<br />\nand each normally contributes at<br />\nleast one goal a game.

A few doctorates had<br />\nbeen granted at Yale before the<br />\nHopkins began awarding them<br />\nbut it was at this new place of<br />\nlearning in Baltimore that the<br />\nmodern Ph.D. system was<br />\nerected.<br /><br />\nThe system of publishing<br />\npedantic junk or perishing was<br />\nstarted at The Hopkins with the<br />\nfounding of the first university<br />\npress and the appearance of The<br />\nAmerican Journal of<br />\nMathematics in 1877. In short<br />\norder, there were a skillion more<br />\njournals for the effluvia of the<br />\nprofessoriate. Within 25 years of<br />\nthe founding of The Hopkins, the<br />\nPh.D. system had already become<br />\nso pre tensious, wasteful and<br />\ninimical to real learning, that it<br />\nwas being attacked in exactly the<br />\nsame manner and for the same<br />\nreasons.

But that<br />\nalone doesn't account for the<br />\nrapid spread of the Ph.D. and all<br />\nthat it has brought with it in the<br />\nway of curriculum<br />\nstandardization, grade-point<br />\naverages and the other<br />\nburdensome characteristics of<br />\ncontemporary higher education.<br />\nThe credit or the blame for<br />\ndestroying the older education<br />\nwith its emphasis on<br />\nindividualism, humane studies<br />\nand moral purpose goes to<br />\ncorporate capitalism, specifically<br />\nAndrew Carnegie and John D.<br />\nRockefeller.<br />\nBoth of them are up gigantic<br />\neducational charitable trusts<br />\nwhich dispensed money on the<br />\ncondition that college and<br />\nuniversities change themselves to<br />\nfit a new national system of<br />\ninterchangeable academic parts.<br />\nCarnegie, for example, demanded<br />\nthat the chairman of every<br />\ndepartment be a Ph.D. It's also<br />\nnoteworthy that Carnegie nsisted<br />\nthat religiously affiliated schools<br />\ncut their church ties as a<br />\ncondition for receiving money.<br />\nThus it is an occassion for<br />\nsmirking when modern day<br />\ncorporate givers complain about<br /><br />\nthe immorality of the<br />\ncontemporary university. It<br />\nprobably would have happened<br />\nanyway, but the impact of<br />\nCarnegie/Rockefeller is not only<br />\na crystalline example of the<br />\npolitical power of tax-emempt<br />\ncharitable money, it also shows<br />\nhow closely higher education was<br />\ndesigned by and is run for the<br />\nneeds of corporate capitalism.<br />\nIn recent decades the costs<br />\nhave grown so large that not even<br />\nthe Rockefellers can pick up the<br />\ntab anymore, so the financial<br />\nresponsibility has shifted over to<br />\nthe government. What's worth<br />\nmentioning, though, is that the<br />\nsystem has remained absolutely<br />\nas it was 75 or 100 years ago.<br />\nhardlto think of any other<br />\nmajor institution that has been as<br />\nrigidly impervious to any change<br />\nThe student complaints of the<br />\nlast decade have had absolutely<br />\nno effect on the administration<br />\nand organization of the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nNor have the budget cuts of<br />\nthe '70's. No university has<br />\nseriously asked itself whether it<br />\nmight be able to do the same jot<br />\nor a better one for less money by<br />\nreorganizing itself. The general<br />\nresponse of the higher education<br />\nindustry to budget cuts has been<br />\nto stigmatize people like Ronald<br />\nReagan, who propose them, as<br />\nreactionaries. Either that or they<br />\njack up the tuition while<br />\ncontinuing to give their student<br />\ncustomers an increasingly shabby<br />\nproduct.<br />\nThe waste, the sloth, the<br />\nsloppy laziness and the pointless<br />\nprodigality in American highei<br />\neducation, is an open scandal and<br />\nhas been for several decades.

Cultural differences mean<br />\nvery little when the sharing of<br />\nthis feeling is involved, and that<br />\nis why I believe the crowd<br />\nenjoyed John McLaughlin and<br />\nShakti \u2022ecstatically this past<br />\nSund'ay night in the carefree<br />\nconfines of the Newton H. White<br />\nAthletic Center.<br />\nThey came to see the man<br />\nWhose guitar work has never<br />\ntailed to be impressive; the man<br />\nwho radiates happiness, and asks<br />\nno more of you than only to<br />\nsmile with him. Weather Repoprt<br />\nWas a bonus, an extra delicious<br />\nshot in the glass. John<br />\nMcLaughlin was an experience in<br />\nhimself\u2014 and most of us who<br />\nattended the concert knew it<br />\nbefore we walked in the door.<br />\nStrange reports\u2014those<br />\nperrenial rumors\u2014had been<br />\ncirculating the week before the<br />\nconcert. It was known that<br />\nMcLaughlin was no longer a<br />\ndisciple of Sri Chinmoy. Word<br />\nhad it that the man had long hair<br />\nand was surely indulging in drugs<br />\nand carnal delights.<br />\nFinally, the story was that<br />\nMcLaughlin would only be<br />\nPlaying acoustic guitar. Would we<br />\nwitness another Eric Clap ton?<br />\nWell, it was a bit different to<br /><br />\nsee John McLaughlin with hair<br />\ncovering his ears. He looked<br />\nperfectly at home, however, on<br />\nan Oriental rug, dressed in<br />\ntraditional Indian attire, with the<br />\nrest of Shakti. And John<br />\nMcLaughlin's eternal smile was<br />\nthere; lighting the faces of his<br />\nfellow musicians, and making the<br />\naudience happy, very happy.<br />\nTwo of the other instruments<br />\nused by the group were<br />\nunfamiliar to most, if not all, of<br />\nthe people in the audience. What<br />\nmost of us would describe as a<br />\ndrum is called a mridangam, but._<br />\nthis percussion instrument did<br />\nnot create as much excitement as<br />\ndid the other; a ghatam. This one<br />\nlooked to the crowd like a large,<br />\nearthenware pot; I suppose, in<br />\nour cultural terms, that's the best<br />\nway to describe it. A multitude<br />\nof sounds could be obtained by<br />\nbanging on the instrument in<br />\ndifferent places at different<br />\nangles.<br />\nOne of the most memorable<br />\nmoments of the set came at the<br />\nend with a duet between the<br />\nmridangam and the ghatam. Very<br />\ntight and very fast rhythms were<br />\nexchanged between the two<br />\nplayers, like a lightning ping pong<br />\ngame. The crowd was dazzled by<br />\nthe versatility of the ghatatn. As<br />\none guy said, \"Man, can he beat<br />\nthat pot!\" John McLaughlin<br />\nwas playing a 13 string. guitar,<br /><br />\nJohn McLaughlin<br /><br />\nbuilt especially for him, with<br />\nseven sitar-like -drone strings. His<br />\nmastery of the instrument was<br />\nwell demonstrated, the strong<br />\nfingers moving rapidly along the<br />\nneck of the instrument, proving<br />\nthe old adage concerning the<br />\nhand and the eye.<br />\nOblivion<br />\nIn an attempt to maintain<br />\nbalance and form, Weather<br />\nReport was experienced from the<br />\nrear, literally from behind,<br />\nbackstage.<br />\nTheir entracne set the tone for<br />\nthe performance: in a dark sea of<br />\neerie sound, the two<br />\npercussionists come on stage, get<br />\ncomfortable in the percussion<br />\npit, and call the rest of their<br />\ngroup over sensuous, enticing<br />\nrhythms. From there, it was<br />\nmusic that screamed into the<br />\nnight, compelling you to listen<br />\nand be swept along.<br />\nWHOOOSH. The sound of the<br />\nwind from the synthesiser, a<br />\npolyphonic Oberheim creation.<br />\nWHEEEE, like a jet taking off,<br />\nwith you on it, on the runway of<br />\nthe mind.<br />\nThe percussionists form the<br />\nframework for the music created<br />\nby Weather Report. The rest if<br />\nmulti-colored skin highlighting<br />\nthe animal, giving you a good<br />\ndeal to marvel at. It's like<br />\nshowing to everyone that there's<br />\nmore to you than just good<br /><br />\nlooks.<br />\nThe man behind the drum set<br />\nwas an amazing thing to watch<br />\nfrom behind. He had two bass<br />\ndrums, and each of his feet was<br />\ndoing a separate rhythm.<br />\nSomehow, to call it<br />\n\"coordination\" doesn't do the<br />\ngentleman justice. His set-up also<br />\nsported a unique collection of<br />\nsmall cymbals: you knew it was<br />\ncoming\u2014PING,PANG.<br />\nThe \"other\" percussionist<br />\nplayed a wide variety of<br />\nrhythm -creating instruments:<br />\ncongas, cowbell, steel drums, and<br />\nsomething that can only be<br />\ndescribed as an African<br />\nxylophone--wooden sticks on<br />\ntop, and round things that<br />\nlooked like coconuts, but<br />\nweren't, underneath. His figure<br />\nwas reflected in the glass<br />\nbackboard above him, making it<br />\nseem like you were looking<br />\ndown, watching that figure move<br />\nall over, dancing to the rhythms<br />\nhe was helping create. This man<br />\nhad ten extra pairs of drum<br />\nsticks, and for good reason.<br />\nBreakage was at a very high rate.<br />\nThe percussion sound of<br />\nWeather - Report is a fusion of<br />\nAmerican, Latin American and<br />\nA frican influences. It is rhythm<br />\nthat grabs your body and<br />\ndemands that you move. With<br />\none final barrage of energy,<br />\nWeather Report wailed into<br /><br />\nShakti<br /><br />\noblivion, and then they were<br />\ngone, vanishing in the silence of a<br />\npuff of smoke.<br />\nA good friend felt that the<br />\ngroup had not been fully<br />\nappreciated. \"The crowd wasn't<br />\nready for Jazz.\" So that was their<br />\nloss, and they're the ones who<br />\nstill have a little farther to go. It<br />\nwas music that \"lends itself to<br />\nbeing jumped up and screamed<br />\nover.\" If you didn't take<br />\nadvantage of it, maybe you really<br />\nshould next time.<br />\nAll things considered, it was a<br />\ngood concert. The only.<br />\ncomplaint I heard was that not<br />\neverybody was able to get a<br />\ndecent seat. Concert\u2022people said<br />\nit was \"undersold.\" This raises<br />\nsome sticky questions about the<br />\nviability of the Athletic Center,<br />\nbut the important thing is that<br />\nwe are having these kind of<br />\nevents on campus.<br />\nCongrats are in order to the<br />\npeople working Security and<br />\nStage.

Perhaps at<br />\nHopkins we've too readily<br />\nacquiesced to the \"sexual<br />\nliberation\" of our times. I<br />\nbelieve, however, the principles<br />\non which the old standards were<br />\nformulated remain the same. Our<br />\nsexuality is a precious gift from<br />\nthe Almighty; it should be used<br />\nrespectfully to express love in<br />\nmarriage. We appear far below<br />\nthe ideal.

I feel that if we<br />\ncontrol the ball, we'll win all our<br />\ngames. That's why we won last<br />\nFriday.\"<br />\nMandelbaum notes, however,<br />\nthat though ball control is the<br /><br />\nteam's strength in games, its<br />\ntogetherness is its overall strong<br />\npoint. \"I, along with assistant<br />\ncoach Mike Riley, have outside<br />\nresponsibilities to fulfill during<br />\nthe day. (Mandelbaum is a<br />\nstudent in the Dept. of<br />\nEnvironmental Medicine and<br />\nRiley's an insurance agent.) Many<br />\ntimes we can't get to practice<br />\nuntil four.

Mandelbaum<br />\ncredits DeDomenico as being a<br />\n\"stabilizing element\" in. the<br />\nmidfield providing leadership<br />\nboth in the games and in<br />\npractice.<br />\nThe other members of<br />\nDeDomenico's midfield are PJ<br />\nBoyle and Bob Gilroy. Boyle is a<br />\nsmooth player whose stickwork<br />\nand powerful crankshot give his<br /><br />\nmidfield a real offensive punch.<br />\nGilroy, who never played before<br />\ncoming to Hopkins, has vastly<br />\nimproved over last year and is<br />\nnoted for his hustling ability..<br />\nNo team can run with one<br />\nmidfield, of course, and Winston<br />\nHaydon, Rodger \"Ramjet\"<br />\nFitzgerald and veteran Mark<br />\nLewis run on the team's second<br />\nmidfield.
