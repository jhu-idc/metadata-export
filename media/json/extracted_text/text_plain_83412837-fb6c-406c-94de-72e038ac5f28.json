During<br />\nthe nine stanzas 29 Hopkins men<br />\nfaced Gaines, who pitched for<br />\nNavy. Jack Jones and Dick Benson were the only men of Eddie<br />\nHooper's squad to reach second,<br />\nand Dick was caught napping a<br />\nmoment later. The poor judgment<br />\nof flies on the part of Greenbaum<br />\nand Cox was one of the noticeable<br />\nfaults Of the game, these two men<br />\nletting four balls which could<br />\neasily have been caught had they<br />\nbeen awake, float oyer their heads,<br />\nhanding Navy five or six runs,<br />\nThe battle started off very inauspiciously for Navy. After Jones<br />\nhad reached first Blakeslee slammed a grounder ,to Littman, who<br />\nthrew to Bloomsburg, forcing<br />\nJones. The shortstop then tossed<br />\nthe ball to Purcell, .completing a<br />\nfast double play. The next batter<br />\nhit to Pythyon, who nabbed .him<br />\nat first.<br />\nPythyon pitched a great game<br />\nfor three rounds, but in the fourth,<br />\nafter Blakeslee had wiffed, Doyle<br />\ndropped a texas leaguer to left,<br />\nand. Von Heinburg knocked a high<br />\nfly which should easily have been<br />\ncaught by Greenbaum, but he allowed it to sail over his head for<br />\na two-bagger, tallying Doyle.<br />\nWelchel sacrificed Von Heinburg<br />\n.to third, and then Cox repeated<br />\nGreenbalun's bone play, letting<br />\nMilner stretch an easy out into<br />\na double, chalking up another<br />\nscore. Pino was out, Littman to<br />\nPurcell.<br />\n<br />\nOutweighed and outrun, the<br />\nVarsity Lacrosse Team put up a<br />\ngame fight last Saturday afternoon, and succeeded in holding the<br />\nIndians to a score of 4-1. The<br />\nCarlisle team has apparently not<br />\nsuffered much from the war, for<br />\na good number of their last year's<br />\nmen are back.<br />\nTheir midfield is very fast, and<br />\ntheir defense plays the same sure<br />\nhard game that all Indians defenses play. Captain Noni and<br />\nFred Walker are a great pair at<br />\nthe point positions.<br />\nThe Hopkins defense, too, did<br />\ngreat work, and plenty of it, for<br />\nthe Indians had all the endurance<br />\nin the world and were continually<br />\nbringing down extra men. Sadtler at goal, made many fine stops,<br />\nand<br />\n' used his speed to advantage<br />\nwhen the ball went outside of<br />\ngoal in getting the ball up the<br />\nfield. Morley, Meyer and Schmidt<br />\nformed a splendid trio on the close<br />\ndefense; in the last half, especially, putting up one of the prettiest exhibitions seen at Homewood for some time. The only<br />\ntrouble was that the midfield and<br />\nattack could not get away from<br />\nthe Indians.<br />\nVigal scored the first goal for<br />\nthe Indians shortly after play<br />\ncommenced, and then the Black<br />\nand Blue held for twenty minutes,<br />\nSadtler making some beautiful<br />\nstops. Near the last of the half,<br />\nhowever, Laige got one through<br />\nafter a sharp scrimmage in front<br />\nof goal.<br />\nThe Indians started the second<br />\nhalf with a rush, shooting two<br />\ngoals in the first few minutes.<br />\nWinslow then went in at third<br />\nattack, shifting Jarrett to center,<br />\nand the Varsity took quite a<br />\nbrace. Winslow's pep put new<br />\nspirit into the team, and they<br />\nheld the Indians after that, and<br />\nfinally worked the ball up to<br />\nStuart, who shot a pretty goal<br />\nfrom near the crease.<br />\nThe game was scrappily played<br />\nthroughout; there was a lot of<br />\nbody checking, especially in the<br />\nlast half, and the Varsity got a<br />\nsplendid workout in preparation<br />\nfor the two championship games<br />\nin store for them. They meet<br />\nPenn next week, and the Red and<br />\nBlue are more or less of an unknown quantity. Lehigh beat<br />\nthem 5-1, two weeks ago, but<br />\nPenn held the Crescents to a 4-4<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nPer cent.<br />\n1.000<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n.500<br />\n.000<br />\n<br />\nNorth C:Irolina, by winning<br />\nfrom the Virginia affirmative and<br />\nthe Hopkins negative teams, captured the debating honors for<br />\n1918, thereby breaking a long<br />\nstring of Hopkins victories. The<br />\nHopkins affirmative team (M. K.<br />\nRothschild and C. H. Miegel)<br />\nwon from Virginia at Chapel Hill,<br />\nN. C., but the negative team lost<br />\nto the Tar-Heel boys. Virginia<br />\nand North Carolina locked horns<br />\nin the C. E. Building at Homewood on Saturday night; North<br />\nCarolina winning by a vote of<br />\nfour to one.<br />\nThe attendance at the debate<br />\nat Hopkins was very poor, which,<br />\nhowever, did not prevent the debate from being a very spirited<br />\none, and it proved one of the best<br />\ndebates of the year. By a decision of four to one the University of North Carolina was declared the victor over the University of Virginia.<br />\nDr. John C. French, who presided, made the audience smile<br />\nwhen he said that one of the reasons for the small attendance<br />\nmight have been due to the cabman, who, when told to drive to<br />\nHopkins, takes you immediately<br />\nto the hospital. Dr. French was<br />\nalso in favor of conscripting,<br />\nwhile the debate was on the subject of labor conscription, of the<br />\nchauffeurs, to whom Dr. French<br />\nassigned the blame of the very<br />\nlate arrival of the musicians of<br />\nthe evening.<br />\nDr. Arthur B. Kinsolving, rector of Old St. Paul's phurch, was<br />\npresent at the debate to hear his<br />\nson, Arthur Lee Kinsolving, of the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia, who was<br />\none of the speakers. While Mr.<br />\nKinsolving, the younger, and his<br />\ncolleague, R. L. Garis, may have<br />\nbeen better in oratory and emotion<br />\nthan their opponents, M. B. Fowler and W. M.

The<br />\nuniversity in question was interested in this contest in only an indirect way\u2014through the fact that its representatives were contesting,<br />\nat the other two institutions. Yet there were more than three hundred student; who were interested in and attended the contest. They<br />\ngave both teams a rousing reception, honored the victors with their<br />\ncollege yells and expressed their personal appreciation to all of the<br />\ncontestants. The outsiders could not help but leave that college deeply<br />\nimpressed with the whole-hearted spirit of the reception they were<br />\ntendered; they could not have been more warmly received at their own<br />\ncolleges.<br />\nOn the same Saturday night at a certain university farther north,<br />\nthere took place an intercollegiate contest in which the representatives of two well-known, but outside, universities participated. The<br />\nuniversity in this case was interested in this contest in only an indirect way\u2014through the fact that its representatives were contesting at the other two institutions. But there were by actual count<br />\nfifteen students (and about four times as many outsiders) who attended this contest. We do not know\u2014we can only imagine\u2014with<br />\nwhat impressions the outsiders in this instance left this college.<br />\nThe reputation and fame of one of these colleges was enhanced;<br />\nthe reputation and fame of the other was slurred. We are telling no<br />\nsecret when we announce that one of these colleges was Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Highly Honored.<br />\nHopkins claims as her own the honors of all Hopkins men\u2014alumni,<br />\nfaculty, trustees and students; when a Hopkins man wins favorable<br />\nrecognition, Hopkins proudly feels that she has won favorable recognition. At the present time, the highest honor that can be paid any<br />\nman or any institution is a military honor. For these reasons, Hopkins may indeed feel proud of the high honor that was recently paid<br />\nits Commandant, Major George R. Guild, when he was appointed to<br />\n\"serve with the General Staff. It is a position of honor and a position<br />\nof responsibility for which few\u2014very, very few\u2014men are eligible and<br />\nto which still fewer men are appointed. It is a recognition of uncommon ability, faithful service, and unquestioned integrity. It is<br />\nindeed a high honor.<br />\nWe feel highly proud of our Commandant; we should try to be<br />\nworthy of him.<br />\n<br />\nMore Facts.<br />\nIn the baseball game with Navy on last Saturday, April 27, there<br />\nappeared in the box score of the Hopkins team the name of a man<br />\nwhich had been removed from the rolls of the University on<br />\nApril 25. On the same day, the name of a man who had left the University and had entered the service appeared in the summary of the<br />\nlacrosse game.

During<br />\nthe nine stanzas 29 Hopkins men<br />\nfaced Gaines, who pitched for<br />\nNavy. Jack Jones and Dick Benson were the only men of Eddie<br />\nHooper's squad to reach second,<br />\nand Dick was caught napping a<br />\nmoment later. The poor judgment<br />\nof flies on the part of Greenbaum<br />\nand Cox was one of the noticeable<br />\nfaults Of the game, these two men<br />\nletting four balls which could<br />\neasily have been caught had they<br />\nbeen awake, float oyer their heads,<br />\nhanding Navy five or six runs,<br />\nThe battle started off very inauspiciously for Navy. After Jones<br />\nhad reached first Blakeslee slammed a grounder ,to Littman, who<br />\nthrew to Bloomsburg, forcing<br />\nJones. The shortstop then tossed<br />\nthe ball to Purcell, .completing a<br />\nfast double play. The next batter<br />\nhit to Pythyon, who nabbed .him<br />\nat first.<br />\nPythyon pitched a great game<br />\nfor three rounds, but in the fourth,<br />\nafter Blakeslee had wiffed, Doyle<br />\ndropped a texas leaguer to left,<br />\nand. Von Heinburg knocked a high<br />\nfly which should easily have been<br />\ncaught by Greenbaum, but he allowed it to sail over his head for<br />\na two-bagger, tallying Doyle.<br />\nWelchel sacrificed Von Heinburg<br />\n.to third, and then Cox repeated<br />\nGreenbalun's bone play, letting<br />\nMilner stretch an easy out into<br />\na double, chalking up another<br />\nscore. Pino was out, Littman to<br />\nPurcell.<br /><br />\nOutweighed and outrun, the<br />\nVarsity Lacrosse Team put up a<br />\ngame fight last Saturday afternoon, and succeeded in holding the<br />\nIndians to a score of 4-1. The<br />\nCarlisle team has apparently not<br />\nsuffered much from the war, for<br />\na good number of their last year's<br />\nmen are back.<br />\nTheir midfield is very fast, and<br />\ntheir defense plays the same sure<br />\nhard game that all Indians defenses play. Captain Noni and<br />\nFred Walker are a great pair at<br />\nthe point positions.<br />\nThe Hopkins defense, too, did<br />\ngreat work, and plenty of it, for<br />\nthe Indians had all the endurance<br />\nin the world and were continually<br />\nbringing down extra men. Sadtler at goal, made many fine stops,<br />\nand<br />\n' used his speed to advantage<br />\nwhen the ball went outside of<br />\ngoal in getting the ball up the<br />\nfield. Morley, Meyer and Schmidt<br />\nformed a splendid trio on the close<br />\ndefense; in the last half, especially, putting up one of the prettiest exhibitions seen at Homewood for some time. The only<br />\ntrouble was that the midfield and<br />\nattack could not get away from<br />\nthe Indians.<br />\nVigal scored the first goal for<br />\nthe Indians shortly after play<br />\ncommenced, and then the Black<br />\nand Blue held for twenty minutes,<br />\nSadtler making some beautiful<br />\nstops. Near the last of the half,<br />\nhowever, Laige got one through<br />\nafter a sharp scrimmage in front<br />\nof goal.<br />\nThe Indians started the second<br />\nhalf with a rush, shooting two<br />\ngoals in the first few minutes.<br />\nWinslow then went in at third<br />\nattack, shifting Jarrett to center,<br />\nand the Varsity took quite a<br />\nbrace. Winslow's pep put new<br />\nspirit into the team, and they<br />\nheld the Indians after that, and<br />\nfinally worked the ball up to<br />\nStuart, who shot a pretty goal<br />\nfrom near the crease.<br />\nThe game was scrappily played<br />\nthroughout; there was a lot of<br />\nbody checking, especially in the<br />\nlast half, and the Varsity got a<br />\nsplendid workout in preparation<br />\nfor the two championship games<br />\nin store for them. They meet<br />\nPenn next week, and the Red and<br />\nBlue are more or less of an unknown quantity.

By a decision of four to one the University of North Carolina was declared the victor over the University of Virginia.<br />\nDr. John C. French, who presided, made the audience smile<br />\nwhen he said that one of the reasons for the small attendance<br />\nmight have been due to the cabman, who, when told to drive to<br />\nHopkins, takes you immediately<br />\nto the hospital. Dr. French was<br />\nalso in favor of conscripting,<br />\nwhile the debate was on the subject of labor conscription, of the<br />\nchauffeurs, to whom Dr. French<br />\nassigned the blame of the very<br />\nlate arrival of the musicians of<br />\nthe evening.<br />\nDr. Arthur B.

The<br />\nuniversity in question was interested in this contest in only an indirect way\u2014through the fact that its representatives were contesting,<br />\nat the other two institutions. Yet there were more than three hundred student; who were interested in and attended the contest. They<br />\ngave both teams a rousing reception, honored the victors with their<br />\ncollege yells and expressed their personal appreciation to all of the<br />\ncontestants. The outsiders could not help but leave that college deeply<br />\nimpressed with the whole-hearted spirit of the reception they were<br />\ntendered; they could not have been more warmly received at their own<br />\ncolleges.<br />\nOn the same Saturday night at a certain university farther north,<br />\nthere took place an intercollegiate contest in which the representatives of two well-known, but outside, universities participated. The<br />\nuniversity in this case was interested in this contest in only an indirect way\u2014through the fact that its representatives were contesting at the other two institutions. But there were by actual count<br />\nfifteen students (and about four times as many outsiders) who attended this contest. We do not know\u2014we can only imagine\u2014with<br />\nwhat impressions the outsiders in this instance left this college.<br />\nThe reputation and fame of one of these colleges was enhanced;<br />\nthe reputation and fame of the other was slurred. We are telling no<br />\nsecret when we announce that one of these colleges was Hopkins.<br /><br />\nHopkins Highly Honored.<br />\nHopkins claims as her own the honors of all Hopkins men\u2014alumni,<br />\nfaculty, trustees and students; when a Hopkins man wins favorable<br />\nrecognition, Hopkins proudly feels that she has won favorable recognition. At the present time, the highest honor that can be paid any<br />\nman or any institution is a military honor. For these reasons, Hopkins may indeed feel proud of the high honor that was recently paid<br />\nits Commandant, Major George R. Guild, when he was appointed to<br />\n\"serve with the General Staff. It is a position of honor and a position<br />\nof responsibility for which few\u2014very, very few\u2014men are eligible and<br />\nto which still fewer men are appointed. It is a recognition of uncommon ability, faithful service, and unquestioned integrity. It is<br />\nindeed a high honor.<br />\nWe feel highly proud of our Commandant; we should try to be<br />\nworthy of him.<br /><br />\nMore Facts.<br />\nIn the baseball game with Navy on last Saturday, April 27, there<br />\nappeared in the box score of the Hopkins team the name of a man<br />\nwhich had been removed from the rolls of the University on<br />\nApril 25. On the same day, the name of a man who had left the University and had entered the service appeared in the summary of the<br />\nlacrosse game. On the preceding Saturday, a certain man who was<br />\nno longer connected with the University as a student played for Hopkins in the game against Haverford.<br /><br />\nHopkins Freshmen.<br /><br />\nA.B.
