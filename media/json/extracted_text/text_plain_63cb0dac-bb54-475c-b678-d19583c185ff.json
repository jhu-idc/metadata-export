Of course, Ferdie Meyers has set the example by<br />\nthreatening marriage.

Spring time is upon us;<br />\nyea, even it is here, and by the<br />\nsame token I have seen strange<br />\nand wonderful sights which go to<br />\nshow that the young men at Hopkins are permitting themselves to<br />\nrun true to form. Of course, Ferdie Meyers has set the example by<br />\nthreatening marriage. That, I<br />\nthink, is carrying the custom of<br />\n\"obeying that impulse\" a wee bit<br />\nfar, I don't believe that aforesaid<br />\nold proverb intended Ferdie to do<br />\nanything quite so desperate.<br />\nBut the signs of the times are<br />\nbreaking out in milder forms here<br />\nand there. For instance, have you<br />\ntaken careful note of that pearl<br />\ngray creation which Vertrees<br />\nWyckoff proudly calls a hat? It<br />\nis truly a masterpiece of the art,<br />\none in a million, but even so, no<br />\nself-respecting male being would<br />\nvoluntarily of his own accord condescend to purchase such an article, much less to wear it. By<br />\nmy beard, he is under the spell of<br />\na fair maiden, as Kipling used to<br />\nsay (I believe it was Kipling),<br />\n\"look for the woman in the case.\"<br />\nBut this strange and peculiar<br />\ndisease affects both young and old.<br />\nIt plays no favorites, none are immune. They tell me that when<br />\n\"Ma\" Green takes leave of a beautiful lady nowadays, it is with<br />\nwords to this effect, \"Good-bye,<br />\nmy dear, and remember that the<br />\npresent Mrs. Green is not immortal.\"<br />\nThe taller they are the harder<br />\nthey fall, and following out this<br />\nline of reasoning, let me unfold<br />\nthe queer maneuvers that the<br />\nweather has caused one young gentleman to execute. Namely, Calkins, the boy the newspaper chaps<br />\nloved to dub \"the blond young<br />\ngiant,\" a regular two-fisted caveman, you know. They tell me he<br />\nhas 'been seen flashing his superb<br />\nphysique and wicked hair cut before the more or less admiring<br />\nbrown eyes of one of the fair sex,<br />\nwho condescends to grace the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building with her<br />\ncharming presence.

Eric says that when he<br />\ngoes to call in the evening he has<br />\nthe same sinking nervous sensation in the immediate vicinity of<br />\nhis floating ribs which was formerly aroused in him when \"Doc.\"<br />\nHulbert would say, \"Now for the<br />\npr-r-roblems.\" Another good man<br />\ngone wrong.<br />\nStill there is one consolation,<br />\nonly one wild woman can get you<br />\nat once.
