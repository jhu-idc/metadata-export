According to Section la of the<br />\nproposed Human Life Statute,<br />\nsponsored by Senator Jesse<br />\nHelms (R-NC), \"The Congress<br />\nfinds that the life of each human<br />\nbeing begins at conception.\"<br />\nWhere the Congress could find<br />\nthis is beyond the scope of<br />\nrealistic thinking, for no scientific or medical evidence has been<br />\n(and probably ever will be) able<br />\nto prove when life begins. Yet<br />\nmany conservative members of<br />\nCongress have used this \"fact\" as<br />\nthe basis for three proposed<br />\nconstitutional amendments and<br />\none proposed statute restricting<br />\n<br />\nor prohibiting., abortion. If,<br />\nwithin the next four weeks,<br />\nthese proposals are not brought<br />\nto a vote, they certainly will be<br />\nwhen Congress reconvenes in<br />\nJanuary. The decision will affect<br />\nthe life of every woman in the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nIn the mid-1800s, several<br />\nstates outlawed abortion. Such<br />\nlegislation was passed not to<br />\nprotect the rights of the unborn,<br />\nbut to safeguard the pregnant<br />\nwoman from the unsound medical procedures used in performing abortions. The decision in<br />\n1973 to leave the choice of<br />\nabortion up to a woman and her<br />\nphysician (Roe v. Wade) was<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\nThe GRO compliments the<br />\nNews-Letter on the attention it<br />\nhas given to security problems at<br />\nHopkins. As your recent survey<br />\nform shows, however, a focus on<br />\nsecurity personnel instead of<br />\nmore general areas of concern<br />\nleaves many questions unanswered.<br />\nWe would like to suggest<br />\nsome additional issues for your<br />\nconsideration. Your survey can<br />\nbe answered only by students<br />\nwho have encountered security<br />\nofficers regarding a specific<br />\ncomplaint. Many security problems, such as poor lighting on<br />\ncampus or inadequate locks in<br />\nUniversity apartments are not<br />\nissues a student calls campus<br />\nsecurity to resolve.<br />\nFor example, the Graduate<br />\nWomen's Committee surveyed<br />\ngraduate women last spring and<br />\nfound that 84% of the respondents did not feel safe on campus<br />\nat night, and 74% said traveling<br />\nto and from campus at night was<br />\na problem. These concerns<br />\nwould not show up on your<br />\nsurvey.<br />\nWe encourage you to supplement the survey you took<br />\nand address these larger, serious<br />\nconcerns that deserve the full<br />\nattention of the Hopkins community.<br />\nKathy Ogren<br />\n<br />\nunwittingly did me a huge favor<br />\nby removing the two rear wheels<br />\nand tires from my car last<br />\nSaturday night. You see, although my car (a '69 Cutlass)<br />\nhas lasted me very well since I<br />\ncame to Hopkins in 1977, it was<br />\nshowing unmistakeable signs of<br />\ndying within the next month or<br />\ntwo. You didn't know that the<br />\nair compressor had broken recently ($325 repair cost), that<br />\nthe front transmission seals<br />\nwere leaking ($250), or that the<br />\ntiming drain needed to be<br />\nreplaced ($200). You also didn't<br />\nknow that for these reasons, I<br />\nwas probably going to junk<br />\nmy car after this semester<br />\nanyway. In fact, my biggest<br />\ntrauma for the last few weeks<br />\nhas been that my car might<br />\nbreak down in the middle of<br />\nNew Jersey while driving up to<br />\nNew York for Thanksgiving or<br />\nChristmas. But, thanks to your<br />\nindustrious efforts, I no longer<br />\nhave to worry about this possibility or the costly repairs.

I<br />\nGRO Council<br />\n<br />\nwould like to suggest that a<br />\nfootbridge spanning the street<br />\nbetween 34th and 33rd streets<br />\nbe built. Not only would the<br />\nnew bridge provide a safe means<br />\nof crossing the street, but it<br />\nwould also enhance the beauty<br />\nof the Charles Village community.<br />\n\"But how,\" the astute observer may wonder, \"will the<br />\nUniversity or the community<br />\ngather the necessary funds?\"<br />\nHere enters the new spirit of<br />\nvoluntarism on campus that Ms.<br />\nEmily F.

I suggest<br />\ngathering about ten freshmen<br />\npre-meds, preferably those who<br />\nare not performing up to the<br />\nHopkins standards (Le., GPA<br />\nbelow 13). One Saturday night<br />\na conscientious upperclassman<br />\nwould treat them all to a night<br />\non the town.<br />\nUpon returning to campus,<br />\nthe upperclassman would lead<br />\nthe dreadfully drunk freshmen<br />\nto the edge of Charles Street and<br />\ntell them to cross.

His choice of<br />\n<br />\nThe Outside World<br />\nTake A Hike,Guys<br />\nBY ANDREW HURLEY<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nAs winter approaches and<br />\nIn recent weeks, different<br />\nstart to turn up their<br />\npeople<br />\nN-L departments have come<br />\nto keep warm, the<br />\nthermostats<br />\nunder some well deserved criticism. One department, however, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BG&E) is asking for its<br />\nlargest rate hike in 165 years. If<br />\nthe company is successful, and<br />\nthe Maryland Public Service<br />\nCommission grants BG&E the<br />\nthe unborn.\" A constitutional $199 million it is requesting, the<br />\namendment, not a statute, is average consumer's bill will<br />\nnecessary to reverse this deci- increase by 12 dollars a month.<br />\nFor the wealthy, a higher<br />\nsion.<br />\nthe energy bill may, at the most,<br />\nof<br />\nintent<br />\nThe<br />\nLife elicit a disgruntled moan about<br />\nGarn/Oberstar Human<br />\nAmendment is the same as the the continuing inflation. For<br />\nothers: to overrule the Roe v. the elderly and the poor, howWade decision. It is the most ever, it may mean choosing<br />\npopular version of all such between heat and food on the<br />\namendments among the anti- table. No one should have to<br />\nabortionists. If this amendment, make such _ a choice, but as<br />\nwere passed, the word \"person\" the Reagan policies continue to<br />\nwould include human beings, steal from the poor and give to<br />\nfetuses, and embryos, and both the rich, such choices have<br />\nthe Fifth and Fourteenth become reality.<br />\nThe latest BG&E rate hike<br />\namendments would apply to<br />\nsuch \"persons.\" The only case request is right in line with the<br />\nwhere abortion would be legal Reagan approach. Because of<br />\nwould be to prevent the death of the current rate structure, large<br />\nthe pregnant woman. Because of users of electricity pay less, per<br />\nthe definition of \"person\" in unit of energy, than do samller<br />\nSection 1, abortion would not residential customers.

In fact, in just one<br />\nyear after abortion became legal<br />\nin 1973, the mortality rate from<br />\nthis operation dropped 40 percent.<br />\nThis decision was also based<br />\non the \"right of privacy.\". In the<br />\ncase of Eisenstadt v. Baird<br />\n(extending the sale and use of<br />\ncontraceptives to unmarried persons), the Court said, \"If the<br />\nright of privacy means anything,<br />\nit is the right of the individual,<br />\nmarried or singly, to be free<br />\nfrom unwarranted governmental<br />\nintrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as<br />\nthe decision whether to bear or<br />\nbeget a child.\" In 1973, the<br />\nCourt extended its definition,<br />\nsaying, \"This right of privacy...is<br />\nbroad enough to encompass a<br />\nwoman's decision whether or<br />\nnot to terminate her pregnancy.\"<br />\nThe four bills now before<br />\nCongress -- the Human Life<br />\nAmendment<br />\nFederalism<br />\n(HLFA), sponsored by Senator<br />\nOrrin Hatch (R-Utah); the Human Life Statute (HLS), sponsored by Senator Helms; the<br />\nHuman Life Amendment(HLA),<br />\nsponsored by Representative<br />\nOberstar (D-Minn) and Representative Jake Garn (R-Utah);<br />\nand the Paramount \"Right to<br />\nLife\" Amendment (RLA), sponRepresentatives<br />\nby<br />\nsored<br />\nDorman (D-Calif), Gaydos (RPenn), and Paul (R-Texas), and<br />\nSenator Helms \u2014 all attempt to<br />\noverrule the Roe v. Wade decision, thereby rescinding the<br />\nwoman's right to privacy and her<br />\nprivilege to obtain a safe, legal<br />\nabortion.<br />\nThe HLFA gives the right to<br />\nrestrict and prohibit abortion to<br />\nboth Congress and the states<br />\n(with the more restrictive state<br />\nlaws governing). The stringency<br />\nof the law would vary from<br />\nCongress to Congress, thereby<br />\nforcing women to seek out<br />\n\"back-alley\" abortions during<br />\nthe times of a more conservative<br />\nCongress.<br />\n<br />\nOne seriously wonders if<br />\nJesse Helms' Human Life Statute<br />\nwas intended more for promoting his political career than for<br />\nserious legislative action. Aside<br />\nfrom Congress' great discovery<br />\nthat the life of each human<br />\nbeing begins at conception and<br />\nthat this \"human being\" is<br />\nprotected by the Fourteenth<br />\nAmendment of the Constitution,<br />\nthe Helms bill also provides that<br />\nall appeals must go to the<br />\nSupreme Court, which \"shall<br />\nadvance on its docket and<br />\nexpedite the disposition of any<br />\nsuch appeal.\" It would be<br />\nvirtually impossible for the<br />\nCourt to hear all such cases and<br />\nto act so expeditiously that it<br />\nwould still be possible for the<br />\nwoman to obtain a safe abortion, if the Court so decided. In<br />\nRoe v. Wade, the Supreme Court<br />\nstated that \"the word 'person,'<br />\nas used in the Fourteenth<br />\nAmendment, does not include<br />\n<br />\nThe Loop In \"The Entertainer\"<br />\nCOC41<br />\n<br />\n(77-10E's A NEAT arc!!<br />\nottfi AT\" TYE<br />\n10!iLEv4RO,AN.9<br />\n<br />\nTS<br />\n17-115 GEATH10E?<br />\nLooP !JERE<br />\n<br />\nMYSELF DOwN AND Do<br />\nSOME WORK!<br />\n<br />\nFox ToO,LONG<br />\n8EEN<br />\nLET7-ING THE TINIEST DISTmc<br />\nTONS KEEPHE FROM MY<br />\nSTUD IES/<br />\nAc Tu/91_ y<br />\n13EE\"-fLOOKIJc FOR<br />\nEXCUSES NOT TO WORK!<br />\n<br />\nrate hike is necessary. Its reason<br />\nhowever, is not claimed to be the<br />\nrising cost of fuel. As the<br />\ncompany explains in its rate hike<br />\napplication, it is because BG&E<br />\nwants to pay more money to its<br />\ninvestors, at the expense of<br />\nconsumers. To be sure, BG&E<br />\ndoes deserve some increase.<br />\nInflation has taken its toll on<br />\nBG&E and it does need some<br />\nmoney to raise their rate to<br />\nreturn on investment to 9.55%, a<br />\nrate that was previously granted<br />\nby the Public Service Commission. Yet most of the increase<br />\nwill go toward raising the<br />\nutility's rate of return from 9.55<br />\npercent to 11.5 percent.<br />\nIftwe don't raise our rate of<br />\nreturn to 11.5 percent, claims<br />\nBG&E, our investors will start<br />\nputting their money into money<br />\nmarkets and other stocks. That<br />\nis ridiculous. Right now, BG&E<br />\nis one of the nation's most<br />\nsecure investments. Value Line<br />\nrecently rated it among the top<br />\nhundred.

What about Humphrey Bogart,<br />\nwas he? Edward G. Robinson? Arthur<br />\nMiller? Come to Theatre Hopkins (in the<br />\nBarn) any weekend now through Dec. 6<br />\nand find out which of your favorite<br />\nHollywood stars were commies.<br />\nAre You Now Or Have You Ever<br />\nBeen is the dramatization of the actual<br />\ntranscripts of an investigation of the<br />\nentertainment industry by the UnAmerican Activities Committee from<br />\n1947-1956. Edward Bentley has handpicked and carefully arranged them into<br />\nsomething resembling a play.<br />\nAYNOHYEB begins with Sam<br />\nWood (director of Goodbye, Mr. Chips)<br />\ntelling the committee that the actors',<br />\ndirectors', and screenwriters' unions are<br />\nbeing run by communists. For the rest of<br />\nthe play various celebrities are hauled up<br />\nbefore the committee and questioned by<br />\nthe Inquisitors General. We slowly learn<br />\nthat sure enough there are some commies<br />\nin Show Biz, though they may not really<br />\nbe controlling the unions. In fact, anybody who's anybody went to a few party_<br />\nmeetings.<br />\nIn the first act, actors who used to<<br />\nbe party members in the early '40s are<br />\nbrought before the committee. Larry<br />\nParks, an All-American grass roots actor,<br />\nis a prime example. He feels guilty about<br />\n<br />\nhis party affiliation in the past, and has<br />\nsince repented his sins. The moral question for him is whether or not he should<br />\nrat on his colleagues who were similarly<br />\nled down Un-American paths. He fears he<br />\nwill ruin their careers (as his was ruined)<br />\nif he makes their names public.<br />\nAs the play progresses, those<br />\nbeing investigated become less and less<br />\nguilty about their own activities, and<br />\nmore suspicious of the committee's. Abe<br />\nBurrows, the author of Guys and Dolls,<br />\nbegins to undermine the committee's<br />\nprying with his intelligent honesty and<br />\nsharp wit. He is the first to admit that he<br />\ncould have been called a communist.<br />\nLionel Stander then dramatically shifts<br />\n<br />\nthe argument, claiming that the communists' activities were constitutionally justifiable, whereas the actions of the committee are not. In the final scene, with Paul<br />\nRobeson, the black singer-performer, the<br />\nargument completes its shift. Not only<br />\ndoes Robeson admit his sympathies with<br />\nthe communists (mostly due to their<br />\nacceptance of blacks as equals), he<br />\n<br />\nLarry Parks (left), played by Josh Shoemaker, consults his lawyer.<br />\n<br />\nJHU Orchestra Premieres AtShriver<br />\nBY BRUCE ALPERT<br />\nThe Hopkins Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Catherine<br />\nOverhauser, opened its first season last<br />\nSunday with a solid, and often exciting,<br />\nprogram of classical music.<br />\nPerforming in Shriver Hall to an<br />\naudience that filled the auditorium to<br />\napproximately three quarters of capacity,<br />\nthe orchestra treated its listeners to pieces<br />\nby Schubert, Beethoven, Ravel and<br />\nRimsky-Korsakov.. Its performance of each<br />\nwas admirable, winning the well-deserved<br />\naccolades of its audience.<br />\nThis first concert of the orchestra's first season began shortly after 3<br />\np.m. After a short welcoming speech by<br />\norchestra president Stephen Miller, concert master Mario Diaz tuned his orchestra for its first number, Franz Schubert's<br />\nOverture to \"Rosamunde,\" the accompaniment to Helmine von Chezy's 1823<br />\nplay. It was at this point that the concert's first, and only, minor mishap took<br />\nplace. For about three minutes both the<br />\norchestra and the audience sat in silence<br />\nas a backstage search for the conductor's<br />\nmusic took place. Presently, however,<br />\nOverhauser mounted her podium and<br />\ndirected her musicians into their first<br />\nperformance. One, or possibly two, of the<br />\nviolins were slightly off key, thus diminishing, ever-so-modestly, the beauty of<br />\nthe strings. Nonetheless, the rest of the<br />\norchestra performed extremely well,<br />\nfrequently rising to dramatic pinnacles. In<br />\nall, the opening piece was finely done,<br />\nsetting a favorable tone for the remainder<br />\nof the concert.<br />\nThe next piece was Ludwig van<br />\nBeethoven's Piano Concerto Number 3 in<br />\nC minor Opus 37. Thanks to the efforts<br />\nof pianist Annie D'Arco, the concerto<br />\nsoon turned out to be one of the concert's two high points. D'Arco, a graduate<br />\nof the Paris Conservatory of Music and<br />\nmember of the faculty of \"L'Ecole<br />\nNormale de Musique de Paris,\" gave a<br />\nspirited performance as she manipulated<br />\n<br />\nthe keyboard with visual as well as aural<br />\nelegance. As she performed each of the<br />\nconcerto's three movements with style<br />\nand feeling, the audience watched and<br />\nlistened with excitement, seizing the<br />\nbreaks between the movements to show<br />\ntheir appreciation with applause.<br />\nAfter the completion of the<br />\nconcerto, the audience called D'Arco<br />\nback to the stage twice before she mollified them with her encore, Gabriel<br />\nPierne's \"Concerto Study Opus 13.\" This<br />\nshe performed with the same vivacity that<br />\nwith the same vivacity tile marked her<br />\nperformance of Beethoven. When she<br />\nfinished, the audience again thundered its<br />\napproval, calling her three more times to<br />\nthe stage before the applause subsided.<br />\nReturning from intermission, the<br />\norchestra gave a fine performance of<br />\nMaurice Ravel's \"Pavane pour une Infante<br />\nDefunte\" (Pavane for a Dead Princess).<br />\nWhile the execution of the orchestra was<br />\nperhaps at its peak with this piece, it,<br />\nunfortunately, fell upon an audience still<br />\ngreen with the memory of the preceding<br />\nconcerto. And, as it turned out, what<br />\nimpressions were formed of the Pavane<br />\nwould be dealt a further blow by the<br />\npiece that would follow it.<br />\nThe last number of the concert,<br />\nand the performance's second high point,<br />\nwas Nicolai Rimslcy-Korsakov's \"Capriccio Espanol, Opus 34,\" a piece RimskyKorsakov himself called \"a brilliant<br />\ncomposition for the orchestra.\" While<br />\norchestra president Stephen Miller privately concedes that \"parts of the<br />\nRimsky-Korsakov came off rather sloppy,\" little, if any, of this was noticeable to<br />\nthe audience in general. In fact, this final<br />\npiece seemed an exciting work of orchestration through which the symphony<br />\ndemonstrated its dramatic prowess.<br />\nMinor flaws detracted somewhat<br />\nfrom the concert. Unfortunately, the<br />\ngrand piano was placed directly in front<br />\nof the conductor and, when opened,<br />\ncompletely obstructed the audience's<br />\nview of the orchestra. Given the limita-<br />\n<br />\ntions of the Shriver stage, however, it<br />\nappears that little could have been done<br />\nto prevent this. The second flaw was<br />\nquite avoidable. There was no consistency<br />\nin dress among the members of the<br />\norchestra. It was very disconcerting to see<br />\nthat each musician had his own style and<br />\ncolor clothing. While this did not diminish the fine performance, it did give the<br />\norchestra a rag-tag appearance that<br />\nbetrdyed its otherwise professional demeanor.<br />\ncont. on p. 15<br />\n<br />\naccuses the committee of being NeoFascist.<br />\nThe fact that the play was based<br />\nstrictly on actual transcripts makes the<br />\nplay historically fascinating but dramaturgically uninteresting. The first act<br />\nfloods the audience with a myriad of<br />\nnames and faces, many of which will be<br />\nunfamiliar to the viewer. Some witnesses<br />\nwere not acted out, but their words were<br />\nmerely taped, which left the actors on<br />\nstage with nothing to do. The painful and<br />\nmonotous questioning of countless witnesses grows very tiresome. The courtroom setting is claustrophobic and the<br />\naction is confined to armchairs. Though<br />\nthere is no rising action (only a compiling<br />\nof data), the witnesses do get progressively more interesting and animated. The<br />\nfirst act is very long and the acting is not<br />\ngood enough to plug the holes of a<br />\nsinking ship.<br />\nThe second act, however, begins<br />\nwith the witty dialogue and lively acting<br />\nof Abe Burrows(Ken Hayward). By now,<br />\nthose of the audience whose minds didn't<br />\nstray or doze off in act one have compiled enough facts to understand elements of the truth behind communist<br />\nactivities in the entertainment industry.<br />\nRalph Piersanti delivered a strong performance of Lionel Stander, and the play<br />\nends with a fine portrayal of Paul<br />\nRobeson by Edward Heath. The pathos<br />\nevoked by Robeson in his brilliant<br />\nspeeches and his courageous evocation of<br />\nthe Fifth Amendment is the antithesis of<br />\nthe lifeless first act.<br />\nThe play clearly made one feel<br />\nlike communists aren't so bad; in fact,<br />\nmany of our favorite actors were reds.<br />\nFor this reason, and the reason that the<br />\nplay as a historical document is educational, Are You Now Or Have You Ever<br />\nBeen is worth seeing. But be fprewarned:<br />\nit is 21<br />\n/<br />\n2 hours long, and it seems like<br />\nthree.<br />\n<br />\nIn The Realm OfThe Censors<br />\nBY DOREEN MORAN<br />\nIt was a most stimulating weekend, a weekend of sex and yet more sex<br />\n\u2014 namely, in the films Debbie Does<br />\nDallas, at Hopkins, and In The Realm of<br />\nthe Senses, at The Charles. Those of you<br />\nwho saw Debbie may draw your own<br />\nconclusions; personally, I feel there is<br />\nonly so many times you can watch<br />\nsomeone go down on someone else before<br />\nyou get a bit bored. But Debbie has come<br />\nand gone amidst a weekend of threatened<br />\nraids and broken film. Realm, however,<br />\nwill continue for yet another two midnight showings this Friday and Saturday.,<br />\nFor those of you whose first experience<br />\nwith X-rated films was Debbie, give it<br />\nanother chance with Realm.

Kichi is an older man with one hell<br />\nof a body who blatantly initiates the<br />\nrelationship with her.<br />\nSada's past as a whore has been<br />\nalluded to earlier, so (remembering the<br />\nunenlightened views of the early-century<br />\nJapanese toward sex) it does not seem<br />\nincongruous that she so readily accepts<br />\nhim. The real reason, however, is shortly<br />\n<br />\napparent: Sada is one horny lady.<br />\nAlthough equally intense to a<br />\npoint, Kichi, it must be remembered,is a<br />\nman and has the propensity to come but<br />\nonce. Sada, however, forgets this. The<br />\ntwo neither eat nor drink for days: sex is<br />\ntheir nourishment, and while Kichi does<br />\nallow himself to sleep, Sada most often<br />\ndoes not. We can often find her performing fellatio on the sleeping Kichi or<br />\nstaring at him adoringly.<br />\nTheir common \u2022 one-track mind<br />\nincreasingly isolates them from society.<br />\nAs women (other geishas) begin to look<br />\ndown upon Sada, she and Kichi become<br />\nmore flagrant about their lovemaking,<br />\nstartling the very people who criticize<br />\ntheir actions even more when,in mid-conversation, one of them will throw up the<br />\nkimono of the other and begin another<br />\ngrueling sex marathon regardless of who<br />\nis watching.<br />\nIt gets to the point, though, where<br />\nthey can do only so much of one thing<br />\nbefore they become bored and variation<br />\nis necessary (think back on Debbie).<br />\nNeither Kichi nor Sada is adverse to<br />\nfinding the ultimate pleasure. Our first<br />\nglimpse of the result \u2014 sado-masochism \u2014<br />\ncomes when Sada prostitutes herself to a<br />\nhigh school principal.

When she was a junior, she<br />\nhad a show at a Fells Point art gallery. She sold a<br />\nfew pieces of work, which bolstered her confidence in bringing her'art to the public.

I said<br />\ngood-bye to Sarah-Jane and felt relieved to be<br />\ngetting out,<br />\nNow I tried to prepare myself for a<br />\nUniversity homecoming. I remembered why I<br />\nalmost hadn't gone away for the weekend. There<br />\nis something to be said for keeping in motion at<br />\nall times. Once I've established my home and<br />\nlifestyle, breaking the routine destroys momenturn. I begin to doubt. My separation anxiety is<br />\ncaused by imagining how it will feel to be back<br />\nin classes and in my apartment. I recalled my<br />\npre-departure procedures before leaving Baltimore. I had organized my books and packed and<br />\nrepacked my clothes three times. I thought<br />\nabout saying good-byes. Usually I avoid goodbyes. I say, \"I'll probably see you before I go.\"<br />\nBut I never even attempt to say good-bye.<br />\nSometimes I wonder what would happen if I<br />\n<br />\nwere to have a train crash or were kidnapped<br />\nand never saw my friends again. Good-byes are<br />\nsad, and make me lose momentum even faster. I<br />\ntried a good-bye on my friend Dinah's cat, Pang,<br />\nwho was staying at my apartment over the<br />\nweekend because Dinah's sister, who was visiting, was allergic to cats.<br />\n\"I'll probably see you before I leave. I<br />\nwon't say good-bye now.\" I said it in a casual<br />\ntone of voice, trying to be unemotional. Pang,<br />\nwho doesn't suffer from separation anxiety,<br />\nlooked at me indifferently. \"If anything happens<br />\nto me,\" I added, \"this apartment is yours.\" I<br />\nyelled good-bye to him again just as I left, but<br />\nhe stayed at the window, crouched by the<br />\ncurtain.<br />\nThat might be a way to eliminate separation anxiety: if I got a cat, I reasoned, I<br />\nwouldn't come home to an empty apartment. I<br />\nwould learn to say good-bye without feeling<br />\nanguish, and the fear of coming home and losing<br />\nmomentum and forgetting why I was in college<br />\nwouldn't be as bad if I knew someone like Pang<br />\nwas waiting for me, depending on me for survivat. Dinah's relationship with Pang definitely<br />\nmade me consider sharing my apartment with a<br />\ncat. Pang proved too restless for my pace, and<br />\nafter Dinah told of how Pang had swallowed two<br />\npennies and needed an operation which cost<br />\nmore than a hundred dollars, I decided I would<br />\n<br />\nstay single. Why, I wondered, did he swallow<br />\ntwo pennies? Did he eat one with gusto as an<br />\nappetizer, and a second as dessert? Did he<br />\nswallow them whole, like sleeping pills when he<br />\nwas in a suicidal mood? Before I left the apartment I hid all my pennies (just in case) and all<br />\nmy socks. Pang likes to masturbate with socks.<br />\nThat was days \u2014 seemingly weeks \u2014 ago,<br />\nand now it was Monday, and I was about to<br />\nenter academia again. The bus stopped behind<br />\nShriver. I got out, and walked towards my<br />\napartment. A question annoyed me as I climbed<br />\nthe stairs. Why do apartment buildings always<br />\nsmell of Raid and cooked broccoli? It's a lethal<br />\ncombination which is sometimes joined by<br />\nbacon smoke or carpet lint. Coming home, in<br />\nmy mind, will always be linked with the eternal<br />\nsmell of broccoli in hallways. Maybe all vegetables, when boiled properly, smell like broccoli.<br />\nMaybe at the end of the world, the wind will<br />\nblow the scent of Raid and cooked broccoli<br />\nbefore the lights go out and C&P Telephone cuts<br />\noff service.<br />\nI unlocked my apartment and dropped<br />\nmy pack on the bed. Pang, crouched by the ,<br />\nwindow in the same pose as when I'd left him,<br />\nlooked at me and opened his mouth, releasing a<br />\nsilent but somehow tragic cry. Then I saw it. On<br />\nthe floor by the desk, curled like a limp sidewalk<br />\nworm, lay a lone blue wool sock.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 / NOVEMBER 20, 1981<br />\n<br />\n\"Ilie Johns I lopkins University Office of Special Events presents<br />\n<br />\n'THE WINTER SOI\u201eSTK:E<br />\n\\MOLE EAZ\"Jai CI IRIS'!'\\1AS CELEBRAFION<br />\n<br />\nRATHSKELLAR<br />\nLevering Hall<br />\nHOT BUFFET<br />\nEvery Tuesday and Wednesday<br />\n11:30 2:00<br />\nIMPORTED BEERS NOW AVAILABLE<br />\nMolson<br />\nErlanger<br />\nTuborg-Light and Dark<br />\nLowenbrau Dark<br />\nHappy Hour<br />\nEvery Friday<br />\n<br />\nLadies Night<br />\nEvery Saturday<br />\n<br />\n4:30-8:30 P.M.<br />\n2 for 1 on ALL<br />\nDraft-Wine-Soda<br />\nIn Cups<br />\n<br />\nAll Beer-Wine-Soda<br />\nPitcher and Cup<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n2 Price<br />\nMonday Night<br />\nFootball<br />\nOpen 'Til Game is Over<br />\nAll Draft Beer - 65 cents<br />\nAll Pitchers of Beer - $2.75<br />\n<br />\nA Spectacular Concert in a Spectacular Cathedral Setting by<br />\n<br />\nNew Hours - Monday - Friday<br />\n4:30 - 8:00 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nCONSORT<br />\nWINTER<br />\nTHEPAUL\u2018Vith<br />\nVocalist Susan Osborn<br />\nR I DAY.

A fitting occasion, for it<br />\nwas indeed a \"game of the<br />\ncentury\" \u2014 a nerve-wracking<br />\ncontest from start to finish with<br />\none of the freakiest endings<br />\nin Hopkins' or anyone else's<br />\nhistory. Final score: Johns Hopkins 20, Western Maryland 14 \u2014<br />\nthe Jays' first win in this longtime rivalry (dating back to<br />\n1894) since 1975.<br />\nFor Joe Nador and the<br />\nreturnees from 1980's 1-8 team,<br />\nthe moral of the story was:<br />\nthere's always a chance for<br />\nredemption. While it had been a<br />\nlong, tough year for Nador, the<br />\nBlue Jays' placekicker, after<br />\nthis game was over an embarrassed Nador received a bear hug<br />\nfrom Hopkins athletic director<br />\nBob Scott, who called him \"the<br />\nman who pounced on it.\"<br />\nWhat Nador pounced on<br />\noccurred with just over a minute<br />\nremaining \u2014 certainly a play for<br />\nthe annals. With the score<br />\ndeadlocked at 14, Nador was<br />\ncalled upon to try a 31-yard<br />\nfield goal that would put the<br />\nJays in front. But Pat Luce, the<br />\nGreen Terrors' defensive star of<br />\nthe day, charged through and<br />\ngot a hand on the kick. Tom<br />\nKnieriem picked it up for the<br />\nTerrors and swept right; facing a<br />\nwall of tacklers, he brashly tried<br />\nto lateral it on the run to teammate Rick Conner, but he<br />\nmissed and Nador, alertly pursuing, covered the ball on the<br />\nWestern Maryland one-yard line.<br />\n\"Nador caught some criticism for not getting the field<br />\ngoals,\" said coach Jerry Pfeifer.<br />\n\"But on two of his kickoffs he<br />\nmade long-gain-saving, maybe<br />\ntouchdown-saving, tackles. He<br />\nmade three great plays and it<br />\nwas only through effort that he<br />\nmade them. I thought Joe really<br />\nnailed the ball, and I thought it<br />\nwas going to be a good field<br />\ngoal. We made a mistake in our<br />\nblocking. My reaction (to the<br />\nscore) was of it being God-sent,<br />\nbecause I didn't have anything<br />\nto do with it.- Two plays later,<br />\nthe crowd ot about 3000 erupted a second time when Jim<br />\nMargraff carried the ball over the<br />\ngoal line for the decisive, .stunning score.<br />\nMemorable as that series of<br />\nevents was, the one that occurred with 8:48 remaining in<br />\nthe third quarter may be<br />\nlonger,<br />\neven<br />\nremembered<br />\ncertainly by the NCAA. Margraff<br />\nfaded back and floated a high<br />\npass 20 yards downfield toward<br />\nthe right sideline, where Bill<br />\nStromberg outjumped the coverage and pulled it down just<br />\ninbounds. The catch was the<br />\n254th of Stromberg's Hopkins<br />\ncareer, breaking Chris Myers'<br />\nDivision III career receiving<br />\nrecord with less than 30 minutes<br />\nremaining in Stromberg's time as<br />\na Blue Jay football player.<br />\nThe game was stopped as<br />\nrealization came, and<br />\nthe<br />\nStromberg was presented with<br />\nthe historic ball and received<br />\ncongratulations from his teammates.<br />\nStromberg played his last<br />\n<br />\nHopkins game in typical Stromberg style. He didn't see too Much<br />\ndouble coverage, but the coverage he had \u2014 primarily Luce or<br />\nKnieriem \u2014 stayed with Stromberg virtually step for step most<br />\nof the time. Not quite close<br />\n<br />\nreceivers open and feeling a<br />\nstrong pass rush from Wayne<br />\nKeen and George Probeyhan,<br />\nMargraff made repeated errant<br />\npasses early on and finished the<br />\nfirst half with only eight completions in 22 attempts.<br />\n<br />\nback Jim Johnson and forced a<br />\nfumble that Dan Burns pounced<br />\non to give the Jays the ball at<br />\nthe Terror 33. Two 13-yard<br />\ncompletions, the first to Stromberg and the second to Doug<br />\nMay, and a pass interference call<br />\n<br />\n25 yards to the Hopkins 15<br />\nbefore being brought down.<br />\nThen, facing third and 11,<br />\nSelfridge bootlegged around<br />\nright end down to the one, from<br />\nwhere he scored the first of his<br />\ntwo touchdowns.<br />\nThe Jays used almost seven<br />\nminutes to retake the lead after<br />\nhalftime. A suddenly revitalized<br />\nrunning game allowed Hopkins<br />\nto drive to the Terror 37, from<br />\nwhere Margraff unloaded to<br />\nStromberg for ; the record-setting catch. After three incomplete passes, the Jays went for it<br />\non fourth down;Stromberg beat<br />\nthe coverage, took another high<br />\nlob, and ran in untouched.<br />\nThe lead didn't last very<br />\nlong, as the Terrors tied the<br />\nscore at 14 on their next possession after Conner returned the<br />\nkickoff to midfield. Selfridge hit<br />\nreceiver/kicker Rich Johnson<br />\nthree times, good for 38 yards \u2014<br />\nthe last a difficult sideline catch<br />\nat the Hopkins nine. From the<br />\none<br />\nSelfridge ran it in<br />\nuntouched.<br />\n<br />\nConner quickly gave the<br />\nThe Blue Jays celebrate after completing a 7-2 season.<br />\nTerrors another opportunity by<br />\nAgain, the Jay defense rose in the end zone set up Bot intercepting a Margraff pass and<br />\nenough, however. Stromberg<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\noccasion in the first half. Sternfeld's seventh touchdowr returning it to the Hopkins 30.<br />\nto<br />\nseemingly always managed<br />\nDon<br />\nFielder picked up 26 of the year, a one-yard plunge. On the next play, Selfridge had<br />\nAfter<br />\ndown<br />\ncoming<br />\nfind some way of<br />\nwith any ball thrown his way;in yards in his first two carries, the Nador's kick made it 7-0. Andy Baum open near the goal<br />\nThe Terrors got one first- line, but overthrew him and Jeff<br />\none eye-opener, he was knocked Terror offens-: became equally<br />\ndown, the pass tipped \u2014 and he sluggish and felt an equally half drive going and used it to Kendall snared the pass for<br />\nstill somehow caught it while on strong pass rush.

In between,<br />\nHopkins has not had a winning<br />\nseason.<br />\nDespite a 12-12 record last<br />\nyear (after two dismal campaigns), the Jays had a disapThe Jays<br />\npointing finish.<br />\nstarted off in a hole, 14, losing<br />\nto three non-Division III schools:<br />\nWake Forest, Virginia Tech and<br />\nLoyola. However, the Jays got<br />\non track, reeling off an eightgame winning streak. In that<br />\nstreak, Hopkins won two tournament championships.<br />\nThe second half of the<br />\nseason was a different story.<br />\nPlaying inconsistent basketball,<br />\nthe Jays lost eight of theii<br />\nlast twelve games. Unfortunately, nine of those games were<br />\nagainst conference rivals. Hopkins wound up 4-6 in the MAC<br />\nSouth.<br />\nThis year, the Jays will once<br />\nagain open the season in a hole,<br />\nprobably losing their first two<br />\ncontests. The Jays have little<br />\nchance against Virginia Tech and<br />\nVirginia Commonwealth, two<br />\nDivision I schools that made the<br />\nNCAA playoffs two years ago.<br />\nThe Jays will chalk up another<br />\nloss January 6, when they travel<br />\ndown to Winston-Salem to take<br />\non nationally ranked Wake ForLast year, the Demon<br />\nest.<br />\nDeacons buried Hopkins 111-58.<br />\nIn the MAC South, Widener<br />\nwill probably be the team to<br />\n<br />\nbeat. The Jays have not beaten<br />\nWidener in three years. Ursinus,<br />\nwhich made it to the Division III<br />\nsemifinals last year, won't be as<br />\nThe Jays<br />\ntough this year.<br />\nshouldn't have too much trouble<br />\nwith Haverford or Swarthmore,<br />\nbut they always have problems<br />\nwith Washington College. Washington, 3-7 in the MAC South<br />\nlast season, beat the Jays twice.<br />\nUnder new coach Nappy<br />\nDoherty, the Jays will be a little<br />\ndifferent than they were last<br />\nyear under Jim Amen. The Jays<br />\nwill go with two guards, rather<br />\nthan with a point guard. As a<br />\nresult, the Jays will run more<br />\nand employ the fast break more<br />\noften. In addition, Doherty has<br />\ngiven the green light to all his<br />\nplayers to shoot if they have an<br />\nopen shot.<br />\nThis year's Hopkins squad<br />\nappears to be improved over last<br />\nseason's 12-12 team. The Blue<br />\nJays' key asset will be experience. The team is mostly a<br />\nveteran squad, with only three<br />\nnewcomers: freshman Michael<br />\nSullivan, sophomore Michael<br />\nSnider (who played on the<br />\njunior varsity last year) and<br />\njunior Chris McShea, a transfer<br />\nfrom Holy Cross. McShea,6'3\",<br />\nwho practiced with the Jays last<br />\nyear but was red-shirted, is the<br />\nkey addition to the squad.<br />\nThe probable starting forward line for the Jays will consist of three players will provide the bulk of the scoring.<br />\nTessitore, 6'3\", is the captain of the team and a fourthyear starter. He will switch to<br />\nthe small forward position this<br />\nyear. Tessitore has been the<br />\nmost consistent Jay over the<br />\npast three years. Last year, he<br />\nwas second in scoring, averaging<br />\n10.6 points. He was also second<br />\non the team in rebounding.<br />\nNikic, 6'6\", was the Jays'<br />\n<br />\nJay women during practice<br />\n<br />\nleading scorer last season, tallying 11.5 points per game. Despite a midseason slump, Nikic<br />\nhad a career-high 31 points<br />\nagainst Haverford in the secondto-last game fo the season.<br />\nNikic is a good outside shooter<br />\n<br />\nthree-point play at the buzzer.<br />\nBarr averaged 5.8 points overall,<br />\nbut averaged 8.3 points in MAC<br />\ngames. However, he is suspect on<br />\ndefense.<br />\n<br />\npotent scoring threat, as witnessed by his 31 -point effort in<br />\nthe Blue-White intrasquad scrimmage on Tuesday.<br />\nThe guard spot has provided<br />\nlittle scoring in the past. However, starting guards Scott Barr<br />\n<br />\nScott Kautz, rarely shooting<br />\n'the ball last season,led the team<br />\nwith 3.5 assists per game.<br />\nHe ran the team from the point<br />\nguard position. Kautz, 5'11\",<br />\nan excellent rebounder<br />\nis<br />\nfor his size and hustles consistently, often diving after loose<br />\nballs. Look for him to shoot<br />\nmore this season.<br />\nWith coach Doherty carrying only an eleven-man squad,<br />\nthe bench should see a great deal<br />\nof action. Up front, the Jays<br />\nexpect good seasons from sophomore Robert Clayton, junior<br />\nKarl Hakmiller, senior Nelson<br />\nFile and sophomore Michael<br />\nSnider. Clayton,<br />\n6'5\" ,is an<br />\nexcellent rebounder and strong<br />\noff the offensive<br />\nboards.<br />\nHakmiller, 6' 7\", is also a good<br />\nleaper and an excellent shooter.<br />\nFile,<br />\n6'2\", and<br />\nSnider,<br />\n6'2\", are both small forwards.<br />\nFile, used sparingly last year,<br />\nmay also see some action at the<br />\n2 guard position. Snider, an excelt=t<br />\n< lent outside shooter, could be<br />\nthe team's zone breaker.<br />\n<br />\nWall,<br />\nSophomore Glenn<br />\nSophomore Bob Clayton (right) goes for the block.<br />\nwill be the first guard<br />\nand Scott Kautz, both seniors, 5'10\",<br />\nand hits the boards well.<br />\nMcShea, despite being a are steady, consistent ballplay- off the bench. Wall is an excellent ballhandler and shooter..<br />\nnewcomer, is regarded as a lead- ers.<br />\nSullivan.<br />\nLast year, Barr had several Freshman Michael<br />\ner by his teammates. An aggrescharge<br />\nfourth<br />\nguard<br />\nthe<br />\ntaking<br />\non the<br />\ngames,<br />\nis<br />\noutstanding<br />\n6'2\",<br />\nsive player, he is very strong inside and will strengthen the Jays' in clutch situations. He beat squad. He is a quick, solid<br />\nrebounding. McShea is also a Swarthmore, 63-62, with a ballhandler and shooter.<br />\n<br />\nNew Players Key For Women<br />\nBY RAMAN BET-MANSOUR<br />\nWomen's basketball at Hopkins has never had anything to<br />\nboast about. It has never been a<br />\nMAC power, nor has it ever<br />\nstarted any season with high<br />\nhopes. After all, it has never had<br />\na full-time coach. Last year's<br />\n3-12 record was indicative of the<br />\nteam's performance.<br />\nBut this year things look<br />\ndifferent. For the first time<br />\nthere is a full-time coach, Kay<br />\nFowler, who has proven her<br />\neffectiveness as a coach by<br />\nleading the Hopkins women's<br />\ntennis team to the MAC championship earlier in the year.<br />\nThere are also many new,<br />\nexciting players who will make<br />\nthe team more competitive. The<br />\nteam has two very good ballhandlers in Liz Hirschhorn, a<br />\nGeraldine<br />\nand<br />\nsophomore,<br />\nKlauber, a transfer from Trinity<br />\nCollege. Both are very adept at<br />\nmaking passes, creating opportunities for teammates, and<br />\nare able to direct the flow of the<br />\ngame. Celeste DiBatiste will be<br />\ncounted on to play center, as<br />\nthe sophomore is an excellent<br />\nrebounder and can move people<br />\nout of the way.<br />\nThere are four returning<br />\nforwards, each with a different<br />\nrole on the team. Cheryl Baron,<br />\na junior, will be counted on for<br />\nrebounds. The coach is depending on Amy Buchanon to do<br />\n<br />\nmuch of the scoring, as she is a<br />\ngood shooter, and was one of<br />\nthe high-scorers on last year's<br />\nsquad. Kim Stevens, another<br />\njunior who was ill much of last<br />\nyear, will be trying to fill in at<br />\nthe small forward spot. Sue<br />\nTyler is the only senior on the<br />\nsquad, and she will be expected<br />\nto lead the younger and more<br />\ninexperienced players.<br />\nFowler is also depending on<br />\nthe performance and maturity of<br />\nDawn Richards, a freshman. She<br />\nwill be playing at the forward<br />\nspot, and will be a big asset to<br />\nthe rebounding and scoring.<br />\nFowler thinks she is an excellent<br />\nall-around athlete.<br />\nFowler believes she has<br />\nenough depth on her team so<br />\nthat she will not have to worry<br />\nabout injury or foul trouble. She<br />\nalso continues to believe that the<br />\nstrength of the team lies in its<br />\nshooting, a fine blend of inside<br />\nand outside shooters including<br />\nAmy Buchanon, Dawn Richards,<br />\nand Geraldine Klauber. However<br />\nshe will depend on an exciting,<br />\nfast-breaking offense for most of<br />\nthe points.<br />\n<br />\nbasket. Celeste DeBatiste will be<br />\nplaying center in the middle of<br />\nthe defense, with Amy Buchanon and Dawn Richards on the<br />\nwings. The 1-3-1 is an exhilarating defense, as it is based upon a<br />\nlot of pressing and playing the<br />\npassing lanes. If played correctly, with a lot of hustle, it will<br />\ncreate a great many turnovers.<br />\nThe team should also be able to<br />\nrebound very well off of it,<br />\nwhich in turn will result in a<br />\ngreat many fast-break opportunities.<br />\n<br />\nWhat is most different<br />\nabout this year's team from the<br />\nprevious years ia a new attitude,<br />\none of accomplishment and<br />\nself-confidence. The players are<br />\nhoping for a winning season, as<br />\nthey all believe that they will be<br />\nrespectable. Co-captain Amy<br />\nBuchanon said,\"We will definitely be a respected team, much<br />\nbetter than last year, as we will<br />\ndefeat most of our opponents.<br />\nWe will not be walkeu upon.<br />\nThere are a lot of good new<br />\nplayers, sophomores who did<br />\nnot go out last year, new freshmen, and transfers. And we are<br />\nAgainst inexperienced teams not really weak in anything.\"<br />\nwho are not able to handle the The team has been working very<br />\nball well, the team will be hard for the past three weeks, as<br />\nplaying a man-to-man defense. 18 people tried out, but only 12<br />\nHowever, the basic defense will now remain. Fowler believes<br />\nbe the 1-3-1 zone. Geraldine that her team is ready and in<br />\nKlauber will be playing up top, shape, but also that it is still<br />\nwith Liz Hirschhorn under the improving.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 20!

He has a<br />\nbatting average of more than<br />\n.300 for three years, was 32 for<br />\n32 on stolen base attempts as a<br />\nsophomore and is a fine fielding<br />\nshortstop who runs a 4.5 forty.<br />\nIt's likely that he'll be drafted<br />\nby teams from the NFL and/or<br />\n<br />\nBlue JayHaniersFinish<br />\nThe men's cross country<br />\nteam ended its season Saturday<br />\nat the NCAA Mideast Division<br />\nIII Championships.

He placed 60th in<br />\na very competitive field of more<br />\nthan 150.<br />\nCo-captain John Roemer<br />\nwas eight seconds back,finishing<br />\n64th. His 26:56 over 8,000<br />\nmeters was only a slight improvement over last week.<br />\n\"Unfortunately, I run better<br />\nthan most when conditions are<br />\npoor,\" Roemer said. \"The hills<br />\ndidn't work to my advantage<br />\neither, since no one faded on the<br />\nclimbs.

During<br />\n<br />\nfreshman year, also had an<br />\ninjured elbow. He had ruptured<br />\nthe bursar sac in the elbow of his<br />\nright (throwing) arm during the<br />\nprevious Saturday's win over<br />\nMuhlenberg, and the resulting<br />\nfluid build-up and inflammation<br />\n<br />\nStromberg and Margra f a<br />\nthe season finale against Western<br />\nMaryland, Stromberg's right elbow was swelled to twice its<br />\nnormal size. And when he made<br />\nhis record-breaking reception,<br />\nStromberg appeared to have the<br />\nwind knocked out of him when<br />\nhe landed on the sideline. But<br />\nStromberg had actually fallen on<br />\nhis injured elbow and didn't get<br />\nup until his teammates came<br />\nover to congratulate him. One of<br />\nthe first to help Stromberg up<br />\nwas Jim Margraff.<br />\nMargraff, who's been throwing to Stromberg since their<br />\n<br />\nter record-breaking catch<br />\ncreated swelling between the<br />\nligaments and cartilage. Margraff<br />\ndidn't practice the first three<br />\ndays of the week, and Thursday<br />\nhe finally got the clearance to<br />\nplay.<br />\nAnd play he did. With a<br />\nprotective sleeve which restricted the bending of his arm,<br />\nMargraff lofted passes to his<br />\nreceivers. But the bomb was no<br />\nlonger a threat to the Western<br />\nMaryland defense, whose secondary seemed to have the day off.<br />\nAll of Margraffs pass patterns<br />\nwere either short drop offs to his<br />\n<br />\nrunning backs or short down and<br />\nouts. There were no post patterns in the Blue Jay playbook<br />\nfor Saturday.<br />\nThere was no 97-yard pass<br />\nfrom Margraff to Stromberg as<br />\nthere was against Georgetown in<br />\n1979. Nor were there 26 pass<br />\ncompletions (49 attempts) as<br />\nthere were against a different<br />\nWestern Maryland squad in<br />\n1978. Nor were there 328<br />\npassing yards as there were<br />\nagainst Moravian in 1978. All of<br />\nthese are records established by<br />\na healthy Joe Margraff, who also<br />\nholds most of the other Hopkins<br />\npassing records: most pass completions in a season (152), most<br />\npass completions in a career<br />\n(526), most passing yardage in a<br />\nseason (1,836), etc.<br />\nWhile Stromberg holds all of<br />\nHopkins' receiving records and<br />\nMargraff holds nearly every<br />\npassing record, the two seniors<br />\nhave only one sport in common,<br />\nfootball. Margraff did play baseball during his freshman year,<br />\nplaying centerfield and serving as<br />\nrelief pitcher, but the football<br />\ncoach didn't want to take the<br />\nchance on Margraff hurting his<br />\nthrowing arm.<br />\nMeanwhile, Stromberg went<br />\non to stardom in both sports,<br />\nand Margraff had to settle for<br />\nonly fall Saturday recognition.<br />\nAnd now that the winter<br />\nwill soon be upon us, what will<br />\nStromberg and Margraff do for<br />\nfun? Stromberg will do the<br />\nusual: get up at seven o'clock<br />\nevery Saturday morning to collect garbage around campus and<br />\nget in shape for the baseball<br />\nseason.<br />\nAnd what about Margraff?<br />\nThe lacrosse season is only a few<br />\nmonths away.<br />\n<br />\nJay Grapplers Look To Improve<br />\nUpon Last Season's 5-7 Record<br />\nBY MIKE VOGELBAUM<br />\nWith a longer schedule and a<br />\nlarger squad than last year, this<br />\nyear's wrestling team, coached<br />\nby former assistant coach John<br />\nKohler, has set high goals for<br />\nitself.<br />\nThe team has expanded its<br />\nschedule to 17 matches from 12<br />\nlast year. The schedule will<br />\ninclude several Division I opponents.<br />\nThis year, three seniors, two<br />\njuniors, four sophomores, and<br />\nthree freshmen will take to the<br />\nmats for Hopkins. Last year's<br />\nteam, which went 5-7, was<br />\nsomewhat smaller. \"The key ]to<br />\nthis season] is not to forfeit<br />\nmatches,\" Kohler said. \"Hopefully we can fill all weights.\"<br />\nThe lightweights will be<br />\nboosted as two of last year's<br />\nvoids will be filled by Eddie<br />\nBrown, at 118, and John<br />\nMandler, at 134. Kohler has<br />\nbeen impressed with Brown so<br />\nfar. \"He's got some good stuff<br />\nand he'll help us a lot,\" the<br />\ncoach commented. Brown, however, is out with an illness and<br />\nmay not return until after<br />\n<br />\nChristmas. Ned Berg will compete at 126 pounds.<br />\nReturning to the team after<br />\nmissing a year will be Kyle<br />\nHicks, at 142. Hicks, a senior,<br />\nplaced in tournaments two years<br />\nago. Lee Wagstaff and Todd<br />\nBaker, when he recovers from an<br />\ninjury, will also wrestle at 142.<br />\nJoel Eichler will compete at<br />\n150. Eichler, a sophomore, was<br />\ncalled \"last year's most consistent freshman\" by Kohler.<br />\nAt 158 will be John<br />\nMastrangello, and at 167 will be<br />\nGreg Haladyna. The coach remarked that the increase in<br />\nHaladyna's strength from last<br />\nyear is \"incredible.\" Haladyna<br />\nwon about 3/4 of his matches<br />\nlast year.<br />\nAs for the heavyweights,<br />\nRich Grohol will wrestle at 177,<br />\nFran Mullen, at 177 or 190, and<br />\nHaswell Franklin at 190 or<br />\nunlimited. Franklin and Mullen<br />\nplayed football, so they are not<br />\nin shape to wrestle yet, according to Kohler. The newcomers to<br />\nthe team, Jeff Greenspan, at<br />\n190, and Richard Chang, heavyweight, are \"coming along pretty<br />\nwell,\" said Kohler.<br />\n<br />\nThe major problem with the<br />\nteam is a lack of depth. \"Wrestling is probably the most demanding sport there is, and it<br />\ntakes its toll,\" said Kohler. The<br />\ncoach feels that many students<br />\nwho have wrestled before will<br />\nnot go out, because they are<br />\nafraid to do things that can hurt<br />\nthem, such as lose weight.<br />\nKohler added, \"We're a<br />\nvarsity sport in very heavy<br />\nacademic environment.- The<br />\nteam does not give scholarships;<br />\nthe team members participate<br />\nbecause they want to wrestle.\"I<br />\nkeep things in their proper<br />\nperspective and start from<br />\nthere,\" explained Kohler.<br />\nAs for this year's prospects,<br />\nKohler feels he has \"a better<br />\nteam than last year.\" He thinks<br />\nthe team can achieve a winning<br />\nseason. Kohler added, though,<br />\n\"Wrestling is an individual sport.<br />\nYou have to look and see how<br />\neach wrestler improved from last<br />\nyear.\" The coach feels that one<br />\nor two wrestlers will be able to<br />\nplace in the tournaments. Last<br />\nyear, none did.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 22 / NOVEMBER 20, 1981<br />\n\u2022,\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTAKE IT<br />\nEASY!<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTOO BUSY TO GET IT TYPED ?<br />\n<br />\nTyping<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\nServices<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\nlt4<br />\n<br />\nRESUMES<br />\n235-3500<br />\n<br />\n1c4<br />\n1c4<br />\n<br />\nNicholsonne & Associates<br />\n2958 Greenmount Avenue<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022s\u2022sms\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n131<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022II al \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAilarrie<br />\n<br />\nIMMIGRATION<br />\nPROBLEMS<br />\n<br />\nleIV Ile oili\u2022IV\"VWIC'RV 11`<br />\n<br />\n10011111114<br />\n<br />\nii4<br />\n<br />\nICINPAI<br />\nac.16.4(.41641.4164116416.11\u2022ACeilgoallirialovilovairibleillgeModereiCovitoll<br />\n<br />\n111<br />\n<br />\nTERM PAPERS\u2014REPORTS<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nrelleIV\"le<br />\n<br />\n$21<br />\nt4<br />\n1c4<br />\n<br />\nFRIDAY AND SATURDAY<br />\nMIDNIGHT<br />\nTHE TOWSON THEATRE PRESENTS<br />\nThe second in a series of Midnight shows.<br />\n<br />\nERASERHEAD<br />\nFRIDAY AND SATURDAY NOVEMBER 20 P! 21<br />\n<br />\nk_J<br />\nVrofelVoll.<br />\n41111<br />\ngeit`it`on<br />\n, IPV1114 WWII%is'isr<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1141114111,411\u2022\u2022\u2022\u20221\u20221\u202211\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022at,\u202216\u202241.Mr<br />\naldniliragoair alkallird<br />\n11011011011011011\u202211011011\u202211011\u202211011011011011011111110ii\u2022Iieli\u2022H\u20221111111\u2022111111101111111011011<br />\n<br />\nTO SUDS,<br />\n<br />\nCall 332-4150<br />\n<br />\nHEALTHY MALES 19-35<br />\n<br />\nWITH LOVE,<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Li S visa petitions and appeals\u2022Lab\u00b0,certifications<br />\n\u2022Defense against Cleporlatinn \u2022 Roative petanr,\u2022U S Otizenshq<br />\n<br />\nMay be eligible to<br />\nearn $100-$500 NOW!<br />\nP-K Laboratories asks you to join our<br />\nprogram as a participant in physician's<br />\nsupervised studies<br />\n<br />\nSHEENA<br />\n<br />\nLaw Offices:<br />\n<br />\nGordon & Heneson.

According to Section la of the<br />\nproposed Human Life Statute,<br />\nsponsored by Senator Jesse<br />\nHelms (R-NC), \"The Congress<br />\nfinds that the life of each human<br />\nbeing begins at conception.\"<br />\nWhere the Congress could find<br />\nthis is beyond the scope of<br />\nrealistic thinking, for no scientific or medical evidence has been<br />\n(and probably ever will be) able<br />\nto prove when life begins. Yet<br />\nmany conservative members of<br />\nCongress have used this \"fact\" as<br />\nthe basis for three proposed<br />\nconstitutional amendments and<br />\none proposed statute restricting<br /><br />\nor prohibiting., abortion. If,<br />\nwithin the next four weeks,<br />\nthese proposals are not brought<br />\nto a vote, they certainly will be<br />\nwhen Congress reconvenes in<br />\nJanuary. The decision will affect<br />\nthe life of every woman in the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nIn the mid-1800s, several<br />\nstates outlawed abortion. Such<br />\nlegislation was passed not to<br />\nprotect the rights of the unborn,<br />\nbut to safeguard the pregnant<br />\nwoman from the unsound medical procedures used in performing abortions. The decision in<br />\n1973 to leave the choice of<br />\nabortion up to a woman and her<br />\nphysician (Roe v. Wade) was<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nThe GRO compliments the<br />\nNews-Letter on the attention it<br />\nhas given to security problems at<br />\nHopkins. As your recent survey<br />\nform shows, however, a focus on<br />\nsecurity personnel instead of<br />\nmore general areas of concern<br />\nleaves many questions unanswered.<br />\nWe would like to suggest<br />\nsome additional issues for your<br />\nconsideration. Your survey can<br />\nbe answered only by students<br />\nwho have encountered security<br />\nofficers regarding a specific<br />\ncomplaint. Many security problems, such as poor lighting on<br />\ncampus or inadequate locks in<br />\nUniversity apartments are not<br />\nissues a student calls campus<br />\nsecurity to resolve.<br />\nFor example, the Graduate<br />\nWomen's Committee surveyed<br />\ngraduate women last spring and<br />\nfound that 84% of the respondents did not feel safe on campus<br />\nat night, and 74% said traveling<br />\nto and from campus at night was<br />\na problem. These concerns<br />\nwould not show up on your<br />\nsurvey.<br />\nWe encourage you to supplement the survey you took<br />\nand address these larger, serious<br />\nconcerns that deserve the full<br />\nattention of the Hopkins community.<br />\nKathy Ogren<br /><br />\nunwittingly did me a huge favor<br />\nby removing the two rear wheels<br />\nand tires from my car last<br />\nSaturday night.

You didn't know that the<br />\nair compressor had broken recently ($325 repair cost), that<br />\nthe front transmission seals<br />\nwere leaking ($250), or that the<br />\ntiming drain needed to be<br />\nreplaced ($200). You also didn't<br />\nknow that for these reasons, I<br />\nwas probably going to junk<br />\nmy car after this semester<br />\nanyway. In fact, my biggest<br />\ntrauma for the last few weeks<br />\nhas been that my car might<br />\nbreak down in the middle of<br />\nNew Jersey while driving up to<br />\nNew York for Thanksgiving or<br />\nChristmas. But, thanks to your<br />\nindustrious efforts, I no longer<br />\nhave to worry about this possibility or the costly repairs.

One department, however, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BG&amp;E) is asking for its<br />\nlargest rate hike in 165 years. If<br />\nthe company is successful, and<br />\nthe Maryland Public Service<br />\nCommission grants BG&amp;E the<br />\nthe unborn.\" A constitutional $199 million it is requesting, the<br />\namendment, not a statute, is average consumer's bill will<br />\nnecessary to reverse this deci- increase by 12 dollars a month.<br />\nFor the wealthy, a higher<br />\nsion.<br />\nthe energy bill may, at the most,<br />\nof<br />\nintent<br />\nThe<br />\nLife elicit a disgruntled moan about<br />\nGarn/Oberstar Human<br />\nAmendment is the same as the the continuing inflation.

In fact, in just one<br />\nyear after abortion became legal<br />\nin 1973, the mortality rate from<br />\nthis operation dropped 40 percent.<br />\nThis decision was also based<br />\non the \"right of privacy.\". In the<br />\ncase of Eisenstadt v. Baird<br />\n(extending the sale and use of<br />\ncontraceptives to unmarried persons), the Court said, \"If the<br />\nright of privacy means anything,<br />\nit is the right of the individual,<br />\nmarried or singly, to be free<br />\nfrom unwarranted governmental<br />\nintrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as<br />\nthe decision whether to bear or<br />\nbeget a child.\" In 1973, the<br />\nCourt extended its definition,<br />\nsaying, \"This right of privacy...is<br />\nbroad enough to encompass a<br />\nwoman's decision whether or<br />\nnot to terminate her pregnancy.\"<br />\nThe four bills now before<br />\nCongress -- the Human Life<br />\nAmendment<br />\nFederalism<br />\n(HLFA), sponsored by Senator<br />\nOrrin Hatch (R-Utah); the Human Life Statute (HLS), sponsored by Senator Helms; the<br />\nHuman Life Amendment(HLA),<br />\nsponsored by Representative<br />\nOberstar (D-Minn) and Representative Jake Garn (R-Utah);<br />\nand the Paramount \"Right to<br />\nLife\" Amendment (RLA), sponRepresentatives<br />\nby<br />\nsored<br />\nDorman (D-Calif), Gaydos (RPenn), and Paul (R-Texas), and<br />\nSenator Helms \u2014 all attempt to<br />\noverrule the Roe v. Wade decision, thereby rescinding the<br />\nwoman's right to privacy and her<br />\nprivilege to obtain a safe, legal<br />\nabortion.<br />\nThe HLFA gives the right to<br />\nrestrict and prohibit abortion to<br />\nboth Congress and the states<br />\n(with the more restrictive state<br />\nlaws governing). The stringency<br />\nof the law would vary from<br />\nCongress to Congress, thereby<br />\nforcing women to seek out<br />\n\"back-alley\" abortions during<br />\nthe times of a more conservative<br />\nCongress.<br /><br />\nOne seriously wonders if<br />\nJesse Helms' Human Life Statute<br />\nwas intended more for promoting his political career than for<br />\nserious legislative action. Aside<br />\nfrom Congress' great discovery<br />\nthat the life of each human<br />\nbeing begins at conception and<br />\nthat this \"human being\" is<br />\nprotected by the Fourteenth<br />\nAmendment of the Constitution,<br />\nthe Helms bill also provides that<br />\nall appeals must go to the<br />\nSupreme Court, which \"shall<br />\nadvance on its docket and<br />\nexpedite the disposition of any<br />\nsuch appeal.\" It would be<br />\nvirtually impossible for the<br />\nCourt to hear all such cases and<br />\nto act so expeditiously that it<br />\nwould still be possible for the<br />\nwoman to obtain a safe abortion, if the Court so decided. In<br />\nRoe v. Wade, the Supreme Court<br />\nstated that \"the word 'person,'<br />\nas used in the Fourteenth<br />\nAmendment, does not include<br /><br />\nThe Loop In \"The Entertainer\"<br />\nCOC41<br /><br />\n(77-10E's A NEAT arc!!<br />\nottfi AT\" TYE<br />\n10!iLEv4RO,AN.9<br /><br />\nTS<br />\n17-115 GEATH10E?<br />\nLooP !JERE<br /><br />\nMYSELF DOwN AND Do<br />\nSOME WORK!<br /><br />\nFox ToO,LONG<br />\n8EEN<br />\nLET7-ING THE TINIEST DISTmc<br />\nTONS KEEPHE FROM MY<br />\nSTUD IES/<br />\nAc Tu/91_ y<br />\n13EE\"-fLOOKIJc FOR<br />\nEXCUSES NOT TO WORK!<br /><br />\nrate hike is necessary. Its reason<br />\nhowever, is not claimed to be the<br />\nrising cost of fuel. As the<br />\ncompany explains in its rate hike<br />\napplication, it is because BG&amp;E<br />\nwants to pay more money to its<br />\ninvestors, at the expense of<br />\nconsumers. To be sure, BG&amp;E<br />\ndoes deserve some increase.<br />\nInflation has taken its toll on<br />\nBG&amp;E and it does need some<br />\nmoney to raise their rate to<br />\nreturn on investment to 9.55%, a<br />\nrate that was previously granted<br />\nby the Public Service Commission. Yet most of the increase<br />\nwill go toward raising the<br />\nutility's rate of return from 9.55<br />\npercent to 11.5 percent.<br />\nIftwe don't raise our rate of<br />\nreturn to 11.5 percent, claims<br />\nBG&amp;E, our investors will start<br />\nputting their money into money<br />\nmarkets and other stocks.

Edward Bentley has handpicked and carefully arranged them into<br />\nsomething resembling a play.<br />\nAYNOHYEB begins with Sam<br />\nWood (director of Goodbye, Mr. Chips)<br />\ntelling the committee that the actors',<br />\ndirectors', and screenwriters' unions are<br />\nbeing run by communists. For the rest of<br />\nthe play various celebrities are hauled up<br />\nbefore the committee and questioned by<br />\nthe Inquisitors General. We slowly learn<br />\nthat sure enough there are some commies<br />\nin Show Biz, though they may not really<br />\nbe controlling the unions. In fact, anybody who's anybody went to a few party_<br />\nmeetings.<br />\nIn the first act, actors who used to&lt;<br />\nbe party members in the early '40s are<br />\nbrought before the committee. Larry<br />\nParks, an All-American grass roots actor,<br />\nis a prime example. He feels guilty about<br /><br />\nhis party affiliation in the past, and has<br />\nsince repented his sins. The moral question for him is whether or not he should<br />\nrat on his colleagues who were similarly<br />\nled down Un-American paths. He fears he<br />\nwill ruin their careers (as his was ruined)<br />\nif he makes their names public.<br />\nAs the play progresses, those<br />\nbeing investigated become less and less<br />\nguilty about their own activities, and<br />\nmore suspicious of the committee's. Abe<br />\nBurrows, the author of Guys and Dolls,<br />\nbegins to undermine the committee's<br />\nprying with his intelligent honesty and<br />\nsharp wit. He is the first to admit that he<br />\ncould have been called a communist.<br />\nLionel Stander then dramatically shifts<br /><br />\nthe argument, claiming that the communists' activities were constitutionally justifiable, whereas the actions of the committee are not. In the final scene, with Paul<br />\nRobeson, the black singer-performer, the<br />\nargument completes its shift. Not only<br />\ndoes Robeson admit his sympathies with<br />\nthe communists (mostly due to their<br />\nacceptance of blacks as equals), he<br /><br />\nLarry Parks (left), played by Josh Shoemaker, consults his lawyer.<br /><br />\nJHU Orchestra Premieres AtShriver<br />\nBY BRUCE ALPERT<br />\nThe Hopkins Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Catherine<br />\nOverhauser, opened its first season last<br />\nSunday with a solid, and often exciting,<br />\nprogram of classical music.<br />\nPerforming in Shriver Hall to an<br />\naudience that filled the auditorium to<br />\napproximately three quarters of capacity,<br />\nthe orchestra treated its listeners to pieces<br />\nby Schubert, Beethoven, Ravel and<br />\nRimsky-Korsakov.. Its performance of each<br />\nwas admirable, winning the well-deserved<br />\naccolades of its audience.<br />\nThis first concert of the orchestra's first season began shortly after 3<br />\np.m. After a short welcoming speech by<br />\norchestra president Stephen Miller, concert master Mario Diaz tuned his orchestra for its first number, Franz Schubert's<br />\nOverture to \"Rosamunde,\" the accompaniment to Helmine von Chezy's 1823<br />\nplay. It was at this point that the concert's first, and only, minor mishap took<br />\nplace. For about three minutes both the<br />\norchestra and the audience sat in silence<br />\nas a backstage search for the conductor's<br />\nmusic took place. Presently, however,<br />\nOverhauser mounted her podium and<br />\ndirected her musicians into their first<br />\nperformance. One, or possibly two, of the<br />\nviolins were slightly off key, thus diminishing, ever-so-modestly, the beauty of<br />\nthe strings. Nonetheless, the rest of the<br />\norchestra performed extremely well,<br />\nfrequently rising to dramatic pinnacles. In<br />\nall, the opening piece was finely done,<br />\nsetting a favorable tone for the remainder<br />\nof the concert.<br />\nThe next piece was Ludwig van<br />\nBeethoven's Piano Concerto Number 3 in<br />\nC minor Opus 37. Thanks to the efforts<br />\nof pianist Annie D'Arco, the concerto<br />\nsoon turned out to be one of the concert's two high points. D'Arco, a graduate<br />\nof the Paris Conservatory of Music and<br />\nmember of the faculty of \"L'Ecole<br />\nNormale de Musique de Paris,\" gave a<br />\nspirited performance as she manipulated<br /><br />\nthe keyboard with visual as well as aural<br />\nelegance. As she performed each of the<br />\nconcerto's three movements with style<br />\nand feeling, the audience watched and<br />\nlistened with excitement, seizing the<br />\nbreaks between the movements to show<br />\ntheir appreciation with applause.<br />\nAfter the completion of the<br />\nconcerto, the audience called D'Arco<br />\nback to the stage twice before she mollified them with her encore, Gabriel<br />\nPierne's \"Concerto Study Opus 13.\" This<br />\nshe performed with the same vivacity that<br />\nwith the same vivacity tile marked her<br />\nperformance of Beethoven. When she<br />\nfinished, the audience again thundered its<br />\napproval, calling her three more times to<br />\nthe stage before the applause subsided.<br />\nReturning from intermission, the<br />\norchestra gave a fine performance of<br />\nMaurice Ravel's \"Pavane pour une Infante<br />\nDefunte\" (Pavane for a Dead Princess).<br />\nWhile the execution of the orchestra was<br />\nperhaps at its peak with this piece, it,<br />\nunfortunately, fell upon an audience still<br />\ngreen with the memory of the preceding<br />\nconcerto. And, as it turned out, what<br />\nimpressions were formed of the Pavane<br />\nwould be dealt a further blow by the<br />\npiece that would follow it.<br />\nThe last number of the concert,<br />\nand the performance's second high point,<br />\nwas Nicolai Rimslcy-Korsakov's \"Capriccio Espanol, Opus 34,\" a piece RimskyKorsakov himself called \"a brilliant<br />\ncomposition for the orchestra.\" While<br />\norchestra president Stephen Miller privately concedes that \"parts of the<br />\nRimsky-Korsakov came off rather sloppy,\" little, if any, of this was noticeable to<br />\nthe audience in general. In fact, this final<br />\npiece seemed an exciting work of orchestration through which the symphony<br />\ndemonstrated its dramatic prowess.<br />\nMinor flaws detracted somewhat<br />\nfrom the concert. Unfortunately, the<br />\ngrand piano was placed directly in front<br />\nof the conductor and, when opened,<br />\ncompletely obstructed the audience's<br />\nview of the orchestra. Given the limita-<br /><br />\ntions of the Shriver stage, however, it<br />\nappears that little could have been done<br />\nto prevent this. The second flaw was<br />\nquite avoidable. There was no consistency<br />\nin dress among the members of the<br />\norchestra. It was very disconcerting to see<br />\nthat each musician had his own style and<br />\ncolor clothing. While this did not diminish the fine performance, it did give the<br />\norchestra a rag-tag appearance that<br />\nbetrdyed its otherwise professional demeanor.<br />\ncont. on p. 15<br /><br />\naccuses the committee of being NeoFascist.<br />\nThe fact that the play was based<br />\nstrictly on actual transcripts makes the<br />\nplay historically fascinating but dramaturgically uninteresting. The first act<br />\nfloods the audience with a myriad of<br />\nnames and faces, many of which will be<br />\nunfamiliar to the viewer. Some witnesses<br />\nwere not acted out, but their words were<br />\nmerely taped, which left the actors on<br />\nstage with nothing to do. The painful and<br />\nmonotous questioning of countless witnesses grows very tiresome. The courtroom setting is claustrophobic and the<br />\naction is confined to armchairs. Though<br />\nthere is no rising action (only a compiling<br />\nof data), the witnesses do get progressively more interesting and animated. The<br />\nfirst act is very long and the acting is not<br />\ngood enough to plug the holes of a<br />\nsinking ship.<br />\nThe second act, however, begins<br />\nwith the witty dialogue and lively acting<br />\nof Abe Burrows(Ken Hayward). By now,<br />\nthose of the audience whose minds didn't<br />\nstray or doze off in act one have compiled enough facts to understand elements of the truth behind communist<br />\nactivities in the entertainment industry.<br />\nRalph Piersanti delivered a strong performance of Lionel Stander, and the play<br />\nends with a fine portrayal of Paul<br />\nRobeson by Edward Heath. The pathos<br />\nevoked by Robeson in his brilliant<br />\nspeeches and his courageous evocation of<br />\nthe Fifth Amendment is the antithesis of<br />\nthe lifeless first act.<br />\nThe play clearly made one feel<br />\nlike communists aren't so bad; in fact,<br />\nmany of our favorite actors were reds.<br />\nFor this reason, and the reason that the<br />\nplay as a historical document is educational, Are You Now Or Have You Ever<br />\nBeen is worth seeing.

Those of you<br />\nwho saw Debbie may draw your own<br />\nconclusions; personally, I feel there is<br />\nonly so many times you can watch<br />\nsomeone go down on someone else before<br />\nyou get a bit bored. But Debbie has come<br />\nand gone amidst a weekend of threatened<br />\nraids and broken film.

Kichi is an older man with one hell<br />\nof a body who blatantly initiates the<br />\nrelationship with her.<br />\nSada's past as a whore has been<br />\nalluded to earlier, so (remembering the<br />\nunenlightened views of the early-century<br />\nJapanese toward sex) it does not seem<br />\nincongruous that she so readily accepts<br />\nhim. The real reason, however, is shortly<br /><br />\napparent: Sada is one horny lady.<br />\nAlthough equally intense to a<br />\npoint, Kichi, it must be remembered,is a<br />\nman and has the propensity to come but<br />\nonce. Sada, however, forgets this. The<br />\ntwo neither eat nor drink for days: sex is<br />\ntheir nourishment, and while Kichi does<br />\nallow himself to sleep, Sada most often<br />\ndoes not. We can often find her performing fellatio on the sleeping Kichi or<br />\nstaring at him adoringly.<br />\nTheir common \u2022 one-track mind<br />\nincreasingly isolates them from society.<br />\nAs women (other geishas) begin to look<br />\ndown upon Sada, she and Kichi become<br />\nmore flagrant about their lovemaking,<br />\nstartling the very people who criticize<br />\ntheir actions even more when,in mid-conversation, one of them will throw up the<br />\nkimono of the other and begin another<br />\ngrueling sex marathon regardless of who<br />\nis watching.<br />\nIt gets to the point, though, where<br />\nthey can do only so much of one thing<br />\nbefore they become bored and variation<br />\nis necessary (think back on Debbie).<br />\nNeither Kichi nor Sada is adverse to<br />\nfinding the ultimate pleasure.

I said<br />\ngood-bye to Sarah-Jane and felt relieved to be<br />\ngetting out,<br />\nNow I tried to prepare myself for a<br />\nUniversity homecoming. I remembered why I<br />\nalmost hadn't gone away for the weekend. There<br />\nis something to be said for keeping in motion at<br />\nall times. Once I've established my home and<br />\nlifestyle, breaking the routine destroys momenturn. I begin to doubt. My separation anxiety is<br />\ncaused by imagining how it will feel to be back<br />\nin classes and in my apartment. I recalled my<br />\npre-departure procedures before leaving Baltimore. I had organized my books and packed and<br />\nrepacked my clothes three times. I thought<br />\nabout saying good-byes. Usually I avoid goodbyes. I say, \"I'll probably see you before I go.\"<br />\nBut I never even attempt to say good-bye.<br />\nSometimes I wonder what would happen if I<br /><br />\nwere to have a train crash or were kidnapped<br />\nand never saw my friends again. Good-byes are<br />\nsad, and make me lose momentum even faster. I<br />\ntried a good-bye on my friend Dinah's cat, Pang,<br />\nwho was staying at my apartment over the<br />\nweekend because Dinah's sister, who was visiting, was allergic to cats.<br />\n\"I'll probably see you before I leave. I<br />\nwon't say good-bye now.\" I said it in a casual<br />\ntone of voice, trying to be unemotional. Pang,<br />\nwho doesn't suffer from separation anxiety,<br />\nlooked at me indifferently. \"If anything happens<br />\nto me,\" I added, \"this apartment is yours.\" I<br />\nyelled good-bye to him again just as I left, but<br />\nhe stayed at the window, crouched by the<br />\ncurtain.<br />\nThat might be a way to eliminate separation anxiety: if I got a cat, I reasoned, I<br />\nwouldn't come home to an empty apartment. I<br />\nwould learn to say good-bye without feeling<br />\nanguish, and the fear of coming home and losing<br />\nmomentum and forgetting why I was in college<br />\nwouldn't be as bad if I knew someone like Pang<br />\nwas waiting for me, depending on me for survivat. Dinah's relationship with Pang definitely<br />\nmade me consider sharing my apartment with a<br />\ncat. Pang proved too restless for my pace, and<br />\nafter Dinah told of how Pang had swallowed two<br />\npennies and needed an operation which cost<br />\nmore than a hundred dollars, I decided I would<br /><br />\nstay single. Why, I wondered, did he swallow<br />\ntwo pennies? Did he eat one with gusto as an<br />\nappetizer, and a second as dessert? Did he<br />\nswallow them whole, like sleeping pills when he<br />\nwas in a suicidal mood? Before I left the apartment I hid all my pennies (just in case) and all<br />\nmy socks. Pang likes to masturbate with socks.<br />\nThat was days \u2014 seemingly weeks \u2014 ago,<br />\nand now it was Monday, and I was about to<br />\nenter academia again. The bus stopped behind<br />\nShriver. I got out, and walked towards my<br />\napartment. A question annoyed me as I climbed<br />\nthe stairs. Why do apartment buildings always<br />\nsmell of Raid and cooked broccoli? It's a lethal<br />\ncombination which is sometimes joined by<br />\nbacon smoke or carpet lint. Coming home, in<br />\nmy mind, will always be linked with the eternal<br />\nsmell of broccoli in hallways. Maybe all vegetables, when boiled properly, smell like broccoli.<br />\nMaybe at the end of the world, the wind will<br />\nblow the scent of Raid and cooked broccoli<br />\nbefore the lights go out and C&amp;P Telephone cuts<br />\noff service.<br />\nI unlocked my apartment and dropped<br />\nmy pack on the bed. Pang, crouched by the ,<br />\nwindow in the same pose as when I'd left him,<br />\nlooked at me and opened his mouth, releasing a<br />\nsilent but somehow tragic cry. Then I saw it. On<br />\nthe floor by the desk, curled like a limp sidewalk<br />\nworm, lay a lone blue wool sock.<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 / NOVEMBER 20, 1981<br /><br />\n\"Ilie Johns I lopkins University Office of Special Events presents<br /><br />\n'THE WINTER SOI\u201eSTK:E<br />\n\\MOLE EAZ\"Jai CI IRIS'!'\\1AS CELEBRAFION<br /><br />\nRATHSKELLAR<br />\nLevering Hall<br />\nHOT BUFFET<br />\nEvery Tuesday and Wednesday<br />\n11:30 2:00<br />\nIMPORTED BEERS NOW AVAILABLE<br />\nMolson<br />\nErlanger<br />\nTuborg-Light and Dark<br />\nLowenbrau Dark<br />\nHappy Hour<br />\nEvery Friday<br /><br />\nLadies Night<br />\nEvery Saturday<br /><br />\n4:30-8:30 P.M.<br />\n2 for 1 on ALL<br />\nDraft-Wine-Soda<br />\nIn Cups<br /><br />\nAll Beer-Wine-Soda<br />\nPitcher and Cup<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n2 Price<br />\nMonday Night<br />\nFootball<br />\nOpen 'Til Game is Over<br />\nAll Draft Beer - 65 cents<br />\nAll Pitchers of Beer - $2.75<br /><br />\nA Spectacular Concert in a Spectacular Cathedral Setting by<br /><br />\nNew Hours - Monday - Friday<br />\n4:30 - 8:00 P.M.<br /><br />\nCONSORT<br />\nWINTER<br />\nTHEPAUL\u2018Vith<br />\nVocalist Susan Osborn<br />\nR I DAY.

A fitting occasion, for it<br />\nwas indeed a \"game of the<br />\ncentury\" \u2014 a nerve-wracking<br />\ncontest from start to finish with<br />\none of the freakiest endings<br />\nin Hopkins' or anyone else's<br />\nhistory. Final score: Johns Hopkins 20, Western Maryland 14 \u2014<br />\nthe Jays' first win in this longtime rivalry (dating back to<br />\n1894) since 1975.<br />\nFor Joe Nador and the<br />\nreturnees from 1980's 1-8 team,<br />\nthe moral of the story was:<br />\nthere's always a chance for<br />\nredemption. While it had been a<br />\nlong, tough year for Nador, the<br />\nBlue Jays' placekicker, after<br />\nthis game was over an embarrassed Nador received a bear hug<br />\nfrom Hopkins athletic director<br />\nBob Scott, who called him \"the<br />\nman who pounced on it.\"<br />\nWhat Nador pounced on<br />\noccurred with just over a minute<br />\nremaining \u2014 certainly a play for<br />\nthe annals. With the score<br />\ndeadlocked at 14, Nador was<br />\ncalled upon to try a 31-yard<br />\nfield goal that would put the<br />\nJays in front. But Pat Luce, the<br />\nGreen Terrors' defensive star of<br />\nthe day, charged through and<br />\ngot a hand on the kick. Tom<br />\nKnieriem picked it up for the<br />\nTerrors and swept right; facing a<br />\nwall of tacklers, he brashly tried<br />\nto lateral it on the run to teammate Rick Conner, but he<br />\nmissed and Nador, alertly pursuing, covered the ball on the<br />\nWestern Maryland one-yard line.<br />\n\"Nador caught some criticism for not getting the field<br />\ngoals,\" said coach Jerry Pfeifer.<br />\n\"But on two of his kickoffs he<br />\nmade long-gain-saving, maybe<br />\ntouchdown-saving, tackles. He<br />\nmade three great plays and it<br />\nwas only through effort that he<br />\nmade them. I thought Joe really<br />\nnailed the ball, and I thought it<br />\nwas going to be a good field<br />\ngoal. We made a mistake in our<br />\nblocking. My reaction (to the<br />\nscore) was of it being God-sent,<br />\nbecause I didn't have anything<br />\nto do with it.- Two plays later,<br />\nthe crowd ot about 3000 erupted a second time when Jim<br />\nMargraff carried the ball over the<br />\ngoal line for the decisive, .stunning score.<br />\nMemorable as that series of<br />\nevents was, the one that occurred with 8:48 remaining in<br />\nthe third quarter may be<br />\nlonger,<br />\neven<br />\nremembered<br />\ncertainly by the NCAA. Margraff<br />\nfaded back and floated a high<br />\npass 20 yards downfield toward<br />\nthe right sideline, where Bill<br />\nStromberg outjumped the coverage and pulled it down just<br />\ninbounds. The catch was the<br />\n254th of Stromberg's Hopkins<br />\ncareer, breaking Chris Myers'<br />\nDivision III career receiving<br />\nrecord with less than 30 minutes<br />\nremaining in Stromberg's time as<br />\na Blue Jay football player.<br />\nThe game was stopped as<br />\nrealization came, and<br />\nthe<br />\nStromberg was presented with<br />\nthe historic ball and received<br />\ncongratulations from his teammates.<br />\nStromberg played his last<br /><br />\nHopkins game in typical Stromberg style. He didn't see too Much<br />\ndouble coverage, but the coverage he had \u2014 primarily Luce or<br />\nKnieriem \u2014 stayed with Stromberg virtually step for step most<br />\nof the time. Not quite close<br /><br />\nreceivers open and feeling a<br />\nstrong pass rush from Wayne<br />\nKeen and George Probeyhan,<br />\nMargraff made repeated errant<br />\npasses early on and finished the<br />\nfirst half with only eight completions in 22 attempts.<br /><br />\nback Jim Johnson and forced a<br />\nfumble that Dan Burns pounced<br />\non to give the Jays the ball at<br />\nthe Terror 33. Two 13-yard<br />\ncompletions, the first to Stromberg and the second to Doug<br />\nMay, and a pass interference call<br /><br />\n25 yards to the Hopkins 15<br />\nbefore being brought down.<br />\nThen, facing third and 11,<br />\nSelfridge bootlegged around<br />\nright end down to the one, from<br />\nwhere he scored the first of his<br />\ntwo touchdowns.<br />\nThe Jays used almost seven<br />\nminutes to retake the lead after<br />\nhalftime. A suddenly revitalized<br />\nrunning game allowed Hopkins<br />\nto drive to the Terror 37, from<br />\nwhere Margraff unloaded to<br />\nStromberg for ; the record-setting catch. After three incomplete passes, the Jays went for it<br />\non fourth down;Stromberg beat<br />\nthe coverage, took another high<br />\nlob, and ran in untouched.<br />\nThe lead didn't last very<br />\nlong, as the Terrors tied the<br />\nscore at 14 on their next possession after Conner returned the<br />\nkickoff to midfield. Selfridge hit<br />\nreceiver/kicker Rich Johnson<br />\nthree times, good for 38 yards \u2014<br />\nthe last a difficult sideline catch<br />\nat the Hopkins nine. From the<br />\none<br />\nSelfridge ran it in<br />\nuntouched.<br /><br />\nConner quickly gave the<br />\nThe Blue Jays celebrate after completing a 7-2 season.<br />\nTerrors another opportunity by<br />\nAgain, the Jay defense rose in the end zone set up Bot intercepting a Margraff pass and<br />\nenough, however. Stromberg<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\noccasion in the first half. Sternfeld's seventh touchdowr returning it to the Hopkins 30.<br />\nto<br />\nseemingly always managed<br />\nDon<br />\nFielder picked up 26 of the year, a one-yard plunge. On the next play, Selfridge had<br />\nAfter<br />\ndown<br />\ncoming<br />\nfind some way of<br />\nwith any ball thrown his way;in yards in his first two carries, the Nador's kick made it 7-0. Andy Baum open near the goal<br />\nThe Terrors got one first- line, but overthrew him and Jeff<br />\none eye-opener, he was knocked Terror offens-: became equally<br />\ndown, the pass tipped \u2014 and he sluggish and felt an equally half drive going and used it to Kendall snared the pass for<br />\nstill somehow caught it while on strong pass rush.

Ursinus,<br />\nwhich made it to the Division III<br />\nsemifinals last year, won't be as<br />\nThe Jays<br />\ntough this year.<br />\nshouldn't have too much trouble<br />\nwith Haverford or Swarthmore,<br />\nbut they always have problems<br />\nwith Washington College. Washington, 3-7 in the MAC South<br />\nlast season, beat the Jays twice.<br />\nUnder new coach Nappy<br />\nDoherty, the Jays will be a little<br />\ndifferent than they were last<br />\nyear under Jim Amen. The Jays<br />\nwill go with two guards, rather<br />\nthan with a point guard. As a<br />\nresult, the Jays will run more<br />\nand employ the fast break more<br />\noften. In addition, Doherty has<br />\ngiven the green light to all his<br />\nplayers to shoot if they have an<br />\nopen shot.<br />\nThis year's Hopkins squad<br />\nappears to be improved over last<br />\nseason's 12-12 team. The Blue<br />\nJays' key asset will be experience. The team is mostly a<br />\nveteran squad, with only three<br />\nnewcomers: freshman Michael<br />\nSullivan, sophomore Michael<br />\nSnider (who played on the<br />\njunior varsity last year) and<br />\njunior Chris McShea, a transfer<br />\nfrom Holy Cross. McShea,6'3\",<br />\nwho practiced with the Jays last<br />\nyear but was red-shirted, is the<br />\nkey addition to the squad.<br />\nThe probable starting forward line for the Jays will consist of three players will provide the bulk of the scoring.<br />\nTessitore, 6'3\", is the captain of the team and a fourthyear starter. He will switch to<br />\nthe small forward position this<br />\nyear. Tessitore has been the<br />\nmost consistent Jay over the<br />\npast three years. Last year, he<br />\nwas second in scoring, averaging<br />\n10.6 points. He was also second<br />\non the team in rebounding.<br />\nNikic, 6'6\", was the Jays'<br /><br />\nJay women during practice<br /><br />\nleading scorer last season, tallying 11.5 points per game. Despite a midseason slump, Nikic<br />\nhad a career-high 31 points<br />\nagainst Haverford in the secondto-last game fo the season.<br />\nNikic is a good outside shooter<br /><br />\nthree-point play at the buzzer.<br />\nBarr averaged 5.8 points overall,<br />\nbut averaged 8.3 points in MAC<br />\ngames. However, he is suspect on<br />\ndefense.<br /><br />\npotent scoring threat, as witnessed by his 31 -point effort in<br />\nthe Blue-White intrasquad scrimmage on Tuesday.<br />\nThe guard spot has provided<br />\nlittle scoring in the past. However, starting guards Scott Barr<br /><br />\nScott Kautz, rarely shooting<br />\n'the ball last season,led the team<br />\nwith 3.5 assists per game.<br />\nHe ran the team from the point<br />\nguard position. Kautz, 5'11\",<br />\nan excellent rebounder<br />\nis<br />\nfor his size and hustles consistently, often diving after loose<br />\nballs. Look for him to shoot<br />\nmore this season.<br />\nWith coach Doherty carrying only an eleven-man squad,<br />\nthe bench should see a great deal<br />\nof action. Up front, the Jays<br />\nexpect good seasons from sophomore Robert Clayton, junior<br />\nKarl Hakmiller, senior Nelson<br />\nFile and sophomore Michael<br />\nSnider. Clayton,<br />\n6'5\" ,is an<br />\nexcellent rebounder and strong<br />\noff the offensive<br />\nboards.<br />\nHakmiller, 6' 7\", is also a good<br />\nleaper and an excellent shooter.<br />\nFile,<br />\n6'2\", and<br />\nSnider,<br />\n6'2\", are both small forwards.<br />\nFile, used sparingly last year,<br />\nmay also see some action at the<br />\n2 guard position. Snider, an excelt=t<br />\n&lt; lent outside shooter, could be<br />\nthe team's zone breaker.<br /><br />\nWall,<br />\nSophomore Glenn<br />\nSophomore Bob Clayton (right) goes for the block.<br />\nwill be the first guard<br />\nand Scott Kautz, both seniors, 5'10\",<br />\nand hits the boards well.<br />\nMcShea, despite being a are steady, consistent ballplay- off the bench. Wall is an excellent ballhandler and shooter..<br />\nnewcomer, is regarded as a lead- ers.<br />\nSullivan.<br />\nLast year, Barr had several Freshman Michael<br />\ner by his teammates. An aggrescharge<br />\nfourth<br />\nguard<br />\nthe<br />\ntaking<br />\non the<br />\ngames,<br />\nis<br />\noutstanding<br />\n6'2\",<br />\nsive player, he is very strong inside and will strengthen the Jays' in clutch situations. He beat squad. He is a quick, solid<br />\nrebounding. McShea is also a Swarthmore, 63-62, with a ballhandler and shooter.<br /><br />\nNew Players Key For Women<br />\nBY RAMAN BET-MANSOUR<br />\nWomen's basketball at Hopkins has never had anything to<br />\nboast about. It has never been a<br />\nMAC power, nor has it ever<br />\nstarted any season with high<br />\nhopes. After all, it has never had<br />\na full-time coach. Last year's<br />\n3-12 record was indicative of the<br />\nteam's performance.<br />\nBut this year things look<br />\ndifferent. For the first time<br />\nthere is a full-time coach, Kay<br />\nFowler, who has proven her<br />\neffectiveness as a coach by<br />\nleading the Hopkins women's<br />\ntennis team to the MAC championship earlier in the year.<br />\nThere are also many new,<br />\nexciting players who will make<br />\nthe team more competitive. The<br />\nteam has two very good ballhandlers in Liz Hirschhorn, a<br />\nGeraldine<br />\nand<br />\nsophomore,<br />\nKlauber, a transfer from Trinity<br />\nCollege. Both are very adept at<br />\nmaking passes, creating opportunities for teammates, and<br />\nare able to direct the flow of the<br />\ngame. Celeste DiBatiste will be<br />\ncounted on to play center, as<br />\nthe sophomore is an excellent<br />\nrebounder and can move people<br />\nout of the way.<br />\nThere are four returning<br />\nforwards, each with a different<br />\nrole on the team. Cheryl Baron,<br />\na junior, will be counted on for<br />\nrebounds. The coach is depending on Amy Buchanon to do<br /><br />\nmuch of the scoring, as she is a<br />\ngood shooter, and was one of<br />\nthe high-scorers on last year's<br />\nsquad. Kim Stevens, another<br />\njunior who was ill much of last<br />\nyear, will be trying to fill in at<br />\nthe small forward spot. Sue<br />\nTyler is the only senior on the<br />\nsquad, and she will be expected<br />\nto lead the younger and more<br />\ninexperienced players.<br />\nFowler is also depending on<br />\nthe performance and maturity of<br />\nDawn Richards, a freshman. She<br />\nwill be playing at the forward<br />\nspot, and will be a big asset to<br />\nthe rebounding and scoring.<br />\nFowler thinks she is an excellent<br />\nall-around athlete.<br />\nFowler believes she has<br />\nenough depth on her team so<br />\nthat she will not have to worry<br />\nabout injury or foul trouble. She<br />\nalso continues to believe that the<br />\nstrength of the team lies in its<br />\nshooting, a fine blend of inside<br />\nand outside shooters including<br />\nAmy Buchanon, Dawn Richards,<br />\nand Geraldine Klauber. However<br />\nshe will depend on an exciting,<br />\nfast-breaking offense for most of<br />\nthe points.<br /><br />\nbasket. Celeste DeBatiste will be<br />\nplaying center in the middle of<br />\nthe defense, with Amy Buchanon and Dawn Richards on the<br />\nwings. The 1-3-1 is an exhilarating defense, as it is based upon a<br />\nlot of pressing and playing the<br />\npassing lanes. If played correctly, with a lot of hustle, it will<br />\ncreate a great many turnovers.<br />\nThe team should also be able to<br />\nrebound very well off of it,<br />\nwhich in turn will result in a<br />\ngreat many fast-break opportunities.<br /><br />\nWhat is most different<br />\nabout this year's team from the<br />\nprevious years ia a new attitude,<br />\none of accomplishment and<br />\nself-confidence. The players are<br />\nhoping for a winning season, as<br />\nthey all believe that they will be<br />\nrespectable. Co-captain Amy<br />\nBuchanon said,\"We will definitely be a respected team, much<br />\nbetter than last year, as we will<br />\ndefeat most of our opponents.<br />\nWe will not be walkeu upon.<br />\nThere are a lot of good new<br />\nplayers, sophomores who did<br />\nnot go out last year, new freshmen, and transfers. And we are<br />\nAgainst inexperienced teams not really weak in anything.\"<br />\nwho are not able to handle the The team has been working very<br />\nball well, the team will be hard for the past three weeks, as<br />\nplaying a man-to-man defense. 18 people tried out, but only 12<br />\nHowever, the basic defense will now remain. Fowler believes<br />\nbe the 1-3-1 zone. Geraldine that her team is ready and in<br />\nKlauber will be playing up top, shape, but also that it is still<br />\nwith Liz Hirschhorn under the improving.<br /><br />\nPAGE 20!

He had ruptured<br />\nthe bursar sac in the elbow of his<br />\nright (throwing) arm during the<br />\nprevious Saturday's win over<br />\nMuhlenberg, and the resulting<br />\nfluid build-up and inflammation<br /><br />\nStromberg and Margra f a<br />\nthe season finale against Western<br />\nMaryland, Stromberg's right elbow was swelled to twice its<br />\nnormal size. And when he made<br />\nhis record-breaking reception,<br />\nStromberg appeared to have the<br />\nwind knocked out of him when<br />\nhe landed on the sideline. But<br />\nStromberg had actually fallen on<br />\nhis injured elbow and didn't get<br />\nup until his teammates came<br />\nover to congratulate him. One of<br />\nthe first to help Stromberg up<br />\nwas Jim Margraff.<br />\nMargraff, who's been throwing to Stromberg since their<br /><br />\nter record-breaking catch<br />\ncreated swelling between the<br />\nligaments and cartilage. Margraff<br />\ndidn't practice the first three<br />\ndays of the week, and Thursday<br />\nhe finally got the clearance to<br />\nplay.<br />\nAnd play he did. With a<br />\nprotective sleeve which restricted the bending of his arm,<br />\nMargraff lofted passes to his<br />\nreceivers. But the bomb was no<br />\nlonger a threat to the Western<br />\nMaryland defense, whose secondary seemed to have the day off.<br />\nAll of Margraffs pass patterns<br />\nwere either short drop offs to his<br /><br />\nrunning backs or short down and<br />\nouts. There were no post patterns in the Blue Jay playbook<br />\nfor Saturday.<br />\nThere was no 97-yard pass<br />\nfrom Margraff to Stromberg as<br />\nthere was against Georgetown in<br />\n1979. Nor were there 26 pass<br />\ncompletions (49 attempts) as<br />\nthere were against a different<br />\nWestern Maryland squad in<br />\n1978. Nor were there 328<br />\npassing yards as there were<br />\nagainst Moravian in 1978. All of<br />\nthese are records established by<br />\na healthy Joe Margraff, who also<br />\nholds most of the other Hopkins<br />\npassing records: most pass completions in a season (152), most<br />\npass completions in a career<br />\n(526), most passing yardage in a<br />\nseason (1,836), etc.<br />\nWhile Stromberg holds all of<br />\nHopkins' receiving records and<br />\nMargraff holds nearly every<br />\npassing record, the two seniors<br />\nhave only one sport in common,<br />\nfootball. Margraff did play baseball during his freshman year,<br />\nplaying centerfield and serving as<br />\nrelief pitcher, but the football<br />\ncoach didn't want to take the<br />\nchance on Margraff hurting his<br />\nthrowing arm.<br />\nMeanwhile, Stromberg went<br />\non to stardom in both sports,<br />\nand Margraff had to settle for<br />\nonly fall Saturday recognition.<br />\nAnd now that the winter<br />\nwill soon be upon us, what will<br />\nStromberg and Margraff do for<br />\nfun? Stromberg will do the<br />\nusual: get up at seven o'clock<br />\nevery Saturday morning to collect garbage around campus and<br />\nget in shape for the baseball<br />\nseason.<br />\nAnd what about Margraff?<br />\nThe lacrosse season is only a few<br />\nmonths away.<br /><br />\nJay Grapplers Look To Improve<br />\nUpon Last Season's 5-7 Record<br />\nBY MIKE VOGELBAUM<br />\nWith a longer schedule and a<br />\nlarger squad than last year, this<br />\nyear's wrestling team, coached<br />\nby former assistant coach John<br />\nKohler, has set high goals for<br />\nitself.<br />\nThe team has expanded its<br />\nschedule to 17 matches from 12<br />\nlast year. The schedule will<br />\ninclude several Division I opponents.<br />\nThis year, three seniors, two<br />\njuniors, four sophomores, and<br />\nthree freshmen will take to the<br />\nmats for Hopkins. Last year's<br />\nteam, which went 5-7, was<br />\nsomewhat smaller. \"The key ]to<br />\nthis season] is not to forfeit<br />\nmatches,\" Kohler said. \"Hopefully we can fill all weights.\"<br />\nThe lightweights will be<br />\nboosted as two of last year's<br />\nvoids will be filled by Eddie<br />\nBrown, at 118, and John<br />\nMandler, at 134. Kohler has<br />\nbeen impressed with Brown so<br />\nfar. \"He's got some good stuff<br />\nand he'll help us a lot,\" the<br />\ncoach commented. Brown, however, is out with an illness and<br />\nmay not return until after<br /><br />\nChristmas. Ned Berg will compete at 126 pounds.<br />\nReturning to the team after<br />\nmissing a year will be Kyle<br />\nHicks, at 142. Hicks, a senior,<br />\nplaced in tournaments two years<br />\nago. Lee Wagstaff and Todd<br />\nBaker, when he recovers from an<br />\ninjury, will also wrestle at 142.<br />\nJoel Eichler will compete at<br />\n150. Eichler, a sophomore, was<br />\ncalled \"last year's most consistent freshman\" by Kohler.<br />\nAt 158 will be John<br />\nMastrangello, and at 167 will be<br />\nGreg Haladyna. The coach remarked that the increase in<br />\nHaladyna's strength from last<br />\nyear is \"incredible.\" Haladyna<br />\nwon about 3/4 of his matches<br />\nlast year.<br />\nAs for the heavyweights,<br />\nRich Grohol will wrestle at 177,<br />\nFran Mullen, at 177 or 190, and<br />\nHaswell Franklin at 190 or<br />\nunlimited. Franklin and Mullen<br />\nplayed football, so they are not<br />\nin shape to wrestle yet, according to Kohler. The newcomers to<br />\nthe team, Jeff Greenspan, at<br />\n190, and Richard Chang, heavyweight, are \"coming along pretty<br />\nwell,\" said Kohler.<br /><br />\nThe major problem with the<br />\nteam is a lack of depth. \"Wrestling is probably the most demanding sport there is, and it<br />\ntakes its toll,\" said Kohler. The<br />\ncoach feels that many students<br />\nwho have wrestled before will<br />\nnot go out, because they are<br />\nafraid to do things that can hurt<br />\nthem, such as lose weight.<br />\nKohler added, \"We're a<br />\nvarsity sport in very heavy<br />\nacademic environment.- The<br />\nteam does not give scholarships;<br />\nthe team members participate<br />\nbecause they want to wrestle.\"I<br />\nkeep things in their proper<br />\nperspective and start from<br />\nthere,\" explained Kohler.<br />\nAs for this year's prospects,<br />\nKohler feels he has \"a better<br />\nteam than last year.\" He thinks<br />\nthe team can achieve a winning<br />\nseason. Kohler added, though,<br />\n\"Wrestling is an individual sport.<br />\nYou have to look and see how<br />\neach wrestler improved from last<br />\nyear.\" The coach feels that one<br />\nor two wrestlers will be able to<br />\nplace in the tournaments. Last<br />\nyear, none did.<br /><br />\nPAGE 22 / NOVEMBER 20, 1981<br />\n\u2022,\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nTAKE IT<br />\nEASY!<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTOO BUSY TO GET IT TYPED ?<br /><br />\nTyping<br /><br />\n41<br />\nServices<br /><br />\ni<br />\nlt4<br /><br />\nRESUMES<br />\n235-3500<br /><br />\n1c4<br />\n1c4<br /><br />\nNicholsonne &amp; Associates<br />\n2958 Greenmount Avenue<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland 21218<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022s\u2022sms\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n131<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022II al \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nAilarrie<br /><br />\nIMMIGRATION<br />\nPROBLEMS<br /><br />\nleIV Ile oili\u2022IV\"VWIC'RV 11`<br /><br />\n10011111114<br /><br />\nii4<br /><br />\nICINPAI<br />\nac.16.4(.41641.4164116416.11\u2022ACeilgoallirialovilovairibleillgeModereiCovitoll<br /><br />\n111<br /><br />\nTERM PAPERS\u2014REPORTS<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nrelleIV\"le<br /><br />\n$21<br />\nt4<br />\n1c4<br /><br />\nFRIDAY AND SATURDAY<br />\nMIDNIGHT<br />\nTHE TOWSON THEATRE PRESENTS<br />\nThe second in a series of Midnight shows.<br /><br />\nERASERHEAD<br />\nFRIDAY AND SATURDAY NOVEMBER 20 P! 21<br /><br />\nk_J<br />\nVrofelVoll.<br />\n41111<br />\ngeit`it`on<br />\n, IPV1114 WWII%is'isr<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1141114111,411\u2022\u2022\u2022\u20221\u20221\u202211\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022at,\u202216\u202241.Mr<br />\naldniliragoair alkallird<br />\n11011011011011011\u202211011011\u202211011\u202211011011011011011111110ii\u2022Iieli\u2022H\u20221111111\u2022111111101111111011011<br /><br />\nTO SUDS,<br /><br />\nCall 332-4150<br /><br />\nHEALTHY MALES 19-35<br /><br />\nWITH LOVE,<br /><br />\n\u2022Li S visa petitions and appeals\u2022Lab\u00b0,certifications<br />\n\u2022Defense against Cleporlatinn \u2022 Roative petanr,\u2022U S Otizenshq<br /><br />\nMay be eligible to<br />\nearn $100-$500 NOW!<br />\nP-K Laboratories asks you to join our<br />\nprogram as a participant in physician's<br />\nsupervised studies<br /><br />\nSHEENA<br /><br />\nLaw Offices:<br /><br />\nGordon &amp; Heneson.
