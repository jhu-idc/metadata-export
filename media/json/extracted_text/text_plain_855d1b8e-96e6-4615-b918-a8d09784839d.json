WJHU is no longer a campus<br />\nradio station, nor is it a student-managed<br />\nradio station. At the present time, WJHUFM does not exist, except as a memory in<br />\nthe minds of a few concerned students.<br />\nThe events leading up to this situation<br />\nshould be examined. As recently as a year<br />\nago, WJHU-FM was the campus radio station, located in the basement of AMR II,<br />\nand was student-managed. Interestingly<br />\nenough, the station was awarded the distinction of being named \"Baltimore's Best\" by<br />\nBaltimore Magazine. ,<br />\nSo what happened? AMR II was being<br />\nrenovated and WJHU was licensed by the<br />\nFederal Trade Commission to boost its wattage from 10 watts to 25,000 watts. The station went off the air to allow for the construction and power transition. This took<br />\nplace in the spring of this year and supposedly, broadcasting was to resume in early July.<br />\nIt is now early September and the status<br />\nof the radio station is significantly different<br />\nfrom that which was expected. The administration was unable to find a suitable<br />\nlocation for the station's offices and studios.<br />\nAdditionally, it has been decided that a professional station manager will be appointed<br />\n<br />\nto supervise the station's operation. It is currently estimated that WJHU-FM will finally resume broadcasting \"sometime next<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nIt is difficult to understand exactly how<br />\nwe, as students, should react to this predicament. For those previously active at the radio<br />\nstation, feelings of anger and of being<br />\nbetrayed are abundant. For those of us who<br />\nhave never dealt directly with WJHU, the<br />\nconcern is broader. Specifically, we must<br />\ndetermine how to respond to the administration's inability to act in a consistent manner in its attittide toward students.<br />\nThe moment we enter Hopkins, we are inundated with pressure to \"be adults.\" We<br />\nare encouraged to determine our own course<br />\nof study. We are encouraged to create and<br />\nrun student organizations. We are strongly<br />\nencouraged to live off campus. Yet, what<br />\nhappens when an opportunity arises in which<br />\nstudents can truly test their skills and even<br />\ndabble a bit in the \"real world?\" The administration comes to resemble an overanxious parent and manages to impose professional supervision.<br />\nSo, yes, the new WJHU-FM may do very<br />\nwell and, yes, the station may win more<br />\nawards than ever before. There actually may<br />\nbe a considerable amount of student input.<br />\nHowever, it will be difficult to take pride in<br />\nan organization that is no longer altogether<br />\nour own.<br />\nBy the way, welcome back.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nFederal blues<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have a Bachelor of Arts<br />\ndegree from Columbia University and am retired after having<br />\nworked for many years for the<br />\nFederal Government's Social<br />\nSecurity Administration and<br />\nHealth Care Financing Administration.

Federal Government<br />\nretirees formerly received a 1%<br />\nbonus added to their pensions<br />\nat the time of retirement and 2<br />\ncost-of-living increases each<br />\nyear, in order to at least fractionally compensate them for<br />\nthe low pay that they had been<br />\ngiven while working. Now they<br />\ndo not get the 1% add-on, and<br />\nthey receive only 1 cost-ofliving increase per year.<br />\n13. Federal retirees have to pay<br />\nincome tax on every cent of<br />\ntheir pensions once they get<br />\nback what they paid into their<br />\npension fund. The money that<br />\nthey paid into the pension fund<br />\nis not taxable, because taxes<br />\nwere paid on it by the retiree,<br />\nwhen he/she was working.<br />\n14.

But it also seemed an opportune moment to<br />\nwrite the eulogy for this financially troubled tribute to<br />\nmunicipal greed and myopia.<br />\nDismal showings at the gate<br />\nhere underscore how world's<br />\nfairs like New Orleans have not<br />\nonly outlived their usefulness,<br />\nbut also become certain disaster<br />\n<br />\nfor the cities they're supposed<br />\nto help. Leaving the New<br />\nOrleans fair to die a bitter death<br />\nmight teach city officials<br />\nelsewhere that cliches don't<br />\nmake for sound redevelopment.<br />\nWorld's fairs lost money in<br />\nthe 19th century, too, but there<br />\nwas a time when they were major educational events. People<br />\nfrom various nations and all<br />\nclasses traveled long distances<br />\nto view the latest advances in<br />\ntechnology. New ideas were<br />\ngenerated, old ideas were traded, and cultural trends such as<br />\nthe \"City Beautiful\" movement<br />\nof the 1930s were begun.<br />\n<br />\nHello...I<br />\n<br />\nEven in 1962, when Elvis<br />\nPresley starred in a movie<br />\nabout the Seattle World's Fair,<br />\nthe institution was still<br />\nsomething special. But these<br />\ndays, world's fairs are nothing<br />\nmore than wandering amusement parks, vehicles for city<br />\ncouncils and corporate sponsors to serve their own interests<br />\nand little more.<br />\nAnyone who visits this city's<br />\nfair quickly realizes that fact.<br />\nOn a recent evening we heard<br />\nthese reviews from tourists leaving the fairgrounds: \"disappointing,\" \"nothing much,\"<br />\n\"not bad for an amusement<br />\n<br />\nam<br />\n<br />\nyour<br />\n<br />\nnew faculty advisor.<br />\n<br />\nThis is niN picture.<br />\nThis is in signature.<br />\nTaice it.Learn it.<br />\n<br />\nUse it.Good luck<br />\n<br />\nthis semester.<br />\n<br />\nPJ'S<br />\n<br />\nPUB<br />\n<br />\npark,\" and \"it would have<br />\nbeen cooler at Disneyland.\"<br />\nIndeed, this fair, America's<br />\n22nd, can claim little of the<br />\nspectacle and excitement that<br />\nJudy Garland extolled in the<br />\nfilm, \"Meet Me in St. Louis.\"<br />\nThe international pavillions<br />\nhave been turned into cheap,<br />\nTijuana-style tourist traps.<br />\nTake the People's Republic of<br />\nChina exhibit, for example. Instead of Chinese culture and<br />\nadvances, the focus is on the<br />\nsale of inexpensive trinkets,<br />\nEven the genuine Chinese sales<br />\nclerks here laugh at being \"tattered capitalists.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, the fair's overall<br />\ntheme, fresh water as a source<br />\nof life, is probably the biggest<br />\njoke of all. In a pavillion that<br />\nresembles a walk-through<br />\naquarium, the oil industry<br />\n(which virtually runs this town)<br />\ntells what a fastidious job it's<br />\ndoing to clean the ocean water<br />\nnear its offshore rigs. Such a<br />\ndisplay, especially in a region<br />\nwhere oil slicks are common,<br />\nedges on incredulity.<br />\nWorse yet, from a visitor's<br />\npoint of view, it's boring. Big<br />\nleaps in technology occur less<br />\nfrequently than modern world's<br />\nfairs. What's more, what falls<br />\nin between can fit very well into Disney World's Epcot exhibits or a television producer's<br />\nstory list. Why drive to hot and<br />\nsteamy New Orleans to see<br />\nwhat you more or less saw in<br />\nKnoxville two years ago?<br />\nNonetheless, cities furiously<br />\ncompete for the right to stage<br />\n<br />\nthese tired extravaganzas. Major expositions suggest to public<br />\nofficials an easy way to salvage<br />\notherwise<br />\ninconsistent<br />\ndowntown development policy<br />\nwith private-sector funds.<br />\nResidual economic benefits<br />\nwere a key selling point for the<br />\nKnoxville fair's promoter, as<br />\nthey have been for New Orleans<br />\nand Chicago (1992) fair officials, too.<br />\nYet as Knoxville and New<br />\nOrleans have discovered to their<br />\ndismay, pre-fair hype rarely<br />\nmatches what follows. Vendors<br />\nin both cities have complained<br />\nthat they lost money instead of<br />\nmaking it. The number of new<br />\njobs has been overestimated.<br />\nPoorer neighborhoods, the<br />\nresidents of which don't constitute a prime market for highpriced expositions, have had to<br />\nbear the brunt of fair pressures<br />\non city services. Ultimately, as<br />\nLouisiana is finding out, taxpayers have footed more of the<br />\nbill than they expected.<br />\nWere world's fairs held every<br />\n10 years or even every five,<br />\nAmericans might view them<br />\nwith more anticipation. Change<br />\nand progress would be more in<br />\nevidence. The public and<br />\nPrivate sectors, drawing on<br />\nfinancial resources from<br />\naround the country, might<br />\navoid leaving taxpayers with an<br />\nunwanted tab.<br />\nBut, at the current rate, more<br />\nNew Orleans-style fiascos lie<br />\nwaiting.

S.<br />\nLo, Ph.D, research associate in<br />\nneuroscience; Tian Yow Tsong,<br />\nPh.D, associate professor of<br />\nphysiological chemistry; Lynda<br />\nD. Hester, neuroscience technician; and Mary Conrad and<br />\nStephen Strittmatter, students<br />\nat the School of Medicine.<br />\nMonoclonal antibodies are<br />\nproduced by a cell line that<br />\nscientists engineer by fusing two<br />\ntypes of cells. These are a B cell,<br />\none of the body's own diseasefighting white blood cells, and<br />\na cancer cell. The Snyder team<br />\nhas found a more efficient way<br />\nto make these hybrid cells,<br />\ndubbed \"hybridomas.\"<br />\nB cells patrol the body,<br />\nSnyder explains, searching for<br />\ndisease-causing organisms.<br />\nWhen they encounter an invader, they produce antibodies,<br />\nproteins that bind to substances<br />\non the invader's surface, immobilizing the unwanted<br />\nmicrobe and tagging it for later<br />\n<br />\ndistruction by other diseasefighting cells.<br />\nLike its B cell parent, a<br />\nhybridoma can make antibodies, and because of its<br />\ntumor cell parentage, it can do<br />\nso in much greater quantities<br />\nthan B cells. Another advantage of the hybrid is that it can<br />\nbe tailored to produce only one<br />\nkind of antibody, an asset<br />\nscientists find useful when they<br />\nwant to target only one kind of<br />\ncell for identification or<br />\ndestruction.<br />\n<br />\nThe hybridoma's product,<br />\nthe monoclonal antibody, is<br />\nalready used to identify diseasecausing organisms and<br />\nsubstances foreign to the body.<br />\nScientists also hope to attach<br />\nanti-cancer drugs to monoclonals.

This offers<br />\n<br />\nan advantage for diagnosing<br />\ncertain viral diseases, where only minute quantities of an offending substance are available.<br />\nThe most important advantage of the new technique is<br />\nthat antibodies produced by the<br />\nprocedure have, on average, a<br />\n100 times greater attraction to<br />\na given substance than usually<br />\noccurs with other techniques.<br />\nThis greatly increases the sensitivity of any diagnostic test using monoclonal antibodies.<br />\n<br />\nIn Vitro Fertilization Begins at Hospital<br />\nThree women from the first<br />\ngroup of women in the Johns<br />\nHopkins In Vitro Fertilization<br />\n(IVF)Program, which began in<br />\nMarch, are pregnant with \"test<br />\ntube babies.\" A fourth<br />\npregnancy ended in early<br />\nmiscarriage.

I got<br />\nthem during an advertising internship offered by the Advertising Association of Baltimore<br />\nthrough Bonnie Neuman, assistant to the Dean. I worked for<br />\neleven weeks at an advertising<br />\nagency on Charles Street in<br />\nreturn for a $1,000 scholarship.<br />\nWorking in the agency gave<br />\nme my first chance to meet and<br />\nassociate with real born-andbred Baltimoreans. These people knew every bar, restaurant,<br />\nand disco within 30 miles.<br />\nEntertainment aside, they were<br />\nespecially good when they got<br />\ndown to business. I never<br />\nrealized how much was involved in producing advertisements.<br />\nThere is the media department,<br />\nwhich buys time on radio and<br />\ntelevision stations, the traffic<br />\ndepartment, which distributes<br />\nto the printed media, account<br />\nexecutives who obtain instructions and information,<br />\ncopywriters who compose the<br />\nprinted and often-ignored statement on the 99c-0ff coupons,<br />\nand art directors who lay out<br />\nthe illustrations and print.<br />\nI worked in every department.

The agency's<br />\ncopywriters could think of<br />\nsomething bright and witty in a<br />\nfifteen-minute exchange of<br />\nideas.<br />\nMy work improved through<br />\nthe weeks as I figured out what<br />\nthe account executives wanted,<br />\nwhat the copywriters wanted,<br />\nand what was generally acceptable. For Wendy's danish ad,<br />\nI had an idea reminiscent of<br />\nAlice in Wonderland's cake; I<br />\nsuggested a piece of danish with<br />\nthe words \"Eat Me!\"<br />\nunderneath it.<br />\nEventually, I was given an<br />\naverage of one copywriting<br />\nassignment every two weeks. In<br />\nmy spare time I watched the<br />\nworking<br />\nartists<br />\nlayout<br />\nmeticulously with pens and<br />\nrulers. Who would think that<br />\nanyone would actually worry<br />\nabout fitting the Quality Inn<br />\nlogo on an ad in just the right<br />\nplace?

The<br />\nPrince has donated his private,<br />\nluxuriously equipped airplane<br />\nto fly his Highness and the<br />\nmovie crew out of Qram. The<br />\nreason given for this turnaround: The Prince requires expert neurological care to repair<br />\na headwound. The hospital he<br />\nowns in Los Angeles would be<br />\njust the place to take care of it.<br />\nSo everybody who could be<br />\nfound and/or woken up is<br />\nrushed to the tiny, freshly built<br />\nairport and piled into the flying<br />\nhotel.<br />\nIt's after takeoff that the fun<br />\nbegins. One by one, seemingly<br />\nunrelated passengers are found<br />\nmurdered, all by the same<br />\nmethod. Kennedy's buddy,<br />\nMike Corby, a cop-turnedactor (he plays cops), is voted<br />\nchief detective by the remaining<br />\npassengers. He does have the<br />\nmost experience at this sort of<br />\nthing. While he sorts through<br />\nthe clues (a monumental task<br />\nwithout immediate access to<br />\ncriminal files and related computer data) more murders are<br />\nsuccessfully completed. All this<br />\ntime, the Prince is secluded in<br />\nthe master bedroom, a<br />\nbodyguard posted at the door,<br />\nand his chief of staff by his<br />\nside. Oh,and did I mention the<br />\nplane must fly nonstop to LA,<br />\ndipping dangerously into the<br />\nregulation safety margin of<br />\nminumum fuel reserve?<br />\nThe bodies pile up (they are<br />\nbeing stashed in the cargo compartment. Yuck!) but they cannot land. If the Prince should<br />\nexpire...So on they travel, a<br />\nlong flight filled with excitement, danger and political intrigue. Kennedy spends most of<br />\nthe time trying to get some sleep<br />\nbut the twisting plot simply<br />\nwon't let him rest.<br />\nThe story loses some of its<br />\npotential intensity because there<br />\nare so many possible suspects.<br />\nThe reader is not allowed to<br />\n<br />\nknow most of the characters<br />\nvery well, so he or she does not<br />\ncare if they kill or are killed; the<br />\nnon-fictional people, one can<br />\nassume, will not be indicted. I<br />\nfound it frustrating that I did<br />\nnot have all the information<br />\nthat would actually have been<br />\navailable, but had to be<br />\nsatisfied with what Kennedy<br />\nchose to reveal.<br />\nThroughout the novel, Kennedy relies on the conceit that<br />\nas an actor, it is his profession<br />\nto study human nature and to<br />\nfigure out what motivates people. Therefore, he should make<br />\na decent detective. However,<br />\nhis character plays no significant part in finally discovering<br />\n\"whodunit\". Mike must take<br />\nfull credit for correctly unmasking the murderer (and his/her<br />\nmotives!). George Kennedy<br />\nplays Dutch uncle instead,<br />\nlistening to people's problems<br />\nand making them think he<br />\nhelped solve them. While this<br />\nrounds out some of the flimsiness of his supporting<br />\ncharacters, Kennedy does not<br />\nuse all this free and easy information to solve the murders.<br />\nThe purpose of these sessions<br />\nseemed to be, in retrospect, to<br />\ndistract your attention, making<br />\nyou think that any one of the<br />\npassengers might have a reason<br />\nto murder their fellows in cold<br />\nblood.<br />\nMurder on High has its faults<br />\nbut is overall a fun book. Fastpaced (a middle section of the<br />\nnovel ends every short chapter<br />\nwith another murder), it requires little or no thought,<br />\ndepending upon how responsible you feel to guess the<br />\nmurderer before the final page.<br />\nThe denouement was not a<br />\ncomplete surprise, as in the best<br />\nChristie classics, but in real life<br />\nit seldom is. All in all, Kennedy<br />\n. has created an entertaining,<br />\neasy-to-read novel; even if you<br />\nhate the book, you haven't<br />\nwasted more than an afternoon<br />\nanyway.<br />\n<br />\nFree Noontime Concert<br />\nIrish Pub Music by<br />\n<br />\nCHANGE OF PACE<br />\nTuesday, September 11<br />\n12 noon \u2014 2 PM<br />\nLevering Patio<br />\nSponsored by<br />\nStudent Activities<br />\n<br />\n+++.1.444+4.444447+++++44<br />\n<br />\n\f12/SEPTEMBER 7, 1984<br />\nDi-<br />\n<br />\nOC=EN:111C11:1C1<br />\n<br />\n3C1EROS<br />\n10L<br />\n<br />\n'Dl<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nJIGAMSA<br />\nJewish Interprofessionals, Graduate<br />\nAnd Medical Students Association<br />\n<br />\nYOU'VE TRIED THE<br />\nREST..NOW TRY<br />\nTHE BEST!<br />\n<br />\nPresents<br />\n<br />\nA Night of<br />\nCornedy and Magic_<br />\nfeaturing live performances by:<br />\n<br />\nASO<br />\n<br />\nJames VanLiew<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nTony Perkins<br />\n9:30 pm<br />\nSaturday, Sept. 15<br />\n$4.50 Admission<br />\nCash Bar<br />\nThe Rathskellar, JHU Homewood Campus<br />\nFor info, call: Rita 922-8343 / Bill 484-4074<br />\n<br />\nmcsaamoramomatiois3o3orago<br />\n<br />\nOIME31:1<br />\n<br />\nPROUD OF ITS<br />\nSTORE<br />\nA<br />\nIS<br />\nRECORDM ASTERS EVERY TYPE OF MUSIC<br />\nGREAT SELECTION IN<br />\n<br />\n3107 St. Paul St.<br />\n<br />\nFREE DELIVERY\u2022 243-1611<br />\nDelivery Boundaries<br />\n<br />\nPIZZA<br />\n<br />\nimport selection!<br />\nincluding an excellent<br />\n\u2022 ROCK<br />\nZ-Z-Topp,<br />\nto<br />\nfrom Alice Cooper<br />\nhard -to -get ones!<br />\nBaltimore we have the<br />\n\u2022 JAZZ<br />\nin<br />\ncollection<br />\nthe most exciting<br />\nBluegrass, try us!<br />\n\u2022 BLUE GRASS<br />\nlooking for obscure<br />\nit you're<br />\nrecordings!<br />\nimports and rare<br />\n\u2022 CLASSICSselection in every way with plenty of<br />\ncomplete<br />\nmore!<br />\nSPOKEN WORD, Many<br />\n\u2022 FOLK,<br />\nselection Over 1000<br />\n\u2022 VIDEO<br />\nhighly acclaimed<br />\nour<br />\nfrom<br />\nextensive library<br />\nfee<br />\ntiles\u2014no membership<br />\n<br />\n111<br />\nCOUPON111<br />\n111111<br />\nMO NM/IEll MI<br />\n<br />\nNORTHERN PKWY<br />\n<br />\nBONUSCOUPON AND PURCHASE<br />\n<br />\nBEER<br />\nIN:MILANO AVE.<br />\n<br />\nMonday-Friday<br />\n5:30 pm-1 am<br />\nSaturday & Sunday<br />\nNoon-1 am<br />\n<br />\nNOTRE DAME<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\nLOYOLA<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\n<br />\nBRING IN THIS<br />\nRENTAL<br />\nTAPE OR VIDEO<br />\nANY ONE LP,<br />\n<br />\nI 15%OFF<br />\n<br />\nREO.

For the first<br />\ntime in recent memory,<br />\nHopkins was in danger of<br />\nallowing a class to graduate<br />\nwithout being number one.<br />\nIf there was no doubt during<br />\nthe game, at least there was apprehension. After blazing<br />\nahead 6-0 on the strength of<br />\nthree opening goals by<br />\nfreshman Brian Wood,<br />\nHopkins<br />\nthe<br />\nallowed<br />\nOrangemen to surge to within<br />\none goal. Syracuse, a<br />\nremarkable comeback team,<br />\nwas threatening to take control.<br />\nWith vivid memories of last<br />\nyear's championship game, in<br />\n<br />\nwhich Hopkins saw a thirdquarter 12-5 lead turn into a<br />\n17-16 loss, Zimmerman called<br />\na timeout. The first-year coach<br />\ntold his team to relax and to<br />\nconcentrate on team play. The<br />\nBlue Jays responded by scoring<br />\nthree goals in the next two<br />\nminutes to pull away.<br />\nHopkins' defense then took<br />\nover with first team AllAmerican and game MVP<br />\nLarry Quinn extinguishing the<br />\nfirepower of Syracuse's highscoring attack. Several of<br />\nQuinn's saves were among his<br />\nfinest and secured his position<br />\nas the nation's top goaltender.<br />\n\"That game was for the<br />\nseniors,\" Zimmerman said of<br />\nthe victory. \"I was tremendously happy for those guys.\" Eight<br />\nmembers of the class of 1984<br />\n<br />\nhad led the team throughout<br />\nthe season, which began on<br />\nMarch 10 with a 10-8 victory<br />\nover UMBC. The championship game capped a 14-0 season<br />\nfor the Blue Jays under Coach<br />\nZimmerman.<br />\n\"It wasn't supposed to turn<br />\nout the way it did,\" asserted the<br />\nSyracuse University Alumni<br />\nNews in its recap of the 1984<br />\nseason. For the Orangemen, the<br />\ndefeat put an end to its 21-game<br />\nwinning streak which dated<br />\nback to an April 23, 1984, loss<br />\nto Army.<br />\n\"As one of our coaches said<br />\non the happy bus ride from<br />\nNewark to Baltimore,\" Zimmerman noted, \"it was a<br />\nperfect ending to a perfect<br />\nseason.\"<br />\n<br />\nHopkins All-Americans<br />\nStars of the 1984 Season<br />\n<br />\nHopkins.

WJHU is no longer a campus<br />\nradio station, nor is it a student-managed<br />\nradio station. At the present time, WJHUFM does not exist, except as a memory in<br />\nthe minds of a few concerned students.<br />\nThe events leading up to this situation<br />\nshould be examined. As recently as a year<br />\nago, WJHU-FM was the campus radio station, located in the basement of AMR II,<br />\nand was student-managed. Interestingly<br />\nenough, the station was awarded the distinction of being named \"Baltimore's Best\" by<br />\nBaltimore Magazine. ,<br />\nSo what happened? AMR II was being<br />\nrenovated and WJHU was licensed by the<br />\nFederal Trade Commission to boost its wattage from 10 watts to 25,000 watts. The station went off the air to allow for the construction and power transition. This took<br />\nplace in the spring of this year and supposedly, broadcasting was to resume in early July.<br />\nIt is now early September and the status<br />\nof the radio station is significantly different<br />\nfrom that which was expected. The administration was unable to find a suitable<br />\nlocation for the station's offices and studios.<br />\nAdditionally, it has been decided that a professional station manager will be appointed<br /><br />\nto supervise the station's operation. It is currently estimated that WJHU-FM will finally resume broadcasting \"sometime next<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nIt is difficult to understand exactly how<br />\nwe, as students, should react to this predicament. For those previously active at the radio<br />\nstation, feelings of anger and of being<br />\nbetrayed are abundant. For those of us who<br />\nhave never dealt directly with WJHU, the<br />\nconcern is broader. Specifically, we must<br />\ndetermine how to respond to the administration's inability to act in a consistent manner in its attittide toward students.<br />\nThe moment we enter Hopkins, we are inundated with pressure to \"be adults.\" We<br />\nare encouraged to determine our own course<br />\nof study. We are encouraged to create and<br />\nrun student organizations. We are strongly<br />\nencouraged to live off campus. Yet, what<br />\nhappens when an opportunity arises in which<br />\nstudents can truly test their skills and even<br />\ndabble a bit in the \"real world?\" The administration comes to resemble an overanxious parent and manages to impose professional supervision.<br />\nSo, yes, the new WJHU-FM may do very<br />\nwell and, yes, the station may win more<br />\nawards than ever before. There actually may<br />\nbe a considerable amount of student input.<br />\nHowever, it will be difficult to take pride in<br />\nan organization that is no longer altogether<br />\nour own.<br />\nBy the way, welcome back.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nFederal blues<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI have a Bachelor of Arts<br />\ndegree from Columbia University and am retired after having<br />\nworked for many years for the<br />\nFederal Government's Social<br />\nSecurity Administration and<br />\nHealth Care Financing Administration.

But it also seemed an opportune moment to<br />\nwrite the eulogy for this financially troubled tribute to<br />\nmunicipal greed and myopia.<br />\nDismal showings at the gate<br />\nhere underscore how world's<br />\nfairs like New Orleans have not<br />\nonly outlived their usefulness,<br />\nbut also become certain disaster<br /><br />\nfor the cities they're supposed<br />\nto help. Leaving the New<br />\nOrleans fair to die a bitter death<br />\nmight teach city officials<br />\nelsewhere that cliches don't<br />\nmake for sound redevelopment.<br />\nWorld's fairs lost money in<br />\nthe 19th century, too, but there<br />\nwas a time when they were major educational events. People<br />\nfrom various nations and all<br />\nclasses traveled long distances<br />\nto view the latest advances in<br />\ntechnology. New ideas were<br />\ngenerated, old ideas were traded, and cultural trends such as<br />\nthe \"City Beautiful\" movement<br />\nof the 1930s were begun.<br /><br />\nHello...I<br /><br />\nEven in 1962, when Elvis<br />\nPresley starred in a movie<br />\nabout the Seattle World's Fair,<br />\nthe institution was still<br />\nsomething special. But these<br />\ndays, world's fairs are nothing<br />\nmore than wandering amusement parks, vehicles for city<br />\ncouncils and corporate sponsors to serve their own interests<br />\nand little more.<br />\nAnyone who visits this city's<br />\nfair quickly realizes that fact.<br />\nOn a recent evening we heard<br />\nthese reviews from tourists leaving the fairgrounds: \"disappointing,\" \"nothing much,\"<br />\n\"not bad for an amusement<br /><br />\nam<br /><br />\nyour<br /><br />\nnew faculty advisor.<br /><br />\nThis is niN picture.<br />\nThis is in signature.<br />\nTaice it.Learn it.<br /><br />\nUse it.Good luck<br /><br />\nthis semester.<br /><br />\nPJ'S<br /><br />\nPUB<br /><br />\npark,\" and \"it would have<br />\nbeen cooler at Disneyland.\"<br />\nIndeed, this fair, America's<br />\n22nd, can claim little of the<br />\nspectacle and excitement that<br />\nJudy Garland extolled in the<br />\nfilm, \"Meet Me in St. Louis.\"<br />\nThe international pavillions<br />\nhave been turned into cheap,<br />\nTijuana-style tourist traps.<br />\nTake the People's Republic of<br />\nChina exhibit, for example. Instead of Chinese culture and<br />\nadvances, the focus is on the<br />\nsale of inexpensive trinkets,<br />\nEven the genuine Chinese sales<br />\nclerks here laugh at being \"tattered capitalists.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, the fair's overall<br />\ntheme, fresh water as a source<br />\nof life, is probably the biggest<br />\njoke of all. In a pavillion that<br />\nresembles a walk-through<br />\naquarium, the oil industry<br />\n(which virtually runs this town)<br />\ntells what a fastidious job it's<br />\ndoing to clean the ocean water<br />\nnear its offshore rigs. Such a<br />\ndisplay, especially in a region<br />\nwhere oil slicks are common,<br />\nedges on incredulity.<br />\nWorse yet, from a visitor's<br />\npoint of view, it's boring. Big<br />\nleaps in technology occur less<br />\nfrequently than modern world's<br />\nfairs. What's more, what falls<br />\nin between can fit very well into Disney World's Epcot exhibits or a television producer's<br />\nstory list. Why drive to hot and<br />\nsteamy New Orleans to see<br />\nwhat you more or less saw in<br />\nKnoxville two years ago?<br />\nNonetheless, cities furiously<br />\ncompete for the right to stage<br /><br />\nthese tired extravaganzas. Major expositions suggest to public<br />\nofficials an easy way to salvage<br />\notherwise<br />\ninconsistent<br />\ndowntown development policy<br />\nwith private-sector funds.<br />\nResidual economic benefits<br />\nwere a key selling point for the<br />\nKnoxville fair's promoter, as<br />\nthey have been for New Orleans<br />\nand Chicago (1992) fair officials, too.<br />\nYet as Knoxville and New<br />\nOrleans have discovered to their<br />\ndismay, pre-fair hype rarely<br />\nmatches what follows. Vendors<br />\nin both cities have complained<br />\nthat they lost money instead of<br />\nmaking it. The number of new<br />\njobs has been overestimated.<br />\nPoorer neighborhoods, the<br />\nresidents of which don't constitute a prime market for highpriced expositions, have had to<br />\nbear the brunt of fair pressures<br />\non city services. Ultimately, as<br />\nLouisiana is finding out, taxpayers have footed more of the<br />\nbill than they expected.<br />\nWere world's fairs held every<br />\n10 years or even every five,<br />\nAmericans might view them<br />\nwith more anticipation. Change<br />\nand progress would be more in<br />\nevidence. The public and<br />\nPrivate sectors, drawing on<br />\nfinancial resources from<br />\naround the country, might<br />\navoid leaving taxpayers with an<br />\nunwanted tab.<br />\nBut, at the current rate, more<br />\nNew Orleans-style fiascos lie<br />\nwaiting.

S.<br />\nLo, Ph.D, research associate in<br />\nneuroscience; Tian Yow Tsong,<br />\nPh.D, associate professor of<br />\nphysiological chemistry; Lynda<br />\nD. Hester, neuroscience technician; and Mary Conrad and<br />\nStephen Strittmatter, students<br />\nat the School of Medicine.<br />\nMonoclonal antibodies are<br />\nproduced by a cell line that<br />\nscientists engineer by fusing two<br />\ntypes of cells. These are a B cell,<br />\none of the body's own diseasefighting white blood cells, and<br />\na cancer cell. The Snyder team<br />\nhas found a more efficient way<br />\nto make these hybrid cells,<br />\ndubbed \"hybridomas.\"<br />\nB cells patrol the body,<br />\nSnyder explains, searching for<br />\ndisease-causing organisms.<br />\nWhen they encounter an invader, they produce antibodies,<br />\nproteins that bind to substances<br />\non the invader's surface, immobilizing the unwanted<br />\nmicrobe and tagging it for later<br /><br />\ndistruction by other diseasefighting cells.<br />\nLike its B cell parent, a<br />\nhybridoma can make antibodies, and because of its<br />\ntumor cell parentage, it can do<br />\nso in much greater quantities<br />\nthan B cells. Another advantage of the hybrid is that it can<br />\nbe tailored to produce only one<br />\nkind of antibody, an asset<br />\nscientists find useful when they<br />\nwant to target only one kind of<br />\ncell for identification or<br />\ndestruction.<br /><br />\nThe hybridoma's product,<br />\nthe monoclonal antibody, is<br />\nalready used to identify diseasecausing organisms and<br />\nsubstances foreign to the body.<br />\nScientists also hope to attach<br />\nanti-cancer drugs to monoclonals. The antibodies would<br />\nthen zero in on a tumor, delivering the drug to exactly<br />\nwhere it is needed and sparing<br />\nthe rest of the body from any<br />\nof the drug's damaging effects.<br />\nThe problem with the old<br />\nmethod, Snyder says, is that<br /><br />\nscientists have no control over<br />\nthe number of cells that stick<br />\ntogether and often are left with<br />\nclusters of four and five cells<br />\nthat have no useful function.<br />\nYields of the conventionally<br />\nproduced hybrid usually range<br />\nfrom one to five percent, as<br />\ncompared with almost 100 percent with the Hopkins method.<br />\nThe new technique also requires smaller amounts of the<br />\nsubstances needed to stimulate<br />\nantibody production than does<br />\nthe old technique. This offers<br /><br />\nan advantage for diagnosing<br />\ncertain viral diseases, where only minute quantities of an offending substance are available.<br />\nThe most important advantage of the new technique is<br />\nthat antibodies produced by the<br />\nprocedure have, on average, a<br />\n100 times greater attraction to<br />\na given substance than usually<br />\noccurs with other techniques.<br />\nThis greatly increases the sensitivity of any diagnostic test using monoclonal antibodies.<br /><br />\nIn Vitro Fertilization Begins at Hospital<br />\nThree women from the first<br />\ngroup of women in the Johns<br />\nHopkins In Vitro Fertilization<br />\n(IVF)Program, which began in<br />\nMarch, are pregnant with \"test<br />\ntube babies.\" A fourth<br />\npregnancy ended in early<br />\nmiscarriage. Some 25 women<br />\ncurrently are scheduled for the<br />\nprogram at Hopkins and 200<br />\nare on a waiting list.<br />\nThe in vitro fertilization pro.gram is designed for couples<br />\nunable to conceive and who<br />\nhave exhausted other treatments for infertility. In IVF,<br />\nphysicians remove ova (eggs)<br />\nfrom a woman's ovary, fertilize<br />\nthem in the laboratory with her<br />\nhusband's sperm, and return<br />\nthem to her uterus.<br />\nThe four basic steps involved are:<br /><br />\n\u2022Hormonal stimulation.<br />\nWomen take a fertility drug,<br />\nPergonal, at the beginning of the<br />\nmenstrual cycle to enhance egg<br />\nmaturity and release.

Of Jimmy Carter's<br />\nsummer at Georgia U., we<br />\nknow only that he made great<br />\nturkey hash.

From my pen also<br />\nflowed the profundity: \"Only<br />\none coupon per customer.\" I<br />\nattained another addition to my<br />\nresume, a counter card which<br />\nread: \"Try our fresh breakfast<br />\ndanish, only 59'.\"<br />\nAt this point, you should certainly be impressed by my<br />\ncreative opportunities. I got<br />\nthem during an advertising internship offered by the Advertising Association of Baltimore<br />\nthrough Bonnie Neuman, assistant to the Dean. I worked for<br />\neleven weeks at an advertising<br />\nagency on Charles Street in<br />\nreturn for a $1,000 scholarship.<br />\nWorking in the agency gave<br />\nme my first chance to meet and<br />\nassociate with real born-andbred Baltimoreans. These people knew every bar, restaurant,<br />\nand disco within 30 miles.<br />\nEntertainment aside, they were<br />\nespecially good when they got<br />\ndown to business. I never<br />\nrealized how much was involved in producing advertisements.<br />\nThere is the media department,<br />\nwhich buys time on radio and<br />\ntelevision stations, the traffic<br />\ndepartment, which distributes<br />\nto the printed media, account<br />\nexecutives who obtain instructions and information,<br />\ncopywriters who compose the<br />\nprinted and often-ignored statement on the 99c-0ff coupons,<br />\nand art directors who lay out<br />\nthe illustrations and print.<br />\nI worked in every department. I was given large books<br />\nof award-winning ads to study.<br />\nLater I was shown ads that my<br />\nemploying ad agency had done,<br />\nand eventually the moment<br />\ncame. Could I or could I not<br />\nproduce a 10%-off coupon<br /><br />\nv s<br />\nowes<br />\n\"\"<br />\nfor Ship 'n' Shore? I could not. the air force and now<br />\nI had no background or<br />\npreparation. It took me a week<br />\nof thought to produce<br />\nthoroughly<br />\nsomething<br />\nunuseable. The agency's<br />\ncopywriters could think of<br />\nsomething bright and witty in a<br />\nfifteen-minute exchange of<br />\nideas.<br />\nMy work improved through<br />\nthe weeks as I figured out what<br />\nthe account executives wanted,<br />\nwhat the copywriters wanted,<br />\nand what was generally acceptable. For Wendy's danish ad,<br />\nI had an idea reminiscent of<br />\nAlice in Wonderland's cake; I<br />\nsuggested a piece of danish with<br />\nthe words \"Eat Me!\"<br />\nunderneath it.<br />\nEventually, I was given an<br />\naverage of one copywriting<br />\nassignment every two weeks. In<br />\nmy spare time I watched the<br />\nworking<br />\nartists<br />\nlayout<br />\nmeticulously with pens and<br />\nrulers. Who would think that<br />\nanyone would actually worry<br />\nabout fitting the Quality Inn<br />\nlogo on an ad in just the right<br />\nplace? I also worked in the<br />\nprint traffic department, typing<br />\nand handing out a great deal of<br />\njob assignments every day, and<br />\ngetting the receptionist into<br />\ntrouble f6r chatting while on<br />\nthe iob.

The<br />\nPrince has donated his private,<br />\nluxuriously equipped airplane<br />\nto fly his Highness and the<br />\nmovie crew out of Qram. The<br />\nreason given for this turnaround: The Prince requires expert neurological care to repair<br />\na headwound. The hospital he<br />\nowns in Los Angeles would be<br />\njust the place to take care of it.<br />\nSo everybody who could be<br />\nfound and/or woken up is<br />\nrushed to the tiny, freshly built<br />\nairport and piled into the flying<br />\nhotel.<br />\nIt's after takeoff that the fun<br />\nbegins. One by one, seemingly<br />\nunrelated passengers are found<br />\nmurdered, all by the same<br />\nmethod. Kennedy's buddy,<br />\nMike Corby, a cop-turnedactor (he plays cops), is voted<br />\nchief detective by the remaining<br />\npassengers. He does have the<br />\nmost experience at this sort of<br />\nthing. While he sorts through<br />\nthe clues (a monumental task<br />\nwithout immediate access to<br />\ncriminal files and related computer data) more murders are<br />\nsuccessfully completed. All this<br />\ntime, the Prince is secluded in<br />\nthe master bedroom, a<br />\nbodyguard posted at the door,<br />\nand his chief of staff by his<br />\nside. Oh,and did I mention the<br />\nplane must fly nonstop to LA,<br />\ndipping dangerously into the<br />\nregulation safety margin of<br />\nminumum fuel reserve?<br />\nThe bodies pile up (they are<br />\nbeing stashed in the cargo compartment. Yuck!) but they cannot land. If the Prince should<br />\nexpire...So on they travel, a<br />\nlong flight filled with excitement, danger and political intrigue. Kennedy spends most of<br />\nthe time trying to get some sleep<br />\nbut the twisting plot simply<br />\nwon't let him rest.<br />\nThe story loses some of its<br />\npotential intensity because there<br />\nare so many possible suspects.<br />\nThe reader is not allowed to<br /><br />\nknow most of the characters<br />\nvery well, so he or she does not<br />\ncare if they kill or are killed; the<br />\nnon-fictional people, one can<br />\nassume, will not be indicted. I<br />\nfound it frustrating that I did<br />\nnot have all the information<br />\nthat would actually have been<br />\navailable, but had to be<br />\nsatisfied with what Kennedy<br />\nchose to reveal.<br />\nThroughout the novel, Kennedy relies on the conceit that<br />\nas an actor, it is his profession<br />\nto study human nature and to<br />\nfigure out what motivates people. Therefore, he should make<br />\na decent detective. However,<br />\nhis character plays no significant part in finally discovering<br />\n\"whodunit\". Mike must take<br />\nfull credit for correctly unmasking the murderer (and his/her<br />\nmotives!). George Kennedy<br />\nplays Dutch uncle instead,<br />\nlistening to people's problems<br />\nand making them think he<br />\nhelped solve them. While this<br />\nrounds out some of the flimsiness of his supporting<br />\ncharacters, Kennedy does not<br />\nuse all this free and easy information to solve the murders.<br />\nThe purpose of these sessions<br />\nseemed to be, in retrospect, to<br />\ndistract your attention, making<br />\nyou think that any one of the<br />\npassengers might have a reason<br />\nto murder their fellows in cold<br />\nblood.<br />\nMurder on High has its faults<br />\nbut is overall a fun book. Fastpaced (a middle section of the<br />\nnovel ends every short chapter<br />\nwith another murder), it requires little or no thought,<br />\ndepending upon how responsible you feel to guess the<br />\nmurderer before the final page.<br />\nThe denouement was not a<br />\ncomplete surprise, as in the best<br />\nChristie classics, but in real life<br />\nit seldom is. All in all, Kennedy<br />\n. has created an entertaining,<br />\neasy-to-read novel; even if you<br />\nhate the book, you haven't<br />\nwasted more than an afternoon<br />\nanyway.<br /><br />\nFree Noontime Concert<br />\nIrish Pub Music by<br /><br />\nCHANGE OF PACE<br />\nTuesday, September 11<br />\n12 noon \u2014 2 PM<br />\nLevering Patio<br />\nSponsored by<br />\nStudent Activities<br /><br />\n+++.1.444+4.444447+++++44<br /><br />\n12/SEPTEMBER 7, 1984<br />\nDi-<br /><br />\nOC=EN:111C11:1C1<br /><br />\n3C1EROS<br />\n10L<br /><br />\n'Dl<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br /><br />\nJIGAMSA<br />\nJewish Interprofessionals, Graduate<br />\nAnd Medical Students Association<br /><br />\nYOU'VE TRIED THE<br />\nREST..NOW TRY<br />\nTHE BEST!<br /><br />\nPresents<br /><br />\nA Night of<br />\nCornedy and Magic_<br />\nfeaturing live performances by:<br /><br />\nASO<br /><br />\nJames VanLiew<br />\nand<br /><br />\nTony Perkins<br />\n9:30 pm<br />\nSaturday, Sept. 15<br />\n$4.50 Admission<br />\nCash Bar<br />\nThe Rathskellar, JHU Homewood Campus<br />\nFor info, call: Rita 922-8343 / Bill 484-4074<br /><br />\nmcsaamoramomatiois3o3orago<br /><br />\nOIME31:1<br /><br />\nPROUD OF ITS<br />\nSTORE<br />\nA<br />\nIS<br />\nRECORDM ASTERS EVERY TYPE OF MUSIC<br />\nGREAT SELECTION IN<br /><br />\n3107 St. Paul St.<br /><br />\nFREE DELIVERY\u2022 243-1611<br />\nDelivery Boundaries<br /><br />\nPIZZA<br /><br />\nimport selection!<br />\nincluding an excellent<br />\n\u2022 ROCK<br />\nZ-Z-Topp,<br />\nto<br />\nfrom Alice Cooper<br />\nhard -to -get ones!<br />\nBaltimore we have the<br />\n\u2022 JAZZ<br />\nin<br />\ncollection<br />\nthe most exciting<br />\nBluegrass, try us!<br />\n\u2022 BLUE GRASS<br />\nlooking for obscure<br />\nit you're<br />\nrecordings!<br />\nimports and rare<br />\n\u2022 CLASSICSselection in every way with plenty of<br />\ncomplete<br />\nmore!<br />\nSPOKEN WORD, Many<br />\n\u2022 FOLK,<br />\nselection Over 1000<br />\n\u2022 VIDEO<br />\nhighly acclaimed<br />\nour<br />\nfrom<br />\nextensive library<br />\nfee<br />\ntiles\u2014no membership<br /><br />\n111<br />\nCOUPON111<br />\n111111<br />\nMO NM/IEll MI<br /><br />\nNORTHERN PKWY<br /><br />\nBONUSCOUPON AND PURCHASE<br /><br />\nBEER<br />\nIN:MILANO AVE.<br /><br />\nMonday-Friday<br />\n5:30 pm-1 am<br />\nSaturday &amp; Sunday<br />\nNoon-1 am<br /><br />\nNOTRE DAME<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\nLOYOLA<br />\nCOLLEGE<br /><br />\nBRING IN THIS<br />\nRENTAL<br />\nTAPE OR VIDEO<br />\nANY ONE LP,<br /><br />\nI 15%OFF<br /><br />\nREO.

For the first<br />\ntime in recent memory,<br />\nHopkins was in danger of<br />\nallowing a class to graduate<br />\nwithout being number one.<br />\nIf there was no doubt during<br />\nthe game, at least there was apprehension. After blazing<br />\nahead 6-0 on the strength of<br />\nthree opening goals by<br />\nfreshman Brian Wood,<br />\nHopkins<br />\nthe<br />\nallowed<br />\nOrangemen to surge to within<br />\none goal. Syracuse, a<br />\nremarkable comeback team,<br />\nwas threatening to take control.<br />\nWith vivid memories of last<br />\nyear's championship game, in<br /><br />\nwhich Hopkins saw a thirdquarter 12-5 lead turn into a<br />\n17-16 loss, Zimmerman called<br />\na timeout. The first-year coach<br />\ntold his team to relax and to<br />\nconcentrate on team play. The<br />\nBlue Jays responded by scoring<br />\nthree goals in the next two<br />\nminutes to pull away.<br />\nHopkins' defense then took<br />\nover with first team AllAmerican and game MVP<br />\nLarry Quinn extinguishing the<br />\nfirepower of Syracuse's highscoring attack. Several of<br />\nQuinn's saves were among his<br />\nfinest and secured his position<br />\nas the nation's top goaltender.<br />\n\"That game was for the<br />\nseniors,\" Zimmerman said of<br />\nthe victory. \"I was tremendously happy for those guys.\" Eight<br />\nmembers of the class of 1984<br /><br />\nhad led the team throughout<br />\nthe season, which began on<br />\nMarch 10 with a 10-8 victory<br />\nover UMBC. The championship game capped a 14-0 season<br />\nfor the Blue Jays under Coach<br />\nZimmerman.<br />\n\"It wasn't supposed to turn<br />\nout the way it did,\" asserted the<br />\nSyracuse University Alumni<br />\nNews in its recap of the 1984<br />\nseason. For the Orangemen, the<br />\ndefeat put an end to its 21-game<br />\nwinning streak which dated<br />\nback to an April 23, 1984, loss<br />\nto Army.<br />\n\"As one of our coaches said<br />\non the happy bus ride from<br />\nNewark to Baltimore,\" Zimmerman noted, \"it was a<br />\nperfect ending to a perfect<br />\nseason.\"<br /><br />\nHopkins All-Americans<br />\nStars of the 1984 Season<br /><br />\nHopkins.
