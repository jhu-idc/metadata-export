Students and friends of the<br />\nUniversity are invited to witness<br />\nthe drill.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins football team journeyed up to Pennsylvania<br />\nlast Saturday and returned with 17-10 victory over Haverford College,<br />\nthe first one for the Black and Blue in five years. The game was hardfought throughout, and devoted chiefly to old-style football, with a few<br />\nforward passes. From the first, Hopkins showed a decided advantage,<br />\nand was generally able to make substantial gains through the Quaker<br />\nline, although inside the 20-yard line the Niter played a wonderful<br />\ndefensive game. It's a matter of fact, the contest was more one-sided<br />\nthan the mere score indicates, for Hopkins made 11 first down to 4 for<br />\nHaverford, and in all probability might have had two more touchdowns if attempts for a field goal had not been made. The Black and<br />\nBlue also completed.four passes, while the Quakers worked only two of<br />\nmany attempts.<br />\nEvery man in the back field did his share in gaining ground, al'though Jones and Calkins were most successful in advancing the ball.<br />\nA notable improvement in defense against forward passes and in<br />\ntackling was seen, while time and again the Hopkins men broke through<br />\nand pulled down the Haverford runner for a loss. In the last period<br />\nnearly the whole Black and Blue line seemed to surge on and a dozen<br />\nhands catch an attempted pass that a moment later was turned into<br />\nthe winning touchdown. Middleton and the Wood brothers were<br />\nalways down the field under a kick, ready to drop the runner in his<br />\ntracks, and Middleton was right there in the third period to fall on a<br />\nfumbled ball, thus starting an advance that ended with a beautiful 40yard drop-kick by Calkins.<br />\nFrom the Haverford viewpoint the stars of the game were Macintosh, Hoopes and H. Sangree; the former kicked. a fine goal from<br />\nplacement, Sangree scooped up Calkins' fumble and scored a touchdown, while Hoopes was the only Haverford man who could do anything at all with the Hopkins line.<br />\nThe first quarter was scoreless<br />\nand indecisive, with neither team<br />\nshowing much to be proud of.<br />\nOnce, indeed, the Black and Blue<br />\nworked the ball to within 10 yards<br />\nof the line, but the Quakers smothered all attempts at a further advance and took the ball on downs.<br />\nWith the second quarter, however,<br />\nHopkins really got going, and in<br />\neight plays Calkins had carried the<br />\npigskin over for the first score.<br />\nJones kicked goal.<br />\nHopkins then received a n d<br />\nstarted another drive, which ended with an intercepted pass, but<br />\nHaverford lost ground on a bad<br />\npass from center and then fumbled, Middleton recovering. The<br />\nhalf ended in a series of forwards<br />\nby both teams, without marked<br />\nsuccess for either.<br />\nThe third period brought hope<br />\nto the Pennsylvanian's rooters.<br />\nOn the first play Calkins went<br />\naround end and then lost the ball;<br />\nII Sangree picked it up and ran<br />\n<br />\n40 yards for a score. Following<br />\nthe kickoff Hopkins gained ground<br />\non a fumble recovered by Middleton, but was unable to advance;<br />\nCalkins then stepped back and<br />\nsent a 40-yard drop-kick between<br />\nthe bars. Not to be outdone, the<br />\nQuakers soon approached thp goal<br />\nand sent Macintosh into the game<br />\nto score from a placement kick,<br />\nthus knotting the count at 10 all.<br />\nThis seemed to put the final dash<br />\nof determination into the Hopkins<br />\nteam, for from then on the game<br />\nwas all their. Three consecutive<br />\nfirst downs and an intercepted<br />\npass took the ball to within 8<br />\nyards of the line, from which<br />\npoint a dash by Jones and a plunge<br />\nby Gregg put over the final marker. To the end of the game the<br />\nBlack and Blue continued to advance, only to lose their gains in<br />\nuncalled-for attempts at field<br />\ngoals.<br />\nWith the defeat of St. John's<br />\n<br />\nGuard-Mount and Review Will be Part<br />\nof Exercises at Presentation of<br />\nD.

After an<br />\nenthusiastic welcome which, he declared, was the best he had,received in Baltimore, the speaker<br />\ndelivered a plea for the- development of the aesthetic, the artistic<br />\nside of our national life, without<br />\nwhich, he holds, no country may<br />\nbe truly great.<br />\nScience and religion, he said,<br />\nare no more desirable and no more<br />\nessential to true happiness than<br />\nthe appreciation of the beautiful<br />\nin all its forms\u2014painting, sculpture, literature and the drama.<br />\nThe last 50 years have seen too<br />\nmuch emphasis placed on the material prosperity of the nation, the<br />\npresence of which seems to many<br />\nto show real greatness, which can<br />\nin reality come only through the<br />\ndevelopment(of the other side of<br />\nhuman life.<br />\nMr. Hampden believes that the<br />\ncultivation of the theater, an essentially democratic art, can do<br />\nmuch to bring this about. Through<br />\nthe drama we pierce the externals<br />\nof civilization and reach a more<br />\ncharming and inspiring atmosphere beyond; and in this no one<br />\nhas been more successful than<br />\nShakespeare, a man absolutely<br />\nmodern in thought, who belongs<br />\nto all people and all time. \"Hamlet,\" in particular, is a play which<br />\nis universal in its appeal, and<br />\nwhich can and does express something of the mind and feeling of<br />\nevery one. No actor may speak<br />\nof \"his Hamlet\"; all that he can<br />\ndo is to add something to the<br />\nstorehouse of information and interpretation from which his successors will draw.<br />\nThe speaker further declared<br />\nthat he made no special plea for<br />\nthe classics simply because they<br />\nwere old, but simply for the true<br />\nbeauty and truth to be found in<br />\nthem. He wants new and modern plays, but plays which are<br />\nreal and modern as Shakespeare<br />\nis real and modern, and which<br />\ntake up the work where the great<br />\nmen of former times left off. With<br />\nsuch an ideal in mind we may go<br />\nforward to the day when art will<br />\nreceive its due share of attention<br />\nand appreciation and we shall<br />\nrealize its necessity to true happiness.<br />\nPRESIDENT GOODNOW SAID:<br />\n\"I have always thought it a<br />\npity that the modern generations<br />\nknow so little about it (the Bible),<br />\ncertainly as compared with those<br />\nwho, in the days that are gone,<br />\ngave great attention to its study.\"<br />\nJOIN THE Y.

Lovejoy, professor<br />\nof philosophy at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nin the first of the series of public<br />\nlectures of the Social Science<br />\nClub, Thursday, proposed a plan<br />\nof profit-sharing on a 50-50 basis<br />\nfor both capital and labor as a<br />\nmeans of obtaining industrial<br />\npeace.<br />\nProfessor Lovejoy classified the<br />\nvarious profit-sharing plans into<br />\nthree distinct types. The first<br />\ntype, he said, was actuated by a<br />\ndesire on the part of capital to<br />\nincrease the income accruing to it;<br />\nthis he called profit-sharing for<br />\nprofit, or the illegitimate form of<br />\nprofit-sharing. The second type of<br />\nprofit-sharing he termed profitsharing for sharing in which both<br />\nemployer and wage-earners would<br />\nderive benefits from an increase in<br />\nprofits. The latter type was called<br />\nthe legitimate form of profit-sharing. The third type of profitsharing is that espoused by Dr.<br />\nLovejoy and bears the name of<br />\nprofit-halving.<br />\nProfessor Lovejoy describes his<br />\nplan as profit-sharing, not for the<br />\nsake of profits, but for the sake of<br />\nsharing. \"In the long run,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"it is true that it may turn<br />\nout to be profitable to all concerned; but it is not subject to the<br />\ninitial condition that its adoption<br />\nshall be to the pecuniary advantage of capital as well as labor.<br />\n\"It consists in a voluntary surrender by the present owners of<br />\nan enterprise of a substantial portion of any profit which may be<br />\nearned by it, not merely of a portion of the excess profits produced<br />\nby the sharing. If no increase of<br />\nearnings should result, the purpose<br />\nof this type of profit-sharing would<br />\nnot be defeated.\"<br />\nProfessor Lovejoy, however, is<br />\ndubious of the success of this plan.<br />\n\"It would entail,\" he said, \"too<br />\ngreat a sacrifice on the part of<br />\nthousands of stockholders whose<br />\nincomes would certainly be diminished for some time.\"<br />\n<br />\nHOCHSCHILD,KOHN &CO.<br />\nHoward and Lexington<br />\n<br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\nlj Besides the reputation of an old-established firm<br />\nis back of each sale with a guarantee.<br />\n<br />\nJOHN C.

The game was hardfought throughout, and devoted chiefly to old-style football, with a few<br />\nforward passes. From the first, Hopkins showed a decided advantage,<br />\nand was generally able to make substantial gains through the Quaker<br />\nline, although inside the 20-yard line the Niter played a wonderful<br />\ndefensive game. It's a matter of fact, the contest was more one-sided<br />\nthan the mere score indicates, for Hopkins made 11 first down to 4 for<br />\nHaverford, and in all probability might have had two more touchdowns if attempts for a field goal had not been made. The Black and<br />\nBlue also completed.four passes, while the Quakers worked only two of<br />\nmany attempts.<br />\nEvery man in the back field did his share in gaining ground, al'though Jones and Calkins were most successful in advancing the ball.<br />\nA notable improvement in defense against forward passes and in<br />\ntackling was seen, while time and again the Hopkins men broke through<br />\nand pulled down the Haverford runner for a loss. In the last period<br />\nnearly the whole Black and Blue line seemed to surge on and a dozen<br />\nhands catch an attempted pass that a moment later was turned into<br />\nthe winning touchdown. Middleton and the Wood brothers were<br />\nalways down the field under a kick, ready to drop the runner in his<br />\ntracks, and Middleton was right there in the third period to fall on a<br />\nfumbled ball, thus starting an advance that ended with a beautiful 40yard drop-kick by Calkins.<br />\nFrom the Haverford viewpoint the stars of the game were Macintosh, Hoopes and H. Sangree; the former kicked. a fine goal from<br />\nplacement, Sangree scooped up Calkins' fumble and scored a touchdown, while Hoopes was the only Haverford man who could do anything at all with the Hopkins line.<br />\nThe first quarter was scoreless<br />\nand indecisive, with neither team<br />\nshowing much to be proud of.<br />\nOnce, indeed, the Black and Blue<br />\nworked the ball to within 10 yards<br />\nof the line, but the Quakers smothered all attempts at a further advance and took the ball on downs.<br />\nWith the second quarter, however,<br />\nHopkins really got going, and in<br />\neight plays Calkins had carried the<br />\npigskin over for the first score.<br />\nJones kicked goal.<br />\nHopkins then received a n d<br />\nstarted another drive, which ended with an intercepted pass, but<br />\nHaverford lost ground on a bad<br />\npass from center and then fumbled, Middleton recovering. The<br />\nhalf ended in a series of forwards<br />\nby both teams, without marked<br />\nsuccess for either.<br />\nThe third period brought hope<br />\nto the Pennsylvanian's rooters.<br />\nOn the first play Calkins went<br />\naround end and then lost the ball;<br />\nII Sangree picked it up and ran<br /><br />\n40 yards for a score. Following<br />\nthe kickoff Hopkins gained ground<br />\non a fumble recovered by Middleton, but was unable to advance;<br />\nCalkins then stepped back and<br />\nsent a 40-yard drop-kick between<br />\nthe bars. Not to be outdone, the<br />\nQuakers soon approached thp goal<br />\nand sent Macintosh into the game<br />\nto score from a placement kick,<br />\nthus knotting the count at 10 all.<br />\nThis seemed to put the final dash<br />\nof determination into the Hopkins<br />\nteam, for from then on the game<br />\nwas all their. Three consecutive<br />\nfirst downs and an intercepted<br />\npass took the ball to within 8<br />\nyards of the line, from which<br />\npoint a dash by Jones and a plunge<br />\nby Gregg put over the final marker. To the end of the game the<br />\nBlack and Blue continued to advance, only to lose their gains in<br />\nuncalled-for attempts at field<br />\ngoals.<br />\nWith the defeat of St. John's<br /><br />\nGuard-Mount and Review Will be Part<br />\nof Exercises at Presentation of<br />\nD.

After an<br />\nenthusiastic welcome which, he declared, was the best he had,received in Baltimore, the speaker<br />\ndelivered a plea for the- development of the aesthetic, the artistic<br />\nside of our national life, without<br />\nwhich, he holds, no country may<br />\nbe truly great.<br />\nScience and religion, he said,<br />\nare no more desirable and no more<br />\nessential to true happiness than<br />\nthe appreciation of the beautiful<br />\nin all its forms\u2014painting, sculpture, literature and the drama.<br />\nThe last 50 years have seen too<br />\nmuch emphasis placed on the material prosperity of the nation, the<br />\npresence of which seems to many<br />\nto show real greatness, which can<br />\nin reality come only through the<br />\ndevelopment(of the other side of<br />\nhuman life.<br />\nMr. Hampden believes that the<br />\ncultivation of the theater, an essentially democratic art, can do<br />\nmuch to bring this about. Through<br />\nthe drama we pierce the externals<br />\nof civilization and reach a more<br />\ncharming and inspiring atmosphere beyond; and in this no one<br />\nhas been more successful than<br />\nShakespeare, a man absolutely<br />\nmodern in thought, who belongs<br />\nto all people and all time. \"Hamlet,\" in particular, is a play which<br />\nis universal in its appeal, and<br />\nwhich can and does express something of the mind and feeling of<br />\nevery one.

Lovejoy, professor<br />\nof philosophy at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nin the first of the series of public<br />\nlectures of the Social Science<br />\nClub, Thursday, proposed a plan<br />\nof profit-sharing on a 50-50 basis<br />\nfor both capital and labor as a<br />\nmeans of obtaining industrial<br />\npeace.<br />\nProfessor Lovejoy classified the<br />\nvarious profit-sharing plans into<br />\nthree distinct types. The first<br />\ntype, he said, was actuated by a<br />\ndesire on the part of capital to<br />\nincrease the income accruing to it;<br />\nthis he called profit-sharing for<br />\nprofit, or the illegitimate form of<br />\nprofit-sharing. The second type of<br />\nprofit-sharing he termed profitsharing for sharing in which both<br />\nemployer and wage-earners would<br />\nderive benefits from an increase in<br />\nprofits. The latter type was called<br />\nthe legitimate form of profit-sharing. The third type of profitsharing is that espoused by Dr.<br />\nLovejoy and bears the name of<br />\nprofit-halving.<br />\nProfessor Lovejoy describes his<br />\nplan as profit-sharing, not for the<br />\nsake of profits, but for the sake of<br />\nsharing. \"In the long run,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"it is true that it may turn<br />\nout to be profitable to all concerned; but it is not subject to the<br />\ninitial condition that its adoption<br />\nshall be to the pecuniary advantage of capital as well as labor.<br />\n\"It consists in a voluntary surrender by the present owners of<br />\nan enterprise of a substantial portion of any profit which may be<br />\nearned by it, not merely of a portion of the excess profits produced<br />\nby the sharing. If no increase of<br />\nearnings should result, the purpose<br />\nof this type of profit-sharing would<br />\nnot be defeated.\"<br />\nProfessor Lovejoy, however, is<br />\ndubious of the success of this plan.<br />\n\"It would entail,\" he said, \"too<br />\ngreat a sacrifice on the part of<br />\nthousands of stockholders whose<br />\nincomes would certainly be diminished for some time.\"<br /><br />\nHOCHSCHILD,KOHN &amp;CO.<br />\nHoward and Lexington<br /><br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\nlj Besides the reputation of an old-established firm<br />\nis back of each sale with a guarantee.<br /><br />\nJOHN C.
