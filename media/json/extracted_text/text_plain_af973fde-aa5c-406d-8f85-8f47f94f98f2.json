How little that means to the outside world, but how<br />\nmuch it means to the college man. To the uninformed public a banquet<br />\nmeans a period of gastronomic exercise and (for the last few years)<br />\na sorrowing of the past.<br />\nTo the college senior, the class banquet means his fond farewell<br />\nto four years of real joy; a last fling at collegiate celebration and a<br />\ndenunciation of the Volstead Act over his cups.<br />\nTo the Junior, banquet night means the first real crack at unrestrained pleasure, free from fears of a rival class attack.<br />\nTo the Sophomore and the Freshman the celebration calls for<br />\npitched battle and kidnapping of the rival class' officers.
