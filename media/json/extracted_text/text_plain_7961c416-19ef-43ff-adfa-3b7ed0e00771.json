If anything, it understated the<br />\nmagnitude of Hopkins' financial troubles by using<br />\ncomplicated statistics instead of accusations.<br />\nNevertheless, the report is a shocker.<br />\nIt shows that in a period when the University is losing<br />\n$5 million annually the Central Administration<br />\ntentatively plans to increase its budget next year by<br />\n$170,000. This might not seem too unreasonable unless<br />\none realizes that the Administration has tripled in the<br />\npast five years, and now gobbles up over 10 per cent of<br />\nthe University's total expenditures. And for all that<br />\nmoney (almost $9 million yearly), the report uncovered<br />\nan Administration in shambles: bogged down with too<br />\nmany programs, too many staffers and .not enough<br />\nexecutive control. For instance the report found that the<br />\nDevelopment Office, our supposed fund-raisers, has not<br />\nsufficiently accounted for hundreds of thousands of<br />\ndollars. In addition, the report counted 523 professional<br />\nand non-professional Administrative personnel on<br />\nHomewood campus, almost double the number of<br />\nfaculty here. And many of these workers seem free to do'<br />\nwhat they want, or don't want.<br />\nThe entire blame, though, should not be disdainfully<br />\nleveled at President Gordon. In most cases he inherited,<br />\nnot formulated, our decentralized and headstrong<br />\nAdministration. It would be self-defeating for faculty<br />\nmembers and students to demand a return to the<br />\nbenevolent and constricted despotism of the '50's.<br />\nHopkins has to develop an efficient and innovative<br />\nAdministration to keep on top of the rapid changes in<br />\nsociety and higher education.<br />\nBut to keep on top now, the Administration, especially<br />\nthe Central Administration, must adjust to the dismal<br />\nfacts of the '70's and cut back. Students have done their<br />\nbit by paying the constant tuition hikes. So has the<br />\nfaculty by weathering a ten per cent cutback. The<br />\nfinancial crisis requires, in Dr. Gordon's own words last<br />\nmonth, \"the best efforts of everyone concerned.\"<br />\n<br />\nFootball Folly<br />\nYesterday, the Boston Patriots made Stanford's Jim<br />\nPlunkett the first player chosen in the NFL draft of<br />\ncollege football talent, and they will probably have to<br />\nmake him a rich man if they want him to play for their<br />\nteam. This is what football has become in the United<br />\nStates. It is no longer a sport, no longer an avenue for<br />\nindividual accomplishment. It is a business, and it costs<br />\nmoney. This fact has been driven home here at Hopkins.<br />\nWe can no longer support a football team consistent with<br />\nthe athletic policy laid down several decades ago by Dr.<br />\nShaffer, within this highly competitive and expensive<br />\nenvironment. We cannot keep the best coach we've ever<br />\nhad without drumming up more support for his team, so<br />\nit is difficult to justify, in this time of financial austerity,<br />\nthe continuation of a necessarily mediocre program,<br />\nwhich would cost the University a great deal and be of<br />\nbenefit to only a few. It would be wiser for the Athletic<br />\ndepartment to concentrate its resources on the sports<br />\nthat still allow for the type of individual development<br />\nthat Dr. Shaffer had in mind.<br />\n<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nNO MORE DE KUYPER<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nBased on your recent<br />\narticle, re: an extant Fred De<br />\nKuyper<br />\nby<br />\nGreg<br />\nA.<br />\nTobolosky, I am switching to<br />\nHiram Walker Creme de<br />\nMenthe.<br />\nRight on!<br />\nA Creme de Menther<br />\n(Green)<br />\nMORE DE KUYPER<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was rather upset with the<br />\nshabby way you treated Fred<br />\nDe Kuyper.

The minimester<br />\nwas a small step towards<br />\nhealth, despite its numerous<br />\nflaws. I would like to propose<br />\na modification of the current<br />\neducational system, based<br />\nminimester<br />\nmy<br />\nupon<br />\nexperiences, and various<br />\nreadings. The main change<br />\nthat needs to be made is an<br />\nincrease in flexibility....<br />\nI believe that most lectures<br />\nare damaging to the lecturer,<br />\nthe students, and the subject<br />\nmatter. However, there are<br />\nthose who find that this type<br />\nof education suits their needs.<br />\nSuch students should be free<br />\nto attend lectures, as they<br />\ncurrently do. The classes<br />\nwould be smaller, because<br />\nof<br />\ntypes<br />\nalternative<br />\nbe<br />\nwould<br />\ninstruction<br />\navailable....<br />\nI think that most students<br />\nwould elect to take seminars.<br />\nthis<br />\nlearned<br />\nwas<br />\nIt<br />\nminimester that a class size<br />\nof five to ten members is most<br />\neffective.... Large lecture<br />\ncourses could be broken up<br />\ninto a number of seminars,<br />\nMichael Lerner is a sophomore<br />\n<br />\neach emphasizing a different<br />\naspect of the subject, thus<br />\ncreating truly individualized<br />\neducation. Interdisciplinary<br />\nsubjects that are not taught,<br />\npossibly because they appeal<br />\nto too few students, could be<br />\ncovered in small seminars....<br />\nGraduate students, faculty,<br />\nqualified undergraduates,<br />\nand persons outside the<br />\nuniversity, such as doctors,<br />\ncould act as instructors... One<br />\nwould hope that a sense of<br />\ncommunity wold develop as a<br />\nresult of this informal<br />\ncontact...<br />\nSeminars are a form of<br />\nactive learning,for all parties<br />\ninvolved.... During the<br />\nminimester, for example, I<br />\nnoticed that most people were<br />\ninterested in arguing, not<br />\nlearning. If the instructor is<br />\nskillful, the students will<br />\nlearn how to formulate ideas,<br />\ndefend them, and evaluate<br />\nand accommodate to others...<br />\nThe structure of the course<br />\nwould be determined by the<br />\ninstructor, who would base it<br />\non recommendations from<br />\nThrough<br />\nstudents.<br />\nthe<br />\nfeedback, courses would be<br />\ncontinually modified,<br />\n<br />\nallowing for some semblance<br />\nof democracy. The number of<br />\nmeetings per week, length of<br />\neach meeting, duration of the<br />\ncourse, type of grading and<br />\nrequirements would<br />\ntherefore vary from course to<br />\ncourse.... The instructor<br />\ncould adopt various roles,<br />\nfrom a mediator, to an equal,<br />\nto an observer, to a<br />\ncombination of all three....<br />\nThe final component of the<br />\nnew system would be<br />\nindependent projects. They<br />\nundertaken<br />\nbe<br />\ncould<br />\nindividually or in groups, and<br />\ncould range from readings to<br />\nresearch to field work....<br />\nI have merely outlined the<br />\nnew.<br />\nthis<br />\nskeleton<br />\nof<br />\nuniversity. Details can be<br />\nfilled in after a committment<br />\nto this type of change has<br />\nbeen made. The aim of the<br />\nyears spent at Hopkins should<br />\nbe to do what one wants to do,<br />\nbe it learning, having a good<br />\nsocial life, finding oneself,<br />\netc. Such goals involve whole<br />\npeople, and can't be reached<br />\nby the standard college<br />\neducation.

In faculty lounges across the<br />\ncountry this vexing question is causing much earnest discussion and<br />\nnot a few stabbings. Today, to help you find an answer, let me tell you<br />\nabout the Sigafoos brothers.<br />\nThe Sigafoos brothers were both professors at a famous Eastern<br />\nuniversity (Colorado School of Mines). Worsham, the elder brother,<br />\ntaught mica and feldspar. Hymie, the younger, taught shafting and<br />\nshoring. Worsham was a strict authoritarian who believed the best way<br />\nto teach was to stay aloof from his students, to be distant and forbidding. In Worsham's classes only he talked, nobody else. In fact, not<br />\nonly didn't he let his students talk to him, he didn't even let them look<br />\nat him. For years the kids had to fall full length on their bellies every<br />\ntime Worsham entered the classroom and stay that way until he left.<br />\nThe college finally forced him to stop last spring after a sophomore<br />\ncoed named Ethel R. Beinecke died from an overdose of floor wax.<br />\nAfter that Worsham just had the kids drop to one knee.<br />\n(Incidentally, speaking of dropping to one knee, it's a very ironic<br />\nlittle story, the story of how this custom began. As you know of course,<br />\nit started in Bavaria during the reign of Ludwig the Gimp (1608-1899)<br />\nwho, as you know of course, had one leg shorter than the other. To<br />\nkeep the king from feeling self-conscious, his subjects would always<br />\ndrop to one knee whenever he came gimping by. Indeed, they did such<br />\na convincing job that Ludwig lived all his life believing everybody had<br />\none short leg.<br />\n(Now here comes the ironic part: after his death it was discovered<br />\nthat Ludwig never had a short leg after all! Do you know what he had?<br />\nIle had his pants buttoned to his vest!) \u2022<br />\nBut I digress.'Worsham Sigafoos, I say, stayed aloof from his students. So what happened? The students grew steadily more cowed and<br />\nsullen, trauma and twitching set in, night sweats followed, and when it,<br />\ncame time for finals, every man jack of them flunked.<br />\nNow let us take Worsham's younger brother Hymie. Breezy,<br />\nbearded, twinkly, outgoing, dressed always in homespun robes and a<br />\nNavajo puberty pouch, Hymie was totally unlike his brother (except,<br />\nof course, that each had one short leg). Hymie believed the way to<br />\nteach was to be a pal to the students, not a despot. He let the kids<br />\ncome to class or not, whichever they liked. Classroom discussions were<br />\nfree and unstructured. Anyone who had anything to say simply spoke<br />\nup. Sometimes the class discussed classwork, but more often they just<br />\nsat and gassed about life in general or maybe played a little Show and<br />\nTell. (This was especially popular in spring when everybody brought<br />\ntheir Easter chicks to class.)<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY GLEE CLUB IS SCHEDULED TO<br />\nPERFORM TWO VERY OUTSTANDING CHORAL PIECES DURING<br />\nTHE SECOND SEMESTER WITH THE GOUCHER COLLEGE CLUB:<br />\n<br />\nSunday, March 14, 1971<br />\n4:00 p.m.<br />\nSunday, March 28, 1971<br />\n4:00 p.m.<br />\nSunday, May 2, 1971<br />\n8:30 p.m.<br />\n<br />\n\"Missa Brevis\" by Zoltan Kodaly<br />\nwith organ and soloists<br />\nSame as above at the St. Thomas<br />\nChurch, New York City<br />\n\"Carmina Burana\" by Carl Orff<br />\nwith soloists and large orchestra<br />\nAt Goucher College<br />\n<br />\nIS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT MANY OF THE HOPKINS<br />\nCOMMUNITY WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE<br />\nPERFORMANCES.

This, he said, plus<br />\nthe fact that no admission is<br />\ncharged to students, would<br />\nserve to nullify the argument<br />\nthat low attendance justifies<br />\nthe elimination of football.<br />\nSydnor expressed guarded<br />\noptimism about the retention<br />\nof football, placing his<br />\nappraisal of the odds as<br />\nslightly better than 50-50. He<br />\nmentioned that despite a<br />\ngeneral feeling among the<br />\nHopkins faculty to cut<br />\nfootball and to upgrade<br />\nsoccer competition rather<br />\n<br />\nthan football, the popularity<br />\nof football among alumni<br />\nmight_ influence the final<br />\ndecision of the administration.<br />\n<br />\nidentities of any of the<br />\napplicants, he did state 4 or 5<br />\nare especially qualified for<br />\nthe job.<br />\n<br />\nThe situation, however, is<br />\nby no means without<br />\nprecedent. Sydnor pointed to<br />\na strong push for cutbacks in<br />\nthe athletic budget in 1967,<br />\nand Turner noted that the<br />\nissue is one that has seemed<br />\nto surface every 2 or 3 years<br />\nthroughout his 25-year tenure<br />\nat the University.<br />\nMeanwhile, approximately<br />\n20-25 individuals have applied<br />\nto Turner for Sotir's position.<br />\nthe .

If anything, it understated the<br />\nmagnitude of Hopkins' financial troubles by using<br />\ncomplicated statistics instead of accusations.<br />\nNevertheless, the report is a shocker.<br />\nIt shows that in a period when the University is losing<br />\n$5 million annually the Central Administration<br />\ntentatively plans to increase its budget next year by<br />\n$170,000. This might not seem too unreasonable unless<br />\none realizes that the Administration has tripled in the<br />\npast five years, and now gobbles up over 10 per cent of<br />\nthe University's total expenditures. And for all that<br />\nmoney (almost $9 million yearly), the report uncovered<br />\nan Administration in shambles: bogged down with too<br />\nmany programs, too many staffers and .not enough<br />\nexecutive control. For instance the report found that the<br />\nDevelopment Office, our supposed fund-raisers, has not<br />\nsufficiently accounted for hundreds of thousands of<br />\ndollars. In addition, the report counted 523 professional<br />\nand non-professional Administrative personnel on<br />\nHomewood campus, almost double the number of<br />\nfaculty here. And many of these workers seem free to do'<br />\nwhat they want, or don't want.<br />\nThe entire blame, though, should not be disdainfully<br />\nleveled at President Gordon. In most cases he inherited,<br />\nnot formulated, our decentralized and headstrong<br />\nAdministration. It would be self-defeating for faculty<br />\nmembers and students to demand a return to the<br />\nbenevolent and constricted despotism of the '50's.<br />\nHopkins has to develop an efficient and innovative<br />\nAdministration to keep on top of the rapid changes in<br />\nsociety and higher education.<br />\nBut to keep on top now, the Administration, especially<br />\nthe Central Administration, must adjust to the dismal<br />\nfacts of the '70's and cut back. Students have done their<br />\nbit by paying the constant tuition hikes. So has the<br />\nfaculty by weathering a ten per cent cutback. The<br />\nfinancial crisis requires, in Dr. Gordon's own words last<br />\nmonth, \"the best efforts of everyone concerned.\"<br /><br />\nFootball Folly<br />\nYesterday, the Boston Patriots made Stanford's Jim<br />\nPlunkett the first player chosen in the NFL draft of<br />\ncollege football talent, and they will probably have to<br />\nmake him a rich man if they want him to play for their<br />\nteam. This is what football has become in the United<br />\nStates. It is no longer a sport, no longer an avenue for<br />\nindividual accomplishment. It is a business, and it costs<br />\nmoney. This fact has been driven home here at Hopkins.<br />\nWe can no longer support a football team consistent with<br />\nthe athletic policy laid down several decades ago by Dr.<br />\nShaffer, within this highly competitive and expensive<br />\nenvironment. We cannot keep the best coach we've ever<br />\nhad without drumming up more support for his team, so<br />\nit is difficult to justify, in this time of financial austerity,<br />\nthe continuation of a necessarily mediocre program,<br />\nwhich would cost the University a great deal and be of<br />\nbenefit to only a few. It would be wiser for the Athletic<br />\ndepartment to concentrate its resources on the sports<br />\nthat still allow for the type of individual development<br />\nthat Dr. Shaffer had in mind.<br /><br />\nthe Editors<br />\nNO MORE DE KUYPER<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nBased on your recent<br />\narticle, re: an extant Fred De<br />\nKuyper<br />\nby<br />\nGreg<br />\nA.<br />\nTobolosky, I am switching to<br />\nHiram Walker Creme de<br />\nMenthe.<br />\nRight on!<br />\nA Creme de Menther<br />\n(Green)<br />\nMORE DE KUYPER<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was rather upset with the<br />\nshabby way you treated Fred<br />\nDe Kuyper.

The minimester<br />\nwas a small step towards<br />\nhealth, despite its numerous<br />\nflaws. I would like to propose<br />\na modification of the current<br />\neducational system, based<br />\nminimester<br />\nmy<br />\nupon<br />\nexperiences, and various<br />\nreadings. The main change<br />\nthat needs to be made is an<br />\nincrease in flexibility....<br />\nI believe that most lectures<br />\nare damaging to the lecturer,<br />\nthe students, and the subject<br />\nmatter. However, there are<br />\nthose who find that this type<br />\nof education suits their needs.<br />\nSuch students should be free<br />\nto attend lectures, as they<br />\ncurrently do. The classes<br />\nwould be smaller, because<br />\nof<br />\ntypes<br />\nalternative<br />\nbe<br />\nwould<br />\ninstruction<br />\navailable....<br />\nI think that most students<br />\nwould elect to take seminars.<br />\nthis<br />\nlearned<br />\nwas<br />\nIt<br />\nminimester that a class size<br />\nof five to ten members is most<br />\neffective.... Large lecture<br />\ncourses could be broken up<br />\ninto a number of seminars,<br />\nMichael Lerner is a sophomore<br /><br />\neach emphasizing a different<br />\naspect of the subject, thus<br />\ncreating truly individualized<br />\neducation. Interdisciplinary<br />\nsubjects that are not taught,<br />\npossibly because they appeal<br />\nto too few students, could be<br />\ncovered in small seminars....<br />\nGraduate students, faculty,<br />\nqualified undergraduates,<br />\nand persons outside the<br />\nuniversity, such as doctors,<br />\ncould act as instructors... One<br />\nwould hope that a sense of<br />\ncommunity wold develop as a<br />\nresult of this informal<br />\ncontact...<br />\nSeminars are a form of<br />\nactive learning,for all parties<br />\ninvolved.... During the<br />\nminimester, for example, I<br />\nnoticed that most people were<br />\ninterested in arguing, not<br />\nlearning. If the instructor is<br />\nskillful, the students will<br />\nlearn how to formulate ideas,<br />\ndefend them, and evaluate<br />\nand accommodate to others...<br />\nThe structure of the course<br />\nwould be determined by the<br />\ninstructor, who would base it<br />\non recommendations from<br />\nThrough<br />\nstudents.<br />\nthe<br />\nfeedback, courses would be<br />\ncontinually modified,<br /><br />\nallowing for some semblance<br />\nof democracy. The number of<br />\nmeetings per week, length of<br />\neach meeting, duration of the<br />\ncourse, type of grading and<br />\nrequirements would<br />\ntherefore vary from course to<br />\ncourse.... The instructor<br />\ncould adopt various roles,<br />\nfrom a mediator, to an equal,<br />\nto an observer, to a<br />\ncombination of all three....<br />\nThe final component of the<br />\nnew system would be<br />\nindependent projects. They<br />\nundertaken<br />\nbe<br />\ncould<br />\nindividually or in groups, and<br />\ncould range from readings to<br />\nresearch to field work....<br />\nI have merely outlined the<br />\nnew.<br />\nthis<br />\nskeleton<br />\nof<br />\nuniversity. Details can be<br />\nfilled in after a committment<br />\nto this type of change has<br />\nbeen made. The aim of the<br />\nyears spent at Hopkins should<br />\nbe to do what one wants to do,<br />\nbe it learning, having a good<br />\nsocial life, finding oneself,<br />\netc. Such goals involve whole<br />\npeople, and can't be reached<br />\nby the standard college<br />\neducation.

In faculty lounges across the<br />\ncountry this vexing question is causing much earnest discussion and<br />\nnot a few stabbings. Today, to help you find an answer, let me tell you<br />\nabout the Sigafoos brothers.<br />\nThe Sigafoos brothers were both professors at a famous Eastern<br />\nuniversity (Colorado School of Mines). Worsham, the elder brother,<br />\ntaught mica and feldspar. Hymie, the younger, taught shafting and<br />\nshoring. Worsham was a strict authoritarian who believed the best way<br />\nto teach was to stay aloof from his students, to be distant and forbidding. In Worsham's classes only he talked, nobody else. In fact, not<br />\nonly didn't he let his students talk to him, he didn't even let them look<br />\nat him. For years the kids had to fall full length on their bellies every<br />\ntime Worsham entered the classroom and stay that way until he left.<br />\nThe college finally forced him to stop last spring after a sophomore<br />\ncoed named Ethel R. Beinecke died from an overdose of floor wax.<br />\nAfter that Worsham just had the kids drop to one knee.<br />\n(Incidentally, speaking of dropping to one knee, it's a very ironic<br />\nlittle story, the story of how this custom began. As you know of course,<br />\nit started in Bavaria during the reign of Ludwig the Gimp (1608-1899)<br />\nwho, as you know of course, had one leg shorter than the other. To<br />\nkeep the king from feeling self-conscious, his subjects would always<br />\ndrop to one knee whenever he came gimping by. Indeed, they did such<br />\na convincing job that Ludwig lived all his life believing everybody had<br />\none short leg.<br />\n(Now here comes the ironic part: after his death it was discovered<br />\nthat Ludwig never had a short leg after all! Do you know what he had?<br />\nIle had his pants buttoned to his vest!) \u2022<br />\nBut I digress.'Worsham Sigafoos, I say, stayed aloof from his students. So what happened? The students grew steadily more cowed and<br />\nsullen, trauma and twitching set in, night sweats followed, and when it,<br />\ncame time for finals, every man jack of them flunked.<br />\nNow let us take Worsham's younger brother Hymie. Breezy,<br />\nbearded, twinkly, outgoing, dressed always in homespun robes and a<br />\nNavajo puberty pouch, Hymie was totally unlike his brother (except,<br />\nof course, that each had one short leg). Hymie believed the way to<br />\nteach was to be a pal to the students, not a despot. He let the kids<br />\ncome to class or not, whichever they liked. Classroom discussions were<br />\nfree and unstructured. Anyone who had anything to say simply spoke<br />\nup. Sometimes the class discussed classwork, but more often they just<br />\nsat and gassed about life in general or maybe played a little Show and<br />\nTell. (This was especially popular in spring when everybody brought<br />\ntheir Easter chicks to class.)<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY GLEE CLUB IS SCHEDULED TO<br />\nPERFORM TWO VERY OUTSTANDING CHORAL PIECES DURING<br />\nTHE SECOND SEMESTER WITH THE GOUCHER COLLEGE CLUB:<br /><br />\nSunday, March 14, 1971<br />\n4:00 p.m.<br />\nSunday, March 28, 1971<br />\n4:00 p.m.<br />\nSunday, May 2, 1971<br />\n8:30 p.m.<br /><br />\n\"Missa Brevis\" by Zoltan Kodaly<br />\nwith organ and soloists<br />\nSame as above at the St. Thomas<br />\nChurch, New York City<br />\n\"Carmina Burana\" by Carl Orff<br />\nwith soloists and large orchestra<br />\nAt Goucher College<br /><br />\nIS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT MANY OF THE HOPKINS<br />\nCOMMUNITY WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE<br />\nPERFORMANCES.
