Eisenhower Library. And while the building<br />\nstands proud and statuesque, its patrons have been reduced to the status of pawns. The efficiency of the new<br />\nlibrary system borders on the inhuman. Our mugshots<br />\nare taken with our books and are known as mere numbers. We are counted as we enter the building and searched when we leave.<br />\nPaintings and drawings are exhibited in the upper<br />\nhall of the library, but the immensity of the hail makes<br />\nthe works virtually unnoticeable. On the lower levels<br />\nwhere there were once displayed lithographs the walls<br />\nare now barren with but a few busts of professors faces<br />\nturned to the wall. The long corridors on the lower<br />\nlevel remain unbroken, but for the color changes of the<br />\nstacks.<br />\nOn some levels it appears that the walls anti windows<br />\nare in sad disrepair, and in need of cleaning.<br />\nThe new efficiency dictates that no students from<br />\nother colleges should he permitted below the first level,<br />\nand not permitted in the library at all after 4:00 p.m.<br />\nThis policy seems entirely unwarranted, and merely<br />\nhelps to isolate Hopkins from the other college communities. There has always been a dirth of communications among the colleges in Baltimore, but this action<br />\ncan only serve to aggravate a situation that is already<br />\nworse that it should be. This policy should be reversed.<br />\nWhile the library was never designed with humans in<br />\nmind it would be worthwhile for the library staff to consider making the library fit for humans. If the walls of<br />\nthe library are to be sterile they should at least be clean,<br />\nbut better the walls should he covered with paintings,<br />\nprints or lithographs. Then maybe there would he no<br />\nneed to hide the lower levels of the library.<br />\n<br />\nSix of One Plus Half a<br />\nDozen of the Other<br />\nIt has come to our attention that the vacations at<br />\nHopkins are entirely too short and that it would definitely behoove the University to seriously consider an<br />\nextension of the two major academic respites that occur<br />\nduring the year. If it is a policy of the university to<br />\neffect a greater geographic distribution among the undergraduates, it is a necessity that such action he taken. At<br />\npresent Christmas vacation is a mear 20,160 minutes, and<br />\neven less for those students obligated to Saturday labs.<br />\nWhile this period at first glance seems adequate to effeclively,reconstitute the academic resources of the student,<br />\na second look reveals that for students travelling great distances the vacation is reduced to a palsied mere halt in<br />\ntheir academic endeavors. A student forced to drive to<br />\nthe coast for his Christmas vacation will consume approximately 6,340 hours of his time in transit\u2014not to<br />\ncount rest stop, gasoline stops, and so forth. Travel<br />\nSo the exotic midweot will consume 4,123 hours.<br />\nOf course one might insist that there are other more<br />\nrapid forms of transportation\u2014such as airplanes. This<br />\nconsideration is quite sordid, however, in view of air<br />\ncost, the increase in tuition and living coots\u2014not to<br />\nmention the general insecurity of air flight.<br />\nWe therefore propose in this period of computerization of the student hotly, that a few numbers be removed from student i.d. cards and relegated to the extension of vacation periods.

But they are Negro,<br />\nwhich suggests, on a purely<br />\nimagist level, blackness; and<br />\nthey are women. Before the first<br />\nscene, the film has established<br />\nItself as a portrayal of a perverted God. Secondly, Dr. Goldfoot is said repeatedly to have<br />\nraised his assistant\u2014Igor\u2014from<br />\nthe grave. Reminiscent is it not,<br />\nof the resurrection of Lazarus by<br />\nJesus. Thirdly, there is the existence of Dr. Goldfoot's twelve<br />\nbtkini'd<br />\ngirls, seemingly an<br />\narbitrary number, until we remember that Christ had twelve<br />\ndisciples.<br />\n<br />\nThere are also evidences of<br />\nDr. Goldfoot's relation to Christ<br />\nInherent in the scene structure<br />\nand spacial composition of the<br />\nfilm. In the final scenes, Dr.<br />\nGoldfoot is chasing the two<br />\nyoung men who wish to escape<br />\nhis power. The motion in this sequence is entirely downward\u2014<br />\ndown steep hills in a streetcar,<br />\ndownward in a car, a motorcycle.<br />\nDown. Christ is forced to descend to earth to capture the<br />\nsouls of men. And the sequence<br />\nhas its climax in Dr. Goldfoot's<br />\ndeath, his car falling off a high<br />\ncliff, an exotic red cloud freed<br />\nfrom the destroyed car. Crucifixion is the culmination of the<br />\ndownward path. . . But then<br />\nwhat happens? The very next<br />\nscene is of a huge jet plane,<br />\nrising powerfully into the sky.<br />\nThere is then a shot of the two<br />\nyoung men inside the plane,<br />\nlaughing coarsely--thinking they<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, DECEMBER I, 1965<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nhave destroyed Dr. Goldfoot and<br />\nthereby freed themselves. Next<br />\nshot: Dr. Goldfoot (\"Goldfoot\"<br />\n\u2014God's Fate?) appears at the<br />\ncabin door\u2014he is pilot. They are<br />\nsoaring upward with him. He is<br />\nresurrected and through him,<br />\nthey approach heaven. Man's<br />\nsoul is finally captured.<br />\nFor all its wit and sight-gags,<br />\nthis is a pessimistic film. Had its<br />\nstory been told in ancient Israel,<br />\nIt would have been a film of<br />\nreligious epiphany; of an omnipotent being affecting deeply,<br />\nthrough spiritual revelation, the<br />\nlives of men. But we live in<br />\nAmerica, in a time when man<br />\nhas neglected the right to rule<br />\nhis own soul, all his energy given<br />\ntoward the acquisition of money<br />\nand glory. Our Christ cannot be<br />\nthe son of God; we are impervious to a Christ representing<br />\ncharity and humility and selfrespect.<br />\n<br />\nBy<br />\n<br />\nMARSHALL PAUL<br />\nSports Editor<br />\nCoach Henry Ciccarone's \"new<br />\nlook\" may not be a Bill Russell<br />\non the boards or a Bob Cousey<br />\non the outside, but the Hopkins<br />\nteam which takes the floor tomorrow night figures to be the<br />\ntoughest, most aggressive cage<br />\nteam that Homewood has seen<br />\nin years.<br />\nThe backbone of this contingent is the freshman five that<br />\nopened the eyes of the school<br />\nlast year.

Eisenhower Library. And while the building<br />\nstands proud and statuesque, its patrons have been reduced to the status of pawns. The efficiency of the new<br />\nlibrary system borders on the inhuman. Our mugshots<br />\nare taken with our books and are known as mere numbers. We are counted as we enter the building and searched when we leave.<br />\nPaintings and drawings are exhibited in the upper<br />\nhall of the library, but the immensity of the hail makes<br />\nthe works virtually unnoticeable. On the lower levels<br />\nwhere there were once displayed lithographs the walls<br />\nare now barren with but a few busts of professors faces<br />\nturned to the wall. The long corridors on the lower<br />\nlevel remain unbroken, but for the color changes of the<br />\nstacks.<br />\nOn some levels it appears that the walls anti windows<br />\nare in sad disrepair, and in need of cleaning.<br />\nThe new efficiency dictates that no students from<br />\nother colleges should he permitted below the first level,<br />\nand not permitted in the library at all after 4:00 p.m.<br />\nThis policy seems entirely unwarranted, and merely<br />\nhelps to isolate Hopkins from the other college communities. There has always been a dirth of communications among the colleges in Baltimore, but this action<br />\ncan only serve to aggravate a situation that is already<br />\nworse that it should be. This policy should be reversed.<br />\nWhile the library was never designed with humans in<br />\nmind it would be worthwhile for the library staff to consider making the library fit for humans. If the walls of<br />\nthe library are to be sterile they should at least be clean,<br />\nbut better the walls should he covered with paintings,<br />\nprints or lithographs. Then maybe there would he no<br />\nneed to hide the lower levels of the library.<br /><br />\nSix of One Plus Half a<br />\nDozen of the Other<br />\nIt has come to our attention that the vacations at<br />\nHopkins are entirely too short and that it would definitely behoove the University to seriously consider an<br />\nextension of the two major academic respites that occur<br />\nduring the year. If it is a policy of the university to<br />\neffect a greater geographic distribution among the undergraduates, it is a necessity that such action he taken. At<br />\npresent Christmas vacation is a mear 20,160 minutes, and<br />\neven less for those students obligated to Saturday labs.<br />\nWhile this period at first glance seems adequate to effeclively,reconstitute the academic resources of the student,<br />\na second look reveals that for students travelling great distances the vacation is reduced to a palsied mere halt in<br />\ntheir academic endeavors. A student forced to drive to<br />\nthe coast for his Christmas vacation will consume approximately 6,340 hours of his time in transit\u2014not to<br />\ncount rest stop, gasoline stops, and so forth. Travel<br />\nSo the exotic midweot will consume 4,123 hours.<br />\nOf course one might insist that there are other more<br />\nrapid forms of transportation\u2014such as airplanes. This<br />\nconsideration is quite sordid, however, in view of air<br />\ncost, the increase in tuition and living coots\u2014not to<br />\nmention the general insecurity of air flight.<br />\nWe therefore propose in this period of computerization of the student hotly, that a few numbers be removed from student i.d. cards and relegated to the extension of vacation periods.

First, the title song\u2014it<br />\nls sung by the Supremes. Why,<br />\ntheir name alone suggests the<br />\nposition Dr. Goldfoot enjoys<br />\nin the film's cosmology. Besides,<br />\nthere are three Supremes-Diane, Mary and Florence\u2014almost forcing us to consider the<br />\nTrinity. But they are Negro,<br />\nwhich suggests, on a purely<br />\nimagist level, blackness; and<br />\nthey are women. Before the first<br />\nscene, the film has established<br />\nItself as a portrayal of a perverted God. Secondly, Dr. Goldfoot is said repeatedly to have<br />\nraised his assistant\u2014Igor\u2014from<br />\nthe grave. Reminiscent is it not,<br />\nof the resurrection of Lazarus by<br />\nJesus. Thirdly, there is the existence of Dr. Goldfoot's twelve<br />\nbtkini'd<br />\ngirls, seemingly an<br />\narbitrary number, until we remember that Christ had twelve<br />\ndisciples.<br /><br />\nThere are also evidences of<br />\nDr. Goldfoot's relation to Christ<br />\nInherent in the scene structure<br />\nand spacial composition of the<br />\nfilm. In the final scenes, Dr.<br />\nGoldfoot is chasing the two<br />\nyoung men who wish to escape<br />\nhis power. The motion in this sequence is entirely downward\u2014<br />\ndown steep hills in a streetcar,<br />\ndownward in a car, a motorcycle.<br />\nDown. Christ is forced to descend to earth to capture the<br />\nsouls of men. And the sequence<br />\nhas its climax in Dr. Goldfoot's<br />\ndeath, his car falling off a high<br />\ncliff, an exotic red cloud freed<br />\nfrom the destroyed car. Crucifixion is the culmination of the<br />\ndownward path. . . But then<br />\nwhat happens? The very next<br />\nscene is of a huge jet plane,<br />\nrising powerfully into the sky.<br />\nThere is then a shot of the two<br />\nyoung men inside the plane,<br />\nlaughing coarsely--thinking they<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, DECEMBER I, 1965<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nhave destroyed Dr. Goldfoot and<br />\nthereby freed themselves.

He is<br />\nresurrected and through him,<br />\nthey approach heaven. Man's<br />\nsoul is finally captured.<br />\nFor all its wit and sight-gags,<br />\nthis is a pessimistic film. Had its<br />\nstory been told in ancient Israel,<br />\nIt would have been a film of<br />\nreligious epiphany; of an omnipotent being affecting deeply,<br />\nthrough spiritual revelation, the<br />\nlives of men. But we live in<br />\nAmerica, in a time when man<br />\nhas neglected the right to rule<br />\nhis own soul, all his energy given<br />\ntoward the acquisition of money<br />\nand glory.
