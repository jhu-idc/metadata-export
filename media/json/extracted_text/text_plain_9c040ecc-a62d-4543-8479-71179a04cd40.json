The amenities that<br />\nare presently under consideration, although nothing is<br />\ndefinite at this stage, include<br />\nthe possibility of a mediumsized theater for the performing<br />\narts, a passageway connecting<br />\nLevering Hall with Gilman<br />\nHall, a larger bookstore, post<br />\noffice, and bank and the construction of new dorms or<br />\nrenovation of older buildings.<br />\n\"We haven't come to that<br />\ncrossroads yet,\" stated Welch<br />\nwhen asked about the possibility of new dorms.\"We are still<br />\nexploring the advantages and<br />\ndisadvantages going with the<br />\nnew dorm route versus<br />\nrenovating already existing<br />\nbuildings, which include<br />\nMcCoy, Wolman, Bradford,<br />\nRogers, and the Homewood<br />\nApartments.\"<br />\nWelch hopes that the possible renovation will not inconvenience any students. \"It would<br />\nbe our responsibility to make<br />\nsure that we had located in<br />\nCharles Village or somewhere<br />\nreasonably close by, within<br />\nwalking distance, an appropriate amount of space to<br />\ntake care of the dislocated<br />\nstudents if we were to renovate.<br />\n\"I would like to see far more<br />\nhousing opportunities than currently exist at the campus.

Some of the<br />\n(many)screw-ups involved might be excused; taken together, they paint a sorry<br />\npicture of the university administration.<br />\nThe phones were installed this summer. Unlike past years, there is now a<br />\nphone in every dorm room, and they are<br />\nconnected to the university system. The<br />\nidea in installing the phones was to increase security. Since students who<br />\nwanted to visit the freshmen would now<br />\nbe able to call any room, the theory<br />\n-went, there would be no reason to leave<br />\nthe outside doors open.<br />\nApparently things didn't work out<br />\nquite so nicely. The testimony of both<br />\nfreshmen and housemasters is that the<br />\ndoors are still left open, meaning that the<br />\ninstallation of the new system was a<br />\nwaste of time. But even accepting the<br />\nphones as a fait accompli, all sorts of<br />\nproblems have now arisen\u2014all of which<br />\nshould have been avoided.<br />\nTo begin with, when the freshmen got<br />\ntheir first phone bill recently, almost<br />\neveryone noticed that the charges seemed too high\u2014way too high. As it turned<br />\nout, the bills had been calculated at an<br />\nincorrect rate. Essentially, evening and<br />\nnight discounts(of great importance considering that the latter is 60 percent of<br />\n<br />\nthe normal rate) hadn't been figured in.<br />\nArthur Heigl, director of Administrative<br />\nComputing and the man responsible for<br />\nthe bills, says all of this was due to \"an<br />\nerror in the computer program.\" Now<br />\nthe bills are being recalculated.<br />\nBut there are also all sorts of other<br />\nproblems. The freshmen were never told,<br />\nfor example, what rates they would be<br />\ncharged. Even now, Heigl doesn't seem<br />\nsure a rate sheet can be developed. Passing the buck, he says AT&T is being<br />\n\"uncooperative.\" But the university<br />\nagreed to pay for AT&T's services. Did<br />\nit do so without knowing what rates<br />\nwould be charged? If so, this is a case<br />\nnot only of incompetence but of flagrant<br />\nirresponsibility. The new system also<br />\ncharges students for long-distance calls<br />\nwhich go unanswered. Couldn't someone<br />\nhave at least told the freshmen that? And<br />\nwhy are the first phone bills being<br />\ndistributed now, four months after the<br />\nsemester began?<br />\nThe whole thing reeks of massive<br />\nblundering. Time and again mistakes<br />\nhave been made\u2014mistakes which could<br />\nhave cost students money, and which certainly cost them headaches. Bettye<br />\nMiller, the director of Auxiliary Services,<br />\nsays the administration is \"satisfied\"<br />\nwith its telephone service. If so, it has a<br />\nsingularly peculiar definition of<br />\n\"satisfaction.\"<br />\n<br />\nA Boring Semester<br />\nNobody ever accused Hopkins of being the most exciting school in the world,<br />\nbut even by this place's standards, this<br />\npast semester has to rank as one of the<br />\nmost boring ever.<br />\nThings started off fairly well. When<br />\nstudents returned in September, it appeared the summer had seen some important developments: a Fall Break had<br />\nbeen slipped into the university calendar;<br />\na General Manager for WJHU had been<br />\nappointed; Robert Welch had been appointed as Homewood's newest dean.<br />\nAll of that led most people around<br />\ncampus to expect an interesting fall. It<br />\nhasn't turned out that way. There have,<br />\nit is true, been a few things the university's central administration got excited<br />\nabout\u2014a new suburban campus, a fight<br />\nwith the community about expanding into Wyman Park, a major new building<br />\nproject\u2014but by and large these aren't<br />\nthings undergraduates have much to do<br />\nwith.<br />\nAnd at a level where students do have<br />\ninfluence, not much has happened. The<br />\nBlack Student Union tried to stir up a little activity by organizing a day of protest against apartheid, but that fizzled.<br />\nThis newspaper prominently reported the<br />\nuniversity's heavy involvement in the<br />\npresident's \"Star Wars\" program, but<br />\nnobody seemed to care much about that.<br />\nIt came to light that the dormitory meal<br />\nplan suffers from a ridiculous pricin<br />\n<br />\nwas precious little protest voiced there<br />\neither.<br />\nNor have there been the usual<br />\nacrimonious brouhahas between groups<br />\nof students. There has been no TEP<br />\nnewsletter, nobody has tried to change<br />\nthe Student Council's constitution and<br />\nthe Chairman of the Elections Commission hasn't thrown a childish tantrum at<br />\na public meeting. (We have to admit<br />\nthese sorts of things aren't really<br />\ndesirable, but at least they do make the<br />\nplace more lively.)<br />\nWhy the dull semester? There are a<br />\nvariety of reasons. For one thing, the<br />\ncampus simply doesn't have as many<br />\ndynamic personalities as it used to. It's<br />\nalso true the Student Council, choosing<br />\nto focus on increasing student services<br />\n(e.g., the McShuttle), has done little to<br />\ndevelop major issues. And the<br />\nadministration\u2014content in mediocrity as<br />\nusual\u2014has tried no fast ones like closing the Hut. Surely the major reason,<br />\nthough, is good 'ole Hopkins apathy. As<br />\nusual, students around here have been<br />\nperfectly happy to ignore everything but<br />\ntheir books.<br />\nWhatever the reason for the boredom<br />\nof the fall, let's hope next semester brings<br />\na few surprises. We doubt Hopkins<br />\nstudents can manage to shake off their<br />\nlethargy between now and January, but<br />\nat least the holidays are the right time for<br />\nmiracles<br />\n<br />\nfl/lrf 1 14;Abrittelti trrilrefN StiRifflitiWitt:t4leet el 4/4)R<br />\n...ma<br />\n<br />\nr\u2022-<br />\n<br />\n1111in\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAfter reading last week's<br />\neditorial by Scott Proestel,<br />\n\"The Humanities 500: A<br />\nWandering Race,\" I was<br />\nwondering whether he has ever<br />\nactually taken any of the<br />\nHumanities courses here at<br />\nHopkins. As a Humanities major I can't tell you how much<br />\nI resented his patronizing attitude. Far be it from me, a<br />\nmere Humanities major who is<br />\nunable to extrapolate at length<br />\non the virtues of sine waves, to<br />\ncontradict Proestel, but I do<br />\nnot find my courseload wandering, lackadaisical or inanely<br />\nslow. I resent being characterized as having only to write a<br />\ntwo-page paper and possibly<br />\ntake a multiple choice test\u2014<br />\nespecially when I have pulled<br />\nmore than a few all-nighters<br />\ntrying to get three, four or five<br />\n(not two) page papers done<br />\neach week, in addition to<br />\nreading several lengthy books in<br />\nbetween papers. Afterwards,<br />\nmost unfortunately, I did not<br />\nget to spend the remaining part<br />\nof the week sleeping as Proestel<br />\nsuggests, since several days a<br />\nweek I have classes straight<br />\nthrough from nine until three.<br />\nI would also like to address<br />\nthe comment made about the<br />\nsimilarity of the hallways in<br />\nGilman Hall. Of what<br />\nsignificance is this statement?<br />\nAre the halls in 'science' or<br />\n'math' buildings such as<br />\nMaryland and Rowland Halls,<br />\nthat wildly exciting? Give me a<br />\nbreak.<br />\n<br />\nIn closing, I would just like<br />\nto add that I do not smoke,<br />\nhang Oriental rugs on my walls<br />\nor have any interest whatsoever<br />\nin the ramifications of Greek<br />\nart upon Polish sexuality,<br />\nalthough I do know a few<br />\nscience and math majors who<br />\nfit the above description pretty<br />\nwell. I hope in the future Proestel will refrain from<br />\nstereotyping people and making<br />\nwild generalizations about areas<br />\nin which he appears to have<br />\nvery little knowledge.<br />\nHeather Green<br />\n<br />\n...& A Rebuttal<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nBeing a nonconformist in at<br />\nleast a couple of respects, I<br />\nthought I would provide my<br />\nrebuttal to the attacks of<br />\nhumanities majors that might<br />\nensue after my article,<br />\n\"Humanities 500: A Wandering Race,\" printed in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter.

All of the<br />\nmembers of the Peabody cast<br />\nseemed quite comfortable on<br />\nstage, especially Pedrillo,<br />\nBelmonte's comic servant, who<br />\ngracefully dealt with sometimes<br />\nuncooperative props.<br />\nCompleting the performance<br />\nwere the costumes and<br />\nscenery\u2014important in opera<br />\nperformance\u2014lavish and vivid,<br />\nrespectively. Who could not<br />\nwish to don the rich clothing of<br />\na Spanish nobleman or the accouterments of a Spanish Lady<br />\nand traipse through the exotic<br />\nworld of an Eastern palace?<br />\nThe professional quality of<br />\nthe Peabody Opera Theater is<br />\nmanifest. From the artistic<br />\ndirection to the music direction<br />\nto the stage direction to the<br />\ncostume and set design, the performance of The Abduction deserves acclaim. Bravo<br />\ncompany!

This<br />\nmysterious, restless music contains a multiplicity of melodies<br />\nwhich result not in dissonance,<br />\nbut in a fugue of staggering<br />\ncomplexity. The second movement also presents this plentitude of melodic motives in the<br />\nupper strings, but they are suppressed by gruff assertions<br />\nfrom the lower instruments.<br />\nThe almost wholly contrapuntal third movement was,<br />\nas the first two were, masterfully executed by the ensemble. In<br />\none section a heated duel<br />\nbreaks out between the strings,<br />\nand the group embraced this<br />\nopportunity to further heighten<br />\nthe energetic tension of the<br />\nwork.<br />\nIn the fourth movement, the<br />\npolyphonic treatment was once<br />\nagain emphasized as all of the<br />\ninstruments became \"soloists.\"<br />\nOften two or more would play<br />\na short tutti section, but the<br />\ngroupings were so dynamic that<br />\nfor two bars the violin would<br />\nmatch clarinet and the next to<br />\nthe French horn double bass.<br />\nA bright fifth movement<br />\nwith dances rounded out this<br />\npiece which the composer felt<br />\nto be a \"useful piece.\" Many<br />\ncritics, however, consider<br />\nHindemith to be the first composer since Schubert to achieve<br />\na more-than-quartet piece<br />\nwhich did not tax its listeners.<br />\nThroughout the performance, the Orpheus ensemble<br />\nplayed with precision, lucidity,<br />\nmusical virtousity.

No wonder<br />\nyou're such a monster. You had<br />\nto brave that toilet seat which<br />\novernight sucks cold air out of<br />\neverywhere. Then, infinitely<br />\nworse, you had to face the<br />\nmedicine cabinet\u2014first the<br />\ndreadful sight in the mirror,<br />\nthen the horrors on the shelves<br />\ninside. These days a woman<br />\ncan't trust her medicine<br />\ncabinet: in one corner, you<br />\nspied a bottle of Thalidomide,<br />\nin another, a box of Rely tampons. Then in the center you've<br />\ngot a little package for your<br />\nI.U.D. and it's a Dalkon<br />\nShield. You should have 1)slipped on the tiles and died a<br />\npainless death 2) gone straight<br />\nback to bed. Next time, opt for<br />\nthe second, but first here's a<br />\nbedtime story\u2014nightmares<br />\nguaranteed.<br />\nAt Any Cost is an extensive<br />\nreport On the Dalkon Shield by<br />\naward winning Washington<br />\nPost journalist Morton Mintz.<br />\nYou may start out not knowing<br />\nor caring what the Dalkon<br />\nShield is, but Mintz will quickly grab you and force you to<br />\nreact\u2014perhaps with shock,<br />\nanger, or disbelief\u2014but never<br />\nwith indifference. From page<br />\none, the multitude of sinister<br />\nand horribly depressing facts<br />\nand statistics he's gathered and<br />\nartfully pulled together with his<br />\nmatter-of-fact style will keep<br />\nyou wanting to know more. At<br />\nAny Cost is suspense, drama,<br />\nmystery and high tragedy\u2014<br />\nunfortunately, it's all true.<br />\nThe Dalkon Shield was an<br />\nI.U.D. developed by an OB-<br />\n<br />\nGYN associate professor of,<br />\nyes, Johns Hopkins and<br />\nmarketed by the A.H. Robins<br />\n(Robitussin, Chap Stick) Company between 1971 and 1975.<br />\nMintz begins his expose with a<br />\ngrisly enumeration of the<br />\nShield's disastrous effects. 4.5<br />\nmillion of the I.U.D.'s were<br />\ndistributed in eighty countries.<br />\nOf the women who wore the<br />\nShield, thousands suffered<br />\nfrom dangerous pelvic inflammatory disease, spontaneous<br />\nand spontaneous septic abortions, and subsequent infertility. Many bore children with<br />\nserious birth defects. Many<br />\nwomen died.<br />\nWhat follows is an absolute<br />\nRipley's Believe It or Not circus<br />\nto answer your incredulous<br />\n\"How could this have happened?\" Mintz parades before us<br />\nthe entire host of quacks who<br />\nmade it all possible, beginning<br />\nwith the Hopkins professor<br />\nwho sold his I.U.D.'s to the<br />\nmedical community with<br />\nbogus, virtually non-existent<br />\ntesting and even more fradulent<br />\nclaims of safety and efficacy,<br />\nwho fervently promoted his<br />\nShield while neglecting to mention his financial stake in its<br />\nsuccess\u2014and going right up to<br />\nthe Powers that Be at A.H.<br />\nRobins who for years consistently disregarded the<br />\nevidence on the Shield's hazardous properties\u2014just because it<br />\nwould cost too much to fix.<br />\nMintz serves you corporate corruption and avarice with all the<br />\ntrimmings, gorging you till<br />\nyou're nauseated with capitalist<br />\neverything.<br />\nThe main problem with the<br />\nShield was its multifilaments<br />\nstring, which, through \"wicking\", introduced bacteria into<br />\nthe uterus. During the endless<br />\n<br />\nlawsuits and investigations that<br />\nsurfaced in the wake of the<br />\nShield's initial grand entrance<br />\ninto society, the Robins Company repeatedly denied<br />\nknowledge of this fact, which<br />\nhad been regularly presented to<br />\nthem over the years by medical<br />\nexperts both inside and outside<br />\nthe company. The spectacle<br />\nMintz offers us of the company's evasions and supressions<br />\nof this fact is ridiculous at its<br />\nextreme. At a 1984 deposition,<br />\nfor example, Ellen Preston, a<br />\nsort of \"ambassador\" to physicians for the Robins Company<br />\nwas asked by a plaintiff's attorney, \"Did it ever occur to<br />\nyou to ask physicians whether<br />\nthey would like to know that<br />\nthe Dalkon Shield tail string<br />\npresented an additional source<br />\nby which bacteria could get<br />\nfrom the vagina into the<br />\nuterus?\" She replied, \"I've<br />\nnever discussed that with any<br />\nphysician, and in my opinion it<br />\nwas not a necessary fact to provide...\" A fact which had been<br />\nknown as early as 1970, and a<br />\nfact, which, if acted upon,<br />\ncould have saved hundreds of<br />\nlives.<br />\nFor the women, permanently marred, who did survive the<br />\nravages of the Shield, A.H.<br />\nRobins had only \"dirty questions\" and \"dirty tricks\" to offer as reparation. When the<br />\nlawsuits started piling in, it was<br />\na case of How Long Can You<br />\nGo for the company, who<br />\nbadgered the plaintiffs with<br />\n\"intimate, demeaning and even<br />\nintimidating\" questions about<br />\ntheir sexual practices, in an attempt to link these habits with<br />\ntheir complaints, and keep the<br />\nDalkon Shield blameless. The<br />\ncompany even conspired with<br />\nits insurance firm Aetna Life to<br />\n<br />\noc3c3<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\ncover the massive load of<br />\nevidence which denounced the<br />\nShield, and even refused to<br />\nrecall the Shield last year.<br />\nMintz is merciless in his determination to record the company's every sleazy criminal attempt to weasel out of their<br />\ncalamity. When you finish the<br />\nbook, you'll remember Minnesota Judge Miles Lord's 1984<br />\nreprimand to the three top officers of A.H, Robins, and find<br />\nyou've been thinking the same<br />\nthing:<br />\ncompany<br />\n\" .your<br />\nhas...continued to allow<br />\nwomen, tens of thousands of<br />\nthem, to wear this device\u2014a<br />\ndeadly depth charge in their<br />\nwombs, ready to explode at any<br />\n<br />\ntime. ..The only conceivable<br />\nreasons you have not recalled<br />\nthis product are that it would<br />\nhurt your balance sheet and<br />\nalert women who have already<br />\nbeen harmed that you may be<br />\nliable for their injuries.

Caramazza is a professor of psychology at<br />\nHopkins, specializing in<br />\npsycholinguistics, neuropsychology of language, and<br />\ncognitive processes. He and Dr.<br />\nMichael McCloskey are researching the structure of cognitive<br />\nsystems. In other words they<br />\nare trying to determine how the<br />\nhuman brain is organized to<br />\nenable us to understand and<br />\nproduce language in written,<br />\nspoken, or other forms.<br />\nCaramazza adheres to the<br />\ntheory of a mental \"lexicon,\"<br />\nor \"dictionary in the head.\"<br />\nThis lexicon contains all the<br />\nprocessing mechanisms which<br />\nact upon visual or auditory input and ascribes meaning to<br />\nthat input. Caramazza<br />\npostulates that there are two<br />\nseparate \"input\" and \"output\"<br />\nlexicons, which allow us to<br />\ncomprehend and communicate<br />\nlanguage, respectively. The only way to study these cognitive<br />\nstructures is to study what happens when damage is done to<br />\nspecific areas of the brain.<br />\nCaramazza and others are<br />\ntherefore attempting to determine what a cognitive system<br />\nmust look like, based upon the<br />\nparticular patterns that<br />\nresult from damage to a particular area of the brain.<br />\nOne such study is being conducted at Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nResearchers are tesing the word<br />\nprocessing ability of patients<br />\nwho have suffered strokes or<br />\nother traumas affecting<br />\ncognitive function.

The projects are<br />\nthat the kinds of functional working on processes of language<br />\norganizations, or groupings, comprehension, sentence produc-<br />\n<br />\ntion, sentence processing, and<br />\nnumber processing, among other<br />\nthings. Many significant examples<br />\nof deficiencies in all of these<br />\nfunctions have been discovered.<br />\nImpairments in reading illustrate the various aspects of<br />\ncognitive function involved in<br />\nthe reading process. Patients<br />\nwho suffer reading impairments after brain damage<br />\nhave acquired dyslexia. Some<br />\nof these patients can read most<br />\nnormal words, but are unable<br />\nto read nonsense words, or new<br />\nwords. This suggests that there<br />\nmust be a particular mechanism<br />\ndedicated to the production of<br />\nsounds, specifically for normal<br />\nstrings of letters.<br />\nOther patients have a related<br />\npattern: they can read words of<br />\nnormal construction, such as<br />\n\"bring\" but are unable to read<br />\nirregular words, such as<br />\n\"yacht\" correctly. It is believed that these patients have lost<br />\nthe ability to retrieve lexical, or<br />\nspecific word knowledge.<br />\nRetrieval of these words<br />\ntherefore requires word specific<br />\nknowledge.<br />\n<br />\nStudy Examines Births in Third World<br />\nIn the developing world,<br />\nfamily planning is not widely<br />\nused to postpone births. The<br />\nresulting lack of spacing between births costs the lives of at<br />\nleast 1 million children.<br />\nThese findings emerge from<br />\nthe analysis of survey results on<br />\nfertility and family planning<br />\npublished by the Population Information Program (PIP) of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of<br />\nPublic Health. The report<br />\ncovers 89 surveys of nearly half<br />\na million married women in.61<br />\ndeveloping countries, representing more than one-third of the<br />\nworld's population.<br />\nIn nearly all surveys, a majority of women said they<br />\nwanted either to postpone the<br />\nnext birth or to have no more<br />\nchildren.

They may name many<br />\npieces of furniture until they<br />\nhappen upon the correct one.<br />\nIn a recent case, a patient was<br />\nasked to read the word<br />\n\"mare,\" and he responded<br />\nwith the word \"rabbit.\" He<br />\nthen corrected himself, and said<br />\n\"she-rabbit.\" The explanation<br />\nhere is that \"mare\" is an<br />\nanimal word marked for<br />\ngender. The word \"rabbit\" is<br />\nnot marked for gender. The patient knows that \"mare\" is<br />\nfeminine and since there is no<br />\nfeminine word for \"rabbit,\" he<br />\nproduced \"she-rabbit.\" These<br />\nerrors indicate that the word<br />\nhas been processed; it has<br />\nentered the lexicon, and its<br />\nmeaning, or semantic representation has been activated. The<br />\nproblem is in retrieving the proper sound by the \"output\"<br />\nmechanism. Similar errors also<br />\noccur when patients are asked<br />\nto write down words snnver, tr,<br />\nthem, or when they are instructed to repeat aloud words<br />\nthat are spoken to them. This<br />\nindicates that the architecture<br />\nof the reading, writing, and<br />\nvocal systems are very similar.<br />\nThe cognitive system emerging from this data appears as a<br />\nbox within a box. First, the fact<br />\nthat the input system can be<br />\ndamaged while the output remains intact, and vice versa, indicates that there are indeed<br />\ntwo such separate systems.<br />\nWithin the input and output<br />\nsystems, there are the separate<br />\nlexical mechanisms for reading,<br />\nwriting, and speaking. A<br />\nperceptual mechanism is also<br />\nrequired which addresses<br />\nspecific meanings of objects.<br />\nThese, in turn, address specific<br />\nwords to these meanings in the<br />\noutput lexicon. Within a<br />\nsemantic lexicon, Caramazza<br />\nsees a single system in which all<br />\nthe meanings of words are<br />\nrepresented. Thus, the meaning<br />\nthat is retrieved is the same<br />\nwhether a word is seen or<br />\nheard. Within this system each<br />\nof the dimensions are separately<br />\nlinked. One dimension (i.e.<br />\nfruits and vegetables) can<br />\ntherefore be destroyed while the<br />\nother dimensions remain intact.<br />\nFinally, within each input lexicon, there must be information<br />\nabout the morphology of a<br />\nword. This includes its tense,<br />\ngrammatical class, and<br />\ninflection.<br />\nObviously, Caramazza and<br />\nhis colleagues have much work<br />\nahead of them. Although the<br />\nprimary goal is to discover how<br />\nwe are able to produce and<br />\nand<br />\nwords<br />\nunderstand<br />\nsentences, the long range goal<br />\nis to answer questions about<br />\nour deeper understanding, such<br />\nas emotions or esthetic appreciation. Eventually, too,<br />\nthese functions may be mapped<br />\nto actual physical areas in the<br />\nbrain. Caramazza, McCloskey,<br />\nand others will continue to concentrate on brain damaged patients in hopes of answering<br />\nthese fascinating questions.<br />\n<br />\n\f22/DECEMBER 6, 1985<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nJays Nip Catholic In OT For First Win<br />\nDoherty Hopeful Of Reaching .500 As Team Leaves For St. Louis<br />\nby Craig Brooks<br />\nThe men's varsity basketball<br />\nsquad is off to a not so outstanding start with one win in four<br />\ngames. A 74-72 overtime victory at home over Catholic has<br />\nbeen the lone bright spot thus<br />\nfar.<br />\nThe Jays began the season<br />\nwith the York Tournament in<br />\nPennsylvania where the squad<br />\nlost two tight games. Manhattanville downed the Jays 76-70<br />\nin the opening contest of the<br />\ntournament. The host team<br />\nYork then dropped Hopkins<br />\n73-66. Turnovers and a few<br />\ndefensive lapses hurt the Blue<br />\nJays in both games. Center<br />\nRalph Horne was the standout,<br />\ngaining all-tournament honors<br />\nwith two 20-point game<br />\nperformances.<br />\nForward Kevin Sottak came<br />\noff the bench and iced two free<br />\nthrows with eight seconds left<br />\nto give the Jays their win over<br />\nCatholic on the 26th. It seemed<br />\nas if Hopkins was trying to give<br />\nthe game away, blowing three<br />\nchances to win the game in<br />\nregulation. The Jays were able<br />\nto regain their poise in the overtime period, fortunately, and<br />\nthey pulled out a victory.<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\ngames.<br />\nEven the baskets haven't been cooperating with the Blue Jays this year in their first four<br />\n<br />\nMary Washington College<br />\nhanded Doherty's squad a<br />\n65-47 loss early this week, but<br />\nthe score wasn't indicative of<br />\nthe game. The Jays trailed by<br />\none with a little over three<br />\nminutes remaining.

The Jays were<br />\nforced to use a minimal number<br />\nof players since Mark Campbell, Jim Cardwell, and Tom<br />\nFinegan were on the football<br />\nteam; Andy Nicholas was a soccer player; Scott Burns had an<br />\ninternship in Washington; and<br />\nMike Goudy and Rob Durocher<br />\nwere injured during most of the<br />\nfall season. Nevertheless, this<br />\nsituation provided the Blue Jay<br />\ncoaches to look at numerous<br />\nplayers in different positions.<br />\nThe most pleasant surprise of<br />\nthe fall was the play of<br />\nsophomore Dave Psenicska.<br />\nUsed primarily as the main<br />\nstopper out of the bullpen last<br />\nspring (3 wins and 3 saves),<br />\nDave was used as an infielder<br />\nthis fall. He responded with his<br />\nglove, making many fine defensive plays.<br />\nSeveral other Blue Jays also<br />\nlooked good. Senior Craig<br />\nBrooks hit well despite having<br />\n\"only\" a .333 average.<br />\nSophomore Andy Karetsky<br />\nshowed some promise with his<br />\nplay in the outfield and his hitting. Len Guarna, another<br />\nsophomore, was used in centerfield and responded with some<br />\nexcellent plays. Ned Offit, a<br />\njunior infielder, looked good at<br />\nboth shortstop and third base,<br />\nand showed that he has some<br />\n\"pop\" in his bat. Finally, Dan<br />\n<br />\nINTERSESSION<br />\n<br />\nDurocher, a freshman,<br />\ndisplayed some power and the<br />\nability to perform behind the<br />\nplate.<br />\nSeveral pitchers looked good.<br />\nJunior Pete Blohm (7-1 last<br />\nspring) greatly improved and<br />\nhas the potential to be one of the<br />\nbest ever to wear a Blue Jay<br />\nuniform. Sophomore Brian<br />\nMurphy (4-2 last spring) bettered his pitch location and<br />\nshould be a force in the spring.<br />\n<br />\nSenior Dave Fearer, injured for<br />\nnearly all of his freshman and<br />\njunior seasons, regained the<br />\nstrength in his arm and looked<br />\noverpowering at times. Finally,<br />\nfreshman Jason Klitenic<br />\ndisplayed that he can throw<br />\nstrikes and retire college hitters.<br />\nThe coaches and team concur<br />\nthat the hard work of the fall<br />\nwill provide better results in the<br />\nupcoming spring!<br />\n<br />\n.H.\u201e.\u201e...\u201e.o.N.\u201e.,,.\u201e.\u201e.\u201e..,...\u201e.\u201e.\u201e.H.\u201e.,,.\u201e.H.H.\u201e.,,.\u201e\u201e\u201e.,,.\u201e.,,.\u201e.\u201e.\u201e....,,.\u201e..,.,..H.<br />\n,,<br />\n,a<br />\n.<br />\n,<br />\nSKI TRIP<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nTo Hunter Mtn., NY<br />\n<br />\nLibrary Resources in Chemistry<br />\nA SIX-HOUR COURSE FOR GRADUATE<br />\nAND ADVANCED UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS<br />\nCurrent Awareness Tools<br />\nAccess to the literature through indexes and abstracts<br />\nUsing the computer in on-line retrieval<br />\nReference tools for organic, physical and inorganic chemists<br />\nStrategy questions and answers<br />\n<br />\nTime: Tuesday-Thursday<br />\nJanuary 14,15 and -16, 9-11 a.m.<br />\nPlace: Eisenhower Library,<br />\nScience Reference Room, C Level<br />\n<br />\ni&<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n?*<br />\n.<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n-6<br />\ni<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n)41C=4X=NA<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\ni<br />\n6<br />\ni<br />\ni<br />\n4<br />\ni<br />\n6<br />\ni<br />\ni<br />\nI<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Services Committee is aa<br />\norganizing a trip for the weekend of:<br />\nii-4March 7.

Some of the<br />\n(many)screw-ups involved might be excused; taken together, they paint a sorry<br />\npicture of the university administration.<br />\nThe phones were installed this summer. Unlike past years, there is now a<br />\nphone in every dorm room, and they are<br />\nconnected to the university system. The<br />\nidea in installing the phones was to increase security. Since students who<br />\nwanted to visit the freshmen would now<br />\nbe able to call any room, the theory<br />\n-went, there would be no reason to leave<br />\nthe outside doors open.<br />\nApparently things didn't work out<br />\nquite so nicely. The testimony of both<br />\nfreshmen and housemasters is that the<br />\ndoors are still left open, meaning that the<br />\ninstallation of the new system was a<br />\nwaste of time. But even accepting the<br />\nphones as a fait accompli, all sorts of<br />\nproblems have now arisen\u2014all of which<br />\nshould have been avoided.<br />\nTo begin with, when the freshmen got<br />\ntheir first phone bill recently, almost<br />\neveryone noticed that the charges seemed too high\u2014way too high. As it turned<br />\nout, the bills had been calculated at an<br />\nincorrect rate. Essentially, evening and<br />\nnight discounts(of great importance considering that the latter is 60 percent of<br /><br />\nthe normal rate) hadn't been figured in.<br />\nArthur Heigl, director of Administrative<br />\nComputing and the man responsible for<br />\nthe bills, says all of this was due to \"an<br />\nerror in the computer program.\" Now<br />\nthe bills are being recalculated.<br />\nBut there are also all sorts of other<br />\nproblems. The freshmen were never told,<br />\nfor example, what rates they would be<br />\ncharged. Even now, Heigl doesn't seem<br />\nsure a rate sheet can be developed. Passing the buck, he says AT&amp;T is being<br />\n\"uncooperative.\" But the university<br />\nagreed to pay for AT&amp;T's services. Did<br />\nit do so without knowing what rates<br />\nwould be charged? If so, this is a case<br />\nnot only of incompetence but of flagrant<br />\nirresponsibility. The new system also<br />\ncharges students for long-distance calls<br />\nwhich go unanswered. Couldn't someone<br />\nhave at least told the freshmen that? And<br />\nwhy are the first phone bills being<br />\ndistributed now, four months after the<br />\nsemester began?<br />\nThe whole thing reeks of massive<br />\nblundering. Time and again mistakes<br />\nhave been made\u2014mistakes which could<br />\nhave cost students money, and which certainly cost them headaches. Bettye<br />\nMiller, the director of Auxiliary Services,<br />\nsays the administration is \"satisfied\"<br />\nwith its telephone service. If so, it has a<br />\nsingularly peculiar definition of<br />\n\"satisfaction.\"<br /><br />\nA Boring Semester<br />\nNobody ever accused Hopkins of being the most exciting school in the world,<br />\nbut even by this place's standards, this<br />\npast semester has to rank as one of the<br />\nmost boring ever.<br />\nThings started off fairly well. When<br />\nstudents returned in September, it appeared the summer had seen some important developments: a Fall Break had<br />\nbeen slipped into the university calendar;<br />\na General Manager for WJHU had been<br />\nappointed; Robert Welch had been appointed as Homewood's newest dean.<br />\nAll of that led most people around<br />\ncampus to expect an interesting fall. It<br />\nhasn't turned out that way. There have,<br />\nit is true, been a few things the university's central administration got excited<br />\nabout\u2014a new suburban campus, a fight<br />\nwith the community about expanding into Wyman Park, a major new building<br />\nproject\u2014but by and large these aren't<br />\nthings undergraduates have much to do<br />\nwith.<br />\nAnd at a level where students do have<br />\ninfluence, not much has happened. The<br />\nBlack Student Union tried to stir up a little activity by organizing a day of protest against apartheid, but that fizzled.<br />\nThis newspaper prominently reported the<br />\nuniversity's heavy involvement in the<br />\npresident's \"Star Wars\" program, but<br />\nnobody seemed to care much about that.<br />\nIt came to light that the dormitory meal<br />\nplan suffers from a ridiculous pricin<br /><br />\nwas precious little protest voiced there<br />\neither.<br />\nNor have there been the usual<br />\nacrimonious brouhahas between groups<br />\nof students. There has been no TEP<br />\nnewsletter, nobody has tried to change<br />\nthe Student Council's constitution and<br />\nthe Chairman of the Elections Commission hasn't thrown a childish tantrum at<br />\na public meeting. (We have to admit<br />\nthese sorts of things aren't really<br />\ndesirable, but at least they do make the<br />\nplace more lively.)<br />\nWhy the dull semester? There are a<br />\nvariety of reasons. For one thing, the<br />\ncampus simply doesn't have as many<br />\ndynamic personalities as it used to. It's<br />\nalso true the Student Council, choosing<br />\nto focus on increasing student services<br />\n(e.g., the McShuttle), has done little to<br />\ndevelop major issues. And the<br />\nadministration\u2014content in mediocrity as<br />\nusual\u2014has tried no fast ones like closing the Hut. Surely the major reason,<br />\nthough, is good 'ole Hopkins apathy. As<br />\nusual, students around here have been<br />\nperfectly happy to ignore everything but<br />\ntheir books.<br />\nWhatever the reason for the boredom<br />\nof the fall, let's hope next semester brings<br />\na few surprises. We doubt Hopkins<br />\nstudents can manage to shake off their<br />\nlethargy between now and January, but<br />\nat least the holidays are the right time for<br />\nmiracles<br /><br />\nfl/lrf 1 14;Abrittelti trrilrefN StiRifflitiWitt:t4leet el 4/4)R<br />\n...ma<br /><br />\nr\u2022-<br /><br />\n1111in\"<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nAfter reading last week's<br />\neditorial by Scott Proestel,<br />\n\"The Humanities 500: A<br />\nWandering Race,\" I was<br />\nwondering whether he has ever<br />\nactually taken any of the<br />\nHumanities courses here at<br />\nHopkins.

This<br />\nmysterious, restless music contains a multiplicity of melodies<br />\nwhich result not in dissonance,<br />\nbut in a fugue of staggering<br />\ncomplexity. The second movement also presents this plentitude of melodic motives in the<br />\nupper strings, but they are suppressed by gruff assertions<br />\nfrom the lower instruments.<br />\nThe almost wholly contrapuntal third movement was,<br />\nas the first two were, masterfully executed by the ensemble. In<br />\none section a heated duel<br />\nbreaks out between the strings,<br />\nand the group embraced this<br />\nopportunity to further heighten<br />\nthe energetic tension of the<br />\nwork.<br />\nIn the fourth movement, the<br />\npolyphonic treatment was once<br />\nagain emphasized as all of the<br />\ninstruments became \"soloists.\"<br />\nOften two or more would play<br />\na short tutti section, but the<br />\ngroupings were so dynamic that<br />\nfor two bars the violin would<br />\nmatch clarinet and the next to<br />\nthe French horn double bass.<br />\nA bright fifth movement<br />\nwith dances rounded out this<br />\npiece which the composer felt<br />\nto be a \"useful piece.\" Many<br />\ncritics, however, consider<br />\nHindemith to be the first composer since Schubert to achieve<br />\na more-than-quartet piece<br />\nwhich did not tax its listeners.<br />\nThroughout the performance, the Orpheus ensemble<br />\nplayed with precision, lucidity,<br />\nmusical virtousity.

No wonder<br />\nyou're such a monster. You had<br />\nto brave that toilet seat which<br />\novernight sucks cold air out of<br />\neverywhere.

These days a woman<br />\ncan't trust her medicine<br />\ncabinet: in one corner, you<br />\nspied a bottle of Thalidomide,<br />\nin another, a box of Rely tampons. Then in the center you've<br />\ngot a little package for your<br />\nI.U.D. and it's a Dalkon<br />\nShield. You should have 1)slipped on the tiles and died a<br />\npainless death 2) gone straight<br />\nback to bed. Next time, opt for<br />\nthe second, but first here's a<br />\nbedtime story\u2014nightmares<br />\nguaranteed.<br />\nAt Any Cost is an extensive<br />\nreport On the Dalkon Shield by<br />\naward winning Washington<br />\nPost journalist Morton Mintz.<br />\nYou may start out not knowing<br />\nor caring what the Dalkon<br />\nShield is, but Mintz will quickly grab you and force you to<br />\nreact\u2014perhaps with shock,<br />\nanger, or disbelief\u2014but never<br />\nwith indifference. From page<br />\none, the multitude of sinister<br />\nand horribly depressing facts<br />\nand statistics he's gathered and<br />\nartfully pulled together with his<br />\nmatter-of-fact style will keep<br />\nyou wanting to know more. At<br />\nAny Cost is suspense, drama,<br />\nmystery and high tragedy\u2014<br />\nunfortunately, it's all true.<br />\nThe Dalkon Shield was an<br />\nI.U.D. developed by an OB-<br /><br />\nGYN associate professor of,<br />\nyes, Johns Hopkins and<br />\nmarketed by the A.H. Robins<br />\n(Robitussin, Chap Stick) Company between 1971 and 1975.<br />\nMintz begins his expose with a<br />\ngrisly enumeration of the<br />\nShield's disastrous effects. 4.5<br />\nmillion of the I.U.D.'s were<br />\ndistributed in eighty countries.<br />\nOf the women who wore the<br />\nShield, thousands suffered<br />\nfrom dangerous pelvic inflammatory disease, spontaneous<br />\nand spontaneous septic abortions, and subsequent infertility. Many bore children with<br />\nserious birth defects. Many<br />\nwomen died.<br />\nWhat follows is an absolute<br />\nRipley's Believe It or Not circus<br />\nto answer your incredulous<br />\n\"How could this have happened?\" Mintz parades before us<br />\nthe entire host of quacks who<br />\nmade it all possible, beginning<br />\nwith the Hopkins professor<br />\nwho sold his I.U.D.'s to the<br />\nmedical community with<br />\nbogus, virtually non-existent<br />\ntesting and even more fradulent<br />\nclaims of safety and efficacy,<br />\nwho fervently promoted his<br />\nShield while neglecting to mention his financial stake in its<br />\nsuccess\u2014and going right up to<br />\nthe Powers that Be at A.H.<br />\nRobins who for years consistently disregarded the<br />\nevidence on the Shield's hazardous properties\u2014just because it<br />\nwould cost too much to fix.<br />\nMintz serves you corporate corruption and avarice with all the<br />\ntrimmings, gorging you till<br />\nyou're nauseated with capitalist<br />\neverything.<br />\nThe main problem with the<br />\nShield was its multifilaments<br />\nstring, which, through \"wicking\", introduced bacteria into<br />\nthe uterus. During the endless<br /><br />\nlawsuits and investigations that<br />\nsurfaced in the wake of the<br />\nShield's initial grand entrance<br />\ninto society, the Robins Company repeatedly denied<br />\nknowledge of this fact, which<br />\nhad been regularly presented to<br />\nthem over the years by medical<br />\nexperts both inside and outside<br />\nthe company. The spectacle<br />\nMintz offers us of the company's evasions and supressions<br />\nof this fact is ridiculous at its<br />\nextreme. At a 1984 deposition,<br />\nfor example, Ellen Preston, a<br />\nsort of \"ambassador\" to physicians for the Robins Company<br />\nwas asked by a plaintiff's attorney, \"Did it ever occur to<br />\nyou to ask physicians whether<br />\nthey would like to know that<br />\nthe Dalkon Shield tail string<br />\npresented an additional source<br />\nby which bacteria could get<br />\nfrom the vagina into the<br />\nuterus?\" She replied, \"I've<br />\nnever discussed that with any<br />\nphysician, and in my opinion it<br />\nwas not a necessary fact to provide...\" A fact which had been<br />\nknown as early as 1970, and a<br />\nfact, which, if acted upon,<br />\ncould have saved hundreds of<br />\nlives.<br />\nFor the women, permanently marred, who did survive the<br />\nravages of the Shield, A.H.<br />\nRobins had only \"dirty questions\" and \"dirty tricks\" to offer as reparation. When the<br />\nlawsuits started piling in, it was<br />\na case of How Long Can You<br />\nGo for the company, who<br />\nbadgered the plaintiffs with<br />\n\"intimate, demeaning and even<br />\nintimidating\" questions about<br />\ntheir sexual practices, in an attempt to link these habits with<br />\ntheir complaints, and keep the<br />\nDalkon Shield blameless. The<br />\ncompany even conspired with<br />\nits insurance firm Aetna Life to<br /><br />\noc3c3<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\ncover the massive load of<br />\nevidence which denounced the<br />\nShield, and even refused to<br />\nrecall the Shield last year.<br />\nMintz is merciless in his determination to record the company's every sleazy criminal attempt to weasel out of their<br />\ncalamity. When you finish the<br />\nbook, you'll remember Minnesota Judge Miles Lord's 1984<br />\nreprimand to the three top officers of A.H, Robins, and find<br />\nyou've been thinking the same<br />\nthing:<br />\ncompany<br />\n\" .your<br />\nhas...continued to allow<br />\nwomen, tens of thousands of<br />\nthem, to wear this device\u2014a<br />\ndeadly depth charge in their<br />\nwombs, ready to explode at any<br /><br />\ntime. ..The only conceivable<br />\nreasons you have not recalled<br />\nthis product are that it would<br />\nhurt your balance sheet and<br />\nalert women who have already<br />\nbeen harmed that you may be<br />\nliable for their injuries.

Caramazza is a professor of psychology at<br />\nHopkins, specializing in<br />\npsycholinguistics, neuropsychology of language, and<br />\ncognitive processes. He and Dr.<br />\nMichael McCloskey are researching the structure of cognitive<br />\nsystems. In other words they<br />\nare trying to determine how the<br />\nhuman brain is organized to<br />\nenable us to understand and<br />\nproduce language in written,<br />\nspoken, or other forms.<br />\nCaramazza adheres to the<br />\ntheory of a mental \"lexicon,\"<br />\nor \"dictionary in the head.\"<br />\nThis lexicon contains all the<br />\nprocessing mechanisms which<br />\nact upon visual or auditory input and ascribes meaning to<br />\nthat input. Caramazza<br />\npostulates that there are two<br />\nseparate \"input\" and \"output\"<br />\nlexicons, which allow us to<br />\ncomprehend and communicate<br />\nlanguage, respectively. The only way to study these cognitive<br />\nstructures is to study what happens when damage is done to<br />\nspecific areas of the brain.<br />\nCaramazza and others are<br />\ntherefore attempting to determine what a cognitive system<br />\nmust look like, based upon the<br />\nparticular patterns that<br />\nresult from damage to a particular area of the brain.<br />\nOne such study is being conducted at Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nResearchers are tesing the word<br />\nprocessing ability of patients<br />\nwho have suffered strokes or<br />\nother traumas affecting<br />\ncognitive function.

The projects are<br />\nthat the kinds of functional working on processes of language<br />\norganizations, or groupings, comprehension, sentence produc-<br /><br />\ntion, sentence processing, and<br />\nnumber processing, among other<br />\nthings. Many significant examples<br />\nof deficiencies in all of these<br />\nfunctions have been discovered.<br />\nImpairments in reading illustrate the various aspects of<br />\ncognitive function involved in<br />\nthe reading process. Patients<br />\nwho suffer reading impairments after brain damage<br />\nhave acquired dyslexia. Some<br />\nof these patients can read most<br />\nnormal words, but are unable<br />\nto read nonsense words, or new<br />\nwords. This suggests that there<br />\nmust be a particular mechanism<br />\ndedicated to the production of<br />\nsounds, specifically for normal<br />\nstrings of letters.<br />\nOther patients have a related<br />\npattern: they can read words of<br />\nnormal construction, such as<br />\n\"bring\" but are unable to read<br />\nirregular words, such as<br />\n\"yacht\" correctly. It is believed that these patients have lost<br />\nthe ability to retrieve lexical, or<br />\nspecific word knowledge.<br />\nRetrieval of these words<br />\ntherefore requires word specific<br />\nknowledge.<br /><br />\nStudy Examines Births in Third World<br />\nIn the developing world,<br />\nfamily planning is not widely<br />\nused to postpone births. The<br />\nresulting lack of spacing between births costs the lives of at<br />\nleast 1 million children.<br />\nThese findings emerge from<br />\nthe analysis of survey results on<br />\nfertility and family planning<br />\npublished by the Population Information Program (PIP) of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of<br />\nPublic Health. The report<br />\ncovers 89 surveys of nearly half<br />\na million married women in.61<br />\ndeveloping countries, representing more than one-third of the<br />\nworld's population.<br />\nIn nearly all surveys, a majority of women said they<br />\nwanted either to postpone the<br />\nnext birth or to have no more<br />\nchildren. But only a small<br />\npercentage of the women who<br />\nwanted to postpone their next<br />\nbirth used family planning.<br />\n\"These statistics reveal that<br />\na special effort is needed to en-<br /><br />\ncourage the use of family plan\u2022 Women are having fewer Surveys, conducted chiefly<br />\nning for spacing births,\" says children in many developing through Westinghouse Public<br />\nPhyllis T.

They may name many<br />\npieces of furniture until they<br />\nhappen upon the correct one.<br />\nIn a recent case, a patient was<br />\nasked to read the word<br />\n\"mare,\" and he responded<br />\nwith the word \"rabbit.\" He<br />\nthen corrected himself, and said<br />\n\"she-rabbit.\" The explanation<br />\nhere is that \"mare\" is an<br />\nanimal word marked for<br />\ngender. The word \"rabbit\" is<br />\nnot marked for gender. The patient knows that \"mare\" is<br />\nfeminine and since there is no<br />\nfeminine word for \"rabbit,\" he<br />\nproduced \"she-rabbit.\" These<br />\nerrors indicate that the word<br />\nhas been processed; it has<br />\nentered the lexicon, and its<br />\nmeaning, or semantic representation has been activated. The<br />\nproblem is in retrieving the proper sound by the \"output\"<br />\nmechanism. Similar errors also<br />\noccur when patients are asked<br />\nto write down words snnver, tr,<br />\nthem, or when they are instructed to repeat aloud words<br />\nthat are spoken to them. This<br />\nindicates that the architecture<br />\nof the reading, writing, and<br />\nvocal systems are very similar.<br />\nThe cognitive system emerging from this data appears as a<br />\nbox within a box. First, the fact<br />\nthat the input system can be<br />\ndamaged while the output remains intact, and vice versa, indicates that there are indeed<br />\ntwo such separate systems.<br />\nWithin the input and output<br />\nsystems, there are the separate<br />\nlexical mechanisms for reading,<br />\nwriting, and speaking. A<br />\nperceptual mechanism is also<br />\nrequired which addresses<br />\nspecific meanings of objects.<br />\nThese, in turn, address specific<br />\nwords to these meanings in the<br />\noutput lexicon. Within a<br />\nsemantic lexicon, Caramazza<br />\nsees a single system in which all<br />\nthe meanings of words are<br />\nrepresented. Thus, the meaning<br />\nthat is retrieved is the same<br />\nwhether a word is seen or<br />\nheard. Within this system each<br />\nof the dimensions are separately<br />\nlinked. One dimension (i.e.<br />\nfruits and vegetables) can<br />\ntherefore be destroyed while the<br />\nother dimensions remain intact.<br />\nFinally, within each input lexicon, there must be information<br />\nabout the morphology of a<br />\nword. This includes its tense,<br />\ngrammatical class, and<br />\ninflection.<br />\nObviously, Caramazza and<br />\nhis colleagues have much work<br />\nahead of them. Although the<br />\nprimary goal is to discover how<br />\nwe are able to produce and<br />\nand<br />\nwords<br />\nunderstand<br />\nsentences, the long range goal<br />\nis to answer questions about<br />\nour deeper understanding, such<br />\nas emotions or esthetic appreciation. Eventually, too,<br />\nthese functions may be mapped<br />\nto actual physical areas in the<br />\nbrain. Caramazza, McCloskey,<br />\nand others will continue to concentrate on brain damaged patients in hopes of answering<br />\nthese fascinating questions.<br /><br />\n22/DECEMBER 6, 1985<br /><br />\nSports<br />\nJays Nip Catholic In OT For First Win<br />\nDoherty Hopeful Of Reaching .500 As Team Leaves For St. Louis<br />\nby Craig Brooks<br />\nThe men's varsity basketball<br />\nsquad is off to a not so outstanding start with one win in four<br />\ngames. A 74-72 overtime victory at home over Catholic has<br />\nbeen the lone bright spot thus<br />\nfar.<br />\nThe Jays began the season<br />\nwith the York Tournament in<br />\nPennsylvania where the squad<br />\nlost two tight games. Manhattanville downed the Jays 76-70<br />\nin the opening contest of the<br />\ntournament. The host team<br />\nYork then dropped Hopkins<br />\n73-66. Turnovers and a few<br />\ndefensive lapses hurt the Blue<br />\nJays in both games. Center<br />\nRalph Horne was the standout,<br />\ngaining all-tournament honors<br />\nwith two 20-point game<br />\nperformances.<br />\nForward Kevin Sottak came<br />\noff the bench and iced two free<br />\nthrows with eight seconds left<br />\nto give the Jays their win over<br />\nCatholic on the 26th. It seemed<br />\nas if Hopkins was trying to give<br />\nthe game away, blowing three<br />\nchances to win the game in<br />\nregulation. The Jays were able<br />\nto regain their poise in the overtime period, fortunately, and<br />\nthey pulled out a victory.<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\ngames.<br />\nEven the baskets haven't been cooperating with the Blue Jays this year in their first four<br /><br />\nMary Washington College<br />\nhanded Doherty's squad a<br />\n65-47 loss early this week, but<br />\nthe score wasn't indicative of<br />\nthe game. The Jays trailed by<br />\none with a little over three<br />\nminutes remaining. But consecutive missed shots by<br />\nHopkins and a quick scoring<br />\nsurge from Mary Washington<br /><br />\ngave the Blue Tide a big lead<br />\nand command of the game. The<br />\nJays were forced to foul as time<br />\nwas running down and Mary<br />\nWashington converted its free<br />\nthrows.<br />\n\"Turnovers and sloppy play<br />\nhurt us, but I was pleased with<br />\nthe defense,\" said Doherty.<br />\n\"We need to work on our ball<br /><br />\nhandling as a team.\"<br />\nGuard Dave Wilson is currently leading the team on scoring, averaging 17 points a<br />\ngame. Horne is right behind<br />\nhim with 16 points a game. Forward Mike Kowatch is the only remaining player in the double figures with 11 points a<br />\ngame.<br /><br />\nOffensively, the Jays have<br />\nnot been effective in getting the<br />\nball inside consistently. Horne<br />\nmust score big or at least be a<br />\nthreat to score big for the Jays<br />\nto be successful.<br />\n\"The key to our offense is<br />\ngetting the ball to Ralph,\" said<br />\nKowatch. \"If he hits, the<br />\ndefense has to close in on him<br />\nand that opens the outside for<br />\nour shooters.\"<br />\nDoherty also is looking for<br />\nmore balanced scoring from his<br />\nstarters. Charlie Sikorsky is<br />\naveraging just seven points a<br />\ngame and didn't even score<br />\nagainst Mary Washington.<br />\nAlthough he doesn't put the<br />\nball up much, Sikorsky has a<br />\ngood shooting touch and needs<br />\nto be included in the offense.<br />\nChris Wasson is averaging six<br />\npoints a game but that should<br />\nimprove if Horne is able to<br />\ndraw more attention.<br />\nDefensively, Doherty is<br />\npleased with how the squad is<br />\nplaying aggressively.

With the contact<br />\non the play, Coach Dressler was<br />\nlooking for the foul call, but it<br />\ndid not come. \"It would have<br />\nbeen a tough call for the referee<br />\nto make,\" acknowledges Coach<br />\nDressler.

The Jays were<br />\nforced to use a minimal number<br />\nof players since Mark Campbell, Jim Cardwell, and Tom<br />\nFinegan were on the football<br />\nteam; Andy Nicholas was a soccer player; Scott Burns had an<br />\ninternship in Washington; and<br />\nMike Goudy and Rob Durocher<br />\nwere injured during most of the<br />\nfall season. Nevertheless, this<br />\nsituation provided the Blue Jay<br />\ncoaches to look at numerous<br />\nplayers in different positions.<br />\nThe most pleasant surprise of<br />\nthe fall was the play of<br />\nsophomore Dave Psenicska.<br />\nUsed primarily as the main<br />\nstopper out of the bullpen last<br />\nspring (3 wins and 3 saves),<br />\nDave was used as an infielder<br />\nthis fall. He responded with his<br />\nglove, making many fine defensive plays.<br />\nSeveral other Blue Jays also<br />\nlooked good. Senior Craig<br />\nBrooks hit well despite having<br />\n\"only\" a .333 average.<br />\nSophomore Andy Karetsky<br />\nshowed some promise with his<br />\nplay in the outfield and his hitting. Len Guarna, another<br />\nsophomore, was used in centerfield and responded with some<br />\nexcellent plays. Ned Offit, a<br />\njunior infielder, looked good at<br />\nboth shortstop and third base,<br />\nand showed that he has some<br />\n\"pop\" in his bat. Finally, Dan<br /><br />\nINTERSESSION<br /><br />\nDurocher, a freshman,<br />\ndisplayed some power and the<br />\nability to perform behind the<br />\nplate.<br />\nSeveral pitchers looked good.<br />\nJunior Pete Blohm (7-1 last<br />\nspring) greatly improved and<br />\nhas the potential to be one of the<br />\nbest ever to wear a Blue Jay<br />\nuniform.
