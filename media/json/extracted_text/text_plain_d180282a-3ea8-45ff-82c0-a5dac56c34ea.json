There seems to be a manifest need for<br />\nsome kind of regulation, but the idea of complete freedom has so<br />\npermeated Hopkins that undue opposition is always brought to bear<br />\nagainst anyone who is so bold as to suggest that regulations be resumed.<br />\nLast year we suggested a plan for enforcing a certain minimum number of regulations of which we approved. The suggestions, however,<br />\nseemed to meet with little favor. Since that time several new aspects<br />\nto the question have arisen and are well worth bearing in mind.<br />\nThe construction of some definite program of intramural athletics has been a problem of considerable note at Hopkins during the<br />\npast several months. Any program adopted would be aided by some<br />\ntype of freshman regulation. Since the abolishment of these rules, no<br />\nsort of athletic competition between classes has been held. Formerly<br />\nfootball and lacrosse and a track meet were held between the freshman and sophomore classes. Men who otherwise would participate<br />\nin no athletics whatsoever were given the opportunities which those<br />\nwho strongly favor intramural athletics bemoan the lack of at present.<br />\nIn spite of what may be said to the contrary, the average American<br />\ncollege student likes to feel that he is representing some organization<br />\nin any sort of athletic competition. Whether or not this body is a<br />\ncollege, class, or fraternity makes little difference. Freshman regulations are responsible for any organization in the present junior and<br />\nsenior classes that exists at Hopkins. Few of the freshmen or sophomores know the majority of their classmates either by name or sight.<br />\nThe requirement that freshmen and sophomores attend assemblies<br />\nhas not been enforced until recently and hence, the attendance has been<br />\nvery poor. The two lower classes have little respect for authority.

There seems to be a manifest need for<br />\nsome kind of regulation, but the idea of complete freedom has so<br />\npermeated Hopkins that undue opposition is always brought to bear<br />\nagainst anyone who is so bold as to suggest that regulations be resumed.<br />\nLast year we suggested a plan for enforcing a certain minimum number of regulations of which we approved. The suggestions, however,<br />\nseemed to meet with little favor. Since that time several new aspects<br />\nto the question have arisen and are well worth bearing in mind.<br />\nThe construction of some definite program of intramural athletics has been a problem of considerable note at Hopkins during the<br />\npast several months. Any program adopted would be aided by some<br />\ntype of freshman regulation. Since the abolishment of these rules, no<br />\nsort of athletic competition between classes has been held. Formerly<br />\nfootball and lacrosse and a track meet were held between the freshman and sophomore classes. Men who otherwise would participate<br />\nin no athletics whatsoever were given the opportunities which those<br />\nwho strongly favor intramural athletics bemoan the lack of at present.<br />\nIn spite of what may be said to the contrary, the average American<br />\ncollege student likes to feel that he is representing some organization<br />\nin any sort of athletic competition. Whether or not this body is a<br />\ncollege, class, or fraternity makes little difference. Freshman regulations are responsible for any organization in the present junior and<br />\nsenior classes that exists at Hopkins. Few of the freshmen or sophomores know the majority of their classmates either by name or sight.<br />\nThe requirement that freshmen and sophomores attend assemblies<br />\nhas not been enforced until recently and hence, the attendance has been<br />\nvery poor. The two lower classes have little respect for authority. Had<br />\nthey been accustomed to regulations in their first year of residence, it<br />\nis doubtful whether the student could have been compelled to discipline<br />\none-half of the members of the freshman and sophomore classes.<br />\nFreedom of action is a fine ideal, but some sort of regulation is certainly<br />\nnecessary at times.<br />\nG.
