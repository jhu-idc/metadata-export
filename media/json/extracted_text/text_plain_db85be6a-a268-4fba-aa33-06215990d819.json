However admirable these suggestions may be, they will surely prove useless<br />\nunless they fall upon fruitful soil. All of us are<br />\naware of a certain diffidence on the part of<br />\nHopkins men, whenever a comparison is<br />\ndrawn between their own institution and the<br />\nlarge and wealthy colleges of the North. Of<br />\ncourse, they are proud of the position occupied<br />\nby Johns Hopkins in the field of learning; but<br />\nas soon as the conversation turns upon those<br />\nqualities that go to make up a college in the<br />\npopular sense, they assume an apologetic attitude. Until this distrust has been removed,<br />\nwe cannot execute with any zest the schemes<br />\nfor improving our athletic standing and advancing the interests of the University by<br />\nother means, and the best way to remove it is<br />\nto show that it is unwarranted by the facts.<br />\nLet us take Harvard as an example. It is<br />\nthe largest, the oldest, the wealthiest of American universities ; it has more students in a<br />\nsingle class than the Hopkins in all its departments ; it has a beautiful campus and magnificent dormitories; and yet most Hopkins men<br />\nwould be surprised to see in how many respects it is inferior as a college to their own<br />\nAlma Mater.<br />\nThe chronic state of affairs<br />\namong the students at Cambridge is what a<br />\nwriter in Scribner's has termed \"Harvard indifference.\" \"If the football team has been<br />\nbeaten, we are sorry, to be sure ; but, after all,<br />\n<br />\nthe loss falls upon the University, and not<br />\nupon us \"\u2014that is the sentiment which their<br />\nactions and sometimes their words express.<br />\nThis fact is easily accounted for by the immense size of the institution, by the complicated system of social clubs, with its \"inner<br />\ncircles\" and wheels within wheels, and perhaps by a certain Northern stolidity of temperament. The important point for us is that<br />\nnone of these causes exists or is every likely to<br />\nexist at the Johns Hopkins.<br />\nIf, then, this is the condition which prevails<br />\nat so old and celebrated a college as Harvard,<br />\ncan we not disabuse our minds of the notion,<br />\nfostered by Yankee school teachers, that, in<br />\ncomparison with our larger rivals, the Hopkins has no college spirit ?

The House voted that there<br />\nShould be nine men to represent the class in<br />\nthis debate. Six, who will be regulars or alternates, will be chosen by the Censor, purely on<br />\ntheir merits, and three, who are to act as advisers, will be elected by the House. The<br />\nnames of all nine, if they are successful, will be<br />\nengraved on the trophy, which is to be placed<br />\nin the Donovan Room, McCoy Hall. The<br />\nquestion which is to be debated at Easter will<br />\nbe debated three times in the House, to insure<br />\na clear interpretation and forcible presentation of the subject.<br />\nThe impeachment of Mr. Kaufman created<br />\nquite a stir in the House. The charges are,<br />\nbriefly, that Mr. Kaufman is, as a freshman,<br />\nnot eligible to attend the meetings of the<br />\nHouse; that he has not the consent of the<br />\nCensor, which would enable him to attend.<br />\nThe attorneys appointed for the defense are<br />\nCongressmen Fisher, Guggenheimer and<br />\nRoss ; for the prosecution, Congressmen Mullen and Grimes. The trial, which will take<br />\nPlace at the next meeting of the House, will<br />\nbe open to members of other classes, only by<br />\nspecial permission of the Censor.<br />\nThe regular debate proved interesting, and<br />\nwas debated with considerable zeal and dexterity. The question was : \"Resolved, That<br />\ncapital punishment ought to be abolished.\"<br />\nThe affirmative was taken by Congressmen<br />\nR emsen and Keidel ; the negative by Congressmen Krager, Murkland and Davinson.<br />\nThe negative side, by their better presentation,<br />\nwon the debate.

The<br />\ntrustees are asked to charge a locker rent of<br />\nfive dollars, to prohibit the use of the gymnasium and cage to all who do not rent lockers, and to devote the money so raised to the<br />\nneedy cause of team athletics. This is a wellmeant, but misguided, effort. The possibility<br />\nthat the trustees would grant such a petition,<br />\neven if it were generally signed, seems very<br />\nremote.<br />\nIt rests upon a complete misconception of<br />\nthe purpose of college athletics. The gymnasium is designed to give to students, whose<br />\nlives are sedentary, the exercise necessary to<br />\ngood health. Inter-collegiate sport is a legitimate, hut by no means essential, outgrowth<br />\nof this principle. It would be unreasonable<br />\nand unjust to enforce from a student who<br />\nchooses to confine his exercise to chestweights and clubs, a contribution to the expenses of the teams. The lockers should be<br />\nfree, and every encouragement should be offered to the use of the gymnasium and cage.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Gilman.has presented his twentysecond annual report, of which we can only say,<br />\nread it. Many students have but vague ideas<br />\nof the work which is being done at this University. Often they are those very ones who<br />\nare always crying out on the lack of college<br />\nspirit. College spirit is a word which, we believe has never been defined, and which is accompanied by conceptions in different minds.<br />\nFor some men it is merely a form of rowdyism,<br />\nfor others, athletic enthusiasm, for many both<br />\nof these. Again, the different forms of class<br />\nfeeling are by many believed to constitute the<br />\nessence of college spirit. To us it seems that<br />\nloyalty to the University in all of its phases is<br />\ntrue college spirit. Uphold the honor of your<br />\nAlma Mater in all possible ways, spread her<br />\nfame wherever you may live, at present or in<br />\nthe future. This can be well done only by men<br />\nwho know of the work accomplished in all the<br />\ndepartments, and the quickest way of gaining<br />\nthis knowledge consists in reading over such<br />\npublications as the President's report.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER remarks a growing anxiety among certain seniors lest those good old<br />\nclays when the \"pot social\" was in our midst<br />\n(or we in its) may have already gone into history, and taken with them, also, those rejuvenating times when juniors, in spite of freshmen,<br />\nand freshmen on the sly, got together to make<br />\na joyful noise about the board, under the special inspiration of a clever deduction of Vinunt<br />\nvos liberabit from the University motto and the<br />\ngenerally accepted proverb, In vino veritas.<br />\nIs there any ground for this anxiety?

Yet the men here persistently neglect<br />\nthe one thing which will both improve themselves physically and at the same time add to<br />\nHopkins' reputation.<br />\nPerhaps it may be said that Hopkins needs<br />\nno athletic standing. True, we might not be<br />\nseriously injured as a College by the loss of<br />\nour teams, though the loss to the individual<br />\nmen would be great.<br />\nBut there is a consideration more important<br />\nthan that. In fact, the johns Hopkins does<br />\nplace teams on the field every year, and it is a<br />\nwoeful fact that we have to submit to defeat<br />\nat the hands of second-rate colleges. This<br />\nshould move every student to make all possible efforts for the improvement of our athletic standard.<br />\n<br />\nA GRADUATE STUDENT.<br />\nThe class of 'goo held A meeting Wednesday, January 5. The class elected Carroll<br />\nWight captain of the indoor baseball team,<br />\nwith the authority to choose a manager. Roland Abercrombie was elected member of the<br />\nHouse Committee of the new gymnasium.<br />\nThe meeting was well attended.<br />\n<br />\nA GRADUATE ON GRADUATES.<br />\n<br />\nThere seems to be an idea among the graduate students of the Hopkins that they have<br />\nno part in the affairs of the College in general.<br />\nThere was never a greater mistake. Graduates, as well as undergraduates, should, as<br />\nstudents of the Hopkins, lend aid to everything which concerns our College. Why<br />\nshould graduate students who are here to<br />\nenjoy the splendid advantages offered by the<br />\nUniversity feel that it is not their duty to do<br />\nwhat they can to advance her interests ? This<br />\nwe fail in many ways to do probably most<br />\nnoticeably in the line of athletics. To be sure,<br />\nthis is not the main end of a graduate student's<br />\nexistence, Other things should, as they do,<br />\nclaim our first attention. But anyone must<br />\nadmit the value of a trained body, such as is<br />\ngained through outdoor sports, and the least<br />\n<br />\nINTERESTING STATISTICS.<br />\n<br />\nProfessor S\u2014.<br />\nIn reply to Mill's theory, statistics show that<br />\nwomen who are college graduates marry as<br />\noften as other women.<br />\n(Prolonged break in the lecture while the<br />\nProfessor makes laborious efforts to explain<br />\nwhat he means, and the class makes as laborious efforts to follow his tangled line of<br />\nthought).<br />\nMary had a little wheel,<br />\nIt wobbled so at random<br />\nShe gave it up and hired a man<br />\nTo haul her on a tandem.<br />\n\u2014Exchange.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\nGYMNASTICS AND ATHLETICS.<br />\n<br />\nOn the 31st of December, 1897, there met at<br />\nthe Knickerbocker Club in New York, the directors of the gymnasiums of many of the<br />\nlarger colleges and universities.<br />\nA preliminary meeting had been held on<br />\nNov. 6, and invitations issued to the principal<br />\ncolleges and universities in the country to send<br />\nrepresentatives on the above date. Almost all<br />\nsent letters expressing a thorough sympathy<br />\nwith, and great interest in, the meeting. It was<br />\nsufficient, however, that the pioneers in this<br />\nwork, Dr. Dudley A. Sargent, of Harvard; Dr.<br />\nEdward Hitchcock, of Amherst; Dr. W. G.<br />\nAnderson, of Yale; and men from colleges<br />\nwhich are following in the footsteps of these institutions were present.<br />\nThe object of this meeting was to organize<br />\nan association to be known as the \"Society for<br />\nthe Advancement of Physical Culture in Colleges.\" For some time past gymnasium directors have felt that the \"American Association<br />\nfor the Advancement of Physical Education,\"<br />\ncovered too broad a field and was not giving<br />\nthem just what they needed, and what they expected. To fill this much-felt requirement, the<br />\n\"Society for the Advancement of Physical<br />\nCulture in Colleges\" had been organized. The<br />\nmen who compose it, must be members of the<br />\nparent organization and no gymnasium in,structor can become a member who has not<br />\nfollowed gymnastics as a profession for at least<br />\ntwo years. The new society will concern itself<br />\nwith gymnasium work alone, and thus directors will be brought closer together, methods<br />\nwill be criticised, and, best of all, a common<br />\nstandard will be adopted and arrived at by all.<br />\nA constitution and by-laws were adopted,<br />\nunder which Dr. Jay Seaver, of Yale, was elected President; Dr. Watson Savage, of Columbia, Secretary-Treasurer. These officers, with<br />\nDr. Sargent, of Harvard, and Prof. Cann, New<br />\nYork University, will constitute the council, or<br />\nmanaging board.<br />\nTwo papers were read\u2014one by Dr. Anderson, on \"Terminology,\" the other by Dr. Sar-<br />\n<br />\ngent on \"Strength Tests.\" Dr. Sargent, who<br />\nwas chairman of the committee appointed at<br />\nthe first meeting, read a report which, after<br />\nconsiderable discussion, was adopted by the society. This report -adopts the following<br />\nstrength tests:<br />\nr. Strength of right and left hands.<br />\n2. Strength of back.<br />\n3. Strength of legs.<br />\n4. Strength of lungs.<br />\n5. Strength of biceps and triceps, as shown<br />\nby the number of times a person can pull up<br />\non a horizontal bar, and push up on the parallel<br />\nbars. These two, added together, multiplied<br />\nby his weight in kilos and divided by ten is considered the strength of the chest and arms. Instead of strength of lungs. As no machine for<br />\ntesting the lung strength has been found at all<br />\nsatisfactory so far, one twentieth of lung capacity will be generally used.<br />\nThese measurements have all been taken at<br />\nHopkins University since the gymnasium was<br />\nfirst built. The main point of interest to gymnasium directors and to students is that Dr.<br />\nSargent and the Faculty of Harvard have enforced a certain standard of strength based in<br />\nthese tests as a condition of playing on teams.<br />\nThus in. order to play on a football team, or<br />\nrow in a boat crew, or contest in heavyweight<br />\nthrowing, a student must show a total<br />\nstrength test of 700 or over. In order to play<br />\nlacrosse or baseball, he must reach 600 or over,<br />\nand for track athletics, 500 or over. The directors who were present were asked to work on<br />\nthis basis in their colleges, and all agreed to do<br />\nso. When a student falls below these requirements he is debarred from a team, and no<br />\namount of favoritism can put him on instead of<br />\na man who has come up to the standard. The<br />\nonly thing for him to do then, is to work in the<br />\ngymnasium and bring his strength up to standard. In order to create interest in the \"strong<br />\nman\" the Society will offer a banner or medal<br />\nto the highest or greatest \"total strength\" made<br />\nby any one in the colleges. As an incentive to<br />\nour students, 1, Mr. Editor, will offer a prize to<br />\nbe competed for by the three classes.<br />\nIn your next edition, Mr. Editor, if you will<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ngrant me space, I hope to present from my records the strength tests of some of the best<br />\nteams in the history of the University.<br />\nJ.

In the second half the puck stayed in Walbrook's territory most of the time, only going<br />\nonce or twice near Hopkins goal, and giving<br />\nScholl a chance to make a couple of brilliant<br />\nstops. Toward the end of the half Hopkins<br />\nmanaged to use a little team work, and in the<br />\nlast five minutes of play McInnes and Hodges<br />\neach made a goal for Hopkins.<br />\nIn the second half Wilson, Walbrook's<br />\npoint, sprained his ankle and Turner took his<br />\nplace. Purnell put up the best game for Walbrook, but had a bad way of running over the<br />\npuck; in fact both teams found it very hard<br />\nnot to leave the puck behind, in their haste to<br />\nscore. The defense was good on both teams,<br />\nand Scholl in particular put up a great game.<br />\nHodges and McInnes did best for Hopkins<br />\non the attack.<br />\nThe previous game with Walbrook, Dec. 21,<br />\nalso resulted in a victory for Hopkins, the<br />\nscore being 3 to 1.

BAKER ON 11UNIC1I.<br />\n<br />\nMunich was the subject of an address delivered by Dr. Baker of the Modern Language<br />\nDepartment before the Historical and Political<br />\nScience Association last Friday evening. Dr.<br />\nBaker considers Munich the greatest art centre<br />\nin the world, easily outstripping Berlin, and<br />\nprobably even Paris. The growing supremacy<br />\nof Berlin in art is due partly to Emperor William's imperious interference in such matters in<br />\nBerlin, and partly to the impetus given to art<br />\nby the romantic and deeply lamented Ludwig.<br />\nTo say that a city is in Germany is equivalent<br />\nto saying that it is well governed. Munich is<br />\nno exception to this rule, and the business<br />\nmethods by which the internal government of<br />\nthe city are managed are a source of pride to<br />\nits inhabitants. The Mayors serve their apprenticeships, as it were, in smaller towns and<br />\ncities before they are called to the control of<br />\naffairs in Munich.<br />\nBusiness activity in Munich is noticeably absent. Almost the only signs of a brisk commercial life are shown by the one hundred<br />\nbreweries, which are taxed to their uttermost<br />\nto provide for the proverbial Teutonic thirst<br />\nfor \"Das Bier.\"<br />\nThe two features of Munich, which make<br />\nusually the most impression upon foreigners,<br />\nare the prevalence of cafe life and the numbers<br />\nof princes and implied connection between<br />\nthese is not necessarily inferred, yet they manage to exist very harmoniously together.<br />\nPrinces may be seen of all grades, classes and<br />\nconditions.<br />\nThe cafes constitute the principal \"rendezvous\" for all classes. One of the most perplexing questions for an unsophisticated American<br />\nis to know what title to use in addressing a native. It is a mortal offense to employ anything<br />\nelse than a person's highest title. A man's title<br />\nis always used in addressing his frau.<br />\nAt the conclusion of the address Mr. Renouf, of the class of '98, and the editorial staff<br />\nof the NEWS LETTER made a short talk based<br />\nupon personal reminiscences of a long residence in Munich. Mr. Renouf spoke df the<br />\nGerman fondness for Sunday picnics and ex-<br />\n<br />\ncursions. Whole families together go out in<br />\nthe country for several miles, and spend the<br />\nday wandering around and climbing mountains, and while occupied in the latter pursuit<br />\nquite a number fall and break their necks,<br />\n\"which pastime,\" Mr. Renouf curiously remarked, \"they enjoyed very much.\"<br />\nHERE AND THERE.<br />\nThe Business Manager of THE NEWS-LETTER can be seen at the office of the paper,<br />\nRoom 15, in the Administration Building on<br />\nHoward street, every Wednesday from 12 to<br />\nBills for this year's subscription<br />\n2 o'clock.<br />\nare out, and it is desired that returns be<br />\nR.

However admirable these suggestions may be, they will surely prove useless<br />\nunless they fall upon fruitful soil. All of us are<br />\naware of a certain diffidence on the part of<br />\nHopkins men, whenever a comparison is<br />\ndrawn between their own institution and the<br />\nlarge and wealthy colleges of the North. Of<br />\ncourse, they are proud of the position occupied<br />\nby Johns Hopkins in the field of learning; but<br />\nas soon as the conversation turns upon those<br />\nqualities that go to make up a college in the<br />\npopular sense, they assume an apologetic attitude. Until this distrust has been removed,<br />\nwe cannot execute with any zest the schemes<br />\nfor improving our athletic standing and advancing the interests of the University by<br />\nother means, and the best way to remove it is<br />\nto show that it is unwarranted by the facts.<br />\nLet us take Harvard as an example. It is<br />\nthe largest, the oldest, the wealthiest of American universities ; it has more students in a<br />\nsingle class than the Hopkins in all its departments ; it has a beautiful campus and magnificent dormitories; and yet most Hopkins men<br />\nwould be surprised to see in how many respects it is inferior as a college to their own<br />\nAlma Mater.<br />\nThe chronic state of affairs<br />\namong the students at Cambridge is what a<br />\nwriter in Scribner's has termed \"Harvard indifference.\" \"If the football team has been<br />\nbeaten, we are sorry, to be sure ; but, after all,<br /><br />\nthe loss falls upon the University, and not<br />\nupon us \"\u2014that is the sentiment which their<br />\nactions and sometimes their words express.<br />\nThis fact is easily accounted for by the immense size of the institution, by the complicated system of social clubs, with its \"inner<br />\ncircles\" and wheels within wheels, and perhaps by a certain Northern stolidity of temperament. The important point for us is that<br />\nnone of these causes exists or is every likely to<br />\nexist at the Johns Hopkins.<br />\nIf, then, this is the condition which prevails<br />\nat so old and celebrated a college as Harvard,<br />\ncan we not disabuse our minds of the notion,<br />\nfostered by Yankee school teachers, that, in<br />\ncomparison with our larger rivals, the Hopkins has no college spirit ?

The House voted that there<br />\nShould be nine men to represent the class in<br />\nthis debate. Six, who will be regulars or alternates, will be chosen by the Censor, purely on<br />\ntheir merits, and three, who are to act as advisers, will be elected by the House. The<br />\nnames of all nine, if they are successful, will be<br />\nengraved on the trophy, which is to be placed<br />\nin the Donovan Room, McCoy Hall. The<br />\nquestion which is to be debated at Easter will<br />\nbe debated three times in the House, to insure<br />\na clear interpretation and forcible presentation of the subject.<br />\nThe impeachment of Mr. Kaufman created<br />\nquite a stir in the House. The charges are,<br />\nbriefly, that Mr. Kaufman is, as a freshman,<br />\nnot eligible to attend the meetings of the<br />\nHouse; that he has not the consent of the<br />\nCensor, which would enable him to attend.<br />\nThe attorneys appointed for the defense are<br />\nCongressmen Fisher, Guggenheimer and<br />\nRoss ; for the prosecution, Congressmen Mullen and Grimes. The trial, which will take<br />\nPlace at the next meeting of the House, will<br />\nbe open to members of other classes, only by<br />\nspecial permission of the Censor.<br />\nThe regular debate proved interesting, and<br />\nwas debated with considerable zeal and dexterity. The question was : \"Resolved, That<br />\ncapital punishment ought to be abolished.\"<br />\nThe affirmative was taken by Congressmen<br />\nR emsen and Keidel ; the negative by Congressmen Krager, Murkland and Davinson.<br />\nThe negative side, by their better presentation,<br />\nwon the debate.

The<br />\ntrustees are asked to charge a locker rent of<br />\nfive dollars, to prohibit the use of the gymnasium and cage to all who do not rent lockers, and to devote the money so raised to the<br />\nneedy cause of team athletics. This is a wellmeant, but misguided, effort. The possibility<br />\nthat the trustees would grant such a petition,<br />\neven if it were generally signed, seems very<br />\nremote.<br />\nIt rests upon a complete misconception of<br />\nthe purpose of college athletics. The gymnasium is designed to give to students, whose<br />\nlives are sedentary, the exercise necessary to<br />\ngood health. Inter-collegiate sport is a legitimate, hut by no means essential, outgrowth<br />\nof this principle. It would be unreasonable<br />\nand unjust to enforce from a student who<br />\nchooses to confine his exercise to chestweights and clubs, a contribution to the expenses of the teams. The lockers should be<br />\nfree, and every encouragement should be offered to the use of the gymnasium and cage.<br /><br />\nPresident Gilman.has presented his twentysecond annual report, of which we can only say,<br />\nread it. Many students have but vague ideas<br />\nof the work which is being done at this University. Often they are those very ones who<br />\nare always crying out on the lack of college<br />\nspirit. College spirit is a word which, we believe has never been defined, and which is accompanied by conceptions in different minds.<br />\nFor some men it is merely a form of rowdyism,<br />\nfor others, athletic enthusiasm, for many both<br />\nof these. Again, the different forms of class<br />\nfeeling are by many believed to constitute the<br />\nessence of college spirit. To us it seems that<br />\nloyalty to the University in all of its phases is<br />\ntrue college spirit. Uphold the honor of your<br />\nAlma Mater in all possible ways, spread her<br />\nfame wherever you may live, at present or in<br />\nthe future. This can be well done only by men<br />\nwho know of the work accomplished in all the<br />\ndepartments, and the quickest way of gaining<br />\nthis knowledge consists in reading over such<br />\npublications as the President's report.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER remarks a growing anxiety among certain seniors lest those good old<br />\nclays when the \"pot social\" was in our midst<br />\n(or we in its) may have already gone into history, and taken with them, also, those rejuvenating times when juniors, in spite of freshmen,<br />\nand freshmen on the sly, got together to make<br />\na joyful noise about the board, under the special inspiration of a clever deduction of Vinunt<br />\nvos liberabit from the University motto and the<br />\ngenerally accepted proverb, In vino veritas.<br />\nIs there any ground for this anxiety?

Yet the men here persistently neglect<br />\nthe one thing which will both improve themselves physically and at the same time add to<br />\nHopkins' reputation.<br />\nPerhaps it may be said that Hopkins needs<br />\nno athletic standing. True, we might not be<br />\nseriously injured as a College by the loss of<br />\nour teams, though the loss to the individual<br />\nmen would be great.<br />\nBut there is a consideration more important<br />\nthan that. In fact, the johns Hopkins does<br />\nplace teams on the field every year, and it is a<br />\nwoeful fact that we have to submit to defeat<br />\nat the hands of second-rate colleges. This<br />\nshould move every student to make all possible efforts for the improvement of our athletic standard.<br /><br />\nA GRADUATE STUDENT.<br />\nThe class of 'goo held A meeting Wednesday, January 5. The class elected Carroll<br />\nWight captain of the indoor baseball team,<br />\nwith the authority to choose a manager. Roland Abercrombie was elected member of the<br />\nHouse Committee of the new gymnasium.<br />\nThe meeting was well attended.<br /><br />\nA GRADUATE ON GRADUATES.<br /><br />\nThere seems to be an idea among the graduate students of the Hopkins that they have<br />\nno part in the affairs of the College in general.<br />\nThere was never a greater mistake. Graduates, as well as undergraduates, should, as<br />\nstudents of the Hopkins, lend aid to everything which concerns our College. Why<br />\nshould graduate students who are here to<br />\nenjoy the splendid advantages offered by the<br />\nUniversity feel that it is not their duty to do<br />\nwhat they can to advance her interests ? This<br />\nwe fail in many ways to do probably most<br />\nnoticeably in the line of athletics. To be sure,<br />\nthis is not the main end of a graduate student's<br />\nexistence, Other things should, as they do,<br />\nclaim our first attention.

Almost all<br />\nsent letters expressing a thorough sympathy<br />\nwith, and great interest in, the meeting. It was<br />\nsufficient, however, that the pioneers in this<br />\nwork, Dr. Dudley A. Sargent, of Harvard; Dr.<br />\nEdward Hitchcock, of Amherst; Dr. W. G.<br />\nAnderson, of Yale; and men from colleges<br />\nwhich are following in the footsteps of these institutions were present.<br />\nThe object of this meeting was to organize<br />\nan association to be known as the \"Society for<br />\nthe Advancement of Physical Culture in Colleges.\" For some time past gymnasium directors have felt that the \"American Association<br />\nfor the Advancement of Physical Education,\"<br />\ncovered too broad a field and was not giving<br />\nthem just what they needed, and what they expected. To fill this much-felt requirement, the<br />\n\"Society for the Advancement of Physical<br />\nCulture in Colleges\" had been organized. The<br />\nmen who compose it, must be members of the<br />\nparent organization and no gymnasium in,structor can become a member who has not<br />\nfollowed gymnastics as a profession for at least<br />\ntwo years. The new society will concern itself<br />\nwith gymnasium work alone, and thus directors will be brought closer together, methods<br />\nwill be criticised, and, best of all, a common<br />\nstandard will be adopted and arrived at by all.<br />\nA constitution and by-laws were adopted,<br />\nunder which Dr. Jay Seaver, of Yale, was elected President; Dr. Watson Savage, of Columbia, Secretary-Treasurer. These officers, with<br />\nDr. Sargent, of Harvard, and Prof. Cann, New<br />\nYork University, will constitute the council, or<br />\nmanaging board.<br />\nTwo papers were read\u2014one by Dr. Anderson, on \"Terminology,\" the other by Dr. Sar-<br /><br />\ngent on \"Strength Tests.\" Dr. Sargent, who<br />\nwas chairman of the committee appointed at<br />\nthe first meeting, read a report which, after<br />\nconsiderable discussion, was adopted by the society. This report -adopts the following<br />\nstrength tests:<br />\nr. Strength of right and left hands.<br />\n2. Strength of back.<br />\n3. Strength of legs.<br />\n4. Strength of lungs.<br />\n5. Strength of biceps and triceps, as shown<br />\nby the number of times a person can pull up<br />\non a horizontal bar, and push up on the parallel<br />\nbars. These two, added together, multiplied<br />\nby his weight in kilos and divided by ten is considered the strength of the chest and arms. Instead of strength of lungs. As no machine for<br />\ntesting the lung strength has been found at all<br />\nsatisfactory so far, one twentieth of lung capacity will be generally used.<br />\nThese measurements have all been taken at<br />\nHopkins University since the gymnasium was<br />\nfirst built. The main point of interest to gymnasium directors and to students is that Dr.<br />\nSargent and the Faculty of Harvard have enforced a certain standard of strength based in<br />\nthese tests as a condition of playing on teams.<br />\nThus in. order to play on a football team, or<br />\nrow in a boat crew, or contest in heavyweight<br />\nthrowing, a student must show a total<br />\nstrength test of 700 or over. In order to play<br />\nlacrosse or baseball, he must reach 600 or over,<br />\nand for track athletics, 500 or over. The directors who were present were asked to work on<br />\nthis basis in their colleges, and all agreed to do<br />\nso. When a student falls below these requirements he is debarred from a team, and no<br />\namount of favoritism can put him on instead of<br />\na man who has come up to the standard. The<br />\nonly thing for him to do then, is to work in the<br />\ngymnasium and bring his strength up to standard. In order to create interest in the \"strong<br />\nman\" the Society will offer a banner or medal<br />\nto the highest or greatest \"total strength\" made<br />\nby any one in the colleges. As an incentive to<br />\nour students, 1, Mr. Editor, will offer a prize to<br />\nbe competed for by the three classes.<br />\nIn your next edition, Mr. Editor, if you will<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ngrant me space, I hope to present from my records the strength tests of some of the best<br />\nteams in the history of the University.<br />\nJ.

In the second half the puck stayed in Walbrook's territory most of the time, only going<br />\nonce or twice near Hopkins goal, and giving<br />\nScholl a chance to make a couple of brilliant<br />\nstops. Toward the end of the half Hopkins<br />\nmanaged to use a little team work, and in the<br />\nlast five minutes of play McInnes and Hodges<br />\neach made a goal for Hopkins.<br />\nIn the second half Wilson, Walbrook's<br />\npoint, sprained his ankle and Turner took his<br />\nplace. Purnell put up the best game for Walbrook, but had a bad way of running over the<br />\npuck; in fact both teams found it very hard<br />\nnot to leave the puck behind, in their haste to<br />\nscore. The defense was good on both teams,<br />\nand Scholl in particular put up a great game.<br />\nHodges and McInnes did best for Hopkins<br />\non the attack.<br />\nThe previous game with Walbrook, Dec. 21,<br />\nalso resulted in a victory for Hopkins, the<br />\nscore being 3 to 1. Hopkins is now tied for<br />\nsecond place, with a record of two gaiines won<br />\nand one lost.<br /><br />\nThe annual meeting of the Board of Amateur Athletic Records of Maryland was held at<br />\nCentral Branch, 17.

BAKER ON 11UNIC1I.<br /><br />\nMunich was the subject of an address delivered by Dr. Baker of the Modern Language<br />\nDepartment before the Historical and Political<br />\nScience Association last Friday evening. Dr.<br />\nBaker considers Munich the greatest art centre<br />\nin the world, easily outstripping Berlin, and<br />\nprobably even Paris. The growing supremacy<br />\nof Berlin in art is due partly to Emperor William's imperious interference in such matters in<br />\nBerlin, and partly to the impetus given to art<br />\nby the romantic and deeply lamented Ludwig.<br />\nTo say that a city is in Germany is equivalent<br />\nto saying that it is well governed. Munich is<br />\nno exception to this rule, and the business<br />\nmethods by which the internal government of<br />\nthe city are managed are a source of pride to<br />\nits inhabitants. The Mayors serve their apprenticeships, as it were, in smaller towns and<br />\ncities before they are called to the control of<br />\naffairs in Munich.<br />\nBusiness activity in Munich is noticeably absent. Almost the only signs of a brisk commercial life are shown by the one hundred<br />\nbreweries, which are taxed to their uttermost<br />\nto provide for the proverbial Teutonic thirst<br />\nfor \"Das Bier.\"<br />\nThe two features of Munich, which make<br />\nusually the most impression upon foreigners,<br />\nare the prevalence of cafe life and the numbers<br />\nof princes and implied connection between<br />\nthese is not necessarily inferred, yet they manage to exist very harmoniously together.<br />\nPrinces may be seen of all grades, classes and<br />\nconditions.<br />\nThe cafes constitute the principal \"rendezvous\" for all classes. One of the most perplexing questions for an unsophisticated American<br />\nis to know what title to use in addressing a native. It is a mortal offense to employ anything<br />\nelse than a person's highest title. A man's title<br />\nis always used in addressing his frau.<br />\nAt the conclusion of the address Mr. Renouf, of the class of '98, and the editorial staff<br />\nof the NEWS LETTER made a short talk based<br />\nupon personal reminiscences of a long residence in Munich. Mr. Renouf spoke df the<br />\nGerman fondness for Sunday picnics and ex-<br /><br />\ncursions. Whole families together go out in<br />\nthe country for several miles, and spend the<br />\nday wandering around and climbing mountains, and while occupied in the latter pursuit<br />\nquite a number fall and break their necks,<br />\n\"which pastime,\" Mr. Renouf curiously remarked, \"they enjoyed very much.\"<br />\nHERE AND THERE.<br />\nThe Business Manager of THE NEWS-LETTER can be seen at the office of the paper,<br />\nRoom 15, in the Administration Building on<br />\nHoward street, every Wednesday from 12 to<br />\nBills for this year's subscription<br />\n2 o'clock.<br />\nare out, and it is desired that returns be<br />\nR.
