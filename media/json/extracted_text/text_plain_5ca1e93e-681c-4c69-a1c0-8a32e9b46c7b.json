Term to begin June 1.<br />\n<br />\nBy MICHAEL WEISSMAN<br />\nA. Michael Hill was chosen<br />\nunanimously by the Board of<br />\nTrustees yesterday to fill this<br />\nyear's position as Young Trustee.<br />\nHill, obviously pleased by the<br />\nBoard's announcement<br />\nyesterday, commented, \"I'm<br />\nfairly excited about the prospects<br />\nfor the position. I am going to be<br />\nas active as any trustee.\"<br />\nHill was chosen to fill the<br />\nfour-year term by the Board at<br />\ntheir meeting yesterday over the<br />\nother two nominees for the<br />\noffice, D. Christopher Ohly and<br />\nMartin Vogel.<br />\nRobert D.H. Harvey, Chairman<br />\nof the Board of Trustees said<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\nvol. lx.xvi, no. 44/tuesday, aprit 18, 1972/baltimore, maryland/76th year<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nTenants quiet on housing<br />\nBy JIM FELICI<br />\nTenant inaction seems to be a<br />\nmajor complication in efforts to<br />\nrid Hopkins-owned buildings of<br />\ntheir apparent Housing Code<br />\nviolations.<br />\nAccording to several resident<br />\ncommittee members, the reasons<br />\nfor the inaction varied from<br />\nfrustration to simple apathy.<br />\nLarry Denton, Director of<br />\nStudent Services, denied<br />\nknowledge of the evidently<br />\nwide-based discontent with<br />\nHopkins living facilities, saying,<br />\n\"I am not aware of any housing<br />\nviolation complaints.\"<br />\nHe indicated that his office<br />\nreceives \"less complaints<br />\nconcerning housing\" than about<br />\nother sectors of the University.<br />\nDenton said that he based his<br />\nknowledge of tenant attitudes on<br />\nwhat he termed \"occasional\"<br />\nmeetings with the chairmen of<br />\nthe tenant committees in the<br />\nrespective buildings.<br />\nNew Plan<br />\nDenton also stated regarding<br />\nbuilding maintenance problems,<br />\nthat a \"general capital<br />\nmaintenance plan\" was to be<br />\nundertaken in Wolman Hall and<br />\nthe freshman dorms over the<br />\nsummer. He pointed out that the<br />\ncontroversial fire alarm system in<br />\nMcCoy Hall is a \"standard fire<br />\nalarm system,\" and could offer<br />\nno solution to its apparent<br />\nineffectiveness.<br />\nTruman Prevatt, McCoy Hall's<br />\nTenant Committee Chairman,<br />\nstated that reported complaints,<br />\nespecially concerning fire<br />\nemergency facilities yielded no<br />\nresults whatsoever. A quick<br />\ncheck of McCoy revealed that<br />\nfour legally required \"exit\" lights<br />\non and around the stairway were<br />\ninoperative. Furthermore, he<br />\nsaid, three fire doors were found<br />\nwhich would not swing closed,<br />\nand one of these required a heavy<br />\nshoulder to be thrown against it<br />\nto close it at all.<br />\nThe fire doors, when opened,<br />\nblock the stairway almost<br />\n<br />\ncompletely. The stairways also<br />\nlack emergency lighting facilities,<br />\nthus leaving the stairs in<br />\ndarkness, even during the day,<br />\nshould the building suffer a<br />\npower failure.<br />\nPrevatt went on to say that<br />\nrepeated complaints of a leaky<br />\nroof in the building were<br />\nanswered by repeated repaintings<br />\nof the sixth floor ceilings<br />\naffected. Inaction on these and<br />\nother counts reported to the<br />\nUniversity have led, Prevatt<br />\nexplained, to an attitude of<br />\ndisillusionment and frustration<br />\namong the tenants. In short, he<br />\nsaid, the tenants have given up<br />\nhope.<br />\nMichael Rosen, Tenant<br />\nCommittee Chairman of Wolman<br />\n<br />\nHall, blamed the lack of<br />\nmaintenance work done in the<br />\napartments there to tenant<br />\napathy. \"We got a few<br />\ncomplaints at the beginning of<br />\nthe year,\" Rosen said, dealing<br />\nwith rats, roaches and peeling<br />\npaint.<br />\nRosen emphasized that<br />\nchannels for the registration of<br />\ncomplaints were publicized<br />\nrepeatedly during the year, but<br />\nthat tenant input has dropped off<br />\nto virtually zero. The tenants, he<br />\nsaid, are very willing to complain<br />\nto each other, but do not refer<br />\ntheir complaints to anyone who<br />\ncould have them acted on.\"What<br />\ncan we do when people take<br />\nattitudes like that?\" Rosen<br />\nasked.<br />\n<br />\nafter the election, \"The Trustees<br />\nwere delighted with the qualities<br />\nof the candidates presented to<br />\nthem for consideration. They<br />\nmade their decision after a most<br />\ncareful examination, and they<br />\nlook forward to having Mr. Hill<br />\nparticipate with them in the<br />\nentire scope of the Board's<br />\nactivities in the years ahead.\"<br />\nElection Process<br />\nHill's election was the<br />\nculmination of a two-month<br />\nsearch. At the beginning of<br />\nMarch candidates for the position<br />\nsubmitted petitions with 25<br />\nsignatures. The field of 14 was<br />\nnarrowed down to three after a<br />\nstudent election later last month.<br />\nLast week a panel of Board<br />\nmembers interviewed the three<br />\ncandidates to make their<br />\n<br />\nrecommendation to the full<br />\nBoard. Hill's term will begin<br />\nofficially following his<br />\ngraduation, on June 1.<br />\nHill commented after the<br />\nannouncement that he would like<br />\nto see a direct election for the<br />\nyoung trustee position: In his<br />\ninterview with the Trustee panel<br />\nhe suggested making public the<br />\nresults of the student vote,<br />\nmaking the Trustees responsible<br />\nto explain their choice.<br />\nThe new Trustee maintained<br />\nthat he was not quite sure what<br />\nhe would do in his new position.<br />\n\"I can't really say that I am going<br />\nto do this or that. I just don't<br />\nknoW on what level the Trustees<br />\noperate.\"<br />\n<br />\nsee HILL, page 8<br />\n<br />\nMuller<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 predicts$1.1<br />\non budget deficit<br />\nPresident Muller predicted last<br />\nweek that Hopkins will be able to<br />\nreduce its budget deficits below<br />\nthe figures projected in earlier<br />\nbudget plans.<br />\nHe stated that the actual<br />\ndeficit for this year, predicted to<br />\nbe $2.4 million, would actually<br />\ncome in at a little bit below that<br />\nfigure, possibly as low as $2<br />\nmillion. Next year's deficit is<br />\npredicted for $1.1 million. The<br />\ndeficit for fiscal year 1973-74 is<br />\nto be half that figure and in<br />\n1974-75, the budget is to be in<br />\nbalance.<br />\nAlmost all of the budget<br />\ndeficit for next year will come<br />\nfrom the Arts and Sciences<br />\ndivision, which is to lose<br />\napproximately $1 million next<br />\nyear. The rest of the deficit is to<br />\nbe made up of losses from the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth. A & S's loss this year is<br />\n$400,000 lower than last year's.<br />\nFinancial Relief<br />\nA major source of financial<br />\nrelief has been a state grant of<br />\n$800,000 to the medical school<br />\n<br />\nand an unrestricted grant of<br />\n$350,000, which will probably<br />\nbe applied to the Arts and<br />\nSciences budget.<br />\nThe School of Advanced<br />\nInternational Studies in<br />\nWashington, a chronic deficit<br />\noperation, will have a balanced<br />\nbudget for this year, according to<br />\nMuller, because sufficient<br />\nfoundation support has been<br />\nrenewed.<br />\nA SAIS official stated, \"The<br />\nimminent exhaustion of Ford,<br />\nKellogg and Rockefeller<br />\nfoundation grants raises the<br />\npossibility of a $100,000 deficit<br />\nfor SAIS next year, unless<br />\nalternate sources of funding are<br />\nfound.\"<br />\nThe budget for next year will<br />\nbe sent to the budget committee<br />\nof the board of trustees this<br />\nmonth, and will be presented to<br />\nthe full board for final approval<br />\nin May.<br />\nFor fiscal year 1971, a budget<br />\ndeficit of $5.5 million was<br />\npredicted although the actual gap<br />\nonly amounted to $4.2 million.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins appoints Woolf provost<br />\nBy ALVIN STEIN<br />\nPresident Steven Muller, and<br />\nChairman of the Board of<br />\nTrustees Robert D.H.

He's not just<br />\nsome graduating senior, an old<br />\nNews-Letter editor, or even some<br />\nguy you play basketball with in<br />\nthe gym; he's a member of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.<br />\nMike Hill, clad in jeans, boots<br />\non the outside, and his<br />\nwide-brimmed hat hiding his<br />\nface, knows just about everybody<br />\nas he walks around the campus.<br />\nSome of the people say hello;<br />\nsome are a little frightened even<br />\nto nod. But everyone can tell<br />\nthat he knows what they may<br />\nnot know.<br />\nHe's been around. Freshman<br />\nyear he came up from an<br />\nUpper-middle class home in<br />\nAtlanta to Hopkins, that<br />\nfragmentated group, that<br />\nhomogeneous student body. He<br />\nlived away from home for the<br />\nfirst time. He cut classes. He did<br />\njust about all of the things that<br />\nfreshmen always do, but he did<br />\nsome other things too.<br />\nHe went to SDS meetings,<br />\nwhich not too many other people<br />\ndid. He played in a band made up<br />\nmostly of upperclassmen, who<br />\nmost freshmen never got to<br />\n<br />\nknow. In that year he<br />\nexperienced more than he had in<br />\nany other single year of his life.<br />\nPolitics<br />\nThe thing that tied all those<br />\nexperienced, and those that came<br />\nlater together, was politics, not<br />\nacademics. Academics were<br />\nhit-or-miss. Philosophy was<br />\nmined because it destroyed \"a<br />\nbeautiful explanation of the<br />\nmeaning of life.\" English was<br />\nsilly because it dissected and<br />\nanalyzed novels forgetting their<br />\nunity. Social Sciences were<br />\nalright but they were willing only<br />\nto describe what was happening,<br />\nnot to do anything about it.<br />\nAnd that's what Hill wanted to<br />\ndo. \"The whole thing about<br />\nradical politics is that it made me<br />\ntranscend national barriers; it got<br />\nme to exist as a citizen of the<br />\nworld,\" he said<br />\nHe got involved in politics,<br />\nforgetting that just two years<br />\nbefore he came to Hopkins he<br />\nhad sat out in the rain to listen to<br />\nDean Rusk, Barry Sadler and<br />\nAnita Bryant at an Atlanta rally<br />\nin support of the war.<br />\nAs a freshman it was the<br />\nCatonsville Nine and SDS.<br />\nSophomore year it was the<br />\nmoratoriums, our strike and then<br />\n<br />\nCambodia. But when he came<br />\nback for his sophomore year,<br />\nmilitary recruitment was back.<br />\n\"That was as far as we could go,<br />\nand it did no good.\"<br />\nSomething Else<br />\nIt's not that he quit or really<br />\nchanged; he was already an editor<br />\nof the News-Letter, but now<br />\nthere was more force behind it. It<br />\nwasn't because he had lost his<br />\nradical perspective; it was just<br />\nthat he wanted to do something.<br />\n\"I dug journalism and I dug<br />\nwriting, but there was power in<br />\nbeing on the News-Letter. At<br />\ntimes it seems silly to think<br />\nabout getting upset about a word<br />\nas small as Hopkins, but that's<br />\nthe way I work. I'm doing<br />\nsomething in this community.\"<br />\n\"If you were down to the<br />\nlowest, asking what life is, you<br />\ncould forget that. The paper had<br />\nto come out. You were doing<br />\nsomething.\"<br />\nThere were issues. There were<br />\npeople. There were things to be<br />\ndecided and done. It was easy.<br />\nMaybe it was because there just<br />\nwasn't anyone else to do it.

While undergraduates do make up a large<br />\nportion of the total University enrollment, they are far<br />\nfrom the only students here, and they are not the sole<br />\ngroup deserving of representation on the Board.<br />\nIt would be only fair if other groups here were to<br />\ngain some sort of representation on the highest<br />\ngoverning body in the University. As a first step toward<br />\nexpanding the amount of community representation on<br />\nthe Board, a graduate student in his last year of study<br />\ncould be elected to the Board to represent that segment<br />\nof the student body. Following that, students in their<br />\nfinal year at the Medical School, the School of Hygiene<br />\nand SAIS could be nominated to the board in the same<br />\nway undergraduates are now. There is no reason that all<br />\nthis has to be accomplished in one year. One new group<br />\ncould be added by election every year, while retaining<br />\nthe representation of groups which have already sent<br />\nmembers to the Board. This would allow some<br />\ncontinuity in the operations of the Trustees.<br />\nTo ask one undergraduate student to represent the<br />\nviewpoints of 10,000 students is grossly unfair,<br />\nespecially considering the fact that the interests of the<br />\nvarious segments Hopkins' student body are so<br />\ndifferent.

Having always lived in fantasies,<br />\nthe proud bearing and \"everything's fine,<br />\njust magnificent\" reply have long been<br />\nWilly's trademark. We find him now,<br />\nstripped of his commission and unable to<br />\nmake it on the road because all of his old<br />\ncontacts have either died, retired or<br />\nforgotten him. This is the most unkindest<br />\ncut of all, for Willy often shrugged off<br />\nwant of riches with the apology, \"I am<br />\nwell known and liked,\" an assertion hard<br />\nto maintain in penurious desertion. Not<br />\nthat Willy has trouble maintaining<br />\nassertions and dreams\u2014he is the master of<br />\nself deception\u2014but even that becomes<br />\nimpossible as the tragedy progresses. The<br />\npart is competently delivered in the style<br />\nof Lee J. Cobb by Richard Ward.<br />\nLoman's two over-thirty sons are the<br />\nfocus of his dreams. He's lived his life for<br />\nthem that they might shine like two quite<br />\nnoble stars. Hap, the younger, is, like<br />\nWilly, a lackey in business.

Those were the good old days and,<br />\ntrue to form, Willy escapes to that<br />\nglorious past for surcease of the present's<br />\nsorrow. Throughout the play we move<br />\nfrom bleak reality to halcyon memory<br />\nand back while Miller applied layer on<br />\nlayer of irony through parallel and<br />\ncontradictory images. Biff, portrayed by<br />\nDennis Tate in the evening's most<br />\nbrilliant performance, constantly changes<br />\nhis voice and moves from swaggering kid<br />\nto troubled man time and time again. He,<br />\nlike his brother, was brought up loving<br />\nsport and outdoor work. He's wandered<br />\nfrom job to job now for 17 years never<br />\nstaying anywhere long enough to rise<br />\nbecause: \"I never could take orders from<br />\nanyone.

Vidlations of the housing<br />\ncode do exist in University housing and nothing is<br />\nbeing done to correct the conditions. University<br />\nofficials have stated that they are unaware of such<br />\nviolations and have not received tenant complaints<br />\nconcerning the conditions. Tenant committee leaders<br />\nindicate that tenants are not willing to voice their<br />\ncomplaints because, in the past, the University has<br />\nfailed to respond.<br />\n<br />\n\"Isn't There Some<br />\nSimple Word For All Th,at ?\"<br />\n<br />\nIt is only logical that if poor conditions are not<br />\nreported, the University will not recognize and remedy<br />\nthem. Tenants in University housing must not use the<br />\nexcuse of past failure to justify their inaction. Tenant<br />\ncommittees represent a viable means of voicing<br />\ncomplaints and getting effective action. More tenant<br />\ncommittee meetings should be scheduled to give<br />\ntenants the opportunity to participate in up-grading<br />\ntheir housing conditions. Violations of the city<br />\nhousing code can be directed to the city Department<br />\nof Housing and Community Development. If these<br />\nviolations were reported, the University would be<br />\nforced by law to comply with the code. In the final<br />\nestimation the University is responsible for improving<br />\nthe housing conditions, but, without a vigorous pursuit<br />\nof standard housing by the tenants, the violations may<br />\npersist.<br />\n<br />\nDoctors try to cheer little people at Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nJeanne .f-embers<br />\n<br />\nseifing sit Liz,<br />\n<br />\nhousing complaints<br />\n<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThis is the first of a two-part series on<br />\nthe National Symposium on Short<br />\nStature, held at the Medical School on<br />\nApril], 1972.<br />\n<br />\nIt was April Fool's Day at the Hopkins<br />\nmedical school and the little people were<br />\nin town.

Inside the lecture hall, the talk of<br />\nmutations and genetics and<br />\nchondodystrophy was surrounded by an<br />\nerrie, absorbed silence.

The<br />\nlights went out, and in the dark, the<br />\ndwarves watched their incurable handicap<br />\nparaded before them in a series of genetic<br />\ncharts and depressing photos that were<br />\nflashed on a screen.

The dark eyes stared out at<br />\nthe camera with a flat, almost mournful,<br />\nseriousness. There were more pictures for<br />\nthe audience to see, and after a while it<br />\nstopped.<br />\nThe lights went on to the sound of<br />\nobedient applause, which the speaker<br />\nacknowledged with a mild flush of<br />\nprofessional pride. The pleasant<br />\ncourtesies of succesful men were<br />\nexchanged, and the next speaker,<br />\nbehaviorist psychologist Philip Drash,<br />\ntook his rightful place at the lectern. His<br />\ntalk would be the most painful of all, but<br />\nhe seemed glibly unaware of the effect of<br />\nhis comments.<br />\nExtensive Work<br />\nHe bounded to the front, exuberant<br />\nand vigorods, a stocky man quick to tell<br />\nof his extensive work in the field, the<br />\ngrants, studies, reports, triumphs. Above<br />\nall, he was a behaviorist, and with a<br />\nconfident optimism he told the dwarves<br />\nand their parents of how the old<br />\nproblems would crumble before this new<br />\ntechnique. \"Behaviorism,\" he told the<br />\nparents, \"has been able to deal with the<br />\nproblems that the outdated tools of<br />\nreward and punishment have not been<br />\nable to reach.\" Positive reinforcement<br />\nwas the key.<br />\nSo first he would tell them about di(<br />\ndifficulties that commonly faced the<br />\ndwarf and his family as the child grew up,<br />\nand then\u2014and here at last was the<br />\nlong-sought-Answer\u2014he would take a<br />\nspecific emotional problem and show<br />\nthem how to solve it. The crowd stirred<br />\nwith expectation.<br />\nAlone in the front rows, or with their<br />\nparents, the children focused on Drash as<br />\nhe unveiled before them, in his genial<br />\nbooming voice, the upcoming obstacles<br />\nof their lives. He passed through each<br />\nphase easily, pausing only to mark down<br />\nthe stages on the blackboard, leaving<br />\nbehind each one as soon as the new<br />\nnumeral appeared on the board.

Drash compiled<br />\nwhat he felt were a series of clever retorts<br />\nthat would be useful in a variety of<br />\nsituations, and he urged parents to coach<br />\ntheir children in the art of ranking out<br />\nother children. In a report circulated<br />\noutside the lecture room, seVeral sample<br />\ninsults were listed. The bitter jokes<br />\nconveyed only panic and isolation.<br />\nYou imagined the parents shouting out<br />\nmock insults to their bewildered child<br />\nacross the living-room floor. The family<br />\nwould shield themselves within the walls<br />\nof their home; the ridicule outside could<br />\nbe tempered in these rehearsals for life.<br />\n<br />\nDrash in addition, also included more<br />\nserious retorts for adult use. But the<br />\nnecessity of even compiling helpful<br />\nresponses revealed the surprising depth of<br />\nhuman cruelty. A demented burlesque<br />\nact was being played out in schoolyards<br />\nthroughout the nation, and the fall-guys<br />\nwanted the show to end.<br />\nThe hope of Drash's talk, however, was<br />\nthe behaviorist approach.

All-American<br />\nattackman Jay Connor, the<br />\nhighest scorer in Virginia lacrosse<br />\n<br />\nhistory, easily fooled Blue Jay<br />\ngoalie Les Matthews by flipping a<br />\nshot to the opposite side of the<br />\nnet after coming from behind the<br />\ncrease from his right side.<br />\nHopkins midfielder Rick<br />\nKowalchuk knotted the count at<br />\n12:57 of the period by beating<br />\ndefender Ted Coburn before<br />\nDoug Cooper put the Cavaliers<br />\nback on top by converting a<br />\nscreen shot on a Connor feed<br />\nbarely a minute later.

Thomas planted his<br />\nframe near the sideline past the<br />\nrestraining line on the northeast<br />\nside of the field, waiting for<br />\nfreshman defender Ed Spencer to<br />\ncommit himself. Spencer was<br />\ncontent to stay eight to ten yards<br />\noff the super-sophomore as<br />\nThomas stood immobile to run<br />\nseven and one half minutes off<br />\nthe clock. If the intent of the<br />\nslowdown was to calm the<br />\ninexperienced Blue Jays, it had<br />\nto rate as an unqualified success.<br />\nAlthough the first period 0<br />\nconcluded with Hopkins trailing,<br />\nJack Thomas scores diving goal.

He pointed out that the<br />\ncontroversial fire alarm system in<br />\nMcCoy Hall is a \"standard fire<br />\nalarm system,\" and could offer<br />\nno solution to its apparent<br />\nineffectiveness.<br />\nTruman Prevatt, McCoy Hall's<br />\nTenant Committee Chairman,<br />\nstated that reported complaints,<br />\nespecially concerning fire<br />\nemergency facilities yielded no<br />\nresults whatsoever. A quick<br />\ncheck of McCoy revealed that<br />\nfour legally required \"exit\" lights<br />\non and around the stairway were<br />\ninoperative. Furthermore, he<br />\nsaid, three fire doors were found<br />\nwhich would not swing closed,<br />\nand one of these required a heavy<br />\nshoulder to be thrown against it<br />\nto close it at all.<br />\nThe fire doors, when opened,<br />\nblock the stairway almost<br /><br />\ncompletely. The stairways also<br />\nlack emergency lighting facilities,<br />\nthus leaving the stairs in<br />\ndarkness, even during the day,<br />\nshould the building suffer a<br />\npower failure.<br />\nPrevatt went on to say that<br />\nrepeated complaints of a leaky<br />\nroof in the building were<br />\nanswered by repeated repaintings<br />\nof the sixth floor ceilings<br />\naffected. Inaction on these and<br />\nother counts reported to the<br />\nUniversity have led, Prevatt<br />\nexplained, to an attitude of<br />\ndisillusionment and frustration<br />\namong the tenants. In short, he<br />\nsaid, the tenants have given up<br />\nhope.<br />\nMichael Rosen, Tenant<br />\nCommittee Chairman of Wolman<br /><br />\nHall, blamed the lack of<br />\nmaintenance work done in the<br />\napartments there to tenant<br />\napathy. \"We got a few<br />\ncomplaints at the beginning of<br />\nthe year,\" Rosen said, dealing<br />\nwith rats, roaches and peeling<br />\npaint.<br />\nRosen emphasized that<br />\nchannels for the registration of<br />\ncomplaints were publicized<br />\nrepeatedly during the year, but<br />\nthat tenant input has dropped off<br />\nto virtually zero. The tenants, he<br />\nsaid, are very willing to complain<br />\nto each other, but do not refer<br />\ntheir complaints to anyone who<br />\ncould have them acted on.\"What<br />\ncan we do when people take<br />\nattitudes like that?\" Rosen<br />\nasked.<br /><br />\nafter the election, \"The Trustees<br />\nwere delighted with the qualities<br />\nof the candidates presented to<br />\nthem for consideration. They<br />\nmade their decision after a most<br />\ncareful examination, and they<br />\nlook forward to having Mr. Hill<br />\nparticipate with them in the<br />\nentire scope of the Board's<br />\nactivities in the years ahead.\"<br />\nElection Process<br />\nHill's election was the<br />\nculmination of a two-month<br />\nsearch.

He's not just<br />\nsome graduating senior, an old<br />\nNews-Letter editor, or even some<br />\nguy you play basketball with in<br />\nthe gym; he's a member of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.<br />\nMike Hill, clad in jeans, boots<br />\non the outside, and his<br />\nwide-brimmed hat hiding his<br />\nface, knows just about everybody<br />\nas he walks around the campus.<br />\nSome of the people say hello;<br />\nsome are a little frightened even<br />\nto nod. But everyone can tell<br />\nthat he knows what they may<br />\nnot know.<br />\nHe's been around. Freshman<br />\nyear he came up from an<br />\nUpper-middle class home in<br />\nAtlanta to Hopkins, that<br />\nfragmentated group, that<br />\nhomogeneous student body. He<br />\nlived away from home for the<br />\nfirst time. He cut classes. He did<br />\njust about all of the things that<br />\nfreshmen always do, but he did<br />\nsome other things too.<br />\nHe went to SDS meetings,<br />\nwhich not too many other people<br />\ndid. He played in a band made up<br />\nmostly of upperclassmen, who<br />\nmost freshmen never got to<br /><br />\nknow. In that year he<br />\nexperienced more than he had in<br />\nany other single year of his life.<br />\nPolitics<br />\nThe thing that tied all those<br />\nexperienced, and those that came<br />\nlater together, was politics, not<br />\nacademics. Academics were<br />\nhit-or-miss. Philosophy was<br />\nmined because it destroyed \"a<br />\nbeautiful explanation of the<br />\nmeaning of life.\" English was<br />\nsilly because it dissected and<br />\nanalyzed novels forgetting their<br />\nunity. Social Sciences were<br />\nalright but they were willing only<br />\nto describe what was happening,<br />\nnot to do anything about it.<br />\nAnd that's what Hill wanted to<br />\ndo. \"The whole thing about<br />\nradical politics is that it made me<br />\ntranscend national barriers; it got<br />\nme to exist as a citizen of the<br />\nworld,\" he said<br />\nHe got involved in politics,<br />\nforgetting that just two years<br />\nbefore he came to Hopkins he<br />\nhad sat out in the rain to listen to<br />\nDean Rusk, Barry Sadler and<br />\nAnita Bryant at an Atlanta rally<br />\nin support of the war.<br />\nAs a freshman it was the<br />\nCatonsville Nine and SDS.<br />\nSophomore year it was the<br />\nmoratoriums, our strike and then<br /><br />\nCambodia. But when he came<br />\nback for his sophomore year,<br />\nmilitary recruitment was back.<br />\n\"That was as far as we could go,<br />\nand it did no good.\"<br />\nSomething Else<br />\nIt's not that he quit or really<br />\nchanged; he was already an editor<br />\nof the News-Letter, but now<br />\nthere was more force behind it. It<br />\nwasn't because he had lost his<br />\nradical perspective; it was just<br />\nthat he wanted to do something.<br />\n\"I dug journalism and I dug<br />\nwriting, but there was power in<br />\nbeing on the News-Letter. At<br />\ntimes it seems silly to think<br />\nabout getting upset about a word<br />\nas small as Hopkins, but that's<br />\nthe way I work. I'm doing<br />\nsomething in this community.\"<br />\n\"If you were down to the<br />\nlowest, asking what life is, you<br />\ncould forget that. The paper had<br />\nto come out. You were doing<br />\nsomething.\"<br />\nThere were issues. There were<br />\npeople. There were things to be<br />\ndecided and done. It was easy.<br />\nMaybe it was because there just<br />\nwasn't anyone else to do it. Or<br />\nmore possibly Hill just wanted to<br /><br />\n\"That'was asfar as we could go,and it did no good.\"<br />\ndo it.<br />\n\"I am constantly amazed how<br />\neasy it is to be good, because<br />\npeople are usually so shitty.

The<br />\nColonel was no aid at all, and it<br />\nseems to me the administration<br />\nshould be looking for people to<br />\nuse the social lounge,\" declared<br />\nStein.<br /><br />\nBy WARREN GULIN<br />\nLow student participation has<br />\nmarked this year's campaign for<br />\nclass officers. Two offices are<br />\nuncontested while there are three<br />\noffices for which no one has<br />\nfiled.<br />\nOnly 387 students had cast<br />\nballots yesterday, according to<br />\nBob Belflower, Election<br />\nCommittee Chairman. Offices<br />\nfor which no candidate is running<br />\ncan be awarded to write-in<br />\ncandidates, provided the<br />\ncandidate receives at least 50<br />\nvotes.<br />\nOne candidate blamed the<br />\n\"ineffectual Student Council\"<br />\nfor the undergraduate student<br />\nbody's indifference. \"The<br />\nCouncil's image as an uninhibited<br />\nfree-for-all discourages students<br />\nfrom running.

Sinnoway categorically<br />\nrefused to offer \"campaign<br />\npromises.\"<br />\nNelson criticized Dr. David<br />\nDonald, History, for \"teaching<br />\nonly one course in the last five<br />\nsemesters.\" Donald is the Harry<br />\nC.

While undergraduates do make up a large<br />\nportion of the total University enrollment, they are far<br />\nfrom the only students here, and they are not the sole<br />\ngroup deserving of representation on the Board.<br />\nIt would be only fair if other groups here were to<br />\ngain some sort of representation on the highest<br />\ngoverning body in the University. As a first step toward<br />\nexpanding the amount of community representation on<br />\nthe Board, a graduate student in his last year of study<br />\ncould be elected to the Board to represent that segment<br />\nof the student body. Following that, students in their<br />\nfinal year at the Medical School, the School of Hygiene<br />\nand SAIS could be nominated to the board in the same<br />\nway undergraduates are now. There is no reason that all<br />\nthis has to be accomplished in one year. One new group<br />\ncould be added by election every year, while retaining<br />\nthe representation of groups which have already sent<br />\nmembers to the Board. This would allow some<br />\ncontinuity in the operations of the Trustees.<br />\nTo ask one undergraduate student to represent the<br />\nviewpoints of 10,000 students is grossly unfair,<br />\nespecially considering the fact that the interests of the<br />\nvarious segments Hopkins' student body are so<br />\ndifferent. The Board of Trustees is the University's<br />\nonly legal entity and it is fitting that students, those for<br />\nwhom Hopkins exists, should all be equally represented<br />\nthere.<br /><br />\nletters to the editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nPlanned Parenthood of Maryland<br />\nheartily commends the new policy of the<br />\nHopkins News-Letter, to refuse<br />\nadvertising from fee-charging abortion<br />\nreferral agencies. It is indeed a sign of<br />\nyour unity of feeling with those who<br />\nactively seek to have abortion accepted as<br />\na ligitimate medical service. Referrals for<br />\nprofit by agencies that totally ignore the<br />\nmedical (and moral) responsibility of<br />\nbeing sensitive to the woman involved<br />\nand offering her a counselling situation<br />\nwill aid in keeping abortion in that<br />\ntwilight zone of acceptability.<br />\nWe concur with Dr. Chestnut of the<br />\nStudent Health Services (News-Letter,<br />\nTuesday, April II, 1972) in hoping that<br />\nyou will continue to give publicity to<br />\ncommunity agencies such as ours, the<br />\nPeople's Free Medical Clinic, Florence<br />\nCrittenton Services, the Baltimore City<br />\nHealth Department,and,according to Dr.<br />\ntXleaktb Service<br />\nC.-YO<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI wish to call your attention to the<br />\narticle which was written by Sue<br />\nWoolhiser in your paper on April 7,<br />\nabout the Shriver Hall Concert Series.<br />\nYour reporter suggests that concert<br />\ntickets are available to students by<br />\nsubscription only, which is absolutely<br />\nincorrect.

The Center<br />\nStage production marks the first<br />\nAmerican edition of this drama with an<br />\nall black cast.<br />\nThe tenor of the play changes little.<br />\nWilly Loman, a 63-year-old road salesman<br />\nwhose contacts have dried up, whose sons<br />\nhave amounted to nothing, and whose<br />\ndreams have remained only dreams.<br />\ncaptures reality in black or white.<br />\nWe enter Willy's life just prior to its<br />\nnadir. Having always lived in fantasies,<br />\nthe proud bearing and \"everything's fine,<br />\njust magnificent\" reply have long been<br />\nWilly's trademark. We find him now,<br />\nstripped of his commission and unable to<br />\nmake it on the road because all of his old<br />\ncontacts have either died, retired or<br />\nforgotten him. This is the most unkindest<br />\ncut of all, for Willy often shrugged off<br />\nwant of riches with the apology, \"I am<br />\nwell known and liked,\" an assertion hard<br />\nto maintain in penurious desertion. Not<br />\nthat Willy has trouble maintaining<br />\nassertions and dreams\u2014he is the master of<br />\nself deception\u2014but even that becomes<br />\nimpossible as the tragedy progresses. The<br />\npart is competently delivered in the style<br />\nof Lee J. Cobb by Richard Ward.<br />\nLoman's two over-thirty sons are the<br />\nfocus of his dreams. He's lived his life for<br />\nthem that they might shine like two quite<br />\nnoble stars. Hap, the younger, is, like<br />\nWilly, a lackey in business. Ever ready<br />\nwith euphemisms instead of progress, he<br />\nin a<br />\nis the assistant to the assistant buyer<br />\ngirls<br />\nwith<br />\nmerchandising store. He's fast<br /><br />\nand has a pad in the city, but even Willy<br />\nknows he's going nowhere.<br />\nBiff, the elder son, was a high school<br />\nfootball hero and his father's pride and<br />\njoy. Those were the good old days and,<br />\ntrue to form, Willy escapes to that<br />\nglorious past for surcease of the present's<br />\nsorrow. Throughout the play we move<br />\nfrom bleak reality to halcyon memory<br />\nand back while Miller applied layer on<br />\nlayer of irony through parallel and<br />\ncontradictory images. Biff, portrayed by<br />\nDennis Tate in the evening's most<br />\nbrilliant performance, constantly changes<br />\nhis voice and moves from swaggering kid<br />\nto troubled man time and time again. He,<br />\nlike his brother, was brought up loving<br />\nsport and outdoor work. He's wandered<br />\nfrom job to job now for 17 years never<br />\nstaying anywhere long enough to rise<br />\nbecause: \"I never could take orders from<br />\nanyone. You tilled me so full of bull...I<br />\nhad to be boss in two weeks.\"<br />\nWrong Dream<br />\nHe's finding out who he is. By the last<br />\nact, he has realized that his father sold<br />\nhappiness for the wrong dream. A Loman<br />\ncan't be great among the giants. Biff, it<br />\nbecomes clear, will learn to accept<br />\nhimself. Hap will continue in his father's<br />\nfootsteps, selling himself on success that<br />\nwill never materialize.<br />\nThe Center Stage production of Death<br />\nof a Salesman is an excellent one, not<br />\nonly because the all-black cast creates a<br />\ntotally different atmosphere, equally<br />\ncredible, for the play, but also because<br />\nthe actors are good, the direction and<br />\ntechnical matters competently done, and<br />\nthe ambience comfortable.<br /><br />\nThe presence of violations of the city housing code<br />\nin University-owned apartment buildings is as much<br />\nthe fault of tenant apathy to these conditions as it is<br />\nthe fault of the University. Vidlations of the housing<br />\ncode do exist in University housing and nothing is<br />\nbeing done to correct the conditions. University<br />\nofficials have stated that they are unaware of such<br />\nviolations and have not received tenant complaints<br />\nconcerning the conditions. Tenant committee leaders<br />\nindicate that tenants are not willing to voice their<br />\ncomplaints because, in the past, the University has<br />\nfailed to respond.<br /><br />\n\"Isn't There Some<br />\nSimple Word For All Th,at ?\"<br /><br />\nIt is only logical that if poor conditions are not<br />\nreported, the University will not recognize and remedy<br />\nthem. Tenants in University housing must not use the<br />\nexcuse of past failure to justify their inaction. Tenant<br />\ncommittees represent a viable means of voicing<br />\ncomplaints and getting effective action. More tenant<br />\ncommittee meetings should be scheduled to give<br />\ntenants the opportunity to participate in up-grading<br />\ntheir housing conditions. Violations of the city<br />\nhousing code can be directed to the city Department<br />\nof Housing and Community Development. If these<br />\nviolations were reported, the University would be<br />\nforced by law to comply with the code. In the final<br />\nestimation the University is responsible for improving<br />\nthe housing conditions, but, without a vigorous pursuit<br />\nof standard housing by the tenants, the violations may<br />\npersist.<br /><br />\nDoctors try to cheer little people at Hopkins<br /><br />\nJeanne .f-embers<br /><br />\nseifing sit Liz,<br /><br />\nhousing complaints<br /><br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThis is the first of a two-part series on<br />\nthe National Symposium on Short<br />\nStature, held at the Medical School on<br />\nApril], 1972.<br /><br />\nIt was April Fool's Day at the Hopkins<br />\nmedical school and the little people were<br />\nin town.

Inside the lecture hall, the talk of<br />\nmutations and genetics and<br />\nchondodystrophy was surrounded by an<br />\nerrie, absorbed silence.

There were more pictures for<br />\nthe audience to see, and after a while it<br />\nstopped.<br />\nThe lights went on to the sound of<br />\nobedient applause, which the speaker<br />\nacknowledged with a mild flush of<br />\nprofessional pride. The pleasant<br />\ncourtesies of succesful men were<br />\nexchanged, and the next speaker,<br />\nbehaviorist psychologist Philip Drash,<br />\ntook his rightful place at the lectern. His<br />\ntalk would be the most painful of all, but<br />\nhe seemed glibly unaware of the effect of<br />\nhis comments.<br />\nExtensive Work<br />\nHe bounded to the front, exuberant<br />\nand vigorods, a stocky man quick to tell<br />\nof his extensive work in the field, the<br />\ngrants, studies, reports, triumphs. Above<br />\nall, he was a behaviorist, and with a<br />\nconfident optimism he told the dwarves<br />\nand their parents of how the old<br />\nproblems would crumble before this new<br />\ntechnique. \"Behaviorism,\" he told the<br />\nparents, \"has been able to deal with the<br />\nproblems that the outdated tools of<br />\nreward and punishment have not been<br />\nable to reach.\" Positive reinforcement<br />\nwas the key.<br />\nSo first he would tell them about di(<br />\ndifficulties that commonly faced the<br />\ndwarf and his family as the child grew up,<br />\nand then\u2014and here at last was the<br />\nlong-sought-Answer\u2014he would take a<br />\nspecific emotional problem and show<br />\nthem how to solve it. The crowd stirred<br />\nwith expectation.<br />\nAlone in the front rows, or with their<br />\nparents, the children focused on Drash as<br />\nhe unveiled before them, in his genial<br />\nbooming voice, the upcoming obstacles<br />\nof their lives. He passed through each<br />\nphase easily, pausing only to mark down<br />\nthe stages on the blackboard, leaving<br />\nbehind each one as soon as the new<br />\nnumeral appeared on the board.

Drash compiled<br />\nwhat he felt were a series of clever retorts<br />\nthat would be useful in a variety of<br />\nsituations, and he urged parents to coach<br />\ntheir children in the art of ranking out<br />\nother children. In a report circulated<br />\noutside the lecture room, seVeral sample<br />\ninsults were listed. The bitter jokes<br />\nconveyed only panic and isolation.<br />\nYou imagined the parents shouting out<br />\nmock insults to their bewildered child<br />\nacross the living-room floor. The family<br />\nwould shield themselves within the walls<br />\nof their home; the ridicule outside could<br />\nbe tempered in these rehearsals for life.<br /><br />\nDrash in addition, also included more<br />\nserious retorts for adult use. But the<br />\nnecessity of even compiling helpful<br />\nresponses revealed the surprising depth of<br />\nhuman cruelty. A demented burlesque<br />\nact was being played out in schoolyards<br />\nthroughout the nation, and the fall-guys<br />\nwanted the show to end.<br />\nThe hope of Drash's talk, however, was<br />\nthe behaviorist approach. The fine<br />\npromise of the doctor's opening remarks<br />\nlingered in the back of everyone's mind.<br />\nGlancing at his watch, he began to<br />\nexplain the general method\u2014setting the<br />\ngoal, charting progress, using<br />\nreinforcers\u2014and then he prepared to<br />\ndiscuss psychologically-based reading<br />\nproblems. He started to elaborate,<br />\nwithout becoming specific, slowly<br />\ncircling the issue, while the entire crowd,<br />\nparents and doctors and dwarves, listened<br />\nwith a breathless intensity. Some felt a<br />\nmounting sense of outrage, of denial, of<br />\nbeing suckers in some elaborate joke.<br />\nDrash stumbled on, ignorant of the<br />\ntension, descending now then into<br />\nblessed detail, until, finally, he<br />\nannounced, \"Well, I guess my time is<br />\nabout up.\" He had left them on edge.<br />\nOf course, it was your own<br />\nimagination.

All-American<br />\nattackman Jay Connor, the<br />\nhighest scorer in Virginia lacrosse<br /><br />\nhistory, easily fooled Blue Jay<br />\ngoalie Les Matthews by flipping a<br />\nshot to the opposite side of the<br />\nnet after coming from behind the<br />\ncrease from his right side.<br />\nHopkins midfielder Rick<br />\nKowalchuk knotted the count at<br />\n12:57 of the period by beating<br />\ndefender Ted Coburn before<br />\nDoug Cooper put the Cavaliers<br />\nback on top by converting a<br />\nscreen shot on a Connor feed<br />\nbarely a minute later.

Thomas planted his<br />\nframe near the sideline past the<br />\nrestraining line on the northeast<br />\nside of the field, waiting for<br />\nfreshman defender Ed Spencer to<br />\ncommit himself. Spencer was<br />\ncontent to stay eight to ten yards<br />\noff the super-sophomore as<br />\nThomas stood immobile to run<br />\nseven and one half minutes off<br />\nthe clock.
