This unspeakable<br />\nachievement came to light while I was<br />\ncutting out the now familiar smile of Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire to add to my collection<br />\nof Wickwire memorabilia that already<br />\nblankets the walls of my study. (All I<br />\nneed -now are a few more letters from<br />\n\"Tricky Dick\" Oles, written with that<br />\nmordant wit that has sent East Coast<br />\nElitists fleeing to the refuge of their<br />\nMassachusetts mothers, to make my<br />\ncollection of the -Great Names of Johns<br />\nHopkins\" complete.)<br />\nYour recognition of Vice-President<br />\nBenton has been well deserved.

They forget<br />\n*rat Bentkmis slcilltul manipulation of tile<br />\n//hr.<br />\nConsider his statement that adding<br />\n<br />\nmore lights to the campus would not cut<br />\ndown on the number of rapes committed<br />\nat The Hopkin\u00a7. Since it is equally<br />\napparent that maintaining the present<br />\nlighting system would only lead to a<br />\ncontinuance of the present rate of rape (3<br />\nattempts in 6 months), the inference to<br />\nbe drawn from the VP's statement is that<br />\nthe lights at Hopkins should be removed<br />\nfor our own good. Having pointed out the<br />\ninherent wisdom of the former Dean's<br />\nremarks with respect to security<br />\nmeasures, I do not believe it is necessary<br />\nto dwell upon the obviously substantial<br />\nfinancial savings that would result from<br />\nthe implementation of such a plan.<br />\nDisplays of vision and imagination are<br />\nrare in public life, but Vice-President<br />\nBenton's abilities are, due to your efforts,<br />\nnow known by all.

First, the<br />\nMarine Mammal Council comprises a<br />\n' group of scientists which is housed in but<br />\nnot part of, the National Museum of<br />\nNatural History, Smithsonian Institution.<br />\nThe Council was formed a couple of years<br />\nago for the purpose of writing an<br />\nintegrated research proposal as a part of<br />\nthe International Biological Program. I<br />\nam the Program Director and the<br />\nproposal went before the National<br />\nScience Foundation last fall from The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nSecondly, the appointments to the<br />\nMarine Mammal Commission to be made<br />\nby President Nixon are to be drawn from,<br />\na list of six, not five names. The Marine<br />\nMammal Protection Act of 1972 created<br />\na moratorium on all activities with regard<br />\nto wild marine mammals, including<br />\nresearch, as of December 22, 1972. It is<br />\nregrettable that President Nixon has to<br />\ndate no appointed the Commission and so<br />\nthere is no permanent guideline for<br />\nmarine mammal conservation at present,<br />\nonly interim agreements which have been<br />\npublished in the Federal Register.<br />\n<br />\nI was quoted correctly in saying that<br />\nmanagement is a basic conservation<br />\npractice. Management includes protection<br />\nand,. environmental matters which insure<br />\nthat habitats remain healthy. It is also<br />\ntrue .that some managers are involved in<br />\nthe regulation of exploitation. However,<br />\n-protectionist\" conservationists have<br />\nstated that they are opposed to<br />\nmanagement, thinking it wholly an<br />\narrogant, unexploitive matter. I am .not<br />\nparticularly disturbed about this as it is<br />\nonly a matter of education before the<br />\nterm \"management\" becomes more clear<br />\nto them; that, in fact, wildlife<br />\nmanagement is what also saved the snowy<br />\negret and whooping crane. It is significant<br />\nthat the extremist protectionists never<br />\nwere joined in the battles in Congress last<br />\nyear with regard to marine mammals by<br />\nmost conservation groups. Whereas the<br />\nFund for Animals and Friends of Animals<br />\noppose a management bill as \"weak\", we<br />\nopposed a protectionist bill also as<br />\n\"weak\". I do not want to belabor this<br />\npoint, but ort\\y wish to point out that the<br />\n(a<br />\nprofessional socitty) were also opposed<br />\n117<br />\n//afite<br />\n<br />\nAL/<br />\n<br />\nlagC111C11i<br />\n<br />\n/1-1 11 IC<br />\n<br />\nto the protectionist philosophy.<br />\nI think the major \"hang-up\" is that<br />\nprotection considers only the harassment<br />\nand killing of animals whereas<br />\nmanagement concerns the entire suite of<br />\nenvironmental and population problems<br />\nthat beset all living things. The latter is a<br />\nsophisticated and complex approach,<br />\ndifficult to sell as we all know.<br />\nOnce again, my compliments to the<br />\nNews-Letter and to Mr. Paulus for his<br />\ntreatment of this difficult subject.<br />\n<br />\nBy ARTIE K.

Wyke has summoned Milo<br />\n<br />\nto his estate in order (he claims) to allow<br />\nthe suave stud to take his wife off his<br />\nhands. Why? Because \"she converses like<br />\na child of six, and makes love like an<br />\nextinct shellfish..!\"<br />\nSo much for exposition. The rest of<br />\nSleuth is a series of surprises and<br />\n<br />\ndeceptions that must be seen and<br />\nappreciated by everyone who enjoys good<br />\ncomedy, good mystery, skillful direction<br />\nand unexcelled acting. Joseph L.<br />\nMankiewicz has filmed Anthony Shaffer's<br />\nBroadway hit with a fine, understated<br />\nattentiveness to Olivier, Caine, and the<br />\nengaging knickknacks that crowd Wyke's<br />\nbaronial dwelling. Sleuth stays in and<br />\naround the house for almost 150 minutes,<br />\nbut thanks to Mankiewicz's intelligent<br />\ntreatment of his material, a slow moment<br />\nnever occurs. Shaffer's dialogue is<br />\ngenerally hilarious, and MankieiNicz never<br />\nattempts forcing it into the background<br />\nwith distracting visual tricks. His camera<br />\nvery subtly highlights and compliments<br />\nthe dramatic action, and \"sees\" with a<br />\ngreat deal of wit-notice, for example, the<br />\nallusion to Hitchcock (a director whose<br />\nfilms are certainly appropriate to the<br />\nmystery genre) in the shot of Milo's hand<br />\ntrailing up a bannister.<br />\nCome To Life<br />\nFew people would deny that Laurence<br />\nOlivier is the greatest actor in the world,<br />\nfewer will deny it after seeing Sleuth.<br />\nWyke is a hammy, playful egotist<br />\nthroughout most of the film, and Olivier<br />\nanimates the character with countless<br />\ngestures. smirks. grimaces, jigs, and of<br />\ncourse his magnificient voice, breaking<br />\nout into different dialects, filling the<br />\nslightest casual expression with endless<br />\nlife. Michael Caine has always been a<br />\ngood actor. but Carter, Palmer, and Alfie<br />\nhave demanded little more than deadpan<br />\nequanimity and a good sense of timing. In<br />\nOlivier's company, and with Shaffer's<br />\nscreenplay, Caine really comes to life.<br />\nAs if these two performances weren't<br />\nenough, the introduction of Alec<br />\nCawthorne as Inspector Doppler only<br />\n<br />\nfurther improves the cast.

This unspeakable<br />\nachievement came to light while I was<br />\ncutting out the now familiar smile of Dr.<br />\nChester Wickwire to add to my collection<br />\nof Wickwire memorabilia that already<br />\nblankets the walls of my study. (All I<br />\nneed -now are a few more letters from<br />\n\"Tricky Dick\" Oles, written with that<br />\nmordant wit that has sent East Coast<br />\nElitists fleeing to the refuge of their<br />\nMassachusetts mothers, to make my<br />\ncollection of the -Great Names of Johns<br />\nHopkins\" complete.)<br />\nYour recognition of Vice-President<br />\nBenton has been well deserved. Those<br />\nwho criticize your judgment on the<br />\ngrounds that Benton has done nothing for<br />\nthis school are out of order. They forget<br />\n*rat Bentkmis slcilltul manipulation of tile<br />\n//hr.<br />\nConsider his statement that adding<br /><br />\nmore lights to the campus would not cut<br />\ndown on the number of rapes committed<br />\nat The Hopkin\u00a7. Since it is equally<br />\napparent that maintaining the present<br />\nlighting system would only lead to a<br />\ncontinuance of the present rate of rape (3<br />\nattempts in 6 months), the inference to<br />\nbe drawn from the VP's statement is that<br />\nthe lights at Hopkins should be removed<br />\nfor our own good. Having pointed out the<br />\ninherent wisdom of the former Dean's<br />\nremarks with respect to security<br />\nmeasures, I do not believe it is necessary<br />\nto dwell upon the obviously substantial<br />\nfinancial savings that would result from<br />\nthe implementation of such a plan.<br />\nDisplays of vision and imagination are<br />\nrare in public life, but Vice-President<br />\nBenton's abilities are, due to your efforts,<br />\nnow known by all. All that remains to be<br />\ndone is to retire his jersey and bid<br />\nfarewell to a man whose accomplishments<br />\nat Hopkins will remain .as the standard<br />\nagainst which iv future \"greats' will be<br />\ncompa red.<br />\nStanley Snyder<br />\nClass of'74<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI wish to commend Mr. Robert Paulus<br />\non his handling of a difficult subject in<br />\nthe News-Letter on 2 February 1973<br />\nunder the title \"Animal group attacks<br />\nHopkins' Professor Ray.\" However, I<br />\nwish to clear up some points. First, the<br />\nMarine Mammal Council comprises a<br />\n' group of scientists which is housed in but<br />\nnot part of, the National Museum of<br />\nNatural History, Smithsonian Institution.<br />\nThe Council was formed a couple of years<br />\nago for the purpose of writing an<br />\nintegrated research proposal as a part of<br />\nthe International Biological Program. I<br />\nam the Program Director and the<br />\nproposal went before the National<br />\nScience Foundation last fall from The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nSecondly, the appointments to the<br />\nMarine Mammal Commission to be made<br />\nby President Nixon are to be drawn from,<br />\na list of six, not five names. The Marine<br />\nMammal Protection Act of 1972 created<br />\na moratorium on all activities with regard<br />\nto wild marine mammals, including<br />\nresearch, as of December 22, 1972. It is<br />\nregrettable that President Nixon has to<br />\ndate no appointed the Commission and so<br />\nthere is no permanent guideline for<br />\nmarine mammal conservation at present,<br />\nonly interim agreements which have been<br />\npublished in the Federal Register.<br /><br />\nI was quoted correctly in saying that<br />\nmanagement is a basic conservation<br />\npractice. Management includes protection<br />\nand,. environmental matters which insure<br />\nthat habitats remain healthy. It is also<br />\ntrue .that some managers are involved in<br />\nthe regulation of exploitation. However,<br />\n-protectionist\" conservationists have<br />\nstated that they are opposed to<br />\nmanagement, thinking it wholly an<br />\narrogant, unexploitive matter. I am .not<br />\nparticularly disturbed about this as it is<br />\nonly a matter of education before the<br />\nterm \"management\" becomes more clear<br />\nto them; that, in fact, wildlife<br />\nmanagement is what also saved the snowy<br />\negret and whooping crane. It is significant<br />\nthat the extremist protectionists never<br />\nwere joined in the battles in Congress last<br />\nyear with regard to marine mammals by<br />\nmost conservation groups. Whereas the<br />\nFund for Animals and Friends of Animals<br />\noppose a management bill as \"weak\", we<br />\nopposed a protectionist bill also as<br />\n\"weak\". I do not want to belabor this<br />\npoint, but ort\\y wish to point out that the<br />\n(a<br />\nprofessional socitty) were also opposed<br />\n117<br />\n//afite<br /><br />\nAL/<br /><br />\nlagC111C11i<br /><br />\n/1-1 11 IC<br /><br />\nto the protectionist philosophy.<br />\nI think the major \"hang-up\" is that<br />\nprotection considers only the harassment<br />\nand killing of animals whereas<br />\nmanagement concerns the entire suite of<br />\nenvironmental and population problems<br />\nthat beset all living things. The latter is a<br />\nsophisticated and complex approach,<br />\ndifficult to sell as we all know.<br />\nOnce again, my compliments to the<br />\nNews-Letter and to Mr. Paulus for his<br />\ntreatment of this difficult subject.<br /><br />\nBy ARTIE K. PONN<br />\nin a wide-brimmed black hat, blue<br />\nAs you all know, I was invited to visit bell-bottoms, and high-buttoned boots,<br />\nJohn Hopkins University last week as a seemed very concerned about grades.<br />\nperspective student in the study of \"Nobody here ever talks about marks!\"he<br />\nmedicine.

He came in and said<br />\n\"Hot enough for you?\" to Virgil and<br />\nVirgil laughed so hard he almost got sick.<br />\nI enjoy such casual \\ banter among<br />\nscholars. I met the entire Women Studies<br />\ndepartment, both of whom looked sad<br />\nabout.. something. Finally I met the<br />\nfootball coach, a lively fellow who could<br /><br />\nnot go too near the radar oven because of<br />\nhis pacemaker. All in all they were, very<br />\nsocially aware, refusing to bother each<br />\nother with conversation, even when the<br />\ncoach passed out.<br />\nVirgil said that the classic film<br />\nMagahara and the Slingshot (Tibetan,<br />\n1906) was playing for free at Levelling<br />\nHall. Virgil's interest in economics would<br />\nnever fail. On the way over he thought he<br />\nsaw a nickel in the construction area for<br />\nthe new student union (it will be a fine<br />\nplace, they have been building it for<br />\neleven years) and ran in to get it. Not<br />\nwanting to disturb him, I woke up a .<br />\nsecurity guard by tapping his crutch and<br />\nwent to the . movie by myself. I will<br />\nextrapolate on this experience, and on<br />\nmy visit to a real class and the infirmary,<br />\nin my next episode.<br /><br />\ncLE t<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nThis graduate student, Virgil Penury,<br /><br />\nwas very dedicated to the study of<br />\neconomics. He was so wrapped up in his<br />\nstudies that I'd don't think he had. time<br />\nto eat, he was so thin. And of course his<br />\nconversation must have been very<br />\ninteresting because he was saving it up the<br />\nwhole time I knew him.<br />\nFirst we visited the Faculty Club.<br />\nVirgil left his watch and fillings at the<br />\ndoor so I could go in and look around.<br />\nVirgil didn't seem to mind or know the<br />\ndifference, anyway, but kept looking<br />\ntowards the kitchen.<br />\nSeated around in differing degrees of<br />\ncontemplation were the Hopkins bright<br />\nlights of thought. One professor, dressed<br /><br />\n150 minutes with a very rich Olivier and Caine a<br />\nBy MARK CRISPINMILLER<br />\nAndrew Wyke (Laurence Olivier) is<br />\nvery rich and as British as can be. His<br />\nriches and his Britishness are<br />\ninterdependent, for his many detective<br />\nnovels, each of them describing some<br />\ninvestigative victory won by the brilliant<br />\nand aristocratic St. John Lord Merridewe.<br />\nhave all been tremendous successes over<br />\nthe years. Wyke's hero is the child of his<br />\nquirky. bright and snobbish imagination.<br /><br />\nWyke's crazy, will-bred prose. the British<br />\nideal that Wyke believes in and tries to<br />\nlive up to. The aging writer inhabits a<br />\nmansion stuffed with gimmicks an('<br />\ngames.<br />\nInto this bastion of charming and<br /><br />\nbigoted fantasy comes Milo Tyndal (ne<br />\nTindolini, played by Michael Caine). a<br />\nflashy climber who is involved with<br />\nWyke's wife. Tyndal is all cuffs., buttons,<br />\npocket-kerchief and fashionably long<br />\nhair. He represents a class of<br />\nnewly-monied swingers that Wyke finds<br />\nrepulsive, and yet in his very new-looking<br />\nblazer he seems stiff and inhibited in a<br />\nway that Wyke, the conservative bear,<br />\ncould never be. Wyke has summoned Milo<br /><br />\nto his estate in order (he claims) to allow<br />\nthe suave stud to take his wife off his<br />\nhands. Why? Because \"she converses like<br />\na child of six, and makes love like an<br />\nextinct shellfish..!\"<br />\nSo much for exposition. The rest of<br />\nSleuth is a series of surprises and<br /><br />\ndeceptions that must be seen and<br />\nappreciated by everyone who enjoys good<br />\ncomedy, good mystery, skillful direction<br />\nand unexcelled acting. Joseph L.<br />\nMankiewicz has filmed Anthony Shaffer's<br />\nBroadway hit with a fine, understated<br />\nattentiveness to Olivier, Caine, and the<br />\nengaging knickknacks that crowd Wyke's<br />\nbaronial dwelling. Sleuth stays in and<br />\naround the house for almost 150 minutes,<br />\nbut thanks to Mankiewicz's intelligent<br />\ntreatment of his material, a slow moment<br />\nnever occurs. Shaffer's dialogue is<br />\ngenerally hilarious, and MankieiNicz never<br />\nattempts forcing it into the background<br />\nwith distracting visual tricks. His camera<br />\nvery subtly highlights and compliments<br />\nthe dramatic action, and \"sees\" with a<br />\ngreat deal of wit-notice, for example, the<br />\nallusion to Hitchcock (a director whose<br />\nfilms are certainly appropriate to the<br />\nmystery genre) in the shot of Milo's hand<br />\ntrailing up a bannister.<br />\nCome To Life<br />\nFew people would deny that Laurence<br />\nOlivier is the greatest actor in the world,<br />\nfewer will deny it after seeing Sleuth.<br />\nWyke is a hammy, playful egotist<br />\nthroughout most of the film, and Olivier<br />\nanimates the character with countless<br />\ngestures. smirks. grimaces, jigs, and of<br />\ncourse his magnificient voice, breaking<br />\nout into different dialects, filling the<br />\nslightest casual expression with endless<br />\nlife. Michael Caine has always been a<br />\ngood actor. but Carter, Palmer, and Alfie<br />\nhave demanded little more than deadpan<br />\nequanimity and a good sense of timing. In<br />\nOlivier's company, and with Shaffer's<br />\nscreenplay, Caine really comes to life.<br />\nAs if these two performances weren't<br />\nenough, the introduction of Alec<br />\nCawthorne as Inspector Doppler only<br /><br />\nfurther improves the cast. It's surprising<br />\nthat an unknown actor should deliver<br />\nsuch a magnetic performance.
