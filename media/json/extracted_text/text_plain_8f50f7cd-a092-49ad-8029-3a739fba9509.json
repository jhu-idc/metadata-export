From the cramped little offices adjoining the main room, comments have been made concerning<br />\nthe untidy group that, in the course of its collective lunch,<br />\nlitters the floor with paper, and spills milk and coffee, which<br />\nform little pools on the floor. Doubtlessly some individuals<br />\nare to blame, but in the main it is not their fault. The real<br />\ntrouble is that the Barn is too small and ill equipped to serve<br />\nas a center of student life.<br />\nFor a long time there has been agitation for a real activities building, but now when a favorable opportunity seems to<br />\nhave presented itself, the campus is regarding- the project with<br />\nthe greatest indifference. When it.seemed that the plan would<br />\nbe carried out at once and work on the building would be started<br />\nprobably next tall, everyone voiced an unenthusiastic approval<br />\nand went about his business. By this time, when it seems That<br />\nthe project will be postponed fo-r a somewhat indefinite period,<br />\neverybody has forgotten about it.<br />\nWe cannot understand the indifferent attitude on the cainpus. For years an adequate students' building has been the<br />\nideal of every man in any way connected with activities. Now,<br />\nwhen it seems within reach, everyone, including the chronic<br />\nobjectors to the crowding at lunch time, and the limitations or<br />\nspace which cramp the different activities,-has--forgotten about<br />\nit.<br />\nThe University and the Y. M. C. A. can hardly be expected<br />\nto hurry in the construction of an activities building to which<br />\nthe students are indifferent. The way in which the suggestion<br />\nthat the students themselves raise money to furnish the building was received showed the apathy on the campus. The student activities council voted that any activity that wished to<br />\nwas authorized to use its surplus in furnishing its own quarters<br />\nin the new building. The raising of money to furnish the rest<br />\nof the building was decided to lie out of the scope of the council, and it recommended that the work be carried out by some<br />\nother campus organizatio.n\u2014the undergraduate Y. M. C. A.,<br />\n0. D. K.; or the Student Council. And here the matter has<br />\nrested. Nothing further has been done; not a ripple of interest<br />\nhas been aroused.<br />\nMuch regret has been expressed that activities will be<br />\nweakened, perhaps killed, by the new plan. Meanwhile, the<br />\nadministration presents a plan for a building which', will<br />\nstrengthen both activities and college life in general, and the<br />\nstudents are letting opportunities for support and co-operation<br />\nslip by.<br />\nWe would like to see the drive supported, and supported<br />\nonce.

The baseball team so<br />\nfar has had a most disastrous<br />\nseason. William and Mary and<br />\nVermont are the only teams that<br />\nhave been beaten, while Fordham<br />\nand several other colleges have<br />\nrolled up trenmendous 'scores<br />\nagainst them.

Calvert Si., Baltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., APRIL 23, 1926.<br /><br />\nA SLIPPING OPPORTUNITY<br />\nAs usual, conditions at the Barn, especially the crowding<br />\nof the second floor at noon, are the subject of a great, deal of<br />\nunfavorable criticism. From the cramped little offices adjoining the main room, comments have been made concerning<br />\nthe untidy group that, in the course of its collective lunch,<br />\nlitters the floor with paper, and spills milk and coffee, which<br />\nform little pools on the floor. Doubtlessly some individuals<br />\nare to blame, but in the main it is not their fault. The real<br />\ntrouble is that the Barn is too small and ill equipped to serve<br />\nas a center of student life.<br />\nFor a long time there has been agitation for a real activities building, but now when a favorable opportunity seems to<br />\nhave presented itself, the campus is regarding- the project with<br />\nthe greatest indifference. When it.seemed that the plan would<br />\nbe carried out at once and work on the building would be started<br />\nprobably next tall, everyone voiced an unenthusiastic approval<br />\nand went about his business. By this time, when it seems That<br />\nthe project will be postponed fo-r a somewhat indefinite period,<br />\neverybody has forgotten about it.<br />\nWe cannot understand the indifferent attitude on the cainpus. For years an adequate students' building has been the<br />\nideal of every man in any way connected with activities. Now,<br />\nwhen it seems within reach, everyone, including the chronic<br />\nobjectors to the crowding at lunch time, and the limitations or<br />\nspace which cramp the different activities,-has--forgotten about<br />\nit.<br />\nThe University and the Y. M. C. A. can hardly be expected<br />\nto hurry in the construction of an activities building to which<br />\nthe students are indifferent. The way in which the suggestion<br />\nthat the students themselves raise money to furnish the building was received showed the apathy on the campus. The student activities council voted that any activity that wished to<br />\nwas authorized to use its surplus in furnishing its own quarters<br />\nin the new building. The raising of money to furnish the rest<br />\nof the building was decided to lie out of the scope of the council, and it recommended that the work be carried out by some<br />\nother campus organizatio.n\u2014the undergraduate Y. M. C. A.,<br />\n0. D. K.; or the Student Council. And here the matter has<br />\nrested. Nothing further has been done; not a ripple of interest<br />\nhas been aroused.<br />\nMuch regret has been expressed that activities will be<br />\nweakened, perhaps killed, by the new plan. Meanwhile, the<br />\nadministration presents a plan for a building which', will<br />\nstrengthen both activities and college life in general, and the<br />\nstudents are letting opportunities for support and co-operation<br />\nslip by.<br />\nWe would like to see the drive supported, and supported<br />\nonce.

The baseball team so<br />\nfar has had a most disastrous<br />\nseason. William and Mary and<br />\nVermont are the only teams that<br />\nhave been beaten, while Fordham<br />\nand several other colleges have<br />\nrolled up trenmendous 'scores<br />\nagainst them. The lacrosse team,<br />\nhowever, demonstrated last Saturday by defeating Lafayette, 23-0,<br />\nthat it 'is not, what early season<br />\ndope stated, a weak team.
