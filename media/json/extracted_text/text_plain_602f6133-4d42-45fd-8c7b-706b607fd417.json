And the<br />\ncurrent scandal involving the<br />\nPallottine Fathers, a missionary<br />\norder with American<br />\nheadquarters in Baltimore, is one<br />\nof those times, according to the<br />\nnoted syndicated columnist,<br />\nclassicist, and outspoken critic of<br />\nthe Church.

As for Archbishop<br />\nWilliam Borders, his failure to<br />\nintervene in the matter and to<br />\npersonally investigate the<br />\nPallottines (as well as his<br />\nprejudiced judgment that the<br />\nPallottines are telling the truth<br />\nand lay employees, who alleged<br />\nsimoniacal pracitces, are lying)<br />\nwas compared by Dr. Wills to<br />\nRichard Nixon's behavior during<br />\n<br />\nthe Watergate cover-up.<br />\nDr. Wills stressed the<br />\nimportance of early Church<br />\nconcept of \"parrhesia\": total<br />\ncandor, total. outspokenness.<br />\nUsing St. Luke's Acts of the<br />\nApostles as his text, he showed<br />\nthat the early Church tried to<br />\ndifferentiate itself from the<br />\nmystery cults flourishing at the<br />\ntime by condemning magic and<br />\nesoteric pretensions of the<br />\npriesthood.

In fact, the'<br />\ncourse is aimed purely at reading,<br />\nrather than writing or<br />\nconversational skills.\"<br />\nWhile the Latin and Greek<br />\ncourses will use the convential<br />\napproaches to intensive language<br />\nstudy, the German course will<br />\nemploy a new teaching method<br />\nfirst developed by Greene, and<br />\ndetailed in his Ph.D. dissertation,<br />\nentitled Substance, Mind, and the<br />\nCategories: An Aristotelian<br />\nTheory ofLanguage.<br />\nThe method is based on the<br />\nidea that language operates by<br />\nmeans of a series of unities or<br />\ntypes of unities. These are to be<br />\nfound in the sounds of the<br />\nlanguage, the grammar, and the<br />\nvocabulary. Each language has its<br />\nown special version of them, so<br />\nthat there is no technique of<br />\ndiscovering t'\u2018em. Once<br />\nidentified, however, they can be<br />\nemployed to teach the language<br />\nmuch faster and more effectively<br />\nthan is possible by conventional<br />\nmethods.<br />\nWhen reached in Colorado,<br />\nGreene commented on the<br />\nmethod: \"The philosophical part<br />\nis this: the way we learn anything<br />\nis that the mind finds unity to a<br />\nmass of material. In languages,<br />\nthe problem is to cut across<br />\n<br />\nconventional paradigms, to<br />\nestablish what I call<br />\nsuperparadigms.<br />\n\"The method lies on an<br />\nunderstanding of how our mind<br />\nfunctions; it succeeds in<br />\ncondensing material so that it can<br />\nbe readily apprehended.

Schmiel stated \"there<br />\nseems to be a great deal of<br />\nmerest, especially from Dean<br />\nOwen's office; if this summer is<br />\nsuccessful, there is definite<br />\npossibility for expansion.

He contrasted the ease<br />\nwith which politicians may be<br />\ncontacted and the helpfulness of<br />\nCongressional staff, with the<br />\nclosed, secretive, I uncooperative<br />\ntreatment he and other<br />\njournalists had received from the<br />\nChurch authorities on this case.<br />\nThe Pallottine Fathers are<br />\nnamed after St. Vincent Pallotti,<br />\na nineteenth-century priest who<br />\ndevoted his life to aiding the<br />\npoor and easing the plight of<br />\nimmigrants. The religious order<br />\nwas originally known for working<br />\nin close cooperation with<br />\nlaymen, a practice that may be in<br />\nabeyance at the present. The<br />\nPallottines sent out 100 million<br />\npieces of mail last year, but not<br />\nto Marylanders. In fact, few<br />\nMarylanders knew of their<br />\nexistence. Fr. Guido Carcich,<br />\nwho directed the Pallottines'<br />\nfund-raising operation, has<br />\nbecome the central figure in the<br />\ncontroversy. Wills called him<br />\n\"probably just an operator after<br />\npower.\"<br />\nForgotten<br />\nThe Pallottine controversy<br />\nmay fade away, just as Nixon<br />\nvainly hoped the Watergate<br />\nscandal would be forgotten. Or it<br />\nmight be the catalyst to a new<br />\nmovement to reform the Church,<br />\nto bring it in line with the ideal<br />\nof \"parrhesia\" Wills articulated.<br />\nThe capacity crowd at the<br />\npresentation seemed actively<br />\nupset by the Pallottines' behavior<br />\nand the alleged coverup. One<br />\ndoubts that the last word will be<br />\nspoken on this matter for some<br />\ntime. Dr. Chester Wickwire asked<br />\nWills if he would encounter any<br />\ndifficulty with the Catholic<br />\nChurch as a result of his stand on<br />\nthe Pallottines. \"Lay people that<br />\nread the Scripture are always<br />\nlooked at a little askance by the<br />\nChurch,\" he jokingly replied.<br />\n<br />\nMarty talks on religion and U.S.<br />\nBy STEVE SCHULTZ<br />\nIn a talk entitled \"The<br />\nAmerican Tradition of<br />\nTomorrow\" Dr. Martin Marty,<br />\nDean of the University of<br />\nChicago Divinity School, posed<br />\nthe question, \"What is American<br />\nin religion?\"<br />\nHe pointed out the complexity<br />\nand irony of such a quest in our<br />\nsociety. Dr. Marty spoke of the<br />\nAmerican experience as having<br />\nbeen molded by heterogeneous<br />\nsocial and religious groups with<br />\nlittle attention given to tradition.<br />\nHe cited five dimensions which<br />\nhave shaped the American nation<br />\nboth religiously and spiritually:<br />\npluralism, experimentalism,<br />\nscripturalism, the Enlightenment,<br />\nand voluntaryism. Stating that<br />\nour heritage has been one of<br />\n\"change under principles of<br />\nnon-change,\" he quoted the<br />\nfamous French observer of the<br />\nAmerican \"experiment\"<br />\nAlexander de Tocqueville: \"there<br />\nexists a singular fixity of certain<br />\n<br />\nprinciples...they love change but<br />\ndread revolution.\"<br />\nThough he viewed<br />\nscripturalism as a dynamic force<br />\ngoverning innovation, he did<br />\nwarn of \"constrictive norms\"<br />\nwhich have resulted in \"the<br />\nIndian being wiped out and the<br />\nblack man enslaved.\" While each<br />\nreligious sect who immigrated to<br />\nAmerica came with the notion<br />\nthat they had \"the script,\" Dr.<br />\nMarty found \"substantial shifts\"<br />\nas evidenced by the separation of<br />\nchurch and ,state.<br />\n!Directions<br />\nLooking into the future, he<br />\nsaw two possible directions for<br />\nmovement, both departing from<br />\nthe American credo \"e pluribus<br />\nun urn.\" The first is a<br />\n\"disparaging of variety, plures,<br />\nand a working toward unum\"<br />\nending in a \"planned society\"<br />\nwith substantial loss of freedoms<br />\nnow taken for granted. The other<br />\nand more likely possibility,<br />\naccording to Dr. Marty, is a<br />\n<br />\n\"meaningless individualism...a<br />\nreligion of high-rise apartments.\"<br />\nIn this latter society, there will<br />\nbe a \"loss of power of<br />\nintermediate associations and<br />\nsupportive groups, the school,<br />\nthe family, and the church.\" This<br />\n\"do your own thing\"- philosophy,<br />\nhe pointed out, is easily<br />\nobservable today.<br />\nRemaining \"cautiously<br />\ncptimistic,\" Dr. Marty proposed<br />\nthat, \"we accept as the heart of<br />\nour tradition, the part of<br />\nscriptures which speaks to us in<br />\nthe present, e pluribus unum, a<br />\ncommunity of subcommittees\u2014a<br />\nfreedom which avails us to work<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\nFollowing the lecture, he was<br />\nasked to assess the trend toward<br />\nmixing politics and religion in<br />\nthis Presidential election year.<br />\nRather than having these entities<br />\ninsulated from one another, Dr.<br />\nMarty welcomed what he<br />\nreferred to as \"meddling\" as a<br />\nhealthy sign.<br />\n<br />\n\fAnother voice<br />\n<br />\nTim<br />\n<br />\nNEWS4ETTER<br />\nvol. 1xxx no. 48Ituesday, april 27, 1976Ibaltimore, maryland180th year<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager.<br />\nmanaging editor.<br />\nfeatures editors.<br />\nexecutive editor<br />\nday editors.<br />\nsports editor.<br />\nphoto-production manager.<br />\nphoto editor.<br />\ncontributing editor.<br />\n<br />\nDonald Morisato, Russ Smith<br />\nDante Landucci<br />\nJoe Lob!<br />\nEric Garland, D.H.

In the most recent case, the Biology Department<br />\nA writer in the News-Letter, a<br />\nhas recognized the inadequate preparation . of some Mr. D.H.

He snidely slid<br />\nsituation.<br />\na few untargeted claims of<br />\nA more fundamental question is called into being,<br />\nirresponsible journalism under<br />\nhowever. What responsibility, if any, does the University (in your feet and claimed to clear<br />\nthe form of its constituent academic departments), have to the air around Patuxent<br />\nInstitution. \"It's all right, he<br />\nthe undergraduate student body?<br />\nStudents seem to feel that the University's departments says, \"You need not worry: 1,<br />\nshould be primarily committed to providing the best t he Writer, am<br />\nindependently-minded and<br />\npre-(medicine, law, etc.) education available. There is no everything is all right in the<br />\njustification for such reasoning. The Biology Department world.\" Eat what you wish, dear<br />\ndoes not exist for the convenience of pre-meds.

One can easily reeks of the odor of spoiled<br />\nsympathize with the Biology Department's position: it is souls. Even stronger language has<br />\nafter all, the closest thing to a pre-med department on been heard. Spoiled souls also<br />\nwander on the outside: those<br />\ncampus. What, is needed, however, is some type of who evade the rotting,<br />\nintroductory, unified presentation of biological concepts,- as corpuscularsmell that sometimes<br />\nwell as an integration of the social implications of current is the \u2022 truth; those who costume<br />\nresearch, for non-science majors. The problem is not unique themselves in the robes of a sage<br />\nto this department alone. If the University is to_establish any but actually are lying from<br />\nwithin their soiled nightgown.<br />\nunity between- specialized academic disciplines, its students<br />\nPatuxent Institution, you may<br />\nmust come to appreciate the interrelationships which exist be reminded, exemplifies The<br />\nbetween seemingly unrelated pieces of knowledge.<br />\nPrison.

It is,<br />\nnevertheless, a prison. Go out<br />\nand take a look at it. A man is<br />\nsent to Patuxent by the courts;<br />\nonly the courts or Patuxent can<br />\nrelease .him. He is sent there<br />\nindeterminately, so the<br />\nInstitution can work its ways on<br />\nhim under no pressure of time;<br />\nand the man can sit. and take a<br />\ngood look at himself, under all<br />\nthe pressure of all time. A man's<br />\ntime in Patuxent has no reference<br />\nto the sentence as imposed in a<br />\nCoUrt of Law. The rules within<br />\nPatuxent are set by The<br />\nInstitution itself.<br />\nNow, the Writer in the<br />\nNews-Letter, April 9, 1976, set<br />\nhimself the task of \"clearing the<br />\nair\" and only fouled it more. His<br />\nsole source of information<br />\nconsisted of speaking with two<br />\nlawyers in the Public Defenders<br />\nOffice.<br />\nHe did not speak with<br />\nprisoners, ex-prisoners, guards,<br />\nLegal Aid lawyers\u2014no informant<br />\npossibly familiar with life as it is<br />\nin Patuxent. Other than the two<br />\nlawyers, of course.<br />\nI also spoke with one of those<br />\ntwo lawyers. Two points struck<br />\nme from the conversation. One,<br />\nthe lawyer,\u2022being a nice guy, was<br />\nwilling to change his tune as<br />\nvarious points were made. Two,<br />\nwhat he initially said sounded \u2022<br />\nsuspiciously similar to exactly<br />\nwhat was printed under the<br />\nWriter's name in the News-Letter.<br />\nA tape recorder can quote; a<br />\nwriter is, hopefully, not<br />\nmechanical.<br />\nThe News-Letter Writer passed<br />\nlike a flying duck over some<br />\nincredible points. Such as how a<br />\nparticular prisoner happened to<br />\nbecome committed to Patuxent:<br />\nSome person got wind that Mr.<br />\nGuy would probably he coming<br />\nout and so got on the back of the<br />\nprosecuting attorney to do<br />\nsomething.<br />\nWho is that \"some person\"<br />\nand 'why?

Mr. Guy had already<br />\nserved his time under<br />\nquestionably severe sentence and<br />\nhad been a model inmate.<br />\nReferral to Patuxent ts<br />\nsupposed to be temporary; it is<br />\nnot commitment. Does our<br />\nair-conditioned Writer know<br />\nanything of men who serve time<br />\nat Patuxent beyond their original<br />\nsentences, without the<br />\nopportunity of making parole, or<br />\nof how much time is served at<br />\nPatuxent which is dead time, not<br />\ncounting as good time when the<br />\nman is released back into the<br />\nregular penal system. Call you<br />\nbelieve serving time twice? Did<br />\nhe bother .to check if there were<br />\nany reasons why Mr. Guy could<br />\nserve not only time beyond his<br />\nrelease date, but that he has now<br />\nserved 256 days in solitary<br />\nconfinement'? Did the Writer<br />\nspeak with any men who refuse<br />\nthe Patuxent behavior<br />\nmodification program and choose<br />\nsolitary confinement? Often for<br />\n.years.

Hopkins<br />\nhave to evict Ann Baker?<br />\nIf.additional student housing is aboslutely mandatory to<br />\n.<br />\nthe future of this University, then perhaps another dormitory<br />\nshould be built. But Hopkins must not steal fromi the<br />\ncommunity. Tragic incidents such as the case of Ann Baker<br />\nwill remind us all ot<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n\fPicnic<br />\nAnd what a fun day in the sun<br />\nit was! The Centennial Picnic<br />\neven brought out something we<br />\nsuspected all along: the Writing<br />\nSeminars Department has one<br />\nheck of a baseball team. Eating,<br />\ndrinking, rocking, and exercising.<br />\n.. too much.<br />\nWe think that this kind of<br />\nbringing together of the entire<br />\nHopkins co mmunityistudents,<br />\nemployees, and<br />\nfaculty,<br />\nfriends\u2014is too good to happen<br />\nonly once every hundred years.<br />\nBut since we won't have to call it<br />\n\"Centennial\" next time around,<br />\nwe can institute a few minor<br />\nadjustments. For instance, why<br />\nnot have two or more food<br />\noutlets? We'll miss the two hour<br />\nstints waiting in line with our<br />\nfavorite people, but that's the<br />\nbreaks. And why not hire<br />\nHopkins' bands? We're such a<br />\nbunch of snobs that teeny<br />\n\u2022 bopper rock won't cut it for us.<br />\nAs an off the cuff suggestion,<br />\nwhat about those guys who we<br />\njust haven't seen enough of this<br />\nyear? Something Rose, right?!<br />\nYup, it could be another great<br />\nday next year, and every year.<br />\nWe need all the events they can<br />\ndig up for us(and more) to get us<br />\nout of our study holes.

RICHARD MACKSEY<br />\nAdmirers of Martin Scorsese's<br />\nTaxi Driver and Alice will have<br />\nan opportunity tonight to see<br />\nwhere the award-winning young<br />\ndirector comes from. The Film<br />\nWorkshop will preitnt two<br />\nperformances of his Mean Streets<br />\nin Shriver at 7:30 and 9:30 this<br />\nevening. The 'most personal of<br />\nScorsese's works to date, Mean<br />\nStreets was judged the best film<br />\nof the eleventh New York Film<br />\nFestival and provoked Pauline<br />\nKael to call it \"a true original of<br />\nour period. . . a blood thriller in<br />\nthe truest sense.\"<br />\nHarvey Keitel plays the<br />\nanti-hero loosely based on<br />\nScorsese's own memories of<br />\ngrowing up in Little Italy, a<br />\nportrait of the film-maker as<br />\nyoung mafioso. Robert De Niro<br />\nwon the New York Film Critics'<br />\nAward for his bravura<br />\nperformance as the flamboyant<br />\nfoil to Keitel's cautious hood.<br />\nScorsese's camera explores with<br />\nextraordinary fluidity the gritty,<br />\nlurid world of their cut-rate<br />\ninferno, bounded by the Bowery,<br />\nChinatown, and the<br />\nVillage<br />\nFrom the opening tracking shot<br />\n<br />\nof the neighborhood bar to the<br />\nharrowing last minutes of gun<br />\nplay, the director keeps the film<br />\nclose to the taste and feel of the<br />\nmean streets that the taxi driver<br />\ncruises through. The operatic<br />\nforce of the pop soundtrack and<br />\nthe vitality of De Niro's<br />\nperformance help to focus the<br />\nimprovisatory technique of the<br />\nacting.<br />\nFunny<br />\nDespite the grit and the gore,<br />\n. Mean Streets is a very funny<br />\nfilm, with familiar types caught<br />\nfrom absurd angles. Without<br />\nimpeding the action, Scorsese<br />\nmanages to explore a theme<br />\nnever completely achieved in The<br />\nGodfather\u2014the complex<br />\npsychological play between<br />\nbaroque religiosity and \"family\"<br />\ncrime. Joseph Gelmis touches on<br />\nsome of the Dantesque lights in<br />\nthe film: \"Marty Scorsese is a<br />\nmajor talent. His cameras can<br />\nmake a stroll through a garish bar<br />\nlook like a tour of hell, with the<br />\ndamned fouls brawling, boozing,<br />\neven killing each other.

The<br />\nprotagonists in this contest were<br />\nBilly Jones of Hopkins and<br />\nDennis Compton of Washington.<br />\nThrough the first four innings<br />\nof the game, neither pitcher<br />\nallowed a base-hit. The visiting<br />\nShomen finally broke the spell<br />\nwith a pair of singles in the top<br />\nof the fifth, but Jones was able<br />\nto easily subdue this Washington<br />\nscoring effort.<br />\nThe Jays got their first safeties<br />\nof the afternoon in the bottom<br />\nof the sixth, but also proved<br />\nunable to score and the game<br />\nmoved into the seventh inning.<br />\nAs each contest in a<br />\ndoubleheader is only a regulation<br />\nseven innings, extra frames<br />\nbecame a distinct possibility.<br />\nHowever, Hopkins eliminated<br />\nthat chance in the bottom of the<br />\nseventh. Dave Emala was hit by a<br />\npitched ball and then moved up<br />\nto second on a wild pitch.<br />\nFollowing a walk to Duffy, Scott<br />\ngrounded a single to left,<br />\nenabling Emala to score and thus<br />\nending the game.<br />\nEach of the pitchers ended up<br />\nhaving surrendered only three<br />\nhits. Jones, however, had the<br />\nsuperior outing, striking out nine<br />\nand giving up no walks.<br />\nThe Jays did not wait quite as<br />\nlong to decide the second game.<br />\nSingles by Babb, Emala, Lewing.<br />\n<br />\nand Duffy produced three runs<br />\nand proved to be all of the<br />\noffense that was needed.<br />\nMeanwhile, Hopkins hurlers<br />\n<br />\nChuck Lachenbruch and Billy<br />\nJones (working in relief)<br />\ncombined to hole the visitors to<br />\ntwo hits and one unearned run.<br />\n<br />\nBIA beat continues<br />\nBy PHILIP A.

All that remains are the<br />\nfew lacrosse and softball games<br />\nthat need to be made up after<br />\nbeing postponed, according to<br />\nthe new schedules that came out<br />\nlast week.<br />\nAs far as lacrosse goes, ATO<br />\nhas come out strong to lead the<br />\nfrat league with a perfect 5-0<br />\nrecord. First place in the three<br />\nindependent leagues are held by<br />\nLinguini Garbage Removal, 5-0,<br />\nHermition Operators and Genies,<br />\n3-1 (tie), and Meddies, 4-0.<br />\nPlayoffs among the top team in<br />\neach of the four leagues will<br />\nbegin this Thursday, April 29,<br />\nwith the finals on Tuesday, May<br />\n4.<br />\nThe swimming tournament last<br />\nmonth featured a grueling<br />\nfraternity competition, which<br />\nwas not decided until the final<br />\nre ay.

These awards culminate the<br />\nyear's activities by recognizing<br />\noverall success and achievement<br />\nin athletics. As things stand now,<br />\nit looks like DU will upset the<br />\nincumbent, TEP, by 100 trophy<br />\npoints, while Wilson-Wood will<br />\nrepeat, having a comfortable 150<br />\npoint cushion over Hollander.<br />\nThe BIA has also been electing<br />\nnew officers and members. Next<br />\nyear's president is Shaun<br />\nHedman; recording secretary<br />\nTom Locraft; and corresponding<br />\nsecretary Philip Gilly.<br />\n<br />\nBrown scored three<br />\nconsecutive, unanswered goals<br />\nwithin tlie first three minutes of<br />\nthe third quarter to cut the Jays<br />\nlead to 9-7. The formula looked<br />\nfamiliar as Tom Rothman, Mike<br />\nEvans and John Meister all tallied<br />\nunassisted following Bill Ohlsen's<br />\ndomination of the first three<br />\nface-offs of the second half for<br />\nthe Ivy Leaguers.<br />\nFortunately a Hopkins<br />\ntime-out seemed to rectify the<br />\nsituation as the Blue Jays<br />\nblanked the Bruins foi the rest of<br />\nthe quarter while scoring three<br />\ngoals themselves, restoring their<br />\nlead to a comfortable 12-7. Mike<br />\nO'Neill, the Massapequa native<br />\nreturning home, had a hand in all<br />\nthree, scoring the first solo and<br />\nthen assisting on tallies by<br />\nWittelsberger (his fourth) and<br />\nKohler.<br />\nFrom then on it was all<br />\nHopkins as the closest the Rhode<br />\nIslanders could get was four goals<br />\nat 14-10. From there Hopkins<br />\nscored six straight in the last six<br />\nminutes to account for the final<br />\n20-10 total.<br />\nIn assessing the Jays highest<br />\nscoring output_ of the season, the<br />\nobvious place to bestow praise is<br />\nupon the offense and deservedly<br />\nso. The attack. led by Richie<br />\nHirsch's three goals and four<br />\nassits, combined for ten goals and<br />\nfive assists. Wittelsberger had<br />\nfour and one while O'Neill had<br />\ntwo scores and Zimmermannotched one and three, as the<br />\nmidfield was well represented ill<br />\nthe scorebook as well. Steve Wey,<br />\nJoe Devlin, and Bob Maimone<br />\neach had one goal while Huntley<br />\nand Greg Cunningham each had<br />\nan assist to round out the<br />\nscoring.<br />\nBut if one player's<br />\nperformance had to be<br />\nhighlighted then it was the<br />\nsh owing of goaltender Kevin<br />\nMahon. Brown outshot Hopkins<br />\n57-56 but Mahon's incredible<br />\ntotal of 24 saves as well as his<br />\nbrilliant play out of the nets<br />\nlimited the Bruins to only ten<br />\ngoals.<br />\n<br />\nACCOUNTING AND<br />\nFINANCE MAJORS<br />\nAED Speaker Series<br />\npresents<br />\nDr. Peter Tuteur from<br />\nWashington University<br />\nSchool of Medicine<br />\n<br />\nLET US HELP YOU TO<br />\nBECOME A CPA<br />\n<br />\nCPA<br />\nREVIEW<br />\n<br />\nwill speak on<br />\nMedical School Admissions<br />\nWednesday, April 28 @ 7:30 p.m.<br />\nin the L.V. room<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\nWASHINGTON<br />\nD.C.<br />\n<br />\n301 837-8442<br />\n202331.1410<br />\n<br />\nCOURSES BEGIN MAY 26 8.

And the<br />\ncurrent scandal involving the<br />\nPallottine Fathers, a missionary<br />\norder with American<br />\nheadquarters in Baltimore, is one<br />\nof those times, according to the<br />\nnoted syndicated columnist,<br />\nclassicist, and outspoken critic of<br />\nthe Church. The Pallottines'<br /><br />\nmisleading fund-raising letters;<br />\ntheir secretive withholding of<br />\nfunds collected to preach the<br />\ngospel and aid the poor; their<br />\nchanneling of these funds into<br />\nreal estate investments and loans<br />\nto Governor Marvin Mandel; their<br />\ndiscarding of letters requesting<br />\nmasses to be said which were not<br />\naccompanied by at least $10\u2014for<br />\nthese practices, the Pallottines<br />\nmay very well be guilty of<br />\nsimony (the selling of spiritual<br /><br />\noffices for material gain), as that<br />\nterm was clarified by St. Thomas<br />\nAquinas. As for Archbishop<br />\nWilliam Borders, his failure to<br />\nintervene in the matter and to<br />\npersonally investigate the<br />\nPallottines (as well as his<br />\nprejudiced judgment that the<br />\nPallottines are telling the truth<br />\nand lay employees, who alleged<br />\nsimoniacal pracitces, are lying)<br />\nwas compared by Dr. Wills to<br />\nRichard Nixon's behavior during<br /><br />\nthe Watergate cover-up.<br />\nDr. Wills stressed the<br />\nimportance of early Church<br />\nconcept of \"parrhesia\": total<br />\ncandor, total. outspokenness.<br />\nUsing St. Luke's Acts of the<br />\nApostles as his text, he showed<br />\nthat the early Church tried to<br />\ndifferentiate itself from the<br />\nmystery cults flourishing at the<br />\ntime by condemning magic and<br />\nesoteric pretensions of the<br />\npriesthood.

In fact, the'<br />\ncourse is aimed purely at reading,<br />\nrather than writing or<br />\nconversational skills.\"<br />\nWhile the Latin and Greek<br />\ncourses will use the convential<br />\napproaches to intensive language<br />\nstudy, the German course will<br />\nemploy a new teaching method<br />\nfirst developed by Greene, and<br />\ndetailed in his Ph.D. dissertation,<br />\nentitled Substance, Mind, and the<br />\nCategories: An Aristotelian<br />\nTheory ofLanguage.<br />\nThe method is based on the<br />\nidea that language operates by<br />\nmeans of a series of unities or<br />\ntypes of unities. These are to be<br />\nfound in the sounds of the<br />\nlanguage, the grammar, and the<br />\nvocabulary. Each language has its<br />\nown special version of them, so<br />\nthat there is no technique of<br />\ndiscovering t'\u2018em. Once<br />\nidentified, however, they can be<br />\nemployed to teach the language<br />\nmuch faster and more effectively<br />\nthan is possible by conventional<br />\nmethods.<br />\nWhen reached in Colorado,<br />\nGreene commented on the<br />\nmethod: \"The philosophical part<br />\nis this: the way we learn anything<br />\nis that the mind finds unity to a<br />\nmass of material. In languages,<br />\nthe problem is to cut across<br /><br />\nconventional paradigms, to<br />\nestablish what I call<br />\nsuperparadigms.<br />\n\"The method lies on an<br />\nunderstanding of how our mind<br />\nfunctions; it succeeds in<br />\ncondensing material so that it can<br />\nbe readily apprehended. Usually,<br />\na language is taught in a very<br />\nhaphazard way, involving blind<br />\nrepetitions.<br />\n\"Now if a subject has any<br />\nunification, all other<br />\ncompartments can be applied<br />\naround this nucleus.

Each class will be no<br />\nlarger than fifteen students.<br />\nThe possibility of offering<br />\nFrench and Italian is also being<br />\nconsidered. Schmiel stated \"there<br />\nseems to be a great deal of<br />\nmerest, especially from Dean<br />\nOwen's office; if this summer is<br />\nsuccessful, there is definite<br />\npossibility for expansion. This<br />\ndepends of course, on such<br />\nfactors as funding.\"<br /><br />\nElections<br /><br />\ncharges-, and that he would ask<br />\nthe accused Pallottines if the<br />\nallegations were true.<br />\nWills then cited canon law to<br />\nshow that the archbishop did<br />\nhave the power,even the duty, to<br />\nintervene, to investigate, and to<br />\nspeak out. He contrasted the ease<br />\nwith which politicians may be<br />\ncontacted and the helpfulness of<br />\nCongressional staff, with the<br />\nclosed, secretive, I uncooperative<br />\ntreatment he and other<br />\njournalists had received from the<br />\nChurch authorities on this case.<br />\nThe Pallottine Fathers are<br />\nnamed after St. Vincent Pallotti,<br />\na nineteenth-century priest who<br />\ndevoted his life to aiding the<br />\npoor and easing the plight of<br />\nimmigrants. The religious order<br />\nwas originally known for working<br />\nin close cooperation with<br />\nlaymen, a practice that may be in<br />\nabeyance at the present. The<br />\nPallottines sent out 100 million<br />\npieces of mail last year, but not<br />\nto Marylanders. In fact, few<br />\nMarylanders knew of their<br />\nexistence. Fr. Guido Carcich,<br />\nwho directed the Pallottines'<br />\nfund-raising operation, has<br />\nbecome the central figure in the<br />\ncontroversy. Wills called him<br />\n\"probably just an operator after<br />\npower.\"<br />\nForgotten<br />\nThe Pallottine controversy<br />\nmay fade away, just as Nixon<br />\nvainly hoped the Watergate<br />\nscandal would be forgotten. Or it<br />\nmight be the catalyst to a new<br />\nmovement to reform the Church,<br />\nto bring it in line with the ideal<br />\nof \"parrhesia\" Wills articulated.<br />\nThe capacity crowd at the<br />\npresentation seemed actively<br />\nupset by the Pallottines' behavior<br />\nand the alleged coverup. One<br />\ndoubts that the last word will be<br />\nspoken on this matter for some<br />\ntime. Dr. Chester Wickwire asked<br />\nWills if he would encounter any<br />\ndifficulty with the Catholic<br />\nChurch as a result of his stand on<br />\nthe Pallottines. \"Lay people that<br />\nread the Scripture are always<br />\nlooked at a little askance by the<br />\nChurch,\" he jokingly replied.<br /><br />\nMarty talks on religion and U.S.<br />\nBy STEVE SCHULTZ<br />\nIn a talk entitled \"The<br />\nAmerican Tradition of<br />\nTomorrow\" Dr. Martin Marty,<br />\nDean of the University of<br />\nChicago Divinity School, posed<br />\nthe question, \"What is American<br />\nin religion?\"<br />\nHe pointed out the complexity<br />\nand irony of such a quest in our<br />\nsociety. Dr. Marty spoke of the<br />\nAmerican experience as having<br />\nbeen molded by heterogeneous<br />\nsocial and religious groups with<br />\nlittle attention given to tradition.<br />\nHe cited five dimensions which<br />\nhave shaped the American nation<br />\nboth religiously and spiritually:<br />\npluralism, experimentalism,<br />\nscripturalism, the Enlightenment,<br />\nand voluntaryism. Stating that<br />\nour heritage has been one of<br />\n\"change under principles of<br />\nnon-change,\" he quoted the<br />\nfamous French observer of the<br />\nAmerican \"experiment\"<br />\nAlexander de Tocqueville: \"there<br />\nexists a singular fixity of certain<br /><br />\nprinciples...they love change but<br />\ndread revolution.\"<br />\nThough he viewed<br />\nscripturalism as a dynamic force<br />\ngoverning innovation, he did<br />\nwarn of \"constrictive norms\"<br />\nwhich have resulted in \"the<br />\nIndian being wiped out and the<br />\nblack man enslaved.\" While each<br />\nreligious sect who immigrated to<br />\nAmerica came with the notion<br />\nthat they had \"the script,\" Dr.<br />\nMarty found \"substantial shifts\"<br />\nas evidenced by the separation of<br />\nchurch and ,state.<br />\n!Directions<br />\nLooking into the future, he<br />\nsaw two possible directions for<br />\nmovement, both departing from<br />\nthe American credo \"e pluribus<br />\nun urn.\" The first is a<br />\n\"disparaging of variety, plures,<br />\nand a working toward unum\"<br />\nending in a \"planned society\"<br />\nwith substantial loss of freedoms<br />\nnow taken for granted. The other<br />\nand more likely possibility,<br />\naccording to Dr. Marty, is a<br /><br />\n\"meaningless individualism...a<br />\nreligion of high-rise apartments.\"<br />\nIn this latter society, there will<br />\nbe a \"loss of power of<br />\nintermediate associations and<br />\nsupportive groups, the school,<br />\nthe family, and the church.\" This<br />\n\"do your own thing\"- philosophy,<br />\nhe pointed out, is easily<br />\nobservable today.<br />\nRemaining \"cautiously<br />\ncptimistic,\" Dr. Marty proposed<br />\nthat, \"we accept as the heart of<br />\nour tradition, the part of<br />\nscriptures which speaks to us in<br />\nthe present, e pluribus unum, a<br />\ncommunity of subcommittees\u2014a<br />\nfreedom which avails us to work<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\nFollowing the lecture, he was<br />\nasked to assess the trend toward<br />\nmixing politics and religion in<br />\nthis Presidential election year.<br />\nRather than having these entities<br />\ninsulated from one another, Dr.<br />\nMarty welcomed what he<br />\nreferred to as \"meddling\" as a<br />\nhealthy sign.<br /><br />\nAnother voice<br /><br />\nTim<br /><br />\nNEWS4ETTER<br />\nvol. 1xxx no. 48Ituesday, april 27, 1976Ibaltimore, maryland180th year<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager.<br />\nmanaging editor.<br />\nfeatures editors.<br />\nexecutive editor<br />\nday editors.<br />\nsports editor.<br />\nphoto-production manager.<br />\nphoto editor.<br />\ncontributing editor.<br /><br />\nDonald Morisato, Russ Smith<br />\nDante Landucci<br />\nJoe Lob!<br />\nEric Garland, D.H.

Which is<br />\nprobably why it was dreamed up<br />\nand is maintained. This<br />\nconjecture is discussable only by<br />\nso cio-metaphysicians. Presently<br />\nIt is highly encouraging to note that student opinion, you are requested to give a<br />\nchannelled through the ,Student Council (Education second thought to the truth, or<br />\nCommittee), can have a significant impact on curricular what was presented to you as the<br />\ntruth.<br />\ndecisions. In the most recent case, the Biology Department<br />\nA writer in the News-Letter, a<br />\nhas recognized the inadequate preparation . of some Mr. D.H. Warren, claimed to<br />\nundergraduates, and taken steps toward rectifying the offer to you the truth, the<br />\nundistorted truth. He snidely slid<br />\nsituation.<br />\na few untargeted claims of<br />\nA more fundamental question is called into being,<br />\nirresponsible journalism under<br />\nhowever. What responsibility, if any, does the University (in your feet and claimed to clear<br />\nthe form of its constituent academic departments), have to the air around Patuxent<br />\nInstitution. \"It's all right, he<br />\nthe undergraduate student body?<br />\nStudents seem to feel that the University's departments says, \"You need not worry: 1,<br />\nshould be primarily committed to providing the best t he Writer, am<br />\nindependently-minded and<br />\npre-(medicine, law, etc.) education available. There is no everything is all right in the<br />\njustification for such reasoning. The Biology Department world.\" Eat what you wish, dear<br />\ndoes not exist for the convenience of pre-meds.

One can easily reeks of the odor of spoiled<br />\nsympathize with the Biology Department's position: it is souls. Even stronger language has<br />\nafter all, the closest thing to a pre-med department on been heard. Spoiled souls also<br />\nwander on the outside: those<br />\ncampus. What, is needed, however, is some type of who evade the rotting,<br />\nintroductory, unified presentation of biological concepts,- as corpuscularsmell that sometimes<br />\nwell as an integration of the social implications of current is the \u2022 truth; those who costume<br />\nresearch, for non-science majors. The problem is not unique themselves in the robes of a sage<br />\nto this department alone. If the University is to_establish any but actually are lying from<br />\nwithin their soiled nightgown.<br />\nunity between- specialized academic disciplines, its students<br />\nPatuxent Institution, you may<br />\nmust come to appreciate the interrelationships which exist be reminded, exemplifies The<br />\nbetween seemingly unrelated pieces of knowledge.<br />\nPrison. It is a \"behavior<br />\nmodification\" penal colony<br />\nerected in about 1950.<br /><br />\npre-sumptuous<br /><br />\nTheoretically advanced,<br />\nsupposedly making available all<br />\nthat a prison may need for the<br />\nrehabilitation of souls, it is<br />\nadministered not by dumb guards<br />\nbut by bright psychiatrists. It is,<br />\nnevertheless, a prison. Go out<br />\nand take a look at it. A man is<br />\nsent to Patuxent by the courts;<br />\nonly the courts or Patuxent can<br />\nrelease .him. He is sent there<br />\nindeterminately, so the<br />\nInstitution can work its ways on<br />\nhim under no pressure of time;<br />\nand the man can sit. and take a<br />\ngood look at himself, under all<br />\nthe pressure of all time. A man's<br />\ntime in Patuxent has no reference<br />\nto the sentence as imposed in a<br />\nCoUrt of Law. The rules within<br />\nPatuxent are set by The<br />\nInstitution itself.<br />\nNow, the Writer in the<br />\nNews-Letter, April 9, 1976, set<br />\nhimself the task of \"clearing the<br />\nair\" and only fouled it more. His<br />\nsole source of information<br />\nconsisted of speaking with two<br />\nlawyers in the Public Defenders<br />\nOffice.<br />\nHe did not speak with<br />\nprisoners, ex-prisoners, guards,<br />\nLegal Aid lawyers\u2014no informant<br />\npossibly familiar with life as it is<br />\nin Patuxent. Other than the two<br />\nlawyers, of course.<br />\nI also spoke with one of those<br />\ntwo lawyers. Two points struck<br />\nme from the conversation. One,<br />\nthe lawyer,\u2022being a nice guy, was<br />\nwilling to change his tune as<br />\nvarious points were made. Two,<br />\nwhat he initially said sounded \u2022<br />\nsuspiciously similar to exactly<br />\nwhat was printed under the<br />\nWriter's name in the News-Letter.<br />\nA tape recorder can quote; a<br />\nwriter is, hopefully, not<br />\nmechanical.<br />\nThe News-Letter Writer passed<br />\nlike a flying duck over some<br />\nincredible points.

Did the Writer<br />\nspeak with any men who refuse<br />\nthe Patuxent behavior<br />\nmodification program and choose<br />\nsolitary confinement? Often for<br />\n.years.

That officials such as Director of Housing Peter<br />\nHeist should be forced to painfully evict tenants only serves<br />\nto raise questions about the legitimacy of such purchases.<br />\nWhy is Hopkins buying buildings off campus? Are these<br />\nacquisitions necessary?<br />\nThe students who will occupy the Baltimorean in the fall<br />\ncould have found other housing if not presented with an easy<br />\nalternative like the Baltimorean. Students should realize that<br />\nliving in a non-University owned dwelling adds, not detracts,<br />\nfrom an education at Hopkins. Community relations would<br />\nbe remarkably improved if residents didn't have-to fear the<br />\nnext expansion of the University. What right did. Hopkins<br />\nhave to evict Ann Baker?<br />\nIf.additional student housing is aboslutely mandatory to<br />\n.<br />\nthe future of this University, then perhaps another dormitory<br />\nshould be built. But Hopkins must not steal fromi the<br />\ncommunity. Tragic incidents such as the case of Ann Baker<br />\nwill remind us all ot<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nPicnic<br />\nAnd what a fun day in the sun<br />\nit was! The Centennial Picnic<br />\neven brought out something we<br />\nsuspected all along: the Writing<br />\nSeminars Department has one<br />\nheck of a baseball team. Eating,<br />\ndrinking, rocking, and exercising.<br />\n.. too much.<br />\nWe think that this kind of<br />\nbringing together of the entire<br />\nHopkins co mmunityistudents,<br />\nemployees, and<br />\nfaculty,<br />\nfriends\u2014is too good to happen<br />\nonly once every hundred years.<br />\nBut since we won't have to call it<br />\n\"Centennial\" next time around,<br />\nwe can institute a few minor<br />\nadjustments. For instance, why<br />\nnot have two or more food<br />\noutlets? We'll miss the two hour<br />\nstints waiting in line with our<br />\nfavorite people, but that's the<br />\nbreaks. And why not hire<br />\nHopkins' bands? We're such a<br />\nbunch of snobs that teeny<br />\n\u2022 bopper rock won't cut it for us.<br />\nAs an off the cuff suggestion,<br />\nwhat about those guys who we<br />\njust haven't seen enough of this<br />\nyear?

RICHARD MACKSEY<br />\nAdmirers of Martin Scorsese's<br />\nTaxi Driver and Alice will have<br />\nan opportunity tonight to see<br />\nwhere the award-winning young<br />\ndirector comes from. The Film<br />\nWorkshop will preitnt two<br />\nperformances of his Mean Streets<br />\nin Shriver at 7:30 and 9:30 this<br />\nevening. The 'most personal of<br />\nScorsese's works to date, Mean<br />\nStreets was judged the best film<br />\nof the eleventh New York Film<br />\nFestival and provoked Pauline<br />\nKael to call it \"a true original of<br />\nour period. . . a blood thriller in<br />\nthe truest sense.\"<br />\nHarvey Keitel plays the<br />\nanti-hero loosely based on<br />\nScorsese's own memories of<br />\ngrowing up in Little Italy, a<br />\nportrait of the film-maker as<br />\nyoung mafioso. Robert De Niro<br />\nwon the New York Film Critics'<br />\nAward for his bravura<br />\nperformance as the flamboyant<br />\nfoil to Keitel's cautious hood.<br />\nScorsese's camera explores with<br />\nextraordinary fluidity the gritty,<br />\nlurid world of their cut-rate<br />\ninferno, bounded by the Bowery,<br />\nChinatown, and the<br />\nVillage<br />\nFrom the opening tracking shot<br /><br />\nof the neighborhood bar to the<br />\nharrowing last minutes of gun<br />\nplay, the director keeps the film<br />\nclose to the taste and feel of the<br />\nmean streets that the taxi driver<br />\ncruises through. The operatic<br />\nforce of the pop soundtrack and<br />\nthe vitality of De Niro's<br />\nperformance help to focus the<br />\nimprovisatory technique of the<br />\nacting.<br />\nFunny<br />\nDespite the grit and the gore,<br />\n. Mean Streets is a very funny<br />\nfilm, with familiar types caught<br />\nfrom absurd angles. Without<br />\nimpeding the action, Scorsese<br />\nmanages to explore a theme<br />\nnever completely achieved in The<br />\nGodfather\u2014the complex<br />\npsychological play between<br />\nbaroque religiosity and \"family\"<br />\ncrime. Joseph Gelmis touches on<br />\nsome of the Dantesque lights in<br />\nthe film: \"Marty Scorsese is a<br />\nmajor talent. His cameras can<br />\nmake a stroll through a garish bar<br />\nlook like a tour of hell, with the<br />\ndamned fouls brawling, boozing,<br />\neven killing each other.

The<br />\nvisiting Greyhounds tallieJ twice<br />\nin the top of the first inning, a<br />\ntwo-run double causing most of<br />\nthe damage.<br />\nThe Jays struck back in the<br />\nbottom of the third.<br />\nDesignated-hitter Rick Scott<br />\nwalked to lead off, and, one out<br />\nlater, moved to second as Lou<br />\nPodrazik collected the first of his<br />\nfour singles.<br />\nDave Lewing followed with a<br />\none-base hit, scoring Scott and<br />\nseonding Podrazik to third.<br />\nLewing promptly stole second<br />\nand both runners eventually<br />\ncrossed the plate on Tom<br />\nPedroni's two-out, two-run single<br />\nas the Jays took a 3-2 lead.<br />\nHopkins increased its<br />\nadvantage to 5-2 with lone runs<br />\nin both the fourth and fifth<br />\ninnings.

A double, a two-base error,<br />\nand a single pulled Loyola to<br />\nwithin one run at 5-4, but that<br /><br />\nwas as close as the score would<br />\nbecome.<br />\nThe Blue Jays added an<br />\ninsurance run in the bottom of<br />\nthe seventh as Podrazik singled,<br />\nmoved to third on a base-hit by<br />\nLewing and scored on Babb's<br />\nsacrifice fly.<br />\nSteffan Burns enabled the 6-4<br />\nlead to stand up with a fine<br />\neffort on the mound.

The<br />\nprotagonists in this contest were<br />\nBilly Jones of Hopkins and<br />\nDennis Compton of Washington.<br />\nThrough the first four innings<br />\nof the game, neither pitcher<br />\nallowed a base-hit. The visiting<br />\nShomen finally broke the spell<br />\nwith a pair of singles in the top<br />\nof the fifth, but Jones was able<br />\nto easily subdue this Washington<br />\nscoring effort.<br />\nThe Jays got their first safeties<br />\nof the afternoon in the bottom<br />\nof the sixth, but also proved<br />\nunable to score and the game<br />\nmoved into the seventh inning.<br />\nAs each contest in a<br />\ndoubleheader is only a regulation<br />\nseven innings, extra frames<br />\nbecame a distinct possibility.<br />\nHowever, Hopkins eliminated<br />\nthat chance in the bottom of the<br />\nseventh.

GILLY<br />\nWell, here we are in the last<br />\nweeks of the 1975-76 intramural<br />\nseason. All that remains are the<br />\nfew lacrosse and softball games<br />\nthat need to be made up after<br />\nbeing postponed, according to<br />\nthe new schedules that came out<br />\nlast week.<br />\nAs far as lacrosse goes, ATO<br />\nhas come out strong to lead the<br />\nfrat league with a perfect 5-0<br />\nrecord. First place in the three<br />\nindependent leagues are held by<br />\nLinguini Garbage Removal, 5-0,<br />\nHermition Operators and Genies,<br />\n3-1 (tie), and Meddies, 4-0.<br />\nPlayoffs among the top team in<br />\neach of the four leagues will<br />\nbegin this Thursday, April 29,<br />\nwith the finals on Tuesday, May<br />\n4.<br />\nThe swimming tournament last<br />\nmonth featured a grueling<br />\nfraternity competition, which<br />\nwas not decided until the final<br />\nre ay. Sig Ep emerged victorious<br /><br />\nwith DU and TEP just one and<br />\ntwo points behind respectively.<br />\nThe presentation of the<br />\nIn tramural Trophy for<br />\nfraternities, the Alumni Trophy<br />\nfor dormitories, and the G.<br />\nWilson Shaffer Award for the<br />\ngraduating senior who has<br />\ncontributed both academically<br />\nand athletically at Hopkins, will<br />\nimmediately precede the Army<br />\nlacrosse game this Saturday, May<br />\nI. These awards culminate the<br />\nyear's activities by recognizing<br />\noverall success and achievement<br />\nin athletics. As things stand now,<br />\nit looks like DU will upset the<br />\nincumbent, TEP, by 100 trophy<br />\npoints, while Wilson-Wood will<br />\nrepeat, having a comfortable 150<br />\npoint cushion over Hollander.<br />\nThe BIA has also been electing<br />\nnew officers and members. Next<br />\nyear's president is Shaun<br />\nHedman; recording secretary<br />\nTom Locraft; and corresponding<br />\nsecretary Philip Gilly.<br /><br />\nBrown scored three<br />\nconsecutive, unanswered goals<br />\nwithin tlie first three minutes of<br />\nthe third quarter to cut the Jays<br />\nlead to 9-7. The formula looked<br />\nfamiliar as Tom Rothman, Mike<br />\nEvans and John Meister all tallied<br />\nunassisted following Bill Ohlsen's<br />\ndomination of the first three<br />\nface-offs of the second half for<br />\nthe Ivy Leaguers.<br />\nFortunately a Hopkins<br />\ntime-out seemed to rectify the<br />\nsituation as the Blue Jays<br />\nblanked the Bruins foi the rest of<br />\nthe quarter while scoring three<br />\ngoals themselves, restoring their<br />\nlead to a comfortable 12-7. Mike<br />\nO'Neill, the Massapequa native<br />\nreturning home, had a hand in all<br />\nthree, scoring the first solo and<br />\nthen assisting on tallies by<br />\nWittelsberger (his fourth) and<br />\nKohler.<br />\nFrom then on it was all<br />\nHopkins as the closest the Rhode<br />\nIslanders could get was four goals<br />\nat 14-10. From there Hopkins<br />\nscored six straight in the last six<br />\nminutes to account for the final<br />\n20-10 total.<br />\nIn assessing the Jays highest<br />\nscoring output_ of the season, the<br />\nobvious place to bestow praise is<br />\nupon the offense and deservedly<br />\nso. The attack. led by Richie<br />\nHirsch's three goals and four<br />\nassits, combined for ten goals and<br />\nfive assists. Wittelsberger had<br />\nfour and one while O'Neill had<br />\ntwo scores and Zimmermannotched one and three, as the<br />\nmidfield was well represented ill<br />\nthe scorebook as well. Steve Wey,<br />\nJoe Devlin, and Bob Maimone<br />\neach had one goal while Huntley<br />\nand Greg Cunningham each had<br />\nan assist to round out the<br />\nscoring.<br />\nBut if one player's<br />\nperformance had to be<br />\nhighlighted then it was the<br />\nsh owing of goaltender Kevin<br />\nMahon. Brown outshot Hopkins<br />\n57-56 but Mahon's incredible<br />\ntotal of 24 saves as well as his<br />\nbrilliant play out of the nets<br />\nlimited the Bruins to only ten<br />\ngoals.<br /><br />\nACCOUNTING AND<br />\nFINANCE MAJORS<br />\nAED Speaker Series<br />\npresents<br />\nDr. Peter Tuteur from<br />\nWashington University<br />\nSchool of Medicine<br /><br />\nLET US HELP YOU TO<br />\nBECOME A CPA<br /><br />\nCPA<br />\nREVIEW<br /><br />\nwill speak on<br />\nMedical School Admissions<br />\nWednesday, April 28 @ 7:30 p.m.<br />\nin the L.V. room<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\nWASHINGTON<br />\nD.C.<br /><br />\n301 837-8442<br />\n202331.1410<br /><br />\nCOURSES BEGIN MAY 26 8.
