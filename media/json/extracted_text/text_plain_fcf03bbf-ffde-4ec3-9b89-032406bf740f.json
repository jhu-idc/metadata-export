This later<br />\nbecame known as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.<br />\nNapoleon, after his defeat by Credit Mobilier, was exiled to<br />\nElba, where he made the famous statement, \"Able was I ere I<br />\nsaw Elba.\" This sentence reads the same whether you spell it<br />\nforward or backward. You can also spell Marlboro backward \u2014<br />\nOroblratn.
