Ca 1 vert St., Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., APRIL 27, 1926.<br />\n<br />\nA NEW PRECEDENT<br />\nHas a new precedent been set as a result- of the Barnstormers' election of officers for next year? After the question<br />\nof whether a man should hold office on the campus when he<br />\nis not a regularly enrolled student in one of the undergraduate<br />\ndepartments has been discussed pro and con for several months,<br />\nthe Barnstormers, at least, seem'to have arri-ved 'at- a definite<br />\nconclusion, as their choice for Business Manager indicates.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe reasons for their decision seem logical and fair. They<br />\nhave picked a man who has done good work, who seems perfectly<br />\ncapable of filling the position.to ,which he has been elected, and<br />\nwho is practically certain of returning to the University next<br />\nyear. If the matter concerned the Club alone, we,.would have<br />\nno criticism to offer.'<br />\nBut the -Barnstormers are an integral part of the whole<br />\nsystem of- undergraduate activities which are under the control<br />\nof the Student Activities Council, and all their actions should<br />\nbe viewed in the light of -this fact. No matter what the conditions may be,- the election to office of a man not in college is<br />\nin direct opposition to the system upon which Hopkins activities<br />\nare based. Each organization receives a share of the compulsory<br />\nactivities fee, and it is only fair that \u2022offices in the activities<br />\nshould be open only to the reg-glarly accredited students who<br />\nhelp support them. Added to this .is the more important fact<br />\nthat since -the activities are operated under the control of the<br />\nUniversity; as purely secondary to regular collegiate work, they<br />\nare open only to members of -the University, with the added provision that they stand well in their studies.<br />\nThe present situation seems, then, a bit,incongruous, especially in view of the fact that there were men eligible for the office<br />\nwho are taking a requisite number of ourses and who have succeeded in keeping off the black list. The NEWS-LETTER would<br />\nsuggest-that the matter be taken up by either the Dean or the<br />\nStudent Council, so that by altering the rules to fit the case,<br />\nor by adjusting the case to fit the rules, the matter may be<br />\nsettled once for all.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS LEADS AGAIN<br />\nThe latest exemplification of the \"spirit of Hopkins idealism\"'so strongly lauded by Dr. Michael Pupinx at the last Commemoration Day exercises is the step taken by the Johns Hopkins chapter of Phi Beta Kappa'to prevent the curtailment of<br />\nthe advance of scientific investigation in American universities.<br />\nThe local chapter has taken cognizance of a tendency which,<br />\nif permitted to grow unchecked, may perceptibly impede the<br />\nprogress of mature, scholarly thought. A number of Southern<br />\nuniversities, notably state-endowed institutions, haVe forbidden<br />\nthe study of the theory of evolution, and related subjects. According to the plan of the Johns Hopkins chapter of Phi Beta<br />\nKappa, the charters of such institutions would be revoked, and<br />\nfurthermore, no charters would be granted universities that<br />\nadopted a similar policy.<br />\nIt is not strange even in this enlightened day that institutions of learning should frown upon doctrines which might be<br />\nat variance with the dogmatic beliefs of some of their faculty members. But to say arbitrarily that a theory which is<br />\nthe greatest influence in scientific and .philosophical circles<br />\ntoday may not be mentioned within their sacred portals is<br />\nequivalent to converting their colleges into theological seminaries.<br />\nOur Phi Beta Kappa chapter is to be congratulated.

Recognizing the reasonableness of his position, they<br />\ncan only, though with great reluctance, accede to his wishes<br />\nand take action accordingly.<br />\nResolved Further, That the<br />\nBoard record its keen appreciation of the devoted service<br />\nwhich Mr. Keyser has rendered<br />\nto the University as President<br />\nof its Board of Trustees during<br />\nall of these years. This service has been invaluable, given<br />\nat great sacrifice of time, with<br />\nunflagging zeal and without<br />\nother reward than the satisfaction of doing well a task of<br />\ngreat importance in support of<br />\nthe ideals for which the University was founded.<br />\nHis Presidency has covered<br />\nabout half of the life of the<br />\nUniversity. When he was first<br />\nelected the financial situation<br />\nof the University was not encouraging.<br />\nIts assets were<br />\nless than $6,000,000.00. The gift<br />\nof Homewood had been made,<br />\nbut a large part of the work of<br />\nthe University was still carried<br />\non at Howard Street in unsuitable surroundings, and funds<br />\nfor the development of the new<br />\nsite and new buildings thereon<br />\nwere not available. One of the<br />\ngreatest contributions Mr. Keyser made was the interest he<br />\naroused in the program for the<br />\ndevelopment of the grounds and<br />\nbuildings at Homewood and the<br />\nmoving of the University to Its<br />\nnew site. To this he gave constant attention and the admirable results obtained, and the<br />\nnoble and suitable buildings<br />\nerected are due in large measure to his endeavor.<br />\nWhile the move to Homewood<br />\nmay be regarded as the outstanding event during his administration, there have been<br />\nother notable accomplishments.<br />\nThe University has been expanded by the establishment of<br />\nthe School of Engineering, the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth, the Phipps Psychiatric<br />\nClinic, and the Wilmer Ophthalmological Clinic.<br />\nThese<br />\nhave been made possible by<br />\ngifts aggregating more than<br />\n$20,000,000.00, and the University assets have increased to<br />\nover $30,000,000.00.<br />\nDuring his term of office the<br />\nnumber of students has increased from 700 to more than 4500.<br />\nWhile the functions of a Trustee are largely concerned with<br />\nthe material' side of the University, Mr. Keyser's interest<br />\nin its educational progress and<br />\npolicy has been most active.<br />\nDuring his Presidency the advances in Medical Education,<br />\nthe introduction of the \"full<br />\ntime\" system of teaching, and<br />\nthe contemplate,d reorganization of the Philosophical Faculty have all required his attention, and he has had always<br />\nat heart the fullest possible development of every Department<br />\nof the University.<br />\nResolved Further, That this<br />\nBoard express its gratification<br />\nthat though retiring from the<br />\nPresidency,-Mr. Keyser has consented to remain a member of<br />\nthe Board, in which during his<br />\n(Continued on p. 3, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nYOUR MONEY GETS INTO THE BANK WHETHER<br />\nYOU PUT IT THERE OR NOT.

Ca 1 vert St., Baltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., APRIL 27, 1926.<br /><br />\nA NEW PRECEDENT<br />\nHas a new precedent been set as a result- of the Barnstormers' election of officers for next year? After the question<br />\nof whether a man should hold office on the campus when he<br />\nis not a regularly enrolled student in one of the undergraduate<br />\ndepartments has been discussed pro and con for several months,<br />\nthe Barnstormers, at least, seem'to have arri-ved 'at- a definite<br />\nconclusion, as their choice for Business Manager indicates.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe reasons for their decision seem logical and fair. They<br />\nhave picked a man who has done good work, who seems perfectly<br />\ncapable of filling the position.to ,which he has been elected, and<br />\nwho is practically certain of returning to the University next<br />\nyear. If the matter concerned the Club alone, we,.would have<br />\nno criticism to offer.'<br />\nBut the -Barnstormers are an integral part of the whole<br />\nsystem of- undergraduate activities which are under the control<br />\nof the Student Activities Council, and all their actions should<br />\nbe viewed in the light of -this fact. No matter what the conditions may be,- the election to office of a man not in college is<br />\nin direct opposition to the system upon which Hopkins activities<br />\nare based. Each organization receives a share of the compulsory<br />\nactivities fee, and it is only fair that \u2022offices in the activities<br />\nshould be open only to the reg-glarly accredited students who<br />\nhelp support them. Added to this .is the more important fact<br />\nthat since -the activities are operated under the control of the<br />\nUniversity; as purely secondary to regular collegiate work, they<br />\nare open only to members of -the University, with the added provision that they stand well in their studies.<br />\nThe present situation seems, then, a bit,incongruous, especially in view of the fact that there were men eligible for the office<br />\nwho are taking a requisite number of ourses and who have succeeded in keeping off the black list. The NEWS-LETTER would<br />\nsuggest-that the matter be taken up by either the Dean or the<br />\nStudent Council, so that by altering the rules to fit the case,<br />\nor by adjusting the case to fit the rules, the matter may be<br />\nsettled once for all.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS LEADS AGAIN<br />\nThe latest exemplification of the \"spirit of Hopkins idealism\"'so strongly lauded by Dr. Michael Pupinx at the last Commemoration Day exercises is the step taken by the Johns Hopkins chapter of Phi Beta Kappa'to prevent the curtailment of<br />\nthe advance of scientific investigation in American universities.<br />\nThe local chapter has taken cognizance of a tendency which,<br />\nif permitted to grow unchecked, may perceptibly impede the<br />\nprogress of mature, scholarly thought. A number of Southern<br />\nuniversities, notably state-endowed institutions, haVe forbidden<br />\nthe study of the theory of evolution, and related subjects. According to the plan of the Johns Hopkins chapter of Phi Beta<br />\nKappa, the charters of such institutions would be revoked, and<br />\nfurthermore, no charters would be granted universities that<br />\nadopted a similar policy.<br />\nIt is not strange even in this enlightened day that institutions of learning should frown upon doctrines which might be<br />\nat variance with the dogmatic beliefs of some of their faculty members. But to say arbitrarily that a theory which is<br />\nthe greatest influence in scientific and .philosophical circles<br />\ntoday may not be mentioned within their sacred portals is<br />\nequivalent to converting their colleges into theological seminaries.<br />\nOur Phi Beta Kappa chapter is to be congratulated.

Recognizing the reasonableness of his position, they<br />\ncan only, though with great reluctance, accede to his wishes<br />\nand take action accordingly.<br />\nResolved Further, That the<br />\nBoard record its keen appreciation of the devoted service<br />\nwhich Mr. Keyser has rendered<br />\nto the University as President<br />\nof its Board of Trustees during<br />\nall of these years. This service has been invaluable, given<br />\nat great sacrifice of time, with<br />\nunflagging zeal and without<br />\nother reward than the satisfaction of doing well a task of<br />\ngreat importance in support of<br />\nthe ideals for which the University was founded.<br />\nHis Presidency has covered<br />\nabout half of the life of the<br />\nUniversity. When he was first<br />\nelected the financial situation<br />\nof the University was not encouraging.<br />\nIts assets were<br />\nless than $6,000,000.00. The gift<br />\nof Homewood had been made,<br />\nbut a large part of the work of<br />\nthe University was still carried<br />\non at Howard Street in unsuitable surroundings, and funds<br />\nfor the development of the new<br />\nsite and new buildings thereon<br />\nwere not available. One of the<br />\ngreatest contributions Mr. Keyser made was the interest he<br />\naroused in the program for the<br />\ndevelopment of the grounds and<br />\nbuildings at Homewood and the<br />\nmoving of the University to Its<br />\nnew site. To this he gave constant attention and the admirable results obtained, and the<br />\nnoble and suitable buildings<br />\nerected are due in large measure to his endeavor.<br />\nWhile the move to Homewood<br />\nmay be regarded as the outstanding event during his administration, there have been<br />\nother notable accomplishments.<br />\nThe University has been expanded by the establishment of<br />\nthe School of Engineering, the<br />\nSchool of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth, the Phipps Psychiatric<br />\nClinic, and the Wilmer Ophthalmological Clinic.<br />\nThese<br />\nhave been made possible by<br />\ngifts aggregating more than<br />\n$20,000,000.00, and the University assets have increased to<br />\nover $30,000,000.00.<br />\nDuring his term of office the<br />\nnumber of students has increased from 700 to more than 4500.<br />\nWhile the functions of a Trustee are largely concerned with<br />\nthe material' side of the University, Mr. Keyser's interest<br />\nin its educational progress and<br />\npolicy has been most active.<br />\nDuring his Presidency the advances in Medical Education,<br />\nthe introduction of the \"full<br />\ntime\" system of teaching, and<br />\nthe contemplate,d reorganization of the Philosophical Faculty have all required his attention, and he has had always<br />\nat heart the fullest possible development of every Department<br />\nof the University.<br />\nResolved Further, That this<br />\nBoard express its gratification<br />\nthat though retiring from the<br />\nPresidency,-Mr. Keyser has consented to remain a member of<br />\nthe Board, in which during his<br />\n(Continued on p. 3, col. 2)<br /><br />\nYOUR MONEY GETS INTO THE BANK WHETHER<br />\nYOU PUT IT THERE OR NOT.
