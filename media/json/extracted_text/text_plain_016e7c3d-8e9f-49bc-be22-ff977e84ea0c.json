Gordon's<br />\ninitial proposal was to have two<br />\nstudents, two faculty members,<br />\nand one administrator.<br />\nIn a spirit of compromise, the<br />\nSAC proposed to have four students, two faculty members, and<br />\none administrator, thus allowing,<br />\nan administrator (as Gordon desired), while leaving the students<br />\nin the majority.

Both resolutions were<br />\nformally moved by Bob Heile, and passed by the Board.<br />\nOn the issue of housing for undergraduate female transfer students, the Executive Board expressed great dissatisfaction with President Gordon's course of<br />\naction.<br />\nDean Swanson's Ad Hoc Committee on<br />\nCoeducation met with the Housing Committee and decided that housing the transfers in the undergraduate dormitories<br />\nwould be the best policy. The Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee was informed by the administration that Dr. Gordon found this proposal unacceptable. Gordon felt that the<br />\ncost of converting the dorms for women<br />\nwas prohibitive. He decided on taking<br />\nover part of McCoy Hall for the transfer<br />\nwomen.<br />\nAfter hearing from Gordon,the Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee informed the Housing Committee that their help was not needed.<br />\nThis was done before the Housing Committee could consult with the Committee<br />\non Student Affairs, which it must consult<br />\nbefore making decisions. The SA had also'<br />\ndecided that the dorms were the best<br />\nplace in which to house the transfers.<br />\nCotter expressed anger' over the fact<br />\nthat Gordon was decided upon using McCoy before ever going through the<br />\nmotions on consulting the various committees. He maintained that Gordon was<br />\nplanning the details of using McCoy before any committee had expressed an<br />\nopinion on the issue.<br />\nIn defense of the use of the dorms,<br />\nCotter revealed the results of an unofficial poll among residents of the upper-<br />\n<br />\nclass houses. The majority of those interviewed said that they would be willing<br />\nto move out, in order to let women have<br />\nthe rooms. The Board members agree<br />\nthat no conversion of the dorms would<br />\nbe necessary, especially since the construction of a women's dorm (planned<br />\nfor the near future) would necessitate<br />\nreconversion.<br />\nIn light of these facts,Cotter introduced a resolution that two undergraduate<br />\ndorms be temporarily converted for use<br />\nby women, until a new women's dorm is<br />\nbuilt.

As evidence they singled out administrative disregard for recommendations of the Committee on Student Affairs<br />\nand the Housing Committee in formulating policies on student conduct and on the<br />\nhousing of undergraduate women.<br />\nTwo resolutions were proposed. The<br />\n<br />\nfirst was that a committee be established to draw up the details of a University<br />\nSenate.

While<br />\nciting \"unique opportunities in the past,\"<br />\nhe felt that Hopkins would gain \"no real<br />\ntangible benefits\" from NSA membership<br />\nat the present time.

Most people thought the<br />\norganization was finished when LBJ<br />\nfinally ordered the CIA to cut it out,<br />\nsettle accounts, and to let the students<br />\npay their own bills. The president of NSA<br />\nat that time, Gene Groves, conceded that<br />\nthe revelation would \"make the work of<br />\nNSA difficult, if not impossible.\"<br />\nNSA has had a hard time. First student governments at big campuses like<br />\nMichigan, Chicago, and Wisconsin<br />\ncleansed themselves of membership post<br />\nhaste. Then with the rise of more militant confrontation-style student politics,<br />\nthe liberal government agencies and the<br />\nfoundations decided to step out.<br />\nBy April 1 la.<br />\nst year things had gotten<br />\nso bad at the NSA townhouse between<br />\n<br />\nGeorgetown and the Washington ghetto<br />\nthat bankruptcy seemed imminent. \"On<br />\nApril 1, NSA's bank account was $7500<br />\noverdrawn, we had not paid payroll tax<br />\nfor the first quarter of the year (which<br />\nwas $20,000), our phone bill of $10,000<br />\nwas 60 days overdue, and our total<br />\ndebt equaled $318,000,\" one of last<br />\nyear's administrative staff members<br />\nrecalls.<br />\nThe End of NSA, as simple as it may<br />\nseem, has always been a question fraught<br />\nwith a complex of unexpected consequences. Critics have long claimed that the<br />\nmain thing that keeps NSA going is the<br />\nplatform it offers student politicos for<br />\nentering graduate schools, the government, and academic associations like<br />\nthe American Council on Education.<br />\nNot the least of the<br />\ncharges comes<br />\nfrom Jim Sutton, just resigned Executive Vice President.

One would think the days past,<br />\nwhen freshmen would seriously entertain the notion that<br />\nthey could not \"make it\" socially without the aid of a<br />\nfraternity.<br />\nThere is no single reason why the fraternity system is on<br />\nthe decline. Perhaps there is less desire to kill off one's<br />\nconsciousness in orgiastic revelry; perhaps the phenomenon<br />\ncalled \"privatism\" is causing fraternities to fold; certainly<br />\nthe replacement of beer with drugs has a lot to do with the<br />\ndecline of the system. Regardless of the reasons, it is becoming more and more apparent that fraternity affiliation<br />\nis no more a social necessity at Hopkins than a raccoon<br />\ncoat.<br />\nIn light of this, it was particularly galling to hear the<br />\nline that a brother in a Charles Street House was feeding to<br />\na freshman. Last Friday, the brother assured his guest that<br />\n\"Some guys can make it as independents, but if you want<br />\nwomen,joining a good house is really the only way!\"<br />\nThere is no doubt that for some students, fraternity life<br />\noffers certain advantages. And it is unfortunate that three<br />\nof the better houses folded last year. For students who<br />\nwant to join a fraternity, there is now even less diversity<br />\nand less choice. But any statement regarding fraternities as<br />\na social necessity is simply untrue. A fraternity is a luxury<br />\nand an expensive one at that.<br />\nThis is readily apparent to most freshmen who have come<br />\nout of their rooms during the first semester. Perhaps the<br />\nbrothers would do better to drop their \"hype\" tactics and<br />\nattempt to tell the truth. Only in that way will they be able<br />\nto save their societies from complete ruin. The alternative<br />\nis pledging only those freshmen who swallow all the bullshit of rush, a prospect at which even the most die-hard<br />\nrushers wince.<br />\nTHE WIZARD OF ID<br />\nr<br />\nHAVE<br />\nTERRIBLE<br />\nHANGovg!<br />\n<br />\nC Field Enterprises, Inc., 1970<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 10, 1970<br />\n<br />\nOlander<br />\n<br />\nil<br />\n<br />\nBy CHRISTOPHER OLANDER<br />\nIf the environment is caught in an ever higher<br />\nspiral of destruction and abuse, then what can the<br />\nspecies that made it so do about it? There are<br />\ncertainly rumblings in the voting public (say government officials) that have been deluged in recent<br />\nmonths with letters and telegrams. The students<br />\ntoo, the media reports, are onthe warpath against<br />\nthe scandalous misuse of natural resources and<br />\npollution of the environment. At one university,<br />\nstudents in a new environmental action group buried an automobile engine just as others once buried<br />\nsmall coffins to protest another immorality. The<br />\ngreatest fear, though, is that the environment as<br />\nVietnam before it will be a forgotten cause, one to<br />\nwhich the low attention span of the American people will only briefly pay homage.<br />\nThere has been a beginning which, to be fair,<br />\nmust be acknowledged. In the state of Maine, the<br />\nlegislature last week passed unamimously a measure by which an Environmental Commission is<br />\nestablished. This has been done before with little<br />\nsuccess. The difference in the Maine commission<br />\nis that it has authority to protect the coast of that<br />\nstate. ThE commission has virtual control over<br />\nsites for industrial development.In order to clean<br />\nup damage already done by oil seepage, the commission is empowered to levy a tax on all oil that<br />\npasses through the state.<br />\n<br />\nDeleterious Effect<br />\nAt the other end of the Eastern seabord,another<br />\nfight waged by the conservationists has beenwon.<br />\nThe Florida Everglades,long threatened by a noisy<br />\nand fumeous jet-port, were saved by direct intervention from Washington. The President(whether<br />\nbecause of committment or pressure is unclear)<br />\nstopped all federal funds destined for the project.<br />\nThe incredibly deleterious effect such a project<br />\n<br />\nwould have had on the wildlife in that natural sanctuary raised an outcry from naturalists that residents-soon picked up.<br />\nOne cannot imagine, however, that every time a<br />\nthreat to the environment occurs some noble<br />\nscientist is going to raise a balled fist and lead a<br />\ncharge up the steps of some government building.<br />\nFirst of all, there are too many threats to the environment and too few conservationists; secondly,<br />\nthe public cannot realistically be expected to fight<br />\nsuch battles with the regularity that would be required. Since there is no magical formula, what can<br />\nbe done?<br />\nThe word \"law\" connotes flexibility, due proc.iss and the ability of polluters to tie cases up<br />\nin the courts for a millenia. The word which everyone in this free society, especially government and<br />\nbusiness leaders, is trying to avoid and which<br />\nsmacks of totalitarian regimentation is \"control.\"<br />\n<br />\nHopelessly Fragmented<br />\nTotal, inflexible control is what is necessary to<br />\nstop pollution and prevent its recurrence. Unfortunately, the governmental agencies which presently deal with pollution are so structured as to<br />\nprevent any solution at all. The Secretary of Health,<br />\nEducation and Welfare, Robert Finch, has called<br />\nthe efforts at control to date\"hopelessly fragmented.\" For instance, Mr. Finch's agency is in charge<br />\nof air pollution and solid waste disposal and is<br />\narmed with a vast number of shockingly impotent<br />\nlaws. The Interior Department, under the leadership of that paragon of conservation Wally Hickel,<br />\nis in charge of water pollution. The Atomic energy<br />\nCommission, probably the most self-serving<br />\norganizqtion<br />\nin the<br />\nentire<br />\nUnited States<br />\ngovernment, theoretically regulates the pollution which emanates from atomic reactors<br />\nin the form of thermal heat.<br />\n(continued on page 5)<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The<br />\nEditors<br />\nLOVE IT OR LEAVE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThese are times of great turmoil on our campuses. Contributing to this turmoil has been<br />\nthe too-often ignored concept of<br />\n\"president unrest\". It is instructive to examine this at Hopkins (since here the example is<br />\nmuch clearer and may well serve<br />\nas a model for other campuses).<br />\nWe may then attempt to discover<br />\nunderlying the<br />\nreasons<br />\nthe<br />\nalienation of our university presidents, in their frustrated attempts to become \"relevant\" to<br />\nthe world outside them.<br />\nA number of events seem to<br />\npoint out that such a person, despite the constant rhetoric of relating to the university community, is simply interested in<br />\nthe idea of \"presidential power\".<br />\nTo me this demand seems quite<br />\nunreasonable, since for the most<br />\n<br />\npart, they have no real stake in<br />\nthe university. For while the faculty and students may have a<br />\npermanent commitment to the<br />\nacademic community, what commitment can a man have, who is<br />\nbusy with his work in the OAS,or<br />\nwho might even be offered an ambassadorship in some far-off<br />\nland?<br />\n<br />\nsity. This makes it necessary to<br />\nestablish his own legitimacy,<br />\nwithout reference to the regular<br />\nchannels, ie. his committees,and<br />\nto issue demands that the university accept HIS proposal on student conduct; in the hopes of generating confrontation with the<br />\npowers which actually rule the<br />\nuniversity.<br />\n<br />\nSuch a person also seems to<br />\nhave a complete disregard for the<br />\nuse of \"proper channels\" and for<br />\nthe methods of the university,<br />\nwhich we all know to be that of<br />\nfree discussion and \"rational<br />\ndialogue\". He complains that the<br />\nregular channels, which we have<br />\nso carefully built up over the<br />\nyears, no longer work. The channels seem,in fact,to \"co-opt\" the<br />\npresident, preventing the attainment of effective presidential<br />\n\"input\", so necessary to the<br />\nachievement of his proper role in<br />\ndecision-making at the univer-<br />\n<br />\nIt is no wonder, then, that his<br />\nfrustrated efforts to achieve<br />\nchange, lead him to a realization<br />\nof his own oppression, and to a<br />\ndesire for \"liberation\", for the<br />\nright to determine his own destiny (and that of students and<br />\nBrazilians).<br />\nSome might say: \"If you don't<br />\nlove our University,Lincoln Gordon, then go back to Brazil\", but<br />\nwe know that he wouldn't want to I<br />\nlive there.<br />\n<br />\nRobert J.

Introduction<br />\nTo attempt to define rules of conduct in terms of<br />\nspecific forms of misconduct is to risk omissions<br />\nand to provoke a series of after-the-fact amendments<br />\nthat weaken the force of the original policy statement.<br />\nRather, it is preferable that such rules be stated in<br />\nterms of the general characteristics which identify<br />\nsuch classes of behavior, and that fair procedural<br />\narrangements provide for their application to specific<br />\ncases. The University's methods should be those of<br />\nrational inquiry and dialogue. Thus, the application<br />\nof behavioral sanctions to its students is an inherently<br />\ndistasteful process. However, traditional dependence<br />\non self-discipline by members of the academic community does not in fact always prevent actions prejudicial to the rights of others. Every university is<br />\ntherefore compelled to seek policies and procedures<br />\nthat ensure its integrity as a social institution. In<br />\ndoing so, however, it must be mindful of the interests and rights of its members, must uphold the right<br />\n<br />\n11. The Sanction of Suspension<br />\nThe sanction of suspension may be recommended<br />\nby the chief administrative officer of the Division or<br />\nhis designated representative but the sanction shall<br />\nbe applied only on the basis of a hearing for the student charged with misconduct by an ad hoc Review<br />\nBoard composed of students and members of the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nSuspension shall be the most severe sanction used<br />\nby the University and may be imposed for whatever<br />\nperiod is considered to be appropriate in a particular<br />\ncase. Where suspension is for a period longer than<br />\none year the student shall have the right to an annual<br />\nappeal to the Review Board for reinstatement.<br />\nThe hearing shall be conducted in conformity with<br />\nthe following principles.<br />\n<br />\nJanuary 5, 1970<br />\nPresident Lincoln Gordon<br />\nHomewood House<br />\nCampus<br />\nDear President Gordon:<br />\nI enclose for your consideration the recommendations<br />\nof the Committee on Student Affairs regarding the<br />\nProposed Statement on Student Conduct, together with<br />\na Summary of some of the more important reasons<br />\nfor its divergence from the documents which were<br />\nlaid before the Committee. The amendments were,<br />\nas you know, arrived at during a full semester of discussion by a Committee which, for the first time, had<br />\namong its members the elected chief representatives<br />\nof the Graduate and Undergraduate bodies. All the<br />\nrecommended changes were arrived at and agreed in<br />\nfull committee by majority or unanimous votes. The<br />\ncomposition of the committee is such that in fact all<br />\nthe majorities involved contained both student and<br />\nfaculty or administration members. The accompanying supplement, on the other hand, was, for convenience, drafted by the Chairman of the Committee in<br />\nconsultation with various individual members and<br />\nsubsequently passed by the full corn mittee,with minor<br />\nrecommendations, as representing a reasonable<br />\nattempt to elucidate some of the main points at issue.<br />\nIf anything remains unclear, both the Committee as a<br />\ngroup and I myself individually would be only too<br />\nhappy to try to resolve the difficulty.<br />\nFinally, I<br />\nshould like to thank you, together with Dr. Bevan and<br />\nDr. Kimball, for your courtesy in coming to meet the<br />\nCommittee and in discussing the various major problems with it.<br />\nYours sincerely,<br />\nJohn White<br />\nChairman, Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs<br />\n<br />\nResolved that the Committee on Student Affairs advises that the Proposed Policy Statement on Student<br />\nConduct should be amended to take the following<br />\nform, and be accompanied by the appended Supplement.<br />\n<br />\nto approproiate sanctions consists of conduct that<br />\nabridges the rights of other individuals or groups,<br />\nespecially as it affects the educational goals of those<br />\nwithin the University community, or threatens their<br />\nsafety, health, or property, or conduct that causes<br />\ndamage to physical facilities of the University.<br />\nADDENDUM 2 for effect on the Homewood<br />\nCampus:<br />\nConduct which might be construed as coming under the above heading, but which was<br />\npreviously within the jurisdiction of the Honor<br />\nCommission, shall remain within that jurisdiction. The maximum sanction to be imposed by<br />\nthat body shall be suspension and a suitable<br />\nappeals procedure shall be devised by that body.<br />\nThe University will not intrude itself into the personal lives of its students nor will it add sanctions<br />\nfor unlawful behavior already dealt with by civil<br />\nauthority, unless such behavior falls within the class<br />\nof conduct described above. It is understood that<br />\nsanctions are to be rationally applied and commensurate to the seriousness of the precipitating misconduct.

It is to be expected, however,<br />\nthat decisions of the Review Boards established pursuant to this policy statement would be carried out.<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE<br />\nSupplementary text to the Proposed Policy on<br />\nStudent Conduct<br />\nThe Committee concentrated its attention on the<br />\nProposed Policy Statement on Student Conduct as<br />\nre-drafted by the President, while referring also<br />\nto the previous draft by the Ad Hoc Committee.<br />\nIt will be notea that the Committee proposes<br />\nsome amendments to the President's draft, and the<br />\nfollowing is an attempt to indicate a few of the reasons behind the proposed changes.<br />\nThe page references are to the Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs draft.<br />\n2.<br />\nPage 1. Paragraph 1. Order of Introduction<br />\nIt emerged that there were very divergent views<br />\nabout the nature of a university. Both faculty<br />\nand student members felt that platonic general<br />\nstatements frequently did not meet with the reaction expected by those making them, and tended<br />\n1.<br />\n<br />\nto appear hypocritical to many in the face of certain fairly common aspects of the actualities of<br />\nuniversity life.<br />\nThese criticisms did not apply with the same<br />\nforce if the same or very similar statements<br />\nwere applied to particular circumstances.<br />\nIt was also felt that a document on student<br />\nconduct should get to the point as quickly as<br />\npossible.<br />\nIn the light of these considerations, the order of<br />\npage 1 of the President's statement was altered,<br />\nand all statements in the document were made to<br />\n-efer to the matter at hand; namely, Rules of<br />\nStudent Conduct.<br />\n3. Page 1. Paragraph 1. Line 11. Rights.<br />\nHere, as at some subsequent points in the document, the references to the interests and rights<br />\nof others (page 2, line 4) were shortened to 'the<br />\nrights of others'.<br />\nIt was pointed out that a university is, like any<br />\ncommunity, necessarily one in which there are<br />\nmany conflicting interests. Defining those interests and deciding on priorities between them<br />\nin many possible cases of reasonable conflict was<br />\nconsidered to be a hopeless task which would only<br />\nlead to disagreement and confusion. On the other<br />\nhand, while the definition of rights might be no<br />\nless difficult in some respects, it was felt that<br />\nthose rights, however defined, would in the context<br />\nof rules of conduct, be common to all and therefore<br />\nnot liable to lead to the same degree of controversy.<br />\n4. Page 1. Paragraph 1. Penultimate line. Free<br />\nSpeech<br />\nA positive reference to the right of free speech<br />\nwas added primarily because the document would<br />\nundoubtedly circulate outside the University community and come to the attention of individuals or<br />\ngroups whose understanding of the implications of<br />\nthe principle, or of its application in the context<br />\nunder discussion, might not be as clear as was that<br />\nof members of the university.<br />\n5. Page 1. Addendum 1. Homewood Campus<br />\nThe Committee was unanimous that, as a matter<br />\nof principle it was better to consult before rather<br />\nthan after the event.<br />\nIt was felt that unless there was consultation before rather than after the making of major policy<br />\ndecisions, the likelihood of unnecessary crises<br />\nwould be increased.<br />\nFinally, since all sections of the University<br />\nwould be involved in the appeals mechanism, it<br />\nwould be wise to involve all sections in the establishment of the policies with the implementation<br />\nand contravention of which any Review Board would<br />\nhave to deal.<br />\nSince the Committee on Student Affairs would<br />\nno longer have to act as the Review Board and<br />\nwould be wholly separate from it, it seemed that<br />\nit was the only appropriate forum involving faculty, students, and administration within the existing university machinery which could advise on<br />\nsuch matters pending the establishment of a Senate<br />\nor other similar body.<br />\n6. Page 2. Behavior Subject to Sanctions<br />\nIn Section 1 of the President's Draft, the word<br />\n'interests' was struck for the reasons given above<br />\n(Section 3). The word 'welfare' was deleted because it appeared to be redundent. There appear-<br />\n<br />\ned to be no significant category of misconduct covered by it which would not be already covered by<br />\nthe rights of others or threats to safety, health,<br />\nproperty or damage to the physical facilities of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nAs regards the proposed amendment, the Committee felt that the basis of conduct in a university is concern for the rights of others. The<br />\nphrase 'other individuals or groups' was seen<br />\nas covering both the university community and<br />\nlarger<br />\nthe<br />\ncommunity of which it is a part.<br />\n'Groups' was taken to cover formal and institutional groups as well as informal groups. Thus,<br />\na student who misrepresented his academic record at Johns Hopkins in order to obtain entry<br />\nto another University would be abridging the rights<br />\nof the Hopkins community and of its individual<br />\nmembers to their good name and to their reputation for trustworthiness, and to their right to a<br />\nfair representation of their competitive standing.<br />\nHe would also be abriding the right of the other<br />\nuniversity community to expect true information<br />\nfrom a member of the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe opening phrase of the passage on conduct<br />\nsubject to sanction was closed by a comma in<br />\norder to establish its general significance and<br />\napplication. The succeeding phrases then amplify its import in relation to the Hopkins community, spelling out certain major categories of rights<br />\nwhich must be safeguarded.<br />\nThe phrase 'conduct that disrupts the normal<br />\nfunctioning of the university' was deleted because<br />\nit was found to have no substantial and specific<br />\nmeaning, and thus was liable to be applied to any<br />\nsituation which some particular section of the<br />\nUniversity found offensive.

For<br />\nthe most part, the university would be dependent<br />\nupon the wisdom and common sense of the Review<br />\nBoards which established or confirmed precedents<br />\ncase by case. The Committee was therefore concerned to reduce to the minimum the inevitable<br />\nambiguity or area of uncertainty involved in such<br />\na statement. It was of the opinion that this could<br />\nbetter be done by the establishment of a single<br />\nPrinciple, with some subsequent description of specific areas of concern, than by accumulating a series<br />\nof statements each of which was ambiguous both in<br />\nitself and in the nature of its relationship to the<br />\nPreceding necessarily imprecise statements.<br />\n7.

Section 1 Homewood Campus<br />\nSince all the forms of misconduct at presentwithin<br />\nthe jurisdiction of the Honor Commission could be<br />\nconstrued as falling within the broad class of behavior subject to sanction which was described in<br />\nthe preceding paragraph, the effect would be to<br />\ncreate a clash of jurisdictions or else to abolish<br />\nthe Honor Commission unless this sentence was<br />\nadded.<br />\nIt was felt that the existence or otherwise of the<br />\nHonor Commission was a separate issue requiring considerable investigation and discussion, and<br />\nthe Committee did not wish to disturb a functioning<br />\nInstitution unless there was clear evidence that it<br />\nwas desirable to do so.<br />\n8.

Final Paragraph of Section 1. Last<br />\n9.<br />\nsentence. Extenuating Circumstances<br />\nIt was recognized that it was important to stress<br />\nthat extenuating circumstances should be carefully<br />\nconsidered in view of the guide-lines established<br />\nIn the opening paragraph of the Introduction. References to the appellants 'motivation' and to<br />\n'Impelling circumstance' seemed, however, to open<br />\nthe door to grave difficulties of interpretation even<br />\nif they did not actually encourage certain types of<br />\nundesirable action. A simple reference to extenuating circumstances was therefore preferred.<br />\n10. Page 2. Section II. Paragraph's 2 and 3. Suspension<br />\nIn the light of the references to 'rational dialogue', 'humane tradition', etc. incorporated in the<br />\nIntroduction, and taken over from both previous<br />\ndrafts of the Proposed Statement, the Committee<br />\n<br />\nfelt that the sanction of explusion should be abolished.<br />\nMaking suspension the most severe sanction applicable would place the emphais on the possibility of<br />\nsocial education and rehabilitation rather than on<br />\nthe purely punitive aspect of sanctions, and would<br />\nnot imply that certain types of behavior were irredeemable.<br />\nThe University's need to protect itself would be as<br />\nfully safeguarded by suspension as by explusion<br />\nprovided that no limit was set on the term for<br />\nwhich suspension could be applied.<br />\nIt was recognized that the right to annual appeal<br />\nmight occasionally result in appeals which were<br />\nessentially frivolous, but such appeals could be<br />\nrapidly dealt with once a year and need cause no<br />\nserious administrative problem.<br />\n11. Page 3. Section II. Number 1. Composition of<br />\nthe Board<br />\nAfter considering the President's proposal, along<br />\nwith many other possible combinations, the Committee came to the conclusion that the proposal<br />\nput forward by the Ad Hoc Committee composed<br />\nof three senior administrators, four members of<br />\nthe faculty, and three students, was the soundest<br />\nproposal in the light of all the factors to be considered.<br />\nThe Ad Hoc Committee's proposal was only<br />\nmodified by specifying<br />\n(a) that there should be two graduate and<br />\ntwo undergraudate students instead of<br />\nmerely an undifferentiated total of four<br />\nstudents.<br />\nthat the chairman should be chosen by<br />\nvote of the board from the whole membership and not be an appointed student.<br />\nThis change was made in order to allow<br />\nthe board freedom to choose the best<br />\nchairman that it could from among its<br />\nmembers, and also to limit the influence<br />\nof the administration which was already<br />\nrepresented on the board, which was responsible for bringing charges before the<br />\nboard, and which held the final power of<br />\nveto over its decisions.<br />\nThe Reason for rejecting the alternative proposal that the chairman should<br />\nbe chosen by lot was that the random<br />\nselection of the board was, in itself a<br />\nsufficient safe-guard. In view of the<br />\nall inclusive nature of the pools from<br />\nwhich members were to be drawn, the<br />\nneed to have the best possible chairman was felt to be an overriding consideration. Conversely, any reduction<br />\nof the size of the pools would lead to<br />\nthe danger that the board, or sections<br />\nof it, might become unrepresentative<br />\nsamples of the groups concerned and<br />\ntend to favor particular interests.<br />\n(c) that the administrative representative<br />\nshould not be an appointee of the administrative head of the division concerned and therefore of the administrator ultimately responsible for charges brought before the board. It was<br />\nheld to be undesirable to place the administrative representative in the ano-<br />\n<br />\n(b)<br />\n<br />\nmalous position of being directly responsible to the prosecution by viture of<br />\nappointment and of at the same time<br />\nbeing expected to act as an impartial<br />\njudge. The proposed alteration would<br />\nplace the administrator on an equal<br />\nfooting with all other members of the<br />\nboard.<br />\nThe Committee felt that there was no<br />\nforce in the argument put foward in the<br />\nPresident's covering letter, that a body<br />\nlarger than five would be difficult to<br />\nbring together. This would only be true<br />\nin the case of a committee or board of<br />\nlimited, fixed membership. Since the<br />\nproposed board was to be drawn from<br />\nlarge pools of eligible individuals, the<br />\ninability of any particular nominee to<br />\nattend would cause no difficulty, as another could be asked to serve in his<br />\nplace.<br />\nThe Committee saw the force of the<br />\nargument that, all things being equal,<br />\nno section of the community should hold<br />\na majority in matters affecting all sections. It was also conscious of the fact<br />\nthat all things were by no means equal<br />\nin the present context. Its attention was<br />\ndrawn to the fact that no such principle<br />\nwas operative elsewhere in the University. The decisions of the Academic<br />\nCouncil could be held to be of interest<br />\nto the University as whole, and not least<br />\nto students, yet the faculty held an overwhelming majority on it and no students<br />\nwere represented. The whole University<br />\ncertainly had an interest in the honesty<br />\nof students and the fairness and reliability of grading, but the Honor Commission was wholly composed of students.<br />\nIndeed, if there were a principle which<br />\nseemed to be fairly generally operative<br />\nin the structure of the University, it<br />\nwould seem to be that the section of the<br />\ncommunity most directly concerned tended to have a preponderance in numbers<br />\nover any other section, and most often<br />\nheld an absolute majority.<br />\nIn the present case, the Review Board<br />\nwas to be set up with a view to regulating student conduct alone, and was not<br />\nconcerned with the conduct of other<br />\nsections of the University. Although<br />\nany section of the University might initiate proceedings, the administration<br />\nwould in effect act as prosecutor before<br />\nthe board, would have a representative<br />\non the board, and would have the final<br />\nright of veto. To maintain a reasonable balance within such a three part<br />\nsystem, it seemed right that the peers<br />\nof those to be accused should have a<br />\nslight preponderance in the second or<br />\njudicial stage. The aim of the University in. setting up its disciplinary institutions should be to held its inroads<br />\n(continued on following page)<br />\n<br />\nto demand that President Gordon withdraw his proposal of January 26<br />\nLast week's meeting of the Graduate Student Organization.

Robert<br />\n<br />\n\fA NEWS-LETTER SUPPLEMENT<br />\n<br />\nTHE STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CONDUCT DRAFT<br />\n<br />\nFeb.10,1970<br />\n<br />\nDraft Provided Backbone of Gordon's Version<br />\n(continued from preceding page)<br />\non the principle of self-discipline enunciated in the Introduction to the unavoidable minimum. The suggested composition of the Review Board, therefore, was<br />\nheld to be desirable in principle, but was<br />\nalso most likely in practice to ensure<br />\nthe respect and trust of that section of<br />\nthe University community which would<br />\nalone be brought before it.<br />\nFor somewhat. similar reasons it was<br />\nfelt that an administrator should be<br />\nassociated with the judicial proceedings<br />\nby a process of random selection, in spite<br />\nof the involvement of administrators at<br />\nthe other two stages of the three-part<br />\nprocedure. It was felt that the prime<br />\nconsideration was that the administration should feel that its interests had been<br />\nrepresented and that it should not be<br />\nable to disassociate itself from any verdict which might be rendered by the Review Board.<br />\nFinally, the Committee also supported<br />\nthe conclusion of the Ad Hoc Committee<br />\nas to total membership of the Review<br />\nBoard, which was seven. It was felt that<br />\na slightly larger board than that suggested by the President would be likely to<br />\nbe more stable and a little less liable to<br />\nbe unduly affected by the peculiarities of<br />\nany individual who might be placed on it<br />\nby the process of random selection.<br />\n12. Page 3. SectionII.Number 4. Calling of Witnesses<br />\nThe word 'consenting' was deleted since, though a<br />\nwitness might be called, he need not, in the absence<br />\nof power of subpoena, appear, and it seemed desirable to do nothing, in the wordingof the document, to<br />\nweaken the expectation that witnesses would appear<br />\nwhen asked to do so.<br />\n13. Page 4. Section II. Number 5. Assistance at<br />\nHearings<br />\nIt seemed unnecessarily divisive of the University<br />\ncommunity to confine assistance at hearings to<br />\nstudents, when a member of the faculty or of the<br />\nadministration might be willing, and better qualified,<br />\nfor one reason or another, to assist a student who<br />\nmight be disadvantaged in some way or otherwise<br />\nfeel himself to be in need of help before the Board.<br />\n14. Page 4. Section II. Number 6. Procedure at<br />\nHearings<br />\nIt was felt desirable, in view of the importance<br />\nof such procedures to the University at large, to<br />\nestablish that hearings should, except at the specific<br />\nrequest of the accused be held in public and that<br />\nin the case of such public hearings all, and not<br />\nmerely some parts of the evidence, should be<br />\nheard in public.<br />\nIt also seemed important to allow the board to<br />\nstate its reasons for its decisions if it so wished,<br />\nand not merely to confine it to a statement of its<br />\ndecision, as was previously proposed.<br />\n15. Page 4. Section II. Number 7. Destruction of<br />\nDocuments<br />\nThe wording of this section was simplified slightly. No special regulation was needed for students<br />\nunder suspension since they would not, technically<br />\nspeaking have 'left' as long as they maintained their<br />\nstatus.<br />\n16. Page 4. Section II. Number 8.<br />\nWhereas the Ad hoc Committee, envisaging a true<br />\nappeals situation, in which the student concerned<br />\nhad the right, if he so desired, to appeal against<br />\nan otherwise valid sentence, established that the<br />\ncase should be heard within ten days, the President's document made no mention of any time<br />\nlimit.<br />\nThe feeling in the committee was that the judicial<br />\nprocess should not only be as open, but as expeditious as possible. It believed that in the case of<br />\nhearings of the type envisaged, which did not involve the full panoply of civil or criminal legal'<br />\nprocess, five working days would be sufficient for<br />\n<br />\nDr. Steven Mann of the Education Department, one of the<br />\n\"radicals\" of the Committee on Student Affairs. Mann was<br />\nalso a member of the ad hoc committee whiela drew up the<br />\noriginal guidelines for the President's office. photos by leitun<br />\n<br />\nAlex Sotir, coach and another of the committee's members.<br />\nThe S.A.C. consists of five faculty members and six students.<br />\nany necessary preparations. Particularly in cases<br />\nwhich might touch on the interests of large sections<br />\nof the university or result from group actions, it<br />\nseemed essential not to delay beyond the necessary<br />\nminimum in order, on the one hand, to avoid the<br />\ndanger of escalating involvement, and, on the other,<br />\nto avoid a tendency to declare an emergency when<br />\nno such emergency was actually in existence because<br />\nof a fear of escalation during a lengthy waiting<br />\nperiod.<br />\nThe term 'working days', rather than 'academic<br />\nworking days', was specifically intended to avoid<br />\ninordinate delays in the case of alleged misconduct within a day or so of the end of a semester<br />\nor academic year, or in other similar situations.<br />\n17. Page 4. Section II. Number 9.<br />\nThe Committee believed that the imposition of<br />\nimmediate interim suspension was undesirable.<br />\n<br />\nThe Committee was acutely aware of the administrative need for swift action in the case of certain types of misconduct. It believed, however,<br />\nthat in all cases involving acute physical danger<br />\nor serious and immediate clanger to property, the<br />\nonly proper line of action was recourse to the<br />\ncivil authorities. The student members of the<br />\nCommittee were particularly insistent that the<br />\nuniversity community should not be insulated from<br />\nthe law of the land, if a proper sense of responsibility was to be achieved.<br />\nIn cases which did not involve imminent danger,<br />\nit ,was felt to be undesirable that the individual<br />\nadministrator, who might be under considerable<br />\npressure of one kind or another, should be able<br />\nto assume power which he would not otherwise<br />\nhave, simply by a unilateral declaration that an<br />\n'emergency' existed.<br />\nThe special cases of sit-ins and other similar<br />\nsituations were very thoroughly discussed. The<br />\nCommittee considered that the best chance of<br />\npreventing escalation on campus, or unnecessary<br />\nrecourse to outside authority, would exist if the<br />\nadministrator could, without investing himself with<br />\nspecial powers by virtue of his own assessment<br />\nthat an emergency existed, call for a determination of the case by the following day at the latest.<br />\nThose involved in the alleged misconduct would be<br />\ncertain of a virtually immediate, full hearing and<br />\nwould not be tempted to continue their activity<br />\nbecause of the slowness of the Review process.<br />\nOn the other hand, the administrator would not<br />\nfeel a need for recourse to outside authority simply<br />\nbecause of the length of the delay which would<br />\notherwise be involved.<br />\nIf, in the light of the reasonable declaration,<br />\nwithout<br />\nself-investment with other emergency<br />\npowers, that a hearing would be held by next day at<br />\nthe latest, those involved refused to desist from an<br />\nactivity which, in the opinion of the administration,<br />\nwas actually or potentially dangerous, it would then<br />\nbe possible to turn to the properly constituted civil<br />\nauthorities, if necessary.<br />\nIn the event that the activity was not held to be<br />\ndangerous by the administration, and there was a<br />\nrefusal to desist, this refusal would naturally be<br />\namong the factors taken into consideration by the<br />\nReview Board. If the Board upheld the recommendation of suspension, and its judgement was not<br />\nrespected by those involved, then, in the light of<br />\na full and calm public discussion of the issues, it<br />\nwould again be possible for the administration to<br />\nturn, at any subsequent point, to the civil authorities, if that were considered to be in the best interests of the university community.<br />\n18. Page 5. Section II. Number 10.<br />\nThe Committee recognized that in a large proportion of cases an accusation of misconduct did not<br />\noriginate with the administrator concerned in the<br />\ndisciplinary process. The Committee felt that this<br />\nsentence should be added so that any member of<br />\nthe University who alleged the existence of a misconduct which he believed to be serious, but which<br />\nwas not so considered by the administrator concerned, or whose allegation was disbelieved for<br />\nreasons which seemed to him to be invalid, could<br />\nhave a full hearing.<br />\n19. Page 5. Section IV.<br />\nThe Committee believed that all sections of the<br />\nUniversity would expect that the Review Boards<br />\nset up in their name would perform their duties<br />\nhonestly and justly. The Committee saw no reason<br />\nwhy the presiding officer of that community should<br />\nnot also share in that expectation. The document<br />\nshould therefore express this shared confidence<br />\nwithout weakening it by unnecessary qualifications.<br />\nIn the event that the general expectation was not<br />\nmet in some particular and unusual situation, the<br />\nrecognition of the President's legal powers and<br />\nright of veto was adequately expressed in the<br />\npenultimate sentence. Such powers needed no unnecessary emphasis in a document which should<br />\nbe an expression, not of divisive sectional fears,<br />\nbut of the confidence of a united university community in its ability to discipline itself.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 10, 1970_<br />\n44=14111=11=111.111141.1<br />\n<br />\nAngst, The While Man's Burden<br />\nBy BRUCE DRAKE<br />\nIt was just like the movie told it.<br />\nThe place was a typical greasy-spoon<br />\ndrive-in on Route 140 near Westminster.<br />\nIt had the typical baggy waitress with a<br />\nciagarette stuck in the mound of fat that<br />\nwas her face and the excess skin of her<br />\nupper arms hiding her elbows.

Harold LeVander,<br />\nGovernor of Minnesota, testified<br />\nbefore a senate committee that<br />\nhis state was fighting the A.E.C.<br />\nin the courts over which organization, the state government or the<br />\nagency, has final say in the matter<br />\nof atomic pollution.

Though<br />\npresently suffering from a guilty<br />\nconscience and making promises<br />\nto do something, it can be safely<br />\nassumed that American industry<br />\nis going to do as little as possible<br />\nin regulating waste. What is left<br />\nis the government, both state and<br />\nfederal, and the individual.<br />\nBecause of the tangled mess<br />\nthat is now concerned with pollution and environment in the<br />\nfederal bureaucracy, some kind<br />\nof department at the cabinet level<br />\nis inevitable. Such an agency<br />\nwould have to have the authority<br />\nto veto any Federal project or<br />\nthose to which the federal government contributes money. The present year and a half lag in enforcing pollution laws would have to<br />\nbe narrowed. Now the waste from<br />\nindustry must cross interstate<br />\nboundaries before it becomes<br />\nfederal pollution. This limitation<br />\nshould be abolished.<br />\nBecause the automobile presently is the largest contributor<br />\nto air pollution, the internal combustion engine must either be<br />\nabolished or drastically changed.<br />\nTo avoid the former fate,the automobile industry is finally considering seriously the pure petroleum engine and the turbine variety. Water polluters should be<br />\nencouraged, through tax incentives, to reduce waste containing<br />\npoison. If not the government<br />\nmust tax the hell out of them until<br />\nthey submit. The A.E.C. should<br />\neither comply with federal and<br />\n<br />\nstate standards in building public<br />\nutility reactors or peddle their<br />\nblessing elsewhere.<br />\n<br />\nModest Proposals<br />\nStill, after all these things are<br />\naccomplished, the result may be<br />\nthat too little was done too late.<br />\nThere is not even the assurance<br />\nthat such modest proposals will<br />\nbe enacted. What if they are not?<br />\nVisions of the future, by those that<br />\nconcern themselves with environmental quality, range from the<br />\nwearing of oxygen masks in cities<br />\nto the entrapment of too much<br />\ncarbon monoxide in the atmosphere with a resuling melting<br />\nof the polar ice cap. One predictor sees a new ice age, another<br />\nbelieves that at the present rate<br />\nwe will have half our present<br />\nsunshine in another several decades.<br />\nThe most disturbing realization<br />\nfor many is going to be the fact<br />\nthat this abundance our country<br />\nhas created is turning on us and<br />\nis showing us the price which has<br />\nbeen paid. We may have to consume less in the future than we<br />\ndo today. As Representative<br />\nMorris Udall of Arizona put it:<br />\n\"The price of a decent environment may be cars with 60 horsepower engines instead of 360,<br />\nand fewer gadgets and higher taxes.

The Jays were up by as many as six points but<br />\n<br />\nDrexel cut it to two as the buzzer sounded. Both teams<br />\nwere ice cold from the floor, as the 14-12 half-time score<br />\nindicates. Drexel hit on only five of twenty shots, while<br />\nJohns Hopkins managed to put in four of their eighteen.<br />\nThe difference was on the foul line, where the Blue Jays<br />\noutscored Drexel 6-2. In the first period, Hopkins committed but one personal foul and played a very tough defense.<br />\n<br />\nAction Picks Up<br />\nThe second half brought on more shooting, and many<br />\nmore fouls. Hopkins led 16-12 after one minute was<br />\nplayed, but Drexel connected on 2 field goals and 5 free<br />\nthrows to spurt ahead 21-17. It stayed ahead for most of<br />\nhalf, taking advantage of 3, 5, and 8 point leads.<br />\n<br />\nLebanon Valley, however, dominated the second half of<br />\nplay, taking the lead immediately and increasing it steadily.<br />\nThomas' shooting cooled off and Valley took a 12-5 edge<br />\nfrom the charity stripe.<br />\nGrimberg and Thomas played well, scoring 21 and 17<br />\npoints, respectively. Andy Lynch pulled down 12 rebounds<br />\nto lead in that department, while Apple picked up 5 assists.<br />\nHopkins plays three home games in succession beginning<br />\nThursday night when they host Ursinus. The Jays must win<br />\nto stay in contention for a play-off spot. Coach Valvano<br />\nstill is optomistic, saying only, \"We'll be back!\"<br />\n<br />\nWith about four minutes left in the game, a basket by<br />\nforward Hal Grinberg brought Hopkins within one, and a<br />\nminute later George Apple put the Jays in the lead. Drexel<br />\nproceeded to can a field goal and four foul shots before<br />\nHopkins could add another score and went ahead 43-39 with<br />\none minute to go. Geoff Thomas converted a pair from the<br />\nfree throw line and John Lally hit a two-pointer to bring<br />\nthe Blue Jays back to a one point deficit. Lally hit for two<br />\nagain, but Drexel's Kircher scored his only points of the<br />\nnight to spoil a great comeback effort by Hopkins.<br />\nApple led Hopkins' scorers with 9 points,followed Hal<br />\nGrinberg with 7. Grinberg and big Andy Lynch shared<br />\nrebounding honors with seven.<br />\n<br />\nLebanon Valley Stuns Jays<br />\nIn an earlier away game, Lebanon Valley also had a<br />\ngood second half and surprised the Blue Jays with a 7962 win. Valley had a poor record, but Coach Valvano had<br />\nsaid they had jplayed some good games.<br />\nz<br />\n<br />\nThe first half was close, as the lead switched hands<br />\nsix times. Geoff Thomas lead the Hopkins offense in the<br />\nopening period with 13 points, hitting on 50%of his shots.<br />\n<br />\n.Imminimum<br />\n<br />\nGary llandleman. sophomore guard from Baltimore. is among<br />\nthe leaders in scoring on the Ilopkins cage squad.<br />\n<br />\nTowson Tops Hop Grapplers<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Saturday night, the Blue<br />\nJay wrestlers dropped a meet<br />\nagainst Towson State by the score<br />\nof 31-9, thus making their overall<br />\nrecord three wins and four losses, and their Mason-Dixon Conference standing, 2-1.<br />\nThe high points of the match<br />\nfor Hopkins were Turshen's 5-1<br />\ndecision over Marchiano,Betta's<br />\n3-1 decision over Hutchinson<br />\n(despite an injured knee in the last<br />\nperiod), and Captain Jack Hanemann's match (9-8), everything<br />\nseemed to go downhill for the<br />\nteam from then on.<br />\nAt 158, Vernon Myers got pinned by Grosyknowski of Towson,<br />\nwhile Chuck Ryland lost to Lobus<br />\nby the score of 16-11. Then to<br />\nfinish the match, Sanborn and<br />\nCapp were pinned, while Nick<br />\nPratt had to forfeit in the middle<br />\nof his match, after being injured<br />\nin the shoulder.<br />\n<br />\nJays Drop Haverford Match<br />\nEarlier in the week, Hopkins<br />\nlost to a strong Haverford team by<br />\nthe score of 34-6.

Western Maryland currently has a re-<br />\n<br />\ncord of 11-0, having beaten such<br />\nschools as Old Dominion and<br />\nDelaware Valley, and having won<br />\nboth the Western Maryland Tournament and Quad this year. Not<br />\nonly is this season's record impressive, but the team has also<br />\nwon 23 state dual meets without a<br />\nloss.<br />\nThe team can boast such wrestlers as Ron Schmertzler, twotim Delaware State Champion and<br />\nan All-American in high school,<br />\n<br />\nwho wrestles anywhere from 167<br />\nlbs. up. The heavyweights are<br />\nvery strong, in addition to such<br />\nlighter weights as Gary Shohl,<br />\nwho only lost once in high school.<br />\nCaptain Konover, and a much<br />\nImproved<br />\nwrestler,<br />\nWilliam<br />\nBlake.

Gordon's<br />\ninitial proposal was to have two<br />\nstudents, two faculty members,<br />\nand one administrator.<br />\nIn a spirit of compromise, the<br />\nSAC proposed to have four students, two faculty members, and<br />\none administrator, thus allowing,<br />\nan administrator (as Gordon desired), while leaving the students<br />\nin the majority.

Both resolutions were<br />\nformally moved by Bob Heile, and passed by the Board.<br />\nOn the issue of housing for undergraduate female transfer students, the Executive Board expressed great dissatisfaction with President Gordon's course of<br />\naction.<br />\nDean Swanson's Ad Hoc Committee on<br />\nCoeducation met with the Housing Committee and decided that housing the transfers in the undergraduate dormitories<br />\nwould be the best policy. The Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee was informed by the administration that Dr. Gordon found this proposal unacceptable. Gordon felt that the<br />\ncost of converting the dorms for women<br />\nwas prohibitive. He decided on taking<br />\nover part of McCoy Hall for the transfer<br />\nwomen.<br />\nAfter hearing from Gordon,the Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee informed the Housing Committee that their help was not needed.<br />\nThis was done before the Housing Committee could consult with the Committee<br />\non Student Affairs, which it must consult<br />\nbefore making decisions. The SA had also'<br />\ndecided that the dorms were the best<br />\nplace in which to house the transfers.<br />\nCotter expressed anger' over the fact<br />\nthat Gordon was decided upon using McCoy before ever going through the<br />\nmotions on consulting the various committees. He maintained that Gordon was<br />\nplanning the details of using McCoy before any committee had expressed an<br />\nopinion on the issue.<br />\nIn defense of the use of the dorms,<br />\nCotter revealed the results of an unofficial poll among residents of the upper-<br /><br />\nclass houses. The majority of those interviewed said that they would be willing<br />\nto move out, in order to let women have<br />\nthe rooms. The Board members agree<br />\nthat no conversion of the dorms would<br />\nbe necessary, especially since the construction of a women's dorm (planned<br />\nfor the near future) would necessitate<br />\nreconversion.<br />\nIn light of these facts,Cotter introduced a resolution that two undergraduate<br />\ndorms be temporarily converted for use<br />\nby women, until a new women's dorm is<br />\nbuilt.

While<br />\nciting \"unique opportunities in the past,\"<br />\nhe felt that Hopkins would gain \"no real<br />\ntangible benefits\" from NSA membership<br />\nat the present time. He felt that any<br />\ndecision on future membership would<br />\nhave to be made on the basis of the<br />\n\"financial situation of NSA and if they<br />\ncan offer anything to the school.\"<br />\nThe NSA was the organization whose<br />\nfinancial ties to the CIA were exposed<br />\ntwo years ago. Most people thought the<br />\norganization was finished when LBJ<br />\nfinally ordered the CIA to cut it out,<br />\nsettle accounts, and to let the students<br />\npay their own bills. The president of NSA<br />\nat that time, Gene Groves, conceded that<br />\nthe revelation would \"make the work of<br />\nNSA difficult, if not impossible.\"<br />\nNSA has had a hard time. First student governments at big campuses like<br />\nMichigan, Chicago, and Wisconsin<br />\ncleansed themselves of membership post<br />\nhaste. Then with the rise of more militant confrontation-style student politics,<br />\nthe liberal government agencies and the<br />\nfoundations decided to step out.<br />\nBy April 1 la.<br />\nst year things had gotten<br />\nso bad at the NSA townhouse between<br /><br />\nGeorgetown and the Washington ghetto<br />\nthat bankruptcy seemed imminent. \"On<br />\nApril 1, NSA's bank account was $7500<br />\noverdrawn, we had not paid payroll tax<br />\nfor the first quarter of the year (which<br />\nwas $20,000), our phone bill of $10,000<br />\nwas 60 days overdue, and our total<br />\ndebt equaled $318,000,\" one of last<br />\nyear's administrative staff members<br />\nrecalls.<br />\nThe End of NSA, as simple as it may<br />\nseem, has always been a question fraught<br />\nwith a complex of unexpected consequences. Critics have long claimed that the<br />\nmain thing that keeps NSA going is the<br />\nplatform it offers student politicos for<br />\nentering graduate schools, the government, and academic associations like<br />\nthe American Council on Education.<br />\nNot the least of the<br />\ncharges comes<br />\nfrom Jim Sutton, just resigned Executive Vice President. Not only does he<br />\nthink NSA fails to do much for students,<br />\nbut he believes it ought to fold so that<br />\nsmall legitimate associations might grow<br />\nup in its place. He adds, \"When I started (in September) I wanted NSA to fold,<br />\nso we could start new things out in the<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nSutton says he was brought to NSA<br />\nas a \"foundation man\", i.e., someone<br />\nto translate program ideas into proposals for foundation funding and to lubbricate connections between foundation<br />\nand Association officers.

One would think the days past,<br />\nwhen freshmen would seriously entertain the notion that<br />\nthey could not \"make it\" socially without the aid of a<br />\nfraternity.<br />\nThere is no single reason why the fraternity system is on<br />\nthe decline. Perhaps there is less desire to kill off one's<br />\nconsciousness in orgiastic revelry; perhaps the phenomenon<br />\ncalled \"privatism\" is causing fraternities to fold; certainly<br />\nthe replacement of beer with drugs has a lot to do with the<br />\ndecline of the system. Regardless of the reasons, it is becoming more and more apparent that fraternity affiliation<br />\nis no more a social necessity at Hopkins than a raccoon<br />\ncoat.<br />\nIn light of this, it was particularly galling to hear the<br />\nline that a brother in a Charles Street House was feeding to<br />\na freshman. Last Friday, the brother assured his guest that<br />\n\"Some guys can make it as independents, but if you want<br />\nwomen,joining a good house is really the only way!\"<br />\nThere is no doubt that for some students, fraternity life<br />\noffers certain advantages. And it is unfortunate that three<br />\nof the better houses folded last year. For students who<br />\nwant to join a fraternity, there is now even less diversity<br />\nand less choice. But any statement regarding fraternities as<br />\na social necessity is simply untrue. A fraternity is a luxury<br />\nand an expensive one at that.<br />\nThis is readily apparent to most freshmen who have come<br />\nout of their rooms during the first semester. Perhaps the<br />\nbrothers would do better to drop their \"hype\" tactics and<br />\nattempt to tell the truth. Only in that way will they be able<br />\nto save their societies from complete ruin. The alternative<br />\nis pledging only those freshmen who swallow all the bullshit of rush, a prospect at which even the most die-hard<br />\nrushers wince.<br />\nTHE WIZARD OF ID<br />\nr<br />\nHAVE<br />\nTERRIBLE<br />\nHANGovg!<br /><br />\nC Field Enterprises, Inc., 1970<br /><br />\nFeb. 10, 1970<br /><br />\nOlander<br /><br />\nil<br /><br />\nBy CHRISTOPHER OLANDER<br />\nIf the environment is caught in an ever higher<br />\nspiral of destruction and abuse, then what can the<br />\nspecies that made it so do about it? There are<br />\ncertainly rumblings in the voting public (say government officials) that have been deluged in recent<br />\nmonths with letters and telegrams. The students<br />\ntoo, the media reports, are onthe warpath against<br />\nthe scandalous misuse of natural resources and<br />\npollution of the environment. At one university,<br />\nstudents in a new environmental action group buried an automobile engine just as others once buried<br />\nsmall coffins to protest another immorality. The<br />\ngreatest fear, though, is that the environment as<br />\nVietnam before it will be a forgotten cause, one to<br />\nwhich the low attention span of the American people will only briefly pay homage.<br />\nThere has been a beginning which, to be fair,<br />\nmust be acknowledged. In the state of Maine, the<br />\nlegislature last week passed unamimously a measure by which an Environmental Commission is<br />\nestablished. This has been done before with little<br />\nsuccess. The difference in the Maine commission<br />\nis that it has authority to protect the coast of that<br />\nstate. ThE commission has virtual control over<br />\nsites for industrial development.In order to clean<br />\nup damage already done by oil seepage, the commission is empowered to levy a tax on all oil that<br />\npasses through the state.<br /><br />\nDeleterious Effect<br />\nAt the other end of the Eastern seabord,another<br />\nfight waged by the conservationists has beenwon.<br />\nThe Florida Everglades,long threatened by a noisy<br />\nand fumeous jet-port, were saved by direct intervention from Washington. The President(whether<br />\nbecause of committment or pressure is unclear)<br />\nstopped all federal funds destined for the project.<br />\nThe incredibly deleterious effect such a project<br /><br />\nwould have had on the wildlife in that natural sanctuary raised an outcry from naturalists that residents-soon picked up.<br />\nOne cannot imagine, however, that every time a<br />\nthreat to the environment occurs some noble<br />\nscientist is going to raise a balled fist and lead a<br />\ncharge up the steps of some government building.<br />\nFirst of all, there are too many threats to the environment and too few conservationists; secondly,<br />\nthe public cannot realistically be expected to fight<br />\nsuch battles with the regularity that would be required. Since there is no magical formula, what can<br />\nbe done?<br />\nThe word \"law\" connotes flexibility, due proc.iss and the ability of polluters to tie cases up<br />\nin the courts for a millenia. The word which everyone in this free society, especially government and<br />\nbusiness leaders, is trying to avoid and which<br />\nsmacks of totalitarian regimentation is \"control.\"<br /><br />\nHopelessly Fragmented<br />\nTotal, inflexible control is what is necessary to<br />\nstop pollution and prevent its recurrence. Unfortunately, the governmental agencies which presently deal with pollution are so structured as to<br />\nprevent any solution at all. The Secretary of Health,<br />\nEducation and Welfare, Robert Finch, has called<br />\nthe efforts at control to date\"hopelessly fragmented.\" For instance, Mr. Finch's agency is in charge<br />\nof air pollution and solid waste disposal and is<br />\narmed with a vast number of shockingly impotent<br />\nlaws. The Interior Department, under the leadership of that paragon of conservation Wally Hickel,<br />\nis in charge of water pollution. The Atomic energy<br />\nCommission, probably the most self-serving<br />\norganizqtion<br />\nin the<br />\nentire<br />\nUnited States<br />\ngovernment, theoretically regulates the pollution which emanates from atomic reactors<br />\nin the form of thermal heat.<br />\n(continued on page 5)<br /><br />\nLetters To The<br />\nEditors<br />\nLOVE IT OR LEAVE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThese are times of great turmoil on our campuses. Contributing to this turmoil has been<br />\nthe too-often ignored concept of<br />\n\"president unrest\". It is instructive to examine this at Hopkins (since here the example is<br />\nmuch clearer and may well serve<br />\nas a model for other campuses).<br />\nWe may then attempt to discover<br />\nunderlying the<br />\nreasons<br />\nthe<br />\nalienation of our university presidents, in their frustrated attempts to become \"relevant\" to<br />\nthe world outside them.<br />\nA number of events seem to<br />\npoint out that such a person, despite the constant rhetoric of relating to the university community, is simply interested in<br />\nthe idea of \"presidential power\".<br />\nTo me this demand seems quite<br />\nunreasonable, since for the most<br /><br />\npart, they have no real stake in<br />\nthe university. For while the faculty and students may have a<br />\npermanent commitment to the<br />\nacademic community, what commitment can a man have, who is<br />\nbusy with his work in the OAS,or<br />\nwho might even be offered an ambassadorship in some far-off<br />\nland?<br /><br />\nsity.

He complains that the<br />\nregular channels, which we have<br />\nso carefully built up over the<br />\nyears, no longer work.

Introduction<br />\nTo attempt to define rules of conduct in terms of<br />\nspecific forms of misconduct is to risk omissions<br />\nand to provoke a series of after-the-fact amendments<br />\nthat weaken the force of the original policy statement.<br />\nRather, it is preferable that such rules be stated in<br />\nterms of the general characteristics which identify<br />\nsuch classes of behavior, and that fair procedural<br />\narrangements provide for their application to specific<br />\ncases. The University's methods should be those of<br />\nrational inquiry and dialogue. Thus, the application<br />\nof behavioral sanctions to its students is an inherently<br />\ndistasteful process. However, traditional dependence<br />\non self-discipline by members of the academic community does not in fact always prevent actions prejudicial to the rights of others. Every university is<br />\ntherefore compelled to seek policies and procedures<br />\nthat ensure its integrity as a social institution. In<br />\ndoing so, however, it must be mindful of the interests and rights of its members, must uphold the right<br /><br />\n11. The Sanction of Suspension<br />\nThe sanction of suspension may be recommended<br />\nby the chief administrative officer of the Division or<br />\nhis designated representative but the sanction shall<br />\nbe applied only on the basis of a hearing for the student charged with misconduct by an ad hoc Review<br />\nBoard composed of students and members of the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nSuspension shall be the most severe sanction used<br />\nby the University and may be imposed for whatever<br />\nperiod is considered to be appropriate in a particular<br />\ncase. Where suspension is for a period longer than<br />\none year the student shall have the right to an annual<br />\nappeal to the Review Board for reinstatement.<br />\nThe hearing shall be conducted in conformity with<br />\nthe following principles.<br /><br />\nJanuary 5, 1970<br />\nPresident Lincoln Gordon<br />\nHomewood House<br />\nCampus<br />\nDear President Gordon:<br />\nI enclose for your consideration the recommendations<br />\nof the Committee on Student Affairs regarding the<br />\nProposed Statement on Student Conduct, together with<br />\na Summary of some of the more important reasons<br />\nfor its divergence from the documents which were<br />\nlaid before the Committee. The amendments were,<br />\nas you know, arrived at during a full semester of discussion by a Committee which, for the first time, had<br />\namong its members the elected chief representatives<br />\nof the Graduate and Undergraduate bodies. All the<br />\nrecommended changes were arrived at and agreed in<br />\nfull committee by majority or unanimous votes. The<br />\ncomposition of the committee is such that in fact all<br />\nthe majorities involved contained both student and<br />\nfaculty or administration members. The accompanying supplement, on the other hand, was, for convenience, drafted by the Chairman of the Committee in<br />\nconsultation with various individual members and<br />\nsubsequently passed by the full corn mittee,with minor<br />\nrecommendations, as representing a reasonable<br />\nattempt to elucidate some of the main points at issue.<br />\nIf anything remains unclear, both the Committee as a<br />\ngroup and I myself individually would be only too<br />\nhappy to try to resolve the difficulty.<br />\nFinally, I<br />\nshould like to thank you, together with Dr. Bevan and<br />\nDr. Kimball, for your courtesy in coming to meet the<br />\nCommittee and in discussing the various major problems with it.<br />\nYours sincerely,<br />\nJohn White<br />\nChairman, Committee on<br />\nStudent Affairs<br /><br />\nResolved that the Committee on Student Affairs advises that the Proposed Policy Statement on Student<br />\nConduct should be amended to take the following<br />\nform, and be accompanied by the appended Supplement.<br /><br />\nto approproiate sanctions consists of conduct that<br />\nabridges the rights of other individuals or groups,<br />\nespecially as it affects the educational goals of those<br />\nwithin the University community, or threatens their<br />\nsafety, health, or property, or conduct that causes<br />\ndamage to physical facilities of the University.<br />\nADDENDUM 2 for effect on the Homewood<br />\nCampus:<br />\nConduct which might be construed as coming under the above heading, but which was<br />\npreviously within the jurisdiction of the Honor<br />\nCommission, shall remain within that jurisdiction.

Both faculty<br />\nand student members felt that platonic general<br />\nstatements frequently did not meet with the reaction expected by those making them, and tended<br />\n1.<br /><br />\nto appear hypocritical to many in the face of certain fairly common aspects of the actualities of<br />\nuniversity life.<br />\nThese criticisms did not apply with the same<br />\nforce if the same or very similar statements<br />\nwere applied to particular circumstances.<br />\nIt was also felt that a document on student<br />\nconduct should get to the point as quickly as<br />\npossible.<br />\nIn the light of these considerations, the order of<br />\npage 1 of the President's statement was altered,<br />\nand all statements in the document were made to<br />\n-efer to the matter at hand; namely, Rules of<br />\nStudent Conduct.<br />\n3. Page 1. Paragraph 1. Line 11. Rights.<br />\nHere, as at some subsequent points in the document, the references to the interests and rights<br />\nof others (page 2, line 4) were shortened to 'the<br />\nrights of others'.<br />\nIt was pointed out that a university is, like any<br />\ncommunity, necessarily one in which there are<br />\nmany conflicting interests. Defining those interests and deciding on priorities between them<br />\nin many possible cases of reasonable conflict was<br />\nconsidered to be a hopeless task which would only<br />\nlead to disagreement and confusion. On the other<br />\nhand, while the definition of rights might be no<br />\nless difficult in some respects, it was felt that<br />\nthose rights, however defined, would in the context<br />\nof rules of conduct, be common to all and therefore<br />\nnot liable to lead to the same degree of controversy.<br />\n4. Page 1. Paragraph 1. Penultimate line. Free<br />\nSpeech<br />\nA positive reference to the right of free speech<br />\nwas added primarily because the document would<br />\nundoubtedly circulate outside the University community and come to the attention of individuals or<br />\ngroups whose understanding of the implications of<br />\nthe principle, or of its application in the context<br />\nunder discussion, might not be as clear as was that<br />\nof members of the university.<br />\n5. Page 1. Addendum 1. Homewood Campus<br />\nThe Committee was unanimous that, as a matter<br />\nof principle it was better to consult before rather<br />\nthan after the event.<br />\nIt was felt that unless there was consultation before rather than after the making of major policy<br />\ndecisions, the likelihood of unnecessary crises<br />\nwould be increased.<br />\nFinally, since all sections of the University<br />\nwould be involved in the appeals mechanism, it<br />\nwould be wise to involve all sections in the establishment of the policies with the implementation<br />\nand contravention of which any Review Board would<br />\nhave to deal.<br />\nSince the Committee on Student Affairs would<br />\nno longer have to act as the Review Board and<br />\nwould be wholly separate from it, it seemed that<br />\nit was the only appropriate forum involving faculty, students, and administration within the existing university machinery which could advise on<br />\nsuch matters pending the establishment of a Senate<br />\nor other similar body.<br />\n6. Page 2. Behavior Subject to Sanctions<br />\nIn Section 1 of the President's Draft, the word<br />\n'interests' was struck for the reasons given above<br />\n(Section 3). The word 'welfare' was deleted because it appeared to be redundent. There appear-<br /><br />\ned to be no significant category of misconduct covered by it which would not be already covered by<br />\nthe rights of others or threats to safety, health,<br />\nproperty or damage to the physical facilities of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nAs regards the proposed amendment, the Committee felt that the basis of conduct in a university is concern for the rights of others. The<br />\nphrase 'other individuals or groups' was seen<br />\nas covering both the university community and<br />\nlarger<br />\nthe<br />\ncommunity of which it is a part.<br />\n'Groups' was taken to cover formal and institutional groups as well as informal groups. Thus,<br />\na student who misrepresented his academic record at Johns Hopkins in order to obtain entry<br />\nto another University would be abridging the rights<br />\nof the Hopkins community and of its individual<br />\nmembers to their good name and to their reputation for trustworthiness, and to their right to a<br />\nfair representation of their competitive standing.<br />\nHe would also be abriding the right of the other<br />\nuniversity community to expect true information<br />\nfrom a member of the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe opening phrase of the passage on conduct<br />\nsubject to sanction was closed by a comma in<br />\norder to establish its general significance and<br />\napplication. The succeeding phrases then amplify its import in relation to the Hopkins community, spelling out certain major categories of rights<br />\nwhich must be safeguarded.<br />\nThe phrase 'conduct that disrupts the normal<br />\nfunctioning of the university' was deleted because<br />\nit was found to have no substantial and specific<br />\nmeaning, and thus was liable to be applied to any<br />\nsituation which some particular section of the<br />\nUniversity found offensive. A University houses<br />\na great many interests and there is continuous<br />\ncompetition for use of university facilities in serThus, the university<br />\nvice of these interests.<br />\ntypically functions in a highly elastic manner,<br />\nyeilding, in the course of its daily functioning,<br />\nto this special interest at the expense of that<br />\none, displacing old programs with new ones, cancelling a scheduled event to accomodate an unforeseen circumstance, etc. Thus, what someone would call a disruption of the \"normal\"<br />\nfunction of the University, someone else quite<br />\nlegitimately would call an integral part of the \"normal\" function of the University.<br />\nThus, making \"disruption of the normal function<br />\nof the University\" a culpable category of behavior<br />\nis likely to encourage, or allow, particular sections of the University to define as \"normal\"<br />\nwhatever they like and to define as \"disruptive\"<br />\nanything which they dislike that competes for<br />\nUniversity facilities.<br />\nFurthermore, any cases of \"disruption of the<br />\nnormal function of the University\" which constitute genuine interference on the part of one<br />\ngroup or individual with the right of another<br />\ngroup or individual are covered by the phrase<br />\n\"interference with the rights of others,\" which<br />\nis the central culpable category in the document.<br />\nIn the special case of political protest, which<br />\nis only one of the many possible interests covered by the document, in which misconduct may<br />\noccur, it is especially important for the health<br />\nof the University community, as for that of the<br /><br />\nFeb. 10, 1970<br /><br />\nDRAFT<br />\nTHE STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CONDUCT<br /><br />\nA NEWS-LETTER SUPPLEMENT<br /><br />\nAlso Demands 4-2-1 Review Board Composition<br />\ncommunity at large, that actions connected with<br />\nsuch activities must, in order to be culpable, be<br />\nshown to constitute an abridgement of the rights<br />\nof others.<br />\nSection 3 of the proposal set before the Committee was omitted entirely because it appeared<br />\nto be covered by the wording of the proposed amendment in a way which was far less open to<br />\nmisinterpretation, particularly by individuals and<br />\nbodies outside the University.<br />\nAs it stood, Section 3 was strongly felt to be<br />\nExtremely ambiguous and potentially very dangerous to the interests of the University as a whole,<br />\nand not merely to those of its student members.<br /><br />\nSUMMARY<br />\nIt was recognized that no brief statement could<br />\nby its nature be precise in its implications. For<br />\nthe most part, the university would be dependent<br />\nupon the wisdom and common sense of the Review<br />\nBoards which established or confirmed precedents<br />\ncase by case. The Committee was therefore concerned to reduce to the minimum the inevitable<br />\nambiguity or area of uncertainty involved in such<br />\na statement. It was of the opinion that this could<br />\nbetter be done by the establishment of a single<br />\nPrinciple, with some subsequent description of specific areas of concern, than by accumulating a series<br />\nof statements each of which was ambiguous both in<br />\nitself and in the nature of its relationship to the<br />\nPreceding necessarily imprecise statements.<br />\n7. Page 2. Addendum 2. Section 1 Homewood Campus<br />\nSince all the forms of misconduct at presentwithin<br />\nthe jurisdiction of the Honor Commission could be<br />\nconstrued as falling within the broad class of behavior subject to sanction which was described in<br />\nthe preceding paragraph, the effect would be to<br />\ncreate a clash of jurisdictions or else to abolish<br />\nthe Honor Commission unless this sentence was<br />\nadded.<br />\nIt was felt that the existence or otherwise of the<br />\nHonor Commission was a separate issue requiring considerable investigation and discussion, and<br />\nthe Committee did not wish to disturb a functioning<br />\nInstitution unless there was clear evidence that it<br />\nwas desirable to do so.<br />\n8. Page 2. Addendum 2.Sentence 2. Homewood Campus<br />\nThis was added to bring Honor Commission sanctions into line with those proposed in Section II,<br />\nparagraph 2 on page 3.<br />\nPage 2. Final Paragraph of Section 1. Last<br />\n9.<br />\nsentence. Extenuating Circumstances<br />\nIt was recognized that it was important to stress<br />\nthat extenuating circumstances should be carefully<br />\nconsidered in view of the guide-lines established<br />\nIn the opening paragraph of the Introduction. References to the appellants 'motivation' and to<br />\n'Impelling circumstance' seemed, however, to open<br />\nthe door to grave difficulties of interpretation even<br />\nif they did not actually encourage certain types of<br />\nundesirable action. A simple reference to extenuating circumstances was therefore preferred.<br />\n10. Page 2. Section II. Paragraph's 2 and 3. Suspension<br />\nIn the light of the references to 'rational dialogue', 'humane tradition', etc. incorporated in the<br />\nIntroduction, and taken over from both previous<br />\ndrafts of the Proposed Statement, the Committee<br /><br />\nfelt that the sanction of explusion should be abolished.<br />\nMaking suspension the most severe sanction applicable would place the emphais on the possibility of<br />\nsocial education and rehabilitation rather than on<br />\nthe purely punitive aspect of sanctions, and would<br />\nnot imply that certain types of behavior were irredeemable.<br />\nThe University's need to protect itself would be as<br />\nfully safeguarded by suspension as by explusion<br />\nprovided that no limit was set on the term for<br />\nwhich suspension could be applied.<br />\nIt was recognized that the right to annual appeal<br />\nmight occasionally result in appeals which were<br />\nessentially frivolous, but such appeals could be<br />\nrapidly dealt with once a year and need cause no<br />\nserious administrative problem.<br />\n11. Page 3. Section II. Number 1. Composition of<br />\nthe Board<br />\nAfter considering the President's proposal, along<br />\nwith many other possible combinations, the Committee came to the conclusion that the proposal<br />\nput forward by the Ad Hoc Committee composed<br />\nof three senior administrators, four members of<br />\nthe faculty, and three students, was the soundest<br />\nproposal in the light of all the factors to be considered.<br />\nThe Ad Hoc Committee's proposal was only<br />\nmodified by specifying<br />\n(a) that there should be two graduate and<br />\ntwo undergraudate students instead of<br />\nmerely an undifferentiated total of four<br />\nstudents.<br />\nthat the chairman should be chosen by<br />\nvote of the board from the whole membership and not be an appointed student.<br />\nThis change was made in order to allow<br />\nthe board freedom to choose the best<br />\nchairman that it could from among its<br />\nmembers, and also to limit the influence<br />\nof the administration which was already<br />\nrepresented on the board, which was responsible for bringing charges before the<br />\nboard, and which held the final power of<br />\nveto over its decisions.<br />\nThe Reason for rejecting the alternative proposal that the chairman should<br />\nbe chosen by lot was that the random<br />\nselection of the board was, in itself a<br />\nsufficient safe-guard. In view of the<br />\nall inclusive nature of the pools from<br />\nwhich members were to be drawn, the<br />\nneed to have the best possible chairman was felt to be an overriding consideration. Conversely, any reduction<br />\nof the size of the pools would lead to<br />\nthe danger that the board, or sections<br />\nof it, might become unrepresentative<br />\nsamples of the groups concerned and<br />\ntend to favor particular interests.<br />\n(c) that the administrative representative<br />\nshould not be an appointee of the administrative head of the division concerned and therefore of the administrator ultimately responsible for charges brought before the board. It was<br />\nheld to be undesirable to place the administrative representative in the ano-<br /><br />\n(b)<br /><br />\nmalous position of being directly responsible to the prosecution by viture of<br />\nappointment and of at the same time<br />\nbeing expected to act as an impartial<br />\njudge. The proposed alteration would<br />\nplace the administrator on an equal<br />\nfooting with all other members of the<br />\nboard.<br />\nThe Committee felt that there was no<br />\nforce in the argument put foward in the<br />\nPresident's covering letter, that a body<br />\nlarger than five would be difficult to<br />\nbring together. This would only be true<br />\nin the case of a committee or board of<br />\nlimited, fixed membership. Since the<br />\nproposed board was to be drawn from<br />\nlarge pools of eligible individuals, the<br />\ninability of any particular nominee to<br />\nattend would cause no difficulty, as another could be asked to serve in his<br />\nplace.<br />\nThe Committee saw the force of the<br />\nargument that, all things being equal,<br />\nno section of the community should hold<br />\na majority in matters affecting all sections. It was also conscious of the fact<br />\nthat all things were by no means equal<br />\nin the present context. Its attention was<br />\ndrawn to the fact that no such principle<br />\nwas operative elsewhere in the University. The decisions of the Academic<br />\nCouncil could be held to be of interest<br />\nto the University as whole, and not least<br />\nto students, yet the faculty held an overwhelming majority on it and no students<br />\nwere represented. The whole University<br />\ncertainly had an interest in the honesty<br />\nof students and the fairness and reliability of grading, but the Honor Commission was wholly composed of students.<br />\nIndeed, if there were a principle which<br />\nseemed to be fairly generally operative<br />\nin the structure of the University, it<br />\nwould seem to be that the section of the<br />\ncommunity most directly concerned tended to have a preponderance in numbers<br />\nover any other section, and most often<br />\nheld an absolute majority.<br />\nIn the present case, the Review Board<br />\nwas to be set up with a view to regulating student conduct alone, and was not<br />\nconcerned with the conduct of other<br />\nsections of the University. Although<br />\nany section of the University might initiate proceedings, the administration<br />\nwould in effect act as prosecutor before<br />\nthe board, would have a representative<br />\non the board, and would have the final<br />\nright of veto. To maintain a reasonable balance within such a three part<br />\nsystem, it seemed right that the peers<br />\nof those to be accused should have a<br />\nslight preponderance in the second or<br />\njudicial stage. The aim of the University in. setting up its disciplinary institutions should be to held its inroads<br />\n(continued on following page)<br /><br />\nto demand that President Gordon withdraw his proposal of January 26<br />\nLast week's meeting of the Graduate Student Organization. The GS0 is also a firm backer of the SA's proposal, and voted unanimously<br />\nphoto by !mitt<br />\nright.<br />\nthe<br />\nfrom<br />\nthird<br />\nis<br />\nPresident,<br />\nCotter,<br />\nand accept the committee's recommendations. Robert<br /><br />\nA NEWS-LETTER SUPPLEMENT<br /><br />\nTHE STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CONDUCT DRAFT<br /><br />\nFeb.10,1970<br /><br />\nDraft Provided Backbone of Gordon's Version<br />\n(continued from preceding page)<br />\non the principle of self-discipline enunciated in the Introduction to the unavoidable minimum. The suggested composition of the Review Board, therefore, was<br />\nheld to be desirable in principle, but was<br />\nalso most likely in practice to ensure<br />\nthe respect and trust of that section of<br />\nthe University community which would<br />\nalone be brought before it.<br />\nFor somewhat. similar reasons it was<br />\nfelt that an administrator should be<br />\nassociated with the judicial proceedings<br />\nby a process of random selection, in spite<br />\nof the involvement of administrators at<br />\nthe other two stages of the three-part<br />\nprocedure. It was felt that the prime<br />\nconsideration was that the administration should feel that its interests had been<br />\nrepresented and that it should not be<br />\nable to disassociate itself from any verdict which might be rendered by the Review Board.<br />\nFinally, the Committee also supported<br />\nthe conclusion of the Ad Hoc Committee<br />\nas to total membership of the Review<br />\nBoard, which was seven. It was felt that<br />\na slightly larger board than that suggested by the President would be likely to<br />\nbe more stable and a little less liable to<br />\nbe unduly affected by the peculiarities of<br />\nany individual who might be placed on it<br />\nby the process of random selection.<br />\n12. Page 3. SectionII.Number 4. Calling of Witnesses<br />\nThe word 'consenting' was deleted since, though a<br />\nwitness might be called, he need not, in the absence<br />\nof power of subpoena, appear, and it seemed desirable to do nothing, in the wordingof the document, to<br />\nweaken the expectation that witnesses would appear<br />\nwhen asked to do so.<br />\n13. Page 4. Section II. Number 5. Assistance at<br />\nHearings<br />\nIt seemed unnecessarily divisive of the University<br />\ncommunity to confine assistance at hearings to<br />\nstudents, when a member of the faculty or of the<br />\nadministration might be willing, and better qualified,<br />\nfor one reason or another, to assist a student who<br />\nmight be disadvantaged in some way or otherwise<br />\nfeel himself to be in need of help before the Board.<br />\n14. Page 4. Section II. Number 6. Procedure at<br />\nHearings<br />\nIt was felt desirable, in view of the importance<br />\nof such procedures to the University at large, to<br />\nestablish that hearings should, except at the specific<br />\nrequest of the accused be held in public and that<br />\nin the case of such public hearings all, and not<br />\nmerely some parts of the evidence, should be<br />\nheard in public.<br />\nIt also seemed important to allow the board to<br />\nstate its reasons for its decisions if it so wished,<br />\nand not merely to confine it to a statement of its<br />\ndecision, as was previously proposed.<br />\n15. Page 4. Section II. Number 7. Destruction of<br />\nDocuments<br />\nThe wording of this section was simplified slightly. No special regulation was needed for students<br />\nunder suspension since they would not, technically<br />\nspeaking have 'left' as long as they maintained their<br />\nstatus.<br />\n16. Page 4. Section II. Number 8.<br />\nWhereas the Ad hoc Committee, envisaging a true<br />\nappeals situation, in which the student concerned<br />\nhad the right, if he so desired, to appeal against<br />\nan otherwise valid sentence, established that the<br />\ncase should be heard within ten days, the President's document made no mention of any time<br />\nlimit.<br />\nThe feeling in the committee was that the judicial<br />\nprocess should not only be as open, but as expeditious as possible. It believed that in the case of<br />\nhearings of the type envisaged, which did not involve the full panoply of civil or criminal legal'<br />\nprocess, five working days would be sufficient for<br /><br />\nDr. Steven Mann of the Education Department, one of the<br />\n\"radicals\" of the Committee on Student Affairs. Mann was<br />\nalso a member of the ad hoc committee whiela drew up the<br />\noriginal guidelines for the President's office. photos by leitun<br /><br />\nAlex Sotir, coach and another of the committee's members.<br />\nThe S.A.C. consists of five faculty members and six students.<br />\nany necessary preparations. Particularly in cases<br />\nwhich might touch on the interests of large sections<br />\nof the university or result from group actions, it<br />\nseemed essential not to delay beyond the necessary<br />\nminimum in order, on the one hand, to avoid the<br />\ndanger of escalating involvement, and, on the other,<br />\nto avoid a tendency to declare an emergency when<br />\nno such emergency was actually in existence because<br />\nof a fear of escalation during a lengthy waiting<br />\nperiod.<br />\nThe term 'working days', rather than 'academic<br />\nworking days', was specifically intended to avoid<br />\ninordinate delays in the case of alleged misconduct within a day or so of the end of a semester<br />\nor academic year, or in other similar situations.<br />\n17. Page 4. Section II. Number 9.<br />\nThe Committee believed that the imposition of<br />\nimmediate interim suspension was undesirable.<br /><br />\nThe Committee was acutely aware of the administrative need for swift action in the case of certain types of misconduct. It believed, however,<br />\nthat in all cases involving acute physical danger<br />\nor serious and immediate clanger to property, the<br />\nonly proper line of action was recourse to the<br />\ncivil authorities. The student members of the<br />\nCommittee were particularly insistent that the<br />\nuniversity community should not be insulated from<br />\nthe law of the land, if a proper sense of responsibility was to be achieved.<br />\nIn cases which did not involve imminent danger,<br />\nit ,was felt to be undesirable that the individual<br />\nadministrator, who might be under considerable<br />\npressure of one kind or another, should be able<br />\nto assume power which he would not otherwise<br />\nhave, simply by a unilateral declaration that an<br />\n'emergency' existed.<br />\nThe special cases of sit-ins and other similar<br />\nsituations were very thoroughly discussed. The<br />\nCommittee considered that the best chance of<br />\npreventing escalation on campus, or unnecessary<br />\nrecourse to outside authority, would exist if the<br />\nadministrator could, without investing himself with<br />\nspecial powers by virtue of his own assessment<br />\nthat an emergency existed, call for a determination of the case by the following day at the latest.<br />\nThose involved in the alleged misconduct would be<br />\ncertain of a virtually immediate, full hearing and<br />\nwould not be tempted to continue their activity<br />\nbecause of the slowness of the Review process.<br />\nOn the other hand, the administrator would not<br />\nfeel a need for recourse to outside authority simply<br />\nbecause of the length of the delay which would<br />\notherwise be involved.<br />\nIf, in the light of the reasonable declaration,<br />\nwithout<br />\nself-investment with other emergency<br />\npowers, that a hearing would be held by next day at<br />\nthe latest, those involved refused to desist from an<br />\nactivity which, in the opinion of the administration,<br />\nwas actually or potentially dangerous, it would then<br />\nbe possible to turn to the properly constituted civil<br />\nauthorities, if necessary.<br />\nIn the event that the activity was not held to be<br />\ndangerous by the administration, and there was a<br />\nrefusal to desist, this refusal would naturally be<br />\namong the factors taken into consideration by the<br />\nReview Board. If the Board upheld the recommendation of suspension, and its judgement was not<br />\nrespected by those involved, then, in the light of<br />\na full and calm public discussion of the issues, it<br />\nwould again be possible for the administration to<br />\nturn, at any subsequent point, to the civil authorities, if that were considered to be in the best interests of the university community.<br />\n18. Page 5. Section II. Number 10.<br />\nThe Committee recognized that in a large proportion of cases an accusation of misconduct did not<br />\noriginate with the administrator concerned in the<br />\ndisciplinary process. The Committee felt that this<br />\nsentence should be added so that any member of<br />\nthe University who alleged the existence of a misconduct which he believed to be serious, but which<br />\nwas not so considered by the administrator concerned, or whose allegation was disbelieved for<br />\nreasons which seemed to him to be invalid, could<br />\nhave a full hearing.<br />\n19. Page 5. Section IV.<br />\nThe Committee believed that all sections of the<br />\nUniversity would expect that the Review Boards<br />\nset up in their name would perform their duties<br />\nhonestly and justly. The Committee saw no reason<br />\nwhy the presiding officer of that community should<br />\nnot also share in that expectation. The document<br />\nshould therefore express this shared confidence<br />\nwithout weakening it by unnecessary qualifications.<br />\nIn the event that the general expectation was not<br />\nmet in some particular and unusual situation, the<br />\nrecognition of the President's legal powers and<br />\nright of veto was adequately expressed in the<br />\npenultimate sentence. Such powers needed no unnecessary emphasis in a document which should<br />\nbe an expression, not of divisive sectional fears,<br />\nbut of the confidence of a united university community in its ability to discipline itself.<br /><br />\nPAGE 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nFeb. 10, 1970_<br />\n44=14111=11=111.111141.1<br /><br />\nAngst, The While Man's Burden<br />\nBy BRUCE DRAKE<br />\nIt was just like the movie told it.<br />\nThe place was a typical greasy-spoon<br />\ndrive-in on Route 140 near Westminster.<br />\nIt had the typical baggy waitress with a<br />\nciagarette stuck in the mound of fat that<br />\nwas her face and the excess skin of her<br />\nupper arms hiding her elbows.

Though<br />\npresently suffering from a guilty<br />\nconscience and making promises<br />\nto do something, it can be safely<br />\nassumed that American industry<br />\nis going to do as little as possible<br />\nin regulating waste. What is left<br />\nis the government, both state and<br />\nfederal, and the individual.<br />\nBecause of the tangled mess<br />\nthat is now concerned with pollution and environment in the<br />\nfederal bureaucracy, some kind<br />\nof department at the cabinet level<br />\nis inevitable. Such an agency<br />\nwould have to have the authority<br />\nto veto any Federal project or<br />\nthose to which the federal government contributes money. The present year and a half lag in enforcing pollution laws would have to<br />\nbe narrowed. Now the waste from<br />\nindustry must cross interstate<br />\nboundaries before it becomes<br />\nfederal pollution. This limitation<br />\nshould be abolished.<br />\nBecause the automobile presently is the largest contributor<br />\nto air pollution, the internal combustion engine must either be<br />\nabolished or drastically changed.<br />\nTo avoid the former fate,the automobile industry is finally considering seriously the pure petroleum engine and the turbine variety. Water polluters should be<br />\nencouraged, through tax incentives, to reduce waste containing<br />\npoison. If not the government<br />\nmust tax the hell out of them until<br />\nthey submit.

The Jays were up by as many as six points but<br /><br />\nDrexel cut it to two as the buzzer sounded. Both teams<br />\nwere ice cold from the floor, as the 14-12 half-time score<br />\nindicates. Drexel hit on only five of twenty shots, while<br />\nJohns Hopkins managed to put in four of their eighteen.<br />\nThe difference was on the foul line, where the Blue Jays<br />\noutscored Drexel 6-2. In the first period, Hopkins committed but one personal foul and played a very tough defense.<br /><br />\nAction Picks Up<br />\nThe second half brought on more shooting, and many<br />\nmore fouls.

Drexel<br />\nproceeded to can a field goal and four foul shots before<br />\nHopkins could add another score and went ahead 43-39 with<br />\none minute to go. Geoff Thomas converted a pair from the<br />\nfree throw line and John Lally hit a two-pointer to bring<br />\nthe Blue Jays back to a one point deficit. Lally hit for two<br />\nagain, but Drexel's Kircher scored his only points of the<br />\nnight to spoil a great comeback effort by Hopkins.<br />\nApple led Hopkins' scorers with 9 points,followed Hal<br />\nGrinberg with 7. Grinberg and big Andy Lynch shared<br />\nrebounding honors with seven.<br /><br />\nLebanon Valley Stuns Jays<br />\nIn an earlier away game, Lebanon Valley also had a<br />\ngood second half and surprised the Blue Jays with a 7962 win. Valley had a poor record, but Coach Valvano had<br />\nsaid they had jplayed some good games.<br />\nz<br /><br />\nThe first half was close, as the lead switched hands<br />\nsix times.

Courses for credit were first given in 1909,<br />\nwhen, according to the catalog, a separate division was credted, \"to offer instruction of collegiate grade in professional education and the liberal arts\".<br />\nThe sixty subsequent years brought about<br />\nsome bureaucratic reshufflings, a name<br />\nchange or two, and expansion into a<br />\nwide range of fields.<br /><br />\nKilling By Degrees<br />\n\"The M.A. in Liberal Arts program<br />\nis designed to give a broad exposure to<br />\ndifferent fields in the humanities and<br />\nsciences,\" said Mumma. \"At the core<br />\nof the program are the Seminars in the<br />\nHistory of Ideas, which are conducted<br />\nby Hopkins professors.\" There are 450<br />\npresently enrolled in this program.<br />\nThe College also offers a number of<br />\nnon-credit courses.
