By the time it is<br />\nread, they will probably<br />\nhave elected my successor.<br />\nAnd so I have been sitting here in the dirty office for an hour or more, trying<br />\nto think of a way to close the chapter.

They are bound up with a thousand hours of<br />\naimless, inexpert conversation whiCh still gives no prospect of ever coming to any conclusion. With eating<br />\nhot dogs at Al's Grill and lighting cigars at the blue<br />\nflame on the linotype. With some very drab crusades<br />\nand some very gaudy jokes. But, most of all, with the<br />\npeople I have known and the way they lived and<br />\nthought and talked.<br />\nFor the things I will miss are the things of the<br />\nspirit. As the world judges such matters this may or<br />\nmay not be a rather lousy paper. But, it is the only<br />\npaper I know where the staff could put off reading<br />\nproof to listen to the work of a new poet. Those who<br />\nwork on it may or may not be incompetents. But they<br />\nare young, and they are blessed with hope and a constitutional inability to say yes.

The two projects with<br />\nwhich it is concerning itself\u2014the German refugee student committee, and the Baltimore high school newspaper contest\u2014are progressing apace. The activity<br />\nand interest of the membership evidences which is<br />\n<br />\nNotes<br />\non the<br />\nrebirth<br />\n<br />\nthis was, the group did nothing, despite repeated exhortations.<br />\nWe ask Pi D E once more to do that, which, of<br />\nall things possible in campus journalism at present is<br />\nmost within its precinct. The current renaissance of<br />\nthe fraternity can only if worthwhile if something<br />\nlasting is effected. The opportunity is present and<br />\nknocking.<br />\nIt's silly to belittle the work being carried on at<br />\npresent. Yet there is an absurd aspect to all this<br />\nfeverish activity being conducted along lines of general campus welfare, while direct problems are neglected.<br />\nThere is no question of the place for a magazine<br />\non the campus. But in the investigation of the feasibilty<br />\nand operation of such an undertaking -Pi D E must<br />\ndisplay the initiative.<br />\nWe don't suppose there's<br />\nany reason to get particularly charged up about our<br />\npoll on student government.<br />\nIt's really the Student council's affair.<br />\nBut, to any fair-minded person, the result looks pretty much like a kick in the<br />\nface for our representatives. The campus is in accord<br />\nwith every attempt to curb the powers of the council<br />\nand opposed to every attempt to extend them.<br />\nIn some ways this position is quite logical. There<br />\nis no conceivable reason why the council, as now<br />\nconstituted, should be given direct control over all<br />\nundergraduate activities. Certainly the record of the<br />\npast offers no basis for any confidence in its use of<br />\nsuch a power.<br />\nBut, imperfect instrument that it is, the council<br />\nis still the only 'organization representing the student<br />\nbody before the administration. As such, it is our only<br />\nhonest hope for the establishment of some measure of<br />\ndemocratic control.<br />\nThe proposed re-definition of powers is practical<br />\nonly when it is coupled with measures designed to turn<br />\nstudent government back to the campus. But, even<br />\nlimited .to its present functions, the Council cannot<br />\nescape the necessity of submitting to popular control.<br />\nThe boys have at hand one method of redeeming<br />\nthemselves in the eyes of at least the most articulate<br />\nsection of the campus. They can put into effect the<br />\nvarious controls suggested for their own special functions and thus rn-le possible the fullest participation<br />\nof the undergraduate body in their own affairs.<br />\nIf such a democratic Council should again come<br />\nforward to claim complete jurisdiction over college<br />\nactivities, it would have every right to expect the<br />\nsympathy of its constituents. For there would be no<br />\nbasis for the fears of those timid liberals who have<br />\nhitherto hesitated to support such demands.<br />\nIn orie respect at least, we yield to the Student<br />\ncouncil. There is a certain point beyond which we commence to be sick of sitting around and talking about<br />\ndemocracy. Evidentally, the council hasn't reached<br />\nthat point yet.

At<br />\nthis time, however, let us remember<br />\nthe countless thousands in betrayed<br />\nCzechoslovakia, in trampled Austria,<br />\nthe thousands of Jews deprived of<br />\nnationality or persecuted in their<br />\nhome-land. For them the spirit of<br />\nChristmas will not be a reality. In<br />\nour own country, we are fighting for<br />\nthose rights which democracy and<br />\nfreedom give, and we are confident<br />\nthat America, which stands for these<br />\nideas, is our closest friend.

To<br />\nbegin with, the stigma which is attached to the element of compulsion<br />\nmakes our assembly scheme somewhat incompatible with certain of<br />\nHopkins' ideals. It is our conviction,<br />\nhowever, that regular, non-compulsory assemblies of a novel nature<br />\nwould be well attended by the student body. Of course the success of<br />\nthe non-compusory assembly plan<br />\nwould depend upon the initiative and<br />\nability of the group of persons designated to formulate the programs.<br />\nAnd this brings us to object. We<br />\npropose that:<br />\n1 the Student Council appoint a committee of two members from each<br />\nof the following groups; the A B<br />\nSchool, the Business School, the<br />\nEngineering School, the Teachers<br />\nCollege, and the Faculty. From<br />\neach of these groups except the latter, of course, one member is to<br />\nbe a lower classman; the other, an<br />\nupperclassman.<br />\n2 the committee arrange a schedule<br />\nof a weekly assembly programs<br />\ncomprised of talks, movies, musical<br />\npresentations, etc., the goal being<br />\nto get the best of available material.<br />\n3 the programs be planned far<br />\nenough in advance to permit of<br />\ntheir being adequately publicized.<br />\nWe feel that such a project, if<br />\nhandled correctly, would p ro v e<br />\nboon to the school and to the student body.

It doesn't seem<br />\ntoo easy to write formally and definitely about an association, which has been as intimate as has mine with<br /><br />\nThis is the<br />\nway the<br />\nworld ends<br /><br />\nthis paper.<br />\nI just haven't the stomach to draw up any bare<br />\n--statemzat of the highlights of my editorial career.<br />\nThere is in my memory only the vision of great fights<br />\nwhich were never fought and sacred duties which were<br />\nnever fulfilled.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, the things that have made the<br />\nlast four years with the NEWS-LETTER important to me<br />\nhaven't much to do with editorial pronouncements<br />\nanyway. They are bound up with a thousand hours of<br />\naimless, inexpert conversation whiCh still gives no prospect of ever coming to any conclusion. With eating<br />\nhot dogs at Al's Grill and lighting cigars at the blue<br />\nflame on the linotype. With some very drab crusades<br />\nand some very gaudy jokes. But, most of all, with the<br />\npeople I have known and the way they lived and<br />\nthought and talked.<br />\nFor the things I will miss are the things of the<br />\nspirit. As the world judges such matters this may or<br />\nmay not be a rather lousy paper. But, it is the only<br />\npaper I know where the staff could put off reading<br />\nproof to listen to the work of a new poet. Those who<br />\nwork on it may or may not be incompetents. But they<br />\nare young, and they are blessed with hope and a constitutional inability to say yes. The place in which I am<br />\nwriting now may or may not be as impressive as an<br />\nup-to-date newspaper plant would be. But I'll wager<br />\nthe air is a good bit cleaner.<br />\nThese are my people that I am leaving.'They have<br />\nshared their best thoughts and their last cigarettes<br />\nwith me. Such as it is, this is my testament to them.<br />\n\u2014Murray Keanpton<br />\nThe activity of Pi Delta Epsilon in the last few week's<br />\nhas had all the earmarks of<br />\nthe long-awaited, muchneeded rejuvenation of the<br />\ncampus journalistic honorary. The two projects with<br />\nwhich it is concerning itself\u2014the German refugee student committee, and the Baltimore high school newspaper contest\u2014are progressing apace. The activity<br />\nand interest of the membership evidences which is<br /><br />\nNotes<br />\non the<br />\nrebirth<br /><br />\nthis was, the group did nothing, despite repeated exhortations.<br />\nWe ask Pi D E once more to do that, which, of<br />\nall things possible in campus journalism at present is<br />\nmost within its precinct. The current renaissance of<br />\nthe fraternity can only if worthwhile if something<br />\nlasting is effected. The opportunity is present and<br />\nknocking.<br />\nIt's silly to belittle the work being carried on at<br />\npresent. Yet there is an absurd aspect to all this<br />\nfeverish activity being conducted along lines of general campus welfare, while direct problems are neglected.<br />\nThere is no question of the place for a magazine<br />\non the campus. But in the investigation of the feasibilty<br />\nand operation of such an undertaking -Pi D E must<br />\ndisplay the initiative.<br />\nWe don't suppose there's<br />\nany reason to get particularly charged up about our<br />\npoll on student government.<br />\nIt's really the Student council's affair.<br />\nBut, to any fair-minded person, the result looks pretty much like a kick in the<br />\nface for our representatives. The campus is in accord<br />\nwith every attempt to curb the powers of the council<br />\nand opposed to every attempt to extend them.<br />\nIn some ways this position is quite logical. There<br />\nis no conceivable reason why the council, as now<br />\nconstituted, should be given direct control over all<br />\nundergraduate activities. Certainly the record of the<br />\npast offers no basis for any confidence in its use of<br />\nsuch a power.<br />\nBut, imperfect instrument that it is, the council<br />\nis still the only 'organization representing the student<br />\nbody before the administration. As such, it is our only<br />\nhonest hope for the establishment of some measure of<br />\ndemocratic control.<br />\nThe proposed re-definition of powers is practical<br />\nonly when it is coupled with measures designed to turn<br />\nstudent government back to the campus. But, even<br />\nlimited .to its present functions, the Council cannot<br />\nescape the necessity of submitting to popular control.<br />\nThe boys have at hand one method of redeeming<br />\nthemselves in the eyes of at least the most articulate<br />\nsection of the campus. They can put into effect the<br />\nvarious controls suggested for their own special functions and thus rn-le possible the fullest participation<br />\nof the undergraduate body in their own affairs.<br />\nIf such a democratic Council should again come<br />\nforward to claim complete jurisdiction over college<br />\nactivities, it would have every right to expect the<br />\nsympathy of its constituents. For there would be no<br />\nbasis for the fears of those timid liberals who have<br />\nhitherto hesitated to support such demands.<br />\nIn orie respect at least, we yield to the Student<br />\ncouncil. There is a certain point beyond which we commence to be sick of sitting around and talking about<br />\ndemocracy. Evidentally, the council hasn't reached<br />\nthat point yet. If the boys are at all sincere, they had<br />\nbetter be getting there as soon as possible.<br /><br />\nLaps<br />\nof the<br />\nGods<br /><br />\nAbraham Lincoln was born<br />\non February 12th, George<br />\nWashington and the Johns<br />\nHopkins university on Feb.<br />\n22nd.

To<br />\nbegin with, the stigma which is attached to the element of compulsion<br />\nmakes our assembly scheme somewhat incompatible with certain of<br />\nHopkins' ideals. It is our conviction,<br />\nhowever, that regular, non-compulsory assemblies of a novel nature<br />\nwould be well attended by the student body. Of course the success of<br />\nthe non-compusory assembly plan<br />\nwould depend upon the initiative and<br />\nability of the group of persons designated to formulate the programs.<br />\nAnd this brings us to object. We<br />\npropose that:<br />\n1 the Student Council appoint a committee of two members from each<br />\nof the following groups; the A B<br />\nSchool, the Business School, the<br />\nEngineering School, the Teachers<br />\nCollege, and the Faculty. From<br />\neach of these groups except the latter, of course, one member is to<br />\nbe a lower classman; the other, an<br />\nupperclassman.<br />\n2 the committee arrange a schedule<br />\nof a weekly assembly programs<br />\ncomprised of talks, movies, musical<br />\npresentations, etc., the goal being<br />\nto get the best of available material.<br />\n3 the programs be planned far<br />\nenough in advance to permit of<br />\ntheir being adequately publicized.<br />\nWe feel that such a project, if<br />\nhandled correctly, would p ro v e<br />\nboon to the school and to the student body.
