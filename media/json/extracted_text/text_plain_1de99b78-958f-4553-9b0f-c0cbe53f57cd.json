For that<br />\nreason, he has called into consultation several of the alumni most<br />\nprominently connected with Hopkins' affairs, and wishes to consult with several more before his<br />\nfinal decision is announced.<br />\nThe committee which presented<br />\nthe petition to the president on<br />\nbehalf of the Omicron Delta Kappa consisted of John C. Knipp,<br />\npresident of the circle; Alexander<br />\nM.

It then requested that<br />\nthe president appoint a committee composed of undergraduates,<br />\ngraduates, faculty and alumni,<br />\nwhich should carefully consider<br />\nevery phase of athletics at Hopkins, and which should frame a<br />\npolicy to be followed consistently<br />\nin future years.<br />\nWhile no definite statement can<br />\nbe made at the present time, it is<br />\nextremely probable that the next<br />\nissue Of THE NEWS - LETTER will<br />\ncontain President Goodnow's announcement as to his decision<br />\nupon the petition. The president<br />\nrecently stated to a member of<br />\nthe Omicron Delta Kappa committee that he regretted that any<br />\ndelay was necessary, that he was<br />\nendeavoring to expedite matters<br />\nas much as possible and that he<br />\nexpected to come to a decision in<br />\nthe very near future.<br />\n<br />\nBy A. E. LINDLEY<br />\n<br />\nGeneral Secretary of the Y. M. C. A.<br />\n<br />\nThe recent campaign to raise<br />\nfunds for the men in the prison<br />\ncamps of Europe was highly successful. Although the entire $1,000, which we set as our goal, was<br />\nnot raised, we feel that it was a<br />\nsplendid showing for the Hopkins<br />\nmen. It has demonstrated that<br />\nthe Hopkins men are of the right<br />\ncalibre when a worthy cause is<br />\npresented to them. The Hopkins<br />\nmen responded to this call equally<br />\nas well as the men in any of the<br />\ncolleges and universities in this<br />\ncountry who have been waging<br />\ncampaigns for the same purpose.<br />\nSome of the institutions have<br />\ngiven larger amounts, but the<br />\naverage of Hopkins has been as<br />\ngreat. During this campaign,<br />\nmore money was given by students than at any previous time<br />\nin the history of the University.<br />\nWhile this movement was started by the Y. M. C. A. and was<br />\nlargely carried on by members of<br />\nthis organization, all felt that it<br />\nwas a movement in which all<br />\nstudents and members of the<br />\nfaculty could co operate. Men<br />\nwere brought face to face with the<br />\nconditions of our fellow-students<br />\nin Europe and felt a desire to<br />\nmake life a little bit easier for<br />\nthese men. Many students sacrificed in order that they might help<br />\nin forwarding this unselfish cause<br />\n\u2014a number of men giving up personal pleasures, thus enabling<br />\nthem to give to this fund.<br />\nThe actual work was done by<br />\nfour teams representing the student body. Fifty men in all were<br />\nactive in the campaign. All who<br />\ngave to this fund gave freely.<br />\nThey gave in 'order that they<br />\nmight share a little with our fellow-students on the other side.<br />\nWe can never know the full value<br />\nof this giving. It has eased many<br />\na pain and has given many a fellow a new hope for the future.<br />\nOn behalf of the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nand those men who were back of<br />\nthis movement, we wish to thank<br />\nall those who contributed, both<br />\nmembers of the faculty and students, either by giving of money<br />\nor time.

Nearly all of the books<br />\nare in their original bindings, and<br />\nmany of them contain interesting<br />\nbook plates,excellent frontispieces<br />\nand numerous wood cuts and engravings. An added interest in<br />\nmany of them consist in the autographs of the several men who have<br />\nin turn owned them. Most of the<br />\nbooks are in Latin, but several<br />\nare in German and English.<br />\nThere are several editions of Hippocrates, with the Greek and<br />\nLatin texts on opposite pages';<br />\nand there are also several copies<br />\n<br />\nof Celsus\u2014a book which has been<br />\nused in medical schools in Baltimore within rather recent times.<br />\nAmong the collection is a copy<br />\nof a quaint book of Culpepper's,<br />\ncalled \"The English Physician,\"<br />\ncontaining a \"compleat capital<br />\nMethod of Physick, whereby a<br />\nMan may preserve his Body in<br />\nHealth, or Cure himself, being<br />\nSick, for Three Pence Charge.\"<br />\nOne passage, in regard to plums,<br />\nremarks that \"all plums are under Venus and are like women,<br />\nsome better, some worse.\" Another is as follows: \"There is a<br />\nSyrup made of lore-hound to be<br />\nhad at the Apothecaries, very<br />\ngood for old Coughs, to rid the<br />\ntough Flegm as also to avoid<br />\ncold Rheums from the Lungs of<br />\nold Folks, and for those that are<br />\nAsthmatick or short winded.\"<br />\nThe paper on which most of<br />\nthese books are printed is marvelous when compared with the<br />\nflimsy paper of today, and the<br />\nprinting is still just as clear as it<br />\nwas three hundred years ago.

According to this estimate, \"regis-tration figures from more than<br />\nhalf a hundred American institutions of higher learning ten the<br />\nsame story of capacity enrollments.\"<br />\n\"To many institutions,\" the report continues, \"growing enrollments present a, serious problem.<br />\nWith present accommodations<br />\ntaxed to the limit, there Pare apparently only two courses open.<br />\nRegistration may be kept where<br />\nit is by a rigorous application of<br />\nthe 'first come, first served' principle, or ways and means for increasing accommodations must be<br />\ndevised.

The first is to the<br />\neffect that the proportion of high<br />\nschool boys entering the university is steadily growing. Private<br />\nSchool graduates are still in the<br />\n'majority, but their lead is a slender one. The inference is plain.<br />\nThe action taken by Harvard,<br />\nYale and Princeton to broaden<br />\ntheir entrance requirements has<br />\ndone just what the universities<br />\nhoped it would do. It has made<br />\nit possible for the average boy to<br />\nenter these three great endowed<br />\ninstitutions. Specialized training<br />\nfor admission examinations \u2014 a<br />\nservice which the small city or<br />\ntown high school cannot perform<br />\n\u2014is no longer essential. Intellectual ability, expressed in no<br />\nmatter what terms, is all that is<br />\nneeded. For the concessions involved in this new policy, the<br />\ncountry boy in particular is grateful. To him it means the opening<br />\nof new opportunities. But the universities are glad that they acted<br />\nas they did.<br />\n\"The other Princeton statement<br />\ndeclares that the scholarship of<br />\nthis year's freshman class is considerably higher than that of its<br />\npredecessor. The boys now entering the universitly are better prepa cd a wi consequently better fitted to carry on the work of the<br />\ncollege classroom. This should<br />\nbe an answer to those who feared<br />\nthat admission requirements had<br />\n<br />\nbeen lowered rather than broadened.<br />\n\"The Harvard - Yale- Princeton<br />\npolicy of basing admission on<br />\nquality rather than quantity of<br />\nscholarship has also been adopted<br />\nby four women's colleges \u2014 Mt.<br />\nHolyoke, Smith, Vassar and Wellesley. In 1919 the present<br />\nmethod of admission by certif.cate will be abandoned and in its<br />\nplace will be the so-called comprehensive examination p1 a n,<br />\nwhich depends on two kinds of<br />\nevidence\u2014the candidate's record<br />\nin the preparatory school and examinations in four major subjects. Discussing the change, the<br />\nofficial announcement from the<br />\nfour colleges says:<br />\n\"'It is believed that this new<br />\ntype of admission combines the<br />\nbest elements of the present certificate system and of the examination system in that it requires<br />\nthe school record and estimate of<br />\ncharacter, and also demands examinations designed to test the<br />\ncandidate's intellectual power,<br />\nnot alone her memory 'of prescribed facts. Furthermore, the<br />\nmethod offers the applicant the<br />\nfullest opportunity to show her<br />\nability in which she believes herself best qualified.<br />\n\"'This plan substitutes a: uniform method of administration in<br />\nplace of the various certificate<br />\nforms now .used by the four colleges and gives the school entire<br />\nfreedom in the sequence of its<br />\nwork, making no requirement of<br />\ncertain subjects in the last years.'<br />\n\"Returning to registration figures, it appears that in the number of actual students pursuing<br />\ndefinite courses, New York University now leads the country.<br />\nThis was an honor that was supposedly Columbia's. But Columbia's numerical strength lies<br />\nlargely in its summer school and<br />\nextension courses. The statistics<br />\nalso show that a good many universities boast enrollments exceeding five thousand and indicate to what an extent higher education has become popularized.<br />\nIt is difficult to estimate, of<br />\ncourse, how many thousands of<br />\nAmericans of all ages are within<br />\nthe circle of influence of the university, but extension courses are<br />\nflourishing everywhere\u2014the United States mail carries learning<br />\nto the remotest points and summer sessions were never so popular.

The big universities of the<br />\ncountry, all of them having a registration exceeding five thousand,<br />\nin alphabetical order, are: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Northwestern, Ohio State<br />\nand the Universities of California, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

The open game, so<br />\nnecessary for a successful modern<br />\nattack, gives a splendid opportunity of following the advance<br />\nof the ball. Football has developed into a game in which forward passing and kicking predominate, and it is this sort of<br />\nspectacle that football enthusiasts like, rather than the old<br />\nrushing game, with its close,<br />\nmass-play formations.<br />\n\"The season was unusual, inasmuch as the end of the football<br />\nyear found an entirely new class<br />\nof elevens at the top of the ranking.

Although the entire $1,000, which we set as our goal, was<br />\nnot raised, we feel that it was a<br />\nsplendid showing for the Hopkins<br />\nmen. It has demonstrated that<br />\nthe Hopkins men are of the right<br />\ncalibre when a worthy cause is<br />\npresented to them. The Hopkins<br />\nmen responded to this call equally<br />\nas well as the men in any of the<br />\ncolleges and universities in this<br />\ncountry who have been waging<br />\ncampaigns for the same purpose.<br />\nSome of the institutions have<br />\ngiven larger amounts, but the<br />\naverage of Hopkins has been as<br />\ngreat. During this campaign,<br />\nmore money was given by students than at any previous time<br />\nin the history of the University.<br />\nWhile this movement was started by the Y. M. C. A. and was<br />\nlargely carried on by members of<br />\nthis organization, all felt that it<br />\nwas a movement in which all<br />\nstudents and members of the<br />\nfaculty could co operate. Men<br />\nwere brought face to face with the<br />\nconditions of our fellow-students<br />\nin Europe and felt a desire to<br />\nmake life a little bit easier for<br />\nthese men. Many students sacrificed in order that they might help<br />\nin forwarding this unselfish cause<br />\n\u2014a number of men giving up personal pleasures, thus enabling<br />\nthem to give to this fund.<br />\nThe actual work was done by<br />\nfour teams representing the student body. Fifty men in all were<br />\nactive in the campaign. All who<br />\ngave to this fund gave freely.<br />\nThey gave in 'order that they<br />\nmight share a little with our fellow-students on the other side.<br />\nWe can never know the full value<br />\nof this giving. It has eased many<br />\na pain and has given many a fellow a new hope for the future.<br />\nOn behalf of the Y. M. C.

According to this estimate, \"regis-tration figures from more than<br />\nhalf a hundred American institutions of higher learning ten the<br />\nsame story of capacity enrollments.\"<br />\n\"To many institutions,\" the report continues, \"growing enrollments present a, serious problem.<br />\nWith present accommodations<br />\ntaxed to the limit, there Pare apparently only two courses open.<br />\nRegistration may be kept where<br />\nit is by a rigorous application of<br />\nthe 'first come, first served' principle, or ways and means for increasing accommodations must be<br />\ndevised.

The first is to the<br />\neffect that the proportion of high<br />\nschool boys entering the university is steadily growing. Private<br />\nSchool graduates are still in the<br />\n'majority, but their lead is a slender one. The inference is plain.<br />\nThe action taken by Harvard,<br />\nYale and Princeton to broaden<br />\ntheir entrance requirements has<br />\ndone just what the universities<br />\nhoped it would do. It has made<br />\nit possible for the average boy to<br />\nenter these three great endowed<br />\ninstitutions. Specialized training<br />\nfor admission examinations \u2014 a<br />\nservice which the small city or<br />\ntown high school cannot perform<br />\n\u2014is no longer essential. Intellectual ability, expressed in no<br />\nmatter what terms, is all that is<br />\nneeded. For the concessions involved in this new policy, the<br />\ncountry boy in particular is grateful. To him it means the opening<br />\nof new opportunities. But the universities are glad that they acted<br />\nas they did.<br />\n\"The other Princeton statement<br />\ndeclares that the scholarship of<br />\nthis year's freshman class is considerably higher than that of its<br />\npredecessor. The boys now entering the universitly are better prepa cd a wi consequently better fitted to carry on the work of the<br />\ncollege classroom. This should<br />\nbe an answer to those who feared<br />\nthat admission requirements had<br /><br />\nbeen lowered rather than broadened.<br />\n\"The Harvard - Yale- Princeton<br />\npolicy of basing admission on<br />\nquality rather than quantity of<br />\nscholarship has also been adopted<br />\nby four women's colleges \u2014 Mt.<br />\nHolyoke, Smith, Vassar and Wellesley. In 1919 the present<br />\nmethod of admission by certif.cate will be abandoned and in its<br />\nplace will be the so-called comprehensive examination p1 a n,<br />\nwhich depends on two kinds of<br />\nevidence\u2014the candidate's record<br />\nin the preparatory school and examinations in four major subjects. Discussing the change, the<br />\nofficial announcement from the<br />\nfour colleges says:<br />\n\"'It is believed that this new<br />\ntype of admission combines the<br />\nbest elements of the present certificate system and of the examination system in that it requires<br />\nthe school record and estimate of<br />\ncharacter, and also demands examinations designed to test the<br />\ncandidate's intellectual power,<br />\nnot alone her memory 'of prescribed facts. Furthermore, the<br />\nmethod offers the applicant the<br />\nfullest opportunity to show her<br />\nability in which she believes herself best qualified.<br />\n\"'This plan substitutes a: uniform method of administration in<br />\nplace of the various certificate<br />\nforms now .used by the four colleges and gives the school entire<br />\nfreedom in the sequence of its<br />\nwork, making no requirement of<br />\ncertain subjects in the last years.'<br />\n\"Returning to registration figures, it appears that in the number of actual students pursuing<br />\ndefinite courses, New York University now leads the country.<br />\nThis was an honor that was supposedly Columbia's.

The statistics of experts during the last season reveal a tremendous growth in the<br />\nsport.
