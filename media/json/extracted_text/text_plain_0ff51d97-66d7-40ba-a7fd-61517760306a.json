It was not written as a biography<br />\nbut rather as an object lesson from<br />\nthe man who wrote it to his young<br />\nnephew, Wm.

It especially commends<br />\nhis valor in battle, holding him up<br />\nas a paragon of virtue and courage.<br />\nAlthough they wish to make this<br />\nvaluable literature public, neither Dr.<br />\nHudson nor his associate are yet satisfied with the Latin translation they<br />\nhave made.

Their line<br />\nplay around the center was practically<br />\nair-tight, but the visting team elected<br />\nto direct its attack around the ends.<br />\nHowever, it took a system of tricky<br />\nlaterals, and some well-nigh perfect<br />\nblocking to make this offensive successful.<br />\nThe Virginians' scoring was concentrated in the third and early fourth<br />\nquarters. \"Baby\" Bair's 65-yard demonstration of broken - field running<br />\nwas the outstanding event of the<br />\nafternoon. Paliscak, who scored three<br />\ntouchdowns, was the visiting team's<br />\nstar.<br />\nGraziano Scores<br />\nHopkins' only score came underway in the fourth period with Kahl<br />\nand Graziano doing all of the balltoting. Graziano veritably hurled himself across from the 1-yard line.<br />\nRandolph-Macon lost no time in<br />\ntaking the opening Hopkins' kick-off<br />\nand driving the Jays back to their own<br />\ngoal line. In the shadow of their<br />\ngoal posts, the Blue team tightened<br />\nits defense and held for downs. Again<br />\nthe Yellow-Jackets plowed ahead only<br />\nto be denied once more by inspired<br />\nresistance on the part of the Jays'<br />\nforward wall.<br />\nRandolph-Macon Tallies<br />\nBut when the Jays kicked out of<br />\ndanger, a lateraled runback set the<br />\nstage for the first tally for RandolphMacon. A sustained running and<br />\npassing attack earned the Jackets<br />\ntheir first six points. Poliscak hitting<br />\nthe line for the score. The placement<br />\nwas wide. The remainder of the first<br />\nquarter saw the Blue Jays fighting<br />\nhard to push over a touchdown and<br />\nbeing checked by an unpenetrable<br />\nvisiting line.<br />\nThe second period brought renewed hopes to the home-team rooters.<br />\nAfter dominating the play for a short<br />\nwhile, the Virginians were forced to<br />\nkick, the ball bouncing over the Hopkins goal line for a touchback. Taking<br />\nthe ball on their own 20-yard line,<br />\nthe Jays moved fifty yards in a sustained drive, with Graziano and Kahl<br />\ncarrying the ball off tackle and around<br />\nthe ends. The Blue line opened up<br />\nlarge holes for the backs to charge<br />\nthrough. But Randolph-Macon finally held for downs on their own 30yard line. The half ended with the<br />\nYellow Jackets in possession of the<br />\nball at midfield.<br />\nJay Strategy Fails<br />\nThe second half was all RandolphMacon. To start things, instead of<br />\npunting on fourth down while on<br />\ntheir own 30-yard line, Hopkins chose<br />\nto run the ball in an attempt to gain<br />\na first down. This strategy failed,<br />\nand the visitors tok the ball on their<br />\nopponent's 30. From here the YellowJackets pushed to a first-down on the<br />\n20-yard marker, from which point<br />\nPaliscak again crossed the goal line.<br />\nThe placement this time was good,<br />\nand the score stood at 13-0.<br />\nRandolph-Macon kickied off and<br />\nfor a while it looked as if the hometeam were marching to a touchdown.<br />\nBut once again the visitors tightened.<br />\nBair and Paliscak combined their<br />\nrunning skill to add six more ponts<br />\nto their team's total. Paliscak again<br />\nbucked the line for the tally. The<br />\nconversion attempt failed. The score<br />\nstood 19-0.<br />\nEarly in the last stanza, Greer<br />\npunted from deep in his own territory<br />\nto the Randolph-Macon 35-yard line.<br />\nBair caught the ball and ran 65 yards<br />\n<br />\nSport Schedule<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE<br />\nCross Country\u2014Friday, November<br />\n6, Hopkins vs. Drexel, away.<br />\nFootball\u2014Saturday, November 7,<br />\nHopkins vs. Swarthmore, away.<br />\nSoccer \u2014 Saturday, November 7,<br />\nHopkins vs. Maryland, pending.<br />\nINTERFRATERNITY<br />\nTuesday, November 3, Phi Sigma<br />\nDelta vs. Kappa Alpha, Field 2.<br />\n\u2014Phi Epsilon Pi vs. Delta Upsilon, Field 1.<br />\nWednesday, November 4\u2014Alpha<br />\nvs. Alpha Delta Phi, Field 1.<br />\n\u2014Kappa Sigma vs. Omicron<br />\nKappa Omicron, Field 2.<br />\nThursday, November 5\u2014Pi Lambda Phi vs. Tau Alpha Phi,<br />\nField 2<br />\n\u2014Tau Alpha Omega vs. Beta<br />\nTheta Pi, Field 1.<br />\nFriday, November 6\u2014Alpha Epsilon Pi vs. Phi Psi, Field 1.<br />\n\u2014Delta Phi vs. Sigma Phi Epsilon, Field 2.<br />\n<br />\nJohnnies Bag<br />\nFourth In Row<br />\n<br />\nThe Blue Jay booters battled the<br />\nTowson Teachers to a scoreless tie<br />\nat Homewood last Friday.<br />\nHopkins came close to a victory<br />\nwhen Bill Gough, playing right half<br />\nfor the Jays, drew a penalty kick after<br />\na foul by Towson. His boot struck<br />\nGoalie Hamilton and the ball bounded back into the playing field. Gough<br />\nfollowed up with another boot which<br />\nwent into the goal.

A sustained running and<br />\npassing attack earned the Jackets<br />\ntheir first six points. Poliscak hitting<br />\nthe line for the score. The placement<br />\nwas wide. The remainder of the first<br />\nquarter saw the Blue Jays fighting<br />\nhard to push over a touchdown and<br />\nbeing checked by an unpenetrable<br />\nvisiting line.<br />\nThe second period brought renewed hopes to the home-team rooters.<br />\nAfter dominating the play for a short<br />\nwhile, the Virginians were forced to<br />\nkick, the ball bouncing over the Hopkins goal line for a touchback. Taking<br />\nthe ball on their own 20-yard line,<br />\nthe Jays moved fifty yards in a sustained drive, with Graziano and Kahl<br />\ncarrying the ball off tackle and around<br />\nthe ends. The Blue line opened up<br />\nlarge holes for the backs to charge<br />\nthrough. But Randolph-Macon finally held for downs on their own 30yard line. The half ended with the<br />\nYellow Jackets in possession of the<br />\nball at midfield.<br />\nJay Strategy Fails<br />\nThe second half was all RandolphMacon. To start things, instead of<br />\npunting on fourth down while on<br />\ntheir own 30-yard line, Hopkins chose<br />\nto run the ball in an attempt to gain<br />\na first down. This strategy failed,<br />\nand the visitors tok the ball on their<br />\nopponent's 30. From here the YellowJackets pushed to a first-down on the<br />\n20-yard marker, from which point<br />\nPaliscak again crossed the goal line.<br />\nThe placement this time was good,<br />\nand the score stood at 13-0.<br />\nRandolph-Macon kickied off and<br />\nfor a while it looked as if the hometeam were marching to a touchdown.<br />\nBut once again the visitors tightened.<br />\nBair and Paliscak combined their<br />\nrunning skill to add six more ponts<br />\nto their team's total. Paliscak again<br />\nbucked the line for the tally. The<br />\nconversion attempt failed. The score<br />\nstood 19-0.<br />\nEarly in the last stanza, Greer<br />\npunted from deep in his own territory<br />\nto the Randolph-Macon 35-yard line.<br />\nBair caught the ball and ran 65 yards<br /><br />\nSport Schedule<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE<br />\nCross Country\u2014Friday, November<br />\n6, Hopkins vs. Drexel, away.<br />\nFootball\u2014Saturday, November 7,<br />\nHopkins vs. Swarthmore, away.<br />\nSoccer \u2014 Saturday, November 7,<br />\nHopkins vs. Maryland, pending.<br />\nINTERFRATERNITY<br />\nTuesday, November 3, Phi Sigma<br />\nDelta vs. Kappa Alpha, Field 2.<br />\n\u2014Phi Epsilon Pi vs. Delta Upsilon, Field 1.<br />\nWednesday, November 4\u2014Alpha<br />\nvs. Alpha Delta Phi, Field 1.<br />\n\u2014Kappa Sigma vs. Omicron<br />\nKappa Omicron, Field 2.<br />\nThursday, November 5\u2014Pi Lambda Phi vs. Tau Alpha Phi,<br />\nField 2<br />\n\u2014Tau Alpha Omega vs. Beta<br />\nTheta Pi, Field 1.<br />\nFriday, November 6\u2014Alpha Epsilon Pi vs. Phi Psi, Field 1.<br />\n\u2014Delta Phi vs. Sigma Phi Epsilon, Field 2.<br /><br />\nJohnnies Bag<br />\nFourth In Row<br /><br />\nThe Blue Jay booters battled the<br />\nTowson Teachers to a scoreless tie<br />\nat Homewood last Friday.<br />\nHopkins came close to a victory<br />\nwhen Bill Gough, playing right half<br />\nfor the Jays, drew a penalty kick after<br />\na foul by Towson. His boot struck<br />\nGoalie Hamilton and the ball bounded back into the playing field. Gough<br />\nfollowed up with another boot which<br />\nwent into the goal.
