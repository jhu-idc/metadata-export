A proposal has<br />\nevolved out of their discussions<br />\nthat the center, since it is to be<br />\nfor the benefit of students, be<br />\ndesigned and built entirely by<br />\nstudents on a site and with funds<br />\nprovided by the administration.<br />\nThe conceivers of this plan,<br />\nMann and Student Council President John Guess, suggested it as<br />\nan alternative to a \"package\"<br />\nprovided by the administration.<br />\nOne committee member praised<br />\nGuess and Mann's proposal because he said it would insure a<br />\nstudent-oriented<br />\nrealistically<br />\ncenter.

Mowbray, a<br />\nHopkins senior, died in an automobile accident on the J.F.K.<br />\nMemorial Highway near Whitemarsh.<br />\nJohn was an active member of<br />\nKappa Alpha Order.

The<br />\nreason for the failure, its chief<br />\nplanners maintain, was faculty<br />\nand student apathy.<br />\n\"Nobody cares,\" said Dr.John<br />\nMann of the Education Department, who served on the Committee. \"If it takes a large drive<br />\nto get signatures, well, then,fuck<br />\nit''<br />\nBob Cotter, head of the Graduate Student Organization, blamed<br />\nthe fact that \"... a lot of graduate students weren't interested.<br />\n<br />\nThe Discipline Code was aimed<br />\nat undergraduates. Some thought<br />\nthat the SAC alternative wasn't<br />\nm nen better than the Administration's plan. In fact, rules that<br />\nwere common to both plans were<br />\nused to convict the Book Store<br />\nthief.;;<br />\n<br />\nNo Big Issue<br />\nSA Organizer Jim Cleary commented, \"The students did not<br />\nthink it was a big issue. But with<br />\nthe Book Store theft, it is a big<br />\nissue. We had student support,<br />\nbut not strong. It was mainly an<br />\ninterested minority.\"<br />\nThe petitioners raised serious<br />\ndoubts abouttlieforthcomingeffectiveness of the Code. Cotter explained, \"Individual cases will<br />\ncome up and when they go wrong<br />\nthey will have to be opposed.The<br />\ntendency is going to be to ignore<br />\n<br />\nSUNDAY, April 12th<br />\n<br />\n, the Code. It gives legitimacy to<br />\nthe Administration's arbitrariness. It is regressive.\"<br />\nAlso tied up in the controversy<br />\nis the governance issue.\"Whether or not the jdiscipline code<br />\nwill work,\" said Dr. Mann, \"depends on if the University supplies a context of a rational governmental system. The Code<br />\nstuck in the middle of the present<br />\nsystem will not work. Our draft<br />\nwould not work by itself butwould<br />\npoint the way toward changes in<br />\nthe governmental system.\"<br />\nFinally, there is rejection of<br />\nany overall Administration imposition of a Discipline Code.<br />\nCotter said, \"I don't see why<br />\nthe Student Council can't write<br />\na Code.

It's ironic. The Dean Rusk's and McGeorge Bundy's<br />\nof two years ago were right when they pointed to the<br />\n\"danger\" of American withdrawal\u2014the domino theory.<br />\nThey were right, but they had the wrong villain.

Although most \"true radicals\" frown<br />\non the Moratorium, it has proven effective in organizing\u2014<br />\nOver-organizing, some say\u2014large groups of diverse people<br />\nfor mass political action.

The courts have thus far steadfastly ignored attempts<br />\nto test the Constitutionolity of the Massachusetts law.<br />\nIncreasingly, politicians have been forced to acknowledge<br />\nthe existence of the unacceptable. Maybe next year the<br />\ntrend will spread to editors and jurists.<br />\n<br />\nFor Abortion<br />\nGovernor Mandel's hesitation at reaching a decision<br />\non the socially vital abortion bill repeal is attributable to<br />\nhis future political aspirations and pressure from the<br />\npowerful Catholic church in Maryland.<br />\nThe Governor has claimed he is opposed to two parts<br />\nlegislation which would give Maryland the most<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nliberal abortion law in the nation. First, that the law.<br />\nwould allow individuals from out of state to come to<br />\nMaryland for an abortion. Maryland citizenship is not<br />\n\u2022 required for any other operation and there is no reason<br />\nfor such a prerequisite for abortions.<br />\nSecond, that the father of an unborn child is not required to grant permission for the operation. If the<br />\nparents of the child are unable to independently reach<br />\nan agreement of such proportions then it is dubious as to<br />\nwhether a child should be born into the family at all.<br />\nMandel is apparently waiting to see if R. Sargent<br />\nShriver will seek the governorship of Maryland before<br />\nmaking a decision on the abortion bill. By vetoing the<br />\nrepeal Mandel would gain strong support from the Catholic church in what could be a close fight for the Democratic<br />\nnomination against the former ambassador to France.<br />\nBasing a decision of such great social importance on<br />\npolitical aspirations is unfortunate with the population<br />\nrising at a tremendous rate and illegitimacy remaining<br />\na major problem.<br />\n<br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nEver been to a circus? Of course you have.<br />\nEveryone has. But a few weekends ago I went to a<br />\ndifferent kind of circus - no spangled trapeze girls,<br />\nno tigers and white horses.The only things similar<br />\nto - Barnum's spectacle were the three rings and<br />\nthe plethora of clowns.<br />\nThe circus I attended was officially titled the<br />\nNational Conference on Political Justice, though<br />\nthe National Exhibition of Leftist Political Turmoil<br />\nwould have been more appropriate. It was probably the same as any such gathering -- they all<br />\nreveal the conflicts, disputes and insecurities of<br />\nthe left.<br />\nIn the center ring of this political circus was a<br />\npanel of four. William Kunstler, defender of H.<br />\nRap Brown and the Chicago 7, was the star attraction. Melvin Wulf, Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union, was there. And two<br />\nunknowns: Jerry Mandel, professor of sociology at<br />\nSonoma State University, and Robert Mozenter,<br />\nPhiladelphia Assistant District Attorney for narcotics and rackets (the conference was held at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.) Mozenter was the<br />\ntoken conservative, to \"balance\" the panel. Halfway through the festivities Charles Garry made a<br />\nsurprise appearance. Garry, national lawyer for<br />\nthe Black Panther Party, is presently defending<br />\nBobby Seale on a New Haven murder charge.<br />\n<br />\nIn The Road<br />\nStar attraction Kunstler opened the show. First<br />\nhe read part of Jerry Rubin's book \"Dolt!\", then<br />\nproceeded to proclaim Rubin's seriousness,while<br />\nthrowing out jokes about Julius Hoffman.If Kunstler did say anything about American problems it<br />\nwas so simplistic and obvious as to be pathetically<br />\nmeaningless - \"Chicago cops and Southern sheriffs<br />\npick on long-hairs and blacks\", etc. Very disappointing.<br />\nThen Melvin Wulf spoke, addressing the crowd<br />\nof over one thousand in a voice so flat and pedantic<br />\nthat everyone was soon asleep. As his speechwas<br />\ndistinguished by a total lack of anything memorable, I have forgotten what he said.<br />\nLong-haired pseudo-freak Jerry Mandel was<br />\nnext, putting down Philadelphia and telling inexcusable jokes. A few days before, immediately<br />\nafter his arrival, Mandel's two traveling companions were busted for possession, and he had<br />\nspent the time between then and the Conference<br />\ntripping, staring out of his hotelwindow for police.<br />\nHe was the third strike - the Conference was uninformative and boring, even a failure as a circus.<br />\nAt this point, with the words of closing speaker<br />\nMozenter, the spotlight shifted to the other two<br />\nrings of the circus, the audience. The rest of the<br />\nshow was amusing, chaotic, disturbing, tragic.<br />\n<br />\nDoing His Job<br />\nPhiladelphia's chief narc, Mozenter began by<br />\ndescribing how unfair the drug laws are, which<br />\nis like trying to convince the Ecumenical Council<br />\nthat God exists.(He has since resigned in protest<br />\nof harsh penalties for drug violators.) Random<br />\nheckling bothered him, he paused. \"Look, I'm a<br />\nyoung fellow myself and I'm just doing my job.\"<br />\nYou didn't really say that, did you? Too late now.<br />\nThe crowd's reaction to Mozenter's unfortunate<br />\nchoice of words need not be described. After the<br />\nnoise subsided the audience realized that they<br />\nhad just done and could do,that the panel was boring and their own shouts and jeers were more<br />\nentertaining. It was like a rock concert, where<br />\nthe people in the seats are often more fascinating than the people on stage.<br />\nAs expected, the auditorium was filled with<br />\nan almost all-white under-25 crowd, mostly Penn<br />\nstudents. Because of this about twenty Panthers<br />\nshowed up. Specializing in high-pressure salesmanship and the production of an awful newspaper,<br />\n<br />\nthe Panthers strenuously endeavored to collect<br />\nmoney. Throughout the carnival a female Panther<br />\nat the back would loudly shout \"right on!\" whenever anyone cheered, that is, about every thirty<br />\nseconds.<br />\n<br />\nTwo More Rings<br />\nAfter Mozenter had declared his Eichmannesque<br />\ndevotion to duty the main topic of discussion became whether he should be allowed to continue<br />\nhis speech. This split the crowd circus into its<br />\ntwo rings - on one side the liberals in favor of<br />\nparliamentary courtesy and FirstAmendmentprotection for all, on the other side the radicals fed<br />\nup with the bullshit.<br />\nYes, it's in the Constitution - free speech for<br />\nall. But if the Constitution means nothingto Julius<br />\nHoffman, John Murtagh, John Mitchell, Harrold<br />\nCarswell, et al., how can it mean anythingto people who know how unjust the laws can be?<br />\nTrue, it's a courtesy liberals pride themselves<br />\non - letting the opposition speak. But this little<br />\nnicety is plainly hypocritical, as no self-respecting liberal listens to what the opposition says anyway. And the time has come to stop being courteous<br />\nwith cops, narcs, and their political bosses. How<br />\nmuch courtesy has Ronald Reagon shown toward<br />\nCalifornia students? How courteous was Richard<br />\nDaley in August, 1968? (you DO remember, don't<br />\nyou?) How much longer will masochistic white<br />\nliberals continue to hold worthless meetings while<br />\npeople are sent to prison? Ask Fred Hampton about<br />\ncourtesy, he'll tell you.<br />\n<br />\nInside or Out<br />\nFurther babbling from the stage cleaved the<br />\ngathering even more into liberals vs. radicals.<br />\nThe issue became the abstract question of whether<br />\npolitical and social change should be implemented<br />\nby working within the established system or outside of that system. An extremely crucial question. No talk about the changes,just about how they<br />\nshould be accomplished. Wulf insisted that the<br />\nbattles had to be won in court. Finally allowed to<br />\nspeak (i.e. ignored), Mozenter advocated the election of the right representatives to legislatures,<br />\nadvocated with such urgent freqency that I began<br />\nto wait for his announcement of candidacy. Kunstler was magnificently ambivalent on this point.<br />\nCharles Garry's views regardingthis topicwere<br />\nmost interesting. In emotional and colorful language he expressed his disgust and frustration after<br />\nmany years of facing the Julius Hoffmans of<br />\nAmerica. He's seen the system liberals want to<br />\nwork within.He knows what an intolerably long<br />\ntime change takes,that reforms are often corrupted or diluted, that progress may just as likely be<br />\nbackward as forward. There is no need to mention<br />\nexamples of this.<br />\n<br />\nBurn and Build<br />\nTo paraphrase, Garry's message was this: burn<br />\nand build. And you can't accomplish the building<br />\nwithout doing the burning first.<br />\nLiberals in the crowd considered Garry a<br />\ndemagogue and resented his unannounced appearance. Radicals cheered and whistled, their most<br />\nrevolutionary actions to date. Liberals, I suggest,<br />\nshould see \"Z\" and think carefully about what<br />\nhappened to the Greek pacifists who tried to work<br />\nby the established rules. Ask GregOrios Lambrakis<br />\nabout courtesy, he'll tell you.<br />\nWill all of those who agree that change is<br />\nnecessary ever concur on the methods to achieve<br />\nthose changes? The circus convinced me that while<br />\nthat day is coming closer it's still along way off.<br />\nClinging to noble principles, idealists and liberals<br />\nshudder at the thought of revolutionary tactics. But<br />\nfew of them have discovered how difficult it is to<br />\nrationally discuss politics with a man swinging a<br />\nclub.<br />\nIt was just another circus, perhaps. Not the greatest show on earth, but one of the saddest.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nI RETURNS<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nIn these times of crisis on campuses across<br />\nthe nation I find it difficult to believe that the<br />\nStudent Council at Hopkins has maintained it<br />\nstatus as a lackadaisical body.

Everyday, I would rush to my New York<br />\nTimes to exclaim over the latest judicial outrage.<br />\nFrom shackling Bobby<br />\nSeale to refusing to let Ramsey Clark<br />\ntestify, Judge Julius Hoffman handily<br />\nprovided me with continuing proof of<br />\nAmerican repression. In a long tradition of heavy - handed autocrats, he<br />\nenabled me to keep my stereotypes<br />\nintact. Along with John Mitchell and<br />\nRonald Reagan, he is a radical's best<br />\nfriend.<br />\nAnd now there is a book out on the<br />\ntrial, The Tales of Hoffman (Bantam,<br />\n$1.50). It's not really a book at all,<br />\nbut the edited transcripts of the trial,<br />\nSO we are able to see the full progression of events that was so poorly<br />\nreported by the daily press. The book<br />\nis, quite simply, great reading, because it provides all the thrilling elements of courtroom dramas. Including eloquent defense summations and<br />\n<br />\nsort of outrages, the defendants began<br />\nto act like the humans they are. Can<br />\nanyone of us say that he wouldn't have<br />\nshouted out when Seale was gagged?<br />\nFar removed from the horror of this<br />\ntrial, we are angry. Imagine how we<br />\nwould react in the courtroom itself.<br />\nThe transcripts, rather than the Times,<br />\naccurately relate what happened.<br />\nThe Times, as the paper of record,<br />\nis what we are supposed to rely on.<br />\nBut thanks to a w.eekly, The Village<br />\nVoice, we know what actually happened<br />\nto the coverage of the trial.<br />\nThe Times sent its Pulitzer prizewinning young reporter, J. Anthony Lukas to the trial. He had understood<br />\nthat he would be given leeway to write<br />\nlong pieces, and that the trial would be<br />\n<br />\nBy GEORGE KLOPFER<br />\nLike Gunter Grass, Anthony Burgess<br />\nis a highly talented and original writer<br />\nwho has been on the scene for a while,<br />\nbut is only beginning to gain widespread<br />\nrecognition. \"Clockwork Orange,\" his<br />\nmost famous novel, first published in<br />\n1962, started out slowly, but has gained<br />\nsteadily in popularity ever since. Recently, Stanley (2001) Kubrick announced his plans to make a movie out of it,<br />\nand a dynamite movie it should be at<br />\nthat.<br />\nOr a \"horrowshow\" movie, if you<br />\nwant to put it into Burgess's terms.<br />\nYou see, Burgess invented a whole<br />\nyouth argot for his book.<br />\n<br />\nTHe MACKICAN P1OP1,6 ARE<br />\nMRCP OF VIEMN-4<br />\n<br />\nTHE\" AMERICAN PEOP1G AREFEV up tom civti, foGrirs.<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nwould not print a 1,000-word news analysis Lukas submitted.<br />\nThe Times capped its meager coverage of the trial with an editorial prais-<br />\n<br />\ning the verdict as a vindication of<br />\nAmerican justice. Since the jury let<br />\nWeiner and Froines go, and dropped<br />\nthe conspiracy part of the charges, the<br />\nTimes felt that this was ample proof<br />\nof the basic soundness of the court<br />\nsystem. Actually, after being cooped<br />\nup for more than four months in hotel<br />\nrooms, the jury was split; four for a<br />\ntotal acquittal, and eight for convicting everybody. So, they arrived at a<br />\ncompromise, with the more famous defendants being convicted of inciting to<br />\nriot on the basis of their speeches<br />\nThis is not, in my mind, a<br />\nalone.<br />\nsterling example of justice.<br />\nBut the real truth of the trial lies<br />\nin the transcripts, and they are both<br />\ndisturbing and captivating and they must<br />\nbe read.<br />\n<br />\nOrange Burgess Clock:<br />\nStarry but Horrorshow<br />\n<br />\nvicious prosecutors.<br />\nThere has not been enough attention<br />\ngiven to what the trial actually means.<br />\nThe liberal press, most glaringly the<br />\nNew York Times, portrayed the trial<br />\nas some sort of circus, with both sides<br />\nsharing the guilt. Not surprisingly,<br />\nthis is also how the Times handled<br />\nthe police riots in Chicago. The Times,<br />\nas usual, blamed extremists on both<br />\nsides, and, of course, appealed for<br />\nmoderation.<br />\nIn the Conspiracy Trial, the Times<br />\ngot in its swipes at the defendants who<br />\nwere supposedly trying to make a shambles of the judicial system. That is<br />\nnonsense, as a reading of the transcript will show. With Seale, for example, his demands for the right to<br />\nself-defense in the absence of his lawyer Charles Garry were initially quite<br />\npolite and reasonable. It is only after<br />\nsystematic refusals by Hoffman to grant<br />\nthis undeniable constitutional right that<br />\nSeale begins losing his temper. It is<br />\nonly then that he begins to use ghetto<br />\nslang, other than the windy phrases the<br />\nTimes finds so appealing.<br />\nThe \"outburst\" and \"tantrums\" that<br />\nthe liberal press found upsetting were<br />\nactually nothing more than human reactions to a rigged, oppressive trial.<br />\nAfter weeks and weeks of seeing all<br />\n<br />\ngiven prominent coverage.<br />\nThat is not what happened at all.<br />\nLukas' dispatches were severly chopped up, and they were usually buried in<br />\nthe middle of the paper. Furthermore,<br />\nthe copy editors made subtle shifts, so<br />\nthat when Lukas would write \"Judge<br />\nHoffman shouted . . .,\" they would<br />\nchange it to \"said,\" while reserving<br />\nnuance-filled words like \"shouted\" for<br />\nthe defendants. Lukas complained to a<br />\nNewsweek reporter, \"I wish I had the<br />\nfreedom of Nicholas Von Hoffman of<br />\nthe Washington Post.\" And the Times<br />\n<br />\nRussian Slang, 1984?<br />\n\"Clockwork Orange\" is narrated by<br />\nAlex, the 15-year-old leader of a street<br />\ngang in some future iron-gray superstate.

Benzon describes<br />\nthe disastrous Hopkins career of<br />\nan acquaintance he names Larry,<br />\na career that included stealing<br />\nfrom the Bookstore for resale,<br />\nheavy drug involvement, and various projects of a similar sort.<br />\nI first assumed Benzon was being<br />\nironic when he attributed major<br />\nresponsibility for Larry's troubles to the University (and apparently in particular, to its twoweek suspension of Larry for<br />\nBookstore stealing). But then I<br />\ndecided he was in earnest. What<br />\nstruck me most about the piece<br />\nwas Benzon's apparent assumption that none of this was really<br />\nLarry's fault, that he could not<br />\nbe held responsible for his<br />\nactions, because he was being<br />\nterribly oppressed, by the University and others. Such a philosophy may be temporarily soothing, but it does a disservice to<br />\none who holds it. It lulls him into<br />\na false sense that he can be sheltered from the consequences of<br />\nhis actions, when in the long run,<br />\nit is he and only he who must live<br />\nwith those consequences.<br />\nI believe, as Benzon does, that<br />\nthe approrpriate environment<br />\nfor Larry was probably a close<br />\ncommunity which would both support and constrain him, to which<br />\nhe was bound by mutual obliga-<br />\n<br />\ntion. But universities are not, and<br />\nhave never been, such communities. They are lonelier places,<br />\npsychologically unsuitable for<br />\nmany, and tension-inducing at<br />\nbest. Reforms in university<br />\ngovernance will not alter that<br />\nfact, nor will greater leniencey<br />\nin application of disciplinary<br />\nmeasures. To the contrary, the<br />\nrecently suspended student is<br />\nprobably better off thanw as Larry<br />\nwith his two-week slap on the<br />\nwrist - perhaps he'll find such a<br />\ncommunity and free himself from<br />\nthe common misconception that<br />\nevery<br />\nself-respecting middle<br />\nclass boy should have a college<br />\ndegree, whether he wants it or<br />\nnot.<br />\nJames S. Coleman<br />\nProfessor ofSocial Relations<br />\n<br />\nHOUSING CONDITIONS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nSeveral weeks ago the NewsLetter carried an article about<br />\nstudent housing conditions at<br />\nHomewood. The article mentioned student problems not only oncampus, but off-campus nearby<br />\n(\"bad\" landlords, high rents,<br />\nexclusive policies against renting<br />\nto students, etc.), and, in effect,<br />\ncalled on the University administration to improve things.<br />\nThe trouble with this idea is<br />\nthat it keeps the matter inside<br />\nthe University. It may even put<br />\npressure on administrators to<br />\nrespond to one \"constituency\"<br />\n<br />\n(students) in ways that threaten another (neighborhood).<br />\nWhat could be much more productive is a dialogue where all<br />\n\"sides\" are represented and efforts to handle individual needs<br />\ntogether.<br />\nThere are actually a number<br />\nof common concerns between<br />\nstudents and people who live<br />\naround the University. Gouging<br />\nlandlords who maintain rundown property are a problem to<br />\nhomeowners nearby as well as<br />\nto student tenants.<br />\nOf course, I am sure there are<br />\nstudents who can cite examples<br />\nof intolerance from neighborhood<br />\nresidents. There are legitimate<br />\nneighborhood gripes about students who either regard the area<br />\nas a slum or as super-conservative, WASPish, etc., too.<br />\nThe important thing, however,<br />\nis that both University administrators and neighborhood residents are interested in improving<br />\nthings around the campus. Although it's fair to say that only<br />\nthe latter have really accomplished much so far (better property maintenance, greater pressure for essential city services<br />\nlike trash collection, block organization, etc.), my experience<br />\nindicates<br />\nadministrators will<br />\nhelp if rightly approached.<br />\nThere have been resident-generated discussions with student<br />\ngroups -- but nothing came of<br />\nthem. One example: An offer to<br />\nhave students on our block in for<br />\n<br />\ncoffee at the semester's start<br />\nwas never taken up.<br />\nI've lived here three years and<br />\nthink it's pretty accurate to say<br />\nthat there are very few blocks<br />\nwhere students live around the<br />\nHomewood campus, without at<br />\nleast one resident who could be<br />\nfair to students and candid about<br />\nneighborhood sentiment at the<br />\nsame time, if given the chance.<br />\nHow about a little help?<br />\nDan Gleckler<br />\n2700 block St. Paul Street<br />\n<br />\nSWIMMING<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the many members of the Hopkins community,<br />\nand especially George Kirschbaum, for all the help that theY<br />\nhave given the swimming team in<br />\nthe past month....<br />\n. . \u2022<br />\nI believe George Kirschbaum<br />\nhas done an excellent job as Sport<br />\nEditor this past year, andIwould<br />\nlike to take this opportunity to<br />\npublically thank him.

Sargent signed the<br />\nbill \"to permit its sponsors to seek their<br />\nday in the nation's highest court.\"<br />\nState Attorney General Robert Quinn<br />\nintends to file suite immediately on behalf of several Massachusetts servicemen. Because the state is a party to the<br />\ncase the Supreme Court w ill have original<br />\njurisdiction to the case under Article II<br />\nof the Constitution.<br />\nThe Reverend John M.Wells,a 44 year<br />\nold Unitarian minister, conceived and<br />\nwrote the bill. \"We are saying that the<br />\nConstitution is the supreme law of the<br />\nland for the President as well as the<br />\ncitizens,\" he stated.<br />\n<br />\nCoMmittee meeting a plank of the platform called for joining in efforts like the<br />\none in Massachusetts.<br />\nWhen questioned about the bill's constitutionality, Professor Alexander M.<br />\nBickel of Yale said, \"It seems to me nothing more than asymbolic blow.Further,<br />\nhe contends that the merits of the case<br />\nwere not involved by the presence of the<br />\nstate. However,Professor Bickel had not,<br />\nat the time of these assertions, read the<br />\nwhole bill.<br />\nThe lower courts have usually been<br />\nthe place where individual resisters have<br />\nhad to go. These courts have not allowed the defense to base its case on the<br />\nwar's constitutionality in the past. Appeals to the Supreme Court have consistently been refused.<br />\n<br />\nMany Questions<br />\nAlan M.

OnSunday, April 5, an anti-abortion pastoral<br />\nletter from Lawrence Cardinal Sheen,<br />\nArchbishop of Baltimore, was read from<br />\nover 150 pulpits. And on TV Cardinal<br />\nSheen urged \"all Catholics of good conscience\" to vigorously oppose the bill.<br />\nOf the registered voters in Maryland,<br />\n22% are Catholic.<br />\nThe new bill would leave the decision<br />\non terminating a pregnancy up to a woman and her doctor, while the abortion<br />\nitself would have to be done in a hospital.<br />\nUnlike the recently passed Hawaii law,<br />\nthe Maryland bill does not have a resi-<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITTONE<br />\nCOFFEE SHOP<br />\n<br />\ndency requirement. If Mandel signs the<br />\nbill, Maryland will have the most liberal<br />\nabortion law in the nation.<br />\nMandel will hold hearings on the measure later this month, and he will make<br />\na decision whether to sign or veto the bill<br />\nby May 1.<br />\nCoordinating the supporters of the new<br />\nlaw<br />\nis the Maryland Committee for<br />\nAbortion Law Repeal, headed by David<br />\nHess, a Hopkins medical student.<br />\nAmong the major religious groups officially supporting the new bill are the<br />\nNational Council of Jewish Women, the<br />\nMethodist Board of Christian Social Concern, the Unitarian Church, key segments of the Lutheran Church, and the<br />\n'7th Day Adventists.<br />\nHess said that he was getting conflicting reports on which way Mandel<br />\nwas leaning on signing the bill.

The previous week it passed the Senate Judicial<br />\nProceedings Committee and the Senate<br />\nin an emasculated form.<br />\nSenator Julian Lapides, the phone<br />\nlegislation's sponsor, remarked that the<br />\nbill's failure resulted from its lateness<br />\nentering the session and from a number<br />\nof irregularities in the House committee's procedures.<br />\n\"The bill was slowed down for some<br />\nreason,\" stated Lapides. \"It wasn't<br />\ndistributed at the (House) Committee's<br />\nmeeting--it was still in the files in their<br />\ncommittee room. That doesn't normally<br />\nhappen,\" he noted.<br />\nThe bill was never acted upon by the<br />\nHouse<br />\ncommittee before the session<br />\nclosed. If it had passed this committtee,<br />\nthe two final steps would have been passage in the General Assembly and the<br />\nGovernor's signature.<br />\nMandel had previously told Lapides<br />\nand the students who testified for the<br />\ntelephone bill that it was \"good legislation.\"<br />\nLapides said that it is impossible to<br />\ntell what effect the strong disapproval of<br />\nthe telephone company had on the bill's<br />\nfailure. However, Lapides commented,<br />\n\"The telephone company was very dis-<br />\n<br />\npleased with the bill and they have many<br />\nfriends in Annapolis.\"<br />\nIn the Senate Judicial Proceedings<br />\nCommittee, the telephone bill was ratified after its first section was stricken.<br />\nThis section contained the guts of the<br />\nbill; it would have legally banned any<br />\ntelephone employee from monitoring<br />\ntelephone lines without the customer's<br />\nknowledge.<br />\nThe parts of the bill that originally<br />\npassed would prohibit any phone employee<br />\nfrom divulging information obtained from<br />\na subscriber's line card. Such violations<br />\nwould result in a fine not exceeding $500'<br />\na 3 months sentence in jail or both.<br />\n<br />\nNext Year<br />\nLapides said that he plans to propose<br />\na similar bill next year if he is elected<br />\nin November. \"I want to do something<br />\ncomprehensive in this area next session<br />\nand put the bill in early,\" stated the<br />\nSenator.<br />\nIn another development, members of<br />\nBaltimore's Vice-Squad recently visited<br />\nSteve Blumenthal, the former telephone<br />\nemployee. They wanted to know the names<br />\nof the whorehouses he referred to in his<br />\ntestimony in Annapolis.<br />\nBlumenthal stated at that hearing that<br />\ntelephone test deskmen could listen into<br />\nany conversation in the Hopkins area.<br />\n<br />\nRIPIPPIliK1,IP13.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1 E.

It wasn't planned that<br />\nway. It came out that way because the moment had arrived.<br />\nProducer Bob Maurice and director Mike Wadleigh were ready<br />\nwhen it came. They had called<br />\ntogether a gifted team of young<br />\ncameramen and technicians. And<br />\ncollected a half-million worth of<br />\nthe finest movie equipment.<br />\nWhen what happened started to<br />\nhappen, they thrust the whole<br />\nassemblage straight into the heart<br />\nof the Woodstock Fair. Through<br />\nthree great rainstorms, tides of<br />\nmud, 70 hours of shooting, 81<br />\nhours of sound takes, 400,000<br />\npeople, three day-and-night days<br />\nof discomfort, communion and<br />\nrelease, they caught on film and<br />\ntape for all of history the unbelievable true mass experience of<br />\nBethel, N.Y.<br />\n<br />\nSix months of slow creative<br />\nagony followed. Over 315,000<br />\nfeet of film (120 hours if shown<br />\nstraight) were reworked on new<br />\nand profoundly sophisticated editing equipment, called Kellers,<br />\nwhich allows as many as six views<br />\nof the same subject to be seen at<br />\nonce. More important than the<br />\ntechnical advantage is the simultaneity, as near the quick-silver<br />\nshift and shimmer of life itself as<br />\na machine can yield.<br />\nWadleigh, paired by assistant<br />\ndirectors-supervising editors<br />\nMartin Scorsese and Thelma<br />\nSchoonmaker, with producer<br />\nMaurice on hand to worry, rode<br />\nthe sea of tape and film through<br />\nthe Kellers. Like a group of great<br />\nsurfers facing in to an ocean up<br />\nto now unknown. They emerged<br />\nwith three hours, 10 minutes of<br />\nphenomenon that goes by the<br />\nname of \"Woodstock.\"<br />\nIt is a movie, of course, and it<br />\nis being released by a movie company, Warner Bros.

All<br />\nI care about is how it sounds and<br />\nthe feeling in it,\" she states.<br />\nFor her, the Woodstock Music & Art Fair was a time of great<br />\nfeeling. She was a few weeks<br />\naway from the birth of her first<br />\nchild. The father, her husband,<br />\nDavid, was in a Federal prison<br />\nserving a five-year sentence for<br />\ndraft refusal.

Yet it is one<br />\nthing to be in a group and another<br />\nto go on stage and face the audience alone.<br />\nAt Woodstock, Sebastian demonstrated his powers for the challenge. As he sees it, \"leaving The<br />\nSpoonful was a very spontaneous<br />\nthing.

The way<br />\nout of here comes down to a genuine love we create and follow with<br />\na yearning, painful, fierce persistence. Look far enough over yonder<br />\nand it's a new world coming and somehow the way up has something<br />\nto do with going back to where we once belonged. Joy is alive and well<br />\nin rock and roll.<br />\nEveryone I know feels it. Myths are fading, minds in motion conjure joy and let it be, values come to resemble feelings more than<br />\nthings, there is new music and life at its best is its dance. A feeling,<br />\nyes. It culminates periodically in successive bursts of pure positive<br />\nenergy generated by ever increasing numbers of new children together, reciprocating their music. Woodstock was one of them, the<br />\nbiggest most beautiful one yet.<br />\nAt Woodstock where it all came together, close to the earth, under<br />\nthe sky, breathing clean air we sustained it for three days. Even the<br />\nrain that threatened to stop it while challenging us to see it through<br />\nwas a part of it. The challenge was met, the show went on, the stage<br />\nwas several hundred acres of mother nature. A lineup of the most<br />\nstar spangled, full blasting rock and roll extravagance was up on the<br />\nproscenium, but the star of Woodstock was you, you who were there,<br />\nyou who tried to come, you who wished you had, you who heard about<br />\nit and were flashed with the magnificence and monstrosity of it all.<br />\nWhat emerged was a glimpse of the future, a three day tribal celebration burst full blown from the heights of its fantasies and the<br />\ndepths of its most gruesome fears. It literally rocked the outside world.<br />\nBut to many here among us it was no surprise. Somehow it was<br />\ndestined, a great leap in the continuum was upon us. The energy and<br />\ningredients had been growing geometrically, countless pop events<br />\nprior to Woodstock approached, even touched transcendence, but<br />\nthis one turned out to be the chosen moment. Why then? Why there?<br />\nExamining the coordinates is missing the point. By luck, by magic, by<br />\nsheer gumption, it happened at Woodstock.<br />\nUrgency, ecstasy, idealism, terror. That's what ticks like a time<br />\nbomb inside this generation. Music and massacre exist side by side in<br />\ntime. Woodstock was an equal and opposite reaction to the technological, social and political pressure cooker we live in. Civilization has<br />\na tantrum, youth has a rock festival.<br />\nIt became a three day live-in where food, shelter and joy were<br />\nshared. Authority was missing in action, hundreds of thousands of<br />\nyoung people suddenly realized they could have it any way they<br />\nwanted. A choice was made; genuine peace, love and humanity prevailed. It worked. Joyously, profoundly, we were all touched by one<br />\nanother en masse for the duration of a festival after which nothing<br />\ncould ever be the same. It became a microcosm of a once and future<br />\ndream, a metaphor for a movement, a statement on all the changes<br />\nwe feel. It was an eruption of energy so positive and logistically monumental that come what may, it stands as the best example of just how<br />\ntogether we can be. Everyone.<br />\n<br />\nThis was the \"Gone With The<br />\nWind\" of our generation.<br />\n\u2014Alvin Lee<br />\nI'm glad it rained.

Goldberg mentioned that<br />\nhe and 39 others recently tried for the<br />\nCustoms House sit-in might face severe<br />\nlegal action if they repeated last month's<br />\ndemonstration.<br />\nThe culmination of the Moratorium<br />\nactivities will be a \"Vigil for Peace to<br />\nCelebrate Life\" at Federal Plaza. The<br />\nvigil will start at 12:01 a.m. andwill end<br />\ntwelve hours later. Interfaith midnight<br />\nand dawn services and iformal rock and<br />\nfolk music are planned during the vigil.<br />\nAt noon a rally will begin on the same<br />\nsite. Speeches will be given on the subjects of war, taxes, welfare rights, the<br />\nGI anti-war movement, racism, and repression. The Moratorium Committee is<br />\npresently trying to engage a national<br />\nfigure to speak at the peace rally.<br />\nGoldberg felt that the April Moratorium<br />\nrepresented an expansion of the peace<br />\nmovement in Baltimore. \"One goodthing<br />\nabout the Baltimore Moratorium this<br />\nmonth is that we're reaching out to people<br />\nr'<br /><br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nThe start of the fast will be observed<br />\nby a meal and an Interfaith Folk Service<br />\nat the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on<br />\nSunday, April 12, at 8 P.M. and it will<br />\nend at that time on April 15th.<br /><br />\nWillingly Arrested<br />\nState's Attorney Hillary Caplan repeatedly referred to the defendants'<br />\nnon-violent intentions before and during<br />\nthe sit-in. Caplan's statement of facts<br />\ncited the defendants' notification of the<br />\nBaltimore Police Department and the<br />\nU.S. Attorney's Office of plans for the<br />\nsit-in as evidence that the demonstrators had no violent intentions. Caplan<br />\nstated that the defendants used no abusive<br />\nlanguage and offerred no resistance to<br />\narresting police officers. \"It was obvious that they wanted to be arrested,\"<br />\nclaimed Caplan.<br /><br />\nDemonstrator Andy Green being cleared from the entrance to the Customs House. Those<br />\narrested were given probation without verdict at their trial this week.<br /><br />\nWar Tax Protest<br />\nA second focus of the April Moratorium<br />\nwill be to protest war taxes. Leafletting<br />\nto relate increased military spending on<br />\nthe war to spiralling taxes and inflation<br />\nhas already begun in the Baltimore community, according to Larry Goldberg, a<br />\n_co-organizer for Hopkins Moratorium<br />\nactivities.<br /><br />\nAttorney Benjamin Rosenberg argued<br />\nthat the defendants were denied their<br />\nconstitutional rights under the First and<br />\nFourteenth Amendments when Assistant<br /><br />\nThe Moratorium Committee is opening a new anti-war front in attacking the<br />\neconomic side of the issue. David Hawk,<br />\nco-coordinator of the Vietnam Moratorium stated \"We hope to make clear<br />\nto the American public that the economic dislocation which punishes everyone<br />\nwill not subside until the war is ended.\"<br />\nDemonstrations will be held at Internal<br /><br />\nHoBam ANN MOTORS<br />\nINC<br /><br />\nitece44<br /><br />\n1/14ti1e<br /><br />\na/ny *eclat oce\u20ac144-4942<br /><br />\nwe haven't touched before,\" he noted.<br />\nFor the first time, said Goldberg,<br />\nblack groups have been working with the<br />\nMoratorium Committee. Commented<br />\nGoldberg, \"There is no reason why a<br />\nblack person should fight in the war while<br />\nhe's getting screwed at home.\"<br />\nThis month's Moratorium, claimed<br />\nGoldberg, will demonstrate that the peace<br />\nmovement is still functioning and that<br />\n\"Vietnam is still a political issue. We<br />\nwant to show that the peace movement<br />\nhas not been co-opted by Nixon's Vietnamization program.\"<br />\nHopkins Moratorium organizers are<br />\nnot even attempting to obtain Administration sanction to shut down the University<br />\nas they tried to do in October. \"We are<br />\nsimply asking students to take the day<br />\noff to work for peace,\" stated Goldberg.<br />\nThere will be \"Fast for Peace\" armbands and buttons available during the<br />\nfast. Students will also go into the Dining<br />\nHall to persuade people to give up their<br />\nmeals and donate the money they save to<br />\nthe Fast Fund.<br /><br />\n4,h0A<br /><br />\nAUTHORIZED VOLKSWAGEN DEALER<br />\nDOWNTOWN<br />\nMAY WE SERVE YOU?<br /><br />\nEDDIE'S GOURMET SHOPPE<br /><br />\nSALES - SERVICE - PARTS - BODY SHOP\u2014 USED CARS<br />\nVOLKSWAGEN INSURANCE<br /><br />\n3109 St. Paul St.<br />\nOpen till 9 p.m. every evening<br /><br />\nFree Courtesy Bus - Downtown<br />\nSaks Dept.

A proposal has<br />\nevolved out of their discussions<br />\nthat the center, since it is to be<br />\nfor the benefit of students, be<br />\ndesigned and built entirely by<br />\nstudents on a site and with funds<br />\nprovided by the administration.<br />\nThe conceivers of this plan,<br />\nMann and Student Council President John Guess, suggested it as<br />\nan alternative to a \"package\"<br />\nprovided by the administration.<br />\nOne committee member praised<br />\nGuess and Mann's proposal because he said it would insure a<br />\nstudent-oriented<br />\nrealistically<br />\ncenter. Putting the project in student hands, he asserted, would<br />\nfacilitate swift completion of the<br />\nproject and would actually cut<br />\ncosts.<br /><br />\nCommittee Debate<br /><br />\nDr. Steve Mann has proposed that<br />\nstudents design the new Student<br />\nUnion building.<br /><br />\nMany of those involved in the<br />\ncommittees' debate object to the<br />\nconcept of student control on the<br />\ngrounds that \"it is not the students' business\" or that \"while<br />\nit is the students' business, the<br />\nadministration should take a<br />\nhand.\" Other objections voiced<br />\nwere that the students are technically incapable of installing<br />\nthe facilities themselves, and<br />\nthat they might consider it an un-<br /><br />\nCrash Claims Senior's Life<br />\nOn Saturday night, April 4, at<br />\n8:30 P.M., John S. Mowbray, a<br />\nHopkins senior, died in an automobile accident on the J.F.K.<br />\nMemorial Highway near Whitemarsh.<br />\nJohn was an active member of<br />\nKappa Alpha Order. Another of<br />\nhis activities was the Hopkins<br />\nYoung Republican Club, which he<br /><br />\nserved as secretary in his sophomore year.<br />\nJohn was a history major and<br />\nwould have graduated this year<br />\nwith a B.A. He intended to go to<br />\nlaw school next year.

The<br />\nreason for the failure, its chief<br />\nplanners maintain, was faculty<br />\nand student apathy.<br />\n\"Nobody cares,\" said Dr.John<br />\nMann of the Education Department, who served on the Committee. \"If it takes a large drive<br />\nto get signatures, well, then,fuck<br />\nit''<br />\nBob Cotter, head of the Graduate Student Organization, blamed<br />\nthe fact that \"... a lot of graduate students weren't interested.<br /><br />\nThe Discipline Code was aimed<br />\nat undergraduates. Some thought<br />\nthat the SAC alternative wasn't<br />\nm nen better than the Administration's plan. In fact, rules that<br />\nwere common to both plans were<br />\nused to convict the Book Store<br />\nthief.;;<br /><br />\nNo Big Issue<br />\nSA Organizer Jim Cleary commented, \"The students did not<br />\nthink it was a big issue. But with<br />\nthe Book Store theft, it is a big<br />\nissue. We had student support,<br />\nbut not strong. It was mainly an<br />\ninterested minority.\"<br />\nThe petitioners raised serious<br />\ndoubts abouttlieforthcomingeffectiveness of the Code. Cotter explained, \"Individual cases will<br />\ncome up and when they go wrong<br />\nthey will have to be opposed.The<br />\ntendency is going to be to ignore<br /><br />\nSUNDAY, April 12th<br /><br />\n, the Code. It gives legitimacy to<br />\nthe Administration's arbitrariness. It is regressive.\"<br />\nAlso tied up in the controversy<br />\nis the governance issue.\"Whether or not the jdiscipline code<br />\nwill work,\" said Dr. Mann, \"depends on if the University supplies a context of a rational governmental system. The Code<br />\nstuck in the middle of the present<br />\nsystem will not work. Our draft<br />\nwould not work by itself butwould<br />\npoint the way toward changes in<br />\nthe governmental system.\"<br />\nFinally, there is rejection of<br />\nany overall Administration imposition of a Discipline Code.<br />\nCotter said, \"I don't see why<br />\nthe Student Council can't write<br />\na Code.

It's ironic. The Dean Rusk's and McGeorge Bundy's<br />\nof two years ago were right when they pointed to the<br />\n\"danger\" of American withdrawal\u2014the domino theory.<br />\nThey were right, but they had the wrong villain. A neat<br />\ncontinuum of progression from liberal to radical has developed among anti-war ideologists and activists as more and<br />\nmore Americans have come to know the \"right\" villain.<br />\nLast year's peaceful marchers are this year's dabblers in<br />\ncivil disobedience and next year's terrorists.<br />\nMeanwhile, still in this year, most Movement group<br />\nendeavors have focused on the Moratorium\u2014the peacenik<br />\nmiddle of the road. Although most \"true radicals\" frown<br />\non the Moratorium, it has proven effective in organizing\u2014<br />\nOver-organizing, some say\u2014large groups of diverse people<br />\nfor mass political action.

The courts have thus far steadfastly ignored attempts<br />\nto test the Constitutionolity of the Massachusetts law.<br />\nIncreasingly, politicians have been forced to acknowledge<br />\nthe existence of the unacceptable. Maybe next year the<br />\ntrend will spread to editors and jurists.<br /><br />\nFor Abortion<br />\nGovernor Mandel's hesitation at reaching a decision<br />\non the socially vital abortion bill repeal is attributable to<br />\nhis future political aspirations and pressure from the<br />\npowerful Catholic church in Maryland.<br />\nThe Governor has claimed he is opposed to two parts<br />\nlegislation which would give Maryland the most<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nliberal abortion law in the nation. First, that the law.<br />\nwould allow individuals from out of state to come to<br />\nMaryland for an abortion. Maryland citizenship is not<br />\n\u2022 required for any other operation and there is no reason<br />\nfor such a prerequisite for abortions.<br />\nSecond, that the father of an unborn child is not required to grant permission for the operation. If the<br />\nparents of the child are unable to independently reach<br />\nan agreement of such proportions then it is dubious as to<br />\nwhether a child should be born into the family at all.<br />\nMandel is apparently waiting to see if R. Sargent<br />\nShriver will seek the governorship of Maryland before<br />\nmaking a decision on the abortion bill. By vetoing the<br />\nrepeal Mandel would gain strong support from the Catholic church in what could be a close fight for the Democratic<br />\nnomination against the former ambassador to France.<br />\nBasing a decision of such great social importance on<br />\npolitical aspirations is unfortunate with the population<br />\nrising at a tremendous rate and illegitimacy remaining<br />\na major problem.<br /><br />\nBy JOHN HOLLIS<br />\nEver been to a circus? Of course you have.<br />\nEveryone has. But a few weekends ago I went to a<br />\ndifferent kind of circus - no spangled trapeze girls,<br />\nno tigers and white horses.The only things similar<br />\nto - Barnum's spectacle were the three rings and<br />\nthe plethora of clowns.<br />\nThe circus I attended was officially titled the<br />\nNational Conference on Political Justice, though<br />\nthe National Exhibition of Leftist Political Turmoil<br />\nwould have been more appropriate. It was probably the same as any such gathering -- they all<br />\nreveal the conflicts, disputes and insecurities of<br />\nthe left.<br />\nIn the center ring of this political circus was a<br />\npanel of four. William Kunstler, defender of H.<br />\nRap Brown and the Chicago 7, was the star attraction. Melvin Wulf, Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union, was there. And two<br />\nunknowns: Jerry Mandel, professor of sociology at<br />\nSonoma State University, and Robert Mozenter,<br />\nPhiladelphia Assistant District Attorney for narcotics and rackets (the conference was held at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.) Mozenter was the<br />\ntoken conservative, to \"balance\" the panel. Halfway through the festivities Charles Garry made a<br />\nsurprise appearance. Garry, national lawyer for<br />\nthe Black Panther Party, is presently defending<br />\nBobby Seale on a New Haven murder charge.<br /><br />\nIn The Road<br />\nStar attraction Kunstler opened the show. First<br />\nhe read part of Jerry Rubin's book \"Dolt!\", then<br />\nproceeded to proclaim Rubin's seriousness,while<br />\nthrowing out jokes about Julius Hoffman.If Kunstler did say anything about American problems it<br />\nwas so simplistic and obvious as to be pathetically<br />\nmeaningless - \"Chicago cops and Southern sheriffs<br />\npick on long-hairs and blacks\", etc. Very disappointing.<br />\nThen Melvin Wulf spoke, addressing the crowd<br />\nof over one thousand in a voice so flat and pedantic<br />\nthat everyone was soon asleep. As his speechwas<br />\ndistinguished by a total lack of anything memorable, I have forgotten what he said.<br />\nLong-haired pseudo-freak Jerry Mandel was<br />\nnext, putting down Philadelphia and telling inexcusable jokes. A few days before, immediately<br />\nafter his arrival, Mandel's two traveling companions were busted for possession, and he had<br />\nspent the time between then and the Conference<br />\ntripping, staring out of his hotelwindow for police.<br />\nHe was the third strike - the Conference was uninformative and boring, even a failure as a circus.<br />\nAt this point, with the words of closing speaker<br />\nMozenter, the spotlight shifted to the other two<br />\nrings of the circus, the audience. The rest of the<br />\nshow was amusing, chaotic, disturbing, tragic.<br /><br />\nDoing His Job<br />\nPhiladelphia's chief narc, Mozenter began by<br />\ndescribing how unfair the drug laws are, which<br />\nis like trying to convince the Ecumenical Council<br />\nthat God exists.(He has since resigned in protest<br />\nof harsh penalties for drug violators.) Random<br />\nheckling bothered him, he paused. \"Look, I'm a<br />\nyoung fellow myself and I'm just doing my job.\"<br />\nYou didn't really say that, did you? Too late now.<br />\nThe crowd's reaction to Mozenter's unfortunate<br />\nchoice of words need not be described. After the<br />\nnoise subsided the audience realized that they<br />\nhad just done and could do,that the panel was boring and their own shouts and jeers were more<br />\nentertaining. It was like a rock concert, where<br />\nthe people in the seats are often more fascinating than the people on stage.<br />\nAs expected, the auditorium was filled with<br />\nan almost all-white under-25 crowd, mostly Penn<br />\nstudents. Because of this about twenty Panthers<br />\nshowed up. Specializing in high-pressure salesmanship and the production of an awful newspaper,<br /><br />\nthe Panthers strenuously endeavored to collect<br />\nmoney. Throughout the carnival a female Panther<br />\nat the back would loudly shout \"right on!\" whenever anyone cheered, that is, about every thirty<br />\nseconds.<br /><br />\nTwo More Rings<br />\nAfter Mozenter had declared his Eichmannesque<br />\ndevotion to duty the main topic of discussion became whether he should be allowed to continue<br />\nhis speech. This split the crowd circus into its<br />\ntwo rings - on one side the liberals in favor of<br />\nparliamentary courtesy and FirstAmendmentprotection for all, on the other side the radicals fed<br />\nup with the bullshit.<br />\nYes, it's in the Constitution - free speech for<br />\nall. But if the Constitution means nothingto Julius<br />\nHoffman, John Murtagh, John Mitchell, Harrold<br />\nCarswell, et al., how can it mean anythingto people who know how unjust the laws can be?<br />\nTrue, it's a courtesy liberals pride themselves<br />\non - letting the opposition speak. But this little<br />\nnicety is plainly hypocritical, as no self-respecting liberal listens to what the opposition says anyway. And the time has come to stop being courteous<br />\nwith cops, narcs, and their political bosses. How<br />\nmuch courtesy has Ronald Reagon shown toward<br />\nCalifornia students? How courteous was Richard<br />\nDaley in August, 1968? (you DO remember, don't<br />\nyou?) How much longer will masochistic white<br />\nliberals continue to hold worthless meetings while<br />\npeople are sent to prison? Ask Fred Hampton about<br />\ncourtesy, he'll tell you.<br /><br />\nInside or Out<br />\nFurther babbling from the stage cleaved the<br />\ngathering even more into liberals vs. radicals.<br />\nThe issue became the abstract question of whether<br />\npolitical and social change should be implemented<br />\nby working within the established system or outside of that system. An extremely crucial question. No talk about the changes,just about how they<br />\nshould be accomplished. Wulf insisted that the<br />\nbattles had to be won in court. Finally allowed to<br />\nspeak (i.e. ignored), Mozenter advocated the election of the right representatives to legislatures,<br />\nadvocated with such urgent freqency that I began<br />\nto wait for his announcement of candidacy. Kunstler was magnificently ambivalent on this point.<br />\nCharles Garry's views regardingthis topicwere<br />\nmost interesting. In emotional and colorful language he expressed his disgust and frustration after<br />\nmany years of facing the Julius Hoffmans of<br />\nAmerica. He's seen the system liberals want to<br />\nwork within.He knows what an intolerably long<br />\ntime change takes,that reforms are often corrupted or diluted, that progress may just as likely be<br />\nbackward as forward. There is no need to mention<br />\nexamples of this.<br /><br />\nBurn and Build<br />\nTo paraphrase, Garry's message was this: burn<br />\nand build. And you can't accomplish the building<br />\nwithout doing the burning first.<br />\nLiberals in the crowd considered Garry a<br />\ndemagogue and resented his unannounced appearance. Radicals cheered and whistled, their most<br />\nrevolutionary actions to date. Liberals, I suggest,<br />\nshould see \"Z\" and think carefully about what<br />\nhappened to the Greek pacifists who tried to work<br />\nby the established rules. Ask GregOrios Lambrakis<br />\nabout courtesy, he'll tell you.<br />\nWill all of those who agree that change is<br />\nnecessary ever concur on the methods to achieve<br />\nthose changes? The circus convinced me that while<br />\nthat day is coming closer it's still along way off.<br />\nClinging to noble principles, idealists and liberals<br />\nshudder at the thought of revolutionary tactics. But<br />\nfew of them have discovered how difficult it is to<br />\nrationally discuss politics with a man swinging a<br />\nclub.<br />\nIt was just another circus, perhaps. Not the greatest show on earth, but one of the saddest.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nI RETURNS<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nIn these times of crisis on campuses across<br />\nthe nation I find it difficult to believe that the<br />\nStudent Council at Hopkins has maintained it<br />\nstatus as a lackadaisical body. From my apartment on Calvert St. I have watched the Homewood campus regress for several years and<br />\nnow, as an alumnus I wish to offer advice to<br />\nthose that think they accomplish something by<br />\nplaying student politician. For the sake of the<br /><br />\nschool and yourselves disband the SC, and thus<br />\nmake it impossible for the organization to waste<br />\nthe students' money and time and attention. Instead of campus politics you would all do well<br />\nto journey north to Goucher College and see what<br />\nthere may be to see there. Not much I assure<br />\nyou but more than is to be profited from playing<br />\npolitico.<br />\nClass of'69<br />\n(continued on page '.?)<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nApril 10, 1970<br /><br />\nfeatures\u2014<br />\nLevine Takes on Liberal America, the World<br />\nBy ARTHUR LEVINE<br />\nSince its beginning, the Chicago conspiracy trial had fascinated me. Everyday, I would rush to my New York<br />\nTimes to exclaim over the latest judicial outrage.<br />\nFrom shackling Bobby<br />\nSeale to refusing to let Ramsey Clark<br />\ntestify, Judge Julius Hoffman handily<br />\nprovided me with continuing proof of<br />\nAmerican repression. In a long tradition of heavy - handed autocrats, he<br />\nenabled me to keep my stereotypes<br />\nintact. Along with John Mitchell and<br />\nRonald Reagan, he is a radical's best<br />\nfriend.<br />\nAnd now there is a book out on the<br />\ntrial, The Tales of Hoffman (Bantam,<br />\n$1.50). It's not really a book at all,<br />\nbut the edited transcripts of the trial,<br />\nSO we are able to see the full progression of events that was so poorly<br />\nreported by the daily press. The book<br />\nis, quite simply, great reading, because it provides all the thrilling elements of courtroom dramas. Including eloquent defense summations and<br /><br />\nsort of outrages, the defendants began<br />\nto act like the humans they are. Can<br />\nanyone of us say that he wouldn't have<br />\nshouted out when Seale was gagged?<br />\nFar removed from the horror of this<br />\ntrial, we are angry. Imagine how we<br />\nwould react in the courtroom itself.<br />\nThe transcripts, rather than the Times,<br />\naccurately relate what happened.<br />\nThe Times, as the paper of record,<br />\nis what we are supposed to rely on.<br />\nBut thanks to a w.eekly, The Village<br />\nVoice, we know what actually happened<br />\nto the coverage of the trial.<br />\nThe Times sent its Pulitzer prizewinning young reporter, J. Anthony Lukas to the trial. He had understood<br />\nthat he would be given leeway to write<br />\nlong pieces, and that the trial would be<br /><br />\nBy GEORGE KLOPFER<br />\nLike Gunter Grass, Anthony Burgess<br />\nis a highly talented and original writer<br />\nwho has been on the scene for a while,<br />\nbut is only beginning to gain widespread<br />\nrecognition. \"Clockwork Orange,\" his<br />\nmost famous novel, first published in<br />\n1962, started out slowly, but has gained<br />\nsteadily in popularity ever since. Recently, Stanley (2001) Kubrick announced his plans to make a movie out of it,<br />\nand a dynamite movie it should be at<br />\nthat.<br />\nOr a \"horrowshow\" movie, if you<br />\nwant to put it into Burgess's terms.<br />\nYou see, Burgess invented a whole<br />\nyouth argot for his book.<br /><br />\nTHe MACKICAN P1OP1,6 ARE<br />\nMRCP OF VIEMN-4<br /><br />\nTHE\" AMERICAN PEOP1G AREFEV up tom civti, foGrirs.<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\nwould not print a 1,000-word news analysis Lukas submitted.<br />\nThe Times capped its meager coverage of the trial with an editorial prais-<br /><br />\ning the verdict as a vindication of<br />\nAmerican justice. Since the jury let<br />\nWeiner and Froines go, and dropped<br />\nthe conspiracy part of the charges, the<br />\nTimes felt that this was ample proof<br />\nof the basic soundness of the court<br />\nsystem. Actually, after being cooped<br />\nup for more than four months in hotel<br />\nrooms, the jury was split; four for a<br />\ntotal acquittal, and eight for convicting everybody. So, they arrived at a<br />\ncompromise, with the more famous defendants being convicted of inciting to<br />\nriot on the basis of their speeches<br />\nThis is not, in my mind, a<br />\nalone.<br />\nsterling example of justice.<br />\nBut the real truth of the trial lies<br />\nin the transcripts, and they are both<br />\ndisturbing and captivating and they must<br />\nbe read.<br /><br />\nOrange Burgess Clock:<br />\nStarry but Horrorshow<br /><br />\nvicious prosecutors.<br />\nThere has not been enough attention<br />\ngiven to what the trial actually means.<br />\nThe liberal press, most glaringly the<br />\nNew York Times, portrayed the trial<br />\nas some sort of circus, with both sides<br />\nsharing the guilt. Not surprisingly,<br />\nthis is also how the Times handled<br />\nthe police riots in Chicago. The Times,<br />\nas usual, blamed extremists on both<br />\nsides, and, of course, appealed for<br />\nmoderation.<br />\nIn the Conspiracy Trial, the Times<br />\ngot in its swipes at the defendants who<br />\nwere supposedly trying to make a shambles of the judicial system. That is<br />\nnonsense, as a reading of the transcript will show. With Seale, for example, his demands for the right to<br />\nself-defense in the absence of his lawyer Charles Garry were initially quite<br />\npolite and reasonable. It is only after<br />\nsystematic refusals by Hoffman to grant<br />\nthis undeniable constitutional right that<br />\nSeale begins losing his temper. It is<br />\nonly then that he begins to use ghetto<br />\nslang, other than the windy phrases the<br />\nTimes finds so appealing.<br />\nThe \"outburst\" and \"tantrums\" that<br />\nthe liberal press found upsetting were<br />\nactually nothing more than human reactions to a rigged, oppressive trial.<br />\nAfter weeks and weeks of seeing all<br /><br />\ngiven prominent coverage.<br />\nThat is not what happened at all.<br />\nLukas' dispatches were severly chopped up, and they were usually buried in<br />\nthe middle of the paper. Furthermore,<br />\nthe copy editors made subtle shifts, so<br />\nthat when Lukas would write \"Judge<br />\nHoffman shouted . . .,\" they would<br />\nchange it to \"said,\" while reserving<br />\nnuance-filled words like \"shouted\" for<br />\nthe defendants. Lukas complained to a<br />\nNewsweek reporter, \"I wish I had the<br />\nfreedom of Nicholas Von Hoffman of<br />\nthe Washington Post.\" And the Times<br /><br />\nRussian Slang, 1984?<br />\n\"Clockwork Orange\" is narrated by<br />\nAlex, the 15-year-old leader of a street<br />\ngang in some future iron-gray superstate.

Burgess admitted in a television<br />\ninterview that he is \"obsessed with<br />\nwords.\"<br />\nNadsat (teen) is not so hard to decipher as Cretanlinear B, but the first<br />\nfew pages are a bit hairy.

Alex<br />\nhas no interest in women except as the<br />\nobjects of violence and rape. No part<br />\nof the female anatomy is mentioned except the breasts (\"groodies\"), which<br />\nis interesting inasmuch as they drink<br />\nmescalined milk. His only aesthetic<br />\nis music.

Burgess seems to<br />\nbe saying that Alex is only a \"clockwork orange,\" something mechanical<br />\nthat appears to be organic. Even before<br />\nhe was conditioned, Alex was a clockwork orange, capable only of the mechanical violence far below the level of<br />\nchoice of understanding, and the dreary<br />\nsocialist England he lived in is a giant<br />\nclockwork orange itself.<br /><br />\nCO WC tOCOT TACK<br />\nABOUT IT AtJ0-(02C-.<br />\n-t\\.z /<br /><br />\n-11-t AK-PEAK) POPE<br />\nAE UMIKFORMED A60011-AOS ,<br /><br />\nFOLI-UT1OU.<br /><br />\nWHAT WILL 1A.6<br />\nTALK ASOUTP<br />\n\\<br /><br />\n44N\\<br />\nI<br /><br />\n\\<br />\nCORvilliA WitrrP<br /><br />\nPAGE 8<br /><br />\nApril 10, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nIf it got any<br />\nbolder it<br />\nwouldn't be<br />\nbeer<br /><br />\nocxx<br />\nfreilm<br />\nPREMIUM<br />\nBOLDER BEER<br />\n12 FL 01<br /><br />\nIf<br /><br />\nRated \"X\"<br />\nNow playing<br />\nat your<br />\nfavorite bar<br />\nand<br />\npackage store<br />\nHeibrau Limited, Baltimore, MO<br /><br />\nLetters ToThe Editors<br /><br />\nLARRY'S FAULT<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to comment on the<br />\npiece, \"On Vandalism,\" by William Benzon, in the March 13<br />\nNews-Letter. Benzon describes<br />\nthe disastrous Hopkins career of<br />\nan acquaintance he names Larry,<br />\na career that included stealing<br />\nfrom the Bookstore for resale,<br />\nheavy drug involvement, and various projects of a similar sort.<br />\nI first assumed Benzon was being<br />\nironic when he attributed major<br />\nresponsibility for Larry's troubles to the University (and apparently in particular, to its twoweek suspension of Larry for<br />\nBookstore stealing). But then I<br />\ndecided he was in earnest. What<br />\nstruck me most about the piece<br />\nwas Benzon's apparent assumption that none of this was really<br />\nLarry's fault, that he could not<br />\nbe held responsible for his<br />\nactions, because he was being<br />\nterribly oppressed, by the University and others. Such a philosophy may be temporarily soothing, but it does a disservice to<br />\none who holds it. It lulls him into<br />\na false sense that he can be sheltered from the consequences of<br />\nhis actions, when in the long run,<br />\nit is he and only he who must live<br />\nwith those consequences.<br />\nI believe, as Benzon does, that<br />\nthe approrpriate environment<br />\nfor Larry was probably a close<br />\ncommunity which would both support and constrain him, to which<br />\nhe was bound by mutual obliga-<br /><br />\ntion. But universities are not, and<br />\nhave never been, such communities. They are lonelier places,<br />\npsychologically unsuitable for<br />\nmany, and tension-inducing at<br />\nbest. Reforms in university<br />\ngovernance will not alter that<br />\nfact, nor will greater leniencey<br />\nin application of disciplinary<br />\nmeasures. To the contrary, the<br />\nrecently suspended student is<br />\nprobably better off thanw as Larry<br />\nwith his two-week slap on the<br />\nwrist - perhaps he'll find such a<br />\ncommunity and free himself from<br />\nthe common misconception that<br />\nevery<br />\nself-respecting middle<br />\nclass boy should have a college<br />\ndegree, whether he wants it or<br />\nnot.<br />\nJames S. Coleman<br />\nProfessor ofSocial Relations<br /><br />\nHOUSING CONDITIONS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nSeveral weeks ago the NewsLetter carried an article about<br />\nstudent housing conditions at<br />\nHomewood. The article mentioned student problems not only oncampus, but off-campus nearby<br />\n(\"bad\" landlords, high rents,<br />\nexclusive policies against renting<br />\nto students, etc.), and, in effect,<br />\ncalled on the University administration to improve things.<br />\nThe trouble with this idea is<br />\nthat it keeps the matter inside<br />\nthe University. It may even put<br />\npressure on administrators to<br />\nrespond to one \"constituency\"<br /><br />\n(students) in ways that threaten another (neighborhood).<br />\nWhat could be much more productive is a dialogue where all<br />\n\"sides\" are represented and efforts to handle individual needs<br />\ntogether.<br />\nThere are actually a number<br />\nof common concerns between<br />\nstudents and people who live<br />\naround the University. Gouging<br />\nlandlords who maintain rundown property are a problem to<br />\nhomeowners nearby as well as<br />\nto student tenants.<br />\nOf course, I am sure there are<br />\nstudents who can cite examples<br />\nof intolerance from neighborhood<br />\nresidents. There are legitimate<br />\nneighborhood gripes about students who either regard the area<br />\nas a slum or as super-conservative, WASPish, etc., too.<br />\nThe important thing, however,<br />\nis that both University administrators and neighborhood residents are interested in improving<br />\nthings around the campus. Although it's fair to say that only<br />\nthe latter have really accomplished much so far (better property maintenance, greater pressure for essential city services<br />\nlike trash collection, block organization, etc.), my experience<br />\nindicates<br />\nadministrators will<br />\nhelp if rightly approached.<br />\nThere have been resident-generated discussions with student<br />\ngroups -- but nothing came of<br />\nthem. One example: An offer to<br />\nhave students on our block in for<br /><br />\ncoffee at the semester's start<br />\nwas never taken up.<br />\nI've lived here three years and<br />\nthink it's pretty accurate to say<br />\nthat there are very few blocks<br />\nwhere students live around the<br />\nHomewood campus, without at<br />\nleast one resident who could be<br />\nfair to students and candid about<br />\nneighborhood sentiment at the<br />\nsame time, if given the chance.<br />\nHow about a little help?<br />\nDan Gleckler<br />\n2700 block St. Paul Street<br /><br />\nSWIMMING<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the many members of the Hopkins community,<br />\nand especially George Kirschbaum, for all the help that theY<br />\nhave given the swimming team in<br />\nthe past month....<br />\n. . \u2022<br />\nI believe George Kirschbaum<br />\nhas done an excellent job as Sport<br />\nEditor this past year, andIwould<br />\nlike to take this opportunity to<br />\npublically thank him.

Sargent signed the<br />\nbill \"to permit its sponsors to seek their<br />\nday in the nation's highest court.\"<br />\nState Attorney General Robert Quinn<br />\nintends to file suite immediately on behalf of several Massachusetts servicemen. Because the state is a party to the<br />\ncase the Supreme Court w ill have original<br />\njurisdiction to the case under Article II<br />\nof the Constitution.<br />\nThe Reverend John M.Wells,a 44 year<br />\nold Unitarian minister, conceived and<br />\nwrote the bill. \"We are saying that the<br />\nConstitution is the supreme law of the<br />\nland for the President as well as the<br />\ncitizens,\" he stated.<br /><br />\nCoMmittee meeting a plank of the platform called for joining in efforts like the<br />\none in Massachusetts.<br />\nWhen questioned about the bill's constitutionality, Professor Alexander M.<br />\nBickel of Yale said, \"It seems to me nothing more than asymbolic blow.Further,<br />\nhe contends that the merits of the case<br />\nwere not involved by the presence of the<br />\nstate.

OnSunday, April 5, an anti-abortion pastoral<br />\nletter from Lawrence Cardinal Sheen,<br />\nArchbishop of Baltimore, was read from<br />\nover 150 pulpits. And on TV Cardinal<br />\nSheen urged \"all Catholics of good conscience\" to vigorously oppose the bill.<br />\nOf the registered voters in Maryland,<br />\n22% are Catholic.<br />\nThe new bill would leave the decision<br />\non terminating a pregnancy up to a woman and her doctor, while the abortion<br />\nitself would have to be done in a hospital.<br />\nUnlike the recently passed Hawaii law,<br />\nthe Maryland bill does not have a resi-<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITTONE<br />\nCOFFEE SHOP<br /><br />\ndency requirement.

The previous week it passed the Senate Judicial<br />\nProceedings Committee and the Senate<br />\nin an emasculated form.<br />\nSenator Julian Lapides, the phone<br />\nlegislation's sponsor, remarked that the<br />\nbill's failure resulted from its lateness<br />\nentering the session and from a number<br />\nof irregularities in the House committee's procedures.<br />\n\"The bill was slowed down for some<br />\nreason,\" stated Lapides. \"It wasn't<br />\ndistributed at the (House) Committee's<br />\nmeeting--it was still in the files in their<br />\ncommittee room. That doesn't normally<br />\nhappen,\" he noted.<br />\nThe bill was never acted upon by the<br />\nHouse<br />\ncommittee before the session<br />\nclosed. If it had passed this committtee,<br />\nthe two final steps would have been passage in the General Assembly and the<br />\nGovernor's signature.<br />\nMandel had previously told Lapides<br />\nand the students who testified for the<br />\ntelephone bill that it was \"good legislation.\"<br />\nLapides said that it is impossible to<br />\ntell what effect the strong disapproval of<br />\nthe telephone company had on the bill's<br />\nfailure. However, Lapides commented,<br />\n\"The telephone company was very dis-<br /><br />\npleased with the bill and they have many<br />\nfriends in Annapolis.\"<br />\nIn the Senate Judicial Proceedings<br />\nCommittee, the telephone bill was ratified after its first section was stricken.<br />\nThis section contained the guts of the<br />\nbill; it would have legally banned any<br />\ntelephone employee from monitoring<br />\ntelephone lines without the customer's<br />\nknowledge.<br />\nThe parts of the bill that originally<br />\npassed would prohibit any phone employee<br />\nfrom divulging information obtained from<br />\na subscriber's line card.

It wasn't planned that<br />\nway. It came out that way because the moment had arrived.<br />\nProducer Bob Maurice and director Mike Wadleigh were ready<br />\nwhen it came. They had called<br />\ntogether a gifted team of young<br />\ncameramen and technicians. And<br />\ncollected a half-million worth of<br />\nthe finest movie equipment.<br />\nWhen what happened started to<br />\nhappen, they thrust the whole<br />\nassemblage straight into the heart<br />\nof the Woodstock Fair. Through<br />\nthree great rainstorms, tides of<br />\nmud, 70 hours of shooting, 81<br />\nhours of sound takes, 400,000<br />\npeople, three day-and-night days<br />\nof discomfort, communion and<br />\nrelease, they caught on film and<br />\ntape for all of history the unbelievable true mass experience of<br />\nBethel, N.Y.<br /><br />\nSix months of slow creative<br />\nagony followed. Over 315,000<br />\nfeet of film (120 hours if shown<br />\nstraight) were reworked on new<br />\nand profoundly sophisticated editing equipment, called Kellers,<br />\nwhich allows as many as six views<br />\nof the same subject to be seen at<br />\nonce. More important than the<br />\ntechnical advantage is the simultaneity, as near the quick-silver<br />\nshift and shimmer of life itself as<br />\na machine can yield.<br />\nWadleigh, paired by assistant<br />\ndirectors-supervising editors<br />\nMartin Scorsese and Thelma<br />\nSchoonmaker, with producer<br />\nMaurice on hand to worry, rode<br />\nthe sea of tape and film through<br />\nthe Kellers. Like a group of great<br />\nsurfers facing in to an ocean up<br />\nto now unknown. They emerged<br />\nwith three hours, 10 minutes of<br />\nphenomenon that goes by the<br />\nname of \"Woodstock.\"<br />\nIt is a movie, of course, and it<br />\nis being released by a movie company, Warner Bros.

All<br />\nI care about is how it sounds and<br />\nthe feeling in it,\" she states.<br />\nFor her, the Woodstock Music &amp; Art Fair was a time of great<br />\nfeeling.

Yet it is one<br />\nthing to be in a group and another<br />\nto go on stage and face the audience alone.<br />\nAt Woodstock, Sebastian demonstrated his powers for the challenge. As he sees it, \"leaving The<br />\nSpoonful was a very spontaneous<br />\nthing.

The way<br />\nout of here comes down to a genuine love we create and follow with<br />\na yearning, painful, fierce persistence. Look far enough over yonder<br />\nand it's a new world coming and somehow the way up has something<br />\nto do with going back to where we once belonged. Joy is alive and well<br />\nin rock and roll.<br />\nEveryone I know feels it. Myths are fading, minds in motion conjure joy and let it be, values come to resemble feelings more than<br />\nthings, there is new music and life at its best is its dance. A feeling,<br />\nyes. It culminates periodically in successive bursts of pure positive<br />\nenergy generated by ever increasing numbers of new children together, reciprocating their music. Woodstock was one of them, the<br />\nbiggest most beautiful one yet.<br />\nAt Woodstock where it all came together, close to the earth, under<br />\nthe sky, breathing clean air we sustained it for three days. Even the<br />\nrain that threatened to stop it while challenging us to see it through<br />\nwas a part of it. The challenge was met, the show went on, the stage<br />\nwas several hundred acres of mother nature. A lineup of the most<br />\nstar spangled, full blasting rock and roll extravagance was up on the<br />\nproscenium, but the star of Woodstock was you, you who were there,<br />\nyou who tried to come, you who wished you had, you who heard about<br />\nit and were flashed with the magnificence and monstrosity of it all.<br />\nWhat emerged was a glimpse of the future, a three day tribal celebration burst full blown from the heights of its fantasies and the<br />\ndepths of its most gruesome fears. It literally rocked the outside world.<br />\nBut to many here among us it was no surprise. Somehow it was<br />\ndestined, a great leap in the continuum was upon us. The energy and<br />\ningredients had been growing geometrically, countless pop events<br />\nprior to Woodstock approached, even touched transcendence, but<br />\nthis one turned out to be the chosen moment. Why then? Why there?<br />\nExamining the coordinates is missing the point. By luck, by magic, by<br />\nsheer gumption, it happened at Woodstock.<br />\nUrgency, ecstasy, idealism, terror. That's what ticks like a time<br />\nbomb inside this generation. Music and massacre exist side by side in<br />\ntime. Woodstock was an equal and opposite reaction to the technological, social and political pressure cooker we live in. Civilization has<br />\na tantrum, youth has a rock festival.<br />\nIt became a three day live-in where food, shelter and joy were<br />\nshared. Authority was missing in action, hundreds of thousands of<br />\nyoung people suddenly realized they could have it any way they<br />\nwanted. A choice was made; genuine peace, love and humanity prevailed. It worked. Joyously, profoundly, we were all touched by one<br />\nanother en masse for the duration of a festival after which nothing<br />\ncould ever be the same. It became a microcosm of a once and future<br />\ndream, a metaphor for a movement, a statement on all the changes<br />\nwe feel. It was an eruption of energy so positive and logistically monumental that come what may, it stands as the best example of just how<br />\ntogether we can be. Everyone.<br /><br />\nThis was the \"Gone With The<br />\nWind\" of our generation.<br />\n\u2014Alvin Lee<br />\nI'm glad it rained.

He has<br />\nmade short films on the careers<br />\nand work of Robert Kennedy,Eugene McCarthy, Hubert Humphrey and President Richard Nixon.<br />\nThough Woodstock was, as<br />\nyet, not even an idea in anyone's<br />\nhead, Wadleigh trained himself<br />\nfor it through a Mery Griffin television special which won extensive acclaim for innovative camera work on such performers as<br />\nDionne Warwick and Aretha<br />\nFranklin.
