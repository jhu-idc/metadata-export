The station is receivable only on radio sets<br />\nin the Homewood dormitories and the Bradford Apartments, which are specially wired for reception. Beyond<br />\nthese three buildings, WJHU is unknown.

Government I.<br />\nThe current situation of student government on the<br />\nHopkins campus appears to be perilously close to that<br />\nof so many other schools where student government is<br />\nin the process of disintegration. As was pointed out in<br />\nthe February 4 edition of the New York Times there is<br />\na national trend of disinterest in student government<br />\non the college campus.<br />\n,1<br />\nLast year in the \"Abolish Board\" movement at<br />\nColumbia College the student body overwhelmingly<br />\nvoted to disband all student government. At Brown University the president of the student court initiated action<br />\nto abolish that body, and the student government at the<br />\nUniversity of Connecticut has become embroiled in a<br />\nstruggle to maintain itself and its power.<br />\nThat student government at Hopkins is inefficient,<br />\ninophazarti, and apathetic can not be denied. Moreover,<br />\nif it came to a vote, we would guess that a very large<br />\nportion of the Hopkins student body would express<br />\nJack of confidence in its student organizations.<br />\nIf this situation continues for long the entire conWept of student government will die on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus to be replaced only by individuals engaged in<br />\npetty power struggles. Eventually Hopkins will follow<br />\nthe path of Columbia and Brown and student governsilent will be voted out of existence.<br />\nIn an effort to prevent such an occurrence the<br />\nIVews-Letter will offer a series of editorials analyzing<br />\n,the nature of student government in general, the faults<br />\nitsf student government on the Hopkins campus, and<br />\nrome eussetc..A Davits to remedy the present situation.<br />\n<br />\n38 Schools In JHU Debate Tournament<br />\nBy MARC RENZEMA<br />\nLast Friday and Saturday, orators and arguers<br />\ncollected at the Homewood for the Twelfth Annual Johns Hopkins Debate Tournament, sponsored by the Debate Council. It was an unqualified success, drawing teams from as far away as<br />\nOhio University and Northern Illinois University<br />\nto the west, Wesleyan University (Mass.) to the<br />\nnorth, and the University of North Carolina to<br />\nthe south.<br />\nThe winner of the Hopkins tournament was<br />\nchosen by elimination of losers, not by the sum of<br />\nthe points awarded by the judges. Among the advantages of this system is that it compensates for<br />\nthe eccentricities of the individual judges. Thus. a<br />\nteam which scores high in points may not be the<br />\nwinner. So it was in this tournament. St. Peter's<br />\nCollege and the University of Pennsylvania with<br />\n302 and 292 points respectively both had more<br />\npoints than the winner of the tournament, George<br />\nWashington University which had 279 points.<br />\nGeorge Washington, however had no losses out of<br />\nsix rounds. St. Peter's and Penn had 5-1 records.<br />\nUniversity of Scranton came in fourth with a 5-1<br />\nrecord and 269 points. Teams with a 4-2 record<br />\nwere, from the highest scorer to lowest, Northern<br />\nIllinois University, Duquesne University, Kings<br />\nCollege, Rutgers University, University of North<br />\nCarolina, Brandeis University and Rosemont College. Johns Hopkins didn't debate in its own<br />\ntournament.<br />\nAdditional Activities<br />\nBesides six rounds of debate, each of which took<br />\nsixty minutes speaking time, the teams were kept<br />\noccupied with activities planned for them by the<br />\nDebate Council. Immediately after registration on<br />\nFriday, an assembly was held, and the debaters<br />\nwere addressed by Ronald E. Puhek, director of<br />\ndebate. Two rounds were held before supper with<br />\nan extemporaneous speaking contest and dance<br />\nbeing held in the evening. The winners of the extemporaneous contest were: first, Dick Kane, St.<br />\nJohn's University, Jamaica; and second, Jeff<br />\nHuman, American University. William Noell of<br />\nWashingon and Lee was awarded an honorable<br />\nmention.<br />\nGiven the choice of three subjects on which to prepare a speech in 15 minutes, the first six out of<br />\nseven speakers in one preliminary contest spoke<br />\non the question whether military officers should<br />\nbe \"muzzled\".

Macksey<br />\ndelivered the second of the Amos<br />\nTaylor Jr. Memorial Lectures,<br />\nsponsored by the Playshop. In<br />\nhis lecture on \"Early American<br />\nDrama\", Dr. Macksey investigated the origins of the theatre<br />\nin America, its British influences, the layout and construction of early theatres, the budding of the distinctly American<br />\ncomic genius, and the evolution<br />\nof both the 'star system\" and<br />\ncommercialism in the American<br />\ntheatre.<br />\nAccompanied by scores of appropriate slides, Dr. Macksey's<br />\ntalk traced the development of<br />\nAmerican playwrighting, from its<br />\nslavish mimicry of English tragedies to the gradual appearance<br />\nof an entirely original comic in-<br />\n<br />\nnovation. He also discussed the<br />\nthe<br />\nAmerican \"folk-heroes\":<br />\nYankee, the Frontiersman, and<br />\nth Negro minstrel.<br />\nAmong the many slides shown<br />\nwere several of the great 19th<br />\ncentury actors in America such<br />\nas Edmund Kean, Ellen Bateman, the infant tragedian, the<br />\nCampbell family, the Booths, and<br />\nFanny Kemble, the niece of Mrs.<br />\nSiddons. Also shown were several old American theatres including the Front Street and the<br />\nold Holliday Street theatres in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nThe lecture was followed by<br />\nthe Hopkins Playshoppers' shortened version of Royall Tyler's<br />\n\"The Contrast\", the five-act play<br />\noriginally produced in 1787 and<br />\nconsidered to be the first distinctly American comedy by an<br />\nAmerican dramatist.<br />\n<br />\nIhritas lilmi iihrrabit<br />\nActivities at Hopkins, athletic<br />\nand otherwise, with the exception<br />\nof lacrosse perhaps, all face recruiting and attendance problems.

J. LYON ROGERS<br />\nDirector of Placement<br />\n<br />\nFirst, the Junior Class Committee is not composed of 27<br />\nJuniors as was stated in the<br />\neditorial. It is composed of 19<br />\nJuniors, three of whom are Student Council members, and four<br />\nothers are officers of the Junior<br />\nClass. The other members are:<br />\nBrian Henderson, SAC advisor;<br />\nChick Weinraub, Lanny Berman,<br />\nDick Ruben, Freshmen coordinators; Paul Koons and Keith<br />\nPayne, Y.M.C.A. advisors; Dr.<br />\nWolman, Dr. McClain, and Dr.<br />\nKokes, faculty advisors. It does<br />\nnot seem that the News-Letter<br />\nhas taken enough time to find<br />\nout the composition of the H4U<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nSecond, the News-Letter editors misquoted me. I certainly<br />\nnever said that the Committee<br />\nrepresented, \" . . . the Junior<br />\nClass or the student body as a<br />\nwhole.\" I did say that the Committee was representative of the<br />\nJunior Class. There is quite a bit<br />\nof difference in these two statements.<br />\n<br />\nFifth, the News-Letter actually<br />\nstates only two projects are undesirable.<br />\nOne is the spring<br />\ndance which the Junior Class<br />\nmay sponsor in April. The reason we may do this is that the<br />\nCotillion Board asked us to take<br />\nover the Bermuda Hall.<br />\nThe<br />\nPresident of the Cotillion Board,<br />\nPete Tuteur, stated, \"If any committee or organization can make<br />\nthe Bermuda Ball a success, it is<br />\nth2 H4U Committee.\" As far as<br />\nfinancing the dance, the NewsLetter editors know that the<br />\nCommittee had asked the Juniors for a certain amount of<br />\nmoney to carry on its projects<br />\nthroughout the year. The Committee was given this sum hy a<br />\nthree to one majority, as I told<br />\nthe News-Letter editors in December. As yet, we have spent<br />\nlittle of this money, and if the<br />\nBermuda Ball is as big a success<br />\nas it usually is, we can put back<br />\nthe money we spent for the past<br />\nprojects.<br />\nTh e other project that the<br />\nNews-Letter finds undesirable is<br />\nthe gift of fifty dollars towards<br />\nthe Student Union and Swimming Pool Fund. If the NewsLetter editors would have taken<br />\nthe time, they would have discovered that this idea was not<br />\nmine, but was Dr. Richard<br />\nKokes' of the Chemistry Department. The idea behind it was<br />\nnot the amount of the donation,<br />\nbut that it showed the administration and faculty that students<br />\nwould do everything they could<br />\nto get what they wanted including giving a donation. I personally doubt that a single CARE<br />\npackage to India helps the billions of people there, but the<br />\nintention is evident. The Junior<br />\nClass Committee was also complimented for this donation. The<br />\nSecretary-Treasurer of the Hopkins Fund stated, \"We are very<br />\ngrateful for this gift and the<br />\nkind thoughts that prompted it.\"<br />\nAnd the News-Letter editors<br />\nmisquoted me, for I never said<br />\nthat the Swimming Pool would<br />\ncost 4.5 million dollars. That is<br />\nthe cost of both the Student<br />\nUnion and the Swimming Pool.<br />\nThe cost of the Swimming Pool<br />\nalone would be 1.5 million.<br />\n<br />\nThird, I have every right to<br />\nset up a Junior Class Committee.<br />\nThere is no law on this campus<br />\nthat says that a President of a<br />\nclass cannot set up a committee<br />\nto aid him and his officers in<br />\ncompleting projects which aid<br />\nthe class. If I have done something illegal, the News-Letter<br />\neditors had better begin an investigation of the other classes<br />\nSixth, the News-Letter editors<br />\nthat presently have committees,<br />\nattempted to alter the reason for<br />\nand they had better condemn<br />\nthe H4U projects.

This appears to be a bit late. The grandstand managers further point out that Sachs does not change his<br />\ntactics to fit the opponents and has not in fact changed<br />\nhis methods in his seven years of varsity coaching at Hopkins. Sachs answers that change breeds confusion. This too<br />\nseems a weak reply in view of his record. The mentor<br />\nsays he is doing the same thing now he did a few years<br />\nback when his teams were at least breaking even on an<br />\nadmittedly tough schedule. But if it's not working today,<br />\nmaybe he ought to seek greener pastures.<br />\nFrom the Coach<br />\n<br />\nA coach's duties are to instill a team feeling into a<br />\ngroup of individuals. He must fit various styles of play into<br />\none coordinated unit. He must keep the spirit of the squad<br />\nup and must be able to bring the team to a psychological<br />\npeak for all of its games, especially the pressure ones.<br />\nFurthermore, he must be able to develop a boy's character.<br />\nIt is in this last category that Sachs seems to specialize.<br />\nSachs admits to being \"naturally disappointed\" at his<br />\nseasonal log, but is not resigned to defeat or pessimism.<br />\nEvery coach must think of throwing in the towel when<br />\nthings go as badly as they have gone the past several seasons for Sachs and the basketball squad. But the coach<br />\nthinks he sees several of the reasons for the lack of success<br />\nand feels he has control of the situation. Until such time<br />\ncomes as he cannot understand the problems he will keep<br />\npitching.<br />\nAt the outset of my interview with the amiable<br />\nmentor, he stated that his team has no one big weakness,<br />\nrather a lot of little ones which have led to disaster. I do<br />\nnot doubt this, but would only add the coaching as one of<br />\nthese factors. I am not advocating that Sachs resign or<br />\nbe fired, but that he alter his style of play in order to come<br />\nup with a winning combination. Not that this has not been<br />\nhis ultimate goal from the beginning, but the feeling here<br />\nIs that he has been too conservative and too slow in adapting to his modern foes.

The station is receivable only on radio sets<br />\nin the Homewood dormitories and the Bradford Apartments, which are specially wired for reception. Beyond<br />\nthese three buildings, WJHU is unknown.

Government I.<br />\nThe current situation of student government on the<br />\nHopkins campus appears to be perilously close to that<br />\nof so many other schools where student government is<br />\nin the process of disintegration. As was pointed out in<br />\nthe February 4 edition of the New York Times there is<br />\na national trend of disinterest in student government<br />\non the college campus.<br />\n,1<br />\nLast year in the \"Abolish Board\" movement at<br />\nColumbia College the student body overwhelmingly<br />\nvoted to disband all student government. At Brown University the president of the student court initiated action<br />\nto abolish that body, and the student government at the<br />\nUniversity of Connecticut has become embroiled in a<br />\nstruggle to maintain itself and its power.<br />\nThat student government at Hopkins is inefficient,<br />\ninophazarti, and apathetic can not be denied. Moreover,<br />\nif it came to a vote, we would guess that a very large<br />\nportion of the Hopkins student body would express<br />\nJack of confidence in its student organizations.<br />\nIf this situation continues for long the entire conWept of student government will die on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus to be replaced only by individuals engaged in<br />\npetty power struggles. Eventually Hopkins will follow<br />\nthe path of Columbia and Brown and student governsilent will be voted out of existence.<br />\nIn an effort to prevent such an occurrence the<br />\nIVews-Letter will offer a series of editorials analyzing<br />\n,the nature of student government in general, the faults<br />\nitsf student government on the Hopkins campus, and<br />\nrome eussetc..A Davits to remedy the present situation.<br /><br />\n38 Schools In JHU Debate Tournament<br />\nBy MARC RENZEMA<br />\nLast Friday and Saturday, orators and arguers<br />\ncollected at the Homewood for the Twelfth Annual Johns Hopkins Debate Tournament, sponsored by the Debate Council. It was an unqualified success, drawing teams from as far away as<br />\nOhio University and Northern Illinois University<br />\nto the west, Wesleyan University (Mass.) to the<br />\nnorth, and the University of North Carolina to<br />\nthe south.<br />\nThe winner of the Hopkins tournament was<br />\nchosen by elimination of losers, not by the sum of<br />\nthe points awarded by the judges. Among the advantages of this system is that it compensates for<br />\nthe eccentricities of the individual judges. Thus. a<br />\nteam which scores high in points may not be the<br />\nwinner. So it was in this tournament. St. Peter's<br />\nCollege and the University of Pennsylvania with<br />\n302 and 292 points respectively both had more<br />\npoints than the winner of the tournament, George<br />\nWashington University which had 279 points.<br />\nGeorge Washington, however had no losses out of<br />\nsix rounds. St. Peter's and Penn had 5-1 records.<br />\nUniversity of Scranton came in fourth with a 5-1<br />\nrecord and 269 points. Teams with a 4-2 record<br />\nwere, from the highest scorer to lowest, Northern<br />\nIllinois University, Duquesne University, Kings<br />\nCollege, Rutgers University, University of North<br />\nCarolina, Brandeis University and Rosemont College. Johns Hopkins didn't debate in its own<br />\ntournament.<br />\nAdditional Activities<br />\nBesides six rounds of debate, each of which took<br />\nsixty minutes speaking time, the teams were kept<br />\noccupied with activities planned for them by the<br />\nDebate Council. Immediately after registration on<br />\nFriday, an assembly was held, and the debaters<br />\nwere addressed by Ronald E. Puhek, director of<br />\ndebate. Two rounds were held before supper with<br />\nan extemporaneous speaking contest and dance<br />\nbeing held in the evening. The winners of the extemporaneous contest were: first, Dick Kane, St.<br />\nJohn's University, Jamaica; and second, Jeff<br />\nHuman, American University. William Noell of<br />\nWashingon and Lee was awarded an honorable<br />\nmention.<br />\nGiven the choice of three subjects on which to prepare a speech in 15 minutes, the first six out of<br />\nseven speakers in one preliminary contest spoke<br />\non the question whether military officers should<br />\nbe \"muzzled\".

Macksey<br />\ndelivered the second of the Amos<br />\nTaylor Jr. Memorial Lectures,<br />\nsponsored by the Playshop. In<br />\nhis lecture on \"Early American<br />\nDrama\", Dr. Macksey investigated the origins of the theatre<br />\nin America, its British influences, the layout and construction of early theatres, the budding of the distinctly American<br />\ncomic genius, and the evolution<br />\nof both the 'star system\" and<br />\ncommercialism in the American<br />\ntheatre.<br />\nAccompanied by scores of appropriate slides, Dr. Macksey's<br />\ntalk traced the development of<br />\nAmerican playwrighting, from its<br />\nslavish mimicry of English tragedies to the gradual appearance<br />\nof an entirely original comic in-<br /><br />\nnovation. He also discussed the<br />\nthe<br />\nAmerican \"folk-heroes\":<br />\nYankee, the Frontiersman, and<br />\nth Negro minstrel.<br />\nAmong the many slides shown<br />\nwere several of the great 19th<br />\ncentury actors in America such<br />\nas Edmund Kean, Ellen Bateman, the infant tragedian, the<br />\nCampbell family, the Booths, and<br />\nFanny Kemble, the niece of Mrs.<br />\nSiddons.

These problems are present<br />\nat any school our size, but it<br />\nseems that we have more than<br />\nour share of them here. My purpose here is not to attempt to<br />\nexplain why this is so, but merely<br />\nto express a long-felt gripe about<br />\nthe fact that it is so, and to<br />\nmake a plea for greater participation.<br /><br />\nwith a minimum of talent required. The band, on the other<br />\nhand, requires special skills. This<br />\nis not to say, however, that these<br />\nskills are not available.

J. LYON ROGERS<br />\nDirector of Placement<br /><br />\nFirst, the Junior Class Committee is not composed of 27<br />\nJuniors as was stated in the<br />\neditorial. It is composed of 19<br />\nJuniors, three of whom are Student Council members, and four<br />\nothers are officers of the Junior<br />\nClass. The other members are:<br />\nBrian Henderson, SAC advisor;<br />\nChick Weinraub, Lanny Berman,<br />\nDick Ruben, Freshmen coordinators; Paul Koons and Keith<br />\nPayne, Y.M.C.A. advisors; Dr.<br />\nWolman, Dr. McClain, and Dr.<br />\nKokes, faculty advisors. It does<br />\nnot seem that the News-Letter<br />\nhas taken enough time to find<br />\nout the composition of the H4U<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nSecond, the News-Letter editors misquoted me. I certainly<br />\nnever said that the Committee<br />\nrepresented, \" . . . the Junior<br />\nClass or the student body as a<br />\nwhole.\" I did say that the Committee was representative of the<br />\nJunior Class. There is quite a bit<br />\nof difference in these two statements.<br /><br />\nFifth, the News-Letter actually<br />\nstates only two projects are undesirable.<br />\nOne is the spring<br />\ndance which the Junior Class<br />\nmay sponsor in April. The reason we may do this is that the<br />\nCotillion Board asked us to take<br />\nover the Bermuda Hall.<br />\nThe<br />\nPresident of the Cotillion Board,<br />\nPete Tuteur, stated, \"If any committee or organization can make<br />\nthe Bermuda Ball a success, it is<br />\nth2 H4U Committee.\" As far as<br />\nfinancing the dance, the NewsLetter editors know that the<br />\nCommittee had asked the Juniors for a certain amount of<br />\nmoney to carry on its projects<br />\nthroughout the year. The Committee was given this sum hy a<br />\nthree to one majority, as I told<br />\nthe News-Letter editors in December. As yet, we have spent<br />\nlittle of this money, and if the<br />\nBermuda Ball is as big a success<br />\nas it usually is, we can put back<br />\nthe money we spent for the past<br />\nprojects.<br />\nTh e other project that the<br />\nNews-Letter finds undesirable is<br />\nthe gift of fifty dollars towards<br />\nthe Student Union and Swimming Pool Fund. If the NewsLetter editors would have taken<br />\nthe time, they would have discovered that this idea was not<br />\nmine, but was Dr. Richard<br />\nKokes' of the Chemistry Department. The idea behind it was<br />\nnot the amount of the donation,<br />\nbut that it showed the administration and faculty that students<br />\nwould do everything they could<br />\nto get what they wanted including giving a donation. I personally doubt that a single CARE<br />\npackage to India helps the billions of people there, but the<br />\nintention is evident. The Junior<br />\nClass Committee was also complimented for this donation. The<br />\nSecretary-Treasurer of the Hopkins Fund stated, \"We are very<br />\ngrateful for this gift and the<br />\nkind thoughts that prompted it.\"<br />\nAnd the News-Letter editors<br />\nmisquoted me, for I never said<br />\nthat the Swimming Pool would<br />\ncost 4.5 million dollars. That is<br />\nthe cost of both the Student<br />\nUnion and the Swimming Pool.<br />\nThe cost of the Swimming Pool<br />\nalone would be 1.5 million.<br /><br />\nThird, I have every right to<br />\nset up a Junior Class Committee.<br />\nThere is no law on this campus<br />\nthat says that a President of a<br />\nclass cannot set up a committee<br />\nto aid him and his officers in<br />\ncompleting projects which aid<br />\nthe class. If I have done something illegal, the News-Letter<br />\neditors had better begin an investigation of the other classes<br />\nSixth, the News-Letter editors<br />\nthat presently have committees,<br />\nattempted to alter the reason for<br />\nand they had better condemn<br />\nthe H4U projects.

This appears to be a bit late. The grandstand managers further point out that Sachs does not change his<br />\ntactics to fit the opponents and has not in fact changed<br />\nhis methods in his seven years of varsity coaching at Hopkins. Sachs answers that change breeds confusion. This too<br />\nseems a weak reply in view of his record. The mentor<br />\nsays he is doing the same thing now he did a few years<br />\nback when his teams were at least breaking even on an<br />\nadmittedly tough schedule. But if it's not working today,<br />\nmaybe he ought to seek greener pastures.<br />\nFrom the Coach<br /><br />\nA coach's duties are to instill a team feeling into a<br />\ngroup of individuals. He must fit various styles of play into<br />\none coordinated unit. He must keep the spirit of the squad<br />\nup and must be able to bring the team to a psychological<br />\npeak for all of its games, especially the pressure ones.<br />\nFurthermore, he must be able to develop a boy's character.<br />\nIt is in this last category that Sachs seems to specialize.<br />\nSachs admits to being \"naturally disappointed\" at his<br />\nseasonal log, but is not resigned to defeat or pessimism.<br />\nEvery coach must think of throwing in the towel when<br />\nthings go as badly as they have gone the past several seasons for Sachs and the basketball squad. But the coach<br />\nthinks he sees several of the reasons for the lack of success<br />\nand feels he has control of the situation. Until such time<br />\ncomes as he cannot understand the problems he will keep<br />\npitching.<br />\nAt the outset of my interview with the amiable<br />\nmentor, he stated that his team has no one big weakness,<br />\nrather a lot of little ones which have led to disaster. I do<br />\nnot doubt this, but would only add the coaching as one of<br />\nthese factors. I am not advocating that Sachs resign or<br />\nbe fired, but that he alter his style of play in order to come<br />\nup with a winning combination. Not that this has not been<br />\nhis ultimate goal from the beginning, but the feeling here<br />\nIs that he has been too conservative and too slow in adapting to his modern foes.
