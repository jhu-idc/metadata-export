It was decided that only<br />\ntwo officers would be necessary.<br />\nThe officers elected were:<br />\nMr. G. C. Ober, Jr., president.<br />\nMr. Taylor Starck, secretary and<br />\ntreasurer.<br />\nAn executive committee, consisting of the two officers, ex-officio,<br />\nand Mr. Charles Leland Getz, appointed by the president, will attend<br />\nto all minor matters attendant upon<br />\nthe conduct of the society.<br />\nThe dues determined upon were<br />\ntwenty-five cents every two months,<br />\nmaking one dollar for the entire<br />\nyear. Membership cards will be<br />\nissued on the payment of dues. No<br />\none will be entitled to use a chess<br />\nset belonging to he society without<br />\nfirst producing his membership<br />\ncard.<br />\nIt is not \u2022 intended that membership in the club be restricted to<br />\nthose who have a previous knowledge of the game. On, the con- trary, the main purpose of the organization is to foster a wholesome<br />\ninterest in chess, and to enable<br />\nmembers to learn something about<br />\nit. Later in the year a tournament<br />\nwill be held, and men selected to<br />\nrepresent the club in matches with<br />\nother schools and colleges.<br />\nPreparations Rouse Interest<br />\n<br />\nConsiderable interest was aroused<br />\nand much curiosity shown during<br />\nthe latter part of last week, as a<br />\nresult of the elaborate preparations<br />\nbeing made for the meeting of the<br />\nAmerican Association for Study<br />\nand Prevention of Infant Mortality,<br />\nwhich begins on Wednesday in<br />\nMcCoy Hall.<br />\nAs Walter put it:<br />\n\"Dey's gettin' ready fo' a big<br />\nbaby show upstairs and I'll be<br />\nblessed ef dey ain't jes' natchelly<br />\ntu'ned de whole place upside<br />\ndown !\"<br />\nThe presence on the program of<br />\nthe names of such distinguished<br />\nscholars and philanthropists as M.<br />\nJusserand, Dr. Wm.

This contest takes place at<br />\na small pond, the two classes standing on the opposite banks. In order<br />\nto win, the one side must pull the<br />\nother through the pond. The<br />\nPenalty for defeat is that a green<br />\nskull cap must be worn by every<br />\nmember of the losing class from<br />\nthe date of the contest until Easter.<br />\nLast year the freshmen were the<br />\nlosers. But the freshmen had previously made the president of the<br />\ncollege an honorary member of<br />\ntheir class. So when the green<br />\nskull caps were being distributed<br />\namong the freshmen by the sophomores, in a spirit of mischief they<br />\nsent one to the president also.<br />\nSome of the more timid members<br />\nof the class expected a severe reprimand. But the president showed<br />\nhis ability to fall in with the joke<br />\nand from that day forward until<br />\nEaster he wore his green skull cap<br />\nwhenever he appeared on the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nLacrosse Schedule.<br />\n<br />\nAnnouncement was made last<br />\nFriday by Manager Herbert P.<br />\nMakel of the Hopkins lacrosse team<br />\nof the schedule for the coming season. All but two of the dates are<br />\nfilled and the character of the teams<br />\ntaken on is sufficient to refute any<br />\nnotion that Hopkins is declining in<br />\nthe lacrosse world.<br />\nThe unfilled dates will be taken<br />\non by Cornell and Carlisle if negotiations now in progress are successful.<br />\nThe schedule is as follows:<br />\nMarch 25\u2014Columbia University.<br />\n\\!arch 30\u2014Navy.<br />\nApril 1\u2014Alumni.<br />\nApril 8\u2014Pending.<br />\nApril 15\u2014Harvard.<br />\nApril 22\u2014Pending.<br />\nApril 29\u2014Swarthmore.<br />\nMay 6\u2014Lehigh.<br />\nMay 13\u2014Stevens.<br />\n<br />\nCOMMUNICATIONS<br />\n<br />\nSTRATTON<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nShirt Maher<br />\n<br />\n6 Full Dress Shirts<br />\n6 Madras Shirts<br />\n6 Madras Shirts.<br />\n<br />\n$9.00<br />\n10.50<br />\n<br />\nR.

It was decided that only<br />\ntwo officers would be necessary.<br />\nThe officers elected were:<br />\nMr. G. C. Ober, Jr., president.<br />\nMr. Taylor Starck, secretary and<br />\ntreasurer.<br />\nAn executive committee, consisting of the two officers, ex-officio,<br />\nand Mr. Charles Leland Getz, appointed by the president, will attend<br />\nto all minor matters attendant upon<br />\nthe conduct of the society.<br />\nThe dues determined upon were<br />\ntwenty-five cents every two months,<br />\nmaking one dollar for the entire<br />\nyear. Membership cards will be<br />\nissued on the payment of dues. No<br />\none will be entitled to use a chess<br />\nset belonging to he society without<br />\nfirst producing his membership<br />\ncard.<br />\nIt is not \u2022 intended that membership in the club be restricted to<br />\nthose who have a previous knowledge of the game. On, the con- trary, the main purpose of the organization is to foster a wholesome<br />\ninterest in chess, and to enable<br />\nmembers to learn something about<br />\nit. Later in the year a tournament<br />\nwill be held, and men selected to<br />\nrepresent the club in matches with<br />\nother schools and colleges.<br />\nPreparations Rouse Interest<br /><br />\nConsiderable interest was aroused<br />\nand much curiosity shown during<br />\nthe latter part of last week, as a<br />\nresult of the elaborate preparations<br />\nbeing made for the meeting of the<br />\nAmerican Association for Study<br />\nand Prevention of Infant Mortality,<br />\nwhich begins on Wednesday in<br />\nMcCoy Hall.<br />\nAs Walter put it:<br />\n\"Dey's gettin' ready fo' a big<br />\nbaby show upstairs and I'll be<br />\nblessed ef dey ain't jes' natchelly<br />\ntu'ned de whole place upside<br />\ndown !\"<br />\nThe presence on the program of<br />\nthe names of such distinguished<br />\nscholars and philanthropists as M.<br />\nJusserand, Dr. Wm.

This contest takes place at<br />\na small pond, the two classes standing on the opposite banks. In order<br />\nto win, the one side must pull the<br />\nother through the pond. The<br />\nPenalty for defeat is that a green<br />\nskull cap must be worn by every<br />\nmember of the losing class from<br />\nthe date of the contest until Easter.<br />\nLast year the freshmen were the<br />\nlosers. But the freshmen had previously made the president of the<br />\ncollege an honorary member of<br />\ntheir class. So when the green<br />\nskull caps were being distributed<br />\namong the freshmen by the sophomores, in a spirit of mischief they<br />\nsent one to the president also.<br />\nSome of the more timid members<br />\nof the class expected a severe reprimand. But the president showed<br />\nhis ability to fall in with the joke<br />\nand from that day forward until<br />\nEaster he wore his green skull cap<br />\nwhenever he appeared on the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nLacrosse Schedule.<br /><br />\nAnnouncement was made last<br />\nFriday by Manager Herbert P.<br />\nMakel of the Hopkins lacrosse team<br />\nof the schedule for the coming season. All but two of the dates are<br />\nfilled and the character of the teams<br />\ntaken on is sufficient to refute any<br />\nnotion that Hopkins is declining in<br />\nthe lacrosse world.<br />\nThe unfilled dates will be taken<br />\non by Cornell and Carlisle if negotiations now in progress are successful.<br />\nThe schedule is as follows:<br />\nMarch 25\u2014Columbia University.<br />\n\\!arch 30\u2014Navy.<br />\nApril 1\u2014Alumni.<br />\nApril 8\u2014Pending.<br />\nApril 15\u2014Harvard.<br />\nApril 22\u2014Pending.<br />\nApril 29\u2014Swarthmore.<br />\nMay 6\u2014Lehigh.<br />\nMay 13\u2014Stevens.<br /><br />\nCOMMUNICATIONS<br /><br />\nSTRATTON<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nShirt Maher<br /><br />\n6 Full Dress Shirts<br />\n6 Madras Shirts<br />\n6 Madras Shirts.<br /><br />\n$9.00<br />\n10.50<br /><br />\nR.
