Publicists of our program and similar programs<br />\nhave almost automatically referred to them as programs of<br />\nde-emphasis. There are varied opinions on the meanings of these<br />\nwords concerning emphasis. As for de-emphasis, it is used in<br />\nreferring to the act of ceasing to stress athletics in numerous<br />\ndegrees. The administrators of our policy take one of the extreme<br />\ndegrees in considering it to mean to cease so far that it brings<br />\nabout abandoning the intercollegiate athletic field and engaging<br />\nexclusively in intramural sports. Since the administrators claim<br />\nnot to think along these lines, they refute the using of the word<br />\nde-emphasis in referring to The Hopkins athletic policy, for<br />\nlogical reasons.<br />\nAims<br />\nHowever, the word re-emphasis in the mind of The Nester<br />\nmeans to place former emphasis on something. If that is a universal<br />\nmeaning of the word, does that mean that Hopkins is attempting<br />\nto return to the athletic heights it attained prior to the initiation<br />\nof the present policy some twenty years ago. By no means is it the<br />\nplan of the administrators for this university to return to the<br />\nstatus it held on the athletic fields in those days. Instead, according<br />\nto Mr. Turner, the aims of the program are (1) to put athletics<br />\nin the proper place of the university program and, (2) to place<br />\nproper emphasis on such in an educational institution such as ours.<br />\nIn explaining their use of the word re-emphasis, Mr. Turner stated:<br />\n\"Re-emphasis to us means emphasizing athletics, but only in its<br />\nproper place in the educational program.\"<br />\n<br />\nHutchins Scores<br />\nJust one second before the end<br />\nof the first quarter, Jim Hutchins<br />\nscored again on a short, powerful<br />\nshot into the lower left corner of<br />\nthe goal. At halftime Hopkins led<br />\n3-0.<br />\nThe final score came just twenty<br />\nseconds after the start of the<br />\nsecond half. All Arman of Istanbul, Turkey, once more outflanked<br />\nthe safety man and ripped in a<br />\nquick shot to give the Homewood<br />\nhooters a 4-0 lead.<br />\nDefensively the Jays held the<br />\nOrangemen scoreless by the quick<br />\nkicking of fullbacks Dick Cohn<br />\nand Bruce Martin.

According to Mr. Manning<br />\nM. Pattillo, Associate Secretary Commission on Colleges and Universities of the Association:\"The principle underlying this policy<br />\nis that the essential difference between a good athletic program<br />\nand a bad athletic program is a difference in purpose.\" Mr.<br />\nPattillo continued by saying that \"since colleges and universities<br />\nexist for educational purposes, intercollegiate athletics should<br />\nbe judged on the basis of its educational value.\"<br />\nHopkins Still Lacking<br />\n<br />\nDespite \u2022 the fact that the Hopkins program has been very<br />\nsatisfactory in some aspects it is still the opinion of The Nester<br />\nthat something appears to be lacking. Of course all of the other<br />\ncolleges in this report have not found things going as smoothly<br />\nag expected or hoped, but more than a majority have found their<br />\nprogram very satisfactory, to say the least. The Univ. of Chicago<br />\nis one, like Hopkins, which seems to be lacking something. It is<br />\nthe hope of this editor that our fault may be uncovered in a very<br />\ncareful comparison of these programs with the,one in use at The<br />\nHopkins today. It is for this reason that the Nester has decided<br />\nto devote his column for the next few weeks or so to a careful<br />\ncomparison of the various segments of the programs.

We are of course concerned with the success or<br />\nfailure of campus activities. We do try very seriously, despite<br />\nthe comments of our detractors, to improve conditions here and to<br />\naid any and all of the various parts of Hopkins. This we consider part of our duty to the school not as newspaper editors but as<br />\nundergraduates.

Publicists of our program and similar programs<br />\nhave almost automatically referred to them as programs of<br />\nde-emphasis. There are varied opinions on the meanings of these<br />\nwords concerning emphasis. As for de-emphasis, it is used in<br />\nreferring to the act of ceasing to stress athletics in numerous<br />\ndegrees. The administrators of our policy take one of the extreme<br />\ndegrees in considering it to mean to cease so far that it brings<br />\nabout abandoning the intercollegiate athletic field and engaging<br />\nexclusively in intramural sports. Since the administrators claim<br />\nnot to think along these lines, they refute the using of the word<br />\nde-emphasis in referring to The Hopkins athletic policy, for<br />\nlogical reasons.<br />\nAims<br />\nHowever, the word re-emphasis in the mind of The Nester<br />\nmeans to place former emphasis on something. If that is a universal<br />\nmeaning of the word, does that mean that Hopkins is attempting<br />\nto return to the athletic heights it attained prior to the initiation<br />\nof the present policy some twenty years ago. By no means is it the<br />\nplan of the administrators for this university to return to the<br />\nstatus it held on the athletic fields in those days. Instead, according<br />\nto Mr. Turner, the aims of the program are (1) to put athletics<br />\nin the proper place of the university program and, (2) to place<br />\nproper emphasis on such in an educational institution such as ours.<br />\nIn explaining their use of the word re-emphasis, Mr. Turner stated:<br />\n\"Re-emphasis to us means emphasizing athletics, but only in its<br />\nproper place in the educational program.\"<br /><br />\nHutchins Scores<br />\nJust one second before the end<br />\nof the first quarter, Jim Hutchins<br />\nscored again on a short, powerful<br />\nshot into the lower left corner of<br />\nthe goal. At halftime Hopkins led<br />\n3-0.<br />\nThe final score came just twenty<br />\nseconds after the start of the<br />\nsecond half. All Arman of Istanbul, Turkey, once more outflanked<br />\nthe safety man and ripped in a<br />\nquick shot to give the Homewood<br />\nhooters a 4-0 lead.<br />\nDefensively the Jays held the<br />\nOrangemen scoreless by the quick<br />\nkicking of fullbacks Dick Cohn<br />\nand Bruce Martin. Co-captain Stan<br />\nHenry, center half and playmaker,<br />\nwas a key figure in breaking up<br />\npotentially scoring plays. Eight<br />\nsaves were made by Hopkins AllAmerican and All-Southern goalie<br /><br />\nOur Program's<br /><br />\nPurpose Is Key To Policy<br /><br />\nThe North American Association is unique in that last year<br />\nit became the first organization of its kind and size to formulate<br />\nand adopt an exacting athletic policy. According to Mr. Manning<br />\nM. Pattillo, Associate Secretary Commission on Colleges and Universities of the Association:\"The principle underlying this policy<br />\nis that the essential difference between a good athletic program<br />\nand a bad athletic program is a difference in purpose.\" Mr.<br />\nPattillo continued by saying that \"since colleges and universities<br />\nexist for educational purposes, intercollegiate athletics should<br />\nbe judged on the basis of its educational value.\"<br />\nHopkins Still Lacking<br /><br />\nDespite \u2022 the fact that the Hopkins program has been very<br />\nsatisfactory in some aspects it is still the opinion of The Nester<br />\nthat something appears to be lacking. Of course all of the other<br />\ncolleges in this report have not found things going as smoothly<br />\nag expected or hoped, but more than a majority have found their<br />\nprogram very satisfactory, to say the least. The Univ. of Chicago<br />\nis one, like Hopkins, which seems to be lacking something. It is<br />\nthe hope of this editor that our fault may be uncovered in a very<br />\ncareful comparison of these programs with the,one in use at The<br />\nHopkins today. It is for this reason that the Nester has decided<br />\nto devote his column for the next few weeks or so to a careful<br />\ncomparison of the various segments of the programs. Next week<br />\nwe'll begin with a discussion on purposes.<br /><br />\nLog<br /><br />\nfl'ok<br /><br />\nCOM<br /><br />\nLat<br />\n\u00b0tit<br /><br />\n440* Itig<br />\n\u2014Photo by Glen K.
