Physical<br />\nanthropology and archaeology<br />\nwould not be included in the<br />\nproposed department's area of<br />\nstudy.<br />\nThe department would be<br />\nfunded by a five-year Rockefeller<br />\nFoundation grant, to be<br />\ndistributed over eight years, if<br />\nthe foundation agrees to provide<br />\nthe financial support. Although<br />\nno decision on the grant has yet<br />\nbeen made, Hopkins officials<br />\nappear confident that the find<br />\n<br />\nrequest, for between $800,000<br />\nand $1 million, would be<br />\napproved Rockefeller early in<br />\n1974.<br />\nAlthough some prospective<br />\nfaculty for the new departmen't<br />\nare already at Hopkins in the<br />\nSocial Relations and History<br />\ndepartments, as many as four<br />\nnew appointments would have to<br />\nbe made to staff the<br />\nanthropolOgy faculty.

Only 32, Price<br />\nreportedly is attracted to the<br />\nopportunity to set up a new<br />\nprogram here.<br />\nThe new department would<br />\nlikely offer an undergraduate<br />\nanthropology major in its first<br />\nyear, although the major<br />\nrequirements are not yet set. \"We<br />\nshould have an undergraduate major<br />\nif we have a department,\" he<br />\n<br />\nadded.<br />\nIf the department is<br />\nestablished, only a small number<br />\nof graduate students would be<br />\naccepted, and some of them<br />\nmight come to the department<br />\nwith faculty members from oh<br />\nther disciplines, such as history<br />\nor social relations.<br />\nDecision<br />\nGreene also pointed out that<br />\neven if a decision is made to go<br />\nahead with the anthropology<br />\ndepartment, it might not be up<br />\n<br />\nto full strength by next<br />\nSeptember.

And we intend to do what we can to see<br />\nthat this is exactly what happens.<br />\nTake our home city, Rochester, New York for example. We cut water pollution in the Genesee River by using<br />\nnatural bacteria to dispose of unnatural wastes. We cut air<br />\npollution by using electrostatic precipitators in a new combustible waste disposal facility. We helped set up a black<br />\nenterprise program in downtown Rochester, and we've been<br />\nexperimenting with film as a way to train both teachers and<br />\nstudents\u2014including some students who wouldn't respond to<br />\nanything else.<br />\nAnd we didn't stop with Rochester. Kodak is involved<br />\nin 47 countries all over the world. Actively involved.<br />\n<br />\nWhy? Because it's good business. Helping to clean<br />\nthe Genesee River not only benefits society... but helps protect another possible source for the clean water we need to<br />\nmake our film. Our combustible waste disposal facility not<br />\nonly reduces pollution ... but just about pays for itself in<br />\nheat and power production and silver recovery.

To be sure, there is some overlap<br />\nbetween the planned department of Social Relations and<br />\nthe proposed department, but that happens in many<br />\nacademic areas, and will certainly serve as no barrier to its<br />\neffective operation, if the proposal is finally approved.<br />\nA more immediate threat to the department's<br />\nestablishment however, lies in the Academic Council and in<br />\nthe intramural jealousies and suspicions likely to develop<br />\nthere. Neither Dean George Owen nor Dr. Jack Greene,<br />\nHistory, author of the plan, seem entirely sure that the<br />\ndepartment will ever get through the AC and appear to<br />\nagree that Council action is the most formidable problem<br />\nthe department proposal faces.<br />\nThe fact that the AC must pass on the departmental<br />\nproposal seems doubly unfortunate considering that AC<br />\nmeetings are closed and that the panel has a previous<br />\nrecord of viewing innovative proposals with a skeptical eye.<br />\nOnly, two years ago, the Council rejected a proposed<br />\nUniversity year for ACTION program, whereby students<br />\nwould receive both a salary and academic credit for work<br />\nin the local community. The fact that something might be<br />\nlearned from such community participation did not weigh<br />\nas heavily in the Council's thinking as the plan's provisions<br />\nto pay students and its reported \"lack of organization.\"<br />\nHopefully, this time the Council will decide that expanding<br />\nHopkins' academic offerings is a more important<br />\nconsideration than the yielding to faculty jealousy on the<br />\nmatter.<br />\n<br />\n_UCLA: 1948<br />\n<br />\nThose were the days my friend, who thought...<br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\nTwenty-five years ago Margie<br />\nHellman defeated Jeanne Fisher<br />\nfor student body Vice-President at<br />\nUCLA by the slim margin of 296<br />\nvotes of 3,500. A fellow named<br />\nFrank was Editor in Chief of The<br />\nDaily Bruin then, a chap from Beta<br />\nnamed Bob was organizing<br />\nhomecoming, and an extremely<br />\nintelligent Kappa Sig was engrossed<br />\nin the making of the President of<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nMargie Hellman married a friend<br />\nof Frank's from the class of '48<br />\nwho had made an unsuccessful bid<br />\nfor the SC Presidency in '46. He<br />\nwas later to become the President<br />\nof Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nFrank was to become campaign<br />\nmanager for a candidate seeking to<br />\nunseat\u2014 an incumbent President of<br />\nthe United States, who, in the late<br />\n1940's, was beginning to give<br />\nJohns Hopkins a nasty name in<br />\nCongressional hearing rooms. Bob<br />\nthe Beta and the kingmaker from<br />\nKappa Sig would become two of<br />\nthe \"most trusted and closest<br />\nassociates\" of that Republican<br />\nPresident who made his name<br />\nfighting Communism. And, the rest<br />\nis history.<br />\nLast week Dr. Muller took time<br />\noff to recollect his college days<br />\nwith Manciewicz, Haldeman, and<br />\nErlichman. Since last April 30th,<br />\nMuller and his wife have been<br />\n\"inundated\" in the pasts of both<br />\nHaldeman and Erlichman, mostly<br />\nby drooling journalists who on<br />\ne spiced up their<br />\noccasion h<br />\nstories at the expense of accuracy.t<br />\nDr. Muller agreed---without<br />\nhesitation--to permit the interview<br />\nto be recorded, more for the sake<br />\nof accuracy than for posterity. His<br />\nmood was contemplative, and he<br />\nappeared to be as relaxed as all<br />\npeople who work for a living are<br />\non late Friday afternoons. What'<br />\nfollows is a near complete<br />\ntranscript of the interview.<br />\nQ: What was your reaction to the<br />\nCox firing? MULLER: I thought it<br />\nwas appalling. I was at a dinner<br />\nparty on the night of the so-called<br />\n\"Saturday Night Massacre.\"<br />\nSomebody called the host, he came<br />\nin with the news, and we all turned<br />\nto the TV.

I'm<br />\nnot a psychiatrist, so, in a clinical<br />\nsense, I don't know whether he's<br />\nright or wrong. But I can see John<br />\nbeing sincerely convinced that the<br />\nnational security was<br />\nthreatened\u2014let's say, by the<br />\ndisclosure of the Pentagon<br />\nPapers---and that the other side was<br />\nusing foul means. I can see John<br />\nbeing absolutely ruthless, saying,<br />\n\"OK, if it's my job to help the<br />\nPresident protect the national<br />\nsecurity, a cause I really believe in,<br />\nthen I too will use foul means.\"<br />\nI'm not saying that's what<br />\nhappened. I don't know that. I<br />\nnever discussed it with John---I<br />\nhaven't seen him since all this<br />\nhappened. But that would not be<br />\nout of character with the John<br />\nErlichman I know. Q: You haven't<br />\nseen him since he was relieved---Or<br />\nresigned? MULLER: No. The last<br />\ntime I saw John...(pause)...was in<br />\nWashington for lunch last March,<br />\nbefore he left the White House. I<br />\ndon't expect to see him in the near<br />\nfuture. The only time when he's in<br />\nWashington now is when he's<br />\ntestifying. Q: Just what is the story<br />\nbehind this UCLA connection? I've<br />\nheard that your wife was once<br />\nengaged to Erlichman: MULLER:<br />\nNo, that's not true. First of all,<br />\nclassmates is a funny thing here. I<br />\nstarted UCLA in the summer of<br />\n'44 and finished in February 1948.<br />\nThen I left Los Angeles, returning<br />\nin September as a grad student tor<br />\none year. But I was very close to<br />\nthe undergraduates in the class of<br />\n'49, for two reasons. First, having<br />\nbeen a senior when they were<br />\njuniors, I knew many of them.<br />\nSecond, my wife, whom I began<br />\ndating the year I was a grad<br />\nstudent there, was a member of the<br />\nclass of '49.And that, as I recall,<br />\nwas the class of Haldeman and<br />\nErlichman too. Frank Manciewicz<br />\nwas in my class.<br />\nNow, John Erlichman is married<br />\nto a girl whose maiden name was<br />\nJeanne Fisher. I have known<br />\nJeanne since the first time I came<br />\nto Los Angeles. I went to La Conte<br />\nJunior High beginning ninth grade<br />\nhaving come from Germany.

Q: From what<br />\nyou know about Haldeman and<br />\nErlichman in the good old days, do<br />\nyou think they are capable of so<br />\nabusing their White House power<br />\nas has been charged? MULLER:<br />\nWell, it's very difficult to make<br />\nthat kind of judgement about<br />\npeople you've known in college.<br />\nFirst of all, I knew John Erlichman<br />\nan awful lot better than I knew<br />\nHaldeman. I never saw Haldeman<br />\nat all in Washington (during the<br />\npast five years). I saw John several<br />\ntimes.<br />\n(At this point in the interview,<br />\nMatthew brought in Dr. Muller's<br />\nafternoon cup of bullion.

Q: No thank<br />\nyou. MULLER: John Erlichman is<br />\nas highly principled a person as I<br />\nwould ever hope to -meet.

It was<br />\nthen that John and Jeanne began<br />\ndating.<br />\nOne of the things that UCLA<br />\ncampus politics featured at that<br />\ntime was a schism between the<br />\nfraternity/sorority people and the<br />\nso-called \"non-orgs.\" UCLA after<br />\nthe war was a fraternity campus,<br />\nand the frats more or less<br />\ncontrolled campus politics then.<br />\nNeither my wife nor I were in a<br />\nsorority or fraternity respectively,<br />\nand we both ran as non-org<br />\ncandidates. Q: What did you run<br />\nfor? MULLER: I wasn't running<br />\nfor anything at that point. I had<br />\nrun for Student Council President<br />\nin '46. Q: Did you win? MULLER:<br />\nNo, I lost to, a fraternity man.<br />\nWhich in many ways turned out to<br />\nbe a very good thing, but that's<br />\nneither here nor there.<br />\nBut the connections go on and<br />\non. The SC President who Margie<br />\nworked with was a fraternity<br />\nbrother of John Erlichman. He was<br />\na Kappa Sig.

There seems to<br />\nbe an attitude around that the<br />\nstudent's, even the university's,<br />\nconcern with art should be<br />\nrelegated to the role of spectator<br />\nrather than participant. The<br />\nadvent of the movies on campus<br />\nsuggests this attitude. The<br />\ndifficulties which the<br />\nBarnstormers encountered with<br />\nthe university while producing<br />\n\"Ubu Roi\" epitomizes the<br />\nattitude.

In the past the jayvee was<br />\ncombined with the varsity into<br />\none rather large unit. This was<br />\nthe first season that the two were<br />\nseparated into distinct teams<br />\nwith Coach Bob Oliver handling<br />\nthe varsity and Coach Marshall<br />\nTurner the jayvees.<br />\nWith the recent NCAA rule<br />\n<br />\nmaking freshmen_ eligible to<br />\ncompete on a varsity level in all<br />\nsports, all jayvee teams have lost<br />\nthe usual mainstays of their<br />\nteams; the good yearling<br />\nballplayers. Thus, drawing on a<br />\nfew freshmen with good<br />\npotential but relying mostly<br />\nupperclassmen not good enough<br />\nto make the varsity team, Coach<br />\nTurner found himself with a<br />\nteam that, though long on<br />\nspirit, was a little short on talent.<br />\n<br />\nThe junior Jays played tough<br />\ngames against some tough<br />\nopponents including Navy,<br />\nTowson State and Archbishop<br />\nCurley. Even though they did not<br />\nwin anything in an 0-7 season,<br />\nthe team constantly improved as<br />\nthe fall progressed. Besides<br />\nindividual improvement, Coach<br />\nTurner also noted definite<br />\nimprovement in the overall team<br />\nplay throughout the season.<br />\nAs far as individuals go, a<br />\n<br />\nnumber of freshmen led the team<br />\nand showed the potential<br />\nnecessary to seek spots on next<br />\nyear's varsity. These include Jim<br />\nLowrie, Mark Hertsgaard, Jon<br />\nBell, Curt Hasenhuttl and Dave<br />\n\"Alarm Clock\" Schreyer. Next<br />\nyear, with more active<br />\n\"recruiting\" we should see more<br />\nsoccer players out for the team<br />\nand a definite improvement in<br />\nthe Hopkins soccer fortunes.<br />\n<br />\ndismay was the fact that the five<br />\nlosses sustained this season were<br />\nall shutouts. In practive, goals<br />\nwould come a dime a dozen, but<br />\nin a game they couldn't be<br />\nbought at any price.<br />\nAl Trarnposch and Bruce<br />\nCazenave represented the<br />\nsophomores on the offense,<br />\nbacking up the senior crew of<br />\nTebby Theibert, co-captain Phil<br />\nHieter, Bert Arguero, and Grank<br />\nCurnoles. All that they will need<br />\nis a continuous game experience<br />\nto develop their skills and<br />\nabilities.<br />\nThe loss of this fall five seniors<br />\nmay turn next year into a season<br />\nof rebuilding in hopes for a<br />\nfantastic 1975 season.

I have at various<br />\nQ: How would you compare and contrast<br />\ntimes given some thought to serving in a<br />\nthe Hopkins student of today with the<br />\nfederal administrative position. If, in the<br />\nUCLA student of the lafe 1940's?<br />\nKennedy Administration, 1 had been<br />\nMULLER: That's very hard to do. I<br />\noffered a job in which I thought I could<br />\nstarted UCLA when I was 16, and was in<br />\nhave made a contribution, I would have<br />\na very small minority of men who had<br />\ntaken it. That's something I still would<br />\nnot been in the .service. Almost every guy<br />\nnot rule out, but it's not something I<br />\nI knew had been in the service one way or<br />\ncovet either. Q: What was your reaction<br />\nanother, and it's very difficult to compare<br />\nto Gordon Strachan's famous remark<br />\nthose kind of people to present day<br />\nadvising young people to avoid public<br />\nundergrads at Hopkins or anywhere or in<br />\nservice? MULLER: The system can work<br />\nany student generation since.<br />\nif<br />\nthe<br />\nwhy<br />\npart,<br />\nthere are decent people in it. I feel<br />\nin<br />\neXplains,<br />\nthat<br />\nthink<br />\nI<br />\nfraternity thing was such a big issue. exactly the opposite of Gordon Strachan,<br />\nSome former service guys thought frats. that is, I would like to see the best talent<br />\nwere mickey mouse, and others, like Bill we have go i:to public service---both<br />\nKeene, Haldeman and Erlichman thought elective and appointive. I think that is<br />\nthey were valuable. Probably at UCLA what this country depends on.<br />\nI would hope, however, the model for<br />\nthen, oddly enough, the fraternities were<br />\nbetter than they normally are because the public servants would be men like Elliot<br />\nguys in them were also in the service.<br />\nWith the exception of myself, the girls,<br />\nand a few other guys who were 4-F, an<br />\noverwhelming number of the undergrads<br />\nhad been on active duty in the service.<br />\nAnd their reaction to academic life was<br />\nvery different from those who went<br />\ndirectly from high school to college. They<br />\nwere, I think, more serious students.<br />\nI will say this: I think Hopkins<br />\nstudents are very serio'm not an<br />\nundergraduate and I don't know many<br />\nundergraduates here. But I'm sure the<br />\npresent Hopkins campus would be very<br />\ndifferent if all the guys had just come<br />\nback from three or four years of\u2014not just<br />\nArmy but---war. Q: Did you keep in<br />\ntouch with Haldeman and Erlichman<br />\nafter they graduated? MULLER: No.<br />\nThough I probably would have had I<br />\nstayed in Los Angeles. Haldeman went to<br />\nSC as a grad student, and John, Ithink,<br />\nwent to Stanford Law. I didn't know that<br />\nat the time, I know that from being<br />\ninundated in these guys' boigraphies<br />\nsince.<br />\nI went to Oxford (Dr. Muller was a<br />\nRhodes Scholar) for two years, and then<br />\nto Cornell. In fact, Margie and I did<br />\nreturn to Los Angeles upon coming back<br />\nfrom England, to visit her parents and old<br />\nfriends like Frank Manciewicz. But it<br />\nnever would have occurred to me then to<br />\n<br />\nRichardson and Ruc.kelshaus\u2014people<br />\nwho resign when they feel something is<br />\nwrong and cannot go along with it out of<br />\npersonal loyalty. Q: What about<br />\nresignation and Richard Nixon. Is it time<br />\nthat the President put his personal<br />\ninterests aside and resign? MULLER: I<br />\nthink right now that Nixon is a tragedy<br />\nfor this country. The reason I think that<br />\nis because to have a President whose<br />\ncredibility is so widely questioned as his<br />\nis must be awful for him and sure isn't<br />\nvery healthy for anybody else. How to<br />\nresolve that, though, I don't know.<br />\nMy own appreciation of Mr.<br />\nNixon---and I can be proven wrong<br />\ntomorrow\u2014is that he won't resign. At the<br />\nsame time, however, if he doesn't resign<br />\nthere is some likelihood he'll be<br />\nimpeached.<br />\nNow, being impeached does not mean<br />\nhe'll be convicted. Actually, the difficulty<br />\nI have is seeing grounds for imp achment.<br />\nLack of credibility is not an impeachable<br />\noffense. Whether he has committed \"high<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\ncrimes and misdemeanors\" I don't know.<br />\nHe's certainly been charged with them.<br />\nQ: WOuld not impeachment be as much a<br />\npolitical process as a legal process?<br />\nMULLER: It can't help but be, yes. Q:<br />\nWell, won't it be the same public reaction<br />\nto the Cox firing that made impeachment<br />\nsuch a serious threat that ultimately<br />\ndetermines whether he will be removed<br />\nfrom office or not? MULLER: Yes, but it<br />\ncan't be a purely political process, if by<br />\npolitical you mean partisan. It would take<br />\ntwo thirds of the Senate to convict, and<br />\nthe re aren't that many Democratic<br />\nSenators.<br />\nZiegler<br />\nPeople like Ron Ziegler and Gerald<br />\nWarren keep saying, \"wait and see, the<br />\nPresident will straighten all this out.\" I<br />\ndon't know how they're going to do that<br />\nmyself. If they can, the heat will go<br />\ndown. If they can't, impeachment<br />\nproceedings will be inevitible, if sufficient<br />\ngrounds exist.<br />\nAnd Mr. Nixon doesn't help matters<br />\nmuch. He gives a talk on the energy<br />\ncrisis---and God knows I believe the<br />\nenergy crisis is absolutely real, in fact,<br />\nfrom what I read it's probably worse that<br />\nthe President has indicated--but yet he<br />\nhas to go back to talk about the fact he<br />\nwon't resign.<br />\nThen he goes out to dinner the next<br />\nnight and talks about how his mother<br />\ntold him on her death bed not to quit.<br />\nMy personal judgement of that.is that it's<br />\nnot in very good taste, whether she said it<br />\nor not. It's maudlin, sentimental, and<br />\nirrelevant. It may be relevant to him<br />\npersonally, but what my mother says to<br />\nme on her death bed I don't expect to tell<br />\nthe world.<br />\nIt's a very unhappy situation, and there<br />\nis no easy way out.<br />\nMr. Nixon resigning will leave an awful<br />\nlot of bitterness; it would leave the<br />\nquestion &f guilt or innocence<br />\nunestablished; and, if he resigned now,<br />\nCarl Albert would become President--and<br />\nI don't think that's a great idea. If Mr.<br />\nNixon waits until Gerald Ford is<br />\nconfirmed as Vice-President, at least Ford<br />\nis somebody whose integrity isn't<br />\nquestioned.<br />\nI wish we had a system that allowed<br />\ninterim elections. But to change the<br />\nsystem in response to this crisis--during<br />\nthe crisis---is probably not a good idea.<br />\n<br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br />\n<br />\nPEKING GARDEN<br />\n10% OFF TO STUDENTS<br />\nChinese Restaurant<br />\n2410 E.

Physical<br />\nanthropology and archaeology<br />\nwould not be included in the<br />\nproposed department's area of<br />\nstudy.<br />\nThe department would be<br />\nfunded by a five-year Rockefeller<br />\nFoundation grant, to be<br />\ndistributed over eight years, if<br />\nthe foundation agrees to provide<br />\nthe financial support. Although<br />\nno decision on the grant has yet<br />\nbeen made, Hopkins officials<br />\nappear confident that the find<br /><br />\nrequest, for between $800,000<br />\nand $1 million, would be<br />\napproved Rockefeller early in<br />\n1974.<br />\nAlthough some prospective<br />\nfaculty for the new departmen't<br />\nare already at Hopkins in the<br />\nSocial Relations and History<br />\ndepartments, as many as four<br />\nnew appointments would have to<br />\nbe made to staff the<br />\nanthropolOgy faculty. One<br />\nprospective appointee, Dr.<br />\nRichard S. Price, an associate<br />\nprofessor of anthropology at<br />\nYale, was in Baltimore early this<br />\nweek for talks with University<br />\nofficials and a tour of the<br />\ncampus.

And we intend to do what we can to see<br />\nthat this is exactly what happens.<br />\nTake our home city, Rochester, New York for example. We cut water pollution in the Genesee River by using<br />\nnatural bacteria to dispose of unnatural wastes. We cut air<br />\npollution by using electrostatic precipitators in a new combustible waste disposal facility. We helped set up a black<br />\nenterprise program in downtown Rochester, and we've been<br />\nexperimenting with film as a way to train both teachers and<br />\nstudents\u2014including some students who wouldn't respond to<br />\nanything else.<br />\nAnd we didn't stop with Rochester. Kodak is involved<br />\nin 47 countries all over the world. Actively involved.<br /><br />\nWhy? Because it's good business. Helping to clean<br />\nthe Genesee River not only benefits society... but helps protect another possible source for the clean water we need to<br />\nmake our film. Our combustible waste disposal facility not<br />\nonly reduces pollution ... but just about pays for itself in<br />\nheat and power production and silver recovery. Our black<br />\nenterprise program not only provides an opportunity for the<br />\neconomically disadvantaged ... but helps stabilize communities in which Kodak can operate and grow. And distributing<br />\ncameras and film to teachers and students not only helps<br />\nmotivate the children ... but helps create a whole new market.<br />\nIn short, it's simply good business. And we're in business to make a profit. But in furthering our business interests,<br />\nwe also further society's interests.<br />\nAnd that's good. After all, our business depends on<br />\nsociety. So we care what happens to it.<br /><br />\nKodak<br />\nKodak<br />\n4<br /><br />\nMore than a business.<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br /><br />\nNEWS\"ImER<br />\n1xxviii, no. 21/friday, november 16, 1973/baltimore, maryland/78th year<br /><br />\njealousy?<br />\nBy September 1974, the Rockefeller Foundation and<br /><br />\nthe Academic Council willing, Hopkins will have an<br />\nanthropology department for the first time in its history.<br />\nAlthough the department will not be very large at first, if<br />\never, and will not study anything like all the areas in the<br />\nfield, even the proposed six-person department is a step in<br />\nthe right direction. To be sure, there is some overlap<br />\nbetween the planned department of Social Relations and<br />\nthe proposed department, but that happens in many<br />\nacademic areas, and will certainly serve as no barrier to its<br />\neffective operation, if the proposal is finally approved.<br />\nA more immediate threat to the department's<br />\nestablishment however, lies in the Academic Council and in<br />\nthe intramural jealousies and suspicions likely to develop<br />\nthere. Neither Dean George Owen nor Dr. Jack Greene,<br />\nHistory, author of the plan, seem entirely sure that the<br />\ndepartment will ever get through the AC and appear to<br />\nagree that Council action is the most formidable problem<br />\nthe department proposal faces.<br />\nThe fact that the AC must pass on the departmental<br />\nproposal seems doubly unfortunate considering that AC<br />\nmeetings are closed and that the panel has a previous<br />\nrecord of viewing innovative proposals with a skeptical eye.<br />\nOnly, two years ago, the Council rejected a proposed<br />\nUniversity year for ACTION program, whereby students<br />\nwould receive both a salary and academic credit for work<br />\nin the local community. The fact that something might be<br />\nlearned from such community participation did not weigh<br />\nas heavily in the Council's thinking as the plan's provisions<br />\nto pay students and its reported \"lack of organization.\"<br />\nHopefully, this time the Council will decide that expanding<br />\nHopkins' academic offerings is a more important<br />\nconsideration than the yielding to faculty jealousy on the<br />\nmatter.<br /><br />\n_UCLA: 1948<br /><br />\nThose were the days my friend, who thought...<br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\nTwenty-five years ago Margie<br />\nHellman defeated Jeanne Fisher<br />\nfor student body Vice-President at<br />\nUCLA by the slim margin of 296<br />\nvotes of 3,500. A fellow named<br />\nFrank was Editor in Chief of The<br />\nDaily Bruin then, a chap from Beta<br />\nnamed Bob was organizing<br />\nhomecoming, and an extremely<br />\nintelligent Kappa Sig was engrossed<br />\nin the making of the President of<br />\nthe Student Council.<br />\nMargie Hellman married a friend<br />\nof Frank's from the class of '48<br />\nwho had made an unsuccessful bid<br />\nfor the SC Presidency in '46. He<br />\nwas later to become the President<br />\nof Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nFrank was to become campaign<br />\nmanager for a candidate seeking to<br />\nunseat\u2014 an incumbent President of<br />\nthe United States, who, in the late<br />\n1940's, was beginning to give<br />\nJohns Hopkins a nasty name in<br />\nCongressional hearing rooms.

And, the rest<br />\nis history.<br />\nLast week Dr. Muller took time<br />\noff to recollect his college days<br />\nwith Manciewicz, Haldeman, and<br />\nErlichman. Since last April 30th,<br />\nMuller and his wife have been<br />\n\"inundated\" in the pasts of both<br />\nHaldeman and Erlichman, mostly<br />\nby drooling journalists who on<br />\ne spiced up their<br />\noccasion h<br />\nstories at the expense of accuracy.t<br />\nDr. Muller agreed---without<br />\nhesitation--to permit the interview<br />\nto be recorded, more for the sake<br />\nof accuracy than for posterity. His<br />\nmood was contemplative, and he<br />\nappeared to be as relaxed as all<br />\npeople who work for a living are<br />\non late Friday afternoons. What'<br />\nfollows is a near complete<br />\ntranscript of the interview.<br />\nQ: What was your reaction to the<br />\nCox firing? MULLER: I thought it<br />\nwas appalling. I was at a dinner<br />\nparty on the night of the so-called<br />\n\"Saturday Night Massacre.\"<br />\nSomebody called the host, he came<br />\nin with the news, and we all turned<br />\nto the TV.

I'm<br />\nnot a psychiatrist, so, in a clinical<br />\nsense, I don't know whether he's<br />\nright or wrong. But I can see John<br />\nbeing sincerely convinced that the<br />\nnational security was<br />\nthreatened\u2014let's say, by the<br />\ndisclosure of the Pentagon<br />\nPapers---and that the other side was<br />\nusing foul means. I can see John<br />\nbeing absolutely ruthless, saying,<br />\n\"OK, if it's my job to help the<br />\nPresident protect the national<br />\nsecurity, a cause I really believe in,<br />\nthen I too will use foul means.\"<br />\nI'm not saying that's what<br />\nhappened. I don't know that. I<br />\nnever discussed it with John---I<br />\nhaven't seen him since all this<br />\nhappened. But that would not be<br />\nout of character with the John<br />\nErlichman I know. Q: You haven't<br />\nseen him since he was relieved---Or<br />\nresigned? MULLER: No. The last<br />\ntime I saw John...(pause)...was in<br />\nWashington for lunch last March,<br />\nbefore he left the White House. I<br />\ndon't expect to see him in the near<br />\nfuture. The only time when he's in<br />\nWashington now is when he's<br />\ntestifying. Q: Just what is the story<br />\nbehind this UCLA connection? I've<br />\nheard that your wife was once<br />\nengaged to Erlichman: MULLER:<br />\nNo, that's not true. First of all,<br />\nclassmates is a funny thing here. I<br />\nstarted UCLA in the summer of<br />\n'44 and finished in February 1948.<br />\nThen I left Los Angeles, returning<br />\nin September as a grad student tor<br />\none year. But I was very close to<br />\nthe undergraduates in the class of<br />\n'49, for two reasons. First, having<br />\nbeen a senior when they were<br />\njuniors, I knew many of them.<br />\nSecond, my wife, whom I began<br />\ndating the year I was a grad<br />\nstudent there, was a member of the<br />\nclass of '49.And that, as I recall,<br />\nwas the class of Haldeman and<br />\nErlichman too. Frank Manciewicz<br />\nwas in my class.<br />\nNow, John Erlichman is married<br />\nto a girl whose maiden name was<br />\nJeanne Fisher. I have known<br />\nJeanne since the first time I came<br />\nto Los Angeles. I went to La Conte<br />\nJunior High beginning ninth grade<br />\nhaving come from Germany. And<br />\nJeanne was at La Conte, then we<br />\nboth went to Hollywood High and<br />\nto UCLA.<br />\nV<br /><br />\nthat if the President of the 'United<br /><br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nNovember 18th,<br />\nThe community of Upper<br />\ncelebrated by millions as \"Latvian<br />\nVincent-Willard has received a<br />\nIndependence DAy,\" serves as a<br />\nStudent Community Renewal<br />\nwarning to those who would<br />\nEndowment for Welfare (SCREW)<br />\ngamble their freedom in the deadly from the Hopkins Housing<br />\ngame of detente.

Q: From what<br />\nyou know about Haldeman and<br />\nErlichman in the good old days, do<br />\nyou think they are capable of so<br />\nabusing their White House power<br />\nas has been charged? MULLER:<br />\nWell, it's very difficult to make<br />\nthat kind of judgement about<br />\npeople you've known in college.<br />\nFirst of all, I knew John Erlichman<br />\nan awful lot better than I knew<br />\nHaldeman. I never saw Haldeman<br />\nat all in Washington (during the<br />\npast five years). I saw John several<br />\ntimes.<br />\n(At this point in the interview,<br />\nMatthew brought in Dr. Muller's<br />\nafternoon cup of bullion.

Q: No thank<br />\nyou. MULLER: John Erlichman is<br />\nas highly principled a person as I<br />\nwould ever hope to -meet.

It was<br />\nthen that John and Jeanne began<br />\ndating.<br />\nOne of the things that UCLA<br />\ncampus politics featured at that<br />\ntime was a schism between the<br />\nfraternity/sorority people and the<br />\nso-called \"non-orgs.\" UCLA after<br />\nthe war was a fraternity campus,<br />\nand the frats more or less<br />\ncontrolled campus politics then.<br />\nNeither my wife nor I were in a<br />\nsorority or fraternity respectively,<br />\nand we both ran as non-org<br />\ncandidates. Q: What did you run<br />\nfor? MULLER: I wasn't running<br />\nfor anything at that point. I had<br />\nrun for Student Council President<br />\nin '46. Q: Did you win? MULLER:<br />\nNo, I lost to, a fraternity man.<br />\nWhich in many ways turned out to<br />\nbe a very good thing, but that's<br />\nneither here nor there.<br />\nBut the connections go on and<br />\non. The SC President who Margie<br />\nworked with was a fraternity<br />\nbrother of John Erlichman. He was<br />\na Kappa Sig.

There seems to<br />\nbe an attitude around that the<br />\nstudent's, even the university's,<br />\nconcern with art should be<br />\nrelegated to the role of spectator<br />\nrather than participant. The<br />\nadvent of the movies on campus<br />\nsuggests this attitude. The<br />\ndifficulties which the<br />\nBarnstormers encountered with<br />\nthe university while producing<br />\n\"Ubu Roi\" epitomizes the<br />\nattitude.

The rest of<br />\nthe cast offers support but no<br />\none can touch the pinnacle of<br />\nhilarity which Owen has reached.<br />\nLaura Schlitz, as Ma Ubu, has<br />\ndone an excellent job serving as<br />\nfoil to Pa Ubu.<br />\nDirection<br />\nOccasionally one questions the<br />\ndirection of the play. When the<br />\nactors aren't making the show<br />\nwork through their own'<br />\nefforts,one can feel it slipping.

To the team's<br /><br />\nJayvee soccer season a dismal one<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nDismal is the only word that<br />\ncan be used to describe the<br />\njayvee soccer team's season this<br />\nyear. In the past the jayvee was<br />\ncombined with the varsity into<br />\none rather large unit. This was<br />\nthe first season that the two were<br />\nseparated into distinct teams<br />\nwith Coach Bob Oliver handling<br />\nthe varsity and Coach Marshall<br />\nTurner the jayvees.<br />\nWith the recent NCAA rule<br /><br />\nmaking freshmen_ eligible to<br />\ncompete on a varsity level in all<br />\nsports, all jayvee teams have lost<br />\nthe usual mainstays of their<br />\nteams; the good yearling<br />\nballplayers. Thus, drawing on a<br />\nfew freshmen with good<br />\npotential but relying mostly<br />\nupperclassmen not good enough<br />\nto make the varsity team, Coach<br />\nTurner found himself with a<br />\nteam that, though long on<br />\nspirit, was a little short on talent.<br /><br />\nThe junior Jays played tough<br />\ngames against some tough<br />\nopponents including Navy,<br />\nTowson State and Archbishop<br />\nCurley. Even though they did not<br />\nwin anything in an 0-7 season,<br />\nthe team constantly improved as<br />\nthe fall progressed. Besides<br />\nindividual improvement, Coach<br />\nTurner also noted definite<br />\nimprovement in the overall team<br />\nplay throughout the season.<br />\nAs far as individuals go, a<br /><br />\nnumber of freshmen led the team<br />\nand showed the potential<br />\nnecessary to seek spots on next<br />\nyear's varsity. These include Jim<br />\nLowrie, Mark Hertsgaard, Jon<br />\nBell, Curt Hasenhuttl and Dave<br />\n\"Alarm Clock\" Schreyer. Next<br />\nyear, with more active<br />\n\"recruiting\" we should see more<br />\nsoccer players out for the team<br />\nand a definite improvement in<br />\nthe Hopkins soccer fortunes.<br /><br />\ndismay was the fact that the five<br />\nlosses sustained this season were<br />\nall shutouts. In practive, goals<br />\nwould come a dime a dozen, but<br />\nin a game they couldn't be<br />\nbought at any price.<br />\nAl Trarnposch and Bruce<br />\nCazenave represented the<br />\nsophomores on the offense,<br />\nbacking up the senior crew of<br />\nTebby Theibert, co-captain Phil<br />\nHieter, Bert Arguero, and Grank<br />\nCurnoles. All that they will need<br />\nis a continuous game experience<br />\nto develop their skills and<br />\nabilities.<br />\nThe loss of this fall five seniors<br />\nmay turn next year into a season<br />\nof rebuilding in hopes for a<br />\nfantastic 1975 season.

I have at various<br />\nQ: How would you compare and contrast<br />\ntimes given some thought to serving in a<br />\nthe Hopkins student of today with the<br />\nfederal administrative position. If, in the<br />\nUCLA student of the lafe 1940's?<br />\nKennedy Administration, 1 had been<br />\nMULLER: That's very hard to do. I<br />\noffered a job in which I thought I could<br />\nstarted UCLA when I was 16, and was in<br />\nhave made a contribution, I would have<br />\na very small minority of men who had<br />\ntaken it. That's something I still would<br />\nnot been in the .service. Almost every guy<br />\nnot rule out, but it's not something I<br />\nI knew had been in the service one way or<br />\ncovet either. Q: What was your reaction<br />\nanother, and it's very difficult to compare<br />\nto Gordon Strachan's famous remark<br />\nthose kind of people to present day<br />\nadvising young people to avoid public<br />\nundergrads at Hopkins or anywhere or in<br />\nservice? MULLER: The system can work<br />\nany student generation since.<br />\nif<br />\nthe<br />\nwhy<br />\npart,<br />\nthere are decent people in it. I feel<br />\nin<br />\neXplains,<br />\nthat<br />\nthink<br />\nI<br />\nfraternity thing was such a big issue. exactly the opposite of Gordon Strachan,<br />\nSome former service guys thought frats. that is, I would like to see the best talent<br />\nwere mickey mouse, and others, like Bill we have go i:to public service---both<br />\nKeene, Haldeman and Erlichman thought elective and appointive. I think that is<br />\nthey were valuable. Probably at UCLA what this country depends on.<br />\nI would hope, however, the model for<br />\nthen, oddly enough, the fraternities were<br />\nbetter than they normally are because the public servants would be men like Elliot<br />\nguys in them were also in the service.<br />\nWith the exception of myself, the girls,<br />\nand a few other guys who were 4-F, an<br />\noverwhelming number of the undergrads<br />\nhad been on active duty in the service.<br />\nAnd their reaction to academic life was<br />\nvery different from those who went<br />\ndirectly from high school to college. They<br />\nwere, I think, more serious students.<br />\nI will say this: I think Hopkins<br />\nstudents are very serio'm not an<br />\nundergraduate and I don't know many<br />\nundergraduates here. But I'm sure the<br />\npresent Hopkins campus would be very<br />\ndifferent if all the guys had just come<br />\nback from three or four years of\u2014not just<br />\nArmy but---war. Q: Did you keep in<br />\ntouch with Haldeman and Erlichman<br />\nafter they graduated? MULLER: No.<br />\nThough I probably would have had I<br />\nstayed in Los Angeles. Haldeman went to<br />\nSC as a grad student, and John, Ithink,<br />\nwent to Stanford Law. I didn't know that<br />\nat the time, I know that from being<br />\ninundated in these guys' boigraphies<br />\nsince.<br />\nI went to Oxford (Dr. Muller was a<br />\nRhodes Scholar) for two years, and then<br />\nto Cornell. In fact, Margie and I did<br />\nreturn to Los Angeles upon coming back<br />\nfrom England, to visit her parents and old<br />\nfriends like Frank Manciewicz. But it<br />\nnever would have occurred to me then to<br /><br />\nRichardson and Ruc.kelshaus\u2014people<br />\nwho resign when they feel something is<br />\nwrong and cannot go along with it out of<br />\npersonal loyalty. Q: What about<br />\nresignation and Richard Nixon. Is it time<br />\nthat the President put his personal<br />\ninterests aside and resign? MULLER: I<br />\nthink right now that Nixon is a tragedy<br />\nfor this country. The reason I think that<br />\nis because to have a President whose<br />\ncredibility is so widely questioned as his<br />\nis must be awful for him and sure isn't<br />\nvery healthy for anybody else. How to<br />\nresolve that, though, I don't know.<br />\nMy own appreciation of Mr.<br />\nNixon---and I can be proven wrong<br />\ntomorrow\u2014is that he won't resign. At the<br />\nsame time, however, if he doesn't resign<br />\nthere is some likelihood he'll be<br />\nimpeached.<br />\nNow, being impeached does not mean<br />\nhe'll be convicted. Actually, the difficulty<br />\nI have is seeing grounds for imp achment.<br />\nLack of credibility is not an impeachable<br />\noffense. Whether he has committed \"high<br />\n,<br /><br />\ncrimes and misdemeanors\" I don't know.<br />\nHe's certainly been charged with them.<br />\nQ: WOuld not impeachment be as much a<br />\npolitical process as a legal process?<br />\nMULLER: It can't help but be, yes. Q:<br />\nWell, won't it be the same public reaction<br />\nto the Cox firing that made impeachment<br />\nsuch a serious threat that ultimately<br />\ndetermines whether he will be removed<br />\nfrom office or not? MULLER: Yes, but it<br />\ncan't be a purely political process, if by<br />\npolitical you mean partisan. It would take<br />\ntwo thirds of the Senate to convict, and<br />\nthe re aren't that many Democratic<br />\nSenators.<br />\nZiegler<br />\nPeople like Ron Ziegler and Gerald<br />\nWarren keep saying, \"wait and see, the<br />\nPresident will straighten all this out.\" I<br />\ndon't know how they're going to do that<br />\nmyself. If they can, the heat will go<br />\ndown. If they can't, impeachment<br />\nproceedings will be inevitible, if sufficient<br />\ngrounds exist.<br />\nAnd Mr. Nixon doesn't help matters<br />\nmuch. He gives a talk on the energy<br />\ncrisis---and God knows I believe the<br />\nenergy crisis is absolutely real, in fact,<br />\nfrom what I read it's probably worse that<br />\nthe President has indicated--but yet he<br />\nhas to go back to talk about the fact he<br />\nwon't resign.<br />\nThen he goes out to dinner the next<br />\nnight and talks about how his mother<br />\ntold him on her death bed not to quit.<br />\nMy personal judgement of that.is that it's<br />\nnot in very good taste, whether she said it<br />\nor not. It's maudlin, sentimental, and<br />\nirrelevant. It may be relevant to him<br />\npersonally, but what my mother says to<br />\nme on her death bed I don't expect to tell<br />\nthe world.<br />\nIt's a very unhappy situation, and there<br />\nis no easy way out.<br />\nMr. Nixon resigning will leave an awful<br />\nlot of bitterness; it would leave the<br />\nquestion &amp;f guilt or innocence<br />\nunestablished; and, if he resigned now,<br />\nCarl Albert would become President--and<br />\nI don't think that's a great idea. If Mr.<br />\nNixon waits until Gerald Ford is<br />\nconfirmed as Vice-President, at least Ford<br />\nis somebody whose integrity isn't<br />\nquestioned.<br />\nI wish we had a system that allowed<br />\ninterim elections. But to change the<br />\nsystem in response to this crisis--during<br />\nthe crisis---is probably not a good idea.<br /><br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br /><br />\nPEKING GARDEN<br />\n10% OFF TO STUDENTS<br />\nChinese Restaurant<br />\n2410 E.
