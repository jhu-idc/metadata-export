The game<br />\nresolved itself intO a pitchers'<br />\nbattle between Teddy Welliver of<br />\nHopkins and Kendrick of Catholic University, with Welliver having the best of it all the way<br />\nthrough. The young Hopkins'<br />\nmoundsman held his opponents to<br />\nfour scattered hits and sent<br />\neleven men back to the bench via<br />\nthe strike-out route. In two innings, the first and the third, he<br />\nfanned all three batters, while he<br />\nmade two of them whiff in the<br />\nseventh period.

In order,<br />\ntherefore, to keep together the<br />\nmen of education from whom, of<br />\ncourse, future officers must be<br />\nmade, in order to give them a<br />\nstart in military service and at<br />\nthe same time enable the colleges<br />\nto continue with other branches<br />\nof the educational curriculum, the<br />\nnew plan has been evolved and<br />\nwill be put into operation in September next.<br />\nFor with a plethora of men for<br />\nthe army between the age of 21<br />\nand 31 and with the inevitable<br />\nloss on the battlefield of young<br />\nmen on whom time and money has<br />\nbeen spent for higher education, it<br />\nwould be shortsighted national<br />\npolicy to permit the breaking up<br />\nof any of the colleges.<br />\nThe idea of extending the plan<br />\nto secondary schools has been discussed but no conclusion has been<br />\nreached.

Coleman.<br />\n<br />\nA Hopkins Tradition Maintained.<br />\nLehigh came to Homewood last Saturday with confidence and the<br />\n,<br />\nlacrosse championship; Lehigh left Homewood about two hours later<br />\nwith neither joy nor the championship. The old Hopkins spirit<br />\nswelled up in the hearts of Captain Schmidt and his men and swept<br />\nthe ex-champions off their feet. The so-called weak attack of the<br />\nBlack and Blue crashed through the Lehigh defense three times before<br />\nthe game was fairly started. After the first minute of play, there<br />\nwas never any doubt that the old blue banner was going to adorn<br />\nthe walls of the Barn for many months to come. It was a brilliant,<br />\nglorious, clean-cut victory. It was an eloquent tribute to the coaching system of Hopkins lacrosse, to the loyalty and conscientious<br />\nefforts of every member of the team. Hopkins men\u2014in trench and<br />\ncamp, in France and the States\u2014will learn with real pride and<br />\nwhole-hearted satisfaction that the new Hopkins men have maintained an old cherished tradition.<br />\n<br />\nAn Appreciation.<br />\nWhen Major Guild was elected to the -Omicron Delta Kappa<br />\nCircle, it was clearly shown that besides having gained the hearty<br />\ncooperation of the faculty, he has won his way into the hearts of<br />\nthe students themselves. The Circle, which is the most particularly<br />\nrepresentative body in the University (for it is composed of men<br />\nwho have attained distinction in all branches of university activity)<br />\nhas expressed by its action the high esteem in which our commandant is held by the undergraduates.<br />\nThe faculty has long lent its support to all Major Guild's plans;<br />\nfor example, when the military recitations took precedence over all<br />\nother classes. The students, also,'have come to regard Major Guild\u2014<br />\nstrict disciplinarian as he is\u2014with the utmost admiration. He<br />\n.has given us a battalion of which we may well be proud, a battalion<br />\nwhich is most proficient in military science, and\u2014what is more\u2014a<br />\nbattalion with some spirit. Whatever efficiency and fame the Hopkins Battalion has attained this year is directly attributable to the<br />\nuntiring and unceasing efforts of Major Guild.<br />\n<br />\nRaisons d'Etre of Facts.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nIf there is any one single reason for the publication .of the series<br />\nof \"facts\" in these columns it is the additional fact that the athletic<br />\nauthorities at the University have never felt it necessary to explain<br />\nor defend these \"facts.\" The athletic management seems to feel<br />\nthat, after its mechanical and meaningless annual election, it is absolutely independent and irresponsible. We feel\u2014without the least<br />\npersonal embitterment and without the least claim of willful negligence\u2014that it is equally inefficient and unsatisfactory and unwilling<br />\nor unfit to adjust itself to the changed conditions of war-times.<br />\n<br />\nAt the outset, we beg to emphasize that the publication of \"facts\"<br />\nwas never aimed at any individual athletic authority, but at the<br />\nathletic system. We had no mysterious ulterior purpose. It was<br />\nour single object to give publicity to certain conditions and. circumstances which the authorities never saw fit to divulge to the<br />\nmere members.. We believe that through publicity alone can the<br />\ninterest and the sense of responsibility of all members of the Athletic<br />\nAssociation be aroused and sustained. We believe that it is quite<br />\nimpossible to approve or disapprove the measures and policies of<br />\nour representatives unless we know what they have done and what<br />\nthey are doing. It is by no means our purpose to detract in any<br />\nway from the splendid record of our recognized spring team; for<br />\nthem we have only unstinted praise.<br />\nFirst, we want to introduce some additional \"facts\" that have<br />\nrecently come to our attention. Two colleges of the thirteen that<br />\nare members, competed in the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Championships at Homewood last Saturday; one of the two was Hopkins.<br />\nIn his report to the President last fall, the Director of the<br />\nGymnasium said: \"It is our desire to get every man in the college<br />\ndepartment engaged in some sort of athletic activity, and, with that<br />\nend in view, the Athletic Association has engaged for next year the<br />\n* * to<br />\nservices of Mr. R. G. Murphy * * * He comes to us<br />\nfacilitate a thorough organization amongst the students for active<br />\nparticipation in sports, and to further the interest in all intramural<br />\nsport.\" Mr. Murphy enlisted in the army and was released from<br />\nthe contract. But the Athletic Association last August, presumably<br />\nwithout the knowledge of either board or sudent body, engaged the<br />\nservices of the football coach whose last service to Hopkins at that<br />\ntime might be expressed in the code form: 55 to 0.<br />\nIn the course of the past winter, it was announced that there<br />\nhad been. appointed and ratified an assistant graduate 1nanager.<br />\nThe reasons for and the constitutionality of the appointment were<br />\nnever discussed.<br />\nNow, we are perfectly aware of the Government's whole-hearted<br />\nendorsement of intercollegiate athletics during the war. But we<br />\nbelieve that the Government demands, at the same time, increased<br />\neconomy and efficiency in athletic management; which our own athletic authorities have entirely failed to recognize and enforce.<br />\nThe Athletic Association has not showed any reasonable tendency to economize. It has arranged long trips, conspicuous among<br />\nwhich are those to Providence and to West Point. It has not withdrawn.the annual appropriation of $75 to the tennis team when it<br />\nwas perfectly aware that there was no tennis team (we might call<br />\nit a tennis clique). It failed to recognize the opportunity to save<br />\n$35 by cancelling the Randolph-Macon game; it preferred to pay<br />\n$70 and to play the game in the rain before a crowd of three people.<br />\nWe believe that the members of the Athletic Association would be<br />\ninterested in a complete, financial statement of the expenditures for<br />\nthe year, which might be published in these columns and enable the<br />\nmembers to mold their own judgment on the question of economy<br />\n-in athletics.<br />\nThe Athletic Association has not lived up to the standard of<br />\nefficiency which was set up for it at the end of last year. It has<br />\nfailed to reach the great majority of its members; it has never attempted hi any discernible way to enforce the policy of intramural<br />\nathletics it announced last year. It is unresponsive to Public opinion. It does not get results commensurate with the amount of its<br />\nexpenditures, which incidentally approximated $5000 in the past year.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER believes that the Athletic Association has<br />\n\u2022<br />\nfailed to meet the emergency\u2014the extraordinary conditions of wartime. It believes that, for the duration of the war, the present athletic board and athletic system should be abolished, that we must<br />\neither adopt a more economical and efficient method or discontinue<br />\nintercollegiate athletics. We believe that we should retain intercollegiate athletics as long as they are part of an athletic system<br />\nwhich reaches every or almost every member of the student body;<br />\nbut that they should be discontinued, as a war measure, as soon<br />\nas they form the sole activity of the athletic organization. Intercollegiate athletics are an expensive luxury; as an end in themselves,<br />\nthey should be taboo in war-times\u2014as a means to the end of universal athletic participation, they may be worth their price.<br />\nBy way of suggestion of a new method, we might mention<br />\nBattalion management of athletics. The Battalion is the logical<br />\nmedium through which universal athletics may be fostered. In this<br />\nway, the conflicts between military training and ;team practises<br />\nmight be obliterated, and an efficient board of management might<br />\nbe found in the Battalion Staff of Instructors. This, however, is<br />\nonly a suggestion and should only be taken as such.<br />\nUnder whatever system athletics are organized, we believe that<br />\nthe members of the Athletic Association (if their status can be defined) should reserve the right at all times to ratify the appointment of all coo ches; the establishment of new offices, such as assistant graduate manager; and the annual budget.<br />\n<br />\n.3<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNSS -HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, MAY 13, 1918.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n1 NEWS OF MEN IN SERVICE 11<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LEITER wants to devote<br />\nthis page to news of Hopkins men in<br />\nthe service.

While in Alsace we worked two-day shifts at<br />\nvarious posts, when we had to<br />\nspeak French or act like a dummy.<br />\nAs little as I knew about French<br />\nI soon picked up the conversation,<br />\nand can now hold my own with<br />\n,anyone.

On one of my afternoons off duty, I walked to the<br />\nneighboring city where I visited<br />\nthe palace and gardens .of Napolion 1st. It is pitiful to see the<br />\ndamage done by shells, which frequently fly over us into this beautiful city. It is practically deserted, but a few ?of the more<br />\ndaring have , remained behind,<br />\nand continue to carry on their<br />\ndaily pursuits. They know that<br />\nthe city may be blown to pieces<br />\nany hour, but they refuse to move;<br />\nand live their former lives in spite<br />\nof everything.<br />\nDuring the day, the fighting is<br />\nmoderate, but at night, the guns<br />\nturn loose like hell itself; flashes<br />\nlight up the horizon, the earth<br />\ntrembles, and our poor home vibrates like these dinky engines.<br />\nAt first, sleeping was out of the<br />\nquestion, but we have become accustomed to the noise and jar of<br />\nthe guns and shells, and can sleep<br />\nthrough almost anything.

The attendance<br />\nwas large, especially on account<br />\nof the presence of a number of the<br />\nstudents from other colleges who<br />\nhad taken part in the track meet<br />\nand lacrosse game in the afternoon. .<br />\nThe C. E. Lecture Hall, in which<br />\nthe dance was held, was beautifully decorated. The lighting<br />\nbowls were lined with van -colored<br />\npaper, the walls were hung with<br />\nmany.banners of departed classes,<br />\nand the huge blackboard was camouflaged with the R. 0. T. C. national and battalion colors,<br />\ndraped over the service flag and<br />\nflanked with streamers.<br />\nThe music was lively enough for<br />\nthe fastest couples; the selections<br />\nwere well-chosen; and best of all,<br />\nthe number of encors was most<br />\nliberal. There was no rosin on<br />\nthe floor, either. The evening was<br />\nideal for sitting out dances on the<br />\noutside steps or promenading the<br />\nquadrangle; the cool breeze across<br />\nthe park and the future drill .<br />\ngrounds made one think of being<br />\non the steamer \"Louise.\" The<br />\nthirsty were made happy by the<br />\nalmost limitless supply of punch;<br />\nin the intermission the warm were<br />\ncooled with ice cream and the cool<br />\nwere warmed by coffee.

The game<br />\nresolved itself intO a pitchers'<br />\nbattle between Teddy Welliver of<br />\nHopkins and Kendrick of Catholic University, with Welliver having the best of it all the way<br />\nthrough. The young Hopkins'<br />\nmoundsman held his opponents to<br />\nfour scattered hits and sent<br />\neleven men back to the bench via<br />\nthe strike-out route. In two innings, the first and the third, he<br />\nfanned all three batters, while he<br />\nmade two of them whiff in the<br />\nseventh period. Kendrick, also<br />\nhad eleven strike-outs to his credit, but most of the third strikes<br />\nhe threw were called and many<br />\nof them were very close decisions.<br /><br />\nSo intense is the patriotic impulse of the men under 21 years of<br />\nage in the colleges of America to<br />\nget into war service that the War<br />\nDepartment in cooperation with<br />\nthe leading educators of the country has worked out a plan that<br />\nmay prove the first step toward a<br />\nsystem of voluntary military<br />\ntraining of universal application.<br />\nThe Secretary of War's announcement on the subject covers<br />\nfor the present only the colleges<br />\nand prescribes that military instruction under officers and noncommissioned officers of the United States Army be given in<br />\nevery institution of college grade<br />\nwhere 100 or more able-bodied students over the age of 18 may voluntary enroll for such instruction.<br />\nFrom all sides has come word to<br />\nWashington that men were leaving the colleges to enlist in the<br />\narmy, that the youngsters were<br />\nnot waiting for the draft and that<br />\nsuch depletion was seriously<br />\nthreatening the continued existence of many colleges. In order,<br />\ntherefore, to keep together the<br />\nmen of education from whom, of<br />\ncourse, future officers must be<br />\nmade, in order to give them a<br />\nstart in military service and at<br />\nthe same time enable the colleges<br />\nto continue with other branches<br />\nof the educational curriculum, the<br />\nnew plan has been evolved and<br />\nwill be put into operation in September next.<br />\nFor with a plethora of men for<br />\nthe army between the age of 21<br />\nand 31 and with the inevitable<br />\nloss on the battlefield of young<br />\nmen on whom time and money has<br />\nbeen spent for higher education, it<br />\nwould be shortsighted national<br />\npolicy to permit the breaking up<br />\nof any of the colleges.<br />\nThe idea of extending the plan<br />\nto secondary schools has been discussed but no conclusion has been<br />\nreached.

Coleman.<br /><br />\nA Hopkins Tradition Maintained.<br />\nLehigh came to Homewood last Saturday with confidence and the<br />\n,<br />\nlacrosse championship; Lehigh left Homewood about two hours later<br />\nwith neither joy nor the championship. The old Hopkins spirit<br />\nswelled up in the hearts of Captain Schmidt and his men and swept<br />\nthe ex-champions off their feet. The so-called weak attack of the<br />\nBlack and Blue crashed through the Lehigh defense three times before<br />\nthe game was fairly started. After the first minute of play, there<br />\nwas never any doubt that the old blue banner was going to adorn<br />\nthe walls of the Barn for many months to come. It was a brilliant,<br />\nglorious, clean-cut victory. It was an eloquent tribute to the coaching system of Hopkins lacrosse, to the loyalty and conscientious<br />\nefforts of every member of the team. Hopkins men\u2014in trench and<br />\ncamp, in France and the States\u2014will learn with real pride and<br />\nwhole-hearted satisfaction that the new Hopkins men have maintained an old cherished tradition.<br /><br />\nAn Appreciation.<br />\nWhen Major Guild was elected to the -Omicron Delta Kappa<br />\nCircle, it was clearly shown that besides having gained the hearty<br />\ncooperation of the faculty, he has won his way into the hearts of<br />\nthe students themselves. The Circle, which is the most particularly<br />\nrepresentative body in the University (for it is composed of men<br />\nwho have attained distinction in all branches of university activity)<br />\nhas expressed by its action the high esteem in which our commandant is held by the undergraduates.<br />\nThe faculty has long lent its support to all Major Guild's plans;<br />\nfor example, when the military recitations took precedence over all<br />\nother classes. The students, also,'have come to regard Major Guild\u2014<br />\nstrict disciplinarian as he is\u2014with the utmost admiration. He<br />\n.has given us a battalion of which we may well be proud, a battalion<br />\nwhich is most proficient in military science, and\u2014what is more\u2014a<br />\nbattalion with some spirit. Whatever efficiency and fame the Hopkins Battalion has attained this year is directly attributable to the<br />\nuntiring and unceasing efforts of Major Guild.<br /><br />\nRaisons d'Etre of Facts.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nIf there is any one single reason for the publication .of the series<br />\nof \"facts\" in these columns it is the additional fact that the athletic<br />\nauthorities at the University have never felt it necessary to explain<br />\nor defend these \"facts.\" The athletic management seems to feel<br />\nthat, after its mechanical and meaningless annual election, it is absolutely independent and irresponsible. We feel\u2014without the least<br />\npersonal embitterment and without the least claim of willful negligence\u2014that it is equally inefficient and unsatisfactory and unwilling<br />\nor unfit to adjust itself to the changed conditions of war-times.<br /><br />\nAt the outset, we beg to emphasize that the publication of \"facts\"<br />\nwas never aimed at any individual athletic authority, but at the<br />\nathletic system. We had no mysterious ulterior purpose. It was<br />\nour single object to give publicity to certain conditions and. circumstances which the authorities never saw fit to divulge to the<br />\nmere members.. We believe that through publicity alone can the<br />\ninterest and the sense of responsibility of all members of the Athletic<br />\nAssociation be aroused and sustained. We believe that it is quite<br />\nimpossible to approve or disapprove the measures and policies of<br />\nour representatives unless we know what they have done and what<br />\nthey are doing. It is by no means our purpose to detract in any<br />\nway from the splendid record of our recognized spring team; for<br />\nthem we have only unstinted praise.<br />\nFirst, we want to introduce some additional \"facts\" that have<br />\nrecently come to our attention. Two colleges of the thirteen that<br />\nare members, competed in the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Championships at Homewood last Saturday; one of the two was Hopkins.<br />\nIn his report to the President last fall, the Director of the<br />\nGymnasium said: \"It is our desire to get every man in the college<br />\ndepartment engaged in some sort of athletic activity, and, with that<br />\nend in view, the Athletic Association has engaged for next year the<br />\n* * to<br />\nservices of Mr. R. G. Murphy * * * He comes to us<br />\nfacilitate a thorough organization amongst the students for active<br />\nparticipation in sports, and to further the interest in all intramural<br />\nsport.\" Mr. Murphy enlisted in the army and was released from<br />\nthe contract. But the Athletic Association last August, presumably<br />\nwithout the knowledge of either board or sudent body, engaged the<br />\nservices of the football coach whose last service to Hopkins at that<br />\ntime might be expressed in the code form: 55 to 0.<br />\nIn the course of the past winter, it was announced that there<br />\nhad been. appointed and ratified an assistant graduate 1nanager.<br />\nThe reasons for and the constitutionality of the appointment were<br />\nnever discussed.<br />\nNow, we are perfectly aware of the Government's whole-hearted<br />\nendorsement of intercollegiate athletics during the war. But we<br />\nbelieve that the Government demands, at the same time, increased<br />\neconomy and efficiency in athletic management; which our own athletic authorities have entirely failed to recognize and enforce.<br />\nThe Athletic Association has not showed any reasonable tendency to economize. It has arranged long trips, conspicuous among<br />\nwhich are those to Providence and to West Point. It has not withdrawn.the annual appropriation of $75 to the tennis team when it<br />\nwas perfectly aware that there was no tennis team (we might call<br />\nit a tennis clique). It failed to recognize the opportunity to save<br />\n$35 by cancelling the Randolph-Macon game; it preferred to pay<br />\n$70 and to play the game in the rain before a crowd of three people.<br />\nWe believe that the members of the Athletic Association would be<br />\ninterested in a complete, financial statement of the expenditures for<br />\nthe year, which might be published in these columns and enable the<br />\nmembers to mold their own judgment on the question of economy<br />\n-in athletics.<br />\nThe Athletic Association has not lived up to the standard of<br />\nefficiency which was set up for it at the end of last year. It has<br />\nfailed to reach the great majority of its members; it has never attempted hi any discernible way to enforce the policy of intramural<br />\nathletics it announced last year. It is unresponsive to Public opinion. It does not get results commensurate with the amount of its<br />\nexpenditures, which incidentally approximated $5000 in the past year.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER believes that the Athletic Association has<br />\n\u2022<br />\nfailed to meet the emergency\u2014the extraordinary conditions of wartime. It believes that, for the duration of the war, the present athletic board and athletic system should be abolished, that we must<br />\neither adopt a more economical and efficient method or discontinue<br />\nintercollegiate athletics. We believe that we should retain intercollegiate athletics as long as they are part of an athletic system<br />\nwhich reaches every or almost every member of the student body;<br />\nbut that they should be discontinued, as a war measure, as soon<br />\nas they form the sole activity of the athletic organization. Intercollegiate athletics are an expensive luxury; as an end in themselves,<br />\nthey should be taboo in war-times\u2014as a means to the end of universal athletic participation, they may be worth their price.<br />\nBy way of suggestion of a new method, we might mention<br />\nBattalion management of athletics. The Battalion is the logical<br />\nmedium through which universal athletics may be fostered. In this<br />\nway, the conflicts between military training and ;team practises<br />\nmight be obliterated, and an efficient board of management might<br />\nbe found in the Battalion Staff of Instructors. This, however, is<br />\nonly a suggestion and should only be taken as such.<br />\nUnder whatever system athletics are organized, we believe that<br />\nthe members of the Athletic Association (if their status can be defined) should reserve the right at all times to ratify the appointment of all coo ches; the establishment of new offices, such as assistant graduate manager; and the annual budget.<br /><br />\n.3<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNSS -HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, MAY 13, 1918.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n1 NEWS OF MEN IN SERVICE 11<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LEITER wants to devote<br />\nthis page to news of Hopkins men in<br />\nthe service.

There was no rosin on<br />\nthe floor, either. The evening was<br />\nideal for sitting out dances on the<br />\noutside steps or promenading the<br />\nquadrangle; the cool breeze across<br />\nthe park and the future drill .<br />\ngrounds made one think of being<br />\non the steamer \"Louise.\" The<br />\nthirsty were made happy by the<br />\nalmost limitless supply of punch;<br />\nin the intermission the warm were<br />\ncooled with ice cream and the cool<br />\nwere warmed by coffee.
