Criticisms and<br />\naccusations were hurled at this paper,<br />\nwhich was charged with unfairness, with<br />\nbeing disrespectful and with not voicing<br />\nthe opinion of the campus.<br />\nWE denied those charges last May in<br />\nan editorial \"Standing Firm\". We deny<br />\nthem now before they can be made again.<br />\nWe challenge any member of the University to today give any basically sound and<br />\nunprejudiced cause for these charges, or<br />\nany other for that matter.

There is<br />\nno campus opinion at the Hopkins, so we<br />\nfeel that, as a newspaper, it is our duty<br />\nto do our part in crystallizing a positive<br />\nopinion at Homewood.<br />\nIT is our inalienable right to advance<br />\nwhatever frank views we have on whatever topic we desire, provided such opinions conform to ordinary canons of<br />\ndecency and propriety. We are determined<br />\nto mold campus opinion\u2014to set forth what<br />\nwe see best for the University's undergraduate department. It is to be understood that this paper refuses to heed the<br />\nintimidations of those who would rather<br />\nhave on the campus a paper with no<br />\nbackbone, with fear of saying what it will,<br />\nif its views are honest and truthful.

How the Hopkins<br />\npaper can dictate, we do not know. Our<br />\naim is not to dictate, but merely to present<br />\nour views on topics pertinent to the<br />\nwelfare of the University. It is up to us<br />\nto make every effort to have them accepted by both faculty and student body. If<br />\nthey are, then we have succeeded.<br />\nTHE right to criticise has never been<br />\ndenied any individual at Hopkins. But no<br />\none here, or elsewhere, has ever been<br />\ngiven the right to criticise unjustly, to<br />\naccuse, libel, or slander others on the<br />\nbasis of faulty, unfounded evidence. THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER has the inalienable right to<br />\nliberally voice its criticisms in language<br />\nwhich is respectful and which is not<br />\nviolent or insulting.

Volumes<br />\nplaced in the reserved book department here are to be signed for when<br />\ntaken either for reading in the room<br />\nor for home use.
