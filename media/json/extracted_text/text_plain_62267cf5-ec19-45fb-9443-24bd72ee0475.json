For two weeks preceding examinations.<br />\nformai instruction has been suspended at Harvard, and in its<br />\nplace, the students are supposed to do a certain amount of required reading, carefully planned in advance by the instructors.<br />\n\u2022 This scheme is, in reality, one of the best tests to which the<br />\n\u2022 so-called liberal education can be put. One of the greatest advantages claimed for the modern collegiate education is that it should<br />\ncreate in the mind of the student a certain amount of genuine<br />\ncuriosity and interest in cultural matters which would probably<br />\nlie dormant were it not for the stimulus which the years spent<br />\n\u2022 at college create. In other words, the real test of the college<br />\neducation is the effect on the Bachelor of Arts after he has left<br />\nthe environment of his college. If he has developed a taste for<br />\ngood literature, for example, which becomes an ineradicable part<br />\nof. his make-up, his education might be termed a success.<br />\nTherefore, to a smaller degree, of course, the efficacy of the<br />\n\"reading period\" is an index of the liberalizing effect of the liberal education. If students, left entirely on their own for three<br />\nweeks, will honestly go about the business of educating themselves, there is a justification for the collegiate education. If not,<br />\nthe liberal education is just as much an anomoly as so many of<br />\n\u2022 its. critics say it is.<br />\n<br />\nPleas<br />\nsitior<br />\nit tO<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nA WORD ABOUT SUPPORT<br />\n\u2022 Basketball, Hopkins' newly inaugurated sport, gets its first trial<br />\ntonight, and according to the opinion of many of those who are<br />\nin the inner circle of Hopkins athletics, its failure or success will<br />\nmark the failure or success of all minor sports. If the student<br />\nbody shows, by the interest it evinces in the team, that it thinks<br />\nbasketball a worth-while sport, the Athletic Council will probably<br />\naceept this manifestation of interest as an indication that the<br />\nstudent body approves and wants minor sports; if not, the Council may be led to believe that minor sports are not worth to the<br />\nstudent body as a whole the money spent on them.<br />\nOf course, in gauging the actual success of the team in winning games, it is necessary to keep in mind several facts. First<br />\nof all, the team is late in getting started. In the second place,<br />\nthe members are playing together for the first time. It is, therefore, hardly reasonable to expect victories in the majority of the<br />\ngames.

For two weeks preceding examinations.<br />\nformai instruction has been suspended at Harvard, and in its<br />\nplace, the students are supposed to do a certain amount of required reading, carefully planned in advance by the instructors.<br />\n\u2022 This scheme is, in reality, one of the best tests to which the<br />\n\u2022 so-called liberal education can be put. One of the greatest advantages claimed for the modern collegiate education is that it should<br />\ncreate in the mind of the student a certain amount of genuine<br />\ncuriosity and interest in cultural matters which would probably<br />\nlie dormant were it not for the stimulus which the years spent<br />\n\u2022 at college create. In other words, the real test of the college<br />\neducation is the effect on the Bachelor of Arts after he has left<br />\nthe environment of his college. If he has developed a taste for<br />\ngood literature, for example, which becomes an ineradicable part<br />\nof. his make-up, his education might be termed a success.<br />\nTherefore, to a smaller degree, of course, the efficacy of the<br />\n\"reading period\" is an index of the liberalizing effect of the liberal education. If students, left entirely on their own for three<br />\nweeks, will honestly go about the business of educating themselves, there is a justification for the collegiate education. If not,<br />\nthe liberal education is just as much an anomoly as so many of<br />\n\u2022 its. critics say it is.<br /><br />\nPleas<br />\nsitior<br />\nit tO<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nA WORD ABOUT SUPPORT<br />\n\u2022 Basketball, Hopkins' newly inaugurated sport, gets its first trial<br />\ntonight, and according to the opinion of many of those who are<br />\nin the inner circle of Hopkins athletics, its failure or success will<br />\nmark the failure or success of all minor sports. If the student<br />\nbody shows, by the interest it evinces in the team, that it thinks<br />\nbasketball a worth-while sport, the Athletic Council will probably<br />\naceept this manifestation of interest as an indication that the<br />\nstudent body approves and wants minor sports; if not, the Council may be led to believe that minor sports are not worth to the<br />\nstudent body as a whole the money spent on them.<br />\nOf course, in gauging the actual success of the team in winning games, it is necessary to keep in mind several facts. First<br />\nof all, the team is late in getting started. In the second place,<br />\nthe members are playing together for the first time. It is, therefore, hardly reasonable to expect victories in the majority of the<br />\ngames. The student body must take cognizance of these facts<br />\nin judging the team's excellence, and should not let its greenness<br />\nbe a detriment to the amount of support it receives.<br /><br />\nSitiOr<br /><br />\nPreSC<br /><br />\nthe<br />\nshow<br />\nand i<br /><br />\nON 1<br /><br />\nl'o t,<br /><br />\nni(<br /><br />\n, A]<br /><br />\n'on<br />\nPear<br /><br />\nA mountain oftelephone subscribers is<br />\nnot the goal \u2014 but<br />\nhow to give better<br />\nservice,<br /><br />\nWhat lies beyond<br />\nthe mountains?<br />\nOUNTAINS blocked the trail of<br />\nthe pioneers who opened up the<br />\nfar west.
