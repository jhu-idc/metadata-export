Kraushaar,<br />\nPresident of Goucher College, will be the principal<br />\nspeaker at this year's commencement exercises elicits<br />\nmixed reactions.<br />\nOn the one hand, it seems a long overdue gesture<br />\nto honor the distinguished philosopher and administrator whose fine work both at Goucher and in the<br />\nGreater Baltimore area extends back to 1948. The invitation also seems praiseworthy if by any stretch of the<br />\nimagination it may be construed as a portent of things<br />\nto come towards increased cooperation with the Towson<br />\nschool.<br />\nOn the other hand, one hopes that Hopkins is not<br />\nfalling into the unfortunate rut of inviting only college<br />\npresidents to address the graduates on their last day<br />\nat the school. Dr. Kraushaar will be the third university<br />\npresident to speak here at commencement in the last<br />\nfour years.<br />\nNot every graduation address can be as memorable<br />\nas the one at Harvard in 1947 when Secretary of State<br />\nMarshall announced what came to be known as the<br />\n\"Marshall Plan.\" Yet it is hoped that the speech on<br />\nwhich a student bows out as an undergraduate would<br />\nbe meaningful and significant to him.<br />\nIn the event that a \"big name\" such as Edward R.<br />\nMurrow, President Dwight Eisenhower, or Prime Minister Harold MacMillan can not be secured, it might<br />\nbe far more profitable to invite a prominent member of<br />\nthe Hopkins faculty to speak. His close observation of<br />\nthe personality and temperament of the Hopkins undergraduate would render his departing words more useful.<br />\nWe feel that on the whole the choice of Dr. Kraushaar is a good one and his speech will be worth attending.

Hopkins' great<br />\nmeasure of freedom and challenging academic environment presents great problems for incoming freshmen.<br />\nLack of restriction and necessary self-discipline are<br />\nmore difficult to handle at first but are great assets<br />\nwhich Hopkins offers. When someone leaves Homewood<br />\nafter four years, he knows how to fend for himself.<br />\nOrientation should try its level best to tell the<br />\nfreshman exactly what Hopkins is and what he should<br />\nexpect. He should be told that his dormitory social program is largely artificial and contrived and that a better<br />\nsocial life can be had off-campus. He should be told that<br />\nwe are not a rah-rah campus, don't go in for athletics<br />\nin a real big way, and have no equivalent to Princeton<br />\nriots. And finally, he should be told that a fine education<br />\nand pleasant four years can be found here but not in<br />\nthe ghoul booths.<br />\n<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\n\"Exit the honeys in lieu of<br />\nbeing convinced.\"<br />\nThis sentence appeared in an<br />\narticle entitled \"The Sad Cafe.\"<br />\nIt follows a statement to the<br />\neffect that \"we of the Hop do<br />\nnot feel superior.\"<br />\n<br />\nTruth<br />\n<br />\nI concur: especially when it To The Editor:<br />\ncomes to Latin conjugations!<br />\nI would add my vote to<br />\nthat of Mr. Kennedy's (\"Veritas<br />\nJ.

Kraushaar,<br />\nPresident of Goucher College, will be the principal<br />\nspeaker at this year's commencement exercises elicits<br />\nmixed reactions.<br />\nOn the one hand, it seems a long overdue gesture<br />\nto honor the distinguished philosopher and administrator whose fine work both at Goucher and in the<br />\nGreater Baltimore area extends back to 1948. The invitation also seems praiseworthy if by any stretch of the<br />\nimagination it may be construed as a portent of things<br />\nto come towards increased cooperation with the Towson<br />\nschool.<br />\nOn the other hand, one hopes that Hopkins is not<br />\nfalling into the unfortunate rut of inviting only college<br />\npresidents to address the graduates on their last day<br />\nat the school. Dr. Kraushaar will be the third university<br />\npresident to speak here at commencement in the last<br />\nfour years.<br />\nNot every graduation address can be as memorable<br />\nas the one at Harvard in 1947 when Secretary of State<br />\nMarshall announced what came to be known as the<br />\n\"Marshall Plan.\" Yet it is hoped that the speech on<br />\nwhich a student bows out as an undergraduate would<br />\nbe meaningful and significant to him.<br />\nIn the event that a \"big name\" such as Edward R.<br />\nMurrow, President Dwight Eisenhower, or Prime Minister Harold MacMillan can not be secured, it might<br />\nbe far more profitable to invite a prominent member of<br />\nthe Hopkins faculty to speak. His close observation of<br />\nthe personality and temperament of the Hopkins undergraduate would render his departing words more useful.<br />\nWe feel that on the whole the choice of Dr. Kraushaar is a good one and his speech will be worth attending. In the future, however, we recommend that the<br />\ncommencement speaker be chosen from among our renowned faculty, except in very rare cases.<br /><br />\nOrientation<br />\nOver the years, each succeeding orientation committee seems bent upon reaching new heights of efficiency and streamlining epitomized by organization<br />\nman, Jim McClaine. The philosophy in the past, if any<br />\nexisted, seems to have been that through a complicated<br />\nsystem of logistical manuevers, the freshmen emerge<br />\nafter one week with practical details handled and some<br />\nspirit of the Hop.<br />\nThe Administration is fond of the notion that if the<br />\nfreshmen could be wielded into some kind of cohesive<br />\nunit before upper class apathy trickles down,the texture<br />\nof the undergraduate body would eventually change.<br />\nLogical as it may sound, freshmen dormitories, which<br />\nwere partially motivated by this thought, have had the<br />\nopposite effect with a ten percent increase in fraternity<br />\npladging.<br />\nIt seems to us that orientation should not convince,<br />\nconvert, wield, or wangle but convey. Hopkins' great<br />\nmeasure of freedom and challenging academic environment presents great problems for incoming freshmen.<br />\nLack of restriction and necessary self-discipline are<br />\nmore difficult to handle at first but are great assets<br />\nwhich Hopkins offers. When someone leaves Homewood<br />\nafter four years, he knows how to fend for himself.<br />\nOrientation should try its level best to tell the<br />\nfreshman exactly what Hopkins is and what he should<br />\nexpect. He should be told that his dormitory social program is largely artificial and contrived and that a better<br />\nsocial life can be had off-campus. He should be told that<br />\nwe are not a rah-rah campus, don't go in for athletics<br />\nin a real big way, and have no equivalent to Princeton<br />\nriots. And finally, he should be told that a fine education<br />\nand pleasant four years can be found here but not in<br />\nthe ghoul booths.<br /><br />\nDear Sir:<br />\n\"Exit the honeys in lieu of<br />\nbeing convinced.\"<br />\nThis sentence appeared in an<br />\narticle entitled \"The Sad Cafe.\"<br />\nIt follows a statement to the<br />\neffect that \"we of the Hop do<br />\nnot feel superior.\"<br /><br />\nTruth<br /><br />\nI concur: especially when it To The Editor:<br />\ncomes to Latin conjugations!<br />\nI would add my vote to<br />\nthat of Mr. Kennedy's (\"Veritas<br />\nJ.
