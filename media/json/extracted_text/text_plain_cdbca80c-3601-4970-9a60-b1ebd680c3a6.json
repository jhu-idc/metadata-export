Rut from another standpoint it is a tribute<br />\nto the profoundness of his remarks that we should<br />\nfind so much room for amplification in a single gesture. The phase of his talk that most impressed us<br />\nwas his impatience with questioners who wanted to<br />\nknow what the pacifist will do if America is invaded.<br />\nHe pointed out that in every war in which she<br />\nhas participated since 1812, America has been the<br />\naggressor, no matter 'what her \"moral\" foundation,<br />\nand has not been subjected to invasion. He described<br />\nas \"remote\" the possibility that we ever will be invaded. And, directly, he said that organized refusal<br />\nto fight is the pacifist's only answer.<br />\nBut pressed further by another inquisitor, he<br />\nlost patience and interrupted to say that unless this<br />\ngeneration realizes that there is some intermediate<br />\nweapon \"between passive resistance and revolution as<br />\na means of acquiring peace, we will be doomed.\" He<br />\ncondemned hypothetizing as subversive to the immediate best interests of the pacifist cause.<br />\nHis flare-up, we believe, is attributable to the<br />\nnature of his own convictions. His impatience was<br />\nthat of a man who has gone as far as he can cautiously<br />\nand gropingly, and then leaped off into space. An<br />\nintolerance for the indecision of unconvinced youngsters is understandable in a man who has cut himself<br />\nirretrievably loose; who \"cannot keep house with himself and sanction war\"; who has committed himself<br />\nto the point where no amount of hypothesis could<br />\npossibly have any effect on his unalterable course.<br />\nThe temporizing, bickering, and fatuous applauding of the audience during Mr. Thomas's session<br />\naroused grave doubt as to the future of the pacifist<br />\ncause. Attention to the speaker was but casual, the<br />\nmajority of the preponderantly female audience being<br />\ndivided between silly old women who simpered,<br />\nclapped, and waved across the room indiscriminately,<br />\nand pseudo-intellectual girls who mostly lit murads<br />\nand gazed, enrapt, at the ceiling. The cool and calculated, yet impassioned oratory of one of the leading<br />\nspeakers in the country- seemed to stop short of im'pressing a gross and unimaginative group; his \"dynamic\" returned to him void.<br />\nSessions of that sort make us question whether<br />\nMr. Thomas is not alone, with but few consorts, as<br />\na prophet of a lost cause.<br />\n<br />\nWe're At It Again<br />\nIn our last issue we again directed the attention<br />\nof our readers to the grotesque lack of equilibrium in<br />\nthe organization of the faculty duties at the Hopkins.<br />\nWe again dragged out the figures to show that of<br />\ntwenty-three of the most prominent faculty members,<br />\nwho are also national and international figures, only<br />\ntwo may be reached by the undergraduate through<br />\nthe classroom. One of these professors requires that<br />\nonly the ten best men in the class be admitted to his<br />\ncourse each year.<br />\n<br />\nThe out-and-out exclusiveness of these men who<br />\nare the very mainstays of an institution founded as<br />\n'a partnership of students and professors dedicated<br />\nto the joint search for truth is an anomaly of no<br />\nsmall imbort. Because we have been impressed that<br />\nherein lies possibly one of the impediments to<br />\neven greater accomplishments by Hopkins men we<br />\nhave carefully and persistently kept it an open matter.<br />\nThe President of the University evinces a sympathy<br />\nfor our position but states that he must depend upon<br />\nthe professors to see the point themselves and to voluntarily abandon their cloisters. That such lack of<br />\ncooperation should exist in a partnership of foregoing<br />\ndescription is also impressive. It makes us wonder<br />\nif the University might not be compared to the<br />\nwhited sepulchre or hollow tree-trunk.<br />\nWithout any intention of being dramatic about<br />\nour impressions, however, we have solicited from a<br />\ncontributor himself, a member of the faculty, the<br />\narticle which appears on this page today under the<br />\nheading of \"Top-Heavy Hopkins\". We recommend<br />\nit to the thoughtful attention of the faculty and administration, in particular, and also to any students<br />\nwho might possibly be blessed with an idea concerning the situation.<br />\n<br />\nEditorial Extraordinary<br />\nEvery now and then we have to stop and bemoan<br />\nthe injustices which our modern age inflicts upon<br />\nthe righteous. Successive outrages have, brought us<br />\nto the breaking point. Time and again we've marvelled that Baltimore, the scion-city of a dying tradition of Southern beauty, should have treated us so<br />\nscurvily in the matter of contributing to our peace<br />\nof mind here on the campus. Look around you;<br />\nthere are only two girls of passing comeliness in the<br />\nwhole College for Teachers. And that in the midst<br />\nof men who are known for their fastidiousness and<br />\nconnoisseur accomplishments in the field of feminine<br />\npulchritude! A man loses caste by submitting to it.<br />\nOr take, for instance, the insolence of the freshmen. Entirely oblivious of their immemorial rhiniehood they treat us as their equals, beat us at craps,<br />\nand even presume to challenge us intellectually. No<br />\nman's date is inviolable before the onrush of their<br />\neternal cutting-in, and when, dazedly, we reach for<br />\nthat paddle and would roar for subservience, we find<br />\nourselves unmanned. The paddles, dinkies, rules are<br />\ngone, and we stand shorn of the respectability rightly<br />\ndue to worm-eaten antiques.<br />\nAnd only the other day another of the sacred<br />\nprecincts was desecrated. Old Ex-Cathedra Williamson himself, the last stronghold of convention and<br />\ndecorum, in whose breast the highborn principles of<br />\na decaying social order have dug in desperately and<br />\nabjectly, was subjected to the humiliation of having<br />\nsomeone cut in ahead of him in the cafeteria line.<br />\nNumb from the shock, he looked to see who it was<br />\nthat would presume to tear the idols from their niches.<br />\nThe revelation was too much.

I call him the friend of<br />\nyoung men because the appellation is perfectly true and because it has a present<br />\npathetic significance which inspires this<br />\narticle.<br />\nThere is nothing in the will of Johns<br />\nHopkins which can be wrenched into the<br />\nmeaning that he desired the undergraduate departments of his university neglected for the benefit of the higher<br />\nschools. And yet this is what is actually<br />\ntaking place, at least in one of the colleges at Homewood. I have contacts at<br />\nthe University which enable me to observe the undercurrents of change which<br />\nflow through that institution, to observe<br />\nthe attitude both of students and faculty;<br />\nand I cannot help feeling disheartened at<br />\nwhat is revealed to me.<br />\n<br />\nTHERE IS said to be little college<br />\nspirit at Hopkins. No one who is familiar with the campus will deny this accusation, least of all the students themselves. The explanation of this condition<br />\nis not far to seek. There is prevalent<br />\namong the undergraduates a feeling of<br />\nindifference which, in the case of the<br />\nkeener minds, mounts to indignation and<br />\nresentment, and which springs from the<br />\nattitude of patronage practised by most<br />\nof the faculty. With a few notable exceptions, these latter gentlemen consider<br />\nthat their undergraduate courses are<br />\nbread and butter affairs which are necessary as a means of commanding a salary,<br />\nbut are to be escaped from as soon as<br />\npossible so that attention can be paid to<br />\nthe graduate students. If a freshman enrolls in the College of Arts and Sciences,<br />\nhoping to come under the tutelage of a<br />\ngreat name, he will be disappointed, for<br />\nin almost every case the \"big\" men of the<br />\nfaculty have very little to do with classes<br />\nin the College of Arts and Sciences. Only<br />\na casual examination of the announcement issued for this college proves this<br />\nstatement. If a student desires the guidance of a Lovejoy, or a Hollander, or a<br />\nMalone, or a Chinard, or a Reed, he<br />\nmust indicate graduate leanings in his last<br />\nyears and then perhaps may be accepted<br />\nin the pro-graduate courses given by<br />\nthese men.<br />\nBUT THIS is by no means the worst<br />\nof the situation. Some of the instructors<br />\ninflicted upon the first-year man would<br />\nnot be tolerated in any other university<br />\nof a similar rank. Well-meaning though<br />\nhe may be, capable as he may demonstrate himself in his research, a graduate<br />\nstudent pursuing his work toward an<br />\nM.A. or a Ph.D. is not usually an efficient instructor. In most cases his mind<br />\nis on other things, pursuing, let us say,<br />\nthe third layer of allegory in the fifth<br />\nbook of The Faerie Queene; in far too<br />\nmany cases he lacks experience altogether<br />\nin teaching. And when is a good instructor more needed than by a bewildered freshman? He comes to a new environn*nt dazed by the difference of<br />\nthings, in most cases eager and willing,<br />\nthough dumb, and if ever he needs a<br />\nsympathetic, experienced hand to guide<br />\nhim into profitable channels of behavior<br />\nand thought, it is then. A most capable<br />\nand understanding registrar does all that<br />\nhe can. So do the various Deans. But<br />\ntheir time is limited. Obviously, five pr<br />\nsix men can not watch and guide eight<br />\nhundred through their period of Storm<br />\nand Stress!<br />\nSO THE undergraduates are assigned<br />\nto \"advisers\". Now, if John Smith is<br />\nlucky enough to get a Hubbard, a Miles,<br />\na Lancaster, or a Secrist, he is all set<br />\nfor better things; but if he gets a younger<br />\n<br />\nman or a disinterested older man who is<br />\nbored by the thought of youngsters\u2014and<br />\nthis does occur and not infreqbently\u2014<br />\nhe is all set in the other direction. There<br />\nare men on the faculty who realize this<br />\nsituation and do all that they can individually' to correct it. I know of three<br />\nof the older men,, connected with Hopkins through a long period of years,<br />\nwhose office doors are always open and<br />\nwho are never too busy to extend a helping and kindly hand. And I know of<br />\nother faculty members\u2014important personages, too, whose fame has been bruited<br />\nabroad\u2014who do not possess the cqmmon<br />\ncourtesy to ask a young man to sit down<br />\nwhen he ventures trembling into their<br />\nsacred grottoes. I confess to a righteous<br />\nindignation, which boiled over and left<br />\nme weak, when I passed through the hallowed halls of Gilman last week beneath<br />\nthe sacred portraits of Remsen and Osler<br />\nand heard, from the depths of a neighboring office, the what-the-hell-do-youwant tones which welcomed a diffident<br />\nfirst year student. Gruffness too often<br />\nseems a concomitant of greatness \u2014 at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\nPERHAPS this whole attitude took<br />\nits origin in The Goodnow Plan for<br />\nchanging Hopkins into a sort of junior<br />\ngraduate institution with no freshman and<br />\nsophomore years and with the emphasis<br />\nentirely upon research. Although this<br />\napparently has been abandoned, there are<br />\nleft-overs which fester in the sinews of<br />\nthe institution. Several vitally necessary<br />\nfreshman courses have been dropped, for<br />\ninstance, and others, no less important.<br />\nhang on to the curriculum by the \"skin<br />\nof their teeth.\" If a student comes to<br />\nHopkins without preparation in a modern<br />\nlanguage, he is compelled to take an elementary course in The College for<br />\nTeachers\u2014and pay for it in addition to<br />\nhis regular tuition; there are no beginning courses in languages in the College<br />\nof Arts and Sciences! And Freshman<br />\nEnglish Compoiition, a course vitally<br />\nfoundational to everything else which<br />\ncomes later, is slowly being suffocated<br />\nby this malevolent pressure upon everything not-graduate.<br />\nTHE DEAN of the College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences will admit to students who<br />\ncomplain, \"I know you are getting a<br />\ndirty deal, but the Administration can do<br />\nnothing about it\"; and President Ames<br />\n<br />\nH. G.<br />\n<br />\nIN<br />\n<br />\nhas enough trouble steering the boat<br />\nstraight, considering the attempts ofrecent agitators on the faculty itself to put<br />\nthe compass haywire. So what does the Pen<br />\nundergraduate do? If he is an average<br />\nman, he builds up an apathetic, what-do sit-all-mean attitude; if he is above the<br />\naverage, he kicks\u2014futilely and sometimes<br />\nbitterly\u2014hoping that he will make some<br />\nimpression on the Boulder Dam of Gil duateism so that a trickle of<br />\nand sympathy will come understa'ig through to<br />\nhim. When that happens, there may be<br />\ncollege spirit at Hopkins\u2014and there tray POU<br />\nbe a larger enrollment of scholarly, personable young men. There is an almost<br />\ntragic significance in the very large<br />\nnumber of such high-school graduates<br />\nwho leave town for their college edul sh<br />\ntion because Baltimore does not offer epivennet<br />\nteam<br />\nthem what they require.<br />\nTHERE ARE signs that a change is seaso<br />\ntaking place. The day is coming wheii<br />\nShall<br />\nthe freshman on the Hopkins campus will 42.243<br />\nno longer resent the high tuition he has<br />\nto pay, for he .will find as many attrac- the c<br />\ntions there as elsewhere. For instance,<br />\nthe whole undergraduate athletic systeni stroys<br />\nwill be improved. He will practise and<br />\nfor ti<br />\nhe will watch his teams play in a home<br />\ngymnasium, erected\u2014if Hopkins awakens Th<br />\nto the opportunity\u2014labor-free by the \"Pon<br />\nCWA. He will find also an encouraging the q<br />\natmosphere that will inspire him to do and 1<br />\nhis share, and a general feeling, to 34_29<br />\nwhich he will contribute, that the College of Arts and Sciences is just as important as The School of Higher Studies. Some of the progressive members of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees have stated that<br />\nthe future of the University rests upon Shed<br />\nthe undergraduate schools.<br />\nstiSlntk<br />\npe<br />\nieSnall\u00b0reeSttib1<br />\nh<br />\nI DO NOT intend this as a destructive<br />\nthe<br />\nti<br />\npersonal criticism.

A lone female grad student was plodding<br />\nher precarious way towards Levering quite impervious<br />\nto the impending danger, for just at that moment<br />\na car turned in the drive. With a casual look behind<br />\nher, she continued her way without a tremor, for<br />\nshe had already completed half her journey. But the<br />\ncar came faster than she expected and so she started<br />\nto trot.<br />\n(\"Either beat 'the car or he killed\", she must<br />\nhave thought.)

Rut from another standpoint it is a tribute<br />\nto the profoundness of his remarks that we should<br />\nfind so much room for amplification in a single gesture. The phase of his talk that most impressed us<br />\nwas his impatience with questioners who wanted to<br />\nknow what the pacifist will do if America is invaded.<br />\nHe pointed out that in every war in which she<br />\nhas participated since 1812, America has been the<br />\naggressor, no matter 'what her \"moral\" foundation,<br />\nand has not been subjected to invasion. He described<br />\nas \"remote\" the possibility that we ever will be invaded. And, directly, he said that organized refusal<br />\nto fight is the pacifist's only answer.<br />\nBut pressed further by another inquisitor, he<br />\nlost patience and interrupted to say that unless this<br />\ngeneration realizes that there is some intermediate<br />\nweapon \"between passive resistance and revolution as<br />\na means of acquiring peace, we will be doomed.\" He<br />\ncondemned hypothetizing as subversive to the immediate best interests of the pacifist cause.<br />\nHis flare-up, we believe, is attributable to the<br />\nnature of his own convictions. His impatience was<br />\nthat of a man who has gone as far as he can cautiously<br />\nand gropingly, and then leaped off into space. An<br />\nintolerance for the indecision of unconvinced youngsters is understandable in a man who has cut himself<br />\nirretrievably loose; who \"cannot keep house with himself and sanction war\"; who has committed himself<br />\nto the point where no amount of hypothesis could<br />\npossibly have any effect on his unalterable course.<br />\nThe temporizing, bickering, and fatuous applauding of the audience during Mr. Thomas's session<br />\naroused grave doubt as to the future of the pacifist<br />\ncause. Attention to the speaker was but casual, the<br />\nmajority of the preponderantly female audience being<br />\ndivided between silly old women who simpered,<br />\nclapped, and waved across the room indiscriminately,<br />\nand pseudo-intellectual girls who mostly lit murads<br />\nand gazed, enrapt, at the ceiling. The cool and calculated, yet impassioned oratory of one of the leading<br />\nspeakers in the country- seemed to stop short of im'pressing a gross and unimaginative group; his \"dynamic\" returned to him void.<br />\nSessions of that sort make us question whether<br />\nMr. Thomas is not alone, with but few consorts, as<br />\na prophet of a lost cause.<br /><br />\nWe're At It Again<br />\nIn our last issue we again directed the attention<br />\nof our readers to the grotesque lack of equilibrium in<br />\nthe organization of the faculty duties at the Hopkins.<br />\nWe again dragged out the figures to show that of<br />\ntwenty-three of the most prominent faculty members,<br />\nwho are also national and international figures, only<br />\ntwo may be reached by the undergraduate through<br />\nthe classroom. One of these professors requires that<br />\nonly the ten best men in the class be admitted to his<br />\ncourse each year.<br /><br />\nThe out-and-out exclusiveness of these men who<br />\nare the very mainstays of an institution founded as<br />\n'a partnership of students and professors dedicated<br />\nto the joint search for truth is an anomaly of no<br />\nsmall imbort. Because we have been impressed that<br />\nherein lies possibly one of the impediments to<br />\neven greater accomplishments by Hopkins men we<br />\nhave carefully and persistently kept it an open matter.<br />\nThe President of the University evinces a sympathy<br />\nfor our position but states that he must depend upon<br />\nthe professors to see the point themselves and to voluntarily abandon their cloisters. That such lack of<br />\ncooperation should exist in a partnership of foregoing<br />\ndescription is also impressive. It makes us wonder<br />\nif the University might not be compared to the<br />\nwhited sepulchre or hollow tree-trunk.<br />\nWithout any intention of being dramatic about<br />\nour impressions, however, we have solicited from a<br />\ncontributor himself, a member of the faculty, the<br />\narticle which appears on this page today under the<br />\nheading of \"Top-Heavy Hopkins\".

Successive outrages have, brought us<br />\nto the breaking point. Time and again we've marvelled that Baltimore, the scion-city of a dying tradition of Southern beauty, should have treated us so<br />\nscurvily in the matter of contributing to our peace<br />\nof mind here on the campus. Look around you;<br />\nthere are only two girls of passing comeliness in the<br />\nwhole College for Teachers. And that in the midst<br />\nof men who are known for their fastidiousness and<br />\nconnoisseur accomplishments in the field of feminine<br />\npulchritude! A man loses caste by submitting to it.<br />\nOr take, for instance, the insolence of the freshmen. Entirely oblivious of their immemorial rhiniehood they treat us as their equals, beat us at craps,<br />\nand even presume to challenge us intellectually. No<br />\nman's date is inviolable before the onrush of their<br />\neternal cutting-in, and when, dazedly, we reach for<br />\nthat paddle and would roar for subservience, we find<br />\nourselves unmanned.

I call him the friend of<br />\nyoung men because the appellation is perfectly true and because it has a present<br />\npathetic significance which inspires this<br />\narticle.<br />\nThere is nothing in the will of Johns<br />\nHopkins which can be wrenched into the<br />\nmeaning that he desired the undergraduate departments of his university neglected for the benefit of the higher<br />\nschools. And yet this is what is actually<br />\ntaking place, at least in one of the colleges at Homewood. I have contacts at<br />\nthe University which enable me to observe the undercurrents of change which<br />\nflow through that institution, to observe<br />\nthe attitude both of students and faculty;<br />\nand I cannot help feeling disheartened at<br />\nwhat is revealed to me.<br /><br />\nTHERE IS said to be little college<br />\nspirit at Hopkins. No one who is familiar with the campus will deny this accusation, least of all the students themselves. The explanation of this condition<br />\nis not far to seek. There is prevalent<br />\namong the undergraduates a feeling of<br />\nindifference which, in the case of the<br />\nkeener minds, mounts to indignation and<br />\nresentment, and which springs from the<br />\nattitude of patronage practised by most<br />\nof the faculty. With a few notable exceptions, these latter gentlemen consider<br />\nthat their undergraduate courses are<br />\nbread and butter affairs which are necessary as a means of commanding a salary,<br />\nbut are to be escaped from as soon as<br />\npossible so that attention can be paid to<br />\nthe graduate students. If a freshman enrolls in the College of Arts and Sciences,<br />\nhoping to come under the tutelage of a<br />\ngreat name, he will be disappointed, for<br />\nin almost every case the \"big\" men of the<br />\nfaculty have very little to do with classes<br />\nin the College of Arts and Sciences. Only<br />\na casual examination of the announcement issued for this college proves this<br />\nstatement. If a student desires the guidance of a Lovejoy, or a Hollander, or a<br />\nMalone, or a Chinard, or a Reed, he<br />\nmust indicate graduate leanings in his last<br />\nyears and then perhaps may be accepted<br />\nin the pro-graduate courses given by<br />\nthese men.<br />\nBUT THIS is by no means the worst<br />\nof the situation. Some of the instructors<br />\ninflicted upon the first-year man would<br />\nnot be tolerated in any other university<br />\nof a similar rank. Well-meaning though<br />\nhe may be, capable as he may demonstrate himself in his research, a graduate<br />\nstudent pursuing his work toward an<br />\nM.A. or a Ph.D. is not usually an efficient instructor. In most cases his mind<br />\nis on other things, pursuing, let us say,<br />\nthe third layer of allegory in the fifth<br />\nbook of The Faerie Queene; in far too<br />\nmany cases he lacks experience altogether<br />\nin teaching. And when is a good instructor more needed than by a bewildered freshman? He comes to a new environn*nt dazed by the difference of<br />\nthings, in most cases eager and willing,<br />\nthough dumb, and if ever he needs a<br />\nsympathetic, experienced hand to guide<br />\nhim into profitable channels of behavior<br />\nand thought, it is then. A most capable<br />\nand understanding registrar does all that<br />\nhe can. So do the various Deans. But<br />\ntheir time is limited. Obviously, five pr<br />\nsix men can not watch and guide eight<br />\nhundred through their period of Storm<br />\nand Stress!<br />\nSO THE undergraduates are assigned<br />\nto \"advisers\". Now, if John Smith is<br />\nlucky enough to get a Hubbard, a Miles,<br />\na Lancaster, or a Secrist, he is all set<br />\nfor better things; but if he gets a younger<br /><br />\nman or a disinterested older man who is<br />\nbored by the thought of youngsters\u2014and<br />\nthis does occur and not infreqbently\u2014<br />\nhe is all set in the other direction. There<br />\nare men on the faculty who realize this<br />\nsituation and do all that they can individually' to correct it. I know of three<br />\nof the older men,, connected with Hopkins through a long period of years,<br />\nwhose office doors are always open and<br />\nwho are never too busy to extend a helping and kindly hand. And I know of<br />\nother faculty members\u2014important personages, too, whose fame has been bruited<br />\nabroad\u2014who do not possess the cqmmon<br />\ncourtesy to ask a young man to sit down<br />\nwhen he ventures trembling into their<br />\nsacred grottoes. I confess to a righteous<br />\nindignation, which boiled over and left<br />\nme weak, when I passed through the hallowed halls of Gilman last week beneath<br />\nthe sacred portraits of Remsen and Osler<br />\nand heard, from the depths of a neighboring office, the what-the-hell-do-youwant tones which welcomed a diffident<br />\nfirst year student. Gruffness too often<br />\nseems a concomitant of greatness \u2014 at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nII<br /><br />\nPERHAPS this whole attitude took<br />\nits origin in The Goodnow Plan for<br />\nchanging Hopkins into a sort of junior<br />\ngraduate institution with no freshman and<br />\nsophomore years and with the emphasis<br />\nentirely upon research. Although this<br />\napparently has been abandoned, there are<br />\nleft-overs which fester in the sinews of<br />\nthe institution. Several vitally necessary<br />\nfreshman courses have been dropped, for<br />\ninstance, and others, no less important.<br />\nhang on to the curriculum by the \"skin<br />\nof their teeth.\" If a student comes to<br />\nHopkins without preparation in a modern<br />\nlanguage, he is compelled to take an elementary course in The College for<br />\nTeachers\u2014and pay for it in addition to<br />\nhis regular tuition; there are no beginning courses in languages in the College<br />\nof Arts and Sciences! And Freshman<br />\nEnglish Compoiition, a course vitally<br />\nfoundational to everything else which<br />\ncomes later, is slowly being suffocated<br />\nby this malevolent pressure upon everything not-graduate.<br />\nTHE DEAN of the College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences will admit to students who<br />\ncomplain, \"I know you are getting a<br />\ndirty deal, but the Administration can do<br />\nnothing about it\"; and President Ames<br /><br />\nH. G.<br /><br />\nIN<br /><br />\nhas enough trouble steering the boat<br />\nstraight, considering the attempts ofrecent agitators on the faculty itself to put<br />\nthe compass haywire. So what does the Pen<br />\nundergraduate do? If he is an average<br />\nman, he builds up an apathetic, what-do sit-all-mean attitude; if he is above the<br />\naverage, he kicks\u2014futilely and sometimes<br />\nbitterly\u2014hoping that he will make some<br />\nimpression on the Boulder Dam of Gil duateism so that a trickle of<br />\nand sympathy will come understa'ig through to<br />\nhim. When that happens, there may be<br />\ncollege spirit at Hopkins\u2014and there tray POU<br />\nbe a larger enrollment of scholarly, personable young men. There is an almost<br />\ntragic significance in the very large<br />\nnumber of such high-school graduates<br />\nwho leave town for their college edul sh<br />\ntion because Baltimore does not offer epivennet<br />\nteam<br />\nthem what they require.<br />\nTHERE ARE signs that a change is seaso<br />\ntaking place. The day is coming wheii<br />\nShall<br />\nthe freshman on the Hopkins campus will 42.243<br />\nno longer resent the high tuition he has<br />\nto pay, for he .will find as many attrac- the c<br />\ntions there as elsewhere. For instance,<br />\nthe whole undergraduate athletic systeni stroys<br />\nwill be improved. He will practise and<br />\nfor ti<br />\nhe will watch his teams play in a home<br />\ngymnasium, erected\u2014if Hopkins awakens Th<br />\nto the opportunity\u2014labor-free by the \"Pon<br />\nCWA. He will find also an encouraging the q<br />\natmosphere that will inspire him to do and 1<br />\nhis share, and a general feeling, to 34_29<br />\nwhich he will contribute, that the College of Arts and Sciences is just as important as The School of Higher Studies.
