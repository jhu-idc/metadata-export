Out of those who<br />\nwould have shared his viewpoint a still smaller number could have<br />\nhandled the situation in so graceful and straightforward a manner.<br />\nWe are very glad that the talk was made, for taking into<br />\naccount the long standing athletic relation, the proximity of the<br />\ntwo institutions, and the fact that Major Garey is President of<br />\nSt. John's, it would be most unfortunate for one or two incidents<br />\nto affect traditionally harmonious relations.

Last year we outplayed them from start to finish.<br />\nThe game day after tomorrow promises to be no exception. The<br />\nheavy Maryland team, with a wealth of reserve material, and a<br />\nhighly successful season including a 15-0 defeat of Yale to its<br />\ncredit, will find itself confronted with the will to win personified<br />\nin Van Orman's fighting eleven.<br />\nThe team is ready. Throughout the whole season they have<br />\nworked with the Maryland game in view. All that is needed is<br />\nthe whole souled backing of every student. Spirit inspired the<br />\nteam to change the St. John's game into a rout; and it can give LIF<br />\nvictory at the Stadium. The team will give its best; the rest is up<br />\nto us.

Out of those who<br />\nwould have shared his viewpoint a still smaller number could have<br />\nhandled the situation in so graceful and straightforward a manner.<br />\nWe are very glad that the talk was made, for taking into<br />\naccount the long standing athletic relation, the proximity of the<br />\ntwo institutions, and the fact that Major Garey is President of<br />\nSt. John's, it would be most unfortunate for one or two incidents<br />\nto affect traditionally harmonious relations.

Last year we outplayed them from start to finish.<br />\nThe game day after tomorrow promises to be no exception. The<br />\nheavy Maryland team, with a wealth of reserve material, and a<br />\nhighly successful season including a 15-0 defeat of Yale to its<br />\ncredit, will find itself confronted with the will to win personified<br />\nin Van Orman's fighting eleven.<br />\nThe team is ready. Throughout the whole season they have<br />\nworked with the Maryland game in view. All that is needed is<br />\nthe whole souled backing of every student. Spirit inspired the<br />\nteam to change the St. John's game into a rout; and it can give LIF<br />\nvictory at the Stadium. The team will give its best; the rest is up<br />\nto us.
