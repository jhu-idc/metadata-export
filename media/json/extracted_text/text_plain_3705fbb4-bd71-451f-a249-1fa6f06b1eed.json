I think there's more<br />\nimportant issues, like academics<br />\nand, housing, that students should<br />\nbe working to improve,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nBeginning in May, Lenardo<br />\nwill take over the leadership of<br />\nthe SC, a body which he pledges<br />\nwill be \"a watchdog over the<br />\nadministration and the<br />\ndepartments.\"<br />\n'`Any action of the<br />\nadministration or any aspect of<br />\nstudent life that adversely affects<br />\nthe student body becomes the<br />\nresponsibility of the SC to step in<br />\nand correct.,\" he asserted.<br />\nBesides mitigating existing<br />\nproblems, Lenardo stressed his<br />\nintent to push for innovations.<br />\n\"If we're sold on the idea of a<br />\ntruly liberal arts undergraduate<br />\nProgram, we need a coordinated<br />\ncreative arts program,\" Lenard()<br />\nsaid.<br />\nHe explained that he hopes to organize an art center, complete<br />\nWith materials, where interested<br />\nstudents can meet with Bud<br />\nLeake, art consultant fromthe<br />\nMaryland Institute of Art.<br />\nLenardo also revealed that he<br />\nwill suggest to the Council that a<br />\ncorrespondence be established<br />\nWith the decision-making bodies<br />\nof the Univeristy. \"I think the<br />\nCouncil should regularly<br />\ncommunicate with the Academic<br />\nCouncil and the Board of<br />\nTrustees the feelings of the<br />\nstudent body.\"<br />\nIn additionto these tangible<br />\ninnovations, the future president<br />\nalso envisions a more subtle<br />\nchange in the direction of the<br />\nCouncil.. The issues before the SC<br />\n<br />\nnow are a far cry from the topics<br />\nthe student board faced only half<br />\na decade ago.<br />\n\"The major problem that<br />\nHopkins faced four or five years<br />\nago was its reputation for having<br />\nno social life and keeping the<br />\nundergraduates second class<br />\ncitizens,\" Lenardo said. \"That<br />\nproblem has since been remedied<br />\nby the changes Muller made, the<br />\ninstitution of the Dean of<br />\nStudents Office, and the Student<br />\nCouncil's activities.\"<br />\nNow that the University has<br />\nupgraded its social life, Lenardo<br />\nterms the Council in a \"leveling<br />\noff period.' where it can<br />\nconcentrate on other areas as<br />\nwell.<br />\n\"So far the Social Committee<br />\nhas been active, but now we've<br />\nhit a plateau. The Academic<br />\nReports are sort of an omen<br />\ntoward more serious issues,\" Ile<br />\nstated. \"Only recently have the<br />\nSAC and the Housing Committee<br />\ncome into gear and even more<br />\nrecently has the SC started<br />\nlooking into academics, but now<br />\nthat we are in gear, we're going<br />\nfull throttle.\"<br />\nLenard() was optimistic that<br />\nthe Council can accomplish these<br />\ngoals by drawing on its support<br />\nof not only the student body,<br />\nbut the administration as well.<br />\nHe added that the relationship<br />\nbetween the Council and the<br />\nadministration can best be<br />\ndefined as a case where \"one<br />\nhand washes the other.\"<br />\nHe said he believes that the<br />\nUniversity has a favorable<br />\nimpression of the Council,<br />\nthrough events such as the Fair,<br />\nwhich is a service to the school.\"<br />\n\"We gain their respect by<br />\nbeing responsible, by responsibly<br />\nevaluating the academic<br />\nsituation.\"<br />\nRespect<br />\nIt is a respect which Lenardo<br />\nthinks will be maintained, \"as<br />\nlong as the SC is responsible to<br />\nthe students, whether the<br />\nadministration agrees with that<br />\nparticular viewpoint or not.\"<br />\nA part of this' respect stems<br />\nfrom the SC President's<br />\nrelationships with the<br />\nadministration, Lenardo<br />\ncontends. However, these<br />\n<br />\nrelationships are- developed<br />\nslowly and cannot be handed<br />\ndown from one president to his<br />\nsuccessor. Though Lenardo<br />\nconsiders his lines of<br />\ncommunications \"good\" now, he<br />\nestimates that they will progress<br />\nas the SC acts responsibly.<br />\n\"A lot of people see Andy as<br />\npresident and think he must<br />\nknow every official on campus,<br />\nbut he's had three years to .<br />\ndevelop them. It takes time to<br />\ndevelop good relations,\" he said. However, according to<br />\nLenardo, respect for the Student<br />\nCouncil was not always as<br />\nprevalent. \"Years ago, the SC was<br />\nill-regarded by the administration<br />\nbecause the students weren't<br />\nresponsible.\"<br />\nHe asserts that the present<br />\nconfidence in the SC is evident<br />\nfrom the administration's<br />\nimplementation of the SC<br />\nHousing Report's,<br />\nrecommendation that<br />\nprofessionals be employed in the<br />\nOff-Campus Housing Office and<br />\n<br />\nthe Total Fitness Institute of<br />\nCalifornia. The Institute is<br />\ndescribed by Skedgell as \"a<br />\nGod-centered Outward Bound,<br />\ndesigned to help people survive<br />\non the outside with the help of<br />\nuod.\"<br />\n\"The Way\" was originated by<br />\nDr. Wierwille, a minister from<br />\nOhio. At Hopkins, Skedgell has<br />\ninitiated prayer meetings<br />\nsponsored by \"The Way\" for<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. The meetings are<br />\nheld every morning at 8:30 am in<br />\nthe Vincent House dorm lounge.<br />\nIn addition a \"class\" has been<br />\nset up, \"Power for Abundant<br />\n<br />\nHowever, Lenardo explained<br />\nseveral significant differences<br />\nbetween himself and his<br />\npredecessors.<br />\n\"In the past the SC has not<br />\nreally welcomed general student<br />\nparticipation, either contributory<br />\nor in the real functioning of the<br />\nCouncil.\" The future president<br />\nstated that he hopes to encourage<br />\nmore students to become<br />\ninvolved in SC activities.<br />\nLenardo added that the<br />\nCouncil should pay closer<br />\nattention to the allocation of<br />\nstudent money and play a greater<br />\nrole in making sure the<br />\nUniversity is fair in allocating its<br />\nfunds.<br />\nLenardo expressed enthusiasm<br />\nfor his new role, revealing that he<br />\nwill spend his first few months in<br />\noffice studying the complaints<br />\nreceived about the Brown<br />\nInfirmary and planning on<br />\nrenovations in the aeronautics<br />\nbuilding, to include a food co-op,<br />\nan arts center and possibly a<br />\nbookstore.<br />\n<br />\nMaster debaters win hands down<br />\nThe Debate Council captured<br />\nthe Maryland state debate<br />\nchampionship last weekend at<br />\nthe annual tournament,<br />\nconducted this year at<br />\nCatonsville Community College.<br />\nHopkins swept the first three<br />\nteam places and the top three<br />\nindividual awards in the<br />\ncompeittion that pitted seven<br />\nMaryland College against one<br />\nanother in a series of debates.<br />\nThe topic debated was \"the<br />\ncurtailment of presidential<br />\npower.\u2014 Temas had to take both<br />\naffirmative and negative positions<br />\nin the different matches.<br />\nThe team of Ed Brokans and<br />\nEric Glitzenstein took first place.<br />\nBrokans and Glitzenstein also<br />\ngarnered the first and second<br />\nplace individual awards,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nThe second place state team<br />\nwas that of Pete Koenig and Joel<br />\nJacobson.

But I guess I've<br />\nreally been made conscious of<br />\nfollowing his lead because it's so<br />\ninescapable. He's been president<br />\nfor three years now so its<br />\ninevitable that people see me as<br />\nthe successor to Andy, not to<br />\nthe presidency.\"<br />\nAlthough he insists that he is<br />\nnot obliged to run the Council as<br />\nSavitz has done, he said he sees<br />\nsome need to preserve the<br />\ncontinuity. He revealed that, like<br />\nSavitz, he will continue to be an<br />\navid supporter of the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice and will maintain an<br />\naggressive, outspoken image, two<br />\nqualities which combined with<br />\nintelligence, he said are necessary<br />\nfor an effective SC President.<br />\n<br />\nLiving,\" which presently has an<br />\nenrollment of about ten.<br />\nSkedgell said that the aims of<br />\n\"The Way\" are \"to teach people<br />\nthe truth of God's word and<br />\napply it to their lives\" and \"to<br />\nmake the word of God move and<br />\nlive like in the first century.\"<br />\n\"The Way\" seeks to give<br />\n\"every person an opportunity to<br />\nhear God's word and a chance to<br />\nlove God and one's fellow man.\"<br />\nThe program's director has<br />\nbeen active in similar<br />\norganizations for the past four<br />\nyears.

His anticipation of<br />\na gap between .costs and attainable income, and his frank<br />\nexpression of a solution\u2014gradual personnel and program cutbacks\u2014demonstrate the vision and perspicacity that have<br />\ncharacterized his tenure here.<br />\nMuller's presentation was refreshing and at the same time<br />\nsobering. His formal reassertion of the purpose of Hopkins<br />\nand other universities\u2014\"the betterment of the human condition\"\u2014was highly appropriate at a time when money has become the preoccupation of higher education, as well as society in general. Muller told the faculty: \"Our scholarly mission<br />\nentitles us to regard housekeeping as a necessary evil. As is<br />\nthe case today we cannot altogether avoid it, but God forbid<br />\nthat it should become our major preoccupation. That, and<br />\nthat alone, not a shortage of funds, would be disaster.<br />\nAnd yet, the implication of Muller's address was that<br />\ngradually, the size of the faculty ,and the number of programs<br />\nwill have to be reduced.<br />\nIt is now up to the faculty to effect changes that will<br />\ninsure the long-term viability of the University before drastic<br />\ncuts, etc. become necessary. The faculty, known to gripe<br />\nmore than occasionally about the inefficiency and ineptitude<br />\nof the \"administration,\" now have the chance to help mold<br />\nthe University the way they want it. Our only reservation<br />\nabout Muller's proposal is that he does not make it clear<br />\nwhere students fit in the process. Students must be consulted<br />\nas to what programs are needed, because they, in their academic naivete, can .provide insights and direction that the<br />\nfaculty can not. Not only must the research here be of high<br />\nquality, but the teaching must be as well. We are confident<br />\nthat the faculty and the administration, in keeping with Muller's spirit of \"working together,\" will not forget this when<br />\nthey begin their reevaluation of programs here.<br />\n<br />\nAn alternative to profit and professionalization?<br />\nBy DAVID PORTER<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University is<br />\nuniversally respected for the<br />\nexcellence of' its Medical<br />\nInstitutions and the quality of the<br />\npreparation for Medical School<br />\nafforded on the Homewood<br />\nCampus.

I consider the<br />\nmembers of the Fair Board to be<br />\nanyone who gave of their time and<br />\nenergy to make the Fair a success.<br />\nThis includes those who worked at<br />\nthe information table, the<br />\namusement<br />\nbooths, traffic<br />\ndirection, and clean-up. Perhaps<br />\nthis is stretching the definition a<br />\nbit, but I feel anyone who shows<br />\nan interest in 3400 on Stage should<br />\nbe considered a viable member of<br />\nthe steering committee. The thing<br />\nthat I found most irritating and<br />\ndisappointing about the work on<br />\nthe Fair was that, after watching<br />\nthe Fair Committee work for at<br />\nleast three months to bring the<br />\nHopkins community a good time,<br />\nno one would volunteer an hour of<br />\ntheir time to help out .the<br />\nmechanics of things. Negative<br />\nresponses are very disheartening.<br />\nand I, for one, was starting to<br />\nwonder last week if the Fair was<br />\ngoing to be a fiasco due to such<br />\napathy. People told me that I<br />\nchose to bring this extra amount of<br />\nwork on myself by volunteering to<br />\nhelp with the Fair.(No one forced<br />\nme to work on the Fair, but no<br />\none forced the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body to conic to the Fair.)<br />\nThis attitude is not exclusive to<br />\nwould-be Fair workers, but is one<br />\nthat I have encountered in various<br />\nactivities over the last few months.<br />\nI have also heard the repeated<br />\ncomplaint that \"ten people in this<br />\n<br />\nward patient( this is the wrong.<br />\nway to do a rectal<br />\n<br />\n- II<br />\n<br />\nthree times as much on advertising<br />\nas it does on research (The<br />\nAmerican Health Empire by B.

But all this is a bit off the<br />\nsubject of this letter. I think it<br />\nshould be mentioned that Phi Gam<br />\ndid get paid for their work during<br />\nthe weekend. But had Phi Gam not<br />\ncontracted for this job, and then<br />\nworked long, hard hours for<br />\nclean-up, the administrative edict<br />\non Monday morning would have<br />\nbeen a phasing-out of 3400 on<br />\nStage.<br />\nApril Moreno<br />\n<br />\nNever do<br />\ninitiated several programs related<br />\nC3CCIP11.<br />\n<br />\nto public health and community<br />\ninvolvement in health care<br />\n<br />\nproblems.

Inner city _blacks<br />\nhave twice the risk of high blood<br />\npressure of their white<br />\ncounterparts, and MCHR has<br />\nprinted and distributed a six-page<br />\ninformational leaflet on<br />\nhypertension in the East Baltimore<br />\narea.

Larry Santoro ripped a<br />\nsingle to left, with one man down<br />\nand Jim Duffy belted a double to<br />\n<br />\ndeep right to bring in the first of<br />\nthree runs that inning. After<br />\nFrank Olszewski layed down a<br />\nperfect drag bunt for a single and<br />\nDuffy scored on a balk, Tom<br />\nPedroni hit a two-bagger to<br />\nleft-center, the first of his three<br />\nhits, driving in Olszewski, to give<br />\nthe Blue Jays a 4-1 lead.<br />\nHopkins added another marker<br />\nin the third as Dave Emala<br />\nwalked, stole second and moved<br />\nhome on a double error.<br />\nThe Blue Jays knocked out<br />\nDickinson's starter in the fifth as<br />\nPedroni and Lou Podrazik put<br />\ntogether back to back Texas<br />\nleague singles and Emala<br />\nfollowed with a blast to left field<br />\ncorner for a double and two<br />\nRBI's.<br />\nAll the while, Burlington was<br />\nallowing few Dickinson<br />\nbaserunners and the Jays were<br />\nmaking fine defensive plays. In<br />\nparticular, Larry Santoro made a<br />\nspectacular catch against the<br />\nright field fence on a drive that<br />\nlooked to be certain extra bases.<br />\nSantoro's fine plays throughout<br />\n<br />\nJV lacrosse team<br />\nrouts Wroxeter, 10-2<br />\nThe Baby Blue Jays lacrosse<br />\nteam surprised Wroxeter High<br />\nSchool (and perhaps itself) last<br />\nTuesday as it routed Wroxeter<br />\n10-2: shutting them out for three<br />\nstraight quarters. With one game<br />\nleft, the JV's record now stands<br />\nat 7- 1 .<br />\nTouting one of the toughest<br />\nhigh school attack units in the<br />\ncountry, with at least one<br />\nall-American attackman,<br />\nWroxeter was indeed a potent<br />\nfoe. In the first quarter, they<br />\nplayed Hopkins even, scoring<br />\ntwice. Both came on Dan Lamon<br />\nfeeds to Coleman Wilson.<br />\nHopkins maintained a three point<br />\nadvantage, however, with Doober<br />\nAburn scoring the first two<br />\nunassisted and Carl Yeich making<br />\nup the difference late in the<br />\nperiod on a feed from Joe Devlin.<br />\nThe second quarter remained<br />\nfairly even. Though full of<br />\nbroken clears (most of them<br />\nHopkins') and unsettled<br />\nsituations, both teams' defenses<br />\nplayed well as no goals were<br />\nposted by either team.<br />\nThe third quarter was the real<br />\ntest for both teams. Although the<br />\nBaby Jays held a one-point lead,<br />\nWroxeter had the type of team<br />\nwhich could easily stage a<br />\ncomeback. To win, Hopkins had<br />\nto keep them from building any<br />\nkind of scoring momentum.<br />\nThat took them less than a<br />\nminute to do. With 23 seconds<br />\nelapsed, Doober Aburn took a<br />\nflip-off from Joe Devlin and<br />\nbounced the ball past Wroxeter's<br />\ngoalie to put Hopkins ahead 4-2.<br />\nAlthough they staged several<br />\ndrives throughout the rest of the<br />\nquarter, Wroxeter was unable to<br />\nconvert on any of them. The<br />\nBaby Jays, for their part,<br />\nwidened their lead to 6-2 on<br />\nunassisted goals by P.J. Boyle<br />\nand Chuck \"Chuckles\" Clarvit.<br />\nOnce the fourth quarter began,<br />\nit became apparent that the Baby<br />\nJays owned the game. Totally<br />\nrattled by Hopkins, Wroxeter<br />\n<br />\ncould barely keep from throwing<br />\nthe ball out of bounds. The Baby<br />\nJays sealed the Mustangs fate in<br />\nthe middle of the quarter scoring<br />\nfour quick goals, including one<br />\nby Doober Aburn, his fourth.<br />\nParticuarly impressive was the<br />\nBaby Jays extra-man defense.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins' clobbered the<br />\n2 minutes worth<br />\n/<br />\nMustangs with 91<br />\nof penalties (over 3/4 of a<br />\nquarter), Wroxeter could not<br />\nconvert any of them. Kudos go<br />\nto Ron Hall, Bernie Eisel, and<br />\nJim \"Ref\" Condon for their<br />\ndefensive assist in this effort.<br />\nThe Baby Jays wind up their<br />\nseason today when they take on<br />\nthe Navy JV Squids at Navy at<br />\n3:00. Lee-dee!<br />\nIn other sports action, the<br />\nJHU women's lacrosse team (you<br />\nthought the JV was obscure?)<br />\nmakes its big time debut a week<br />\nfrom tomorrow.<br />\n<br />\nthe game prompted Coach Cox<br />\nto comment, \"Santoro made the<br />\nbest outfield plays I've seen at<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nEven when Dickinson was able<br />\nto chip off a run against<br />\nBurlington, the Blue Jays came<br />\nright back to score in their half<br />\nof the inning.

This left the Jays with a 9-3<br />\nwin, their seventh this season.<br />\nCoach Cox felt that the win<br />\nwas an indication of the good<br />\nball his team could play,<br />\nespecially after stringing together<br />\n<br />\nNEws4ErrER<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\n<br />\nTrack team to contend in MACs<br />\nThe team then travelled to<br />\nBy BRUCE FOX<br />\nThis weekend, the Hopkins Pennsylvania where it took<br />\ntrack team is at Dickinson second in a triangular meet with<br />\nCollege to participate in the Gettysburg and Albright.

Double winners to 4-1.<br />\nwere Oscar Schreiber in the<br />\nTough<br />\n440-yard run and long jump, and<br />\nThe Blue Jays then went to<br />\nMark McConnell in the 120 high<br />\nwhere they defeated<br />\nHis<br />\nUrsinus<br />\njump.<br />\nhurdles and the high<br />\nDickinson but lost to a tough<br />\n4 set a new JHU<br />\n/<br />\nleap of 6-21<br />\nUrsinus team.

I was<br />\ndissatisfied with the way things<br />\nwere going.

The issues before the SC<br /><br />\nnow are a far cry from the topics<br />\nthe student board faced only half<br />\na decade ago.<br />\n\"The major problem that<br />\nHopkins faced four or five years<br />\nago was its reputation for having<br />\nno social life and keeping the<br />\nundergraduates second class<br />\ncitizens,\" Lenardo said. \"That<br />\nproblem has since been remedied<br />\nby the changes Muller made, the<br />\ninstitution of the Dean of<br />\nStudents Office, and the Student<br />\nCouncil's activities.\"<br />\nNow that the University has<br />\nupgraded its social life, Lenardo<br />\nterms the Council in a \"leveling<br />\noff period.' where it can<br />\nconcentrate on other areas as<br />\nwell.<br />\n\"So far the Social Committee<br />\nhas been active, but now we've<br />\nhit a plateau. The Academic<br />\nReports are sort of an omen<br />\ntoward more serious issues,\" Ile<br />\nstated. \"Only recently have the<br />\nSAC and the Housing Committee<br />\ncome into gear and even more<br />\nrecently has the SC started<br />\nlooking into academics, but now<br />\nthat we are in gear, we're going<br />\nfull throttle.\"<br />\nLenard() was optimistic that<br />\nthe Council can accomplish these<br />\ngoals by drawing on its support<br />\nof not only the student body,<br />\nbut the administration as well.<br />\nHe added that the relationship<br />\nbetween the Council and the<br />\nadministration can best be<br />\ndefined as a case where \"one<br />\nhand washes the other.\"<br />\nHe said he believes that the<br />\nUniversity has a favorable<br />\nimpression of the Council,<br />\nthrough events such as the Fair,<br />\nwhich is a service to the school.\"<br />\n\"We gain their respect by<br />\nbeing responsible, by responsibly<br />\nevaluating the academic<br />\nsituation.\"<br />\nRespect<br />\nIt is a respect which Lenardo<br />\nthinks will be maintained, \"as<br />\nlong as the SC is responsible to<br />\nthe students, whether the<br />\nadministration agrees with that<br />\nparticular viewpoint or not.\"<br />\nA part of this' respect stems<br />\nfrom the SC President's<br />\nrelationships with the<br />\nadministration, Lenardo<br />\ncontends. However, these<br /><br />\nrelationships are- developed<br />\nslowly and cannot be handed<br />\ndown from one president to his<br />\nsuccessor. Though Lenardo<br />\nconsiders his lines of<br />\ncommunications \"good\" now, he<br />\nestimates that they will progress<br />\nas the SC acts responsibly.<br />\n\"A lot of people see Andy as<br />\npresident and think he must<br />\nknow every official on campus,<br />\nbut he's had three years to .<br />\ndevelop them. It takes time to<br />\ndevelop good relations,\" he said. However, according to<br />\nLenardo, respect for the Student<br />\nCouncil was not always as<br />\nprevalent. \"Years ago, the SC was<br />\nill-regarded by the administration<br />\nbecause the students weren't<br />\nresponsible.\"<br />\nHe asserts that the present<br />\nconfidence in the SC is evident<br />\nfrom the administration's<br />\nimplementation of the SC<br />\nHousing Report's,<br />\nrecommendation that<br />\nprofessionals be employed in the<br />\nOff-Campus Housing Office and<br /><br />\nthe Total Fitness Institute of<br />\nCalifornia. The Institute is<br />\ndescribed by Skedgell as \"a<br />\nGod-centered Outward Bound,<br />\ndesigned to help people survive<br />\non the outside with the help of<br />\nuod.\"<br />\n\"The Way\" was originated by<br />\nDr. Wierwille, a minister from<br />\nOhio. At Hopkins, Skedgell has<br />\ninitiated prayer meetings<br />\nsponsored by \"The Way\" for<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. The meetings are<br />\nheld every morning at 8:30 am in<br />\nthe Vincent House dorm lounge.<br />\nIn addition a \"class\" has been<br />\nset up, \"Power for Abundant<br /><br />\nHowever, Lenardo explained<br />\nseveral significant differences<br />\nbetween himself and his<br />\npredecessors.<br />\n\"In the past the SC has not<br />\nreally welcomed general student<br />\nparticipation, either contributory<br />\nor in the real functioning of the<br />\nCouncil.\" The future president<br />\nstated that he hopes to encourage<br />\nmore students to become<br />\ninvolved in SC activities.<br />\nLenardo added that the<br />\nCouncil should pay closer<br />\nattention to the allocation of<br />\nstudent money and play a greater<br />\nrole in making sure the<br />\nUniversity is fair in allocating its<br />\nfunds.<br />\nLenardo expressed enthusiasm<br />\nfor his new role, revealing that he<br />\nwill spend his first few months in<br />\noffice studying the complaints<br />\nreceived about the Brown<br />\nInfirmary and planning on<br />\nrenovations in the aeronautics<br />\nbuilding, to include a food co-op,<br />\nan arts center and possibly a<br />\nbookstore.<br /><br />\nMaster debaters win hands down<br />\nThe Debate Council captured<br />\nthe Maryland state debate<br />\nchampionship last weekend at<br />\nthe annual tournament,<br />\nconducted this year at<br />\nCatonsville Community College.<br />\nHopkins swept the first three<br />\nteam places and the top three<br />\nindividual awards in the<br />\ncompeittion that pitted seven<br />\nMaryland College against one<br />\nanother in a series of debates.<br />\nThe topic debated was \"the<br />\ncurtailment of presidential<br />\npower.\u2014 Temas had to take both<br />\naffirmative and negative positions<br />\nin the different matches.<br />\nThe team of Ed Brokans and<br />\nEric Glitzenstein took first place.<br />\nBrokans and Glitzenstein also<br />\ngarnered the first and second<br />\nplace individual awards,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nThe second place state team<br />\nwas that of Pete Koenig and Joel<br />\nJacobson.

He revealed that, like<br />\nSavitz, he will continue to be an<br />\navid supporter of the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice and will maintain an<br />\naggressive, outspoken image, two<br />\nqualities which combined with<br />\nintelligence, he said are necessary<br />\nfor an effective SC President.<br /><br />\nLiving,\" which presently has an<br />\nenrollment of about ten.<br />\nSkedgell said that the aims of<br />\n\"The Way\" are \"to teach people<br />\nthe truth of God's word and<br />\napply it to their lives\" and \"to<br />\nmake the word of God move and<br />\nlive like in the first century.\"<br />\n\"The Way\" seeks to give<br />\n\"every person an opportunity to<br />\nhear God's word and a chance to<br />\nlove God and one's fellow man.\"<br />\nThe program's director has<br />\nbeen active in similar<br />\norganizations for the past four<br />\nyears.

SOlfrklay, may 2, 1975Ibaltimore, maryland179th year<br /><br />\nvision<br />\nPresident Muller's remarks on the University's economic<br />\nfuture\u2014delivered yesterday at a full meeting of the faculty-show remarkable presence and perception. His anticipation of<br />\na gap between .costs and attainable income, and his frank<br />\nexpression of a solution\u2014gradual personnel and program cutbacks\u2014demonstrate the vision and perspicacity that have<br />\ncharacterized his tenure here.<br />\nMuller's presentation was refreshing and at the same time<br />\nsobering. His formal reassertion of the purpose of Hopkins<br />\nand other universities\u2014\"the betterment of the human condition\"\u2014was highly appropriate at a time when money has become the preoccupation of higher education, as well as society in general. Muller told the faculty: \"Our scholarly mission<br />\nentitles us to regard housekeeping as a necessary evil. As is<br />\nthe case today we cannot altogether avoid it, but God forbid<br />\nthat it should become our major preoccupation. That, and<br />\nthat alone, not a shortage of funds, would be disaster.<br />\nAnd yet, the implication of Muller's address was that<br />\ngradually, the size of the faculty ,and the number of programs<br />\nwill have to be reduced.<br />\nIt is now up to the faculty to effect changes that will<br />\ninsure the long-term viability of the University before drastic<br />\ncuts, etc. become necessary. The faculty, known to gripe<br />\nmore than occasionally about the inefficiency and ineptitude<br />\nof the \"administration,\" now have the chance to help mold<br />\nthe University the way they want it. Our only reservation<br />\nabout Muller's proposal is that he does not make it clear<br />\nwhere students fit in the process. Students must be consulted<br />\nas to what programs are needed, because they, in their academic naivete, can .provide insights and direction that the<br />\nfaculty can not. Not only must the research here be of high<br />\nquality, but the teaching must be as well. We are confident<br />\nthat the faculty and the administration, in keeping with Muller's spirit of \"working together,\" will not forget this when<br />\nthey begin their reevaluation of programs here.<br /><br />\nAn alternative to profit and professionalization?<br />\nBy DAVID PORTER<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University is<br />\nuniversally respected for the<br />\nexcellence of' its Medical<br />\nInstitutions and the quality of the<br />\npreparation for Medical School<br />\nafforded on the Homewood<br />\nCampus.

I consider the<br />\nmembers of the Fair Board to be<br />\nanyone who gave of their time and<br />\nenergy to make the Fair a success.<br />\nThis includes those who worked at<br />\nthe information table, the<br />\namusement<br />\nbooths, traffic<br />\ndirection, and clean-up. Perhaps<br />\nthis is stretching the definition a<br />\nbit, but I feel anyone who shows<br />\nan interest in 3400 on Stage should<br />\nbe considered a viable member of<br />\nthe steering committee. The thing<br />\nthat I found most irritating and<br />\ndisappointing about the work on<br />\nthe Fair was that, after watching<br />\nthe Fair Committee work for at<br />\nleast three months to bring the<br />\nHopkins community a good time,<br />\nno one would volunteer an hour of<br />\ntheir time to help out .the<br />\nmechanics of things. Negative<br />\nresponses are very disheartening.<br />\nand I, for one, was starting to<br />\nwonder last week if the Fair was<br />\ngoing to be a fiasco due to such<br />\napathy. People told me that I<br />\nchose to bring this extra amount of<br />\nwork on myself by volunteering to<br />\nhelp with the Fair.(No one forced<br />\nme to work on the Fair, but no<br />\none forced the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body to conic to the Fair.)<br />\nThis attitude is not exclusive to<br />\nwould-be Fair workers, but is one<br />\nthat I have encountered in various<br />\nactivities over the last few months.<br />\nI have also heard the repeated<br />\ncomplaint that \"ten people in this<br /><br />\nward patient( this is the wrong.<br />\nway to do a rectal<br /><br />\n- II<br /><br />\nthree times as much on advertising<br />\nas it does on research (The<br />\nAmerican Health Empire by B.

But all this is a bit off the<br />\nsubject of this letter. I think it<br />\nshould be mentioned that Phi Gam<br />\ndid get paid for their work during<br />\nthe weekend. But had Phi Gam not<br />\ncontracted for this job, and then<br />\nworked long, hard hours for<br />\nclean-up, the administrative edict<br />\non Monday morning would have<br />\nbeen a phasing-out of 3400 on<br />\nStage.<br />\nApril Moreno<br /><br />\nNever do<br />\ninitiated several programs related<br />\nC3CCIP11.<br /><br />\nto public health and community<br />\ninvolvement in health care<br /><br />\nproblems.

Inner city _blacks<br />\nhave twice the risk of high blood<br />\npressure of their white<br />\ncounterparts, and MCHR has<br />\nprinted and distributed a six-page<br />\ninformational leaflet on<br />\nhypertension in the East Baltimore<br />\narea.

Larry Santoro ripped a<br />\nsingle to left, with one man down<br />\nand Jim Duffy belted a double to<br /><br />\ndeep right to bring in the first of<br />\nthree runs that inning. After<br />\nFrank Olszewski layed down a<br />\nperfect drag bunt for a single and<br />\nDuffy scored on a balk, Tom<br />\nPedroni hit a two-bagger to<br />\nleft-center, the first of his three<br />\nhits, driving in Olszewski, to give<br />\nthe Blue Jays a 4-1 lead.<br />\nHopkins added another marker<br />\nin the third as Dave Emala<br />\nwalked, stole second and moved<br />\nhome on a double error.<br />\nThe Blue Jays knocked out<br />\nDickinson's starter in the fifth as<br />\nPedroni and Lou Podrazik put<br />\ntogether back to back Texas<br />\nleague singles and Emala<br />\nfollowed with a blast to left field<br />\ncorner for a double and two<br />\nRBI's.<br />\nAll the while, Burlington was<br />\nallowing few Dickinson<br />\nbaserunners and the Jays were<br />\nmaking fine defensive plays. In<br />\nparticular, Larry Santoro made a<br />\nspectacular catch against the<br />\nright field fence on a drive that<br />\nlooked to be certain extra bases.<br />\nSantoro's fine plays throughout<br /><br />\nJV lacrosse team<br />\nrouts Wroxeter, 10-2<br />\nThe Baby Blue Jays lacrosse<br />\nteam surprised Wroxeter High<br />\nSchool (and perhaps itself) last<br />\nTuesday as it routed Wroxeter<br />\n10-2: shutting them out for three<br />\nstraight quarters. With one game<br />\nleft, the JV's record now stands<br />\nat 7- 1 .<br />\nTouting one of the toughest<br />\nhigh school attack units in the<br />\ncountry, with at least one<br />\nall-American attackman,<br />\nWroxeter was indeed a potent<br />\nfoe. In the first quarter, they<br />\nplayed Hopkins even, scoring<br />\ntwice. Both came on Dan Lamon<br />\nfeeds to Coleman Wilson.<br />\nHopkins maintained a three point<br />\nadvantage, however, with Doober<br />\nAburn scoring the first two<br />\nunassisted and Carl Yeich making<br />\nup the difference late in the<br />\nperiod on a feed from Joe Devlin.<br />\nThe second quarter remained<br />\nfairly even. Though full of<br />\nbroken clears (most of them<br />\nHopkins') and unsettled<br />\nsituations, both teams' defenses<br />\nplayed well as no goals were<br />\nposted by either team.<br />\nThe third quarter was the real<br />\ntest for both teams. Although the<br />\nBaby Jays held a one-point lead,<br />\nWroxeter had the type of team<br />\nwhich could easily stage a<br />\ncomeback. To win, Hopkins had<br />\nto keep them from building any<br />\nkind of scoring momentum.<br />\nThat took them less than a<br />\nminute to do. With 23 seconds<br />\nelapsed, Doober Aburn took a<br />\nflip-off from Joe Devlin and<br />\nbounced the ball past Wroxeter's<br />\ngoalie to put Hopkins ahead 4-2.<br />\nAlthough they staged several<br />\ndrives throughout the rest of the<br />\nquarter, Wroxeter was unable to<br />\nconvert on any of them. The<br />\nBaby Jays, for their part,<br />\nwidened their lead to 6-2 on<br />\nunassisted goals by P.J. Boyle<br />\nand Chuck \"Chuckles\" Clarvit.<br />\nOnce the fourth quarter began,<br />\nit became apparent that the Baby<br />\nJays owned the game. Totally<br />\nrattled by Hopkins, Wroxeter<br /><br />\ncould barely keep from throwing<br />\nthe ball out of bounds. The Baby<br />\nJays sealed the Mustangs fate in<br />\nthe middle of the quarter scoring<br />\nfour quick goals, including one<br />\nby Doober Aburn, his fourth.<br />\nParticuarly impressive was the<br />\nBaby Jays extra-man defense.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins' clobbered the<br />\n2 minutes worth<br />\n/<br />\nMustangs with 91<br />\nof penalties (over 3/4 of a<br />\nquarter), Wroxeter could not<br />\nconvert any of them. Kudos go<br />\nto Ron Hall, Bernie Eisel, and<br />\nJim \"Ref\" Condon for their<br />\ndefensive assist in this effort.<br />\nThe Baby Jays wind up their<br />\nseason today when they take on<br />\nthe Navy JV Squids at Navy at<br />\n3:00.

The big<br />\ndisappointment of the meet,<br />\nhowever, was the unfortunate<br />\nligament pull that Schreiber<br />\nsuffered in the long jump<br />\ncompetition which cut short his<br />\nfinal season at Hopkins.<br />\nThe Jays then defeated<br />\nWashington College Tuesday,<br />\n9 2-5 1 as Lon Massaglia,<br />\nrecovering from an injury, won<br />\nthe 100 and 220-yard dashes,<br />\nwhile John Coad won the shot<br />\nand discus events.

In five<br />\ngames this year they have only<br />\nallowed an average of six goals<br />\nper contest!<br />\nStifling the Jays offense will<br />\nbe no easy task however. The<br />\npotent Hopkins offensive<br />\nmachine has been averaging<br />\nnearly 19 goals per game, mostly<br />\nfrom the attack trio of Franz<br />\nWittelsberger, Mike O'Neil and<br />\nRichie Hirsch.
