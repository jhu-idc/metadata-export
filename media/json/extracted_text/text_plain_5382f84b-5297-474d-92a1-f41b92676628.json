You<br />\nsee, even you as a young person<br />\nwill recognize at least those<br />\nnames.<br />\nWe've had excellent<br />\nsuccess in our country in virtually eliminating most of those. I<br />\nshould add, though, and if you<br />\nread the newspapers, and if<br />\nyou're married and you have a<br />\nyoung child already, you will<br />\nrecognize that measles and<br />\n<br />\nwhooping cough, which we ally, but they haven't disappearthought we'd eliminated,in fact, ed in fact.<br />\nThen I come to the second<br />\nyou never do, because each new<br />\ngeneration must deal with the aspect of the title which I know<br />\nsame diseases.

She hopes to get as much<br />\ncampus-wide participation as<br />\npossible before the second semester work load begins. \"We are<br />\ntrying to make this into a<br />\ntradition,\" she said. \"We would<br />\nlike to get many groups involved<br />\nso plans can reflect campus<br />\ninterests.\" She added that if<br />\nDisorientation is a success this<br />\nyear, it may be established as an<br />\ninnual event.<br />\n<br />\ndred years apart. The other part<br />\nof the global population is about<br />\none hundred years behind us.<br />\nThat I also continually emphasize. Now when I reach Earth<br />\nDay, what was it, about ten<br />\nyears ago; in the sixties, say,<br />\nroughly. I was once confronted<br />\nwith let me say the ecological<br />\nethic, by simple definition. The<br />\nemphasis on the fact that<br />\neverything is related to everything else in a natural sense,and<br />\ntherefore, we must be very<br />\ncareful that anything we do, we<br />\ndo not disturb anymore than is<br />\neither necessary or desirable,<br />\nnature. I buy that concept, to<br />\nbegin with. Once I buy it, then<br />\nwhatever I do in my environmental control, I want to be sure<br />\nthat my wisdom, my logic,<br />\nresults in minimum interference<br />\nor destruction of what we call<br />\nnature.<br />\nIn my talk, I also used<br />\nseveral common examples, such<br />\nas solid waste, and the other is<br />\nthat which leads to tremendous<br />\ninterest in our country at the<br />\nmoment,hazardous waste.<br />\nN-L - Chemicals ?<br />\nWolman: Well, largely chemicals, so-called toxic wastes.<br />\nWhen you think about hazardous wastes or hazardous waste<br />\ndumps, you probably think of<br />\ntoxic chemicals. By way of<br />\nillustration of several things,<br />\nsuch as dilemmas in combinations, because actually we're not<br />\nonly creators of them, but also<br />\n<br />\nbeneficiaries of nhem. That of<br />\ncourse leads to another aspect<br />\nwhich you needn't hear a lot<br />\nabout:<br />\nWe're always equating risk<br />\nand benefits. When you speak<br />\nof hazardous wastes, you want<br />\nto say, 'Well, maybe I'd better<br />\nclose down all industries,' and<br />\nyou say to yourself, 'Well,<br />\nmaybe that's not so good.'<br />\nWhen I come to soliclwaste, it<br />\nhas a lower toxicity. That is<br />\nthe garbage of the. city. Then,<br />\nyou say, 'Well, as long as I'm<br />\nhere, no wizard in EPA or<br />\nanywhere else has been able to<br />\neliminate that.' I've already said<br />\nof the solid waste and liquid<br />\nwaste like sewage, that I don't<br />\nknow of any legislative group<br />\nthat's changed the physiology of<br />\nman. He still produces waste.<br />\nFrom my point of view, this has<br />\nbeen a major source of headache<br />\nall over the globe. They're<br />\nthere, and no matter how much<br />\n1 might advocate the ecologic<br />\nethic, I'm confronted with it,<br />\nand I have to do something with<br />\nit.

As a result of it, publishers are not<br />\nbuying as much as they were. The market may be<br />\nrestricted, but the quality of the stuff coming out now is<br />\nquite good. The future of the field? , The 1930's were a<br />\nperiod of space opera; the '40's were a time when the<br />\nfocus shifted to straight scientific development; the<br />\n'50's were an attempt at more \"sociological\" science<br />\nfiction; the '60's were an example of the importation of<br />\nmore literary devices which hadn't been used in science<br />\nfiction before ;ithe.'70's represented a synthesis of all of<br />\nthese trends. There have been science fiction books<br />\nwhich have made the best seller list over the past few<br />\nyears. Publishers are more willing to take a chance with<br />\nscience fiction than they were five years ago in terms of<br />\nmass marketing and mainstream novels. There has been<br />\nsome slowing because of the general slump of the<br />\neconomy and the fact that the publishing industry did<br />\nhave its first drop in sales in the first quarter of '79.<br />\n(2) Has the increased popularity of science fiction given the field more respectability?<br />\nASIMOV: That I don't know. A great deal of<br />\nthe popularity has arisen out of the movies and television, and some of them are scarcely respectable. But<br />\nI think that the number of skillful practicioners, especially in printed science fiction, is increasing and that the<br />\nfield is gaining considerable respect. For instance, in the<br />\nfield of literary criticism, the field of academia,and so<br />\non, popularity does not necessarily mean respect, but in<br />\nthe case of science fiction there is a certain amount of<br />\nrespect for it.<br />\nBRUNNER: It you're talking about the new<br />\npopularity due to things like Star Wars, The Empire<br />\n<br />\n\fhence. In the past six months to a year, the publishing<br />\nmarket and especially the science fiction market has<br />\nbeen pretty soft at the \"we're-buyingimanuscripts\" level.<br />\nI'm not sure whether this means that we are going to see<br />\na reduction in the volume of books published in 1981 or<br />\n1982,but it suggests that fact.<br />\nN1VEN: Yes, and this despite the fact that Star<br />\nWars is on the level of Edmund Hamilton rather than<br />\nArthur C. Clarke. People see Star Wars, they like it, they<br />\nre-think as to whether they really despise science fiction, and if they have good advice they turn on to such<br />\nthings as Ursula K. LeGuin's The Left Hand ofDarkness<br />\nor Frank Herbert's Dune or any of the really good<br />\nscience fiction that is being written and has been written<br />\nfor the last ten or fifteen years.<br />\n<br />\n517E<br />\n<br />\nGRAM<br />\nTOM<br />\n3N1<br />\n<br />\n144006<br />\nStrikes Back and so forth, no because the majority of<br />\nmass-marketed science fiction reamins as badly worked<br />\nout,as illogical, or as uncertain within its own terms as it<br />\nalways has been.<br />\nBENFORD: Respect for its economic impact,<br />\nyes. I don't see any increased respect for its aesthetic<br />\nvalues, but I don't see that anywhere else either.<br />\nDICK: I think that it has been taken over to a<br />\nlarge degree by what is called space adventure (movies<br />\nsuch as Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, which I<br />\ndo not regard as science fiction) at this point, and they<br />\nhave pushed true science fiction a little bit to the side. I<br />\ndefine science fiction as \"a story which contains a<br />\ngenuinely new idea\" rather than \"an adventure set in the<br />\nfuture.\" I think that true science fiction will make a<br />\ncomeback and will become extremely important as the<br />\nspace exploration program develops.<br />\nLEIBER: To a degree, yes. The mere fact that it<br />\ntaught in the schools is a sign of increased<br />\nbeing<br />\nis<br />\nrespect.<br />\nLUPOFF: This \"new popularity\" is not a<br />\nfirst-time phenomenon. If you look at the history of<br />\nscience fiction in this century (or at least in the most<br />\nrecent half-century), then you find that there are repeated upswings and downswings. There has been a<br />\nlong-term trend toward increasing popularity, but it has<br />\nbeen three steps forward and two steps back. Each<br />\ntime that we jump forward, we backslide again, but not<br />\nquite as far as the previous time. Over a long haul,<br />\nscience fiction is increasing in size of its audience and its<br />\nrespectability, but it is not a straight-line progression.<br />\nWe are merely in one of the upswing periods. I'm a little<br />\nhesitant about this, though, because I talked to my<br />\nagent, other writers, my editors and other editors, and<br />\nthe market for the past six months to a year has been<br />\n\"soft\" (my agent's term, but nonetheless an indicative<br />\none). This is an anticipatory phenomenon; the stock<br />\nmarket looks at profit and iloss statements from corporations not when they come out but six months beforehand. The publishers buy not on the basis of how many<br />\nbooks are being sold and published today but on how<br />\nthey expect them to be published and sold a year or two<br />\n<br />\nSILVERBERG: Oh, no question.

Do it<br />\nthis way.\" No ,it calls for a change of heart rather than<br />\nany revolution in technology. We have the technology;<br />\nit's being grossly misapplied.<br />\n<br />\nof our problems with technology. It's very handy<br />\nfor solving the most material of them,and I think that it<br />\nhas done a splendid job of it this century despite the<br />\nscarier aspects of some technologies. Is there an upper<br />\nlimit? Probably not; I don't see any upper limits to<br />\nwhat it can do. Aspects of our technology are amuck-what happened to Hiroshima was certainly an example<br />\nof technology amuck, but I suppose that if you had<br />\ngiven the same people machetes, they would have<br />\naccomplished the same thing but in a slower, bloodier<br />\nmanner. The aspects which are the most out of control<br />\nare pollution and our corruption of the environment.<br />\nWe should not be frightened of what we're doing but<br />\nmore of how to clean up after ourselves. I mourn the<br />\ndeath of the space program, but getting off the earth<br />\nwon't solve our problems. We can't just export them<br />\nelsewhere; we have to clean up things on this planet first.<br />\n<br />\nDICK: We won't find that out until we continue<br />\nto apply technology. We should not assume a theoretical limit until one is discovered because it might turn<br />\nSPINRAD: It depends upon what you mean by<br />\nout to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Technology should \"all your problems.\" Technology can't solve anyone's<br />\nbe given every benefit of the doubt. It is very possible moral, spiritual or emotional problems. I don't think<br />\nthat it will solve so many problems that it will be a boon that anyone would seriously say that it could. I think<br />\nrather than a loss to us.<br />\nthat potentially one or two hundred years it is entirely<br />\npossible that we will be total masters of matter and<br />\nLEIBER: Yes, there are limits to what tech- energy in a scientific or technological sense, but that of<br />\nnology can do by itself. It cannot solve emotional course does not solve our philosophical or psychological<br />\nproblems, but by and large it helps to have more people problems. I think that it is a mistake to look to science<br />\nwell off, a definite product of technology.<br />\nand technology for things of the spirit or of emotions.<br />\n<br />\nSTURGEON: I don't think that's really a fair<br />\nquestion. I don't think that there is any upper limit to<br />\nwhat the human mind can conceive, and I believe that<br />\nwhat Man can conceive Man can achieve. Technology is<br />\nnot something in and of itself. I can take a hand-axe and<br />\na tree trunk and carve you a beautiful sculpture, or I can<br />\nsplit your head with it. What can the axe, the axe being<br />\ntechnology, do? It depends on how it is used. There<br />\nbeing no upper limit to what man can achieve, therefore<br />\nthere is no upper limit to what technology can achieve, I<br />\ndon't believe that technology will ever be our master.<br />\nSome people will treat it like that at different periods of<br />\ntime, but by and large I think that Man is the master of<br />\nhis own technology.<br />\nTUNING: I think that there is probably an<br />\nupper limit to what technology can accomplish, but I<br />\ndon't believe that any one human being is capable of<br />\nvisualizing it. Technology will make us all filthy rich by<br />\ncurrent standards, but it can stumble, too. It is important to keep in mind the distinction between technology<br />\nand science; technology is just the application of<br />\nbreakthroughs in pure science, which are bound to occur<br />\nand are not bad in themselves. Technology will solve<br />\nNiven, Asimov (above)/ Zelazny, Brunner (below) many thorny<br />\nlittle problems as a result (such as counterLUPOFF: I believe that technology can do gravity and faster-than-light travel), so there's no reason<br />\nanything, but it can't do everything. We have to make to turn our backs on it because of one or two<br />\nsessions of<br />\nchoices, and the choices we have been making are not bashing our brains a ainst the wall.<br />\nvery wise ones. The biggest problem which the world<br />\nfaces today (and this is not going to startle you at all)<br />\nis this: When I look at all the things which we, the<br />\nhuman race, are doing wrong, the most dangerous mistake it is making is breeding so damn fast. We act as if<br />\nthe globe did not have a finite surface area. It does,<br />\nthough, and can five people live where three people<br />\nlived previously? Probably so, but how about eight?<br />\nYes, but it's going to begin to get crowded. How about<br />\nten? It's going to get very crowded. How about twenty? Well,no,it's not going to work, we're going to begin<br />\ndying off, we're going to have more people than we<br />\ncan feed. I really fear that this rather fragile, technologically-based modern civilization that we have may<br />\nabsoluately go crash, the most immediate sign of the<br />\ncrash being a nuclear war or another crisis of a global<br />\nscale--a world-wide famine, a plague, God knows what.<br />\nThe real underlying cause is too many and still-increasing<br />\nnumbers of people vying for limited resources. I'm sorry<br />\nto be so negative, but I gaze into the crystal ball, and<br />\nNorman Spinrad \u2014 New Wave of science fiction<br />\nthat's what comes up.<br />\nVARLEY: I doubt that anything can solve all<br />\nour problems.

In many cases,<br />\nthe problems you face after solving one will be worse,<br />\nZELAZNY: I don't know whether it can solve<br />\nand that takes some guesswork. For instance, an orbit- all our problems. We often confuse problems created by<br />\ning solar power plant can send its power down by men and their devices with problems inherent in the<br />\nmicrowaves or by lasers. It may be that the laser is more device itself. Sometimes I think the word \"problem\" is a<br />\nefficient, and having built the power plant you have semantic trap; H.L. Mencken in his essays of some years<br />\nsolved certain problems--you don't have to burn coal or ago commented on the phrase \"social problem\" as<br />\noil in your generators, so therefore the air becomes a lot making the situation look good by turning it into a<br />\ncleaner. On the other hand, you have made legitimate mathematical exercise where there is a solution. Some<br />\nworry about putting a weapon in orbit. A laser big things don't necessarily have solutions. It seems to<br />\nme<br />\nenough to send down large amounts of power--enough to that the problems created by the technology of<br />\nthe<br />\nsupply a large city, say--is a weapon whether you like it modern world--pollution, power shortages, and what<br />\nor not.

It was a<br />\nlightweight musical back in 1928, bolstered by such immortal talents as Ruth<br />\nEtting and Eddie Cantor, whose antics<br />\nsaved the dreary book and gave life to the<br />\nshow's many excellent songs. In 1980,<br />\nunfortunately,. even Imogene Coca's inspired clowning, along with some very<br />\ngood interpolated numbers, can't help the<br />\nthreadbare production. With few exceptions the cast sang like a vintage hinge,<br />\nwhich is especially sad because the Eddie<br />\nDavis Society Jazz Orchestra's accompaniment blasted out the score in all its<br />\ncampy glory. When the singing died<br />\ndown there was tap-dancing by a puny<br />\nchorus of eight or ten, which at best<br />\nresembled a Virginia reel, at worst a<br />\nMerill Lynch commercial.<br />\nThe book is guaranteed to offend<br />\nanyone who identifies with women,<br />\nnative Americans,and good jokes. Set in<br />\nthe fairly wild West of the late twenties,<br />\nthe show opens with Sheriff Bob's(Frank<br />\nSilvano) impending wedding to Sally<br />\nMorgan (Laura Turnbull). Sheriff Bob<br />\nbailed out Sally's father some years back,<br />\nand now takes her hand as collateral. But<br />\nalas, Sally really loves Wanenis, (Paul<br />\nElkin), a genuine Dartmouth-educated<br />\nIndian. Also enter Henry Williams (Ted<br />\nPritchard), hypocondriac and exceptional<br />\nwimp, who is adored by sexpot Mary<br />\nCuster (Mamie Van Doren), his very<br />\npractical nurse. Sally denounces her<br />\nmarriage and tells the sheriff she and<br />\nHenry have eloped.<br />\nHijinks ensue.<br />\nHenry's flivver suffers an impromptu gas crisis in mid-desert, which<br />\nprovides enough time for a song and<br />\n<br />\ndance, as well as his discovery of the<br />\nalleged elopement. Just as the fuelless<br />\ncouple panic, a Lincoln pulls up with<br />\nChester Underwood (Dennis Angulo)<br />\nmillionaire landowner, his daughter Harriet (Imogene Coca), who pants after<br />\npants, and chauffeur nephew Jerome<br />\n(King Donovan). Harriet sings about<br />\nmen, Henry robs Chester's spare gasoline,<br />\nand the couple escapes.<br />\nThe Ford conks out at the Bar<br />\n\"M\" Ranch where we meet caretaker<br />\nAndy McNabb (Bill Rowley) and his<br />\nhilarious, Harpoesque companion Toad<br />\n(Bryan Foster),. Toad is too sloshed to<br />\ncook for Chester and company, so Andy<br />\npersuades (with a meat cleaver) Henry<br />\nand Sally to substitute. Chester, Harriet,<br />\nand Jerome arrive. Chester gets drunk<br />\nand can't identify the robbers, which is<br />\nfine with Sheriff Bob, who just wants to<br />\nfind his wife-to-be.<br />\nWanenis, in despair, returns to his<br />\ntribe and renounces the white man's<br />\nconfusing ways. He is joined by Henry,<br />\nand both paleface and Indians pass the<br />\npeacepipe and sing a little. Both men,<br />\nhowever, yearn for life back in civilization. During this time the elopement<br />\nmisunderstanding clears up, and Mary<br />\nCuster at last successfully pursues Henry.<br />\n<br />\n\"Guaranteed to offend anyone who identifies with good jokes.\"<br />\nWanenis, with the blessing of both white quite dramatic and compelling, althougE'<br />\nand red man's gods, takes Sally. This nowhere nearly as powerful as Ruth<br />\nleaves Sheriff Bob, who completes the Etting's. \"Yes, Sir, That's My Baby\"<br />\nthird marriage with Harriet (twenties appears right after \"Love Me or Leave<br />\nmusicals were very big on mass mar- Me\", and supposedly fits will, but Pritchard's lackluster performance, coupled<br />\nriages).<br />\nA few musical numbers are with the chorus' tired dancing, drains out<br />\nnoteworthy.

For<br />\ngene Coca almost stops the show twice: example, an Indian chief sees three<br />\nwith \"My Heart is Just a Gypsy\", sung to attractive women pass, and says<br />\na male gypsy chorus which magically \"Chance\" to each. Why not \"How\"?<br />\nappears from the Lincoln;and with a very The Chief replies, \"Me know how; me<br />\nfunny (if somewhat degrading) striptease want chance.\" If this turns you on,<br />\nspoof, complete with dirty sneakers and here's another: Henry is seated in a<br />\nbaggy raincoat.

He asks,<br />\nrendition of \"Love Me or Leave Me\" is \"Where did you get this canoe?\" The<br />\nfirst Indian replies, \"Sears,\" while the<br />\nsecond says, \"Roebuck\". Should your<br />\nthighs be sore from those two, you'd<br />\nbetter consult Russell Baker for emergency treatment.<br />\nOverall, I can't imagine why<br />\nanyone other than a devout Imogene<br />\nCoca fan or twenties music buff would<br />\npay thirty-two dollars for two orchestra<br />\nseats to this mindless diversion.

There are<br />\nseveral moments of pure vision, namely<br />\n\"Life's Been Good,\" \"Take It Easy,\" and<br />\n\"Take It to the Limit,\" and a singular<br />\nmoment of wasted vinyl, \"Heartache<br />\nTonight.\" No matter how good a band<br />\nthe Eagles are, and they are unquestionably the best rock California has to<br />\noffer, they often put treasury notes<br />\nwhere their musical notes should be. The<br />\nfourteen cuts on Eagles Live are nearly<br />\nEagles Greatest Hits Volume II; seven of<br />\nthe tracks are from the past two albums,<br />\nthree cuts are available on no other<br />\nEagles' albums (two Joe Walsh tunes and<br />\na new cut), and there is one old tune.<br />\n<br />\n\"Saturday Night,\" that is not on Greatest<br />\nHits. Nevertheless, the three superlative<br />\ncuts and four definitive versions of other<br />\ntunes redeem this album.<br />\nThe \"let's make it sell\" ethic<br />\nresults in cuts so close to the studio<br />\nversions that the casual listener will fail to<br />\nseparate the two. \"New Kid in Town\" is<br />\nfar and away the carbon copy tune of the<br />\nalbum, yet one must keep in mind that it<br />\nwas recorded from a concert before Hotel<br />\nCalifornia was released. \"Desperado,\"<br />\n\"Hotel California,\" \"Wasted Time,\" and<br />\n\"Saturday Night\" also fall into the<br />\nsound-alike category. \"Desperado just<br />\nshows the length the group has gone to.<br />\nsell albums--the listed playing time is<br />\nthirty-one seconds longer than the true<br />\nplaying time, which happens to be<br />\n<br />\n,exactly the same as the studio version's<br />\nlength.<br />\nThe new cut, \"Seven Bridges<br />\nRoad,- by Steve Young,shows the Eagles<br />\nexhibiting their best instruments-their<br />\nvoices.<br />\nIts five-parts harmony and<br />\ntwo-acoustic-guitar accompaniment is<br />\nsimple but seductive, and prove the<br />\nEagles are not afraid to return to their<br />\ncountry roots.<br />\nThe biggest question about the<br />\nalbum is why a song as inferior as \"Saturday Night\" was included when \"Already Gone,\" one of the group's best<br />\nconcert songs, was absent. Another<br />\ndubious cut is \"Heartache Tonight.\"<br />\nAgain, in concert the song really stirs<br />\nup the crowd, but this version is extremely flat. The major reason is that it<br />\nfeatures probably the worst vocal effort<br />\nFrey ever put on vinyl. His voice is the<br />\ncenterpiece of the song, and without it<br />\nthe tune collapses. Henley also cops out<br />\non the drums, opting for a simpler<br />\ncymbal run at the end of each verse for<br />\nno apparent reason. this track should<br />\ndefinitely have been scrapped.<br />\nFour cuts on the album stand<br />\nabove any of their previous recordings.<br />\n\"The Long Run,\" still the \"let's write a<br />\nTop 40 hit\" song of the Eagles shows new<br />\nvibrancy, as both Frey's underneath<br />\nguitar work and Henley's vocals improve<br />\ndramatically. Also, a special ending with<br />\nPhil Kenzie on sax gives the song added<br />\nfife. The added emotion of \"I Can't Tell<br />\nYou Why\" also outdoes the studio<br />\nversion, particularly because of the<br />\nprominence of the organ, which is down-<br />\n<br />\nplayed on the \"Long Run\" track.<br />\nYet the major improvement is the<br />\nguitar work and personality of Joe Walsh.<br />\nWhen Walsh joined the group in 1976 he<br />\nadded a harder edge to the Eagles sound,<br />\nand Eagles Live best shows his influence<br />\non the group. \"Life in the Fast lane\"<br />\nimproves both because of his guitar solo<br />\nat the end and the two-drum-set work of<br />\nDon Henley and Joe Vitale, Walsh's<br />\ndrummer in his barnstorming days. The<br />\nEagles should probably make Vitale their<br />\nsixth member (he did tour with the group<br />\nthis year) as his work on drums, keyboards, and flute would open new musical venues. Walsh again provides a<br />\nhighlight with \"All Night Long\" from the<br />\nUrban Cowboy soundtrack. Containing<br />\nprobably the best guitar riff hook of the<br />\nyear, it is a mindless,fun romp,improved<br />\nby a fake ending in which Walsh seeks out<br />\nnew territory on guitar.<br />\nBut Walsh saves his best work for<br />\n\"Life's Been Good.\" One of the three<br />\nbest cuts on the discs, Walsh manages to<br />\ntransform the Eagles into a true rock<br />\nband. Glen Frey, Don Felder, and, Walsh<br />\nmeld perfectly on guitars to give Walsh's<br />\nunique voice the background it deserves<br />\non the song about life as a rock star.<br />\nEven Henley on drums manages an effort<br />\nabove his usually average drumming (not<br />\nquite the Ringo Starr Syndrome), and<br />\nwhen Walsh begins to crank on the ending<br />\nsolo, he creates a golden moment of<br />\nguitar work.<br />\n\"Take It Easy\" is also a superlative cut, as it has grown so much in the<br />\ncont. on p. 15<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nThe Seven Samurai<br />\n<br />\nA Masterpiece OfArtistry In Pure Storytelling<br />\nBY TOM GRANT<br />\nIt is impossible for me to point at<br />\nany one film and say ,\",That is my favorite film of all time; that film appeals to<br />\nmy aesthetics and appreciation of the<br />\nfilmaker's art more than any other... I<br />\ncan limit the choices though; there is a<br />\nset of films, each a unique entity with its<br />\nown species of excellence, and Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai is undoubtedly<br />\none of these. It is a showcase of Kurosaw-a's brilliance as both a director<br />\nand a storyteller, and because of its<br />\nemphasis on the latter talent, it stands<br />\nartistically distance from his other major<br />\n- Throne of Blood, and<br />\nworks (Rashomo<br />\nto a lesser extent, Yojitii-bo.)<br />\nLike all of Kurosawa's films, The<br />\nSeven Samurai is set in feudal' Nippon. A<br />\ngroup of peasants is being terrorized by a<br />\nband of brigands who force tribute from<br />\nthe farmers until they are left with barely<br />\nenough food to stay alive, and in an<br />\neffort to strike back, a delegation from<br />\nthe village (peasant-style: three . poor<br />\nfarmers and a paltry slim of money) is<br />\nsent into town to hire the services of<br />\nsome ronin (mercenary samurai)to scare<br />\naway the bandits or, if necessary, exterminate them.<br />\nEvery Kurosawa film is a being<br />\nwith its own peculiar nature which<br />\ncontrasts it with the body of his other<br />\nmajor works, and the main distinguishing<br />\ncharacteristic of The Seven Samurai is its<br />\n)ersonality as a story told with artistry<br />\nrather than a piece of artistry with<br />\na story written around it. A good example of the se,:ond category is Rashomon, a film about the relativity of truth<br />\nrather than the story of .a wealthy samurai who is murdered.(9)and his wife<br />\nraped (?)\u2022 The Seven Samurai has no<br />\npretentions about making a philosophical<br />\npoint,but that does not decrease its worth<br />\nin the slightest. The first time that you<br />\nsee the film, you become so engulfed in<br />\n<br />\nthe story that the analytical centers of sharp-edged humor, sorrow at , someone's<br />\nyour brain shut down temporarily, and untimely death, and jubilation over the<br />\nyour involvement in the action smothers excitement of life like very few films ever<br />\nyour tendencies to dissect the plot, made. Kurosawa expertly places the<br />\nbelievability of the characters and the audience next to the characters and<br />\ndepth of their characterization, pacing forces them to feel as they feel, thuE<br />\n<br />\nToshiro Mifune, Minoru Chiaki, and Takashi Shimura in Seven Samurai<br />\nof the direction, etc. The film is an making the film's suspensidn of disbelief<br />\nexample of mastery of the art of storytel- one of its strongest.aspects.<br />\nAs usual, Mifune is given first<br />\nling, of capturing an audience's attention<br />\nand holding it in the celluloid world that billing in the credits, but for once he is<br />\nhas been conjured, and because ofi this not the centerpiece of the acting and the<br />\nthe three and a half hours of footage focus of the characterization. His role, a<br />\nwhich constitute the movie seem to be no wild firebrand of a samurai, is the most<br />\nlonger than the normal two hours one flamboyant personality of the seven, but<br />\nexpects in a feature film. The Seven he shares the screen equally with the rest<br />\nSamurai is an adventure story,and unlike of the group. Although one may justimost movies which fall under that head- fiably consider the characters to be<br />\ning, the label is a compliment, not a slightly stereotypical, there are not<br />\nuninteresting.

Against Hopkins,<br />\nhowever, he completed 15 of 25<br />\npasses for 196 yards and on TD.<br />\nBut it was on the ground<br />\nwhere Selfridge really shone, as<br />\nhe led all rushers in the game<br />\nwith 143 yards, with a 7.5<br />\nyards-per-carry average.<br />\nHe<br />\nrepeatedly picked up large<br />\nchunks of yardage on option<br />\nsweeps despite a Blue Jay<br />\ndefense massed to prevent them.<br />\n\"I really can't find an<br />\nanswer for my off-season,\" said<br />\nSelfridge, \"but in the last couple<br />\nof games I got my confidence<br />\nback.\"<br />\nthe Terrors' running game<br />\nwas by<br />\nno means onedimensional. Bain added 134<br />\nyards as the Terrors totalled 346<br />\nyards on the ground. \"We had<br />\ntwo goals,\" said Pfeifer. \"One<br />\nwas to contain Bain and the<br />\nother was to contain Selfridge,<br />\nand we didn't do either of<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nThe game was actually three<br />\ngames in one. The first quarter<br />\nwas dominated by Hopkins,<br />\nwhile the second quarter was<br />\n<br />\ndominated by Western Maryland. The second half--well, it<br />\nwould be harder to imagine a<br />\nwilder thirty minutes.<br />\nThings began auspiciously<br />\nThe<br />\nenough for the Jays.<br />\nTerrors attempted a reverse<br />\non the opening kick and fumbled instead. The Blue Jays<br />\nrecovered at the Terror nine,<br />\nsetting up the first Margraff-toStromberg touchdown hookup.<br />\nJeff Harris added a 42-yard field<br />\ngoal, only three yards short of<br />\nhis Blue Jay record, to boost the<br />\nJays' lead 10 10-0.<br />\nThe Jays had several<br />\nchances to push their lead over<br />\nhigher. Margraff hit Doug Max<br />\nin the end zone, only to see the<br />\nscore nullified by a penalty.<br />\nJohn Potthast dropped a pass<br />\ndeep in Terror territory, and<br />\nMargraff threw behind Bruce<br />\nKane in the same spot on the<br />\nvery next play.<br />\nWhile Margraff was held to<br />\n17 yards passing in the second<br />\nquarter, the Terrors roared back<br />\nto take the lead. Selfridge<br />\ncapped a series of long runs with<br />\na five-yard scamper for one<br />\nscore, and found Dan Fielder<br />\n<br />\nwide .open in the end zone on a<br />\n12-yard pass with 1:23 remaining in the half.<br />\nThe 81-yard pass didn't<br />\nruffle the Terrors. After getting<br />\nthe kickoff, the Terrors needed<br />\nonly 11 plays to drive 80 yards<br />\nfor a 21-17 lead. First Selfridge<br />\nhit Fielder on a short flare pass<br />\nthat Fielder turned into a<br />\n32-yard gain.<br />\nThen faced<br />\nwith a fourth-and-five at the<br />\nBlue Jay 43, Selfridge again<br />\nburned the Jays with a sweep for<br />\n22 yards. Bain plunged one yard<br />\nfor the score.<br />\nIt took only a minute for<br />\nthe Jays to bounce back. Margraff quickly hit Stromberg,<br />\nPotthast, and Mike Crecco to set<br />\nup a seven-yarder to Stromberg,<br />\nhis third score, for a 23-21 lead.<br />\ncontinued<br />\nSelfridge<br />\nto<br />\nmatch Stromberg blow for blow,<br />\nnetting 27 yards on another<br />\nsweep before giving the Terrors a<br />\n29-23 lead on an eight-yard run<br />\nand another run for two points.<br />\nThe Jays got the lead back<br />\nwith 12:52 remaining when<br />\nKevin Keefer broke loose for 28<br />\nyards to set up a two-yard run<br />\nby Crecco.<br />\n<br />\nNo such game would be<br />\ncomplete without controversy,<br />\nand the next drive provided<br />\nit. Selfridge found what at first<br />\nseemed to be completion to<br />\nMark Chadwick inside the Blue<br />\nJay 10,but safety Jeff Whittaker<br />\ncame up and wrestled furiously<br />\nwith Chadwick for the ball.<br />\nWhittaker was awarded the<br />\ninterception.<br />\nThe Jays were forced to<br />\npunt, but disaster struck the<br />\nTerrors: Rick Conner returned<br />\nthe punt deep into Hopkins<br />\nterritory, only to fumble it<br />\naway.<br />\nBut the Terrors would get<br />\none more chance--which proved<br />\nto be one chance too many.<br />\nDespite the many setbacks.<br />\nthe Jays seem determined to get<br />\nup off the ropes. \"The people<br />\ncoming back, so many of them<br />\nare anxious to get started again,\"<br />\nsaid Pfeifer. \"Many of our guys<br />\nare lifting already.<br />\nIt was<br />\ndisappointing but not demoralizing; it was frustrating, but it<br />\ndidn't destroy the program.The Jays are still, in general,<br />\na young team, and no one has<br />\ngiven up yet.<br />\n<br />\nHarriers Send One of Their Own<br />\nTo Division Nationals Tomorrow.<br />\nBY JEFF BICKART<br />\nThis past Saturday, November 15. the men's cross-country<br />\nteam finished its 1980 season at<br />\nthe Mideastern Regional Championstlips, held near Lebanon<br />\nValley College. All team members are now finished, that is,<br />\nexcept Dave Stewart. Hopkins'<br />\ntop runner turned in a sterling<br />\n15th place performance and has<br />\nqualified for the National Division III cross-country championships. to be run tomorrow at the<br />\nUniversity of Rochester. The<br />\ntop three teams, and the top six<br />\nrunners not on one of the top<br />\nthree teams, go to the Nationals.<br />\nDave was the fifth of those six.<br />\neight places ahead of the sixth<br />\nqualifier. Had he not been taken<br />\nout of the running by sudden<br />\nillness, the other Hopkins frontrunner, Andrew Brescia, would<br />\nhave gone to the Nationals alsohe and Stewart ran within<br />\n<br />\nseconds 0t each other all<br />\nthrough the season.<br />\nThe team, crippled by Brescia's absence, nevertheless placed<br />\n20th out of 28. Jeff Bickart<br />\ntook 74th in the 8000-meter<br />\nrace (26:44.0), John Roemer<br />\n121st (27:51), Dave Grinnel<br />\n153rd (29.00), and Will Feld-<br />\n<br />\nDave Stewart<br />\n<br />\nman 172nd (33:07).<br />\nDave<br />\nStewart's time was 25:22; Eric<br />\nHutniboe of F&M, fully recovered from stomach problems and<br />\nhis f; 1st 'place finish at the<br />\nMAC' championships the week<br />\nbefore, won the race in 24:34<br />\nAt the finish line of the MAC<br />\nchampionship.<br />\ncross,ountry<br />\nheld<br />\nNovember<br />\n8 at Widener, anyone could<br />\nhave made a good guess at the<br />\nthe probable results in . the<br />\nRegional, when Stewart and<br />\nBrescia tied for eighth place out<br />\nof 125 runners, with a time of<br />\n25:44.6 on the 8000-meter.<br />\ncourse. Their teammates also ran<br />\nwell in the most important meet<br />\nof the season, and helped secure.<br />\n7th place out of nineteen teams,<br />\nan improvement by one place<br />\nover last year's performance.<br />\nJeff Bickart took 41st, John<br />\nRoemer 56th, and Dave Grinnell<br />\n94th.<br />\n<br />\nSports Comment-Einoif<br />\nThe News-Letter & Women's Sports - Do They Mix ?<br />\nWhen I came to Hopkins<br />\nthree years ago, from the University of Delaware, I noticed<br />\nthat the News-Letter was decidedly unfair to the cause of the<br />\nwomen's sports movement on<br />\nthis campus and in the country.<br />\nSince then, 1 have made a<br />\nconcerted effort to \u2022 encourage<br />\na fair coverage of all available<br />\nsports at JHU, women's sports<br />\nincluded. Due to space commitments, we have been unable to<br />\nkeep pace with recent controversy centering on the \"merger\"<br />\nof the AIAW and the NCAA. In<br />\na later issue, I hope to summarize the available information<br />\nand present it in its entirety.<br />\nThis week, I would like to<br />\n<br />\naddress the issues of equality<br />\nhere at Hopkins, a topic brought<br />\nhome to me by a letter I received, through the N-L, from<br />\nCarol Hahn, '80, a woman very<br />\nmuch involved with the women's<br />\nprogram here at Hopkins. Since<br />\nshe gave me permission to print<br />\nthe letter. I will excerpt here:<br />\nAt the beginning of the<br />\nschool year there were articles in<br />\nboth men's and women's sports.<br />\nThough the number of events<br />\nthat the respective sexes are<br />\ninvolved in seems to be the<br />\nsame, lately there has been little<br />\nmention of women's sports.<br />\n(Forgive me if this situation<br />\nhas changed in the past week, as<br />\nmy News-Letter arrives more<br />\n<br />\nthan a week .after it's been<br />\npublished.) You have shown<br />\nyour personal dedication to<br />\nequality in sports reporting<br />\nover the years that you have<br />\nbeen at Hopkins. No one has<br />\ninvested more time and energy<br />\nthan you in trying to rectify an<br />\nalmost hopelessly unbalanced<br />\nsituation. Please don't stop trying.<br />\nWe aren't about to stop<br />\ntrying, this week or any other,<br />\nbut I think I should clarify<br />\nsome things about women's<br />\nsports at JHU.<br />\nWomen at<br />\nHopkins can participate in eight<br />\nintercollegiate sports, while the<br />\nnational average (NCAA News,<br />\nOct. 15) for Division III is 6.5.<br />\n<br />\nThe Division I average for<br />\nwomen is only 7.5, while for<br />\nmen it is 10.5; in men.s competition, Ilopkins has 12 Div. III<br />\nteams.<br />\nWhile the chances for participation are great, women at<br />\nHopkins participate in only<br />\nabout half (97/55) as many<br />\ncompetitive events as the men.<br />\nWomen's sports have advanced<br />\nto a level where they are beginning to be accepted at the<br />\ncollege level, but they, have yet<br />\nto be accepted at the professional level, and roughly 70<br />\npercent of our sports page is<br />\ndevoted to those sports, either at<br />\nthe college or professional level,<br />\nwhich have gained professional<br />\n<br />\nstatus, i.e. football, baseball,<br />\nsoccer, basketball, and for the<br />\nnonce,lacrosse.<br />\n. The last and most important<br />\nfeature of dealing with women's<br />\nsports is the invariable problem<br />\nwith the unavailability of Hopkins' part-time coaching staff.<br />\nThis phenomenon is by no<br />\nmeans limited to the women<br />\nalone - the part-time coaches of<br />\nall sports are virtually impossible<br />\nto reach, and many of our<br />\nwriters, myself included, tend to<br />\ngive up before we manage to<br />\ncontact one.<br />\nWe are trying to interest students in women's sports as both<br />\nspectators and participants.

And when they<br />\n<br />\nreturned from vacation they were back<br />\nwith clean clothes and some self-respect.<br />\nUntil the cycle started up again.

They took no care of their appearance. They seldom washed their clothes,<br />\nnever ironed them. They let their corn-<br />\n<br />\ncouldn't help but feel that they were only<br />\ninterested in my body.<br />\nI talked to my father about it. \"It<br />\nwas the same at Hopkins when I was<br />\nthere in the early fifties. I guess it's<br />\nalways been that way.\" He got a far-off<br />\nmelancholy look in his eye as he spoke.<br />\n\"We really thought we could change it,<br />\nlet them know we were more than<br />\nbodies.\"<br />\nI asked what had happened.<br />\nHe replied sadly,\"I don't know, it<br />\njust sort of died. Next thing I knew I was<br />\nmarried and raising a family. I love my<br />\nfamily but still you sometimes wonder...<br />\nwhat if.\"<br />\n<br />\nI was infuriated. Twenty five<br />\nyears had gone by and Hopkins hadn't<br />\nchanged. Female professors were still<br />\ntaking advantage of men. We were<br />\nrespected no more than our fathers were.<br />\nThe equality movement that's been<br />\nsweeping the nation has passed us by.<br />\nBut we don't have to take it any<br />\nlonger. The age has come for us to<br />\nexpress our sexuality and compete<br />\nequally. By retaining the look that has<br />\n\"nurd\" written all over it we are still<br />\nslaves to their desires. The time has come<br />\nwhen a man can wear finely tailored<br />\nsports coats to class, unbutton your shirt,<br />\nexpose some chest hair.<br />\nRight now there's not a female<br />\nprofessor in the country who can afford<br />\nto be openly accused of sexual harrassment. You don't have to be ashamed to<br />\nmake charges openly. The shame of<br />\nadmitting that it happens has allowed the<br />\nsystem to go unchanged.<br />\nI've heard of cases where men<br />\nhave faced the added embarrassment of<br />\nbeing told by their school's academic<br />\ncouncil that they deserved harrassment,<br />\nthat unbuttoning the top button or two<br />\nand smiling at the professor only led her<br />\non, and that it was in fact his fault.<br />\n<br />\nThe shame of<br />\nadmitting that it<br />\nhappens allowed<br />\nthe system to go<br />\nunchanged<br />\nThis is, to say the least, a disgrace.<br />\nNo such case has come up before the JHU<br />\nAcademic Council but when it does we<br />\nmen better by damn sure that we won't<br />\nlet the women of that council embarrass<br />\nus further.<br />\n<br />\nthe move toward<br />\nequality and<br />\nmutual respect<br />\nmust start now!<br />\nI have chosen the most difficult<br />\npath for my last year.

Now,<br />\nin some circles there is a return to the<br />\n\"High tech\" mechanization of the Le<br />\nCorbusien doctrine.<br />\nAnd what man can forget the<br />\nonslaught of the sterile, clean environment. We were told that it was best to<br />\nexpress the more \"feminine\" side of our<br />\npersonalities, that neat and clean were<br />\nsymbols of our newly found sensitivity.<br />\nBut today, the \"Me Decade\" has<br />\nfinally caught up with interior decorating.<br />\nAnd at the same time, one interpretation<br />\nof \"Form follows function\" is incorporated into our new decorating scheme.<br />\n<br />\nIf you're<br />\ncomfortable<br />\nleaving your bed<br />\nunmade,don't<br />\nmake it<br />\nA college man's apartment serves<br />\ntwo purposes: first it is a place to live,\"to<br />\nlive\" incorporates eating, sleeping, entertaining, and all that we do for ourselves,<br />\nthe other purpose is a place to study.<br />\nThus it is no longer necessary to<br />\nkeep things which impede your studying<br />\nor living. But most importantly,and here<br />\nenters the \"me\" aspect, you should no<br />\nlonger feel tied to conventions of what<br />\nconstitutes a \"home.\" If you're comfortable leaving your bed unmade, don't<br />\nmake it. A made bed impeds the true<br />\nfunction. Why make a bed just to unmake it? It's much easier to leave it as is<br />\nin the morning and pick up where you<br />\nleft off that night.<br />\n<br />\nThe same is true of things. Dishes<br />\nwill only procede to get dirty.

I don't think so. Be yourself and let people see the real you, not<br />\nthe \"well-mannered\" or \"trained\" you<br />\nthat makes us all so similar, but the you<br />\nbeneath all of that. If you drink a lot of<br />\nbeer, let people know it. Don't feel you<br />\nhave to hide the empty bottles. If<br />\nyou had spaghetti last night, don't be<br />\nashamed, plenty of people eat spaghetti let the dishes rest! If you smoke a lot,let<br />\nthe ashtrays overflow; besides, you never<br />\nknow when you'll run out.<br />\nYou see, there's nothing wrong<br />\nwith being yourself and letting people see<br />\nhow you're most comfortable. The<br />\nfunction is your comfort, and the style is<br />\nyou.<br />\n\"But,\" you may ask, \"what if I<br />\nThe apartment came<br />\ncan't be me?<br />\nfurnished and doesn't express me.\" This<br />\nproblem arises frequently for the college<br />\nman. The answer is simple. The new style<br />\nis not to set guidelines or to consult rule<br />\nbooks; you don't have to put the typewriter on the typing table. You can do<br />\nwhatever you want. Just as you consider<br />\nthe layout of the apartment a \"given,\" so<br />\ntoo is the furniture that comes with it. If<br />\nyou don't like it, bury it. For this you<br />\ncan use your clothes or some old newspaper.<br />\n\"But I share a place with someone. What if ME and HIM clash.\" The<br />\nonly thing I find more invigorating than a<br />\nBach fugue is the counterpoint of two<br />\ndifferent ME styles expressed simultaneously. If your roommate can't stand<br />\nthe way you leave your things lying<br />\naround, leave his things lying around<br />\ninstead. The dichotomy of separate ME<br />\nstyles is particularly interesting when<br />\nentertaining. Newcomers to your place<br />\nwill expose their true opinions of you.

While some<br />\nstudents praise the pound-loss plan, it<br />\ndoes have some minor negative side<br />\neffects. Consult your doctor first before<br />\ntrying this diet.

Gosh, it was great to be<br />\nalive. He leafed through his notebook, admiring his day's work:<br />\npages and pages of observations and<br />\ncalculations. His equations were so<br />\nfinely, so precisely balanced they<br />\nbrought a tear of pride to his eye.<br />\nAh,science.<br />\nHe made his way back to the<br />\ndorms with his book-bag slung<br />\nintellectually over his shoulder.<br />\nStrolling past the insensitive jocks,<br />\nguitar-slinging artist-types, and<br />\npseudo-intellectual newspaper reporters that littered the quad,<br />\nWendell couldn't help noticing how<br />\nmuch better he was than any of<br />\nthem. He had motivation, he had<br />\npurpose! He could<br />\ndrive, had<br />\njust imagine all the admissions<br />\ndirectors of the East Coast's finest<br />\nmedical schools clamoring over<br />\nwhich of them would get the honor<br />\nof accepting him, Wendell Fortinbras, into their hallowed academy.<br />\nThe thought made him beam with<br />\nhappiness and he carried himself<br />\nthrough the quad like a prince.<br />\nUpstairs in his single, Wendell<br />\ntook a seat at this desk beneath the<br />\nwindow and began puttering with<br />\nhis calculator, occasionally gazing<br />\nout over the quad while waiting for<br />\ntrig functions to register. After<br />\nsolving a particularly difficult sinewave problem (of his own device),<br />\nhe happened to glance outside and<br />\ncatch a glimpse of Carolene Bettelheim as she crossed over to the<br />\ncafeteria. His glasses slipped off his<br />\nface.<br />\nWendell was in love with<br />\nCarolene Bettelheim: hopelessly,<br />\ndesperately in love, for she was<br />\ntotally unaware of his existence.<br />\nHe had tracked her down in the<br />\nFreshman Register and the Student<br />\nDirectory, knew everything about<br />\nher. She was an I.R. major from<br />\nDarien, Connecticut whose wardrobe consisted almost entirely of<br />\nsweaters, jeans and gym outfits<br />\nthat seemed to take on lives their<br />\nown when she wore them. Her<br />\nfigure was a marvel of geometry,<br />\na flawless juxtaposition of bellcurves and apexes that could cause<br />\neven the staunchest Quaker to start<br />\nacting like Mighty Joe Young.<br />\nWendell worshipped her. He had<br />\neven written poems dedicated to<br />\nher, and now he pulled one out at<br />\nrandom from a sheaf of papers on<br />\nhis desk and examined it:<br />\n<br />\n9tElfinzan SVo.i9<br />\nWatzEn<br />\n<br />\nsnickered and nudged the guy<br />\nsitting next to him, a football<br />\nplayer, by mistake. The guy stared<br />\nhim down until Trent finally<br />\nfumbled his apologies.<br />\n\"So you'll go?\" he said,<br />\nturning back to Wendell, beads of<br />\nnervous perspiration on his forehead.<br />\n\"Yes.\"<br />\n\"Great. I'll come past about<br />\nnine, then. Can I have that if<br />\n\"Come on Wendell, have you're not eating it?\"<br />\nsome fun. It's only a party. Gee<br />\nWendell sat in the corner<br />\nwhiz.\" Trent was talking between<br />\nsipping a Coke and trying to look<br />\nmouthfuls of tuna casserole.<br />\n\"Tonight?\" Wendell repeat- interested. The music was loud, the<br />\ned. \"I don't know. I've got a paper people were strangers.

One of them was staring<br />\nright at him.<br />\nIt was Carolene Bettelheim.<br />\nWendell was stunned. She looked<br />\nravishing, as usual, but now she had<br />\na funny sort of gleam in her eye,<br />\nand she was softly pursing and<br />\nunpursing her lips. Looking right at<br />\nhim! He could barely stand still.<br />\nAnd now (could it be?) she was<br />\ntaking a step in his direction!<br />\n<br />\nOrchestras boomed in Wendell's<br />\nhead. \"Oh, sweet mystery of life...\"<br />\nShe broke away from the<br />\nbunch and approached him, a<br />\nhalf-empty beer in her hand.<br />\n\"You're dribbling,\" she said.<br />\n\"Wh-what?\" He had crunched<br />\na piece of ice between his teeth and<br />\nnow it was leaking all over his chin.<br />\n\"Let me clean you up.\" The<br />\ngirls were laughing louder, but<br />\nWendell paid no attention. He was<br />\nstaring down deep into Carolene's<br />\nchocolatey brown eyes. She led<br />\nhim to a table where she took a<br />\nnapkin and began wiping his face.<br />\n\"What's your name?\" she asked.<br />\n\"Wendell.\"<br />\n\"I love it.\"<br />\n\"You do?\"<br />\n\"Sure.

Led her'on! \"You cad!\" he<br />\nshouted. \"How could you!\" No,<br />\nshe wasn't an untouchable freshman love goddess, she was just. . .a<br />\ngirl. A poor infatuated girl. And<br />\nnow another, more haunting<br />\nthought hit him: had he completely<br />\nruined his chances for a brilliant<br />\ncareer in private practice?<br />\nGuilt plagued him throughout the day. By dinnertime he<br />\ncould stand it no longer and he<br />\nburst out of the D-Level carrels in a<br />\nsweat, mumbling incoherently.<br />\nIt's not worth it, he told<br />\nhimself in the elevator up to the<br />\nmain floor of the library. Love<br />\nsimply must take a back seat to<br />\nstudy, there was no getting around<br />\nit. He would have to tell Carotene<br />\nright away, before she started<br />\ngetting serious. Sure, she would<br />\nbe hurt, but it would be better for<br />\nher in the long run. No, Wendell<br />\nFortinbras could not let a woman,<br />\nnot even Carotene Bettelheim,<br />\nstand in the way of his goal.<br />\nThe doors slid open and he<br />\nalmost bumped into Carotene on<br />\nher way in. He turned and called<br />\nto her but she gave no notice.<br />\nHe took to the stairs, search-<br />\n<br />\ning floors until he found her among<br />\nthe stacks on B-Level. \"Carotene!\"<br />\nhe whispered fiercely.<br />\n\"Hello,\" she said absently,<br />\nstaring at books.<br />\n\"It's me Wendell.\"<br />\nShe turned to face him.

He had triumphed.<br />\nOvercome his obsession. When he<br />\ngot back to his room he would<br />\nthrow out all that poetry and settle<br />\ndown into serious study once more.<br />\nAs long as he had his goal to<br />\nachieve and that calculator at his<br />\nbelt, everything would be fine.<br />\n99<br />\n<br />\nJiete<br />\n<br />\noice4<br />\necnjtao<br />\n- 17<br />\nky<br />\nohn: Am 1 boring?

But who's to say what is<br />\nreal and what is an allusion.<br />\n<br />\nIn my consciousness ;raising<br />\ngroup, people are always describing their<br />\ndreams. Many of them disturb me. They<br />\nare dirty and violent. I have one dream,<br />\nand I think my dream is beautiful.<br />\nIn it I am stepping out of a purling<br />\n<br />\nWcme Weditet<br />\nmountain stream, where I have just<br />\nbathed, when a lovely and dignified<br />\nwoman swirls up to me in a white gossamer robe. When I put on my glasses to<br />\nget a better view, I find that there is an<br />\nodd material, greasy like Vaseline on my<br />\nlenses. But the woman is so beautiful,<br />\nher gaze so radiant and direct, that I<br />\nforget. She stands on the mossy bank<br />\nholding two roses. She gives one to me as<br />\nI draw close, and I understand as if by<br />\nmagic that this is a gesture of friendship.<br />\nWe sit by the stream and talk of our<br />\nmutual respect for the sciences and<br />\nspiritual love\u2014the importance of mutual<br />\nrespect in a relationship. We write love<br />\nletters in the mud of the bank, and<br />\nsuddenly she is wearing jeans and a<br />\nfisherman's sweater. We splash each<br />\nother and sing \"Where Have All The<br />\n<br />\nFlowers Gone\" and other old favorites as<br />\nwe stroll hand in hand. But then my<br />\nloved one Runes to me, a little frown<br />\nplaying with her bountiful features.<br />\n\"Dear,\" she says, want you for<br />\na friend, but you're just not man enough<br />\nto be my lover.\"<br />\n\"But you're breaking rule no. 1 of<br />\nIlimsells Kindness is Kontagious Kode!\"<br />\nI say.<br />\n\"Sorry,\" she says with genuine<br />\ncompassion. \"But I won't be no ham<br />\nbovine to a manly joint such as yours!<br />\nWhy don't you try Right Place patent<br />\npending I1M12937 (see himself p. 13);<br />\nThat might up your chances a little, but<br />\nI'm not going to guarantee anything.\"<br />\nMy friends assured me that this<br />\nwas just the recurringl television dream<br />\nthat plagues all Hopkins men. They all<br />\nhave it in one form or another. So I have<br />\novercome my more immature self and<br />\nreached beyond it somehow. I went to<br />\nthe Rathskellar, that jocular meeting<br />\nground of college personalities, all radiant<br />\nand rosy checked, where one can engage<br />\nin polite conversation over a frothy mug<br />\nof brew. I was determined to find a girl<br />\nwho would look me in the eye, not the<br />\ncrotch, a girl I could warm up to, with<br />\nwhom I could exchange thoughts or<br />\njust share a private moment in silence, a<br />\ngirl with motivation, maturity,leadership<br />\nqualities, poise, charm, a Bloomingdale:s<br />\ncharge card, a rudimentary knowledge of<br />\nauto mechaniks, a mother with a Von<br />\nFurstenberg dress, a scent of Ivory soap,a<br />\nsoft hand, a shetland sweater, a warm<br />\nsmile.a father complex, an ironed shirt, a<br />\nclean face, black riding boots and a crop.<br />\nthe callypagian rondure of a Rhine<br />\nMaiden...<br />\nThat night I met Mary.

Would she feel for I<br />\nme in exactly that same special way?,Was<br />\nthis Love come to take me away on<br />\ngossamer wings? Was this an earthquake<br />\nor merely a shock? I pondered these<br />\nthings in my heart while Mary sipped her<br />\nbeer daintily through a candy striped<br />\nstraw. I wanted to...<br />\nMary: Ah Girls! I will always remember<br />\nJohn for the voluptuous sport he afforded me, shall I say the free play of the<br />\nfaculties. Was it but less fleeting! But<br />\nalas, Love, like Youth, flies with the<br />\nwings of Time's shifting sands, and<br />\nL'ennui is a snake in the lush grasses of<br />\nDesire. John was a man of contemplation<br />\nwhen first we met,his fair eyes transfixed<br />\nas if on some point far in the blue distance. Fairly a Hamlet he was,and I, his<br />\nbutterfly, Ophelia. I imagined he must be<br />\na poet, but actually he was a man- of<br />\nscience. (Though the way he scratched<br />\nhis limbs, I feared lest he had accruedthe<br />\ndropsy.) Of what thoughts he populated<br />\nthe void of his mind's cavity, I knew not,<br />\nneither did I care; I would fain speculate<br />\non the perfect volcano of smothered<br />\ndesire that surely bubbled and spewed<br />\n<br />\nforth the hot lava of d'amour beneath his<br />\ncool smooth brow.<br />\nI know the moment I set my<br />\ndewy eyes on the sleek line of his manly<br />\nform in that hive of, Love's pilgrims, the<br />\nRathskellar, that, indeed,he would desire<br />\na peek at my charming calf, and perhaps,<br />\nI hoped, at the divinity of my burnished<br />\nmarblelike thigh.<br />\nI approached, my<br />\nnerves all aquiver, to ask what o'clock it<br />\nmight be. With gentlemanly sobriety, he<br />\nconsulted his dial. Ah, the smooth<br />\ndelicacy of those fingers that might<br />\nfondle the poles of my panting white<br />\nglobes. Did he, in his flower of innocence, suspect my bold passion? No,<br />\nhe was far too absorbed in the furnishings<br />\nof his mind's chamber. It was for me to<br />\ndraw him out as one might the pearly<br />\ndroplet of honey from it's suckle. With<br />\npervasisve elequence, I drew his liquid<br />\neyes from that inward focus onto the<br />\nthreshold of my ruby lips and the purling<br />\ndepths of my fawn like eyes.<br />\nWe danced and I coultl sense the<br />\nsleeping giants of his biceps flexing,with<br />\nthe ghythm of the simple melody that the<br />\nminstrels played. My eyes made their<br />\nsweet pilgramage to what I imagined as<br />\n<br />\nthe downy concavity of his loins and, ah<br />\nbut I must quickly execute the thought<br />\nlest he think me over brazen a maid, the<br />\nseeming knot, the dart of Love,that pert<br />\nMr. Priapus, who made his dwelling in<br />\nLove's furrow there. Perhaps merely a<br />\nmodest blush would betray my rapturous<br />\nsentiments with proper poise. The music<br />\nhad become too loud for the employment<br />\nof comely forms of speech in my pursuit<br />\nof Love's fulfillment.<br />\nAnd such it was that I induced<br />\nthis reluctant Odysseus to taste of life's<br />\nrich tapestry and his body's hermit to<br />\nenter the mossy grotto between my<br />\nthighs. Alas how innocent a pupil he<br />\nwas and what trials I encountered in<br />\ntraining him to properly wield his weapon. Summarily, I would have awarded<br />\nhim an A for effort, a D for accuracy.<br />\nNevertheless, we were happy for a<br />\ntime: the pleasure of a stroll between<br />\nclasses, a warm brew at the coffee<br />\nshoppe, those evenings we read aloud- to<br />\none another until the book fell from our<br />\nblushing fingertips in a fresh onslaught of<br />\ndesire. Yet that wiley helmsman of<br />\nLove's ship desired to steer our sweet<br />\nvessel to boiling waters and rockier shores<br />\n<br />\nwhere we would encounter our separate<br />\ndestinies and drink the visceral draught of<br />\nloneliness. John said that I had set him<br />\npanning for that kernal of'genius at his<br />\nsoul's depth. He felt called upon to write<br />\npoetry, learn to pluck the guitar, and to<br />\nsearch for himself in that exotic land of<br />\nmany veils, The East. He left me to find<br />\nthat cocoa-skinned woman who would be<br />\nhis new guide toward Passion's hidden<br />\ntreasure. Shall I wait like Penelope for<br />\nmy sea-weary boy to return a man? Or<br />\ndoes not a brilliant new Apollo rise on<br />\nthe mind's horizon with every rosy dawn;<br />\nJohn: Mary taught me all I know of<br />\nsexual congress, and I love and respect<br />\nher for that. Sometimes I think we were<br />\ntoo passionate for this modern age we live<br />\nin. We made a chemical reaction with the<br />\npower of TNT. When I began tutoring<br />\nLing, a fellow bio major, in her English<br />\ngrammar it was too much for Mary, and<br />\nshe never forgave me for what she<br />\nimagined was a deep betrayal. I loved<br />\nMary, but sometines I'm glad we went<br />\nour separate ways. There are so many<br />\nother ewes to tup in the fields of Life.<br />\nI'll always remember her with fondness as<br />\nthe woman who made me the man I am.<br />\n<br />\n\fr-<br />\n<br />\n1 Movies<br />\n<br />\ni ii<br />\n11<br />\ni<br />\n:Self-Growths1<br />\n: Column 1<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\nNo Breaks in the<br />\nExcitement of Trojans<br />\n<br />\nThis spring, Paramount Pictures.is<br />\nreleasing The Trojan War, a Japanese<br />\nrendition of Homer's seminal epic, the<br />\nIliad.

The<br />\nemphasis on the fact that<br />\neverything is related to everything else in a natural sense,and<br />\ntherefore, we must be very<br />\ncareful that anything we do, we<br />\ndo not disturb anymore than is<br />\neither necessary or desirable,<br />\nnature.

By way of<br />\nillustration of several things,<br />\nsuch as dilemmas in combinations, because actually we're not<br />\nonly creators of them, but also<br /><br />\nbeneficiaries of nhem. That of<br />\ncourse leads to another aspect<br />\nwhich you needn't hear a lot<br />\nabout:<br />\nWe're always equating risk<br />\nand benefits. When you speak<br />\nof hazardous wastes, you want<br />\nto say, 'Well, maybe I'd better<br />\nclose down all industries,' and<br />\nyou say to yourself, 'Well,<br />\nmaybe that's not so good.'<br />\nWhen I come to soliclwaste, it<br />\nhas a lower toxicity. That is<br />\nthe garbage of the. city. Then,<br />\nyou say, 'Well, as long as I'm<br />\nhere, no wizard in EPA or<br />\nanywhere else has been able to<br />\neliminate that.'

As a result of it, publishers are not<br />\nbuying as much as they were. The market may be<br />\nrestricted, but the quality of the stuff coming out now is<br />\nquite good. The future of the field? , The 1930's were a<br />\nperiod of space opera; the '40's were a time when the<br />\nfocus shifted to straight scientific development; the<br />\n'50's were an attempt at more \"sociological\" science<br />\nfiction; the '60's were an example of the importation of<br />\nmore literary devices which hadn't been used in science<br />\nfiction before ;ithe.'70's represented a synthesis of all of<br />\nthese trends. There have been science fiction books<br />\nwhich have made the best seller list over the past few<br />\nyears. Publishers are more willing to take a chance with<br />\nscience fiction than they were five years ago in terms of<br />\nmass marketing and mainstream novels. There has been<br />\nsome slowing because of the general slump of the<br />\neconomy and the fact that the publishing industry did<br />\nhave its first drop in sales in the first quarter of '79.<br />\n(2) Has the increased popularity of science fiction given the field more respectability?<br />\nASIMOV: That I don't know. A great deal of<br />\nthe popularity has arisen out of the movies and television, and some of them are scarcely respectable. But<br />\nI think that the number of skillful practicioners, especially in printed science fiction, is increasing and that the<br />\nfield is gaining considerable respect. For instance, in the<br />\nfield of literary criticism, the field of academia,and so<br />\non, popularity does not necessarily mean respect, but in<br />\nthe case of science fiction there is a certain amount of<br />\nrespect for it.<br />\nBRUNNER: It you're talking about the new<br />\npopularity due to things like Star Wars, The Empire<br /><br />\nhence. In the past six months to a year, the publishing<br />\nmarket and especially the science fiction market has<br />\nbeen pretty soft at the \"we're-buyingimanuscripts\" level.<br />\nI'm not sure whether this means that we are going to see<br />\na reduction in the volume of books published in 1981 or<br />\n1982,but it suggests that fact.<br />\nN1VEN: Yes, and this despite the fact that Star<br />\nWars is on the level of Edmund Hamilton rather than<br />\nArthur C.

I<br />\ndefine science fiction as \"a story which contains a<br />\ngenuinely new idea\" rather than \"an adventure set in the<br />\nfuture.\" I think that true science fiction will make a<br />\ncomeback and will become extremely important as the<br />\nspace exploration program develops.<br />\nLEIBER: To a degree, yes. The mere fact that it<br />\ntaught in the schools is a sign of increased<br />\nbeing<br />\nis<br />\nrespect.<br />\nLUPOFF: This \"new popularity\" is not a<br />\nfirst-time phenomenon. If you look at the history of<br />\nscience fiction in this century (or at least in the most<br />\nrecent half-century), then you find that there are repeated upswings and downswings. There has been a<br />\nlong-term trend toward increasing popularity, but it has<br />\nbeen three steps forward and two steps back. Each<br />\ntime that we jump forward, we backslide again, but not<br />\nquite as far as the previous time. Over a long haul,<br />\nscience fiction is increasing in size of its audience and its<br />\nrespectability, but it is not a straight-line progression.<br />\nWe are merely in one of the upswing periods. I'm a little<br />\nhesitant about this, though, because I talked to my<br />\nagent, other writers, my editors and other editors, and<br />\nthe market for the past six months to a year has been<br />\n\"soft\" (my agent's term, but nonetheless an indicative<br />\none).

What it's going to take is a basic shift in our<br />\nperception of what technology is doing under present<br />\nauspices, and then say to the people who are currently<br />\nmisusing it, \"that is not the proper way to do it.

Set in<br />\nthe fairly wild West of the late twenties,<br />\nthe show opens with Sheriff Bob's(Frank<br />\nSilvano) impending wedding to Sally<br />\nMorgan (Laura Turnbull). Sheriff Bob<br />\nbailed out Sally's father some years back,<br />\nand now takes her hand as collateral. But<br />\nalas, Sally really loves Wanenis, (Paul<br />\nElkin), a genuine Dartmouth-educated<br />\nIndian. Also enter Henry Williams (Ted<br />\nPritchard), hypocondriac and exceptional<br />\nwimp, who is adored by sexpot Mary<br />\nCuster (Mamie Van Doren), his very<br />\npractical nurse.

Chester gets drunk<br />\nand can't identify the robbers, which is<br />\nfine with Sheriff Bob, who just wants to<br />\nfind his wife-to-be.<br />\nWanenis, in despair, returns to his<br />\ntribe and renounces the white man's<br />\nconfusing ways.

There are<br />\nseveral moments of pure vision, namely<br />\n\"Life's Been Good,\" \"Take It Easy,\" and<br />\n\"Take It to the Limit,\" and a singular<br />\nmoment of wasted vinyl, \"Heartache<br />\nTonight.\" No matter how good a band<br />\nthe Eagles are, and they are unquestionably the best rock California has to<br />\noffer, they often put treasury notes<br />\nwhere their musical notes should be. The<br />\nfourteen cuts on Eagles Live are nearly<br />\nEagles Greatest Hits Volume II; seven of<br />\nthe tracks are from the past two albums,<br />\nthree cuts are available on no other<br />\nEagles' albums (two Joe Walsh tunes and<br />\na new cut), and there is one old tune.<br /><br />\n\"Saturday Night,\" that is not on Greatest<br />\nHits. Nevertheless, the three superlative<br />\ncuts and four definitive versions of other<br />\ntunes redeem this album.<br />\nThe \"let's make it sell\" ethic<br />\nresults in cuts so close to the studio<br />\nversions that the casual listener will fail to<br />\nseparate the two. \"New Kid in Town\" is<br />\nfar and away the carbon copy tune of the<br />\nalbum, yet one must keep in mind that it<br />\nwas recorded from a concert before Hotel<br />\nCalifornia was released. \"Desperado,\"<br />\n\"Hotel California,\" \"Wasted Time,\" and<br />\n\"Saturday Night\" also fall into the<br />\nsound-alike category. \"Desperado just<br />\nshows the length the group has gone to.<br />\nsell albums--the listed playing time is<br />\nthirty-one seconds longer than the true<br />\nplaying time, which happens to be<br /><br />\n,exactly the same as the studio version's<br />\nlength.<br />\nThe new cut, \"Seven Bridges<br />\nRoad,- by Steve Young,shows the Eagles<br />\nexhibiting their best instruments-their<br />\nvoices.<br />\nIts five-parts harmony and<br />\ntwo-acoustic-guitar accompaniment is<br />\nsimple but seductive, and prove the<br />\nEagles are not afraid to return to their<br />\ncountry roots.<br />\nThe biggest question about the<br />\nalbum is why a song as inferior as \"Saturday Night\" was included when \"Already Gone,\" one of the group's best<br />\nconcert songs, was absent. Another<br />\ndubious cut is \"Heartache Tonight.\"<br />\nAgain, in concert the song really stirs<br />\nup the crowd, but this version is extremely flat. The major reason is that it<br />\nfeatures probably the worst vocal effort<br />\nFrey ever put on vinyl. His voice is the<br />\ncenterpiece of the song, and without it<br />\nthe tune collapses. Henley also cops out<br />\non the drums, opting for a simpler<br />\ncymbal run at the end of each verse for<br />\nno apparent reason. this track should<br />\ndefinitely have been scrapped.<br />\nFour cuts on the album stand<br />\nabove any of their previous recordings.<br />\n\"The Long Run,\" still the \"let's write a<br />\nTop 40 hit\" song of the Eagles shows new<br />\nvibrancy, as both Frey's underneath<br />\nguitar work and Henley's vocals improve<br />\ndramatically. Also, a special ending with<br />\nPhil Kenzie on sax gives the song added<br />\nfife. The added emotion of \"I Can't Tell<br />\nYou Why\" also outdoes the studio<br />\nversion, particularly because of the<br />\nprominence of the organ, which is down-<br /><br />\nplayed on the \"Long Run\" track.<br />\nYet the major improvement is the<br />\nguitar work and personality of Joe Walsh.<br />\nWhen Walsh joined the group in 1976 he<br />\nadded a harder edge to the Eagles sound,<br />\nand Eagles Live best shows his influence<br />\non the group. \"Life in the Fast lane\"<br />\nimproves both because of his guitar solo<br />\nat the end and the two-drum-set work of<br />\nDon Henley and Joe Vitale, Walsh's<br />\ndrummer in his barnstorming days. The<br />\nEagles should probably make Vitale their<br />\nsixth member (he did tour with the group<br />\nthis year) as his work on drums, keyboards, and flute would open new musical venues. Walsh again provides a<br />\nhighlight with \"All Night Long\" from the<br />\nUrban Cowboy soundtrack. Containing<br />\nprobably the best guitar riff hook of the<br />\nyear, it is a mindless,fun romp,improved<br />\nby a fake ending in which Walsh seeks out<br />\nnew territory on guitar.<br />\nBut Walsh saves his best work for<br />\n\"Life's Been Good.\" One of the three<br />\nbest cuts on the discs, Walsh manages to<br />\ntransform the Eagles into a true rock<br />\nband. Glen Frey, Don Felder, and, Walsh<br />\nmeld perfectly on guitars to give Walsh's<br />\nunique voice the background it deserves<br />\non the song about life as a rock star.<br />\nEven Henley on drums manages an effort<br />\nabove his usually average drumming (not<br />\nquite the Ringo Starr Syndrome), and<br />\nwhen Walsh begins to crank on the ending<br />\nsolo, he creates a golden moment of<br />\nguitar work.<br />\n\"Take It Easy\" is also a superlative cut, as it has grown so much in the<br />\ncont. on p. 15<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br /><br />\nThe Seven Samurai<br /><br />\nA Masterpiece OfArtistry In Pure Storytelling<br />\nBY TOM GRANT<br />\nIt is impossible for me to point at<br />\nany one film and say ,\",That is my favorite film of all time; that film appeals to<br />\nmy aesthetics and appreciation of the<br />\nfilmaker's art more than any other... I<br />\ncan limit the choices though; there is a<br />\nset of films, each a unique entity with its<br />\nown species of excellence, and Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai is undoubtedly<br />\none of these. It is a showcase of Kurosaw-a's brilliance as both a director<br />\nand a storyteller, and because of its<br />\nemphasis on the latter talent, it stands<br />\nartistically distance from his other major<br />\n- Throne of Blood, and<br />\nworks (Rashomo<br />\nto a lesser extent, Yojitii-bo.)<br />\nLike all of Kurosawa's films, The<br />\nSeven Samurai is set in feudal' Nippon. A<br />\ngroup of peasants is being terrorized by a<br />\nband of brigands who force tribute from<br />\nthe farmers until they are left with barely<br />\nenough food to stay alive, and in an<br />\neffort to strike back, a delegation from<br />\nthe village (peasant-style: three . poor<br />\nfarmers and a paltry slim of money) is<br />\nsent into town to hire the services of<br />\nsome ronin (mercenary samurai)to scare<br />\naway the bandits or, if necessary, exterminate them.<br />\nEvery Kurosawa film is a being<br />\nwith its own peculiar nature which<br />\ncontrasts it with the body of his other<br />\nmajor works, and the main distinguishing<br />\ncharacteristic of The Seven Samurai is its<br />\n)ersonality as a story told with artistry<br />\nrather than a piece of artistry with<br />\na story written around it. A good example of the se,:ond category is Rashomon, a film about the relativity of truth<br />\nrather than the story of .a wealthy samurai who is murdered.(9)and his wife<br />\nraped (?)\u2022 The Seven Samurai has no<br />\npretentions about making a philosophical<br />\npoint,but that does not decrease its worth<br />\nin the slightest. The first time that you<br />\nsee the film, you become so engulfed in<br /><br />\nthe story that the analytical centers of sharp-edged humor, sorrow at , someone's<br />\nyour brain shut down temporarily, and untimely death, and jubilation over the<br />\nyour involvement in the action smothers excitement of life like very few films ever<br />\nyour tendencies to dissect the plot, made.

The last occured<br />\nwith 33 seconds remaining.<br />\nThere were seven lead changes,<br />\nan 81-yard touchdown pass,<br />\n979 yards in total offense, two<br />\ncrucial fourth-quarter turnovers<br />\nby Western Maryland deep in<br />\nBlue Jay territory, and a hell of<br />\na lot of nail-biting.<br />\nBut it was what the Terrors<br />\ndid when they found themselves<br />\ntrailing. 30-29, and 90 yards<br />\nfrom the Hopkins goal line with<br />\nthree minutes .to play that<br />\nallowed them to finish the<br />\nseason at 5-4, while the Blue<br />\nJays woand up at 1-8. Terror<br />\nquarterback Jim Selfridge said<br />\nafterward, \"We said,'we believe<br />\nwe can do it,' and we went out<br />\n\u2022ind did it . I had no doubt we'd<br />\nBehind the running of Bryan Bain, the Terrors drove to the.<br />\nBlue Jay 45. Then Selfridge<br />\ntook over; runt ing 13 yards,<br />\nthen passing to Dan Fielder at<br />\nthe Blue Jay 22. It looked as<br />\nthough the game would be<br />\ndecided by Bill Johnson, a<br />\nreplacement for the Terrorc' stir,<br />\nplace kicker, Craig Walker. but<br />\nwith the ball at the 20,Selfridge<br />\nswept around left end and<br />\nwasn't stopped until he had<br />\ncrossed the goal line.<br />\nWestern<br />\nMaryland<br />\nThe<br />\nROTC started the game, scurrying .down horn a helicopter,<br />\nand bringing the game ball to an<br />\nastonished referee. It was fitting,<br />\nenough from the Hopkins standpoint, for the Jays immediately<br />\nlaunched an all-out air attack<br />\nrunning only once in the first<br />\nquarter (arid that a draw play).<br />\nJim Margraff led an asault on the<br />\nbook by<br />\nHopkins<br />\nrecord<br />\nthrowing 52 times. The Terror<br />\ndefense, however, proved equal<br />\nto the task, allowing Margraff<br />\nonly 21 completions, mainly in<br />\nthe third quarter, albeit for 286<br />\nyards.<br />\nThe clear star for the Jays<br />\nwas--who else?--Bill Stromberg.<br />\nHe is under consideration for<br />\nDivision III All-America honors,<br /><br />\nand he did nothing to discourage<br />\nthe selection committee Saturday. He hauled in 11 passes,<br />\neight of them in the second half,<br />\nfor 214 yards, only four yards<br />\nshort of the team record (which<br />\nhe holds, of course). His three<br />\ntouchdowns broke Joe Cowan's<br />\nBlue Jay career touchdown<br />\nrecord of 26, set back in 1968.<br />\nIt was Stromberg who was<br />\non the receiving end of the<br />\n81-yard pass that briefly gave<br />\nthe Jays a 17-14 lead early in the<br />\nsecond half. The play occured<br />\non a seemingly desperate secondand-34 situation with the momentum clearly in the Terror's<br />\nfavor; Stromberg .found a clear<br />\nfield in front of him after<br />\nmaking an over-the-shoulder<br />\ncatch.<br />\nOnly a short time later,<br />\nStromberg made an even more<br />\nincredible<br />\nplay, when he<br />\nknocked a pass out of the hands<br />\nof Terror safety Tom Knieriem<br />\nand somehow managed to catch<br />\nit himself.<br />\nAbove all else, however, it<br />\nwas the game of redemption for<br />\nSelfridge. An all-MAC selection<br />\nlast year, Selfridge admitted to<br />\nhaving an off-season, with a<br />\nmere 4.'z' :ompletion rate after<br />\neight games. Against Hopkins,<br />\nhowever, he completed 15 of 25<br />\npasses for 196 yards and on TD.<br />\nBut it was on the ground<br />\nwhere Selfridge really shone, as<br />\nhe led all rushers in the game<br />\nwith 143 yards, with a 7.5<br />\nyards-per-carry average.<br />\nHe<br />\nrepeatedly picked up large<br />\nchunks of yardage on option<br />\nsweeps despite a Blue Jay<br />\ndefense massed to prevent them.<br />\n\"I really can't find an<br />\nanswer for my off-season,\" said<br />\nSelfridge, \"but in the last couple<br />\nof games I got my confidence<br />\nback.\"<br />\nthe Terrors' running game<br />\nwas by<br />\nno means onedimensional. Bain added 134<br />\nyards as the Terrors totalled 346<br />\nyards on the ground. \"We had<br />\ntwo goals,\" said Pfeifer. \"One<br />\nwas to contain Bain and the<br />\nother was to contain Selfridge,<br />\nand we didn't do either of<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nThe game was actually three<br />\ngames in one. The first quarter<br />\nwas dominated by Hopkins,<br />\nwhile the second quarter was<br /><br />\ndominated by Western Maryland. The second half--well, it<br />\nwould be harder to imagine a<br />\nwilder thirty minutes.<br />\nThings began auspiciously<br />\nThe<br />\nenough for the Jays.<br />\nTerrors attempted a reverse<br />\non the opening kick and fumbled instead. The Blue Jays<br />\nrecovered at the Terror nine,<br />\nsetting up the first Margraff-toStromberg touchdown hookup.<br />\nJeff Harris added a 42-yard field<br />\ngoal, only three yards short of<br />\nhis Blue Jay record, to boost the<br />\nJays' lead 10 10-0.<br />\nThe Jays had several<br />\nchances to push their lead over<br />\nhigher. Margraff hit Doug Max<br />\nin the end zone, only to see the<br />\nscore nullified by a penalty.<br />\nJohn Potthast dropped a pass<br />\ndeep in Terror territory, and<br />\nMargraff threw behind Bruce<br />\nKane in the same spot on the<br />\nvery next play.<br />\nWhile Margraff was held to<br />\n17 yards passing in the second<br />\nquarter, the Terrors roared back<br />\nto take the lead. Selfridge<br />\ncapped a series of long runs with<br />\na five-yard scamper for one<br />\nscore, and found Dan Fielder<br /><br />\nwide .open in the end zone on a<br />\n12-yard pass with 1:23 remaining in the half.<br />\nThe 81-yard pass didn't<br />\nruffle the Terrors. After getting<br />\nthe kickoff, the Terrors needed<br />\nonly 11 plays to drive 80 yards<br />\nfor a 21-17 lead. First Selfridge<br />\nhit Fielder on a short flare pass<br />\nthat Fielder turned into a<br />\n32-yard gain.<br />\nThen faced<br />\nwith a fourth-and-five at the<br />\nBlue Jay 43, Selfridge again<br />\nburned the Jays with a sweep for<br />\n22 yards. Bain plunged one yard<br />\nfor the score.<br />\nIt took only a minute for<br />\nthe Jays to bounce back. Margraff quickly hit Stromberg,<br />\nPotthast, and Mike Crecco to set<br />\nup a seven-yarder to Stromberg,<br />\nhis third score, for a 23-21 lead.<br />\ncontinued<br />\nSelfridge<br />\nto<br />\nmatch Stromberg blow for blow,<br />\nnetting 27 yards on another<br />\nsweep before giving the Terrors a<br />\n29-23 lead on an eight-yard run<br />\nand another run for two points.<br />\nThe Jays got the lead back<br />\nwith 12:52 remaining when<br />\nKevin Keefer broke loose for 28<br />\nyards to set up a two-yard run<br />\nby Crecco.<br /><br />\nNo such game would be<br />\ncomplete without controversy,<br />\nand the next drive provided<br />\nit.

Due to space commitments, we have been unable to<br />\nkeep pace with recent controversy centering on the \"merger\"<br />\nof the AIAW and the NCAA. In<br />\na later issue, I hope to summarize the available information<br />\nand present it in its entirety.<br />\nThis week, I would like to<br /><br />\naddress the issues of equality<br />\nhere at Hopkins, a topic brought<br />\nhome to me by a letter I received, through the N-L, from<br />\nCarol Hahn, '80, a woman very<br />\nmuch involved with the women's<br />\nprogram here at Hopkins. Since<br />\nshe gave me permission to print<br />\nthe letter. I will excerpt here:<br />\nAt the beginning of the<br />\nschool year there were articles in<br />\nboth men's and women's sports.<br />\nThough the number of events<br />\nthat the respective sexes are<br />\ninvolved in seems to be the<br />\nsame, lately there has been little<br />\nmention of women's sports.<br />\n(Forgive me if this situation<br />\nhas changed in the past week, as<br />\nmy News-Letter arrives more<br /><br />\nthan a week .after it's been<br />\npublished.) You have shown<br />\nyour personal dedication to<br />\nequality in sports reporting<br />\nover the years that you have<br />\nbeen at Hopkins. No one has<br />\ninvested more time and energy<br />\nthan you in trying to rectify an<br />\nalmost hopelessly unbalanced<br />\nsituation. Please don't stop trying.<br />\nWe aren't about to stop<br />\ntrying, this week or any other,<br />\nbut I think I should clarify<br />\nsome things about women's<br />\nsports at JHU.<br />\nWomen at<br />\nHopkins can participate in eight<br />\nintercollegiate sports, while the<br />\nnational average (NCAA News,<br />\nOct. 15) for Division III is 6.5.<br /><br />\nThe Division I average for<br />\nwomen is only 7.5, while for<br />\nmen it is 10.5; in men.s competition, Ilopkins has 12 Div. III<br />\nteams.<br />\nWhile the chances for participation are great, women at<br />\nHopkins participate in only<br />\nabout half (97/55) as many<br />\ncompetitive events as the men.<br />\nWomen's sports have advanced<br />\nto a level where they are beginning to be accepted at the<br />\ncollege level, but they, have yet<br />\nto be accepted at the professional level, and roughly 70<br />\npercent of our sports page is<br />\ndevoted to those sports, either at<br />\nthe college or professional level,<br />\nwhich have gained professional<br /><br />\nstatus, i.e. football, baseball,<br />\nsoccer, basketball, and for the<br />\nnonce,lacrosse.<br />\n. The last and most important<br />\nfeature of dealing with women's<br />\nsports is the invariable problem<br />\nwith the unavailability of Hopkins' part-time coaching staff.<br />\nThis phenomenon is by no<br />\nmeans limited to the women<br />\nalone - the part-time coaches of<br />\nall sports are virtually impossible<br />\nto reach, and many of our<br />\nwriters, myself included, tend to<br />\ngive up before we manage to<br />\ncontact one.<br />\nWe are trying to interest students in women's sports as both<br />\nspectators and participants.

You don't have to be ashamed to<br />\nmake charges openly. The shame of<br />\nadmitting that it happens has allowed the<br />\nsystem to go unchanged.<br />\nI've heard of cases where men<br />\nhave faced the added embarrassment of<br />\nbeing told by their school's academic<br />\ncouncil that they deserved harrassment,<br />\nthat unbuttoning the top button or two<br />\nand smiling at the professor only led her<br />\non, and that it was in fact his fault.<br /><br />\nThe shame of<br />\nadmitting that it<br />\nhappens allowed<br />\nthe system to go<br />\nunchanged<br />\nThis is, to say the least, a disgrace.<br />\nNo such case has come up before the JHU<br />\nAcademic Council but when it does we<br />\nmen better by damn sure that we won't<br />\nlet the women of that council embarrass<br />\nus further.<br /><br />\nthe move toward<br />\nequality and<br />\nmutual respect<br />\nmust start now!<br />\nI have chosen the most difficult<br />\npath for my last year.

And as styles change,so<br />\ndoes that which one's living space is<br />\nsupposed to express.<br />\nWe all remember how Le Corbusier's maxim \"Form follows Function\"<br />\nrevolutionized interior decorating. Now,<br />\nin some circles there is a return to the<br />\n\"High tech\" mechanization of the Le<br />\nCorbusien doctrine.<br />\nAnd what man can forget the<br />\nonslaught of the sterile, clean environment. We were told that it was best to<br />\nexpress the more \"feminine\" side of our<br />\npersonalities, that neat and clean were<br />\nsymbols of our newly found sensitivity.<br />\nBut today, the \"Me Decade\" has<br />\nfinally caught up with interior decorating.<br />\nAnd at the same time, one interpretation<br />\nof \"Form follows function\" is incorporated into our new decorating scheme.<br /><br />\nIf you're<br />\ncomfortable<br />\nleaving your bed<br />\nunmade,don't<br />\nmake it<br />\nA college man's apartment serves<br />\ntwo purposes: first it is a place to live,\"to<br />\nlive\" incorporates eating, sleeping, entertaining, and all that we do for ourselves,<br />\nthe other purpose is a place to study.<br />\nThus it is no longer necessary to<br />\nkeep things which impede your studying<br />\nor living. But most importantly,and here<br />\nenters the \"me\" aspect, you should no<br />\nlonger feel tied to conventions of what<br />\nconstitutes a \"home.\" If you're comfortable leaving your bed unmade, don't<br />\nmake it. A made bed impeds the true<br />\nfunction. Why make a bed just to unmake it? It's much easier to leave it as is<br />\nin the morning and pick up where you<br />\nleft off that night.<br /><br />\nThe same is true of things. Dishes<br />\nwill only procede to get dirty. Books put<br />\non shelves will have to be taken off again.<br />\nAll this menial housework stands opposed<br />\nto the functions of your apartment,living<br />\nand studying.<br />\nSome friends ask me if this type<br />\nof apartment living isn't worrisome when<br />\nentertaining. I don't think so. Be yourself and let people see the real you, not<br />\nthe \"well-mannered\" or \"trained\" you<br />\nthat makes us all so similar, but the you<br />\nbeneath all of that. If you drink a lot of<br />\nbeer, let people know it. Don't feel you<br />\nhave to hide the empty bottles. If<br />\nyou had spaghetti last night, don't be<br />\nashamed, plenty of people eat spaghetti let the dishes rest! If you smoke a lot,let<br />\nthe ashtrays overflow; besides, you never<br />\nknow when you'll run out.<br />\nYou see, there's nothing wrong<br />\nwith being yourself and letting people see<br />\nhow you're most comfortable. The<br />\nfunction is your comfort, and the style is<br />\nyou.<br />\n\"But,\" you may ask, \"what if I<br />\nThe apartment came<br />\ncan't be me?<br />\nfurnished and doesn't express me.\" This<br />\nproblem arises frequently for the college<br />\nman. The answer is simple. The new style<br />\nis not to set guidelines or to consult rule<br />\nbooks; you don't have to put the typewriter on the typing table. You can do<br />\nwhatever you want. Just as you consider<br />\nthe layout of the apartment a \"given,\" so<br />\ntoo is the furniture that comes with it. If<br />\nyou don't like it, bury it. For this you<br />\ncan use your clothes or some old newspaper.<br />\n\"But I share a place with someone. What if ME and HIM clash.\" The<br />\nonly thing I find more invigorating than a<br />\nBach fugue is the counterpoint of two<br />\ndifferent ME styles expressed simultaneously. If your roommate can't stand<br />\nthe way you leave your things lying<br />\naround, leave his things lying around<br />\ninstead. The dichotomy of separate ME<br />\nstyles is particularly interesting when<br />\nentertaining. Newcomers to your place<br />\nwill expose their true opinions of you.

Sick of Scarsdales,<br />\nStillmans and the like? Well, your days<br />\nof frustrating fatness are over. New<br />\nstudies released by the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Center for Fat Control reveal<br />\nnew ways to peel off those pounds.<br /><br />\nAlimentary<br />\nRegurgitation<br />\nAction<br />\nScientists discovered that freshman<br />\non Hopkins' own Homewood campus<br />\nachieved drastic weight-loss after several<br />\nweeks of dorm living. Interestingly<br />\nenough, students- question reported no<br />\ndecrease of food intake. Scientists found,<br />\nupon closer observation and questioning,<br />\nthat the students were unable to keep the<br />\ncafeteria food down, and consequently,<br />\ncounld lose weight regardless of the<br />\namount of food intake. While some<br />\nstudents praise the pound-loss plan, it<br />\ndoes have some minor negative side<br />\neffects. Consult your doctor first before<br />\ntrying this diet. Persons of normal weight<br />\nor under should not attempt this plan.<br />\n41 *<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n4. *\u2022*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nThe Robert0.<br />\nCoca-Cola Diet<br />\nThis plan offers a safe, easy method<br />\nfor dispairing dieters. It includes only<br />\none meal a day, to be ingested at whatever time and to consist of as much food<br />\nas the dieter can cram into his or her<br />\nmouth. Fast food franchises provide the<br />\nideal quickness, quantity, and quality<br />\nneeded although any food will do. At<br />\nany other time of the day or night, the<br />\ndiet may be supplemented with CocaCola only. The corbonation in this drink<br />\nhas the effect of filling you with gas so<br />\nthat you feel full, while the caffeine<br />\nspeeds up you metabolism and burns off<br />\nthose nasty calories. One satisfied dieter<br />\nsuggests that you keep a hip flask with<br />\nyou at all times and have a two-liter<br />\nbottle by your bed at night to curb those<br />\nmidnight urges to munch.<br /><br />\nthe Twinkies behind the radiator, hide<br />\nthe M&amp;M's in your dirty socks, push the<br />\npizza under your bed, or conceal the<br />\ncookies under your couch cusions.<br />\nJudicious placement of old newspapers,<br />\ndirty laundry and various uncleansed<br /><br />\nkitchen utensils also create handy hiding<br />\nplaces. The added advantage of this<br />\nmethod is that if you ever find the food<br />\nagain, it will be so nauseating as the<br />\ndispel _my pangs of hunger for a good 24<br />\nhours.<br /><br />\n* Have you been studying too efficiently?<br />\n* Haven't had to pull an all-nighter in weeks?<br />\n* Are you being ostracized by your B-level buddies?<br />\nNot to worry!

Gosh, it was great to be<br />\nalive. He leafed through his notebook, admiring his day's work:<br />\npages and pages of observations and<br />\ncalculations. His equations were so<br />\nfinely, so precisely balanced they<br />\nbrought a tear of pride to his eye.<br />\nAh,science.<br />\nHe made his way back to the<br />\ndorms with his book-bag slung<br />\nintellectually over his shoulder.<br />\nStrolling past the insensitive jocks,<br />\nguitar-slinging artist-types, and<br />\npseudo-intellectual newspaper reporters that littered the quad,<br />\nWendell couldn't help noticing how<br />\nmuch better he was than any of<br />\nthem. He had motivation, he had<br />\npurpose! He could<br />\ndrive, had<br />\njust imagine all the admissions<br />\ndirectors of the East Coast's finest<br />\nmedical schools clamoring over<br />\nwhich of them would get the honor<br />\nof accepting him, Wendell Fortinbras, into their hallowed academy.<br />\nThe thought made him beam with<br />\nhappiness and he carried himself<br />\nthrough the quad like a prince.<br />\nUpstairs in his single, Wendell<br />\ntook a seat at this desk beneath the<br />\nwindow and began puttering with<br />\nhis calculator, occasionally gazing<br />\nout over the quad while waiting for<br />\ntrig functions to register. After<br />\nsolving a particularly difficult sinewave problem (of his own device),<br />\nhe happened to glance outside and<br />\ncatch a glimpse of Carolene Bettelheim as she crossed over to the<br />\ncafeteria. His glasses slipped off his<br />\nface.<br />\nWendell was in love with<br />\nCarolene Bettelheim: hopelessly,<br />\ndesperately in love, for she was<br />\ntotally unaware of his existence.<br />\nHe had tracked her down in the<br />\nFreshman Register and the Student<br />\nDirectory, knew everything about<br />\nher. She was an I.R. major from<br />\nDarien, Connecticut whose wardrobe consisted almost entirely of<br />\nsweaters, jeans and gym outfits<br />\nthat seemed to take on lives their<br />\nown when she wore them. Her<br />\nfigure was a marvel of geometry,<br />\na flawless juxtaposition of bellcurves and apexes that could cause<br />\neven the staunchest Quaker to start<br />\nacting like Mighty Joe Young.<br />\nWendell worshipped her. He had<br />\neven written poems dedicated to<br />\nher, and now he pulled one out at<br />\nrandom from a sheaf of papers on<br />\nhis desk and examined it:<br /><br />\n9tElfinzan SVo.i9<br />\nWatzEn<br /><br />\nsnickered and nudged the guy<br />\nsitting next to him, a football<br />\nplayer, by mistake.

Led her'on! \"You cad!\" he<br />\nshouted. \"How could you!\" No,<br />\nshe wasn't an untouchable freshman love goddess, she was just. . .a<br />\ngirl. A poor infatuated girl. And<br />\nnow another, more haunting<br />\nthought hit him: had he completely<br />\nruined his chances for a brilliant<br />\ncareer in private practice?<br />\nGuilt plagued him throughout the day. By dinnertime he<br />\ncould stand it no longer and he<br />\nburst out of the D-Level carrels in a<br />\nsweat, mumbling incoherently.<br />\nIt's not worth it, he told<br />\nhimself in the elevator up to the<br />\nmain floor of the library.

Sure, she would<br />\nbe hurt, but it would be better for<br />\nher in the long run. No, Wendell<br />\nFortinbras could not let a woman,<br />\nnot even Carotene Bettelheim,<br />\nstand in the way of his goal.<br />\nThe doors slid open and he<br />\nalmost bumped into Carotene on<br />\nher way in. He turned and called<br />\nto her but she gave no notice.<br />\nHe took to the stairs, search-<br /><br />\ning floors until he found her among<br />\nthe stacks on B-Level. \"Carotene!\"<br />\nhe whispered fiercely.<br />\n\"Hello,\" she said absently,<br />\nstaring at books.<br />\n\"It's me Wendell.\"<br />\nShe turned to face him.

He had triumphed.<br />\nOvercome his obsession. When he<br />\ngot back to his room he would<br />\nthrow out all that poetry and settle<br />\ndown into serious study once more.<br />\nAs long as he had his goal to<br />\nachieve and that calculator at his<br />\nbelt, everything would be fine.<br />\n99<br /><br />\nJiete<br /><br />\noice4<br />\necnjtao<br />\n- 17<br />\nky<br />\nohn: Am 1 boring? I like to<br />\nthink of myself as a regular kind<br />\nof guy. But I stare into the palm<br />\nof my hand sometimes when I'm alone<br />\nfor hours wondering what all those queer<br />\nlittle lines mean. Are they a map to<br />\nhidden treasure? The meaning of my life,<br />\nabsolute, ,2ternal? Are they the pattern of<br />\nmy fate, perhaps; a destiny of great glory<br />\nand fame (a leader), or the life of the<br />\nlittle man, so full of the sweetness of<br />\nsimple pleasures, the joys of the soil,<br />\ndomestic bliss. But who's to say what is<br />\nreal and what is an allusion.<br /><br />\nIn my consciousness ;raising<br />\ngroup, people are always describing their<br />\ndreams. Many of them disturb me. They<br />\nare dirty and violent. I have one dream,<br />\nand I think my dream is beautiful.<br />\nIn it I am stepping out of a purling<br /><br />\nWcme Weditet<br />\nmountain stream, where I have just<br />\nbathed, when a lovely and dignified<br />\nwoman swirls up to me in a white gossamer robe. When I put on my glasses to<br />\nget a better view, I find that there is an<br />\nodd material, greasy like Vaseline on my<br />\nlenses. But the woman is so beautiful,<br />\nher gaze so radiant and direct, that I<br />\nforget. She stands on the mossy bank<br />\nholding two roses. She gives one to me as<br />\nI draw close, and I understand as if by<br />\nmagic that this is a gesture of friendship.<br />\nWe sit by the stream and talk of our<br />\nmutual respect for the sciences and<br />\nspiritual love\u2014the importance of mutual<br />\nrespect in a relationship. We write love<br />\nletters in the mud of the bank, and<br />\nsuddenly she is wearing jeans and a<br />\nfisherman's sweater. We splash each<br />\nother and sing \"Where Have All The<br /><br />\nFlowers Gone\" and other old favorites as<br />\nwe stroll hand in hand. But then my<br />\nloved one Runes to me, a little frown<br />\nplaying with her bountiful features.<br />\n\"Dear,\" she says, want you for<br />\na friend, but you're just not man enough<br />\nto be my lover.\"<br />\n\"But you're breaking rule no. 1 of<br />\nIlimsells Kindness is Kontagious Kode!\"<br />\nI say.<br />\n\"Sorry,\" she says with genuine<br />\ncompassion. \"But I won't be no ham<br />\nbovine to a manly joint such as yours!<br />\nWhy don't you try Right Place patent<br />\npending I1M12937 (see himself p. 13);<br />\nThat might up your chances a little, but<br />\nI'm not going to guarantee anything.\"<br />\nMy friends assured me that this<br />\nwas just the recurringl television dream<br />\nthat plagues all Hopkins men. They all<br />\nhave it in one form or another. So I have<br />\novercome my more immature self and<br />\nreached beyond it somehow. I went to<br />\nthe Rathskellar, that jocular meeting<br />\nground of college personalities, all radiant<br />\nand rosy checked, where one can engage<br />\nin polite conversation over a frothy mug<br />\nof brew. I was determined to find a girl<br />\nwho would look me in the eye, not the<br />\ncrotch, a girl I could warm up to, with<br />\nwhom I could exchange thoughts or<br />\njust share a private moment in silence, a<br />\ngirl with motivation, maturity,leadership<br />\nqualities, poise, charm, a Bloomingdale:s<br />\ncharge card, a rudimentary knowledge of<br />\nauto mechaniks, a mother with a Von<br />\nFurstenberg dress, a scent of Ivory soap,a<br />\nsoft hand, a shetland sweater, a warm<br />\nsmile.a father complex, an ironed shirt, a<br />\nclean face, black riding boots and a crop.<br />\nthe callypagian rondure of a Rhine<br />\nMaiden...<br />\nThat night I met Mary.

Would she feel for I<br />\nme in exactly that same special way?,Was<br />\nthis Love come to take me away on<br />\ngossamer wings? Was this an earthquake<br />\nor merely a shock? I pondered these<br />\nthings in my heart while Mary sipped her<br />\nbeer daintily through a candy striped<br />\nstraw. I wanted to...<br />\nMary: Ah Girls! I will always remember<br />\nJohn for the voluptuous sport he afforded me, shall I say the free play of the<br />\nfaculties. Was it but less fleeting! But<br />\nalas, Love, like Youth, flies with the<br />\nwings of Time's shifting sands, and<br />\nL'ennui is a snake in the lush grasses of<br />\nDesire. John was a man of contemplation<br />\nwhen first we met,his fair eyes transfixed<br />\nas if on some point far in the blue distance. Fairly a Hamlet he was,and I, his<br />\nbutterfly, Ophelia. I imagined he must be<br />\na poet, but actually he was a man- of<br />\nscience. (Though the way he scratched<br />\nhis limbs, I feared lest he had accruedthe<br />\ndropsy.) Of what thoughts he populated<br />\nthe void of his mind's cavity, I knew not,<br />\nneither did I care; I would fain speculate<br />\non the perfect volcano of smothered<br />\ndesire that surely bubbled and spewed<br /><br />\nforth the hot lava of d'amour beneath his<br />\ncool smooth brow.<br />\nI know the moment I set my<br />\ndewy eyes on the sleek line of his manly<br />\nform in that hive of, Love's pilgrims, the<br />\nRathskellar, that, indeed,he would desire<br />\na peek at my charming calf, and perhaps,<br />\nI hoped, at the divinity of my burnished<br />\nmarblelike thigh.<br />\nI approached, my<br />\nnerves all aquiver, to ask what o'clock it<br />\nmight be. With gentlemanly sobriety, he<br />\nconsulted his dial. Ah, the smooth<br />\ndelicacy of those fingers that might<br />\nfondle the poles of my panting white<br />\nglobes. Did he, in his flower of innocence, suspect my bold passion? No,<br />\nhe was far too absorbed in the furnishings<br />\nof his mind's chamber. It was for me to<br />\ndraw him out as one might the pearly<br />\ndroplet of honey from it's suckle. With<br />\npervasisve elequence, I drew his liquid<br />\neyes from that inward focus onto the<br />\nthreshold of my ruby lips and the purling<br />\ndepths of my fawn like eyes.<br />\nWe danced and I coultl sense the<br />\nsleeping giants of his biceps flexing,with<br />\nthe ghythm of the simple melody that the<br />\nminstrels played. My eyes made their<br />\nsweet pilgramage to what I imagined as<br /><br />\nthe downy concavity of his loins and, ah<br />\nbut I must quickly execute the thought<br />\nlest he think me over brazen a maid, the<br />\nseeming knot, the dart of Love,that pert<br />\nMr. Priapus, who made his dwelling in<br />\nLove's furrow there. Perhaps merely a<br />\nmodest blush would betray my rapturous<br />\nsentiments with proper poise. The music<br />\nhad become too loud for the employment<br />\nof comely forms of speech in my pursuit<br />\nof Love's fulfillment.<br />\nAnd such it was that I induced<br />\nthis reluctant Odysseus to taste of life's<br />\nrich tapestry and his body's hermit to<br />\nenter the mossy grotto between my<br />\nthighs. Alas how innocent a pupil he<br />\nwas and what trials I encountered in<br />\ntraining him to properly wield his weapon. Summarily, I would have awarded<br />\nhim an A for effort, a D for accuracy.<br />\nNevertheless, we were happy for a<br />\ntime: the pleasure of a stroll between<br />\nclasses, a warm brew at the coffee<br />\nshoppe, those evenings we read aloud- to<br />\none another until the book fell from our<br />\nblushing fingertips in a fresh onslaught of<br />\ndesire. Yet that wiley helmsman of<br />\nLove's ship desired to steer our sweet<br />\nvessel to boiling waters and rockier shores<br /><br />\nwhere we would encounter our separate<br />\ndestinies and drink the visceral draught of<br />\nloneliness. John said that I had set him<br />\npanning for that kernal of'genius at his<br />\nsoul's depth. He felt called upon to write<br />\npoetry, learn to pluck the guitar, and to<br />\nsearch for himself in that exotic land of<br />\nmany veils, The East. He left me to find<br />\nthat cocoa-skinned woman who would be<br />\nhis new guide toward Passion's hidden<br />\ntreasure. Shall I wait like Penelope for<br />\nmy sea-weary boy to return a man? Or<br />\ndoes not a brilliant new Apollo rise on<br />\nthe mind's horizon with every rosy dawn;<br />\nJohn: Mary taught me all I know of<br />\nsexual congress, and I love and respect<br />\nher for that. Sometimes I think we were<br />\ntoo passionate for this modern age we live<br />\nin. We made a chemical reaction with the<br />\npower of TNT. When I began tutoring<br />\nLing, a fellow bio major, in her English<br />\ngrammar it was too much for Mary, and<br />\nshe never forgave me for what she<br />\nimagined was a deep betrayal. I loved<br />\nMary, but sometines I'm glad we went<br />\nour separate ways.
