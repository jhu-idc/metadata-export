BERNHARD<br />\n\"Sex imagery is laid down<br />\nfrom early life onward,\"<br />\ncontended Dr. John Money,<br />\ndirector of Psychohormonal<br />\nResearch at the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, yesterday in the last<br />\nmajor lecture of the 1974 MSE<br />\nSymposium.<br />\nMoney asserted that parental<br />\npunishment and society's \"rigid<br />\ntaboos\" are the cause of sexual<br />\nabnormalities. Stressing that<br />\nperversions such as sadism,.<br />\nnymphomania, and masochism<br />\ncannot \"be learned in later life,\"<br />\nhe spoke of the \"immense\"<br />\nresponsibilities of parents, noting<br />\nthat one must \"acquaint one's<br />\nself with the facts to induce<br />\nchange.\"<br />\n\"Many societies have a taboo<br />\non sex,\" said Money. \"It's a good<br />\nthing to have a taboo on. The<br />\nfunction is to make a little child<br />\nashamed and guilty of a natural<br />\nfunction. This is an excellent<br />\nlever by which to control the<br />\nchild throughout his life.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Notice it with the politicians.<br />\nThey know this and vote 'no' on<br />\nall bills concerning sexual<br />\nliberation, often without even<br />\nreading them first. The guilt that<br />\nis instilled is excellent in<br />\nexercising power over people.\"<br />\n\"Maybe we need, a taboo,\"<br />\ncontinued Money. \"But the one<br />\nwe have is exaggerated to so great<br />\nan extent that it has lead to<br />\nsexual dysfunction.\" Concerning<br />\nhis own opinion on \"sexual<br />\ntaboo,\" Money declared, \"When<br />\na person's sexual behavior<br />\nimpinges on others, as in the case<br />\nof rape or sadistic murder, then<br />\nsociety has the right to draw the<br />\ndividing line between what is<br />\nlegal and what isn't.\"<br />\nMoney illustrated his talk with<br />\nslides of male pin-ups used by<br />\nhomosexuals, of sadistic murder<br />\nscenes taken by police files, of<br />\ntransvestites, and of special cases<br />\nof fetis hism when persons can<br />\n\"only be turned on by an<br />\namputee.\" Money explained the<br />\nlatter behavior as \"an imprint<br />\n<br />\nfrom childhood,\" when a parent<br />\nmight threaten a little boy with<br />\ncastration as a punishment for<br />\nmasturbation.<br />\nSpeaking on sadism, Money<br />\nexplained, ''Too much<br />\npunishment in childhood can<br />\noverflow into the sex attitudes of<br />\nthe child, much'as crying can also<br />\nby released in a surge of sexual<br />\nresponse.\"<br />\n\"Then punishment becomes<br />\nimprinted with sex. You cannot<br />\ndecide to change these imprints<br />\nwhenever you feel like it. But no<br />\none minds sadism in our society.<br />\nChildren grow up with violence.\"<br />\n\"Homosexuality, on the other<br />\nhand, as a condition without any<br />\nother perversions such as sadism<br />\nor a need for public exhibition,<br />\ncan be viewed like<br />\nleft-handedness. Besides,, because<br />\nwe don't know the cause, it's<br />\nsilly to pretend that we can<br />\nchange a homosexual. And if we<br />\ndecide we could, there are more<br />\nhomosexuals in America than we<br />\nhave psychoanalysts to treat<br />\n<br />\nthem,\" he stated.<br />\nMoney traced attitudes toward<br />\nsex -through history, starting with<br />\na 12th century change toward a<br />\nlove that could not be fulfilled<br />\nby intercourse, as exemplified by<br />\n\"the troubadors, the singing<br />\npoets of romantic love.\"<br />\nAnti-Science'<br />\n\"Each time sex has gone<br />\nunder, an anti-science movement<br />\ndevelop too.\"<br />\nHe noted that mankind was<br />\nnow on the verge of such a<br />\nmovement.<br />\nMoney concluded his talk with<br />\nfour ten minute pornography<br />\nfilms shown simultaneously.<br />\nThey included scenes of<br />\nhomosexual lovemaking,<br />\nheterosexual oral sex, and<br />\nconcluded in a depicted orgasm.<br />\nMoney concluded by<br />\ncongratulating. those who<br />\nremained in the audience through<br />\nthe films. \"Having the courage to<br />\nlook at the movies can help<br />\nspruce upY'citif\u2022 own sex lives..

David<br />\nBowie and I have never had<br />\nanything in common, you<br />\nunderstand. The very name has<br />\noften been enough to bring me<br />\ninto depression. Bowie, to me, was<br />\nalways symbolic of a culture that<br />\nhad reached its edges, and found<br />\nthem very ragged indeed. He<br />\ntypified a brash and gaudy<br />\ncommercialism, the pursuit of<br />\nsuccess through novelty and<br />\ndisplay rather than hard work,<br />\nskill, and perseverance. The streets<br />\nof Nashville are filled with<br />\nmusicians talented to the highest<br />\ndegree; they play in slop shops and<br />\ndown-and-outer bluegrass bars,<br />\nnever seeing the inside of record<br />\nstudio or making that first<br />\naudition. They come, they stick it<br />\nout for a while, and they find that<br />\nthere is no one around to see them,<br />\nno one who wants to see them; so<br />\nthey go. Then there is Bowie,<br />\nriding high on a wave of \"black\"<br />\nmusic (with the same connotation<br />\nas \"black\" humor), signing<br />\ncontracts left and right, making<br />\nmore money than he had ever<br />\nimagined and he did this by<br />\nexploiting everything he could, by<br />\nbeing a \"character\" rather than a<br />\nmusician, for being morbid,<br />\nmorose, and a fag. People talked<br />\nabout his show rather than his<br />\nmusic, in the same way we often<br />\njudge each other by the way we<br />\nlook rather than by what we say.<br />\nHe was an overnight success, for<br />\nbeing as outrageous and decadent<br />\nas he could be, and by covering up<br />\nthe superficialities of his music<br />\nwith a show designed to distract.<br />\nUnavoidably, a sort of cult came<br />\ninto existence, Alice Cooper and<br />\nBowie instructing, conducting, and<br />\nplaying variation after variation on<br />\nthe same absurd theme. You've<br />\nprobably turned on \"In Concert\"<br />\nat least once by accident and seen<br />\nbyproducts of all this weirdoes and<br />\nfaggots in their heyday bring a<br />\nfalse and obscene music to all, via<br />\nour friend the tube. To me it has<br />\nbeen a cause for great concern, as<br />\nthe music of a generation is<br />\ninevitably the mirror of that<br />\ngeneration.

After all, isn't<br />\nthat why Bowie is famous?

It is for me. as for many<br />\nothers, difficult to accept the<br />\nunexpected flux of a transition<br />\nlong in coming, but quick to make<br />\nits presence felt. It was so sudden,<br />\nbut a day of history...<br />\nDavid Bowie played on Monday<br />\nnight in the Capital Center at<br />\nLargo, near Washington,D.C., a<br />\nplace long despised by me for its<br />\nexorbitant ticket prices and<br />\nparking fees. It is a place of<br />\nun tethered and rampant<br />\ncapitalism, a place where David<br />\nBowie was bound to feel at home.<br />\nWhen my most inimitable and<br />\nbouyant roommates asked me to<br />\njoin them in their pilgramage I was<br />\nmore than a little surprised, as my<br />\nanimosity towards Bowie has never<br />\nbeen submerged. Should I stay<br />\nhome or go, and accept spectacle<br />\nas spectacle and raunch for<br />\nraunch? I remained undecided<br />\nuntil I saw Keith, straightforward<br />\nman-of-the -world conservativedresser type, bedecked in what was<br />\n<br />\nj u iYrg firl 4 WTT7r7T--wasproperly accentuated by a stack of -<br />\n<br />\nten or fifteen police cars lined up<br />\nthese,<br />\nnear the door..Passing<br />\n.<br />\nsomeone conjected aloud as to<br />\nwhat it would be like to be<br />\narrested wearing these<br />\ncostumes...and the faggots behind<br />\nme let it go at that. Hanging<br />\naround outside we saw the first<br />\nBowie-types of the night, we<br />\nthought. When we came closer it<br />\nwas apparent that they weren't<br />\nweird', they were just hanging<br />\naround; a bunch of blue-jeaned<br />\nlatent hippies. When we came<br />\ncloser, they stared at Keith and<br />\nasked for spare change. I had to<br />\nthink a long time before I could<br />\nremember anyone asking me for<br />\nspare change; we moved a lot faster<br />\nafter that, understandably. Keith<br />\nwas getting a little hot under the<br />\ncollar, and there were bigger<br />\nsuccesses to be found inside.<br />\nInside, moving with the crowds,<br />\nwe were disappointed. There<br />\nwasn't any costume party, and<br />\nthere weren't any monsexual<br />\ncouples cooing in the corners. Hi,<br />\nDave, how are you?

There<br />\nwasn't going to be anything weird<br />\nall night long\u2014unless Bowie could<br />\nmanage to be outlandish and foul<br />\non a stage of polished players,<br />\ncharacters, if you will.

They sang old<br />\nsoul (Supremes, Keep Me Hanging<br />\nOn) and a lot of slow, soothing<br />\nromantics which were either new,<br />\nor I just didn't recognize them.<br />\nEvery singer had a solo, the best by<br />\nthat white haired angel black<br />\nsinger.

The instruments which<br />\n<br />\nBOWIE!: A<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nfew screamsfrom the<br />\n<br />\nThere were all kinds, and we were<br />\na species ourselves, however lost<br />\nwe were in the faces and the<br />\nsmoke. Only the most typical and<br />\nweird stood out from the rest, and<br />\nit became apparent that Keith with<br />\nthe silver hair and beard, the<br />\ndefilchest and makeup face, had<br />\nnot gone far enough.<br />\nLights out. The backdrop Mike<br />\nGoddard Band fell into place, with<br />\nPaul Larson and friends now<br />\nstationed in chorus form on the<br />\nback. Bowie isn't there. They begin<br />\nto play a long instrumental, with<br />\nroom for piano and saxophone<br />\nsolos. The sound grows, and fades<br />\ninto drums duo which reaches<br />\ngreat heights. The drums stop, and<br />\nthe chorus breaks into `starship<br />\ncoming down, we're going to have<br />\nus a party tonight.' The music goes<br />\non, then stops. No lights on the<br />\nfront of the stage, and then, David<br />\nBowie, a person who obviously<br />\ncontains a many-faceted<br />\npersonality. He wore a white suit,<br />\nand had a white face. The show at<br />\nthis point had obvious, if not<br />\ntangible roots in the night-club<br />\nscene from Caba:et (starring Liza<br />\nMinelli). It didn't seem serious at<br />\nfirst, as though we had broken<br />\nfrom the first part of the show into<br />\na comedy of the absurd.<br />\nBowie began to sing then, and I<br />\nheard such old time favorites (I am<br />\ntold they are) as Rebel Rebel,<br />\nChanges, Rock and Roll Suicide,<br />\nand Suffragette City. Some of the<br />\nsongs were nice, some were o.k.,<br />\nand some were to my intense<br />\ndislike, but these things are my<br />\nown opinion and cannot reflect<br />\nwhat I consider the most<br />\nimportant aspect of the concert.<br />\nThe songs which Bowie sang were<br />\nnever weird nor did he attempt to<br />\npursue any outrageous method of<br />\nshowmanship. They were strange,<br />\nbut strange only in that their<br />\nproduction was of the type<br />\nindigenous to Las Vegas and a<br />\nnight club rather than the Capital<br />\nCenter and its tremendous crowds.<br />\nI assume that the wave which<br />\nBowie rode into fame was known<br />\nto be a short one, and his agents<br />\n(or whoever) advised him to trade<br />\nblatant novelty for a talented,<br />\npractised show.

Stand up so you can see<br />\nhim.\"<br />\n\"Okay, now, where is he?\"<br />\n\"He jsut sat down.\"<br />\nSo we sat it out, passing few<br />\namenities, and just watching,<br />\nmostly. The parade was not<br />\nendless, but there was great<br />\nvariety. We not only saw all of the<br />\nBowie addicts, but fell in love<br />\nabout eight times apiece, and saw a<br />\ngreat fight between Capital Center<br />\nfuzz and some poor delinquent. It<br />\nwas a great moving picture, not<br />\naptly described by still shots.<br />\n<br />\nvery way in which Bowie carried<br />\nhimself. It seems he strove to be<br />\naccepted as a craftsman instead of<br />\nas the image which he portrayed in<br />\nthe earlier, sideshow days.<br />\nThere was no chance to evaluate<br />\nBowie as a musician, as he played<br />\nfor only one song on the acoustic<br />\nguitar. His talent as a singer<br />\nhowever, is something which was<br />\nalways there for evaluation. He<br />\ntried to carry the show with his<br />\nvoice, and the backup groups<br />\nassumed the simplest roles of<br />\nrhythm and harmony. It is hard<br />\nhere to be objective, since as a rule<br />\nI care very little for his kind of<br />\nmusic. Let it suffice to say that his<br />\nvoice was noteworthy at times, and<br />\nas to the re3t, I'll plead ignorance.<br />\nKeith never did get picked up,<br />\nand I did get bored sometimes, but<br />\nthe guys that loved it before still<br />\nlove it now. Bowie never managed<br />\nto be weird. He was, instead, a first<br />\nclass showman. I cannot respect his<br />\nmusic for what it was, but his<br />\nattempts were powerful, and<br />\ndeserved some applause. Perhaps<br />\nten years ago we all would have<br />\nlaughed, or even thrown tomatoes.<br />\nBut we are, inevitably,a part of the<br />\nsociety which produced Bowie the<br />\nFirst. Perhaps it is \"acclimation\"<br />\nwhich helps us to accept Bowie the<br />\nSecond. The universal<br />\n\"Bisexuality\" which he was<br />\nsupposedly trying to project never<br />\ncame through to me. Anyway,<br />\nyou'll never find us holding hands.<br />\n<br />\nThE<br />\n<br />\n'NEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMarc Duvoisin, Alan Hirsch<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nLinda Joy<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\nJay Goodgold, Lainy Stephans<br />\nday editors<br />\nDante Landucci<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nRuss Smith, John Srygley<br />\nfeatures editors<br />\nAl Casale, Jeffrey Posner<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nStephen Levin, Robert Rosenwasser<br />\nsports editors<br />\nMike Bloch<br />\nphoto-production manager<br />\nClayton Buick<br />\nproduction consultant<br />\nstaff writers: Ellen Bernhard, John Bloomenthal, Bob<br />\nBuchanan, Joe Buscema, Rich D'Agostino, Bob Danner, Steven<br />\nEaddy, Sue Eyrich, Laura Feigin, Pat Flannery, Patrice<br />\nGallagher, Jan Hammerman, Leonard Levie, Michael Manes,<br />\nTom Melia, Sally Spencer, Sarah Strauss, Paula Tarnapol, John<br />\nTetzlaff, Liz Wallace.<br />\nproduction: Craig Hankin<br />\nphotographers: Gary Barg, Brian Blitz, Joachim Blunck, Arna<br />\nCohen, Joanne Silberner.<br />\nThe News-Letter is published twice each week, Tuesdays and Fridays,<br />\nduring the school year by the students of the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nHomewood Campus, Baltimore, Maryland, The News-Letter is printed at<br />\nCentaur Press, Westminster, Md.

Since the winter of 73-74<br />\nthere has been a significant turn toward<br />\nclass-wide organization which has met<br />\nwith massive political harassment. At that<br />\ntime, people working in the Committee<br />\nto Rebuild the National Welfare Rights<br />\nOrganization (CRNWRO) launched a<br />\ncampaign of employed and unemployed<br />\nto fight Work Incentive Program (WIN).<br />\nIn response, government agencies stepped<br />\nup harassment against their key<br />\norganizers in New York, Philadelphia, and<br />\nBaltimore. Children of welfare mothers in<br />\nthe Committee in Philadelphia and the<br />\nBronx were beaten up, charges of welfare<br />\nfraud were pushed and homes were<br />\nconscpicuously surveilled. In one<br />\nframe-up attempt a home was burned and<br />\nthe owners' sister, who was working with<br />\nCRNWRO, was arrested and charged with<br />\narson. This was determined to be a<br />\ncoordinated pattern of harassment aimed<br />\nat sabotaging their attempt to build a<br />\nmovement of employed and unemployed<br />\nto stop the WIN program. At that time<br />\nthe National Caucus of Labor<br />\nCommittees, the main supporter of<br />\nCRNWRO, moved to establish a new legal<br />\ndefense instituion specifically to protect<br />\nworking class organizers who are framed<br />\nor harassed for expressing and mobilizing<br />\nsupport for their political vies. However,<br />\nduring the process of building the .LODF<br />\nanacks on theworking class increased.<br />\nOne of the most blatant attacks on<br />\n<br />\npeople supporting CRNWRO was carried<br />\nout in Cincinatti against Louis Smith, the<br />\nleader of an all-black United Auto<br />\nWorkers caucus. Smith had recently<br />\nbegun working with CRNWRO and issued<br />\nstatements attacking WIN. A week later<br />\nCincinatti police illegally entered his<br />\nhouse, beat him up, and after searching<br />\nhis house and finding a gun (which he had<br />\nlegally purchased), charged him with<br />\npossession of a deadly weapon. Smith<br />\nappealed to the LODF but without<br />\nmoney it took two months to find a<br />\nlawyer who thought he could handle the<br />\ncase on his own. Due to pressures and<br />\ncomplications Louis Smith was sentenced<br />\nto a year in prison: a term which he is<br />\npresently serving. Although he is still in<br />\ntouch with the Labor Committees, it will<br />\nbe a while before he can work through<br />\nthe bitterness and fears instilled by a<br />\nconcerted effort intended to kill any<br />\nmilitant class consciousness. This case is a<br />\nconstant reminder of the need for a<br />\nstrong LODF.<br />\nIn a strikingly similar case, about two<br />\nweeks later (winter '73) the local<br />\npresident of the Baltimore meatcutters<br />\nunion, Jerry Mehapace, was framed-up on<br />\ngun charges. This occurred shortly after<br />\nhe had attacked the WIN program as a<br />\n\"racist\" and \"slave-labor)) program<br />\neffectively designed to channel black'<br />\nwelfare mothers into scab labor.<br />\nAlthough Menapace's case was clearly<br />\nillegal harassment, he was sentenced to a<br />\nyear's probation with a heavy fine.

As a new institution<br />\ndesigned and organized to serve as the<br />\nmain legal arm of these working class<br />\norganizers, the LODF will take as a<br />\nmatter of course, as resources allow, the<br />\nmost demanding and controversial<br />\npolitical cases.<br />\nThe potential of the LODF is limited<br />\nonly by the general support of the<br />\nworking class and its allies. At present the<br />\nLODF is financially destitute, but this<br />\nproblem is being creatively challenged by<br />\nserious people aware of the political<br />\nnecessity of protecting our right to freely<br />\nexpress and gain support for working<br />\nclass program and views. The<br />\nconsolidation of an associate network of<br />\nlawyers and professionals is under way in<br />\nBaltimore, throughout the East Coast and<br />\nwith a scheduled tour through the<br />\nMidwest in the next month. The<br />\nchallenge to build the LODF is great as is<br />\nits purpose, to defend these organizers,<br />\nand further, to expose and destroy the<br />\nmachinery of repression aimed at the<br />\nworking class and its allies.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nMAMA'S<br />\n36th & Keswick Rd. -- in Hampden<br />\nJust 5 blks. from campus<br />\n<br />\nLODF is now able to offer) those charges<br />\nwould probably have been dropped and a<br />\ncounter-suit filed. As in Louis Smith's<br />\ncase, the effect of this frame-up was to<br />\ndisorganize potential working class<br />\nleadership.<br />\nSuch demonstration of the need for<br />\nthe LODF goes beyond the significant<br />\nneeds of pro-working class labor leaders<br />\nand unemployed. Ghetto youths have<br />\nbeen harassed when making attempts to<br />\nbreak out of the inner city gang-hustle<br />\nlifestyle; taking classes to learn to read,<br />\nunderstand dialectical economics and<br />\nMarx, and starting to organize workers<br />\ninto a classwide movement. The intensity<br />\nof this focused harassment was sufficient,<br />\nin the absence of a strong LODF, to<br />\nequate involvement in the Revolutionary<br />\nYouth Movement (RYM)of the National<br />\nCaucus of Labor Committees (NCLC)<br />\nwith the risk of going to jail.<br />\nThe RYM-2 is a case in point, where<br />\ntwo Puerto Rican youth organizers got<br />\nmore than the usual police harassment for<br />\nRYM members. In the Spring of'73 they<br />\nwere framed-up on manslaughter charges<br />\nand assault and faced a year of<br />\ninterrogation, beatings, jail and hearings<br />\nbefore they were finally acquitted, the<br />\ndamage already done. Such treatment is<br />\ngenerally sufficient to instill a debilitating<br />\nschizophrenic state, criticallly impairing<br />\nthe human being's ability to maintain a<br />\nstable human identity and organize<br />\npolitically in the stress situations<br />\nencountered daily.

MARKS<br />\nEver wonder what a real university is<br />\nlike? Well, after two years at Hopkins, I<br />\ndecided to find out, and took my Junior<br />\nyear at the University of Arizona.<br />\nSituated about midway between Valhalla<br />\nand the Elysian Fields, the University is<br />\neasy to find\u2014if you're in Arizona, you<br />\njust take the unpaved superhighway<br />\ntowards Wickeiup, take a right at Gila<br />\nBend, and a left at Apache Junction. You<br />\nreally can't miss it.<br />\nMy first few days there, I felt a little<br />\nout of place, what with being an<br />\nultra-sophisticated Broadway bon-vivante<br />\nand all, but I gradually became<br />\naccustomed to life at UA. The girls were<br />\nall statuesque blonde goddesses with<br />\nnames like Apollonia, Vesper, and<br />\nAmphitrite (I had always wanted to meet<br />\na girl with a name like Amphitrite; it<br />\nseems like all the co-eds here are named<br />\neither Kathy or Sue...). The professors<br />\nwere all kindly old codgers, always<br />\nPrepared with an anecdote that could<br />\nrelate the synthesis of amino acids to his<br />\nfirst dog,\"Old Buck,\" who died when he<br />\nwas twelve. The Financial Aid Office<br />\nalways seemed to have too much money,<br />\nand finally had to resort to taking out ads<br />\nin the campus newspaper to get students<br />\nto take all their surplus giants. Arizona,<br />\nhowever, also had a few drawbacks, being<br />\nin a rather conservative state. For<br />\nexample, the drinking age there is 35.<br />\nAnd that's for water. the President of the<br />\nUniversity recently denounced Barry<br />\nGoldwater as a Communist. The Physics<br />\n<br />\ndepartment once tried to have the color<br />\nred banned from the spectrum. A hippie<br />\nfreak is anyone with sideburns, or<br />\nwire-rimmed glasses.

The<br />\nlengthy debates over this issue as<br />\nwell as the numerous attempts to<br />\nreopen these issues for discussion<br />\nafter approval have been two.of<br />\nthe main reasons for the<br />\nprolonging of the by-law<br />\nratification.<br />\nFink asserted that the desire<br />\nfor power on the part of certain<br />\nSAC members has been the<br />\nmotivation behind the seemingly<br />\nendless debate and has caused<br />\nfactionalization of the SAC<br />\nbody.<br />\nFink Contended that most Of<br />\nthe members who had originally<br />\nvoiced their objections have been<br />\nsatisfied with the modified<br />\nproposal., however, he said that a<br />\nhandful of students led by<br />\nDebate Club president Ed<br />\nBrokans haS persisted in voicing<br /><br />\nobjections to the by-laws.<br />\n\"Ed Brokans is doing<br />\neverything in his power to keep<br />\nthis thing going until he has in<br />\nwriting that the SAC has the final<br />\ndecision on every SAC financial<br />\ndealing that takes place,\" Fink<br />\nclaimed.<br />\nHe added that the SAC's \"not<br />\ntaking a realistic political view of<br />\nhow things on campus are,<br />\ncoupled with the incredible<br />\ndegree of groping for power\" has<br />\nbeen the cause of the ratificaiton<br />\ndelay.<br />\nConsequently, Fink projected<br />\nthat it is unlikely that the<br />\nby-laws can be ratified by the<br />\nSAC and the Student Council<br />\nbefore the end of the first<br />\nsemester.<br />\nIn addition insubstantial and<br />\nsomewhat petty issues have, on<br />\noccasion, obscured the pertinent<br />\nissues at hand and further<br />\nhindered the ratification.<br />\nWithout the by-laws and<br />\nguidelines, the SAC operates<br />\nunder last year's vague and<br /><br />\nsee SAC, page 4<br /><br />\n'I wish you every good luck.'<br /><br />\nDr. Money renounces 'rigid taboos'on sex<br />\nBy ELLEN L. BERNHARD<br />\n\"Sex imagery is laid down<br />\nfrom early life onward,\"<br />\ncontended Dr. John Money,<br />\ndirector of Psychohormonal<br />\nResearch at the Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, yesterday in the last<br />\nmajor lecture of the 1974 MSE<br />\nSymposium.<br />\nMoney asserted that parental<br />\npunishment and society's \"rigid<br />\ntaboos\" are the cause of sexual<br />\nabnormalities. Stressing that<br />\nperversions such as sadism,.<br />\nnymphomania, and masochism<br />\ncannot \"be learned in later life,\"<br />\nhe spoke of the \"immense\"<br />\nresponsibilities of parents, noting<br />\nthat one must \"acquaint one's<br />\nself with the facts to induce<br />\nchange.\"<br />\n\"Many societies have a taboo<br />\non sex,\" said Money. \"It's a good<br />\nthing to have a taboo on. The<br />\nfunction is to make a little child<br />\nashamed and guilty of a natural<br />\nfunction. This is an excellent<br />\nlever by which to control the<br />\nchild throughout his life.\"<br /><br />\n\"Notice it with the politicians.<br />\nThey know this and vote 'no' on<br />\nall bills concerning sexual<br />\nliberation, often without even<br />\nreading them first. The guilt that<br />\nis instilled is excellent in<br />\nexercising power over people.\"<br />\n\"Maybe we need, a taboo,\"<br />\ncontinued Money. \"But the one<br />\nwe have is exaggerated to so great<br />\nan extent that it has lead to<br />\nsexual dysfunction.\" Concerning<br />\nhis own opinion on \"sexual<br />\ntaboo,\" Money declared, \"When<br />\na person's sexual behavior<br />\nimpinges on others, as in the case<br />\nof rape or sadistic murder, then<br />\nsociety has the right to draw the<br />\ndividing line between what is<br />\nlegal and what isn't.\"<br />\nMoney illustrated his talk with<br />\nslides of male pin-ups used by<br />\nhomosexuals, of sadistic murder<br />\nscenes taken by police files, of<br />\ntransvestites, and of special cases<br />\nof fetis hism when persons can<br />\n\"only be turned on by an<br />\namputee.\" Money explained the<br />\nlatter behavior as \"an imprint<br /><br />\nfrom childhood,\" when a parent<br />\nmight threaten a little boy with<br />\ncastration as a punishment for<br />\nmasturbation.<br />\nSpeaking on sadism, Money<br />\nexplained, ''Too much<br />\npunishment in childhood can<br />\noverflow into the sex attitudes of<br />\nthe child, much'as crying can also<br />\nby released in a surge of sexual<br />\nresponse.\"<br />\n\"Then punishment becomes<br />\nimprinted with sex. You cannot<br />\ndecide to change these imprints<br />\nwhenever you feel like it. But no<br />\none minds sadism in our society.<br />\nChildren grow up with violence.\"<br />\n\"Homosexuality, on the other<br />\nhand, as a condition without any<br />\nother perversions such as sadism<br />\nor a need for public exhibition,<br />\ncan be viewed like<br />\nleft-handedness. Besides,, because<br />\nwe don't know the cause, it's<br />\nsilly to pretend that we can<br />\nchange a homosexual. And if we<br />\ndecide we could, there are more<br />\nhomosexuals in America than we<br />\nhave psychoanalysts to treat<br /><br />\nthem,\" he stated.<br />\nMoney traced attitudes toward<br />\nsex -through history, starting with<br />\na 12th century change toward a<br />\nlove that could not be fulfilled<br />\nby intercourse, as exemplified by<br />\n\"the troubadors, the singing<br />\npoets of romantic love.\"<br />\nAnti-Science'<br />\n\"Each time sex has gone<br />\nunder, an anti-science movement<br />\ndevelop too.\"<br />\nHe noted that mankind was<br />\nnow on the verge of such a<br />\nmovement.<br />\nMoney concluded his talk with<br />\nfour ten minute pornography<br />\nfilms shown simultaneously.<br />\nThey included scenes of<br />\nhomosexual lovemaking,<br />\nheterosexual oral sex, and<br />\nconcluded in a depicted orgasm.<br />\nMoney concluded by<br />\ncongratulating. those who<br />\nremained in the audience through<br />\nthe films. \"Having the courage to<br />\nlook at the movies can help<br />\nspruce upY'citif\u2022 own sex lives..

David<br />\nBowie and I have never had<br />\nanything in common, you<br />\nunderstand. The very name has<br />\noften been enough to bring me<br />\ninto depression. Bowie, to me, was<br />\nalways symbolic of a culture that<br />\nhad reached its edges, and found<br />\nthem very ragged indeed. He<br />\ntypified a brash and gaudy<br />\ncommercialism, the pursuit of<br />\nsuccess through novelty and<br />\ndisplay rather than hard work,<br />\nskill, and perseverance. The streets<br />\nof Nashville are filled with<br />\nmusicians talented to the highest<br />\ndegree; they play in slop shops and<br />\ndown-and-outer bluegrass bars,<br />\nnever seeing the inside of record<br />\nstudio or making that first<br />\naudition. They come, they stick it<br />\nout for a while, and they find that<br />\nthere is no one around to see them,<br />\nno one who wants to see them; so<br />\nthey go. Then there is Bowie,<br />\nriding high on a wave of \"black\"<br />\nmusic (with the same connotation<br />\nas \"black\" humor), signing<br />\ncontracts left and right, making<br />\nmore money than he had ever<br />\nimagined and he did this by<br />\nexploiting everything he could, by<br />\nbeing a \"character\" rather than a<br />\nmusician, for being morbid,<br />\nmorose, and a fag. People talked<br />\nabout his show rather than his<br />\nmusic, in the same way we often<br />\njudge each other by the way we<br />\nlook rather than by what we say.<br />\nHe was an overnight success, for<br />\nbeing as outrageous and decadent<br />\nas he could be, and by covering up<br />\nthe superficialities of his music<br />\nwith a show designed to distract.<br />\nUnavoidably, a sort of cult came<br />\ninto existence, Alice Cooper and<br />\nBowie instructing, conducting, and<br />\nplaying variation after variation on<br />\nthe same absurd theme. You've<br />\nprobably turned on \"In Concert\"<br />\nat least once by accident and seen<br />\nbyproducts of all this weirdoes and<br />\nfaggots in their heyday bring a<br />\nfalse and obscene music to all, via<br />\nour friend the tube.

They were<br />\ngoing to Bowie's show knowing<br />\nthat it would be good, because<br />\nthey had their own show. It was a<br />\nshow within a show within a show,<br />\nand they meant to get picked up<br />\nby the real faggots, the diehard<br />\nwierdos that would be everywhere<br />\nat a Bowie concert. After all, isn't<br />\nthat why Bowie is famous? He<br />\nattracts, the perverted denizens<br />\nfrom the shadows, brings them<br />\nout, relates to them, makes them<br />\nfeel at home. and lets the rest of<br />\nthe world view on them in a<br />\nhabitat as natural as any that we<br />\nwould venture into. Words fail me<br />\nhere, as I attempt to describe the<br />\necstasy which I felt as I thought of<br />\ntrailing my frazzled friends to this<br />\nconcert.

It is for me. as for many<br />\nothers, difficult to accept the<br />\nunexpected flux of a transition<br />\nlong in coming, but quick to make<br />\nits presence felt. It was so sudden,<br />\nbut a day of history...<br />\nDavid Bowie played on Monday<br />\nnight in the Capital Center at<br />\nLargo, near Washington,D.C., a<br />\nplace long despised by me for its<br />\nexorbitant ticket prices and<br />\nparking fees. It is a place of<br />\nun tethered and rampant<br />\ncapitalism, a place where David<br />\nBowie was bound to feel at home.<br />\nWhen my most inimitable and<br />\nbouyant roommates asked me to<br />\njoin them in their pilgramage I was<br />\nmore than a little surprised, as my<br />\nanimosity towards Bowie has never<br />\nbeen submerged. Should I stay<br />\nhome or go, and accept spectacle<br />\nas spectacle and raunch for<br />\nraunch? I remained undecided<br />\nuntil I saw Keith, straightforward<br />\nman-of-the -world conservativedresser type, bedecked in what was<br /><br />\nj u iYrg firl 4 WTT7r7T--wasproperly accentuated by a stack of -<br /><br />\nten or fifteen police cars lined up<br />\nthese,<br />\nnear the door..Passing<br />\n.<br />\nsomeone conjected aloud as to<br />\nwhat it would be like to be<br />\narrested wearing these<br />\ncostumes...and the faggots behind<br />\nme let it go at that. Hanging<br />\naround outside we saw the first<br />\nBowie-types of the night, we<br />\nthought. When we came closer it<br />\nwas apparent that they weren't<br />\nweird', they were just hanging<br />\naround; a bunch of blue-jeaned<br />\nlatent hippies. When we came<br />\ncloser, they stared at Keith and<br />\nasked for spare change. I had to<br />\nthink a long time before I could<br />\nremember anyone asking me for<br />\nspare change; we moved a lot faster<br />\nafter that, understandably. Keith<br />\nwas getting a little hot under the<br />\ncollar, and there were bigger<br />\nsuccesses to be found inside.<br />\nInside, moving with the crowds,<br />\nwe were disappointed. There<br />\nwasn't any costume party, and<br />\nthere weren't any monsexual<br />\ncouples cooing in the corners. Hi,<br />\nDave, how are you? Seen Rhonda?<br />\nBlue jeans and sweater, high heels<br />\nand hats.

And then we realize Keith<br />\nhas taken himself out of context<br />\nand become a happily cruisin'<br /><br />\nthey played were shiny, the piano<br />\nwas white. They wore clothes like<br />\ncostumes, but they were elegant<br />\nand not weird. Not weird! I was<br />\nshocked, and to tell you now that<br />\nthis was Bowie's backup band will<br />\nimplement my point later. There<br />\nwasn't going to be anything weird<br />\nall night long\u2014unless Bowie could<br />\nmanage to be outlandish and foul<br />\non a stage of polished players,<br />\ncharacters, if you will. It was like<br />\ngreat nightclub entertainment.The<br />\nsingers made their renditions with<br />\na Hello Dolly!\u2014Broadway style,<br />\nwhich was interestingly innovative<br />\nbecause their material was<br />\npredominantly black (heritage this<br />\ntime, not humor). They sang old<br />\nsoul (Supremes, Keep Me Hanging<br />\nOn) and a lot of slow, soothing<br />\nromantics which were either new,<br />\nor I just didn't recognize them.<br />\nEvery singer had a solo, the best by<br />\nthat white haired angel black<br />\nsinger.

Mike Goddard on the<br />\nelectric piano and organ, his<br />\nplayers on the saxophone, two<br />\ndrums, lead guitar, rhythm, and<br />\nbass; all were persistently<br />\nexcellent. The instruments which<br /><br />\nBOWIE!: A<br />\nV<br /><br />\nfew screamsfrom the<br /><br />\nThere were all kinds, and we were<br />\na species ourselves, however lost<br />\nwe were in the faces and the<br />\nsmoke. Only the most typical and<br />\nweird stood out from the rest, and<br />\nit became apparent that Keith with<br />\nthe silver hair and beard, the<br />\ndefilchest and makeup face, had<br />\nnot gone far enough.<br />\nLights out. The backdrop Mike<br />\nGoddard Band fell into place, with<br />\nPaul Larson and friends now<br />\nstationed in chorus form on the<br />\nback. Bowie isn't there. They begin<br />\nto play a long instrumental, with<br />\nroom for piano and saxophone<br />\nsolos. The sound grows, and fades<br />\ninto drums duo which reaches<br />\ngreat heights. The drums stop, and<br />\nthe chorus breaks into `starship<br />\ncoming down, we're going to have<br />\nus a party tonight.' The music goes<br />\non, then stops. No lights on the<br />\nfront of the stage, and then, David<br />\nBowie, a person who obviously<br />\ncontains a many-faceted<br />\npersonality. He wore a white suit,<br />\nand had a white face. The show at<br />\nthis point had obvious, if not<br />\ntangible roots in the night-club<br />\nscene from Caba:et (starring Liza<br />\nMinelli). It didn't seem serious at<br />\nfirst, as though we had broken<br />\nfrom the first part of the show into<br />\na comedy of the absurd.<br />\nBowie began to sing then, and I<br />\nheard such old time favorites (I am<br />\ntold they are) as Rebel Rebel,<br />\nChanges, Rock and Roll Suicide,<br />\nand Suffragette City. Some of the<br />\nsongs were nice, some were o.k.,<br />\nand some were to my intense<br />\ndislike, but these things are my<br />\nown opinion and cannot reflect<br />\nwhat I consider the most<br />\nimportant aspect of the concert.<br />\nThe songs which Bowie sang were<br />\nnever weird nor did he attempt to<br />\npursue any outrageous method of<br />\nshowmanship. They were strange,<br />\nbut strange only in that their<br />\nproduction was of the type<br />\nindigenous to Las Vegas and a<br />\nnight club rather than the Capital<br />\nCenter and its tremendous crowds.<br />\nI assume that the wave which<br />\nBowie rode into fame was known<br />\nto be a short one, and his agents<br />\n(or whoever) advised him to trade<br />\nblatant novelty for a talented,<br />\npractised show. This entailed a<br />\nchange in music, and a change in<br />\nrs<br /><br />\n1<br />\n.V.-+,<br />\nw% \u2022-\u2022 Cin, or got up and milled about. We<br />\nsaw lots of potential companions<br /><br />\nsang \"Knock on Wood\" Of Wns.,,,<br />\nPickett fame, and the latter by the<br /><br />\nfor Keith, as some were prone to<br />\nstrutting. It seems that you were<br />\neither not there at all, or<br />\nsomewhere in-between. Those who<br />\nstrutted wore abundant silver and<br />\nblack, they wore thick makeup,<br />\nand sometimes painted their entire<br />\nfaces. There weren't many,<br />\nhowever, at least not as many as<br />\nwe had expected, and this is what<br />\ngave them the aura of the diehard.<br />\nThere was evidence of humanity<br />\nright behind us, for instance, and<br />\nI've taken great pains to restore the<br />\nconversation verbatim...<br />\n\"Hey man, there's Bob!\"<br />\n\"Where?\"<br />\n\"Over there in front of the girl<br />\nwith the silver face.\"<br />\n\"Where?\"<br />\n\"Just going up the aisle. Now<br />\nhe's standing next to the fat guy.\"<br />\n\"Man, that's way over there. I<br />\ncan't see that far, I'm too wasted.\"<br />\n\"Oh, c'mon man, he's right over<br />\nthere. Stand up so you can see<br />\nhim.\"<br />\n\"Okay, now, where is he?\"<br />\n\"He jsut sat down.\"<br />\nSo we sat it out, passing few<br />\namenities, and just watching,<br />\nmostly. The parade was not<br />\nendless, but there was great<br />\nvariety. We not only saw all of the<br />\nBowie addicts, but fell in love<br />\nabout eight times apiece, and saw a<br />\ngreat fight between Capital Center<br />\nfuzz and some poor delinquent. It<br />\nwas a great moving picture, not<br />\naptly described by still shots.<br /><br />\nvery way in which Bowie carried<br />\nhimself. It seems he strove to be<br />\naccepted as a craftsman instead of<br />\nas the image which he portrayed in<br />\nthe earlier, sideshow days.<br />\nThere was no chance to evaluate<br />\nBowie as a musician, as he played<br />\nfor only one song on the acoustic<br />\nguitar. His talent as a singer<br />\nhowever, is something which was<br />\nalways there for evaluation. He<br />\ntried to carry the show with his<br />\nvoice, and the backup groups<br />\nassumed the simplest roles of<br />\nrhythm and harmony. It is hard<br />\nhere to be objective, since as a rule<br />\nI care very little for his kind of<br />\nmusic. Let it suffice to say that his<br />\nvoice was noteworthy at times, and<br />\nas to the re3t, I'll plead ignorance.<br />\nKeith never did get picked up,<br />\nand I did get bored sometimes, but<br />\nthe guys that loved it before still<br />\nlove it now. Bowie never managed<br />\nto be weird. He was, instead, a first<br />\nclass showman. I cannot respect his<br />\nmusic for what it was, but his<br />\nattempts were powerful, and<br />\ndeserved some applause. Perhaps<br />\nten years ago we all would have<br />\nlaughed, or even thrown tomatoes.<br />\nBut we are, inevitably,a part of the<br />\nsociety which produced Bowie the<br />\nFirst. Perhaps it is \"acclimation\"<br />\nwhich helps us to accept Bowie the<br />\nSecond. The universal<br />\n\"Bisexuality\" which he was<br />\nsupposedly trying to project never<br />\ncame through to me.

Since the winter of 73-74<br />\nthere has been a significant turn toward<br />\nclass-wide organization which has met<br />\nwith massive political harassment. At that<br />\ntime, people working in the Committee<br />\nto Rebuild the National Welfare Rights<br />\nOrganization (CRNWRO) launched a<br />\ncampaign of employed and unemployed<br />\nto fight Work Incentive Program (WIN).<br />\nIn response, government agencies stepped<br />\nup harassment against their key<br />\norganizers in New York, Philadelphia, and<br />\nBaltimore. Children of welfare mothers in<br />\nthe Committee in Philadelphia and the<br />\nBronx were beaten up, charges of welfare<br />\nfraud were pushed and homes were<br />\nconscpicuously surveilled. In one<br />\nframe-up attempt a home was burned and<br />\nthe owners' sister, who was working with<br />\nCRNWRO, was arrested and charged with<br />\narson. This was determined to be a<br />\ncoordinated pattern of harassment aimed<br />\nat sabotaging their attempt to build a<br />\nmovement of employed and unemployed<br />\nto stop the WIN program. At that time<br />\nthe National Caucus of Labor<br />\nCommittees, the main supporter of<br />\nCRNWRO, moved to establish a new legal<br />\ndefense instituion specifically to protect<br />\nworking class organizers who are framed<br />\nor harassed for expressing and mobilizing<br />\nsupport for their political vies. However,<br />\nduring the process of building the .LODF<br />\nanacks on theworking class increased.<br />\nOne of the most blatant attacks on<br /><br />\npeople supporting CRNWRO was carried<br />\nout in Cincinatti against Louis Smith, the<br />\nleader of an all-black United Auto<br />\nWorkers caucus. Smith had recently<br />\nbegun working with CRNWRO and issued<br />\nstatements attacking WIN. A week later<br />\nCincinatti police illegally entered his<br />\nhouse, beat him up, and after searching<br />\nhis house and finding a gun (which he had<br />\nlegally purchased), charged him with<br />\npossession of a deadly weapon. Smith<br />\nappealed to the LODF but without<br />\nmoney it took two months to find a<br />\nlawyer who thought he could handle the<br />\ncase on his own. Due to pressures and<br />\ncomplications Louis Smith was sentenced<br />\nto a year in prison: a term which he is<br />\npresently serving. Although he is still in<br />\ntouch with the Labor Committees, it will<br />\nbe a while before he can work through<br />\nthe bitterness and fears instilled by a<br />\nconcerted effort intended to kill any<br />\nmilitant class consciousness. This case is a<br />\nconstant reminder of the need for a<br />\nstrong LODF.<br />\nIn a strikingly similar case, about two<br />\nweeks later (winter '73) the local<br />\npresident of the Baltimore meatcutters<br />\nunion, Jerry Mehapace, was framed-up on<br />\ngun charges. This occurred shortly after<br />\nhe had attacked the WIN program as a<br />\n\"racist\" and \"slave-labor)) program<br />\neffectively designed to channel black'<br />\nwelfare mothers into scab labor.<br />\nAlthough Menapace's case was clearly<br />\nillegal harassment, he was sentenced to a<br />\nyear's probation with a heavy fine.

As a new institution<br />\ndesigned and organized to serve as the<br />\nmain legal arm of these working class<br />\norganizers, the LODF will take as a<br />\nmatter of course, as resources allow, the<br />\nmost demanding and controversial<br />\npolitical cases.<br />\nThe potential of the LODF is limited<br />\nonly by the general support of the<br />\nworking class and its allies. At present the<br />\nLODF is financially destitute, but this<br />\nproblem is being creatively challenged by<br />\nserious people aware of the political<br />\nnecessity of protecting our right to freely<br />\nexpress and gain support for working<br />\nclass program and views. The<br />\nconsolidation of an associate network of<br />\nlawyers and professionals is under way in<br />\nBaltimore, throughout the East Coast and<br />\nwith a scheduled tour through the<br />\nMidwest in the next month. The<br />\nchallenge to build the LODF is great as is<br />\nits purpose, to defend these organizers,<br />\nand further, to expose and destroy the<br />\nmachinery of repression aimed at the<br />\nworking class and its allies.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nMAMA'S<br />\n36th &amp; Keswick Rd. -- in Hampden<br />\nJust 5 blks. from campus<br /><br />\nLODF is now able to offer) those charges<br />\nwould probably have been dropped and a<br />\ncounter-suit filed. As in Louis Smith's<br />\ncase, the effect of this frame-up was to<br />\ndisorganize potential working class<br />\nleadership.<br />\nSuch demonstration of the need for<br />\nthe LODF goes beyond the significant<br />\nneeds of pro-working class labor leaders<br />\nand unemployed. Ghetto youths have<br />\nbeen harassed when making attempts to<br />\nbreak out of the inner city gang-hustle<br />\nlifestyle; taking classes to learn to read,<br />\nunderstand dialectical economics and<br />\nMarx, and starting to organize workers<br />\ninto a classwide movement. The intensity<br />\nof this focused harassment was sufficient,<br />\nin the absence of a strong LODF, to<br />\nequate involvement in the Revolutionary<br />\nYouth Movement (RYM)of the National<br />\nCaucus of Labor Committees (NCLC)<br />\nwith the risk of going to jail.<br />\nThe RYM-2 is a case in point, where<br />\ntwo Puerto Rican youth organizers got<br />\nmore than the usual police harassment for<br />\nRYM members. In the Spring of'73 they<br />\nwere framed-up on manslaughter charges<br />\nand assault and faced a year of<br />\ninterrogation, beatings, jail and hearings<br />\nbefore they were finally acquitted, the<br />\ndamage already done. Such treatment is<br />\ngenerally sufficient to instill a debilitating<br />\nschizophrenic state, criticallly impairing<br />\nthe human being's ability to maintain a<br />\nstable human identity and organize<br />\npolitically in the stress situations<br />\nencountered daily.

MARKS<br />\nEver wonder what a real university is<br />\nlike? Well, after two years at Hopkins, I<br />\ndecided to find out, and took my Junior<br />\nyear at the University of Arizona.<br />\nSituated about midway between Valhalla<br />\nand the Elysian Fields, the University is<br />\neasy to find\u2014if you're in Arizona, you<br />\njust take the unpaved superhighway<br />\ntowards Wickeiup, take a right at Gila<br />\nBend, and a left at Apache Junction. You<br />\nreally can't miss it.<br />\nMy first few days there, I felt a little<br />\nout of place, what with being an<br />\nultra-sophisticated Broadway bon-vivante<br />\nand all, but I gradually became<br />\naccustomed to life at UA. The girls were<br />\nall statuesque blonde goddesses with<br />\nnames like Apollonia, Vesper, and<br />\nAmphitrite (I had always wanted to meet<br />\na girl with a name like Amphitrite; it<br />\nseems like all the co-eds here are named<br />\neither Kathy or Sue...). The professors<br />\nwere all kindly old codgers, always<br />\nPrepared with an anecdote that could<br />\nrelate the synthesis of amino acids to his<br />\nfirst dog,\"Old Buck,\" who died when he<br />\nwas twelve. The Financial Aid Office<br />\nalways seemed to have too much money,<br />\nand finally had to resort to taking out ads<br />\nin the campus newspaper to get students<br />\nto take all their surplus giants. Arizona,<br />\nhowever, also had a few drawbacks, being<br />\nin a rather conservative state. For<br />\nexample, the drinking age there is 35.<br />\nAnd that's for water. the President of the<br />\nUniversity recently denounced Barry<br />\nGoldwater as a Communist. The Physics<br /><br />\ndepartment once tried to have the color<br />\nred banned from the spectrum. A hippie<br />\nfreak is anyone with sideburns, or<br />\nwire-rimmed glasses. A graduate student<br />\nis anyone with both.<br />\nAdditionally, sooner or later or e gets<br />\ntired of being served ambrosia in the<br />\ncafeteria (even if it was only Mondays<br />\nand Fridays- the rest of the week we had<br />\nto settle on a diet of nectar and manna.)<br />\nOne also begins to feel guilty about<br />\ngetting a 4.0 despite attending wild<br />\nparties being thrown every night. You<br />\nknow the kind of parties\u2014where the head<br />\ncheerleader strips, and swings naked from<br />\na chandelier, while everyone drinks<br />\nchampagne out of ladies' slippers. But<br />\nafter a while, it does get tedious, and I<br />\nresolved to return to Hopkins to get my<br />\ndegree, though harboring in the back of<br />\nmy mind, images of Sue or Kathy<br />\nswinging from one of the chandeliers in<br />\nthe Gilman Coffee House, as all the<br />\nfun-loving Hopkins students mill around,<br />\nsipping National Bo out of Converse<br />\nAll-Stars.<br />\nHurricane<br />\nThe night before I returned to<br />\nHopkins, in anxious anticipation, I<br />\nreflected back on my Sophomore year,<br />\nwhen I roomed with a pre-med larynx<br />\nnamed \"Hurricane\" Marshall, an<br />\nalligator-wresiler front he urban sector of<br />\nthe Okeefenokee swamp.
