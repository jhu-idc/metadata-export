Well<br />\nsir, when you encounter this dilemma, the best- thing to<br />\ndo is seize it by the horns. Ask yourself this question: Does<br />\nhe truly have everything? Does he, for example, have a<br />\nbirthmark? A Mach number? A lacrosse net? An I-beam?<br />\nAn S-hook? A U-bolt? A T-square? A Primus stove?<br />\n(There is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story<br />\nabout how Primuscame to invent the stove. Before Primus's<br />\ninvention, cooking was rather a hazardous occupation.<br />\nPeople just built fires any old place\u2014the floor, the closet,<br />\n\u2022 the escritoire\u2014and often as not the whole house would go<br />\nup in flames along with the dinner. Primus, a goose<br />\nplucker of Frankfurt-am-Main, kept thinking there must<br />\nbe a more efficient way to cook. Finally, in a flash of inspiration,it came to him:Why not build a device to contain<br />\nthe fire and keep it from spreading?<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n711t6tikeiv,i9 kilitzt adai<br />\n<br />\n(Well sir, he built precisely such a device and named it<br />\nafter his beloved wife Stove. Primus's first Stove, it must<br />\nbe confessed, was less than a triumph; his mistake was in<br />\nbuilding it out of paper. The next Stove, built of wood,<br />\nfared hardly better. Not until he made one out of metal<br />\ncould the Stove really be called a success.<br />\n(But even then the Stove was not entirely satisfactory.<br />\nThe trouble was that the Stove filled up with ashes and<br />\nbecame useless after a few weeks. It remained for Primus's<br />\nson Frederick to conquer that problem. He invented a<br />\nmechanism to remove ashes from the bottom of the Stove<br />\nand was -thenceforth -known to posterity as Frederick the<br />\nGrate.)<br />\nBut I digress. We were discussing Christmas gifts. This<br />\nyear, as every year, a popular gift is the smoking jacket.<br />\nAnd what do the smoking jackets smoke? Why, Marlboro,<br />\nof course\u2014every man jacket of them. And why wouldn't<br />\nthey smoke Marlboros? Why wouldn't anybody with a<br />\ntaste bud in his head? You get such'a lot to like in a Marlboro\u2014filter ... flavor ...flip-top box.<br />\nHere is no filter to hollow the cheeks and bug the eyel<br />\nballs; here is a filter that draws nice and easy. Ifere is no<br />\nflavor to pale and pall; here is a flavor ever fresh, ever<br />\nzestful. Here is no flimsy pack to crumble and shred its<br />\nprecious cargo; here is a sturdy box that keeps each cigarette plump and pristine.<br />\nSpeaking of smoking, the year's most unusual gift item<br />\nis a brand-new cigarette lighter that never needs refilling.<br />\nYou are scoffing. You are saying you have heard such claims<br />\nbefore. But it's true, I promise you. This new lighter<br />\nnever, never needs refilling! The fuel supply lasts forever.<br />\nOf course, there are certain _disadvantages. For one<br />\nthing, the lighter is rather bulky-170 feet long and three<br />\nstories high.<br />\nBut look on the bright side: As the fuel runs out, you<br />\ncan rent rooms in it.<br />\nShulman<br />\n05<br />\n<br />\nPAGE THIRTEEN<br />\n<br />\nDribblers Meet<br />\nGarnef Five<br />\n. 1<br />\nTomorrow Nkte<br />\nBy MIKE KAPPY<br />\nCoach Ross Sachs will pull<br />\nthe wraps off the 1957-58 Hopkins varsity hoopsters tomorrow<br />\nBy STAN HANDMAKER<br />\nnight at Swarthmore College.<br />\nSports Editor<br />\nThe new squad is thirteen deep,<br />\nwith one senior, seven juniors,<br />\nBefore giving full attention in the sports columns<br />\nand five sophomores, which of our gazette to swordsmanship, grappling, and<br />\nDr.<br />\nwould seem to indicate the re- Naismith's invention,<br />\nwe cast a brief backward glance<br />\nturn of most of the squad next<br />\nover the fall sports scene at the Homewood.<br />\nseason.<br />\n3-2-2 is the mark left by the 1957 edition of the Jay<br />\nReturnees Deep<br />\ngridiron<br />\ncrew.

Well<br />\nsir, when you encounter this dilemma, the best- thing to<br />\ndo is seize it by the horns. Ask yourself this question: Does<br />\nhe truly have everything? Does he, for example, have a<br />\nbirthmark? A Mach number? A lacrosse net? An I-beam?<br />\nAn S-hook? A U-bolt? A T-square? A Primus stove?<br />\n(There is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story<br />\nabout how Primuscame to invent the stove. Before Primus's<br />\ninvention, cooking was rather a hazardous occupation.<br />\nPeople just built fires any old place\u2014the floor, the closet,<br />\n\u2022 the escritoire\u2014and often as not the whole house would go<br />\nup in flames along with the dinner. Primus, a goose<br />\nplucker of Frankfurt-am-Main, kept thinking there must<br />\nbe a more efficient way to cook. Finally, in a flash of inspiration,it came to him:Why not build a device to contain<br />\nthe fire and keep it from spreading?<br /><br />\nIt<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n711t6tikeiv,i9 kilitzt adai<br /><br />\n(Well sir, he built precisely such a device and named it<br />\nafter his beloved wife Stove. Primus's first Stove, it must<br />\nbe confessed, was less than a triumph; his mistake was in<br />\nbuilding it out of paper. The next Stove, built of wood,<br />\nfared hardly better. Not until he made one out of metal<br />\ncould the Stove really be called a success.<br />\n(But even then the Stove was not entirely satisfactory.<br />\nThe trouble was that the Stove filled up with ashes and<br />\nbecame useless after a few weeks. It remained for Primus's<br />\nson Frederick to conquer that problem. He invented a<br />\nmechanism to remove ashes from the bottom of the Stove<br />\nand was -thenceforth -known to posterity as Frederick the<br />\nGrate.)<br />\nBut I digress. We were discussing Christmas gifts. This<br />\nyear, as every year, a popular gift is the smoking jacket.<br />\nAnd what do the smoking jackets smoke? Why, Marlboro,<br />\nof course\u2014every man jacket of them. And why wouldn't<br />\nthey smoke Marlboros? Why wouldn't anybody with a<br />\ntaste bud in his head?

Here is no flimsy pack to crumble and shred its<br />\nprecious cargo; here is a sturdy box that keeps each cigarette plump and pristine.<br />\nSpeaking of smoking, the year's most unusual gift item<br />\nis a brand-new cigarette lighter that never needs refilling.<br />\nYou are scoffing. You are saying you have heard such claims<br />\nbefore. But it's true, I promise you. This new lighter<br />\nnever, never needs refilling!
