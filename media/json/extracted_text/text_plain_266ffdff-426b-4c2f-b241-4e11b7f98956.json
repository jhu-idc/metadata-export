The Maryland football game, notable track successes and<br />\nother things have succeeded in transforming many citizens from<br />\nmere Baltimoreans to actual Hopkinsites. Hopkins does not yet<br />\nmean as much to Baltimore as Harvard means to Boston or the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania means to Philadelphia. The inhabitants<br />\nof the Monumental City, however, are beginning to realize that they<br />\nhave a great University in their midst.<br />\nHopkins must soon capitalize on this realization. The end of<br />\nthis month marks the opening of the spring sport schedule. In order to carry out this schedule and to pay the guarantees it will necessitate, the athletic authorities must dispose of a large number of<br />\nseason tickets. The plan of campaign will be practically the same<br />\nas last year. The students will be formed into teams, competition<br />\nwill be held, and valuable prizes will be awarded to the group and<br />\nthe individual with the largest number of sales. This spring, however, the salesmen will have a more interested and more sympathetic<br />\ncitizenry to deal with.<br />\nOur track team is famous throughout the country; lacrosse has<br />\ngrown in popularity by leaps and bounds; the nine promises to be the<br />\nbest in years; the citizens of Baltimore are interested.

The Maryland football game, notable track successes and<br />\nother things have succeeded in transforming many citizens from<br />\nmere Baltimoreans to actual Hopkinsites. Hopkins does not yet<br />\nmean as much to Baltimore as Harvard means to Boston or the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania means to Philadelphia. The inhabitants<br />\nof the Monumental City, however, are beginning to realize that they<br />\nhave a great University in their midst.<br />\nHopkins must soon capitalize on this realization. The end of<br />\nthis month marks the opening of the spring sport schedule. In order to carry out this schedule and to pay the guarantees it will necessitate, the athletic authorities must dispose of a large number of<br />\nseason tickets. The plan of campaign will be practically the same<br />\nas last year. The students will be formed into teams, competition<br />\nwill be held, and valuable prizes will be awarded to the group and<br />\nthe individual with the largest number of sales.
