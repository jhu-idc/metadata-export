The<br />\nMarylanders won, compiling 491<br />\n/<br />\n4<br />\npoints, while the Hopkins teams<br />\nplaced second and fourth, with 43%<br />\nand 14 points respectively.<br />\nCoach John Bridgers,' stating<br />\nthat \"the teams did as well as was<br />\nexpected,\" was rather pleased, and<br />\neven elated, over the showings of<br />\na few Jay men. Al Hlavin, varsity<br />\nco-captain, whom the coach singled<br />\nout as \"our probable high-scorer<br />\nfor the season,\" ran three fine<br />\nraces. He won the low hurdles from<br />\na Towson boy who placed fourth<br />\nin the Mason-Dixon finals in 1954,<br />\ncopped a second in the high hurdles<br />\nand a third in the broad jump,<br />\ncompiling 10 points.<br />\nSam Wright, who took top honors in the 330, fourth in the shotput, and another fourth in the<br />\n220, and Jim Love, who won both<br />\nthe shot and discus, were other<br />\nJHU standouts. Led by Love, who<br />\n<br />\nBilgrav's Blue Jays<br />\nMeet Mules Today<br />\nTeam Still Unsettled<br />\nWith one regularly scheduled<br />\ngame under its belts, the Blue Jay<br />\nVarsity baseball team takes on<br />\nMuhlenburg today in a practice<br />\ngame at Hopkins.<br />\nYesterday the \u201eJays opened their<br />\nregular season by playing Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br />\nat Hopkins. The touring MIT nine<br />\nwas an unknown. quantity to Bob<br />\nBilgrav, the JHU mentor, and he<br />\nhad to send his team into the contest with a minimum of practice.<br />\nThe Jays had played only one<br />\nintrasquad game and two practice<br />\ngames with Baltimore University<br />\nprior to yesterday's game.<br />\nBecause of bad weather, Bilgrav<br />\nhas not made his final cut. This<br />\nmainly affects the pitching staff<br />\nand the outfield. The infield is<br />\nset with John Newton at first<br />\nbase, Jerry Carr at second, Charley<br />\nWyble at third, and Loren Cox at<br />\nshortstop. Barrie Wood seems to be<br />\nthe number one catcher at the<br />\nmoment according to Bilgrav. In<br />\nthe outfield, Rowland King is set in<br />\nright field. Center field will probably be held down by Don Stoneseifer, but the left field spot is<br />\na question mark with Walt Radek,<br />\na pitcher, and Dick Mercer vying<br />\nfor that berth. The pitching staff<br />\nis very much up in the air because none of the pitchers have<br />\nbeen able to show much of their<br />\nstuff.<br />\nAs to the general outlook of<br />\nthe team, Bilgrav rates King and<br />\nNewton as his most cottsistent<br />\nhitters and feels that the power on<br />\nthe club will come from those two<br />\nplus Wood. The team doesn't have<br />\nmuch speed in Bilgrav's estimation<br />\nand so he won't have a \"running<br />\nteam\" nor will it bunt a lot.<br />\n\"We need a lot of work in the<br />\ninfield on double plays and slowhit balls. We are exceptionally<br />\nweak on team play, that is on such<br />\nthings as whether the first or second basemen should field - the ball<br />\nand backing each other up,\" said<br />\nBilgrav about his infield. Bilgrav<br />\ncontinued, \"Our outfielders should<br />\nbe good, for all of them seem to<br />\npossess. strong arms, especially<br />\nKing, Radek, and Stoneseifer.<br />\nMercer is a converted first baseman, but I think that he has a<br />\nstrong enough arm.\"<br />\n<br />\nBridgers spoke of as a \"big, powerful guy, who will show some rapid<br />\nimprovement once his form improves,\" the Jays took one, two,<br />\nthree, in the discus. Ray May, who<br />\nhas had no previous track experience, tied for second with a 5'4\"<br />\nhigh jump, and also tied for second in the pole vault.<br />\nThe Frosh runners showed<br />\nsome prowess in a few of the<br />\nevents. Though they all were running against varsity men, Jon<br />\nBerry won his heat in the low hurdles, Trenholm copped a third in<br />\nthe three-quarter mile and a fourth<br />\nin the 660, Robin Caples won two<br />\nvery close thirds in the 220 and<br />\n330 yard sprints,- and Pinky<br />\nHolmes took third in the onehalf<br />\nmile run. Bridgers hopes that<br />\nHolmes can stay with the early<br />\npace, because the freshman has a<br />\nstrong final kick which keeps him<br />\nin contention. The coach regards<br />\nhim not only as a fine varsity<br />\nprospect, but also, \"one of the<br />\nbest half-mile prospects Hopkins<br />\nhas ever had.\"<br />\n<br />\nV.09<br />\n<br />\nAlt<br />\nWith a tough ten-game schedule Washington and Lee College fur- large offensive team, have bette<br />\nfacing them, a good-looking Hop- ther intensified his opinion.

Al Hlavin, varsity<br />\nco-captain, whom the coach singled<br />\nout as \"our probable high-scorer<br />\nfor the season,\" ran three fine<br />\nraces. He won the low hurdles from<br />\na Towson boy who placed fourth<br />\nin the Mason-Dixon finals in 1954,<br />\ncopped a second in the high hurdles<br />\nand a third in the broad jump,<br />\ncompiling 10 points.<br />\nSam Wright, who took top honors in the 330, fourth in the shotput, and another fourth in the<br />\n220, and Jim Love, who won both<br />\nthe shot and discus, were other<br />\nJHU standouts.

The touring MIT nine<br />\nwas an unknown. quantity to Bob<br />\nBilgrav, the JHU mentor, and he<br />\nhad to send his team into the contest with a minimum of practice.<br />\nThe Jays had played only one<br />\nintrasquad game and two practice<br />\ngames with Baltimore University<br />\nprior to yesterday's game.<br />\nBecause of bad weather, Bilgrav<br />\nhas not made his final cut. This<br />\nmainly affects the pitching staff<br />\nand the outfield. The infield is<br />\nset with John Newton at first<br />\nbase, Jerry Carr at second, Charley<br />\nWyble at third, and Loren Cox at<br />\nshortstop. Barrie Wood seems to be<br />\nthe number one catcher at the<br />\nmoment according to Bilgrav. In<br />\nthe outfield, Rowland King is set in<br />\nright field. Center field will probably be held down by Don Stoneseifer, but the left field spot is<br />\na question mark with Walt Radek,<br />\na pitcher, and Dick Mercer vying<br />\nfor that berth. The pitching staff<br />\nis very much up in the air because none of the pitchers have<br />\nbeen able to show much of their<br />\nstuff.<br />\nAs to the general outlook of<br />\nthe team, Bilgrav rates King and<br />\nNewton as his most cottsistent<br />\nhitters and feels that the power on<br />\nthe club will come from those two<br />\nplus Wood. The team doesn't have<br />\nmuch speed in Bilgrav's estimation<br />\nand so he won't have a \"running<br />\nteam\" nor will it bunt a lot.<br />\n\"We need a lot of work in the<br />\ninfield on double plays and slowhit balls. We are exceptionally<br />\nweak on team play, that is on such<br />\nthings as whether the first or second basemen should field - the ball<br />\nand backing each other up,\" said<br />\nBilgrav about his infield. Bilgrav<br />\ncontinued, \"Our outfielders should<br />\nbe good, for all of them seem to<br />\npossess. strong arms, especially<br />\nKing, Radek, and Stoneseifer.<br />\nMercer is a converted first baseman, but I think that he has a<br />\nstrong enough arm.\"<br /><br />\nBridgers spoke of as a \"big, powerful guy, who will show some rapid<br />\nimprovement once his form improves,\" the Jays took one, two,<br />\nthree, in the discus. Ray May, who<br />\nhas had no previous track experience, tied for second with a 5'4\"<br />\nhigh jump, and also tied for second in the pole vault.<br />\nThe Frosh runners showed<br />\nsome prowess in a few of the<br />\nevents. Though they all were running against varsity men, Jon<br />\nBerry won his heat in the low hurdles, Trenholm copped a third in<br />\nthe three-quarter mile and a fourth<br />\nin the 660, Robin Caples won two<br />\nvery close thirds in the 220 and<br />\n330 yard sprints,- and Pinky<br />\nHolmes took third in the onehalf<br />\nmile run. Bridgers hopes that<br />\nHolmes can stay with the early<br />\npace, because the freshman has a<br />\nstrong final kick which keeps him<br />\nin contention. The coach regards<br />\nhim not only as a fine varsity<br />\nprospect, but also, \"one of the<br />\nbest half-mile prospects Hopkins<br />\nhas ever had.\"<br /><br />\nV.09<br /><br />\nAlt<br />\nWith a tough ten-game schedule Washington and Lee College fur- large offensive team, have bette<br />\nfacing them, a good-looking Hop- ther intensified his opinion.
