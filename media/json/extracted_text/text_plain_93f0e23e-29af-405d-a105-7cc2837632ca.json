Gagliano, Joe Gluhman, Bob Mitgang, Joseph Pedorella.<br />\n<br />\nSome Questions, Mr. Hull<br />\nMr. Emory Hull, now that we've read the article about<br />\nthe Cotillion Board, which appears on page one, we've still<br />\ngot a few questions.<br />\nYou say \"our main aim is to stimulate social interest.\" What<br />\nare you doing to \"stimulate social interest?\" We heard from<br />\nthe Cotillion Board only twice this year, once when you gave<br />\na dance, and once when you published a somewhat belated social<br />\nschedule. We emphatically did not hear from you when the<br />\nYMCA was forced to cancel a program because of a conflict,<br />\nor when the Engineers Control Board lost money because they<br />\nhad the same date as the Barnstormers.<br />\nYou also say, \"The success of our activities depends<br />\nalmost entirely on the cooperation of our students, which, I<br />\nam glad to say, has been excellent this year.\" Why excellent?<br />\nYour own dance, the Fall Cotillion, was \"poorly attended,\"<br />\naccording to your business manager. We also understood that the<br />\nother two major dances were not as successful as in previous<br />\nyears.<br />\nAs we understand it, the Board stands by to help with<br />\nany dance when' they are asked, but they are never asked.<br />\nWily aren't they asked? If the people giving dances don't know<br />\nabout the facilities of the Cotillion Board, or if they don't<br />\nknow how good the Cotillion Board is, perhaps the Board<br />\ncould gain by volunteering their services more actively. Helping<br />\nwith a dance must mean more than just selling tickets, or giving<br />\na hand with the decorations.<br />\nLet's look at the financial assistance you offer. It is<br />\ninteresting that you lend money for a dance and then take a<br />\neut of the profits. With your bank balance, unofficially quoted<br />\nto us as over a thousand dollars, you could afford just to lend<br />\nthe money, and let the profits alone. This bank balance, though,<br />\nbring us to our next question.<br />\nMr. Hull, what are you going to do with your money?<br />\nWe know that you once gave a $300 scholarship. That wa.s.'very<br />\ngood. We hope you do it again. But that still leaves a<br />\nthousand. There's a lot you can do with a thousand dollars.<br />\nFor instance\u2014You could buy tables for the gym. You could<br />\nunderwrite either the junior or frosh-soph prom so that one<br />\ndance each year could afford a reasonable, well-known orchestra.<br />\nThere are all varieties of bandS besides the big names we have<br />\nfor June Week and the tin horn specials we get for the gym<br />\ndances. You could use it to give small Friday night dances or<br />\nsocials, which might help to integrate and improve our badlybattered social life. You could, although its not directly connected with social activities, give it to the SAC for distribution<br />\nto needy activities.<br />\nIn short, Mr. Hull, haven't you and the controlling body<br />\nof the board made an effort to get by with as little work as<br />\npossible all around? With the new dormitory going up for<br />\n350 students, this is a time when student activities, including<br />\nsocial activities, should expand and plan ways to better undergraduate life and recreation. The Cotillion Board is currently<br />\na weak support in any expansion. It seems to us that the<br />\nBoard must begin to work imaginatively and intelligently on<br />\nsocial activities. If the controlling majority of the board does<br />\nnot feel up to that task, then they should make way for a more<br />\nindustrious group.<br />\n<br />\nJHU Magazine Received Prize<br />\nAs Best University Publication<br />\nBy MORT ALTERMAN<br />\nNow nearing its fourth birthday,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Magazine has<br />\nbecome one of the most respected<br />\nperiodicals in the country.

Gagliano, Joe Gluhman, Bob Mitgang, Joseph Pedorella.<br /><br />\nSome Questions, Mr. Hull<br />\nMr. Emory Hull, now that we've read the article about<br />\nthe Cotillion Board, which appears on page one, we've still<br />\ngot a few questions.<br />\nYou say \"our main aim is to stimulate social interest.\" What<br />\nare you doing to \"stimulate social interest?\" We heard from<br />\nthe Cotillion Board only twice this year, once when you gave<br />\na dance, and once when you published a somewhat belated social<br />\nschedule. We emphatically did not hear from you when the<br />\nYMCA was forced to cancel a program because of a conflict,<br />\nor when the Engineers Control Board lost money because they<br />\nhad the same date as the Barnstormers.<br />\nYou also say, \"The success of our activities depends<br />\nalmost entirely on the cooperation of our students, which, I<br />\nam glad to say, has been excellent this year.\" Why excellent?<br />\nYour own dance, the Fall Cotillion, was \"poorly attended,\"<br />\naccording to your business manager. We also understood that the<br />\nother two major dances were not as successful as in previous<br />\nyears.<br />\nAs we understand it, the Board stands by to help with<br />\nany dance when' they are asked, but they are never asked.<br />\nWily aren't they asked? If the people giving dances don't know<br />\nabout the facilities of the Cotillion Board, or if they don't<br />\nknow how good the Cotillion Board is, perhaps the Board<br />\ncould gain by volunteering their services more actively. Helping<br />\nwith a dance must mean more than just selling tickets, or giving<br />\na hand with the decorations.<br />\nLet's look at the financial assistance you offer. It is<br />\ninteresting that you lend money for a dance and then take a<br />\neut of the profits. With your bank balance, unofficially quoted<br />\nto us as over a thousand dollars, you could afford just to lend<br />\nthe money, and let the profits alone. This bank balance, though,<br />\nbring us to our next question.<br />\nMr. Hull, what are you going to do with your money?<br />\nWe know that you once gave a $300 scholarship. That wa.s.'very<br />\ngood. We hope you do it again. But that still leaves a<br />\nthousand. There's a lot you can do with a thousand dollars.<br />\nFor instance\u2014You could buy tables for the gym. You could<br />\nunderwrite either the junior or frosh-soph prom so that one<br />\ndance each year could afford a reasonable, well-known orchestra.<br />\nThere are all varieties of bandS besides the big names we have<br />\nfor June Week and the tin horn specials we get for the gym<br />\ndances. You could use it to give small Friday night dances or<br />\nsocials, which might help to integrate and improve our badlybattered social life. You could, although its not directly connected with social activities, give it to the SAC for distribution<br />\nto needy activities.<br />\nIn short, Mr. Hull, haven't you and the controlling body<br />\nof the board made an effort to get by with as little work as<br />\npossible all around? With the new dormitory going up for<br />\n350 students, this is a time when student activities, including<br />\nsocial activities, should expand and plan ways to better undergraduate life and recreation. The Cotillion Board is currently<br />\na weak support in any expansion. It seems to us that the<br />\nBoard must begin to work imaginatively and intelligently on<br />\nsocial activities. If the controlling majority of the board does<br />\nnot feel up to that task, then they should make way for a more<br />\nindustrious group.<br /><br />\nJHU Magazine Received Prize<br />\nAs Best University Publication<br />\nBy MORT ALTERMAN<br />\nNow nearing its fourth birthday,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Magazine has<br />\nbecome one of the most respected<br />\nperiodicals in the country.
