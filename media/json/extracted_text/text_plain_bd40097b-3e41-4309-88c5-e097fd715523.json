We made some<br />\nmoney last year, but it didn't<br />\ncome close to offsetting the<br />\nprevious year's losses.\"<br />\nThe bookstore manager also<br />\ntook issue with charges from<br />\nHimelfarb that prices at Follett's<br />\ndo not compare favorably with<br />\nthose charged with other<br />\nMaryland college bookstores.

He pointed out<br />\nthat Hopkins was fortunate in<br />\nbeing able to draw upon a large<br />\npool of alumni in law school and<br />\nin the legal profession, who are<br />\nwilling to speak before student<br />\ngroups (such as the PLS) and<br />\n<br />\nThe pot ofgold for filture attorneys.<br />\n<br />\nprovide students with some<br />\nexposure to the many facets of<br />\nthe legal profession.<br />\nThe PLS will also seek to<br />\nexpose students to \"the writings<br />\nof great jurists\"(a bibliography is<br />\nbeing planned), as well as provide<br />\nliterature with practical<br />\ninformation on the law school<br />\napplication process.<br />\nOwens claimed that pre-law<br />\nstudents are often ignorant of the<br />\n<br />\ndetails, complexities, and choices<br />\nwhich will confront them when<br />\nthey enter the legal field.<br />\nDrawing on his own experience.<br />\nOwens, a former Assistant<br />\nProsecutor with the Maryland<br />\nStates Attorney's office currently<br />\nworking in the Litigation<br />\nDivision of the Baltimore City<br />\nSolicitor's office, described the<br />\nwork of a trial lawyer as \"very<br />\nexciting, tense, but extremely<br />\n<br />\ndegree could. provide.<br />\nTerming a PLS \"the best<br />\nresource our students will have in<br />\nseeking law information\", Owens<br />\nstressed the overridtng<br />\nimportance of expanding<br />\ninformation availability. \"Law is<br />\na very complicated field,\" Owens<br />\nexplained, \"and reliable<br />\ninformation lets you see what<br />\nyou're getting into, and enables<br />\nyou to make an intelligent<br />\ndecision.\"<br />\nJealous mistress<br />\n\"Law is a jealous mistress,\"<br />\nOwens continued. \"It demands<br />\nall of your time\u2014maybe more so<br />\n'or the study than for the<br />\npiactice.\" \"A pre-law society<br />\nmay ease the trauma usually<br />\nexperienced by all first-year law<br />\nstudents, and help make it all less<br />\nconfusing\u2014but not less<br />\ndemanding.\" Owens said he<br />\nbelieves the PLS \"will be a<br />\nsuccess because it's a student run<br />\nventure, which will give it vitality<br />\nand drive.\"<br />\n<br />\ndemanding\". He went on to<br />\ncontend that many pre-law<br />\nstudents labor under the<br />\nmisconception that the purview<br />\nof the legal profession is limited<br />\nto criminal law. Owens admitted<br />\nthat, \"Many would not find that<br />\nsort of practice palatable.\"<br />\nOwens stated that pre-law<br />\nstudents needed to learn of the<br />\nmany career possibilities, in and<br />\nout of the legal field, that a law<br />\n<br />\nSpokesman Quinn said an<br />\norganizational meeting would be<br />\nheld on Tuesday, November 9, at<br />\n8 p.m. in Remsen 101. He<br />\nstressed that the size of the<br />\nturnout at that meeting would be<br />\nan important factor in the<br />\nattempt to obtain funds from the<br />\nSAC.<br />\n<br />\nand the court would recognize<br />\none of a series of wills written<br />\nbefore 1963, Stewart said. In<br />\nfact, a will written in 1954 by<br />\nPratt allocated Hopkins 30<br />\npercent of the total estate, he<br />\nadded. Obviously, Hopkins<br />\nofficials would not be too<br />\nchagrined to have their allotment<br />\nof the will increased, but funds<br />\nwill be withheld until a<br />\nsettlement is reached.<br />\nIn order for Winston to win<br />\nthe case she must prove that<br />\nPratt was influenced by the<br />\nbenefiting institutions to<br />\nbequeath money, along with<br />\nmental incompetency, the<br />\nTreasurer said.<br />\nLawyers for Winston have<br />\noffered to settle out of court for<br />\nSI million. They have tried to<br />\nconvince institutional<br />\nrepresentatives that this kind of<br />\nsolution would save them<br />\nburgeoning legal fees.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, Stewart said they<br />\n\"aren't interested\" in an out of<br />\ncourt decision.<br />\nTwo payments made<br />\nAlthough banks do not<br />\nnormally distribute funds until<br />\nan estate has been settled,<br />\nHopkins received S147 thousand<br />\nin two quarterly payments last<br />\nyear.

It is now in its<br />\nseventh year and includes Johns<br />\nHopkins, U.M.B.C., Towson<br />\n,State, and Goucher.<br />\n<br />\nThe Mayor's Fellowship places<br />\ninterns in city agencies. The<br />\nprogram's original design was to<br />\ncounteract apathy and lack of<br />\ntrust in government by allowing<br />\nthem to participate in it.<br />\nThe apparent reason for the<br />\napplication decrease this year lies<br />\nin three areas: both programils<br />\nhave undergone a change in<br />\ngraduation credits offered,<br />\ngeneral apathy on campus, and a<br />\nlack of publicity, said Bob<br />\nRoach, C.P.L. student advisor.<br />\nPreviously earning nine credits,<br />\nthe Mayor's Fellowship is now<br />\n<br />\nworth six. The C.P.L. has<br />\nundergone a similar change from<br />\nsix to five.<br />\nDuring the year the<br />\nparticipants of both programs<br />\nmeet once a week alternating<br />\nbetween individual and seminar<br />\nsessions.

Numerous attempts have been made to<br />\nhave the state increase its funding formula for colleges and<br />\nuniversities, but they have repeatedly met with failure.<br />\nApparently the state has no intention of increasing funding<br />\nfor Hopkins or any other higher educational institution in<br />\nMaryland in the near future. Close observers are probably<br />\ncorrect in their. assessment that the citizens of tbis state at<br />\npresent hold a hostile view towards substitive funding of<br />\ncolleges and universities, questioning their basic effectiveness.<br />\nHowever, Maryland's newly formed board of higher<br />\neducation has recently presented a detailed study which<br />\nconfirms the level of state funding to colleges and universities<br />\nto be well below what it should. Although not included in<br />\ntheir report, it is a fact that presently Maryland is 39th of all<br />\nstates in terms of the appropriations to higher education.<br />\nThis is the same state which boasts of its economic vitality<br />\nand ranks 20th in the nation in terms of the revenue<br />\ncollected as a percentage of personal income.<br />\nIn the past, Hopkins officials and those from other<br />\ninstitutions have wisely elected to refrain from publicly<br />\nlambasting the decided impropriety of this situation. It<br />\nappears that the time has long since arrived when some<br />\nquestions must be raised regarding Maryland's continued<br />\nneglect of higher education.<br />\n<br />\nFirst-rate chamber music:<br />\nShriver Hall Concert Series<br />\nAnd more sounds for you<br />\nBy J.D. CONSI DINE<br />\nTo the average concert goer, it would<br />\nseem that the bulk of western music was<br />\nwritten for full orchestra and opera<br />\ncompanies. Not that that is actually case,<br />\nbut the American public seems totally<br />\noriented to the idea of the large orchestra<br />\nand the Opera House.<br />\nA quick trip to a well-stocked record<br />\nstore would quickly clear up such<br />\nmisconceptions. Recordings of chamber<br />\nmusic are both popular and numerous. In<br />\naddition to the countless recordings of<br />\npiano sonatas, string trios, quartets, piano<br />\nquintets, the small orchestra is coming<br />\ninto prominence again, if only as a<br />\nrecording group.<br />\nIf there are almost as many complete<br />\nsets of the Beethoven quartets as there<br />\nare of the symphonies, if the Academy of<br />\nSt. Martin's in the Fields has more<br />\nrecordings out than the Los Angeles<br />\nPhilharmonic, then why can't we see<br />\nchamber music and hear chamber<br />\norchestras in Baltimore?<br />\nBut we can, we can.<br />\nOne needn't travel far to hear first -ate<br />\nchamber music. The Shriver Hall Concert<br />\nSeries schedules six concerts of chamber<br />\nmusic yearly, with brilliant performances<br />\nby well known artists. Among those who<br />\nwill appear in this season are Contralto<br />\nMaureen Forrester, Cellist Pierre<br />\nFournier, the Greenhouse<br />\nTramples-Treger Trio, and the Verneer<br />\nand Italian Quartets.<br />\nSonic of the artists, like the Quartetto<br />\nItalian\u00b0, are veterans of previous seasons.<br />\nOthers, like the Greenhouse Trampler<br />\nTreger Trio were assembled specifically<br />\nfor the series. All exhibit a high degree of<br />\nexcellence, which reflects the exacting<br />\nstandards of the series.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nLast Friday an Evolutionary<br />\n?biology test was given in Remsen<br />\ncVm, t.wo knimite6.<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\ntest your knowledge or mastery<br />\nof the chemistry (despite the<br />\nviolent protests and foot<br />\nm-axwv:vny. kkvak<br />\nk\u2018Ae,<br />\non\\<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nIle was leaving the test<br />\ntin proctored. Foolishly, at the<br />\ntime I thought nothing of it.<br />\nLater, I discovered that some<br />\npeople had been cheating.<br />\nI would like to think that<br />\nstudying for that test profited<br />\nme. Unfortunately, since grades<br />\nare curved my effort has been<br />\ncheapened; my grade will be<br />\nlower than I deserve. Beyond<br />\nthat I feel insulted that other<br />\nstudents would respect my work<br />\nSO little as to cheat.<br />\nIf the professor truly<br />\ndepended on the individuals'<br />\nintegrity I think that he was too<br />\nnaive. If not then he simply<br />\ndidn't care whether or. not<br />\ncheating occurred. In any case, I<br />\nbelieve that this test should be<br />\nin<br />\nand that a<br />\nPROCTORED one be given in its<br />\nstead. Surely a proctor is little<br />\nenough protection for honest<br />\nwork.<br />\nK. Barrett<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n\"Screwed up\" is not a strong<br />\nenough term. To describe Intro<br />\nOrganic Lab as \"screwed up- is a<br />\ngross oversimplification. The<br />\nentire course is brilliantly<br />\ndesigned to 'psych' out an entire<br />\ngroup of aspiring physicians. It is<br />\nquite obviously the \"weed out\"<br />\ncourse of a university which is<br />\n\"pre-med\" saturated (as much as<br />\nt he Administration would<br />\ndownplay that aspect of the<br />\nin self ut ion). I was relatively<br />\nlucky in getting out of the course<br />\nwith my GPA and confidence<br />\nintact. Still. I see groups of<br />\nexasperated and tired students<br />\nleaving Remsen at 8:30, most of<br />\nwhom would sign away their<br />\nsouls for a few more crystals of<br />\nso met hingorotheride. The<br />\nquestion which plagues me is<br />\n\"Why\"? What possible reason is<br />\nthere to put these people through<br />\nt he psychological hell of an<br />\nOrganic Lab? The lab does not<br />\n<br />\nh C.1<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\n<br />\n/WO;<br />\n<br />\ni-e<br />\n.<br />\n/4,71(MS<br />\n<br />\npeople<br />\n<br />\nGYM<br />\n<br />\nthe recrwc1 salcs of the Academ<br />\n<br />\ninvolved in<br />\n<br />\ninstructing the course are<br />\ninsensitive to the needs of<br />\nindividuals. The apathetic looks<br />\nand comments I received from<br />\nthe instructors were stunning.<br />\nOnce again I must suppose this is<br />\npsychological-a means of<br />\nkeeping up the tension in the lab.<br />\nI must admit it is an effective<br />\nweapon.<br />\nWouldn't we all benefit from a<br />\ncourse structured more so that<br />\nthe student's knowledge (and not<br />\nhis nerve) is tested? The problem<br />\nis that once we escape from \"that<br />\nplace\" we forget what a crushing<br />\nexperience it really was. We don't<br />\nhave the guts to stand up and say<br />\n\"this is wrong, it must be<br />\nchanged.- Maybe we've come to<br />\nthe crux of the problem. How do<br />\nstudents change the way they're<br />\ntaught? This is one way.<br />\nAlthough I will use a pseudonym<br />\nin this letter, for fear of<br />\nrepercussions to which I am still<br />\nliable (I have learned not to make<br />\nenemies at this school). It is clear<br />\nthat something must be done.<br />\nA course designed more like<br />\nt he Intermediate Organic Lab<br />\nwould be a definite<br />\nimprovement. Even better would<br />\nbe a uniting of the Organic Lab<br />\nwith the Organic class, perhaps as<br />\na one credit or pass/fail addition<br />\nto the course, giving one grade<br />\nfor Organic as a whole. Hopefully<br />\nsomeone in the Chemistry<br />\ndepartment will at least look into<br />\nthese and other possibilities, and<br />\nnot let the matter pass over him<br />\nwithout giving it a second<br />\nthought. It is shameful to me to<br />\nthink that a school like Johns<br />\nHopkins would need to resort to<br />\nthese \"weeding-out- tactics; it's<br />\njust so damn juvenile.<br />\nCent ainly this letter is<br />\nidealistic. Knowing the<br />\nChemistry department. this will<br />\nbe passed over like every other<br />\nsuggestion and end up where all<br />\nthe others eventually end<br />\nup-crumpled in the trash.<br />\nBenjamin Zoic<br />\n<br />\nPierre \"Fingers\" Fournier<br />\n<br />\nSchechtman is an accomplished<br />\nconductor, who has guested with such<br />\norchestras as the Baltimore Symphony,<br />\nthe Philadelphia Orchestra, as well as<br />\norchestras in Denmark and Norway.

The<br />\nmusic of the series ranges from Bach to<br />\nBritten. And the acoustics of Center<br />\nStage should make the series an aesthetic<br />\ndelight.<br />\nBut how to get the public interested?<br />\nWell, you push a lot. Oddly enough, one<br />\nof those pushing hardest for the<br />\nOrchestra is a recent Hopkins<br />\ngraduate,<br />\n_<br />\n_<br />\nRobert Williams (and you thought we all<br />\nbecame doctors!).

Unlike most<br />\nconcert series, which have student<br />\ndiscounts as a means to fill the house<br />\nafter the regular customers, the \u2022Shriver<br />\nHall series sees the student concert goer<br />\nas the major concern.<br />\nThis year, the Series is attempting<br />\nsomething new, with a January concert<br />\nby violinist Mitchell Stern. Stern, who is<br />\nwithout doubt to become one of the<br />\nbrightest stars of the future, is at present<br />\na student at the Curtis Institute in<br />\nPhiladelphia. He made his debut at age<br />\nfifteen with the Cleveland Orchestra (no<br />\nmean feat, indeed), and the concert will<br />\nbe held<br />\nas a sort of sponsoring by the<br />\nseries. It is the hope of the Series that this<br />\nwill become a staple event of each season,<br />\nthat they may give a promising young<br />\ntalent the exposure he would be unable<br />\nto afford on his own, while still keeping<br />\nthe strict artistic standards it holds for<br />\nthe established artist.<br />\nThe concert will be held on January 8,<br />\n1977, and tickets are free to subscribers,<br />\nand available at a nominal fee to the<br />\ngeneral public. For information on the<br />\nseries, contact Jeanne Feinberg by either<br />\nvisiting Shriver Hall, or calling 338-7164<br />\nor 338-7165.<br />\nAlthough the Shriver Hall Series is<br />\neasily the best as far as the established<br />\nchamber series go, this year marks the<br />\nbeginning of what is sure to become a<br />\nmajor force on the Baltimore musical<br />\nscene. Orchestra Piccolo under the<br />\ndirection of Saul Schechtman.<br />\nMost listeners don't realize it, but the<br />\npresent day orchestra dates only as far<br />\nback as Beethoven and Berlioz. In the<br />\ndays of Mozart, it was common to have<br />\nno more than eight to twelve strings, and<br />\nan almost equal amount of winds. Before<br />\nthat, the average orchestra, a group<br />\nalmost exclusively designed for court and<br />\nchurch playing. consisted of four to six<br />\nviolins , two or three violas. a couple celli<br />\nor gambas, and an occasional doublebass,<br />\nwith a keyboard and optional wind<br />\nplayers. It was for ensembles such as this<br />\nthat such masterworks as Bach's<br />\nBrandenburg Concertos, H a enders<br />\nConcerti Grossi, and Mozart's Serenade in<br />\nG, K. 525 (\"Eine Kleine Nacbtmusik\")<br />\nwere all written for ensembles of this size.<br />\n<br />\n1,5<,vc.11-lor<br />\n<br />\nlit<br />\n<br />\nin inc pietas. or Karl 11,7111-1Cilinger's<br />\nStuttgart Chamber Orchestra will<br />\n<br />\nMaureen Forrester<br />\n<br />\nFor those unacquainted with the<br />\nartists. the following is an attempt to<br />\nsketch their strengths and backgrounds.<br />\nContralto Maurren Forrester is one of<br />\nthe most respected concert voices in the<br />\nworld today. Her voice is warm and<br />\nexpressive, and strongly schooled in the<br />\nGerman style. Her recordings range from<br />\nBach to Verdi. but her real strength is<br />\nMahler. She has recorded with such<br />\nmaster conducters as Bruno Walter and<br />\nBernard Haitink, and has a reputation<br />\nwhich, in this era of Mahler-mania, is<br />\nmore than considerable.<br />\nThose interested in the music of String<br />\nQuartets need not be told of the<br />\nQuartetto Italiano's legendary standing.<br />\nTheir meat is the heart of the String<br />\nQuartet's repetoire: the quartets of<br />\nMozart, Beethoven, Brahms, and Haydn.<br />\nThe playing is rich and sonorous, and<br />\ntheir interpretations are often definitive.<br />\nWith a contract with Philips Records,<br />\nthey have recorded most or all of the<br />\nMozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann,<br />\nand Webern Quartets, as well as the Ravel<br />\nand Debussy.<br />\nWhen presented with such an ensemble<br />\nas the Greenhouse Trampler Treger Tri,<br />\none is tempted to think of an all-star<br />\nteam. Surely, it would be difficult to put<br />\ntogether a string trio more perfectly<br />\nmatched than this.<br />\nCellist Bernard Greenhouse, of the<br />\nBeaux Arts Trio (who were at Shriven<br />\nHall last year to perform the complete<br />\nBeethoven Trio cycle) will be joining<br />\nviolist Walter Trampler and violinist<br />\nCharles Treger for what should be a most<br />\nremarkable concert.<br />\nThe Sunday after next, virtuoso cellist<br />\nPierre Fournier will give a recital of cello<br />\nsonatas. One of the world's truly great<br />\ncellists, he is easily among the ranks of<br />\nsuch players as Mstislav Rostropovitch<br />\nand Paul Tortellier. He is no stranger to<br />\nany facet of the literature, and performs<br />\nconcerto and sonata with similar ease. He<br />\nhas recorded the Brahms Double<br />\nConcerto with Oistrakh, as well as the<br />\nDvorak concerto with Szelli. His Bach<br />\nSolo Suites are considered by many to be<br />\nthe definitive performances, and he holds<br />\na prestigious recording contract with the<br />\nDeutches Grammophon label.<br />\nPerhaps the best part of the series is<br />\nthe price. Student tickets can be obtained<br />\n<br />\nindicate. But the problem live<br />\nperformances lace is the size of a concert<br />\nhall.<br />\nIf you have ever had the misfortune of<br />\nstruggling to hear a major orchestra in a<br />\nhall the \u2022size of the Civic Center, you may<br />\nhave an idea of what a Chamber<br />\nOrchestra sounds like in a normal concert<br />\nhall. The music, as well as the groups,<br />\nwere never intended to play to crowds<br />\nthat large, and so the large hall mentality<br />\nof Americans has been a gross handicap.<br />\nBut when Paul Schechtman happened<br />\nto pass by the newly rennovated Center<br />\nStage, he had a brainstorm. What would<br />\nbe more perfect for a small orchestra than<br />\na small hall, like Center Stage?<br />\nHe knew the idea would not be hard to<br />\nsell to the musical establishment in<br />\nBaltimore, as the Baltimore Symphony's<br />\nSergiu Commisiona had toyed with the<br />\nidea of a Chamber Orchestra himself. It<br />\nwas also easy to find a group of<br />\nbusinessmen eager to build up the City's<br />\ncultural level.

Over 90<br />\npercent of the play took place<br />\nwell within the Washington end<br />\nof the field as the Jays outshot<br />\ntheir opponents 38-13. In fact, in<br />\nthe 20 minute overtime period,<br />\nthe Washington hooters fired<br />\nonly one shot\u2014a shot that cost<br />\nthe Blue Jays a share of the<br />\nleague championship.<br />\nThe key to the Washington<br />\nvictory had to be the superb<br />\nperformance of their goalie who<br />\nseemed to stop each shot that<br />\nwas fired by the Jay attackmen.<br />\n\"Their goalie was definitely<br />\nriding a lucky streak today,\"<br />\ncommented senior co-captain<br />\nTom Myrick. \"Most of the shots<br />\nhe stopped he probably could<br />\nnot have seen until the last<br />\nsecond.

The<br />\nplay actually developed in the<br />\nWashington end of the field with<br />\nthe Jay offense applying fierce<br />\npressure. A defensive back, in<br />\ncomplete desperationi, sent a<br />\nclearing pass that was scooped up<br />\nby an alert opposing winger.<br />\nI<br />\nUnfortunately for the Jays<br />\nonly one defender was in<br />\nposition, sweeper back Frank<br />\nOlszewski, and he was unable to<br />\nreceiving more opportunities in<br />\nstop the threat.

As the two<br />\nbodies crashed together the ball<br />\nwas pushed into the net. And<br />\napproximately 40 seconds later<br />\nthe horn sounded ending the Jay<br />\nseason in disappointment.<br />\n<br />\nThe team ends this year's<br />\nplay with a 5-5-1 record.

Quarterback Tom<br />\nBender then hit Dave Emala with<br />\nthe two-point conversion pass<br />\nand Hopkins had a quick 8-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nOn the ensuing series of plays,<br />\nSwarthmore fumbled and the<br />\nalert Jay defense recovered at the<br />\nGarnet 18-yard line. However,<br />\nthe JHU offensive unit was<br />\nunable to move the ball and the<br />\nhost team regained possession<br />\nwhen a fourth down play did not<br />\npick up the required yardage.<br />\nThis defensive stand seemed to<br />\ninspire the Swarthmore offense.<br />\nStarting at their own ten-yard<br />\nline, the Pennsylvanians moved<br />\ndownfield on the ground to a<br />\nfirst down at the Blue Jay<br />\nforty-six. One play later, a<br />\nGarnet running back broke clear<br />\ninto the secondary and outraced<br />\nthe Hopkins defense to the end<br />\nzone. The two-point conversion<br />\nattempt was good and the score<br />\nstood at 8-8.<br />\nThe remainder of the first half<br />\nwas a battle of the punters. The<br />\nteams accumulated only five first<br />\ndowns in the entire quarter while<br />\nneither offense was able to move<br />\nto within thirty yards of the<br />\nopposing goal line.<br />\nThe opening of the second half<br />\nbrought a rebirth of the offensive<br />\npart of the game. Swarthmore<br />\ntook the opening kick-off and<br />\nseemed determined to break the<br />\n<br />\ntic. Beginning at their forty-one,<br />\nthe Garnets put together a<br />\nsustained drive and moved to a<br />\nfirst down at the Blue Jay one<br />\nyard line.<br />\nHowever, a fumbled snap on<br />\nthe next play was recovered by<br />\nHopkins and the Homewood<br />\noffense went to work from the<br />\ntwo yard line. A pair of running<br />\nplays produced negligible gains<br />\nand so \u2022 a quick kick was<br />\nattempted on.third down.<br />\nUnfortunately for the Jays,<br />\ntheir hosts realized what was<br />\ncoming and rushed through to<br />\nblock the kick. The ball was<br />\nfallen upon by a Swarthmore<br />\ndefender in the end zone for a<br />\ntouchdown. A successful two<br />\npoint conversion followed and<br />\nsuddenly JHU found itself on the<br />\nshort end of a 16-8 score.<br />\nHopkins moved quickly to tie<br />\nthe score. Taking the following<br />\nkick-off at their thirty-five yard<br />\nline, the Blue Jays rediscovered<br />\nthe forward pass (they hadn't<br />\ncompleted a pass in the first half)<br />\nand marched downfield on the<br />\nstrength of Tom Bender's right<br />\narm.<br />\nOn a fourth and four situation<br />\nfrom the Swarthmore twelve<br />\nyard line, Bender hit tight end<br />\nMike Rhodey with a pass and<br />\nRhodey rambled untouched into<br />\nthe end zone. The final points of<br />\nthe afternoon were scored<br />\nmoments later as Bob Geist took<br />\na Bender aerial and, on an<br />\nexcellent second effort, went<br />\nacross the goal line for the<br />\ntwo-point conversion, biiiiging<br />\nthe count to 16-16.<br />\nFrom that point on. the Jays<br />\n<br />\nwere in complete control of the<br />\ncontest although they could<br />\nnever find the Points that would<br />\nhave given them the victory. The<br />\ndefense allowed only one Garnet<br />\nfirst down after the score was<br />\ntied and gave the Jay offense the<br />\nball four times through recovered<br />\nturnovers.<br />\nMeanwhile, the JHU offense<br />\nwas able to move the ball, but<br />\nnever quite far e nough.<br />\nlast<br />\nEpitomizing this was the<br />\nBlue Jay offensive effort of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThis final opportunity clinic<br />\nminutes<br />\nwith less than two<br />\nremaining in the game, as JaY<br />\nCoulter<br />\ndefensive back Brian<br />\npicked off a pass and returned it<br />\nto the Swarthmore forty-three.

He explained his position:<br />\n\"One very obvious way to do this<br />\nwould be to take the bookstore<br />\nunder the auspices of the<br />\nUniversity as they do at the<br />\nmedical school.\"<br />\n\"Follett's came in at a time<br />\nwhen the Bookstore was losing<br />\nmoney. The University was losing<br />\nmoney too then.

Without citing<br />\nfigure on the matter, Himelfarb<br />\nconjectured that if the<br />\nHomewood campus bookstore<br />\nand the Medical school work<br />\ntogether they can \"acquire<br />\ndiscount rates and add to their<br />\nsavings by decreasing costs.\"<br /><br />\nHimelfarb expressed<br />\nis suspicion that Follett's is<br />\ncurrently making a profit at the<br />\nHomewood location, a check<br />\nwith Follett's Homewood<br />\nManager Jim Ehle showed that in<br />\nfact the bookstore has been<br />\nrunning in the red for the past<br />\ntwo years. \"I don't know what<br />\nSheldon (Himelfarb) is talking<br />\nabout,\" declared Ehle. \"We have<br />\nnot made a profit in the last<br />\ncouple of years. We made some<br />\nmoney last year, but it didn't<br />\ncome close to offsetting the<br />\nprevious year's losses.\"<br />\nThe bookstore manager also<br />\ntook issue with charges from<br />\nHimelfarb that prices at Follett's<br />\ndo not compare favorably with<br />\nthose charged with other<br />\nMaryland college bookstores. He<br />\ncontended, \"We have looked at<br />\nother stores. We are in contact<br />\nwith other stores, While some<br />\nthings are cheaper, some are<br />\nmore expensive. But in general<br />\nour prices are competitive.\" A<br />\nsurvey published in February<br />\n1975 by the News-Letter found<br />\nthat textbook prices at the<br />\nFollett's book Center were<br />\ncomparable to those charged at<br />\nother college bookstores,<br />\nalthough its prices for non-text<br />\nitems, including supplies,.were<br />\nsignificantly higher than the<br />\nmean.<br />\nHimelfarb said that he hopes<br />\nto conduct another comparative<br />\nstudy of bookstore prices in the<br />\narea, with the assistance of those<br />\nwho show at tomorrow's<br />\nmeeting, and present these<br />\nfigures to Dean of Students Jakie<br />\nHall.

The<br />\neffort is being coordinated by a<br />\ncommittee of six Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nCommittee spokesman William<br />\nQuinn said he and his associates<br />\nwere concerned about the lack of<br />\nan adequate channel for law<br />\nschool information at Hopkins<br />\nQuinn asse<br />\n- rted that \"There are about<br />\n200 declared pre-law majors a<br />\nHopkins, and Pi Sigma Alph:<br />\n(the political science hono<br />\nsociety) doesn't fulfill the need<br />\nof pre-law students.\"<br />\nPre -law adviser Ronald C<br />\nOwens, an active supporter of th(<br />\nPre-Law Society (PLS) project<br />\nsaid that the primary aim of ;<br />\nPLS would be to provid(<br />\ninformation, in the form o<br />\nSpeakers, reading materials, and<br />\ninterviews, on law schools and on<br />\nthe legal profession. \"It's a<br />\nmatter of being able to provide<br />\nstudents with very very<br />\nimportant career choices,\"<br />\nOwens noted. He pointed out<br />\nthat Hopkins was fortunate in<br />\nbeing able to draw upon a large<br />\npool of alumni in law school and<br />\nin the legal profession, who are<br />\nwilling to speak before student<br />\ngroups (such as the PLS) and<br /><br />\nThe pot ofgold for filture attorneys.<br /><br />\nprovide students with some<br />\nexposure to the many facets of<br />\nthe legal profession.<br />\nThe PLS will also seek to<br />\nexpose students to \"the writings<br />\nof great jurists\"(a bibliography is<br />\nbeing planned), as well as provide<br />\nliterature with practical<br />\ninformation on the law school<br />\napplication process.<br />\nOwens claimed that pre-law<br />\nstudents are often ignorant of the<br /><br />\ndetails, complexities, and choices<br />\nwhich will confront them when<br />\nthey enter the legal field.<br />\nDrawing on his own experience.<br />\nOwens, a former Assistant<br />\nProsecutor with the Maryland<br />\nStates Attorney's office currently<br />\nworking in the Litigation<br />\nDivision of the Baltimore City<br />\nSolicitor's office, described the<br />\nwork of a trial lawyer as \"very<br />\nexciting, tense, but extremely<br /><br />\ndegree could. provide.<br />\nTerming a PLS \"the best<br />\nresource our students will have in<br />\nseeking law information\", Owens<br />\nstressed the overridtng<br />\nimportance of expanding<br />\ninformation availability. \"Law is<br />\na very complicated field,\" Owens<br />\nexplained, \"and reliable<br />\ninformation lets you see what<br />\nyou're getting into, and enables<br />\nyou to make an intelligent<br />\ndecision.\"<br />\nJealous mistress<br />\n\"Law is a jealous mistress,\"<br />\nOwens continued. \"It demands<br />\nall of your time\u2014maybe more so<br />\n'or the study than for the<br />\npiactice.\" \"A pre-law society<br />\nmay ease the trauma usually<br />\nexperienced by all first-year law<br />\nstudents, and help make it all less<br />\nconfusing\u2014but not less<br />\ndemanding.\" Owens said he<br />\nbelieves the PLS \"will be a<br />\nsuccess because it's a student run<br />\nventure, which will give it vitality<br />\nand drive.\"<br /><br />\ndemanding\". He went on to<br />\ncontend that many pre-law<br />\nstudents labor under the<br />\nmisconception that the purview<br />\nof the legal profession is limited<br />\nto criminal law. Owens admitted<br />\nthat, \"Many would not find that<br />\nsort of practice palatable.\"<br />\nOwens stated that pre-law<br />\nstudents needed to learn of the<br />\nmany career possibilities, in and<br />\nout of the legal field, that a law<br /><br />\nSpokesman Quinn said an<br />\norganizational meeting would be<br />\nheld on Tuesday, November 9, at<br />\n8 p.m. in Remsen 101. He<br />\nstressed that the size of the<br />\nturnout at that meeting would be<br />\nan important factor in the<br />\nattempt to obtain funds from the<br />\nSAC.<br /><br />\nand the court would recognize<br />\none of a series of wills written<br />\nbefore 1963, Stewart said. In<br />\nfact, a will written in 1954 by<br />\nPratt allocated Hopkins 30<br />\npercent of the total estate, he<br />\nadded. Obviously, Hopkins<br />\nofficials would not be too<br />\nchagrined to have their allotment<br />\nof the will increased, but funds<br />\nwill be withheld until a<br />\nsettlement is reached.<br />\nIn order for Winston to win<br />\nthe case she must prove that<br />\nPratt was influenced by the<br />\nbenefiting institutions to<br />\nbequeath money, along with<br />\nmental incompetency, the<br />\nTreasurer said.<br />\nLawyers for Winston have<br />\noffered to settle out of court for<br />\nSI million. They have tried to<br />\nconvince institutional<br />\nrepresentatives that this kind of<br />\nsolution would save them<br />\nburgeoning legal fees.<br /><br />\nHowever, Stewart said they<br />\n\"aren't interested\" in an out of<br />\ncourt decision.<br />\nTwo payments made<br />\nAlthough banks do not<br />\nnormally distribute funds until<br />\nan estate has been settled,<br />\nHopkins received S147 thousand<br />\nin two quarterly payments last<br />\nyear.

The<br />\nprogram's original design was to<br />\ncounteract apathy and lack of<br />\ntrust in government by allowing<br />\nthem to participate in it.<br />\nThe apparent reason for the<br />\napplication decrease this year lies<br />\nin three areas: both programils<br />\nhave undergone a change in<br />\ngraduation credits offered,<br />\ngeneral apathy on campus, and a<br />\nlack of publicity, said Bob<br />\nRoach, C.P.L. student advisor.<br />\nPreviously earning nine credits,<br />\nthe Mayor's Fellowship is now<br /><br />\nworth six.

Numerous attempts have been made to<br />\nhave the state increase its funding formula for colleges and<br />\nuniversities, but they have repeatedly met with failure.<br />\nApparently the state has no intention of increasing funding<br />\nfor Hopkins or any other higher educational institution in<br />\nMaryland in the near future. Close observers are probably<br />\ncorrect in their. assessment that the citizens of tbis state at<br />\npresent hold a hostile view towards substitive funding of<br />\ncolleges and universities, questioning their basic effectiveness.<br />\nHowever, Maryland's newly formed board of higher<br />\neducation has recently presented a detailed study which<br />\nconfirms the level of state funding to colleges and universities<br />\nto be well below what it should. Although not included in<br />\ntheir report, it is a fact that presently Maryland is 39th of all<br />\nstates in terms of the appropriations to higher education.<br />\nThis is the same state which boasts of its economic vitality<br />\nand ranks 20th in the nation in terms of the revenue<br />\ncollected as a percentage of personal income.<br />\nIn the past, Hopkins officials and those from other<br />\ninstitutions have wisely elected to refrain from publicly<br />\nlambasting the decided impropriety of this situation. It<br />\nappears that the time has long since arrived when some<br />\nquestions must be raised regarding Maryland's continued<br />\nneglect of higher education.<br /><br />\nFirst-rate chamber music:<br />\nShriver Hall Concert Series<br />\nAnd more sounds for you<br />\nBy J.D. CONSI DINE<br />\nTo the average concert goer, it would<br />\nseem that the bulk of western music was<br />\nwritten for full orchestra and opera<br />\ncompanies. Not that that is actually case,<br />\nbut the American public seems totally<br />\noriented to the idea of the large orchestra<br />\nand the Opera House.<br />\nA quick trip to a well-stocked record<br />\nstore would quickly clear up such<br />\nmisconceptions. Recordings of chamber<br />\nmusic are both popular and numerous. In<br />\naddition to the countless recordings of<br />\npiano sonatas, string trios, quartets, piano<br />\nquintets, the small orchestra is coming<br />\ninto prominence again, if only as a<br />\nrecording group.<br />\nIf there are almost as many complete<br />\nsets of the Beethoven quartets as there<br />\nare of the symphonies, if the Academy of<br />\nSt. Martin's in the Fields has more<br />\nrecordings out than the Los Angeles<br />\nPhilharmonic, then why can't we see<br />\nchamber music and hear chamber<br />\norchestras in Baltimore?<br />\nBut we can, we can.<br />\nOne needn't travel far to hear first -ate<br />\nchamber music. The Shriver Hall Concert<br />\nSeries schedules six concerts of chamber<br />\nmusic yearly, with brilliant performances<br />\nby well known artists. Among those who<br />\nwill appear in this season are Contralto<br />\nMaureen Forrester, Cellist Pierre<br />\nFournier, the Greenhouse<br />\nTramples-Treger Trio, and the Verneer<br />\nand Italian Quartets.<br />\nSonic of the artists, like the Quartetto<br />\nItalian\u00b0, are veterans of previous seasons.<br />\nOthers, like the Greenhouse Trampler<br />\nTreger Trio were assembled specifically<br />\nfor the series. All exhibit a high degree of<br />\nexcellence, which reflects the exacting<br />\nstandards of the series.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nLast Friday an Evolutionary<br />\n?biology test was given in Remsen<br />\ncVm, t.wo knimite6.<br />\nN<br /><br />\ntest your knowledge or mastery<br />\nof the chemistry (despite the<br />\nviolent protests and foot<br />\nm-axwv:vny. kkvak<br />\nk\u2018Ae,<br />\non\\<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nIle was leaving the test<br />\ntin proctored.

The apathetic looks<br />\nand comments I received from<br />\nthe instructors were stunning.<br />\nOnce again I must suppose this is<br />\npsychological-a means of<br />\nkeeping up the tension in the lab.<br />\nI must admit it is an effective<br />\nweapon.<br />\nWouldn't we all benefit from a<br />\ncourse structured more so that<br />\nthe student's knowledge (and not<br />\nhis nerve) is tested? The problem<br />\nis that once we escape from \"that<br />\nplace\" we forget what a crushing<br />\nexperience it really was. We don't<br />\nhave the guts to stand up and say<br />\n\"this is wrong, it must be<br />\nchanged.- Maybe we've come to<br />\nthe crux of the problem. How do<br />\nstudents change the way they're<br />\ntaught? This is one way.<br />\nAlthough I will use a pseudonym<br />\nin this letter, for fear of<br />\nrepercussions to which I am still<br />\nliable (I have learned not to make<br />\nenemies at this school). It is clear<br />\nthat something must be done.<br />\nA course designed more like<br />\nt he Intermediate Organic Lab<br />\nwould be a definite<br />\nimprovement. Even better would<br />\nbe a uniting of the Organic Lab<br />\nwith the Organic class, perhaps as<br />\na one credit or pass/fail addition<br />\nto the course, giving one grade<br />\nfor Organic as a whole. Hopefully<br />\nsomeone in the Chemistry<br />\ndepartment will at least look into<br />\nthese and other possibilities, and<br />\nnot let the matter pass over him<br />\nwithout giving it a second<br />\nthought. It is shameful to me to<br />\nthink that a school like Johns<br />\nHopkins would need to resort to<br />\nthese \"weeding-out- tactics; it's<br />\njust so damn juvenile.<br />\nCent ainly this letter is<br />\nidealistic. Knowing the<br />\nChemistry department. this will<br />\nbe passed over like every other<br />\nsuggestion and end up where all<br />\nthe others eventually end<br />\nup-crumpled in the trash.<br />\nBenjamin Zoic<br /><br />\nPierre \"Fingers\" Fournier<br /><br />\nSchechtman is an accomplished<br />\nconductor, who has guested with such<br />\norchestras as the Baltimore Symphony,<br />\nthe Philadelphia Orchestra, as well as<br />\norchestras in Denmark and Norway. He<br />\nwound up in Baltimore because his Wife,<br />\nDr. Carolyn Raney, is associated with the<br />\nPeabody Insitute.<br />\nThe musicians of Orchestra Piccolo are<br />\na hand-picked mix of the cream of the<br />\nSymphony and the Peabody faculty. The<br />\nmusic of the series ranges from Bach to<br />\nBritten. And the acoustics of Center<br />\nStage should make the series an aesthetic<br />\ndelight.<br />\nBut how to get the public interested?<br />\nWell, you push a lot. Oddly enough, one<br />\nof those pushing hardest for the<br />\nOrchestra is a recent Hopkins<br />\ngraduate,<br />\n_<br />\n_<br />\nRobert Williams (and you thought we all<br />\nbecame doctors!). With no previous<br />\nrecord, the series has managed to sell<br />\nmost of the lower-priced seats already.<br /><br />\n\u2022.<br /><br />\nXSZ<br /><br />\n,<br />\nt%),t St<br />\n177e017C Shrnikir CCl/77e<br /><br />\nalong later to Dirk no the exams.<br /><br />\nfor $2.00. and if even that amount is<br />\ndifficult to raise by concert time,<br />\narrangements can be made. Unlike most<br />\nconcert series, which have student<br />\ndiscounts as a means to fill the house<br />\nafter the regular customers, the \u2022Shriver<br />\nHall series sees the student concert goer<br />\nas the major concern.<br />\nThis year, the Series is attempting<br />\nsomething new, with a January concert<br />\nby violinist Mitchell Stern. Stern, who is<br />\nwithout doubt to become one of the<br />\nbrightest stars of the future, is at present<br />\na student at the Curtis Institute in<br />\nPhiladelphia. He made his debut at age<br />\nfifteen with the Cleveland Orchestra (no<br />\nmean feat, indeed), and the concert will<br />\nbe held<br />\nas a sort of sponsoring by the<br />\nseries. It is the hope of the Series that this<br />\nwill become a staple event of each season,<br />\nthat they may give a promising young<br />\ntalent the exposure he would be unable<br />\nto afford on his own, while still keeping<br />\nthe strict artistic standards it holds for<br />\nthe established artist.<br />\nThe concert will be held on January 8,<br />\n1977, and tickets are free to subscribers,<br />\nand available at a nominal fee to the<br />\ngeneral public. For information on the<br />\nseries, contact Jeanne Feinberg by either<br />\nvisiting Shriver Hall, or calling 338-7164<br />\nor 338-7165.<br />\nAlthough the Shriver Hall Series is<br />\neasily the best as far as the established<br />\nchamber series go, this year marks the<br />\nbeginning of what is sure to become a<br />\nmajor force on the Baltimore musical<br />\nscene. Orchestra Piccolo under the<br />\ndirection of Saul Schechtman.<br />\nMost listeners don't realize it, but the<br />\npresent day orchestra dates only as far<br />\nback as Beethoven and Berlioz. In the<br />\ndays of Mozart, it was common to have<br />\nno more than eight to twelve strings, and<br />\nan almost equal amount of winds. Before<br />\nthat, the average orchestra, a group<br />\nalmost exclusively designed for court and<br />\nchurch playing. consisted of four to six<br />\nviolins , two or three violas. a couple celli<br />\nor gambas, and an occasional doublebass,<br />\nwith a keyboard and optional wind<br />\nplayers. It was for ensembles such as this<br />\nthat such masterworks as Bach's<br />\nBrandenburg Concertos, H a enders<br />\nConcerti Grossi, and Mozart's Serenade in<br />\nG, K. 525 (\"Eine Kleine Nacbtmusik\")<br />\nwere all written for ensembles of this size.<br /><br />\n1,5&lt;,vc.11-lor<br /><br />\nlit<br /><br />\nin inc pietas. or Karl 11,7111-1Cilinger's<br />\nStuttgart Chamber Orchestra will<br /><br />\nMaureen Forrester<br /><br />\nFor those unacquainted with the<br />\nartists. the following is an attempt to<br />\nsketch their strengths and backgrounds.<br />\nContralto Maurren Forrester is one of<br />\nthe most respected concert voices in the<br />\nworld today. Her voice is warm and<br />\nexpressive, and strongly schooled in the<br />\nGerman style. Her recordings range from<br />\nBach to Verdi. but her real strength is<br />\nMahler. She has recorded with such<br />\nmaster conducters as Bruno Walter and<br />\nBernard Haitink, and has a reputation<br />\nwhich, in this era of Mahler-mania, is<br />\nmore than considerable.<br />\nThose interested in the music of String<br />\nQuartets need not be told of the<br />\nQuartetto Italiano's legendary standing.<br />\nTheir meat is the heart of the String<br />\nQuartet's repetoire: the quartets of<br />\nMozart, Beethoven, Brahms, and Haydn.<br />\nThe playing is rich and sonorous, and<br />\ntheir interpretations are often definitive.<br />\nWith a contract with Philips Records,<br />\nthey have recorded most or all of the<br />\nMozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann,<br />\nand Webern Quartets, as well as the Ravel<br />\nand Debussy.<br />\nWhen presented with such an ensemble<br />\nas the Greenhouse Trampler Treger Tri,<br />\none is tempted to think of an all-star<br />\nteam. Surely, it would be difficult to put<br />\ntogether a string trio more perfectly<br />\nmatched than this.<br />\nCellist Bernard Greenhouse, of the<br />\nBeaux Arts Trio (who were at Shriven<br />\nHall last year to perform the complete<br />\nBeethoven Trio cycle) will be joining<br />\nviolist Walter Trampler and violinist<br />\nCharles Treger for what should be a most<br />\nremarkable concert.<br />\nThe Sunday after next, virtuoso cellist<br />\nPierre Fournier will give a recital of cello<br />\nsonatas. One of the world's truly great<br />\ncellists, he is easily among the ranks of<br />\nsuch players as Mstislav Rostropovitch<br />\nand Paul Tortellier. He is no stranger to<br />\nany facet of the literature, and performs<br />\nconcerto and sonata with similar ease. He<br />\nhas recorded the Brahms Double<br />\nConcerto with Oistrakh, as well as the<br />\nDvorak concerto with Szelli. His Bach<br />\nSolo Suites are considered by many to be<br />\nthe definitive performances, and he holds<br />\na prestigious recording contract with the<br />\nDeutches Grammophon label.<br />\nPerhaps the best part of the series is<br />\nthe price. Student tickets can be obtained<br /><br />\nindicate. But the problem live<br />\nperformances lace is the size of a concert<br />\nhall.<br />\nIf you have ever had the misfortune of<br />\nstruggling to hear a major orchestra in a<br />\nhall the \u2022size of the Civic Center, you may<br />\nhave an idea of what a Chamber<br />\nOrchestra sounds like in a normal concert<br />\nhall. The music, as well as the groups,<br />\nwere never intended to play to crowds<br />\nthat large, and so the large hall mentality<br />\nof Americans has been a gross handicap.<br />\nBut when Paul Schechtman happened<br />\nto pass by the newly rennovated Center<br />\nStage, he had a brainstorm. What would<br />\nbe more perfect for a small orchestra than<br />\na small hall, like Center Stage?<br />\nHe knew the idea would not be hard to<br />\nsell to the musical establishment in<br />\nBaltimore, as the Baltimore Symphony's<br />\nSergiu Commisiona had toyed with the<br />\nidea of a Chamber Orchestra himself. It<br />\nwas also easy to find a group of<br />\nbusinessmen eager to build up the City's<br />\ncultural level. The main problem was<br />\nselling it to the concert goers.<br />\nThat would not be hard, if one went<br />\nby the musical reputation of the group.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n,\u20187,1 eeNc. f cycl,<br />\n, \"1-1-1t- 1--\u2022111 frntlIrcm<br /><br />\nthe Mozart Dirertinzento in D, K.251; the<br />\nDvorak Serafiude fit d<br /><br />\nOp. 44;<br /><br />\nHaendel's Concerto Grosso in A rnMor,<br />\nOp. 6-no. 4: and Haydn's Symphony no.<br />\n64 in A.<br />\nFor tickets or more information, call<br />\n235-0666.<br />\nIf chamber music is fine by you, but<br />\nyou are more interested in choral music,<br />\nthen don't despair.

He then was<br />\nappointed assistant conductor of the<br />\nArmy Chorus, and was chorus master for<br />\nthe Washington Opera Society for two<br />\nyears: He is now the Director of Choral<br />\nMusic at the Peabody Conservatory.<br />\nMorrison has managed to do (One well<br />\nwith his group. especially when you<br /><br />\nconsider that they have no real concert<br />\nhome. Their concerts are held at local<br />\nchurches, as well as Goucher's Kraushaar<br />\nAuditorium (their principal hall), and the<br />\nPeabody Concert Hall.<br />\nThe strength of the group is, or course,<br />\nthe singers, and when you listen to the<br />\nChoral Arts Society, it is hard to believe<br />\nthat they are not a full-time professional<br />\ngroup which is just passing through town.<br />\nThey tend, in fact, to be too good, which<br />\nis why the inadequacies of the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony chorus seem so embarrassing.<br />\nThis may be because of Morrison's<br />\nuncanny ability with unknown talents.<br />\nTake, for example, soprano Rhonda<br />\nJarrell, an unknown when she joined<br />\nchoral arts last year, who was given a<br />\nsmall solo last year, and her talents were<br />\nso apparent that she is one of the<br />\nfeatured soloists in this year's Christmas<br />\nconTcheert,garotuKpr,as<br />\na<br />\nnext cr-oncert is December<br />\n21st, at Kraushaar.

Over 90<br />\npercent of the play took place<br />\nwell within the Washington end<br />\nof the field as the Jays outshot<br />\ntheir opponents 38-13. In fact, in<br />\nthe 20 minute overtime period,<br />\nthe Washington hooters fired<br />\nonly one shot\u2014a shot that cost<br />\nthe Blue Jays a share of the<br />\nleague championship.<br />\nThe key to the Washington<br />\nvictory had to be the superb<br />\nperformance of their goalie who<br />\nseemed to stop each shot that<br />\nwas fired by the Jay attackmen.<br />\n\"Their goalie was definitely<br />\nriding a lucky streak today,\"<br />\ncommented senior co-captain<br />\nTom Myrick. \"Most of the shots<br />\nhe stopped he probably could<br />\nnot have seen until the last<br />\nsecond. It was a case of him<br />\nbeing in the right place at the<br />\nright time.\"<br /><br />\nThe Blue Jays took the lead<br />\nabout ten minutes into the first<br />\nhalf. Myrick took advantage of a<br />\nthrow in opportunity by<br />\nsending a lofted feed right in<br />\nfront of the Washington net.<br />\nThere, winger Larry McGowan<br />\nput his head to the ball and sent<br />\nit into the upper corner of the<br />\ncage.<br />\nMinutes later the game was<br />\ntied by Washington College. The<br />\nplay actually developed in the<br />\nWashington end of the field with<br />\nthe Jay offense applying fierce<br />\npressure. A defensive back, in<br />\ncomplete desperationi, sent a<br />\nclearing pass that was scooped up<br />\nby an alert opposing winger.<br />\nI<br />\nUnfortunately for the Jays<br />\nonly one defender was in<br />\nposition, sweeper back Frank<br />\nOlszewski, and he was unable to<br />\nreceiving more opportunities in<br />\nstop the threat.

As the two<br />\nbodies crashed together the ball<br />\nwas pushed into the net. And<br />\napproximately 40 seconds later<br />\nthe horn sounded ending the Jay<br />\nseason in disappointment.<br /><br />\nThe team ends this year's<br />\nplay with a 5-5-1 record. Two<br />\ngames that were rained out wilt<br />\nnot be made up.<br />\nThough this season was one of<br />\ndisappointment, the Jays played<br />\nstrong and exciting soccer. Often<br />\nriddled with injuries and bad luck ,<br />\nthe team just couldn't win the<br />\nimportant games. BY all '<br />\nstatistical measurement, the Blue<br />\nJays should be sitting on top of<br />\ntheir league right now. But in this<br />\nstrange game of soccer, it is the<br />\nbounce of the ball that counts<br />\nthe most. And all too often for<br />\nthe Jays, the ball just didn t<br />\nbounce their way.<br /><br />\nFootballers tied 16-16<br /><br />\nJays disappointed but not crushed after Swarthmore<br />\nFor Blue Jay football fans,<br />\nthere can only be one word used<br />\nto describe Saturday afternoon's<br />\n1 6-1 6 tie with Swarthmore<br />\nCollege: frustrating.<br />\nFrustrating; because<br />\nSwarthmore turned the ball over<br />\nto. the Blue Jays eight times (six<br />\nfumbles and two pass<br />\ninterceptions), but Hopkins<br />\ncould not take advantage of any<br />\nof these opportunities.<br />\nFrustrating because<br /><br />\nSwarthmore's second touchdown<br />\nwas scored when a JHU quick<br />\nkick was blocked and recovered<br />\nin the end zone.<br />\nAnd finally, the ultimate<br />\nmoment of frustration: as the<br />\ngame's final gun sounded, the<br />\nJays were on the Garnet one-yard<br />\nline and just inches away from<br />\nvictory.<br />\nThe Homewood elei,en had<br />\nbegun the game as if they were<br />\ngoing to run their Pennsylvania<br /><br />\nContest<br />\nGuess the score of the Hopkins vs:Dickinson Football Game<br />\nMy guess is<br />\n(Dickinson)<br />\n(Hopkins\",<br />\nWinner receives a cas, of Beck's imported beer and a handsome<br />\nBeck's beer mug.<br />\nName<br />\nAddress.<br />\ncertify that I am 18 years or older.<br />\nFill out and bring to News-Letter Office or mail to Box 1230 no later<br />\nthan Thursday.

Con ratulations.<br /><br />\nhosts into the Delaware River.<br />\nAfter receiving the opening<br />\nkickoff, the Jays marcher?<br />\nseventy-five yards in seven<br />\nplays with halfback John<br />\nRailley covering the final<br />\nthirty-six yards for the<br />\ntouchdown. Quarterback Tom<br />\nBender then hit Dave Emala with<br />\nthe two-point conversion pass<br />\nand Hopkins had a quick 8-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nOn the ensuing series of plays,<br />\nSwarthmore fumbled and the<br />\nalert Jay defense recovered at the<br />\nGarnet 18-yard line. However,<br />\nthe JHU offensive unit was<br />\nunable to move the ball and the<br />\nhost team regained possession<br />\nwhen a fourth down play did not<br />\npick up the required yardage.<br />\nThis defensive stand seemed to<br />\ninspire the Swarthmore offense.<br />\nStarting at their own ten-yard<br />\nline, the Pennsylvanians moved<br />\ndownfield on the ground to a<br />\nfirst down at the Blue Jay<br />\nforty-six. One play later, a<br />\nGarnet running back broke clear<br />\ninto the secondary and outraced<br />\nthe Hopkins defense to the end<br />\nzone. The two-point conversion<br />\nattempt was good and the score<br />\nstood at 8-8.<br />\nThe remainder of the first half<br />\nwas a battle of the punters. The<br />\nteams accumulated only five first<br />\ndowns in the entire quarter while<br />\nneither offense was able to move<br />\nto within thirty yards of the<br />\nopposing goal line.<br />\nThe opening of the second half<br />\nbrought a rebirth of the offensive<br />\npart of the game. Swarthmore<br />\ntook the opening kick-off and<br />\nseemed determined to break the<br /><br />\ntic. Beginning at their forty-one,<br />\nthe Garnets put together a<br />\nsustained drive and moved to a<br />\nfirst down at the Blue Jay one<br />\nyard line.<br />\nHowever, a fumbled snap on<br />\nthe next play was recovered by<br />\nHopkins and the Homewood<br />\noffense went to work from the<br />\ntwo yard line. A pair of running<br />\nplays produced negligible gains<br />\nand so \u2022 a quick kick was<br />\nattempted on.third down.<br />\nUnfortunately for the Jays,<br />\ntheir hosts realized what was<br />\ncoming and rushed through to<br />\nblock the kick. The ball was<br />\nfallen upon by a Swarthmore<br />\ndefender in the end zone for a<br />\ntouchdown. A successful two<br />\npoint conversion followed and<br />\nsuddenly JHU found itself on the<br />\nshort end of a 16-8 score.<br />\nHopkins moved quickly to tie<br />\nthe score. Taking the following<br />\nkick-off at their thirty-five yard<br />\nline, the Blue Jays rediscovered<br />\nthe forward pass (they hadn't<br />\ncompleted a pass in the first half)<br />\nand marched downfield on the<br />\nstrength of Tom Bender's right<br />\narm.<br />\nOn a fourth and four situation<br />\nfrom the Swarthmore twelve<br />\nyard line, Bender hit tight end<br />\nMike Rhodey with a pass and<br />\nRhodey rambled untouched into<br />\nthe end zone. The final points of<br />\nthe afternoon were scored<br />\nmoments later as Bob Geist took<br />\na Bender aerial and, on an<br />\nexcellent second effort, went<br />\nacross the goal line for the<br />\ntwo-point conversion, biiiiging<br />\nthe count to 16-16.<br />\nFrom that point on. the Jays<br /><br />\nwere in complete control of the<br />\ncontest although they could<br />\nnever find the Points that would<br />\nhave given them the victory. The<br />\ndefense allowed only one Garnet<br />\nfirst down after the score was<br />\ntied and gave the Jay offense the<br />\nball four times through recovered<br />\nturnovers.<br />\nMeanwhile, the JHU offense<br />\nwas able to move the ball, but<br />\nnever quite far e nough.<br />\nlast<br />\nEpitomizing this was the<br />\nBlue Jay offensive effort of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThis final opportunity clinic<br />\nminutes<br />\nwith less than two<br />\nremaining in the game, as JaY<br />\nCoulter<br />\ndefensive back Brian<br />\npicked off a pass and returned it<br />\nto the Swarthmore forty-three. P'<br />\npass interference penalty and 3<br />\nfourth down Bender to DIP<br />\ncompletion gave the Jays a firsAt<br />\ndown on the Garnet ten Yall)<br />\nline.<br />\nA second down pass to Geist<br />\ncarried to the one yard line. but<br />\ntwo final plays produced no gaill<br />\nand time ran out with the JaYs<br />\ninches away from their third will<br />\nof the season.<br />\n\"I was disappointed but Al<br />\nwasn't crushed,\" Blue Jay hea\"<br />\ncoach Dennis Cox said after the<br />\ngame. \"I think our offense .51<br />\nimproving, but we have<br />\nimproved enough.
