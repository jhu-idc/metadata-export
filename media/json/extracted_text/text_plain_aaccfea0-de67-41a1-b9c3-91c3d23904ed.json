Since it<br />\nis the first Fall Break, it will<br />\nperhaps not be \"a real measure<br />\nof what Fall Break can be,\"<br />\nsaid Savitz.

During the semester, interns meet in a seminar every<br />\ntwo weeks, where they discuss<br />\nreadings on state and local<br />\ngovernment, as well as their<br />\nown experiences in government. A paper on some aspect<br />\nof the legislative process due at<br />\nthe end of the semester is also<br />\nrequired. Students receive a<br />\n<br />\ntotal of five academic credits<br />\nfor their work in the program.<br />\nBoth the state and local internships begin in January with<br />\nan orientation program designed to introduce students to the<br />\nlegislative body to which they<br />\nhave been assigned. Several<br />\nlegislators speak on such basics<br />\nas committee structure, how a<br />\nbill is drafted and becomes law,<br />\nand the relationship between<br />\nthe legislative and executive<br />\nbranches.<br />\nBeginning in the second semester, students are assigned<br />\nreadings on state and local<br />\ngovernment that are designed<br />\nto complement their work experiences. The readings vary<br />\nfrom traditional political theory<br />\nto analyses of contemporary<br />\npolitics. The readings explore<br />\nsuch topics as the nature of the<br />\nurban machine, the role of<br />\ncommunity groups in government, and legislative reform.<br />\nApplications for the Curriculum for Political Leadership<br />\nare available in Room D-1 of<br />\nthe Metro Center(basement of<br />\nShriver).

It attempted to slow down<br />\nand channel arms productions<br />\nto less dangerous weapons.<br />\n\"Neither SALT agreement is<br />\ntechnically enforced,\" stated<br />\nTalbott,\"SALT I expired eight<br />\nyears ago and SALT II was<br />\nnever ratified by the US<br />\nCongress.\"<br />\nTalbott then spoke of more<br />\ncurrent developments, saying,<br />\n\"Although President Reagan<br />\ncampaigned against SALT II,<br />\nhis objections had little to do<br />\nwith the treaty.

That issue<br />\nwas brought to the fore last year by the<br />\ncreation of the HOP, which was designed to coordinate all social programming<br />\non campus. Since the HOP's birth, programming by the classes has declined<br />\nsharply.<br />\nThat has caused some members of the<br />\nCouncil to argue that the classes require<br />\nless money than they used to. That, in<br />\nturn, has caused almost all of the class<br />\nofficers to worry that their budgets might<br />\nbe slashed. The current move to review<br />\nfunding, for example, came from Senior<br />\nClass Representative Alison Little, a<br />\nlong-time defender of the classes'<br />\nposition.<br />\nLittle argues that classes sponsor fewer<br />\nsocial events than they used to because,<br />\nsince they can't sell beer, they can't make<br />\nmoney. Three or four years ago, she<br />\n<br />\nsays, class parties at least broke even,<br />\nallowing the classes to sponsor a lot of<br />\nevents and still have an adequate kitty<br />\nfor graduation.<br />\nWhy the Council made such an aboutface isn't exactly clear. The public reason<br />\nis that the original charge of the committee was too vague. A little specification<br />\ncould obviously have been added, but instead the Council decided to ask the<br />\nHOP and the SAC to review their own<br />\nfunding procedures and report to the<br />\nCouncil if they find any problems. That<br />\nis absurdly naive. Those are the two<br />\norganizations which the classes claim are<br />\nthe problem. (That point caused Little<br />\nto say what is undoubtedly the Quote of<br />\nthe Year:\"To tell the SAC and the HOP<br />\nto examine themselves is also vague, not<br />\nto mention extremely kinky.\")<br />\nWe're not exactly sure the committee<br />\ncreated two weeks ago was the right vehicle to examine funding. (It was to be<br />\nchaired by Little, for example; a more<br />\nimpartial Council member would be a<br />\nbetter choice.) But the fact is that the<br />\nclasses have a point\u2014funding in the<br />\nHOP era needs to be reexamined.<br />\n<br />\nIs College Boring?<br />\nIn an extraordinary moment of candor for the American educational<br />\nestablishment, a recent report on<br />\nundergraduate education in this country<br />\nnotes that often college \"is boring, particularly the classroom part.\" We at<br />\nHopkins ought to take that to heart.<br />\nThe report was issued by the Carnegie<br />\nFoundation for the Advancement of<br />\nTeaching, and was written by Frank<br />\nNewman, president of the Education<br />\nCommission of the States. It discusses a<br />\nbroad range of issues facing American<br />\nhigher education\u2014everything from<br />\nfinancial aid to improving scientific<br />\nresearch. But the report's most interesting section\u2014and, at least from a<br />\nHopkins standpoint, its most relevant\u2014<br />\ndeals with ways to develop an educational system which will engender more<br />\ncreativity and civic involvement among<br />\nstudents. Students around here are<br />\nrenowned for lacking both.<br />\nNewman points out that the lack of<br />\ncreativity displayed by many of today's<br />\nstudents is the fault of the university:<br />\n\"Students too frequently sit passively in<br />\nclass, take safe courses, are discouraged<br />\nfrom risky or interdisciplinary research<br />\nprojects, and are discouraged from<br />\nchallenging the ideas presented to them.\"<br />\nSimilarly, universities have no one but<br />\nthemselves to blame for the obvious(and<br />\nmuch discussed) lack of civic interest<br />\nshown by their students. Newman points<br />\nout that instilling a greater sense of civic<br />\nresponsibility in students requires that<br />\nuniversities accept a role far broader than<br />\nthe mere mastery of knowledge\u2014they<br />\nmust inculcate values. \"For the first two<br />\ncenturies of American higher education,<br />\nthe development of the character of the<br />\n<br />\nstudent was seen as the central task of<br />\nthe administration and faculty. For the<br />\nlast half century, it has declined in priority....there is little evidence to indicate<br />\nthat colleges and universities are interested, let alone effective, in encouraging value development.\"<br />\nSo what is the solution? How can<br />\nuniversities cause their students to<br />\nbecome both more creative and less<br />\napathetic about civic concerns? The<br />\nreport offers an answer: \"The student<br />\nmust become more actively involved in<br />\nhis or her own learning. Far too often,<br />\nstudents are treated as the object of learning rather than as colleagues in the learning process.\" To accomplish that, the<br />\nreport suggests several specific remedies,<br />\nincluding expanded internships and national service opportunities.<br />\nWhile we think a full solution would<br />\nrequire somewhat more radical action,<br />\nNewman's recommendations are worth<br />\nlooking at, particularly for Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br />\nWhat other university is so brilliant an<br />\nexample of the problems he illustrates?<br />\nWe have a faculty that is uninterested (at<br />\ntimes it seems almost disinterested) in<br />\nteaching, and students who not only lack<br />\ncreativity (except perhaps in ways to<br />\ncompete)and utterly unconcerned about<br />\ncivic issues. Most undergrads here do<br />\nnothing more than learn chemical equations by rote and can barely tell you<br />\nwho's Secretary of State.<br />\nThe Newman report doesn't represent<br />\na complete solution to the problems<br />\nplaguing American higher education, but<br />\nit is at least a recognition that they exist. That's a good sign, particularly for<br />\na school like Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI attended the WJHU general<br />\nmeeting on Wednesday, October 2, at which David Creagh<br />\nspoke. The article in last week's<br />\nNews-Letter raised some points<br />\nthat should be clarified.<br />\nIt is true that there will be<br />\nthree part-time positions<br />\ntargeted towards students.<br />\nHowever, these positions do<br />\nnot involve producing programs on the air. These positions are an engineering assistant, a record librarian, and an<br />\nadministrative liaison (an \"ambassador to certain departments<br />\nof the University.\").<br />\nAccording to this article,<br />\nCreagh feels that his policy of<br />\ndisregarding whether applicants<br />\nare students will not hurt the<br />\nstudents' position, as \"many<br />\nstudents and community people<br />\nwho I have heard were extremely impressive.\"<br />\nNevertheless, professional<br />\napplicants have a significant advantage over others applying<br />\nfor positions at the radio station. By their very nature, professional practices such as<br />\n\"horizontal continuity\" (i.e.<br />\none person occupies the same<br />\ntime slot all week), which<br />\nCreagh brought up at the<br />\nmeeting, discriminate against<br />\nstudents. Working at a<br />\nprofessionally-managed radio<br />\nstation is a full-time job. How<br />\nmany students can afford to<br />\nspend four hours a day, five<br />\ndays a week at a station?<br />\nIn short, the days of the<br />\nstudent-run WJHU are over. In<br />\nits place will be a new 25,000<br />\nwatt station, of perhaps national significance. We can on-<br />\n<br />\nly hope for some room for<br />\nstudents at such a station.<br />\nThe administration of this<br />\nuniversity should re-examine its<br />\npriorities. What is the purpose<br />\nof WJHU, if not to provide<br />\nstudents and other community<br />\nmembers with the opportunity<br />\nto operate and manage the<br />\noutstanding radio station that<br />\nBaltimore magazine voted<br />\n\"Baltimore's Best\"?

The author<br />\nrejects affirmative action programs that would equalize the<br />\nratio between male and female<br />\nemployees in comparable jobs,<br />\nin the interest of \"treating both<br />\nsexes equally.\"<br />\nWhat Chen does not seem to<br />\nrealize is that without a program committed to achieving<br />\nparity of the sexes in employment, this institution, like all<br />\nmale-dominated systems, will<br />\n<br />\ncontinue to view women as inadequate and sub-standard. As<br />\nChen states, academia has been<br />\ntraditionally labelled a male<br />\nsystem, and only a few extraordinary women \"have been able<br />\nto transcend this gap.\" But<br />\nnow, according to the author,<br />\nsince universities have opened<br />\ntheir doors to women, \"the<br />\nnumber of females represented<br />\nin both faculty and student<br />\npopulation will increase on its<br />\nown.\" This type of thinking is<br />\nan outrage. It is similar to the<br />\nvirulently racist notion expressed by the dominant group in<br />\nsociety regarding the oppressed<br />\ngroups in which the dominant<br />\ngroup rejects any favoritism<br />\ntowards the oppressed group in<br />\nhiring, public assistance, health<br />\ncare, etc. The feeling stated by<br />\nthe dominant is \"I made it on<br />\nmy own without any help from<br />\nanyone, why can't he (or in this<br />\ncase, she)?<br />\nThe answer is that the oppressed group has many factors<br />\nstacked against it that stand in<br />\nthe way of achieving success,<br />\nthat is, achieving equality with<br />\nthe dominant group. In the case<br />\nof women, it is the paternalistic<br />\nvalues of society that prevent<br />\nwomen from acquiring tenured<br />\npositions and policy-making<br />\njobs in male-dominated<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nGiven this obstruction, why<br />\nshouldn't there be affirmative<br />\naction policies at this university? I find Joe Chen's argument<br />\nthat an affirmative action<br />\npolicy would favor one side<br />\n(women) over another side<br />\n(men) to be a sexist tactic<br />\nthat does not consider the extenuating circumstances surrounding such a policy. As he<br />\nstates himself, a few extraordinary women have managed to<br />\ntranscend the gap. And that's<br />\nwhat a woman must be if she is<br />\n<br />\nto succeed in a male<br />\ninstitution\u2014out of the ordinary. She has to prove herself<br />\nto be better than all the men<br />\ncompeting for the same job.<br />\nChen apparently sees nothing<br />\nwrong with this. I certainly do.<br />\nAnd if society refuses to change<br />\nits paternalistic values in favor<br />\nof more humanitarian ones,<br />\nand if the only way to alleviate<br />\nunfair hiring practices is affirmative action, I support it.<br />\n<br />\nLetter Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editor.

The average<br />\nage in my class is 27. \"She has<br />\na baby with her.\" \"His son just<br />\ngraduated from Ohio State!\"<br />\nBut enough said, for after all,<br />\nS.A.I.S. is a graduate school<br />\nand such things must be<br />\nexpected.<br />\nAs one of three A.B.-M.A.<br />\nstudents beginning at S.A.I.S.<br />\nthis year, I am discovering the<br />\njoys and agonies of a graduate<br />\ninstitution. There are less than<br />\n100 students in their first year,<br />\nout of over 1200 applicants,<br />\nand they truly represent an extraordinary gamut of personalities, cultures, and<br />\nbackgrounds. My classmates<br />\nsixty<br />\nover<br />\nrepresent<br />\nundergraduate institutions.<br />\n65% have spent time outside of<br />\nthe States, and their average<br />\nGPA from college is 3.5. One<br />\ncannot escape the feeling that<br />\nthe person in the next desk<br />\n'could probably explain more<br />\nabout the political structure of<br />\nNepal than the consul himself.<br />\nSo why exactly does one stray<br />\nfrom Homewood to that<br />\npolitical city 37 miles<br />\nsouthwest?<br />\nA great incentive is<br />\nWashington itself. Where else<br />\nto pursue international relations and have a wealth of<br />\nnightlife on hand at the same<br />\ntime?<br />\nall<br />\nYou<br />\nknow<br />\nGeorgetown, but there are<br />\nplaces other than St Elmo's'<br />\nwhich burn with excitement.<br />\nLest I forget, education is the<br />\nessential reason for attending<br />\nS.A.I.S.<br />\nNot all people here know<br />\nwhat they want to do after their<br />\ntwo years, and many are still<br />\ndeciding on their areas of concentration. Moreover, not all<br />\nare equally adept in the subject<br />\nareas offered. For instance, an<br />\noverwhelming majority of the<br />\nentering class was advised to<br />\ntake \"Basic Math for Social<br />\nSciences.\" With perhaps that<br />\none exception, images of eighth<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of News and Information<br />\n<br />\nGreg Pease<br />\n<br />\ngrade are quite remote. Course<br />\nsize varies a lot. My French<br />\nclass has four people, while<br />\nTrade Theory overflows into<br />\nthe hallway. Perhaps the<br />\ngreatest difference from<br />\nHomewood is that all classes<br />\nmeet once a week for two<br />\nhours, except for languages,<br />\nwhich meet for a minimum of<br />\n5 hours/ week at all levels. At<br />\nthis point in one's education,<br />\nthere is no shame about how<br />\nmuch reading is doled out.<br />\nWhatever happened to those<br />\nnice \"little\" assignments I<br />\nknew so well?<br />\n\"Grad\" students at S.A.I.S.<br />\ndo not resemble the folks you<br />\nremember from the sixties<br />\nbefore they underwent the \"Big<br />\nChill,\" but rather tend to take<br />\non the appearance of \"St.<br />\n<br />\nElmo's\" graduates after the<br />\nfire. Men show up in everything<br />\nfrom gray suits and wingtips to<br />\nEurowear or Levis. Women<br />\ntend to dress with ample flair,<br />\nand show no signs of the<br />\nfamiliar freshman fifteen,<br />\nperhaps because they have had<br />\na few years without dorm type<br />\nchow. It is definitely refreshing<br />\nand enjoyable to look elsewhere<br />\nthan just the blackboard when<br />\nin a lecture.<br />\nS.A.I.S. seems to be a nine to<br />\nfive type place, and looks like<br />\nan office building, which can be<br />\na little difficult to adjust to<br />\nafter 24 hour campus life.<br />\nClasses meet at 8:30 am and<br />\nthen again from 3 pm onward.<br />\nThe time in between is reserved for mandatory language<br />\ncourses which are very tedious.<br />\n<br />\nImagine having French both<br />\nbefore and after lunch in the<br />\nsame day.<br />\nMany professors share some<br />\nof the same habits as those at<br />\nHomewood (unable to advise<br />\nyou, rather self-devoted). Yet<br />\nthey break the mold of typical<br />\naloofness because they provide<br />\nunique insights about their experiences and friends (I have a<br />\nprofessor who is a good friend<br />\nof Japan's Prime Minister<br />\nNakasone). The advantages of<br />\na S.A.I.S. education make one<br />\nfeel just a bit less guilty about<br />\nspending the equivalent of a<br />\nSaab each year.<br />\nSome parting words are in<br />\norder if you plan to come here.<br />\nAvoid the mandatory lunch<br />\ncafeteria tickets if at all possible (claim culture shock). Don't<br />\n<br />\nlet the croissants and pita bread<br />\nsandwiches fool you (and it's<br />\nnot even ARA!). I also must<br />\nmention that most people here<br />\nknow the word \"party.\" On<br />\nFridays at 5 you can find a majority of students unwinding at<br />\nthe school's customary happy<br />\nhour with their Heinekens and<br />\nBud Lights. These happy hours<br />\ntend to extend throughout the<br />\nweekend.<br />\nS.A.I.S. is nice, but then I<br />\nsay this with only a few weeks<br />\nfrom which to judge. Yet impressions are convincing.<br />\nThat's all for now from D.C.<br />\nuntil I provide details on D.C.'s<br />\ncosmopolitan nightlife which<br />\nyou too can partake in. (Yes,<br />\nthe age for most places is 18.<br />\nPut the free shuttle to S.A.I.S.<br />\nto good use.)<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/15<br />\n<br />\nCrossword<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n12<br />\n<br />\n31<br />\n<br />\n32<br />\n<br />\n56<br />\n<br />\n57<br />\n<br />\nby Ron DeMatte\u00b0<br />\n16<br />\n<br />\n15<br />\n<br />\n14<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\nACROSS<br />\n1.<br />\n4.<br />\n9.<br />\n13.<br />\n15.<br />\n16.<br />\n17.<br />\n20.<br />\n21.<br />\n22.<br />\n23.<br />\n25.<br />\n29.<br />\n33.<br />\n34.<br />\n35.<br />\n<br />\n36.<br />\n41.<br />\n42.<br />\n43.<br />\n44.<br />\n46.<br />\n49.<br />\n50.<br />\n51.<br />\n53.<br />\n58.<br />\n61.<br />\n62.<br />\n63.<br />\n64.<br />\n65.<br />\n66.<br />\n<br />\nBrooks, for one<br />\nPatty Duke follower<br />\nA humor<br />\nSmall case<br />\nWouk's mutiny<br />\nSale saying<br />\nWhere it's every man for<br />\nhimself<br />\nUniform motions<br />\nLBJ, once<br />\nExplosive<br />\nLadder, in Liverpool<br />\nWinners<br />\nVoltaire, for Arouet<br />\nHair style<br />\nLand unit<br />\nScale notes<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n12<br />\n<br />\n25<br />\n<br />\n20<br />\n<br />\n24<br />\n<br />\n25<br />\n<br />\n29<br />\n<br />\n28<br />\n<br />\n43<br />\n<br />\n42<br />\n<br />\n47<br />\n<br />\n3i<br />\n<br />\n32<br />\n<br />\n51<br />\n<br />\n52<br />\n<br />\n53<br />\n<br />\n44<br />\n<br />\n46<br />\n<br />\n45<br />\n<br />\n54<br />\n<br />\n3i<br />\n.<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n39<br />\n<br />\n48<br />\n<br />\n50<br />\n<br />\n49<br />\n<br />\n55<br />\n<br />\n57<br />\n<br />\n56<br />\n<br />\n58<br />\n<br />\n61<br />\n<br />\n61<br />\n<br />\n62<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n30<br />\n<br />\n29<br />\n<br />\n28<br />\n<br />\n35<br />\n<br />\n34<br />\n<br />\n37<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n42<br />\n<br />\n44<br />\n<br />\n51<br />\n<br />\n40<br />\n<br />\n39<br />\n<br />\n38<br />\n<br />\n36<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n45<br />\n<br />\n46<br />\n<br />\n49<br />\n<br />\n50<br />\n<br />\n47<br />\n<br />\n43<br />\n<br />\n48<br />\n<br />\n54<br />\n<br />\n53<br />\n<br />\n52<br />\n<br />\n58<br />\n<br />\n59<br />\n<br />\n61<br />\n<br />\n62<br />\n<br />\n63<br />\n<br />\n64<br />\n<br />\n65<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n55<br />\n<br />\n60<br />\n<br />\nDOWN<br />\n19.

In theory, at least, this<br />\nis not the truth. Believe it or<br />\nnot, there is a definite<br />\nschedule\u2014blocks of music at<br />\nthe same time every week. The<br />\nbasics are as follows:<br />\nClassical: 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.<br />\nweekdays<br />\nProgressive Rock: 9 p.m. to<br />\n6 a.m. weeknights (except<br />\nThursday, and Fridays 1 a.m. to<br />\n6 a.m.) and Saturdays from 2<br />\np.m. to 8:30 p.m.<br />\nJazz: 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.<br />\nweekdays and all day and night<br />\non Sunday<br />\nNot Available Radio<br />\n(N.A.R.\u2014a step beyond rock,<br />\njazz, and/or classical): 9 p.m.<br />\nto 6 a.m. Thursday, 1 a.m. to<br />\n6 a.m. Friday night, and 8:30<br />\np.m. to 6 a.m. Saturday nights.<br />\nSo there you have it...<br />\nUnfortunately, the remaining<br />\ntime slots are not as easy to<br />\nclear up. From after the 5:30<br />\nNews until 9 p.m., for example,<br />\nthere seems to be a general<br />\nmish-mash\u2014from reggae to<br />\nnews programs to 60's music to<br />\nart discussion shows. Well,<br />\nbelieve it or not, there is a<br />\nsystem here, too. 6-7 p.m.<br />\nweekdays is the time set apart<br />\nfor \"Educational Programming\"\u2014consisting of weekly<br />\neducational shows or public affairs programs. 7-9 p.m.<br />\nweeknights and 6 a.m. to 2<br />\np.m. on Saturday is set aside<br />\nfor \"special programming\"\u2014<br />\ni.e., types of music that have no<br />\nother outlets on WJHU,or the<br />\narea, for that matter. The<br />\nfollowing list is thus a guide to<br />\nweekly and bi-weekly programs<br />\non WJHU. Hopefully this will<br />\nstraighten out matters a bit.<br />\n<br />\nAmerican music and musicians,<br />\nwhether it is Clifton Chenier,<br />\nKing of Zydeco, or Charlie<br />\nParker, King of the Saxophone.<br />\nTUESDAY 7-9 p.m.<br />\nThe Long Note: A show<br />\nhosted by Bob Rickert, Frank<br />\nClaudy and friends featuring<br />\nthe best in new and old Irish (or<br />\nCeltic) music.

On<br />\n1982's Lexicon ofLove, he was<br />\na suave Bryan Ferry clone,<br />\nfrom the world-weary view of<br />\nromance propagated in his<br />\nclever lyrics, down to the wedge<br />\nof his haircut. Lexicon was<br />\na smash, spawning hit singles in<br />\n\"Look of Love\" and \"Poison<br />\nArrow\"; the formula of<br />\nromance gone wrong set to<br />\nlavish instrumentation and a<br />\ndance beat seemed so obviously right for ABC that their second LP, Beauty Stab, remains<br />\nan outright mystery.<br />\nOn this album, Fry ditched<br />\nhis second-generation Roxy<br />\nMusic roots and tried to<br />\nbecome an AOR hero. Instead<br />\nof synths and strings, Beauty<br />\nStab was best characterized by<br />\nthe ripping guitar intro to<br />\nDangerous<br />\nA<br />\n\"Love's<br />\nLanguage\" and the dark<br />\ncynicism of the words to<br />\n\"United Kingdom\" and \"Unzip.\" The LP confused ABC<br />\nfans from the Lexicon days,<br />\nand was bought by few of<br />\nthem.<br />\nABC laid low in 1984, but<br />\nnow they've reemerged as\u2014<br />\ncartoon characters? Maybe the<br />\nanimated LP cover and videos<br />\nare to let us know that they've<br />\nlightened up and brightened<br />\ntheir sound. You can definitely dance to How To Be A<br />\nZillionaire! It's as if Beauty<br />\nStab had never occurred.<br />\nGuitars are extremely scarce on<br />\nZillionaire; ABC is back to<br />\nFairlights and other high<br />\ntechnology instruments.<br />\n<br />\nIt was a wise decision.<br />\nAlthough I was one of about<br />\nten people in the world who actually liked Beauty Stab<br />\nonce I got over the shock, I<br />\ndecided the songs were really<br />\npretty good\u2014ABC seems born<br />\nto do numbers like \"Be Near<br />\nMe.\" Let others handle guitarladen rock; dance-pop doesn't<br />\nget much better than this.<br />\nIronically, \"Be Near Me\"<br />\nwas written back in the Lexicon<br />\ndays, and is certainly their best<br />\nshot at a hit single. It seems<br />\nradio-perfect\u2014it doesn't have<br />\nthe heavy funk bottom of the<br />\nother Zillionaire songs. Instead,<br />\nit bounces lightly along, Fry's<br />\nplaintive vocal punctuated by<br />\npizzicatoed strings and an oftrepeated keyboard riff.<br />\nIf \"Be Near Me\" does break<br />\nthrough commercially, it will be<br />\ninteresting to see what an ABC<br />\ntour would look like. Only two<br />\noriginal members remain, Fry<br />\nand synthesist Mark White; the<br />\nother half of ABC, a platinum<br />\nblonde name Eden and a bald<br />\nmidget from Texas, seemingly<br />\nadd nothing to the band except<br />\ntheir videogenicity. They don't<br />\neven do backing vocals,<br />\nalthough Eden does contribute<br />\none unforgettable line to the<br />\nbeatbox workout \"A to Z.\"<br />\nMaybe they can learn to play<br />\ntamborines before they play<br />\nlive, so they can at least appear<br />\nuseful.<br />\nA fair number of guest musicians, including ex-Squeeze<br />\nman Don Snow, add to the<br />\nsonic brew. Horns and cello<br />\nhighlight the swinging \"15<br />\nStorey Halo,\" and female<br />\nbackup vocals are prominent<br />\nis-Vo.<br />\n<br />\nboitbdei\u2018<br />\n'<br />\n,-0.0\u2022111%.\u2022tiP4r\"4001101111.\"<br />\n\u2022110eWN...<br />\n604its,<br />\n<br />\non several tracks, including \"So<br />\nHip It Hurts.\" This song seemingly borrows a bubbling percussion effect from Isaac<br />\nHayes' old \"Shaft\" theme, and<br />\nthere are plenty of soulful<br />\n\"yeah's from the backup<br />\nsingers. The lyrics are also<br />\nnostalgic in nature\u2014\"Do you<br />\nremember when men wore<br />\nskirts?...Afro wigs on albino<br />\nsquares, solar powered electric<br />\nchairs...\"<br />\nUnfortunately, the album<br />\nversion of \"Vanity Kills\" seems<br />\nsadly truncated after the terrific<br />\nextended mix (available on import 12\"). The same goes for<br />\n\"Be Near Me,\" which was at its<br />\nbest in the longer \"Munich<br />\nDisco Mix\" (another import<br />\n12\"). These dance-club<br />\nfavorites are too good to last<br />\nonly three and a half minutes.<br />\nThe other quibble I have with<br />\nthis album is that \"Fear of the<br />\nWorld,\" the opener, is weak,<br />\nresorting to copping a melodic<br />\nline from Depeche Mode's<br />\n\"People are People.\" It's interesting to note that the track's<br />\n\"guitar solo\" was actually<br />\ncourtesy of a Fairlight synthesizer, though.<br />\nStill, there's plenty of music<br />\non Zillionaire that pleases\u2014a<br />\ncouple of lovely midtempo<br />\ntunes, \"Ocean Blue\" and \"Between You and Me\"; the rollicking \"15 Storey Halo\" and the<br />\nharder groove of \"Tower of<br />\nLondon,\" to name a few examples. ABC may now be<br />\nanimated (if this LP is a real<br />\nsmash, will they get their own<br />\nSaturday morning cartoon<br />\nshow?), but Zillionaire is<br />\nserious fun.<br />\n4\u00f6#,,4,0*.4<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/17<br />\nI screwed up.<br />\nWell I certainly messed up last<br />\nweek; I can't even blame midterms for my state of absentmindedness...so without further ado\u2014the corrections to<br />\nlast week's Arts Calendar (not<br />\nthat it makes a hell of a difference now):<br />\nThe Weekend Wonder Flix<br />\nand Senior Class Film Series are<br />\nFriday and Saturday nights and<br />\nalways will be, and are not on<br />\n\"Sat. and Sun.\" nights as was<br />\nlisted; Richard Taylor was not<br />\nat Chester's Place Wednesday<br />\nnight but Tommy Roberts was<br />\n(either way is great entertainment); and Maxie was not playing at the Rotunda, but Cocoon<br />\nwas.

It's not really by the<br />\nwhole Monty Python troupe,<br />\nactually, but by rrlembers Terry<br />\nJones and Michael Palin. True<br />\nPythonians will remember the<br />\nduo from the too-limited television series Ripping Yarns. Their<br />\nlatest collaboration is a took<br />\nentitled Dr. Fegg's Encyclopeadia of All World<br />\nKnowledge, which is actually a<br />\nrevised edition of their 1974<br />\nmaster work, Bert Fegg's Nasty Bookfor Boys and Girls, or<br />\nsimply The Nasty Book. If<br />\nyou've read that already, don't<br />\nbother with this one, but<br />\nchances are you haven't, so,<br />\nread on, pig-dog.<br />\nThe Encyclopeadia is just<br />\nwhat it says it is: a compilation<br />\nof information on everything<br />\nfrom alcoholic dogs to zerorated with all sorts of interesting tidbits stuck in between. The format is alphabet<br />\nical, with so-called \"advertiser's announcements\" by Dr.<br />\nFegg stuck all over the place.<br />\nFegg is a misshapen, grotesque<br />\n0411W0<br />\n<br />\nlooking man, is a child<br />\nmolester, does unmentionable<br />\nthings to sheep, and is an allaround nice guy. References to<br />\nFegg grow a bit tiresome<br />\nsometimes, but there is enough<br />\nother material to compensate.<br />\nWhen anything new connected with Python comes out,<br />\nthe first question to ask always<br />\nis: Is it something completely<br />\ndifferent? Yes and no. Yes, it's<br />\nnew material, with some rehash<br />\nfrom Ripping Yarns, such as<br />\nAcross the Andes by Frog, and<br />\nthe Parlor Games of Spoons<br />\nand Pass the Bengal Tiger. No,<br />\nit's not the same in that the style<br />\nof humor is absolutely absurd,<br />\nthings that are so ridiculous<br />\nthat they're funny. The Encyclopeadia follows this tradition, while not as grandiosely as<br />\nFlying Circus did, but it still<br />\nworks.<br />\nAs with other lastest-in-theseries type works, you'll like it<br />\nif you liked the others. If you<br />\nenjoyed Holy Grail, Life of<br />\nBrian, and the rest, you will be<br />\namused. Otherwise, you will<br />\nfind the book incredibly stupid,<br />\nmoronic, asinine, and maybe<br />\neven offensive. It is very sexist,<br />\nof course not maliciously, so<br />\nthe sexism also turns out funny, as does the racism, the<br />\nreligious satire, and the gore.<br />\nStay away from the book if<br />\nyou're a member of the<br />\n<br />\n0.01111)41111.041111111.041\u20221111.04=10<br />\n<br />\nFeminist Alliance, JDL, Rev.<br />\nFarrakhan Fan Club, KKK,<br />\nAmerican Nazi Party, or any<br />\nother extremist closed-minded<br />\ngroup. It is these people that<br />\nPalin and Jones rag on to get<br />\nthe most of their laughs. Unfortunately reductio-ad-absurdum<br />\nhumor seems to be \"out\" now<br />\nat Hopkins (or so I'm told by<br />\nthe Black and Blue Jay, which<br />\nclaims to be under severe administrative restrictions on<br />\nmaterial), so this book probably won't get the circulation<br />\nit deserves.<br />\nOf course, the rest of us are<br />\nmade fun of too, but a Python<br />\nfan is usually marked by his<br />\ngood humor and ability to take<br />\nsome ribbing. Palin and Jones<br />\nseem to come out and say that<br />\nwe're all pretty pathetic people<br />\nliving in a pathetic world, and<br />\nso we all deserve to be laughed<br />\nat. And those who don't<br />\nunderstand that are the ones<br />\nwho deserve it the most.<br />\nIn any case, the book is funny. At least to myself and my<br />\nroommates. And as always, if<br />\nyou don't agree with us, you<br />\nlose big. Buy the book, it only<br />\ncosts $7.99, or steal it for free.<br />\nYou'll like it, or you'll be a<br />\ntasteless snob.

Eli Kabillio punted a<br />\n36-yard field goal through the<br />\nuprights with 20 seconds remaining to knotch the win.<br />\nWith a fourth and two from<br />\nthe 20 yard line, Pfiefer was<br />\nfaced with a decision that<br />\nwould determine a winner from<br />\na loser. Pfiefer and defensive<br />\ncoordinator Bob Babb stood<br />\nfacing each other, weighing the<br />\noptions.<br />\nOnly 26 seconds remained at<br />\nthe point of decision. Go for<br />\nthe first down with McLam<br />\nrunning off tackle or send out<br />\nKabillio for the kick. Well,<br />\nMcLam has run well and the<br />\noffensive line is opening roadways for holes. But if McLam<br />\nfalls short, the opportunity to<br />\nwin the game would never<br />\nOCCUr.<br />\n<br />\n\"We had time to get it closer<br />\nbut I knew we were in Eli's<br />\nrange,\" said Pfiefer. \"We<br />\ndecided to go for the winner.\"<br />\nBingo; circle gets the square;<br />\nand a Hopkins victory.<br />\nAs well as a thriller, this was<br />\na game of firsts. It was the first<br />\ntime the offense moved the ball<br />\nconsistently; it was the first<br />\ntime an opponent was able to<br />\nthrow consistently; and it was<br />\nthe first time the offense bailed<br />\nout the defense for a win.<br />\n\"The defense, I think, was<br />\npsyched that the offense came<br />\nthrough,\" said Ritchie Schell.<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshatt<br />\n<br />\nthan redeemed the<br />\nEli Kabillio strides into his game winning kick last Saturday. The climactic boot more<br />\nattempts.<br />\nsophomore for two earlier missed<br />\n<br />\n\"We were down after giving up<br />\nthat touchdown but the offense<br />\nresponded.\"<br />\nUrsinus put points on the<br />\nscoreboard on its opening<br />\ndrive. A ten play march climaxed in a two yard run by Joe<br />\nSawyers for a 7-0 lead. The<br />\ntouchdown was aided by a<br />\n38-yard pass completion that<br />\nput the ball on the two yard<br />\nline. The pass was a tight end<br />\ndrag across the middle which<br />\n<br />\nhaunted the Jays defense the<br />\nentire game. \u2022<br />\nHopkins moved the ball in<br />\nthe first half with some consistency, but the squad couldn't<br />\nbreak into the end zone. Two<br />\ndrives ended disastrously with<br />\na field goal. At the half,<br />\nHopkins still trailed 7-0.<br />\nThe Jays took the second<br />\nhalf kickoff and drove 73 yards<br />\nfor a score. Mark Campbell hit<br />\ntight end Joe Sokolowski on a<br />\n<br />\n21-yard pass to tie the score.<br />\nThe drive consumed seven<br />\nminutes with 12 plays, 9 of<br />\nwhich were rushing. This uncharacteristic play calling from<br />\nthe pass-oriented Pfiefer was<br />\ndue to good offensive line play.<br />\nAfter sputtering thus far this<br />\nseason, the 0 line put together<br />\na solid effort which ultimately<br />\nwas the key to the victory.<br />\nThe Jays began another drive<br />\nwhich started on their own nine<br />\n<br />\nyard line. As the third quarter<br />\nended, Hopkins was at midfield. An interference call on a<br />\npass to Chris Verica put the ball<br />\non the Ursinus 27 yard line.<br />\nCampbell then scrambled out<br />\nof the pocket and hit McLam<br />\nwith a pass at the 15 yard line.<br />\nThree plays later, Campbell<br />\nthrew a perfect pass to Tom<br />\nFinegan for a touchdown. On<br />\nthe extra point kick by Tom<br />\nLoftus, the Jays committed a<br />\ncostly penalty. The penalty, a<br />\nfive-yarder for too many men<br />\non the line of scrimmage, made<br />\nLoftus kick the point again.<br />\nAfter his first kick split the<br />\nuprights, his second kick was<br />\nwide but the Jays still led 13-7.<br />\nUrsinus put together a drive<br />\nthat traveled down inside the<br />\nHopkins ten yard line. But on<br />\na fourth and three from the<br />\nseven, Jim Ryan put pressure<br />\non the quarterback and his pass<br />\nfell incomplete. But it wasn't<br />\nover.<br />\nThe Bears got the ball back<br />\nwith less than three minutes to<br />\ngo in the game. On a third and<br />\nseven, Ursinus used the tight<br />\nend drag once again to gain 39<br />\nyards and moved the ball to the<br />\nHopkins 31. On the next play,<br />\nUrsinus went deep into the right<br />\ncorner for a touchdown. Ursinus' Jay Mullin got a step on<br />\ncornerback Jim Cardwell and<br />\nUrsinus' Brian McCloskey<br />\nthrew a perfect pass for a score.<br />\nTrailing 14-13, Mark Campbell took over the game.

Ma,<br />\nWashington won 4 of 6 singles<br />\nmatches, then took two of thre.<br />\ndoubles to nail down the<br />\nvictory.<br />\nTwo freshmen, Chris Emmick and Huong Pham provided the two Hopkins wins.

There were some<br />\nbright spots, though.

Since it<br />\nis the first Fall Break, it will<br />\nperhaps not be \"a real measure<br />\nof what Fall Break can be,\"<br />\nsaid Savitz. Because the<br />\nacademic calendar was only approved during the summer, the<br />\ncommittee formed to plan the<br />\nFall Break events only began<br />\nworking six weeks ago.<br />\nThe activities planned in<br />\nthese six weeks indicate a<br />\nserious attempt to provide<br />\nstudents with a much needed<br />\nrest from the pressure at<br />\nHopkins, according to cochairman Mark Goodman. He<br />\nsaid that Fall Break \"should be<br />\na blast with things going on all<br />\nweekend.\" Because of a more<br />\nlimited budget, the scale of Fall<br />\nBreak is not as grand as that of<br />\nSpring Fair.

In the 80's, however,<br />\nthe U.S. is thinking of arms<br />\ncontrol as a snare and an illusion, since it only leads to a<br />\nweakening of the U.S.'s position.

Students receive a<br /><br />\ntotal of five academic credits<br />\nfor their work in the program.<br />\nBoth the state and local internships begin in January with<br />\nan orientation program designed to introduce students to the<br />\nlegislative body to which they<br />\nhave been assigned. Several<br />\nlegislators speak on such basics<br />\nas committee structure, how a<br />\nbill is drafted and becomes law,<br />\nand the relationship between<br />\nthe legislative and executive<br />\nbranches.<br />\nBeginning in the second semester, students are assigned<br />\nreadings on state and local<br />\ngovernment that are designed<br />\nto complement their work experiences. The readings vary<br />\nfrom traditional political theory<br />\nto analyses of contemporary<br />\npolitics. The readings explore<br />\nsuch topics as the nature of the<br />\nurban machine, the role of<br />\ncommunity groups in government, and legislative reform.<br />\nApplications for the Curriculum for Political Leadership<br />\nare available in Room D-1 of<br />\nthe Metro Center(basement of<br />\nShriver).

It does not<br />\nprovide for optimism, however,<br />\nsince the US has said it will<br />\nnever put SDI on the bargaining sheet.\"<br />\nChuvankhin then revealed<br />\nwhat the Soviets thought of the<br />\nSDI program, calling it a \"new<br />\nclass of offensive strike weapons.\" He added,\"No one can<br />\nsay that such a space weapon<br />\ncould not hit missiles still on the<br /><br />\nstealth and cruise missiles are<br />\nall clearly first-strike weapons<br />\nthat the US keeps building that<br />\ndemonstrate that the US is not<br />\nwilling to comply with our proposed 50% cut in missile<br />\nproduction.<br />\nFurthermore, by devising<br />\nspace-strike weapons, the US is<br />\ndestroying the arms control<br />\nagreement of the ABM treaty<br />\nthat has held peace for 50 years.<br />\nThe transition period to spacestrike weapons will be tricky, to<br /><br />\ndescribing the Soviet desire for<br />\npeace, saying, \"Since August 6,<br />\nall nuclear test explosions have<br />\nceased in the USSR.

The<br />\nnext agreement that was made<br />\nwas entitled SALT which dealt<br />\nwith offensive nuclear weapons. It attempted to slow down<br />\nand channel arms productions<br />\nto less dangerous weapons.<br />\n\"Neither SALT agreement is<br />\ntechnically enforced,\" stated<br />\nTalbott,\"SALT I expired eight<br />\nyears ago and SALT II was<br />\nnever ratified by the US<br />\nCongress.\"<br />\nTalbott then spoke of more<br />\ncurrent developments, saying,<br />\n\"Although President Reagan<br />\ncampaigned against SALT II,<br />\nhis objections had little to do<br />\nwith the treaty. Instead his<br />\ncampaigning was the result of<br />\nSoviet intervention in Afghanistan and the lack of confidnece<br />\nin Carter. The attempts to<br />\nreplace the SALT treaties have<br />\nhad very poor results.<br />\n\"In 1983, during talks for a<br />\nnew treaty called START,\"<br />\nadded Talbott, \"the Soviets<br />\nstaged a walkout.

That issue<br />\nwas brought to the fore last year by the<br />\ncreation of the HOP, which was designed to coordinate all social programming<br />\non campus. Since the HOP's birth, programming by the classes has declined<br />\nsharply.<br />\nThat has caused some members of the<br />\nCouncil to argue that the classes require<br />\nless money than they used to. That, in<br />\nturn, has caused almost all of the class<br />\nofficers to worry that their budgets might<br />\nbe slashed. The current move to review<br />\nfunding, for example, came from Senior<br />\nClass Representative Alison Little, a<br />\nlong-time defender of the classes'<br />\nposition.<br />\nLittle argues that classes sponsor fewer<br />\nsocial events than they used to because,<br />\nsince they can't sell beer, they can't make<br />\nmoney. Three or four years ago, she<br /><br />\nsays, class parties at least broke even,<br />\nallowing the classes to sponsor a lot of<br />\nevents and still have an adequate kitty<br />\nfor graduation.<br />\nWhy the Council made such an aboutface isn't exactly clear. The public reason<br />\nis that the original charge of the committee was too vague. A little specification<br />\ncould obviously have been added, but instead the Council decided to ask the<br />\nHOP and the SAC to review their own<br />\nfunding procedures and report to the<br />\nCouncil if they find any problems. That<br />\nis absurdly naive. Those are the two<br />\norganizations which the classes claim are<br />\nthe problem. (That point caused Little<br />\nto say what is undoubtedly the Quote of<br />\nthe Year:\"To tell the SAC and the HOP<br />\nto examine themselves is also vague, not<br />\nto mention extremely kinky.\")<br />\nWe're not exactly sure the committee<br />\ncreated two weeks ago was the right vehicle to examine funding. (It was to be<br />\nchaired by Little, for example; a more<br />\nimpartial Council member would be a<br />\nbetter choice.) But the fact is that the<br />\nclasses have a point\u2014funding in the<br />\nHOP era needs to be reexamined.<br /><br />\nIs College Boring?<br />\nIn an extraordinary moment of candor for the American educational<br />\nestablishment, a recent report on<br />\nundergraduate education in this country<br />\nnotes that often college \"is boring, particularly the classroom part.\" We at<br />\nHopkins ought to take that to heart.<br />\nThe report was issued by the Carnegie<br />\nFoundation for the Advancement of<br />\nTeaching, and was written by Frank<br />\nNewman, president of the Education<br />\nCommission of the States. It discusses a<br />\nbroad range of issues facing American<br />\nhigher education\u2014everything from<br />\nfinancial aid to improving scientific<br />\nresearch. But the report's most interesting section\u2014and, at least from a<br />\nHopkins standpoint, its most relevant\u2014<br />\ndeals with ways to develop an educational system which will engender more<br />\ncreativity and civic involvement among<br />\nstudents. Students around here are<br />\nrenowned for lacking both.<br />\nNewman points out that the lack of<br />\ncreativity displayed by many of today's<br />\nstudents is the fault of the university:<br />\n\"Students too frequently sit passively in<br />\nclass, take safe courses, are discouraged<br />\nfrom risky or interdisciplinary research<br />\nprojects, and are discouraged from<br />\nchallenging the ideas presented to them.\"<br />\nSimilarly, universities have no one but<br />\nthemselves to blame for the obvious(and<br />\nmuch discussed) lack of civic interest<br />\nshown by their students. Newman points<br />\nout that instilling a greater sense of civic<br />\nresponsibility in students requires that<br />\nuniversities accept a role far broader than<br />\nthe mere mastery of knowledge\u2014they<br />\nmust inculcate values. \"For the first two<br />\ncenturies of American higher education,<br />\nthe development of the character of the<br /><br />\nstudent was seen as the central task of<br />\nthe administration and faculty. For the<br />\nlast half century, it has declined in priority....there is little evidence to indicate<br />\nthat colleges and universities are interested, let alone effective, in encouraging value development.\"<br />\nSo what is the solution? How can<br />\nuniversities cause their students to<br />\nbecome both more creative and less<br />\napathetic about civic concerns? The<br />\nreport offers an answer: \"The student<br />\nmust become more actively involved in<br />\nhis or her own learning. Far too often,<br />\nstudents are treated as the object of learning rather than as colleagues in the learning process.\" To accomplish that, the<br />\nreport suggests several specific remedies,<br />\nincluding expanded internships and national service opportunities.<br />\nWhile we think a full solution would<br />\nrequire somewhat more radical action,<br />\nNewman's recommendations are worth<br />\nlooking at, particularly for Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br />\nWhat other university is so brilliant an<br />\nexample of the problems he illustrates?<br />\nWe have a faculty that is uninterested (at<br />\ntimes it seems almost disinterested) in<br />\nteaching, and students who not only lack<br />\ncreativity (except perhaps in ways to<br />\ncompete)and utterly unconcerned about<br />\ncivic issues. Most undergrads here do<br />\nnothing more than learn chemical equations by rote and can barely tell you<br />\nwho's Secretary of State.<br />\nThe Newman report doesn't represent<br />\na complete solution to the problems<br />\nplaguing American higher education, but<br />\nit is at least a recognition that they exist. That's a good sign, particularly for<br />\na school like Hopkins.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI attended the WJHU general<br />\nmeeting on Wednesday, October 2, at which David Creagh<br />\nspoke. The article in last week's<br />\nNews-Letter raised some points<br />\nthat should be clarified.<br />\nIt is true that there will be<br />\nthree part-time positions<br />\ntargeted towards students.<br />\nHowever, these positions do<br />\nnot involve producing programs on the air. These positions are an engineering assistant, a record librarian, and an<br />\nadministrative liaison (an \"ambassador to certain departments<br />\nof the University.\").<br />\nAccording to this article,<br />\nCreagh feels that his policy of<br />\ndisregarding whether applicants<br />\nare students will not hurt the<br />\nstudents' position, as \"many<br />\nstudents and community people<br />\nwho I have heard were extremely impressive.\"<br />\nNevertheless, professional<br />\napplicants have a significant advantage over others applying<br />\nfor positions at the radio station. By their very nature, professional practices such as<br />\n\"horizontal continuity\" (i.e.<br />\none person occupies the same<br />\ntime slot all week), which<br />\nCreagh brought up at the<br />\nmeeting, discriminate against<br />\nstudents. Working at a<br />\nprofessionally-managed radio<br />\nstation is a full-time job. How<br />\nmany students can afford to<br />\nspend four hours a day, five<br />\ndays a week at a station?<br />\nIn short, the days of the<br />\nstudent-run WJHU are over. In<br />\nits place will be a new 25,000<br />\nwatt station, of perhaps national significance. We can on-<br /><br />\nly hope for some room for<br />\nstudents at such a station.<br />\nThe administration of this<br />\nuniversity should re-examine its<br />\npriorities. What is the purpose<br />\nof WJHU, if not to provide<br />\nstudents and other community<br />\nmembers with the opportunity<br />\nto operate and manage the<br />\noutstanding radio station that<br />\nBaltimore magazine voted<br />\n\"Baltimore's Best\"?

The author<br />\nrejects affirmative action programs that would equalize the<br />\nratio between male and female<br />\nemployees in comparable jobs,<br />\nin the interest of \"treating both<br />\nsexes equally.\"<br />\nWhat Chen does not seem to<br />\nrealize is that without a program committed to achieving<br />\nparity of the sexes in employment, this institution, like all<br />\nmale-dominated systems, will<br /><br />\ncontinue to view women as inadequate and sub-standard. As<br />\nChen states, academia has been<br />\ntraditionally labelled a male<br />\nsystem, and only a few extraordinary women \"have been able<br />\nto transcend this gap.\" But<br />\nnow, according to the author,<br />\nsince universities have opened<br />\ntheir doors to women, \"the<br />\nnumber of females represented<br />\nin both faculty and student<br />\npopulation will increase on its<br />\nown.\" This type of thinking is<br />\nan outrage. It is similar to the<br />\nvirulently racist notion expressed by the dominant group in<br />\nsociety regarding the oppressed<br />\ngroups in which the dominant<br />\ngroup rejects any favoritism<br />\ntowards the oppressed group in<br />\nhiring, public assistance, health<br />\ncare, etc. The feeling stated by<br />\nthe dominant is \"I made it on<br />\nmy own without any help from<br />\nanyone, why can't he (or in this<br />\ncase, she)?<br />\nThe answer is that the oppressed group has many factors<br />\nstacked against it that stand in<br />\nthe way of achieving success,<br />\nthat is, achieving equality with<br />\nthe dominant group. In the case<br />\nof women, it is the paternalistic<br />\nvalues of society that prevent<br />\nwomen from acquiring tenured<br />\npositions and policy-making<br />\njobs in male-dominated<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nGiven this obstruction, why<br />\nshouldn't there be affirmative<br />\naction policies at this university? I find Joe Chen's argument<br />\nthat an affirmative action<br />\npolicy would favor one side<br />\n(women) over another side<br />\n(men) to be a sexist tactic<br />\nthat does not consider the extenuating circumstances surrounding such a policy. As he<br />\nstates himself, a few extraordinary women have managed to<br />\ntranscend the gap. And that's<br />\nwhat a woman must be if she is<br /><br />\nto succeed in a male<br />\ninstitution\u2014out of the ordinary. She has to prove herself<br />\nto be better than all the men<br />\ncompeting for the same job.<br />\nChen apparently sees nothing<br />\nwrong with this. I certainly do.<br />\nAnd if society refuses to change<br />\nits paternalistic values in favor<br />\nof more humanitarian ones,<br />\nand if the only way to alleviate<br />\nunfair hiring practices is affirmative action, I support it.<br /><br />\nLetter Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editor.

The average<br />\nage in my class is 27. \"She has<br />\na baby with her.\" \"His son just<br />\ngraduated from Ohio State!\"<br />\nBut enough said, for after all,<br />\nS.A.I.S. is a graduate school<br />\nand such things must be<br />\nexpected.<br />\nAs one of three A.B.-M.A.<br />\nstudents beginning at S.A.I.S.<br />\nthis year, I am discovering the<br />\njoys and agonies of a graduate<br />\ninstitution. There are less than<br />\n100 students in their first year,<br />\nout of over 1200 applicants,<br />\nand they truly represent an extraordinary gamut of personalities, cultures, and<br />\nbackgrounds. My classmates<br />\nsixty<br />\nover<br />\nrepresent<br />\nundergraduate institutions.<br />\n65% have spent time outside of<br />\nthe States, and their average<br />\nGPA from college is 3.5. One<br />\ncannot escape the feeling that<br />\nthe person in the next desk<br />\n'could probably explain more<br />\nabout the political structure of<br />\nNepal than the consul himself.<br />\nSo why exactly does one stray<br />\nfrom Homewood to that<br />\npolitical city 37 miles<br />\nsouthwest?<br />\nA great incentive is<br />\nWashington itself. Where else<br />\nto pursue international relations and have a wealth of<br />\nnightlife on hand at the same<br />\ntime?<br />\nall<br />\nYou<br />\nknow<br />\nGeorgetown, but there are<br />\nplaces other than St Elmo's'<br />\nwhich burn with excitement.<br />\nLest I forget, education is the<br />\nessential reason for attending<br />\nS.A.I.S.<br />\nNot all people here know<br />\nwhat they want to do after their<br />\ntwo years, and many are still<br />\ndeciding on their areas of concentration. Moreover, not all<br />\nare equally adept in the subject<br />\nareas offered. For instance, an<br />\noverwhelming majority of the<br />\nentering class was advised to<br />\ntake \"Basic Math for Social<br />\nSciences.\" With perhaps that<br />\none exception, images of eighth<br /><br />\nCourtesy of News and Information<br /><br />\nGreg Pease<br /><br />\ngrade are quite remote. Course<br />\nsize varies a lot. My French<br />\nclass has four people, while<br />\nTrade Theory overflows into<br />\nthe hallway. Perhaps the<br />\ngreatest difference from<br />\nHomewood is that all classes<br />\nmeet once a week for two<br />\nhours, except for languages,<br />\nwhich meet for a minimum of<br />\n5 hours/ week at all levels. At<br />\nthis point in one's education,<br />\nthere is no shame about how<br />\nmuch reading is doled out.<br />\nWhatever happened to those<br />\nnice \"little\" assignments I<br />\nknew so well?<br />\n\"Grad\" students at S.A.I.S.<br />\ndo not resemble the folks you<br />\nremember from the sixties<br />\nbefore they underwent the \"Big<br />\nChill,\" but rather tend to take<br />\non the appearance of \"St.<br /><br />\nElmo's\" graduates after the<br />\nfire. Men show up in everything<br />\nfrom gray suits and wingtips to<br />\nEurowear or Levis. Women<br />\ntend to dress with ample flair,<br />\nand show no signs of the<br />\nfamiliar freshman fifteen,<br />\nperhaps because they have had<br />\na few years without dorm type<br />\nchow. It is definitely refreshing<br />\nand enjoyable to look elsewhere<br />\nthan just the blackboard when<br />\nin a lecture.<br />\nS.A.I.S. seems to be a nine to<br />\nfive type place, and looks like<br />\nan office building, which can be<br />\na little difficult to adjust to<br />\nafter 24 hour campus life.<br />\nClasses meet at 8:30 am and<br />\nthen again from 3 pm onward.<br />\nThe time in between is reserved for mandatory language<br />\ncourses which are very tedious.<br /><br />\nImagine having French both<br />\nbefore and after lunch in the<br />\nsame day.<br />\nMany professors share some<br />\nof the same habits as those at<br />\nHomewood (unable to advise<br />\nyou, rather self-devoted). Yet<br />\nthey break the mold of typical<br />\naloofness because they provide<br />\nunique insights about their experiences and friends (I have a<br />\nprofessor who is a good friend<br />\nof Japan's Prime Minister<br />\nNakasone). The advantages of<br />\na S.A.I.S. education make one<br />\nfeel just a bit less guilty about<br />\nspending the equivalent of a<br />\nSaab each year.<br />\nSome parting words are in<br />\norder if you plan to come here.<br />\nAvoid the mandatory lunch<br />\ncafeteria tickets if at all possible (claim culture shock). Don't<br /><br />\nlet the croissants and pita bread<br />\nsandwiches fool you (and it's<br />\nnot even ARA!). I also must<br />\nmention that most people here<br />\nknow the word \"party.\" On<br />\nFridays at 5 you can find a majority of students unwinding at<br />\nthe school's customary happy<br />\nhour with their Heinekens and<br />\nBud Lights. These happy hours<br />\ntend to extend throughout the<br />\nweekend.<br />\nS.A.I.S. is nice, but then I<br />\nsay this with only a few weeks<br />\nfrom which to judge. Yet impressions are convincing.<br />\nThat's all for now from D.C.<br />\nuntil I provide details on D.C.'s<br />\ncosmopolitan nightlife which<br />\nyou too can partake in. (Yes,<br />\nthe age for most places is 18.<br />\nPut the free shuttle to S.A.I.S.<br />\nto good use.)<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/15<br /><br />\nCrossword<br />\n2<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\n31<br /><br />\n32<br /><br />\n56<br /><br />\n57<br /><br />\nby Ron DeMatte\u00b0<br />\n16<br /><br />\n15<br /><br />\n14<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\nACROSS<br />\n1.<br />\n4.<br />\n9.<br />\n13.<br />\n15.<br />\n16.<br />\n17.<br />\n20.<br />\n21.<br />\n22.<br />\n23.<br />\n25.<br />\n29.<br />\n33.<br />\n34.<br />\n35.<br /><br />\n36.<br />\n41.<br />\n42.<br />\n43.<br />\n44.<br />\n46.<br />\n49.<br />\n50.<br />\n51.<br />\n53.<br />\n58.<br />\n61.<br />\n62.<br />\n63.<br />\n64.<br />\n65.<br />\n66.<br /><br />\nBrooks, for one<br />\nPatty Duke follower<br />\nA humor<br />\nSmall case<br />\nWouk's mutiny<br />\nSale saying<br />\nWhere it's every man for<br />\nhimself<br />\nUniform motions<br />\nLBJ, once<br />\nExplosive<br />\nLadder, in Liverpool<br />\nWinners<br />\nVoltaire, for Arouet<br />\nHair style<br />\nLand unit<br />\nScale notes<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\n25<br /><br />\n20<br /><br />\n24<br /><br />\n25<br /><br />\n29<br /><br />\n28<br /><br />\n43<br /><br />\n42<br /><br />\n47<br /><br />\n3i<br /><br />\n32<br /><br />\n51<br /><br />\n52<br /><br />\n53<br /><br />\n44<br /><br />\n46<br /><br />\n45<br /><br />\n54<br /><br />\n3i<br />\n.<br />\n3<br /><br />\n41<br /><br />\n39<br /><br />\n48<br /><br />\n50<br /><br />\n49<br /><br />\n55<br /><br />\n57<br /><br />\n56<br /><br />\n58<br /><br />\n61<br /><br />\n61<br /><br />\n62<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n30<br /><br />\n29<br /><br />\n28<br /><br />\n35<br /><br />\n34<br /><br />\n37<br /><br />\n41<br /><br />\n42<br /><br />\n44<br /><br />\n51<br /><br />\n40<br /><br />\n39<br /><br />\n38<br /><br />\n36<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n45<br /><br />\n46<br /><br />\n49<br /><br />\n50<br /><br />\n47<br /><br />\n43<br /><br />\n48<br /><br />\n54<br /><br />\n53<br /><br />\n52<br /><br />\n58<br /><br />\n59<br /><br />\n61<br /><br />\n62<br /><br />\n63<br /><br />\n64<br /><br />\n65<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\n55<br /><br />\n60<br /><br />\nDOWN<br />\n19.

The<br />\nbasics are as follows:<br />\nClassical: 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.<br />\nweekdays<br />\nProgressive Rock: 9 p.m. to<br />\n6 a.m. weeknights (except<br />\nThursday, and Fridays 1 a.m. to<br />\n6 a.m.) and Saturdays from 2<br />\np.m. to 8:30 p.m.<br />\nJazz: 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.<br />\nweekdays and all day and night<br />\non Sunday<br />\nNot Available Radio<br />\n(N.A.R.\u2014a step beyond rock,<br />\njazz, and/or classical): 9 p.m.<br />\nto 6 a.m. Thursday, 1 a.m. to<br />\n6 a.m. Friday night, and 8:30<br />\np.m. to 6 a.m. Saturday nights.<br />\nSo there you have it...<br />\nUnfortunately, the remaining<br />\ntime slots are not as easy to<br />\nclear up. From after the 5:30<br />\nNews until 9 p.m., for example,<br />\nthere seems to be a general<br />\nmish-mash\u2014from reggae to<br />\nnews programs to 60's music to<br />\nart discussion shows. Well,<br />\nbelieve it or not, there is a<br />\nsystem here, too. 6-7 p.m.<br />\nweekdays is the time set apart<br />\nfor \"Educational Programming\"\u2014consisting of weekly<br />\neducational shows or public affairs programs. 7-9 p.m.<br />\nweeknights and 6 a.m. to 2<br />\np.m. on Saturday is set aside<br />\nfor \"special programming\"\u2014<br />\ni.e., types of music that have no<br />\nother outlets on WJHU,or the<br />\narea, for that matter. The<br />\nfollowing list is thus a guide to<br />\nweekly and bi-weekly programs<br />\non WJHU. Hopefully this will<br />\nstraighten out matters a bit.<br /><br />\nAmerican music and musicians,<br />\nwhether it is Clifton Chenier,<br />\nKing of Zydeco, or Charlie<br />\nParker, King of the Saxophone.<br />\nTUESDAY 7-9 p.m.<br />\nThe Long Note: A show<br />\nhosted by Bob Rickert, Frank<br />\nClaudy and friends featuring<br />\nthe best in new and old Irish (or<br />\nCeltic) music.

On<br />\n1982's Lexicon ofLove, he was<br />\na suave Bryan Ferry clone,<br />\nfrom the world-weary view of<br />\nromance propagated in his<br />\nclever lyrics, down to the wedge<br />\nof his haircut. Lexicon was<br />\na smash, spawning hit singles in<br />\n\"Look of Love\" and \"Poison<br />\nArrow\"; the formula of<br />\nromance gone wrong set to<br />\nlavish instrumentation and a<br />\ndance beat seemed so obviously right for ABC that their second LP, Beauty Stab, remains<br />\nan outright mystery.<br />\nOn this album, Fry ditched<br />\nhis second-generation Roxy<br />\nMusic roots and tried to<br />\nbecome an AOR hero. Instead<br />\nof synths and strings, Beauty<br />\nStab was best characterized by<br />\nthe ripping guitar intro to<br />\nDangerous<br />\nA<br />\n\"Love's<br />\nLanguage\" and the dark<br />\ncynicism of the words to<br />\n\"United Kingdom\" and \"Unzip.\" The LP confused ABC<br />\nfans from the Lexicon days,<br />\nand was bought by few of<br />\nthem.<br />\nABC laid low in 1984, but<br />\nnow they've reemerged as\u2014<br />\ncartoon characters? Maybe the<br />\nanimated LP cover and videos<br />\nare to let us know that they've<br />\nlightened up and brightened<br />\ntheir sound. You can definitely dance to How To Be A<br />\nZillionaire! It's as if Beauty<br />\nStab had never occurred.<br />\nGuitars are extremely scarce on<br />\nZillionaire; ABC is back to<br />\nFairlights and other high<br />\ntechnology instruments.<br /><br />\nIt was a wise decision.<br />\nAlthough I was one of about<br />\nten people in the world who actually liked Beauty Stab<br />\nonce I got over the shock, I<br />\ndecided the songs were really<br />\npretty good\u2014ABC seems born<br />\nto do numbers like \"Be Near<br />\nMe.\" Let others handle guitarladen rock; dance-pop doesn't<br />\nget much better than this.<br />\nIronically, \"Be Near Me\"<br />\nwas written back in the Lexicon<br />\ndays, and is certainly their best<br />\nshot at a hit single. It seems<br />\nradio-perfect\u2014it doesn't have<br />\nthe heavy funk bottom of the<br />\nother Zillionaire songs. Instead,<br />\nit bounces lightly along, Fry's<br />\nplaintive vocal punctuated by<br />\npizzicatoed strings and an oftrepeated keyboard riff.<br />\nIf \"Be Near Me\" does break<br />\nthrough commercially, it will be<br />\ninteresting to see what an ABC<br />\ntour would look like. Only two<br />\noriginal members remain, Fry<br />\nand synthesist Mark White; the<br />\nother half of ABC, a platinum<br />\nblonde name Eden and a bald<br />\nmidget from Texas, seemingly<br />\nadd nothing to the band except<br />\ntheir videogenicity. They don't<br />\neven do backing vocals,<br />\nalthough Eden does contribute<br />\none unforgettable line to the<br />\nbeatbox workout \"A to Z.\"<br />\nMaybe they can learn to play<br />\ntamborines before they play<br />\nlive, so they can at least appear<br />\nuseful.<br />\nA fair number of guest musicians, including ex-Squeeze<br />\nman Don Snow, add to the<br />\nsonic brew. Horns and cello<br />\nhighlight the swinging \"15<br />\nStorey Halo,\" and female<br />\nbackup vocals are prominent<br />\nis-Vo.<br /><br />\nboitbdei\u2018<br />\n'<br />\n,-0.0\u2022111%.\u2022tiP4r\"4001101111.\"<br />\n\u2022110eWN...<br />\n604its,<br /><br />\non several tracks, including \"So<br />\nHip It Hurts.\" This song seemingly borrows a bubbling percussion effect from Isaac<br />\nHayes' old \"Shaft\" theme, and<br />\nthere are plenty of soulful<br />\n\"yeah's from the backup<br />\nsingers. The lyrics are also<br />\nnostalgic in nature\u2014\"Do you<br />\nremember when men wore<br />\nskirts?...Afro wigs on albino<br />\nsquares, solar powered electric<br />\nchairs...\"<br />\nUnfortunately, the album<br />\nversion of \"Vanity Kills\" seems<br />\nsadly truncated after the terrific<br />\nextended mix (available on import 12\"). The same goes for<br />\n\"Be Near Me,\" which was at its<br />\nbest in the longer \"Munich<br />\nDisco Mix\" (another import<br />\n12\"). These dance-club<br />\nfavorites are too good to last<br />\nonly three and a half minutes.<br />\nThe other quibble I have with<br />\nthis album is that \"Fear of the<br />\nWorld,\" the opener, is weak,<br />\nresorting to copping a melodic<br />\nline from Depeche Mode's<br />\n\"People are People.\" It's interesting to note that the track's<br />\n\"guitar solo\" was actually<br />\ncourtesy of a Fairlight synthesizer, though.<br />\nStill, there's plenty of music<br />\non Zillionaire that pleases\u2014a<br />\ncouple of lovely midtempo<br />\ntunes, \"Ocean Blue\" and \"Between You and Me\"; the rollicking \"15 Storey Halo\" and the<br />\nharder groove of \"Tower of<br />\nLondon,\" to name a few examples. ABC may now be<br />\nanimated (if this LP is a real<br />\nsmash, will they get their own<br />\nSaturday morning cartoon<br />\nshow?), but Zillionaire is<br />\nserious fun.<br />\n4\u00f6#,,4,0*.4<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/17<br />\nI screwed up.<br />\nWell I certainly messed up last<br />\nweek; I can't even blame midterms for my state of absentmindedness...so without further ado\u2014the corrections to<br />\nlast week's Arts Calendar (not<br />\nthat it makes a hell of a difference now):<br />\nThe Weekend Wonder Flix<br />\nand Senior Class Film Series are<br />\nFriday and Saturday nights and<br />\nalways will be, and are not on<br />\n\"Sat. and Sun.\" nights as was<br />\nlisted; Richard Taylor was not<br />\nat Chester's Place Wednesday<br />\nnight but Tommy Roberts was<br />\n(either way is great entertainment); and Maxie was not playing at the Rotunda, but Cocoon<br />\nwas.

Having atoned for my<br />\nsins, let us turn to more pressing matters.<br />\nI need your help.

It's not really by the<br />\nwhole Monty Python troupe,<br />\nactually, but by rrlembers Terry<br />\nJones and Michael Palin. True<br />\nPythonians will remember the<br />\nduo from the too-limited television series Ripping Yarns. Their<br />\nlatest collaboration is a took<br />\nentitled Dr. Fegg's Encyclopeadia of All World<br />\nKnowledge, which is actually a<br />\nrevised edition of their 1974<br />\nmaster work, Bert Fegg's Nasty Bookfor Boys and Girls, or<br />\nsimply The Nasty Book. If<br />\nyou've read that already, don't<br />\nbother with this one, but<br />\nchances are you haven't, so,<br />\nread on, pig-dog.<br />\nThe Encyclopeadia is just<br />\nwhat it says it is: a compilation<br />\nof information on everything<br />\nfrom alcoholic dogs to zerorated with all sorts of interesting tidbits stuck in between. The format is alphabet<br />\nical, with so-called \"advertiser's announcements\" by Dr.<br />\nFegg stuck all over the place.<br />\nFegg is a misshapen, grotesque<br />\n0411W0<br /><br />\nlooking man, is a child<br />\nmolester, does unmentionable<br />\nthings to sheep, and is an allaround nice guy. References to<br />\nFegg grow a bit tiresome<br />\nsometimes, but there is enough<br />\nother material to compensate.<br />\nWhen anything new connected with Python comes out,<br />\nthe first question to ask always<br />\nis: Is it something completely<br />\ndifferent? Yes and no. Yes, it's<br />\nnew material, with some rehash<br />\nfrom Ripping Yarns, such as<br />\nAcross the Andes by Frog, and<br />\nthe Parlor Games of Spoons<br />\nand Pass the Bengal Tiger. No,<br />\nit's not the same in that the style<br />\nof humor is absolutely absurd,<br />\nthings that are so ridiculous<br />\nthat they're funny. The Encyclopeadia follows this tradition, while not as grandiosely as<br />\nFlying Circus did, but it still<br />\nworks.<br />\nAs with other lastest-in-theseries type works, you'll like it<br />\nif you liked the others. If you<br />\nenjoyed Holy Grail, Life of<br />\nBrian, and the rest, you will be<br />\namused. Otherwise, you will<br />\nfind the book incredibly stupid,<br />\nmoronic, asinine, and maybe<br />\neven offensive. It is very sexist,<br />\nof course not maliciously, so<br />\nthe sexism also turns out funny, as does the racism, the<br />\nreligious satire, and the gore.<br />\nStay away from the book if<br />\nyou're a member of the<br /><br />\n0.01111)41111.041111111.041\u20221111.04=10<br /><br />\nFeminist Alliance, JDL, Rev.<br />\nFarrakhan Fan Club, KKK,<br />\nAmerican Nazi Party, or any<br />\nother extremist closed-minded<br />\ngroup. It is these people that<br />\nPalin and Jones rag on to get<br />\nthe most of their laughs. Unfortunately reductio-ad-absurdum<br />\nhumor seems to be \"out\" now<br />\nat Hopkins (or so I'm told by<br />\nthe Black and Blue Jay, which<br />\nclaims to be under severe administrative restrictions on<br />\nmaterial), so this book probably won't get the circulation<br />\nit deserves.<br />\nOf course, the rest of us are<br />\nmade fun of too, but a Python<br />\nfan is usually marked by his<br />\ngood humor and ability to take<br />\nsome ribbing. Palin and Jones<br />\nseem to come out and say that<br />\nwe're all pretty pathetic people<br />\nliving in a pathetic world, and<br />\nso we all deserve to be laughed<br />\nat. And those who don't<br />\nunderstand that are the ones<br />\nwho deserve it the most.<br />\nIn any case, the book is funny. At least to myself and my<br />\nroommates. And as always, if<br />\nyou don't agree with us, you<br />\nlose big. Buy the book, it only<br />\ncosts $7.99, or steal it for free.<br />\nYou'll like it, or you'll be a<br />\ntasteless snob.

Eli Kabillio punted a<br />\n36-yard field goal through the<br />\nuprights with 20 seconds remaining to knotch the win.<br />\nWith a fourth and two from<br />\nthe 20 yard line, Pfiefer was<br />\nfaced with a decision that<br />\nwould determine a winner from<br />\na loser. Pfiefer and defensive<br />\ncoordinator Bob Babb stood<br />\nfacing each other, weighing the<br />\noptions.<br />\nOnly 26 seconds remained at<br />\nthe point of decision. Go for<br />\nthe first down with McLam<br />\nrunning off tackle or send out<br />\nKabillio for the kick. Well,<br />\nMcLam has run well and the<br />\noffensive line is opening roadways for holes. But if McLam<br />\nfalls short, the opportunity to<br />\nwin the game would never<br />\nOCCUr.<br /><br />\n\"We had time to get it closer<br />\nbut I knew we were in Eli's<br />\nrange,\" said Pfiefer. \"We<br />\ndecided to go for the winner.\"<br />\nBingo; circle gets the square;<br />\nand a Hopkins victory.<br />\nAs well as a thriller, this was<br />\na game of firsts. It was the first<br />\ntime the offense moved the ball<br />\nconsistently; it was the first<br />\ntime an opponent was able to<br />\nthrow consistently; and it was<br />\nthe first time the offense bailed<br />\nout the defense for a win.<br />\n\"The defense, I think, was<br />\npsyched that the offense came<br />\nthrough,\" said Ritchie Schell.<br /><br />\nJess Bunshatt<br /><br />\nthan redeemed the<br />\nEli Kabillio strides into his game winning kick last Saturday. The climactic boot more<br />\nattempts.<br />\nsophomore for two earlier missed<br /><br />\n\"We were down after giving up<br />\nthat touchdown but the offense<br />\nresponded.\"<br />\nUrsinus put points on the<br />\nscoreboard on its opening<br />\ndrive. A ten play march climaxed in a two yard run by Joe<br />\nSawyers for a 7-0 lead. The<br />\ntouchdown was aided by a<br />\n38-yard pass completion that<br />\nput the ball on the two yard<br />\nline. The pass was a tight end<br />\ndrag across the middle which<br /><br />\nhaunted the Jays defense the<br />\nentire game. \u2022<br />\nHopkins moved the ball in<br />\nthe first half with some consistency, but the squad couldn't<br />\nbreak into the end zone. Two<br />\ndrives ended disastrously with<br />\na field goal. At the half,<br />\nHopkins still trailed 7-0.<br />\nThe Jays took the second<br />\nhalf kickoff and drove 73 yards<br />\nfor a score. Mark Campbell hit<br />\ntight end Joe Sokolowski on a<br /><br />\n21-yard pass to tie the score.<br />\nThe drive consumed seven<br />\nminutes with 12 plays, 9 of<br />\nwhich were rushing. This uncharacteristic play calling from<br />\nthe pass-oriented Pfiefer was<br />\ndue to good offensive line play.<br />\nAfter sputtering thus far this<br />\nseason, the 0 line put together<br />\na solid effort which ultimately<br />\nwas the key to the victory.<br />\nThe Jays began another drive<br />\nwhich started on their own nine<br /><br />\nyard line. As the third quarter<br />\nended, Hopkins was at midfield. An interference call on a<br />\npass to Chris Verica put the ball<br />\non the Ursinus 27 yard line.<br />\nCampbell then scrambled out<br />\nof the pocket and hit McLam<br />\nwith a pass at the 15 yard line.<br />\nThree plays later, Campbell<br />\nthrew a perfect pass to Tom<br />\nFinegan for a touchdown. On<br />\nthe extra point kick by Tom<br />\nLoftus, the Jays committed a<br />\ncostly penalty. The penalty, a<br />\nfive-yarder for too many men<br />\non the line of scrimmage, made<br />\nLoftus kick the point again.<br />\nAfter his first kick split the<br />\nuprights, his second kick was<br />\nwide but the Jays still led 13-7.<br />\nUrsinus put together a drive<br />\nthat traveled down inside the<br />\nHopkins ten yard line. But on<br />\na fourth and three from the<br />\nseven, Jim Ryan put pressure<br />\non the quarterback and his pass<br />\nfell incomplete. But it wasn't<br />\nover.<br />\nThe Bears got the ball back<br />\nwith less than three minutes to<br />\ngo in the game. On a third and<br />\nseven, Ursinus used the tight<br />\nend drag once again to gain 39<br />\nyards and moved the ball to the<br />\nHopkins 31. On the next play,<br />\nUrsinus went deep into the right<br />\ncorner for a touchdown. Ursinus' Jay Mullin got a step on<br />\ncornerback Jim Cardwell and<br />\nUrsinus' Brian McCloskey<br />\nthrew a perfect pass for a score.<br />\nTrailing 14-13, Mark Campbell took over the game.

Ma,<br />\nWashington won 4 of 6 singles<br />\nmatches, then took two of thre.<br />\ndoubles to nail down the<br />\nvictory.<br />\nTwo freshmen, Chris Emmick and Huong Pham provided the two Hopkins wins.
