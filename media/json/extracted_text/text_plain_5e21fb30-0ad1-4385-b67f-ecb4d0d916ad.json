He said that<br />\nan officer from the Baltimore<br />\nPolice and a member of Hopkins<br />\nSecurity would be present.<br />\nThe next step, according to<br />\nSlenker, would be to divide the<br />\nCharles Village area into one to<br />\ntwo block segments, which<br />\nfraternities would canvass, in an<br />\nattempt to get full community<br />\nparticipation.<br />\nUnder the neighborhood watch<br />\n<br />\nprogram, Slenker said, if \"twothirds of the residents on la] block<br />\n...join the program...the city will<br />\nmount Neighborhood Watch<br />\nsigns.\" He noted that \u2014 those<br />\nblocks participating in the<br />\nNeighborhood Watch program<br />\nexperienced a fifty percent reduction in the crime rate.\"<br />\nDirector of Student Activities<br />\nBill Smedick said that the IFC<br />\n\"should take [the proposal]<br />\nseriously.\" According to<br />\nSmedick, the program is an opportunity for greeks to \"show<br />\nleadership on campus and in the<br />\ncommunity.\" He also said that he<br />\nsupported the proposal brought<br />\nby Slenker and Yoon.<br />\nSlenker said that he hoped to<br />\nexpand the program in the future<br />\nto include other neighborhoods.<br />\n\"If this proves to be successful,\"<br />\nthe proposal states,' and if the<br />\nsituation in the Remington,<br />\nGuilford, and Canterbury areas<br />\ndeteriorates, it will be recommended that the watch sign ups<br />\nexpand to those areas.\"<br />\nAccording to the proposal, \"of<br />\nthe entire Charles Village area,<br />\nonly six blocks currently parcity's<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\nticipate<br />\nNeighborhood Watch program.\"<br />\nThe proposal states as its aims<br />\na \"heighten[ed] awareness,<br />\ndiminish[ed] insecurities on the<br />\npart of the caller, and ...[a reduced] number of crimes committed<br />\nin the given area.\"<br />\nSlenker and Yoon described<br />\nstudent life as being \"highly transient.\"Controlling crime in<br />\nsuch an environment requires a<br />\nhigher degree of public awareness<br />\nand participation [in] the enforcement of law,\" according to their<br />\nproposal.<br />\nIn their proposal to the IFC,<br />\nSlenker and Yoon described<br />\n\"lengthy discussions with<br />\nCharles Village residents,<br />\nleaders, and Commander Dan<br />\nCaulk and Sergeant Tom Bull of<br />\nthe Northern District Police<br />\nDepartment.\" It was these<br />\ndiscussions, they stated, which<br />\nled to their efforts to initiate a<br />\nNeighborhood Watch program<br />\ninvolving students.<br />\n<br />\nCommunity Crime Report<br />\n\u2022Armed Robbery Unit blk.

Drawing support<br />\nfrom the Departments of English,<br />\nHumanities, and Writing<br />\nSeminars, the society will bring<br />\ntogether students in each of these<br />\ndisciplines for the study of<br />\nliterature to counterbalance the<br />\ndivision among the three areas.<br />\nNetworking the departments,<br />\nSechriest said, will provide a<br />\ncommon ground for fostering<br />\nliterary consciousness and exposure on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\norganizers,<br />\nFounding<br />\nSechriest, Cortwright McMeel,<br />\nChristine Zhubrod, and Adam<br />\nToll exhibit this unity as<br />\nrepresentatives of the three<br />\ndepartmental majors. The group<br />\nhas been working for two years<br />\nto establish the society.<br />\nThe Sidney Lanier Literary<br />\nSociety honors its namesake,<br />\nSechriest said, by holding the<br />\nman's ideas as its own, namely<br />\nbringing literature back to<br />\n<br />\nHopkins and reintroducing the<br />\nstudent population to the enjoyment of literary scholarship.<br />\nSechriest said that the organization sprung from a desire not only<br />\nto unite the closely related<br />\ndisciplines, but to fully express<br />\nthe diversity of the undergraduate<br />\npopulation here at Hopkins. As<br />\nSechriest stated at the first<br />\nmeeting, \"We [Hopkins] don't<br />\nreflect the diversity that is really<br />\nhere. We have the diversity; we<br />\njust don't show it.\"<br />\nMcMeel said that \"at Hopkins,<br />\nthings stay latent,\" referring to<br />\nthe underacknowledgement of the<br />\nhumanities and non-scientific<br />\nstudies. He pointed out that at<br />\nother prestigious universities<br />\nthere are several societies of<br />\nliterature on each campus<br />\nwhereas Hopkins only has one<br />\ngraduate literary society, the<br />\nTudor and Stuart Club.<br />\nthat<br />\nsaid<br />\nMcMeel<br />\nundergraduate societies for<br />\nstudents in science and engineering exist, promoting the appearance of a non-diverse student<br />\nbody.<br />\nThe primary goal of the society is to facilitate a lecture<br />\nseries, according to Sechriest. Initially tapping into the Hopkins<br />\nfaculty, the society, Sechriest<br />\nsaid, hopes to broaden the<br />\nbreadth of its speakers to include<br />\ncircuit lecturers and presentators,<br />\nwell-renowned in their literary<br />\nfield. These plans, Sechriest said,<br />\nmight include the appearance of<br />\n<br />\nRickey Denounces Racism and<br />\nThe David Duke Phenomenon<br />\n<br />\nPlans<br />\nFor<br />\nMcCoy<br />\nProposed<br />\n<br />\nby Stephanie Sneddon<br />\n<br />\nContinued from page 2<br />\n\"food court concept,\" which will<br />\nbe open until 2 or 3 a.m. Students<br />\nliving in these buildings will be<br />\nrequired to buy a meal plan, as<br />\nthe kitchenettes in the rooms are<br />\n\"not very practical,\" said Community Assistant Rich Quarles.<br />\nQuarles said that since the meal<br />\nplan is so expensive, the<br />\nsophomore year will become<br />\nmuch more costly. Miller said,<br />\nhowever, that \"Cost is always a<br />\nconsideration. We are very competitively priced in relation to the<br />\nrest of the community.\"<br />\nBoswell said that the cost of the<br />\nsophomore and freshman years<br />\nunder the plan would be roughly<br />\nequal.<br />\nThe concept of housemasters<br />\nand community assistants will<br />\nalso change. \"We will find a<br />\ncommon name for housemasters<br />\nand community assistants. But<br />\nthere will be a resident assistant<br />\nfor 40 residents. They will of<br />\ncourse do different things for<br />\nfreshmen and sophomores,\"<br />\nBoswell said.<br />\nRoommates will still be assigned for freshmen, but sophomores<br />\nwill be allowed to choose.<br />\nBoswell said she envisions that<br />\ngroups of ten friends will choose<br />\nto share a unit.<br />\nBuilding security was also considered.

In addition,<br />\nresidents will have individual<br />\nkeys to their rooms.<br />\nMiller said the housemasters<br />\nand community assistants who<br />\nsaw the proposed floor plans<br />\nwere \"very positive about it.\"<br />\nShe said, \"Students will have an<br />\nincreased opportunity to remain<br />\npart of the campus after freshman<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nBoswell added, \"A lot of<br />\nfreshmen would enjoy not having<br />\nto worry about where to live after<br />\ntheir first year. After sophomore<br />\nyear, students are more comfortable, and are more used to<br />\nthings. This would alleviate many<br />\nof these concerns.\"<br />\nQuarles said:\"I agree that it<br />\nwill create a sense of community, but I disagree with the way<br />\nthey're going about it. 1 think the<br />\nUniversity can fill McCoy<br />\nhousing<br />\nmaking<br />\nwitLout<br />\nmandatory.\"<br />\n<br />\nLoren Rieth<br />\n<br />\nFranklin Sechriest is one of the organizers of the Sidney Lanier Literary<br />\nSociety.<br />\na Sidney Lanier impersonator Sechriest and McMeel pointed<br />\nreading some of Lanier's work to out that by merely attending the<br />\ninaugurate the first lecture series meeting, students were already<br />\nof the Sidney Lanier Literary exhibiting Lanier-like qualities.<br />\n\"Lanier was quite a stoic [in<br />\nSociety.<br />\nNamed for the first professor terms of learning] and devoted to<br />\nof English at Hopkins, the society Johns Hopkins,\" said Sechriest.<br />\nmulti-talented Armed with Lanier's inspiration<br />\nhonors<br />\na<br />\nRenaissance man.

Race<br />\nmixing causes all problems.<br />\nUltimately segregation is the<br />\nideal, but it is difficult to do in<br />\nthe U.S.\"<br />\n<br />\nRickey described Duke as a<br />\nstrange extremist, who in addition<br />\nto running anti-semetic, pro-Nazi<br />\nliterature out of his State<br />\nLegislature's office, has, according to Rickey, written a sex<br />\nmanual for women and has had<br />\nextensive facial reconstruction.<br />\n\"A lot about Duke is very<br />\nbizarre,\" she said.<br />\nIn 1989, Rickey said she attended a closed meeting for the<br />\nNational American Socialist Party members where Duke encouraged others to run for<br />\nRepublican offices, saying,<br />\n\u2014That's where our people are.\"<br />\n\"David Duke was using the<br />\nRepublican Party for his own personal agenda,\" Rickey stated.<br />\nRickey spoke of her profound<br />\ndisillusion with the Republican<br />\nParty in Louisiana. Their failure<br />\nto confront Duke's alterior<br />\nmotives, Rickey said, prompted<br />\nher to form the Louisiana Coalition, a group dedicated to informing people about Duke and candidates like him.<br />\nRickey describes Duke's<br />\npolitics as a national threat.<br />\nEighty-two percent of Duke's<br />\nfunding comes from outside of<br />\nLouisiana, she said.

One unique aspect of<br />\nthe program, Walkowitz explained, is the cross-listing of<br />\ncourses, through which other<br />\ndepartments can offer courses<br />\nthat relate their respective areas<br />\nto Women's Studies or gender<br />\nissues. These course are considered to be included within that<br />\ndepartment and the Women's<br />\nStudies program simultaneously.<br />\nOver the course of a year, the<br />\nnumber of courses cross-listed<br />\nwith the Women's Studies program has risen from three to<br />\ntwenty, and is still growing. One<br />\nthird of these focus specifically on<br />\ngender issues.<br />\nWalkowitz will soon propose a<br />\nminor in Women's Studies, to be<br />\nconsidered by Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences Lloyd Armstrong. The<br />\nminor will offer students already<br />\npursuing a rigorous interdisciplinary study of gender<br />\nissues to receive formal recognition for their work.<br />\nAdditionally, the minor may<br />\nhelp to attract students to Hopkins<br />\nwho are interested in studying<br />\n<br />\nthese issues, and will give<br />\nWomen's Studies at Hopkins<br />\ngreater visibility in the academic<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe expansion of the program<br />\nreceived a great boost,<br />\nWalkowitz said, with a four-year<br />\n$150,000 grant from the Ford<br />\nFoundation.<br />\nSome of this money has gone<br />\nto fund a series of faculty<br />\nseminars, which help to promote<br />\nawareness of women's issues<br />\namong faculty from different<br />\ndisciplines by offering ideas about<br />\nways to incorporate aspects of<br />\ngender relations into their respective fields.<br />\nOf the twelve professors now<br />\ninvolved in the seminar program,<br />\nhalf are established scholars in<br />\nWomen's Studies, while others<br />\nare from fields such as International Relations, Environmental<br />\nEngineering, English, and<br />\nAnthropology.<br />\nWalkowitz called the consistent<br />\nand diverse attendance at the<br />\nseminars \"an exciting and gratifying experience.\" She observed that the program had<br />\nstimulated faculty to teach<br />\n<br />\ncourses related to Women's<br />\nStudies or to change the focus of<br />\ntheir courses to incorporate issues<br />\nof gender relations.<br />\nThe money from the Ford<br />\nFoundation will also go toward<br />\nencouraging undergraduates to<br />\nengage in independent research<br />\non \"topics related to women or<br />\ngender,\" either for credit or as<br />\npart of a senior thesis. Five<br />\nfellowships are available, each<br />\ncarrying a $2000 stipend for the<br />\nstudent and $800 for the advisor.<br />\nThe Ford grant also provides<br />\nfor a new lecture series begun this<br />\nyear, said Walkowitz. Most of<br />\nthe speakers will address topics,<br />\nconjoined with undergraduate<br />\ncourses cross-listed in Women's<br />\nStudies.<br />\nShe explained that one of the<br />\npurposes of the series is to expose<br />\nundergraduates to the professional academic community and<br />\nto encourage them to pursue<br />\nacademic interests beyond their<br />\nclasses. The lectures also allow<br />\nfor greater interaction between<br />\nundergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudents. In the past, most lee-<br />\n<br />\ntures offered have been geared<br />\ntoward graduate students only.<br />\nSaid Julie Hardwick, a<br />\ngraduate student in the Department of History who is focusing<br />\nher study on gender issues,<br />\n\"There was a lot of interest in<br />\nwomen's studies before this, and<br />\nthe program has helped to create<br />\na sense of community among<br />\nwomen [with an interest in<br />\nwomen's studies].\"<br />\nThere will also be a series of<br />\nfilms and speakers concerning<br />\nvarious aspects of women's issues<br />\nfor women's history month next<br />\nsemester, said Hardwick, who<br />\nwill be running the program. She<br />\nexpressed her hope that the series<br />\nwill help to draw in interested<br />\nundergraduates as well as<br />\ngraduate students.<br />\nWalkowitz is confident that<br />\nwhen the grant money runs out<br />\nthere will be enough interest<br />\ngenerated for the University to<br />\ncontinue to hind the aspects of the<br />\nprogram previously provided for<br />\nb) the Ford grant.<br />\n<br />\nsend those people to Congress.<br />\nDavid M.

I<br />\nfinally got sick enough of doing<br />\nmy Abnormal Psychology paper<br />\nover Thanksgiving vacation that<br />\nI figured I'd write to you. Hmm.<br />\nThat isn't much of a segue now,<br />\nis it?<br />\nI'm actually getting along<br />\nsomewhat well in my academics<br />\nhere, although this is currently<br />\nweek three of my advisor's apparent abduction. I'm beginning<br />\nto believe that \"office hours\" are<br />\nlisted so that you'd know what<br />\ntime the office would be there,<br />\nnot the advisor.<br />\nNot only that, but the registrar<br />\nhas absolutely no record of my<br />\ninter-term courses. After seeing<br />\nthem about it, they told me that<br />\nI had to check with the Department of Academic Advising. The<br />\nDepartment told me that I had to<br />\nfind the teacher and get her<br />\nsignature and bring it back here.<br />\nWell, when I found the teacher,<br />\nshe told me that the registrar had<br />\nlost all the grades and that there<br />\nwas a specific form that I had to<br />\nsign and return to Academic Advising. Upon returning to that<br />\ndepartment, they informed me<br />\nthat the forms were down at the<br />\nregistrar. I got the form and<br />\nreturned to my professor's<br />\ndepartment, but apparently her<br />\noffice hour was up, and she had<br />\nleft for vacation.<br />\nThis is what you're missing not<br />\ngoing to school.<br />\nSince Carol lives around here,<br />\nI'm up at her house for<br />\nThanksgiving. It's a whole lot<br />\ncheaper than heading out there for<br />\nthree days, but I still wish I could.<br />\nBesides, Carol's family, while<br />\nwonderfully nice, are stranger<br />\nthan Zack. Well, almost.<br />\nSpeaking of the Zackster, he<br />\nfinally showed me those comics<br />\nthat you said you were going to<br />\nsend. After realizing that he had<br />\nspent about the last week in our<br />\napartment, he remembered thlo<br />\nhe hadn't done his dishes before<br />\ncoming over to visit, so he ran<br />\n<br />\nback to his place to clean up<br />\nbefore the break. I swear, it was<br />\nthe first moment of silence that<br />\nI've had since he came over. He's<br />\ngreat, but he really needs to get<br />\nhis own life. I think he's getting<br />\nover Carol somewhat, though,<br />\nand hopefully that will give him<br />\nthe kick in the rear that he needs.<br />\nWe had a hell of a time getting<br />\nup here. Tell me if this sounds<br />\nfamiliar. Carol's parents had<br />\ntickets for us to see a Broadway<br />\nplay, so we were going to go<br />\nstraight to New York, meet them<br />\nat the restaurant, and then go for<br />\nthe play. We got to the train station about two minutes after the<br />\ntrain we wanted. So Carol went<br />\nup and asked how much more<br />\n<br />\nIn which Miranda<br />\ngets in touch with<br />\nDavid\u2014sort of<br />\ntickets were for the Metroliner<br />\n(the next train getting in).<br />\nThe guy gave a price which<br />\nwas more than the two of us had,<br />\nso I said we could use my money<br />\nmachine card to go get what we<br />\nneeded. Catch: they had closed<br />\nthe machine in the the station, so<br />\nwe had to run two and a half<br />\nblocks to the next closest one,<br />\nwhere we got stuck in line behind<br />\nsomeone slower than your<br />\nmother.<br />\nWe finally got the money and<br />\nran back to the station. Luckily,<br />\nthe train hadn't gotten in yet.<br />\nUnluckily, when Carol went to<br />\nget tickets, the guy said that the<br />\ntrain was txx)ked. Not that he told<br />\nus this when we asked about it or<br />\nanything. So we got the regular<br />\npriced tickets for the next train,<br />\nwhich hopefully would get us<br />\nthere with about a half-hour to<br />\neat. Carol called and told her<br />\nparents to order for us and when<br />\nwe would be there.<br />\nWell, the train got in about ten<br />\nContinued on page 17<br />\n<br />\nThis week the Tau Epsilon Phi fraternity went before<br />\nthe Inter-Fraternity Council Grievance Board for charges<br />\nof four violations of IFC rules. Three of the charges were<br />\ndropped, but TEP pled guilty to the fourth charge\u2014verbal<br />\nsexual harrassment. In the course of an already complicated<br />\nseries of events, a member of the fraternity spoke to a<br />\nwoman from the community in a way that the woman felt<br />\nconstituted sexual harrassment. The woman lodged a written complaint with the University, initiating an IFC investigation into the incident.<br />\nThe circumstances under which the infraction occurred<br />\nwere unusual. Still, regardless of location or situation,<br />\nfraternity brothers, like everyone else, have an obligation<br />\nto conduct themselves appropriately. As members of a<br />\nfraternity that operates with the sanction of the University, the TEP brothers had a further obligation to represent<br />\ntheir fraternity in a respectable manner and to comply with<br />\nIFC rules. The TEP brothers apparently recognize that the<br />\nincident was inappropriate and a violation\u2014they pled guilty<br />\nto the charge, cooperated with the investigation, and took<br />\nimmediate steps within the fraternity to penalize the brother<br />\nwho committed the offense.<br />\nThe real issue, then, is the ruling handed down by the<br />\nIFC Grievance Board. The fraternity was given a penalty<br />\nwhich some feel is both unduly harsh under the circumstances and inconsistent with past IFC rulings. TEP<br />\nbrothers claim that they have been treated unfairly. After<br />\nall, flagrant violations of IFC rules occur regularly without<br />\ncoming under the scrutiny of the Grievance Board or the<br />\nUniversity administration.<br />\nThe IFC ruling, though out of character, is not unfair.<br />\nThe prevalence of sexual harrassment incidents involving<br />\nfraternity members indicates that stricter attention and har-<br />\n<br />\nsher penalties are called for\u2014in fact, they were called for<br />\nlong ago. It may be that the IFC is truly concerned about<br />\ncurrent violations within the fraternities and is sending a<br />\nmessage that they will no longer be tolerated. It can justify<br />\nits action by addressing these insidious human climate problems regularly and with an even hand.<br />\nHowever, important questions remain regarding the ruling. For starters: why now? What aspect of this particular<br />\nincident prompted the harsh response from the Board?<br />\nThough any action taken to improve the human climate<br />\nat Hopkins is commendable, it is not clear that addressing<br />\nclimate problems on behalf of the students was indeed the<br />\nagenda of the Grievance Board.<br />\nThis event is marked by the presence of a community<br />\nmember not associated with the University. Lately, administrative offices here at Homewood have been bombarded with complaints from the community concerning<br />\nstudents. It seems that the relationship between students<br />\nand the rest of the community, delicate and tenuous under<br />\nthe best of circumstances, has recently become outright<br />\nhostile in many instances. There are many indications that<br />\nstudents in general are being unfairly and unreasonably<br />\ntargeted as destructive members of the community, and<br />\nare not given credit for their positive contributions to the<br />\narea.<br />\nAny steps toward improving the social environment and<br />\nquality of life here at Hopkins are worthy of support. But<br />\nit would certainly be unfortunate if, after years of internal criticism and much student energy devoted to these<br />\nissues, without comparable administrative action, Hopkins<br />\nresponded to unreasonable and unjustified pressure from<br />\noutside the University under the guise of addressing the<br />\n\"needs of the students.\"<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nRobert Rastelli: In Memoriam; TEP States Its Case<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nRobert Rastelli passed away<br />\nrecently. Many of you saw that funny, bouncy walk of his. Some of you<br />\nmay even have listened to his odd<br />\nmonotone voice at one time or<br />\nanother. Most of you never got a<br />\nchance to meet him because he was<br />\nso introverted, one of thousands of<br />\nfaceless people who drift in and out<br />\nof our lives every day. To me he<br />\nwasn't. There was so much to him<br />\nthat was so genuinely good, I can't<br />\njust let him slip quietly by without<br />\nan introduction. It's the least I could<br />\ndo. He was my friend.<br />\nI met Robert during fall registration 1989; my roommate and I sat on<br />\nthe fire escape pondering uses for the<br />\nspare bedroom in our apartment.<br />\nRobert popped his head out the window and introduced himslef, \"Hi,<br />\nI'm Rob Rastelli. I'm 21. I'm your<br />\nnew roommate.\" Without waiting<br />\nfor an answer, he popped his head<br />\nback in the window and disappeared<br />\nfor the next three months. When he<br />\nturned up I learned the depth of his<br />\ncharacter beneath the odd veneer.<br />\nHe was kind. About a month ago<br />\nhe wrote me describing a talk he'd<br />\nhad with a beggar by Greenmount<br />\nAvenue. Part of his letter read,<br />\n\"You, being who you are, probably<br />\nwonder why I stood and listened to<br />\nthis guy?\" I smiled, remembering<br />\nmany such stories where he astonished me with his naivete, and I him<br />\nwith my cynicism. He continued, \"I<br />\ndon't mind listening to their performances if they don't touch me and<br />\nI'm not in a hurry. I figure anyone<br />\nwho's so willing to suck up to white<br />\nasshole college students must really<br />\nneed the money. \"Listen,\" the beggar said, \"I've been fired. Can you<br />\nspare a few bucks? I've got to get my<br />\ndaughter some meat.\" Robert pulled a chicken pot pie from his shopping bag. The beggar hemmed and<br />\nhawed about how, no, she needed<br />\nmeat. Robert replied, \"It's got meat<br />\nin it. She'll like it.\" The conversation was ended.<br />\nRobert made me laugh. He could<br />\nbe almost like a cartoon character,<br />\na real loon. Last summer we went<br />\nskeet shooting a few times, passing<br />\ngrazing cows each time during the<br />\nride to Elk Neck state park. Once he<br />\npointed to one of them saying,<br />\n\"Let's plug that cow and tie it to the<br />\nhood of the VW. We'll mount the<br />\nhead as a trophy.\" Sportsmen that<br />\nwe were. Sometimes last year we'd<br />\nstay up watching TV into the night,<br />\nwell past the hour when Steven L.<br />\nMiles became ubiquitous. If we were<br />\nsober, we'd be half-crazed by the<br />\ntedium and laughing at something<br />\nthat probably wasn't at all funny.<br />\nOne of us would say, \"You know<br />\nmy smile hides a deep dark sorrow,\"<br />\nand then we'd toss our heads back<br />\nlaughing, each of us dead certain the<br />\nother was too airheaded to remotely<br />\nunderstand sorrow. We were both<br />\nwrong.<br />\n1 could write on well beyond the<br />\nlimits of your patience, but I won't;<br />\n<br />\nanyway, it's only fair that most of<br />\nthe memories remain my own. It<br />\npoured the day Robert was buried;<br />\neven the trees cried. It was so difficult to find solace in anything, not<br />\neven in his peaceful rest. Peace<br />\nalways seemed the furthest<br />\nthing from his mind; he was<br />\nlife<br />\nof<br />\nfull<br />\nso<br />\nalways<br />\nand had so much to give: These<br />\nmemories sustain me in my grief. I<br />\nwish I could close with something<br />\ncomforting, but such thoughts escape<br />\nme. I hope that all of us who knew<br />\nand loved him, family and friends<br />\nmight somehow find peace with<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nSteve Sirotic<br />\nClass of 1990<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn behalf of Tau Epsilon Phi, we<br />\nare writing to give the true version<br />\nof what has led us to be put on social<br />\nprobation. A neighbor of ours Ms.<br />\nKathleen Guzda sent a letter to the<br />\nschool which caused us to go in front<br />\nof the grievance board. Her account<br />\nis largely false and we would like to<br />\nsay what actually happened.<br />\nOn Oct. 10, Gary Chinn was fired<br />\nas the cook of Tau Epsilon Phi. That<br />\nevening he returned to the house to<br />\nsupposedly pick up some medication<br />\nwhich he had left behind. He was obviously intoxicated and talked with<br />\nthe brothers for quite some time<br />\nbefore slipping up the stairs unnoticed. A few minutes later one of our<br />\nbrothers saw him leave the premises<br />\nwith something hidden under his<br />\njacket and walk quickly up to<br />\nCanterbury St.<br />\nSuspecting that something may<br />\nhave been taken, he asked everyone<br />\nto check their valuables and upon doing so we discovered that Kevin<br />\nQuinn's tape deck was missing. At<br />\nthat point six of our brothers drove<br />\ndown the street to find him. At the<br />\ncorner of Canterbury and 39th we<br />\nsaw him walking with the tape deck.<br />\nOne of our brothers went to call<br />\nthe police while the rest of us got out<br />\nof the car and approached Mr.<br />\nChinn. Mr. Chinn then threw the<br />\ntape deck to the ground and tried to<br />\npush past us. We asked him to wait<br />\nfor the police to come. He took a<br />\n<br />\nswing at two brothers, one of which<br />\npushed Mr. Chinn to the ground<br />\nwhere he was held until the police<br />\narrived. He was then taken into<br />\ncustody by the police.<br />\nAt that time, we were asked if we<br />\nwished to file assault and/or theft<br />\ncharges against Mr. Chinn. Kevin<br />\nQuinn did file theft charges for<br />\nwhich Mr. Chinn was convicted. Of<br />\nficer Willis, the arresting officer,<br />\nwith whom we spoke as recently as<br />\nthis weekend, commended us for our<br />\nbehavior and gave us his number so<br />\nthat anyone who wishes to speak to<br />\nhim concerning the matter can do so.<br />\nThe real problems occured when<br />\nMs. Guzda arrived on the scene.<br />\nAfter we had been able to detain Mr.<br />\nChinn, she arrived yelling and<br />\nscreaming that a large group of upper class white boys (obviously<br />\noverlooking our black brothers)<br />\nwere beating up a poor black man<br />\nwhen in reality, not a single blow<br />\nwas struck other than the single push<br />\nit took to knock the intoxicated Mr.<br />\nChinn to the ground. She then continued to scream about us roaming<br />\nthe streets with a baseball bat.<br />\nAlthough we had grabbed a bat out<br />\nof the car for protection, no one had<br />\ncome even close to using it. Officer<br />\nWillis later stated that it was completely reasonable to bring it along<br />\nconsidering that Mr. Chinn has been<br />\narrested on numerous assault charges<br />\nwhich we were well aware of.<br />\nAt this point in time, some of our<br />\nbrothers attempted to explain the<br />\nsituation to Ms. Guzda, however she<br />\ndid nothing but continue to yell at us,<br />\nsaying such things as \"Poor babies,<br />\nyou can't live without the CD player<br />\nyour mommy and daddy pay for.\"<br />\nWith this type of abuse being<br />\nthrown our way and given the nature<br />\nof this situation, one of our brothers,<br />\nbrother X, lost his cool. He began<br />\nto shout back at this woman and<br />\nwhen she continued to insult him, he<br />\ntold her to -Get the hell out of here!<br />\nSuck my dick, lady.\" At that point<br />\nin time another brother approached<br />\nthe two of them and told brother X<br />\nto walk away, which he did.<br />\nFrom this point on, including in<br />\nthe presence of the police, she continued to harass all of our brothers,<br />\n<br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors.

We<br />\nreserve the right to limit the<br />\nnumber of letters printed in<br />\na given issue.<br />\n<br />\nas well as two other witnesses who<br />\nwere speaking in our defense, with<br />\ncomments about frat boys caring for<br />\nnothing but violence and alcohol.<br />\nThe brothers who heard brother<br />\nX's comments did not approve of<br />\nthem. This was why one of our<br />\nbrothers made a point of apologizing that same evening to Ms. Guzda. Brother X himself made an effort to apologize the next day;<br />\nhowever, he could not determine<br />\nwhere she resided.<br />\nAs a fraternity, the matter was<br />\ndiscussed in the executive board and<br />\nit was determined that brother X was<br />\nto be placed on social probation for<br />\nthe rest of the semester for being<br />\nrude to a neighbor. The matter was<br />\nfurther discussed with three<br />\nmembers of our national [fraternity<br />\nchapter] upon their receipt of Ms.<br />\nGuzda's letter of complaint. They<br />\nwere extremely pleased with the way<br />\nwe handled the situation and supported our behavior.<br />\nThat is what happened on the night<br />\nin question. At the trial on Monday<br />\n[Nov. 12], we read the allegations<br />\nwhich she wished to charge us with.<br />\nThey were largely fabricated with<br />\nnumerous embellishments. For example, Ms. Guzda mentioned in her<br />\nletter that young men were outside<br />\nher window repeating obscenities the<br />\nnext night. This is either a complete<br />\nlie or did not involve TEP. We<br />\ndidn't even know where she lived!<br />\nTEP was charged on four separate<br />\ncounts and plead not guilty to all but<br />\nthe count of verbal sexual harassment to which we plead guilty. We<br />\nwere completely cleared of all these<br />\ncharges. We fully cooperated with<br />\nthe IFC and the administration during this whole ordeal.<br />\nTEP feels that it has acted in a proper manner. The authority figure at<br />\nthe scene, Officer Willis, also stated<br />\nthat all of our actions with regards<br />\nto the stolen property were justified<br />\nand more than reasonable. Brother<br />\nX made his comment in the heat of<br />\nthe moment in a very unusual situation. He regrets it, as it was not<br />\nderived from any malice towards<br />\nMs. Guzda. As a fratenity, we truly<br />\nfeel that after this unfortunate incident we could not have dealt with<br />\nthis situation in a more responsible<br />\nand cooperative manner than we did.<br />\nUnfortunately, the IFC board<br />\nrendered a five-point decision of<br />\nwhich social probation through<br />\nMarch I is a part. TEP feels that this<br />\npunishment was caused by the executive board's desire to make an example of us and of a judicial process<br />\nwhich was tainted. They failed to<br />\nmake contact with any of our<br />\nwitnesses despite being offered their<br />\nnumbers to call and many of the<br />\ncomments which were made to the<br />\njury were in our opinion highly biased against us.<br />\nWe feel that the desire to punish<br />\nTEP far outweighed the desire to<br />\ndiscover what actually occured.<br />\nFinally, our cooperation in this mat-<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/7<br />\n<br />\nScrew the Right Thing<br />\nStephen Kent Jusick<br />\nWith President Richardson<br />\nfully installed and making waves<br />\n(or at least ripples) about the importance of undergraduate education, various tongues of the administration have adopted<br />\nrhetoric spouting similar<br />\nmessages intended only to deflect<br />\ncriticism and elevate their own<br />\nstatus.<br />\nIn many ways, administrators<br />\nare like civil servants: people who<br />\nhave a minimum level of competence and are fairly secure in<br />\ntheir jobs. When a new President<br />\narrives, the herd must adapt. To<br />\ncurry favor, or stabilize their<br />\njobs, the public statements by the<br />\nlapdogs of official policy and sentiment may change in tone,<br />\nperhaps even in direct opposition<br />\nto earlier stances. But functionally, everything remains the same.<br />\nWhat this means now is that<br />\nlip-service\u2014and only that\u2014will<br />\nbe paid to student concerns,<br />\ndespite the more promising<br />\nemanations from Garland and<br />\nMerryman.<br />\nClearly, academic needs of the<br />\npopulation must be confronted.<br />\nSuggestions for desired and needed courses (Japanese, critical<br />\ntheory, anatomy, et al.) are too<br />\nquickly rebuffed at low levels of<br />\ndiscussion. Permanent advisors<br />\nshould be in place for majors<br />\nother than Pre-Med and Pre-Law.<br />\nBut there is an exigency in the<br />\narea of support services and dayto-day life. With curriculum<br />\nchanges choked by procedural<br />\nfilibustering and grant application<br />\npaperwork, it is easier to effect<br />\n<br />\ntheir<br />\nroles as<br />\npseudohousemasters. This is a result of<br />\nthe low ratio of CAs to student<br />\ncharges, leading to an intimate<br />\nrelationship that exists only in<br />\ntheory. This year CAs were placed in the Homewood, which officially established that building<br />\nas a \"significant\" dwelling for<br />\nundergrads.<br />\nThere are other campus<br />\nresources that can help students<br />\nwho are trying to cope. The most<br />\nobvious is the understaffed White<br />\nHouse, which counsels students<br />\nfor both one-time and continuing<br />\nneuroses. For many, however,<br />\nthe thought of psychological<br />\ncounseling carries a stigma.<br />\nWhat's an off-campus student to<br />\ndo if A Place To Talk isn't open?<br />\nThere are few options. The effect of the atmosphere at Johns<br />\nHopkins is akin to ripping the<br />\nscab from an infected wound.<br />\nWith a reputation as a grind<br />\nschool without a social life, JHU<br />\ncould serve as the Platonic ideal.<br />\nIt is this very want of an outlet<br />\nfor student anxieties and frustrations that can make a normally<br />\nbearable situation intolerable, or<br />\na dilemma into a crisis of<br />\ndevastating proportions. The<br />\nstress mounts exponentially,<br />\nfeeding upon itself, exacerbating<br />\nthe situation.<br />\nThe Human Climate Task<br />\nForce Report, released in the fall<br />\nof 1987, delineated many of these<br />\ntroubles with the University's<br />\ndisposition. Tentative steps are<br />\nnow being taken toward facing<br />\nsome of them, such as the treat-<br />\n<br />\nIf not the students themselves, who<br />\nwill make a concrete commitment to<br />\nthe mammoth task of bettering Hopkins'<br />\nsense of community? More important,<br />\nhow would it be done?<br />\nchange in the way undergraduates<br />\nare treated on a human level.<br />\nMuch of the programming that<br />\naids students in a peripheral but<br />\nessential way originates in the offices of Residential Life and Student Activities. Examples are<br />\nself-defense workshops and<br />\nalcohol awareness or wellness<br />\nprograms.<br />\nFor students who live in<br />\nUniversity<br />\nhousing, the<br />\nHousemasters and Community<br />\nAssistants(CAs) should provide<br />\na certain cushion for the stressed<br />\nacademic who wants to bail out.<br />\nThese positions can also provide<br />\na bridge through the seemingly<br />\nlayers<br />\nof<br />\nlabyrinthine<br />\nbureaucracy one encounters when<br />\nasking simple questions.<br />\nIn truth, CAs have yet to fulfill<br />\n<br />\nment of women. But others have<br />\nbeen shunted into the wings to<br />\nwait for a beneficient angel to<br />\ntake up their cause.<br />\nIf not the students themselves,<br />\nwho will make a concrete commitment to the mammoth task of<br />\nbettering Hopkins's sense of<br />\ncommunity? More important,<br />\nhow would it be done? One<br />\nperennial suggestion is to give<br />\nstudents\u2014graduates as well as<br />\nundergraduates\u2014a feeling that<br />\nthey belong. And it must be<br />\nsincere. Not a facade, deceptively<br />\npromising refuge, but some genuine compassion. It cannot be<br />\nthe usual formulaic mouthings<br />\nthat have the instruction \"insert<br />\nname here.\"<br />\nHoppy Hour has been lauded<br />\nas one of the most successful stu-<br />\n<br />\ndent events ever sponsored by the<br />\nUniversity. But even regular<br />\ngoers will acknowledge that the<br />\nweekly gathering, whose apparent attraction is cheap drinks,<br />\nis not a great place to meet new<br />\npeople.<br />\nAnd what does it say about the<br />\nFaculty-Student Interaction program that a paid student staff<br />\ncreates most of the events and approaches professors to act as<br />\nhosts? Where is the enthusiasm<br />\non the part of faculty for getting<br />\nto know those whom they are<br />\nteaching so occasionally?<br />\nThe hails of McCoy, the<br />\nHomewood and the Baltimorean<br />\nare cold and foreboding. Yet<br />\nstill, many prefer to hole up in<br />\ntheir depressing bed-sits rather<br />\nthan return .to campus for a<br />\nmeeting or lecture. Roach-ridden<br />\nand depressingly dull, these cells<br />\nof solitude are preferred to the socalled amenities of the campus.<br />\nHow can one choose insulation<br />\nover relation unless the ex-<br />\n<br />\nperience is thoroughly repulsive?<br />\nWhat kind of school is it where<br />\nthe only time the class gets<br />\ntogether is at graduation?<br />\nFreshmen used to get a handshake<br />\nfrom President Muller during<br />\ntheir orientation, but the experience served to fragment<br />\nrather than unite. This year<br />\nRichardson introduced what is intended to be a new tradition: convocation. The word itself means<br />\na calling together, which is a<br />\nmove in the right direction.<br />\nAt a campus where autonomy<br />\nis so highly valued, where individual will determines so much,<br />\nwhat thought is given to a collective well-being? At times of stress<br />\nand concern, perhaps what is<br />\nneeded is not isolation and<br />\nwithdrawal, but a sheltering environment providing succor. The<br />\nUniversity does this to some extent with the programs mentioned above, but it needs to do more.<br />\nAn atmosphere that is less competitive and more concerned with<br />\n<br />\nE-Level<br />\nthe condition of the human spirit<br />\nwould be a startling transformation, but an uplifting one.<br />\nRecent events on and off campus are cause for concern. People find themselves wrestling<br />\nwith questions about the practical<br />\n<br />\nKathy Korbuly<br />\nand philosophical quandaries nagging at their psyches. They must<br />\nknow\u2014or feel\u2014that Hopkins is a<br />\nplace where they can find some<br />\nsympathy for any conundrum.<br />\nSadly, as the events of the last<br />\nfew weeks have proven, it is not.<br />\n<br />\nEgo Dico<br />\nSeveral weeks ago I noticed in<br />\nthe News-Letter that for the second year in a row Hopkins had<br />\ndropped in that almighty indicator<br />\nof academic excellence, the U.S.<br />\nNews and World Report Annual<br />\nRanking of Universities. Well, I<br />\nrealize that the Five-Year Plan is<br />\nnot doing wonderful things for<br />\nthe quality of undergraduate<br />\neducation, but are we really falling down the slippery slope<br />\ntowards mediocrity?<br />\nTo help with my search I went<br />\nto the Admissions Office; they<br />\nare the ones who present the image of Hopkins towards tomorrow's college students. I expected<br />\nto hear that Hopkins is having difficulty attracting anybody to apply here, yet just the opposite is<br />\ntrue. In fact, the last three years<br />\nhave all been record years for<br />\nnumbers of applicants. Even<br />\nmore surprising, Director of Admissions Richard Fuller told me<br />\nthis year that his office has received a record number of early decision applicants, which is as good<br />\nan indicator as any for the total<br />\nnumber of applicants that<br />\nHopkins will receive this year.<br />\nI have to admit that I left the<br />\nplace a bit puzzled. After all, if<br />\nthe general campus consensus is<br />\nthat President pre-What's-HisName built up the flashy parts of<br />\nthe university at the cost of<br />\nundergraduates, why would more<br />\npeople than ever before want to<br />\ncome here? I offer several<br />\nhypotheses. First, the hype that<br />\nthe quality of undergraduate<br />\neducation is at an all-time low is<br />\n<br />\nBradley Cohen<br />\n<br />\nsimply wrong. Arguments can be<br />\nmade for or against this claim.<br />\nSecondly, prospective students<br />\nare either not aware of the FiveYear Plan or do not feel that it<br />\nwill affect them significantly.<br />\nThis hypothesis is stronger<br />\nbecause even with the full impact<br />\nof the Five Year Plan, Hopkins<br />\nis still smaller than Harvard or<br />\nStanford.<br />\nA third possibility, and the one<br />\nthat the Admissions Office would<br />\nlike you to believe, is that<br />\nHopkins is becoming a trendy<br />\nplace\u2014 a la Duke or<br />\nGeorgetown. Somehow, I just<br />\ncannot accept this one. Since<br />\nwhen has a tremendous workload<br />\nand mounds of stress been<br />\npopular? Still, numbers do not<br />\nlie.<br />\nAt this point, try to remember<br />\nthe reasons that you applied here<br />\nin the first place. My personal<br />\nfavorite line is \"I applied to<br />\nHopkins as my safety school.\"<br />\nYeah, right. The number of people who actually applied here<br />\nbecause it was their safety school<br />\nis probably no higher than the<br />\nlargest single-digit prime number.<br />\nThe reasons that we applied<br />\nhere are the same reasons that<br />\nstudents applied here ten years<br />\nago and continue to be the same<br />\nreasons today. Small size,<br />\nacademic flexibility, and the opportunity for independent work<br />\nare the main attractions of Johns<br />\nHopkins. Today we may complain about the ills the Five-Year<br />\nplan is creating, but those<br />\nqualities which attracted us to<br />\n<br />\nHopkins in the first place still<br />\nexist.<br />\nSo, where does that leave us?<br />\nShould one feel alarmed about the<br />\nU.S. News ranking or proud that<br />\nHopkins is becoming such a<br />\npopular place? After thinking<br />\nabout it for a while, I would venture that one should feel glad<br />\nabout being here. After all, the<br />\nquality of the faculty, with the exception of the French Department, remains the same, While<br />\nthe University's facilities, if<br />\nanything, have improved.<br />\nIf you still remain unconvinced, think of this. Recently Stanford announced that it was facing<br />\na budget deficit and would also<br />\ninclude faculty layoffs. Thus, the<br />\nproblems of Hopkins are not unique:. we were just forced to deal<br />\nwith ours sooner. After years of<br />\ngo-go growth, universities, like<br />\nany other part of the economy,<br />\nare going to have to go through<br />\n<br />\nEAi<br />\n<br />\nJA<br />\n<br />\na period of downsizing.<br />\nThe ultimate effects of this<br />\nnation-wide academic downsizing<br />\nhave yet to be determined.<br />\nHopkins could emerge as a<br />\nsmaller, more well-balanced<br />\nplace or it could be more imbalanced than ever before. In<br />\nthinking about the future of<br />\nHopkins, one can only hope that<br />\naccolades that have been given to<br />\nPresident Williamson (or was it<br />\nRichardson?) are accurate. Otherwise, Hopkins may end up in the<br />\nsecond most important category<br />\nof the U.S. News rankings, the<br />\nschools that are \"Up and Comers.\"<br />\nThe News-Letter:<br />\nBringing Johns Hopkins news<br />\nto you since 1897.*<br />\n<br />\n1501ND<br />\n<br />\n3-.H.

First, I would like to address<br />\nthe letter to the editor submitted by<br />\nMr. Lisak and the brothers of ATO<br />\n[Letters, Nov. 91. Second, I would<br />\nlike to inform the Hopkins community about our intramural athletics<br />\nprogram.<br />\nLet me begin with flag football.<br />\nThe play-off schedule was posted on<br />\nThursday, 10/11/90, at the cage in<br />\nthe athletic center. At that time SAM<br />\nhad a perfect record of 3-0, and<br />\nATO was 2-0-1. Being seeded second, SAM was scheduled to play<br />\nseventh ranked DU (2-1). ATO was<br />\nseeded fourth, so they were scheduled to play fifth ranked FIJI (2-1).<br />\nATO had previously been scheduled to play SAM on 10/4/90.<br />\nHowever, the game was mutually<br />\npostponed until the following week<br />\non 10/12/90. ATO defeated SAM<br />\nand should therefore have been<br />\nscheduled to play DU in the first<br />\n<br />\nround of the play-offs seedings, but<br />\nDU defeated ATO in the second<br />\nround 13-12.<br />\nAs Mr. Lisak pointed out, the outdoor soccer tournament was run with<br />\nincompetence. There were problems<br />\ngetting people to referee the games,<br />\nand the winners in all of the<br />\ninbrackets\u2014dormitories,<br />\ndependents, and fraternities\u2014were<br />\nscheduled to play consecutive<br />\ngames. After trying to piece together<br />\nthe weekend's results, the Board is<br />\ncurrently rerunning the tournament.<br />\nOnly the fraternity results were left<br />\nuntouched. Giving the past year's<br />\nchampions byes, if such a need<br />\narises, is a commendable suggestion;<br />\nhowever, none of the results from<br />\nlast year were kept, and it is difficult<br />\nto determine how the teams placed.<br />\nThe suggestion was used in the<br />\nlacrosse tournament this weekend.<br />\nAt this point. I would like to<br />\napologize for the actions of the<br />\nBoard member at the soccer tournament. He acted inappropriately, and<br />\nhe was reprimanded accordingly that<br />\nweekend. If a team fails to show a<br />\nfull squad within 10 minutes of the<br />\nscheduled event, then that team<br />\nautomatically forfeits that event.<br />\nSince it is a BIA by-law, there is no<br />\nneed to protest. If there are any further questions about these by-laws,<br />\nplease call me at 338-8788 or stop<br />\nby Sylvester 106.<br />\n<br />\nFrom what I have been able to<br />\ngather about the indoor soccer, there<br />\nwere four teams with records which<br />\nmade them eligible for the play-offs:<br />\nSigEp (2-1), DU (2-1), ATO (3-0),<br />\nand PhiPsi (1-1). DU should have<br />\nplayed SigEp and ATO should have<br />\nplayed PhiPsi. ATO schould have<br />\ncontacted Dominick Wiker concerning the actual pairings. If there are<br />\nany problems, you must contact the<br />\nBoard member running the sport. If<br />\nyou are not satisfied with his/her<br />\nresponse, then you can contact me.<br />\nThe Board has a responsibility to run<br />\nthe intramural sports fairly<br />\nregardless of any Greek affiliation.<br />\nYou can also contact our staff<br />\nliaison, Mr. John Haus, at the<br />\nathletic center.<br />\nIn the tennis tournament last<br />\nweekend, FIJI was improperly excluded from the rescheduled tournament. They approached me, and we<br />\nworked out an acceptable compromise which allowed Bobby Z. to<br />\nenter the tournament which was<br />\nalready in progress.<br />\nWith regard to new members, the<br />\nBoard selection process is rather<br />\n<br />\nSenior<br />\n<br />\nsimple. Most of the people are<br />\nselected well before their interviews.<br />\nWe are looking for people who have<br />\npromoted good sportsmanship and<br />\nwho have been participating regularly. We are especially interested in<br />\nthose people who have helped us to<br />\nreferee games. If you apply for the<br />\nBoard, please think about what you<br />\nhave to contribute. Can you improve<br />\nthe BIA? Can you increase<br />\nparticipation?<br />\nIn conclusion, it would be naive<br />\nof me to dry that DU has received<br />\nmore than its fair share of breaks.<br />\nHowever, most of these problems<br />\nhave not been as flagrant as Mr.<br />\nLisak suggests, and all of them could<br />\nhave been resolved. The Board currently consists of 24 members, less<br />\nthan half of which are brothers of<br />\nDelta Upsilon, and every member<br />\nputs in considerable time and effort.<br />\nWe are arranging the sports tournaments for the Hopkins community. If you have positive suggestions,<br />\nlet us know. Everyone is welcome,<br />\nand BIA representatives are encouraged, to attend the Board<br />\nmeetings.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing this letter in response<br />\nto Michael Lisak:s \"quasi-gripe\"<br />\nabout how BIA is being run, or more<br />\nimportantly, how the Delta Upsilon<br />\nfraternity is destroying the quality of<br />\nlife for other Greeks.<br />\nIn his lambasting of DU, Mr.<br />\nLisak fails to realize that BIA is not<br />\nsynonymous with our fraternity. As<br />\nan organization, we actively encourage our members to involve<br />\nthemselves in a diverse selection of<br />\ncampus activities. The fact that<br />\nvarious DU brothers serve on BIA<br />\nis simply indicative of the type of<br />\nman our fraternity attracts. Their actions on behalf of BIA in no way<br />\nreflect or represent the general will<br />\nof our chapter.<br />\nThe executive board of DU found<br />\nLisak's reference to a \"private DU<br />\nparty\" at CVP disturbing.

But the failed \"Wilbury Twist\" (accompanied by a fairly extensive<br />\ngraphic on the insert) crosses the<br />\nline between silliness and outright<br />\nstupidity as it parodies the selfreferencing dance-craze records<br />\nof the Fifties.<br />\n\"Where Were You Last<br />\nNight\" finds Dylan trading off<br />\nvocals with Harrison over some<br />\nclassic rhymes (\"Where were<br />\nyou last week?/Were you up. . .<br />\na. . .creek?\u2014), and the former's<br />\nmissed harmonies on \"7 Deadly<br />\nSins\" are sort of endearing. But<br />\nonly \"Poor House,\" a Petty<br />\nraveup with an unmistakable Harrison wah-wah guitar lead, and<br />\n\"7 Deadly Sins\" have any rough<br />\nedges, the kind that make records<br />\nlike this fun. Volume 3 is too<br />\npolished for the mood\u2014it seems<br />\nlike it ought to be brimming with<br />\n<br />\nGods treat the supergroup as a<br />\nmeans of having fun rather than<br />\nmultiplicative creativity. But<br />\nwhere the Wilburys lack the<br />\nessential excitement of a master<br />\njam session, the Love Gods rely<br />\non nothing more than energy as<br />\ntheir covers take on first-take appeal.

Under howling winds<br />\nand a persistent drizzle, the Johns<br />\nHopkins football team escaped<br />\nfrom the wasteland of losing<br />\nyears by defeating Western<br />\nMaryland 31-21 for their first<br />\nwinning season since 1985 at<br />\n5-4-1.<br />\n\"It was a big win for the program in a lot of different ways,\"<br />\nsaid head coach Jim Margraff.<br />\n\"Having a winning season was<br />\none of our goals, and to be able<br />\nto get that in our first season is<br />\nvery exciting.

It<br />\njust became a lot of fun.\"<br />\nDefensively the Jays had their<br />\nproblems stopping Western<br />\nMaryland's running back Eric<br />\nFrees. Frees also touched the ball<br />\nthirty-seven times and ran for an<br />\nequally incredible 273 yards. The<br />\nJays however, managed to partially control Frees in the second<br />\nhalf, thereby stopping Western<br />\nMaryland's one-dimensional offense. Prior to the final drive of<br />\nthe game, the Green Terrors<br />\nmade two pass attempts: one for<br />\nan interception and the other an<br />\nincompletion.<br />\n\"Without a doubt, Frees is the<br />\nbest running back we've faced all<br />\nyear,\" said middle linebacker Stu<br />\nMarkley, who finished an<br />\noutstanding first season with the<br />\nBlue Jays by making twenty-three<br />\ntackles against the Green Terrors.<br />\n\"We like to stick it to people to<br />\nsee if they'll fold against us. I<br />\nthink that's what happened to<br />\ntheir other running back Johnson,<br />\nbut Frees kept right on running.\"<br />\nAfter both teams were stopped<br />\non their opening drives, the Jays<br />\npinned Western Maryland on the<br />\n<br />\ntwo yard line thanks to a 50-yard<br />\npunt form Tom Flynn. Two inconsequential runs gave the Terrors a third and 6 from the 6<br />\nbefore Frees exploded. Western<br />\nMaryland took advantage of a<br />\ndefensive lapse to open a gaping<br />\nhole that Frees bolted through for<br />\na 94 yard touchdown run.

On a third and 87 from the<br />\nJHU 43, Mont galloped for 32<br />\nyards. This set up a six yard run<br />\nby Mont and finally a 19 yard<br />\ntouchdown run by Paul Ferreri.<br />\nThe extra point, which by no<br />\nmeans was a sure thing on Saturday, was good, tying the contest<br />\nat seven apiece.<br />\n\"There wasn't going to be a<br />\nlot of passing in the game,<br />\nalthough we set some things up<br />\nto give us a chance to pass,\" said<br />\nMargraff. \"Aside form that, Paul<br />\n<br />\nNew,Improved BIA Notes<br />\nby Takashi Yokoyama<br />\nIt's that time of the year again<br />\nwhen the scent of roasted turkeys<br />\nwafts from kitchens everywhere<br />\nto distract all but the diehard BIA<br />\nenthusiasts.

Kutztown does not<br />\nhave an air rifle team, so there<br />\nwas no air rifle competion. The<br />\nfirst score is prone, the second<br />\nstanding, the third kneeling. Each<br />\nposition has a maximum possible<br />\nscore of 200 points, totaling 600<br />\noverall.<br />\nSenior Matt Fisher shot 188,<br />\n111, 170, which is very good for<br />\nprone and kneeling, but as for his<br />\nstanding, Fisher said, \"My<br />\ngrandmother can shoot better than<br />\nI did.\" Fisher's total was a 469.<br />\nSophomore Andy Bernstein shot<br />\n175, 150, 164, for a total of 489,<br />\nhis high in competition so far.<br />\nSophomore Raphael Yook shot<br />\n156, 89, 121, fora total of 366,<br />\na 33-point improvement over last<br />\nmatch.<br />\nFreshman Evan Bynum shot<br />\n159, 130, 165, totaling 454 and<br />\nimproving by 19.

He is already the<br />\nschool's all-time leading scorer<br />\nwith 1415 points. His career scoring average is 17.9 ppg, including<br />\n21.6 last season. He is also the<br />\nJays' all-time leading three-point<br />\nshooter, having nailed 161 in his<br />\nfirst three years. Perhaps the most<br />\namazing stat of all is his freethrow shooting. For his career he<br />\nis 308-337, a 91.4 percent mark.<br />\nThat is in the top five in the nation, including Division I players.<br />\nHis field goal shooting has also<br />\nbeen amazingly consistent: .522,<br />\n.521, and .529 in the past three<br />\nyears. Enfield is not one to leave<br />\nopen from an where on the court.<br />\n<br />\nBill Zahn<br />\nWhile his statistics speak for<br />\nthemselves, they do not tell the<br />\nwhole story. He is one of the<br />\nmost motivated players on the<br />\nteam. \"I don't have to say<br />\nanything to him,\" says head<br />\ncoach Bill Nelson. \"He's one of<br />\nthe most dedicated players I've<br />\never coached.\" His work ethic<br />\nrubs off on the newer players as<br />\nwell. \"When the young guys see<br />\nhim working that hard, it inspires<br />\nthem to work hard, too. Andy<br />\nsets a great example for the<br />\nteam.\"<br />\nEnfield has no specific personal<br />\ngoals, except to \"have a better<br />\nyear than I did last year.\" He is<br />\na legitimate shot to be a Division<br />\nIII All-American this year.<br />\n<br />\nrecord for steals last season with<br />\n58), an outstanding floor general,<br />\nand one of the best ballhandlers<br />\nin Hopkins history. In his threeyear career, he has dished out 254<br />\nassists, including 113 last year.<br />\nOne of Eikenberg's best<br />\nqualities is his familiarity with<br />\nHopkins' offensive system, in<br />\nparticular with Enfield's game.<br />\nNelson can practically send<br />\nEikenberg out on the floor and let<br />\nhim go to work. \"I don't have to<br />\ntell him what to do too much,\"<br />\nsaid Nelson. \"He knows what to<br />\ndo.\" Playing point guard is not<br />\njust dribbling up the floor and<br />\npassing off. It is a fine art that involves getting the ball to the right<br />\nperson in the right place at the<br />\nright time. It is making the right<br />\ndecision. With Eikenberg, the<br />\nresult is usually two points.<br />\nDavid Strong<br />\nStrong is one of the most<br />\ntalented players on the team. In<br />\nhis first two years, he split point<br />\nguard duties with Eikenberg,<br />\nbefore having to sit out last<br />\nseason with a back injury. He's<br />\nan excellent defensive player and<br />\nball handler and has an unusually good outside shot for a point<br />\nguard. Despite being sidelined,<br />\nStrong showed up at every practice and every game. \"He<br />\nwouldn't let the other guys slack<br />\noff,\" Nelson said. If he can come<br />\nback from the injury, Strong will<br />\nespecially be able to continue<br />\ncontributing to the team.<br />\nEric Hastings<br />\nHastings has been one of the<br />\nJays' best big men over the<br />\ncourse of his career. He is a good<br />\nlow post player and gets the job<br />\ndone on the boards. Perhaps his<br />\nbest attribute is his excellent<br />\nathletic ability for a big man. In<br />\naddition to his solid work ethic,<br />\nHastings is not one to sit out a<br />\ngame with a hangnail.

Hopkins had purposely squibbed their kicks to<br />\nkeep the ball away from Eric<br />\nFrees, who stood downfield as<br />\nthe kickoff returner. On this particular kickoff Trotta accidently hit one of the upfield<br />\nMockers with his kick. The ball<br />\nricocheted off the player and back<br />\ninto Trotta's hands. Since it was<br />\ncomparable to an onsides kick the<br />\nJays received the ball.<br />\n\"It's funny because they line<br />\none of their blockers over the<br />\nkicker, and Marzio kicked it, hit<br />\nthe kid and it bounced right back<br />\nto him,\" said Margraff.<br />\nHopkins employed their effective two minute offense and<br />\nscored again. Ferreri ran for 19<br />\nyards to Western Maryland's 40<br />\nyard line. The run set up two<br />\npasses to Ferreri for 14 and 23<br />\nyards respectively. The drive<br />\n<br />\nmoved the ball to the Western<br />\nMaryland 3, but then stalled.<br />\nTwo incomplete passes, and a 2<br />\nyard run by Ferreri moved the<br />\nball to the one.

He had carried twenty-three times for 188<br />\nyards in the first half, but was<br />\nclosely followed by Ferreri's thirteen carries for 131 yards.<br />\nWestern Maryland decreased<br />\nthe margin to three points in the<br />\nthird quarter after Dan Flynn<br />\nmuffed a bad snap and was<br />\ntackled on JHU's 32. Relying on<br />\nEric Frees, the Green Terrors<br />\nmoved to the 4 and allowed their<br />\nother running back Robert<br />\nJohnson to score. So with 8:22 in<br />\nthe third Hopkins maintained a<br />\n24-21 lead.<br />\nThe Blue Jays responded by<br />\nblocking a Western Maryland<br />\npunt in the fourth quarter. Dave<br />\nErfle, who made 10 tackles in his<br />\nfinal game at JHU, fought<br />\nthrough five blockers to get his<br />\nhand on the punt and redirected<br />\nit to Stu Markley.

Drawing support<br />\nfrom the Departments of English,<br />\nHumanities, and Writing<br />\nSeminars, the society will bring<br />\ntogether students in each of these<br />\ndisciplines for the study of<br />\nliterature to counterbalance the<br />\ndivision among the three areas.<br />\nNetworking the departments,<br />\nSechriest said, will provide a<br />\ncommon ground for fostering<br />\nliterary consciousness and exposure on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br />\norganizers,<br />\nFounding<br />\nSechriest, Cortwright McMeel,<br />\nChristine Zhubrod, and Adam<br />\nToll exhibit this unity as<br />\nrepresentatives of the three<br />\ndepartmental majors. The group<br />\nhas been working for two years<br />\nto establish the society.<br />\nThe Sidney Lanier Literary<br />\nSociety honors its namesake,<br />\nSechriest said, by holding the<br />\nman's ideas as its own, namely<br />\nbringing literature back to<br /><br />\nHopkins and reintroducing the<br />\nstudent population to the enjoyment of literary scholarship.<br />\nSechriest said that the organization sprung from a desire not only<br />\nto unite the closely related<br />\ndisciplines, but to fully express<br />\nthe diversity of the undergraduate<br />\npopulation here at Hopkins. As<br />\nSechriest stated at the first<br />\nmeeting, \"We [Hopkins] don't<br />\nreflect the diversity that is really<br />\nhere. We have the diversity; we<br />\njust don't show it.\"<br />\nMcMeel said that \"at Hopkins,<br />\nthings stay latent,\" referring to<br />\nthe underacknowledgement of the<br />\nhumanities and non-scientific<br />\nstudies. He pointed out that at<br />\nother prestigious universities<br />\nthere are several societies of<br />\nliterature on each campus<br />\nwhereas Hopkins only has one<br />\ngraduate literary society, the<br />\nTudor and Stuart Club.<br />\nthat<br />\nsaid<br />\nMcMeel<br />\nundergraduate societies for<br />\nstudents in science and engineering exist, promoting the appearance of a non-diverse student<br />\nbody.<br />\nThe primary goal of the society is to facilitate a lecture<br />\nseries, according to Sechriest. Initially tapping into the Hopkins<br />\nfaculty, the society, Sechriest<br />\nsaid, hopes to broaden the<br />\nbreadth of its speakers to include<br />\ncircuit lecturers and presentators,<br />\nwell-renowned in their literary<br />\nfield. These plans, Sechriest said,<br />\nmight include the appearance of<br /><br />\nRickey Denounces Racism and<br />\nThe David Duke Phenomenon<br /><br />\nPlans<br />\nFor<br />\nMcCoy<br />\nProposed<br /><br />\nby Stephanie Sneddon<br /><br />\nContinued from page 2<br />\n\"food court concept,\" which will<br />\nbe open until 2 or 3 a.m. Students<br />\nliving in these buildings will be<br />\nrequired to buy a meal plan, as<br />\nthe kitchenettes in the rooms are<br />\n\"not very practical,\" said Community Assistant Rich Quarles.<br />\nQuarles said that since the meal<br />\nplan is so expensive, the<br />\nsophomore year will become<br />\nmuch more costly. Miller said,<br />\nhowever, that \"Cost is always a<br />\nconsideration. We are very competitively priced in relation to the<br />\nrest of the community.\"<br />\nBoswell said that the cost of the<br />\nsophomore and freshman years<br />\nunder the plan would be roughly<br />\nequal.<br />\nThe concept of housemasters<br />\nand community assistants will<br />\nalso change. \"We will find a<br />\ncommon name for housemasters<br />\nand community assistants.

After sophomore<br />\nyear, students are more comfortable, and are more used to<br />\nthings. This would alleviate many<br />\nof these concerns.\"<br />\nQuarles said:\"I agree that it<br />\nwill create a sense of community, but I disagree with the way<br />\nthey're going about it. 1 think the<br />\nUniversity can fill McCoy<br />\nhousing<br />\nmaking<br />\nwitLout<br />\nmandatory.\"<br /><br />\nLoren Rieth<br /><br />\nFranklin Sechriest is one of the organizers of the Sidney Lanier Literary<br />\nSociety.<br />\na Sidney Lanier impersonator Sechriest and McMeel pointed<br />\nreading some of Lanier's work to out that by merely attending the<br />\ninaugurate the first lecture series meeting, students were already<br />\nof the Sidney Lanier Literary exhibiting Lanier-like qualities.<br />\n\"Lanier was quite a stoic [in<br />\nSociety.<br />\nNamed for the first professor terms of learning] and devoted to<br />\nof English at Hopkins, the society Johns Hopkins,\" said Sechriest.<br />\nmulti-talented Armed with Lanier's inspiration<br />\nhonors<br />\na<br />\nRenaissance man.

During a<br />\nresearch project she uncovered<br />\nDuke's extensive activity in the<br />\nKlu Klux Klan and neo-Nazi<br />\ngroups and since then, she said,<br />\nshe has been \"swimming<br />\nupstream\" in an attempt to inform people of Duke's past and<br />\npresent.<br />\nWhile researching Duke,<br />\nRickey uncovered a history of<br /><br />\nDuke's involvement in white suppremist groups.

According<br />\nto Rickey, he was subsequently<br />\ninvolved in organizing and runfling many white supremist<br />\ngroups such as White Citizen's<br />\nCouncil, the Klu Klux Klan,<br />\nWhich finTSed as-a \"respectable<br />\nfront\" for the American Nazi<br />\nParty, formerly the National<br />\nSocialist American Party. She<br />\ndescribed Duke's odyssey around<br />\nthe world where he found he was<br />\n\"destined to save the white race<br />\nfrom extinction.\" According to<br />\nRickey, he believed he was<br />\npoisoned by the Mossad and has<br />\nlived to fulfill his destiny.<br />\nRickey also recounted many<br />\nexperiences she has had in connection with Duke including extended interviews with him<br />\nwhere, she said, he tried to recruit<br />\nher into National Socialism. \"He<br />\nsaw me as a confused person, a<br />\nblood-ki n . . .duped by the<br />\nJewish media,\u2014 she said.

Race<br />\nmixing causes all problems.<br />\nUltimately segregation is the<br />\nideal, but it is difficult to do in<br />\nthe U.S.\"<br /><br />\nRickey described Duke as a<br />\nstrange extremist, who in addition<br />\nto running anti-semetic, pro-Nazi<br />\nliterature out of his State<br />\nLegislature's office, has, according to Rickey, written a sex<br />\nmanual for women and has had<br />\nextensive facial reconstruction.<br />\n\"A lot about Duke is very<br />\nbizarre,\" she said.<br />\nIn 1989, Rickey said she attended a closed meeting for the<br />\nNational American Socialist Party members where Duke encouraged others to run for<br />\nRepublican offices, saying,<br />\n\u2014That's where our people are.\"<br />\n\"David Duke was using the<br />\nRepublican Party for his own personal agenda,\" Rickey stated.<br />\nRickey spoke of her profound<br />\ndisillusion with the Republican<br />\nParty in Louisiana.

One unique aspect of<br />\nthe program, Walkowitz explained, is the cross-listing of<br />\ncourses, through which other<br />\ndepartments can offer courses<br />\nthat relate their respective areas<br />\nto Women's Studies or gender<br />\nissues. These course are considered to be included within that<br />\ndepartment and the Women's<br />\nStudies program simultaneously.<br />\nOver the course of a year, the<br />\nnumber of courses cross-listed<br />\nwith the Women's Studies program has risen from three to<br />\ntwenty, and is still growing. One<br />\nthird of these focus specifically on<br />\ngender issues.<br />\nWalkowitz will soon propose a<br />\nminor in Women's Studies, to be<br />\nconsidered by Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences Lloyd Armstrong. The<br />\nminor will offer students already<br />\npursuing a rigorous interdisciplinary study of gender<br />\nissues to receive formal recognition for their work.<br />\nAdditionally, the minor may<br />\nhelp to attract students to Hopkins<br />\nwho are interested in studying<br /><br />\nthese issues, and will give<br />\nWomen's Studies at Hopkins<br />\ngreater visibility in the academic<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe expansion of the program<br />\nreceived a great boost,<br />\nWalkowitz said, with a four-year<br />\n$150,000 grant from the Ford<br />\nFoundation.<br />\nSome of this money has gone<br />\nto fund a series of faculty<br />\nseminars, which help to promote<br />\nawareness of women's issues<br />\namong faculty from different<br />\ndisciplines by offering ideas about<br />\nways to incorporate aspects of<br />\ngender relations into their respective fields.<br />\nOf the twelve professors now<br />\ninvolved in the seminar program,<br />\nhalf are established scholars in<br />\nWomen's Studies, while others<br />\nare from fields such as International Relations, Environmental<br />\nEngineering, English, and<br />\nAnthropology.<br />\nWalkowitz called the consistent<br />\nand diverse attendance at the<br />\nseminars \"an exciting and gratifying experience.\" She observed that the program had<br />\nstimulated faculty to teach<br /><br />\ncourses related to Women's<br />\nStudies or to change the focus of<br />\ntheir courses to incorporate issues<br />\nof gender relations.<br />\nThe money from the Ford<br />\nFoundation will also go toward<br />\nencouraging undergraduates to<br />\nengage in independent research<br />\non \"topics related to women or<br />\ngender,\" either for credit or as<br />\npart of a senior thesis. Five<br />\nfellowships are available, each<br />\ncarrying a $2000 stipend for the<br />\nstudent and $800 for the advisor.<br />\nThe Ford grant also provides<br />\nfor a new lecture series begun this<br />\nyear, said Walkowitz. Most of<br />\nthe speakers will address topics,<br />\nconjoined with undergraduate<br />\ncourses cross-listed in Women's<br />\nStudies.<br />\nShe explained that one of the<br />\npurposes of the series is to expose<br />\nundergraduates to the professional academic community and<br />\nto encourage them to pursue<br />\nacademic interests beyond their<br />\nclasses. The lectures also allow<br />\nfor greater interaction between<br />\nundergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudents. In the past, most lee-<br /><br />\ntures offered have been geared<br />\ntoward graduate students only.<br />\nSaid Julie Hardwick, a<br />\ngraduate student in the Department of History who is focusing<br />\nher study on gender issues,<br />\n\"There was a lot of interest in<br />\nwomen's studies before this, and<br />\nthe program has helped to create<br />\na sense of community among<br />\nwomen [with an interest in<br />\nwomen's studies].\"<br />\nThere will also be a series of<br />\nfilms and speakers concerning<br />\nvarious aspects of women's issues<br />\nfor women's history month next<br />\nsemester, said Hardwick, who<br />\nwill be running the program. She<br />\nexpressed her hope that the series<br />\nwill help to draw in interested<br />\nundergraduates as well as<br />\ngraduate students.<br />\nWalkowitz is confident that<br />\nwhen the grant money runs out<br />\nthere will be enough interest<br />\ngenerated for the University to<br />\ncontinue to hind the aspects of the<br />\nprogram previously provided for<br />\nb) the Ford grant.<br /><br />\nsend those people to Congress.<br />\nDavid M.

Wrighton, at<br />\nhis first faculty meeting as provost, saw the situation as an opportunity for MIT to become a<br />\nleader in forging new policy, and<br />\nvowed to do \"all in his power\"<br />\nto work toward the change.<br />\nSome faculty members at the<br />\nmeeting felt that the resolution<br />\nwas not strong enough. Professor<br />\nof Literature Louis Kampf said he<br />\nwould vote for the measure<br />\nbecause \"if we don't pass it,<br />\nwe'll wind up with nothing.\"<br />\nKampf added that the resolution created \"a hint of a deadline,<br />\nbut not really a deadline,\"<br />\nwill<br />\nnot<br />\nMIT<br />\nbecause<br />\nautomatically break with ROTC<br />\nif the policy is not changed.<br />\nProfessor of Physics Vera<br />\nKistiakowsky shared Kampfs<br />\nsentiments.

I<br />\nfinally got sick enough of doing<br />\nmy Abnormal Psychology paper<br />\nover Thanksgiving vacation that<br />\nI figured I'd write to you. Hmm.<br />\nThat isn't much of a segue now,<br />\nis it?<br />\nI'm actually getting along<br />\nsomewhat well in my academics<br />\nhere, although this is currently<br />\nweek three of my advisor's apparent abduction. I'm beginning<br />\nto believe that \"office hours\" are<br />\nlisted so that you'd know what<br />\ntime the office would be there,<br />\nnot the advisor.<br />\nNot only that, but the registrar<br />\nhas absolutely no record of my<br />\ninter-term courses. After seeing<br />\nthem about it, they told me that<br />\nI had to check with the Department of Academic Advising. The<br />\nDepartment told me that I had to<br />\nfind the teacher and get her<br />\nsignature and bring it back here.<br />\nWell, when I found the teacher,<br />\nshe told me that the registrar had<br />\nlost all the grades and that there<br />\nwas a specific form that I had to<br />\nsign and return to Academic Advising. Upon returning to that<br />\ndepartment, they informed me<br />\nthat the forms were down at the<br />\nregistrar. I got the form and<br />\nreturned to my professor's<br />\ndepartment, but apparently her<br />\noffice hour was up, and she had<br />\nleft for vacation.<br />\nThis is what you're missing not<br />\ngoing to school.<br />\nSince Carol lives around here,<br />\nI'm up at her house for<br />\nThanksgiving. It's a whole lot<br />\ncheaper than heading out there for<br />\nthree days, but I still wish I could.<br />\nBesides, Carol's family, while<br />\nwonderfully nice, are stranger<br />\nthan Zack. Well, almost.<br />\nSpeaking of the Zackster, he<br />\nfinally showed me those comics<br />\nthat you said you were going to<br />\nsend. After realizing that he had<br />\nspent about the last week in our<br />\napartment, he remembered thlo<br />\nhe hadn't done his dishes before<br />\ncoming over to visit, so he ran<br /><br />\nback to his place to clean up<br />\nbefore the break. I swear, it was<br />\nthe first moment of silence that<br />\nI've had since he came over. He's<br />\ngreat, but he really needs to get<br />\nhis own life. I think he's getting<br />\nover Carol somewhat, though,<br />\nand hopefully that will give him<br />\nthe kick in the rear that he needs.<br />\nWe had a hell of a time getting<br />\nup here. Tell me if this sounds<br />\nfamiliar. Carol's parents had<br />\ntickets for us to see a Broadway<br />\nplay, so we were going to go<br />\nstraight to New York, meet them<br />\nat the restaurant, and then go for<br />\nthe play. We got to the train station about two minutes after the<br />\ntrain we wanted. So Carol went<br />\nup and asked how much more<br /><br />\nIn which Miranda<br />\ngets in touch with<br />\nDavid\u2014sort of<br />\ntickets were for the Metroliner<br />\n(the next train getting in).<br />\nThe guy gave a price which<br />\nwas more than the two of us had,<br />\nso I said we could use my money<br />\nmachine card to go get what we<br />\nneeded. Catch: they had closed<br />\nthe machine in the the station, so<br />\nwe had to run two and a half<br />\nblocks to the next closest one,<br />\nwhere we got stuck in line behind<br />\nsomeone slower than your<br />\nmother.<br />\nWe finally got the money and<br />\nran back to the station. Luckily,<br />\nthe train hadn't gotten in yet.<br />\nUnluckily, when Carol went to<br />\nget tickets, the guy said that the<br />\ntrain was txx)ked. Not that he told<br />\nus this when we asked about it or<br />\nanything. So we got the regular<br />\npriced tickets for the next train,<br />\nwhich hopefully would get us<br />\nthere with about a half-hour to<br />\neat. Carol called and told her<br />\nparents to order for us and when<br />\nwe would be there.<br />\nWell, the train got in about ten<br />\nContinued on page 17<br /><br />\nThis week the Tau Epsilon Phi fraternity went before<br />\nthe Inter-Fraternity Council Grievance Board for charges<br />\nof four violations of IFC rules. Three of the charges were<br />\ndropped, but TEP pled guilty to the fourth charge\u2014verbal<br />\nsexual harrassment. In the course of an already complicated<br />\nseries of events, a member of the fraternity spoke to a<br />\nwoman from the community in a way that the woman felt<br />\nconstituted sexual harrassment. The woman lodged a written complaint with the University, initiating an IFC investigation into the incident.<br />\nThe circumstances under which the infraction occurred<br />\nwere unusual. Still, regardless of location or situation,<br />\nfraternity brothers, like everyone else, have an obligation<br />\nto conduct themselves appropriately. As members of a<br />\nfraternity that operates with the sanction of the University, the TEP brothers had a further obligation to represent<br />\ntheir fraternity in a respectable manner and to comply with<br />\nIFC rules. The TEP brothers apparently recognize that the<br />\nincident was inappropriate and a violation\u2014they pled guilty<br />\nto the charge, cooperated with the investigation, and took<br />\nimmediate steps within the fraternity to penalize the brother<br />\nwho committed the offense.<br />\nThe real issue, then, is the ruling handed down by the<br />\nIFC Grievance Board. The fraternity was given a penalty<br />\nwhich some feel is both unduly harsh under the circumstances and inconsistent with past IFC rulings. TEP<br />\nbrothers claim that they have been treated unfairly. After<br />\nall, flagrant violations of IFC rules occur regularly without<br />\ncoming under the scrutiny of the Grievance Board or the<br />\nUniversity administration.<br />\nThe IFC ruling, though out of character, is not unfair.<br />\nThe prevalence of sexual harrassment incidents involving<br />\nfraternity members indicates that stricter attention and har-<br /><br />\nsher penalties are called for\u2014in fact, they were called for<br />\nlong ago. It may be that the IFC is truly concerned about<br />\ncurrent violations within the fraternities and is sending a<br />\nmessage that they will no longer be tolerated. It can justify<br />\nits action by addressing these insidious human climate problems regularly and with an even hand.<br />\nHowever, important questions remain regarding the ruling. For starters: why now? What aspect of this particular<br />\nincident prompted the harsh response from the Board?<br />\nThough any action taken to improve the human climate<br />\nat Hopkins is commendable, it is not clear that addressing<br />\nclimate problems on behalf of the students was indeed the<br />\nagenda of the Grievance Board.<br />\nThis event is marked by the presence of a community<br />\nmember not associated with the University. Lately, administrative offices here at Homewood have been bombarded with complaints from the community concerning<br />\nstudents. It seems that the relationship between students<br />\nand the rest of the community, delicate and tenuous under<br />\nthe best of circumstances, has recently become outright<br />\nhostile in many instances. There are many indications that<br />\nstudents in general are being unfairly and unreasonably<br />\ntargeted as destructive members of the community, and<br />\nare not given credit for their positive contributions to the<br />\narea.<br />\nAny steps toward improving the social environment and<br />\nquality of life here at Hopkins are worthy of support. But<br />\nit would certainly be unfortunate if, after years of internal criticism and much student energy devoted to these<br />\nissues, without comparable administrative action, Hopkins<br />\nresponded to unreasonable and unjustified pressure from<br />\noutside the University under the guise of addressing the<br />\n\"needs of the students.\"<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nRobert Rastelli: In Memoriam; TEP States Its Case<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nRobert Rastelli passed away<br />\nrecently. Many of you saw that funny, bouncy walk of his. Some of you<br />\nmay even have listened to his odd<br />\nmonotone voice at one time or<br />\nanother. Most of you never got a<br />\nchance to meet him because he was<br />\nso introverted, one of thousands of<br />\nfaceless people who drift in and out<br />\nof our lives every day. To me he<br />\nwasn't. There was so much to him<br />\nthat was so genuinely good, I can't<br />\njust let him slip quietly by without<br />\nan introduction. It's the least I could<br />\ndo. He was my friend.<br />\nI met Robert during fall registration 1989; my roommate and I sat on<br />\nthe fire escape pondering uses for the<br />\nspare bedroom in our apartment.<br />\nRobert popped his head out the window and introduced himslef, \"Hi,<br />\nI'm Rob Rastelli. I'm 21. I'm your<br />\nnew roommate.\" Without waiting<br />\nfor an answer, he popped his head<br />\nback in the window and disappeared<br />\nfor the next three months. When he<br />\nturned up I learned the depth of his<br />\ncharacter beneath the odd veneer.<br />\nHe was kind. About a month ago<br />\nhe wrote me describing a talk he'd<br />\nhad with a beggar by Greenmount<br />\nAvenue. Part of his letter read,<br />\n\"You, being who you are, probably<br />\nwonder why I stood and listened to<br />\nthis guy?\" I smiled, remembering<br />\nmany such stories where he astonished me with his naivete, and I him<br />\nwith my cynicism. He continued, \"I<br />\ndon't mind listening to their performances if they don't touch me and<br />\nI'm not in a hurry. I figure anyone<br />\nwho's so willing to suck up to white<br />\nasshole college students must really<br />\nneed the money. \"Listen,\" the beggar said, \"I've been fired. Can you<br />\nspare a few bucks? I've got to get my<br />\ndaughter some meat.\" Robert pulled a chicken pot pie from his shopping bag. The beggar hemmed and<br />\nhawed about how, no, she needed<br />\nmeat. Robert replied, \"It's got meat<br />\nin it. She'll like it.\" The conversation was ended.<br />\nRobert made me laugh. He could<br />\nbe almost like a cartoon character,<br />\na real loon. Last summer we went<br />\nskeet shooting a few times, passing<br />\ngrazing cows each time during the<br />\nride to Elk Neck state park. Once he<br />\npointed to one of them saying,<br />\n\"Let's plug that cow and tie it to the<br />\nhood of the VW. We'll mount the<br />\nhead as a trophy.\" Sportsmen that<br />\nwe were. Sometimes last year we'd<br />\nstay up watching TV into the night,<br />\nwell past the hour when Steven L.<br />\nMiles became ubiquitous. If we were<br />\nsober, we'd be half-crazed by the<br />\ntedium and laughing at something<br />\nthat probably wasn't at all funny.<br />\nOne of us would say, \"You know<br />\nmy smile hides a deep dark sorrow,\"<br />\nand then we'd toss our heads back<br />\nlaughing, each of us dead certain the<br />\nother was too airheaded to remotely<br />\nunderstand sorrow. We were both<br />\nwrong.<br />\n1 could write on well beyond the<br />\nlimits of your patience, but I won't;<br /><br />\nanyway, it's only fair that most of<br />\nthe memories remain my own. It<br />\npoured the day Robert was buried;<br />\neven the trees cried. It was so difficult to find solace in anything, not<br />\neven in his peaceful rest. Peace<br />\nalways seemed the furthest<br />\nthing from his mind; he was<br />\nlife<br />\nof<br />\nfull<br />\nso<br />\nalways<br />\nand had so much to give: These<br />\nmemories sustain me in my grief. I<br />\nwish I could close with something<br />\ncomforting, but such thoughts escape<br />\nme. I hope that all of us who knew<br />\nand loved him, family and friends<br />\nmight somehow find peace with<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nSteve Sirotic<br />\nClass of 1990<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn behalf of Tau Epsilon Phi, we<br />\nare writing to give the true version<br />\nof what has led us to be put on social<br />\nprobation. A neighbor of ours Ms.<br />\nKathleen Guzda sent a letter to the<br />\nschool which caused us to go in front<br />\nof the grievance board. Her account<br />\nis largely false and we would like to<br />\nsay what actually happened.<br />\nOn Oct. 10, Gary Chinn was fired<br />\nas the cook of Tau Epsilon Phi. That<br />\nevening he returned to the house to<br />\nsupposedly pick up some medication<br />\nwhich he had left behind. He was obviously intoxicated and talked with<br />\nthe brothers for quite some time<br />\nbefore slipping up the stairs unnoticed. A few minutes later one of our<br />\nbrothers saw him leave the premises<br />\nwith something hidden under his<br />\njacket and walk quickly up to<br />\nCanterbury St.<br />\nSuspecting that something may<br />\nhave been taken, he asked everyone<br />\nto check their valuables and upon doing so we discovered that Kevin<br />\nQuinn's tape deck was missing. At<br />\nthat point six of our brothers drove<br />\ndown the street to find him. At the<br />\ncorner of Canterbury and 39th we<br />\nsaw him walking with the tape deck.<br />\nOne of our brothers went to call<br />\nthe police while the rest of us got out<br />\nof the car and approached Mr.<br />\nChinn. Mr. Chinn then threw the<br />\ntape deck to the ground and tried to<br />\npush past us. We asked him to wait<br />\nfor the police to come. He took a<br /><br />\nswing at two brothers, one of which<br />\npushed Mr. Chinn to the ground<br />\nwhere he was held until the police<br />\narrived. He was then taken into<br />\ncustody by the police.<br />\nAt that time, we were asked if we<br />\nwished to file assault and/or theft<br />\ncharges against Mr. Chinn. Kevin<br />\nQuinn did file theft charges for<br />\nwhich Mr. Chinn was convicted. Of<br />\nficer Willis, the arresting officer,<br />\nwith whom we spoke as recently as<br />\nthis weekend, commended us for our<br />\nbehavior and gave us his number so<br />\nthat anyone who wishes to speak to<br />\nhim concerning the matter can do so.<br />\nThe real problems occured when<br />\nMs. Guzda arrived on the scene.<br />\nAfter we had been able to detain Mr.<br />\nChinn, she arrived yelling and<br />\nscreaming that a large group of upper class white boys (obviously<br />\noverlooking our black brothers)<br />\nwere beating up a poor black man<br />\nwhen in reality, not a single blow<br />\nwas struck other than the single push<br />\nit took to knock the intoxicated Mr.<br />\nChinn to the ground. She then continued to scream about us roaming<br />\nthe streets with a baseball bat.<br />\nAlthough we had grabbed a bat out<br />\nof the car for protection, no one had<br />\ncome even close to using it. Officer<br />\nWillis later stated that it was completely reasonable to bring it along<br />\nconsidering that Mr. Chinn has been<br />\narrested on numerous assault charges<br />\nwhich we were well aware of.<br />\nAt this point in time, some of our<br />\nbrothers attempted to explain the<br />\nsituation to Ms. Guzda, however she<br />\ndid nothing but continue to yell at us,<br />\nsaying such things as \"Poor babies,<br />\nyou can't live without the CD player<br />\nyour mommy and daddy pay for.\"<br />\nWith this type of abuse being<br />\nthrown our way and given the nature<br />\nof this situation, one of our brothers,<br />\nbrother X, lost his cool. He began<br />\nto shout back at this woman and<br />\nwhen she continued to insult him, he<br />\ntold her to -Get the hell out of here!<br />\nSuck my dick, lady.\" At that point<br />\nin time another brother approached<br />\nthe two of them and told brother X<br />\nto walk away, which he did.<br />\nFrom this point on, including in<br />\nthe presence of the police, she continued to harass all of our brothers,<br /><br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors.

This was why one of our<br />\nbrothers made a point of apologizing that same evening to Ms. Guzda. Brother X himself made an effort to apologize the next day;<br />\nhowever, he could not determine<br />\nwhere she resided.<br />\nAs a fraternity, the matter was<br />\ndiscussed in the executive board and<br />\nit was determined that brother X was<br />\nto be placed on social probation for<br />\nthe rest of the semester for being<br />\nrude to a neighbor. The matter was<br />\nfurther discussed with three<br />\nmembers of our national [fraternity<br />\nchapter] upon their receipt of Ms.<br />\nGuzda's letter of complaint. They<br />\nwere extremely pleased with the way<br />\nwe handled the situation and supported our behavior.<br />\nThat is what happened on the night<br />\nin question. At the trial on Monday<br />\n[Nov. 12], we read the allegations<br />\nwhich she wished to charge us with.<br />\nThey were largely fabricated with<br />\nnumerous embellishments. For example, Ms. Guzda mentioned in her<br />\nletter that young men were outside<br />\nher window repeating obscenities the<br />\nnext night. This is either a complete<br />\nlie or did not involve TEP. We<br />\ndidn't even know where she lived!<br />\nTEP was charged on four separate<br />\ncounts and plead not guilty to all but<br />\nthe count of verbal sexual harassment to which we plead guilty. We<br />\nwere completely cleared of all these<br />\ncharges. We fully cooperated with<br />\nthe IFC and the administration during this whole ordeal.<br />\nTEP feels that it has acted in a proper manner. The authority figure at<br />\nthe scene, Officer Willis, also stated<br />\nthat all of our actions with regards<br />\nto the stolen property were justified<br />\nand more than reasonable. Brother<br />\nX made his comment in the heat of<br />\nthe moment in a very unusual situation. He regrets it, as it was not<br />\nderived from any malice towards<br />\nMs. Guzda. As a fratenity, we truly<br />\nfeel that after this unfortunate incident we could not have dealt with<br />\nthis situation in a more responsible<br />\nand cooperative manner than we did.<br />\nUnfortunately, the IFC board<br />\nrendered a five-point decision of<br />\nwhich social probation through<br />\nMarch I is a part. TEP feels that this<br />\npunishment was caused by the executive board's desire to make an example of us and of a judicial process<br />\nwhich was tainted. They failed to<br />\nmake contact with any of our<br />\nwitnesses despite being offered their<br />\nnumbers to call and many of the<br />\ncomments which were made to the<br />\njury were in our opinion highly biased against us.<br />\nWe feel that the desire to punish<br />\nTEP far outweighed the desire to<br />\ndiscover what actually occured.<br />\nFinally, our cooperation in this mat-<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br /><br />\nScrew the Right Thing<br />\nStephen Kent Jusick<br />\nWith President Richardson<br />\nfully installed and making waves<br />\n(or at least ripples) about the importance of undergraduate education, various tongues of the administration have adopted<br />\nrhetoric spouting similar<br />\nmessages intended only to deflect<br />\ncriticism and elevate their own<br />\nstatus.<br />\nIn many ways, administrators<br />\nare like civil servants: people who<br />\nhave a minimum level of competence and are fairly secure in<br />\ntheir jobs. When a new President<br />\narrives, the herd must adapt. To<br />\ncurry favor, or stabilize their<br />\njobs, the public statements by the<br />\nlapdogs of official policy and sentiment may change in tone,<br />\nperhaps even in direct opposition<br />\nto earlier stances. But functionally, everything remains the same.<br />\nWhat this means now is that<br />\nlip-service\u2014and only that\u2014will<br />\nbe paid to student concerns,<br />\ndespite the more promising<br />\nemanations from Garland and<br />\nMerryman.<br />\nClearly, academic needs of the<br />\npopulation must be confronted.<br />\nSuggestions for desired and needed courses (Japanese, critical<br />\ntheory, anatomy, et al.) are too<br />\nquickly rebuffed at low levels of<br />\ndiscussion. Permanent advisors<br />\nshould be in place for majors<br />\nother than Pre-Med and Pre-Law.<br />\nBut there is an exigency in the<br />\narea of support services and dayto-day life. With curriculum<br />\nchanges choked by procedural<br />\nfilibustering and grant application<br />\npaperwork, it is easier to effect<br /><br />\ntheir<br />\nroles as<br />\npseudohousemasters. This is a result of<br />\nthe low ratio of CAs to student<br />\ncharges, leading to an intimate<br />\nrelationship that exists only in<br />\ntheory. This year CAs were placed in the Homewood, which officially established that building<br />\nas a \"significant\" dwelling for<br />\nundergrads.<br />\nThere are other campus<br />\nresources that can help students<br />\nwho are trying to cope. The most<br />\nobvious is the understaffed White<br />\nHouse, which counsels students<br />\nfor both one-time and continuing<br />\nneuroses. For many, however,<br />\nthe thought of psychological<br />\ncounseling carries a stigma.<br />\nWhat's an off-campus student to<br />\ndo if A Place To Talk isn't open?<br />\nThere are few options. The effect of the atmosphere at Johns<br />\nHopkins is akin to ripping the<br />\nscab from an infected wound.<br />\nWith a reputation as a grind<br />\nschool without a social life, JHU<br />\ncould serve as the Platonic ideal.<br />\nIt is this very want of an outlet<br />\nfor student anxieties and frustrations that can make a normally<br />\nbearable situation intolerable, or<br />\na dilemma into a crisis of<br />\ndevastating proportions. The<br />\nstress mounts exponentially,<br />\nfeeding upon itself, exacerbating<br />\nthe situation.<br />\nThe Human Climate Task<br />\nForce Report, released in the fall<br />\nof 1987, delineated many of these<br />\ntroubles with the University's<br />\ndisposition. Tentative steps are<br />\nnow being taken toward facing<br />\nsome of them, such as the treat-<br /><br />\nIf not the students themselves, who<br />\nwill make a concrete commitment to<br />\nthe mammoth task of bettering Hopkins'<br />\nsense of community?

Examples are<br />\nself-defense workshops and<br />\nalcohol awareness or wellness<br />\nprograms.<br />\nFor students who live in<br />\nUniversity<br />\nhousing, the<br />\nHousemasters and Community<br />\nAssistants(CAs) should provide<br />\na certain cushion for the stressed<br />\nacademic who wants to bail out.<br />\nThese positions can also provide<br />\na bridge through the seemingly<br />\nlayers<br />\nof<br />\nlabyrinthine<br />\nbureaucracy one encounters when<br />\nasking simple questions.<br />\nIn truth, CAs have yet to fulfill<br /><br />\nment of women. But others have<br />\nbeen shunted into the wings to<br />\nwait for a beneficient angel to<br />\ntake up their cause.<br />\nIf not the students themselves,<br />\nwho will make a concrete commitment to the mammoth task of<br />\nbettering Hopkins's sense of<br />\ncommunity? More important,<br />\nhow would it be done? One<br />\nperennial suggestion is to give<br />\nstudents\u2014graduates as well as<br />\nundergraduates\u2014a feeling that<br />\nthey belong. And it must be<br />\nsincere. Not a facade, deceptively<br />\npromising refuge, but some genuine compassion. It cannot be<br />\nthe usual formulaic mouthings<br />\nthat have the instruction \"insert<br />\nname here.\"<br />\nHoppy Hour has been lauded<br />\nas one of the most successful stu-<br /><br />\ndent events ever sponsored by the<br />\nUniversity. But even regular<br />\ngoers will acknowledge that the<br />\nweekly gathering, whose apparent attraction is cheap drinks,<br />\nis not a great place to meet new<br />\npeople.<br />\nAnd what does it say about the<br />\nFaculty-Student Interaction program that a paid student staff<br />\ncreates most of the events and approaches professors to act as<br />\nhosts? Where is the enthusiasm<br />\non the part of faculty for getting<br />\nto know those whom they are<br />\nteaching so occasionally?<br />\nThe hails of McCoy, the<br />\nHomewood and the Baltimorean<br />\nare cold and foreboding. Yet<br />\nstill, many prefer to hole up in<br />\ntheir depressing bed-sits rather<br />\nthan return .to campus for a<br />\nmeeting or lecture. Roach-ridden<br />\nand depressingly dull, these cells<br />\nof solitude are preferred to the socalled amenities of the campus.<br />\nHow can one choose insulation<br />\nover relation unless the ex-<br /><br />\nperience is thoroughly repulsive?<br />\nWhat kind of school is it where<br />\nthe only time the class gets<br />\ntogether is at graduation?<br />\nFreshmen used to get a handshake<br />\nfrom President Muller during<br />\ntheir orientation, but the experience served to fragment<br />\nrather than unite. This year<br />\nRichardson introduced what is intended to be a new tradition: convocation. The word itself means<br />\na calling together, which is a<br />\nmove in the right direction.<br />\nAt a campus where autonomy<br />\nis so highly valued, where individual will determines so much,<br />\nwhat thought is given to a collective well-being? At times of stress<br />\nand concern, perhaps what is<br />\nneeded is not isolation and<br />\nwithdrawal, but a sheltering environment providing succor. The<br />\nUniversity does this to some extent with the programs mentioned above, but it needs to do more.<br />\nAn atmosphere that is less competitive and more concerned with<br /><br />\nE-Level<br />\nthe condition of the human spirit<br />\nwould be a startling transformation, but an uplifting one.<br />\nRecent events on and off campus are cause for concern. People find themselves wrestling<br />\nwith questions about the practical<br /><br />\nKathy Korbuly<br />\nand philosophical quandaries nagging at their psyches. They must<br />\nknow\u2014or feel\u2014that Hopkins is a<br />\nplace where they can find some<br />\nsympathy for any conundrum.<br />\nSadly, as the events of the last<br />\nfew weeks have proven, it is not.<br /><br />\nEgo Dico<br />\nSeveral weeks ago I noticed in<br />\nthe News-Letter that for the second year in a row Hopkins had<br />\ndropped in that almighty indicator<br />\nof academic excellence, the U.S.<br />\nNews and World Report Annual<br />\nRanking of Universities. Well, I<br />\nrealize that the Five-Year Plan is<br />\nnot doing wonderful things for<br />\nthe quality of undergraduate<br />\neducation, but are we really falling down the slippery slope<br />\ntowards mediocrity?<br />\nTo help with my search I went<br />\nto the Admissions Office; they<br />\nare the ones who present the image of Hopkins towards tomorrow's college students. I expected<br />\nto hear that Hopkins is having difficulty attracting anybody to apply here, yet just the opposite is<br />\ntrue. In fact, the last three years<br />\nhave all been record years for<br />\nnumbers of applicants. Even<br />\nmore surprising, Director of Admissions Richard Fuller told me<br />\nthis year that his office has received a record number of early decision applicants, which is as good<br />\nan indicator as any for the total<br />\nnumber of applicants that<br />\nHopkins will receive this year.<br />\nI have to admit that I left the<br />\nplace a bit puzzled. After all, if<br />\nthe general campus consensus is<br />\nthat President pre-What's-HisName built up the flashy parts of<br />\nthe university at the cost of<br />\nundergraduates, why would more<br />\npeople than ever before want to<br />\ncome here? I offer several<br />\nhypotheses. First, the hype that<br />\nthe quality of undergraduate<br />\neducation is at an all-time low is<br /><br />\nBradley Cohen<br /><br />\nsimply wrong. Arguments can be<br />\nmade for or against this claim.<br />\nSecondly, prospective students<br />\nare either not aware of the FiveYear Plan or do not feel that it<br />\nwill affect them significantly.<br />\nThis hypothesis is stronger<br />\nbecause even with the full impact<br />\nof the Five Year Plan, Hopkins<br />\nis still smaller than Harvard or<br />\nStanford.<br />\nA third possibility, and the one<br />\nthat the Admissions Office would<br />\nlike you to believe, is that<br />\nHopkins is becoming a trendy<br />\nplace\u2014 a la Duke or<br />\nGeorgetown. Somehow, I just<br />\ncannot accept this one. Since<br />\nwhen has a tremendous workload<br />\nand mounds of stress been<br />\npopular? Still, numbers do not<br />\nlie.<br />\nAt this point, try to remember<br />\nthe reasons that you applied here<br />\nin the first place. My personal<br />\nfavorite line is \"I applied to<br />\nHopkins as my safety school.\"<br />\nYeah, right. The number of people who actually applied here<br />\nbecause it was their safety school<br />\nis probably no higher than the<br />\nlargest single-digit prime number.<br />\nThe reasons that we applied<br />\nhere are the same reasons that<br />\nstudents applied here ten years<br />\nago and continue to be the same<br />\nreasons today. Small size,<br />\nacademic flexibility, and the opportunity for independent work<br />\nare the main attractions of Johns<br />\nHopkins. Today we may complain about the ills the Five-Year<br />\nplan is creating, but those<br />\nqualities which attracted us to<br /><br />\nHopkins in the first place still<br />\nexist.<br />\nSo, where does that leave us?<br />\nShould one feel alarmed about the<br />\nU.S. News ranking or proud that<br />\nHopkins is becoming such a<br />\npopular place? After thinking<br />\nabout it for a while, I would venture that one should feel glad<br />\nabout being here. After all, the<br />\nquality of the faculty, with the exception of the French Department, remains the same, While<br />\nthe University's facilities, if<br />\nanything, have improved.<br />\nIf you still remain unconvinced, think of this. Recently Stanford announced that it was facing<br />\na budget deficit and would also<br />\ninclude faculty layoffs. Thus, the<br />\nproblems of Hopkins are not unique:. we were just forced to deal<br />\nwith ours sooner. After years of<br />\ngo-go growth, universities, like<br />\nany other part of the economy,<br />\nare going to have to go through<br /><br />\nEAi<br /><br />\nJA<br /><br />\na period of downsizing.<br />\nThe ultimate effects of this<br />\nnation-wide academic downsizing<br />\nhave yet to be determined.<br />\nHopkins could emerge as a<br />\nsmaller, more well-balanced<br />\nplace or it could be more imbalanced than ever before. In<br />\nthinking about the future of<br />\nHopkins, one can only hope that<br />\naccolades that have been given to<br />\nPresident Williamson (or was it<br />\nRichardson?) are accurate. Otherwise, Hopkins may end up in the<br />\nsecond most important category<br />\nof the U.S. News rankings, the<br />\nschools that are \"Up and Comers.\"<br />\nThe News-Letter:<br />\nBringing Johns Hopkins news<br />\nto you since 1897.*<br /><br />\n1501ND<br /><br />\n3-.H.

DiIda, Bursar<br />\nKevin M. Quinn, Vice Chancellor<br />\nTau Epsilon Phi Fraternity<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe purposes of this letter are twofold. First, I would like to address<br />\nthe letter to the editor submitted by<br />\nMr. Lisak and the brothers of ATO<br />\n[Letters, Nov. 91. Second, I would<br />\nlike to inform the Hopkins community about our intramural athletics<br />\nprogram.<br />\nLet me begin with flag football.<br />\nThe play-off schedule was posted on<br />\nThursday, 10/11/90, at the cage in<br />\nthe athletic center. At that time SAM<br />\nhad a perfect record of 3-0, and<br />\nATO was 2-0-1. Being seeded second, SAM was scheduled to play<br />\nseventh ranked DU (2-1). ATO was<br />\nseeded fourth, so they were scheduled to play fifth ranked FIJI (2-1).<br />\nATO had previously been scheduled to play SAM on 10/4/90.<br />\nHowever, the game was mutually<br />\npostponed until the following week<br />\non 10/12/90. ATO defeated SAM<br />\nand should therefore have been<br />\nscheduled to play DU in the first<br /><br />\nround of the play-offs seedings, but<br />\nDU defeated ATO in the second<br />\nround 13-12.<br />\nAs Mr. Lisak pointed out, the outdoor soccer tournament was run with<br />\nincompetence. There were problems<br />\ngetting people to referee the games,<br />\nand the winners in all of the<br />\ninbrackets\u2014dormitories,<br />\ndependents, and fraternities\u2014were<br />\nscheduled to play consecutive<br />\ngames. After trying to piece together<br />\nthe weekend's results, the Board is<br />\ncurrently rerunning the tournament.<br />\nOnly the fraternity results were left<br />\nuntouched. Giving the past year's<br />\nchampions byes, if such a need<br />\narises, is a commendable suggestion;<br />\nhowever, none of the results from<br />\nlast year were kept, and it is difficult<br />\nto determine how the teams placed.<br />\nThe suggestion was used in the<br />\nlacrosse tournament this weekend.<br />\nAt this point. I would like to<br />\napologize for the actions of the<br />\nBoard member at the soccer tournament. He acted inappropriately, and<br />\nhe was reprimanded accordingly that<br />\nweekend. If a team fails to show a<br />\nfull squad within 10 minutes of the<br />\nscheduled event, then that team<br />\nautomatically forfeits that event.<br />\nSince it is a BIA by-law, there is no<br />\nneed to protest. If there are any further questions about these by-laws,<br />\nplease call me at 338-8788 or stop<br />\nby Sylvester 106.<br /><br />\nFrom what I have been able to<br />\ngather about the indoor soccer, there<br />\nwere four teams with records which<br />\nmade them eligible for the play-offs:<br />\nSigEp (2-1), DU (2-1), ATO (3-0),<br />\nand PhiPsi (1-1). DU should have<br />\nplayed SigEp and ATO should have<br />\nplayed PhiPsi. ATO schould have<br />\ncontacted Dominick Wiker concerning the actual pairings. If there are<br />\nany problems, you must contact the<br />\nBoard member running the sport. If<br />\nyou are not satisfied with his/her<br />\nresponse, then you can contact me.<br />\nThe Board has a responsibility to run<br />\nthe intramural sports fairly<br />\nregardless of any Greek affiliation.<br />\nYou can also contact our staff<br />\nliaison, Mr. John Haus, at the<br />\nathletic center.<br />\nIn the tennis tournament last<br />\nweekend, FIJI was improperly excluded from the rescheduled tournament. They approached me, and we<br />\nworked out an acceptable compromise which allowed Bobby Z. to<br />\nenter the tournament which was<br />\nalready in progress.<br />\nWith regard to new members, the<br />\nBoard selection process is rather<br /><br />\nSenior<br /><br />\nsimple. Most of the people are<br />\nselected well before their interviews.<br />\nWe are looking for people who have<br />\npromoted good sportsmanship and<br />\nwho have been participating regularly. We are especially interested in<br />\nthose people who have helped us to<br />\nreferee games. If you apply for the<br />\nBoard, please think about what you<br />\nhave to contribute. Can you improve<br />\nthe BIA? Can you increase<br />\nparticipation?<br />\nIn conclusion, it would be naive<br />\nof me to dry that DU has received<br />\nmore than its fair share of breaks.<br />\nHowever, most of these problems<br />\nhave not been as flagrant as Mr.<br />\nLisak suggests, and all of them could<br />\nhave been resolved. The Board currently consists of 24 members, less<br />\nthan half of which are brothers of<br />\nDelta Upsilon, and every member<br />\nputs in considerable time and effort.<br />\nWe are arranging the sports tournaments for the Hopkins community. If you have positive suggestions,<br />\nlet us know. Everyone is welcome,<br />\nand BIA representatives are encouraged, to attend the Board<br />\nmeetings.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing this letter in response<br />\nto Michael Lisak:s \"quasi-gripe\"<br />\nabout how BIA is being run, or more<br />\nimportantly, how the Delta Upsilon<br />\nfraternity is destroying the quality of<br />\nlife for other Greeks.<br />\nIn his lambasting of DU, Mr.<br />\nLisak fails to realize that BIA is not<br />\nsynonymous with our fraternity. As<br />\nan organization, we actively encourage our members to involve<br />\nthemselves in a diverse selection of<br />\ncampus activities. The fact that<br />\nvarious DU brothers serve on BIA<br />\nis simply indicative of the type of<br />\nman our fraternity attracts. Their actions on behalf of BIA in no way<br />\nreflect or represent the general will<br />\nof our chapter.<br />\nThe executive board of DU found<br />\nLisak's reference to a \"private DU<br />\nparty\" at CVP disturbing. We are<br />\nin the process of issuing a reprimand<br />\nto all brothers involved for not inviting the rest of us.

When<br />\npositrons meet electrons, light in<br />\nthe form of gamma rays is given<br />\noff. A camera then detects the<br />\ngamma rays and pinpoints the<br />\nlocation of the molecule. By injecting radioactive compounds into the bloodsteam, the PET scan<br />\ncan show where in the body the<br />\ncompound may be.<br />\n\"The brain is like a computer,\" Fox says. \"Information<br />\ncan be processed and transformed in much the same way data input is transformed into different<br />\nfunctions by a computer.\" Yet<br />\ndifferent functions occur in different areas of the brain and are<br />\nspecific to that area.<br />\nThus, if a person has a lesion<br />\non a part of the brain which processes his ability to distinguish<br />\nfaces, a person may still be able<br />\nto read and see normally but may<br />\nnot be able to tell one person from<br />\nanother.<br />\nThe PET can be used to see<br />\nwhat type of behavior is governed by what certain area of the<br />\nbrain. This is done by injecting<br />\nradioactive water into the blood<br />\nstream. As water flows<br />\nthroughout the different parts of<br />\nthe body in the blood, increased<br />\nactivity in a certain part of the<br />\nbrain will draw more blood there<br />\nbecause of metabolic needs.<br />\nThe PET camera takes 2 pictures during this procedure. One<br />\nis taken in the resting stage of the<br /><br />\nsubject.

For example, when a person looks at a<br />\nword such a \"top\" and another<br />\none such as \"kxsb,\" he knows<br />\nthat \"top\" is a word and \"kxsb\"<br />\nis not because \"kxsb\" does not<br />\nappear to be orthographically<br />\ncorrect.<br />\nThe first step in sorting out<br />\nwords from non-words is a visual<br />\ntest rather than a mental process.<br />\nWhen the subject is presented<br />\nwith \"top\" and \"kxsb,\" the first<br />\nthing he does is determine if a<br />\nmeaning for either of the two<br />\nwords exists. But he does this<br />\nafter the words have passed the<br />\nvisual test of being or-<br /><br />\ndeveloped. \"Hopkins is going to<br />\nget a new PET scan and a<br />\ncyclotron,\" said Fox. \"I feel<br />\nvery positive about the progress<br />\nof PET since many collaborators<br />\nwith diverse interests ranging<br />\nfrom radiology and neurology to<br />\ncognitive science and psychology<br />\nare working on it. There is much<br />\npotential for this device, even<br />\nperhaps for clinical purposes.\"<br />\nAlready, the PET has proven<br />\nhelpful in identifying areas of<br />\nepileptic seizures in the brain and<br />\nin mapping the language processor in patients undergoing<br />\nbrain surgery. In this way, a<br />\nsurgeon can avoid accidentally<br />\ndamaging the language processor<br />\nwhile performing surgery.<br /><br />\nDonna Williamson<br /><br />\nDr. Fox uses PET scans to probe deep into the brain without a single incision.<br /><br />\nBiodegradable Polymers Aid in<br />\nthe Treatment of Diseases<br />\nby Linda Chen<br />\nBiodegradable polymeric controlled drug delivery is currently<br />\nan active and important area of<br />\nresearch in the pharmaceutical industry. Professor Kam Leong in<br />\nthe Department of Biomedical<br />\ndesigns<br />\nEngineering<br />\nbiodegradable polymers as drug<br />\ncarriers, making it possible to<br />\ncontrol the amount of drug<br />\ndelivered in the body without the<br />\npatient having to worry about<br />\nforgetting his medication or overdosage. The biodegradable<br />\npolymer dissolves at a particular<br />\nrate depending on the complexity of this long-chained molecule,<br />\nthereby releasing the drug. Synthetic polymers are used because<br />\nnatural biopolymers lack this<br />\nflexibility.<br />\nBiodegradable polymers are<br />\nalso used for purposes other than<br />\ndrug delivery. Naturally<br />\nreconstituted collagen has been<br />\nused to dress wounds which are<br />\nthen gradually eliminated by the<br />\nbody's own enzyme collagenase.<br />\nHowever, as with many<br />\nbiopolymers, collagen does not<br />\ndissolve at a regular rate. Timereleased polymers have been<br />\nalready used to treat cases, but<br />\nmany years of research are needed to investigate and refine this<br />\nprocess further.<br />\nDr. Henry Brem, a Hopkins<br />\nutilizing<br />\nneurologist, is<br />\nbiopolymers as an aid in the treatment of brain tumors. His work<br />\ninvolves implanting an anti-tumor<br />\ndrug into the brains of other ter-<br /><br />\nuse of pol-phosphate esters instead of metal pins to heal bone<br />\nfractures. The advantage of this<br />\ntype of technology is that surgery<br />\nwould only be required once<br />\nwhen the support device is implanted. After that, the bone<br />\nwould actually strengthen,<br />\npreventing the chance of a refracture in the near future.<br />\nLeong's lab, currently the only one in the U.S. manufacturing<br />\nand using these poly-phosphate<br />\nesters for biomedical applications, has taken on three different<br />\ndirections, including controlled<br />\nrelease of drugs, orthopedics, and<br />\ncell response. The major obstacle<br />\nin these cases is in proving the<br />\nlong term safety of the drug for<br />\nuse in humans to the FDA.<br />\nSpeculating about the future of<br />\nthis research area, Leong<br />\nsaid,\"The impact of polymeric<br />\nbiomaterials in medicine is expected to increase significantly in<br />\nthe years ahead.\" Some possible<br />\ndirections for research include<br />\nuse with contraception and insulin<br />\ntherapy in various forms such as<br />\nmicrospheres, matrices and membranes. Ongoing research in the<br />\nfields of liposomal and electromechanical technology and<br />\nmore sophisticated fabrication<br />\ntechniques is also important. The<br />\npossibilities for research on this<br />\nfield could span a whole new era<br />\nas researchers overcome the difficulties in developing the<br />\nmaterials and begin to discover<br />\nCurrently, Leong is testing the applications.<br /><br />\nminally ill patients. The implant<br />\nin the form of a polymeric wafer<br />\ndeveloped by Nova Pharmaceuticals, works to steadily<br />\nmaintain the dosage level of the<br />\ndrug in the brain.<br />\nPreviously, doctors could only inject the anti-tumor drug<br />\nBCNU directly into the body. It<br />\nmetabolizes too quickly,<br />\nhowever, reducing its effectiveness. In 15 minutes, half of<br />\nthe administered dosage is gone.<br />\nRaising the dosage level to extend<br />\nthe time it remains in the body<br />\nwould lead to unacceptable toxic<br />\neffects. The polymeric controlled drug delivery supplies a steady<br />\nlevel of the drug for three weeks.<br />\nAnother promising application<br />\nof this technique is a treatment for<br />\nglaucoma. Glaucoma occurs<br />\nwhen too much liquid builds up<br />\nbehind the eye's outer wall, causing blindness if left untreated. In<br />\nthe past, methods of treatment<br />\nwere limited to eye drops, laser<br />\nsurgery, or opening up a small<br />\nhole in the eye to allow the fluid<br />\nto drain. To prevent this buildup<br />\nof fluid, patients frequently are<br />\ntreated with 5-fluorouacil.<br />\nHowever, as with many other<br />\ndrugs, an increased dosage must<br />\nbe injected to insure that the drug<br />\ngoes where it is needed.

The<br />\nleaves of spring fall limply aside<br />\nas our Blue Jays end another<br />\nseason of bore. NO MORE! They<br />\nsaid, NO MORE!<br />\nOk, while the attempt to be the<br />\nnext T.S. Eliot failed miserably,<br />\nJHU accomplished its goal on<br />\nSaturday. Under howling winds<br />\nand a persistent drizzle, the Johns<br />\nHopkins football team escaped<br />\nfrom the wasteland of losing<br />\nyears by defeating Western<br />\nMaryland 31-21 for their first<br />\nwinning season since 1985 at<br />\n5-4-1.<br />\n\"It was a big win for the program in a lot of different ways,\"<br />\nsaid head coach Jim Margraff.<br />\n\"Having a winning season was<br />\none of our goals, and to be able<br />\nto get that in our first season is<br />\nvery exciting. No matter what the<br />\noutcome, we were very proud of<br />\nhow our players played all year.\"<br />\nThe victory would have been<br />\nimpossible without an extraordinary effort from the offense led<br />\nby Paul Ferreri. The sophomore<br />\nrunning back tore through the<br />\nGreen Terrors' defense thirtyseven times for 252 yards and<br /><br />\nfour touchdowns.<br />\n\"I was very happy with how<br />\nmany attempts I was given,\" said<br />\nFerreri. \"I've never received as<br />\nmany carries in high school. It<br />\njust became a lot of fun.\"<br />\nDefensively the Jays had their<br />\nproblems stopping Western<br />\nMaryland's running back Eric<br />\nFrees. Frees also touched the ball<br />\nthirty-seven times and ran for an<br />\nequally incredible 273 yards. The<br />\nJays however, managed to partially control Frees in the second<br />\nhalf, thereby stopping Western<br />\nMaryland's one-dimensional offense. Prior to the final drive of<br />\nthe game, the Green Terrors<br />\nmade two pass attempts: one for<br />\nan interception and the other an<br />\nincompletion.<br />\n\"Without a doubt, Frees is the<br />\nbest running back we've faced all<br />\nyear,\" said middle linebacker Stu<br />\nMarkley, who finished an<br />\noutstanding first season with the<br />\nBlue Jays by making twenty-three<br />\ntackles against the Green Terrors.<br />\n\"We like to stick it to people to<br />\nsee if they'll fold against us. I<br />\nthink that's what happened to<br />\ntheir other running back Johnson,<br />\nbut Frees kept right on running.\"<br />\nAfter both teams were stopped<br />\non their opening drives, the Jays<br />\npinned Western Maryland on the<br /><br />\ntwo yard line thanks to a 50-yard<br />\npunt form Tom Flynn. Two inconsequential runs gave the Terrors a third and 6 from the 6<br />\nbefore Frees exploded. Western<br />\nMaryland took advantage of a<br />\ndefensive lapse to open a gaping<br />\nhole that Frees bolted through for<br />\na 94 yard touchdown run. The<br />\npoint after was good giving the<br />\nTerrors a 7-0 lead.<br />\n\"They lined up in wishbone,<br />\nbut motioned out of it,\" said<br />\nMarkley. \"We were caught in the<br />\nmiddle of changing our defense,<br />\nso Frees had a hole you could<br />\nhave run a truck through.\"<br />\nThe Jays immediately came<br />\nback on their subsequent drive.<br />\nStarting from the 41 yard line, the<br />\nJays ran the ball using the familiar<br />\ncombination of Ferreri and Erik<br />\nMont. On a third and 87 from the<br />\nJHU 43, Mont galloped for 32<br />\nyards. This set up a six yard run<br />\nby Mont and finally a 19 yard<br />\ntouchdown run by Paul Ferreri.<br />\nThe extra point, which by no<br />\nmeans was a sure thing on Saturday, was good, tying the contest<br />\nat seven apiece.<br />\n\"There wasn't going to be a<br />\nlot of passing in the game,<br />\nalthough we set some things up<br />\nto give us a chance to pass,\" said<br />\nMargraff. \"Aside form that, Paul<br /><br />\nNew,Improved BIA Notes<br />\nby Takashi Yokoyama<br />\nIt's that time of the year again<br />\nwhen the scent of roasted turkeys<br />\nwafts from kitchens everywhere<br />\nto distract all but the diehard BIA<br />\nenthusiasts.

Hopkins had purposely squibbed their kicks to<br />\nkeep the ball away from Eric<br />\nFrees, who stood downfield as<br />\nthe kickoff returner. On this particular kickoff Trotta accidently hit one of the upfield<br />\nMockers with his kick. The ball<br />\nricocheted off the player and back<br />\ninto Trotta's hands. Since it was<br />\ncomparable to an onsides kick the<br />\nJays received the ball.<br />\n\"It's funny because they line<br />\none of their blockers over the<br />\nkicker, and Marzio kicked it, hit<br />\nthe kid and it bounced right back<br />\nto him,\" said Margraff.<br />\nHopkins employed their effective two minute offense and<br />\nscored again. Ferreri ran for 19<br />\nyards to Western Maryland's 40<br />\nyard line. The run set up two<br />\npasses to Ferreri for 14 and 23<br />\nyards respectively. The drive<br /><br />\nmoved the ball to the Western<br />\nMaryland 3, but then stalled.<br />\nTwo incomplete passes, and a 2<br />\nyard run by Ferreri moved the<br />\nball to the one. On fourth down<br />\nMargraff elected to go for the<br />\nfield goal and was rewarded by<br />\nTrotta's perfect chip shot.<br />\nHopkins went into halftime with<br />\na 24-14 lead and were no doubt<br />\nhappy Frees had not scored at an<br />\nuncontrollable pace. He had carried twenty-three times for 188<br />\nyards in the first half, but was<br />\nclosely followed by Ferreri's thirteen carries for 131 yards.<br />\nWestern Maryland decreased<br />\nthe margin to three points in the<br />\nthird quarter after Dan Flynn<br />\nmuffed a bad snap and was<br />\ntackled on JHU's 32. Relying on<br />\nEric Frees, the Green Terrors<br />\nmoved to the 4 and allowed their<br />\nother running back Robert<br />\nJohnson to score. So with 8:22 in<br />\nthe third Hopkins maintained a<br />\n24-21 lead.<br />\nThe Blue Jays responded by<br />\nblocking a Western Maryland<br />\npunt in the fourth quarter. Dave<br />\nErfle, who made 10 tackles in his<br />\nfinal game at JHU, fought<br />\nthrough five blockers to get his<br />\nhand on the punt and redirected<br />\nit to Stu Markley.

The cohesiveness<br />\nthat was supposed to develop<br />\nnever did, leaving the squad looking for answers as it unwillingly<br />\nrelinquished its crown.<br />\n\"It was fun, but I'm relieved<br />\nit's over,\" concluded Jones.<br />\n\"I'm looking forward to getting<br />\na better start on next year.\"<br /><br />\nwatching the line of scrimmage,<br />\nbut soon heard the call to glory<br />\nby catching the tipped ball rumbling, bumbling and finally stumbling down to Western Maryland's<br />\n25 yard line.<br />\n\"Dave Erfle made an almost<br />\nsuperhuman effort,\" said<br />\nMargraff.<br />\nThe Jays stayed on the ground<br />\nby employing the services of Ferreri and Company. Hopkins completed the drive with a 9 yard<br />\njaunt from the chairman of the<br />\nboard, Mr. Ferreri. The extra<br />\npoint made the score 31-21 and<br />\nleft the Homewood Hoard and<br />\ntheir leader Dr. Richardson in<br />\necstacy, or at least in high spirits.<br />\nThe win gave the Jays third place<br />\nin the conference (which was won<br />\nby Dickinson).<br /><br />\nSeniors Lead<br />\nJays Into<br />\nNew Season<br />\nContinued from page 16<br />\nEikenberg to set him up for his<br />\nfavorite shot, the 12-foot baseline<br />\njumper.
