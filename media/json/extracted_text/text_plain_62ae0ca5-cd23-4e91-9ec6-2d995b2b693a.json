The group<br />\nalso participated in letter-writing<br />\nactivities and petition circulation.<br />\nThis semester, in addition to<br />\nexpanding and improving the<br />\nrecycling program, one of the<br />\ngroup's main goals is to increase<br />\nawareness of environmental<br />\nissues on campus. The group<br />\nplans to do this through flyers,<br />\nposters, and guest speakers. The<br />\ngroup is also working closely<br />\nwith the Office of the Chaplain on<br />\nplanning Earthweek '90.

Although there have been some<br />\nworrisome suggestions of late (such as the proposition to<br />\nmerge the Departments of French and Italian Studies,<br />\nresulting in the former's zealous reservation of airline<br />\ntickets to Emory University), it is heartening to see ongoing commitment to the new Women's Studies program,<br />\nforward steps in such troubled areas as Classics, and a new<br />\ntenured professor in Mathematics.<br />\nUndergraduate life has resumed with a soothing sense<br />\nof business-as-usual. The current freshman class seems to<br />\nhave allayed widespread fears that its increased size would<br />\nyield a bunch of morons.(Indeed, the new group's statistics<br />\nare even more impressive than those of last year's freshman<br />\nclass) The robust condition in which many student groups<br />\nfind themselves\u2014from the News-Letter to The<br />\nBarnstormers\u2014 is also encouraging.<br />\nStill, the absence of acceptable lecture hall space to house<br />\nlarge, freshman -dominated classes such as<br />\nMicroeconomics and Contemporary International Politics<br />\nshould indicate that Homewood cannot suffer another boost<br />\nin enrollment. One hopes this is apparent to administrators<br />\nconcerned by the overburdened faculty.<br />\nStudent Council's persistent contact with Dean of Arts<br />\nand Sciences Lloyd Armstrong has yielded some potentially effective committees to this end, and to the prospect<br />\nthat undergraduate concerns may actually be respected at<br />\nthe administrative level. The short-term monitoring committee and the Five-Year Plan Committee, ostensibly<br />\ncreated as quality-control devices, are particularly encouraging. Maintain hope that the days of the Parking<br />\nCommittee are over.<br />\nAcademics aside, the Student Activities Office is sailing with a full crew this year, notably with its new Student Activities Director, William Smedick. Though former<br />\ndirector Susan Boswell (who has since become Dean of<br />\nStudents) is a hard act to follow, Smedick's amiable style<br />\nand impressive qualifications bode well for coherent student support.<br />\nWe are encouraged, too, by Funk Night's return to the<br />\nGrad Club this fall, particularly in light of its success at<br />\nthe end of last year. The Grad Club's quick start this fall,<br />\nwith good programming and solid crowds, confirms a<br />\nsense that the Hopkins community is significantly more<br />\ninterested in campus life now than in previous years.<br />\n<br />\nAll of which leaves us feeling better about Hopkins than<br />\nwe did as the year began. It is a credit to the efficacy of<br />\nthe Dormitory Housing, Student Activities, and Academic<br />\nAdvising Offices that the shift to a larger freshman class<br />\nhas been smooth, but burgeoning class sizes are already<br />\nalarming. Broader, pivotal questions as to the direction<br />\nin which the School of Arts and Sciences is headed remain unanswered. But there is dialogue, and we are<br />\nencouraged.<br />\n<br />\nCoping with abuse<br />\n<br />\nGoing off to college for the first time opens doors to<br />\nmany new experiences. The tastes of freedom which accompany freshman year are often the first of their kind<br />\nfor students entering Hopkins. Campus life offers new people, places and ideas, many stimulating and imbued with<br />\nthe novelty of making most of one's own decisions. Unfortunately, an equal number of factors can make the college campus less than idyllic; stress, drugs, alcohol and<br />\nother problems belie the Georgian simplicity of<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nThe Hopkins life can be a high stress experience,<br />\nwhether in the boardroom, classroom, or on the athletic<br />\nfield. To relieve the tension, or even to keep adrenaline<br />\nflowing during exam periods, some members of the community turn to drugs as possible solutions to their problems. Conventional wisdom often fails to recognize that<br />\nsubstances as undramatic as alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine<br />\ncan ravage the body just as marijuana and other hard drugs<br />\ndo.<br />\nHopkins, like many other university and college campuses across the nation, is beginning to seriously address<br />\nthe potentially serious problems posed by substance abuse.<br />\nThe Faculty and Staff Assistance Program and the JHU<br />\nSubstance Abuse Prevention Program have teamed up to<br />\ncreate a Wellness Program for the Hopkins Community.<br />\nIn a series of Learn at Lunch, brown bag seminars to be<br />\nheld throughout the year, the Program will stress not only education, but prevention of many problems that are<br />\nfaced by all of Homewood.<br />\nAlthough the first such meeting, held on September 26,<br />\naddressed the issue of alcoholism and its possible genetic<br />\ninfluences, substance abuse represents only one of the Programs many concerns.

While I cannot address<br />\nthe issue of sexism represented in<br />\nthe murals, I can state why the<br />\npaintings exist and why they are<br />\nlocated on this campus.<br />\nUpon his death in 1939, Alfred<br />\nJenkins Shriver, a Hopkins alumnus from the Class of 1881 who<br />\nbecame a prominent legal expert,<br />\nleft the bulk of his estate to The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University for the<br />\nconstruction of a lecture hall. The<br />\nbequest was made contingent,<br />\nhowever, upon the Board of<br />\nTrustees agreeing to have eight<br />\nmurals placed in conspicuous<br />\nareas of the building. Had the<br />\nTrustees not agreed to these<br />\nterms, the bequest would have<br />\nbeen withdrawn and offered to<br />\nLoyola College and Goucher College, respectively, subject to the<br />\nsame conditions.<br />\nThe Hopkins Trustees accepted<br />\nShriver's bequest within the<br />\n<br />\nspecified time frame. Due to the<br />\nSecond World War, planning for<br />\nthe new building was delayed.<br />\nWhen Shriver Hall was finally<br />\ncompleted in 1954, artists were<br />\ncommissioned to paint the<br />\nmurals, and the last of the paintings was done by 1956.<br />\nShriver dictated the subjects<br />\nand content of all eight murals.<br />\nOne of the murals, known as the<br />\n\"Famous<br />\nof<br />\nBeauties<br />\nBaltimore\", represented the ten<br />\nmost beautiful women of<br />\nShriver's era (in his estimation).<br />\nThis mural caused a storm of controversy when Shriver's will was<br />\npublished; several of the women<br />\nto be portrayed were initially opposed to the idea. Two of the<br />\nother murals depict the original<br />\nfaculties of philosophy (arts and<br />\nsciences) and medicine. These<br />\npaintings portray only men<br />\nbecause the faculties of both institutions were entirely male.<br />\nThus, while we may debate the<br />\nsuitability of these paintings for<br />\nthe Hopkins campus, their<br />\npresence and content were dictated by the terms of Shriver's<br />\nwill, terms that would<br />\npresumably prevent the removal<br />\nof the paintings.<br />\nJames Stimpert<br />\nAssistant Archivist<br />\n<br />\nShriver H<br />\nTo the Editors<br />\nMiss Laura T.

Fraternity parties are a favorite exchange<br />\npoint, whether the fraternity as a whole knows<br />\nabout it or not. Frequently, deals will be made<br />\nin upstairs rooms, away from prying eyes,<br />\nalthough deals made openly are not uncommon.<br />\nOften, one can even arrange a deal by simply asking around at such parties.<br />\nThe drug connection can also be made outside<br />\nof the parties. The most common advertisement<br />\nfor making such a contact is the \"Grateful Dead<br />\nconversation.\" One student related how such an<br />\narrangement usually works.<br />\n\"One guy will be wearing a Dead t-shirt. The<br />\nother guy asks him if he's ever been to a concert.<br />\nIf the first guy has, chances are that he's connected<br />\nbecause almost nobody goes to a show and doesn't<br />\nget high.\"<br />\nIllicit drugs used at Hopkins range from pot to<br />\ncocaine to LSD. Drug-connected students report<br />\nlittle or no crack use on campus. Officer Reiss<br />\nconfirms that, \"The crack wave hasn't really hit<br />\nBaltimore yet.\"<br />\nAccording to John, \"The distribution of crack<br />\nusually needs a house to sell from; most students<br />\ndon't know of a house in the area.\"<br />\nOther drugs used on campus include speed, laced marijuana, and crystal meth (commonly referred to as \"ice\"), but the use of these are not as<br />\nprevalent as the others. Shrooms are also used on<br />\ncampus, but their use is generally limited to within<br />\ncertain circles.<br />\nEstimates of the drug-using population on campus range from one quarter to one half of the student body. Most of these are people who might<br />\nuse drugs once to experiment or who will only<br />\noccasionally get high. John guesses that about<br />\ntwenty percent of the students who use drugs are<br />\nserious addicts who use drugs frequently.<br />\nTrish Martin, the Coordinator of the Substance<br />\nAbuse Prevention Program at Johns Hopkins, says<br />\nthat getting accurate figures is difficult. \"We get<br />\nlow numbers from our surveys because people<br />\neither don't turn them in or are afraid to admit<br />\nthe extent of their problem.\"<br />\nThe Substance Abuse Program's numbers are<br />\nsimilar, citing reported marijuana use at Hopkins<br />\nat about 33 percent (compared to 44 percent in<br />\na nation-wide poll of college students), cocaine<br />\nuse at 4.5 percent, and heroin use at .6 percent.<br />\nScott Holupka, assistant to Ms. Martin, says,<br />\n\"Marijuana is the most frequently used illegal<br />\ndrug,\" and estimates that the percentage of drug<br />\nuse is closer to 35-40 percent.<br />\nThe Substance Abuse Prevention Program is<br />\nmainly geared towards alcohol abuse, seen as the<br />\nmajor problem among students. Martin and<br />\nHolupka hope that programs dealing with the<br />\nabuse of other drugs will overlap with those dealing with alcohol.<br />\n\"We're trying to think more about why people<br />\nare doing it,\" says Holupka. \"The impression that<br />\npeople get is that of nice, white-laced kids who<br />\nget completely messed up, but some segment must<br />\nget it from somewhere else. Where does the problem start - here or at home?\"<br />\nDrug users often begin innocently. They are<br />\n<br />\nMaybe it's you this article is about.<br />\nMaybe it's you, holding this newspaper, with<br />\nyour hand shaking after two No-Doz and a chaser<br />\nof black coffee. Maybe it's you who got so trashed last weekend that you made out with the wall.<br />\nPerhaps it was you who has a fuzzy blur in your<br />\nmemory where Saturday night is supposed to be,<br />\nwhen you woke up Sunday morning in somebody<br />\nelse's coat closet.<br />\nOr maybe you ended up in Intensive Care at the<br />\nlocal hospital hooked up to a ventilator.<br />\nDrug abuse can take many names and many<br />\nforms. On this campus, and on the campuses of<br />\nthe vast majority of the nation's universities,<br />\nalcohol is by far the drug of choice. And accordingly, most of the physical accidents which have<br />\noccurred on campuses have been the result of its<br />\nabuse.<br />\nAbuse, says Addiction Counselor Paul Geckle,<br />\nis use of any drug that causes a problem of any<br />\nsort\u2014emotional, physical, academic, behavioral,<br />\nor relational.<br />\n\"The division between 'hard-drugs' and 'softdrugs' is artificial,\" he says,\"and reinforces<br />\ndenial of a problem. Abuse, simply put, is abuse.\"<br />\nThe first step to avoiding abuse and its negative<br />\nresults for the individual is understanding the drug.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Godenne, Director of the White<br />\nHouse, alcohol is a misleading drug and a<br />\nmisunderstood one, which makes its abuse particularly tragic.<br />\nFirst and foremost, she says, it is a depressive<br />\ndrug. This in itself is not obvious, since most<br />\nstudents use alcohol in order to lower their social<br />\ninhibitions, which makes them friendlier and more<br />\noutgoing. This effect does result from alcohol use,<br />\nbut only for a brief period, after which depressive<br />\nreactions are felt.<br />\nThe user may feel sadder and lonelier than he<br />\nor she felt initially, but what is most dangerous<br />\nis that the connection between the depression and<br />\nthe drinking is not made. They may feel the<br />\ndepression is due to even greater inadequacy and<br />\nisolation. To compensate for the increased depression, the user may turn to intensified drinking, in<br />\na continuing snowball effect.<br />\nThe realistic consequences of drinking may add<br />\nto depression.<br />\n\"The inhibitions you are lowering might just<br />\nbe important to have around,\" says Godenne,\"if<br />\nyou feel like beating someone up or breaking<br />\nsomething.\"<br />\nWhen the drunken user acts on instinct, and ends<br />\nup fighting, destroying property, or totaling a car,<br />\nthe realization of what they have done may contribute greatly to the cycle of depression. It is a<br />\ndepressing fact as well that children of alcoholics<br />\nhave four times the average incidence of<br />\nalcoholism: 40 percent of them will be alcoholics<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nAddiction begins when the user becomes<br />\nphysically and psychologically dependent on the<br />\ndrug. According to Trish Martin, Coordinator of<br />\nthe Substance Abuse Prevention Program on campus, \"People know the consequences of addiction<br />\nacademically, but are unable to personalize their<br />\nawareness until the problem hits close to home.<br />\nThe illusion breaks when either themselves or a<br />\nloved one is involved.\"<br />\nVery often students have a distorted idea of what<br />\nconstitutes an addiction to alcohol, says<br />\n<br />\nSee DRUGS, 9<br />\n<br />\nI haven't seen much here, except<br />\nfor a lot of drinking. . . but at fraternity parties I do see people smoking<br />\nmarijuana.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014Adrian Velthuis<br />\n<br />\nFocus on Drugs<br />\nSubstance abuse in the Homewood community<br />\nAs more and more people become aware of the existence, prevalence<br />\nand effects of illegal drugs, they discover how little they actually know<br />\nfor certain about the subject.

What makes addictions<br />\ndifferent from other diseases is<br />\nthat they are diseases that tell you<br />\nyou don't have them.

Most dealers will only<br />\nhave a stash for a limited time,<br />\nand when they sell out, distribution goes to another student. This<br />\nrevolving dealership makes it<br />\nharder to track down a source at<br />\nany given time. When a dealer<br />\nhas a product, he is said to be<br />\n\"handling\" or \"holding.\" With<br />\nthis jargon, those who want to<br />\nknow can find out who is currently selling without actually mentioning the product. Jane could be<br />\n\"handling\" one week, and John<br />\ncould \"have the bags\" the next.<br />\nMost dealers buy pot in quarter<br />\nto half pound amounts and sell it<br />\nin quarter ounce bags. They buy<br />\ncocaine in an amount known as<br />\nan eight-ball and sell it by the half<br />\ngram. A quarter ounce of marijuana rims anywhere from $40 to<br />\n$45 usually, with Jamaicangrown at around $55 and some<br />\nblends as high as $70.<br />\nShrooms, sold in the same<br />\nquantities as pot, run about $5<br />\nhigher. John told a story of a<br />\ndealer several years ago who sold<br />\nhis batch for $35 and glutted the<br />\nHopkins market. He sold out<br />\nwithin a day.<br />\nOnce initially started, dealers<br />\nare able to finance themselves.<br />\nWhat usually happens, according<br />\nto John, is that the dealing<br />\nstudents begin with a sum of<br />\nmoney, like $1000, from their<br />\nparents. They initially invest this<br />\ninto their first shipment buy.<br />\nAfterwards, the profits they<br />\ngenerate allow them to cover their<br />\noperating costs, as well as to support their own drug habit.<br />\nDealers get their shipments<br />\nfrom major local sources who<br />\nhandle many other dealers. Major shipments of marijuana are<br />\nsaid to come from College Park.<br />\nThe drug is air-dropped in the<br />\nCollege Park area once a week<br />\nand distributed to most of the major colleges in the Baltimore<br />\nregion. Dealers are able to order<br />\npot by the pound, the price running between $1200 and $1600.<br />\nThe dealers themselves maintain their own security by knowing each customer personally.<br />\nThis makes it difficult to infiltrate<br />\nthe drug circle on campus.<br />\nPerhaps the only way for a bust<br />\nto be made is if an informant<br />\nreveals the dealer's identity.<br />\nSome students grow their own<br />\nmarijuana, but this is usually not<br />\nfor major distribution. \"Some,\"<br />\nsays John, \"grow it to use for<br />\npersonal consumption, others just<br />\n<br />\nBetween Roland Ave. & N.

Dr. Godenne estimates<br />\nthat approximately 20 percent of<br />\nthe students seen use drugs, 30-35<br />\npercent if alcohol is included in<br />\nthose figures.<br />\nAccording to Godenne, the<br />\nnumber of marijuana and cocaine<br />\ncases are about equal. Other<br />\ndrugs do not seem to be as much<br />\nof a problem. \"We're seeing<br />\nfewer psychedelic drugs than we<br />\nhave in the past.\"<br />\nDr. Godenne encourages<br />\nstudents who think they may have<br />\na problem to come in. \"Most<br />\npeople won't come in of their free<br />\nwill, but everything here is completely confidential and they really have nothing to fear.\"<br />\nThe counselors try to deal with<br />\nthe reasons abuse starts in the first<br />\n<br />\nplace - depression or anxiety to<br />\nname a few - and refer the patient<br />\nto the resident drug abuse<br />\ncounselor, Dr. Paul Geckle, for<br />\nthe actual addiction.\"I am also a<br />\nfirm believer in the anonymous<br />\norganizations, such as Alcoholics<br />\nAnonymous or Narcotics<br />\nAnonymous,\"<br />\nDr.<br />\nsays<br />\nGodenne.<br />\nJohn thinks that the best way to<br />\ndeal with the drug problem is to<br />\nspread the knowledge of what<br />\ntheir effects might be on one's life<br />\nas a whole.<br />\n\"Clamping down is not the<br />\nanswer.

The story of Pete<br />\nBravado, told in Susan Fromberg Schaeffer's<br />\n\"Buffalo Afternoon,\" is a classic Vietnam story,<br />\ntold in a style that asks more of the reader than<br />\nautomatic disgust at the wastes of war. As Pete's<br />\nlife unfolds in the novel, Schaeffer wraps it around<br />\nthe reader, engulfing him or her in Pete's psyche.<br />\nBy the time \"Buffalo Afternoon\" is hit with the<br />\nemotional onslaught of Vietnam, the reader's investment in Pete is total and unconscious.<br />\n\"Buffalo Afternoon\" benefits from Schaeffer's<br />\neven hand as a novelist. For though the novel is<br />\nclose, and even intimate with its characters,<br />\nSchaeffer chooses no side and takes no stands. Indeed, it isn't until late in the novel that any sort<br />\nof political agenda appears, at which point the<br />\nreader has already drawn his or her own conclusions. Vietnam becomes an issue through Pete,<br />\nnot through any intrinsic political or social weight.<br />\nClearly, for Schaeffer the point is personal, and<br />\nevery aspect of the Vietnam Experience is<br />\nmagnified\u2014if occasionally distorted\u2014as a result.<br />\nPete is a sensitive and inescapably complicated<br />\nman, someone who has been created, destroyed,<br />\nand resurrected in his attempts to fit into society.<br />\nHis ambivalence toward the social and political<br />\nimport of his duty in Vietnam makes his story a<br />\ndifficult one to render. But Schaeffer's intricate<br />\nnarrative layers, which constantly alter the psychic<br />\ndistance between Pete and the reader, give her a<br />\nwide range of colors with which to paint Pete for<br />\nthe reader. The structure of the novel itself, which<br />\nis less regimented, allows her to wade through<br />\nethnic, social, psychological, and spiritual idioms<br />\nwithout tripping up the feel of the story.<br />\nThe first portion of \"Buffalo Afternoon\" charts<br />\nthe immigration to America of the Bravado family, sketching Pete's family life and his development as a child. Schaeffer packs an amazing<br />\nnumber of years and people into these pages, as<br />\nshe conveys the intricate relationships within<br />\nPete's extended\u2014and extensive\u2014Italian family.<br />\nFrom Pete's brief, intense connection with his<br />\ngrandfather to his caring, but tentative relationships with the women in his family, Schaeffer captures nicely the social and psychological oddities<br />\nof the Bravados. Her characters have roots in corn-<br />\n<br />\nmon stereotypes, but they refuse to lock neatly<br />\ninto them.<br />\nPete Bravado's biggest problem is his father.<br />\nGeorge Bravado does not understand his son, and<br />\n(as with everything he cannot fathom), he tries<br />\nto place Pete under the umbrella of his experience.<br />\nGeorge makes it difficult for Pete to study, even<br />\nto stay in school, and he constantly berates Pete's<br />\nhumanist values. Adolescent Pete deals with this<br />\nsuppression by reflecting it inward: \"[Pete] had<br />\nlearned long ago it was best not to say too much.<br />\nIf you kept quiet, no one could run into the kitchen and make fun of what you just said. According to his father, everything he said was stupid<br />\nor crazy.\" George's effect on Pete, whose sensitivity makes him an easy target, is tangible and<br />\ndefinite. His influence eats away at Pete.<br />\nthroughout the novel, pinning him down and overshadowing over his personality.<br />\nDespite overt attempts to save Pete by his<br />\nmother and grandmother\u2014they don't have the<br />\nstrength to pull him from George's chokehold\u2014<br />\nPete turns his virtues on himself.

Schaeffer's rich, complex<br />\npresentation of the situation confounds the first<br />\npart of the novel and disjoints it at times. But often<br />\nshe cuts right to .its center, leaving no doubt as<br />\nto her characters' motivations.<br />\nUnable to resolve his anger at his father, Pete<br />\ndecides to escape. With his mother's reluctant<br />\nconsent, he enters the Army at seventeen and is<br />\nimmediately sent to Vietnam. Instantly Schaeffer's<br />\nstrength as a novelist becomes apparent: the middle portion of the novel, dealing with Vietnam and<br />\nPete's experience there, is explicit and compelling.<br />\nSchaeffer does not try to recreate the War or<br />\nuse its grotesque aspects to add to her narrative.<br />\nInstead, she records the emotional experience of<br />\n<br />\nThe Freshman One-Acts<br />\nPromising Freshman Talent Performs \"The Patient,\"<br />\n\"A Dopey Fairy Tale,\"\"Am I Blue?\"and \"The Best<br />\nLittle Whorehouse in Texas\"<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nThe Freshman One-Acts, performed in the<br />\nArellano Theatre from October 1-3, can't be<br />\nmeasured entirely by quality. Enthusiasm and<br />\npotential are what count here, and many of the<br />\nperformers in the four short plays overflowed with it. Energy hid the weaknesses, and<br />\nallowed for odd flashes of talent to peek through<br />\noccasionally.<br />\nIn the One-Acts, a series of three short plays<br />\nand one short musical, dialogue and song erupt<br />\nfrom the actors witftsuch rapidity and projection<br />\nthat even the most sluggish of plots could become<br />\ndifficult to follow. And predictably, as the material<br />\nslowed to accomodate the subtleties of more<br />\nseasoned performers, many just ran out of gas.<br />\nThe first play was Agatha Christie's \"The Patient.\" It's a routine whodunit, one that Christie<br />\nprobably could have doodled on a cocktail napkin.<br />\nA critically ill (and very rich) woman has been<br />\npushed from the balcony of her room, and the stoic<br />\nInspector Cray (Darlene Lee) must sniff out the<br />\nmurderer.<br />\nThe casting here, as throughout the One-Acts,<br />\nis good. Everyone seems quite at ease and well<br />\nstudied in their parts; we never wonder if a certain actor would have been better placed in a different piece. In \"The Patient,\" the character<br />\nstrokes are quite broad, and everyone has lots of<br />\nroom for interpretation. The cast performed best<br />\nwhen on stage together, revealing in their<br />\nrecriminations and bitterness towards each other.<br />\nThe play bogs down when Inspector Cray begins<br />\nto interview suspects individually, as her solemnity becomes a bit too weighty.<br />\nAs Cray, Lee takes some getting used to, but<br />\nher straightforward nature, oddly comical<br />\ndelivery, and ubiquitous yellow legal pad are a<br />\ndelight to watch. Michael Gibson plays the<br />\n<br />\nphilandering husband, Bryan Wingfield, with an<br />\nearnestness and measure that is compelling. As<br />\nhis misanthropic sister-in-law, Emmeline Ross,<br />\nSigne Redfield also shows promise and theatrical<br />\nmaturity with her icy delivery and propriety.<br />\nOne of the flaws with \"The Patient\" is that the<br />\nplay is somewhat bleak and requires restraint from<br />\nthe performers. \"A Dopey Fairy Tale,\" on the<br />\nother hand, is a freewheeling romp of idiocy<br />\nsprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. \"Dopey\"<br />\ncombines and twists a thousand standard fairy tale<br />\narchetypes: the baker and his wife, enchanted<br />\nfrogs, weeping princesses, and happy endings.<br />\nIt's a derivative story, but again the enthusiasm<br />\nof the performers rubs off on us and we get caught<br />\nup in the action, however stupid. Smile (David<br />\nKuhn), a schizophrenic mixture of narrators,<br />\nguides us through the tale. It doesn't really need<br />\nhis guidance, but it's part of the fun, and Smile\u2014<br />\npart Ed Grimley, part Rod Sterling\u2014is hilarious.<br />\nAs the Bakers' son Clarence, Dave Edelman<br />\ntakes his part and runs with it. Clarence can imitate anyone, and Edelman plunges into the role<br />\nwith innate ability. If the material weren't so<br />\nchildish, you might think you were witnessing<br />\nJohn Belushi doing stand-up. As Chatter, the family pooch, Ryan Whiteman's part sounds harder<br />\nthan it is. Whiteman has the physical aspects of<br />\nthe part down, but on occasion he gets a bit too<br />\nsmirky, and you want to box his ears.<br />\nEveryone in \"The Dopey Fairy Tale\" attacks<br />\nthe campy material with fervor, but too often the<br />\nactors revolve within themselves, stepping on each<br />\nother's lines\u2014not out of egotism, but from sheer<br />\nimpatience. Smile's interjections attempt to<br />\nminimize this, but it becomes irritating<br />\nnonetheless.<br />\nThe material for the latter half of the One-Acts<br />\nSee ONE-ACTS, 11<br />\n<br />\nSusan Fromberg Schaeffer\u2014her novel \"Buffalo Afternoon\" is built around an evenhanded narrative that<br />\nemphasizes the voice of her protagonist, not her politics<br />\n<br />\nthe soldiers in Vietnam, with Pete Bravado as her<br />\nlens. The War's physical realities resonate in<br />\nPete, whose emotions the reader can gauge at<br />\nthis point. Schaeffer avoids hyperbole in describing the War by assuming an admirably evenhanded, distant position in the narrative: she lets Pete<br />\ndo the talking, so to speak, and the psychological<br />\npower of the effect is impressive.<br />\nUpon Pete's return from Vietnam, \"Buffalo<br />\nAfternoon\" lapses into a convoluted and<br />\nsomewhat sluggish account of Pete's experiences<br />\nas a \"typical\" veteran. Persecuted by society and<br />\ntortured by the unresolved violence within him,<br />\nhe indeed seems archetypal. But Schaeffer<br />\nmanages to enrich this otherwise familiar tale by<br />\n<br />\nThough Schaeffer's rich<br />\nnarrative often confounds<br />\nthe reader, it can cut right to<br />\nthe emotional center of a scene.<br />\ndelineating further the character the reader already<br />\nknows so well. As a result, the marriage, divorce,<br />\nviolence, and depression that riddle Pete's life after<br />\nservice take on new dimensions. Unfortunately,<br />\nSchaeffer leaves too much of this territory uncharted; she becomes lazy in examining<br />\nPete's thoughts and motives.<br />\nSeveral chapters in \"Buffalo Afternoon\" are<br />\nconfusing and unclear; they represent Schaeffer's<br />\n<br />\nweakest moments. As a thread through the novel<br />\nshe includes a \"second voice,\" the narrative of<br />\na Vietnamese woman whose overall role in the<br />\nnovel is never clear. Although my curiosity about<br />\nthis character was acute at first, Schaeffer never<br />\ncompleted the connection between her and Pete<br />\nBravado, leaving the novel with an uncomfortable<br />\nstructural hole. Like several other extraneous<br />\nelements in \"Buffalo Afternoon,\" this voice<br />\nproves too much for the novelist to support.<br />\nStill, these flaws are minor distractions. Despite<br />\nits rambling final section, the strength of Pete<br />\nBravado rings throughout \"Buffalo Afternoon.\"<br />\nThough beleaguered by his past, and ostensibly<br />\nwithout recourse, Pete doesn't reject his history.<br />\nInstead, he transcends it and pulls his haggard self<br />\nin a new direction, undaunted by the future's<br />\ngloomy prospects.<br />\n\"Buffalo Afternoon,\" by Susan Fromberg Schaeffer, published by Alfred A.

Human<br />\nbeings have dermatoglyphics on the fingers, palms, toes, and soles.<br />\nIn the third to fourth month of gestation, the texture of fetal skin<br />\nchanges from smooth to ridged. The lower of the two layers of skin,<br />\nthe dermis, acquires multiple closely-spaced little peaks. The upper<br />\nlayer of skin, the epidermis, grows out of the dermis and adopts a<br />\nmodified version of its texture--ridges following the pattern of the<br />\npeaks.<br />\nSince the texture of the epidermis is determined by the dermis,<br />\nthe only way to erase fingerprints is to destroy the dermis. John Dillinger, notorious gangster, doused his fingers with acid to get rid of<br />\nhis prints, forgetting that his palms also had dermatoglyphics.<br />\nNobody, not even identical twins, could possibly have the same<br />\ndermatoglyphics. The general pattern of dermal peaks is inherited,<br />\nbut their exact positions are random. The chances of two people having<br />\nidentical dermatoglyphics are on the order of one in ten to the fortythird power.<br />\n<br />\nFootprints and Promiscuity<br />\nState of the art chemistry<br />\nby Sharyn Horowitz<br />\nThe Fenton reaction, a reaction<br />\nof iron and hydrogen peroxide<br />\nthat produces hydroxyl radicals,<br />\nwas developed in the 1890's by<br />\nFenton. Today, this simple reaction is helping Dr. Thomas<br />\nTullius of the Chemistry department develop chemical pictures<br />\nof DNA and its associated<br />\nproteins.<br />\nInside cell nuclei, DNA's<br />\nstructure is more complicated<br />\nthan a simple chain of<br />\nnucleotides. It is so long that to<br />\nfit inside the cell, it must be wrapped up tightly. Before the genetic<br />\ninformation on it can be read, the<br />\nDNA must be unwrapped. After<br />\nthe genetic code has been<br />\ntranslated into a heart, eyeball, or<br />\nfinger, the DNA has to be rewrapped lest the body grow too<br />\nmany of anything. The timing of<br />\nunwrapping and re-wrapping of<br />\nDNA is thus critical to development. Proteins control the wrapping and unwrapping of the<br />\nDNA,so scientists are anxious to<br />\ndiscover how DNA-protein complexes work.<br />\nThe hydroxyl radical cuts between the nucleotides of DNA<br />\nmolecules. Tullius first labels<br />\nnucleotides of his chosen DNA,<br />\nand subjects it to the Fenton reaction. By limiting the reaction<br />\ntime, Tullius can generally limit<br />\n<br />\nthe hydroxyl radical to cleaving<br />\njust one bond on every DNA<br />\nmolecule. He extracts the labeled DNA fragments, and throws<br />\nthe rest of the DNA out. Using<br />\ngel electrophoresis, which<br />\nseparates molecules by size, he<br />\nfinds out where the hydroxyl<br />\ncleaved the DNA. On naked<br />\nDNA, the hydroxyl can cleave<br />\nevery bond, producing a continuous pattern of evenly spaced<br />\ndots on the gel.<br />\nWhen DNA-protein complexes<br />\nare subjected to the hydroxyl<br />\nradicals, the pattern of dots on the<br />\ngel is discontinuous. It has<br />\ndistinct gaps\u2014footprints. DNA<br />\nclinging to a protein is known to<br />\nbe invulnerable to several DNA<br />\ncutting chemicals. Apparently,<br />\nproteins also protect DNA from<br />\nthe hydroxyl radical. When the<br />\npattern of dots shows a footprint<br />\nbetween the sixty-three base pair<br />\nfragment and the forty-one base<br />\npair fragment, a protein is bound<br />\nto base pairs forty-two through<br />\nsixty-two.

For six months,<br />\nthe Orioles provided the<br />\nBaltimore area with a thrilling<br />\nsuccess story, and an excitement<br />\nwhich had been forgotten during<br />\nfive years of futility.

True,<br />\n\"worst to second\" lacks a certain<br />\npoetic appeal, but . . .<br />\nIn the 70's and early 80's, the<br />\nOrioles were as consistent as any<br />\nteam in baseball. Every season<br />\nwas a winning season, and involvement in the pennant race<br />\nwas virtually annual.<br />\nBrooks Robinson, Mark<br />\nBelanger, Bobby Grich, Rich<br />\nDauer, Eddie Murray, and Cal<br />\nRipken highlighted infields that<br />\nappeared almost impenetrable.<br />\nBehind them Paul Blair, Al Bumbry, Ken Singleton, and others<br />\ndazzled in the outfield.<br />\nThe pitching staff, containing<br />\nthe likes of Jim Palmer, Dave<br />\nMcNally, Mike Cuellar, Scott<br />\nMcGregor, Mike Flanagan, Steve<br />\nStone, Tippy Martinez, Storm<br />\nDavis, and Mike Boddicker, was<br />\nconsistently outstanding.<br />\nOffensively, although rarely as<br />\npotent, the Birds were equally exciting. Relying heavily upon<br />\nmanager Earl Weaver's favorite<br />\nstrategy, Dr. Longball, particularly in the form of a threerun shot, Brooks, Murray, Lee<br />\nMay, and Boog Powell provided<br />\nnumerous memories and more<br />\nruns.<br />\n<br />\nThe O's were a welldisciplined team that emphasized<br />\nfundamentals and did not make<br />\nmental errors. They executed<br />\ncutoffs and relays properly. They<br />\nbacked up plays. Their pitchers<br />\nknew when to cover first base and<br />\nremembered to. The Orioles<br />\ndid not beat themselves.<br />\nThe formula was simple: good<br />\npitching, strong defense, fundamentals, power equals success.<br />\nCertain years, 1979 and 1983<br />\nin particular, the Birds possessed a certain magical aura. There<br />\nwas an inescapable feeling that on<br />\nany given night, something<br />\nremarkable would happen. Ninthinning heroics were commonplace. Unknown farmhands<br />\npitching shutouts or slapping<br />\ncrucial basehits was not startling.<br />\nThe O's advertised, \"Every night<br />\nit's a different star:\" and they<br />\nwere right. \"Oriole Magic\" was<br />\nmore than a slogan.<br />\nThen after the 1983 World<br />\nSeries celebration, the magic<br />\ndissipated. The Orioles became a<br />\nmiddle-of-the-pack organization,<br />\nthen descended to a losing team,<br />\nand finally hit the depths of<br />\nhumiliation in 1988. Twenty-one<br />\nconsecutive losses, a 54-107<br />\nseason record: the memory<br />\ndisgusts.<br />\nThe Orioles' problems were<br />\nobvious. Too many strong and incompatible personalities caused<br />\nstrife and discontent. A lack of<br />\nquality players in the organization, at both the major and minor<br />\nleague level, did not help either.<br />\nThe Orioles spent enormous<br />\namounts of money on aging stars,<br />\nwhich did as much good for the<br />\nBirds as it has done for Mr. Steinbrenner in this decade.

Even in our own<br />\nbackyard, there is hardly a time<br />\nwhen you won't find Hopkins<br />\nstudents running the track or doing a Charles Village circuit.<br />\nWhile you'll certainly see people<br />\nof every shape and size running<br />\nor jogging in different ways,<br />\nthere are a few basics that the<br />\nfitness-conscious runner should<br />\nconsider before embarking on a<br />\ntraining program.<br />\nFirst, there is a real difference<br />\nbetween running and jogging.<br />\nNot only in speed, but in frame<br />\nof mind as well. The typical jogger will jog for health benefits<br />\nand not for any real \"addletion\"to jogging. The serious runner, on the other hand, might<br />\nconsider running even if he<br />\nthought it had no positive fitness<br />\nresults.<br />\nThe more important difference,<br />\nthough, is in the speed and impact of training. For a fitness program to be aerobically sound, the<br />\nheart rate must be increased by<br />\na certain amount. Gabe Mirkin,<br />\nexpert in sports medicine at the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, writes,<br />\n\"To get maximum benefit, you<br />\nmust run hard enough to raise<br />\nyour pulse to 120 beats per<br />\nminute two to three times per<br />\nweek.\" Jogging, while it may<br />\nhelp tone muscle and improve<br />\noverall health, is not as sound<br />\naerobically. It is important to note<br />\nthat, for some, hard running can<br />\nbe dangerous. According to Dr.<br />\nMirkin, people who are over thirty, or fear risk of heart attack in<br />\nduced by exercise, should have a<br />\nstress electrocardiogram done.<br />\nSecond, wearing proper clothes<br />\nand shoes are key factors to<br />\navoiding injury. Good running<br />\nshoes should be measured not only in terms of length, but also in<br />\nwidth. If you are not the usual D<br />\nwidth, do not settle for the usual<br />\nshoe. Find a store that carries<br />\nrunning sneakers in different<br />\nwidths. A good running shoe has<br />\nattributes that will limit pronation, including arch-supports, a<br />\nflexible sole, and a wide heel.<br />\nAlong with good shoes, wear thin<br />\nsocks. Thick socks, while they<br />\nmight reduce stress from running,<br />\nalso prevent the shoe from reducing pronation, which commonly<br />\nleads to injury.<br />\n- Third, ease into a running program slowly and build up over the<br />\ncourse of a few weeks. Once you<br />\nbegin a running program, do not<br />\npractice the same circuit and the<br />\nsame distance each day-this can<br />\nbe tedious, put too much stress on<br />\na single muscle group, and make<br />\n<br />\nSoccer shoots down Bears<br />\n<br />\nit more difficult to run farther in<br />\nthe future.<br />\nProper form for running means<br />\nthat as your feet come down, you<br />\nland on your heels not your toes.<br />\nDo not lean forward, as is the<br />\nnatural tendency. Instead, keep<br />\nyou back straight. For the most<br />\npart, you arms should be relaxed and your hand loosely closed.<br />\nLastly, when planning a running regimen, plan wisely. Limit<br />\nyour hard runs to three times a<br />\nweek (not on consecutive days),<br />\nand stretch before-and after every<br />\nrun. Running hard more then<br />\nthree times weekly will not improve your cardiovascular health<br />\nand might lead to exhaustion or<br />\nstress-related injury. Even in hard<br />\nruns, you should not push<br />\nyourself to unsafe levels. While<br />\nbreathing deeply can be expected,<br />\nhaving to gasp for air means that<br />\nyou have pushed yourself to a<br />\ndangerous extreme. Be careful to<br />\nknow when you have worked you<br />\nbody past safe levels. Also, as<br />\nyou conclude a run, never stop<br />\nmotion immediately. Slow your<br />\npace to a jog and ease your pulse<br />\nrate down. Sudden stops of all activity can be harmful to your<br />\nheart.<br />\nTo prevent running injury, the<br />\nbest advice is to pay attention to<br />\nthe warning signs of your body.<br />\nDo not run if your legs feel stressed and heavy-that is sometimes<br />\na signal that they are still healing<br />\nfrom the last run. The same is<br />\ntrue of other injuries. It is a common myth that you can \"run<br />\nthrough\" an injury, causing it to<br />\ndisappear. While some of us may<br />\nhave had the experience of running until a cramp goes away, this<br />\nis not generally good practice.<br />\nTrying to \"run through\" an injury will cause the condition to<br />\nget worse or create new injuries.<br />\nOn the nutrition front, there is<br />\nenough information for a series<br />\nof columns. One of the most important dietary rules, though<br />\nspecifically for women who run,<br />\nwas suggested by Robert Haas in<br />\nEat to Win. He believes that<br />\nwomen who run should be<br />\nespecially concious of their iron<br />\nlevels. They may not need iron<br />\nsupplements to run, but they<br />\nshould be sure to get enough in<br />\ntheir normal diets. Usually, a<br />\nwoman can maintain the proper<br />\namounts of iron by eating a few<br />\ncups of legumes each week.<br />\nAs millions of Americans(and<br />\na large group of Hopkins<br />\nstudents) will testify, running can<br />\nbecome a positive addiction. It is<br />\nan exercise that will pay off not<br />\nonly in terms of aerobic and<br />\nmuscular benefits, but will also<br />\nimprove your quality of living.<br />\n<br />\nCLASSIFIEDS<br />\nCollege/Campus Representative:<br />\nEarn top $ Flexible hours, fun, enjoyable, rewarding Gross up to<br />\n$20,000 per year by helping friends<br />\nreceive grants/scholarships For info<br />\nplease call.

This semester<br />\nthe SEA appears to be back in<br />\nforce, with high attendance and<br />\nabundant enthusiasm. According<br />\nto SEA president David Pyles,<br />\napproximately eighty-five people<br />\nregularly attend meetings, a sharp<br />\ncontrast to the fifteen members of<br />\nlast year. That makes the SEA<br />\none of the largest active groups<br />\non campus.<br />\nWhen asked about the<br />\nphenomenal interest in the group,<br />\nPyles said,' The time has come<br />\nwhere environmental problems<br />\nare so intertwined in our lives,<br />\nand so severe, that it's hard not<br />\nto notice and feel that something<br />\nneeds to be done.\"<br />\nLast semester, the group headed a small recycling effort on<br />\ncampus for aluminum cans. It<br />\nalso co-sponsored a vigil in D.C.<br />\nto halt the Altimira Dam Project,<br />\na series of dams on the Amazon<br />\nthat, if completed, would have<br />\nflooded an area approximately the<br />\nsize of Pennsylvania. The group<br />\nalso participated in letter-writing<br />\nactivities and petition circulation.<br />\nThis semester, in addition to<br />\nexpanding and improving the<br />\nrecycling program, one of the<br />\ngroup's main goals is to increase<br />\nawareness of environmental<br />\nissues on campus. The group<br />\nplans to do this through flyers,<br />\nposters, and guest speakers. The<br />\ngroup is also working closely<br />\nwith the Office of the Chaplain on<br />\nplanning Earthweek '90. Pyles<br />\npraised the Chaplain, saying,<br /><br />\n\"She has helped us so much, alternate power sources, and<br />\nthere is a committee being formhelped us get on our feet.\"<br />\nThe SEA is divided into ed to protest the use of styrofoam.<br />\nvarious committees, each of The Animal Rights Committee<br />\nwhich has a special focus.

Although there have been some<br />\nworrisome suggestions of late (such as the proposition to<br />\nmerge the Departments of French and Italian Studies,<br />\nresulting in the former's zealous reservation of airline<br />\ntickets to Emory University), it is heartening to see ongoing commitment to the new Women's Studies program,<br />\nforward steps in such troubled areas as Classics, and a new<br />\ntenured professor in Mathematics.<br />\nUndergraduate life has resumed with a soothing sense<br />\nof business-as-usual. The current freshman class seems to<br />\nhave allayed widespread fears that its increased size would<br />\nyield a bunch of morons.(Indeed, the new group's statistics<br />\nare even more impressive than those of last year's freshman<br />\nclass) The robust condition in which many student groups<br />\nfind themselves\u2014from the News-Letter to The<br />\nBarnstormers\u2014 is also encouraging.<br />\nStill, the absence of acceptable lecture hall space to house<br />\nlarge, freshman -dominated classes such as<br />\nMicroeconomics and Contemporary International Politics<br />\nshould indicate that Homewood cannot suffer another boost<br />\nin enrollment. One hopes this is apparent to administrators<br />\nconcerned by the overburdened faculty.<br />\nStudent Council's persistent contact with Dean of Arts<br />\nand Sciences Lloyd Armstrong has yielded some potentially effective committees to this end, and to the prospect<br />\nthat undergraduate concerns may actually be respected at<br />\nthe administrative level. The short-term monitoring committee and the Five-Year Plan Committee, ostensibly<br />\ncreated as quality-control devices, are particularly encouraging. Maintain hope that the days of the Parking<br />\nCommittee are over.<br />\nAcademics aside, the Student Activities Office is sailing with a full crew this year, notably with its new Student Activities Director, William Smedick. Though former<br />\ndirector Susan Boswell (who has since become Dean of<br />\nStudents) is a hard act to follow, Smedick's amiable style<br />\nand impressive qualifications bode well for coherent student support.<br />\nWe are encouraged, too, by Funk Night's return to the<br />\nGrad Club this fall, particularly in light of its success at<br />\nthe end of last year. The Grad Club's quick start this fall,<br />\nwith good programming and solid crowds, confirms a<br />\nsense that the Hopkins community is significantly more<br />\ninterested in campus life now than in previous years.<br /><br />\nAll of which leaves us feeling better about Hopkins than<br />\nwe did as the year began. It is a credit to the efficacy of<br />\nthe Dormitory Housing, Student Activities, and Academic<br />\nAdvising Offices that the shift to a larger freshman class<br />\nhas been smooth, but burgeoning class sizes are already<br />\nalarming. Broader, pivotal questions as to the direction<br />\nin which the School of Arts and Sciences is headed remain unanswered. But there is dialogue, and we are<br />\nencouraged.<br /><br />\nCoping with abuse<br /><br />\nGoing off to college for the first time opens doors to<br />\nmany new experiences. The tastes of freedom which accompany freshman year are often the first of their kind<br />\nfor students entering Hopkins. Campus life offers new people, places and ideas, many stimulating and imbued with<br />\nthe novelty of making most of one's own decisions. Unfortunately, an equal number of factors can make the college campus less than idyllic; stress, drugs, alcohol and<br />\nother problems belie the Georgian simplicity of<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nThe Hopkins life can be a high stress experience,<br />\nwhether in the boardroom, classroom, or on the athletic<br />\nfield. To relieve the tension, or even to keep adrenaline<br />\nflowing during exam periods, some members of the community turn to drugs as possible solutions to their problems. Conventional wisdom often fails to recognize that<br />\nsubstances as undramatic as alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine<br />\ncan ravage the body just as marijuana and other hard drugs<br />\ndo.<br />\nHopkins, like many other university and college campuses across the nation, is beginning to seriously address<br />\nthe potentially serious problems posed by substance abuse.<br />\nThe Faculty and Staff Assistance Program and the JHU<br />\nSubstance Abuse Prevention Program have teamed up to<br />\ncreate a Wellness Program for the Hopkins Community.<br />\nIn a series of Learn at Lunch, brown bag seminars to be<br />\nheld throughout the year, the Program will stress not only education, but prevention of many problems that are<br />\nfaced by all of Homewood.<br />\nAlthough the first such meeting, held on September 26,<br />\naddressed the issue of alcoholism and its possible genetic<br />\ninfluences, substance abuse represents only one of the Programs many concerns.

While I cannot address<br />\nthe issue of sexism represented in<br />\nthe murals, I can state why the<br />\npaintings exist and why they are<br />\nlocated on this campus.<br />\nUpon his death in 1939, Alfred<br />\nJenkins Shriver, a Hopkins alumnus from the Class of 1881 who<br />\nbecame a prominent legal expert,<br />\nleft the bulk of his estate to The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University for the<br />\nconstruction of a lecture hall. The<br />\nbequest was made contingent,<br />\nhowever, upon the Board of<br />\nTrustees agreeing to have eight<br />\nmurals placed in conspicuous<br />\nareas of the building. Had the<br />\nTrustees not agreed to these<br />\nterms, the bequest would have<br />\nbeen withdrawn and offered to<br />\nLoyola College and Goucher College, respectively, subject to the<br />\nsame conditions.<br />\nThe Hopkins Trustees accepted<br />\nShriver's bequest within the<br /><br />\nspecified time frame. Due to the<br />\nSecond World War, planning for<br />\nthe new building was delayed.<br />\nWhen Shriver Hall was finally<br />\ncompleted in 1954, artists were<br />\ncommissioned to paint the<br />\nmurals, and the last of the paintings was done by 1956.<br />\nShriver dictated the subjects<br />\nand content of all eight murals.<br />\nOne of the murals, known as the<br />\n\"Famous<br />\nof<br />\nBeauties<br />\nBaltimore\", represented the ten<br />\nmost beautiful women of<br />\nShriver's era (in his estimation).<br />\nThis mural caused a storm of controversy when Shriver's will was<br />\npublished; several of the women<br />\nto be portrayed were initially opposed to the idea. Two of the<br />\nother murals depict the original<br />\nfaculties of philosophy (arts and<br />\nsciences) and medicine. These<br />\npaintings portray only men<br />\nbecause the faculties of both institutions were entirely male.<br />\nThus, while we may debate the<br />\nsuitability of these paintings for<br />\nthe Hopkins campus, their<br />\npresence and content were dictated by the terms of Shriver's<br />\nwill, terms that would<br />\npresumably prevent the removal<br />\nof the paintings.<br />\nJames Stimpert<br />\nAssistant Archivist<br /><br />\nShriver H<br />\nTo the Editors<br />\nMiss Laura T. Landman's letter in your Sept. 29 issue calling<br />\nfor the removal of allegedly sexist murals in Shriver Hall provides evidence of serious shortcomings in our freshmen orientation program.

Fraternity parties are a favorite exchange<br />\npoint, whether the fraternity as a whole knows<br />\nabout it or not. Frequently, deals will be made<br />\nin upstairs rooms, away from prying eyes,<br />\nalthough deals made openly are not uncommon.<br />\nOften, one can even arrange a deal by simply asking around at such parties.<br />\nThe drug connection can also be made outside<br />\nof the parties. The most common advertisement<br />\nfor making such a contact is the \"Grateful Dead<br />\nconversation.\" One student related how such an<br />\narrangement usually works.<br />\n\"One guy will be wearing a Dead t-shirt. The<br />\nother guy asks him if he's ever been to a concert.<br />\nIf the first guy has, chances are that he's connected<br />\nbecause almost nobody goes to a show and doesn't<br />\nget high.\"<br />\nIllicit drugs used at Hopkins range from pot to<br />\ncocaine to LSD. Drug-connected students report<br />\nlittle or no crack use on campus. Officer Reiss<br />\nconfirms that, \"The crack wave hasn't really hit<br />\nBaltimore yet.\"<br />\nAccording to John, \"The distribution of crack<br />\nusually needs a house to sell from; most students<br />\ndon't know of a house in the area.\"<br />\nOther drugs used on campus include speed, laced marijuana, and crystal meth (commonly referred to as \"ice\"), but the use of these are not as<br />\nprevalent as the others. Shrooms are also used on<br />\ncampus, but their use is generally limited to within<br />\ncertain circles.<br />\nEstimates of the drug-using population on campus range from one quarter to one half of the student body. Most of these are people who might<br />\nuse drugs once to experiment or who will only<br />\noccasionally get high. John guesses that about<br />\ntwenty percent of the students who use drugs are<br />\nserious addicts who use drugs frequently.<br />\nTrish Martin, the Coordinator of the Substance<br />\nAbuse Prevention Program at Johns Hopkins, says<br />\nthat getting accurate figures is difficult. \"We get<br />\nlow numbers from our surveys because people<br />\neither don't turn them in or are afraid to admit<br />\nthe extent of their problem.\"<br />\nThe Substance Abuse Program's numbers are<br />\nsimilar, citing reported marijuana use at Hopkins<br />\nat about 33 percent (compared to 44 percent in<br />\na nation-wide poll of college students), cocaine<br />\nuse at 4.5 percent, and heroin use at .6 percent.<br />\nScott Holupka, assistant to Ms. Martin, says,<br />\n\"Marijuana is the most frequently used illegal<br />\ndrug,\" and estimates that the percentage of drug<br />\nuse is closer to 35-40 percent.<br />\nThe Substance Abuse Prevention Program is<br />\nmainly geared towards alcohol abuse, seen as the<br />\nmajor problem among students. Martin and<br />\nHolupka hope that programs dealing with the<br />\nabuse of other drugs will overlap with those dealing with alcohol.<br />\n\"We're trying to think more about why people<br />\nare doing it,\" says Holupka. \"The impression that<br />\npeople get is that of nice, white-laced kids who<br />\nget completely messed up, but some segment must<br />\nget it from somewhere else. Where does the problem start - here or at home?\"<br />\nDrug users often begin innocently. They are<br /><br />\nMaybe it's you this article is about.<br />\nMaybe it's you, holding this newspaper, with<br />\nyour hand shaking after two No-Doz and a chaser<br />\nof black coffee. Maybe it's you who got so trashed last weekend that you made out with the wall.<br />\nPerhaps it was you who has a fuzzy blur in your<br />\nmemory where Saturday night is supposed to be,<br />\nwhen you woke up Sunday morning in somebody<br />\nelse's coat closet.<br />\nOr maybe you ended up in Intensive Care at the<br />\nlocal hospital hooked up to a ventilator.<br />\nDrug abuse can take many names and many<br />\nforms. On this campus, and on the campuses of<br />\nthe vast majority of the nation's universities,<br />\nalcohol is by far the drug of choice. And accordingly, most of the physical accidents which have<br />\noccurred on campuses have been the result of its<br />\nabuse.<br />\nAbuse, says Addiction Counselor Paul Geckle,<br />\nis use of any drug that causes a problem of any<br />\nsort\u2014emotional, physical, academic, behavioral,<br />\nor relational.<br />\n\"The division between 'hard-drugs' and 'softdrugs' is artificial,\" he says,\"and reinforces<br />\ndenial of a problem. Abuse, simply put, is abuse.\"<br />\nThe first step to avoiding abuse and its negative<br />\nresults for the individual is understanding the drug.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Godenne, Director of the White<br />\nHouse, alcohol is a misleading drug and a<br />\nmisunderstood one, which makes its abuse particularly tragic.<br />\nFirst and foremost, she says, it is a depressive<br />\ndrug. This in itself is not obvious, since most<br />\nstudents use alcohol in order to lower their social<br />\ninhibitions, which makes them friendlier and more<br />\noutgoing. This effect does result from alcohol use,<br />\nbut only for a brief period, after which depressive<br />\nreactions are felt.<br />\nThe user may feel sadder and lonelier than he<br />\nor she felt initially, but what is most dangerous<br />\nis that the connection between the depression and<br />\nthe drinking is not made. They may feel the<br />\ndepression is due to even greater inadequacy and<br />\nisolation. To compensate for the increased depression, the user may turn to intensified drinking, in<br />\na continuing snowball effect.<br />\nThe realistic consequences of drinking may add<br />\nto depression.<br />\n\"The inhibitions you are lowering might just<br />\nbe important to have around,\" says Godenne,\"if<br />\nyou feel like beating someone up or breaking<br />\nsomething.\"<br />\nWhen the drunken user acts on instinct, and ends<br />\nup fighting, destroying property, or totaling a car,<br />\nthe realization of what they have done may contribute greatly to the cycle of depression. It is a<br />\ndepressing fact as well that children of alcoholics<br />\nhave four times the average incidence of<br />\nalcoholism: 40 percent of them will be alcoholics<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nAddiction begins when the user becomes<br />\nphysically and psychologically dependent on the<br />\ndrug. According to Trish Martin, Coordinator of<br />\nthe Substance Abuse Prevention Program on campus, \"People know the consequences of addiction<br />\nacademically, but are unable to personalize their<br />\nawareness until the problem hits close to home.<br />\nThe illusion breaks when either themselves or a<br />\nloved one is involved.\"<br />\nVery often students have a distorted idea of what<br />\nconstitutes an addiction to alcohol, says<br /><br />\nSee DRUGS, 9<br /><br />\nI haven't seen much here, except<br />\nfor a lot of drinking. . . but at fraternity parties I do see people smoking<br />\nmarijuana.<br /><br />\n\u2014Adrian Velthuis<br /><br />\nFocus on Drugs<br />\nSubstance abuse in the Homewood community<br />\nAs more and more people become aware of the existence, prevalence<br />\nand effects of illegal drugs, they discover how little they actually know<br />\nfor certain about the subject.

It is a fatal and progressive disease that needs treatment, and will not go away on its<br />\nown.<br />\n\"Once past the point of<br />\nalcoholism,\" says Geckle, \"successful drinking is no longer an<br />\noption. What makes addictions<br />\ndifferent from other diseases is<br />\nthat they are diseases that tell you<br />\nyou don't have them. But eventually they'll trip you up.\"<br />\nNevertheless, many people<br />\nhave difficulty seeing alcohol as<br />\na drug substance, while \"harder\"<br />\ndrugs are the danger to be avoided at all costs.<br />\n\"People don't consider alcohol<br />\na drug,\" says Martin, \"because<br />\nthey say, 'It's my drug, so it's<br />\n0.K.\"<br />\n'<br />\nAccording to Martin, society is<br />\nambivalent about alcohol<br />\nbecause, though a drug, its<br />\nresponsible use is a traditional<br />\naspect of society. Ironically,<br />\nabuse of alcohol results in the<br />\ndeaths of more people per year<br />\nthan all other drugs combined,<br />\nseveral times over.<br />\nBut how and why does someone become alcoholic? The<br />\nanswer varies from individual to<br />\nindividual, but it is clear that<br />\nalcoholism and other addictions<br />\nare the symptoms of deeper,<br />\nunderlying problems. Much of it<br />\nstarts in the nation's high schools,<br />\nwhere statistics show that alcohol<br />\nabuse is extensive.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Godenne,<br />\nstress has been linked to abuse,<br />\nwhich may come from the instability of the user's family life<br />\nor other adolescent pressures.<br />\nWhile no one cause can be<br />\nisolated, it is evident that many<br />\nadolescents turn to alcohol for<br />\nanswers.<br />\n\"The person is feeling pain,\"<br />\nsays Martin, \"and one drink<br />\nmakes it feel better.

Most dealers will only<br />\nhave a stash for a limited time,<br />\nand when they sell out, distribution goes to another student. This<br />\nrevolving dealership makes it<br />\nharder to track down a source at<br />\nany given time. When a dealer<br />\nhas a product, he is said to be<br />\n\"handling\" or \"holding.\" With<br />\nthis jargon, those who want to<br />\nknow can find out who is currently selling without actually mentioning the product. Jane could be<br />\n\"handling\" one week, and John<br />\ncould \"have the bags\" the next.<br />\nMost dealers buy pot in quarter<br />\nto half pound amounts and sell it<br />\nin quarter ounce bags. They buy<br />\ncocaine in an amount known as<br />\nan eight-ball and sell it by the half<br />\ngram. A quarter ounce of marijuana rims anywhere from $40 to<br />\n$45 usually, with Jamaicangrown at around $55 and some<br />\nblends as high as $70.<br />\nShrooms, sold in the same<br />\nquantities as pot, run about $5<br />\nhigher. John told a story of a<br />\ndealer several years ago who sold<br />\nhis batch for $35 and glutted the<br />\nHopkins market. He sold out<br />\nwithin a day.<br />\nOnce initially started, dealers<br />\nare able to finance themselves.<br />\nWhat usually happens, according<br />\nto John, is that the dealing<br />\nstudents begin with a sum of<br />\nmoney, like $1000, from their<br />\nparents. They initially invest this<br />\ninto their first shipment buy.<br />\nAfterwards, the profits they<br />\ngenerate allow them to cover their<br />\noperating costs, as well as to support their own drug habit.<br />\nDealers get their shipments<br />\nfrom major local sources who<br />\nhandle many other dealers. Major shipments of marijuana are<br />\nsaid to come from College Park.<br />\nThe drug is air-dropped in the<br />\nCollege Park area once a week<br />\nand distributed to most of the major colleges in the Baltimore<br />\nregion. Dealers are able to order<br />\npot by the pound, the price running between $1200 and $1600.<br />\nThe dealers themselves maintain their own security by knowing each customer personally.<br />\nThis makes it difficult to infiltrate<br />\nthe drug circle on campus.<br />\nPerhaps the only way for a bust<br />\nto be made is if an informant<br />\nreveals the dealer's identity.<br />\nSome students grow their own<br />\nmarijuana, but this is usually not<br />\nfor major distribution. \"Some,\"<br />\nsays John, \"grow it to use for<br />\npersonal consumption, others just<br /><br />\nBetween Roland Ave. &amp; N.

The story of Pete<br />\nBravado, told in Susan Fromberg Schaeffer's<br />\n\"Buffalo Afternoon,\" is a classic Vietnam story,<br />\ntold in a style that asks more of the reader than<br />\nautomatic disgust at the wastes of war. As Pete's<br />\nlife unfolds in the novel, Schaeffer wraps it around<br />\nthe reader, engulfing him or her in Pete's psyche.<br />\nBy the time \"Buffalo Afternoon\" is hit with the<br />\nemotional onslaught of Vietnam, the reader's investment in Pete is total and unconscious.<br />\n\"Buffalo Afternoon\" benefits from Schaeffer's<br />\neven hand as a novelist. For though the novel is<br />\nclose, and even intimate with its characters,<br />\nSchaeffer chooses no side and takes no stands. Indeed, it isn't until late in the novel that any sort<br />\nof political agenda appears, at which point the<br />\nreader has already drawn his or her own conclusions. Vietnam becomes an issue through Pete,<br />\nnot through any intrinsic political or social weight.<br />\nClearly, for Schaeffer the point is personal, and<br />\nevery aspect of the Vietnam Experience is<br />\nmagnified\u2014if occasionally distorted\u2014as a result.<br />\nPete is a sensitive and inescapably complicated<br />\nman, someone who has been created, destroyed,<br />\nand resurrected in his attempts to fit into society.<br />\nHis ambivalence toward the social and political<br />\nimport of his duty in Vietnam makes his story a<br />\ndifficult one to render. But Schaeffer's intricate<br />\nnarrative layers, which constantly alter the psychic<br />\ndistance between Pete and the reader, give her a<br />\nwide range of colors with which to paint Pete for<br />\nthe reader. The structure of the novel itself, which<br />\nis less regimented, allows her to wade through<br />\nethnic, social, psychological, and spiritual idioms<br />\nwithout tripping up the feel of the story.<br />\nThe first portion of \"Buffalo Afternoon\" charts<br />\nthe immigration to America of the Bravado family, sketching Pete's family life and his development as a child. Schaeffer packs an amazing<br />\nnumber of years and people into these pages, as<br />\nshe conveys the intricate relationships within<br />\nPete's extended\u2014and extensive\u2014Italian family.<br />\nFrom Pete's brief, intense connection with his<br />\ngrandfather to his caring, but tentative relationships with the women in his family, Schaeffer captures nicely the social and psychological oddities<br />\nof the Bravados. Her characters have roots in corn-<br /><br />\nmon stereotypes, but they refuse to lock neatly<br />\ninto them.<br />\nPete Bravado's biggest problem is his father.<br />\nGeorge Bravado does not understand his son, and<br />\n(as with everything he cannot fathom), he tries<br />\nto place Pete under the umbrella of his experience.<br />\nGeorge makes it difficult for Pete to study, even<br />\nto stay in school, and he constantly berates Pete's<br />\nhumanist values. Adolescent Pete deals with this<br />\nsuppression by reflecting it inward: \"[Pete] had<br />\nlearned long ago it was best not to say too much.<br />\nIf you kept quiet, no one could run into the kitchen and make fun of what you just said. According to his father, everything he said was stupid<br />\nor crazy.\" George's effect on Pete, whose sensitivity makes him an easy target, is tangible and<br />\ndefinite. His influence eats away at Pete.<br />\nthroughout the novel, pinning him down and overshadowing over his personality.<br />\nDespite overt attempts to save Pete by his<br />\nmother and grandmother\u2014they don't have the<br />\nstrength to pull him from George's chokehold\u2014<br />\nPete turns his virtues on himself. His sharp mind,<br />\nso well attuned to the intricacies of human<br /><br />\nSchaeffer avoids hyperbole<br />\nin describing the War by<br />\nletting Pete\u2014not her own<br />\npolitics\u2014do the talking.<br />\nbehavior, reverts to vandalism and truancy,<br />\nresulting in reform school and, down the line, even<br />\ngloomier prospects. Schaeffer's rich, complex<br />\npresentation of the situation confounds the first<br />\npart of the novel and disjoints it at times. But often<br />\nshe cuts right to .its center, leaving no doubt as<br />\nto her characters' motivations.<br />\nUnable to resolve his anger at his father, Pete<br />\ndecides to escape. With his mother's reluctant<br />\nconsent, he enters the Army at seventeen and is<br />\nimmediately sent to Vietnam. Instantly Schaeffer's<br />\nstrength as a novelist becomes apparent: the middle portion of the novel, dealing with Vietnam and<br />\nPete's experience there, is explicit and compelling.<br />\nSchaeffer does not try to recreate the War or<br />\nuse its grotesque aspects to add to her narrative.<br />\nInstead, she records the emotional experience of<br /><br />\nThe Freshman One-Acts<br />\nPromising Freshman Talent Performs \"The Patient,\"<br />\n\"A Dopey Fairy Tale,\"\"Am I Blue?\"and \"The Best<br />\nLittle Whorehouse in Texas\"<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nThe Freshman One-Acts, performed in the<br />\nArellano Theatre from October 1-3, can't be<br />\nmeasured entirely by quality. Enthusiasm and<br />\npotential are what count here, and many of the<br />\nperformers in the four short plays overflowed with it. Energy hid the weaknesses, and<br />\nallowed for odd flashes of talent to peek through<br />\noccasionally.<br />\nIn the One-Acts, a series of three short plays<br />\nand one short musical, dialogue and song erupt<br />\nfrom the actors witftsuch rapidity and projection<br />\nthat even the most sluggish of plots could become<br />\ndifficult to follow. And predictably, as the material<br />\nslowed to accomodate the subtleties of more<br />\nseasoned performers, many just ran out of gas.<br />\nThe first play was Agatha Christie's \"The Patient.\" It's a routine whodunit, one that Christie<br />\nprobably could have doodled on a cocktail napkin.<br />\nA critically ill (and very rich) woman has been<br />\npushed from the balcony of her room, and the stoic<br />\nInspector Cray (Darlene Lee) must sniff out the<br />\nmurderer.<br />\nThe casting here, as throughout the One-Acts,<br />\nis good. Everyone seems quite at ease and well<br />\nstudied in their parts; we never wonder if a certain actor would have been better placed in a different piece. In \"The Patient,\" the character<br />\nstrokes are quite broad, and everyone has lots of<br />\nroom for interpretation. The cast performed best<br />\nwhen on stage together, revealing in their<br />\nrecriminations and bitterness towards each other.<br />\nThe play bogs down when Inspector Cray begins<br />\nto interview suspects individually, as her solemnity becomes a bit too weighty.<br />\nAs Cray, Lee takes some getting used to, but<br />\nher straightforward nature, oddly comical<br />\ndelivery, and ubiquitous yellow legal pad are a<br />\ndelight to watch. Michael Gibson plays the<br /><br />\nphilandering husband, Bryan Wingfield, with an<br />\nearnestness and measure that is compelling. As<br />\nhis misanthropic sister-in-law, Emmeline Ross,<br />\nSigne Redfield also shows promise and theatrical<br />\nmaturity with her icy delivery and propriety.<br />\nOne of the flaws with \"The Patient\" is that the<br />\nplay is somewhat bleak and requires restraint from<br />\nthe performers. \"A Dopey Fairy Tale,\" on the<br />\nother hand, is a freewheeling romp of idiocy<br />\nsprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. \"Dopey\"<br />\ncombines and twists a thousand standard fairy tale<br />\narchetypes: the baker and his wife, enchanted<br />\nfrogs, weeping princesses, and happy endings.<br />\nIt's a derivative story, but again the enthusiasm<br />\nof the performers rubs off on us and we get caught<br />\nup in the action, however stupid. Smile (David<br />\nKuhn), a schizophrenic mixture of narrators,<br />\nguides us through the tale. It doesn't really need<br />\nhis guidance, but it's part of the fun, and Smile\u2014<br />\npart Ed Grimley, part Rod Sterling\u2014is hilarious.<br />\nAs the Bakers' son Clarence, Dave Edelman<br />\ntakes his part and runs with it. Clarence can imitate anyone, and Edelman plunges into the role<br />\nwith innate ability. If the material weren't so<br />\nchildish, you might think you were witnessing<br />\nJohn Belushi doing stand-up. As Chatter, the family pooch, Ryan Whiteman's part sounds harder<br />\nthan it is. Whiteman has the physical aspects of<br />\nthe part down, but on occasion he gets a bit too<br />\nsmirky, and you want to box his ears.<br />\nEveryone in \"The Dopey Fairy Tale\" attacks<br />\nthe campy material with fervor, but too often the<br />\nactors revolve within themselves, stepping on each<br />\nother's lines\u2014not out of egotism, but from sheer<br />\nimpatience.

Schaeffer avoids hyperbole in describing the War by assuming an admirably evenhanded, distant position in the narrative: she lets Pete<br />\ndo the talking, so to speak, and the psychological<br />\npower of the effect is impressive.<br />\nUpon Pete's return from Vietnam, \"Buffalo<br />\nAfternoon\" lapses into a convoluted and<br />\nsomewhat sluggish account of Pete's experiences<br />\nas a \"typical\" veteran.

As a result, the marriage, divorce,<br />\nviolence, and depression that riddle Pete's life after<br />\nservice take on new dimensions. Unfortunately,<br />\nSchaeffer leaves too much of this territory uncharted; she becomes lazy in examining<br />\nPete's thoughts and motives.<br />\nSeveral chapters in \"Buffalo Afternoon\" are<br />\nconfusing and unclear; they represent Schaeffer's<br /><br />\nweakest moments. As a thread through the novel<br />\nshe includes a \"second voice,\" the narrative of<br />\na Vietnamese woman whose overall role in the<br />\nnovel is never clear. Although my curiosity about<br />\nthis character was acute at first, Schaeffer never<br />\ncompleted the connection between her and Pete<br />\nBravado, leaving the novel with an uncomfortable<br />\nstructural hole. Like several other extraneous<br />\nelements in \"Buffalo Afternoon,\" this voice<br />\nproves too much for the novelist to support.<br />\nStill, these flaws are minor distractions.

Human<br />\nbeings have dermatoglyphics on the fingers, palms, toes, and soles.<br />\nIn the third to fourth month of gestation, the texture of fetal skin<br />\nchanges from smooth to ridged. The lower of the two layers of skin,<br />\nthe dermis, acquires multiple closely-spaced little peaks. The upper<br />\nlayer of skin, the epidermis, grows out of the dermis and adopts a<br />\nmodified version of its texture--ridges following the pattern of the<br />\npeaks.<br />\nSince the texture of the epidermis is determined by the dermis,<br />\nthe only way to erase fingerprints is to destroy the dermis. John Dillinger, notorious gangster, doused his fingers with acid to get rid of<br />\nhis prints, forgetting that his palms also had dermatoglyphics.<br />\nNobody, not even identical twins, could possibly have the same<br />\ndermatoglyphics.

It is so long that to<br />\nfit inside the cell, it must be wrapped up tightly. Before the genetic<br />\ninformation on it can be read, the<br />\nDNA must be unwrapped. After<br />\nthe genetic code has been<br />\ntranslated into a heart, eyeball, or<br />\nfinger, the DNA has to be rewrapped lest the body grow too<br />\nmany of anything. The timing of<br />\nunwrapping and re-wrapping of<br />\nDNA is thus critical to development. Proteins control the wrapping and unwrapping of the<br />\nDNA,so scientists are anxious to<br />\ndiscover how DNA-protein complexes work.<br />\nThe hydroxyl radical cuts between the nucleotides of DNA<br />\nmolecules. Tullius first labels<br />\nnucleotides of his chosen DNA,<br />\nand subjects it to the Fenton reaction. By limiting the reaction<br />\ntime, Tullius can generally limit<br /><br />\nthe hydroxyl radical to cleaving<br />\njust one bond on every DNA<br />\nmolecule. He extracts the labeled DNA fragments, and throws<br />\nthe rest of the DNA out.

Relying heavily upon<br />\nmanager Earl Weaver's favorite<br />\nstrategy, Dr. Longball, particularly in the form of a threerun shot, Brooks, Murray, Lee<br />\nMay, and Boog Powell provided<br />\nnumerous memories and more<br />\nruns.<br /><br />\nThe O's were a welldisciplined team that emphasized<br />\nfundamentals and did not make<br />\nmental errors.

Unknown farmhands<br />\npitching shutouts or slapping<br />\ncrucial basehits was not startling.<br />\nThe O's advertised, \"Every night<br />\nit's a different star:\" and they<br />\nwere right. \"Oriole Magic\" was<br />\nmore than a slogan.<br />\nThen after the 1983 World<br />\nSeries celebration, the magic<br />\ndissipated. The Orioles became a<br />\nmiddle-of-the-pack organization,<br />\nthen descended to a losing team,<br />\nand finally hit the depths of<br />\nhumiliation in 1988. Twenty-one<br />\nconsecutive losses, a 54-107<br />\nseason record: the memory<br />\ndisgusts.<br />\nThe Orioles' problems were<br />\nobvious. Too many strong and incompatible personalities caused<br />\nstrife and discontent.

Eight service<br />\naces, including the match ending<br />\nace by freshman Firouzeh<br />\nBahrampour, bolstered a strong<br />\nattack which boasted 34 kills.<br />\nJones also complimented Suzy<br /><br />\nYoon for her performance as setter. Yoon, usually a back row hitter, has filled in at setter for injured co-captain Trang Pham.<br />\nPham will be unavailable for play<br />\nuntil next week due to an ankle<br />\ninjury which she sustained last<br />\nThursday in the tri-match held at<br />\nCatonsville Community College.<br />\nIn the first match at<br />\nCatonsville, Hopkins beat the<br />\nDelaware College junior varsity<br />\nteam, 15-13 and 15-12. Hopkins<br />\nlost 5-15 and 9-15 to Catonsville<br />\nCommunity College in the second<br />\nmatch.<br />\nThe Jays' upcoming opponents<br />\ninclude Franklin &amp; Marshall,<br />\nGallaudet, and St. Mary's. Coach<br />\nJones is optimistic about the Blue<br />\nJays' chances against these teams:<br />\n\"Our team is aggressive and<br />\ncompetitive and should do well.\"<br /><br />\nColumbia University's location in New York City makes it the ideal<br />\nplace for graduate study in business.

Tami<br />\nMeyer is back to her prime form<br />\nof earlier in the season, as she<br />\nfinished second for the Jays in<br />\n20:43.

Even in our own<br />\nbackyard, there is hardly a time<br />\nwhen you won't find Hopkins<br />\nstudents running the track or doing a Charles Village circuit.<br />\nWhile you'll certainly see people<br />\nof every shape and size running<br />\nor jogging in different ways,<br />\nthere are a few basics that the<br />\nfitness-conscious runner should<br />\nconsider before embarking on a<br />\ntraining program.<br />\nFirst, there is a real difference<br />\nbetween running and jogging.<br />\nNot only in speed, but in frame<br />\nof mind as well. The typical jogger will jog for health benefits<br />\nand not for any real \"addletion\"to jogging. The serious runner, on the other hand, might<br />\nconsider running even if he<br />\nthought it had no positive fitness<br />\nresults.<br />\nThe more important difference,<br />\nthough, is in the speed and impact of training. For a fitness program to be aerobically sound, the<br />\nheart rate must be increased by<br />\na certain amount. Gabe Mirkin,<br />\nexpert in sports medicine at the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, writes,<br />\n\"To get maximum benefit, you<br />\nmust run hard enough to raise<br />\nyour pulse to 120 beats per<br />\nminute two to three times per<br />\nweek.\" Jogging, while it may<br />\nhelp tone muscle and improve<br />\noverall health, is not as sound<br />\naerobically. It is important to note<br />\nthat, for some, hard running can<br />\nbe dangerous. According to Dr.<br />\nMirkin, people who are over thirty, or fear risk of heart attack in<br />\nduced by exercise, should have a<br />\nstress electrocardiogram done.<br />\nSecond, wearing proper clothes<br />\nand shoes are key factors to<br />\navoiding injury. Good running<br />\nshoes should be measured not only in terms of length, but also in<br />\nwidth. If you are not the usual D<br />\nwidth, do not settle for the usual<br />\nshoe. Find a store that carries<br />\nrunning sneakers in different<br />\nwidths. A good running shoe has<br />\nattributes that will limit pronation, including arch-supports, a<br />\nflexible sole, and a wide heel.<br />\nAlong with good shoes, wear thin<br />\nsocks. Thick socks, while they<br />\nmight reduce stress from running,<br />\nalso prevent the shoe from reducing pronation, which commonly<br />\nleads to injury.<br />\n- Third, ease into a running program slowly and build up over the<br />\ncourse of a few weeks. Once you<br />\nbegin a running program, do not<br />\npractice the same circuit and the<br />\nsame distance each day-this can<br />\nbe tedious, put too much stress on<br />\na single muscle group, and make<br /><br />\nSoccer shoots down Bears<br /><br />\nit more difficult to run farther in<br />\nthe future.<br />\nProper form for running means<br />\nthat as your feet come down, you<br />\nland on your heels not your toes.<br />\nDo not lean forward, as is the<br />\nnatural tendency. Instead, keep<br />\nyou back straight. For the most<br />\npart, you arms should be relaxed and your hand loosely closed.<br />\nLastly, when planning a running regimen, plan wisely. Limit<br />\nyour hard runs to three times a<br />\nweek (not on consecutive days),<br />\nand stretch before-and after every<br />\nrun. Running hard more then<br />\nthree times weekly will not improve your cardiovascular health<br />\nand might lead to exhaustion or<br />\nstress-related injury. Even in hard<br />\nruns, you should not push<br />\nyourself to unsafe levels. While<br />\nbreathing deeply can be expected,<br />\nhaving to gasp for air means that<br />\nyou have pushed yourself to a<br />\ndangerous extreme. Be careful to<br />\nknow when you have worked you<br />\nbody past safe levels. Also, as<br />\nyou conclude a run, never stop<br />\nmotion immediately. Slow your<br />\npace to a jog and ease your pulse<br />\nrate down. Sudden stops of all activity can be harmful to your<br />\nheart.<br />\nTo prevent running injury, the<br />\nbest advice is to pay attention to<br />\nthe warning signs of your body.<br />\nDo not run if your legs feel stressed and heavy-that is sometimes<br />\na signal that they are still healing<br />\nfrom the last run. The same is<br />\ntrue of other injuries. It is a common myth that you can \"run<br />\nthrough\" an injury, causing it to<br />\ndisappear. While some of us may<br />\nhave had the experience of running until a cramp goes away, this<br />\nis not generally good practice.<br />\nTrying to \"run through\" an injury will cause the condition to<br />\nget worse or create new injuries.<br />\nOn the nutrition front, there is<br />\nenough information for a series<br />\nof columns. One of the most important dietary rules, though<br />\nspecifically for women who run,<br />\nwas suggested by Robert Haas in<br />\nEat to Win. He believes that<br />\nwomen who run should be<br />\nespecially concious of their iron<br />\nlevels. They may not need iron<br />\nsupplements to run, but they<br />\nshould be sure to get enough in<br />\ntheir normal diets. Usually, a<br />\nwoman can maintain the proper<br />\namounts of iron by eating a few<br />\ncups of legumes each week.<br />\nAs millions of Americans(and<br />\na large group of Hopkins<br />\nstudents) will testify, running can<br />\nbecome a positive addiction. It is<br />\nan exercise that will pay off not<br />\nonly in terms of aerobic and<br />\nmuscular benefits, but will also<br />\nimprove your quality of living.<br /><br />\nCLASSIFIEDS<br />\nCollege/Campus Representative:<br />\nEarn top $ Flexible hours, fun, enjoyable, rewarding Gross up to<br />\n$20,000 per year by helping friends<br />\nreceive grants/scholarships For info<br />\nplease call.
