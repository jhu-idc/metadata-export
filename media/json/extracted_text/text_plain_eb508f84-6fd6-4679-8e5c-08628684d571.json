First, he expounds on ideas concerning<br />\nby others,<br />\nHopkins which are either his own or, having been suggested<br />\nseem to him worthy of comment. Secondly, he should endeavor to<br />\nexpress the opinions of the student body, whether or no he believes<br />\nthose opinions to be well founded. A number of complaints have<br />\ncome to this department in the last few weeks and, since they are<br />\ncommon to a number of undergraduates, they should be set forth.<br />\nSome we do not agree with, others 'seem just, but they all, at least,<br />\nshould be presented to the student body.<br />\n<br />\nTHE CAFETERIA: By far the largest number of complaints have<br />\nto deal with the cafeteria in Levering Hall. \"The prices are too high,\"<br />\nis the main subject of the lamentations. A minor note is struck by<br />\nsome who claim that \"The food is no good,\" while a third group<br />\nmutter that \"The portions aren't big enough.\" The prices of Mr.<br />\nAdams, Ph.D., are loudly extolled and his departure for parts unknown lamented. To prove that they are not partisan, the declaimers<br />\nagainst the cafeteria assert that everything was perfect in Levering Hall<br />\nat the beginning of the year.<br />\nEXAMINATIONS: The grounds for complaint against exams vary<br />\nwith almost every individual. Briefly they are as follows: Exams are<br />\nchildish, have no place in a first-class university, and therefore should<br />\nbe abolished entirely; three hours is too short for a test on four<br />\nmonths' work; three hours is too long to write steadily; the period<br />\nfor examinations is too short time, as more time should be allowed<br />\nbetween each one; the period for examinations is too long and we<br />\nshould get them over with as quickly as possible in order to have a<br />\nrest before returning to college; the usual exam has too many memory<br />\nquestions contained in it; exams do not give enough memory questions<br />\nas the professor goes outside of his subject in demanding knowledge<br />\nnot in the text book; and so on ad infinitum.<br />\nTHE MARKING SYSTEM: Only three classes of complaints on<br />\nthis score: 1. The present marking system is terrible. 2. The new<br />\nmarking system is terrible. 3. Any marking system is terrible.<br />\nATHLETICS: A great number of students feel that Hopkins should<br />\nendeavor to attract good prep-school athletes in order to build up a<br />\nfine football team. They feel that the advertising value of a strong<br />\nteam justifies any means, however drastic. Others, who do not agree<br />\nwith the value to be derived from proselyting, still complain of the<br />\nfact that a poor team is bad advertising and recommend the abolition<br />\nof the gridiron sport altogether. The poor condition of the tennis<br />\ncourts and the absence of proper locker and shower accommodations<br />\nhave given rise to many murmurings, though these are growing fewer<br />\nsince the announcement that the Conditions would be improved.<br />\nTHE NEW PLAN: Many undergraduates maintain that the overemphasis placed on th6 new plan .is causing the rapid degeneration of<br />\nthe undergraduate school. Some few complaints are being made against<br />\nthe plan itself on the grounds that the men admitted to advance work<br />\nin the graduate school arc unprepared and also that the problems that<br />\nthey interest themselves in have little or no value.<br />\nWell, there is, at least, plenty of room for discussion on the topics<br />\nlisted above. Perhaps some solutions to the complaints may arise from<br />\n\"bull-sessions,\" ostensibly called to study for exams: And, by the<br />\nway, good luck on the mid-years!<br />\n<br />\nThe Pipe<br />\neven helps you say<br />\nnothing at all \u2022 \u2022 \u2022<br />\n'VOU'VE noticed how expressive<br />\nthe pipe can be, what meaning<br />\nit can put into the simplest gesture.<br />\nThe pipe even helps you say nothing<br />\nat all\u2014and that, 0 mortal, takes<br />\na man among men!<br />\nMen to their pipes and women<br />\nto their lipsticks\u2014but suppose you<br />\nhad no pipe and faced repression?<br />\nSuppose you had no tobacco to put<br />\nin your pipe!

Secondly, he should endeavor to<br />\nexpress the opinions of the student body, whether or no he believes<br />\nthose opinions to be well founded. A number of complaints have<br />\ncome to this department in the last few weeks and, since they are<br />\ncommon to a number of undergraduates, they should be set forth.<br />\nSome we do not agree with, others 'seem just, but they all, at least,<br />\nshould be presented to the student body.<br /><br />\nTHE CAFETERIA: By far the largest number of complaints have<br />\nto deal with the cafeteria in Levering Hall. \"The prices are too high,\"<br />\nis the main subject of the lamentations. A minor note is struck by<br />\nsome who claim that \"The food is no good,\" while a third group<br />\nmutter that \"The portions aren't big enough.\" The prices of Mr.<br />\nAdams, Ph.D., are loudly extolled and his departure for parts unknown lamented. To prove that they are not partisan, the declaimers<br />\nagainst the cafeteria assert that everything was perfect in Levering Hall<br />\nat the beginning of the year.<br />\nEXAMINATIONS: The grounds for complaint against exams vary<br />\nwith almost every individual. Briefly they are as follows: Exams are<br />\nchildish, have no place in a first-class university, and therefore should<br />\nbe abolished entirely; three hours is too short for a test on four<br />\nmonths' work; three hours is too long to write steadily; the period<br />\nfor examinations is too short time, as more time should be allowed<br />\nbetween each one; the period for examinations is too long and we<br />\nshould get them over with as quickly as possible in order to have a<br />\nrest before returning to college; the usual exam has too many memory<br />\nquestions contained in it; exams do not give enough memory questions<br />\nas the professor goes outside of his subject in demanding knowledge<br />\nnot in the text book; and so on ad infinitum.<br />\nTHE MARKING SYSTEM: Only three classes of complaints on<br />\nthis score: 1. The present marking system is terrible. 2. The new<br />\nmarking system is terrible. 3. Any marking system is terrible.<br />\nATHLETICS: A great number of students feel that Hopkins should<br />\nendeavor to attract good prep-school athletes in order to build up a<br />\nfine football team. They feel that the advertising value of a strong<br />\nteam justifies any means, however drastic. Others, who do not agree<br />\nwith the value to be derived from proselyting, still complain of the<br />\nfact that a poor team is bad advertising and recommend the abolition<br />\nof the gridiron sport altogether. The poor condition of the tennis<br />\ncourts and the absence of proper locker and shower accommodations<br />\nhave given rise to many murmurings, though these are growing fewer<br />\nsince the announcement that the Conditions would be improved.<br />\nTHE NEW PLAN: Many undergraduates maintain that the overemphasis placed on th6 new plan .is causing the rapid degeneration of<br />\nthe undergraduate school. Some few complaints are being made against<br />\nthe plan itself on the grounds that the men admitted to advance work<br />\nin the graduate school arc unprepared and also that the problems that<br />\nthey interest themselves in have little or no value.<br />\nWell, there is, at least, plenty of room for discussion on the topics<br />\nlisted above. Perhaps some solutions to the complaints may arise from<br />\n\"bull-sessions,\" ostensibly called to study for exams: And, by the<br />\nway, good luck on the mid-years!<br /><br />\nThe Pipe<br />\neven helps you say<br />\nnothing at all \u2022 \u2022 \u2022<br />\n'VOU'VE noticed how expressive<br />\nthe pipe can be, what meaning<br />\nit can put into the simplest gesture.<br />\nThe pipe even helps you say nothing<br />\nat all\u2014and that, 0 mortal, takes<br />\na man among men!<br />\nMen to their pipes and women<br />\nto their lipsticks\u2014but suppose you<br />\nhad no pipe and faced repression?<br />\nSuppose you had no tobacco to put<br />\nin your pipe!
