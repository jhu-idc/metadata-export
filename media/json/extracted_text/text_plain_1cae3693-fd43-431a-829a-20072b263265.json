Eisenhower announced that there would be<br />\nno tuition increases during his term as interim<br />\npresident. He did state upon his retirement that his<br />\nsuccessor would almost certainly have to impose a rise<br />\nin tuition. True to that prediction, Steven Muller<br />\nannounced last Friday that he would ask the Board of<br />\nTrustees for an increase in tuition of at least $300 at<br />\ntheir meeting this month in Williamsburg, Virginia.<br />\nWhile it is obvious that the University needs to<br />\nobtain more money from some source in order to<br />\nbalance its budget by 1974, there is some question as<br />\nto why the students should be expected to provide the<br />\nbulk of the money. A little quick arithmetic shows<br />\nthat 2200 students all paying, from some source, $300<br />\nmore in tuition will provide $660,000 in additional<br />\nfunds, very close to the total expected budget deficit<br />\nof $750,000 for the Arts and Sciences division this<br />\nyear. This increase will place a real hardship on the<br />\nalready hard-pressed student, especially the junior or<br />\nsophomore who cannot transfer to another, less<br />\nexpensive institution before next year, who will have<br />\nno choice except to pay the higher rate, or drop out of<br />\nschool altogether.<br />\nUnless President Muller can come up with facts and<br />\nfigures to back up his proposal at tonight's Student<br />\nCouncil meeting, there is no reason students should be<br />\nexpected to pay anything more than $2700 for a year<br />\nof a Hopkins education.<br />\n<br />\nWOE HOME,POWs!<br />\n<br />\nRobert Ruby<br />\nEd Brethauer, Mark Leifer<br />\n<br />\nassociate editor<br />\ncirculation manager<br />\n<br />\nSue Woolhiser<br />\nNancy Forgione<br />\n<br />\nproduction manager<br />\nClayton Buick<br />\nphoto-production manager<br />\nBill Waters<br />\nstaff writers:Lloyd Berkowitz, Richard Bland,<br />\nMark Borsi, John<br />\nBortz, Joe Cantor, Sharon Feldstein, Martin<br />\nFrench, Peter<br />\nGardner, Linda Grace, Jeff Greene, Arthur<br />\nKougell, Andy<br />\nLashley, Herbert Loveless, Tom Nathan, Jerry<br />\nNeser, Bob<br />\nPaulus, Allen Short, Alvin Stein, Mitch Tenzer<br />\nsports staff: Mike Bereston, Steve Brown, Nils<br />\nBrubaker, Robert<br />\nFreundlich, Gerry Greenfield, Barry Kemelhor, Chuck<br />\nSlonin,<br />\nMike Slowinski,Lawrence Weinstein<br />\nproduction staff: Susan Blum, Mark Gallagher, Dick Scholz,<br />\nMark Secor<br />\nthe news-lett. is published twice each week during the school year by the<br />\nstudents of the johns hopkins university, homewood campus, baltimore,<br />\nmaryland. editorial and businesscorrespondence should be directed to<br />\nbox 1230, the johns hopkins university, baltimore, maryland 21218;<br />\ntelephone 301-366-3300, extension 1308, subscriptions $8 per annum.<br />\nmember columbia scholastic press association.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was going to ignore Mike Siegel's first<br />\ntirade against women at Hopkins. After I<br />\nwas told that he had been denied a room<br />\nin Wolman Hall this year, I dismissed his<br />\nargument against women securing housing<br />\npriority as personal and understandably<br />\nbitter, based on his own experiences<br />\ndealing with a school that considers itself<br />\nbenevolent if it gives anyone a place to<br />\nlive. Later, I advised him to organize the<br />\nmale students, much like we had done<br />\namong women, to gain housing reforms.<br />\nThe answer to room shortage here is not<br />\nto denounce Hopkins women for<br />\nguaranteeing themselves a roof over their<br />\nheads. Instead Siegal and others who<br />\nrightfully feel the way he does should<br />\nemulate us to gain victory, too. The<br />\ntrouble at Hopkins is that everybody<br />\ngrumbles a lot and thinks about<br />\ntransferring , but that is as far as activism<br />\ngoes. Then when a group like Hopkins<br />\nWomen's Liberation emerges and shows<br />\nkty.A. .\u2022\u2018_% me.xxxbecs ace. c-t-kcxe. tkvack c..(Neci<br />\n<br />\ndid not happen; or, in other words,<br />\nfantasy culled from his own imagination.<br />\nThat is not satire; That is pure myth<br />\nmaking. I am not clear on the<br />\nNews-Letter's policy of accepting articles,<br />\nbut if you editors out there are going to<br />\ngive Siegel a column and not call it<br />\nOpinion, then I believe it is your<br />\nresponsibility to verify his facts.<br />\nI did not tell Siegel in Mafia-like<br />\nfashion that we were trying to \"contact\"<br />\nhim. Instead, in trying to be friendly<br />\n(indeed, I knew whom he was\u2014no one<br />\nhad to shout in my ear that he was the<br />\nBad Guy, nor did I suddenly become<br />\nhostile after unmasking his identity in<br />\nmelodramatic Zorro style), I mentioned<br />\nthat I would have invited him to the<br />\nmeetin, if I had known where he lived. I<br />\nmust admit that I didn't try very hard to<br />\nlocate him, so let's dispense with the<br />\nmyth that my henchmen had prowled the<br />\navenues stalking him out. We had more<br />\nessential things to do on the eve of a<br />\n<br />\nthe Women's Center because we want<br />\nfemale students to be an integral part of<br />\nthe community. This is in direct contrast<br />\nto Siegel's portrayal of us as man-eating<br />\nAmazons, determined to be Hopkins<br />\nseparatists. Besides the fact we have male<br />\nmembers within our ranks, we women<br />\nalso have among us the president of the<br />\nJewish Students Association, the<br />\nrepresentative on the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies, several teaching<br />\nassistants, and two program directors of<br />\nthe gymnasium. In other words, we are<br />\nnot only women activists, we are students<br />\nactivists concerned with the general state<br />\nof Hopkins. Thus concerned, we want to<br />\nimprove that status of women here, so<br />\nthat females will want to come to<br />\nHopkins in increasing number. With the<br />\ntrend swinging back to women's colleges<br />\n(or at least universities with more equal<br />\nmale-female ratios), Hopkins will have to<br />\nshow itself to be a hell of a lot more<br />\nattractive to women if it wants a steadily<br />\n\u2022F.<br />\n<br />\nc5 CVC,<br />\n<br />\nto improve our status, then the Siegels<br />\n<br />\nto establish a hierarchy resembling the<br />\nStudent Council, in the belief that each<br />\n<br />\nshudder. Women demanding and receiving<br />\nbetter health service and housing facilities<br />\nremind Hopkins men how inactive they<br />\nhave been. Instead of experimenting with<br />\nsimilar \"student poser,\" they smear us<br />\nand retreat back to their books. What<br />\ncollege radicals.<br />\nI am more disturbed with Siegel's<br />\nsecond article as printed in Friday's<br />\nNews-Letter (September 29). Aside from<br />\nmy ideological differences with what he<br />\ntried to say, I protest its journalistic<br />\nmerit. The problem was not so much'that<br />\nit was written poorly (I can excuse that as<br />\na rush to meet a deadline) nor that it did<br />\nnot deliver its intended message, but that<br />\nit dared cloak itself in the name of satire.<br />\nLast year, the News-Letter printed a<br />\nnumber of bright articles dealing<br />\nsatiracally with issues such as the term<br />\npaper controversy and book store thefts.<br />\nThat writer succeeded because he was<br />\nable to sort out humor from the truth.<br />\nThat was satire. Siegel, on the other hand,<br />\ncould not find such absurdities at our<br />\nfirst Women's Center meeting; so,<br />\ndesperate to write a funny piece, he tried<br />\nto create a humorous situation from what<br />\n<br />\nof us is as important as the other.<br />\nUnderstandably, then, we are having<br />\ntrouble ascertaining who was the woman<br />\nwho kept points in her conversation with<br />\nSiegel. And since he sat 'way in the back<br />\nof the room all evening, he did not really<br />\nmingle with us at all. I question when he<br />\nhad the opportunity to be intimidated by<br />\nany of us. He did not ask questions, or<br />\nprovoke discussion. In short, he barely<br />\nopened his mouth in the few hours he<br />\nwas there. Too few of us knew he was<br />\nthere to even try to bother him. And<br />\nreally, in the flush of a successful evening,<br />\nshared by men (they were there, too) and<br />\nwomen, who really cared about Siegel at<br />\nall? I understand why he had to jive<br />\nthrough his article: If you don't really<br />\ncreate dynamic interaction in person,<br />\nimaginatively conjure it all up on paper.<br />\nAs one News-Letter editor advised a<br />\nfriend when he tried out to be a writer in.<br />\nhis freshman year, \"If you don't find<br />\nnews on campus, make up something,<br />\nanyway.\"<br />\nI am growing more and more disturbed<br />\nwith the image of us that is allowed to<br />\nexist at Hopkins.

A<br />\n'victory quite possibly could have<br />\nled to the MAC title; instead, the<br />\n14-10 heartbreaker handed the<br />\nJays their first setback of the<br />\nyoung ,se'ason. The most<br />\ndisappointing and frustrating<br />\nthing about: it is that the Jays<br />\ncould easily have won.<br />\nThe game- was one of missed<br />\nopportunitiq for the home team.<br />\nHopkins \\von the toss and elected<br />\nto receive.' A fourteen play,<br />\n43-yard drivs to the F&M 20<br />\nstalled iriches short of the first<br />\ndown marker and the Diplomats<br />\ntook over on,downs.<br />\nFollowing a Diplomat<br />\ntouchdOwn` late in the first<br />\nquarter, the lays staged another<br />\ncontrolled drive. Penetrating to<br />\nthe F&M 19, Tim Doyle was<br />\nstopped for no gain and Jack<br />\nThomas was sacked twice while<br />\nattempting to pass. Result:<br />\nfourth down and 26 from the<br />\nF&M 35..<br />\nOn the next offensive series,<br />\nHopkins gained control just shy<br />\nof midfield. A Thomas to Rick<br />\nKwalchuk pass was good for a<br />\nfirst down inside the F&M 40;<br />\nhowever, a rhajor penalty placed<br />\nthe ball back in Blue Jay<br />\nterritory. With a fourth and 10<br />\nthe Jays were forced to punt.<br />\nThe punt carried to the 12 yard<br />\nline where the Diplomats started<br />\nwith first and 10. Then a holding<br />\npenalty moved the ball back to<br />\nthe six. After Bob Olender, the<br />\nF&M quarter back, dropped back<br />\nto pass. Cornerback, Billy Nolan,<br />\npicked off the pass and raced<br />\ninside the 10- yard line. However,<br />\nNolan's thievery was for naught<br />\nsince offsetting panalties dictated<br />\nthat the play be done over. The<br />\nDiplomats escaped further<br />\ndamage and punted to the Blue<br />\nJay 33. Two Hopkins first downs<br />\n<br />\ngave the Jays possession inside<br />\nDiplomat territory, but again<br />\nthey w-ere pushed back and<br />\nforced to punt.<br />\nThe half ended with F&M on<br />\ntop, 7-0, with the Blue Jays<br />\nwinning the statistical battle but<br />\nlosing the war. However, stats are<br />\nmisleading: on defense the<br />\nDiplomat's made big 2nd and 3rd<br />\ndown plays, forcing the Jays into<br />\neither third down and long<br />\nyardage or fourth down and<br />\npunting situations.<br />\nThe second half opened on a<br />\nstrange note. Although F&M had<br />\nthe choice, they elected to kick<br />\nwith the wind instead of receive.<br />\nThe questionable strategic<br />\nmaneuver soon paid off. After<br />\nthe Diplomat defense held, their<br />\noffense marched 65 yards in six<br />\nplays. The drive was capped by a<br />\nwell thrown 30 year scoring<br />\nstrike from Olender to Dale<br />\nSchlief that made the score 14-0.<br />\nFollowing the kickoff,<br />\nHopkins took over deep in their<br />\nown territory. On fourth and 10<br />\nthe Blue Jays dropped into punt<br />\nformation. Jack Thomas punted<br />\na low line drive that was fielded<br />\nby a daring Diplomat Instantly<br />\nhe was hit and the ball jarred<br />\nloose. Rick Kowalchuk came up<br />\nwith the loose ball and Hopkins<br />\nhad a first and 10 on their own<br />\n40. The drive penetrated as far as<br />\nthe F&M 27, but finally ended<br />\non an incompleted fourth down<br />\npass.<br />\nThe Blue Jay defense stood<br />\nfirm and forced a punting<br />\nsituation. Billy Nolan then<br />\nelectrified the home crowd with<br />\na dazzling 52 yard punt return.<br />\nTim Doyle gained a yard to the<br />\nF&M 10, and on second down<br />\nJack Thomas found Grant<br />\nShevchik in the endzone.<br />\nThomas' kick left the Jays down<br />\n7 with more than 10 minutes to<br />\nplay.<br />\nBilly Nolan's punt return<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay thinclads<br />\nmuster only second<br />\nBy GERRY GREENFIELD<br />\nThe Hopkins cross country<br />\nteam split it's opening meet<br />\nSaturday at Towson State<br />\nCollege.; The Jays defeated<br />\nLoyola 21-40 Snd fell to a strong<br />\nTowson tearn,16-42.<br />\nConditions for the event, held<br />\nSaturday morning, were far from<br />\nideal. A light drizzle bathed<br />\nrunners before the start of the<br />\nrace, but shortly after the gun<br />\nhad sounded the mist became a<br />\ndownpour. As a result of the rain<br />\nthe cours was especially slippery<br />\nand treacherous for runners<br />\nwithout spikes or strong ankles.<br />\n,-,Thirteen<br />\nIn spite of the score and the<br />\ncondition Coach Don Masken<br />\nwas pleased with the team's<br />\nperformance. There were a total<br />\nof 27 places in the race; and<br />\nalthough _Hopkins runners only<br />\ntook two out of the first ten,<br />\nthey accounted for seven out of<br />\nthe next ten and thirteen out of<br />\nthe total twenty seven.<br />\nThe top five placers for<br />\nHopkins in the five mile race<br />\nwere: Co-captain Russ Dubiel<br />\nwith a time of 30:07, Jeff Greve<br />\n<br />\nin 30:24, Austin Doyle 31:20,<br />\nFrank Van Dyke- 31:30, and<br />\nJohn Tetzlaff 31:52. Top place<br />\nwinners for Hopkins are an<br />\nexample of the team's depth as<br />\none was a senior, two were<br />\njuniors, and two were<br />\nsophomores.<br />\nTightly Bunched<br />\nCoach Masken pointed out<br />\nthat his first five runners ran<br />\nwell and finished within 1:45 of<br />\neach other. He maintains that for<br />\nany team to win its runners must<br />\ncover the course fastest, but they<br />\nmust also run as a group and<br />\nfinish as tightly bunched as<br />\npossible. This was the strategy of<br />\nTowson which finished first<br />\nsecond, third, fourth, sixth, and<br />\ntenth. Last year at this time the<br />\nspread for the Hopkins top five<br />\nwas over four minutes, so this<br />\nyear's team has had a much<br />\nbetter start.<br />\nHistorical Page<br />\nHopkins puts its one to one<br />\nrecord on the line this Saturday<br />\nagainst Ursinus and Dickinson at<br />\nCarlisle.

This proved to be<br />\nfive, a jarring tackle forced the last serious Blue Jay threat.<br />\n<br />\nThe offense stalled at the<br />\nthirty:five after a Diplomat field<br />\ngoal attempt fell short and to the<br />\nleft, giving the Jays possession<br />\nwith about five minutes to go. A<br />\nthree play series in the waning<br />\nmoments also proved fruitless as<br />\nthe gun sounded much to<br />\neveryone's surprise.<br />\nF&M won the game because<br />\nthey have an extremely good<br />\ndefense. Their offense looked<br />\ninconsistent and unimressive.<br />\nHowever, their defensive line and<br />\nlinebackers did an excellent job<br />\nagainst the run. Although the<br />\nBlue Jays did gain close to 100<br />\nyards on rushing plays, F&M's<br />\ngambling and blitzing defense<br />\ndropped Jack Thomas eight times<br />\nwhile attempting to pass for<br />\nlosses of more than 70 yards.<br />\nIt was a good F&M team that<br />\nthe Blue Jays played against. The<br />\nJays had eight good scoring<br />\nopportunities but could cash in<br />\non only two for 10 points.

He was standing right on the edge of the<br />\nwater, looking like the ghost of Edward Teach<br />\nhimself, even though he was past sixty and a bit<br />\nhunched over. And those weathered sun-browned<br />\nhands of his were sqeezing the cork handle of that<br />\nfamous custom pole with the three big 'eyes'<br />\nspaced away from the grip so's the line could come<br />\n\u00b0ut faster. He always said you could get better<br />\ndistance on your casts with a pole wrapped that<br />\nWay, and I supposed he was right because I never<br />\ndid see anybody beat<br />\nhim.<br />\nHe was standing there beside a<br />\nbucket full of menhaden, chewing on the stub of<br />\nhis corncob pipe--with the bowl turned<br />\nUpsidedown\u2014and moving his bony fingers<br />\nto crank<br />\nthat old, Langley reel. He had<br />\ntold me a dozen<br />\ntimes<br />\nbefore that a Langley was the best in the<br />\n\u00b0rid and that people couldn't get them anymore<br />\nnecause they went out of business just after World<br />\nVV<br />\n,ar II. 01' Curtis probably knew more about<br />\n\"ings than anyone--and if he was to say he had<br />\neen `Hatteress Jack,' You could be pretty damn<br />\niure there really was a white porpoise that guided<br />\nniPs through the rough water around the.Cape.<br />\nAnyway, it was a cold morning<br />\n:<br />\nI'd 'everything was so dark I couldn't hardly tell<br />\nhere the sea ended and the sky began. My face<br />\nas wet with spray from the swells--which carried<br />\nith it the raw smell of salt--and that morning I<br />\n.0kuld taste it. The<br />\nwind was up, and coming hard<br />\ne it was going to blow us all the way across Kill<br />\nevil Hills and into Albemarle Sound.<br />\nWell, when I got close enough to<br />\nhurtis, I called out to him, and he looked over his<br />\nee'ulder. But he didn't.answer until I was right up<br />\n,:de him and his bucket of dead menhaden:<br />\ntvell Boy, we got ourselves a Nor'easter blowin'<br />\nit'll be pretty sparse for awhile. But in a day or<br />\nthem fish'll be jumpin' right on your hooks.\"<br />\n\"Did your bum leg tell you that,<br />\nttis\u2022<br />\nI asked him. He always complained about<br />\npad leg and I had heard that<br />\nold people with<br />\nche<br />\nes. s and pains could predict the weather\u2014and<br />\ns l.des, it was a fact that Curtis' leg was a kind of<br />\ntitlition all over the Outer Banks<br />\n--the way<br />\nl)r<br />\nee body always talked about it\u2014 and sometimes<br />\n\"vould even get flustered and say<br />\nthat people<br />\nre<br />\nMaking fun of him because he was a cripple.<br />\n\"No, Boy,\" he said, \"a Nor'easter<br />\n<br />\nbrings in the warm water, and with the warm water<br />\ncomes the fish--jest as soon as the wind shifts over<br />\nto the west and clears things up a bit.\"<br />\nI was about to mumble something<br />\nwhen I noticed somebody coming toward us who<br />\nlooked almost like one of them ancient Greeks in<br />\nthe history books. He was wearing an Army<br />\nrain-parka with the hood pulled up over the back<br />\nof his head\u2014and on the side of his face was a mass<br />\nof thick white scars. It was like he was wearing<br />\nhelmet and carrying a spear instead of a fishing<br />\npole, and near as I could tell, there was a rusty<br />\nolive-colored box, an ammunition case, in his other<br />\nhand. He was the man me and Curtis met up at the<br />\npier in Kitty Hawk just the other day, and Curtis<br />\nhad invited him out to do a little bottom-fishing.<br />\nHis name was Lassiter.<br />\n\"Good morning,\" he said when he<br />\ngot up to us, \"I thought the weather might keep an<br />\nold man with a bad leg in bed.\"<br />\nCurtis kind of sneered at him.<br />\n\"Hell, I useta run moonshine in worse than this.\"<br />\n<br />\nKill Devil Hills<br />\nNumber 1<br />\nNow there were some stories<br />\nabout people who used to run bootleg whiskey<br />\nacross the Sound to the mainland, but I didn't<br />\nknow Curtis had ever done it until right then.<br />\n\"It must have been pretty potent<br />\nstuff,\" Lassiter said.<br />\n\"Enough to kill the devil,\" Curtis<br />\ntold him. \"Fact is, my daddy useta make it back in<br />\nthem days when that strip of ocean out there was<br />\ncalled 'Torpedo Junction'.\"<br />\nCurtis had told me all about that<br />\nbefore\u2014how the Gulf Stream flowed north and the<br />\nLabrador Current south, but right next to each<br />\nother so's the shipping lanes were so close together<br />\nthat the merchantmen passing by were sitting<br />\nducks for the U-Boats. And then the Bankers<br />\nwould always come down to the beach after a<br />\n<br />\nNortheaster to look at the wreckage and the<br />\nbroken bodies that had washed up. But I didn't<br />\nthink Lassiter had heard the story, so I asked<br />\nCurtis to tell it to him.<br />\n\"Not much a body can tell Mr.<br />\nLassiter about war--'scuse me, I mean `Cap'n'<br />\nLassiter. Why he's got more medals than most I<br />\never knowed.\"<br />\nLassiter sort of smiled as he<br />\nreached down into his ammunition box to get a<br />\ncarton of bloodworms. \"I was just plain lucky,<br />\nCurtis. With the wrong move I could've been<br />\nfertilizer in somebody's backyard.\" He was sliding<br />\none of them creatures on to his hook.<br />\nCurtis scowled, if you could call it<br />\na scowl--the way his mouth tried to curve with the<br />\npipe still in it. \"Too damned expensive,\" he<br />\nmuttered\u2014referring to the worms which had come<br />\nfrom up north-- in Nova Scotia. The way I<br />\nunderstood it, nobody but winos would dig for<br />\nthem, and they were always going on strike<br />\nbecause the Canadian Government kept raising the<br />\nprice of wine. So, by the time the worms got to the<br />\nBanks they weren't exactly cheap. I didn't like<br />\nthem worms much anyway--mainly because they<br />\nwere always crawling around dead things. Curtis<br />\nhardly ever used them either\u2014and, of course, when<br />\nit came to fishing, he knew just about everything.<br />\nThere wasn't a man from Elizabeth City to Cape<br />\nLookout who knew as much as he did--or at least<br />\nthat's the way I felt about it.<br />\n\"Well, here goes,\" Lassiter said<br />\nwhen he finished baiting his rig. I watched him<br />\nbring that long pole back over his shoulder and<br />\nsnap it forward in one quick motion. It was a<br />\nbeautiful cast, and I had the feeling it was a bit<br />\nfarther than any of the ones I had seen Curtis<br />\nmake. But that might have been because the wind<br />\nwas blowing so hard, and it was tough to see things<br />\nclearly.<br />\n\"Nice,\" I said, reaching for the<br />\nsmall mullet I had wrapped up in newspaper in the<br />\npocket of my raincoat. I was kind of hoping that<br />\nCurtis might break into one of his stories about the<br />\nold land pirates\u2014like he always did when there<br />\nwere just the two of us out there. But he didn't say<br />\nanything. Maybe it was because of Lassiter, who<br />\nreally didn't look like the type that would take to<br />\nstories. So, I Just went ahead and unwrapped the<br />\nmullet, being careful to put the newspaper back in<br />\nmy pocket, because I didn't like to see litter all<br />\nover the beach. Ever since I was a kid, I liked to sit<br />\nout on the edge of the surf and stare at the clean<br />\ncontinued on page 2<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE MARYLAND INTER\u2014UNIVERSITY WRITING SEMINARS/OCTOBER '72<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\ncontinued from page 1<br />\n<br />\nwhite sand, stretching from north to Kitty Hawk<br />\nto way south of Nag's Head.<br />\nCurtis was looking up at the<br />\nclouds and they were moving across the sky like<br />\nhuge curls of smoke. I thought maybe he was<br />\nlooking for gulls, which were supposed to be a<br />\ngood sign for fishing--especially when they were<br />\nsitting on the water.<br />\n\"You know something, Cap'n,\"<br />\nhe finally said, \"without all those scars you look a<br />\nlittle like my son. You can handle a rig jest like he<br />\nuseta.\"<br />\nThat was the first time I ever<br />\nheard that Curtis had a son. In fact, I didn't even<br />\nknow he'd been married, because he lived alone<br />\nand there weren't any pictures or anything in his<br />\ncottage--like people always keep when they have a<br />\nfamily.<br />\n\"Yessir, he was only sixteen when<br />\nhe took off for the war--about the same age as this<br />\nboy here,\" Curtis was saying. \"Never came back<br />\nthough an' never did find his body washed up. I<br />\nknow 'cause I been out here 'most every mornin'<br />\nsince the day he left.\"<br />\n\"The war's been over a long time,<br />\nCurtis,\" Lassiter said.<br />\n\"Yep, but ya never know what<br />\nthe sea'll cough up. She's a strange one, all right,<br />\nbut she's beautiful an' I wouldn't leave her for<br />\nnothin'.\"<br />\n\"Well, Curtis,\" Lassiter said,<br />\ntaking a deep breath like he had something<br />\nimportant to say, and was waiting for the right<br />\nmoment when his words would have the most<br />\neffect, \"everybody loses something during the war.<br />\nBut war is something that has to be. We've got to<br />\naccept it and make the best of it\u2014just like we do<br />\nwith everything else.\"<br />\nI looked up at Lassiter's face and<br />\nin God's name could have put<br />\nwhat<br />\nwondered<br />\nthem there. They were just plain awful, them scars.<br />\n\"Never had the chance to fight,\"<br />\nCurtis was saying, \"cause a m'bum leg. Never<br />\ncould walk without a limp. Nope, it was m'boy<br />\nwho went.\"<br />\nCurtis always did hobble around,<br />\nsometimes wrapping his leg up in a bandage--and he<br />\nalways seemed to be fussing with it, as if it really<br />\ngave hime some pain. But it sure didn't keep him<br />\nfrom being the best damn fisherman on the Outer<br />\nBanks.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL<br />\nBOARD<br />\n<br />\n\"How did you mess up your leg,<br />\nCurtis?\" Lassiter asked him, but the old man<br />\nwasn't listening. He was staring down at the<br />\npatches of seaweed and broken shells that were<br />\nscattered all over the beach. The rain had started--a<br />\nslow drizzle at first, but I knew it wouldn't be long<br />\nbefore that pock-marked sand would be as smooth<br />\nas glass.<br />\n\"Guess we'd better reel it in,\"<br />\nLassiter said.<br />\n\"Yessir. M'boy' and me useta<br />\nstand out here 'most every day,\" the old man was<br />\nsaying. \"Useta throw a Hopkins out for the big<br />\nblues off Or'gon Inlet\u2014do some crabbin'<br />\nmaybe--'round them old hulks the pirates left.<br />\nYessir, got some bigguns outta them wrecks. An'<br />\nthe drums! ya shoulda seen them drums we picked<br />\noff the bottom on cut bait. Once we even got us a<br />\nshark--a nine-an'-a-half-footer. On eighteen pound<br />\nline. I'm tellin' ya. Them were the days.\"<br />\nThe rain was really coming down<br />\nnow, turning the blue denim almost black, and it<br />\nwas streaming off the brim of the Navy cap and<br />\nsplashing on to the old Langley.<br />\n\"Yessir,jest had nothin' to do but<br />\ngo fishin'Lassiter didn't say anything. He<br />\nwas packing his gear as fast as he could and trying<br />\nto get the hell out of the rain. Instead of a<br />\npen-knife or something, he used a short bayonet to<br />\ntear the bait off his hooks. Most people took their<br />\ntime, trying to save some of it to use again\u2014but not<br />\nLassiter. He moved fast and he butchered what was<br />\nleft of the worms, then cut his leader off and<br />\nshoved it into his ammunition box. He was a mean<br />\none, all right, and he slammed things around like<br />\nhe had a grudge against them.<br />\n-\"What're you looking at, boy?\"<br />\nhe said to me. \"Don't you know enough to come<br />\nin out of the rain?\"<br />\nI didn't rightly know how to<br />\nanswer him, so I just looked into the surf--into<br />\nthose big curls that folded over each other and<br />\nthen came smashing down on the beach. And the<br />\nsound of it was just humming in my ears like there<br />\nwas nothing else in the world. It made me think<br />\nabout those times I had walked on the beach<br />\nalone\u2014just after dawn\u2014when the porpoises were in<br />\nclose and diving in and out of the swells--just<br />\nrolling up and down like they were on a circus ride.<br />\nThey were big, beautiful things--those babies--and<br />\nsometimes I even felt I had spotted an albino<br />\nleading the school. But I guess it was just the<br />\nlight--with the sun coming up and coloring<br />\neverything the way it did.<br />\n<br />\nI thought about Edward Teach,<br />\nslipping in and out of his hideout down in<br />\nOcracoke with boatloads of treasure, and the land<br />\npirates around Jockey's Ridge who used to walk<br />\nhorses with lanterns around their necks across the<br />\ncrest of that big mountain of sand, and how'ships<br />\nat sea would think the lighn were a safAarbOr and<br />\nrun themselves aground and get looted and burned.<br />\n\"Good-bye,\" Lassiter said and<br />\ntook off up the beach. I watched Curtis turn and<br />\nstare after him. Lassiter was something in that<br />\nhood, walking toward the wall of dunes on the<br />\nedge of the beach, slowly iading out of sight until<br />\nthere was nothing to see but the slate-colored roofs<br />\nof the cottages.<br />\nCurtis rested his rod against his<br />\nshoulder and wiped his forehead with the back of<br />\nhis hand. He didn't seem to know that I was still<br />\nthere. I watched, somewhat confused, as he picked<br />\nup his pole with his one hand and began<br />\nrunning\u2014rather slowly at first, but with a good deal<br />\nof effort--toward the spot where Lassiter had just<br />\ndisappeared. Then the old man's legs were m oving<br />\nwith long even strides, and after a short distance.<br />\nhe stopped and turned around and that's when he<br />\nnoticed that I was still there.<br />\nI kind of let my eyes' drop and<br />\nstarted to fumble with the ball of newspaper in nlY<br />\npocket, thinking that the rain was actually letting<br />\nup a bit. Curtis turned around again and just<br />\nstarted to walk slowly away, dragging that bum le<br />\nof his behind him. Even at that distance he still<br />\nlooked a little like Edward Teach, or maybe one 01<br />\nhis companions, at the least.<br />\nAfter that, Curtis kind of kept te<br />\nhimself, but I guess maybe it was my fault because<br />\nI really didn't go out of my way to look him up. I'<br />\ncould have been because I didn't do much fishin<br />\nanymore\u2014or maybe it was because I thought I 110<br />\nheard most of the stories he knew anyway.<br />\n(for<br />\n<br />\nB. M.

Ribeiro<br />\nWhile I was searching for a pencil in my cousin's<br />\ndrawers, beneath some old notebooks embellished<br />\nWith doodles and names'of couples that probably<br />\nhad long drifted aprt, I found a photograph of that<br />\nsame girl I had seen that day. She was knelling in<br />\nsome sand with her small hands firmly placed'on<br />\nherthighs ,head tilted slightly to the right,,\u00a707 that<br />\nher hair fell across the left side of her face-, leaving<br />\nOnly her small,rigid nose, glossy right eye beaming<br />\nwith uncertainty, and thick lips obscurely holding<br />\na limbo between a definite smile and a plain<br />\nvacuum of expression. ill covered up her mouth it<br />\nappeared that with her right eye she was crying,<br />\nbut if I took my hand away from her mouth it<br />\nseemed that her lips were on the verge of forming a<br />\nsinile, or maybe she had just seen something that<br />\ncaused her to loose her smile, like the photograph<br />\nof the waves I took once, I couldn't figure out if<br />\nthey were coming in or receeding out. Her skin<br />\nseemed to reflect that brownish glint from her eye;<br />\nIlre I could detect a consistancy of emotion that<br />\nWas absent or hidden in all of her other features.<br />\nfier breasts were ,small, almost invisible underneath<br />\nher loose black blouse. In the distance there was a<br />\ntall branchless tree like a telephone pole, leaning<br />\nSlightly towards the left giving the impression that<br />\nshe not the .tree was leaning in the wrong direction,<br />\nand there were large rocks and boulders gray and<br />\nsnlooth.

My glance darted between both of<br />\nthem, settling on the tiles between them. I paused.<br />\n<br />\nAnd I pulled my head back in, feeling<br />\nthe possibilities once again pan out in all<br />\ndirection. I tried capturing that iamge of her sitting<br />\non that crumbling seat, decaying even with the<br />\nweight of her samll body; indifferent, feeling the<br />\nsupport beneath her bend and sagg. I remembered<br />\nthe closet and a wave of indolence crept through<br />\nmy limbs, as I looked at the separate piles, I begain<br />\nswelling with naseua, smelling the insectiside and<br />\nmothballs I had put in earlier. Inadvertantly I<br />\ngrabbed the small icon and layed down on the bed<br />\nleaving my feet sticking out in mid-air like chances.<br />\nMy eyes facing the ceiling, noticing the way the<br />\nshadows dirfited apart as the curtains swayed with<br />\nthe_ wind. Faintly, I heard their conversation, like a<br />\ntypewriter going late at night in a different room,<br />\none can hear it but who can decipher the message<br />\nby just listening to the incessant clicking and<br />\nringing, so ruminating with the icon's head dancing<br />\nbetween my teeth, it was the silences that told me<br />\nthe most, like the shadows they would outline the<br />\nvoid, and it was those verbal shadows wavering in<br />\nthat afternoon a floor below me that told me what<br />\nwas there.<br />\n-What is it?-Come down I have someone to introduce you to.He looked at her but my gaze instead moved<br />\ntowards him.<br />\n-Well, now I can't come down cause I'm cleaning<br />\nout some stuff.- He stared for a moment, and then<br />\ndecided to introduce me from there. So then, I<br />\nknew her. I tried looking at her for an instant, but<br />\ninstead I saw more of my dangling than her<br />\nexpression. She strained to the right as if to look<br />\naround the clump of hair, and shook her head with<br />\nacknowledgement and crossed her legs.<br />\n-Well, I'll come down in a couple of minutes as<br />\nsoon as I finish straightening out this room.They had dispersed. Maybe. They weren't where<br />\nthey were before. As I strolled out to the kitchen I<br />\nran into nobody, but the lights were on, etiolating<br />\nthe white walls, and the furniture was sitting as if<br />\nin anticipation for something: the brown sofa like<br />\nan anxious circus bear waiting to walk under some<br />\nass and invite it to sit down, the delicate designs on<br />\nthe Persian rug awaiting for the splotches' and<br />\nmuddy, feet to complicate the original logiC, the<br />\nashtrays ready to serve as the smothering ground<br />\nfor lipstick stained butts and if necessary cigars,<br />\ntoothpicks and bubblegum. They knew something<br />\nI didn't, In the kitchen the sunlight made<br />\neverything more bearable, almost as if the natural<br />\nlight could restore every' thing back into its proper<br />\n<br />\nTHE MARYLAND INTER\u2014UNIVERSITY WRITING SEMINARS/OCTOBER '7;<br />\n<br />\nperspective. My mouth still had that funny<br />\nafter-taste, sick syrup lagging at every corner. I sat<br />\ndown by the kitchen table. Sand. Crumbs from the<br />\nmorning bread and splotch of cream and coffee<br />\nprobably spilled by my cousins sleeping lips. A<br />\nboat.<br />\nI took a boat and drove clear through the still<br />\nwaters cold as a plastic table cloth, and on the<br />\nbeach I would design one road first and then<br />\ncontinue to add untill the sea see-sawed over me<br />\ndevelopments and then the small birds dodging the<br />\nspumes would, in their jerky manner, trample over<br />\nthe few remaining roads, but with sand on my lips<br />\nI closed my lids and let myself go to sleep. No, the<br />\ndreams had started long ago and this one, or which<br />\none (?) everyone now, the dream within a dream<br />\ntied out since the day I plopped out<br />\nthat had<br />\nof the womb, hut nothing could be kept from<br />\nthose dreams. f';., legs like my dream had extended<br />\nall the way across the table. She walked in casually,<br />\nsilently as if like the furniture in anticipation and<br />\nsat down. Dreams halted and intertwined She was<br />\nwaiting for my voice. I could almost trace her<br />\nthoughts winding and crashing against the ones<br />\nthat composed my being. All to ignite. Only words<br />\nwere needed to create and destroy, so we talked.<br />\n- I was writing a story about you.-Nothing-You shouldn't think, just dream that's how you<br />\n<br />\nget in trouble.She nodded or replied I can't remember.-I remember that the only problems I've ever had<br />\ncome from there. A cavitation from the work going<br />\non the possibilities tied down to one, or just the<br />\nopposite you can't leave them alone you work<br />\nthem out too many ways never hitting on the right<br />\none. I think so- A twitch from her lips and she<br />\nflicked her eyelashes. I scratched my belly and felt<br />\nmy nubbs. All I got was a faint hint of movement<br />\nfrom up there, it was like looking into water and<br />\nonly being able to see at the most a dull blurry<br />\nimage more like an inky diffused color wavering<br />\nundecidedly. In futility I made some remarks<br />\nconcerning the .signifigance of silence, but her reply<br />\nescapes me. It was nothing witty, but just flat,<br />\nsomething that would be impossible to answer and<br />\nfor that matter remember. I could only grasp her at<br />\nthe moment, so now I wonder if she was there or<br />\nnot or if I was writing this about her, or that.<br />\nWhen I was about to finish the novel the maid<br />\ncalled me to the phone. I grabbed a card from<br />\nsome playing cards that were sprawled at the edge<br />\nof the desk; a nine or six of diamonds, I think. It<br />\nwas dark beside the phone. My feet propped up on<br />\nthe small coffee table. From the hall a thin stream<br />\nof light floated in and hit the curtains and shades<br />\nsetting up a weird combination of waves and dark<br />\nridges;typical faces, long drawn out like El Grecos.<br />\n<br />\n-Yes, hello-Hello, it's me rememberIt was her.<br />\n\u2014Yeah,iunny though, I was never expecting a call<br />\nfrom you-Well, I felt like seeing you-You're not seeing me are you?-Well, notwiddled the cord between my fingers. I could hear<br />\ndinner being made below; dishes clanging, water<br />\ngoing on and off, and the tinkling of dog tags<br />\nprobably as the dog circled around his dish waiting<br />\nfor his meal. The curtains wavered with a small<br />\nbreeze disintating the faces and putting up limbs<br />\nand parts of bodies, all in motion.<br />\nWe were outside beside the old shed, painting the<br />\nweather beaten boards when I saw her in the<br />\ndistance, standing near the corner; the blue of her<br />\nslacks pinned against the gray sky. Only her slacks<br />\nstood out, otherwise it was all fuzzy; her hair, face,<br />\nbody, and arms, but the day remains clear and<br />\nunaffected by the time elapsed. She remained<br />\nshuffling about as some cars passed by her, but<br />\nalways looking in our direction, not at us, I<br />\nthought at the time, but in our direction as if she<br />\nwere trying to recognize us. The paint on the shed<br />\nwas dry and flakey and as I ran my hand down the<br />\nsurface bits the size of potato chips crumbled off<br />\nand taken by the slight breeze floated a couple of<br />\nfeet away from the can of paint. A couple of<br />\nspiders scrambled out of the edge and ran across tothe center of the board. It wasn't wise to come out<br />\nin the open, running in a wild panic across such a<br />\nwide surface. They could be swatted down by<br />\nanything, and my cousin's brush came down on<br />\nthem, when the brush came up their bodies were<br />\nstruggling, squirming against the thick paint,<br />\ntransformed to the same color as their alarm: red.<br />\nThe large one had three of its legs torn from its<br />\nbody, but it moved even with more determination<br />\nthan the other one who had been swallowed by a<br />\nlarge red drop. The spider was in the middle like a<br />\nburnt log in a kindling fire; he seemed to accept his<br />\nfate and relax as the red oozed over the remaining<br />\nblackness of his frail body and disappear leaving a<br />\ndistinct outline like a fossil. For me, the smell was<br />\nstrong enough to kill, piercing and crashing against<br />\nmy nostrils like a drug it would penetrate to the<br />\nbone, pinning me against the flat land of time, but<br />\naway and suspended from everything that moved<br />\nin that spiraling direction, away from that<br />\nbeginning, and my cousin hadn't even noticed the<br />\nstruggle; he was over to the other edge, stroking in<br />\nrhythm with his breathing, his dark hair in his eyes,<br />\nhis expression-calm, and his ragged pants marked<br />\nwith red stains. All this time the one without the<br />\nthree legs had crawled away from them and was zig<br />\nzaging down the board leaving a faint line like a<br />\nriver on a map, it was then when I looked up and<br />\nnoticed she wasn't at the corner anymore, and my<br />\nbrush was getting dry.<br />\nE.

He<br />\nIs interested primarily in helping<br />\nand working with studnets, both<br />\nm an administrative capacity and<br />\nmore casually.<br />\nHe finds Hopkins \"a<br />\nfascinating school\" and is<br />\nextremely impressed with<br />\nstudent interest in the University,<br />\nespecially housing.\"<br />\nHeist brings refreshing<br />\nenthusiasm and energy to the<br />\nlong entangled subject of student<br />\nhousing. He is the first individual<br />\nto be appointed solely as Dean<br />\nof Housing, and this in itself<br /><br />\nmakes him confident that he can<br />\nguide most major problems and<br />\ndisputes to the \"correct route<br />\nwithout having them sit in<br />\nlimbo.\"<br />\nLarry Denton served as the<br />\nDirector of Housing last year, but<br />\nwhat with his numerous other<br />\nadministrative posts he found<br />\nhimself in what Heist describes<br />\nad an \"abominable position.\"<br />\nAs the new Director of<br />\nHousing, Peter Heist has already<br />\nbegun to focus on two major<br />\nareas of concern. The first of<br />\nthese is the development of the<br />\ncapital improvements program<br />\nfor student apartment buildings,<br />\nand the second are long and short<br />\nterm programs for student<br />\nhousing in general.<br />\nFalling under the second<br />\ncategory are a number of<br />\nsuggestions for improved and<br />\nexpanded student housing. These<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nex lecture sertes<br /><br />\nto begin at Hopkins<br />\nA series of six lectures<br />\nentitled Human Reproduction<br />\nand Humanity sponsored by the<br />\nStudent Health Service will begin<br />\nIn Shriver Hall on Thursday<br />\nafternoon at 4 P.M. The lectures<br />\nwill be bi-weekly and will deal<br />\nWith such topics as the<br />\nPhysiology of the reproductive<br />\nsystem and birth control.<br />\nThe lectures will be delivered<br />\nby members of the Department<br />\nof Gynecology and Obstetrics of<br />\nthe Hopkins Medical School. Dr.<br />\nTheodore.<br />\nKing, Chairman of the<br />\nde partment and principal in the<br />\nest ablishment of the series,<br />\ne mphasized that the series \"is an<br />\ne ducational accompaniment to<br />\nthe gy ne cologica1 services offered<br />\nat the Student Health Center.\"<br />\n\"We'd like many men to come<br />\nas well,\" added King, \"and if we<br />\nget enough response we can get a<br />\nurologist in here<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\nThe degree of response to the<br />\nserels, King noted, would affect<br /><br />\nits future. \"This would make a<br />\nreally nice forerunner for a<br />\ncourse on Health and Hygiene,\"<br />\nhe added.<br />\nDr. Roy Chesnut, Director of<br />\nStudent Health Services and<br />\nanother founder of the lecture<br />\nseries noted that \"this might well<br />\nbecome an annual thing.\"<br />\nChesnut explained that the<br />\nseries was set up as a result of the<br />\ndemand for gynecological<br />\nservices on campus. \"Requests<br />\nwe heard from girls on campus<br />\nwere that educational material<br />\nwas needed in the area of<br />\ngynecological matters,\" Chesnut<br />\nstated.<br />\nBoth King and Chesnut<br />\nemphasized that the lectures<br />\nwould concentrate on practical<br />\nmatters of physiology. \"We're<br />\nnot sexologists,\" explained King,<br />\n\"We're gynecologists. We just<br />\nwant to make sure that everyone<br />\nhas the same base knowledge<br />\nabout their own bodies.\"<br /><br />\ninclude the question of whether<br />\nor not the University should buy<br />\nrowhouses for students, the<br />\npossibility of another apartment<br />\nhouse on campus or in the<br />\nneighboring area, and the topic<br />\nof guaranteed leasing which<br />\ninvolves university leasing of<br />\nhousing to a landlord who in turn<br />\nwould lease them to students.<br />\nCommenting on these<br />\nproposals, Heist observed,\"There<br />\nare many things on the fire, and<br />\nin another two or three weeks<br />\nwe'll definitely go into<br />\nsomething.\"<br />\nThe capital improvements<br />\nprogram, part of the University's<br />\nbudget to housing, attempts to<br />\nwork with tenants to \"make<br />\nstudent apartments more<br />\nfunctional.\"<br />\n\"Every apartment should have<br />\nkitchen facilities, including a<br />\ncounter,\" Heist commented in<br />\nreference to the capital<br />\nimprovements program.<br />\nHeist's opinion of the dorms is<br />\nthat they are, indeed, little better<br />\nthan the \"cell-blocks\" they are<br />\ncommonly likened to.<br />\nHe proposes \"breaking the<br />\ncinder 'blocks up into a more<br />\nhomey arrangement.\" A feasible<br />\nway of doing this, he suggested,<br />\nmight be the formation of suites<br />\nfor several students who would<br />\nhave their own rooms, but share<br /><br />\nDorms are little better than \"cell-blocks\".<br />\nkitchen, living room and bath<br />\nfacilities.<br />\nBut until a way can be found<br />\nto make up for the lost bed space<br />\nthat would result from such an<br />\ninnovation, Heist feels the<br />\nfreshmen and upperclass dorms<br />\nwill remain pretty much the<br />\nsame.<br />\nRather<br />\nHeist thinks that many<br />\nstudents would prefer living in<br />\nuniversity housing on or close to<br />\ncampus rather than commute<br />\nfrom various parts of the city.<br />\n\"If we had 300 additional<br />\nplaces available near the campus,<br />\nI'm sure we could fill them<br /><br />\nBidding begins on Union<br /><br />\nJohn McElwee<br /><br />\nThe plans for the Hopkins<br />\nStudent Union have been<br />\nfinalized and bidding began<br />\nyesterday for the construction<br />\ncontract.<br />\nThe plans were turned in and<br />\nreviewed on September 26 at a<br />\nmeeting of architect Donald<br />\nSickler and John McElwee,<br />\nDirector of Physical Plant<br />\nPlanning. According to McElwee,<br />\nthere were no major problems<br />\nand Hopkins is now ready to<br />\nchoose a contractor for the $1.3<br />\nmillion project. He stated that<br />\nthese bids will be due on the<br /><br />\nInter-divisional programs supported<br />\nBy PETER GARDNER<br />\nor the academic year<br />\n'71-1972, the Division of Arts<br />\nand<br />\nSciences paid approximately<br />\n75,000 to the Evening College<br />\nin inter visional tuition costs\"<br />\nand to cover the tuition of<br />\nunde<br />\nrgraduates taking Evening<br />\nCollege courses.<br />\nInter-divisional costs are paid<br />\nbetwe n,e<br />\nall the divisions of the<br />\n-uiv ersity. \"This means, for<br />\nexamPle,,<br />\nthat when a student<br />\ngoes to the<br />\nEvening College, Arts<br />\n:Id Sciences is charged a certain<br />\n\"\"iount for that student,\"<br />\nep,x.

He<br />\nenjoys living \"in a larger city\"<br />\nand is especially pleased with his<br />\ncomfortable ground floor office<br />\nand living quarters in Wolman<br />\nHall. \"They offered me an office<br />\nover at Levering Hall,\" Heist<br />\ngrinned, \"but it seemed<br />\nridiculous since in this place I'm<br />\ncloser to the housing problems<br />\nI'd be removed from over there.\"<br /><br />\nDr. Harry Woolf, Provost .<br />\nstressed that he tdo was \"very<br />\nmuch in favor of inter- divisional<br />\neducation. .<br />\n\u2022 He explained that he would<br />\nlike to see an increase in<br />\ninterchangeS within the<br />\nUniversity, stressing that \"the<br />\nflow of students throughout the<br />\nsystem should be with a<br />\nminimum of restriction.\"<br />\nWoolf stated that it would not<br />\nbe wise to eliminate the<br />\ninter-divisional costs between<br />\ndivisions where the flow of<br />\nstudents was fairly equal. He<br />\ncommented that the charges<br />\nshould not be cut out for they<br />\nare a way of recording<br />\ninter-division enrollments.<br />\n\"Bookkeeping and records are<br />\nrequired,\" Woolf stated, \"if only<br />\nas a record of what the cost is.\"<br />\nHe stressed that the University<br />\nmust know what these programs<br />\n\u2022<br />\nare costing.<br />\n.13.q.atort\u2014<br />\nD<br /><br />\nPresident for Homewood<br />\nDivisions, said that he feels fairly<br />\nrelaxed about the issue of<br />\ninter-divisional costs.<br />\nBenton stated, \"We should<br />\nencourage inter-divisional<br />\nexchanges is there is a real<br />\nreason.\" He said that if there was<br />\na honest reason for a student to<br />\ntake an Evening College course,<br />\n\"this is a perfectly legitimate use<br />\nof University facilities.\"<br />\nBut he stressed that the<br />\ndivision supplying the services<br />\nahouls receive payment for them.<br />\n\"This is only fair,\" he asserted.<br />\nBenton explained that the net<br />\nflow was actually very small. The<br />\ntotal tuition for Arts and<br />\nSciences he estimated at $4.7<br />\nmillion. \"The outflow of<br />\n$75,000.\" he stated, \"is<br />\ntherefore only a little over 1%.\"<br />\nBenton indicated there was little<br />\nneed for alarm, especially<br />\nconsidering that \"it's all in the<br />\n\u2014<br />\n-\u2022 \u2014<br /><br />\ntwenty-sixth of this month.<br />\nThe U.S. Department of<br />\nHousing and Urban Development<br />\n(HUD), which will provide a part<br />\nof the funding for the Union,<br />\nmust approve the plans and the<br />\ncompany prior to the start of<br />\nbuilding construction. McElwee<br />\nremarked, in reference to HUD's<br />\napproval procedure, \"They<br />\nreview the drawings, and they<br />\nreview the bids to make sure that<br />\nwe got the best one.\"<br />\nThe Plant Planning Director<br />\nsaid that Hopkins would try to<br />\nget HUD's approval of everything<br />\nexcept the construction<br />\ncompany, while the various<br />\ncontractors were bidding for the<br />\njob. He is hoping that by the end<br />\nof October a construction<br />\ncompany will be chosen and the<br />\narchitectural plans and other<br />\nincidentals will have been<br />\napproved by HUD.<br />\nConcerning the completion<br />\ndate, McElwee stated that the<br />\nfoundation is coming along well<br />\nand it should be ready in six<br />\nweeks, at which time a<br />\nconstruction company will be<br />\nchosen.<br />\nThere were a number of<br />\nproblems with the foundation<br />\nbut McElwee said that the<br />\nunderground gas problem was<br />\ntaken care of and, alluding to the<br />\ntelephone trunk line that was<br />\nrunning through the excavation<br />\nsite, he stated that all the lines<br />\nhave been rerouted temporarily<br />\nor otherwise and are out of the<br />\nway of construction.<br />\nBidding for the construction<br />\nof the Union was originally to<br />\nbegin approximately September<br />\n11 but the plans were turned in<br />\ntwo weeks late by architect<br />\n.Sickler.<br /><br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nday editor<br />\nmanaging editors<br />\nphotography editors<br />\nfeatures editor<br />\nsports editors<br /><br />\nDon Lassus, Richard Waring<br />\nR H.

Eisenhower announced that there would be<br />\nno tuition increases during his term as interim<br />\npresident. He did state upon his retirement that his<br />\nsuccessor would almost certainly have to impose a rise<br />\nin tuition. True to that prediction, Steven Muller<br />\nannounced last Friday that he would ask the Board of<br />\nTrustees for an increase in tuition of at least $300 at<br />\ntheir meeting this month in Williamsburg, Virginia.<br />\nWhile it is obvious that the University needs to<br />\nobtain more money from some source in order to<br />\nbalance its budget by 1974, there is some question as<br />\nto why the students should be expected to provide the<br />\nbulk of the money. A little quick arithmetic shows<br />\nthat 2200 students all paying, from some source, $300<br />\nmore in tuition will provide $660,000 in additional<br />\nfunds, very close to the total expected budget deficit<br />\nof $750,000 for the Arts and Sciences division this<br />\nyear. This increase will place a real hardship on the<br />\nalready hard-pressed student, especially the junior or<br />\nsophomore who cannot transfer to another, less<br />\nexpensive institution before next year, who will have<br />\nno choice except to pay the higher rate, or drop out of<br />\nschool altogether.<br />\nUnless President Muller can come up with facts and<br />\nfigures to back up his proposal at tonight's Student<br />\nCouncil meeting, there is no reason students should be<br />\nexpected to pay anything more than $2700 for a year<br />\nof a Hopkins education.<br /><br />\nWOE HOME,POWs!<br /><br />\nRobert Ruby<br />\nEd Brethauer, Mark Leifer<br /><br />\nassociate editor<br />\ncirculation manager<br /><br />\nSue Woolhiser<br />\nNancy Forgione<br /><br />\nproduction manager<br />\nClayton Buick<br />\nphoto-production manager<br />\nBill Waters<br />\nstaff writers:Lloyd Berkowitz, Richard Bland,<br />\nMark Borsi, John<br />\nBortz, Joe Cantor, Sharon Feldstein, Martin<br />\nFrench, Peter<br />\nGardner, Linda Grace, Jeff Greene, Arthur<br />\nKougell, Andy<br />\nLashley, Herbert Loveless, Tom Nathan, Jerry<br />\nNeser, Bob<br />\nPaulus, Allen Short, Alvin Stein, Mitch Tenzer<br />\nsports staff: Mike Bereston, Steve Brown, Nils<br />\nBrubaker, Robert<br />\nFreundlich, Gerry Greenfield, Barry Kemelhor, Chuck<br />\nSlonin,<br />\nMike Slowinski,Lawrence Weinstein<br />\nproduction staff: Susan Blum, Mark Gallagher, Dick Scholz,<br />\nMark Secor<br />\nthe news-lett. is published twice each week during the school year by the<br />\nstudents of the johns hopkins university, homewood campus, baltimore,<br />\nmaryland. editorial and businesscorrespondence should be directed to<br />\nbox 1230, the johns hopkins university, baltimore, maryland 21218;<br />\ntelephone 301-366-3300, extension 1308, subscriptions $8 per annum.<br />\nmember columbia scholastic press association.<br /><br />\nletters to the editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was going to ignore Mike Siegel's first<br />\ntirade against women at Hopkins. After I<br />\nwas told that he had been denied a room<br />\nin Wolman Hall this year, I dismissed his<br />\nargument against women securing housing<br />\npriority as personal and understandably<br />\nbitter, based on his own experiences<br />\ndealing with a school that considers itself<br />\nbenevolent if it gives anyone a place to<br />\nlive. Later, I advised him to organize the<br />\nmale students, much like we had done<br />\namong women, to gain housing reforms.<br />\nThe answer to room shortage here is not<br />\nto denounce Hopkins women for<br />\nguaranteeing themselves a roof over their<br />\nheads. Instead Siegal and others who<br />\nrightfully feel the way he does should<br />\nemulate us to gain victory, too. The<br />\ntrouble at Hopkins is that everybody<br />\ngrumbles a lot and thinks about<br />\ntransferring , but that is as far as activism<br />\ngoes.

I am not clear on the<br />\nNews-Letter's policy of accepting articles,<br />\nbut if you editors out there are going to<br />\ngive Siegel a column and not call it<br />\nOpinion, then I believe it is your<br />\nresponsibility to verify his facts.<br />\nI did not tell Siegel in Mafia-like<br />\nfashion that we were trying to \"contact\"<br />\nhim. Instead, in trying to be friendly<br />\n(indeed, I knew whom he was\u2014no one<br />\nhad to shout in my ear that he was the<br />\nBad Guy, nor did I suddenly become<br />\nhostile after unmasking his identity in<br />\nmelodramatic Zorro style), I mentioned<br />\nthat I would have invited him to the<br />\nmeetin, if I had known where he lived. I<br />\nmust admit that I didn't try very hard to<br />\nlocate him, so let's dispense with the<br />\nmyth that my henchmen had prowled the<br />\navenues stalking him out. We had more<br />\nessential things to do on the eve of a<br /><br />\nthe Women's Center because we want<br />\nfemale students to be an integral part of<br />\nthe community. This is in direct contrast<br />\nto Siegel's portrayal of us as man-eating<br />\nAmazons, determined to be Hopkins<br />\nseparatists. Besides the fact we have male<br />\nmembers within our ranks, we women<br />\nalso have among us the president of the<br />\nJewish Students Association, the<br />\nrepresentative on the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies, several teaching<br />\nassistants, and two program directors of<br />\nthe gymnasium. In other words, we are<br />\nnot only women activists, we are students<br />\nactivists concerned with the general state<br />\nof Hopkins. Thus concerned, we want to<br />\nimprove that status of women here, so<br />\nthat females will want to come to<br />\nHopkins in increasing number. With the<br />\ntrend swinging back to women's colleges<br />\n(or at least universities with more equal<br />\nmale-female ratios), Hopkins will have to<br />\nshow itself to be a hell of a lot more<br />\nattractive to women if it wants a steadily<br />\n\u2022F.<br /><br />\nc5 CVC,<br /><br />\nto improve our status, then the Siegels<br /><br />\nto establish a hierarchy resembling the<br />\nStudent Council, in the belief that each<br /><br />\nshudder. Women demanding and receiving<br />\nbetter health service and housing facilities<br />\nremind Hopkins men how inactive they<br />\nhave been. Instead of experimenting with<br />\nsimilar \"student poser,\" they smear us<br />\nand retreat back to their books. What<br />\ncollege radicals.<br />\nI am more disturbed with Siegel's<br />\nsecond article as printed in Friday's<br />\nNews-Letter (September 29). Aside from<br />\nmy ideological differences with what he<br />\ntried to say, I protest its journalistic<br />\nmerit. The problem was not so much'that<br />\nit was written poorly (I can excuse that as<br />\na rush to meet a deadline) nor that it did<br />\nnot deliver its intended message, but that<br />\nit dared cloak itself in the name of satire.<br />\nLast year, the News-Letter printed a<br />\nnumber of bright articles dealing<br />\nsatiracally with issues such as the term<br />\npaper controversy and book store thefts.<br />\nThat writer succeeded because he was<br />\nable to sort out humor from the truth.<br />\nThat was satire. Siegel, on the other hand,<br />\ncould not find such absurdities at our<br />\nfirst Women's Center meeting; so,<br />\ndesperate to write a funny piece, he tried<br />\nto create a humorous situation from what<br /><br />\nof us is as important as the other.<br />\nUnderstandably, then, we are having<br />\ntrouble ascertaining who was the woman<br />\nwho kept points in her conversation with<br />\nSiegel. And since he sat 'way in the back<br />\nof the room all evening, he did not really<br />\nmingle with us at all. I question when he<br />\nhad the opportunity to be intimidated by<br />\nany of us. He did not ask questions, or<br />\nprovoke discussion. In short, he barely<br />\nopened his mouth in the few hours he<br />\nwas there. Too few of us knew he was<br />\nthere to even try to bother him. And<br />\nreally, in the flush of a successful evening,<br />\nshared by men (they were there, too) and<br />\nwomen, who really cared about Siegel at<br />\nall? I understand why he had to jive<br />\nthrough his article: If you don't really<br />\ncreate dynamic interaction in person,<br />\nimaginatively conjure it all up on paper.<br />\nAs one News-Letter editor advised a<br />\nfriend when he tried out to be a writer in.<br />\nhis freshman year, \"If you don't find<br />\nnews on campus, make up something,<br />\nanyway.\"<br />\nI am growing more and more disturbed<br />\nwith the image of us that is allowed to<br />\nexist at Hopkins.

However, I think I have a a<br />\nnovel perspective on the matter. On many<br />\ntexts purchased at our great Book Center,<br />\nstudents could actually save money by<br />\ntaking them over to the library and<br />\nduplicating them on the Coin-Fax<br />\nmachines, two pages to a copy, then<br />\nreturning them to the Book Center. For<br />\nexample, a four hundred page text would<br />\ntake two hundred nickels, or S10.00, and,<br />\nsay, an hour of one's time. If the text<br />\nsold for $15.00 (a conservative estimate),<br />\nthe student would have found himself<br />\nfive bucks ahead for one hour's work.

He was standing right on the edge of the<br />\nwater, looking like the ghost of Edward Teach<br />\nhimself, even though he was past sixty and a bit<br />\nhunched over. And those weathered sun-browned<br />\nhands of his were sqeezing the cork handle of that<br />\nfamous custom pole with the three big 'eyes'<br />\nspaced away from the grip so's the line could come<br />\n\u00b0ut faster. He always said you could get better<br />\ndistance on your casts with a pole wrapped that<br />\nWay, and I supposed he was right because I never<br />\ndid see anybody beat<br />\nhim.<br />\nHe was standing there beside a<br />\nbucket full of menhaden, chewing on the stub of<br />\nhis corncob pipe--with the bowl turned<br />\nUpsidedown\u2014and moving his bony fingers<br />\nto crank<br />\nthat old, Langley reel. He had<br />\ntold me a dozen<br />\ntimes<br />\nbefore that a Langley was the best in the<br />\n\u00b0rid and that people couldn't get them anymore<br />\nnecause they went out of business just after World<br />\nVV<br />\n,ar II. 01' Curtis probably knew more about<br />\n\"ings than anyone--and if he was to say he had<br />\neen `Hatteress Jack,' You could be pretty damn<br />\niure there really was a white porpoise that guided<br />\nniPs through the rough water around the.Cape.<br />\nAnyway, it was a cold morning<br />\n:<br />\nI'd 'everything was so dark I couldn't hardly tell<br />\nhere the sea ended and the sky began.

The<br />\nwind was up, and coming hard<br />\ne it was going to blow us all the way across Kill<br />\nevil Hills and into Albemarle Sound.<br />\nWell, when I got close enough to<br />\nhurtis, I called out to him, and he looked over his<br />\nee'ulder. But he didn't.answer until I was right up<br />\n,:de him and his bucket of dead menhaden:<br />\ntvell Boy, we got ourselves a Nor'easter blowin'<br />\nit'll be pretty sparse for awhile.

He was wearing an Army<br />\nrain-parka with the hood pulled up over the back<br />\nof his head\u2014and on the side of his face was a mass<br />\nof thick white scars. It was like he was wearing<br />\nhelmet and carrying a spear instead of a fishing<br />\npole, and near as I could tell, there was a rusty<br />\nolive-colored box, an ammunition case, in his other<br />\nhand. He was the man me and Curtis met up at the<br />\npier in Kitty Hawk just the other day, and Curtis<br />\nhad invited him out to do a little bottom-fishing.<br />\nHis name was Lassiter.<br />\n\"Good morning,\" he said when he<br />\ngot up to us, \"I thought the weather might keep an<br />\nold man with a bad leg in bed.\"<br />\nCurtis kind of sneered at him.<br />\n\"Hell, I useta run moonshine in worse than this.\"<br /><br />\nKill Devil Hills<br />\nNumber 1<br />\nNow there were some stories<br />\nabout people who used to run bootleg whiskey<br />\nacross the Sound to the mainland, but I didn't<br />\nknow Curtis had ever done it until right then.<br />\n\"It must have been pretty potent<br />\nstuff,\" Lassiter said.<br />\n\"Enough to kill the devil,\" Curtis<br />\ntold him. \"Fact is, my daddy useta make it back in<br />\nthem days when that strip of ocean out there was<br />\ncalled 'Torpedo Junction'.\"<br />\nCurtis had told me all about that<br />\nbefore\u2014how the Gulf Stream flowed north and the<br />\nLabrador Current south, but right next to each<br />\nother so's the shipping lanes were so close together<br />\nthat the merchantmen passing by were sitting<br />\nducks for the U-Boats. And then the Bankers<br />\nwould always come down to the beach after a<br /><br />\nNortheaster to look at the wreckage and the<br />\nbroken bodies that had washed up. But I didn't<br />\nthink Lassiter had heard the story, so I asked<br />\nCurtis to tell it to him.<br />\n\"Not much a body can tell Mr.<br />\nLassiter about war--'scuse me, I mean `Cap'n'<br />\nLassiter. Why he's got more medals than most I<br />\never knowed.\"<br />\nLassiter sort of smiled as he<br />\nreached down into his ammunition box to get a<br />\ncarton of bloodworms. \"I was just plain lucky,<br />\nCurtis. With the wrong move I could've been<br />\nfertilizer in somebody's backyard.\" He was sliding<br />\none of them creatures on to his hook.<br />\nCurtis scowled, if you could call it<br />\na scowl--the way his mouth tried to curve with the<br />\npipe still in it. \"Too damned expensive,\" he<br />\nmuttered\u2014referring to the worms which had come<br />\nfrom up north-- in Nova Scotia. The way I<br />\nunderstood it, nobody but winos would dig for<br />\nthem, and they were always going on strike<br />\nbecause the Canadian Government kept raising the<br />\nprice of wine. So, by the time the worms got to the<br />\nBanks they weren't exactly cheap. I didn't like<br />\nthem worms much anyway--mainly because they<br />\nwere always crawling around dead things. Curtis<br />\nhardly ever used them either\u2014and, of course, when<br />\nit came to fishing, he knew just about everything.<br />\nThere wasn't a man from Elizabeth City to Cape<br />\nLookout who knew as much as he did--or at least<br />\nthat's the way I felt about it.<br />\n\"Well, here goes,\" Lassiter said<br />\nwhen he finished baiting his rig. I watched him<br />\nbring that long pole back over his shoulder and<br />\nsnap it forward in one quick motion. It was a<br />\nbeautiful cast, and I had the feeling it was a bit<br />\nfarther than any of the ones I had seen Curtis<br />\nmake. But that might have been because the wind<br />\nwas blowing so hard, and it was tough to see things<br />\nclearly.<br />\n\"Nice,\" I said, reaching for the<br />\nsmall mullet I had wrapped up in newspaper in the<br />\npocket of my raincoat. I was kind of hoping that<br />\nCurtis might break into one of his stories about the<br />\nold land pirates\u2014like he always did when there<br />\nwere just the two of us out there. But he didn't say<br />\nanything. Maybe it was because of Lassiter, who<br />\nreally didn't look like the type that would take to<br />\nstories. So, I Just went ahead and unwrapped the<br />\nmullet, being careful to put the newspaper back in<br />\nmy pocket, because I didn't like to see litter all<br />\nover the beach. Ever since I was a kid, I liked to sit<br />\nout on the edge of the surf and stare at the clean<br />\ncontinued on page 2<br /><br />\nTHE MARYLAND INTER\u2014UNIVERSITY WRITING SEMINARS/OCTOBER '72<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\ncontinued from page 1<br /><br />\nwhite sand, stretching from north to Kitty Hawk<br />\nto way south of Nag's Head.<br />\nCurtis was looking up at the<br />\nclouds and they were moving across the sky like<br />\nhuge curls of smoke. I thought maybe he was<br />\nlooking for gulls, which were supposed to be a<br />\ngood sign for fishing--especially when they were<br />\nsitting on the water.<br />\n\"You know something, Cap'n,\"<br />\nhe finally said, \"without all those scars you look a<br />\nlittle like my son. You can handle a rig jest like he<br />\nuseta.\"<br />\nThat was the first time I ever<br />\nheard that Curtis had a son. In fact, I didn't even<br />\nknow he'd been married, because he lived alone<br />\nand there weren't any pictures or anything in his<br />\ncottage--like people always keep when they have a<br />\nfamily.<br />\n\"Yessir, he was only sixteen when<br />\nhe took off for the war--about the same age as this<br />\nboy here,\" Curtis was saying. \"Never came back<br />\nthough an' never did find his body washed up. I<br />\nknow 'cause I been out here 'most every mornin'<br />\nsince the day he left.\"<br />\n\"The war's been over a long time,<br />\nCurtis,\" Lassiter said.<br />\n\"Yep, but ya never know what<br />\nthe sea'll cough up. She's a strange one, all right,<br />\nbut she's beautiful an' I wouldn't leave her for<br />\nnothin'.\"<br />\n\"Well, Curtis,\" Lassiter said,<br />\ntaking a deep breath like he had something<br />\nimportant to say, and was waiting for the right<br />\nmoment when his words would have the most<br />\neffect, \"everybody loses something during the war.<br />\nBut war is something that has to be. We've got to<br />\naccept it and make the best of it\u2014just like we do<br />\nwith everything else.\"<br />\nI looked up at Lassiter's face and<br />\nin God's name could have put<br />\nwhat<br />\nwondered<br />\nthem there. They were just plain awful, them scars.<br />\n\"Never had the chance to fight,\"<br />\nCurtis was saying, \"cause a m'bum leg. Never<br />\ncould walk without a limp.

But it sure didn't keep him<br />\nfrom being the best damn fisherman on the Outer<br />\nBanks.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL<br />\nBOARD<br /><br />\n\"How did you mess up your leg,<br />\nCurtis?\" Lassiter asked him, but the old man<br />\nwasn't listening. He was staring down at the<br />\npatches of seaweed and broken shells that were<br />\nscattered all over the beach. The rain had started--a<br />\nslow drizzle at first, but I knew it wouldn't be long<br />\nbefore that pock-marked sand would be as smooth<br />\nas glass.<br />\n\"Guess we'd better reel it in,\"<br />\nLassiter said.<br />\n\"Yessir.

He<br />\nwas packing his gear as fast as he could and trying<br />\nto get the hell out of the rain.

He moved fast and he butchered what was<br />\nleft of the worms, then cut his leader off and<br />\nshoved it into his ammunition box. He was a mean<br />\none, all right, and he slammed things around like<br />\nhe had a grudge against them.<br />\n-\"What're you looking at, boy?\"<br />\nhe said to me. \"Don't you know enough to come<br />\nin out of the rain?\"<br />\nI didn't rightly know how to<br />\nanswer him, so I just looked into the surf--into<br />\nthose big curls that folded over each other and<br />\nthen came smashing down on the beach. And the<br />\nsound of it was just humming in my ears like there<br />\nwas nothing else in the world. It made me think<br />\nabout those times I had walked on the beach<br />\nalone\u2014just after dawn\u2014when the porpoises were in<br />\nclose and diving in and out of the swells--just<br />\nrolling up and down like they were on a circus ride.<br />\nThey were big, beautiful things--those babies--and<br />\nsometimes I even felt I had spotted an albino<br />\nleading the school. But I guess it was just the<br />\nlight--with the sun coming up and coloring<br />\neverything the way it did.<br /><br />\nI thought about Edward Teach,<br />\nslipping in and out of his hideout down in<br />\nOcracoke with boatloads of treasure, and the land<br />\npirates around Jockey's Ridge who used to walk<br />\nhorses with lanterns around their necks across the<br />\ncrest of that big mountain of sand, and how'ships<br />\nat sea would think the lighn were a safAarbOr and<br />\nrun themselves aground and get looted and burned.<br />\n\"Good-bye,\" Lassiter said and<br />\ntook off up the beach. I watched Curtis turn and<br />\nstare after him. Lassiter was something in that<br />\nhood, walking toward the wall of dunes on the<br />\nedge of the beach, slowly iading out of sight until<br />\nthere was nothing to see but the slate-colored roofs<br />\nof the cottages.<br />\nCurtis rested his rod against his<br />\nshoulder and wiped his forehead with the back of<br />\nhis hand. He didn't seem to know that I was still<br />\nthere. I watched, somewhat confused, as he picked<br />\nup his pole with his one hand and began<br />\nrunning\u2014rather slowly at first, but with a good deal<br />\nof effort--toward the spot where Lassiter had just<br />\ndisappeared. Then the old man's legs were m oving<br />\nwith long even strides, and after a short distance.<br />\nhe stopped and turned around and that's when he<br />\nnoticed that I was still there.<br />\nI kind of let my eyes' drop and<br />\nstarted to fumble with the ball of newspaper in nlY<br />\npocket, thinking that the rain was actually letting<br />\nup a bit. Curtis turned around again and just<br />\nstarted to walk slowly away, dragging that bum le<br />\nof his behind him. Even at that distance he still<br />\nlooked a little like Edward Teach, or maybe one 01<br />\nhis companions, at the least.<br />\nAfter that, Curtis kind of kept te<br />\nhimself, but I guess maybe it was my fault because<br />\nI really didn't go out of my way to look him up. I'<br />\ncould have been because I didn't do much fishin<br />\nanymore\u2014or maybe it was because I thought I 110<br />\nheard most of the stories he knew anyway.<br />\n(for<br /><br />\nB. M.

Ribeiro<br />\nWhile I was searching for a pencil in my cousin's<br />\ndrawers, beneath some old notebooks embellished<br />\nWith doodles and names'of couples that probably<br />\nhad long drifted aprt, I found a photograph of that<br />\nsame girl I had seen that day. She was knelling in<br />\nsome sand with her small hands firmly placed'on<br />\nherthighs ,head tilted slightly to the right,,\u00a707 that<br />\nher hair fell across the left side of her face-, leaving<br />\nOnly her small,rigid nose, glossy right eye beaming<br />\nwith uncertainty, and thick lips obscurely holding<br />\na limbo between a definite smile and a plain<br />\nvacuum of expression. ill covered up her mouth it<br />\nappeared that with her right eye she was crying,<br />\nbut if I took my hand away from her mouth it<br />\nseemed that her lips were on the verge of forming a<br />\nsinile, or maybe she had just seen something that<br />\ncaused her to loose her smile, like the photograph<br />\nof the waves I took once, I couldn't figure out if<br />\nthey were coming in or receeding out. Her skin<br />\nseemed to reflect that brownish glint from her eye;<br />\nIlre I could detect a consistancy of emotion that<br />\nWas absent or hidden in all of her other features.<br />\nfier breasts were ,small, almost invisible underneath<br />\nher loose black blouse. In the distance there was a<br />\ntall branchless tree like a telephone pole, leaning<br />\nSlightly towards the left giving the impression that<br />\nshe not the .tree was leaning in the wrong direction,<br />\nand there were large rocks and boulders gray and<br />\nsnlooth.

My glance darted between both of<br />\nthem, settling on the tiles between them. I paused.<br /><br />\nAnd I pulled my head back in, feeling<br />\nthe possibilities once again pan out in all<br />\ndirection. I tried capturing that iamge of her sitting<br />\non that crumbling seat, decaying even with the<br />\nweight of her samll body; indifferent, feeling the<br />\nsupport beneath her bend and sagg. I remembered<br />\nthe closet and a wave of indolence crept through<br />\nmy limbs, as I looked at the separate piles, I begain<br />\nswelling with naseua, smelling the insectiside and<br />\nmothballs I had put in earlier. Inadvertantly I<br />\ngrabbed the small icon and layed down on the bed<br />\nleaving my feet sticking out in mid-air like chances.<br />\nMy eyes facing the ceiling, noticing the way the<br />\nshadows dirfited apart as the curtains swayed with<br />\nthe_ wind. Faintly, I heard their conversation, like a<br />\ntypewriter going late at night in a different room,<br />\none can hear it but who can decipher the message<br />\nby just listening to the incessant clicking and<br />\nringing, so ruminating with the icon's head dancing<br />\nbetween my teeth, it was the silences that told me<br />\nthe most, like the shadows they would outline the<br />\nvoid, and it was those verbal shadows wavering in<br />\nthat afternoon a floor below me that told me what<br />\nwas there.<br />\n-What is it?-Come down I have someone to introduce you to.He looked at her but my gaze instead moved<br />\ntowards him.<br />\n-Well, now I can't come down cause I'm cleaning<br />\nout some stuff.- He stared for a moment, and then<br />\ndecided to introduce me from there. So then, I<br />\nknew her. I tried looking at her for an instant, but<br />\ninstead I saw more of my dangling than her<br />\nexpression. She strained to the right as if to look<br />\naround the clump of hair, and shook her head with<br />\nacknowledgement and crossed her legs.<br />\n-Well, I'll come down in a couple of minutes as<br />\nsoon as I finish straightening out this room.They had dispersed. Maybe. They weren't where<br />\nthey were before. As I strolled out to the kitchen I<br />\nran into nobody, but the lights were on, etiolating<br />\nthe white walls, and the furniture was sitting as if<br />\nin anticipation for something: the brown sofa like<br />\nan anxious circus bear waiting to walk under some<br />\nass and invite it to sit down, the delicate designs on<br />\nthe Persian rug awaiting for the splotches' and<br />\nmuddy, feet to complicate the original logiC, the<br />\nashtrays ready to serve as the smothering ground<br />\nfor lipstick stained butts and if necessary cigars,<br />\ntoothpicks and bubblegum. They knew something<br />\nI didn't, In the kitchen the sunlight made<br />\neverything more bearable, almost as if the natural<br />\nlight could restore every' thing back into its proper<br /><br />\nTHE MARYLAND INTER\u2014UNIVERSITY WRITING SEMINARS/OCTOBER '7;<br /><br />\nperspective. My mouth still had that funny<br />\nafter-taste, sick syrup lagging at every corner. I sat<br />\ndown by the kitchen table. Sand. Crumbs from the<br />\nmorning bread and splotch of cream and coffee<br />\nprobably spilled by my cousins sleeping lips. A<br />\nboat.<br />\nI took a boat and drove clear through the still<br />\nwaters cold as a plastic table cloth, and on the<br />\nbeach I would design one road first and then<br />\ncontinue to add untill the sea see-sawed over me<br />\ndevelopments and then the small birds dodging the<br />\nspumes would, in their jerky manner, trample over<br />\nthe few remaining roads, but with sand on my lips<br />\nI closed my lids and let myself go to sleep. No, the<br />\ndreams had started long ago and this one, or which<br />\none (?) everyone now, the dream within a dream<br />\ntied out since the day I plopped out<br />\nthat had<br />\nof the womb, hut nothing could be kept from<br />\nthose dreams. f';., legs like my dream had extended<br />\nall the way across the table. She walked in casually,<br />\nsilently as if like the furniture in anticipation and<br />\nsat down. Dreams halted and intertwined She was<br />\nwaiting for my voice. I could almost trace her<br />\nthoughts winding and crashing against the ones<br />\nthat composed my being. All to ignite. Only words<br />\nwere needed to create and destroy, so we talked.<br />\n- I was writing a story about you.-Nothing-You shouldn't think, just dream that's how you<br /><br />\nget in trouble.She nodded or replied I can't remember.-I remember that the only problems I've ever had<br />\ncome from there. A cavitation from the work going<br />\non the possibilities tied down to one, or just the<br />\nopposite you can't leave them alone you work<br />\nthem out too many ways never hitting on the right<br />\none. I think so- A twitch from her lips and she<br />\nflicked her eyelashes. I scratched my belly and felt<br />\nmy nubbs. All I got was a faint hint of movement<br />\nfrom up there, it was like looking into water and<br />\nonly being able to see at the most a dull blurry<br />\nimage more like an inky diffused color wavering<br />\nundecidedly. In futility I made some remarks<br />\nconcerning the .signifigance of silence, but her reply<br />\nescapes me. It was nothing witty, but just flat,<br />\nsomething that would be impossible to answer and<br />\nfor that matter remember. I could only grasp her at<br />\nthe moment, so now I wonder if she was there or<br />\nnot or if I was writing this about her, or that.<br />\nWhen I was about to finish the novel the maid<br />\ncalled me to the phone. I grabbed a card from<br />\nsome playing cards that were sprawled at the edge<br />\nof the desk; a nine or six of diamonds, I think. It<br />\nwas dark beside the phone. My feet propped up on<br />\nthe small coffee table. From the hall a thin stream<br />\nof light floated in and hit the curtains and shades<br />\nsetting up a weird combination of waves and dark<br />\nridges;typical faces, long drawn out like El Grecos.<br /><br />\n-Yes, hello-Hello, it's me rememberIt was her.<br />\n\u2014Yeah,iunny though, I was never expecting a call<br />\nfrom you-Well, I felt like seeing you-You're not seeing me are you?-Well, notwiddled the cord between my fingers. I could hear<br />\ndinner being made below; dishes clanging, water<br />\ngoing on and off, and the tinkling of dog tags<br />\nprobably as the dog circled around his dish waiting<br />\nfor his meal. The curtains wavered with a small<br />\nbreeze disintating the faces and putting up limbs<br />\nand parts of bodies, all in motion.<br />\nWe were outside beside the old shed, painting the<br />\nweather beaten boards when I saw her in the<br />\ndistance, standing near the corner; the blue of her<br />\nslacks pinned against the gray sky. Only her slacks<br />\nstood out, otherwise it was all fuzzy; her hair, face,<br />\nbody, and arms, but the day remains clear and<br />\nunaffected by the time elapsed. She remained<br />\nshuffling about as some cars passed by her, but<br />\nalways looking in our direction, not at us, I<br />\nthought at the time, but in our direction as if she<br />\nwere trying to recognize us. The paint on the shed<br />\nwas dry and flakey and as I ran my hand down the<br />\nsurface bits the size of potato chips crumbled off<br />\nand taken by the slight breeze floated a couple of<br />\nfeet away from the can of paint. A couple of<br />\nspiders scrambled out of the edge and ran across tothe center of the board. It wasn't wise to come out<br />\nin the open, running in a wild panic across such a<br />\nwide surface. They could be swatted down by<br />\nanything, and my cousin's brush came down on<br />\nthem, when the brush came up their bodies were<br />\nstruggling, squirming against the thick paint,<br />\ntransformed to the same color as their alarm: red.<br />\nThe large one had three of its legs torn from its<br />\nbody, but it moved even with more determination<br />\nthan the other one who had been swallowed by a<br />\nlarge red drop. The spider was in the middle like a<br />\nburnt log in a kindling fire; he seemed to accept his<br />\nfate and relax as the red oozed over the remaining<br />\nblackness of his frail body and disappear leaving a<br />\ndistinct outline like a fossil. For me, the smell was<br />\nstrong enough to kill, piercing and crashing against<br />\nmy nostrils like a drug it would penetrate to the<br />\nbone, pinning me against the flat land of time, but<br />\naway and suspended from everything that moved<br />\nin that spiraling direction, away from that<br />\nbeginning, and my cousin hadn't even noticed the<br />\nstruggle; he was over to the other edge, stroking in<br />\nrhythm with his breathing, his dark hair in his eyes,<br />\nhis expression-calm, and his ragged pants marked<br />\nwith red stains. All this time the one without the<br />\nthree legs had crawled away from them and was zig<br />\nzaging down the board leaving a faint line like a<br />\nriver on a map, it was then when I looked up and<br />\nnoticed she wasn't at the corner anymore, and my<br />\nbrush was getting dry.<br />\nE.
