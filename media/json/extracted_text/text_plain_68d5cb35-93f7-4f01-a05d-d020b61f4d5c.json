Hopkin's relatively new policy of<br />\nrecruiting more Negro students was also criticized as<br />\nbeing a token effort.<br />\nActivists critical of the University included: Walter<br />\nBrooks, Baltimore director of the Congress for Racial<br />\nEquality; Bill Henry, director of the Baltimore Tutorial Projects; Maryland Senator Julian Lapides; and<br />\nReverend Robert Meissner, a long-time participant in<br />\ncommunity-action projects.<br />\nHopkins Image\"Poor\"<br />\nSenator Lapides felt that in the area of civil rights,<br />\nHopkins' image was \"quite poor.\" He added that<br />\n\"Hopkins must take the initiative in this field.\"<br />\nWalter Brooks charged that \"it is inexcusable for any<br />\ninstitution of Hopkins' size not to address itself to<br />\nthe most crucial problems of the times.\" He stressed<br />\nthe role of Hopkins should be a \"creator and pusher.\"<br />\nHopkins was severely attacked for its lack of partiSipation in the community. Senator Lapides described<br />\nHopkins as being \"aloof from the city and neighborhood problems,\" and that the University has erected<br />\nan \"artificial wall\" between itself and the community.<br />\n<br />\nReverend Meissner stated that Hopkins must \"come<br />\nthose<br />\nto grips,\" with city problems and should help<br />\nthe<br />\n\"struggling out in the community.\" He added that<br />\nconUniversity is only a \"parasite\" if it doesn't make<br />\ntributions to help overcome Baltimore's problems.<br />\nCould Help Educational Mess<br />\nHopkins could be a crucial factor in<br />\nbelieved<br />\nMost<br />\ns<br />\nhelping clear up what was described as Baltimore'<br />\nmost<br />\n\"educational mess.\" Bill Henry observed that<br />\npower\"<br />\ncities depend on their local source of \"brain<br />\nsuch<br />\ntaken<br />\nnot<br />\nhas<br />\nHopkins<br />\nbut<br />\nto lead in education,<br />\nof \"fana role.

He added<br />\nthat Hopkins, as an established and prestigious institution, could easily get federal grants to boost educational projects throughout the city, especially for the<br />\neconomically deprived with whom the Baltimore Tutorial Project is concerned. Not only would Hopkins aid<br />\nmany understaffed and underfinanced agencies, but<br />\nthat it would \"legitimize its stand as a leading educational institution.\"<br />\n<br />\nHenry's main complaint, however, was with Hopkins students. He charged that they are \"more than<br />\napathetic.\" Out of the 200 students who helped the<br />\ntutorial project this past year, he said, only ten have<br />\ncome from Hopkins, the largest college in the \u2022 city.<br />\nBoth Reverend Meissner and Henry expressed the feeling that the Hopkins student, who has the opportunity<br />\nto acquire the best intellectual benefits, should share<br />\nthese benefits with those who are more deprived.<br />\nA main topic in the attack on Hopkins concerned<br />\nhousing. Brooks stressed the need for institutions like<br />\nHopkins to throw support behind progressive housing<br />\npolicies, inferring that initiative now will prevent<br />\nsocial problems later. He warned that if the Federal<br />\ngovernment doesn't provide massive aid, and if institutions like Hopkins don't begin a push for improvement, then the deprived Negroes would have no choice<br />\nbut to \"burn, baby, burn.\"<br />\nUniversity \"Scared\"<br />\nOn issues such as housing, Henry said that prestigious people at Hopkins \"should be man enough to<br />\nstand up and talk\" about crucial problems. Most of<br />\nHopkins critics strongly implied that the University<br />\nhas been scared to take stands on issues surrounded<br />\nby controversy. Senator Lapides underscored this feeling by saying that it should be natural for Hopkins<br />\nto be an initiator in controversial and critical areas.<br />\n(Continued on Page 3)<br />\n<br />\nNritis Ertirr ***<br />\nVOL.

Senator Lapides described<br />\nHopkins as being \"aloof from the city and neighborhood problems,\" and that the University has erected<br />\nan \"artificial wall\" between itself and the community.<br /><br />\nReverend Meissner stated that Hopkins must \"come<br />\nthose<br />\nto grips,\" with city problems and should help<br />\nthe<br />\n\"struggling out in the community.\" He added that<br />\nconUniversity is only a \"parasite\" if it doesn't make<br />\ntributions to help overcome Baltimore's problems.<br />\nCould Help Educational Mess<br />\nHopkins could be a crucial factor in<br />\nbelieved<br />\nMost<br />\ns<br />\nhelping clear up what was described as Baltimore'<br />\nmost<br />\n\"educational mess.\" Bill Henry observed that<br />\npower\"<br />\ncities depend on their local source of \"brain<br />\nsuch<br />\ntaken<br />\nnot<br />\nhas<br />\nHopkins<br />\nbut<br />\nto lead in education,<br />\nof \"fana role.

He added<br />\nthat Hopkins, as an established and prestigious institution, could easily get federal grants to boost educational projects throughout the city, especially for the<br />\neconomically deprived with whom the Baltimore Tutorial Project is concerned. Not only would Hopkins aid<br />\nmany understaffed and underfinanced agencies, but<br />\nthat it would \"legitimize its stand as a leading educational institution.\"<br /><br />\nHenry's main complaint, however, was with Hopkins students. He charged that they are \"more than<br />\napathetic.\" Out of the 200 students who helped the<br />\ntutorial project this past year, he said, only ten have<br />\ncome from Hopkins, the largest college in the \u2022 city.<br />\nBoth Reverend Meissner and Henry expressed the feeling that the Hopkins student, who has the opportunity<br />\nto acquire the best intellectual benefits, should share<br />\nthese benefits with those who are more deprived.<br />\nA main topic in the attack on Hopkins concerned<br />\nhousing. Brooks stressed the need for institutions like<br />\nHopkins to throw support behind progressive housing<br />\npolicies, inferring that initiative now will prevent<br />\nsocial problems later. He warned that if the Federal<br />\ngovernment doesn't provide massive aid, and if institutions like Hopkins don't begin a push for improvement, then the deprived Negroes would have no choice<br />\nbut to \"burn, baby, burn.\"<br />\nUniversity \"Scared\"<br />\nOn issues such as housing, Henry said that prestigious people at Hopkins \"should be man enough to<br />\nstand up and talk\" about crucial problems. Most of<br />\nHopkins critics strongly implied that the University<br />\nhas been scared to take stands on issues surrounded<br />\nby controversy. Senator Lapides underscored this feeling by saying that it should be natural for Hopkins<br />\nto be an initiator in controversial and critical areas.<br />\n(Continued on Page 3)<br /><br />\nNritis Ertirr ***<br />\nVOL.
