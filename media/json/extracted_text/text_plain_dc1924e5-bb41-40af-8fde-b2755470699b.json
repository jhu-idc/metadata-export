LXXIII NO. 14<br />\n<br />\nCalendar Reform Could Begin by Next Year<br />\nBy RICK DILLMAN<br />\n<br />\nAfter nearly twenty years of discussion<br />\nabout needed reform it now appears that<br />\nHopkins is on the verge of producing a real<br />\nchange in its academic calendar.<br />\nIn the fall of 1968 an Ad Hoc Committee<br />\nwas established by President Gordon to study<br />\nPossible methods of co-ordinating the programs<br />\nof the School of Hygiene and Public Health, the<br />\nMedical School, and Homewood Campus.<br />\nCurrently the Medical and Health Institutions<br />\noperate on a quarterly schedule while<br />\nHomewood uses a semester system. This<br />\nsituation makes the scheduling of inter-school<br />\nclasses difficult if not impossible. The purpose<br />\nof the Committee was to examine the situation<br />\nand recommend a solution which would, in the<br />\nwords of Chaiiman Dr. William Bevin, \"achieve<br />\nunity among the different branches of the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nAlthough the Committee will not vote on<br />\nthes final draft of the proposal until next<br />\nTuesday, the general outlines and goals are now<br />\nit '<br />\n<br />\nI AP.<br />\n<br />\nMedical and Health Institutions with the two<br />\n\"four\" sections. It should also be noted that the<br />\nplan may contain the beginnings of a solution to<br />\nanother long discussed problem\u2014that of closer<br />\nco-operation between Hopkins and Goucher.<br />\nThe organization of Goucher's trimester system<br />\nsystem is such that it would not take much<br />\nadjusting to transform it into a four-one-four<br />\ntype of schedule. Tentative negotiations<br />\nbetween the two administrations have been in<br />\nprogress for several months, and it is sure that<br />\nGoucher is watching the present proceedings<br />\nwith ipterest.<br />\nIf the Ad Hoc Committee reports the plan<br />\nout favorably at its Tuesday meeting, it will be<br />\nup to President Gordon to make the next move.<br />\nUpon his approval copies of the report will be<br />\nsubmitted to Homewood's Academic Council<br />\nand similar bodies of every branch of the<br />\nUniversity. If approval of these groups is secured<br />\nquickly, there is a strong possibility that the<br />\nplan would go into effect as early as next year.<br />\n(Continued to Page 13)<br />\n<br />\nWorkers Demand Grievance Committee<br />\n<br />\nih<br />\n#<br />\n<br />\nknown. The basic conclusion will be that the<br />\nUniversity's best interests would be served by<br />\nthe adoption of a four-on-four type plan.<br />\nIn brief, the plan postulates two<br />\napproximately four month long periods to be<br />\nseparated by a single one month period. The<br />\nfirst \"four\" would begin in early September and<br />\nterminate with the start of Christmas Vacation.<br />\nThis part of the plan would eliminate the much<br />\ncriticized two week \"dead\" period between New<br />\nYear's and the start of finals<br />\nJanuary would be the \"one\" section and<br />\nwould serve as a sort of mini-semester to be used<br />\nfor seminars and informal or independent study.<br />\nAlthough no solid proposal has been made,it<br />\nmay be recommended that the mini-semester be<br />\nmade mandatory for freshmen and sophomores<br />\nwith juniors and seniors having the option of<br />\ntaking the month off. A second \"four\" would<br />\nfollow beginning in early February and ending in<br />\nmid-May.<br />\nIf put into effect in this form the plan<br />\nwould match the first and third quarter of the<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nirktigiirr<br />\n<br />\nWILLIAM WALKER, Hopkins Employee,<br />\nwho sought to.\"get the workers together.\"<br />\n<br />\nBy EMIL PAVLOVICS<br />\nDespite an increase in minimum<br />\nsalaries and nearly all other salaries<br />\namong university hourly employees, the<br />\ncustodial workers intent to press their<br />\nplans for a grievance committee,<br />\nmaintained William Walker, an organizer<br />\nof the project.<br />\nA petition for the formation of a<br />\ngrievance committee for the custodial<br />\nworkers is to be presented to the<br />\nWhitehead Hall managers today. The<br />\ngeneral feeling, as expressed by<br />\nWeinbach, is that \"We would welcome<br />\nsuch a move, and think it's a very good<br />\nidea, though we aren't certain that such<br />\na need exists.\" The custodians feel that<br />\nthe committee is a \"must,\" as a<br />\nlegitimate channel for change and<br />\ncorrection.<br />\nWesley A. Taylor, Plant Manager,<br />\nand Joseph Rumberger, Director of<br />\nPersonnel Services, jointly announced<br />\nthat, as of February 3, all minimum<br />\nsalaties were raised from $1.46 perhour<br />\nto $1.60 per hour. \"Wage reviews are a<br />\ncontinuing process,' Taylor and<br />\nRumberger said, \"and it is anticipated<br />\nthat further raises, on an individual<br />\nbasis, will be made.\"<br />\nGeorge Weinbach, Assistant to the<br />\nPlant Manager, felt that the \"raise had<br />\nbeen in the works for quite a while, and<br />\nwas merely the result of continual<br />\nreviews of the situation.\"<br />\nNot Just Wages<br />\n<br />\nROBERT PINKERTON\u2014\"The best of that<br />\nWhitehead Hall Crew\"<br />\n<br />\nWalker, however, felt that the<br />\nraise was an attempt to stifle the<br />\ngrowing unrest among the univeristy<br />\n<br />\nworkers over low wages and unresolved<br />\ngrievances. The attempt would be futile,<br />\nhe added, since \"our grievances are not<br />\nsolely in the area of wages; and even the<br />\niwage issue has not been resolved to our<br />\ntotal satisfaction.\"<br />\nTo achieve a living wage for the,<br />\nworkers, he maintains that a $.15 an<br />\nshour increase would be in order for all<br />\nworkers, and not just starting workers.<br />\nThe increases for workers already<br />\non the payroll was miniscule in<br />\ncomparison to the increase for those<br />\njust hired.<br />\nInitially, Walker experienced great<br />\ndifficulty in obtaining the signatures of<br />\nthe older employees on the grievance<br />\n<br />\ncommittee petition, since most felt that<br />\nthey would lose their jobs if they signed<br />\nsuch a petition.<br />\nThey based this belief on<br />\nincidents in previous years when<br />\npressure was supposed to have been<br />\nexerted on the workers, when they had<br />\nattempted to organize. This pressure<br />\nseemed to have been exerted from<br />\nWhitehead, and again took the form of<br />\nthreatened loss of jobs.<br />\nIt was only when the older<br />\nemployees saw that Walker was not<br />\nbeing fired for his part in organizing<br />\nthem that they felt safe enough to sign<br />\nthe petition.<br />\n(Continued to Page 14)<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nMIT \"Research Stoppage\"<br />\nStrike Spreads to Hopkin!<br />\nA plan for a one-day \"research<br />\nstoppage\" on March 4 to protest<br />\ngovernment \"misuse of science\" has<br />\nspread to Hopkins.<br />\nThis movement was begun at<br />\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology<br />\nand has also taken hold at Yale and<br />\nCornell. A principal issue in the \"strike\"<br />\nis opposition to the Government's<br />\nplanned anti-ballistic missiles system<br />\n(ABM). Organizers of the strike claim<br />\nthat the ABM is technically indefensible<br />\nand is diverting badly-needed funds<br />\nfrom social welfare programs.<br />\nOne of the organizers at Hopkins,<br />\nMichael Ornstein, proposed a similar<br />\naction at Hopkins after he had been in<br />\ntouch with two MIT graduate students<br />\nwho are working on the MIT Science<br />\nAction Coordinating Committee,<br />\n(SACC).<br />\n<br />\nA six member committee, th<br />\nMarch 4 Strike Committee, has bee<br />\nformed here.

A<br />\nnew one was needed, according to<br />\nCouncil president Russ Passarella,<br />\nbecause the \"old constitution obviously<br />\nwasn't being followed\" and \"something<br />\nwas drastically wrong.\"<br />\nEmbodied in the new constitution<br />\nis a limitation on how much the<br />\nyearbook may spend. All expenditures<br />\nover $50 have to be approved by the<br />\nbook's Board of Control and the<br />\npresident of the SAC. This was done<br />\nbecause the last two yearbooks, for the<br />\nonly time in the history of the<br />\nHullabaloo, lost money. Senior class<br />\nfunds must make up any deficit<br />\nincurred.<br />\nRegular Meetings<br />\nThe document was accepted as<br />\nproposed, except for one change in the<br />\nrules governing the Board of Control<br />\nsessions. The Hullabaloo's officers must<br />\nmeet weekly during the second semester<br />\nand bi-weekly during the first.<br />\nSix of the seven-man Board of<br />\nControl were accepted by the Student<br />\nCouncil without debate. They are:<br />\nCrawford, editor-in-chief; Ken Locker,<br />\nphotography editor; Roger Moose,<br />\ncampus editor; Allan Rubeo, business<br />\nmanager; John Globig, SAC<br />\nrepresentative; and Dave Wirtz, senior<br />\nclass representative.<br />\nThe appointment of John Adams<br />\nas executive editor was protested bY<br />\nCrawford, who suggested Joel Ziskin in<br />\nhis stead. Ziskin is a junior who has<br />\nworked for the Hullabaloo, literary<br />\nmagazine, Baltimore Free Press, and the<br />\nNews-Letter. His nomination was voted<br />\ndown 5-3 with five abstentions, and<br />\nAdams was accepted. A sophomore<br />\ntransfer student from Virginia Military<br />\nInstitute, Adams has worked on<br />\nyearbooks at his high school and<br />\nprevious college. Passarella stated that<br />\n\"knowledge of how a yearbook is done<br />\nis what is important,\" not length of<br />\nattendance at Hopkins. Adams has been<br />\nhere since September.<br />\n\"Unconstitutional\"<br />\nWording in parts of the<br />\nconstitution is unclear, in the opinion of<br />\nCrawford. The executive editor has been<br />\ngiven total control over the yearbook's<br />\nlayout, but it is not specified as to<br />\nwhether the Board of Control or the<br />\neditor-in-chief can override his<br />\ndecisions.<br />\nBelieving that the Student<br />\nCouncil's action was \"unconstitutional<br />\nfrom every aspect,\" Crawford declared<br />\nthat the Council was not empowered to<br />\nestablish a constitution for an<br />\nextracurricular activity. He interprets it<br />\nas a \"purely political move.\"<br />\nIn defense of the Council,<br />\npresident Passarella stated that its<br />\nconstitution gives it the responsibilitY<br />\nfor all organizations on campus, a<br />\ndelegation of power that he contrues to<br />\ninclude supervision over the by-laws of<br />\nthose organizations. There are no<br />\nprecedents.<br />\nStating that his power as<br />\neditor-in-chief is \"non-existent,''<br />\nCrawford asserted that \"I really have<br />\nvery little influence with the Board of<br />\nControl\". In his opinion the future of<br />\nthe Hullabaloo is very dim. \"The 1969<br />\nyearbook isn't even going to be worth<br />\nreading,\" he said. According to him, it<br />\nwill be \"a return to the pre-high school<br />\nsyndrome ...a book without anY,<br />\nredeeming artistic content whatsoever:<br />\nIt will be extremely dull as far as layout<br />\ngoes.\"<br />\n.; \u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,FEB. 14, 1969<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 3<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nS.A.

Of the three presently \"active\" programs, one,<br />\nthe S.A. tutorial project, has 175 students; while the<br />\nAPO project has five students, and Victor Dates'<br />\nprogram for disadvantaged children now has ten.<br />\nFrancis Smith, president of APO, argues that he<br />\napproaches tutorial projects in a different manner than<br />\nthe S.A., and, besides, the S.A. has \"given us the cold<br />\nshoulder.\" Nevertheless, it does appear from last<br />\nsemester's activity that there are substantial difficulties<br />\nin developing the type of program Smith envisioned.<br />\nBasically APO has tried to cultivate a \"one-to-one<br />\nrelationship\" between the tutor and the tutee. In<br />\naddition to such a relationship, Smith tried to adopt a<br />\n\"block\" tactic attracting ghetto dwellers from the same<br />\n<br />\nJOE WEINBERG, president of the Student Association,<br />\ndiscusses the SA's Urban programs.<br />\n<br />\narea. In this way he hoped to further reduce the<br />\ninhibitions to tutoring activities which have occurred in<br />\nother projects.<br />\nLick of Time<br />\nUnfortunately Smith stated that there was some<br />\ndifficulty maintaining both the interests of the tutors<br />\nand any continuing relationship with the tutees. Few<br />\nstudents had the necessary time to devote to such a<br />\nprogram.<br />\n\"Because of these difficulties we have to make the<br />\nprogram more relevant and workable,\"stated Smith.<br />\nAPO is not the only campus organization to call<br />\nfor a \"more relevant and workable\" program, however.<br />\nMichael Amey, president of the Urban Affairs Council,<br />\nlamely stated that the UAC has been in a \"transitionary<br />\nstage\" during the last semester, attempting to reorganize<br />\ntheir program. Plans for such \"reorganization\" are as yet<br />\nuncertain.<br />\nThe difficulties facing APO and the Urban Affairs<br />\nCouncil are characteristic of some but not tall of the<br />\ncampus programs. Jim Arcibald's AWARE and Jim<br />\nCleary's tutoring program stand out as being notably<br />\nmore successful. Archibald is presently planning a large<br />\nscale recruitment drive for second semester because his<br />\npresent staff is not able to handle the increased activities<br />\nof AWARE.<br />\nThe differences between AWARE, with seven<br />\nspeaking engagements for February already confirmed,<br />\nand APO and the Urban Affairs Council which are<br />\n\"seeking more relevant and workable directions\" is<br />\nstriking. Although all groups began the semester with<br />\nsubstantial ideas and the hopes of expanding those ideas<br />\ninto workable programs, not all were successful. The<br />\nStudents' Opportunities in the Inner City, for example,<br />\nhas been cancelled by its chairman, Martin Hickey.<br />\nHickey indicated that the program was unable to draw<br />\nstudent interest or find the necessary information.<br />\nThe Myth of Student Apathy<br />\nAs one of the reasons for the organizational<br />\ndifficulties both Amey and Smith, along with Mike<br />\nRosenberg of the Community Involvement Board cited<br />\nstudent apathy as a major factor in the difficulties their<br />\nprograms were facing. Smith stated, for example, that<br />\n\"it is very difficult for undergraduates to get involved,<br />\nbasically a Hoppy does what the Establishment tells him<br />\nto do.\"<br />\nThis attitude, although prevelant on Homewood<br />\ncampus, has little factual support. AWARE has close to<br />\n40 students participating in the program and Archibald<br />\nis confident that the number can be expanded; S.A.<br />\ntutoring has 175 students tutoring and Wickwire hopes<br />\n<br />\nthat even that number may be expanded. In all, nearly<br />\n10% of the undergraduate body, participates in<br />\nHomewood tutoring activities.<br />\nS.A. President Joe Weinberg stated that this makes<br />\nthe Homewood campus one of the more active campuses<br />\nin the nation. The major difficulty, therefore, is not in<br />\nmotivating thes students but in attracting them to<br />\nspecific projects.<br />\n\"It isn't so much a question of having a vague<br />\nprogram that you want to do and then asking students<br />\nto help you firgure it out,\" said Archibald,\"You have to<br />\nbe able to present the students with a plan, you have to<br />\nbe able to tell them what you want to do. If you can't<br />\ndo that you'll never get sutdents to work, they'll go to<br />\nother projects.\"<br />\nNeed For Coordination<br />\nIn light of the success of both AWARE and the<br />\nS.A. tutoring, it appears that coordinated planning for<br />\nthe individual projects is essential. It becomes impossible<br />\njust to \"want to tutor\" or \"want to help educate others\"<br />\nabout the inner city without some idea of direction.<br />\nOriginally this coordination was to be<br />\naccomplished by the Community Involvement Board.<br />\nStudents interested in working in the Inner City or in<br />\ncommunity related projects were to go to the C. I. B.<br />\nand, from there, to the specific programs which<br />\ninterested them. Unfortunately, such a OP suffered<br />\nfrom several difficulties.<br />\nOne of the major problems was that few people<br />\nknow exactly what the other organizations were trying<br />\nto accomplish. Only a few of the programs had specific<br />\nprograms outlined.<br />\nSimilarly not everyone was willing to work with<br />\nthe CIB. Francis Smith stated \"I don't really see what<br />\ngood coordination would do.\" He indicated that he felt<br />\nthe CIB was \"administratively bogged down.\"<br />\nThere is also an overlap between organizations so<br />\nthat students were never clear about the realtionships<br />\nbetween the various organizations. Martin Hickey,<br />\npresident of the Student Opportunities in the Inner City<br />\nstated that his organization to a large extent duplicated<br />\nthe work of the CIB. Hickey and Rosenberg discovered<br />\nduplication when they happened to meet at Freshman<br />\norientation.<br />\nAlthough these difficulties are facing present:<br />\nprograms at Homewood, the outlook is not totally<br />\nbleak. There are presently the beginnings of some<br />\nattempt at closes-coordination between inner city<br />\nprograms.<br />\nNevertheless, stated Hickey, \"with nothing<br />\norganized and nobody knowing what is going on, city<br />\ninvolvement is dead.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,FEB. 14, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nCommission Links Students<br />\nTo Sharp Rise of Violence<br />\nWASHINGTON (CPS)\u2014A preliminary<br />\nreport of the National Commission on the<br />\nCauses and Prevention of Violence says that<br />\nyoung people provide the \"thrust\" of much of<br />\nthe group protest and collective violence in the<br />\nghetto, in the streets, and on the campuses.<br />\n\"The key to much of the violence in our society<br />\nseems to lie with the young,\" says the report, which the<br />\ncomission calls \"only tentative, a first look, and subject<br />\nto revision.\"<br />\nThe final report and recommendations are due in<br />\nthe spring; investigation will continue till then: \"It may<br />\nbe with tomorrow's generation that much of the<br />\nemphasis of our studies and the national response should<br />\nlie.\"<br />\nFrustrated by System<br />\nThe observation about youth is one of 10 \"themes<br />\nof challenge\" for Americans listed by the report.<br />\nAnother notes that \"violent protest today...has occurred<br />\nin part because protesters believe they cannot make their<br />\ndemands felt effectively through normal, approved .<br />\nchannels and that 'the system,' for whatever reasons, has<br />\nbecome unresponsive to them.\"<br />\nThe report also mentions \"additional<br />\ncomplications\" that arise from \"the high visibility\" of<br />\nboth violence and social inequities through the mass<br />\nmedia.

Under<br />\nChairman Milton S.

A fact-finding team was recently<br />\nsent to San Francisco State College.<br />\nA few years ago the extremely small minority of<br />\nblack students tended to be individualistic and mostly<br />\npolitically inactive, the report notes. \"The Black Power<br />\nMovement, however, coupled with substantial increases<br />\nin the number of black students, has offered some (of<br />\nthem) a vehicle for giving collective expression to their<br />\nparticular grievances.\"<br />\nViolence Will Stay<br />\n\"The elimination of all violence in a free society is<br />\nimpossible,\" the commission report concluded,\"But the<br />\nbetter control of illegitimate violence in our democratic<br />\nsociety is an urgent imperative, and one within our<br />\nmeans to accomplish.<br />\nIn its \"themes and challenge,\" the report notes<br />\nthat not all violence is illegitimate. \"Indeed, a major<br />\nfunction of society is the organization and legitimization<br />\nof violence in the interest of maintaining society itself.\"<br />\nSome violence may be committed by persons with<br />\nderanged minds or abnormal biological make-up, but<br />\n<br />\nDR.

Instead, the IFC has scheduled a rush period each<br />\nnight for the past four days of this week During this<br />\ntime, each fraternity is assigned to a different freshman<br />\n,house for an hour and can concentrate all its brothers on<br />\nthat one house.<br />\nDave Norris, President of the IFC, saw two<br />\nadvantages in this system. \"First, it will give us (the<br />\nfraternities) a chance to see every freshman in the first<br />\nweek. Second, the freshmen will get a better chance to<br />\nsee the fraternities.\" In the opinion of Mickey Bleiden,<br />\nChancellor of TEP, the new rush rules will tend to make<br />\nrush too formal. \"We will only be able to meet each<br />\nfreshman once in the first week, preventing us from<br />\ngetting them to know them as well as before,\" said<br />\nPresident Eric Herzog. However, he saw the advantage of<br />\n\"more freshmen being in their rooms because there are<br />\nno class conflicts.\"<br />\nThere was general agreement that the IFC should<br />\nsoon eliminate the no contract rule which prevents<br />\ncontact between brothers and freshmen in the first<br />\nsemester. One fraternity president said of the present<br />\nsystem, \"It puts too much pressure on the freshmen<br />\nwhen they receive invitations to dirty rush parties. The<br />\nfraternities have dirty rush parties only to keep up with<br />\nthe other fraternities.\" He felt it would be better all<br />\naround if there were regular contacts between freshmen<br />\nand fraternity men in the first semester. Eric Herzog<br />\nsuggested \"encouraging normal contact without breaking<br />\nthe rules through IFC dances, all fraternity TGIFs or<br />\npanel discussions with freshmen and brothers.\"<br />\nIt was also suggested that the freshmen go to the<br />\nfraternity houses during the first week.

However, the recent<br />\nmanuevrings of the Hopkins Administration (and in this group we include<br />\nStudent Council President Russell Passarella \u2014 the distinction between<br />\nhim, and say, Dr. Gordon, is negligible) compel us to do so, however<br />\nreluctantly.<br />\nAdministration members, and their undergraduate shadows on the<br />\nStudent Council, have always strongly disliked the News-Letter.<br />\nConsidering the content of our editorial opinion, this is to be expected.<br />\nYet, while we have always openly spelled out our positions, certain<br />\nmembers of the Administration, particularly Dr. Gordon, have<br />\nconsistently been less than open (we would say \"sneaky,\" but that is<br />\nimpolite) in their dealings with the News-Letter. Last year, for instance,<br />\nDr. Gordon requested that the editors of the News-Letter delete certain<br />\ncomments from an account of a talk given here by the then Governor,<br />\nSpiro Agnew. The N-L Board of Control was summoned to Dr. Gordon's<br />\nhome the .night before the issue was to appear and he reiterated his<br />\nC'request.\" When the editors refused to comply, Dr. Gordon paused,<br />\ntamped his pipe, and said that he \"would have to look into changing the<br />\nmethods by which the News-Letter staff was elected.\" The experience was<br />\nenlightening \u2014 we gained firsthand insight into the workings of a mind<br />\nwhich was a product of the United States State Department, an<br />\norganization not always reputable for its \"above-the-board\" dealings.<br />\nThe latest Administration-Student Council venture in this realm has<br />\nbeen its immediate support of the new publication, The Odyssey, due to<br />\nappear in the near future. Our intent in discussing the \"birth\" of the<br />\nOdyssey will, no doubt, be miscontrued. We feel that a second campus<br />\nnewspaper might help to provide the needed enema to enliven the<br />\nHomewood Campus. Moreover, it is apparent to us that the editors of the<br />\nOdyssey sincerely want to establish a paper to fill a void which they feel<br />\nexists on campus and not to serve as a latter day Johns Hopkins Journal.<br />\nWhat concerns us is the total lack of candor on the part of the<br />\nAdministration and Student Council as to their part in this venture.<br />\nSince 1967, two groups have approached the University seeking<br />\nfunds to put out a publication. In 1966-67, a group of freshmen wished to<br />\nstart a publication which would fill the gap left by the then-defunct<br />\nCharles Street Review. During this past semester, another group of<br />\nstudents tried to begin a social sciences version of the Vector. Both groups<br />\nwere offered little encouragement, (much less funds). In this context, it<br />\nseems more than strange that a group of undergraduates, who, whether<br />\nthey intended to or not, gave the impression that their publication would<br />\nbe \"pro-Ad ministration\" and \"pro-Student Council\" received an<br />\nimmediate promise of full funding for their first issue, a free darkroom,<br />\nand offices. In the past, the University and the Student Council have not<br />\nbeen known to be as generous with their money.<br />\n<br />\nWU YOU SE<br />\nVA/XOTIOC<br />\n<br />\nMD IF<br />\nI RE\u2014<br />\n<br />\nWitt (fOU 66<br />\n<br />\nMO IF I<br />\n1FU5E<br />\n<br />\nMY VAI,EISI(kC<br />\n<br />\nFUSE<br />\n<br />\nMO!<br />\n<br />\nIf ITS 11-1E(AST 71-1106<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nO 11,1, ifc'EAK YOU<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\nBy Permission Atlas Magazine<br />\n<br />\nThe whole financial picture surrounding the Odyssey confirms our<br />\nsuspicions. The Odyssey, in presenting their case to the Student Council.<br />\npledged to fund future issues completely by advertising revenue.<br />\nObviously, the Student Council and the University, in their eagerness to<br />\nsee an \"anti-News-Letter\" publication, did not even bother to thoroughly<br />\ninvestigate the Odyssey's financial future\u2014fact is, as one of the editors of<br />\nthe Odyssey confidentially admitted, that the Odyssey probably cannot<br />\nattract enough advertising revenue to subsidize even a fraction of their<br />\npublication costs.<br />\nThis fact has an interesting sidelight. At a lunch meeting between<br />\nmembers of the Administration and \"student leaders,\" Dr. Gordon told<br />\none of the News-Letter editors that he assumed that the N-L would now<br />\nhave to \"split its advertising\" with the Odyssey, (i.e., that the News-Letter<br />\nwould therefore have to curtail its own operations). When Dr. Gordon was<br />\ninformed that the N-L, holds the local franchise on national collegiate<br />\nadvertising (making national ads unavailable to the Odyssey), the good<br />\npresident exhibited a high degree of perturbation, ostensibly over the<br />\nburning issue of \"monopoly.\" It is also interesting to note that for a man<br />\nwho has had little-to-no contact with students since his inauguration Dr.<br />\nGordon has been kept assiduously posted on the Odyssey's progress.<br />\nFrom our own experience, we know that the local Baltimore<br />\nadvertising market, even should the Odyssey achieve the wildest successes,<br />\nprovides insignificant revenue. Yet, according to an editor of the Odyssey<br />\n(which is using Baltimore's most expensive printer), the paper, despite the<br />\nfinancial picutre, will definitely be going bi-weekly next year. How? The<br />\nOdyssey will ask for a sizable budget from the university(which,if they go<br />\non a bi-weekly basis will probably make their budget the largest of any<br />\nstudent organization, including the N-L) and as their editors smugly<br />\nbelieve, they will probably get what they ask for. Obviously, a far cry<br />\nfrom \"paying one's own way.\" This is related only to illustrate one point<br />\n\u2014 the manner in which Hopkins officials and student administrators<br />\noperate. One wonders why the Student Council did not investigate the<br />\nOdyssey's financial situation as throughly as they did the qualifications of<br />\nthe Black Student Union.<br />\nThus, the Administration is hopeful that its generous efforts will let<br />\nthem reap their desired reward.

For though<br />\nSHAME is a brilliant and powerful<br />\nmovie, it is a very bleak and pessimistic<br />\ncommentary on the human situation.<br />\nThe action transpires around a<br />\ncouple living alone on an unnamed<br />\nisland, caught in the rages of an<br />\nunexplained civil war. Their cottage<br />\nwalls are bare and dull, their farm is<br />\nrundown, and the ambient landscapes<br />\nare vest empty wastes. Eva (played by<br />\nLiv Ullman) and Jan Rosenberg (Max<br />\nvon Sydow) resides in this isolated<br />\nenvironment, raising and selling<br />\nlingonberries, and reminiscing over their<br />\ndays as musicians with the Philharmonic<br />\nOrchestra.<br />\nTwo major themes become<br />\napparent by the end of the movie, but<br />\nimmediately manifest is an anti-war<br />\nbias. We are presented with two armies<br />\nclashing and destroying for no given<br />\nreason at all. Bergman does not wish to<br />\ncomplicate his film with ideologies, for<br />\nthey can be disputed and debated.<br />\nPerhaps pacifism is indisputable for him.<br />\nThe soldiers themselves are<br />\nanonymous robots, whose faces are<br />\neither covered up or avoided by the<br />\ncamera. Brief but sharp vignettes of<br />\nGestapo-like brutality are recorded, and<br />\nthey sink slowly into one's memory<br />\nrather than drench it with the gory<br />\nsensationalism that other anti-war films<br />\nseem to specialize in.<br />\nThe other and more complex<br />\ntheme of SHAME is the question of<br />\ninvolvement in life and to what extent<br />\nshould the individual commit himself to<br />\nparticipation in his society. Hollis<br />\nAlpert, in a recent issue of Saturday<br />\nReview, declared that Bergman was<br />\nexpressing the collective guilt felt by<br />\nSwedes for remaining neutral during the<br />\ntwo World Wars. According to Alpert,<br />\nBerg,man's point is that non-involvement<br />\nis not possible. However, the ending is<br />\nsuch a brutal apocalyptic vision of the<br />\nfutility and frustration of life, that one<br />\nwonders why involvement per se should<br />\n<br />\neven be attempted.<br />\nPresents<br />\nCaptured by one side in the war,<br />\nthe Rosenbergs are thrust before a local<br />\ncommandant (played by Gunnar<br />\nBjornstrand), a friend who develops an<br />\nattachment for them. He visits their<br />\nfarm and brings them presents. In other<br />\nwords, they DO become involved.<br />\nBergman depicts the nightmare results<br />\nof this association through the use of<br />\nsymbols, the most explicit of which are<br />\nthe radio, the character of Jan<br />\nRosenberg, and the ending of the film.<br />\nThe simple radio, besides<br />\nrepresenting the technological<br />\nachievements of society, is a device<br />\nwhich conveys information of events<br />\nand personalities almost as quickly as<br />\nthey become news. For the first half of<br />\nSHAME the Rosenberg's radio isn't<br />\nworking; they are out of touch with the<br />\nworld, they do not even know what is<br />\nhappening. After their release from<br />\nprison, their interrogator (Bjornstrand)<br />\ngives them a radio; they are no longer<br />\naloof, and cannot plead ignorance. This<br />\ninvolvement, specifically with the<br />\ncommandant, brings about the<br />\nprostitution of Eva and the destruction<br />\nby fire of their small homestead.<br />\nThis analysis of Bergman's<br />\n<br />\nintentions is reinforced by inspection of<br />\nthe evolution in the character of Jan<br />\nRosenberg. We first see him as a<br />\nveritable apostate from life, lost from<br />\nthe track of society without any desire<br />\nto find it. He is sexually impotent,<br />\ncannot even shoot a hen at close range<br />\nto provide food, and will not run to the<br />\naid of a stranded paratrooper.<br />\nBut during his experience in<br />\ncaptivity, and shortly thereafter, he<br />\nchanges. He executes the commandant,<br />\nwho had taken advantage of Eva, his<br />\nwife. Soon the meek musician murders a<br />\nyoung deserter, just for the boy's boots.<br />\nJan has become involved.<br />\nFutility<br />\nReaching a nadir (or is it zenith?)<br />\nof cinematic pessimismin the effective<br />\nending, Bergman sums up SHAME with<br />\na harst exposition of the futility of life.<br />\nThe Rosenbergs attempt to escape in a<br />\nlarge rowboat from their island to the<br />\nmainland\u2014from bucolic isolation to the<br />\nmainstream of human existence. They<br />\nfail, and are left drifting aimlessly in the<br />\nfreezing sea, their fate unresolved but<br />\neasily imagined.<br />\nIt is possible that Bergman is uring<br />\nhis fellow man to shun the peace of<br />\nisolation and plunge into life, or at least<br />\n<br />\nWho Runs the Colleges?<br />\nBy JOHN HALPERIN<br />\nThe disturbances at the<br />\nUniversities of Chicago and California<br />\npoint to a thorny problem in higher<br />\neducation, a problem that is becoming<br />\nincreasingly ubiquitous every year. I<br />\nmean, of course, the problem of the<br />\nrelationship between the student and<br />\nthe university of which he is a part.<br />\nHow much power should student'<br />\nhave; There are cogent arguments on<br />\nboth sides. The \"conservative\" position<br />\nis that students, being both transient<br />\nand inconsistent, should have little to<br />\nsay about permanent aspects of<br />\nuniversity policy. They automatically<br />\n<br />\nsubmit themselves to university rules<br />\nand regulations when they matriculate,<br />\nand they may either abide by the<br />\nuniversity's requirements or leave. No<br />\none will force them to stay. The<br />\n\"radical\" argument is that a university is<br />\nits students\u2014no more, no less\u2014and that<br />\nthe university is thus bound to consider<br />\nstudent opinions seriously. The<br />\nuniversities, says the radical, have not<br />\nfulfilled their functions as institutions<br />\nof higher learning because they have not<br />\nresponded meaningfully to the needs<br />\nand desires of this generation of<br />\nstudents.<br />\nOf course all of this represents a<br />\ngross simplication of many complicated<br />\n<br />\nLocal Drama Two Poles<br />\nBy ROBIN HOLT<br />\nThe past three weeks have been<br />\nones of extemes in local theatre<br />\nconcerned with the Hopkins campus.<br />\nOn January 31, Hopkins offered its<br />\nsecond play of the season and last<br />\nThursday, Goucher assaulted the public,<br />\nwith an original dramatization of<br />\nNathanial Hawthorne's The Scarlet<br />\nLetter. But one at a time.<br />\nThe very title of Athol - Fugard's<br />\ntwo character play, The Blood Knot,<br />\ncarries with it an overwhelming visceral<br />\nodor. It represents, I think, a marked<br />\ndeparture from the tragi-comic style we<br />\nhave seen for some time now at Theatre<br />\nHopkins. The Blood Knot is a play<br />\nabout racism or, to take the more<br />\npositive angle without sounding trite,<br />\nbrotherhood. Two men, one white, one<br />\nblack, live together (sorry, all you Boys<br />\nin the Band enthusiasts, no<br />\nhomosexuality in this one) in a one<br />\nroom shack in the non-white section of<br />\nPort Elizabeth, South Africa.<br />\nEach is the other's brother in the<br />\naccustomed metaphorical sense; but in<br />\nthe course of the play we are forced to<br />\nask the prickly biological and<br />\nphilosophical question: what makes<br />\nmen brothers? The approach of Fugard<br />\nto this question is intensely sensual.<br />\nWhen Morris (Donald Hart) the white<br />\nman, puts on Zachariah's (Irving<br />\nTurner) coat he talks about getting<br />\ninside the flesh of a man when you can<br />\n<br />\nshowing that such isolation cannot last<br />\nfor long. Yet he also grimly portrays<br />\nwhat must inevitably come from<br />\ninvolvement. Each individual must<br />\ndecide. Is it really better to have tried<br />\nand lost than not to have tried at all?<br />\nIn a last digression, we must<br />\nquestion the rating given this film by<br />\nthe Motion Picture Association of<br />\nAmerica. SHAME received an R, which<br />\nmeans that children under the age of 16<br />\n(1 7 in some places) must be<br />\naccompanied by a parent or guardian.<br />\nThere is no apparent reason for this.<br />\nThe fleeting nudity at the very<br />\nbeginning does not last long enough for<br />\neven thes most experienced voyeur's<br />\neyelids to contract. Sex plays an<br />\nastonishingly minimal role, and nowhere<br />\neven vaguely approaches explicitness.<br />\nThere is more violence in one Road<br />\nRunner cartoon, televised to<br />\nimpressionable pre-adolescents on<br />\nSaturday morning, than in their<br />\nfeature-length movie. So why the R<br />\nrating?<br />\nPerhaps John Wayne and his<br />\nGreen Beret militarists control the<br />\nrating structure, and are afraid that the<br />\nanti-war attitude of this film will<br />\n\"corrupt\" the kill-a-Commie-for-Christ<br />\ndesires of potential cannon fodder.<br />\nSounds ridiculous, doesn't it?<br />\nYou think of a better reason.<br />\n<br />\nwrap yourself in the small of him.<br />\nPleasure and Pain<br />\nThe stock ingredients of<br />\nsensuality are pleasure and pain, and<br />\nFugard seems to deliver more of the<br />\nlatter. Knowledge is pain: the<br />\nknowledge that Zach gains discovering<br />\nhis pen pal is white. How can he meet<br />\nher? How can he accept this barrier? He<br />\naccepts it by giving her to Morris. This is<br />\nthe games of trading they play as<br />\nbrothers, but later their game becomes<br />\ncruel.<br />\nThey begin to play at being<br />\nhonkey and nigger and they believe<br />\ntheir roles and suddenly Morris, dressed<br />\nin Zach's fine \"white\" clothes lunges at<br />\nhis brother and begins to beat him.<br />\nAfter an hour of brotherly sentiments<br />\nthat make us feel good for humanity, all<br />\nof the latent race hatred surges up in all<br />\nits bitterness before us.<br />\nThe Blood Knot is an incredibly<br />\ngusty play. The performances of Donald<br />\nHart and Irving Turner leave the<br />\nhalf-spectator, half-participant\u2014the line<br />\nin this play is very thin\u2014utterly drained.<br />\nAnd it is a considerable accolade to the<br />\nactors and Ed Golden that one has to<br />\nrest his senses before his mind can<br />\nabsorb the thought of the\\play.<br />\nAt the other end of the theatrical<br />\nspectrum was The Scarlet Letter. There<br />\nare some books which should not be<br />\ndramatized\u2014ever. It would be a kindness<br />\nto end my review here but duty to my<br />\n<br />\nfellow sufferers in the audience impels<br />\nme forward. This new dramatization<br />\nwas the work of Marion Robinson, head<br />\nof the English and Drama Departments<br />\nat Goucher and it was directed by<br />\nGeorge Dowell. Any play written in<br />\neight difference scenes creates problems<br />\non continuity, but the author of this<br />\nexceptionally chewy caramel was not<br />\ncontent with that. Nevertheless, she<br />\nfailed to realize that one simply cannot<br />\nsay \"Prithee, what go here,\" to an<br />\nAmerican audience in the latter third of<br />\nthe twentieth century and get away<br />\nwith it. I mean, what is the audience<br />\ngoing to think of the past participle of<br />\n\"I trow\"\u2014I truaght?<br />\nBlah<br />\nAlthough it had all the subtlety of<br />\na falling spotlight and about the same<br />\ndegree of inspired symbolism, the scene<br />\nof Arthur. Dimesdale against the pillory<br />\nin a Christ pose did wake the audience<br />\nup and made them hope that, for a<br />\nfleeting second, this atrocity might get<br />\noff the ground (this was in the fifth<br />\nscene after the Prologue).<br />\nA final note: A Hopkins wag<br />\nwrote in the men's room at<br />\nintermission, \"Hester Prynne needs a<br />\ndiaphragm\" which sums up the<br />\nseriousness with which this play ought<br />\nto be treated. Revelation: The real sin<br />\nof The Scarlet Letter was not Hester's<br />\nadultery, but Goucher's The Scarlet<br />\nLetter.<br />\n<br />\nfactors, but I think these are the major<br />\nissues involved. Who should run a<br />\nuniversity\u2014the faculty or the students?<br />\nIf the faculty, how much influence<br />\nshould students have upon its decisions?<br />\nIf the students, why have faculties at<br />\nall?<br />\nMy own opinion is that both sides<br />\nare both right and wrong, but that the<br />\nradical students\u2014at least the ones at<br />\nChicago and California\u2014are more in the<br />\nwrong than the university<br />\nadministrations themselves. It is true<br />\nthat at some universities changes are<br />\nneeded badly, but these should<br />\ninevitably come about with continued<br />\npressure from students. Yet student<br />\ndemands are often ridiculous. The<br />\nstudents at Chicago, for example, want<br />\namong other things a fifty-percent say<br />\nin the hiring and firing of faculty<br />\nmembers. Why did they come to the<br />\nUniversity at all if they considered<br />\nthemselves qualified as much as the men<br />\nteaching them to judge the quality of<br />\nresearch, publication, and teaching of<br />\nfaculty members? Instead of going to<br />\ncollege they should have gone to<br />\nheaven. If it is true, as they say, that<br />\nthey cannot be taught by men who<br />\nwent to school in the Thirties, then why<br />\nenter the University at all? Why not<br />\nsimply teach each other? These radical<br />\nstudents are of course a small minority,<br />\nbut they represent, to me at least, the<br />\nsort of exorbitant nihilism that could<br />\nwell wreck our greatest universities,<br />\nbeset as they already are by a lack of<br />\nfunds due to several consecutive<br />\nnational administrations more interested<br />\nin killing children than in educating<br />\nthem.<br />\nConflict in Values<br />\nThese same students at Chicago,<br />\nseveral years ago, occupied the<br />\nadministration building after the<br />\nUniversity decided that while it would<br />\nnot disclose grades to draft boards if<br />\nstudents requested them not to, it<br />\nwould disclose them upon the request<br />\nof the student. The radicals demanded<br />\nthat the University agree not to disclose<br />\nclass standing even at the student's own<br />\nrequest, which would of course have<br />\nbeen a blatant encroachment upon the<br />\nrights of those who wanted to use their<br />\nclass standing as a protection from the<br />\ndraft. That confrontation was settled<br />\nwhen the radicals were finally convinced<br />\n(Continued to Page 9)<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER \u2014<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEB. lt4 19'6\u00a7\"<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nLawandOrdure: PilferedPaper<br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nFingertips on table: tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap<br />\nSomebody has apparently stolen my paper.<br />\nShouldn't mind, it was already graded, graded and left in<br />\nan open box in front of the History Office, box labeled<br />\n\"War in the Modern World\" containing several other<br />\npapers (many of which were also stolen) and all final<br />\nexams for the course.

For the past two years since the<br />\ntournament was made an all-school affair (combined<br />\ncompetition of fraternities, freshman houses, anc<br />\nupperclass dorms), a freshman house has walked off with<br />\nfirst place honors. Royce was this year's overall<br />\ntournament winner with 68 points. In second place with<br />\n3 out of the 9 first places to their credit was Tau Epsilon<br />\nPhi with a team score of 63. Adams was third overall in<br />\nthe tournament and second among the freshman house:<br />\nwith 39 points. Second among the fraternities was Beta.<br />\nHaving entered eight of the nine weight classes.<br />\nRoyce managed to place all but one of these into the<br />\nsemifinal rounds on Friday night. Adams and TEF<br />\nfollowed closely with 5 each in the semifinals, and then<br />\ncame ATO, Phi Psi, and Gildersleeve all with three<br />\napiece: Although there were not as many participants in<br />\nthis year's tournament as in past years, there still were<br />\nmany contested weight classes.<br />\nIn the heavyweight division, Alpha Tau Omega's<br />\nTom O'Toole battled his way to first place as he<br />\noutpointed Joe Cieslowski of Adams House, 5-2.<br />\nO'Toole who wrestled with the varsity last year behind<br />\nBill Hunt made it to the finals by pinning eventual third<br />\nplace finisher Jim Kozlowski of Royce in the semifinal<br />\nmatch. Cieslowski-who fittingly hails from Savage.<br />\nMaryland-strong-armed his way into the finals as he<br />\noverpowered two opponents on the first night of<br />\nwrestling and returned to do the same against Phi Psi's<br />\nsenior Jim Crabbs, who is a fine wrestler in his own<br />\nright.<br />\nBeta's Jim McMenamin was forced to go the point<br />\nroute to capture the 191 weight class. McMenamin, who<br />\nwon the 177 weight class last year, moved up a knotch to<br />\noutscore Gildersleeve's Bud Whalen. In the 191 semifinal<br />\nround, McMenamin had to come from behind to<br />\noutscore TEP's Ham Easter who was second to Al Jewitt<br />\nlast year. McMenamin's two points camy on a reversal<br />\nafter Easter had gone one up on an escape. He was<br />\n<br />\nrewarded with a third place finish by pinning Adams'<br />\nJohn Diorio in the consolation run-off.<br />\nKracke Pins Kahn<br />\nDropping down to the next weight class, TEP's<br />\njunior George Kracke finessed his way to the top slot at<br />\n177 when he pinned Gildersleeve's Andy Kahn. Kracke<br />\nrevenged last year's final round loss to then freshman<br />\nJim Mcmenarnin. In Friday night's semifinal matches,<br />\nKracke pinned Royce's Dave Haslunall who was forced<br />\nto wrestle twice on that night (first against Beta's John<br />\nGraham), and Kahn pinned Adams' Walt Hales. In the<br />\nconsolation match, Hashmall topped Hales.<br />\nIn the 167 weight class, another TEP Bill Margrabe<br />\nout wrestled Beta's Jon Globig, 7-0. Margrabe also had<br />\nthree minutes riding time to his credit. This was a<br />\nsurprise to many who had seen Globig take this same<br />\nweight class the year before and had also watched him<br />\ndispose of his two earlier opponents with quick pins in<br />\nthis year's competition. However Margrabe very<br />\nmethodically controlled the final match as he racked up<br />\npoints. The consolation match of the 167 weight class<br />\noffered relief of sorts as Royce's Dave Brooks outlasted<br />\nAdams' Don George, 7-6, in overtime.<br />\nGam's La Corte Victorious<br />\nCorte, Phi Gam's (un)masked<br />\nLa<br />\nBill<br />\nterror-capitalized on his previous varsity wrestling<br />\nexperience to outpoint Sig Ep's Gerry Mc Kinney (a<br />\nfinalist last year), 2-0 in 157 weight class. La Corte<br />\nmatched wits with ATO's Dave Clarke in the semifinals<br />\nand came out on top 10-6. Royce's Kirk Karwan picked<br />\nup third place honors though.<br />\nBaker's Mike MacAdams lead his houses<br />\ncontingent as he outpointed Adams' Mike Snead in the<br />\n147 category. The 137 weight class had some of the<br />\nfiercest competition of the whole tournament. Sigma<br />\nNu--the newest edition to the Hopkins athletic<br />\nscene\u2014was represented in the finals by sophomore Eric<br />\nHowland who pinned a formidable foe in Royce's Mery<br />\nGreenbaum. Last year's 137 pound winner John Lazo<br />\n<br />\nhad to settle for third place over Sig Ep's Bob<br />\nVogelsolin. Doug Seward, a scrappy little competitor<br />\nfrom Royce, garnered his team's only first place berth<br />\nwhen he outpointed Baker's Mike Klein. In the 123<br />\nweight class, TEP's goateed Frenchy Smith opened the<br />\nfinals' matches with a quick first period pin over Royce's<br />\nJim Solomon.<br />\nThe overall tournament standins with trophy<br />\npoints in parentheses are as follows: Royce 68, (40)ij<br />\nTEP 65,(43); Adams 39,(30); Baker 34,(19); Beta 25,<br />\n(26); ATO 24,(16); Gildersleeve 23,(12); Phi Gam 16,<br />\n(5); Sigma Nu 16, (6); Sig Ep 15, (5); Phi Psi 6,(-1);<br />\nJennings 4, (-1); Du 1, (2); KA 0, (1); Wood 0, (5);<br />\nWillard 0,(-1). The results of the wrestling tournament<br />\nmoves TEP to first place in the trophy standings with a<br />\n158 total. Beta moves to second place with 126, and<br />\nGam falls to third with 122. Adams still leads in the<br />\nfreshman dorms although Royce is closing the gap. The<br />\ncurrent standings in the trophy point scramble in the<br />\nfreshman dorms are: Adams, 190; Royce 174.5; Baker,<br />\n145; Gildersleeve, 137; Hollander, 116; Clark, 110;<br />\nSylvester, 102.5; Lazear, 100.5; Jennings, 84; Griffin,<br />\n78.5. Over in the UCD's, Wood leads with 110 points.<br />\nThey're followed by Willard with 99, Vincent 70, and<br />\nWilson with -10. The fraternity trophy race shapes up<br />\nlike this: TEP, 158; Beta, 126;Phi Gam, 122; KW,112;<br />\nSig Ep, Ill; DU 108; Phi Ep, 92.5; ZBT,87.5; KA,86;<br />\nSigma Nu, 76;Phi Psi, 74;Phi Sig, 65; AD,65; AEPi,65.<br />\nHardwood Action<br />\nRush has temporarily sidelined the BIA basketball<br />\ngames, but of the games that were played a week ago last<br />\nWednesday, two games stand out. ATO staved off a late<br />\nPhi Sig rally to win 36-34. ATO's Doug Hein supplied<br />\nthe winning basket with less than a minute left to play<br />\nafter Phi Sig's senior Steve Goodman had tied the game<br />\nat 34-34 with an off-balance juniper from the head of<br />\nthe key.

Lewison, chief of the Hospital's<br />\nbreast cancer clinic, will direct Hopkins involvement in<br />\nthe project. He recently returned from WHO<br />\nheadquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was<br />\nelected vice-chairman of the international breast cancer<br />\ngroup.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has also<br />\nbeen endowed $625,000 by the Independent Order of<br />\nOdd Fellows which has established a professorship in eye<br />\nresearch. The professor, Dr. Arthur M. Silverstein, is<br />\npresently studying part time on the basic reasons why<br />\ntissue transplants are rejected by the recipient.<br />\nIn a final development, the Hopkins Hospital has<br />\nannounced that it is establishing with the March of<br />\nDimes the nation's first major center to detect inherited<br />\ndefects in a baby before birth. The one year grant to the<br />\nHospital by the March of Dimes totaling $20,000 will<br />\nbegin in March. \"The scientific capability now exists for<br />\nthe detection of defects or the reassurance of normality<br />\nin a sizeable number of genetic abnormalities,\" declared<br />\nthe program head.<br />\n<br />\nRole Proposed<br />\nGovernor Mandel recently said he favored _a move<br />\nby University of Maryland students for greater<br />\nrepresentation on their Board of Regents.<br />\nBut at the same time, the Governor opposed giving<br />\na student member of the governing board a vote or voice<br />\nin policy decisions. He told newsmen, \"1 don't see<br />\nanything wrong with a representative of the student<br />\nbody sitting on the board, not as a participating member<br />\nwith the right to vote, but in some advisory capacity.\"<br />\nThe student government has been pushing for<br />\ngreater participation in university affairs, but so far has<br />\nbeen rebuffed by Dr. Wilson Elkins, the university<br />\npresident and by the regents in attempts to give the<br />\nstudent body a policy vote..<br />\n\"I think they should be entitled to participate in<br />\nthe affairs of the university as much as possible,\" Mr.<br />\nMandel explained. \"But 1 think the university should be<br />\nrun by the people whose job it is.\" Although he also<br />\ntook a stand against direct student demands, he says the<br />\nboard should listen to them. Mandel, a graduate of the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, has the power to appoint the<br />\nregents.<br />\n<br />\nHalf-Fare Dropped<br />\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) has ruled that<br />\nhalf-fare stand-by tickets for students should be<br />\neliminated.<br />\nRepresentative Arnold Olsen (D. Mont.) charged<br />\nthat elimination of airline youth fares would \"encourage<br />\nthousands of young people to resume the illegal and<br />\ndangerous practice of hitch hiking or to attempt long,<br />\nexhausting automobile trips, frequently in unsafe<br />\n<br />\nvehicles.\" He argued that no one would benefit from a<br />\ndiscontinuation of youth fares.<br />\nUrging continued emphasis on education, Olsen<br />\ncited the air fare as \"an important factor in easing the<br />\ntravel burden of thousands of college students.\" Olsen<br />\nasserted that \"strict, imprudent application of the<br />\nnon-discrimination ruling would threaten half-fare<br />\ntickets for youngsters between 2, and 12 years of age<br />\n(reservations can be made for such tickets), for military<br />\npersonnel, and several other special fare categories now<br />\nproperly and prudently provided by the airlines.\"<br />\nThe CAB ruling, written by Examiner Arthur S.<br />\nPresent, judged the special fare discriminatory to adult<br />\npassengers. If upheld by the five-member Board, youth<br />\nfares will be dropped in 30 days. In a letter to CAB<br />\nChairman John H. Crooker, Olsen asked that the<br />\nTuesday decision be reviewed and rescinded.<br />\n<br />\nCollege Reforms Set<br />\nMore than 40 bills averaging over two a day were<br />\nintroduced last month in the California legislature all<br />\naimed at denying to various extents the freedom of state<br />\ncollege administrators or students.<br />\n0ne bil1 presented would require a college<br />\npresident to dismiss a faculty member or student who<br />\ntook part in campus disruption.

A third proposal would remove<br />\nthe ex offico regents who hold office because of their<br />\nelective position.<br />\nState Senator, John Schimitz of Orange County, a<br />\nJohn Birch Society member,said to his constituents in a<br />\nnewsletter last week, \"Let's call their bluff.\" He would<br />\nclose colleges where disruptions occur.<br />\nMeanwhile, at San Francisco State, President S.I.<br />\nHayakawa, offered last week to rehire the 199 striking<br />\nteachers when the college hopes to reopen on February<br />\n17.<br />\nDr. Hayakawa praised Governor Ronald Reagan's<br />\naction in designating the University of California<br />\nBerkeley campus as an emergency disaster area and<br />\ndispatching State highway patrolmen there to help keep<br />\norder.

He felt, however, that the News-Letter<br />\ndoesn't fulfill its obligation as a campus newspaper. The<br />\nOdyssey is an attempt to do something about the lack of<br />\ncommunity on campus, Nordheim said.<br />\nAlthough the paper has received $800 from the<br />\nS.A.C., probably only two issues of the Odyssey will<br />\nappear this year, due to the lack of advertising revenue<br />\nso far. Nordheim further noted that Business Manager<br />\nJohn Ullman was having trouble raising ad revenue<br />\nbecause of the newness of the paper.

LXXIII NO. 14<br /><br />\nCalendar Reform Could Begin by Next Year<br />\nBy RICK DILLMAN<br /><br />\nAfter nearly twenty years of discussion<br />\nabout needed reform it now appears that<br />\nHopkins is on the verge of producing a real<br />\nchange in its academic calendar.<br />\nIn the fall of 1968 an Ad Hoc Committee<br />\nwas established by President Gordon to study<br />\nPossible methods of co-ordinating the programs<br />\nof the School of Hygiene and Public Health, the<br />\nMedical School, and Homewood Campus.<br />\nCurrently the Medical and Health Institutions<br />\noperate on a quarterly schedule while<br />\nHomewood uses a semester system. This<br />\nsituation makes the scheduling of inter-school<br />\nclasses difficult if not impossible. The purpose<br />\nof the Committee was to examine the situation<br />\nand recommend a solution which would, in the<br />\nwords of Chaiiman Dr. William Bevin, \"achieve<br />\nunity among the different branches of the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nAlthough the Committee will not vote on<br />\nthes final draft of the proposal until next<br />\nTuesday, the general outlines and goals are now<br />\nit '<br /><br />\nI AP.<br /><br />\nMedical and Health Institutions with the two<br />\n\"four\" sections. It should also be noted that the<br />\nplan may contain the beginnings of a solution to<br />\nanother long discussed problem\u2014that of closer<br />\nco-operation between Hopkins and Goucher.<br />\nThe organization of Goucher's trimester system<br />\nsystem is such that it would not take much<br />\nadjusting to transform it into a four-one-four<br />\ntype of schedule. Tentative negotiations<br />\nbetween the two administrations have been in<br />\nprogress for several months, and it is sure that<br />\nGoucher is watching the present proceedings<br />\nwith ipterest.<br />\nIf the Ad Hoc Committee reports the plan<br />\nout favorably at its Tuesday meeting, it will be<br />\nup to President Gordon to make the next move.<br />\nUpon his approval copies of the report will be<br />\nsubmitted to Homewood's Academic Council<br />\nand similar bodies of every branch of the<br />\nUniversity. If approval of these groups is secured<br />\nquickly, there is a strong possibility that the<br />\nplan would go into effect as early as next year.<br />\n(Continued to Page 13)<br /><br />\nWorkers Demand Grievance Committee<br /><br />\nih<br />\n#<br /><br />\nknown. The basic conclusion will be that the<br />\nUniversity's best interests would be served by<br />\nthe adoption of a four-on-four type plan.<br />\nIn brief, the plan postulates two<br />\napproximately four month long periods to be<br />\nseparated by a single one month period. The<br />\nfirst \"four\" would begin in early September and<br />\nterminate with the start of Christmas Vacation.<br />\nThis part of the plan would eliminate the much<br />\ncriticized two week \"dead\" period between New<br />\nYear's and the start of finals<br />\nJanuary would be the \"one\" section and<br />\nwould serve as a sort of mini-semester to be used<br />\nfor seminars and informal or independent study.<br />\nAlthough no solid proposal has been made,it<br />\nmay be recommended that the mini-semester be<br />\nmade mandatory for freshmen and sophomores<br />\nwith juniors and seniors having the option of<br />\ntaking the month off.

Taylor, Plant Manager,<br />\nand Joseph Rumberger, Director of<br />\nPersonnel Services, jointly announced<br />\nthat, as of February 3, all minimum<br />\nsalaties were raised from $1.46 perhour<br />\nto $1.60 per hour. \"Wage reviews are a<br />\ncontinuing process,' Taylor and<br />\nRumberger said, \"and it is anticipated<br />\nthat further raises, on an individual<br />\nbasis, will be made.\"<br />\nGeorge Weinbach, Assistant to the<br />\nPlant Manager, felt that the \"raise had<br />\nbeen in the works for quite a while, and<br />\nwas merely the result of continual<br />\nreviews of the situation.\"<br />\nNot Just Wages<br /><br />\nROBERT PINKERTON\u2014\"The best of that<br />\nWhitehead Hall Crew\"<br /><br />\nWalker, however, felt that the<br />\nraise was an attempt to stifle the<br />\ngrowing unrest among the univeristy<br /><br />\nworkers over low wages and unresolved<br />\ngrievances. The attempt would be futile,<br />\nhe added, since \"our grievances are not<br />\nsolely in the area of wages; and even the<br />\niwage issue has not been resolved to our<br />\ntotal satisfaction.\"<br />\nTo achieve a living wage for the,<br />\nworkers, he maintains that a $.15 an<br />\nshour increase would be in order for all<br />\nworkers, and not just starting workers.<br />\nThe increases for workers already<br />\non the payroll was miniscule in<br />\ncomparison to the increase for those<br />\njust hired.<br />\nInitially, Walker experienced great<br />\ndifficulty in obtaining the signatures of<br />\nthe older employees on the grievance<br /><br />\ncommittee petition, since most felt that<br />\nthey would lose their jobs if they signed<br />\nsuch a petition.<br />\nThey based this belief on<br />\nincidents in previous years when<br />\npressure was supposed to have been<br />\nexerted on the workers, when they had<br />\nattempted to organize. This pressure<br />\nseemed to have been exerted from<br />\nWhitehead, and again took the form of<br />\nthreatened loss of jobs.<br />\nIt was only when the older<br />\nemployees saw that Walker was not<br />\nbeing fired for his part in organizing<br />\nthem that they felt safe enough to sign<br />\nthe petition.<br />\n(Continued to Page 14)<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nMIT \"Research Stoppage\"<br />\nStrike Spreads to Hopkin!<br />\nA plan for a one-day \"research<br />\nstoppage\" on March 4 to protest<br />\ngovernment \"misuse of science\" has<br />\nspread to Hopkins.<br />\nThis movement was begun at<br />\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology<br />\nand has also taken hold at Yale and<br />\nCornell.

A<br />\nnew one was needed, according to<br />\nCouncil president Russ Passarella,<br />\nbecause the \"old constitution obviously<br />\nwasn't being followed\" and \"something<br />\nwas drastically wrong.\"<br />\nEmbodied in the new constitution<br />\nis a limitation on how much the<br />\nyearbook may spend. All expenditures<br />\nover $50 have to be approved by the<br />\nbook's Board of Control and the<br />\npresident of the SAC. This was done<br />\nbecause the last two yearbooks, for the<br />\nonly time in the history of the<br />\nHullabaloo, lost money. Senior class<br />\nfunds must make up any deficit<br />\nincurred.<br />\nRegular Meetings<br />\nThe document was accepted as<br />\nproposed, except for one change in the<br />\nrules governing the Board of Control<br />\nsessions. The Hullabaloo's officers must<br />\nmeet weekly during the second semester<br />\nand bi-weekly during the first.<br />\nSix of the seven-man Board of<br />\nControl were accepted by the Student<br />\nCouncil without debate. They are:<br />\nCrawford, editor-in-chief; Ken Locker,<br />\nphotography editor; Roger Moose,<br />\ncampus editor; Allan Rubeo, business<br />\nmanager; John Globig, SAC<br />\nrepresentative; and Dave Wirtz, senior<br />\nclass representative.<br />\nThe appointment of John Adams<br />\nas executive editor was protested bY<br />\nCrawford, who suggested Joel Ziskin in<br />\nhis stead. Ziskin is a junior who has<br />\nworked for the Hullabaloo, literary<br />\nmagazine, Baltimore Free Press, and the<br />\nNews-Letter. His nomination was voted<br />\ndown 5-3 with five abstentions, and<br />\nAdams was accepted. A sophomore<br />\ntransfer student from Virginia Military<br />\nInstitute, Adams has worked on<br />\nyearbooks at his high school and<br />\nprevious college. Passarella stated that<br />\n\"knowledge of how a yearbook is done<br />\nis what is important,\" not length of<br />\nattendance at Hopkins. Adams has been<br />\nhere since September.<br />\n\"Unconstitutional\"<br />\nWording in parts of the<br />\nconstitution is unclear, in the opinion of<br />\nCrawford. The executive editor has been<br />\ngiven total control over the yearbook's<br />\nlayout, but it is not specified as to<br />\nwhether the Board of Control or the<br />\neditor-in-chief can override his<br />\ndecisions.<br />\nBelieving that the Student<br />\nCouncil's action was \"unconstitutional<br />\nfrom every aspect,\" Crawford declared<br />\nthat the Council was not empowered to<br />\nestablish a constitution for an<br />\nextracurricular activity. He interprets it<br />\nas a \"purely political move.\"<br />\nIn defense of the Council,<br />\npresident Passarella stated that its<br />\nconstitution gives it the responsibilitY<br />\nfor all organizations on campus, a<br />\ndelegation of power that he contrues to<br />\ninclude supervision over the by-laws of<br />\nthose organizations. There are no<br />\nprecedents.<br />\nStating that his power as<br />\neditor-in-chief is \"non-existent,''<br />\nCrawford asserted that \"I really have<br />\nvery little influence with the Board of<br />\nControl\". In his opinion the future of<br />\nthe Hullabaloo is very dim. \"The 1969<br />\nyearbook isn't even going to be worth<br />\nreading,\" he said. According to him, it<br />\nwill be \"a return to the pre-high school<br />\nsyndrome ...a book without anY,<br />\nredeeming artistic content whatsoever:<br />\nIt will be extremely dull as far as layout<br />\ngoes.\"<br />\n.; \u2022<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,FEB. 14, 1969<br /><br />\nPAGE 3<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nS.A.

In<br />\naddition to such a relationship, Smith tried to adopt a<br />\n\"block\" tactic attracting ghetto dwellers from the same<br /><br />\nJOE WEINBERG, president of the Student Association,<br />\ndiscusses the SA's Urban programs.<br /><br />\narea.

Few<br />\nstudents had the necessary time to devote to such a<br />\nprogram.<br />\n\"Because of these difficulties we have to make the<br />\nprogram more relevant and workable,\"stated Smith.<br />\nAPO is not the only campus organization to call<br />\nfor a \"more relevant and workable\" program, however.<br />\nMichael Amey, president of the Urban Affairs Council,<br />\nlamely stated that the UAC has been in a \"transitionary<br />\nstage\" during the last semester, attempting to reorganize<br />\ntheir program. Plans for such \"reorganization\" are as yet<br />\nuncertain.<br />\nThe difficulties facing APO and the Urban Affairs<br />\nCouncil are characteristic of some but not tall of the<br />\ncampus programs.

Although all groups began the semester with<br />\nsubstantial ideas and the hopes of expanding those ideas<br />\ninto workable programs, not all were successful. The<br />\nStudents' Opportunities in the Inner City, for example,<br />\nhas been cancelled by its chairman, Martin Hickey.<br />\nHickey indicated that the program was unable to draw<br />\nstudent interest or find the necessary information.<br />\nThe Myth of Student Apathy<br />\nAs one of the reasons for the organizational<br />\ndifficulties both Amey and Smith, along with Mike<br />\nRosenberg of the Community Involvement Board cited<br />\nstudent apathy as a major factor in the difficulties their<br />\nprograms were facing. Smith stated, for example, that<br />\n\"it is very difficult for undergraduates to get involved,<br />\nbasically a Hoppy does what the Establishment tells him<br />\nto do.\"<br />\nThis attitude, although prevelant on Homewood<br />\ncampus, has little factual support. AWARE has close to<br />\n40 students participating in the program and Archibald<br />\nis confident that the number can be expanded; S.A.<br />\ntutoring has 175 students tutoring and Wickwire hopes<br /><br />\nthat even that number may be expanded. In all, nearly<br />\n10% of the undergraduate body, participates in<br />\nHomewood tutoring activities.<br />\nS.A. President Joe Weinberg stated that this makes<br />\nthe Homewood campus one of the more active campuses<br />\nin the nation. The major difficulty, therefore, is not in<br />\nmotivating thes students but in attracting them to<br />\nspecific projects.<br />\n\"It isn't so much a question of having a vague<br />\nprogram that you want to do and then asking students<br />\nto help you firgure it out,\" said Archibald,\"You have to<br />\nbe able to present the students with a plan, you have to<br />\nbe able to tell them what you want to do. If you can't<br />\ndo that you'll never get sutdents to work, they'll go to<br />\nother projects.\"<br />\nNeed For Coordination<br />\nIn light of the success of both AWARE and the<br />\nS.A. tutoring, it appears that coordinated planning for<br />\nthe individual projects is essential. It becomes impossible<br />\njust to \"want to tutor\" or \"want to help educate others\"<br />\nabout the inner city without some idea of direction.<br />\nOriginally this coordination was to be<br />\naccomplished by the Community Involvement Board.<br />\nStudents interested in working in the Inner City or in<br />\ncommunity related projects were to go to the C. I. B.<br />\nand, from there, to the specific programs which<br />\ninterested them. Unfortunately, such a OP suffered<br />\nfrom several difficulties.<br />\nOne of the major problems was that few people<br />\nknow exactly what the other organizations were trying<br />\nto accomplish. Only a few of the programs had specific<br />\nprograms outlined.<br />\nSimilarly not everyone was willing to work with<br />\nthe CIB. Francis Smith stated \"I don't really see what<br />\ngood coordination would do.\" He indicated that he felt<br />\nthe CIB was \"administratively bogged down.\"<br />\nThere is also an overlap between organizations so<br />\nthat students were never clear about the realtionships<br />\nbetween the various organizations. Martin Hickey,<br />\npresident of the Student Opportunities in the Inner City<br />\nstated that his organization to a large extent duplicated<br />\nthe work of the CIB. Hickey and Rosenberg discovered<br />\nduplication when they happened to meet at Freshman<br />\norientation.<br />\nAlthough these difficulties are facing present:<br />\nprograms at Homewood, the outlook is not totally<br />\nbleak. There are presently the beginnings of some<br />\nattempt at closes-coordination between inner city<br />\nprograms.<br />\nNevertheless, stated Hickey, \"with nothing<br />\norganized and nobody knowing what is going on, city<br />\ninvolvement is dead.\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,FEB. 14, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nCommission Links Students<br />\nTo Sharp Rise of Violence<br />\nWASHINGTON (CPS)\u2014A preliminary<br />\nreport of the National Commission on the<br />\nCauses and Prevention of Violence says that<br />\nyoung people provide the \"thrust\" of much of<br />\nthe group protest and collective violence in the<br />\nghetto, in the streets, and on the campuses.<br />\n\"The key to much of the violence in our society<br />\nseems to lie with the young,\" says the report, which the<br />\ncomission calls \"only tentative, a first look, and subject<br />\nto revision.\"<br />\nThe final report and recommendations are due in<br />\nthe spring; investigation will continue till then: \"It may<br />\nbe with tomorrow's generation that much of the<br />\nemphasis of our studies and the national response should<br />\nlie.\"<br />\nFrustrated by System<br />\nThe observation about youth is one of 10 \"themes<br />\nof challenge\" for Americans listed by the report.<br />\nAnother notes that \"violent protest today...has occurred<br />\nin part because protesters believe they cannot make their<br />\ndemands felt effectively through normal, approved .<br />\nchannels and that 'the system,' for whatever reasons, has<br />\nbecome unresponsive to them.\"<br />\nThe report also mentions \"additional<br />\ncomplications\" that arise from \"the high visibility\" of<br />\nboth violence and social inequities through the mass<br />\nmedia. The media may \"aggravate\" problems of<br />\ncontrolling violence, but they can also be \"useful social<br />\nagents...helping to reduce levels of violence,\" the report<br />\nsaid.<br />\nThe violence commission was established last June<br />\nby President Johnson \"to undertake a penetrating isearch\"<br />\nfor the causes and prevention of disorder. Under<br />\nChairman Milton S. Eisenhower, former President of<br />\nHopkins, the commission set up task forces on historical<br />\nand comparative perspectives, individual acts of violence,<br />\nassassination, firearms, mass media,law enforcement and<br />\ngroup violence.<br /><br />\nThe study of group protest as a source of<br />\ncollective violence focuses on anti-war and anti-draft<br />\nprotest, campus unrest, black militancy, and official<br />\nresponse to such protest.<br />\nThis task force particularly is interested in why<br />\nanti-war protest, which began peacefully, has recently<br />\ninvolved violent confrontations between demonstrators<br />\nand police.<br />\n\"It is important to observe that the majority of<br />\nstudents have not been radicals or organizers of protest<br />\nimovements,\" the task force report says. \"The impetus of<br />\nthe anti-war movement seems to come basically from<br />\nyoung, middle-class, white liberals and radicals.\"<br />\nThe commission is also studying recent unrest<br />\namong black students. A fact-finding team was recently<br />\nsent to San Francisco State College.<br />\nA few years ago the extremely small minority of<br />\nblack students tended to be individualistic and mostly<br />\npolitically inactive, the report notes. \"The Black Power<br />\nMovement, however, coupled with substantial increases<br />\nin the number of black students, has offered some (of<br />\nthem) a vehicle for giving collective expression to their<br />\nparticular grievances.\"<br />\nViolence Will Stay<br />\n\"The elimination of all violence in a free society is<br />\nimpossible,\" the commission report concluded,\"But the<br />\nbetter control of illegitimate violence in our democratic<br />\nsociety is an urgent imperative, and one within our<br />\nmeans to accomplish.<br />\nIn its \"themes and challenge,\" the report notes<br />\nthat not all violence is illegitimate. \"Indeed, a major<br />\nfunction of society is the organization and legitimization<br />\nof violence in the interest of maintaining society itself.\"<br />\nSome violence may be committed by persons with<br />\nderanged minds or abnormal biological make-up, but<br /><br />\nDR.

Instead, the IFC has scheduled a rush period each<br />\nnight for the past four days of this week During this<br />\ntime, each fraternity is assigned to a different freshman<br />\n,house for an hour and can concentrate all its brothers on<br />\nthat one house.<br />\nDave Norris, President of the IFC, saw two<br />\nadvantages in this system. \"First, it will give us (the<br />\nfraternities) a chance to see every freshman in the first<br />\nweek. Second, the freshmen will get a better chance to<br />\nsee the fraternities.\" In the opinion of Mickey Bleiden,<br />\nChancellor of TEP, the new rush rules will tend to make<br />\nrush too formal. \"We will only be able to meet each<br />\nfreshman once in the first week, preventing us from<br />\ngetting them to know them as well as before,\" said<br />\nPresident Eric Herzog. However, he saw the advantage of<br />\n\"more freshmen being in their rooms because there are<br />\nno class conflicts.\"<br />\nThere was general agreement that the IFC should<br />\nsoon eliminate the no contract rule which prevents<br />\ncontact between brothers and freshmen in the first<br />\nsemester. One fraternity president said of the present<br />\nsystem, \"It puts too much pressure on the freshmen<br />\nwhen they receive invitations to dirty rush parties. The<br />\nfraternities have dirty rush parties only to keep up with<br />\nthe other fraternities.\" He felt it would be better all<br />\naround if there were regular contacts between freshmen<br />\nand fraternity men in the first semester. Eric Herzog<br />\nsuggested \"encouraging normal contact without breaking<br />\nthe rules through IFC dances, all fraternity TGIFs or<br />\npanel discussions with freshmen and brothers.\"<br />\nIt was also suggested that the freshmen go to the<br />\nfraternity houses during the first week. This plan would<br />\noffer the advantages of showing the fraternities which<br />\nfreshmen are \u2022enuinel interested in oinin: fraternities.<br /><br />\nSPARE OUR GRASS<br />\nDuring the winter months heavy foot traffic across lawn<br />\nareas often causes death to the grass.

However, the recent<br />\nmanuevrings of the Hopkins Administration (and in this group we include<br />\nStudent Council President Russell Passarella \u2014 the distinction between<br />\nhim, and say, Dr. Gordon, is negligible) compel us to do so, however<br />\nreluctantly.<br />\nAdministration members, and their undergraduate shadows on the<br />\nStudent Council, have always strongly disliked the News-Letter.<br />\nConsidering the content of our editorial opinion, this is to be expected.<br />\nYet, while we have always openly spelled out our positions, certain<br />\nmembers of the Administration, particularly Dr. Gordon, have<br />\nconsistently been less than open (we would say \"sneaky,\" but that is<br />\nimpolite) in their dealings with the News-Letter. Last year, for instance,<br />\nDr. Gordon requested that the editors of the News-Letter delete certain<br />\ncomments from an account of a talk given here by the then Governor,<br />\nSpiro Agnew. The N-L Board of Control was summoned to Dr. Gordon's<br />\nhome the .night before the issue was to appear and he reiterated his<br />\nC'request.\" When the editors refused to comply, Dr. Gordon paused,<br />\ntamped his pipe, and said that he \"would have to look into changing the<br />\nmethods by which the News-Letter staff was elected.\" The experience was<br />\nenlightening \u2014 we gained firsthand insight into the workings of a mind<br />\nwhich was a product of the United States State Department, an<br />\norganization not always reputable for its \"above-the-board\" dealings.<br />\nThe latest Administration-Student Council venture in this realm has<br />\nbeen its immediate support of the new publication, The Odyssey, due to<br />\nappear in the near future. Our intent in discussing the \"birth\" of the<br />\nOdyssey will, no doubt, be miscontrued. We feel that a second campus<br />\nnewspaper might help to provide the needed enema to enliven the<br />\nHomewood Campus. Moreover, it is apparent to us that the editors of the<br />\nOdyssey sincerely want to establish a paper to fill a void which they feel<br />\nexists on campus and not to serve as a latter day Johns Hopkins Journal.<br />\nWhat concerns us is the total lack of candor on the part of the<br />\nAdministration and Student Council as to their part in this venture.<br />\nSince 1967, two groups have approached the University seeking<br />\nfunds to put out a publication. In 1966-67, a group of freshmen wished to<br />\nstart a publication which would fill the gap left by the then-defunct<br />\nCharles Street Review. During this past semester, another group of<br />\nstudents tried to begin a social sciences version of the Vector. Both groups<br />\nwere offered little encouragement, (much less funds). In this context, it<br />\nseems more than strange that a group of undergraduates, who, whether<br />\nthey intended to or not, gave the impression that their publication would<br />\nbe \"pro-Ad ministration\" and \"pro-Student Council\" received an<br />\nimmediate promise of full funding for their first issue, a free darkroom,<br />\nand offices. In the past, the University and the Student Council have not<br />\nbeen known to be as generous with their money.<br /><br />\nWU YOU SE<br />\nVA/XOTIOC<br /><br />\nMD IF<br />\nI RE\u2014<br /><br />\nWitt (fOU 66<br /><br />\nMO IF I<br />\n1FU5E<br /><br />\nMY VAI,EISI(kC<br /><br />\nFUSE<br /><br />\nMO!<br /><br />\nIf ITS 11-1E(AST 71-1106<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nO 11,1, ifc'EAK YOU<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\nBy Permission Atlas Magazine<br /><br />\nThe whole financial picture surrounding the Odyssey confirms our<br />\nsuspicions. The Odyssey, in presenting their case to the Student Council.<br />\npledged to fund future issues completely by advertising revenue.<br />\nObviously, the Student Council and the University, in their eagerness to<br />\nsee an \"anti-News-Letter\" publication, did not even bother to thoroughly<br />\ninvestigate the Odyssey's financial future\u2014fact is, as one of the editors of<br />\nthe Odyssey confidentially admitted, that the Odyssey probably cannot<br />\nattract enough advertising revenue to subsidize even a fraction of their<br />\npublication costs.<br />\nThis fact has an interesting sidelight. At a lunch meeting between<br />\nmembers of the Administration and \"student leaders,\" Dr. Gordon told<br />\none of the News-Letter editors that he assumed that the N-L would now<br />\nhave to \"split its advertising\" with the Odyssey, (i.e., that the News-Letter<br />\nwould therefore have to curtail its own operations). When Dr. Gordon was<br />\ninformed that the N-L, holds the local franchise on national collegiate<br />\nadvertising (making national ads unavailable to the Odyssey), the good<br />\npresident exhibited a high degree of perturbation, ostensibly over the<br />\nburning issue of \"monopoly.\" It is also interesting to note that for a man<br />\nwho has had little-to-no contact with students since his inauguration Dr.<br />\nGordon has been kept assiduously posted on the Odyssey's progress.<br />\nFrom our own experience, we know that the local Baltimore<br />\nadvertising market, even should the Odyssey achieve the wildest successes,<br />\nprovides insignificant revenue. Yet, according to an editor of the Odyssey<br />\n(which is using Baltimore's most expensive printer), the paper, despite the<br />\nfinancial picutre, will definitely be going bi-weekly next year. How? The<br />\nOdyssey will ask for a sizable budget from the university(which,if they go<br />\non a bi-weekly basis will probably make their budget the largest of any<br />\nstudent organization, including the N-L) and as their editors smugly<br />\nbelieve, they will probably get what they ask for. Obviously, a far cry<br />\nfrom \"paying one's own way.\" This is related only to illustrate one point<br />\n\u2014 the manner in which Hopkins officials and student administrators<br />\noperate. One wonders why the Student Council did not investigate the<br />\nOdyssey's financial situation as throughly as they did the qualifications of<br />\nthe Black Student Union.<br />\nThus, the Administration is hopeful that its generous efforts will let<br />\nthem reap their desired reward.

For though<br />\nSHAME is a brilliant and powerful<br />\nmovie, it is a very bleak and pessimistic<br />\ncommentary on the human situation.<br />\nThe action transpires around a<br />\ncouple living alone on an unnamed<br />\nisland, caught in the rages of an<br />\nunexplained civil war. Their cottage<br />\nwalls are bare and dull, their farm is<br />\nrundown, and the ambient landscapes<br />\nare vest empty wastes. Eva (played by<br />\nLiv Ullman) and Jan Rosenberg (Max<br />\nvon Sydow) resides in this isolated<br />\nenvironment, raising and selling<br />\nlingonberries, and reminiscing over their<br />\ndays as musicians with the Philharmonic<br />\nOrchestra.<br />\nTwo major themes become<br />\napparent by the end of the movie, but<br />\nimmediately manifest is an anti-war<br />\nbias. We are presented with two armies<br />\nclashing and destroying for no given<br />\nreason at all. Bergman does not wish to<br />\ncomplicate his film with ideologies, for<br />\nthey can be disputed and debated.<br />\nPerhaps pacifism is indisputable for him.<br />\nThe soldiers themselves are<br />\nanonymous robots, whose faces are<br />\neither covered up or avoided by the<br />\ncamera. Brief but sharp vignettes of<br />\nGestapo-like brutality are recorded, and<br />\nthey sink slowly into one's memory<br />\nrather than drench it with the gory<br />\nsensationalism that other anti-war films<br />\nseem to specialize in.<br />\nThe other and more complex<br />\ntheme of SHAME is the question of<br />\ninvolvement in life and to what extent<br />\nshould the individual commit himself to<br />\nparticipation in his society. Hollis<br />\nAlpert, in a recent issue of Saturday<br />\nReview, declared that Bergman was<br />\nexpressing the collective guilt felt by<br />\nSwedes for remaining neutral during the<br />\ntwo World Wars. According to Alpert,<br />\nBerg,man's point is that non-involvement<br />\nis not possible. However, the ending is<br />\nsuch a brutal apocalyptic vision of the<br />\nfutility and frustration of life, that one<br />\nwonders why involvement per se should<br /><br />\neven be attempted.<br />\nPresents<br />\nCaptured by one side in the war,<br />\nthe Rosenbergs are thrust before a local<br />\ncommandant (played by Gunnar<br />\nBjornstrand), a friend who develops an<br />\nattachment for them. He visits their<br />\nfarm and brings them presents. In other<br />\nwords, they DO become involved.<br />\nBergman depicts the nightmare results<br />\nof this association through the use of<br />\nsymbols, the most explicit of which are<br />\nthe radio, the character of Jan<br />\nRosenberg, and the ending of the film.<br />\nThe simple radio, besides<br />\nrepresenting the technological<br />\nachievements of society, is a device<br />\nwhich conveys information of events<br />\nand personalities almost as quickly as<br />\nthey become news. For the first half of<br />\nSHAME the Rosenberg's radio isn't<br />\nworking; they are out of touch with the<br />\nworld, they do not even know what is<br />\nhappening. After their release from<br />\nprison, their interrogator (Bjornstrand)<br />\ngives them a radio; they are no longer<br />\naloof, and cannot plead ignorance. This<br />\ninvolvement, specifically with the<br />\ncommandant, brings about the<br />\nprostitution of Eva and the destruction<br />\nby fire of their small homestead.<br />\nThis analysis of Bergman's<br /><br />\nintentions is reinforced by inspection of<br />\nthe evolution in the character of Jan<br />\nRosenberg. We first see him as a<br />\nveritable apostate from life, lost from<br />\nthe track of society without any desire<br />\nto find it. He is sexually impotent,<br />\ncannot even shoot a hen at close range<br />\nto provide food, and will not run to the<br />\naid of a stranded paratrooper.<br />\nBut during his experience in<br />\ncaptivity, and shortly thereafter, he<br />\nchanges. He executes the commandant,<br />\nwho had taken advantage of Eva, his<br />\nwife. Soon the meek musician murders a<br />\nyoung deserter, just for the boy's boots.<br />\nJan has become involved.<br />\nFutility<br />\nReaching a nadir (or is it zenith?)<br />\nof cinematic pessimismin the effective<br />\nending, Bergman sums up SHAME with<br />\na harst exposition of the futility of life.<br />\nThe Rosenbergs attempt to escape in a<br />\nlarge rowboat from their island to the<br />\nmainland\u2014from bucolic isolation to the<br />\nmainstream of human existence. They<br />\nfail, and are left drifting aimlessly in the<br />\nfreezing sea, their fate unresolved but<br />\neasily imagined.<br />\nIt is possible that Bergman is uring<br />\nhis fellow man to shun the peace of<br />\nisolation and plunge into life, or at least<br /><br />\nWho Runs the Colleges?<br />\nBy JOHN HALPERIN<br />\nThe disturbances at the<br />\nUniversities of Chicago and California<br />\npoint to a thorny problem in higher<br />\neducation, a problem that is becoming<br />\nincreasingly ubiquitous every year. I<br />\nmean, of course, the problem of the<br />\nrelationship between the student and<br />\nthe university of which he is a part.<br />\nHow much power should student'<br />\nhave; There are cogent arguments on<br />\nboth sides. The \"conservative\" position<br />\nis that students, being both transient<br />\nand inconsistent, should have little to<br />\nsay about permanent aspects of<br />\nuniversity policy. They automatically<br /><br />\nsubmit themselves to university rules<br />\nand regulations when they matriculate,<br />\nand they may either abide by the<br />\nuniversity's requirements or leave. No<br />\none will force them to stay. The<br />\n\"radical\" argument is that a university is<br />\nits students\u2014no more, no less\u2014and that<br />\nthe university is thus bound to consider<br />\nstudent opinions seriously. The<br />\nuniversities, says the radical, have not<br />\nfulfilled their functions as institutions<br />\nof higher learning because they have not<br />\nresponded meaningfully to the needs<br />\nand desires of this generation of<br />\nstudents.<br />\nOf course all of this represents a<br />\ngross simplication of many complicated<br /><br />\nLocal Drama Two Poles<br />\nBy ROBIN HOLT<br />\nThe past three weeks have been<br />\nones of extemes in local theatre<br />\nconcerned with the Hopkins campus.<br />\nOn January 31, Hopkins offered its<br />\nsecond play of the season and last<br />\nThursday, Goucher assaulted the public,<br />\nwith an original dramatization of<br />\nNathanial Hawthorne's The Scarlet<br />\nLetter. But one at a time.<br />\nThe very title of Athol - Fugard's<br />\ntwo character play, The Blood Knot,<br />\ncarries with it an overwhelming visceral<br />\nodor. It represents, I think, a marked<br />\ndeparture from the tragi-comic style we<br />\nhave seen for some time now at Theatre<br />\nHopkins. The Blood Knot is a play<br />\nabout racism or, to take the more<br />\npositive angle without sounding trite,<br />\nbrotherhood. Two men, one white, one<br />\nblack, live together (sorry, all you Boys<br />\nin the Band enthusiasts, no<br />\nhomosexuality in this one) in a one<br />\nroom shack in the non-white section of<br />\nPort Elizabeth, South Africa.<br />\nEach is the other's brother in the<br />\naccustomed metaphorical sense; but in<br />\nthe course of the play we are forced to<br />\nask the prickly biological and<br />\nphilosophical question: what makes<br />\nmen brothers? The approach of Fugard<br />\nto this question is intensely sensual.<br />\nWhen Morris (Donald Hart) the white<br />\nman, puts on Zachariah's (Irving<br />\nTurner) coat he talks about getting<br />\ninside the flesh of a man when you can<br /><br />\nshowing that such isolation cannot last<br />\nfor long. Yet he also grimly portrays<br />\nwhat must inevitably come from<br />\ninvolvement. Each individual must<br />\ndecide. Is it really better to have tried<br />\nand lost than not to have tried at all?<br />\nIn a last digression, we must<br />\nquestion the rating given this film by<br />\nthe Motion Picture Association of<br />\nAmerica. SHAME received an R, which<br />\nmeans that children under the age of 16<br />\n(1 7 in some places) must be<br />\naccompanied by a parent or guardian.<br />\nThere is no apparent reason for this.<br />\nThe fleeting nudity at the very<br />\nbeginning does not last long enough for<br />\neven thes most experienced voyeur's<br />\neyelids to contract. Sex plays an<br />\nastonishingly minimal role, and nowhere<br />\neven vaguely approaches explicitness.<br />\nThere is more violence in one Road<br />\nRunner cartoon, televised to<br />\nimpressionable pre-adolescents on<br />\nSaturday morning, than in their<br />\nfeature-length movie. So why the R<br />\nrating?<br />\nPerhaps John Wayne and his<br />\nGreen Beret militarists control the<br />\nrating structure, and are afraid that the<br />\nanti-war attitude of this film will<br />\n\"corrupt\" the kill-a-Commie-for-Christ<br />\ndesires of potential cannon fodder.<br />\nSounds ridiculous, doesn't it?<br />\nYou think of a better reason.<br /><br />\nwrap yourself in the small of him.<br />\nPleasure and Pain<br />\nThe stock ingredients of<br />\nsensuality are pleasure and pain, and<br />\nFugard seems to deliver more of the<br />\nlatter. Knowledge is pain: the<br />\nknowledge that Zach gains discovering<br />\nhis pen pal is white. How can he meet<br />\nher? How can he accept this barrier? He<br />\naccepts it by giving her to Morris. This is<br />\nthe games of trading they play as<br />\nbrothers, but later their game becomes<br />\ncruel.<br />\nThey begin to play at being<br />\nhonkey and nigger and they believe<br />\ntheir roles and suddenly Morris, dressed<br />\nin Zach's fine \"white\" clothes lunges at<br />\nhis brother and begins to beat him.<br />\nAfter an hour of brotherly sentiments<br />\nthat make us feel good for humanity, all<br />\nof the latent race hatred surges up in all<br />\nits bitterness before us.<br />\nThe Blood Knot is an incredibly<br />\ngusty play. The performances of Donald<br />\nHart and Irving Turner leave the<br />\nhalf-spectator, half-participant\u2014the line<br />\nin this play is very thin\u2014utterly drained.<br />\nAnd it is a considerable accolade to the<br />\nactors and Ed Golden that one has to<br />\nrest his senses before his mind can<br />\nabsorb the thought of the\\play.<br />\nAt the other end of the theatrical<br />\nspectrum was The Scarlet Letter. There<br />\nare some books which should not be<br />\ndramatized\u2014ever. It would be a kindness<br />\nto end my review here but duty to my<br /><br />\nfellow sufferers in the audience impels<br />\nme forward. This new dramatization<br />\nwas the work of Marion Robinson, head<br />\nof the English and Drama Departments<br />\nat Goucher and it was directed by<br />\nGeorge Dowell. Any play written in<br />\neight difference scenes creates problems<br />\non continuity, but the author of this<br />\nexceptionally chewy caramel was not<br />\ncontent with that. Nevertheless, she<br />\nfailed to realize that one simply cannot<br />\nsay \"Prithee, what go here,\" to an<br />\nAmerican audience in the latter third of<br />\nthe twentieth century and get away<br />\nwith it. I mean, what is the audience<br />\ngoing to think of the past participle of<br />\n\"I trow\"\u2014I truaght?<br />\nBlah<br />\nAlthough it had all the subtlety of<br />\na falling spotlight and about the same<br />\ndegree of inspired symbolism, the scene<br />\nof Arthur. Dimesdale against the pillory<br />\nin a Christ pose did wake the audience<br />\nup and made them hope that, for a<br />\nfleeting second, this atrocity might get<br />\noff the ground (this was in the fifth<br />\nscene after the Prologue).<br />\nA final note: A Hopkins wag<br />\nwrote in the men's room at<br />\nintermission, \"Hester Prynne needs a<br />\ndiaphragm\" which sums up the<br />\nseriousness with which this play ought<br />\nto be treated. Revelation: The real sin<br />\nof The Scarlet Letter was not Hester's<br />\nadultery, but Goucher's The Scarlet<br />\nLetter.<br /><br />\nfactors, but I think these are the major<br />\nissues involved. Who should run a<br />\nuniversity\u2014the faculty or the students?<br />\nIf the faculty, how much influence<br />\nshould students have upon its decisions?<br />\nIf the students, why have faculties at<br />\nall?<br />\nMy own opinion is that both sides<br />\nare both right and wrong, but that the<br />\nradical students\u2014at least the ones at<br />\nChicago and California\u2014are more in the<br />\nwrong than the university<br />\nadministrations themselves. It is true<br />\nthat at some universities changes are<br />\nneeded badly, but these should<br />\ninevitably come about with continued<br />\npressure from students. Yet student<br />\ndemands are often ridiculous. The<br />\nstudents at Chicago, for example, want<br />\namong other things a fifty-percent say<br />\nin the hiring and firing of faculty<br />\nmembers. Why did they come to the<br />\nUniversity at all if they considered<br />\nthemselves qualified as much as the men<br />\nteaching them to judge the quality of<br />\nresearch, publication, and teaching of<br />\nfaculty members? Instead of going to<br />\ncollege they should have gone to<br />\nheaven. If it is true, as they say, that<br />\nthey cannot be taught by men who<br />\nwent to school in the Thirties, then why<br />\nenter the University at all? Why not<br />\nsimply teach each other? These radical<br />\nstudents are of course a small minority,<br />\nbut they represent, to me at least, the<br />\nsort of exorbitant nihilism that could<br />\nwell wreck our greatest universities,<br />\nbeset as they already are by a lack of<br />\nfunds due to several consecutive<br />\nnational administrations more interested<br />\nin killing children than in educating<br />\nthem.<br />\nConflict in Values<br />\nThese same students at Chicago,<br />\nseveral years ago, occupied the<br />\nadministration building after the<br />\nUniversity decided that while it would<br />\nnot disclose grades to draft boards if<br />\nstudents requested them not to, it<br />\nwould disclose them upon the request<br />\nof the student. The radicals demanded<br />\nthat the University agree not to disclose<br />\nclass standing even at the student's own<br />\nrequest, which would of course have<br />\nbeen a blatant encroachment upon the<br />\nrights of those who wanted to use their<br />\nclass standing as a protection from the<br />\ndraft. That confrontation was settled<br />\nwhen the radicals were finally convinced<br />\n(Continued to Page 9)<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER \u2014<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEB. lt4 19'6\u00a7\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nLawandOrdure: PilferedPaper<br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nFingertips on table: tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap<br />\nSomebody has apparently stolen my paper.<br />\nShouldn't mind, it was already graded, graded and left in<br />\nan open box in front of the History Office, box labeled<br />\n\"War in the Modern World\" containing several other<br />\npapers (many of which were also stolen) and all final<br />\nexams for the course.

And they haven't made many.<br />\nSince the last issue of the paper, they<br />\nhave won three out of the four meets they have<br />\nwrestled. The Jays defeated Dickinson 19-12,<br />\nLoyola 28-10, and Towson State, 29-9, and<br />\nonly lost to Haverford 13-20.<br />\nThe attitude of the matmen against<br />\nQickinson was relaxed and determined.

Dryden lost to Delaware<br />\nin the previous match. Stan Konefal won by<br />\ndecision, Jeff Parker registered another pin, and<br />\nBob Hyams decisioned his foe.<br />\nThe past two victories over Loyola and<br />\nTowson State have been due to three major<br />\nfactors: Hopkins was in better condition, had<br />\nthe wrestlers with the better ability, and<br />\nthirdly, and most important, they had more of<br />\na desire to win.<br />\nThe wins were largely due to the fact that<br />\nthe team's physical condition did not suffer to<br />\nany great extent because of the examination<br />\nperiod and intersession. Voluntary practice<br />\nsessions were held during exams and regular<br />\npractices started on the 27th of January. The<br />\nwrestlers, mostly on their own initiative, would<br />\nwork out at least once a day when they didn't<br />\nhave an exam.<br />\nEight in a Row<br />\nThe Blue Jays won the first eight matches<br />\nagainst the Greyhounds of Loyola.

Betta was never<br />\nbehind.<br />\nLoyola, frightened by Jeff Parker's<br />\namazing pinning ability, decided to forfeit 145<br />\nlb. class, and let their regular 145 pounder<br />\nwrestler go against Monte Ikemire at 152.<br />\nIkemire spoiled the Hounds' strategy by<br />\ndefeating Sweren 5-2.

The PMC<br />\nteam was big and fast, and our own team helped them<br />\nalong with some inept play and bad shooting. PMC<br />\njumped out to a 17-2 lead, and was never behind,<br />\nalthough at one time in the second half Hopkins caught<br />\nup to within 8. Gary Handleman was our leading scorer<br />\nwith 22 points.

The leading scorers in this<br />\ngame were Gary Handleman and Hal Grinberg with 26<br />\napiece, and John Lally with 22. In addition coach<br />\nBarrette singled out George Apple for his exquisite ball<br />\nhandling.

For the past two years since the<br />\ntournament was made an all-school affair (combined<br />\ncompetition of fraternities, freshman houses, anc<br />\nupperclass dorms), a freshman house has walked off with<br />\nfirst place honors. Royce was this year's overall<br />\ntournament winner with 68 points. In second place with<br />\n3 out of the 9 first places to their credit was Tau Epsilon<br />\nPhi with a team score of 63. Adams was third overall in<br />\nthe tournament and second among the freshman house:<br />\nwith 39 points. Second among the fraternities was Beta.<br />\nHaving entered eight of the nine weight classes.<br />\nRoyce managed to place all but one of these into the<br />\nsemifinal rounds on Friday night. Adams and TEF<br />\nfollowed closely with 5 each in the semifinals, and then<br />\ncame ATO, Phi Psi, and Gildersleeve all with three<br />\napiece: Although there were not as many participants in<br />\nthis year's tournament as in past years, there still were<br />\nmany contested weight classes.<br />\nIn the heavyweight division, Alpha Tau Omega's<br />\nTom O'Toole battled his way to first place as he<br />\noutpointed Joe Cieslowski of Adams House, 5-2.<br />\nO'Toole who wrestled with the varsity last year behind<br />\nBill Hunt made it to the finals by pinning eventual third<br />\nplace finisher Jim Kozlowski of Royce in the semifinal<br />\nmatch. Cieslowski-who fittingly hails from Savage.<br />\nMaryland-strong-armed his way into the finals as he<br />\noverpowered two opponents on the first night of<br />\nwrestling and returned to do the same against Phi Psi's<br />\nsenior Jim Crabbs, who is a fine wrestler in his own<br />\nright.<br />\nBeta's Jim McMenamin was forced to go the point<br />\nroute to capture the 191 weight class. McMenamin, who<br />\nwon the 177 weight class last year, moved up a knotch to<br />\noutscore Gildersleeve's Bud Whalen. In the 191 semifinal<br />\nround, McMenamin had to come from behind to<br />\noutscore TEP's Ham Easter who was second to Al Jewitt<br />\nlast year. McMenamin's two points camy on a reversal<br />\nafter Easter had gone one up on an escape. He was<br /><br />\nrewarded with a third place finish by pinning Adams'<br />\nJohn Diorio in the consolation run-off.<br />\nKracke Pins Kahn<br />\nDropping down to the next weight class, TEP's<br />\njunior George Kracke finessed his way to the top slot at<br />\n177 when he pinned Gildersleeve's Andy Kahn. Kracke<br />\nrevenged last year's final round loss to then freshman<br />\nJim Mcmenarnin. In Friday night's semifinal matches,<br />\nKracke pinned Royce's Dave Haslunall who was forced<br />\nto wrestle twice on that night (first against Beta's John<br />\nGraham), and Kahn pinned Adams' Walt Hales. In the<br />\nconsolation match, Hashmall topped Hales.<br />\nIn the 167 weight class, another TEP Bill Margrabe<br />\nout wrestled Beta's Jon Globig, 7-0. Margrabe also had<br />\nthree minutes riding time to his credit. This was a<br />\nsurprise to many who had seen Globig take this same<br />\nweight class the year before and had also watched him<br />\ndispose of his two earlier opponents with quick pins in<br />\nthis year's competition. However Margrabe very<br />\nmethodically controlled the final match as he racked up<br />\npoints. The consolation match of the 167 weight class<br />\noffered relief of sorts as Royce's Dave Brooks outlasted<br />\nAdams' Don George, 7-6, in overtime.<br />\nGam's La Corte Victorious<br />\nCorte, Phi Gam's (un)masked<br />\nLa<br />\nBill<br />\nterror-capitalized on his previous varsity wrestling<br />\nexperience to outpoint Sig Ep's Gerry Mc Kinney (a<br />\nfinalist last year), 2-0 in 157 weight class. La Corte<br />\nmatched wits with ATO's Dave Clarke in the semifinals<br />\nand came out on top 10-6. Royce's Kirk Karwan picked<br />\nup third place honors though.<br />\nBaker's Mike MacAdams lead his houses<br />\ncontingent as he outpointed Adams' Mike Snead in the<br />\n147 category. The 137 weight class had some of the<br />\nfiercest competition of the whole tournament. Sigma<br />\nNu--the newest edition to the Hopkins athletic<br />\nscene\u2014was represented in the finals by sophomore Eric<br />\nHowland who pinned a formidable foe in Royce's Mery<br />\nGreenbaum. Last year's 137 pound winner John Lazo<br /><br />\nhad to settle for third place over Sig Ep's Bob<br />\nVogelsolin. Doug Seward, a scrappy little competitor<br />\nfrom Royce, garnered his team's only first place berth<br />\nwhen he outpointed Baker's Mike Klein. In the 123<br />\nweight class, TEP's goateed Frenchy Smith opened the<br />\nfinals' matches with a quick first period pin over Royce's<br />\nJim Solomon.<br />\nThe overall tournament standins with trophy<br />\npoints in parentheses are as follows: Royce 68, (40)ij<br />\nTEP 65,(43); Adams 39,(30); Baker 34,(19); Beta 25,<br />\n(26); ATO 24,(16); Gildersleeve 23,(12); Phi Gam 16,<br />\n(5); Sigma Nu 16, (6); Sig Ep 15, (5); Phi Psi 6,(-1);<br />\nJennings 4, (-1); Du 1, (2); KA 0, (1); Wood 0, (5);<br />\nWillard 0,(-1). The results of the wrestling tournament<br />\nmoves TEP to first place in the trophy standings with a<br />\n158 total. Beta moves to second place with 126, and<br />\nGam falls to third with 122. Adams still leads in the<br />\nfreshman dorms although Royce is closing the gap. The<br />\ncurrent standings in the trophy point scramble in the<br />\nfreshman dorms are: Adams, 190; Royce 174.5; Baker,<br />\n145; Gildersleeve, 137; Hollander, 116; Clark, 110;<br />\nSylvester, 102.5; Lazear, 100.5; Jennings, 84; Griffin,<br />\n78.5. Over in the UCD's, Wood leads with 110 points.<br />\nThey're followed by Willard with 99, Vincent 70, and<br />\nWilson with -10. The fraternity trophy race shapes up<br />\nlike this: TEP, 158; Beta, 126;Phi Gam, 122; KW,112;<br />\nSig Ep, Ill; DU 108; Phi Ep, 92.5; ZBT,87.5; KA,86;<br />\nSigma Nu, 76;Phi Psi, 74;Phi Sig, 65; AD,65; AEPi,65.<br />\nHardwood Action<br />\nRush has temporarily sidelined the BIA basketball<br />\ngames, but of the games that were played a week ago last<br />\nWednesday, two games stand out. ATO staved off a late<br />\nPhi Sig rally to win 36-34. ATO's Doug Hein supplied<br />\nthe winning basket with less than a minute left to play<br />\nafter Phi Sig's senior Steve Goodman had tied the game<br />\nat 34-34 with an off-balance juniper from the head of<br />\nthe key.

Gains Dean<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nDr. Julius R. Krevans, professor of medicine at the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University of Medicine and<br />\nphysician-in-chief at Baltimore City Hospitals, will<br />\nbecome dean for academic affairs at the school of<br />\nmedicine as of July 1.<br />\nDr. David E. Rogers, vice president for medicine<br />\nand dean of the medical faculty at Hopkins said Dr.<br />\nKrevans in the newly created post will give a point of<br />\nfocus to all educational activities of the school<br />\nAs a key member of Dr. Roger's administrative<br />\nstaff, Dr. Krevans will assume broad responsibility for<br />\nthe development of educational policies, including<br />\npost\u2014doctoral education and curriculum development.<br />\nAs one of the first tasks, Dr. Rogers said, Dr.<br />\nKrevans will pull together the output of the various<br />\nstudent and faculty groups working on the school of<br />\nmedicines curriculum, in planning for comphrensive<br />\nchanges for the future.<br />\n\"We hope his appointment as dean for academic<br />\naffairs will enable Hopkins to take an imaginative new<br />\napproach to the whole spectrum of medical education,<br />\nfrom the first year of college through the total period of<br />\npost-doctoral study,\" said Dean Rogers.<br /><br />\nWHO Selects .111H<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Hospital has been selected by<br />\nthe United Nation's World Health Organization as the<br />\nonly U.S. hospital to aprticipate as a collaborating center<br />\nin a WHO clinical study of breast cancer which will begin<br />\nthis year.<br />\nDr. Edward F. Lewison, chief of the Hospital's<br />\nbreast cancer clinic, will direct Hopkins involvement in<br />\nthe project. He recently returned from WHO<br />\nheadquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was<br />\nelected vice-chairman of the international breast cancer<br />\ngroup.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has also<br />\nbeen endowed $625,000 by the Independent Order of<br />\nOdd Fellows which has established a professorship in eye<br />\nresearch. The professor, Dr. Arthur M. Silverstein, is<br />\npresently studying part time on the basic reasons why<br />\ntissue transplants are rejected by the recipient.<br />\nIn a final development, the Hopkins Hospital has<br />\nannounced that it is establishing with the March of<br />\nDimes the nation's first major center to detect inherited<br />\ndefects in a baby before birth. The one year grant to the<br />\nHospital by the March of Dimes totaling $20,000 will<br />\nbegin in March. \"The scientific capability now exists for<br />\nthe detection of defects or the reassurance of normality<br />\nin a sizeable number of genetic abnormalities,\" declared<br />\nthe program head.<br /><br />\nRole Proposed<br />\nGovernor Mandel recently said he favored _a move<br />\nby University of Maryland students for greater<br />\nrepresentation on their Board of Regents.<br />\nBut at the same time, the Governor opposed giving<br />\na student member of the governing board a vote or voice<br />\nin policy decisions. He told newsmen, \"1 don't see<br />\nanything wrong with a representative of the student<br />\nbody sitting on the board, not as a participating member<br />\nwith the right to vote, but in some advisory capacity.\"<br />\nThe student government has been pushing for<br />\ngreater participation in university affairs, but so far has<br />\nbeen rebuffed by Dr. Wilson Elkins, the university<br />\npresident and by the regents in attempts to give the<br />\nstudent body a policy vote..<br />\n\"I think they should be entitled to participate in<br />\nthe affairs of the university as much as possible,\" Mr.<br />\nMandel explained. \"But 1 think the university should be<br />\nrun by the people whose job it is.\" Although he also<br />\ntook a stand against direct student demands, he says the<br />\nboard should listen to them. Mandel, a graduate of the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, has the power to appoint the<br />\nregents.<br /><br />\nHalf-Fare Dropped<br />\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) has ruled that<br />\nhalf-fare stand-by tickets for students should be<br />\neliminated.<br />\nRepresentative Arnold Olsen (D. Mont.) charged<br />\nthat elimination of airline youth fares would \"encourage<br />\nthousands of young people to resume the illegal and<br />\ndangerous practice of hitch hiking or to attempt long,<br />\nexhausting automobile trips, frequently in unsafe<br /><br />\nvehicles.\" He argued that no one would benefit from a<br />\ndiscontinuation of youth fares.<br />\nUrging continued emphasis on education, Olsen<br />\ncited the air fare as \"an important factor in easing the<br />\ntravel burden of thousands of college students.\" Olsen<br />\nasserted that \"strict, imprudent application of the<br />\nnon-discrimination ruling would threaten half-fare<br />\ntickets for youngsters between 2, and 12 years of age<br />\n(reservations can be made for such tickets), for military<br />\npersonnel, and several other special fare categories now<br />\nproperly and prudently provided by the airlines.\"<br />\nThe CAB ruling, written by Examiner Arthur S.<br />\nPresent, judged the special fare discriminatory to adult<br />\npassengers. If upheld by the five-member Board, youth<br />\nfares will be dropped in 30 days. In a letter to CAB<br />\nChairman John H. Crooker, Olsen asked that the<br />\nTuesday decision be reviewed and rescinded.<br /><br />\nCollege Reforms Set<br />\nMore than 40 bills averaging over two a day were<br />\nintroduced last month in the California legislature all<br />\naimed at denying to various extents the freedom of state<br />\ncollege administrators or students.<br />\n0ne bil1 presented would require a college<br />\npresident to dismiss a faculty member or student who<br />\ntook part in campus disruption. Another would shorten<br />\nthe 16-year term for the 15 appointive regents of the<br />\nUniversity of California. A third proposal would remove<br />\nthe ex offico regents who hold office because of their<br />\nelective position.<br />\nState Senator, John Schimitz of Orange County, a<br />\nJohn Birch Society member,said to his constituents in a<br />\nnewsletter last week, \"Let's call their bluff.\" He would<br />\nclose colleges where disruptions occur.<br />\nMeanwhile, at San Francisco State, President S.I.<br />\nHayakawa, offered last week to rehire the 199 striking<br />\nteachers when the college hopes to reopen on February<br />\n17.<br />\nDr. Hayakawa praised Governor Ronald Reagan's<br />\naction in designating the University of California<br />\nBerkeley campus as an emergency disaster area and<br />\ndispatching State highway patrolmen there to help keep<br />\norder. The Acting President said that most academic<br />\nsafeguards were devised during the \"era of Senator<br />\nJoseph McCarthy.\" Now the attacks to academic<br />\nfreedom are coming from within, from the left, and<br />\nfrom the minorities below, he said.<br /><br />\nGrades Ruin Prof<br />\nDr. Arthur DuPre, who gave most of his<br />\nmathematics students A's, is apparently flunking out of<br />\nWright State University.<br />\nThe 3rd year university assistant professor from<br />\nSpartanburg, S.C., gave the A grades for the autumn<br />\nquarter to 101 of the 1 1 1 students in his algebra and<br />\ncalculus classes. \"Mathematics,\" he explained, \"is<br />\nincestuously feeding upon itself and not getting any new<br />\nideas or opinions which would disturb the established<br />\nauthority.\"<br />\nHe said the high grades\u2014he gave 10 \"incompletes\"<br />\nto students who failed to take the final exam\u2014was more<br />\nthan a protest against the grading system. \"I was telling<br />\nmy students they had earned their A's by my standards<br />\nand criteria,\" he said. \"1 had never been so impressed in<br />\nmy life.\"<br />\nThe department chairman, Carl C. Maneri, has<br />\nasked for Dr. DuPre's resignation in writing.<br /><br />\nHomewood Hosts<br />\nMulti-issue Talk<br />\nBy TED ROHRLICH<br />\nRacism, American foreign policy in Latin<br />\nAmerica and Vietnam, urban problems, the new<br />\nCongress and upcoming legislation are among<br />\nthe issues to be discussed at a conference for<br />\nstudents and faculty to be held at Homewood<br />\non Saturday, February 15.<br />\nThe theme of the one-day conference, which is<br />\nbeing sponsored by the College Program of fly; American<br />\nFriends Service Committee, Middle Atlantic Region, is<br />\n\"Shall We Build a Desert and Call It Peace?\".<br />\nDr. Arthur I.

The Senate also<br />\nvoted to appropriate $3,000 to bail out any students!<br />\nwho were arrested during the demonstration.<br />\nChancellor Edwin Young claimed that the<br />\nUniversity had already made strides in serving blacks on<br />\ncampuss through new recruiting programs and the<br />\naddition of special courses aimed at black students.<br />\nYoung also warned that nay disruption of classes<br />\nor university functions would be punished under state<br />\nlaw and university disciplinary rules.<br /><br />\nBy ART LE'VINE<br /><br />\nThe first issue of the Odyssey, a new<br />\ncampus newspaper, will appear soon after the<br />\nend of rush.<br />\nThe first issue of approximately six New York<br />\nTimes-size pages will be generally concerned with the<br />\n\"social system\" at Johns Hopkins. It will include<br />\ncolumns from representatives of major campus<br />\norganizations, feature articles, news, and photographs.<br />\nAccording to the Editor, Bill Nordheim, as many interest<br />\ngroups as possible will be represented in the new paper.<br />\nFurthermore, letters are out to 31 other colleges asking<br />\nthem to write on the social functions of their campuses.<br />\nIn an interview, Nordheim stated that the Odyssey<br />\nwas not intended to be in competition with the<br />\nNews-Letter. He felt, however, that the News-Letter<br />\ndoesn't fulfill its obligation as a campus newspaper. The<br />\nOdyssey is an attempt to do something about the lack of<br />\ncommunity on campus, Nordheim said.<br />\nAlthough the paper has received $800 from the<br />\nS.A.C., probably only two issues of the Odyssey will<br />\nappear this year, due to the lack of advertising revenue<br />\nso far. Nordheim further noted that Business Manager<br />\nJohn Ullman was having trouble raising ad revenue<br />\nbecause of the newness of the paper. Nordheim was,<br />\nhowever, optimistic about next year's prospects for the<br />\nOdyssey. \"Personally,\" he said. \"I think it could be a<br />\nvery good contribution to the campus.\"<br />\nSome of the major interests represented by<br />\ncolumns will be: The IFC, S.D.S., Black Student Union,<br />\nLincoln Gordon, The Student Council, Young<br />\nDemocrats, The Student Association, and Bill<br />\nMcQueeney.<br />\nThe final staff meeting will be held Feb. 16, and<br />\nanyone wishing to help or contribute is urged to contact<br />\nBill Nordheim, 206 Hollander or Box 2283.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40318, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "480795e9-7f4c-4a4e-9bfc-2ec2644b9c37", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13973-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13973, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "ae85cbe1-70c7-4889-9221-01d46c8ff28c", "url": "/node/13973"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "082822ad-4f0e-4e3a-a4d1-c87137af9710"}]}
