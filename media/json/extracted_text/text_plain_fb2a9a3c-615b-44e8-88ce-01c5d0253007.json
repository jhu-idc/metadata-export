Professor Nettels<br />\nhas published a work dealing with<br />\nthe economic relations of America<br />\nand Europe from 1763-1815. That his<br />\nhistorical ability has been recognized<br />\nis shown by the fact that he was<br />\na recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship on which he went to London<br />\nfor research in 1928, and also by the<br />\nfact that he was chosen as the present chairman of the program committee of the American Historical<br />\nassociation.<br />\nThe Schouler Foundation lecturers,<br />\nheld in Latrobe hall in room 120 at<br />\n5 pm are open to the public.

It might well<br />\nbe, but it is not. It is a fight<br />\nagainst a natural and perpetuating condition.<br />\nOne organization, the Student Activities commitee,<br />\nhas been delegated to control the finances of all undergraduate non-athletic activity. In controlling the finances they have quite naturally controlled policy. It<br />\nis this which we oppose.<br />\nThe SAC is not chosen by the otudent body.<br />\nIt is an appointed body, and as such it has' no- right<br />\nto the power which it exercises. Giving it such power<br />\nis a travesty on everything that extra-curricular activity stands for.<br />\nTo give a student the eight to work on an attivity<br />\nimplies that you give him the power to bulk! and<br />\ncontrol it. Without this right he has nothing.

These<br />\nactivities, and all others, are supposed to make the<br />\nplace where a college man can manage and lead. Along<br />\nwith purely mechanical functions, he is given the<br />\ndignity and the training of responsibility.<br />\nBut when you take from the activity leader or lirfellow student the power to weigh and make final decisions you have removed the dignity and training. In<br />\nshort you have defeated the very purpose of extracurricular activity.<br />\nFor this simple reason the NEWS-LETTER has always stood for student management, of finances and<br />\npolicy. We have spoken for student government because we believe it makes responsible And careftd men.<br />\nWhat we have now makes only names and titles. They<br />\nare important to little people; they mean nothing.<br />\nIt is time we changed all this and there is no<br />\nsensible argtiment for not doing so 'immediately.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER reports<br />\nthat George Frazier, DownArtie Shaw:<br />\nbeat swing critic, believes<br />\nThe Employer<br />\n'e Shaw's enlarged band<br />\nto<br />\n\"the most successful<br />\nbi<br />\nfit to date.\" Mr<br />\nFrazier has carefully reasoned tat.Mr Shaw's mttsic<br />\nians are better because they have been taken off<br />\nthe \"transparent hamburger diet\" and have,been given<br />\n\"substantial money for producing musical music.\"<br />\nThis statement has deep contemporary significance.<br />\nIt 'places Mr Shaw M. the exclusive group of employers who subscribe td' the philosophy of the very<br />\nlate Robert Owen. This gentleman, who was not a<br />\nmusician,' believed that if you give a man decent<br />\nwages and good working Conditions there is .a fiftyfifty chance that he will produce spore. Such<br />\ndangerous reasoning has since been called Communistic<br />\nand is not now universally subscribed to; witness Railroad Brotherhoods Strike, December 5, 1941. Mr .Show has been piddling with thii- dangerous<br />\n\u2022 philosophy, and Mr. Frazier thinks he has proved its<br />\nvalue.

These<br />\nactivities, and all others, are supposed to make the<br />\nplace where a college man can manage and lead.
