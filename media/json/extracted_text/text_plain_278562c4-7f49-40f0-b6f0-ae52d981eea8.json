Relating the Wyman<br />\nVilla to the initial application of<br />\nItalian Renaissance design to the<br />\narchitecture of English homes in<br />\nthe first half of the Nineteenth<br />\nCentury, Smith points out that<br />\nit is a supreme example of American adaptations of the application. Still later, In' the 1880's and<br />\n'90's, he states, \"for a new clase<br />\nof millionaires the Italian palace<br />\nof the later Renaissance was revived on a scale of proportion and<br />\nexpense undreamed of in the earlier and simpler villa days.\" These<br />\nmore extravagant buildings, it<br />\nseems, are descended in a direct<br />\nline from the original movement,<br />\nof the Civil War period, exemplified by the mansion on this<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 There are several reasons for the small minority at Hopkins.<br />\nFirst and most obvious is that Hopkins is a small school. A<br />\nminority of the 1300 students in the day school is a rather small<br />\nnumber to start with. Start cutting this figure' down and one<br />\nfinally finds that The Hopkins, in truth, can only master a small<br />\nminority. It is this intermediate group\u2014those between the onlymildly-interested majority and, the small minority\u2014that we<br />\nshould interest ourselves with. With this group lies the crux of<br />\nthe problem. If these people could be re-converted into rally:goers, which is the aim of a few campus groups, the spirit at<br />\nHotikins would proportionately equal that of many other insticampus.<br />\ntutions. But this goal, we contend, will never be reached.<br />\nHopkins<br />\nIn the face of this authoritative<br />\nthat<br />\nThe reason behind our assumption is, simply,<br />\nthere can be no question<br />\ncomment,<br />\nextrais Hopkins.

In past years no one has taken<br />\nmuch notice of the team due perhaps to what looks like a bad<br />\nrecord.<br />\nHowever, a closer inspection of this 2 won,3 tied, 4 lost record<br />\nwill prove that the team is not as bad as the record might<br />\nindicate. Their two wins combined with one loss were good<br />\nenough to put them in second place in the final standings of<br />\nthe Mason-Dixon conference. Breaks made a great deal of difference. Like the lacrosse team all but one game was settled<br />\nby a one goal margin.<br />\nLittle mistakes right from the start hurt the Jays last year.<br />\nIn their first game the team which sported six sopohomores<br />\nshowed its inexperience in losing 3-2 to Towson State Teachers<br />\nCollege, who went on to end up in fifth place in the MasonDixon conference -winning only one other game in conference<br />\nplay and losing three. Two of the three Towson goals came as a<br />\nresult of penalty kicks and spelled the difference between<br />\nvictory and defeat for Hopkins.<br />\nThe next .Nveek Hopkins pulled one of the best comebacks that<br />\nhas ever been executed in Hopkins sports history. Trailing 3-0 in<br />\nthe last period due to three penalty kick goals, the Jays would<br />\nnot give up and went on to score thrice and. tie the contest up.<br />\nWith this game under their belts Freddie Smith looked for a<br />\ngood game against a very strong F & M team but here again<br />\nsmall errors put the booters out of the game before the first half<br />\nwas ended. The first F & M goal came when the ball slipped out<br />\nof goalie Scotty Douthett's hands and was rebounded into the<br />\ncage. The second also came from a defensive slip up. In blocking<br />\na shot one of the Hopkins defenders deflected it just enough<br />\nso that it was out of the reach of Douthett's hands.<br />\nOnce again this year the team has a great potential. CoCaptain Stan Henry who was chosen last yell': to the AllMason-Dixon first string is back along with Jim Hutchins, second<br />\nstring All-American southern division. Add to this such -stars<br />\nas Gerry Williamson who despite a bad foot last year still had<br />\na good season and was given a first All-American Honorable Mention award in the south and Jerry Strauss, one of the scrappiest<br />\nfighters on the team, who was put on the second southern AllAmerican list. Buzzie Budnitz, who was very far off the forin<br />\nhe showed two years ago, neverthless was chosen to the second<br />\nstring All-Mason-Dixon team.<br />\nThese honors are not to be scoffed over lightly. This is the best<br />\nshowing that the booters have had on honorary teams for quite a<br />\nwhile and shows that individually the team should have a great<br />\npotential. Wilson Fewster is faced with the problem of knitting<br />\nthis group of stars into a team that will not make the mistakes that<br />\ncost them a majority of their games. So far he seems to be doing<br />\na pretty good job of it.<br />\nIn their first scrimmage of the year the booters upset the three<br />\ntime champions of the Mason-Dixon conference, Baltimore<br />\nUniversity, in a very well played game. Despite a loss to the same<br />\nteam less than a week later the win is still an indication of vast<br />\nimprovement. In the first scrimmage the team seemed to be<br />\nplaying the kind of ball that would win them championships<br />\nwhereas in the second game they made many mistakes and as<br />\na result were badly beaten. If they were able to leave all their<br />\nmistakes in that second scrimmage, the team could really go places.<br />\nFewster has one of the strongest attacking teams that has been<br />\nfielded here for quite a while. All the men but Ali Arman have<br />\nexperience and have showed that they have definite high scoring<br />\npotential. The two most outstanding in the group are Jim<br />\nHutchins and Buzzie Budnitz. Last year Hutchins scored in every<br />\ngame and was the backbone of the attack. Budnitz after sharing<br />\nhigh scoring honors in his sophomore year just couldn't seem to<br />\n\u201efind himself last year and though he played god ball never hit his<br />\npeak. If he should hit that peak this year the Jays would probably<br />\nstand high on Hie list of offensive soccer powers.<br />\nThe halfback line also shows experience as well as depth.<br />\nThe first three Stan Henry, Gerry Williamson, and Jerry Strauss<br />\nall played regularly last year. They are, therefore, used to each<br />\nother and should be able to form a better coordinated unit than<br />\nlast year.<br />\nEven with the experience gained by these scrimmages<br />\nthe soccer coach is still a little apprehensive of their lack of<br />\nexperience. \"The team is going to have to score three goals in our<br />\nfirst few games,\" Fewster said, \"or else I think we are going to<br />\nrun into trouble.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Bruising Betas overwhelmed KA by a 26-6 score. Displaying<br />\na well balanced offensive and defensive team, the Betas had just<br />\ntoo much power for the scrappy<br />\nKA squad. The scoring for the<br />\nBetas was accounted for l)y backs<br />\nJohn Boynton, Dick Heck, and<br />\nWayne Baillie, who tallied twice.<br />\nThe KA'-3 lone score came on the<br />\nfirst play from scrimmage when<br />\nBob Davis intercepted a Beta pass<br />\nand streaked into the end zone.<br />\nIn the second tilt of the day a<br />\nstubborn Phi Psi team succumbed<br />\nto a powerful Phi Sig aggregation<br />\nto the tune of 18-2. The brilliant<br />\nperformance turned in by the entire Phi Sigs team gave the opposition a rough time, but the hard<br />\ncharging line of the Phi Psi's was<br />\nnot to be Ignored.<br />\nIn the third tussle of the day<br />\nthe powerful Phi Ep seven took<br />\non the Alpha Delts who were un-<br />\n<br />\nFrosh Drilling For<br />\nX-Country Opener<br />\n<br />\nThe freshman cross qo untrY<br />\nable to field a team, and thereteam this year is made up nost.,<br />\nfore won by default.<br />\nly of inexperienc2d runners, the'<br />\nIn the final game of the afternoon the Atoms of ATO gave the only standout being Robin Dag<br />\n<br />\nundermanned Sig Eps a 24-0 shellacking to amass the greatest<br />\nnumber of points of the day.

But the furor aroused<br />\nby the anounced intention of razing it moved the Board of Trustees to reconsider.

Relating the Wyman<br />\nVilla to the initial application of<br />\nItalian Renaissance design to the<br />\narchitecture of English homes in<br />\nthe first half of the Nineteenth<br />\nCentury, Smith points out that<br />\nit is a supreme example of American adaptations of the application. Still later, In' the 1880's and<br />\n'90's, he states, \"for a new clase<br />\nof millionaires the Italian palace<br />\nof the later Renaissance was revived on a scale of proportion and<br />\nexpense undreamed of in the earlier and simpler villa days.\" These<br />\nmore extravagant buildings, it<br />\nseems, are descended in a direct<br />\nline from the original movement,<br />\nof the Civil War period, exemplified by the mansion on this<br /><br />\n\u2022 There are several reasons for the small minority at Hopkins.<br />\nFirst and most obvious is that Hopkins is a small school. A<br />\nminority of the 1300 students in the day school is a rather small<br />\nnumber to start with. Start cutting this figure' down and one<br />\nfinally finds that The Hopkins, in truth, can only master a small<br />\nminority. It is this intermediate group\u2014those between the onlymildly-interested majority and, the small minority\u2014that we<br />\nshould interest ourselves with. With this group lies the crux of<br />\nthe problem. If these people could be re-converted into rally:goers, which is the aim of a few campus groups, the spirit at<br />\nHotikins would proportionately equal that of many other insticampus.<br />\ntutions. But this goal, we contend, will never be reached.<br />\nHopkins<br />\nIn the face of this authoritative<br />\nthat<br />\nThe reason behind our assumption is, simply,<br />\nthere can be no question<br />\ncomment,<br />\nextrais Hopkins.

In past years no one has taken<br />\nmuch notice of the team due perhaps to what looks like a bad<br />\nrecord.<br />\nHowever, a closer inspection of this 2 won,3 tied, 4 lost record<br />\nwill prove that the team is not as bad as the record might<br />\nindicate. Their two wins combined with one loss were good<br />\nenough to put them in second place in the final standings of<br />\nthe Mason-Dixon conference. Breaks made a great deal of difference. Like the lacrosse team all but one game was settled<br />\nby a one goal margin.<br />\nLittle mistakes right from the start hurt the Jays last year.<br />\nIn their first game the team which sported six sopohomores<br />\nshowed its inexperience in losing 3-2 to Towson State Teachers<br />\nCollege, who went on to end up in fifth place in the MasonDixon conference -winning only one other game in conference<br />\nplay and losing three. Two of the three Towson goals came as a<br />\nresult of penalty kicks and spelled the difference between<br />\nvictory and defeat for Hopkins.<br />\nThe next .Nveek Hopkins pulled one of the best comebacks that<br />\nhas ever been executed in Hopkins sports history. Trailing 3-0 in<br />\nthe last period due to three penalty kick goals, the Jays would<br />\nnot give up and went on to score thrice and. tie the contest up.<br />\nWith this game under their belts Freddie Smith looked for a<br />\ngood game against a very strong F &amp; M team but here again<br />\nsmall errors put the booters out of the game before the first half<br />\nwas ended. The first F &amp; M goal came when the ball slipped out<br />\nof goalie Scotty Douthett's hands and was rebounded into the<br />\ncage. The second also came from a defensive slip up. In blocking<br />\na shot one of the Hopkins defenders deflected it just enough<br />\nso that it was out of the reach of Douthett's hands.<br />\nOnce again this year the team has a great potential. CoCaptain Stan Henry who was chosen last yell': to the AllMason-Dixon first string is back along with Jim Hutchins, second<br />\nstring All-American southern division. Add to this such -stars<br />\nas Gerry Williamson who despite a bad foot last year still had<br />\na good season and was given a first All-American Honorable Mention award in the south and Jerry Strauss, one of the scrappiest<br />\nfighters on the team, who was put on the second southern AllAmerican list. Buzzie Budnitz, who was very far off the forin<br />\nhe showed two years ago, neverthless was chosen to the second<br />\nstring All-Mason-Dixon team.<br />\nThese honors are not to be scoffed over lightly. This is the best<br />\nshowing that the booters have had on honorary teams for quite a<br />\nwhile and shows that individually the team should have a great<br />\npotential. Wilson Fewster is faced with the problem of knitting<br />\nthis group of stars into a team that will not make the mistakes that<br />\ncost them a majority of their games. So far he seems to be doing<br />\na pretty good job of it.<br />\nIn their first scrimmage of the year the booters upset the three<br />\ntime champions of the Mason-Dixon conference, Baltimore<br />\nUniversity, in a very well played game. Despite a loss to the same<br />\nteam less than a week later the win is still an indication of vast<br />\nimprovement. In the first scrimmage the team seemed to be<br />\nplaying the kind of ball that would win them championships<br />\nwhereas in the second game they made many mistakes and as<br />\na result were badly beaten. If they were able to leave all their<br />\nmistakes in that second scrimmage, the team could really go places.<br />\nFewster has one of the strongest attacking teams that has been<br />\nfielded here for quite a while. All the men but Ali Arman have<br />\nexperience and have showed that they have definite high scoring<br />\npotential. The two most outstanding in the group are Jim<br />\nHutchins and Buzzie Budnitz. Last year Hutchins scored in every<br />\ngame and was the backbone of the attack. Budnitz after sharing<br />\nhigh scoring honors in his sophomore year just couldn't seem to<br />\n\u201efind himself last year and though he played god ball never hit his<br />\npeak. If he should hit that peak this year the Jays would probably<br />\nstand high on Hie list of offensive soccer powers.<br />\nThe halfback line also shows experience as well as depth.<br />\nThe first three Stan Henry, Gerry Williamson, and Jerry Strauss<br />\nall played regularly last year. They are, therefore, used to each<br />\nother and should be able to form a better coordinated unit than<br />\nlast year.<br />\nEven with the experience gained by these scrimmages<br />\nthe soccer coach is still a little apprehensive of their lack of<br />\nexperience. \"The team is going to have to score three goals in our<br />\nfirst few games,\" Fewster said, \"or else I think we are going to<br />\nrun into trouble.\"<br /><br />\nThe Bruising Betas overwhelmed KA by a 26-6 score.
