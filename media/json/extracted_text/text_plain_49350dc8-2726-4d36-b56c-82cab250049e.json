The lectures, which<br />\ndealt with the lives and works of<br />\nColeridge and Keats, were greatly<br />\nenjoyed by large and appreciative<br />\nand<br />\nSir Walter began his first lecture<br />\nwith the statement that any study of<br />\nliterature was concerned with but<br />\ntwo things of primal importance\u2014<br />\nmen and books. It was for this reason, he continued, that he had decided not to give an introductory<br />\ntalk on the external influences that<br />\nhelped to bring about the revival,<br />\nbut had preferred to enter at once<br />\nupon the consideration of the part<br />\nplayed by one of the chief actors<br />\nin the movement\u2014Samuel Taylor<br />\nColeridge.<br />\nThe lecturer dealt first with the<br />\ncharacter of Coleridge, as revealed<br />\nin his letters. It was remarked that<br />\nthe laziness and the tendency toward plagiarism that seriously affected the poet's literary career were<br />\nclearly foreshadowed in sonic of<br />\nthese youthful epistles, for many of<br />\ntheir cleverest passages and aptest<br />\nphrases were filched outright from<br />\nletters of Thomas Gray. Coleridge's<br />\nearliest poems were then considered, and finally the period when<br />\nthe element of the supernatural was<br />\nintroduced into his work received<br />\nthe attention of the speaker. It was<br />\nat this time that the poet seemed<br />\nsuddenly to have found himself, for<br />\nall of his work that is of any great<br />\ndegree of importance was composed<br />\nduring the ten years immediately<br />\nensuing.<br />\nColeridge's relations with Wordsworth and Lamb were commented<br />\nupon, his friendship with the former being of chief importance because of the influence it exerted<br />\nupon his literary production. The<br />\nlecturer closed with an appreciation<br />\nof the work of Coleridge, and a consideration of the indebtedness of his<br />\nage and of the reading world of all<br />\nages to the great Lake poet.<br />\nThe discussion of the character<br />\nand writings of Keats was equally<br />\nadequate and appreciative. Sir<br />\nWalter first sought to dissipate the<br />\ngeneral, though erroneous, impression that the brilliant, romantic poet<br />\nwas an affected dandy like Leigh<br />\nHunt and many another of his literary contemporaries. He showed that<br />\nKeats was a man of happy disposi-<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins lacrosse team<br />\nplayed the Carlisle Indians to a<br />\n3-to-3 tie on Saturday at Homewood Field in a game lull of excitement and interest from whistle to<br />\nwhistle. The Indians, although<br />\nfighting hard for the victory, seemed<br />\nto play rather listlessly, and it was<br />\nnot until the last few minutes of the<br />\ncontest that real fighting took place.<br />\nHopkins made their first score well<br />\non ill the game, this being followed<br />\nouickly by the Indians' initial tally.<br />\nThe ball was almost constantly in<br />\nthe visitors' territory, and time and<br />\nagain the Black and Blue men shot<br />\nfor goal only to be confronted with<br />\na disappointing-looking crowd of<br />\nredskins blocking the goal. Carlisle<br />\nseemed to be playing an entirely defensive game, barring such times as<br />\nwhen they would momentarily carry<br />\nthe ball down the field and try for<br />\ngoal. It was in times like these that<br />\nthe invaluable services of Stuart, in<br />\nthe goal, and 'Huck and Brooks, his<br />\nhelpers, saved Hopkins from severe<br />\npunishment.<br />\nMany former lacrosse stars present at the game were disappointed<br />\nin the way the Hopkins men allowed<br />\nthe ball to be taken from them without a \"fight,\" but it was suggested<br />\nthat perhaps this was caused by lack<br />\nAltogether, the<br />\nof confidence.<br />\ncoaches were pleased by the showing of the team, and expect to have<br />\na well-seasoned team in condition to<br />\nmeet Navy and Pennsylvania this<br />\nweek.

He had just succeeded in<br />\nworking up a fluffy lather from a<br />\ngiant cake of soap and was about<br />\nto step under the spray when the<br />\nwater ceased to flow. He worked<br />\nawhile at the spigots, but the pipes<br />\nwere empty. Covered with soapsuds, he pondered awhile, then became indignant, and, failing to find<br />\nthe ,English language expressive, began to speak in an old Semitic<br />\ntongue, which was a great revelation, as well as shock, to his hearers.<br />\nA committee of relief offered him<br />\nthe little bit of water which remained in a drinking pail, and applying this with a ladle and by means<br />\nof a stiff piece of cardboard he<br />\nfinally cleaned off the lather, and<br />\nwent without the shower.<br />\nThe caretaker of Homewood<br />\nField said: \"The water tank is<br />\nempty; it will take two hours to fill<br />\nit. You cannot take a bath today.\"<br />\nAn inquiry into the state of affairs revealed the following facts:<br />\nThat, notwithstanding the testimony<br />\nof the caretaker, there was water in<br />\nthe tank, but that it had been turned<br />\noff until the members of another<br />\nteam, which was still at practice,<br />\nhad returned for their showers. So<br />\nthose who had been affected by the<br />\n<br />\nThe announcement of an anonymous gift of $50,000 to the University came as a delightful surprise last week. It was not definitely announced whether the money<br />\nwould be immediately available nor<br />\nwhether it could be put into that<br />\nslowly-growing fund which will enable the building of the remainder<br />\nof the University's plant on the new<br />\nHomewood estate, but the very fact<br />\nthat a Baltimorean (who does not<br />\nwish his name made public) is so<br />\ninterested in our welfare as to give<br />\nus this sum of money at a time<br />\nwhen so much is needed reminds us<br />\nagain of the fact that Baltimore is<br />\nworking with the University and<br />\nwants to see it soon housed in<br />\nits magnificent new home in the<br />\nsuburbs.<br />\nFifty thousand dollars might not<br />\nmean much to the larger universities with great endowments and<br />\nregular -donors of princely sums.\"<br />\nTo them it would he only a drop in<br />\nthe bucket. But Hopkins, because<br />\nof its youth and consequent small<br />\nbody of alumni, rarely receives a<br />\ngift of money except from some<br />\neducational foundation or under the<br />\nterms of the will of a friend. This<br />\nanonymous $50,000, then, means<br />\nmuch to the University. It brings<br />\na message of friendship and collies<br />\nat a time when the institution, perhaps more than at any other time,<br />\nneeds money. It lightens the hearts<br />\nof the men who are wrapped up in<br />\nthe \"on to Homewood\" movement.<br />\nBecause it expresses the esteem<br />\nin which the University is held by<br />\n\"A Baltimorean,\" it is encouragement ; and, because it is encouragement, it is as greatly appreciated as<br />\nthose great sums which are received<br />\nby other universities and colleges\u2014<br />\nthose large amounts which do not<br />\nmake Hopkins envious, but which<br />\nspur it on to renewed activity with<br />\nthe hope that some day it will be<br />\nin a position to call upon rich alumni<br />\nto satisfy every little wish and whim.<br />\n<br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br />\n<br />\nT.<br />\n<br />\nEx-Governor William<br />\nHaines,<br />\nof Maine, has enrolled in one of the<br />\nshort agricultural courses at the<br />\nUniversity of Maine.<br />\n* * *<br />\nTo organize the Dartmouth undergraduates into an efficient body<br />\nfor fire prevention, a student fire<br />\nsquad has been appointed by Pal2eopitus and President Nichols.

The lectures, which<br />\ndealt with the lives and works of<br />\nColeridge and Keats, were greatly<br />\nenjoyed by large and appreciative<br />\nand<br />\nSir Walter began his first lecture<br />\nwith the statement that any study of<br />\nliterature was concerned with but<br />\ntwo things of primal importance\u2014<br />\nmen and books. It was for this reason, he continued, that he had decided not to give an introductory<br />\ntalk on the external influences that<br />\nhelped to bring about the revival,<br />\nbut had preferred to enter at once<br />\nupon the consideration of the part<br />\nplayed by one of the chief actors<br />\nin the movement\u2014Samuel Taylor<br />\nColeridge.<br />\nThe lecturer dealt first with the<br />\ncharacter of Coleridge, as revealed<br />\nin his letters. It was remarked that<br />\nthe laziness and the tendency toward plagiarism that seriously affected the poet's literary career were<br />\nclearly foreshadowed in sonic of<br />\nthese youthful epistles, for many of<br />\ntheir cleverest passages and aptest<br />\nphrases were filched outright from<br />\nletters of Thomas Gray. Coleridge's<br />\nearliest poems were then considered, and finally the period when<br />\nthe element of the supernatural was<br />\nintroduced into his work received<br />\nthe attention of the speaker. It was<br />\nat this time that the poet seemed<br />\nsuddenly to have found himself, for<br />\nall of his work that is of any great<br />\ndegree of importance was composed<br />\nduring the ten years immediately<br />\nensuing.<br />\nColeridge's relations with Wordsworth and Lamb were commented<br />\nupon, his friendship with the former being of chief importance because of the influence it exerted<br />\nupon his literary production. The<br />\nlecturer closed with an appreciation<br />\nof the work of Coleridge, and a consideration of the indebtedness of his<br />\nage and of the reading world of all<br />\nages to the great Lake poet.<br />\nThe discussion of the character<br />\nand writings of Keats was equally<br />\nadequate and appreciative. Sir<br />\nWalter first sought to dissipate the<br />\ngeneral, though erroneous, impression that the brilliant, romantic poet<br />\nwas an affected dandy like Leigh<br />\nHunt and many another of his literary contemporaries. He showed that<br />\nKeats was a man of happy disposi-<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins lacrosse team<br />\nplayed the Carlisle Indians to a<br />\n3-to-3 tie on Saturday at Homewood Field in a game lull of excitement and interest from whistle to<br />\nwhistle. The Indians, although<br />\nfighting hard for the victory, seemed<br />\nto play rather listlessly, and it was<br />\nnot until the last few minutes of the<br />\ncontest that real fighting took place.<br />\nHopkins made their first score well<br />\non ill the game, this being followed<br />\nouickly by the Indians' initial tally.<br />\nThe ball was almost constantly in<br />\nthe visitors' territory, and time and<br />\nagain the Black and Blue men shot<br />\nfor goal only to be confronted with<br />\na disappointing-looking crowd of<br />\nredskins blocking the goal. Carlisle<br />\nseemed to be playing an entirely defensive game, barring such times as<br />\nwhen they would momentarily carry<br />\nthe ball down the field and try for<br />\ngoal. It was in times like these that<br />\nthe invaluable services of Stuart, in<br />\nthe goal, and 'Huck and Brooks, his<br />\nhelpers, saved Hopkins from severe<br />\npunishment.<br />\nMany former lacrosse stars present at the game were disappointed<br />\nin the way the Hopkins men allowed<br />\nthe ball to be taken from them without a \"fight,\" but it was suggested<br />\nthat perhaps this was caused by lack<br />\nAltogether, the<br />\nof confidence.<br />\ncoaches were pleased by the showing of the team, and expect to have<br />\na well-seasoned team in condition to<br />\nmeet Navy and Pennsylvania this<br />\nweek.

He had just succeeded in<br />\nworking up a fluffy lather from a<br />\ngiant cake of soap and was about<br />\nto step under the spray when the<br />\nwater ceased to flow. He worked<br />\nawhile at the spigots, but the pipes<br />\nwere empty. Covered with soapsuds, he pondered awhile, then became indignant, and, failing to find<br />\nthe ,English language expressive, began to speak in an old Semitic<br />\ntongue, which was a great revelation, as well as shock, to his hearers.<br />\nA committee of relief offered him<br />\nthe little bit of water which remained in a drinking pail, and applying this with a ladle and by means<br />\nof a stiff piece of cardboard he<br />\nfinally cleaned off the lather, and<br />\nwent without the shower.<br />\nThe caretaker of Homewood<br />\nField said: \"The water tank is<br />\nempty; it will take two hours to fill<br />\nit. You cannot take a bath today.\"<br />\nAn inquiry into the state of affairs revealed the following facts:<br />\nThat, notwithstanding the testimony<br />\nof the caretaker, there was water in<br />\nthe tank, but that it had been turned<br />\noff until the members of another<br />\nteam, which was still at practice,<br />\nhad returned for their showers. So<br />\nthose who had been affected by the<br /><br />\nThe announcement of an anonymous gift of $50,000 to the University came as a delightful surprise last week. It was not definitely announced whether the money<br />\nwould be immediately available nor<br />\nwhether it could be put into that<br />\nslowly-growing fund which will enable the building of the remainder<br />\nof the University's plant on the new<br />\nHomewood estate, but the very fact<br />\nthat a Baltimorean (who does not<br />\nwish his name made public) is so<br />\ninterested in our welfare as to give<br />\nus this sum of money at a time<br />\nwhen so much is needed reminds us<br />\nagain of the fact that Baltimore is<br />\nworking with the University and<br />\nwants to see it soon housed in<br />\nits magnificent new home in the<br />\nsuburbs.<br />\nFifty thousand dollars might not<br />\nmean much to the larger universities with great endowments and<br />\nregular -donors of princely sums.\"<br />\nTo them it would he only a drop in<br />\nthe bucket. But Hopkins, because<br />\nof its youth and consequent small<br />\nbody of alumni, rarely receives a<br />\ngift of money except from some<br />\neducational foundation or under the<br />\nterms of the will of a friend. This<br />\nanonymous $50,000, then, means<br />\nmuch to the University. It brings<br />\na message of friendship and collies<br />\nat a time when the institution, perhaps more than at any other time,<br />\nneeds money. It lightens the hearts<br />\nof the men who are wrapped up in<br />\nthe \"on to Homewood\" movement.<br />\nBecause it expresses the esteem<br />\nin which the University is held by<br />\n\"A Baltimorean,\" it is encouragement ; and, because it is encouragement, it is as greatly appreciated as<br />\nthose great sums which are received<br />\nby other universities and colleges\u2014<br />\nthose large amounts which do not<br />\nmake Hopkins envious, but which<br />\nspur it on to renewed activity with<br />\nthe hope that some day it will be<br />\nin a position to call upon rich alumni<br />\nto satisfy every little wish and whim.<br /><br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br /><br />\nT.<br /><br />\nEx-Governor William<br />\nHaines,<br />\nof Maine, has enrolled in one of the<br />\nshort agricultural courses at the<br />\nUniversity of Maine.<br />\n* * *<br />\nTo organize the Dartmouth undergraduates into an efficient body<br />\nfor fire prevention, a student fire<br />\nsquad has been appointed by Pal2eopitus and President Nichols.
