These four albums -- Prologue, Ashes are<br />\nBurning, Turn of the Cards and Scheherazade \u2014 are great<br />\nindividually, and together form a succession of musical<br />\ndevelonment which is beautiful and exciting to follow. ,<br />\nEach 'album is/ different from the others, but the four<br />\nposess a unity of musical styles and forms which<br />\nchax-acterizes the music of Renaissance.

Edited and with an<br />\nintroduction by Robert A. Martin. 401 pages. Viking.<br />\n$15. Available at the Johns Hopkins Book Center.<br />\nBy MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nArthur Miller can't be accused of inconsistency -. The<br />\ntwenty-three articles and three interviews brought<br />\ntogether in The Theater Essays of Arthur Miller were<br />\nwritten over a period extending from the mid-1940's until<br />\ntile present. What is .most striking about the collection is<br />\nthe consistency of :most Miller's theories on drama and<br />\nsociety.<br />\nIt's all there from the beginning. When interviewed<br />\nafter the premiere of.his second professionally produced<br />\nplay, All My Sons ,(1947), Miller said: \"I don't see how<br />\nyou can write anything decent without using the c,aestion<br />\nof right and Wrong as the basis.\" For Miller,questions of<br />\nmorality have always been set within a social context:'<br />\nSociety is inside man and man is inside society, and you<br />\ncannot even create a truthfully drawn psychological<br />\nentity on the stage until you understand his social<br />\nrelations.\"<br />\nTwo early essays,. \"Tragedy and the Common Man\"<br />\nand \"The Nature of Tragedy,\" though short, lay the<br />\nphilosophic foundations Miller would build upon in his<br />\nmature plays of the 1950's and 60's. The conciseness and<br />\ndirectness' of these essays make several of the later and<br />\nlonger amplifications of their tenets seem tautological.<br />\nThat's the great disadvantage of Miller's consistency. The<br />\nmore recent essays don't really add much to the opinions<br />\nexpressed in these first essays. A reader has good reason<br />\nnot to read the nearly 400 pages of essayson the theater,<br />\nbut there's no excuse for ignoring \"Tragedy and the<br />\nCommon Man\" or \"The Nature of Tragedy.\"<br />\nIn the first essay Miller attacks the traditional<br />\ninterpretations of tragedy in which only kings or nobility<br />\nwere fit subjects for dramatic treatment. Playwrights as<br />\nfar back as Lessing in the 18th century had argued for the<br />\neligibility of common men to be tragic heroes, but even in<br />\npost-Wold War II America many still remained<br />\nunconvinced that plumbers, housewives, even salemen,<br />\n<br />\ncould be used effectively as dramatic material. Miller<br />\ncomes out swinging at archaic notions of tragedy and of<br />\nmodern psychological interpretations of man that deny<br />\nthe power of an individual will.<br />\n\"I believe that the common man is as apt a subject for<br />\ntragedy in its highest sense as kings were....Our lack of<br />\ntragedy may be partially accounted for by the turn whicn<br />\nmodern literature has taken toward the purely psychiatric<br />\nview of life, or the purely sociological. If all our miseries,<br />\nour indignities are born and bred within our minds, then<br />\nall action, let alone the heroic action, is obviously<br />\nimpossible... There is a misconception that tragedy is of<br />\nnecessity allied to pessimism...In truth tragedy implies<br />\nmore optimism in its author than does comedy....The<br />\n.possibility of victory must be there in tragedy....Pathos<br />\ntruly is the mode for tne pessimist. But tragedy requires a<br />\nnicer balance between what is possible and what is<br />\nimpossible.\"<br />\nTragedy whould .imply a certain amount of hope<br />\nabout the human race, a hope for individual human beings<br />\ncoming not from any expression of individual strength<br />\nand independence, but from reliance on the other<br />\nindividuals around us. \"We are trying to save ourselves<br />\nseparately and that is immoral, that is the corrosive<br />\namong us.\" Human involvement with and responsibility<br />\nfor other people, the set of social contracts we establish,<br />\nare the elements of social drama. As such, they help to<br />\nexplain Miller's affinity with other social dramatists,<br />\nIbsen, Shaw, Chekhov and Brecht, all of whom are<br />\nfrequently mentioned in'this book.<br />\nMiller refuses to allow economic, social or psychiatric<br />\ndeterminism effect the outcome of his dramas. A person<br />\nis more than the sum of his or her parts: \"We are made<br />\nand yet are more than what made us.\"\u2022 Humanism<br />\novercomes, or at least is capable of overcoming,<br />\ndeterministic forces. Miller posits humanistic values and<br />\nconsiders tragedy to be when. somebody witho-ut<br />\nthose<br />\nvalues, a man like Willy toman, becomes aware of<br />\nand<br />\nfights to obtain them. If there ,weren't such values<br />\nthere<br />\nwould be pathos and pessimism, not tragedy. Tneir<br />\nexistence implies hope and the tragic struggle to<br />\nachieve<br />\nthem.<br />\n<br />\nTrain for the<br />\nNavy's sky now.<br />\n<br />\nHis introduction to the Collected Plays , anotner<br />\nimportant essay, states the seriousness of his dramatic<br />\nendeavour and the optimism behind it: \"Tne assumpti<br />\non<br />\n-- or presumption -- - behind these plays is that<br />\nlife has<br />\nmeaning...I regard the theater as a serious business, one<br />\nthat makes or should make men more human, which is<br />\nto<br />\nsay, less alone.\"<br />\nThis mixture of seriousness and optimism makes for<br />\ncompelling theatrical experiences. His essays devoted to<br />\nthe theater -- and devotion is the proper word for an art<br />\nform wnicht he considers \"an arena of near-theological<br />\ndevotion\" -- are likewise often of the same compelling<br />\ninterest. That the essays don't always satisfy or extend<br />\nthe philosophic horizon may be attributable in part to<br />\ntheir publication history. Most were written for popular<br />\nmagazines and daily newspapers. Hence, they tend to be<br />\nshort and general in nature, and many say pretty much<br />\nthe same thing. What Miller has to say about theater in<br />\ngeneral and in particular about his own play s is well worth<br />\nlistening to, though maybe not ad in one sitting.<br />\n<br />\nSymphonette<br />\nThe Maryland Symplionette under the direction of<br />\nAngelo Gatto and Minteng Chen, Associate, will perform<br />\na concert of classical music on Sunday, May 14, 3:00 p.m.<br />\nin Shriver Hall at Johns Hopkins University.

John<br />\nSanto got five hits in six trys and<br />\nBruce Kane had 4 for 5. Kane's<br />\nhits included a double and a<br />\ntriple. Dave Lewing was the long<br />\nball hitter with a triple, double,<br />\nand two singles.<br />\nCoach Cox had especially kind<br />\nwords for shortstop Steve<br />\nwho has had the<br />\nGalloway<br />\ndifficult job of filling the shoes<br />\n<br />\nof last year's shortstop, David<br />\nEmala, now playing in the Oriole<br />\nfarm system. Galloway<br />\ncontributed the game's fielding<br />\ngem in the second inning of the<br />\nopener. With men on second and<br />\nthird, one out, and the infield<br />\nplaying in on the grass, Galloway<br />\nmade a diving stop of what<br />\nseemed like a sure base nit up the<br />\nmiddle.

Juniors Dave<br />\nHuntley and Scott Baugher and<br />\nSophomore Wayne Davis all<br />\nadded two each. The Blue Jay<br />\noffense was strong with six goals<br />\nbeing assisted and score being<br />\nevenly divided between the four<br />\nquarters.<br />\nIf this year's Hopkins vs.<br />\nMaryland game is anything like<br />\n<br />\nlast year's, then the Jay ten will<br />\nhave to be ready to go four<br />\nquarters and then some.

Another asset<br />\nto the Maryland team is toeir<br />\nvery successful man-down<br />\ndefense, which all but shut down<br />\nthe Navy's man up offense last<br />\nweek. Rumor has it that the<br />\nHopkins coaching staff has<br />\ndreamed up some dazzlers to<br />\ntake care of that situation.<br />\n<br />\nNetmen Hot Streak<br />\nBy KEVIN GRANVILLE<br />\nHaving won five of their last<br />\nsix matches, the tennis team is<br />\nstreaking toward the end of their<br />\nseason. After bowing to Franklin<br />\nand Marshall on Monday, the<br />\nteam regained its winning ways<br />\nby picking on Dickson for an<br />\n8-.1 rout.<br />\nThe tennis team was tripped<br />\nby a<br />\n- nday<br />\nup on M )<br />\nwell-balanced<br />\nFranklin and<br />\nMarshall team by the score of<br />\n3-6; previous to this match the<br />\nHopkins netmen had won four<br />\nin a row. The F & M team, which<br />\nleads its section of the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference with a 7-1<br />\nrecord, featured a strong player<br />\ntheir line<br />\nin every spot in.,<br />\nup. Hopkins was successful in<br />\njust one of the six singles<br />\nmatches, but gained back some<br />\nground in winning two of the<br />\nthree doubles contests.<br />\nAsked if perhaps the Hopkins<br />\nplayers let up against F & M after<br />\nhaving won four straight, coach<br />\nRay Santamaria didn't hesitate to<br />\nanswer: \"No, there was no let up.<br />\nI have to give credit where credit<br />\nis due, and tnis Franklin and<br />\nMarshall team simply has<br />\nstrength down the line.\"<br />\nRich Nomady, Hopkins'<br />\nnumber two singles player, had a<br />\nparticularly frustrating loss of 6-3<br />\nand 6-4; the loss was due, to a<br />\nlarge extent, to a pulled tendon<br />\nin his right (playing) arm. \"It was<br />\nreally hindering my backhand as<br />\nI was playing. My opponent was<br />\napparently thinking 'This guy has<br />\na good forehand but iris<br />\nbackhand is really poor' and he<br />\ntook advantage of it.\"<br />\nKenny Vogelstein, a native of<br />\nBaltimore who is Hopkins'<br />\n<br />\nnumber one singles player,<br />\nshored Up the Blue Jays' only<br />\nwin in the singles category with a<br />\n6-4, 6-7, 6-1 win over his F & M<br />\nopponent.

However, Coach<br />\nSantamaria will send a number of<br />\nplayers to the MAC Individual<br />\nChampionships, coming up ill<br />\ntwo weeks at Swarthmore.<br />\nThis is Ray Santamaria's<br />\nrookie year as the tennis team<br />\ncoach, and as the season draws to<br />\na close, the players are happy<br />\nwith the job done by this former<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team captain.<br />\nKevin Little, captain of the<br />\ntennis team, commented that<br />\nCoach Santamaria has been doing<br />\n\"a really good job. He's got a<br />\ngood team and he's making the<br />\nmost of it. Besides being a coach,<br />\nhe's been working on our strokes,<br />\nwhich has helped a lot.\" Senior<br />\nRich Nomady added, \"He's been<br />\ngettin us out, working us hard,<br />\nand his instruction has been very<br />\nhelpful.\"<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jays Beat Dickinson<br />\nBy PAUL PENNIMAN<br />\nThe coaches have turned to<br />\npumpkins for Cinderella.<br />\nThe women's lacrosse team,<br />\nfresh off their destruction of<br />\nHood College two weeks ago,<br />\nsuffered a nightmarish three<br />\ngame winless streak last week<br />\nbefore finally defeating<br />\nDickinson this past Wednesday.<br />\nThe team's record stands at<br />\n2-5-1, with two games remaining.<br />\nThis spring had promised<br />\ntangible improvement in the Blue<br />\nJays' performance over last year,<br />\nbut they have not won any close<br />\ngames.

Edited and with an<br />\nintroduction by Robert A. Martin. 401 pages. Viking.<br />\n$15. Available at the Johns Hopkins Book Center.<br />\nBy MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nArthur Miller can't be accused of inconsistency -. The<br />\ntwenty-three articles and three interviews brought<br />\ntogether in The Theater Essays of Arthur Miller were<br />\nwritten over a period extending from the mid-1940's until<br />\ntile present. What is .most striking about the collection is<br />\nthe consistency of :most Miller's theories on drama and<br />\nsociety.<br />\nIt's all there from the beginning. When interviewed<br />\nafter the premiere of.his second professionally produced<br />\nplay, All My Sons ,(1947), Miller said: \"I don't see how<br />\nyou can write anything decent without using the c,aestion<br />\nof right and Wrong as the basis.\" For Miller,questions of<br />\nmorality have always been set within a social context:'<br />\nSociety is inside man and man is inside society, and you<br />\ncannot even create a truthfully drawn psychological<br />\nentity on the stage until you understand his social<br />\nrelations.\"<br />\nTwo early essays,. \"Tragedy and the Common Man\"<br />\nand \"The Nature of Tragedy,\" though short, lay the<br />\nphilosophic foundations Miller would build upon in his<br />\nmature plays of the 1950's and 60's. The conciseness and<br />\ndirectness' of these essays make several of the later and<br />\nlonger amplifications of their tenets seem tautological.<br />\nThat's the great disadvantage of Miller's consistency. The<br />\nmore recent essays don't really add much to the opinions<br />\nexpressed in these first essays. A reader has good reason<br />\nnot to read the nearly 400 pages of essayson the theater,<br />\nbut there's no excuse for ignoring \"Tragedy and the<br />\nCommon Man\" or \"The Nature of Tragedy.\"<br />\nIn the first essay Miller attacks the traditional<br />\ninterpretations of tragedy in which only kings or nobility<br />\nwere fit subjects for dramatic treatment. Playwrights as<br />\nfar back as Lessing in the 18th century had argued for the<br />\neligibility of common men to be tragic heroes, but even in<br />\npost-Wold War II America many still remained<br />\nunconvinced that plumbers, housewives, even salemen,<br /><br />\ncould be used effectively as dramatic material. Miller<br />\ncomes out swinging at archaic notions of tragedy and of<br />\nmodern psychological interpretations of man that deny<br />\nthe power of an individual will.<br />\n\"I believe that the common man is as apt a subject for<br />\ntragedy in its highest sense as kings were....Our lack of<br />\ntragedy may be partially accounted for by the turn whicn<br />\nmodern literature has taken toward the purely psychiatric<br />\nview of life, or the purely sociological. If all our miseries,<br />\nour indignities are born and bred within our minds, then<br />\nall action, let alone the heroic action, is obviously<br />\nimpossible... There is a misconception that tragedy is of<br />\nnecessity allied to pessimism...In truth tragedy implies<br />\nmore optimism in its author than does comedy....The<br />\n.possibility of victory must be there in tragedy....Pathos<br />\ntruly is the mode for tne pessimist. But tragedy requires a<br />\nnicer balance between what is possible and what is<br />\nimpossible.\"<br />\nTragedy whould .imply a certain amount of hope<br />\nabout the human race, a hope for individual human beings<br />\ncoming not from any expression of individual strength<br />\nand independence, but from reliance on the other<br />\nindividuals around us. \"We are trying to save ourselves<br />\nseparately and that is immoral, that is the corrosive<br />\namong us.\" Human involvement with and responsibility<br />\nfor other people, the set of social contracts we establish,<br />\nare the elements of social drama. As such, they help to<br />\nexplain Miller's affinity with other social dramatists,<br />\nIbsen, Shaw, Chekhov and Brecht, all of whom are<br />\nfrequently mentioned in'this book.<br />\nMiller refuses to allow economic, social or psychiatric<br />\ndeterminism effect the outcome of his dramas. A person<br />\nis more than the sum of his or her parts: \"We are made<br />\nand yet are more than what made us.\"\u2022 Humanism<br />\novercomes, or at least is capable of overcoming,<br />\ndeterministic forces. Miller posits humanistic values and<br />\nconsiders tragedy to be when. somebody witho-ut<br />\nthose<br />\nvalues, a man like Willy toman, becomes aware of<br />\nand<br />\nfights to obtain them. If there ,weren't such values<br />\nthere<br />\nwould be pathos and pessimism, not tragedy. Tneir<br />\nexistence implies hope and the tragic struggle to<br />\nachieve<br />\nthem.<br /><br />\nTrain for the<br />\nNavy's sky now.<br /><br />\nHis introduction to the Collected Plays , anotner<br />\nimportant essay, states the seriousness of his dramatic<br />\nendeavour and the optimism behind it: \"Tne assumpti<br />\non<br />\n-- or presumption -- - behind these plays is that<br />\nlife has<br />\nmeaning...I regard the theater as a serious business, one<br />\nthat makes or should make men more human, which is<br />\nto<br />\nsay, less alone.\"<br />\nThis mixture of seriousness and optimism makes for<br />\ncompelling theatrical experiences. His essays devoted to<br />\nthe theater -- and devotion is the proper word for an art<br />\nform wnicht he considers \"an arena of near-theological<br />\ndevotion\" -- are likewise often of the same compelling<br />\ninterest. That the essays don't always satisfy or extend<br />\nthe philosophic horizon may be attributable in part to<br />\ntheir publication history. Most were written for popular<br />\nmagazines and daily newspapers. Hence, they tend to be<br />\nshort and general in nature, and many say pretty much<br />\nthe same thing. What Miller has to say about theater in<br />\ngeneral and in particular about his own play s is well worth<br />\nlistening to, though maybe not ad in one sitting.<br /><br />\nSymphonette<br />\nThe Maryland Symplionette under the direction of<br />\nAngelo Gatto and Minteng Chen, Associate, will perform<br />\na concert of classical music on Sunday, May 14, 3:00 p.m.<br />\nin Shriver Hall at Johns Hopkins University.

So accordingly we have devised that most<br />\nchallenging of contests -- The Treasure Hunt. Last night,<br />\nunder cover of darkness, an object which shall be known<br />\nonly as \"The Real Thing\" was placed in a forgotten<br />\ncranny somewhere on campus. You'll know \"The Real<br />\nThing\" when you find it because it looks out of place<br />\nwhere it is now, and also bears a note telling you that it<br />\nis indeed \"The Real Thing.\" The Treasure Scroll<br />\ncontains all the information You need to track down<br />\nyour obj,:ctive, provided you have a knack for puns and<br />\na little imag nation. The first person or persons to burst<br />\nthrough the door of the Gatehouse with \"The Real<br />\nThing\" in their hot little hands receive(s) TWO CASES<br />\nof MICHELOB, courtesy of Eddies. This is the last<br />\ncontest of the year. So \"Good Luck\" from the wry<br />\nquizmasters, the Blue Ribbon Panel, and of course from<br />\nBunkie.<br /><br />\nDirections<br /><br />\n----Daily News<br /><br />\nLast Week's Results \u2014 Page 2<br /><br />\nWalk between the gaslamps and go through two<br />\nbuildings to the road.<br /><br />\nFind out who died in 1950.
