It seemed to be the<br />\nOpinion of many members at the<br />\nmeeting that the criminal is responsible neither mentally nor morally;<br />\nthis point was brought out by sev,eral speakers.<br />\nAmong the persons who made<br />\naddresses were: Mrs. Maud Ballington Booth; John D. Lawson,<br />\nDean of the Law School of the<br />\nUniversity of Missouri; Dr. H. H.<br />\nHart, Director of the Child-helping<br />\nDepartment of the Russell Sage<br />\nFoundation.<br />\nElection of officers for the comMr.<br />\ning year (1913) was held.<br />\nJames A. Leonard was elected<br />\npresident to succeed Mr. Fred G.<br />\nPettigrove of Boston. Mr. Leonard<br />\nhas been for many years the warden<br />\nof the Ohio State Reformatory at<br />\nMansfield, 0.<br />\nDr. D. C. Peyton of Jeffersonville, Ind., was elected vice-president and Mr. Joseph P. Byers was<br />\nelected secretary.<br />\n<br />\nParker, Thomas & Rice, the architects of the Gilman Building, which<br />\nwill be the first of the new Homewood quadrangle to be erected, have<br />\nnot yet finished specifications and<br />\nbuilding plans.<br />\nAs soon as these papers are ready<br />\nthe Board of Trustees will let the<br />\ncontracts and the actual building<br />\nwill . begin. It was stated in an.<br />\narticle last week that the Gilman<br />\nBuilding was not to contain the<br />\nUniversity library. Ultimately, the<br />\nlibrary will be in this building, but<br />\nthe rooms will have to first be used<br />\nas lecture rooms until the other<br />\nbuildings are erected. Then when<br />\nthe \"quad\" is finished the library<br />\nwill be moved into the Gilman<br />\nBuilding.<br />\nIt is understood that after the<br />\ncontracts for this building are let the<br />\nTrustees will examine plans for the<br />\nfour scientific laboratories and the<br />\ntechnical buildings. Drawings for<br />\nthese are ready, and the Board will<br />\nhold a special meeting to consider<br />\nthem in the near future. The Gilman Building will be the western<br />\nend of the \"quad\" and two laboratories on a side will form the north<br />\nand south sides. The eastern end<br />\nwill not be closed until later.<br />\nExtending southwards from the<br />\nlaboratories will be the technical<br />\nbuildings in the form of another<br />\nquadrangle.<br />\nThe contour of the Homewood<br />\nEstate will be preserved as much as<br />\npossible in the erection of the buildings. The tract is one of the prettiest natural parks about Baltimore,<br />\nand many of the trustees favored the<br />\nplan of erecting the buildings to<br />\nconform to the ground.<br />\nFew of the old trees on the estate<br />\nwill be cut down, and the \"quad<br />\nwill have surrounding it trees larger<br />\nthan the Old Elms at Yale.<br />\n<br />\nToo much cannot be said in praise<br />\nof the great amount of college<br />\nspirit manifested by Hopkins, both<br />\nin the parade and at Homewood,<br />\nlast Saturday. The better part of<br />\nthe undergraduate student body,<br />\nwith the exception of the players<br />\nand others who were acting in official positions, responded nobly to<br />\nthe appeals that were made at the<br />\nmass-meetings during the week.<br />\nThat a great awakening had<br />\ntaken place at Hopkins was evident<br />\nto all, and particularly to the regular spectators at Homewood. They<br />\ncontrasted the spirit shown last<br />\nSaturday with that at the preceding games at Homewood, and were<br />\nvery much pleased with the difference.<br />\nA culmination of the spirit which<br />\nbegan to develop at Tuesday's<br />\nmass-meeting was reached on Saturday. The singing of songs during the intervals between classes<br />\nhad much to do with stirring up the<br />\nenthusiasm displayed by Hopkins.<br />\nThe mass-meeting at Homewood<br />\nFriday afternoon was better attended than any for many years.<br />\nThose who assembled at Homewood on Friday sat for more than<br />\na half hour in the cold grandstand<br />\nafter dark, cheering the 'Varsity<br />\neleven as it ran through its final<br />\nsignal drill.<br />\nEmrich's band was a decided success, and Manager Ellis Ellicott and<br />\n\"Gus\" Sattler should be congratulated on their choice. The parade<br />\nbegan assembling between twelve<br />\nand one o'clock, and although it<br />\ndid not start until after half past<br />\none, everyone joined in the intermittent yells and songs which were<br />\ngiven every few moments.<br />\nWhen the parade did start it was<br />\nat once apparent that it was the<br />\nbest that has been held for several<br />\nyears. New features were introduced, especially by the sophomore<br />\nclass, a number of whose members<br />\nformed a kettle drum division, each<br />\nbeing equipped with large tin dishes<br />\nand wooden spoons, which were<br />\nused as drumsticks.<br />\n' The sophomores also had secured<br />\na very vociferously blatant, cacoplionious goat, which was the principal feature of the whole parade.<br />\nHeaded by Emr,ich's band the paraders started following in the<br />\norder of classes, although many<br />\nalumni were interspersed at various<br />\npoints. Edward Novak was the<br />\nstandard bearer of the seniors, and<br />\nthey followed immediately behind<br />\n<br />\nfter being defeated three years<br />\nin succession by Hopkins' teams, St.<br />\nJohn's College, the 'Varsity's oldest<br />\nand bitterest rival got vendrtta last<br />\nSaturday at Homewood, 27 to 7.<br />\nForward passes won the game<br />\nfor the cadets, and their work in<br />\nthis department has not been<br />\nequalled on the Homewood Field,<br />\nexcept, perhaps, by Twig-g of_Western Maryland, whose long thrOWs<br />\nlast season were spectacular and<br />\nwon the game then. To Wilson,<br />\nthe St. John's left halfback, who<br />\nthrew the passes Saturday, belongs<br />\nthe credit for the victory.<br />\nThe throws were not for long<br />\ndistances; they were not spectacular because of the distance they<br />\nmade, but the were accurate, lefthanded, timely and sped like a baseball. The four winning touchdowns<br />\nhad for their direct source a beautiful forward pass. Three times Mellon carried the ball over after receiving from Wilson, and Claude<br />\ncarried the fourth.<br />\nHopkins did not use the forward<br />\npass successfully, however, but in<br />\nall other respects played on a par<br />\nwith the Annapolis players. Hopkins frequently had the ball in St.<br />\nJohn's territory near the goal, but<br />\nthe cadets' barrier was impenetrable;<br />\nend runs and line plays could not<br />\ngain ground, and the 'Varsity was<br />\nforced to give up the ball.<br />\nIn a like manner, St. John's<br />\nworked the ball upfield to within the<br />\nshadow of the Hopkins goal. The<br />\n'Varsity line held, and St. John's<br />\ncould not gain on an end run. It<br />\nwas at these crises that a forward<br />\npass was called and a touchdown<br />\nmade. Once in each period the<br />\nAnnapolis team scored. Hopkins<br />\nmade its touchdown in the last<br />\nquarter.<br />\nLine plays, with Branham and<br />\nG. Penniman carrying the ball,<br />\nbrought Hopkins up to within 12<br />\nyards of the St. John's goal. Tappan tried a forward pass, which<br />\nMellon intercepted, and a groan<br />\nwent up from Hopkins rooters.<br />\nClayton received the ball to punt<br />\nout, but the Hopkins line broke<br />\nthrough, and a trio of linemen<br />\nblocked the kick. The ball went<br />\nover the goal line and in a minute<br />\nFrankie La Motte had it tucked<br />\nunder his arm, saving the 'Varsity<br />\nfrom the ignominy of a whitewash.<br />\nNewspaper reports said that Liebensperger and Bridgman blocked<br />\nthe kick. It was a hard play to see,<br />\nbut the general opinion is that both<br />\n<br />\n(Continued oh page 8, col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\nFederated Charities.<br />\n<br />\nOn Tuesday, November 26, at 8<br />\nP.

The general theme of the<br />\nmeeting will be \"The Volunteer and<br />\nHis Work.\" The speakers will be<br />\nDr. Richard C. Cabot and Mrs.<br />\nJohn M. Glenn. The latter is well<br />\nknown for her writings and social<br />\nactivities. Dr. Cabot is the distinguished superintendent 'of the Massachusetts General Hospital, and<br />\nthe founder of the Hospital Social<br />\nService Department. He is also the<br />\nauthor of books and articles on social service as related to the medical<br />\nprofession. The public is invited to<br />\nattend the meeting.<br />\n<br />\nMusical Clubs.<br />\n<br />\nThe Glee Club held its first rehearsal last Wednesday week at<br />\no'clock. The attendance was very<br />\ngood for the first meeting, and the<br />\nofficers are in hopes that it will continue. Several of the Hopkins<br />\nsongs were practiced and the result<br />\nwas pronounced 0. K. The coming season promises to be a very<br />\nsuccessful one for the Musical<br />\nClubs, and new men are urged not<br />\nto neglect an opportunity to become<br />\nmembers.

No effort was<br />\nmade by either Mr. Dickinson or<br />\nmyself to secure signatures.<br />\nI regard the fact, that practically<br />\nevery non-fraternity member of the<br />\nsenior class signed the petition at<br />\nonce, as conclusive proof that the<br />\nnon-fraternity men were heartily<br />\nin favor of a just non-fraternity<br />\nrepresentation upon the Cotillon<br />\nBoard. I feel confident that if I<br />\nhad made any effort to place the<br />\nmatter before the non-fraternity<br />\nmen I could have enlisted the<br />\nhearty support and secured the<br />\nsignatures of more than 90 per<br />\ncent, of the non-fraternity men. I<br />\nmade no effort to do this as I<br />\nhoped the petition would not have<br />\nto be used, and I thought the less<br />\nfeeling aroused over the matter the<br />\nbetter. The subsequent course of<br />\naction of the Cotillon Board showed<br />\nthat I had exactly anticipated the<br />\nsituation. For the sake of harmony,<br />\nand as a compromise, the Student<br />\nCouncil conceded and conceded. It<br />\nfinally went so far as to offer to<br />\ncompromise on one non-fraternity<br />\nrepresentative outright, and a second if twenty-five non-fraternity<br />\nsubscriptions were secured. Even<br />\nthis was turned down by the Cotillon Board, and the Student Council, although composed of a majority of fraternity men, felt that<br />\nit could yield no further, and broke<br />\noff negotiations. Mr. Dickinson<br />\nand I then, much against our will,<br />\npresented our petition to the Cotillon Board. This created another<br />\nstorm of contention and one which<br />\nseems only to have begun.<br />\nIn order to try to nullify the petition, personal attacks and misrepresentations have been resorted to.<br />\nCertain things have been said about<br />\nme personally in order to try to<br />\narouse the discontent of some of<br />\nthe signers of the petition. I unhesitatingly brand these ad hominem arguments as malicious falsehoods and am willing at any time<br />\nto meet the authors of the false<br />\nstatements and explain anything to<br />\nthe satisfaction of all fair minded<br />\npersons.<br />\nI drew up the petition solely because I felt it was necessary as a<br />\nmeans of securing for the non-fraternity men what justly belongs ,tID<br />\nthem. I have not taken up the matter for any personal object, and in<br />\nspite of all reports to the contrary,<br />\nI will not under any circumstances<br />\naccept a position as a non-fraternity representative on the Cotillon<br />\nBoard. As a member of the Student Council, I am ready at all<br />\ntimes to represent all classes of<br />\nstudents, and I am ready to champion any fraternity cause in the<br />\nsame way I have in this case Championed a non-fraternity cause, provided I can be convinced that it is<br />\nequally just.<br />\n<br />\nCHARLES LELAND GETZ.<br />\n<br />\nCIGARS, SODA<br />\nAND CANDY<br />\n<br />\nHIRSHBERG ART CO.<br />\n<br />\nImporters, Jobbers and Retailers of<br />\n<br />\n418 N.

It seemed to be the<br />\nOpinion of many members at the<br />\nmeeting that the criminal is responsible neither mentally nor morally;<br />\nthis point was brought out by sev,eral speakers.<br />\nAmong the persons who made<br />\naddresses were: Mrs. Maud Ballington Booth; John D.

It was stated in an.<br />\narticle last week that the Gilman<br />\nBuilding was not to contain the<br />\nUniversity library. Ultimately, the<br />\nlibrary will be in this building, but<br />\nthe rooms will have to first be used<br />\nas lecture rooms until the other<br />\nbuildings are erected. Then when<br />\nthe \"quad\" is finished the library<br />\nwill be moved into the Gilman<br />\nBuilding.<br />\nIt is understood that after the<br />\ncontracts for this building are let the<br />\nTrustees will examine plans for the<br />\nfour scientific laboratories and the<br />\ntechnical buildings. Drawings for<br />\nthese are ready, and the Board will<br />\nhold a special meeting to consider<br />\nthem in the near future. The Gilman Building will be the western<br />\nend of the \"quad\" and two laboratories on a side will form the north<br />\nand south sides. The eastern end<br />\nwill not be closed until later.<br />\nExtending southwards from the<br />\nlaboratories will be the technical<br />\nbuildings in the form of another<br />\nquadrangle.<br />\nThe contour of the Homewood<br />\nEstate will be preserved as much as<br />\npossible in the erection of the buildings. The tract is one of the prettiest natural parks about Baltimore,<br />\nand many of the trustees favored the<br />\nplan of erecting the buildings to<br />\nconform to the ground.<br />\nFew of the old trees on the estate<br />\nwill be cut down, and the \"quad<br />\nwill have surrounding it trees larger<br />\nthan the Old Elms at Yale.<br /><br />\nToo much cannot be said in praise<br />\nof the great amount of college<br />\nspirit manifested by Hopkins, both<br />\nin the parade and at Homewood,<br />\nlast Saturday. The better part of<br />\nthe undergraduate student body,<br />\nwith the exception of the players<br />\nand others who were acting in official positions, responded nobly to<br />\nthe appeals that were made at the<br />\nmass-meetings during the week.<br />\nThat a great awakening had<br />\ntaken place at Hopkins was evident<br />\nto all, and particularly to the regular spectators at Homewood. They<br />\ncontrasted the spirit shown last<br />\nSaturday with that at the preceding games at Homewood, and were<br />\nvery much pleased with the difference.<br />\nA culmination of the spirit which<br />\nbegan to develop at Tuesday's<br />\nmass-meeting was reached on Saturday. The singing of songs during the intervals between classes<br />\nhad much to do with stirring up the<br />\nenthusiasm displayed by Hopkins.<br />\nThe mass-meeting at Homewood<br />\nFriday afternoon was better attended than any for many years.<br />\nThose who assembled at Homewood on Friday sat for more than<br />\na half hour in the cold grandstand<br />\nafter dark, cheering the 'Varsity<br />\neleven as it ran through its final<br />\nsignal drill.<br />\nEmrich's band was a decided success, and Manager Ellis Ellicott and<br />\n\"Gus\" Sattler should be congratulated on their choice. The parade<br />\nbegan assembling between twelve<br />\nand one o'clock, and although it<br />\ndid not start until after half past<br />\none, everyone joined in the intermittent yells and songs which were<br />\ngiven every few moments.<br />\nWhen the parade did start it was<br />\nat once apparent that it was the<br />\nbest that has been held for several<br />\nyears. New features were introduced, especially by the sophomore<br />\nclass, a number of whose members<br />\nformed a kettle drum division, each<br />\nbeing equipped with large tin dishes<br />\nand wooden spoons, which were<br />\nused as drumsticks.<br />\n' The sophomores also had secured<br />\na very vociferously blatant, cacoplionious goat, which was the principal feature of the whole parade.<br />\nHeaded by Emr,ich's band the paraders started following in the<br />\norder of classes, although many<br />\nalumni were interspersed at various<br />\npoints. Edward Novak was the<br />\nstandard bearer of the seniors, and<br />\nthey followed immediately behind<br /><br />\nfter being defeated three years<br />\nin succession by Hopkins' teams, St.<br />\nJohn's College, the 'Varsity's oldest<br />\nand bitterest rival got vendrtta last<br />\nSaturday at Homewood, 27 to 7.<br />\nForward passes won the game<br />\nfor the cadets, and their work in<br />\nthis department has not been<br />\nequalled on the Homewood Field,<br />\nexcept, perhaps, by Twig-g of_Western Maryland, whose long thrOWs<br />\nlast season were spectacular and<br />\nwon the game then. To Wilson,<br />\nthe St. John's left halfback, who<br />\nthrew the passes Saturday, belongs<br />\nthe credit for the victory.<br />\nThe throws were not for long<br />\ndistances; they were not spectacular because of the distance they<br />\nmade, but the were accurate, lefthanded, timely and sped like a baseball. The four winning touchdowns<br />\nhad for their direct source a beautiful forward pass. Three times Mellon carried the ball over after receiving from Wilson, and Claude<br />\ncarried the fourth.<br />\nHopkins did not use the forward<br />\npass successfully, however, but in<br />\nall other respects played on a par<br />\nwith the Annapolis players. Hopkins frequently had the ball in St.<br />\nJohn's territory near the goal, but<br />\nthe cadets' barrier was impenetrable;<br />\nend runs and line plays could not<br />\ngain ground, and the 'Varsity was<br />\nforced to give up the ball.<br />\nIn a like manner, St. John's<br />\nworked the ball upfield to within the<br />\nshadow of the Hopkins goal. The<br />\n'Varsity line held, and St. John's<br />\ncould not gain on an end run. It<br />\nwas at these crises that a forward<br />\npass was called and a touchdown<br />\nmade. Once in each period the<br />\nAnnapolis team scored. Hopkins<br />\nmade its touchdown in the last<br />\nquarter.<br />\nLine plays, with Branham and<br />\nG. Penniman carrying the ball,<br />\nbrought Hopkins up to within 12<br />\nyards of the St. John's goal. Tappan tried a forward pass, which<br />\nMellon intercepted, and a groan<br />\nwent up from Hopkins rooters.<br />\nClayton received the ball to punt<br />\nout, but the Hopkins line broke<br />\nthrough, and a trio of linemen<br />\nblocked the kick. The ball went<br />\nover the goal line and in a minute<br />\nFrankie La Motte had it tucked<br />\nunder his arm, saving the 'Varsity<br />\nfrom the ignominy of a whitewash.<br />\nNewspaper reports said that Liebensperger and Bridgman blocked<br />\nthe kick. It was a hard play to see,<br />\nbut the general opinion is that both<br /><br />\n(Continued oh page 8, col. 2.)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2.)<br /><br />\nFederated Charities.<br /><br />\nOn Tuesday, November 26, at 8<br />\nP.

The attendance was very<br />\ngood for the first meeting, and the<br />\nofficers are in hopes that it will continue. Several of the Hopkins<br />\nsongs were practiced and the result<br />\nwas pronounced 0. K.

The strong teams of the<br />\nMaryland Agricultural College and<br />\nFranklin and Marshall, which defeated Hopkins by heavy scores,<br />\nhad both been whitewashed by St.<br />\nfour-'<br />\nJohn's.

No effort was<br />\nmade by either Mr. Dickinson or<br />\nmyself to secure signatures.<br />\nI regard the fact, that practically<br />\nevery non-fraternity member of the<br />\nsenior class signed the petition at<br />\nonce, as conclusive proof that the<br />\nnon-fraternity men were heartily<br />\nin favor of a just non-fraternity<br />\nrepresentation upon the Cotillon<br />\nBoard. I feel confident that if I<br />\nhad made any effort to place the<br />\nmatter before the non-fraternity<br />\nmen I could have enlisted the<br />\nhearty support and secured the<br />\nsignatures of more than 90 per<br />\ncent, of the non-fraternity men. I<br />\nmade no effort to do this as I<br />\nhoped the petition would not have<br />\nto be used, and I thought the less<br />\nfeeling aroused over the matter the<br />\nbetter. The subsequent course of<br />\naction of the Cotillon Board showed<br />\nthat I had exactly anticipated the<br />\nsituation. For the sake of harmony,<br />\nand as a compromise, the Student<br />\nCouncil conceded and conceded. It<br />\nfinally went so far as to offer to<br />\ncompromise on one non-fraternity<br />\nrepresentative outright, and a second if twenty-five non-fraternity<br />\nsubscriptions were secured. Even<br />\nthis was turned down by the Cotillon Board, and the Student Council, although composed of a majority of fraternity men, felt that<br />\nit could yield no further, and broke<br />\noff negotiations. Mr. Dickinson<br />\nand I then, much against our will,<br />\npresented our petition to the Cotillon Board. This created another<br />\nstorm of contention and one which<br />\nseems only to have begun.<br />\nIn order to try to nullify the petition, personal attacks and misrepresentations have been resorted to.<br />\nCertain things have been said about<br />\nme personally in order to try to<br />\narouse the discontent of some of<br />\nthe signers of the petition.
