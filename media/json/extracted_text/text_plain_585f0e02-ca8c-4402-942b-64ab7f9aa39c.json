The purpose of<br />\nthese discussions is to attempt to persuade those<br />\n<br />\nprofessors to cancel their classes. If that is not possible<br />\nthey will be asked to discuss in class why they will not<br />\nparticipate in the Moratorium. Instructors who do<br />\nintend to hold their classes will be asked to direct the<br />\ntopic for the day of the Moratorium to the relation of<br />\ntheir subject to the war in Vietnam.<br />\nExtensive canvassing of the student body will also be<br />\nsuggested to the SC. Speaking at Fraternity houses, door .<br />\nto door coverage of the dormitories, and discussing the<br />\nMoratorium in the dormitory snack bar and Levering<br />\nHall are possible ways in which the committee felt the<br />\ncampus could be throughly covered.<br />\nOn the day of the Moratorium, SC members will be<br />\nasked to stand outside of classes that are being held and<br />\nmake a last minute appeal to students attending those<br />\nclasses to reconsider and to join those who are<br />\nboycotting regular activities on that day.<br />\n<br />\nThe SC resolution, sponsored by Manuel Rodriguez,<br />\nexpressed \"regret that the President of The Johns<br />\nHopkins University has failed to go along in the spirit of<br />\nthe strong support of several universitites, Senators and<br />\nRepresentatives of the Congress of the United States and<br />\nmany members of the Johns Hopkins faculty and Johns<br />\nHopkins community.\"<br />\nSocietal Glory<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nIn his address to the ACE Dr. Gordon saki that<br />\n\"politiczation\" of American universities can only<br />\ndestroy them as free intellectual institutions. \"It is one<br />\nof the glories of a liberal society that the university can<br />\nat the same time be a part of it, serving some of its most<br />\nimportant functions, and yet be apart from it, sheltering<br />\nand fostering active analysis and criticism of its structure<br />\nand its public policies.\"<br />\n<br />\nSW.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 \u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022\u2022... \u2022,,<br />\n1..:\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nA copy of the S.C. resolution was sent to the<br />\nPresident on Tuesday, but little hope among council<br />\nmembers for any possible alteration of the Pre ident's<br />\nposition.<br />\nThe resolution, which passed without opposition,<br />\nreasserted the SC's support for the Viet Nam<br />\nMoratorium and urged \"all members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity to observe October 15 as a day of protest<br />\nagainst the war in Viet Nam.\"<br />\nChuck Fax, in an effort to increase the council's<br />\nparticipation in the Moratorium, proposed that a<br />\ncommittee be appointed to study me:.ns by which the<br />\nSC'could involve itself on October 15.

After some discussion with Councilman<br />\nParks, a decision was made to draft the resolution.\"We<br />\nbelieve in maintaining an adequate defense force,\" said<br />\nStarks, \"but not in an omniscient Defense Department.\"<br />\nThe sponsors decried the \"tragic involvement\" in<br />\nVietnam that wastes millions of dollars better spent in<br />\nthe cities on education, health, housing, sanitation and a<br />\nmyriad other pressing needs.

The<br />\nviolence that lurks below the city is ugly<br />\nand vicious, and needs the smallest thing<br />\nto trigger itself off.\"<br />\nSpeaking before the AWARE group last<br />\nTuesday night, Parren Mitchell, Professor of<br />\nSociology at Morgan State College, gave a<br />\npessimistic articulation of the dismal<br />\npolitico-socio-economico-and-just-abouteverything-else situation of the Baltimore black<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nMitchell is highly qualified in his<br />\noutspokeness. He has served as Assistant Director<br />\nof the Urban Studies Institute at Morgan State<br />\nand as executive director of the Urban Coalition.<br />\nLast year he ran and lost in a bid for the<br />\nBaltimore 7th District's Congressional seat to<br />\nCongressman Fridell, but remains und: unted and<br />\nplans to run again \"and win this time.\" His<br />\nwarm, outgoing personality seemed to contrast<br />\nwith the grim facts he presented on being black<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\nTen Neanderathals<br />\nCommenting on the City Council, Prof.<br />\nMitchell characterized it as a group of \"ten<br />\nNeanderathals who have the capacity to stifle<br />\nevery piece of liberal legislation that would aid<br />\nblacks\".<br />\nOn discrimination: 'The chance of a Negro<br />\nbuying a house in Baltimore County is nil. The<br />\nSiegfried Line surrounding Baltimore, that is, the<br />\nBeltweay, forms an impregnable barrier beyond<br />\nWhich no black person can live.\"<br />\nAnderson (Executive of Baltimore County)<br />\nwants Baltimore County to be the fastest<br />\ngrowing bastion of descrimination in the<br />\ncountry\".<br />\nBlood-Suckers<br />\nWithin the city, Mitchell said, \"Blacks are<br />\nbeing drained of their life-blood by landlords<br />\nwho suck all the money they can off these<br />\npeople and then flee\". \"The new high-rise<br />\napartments that are being built will only become<br />\ninstant slums.\"<br />\nAnother of his targets is the \"peculiar type of<br />\ngerrymandering used in mapping out political<br />\ndistricts.\" \"The districting of Baltimore is set up<br />\nso as to allow a white man to be elected to a<br />\n<br />\nCongressional seat in a largely black<br />\ncommunity\".<br />\nProfessor Mitchell continually stressed the<br />\nfact he is very pessimistic concerning any change<br />\nin the status quo, but said \"that if I had the<br />\npower, I would recommend the following<br />\nchanges:<br />\nDo-Nothing Coungress<br />\n\"First I would recommend a complete<br />\nredistricting of Congressional and Council voting<br />\ndistricts in order to prevent the election of<br />\ndo-nothing Congressmen who are advocates of<br />\nvested interests.<br />\n\"I also want changes in the civil service.

Let us<br />\ntrace the logical lines along which the problem is currently being attacked.<br />\nAs everyone knows, Hopkins wants black students to come to the<br />\nuniversity. But as the admissions office will tell you, very few blacks meet<br />\nHopkins educational criteria. The inner city schools are simply not on a<br />\npar with the suburban schools and most inner city students do not receive<br />\nthe training which is required for entrance into Hopkins.<br />\nSuggestions have been made advocating that Hopkins relax its<br />\nadmissions criteria in special cases. But these are met with horror from<br />\nevery quarter. As Dr. Stanley will tell you, it would b psychologically<br />\ndisastrous for students to come and then find that they are not able to<br />\ncompete.<br />\nPeople have proposed that the university offer special courses to<br />\ncorrect the educational disadvantages under which black students find<br />\nthemselves (remedial reading, elementary level mathematics, etc.). But this<br />\nis regarded as virtual heresy. Phrases like \"maintaining high standards of<br />\nacademic excellence\" have an almost religious importance for<br />\nadministrators. And no one would dare to drag the name of Hopkins<br />\nthrough the dust by offerring a math course simpler than calculus. \"It is<br />\nnot our responsibility to correct the deficiencies of the secondary<br />\nschools\", they conclude.<br />\nBy now it is evident that Hopkins is not going to receive applications<br />\nfrom many black students. But as you can see, the university has certainly<br />\ntried. Everyone knows that Hopkins wants black students.<br />\nIs it more damaging for students to find that they cannot compete<br />\nonce they arrive at Hopkins, than to find that they will not be given the<br />\nOpportunity to compete at all? Is Hopkins' reputation more grievously<br />\nstained by offerring lower level courses than by excluding virtually the<br />\nentire black population? And does the responsibility for breaking the<br />\nvicious circle of educational discrepancy in this country fall to politicians<br />\nand other non-educators rather than to the universities? We think not.<br />\nWe believe that the proposal to establish a special tutoring program<br />\nemploying the assistance of graduate students is a good one. That idea,<br />\nproposed by Bob Cotter last spring, is lost somewhere in the bowels of<br />\nHomewood House. It it is revised and properly administered, it could<br />\neliminate the meandering logic described above. It is certainly worth the<br />\neffort.

The sign of<br />\nsuccess? Maybe. But if the essence of rock culture has<br />\nbeen successful other than in a commerical sense, the<br />\nresults are far from obvious.<br />\nTwo recent studies which have emerged from the<br />\npens of rock analysts present us with the poles of<br />\ncurrent rock criticism. On the one hand is Arnold<br />\nShaw's The Rock Revolution: What's Happening in<br />\nToday's Music(MacMillan Co., New York, 1969). At the<br />\nother extreme is Nik Cohn and From the Beginning<br />\n(Stein and Day, New York, 1969).<br />\nThey say that you can't judge a book by its cover,<br />\nbut another adage says that there is an exception to<br />\nevery rule. The jackets of these two books tell pretty<br />\nmuch the story of what is inside. The cover of the Shaw<br />\nbook is a plain bluegreen and strongly symbolic: the<br />\nfigure of '69 had rock supported on the shoulders of a<br />\nvast assortment of characters from out of rock 'n roll's<br />\npast. Cohn's book is decorated with a montage of<br />\noranges, greens, blues, and yellows. It is flashy,<br />\nflamboyant, and expects to be considered hip.<br />\nInside is not much different. Nik Cohn is 23, a<br />\nself-styled hippie, and considers himself a \"goof friend\"<br />\nof many rock figures. Okay. Great. But can he write? He<br />\nasserts that his book includes THE sounds, THE groups,<br />\nTHE people, THE technicians, THE managers, etc. of<br />\nthe world of rock. It's all here, baby, between these two<br />\nlittle covers. A frequent contributor to Eve and Cheetah,<br />\nCohn claims to tell us how rock feels, from the point of<br />\nview of a \"lover\" not an \"authority.\" He tries to<br />\n<br />\nconduct a premature autopsy of the living organism that<br />\nis rock. What actually happens is that he kills the beast.<br />\nThe author gets lost in a muddle of anecdotes and smart<br />\nstories which make rock musicians out as something<br />\nabove the ordinary human being and real<br />\nup-with-the-shirtsleeves workers for the revoltuion.<br />\nActually, Cohn and Shaw should have traded titles.<br />\nFrom the Beginning is a much better title for the latter's<br />\nwork than The Rock Revolution: What's Happening in<br />\nToday's Music. Unlike Cohn, Shaw is just this side of 30<br />\nand a lecturer in music at Dickinson College and The<br />\nJulliard Conservatory. He develops a good professor's<br />\nsurvey course in the history of rock 'n roll and its social<br />\nand cultural manifestation \u2014 a saga of rock \"from the<br />\nbeginning.\" With the archetypal academic approach,<br />\nShaw neatly classifies everyone into a particular<br />\nmainstream of musical topoi and thought; and all are<br />\nbrought together in a terse aesthetic, psychological,<br />\nsocial appreciation of the rock phenomenon. He relates<br />\nthe influence of rock to the Civil Rights Movement, the<br />\n\"youth rebellion,\" and the theater, motion pictures, and<br />\nreligion. Everything fits into the taxonomy of the<br />\nhistory of ideas.<br />\nThese two authors have widely divergent approaches<br />\nto the subject \u2014 Rock \u2014 yet both leave the reader<br />\nfeeling somewhat let down by the whole affair. In the<br />\nend, the pictures which accompany both the texts are<br />\nthe best features of the books. 0! Those pictures of<br />\nElvis!<br />\nWhat perhaps comes closest to understanding the<br />\nstructure of rock music is a collection of essays compiled<br />\nby Jonathan Eisen and entitled Sounds of the American<br />\n<br />\nCultural Revolution (Random House, New York, 1969).<br />\nMany of the essays center on specific rock personalities,<br />\nbut it is truly interesting to compare an article on Bob<br />\nDylan written in 1964 and one written in 1068. Some of<br />\nthe essays deal with rock in perhaps, its most<br />\nrevolutionary sense - as a prodding for the conventional<br />\ntheater, music, and art, something neither Cohn or Shaw<br />\ntouched on specifically. Robert Cristgau's article \"Rock<br />\nLyrics are Poetry (Maybe)\" is one of the most<br />\nthoughtful in the collection. The author is perceptive<br />\nand has a good command of his material. He is not guilty<br />\nof hero worship nor is he overly cynical or<br />\ncondescending. Cristgau is perceptive and he manages to<br />\nbring some order in his analysis to a situation which has<br />\nrecently become extremely chaotic \u2014 the question of<br />\nrock lyrics say something vs. rock lyrics don't say<br />\nanything. But perhaps the finest and funniest article is<br />\nthe one by Tom Wolfe of Electric Acid Kool Aid Test<br />\nand Pump House Gang fame: In his typically offhand,<br />\nfast paced style, Wolfe treats the rock phenomenon of<br />\nthe groupie and gives the vestal virgins of the rock<br />\nmusicians something to look for \u2014 an identity of their<br />\nown.<br />\nAll in all, though, these three works are<br />\ndisappointing. They are trying to explain a cultural<br />\nphenomenon which is still happening, which is still in<br />\nflux, and probably always will be. An to top it all, they<br />\nhave proceeded to jump on the commerical bandwagon<br />\nand review the goods while they are hot. They fail and it<br />\nis lucky that they do.

Many<br />\npeople, especially those who never read<br />\nparty platforms, believe that they are<br />\nunimportant documents. This position<br />\nis not entirely specious. Officers of<br />\ngovernment are obviously entirely free<br />\nto ignore the platform on which they<br />\nwere elected. In some cases, this is<br />\nnecessary for efficacy in administration<br />\nof government. There has never been<br />\nmuch support for the incredible dictates<br />\npolicies which a President can neither<br />\ncompromise nor expand upon.<br />\nPolyglot Party<br />\nNevertheless, the platform has its<br />\nsignificance as the only or principal<br />\nstatement of a national party in<br />\nc nvention assembled. It is<br />\napproximately all on which a polyglot<br />\nparty can agree. Frequently a careful<br />\nreading of a platform is rewarding, not<br />\nas a detailed index to the party's<br />\nprospective course of action, but as<br />\nindicating a general approach to<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nThis is not to say that the platform is<br />\nnot packed with statements which are<br />\nnot to be construed as revelatory. Even<br />\nin the early days of short platforms,<br />\neach document contained certain<br />\nglittering generalities to which even the<br />\nopposition party could not well object.<br />\nHowever, there is often an emphasis on<br />\nlimited government, Presidential<br />\nassertiveness, or some such philosophy<br />\nwhich is of relevance to an<br />\nunderstanding of the organization<br />\nsponsoring the platform.<br />\nThe chief interest in the 1904<br />\nDemocratic platform was the extent to<br />\nwhich the party, now sponsoring Alton<br />\nB. Parker, would repudiate its recent<br />\n(and only interrupted) past under<br />\nWilliam Jennings Bryan. In 1896, when<br />\nBryan forces sized control of the party<br />\nfrom the forces of President Cleveland,<br />\nit was generally believed that the<br />\nplatrorm's repudiation of Cleveland was<br />\nentire and absolute. A result so decisive<br />\nwas not to be anticipated in 1904, for<br />\nthe leaders of the Convention had a<br />\n<br />\ndistinct fear of Bryan's power.<br />\nSpecifically, it was generally believed<br />\nthat Justice Parker would be dynamited<br />\nif he failed to receive Bryan's<br />\nendorsement. It was also feared that, if<br />\nthe platform were packed with<br />\ninferential repudiations of Bryan, the<br />\nNebraskan's considerable forensic<br />\nability would be applied in behalf of<br />\nconvention dissidents.<br />\nTherefore the platform was drafted<br />\nin close consultation with Bryan, and<br />\ncertain planks were distinctly to his<br />\nliking. An example of this has already<br />\nbeen provided, in the discussion of how<br />\nBryan caused the omission of a plank<br />\nstating that the currency standard was<br />\nno longer a compaign issue.<br />\nThis helps clarify the importance of<br />\nJustice Parker's previously discussed<br />\ntelegram affirming the gold standard.<br />\nThe telegram, cited as the height of<br />\ncourage and honor by the pro-Pakrer<br />\npress, was in fact only a mixed victory.<br />\nIt did demonstrate force on the part of<br />\nParker, but it also antagonized Bryan.<br />\nParker forces entirely vanquished Bryan<br />\nforces in the Convention; nevertheless,<br />\nas we shall see, the campaign would be<br />\ncharacterized by recurring questions of<br />\nthe depth of Bryan's commitment to<br />\nParker.<br />\nNo Position<br />\nPakrer's display of force cannot be<br />\ndeprecated as overly assertive, since<br />\nconcession to Bryan was already<br />\nembodied in the platform. There were<br />\nthree particular progressive planks. One<br />\nwas a simple declaration in favor of<br />\ndirect election of senators, one of the<br />\ncrusades of Bryan. In this as in most<br />\nother public issues, Parker had not<br />\nexpressed a position.<br />\nThe declaration concerning<br />\nimperialism suffers from ambiguity of<br />\nlanguage, but in general it is consonant<br />\nwith the Bryan anti-Imperialism<br />\ncampaign of 1900. It is delcared that all<br />\nAmerican possessions should enjoy the<br />\nfull rights of the mainland; or, to use<br />\nthe phrase of the day, the Constitution<br />\nshoul; follow the flag. Of course the<br />\nSupreme Court Insular Cases decision of<br />\n1902 had allowed considerable latitude<br />\nto colonial administration, but beyond<br />\n<br />\nperadventure the Democrats adopted a<br />\ntenable position.<br />\nThe platform also advocates that the<br />\nPhilippine, like Cuba, be promised<br />\nindependence upon achieving stability.<br />\nThis is not to be construed as a promise<br />\nof imminent independence, and even<br />\nRepublicans were wont to concede that<br />\nthe Philippines would not be held<br />\nforever. Nevertheless, the suggestion<br />\nthat the Philippines may be as worthy<br />\nof independence as Cuba represents<br />\nsome advance over the position of<br />\nprominent Republicans.<br />\nThe discussion of trusts also owes<br />\nsome thing to Bryan. The moral<br />\nindictment of trusts is the occasion for<br />\nthe most splendid language in the<br />\nplatform. A public monopoly is<br />\nindefensible and intolerable. The<br />\nsuggestions for curbing trusts are not as<br />\nadvanced as would be offered in the<br />\nnext ten years. The Democrats<br />\nadvocated a strenthening of the<br />\nInterstate Commerce Commission.<br />\nAlso, it is suggested that interstate<br />\nmonopolies should not be permitted to<br />\noperate outside the state of their origin.<br />\nIt must be noted that the Republicans<br />\nwere equally willing to issue a general<br />\ncondemantion of monopoly, and their<br />\nown declarations on the subject are not<br />\nentirely optimistic.<br />\nThere is some interest in the tariff<br />\nplank. Twenty years before, the tariff<br />\nwas the principal issue dividing the<br />\nparties. Democrats would style the<br />\nprotective tariff as unconstitutional;<br />\nRepublicans would become rhapsodic<br />\nover the plight of infant industries and<br />\nthe savage threat to national prosperity<br />\nwhich would accompany a reduction in<br />\nrates. Of course there were Democratic<br />\nprotectionists and Republican<br />\nrevisionists, and attention had gradually<br />\nfocused on social issues of greater<br />\nimportance than the tariff.<br />\nThis was the principal educational<br />\nfunction of the Bryan campaign of<br />\n1896. Bryan deliberately relegated the<br />\ntariff to the second rank of campaign<br />\nissues when he thundered, \"Protection<br />\nhas slain its thousands, but the gold<br />\nstandard has slain its tens of<br />\ntIiousands.\"<br />\n<br />\nOne suspects also that the public ,<br />\nattention span concerning tariff<br />\narguments was limited. During and after 1896, there are several journalistic<br />\nreferences to an earlier period when<br />\nexcitement about the tariff was more<br />\nintense. The significance of the 1904<br />\nplank is that. unlike the famous<br />\nCleveland plank of 1892, it does not<br />\nindict protection as unconstitutional.<br />\nProtection is no longer inherently<br />\nobjectionable, but is objectionalble,<br />\nbecause of its alleged efficacy in<br />\nmothering trusts.<br />\nSince it would be out of character<br />\nfor a Parker platform to promise radical<br />\nchange, we are promised only \"revision<br />\nand gradual reduction.\" This is<br />\nsomewhat in advance of the Republican<br />\nposition.<br />\nMost of the planks are of insufficient<br />\nimportance to receive notation in this<br />\nnecessarily limited discussion. President<br />\nRoosevelt is scalded as a spendthrift,<br />\nand the Democrats advocate a return to<br />\n\"Jeffersonian simplicity of livng.\"<br />\nJefferson introduced the fingerbowl<br />\ninto America, lived in a palatial fashion<br />\nbeyond his means at Monticello, and<br />\nwas not unacquainted with servants and<br />\ncoaches. He did affect simplicity in his<br />\ninitial years in the Presidency, the better<br />\nto draw a contrast with the pieceding<br />\nFederalist presidents. Any reference to<br />\nJeffersonian simplicity is based on<br />\npolitical expediency rather than a<br />\nperceptive study of history.<br />\nThe most arresting part of the<br />\nplatform characterizes the Roosevelt<br />\nadministration as \"spasmodic,<br />\nsensational, spectacular and arbitrary.\"<br />\nThis is a good range of adjectives. There<br />\nare Roosevelt admirers who would<br />\nconede the efficacy of the expression,<br />\nalthough the Democrats desired to<br />\narouse massive hungering for the<br />\nconservatism of Justice Parker.<br />\nIn general, the platform is a<br />\ncompromise between the Cleveland and<br />\nBryan positions. Some pronouncements<br />\nare distinctly progressive; elsewhere it is<br />\nmanifested that the Democrats propose<br />\nan absence of radical change.<br />\nNext week, I shall commence<br />\ndiscussion of the fall campaign.<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\n\f-<br />\n<br />\nOct. 10, 1969 \u2022 .1<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nSh,rinkology:Ws a Flipped-out Wizard<br />\nBy LIONEL MARKS<br />\nReview the Jack Bruce album, that's<br />\nwhat I am going to do - - right? What's<br />\nin a record review? History, a little<br />\nsociology, a lot of psychoanalysis. All<br />\nabout music - - but that's apples and<br />\npears - - right? Do it anyway, lots of<br />\nfun, but keep it harmless.<br />\nJust in case the only records you see<br />\nare the ones in the bookstore, Jack<br />\nBruce has an album out called Songsfor<br />\nTailor. Ten songs, all \"composed and<br />\narranged\" (se the liner notes say) by<br />\nBruce with lyrics by Pete Brown, the<br />\nsame combination that gave you that<br />\nTop 40 smash, \"White Room\". Bruce<br />\nplays the bass, piano, organ and acoustic<br />\nguitar. Pete Brown just smokes dope<br />\nand listens to the sounds. Also playing<br />\non the album are Chris Spedding and<br />\nGeorge Harrison on the guitar; Jon<br />\nWiseman and John Marshall, drums;<br />\nHarvey Beckett and Henry Luther,<br />\ntrumpets; and Dick Heckstall-Smith and<br />\nArt Themen, saxes. Felix Pappelardi,<br />\nwhose claim to fame is that he was<br />\naround when the Cream was, also plays<br />\nthe guitar in a few cuts. But all this crap<br />\ngives you the wrong impression. This<br />\nalbum is all Bruce's. After the hassled<br />\nend of the Cream,(Bruce had more grief<br />\nfor Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker in a<br />\nsummer issue of the Rolling Stone),<br />\nBruce seems to have escaped all the<br />\nproblems of a group by being one. The<br />\ndominating sounds on the album are the<br />\nbass and piano; the horns have been<br />\narranged by Bruce.<br />\n<br />\nPete Brown's lyrics do not seem to<br />\ndistract from the Bruce music as they<br />\nhave in the past. This time Brown just<br />\ngives Bruce a chance to use his voice.<br />\nThere are no politico lyrics, none of<br />\nthat message crap, and no \"Cheez my<br />\nbaby done left me so I'm gonna<br />\ncomment o the sad state of the British<br />\neconomy while I find a new one\" songs.<br />\nOn this album, the best of Brown's<br />\nlyrics are close to the music, healthily<br />\nperverse.<br />\nIt's hang the girls and young men<br />\nOn the ropes of tweedy mind<br />\nThe speedy sneaking tongueme.i<br />\nHave left them all behind<br />\nIt's all tripe and no liver<br />\nAt the Cafe of the Neat<br />\nThe cooks jumped in the river<br />\nThe menu smells of feet<br />\nAt worst, Brown's words are<br />\nharmless, letting the music and Bruce's<br />\nvoice come through. That's fine. Good<br />\nlyrics don't hurt, just as soon have<br />\nthem. But the album is Bruce's \u2014 the<br />\ncover says so.<br />\nLead Bass<br />\nThe class cuts on the album have to<br />\nbe \"Never Tell Your Mother She's Out<br />\nof Tune\", \"Theme for an Imaginary<br />\nWestern\", \"Ticket to Waterfalls\" and<br />\n\"To Isengard\". There really is not a bad<br />\ncut, but if you've heard \"As You Said\"<br />\nfrom \"Wheels of Fire\" you've heard<br />\nthree or four of the songs on this album.<br />\nBruce plays acoustic guitar well, but it's<br />\nbeen done before.<br />\n\"Never Tell Your Mother She's Out<br />\nof Tune\", the first cut on the record,<br />\n<br />\nlets you know what you are going to be<br />\nlistening to for the next ten cuts.<br />\nBruce's bass, Bruce's voice, and<br />\nanything else that he might want to<br />\nthrow in to accompany him. The bass is<br />\nthe lead instrument: it holds the<br />\nmelody, takes the instrumental solos, in<br />\nfact, does everything that you might<br />\nhave expected of a guitar. But listen to<br />\n\"Spoonful\" and you'll see that Bruce<br />\nhas been playing a lead bass for a long<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe bass on the first song is the<br />\nclosest to the way he played with<br />\nCream. It's fast, faster than you can<br />\nbelieve. Not as subtle as some of the<br />\nother cuts but neither is the song. The<br />\ntrumpets and saxes are competent,<br />\nplaying tight-knit arrangements. George<br />\nHarrison, (once again, L'Angelo<br />\nMisterioso) cannot even be heard. No<br />\none complains, its a good song.<br />\nSaage Muskian<br />\nThe second cut, \"Theme for an<br />\nImaginary Western\", is just the sort of<br />\nthing that Bruce fanatics have been<br />\nwaiting for. Bruce is probably the<br />\nbest-trained musician in rock music<br />\n(studied the cello in a Scottish<br />\nconservatory until he was 14) and this<br />\nsong shows some of the discipline.<br />\nUsually a savage musician, he keeps it<br />\ncontrolled here. The progressions are<br />\nthe usual rock changes. Piano dominates<br />\nin this cut and Bruce reveals that he is<br />\ncompetent on that instrument, easily<br />\nmore competent than most of the dudes<br />\nwho are making a living playing<br />\nkeyboards for rock groups.<br />\n<br />\n\"To Isengard\", one of the last songs<br />\non the album, is probably the biggest<br />\nsurprise. A ballad, in the old English<br />\nstyle, with mystical lyrics? (Isengard,<br />\nhome of Suraman the White, master of<br />\nWormtongue \u2014 one flipped out wizard;<br />\nbig, messy battle with all the Tolkein<br />\ncreatures running in and out.) Take a<br />\nquick look to see if Pete Brown had the<br />\ngood taste with a lot of literary delusion<br />\ncrap. Nope. Just a love song.<br />\nOnce again, Bruce keeps it all<br />\nsubdued. The guitar work, by Bruce,<br />\nSpedding and Pappalardi takes over. For<br />\na moment the bass plays a normal role,<br />\nbut nothing suffers.<br />\nApples and Pears<br />\nI guess everyone has got the idea by<br />\nnow. Jack Bruce's album is a fine one.<br />\nThe bass work and musical knowledge<br />\nthat held Cream together and let Blind<br />\nFaith fall apart, despite all the talent it<br />\nhad, are on this album. But if there is<br />\nanything bad to be said about 'Songsfor<br />\na Tailor' it's this: he needs some<br />\nmusicians of his caliber to play with. If<br />\nyou are not a bass-nut, it might bore<br />\nyou eventually. Even if you are, it<br />\nwould still be nice to hear some other<br />\nsounds.<br />\nSolution: buy Bruce's next album on<br />\nwhich he plays with Larry Coryell,<br />\npossibly the finest and easily the<br />\nleast-known rock guitarist. In the<br />\nmeantime, this album is fine. This has<br />\nbeen nice, but in the wrong direction.<br />\nMusic, words, that's apples and pears.<br />\nJust buy the album.<br />\n<br />\nVeritas<br />\n<br />\nFICIassive Breaded 'Chop Engulfs Dormsin Slime I<br />\nBy AHMAD SHEIKHOLISLAM<br />\nSAGA Dormitory Food Service has<br />\ndisplayed a spectrum of culnary quality<br />\nWhich ranges from Saturday night steak<br />\nPlatters down to plates of visual interest<br />\nsuch as the \"breaded pork chop\"<br />\nPictured here.<br />\nThe pictured SAGA presentation was<br />\nPresented to a Hopkins upper classman<br />\non Tuesday, October 7th.

SAGA men also<br />\nexplained that there were three entrees<br />\non Tuesday; the student in question<br />\nnamed his own poison, metaphorically<br />\n<br />\nspeaking. Why didn't this student take<br />\nthe \"fish\" or \"Cassarole\" entrees?<br />\nThe \"pork chop's\" recipient<br />\nexplained that the fish looked worse<br />\nthan the \"chop\". Haynes Mahoney, a<br />\nJunior, rejected both fish and chops,<br />\nand chose the cassarole. \"It was,\" he<br />\nexplained, \"terrible. My grandfather ate<br />\nbetter (substance) than that at Valley<br />\nForge.\"<br />\nVince Price, as Food Committee<br />\nchairman, explained, \"We do not<br />\nmaintain that average SAGA food is at<br />\n<br />\nthis low point. But neither will we<br />\nignore the fact that unfortunate meals<br />\noccur at SAGA. At times the food is<br />\nbad. At times, fortunately rare, the food<br />\nis odious. There is a general, though<br />\nsilent, distaste for SAGA among<br />\ndormitory residents. It usually takes the<br />\nform of sardonic humor, but behind<br />\nevery joke is an omelet that fell<br />\nthrough, a cassarole with a vengeance, or<br />\na pork chop such as this.\"<br />\nAsked why he wanted to exhibit the<br />\n\"pork chop,\" Price explained that<br />\n<br />\n\"Dormitory Residents have no power of<br />\nappeal over SAGA. If SAGA serves<br />\noffensive food, dorm residents are<br />\nforced to eat it. This should impel<br />\nSAGA to make every effort to please<br />\nstudents. Usually students are, if not<br />\npleased, at least satisfied. But if SAGA<br />\nfalls through, what can the average<br />\nstudent do? Last year the average<br />\nstudents got together and staged a food<br />\nriot. This year violent upheavals of<br />\nSAGA food by dorm residents will<br />\nresult in strict disciplinary action.

It is also<br />\npossible to complain via House<br />\nPresidents, or by dropping a complaint<br />\nin Box 2062. Membership in the DSRC<br />\nFood Committee is open to all dorm<br />\nresidents; those interested should<br />\ncontact Price.<br />\nSAGA men declared that if any<br />\nentree should be the object of general<br />\ncriticism by dorm residents, the recipe<br />\nwould be thrown out and the entree<br />\nnever again served. SAGA explains that<br />\nit attempts to work for and with dorm<br />\nresidents; they are responsive to the<br />\ndesires of the students.<br />\nOn the other hand, a resigned senior,<br />\nviewing the Tuesday mail, commented<br />\nwryly that \"Hopkins eats shit.\"<br />\nCORRECTION....<br />\nIn last week's issue we omitted the<br />\nby-line for the Veritas column.

Granted that this war has<br />\nbred many incidents like it. The fact is that never has<br />\nsuch behavior been so openly condoned by those who<br />\ncontrol this country.<br />\nOn Tuesday, October 1, we were informed that the<br />\nGreen Berets accused of murdering a Vietnamese had<br />\nbeen freed. There would be no trial. It was a matter of<br />\nnational security. And how could they be judged by<br />\nthose who were putting them on trial?<br />\nBarry Sadler<br />\nAfter the Green Berets had been released, it was<br />\nrevealed that they had some friends in Congress who had<br />\nbeen urging the Pentagon to drop the case. Senator<br />\nThurmond \u2014 \"I was confident the Nixon Administration<br />\nwould not prosecute these men as such action is not in<br />\nthe nature of the President and Defense Secretary<br />\nLaird.\" Mendel Rivers pledged that the accused men<br />\nwould be restored to duty with clean records. \"Take it<br />\nfrom me, we will see to it, for you and the American<br />\npeople, that their records will be clean.\" Thurmond<br />\nunderstood perfectly the \"nature\" of Nixon and Laird.<br />\nThe case was dropped.<br />\nAfter his release Colonel Rheault, he of the Barry<br />\nSadlers and Robin Moores and John Waynes, said \u2014 \"I<br />\ndon't think you can make the terminology homicide.<br />\nWar is a difficult and dangerous business. People get<br />\nkilled in war. This is not to be considered homocide.\"<br />\nBernard Fall<br />\nIf it is not homocide, i.e. murder, then what is it? If it<br />\nis not homocide, then neither was Dachau and<br />\nBuchenwald. If it is not homocide, then anything is<br />\npossible. When this is condoned by the people who<br />\ncontrol us, when it is clear that these people haven't the<br />\ncapacity to feel, only to manipulate and posture, then<br />\nthere is no scale of evil that is beyond us.<br />\nThe incident reminded me of several days spent with<br />\nan American Foreign Service officer who had spent<br />\nmany years in Vietnam. He spoke of the frequency with<br />\nwhich Americans simply shot or had removed many of<br />\n<br />\nthose who went against them. He went on to speak<br />\nabout a fellow foreign service officer who had been<br />\nordered by the military to have Bernard Fall<br />\n\"eliminated.\" The officers resigned. A couple of days<br />\nlater, it was reported that Fall had stepped on a mine,<br />\n\"There is no way you could prove it, but I'm sure they<br />\nkilled him.\"<br />\nThe question of whether or not the slain man was or<br />\nwas not a double agent, or whether or not Fall was<br />\nmurdered is in the end irrelevant. Murder over there is a<br />\nfact of life. As with other countries who have found<br />\nhuman life something less than sacred in this century,<br />\nmurder is always something else. Whatever it is, it has a<br />\nnoble purpose, and it is not homocide.<br />\nWe are left with the words of Pham Kim Lien, the<br />\nwife of the slain man \u2014 \"the soul of my husband will<br />\n<br />\nfollow those who killed him.\" It is a primitive curse, but<br />\nit is on us, not on the men who killed him.<br />\nWhere He Stands<br />\nThere is no purpose here in discussing how much this<br />\ndirty war has corrupted this country and distorted<br />\nhuman values. Too many know this. The (,ase of the<br />\nGreen Berets is one more instance where the President<br />\nhas clearly let us know where he stands. The day after<br />\nthe Green Berets were released, he cut 42% off aid to the<br />\ncities.<br />\nThere are those who wished for Nixon's election<br />\nbecause they felt his mentality would bring the conflicts<br />\nof this country to a head. They felt he would make his<br />\nposition clear, thus making it possible, if not mandatory,<br />\nto react against him. It seems to me that we are at that<br />\npoint.<br />\n<br />\nBridge<br />\n<br />\nWatch the Bidding!<br />\n\u2014<br />\nV CI 94O A #42<br />\n+ Akca64-3<br />\n<br />\n4:S<br />\n<br />\nAxG53<br />\nV KS 86<br />\n<br />\n+10<br />\n+J.987<br />\n<br />\neN 94<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\n\u2022lo 7 5<br />\nO K GJ 9853<br />\n4'10<br />\n<br />\ne> A KO lo 8 72<br />\n\u2713 A 32<br />\n+6<br />\n4. 52<br />\nIt is very important in bridge to pay close attention<br />\nto the opponent's bidding.

Bruce Leslie<br />\nDAY OF CONSCIENCE<br />\nTo the Hopkins Community:<br />\nIn the past few weeks there<br />\nhas been much controversy<br />\nconcerning the National<br />\n<br />\nVietnam Moratorium on<br />\nOctober 15th. On campus, the<br />\ntwo main questions concern the<br />\nappropriateness and<br />\neffectiveness of the moratorium.<br />\nPeople have argued that the<br />\nmoratorium is a misdirected<br />\nat tack detrimental to the<br />\nstudent's best interests and an<br />\nineffective method of changing<br />\ngovernment policy. These<br />\narguments against the<br />\nmoratorium are wrong.<br />\nOctober 15th is a day for all<br />\npeople of conscience to put<br />\naside their everyday business and<br />\nwork for peace by opposing the<br />\ngovernment's policy and calling<br />\nfor an immediate American<br />\ntroop withdrawal. The student<br />\nwill not be hurt by refraining<br />\nfrom classes. The conventional<br />\neducation forfeited will be<br />\namply replaced by education<br />\nand national policy discussion<br />\nduring the moratorium. More<br />\nimportantly, however, the<br />\nVietnam war is not in the best<br />\ninterest of the country either<br />\npolitically, socially or<br />\neconomically, and since the<br />\n<br />\nstudent is a part of this country,<br />\nit could not be in his best<br />\ninterest either.<br />\nThe moratorium strategy has<br />\nnever been attempted before and<br />\ntherefore it could not possibly<br />\nbe known whether it is an<br />\neffective means of changing<br />\ngovernment policy. The strategy<br />\ncalls for a sustained effort<br />\ntowards building a broad-based<br />\npolitical movement to end the<br />\nwar. Protest against the war will<br />\nbe concentrated in a moratroium<br />\non \"business as usual\" for one<br />\nday in October, two days in<br />\nNovember, three in December,<br />\nand continuing in this pattern<br />\nuntil the war is over.<br />\nThe moratorium puts its faith<br />\nin the people of this country. It<br />\nasks for a simple committment<br />\nfrom the people in order to end<br />\na senseless, immoral war. One<br />\ncannot be sincerely opposed to<br />\nthe war and at the same time,<br />\nnot be willing to make this<br />\ncommittment.

Mark Reutter, for<br />\nhandling the technically difficult<br />\nand emotionally sensitive<br />\nmaterial surrounding the Jensen<br />\nreport so well. It was<br />\nparticularly astute journalism to<br />\npoint out who had read the<br />\nreport before entring opinions<br />\nand who had not read it. I would<br />\nalso like to correct one small<br />\nmatter. I said that Hopkins<br />\ncould expect to have about a<br />\ntwo per cent black student<br />\nbody, not \"faculty,\" as the<br />\narticle indicated. The<br />\nlower-bound for Hopkins'<br />\nfaculty SAT scores is very likely<br />\nat least 100 points higher than<br />\nthe lower-bound for students.<br />\n(In general, it is desirable not to<br />\nhave teachers be less able than<br />\nstudents.) This would be<br />\nbetween one and two standard<br />\ndeviations higher still on the<br />\nblack distribution, and the<br />\nproportion of blacks scoring at<br />\nthat level or higher would be<br />\nmuch less than two per cent of<br />\nthe black high school graduates:<br />\nin fact, it would be between nine<br />\nin thirty thousand and one in<br />\nthirty thousand. (In contrast,<br />\nfifteen out of every hundred<br />\nwhites who take the SAT, score<br />\nat that level or higher.) Since<br />\nblacks graduate from high school<br />\nat a lower rate than whites, my<br />\ntwo per cent estimate for this<br />\nstudent body was itself a bit too<br />\nhigh, probably by a factor of<br />\nabout 25 per cent. This would<br />\nindicate that Hopkins is doing<br />\nquite well in having two per cent<br />\nblacks amongst its entering<br />\nfreshmen. The problem of<br />\nfinding black professors is also<br />\nhighlighted by these figures.<br />\nThe relative availablity of<br />\nhighly able blacks to serve as<br />\nHopkins faculty would also<br />\ndepend on their occupational<br />\npreferences. It is not<br />\nunreasonable to suppose that<br />\nhighly able blacks might accord<br />\nhigher priority to occupations<br />\nother than that of professor. Of<br />\nthose who choose to be<br />\nprofessors, some remain at<br />\nNegro institutions they are<br />\nunwilling to desert. while others<br />\nare already at predominantly<br />\nwhite institutions, and it is not<br />\nclear whose purpose might be<br />\nserved by shifting them from<br />\none to antoher of these<br />\nuniversities. It is one thing to<br />\nissue emotional appells for<br />\nhiring black faculty that win<br />\nfavor with the studi.nt body and<br />\nplace the University in a bad<br />\nlight, and anotliei to try to<br />\neducate students so that they<br />\n<br />\ncomprehend the true magnitude<br />\nof the problem.<br />\nRobert A. Gordon<br />\nAssociate Professor<br />\nDepartment of Social Relations<br />\nJENSEN ANALYSIS<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am a graduate student<br />\nworking oil a full-time basis in<br />\nthe area of human gentics.<br />\nAlthough I do not claim to be an<br />\nexpert on the subject of racial<br />\ndifferences in intelligence, many<br />\npeople on campus have asked me<br />\nin recent months to discuss the<br />\ntheory brought forth by Dr.<br />\nArthur Jensen to the effect that<br />\nU.S. Negroes perform at a lower<br />\nwhites on<br />\nlevel than<br />\nstandardized IQ tests because of<br />\ngenetic factors. What follows<br />\nhere is my attempt to analyze<br />\nsome of the arguments behind<br />\nthis view in as scientific a<br />\nmanner as possible.<br />\nRaces are biological<br />\npopulations differing in the<br />\nfrequencies of certain genes. An<br />\nAfrican may be less or more<br />\nlikely than a Swede to have a<br />\ncertain blood type, by the Type<br />\n0 African resembles the Type 0<br />\nSwede with respect to this gene<br />\nmore han he resembles a fellow<br />\nAfrican of a different blood<br />\ntype. If there are hereditary<br />\nfactors influencing IQ score or<br />\nintelligence, it is likely that races<br />\nwould differ in the frequencies<br />\nof the factors. It is, however,<br />\nunlikely that many factors<br />\nwuuld be present in one race and<br />\nabsent in another race.<br />\nFurthermore, the group known<br />\nas \"Negroes\" in the U.S. is really<br />\na mixed race of African and<br />\nEttiopean descent. Estimates of<br />\nthe European contribution<br />\ngenerally iange around the<br />\ntwenty percent figure.<br />\nThus, before a piofessional<br />\nge ietic:st would like to make a<br />\nconclusion about race<br />\ndifferences in intelligence, he<br />\nwould probably wish to have<br />\nsome biochemical evidence as to<br />\nwhat factors were responsible<br />\nfor intelligence and their<br />\ndistribution over the races of<br />\nmankind.<br />\nAccording to Montague,<br />\nstudies exist which show that<br />\nNegroes and othei groups living<br />\nin extremely poor condictions<br />\ntend to experience a marked<br />\nupward shift in IQ when their<br />\nsurr oundings are drastically<br />\nimproved. The Osage Indians,<br />\nfor example, had a 20-point shift<br />\nin the mean IQ score shortly<br />\nafter oil was discovered on their<br />\nreservation and a consequent<br />\nimprovement in education was<br />\nmade.<br />\nThe most hazardous<br />\nconclusion to be drawn fi om the<br />\n\"Jensen report\" is that Negroes<br />\nbe taught skills requiring a low<br />\ndegree of abstract intelligence.<br />\nmight wonder whether the<br />\nOne<br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nwriter would advocate a<br />\nService<br />\nsugar-free diet for diabetics.<br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT Aside from humanitarian<br />\nconsiderations, these courses of<br />\n3330 GREENMOUNTAVE action are not acceptable as<br />\n467-2123<br />\nprofessional recommendations in<br />\nthe field of human genetics.<br />\nGeneticists realize that all are<br />\n\u2014 WHAT EXACTLY does the Nixon<br />\nnot created equal in every<br />\nAdministration think about busing?

In desperation I called for a<br />\nsmaller meeting.\"<br />\nDead End<br />\nAt that meeting two weeks later, Mr.<br />\nRonald Owen, the new recently<br />\nappointed assistant director of<br />\nadmissions, announced that Brinkley<br />\nhad sa..1 admissions were closed and the<br />\nstudents Cotter selected would under no<br />\ncircumstances be accepted.<br />\n\"I learned a lot from this and I made<br />\na lot of mistakes.

Dean Kimball<br />\nclaimed that he never made a promise of<br />\ntutorial help. \"It is my opinion and the<br />\nopinion of many others including black<br />\nstudents on camps and the Negro<br />\npeople in the community that tutoring<br />\nis not a suitable program for Hopkins.<br />\nThis is not because of our interests,\" the<br />\nliberal arts dean contended, \"but<br />\nbecause of the interests of the students<br />\ninvolved. The University should not<br />\nmislead students here ... Why? It just<br />\ncan't be done with their background, I<br />\ndon't know the technicalities; talk to<br />\nothers about the actual statistics, but I<br />\nknow that they were in the range of<br />\n300-250 in their SAT's.\"<br />\n(Cotter's figures show that only one<br />\nof the five students who took the SAT<br />\nscored below 300. One student received<br />\nscores 657 verbal and 591 math and the<br />\nlowest academic average of the high<br />\nschoolers was 79.6).<br />\n<br />\nformalized tutoring has serious<br />\ndisadvantages for the student. \"It's one<br />\nthing to be enthusiastic about bringing<br />\nstudents here and another being<br />\nenthusiastic over individual students.Swanson maintained. \"Tutoring<br />\nstudents for four years so that they can<br />\nget a degree here is wrong. They would<br />\nthen get second class treatment. If they<br />\nare continually required to bc tutored,<br />\nthen they would never feel a part of this<br />\nplace.In the admissions department.<br />\nRonald Owen was unimpressed with<br />\nCotter's attempts to increase black<br />\nenrollment at Homewood. \"Bob has<br />\nperpetrated a very difficult situation. He<br />\ninsisted that even if only three or four<br />\nof the thirteen students made it here<br />\nthat this would prove something.

Wilson Shaffer completed plans to do<br />\naway with admissions charges to university sporting events<br />\nand the policy of trading guarantees with other schools. It<br />\nwas a Noble Experiment, \"unique among American<br />\nColleges.\" The intention of this policy change was to draw<br />\na clear distinction between the use of college football and.<br />\nathletics for public amusement and college recreation.<br />\nUnder Shaffer's expanded intercollegiate (from 6 sports to<br />\n13), intramural, and physical education program initiated<br />\nin 1934, 92 per cent of Hopkins undergraduates were<br />\ninvolved as compared to 15 per cent under the old system.<br />\n<br />\nIn the opening game on Tuesday, the<br />\nHopkins varsity soccer team put on a<br />\ntremendous show by crushing the<br />\nUniversity of Delaware, 4-1.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins won the toss and after one brief<br />\nat each side of the field, the Jays turned<br />\nflurry<br />\nBut now thirty-two years later we of Hopkins find our alma<br />\non<br />\nthe<br />\nspeed and scored at :55 of the opening<br />\nnecessity.<br />\nmater renewing the admissions charge due to financial<br />\nperiod.<br />\nWenker, taking a.perfect pass from<br />\nBernie<br />\nAlthough no lodger directly related to the athletic program, gate<br />\nRon aOWes,\"16op'ed the ball over thdheact of the<br />\nthe<br />\nfrom<br />\nwhich<br />\nfund<br />\nreceipts still go into the same general university<br />\nstartled U. 41-, Delaware goalie.

Professors, their<br />\nThe reasoning is that if the professors had to pay many of them<br />\nwouldn't come and it was felt that as much encouragement as<br />\npossible should be employed if we wanted to involve the faculty in<br />\nthe non-academic parts of the university. We see nothing wrong with<br />\nthis side of the policy.<br />\nBut then why in the same sense of encouragement must students<br />\npay for their wives or dates? Admittedly we are a much larger<br />\nproportion of the potential attendance and the university is out to<br />\nmake money through admission charges which they would be<br />\ndeprived of if dates were allowed in free. The present reduction of<br />\nfifty cents dues not offset the inequity of this situation. In response,<br />\nMr. Bilgrave has said that he knows of no college in America that<br />\nallows dates in for free. Must the uniqueness of Hopkins be so<br />\nsubject to the tyranny of the almighty dollar and the mediocrity of<br />\nconformity?<br />\nWe ask Mr. Bilgrave to review the situation and come up with a<br />\nmore equitable solution for both the students and the faculty.<br />\nFurther reduction in the price for a date or abolition of this charge<br />\naltogether should be considered seriously.<br />\nIt has been estimated that the admissions charge will bring from<br />\nbetween $20 and $40 thousand dollars in additional revenue to the<br />\nuniversity's coffers. After the Muhlenberg game, we wonder if such<br />\nestimates are not too high. The net take for the Muhlenberg game<br />\nwas $734.50. Naturally, the big money gainers will come in the<br />\nspring with lacrosse and possibly with some late season football<br />\ngames if past attendance trends are accurate and continue despite<br />\nthe admissions charge.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Bilgrave, \"The university is hurting for money<br />\nand this is another source of income.\" In commending Hopkins'<br />\nelimination of gate charges on March 2, 1937, C.M.

Hopkins'had a scoring chance at the<br />\nsix minute mark when Lemmon got called for<br />\nhands outside the goal circle giving the Jays a<br />\npenalty kick. The shot was deflected and there<br />\nwas no further scoring until 17:34 when<br />\nLemmon, coming out to take a Hopkins shot,<br />\nmissed it, leaving a free ball and an open net. A<br />\nhead shot missed and the scoring opportunity<br />\nwas finally cashed in when Scott Tyner put it in<br />\nwith an assist going to Ron Rowes. On the play,<br />\ngoalie Lemmon was kicked in the head and had<br />\nto be replaced by Joe Owsley. Delaware finally<br />\nfound some spark and came right back downfield<br />\npressuring goalie Weiss very hard. When Hopkins<br />\ngot called for hands inside the penalty circle,<br />\nDelaware was awarded a penalty shot which Mike<br />\nBiggs converted with a solid boot into the right<br />\ncorner for a Delaware score. Weiss had no chance<br />\nto block the well-placed shot. The half ended<br />\nwith Hopkins holding a 3-1 lead.<br />\nSit On Lead<br />\nWhen the third quarter opened, it seemed like<br />\na different Hopkins soccer team was out there.<br />\nThe playing was sloppy and lackadaisical,<br />\nresulting perhaps from Hopkins' attempt to sit<br />\non their lead. At first, Delaware was unable to<br />\ntake advantage but then they started to put<br />\nheavy pressure on Weiss, who was up to the task<br />\nand was able to successfully withstand the<br />\nDelaware charege. Suddenly, Wenker got the ball,<br />\ndribbled by his man, passed the ball to Szeles<br />\nwho attempted a shot which missed, the ball<br />\ngoing to Ron Rowes, who seemed to be<br />\neverywhere. Ron promptly drilled the ball home,<br />\nSzeles assisting. The time of the goal was 15:21.<br />\nThe goal seemed to wake up the slumbering Jays,<br />\nwho then reversed their previous form and<br />\ncompletely dominated the rest of the game.

The game was a departure from<br />\nthe classic confrontation and both teams seemed<br />\ndetermined to give the game away until, with a<br />\nfew minutes to go, a Hopkins fumble near the<br />\nF&M goal line followed by an F&M fumble lead<br />\nto the final score.<br />\nTwo standouts were Dave Pickall at wide receiver and<br />\nJohn Diorio on the line possibly because they were two<br />\nof the few players who could do anything right). If the<br />\nFranklin and Marshall team had not matched us fumble<br />\nfor fumble we probably would not have come away the<br />\nvictors.<br />\nHopkins enjoyed limited success in the air as<br />\nquarterback Bob Pfeifer hit Pickall on a down and out<br />\npattern to make the initial score. Pfeifer was noticably<br />\nPoorer than he was against Muhlenberg as was shown by<br />\nhis four interceptions.<br />\nF&M Picks Off Fumble<br />\nThe F&M offense faltered when they first received<br />\nthe ball and on the ensuing punt Hopkins had possession<br />\nonce again. Here starts the real story of the game as<br />\nconfusion in the backfield was evident when a pitchout<br />\nwent into the waiting hands of an F&M lineman. It took<br />\nfour plays to put F&M ahead, 7 to 6.<br />\nIn the second period, Hopkins had their first<br />\noPportunity to watch the comedy from the better side<br />\nas a Diplomat punt sailed thirty yards straight up into<br />\nthe air and the Jays got the ball on the F&M<br />\ntwenty-eight yard line. There followed among other<br />\n<br />\nthings a fifteen yard penalty against the Jays anu a<br />\nPfeifer to Pickall pass that took the ball to the nineteen.<br />\nThen on a long post pattern, Pickall cuaght his second<br />\ntouchdown pass of the day. A faked kick led to another<br />\nPickall reception for the two-point conversion.<br />\nAnother specialty by the offensive unit (a lateral to<br />\nthe other team) set up the final score of the first half to<br />\nmake it Hopkins 14, F&M 13.<br />\nIn the third period the Franklin and Marshall team<br />\nhad the Jays completely outclassed. An interception of a<br />\nPfeifer pass led to a Diplomat score in that period. The<br />\nloss of Charlie (C.C.) Coker was quite evident at this<br />\npoint as the defense (to say the least) sagged. The last<br />\nscore of the period was a thirty-yard field goal by<br />\nDiplomat kicker, John Burnetti. This put us on the short<br />\nend of a 23.to 14 score.<br />\nMistakes Costly<br />\nTwo costly F&M mistakes in the fourth quarter gave<br />\nthe lead back to Hopkins. The first, a fumble by the<br />\nDiplomats on the Hopkins 34, led to the third<br />\ntouchdown pass from Pfeifer to Packall. The second, a<br />\npoor snap from center, led many onlookers to think the<br />\nDiplomats did not want to win after all. Getting the ball<br />\non the F&M seven, Steve Hata ran in for the score. Yet<br />\non the next kickoff, the Diplomats marched thirty-nine<br />\nyards downfield for a touchdown and the lead, 29-26.<br />\nThe Jays next drive was ended by an interception but<br />\nthey got the ball back with three minutes to go. They<br />\ndrove to the Franklin and Marshall four before handing<br />\nthe ball over to the Diplomats on a fumble with a<br />\nminute remaining.<br />\n<br />\n13EARS<br />\n<br />\nBut on the first play the Diplomat quarterback Sam<br />\nLong fumbled back to the Jays' Norm Gross. Pfeifer<br />\nthen passed to end Steve Latson to give the Jays the win<br />\nand end an otherwise perfect(?) day.

The squad had a lot of<br />\npotential, a willingness to work hard in<br />\norder to perfect itself, and great depth.<br />\nThe defense is definitely the most<br />\nstable and strongest point of the team<br />\nthis year. It is led by Goalie Bob<br />\nLarossa, and fullbacks, Duane Mangimi<br />\nand Jim Johnson, generally<br />\nacknowledged as the leader of the team.<br />\nIn two scrimmages so far against Gilman<br />\nHigh and Pomoei High School, the<br />\ndefense allowed one goal and two goals<br />\nrespectively. Furthermore, in<br />\nscrimmages against the Varsity, the<br />\nfreshmen have cut the scores down from<br />\n4-Ito either 2-1 or 1-0.<br />\nThe offense, of course, must be<br />\nstrong too in order to have a truly<br />\nsuccessful season. This part of the team<br />\nis led by Halfbacks John Fogarty, Harry<br />\nFurukawa, and Andy Smith, all of<br />\nwhom are good dribblers and great<br />\nplaymakers. These three also help<br />\ncharacterize the strong defensive play of<br />\nthe team, with their ability-tasteal, the<br />\n<br />\nball and set up good passes.<br />\nThe offensive line, nevertheless, is<br />\nrather unstable yet, due to the<br />\nexperimentation of Coach Savage during<br />\nthe two scrimmages. The most probably<br />\nlineup, though, puts Marc Heller and<br />\nChuck Robinson at the wing positions,<br />\nMark Manzione and Jeff Hamelman at<br />\nthe insides, and either Ljubomir Nacev<br />\nor Medil Waldt at the center forward<br />\nspot. Despite changes in these positions,<br />\nthe offense has still been able to put in<br />\nfive goals during the first two<br />\nscrimmages. Thus, once the line is<br />\nstablized, its drives could be very<br />\ndifficult to stop.<br />\nThough the team currently has very<br />\nfew injuries, depth is one of the main<br />\nfactors of team strength emphasized by<br />\nCoach Savage. The second team, led by<br />\nlinemen, Ed Koza and Gary Shayne,<br />\nHalfbacks Frank Roediger and Steve<br />\nBuckingham, and Fullback Jeff Epstein,<br />\nhave jsut as much ability and strength as<br />\nthe first team.<br />\nThe squad has its first test on<br />\nOctober 9th, when it battles Mt.

These bare<br />\noffices are the headquarters for the<br />\nOctober 15 moratorium, and the goal is<br />\nto get the United States out of Vietnam.<br />\nIn order to do this, the largest, broadest<br />\nanitwar movement this country has ever<br />\nseen must be assembled. Building this<br />\ncoalition is the awesome task of a thin,<br />\nex-Harvard Divinity student, Sam<br />\nBrown.<br />\nSam Brown has<br />\nbeen working for a<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nlong time to get the<br />\nNEWS<br />\nU.S. out of Southeast<br />\nAsia. He has picketed<br />\nFEATURE<br />\nand marched like<br />\nmany other people,<br />\nbut he was also the chief organizers of<br />\nSen. Eugene McCarthy's Youth<br />\nCampaign, which saw thousands and<br />\nthousands of students bring the issue of<br />\nthe war to the people. The primary<br />\nvictories that McCarthy won could have<br />\nmore eaily been credited to Brown's<br />\norganizational ability than to the<br />\n<br />\npersonal appeal oi McCarthy. Peace was<br />\nthe biggest loser at the Chicago<br />\nconvention, as Humphrey rode in on a<br />\nbarrage of clubbings and beatings.<br />\nBrown, however, has not given up, and<br />\nis presently building a nationwide<br />\nmovement that is quickly gathering<br />\nmomentum, fueled by the endorsements<br />\nof such people as Sen. George<br />\nMcGovern, John Kenneth Galbraith,<br />\nBenjamin Spock, and Richard Goodwin.<br />\nSam Brown's looks are decieving. He<br />\nis soft-spoken and has a droopy<br />\nmustache and longish hair that make<br />\nhim virtually indistinguishable from<br />\ncountless other people walking around<br />\ncollege campuses.<br />\nNixon Fraud<br />\nFor the many people who are tired<br />\nof protesting and seeing little results,<br />\nBrown has the answer. \"The war<br />\ncontinues and we just have to work.<br />\nEven though you can't guarantee<br />\nsuccess, the kind of tactic we're<br />\npursuing is the one that's most likely to<br />\nend the war and that's why people<br />\nought to do it, because I assume they<br />\nwant the war over.\"<br />\nStill others think that since Nixon is<br />\ncutting the troops and we're at the<br />\npeace table, the war will soon be over.<br />\nBrown is rather cynical about Nixon's<br />\nwillingness to get us out of Vietnam,<br />\n<br />\nand not pull his punches. \"All that stuff<br />\nis nonsense. Starting with the troop<br />\nwithdrawls, you'll see what I mean.<br />\nNixon only withdrew to the level which<br />\nJohnson set over a year ago, the level<br />\nwhere fighting can continue without<br />\nserious impairment, with 60,000 troops<br />\nwithdrawn In short, he hasn't cut in<br />\nany way into the effective fighting<br />\ncapacity in Vietnam. There are only<br />\n85,000 men in the field at any given<br />\nsingle time, and the casualty level<br />\nremains comparably high.\"<br />\n\"The draft call, of course, is an even<br />\ngreater fraud because a year ago the<br />\nit-aft call was almost 296,000 men. This<br />\nyear, by his so-called \"cut\" of 50,000<br />\nmen we have a draft call of 290,000.<br />\nPrimarily, this is because the draft calls<br />\nhave been up the last five months, and<br />\nso he then announces this big gesture,<br />\nthe net consequences of which are<br />\npractically nothing.\"<br />\n\"I<br />\nadded,<br />\nsee<br />\nno<br />\nHe<br />\nindication that Nixon has any interest in<br />\nmoving faster than he's now moving.<br />\nPeople continue to die in Vietnam. Over<br />\n2,000 have died since he announced<br />\nwe're going to start withdrawing. I see<br />\nno reason why we should continue at<br />\nthis pace, with another ten or fifteen<br />\nthousand dead before we get out. We<br />\nsimply ought to get up, and get out. To<br />\ndo this, we have an obligation now to<br />\n<br />\nbegin to build a broad-based antiwar<br />\nmovement in the country.\"<br />\nOne of the key aspects of the<br />\nmovement is the spreading uf antiwar<br />\nsentiment outsine the academic<br />\ncomniunity. Brown hopes that large<br />\nnumbers of workers will boycott work<br />\non the I 5th. \"Almost anyone, except<br />\nthe large number of working poor, can<br />\nafford to give up one day. In terms of<br />\nwhat the war is costing him in inflation,<br />\ntaxes, and interest rates, he can't afford<br />\nnot to give up that time to work against<br />\nit. It is, of course, probably tougher for<br />\na labor union guy to wear a black<br />\narmband in his plant than it is for a<br />\nstudent to give up school.\"<br />\nThe response to the moratorium has<br />\nbeen widespread. It has gotton support<br />\nfrom all segments of the community,<br />\nand, surprisingly, a boost from Nixon's<br />\ncommeat concerning the moratorium<br />\nthat \"uVer no circumstances will I be<br />\naffected whatever by it.\" The remark<br />\nworked to ally many previously neutral<br />\npeople on the side of the moratorium.<br />\nThe press coverage has been extensive,<br />\nwith major stores running almost daily<br />\nin the news media. The most fervent<br />\nsupport has come from the universities.<br />\nAs Brown says, \"The response has been<br />\nrather incredible in the academic<br />\ncommunity, with a wide variety of<br />\nschools supporting it.\"<br />\n(Continued on page 5)<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nJackie Judos Jew<br />\n<br />\nPriest Jailed<br />\nA Roman Catholic priests request for immediate<br />\nrelease from the Dane County Jail has been denied, even<br />\nthough, according to the presiding judge, James Doyle,<br />\nFather James Groppi was confined \"without the benefit<br />\nof any of those protections normally considered<br />\nessential to due process of law.\"<br />\nFather Groppi led three days of welfare protests on<br />\nthe state Capitol, aimed at forcing the legislature to<br />\nreverse its curtailment of welfare and urban anti-poverty<br />\nfunds, and culminating in an 11-hour takeover of the<br />\nWisconsin State Assembly chambers.

They carried hand-lettered<br />\nsigns saying, \"Crybaby. you make me sick/Go Away\"<br />\nand \"Mario hates kids,\" and shouted such sentiments as<br />\n\"you're a racist, Mario\" and \"A vote for Mario is a vote<br />\nfor Wallace\"<br />\nThey also shouted, \"End hate in the city.\" A woman<br />\nin the group who had been shouting unprintable names<br />\nin Spanish at Procaccino explained her position. \"I hate<br />\nProcaccino,\" she said. \"He hates the poor people; he just<br />\nwants to put them down.\"<br />\nIn the midst of the protestors, a lone Procaccino<br />\nsupporter shouted, \"Viva Mario, get this garbage off the<br />\nstreet\" in Spanish. At the end of the tour, Procaccino<br />\nhad a word with a supporter. \"Ben Franklin says, 'It's<br />\nbetter to do it well than to say it well,'\" said the<br />\ncandidate. \"Lindsay, he says a lot and doesn't do<br />\nanything at all.\" The quotation appears in none of the<br />\nstandard reference books.

If that is not possible<br />\nthey will be asked to discuss in class why they will not<br />\nparticipate in the Moratorium.

The<br />\nviolence that lurks below the city is ugly<br />\nand vicious, and needs the smallest thing<br />\nto trigger itself off.\"<br />\nSpeaking before the AWARE group last<br />\nTuesday night, Parren Mitchell, Professor of<br />\nSociology at Morgan State College, gave a<br />\npessimistic articulation of the dismal<br />\npolitico-socio-economico-and-just-abouteverything-else situation of the Baltimore black<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nMitchell is highly qualified in his<br />\noutspokeness. He has served as Assistant Director<br />\nof the Urban Studies Institute at Morgan State<br />\nand as executive director of the Urban Coalition.<br />\nLast year he ran and lost in a bid for the<br />\nBaltimore 7th District's Congressional seat to<br />\nCongressman Fridell, but remains und: unted and<br />\nplans to run again \"and win this time.\" His<br />\nwarm, outgoing personality seemed to contrast<br />\nwith the grim facts he presented on being black<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\nTen Neanderathals<br />\nCommenting on the City Council, Prof.<br />\nMitchell characterized it as a group of \"ten<br />\nNeanderathals who have the capacity to stifle<br />\nevery piece of liberal legislation that would aid<br />\nblacks\".<br />\nOn discrimination: 'The chance of a Negro<br />\nbuying a house in Baltimore County is nil. The<br />\nSiegfried Line surrounding Baltimore, that is, the<br />\nBeltweay, forms an impregnable barrier beyond<br />\nWhich no black person can live.\"<br />\nAnderson (Executive of Baltimore County)<br />\nwants Baltimore County to be the fastest<br />\ngrowing bastion of descrimination in the<br />\ncountry\".<br />\nBlood-Suckers<br />\nWithin the city, Mitchell said, \"Blacks are<br />\nbeing drained of their life-blood by landlords<br />\nwho suck all the money they can off these<br />\npeople and then flee\". \"The new high-rise<br />\napartments that are being built will only become<br />\ninstant slums.\"<br />\nAnother of his targets is the \"peculiar type of<br />\ngerrymandering used in mapping out political<br />\ndistricts.\" \"The districting of Baltimore is set up<br />\nso as to allow a white man to be elected to a<br /><br />\nCongressional seat in a largely black<br />\ncommunity\".<br />\nProfessor Mitchell continually stressed the<br />\nfact he is very pessimistic concerning any change<br />\nin the status quo, but said \"that if I had the<br />\npower, I would recommend the following<br />\nchanges:<br />\nDo-Nothing Coungress<br />\n\"First I would recommend a complete<br />\nredistricting of Congressional and Council voting<br />\ndistricts in order to prevent the election of<br />\ndo-nothing Congressmen who are advocates of<br />\nvested interests.<br />\n\"I also want changes in the civil service.

Suppose that in<br />\nearlier da s Harvard had lured in<br />\nconsiderable numbers of the sons of<br />\nIrish immigrants who weren't<br />\nacademically qualified for Harvard<br />\n(some were, of course) with enticing<br />\npromises, including great financial aid.<br />\nLong ago Harvard would have had to set<br />\nup an Irish studies program for<br />\nundergraduates, rather than leaving that<br />\nas a Ph.D \u2014 level specialty. It would he<br />\ninteresting to know how valuable such<br />\ndegrees might have been.<br />\nPerhaps the worst aspect of the<br />\nsituation is that, by draining off much<br />\ntop Negro talent into the \"black<br />\nactivist\" field, major universities and<br />\nselective colleges are likely to create<br />\nshortages of Negro professionals such as<br />\ndentists, physicians, lawyers, and<br />\nchemists. If these students had attended<br />\nless-difficult colleges,(and most colleges<br />\nin the United. States are considerallly<br />\nless difficult aCadefhiCally than are<br />\nHopkins, Brandeis, Duke, etc..), they<br />\ncould have chosen freely among<br />\ncurricula there, and succeeded.

Let us<br />\ntrace the logical lines along which the problem is currently being attacked.<br />\nAs everyone knows, Hopkins wants black students to come to the<br />\nuniversity. But as the admissions office will tell you, very few blacks meet<br />\nHopkins educational criteria. The inner city schools are simply not on a<br />\npar with the suburban schools and most inner city students do not receive<br />\nthe training which is required for entrance into Hopkins.<br />\nSuggestions have been made advocating that Hopkins relax its<br />\nadmissions criteria in special cases. But these are met with horror from<br />\nevery quarter. As Dr. Stanley will tell you, it would b psychologically<br />\ndisastrous for students to come and then find that they are not able to<br />\ncompete.<br />\nPeople have proposed that the university offer special courses to<br />\ncorrect the educational disadvantages under which black students find<br />\nthemselves (remedial reading, elementary level mathematics, etc.). But this<br />\nis regarded as virtual heresy. Phrases like \"maintaining high standards of<br />\nacademic excellence\" have an almost religious importance for<br />\nadministrators. And no one would dare to drag the name of Hopkins<br />\nthrough the dust by offerring a math course simpler than calculus. \"It is<br />\nnot our responsibility to correct the deficiencies of the secondary<br />\nschools\", they conclude.<br />\nBy now it is evident that Hopkins is not going to receive applications<br />\nfrom many black students. But as you can see, the university has certainly<br />\ntried. Everyone knows that Hopkins wants black students.<br />\nIs it more damaging for students to find that they cannot compete<br />\nonce they arrive at Hopkins, than to find that they will not be given the<br />\nOpportunity to compete at all? Is Hopkins' reputation more grievously<br />\nstained by offerring lower level courses than by excluding virtually the<br />\nentire black population? And does the responsibility for breaking the<br />\nvicious circle of educational discrepancy in this country fall to politicians<br />\nand other non-educators rather than to the universities? We think not.<br />\nWe believe that the proposal to establish a special tutoring program<br />\nemploying the assistance of graduate students is a good one. That idea,<br />\nproposed by Bob Cotter last spring, is lost somewhere in the bowels of<br />\nHomewood House. It it is revised and properly administered, it could<br />\neliminate the meandering logic described above. It is certainly worth the<br />\neffort.

The most important thing one can do<br />\nWednesday is convince as many people as possible that it is in their best<br />\ninterests to end the war. The people who need to be convinced are those<br />\nwho are not sure about their attitude toward the war.

But<br />\ngoing up to someone on the street, or asking someone why he is going in<br />\nto work that day takes guts. It takes a lot more guts than standing with<br />\n100,000 other people in front of the Pentagon, and it gets a lot more<br />\ndone.<br />\nWhat it takes is students putting themselves out on a limb.

The sign of<br />\nsuccess? Maybe. But if the essence of rock culture has<br />\nbeen successful other than in a commerical sense, the<br />\nresults are far from obvious.<br />\nTwo recent studies which have emerged from the<br />\npens of rock analysts present us with the poles of<br />\ncurrent rock criticism. On the one hand is Arnold<br />\nShaw's The Rock Revolution: What's Happening in<br />\nToday's Music(MacMillan Co., New York, 1969). At the<br />\nother extreme is Nik Cohn and From the Beginning<br />\n(Stein and Day, New York, 1969).<br />\nThey say that you can't judge a book by its cover,<br />\nbut another adage says that there is an exception to<br />\nevery rule. The jackets of these two books tell pretty<br />\nmuch the story of what is inside. The cover of the Shaw<br />\nbook is a plain bluegreen and strongly symbolic: the<br />\nfigure of '69 had rock supported on the shoulders of a<br />\nvast assortment of characters from out of rock 'n roll's<br />\npast. Cohn's book is decorated with a montage of<br />\noranges, greens, blues, and yellows. It is flashy,<br />\nflamboyant, and expects to be considered hip.<br />\nInside is not much different. Nik Cohn is 23, a<br />\nself-styled hippie, and considers himself a \"goof friend\"<br />\nof many rock figures. Okay. Great. But can he write? He<br />\nasserts that his book includes THE sounds, THE groups,<br />\nTHE people, THE technicians, THE managers, etc. of<br />\nthe world of rock. It's all here, baby, between these two<br />\nlittle covers. A frequent contributor to Eve and Cheetah,<br />\nCohn claims to tell us how rock feels, from the point of<br />\nview of a \"lover\" not an \"authority.\" He tries to<br /><br />\nconduct a premature autopsy of the living organism that<br />\nis rock. What actually happens is that he kills the beast.<br />\nThe author gets lost in a muddle of anecdotes and smart<br />\nstories which make rock musicians out as something<br />\nabove the ordinary human being and real<br />\nup-with-the-shirtsleeves workers for the revoltuion.<br />\nActually, Cohn and Shaw should have traded titles.<br />\nFrom the Beginning is a much better title for the latter's<br />\nwork than The Rock Revolution: What's Happening in<br />\nToday's Music. Unlike Cohn, Shaw is just this side of 30<br />\nand a lecturer in music at Dickinson College and The<br />\nJulliard Conservatory. He develops a good professor's<br />\nsurvey course in the history of rock 'n roll and its social<br />\nand cultural manifestation \u2014 a saga of rock \"from the<br />\nbeginning.\" With the archetypal academic approach,<br />\nShaw neatly classifies everyone into a particular<br />\nmainstream of musical topoi and thought; and all are<br />\nbrought together in a terse aesthetic, psychological,<br />\nsocial appreciation of the rock phenomenon. He relates<br />\nthe influence of rock to the Civil Rights Movement, the<br />\n\"youth rebellion,\" and the theater, motion pictures, and<br />\nreligion. Everything fits into the taxonomy of the<br />\nhistory of ideas.<br />\nThese two authors have widely divergent approaches<br />\nto the subject \u2014 Rock \u2014 yet both leave the reader<br />\nfeeling somewhat let down by the whole affair. In the<br />\nend, the pictures which accompany both the texts are<br />\nthe best features of the books. 0! Those pictures of<br />\nElvis!<br />\nWhat perhaps comes closest to understanding the<br />\nstructure of rock music is a collection of essays compiled<br />\nby Jonathan Eisen and entitled Sounds of the American<br /><br />\nCultural Revolution (Random House, New York, 1969).<br />\nMany of the essays center on specific rock personalities,<br />\nbut it is truly interesting to compare an article on Bob<br />\nDylan written in 1964 and one written in 1068. Some of<br />\nthe essays deal with rock in perhaps, its most<br />\nrevolutionary sense - as a prodding for the conventional<br />\ntheater, music, and art, something neither Cohn or Shaw<br />\ntouched on specifically. Robert Cristgau's article \"Rock<br />\nLyrics are Poetry (Maybe)\" is one of the most<br />\nthoughtful in the collection. The author is perceptive<br />\nand has a good command of his material. He is not guilty<br />\nof hero worship nor is he overly cynical or<br />\ncondescending. Cristgau is perceptive and he manages to<br />\nbring some order in his analysis to a situation which has<br />\nrecently become extremely chaotic \u2014 the question of<br />\nrock lyrics say something vs. rock lyrics don't say<br />\nanything. But perhaps the finest and funniest article is<br />\nthe one by Tom Wolfe of Electric Acid Kool Aid Test<br />\nand Pump House Gang fame: In his typically offhand,<br />\nfast paced style, Wolfe treats the rock phenomenon of<br />\nthe groupie and gives the vestal virgins of the rock<br />\nmusicians something to look for \u2014 an identity of their<br />\nown.<br />\nAll in all, though, these three works are<br />\ndisappointing. They are trying to explain a cultural<br />\nphenomenon which is still happening, which is still in<br />\nflux, and probably always will be. An to top it all, they<br />\nhave proceeded to jump on the commerical bandwagon<br />\nand review the goods while they are hot. They fail and it<br />\nis lucky that they do. There are enough distorted and<br />\nmisleading pictures of the rock world circulating around<br />\nalready. But 0! Those pictures of Elvis. They are so<br />\ngreat!<br /><br />\n[Our American Heritage<br /><br />\nMendelsohn: Parker's Political Groupie I<br /><br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nIt may be necessary to preface a<br />\ndiscussion of the 1904 Democractic<br />\nplatform with a justification of<br />\nconsideration of the subject. Many<br />\npeople, especially those who never read<br />\nparty platforms, believe that they are<br />\nunimportant documents. This position<br />\nis not entirely specious. Officers of<br />\ngovernment are obviously entirely free<br />\nto ignore the platform on which they<br />\nwere elected. In some cases, this is<br />\nnecessary for efficacy in administration<br />\nof government. There has never been<br />\nmuch support for the incredible dictates<br />\npolicies which a President can neither<br />\ncompromise nor expand upon.<br />\nPolyglot Party<br />\nNevertheless, the platform has its<br />\nsignificance as the only or principal<br />\nstatement of a national party in<br />\nc nvention assembled. It is<br />\napproximately all on which a polyglot<br />\nparty can agree. Frequently a careful<br />\nreading of a platform is rewarding, not<br />\nas a detailed index to the party's<br />\nprospective course of action, but as<br />\nindicating a general approach to<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nThis is not to say that the platform is<br />\nnot packed with statements which are<br />\nnot to be construed as revelatory. Even<br />\nin the early days of short platforms,<br />\neach document contained certain<br />\nglittering generalities to which even the<br />\nopposition party could not well object.<br />\nHowever, there is often an emphasis on<br />\nlimited government, Presidential<br />\nassertiveness, or some such philosophy<br />\nwhich is of relevance to an<br />\nunderstanding of the organization<br />\nsponsoring the platform.<br />\nThe chief interest in the 1904<br />\nDemocratic platform was the extent to<br />\nwhich the party, now sponsoring Alton<br />\nB. Parker, would repudiate its recent<br />\n(and only interrupted) past under<br />\nWilliam Jennings Bryan. In 1896, when<br />\nBryan forces sized control of the party<br />\nfrom the forces of President Cleveland,<br />\nit was generally believed that the<br />\nplatrorm's repudiation of Cleveland was<br />\nentire and absolute. A result so decisive<br />\nwas not to be anticipated in 1904, for<br />\nthe leaders of the Convention had a<br /><br />\ndistinct fear of Bryan's power.<br />\nSpecifically, it was generally believed<br />\nthat Justice Parker would be dynamited<br />\nif he failed to receive Bryan's<br />\nendorsement. It was also feared that, if<br />\nthe platform were packed with<br />\ninferential repudiations of Bryan, the<br />\nNebraskan's considerable forensic<br />\nability would be applied in behalf of<br />\nconvention dissidents.<br />\nTherefore the platform was drafted<br />\nin close consultation with Bryan, and<br />\ncertain planks were distinctly to his<br />\nliking. An example of this has already<br />\nbeen provided, in the discussion of how<br />\nBryan caused the omission of a plank<br />\nstating that the currency standard was<br />\nno longer a compaign issue.<br />\nThis helps clarify the importance of<br />\nJustice Parker's previously discussed<br />\ntelegram affirming the gold standard.<br />\nThe telegram, cited as the height of<br />\ncourage and honor by the pro-Pakrer<br />\npress, was in fact only a mixed victory.<br />\nIt did demonstrate force on the part of<br />\nParker, but it also antagonized Bryan.<br />\nParker forces entirely vanquished Bryan<br />\nforces in the Convention; nevertheless,<br />\nas we shall see, the campaign would be<br />\ncharacterized by recurring questions of<br />\nthe depth of Bryan's commitment to<br />\nParker.<br />\nNo Position<br />\nPakrer's display of force cannot be<br />\ndeprecated as overly assertive, since<br />\nconcession to Bryan was already<br />\nembodied in the platform. There were<br />\nthree particular progressive planks. One<br />\nwas a simple declaration in favor of<br />\ndirect election of senators, one of the<br />\ncrusades of Bryan. In this as in most<br />\nother public issues, Parker had not<br />\nexpressed a position.<br />\nThe declaration concerning<br />\nimperialism suffers from ambiguity of<br />\nlanguage, but in general it is consonant<br />\nwith the Bryan anti-Imperialism<br />\ncampaign of 1900. It is delcared that all<br />\nAmerican possessions should enjoy the<br />\nfull rights of the mainland; or, to use<br />\nthe phrase of the day, the Constitution<br />\nshoul; follow the flag. Of course the<br />\nSupreme Court Insular Cases decision of<br />\n1902 had allowed considerable latitude<br />\nto colonial administration, but beyond<br /><br />\nperadventure the Democrats adopted a<br />\ntenable position.<br />\nThe platform also advocates that the<br />\nPhilippine, like Cuba, be promised<br />\nindependence upon achieving stability.<br />\nThis is not to be construed as a promise<br />\nof imminent independence, and even<br />\nRepublicans were wont to concede that<br />\nthe Philippines would not be held<br />\nforever. Nevertheless, the suggestion<br />\nthat the Philippines may be as worthy<br />\nof independence as Cuba represents<br />\nsome advance over the position of<br />\nprominent Republicans.<br />\nThe discussion of trusts also owes<br />\nsome thing to Bryan. The moral<br />\nindictment of trusts is the occasion for<br />\nthe most splendid language in the<br />\nplatform. A public monopoly is<br />\nindefensible and intolerable. The<br />\nsuggestions for curbing trusts are not as<br />\nadvanced as would be offered in the<br />\nnext ten years. The Democrats<br />\nadvocated a strenthening of the<br />\nInterstate Commerce Commission.<br />\nAlso, it is suggested that interstate<br />\nmonopolies should not be permitted to<br />\noperate outside the state of their origin.<br />\nIt must be noted that the Republicans<br />\nwere equally willing to issue a general<br />\ncondemantion of monopoly, and their<br />\nown declarations on the subject are not<br />\nentirely optimistic.<br />\nThere is some interest in the tariff<br />\nplank. Twenty years before, the tariff<br />\nwas the principal issue dividing the<br />\nparties. Democrats would style the<br />\nprotective tariff as unconstitutional;<br />\nRepublicans would become rhapsodic<br />\nover the plight of infant industries and<br />\nthe savage threat to national prosperity<br />\nwhich would accompany a reduction in<br />\nrates. Of course there were Democratic<br />\nprotectionists and Republican<br />\nrevisionists, and attention had gradually<br />\nfocused on social issues of greater<br />\nimportance than the tariff.<br />\nThis was the principal educational<br />\nfunction of the Bryan campaign of<br />\n1896. Bryan deliberately relegated the<br />\ntariff to the second rank of campaign<br />\nissues when he thundered, \"Protection<br />\nhas slain its thousands, but the gold<br />\nstandard has slain its tens of<br />\ntIiousands.\"<br /><br />\nOne suspects also that the public ,<br />\nattention span concerning tariff<br />\narguments was limited. During and after 1896, there are several journalistic<br />\nreferences to an earlier period when<br />\nexcitement about the tariff was more<br />\nintense. The significance of the 1904<br />\nplank is that. unlike the famous<br />\nCleveland plank of 1892, it does not<br />\nindict protection as unconstitutional.<br />\nProtection is no longer inherently<br />\nobjectionable, but is objectionalble,<br />\nbecause of its alleged efficacy in<br />\nmothering trusts.<br />\nSince it would be out of character<br />\nfor a Parker platform to promise radical<br />\nchange, we are promised only \"revision<br />\nand gradual reduction.\" This is<br />\nsomewhat in advance of the Republican<br />\nposition.<br />\nMost of the planks are of insufficient<br />\nimportance to receive notation in this<br />\nnecessarily limited discussion. President<br />\nRoosevelt is scalded as a spendthrift,<br />\nand the Democrats advocate a return to<br />\n\"Jeffersonian simplicity of livng.\"<br />\nJefferson introduced the fingerbowl<br />\ninto America, lived in a palatial fashion<br />\nbeyond his means at Monticello, and<br />\nwas not unacquainted with servants and<br />\ncoaches. He did affect simplicity in his<br />\ninitial years in the Presidency, the better<br />\nto draw a contrast with the pieceding<br />\nFederalist presidents. Any reference to<br />\nJeffersonian simplicity is based on<br />\npolitical expediency rather than a<br />\nperceptive study of history.<br />\nThe most arresting part of the<br />\nplatform characterizes the Roosevelt<br />\nadministration as \"spasmodic,<br />\nsensational, spectacular and arbitrary.\"<br />\nThis is a good range of adjectives. There<br />\nare Roosevelt admirers who would<br />\nconede the efficacy of the expression,<br />\nalthough the Democrats desired to<br />\narouse massive hungering for the<br />\nconservatism of Justice Parker.<br />\nIn general, the platform is a<br />\ncompromise between the Cleveland and<br />\nBryan positions. Some pronouncements<br />\nare distinctly progressive; elsewhere it is<br />\nmanifested that the Democrats propose<br />\nan absence of radical change.<br />\nNext week, I shall commence<br />\ndiscussion of the fall campaign.<br /><br />\nII<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nOct. 10, 1969 \u2022 .1<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 11<br /><br />\nSh,rinkology:Ws a Flipped-out Wizard<br />\nBy LIONEL MARKS<br />\nReview the Jack Bruce album, that's<br />\nwhat I am going to do - - right?

This time Brown just<br />\ngives Bruce a chance to use his voice.<br />\nThere are no politico lyrics, none of<br />\nthat message crap, and no \"Cheez my<br />\nbaby done left me so I'm gonna<br />\ncomment o the sad state of the British<br />\neconomy while I find a new one\" songs.<br />\nOn this album, the best of Brown's<br />\nlyrics are close to the music, healthily<br />\nperverse.<br />\nIt's hang the girls and young men<br />\nOn the ropes of tweedy mind<br />\nThe speedy sneaking tongueme.i<br />\nHave left them all behind<br />\nIt's all tripe and no liver<br />\nAt the Cafe of the Neat<br />\nThe cooks jumped in the river<br />\nThe menu smells of feet<br />\nAt worst, Brown's words are<br />\nharmless, letting the music and Bruce's<br />\nvoice come through. That's fine. Good<br />\nlyrics don't hurt, just as soon have<br />\nthem. But the album is Bruce's \u2014 the<br />\ncover says so.<br />\nLead Bass<br />\nThe class cuts on the album have to<br />\nbe \"Never Tell Your Mother She's Out<br />\nof Tune\", \"Theme for an Imaginary<br />\nWestern\", \"Ticket to Waterfalls\" and<br />\n\"To Isengard\". There really is not a bad<br />\ncut, but if you've heard \"As You Said\"<br />\nfrom \"Wheels of Fire\" you've heard<br />\nthree or four of the songs on this album.<br />\nBruce plays acoustic guitar well, but it's<br />\nbeen done before.<br />\n\"Never Tell Your Mother She's Out<br />\nof Tune\", the first cut on the record,<br /><br />\nlets you know what you are going to be<br />\nlistening to for the next ten cuts.<br />\nBruce's bass, Bruce's voice, and<br />\nanything else that he might want to<br />\nthrow in to accompany him. The bass is<br />\nthe lead instrument: it holds the<br />\nmelody, takes the instrumental solos, in<br />\nfact, does everything that you might<br />\nhave expected of a guitar. But listen to<br />\n\"Spoonful\" and you'll see that Bruce<br />\nhas been playing a lead bass for a long<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe bass on the first song is the<br />\nclosest to the way he played with<br />\nCream. It's fast, faster than you can<br />\nbelieve. Not as subtle as some of the<br />\nother cuts but neither is the song. The<br />\ntrumpets and saxes are competent,<br />\nplaying tight-knit arrangements. George<br />\nHarrison, (once again, L'Angelo<br />\nMisterioso) cannot even be heard. No<br />\none complains, its a good song.<br />\nSaage Muskian<br />\nThe second cut, \"Theme for an<br />\nImaginary Western\", is just the sort of<br />\nthing that Bruce fanatics have been<br />\nwaiting for. Bruce is probably the<br />\nbest-trained musician in rock music<br />\n(studied the cello in a Scottish<br />\nconservatory until he was 14) and this<br />\nsong shows some of the discipline.<br />\nUsually a savage musician, he keeps it<br />\ncontrolled here. The progressions are<br />\nthe usual rock changes. Piano dominates<br />\nin this cut and Bruce reveals that he is<br />\ncompetent on that instrument, easily<br />\nmore competent than most of the dudes<br />\nwho are making a living playing<br />\nkeyboards for rock groups.<br /><br />\n\"To Isengard\", one of the last songs<br />\non the album, is probably the biggest<br />\nsurprise. A ballad, in the old English<br />\nstyle, with mystical lyrics? (Isengard,<br />\nhome of Suraman the White, master of<br />\nWormtongue \u2014 one flipped out wizard;<br />\nbig, messy battle with all the Tolkein<br />\ncreatures running in and out.) Take a<br />\nquick look to see if Pete Brown had the<br />\ngood taste with a lot of literary delusion<br />\ncrap. Nope. Just a love song.<br />\nOnce again, Bruce keeps it all<br />\nsubdued. The guitar work, by Bruce,<br />\nSpedding and Pappalardi takes over. For<br />\na moment the bass plays a normal role,<br />\nbut nothing suffers.<br />\nApples and Pears<br />\nI guess everyone has got the idea by<br />\nnow. Jack Bruce's album is a fine one.<br />\nThe bass work and musical knowledge<br />\nthat held Cream together and let Blind<br />\nFaith fall apart, despite all the talent it<br />\nhad, are on this album. But if there is<br />\nanything bad to be said about 'Songsfor<br />\na Tailor' it's this: he needs some<br />\nmusicians of his caliber to play with. If<br />\nyou are not a bass-nut, it might bore<br />\nyou eventually. Even if you are, it<br />\nwould still be nice to hear some other<br />\nsounds.<br />\nSolution: buy Bruce's next album on<br />\nwhich he plays with Larry Coryell,<br />\npossibly the finest and easily the<br />\nleast-known rock guitarist. In the<br />\nmeantime, this album is fine. This has<br />\nbeen nice, but in the wrong direction.<br />\nMusic, words, that's apples and pears.<br />\nJust buy the album.<br /><br />\nVeritas<br /><br />\nFICIassive Breaded 'Chop Engulfs Dormsin Slime I<br />\nBy AHMAD SHEIKHOLISLAM<br />\nSAGA Dormitory Food Service has<br />\ndisplayed a spectrum of culnary quality<br />\nWhich ranges from Saturday night steak<br />\nPlatters down to plates of visual interest<br />\nsuch as the \"breaded pork chop\"<br />\nPictured here.<br />\nThe pictured SAGA presentation was<br />\nPresented to a Hopkins upper classman<br />\non Tuesday, October 7th. The recipient<br />\nand his friends spent a fruitful half-hour<br />\nattempting to express the unique<br />\ncharacteristics of the \"breaded pork<br />\nChop.\" The most precise comparison<br />\nPictured SAGA's \"pork chop\" as, in the<br />\nwords of one present,\"comparable only<br />\nto the semi-masticated chunks of meat<br />\nWhich carnivore mothers have been<br />\nknown to regurgitate in order to feed<br />\ntheir cubs.\"<br />\nThe criticism of the \"breaded pork<br />\nChop\" embraced only its visual aspects<br />\nsince the \"pork chop's\" owner declined<br />\nto eat it.<br />\nAfter several other ideas were<br />\nPresented (not to be given here, as they<br />\nwould be embarrassing to the involved<br />\nFloppies and insulting to SAGA<br />\nsensibilities), Marc Manis, who is<br />\nvice-chairman of the DSRC Food<br />\nCommittee, suggested that the<br />\nunfortunate \"chop\" be publicized.<br />\nManis, with Vincent Price, chairman<br />\nof the Food Committee, and Ahmad<br />\nSheilcholislam, DSRC president, spoke<br />\nwith SAGA administers in order to take<br />\nthe \"chop\" to the Newsletter office.<br />\n.SAGA men expressed<br />\ndisappointment that an exceptionally<br />\nunpleasant-looking entree should be<br />\nPortrayed as the norm. SAGA men also<br />\nexplained that there were three entrees<br />\non Tuesday; the student in question<br />\nnamed his own poison, metaphorically<br /><br />\nspeaking. Why didn't this student take<br />\nthe \"fish\" or \"Cassarole\" entrees?<br />\nThe \"pork chop's\" recipient<br />\nexplained that the fish looked worse<br />\nthan the \"chop\". Haynes Mahoney, a<br />\nJunior, rejected both fish and chops,<br />\nand chose the cassarole. \"It was,\" he<br />\nexplained, \"terrible. My grandfather ate<br />\nbetter (substance) than that at Valley<br />\nForge.\"<br />\nVince Price, as Food Committee<br />\nchairman, explained, \"We do not<br />\nmaintain that average SAGA food is at<br /><br />\nthis low point. But neither will we<br />\nignore the fact that unfortunate meals<br />\noccur at SAGA. At times the food is<br />\nbad. At times, fortunately rare, the food<br />\nis odious. There is a general, though<br />\nsilent, distaste for SAGA among<br />\ndormitory residents. It usually takes the<br />\nform of sardonic humor, but behind<br />\nevery joke is an omelet that fell<br />\nthrough, a cassarole with a vengeance, or<br />\na pork chop such as this.\"<br />\nAsked why he wanted to exhibit the<br />\n\"pork chop,\" Price explained that<br /><br />\n\"Dormitory Residents have no power of<br />\nappeal over SAGA. If SAGA serves<br />\noffensive food, dorm residents are<br />\nforced to eat it. This should impel<br />\nSAGA to make every effort to please<br />\nstudents. Usually students are, if not<br />\npleased, at least satisfied. But if SAGA<br />\nfalls through, what can the average<br />\nstudent do? Last year the average<br />\nstudents got together and staged a food<br />\nriot. This year violent upheavals of<br />\nSAGA food by dorm residents will<br />\nresult in strict disciplinary action. We<br />\nlose all around.\"<br />\nDSRC president Ahmad<br />\nSheikholislam called for \"an immediate<br />\nimprovement in the Snack Bar and the<br />\nDining Room service.\" SAGA runs<br />\nboth.<br />\nPrice added, \"Right now, to live in<br />\nthe dorms, a student is automatically<br />\nforced to stomach SAGA at a cost of<br />\n$525. Why not separate room from<br />\nboard making SAGA service optional?\"<br />\nIf students have complaints<br />\nconcerning food service, they should<br />\ncontact either Price in 203 Vincent, or<br />\nMarc Manis in 303 Vincent. It is also<br />\npossible to complain via House<br />\nPresidents, or by dropping a complaint<br />\nin Box 2062. Membership in the DSRC<br />\nFood Committee is open to all dorm<br />\nresidents; those interested should<br />\ncontact Price.<br />\nSAGA men declared that if any<br />\nentree should be the object of general<br />\ncriticism by dorm residents, the recipe<br />\nwould be thrown out and the entree<br />\nnever again served. SAGA explains that<br />\nit attempts to work for and with dorm<br />\nresidents; they are responsive to the<br />\ndesires of the students.<br />\nOn the other hand, a resigned senior,<br />\nviewing the Tuesday mail, commented<br />\nwryly that \"Hopkins eats shit.\"<br />\nCORRECTION....<br />\nIn last week's issue we omitted the<br />\nby-line for the Veritas column. The<br />\narticle was written by Marshall Kapp.<br /><br />\nOct. 10, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 12<br /><br />\n-features<br />\nWhen Can Murder Not Be Homicide?<br />\nBy MICHAEL BRENSON<br />\nWith terrible eloquence, the case of the Green Berets<br />\nhas told us that after stretching and stretching the limits<br />\nof human decency, we have finally broken through and<br />\nhave begun to play with evil. Granted that this war has<br />\nbred many incidents like it. The fact is that never has<br />\nsuch behavior been so openly condoned by those who<br />\ncontrol this country.<br />\nOn Tuesday, October 1, we were informed that the<br />\nGreen Berets accused of murdering a Vietnamese had<br />\nbeen freed. There would be no trial. It was a matter of<br />\nnational security. And how could they be judged by<br />\nthose who were putting them on trial?<br />\nBarry Sadler<br />\nAfter the Green Berets had been released, it was<br />\nrevealed that they had some friends in Congress who had<br />\nbeen urging the Pentagon to drop the case. Senator<br />\nThurmond \u2014 \"I was confident the Nixon Administration<br />\nwould not prosecute these men as such action is not in<br />\nthe nature of the President and Defense Secretary<br />\nLaird.\" Mendel Rivers pledged that the accused men<br />\nwould be restored to duty with clean records. \"Take it<br />\nfrom me, we will see to it, for you and the American<br />\npeople, that their records will be clean.\" Thurmond<br />\nunderstood perfectly the \"nature\" of Nixon and Laird.<br />\nThe case was dropped.<br />\nAfter his release Colonel Rheault, he of the Barry<br />\nSadlers and Robin Moores and John Waynes, said \u2014 \"I<br />\ndon't think you can make the terminology homicide.<br />\nWar is a difficult and dangerous business. People get<br />\nkilled in war. This is not to be considered homocide.\"<br />\nBernard Fall<br />\nIf it is not homocide, i.e. murder, then what is it? If it<br />\nis not homocide, then neither was Dachau and<br />\nBuchenwald. If it is not homocide, then anything is<br />\npossible. When this is condoned by the people who<br />\ncontrol us, when it is clear that these people haven't the<br />\ncapacity to feel, only to manipulate and posture, then<br />\nthere is no scale of evil that is beyond us.<br />\nThe incident reminded me of several days spent with<br />\nan American Foreign Service officer who had spent<br />\nmany years in Vietnam. He spoke of the frequency with<br />\nwhich Americans simply shot or had removed many of<br /><br />\nthose who went against them. He went on to speak<br />\nabout a fellow foreign service officer who had been<br />\nordered by the military to have Bernard Fall<br />\n\"eliminated.\" The officers resigned. A couple of days<br />\nlater, it was reported that Fall had stepped on a mine,<br />\n\"There is no way you could prove it, but I'm sure they<br />\nkilled him.\"<br />\nThe question of whether or not the slain man was or<br />\nwas not a double agent, or whether or not Fall was<br />\nmurdered is in the end irrelevant. Murder over there is a<br />\nfact of life. As with other countries who have found<br />\nhuman life something less than sacred in this century,<br />\nmurder is always something else. Whatever it is, it has a<br />\nnoble purpose, and it is not homocide.<br />\nWe are left with the words of Pham Kim Lien, the<br />\nwife of the slain man \u2014 \"the soul of my husband will<br /><br />\nfollow those who killed him.\" It is a primitive curse, but<br />\nit is on us, not on the men who killed him.<br />\nWhere He Stands<br />\nThere is no purpose here in discussing how much this<br />\ndirty war has corrupted this country and distorted<br />\nhuman values. Too many know this. The (,ase of the<br />\nGreen Berets is one more instance where the President<br />\nhas clearly let us know where he stands. The day after<br />\nthe Green Berets were released, he cut 42% off aid to the<br />\ncities.<br />\nThere are those who wished for Nixon's election<br />\nbecause they felt his mentality would bring the conflicts<br />\nof this country to a head. They felt he would make his<br />\nposition clear, thus making it possible, if not mandatory,<br />\nto react against him. It seems to me that we are at that<br />\npoint.<br /><br />\nBridge<br /><br />\nWatch the Bidding!<br />\n\u2014<br />\nV CI 94O A #42<br />\n+ Akca64-3<br /><br />\n4:S<br /><br />\nAxG53<br />\nV KS 86<br /><br />\n+10<br />\n+J.987<br /><br />\neN 94<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\n1<br />\nW<br /><br />\nE<br /><br />\n\u2022lo 7 5<br />\nO K GJ 9853<br />\n4'10<br /><br />\ne&gt; A KO lo 8 72<br />\n\u2713 A 32<br />\n+6<br />\n4. 52<br />\nIt is very important in bridge to pay close attention<br />\nto the opponent's bidding.

Bruce Leslie<br />\nDAY OF CONSCIENCE<br />\nTo the Hopkins Community:<br />\nIn the past few weeks there<br />\nhas been much controversy<br />\nconcerning the National<br /><br />\nVietnam Moratorium on<br />\nOctober 15th. On campus, the<br />\ntwo main questions concern the<br />\nappropriateness and<br />\neffectiveness of the moratorium.<br />\nPeople have argued that the<br />\nmoratorium is a misdirected<br />\nat tack detrimental to the<br />\nstudent's best interests and an<br />\nineffective method of changing<br />\ngovernment policy. These<br />\narguments against the<br />\nmoratorium are wrong.<br />\nOctober 15th is a day for all<br />\npeople of conscience to put<br />\naside their everyday business and<br />\nwork for peace by opposing the<br />\ngovernment's policy and calling<br />\nfor an immediate American<br />\ntroop withdrawal. The student<br />\nwill not be hurt by refraining<br />\nfrom classes. The conventional<br />\neducation forfeited will be<br />\namply replaced by education<br />\nand national policy discussion<br />\nduring the moratorium. More<br />\nimportantly, however, the<br />\nVietnam war is not in the best<br />\ninterest of the country either<br />\npolitically, socially or<br />\neconomically, and since the<br /><br />\nstudent is a part of this country,<br />\nit could not be in his best<br />\ninterest either.<br />\nThe moratorium strategy has<br />\nnever been attempted before and<br />\ntherefore it could not possibly<br />\nbe known whether it is an<br />\neffective means of changing<br />\ngovernment policy. The strategy<br />\ncalls for a sustained effort<br />\ntowards building a broad-based<br />\npolitical movement to end the<br />\nwar. Protest against the war will<br />\nbe concentrated in a moratroium<br />\non \"business as usual\" for one<br />\nday in October, two days in<br />\nNovember, three in December,<br />\nand continuing in this pattern<br />\nuntil the war is over.<br />\nThe moratorium puts its faith<br />\nin the people of this country. It<br />\nasks for a simple committment<br />\nfrom the people in order to end<br />\na senseless, immoral war. One<br />\ncannot be sincerely opposed to<br />\nthe war and at the same time,<br />\nnot be willing to make this<br />\ncommittment.

Mark Reutter, for<br />\nhandling the technically difficult<br />\nand emotionally sensitive<br />\nmaterial surrounding the Jensen<br />\nreport so well. It was<br />\nparticularly astute journalism to<br />\npoint out who had read the<br />\nreport before entring opinions<br />\nand who had not read it. I would<br />\nalso like to correct one small<br />\nmatter. I said that Hopkins<br />\ncould expect to have about a<br />\ntwo per cent black student<br />\nbody, not \"faculty,\" as the<br />\narticle indicated. The<br />\nlower-bound for Hopkins'<br />\nfaculty SAT scores is very likely<br />\nat least 100 points higher than<br />\nthe lower-bound for students.<br />\n(In general, it is desirable not to<br />\nhave teachers be less able than<br />\nstudents.) This would be<br />\nbetween one and two standard<br />\ndeviations higher still on the<br />\nblack distribution, and the<br />\nproportion of blacks scoring at<br />\nthat level or higher would be<br />\nmuch less than two per cent of<br />\nthe black high school graduates:<br />\nin fact, it would be between nine<br />\nin thirty thousand and one in<br />\nthirty thousand. (In contrast,<br />\nfifteen out of every hundred<br />\nwhites who take the SAT, score<br />\nat that level or higher.) Since<br />\nblacks graduate from high school<br />\nat a lower rate than whites, my<br />\ntwo per cent estimate for this<br />\nstudent body was itself a bit too<br />\nhigh, probably by a factor of<br />\nabout 25 per cent. This would<br />\nindicate that Hopkins is doing<br />\nquite well in having two per cent<br />\nblacks amongst its entering<br />\nfreshmen. The problem of<br />\nfinding black professors is also<br />\nhighlighted by these figures.<br />\nThe relative availablity of<br />\nhighly able blacks to serve as<br />\nHopkins faculty would also<br />\ndepend on their occupational<br />\npreferences. It is not<br />\nunreasonable to suppose that<br />\nhighly able blacks might accord<br />\nhigher priority to occupations<br />\nother than that of professor. Of<br />\nthose who choose to be<br />\nprofessors, some remain at<br />\nNegro institutions they are<br />\nunwilling to desert. while others<br />\nare already at predominantly<br />\nwhite institutions, and it is not<br />\nclear whose purpose might be<br />\nserved by shifting them from<br />\none to antoher of these<br />\nuniversities. It is one thing to<br />\nissue emotional appells for<br />\nhiring black faculty that win<br />\nfavor with the studi.nt body and<br />\nplace the University in a bad<br />\nlight, and anotliei to try to<br />\neducate students so that they<br /><br />\ncomprehend the true magnitude<br />\nof the problem.<br />\nRobert A. Gordon<br />\nAssociate Professor<br />\nDepartment of Social Relations<br />\nJENSEN ANALYSIS<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am a graduate student<br />\nworking oil a full-time basis in<br />\nthe area of human gentics.<br />\nAlthough I do not claim to be an<br />\nexpert on the subject of racial<br />\ndifferences in intelligence, many<br />\npeople on campus have asked me<br />\nin recent months to discuss the<br />\ntheory brought forth by Dr.<br />\nArthur Jensen to the effect that<br />\nU.S. Negroes perform at a lower<br />\nwhites on<br />\nlevel than<br />\nstandardized IQ tests because of<br />\ngenetic factors. What follows<br />\nhere is my attempt to analyze<br />\nsome of the arguments behind<br />\nthis view in as scientific a<br />\nmanner as possible.<br />\nRaces are biological<br />\npopulations differing in the<br />\nfrequencies of certain genes. An<br />\nAfrican may be less or more<br />\nlikely than a Swede to have a<br />\ncertain blood type, by the Type<br />\n0 African resembles the Type 0<br />\nSwede with respect to this gene<br />\nmore han he resembles a fellow<br />\nAfrican of a different blood<br />\ntype. If there are hereditary<br />\nfactors influencing IQ score or<br />\nintelligence, it is likely that races<br />\nwould differ in the frequencies<br />\nof the factors. It is, however,<br />\nunlikely that many factors<br />\nwuuld be present in one race and<br />\nabsent in another race.<br />\nFurthermore, the group known<br />\nas \"Negroes\" in the U.S. is really<br />\na mixed race of African and<br />\nEttiopean descent. Estimates of<br />\nthe European contribution<br />\ngenerally iange around the<br />\ntwenty percent figure.<br />\nThus, before a piofessional<br />\nge ietic:st would like to make a<br />\nconclusion about race<br />\ndifferences in intelligence, he<br />\nwould probably wish to have<br />\nsome biochemical evidence as to<br />\nwhat factors were responsible<br />\nfor intelligence and their<br />\ndistribution over the races of<br />\nmankind.<br />\nAccording to Montague,<br />\nstudies exist which show that<br />\nNegroes and othei groups living<br />\nin extremely poor condictions<br />\ntend to experience a marked<br />\nupward shift in IQ when their<br />\nsurr oundings are drastically<br />\nimproved. The Osage Indians,<br />\nfor example, had a 20-point shift<br />\nin the mean IQ score shortly<br />\nafter oil was discovered on their<br />\nreservation and a consequent<br />\nimprovement in education was<br />\nmade.<br />\nThe most hazardous<br />\nconclusion to be drawn fi om the<br />\n\"Jensen report\" is that Negroes<br />\nbe taught skills requiring a low<br />\ndegree of abstract intelligence.<br />\nmight wonder whether the<br />\nOne<br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nwriter would advocate a<br />\nService<br />\nsugar-free diet for diabetics.<br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT Aside from humanitarian<br />\nconsiderations, these courses of<br />\n3330 GREENMOUNTAVE action are not acceptable as<br />\n467-2123<br />\nprofessional recommendations in<br />\nthe field of human genetics.<br />\nGeneticists realize that all are<br />\n\u2014 WHAT EXACTLY does the Nixon<br />\nnot created equal in every<br />\nAdministration think about busing?

The graduate<br />\ncommittee then selected ten graduate<br />\nstudents to tutor the prospective<br />\nentrants.<br />\nOn August 4, however, Cotter said.<br />\nall thyprevious plans fell through. \"Dr.<br />\nStanley (professor of education and<br />\npsychology) appeared and the<br />\ndiscussion centered on whether there<br />\nshould be a gap between black and<br />\nwhite students instead of looking into<br />\nthe gaps and trying to overcome them,\"<br />\nstated Cotter. \"Stanley kept on saying<br />\nthat people with educational gaps<br />\nshouldn't come to Hopkins and Kimball<br />\njust sat there and didn't open his<br />\nmouth. In desperation I called for a<br />\nsmaller meeting.\"<br />\nDead End<br />\nAt that meeting two weeks later, Mr.<br />\nRonald Owen, the new recently<br />\nappointed assistant director of<br />\nadmissions, announced that Brinkley<br />\nhad sa..1 admissions were closed and the<br />\nstudents Cotter selected would under no<br />\ncircumstances be accepted.<br />\n\"I learned a lot from this and I made<br />\na lot of mistakes. I tried to use proper<br />\nchannels and I got channeled<br />\nsuccessively away from the policy<br />\nmaking people here,\" Cotter declared.<br /><br />\n\"There was no intention of taking them<br />\n(the disadvantaged students) in here<br />\neven though they (the administrators)<br />\nalways expressed their interest for more<br />\nblack students.\"<br />\nThe administrators involved refuted<br />\nCotter's allegations. Dean Kimball<br />\nclaimed that he never made a promise of<br />\ntutorial help. \"It is my opinion and the<br />\nopinion of many others including black<br />\nstudents on camps and the Negro<br />\npeople in the community that tutoring<br />\nis not a suitable program for Hopkins.<br />\nThis is not because of our interests,\" the<br />\nliberal arts dean contended, \"but<br />\nbecause of the interests of the students<br />\ninvolved. The University should not<br />\nmislead students here ... Why? It just<br />\ncan't be done with their background, I<br />\ndon't know the technicalities; talk to<br />\nothers about the actual statistics, but I<br />\nknow that they were in the range of<br />\n300-250 in their SAT's.\"<br />\n(Cotter's figures show that only one<br />\nof the five students who took the SAT<br />\nscored below 300. One student received<br />\nscores 657 verbal and 591 math and the<br />\nlowest academic average of the high<br />\nschoolers was 79.6).<br /><br />\nformalized tutoring has serious<br />\ndisadvantages for the student. \"It's one<br />\nthing to be enthusiastic about bringing<br />\nstudents here and another being<br />\nenthusiastic over individual students.Swanson maintained. \"Tutoring<br />\nstudents for four years so that they can<br />\nget a degree here is wrong. They would<br />\nthen get second class treatment. If they<br />\nare continually required to bc tutored,<br />\nthen they would never feel a part of this<br />\nplace.In the admissions department.<br />\nRonald Owen was unimpressed with<br />\nCotter's attempts to increase black<br />\nenrollment at Homewood. \"Bob has<br />\nperpetrated a very difficult situation. He<br />\ninsisted that even if only three or four<br />\nof the thirteen students made it here<br />\nthat this would prove something. His<br />\nfirst consideration was not for the kids,<br />\nbut to prove a point which I'm not sure<br />\nof even now,\" Owen remarked. \"The<br />\nstudents hadn't taken their SAT's, we<br />\ndidn't have their complete records and<br />\nall the financial aid was gone. Bob<br />\nmerely found the kids and wanted<br />\nsomebody else to take it all over.\"<br />\nInsult to Intelligence<br /><br />\n\"We are enthusiastic about their (the<br />\ngraduate committee's) work in placing<br />\nblacks in other colleges,\" Kimball<br />\nstated. This sentiment was echoed by<br />\nDean Swanson, who believed that<br /><br />\nHold your own.<br />\nCool idea for boat, beach, barbecue, ballpark.

Special remedial<br />\nn insul: to their<br />\nprograms are<br />\nin telli ge n ce.- Owen asserted. He<br />\nmentioned Darmouth College as a place<br />\nni<br />\nwhere many blacks have been admitied<br />\nand consequently remedial reading and<br />\nhigh school math courses have been<br />\nadded to Darmouth's curricula. \"This<br />\nwe don't want,- said Owen.<br />\nDr. Julian Stanley, a member of<br />\nHopkins' Linde,graduate Admissions<br />\nCommittee. is the intellectual-in-i-esidence for the admissions department. \"I<br />\nstudy the academic differences between<br />\nblack and white students,\" he stated.<br />\nStanley alamantly opposed the idea that<br />\nthe university accept \"academically<br />\nunderqualified students and then ...<br />\nchange itself to accomodate them.\"<br />\nAlready, he noted, \"We at Hopkins<br />\nare being rather lenient in admitting<br />\ncertain black freshmen.\" Only one to<br />\ntwo per cent of the black students are<br />\nqualified for schools of Hopkins'<br />\nstature, Stanley asserted. A proposal<br />\nthat Hopkins embark on a summer<br />\nprogram for selected disadvantaged<br />\nstudents will be made in the next few<br />\nweeks by Dr. Stanley.

Wilson Shaffer completed plans to do<br />\naway with admissions charges to university sporting events<br />\nand the policy of trading guarantees with other schools. It<br />\nwas a Noble Experiment, \"unique among American<br />\nColleges.\" The intention of this policy change was to draw<br />\na clear distinction between the use of college football and.<br />\nathletics for public amusement and college recreation.<br />\nUnder Shaffer's expanded intercollegiate (from 6 sports to<br />\n13), intramural, and physical education program initiated<br />\nin 1934, 92 per cent of Hopkins undergraduates were<br />\ninvolved as compared to 15 per cent under the old system.<br /><br />\nIn the opening game on Tuesday, the<br />\nHopkins varsity soccer team put on a<br />\ntremendous show by crushing the<br />\nUniversity of Delaware, 4-1.<br /><br />\nHopkins won the toss and after one brief<br />\nat each side of the field, the Jays turned<br />\nflurry<br />\nBut now thirty-two years later we of Hopkins find our alma<br />\non<br />\nthe<br />\nspeed and scored at :55 of the opening<br />\nnecessity.<br />\nmater renewing the admissions charge due to financial<br />\nperiod.<br />\nWenker, taking a.perfect pass from<br />\nBernie<br />\nAlthough no lodger directly related to the athletic program, gate<br />\nRon aOWes,\"16op'ed the ball over thdheact of the<br />\nthe<br />\nfrom<br />\nwhich<br />\nfund<br />\nreceipts still go into the same general university<br />\nstartled U. 41-, Delaware goalie.

Professors, their<br />\nThe reasoning is that if the professors had to pay many of them<br />\nwouldn't come and it was felt that as much encouragement as<br />\npossible should be employed if we wanted to involve the faculty in<br />\nthe non-academic parts of the university. We see nothing wrong with<br />\nthis side of the policy.<br />\nBut then why in the same sense of encouragement must students<br />\npay for their wives or dates? Admittedly we are a much larger<br />\nproportion of the potential attendance and the university is out to<br />\nmake money through admission charges which they would be<br />\ndeprived of if dates were allowed in free. The present reduction of<br />\nfifty cents dues not offset the inequity of this situation. In response,<br />\nMr. Bilgrave has said that he knows of no college in America that<br />\nallows dates in for free. Must the uniqueness of Hopkins be so<br />\nsubject to the tyranny of the almighty dollar and the mediocrity of<br />\nconformity?<br />\nWe ask Mr. Bilgrave to review the situation and come up with a<br />\nmore equitable solution for both the students and the faculty.<br />\nFurther reduction in the price for a date or abolition of this charge<br />\naltogether should be considered seriously.<br />\nIt has been estimated that the admissions charge will bring from<br />\nbetween $20 and $40 thousand dollars in additional revenue to the<br />\nuniversity's coffers. After the Muhlenberg game, we wonder if such<br />\nestimates are not too high. The net take for the Muhlenberg game<br />\nwas $734.50. Naturally, the big money gainers will come in the<br />\nspring with lacrosse and possibly with some late season football<br />\ngames if past attendance trends are accurate and continue despite<br />\nthe admissions charge.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Bilgrave, \"The university is hurting for money<br />\nand this is another source of income.\" In commending Hopkins'<br />\nelimination of gate charges on March 2, 1937, C.M.

Hopkins'had a scoring chance at the<br />\nsix minute mark when Lemmon got called for<br />\nhands outside the goal circle giving the Jays a<br />\npenalty kick. The shot was deflected and there<br />\nwas no further scoring until 17:34 when<br />\nLemmon, coming out to take a Hopkins shot,<br />\nmissed it, leaving a free ball and an open net. A<br />\nhead shot missed and the scoring opportunity<br />\nwas finally cashed in when Scott Tyner put it in<br />\nwith an assist going to Ron Rowes. On the play,<br />\ngoalie Lemmon was kicked in the head and had<br />\nto be replaced by Joe Owsley. Delaware finally<br />\nfound some spark and came right back downfield<br />\npressuring goalie Weiss very hard. When Hopkins<br />\ngot called for hands inside the penalty circle,<br />\nDelaware was awarded a penalty shot which Mike<br />\nBiggs converted with a solid boot into the right<br />\ncorner for a Delaware score. Weiss had no chance<br />\nto block the well-placed shot. The half ended<br />\nwith Hopkins holding a 3-1 lead.<br />\nSit On Lead<br />\nWhen the third quarter opened, it seemed like<br />\na different Hopkins soccer team was out there.<br />\nThe playing was sloppy and lackadaisical,<br />\nresulting perhaps from Hopkins' attempt to sit<br />\non their lead. At first, Delaware was unable to<br />\ntake advantage but then they started to put<br />\nheavy pressure on Weiss, who was up to the task<br />\nand was able to successfully withstand the<br />\nDelaware charege. Suddenly, Wenker got the ball,<br />\ndribbled by his man, passed the ball to Szeles<br />\nwho attempted a shot which missed, the ball<br />\ngoing to Ron Rowes, who seemed to be<br />\neverywhere. Ron promptly drilled the ball home,<br />\nSzeles assisting. The time of the goal was 15:21.<br />\nThe goal seemed to wake up the slumbering Jays,<br />\nwho then reversed their previous form and<br />\ncompletely dominated the rest of the game.

The game was a departure from<br />\nthe classic confrontation and both teams seemed<br />\ndetermined to give the game away until, with a<br />\nfew minutes to go, a Hopkins fumble near the<br />\nF&amp;M goal line followed by an F&amp;M fumble lead<br />\nto the final score.<br />\nTwo standouts were Dave Pickall at wide receiver and<br />\nJohn Diorio on the line possibly because they were two<br />\nof the few players who could do anything right). If the<br />\nFranklin and Marshall team had not matched us fumble<br />\nfor fumble we probably would not have come away the<br />\nvictors.<br />\nHopkins enjoyed limited success in the air as<br />\nquarterback Bob Pfeifer hit Pickall on a down and out<br />\npattern to make the initial score. Pfeifer was noticably<br />\nPoorer than he was against Muhlenberg as was shown by<br />\nhis four interceptions.<br />\nF&amp;M Picks Off Fumble<br />\nThe F&amp;M offense faltered when they first received<br />\nthe ball and on the ensuing punt Hopkins had possession<br />\nonce again. Here starts the real story of the game as<br />\nconfusion in the backfield was evident when a pitchout<br />\nwent into the waiting hands of an F&amp;M lineman. It took<br />\nfour plays to put F&amp;M ahead, 7 to 6.<br />\nIn the second period, Hopkins had their first<br />\noPportunity to watch the comedy from the better side<br />\nas a Diplomat punt sailed thirty yards straight up into<br />\nthe air and the Jays got the ball on the F&amp;M<br />\ntwenty-eight yard line. There followed among other<br /><br />\nthings a fifteen yard penalty against the Jays anu a<br />\nPfeifer to Pickall pass that took the ball to the nineteen.<br />\nThen on a long post pattern, Pickall cuaght his second<br />\ntouchdown pass of the day. A faked kick led to another<br />\nPickall reception for the two-point conversion.<br />\nAnother specialty by the offensive unit (a lateral to<br />\nthe other team) set up the final score of the first half to<br />\nmake it Hopkins 14, F&amp;M 13.<br />\nIn the third period the Franklin and Marshall team<br />\nhad the Jays completely outclassed. An interception of a<br />\nPfeifer pass led to a Diplomat score in that period. The<br />\nloss of Charlie (C.C.) Coker was quite evident at this<br />\npoint as the defense (to say the least) sagged. The last<br />\nscore of the period was a thirty-yard field goal by<br />\nDiplomat kicker, John Burnetti. This put us on the short<br />\nend of a 23.to 14 score.<br />\nMistakes Costly<br />\nTwo costly F&amp;M mistakes in the fourth quarter gave<br />\nthe lead back to Hopkins. The first, a fumble by the<br />\nDiplomats on the Hopkins 34, led to the third<br />\ntouchdown pass from Pfeifer to Packall. The second, a<br />\npoor snap from center, led many onlookers to think the<br />\nDiplomats did not want to win after all. Getting the ball<br />\non the F&amp;M seven, Steve Hata ran in for the score. Yet<br />\non the next kickoff, the Diplomats marched thirty-nine<br />\nyards downfield for a touchdown and the lead, 29-26.<br />\nThe Jays next drive was ended by an interception but<br />\nthey got the ball back with three minutes to go. They<br />\ndrove to the Franklin and Marshall four before handing<br />\nthe ball over to the Diplomats on a fumble with a<br />\nminute remaining.<br /><br />\n13EARS<br /><br />\nBut on the first play the Diplomat quarterback Sam<br />\nLong fumbled back to the Jays' Norm Gross. Pfeifer<br />\nthen passed to end Steve Latson to give the Jays the win<br />\nand end an otherwise perfect(?) day.

The squad had a lot of<br />\npotential, a willingness to work hard in<br />\norder to perfect itself, and great depth.<br />\nThe defense is definitely the most<br />\nstable and strongest point of the team<br />\nthis year. It is led by Goalie Bob<br />\nLarossa, and fullbacks, Duane Mangimi<br />\nand Jim Johnson, generally<br />\nacknowledged as the leader of the team.<br />\nIn two scrimmages so far against Gilman<br />\nHigh and Pomoei High School, the<br />\ndefense allowed one goal and two goals<br />\nrespectively. Furthermore, in<br />\nscrimmages against the Varsity, the<br />\nfreshmen have cut the scores down from<br />\n4-Ito either 2-1 or 1-0.<br />\nThe offense, of course, must be<br />\nstrong too in order to have a truly<br />\nsuccessful season. This part of the team<br />\nis led by Halfbacks John Fogarty, Harry<br />\nFurukawa, and Andy Smith, all of<br />\nwhom are good dribblers and great<br />\nplaymakers. These three also help<br />\ncharacterize the strong defensive play of<br />\nthe team, with their ability-tasteal, the<br /><br />\nball and set up good passes.<br />\nThe offensive line, nevertheless, is<br />\nrather unstable yet, due to the<br />\nexperimentation of Coach Savage during<br />\nthe two scrimmages. The most probably<br />\nlineup, though, puts Marc Heller and<br />\nChuck Robinson at the wing positions,<br />\nMark Manzione and Jeff Hamelman at<br />\nthe insides, and either Ljubomir Nacev<br />\nor Medil Waldt at the center forward<br />\nspot. Despite changes in these positions,<br />\nthe offense has still been able to put in<br />\nfive goals during the first two<br />\nscrimmages. Thus, once the line is<br />\nstablized, its drives could be very<br />\ndifficult to stop.<br />\nThough the team currently has very<br />\nfew injuries, depth is one of the main<br />\nfactors of team strength emphasized by<br />\nCoach Savage. The second team, led by<br />\nlinemen, Ed Koza and Gary Shayne,<br />\nHalfbacks Frank Roediger and Steve<br />\nBuckingham, and Fullback Jeff Epstein,<br />\nhave jsut as much ability and strength as<br />\nthe first team.<br />\nThe squad has its first test on<br />\nOctober 9th, when it battles Mt. St.<br />\nJoseph, although the hardest contest<br />\nappears to be that against the Navy<br />\n.Rlebes,.t.hes last game.. of. the season<br /><br />\nPAGE 20<br /><br />\nOct. 10, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nMoratorium Head Builds a Movement<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nOn Vermont Avenue in Washington<br />\nit is night and the lights are on in the<br />\noffices of the Vietnam Moratorium<br />\nCommittee. inside, some college<br />\nstudents are typing and stuffing<br />\nenvelopes, while others pause for a<br />\nmoment sipping coffee. These bare<br />\noffices are the headquarters for the<br />\nOctober 15 moratorium, and the goal is<br />\nto get the United States out of Vietnam.<br />\nIn order to do this, the largest, broadest<br />\nanitwar movement this country has ever<br />\nseen must be assembled. Building this<br />\ncoalition is the awesome task of a thin,<br />\nex-Harvard Divinity student, Sam<br />\nBrown.<br />\nSam Brown has<br />\nbeen working for a<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nlong time to get the<br />\nNEWS<br />\nU.S. out of Southeast<br />\nAsia. He has picketed<br />\nFEATURE<br />\nand marched like<br />\nmany other people,<br />\nbut he was also the chief organizers of<br />\nSen. Eugene McCarthy's Youth<br />\nCampaign, which saw thousands and<br />\nthousands of students bring the issue of<br />\nthe war to the people. The primary<br />\nvictories that McCarthy won could have<br />\nmore eaily been credited to Brown's<br />\norganizational ability than to the<br /><br />\npersonal appeal oi McCarthy. Peace was<br />\nthe biggest loser at the Chicago<br />\nconvention, as Humphrey rode in on a<br />\nbarrage of clubbings and beatings.<br />\nBrown, however, has not given up, and<br />\nis presently building a nationwide<br />\nmovement that is quickly gathering<br />\nmomentum, fueled by the endorsements<br />\nof such people as Sen. George<br />\nMcGovern, John Kenneth Galbraith,<br />\nBenjamin Spock, and Richard Goodwin.<br />\nSam Brown's looks are decieving. He<br />\nis soft-spoken and has a droopy<br />\nmustache and longish hair that make<br />\nhim virtually indistinguishable from<br />\ncountless other people walking around<br />\ncollege campuses.<br />\nNixon Fraud<br />\nFor the many people who are tired<br />\nof protesting and seeing little results,<br />\nBrown has the answer. \"The war<br />\ncontinues and we just have to work.<br />\nEven though you can't guarantee<br />\nsuccess, the kind of tactic we're<br />\npursuing is the one that's most likely to<br />\nend the war and that's why people<br />\nought to do it, because I assume they<br />\nwant the war over.\"<br />\nStill others think that since Nixon is<br />\ncutting the troops and we're at the<br />\npeace table, the war will soon be over.<br />\nBrown is rather cynical about Nixon's<br />\nwillingness to get us out of Vietnam,<br /><br />\nand not pull his punches. \"All that stuff<br />\nis nonsense. Starting with the troop<br />\nwithdrawls, you'll see what I mean.<br />\nNixon only withdrew to the level which<br />\nJohnson set over a year ago, the level<br />\nwhere fighting can continue without<br />\nserious impairment, with 60,000 troops<br />\nwithdrawn In short, he hasn't cut in<br />\nany way into the effective fighting<br />\ncapacity in Vietnam. There are only<br />\n85,000 men in the field at any given<br />\nsingle time, and the casualty level<br />\nremains comparably high.\"<br />\n\"The draft call, of course, is an even<br />\ngreater fraud because a year ago the<br />\nit-aft call was almost 296,000 men. This<br />\nyear, by his so-called \"cut\" of 50,000<br />\nmen we have a draft call of 290,000.<br />\nPrimarily, this is because the draft calls<br />\nhave been up the last five months, and<br />\nso he then announces this big gesture,<br />\nthe net consequences of which are<br />\npractically nothing.\"<br />\n\"I<br />\nadded,<br />\nsee<br />\nno<br />\nHe<br />\nindication that Nixon has any interest in<br />\nmoving faster than he's now moving.<br />\nPeople continue to die in Vietnam. Over<br />\n2,000 have died since he announced<br />\nwe're going to start withdrawing. I see<br />\nno reason why we should continue at<br />\nthis pace, with another ten or fifteen<br />\nthousand dead before we get out. We<br />\nsimply ought to get up, and get out. To<br />\ndo this, we have an obligation now to<br /><br />\nbegin to build a broad-based antiwar<br />\nmovement in the country.\"<br />\nOne of the key aspects of the<br />\nmovement is the spreading uf antiwar<br />\nsentiment outsine the academic<br />\ncomniunity. Brown hopes that large<br />\nnumbers of workers will boycott work<br />\non the I 5th. \"Almost anyone, except<br />\nthe large number of working poor, can<br />\nafford to give up one day. In terms of<br />\nwhat the war is costing him in inflation,<br />\ntaxes, and interest rates, he can't afford<br />\nnot to give up that time to work against<br />\nit. It is, of course, probably tougher for<br />\na labor union guy to wear a black<br />\narmband in his plant than it is for a<br />\nstudent to give up school.\"<br />\nThe response to the moratorium has<br />\nbeen widespread. It has gotton support<br />\nfrom all segments of the community,<br />\nand, surprisingly, a boost from Nixon's<br />\ncommeat concerning the moratorium<br />\nthat \"uVer no circumstances will I be<br />\naffected whatever by it.\" The remark<br />\nworked to ally many previously neutral<br />\npeople on the side of the moratorium.<br />\nThe press coverage has been extensive,<br />\nwith major stores running almost daily<br />\nin the news media. The most fervent<br />\nsupport has come from the universities.<br />\nAs Brown says, \"The response has been<br />\nrather incredible in the academic<br />\ncommunity, with a wide variety of<br />\nschools supporting it.\"<br />\n(Continued on page 5)<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nJackie Judos Jew<br /><br />\nPriest Jailed<br />\nA Roman Catholic priests request for immediate<br />\nrelease from the Dane County Jail has been denied, even<br />\nthough, according to the presiding judge, James Doyle,<br />\nFather James Groppi was confined \"without the benefit<br />\nof any of those protections normally considered<br />\nessential to due process of law.\"<br />\nFather Groppi led three days of welfare protests on<br />\nthe state Capitol, aimed at forcing the legislature to<br />\nreverse its curtailment of welfare and urban anti-poverty<br />\nfunds, and culminating in an 11-hour takeover of the<br />\nWisconsin State Assembly chambers. He was arrested last<br />\nweek on a disorderly conduct charge, and was later cited<br />\nby the Assembly for contempt under a 12I-year-old law<br />\nand ordered jailed without trial. The law has never been<br />\ntested in the courts because, up until this case, it had<br />\nnever been invoked.<br />\nAlthough he denied Father Groppi's pleas for a<br />\ntemporary restraining order, Doyle said he would not<br />\nprevent the Milwaukee priest from filing a petition for a<br />\nwrit of habeas corpus in the federal court.<br />\n\"In this situation,\" Doyle said,\"I would consider that<br />\nsuch state corrective processes as may be available would<br />\nbe ineffective unless they permitted the plaintiff prompt<br />\naccess to a state court with adequate power to act on the<br />\nmerits of his claim, and unless it provided a<br />\ndetermination of his claim with extraordinary<br />\npromptness.\"<br /><br />\nFriends<br />\nMoratorium<br />\nAfter the third of a series of meetings with the<br />\nPresident's foreign affairs adviser, a Quaker peace-action<br />\nteam endorsed the October 15 Moratorium plans.<br />\n\"They haven't learned a single lesson; they're<br />\ndetermined to prosecute the war,\" reported the five-man<br />\ndelegation of Quakers, after spending ninety minutes in<br />\nconference with Henry A. Kissinger.<br />\nThe group, representing the American Friends Service<br />\nCommittee, was in Washington for a third conference<br />\nwith Kissinger, the President's primary Vietnam adviser.<br />\nGeorge Sawyer of Indianapolis, who had been at the<br />\nMay and July meetings as well,said he was \"tremendously<br />\nless optimistic\" after the White House visit.<br />\nThe Quakers said they left the meeting \"absolutely<br />\nastounded at the rigidity of the administration.\" Sawyer<br />\nadded that \"it's apparent that the administration is<br />\nespousing peace while it is proceeding with war, and<br />\nunless the poritjca.1 man can be teached I think there will,<br />\nbe a continuation of the prosecution of the war.\"<br /><br />\nBronson P. Clark, the executive chairman of the<br />\nService Committee, said that his group had advocated<br />\nmeaningful troop withdrawals as well as an end to<br />\nAmerican support of the Thieu-Ky regime.<br />\nThe delegation found a general similarity between the<br />\nNixon and Johnson policies, except for Nixon's recent<br />\ntroop withdrawals, which the group said were designed<br />\nto assuage American public opinion.<br /><br />\nEast Side Mario<br />\nA half-dozen eggs were thrown at Controller Mario A.<br />\nProccacino Tuesday afternoon during a walking tour on<br />\nthe lower East Side.<br />\nNone of the eggs struck him. They appeared to have<br />\ncome from a group of ten Spanish-speaking dissidents<br />\nwho dogged Proccacino's steps shouting, \"Mario<br />\nMussolini\" and \"We want Lindsay.\"<br />\nTwo of the eggs hit the top of the candidate's car,<br />\nspAtering State Senator Paul P.E. Bookson's gray suit.<br />\nBookson, a Manhatan Democrat who has not yet<br />\nannounced an endorsement of mayoral candidate,<br />\nwalked along Delancey Street with Procaccino. \"Those<br />\nwere Lindsay eggs,\" said Mr. Bookson as he brushed the<br />\nmess off his trousers with a handkerchief. \"He's going to<br />\nlose his supporters this way.\"<br />\nThe group of dissidents appeared on the street when<br />\nProcaccino arrived shortly after 3 p.m. Those questioned<br />\nsaid that they were acting as individuals rather than<br />\nmembers of any organization. They carried hand-lettered<br />\nsigns saying, \"Crybaby. you make me sick/Go Away\"<br />\nand \"Mario hates kids,\" and shouted such sentiments as<br />\n\"you're a racist, Mario\" and \"A vote for Mario is a vote<br />\nfor Wallace\"<br />\nThey also shouted, \"End hate in the city.\" A woman<br />\nin the group who had been shouting unprintable names<br />\nin Spanish at Procaccino explained her position. \"I hate<br />\nProcaccino,\" she said. \"He hates the poor people; he just<br />\nwants to put them down.\"<br />\nIn the midst of the protestors, a lone Procaccino<br />\nsupporter shouted, \"Viva Mario, get this garbage off the<br />\nstreet\" in Spanish. At the end of the tour, Procaccino<br />\nhad a word with a supporter. \"Ben Franklin says, 'It's<br />\nbetter to do it well than to say it well,'\" said the<br />\ncandidate. \"Lindsay, he says a lot and doesn't do<br />\nanything at all.\" The quotation appears in none of the<br />\nstandard reference books. According to the New York<br />\nTimes, Prodaccino holds his Strongest leml.over his rivals<br />\nin the Lower East Side.<br />\n4<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nMel Finkelstein, the famous New York Daily News<br />\nphotographer, has accused Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy<br />\nOnassis of physically attacking him as he photographed<br />\nher leaving a theatre in New York showing the Swedish<br />\nfilm \"I Am Curious(Yellow)\".<br />\nMrs. Kennedy's press secretary Nancy Tuckerman,<br />\nsaid \"When I heard it, I congratulated her. But she said<br />\nthat she hadn't done it.\" Later. Miss Tuckerman told<br />\nreporters, \"It's really silly to think Mrs. Onassis could<br />\nflip over a 168-pound man just like that. She's capable<br />\nof a great many unusual things, but she couldn't do<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nThe doorman at the Cinema Rendezvous (where Mr.<br />\nand Mrs. Onassis arrived in separate cars) corroborated<br />\nthe denial. Barnardo Rojas said he witnessed the Sunday<br />\nnight debacle, and did not see the former First Lady<br />\ntouch the photographer. \"She didn't push him,\" Rojas<br />\nsaid. \"He tried to pass in front of her and slipped.\"<br />\nThe Daily News printed a picture showing Finkelstein<br />\nstruggling to his knees, while Mrs. Onassis walked away<br />\nfrom him.<br /><br />\nPapal Prerogative<br />\nWhile promising to allow freedom of expression in<br />\ntheological research, Pope Paul has threatened with<br />\nGod's judgement those Roman Catholics who attack his<br />\nteaching authority. The Pope stated that there is no<br />\nconflict between his own authority and the need for<br />\ndoctrinal studies and advice.<br />\nThe Pope was speaking at the start of the first<br />\naseembly of a thirty-member theological commission<br />\ncalled into being by him in April to help sort out t\\he<br />\ndoctrinal crisis of the church. He told the theologians<br />\nfrom 28 countries that they should help defend<br />\nCatholics from \"the numerous, excessive and pressing<br />\nerrors that are assailing the divine desposit of truth. \"<br />\nThis was a reference to the unprecedented wave of<br />\nquestioning and distorting of traditional church<br />\nteachings.<br />\nThe theologians were told that the Pope hoped for<br />\ntheir collaboration and support in his office of<br />\nMagisterium, the church's supreme teaching authority,<br />\nbut he added, \"The authority and security of his<br />\nmagisterium, as you know, derive from Christ himself,<br />\nout one and supreme master, and they are essential for<br />\nthe government, stability, peace, and unity of God's<br />\nChurch.\"<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40353, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "d46c5316-596a-459f-bad9-529f53c7a39d", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13990-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13990, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "a9bc4cf5-5f5b-4a84-83d1-e379c3db2cf4", "url": "/node/13990"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "01c20946-43d2-41f7-895c-dfb73cdede4d"}]}
