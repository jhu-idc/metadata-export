As a<br />\nJunior he was torn between<br />\nthe carefreeness of the Sophomore and the thought that he<br />\nwould soon be a Senior. And<br />\nfinally, all too soon, came the<br />\nmomentous day when he<br />\nwalked through those portals<br />\n\u2014a Senior.<br />\nBut the booming of the<br />\nGilman clock abruptly carried him back to the present<br />\nand he watched the students<br />\nhurrying to and from classes<br />\nin the coldly brilliant sun.<br />\nOne of these men, a Sophomore, by the numerals on his<br />\nsweater, walked up the steps<br />\nand entered Gilman Hall by<br />\nthe main doorway.<br />\nThe alumnus turned and<br />\nwalked slowly away.

There will then be<br />\nfour frats in each division and sixteen in each league.<br />\nThe plan is to have each team play<br />\ntwo games with each of the other<br />\nteams in its division, tlie division<br />\nwinners to play in a round-robin with<br />\nthe title going to the frat with the<br />\nhighest percentage.<br />\nOrganized Last Year<br />\nInterfraternity competition was<br />\norganized last year by the Department of Physical Training and Athletics under a point system. Fifteen<br />\npoints were awarded for a win, ten<br />\nfor a tie, and five for a game played<br />\nand lost. A plaque was permanently<br />\nawarded the first team in each sport<br />\nand a large plaque being made by<br />\nFred Turbyville was won by the frat<br />\nhaving the greatest number of points<br />\nfor the whole year.<br />\nThe first leg on this big plaque was<br />\nwon by Sigma Phi Epsilon with 330<br />\npoints.

There will then be<br />\nfour frats in each division and sixteen in each league.<br />\nThe plan is to have each team play<br />\ntwo games with each of the other<br />\nteams in its division, tlie division<br />\nwinners to play in a round-robin with<br />\nthe title going to the frat with the<br />\nhighest percentage.<br />\nOrganized Last Year<br />\nInterfraternity competition was<br />\norganized last year by the Department of Physical Training and Athletics under a point system. Fifteen<br />\npoints were awarded for a win, ten<br />\nfor a tie, and five for a game played<br />\nand lost. A plaque was permanently<br />\nawarded the first team in each sport<br />\nand a large plaque being made by<br />\nFred Turbyville was won by the frat<br />\nhaving the greatest number of points<br />\nfor the whole year.<br />\nThe first leg on this big plaque was<br />\nwon by Sigma Phi Epsilon with 330<br />\npoints. Phi Sigma Delta, the leader<br />\nfor practically the entire year, was<br />\nnosed out in the last game and fell<br />\nback to second place, five points behind the leader.<br /><br />\nWith the opening of the University<br />\ntoday, the Department of Physical<br />\nTraining and Athletics begins its second year under its new plan of athletics for all. Dr. G. Wilson Shaffer,<br />\nhead of the department, has expressed himself pleasantly surprised<br />\nat the success of his program in its<br />\ninitial year in which about seventyfive per cent of the undergraduates<br />\nparticipated. The goal is one hundred<br />\nper cent participation.<br />\nTo increase the scant hundred who<br />\nhad previously represented the Hopkins in athletics, the field of sport<br />\ncovered was increased\u2014new teams<br />\nwere added to the sports already on<br />\nthe campus and new sports were added to the Jay repertoire.<br />\nSoccer Started<br />\nAn intercollegiate soccer team was<br />\nformed under the masterminding of<br />\nFrank Dotterweich, who also tutored<br />\nthe tyro frosh lacrosse team. A golf<br />\nteam was gotten up which went<br />\nthrough the season undefeated. Paul<br />\nKais ' fencing squad gave a remarkable account of itself in its first year<br />\nat the Hopkins. Bob Owings got the<br />\nBlue team in on the revival of Maryland college baseball. The intercollegiate status of Gus Van Sant's pretzelbenders was matured. Finally, a<br />\nhandball team played three colleges<br />\nand hopes to play more this year.<br />\nAt the same time, the schedule of no<br />\nexisting team was curtailed on account of the increase in new intercollegiate activity.<br /><br />\nThe practice, begun last year in<br />\nlacrosse, of getting a schedule for a<br />\nteam whenever enough men come<br />\nout to fill a squad, will be continued<br />\nin football.
