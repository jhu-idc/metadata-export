LXXII, No. 8<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, MARYLAND, NOVEMBER 17. 1967<br />\n<br />\nUniversity Waiting For S.C.<br />\nBefore Deciding Vic's Case<br />\nRoss Jones, Secretary of the University, says that the<br />\nHopkins is waiting to speak with the Student Council<br />\nbefore issuing a policy statement on the alledged discrimination at the Marylander Barber Shop.<br />\nJones said that he had \"tried to contact Bruce Ledig,\"<br />\nStudent Council President. \"If Ledig would ever respond<br />\nto me I would ask him and Victor Dates to go to the \u2022<br />\nshop and see what the situation is.\"<br />\nLast year the Student Council took part in the barber shop discrimination case. Therefore, Jones wants to<br />\nbe sure that the Council is satisfied before he makes a<br />\nformal public statement.<br />\n\"Really,\" he said, \"there is no problem. According to<br />\nwhat I've been able to determine, he is not chargine prices<br />\nwhich tend to keep Negroes out of the shop.\" However,<br />\nhe wants Ledig to go and talk with Victor the barber. If<br />\nthe Council is satisfied that there has been no discrimination, the University will issue a public statement.<br />\nThe controversy was sparked by a sign in the shop<br />\nwhich advised that \"kinky\" hair could not be cut for less<br />\nthan three dollars. Regular haircuts cost two dollars. The<br />\nsign was recently removed, when Victor DeRuggiero,<br />\nproprietor of the shop, heard that the University objected. Razor cuts for Negroes now cost three dollars while<br />\na regular hair cut costs two dollars for anyone.<br />\nVictor says that the price hike for Negroes is due to<br />\nthe fact that their hair is harder to cut than is Caucasians' hair. He insists that he is not descriminatory.<br />\n\"Victor welcomes everyone!\" says Victor. He added that<br />\nhe had never had a Negro ask for a razor cut in his shop,<br />\nand therefore, had never charged three dollars.<br />\nArnold Rausenberger, a barber in the Levering Hall<br />\nshop, said that cutting Negroes' hair presented no special<br />\nproblems. He added that he couldn't understand why<br />\nVictor would charge extra for a razor cut of curly hair.<br />\nLedig said that the Student Council probably would<br />\ndo something about the barber shop incident. As yet,<br />\nhowever, he was not familiar with the facts. \"What has<br />\ngone on around there?\" he asked.<br />\n<br />\nFreshmen Descend To New Depths<br />\nAs Liquor Flows In Carrel Party<br />\nBy DICK CRAMER<br />\nThe administration has decided to take an unequivocal stand in regard to a party thrown in the study carrels<br />\nbeneath the freshmen dormitories.<br />\nSome freshman decided that the newly opened study<br />\nroom would be the perfect site for a small party. As the<br />\nroom can be entered only with the use of a room key<br />\nand since not many dormitory residents study on Saturday, they had no fear of being disturbed. Therefore, they<br />\nstocked the room and gave it a small house-warming.<br />\nThe room has been adequately soundproofed and the<br />\nparty was never discovered. The girls in attendance, of<br />\ncourse, left before one o'clock and the gathering was<br />\nended without incident. However, no one was overcautious about leaving traces behind.<br />\nThe next day, beer bottles and cans were found<br />\nstrewn about the rdom. One of the frosted glass partitions which separate the carrels was smashed. The administration swung into action with a concentrated investigatory program.<br />\nMrs. Van Norman, upon hearing the news, embarked<br />\non a tour of the disaster area. Later in the day, Robert<br />\nP. Bilgrave, Director of Student Affairs, was seen inspecting the premises.<br />\nMrs. Van Norman commented, \"It's a very unusual<br />\nplace for this to happen. Most people are looking for a<br />\nquiet place to study.\" As yet, she has taken no definitive<br />\n\u2022 action. According to her, it is not within her province to<br />\ndo so. \"It's the responsibility of the D.S.R.C. and the<br />\nPlant Manager's Office,\" she said. \"I really have very<br />\nlittle to do with it.\"<br />\nMr. Wesley Taylor, Plant Manager, said that, as yet, he<br />\nhas \"not talked to anyone about it.\" He added that the<br />\nmatter was the responsibility of Mrs. Van Norman and<br />\nand the D.S.R.C.<br />\nHenry Yang, President of the D.S.R.C. said, \"I<br />\nreally don't know too much about it.\" When asked under<br />\nwhose jurisdiction the incident fell, he replied, \"It's<br />\nreally only the responsibility of the D.S.R.C.\"<br />\nColonel Robert Serena, Head Resident Dorm Master,<br />\nminced no words on the incident. \"See Mr. Bilgrave,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"He's handling it\". Mr. Bilgrave could not be reached for comment.<br />\n<br />\nVietnam War Threatens Cutbacks<br />\nIn Government Grants To Hopkins<br />\nBy BOB SLOAN<br />\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second of a series concerning the financial shortages at Hopkins.<br />\nCutbacks in Federal spending for higher education due<br />\nto the Vietnam War threaten to aggravate Hopkins' financial problem.<br />\nGovernment funds to Hopkins, which made up 52%<br />\nof the current revenues for 1966-67, may be substantially reduced in the near future if the freeze on federal<br />\naid continues. A primary cause of the freeze is the enormous cost of the war in Vietnam. Smaller, lower-rated<br />\nschools have already felt the effects of the cutbacks, but<br />\nHopkins as yet has only felt the pinch slightly.<br />\nHowever, if the war drags on the shortage of funds<br />\ngoing to Hopkins will be acute. If replacement funds cannot be found the University \"will have no other choice\"<br />\nthan to make cutbacks says Bruce J. Partridge, VicePresident for the Administration. He added that because<br />\ngovernment money makes up so large a portion of the<br />\nbudget, this contraction will be the only solution.<br />\nThough Government money goes for government<br />\nprojects, the funds result in a portion of professorial<br />\nsalaries, the addition of graduate students, and the purchase of equipment for research. These side benefits of<br />\nthe federal funds for individual research add substantially<br />\nto the resources of the University.<br />\nWhen a professor applies for a grant to do individual<br />\nresearch, the request must first be approved by the<br />\nUniversity with respect to its cost and the number of<br />\nhours involved. If the University approves the project,<br />\nthe request goes to the government board kir approval.<br />\nIf, for example, the professor will spend half his time<br />\nfor research, the government will pay half of his normal<br />\nsalary. Graduate students are hired and the cost they incur is shared by the University and government; the same<br />\nholds for purchased equipment.<br />\n<br />\nOn the Inside:<br />\nWe pay a special tribute<br />\nto our capitalist sponsors.<br />\nSee all pages.<br />\n<br />\n72ND YEAR<br />\n<br />\nHousemaster's Report Scores<br />\nFood Service Administration<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on Page 2)<br />\n<br />\nDoyle Smith; a dormitory housemaster, submitted a<br />\nreport two weeks ago, highly critical of the administration of the food service.<br />\nThe report, submitted to Howard LaShaw, director of<br />\nthe dormitory Food Service, concluded that the Food<br />\nService \"should be run on a cash basis.\" Smith stated<br />\nthat \"the only way to cut out the flab\" is to run the<br />\nFood Service on a competitive basis.<br />\nSmith surveyed dormitory residents in order to compile his report. The report was initiated by request of the<br />\nPlant Manager's Office.<br />\nThe report criticized the time scheduling of the cafeteria, as well as the machinery involved in the operation<br />\nof the food service.<br />\nA particular target of Smith's report was a \"young<br />\nundergraduate\" employed by the cafeteria. Besides being<br />\n\"unclean, flippant and generally incompetent\" as Smith<br />\nimplied that most of the student help were, he distastefully noticed the undergraduate's habit of \"picking his<br />\nnose and running his fingers through his hair and then<br />\nserving you.\"<br />\nIn the survey which Smith conducted, 27 floors in the<br />\nFreshman houses were polled. Some \"novelties\" which<br />\nSmith discovered in reviewing the complaints included a<br />\nfreshman finding a fly \"cooked into his roll.\"<br />\nFour floors of freshman complained about finding<br />\nhair in their food. Ten floors noted the quantity of dirty<br />\ndishes. While there was unanimous sentiment that food<br />\nin the cafeteria was poor, twelve floors of freshman indicated that they just couldn't get enough of it.<br />\nSmith concluded that \"the administration must come<br />\nto grips with the food problem, and it is their responsibility to do whatever is needed to repair defects in the<br />\nFood Service. The handicap of budgets is the Plant Manager's office doing, not the students.\"<br />\nSmith stated that \"it should be made clear that we expect action, prompt and decisive actions.\"<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Leads In The Developing<br />\nOf New Drug To Treat Blood Clots<br />\n<br />\nHieronimous Exhibit Provokes<br />\nCharges Of Religious Blasphemy<br />\n<br />\nDr. Henry Wagner and Dr. Donald Tow, researchers at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, will be among<br />\nthe leading participants in the test of urokinase, a new<br />\ndrug for the effective treatment of arterial thrombosis.<br />\nUrokinase,so named because it is derived from human<br />\nurine, is not designed for the prevention of arterial<br />\nthrombosis, but instead it will be used to dissolve clots<br />\nin the arteries.<br />\nBoth Dr. Wagner and Dr. Tow hope that this drug will<br />\nbe effective in the correction of such medical disorders<br />\nas pulmonary embolism and mycardal infarctions.<br />\nUrokinase will enable doctors to dissolve blood clots<br />\nin a matter of hours, a process which presently takes up<br />\nto three weeks With present treatment patients often<br />\ndie or are seriously disabled.<br />\nNeither Hopkins' doctors have spent all their time on<br />\nurine. Working concurrently they have developed an<br />\n\"isotope scanning system,\" which allows them to see<br />\nwhat affect the drug is having. This technique promises<br />\nmany other possibilities, yet to be examined.<br />\nUrokinase likewise enables the development of new<br />\ntechniques in blood transfusion. \"In fact,\" states Dr.<br />\nTibor Greenwalt, medical director of the American<br />\nNational Red Cross,\"it is now old-fashioned to use whole<br />\nblood for transfusions.\"<br />\nHe added that it is now possible to take only the<br />\nplasma from the blood and return the remaining components of the blood to the body. This technique will aid<br />\nin alleviating the problem caused by a shortage' of available blood in today's hospitals.<br />\nIn practice, this means that as much as one liter ot<br />\nplasma a week could be removed from a healthy donor<br />\nwithout any ill effects.<br />\nThis ability to transfuse large quantities of blood<br />\nmeans that parents of a child suffering from leukemia<br />\nmight \"donate just the platelets in their blood up to two<br />\nor three times a week.\"<br />\nPlatelet transfusions are used to control bleeding in<br />\nleukemia.<br />\nUrokinase and other new techniques for the treatment of blood disorders, were outlined by the panel of<br />\nexperts during the briefing of\"New Horizons in Science<br />\nsponsored by the Washington University in St. Louis<br />\nand The Council for the Advancement of Science Writing.<br />\n<br />\nby DENNIS ESTIS<br />\nSeveral persons, including faculty wives, have charged<br />\nthat the art exhibit of Robert Hieronimus, 'currently<br />\nbeing shown at Levering Hall, is \"irreverent\".<br />\nThose people, both in the Hopkins community and in<br />\nthe City, have been shocked by the artists' portrayal of<br />\nof the Christ figure and several other symbols which he<br />\nemploys.<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire, Director of Levering Hall, expressed the opinion that these charges were minor in<br />\nnature. Dr. Wickwire felt that the comments made were<br />\ntypical reactions one \"might expect from persons not<br />\naccustomed to this kind of art\".<br />\n\"Hieronimus is hot attempting to be irreverent,\" said<br />\nWickwire, \"but he feels that America, and not himself,<br />\nhas desecrated these symbols.\"<br />\nIn reply to the charges. Hieronimus said that he also<br />\nhad some complaints. He placed the primary blame on<br />\nthe present leaders of our nation in every field of endeavor, including religion. \"Our religious leaders have not<br />\nlistened to the needs of the generation. The symbols are<br />\nnot a slap at all. Man needs God, but not in a traditional<br />\nsense.\"<br />\nDr. Wickwire feels that the exhibit is \"very worthwhile\", and believes that it has \"livened things up.\"<br />\nThe exhibit features a sculpture of a dummy which is<br />\ncrucified on a wooden cross. The dummy is decorated<br />\nwith symbols of American materialism such as Coke buttons,and dollar signs. The exhibit also includes paintings,<br />\npen drawings, and a sculpture which revolves on a turntable.<br />\nHieronimus is also involved in other activities. He goes<br />\nto the Maryland Institute and used to teach in public<br />\nschools in Baltimore County. He painted the front of<br />\nthe new Black Jack night club on Lafayette Avenue,and<br />\nhe spends his spare time painting bodies on Howard<br />\nStreet. He is most noted on campus for his multicolored<br />\n\"symbolic Volkswagen\" and his poster advertising the<br />\n\"Mothers of Invention\" concert.<br />\nMany of the works on display at the exhibit can be<br />\npurchased from the author at a nominal fee. There are<br />\ncertain paintings which cost as much as $1000.<br />\nImmediately at the close of the Hieronimus show,an<br />\nexhibit of ceramic pieces will be displayed, along with<br />\nworks by Mrs. Raya Bueding.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 17, 1%7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE TWO<br />\n<br />\nWhat kind do you smoke?<br />\nWiliam,<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n7rivarden<br />\n1111101.Clturc<br />\n<br />\nMONZA<br />\n<br />\nWhatever kind you smoke,<br />\nyou owe it to yourself to<br />\ntry MONZA Pipe Tobacco.<br />\nYour favorite pipe will give<br />\nyou more pleasure when<br />\nou choose this imported<br />\nblend of the world's fine<br />\ntobaccos.<br />\n<br />\nmove up to<br />\n<br />\nPIPE TOSACCO<br />\n<br />\nt Cutbacks<br />\nVietnam War Threatens Gran<br />\npay the full professor's salary.<br />\n<br />\nThe promise of government aid<br />\nmany very capable, and well<br />\nlures<br />\nHowever, funds may be cut<br />\nto campuses which<br />\nprofessors<br />\npaid<br />\ngraduate<br />\nthe<br />\nhappens,<br />\nback.

Despite the recent<br />\noutlay of money for unseen improvements, and compared to many<br />\nuniversities throughout the nation who are rapidly expanding their<br />\ndormitory facilities with new and modern structures, Hopkins students are resigned to living in two-tone cinder block cell blocks.<br />\nGranted, Hopkins cannot suddenly refurbish or build new dorms at<br />\nthe moment, but it can furnish the dormitory diner with more nutritious and attractive meals.<br />\nAmong the complaints listed in Smith's report(A compilation of<br />\nfreshman grievances) were: too much starch, too small poultry, too<br />\nlittle food, dirty utensils, no variety or choice in any one meal,<br />\ngreasy food, little fruit, hair and flies (ad nauseum) in food, badly<br />\nprepared desserts,etc., etc ...There is no excuse for these conditions<br />\nto continue. One need only go as close by as Notre Dame to see how<br />\nwell some students are able to eat.<br />\nHousemaster Smith comes to the conclusion that the food service should henceforth be run on a cash basis, which would force it<br />\nto become more competitive \u2014 that is, if better food were offered,<br />\nmore students would patronize the dining room; if a poor meal were<br />\nserved, students could eat elsewhere and only the food service would<br />\nlose out.<br />\nWe strongly recommend that the Plant Manager's Office look into<br />\nsuch a proposition by requesting bids from competing food services,<br />\nincluding the largest and most popular service, which, incidentally,<br />\nfeeds the hungry mouths at Goucher and Notre Dame. To have a dormitory with good enough food and organization to attract enough<br />\ndorm students to eat there on a cash basis would entail a considerably<br />\nlarger budget for food on the part of the Plant Manager. But the<br />\nmoney which many dorm residents now lose by missing meals breakfasts when they sleep late, lunches when they have classes, din- _<br />\nner when they are away - Or parents come to town - would perhaps make up for the more expensive meals served on a cash basis.<br />\nHow far more democratic it would be to pay for the mealswhich you<br />\nare here to eat and which you want to eat, rather than paying for the<br />\nliver you do not eat and the stone-hard cake you cannot digest.<br />\nAt a recent ODK meeting, Hopkins Plant Manager Wesley Taylor<br />\nexplained that he had once received bids from several food services,<br />\nand the present management had underbid all others. He also expressed his faith in the product it offers the dorm students at dinner<br />\ntime. Mr. Taylor is also the gentleman, reliable sources have told us,<br />\nwho recently suggested that the Kosher Dining Room lower its quality of food if it wants to lower its prices. Such a truism we do not<br />\ndispute, but we certainly hope he has not lowered the quality of<br />\nfood in the dormitory for this reason when we have been told by<br />\nDoyle Smith that students there would prefer paying slightly more if<br />\nthey could be assured of a corresponding improvement in their<br />\nmeals.<br />\nWe feel certain that if the concerned parties in the administration<br />\ndevoted their time to trying to find a more effective and appetizing<br />\nmean of feeding the dorm students rather than quieting and calming incipient food protests, then perhaps a solution to the problem<br />\ncould be found. But in case the Plant Manager is not sensitive to the<br />\nrequest of Doyle Smith and other students, then dorm residents<br />\nmay well find last year's student council president Bill Reinsch's<br />\nsuggestion the most effective - -dump an entire dinner on the steps<br />\nof Homewood House.<br />\n<br />\nEh, Johns nphtn\u00f8 Pistaa-Ettist<br />\nEDITORS-IN-CHIEF<br />\nRoger C.

Until it reaches that happy estate (and the Great Pumpkin rises<br />\nfrom the Homewood patch), some<br />\nmembers of the community will<br />\nview any improvements as mere<br />\ntokenism. Meanwhile, however, responsible criticism from The<br />\nNews-Letter and other voices of<br />\noutraged literacy can help to<br />\nnudge the Book Center along toward a more effective role in the<br />\ntotal educational processs.<br />\nAlthough I recognize the tone<br />\nof slightly cracked authority, an<br />\noccupational disease, as indeed my<br />\nown, the ex cathedra statements<br />\nwhich Dick Cramer ascribed to me<br />\nin his lively article on the Book<br />\nCenter seemed to appear some-<br />\n<br />\nwhat out of context. Memory is<br />\nspecial pleading and protest makes<br />\nbetter copy than progress, but my<br />\nown recollection is that I prefaced<br />\nthe remark about plenty of room<br />\nfor improvement with the comment that 1967 has seen more<br />\nconstructive changes in bookish<br />\npolicy than I can remember during<br />\nthe rest -of my stay at Hopkins.<br />\n(And, I'd quickly add, not enough<br />\nchanges to satisfy the legitimate<br />\nexpectations of the students, the<br />\nfaculty, or, for the matter, the<br />\nManager.)<br />\nAs you have reminded us in the<br />\npast, The News-Letter has played<br />\nan instrumental role in provoking<br />\nsome of these changes.

And<br />\nthey are not going to become this<br />\nway by the grace of the Administration. Any student bill of rights<br />\nthat wousld be acceptable to the<br />\nAdministration would be per se an<br />\nineffective one. This does not<br />\nmean that the effort to draw up a<br />\nbill of rights should be abandoned.<br />\nRather it means that such a document should be presented as a list<br />\nof demands, demands that the students are prepared to back up with<br />\naction.<br />\nAs a guide in drawing up such a<br />\nbill, every Council member should<br />\nread the Declaration of the Canadian Student, passed last September at the Congress of the Cana(Continued on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\nStore reform in their political<br />\nplatforms also helped.

In addition, a permanent<br />\npolicy committee was established<br />\nto see that the recommendations<br />\nfound their way into practice and<br />\nto serve as an effective channel<br />\nfor suggestions and complaints<br />\nfrom all members of the community. (To the best of my knowledge, the committee has not addressed itself, as reported, to the<br />\nstaff's need for a green room or<br />\nany similar request, although suggestions from the employees toward the improvement of service<br />\nand conditions are just as welcome<br />\nas those from the students or faculty. Presumably all members of<br />\nthe community are enfranchised<br />\nto complain and to propose.)

Connell's recent novel, The Diary of a<br />\nRapist, quixotically appears under<br />\n\"Sociology,\" while books about<br />\nthe Kennedy clan and the Kama<br />\nSutra tend to turn up under \"Humor.\" For my part, I'm still trying to parse the difference be-<br />\n<br />\nCAMPUS<br />\nINTERVIEWS<br />\nNEXT WEEK<br />\nGraduates at all degree levels<br />\nare urged to investigate<br />\nthe career opportunities at<br />\n<br />\nNIH<br />\nThe world's largest center<br />\nfor conquest of disease<br />\nand improvement of human health<br />\nThe National Institutes of Health\u2014NIH\u2014is the principal research<br />\narm of the U.S. Public Health Service, and conducts many of the<br />\nmost advanced programs in medical science today. These programs require specialists in a wide range of disciplines. Example: Right now NIH has openings in the following areas:<br />\nCHEMISTS . . . BIOLOGISTS . . . NURSES . . .

Starting salaries are attractive and opportunity for advancement is<br />\n<br />\ntween \"Fiction\" and \"Literature.\"<br />\nThe decision to extend a 10%<br />\ndiscount on \"trade\" books to all<br />\ncustomers was in response to the<br />\nexplicit request of many students<br />\nand faculty members. This proposal, in fact, seemed the most urgent of the student suggestions.<br />\nThe distinctions between \"trade\"<br />\nand \"text\" categories are made by<br />\nthe publishers, not the management of the Book Center. (In a<br />\nfew cases, the Manager has been<br />\nable to translate a given title to a<br />\ntrade discount by stocking the entire series, e.g. the Loeb Library.)<br />\nThe decision on discounts was a<br />\nprovisional one, involving some<br />\npossible deficits if the volume does<br />\nnot increase in the trade department. The original committee report suggested that discount policy should not be given priority<br />\nover the scope and quality of the<br />\nstock. To my knowledge, only one<br />\nfaculty member lamented the lost<br />\ndiscount on non-trade items, and<br />\nthis was on principle a reluctance<br />\nto give up benefits. If the students<br />\nfeel that the discount is irrelevant,<br />\nit can be revoked and the savings<br />\ndirected toward either improvements in the Book Center.<br />\nObviously, the most trying aspect of the Book Center this year<br />\nhas been the incredible hang-up<br />\nabout texts and special orders.

The Center has added to the<br />\nstaff in an effort to meet some of<br />\nthe problems, but for almost three<br />\nmonths was without an invoice<br />\nclerk. Further, there are alwavc<br />\nfamiliar delays: the faculty is notoriously slow in submitting lists<br />\nof texts for courses (mea culpa),<br />\nin part because the new courses<br />\nfrequently do not take shape until<br />\nthose few clear days in June; the<br />\ntext houses are so busy effecting<br />\ncorporate mergers that their warehousing and order departments are<br />\nincreasingly fallible (books listed<br />\nas \"in print\" often turn out to be<br />\nnot available until December\");<br />\neven that most addled monopoly,<br />\nthe U.S. Post Office, has increasingly contributed its share of confusion. And finally, the failure to<br />\nanticipate the number of books<br />\nneeded in each course is a direct<br />\nresult of taking too seriously what<br />\nthe students took too lightly:<br />\nspring pre-registration.<br />\nCompared with the massive text<br />\norders of the multiversities, the<br />\nIlopkins Book Center is a quaintly<br />\nsmall operation.

Coach Gary<br />\n<br />\nBy JIM SLOAN<br />\nSports Editor<br />\n<br />\nAlthough in almost every other<br />\ncountry in the world, soccer is the<br />\nnational sport; in America the emphasis is focused on football - The<br />\nspectator sport. This fact is especially evident on the professional<br />\nand collegiate levels, and Hopkins<br />\nis no exception.<br />\nThe universal appeal which soccer arouses for peoples of all nationalities certainly must have<br />\nsome relevancy to American fans.<br />\nIndeed it has, as witnessed by the<br />\nattempts.of the new professional<br />\nsoccer organizations. The facination which many fans hold for the<br />\ngame can be only partially explained. The sport Is one of continual action and perpetual motion. The substitutions are minimal, and the rules are easy to<br />\nunderstand.<br />\nBody contact is also present in<br />\nsoccer, and the game requires coordination of the entire body in<br />\nall aspects of play.

Last Saturday they<br />\nventured to the Gallaudet Invitational in Washington. Despite the<br />\nloss of one participant, the Jays<br />\nran gamely,- and came in fifth<br />\namong the nine teams entered. The<br />\npathetic thing was that the second<br />\nplace team was a mere 18 points<br />\nahead. Still Jeff Lauren, John Wilken and Cliff Cyr were medal winners among the myriad of runners.<br />\nOnly victorious American University took more medals than Hopkins.<br />\nBitter about the muddy trails<br />\nthey encountered, the harriers excused dropping both ends of a<br />\ntriangular meet to Gettysburg and<br />\nRider. Apparently the major obstacles were their opponents, as<br />\nthey lost to Gettysburg 24 to 33<br />\nand to Rider 26 to 29. As usual<br />\nLauren led the pack with a third<br />\nclocking in 28:29. Captain Cyr<br />\nskirted in at seventh place. Probably the most encouraging sign<br />\n<br />\nthe return of injured John<br />\nMcKeon, who took fourteenth<br />\nplace.<br />\nFour days earlier Jeff Lauren<br />\nfell victim to a cramp, and with<br />\nhim crumbled the Jay's fortunes<br />\nin a 20 to 39 drubbing at the hands<br />\nof visiting Swarthmore, John Witken and Cliff Cyr placed third and<br />\nfifth, but their comrads were un-<br />\n<br />\nable to keep pace.<br />\nThe freshmen have closed their<br />\ncampaign with a 3-2-1 mark. They<br />\nhave been quite consistent in losing to Bainbridge Prep twice, taking Towson State twice,Poly once,<br />\nand drawing even with Mount St.<br />\nJoseph.

Champs Battle Terrors<br />\nBy MIKE PHILLIPS<br />\nAssured the Southen Division<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference championship - Hopkins' first such title<br />\nsince 1960 - the varsity football<br />\nteam puts its new-found reputation on the line tomorrow, when<br />\nit concludes the 1967 season by<br />\nhosting second-place M.A.C. finisher Western Maryland at 2:00<br />\np.m. \u2022<br />\nThe Terrors, 3-1 in the league<br />\nand 5-2 overall, are quite possibly<br />\nthe strongest - and certainly the<br />\nmost opportunistic - group the<br />\nJays have faced this year. In routing Randolph-Macon, which handed Horkins its lone setback by 4822, the Westminster squad utilized<br />\nits particular abilities to the utmost,capitalizing on six pass interceptions and three fumbles to win<br />\n35-3.<br />\nKey to Western Maryland's success this season has been its defensive unit, a group that has allowed<br />\nbut 77 points in seven games(Hopkins: 87 in six) and permitted<br />\nmore than one touchdown in only<br />\ntwo of them. Standouts in this<br />\ngroup are linebacker John Heritage, middle guard Joe Anthony,<br />\ntackle Vic McTeer (who goes at<br />\n6-4 and 240 pounds). To some extent the game's outcome will hinge<br />\non the effectiveness of this contingent against Hopkins' forty-pointa-game offense.<br />\n<br />\nCridders \"Right- to Division Title<br />\nTo Be Tested by Victors<br />\nOf Randolph-Macon<br />\n<br />\nbit of an anomaly - it has averaged<br />\nover twenty points a game, yet is<br />\nunimpressive otherwise statistically (e.g. 186 yards total offense in<br />\nlast week's 15-0 defeat of Drexel),<br />\nsometimes seems overly dependent<br />\non the defense (e.g. the team's 268 conquest of Bridgewater, in<br />\nwhich it trailed in every offensive<br />\nstatistic), but is possessed of some<br />\noutstanding individuals. In quarterback Bruce Bozman (11 of 15 passes for two T.D.'s against Hopkins<br />\nlast year), a good passer, field general, and runner; and halfback Jerry Borga, a speedy power runner<br />\nwho is also the team's best pass receiver, the Terrors have two of the<br />\nbest individual performers in the<br />\nM.A.C.<br />\nReal Stakes Tomorrow<br />\nHopkins, now 5-0 in the Southern Division by virtue of last<br />\nweek's 52-6 rout of Dickinson,<br />\ncannot cede its loop leadership by<br />\nlosing to Western Maryland Saturday. What is on the line tomorrow<br />\nis its \"right\" to the Southern Division crown - the extent to which<br />\nthe championship is \"deserved.\"<br />\nWestern Maryland's lone league<br />\nloss (by 25-8) in its opener with<br />\nWagner, a power (4-0) in the generally tougher Northern Division<br />\nthe M.A.C., and its big edge<br />\nWestern Maryland's offense is a of<br />\n<br />\nagainst the one common opponent<br />\nit shares with the Jay s could establish an argument for Terror superiority only amendable to disapproval by a Hopkins win.<br />\nJay Coach Alex Sour, seemingly impressed by Western Maryland's conquest of Randolph-Macon, supported the thesis of a Terror edge. \"The Randolph-Macon<br />\ncomparative scores show we've<br />\nreally got a tough game on our<br />\nhands Saturday,\" he said. \"Western Maryland should be favored;<br />\nI don't see how it could be put any<br />\nother way.\"<br />\nEvidence Ambiguous<br />\nFor all the above, though, the<br />\navailable evidence is far from completely favoring Western Maryland.<br />\nThe Westminster club's RandolphMacon triumph came the week after that team had - aided by a soso Jay performance and some<br />\nbreaks - taken Hopkins; and Randolph-Macon which hardly played<br />\nas well as it had the week before,<br />\nmay have been complacent after<br />\nthat victory. In both ball games<br />\nthe offensive statistics of the opposed teams were fairly equal. All<br />\nin all, tomorrow's game would<br />\nseem fairly close to a tossup; and in this writer's view - the edge goes<br />\nto Hopkins.<br />\nThe course of last Saturday's<br />\n52-6 Jay win over Dickinson can<br />\nbe fairly well outlined in terms of<br />\n(Continued on Page 9)<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Kickers Win<br />\nTwo Straight Matches<br />\nBy BOB HYAMS<br />\nThe varsity soccer team captured their sixth victory of the season<br />\nlast Tuesday as they defeated a<br />\npowerful but ineffective Western<br />\nMaryland squad by 2-1.<br />\nWestern Maryland scored in the<br />\nsecond period, but the Jays tied<br />\nthe score 1-1 as Wes Bachur scored<br />\nwith an assist from Roger Purdon.<br />\nThe winning goal was scored by<br />\nRandy Miller on a penalty kick in<br />\nthe third quarter.<br />\nOn Veteran's Day, November<br />\n11, for the first time. in twenty<br />\nyears, the Jays beat Drexel by a<br />\nscore of 3-1.

Therefore, Jones wants to<br />\nbe sure that the Council is satisfied before he makes a<br />\nformal public statement.<br />\n\"Really,\" he said, \"there is no problem. According to<br />\nwhat I've been able to determine, he is not chargine prices<br />\nwhich tend to keep Negroes out of the shop.\" However,<br />\nhe wants Ledig to go and talk with Victor the barber. If<br />\nthe Council is satisfied that there has been no discrimination, the University will issue a public statement.<br />\nThe controversy was sparked by a sign in the shop<br />\nwhich advised that \"kinky\" hair could not be cut for less<br />\nthan three dollars. Regular haircuts cost two dollars. The<br />\nsign was recently removed, when Victor DeRuggiero,<br />\nproprietor of the shop, heard that the University objected. Razor cuts for Negroes now cost three dollars while<br />\na regular hair cut costs two dollars for anyone.<br />\nVictor says that the price hike for Negroes is due to<br />\nthe fact that their hair is harder to cut than is Caucasians' hair. He insists that he is not descriminatory.<br />\n\"Victor welcomes everyone!\" says Victor. He added that<br />\nhe had never had a Negro ask for a razor cut in his shop,<br />\nand therefore, had never charged three dollars.<br />\nArnold Rausenberger, a barber in the Levering Hall<br />\nshop, said that cutting Negroes' hair presented no special<br />\nproblems. He added that he couldn't understand why<br />\nVictor would charge extra for a razor cut of curly hair.<br />\nLedig said that the Student Council probably would<br />\ndo something about the barber shop incident. As yet,<br />\nhowever, he was not familiar with the facts. \"What has<br />\ngone on around there?\" he asked.<br /><br />\nFreshmen Descend To New Depths<br />\nAs Liquor Flows In Carrel Party<br />\nBy DICK CRAMER<br />\nThe administration has decided to take an unequivocal stand in regard to a party thrown in the study carrels<br />\nbeneath the freshmen dormitories.<br />\nSome freshman decided that the newly opened study<br />\nroom would be the perfect site for a small party. As the<br />\nroom can be entered only with the use of a room key<br />\nand since not many dormitory residents study on Saturday, they had no fear of being disturbed. Therefore, they<br />\nstocked the room and gave it a small house-warming.<br />\nThe room has been adequately soundproofed and the<br />\nparty was never discovered. The girls in attendance, of<br />\ncourse, left before one o'clock and the gathering was<br />\nended without incident. However, no one was overcautious about leaving traces behind.<br />\nThe next day, beer bottles and cans were found<br />\nstrewn about the rdom. One of the frosted glass partitions which separate the carrels was smashed. The administration swung into action with a concentrated investigatory program.<br />\nMrs. Van Norman, upon hearing the news, embarked<br />\non a tour of the disaster area.

Most people are looking for a<br />\nquiet place to study.\" As yet, she has taken no definitive<br />\n\u2022 action. According to her, it is not within her province to<br />\ndo so. \"It's the responsibility of the D.S.R.C. and the<br />\nPlant Manager's Office,\" she said. \"I really have very<br />\nlittle to do with it.\"<br />\nMr. Wesley Taylor, Plant Manager, said that, as yet, he<br />\nhas \"not talked to anyone about it.\" He added that the<br />\nmatter was the responsibility of Mrs. Van Norman and<br />\nand the D.S.R.C.<br />\nHenry Yang, President of the D.S.R.C. said, \"I<br />\nreally don't know too much about it.\" When asked under<br />\nwhose jurisdiction the incident fell, he replied, \"It's<br />\nreally only the responsibility of the D.S.R.C.\"<br />\nColonel Robert Serena, Head Resident Dorm Master,<br />\nminced no words on the incident. \"See Mr. Bilgrave,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"He's handling it\".

A primary cause of the freeze is the enormous cost of the war in Vietnam. Smaller, lower-rated<br />\nschools have already felt the effects of the cutbacks, but<br />\nHopkins as yet has only felt the pinch slightly.<br />\nHowever, if the war drags on the shortage of funds<br />\ngoing to Hopkins will be acute. If replacement funds cannot be found the University \"will have no other choice\"<br />\nthan to make cutbacks says Bruce J. Partridge, VicePresident for the Administration. He added that because<br />\ngovernment money makes up so large a portion of the<br />\nbudget, this contraction will be the only solution.<br />\nThough Government money goes for government<br />\nprojects, the funds result in a portion of professorial<br />\nsalaries, the addition of graduate students, and the purchase of equipment for research. These side benefits of<br />\nthe federal funds for individual research add substantially<br />\nto the resources of the University.<br />\nWhen a professor applies for a grant to do individual<br />\nresearch, the request must first be approved by the<br />\nUniversity with respect to its cost and the number of<br />\nhours involved. If the University approves the project,<br />\nthe request goes to the government board kir approval.<br />\nIf, for example, the professor will spend half his time<br />\nfor research, the government will pay half of his normal<br />\nsalary. Graduate students are hired and the cost they incur is shared by the University and government; the same<br />\nholds for purchased equipment.<br /><br />\nOn the Inside:<br />\nWe pay a special tribute<br />\nto our capitalist sponsors.<br />\nSee all pages.<br /><br />\n72ND YEAR<br /><br />\nHousemaster's Report Scores<br />\nFood Service Administration<br /><br />\n(Continued on Page 2)<br /><br />\nDoyle Smith; a dormitory housemaster, submitted a<br />\nreport two weeks ago, highly critical of the administration of the food service.<br />\nThe report, submitted to Howard LaShaw, director of<br />\nthe dormitory Food Service, concluded that the Food<br />\nService \"should be run on a cash basis.\" Smith stated<br />\nthat \"the only way to cut out the flab\" is to run the<br />\nFood Service on a competitive basis.<br />\nSmith surveyed dormitory residents in order to compile his report. The report was initiated by request of the<br />\nPlant Manager's Office.<br />\nThe report criticized the time scheduling of the cafeteria, as well as the machinery involved in the operation<br />\nof the food service.<br />\nA particular target of Smith's report was a \"young<br />\nundergraduate\" employed by the cafeteria. Besides being<br />\n\"unclean, flippant and generally incompetent\" as Smith<br />\nimplied that most of the student help were, he distastefully noticed the undergraduate's habit of \"picking his<br />\nnose and running his fingers through his hair and then<br />\nserving you.\"<br />\nIn the survey which Smith conducted, 27 floors in the<br />\nFreshman houses were polled. Some \"novelties\" which<br />\nSmith discovered in reviewing the complaints included a<br />\nfreshman finding a fly \"cooked into his roll.\"<br />\nFour floors of freshman complained about finding<br />\nhair in their food. Ten floors noted the quantity of dirty<br />\ndishes. While there was unanimous sentiment that food<br />\nin the cafeteria was poor, twelve floors of freshman indicated that they just couldn't get enough of it.<br />\nSmith concluded that \"the administration must come<br />\nto grips with the food problem, and it is their responsibility to do whatever is needed to repair defects in the<br />\nFood Service. The handicap of budgets is the Plant Manager's office doing, not the students.\"<br />\nSmith stated that \"it should be made clear that we expect action, prompt and decisive actions.\"<br /><br />\nHopkins Leads In The Developing<br />\nOf New Drug To Treat Blood Clots<br /><br />\nHieronimous Exhibit Provokes<br />\nCharges Of Religious Blasphemy<br /><br />\nDr. Henry Wagner and Dr. Donald Tow, researchers at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, will be among<br />\nthe leading participants in the test of urokinase, a new<br />\ndrug for the effective treatment of arterial thrombosis.<br />\nUrokinase,so named because it is derived from human<br />\nurine, is not designed for the prevention of arterial<br />\nthrombosis, but instead it will be used to dissolve clots<br />\nin the arteries.<br />\nBoth Dr. Wagner and Dr. Tow hope that this drug will<br />\nbe effective in the correction of such medical disorders<br />\nas pulmonary embolism and mycardal infarctions.<br />\nUrokinase will enable doctors to dissolve blood clots<br />\nin a matter of hours, a process which presently takes up<br />\nto three weeks With present treatment patients often<br />\ndie or are seriously disabled.<br />\nNeither Hopkins' doctors have spent all their time on<br />\nurine. Working concurrently they have developed an<br />\n\"isotope scanning system,\" which allows them to see<br />\nwhat affect the drug is having. This technique promises<br />\nmany other possibilities, yet to be examined.<br />\nUrokinase likewise enables the development of new<br />\ntechniques in blood transfusion. \"In fact,\" states Dr.<br />\nTibor Greenwalt, medical director of the American<br />\nNational Red Cross,\"it is now old-fashioned to use whole<br />\nblood for transfusions.\"<br />\nHe added that it is now possible to take only the<br />\nplasma from the blood and return the remaining components of the blood to the body. This technique will aid<br />\nin alleviating the problem caused by a shortage' of available blood in today's hospitals.<br />\nIn practice, this means that as much as one liter ot<br />\nplasma a week could be removed from a healthy donor<br />\nwithout any ill effects.<br />\nThis ability to transfuse large quantities of blood<br />\nmeans that parents of a child suffering from leukemia<br />\nmight \"donate just the platelets in their blood up to two<br />\nor three times a week.\"<br />\nPlatelet transfusions are used to control bleeding in<br />\nleukemia.<br />\nUrokinase and other new techniques for the treatment of blood disorders, were outlined by the panel of<br />\nexperts during the briefing of\"New Horizons in Science<br />\nsponsored by the Washington University in St. Louis<br />\nand The Council for the Advancement of Science Writing.<br /><br />\nby DENNIS ESTIS<br />\nSeveral persons, including faculty wives, have charged<br />\nthat the art exhibit of Robert Hieronimus, 'currently<br />\nbeing shown at Levering Hall, is \"irreverent\".<br />\nThose people, both in the Hopkins community and in<br />\nthe City, have been shocked by the artists' portrayal of<br />\nof the Christ figure and several other symbols which he<br />\nemploys.<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire, Director of Levering Hall, expressed the opinion that these charges were minor in<br />\nnature. Dr. Wickwire felt that the comments made were<br />\ntypical reactions one \"might expect from persons not<br />\naccustomed to this kind of art\".<br />\n\"Hieronimus is hot attempting to be irreverent,\" said<br />\nWickwire, \"but he feels that America, and not himself,<br />\nhas desecrated these symbols.\"<br />\nIn reply to the charges. Hieronimus said that he also<br />\nhad some complaints. He placed the primary blame on<br />\nthe present leaders of our nation in every field of endeavor, including religion. \"Our religious leaders have not<br />\nlistened to the needs of the generation. The symbols are<br />\nnot a slap at all. Man needs God, but not in a traditional<br />\nsense.\"<br />\nDr. Wickwire feels that the exhibit is \"very worthwhile\", and believes that it has \"livened things up.\"<br />\nThe exhibit features a sculpture of a dummy which is<br />\ncrucified on a wooden cross. The dummy is decorated<br />\nwith symbols of American materialism such as Coke buttons,and dollar signs. The exhibit also includes paintings,<br />\npen drawings, and a sculpture which revolves on a turntable.<br />\nHieronimus is also involved in other activities. He goes<br />\nto the Maryland Institute and used to teach in public<br />\nschools in Baltimore County. He painted the front of<br />\nthe new Black Jack night club on Lafayette Avenue,and<br />\nhe spends his spare time painting bodies on Howard<br />\nStreet. He is most noted on campus for his multicolored<br />\n\"symbolic Volkswagen\" and his poster advertising the<br />\n\"Mothers of Invention\" concert.<br />\nMany of the works on display at the exhibit can be<br />\npurchased from the author at a nominal fee.

Despite the recent<br />\noutlay of money for unseen improvements, and compared to many<br />\nuniversities throughout the nation who are rapidly expanding their<br />\ndormitory facilities with new and modern structures, Hopkins students are resigned to living in two-tone cinder block cell blocks.<br />\nGranted, Hopkins cannot suddenly refurbish or build new dorms at<br />\nthe moment, but it can furnish the dormitory diner with more nutritious and attractive meals.<br />\nAmong the complaints listed in Smith's report(A compilation of<br />\nfreshman grievances) were: too much starch, too small poultry, too<br />\nlittle food, dirty utensils, no variety or choice in any one meal,<br />\ngreasy food, little fruit, hair and flies (ad nauseum) in food, badly<br />\nprepared desserts,etc., etc ...There is no excuse for these conditions<br />\nto continue. One need only go as close by as Notre Dame to see how<br />\nwell some students are able to eat.<br />\nHousemaster Smith comes to the conclusion that the food service should henceforth be run on a cash basis, which would force it<br />\nto become more competitive \u2014 that is, if better food were offered,<br />\nmore students would patronize the dining room; if a poor meal were<br />\nserved, students could eat elsewhere and only the food service would<br />\nlose out.<br />\nWe strongly recommend that the Plant Manager's Office look into<br />\nsuch a proposition by requesting bids from competing food services,<br />\nincluding the largest and most popular service, which, incidentally,<br />\nfeeds the hungry mouths at Goucher and Notre Dame. To have a dormitory with good enough food and organization to attract enough<br />\ndorm students to eat there on a cash basis would entail a considerably<br />\nlarger budget for food on the part of the Plant Manager. But the<br />\nmoney which many dorm residents now lose by missing meals breakfasts when they sleep late, lunches when they have classes, din- _<br />\nner when they are away - Or parents come to town - would perhaps make up for the more expensive meals served on a cash basis.<br />\nHow far more democratic it would be to pay for the mealswhich you<br />\nare here to eat and which you want to eat, rather than paying for the<br />\nliver you do not eat and the stone-hard cake you cannot digest.<br />\nAt a recent ODK meeting, Hopkins Plant Manager Wesley Taylor<br />\nexplained that he had once received bids from several food services,<br />\nand the present management had underbid all others. He also expressed his faith in the product it offers the dorm students at dinner<br />\ntime. Mr. Taylor is also the gentleman, reliable sources have told us,<br />\nwho recently suggested that the Kosher Dining Room lower its quality of food if it wants to lower its prices. Such a truism we do not<br />\ndispute, but we certainly hope he has not lowered the quality of<br />\nfood in the dormitory for this reason when we have been told by<br />\nDoyle Smith that students there would prefer paying slightly more if<br />\nthey could be assured of a corresponding improvement in their<br />\nmeals.<br />\nWe feel certain that if the concerned parties in the administration<br />\ndevoted their time to trying to find a more effective and appetizing<br />\nmean of feeding the dorm students rather than quieting and calming incipient food protests, then perhaps a solution to the problem<br />\ncould be found. But in case the Plant Manager is not sensitive to the<br />\nrequest of Doyle Smith and other students, then dorm residents<br />\nmay well find last year's student council president Bill Reinsch's<br />\nsuggestion the most effective - -dump an entire dinner on the steps<br />\nof Homewood House.<br /><br />\nEh, Johns nphtn\u00f8 Pistaa-Ettist<br />\nEDITORS-IN-CHIEF<br />\nRoger C.

The original committee report suggested that discount policy should not be given priority<br />\nover the scope and quality of the<br />\nstock. To my knowledge, only one<br />\nfaculty member lamented the lost<br />\ndiscount on non-trade items, and<br />\nthis was on principle a reluctance<br />\nto give up benefits.

Last Saturday they<br />\nventured to the Gallaudet Invitational in Washington. Despite the<br />\nloss of one participant, the Jays<br />\nran gamely,- and came in fifth<br />\namong the nine teams entered. The<br />\npathetic thing was that the second<br />\nplace team was a mere 18 points<br />\nahead. Still Jeff Lauren, John Wilken and Cliff Cyr were medal winners among the myriad of runners.<br />\nOnly victorious American University took more medals than Hopkins.<br />\nBitter about the muddy trails<br />\nthey encountered, the harriers excused dropping both ends of a<br />\ntriangular meet to Gettysburg and<br />\nRider. Apparently the major obstacles were their opponents, as<br />\nthey lost to Gettysburg 24 to 33<br />\nand to Rider 26 to 29. As usual<br />\nLauren led the pack with a third<br />\nclocking in 28:29. Captain Cyr<br />\nskirted in at seventh place. Probably the most encouraging sign<br /><br />\nthe return of injured John<br />\nMcKeon, who took fourteenth<br />\nplace.<br />\nFour days earlier Jeff Lauren<br />\nfell victim to a cramp, and with<br />\nhim crumbled the Jay's fortunes<br />\nin a 20 to 39 drubbing at the hands<br />\nof visiting Swarthmore, John Witken and Cliff Cyr placed third and<br />\nfifth, but their comrads were un-<br /><br />\nable to keep pace.<br />\nThe freshmen have closed their<br />\ncampaign with a 3-2-1 mark. They<br />\nhave been quite consistent in losing to Bainbridge Prep twice, taking Towson State twice,Poly once,<br />\nand drawing even with Mount St.<br />\nJoseph.

Champs Battle Terrors<br />\nBy MIKE PHILLIPS<br />\nAssured the Southen Division<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference championship - Hopkins' first such title<br />\nsince 1960 - the varsity football<br />\nteam puts its new-found reputation on the line tomorrow, when<br />\nit concludes the 1967 season by<br />\nhosting second-place M.A.C. finisher Western Maryland at 2:00<br />\np.m. \u2022<br />\nThe Terrors, 3-1 in the league<br />\nand 5-2 overall, are quite possibly<br />\nthe strongest - and certainly the<br />\nmost opportunistic - group the<br />\nJays have faced this year. In routing Randolph-Macon, which handed Horkins its lone setback by 4822, the Westminster squad utilized<br />\nits particular abilities to the utmost,capitalizing on six pass interceptions and three fumbles to win<br />\n35-3.<br />\nKey to Western Maryland's success this season has been its defensive unit, a group that has allowed<br />\nbut 77 points in seven games(Hopkins: 87 in six) and permitted<br />\nmore than one touchdown in only<br />\ntwo of them. Standouts in this<br />\ngroup are linebacker John Heritage, middle guard Joe Anthony,<br />\ntackle Vic McTeer (who goes at<br />\n6-4 and 240 pounds). To some extent the game's outcome will hinge<br />\non the effectiveness of this contingent against Hopkins' forty-pointa-game offense.<br /><br />\nCridders \"Right- to Division Title<br />\nTo Be Tested by Victors<br />\nOf Randolph-Macon<br /><br />\nbit of an anomaly - it has averaged<br />\nover twenty points a game, yet is<br />\nunimpressive otherwise statistically (e.g. 186 yards total offense in<br />\nlast week's 15-0 defeat of Drexel),<br />\nsometimes seems overly dependent<br />\non the defense (e.g. the team's 268 conquest of Bridgewater, in<br />\nwhich it trailed in every offensive<br />\nstatistic), but is possessed of some<br />\noutstanding individuals. In quarterback Bruce Bozman (11 of 15 passes for two T.D.'s against Hopkins<br />\nlast year), a good passer, field general, and runner; and halfback Jerry Borga, a speedy power runner<br />\nwho is also the team's best pass receiver, the Terrors have two of the<br />\nbest individual performers in the<br />\nM.A.C.<br />\nReal Stakes Tomorrow<br />\nHopkins, now 5-0 in the Southern Division by virtue of last<br />\nweek's 52-6 rout of Dickinson,<br />\ncannot cede its loop leadership by<br />\nlosing to Western Maryland Saturday. What is on the line tomorrow<br />\nis its \"right\" to the Southern Division crown - the extent to which<br />\nthe championship is \"deserved.\"<br />\nWestern Maryland's lone league<br />\nloss (by 25-8) in its opener with<br />\nWagner, a power (4-0) in the generally tougher Northern Division<br />\nthe M.A.C., and its big edge<br />\nWestern Maryland's offense is a of<br /><br />\nagainst the one common opponent<br />\nit shares with the Jay s could establish an argument for Terror superiority only amendable to disapproval by a Hopkins win.<br />\nJay Coach Alex Sour, seemingly impressed by Western Maryland's conquest of Randolph-Macon, supported the thesis of a Terror edge. \"The Randolph-Macon<br />\ncomparative scores show we've<br />\nreally got a tough game on our<br />\nhands Saturday,\" he said. \"Western Maryland should be favored;<br />\nI don't see how it could be put any<br />\nother way.\"<br />\nEvidence Ambiguous<br />\nFor all the above, though, the<br />\navailable evidence is far from completely favoring Western Maryland.<br />\nThe Westminster club's RandolphMacon triumph came the week after that team had - aided by a soso Jay performance and some<br />\nbreaks - taken Hopkins; and Randolph-Macon which hardly played<br />\nas well as it had the week before,<br />\nmay have been complacent after<br />\nthat victory. In both ball games<br />\nthe offensive statistics of the opposed teams were fairly equal. All<br />\nin all, tomorrow's game would<br />\nseem fairly close to a tossup; and in this writer's view - the edge goes<br />\nto Hopkins.<br />\nThe course of last Saturday's<br />\n52-6 Jay win over Dickinson can<br />\nbe fairly well outlined in terms of<br />\n(Continued on Page 9)<br /><br />\nHopkins Kickers Win<br />\nTwo Straight Matches<br />\nBy BOB HYAMS<br />\nThe varsity soccer team captured their sixth victory of the season<br />\nlast Tuesday as they defeated a<br />\npowerful but ineffective Western<br />\nMaryland squad by 2-1.<br />\nWestern Maryland scored in the<br />\nsecond period, but the Jays tied<br />\nthe score 1-1 as Wes Bachur scored<br />\nwith an assist from Roger Purdon.<br />\nThe winning goal was scored by<br />\nRandy Miller on a penalty kick in<br />\nthe third quarter.<br />\nOn Veteran's Day, November<br />\n11, for the first time. in twenty<br />\nyears, the Jays beat Drexel by a<br />\nscore of 3-1.

Bill Nhari tallied<br />\nDrexel's lone goal, while Ken Niman had an unassisted goal, and<br />\nArt Guerin scored with an assist<br />\nfrom Greg Sarav.<br />\nTuesday's win was Hopkins'<br />\nthird in a row, their fourth in the<br />\nlast five, and fifth in the last seven<br />\ngames. The team's overall record is<br />\n6-4, 5-2 in the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference, and 3-2 in the MasonDixon Conference.
