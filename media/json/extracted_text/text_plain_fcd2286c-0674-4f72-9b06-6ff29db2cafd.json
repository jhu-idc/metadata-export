LXXIV, No. 27<br />\n<br />\near<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Raises Rents: Blames Inflation<br />\nBy MIKE WEISSMAN<br />\nBlaming labor costs and inflation, the Administration announced Wednesday an effective rent increase of at least fifteen percent<br />\nfor all University housing.<br />\nMr. Marvin Kaberle, of the<br />\nOffice of Business Services, told<br />\nthe Student Affairs Committee<br />\nthat the residents of the Undergraduate Dormitories would suffer a fifteen percent raise in rent,<br />\nwhich would amount to $150.<br />\nThe increase is designed to counteract a 19.4 percent rise in University expenses projected for the<br />\nnext fiscal year.<br />\nThe increase in rents for the<br />\nGraduate facilities can be, kept<br />\ndown to five percent only by cutting off phone service. If the<br />\nswitchboards were continued, the<br />\ntotal rise in rent would be $96,200.<br />\nCommenting on the rent situation, President Gordon said that<br />\n\"there has been no decision to<br />\n<br />\nincrease the freshman class next<br />\nyear.\" He termed the 15% rent<br />\nincrease, \"Just a matter of cost.<br />\nWe have a policy that auxiliary<br />\nfacilities should run neither profit<br />\nor loss, because there is no money<br />\nto subsidize such facilities.\"<br />\nAlthough he accepted the existence of the deficit, Rich Conviser, a SAC member, questioned<br />\nthe principle of graduate housing.<br />\n\"The graduate students provide<br />\nthe University with research and<br />\nteaching, so why couldn't the University provide cheaper housing or<br />\na larger stipend?\" he asked.<br />\nDr. John White, Chairman<br />\nof both the SAC and the History<br />\nof Art Department, summed up<br />\nthe whole situation: \"The University is sliding and has suddenly<br />\nrealized how fast it is sliding, and<br />\nis now resorting to Draconian me,<br />\nthods.\"<br />\nThe SAC referred the housback to its housing subissue<br />\ning<br />\n(continued on page 5)<br />\n<br />\nGordon Resists<br />\nBy DAVID HOELSCHER<br />\nPresident Gordon, in response to proposals<br />\nset forth by the Committee for APL, stated<br />\nWednesday that attempts to halt all classified<br />\nresearch at the Applied Physics Laboratory are<br />\n\"absurd.\"<br />\n\"What concern does a Johns Hopkins student have with APL?\" he asked. Stating that<br />\nstudents should be involved with campus issues.<br />\nGordon indicated that if they want to protest<br />\nthey \"should try to get different Congressmen<br />\nelected.\"<br />\nGordon said that APL could not exist on<br />\ncampus. \"Fortunately,\" he noted, the APL is in<br />\nHoward County where its classified nature cannot interfere with the normal functioning of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nGordon noted that the Department of Defense, the sole contractor for the APL, would<br />\nnot accept a declassification of all projects.<br />\n\"The majority of important work done that's<br />\n\u2022important to the Department of Defense is<br />\nclassified,\" Gordon asserted. \"To declassify it<br />\nwould reduce its usefulness.\"<br />\nUnclassified\u2014Except for Details<br />\nWhile Gordon stated that the general projects at the Hopkins affiliated laboratory are not<br />\nclassified, \"the details are.\" Much of the work<br />\nrequires access to classified material, he explained.<br />\nGordon's remarks were in response to a set<br />\nof four proposals adopted by the Committee on<br />\nAPL Tuesday. These proposals are to be submitted to the Board of Trustees next week.<br />\nThe Committee has called for the Univer-<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee was informed Wednesday of Administration plans<br />\nfor an effective rent hike of at least fifteen per cent for all University housing.<br />\n<br />\nStudents Are Excluded<br />\nAPL Proposals From Any Involvement<br />\nIn Academic Council<br />\nsity to accept no more classified projects for<br />\nthe Laboratory and either to terminate or declassify all current projects. The Committee also<br />\nproposed to the trustees that a Citizens Committee be set up \"to formulate and implement a<br />\npolicy of converting the APL's research priorities<br />\nfrom military research to research in the areas of<br />\nenvironment, transportation, urban studies and<br />\nother social needs.\"<br />\nJim Keogh, co-organizer of the Committee<br />\nfor APL, indicated that Gordon's reaction did<br />\nnot concern him. \"Gordon, while perhaps an<br />\ninteresting example of social pathology, is really<br />\nirrelevent to the issue of APL. We expect that<br />\nthe decision will be made by the Board of<br />\nTrustees.\"<br />\n\"We're sure the Board of Trustees is concerned enough about our present national crises<br />\nthat they will respond affirmatively to our proposals,\" he added. \"We just cannot forsee a<br />\nnegative response.\"<br />\nA major portion of the debate over APL<br />\nhas centered around its usefulness, as a military<br />\nresearch complex, to the University. Gordon<br />\nstated that defense spending is \"the most cultural and costly problem to be reckoned with.\"<br />\nHe added that there has been no change in the<br />\nproblems and conditions facing the world since<br />\nWorld War II.<br />\nConstraints On Whom?<br />\nGordon noted, however, that APL places<br />\nsome constraints on the Universi6/. \"If it did<br />\nnot exist today and someone came to us and<br />\nasked that it be established, I think it unlikely<br />\nthat thapproach would be accepted.\" He said<br />\n(continued on page 11)<br />\n<br />\nBy MIKE MacADAMS<br />\nTheoretically an advisory board to the<br />\nPresident, the Academic Council is, in reality,<br />\nthe ruling force in \"all University academic<br />\nmatters\" both undergraduate and graduate.<br />\nAccording to President Gordon, Chairman of.<br />\nthe Council, \"the primary function of the Academic Council is the hiring and promotion of<br />\nprofessors\" above the assistant, professor level<br />\nas well as the granting of tenure.<br />\nThe President commented further that its<br />\n\"second most important purpose has to do with<br />\ndetermining the shape of the academic enterprise,\" specifically in the \"abolition, consolidation and establishment of departments.\"<br />\nIn addition to these ,matters, the Council<br />\nwas responsible for such recent decisions as coeducation, in 4-0-4 program, the elimination of<br />\nthe physical education and language degree requirements, the removal of ROTC from academic credit status and the creation of the Urban<br />\nAffairs Center.<br />\nLargely because of the extent to which the<br />\nCouncil affects the nature of the academic community, and the fact that its meetings are not<br />\nopen to non-members, faculty or student, many<br />\nlobservers have criticized it. According to Di.<br />\nlAchinstein of philosophy, member of the Council and the chairman of its subcommittee on the<br />\n\u2022 Humanities, the closure of the Council is., how\u2022<br />\never, necessary.<br />\nThis, he explained, was due .to the \"very<br />\n\u2022 personal and sometimes very embarrassing\" nature of the subjects discussed when faculty<br />\n(continued on page 2)<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nMarch 13, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nAcademic Body Explores Future School Development<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nare considered for appointment or promotion or when departments are subjected to general review and \"must be kept<br />\nstrictly confidential.\" These discussions, Achinstein went on to say, \"take<br />\nup the vast bulk of the meetings\".<br />\nThe situation is further exacerbated<br />\nby the restriction of eligibility for membership on the Council to senior faculty<br />\nmembers and the lack of some standing<br />\nvehicle for direct student input.<br />\nTo remedy the problem, an as yet<br />\ninformal movement has been gaining<br />\nmomentum within the Council to split<br />\nit into two bodies, one remaining closed<br />\nand dealing primarily with faculty membership and one composed of a more<br />\nrepresentative body of junior and senior<br />\nfaculty and students. One supporter of<br />\nthis plan, Associate Dean Strider,an exofficio member of the Council and chairman of its Graduate Board Subcommittee,<br />\nenvisioned the \"Non-academic Council\".<br />\nIt would be comprised of both students<br />\nand faculty and would have under its<br />\njurisdiction power over student discipline in academic matters as well as<br />\ncurricular<br />\nchanges<br />\nand proposals.<br />\nStrider further suggested that the establishment of a non-voting group common<br />\nto both of these parallel, but independent councils, which would allow for<br />\ncontinuity and act as a medium by which<br />\nideas could be exchanged between them.<br />\nIn addition to its routine review of<br />\nfaculty, the Academic Council is currently, according to President Gordon,<br />\ndevoting its energies to \"trying to develop some view of the core of what<br />\ngeneral things a university must have.\"<br />\nConvening last Tuesday night, The Council \"carried on a discussion of the university ten years hence.\"<br />\nDuring this meeting,projected appraisals of the various departments were<br />\npresented by the \"group planning coordinators\" from each of the departments. The purpose of this evaluation<br />\nwas to lay plans which would both avoid<br />\n<br />\nforseen problems in the near future<br />\nand allow for enough departmental flexibility to deal with those problems and<br />\ndevelopments<br />\nnot presently obvious<br />\nwhen they do arise. One such area<br />\nunder examination was the future of<br />\nthe Classics Department, most of whose<br />\nmembers are soon approaching retirement.. Also discussed was the matter<br />\nof the eventual size of the University,<br />\nboth student and faculty, and what facilities must be made available to handle<br />\n, the incoming women.<br />\nAll matters deemed within the jurisdiction of the Academic Council must<br />\nbe placed before it for review before<br />\nbeing submitted to the President and<br />\n<br />\nthe Board of Trustees for approval.<br />\nOrganizations<br />\nsuch as the General<br />\nAssembly or the Student Association<br />\n(or an individual student or faculty member) may prepare recommendations to<br />\nbe submitted to the Council by one of<br />\nits subcommittees.<br />\nEach one of these groups, however,<br />\ntheoretically presents its recommendations before the Council itself, but may<br />\nnot participate in Or witness any subsequent consideration or vote of the council on the proposal. In spite of all<br />\nthis secrecy, many of the members find<br />\nit an impressively effective system of<br />\nchecks and balances and approve of its<br />\nsmall and exclusive membership.<br />\n<br />\nMembers of the Academic Council<br />\n,are selected by general faculty election, two per year for five year terms.<br />\nIn addition the Council elects two additional members for one year terms to<br />\ninsure that all disciplines will be represented. These twelve faculty members<br />\nare franchised while the four man exofficio board (composed of Vice President Bevan and Deans Strider, Swanson<br />\nand Kimball) has no votes. The President and Chairman of the Council may<br />\nvote only in the event of a tie.

Because his primary<br />\ncommittment is to research, Dr. Rossi<br />\nchose to relinquish the chairmanship.<br />\nThe outgoing chairman refused to<br />\nspeculate on what changes might occur<br />\nIn his department as a result of his<br />\nresignation. He did, however, express<br />\nhope that the new chairman would be able<br />\nto devote himself more fully to the tasks<br />\n<br />\nRubeo said that with the classes donating money, and through appeals to parents, the yearbook hoped to defray its<br />\nexpenses. Yet Adams said that what will<br />\nmost affect the financial situation of the<br />\nyearbook is the response received from<br />\nthe advertisers.\"<br />\nThe Hullabaloo has had a few other<br />\nminor problems. Photographer John<br />\nEgan decided to take the semester off<br />\nwhile he had the chance.<br />\nThe other problem is that only about<br />\n50% of the usual number of seniors who<br />\nhave their photos taken for the yearbook<br />\nhave as yet done so. Adams emphasized<br />\nthat any senior who desires to have his<br />\npicture taken for the year book can do so<br />\nby going to Hutzlers department store.<br />\n<br />\nstudent keep a journal, recording his<br />\nreactions to the readings.

Stated Rossi, \"I suspect that with anew chairman the department will be better administered.\"<br />\n<br />\nDenies Pressure<br />\nRossi denied that pressure or opposition from within the department had<br />\nbrought about his resignation. However,<br />\nhe said that \"it was more than a personal<br />\ndecision.\" He did not elaborate on his<br />\nstatement.<br />\nRossi emphasized that his resignation has not been accepted and is in no<br />\nway \"formalized\". If the department's<br />\nsearch for a new chairman is not successful, he would be willing to continue<br />\nin that capacity through next year, rather than step down at the conclusion of<br />\nthe spring term.<br />\nAccording to Rossi, the department<br />\nhas not yet begun to look for his successor. He does not intend to participate<br />\nin the search, stating that \"I would prefer not to have a hand in choosing my<br />\nown successor.\"<br />\n<br />\nPeriod Expansion<br />\n<br />\nSocial Relations Peter Rossi tentatively resigned this week as department chairman<br />\nciting \"personal reasons.\"<br />\n<br />\nHis term as chairman, noted Rossi,<br />\nwas \"a period of expansion\" for the department. During his term the department was transformed from small to<br />\nmedium size.<br />\nHe also claimed that the Social Relations Department was \"the leading department in giving graduate students a<br />\nsay in the department.\"<br />\nFuture plans for the department, revealed Rossi, include giving \"increasing attention to undergraduate education.\" He mentioned that \"and intellectually respectable introductory course\"<br />\nin Sociology was being developed for<br />\nnext year.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMarch 13, 1970<br />\n<br />\n'Chester Wickwire is for Real\u2014So Much Soul'<br />\nBy HARVEY LUKSENBURG<br />\nDuring his seventeen years at Hopkins,<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire, Chaplain of the<br />\nUniversity, has played a dominant role<br />\nIn the struggle for civil rights in the city,<br />\nthe state, perhaps the country.<br />\nHe has run the gauntlet which all fervent advocates of unpopular cases face:<br />\naspiration, defeat, arrest, work, partial<br />\nvictory.<br />\nTo the majority of Hopkins students,<br />\nhe is a figure. To the leaders of Baltimore's black community, he is a major<br />\nfigure.<br />\nDr. Wickwire's career at Hopkins began in 1953. He soon engaged himself<br />\nin the various demonstations that were<br />\nthen starting to crack Baltimore's hitherto placid racial status quo. In the late<br />\nfifties he participated in an attempt to<br />\nintegrate the Northwood Theatre, near<br />\nMorgan State College. He also aided in<br />\nefforts to desegregate facilities at Ocean<br />\nCity, Maryland.<br />\n<br />\nOther Jazz<br />\nIn 1959, under the aegis of the YMCA,<br />\n(which then ran the Chaplain's Office<br />\nand the Student Association) Wickwire<br />\nand others organized one of the city's<br />\nfirst major concerts open to both blacks<br />\nand whites. The concert, held in the Fifth<br />\nRegiment Armory and starring Dave<br />\nBrubeck, Chico Hammerton and other<br />\njazz artists, did not develop into the riotous chaos that many thought it would.<br />\nDr. Wickwire said that the event that<br />\nmost inspired him to continue in civil<br />\nrights occured in 1961, when, during a<br />\nvisit to the Soviet Union with a group of<br />\nstudents, he was accused(falsely)of distributing anti-Soviet propaganda. The<br />\ngroup was put on trial, and acquitted,<br />\nbut Dr. Wickwire was impressed by the<br />\nexperience. \"I came back to America<br />\nfeeling that I wanted to do everything<br />\npossible to do away with every kind of<br />\nsecond-class citizenship.\" In Baltimore,<br />\nthe chances for this sort of opportunity<br />\ngrows on trees.<br />\n<br />\nagainst Gwynn Oak's no-black policy.<br />\nReverend Vernon Dobson, minister of<br />\nthe Union Baptist Church and President<br />\nof the Interdenominational Ministerial<br />\nAlliance, described the civil-rightists'<br />\nnet move: \"We figured that July 4,<br />\n1963 would be a good day to attempt to<br />\ndesergregate. We took thousands of people down to prepare for a mass arrest,<br />\nincluding some members of national civil<br />\nrights organizations. What followed was<br />\nthe largest arrest of clergy ever at one<br />\ntime.\"<br />\nDr. Wickwire spent a few days in jail.<br />\nAmong those who were confined with him<br />\nwas Michael Schwerner, a civil rights<br />\nworker, who, with two others, a year<br />\nlater would be found mysterious1:: murdered in Philadelphia, Mississippi.<br />\nGeorge Wallace entered the Maryland<br />\nPresidential primary against Daniel Brewster in 1964. Wickwire became active<br />\nin the \"Stop Wallace\" Committee which<br />\nbrought up \"truth squads\" of civil rights<br />\nworkers from Alabama to help inform<br />\nBaltimore Voters concerning the Wallace<br />\nthreat via rallies at major churches.<br />\nVery Accommodating<br />\nAlso in 1964, he became co-chairman<br />\nof the Statewide committee to Uphold the<br />\n<br />\nHomewood Bound<br />\nAt the same time, Chaplain Wickwire<br />\nwas working within the Hopkins community to improve conditions for blacks.<br />\nTogether with a group of graduate students, he tried to persuade the University to open up its admissions policy<br />\nso as to admit more blacks. They also<br />\nencouraged the employment of more<br />\nblack help. The University's policy of<br />\nhaving two separate housing lists, one<br />\nfor whites and one for blacks, was eliminated.<br />\nWithin the last few years, Dr. Wickwire has concentrated more on the housing situation. He has sat on realtor's<br />\nboards and has tried to hit them to change<br />\ntheir discriminatory codes of ethics.<br />\nLittle progress, however, has been made<br />\nin this field. \"It is still very difficult<br />\nfor blacks to get out of the inner city<br />\ninto the county,\" says Dr. Wickwir<br />\ne.<br />\n<br />\nJuly 4, 1963<br />\nBlatantly;racist Gwynn Oak Amusement<br />\nPark became the target for Baltimore<br />\ncivil rights activists in 1962 and<br />\n1963.<br />\nAs a member of the Gwynn Oak Park<br />\nCitizens Committee, Dr. Wickwire became the first clergyman to take a stand<br />\n<br />\nPublic Accommodations Law. This law<br />\nwas to be put to a referendum in the forthcoming election. If approved, all Maryland public accommodations would be<br />\nforced to submit to desegregation. A prosegregation group, the Maryland Petition<br />\nCommittee, produced a petition with<br />\ntwenty thousand signatures opposing the<br />\nreferendum. Wickwire's committee then<br />\nlaunched into a counteractive project<br />\nthat was determined to prove that many<br />\nof the petition's signatures were forged,<br />\nrendering it invalid. Working out of Levering Hall almost around the clock<br />\nthroughout the summer,using computers,<br />\nhandwriting analysts and trained aides<br />\nwho scoured voter registration files,<br />\ncomparing signatures, enough evidence<br />\nwas accumulated to prove the petition<br />\nwas definitely a forgery. The public accommodations law won at the polls.<br />\nWalter Carter, whom Wickwire calls<br />\n\"the most important man in civil rights<br />\nin the state of Maryland,\" commented<br />\nthat: \"Chester Wickwire was the one<br />\nman most responsible for segregation's<br />\ndefeat in 1964. What he did had tremendous positive implications in the nation.<br />\nThe fact that we won encouraged the<br />\nFederal Government to pass the Civil<br />\nRights Act.\"<br />\n<br />\nBoo Agnew<br />\nUniversity Chaplain Chester Wickwire, cited<br />\nby Baltimore black leaders as a \"major figure\"<br />\nin the local civil rights struggle.photo by lemm<br />\n<br />\nIn 1968, after violent disturbances<br />\naccompanying Dr. King's assassination,<br />\nthen-Governor Agnew gave a \"vitriolic\"<br />\n<br />\nspeech condemning moderate black leaders. Wickwire, as part of the Committee<br />\nfor Responsible Leadership helped to<br />\nraise money to place a full-page ad in the<br />\nBaltimore News-American (The Sun refused to run it) that answered Agnew's<br />\n'accusations and was signed by prominent<br />\nmembers of the white community.<br />\nDuring the same year, RESPONSE<br />\nendeavored to educate concerned Baltimore community leaders on what could<br />\nbe done to change their attitudes and behaviour<br />\ntowards the problems of the<br />\nurban environment.<br />\nNowadays, Dr. Wickwire is still involved in a number of community-oriented projects. Most successful is the tutoring program, which was initiated in 1963<br />\nto aid the education of black children<br />\nliving in the area of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital. There is a group of \"court<br />\nwatchers\"--students who are trained<br />\nto look for irregularities in the \"justice\"<br />\nmeted out to blacks by the city's lower<br />\ncourts.<br />\n<br />\nFriend Of Panthers<br />\nWickwire has also been keeping in<br />\ntouch with the Baltimore Black Panther<br />\nParty by trying to serve as mediators<br />\nbetween them and the community.He has<br />\ncome to their aid once already, when he<br />\nraised money to pay their gas and electric<br />\nbill.<br />\n\"Conditions in Baltimore have improved--but there is a long way to go. Much<br />\nwork must be done in education,housing,<br />\nand employment,\" Wickwire surmises.<br />\nBlack leaders in Baltimore agree that<br />\nwhat progress has been made owes much<br />\nto Chester Wickwire. Reverend Marion<br />\nBascom, minister of the Douglas Memorial Community Church says that,<br />\n\"Dr. Wickwire is one of the few white<br />\nmen in Baltimore who has the unqualified<br />\nand unequivocal trust of the black community. So far as knowledgable black<br />\npeople are concerned--Chester Wickwire<br />\nis for real. In terms of participation, he<br />\ncan exercise more freedom of action<br />\nthan any member of the white community.\"<br />\nWalter Carter: \"...his involvement<br />\nhas never stopped.

However, the petition<br />\ndeals with the broader problems<br />\nof University priorities and student power in decision making.<br />\nAt the heart of the complaint<br />\nis the fact that graduate stipends<br />\nare fixed while housing costs<br />\ncontinue to rise.

The<br />\neighty six signers of the petition<br />\naccused the University of' attempting \"to wrest itself from<br />\nIts financial problems at the<br />\nexpense of those least able to<br />\nbear the burden.\"<br />\nThe petition was presented<br />\nMonday night at a meeting called by graduate students Bob Cotter of Biophysics and Ray Copson of Political Science. The<br />\nconference, held in the lobby of<br />\nMcCoy Hall, was called to discuss the strategy for a rent strike<br />\nby dorm residents in protest over<br />\nthe in Tease in rent.<br />\nThe petition, two pages in length, is explicit in its condemnation of the Administration. The<br />\nCommittee on Housing, which is<br />\nsupposed to make student concerns known to the administration<br />\nhas been consulted only on the<br />\nmatter of which rooms in McCoy<br />\nWill be used for the undergraduate women.

There research could be done on<br />\npossible alternatives to the rent increase. Another<br />\npossible task for the Housing subcommittee may<br />\nbe to mediate the rent strike proposed by the graduate students.<br />\n<br />\nThree Plans<br />\nThe University has presented three plans for<br />\nminimizing the telephone charge for graduate<br />\nstudents. The first suggestion is to allow them<br />\nto make only local calls through the Hopkins<br />\nswitchboard. This would be slightly less expensive<br />\nthan the present system. Pay phones in the halls<br />\nIs the second suggestion.<br />\nThe final idea would involve individual arrangements with the phone company. For $8.10 per<br />\nmonth a student could have a black, single party,<br />\n<br />\neYo<br />\n<br />\ndialing phone, and unlimited calls. A two-party<br />\neconomy phone would cost $3.95 per month and<br />\n5.9C per call.<br />\nThe housing of female undergraduates was another of the questions confronting the committee.<br />\nWhen asked later about the number of girls to be<br />\nhoused in McCoy Hall, Mr. Kaberle said, \"I can't<br />\n'seem to find any solid figure. I wish I knew; it<br />\nwould make planning easier.\"<br />\nCoeds will probably be placed in singles, but<br />\nthere are suggestions to put them in apartments<br />\nor doubles.

Let me tell<br />\nyou a true story about someone I once<br />\nknew. For the sake of a little contrived<br />\nirony let's call him after my middle<br />\nname, Lawrence; Larry, for short.<br />\n<br />\nCherry Smash Bottles<br />\nLarry comes from a good liberal family; his father studied physics under<br />\nErwin Schrodinger. Larry came to Hopkins to study physics; he was politically<br />\nradical, an intellectual, with a broad<br />\nstreak of the surrealistic in his head-he had a large collection of Cherry Smash<br />\nbottles and his own religion, based on<br />\nhis interpretation of the prophesies of<br />\nthe angel Moroni. He had the usual complaints about Hopkins, lousy food, lousy<br />\ndorms, lousy graduate instructors, and<br />\nwhy have grades since they mean so<br />\nlittle? But trips to Druid Hill Park and<br />\nvarious radical activities make Hopkins<br />\na tolerable place.<br />\nHe moved off campus his second year<br />\nand became involved in the drug scene.<br />\nHe left school for a while and worked<br />\nas a weather observer in Alaska and did<br />\nfield labor in California.<br />\nWhen he came back to school he went<br />\nback into the drug business and put up<br />\ntransient freaks. He also started to sell<br />\nstolen records,some from D.C. and some<br />\nhe personally liberated from the Book-<br />\n<br />\nBenzon<br />\n<br />\nstore. Eventually someone in the Bookstore chose to notice his activities and<br />\nhe received a two week suspension (apparently no one had any notion of the extent of his activities) which he spent<br />\nshoveling shit and pitching hay on a farm.<br />\nWhen he got back to Hopkins he turned<br />\nhis unmasking to advantage, and served<br />\nas a decoy for other thieves.<br />\n<br />\nLavender Fire Hydrant<br />\nMeanwhile he had managed to steal<br />\na law and order club out of the car of<br />\nOne of Baltimore's Finest (unnoticed)<br />\nand to paint a fire hydrant lavender-which was noticed; he had to remove the<br />\npaint. He told me that the Blue Meanies<br />\nwere moving in--he is right, of course.<br />\nHe also had an interest in color; he<br />\nbought a set of plastic light filters and<br />\ncut them to fit his glasses so that he could<br />\nstudy the affective tonality of a color by<br />\nlooking at the world through that color.<br />\nWith some friends of his to help, he liberated a number of overhead projectors<br />\nand slide projectors from the University<br />\nso that he could experiment with light<br />\nand make light shows. He felt he could<br />\nput the equipment to better use that the<br />\nUniversity did--he had no intention of<br />\nfencing the stuff.<br />\nWell, he's left Hopkins (though I think<br />\nhe got a degree in Psychology), a longhaired social outcast, and split for California on the money he made from his<br />\nvarious enterprises-- I don't know whether or not he made it, but I hope so.<br />\nNot because I think that California is a<br />\nParadise, but simply because that's what<br />\nhe wanted to do (as opposed to what<br />\nsomeone else thought would be good for<br />\nhim.)<br />\nNot being unreasonable, I'm not going<br />\nto try saddling Hopkins with the entire<br />\nresponsibility for this everyday tragedy,<br />\nThe University can't be held accountable<br />\nfor the Nation. But it can be held accountable for its own community. And that<br />\naccount is a pretty grim one.<br />\n<br />\nExtensive Ignorance<br />\nI can't help but believe that if Hopkins<br />\nwhere a genuine community of free men<br />\nand scholars (rather than a feed bin for<br />\nthe economy) it wouldn't have overlooked Larry, put him off by denying him a<br />\nstake in his own life.

The act of refusing<br />\ninduction is illegal. By signing the petition a person has not committed himself<br />\nto any specific method of avoiding the<br />\ndraft.He may use any number of legal<br />\nstrategies as well as apply for a C.O.<br />\nIn conversations with ACLU attorney<br />\nWilliam Zinman, the legal staff of the<br />\nNational Moratorium Committee and<br />\nother attorneys, the only question of<br />\nillegality involves those who solicit signatures. Here the charge would be conspiracy to violate the draft law. Since<br />\nthe petition allows the person the option<br />\nof not serving by means of legal action,<br />\nthese lawyers assure me that any potential Justice Department case would be a<br />\nvery weak one.<br />\nSecondly, I do not \"head\" the Hopkins<br />\nPeace Action Committee. .Christopher<br />\n<br />\nOhly and David Charry are Larry Goldberg's successors as campus co-ordinators. My role in the last few weeks<br />\nhas been in an advisory capacity, acquainting Chris and David with the various programs and personnel of the various local and national peace groups.<br />\nWhen it was recognized that publicity was<br />\nneeded for the \"We Won't Go\" petition,<br />\nDavid and Chris asked me to contact the<br />\nNews-Letter and give a summary of the<br />\nMoratorium, Mobe, Resist etc. Spring<br />\nactivities and suggest their implication<br />\nfor Baltimore and Hopkins. Since no<br />\npolicies are decided by the Hopkins Peace<br />\nAction Committee except in open meeting by show of hands and since I am not<br />\nthe \"head\" of the organization, I felt<br />\nthat the only appropriate news release<br />\nshould include the major strategies of the<br />\nvarious national organizations and the<br />\nirationale behind those policies.<br />\nI was therefore, very annoyed to find<br />\nthe News-Letter article stating that the<br />\nHopkins Peace Action Committee had<br />\nalready accepted tactics which I simply<br />\nmentioned as possible plans of various<br />\nnational organizations and groups in<br />\nother cities. I was also very much disturbed by the implication that I personally called for the adoption of certain strategies and that I would be the leader in<br />\nimplementing them.<br />\n(continued on page 7)<br />\n<br />\n\fLetters To The Editors<br />\n(continued from page 6)<br />\nIn speaking to the News-Letter reporter (incidentally, I was only contacted<br />\nover the telephone; never approached<br />\npersonally) I repeatedly emphasized that<br />\nI was simply reviewing proposed actions.<br />\nI can therefore, only conclude that in the<br />\npreparation of the article the various<br />\nproposals were incoherently synthesized<br />\nand that the incoherent result was put<br />\nforth as the policy of the Hopkins Peace<br />\nAction Committee and credited to me<br />\npersonally. I would like to cite an example<br />\nof this type of synthesis. Midway in the<br />\narticle this sentence appeared<br />\nWith good organization, Lipman said,<br />\nenough pressure can be exerted to<br />\n\"cripple\" the Selective Service System and perhaps \"force Nixon into a<br />\ncorner.\"<br />\nThis statement appears to be a handily<br />\nedited combination of two totally different<br />\nstatements.<br />\n1) Various groups feel it is possible<br />\nto cripple the Selective Service system by massive civil disobedience.<br />\n2) With good enough grass roots organization others feel enough people<br />\ncan be made aware of the fallacies<br />\nof the Vietnamization policy. These<br />\npeople in coalition with already existing anti-war elements can force Nixon<br />\ninto a political corner.<br />\nDue to this and other misquotations<br />\nappearing in the article I feel it is necessary for me to articulate my own preferences for further anti-war activities.<br />\nI feel that while the majority of Americans can not be \"radicalized,\" they<br />\ncan be made aware of the need for Immediate Withdrawal, sharply reduced<br />\ndefense spending, and the end of the draft<br />\nsystem, given the acceptability of the<br />\npeace movement. By acceptability I mean<br />\nthe ability of the majority to incorporate<br />\nanti-war sentiment into their conceptual<br />\nframework of the \"givens of America\".<br />\nIn other words, I feel that in order to<br />\nachieve these three specific goals, the<br />\nanti-war movement must avoid actions<br />\nthat would alienate the greater numbers<br />\nof Americans. Disruption at Draft Centers is one of thse activities.It is logically impossible for us to cripple the Selective Service system without incurring<br />\nrepression which I feel the majority of<br />\nAmericans would support. What we must<br />\ndo is reach enough people to make it<br />\npolitically necessary for a self-seeking<br />\npolitician to support immediate withdrawal, reduce defense spending, and<br />\nend the draft.<br />\nWhile many consider this pragmatic<br />\nstance co-option, I feel it is the only<br />\n<br />\nway we can end the killing.<br />\n<br />\nGeorge M.

Besides inconveniencing the football banquet, the rescheduled<br />\nexams overlapped three basketball<br />\ngames, one swim meet, and two wrestling matches. This forced many to compete on even the same day they took exams.<br />\nMost of these athletes had no choice but<br />\nto return to Hopkins on Jan. 5. For this<br />\ninconvenience, upperclassmen had to<br />\nsupport their own food requirements<br />\nwhile being mostly for athletic reasons.<br />\nThe<br />\ndidn't supplement<br />\nuniversity<br />\nSaga's funds and extension of service<br />\nwith no new money had a telling effect on<br />\nthe food freshmen tried to live on. For<br />\nall of this, the meets were witnessed<br />\nby capacity crowds as high as even fifteen. The intersession was detrimental<br />\nto a large percentage of those who had to<br />\ntake part in it.<br />\nI can only say what effect this had on<br />\none sport. I know that these circumstances were instrumental in a very poor<br />\nturnout for the wrestling squads. It was<br />\nthe inability to fill the weight classes<br />\nthat ruined Hopkins' previously improving record.<br />\nI hope that in future programs, more<br />\nconcern for the consequences of all involved will result in more harmonious<br />\nresults.<br />\n<br />\nKeith Gordon<br />\nClass of'73<br />\nTHE STUDENT WHAT?<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nGovernance.

They feel<br />\nthat a particular course would be beneficial to them yet a department isn't interested, even though there are enough<br />\nto make a class. Their education goes<br />\nlacking or they also leave the campus,<br />\nnever to return.<br />\nShould leaving be the only alternative<br />\nto a bad situation? Shouldn't Hopkins try<br />\nto keep its best minds that refuse to put<br />\nup with the run-around? Or is the University leadership intent on a sprialling<br />\nmediocrity, the end being a university<br />\nof only fairly intelligent people?<br />\nMost complainants wish to help change<br />\nthe University negligence of their problems, yet when they attempt to articulate an interest, either there is no place<br />\nto express it or that expression seems<br />\nto die in a committee somewhere. What<br />\nthey are looking for is a representative<br />\nbody that will consider their particular<br />\nproblems and attempt a solution.

WON'T GO<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nBeing registered as a C.O., I am as<br />\nmuch opposed tothe draft system and to<br />\nwar in general as any one on campus. It<br />\nis for this reason that I have absolutely<br />\nno argument with the writers of several<br />\narticles and letters in your March 6th<br />\nedition concerning the nature of the war<br />\nin Vietnam and the immorallity of the<br />\ncurrent system of military conscription.<br />\nBecause I am morally opposed to violence in any form (as a traditional religious pacifist), however, I find myself<br />\ndiametrically opposed to the current<br />\ntactics of such organizations as New<br />\nMobe and the Peace Action Committee.<br />\nAlthough these organizations do not<br />\nappear violent under ordinary standards,<br />\nmy stipulated definition of \"violent\"<br />\nincludes violence in word and thought,<br />\nas well as in deed. I, therefore, consider the actions of these organizations<br />\nviolent, in that they promote polarization<br />\nthan reconciliation, alienation<br />\nrather<br />\nrather than association, and separation<br />\nrather than the unification of individuals<br />\nin brotherhood. Thus, through the use of<br />\nsuch confronatation tactics as the \"We<br />\nWon't Go\" petition, more is being done<br />\nto divide mankind than to unite it. Since I<br />\nam a firm believer in non-violence, I<br />\ncannot justify these confronting actions<br />\non the grounds that they are not truly<br />\nnon-violent, in the deepest sense of the<br />\nword.<br />\n<br />\nAPL FILM FLAM<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI happened to notice in a recent edition<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Newsletter that<br />\npeople are finally getting interested in<br />\nwhat the Applied Physics Lab is all about.<br />\nA.P.L. itself has a 30-minute(approx.)<br />\nfilm called the \"Applied Physics Lab<br />\nStory\" which is really worth seeing.<br />\nA.P.L. has been making this film available for public viewing, meetings. etc.<br />\nThis writer saw it at a \"science\" fair<br />\nat the Civic Center a couple of years<br />\nago.<br />\nI would suggest to people who would<br />\nlike to know what the A.P.L. is up to,<br />\nstraight from the horse's mouth (so to<br />\nspeak), to get hold of that film for a<br />\n<br />\nDue to the fact that I am a<br />\nI find myself between those who oppose<br />\nwar as I do, but resort to confrontation,<br />\non the one hand; and those who do neither,<br />\non the other hand.

His intention is to have the other three<br />\nclasses reimburse the juniors with $100 each in order to even out the<br />\ndistribution of the donation among all four classes. Although there is<br />\nno responsibility for the other classes' officers to back Wolk up,<br />\nwe strongly recommend that they do simply to present a united front<br />\nto the Administration. The University has been delinquent in assuming its responsibility for paying the swimmers' way to the<br />\nNCAA's.<br />\nAfter having strained and sacrificed for an entire season, the swimmers are put upon by the administration to sacrifice an extra day of<br />\nclasses in order to make the trip by car rather than by plane. Who do<br />\nwe thank up there in the administration for this imposition on an athlete as a conscientious student?<br />\nPerhaps, and maybe rightfully so, the blame can stop with Director<br />\nof Student Affairs, Robert Bilgrave, who has remained mysteriously<br />\nquiet throughout the swimming team's crisis. Last year Bilgrave's<br />\noffice gave $200 towards the swimmers' trip to Springfield, Mass,<br />\nfor the NCAA's. This year he can only afford in the vicinity of $50.<br />\nThis is but one of many examples where our penny-wise and poundfoolish Administration is forcing the students to fend for themselves.<br />\nLarry Wolk's laudable action proves that the students really do care.<br />\nPerhaps, our past cynicism has been created by an unresponsive<br />\nAdministration.<br />\nIndications come from David Kaufman's Office that there will not<br />\nbe need to repeat the swimmers'search for money to go to the NCAA's<br />\nnext year. It is still not too late for those Administrators to donate<br />\nthe extra money for the swimmers to fly. How about it? We've done<br />\nmore than our share in meeting them halfway.<br />\nAthletes do more than just represent Hopkins undergraduates-they represent the entire university. It is high time that our administrators do more than just represent their own rung on \"Lincoln's<br />\nladder.\" Some already do \"stand up to be counted,\" to borrow Coach<br />\nSotir's phrase.<br />\nNow, not next year, is the time to show the undergraduates that<br />\nsense of caring for OUR HOPKINS is not just hollow words within<br />\nour hallowed walls. There need not and should not be a discrepancy<br />\nbetween student and administration concern.<br />\nSwimmers are providing the cars and drivers to make the trip to<br />\nMichigan. Swimmers spent literally over 100 hours lifeguarding at the<br />\npool to raise money to go to the NCAA's. Students raised 98.4% of.<br />\nthe money to finance the trip. Nowhere does one see the word administration. As my parting shot, I ask, \"How come?\"<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\n<br />\nBriefs<br />\n<br />\nFrosh Diamond Tryouts<br />\nFreshman wishing to try out for the freshman baseball team should<br />\nreport to the baseball diamond behind the snack bar on this coming<br />\nMonday at 4:30 p.m. If it rains or snows, practice will be held in the<br />\ngymnasium.

On March 21, the team takes on Yale<br />\nUniversity, to open the 1970 season. The Blue Jays<br />\nare long-shot contenders for the national title this<br />\nyear. The favorite is considered to be the Military<br />\nAcademy at West Point.<br />\n<br />\nCoker Leads Squad<br />\nHopkins will be led by senior All American<br />\nCharlie Coker, the top scorer last year. Coker<br />\nwill be joined at the mid-field spot by co-captain<br />\nDoug Honig and junior Bill Donovan. Both Honig<br />\nand Donovan are lettermen from last year.<br />\nThe second line mid-field unit will consist of<br />\nco-captain Russ Moore, junior Doug Fuchs and<br />\nsophomore Gary Handleman. The middies have<br />\nbeen the unlucky group so far as both Honig, who<br />\nhas a muscle pull, and Handleman, who separated<br />\nhis shoulder during the scrimmage with the Maryland Lacrosse Club, are injured. Fuchs will be<br />\nready for the Yale game, but Handleman is still a<br />\nquestion mark.<br />\nJuniors Jim Grenafege, Bob Duncan,and Wayne<br />\nWoodward compose the third middle unit. Sophomores Dave Nelz and Bob Kelley offer support<br />\nand competition for spots in the third unit.<br />\n<br />\nInjuries Hurt<br />\nBecause of the pre-season injuries to Honig<br />\nand Handleman, Bob Pfeifer and Pat Pilachowski,<br />\nwho normally play attack, have been practicing<br />\nwith the midfield. Pfeifer, who is also quarterback<br />\nfor the football team, lettered last year.<br />\nDefensively, Paul Weiss, a third team AllAmerican, is the only returning starter from last<br />\nyear's club as Mike Clark and John Cardillo have<br />\nboth graduated. Bob MacCool, who played for Mt.<br />\nWashington last year will be the second starting<br />\ndefensiveman with Joe Cieslowski and Larry<br />\nTeitel battling for the third spot.<br />\nDoug Hein is a highly competent replacement for<br />\nany of the three defensemen. Also, Coach Scott<br />\nexpects the continued improvement of sophomores<br />\n<br />\nStu Kahl a letterman from last year will lead<br />\nthe crease attackmen. However, graduation has<br />\nalso affected this unit as three time All-American<br />\nJoe Cowan and Jim Feely have graduated. Cowan<br />\nis the all-time leading scorer of the Hopkins Lacrosse team.<br />\nThis year, the two other attack positions will<br />\nbe manned by Dan Hall and Paul Wallace. Hall<br />\ncame on strongly at last year's finish with two<br />\ngoals and an assist against Maryland. Wallace<br />\nwas one of the top scorers of last year's freshmen<br />\nclub. Jay Hanas will lend support to Hall's and<br />\nWallace's position behind the goal. Bill Barton<br />\nwill play behind creaseman Stu Kahl. John<br />\n\"Weedy\" Hammond offers additional support at<br />\nthe crease position.<br />\nThere is an interesting battle being waged for<br />\nthe goalie position. Junior Kenney Dauses will<br />\nget the starting nod in the opening game with<br />\nYale, but senior Peter Conti, who has not played<br />\nlacrosse since his freshmen year, will keep the<br />\npressure on Dauses. The keen competition, should<br />\nmake the starting goalie play a better game.<br />\n<br />\nElis Pose Threat<br />\nYale should prove to be a strong test in the<br />\nhome opener. The Elis recently lost to the Long<br />\nIsland Lacrosse Club, the strongest club team<br />\nof last year, by the score of 9 to 4. Yale has a<br />\nfine goalie and two good sophomore attackmen.<br />\nThe Blue Jays did lose seven of ten starters<br />\nlast year. But as Coach Scott stated, it's a new<br />\nyear, with a new group. The team is anxious<br />\nto play and works very hard in practice. They<br />\nare a club determined to play well, to strive to<br />\ncontinue Hopkins'winning lacrosse tradition. This<br />\ndetermination represents a minimumization of<br />\nmistakes and a continued game hustle. A winning<br />\nspirit encompasses the entire team and its<br />\ncoaches. The team realizes the task before it,<br />\nand every effort will be made to achieve it.<br />\nIn a preseason scrimmage, the Jays lost 14-8<br />\nto the Maryland Lacrosse Club.

Kuntsler contends<br />\nthat it is impossible to have a fair trial<br />\nin the over-whelmingly white, rural, and<br />\nconservative Harford County. Cambridge, nearly 100 miles away, is onethird black.<br />\nBrown's friend, Ralph Featherstone,<br />\nand an unidentified black man, were<br />\nkilled late Monday night as a powerful<br />\nexplosive device shattered their car on<br />\nthe outskirts of Bel Air. Initially, there<br />\nwas some fear that the unknown dead<br />\npassenger might be H. Rap Brown, but<br />\na medical examination proved otherwise.<br />\nThe real controversy, though, centered on where the explosives came from<br />\nState Police officials said that the explosive device was being carried in the<br />\ncar and that it was apparently resting<br />\n<br />\non the floor between the feet of the<br />\nunidentified passenger. Judge Dyer himself inspected the remnants of the car,<br />\nand he later told reporters that he believed the explosive device went off accidentally in the car.<br />\nKuntsler, along with some of Maryland's black leaders, was not so sure<br />\nthat Featherstone and his companion<br />\nwere carrying explosives.<br />\nKuntsler<br />\nsaid he had known Featherstone for<br />\nyears, and, he added, \"I don't think<br />\nthat sort of thing was Ralph Featherstone's bag.\"<br />\n<br />\ntion, but adjourned the hearings until<br />\nMonday.<br />\nOn Tuesday night, an unused courthouse in Cambridge was rocked by explosives allegedly planted in a bathroom<br />\non the second floor. Governor Mandel<br />\nvisited the scene to determine the extent of the damage.<br />\n<br />\nThe. jury has not been selected yet,'<br />\nand H. Rap Brown's presence is not<br />\nrequired until jury selection begins next<br />\nweek.<br />\nKuntsler intends to challenge<br />\nthe jury as unrepresentative of the<br />\ncommunity, and prejudiced. He intends<br />\nto ask prospective jurors questions like,<br />\n\"Do you know what a dashiki is.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe black leaders hinted that State<br />\nPolice white-washed the investigation,<br />\nand that the car had been ambushed by<br />\nright-wing extremists.<br />\nWalter Lively, former executive director of the Urban Coalition of Baltimore, and Clarence Davis, of Aberdeen,<br />\nsaid that the investigation had barely<br />\nstarted before the police had announced that the explosive device was carried on the floor of the car.<br />\nMr. Lively charged, \"The men would<br />\nhave had to be fools to allow it to explode accidently.\" In addition, Davis<br />\nand Lively said that the marks of a<br />\ntire skid behind the explosive site indicated that another car had hurled explosives at the Featherstone car. They<br />\nfelt that the attack had been carried out<br />\nby \"Birchers or the Klan.\"<br />\n<br />\nWitnesses<br />\nThe State Police said they had found<br />\ntwo witnesses to the explosion, and that<br />\nthe only other car on the road was driven by one of the witnesses. The blast<br />\noccurred about a mile north of the State<br />\nPolice barracks.<br />\nKuntsler demanded an indefinite adjournment of the pretrial hearings, because, he said, the community was so<br />\naroused that a fair trial was impossible.<br />\nThe judge rejected Kuntsler's conten-<br />\n<br />\nH.

In every case, the points in question have been confined<br />\nmerely to how a given policy would be carried out in practice. The determination of these policies, however, has thus far been totally out of the<br />\nhands of the university's students.<br />\nThis is why the Graduate Student Organization, in the spirit of the Free<br />\n'University's pioneering work, is sponsoring an open seminar to examine the<br />\npurpose of the university and the implications of this purpose on how the<br />\nuniversity should be governed.<br />\n<br />\nGarrett Room ,M.S.E.

If the<br />\nswitchboards were continued, the<br />\ntotal rise in rent would be $96,200.<br />\nCommenting on the rent situation, President Gordon said that<br />\n\"there has been no decision to<br /><br />\nincrease the freshman class next<br />\nyear.\" He termed the 15% rent<br />\nincrease, \"Just a matter of cost.<br />\nWe have a policy that auxiliary<br />\nfacilities should run neither profit<br />\nor loss, because there is no money<br />\nto subsidize such facilities.\"<br />\nAlthough he accepted the existence of the deficit, Rich Conviser, a SAC member, questioned<br />\nthe principle of graduate housing.<br />\n\"The graduate students provide<br />\nthe University with research and<br />\nteaching, so why couldn't the University provide cheaper housing or<br />\na larger stipend?\" he asked.<br />\nDr. John White, Chairman<br />\nof both the SAC and the History<br />\nof Art Department, summed up<br />\nthe whole situation: \"The University is sliding and has suddenly<br />\nrealized how fast it is sliding, and<br />\nis now resorting to Draconian me,<br />\nthods.\"<br />\nThe SAC referred the housback to its housing subissue<br />\ning<br />\n(continued on page 5)<br /><br />\nGordon Resists<br />\nBy DAVID HOELSCHER<br />\nPresident Gordon, in response to proposals<br />\nset forth by the Committee for APL, stated<br />\nWednesday that attempts to halt all classified<br />\nresearch at the Applied Physics Laboratory are<br />\n\"absurd.\"<br />\n\"What concern does a Johns Hopkins student have with APL?\" he asked. Stating that<br />\nstudents should be involved with campus issues.<br />\nGordon indicated that if they want to protest<br />\nthey \"should try to get different Congressmen<br />\nelected.\"<br />\nGordon said that APL could not exist on<br />\ncampus. \"Fortunately,\" he noted, the APL is in<br />\nHoward County where its classified nature cannot interfere with the normal functioning of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nGordon noted that the Department of Defense, the sole contractor for the APL, would<br />\nnot accept a declassification of all projects.<br />\n\"The majority of important work done that's<br />\n\u2022important to the Department of Defense is<br />\nclassified,\" Gordon asserted. \"To declassify it<br />\nwould reduce its usefulness.\"<br />\nUnclassified\u2014Except for Details<br />\nWhile Gordon stated that the general projects at the Hopkins affiliated laboratory are not<br />\nclassified, \"the details are.\" Much of the work<br />\nrequires access to classified material, he explained.<br />\nGordon's remarks were in response to a set<br />\nof four proposals adopted by the Committee on<br />\nAPL Tuesday. These proposals are to be submitted to the Board of Trustees next week.<br />\nThe Committee has called for the Univer-<br /><br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee was informed Wednesday of Administration plans<br />\nfor an effective rent hike of at least fifteen per cent for all University housing.<br /><br />\nStudents Are Excluded<br />\nAPL Proposals From Any Involvement<br />\nIn Academic Council<br />\nsity to accept no more classified projects for<br />\nthe Laboratory and either to terminate or declassify all current projects. The Committee also<br />\nproposed to the trustees that a Citizens Committee be set up \"to formulate and implement a<br />\npolicy of converting the APL's research priorities<br />\nfrom military research to research in the areas of<br />\nenvironment, transportation, urban studies and<br />\nother social needs.\"<br />\nJim Keogh, co-organizer of the Committee<br />\nfor APL, indicated that Gordon's reaction did<br />\nnot concern him. \"Gordon, while perhaps an<br />\ninteresting example of social pathology, is really<br />\nirrelevent to the issue of APL. We expect that<br />\nthe decision will be made by the Board of<br />\nTrustees.\"<br />\n\"We're sure the Board of Trustees is concerned enough about our present national crises<br />\nthat they will respond affirmatively to our proposals,\" he added. \"We just cannot forsee a<br />\nnegative response.\"<br />\nA major portion of the debate over APL<br />\nhas centered around its usefulness, as a military<br />\nresearch complex, to the University. Gordon<br />\nstated that defense spending is \"the most cultural and costly problem to be reckoned with.\"<br />\nHe added that there has been no change in the<br />\nproblems and conditions facing the world since<br />\nWorld War II.<br />\nConstraints On Whom?<br />\nGordon noted, however, that APL places<br />\nsome constraints on the Universi6/. \"If it did<br />\nnot exist today and someone came to us and<br />\nasked that it be established, I think it unlikely<br />\nthat thapproach would be accepted.\" He said<br />\n(continued on page 11)<br /><br />\nBy MIKE MacADAMS<br />\nTheoretically an advisory board to the<br />\nPresident, the Academic Council is, in reality,<br />\nthe ruling force in \"all University academic<br />\nmatters\" both undergraduate and graduate.<br />\nAccording to President Gordon, Chairman of.<br />\nthe Council, \"the primary function of the Academic Council is the hiring and promotion of<br />\nprofessors\" above the assistant, professor level<br />\nas well as the granting of tenure.<br />\nThe President commented further that its<br />\n\"second most important purpose has to do with<br />\ndetermining the shape of the academic enterprise,\" specifically in the \"abolition, consolidation and establishment of departments.\"<br />\nIn addition to these ,matters, the Council<br />\nwas responsible for such recent decisions as coeducation, in 4-0-4 program, the elimination of<br />\nthe physical education and language degree requirements, the removal of ROTC from academic credit status and the creation of the Urban<br />\nAffairs Center.<br />\nLargely because of the extent to which the<br />\nCouncil affects the nature of the academic community, and the fact that its meetings are not<br />\nopen to non-members, faculty or student, many<br />\nlobservers have criticized it. According to Di.<br />\nlAchinstein of philosophy, member of the Council and the chairman of its subcommittee on the<br />\n\u2022 Humanities, the closure of the Council is., how\u2022<br />\never, necessary.<br />\nThis, he explained, was due .to the \"very<br />\n\u2022 personal and sometimes very embarrassing\" nature of the subjects discussed when faculty<br />\n(continued on page 2)<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nMarch 13, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nAcademic Body Explores Future School Development<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nare considered for appointment or promotion or when departments are subjected to general review and \"must be kept<br />\nstrictly confidential.\" These discussions, Achinstein went on to say, \"take<br />\nup the vast bulk of the meetings\".<br />\nThe situation is further exacerbated<br />\nby the restriction of eligibility for membership on the Council to senior faculty<br />\nmembers and the lack of some standing<br />\nvehicle for direct student input.<br />\nTo remedy the problem, an as yet<br />\ninformal movement has been gaining<br />\nmomentum within the Council to split<br />\nit into two bodies, one remaining closed<br />\nand dealing primarily with faculty membership and one composed of a more<br />\nrepresentative body of junior and senior<br />\nfaculty and students. One supporter of<br />\nthis plan, Associate Dean Strider,an exofficio member of the Council and chairman of its Graduate Board Subcommittee,<br />\nenvisioned the \"Non-academic Council\".<br />\nIt would be comprised of both students<br />\nand faculty and would have under its<br />\njurisdiction power over student discipline in academic matters as well as<br />\ncurricular<br />\nchanges<br />\nand proposals.<br />\nStrider further suggested that the establishment of a non-voting group common<br />\nto both of these parallel, but independent councils, which would allow for<br />\ncontinuity and act as a medium by which<br />\nideas could be exchanged between them.<br />\nIn addition to its routine review of<br />\nfaculty, the Academic Council is currently, according to President Gordon,<br />\ndevoting its energies to \"trying to develop some view of the core of what<br />\ngeneral things a university must have.\"<br />\nConvening last Tuesday night, The Council \"carried on a discussion of the university ten years hence.\"<br />\nDuring this meeting,projected appraisals of the various departments were<br />\npresented by the \"group planning coordinators\" from each of the departments. The purpose of this evaluation<br />\nwas to lay plans which would both avoid<br /><br />\nforseen problems in the near future<br />\nand allow for enough departmental flexibility to deal with those problems and<br />\ndevelopments<br />\nnot presently obvious<br />\nwhen they do arise. One such area<br />\nunder examination was the future of<br />\nthe Classics Department, most of whose<br />\nmembers are soon approaching retirement.. Also discussed was the matter<br />\nof the eventual size of the University,<br />\nboth student and faculty, and what facilities must be made available to handle<br />\n, the incoming women.<br />\nAll matters deemed within the jurisdiction of the Academic Council must<br />\nbe placed before it for review before<br />\nbeing submitted to the President and<br /><br />\nthe Board of Trustees for approval.<br />\nOrganizations<br />\nsuch as the General<br />\nAssembly or the Student Association<br />\n(or an individual student or faculty member) may prepare recommendations to<br />\nbe submitted to the Council by one of<br />\nits subcommittees.<br />\nEach one of these groups, however,<br />\ntheoretically presents its recommendations before the Council itself, but may<br />\nnot participate in Or witness any subsequent consideration or vote of the council on the proposal. In spite of all<br />\nthis secrecy, many of the members find<br />\nit an impressively effective system of<br />\nchecks and balances and approve of its<br />\nsmall and exclusive membership.<br /><br />\nMembers of the Academic Council<br />\n,are selected by general faculty election, two per year for five year terms.<br />\nIn addition the Council elects two additional members for one year terms to<br />\ninsure that all disciplines will be represented. These twelve faculty members<br />\nare franchised while the four man exofficio board (composed of Vice President Bevan and Deans Strider, Swanson<br />\nand Kimball) has no votes. The President and Chairman of the Council may<br />\nvote only in the event of a tie. The<br />\nCouncil meets three times a month,<br />\ntwice during the afternoons in the Board<br />\nRoom of Shriver Hall and once, informally, during the evenings.<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br />\nPRO MUSICA<br /><br />\nCONSENT TO ADVISE<br /><br />\nThe New York Pro Musica will present<br />\na concert in Goucher's Kraushaar Auditorium on Sunday, March 15, at 8:30<br />\np.m. The price of tickets is a secret.<br />\nThey must be purchased at the door, or<br />\ncall 825-3300, extension 267.<br /><br />\nATTENTION HUSSITES!<br /><br />\nAFTER DINNER FILMS<br /><br />\nHoward Kaminsky, historian at the<br />\nUniversity of Washington, will speak on<br />\n\"The Role of the University of Prague<br />\nin the Hussite Revolution\" on Monday,<br />\nMarch 16 at 4 p.m. in the Clipper<br />\nRoom.

Such a move would have the practical effect of<br /><br />\nassuring 1199's presence on the ballot.<br />\nThree weeks ago, 1199E withdrew its NLRB petition,<br />\nand 1231 began negotiations with the University in secret.<br />\nAt the same time, the University announced a pay boost<br />\nfor its employees to bring wages here into line With those<br />\nat Hopkins Hospital.

H.Lawrence,<br />\nF. Scott Fitzgerald, Virginia Woolf and<br />\nWilliam Faulkner. A faculty member,<br />\nfrom the English Department, sits in on<br />\nevery meeting, but the students have<br />\nfull control over the meeting and report<br />\nthat the faculty member often says nothing.<br />\nThe course originated last semester<br />\nwhen a group of students became concerned about the lack of course offerings<br />\nin maie-rn literature. Mark Derr,a member of that group, said that \"We all<br />\nwanted literature that was not spoiled<br />\nby pedantic lecturers.\"<br />\nThey approached Professor Ronald<br /><br />\nPaulsen, Chairman of the department,<br />\nabout the possibility of a student-run<br />\nseminar in this field. They had heard of<br />\na similar set-up at Swarthmore.<br /><br />\nAnother of the essays, tentatively set<br />\nas the introductory section, will deal<br />\nwith political activity, specifically the<br />\nHopkins role in the moratorium and the<br />\nNovember 15 march on Washington.<br />\nThat essay is expected to run about 25<br />\nor 30 pages.<br />\nAdams stressed that each photo essay<br />\nwould be \"down to earth, not avant-garde,<br />\nsoalething that has a point to make and<br />\nmakes it.\"<br />\nAdams indicated that some of the<br /><br />\nAll Friends<br /><br />\nExperimental Seminars<br />\nDr. Paulson approved of the idea and<br />\nsuggested that the group talk to Dr. J.<br />\nHillis Miller whose field is modern<br />\nliterature. The students emphasized the<br />\nlarge interest the English Department<br />\nshowed in the idea. Derr stated that they<br />\n\"encourage experiments,\" pointing out<br />\na current offering in modern novels<br />\ntaught by a graduate student, Michael<br />\nRagussis. The student's seminar is officially under Dr. miller, listed as Independant Reading.<br />\nThe course is divided into four sections of three weeks each.

He described it<br />\nas \"something that will conjure up what it<br />\nhas been like being in that fucking library for four years and throating in general.\" That essay is being created by<br />\nPhil Heffernan.<br /><br />\nmed. The faculty member at the meetings, who is different every week, was<br />\n'termed an \"observor.\"<br /><br />\nphotos would be \"in the direction of<br />\nstream of cons iousness.\" He added,<br />\nhowever, that they would definitely not<br />\nbe \"esoteric.\"<br />\nWith subscriptions down thirty to forty<br />\npercent from last year there is a growing possibility that the yearbook will<br />\nend up in the red. However, according<br />\nto Allen Rubeo, business manager for<br />\nthe Hullabaloo, the staff is keeping a<br />\ntight budget.<br />\n\"We've bought no equipment,\" said<br />\nRubeo. He was referring to the $1400<br />\nspent on equipment by last year's staff.<br />\nThe yearbook lost $2,000 last year.<br /><br />\nAll involved in the course have called<br />\nit a success. The students pointed out<br />\nthat one of the reasons for this may be<br />\nthe fact that all were friends before the<br />\ncourse started.<br />\nThe students decided that anyone who<br />\nwas not doing the readings would be<br />\ndropped from the course. Each participant gives himself a grade. The only requirement besides attendance is that the<br /><br />\nSoc. Rel.'s Rossi Resigns<br />\nCiting personal reasons as the predominating cause, Dr. Peter Rossi has<br />\ntentatively resigned from his post as<br />\nchairman of the Social Relations Department pending the outcome of a search<br />\nfor. his successor.<br />\n\"I've been holding down an administrative post for ten years,\" said Rossi,<br />\n\"and I've had it.\" Rossi felt that division of his time between his research<br />\nand his administrative duties was detrimental to both. Because his primary<br />\ncommittment is to research, Dr. Rossi<br />\nchose to relinquish the chairmanship.<br />\nThe outgoing chairman refused to<br />\nspeculate on what changes might occur<br />\nIn his department as a result of his<br />\nresignation. He did, however, express<br />\nhope that the new chairman would be able<br />\nto devote himself more fully to the tasks<br /><br />\nRubeo said that with the classes donating money, and through appeals to parents, the yearbook hoped to defray its<br />\nexpenses. Yet Adams said that what will<br />\nmost affect the financial situation of the<br />\nyearbook is the response received from<br />\nthe advertisers.\"<br />\nThe Hullabaloo has had a few other<br />\nminor problems. Photographer John<br />\nEgan decided to take the semester off<br />\nwhile he had the chance.<br />\nThe other problem is that only about<br />\n50% of the usual number of seniors who<br />\nhave their photos taken for the yearbook<br />\nhave as yet done so. Adams emphasized<br />\nthat any senior who desires to have his<br />\npicture taken for the year book can do so<br />\nby going to Hutzlers department store.<br /><br />\nstudent keep a journal, recording his<br />\nreactions to the readings. This can take<br />\nany form.<br />\nDerr stated that \"The main benefit of<br />\nthe course is how we come to understand<br />\nour ability to read lit.\" He pointed out<br />\nthat this is especially evident when one<br />\nis teaching.<br />\nA similar set-up is present in the Psychology Department where Dr. Robert<br />\nHogan, is sponsoring a seminar in Jung<br />\nwhich is composed entirely of undergraduates. This course meets on Monday<br />\nevenings in students' homes. No faculty<br />\nmember is present.<br /><br />\nof administration. Stated Rossi, \"I suspect that with anew chairman the department will be better administered.\"<br /><br />\nDenies Pressure<br />\nRossi denied that pressure or opposition from within the department had<br />\nbrought about his resignation.

To the leaders of Baltimore's black community, he is a major<br />\nfigure.<br />\nDr. Wickwire's career at Hopkins began in 1953. He soon engaged himself<br />\nin the various demonstations that were<br />\nthen starting to crack Baltimore's hitherto placid racial status quo. In the late<br />\nfifties he participated in an attempt to<br />\nintegrate the Northwood Theatre, near<br />\nMorgan State College. He also aided in<br />\nefforts to desegregate facilities at Ocean<br />\nCity, Maryland.<br /><br />\nOther Jazz<br />\nIn 1959, under the aegis of the YMCA,<br />\n(which then ran the Chaplain's Office<br />\nand the Student Association) Wickwire<br />\nand others organized one of the city's<br />\nfirst major concerts open to both blacks<br />\nand whites. The concert, held in the Fifth<br />\nRegiment Armory and starring Dave<br />\nBrubeck, Chico Hammerton and other<br />\njazz artists, did not develop into the riotous chaos that many thought it would.<br />\nDr. Wickwire said that the event that<br />\nmost inspired him to continue in civil<br />\nrights occured in 1961, when, during a<br />\nvisit to the Soviet Union with a group of<br />\nstudents, he was accused(falsely)of distributing anti-Soviet propaganda. The<br />\ngroup was put on trial, and acquitted,<br />\nbut Dr. Wickwire was impressed by the<br />\nexperience. \"I came back to America<br />\nfeeling that I wanted to do everything<br />\npossible to do away with every kind of<br />\nsecond-class citizenship.\" In Baltimore,<br />\nthe chances for this sort of opportunity<br />\ngrows on trees.<br /><br />\nagainst Gwynn Oak's no-black policy.<br />\nReverend Vernon Dobson, minister of<br />\nthe Union Baptist Church and President<br />\nof the Interdenominational Ministerial<br />\nAlliance, described the civil-rightists'<br />\nnet move: \"We figured that July 4,<br />\n1963 would be a good day to attempt to<br />\ndesergregate. We took thousands of people down to prepare for a mass arrest,<br />\nincluding some members of national civil<br />\nrights organizations. What followed was<br />\nthe largest arrest of clergy ever at one<br />\ntime.\"<br />\nDr. Wickwire spent a few days in jail.<br />\nAmong those who were confined with him<br />\nwas Michael Schwerner, a civil rights<br />\nworker, who, with two others, a year<br />\nlater would be found mysterious1:: murdered in Philadelphia, Mississippi.<br />\nGeorge Wallace entered the Maryland<br />\nPresidential primary against Daniel Brewster in 1964. Wickwire became active<br />\nin the \"Stop Wallace\" Committee which<br />\nbrought up \"truth squads\" of civil rights<br />\nworkers from Alabama to help inform<br />\nBaltimore Voters concerning the Wallace<br />\nthreat via rallies at major churches.<br />\nVery Accommodating<br />\nAlso in 1964, he became co-chairman<br />\nof the Statewide committee to Uphold the<br /><br />\nHomewood Bound<br />\nAt the same time, Chaplain Wickwire<br />\nwas working within the Hopkins community to improve conditions for blacks.<br />\nTogether with a group of graduate students, he tried to persuade the University to open up its admissions policy<br />\nso as to admit more blacks. They also<br />\nencouraged the employment of more<br />\nblack help. The University's policy of<br />\nhaving two separate housing lists, one<br />\nfor whites and one for blacks, was eliminated.<br />\nWithin the last few years, Dr. Wickwire has concentrated more on the housing situation. He has sat on realtor's<br />\nboards and has tried to hit them to change<br />\ntheir discriminatory codes of ethics.<br />\nLittle progress, however, has been made<br />\nin this field. \"It is still very difficult<br />\nfor blacks to get out of the inner city<br />\ninto the county,\" says Dr. Wickwir<br />\ne.<br /><br />\nJuly 4, 1963<br />\nBlatantly;racist Gwynn Oak Amusement<br />\nPark became the target for Baltimore<br />\ncivil rights activists in 1962 and<br />\n1963.<br />\nAs a member of the Gwynn Oak Park<br />\nCitizens Committee, Dr. Wickwire became the first clergyman to take a stand<br /><br />\nPublic Accommodations Law. This law<br />\nwas to be put to a referendum in the forthcoming election. If approved, all Maryland public accommodations would be<br />\nforced to submit to desegregation. A prosegregation group, the Maryland Petition<br />\nCommittee, produced a petition with<br />\ntwenty thousand signatures opposing the<br />\nreferendum. Wickwire's committee then<br />\nlaunched into a counteractive project<br />\nthat was determined to prove that many<br />\nof the petition's signatures were forged,<br />\nrendering it invalid. Working out of Levering Hall almost around the clock<br />\nthroughout the summer,using computers,<br />\nhandwriting analysts and trained aides<br />\nwho scoured voter registration files,<br />\ncomparing signatures, enough evidence<br />\nwas accumulated to prove the petition<br />\nwas definitely a forgery. The public accommodations law won at the polls.<br />\nWalter Carter, whom Wickwire calls<br />\n\"the most important man in civil rights<br />\nin the state of Maryland,\" commented<br />\nthat: \"Chester Wickwire was the one<br />\nman most responsible for segregation's<br />\ndefeat in 1964.

Most successful is the tutoring program, which was initiated in 1963<br />\nto aid the education of black children<br />\nliving in the area of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital. There is a group of \"court<br />\nwatchers\"--students who are trained<br />\nto look for irregularities in the \"justice\"<br />\nmeted out to blacks by the city's lower<br />\ncourts.<br /><br />\nFriend Of Panthers<br />\nWickwire has also been keeping in<br />\ntouch with the Baltimore Black Panther<br />\nParty by trying to serve as mediators<br />\nbetween them and the community.He has<br />\ncome to their aid once already, when he<br />\nraised money to pay their gas and electric<br />\nbill.<br />\n\"Conditions in Baltimore have improved--but there is a long way to go. Much<br />\nwork must be done in education,housing,<br />\nand employment,\" Wickwire surmises.<br />\nBlack leaders in Baltimore agree that<br />\nwhat progress has been made owes much<br />\nto Chester Wickwire.

However, the petition<br />\ndeals with the broader problems<br />\nof University priorities and student power in decision making.<br />\nAt the heart of the complaint<br />\nis the fact that graduate stipends<br />\nare fixed while housing costs<br />\ncontinue to rise. Many graduate<br />\nstudents, especially those with<br />\nfamilies, are hard Pressed to<br />\nmake ends meet even now. The<br />\neighty six signers of the petition<br />\naccused the University of' attempting \"to wrest itself from<br />\nIts financial problems at the<br />\nexpense of those least able to<br />\nbear the burden.\"<br />\nThe petition was presented<br />\nMonday night at a meeting called by graduate students Bob Cotter of Biophysics and Ray Copson of Political Science. The<br />\nconference, held in the lobby of<br />\nMcCoy Hall, was called to discuss the strategy for a rent strike<br />\nby dorm residents in protest over<br />\nthe in Tease in rent.<br />\nThe petition, two pages in length, is explicit in its condemnation of the Administration. The<br />\nCommittee on Housing, which is<br />\nsupposed to make student concerns known to the administration<br />\nhas been consulted only on the<br />\nmatter of which rooms in McCoy<br />\nWill be used for the undergraduate women.

There research could be done on<br />\npossible alternatives to the rent increase. Another<br />\npossible task for the Housing subcommittee may<br />\nbe to mediate the rent strike proposed by the graduate students.<br /><br />\nThree Plans<br />\nThe University has presented three plans for<br />\nminimizing the telephone charge for graduate<br />\nstudents. The first suggestion is to allow them<br />\nto make only local calls through the Hopkins<br />\nswitchboard. This would be slightly less expensive<br />\nthan the present system. Pay phones in the halls<br />\nIs the second suggestion.<br />\nThe final idea would involve individual arrangements with the phone company. For $8.10 per<br />\nmonth a student could have a black, single party,<br /><br />\neYo<br /><br />\ndialing phone, and unlimited calls. A two-party<br />\neconomy phone would cost $3.95 per month and<br />\n5.9C per call.<br />\nThe housing of female undergraduates was another of the questions confronting the committee.<br />\nWhen asked later about the number of girls to be<br />\nhoused in McCoy Hall, Mr. Kaberle said, \"I can't<br />\n'seem to find any solid figure.

Let me tell<br />\nyou a true story about someone I once<br />\nknew. For the sake of a little contrived<br />\nirony let's call him after my middle<br />\nname, Lawrence; Larry, for short.<br /><br />\nCherry Smash Bottles<br />\nLarry comes from a good liberal family; his father studied physics under<br />\nErwin Schrodinger. Larry came to Hopkins to study physics; he was politically<br />\nradical, an intellectual, with a broad<br />\nstreak of the surrealistic in his head-he had a large collection of Cherry Smash<br />\nbottles and his own religion, based on<br />\nhis interpretation of the prophesies of<br />\nthe angel Moroni. He had the usual complaints about Hopkins, lousy food, lousy<br />\ndorms, lousy graduate instructors, and<br />\nwhy have grades since they mean so<br />\nlittle? But trips to Druid Hill Park and<br />\nvarious radical activities make Hopkins<br />\na tolerable place.<br />\nHe moved off campus his second year<br />\nand became involved in the drug scene.<br />\nHe left school for a while and worked<br />\nas a weather observer in Alaska and did<br />\nfield labor in California.<br />\nWhen he came back to school he went<br />\nback into the drug business and put up<br />\ntransient freaks. He also started to sell<br />\nstolen records,some from D.C. and some<br />\nhe personally liberated from the Book-<br /><br />\nBenzon<br /><br />\nstore. Eventually someone in the Bookstore chose to notice his activities and<br />\nhe received a two week suspension (apparently no one had any notion of the extent of his activities) which he spent<br />\nshoveling shit and pitching hay on a farm.<br />\nWhen he got back to Hopkins he turned<br />\nhis unmasking to advantage, and served<br />\nas a decoy for other thieves.<br /><br />\nLavender Fire Hydrant<br />\nMeanwhile he had managed to steal<br />\na law and order club out of the car of<br />\nOne of Baltimore's Finest (unnoticed)<br />\nand to paint a fire hydrant lavender-which was noticed; he had to remove the<br />\npaint. He told me that the Blue Meanies<br />\nwere moving in--he is right, of course.<br />\nHe also had an interest in color; he<br />\nbought a set of plastic light filters and<br />\ncut them to fit his glasses so that he could<br />\nstudy the affective tonality of a color by<br />\nlooking at the world through that color.<br />\nWith some friends of his to help, he liberated a number of overhead projectors<br />\nand slide projectors from the University<br />\nso that he could experiment with light<br />\nand make light shows. He felt he could<br />\nput the equipment to better use that the<br />\nUniversity did--he had no intention of<br />\nfencing the stuff.<br />\nWell, he's left Hopkins (though I think<br />\nhe got a degree in Psychology), a longhaired social outcast, and split for California on the money he made from his<br />\nvarious enterprises-- I don't know whether or not he made it, but I hope so.<br />\nNot because I think that California is a<br />\nParadise, but simply because that's what<br />\nhe wanted to do (as opposed to what<br />\nsomeone else thought would be good for<br />\nhim.)<br />\nNot being unreasonable, I'm not going<br />\nto try saddling Hopkins with the entire<br />\nresponsibility for this everyday tragedy,<br />\nThe University can't be held accountable<br />\nfor the Nation. But it can be held accountable for its own community. And that<br />\naccount is a pretty grim one.<br /><br />\nExtensive Ignorance<br />\nI can't help but believe that if Hopkins<br />\nwhere a genuine community of free men<br />\nand scholars (rather than a feed bin for<br />\nthe economy) it wouldn't have overlooked Larry, put him off by denying him a<br />\nstake in his own life. Perhaps if he had<br />\nbeen treated as a responsible member of<br />\nthe community and had been given a stake<br />\nin that community, he wouldn't have felt<br />\n(continued on page 11)<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\nACLU SNAFU<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn reference to the article by Mike<br />\nMacAdams appearing in Friday March<br />\n6 edition \"ACLU: Resist Petition may be<br />\nIllegal\" I would like to correct a significant number of errors present, define my role in the Hopkins Peace Action<br />\nCommittee, and clarify my personal preferences for future anti-war activities.<br />\nFirst of all, concerning the \"We Won't<br />\nGo Petition.\" An individual by indicating<br />\nhis intention to refuse induction is NOT<br />\nviolating any law.

Since no<br />\npolicies are decided by the Hopkins Peace<br />\nAction Committee except in open meeting by show of hands and since I am not<br />\nthe \"head\" of the organization, I felt<br />\nthat the only appropriate news release<br />\nshould include the major strategies of the<br />\nvarious national organizations and the<br />\nirationale behind those policies.<br />\nI was therefore, very annoyed to find<br />\nthe News-Letter article stating that the<br />\nHopkins Peace Action Committee had<br />\nalready accepted tactics which I simply<br />\nmentioned as possible plans of various<br />\nnational organizations and groups in<br />\nother cities. I was also very much disturbed by the implication that I personally called for the adoption of certain strategies and that I would be the leader in<br />\nimplementing them.<br />\n(continued on page 7)<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\n(continued from page 6)<br />\nIn speaking to the News-Letter reporter (incidentally, I was only contacted<br />\nover the telephone; never approached<br />\npersonally) I repeatedly emphasized that<br />\nI was simply reviewing proposed actions.<br />\nI can therefore, only conclude that in the<br />\npreparation of the article the various<br />\nproposals were incoherently synthesized<br />\nand that the incoherent result was put<br />\nforth as the policy of the Hopkins Peace<br />\nAction Committee and credited to me<br />\npersonally. I would like to cite an example<br />\nof this type of synthesis. Midway in the<br />\narticle this sentence appeared<br />\nWith good organization, Lipman said,<br />\nenough pressure can be exerted to<br />\n\"cripple\" the Selective Service System and perhaps \"force Nixon into a<br />\ncorner.\"<br />\nThis statement appears to be a handily<br />\nedited combination of two totally different<br />\nstatements.<br />\n1) Various groups feel it is possible<br />\nto cripple the Selective Service system by massive civil disobedience.<br />\n2) With good enough grass roots organization others feel enough people<br />\ncan be made aware of the fallacies<br />\nof the Vietnamization policy. These<br />\npeople in coalition with already existing anti-war elements can force Nixon<br />\ninto a political corner.<br />\nDue to this and other misquotations<br />\nappearing in the article I feel it is necessary for me to articulate my own preferences for further anti-war activities.<br />\nI feel that while the majority of Americans can not be \"radicalized,\" they<br />\ncan be made aware of the need for Immediate Withdrawal, sharply reduced<br />\ndefense spending, and the end of the draft<br />\nsystem, given the acceptability of the<br />\npeace movement. By acceptability I mean<br />\nthe ability of the majority to incorporate<br />\nanti-war sentiment into their conceptual<br />\nframework of the \"givens of America\".<br />\nIn other words, I feel that in order to<br />\nachieve these three specific goals, the<br />\nanti-war movement must avoid actions<br />\nthat would alienate the greater numbers<br />\nof Americans. Disruption at Draft Centers is one of thse activities.It is logically impossible for us to cripple the Selective Service system without incurring<br />\nrepression which I feel the majority of<br />\nAmericans would support. What we must<br />\ndo is reach enough people to make it<br />\npolitically necessary for a self-seeking<br />\npolitician to support immediate withdrawal, reduce defense spending, and<br />\nend the draft.<br />\nWhile many consider this pragmatic<br />\nstance co-option, I feel it is the only<br /><br />\nway we can end the killing.<br /><br />\nGeorge M.

Besides inconveniencing the football banquet, the rescheduled<br />\nexams overlapped three basketball<br />\ngames, one swim meet, and two wrestling matches. This forced many to compete on even the same day they took exams.<br />\nMost of these athletes had no choice but<br />\nto return to Hopkins on Jan. 5. For this<br />\ninconvenience, upperclassmen had to<br />\nsupport their own food requirements<br />\nwhile being mostly for athletic reasons.<br />\nThe<br />\ndidn't supplement<br />\nuniversity<br />\nSaga's funds and extension of service<br />\nwith no new money had a telling effect on<br />\nthe food freshmen tried to live on. For<br />\nall of this, the meets were witnessed<br />\nby capacity crowds as high as even fifteen. The intersession was detrimental<br />\nto a large percentage of those who had to<br />\ntake part in it.<br />\nI can only say what effect this had on<br />\none sport. I know that these circumstances were instrumental in a very poor<br />\nturnout for the wrestling squads. It was<br />\nthe inability to fill the weight classes<br />\nthat ruined Hopkins' previously improving record.<br />\nI hope that in future programs, more<br />\nconcern for the consequences of all involved will result in more harmonious<br />\nresults.<br /><br />\nKeith Gordon<br />\nClass of'73<br />\nTHE STUDENT WHAT?<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nGovernance.

They feel<br />\nthat a particular course would be beneficial to them yet a department isn't interested, even though there are enough<br />\nto make a class. Their education goes<br />\nlacking or they also leave the campus,<br />\nnever to return.<br />\nShould leaving be the only alternative<br />\nto a bad situation? Shouldn't Hopkins try<br />\nto keep its best minds that refuse to put<br />\nup with the run-around? Or is the University leadership intent on a sprialling<br />\nmediocrity, the end being a university<br />\nof only fairly intelligent people?<br />\nMost complainants wish to help change<br />\nthe University negligence of their problems, yet when they attempt to articulate an interest, either there is no place<br />\nto express it or that expression seems<br />\nto die in a committee somewhere. What<br />\nthey are looking for is a representative<br />\nbody that will consider their particular<br />\nproblems and attempt a solution. Presently, a university group of faculty,<br />\nstudents, and administrators is missing<br />\nat Hopkins.

WON'T GO<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nBeing registered as a C.O., I am as<br />\nmuch opposed tothe draft system and to<br />\nwar in general as any one on campus. It<br />\nis for this reason that I have absolutely<br />\nno argument with the writers of several<br />\narticles and letters in your March 6th<br />\nedition concerning the nature of the war<br />\nin Vietnam and the immorallity of the<br />\ncurrent system of military conscription.<br />\nBecause I am morally opposed to violence in any form (as a traditional religious pacifist), however, I find myself<br />\ndiametrically opposed to the current<br />\ntactics of such organizations as New<br />\nMobe and the Peace Action Committee.<br />\nAlthough these organizations do not<br />\nappear violent under ordinary standards,<br />\nmy stipulated definition of \"violent\"<br />\nincludes violence in word and thought,<br />\nas well as in deed. I, therefore, consider the actions of these organizations<br />\nviolent, in that they promote polarization<br />\nthan reconciliation, alienation<br />\nrather<br />\nrather than association, and separation<br />\nrather than the unification of individuals<br />\nin brotherhood. Thus, through the use of<br />\nsuch confronatation tactics as the \"We<br />\nWon't Go\" petition, more is being done<br />\nto divide mankind than to unite it. Since I<br />\nam a firm believer in non-violence, I<br />\ncannot justify these confronting actions<br />\non the grounds that they are not truly<br />\nnon-violent, in the deepest sense of the<br />\nword.<br /><br />\nAPL FILM FLAM<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI happened to notice in a recent edition<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Newsletter that<br />\npeople are finally getting interested in<br />\nwhat the Applied Physics Lab is all about.<br />\nA.P.L. itself has a 30-minute(approx.)<br />\nfilm called the \"Applied Physics Lab<br />\nStory\" which is really worth seeing.<br />\nA.P.L. has been making this film available for public viewing, meetings. etc.<br />\nThis writer saw it at a \"science\" fair<br />\nat the Civic Center a couple of years<br />\nago.<br />\nI would suggest to people who would<br />\nlike to know what the A.P.L. is up to,<br />\nstraight from the horse's mouth (so to<br />\nspeak), to get hold of that film for a<br /><br />\nDue to the fact that I am a<br />\nI find myself between those who oppose<br />\nwar as I do, but resort to confrontation,<br />\non the one hand; and those who do neither,<br />\non the other hand.

His intention is to have the other three<br />\nclasses reimburse the juniors with $100 each in order to even out the<br />\ndistribution of the donation among all four classes. Although there is<br />\nno responsibility for the other classes' officers to back Wolk up,<br />\nwe strongly recommend that they do simply to present a united front<br />\nto the Administration. The University has been delinquent in assuming its responsibility for paying the swimmers' way to the<br />\nNCAA's.<br />\nAfter having strained and sacrificed for an entire season, the swimmers are put upon by the administration to sacrifice an extra day of<br />\nclasses in order to make the trip by car rather than by plane. Who do<br />\nwe thank up there in the administration for this imposition on an athlete as a conscientious student?<br />\nPerhaps, and maybe rightfully so, the blame can stop with Director<br />\nof Student Affairs, Robert Bilgrave, who has remained mysteriously<br />\nquiet throughout the swimming team's crisis. Last year Bilgrave's<br />\noffice gave $200 towards the swimmers' trip to Springfield, Mass,<br />\nfor the NCAA's. This year he can only afford in the vicinity of $50.<br />\nThis is but one of many examples where our penny-wise and poundfoolish Administration is forcing the students to fend for themselves.<br />\nLarry Wolk's laudable action proves that the students really do care.<br />\nPerhaps, our past cynicism has been created by an unresponsive<br />\nAdministration.<br />\nIndications come from David Kaufman's Office that there will not<br />\nbe need to repeat the swimmers'search for money to go to the NCAA's<br />\nnext year. It is still not too late for those Administrators to donate<br />\nthe extra money for the swimmers to fly. How about it? We've done<br />\nmore than our share in meeting them halfway.<br />\nAthletes do more than just represent Hopkins undergraduates-they represent the entire university. It is high time that our administrators do more than just represent their own rung on \"Lincoln's<br />\nladder.\" Some already do \"stand up to be counted,\" to borrow Coach<br />\nSotir's phrase.<br />\nNow, not next year, is the time to show the undergraduates that<br />\nsense of caring for OUR HOPKINS is not just hollow words within<br />\nour hallowed walls. There need not and should not be a discrepancy<br />\nbetween student and administration concern.<br />\nSwimmers are providing the cars and drivers to make the trip to<br />\nMichigan. Swimmers spent literally over 100 hours lifeguarding at the<br />\npool to raise money to go to the NCAA's. Students raised 98.4% of.<br />\nthe money to finance the trip. Nowhere does one see the word administration.

On March 21, the team takes on Yale<br />\nUniversity, to open the 1970 season. The Blue Jays<br />\nare long-shot contenders for the national title this<br />\nyear. The favorite is considered to be the Military<br />\nAcademy at West Point.<br /><br />\nCoker Leads Squad<br />\nHopkins will be led by senior All American<br />\nCharlie Coker, the top scorer last year. Coker<br />\nwill be joined at the mid-field spot by co-captain<br />\nDoug Honig and junior Bill Donovan. Both Honig<br />\nand Donovan are lettermen from last year.<br />\nThe second line mid-field unit will consist of<br />\nco-captain Russ Moore, junior Doug Fuchs and<br />\nsophomore Gary Handleman. The middies have<br />\nbeen the unlucky group so far as both Honig, who<br />\nhas a muscle pull, and Handleman, who separated<br />\nhis shoulder during the scrimmage with the Maryland Lacrosse Club, are injured. Fuchs will be<br />\nready for the Yale game, but Handleman is still a<br />\nquestion mark.<br />\nJuniors Jim Grenafege, Bob Duncan,and Wayne<br />\nWoodward compose the third middle unit. Sophomores Dave Nelz and Bob Kelley offer support<br />\nand competition for spots in the third unit.<br /><br />\nInjuries Hurt<br />\nBecause of the pre-season injuries to Honig<br />\nand Handleman, Bob Pfeifer and Pat Pilachowski,<br />\nwho normally play attack, have been practicing<br />\nwith the midfield. Pfeifer, who is also quarterback<br />\nfor the football team, lettered last year.<br />\nDefensively, Paul Weiss, a third team AllAmerican, is the only returning starter from last<br />\nyear's club as Mike Clark and John Cardillo have<br />\nboth graduated. Bob MacCool, who played for Mt.<br />\nWashington last year will be the second starting<br />\ndefensiveman with Joe Cieslowski and Larry<br />\nTeitel battling for the third spot.<br />\nDoug Hein is a highly competent replacement for<br />\nany of the three defensemen. Also, Coach Scott<br />\nexpects the continued improvement of sophomores<br /><br />\nStu Kahl a letterman from last year will lead<br />\nthe crease attackmen. However, graduation has<br />\nalso affected this unit as three time All-American<br />\nJoe Cowan and Jim Feely have graduated. Cowan<br />\nis the all-time leading scorer of the Hopkins Lacrosse team.<br />\nThis year, the two other attack positions will<br />\nbe manned by Dan Hall and Paul Wallace. Hall<br />\ncame on strongly at last year's finish with two<br />\ngoals and an assist against Maryland. Wallace<br />\nwas one of the top scorers of last year's freshmen<br />\nclub. Jay Hanas will lend support to Hall's and<br />\nWallace's position behind the goal. Bill Barton<br />\nwill play behind creaseman Stu Kahl. John<br />\n\"Weedy\" Hammond offers additional support at<br />\nthe crease position.<br />\nThere is an interesting battle being waged for<br />\nthe goalie position. Junior Kenney Dauses will<br />\nget the starting nod in the opening game with<br />\nYale, but senior Peter Conti, who has not played<br />\nlacrosse since his freshmen year, will keep the<br />\npressure on Dauses. The keen competition, should<br />\nmake the starting goalie play a better game.<br /><br />\nElis Pose Threat<br />\nYale should prove to be a strong test in the<br />\nhome opener. The Elis recently lost to the Long<br />\nIsland Lacrosse Club, the strongest club team<br />\nof last year, by the score of 9 to 4. Yale has a<br />\nfine goalie and two good sophomore attackmen.<br />\nThe Blue Jays did lose seven of ten starters<br />\nlast year. But as Coach Scott stated, it's a new<br />\nyear, with a new group. The team is anxious<br />\nto play and works very hard in practice. They<br />\nare a club determined to play well, to strive to<br />\ncontinue Hopkins'winning lacrosse tradition. This<br />\ndetermination represents a minimumization of<br />\nmistakes and a continued game hustle. A winning<br />\nspirit encompasses the entire team and its<br />\ncoaches. The team realizes the task before it,<br />\nand every effort will be made to achieve it.<br />\nIn a preseason scrimmage, the Jays lost 14-8<br />\nto the Maryland Lacrosse Club.

Kuntsler contends<br />\nthat it is impossible to have a fair trial<br />\nin the over-whelmingly white, rural, and<br />\nconservative Harford County. Cambridge, nearly 100 miles away, is onethird black.<br />\nBrown's friend, Ralph Featherstone,<br />\nand an unidentified black man, were<br />\nkilled late Monday night as a powerful<br />\nexplosive device shattered their car on<br />\nthe outskirts of Bel Air. Initially, there<br />\nwas some fear that the unknown dead<br />\npassenger might be H. Rap Brown, but<br />\na medical examination proved otherwise.<br />\nThe real controversy, though, centered on where the explosives came from<br />\nState Police officials said that the explosive device was being carried in the<br />\ncar and that it was apparently resting<br /><br />\non the floor between the feet of the<br />\nunidentified passenger. Judge Dyer himself inspected the remnants of the car,<br />\nand he later told reporters that he believed the explosive device went off accidentally in the car.<br />\nKuntsler, along with some of Maryland's black leaders, was not so sure<br />\nthat Featherstone and his companion<br />\nwere carrying explosives.<br />\nKuntsler<br />\nsaid he had known Featherstone for<br />\nyears, and, he added, \"I don't think<br />\nthat sort of thing was Ralph Featherstone's bag.\"<br /><br />\ntion, but adjourned the hearings until<br />\nMonday.<br />\nOn Tuesday night, an unused courthouse in Cambridge was rocked by explosives allegedly planted in a bathroom<br />\non the second floor. Governor Mandel<br />\nvisited the scene to determine the extent of the damage.<br /><br />\nThe. jury has not been selected yet,'<br />\nand H. Rap Brown's presence is not<br />\nrequired until jury selection begins next<br />\nweek.<br />\nKuntsler intends to challenge<br />\nthe jury as unrepresentative of the<br />\ncommunity, and prejudiced. He intends<br />\nto ask prospective jurors questions like,<br />\n\"Do you know what a dashiki is.\"<br /><br />\nThe black leaders hinted that State<br />\nPolice white-washed the investigation,<br />\nand that the car had been ambushed by<br />\nright-wing extremists.<br />\nWalter Lively, former executive director of the Urban Coalition of Baltimore, and Clarence Davis, of Aberdeen,<br />\nsaid that the investigation had barely<br />\nstarted before the police had announced that the explosive device was carried on the floor of the car.<br />\nMr. Lively charged, \"The men would<br />\nhave had to be fools to allow it to explode accidently.\" In addition, Davis<br />\nand Lively said that the marks of a<br />\ntire skid behind the explosive site indicated that another car had hurled explosives at the Featherstone car. They<br />\nfelt that the attack had been carried out<br />\nby \"Birchers or the Klan.\"<br /><br />\nWitnesses<br />\nThe State Police said they had found<br />\ntwo witnesses to the explosion, and that<br />\nthe only other car on the road was driven by one of the witnesses. The blast<br />\noccurred about a mile north of the State<br />\nPolice barracks.<br />\nKuntsler demanded an indefinite adjournment of the pretrial hearings, because, he said, the community was so<br />\naroused that a fair trial was impossible.<br />\nThe judge rejected Kuntsler's conten-<br /><br />\nH.

In every case, the points in question have been confined<br />\nmerely to how a given policy would be carried out in practice. The determination of these policies, however, has thus far been totally out of the<br />\nhands of the university's students.<br />\nThis is why the Graduate Student Organization, in the spirit of the Free<br />\n'University's pioneering work, is sponsoring an open seminar to examine the<br />\npurpose of the university and the implications of this purpose on how the<br />\nuniversity should be governed.<br /><br />\nGarrett Room ,M.S.E.
