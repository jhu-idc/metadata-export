First<br />\nSergeant William J. Flemming<br />\nhas a record that indicates that<br />\nhe should be of very great value<br />\nin his new station at Hopkins as<br />\nan assistant to Captain Ellis. He<br />\nhas served in the Spanish-American War, and with the Luzon Expedition in the Philippines, is an<br />\nexpert rifleman, and knows all<br />\nthere is to be known about infantry work. Sergeant Flemming's<br />\nhome town is Pittsfield, Mass.<br />\nAn additional commissioned<br />\nofficer will probably be sent to<br />\nHopkins next fall, although the<br />\nmatter is still somewhat uncertain. Besides increased personnel, additional equipment has arrived, and even more is to come.<br />\nThe cadet officers have been issued<br />\nholsters and belts which make<br />\ntheir appearance at drill very<br />\n\"natty\" indeed but the most notable acquisition is that of two<br />\nmachine guns which arrived not<br />\nlong ago. Captain Ellis intends<br />\nto form a machine gun squad from<br />\nmembers of the freshman and<br />\nsophomore companies, and hereafter machine gun work will be a<br />\npart of every man's military education at Hopkins.<br />\nNext year, the unit will use the<br />\n1903 model army rifle, instead of<br />\nthe present 1917 design. The<br />\nolder model is much superior in<br />\nshooting qualities, and the unit<br />\nwill profit by the transaction when<br />\nthey receive the 190 guns promised for next fall.<br />\nColonel Bull's inspection of the<br />\nunit resulted in its recommendation for inspection by the inspectors of distinguished institutions.<br />\n\u2022 The latter inspect only last year's<br />\nhonor units, and those recommended by the first inspector,<br />\nColonel Bull. Upon their decision rests the question of whether<br />\nor not Johns Hopkins will be a<br />\ndistinguished institution this<br />\nyear. Every effort is being made<br />\nto make the result of the second<br />\ninspection favorable, and to this<br />\nend Captain Ellis has decided to<br />\nhave voluntary field work on Saturday mornings until after the<br />\ninspection. The plan is a good<br />\none, and has been made even more<br />\nattractive, by the offer of an excuse from a Thursday drill period<br />\nafter the inspection, for every Sat-<br />\n<br />\nStill working to promote the<br />\ninterests of athletics at the University, the Johns Hopkins 'Varsity Club has taken several important steps during the past few<br />\nPermission has\u2022 been<br />\nweeks.<br />\ngranted to the club by the Board<br />\nof Trustees of the University to<br />\nconduct a campaign to raise the<br />\nnecessary funds for the formation<br />\nof a company known as the 'Varsity Holding Company, the purpose of which will be to take over<br />\nthe management of the financial<br />\ninterests of the General Athletic<br />\nAssociation. This organization<br />\nwill be governed by a board of<br />\ntrustees, consisting of nine men;<br />\ntwo of whom shall be students<br />\nat the University, elected by the<br />\nundergraduate body. Under this<br />\nsystem, the athletic association at<br />\nthe University will continue to<br />\nperform its duties as usual, except that it will be relieved of the<br />\nlarge and important task of handling the finances. All such matters as the collecting of athletic<br />\nfees, and the management of ticket sales will be left in the hands<br />\nof the Holding Company, thus<br />\nleaving the General Athletic Association free to concentrate on<br />\nthe actual building up of the<br />\nteajns and arranging the games.<br />\nAiming to bring about still<br />\ngreater co-operation between the<br />\n'Varsity Club and the active student body, the requirements for<br />\nmembership to the club have been<br />\nbroadened to include undergraduates. This means that any man<br />\nwho has won an \"H\" will be eligible to become a member of the<br />\n'Varsity Club. In this way, it is<br />\nhoped to bring the club into closer<br />\ntouch with the activities which are<br />\ngoing on at Homewood, and to give<br />\nthe students, who are taking an<br />\nactive part in athletics, and who<br />\nare therefore intimately in touch<br />\nwith the present situation at Hopkins, an opportunity to express<br />\ntheir view.<br />\n<br />\nNEW INSTRUCTOR FOR UNIT<br />\nR. o.

He showed the failure<br />\nof the old system of voluntary enlistment in the great war, and the<br />\ninjustice it worked on individuals<br />\nin sending them out unprepared<br />\nto meet a well-trained foe.<br />\nWarren Driver, first speaker<br />\nand chairman of the senior team,<br />\ngraphically pictured the evils of<br />\na great officer and bureaucratic<br />\nclass which would spring up with<br />\nthe adoption of such a system. He<br />\nattacked the democracy of the<br />\nplan on the ground that the discipline and blind loyalty demanded by a military machine were<br />\ncounter to all the precepts of consideration and discussion upon<br />\nwhich democracy is founded.<br />\nHarold Reed, the second affirmative speaker, concerned himself<br />\nwith the other possible means of<br />\nnational defense.

This applies especially<br />\nto those industries whose net returns are large, compared to the<br />\nvalue of their plants.

First<br />\nSergeant William J. Flemming<br />\nhas a record that indicates that<br />\nhe should be of very great value<br />\nin his new station at Hopkins as<br />\nan assistant to Captain Ellis. He<br />\nhas served in the Spanish-American War, and with the Luzon Expedition in the Philippines, is an<br />\nexpert rifleman, and knows all<br />\nthere is to be known about infantry work. Sergeant Flemming's<br />\nhome town is Pittsfield, Mass.<br />\nAn additional commissioned<br />\nofficer will probably be sent to<br />\nHopkins next fall, although the<br />\nmatter is still somewhat uncertain. Besides increased personnel, additional equipment has arrived, and even more is to come.<br />\nThe cadet officers have been issued<br />\nholsters and belts which make<br />\ntheir appearance at drill very<br />\n\"natty\" indeed but the most notable acquisition is that of two<br />\nmachine guns which arrived not<br />\nlong ago. Captain Ellis intends<br />\nto form a machine gun squad from<br />\nmembers of the freshman and<br />\nsophomore companies, and hereafter machine gun work will be a<br />\npart of every man's military education at Hopkins.<br />\nNext year, the unit will use the<br />\n1903 model army rifle, instead of<br />\nthe present 1917 design. The<br />\nolder model is much superior in<br />\nshooting qualities, and the unit<br />\nwill profit by the transaction when<br />\nthey receive the 190 guns promised for next fall.<br />\nColonel Bull's inspection of the<br />\nunit resulted in its recommendation for inspection by the inspectors of distinguished institutions.<br />\n\u2022 The latter inspect only last year's<br />\nhonor units, and those recommended by the first inspector,<br />\nColonel Bull. Upon their decision rests the question of whether<br />\nor not Johns Hopkins will be a<br />\ndistinguished institution this<br />\nyear. Every effort is being made<br />\nto make the result of the second<br />\ninspection favorable, and to this<br />\nend Captain Ellis has decided to<br />\nhave voluntary field work on Saturday mornings until after the<br />\ninspection. The plan is a good<br />\none, and has been made even more<br />\nattractive, by the offer of an excuse from a Thursday drill period<br />\nafter the inspection, for every Sat-<br /><br />\nStill working to promote the<br />\ninterests of athletics at the University, the Johns Hopkins 'Varsity Club has taken several important steps during the past few<br />\nPermission has\u2022 been<br />\nweeks.<br />\ngranted to the club by the Board<br />\nof Trustees of the University to<br />\nconduct a campaign to raise the<br />\nnecessary funds for the formation<br />\nof a company known as the 'Varsity Holding Company, the purpose of which will be to take over<br />\nthe management of the financial<br />\ninterests of the General Athletic<br />\nAssociation. This organization<br />\nwill be governed by a board of<br />\ntrustees, consisting of nine men;<br />\ntwo of whom shall be students<br />\nat the University, elected by the<br />\nundergraduate body. Under this<br />\nsystem, the athletic association at<br />\nthe University will continue to<br />\nperform its duties as usual, except that it will be relieved of the<br />\nlarge and important task of handling the finances. All such matters as the collecting of athletic<br />\nfees, and the management of ticket sales will be left in the hands<br />\nof the Holding Company, thus<br />\nleaving the General Athletic Association free to concentrate on<br />\nthe actual building up of the<br />\nteajns and arranging the games.<br />\nAiming to bring about still<br />\ngreater co-operation between the<br />\n'Varsity Club and the active student body, the requirements for<br />\nmembership to the club have been<br />\nbroadened to include undergraduates. This means that any man<br />\nwho has won an \"H\" will be eligible to become a member of the<br />\n'Varsity Club. In this way, it is<br />\nhoped to bring the club into closer<br />\ntouch with the activities which are<br />\ngoing on at Homewood, and to give<br />\nthe students, who are taking an<br />\nactive part in athletics, and who<br />\nare therefore intimately in touch<br />\nwith the present situation at Hopkins, an opportunity to express<br />\ntheir view.<br /><br />\nNEW INSTRUCTOR FOR UNIT<br />\nR. o. T. C. Battalion<br /><br />\nBy a unanimous and popular<br />\ndecision of the judges, the senior<br />\ndebating team defeated the juniorsin the annual Senior-Junior debate held in the Civil Engineering<br />\nHall last Saturday evening. The<br />\nwinners upheld the negative of the<br />\nproposition, \"The United States<br />\nShould Have a System of Compulsory Military Training.\" The only<br />\ndirect clash of the evening came<br />\nover the question of the democracy<br />\nof such,a plan, nearly every speaker, at one time or another, attempting to prove that his policy<br />\nwould safeguard our well-known<br />\nAmerican ideals.<br />\nMervin Deems, the first speaker for the affirmative and the juniors, stressed particularly the historically proved necessity and the<br />\ninherent justice of the proposal.<br />\nHe stated that the affirmative<br />\nwould propose no definite plan,<br />\nbut would rest their case on, the<br />\ndesirability of the system as a<br />\nprinciple. He showed the failure<br />\nof the old system of voluntary enlistment in the great war, and the<br />\ninjustice it worked on individuals<br />\nin sending them out unprepared<br />\nto meet a well-trained foe.<br />\nWarren Driver, first speaker<br />\nand chairman of the senior team,<br />\ngraphically pictured the evils of<br />\na great officer and bureaucratic<br />\nclass which would spring up with<br />\nthe adoption of such a system. He<br />\nattacked the democracy of the<br />\nplan on the ground that the discipline and blind loyalty demanded by a military machine were<br />\ncounter to all the precepts of consideration and discussion upon<br />\nwhich democracy is founded.<br />\nHarold Reed, the second affirmative speaker, concerned himself<br />\nwith the other possible means of<br />\nnational defense.

He said it was not<br />\ndue to his position as an author,<br />\na scientist or a teacher that his<br />\nfame would live, but to a combination of all of these:<br />\n\"It was Osler's genius for organization that gave to the student attending the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School opportunities unequaled anywhere in America.

Not only has the expected amount not been raised, but<br />\nthe expenses of the campaign have<br />\nscarcely 'been met by the proceeds<br />\nof the tickets sold.<br />\nWhy has this campaign failed<br />\nso miserably? There can be but<br />\none cause, and hard as it may be<br />\nto face, we must do so.<br />\nIt is the deplorable lack of pep<br />\nand spirit which Johns Hopkins<br />\nstudents have shown the past few<br />\nyears, this quagmire in which they<br />\nare wallowing, and out of which<br />\nthey seem not only uhable, but unwilling to climb.<br />\nHow many of you, out of an undergraduate student body numbering about 600, have put yourselves out to the extent of spending even half an hour in the Barn,<br />\nfolding or addressing circulars?<br />\nNot more than 75. How many of<br />\nyou have obtained even one subscription? Not more than 50. A<br />\nperfect example of the all-consuming lethargy which is eating away<br />\nat the vitals of Johns Hopkins<br />\nspirit.<br />\nLet us look into this matter<br />\nand see who have been doing all<br />\nthe work which has been required<br />\nto obtain the results so far netted.<br />\nWith but few exceptions, all who<br />\nhave done any work for this campaign are the men on the athletic<br />\nsquads, or those who are in some<br />\nway connected with them. Those<br />\nwho are not connected with the<br />\nteams have not so much as lifted<br />\na finger to aid Mr. Kistler in the<br /><br />\nsplendid work which he is inaugurating this spring.<br />\nHow many of you, who have not<br />\nhelped in this cause, may we take<br />\nthe liberty of asking, whether<br />\nsophomore, junior or senior, have,<br />\nsince the lifting of your freshman<br />\nregulations requiring you to attend Hopkins games seen as many<br />\nas three contests at Homewood?<br />\nIf you are one of these slackers,<br />\nwe are talking straight to you.<br />\nWhat is the matter with you?<br />\nHaven't you the backbone to come<br />\nout and sacrifice a little of your<br />\nhighly valuable time, or are you<br />\ncontent to take everything from<br />\nand give nothing to your University? If you are among this class,<br />\nyou should be ashamed to call<br />\nyourself a Hopkins man, for Hopkins is frankly ashamed to claim<br />\nyou.<br />\nThis spring, the athletic managements have offered to us the<br />\ngreatest opportunity in the athletic line since Hopkins has been<br />\nfounded. Not only have the largest schedules on record been undertaken, but colleges and universities which have.hitherto been<br />\nconsidered out of \u2022 our class, will<br />\nbe met this season.<br />\nHarvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell\u2014all have been included in<br />\nbaseball, track and lacrosse. No<br />\ncollege is too good for our Alma<br />\nMater. Do we ralize that?( What<br />\ndoes it entail on our part? Are we<br />\nto sit quietly by while these colleges come down,trounce us,and go<br />\n-home again? If we do this, it is a<br />\nforegone conclusion that there will<br />\nnot be a game with Hopkins on<br />\ntheir next year's schedule. But<br />\nHopkins is on these schedules to<br />\nstay, and the only way for this to<br />\nbe accomplished is for each and<br />\nevery one of us to do his part.<br />\nWe can serve our Alma Mater<br />\nin more ways than one. If we are<br />\nathletically inclined, we owe it to<br />\nourselves as well as to the College<br />\nto go out for some team. If we<br />\nare physically unableto participate<br />\nactively, there are many vacancies<br />\nin the managerial departments<br />\nopen to any candidate. And last,<br />\nbut far from least, we can serve<br />\nour College in the grandstand,<br />\nbacking up her every play with<br />\ncheers and songs. The first game<br />\nis this Friday, against Princeton<br />\nin baseball. With such a curtain<br />\nraiser to our athletic program it<br />\nis to be hoped that every Hopkins<br />\nman who does not participate actively in the contest in some way,<br />\nwill be in the rooting section,<br />\ncheering on the Black and Blue.<br />\nIs it worth while for us to keep<br />\nthese big colleges on our schedule?<br />\nIf it is, it is the plain duty of<br />\nevery true Hopkins man to be in<br />\nthe stands, not only Friday, but<br />\nSaturday, and eyery day on which<br />\na game is called.<br />\nBeauty used to be a matter of<br />\nline and form; now it's a matter<br />\nof concealing the ears, arching the<br />\neyebrows, redding up the lips and<br />\ngiving the neck and back more<br />\nair.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S MAILBAG<br />\nQUACKS FROM A QUACK<br />\nA Column in Which the Correspondents<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, but Shoulder the Responsibility.<br />\nAll letters intended for publication<br />\nmust be concise.<br />\nNo attention will be Paid to anonymous. letters, but names signed as an<br />\nevidence of good faith will not be printed<br />\nif request is made that they be omitted.<br />\nThe publication of a letter is not to be<br />\ntaken as an indorsement of its views by<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, Which invites the<br />\nfreest discussion of matters of general<br />\ninterest.<br />\nAn Excellent Idea.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nSir\u2014Along with the immediate<br />\nimpetus of the many non-athletic<br />\nactivities at Hopkins, has come a<br />\nstampede to draw up constitutions and to bestow insignia.<br />\nEvery small organization in the<br />\nCollege is at present designing<br />\nbadges for its officers or members.<br />\nWhile the idea of giving a sign of<br />\nrecognition to men who have excelled in student pursuits is a<br />\nvery worthy one, it seems to the<br />\nwriter, that before we create a<br />\nwhole string of diversified cheap<br />\njewelry with which to decorate<br />\nour persons like German generals,<br />\nwe should consider if it would not<br />\nbe better to adopt a uniform Hopkins badge for all these activities.<br />\nThe badge or pendant might be of<br />\ngold in the form of the shield of<br />\nour University, and might be engraved with the name of the field<br />\nor fields of endeavor in which it<br />\nwas won. It might in addition<br />\nbear a star on its border for each<br />\nactivity of its wearer.<br />\nThe arguments for this are obvious.
