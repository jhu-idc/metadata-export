Herne, author of \"Margaret<br />\nFleming,\" to break away from the<br />\nabsurd melodrama so rampant at<br />\nthat period. Berne's plays dealt<br />\nwith people who were living. On<br />\nthe other hand, it was pointed out,<br />\nHerne was not a realist in the sense<br />\nthat Maxwell Anderson, author of<br />\n\"What Price Glory,\" is. The author of \"Margaret Fleming\" was<br />\nconcerned with the common people.<br />\nHerne Influenced By Ibsen<br />\nIt has often been said Ibsen<br />\nexerted a great influence over<br />\nHerne. Hamlin Garland, who was<br />\na close friend of the American<br />\ndramatist, said that while Herne<br />\ndid not imitate the Norwegian,<br />\nIbsen, he was greatly influenced by<br />\nhim. It is believed that \"Margaret<br />\nFleming\" is a conscious attempt to<br />\nintroduce the Ibsen influence into<br />\nthe American theatre.<br />\nvVhile at Princeton University,<br />\nMr. Ewing was intensely interested<br />\nin the Little Theatre.

Dr. Hodgkin<br />\nsuggested, in his address, that a<br />\ncommission of experts could have<br />\nlong been sent to review the situation and could have mainstained orderby an international police force.<br />\nIn discussing the League Dr.<br />\nHodgkin questioned whether America can continue to stand out of the<br />\nLeague. It is a grave mistake for<br />\nher to do so, he pointed out.

Its climate, relatively small<br />\npopulation, and natural resources<br />\nmake the country desirable to Russia, Japan, and China, who is, nominally, its sovereign, he said.

The floor of each half<br />\nis a \"grid\" of metal bars, to wh.ich<br />\nalternating current is applied when<br />\nappropriate switches are closed.<br />\nBy using high voltage ( l ,ooo to<br />\nI ,500 volts), and high resistance in<br />\nthe circuit ( sev~ral million ohms),<br />\nthe electrical resistance of the rat's<br />\nbody is made neglible, an exactly<br />\nmeasured shock-current can be<br />\nused.

Herne, author of \"Margaret<br />\nFleming,\" to break away from the<br />\nabsurd melodrama so rampant at<br />\nthat period. Berne's plays dealt<br />\nwith people who were living. On<br />\nthe other hand, it was pointed out,<br />\nHerne was not a realist in the sense<br />\nthat Maxwell Anderson, author of<br />\n\"What Price Glory,\" is. The author of \"Margaret Fleming\" was<br />\nconcerned with the common people.<br />\nHerne Influenced By Ibsen<br />\nIt has often been said Ibsen<br />\nexerted a great influence over<br />\nHerne. Hamlin Garland, who was<br />\na close friend of the American<br />\ndramatist, said that while Herne<br />\ndid not imitate the Norwegian,<br />\nIbsen, he was greatly influenced by<br />\nhim. It is believed that \"Margaret<br />\nFleming\" is a conscious attempt to<br />\nintroduce the Ibsen influence into<br />\nthe American theatre.<br />\nvVhile at Princeton University,<br />\nMr. Ewing was intensely interested<br />\nin the Little Theatre.

Dr. Hodgkin<br />\nsuggested, in his address, that a<br />\ncommission of experts could have<br />\nlong been sent to review the situation and could have mainstained orderby an international police force.<br />\nIn discussing the League Dr.<br />\nHodgkin questioned whether America can continue to stand out of the<br />\nLeague. It is a grave mistake for<br />\nher to do so, he pointed out. By<br />\nhaving joined the body in the \u00b7 beginning America could have lifted<br />\nthe League from the whirlpool of<br />\nEuropean politics in which it has<br />\nbecome engulfed, the Supper Club<br />\nspeaker asserted.<br />\nIn his address the speaker also<br />\ndiscussed the geographical, political,<br />\nand economic conditions in Manchuria. Its climate, relatively small<br />\npopulation, and natural resources<br />\nmake the country desirable to Russia, Japan, and China, who is, nominally, its sovereign, he said. The<br />\nfacts that of the approximate :28,000,000 people in Manchuria, at<br />\nleast 25,000,000 are Chinese and<br />\nthat for centuries the dynasty ruling China was Manchurian gives<br />\nChina preeminent rights there, Dr.<br />\nHodgkin asserted.<br />\nWars Have Resulted<br />\nThe questioning of China's rights,<br />\nhowever, has resulted in several<br />\nmajor wars and the forcing oi<br />\nChina into signing treaties drawn<br />\nup by both Russia and Japan.<br />\nDr. Hodgkin also spoke Tuesday<br />\nat a graduate-faculty luncheon.

The floor of each half<br />\nis a \"grid\" of metal bars, to wh.ich<br />\nalternating current is applied when<br />\nappropriate switches are closed.<br />\nBy using high voltage ( l ,ooo to<br />\nI ,500 volts), and high resistance in<br />\nthe circuit ( sev~ral million ohms),<br />\nthe electrical resistance of the rat's<br />\nbody is made neglible, an exactly<br />\nmeasured shock-current can be<br />\nused. The current used is scarcely<br />\nperceptible to a human being and,<br />\nfrom indications, not painful to the<br />\nrat. But because an electric shock<br />\nis strange to the rat it incites him<br />\nto get away from it.<br /><br />\nExcavations in Olynthus, Greece,<br />\nthis year exceeded those of 1928 in<br />\nimportance, it was asserted by Dr.<br />\nDavid M.
