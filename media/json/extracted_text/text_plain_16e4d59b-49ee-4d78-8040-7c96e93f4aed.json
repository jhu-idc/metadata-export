Hopkins organizations cannot attempt an<br />\nextended tour because outside of the city of Baltimore the institution<br />\nhas no organized alumni support.<br />\n<br />\nCake Eater<br />\n<br />\nAnd alumni support is essential in an undertaking of this kind.<br />\nA hall must be procured, widespread publicity must be obtained,<br />\ntickets must be sold and hundreds of other incidentals, which only an<br />\ninterested body can take care of, must be attended to.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014model of1900<br />\n<br />\nThere are divers other ways in which active alumni bodies, organized in the larger cities, could serve their Alma Mater. They could<br />\nmake possible longer trips for the athletic teams, they could \"tall:<br />\nHopkins\" to desirable preparatory material in their district and could<br />\nadvertise the University in numerous ways. In fact, there is no limit<br />\nto the aid which organized and enthusiastic groups of graduates could<br />\nrender to Hopkins.<br />\nIf June Week does nothing except to bring a large number of<br />\nalumni back to Hopkins and instil in them permanent enthusiasm<br />\nwhich will result in the formation of such bodies, the occasion will<br />\nbe a distinct success.<br />\nGO TO IT!<br />\nWhile the great world without goes on unconcernedly with its<br />\nwork, unaware that great and important events are pending, an undercurrent of excitement pervades the Hopkins campus. Frequent secret<br />\nmeetings are held at which doors and windows are zealously policed<br />\nto prevent intrusion. Undergraduates gather in select groups, put<br />\ntheir heads together in whispered conversation and appear to be<br />\ndiscussing problems of enormous significance. An air of secrecy, of<br />\nmystery, of restrained expectancy, permeates the atmosphere.<br />\nSuch behavior naturally elicits doubts and misgivings from the<br />\nunitiated. To the undergraduate, however, these symptoms merely<br />\nappear as an indication that banquet season, famed in Hopkins traditions, is about to open. While the apparently dignified Seniors and<br />\nJuniors look on with ill-concealed jealousy, the Freshmen and Sophomores formulate carefully guarded plans in which the terms \"kidnapping,\" \"class officers\" and \"suburbs\" figure to a great extent.<br />\nGo to it, men! Class banquets constitute one of Hopkins' most<br />\nvalued traditions. You will retain memories of accompanying events<br />\nlong after Calculus and Greek, Physics and History have departed<br />\nfrom even the sub-conscious mind.

Frequent secret<br />\nmeetings are held at which doors and windows are zealously policed<br />\nto prevent intrusion. Undergraduates gather in select groups, put<br />\ntheir heads together in whispered conversation and appear to be<br />\ndiscussing problems of enormous significance.
