While<br />\nthere is no doubt that the costs of operating Hopkins are<br />\nrising and will continue to rise over the next year or so, it<br />\nseems somewhat short-sighted to expect students to bear the<br />\nfull burder of the increased cost of running the University.<br />\nFor awhile, students and their families will continue to<br />\nmake an effort to pay the increased costs, but as Vice<br />\nPresident for Business Management Robert Bowie predicted<br />\nwhile discussing the contemplated tuition htke, at some<br />\npoint, private institutions will simply price themselves out of<br />\nthe market for able students. In order to prevent hard-pressed<br />\nstudents from being forced to drop out of the University<br />\nentirely, Hopkins officials should make a strong effort to<br />\nobtain more aid from state and federal programs. and use it<br />\nto hold down any tuition hike. Here in Maryland, the Pear<br />\nCommittee report, if adopted, would furnish Hopkins with<br />\nan extra S600,000 in unrestricted funds in fiscal 1976, funds<br />\nwhich would go a long way toward reducing the size of a<br />\ntuition boost.

At halftime, the Blue<br />\nJays held a 37-26 advantage.<br />\nThe relentless Loyolans<br />\nreturned to the fray with a tough<br />\npress and aggressive play that<br />\nchallenged the Hopkins advance.<br />\nSeveral turnovers in the face of<br />\nthe pressure dissipated the Blue<br />\nJay lead.

In short order, three key<br />\nLoyolans fouled out and a<br />\ncharity stripe victory seemed<br />\npossible. Though the Blue Jays<br />\nhit only 57 percent of their<br />\nsecond half free throws, frequent<br />\ntrips to the line produced 17 gift<br />\npoints.<br />\nThe thrill-packed final two<br />\nminutes saw co-captains John<br />\nRutter and Bobby Freedman try<br />\nto dribble out the clock with a<br />\n71 -69 lead. The hosts<br />\nintentionally fouled Freedman,<br />\n<br />\nbut he missed both shots, giving<br />\nLoyola a chance to tie. The<br />\nGreyhounds failed and fouled<br />\nJews, who hit one. Loyola then<br />\nscored a twenty-footer with 16<br />\nseconds on the clock, setting up<br />\nDeLong's heroics.

Despite<br />\nhaving key big men on the bench<br />\nin foul trouble during much of<br />\nthe game, the Blue Jays pulled in<br />\n50 rebounds. DeLong and Jews<br />\n<br />\neach grabbed 11 while Rutter<br />\nand Oscar Schreiber split twelve<br />\nbetween them.<br />\nThe win raises Hopkins' overall<br />\nrecord to 7-5 and marks the<br />\nsecond year in a row that<br />\nHopkins has topped Loyola on<br />\nthe road.

With four<br />\nplayers scoring double figures,<br />\nthe Jays didn't turn out to be<br />\npushovers for the 8-0 Jackets,<br />\nlosing only 70-61 on the basis of<br />\nfree throws. The loss dropped<br />\nHopkins into the consolation<br />\ngame with MAC rival Muhlenberg<br />\nand thereby set up a test of<br />\nleague strength. Behind a<br />\n16-point, 18-rebound effort by<br />\nBill Jews, the Jays trounced the<br />\nMules 64-45, commanding the<br />\nboards by a 2-1 margin.

While<br />\nthere is no doubt that the costs of operating Hopkins are<br />\nrising and will continue to rise over the next year or so, it<br />\nseems somewhat short-sighted to expect students to bear the<br />\nfull burder of the increased cost of running the University.<br />\nFor awhile, students and their families will continue to<br />\nmake an effort to pay the increased costs, but as Vice<br />\nPresident for Business Management Robert Bowie predicted<br />\nwhile discussing the contemplated tuition htke, at some<br />\npoint, private institutions will simply price themselves out of<br />\nthe market for able students. In order to prevent hard-pressed<br />\nstudents from being forced to drop out of the University<br />\nentirely, Hopkins officials should make a strong effort to<br />\nobtain more aid from state and federal programs. and use it<br />\nto hold down any tuition hike. Here in Maryland, the Pear<br />\nCommittee report, if adopted, would furnish Hopkins with<br />\nan extra S600,000 in unrestricted funds in fiscal 1976, funds<br />\nwhich would go a long way toward reducing the size of a<br />\ntuition boost.

At halftime, the Blue<br />\nJays held a 37-26 advantage.<br />\nThe relentless Loyolans<br />\nreturned to the fray with a tough<br />\npress and aggressive play that<br />\nchallenged the Hopkins advance.<br />\nSeveral turnovers in the face of<br />\nthe pressure dissipated the Blue<br />\nJay lead. By the 11:40 mark<br />\nHopkins had added only ten<br />\nsecond half points as Loyola<br />\nnarrowed the gap to 47-46.<br />\nThen DeLong and senior<br />\nChuck LaBerge both converted<br />\nthree point plays as Hopkins<br />\nreeled off eight unanswered<br />\npoints to restore a margin of<br /><br />\nnine. However, Loyola kept the<br />\nheat on defensively and gave up<br />\nonly two more field goals in the<br />\nfinal ten minutes of the game,<br />\nthe last one coming with 6:06<br />\nremaining.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Greyhounds<br />\nraced back to tie the game at 59.<br />\nWith Blue Jay big men LaBerge<br />\nand Drew Fender fouled out and<br />\nBill Jews in foul trouble himself,<br />\nthe Hopkins prospects looked<br />\ngrim.

In short order, three key<br />\nLoyolans fouled out and a<br />\ncharity stripe victory seemed<br />\npossible. Though the Blue Jays<br />\nhit only 57 percent of their<br />\nsecond half free throws, frequent<br />\ntrips to the line produced 17 gift<br />\npoints.<br />\nThe thrill-packed final two<br />\nminutes saw co-captains John<br />\nRutter and Bobby Freedman try<br />\nto dribble out the clock with a<br />\n71 -69 lead. The hosts<br />\nintentionally fouled Freedman,<br /><br />\nbut he missed both shots, giving<br />\nLoyola a chance to tie. The<br />\nGreyhounds failed and fouled<br />\nJews, who hit one. Loyola then<br />\nscored a twenty-footer with 16<br />\nseconds on the clock, setting up<br />\nDeLong's heroics. His two<br />\nswishes from the line ended the<br />\ngame.<br />\nLoyola won the Metro contest<br />\nwith a running game and<br />\ncountless fast breaks. To counter,<br />\nBlue Jay Coach Gary Rupert<br />\nstressed getting back on defense<br /><br />\nwhile preparing for the<br />\nGreyhounds this week. \"I told<br />\nthe boys I wanted them sprinting<br />\nback on defense,\" Rupert said<br />\nafter the win. His strategy<br />\nworked as Hopkins kept Loyola<br />\nfrom getting easy layup<br />\nbreakaways.<br />\nRebounding was another key<br />\nto the Hopkins win. Despite<br />\nhaving key big men on the bench<br />\nin foul trouble during much of<br />\nthe game, the Blue Jays pulled in<br />\n50 rebounds. DeLong and Jews<br /><br />\neach grabbed 11 while Rutter<br />\nand Oscar Schreiber split twelve<br />\nbetween them.<br />\nThe win raises Hopkins' overall<br />\nrecord to 7-5 and marks the<br />\nsecond year in a row that<br />\nHopkins has topped Loyola on<br />\nthe road.
