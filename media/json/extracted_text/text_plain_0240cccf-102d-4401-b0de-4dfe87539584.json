We have petitioned,<br />\nif you remeniber, for the freest possible open discussion of matters before the Council. To a lesser extent<br />\nwe have entreated candidates to take public positions<br />\non such matters. Now, at last, we see the Council for<br />\nwhat it is.

There<br />\nis no reason why there can not be<br />\nany real, amateur, winning college<br />\nteams. Good students can also be<br />\ngood athletes. If we have varsity<br />\ncompetition, let's make our representatives respected by all our opponents or else let's drop intercollegiate<br />\nathletics.<br />\nIn short, we are striving for more<br />\n\"spirit\" because we feel that this is<br />\nwhat we lack to make life at Hopkins perfect and that the students'<br />\ncommon interest in our teams will<br />\nblossom out into a greater interest<br />\nin campus affairs and a closer comradeship among all students, regardless of where they live, whether they<br />\nare frat men or not and which branch<br />\nof the University they attend.
