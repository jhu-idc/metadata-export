The trustees completed the<br />\nportfolio changes by September<br />\n30.<br />\nOver the same nine months, investments in fixed income<br />\nsecurities and short-term money<br />\nmarket instruments rose by over<br />\nhalf, from twenty-five to thirtyeight percent.<br />\nThe market value of the EIP<br />\ndropped only eleven percent between September 30 and October<br />\n23, from $508 million to $447<br />\nmillion, while the Dow Jones<br />\ndropped 24.9 percent and the<br />\nStandard and Poor's 500 Index<br />\nfell 22.9 percent.<br />\nThe EIP's fixed income<br />\nsecurities, on the other hand,<br />\ngrew in value over the same three<br />\nweek period by 2.2 percent, a<br />\nfigure roughly equal to the<br />\ngrowth of the Shearson Lehman<br />\nGovernment/Corporate Bond Index.

Sunshine attributed the<br />\ngrowth to improvement in the<br />\nstock market as well as a continuing rise in the price of<br />\nsecurities.<br />\nRegarding future plans of the<br />\nCommittee on Investments, Sunshine does not expect any allocation changes in the short run, implying that the Committee wants<br />\nto see how the markets settle.<br />\n\"We're expecting the period of<br />\nvolatility to continue in the stock<br />\nmarket,\"he said. \"A portion of<br />\nthat volatility may effect what<br />\ndirection the securities go in.

Cox, a spokesman for the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said<br />\nhe believed the stock-market gyrations would have little impact on higher-education finances generally.<br />\n\"College endowments are widely diversified, and, in<br />\nthe main, they're conservatively managed,\" he said.<br />\nFurthermore, he noted, only a small percentage of the<br />\nnation's 3,300 colleges even have major endowments.<br />\nIn the aggregate, endowments account for only a small<br />\nportion of college income. According to the latest federal<br />\nstatistics, endowment income provided 5.3 per cent of<br />\nthe revenue of private colleges and only 0.6 per cent<br />\n<br />\nof the revenue of public ones in 1985-86.<br />\nLeigh A. Jones, vice-president for business and<br />\nfinance at Berea College and chairman of the NACUBO<br />\ninvestment committee, said small endowments, which<br />\ntypically are invested in fixed-income securities, should<br />\nnot have been badly hurt by the October 19 stock-market<br />\nplunge. \"Schools with a large commitment to equity<br />\nwould have suffered the most, but they have also gained the most\" from the rise in stock prices of recent years,<br />\nhe said.<br />\n'Real Impact' Will Be on Gifts<br />\n\"I think the real impact on higher education is not<br />\nin the short-term losses on market value on the endowments, but the impact it will have on contributions,\"<br />\nsaid Roderick MacDougall, the treasurer of Harvard<br />\nUniversity. \"A half a trillion dollars was taken out of<br />\nthe economy.\"<br />\nEven so, while college finance officers were not<br />\npanicking, they were certainly shaken up by last week's<br />\n<br />\nSee INVESTMENTS, 4<br />\n<br />\n\f,b 1.!iiWo.,34UVI<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/3<br />\n<br />\nCouncil suggests own changes to add-drop policy<br />\nApproves nominations for MSE Symposium, Spring Fair chairpersons<br />\nCOUNCIL, from 1<br />\nwho dropped courses would<br />\nreceive \"W\" grades.

If public feeling against Coke becomes<br />\nstrong enough, then the demand for RC will<br />\ngrow and the supply of Coke will become increasingly limited.<br />\nIf, however, a Coke boycott is unable to command the attention of the majority, then at least<br />\nan alternative is available for those who so<br />\ndesire it.<br />\nThis compromise, however, holds significance for much more than simply the provision<br />\nof a choice of soft drink brands on moral<br />\ngrounds. It is a move which should be examined<br />\nwith the Human Climate Task Force Report in<br />\nmind.<br />\nThe Coalition had initially attempted to bring<br />\nPepsi products to campus to replace Coke. This<br />\nis a logical choice because Pepsi is the nation's<br />\n\"second\" cola. Not only does Pepsi have wide<br />\nconsumer recognition and is easily available,<br />\nbut a switch on this campus from Coke to its<br />\nleading competitor might have been a slap in<br />\nthe face for the Coca-Cola Company.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the attempted switch to Pepsi<br />\nwound up being as odious for some members<br />\nof the Jewish Students Association as the continued use of Coke was for the Coalition. In<br />\nan effort to prevent further discord, the Coalition sought a compromise which would suit the<br />\ninterest of both organizations.<br />\nThe mutual respect and understanding promoted by the Task Force Report has shown<br />\nthrough in the Coalition's willingness to meet<br />\nthe needs of another campus group as well as<br />\nthose of their own.<br />\nFurthermore, Coalition members and RC<br />\norganizers Paul Genest and Bijoy Mathew have<br />\nemphasized how pleased they were with the<br />\ncooperation they received from Auxiliary<br />\nEnterprises on this effort. That they were so<br />\nwilling to give credit where credit was due further promotes a feeling of good will and<br />\ncooperation at Homewood.<br />\nFinally, the Coalition hopes to represent both<br />\nsides of the issue at its forthcoming forum on<br />\nthe use of Coca-Cola products. They plan to<br />\ninvite a Coca-Cola representative to speak as<br />\nwell as a South African rights activist. This<br />\nbalanced representation is an effective way of<br />\nencouraging people to learn more about CocaCola's involvement in South Africa.<br />\nThe decision to bring RC to Hopkins is a win<br />\nfor the Task Force Report as well as the Coalition. The methods used by the Coalition in striving for their cause may have forced them to<br />\ncompromise a bit, but their efforts to cooperate<br />\nand accomodate the interests of others set a<br />\nsolid example for other groups to follow.<br />\n<br />\nListening to Valid Criticism<br />\nAsk Hopkins undergrads about their proThe student has an obligation to discern from<br />\nfessors, or the Homewood faculty in general, lecture what the material is, as well as the<br />\nand the responses are very largely negative. organization with which it is presented.

You<br />\nmay recall that last year we, with<br />\nthe cooperation of Auxiliary<br />\nEnterprises, attempted to hold a<br />\nreferendum on the question of<br />\nswitching from Coca-Cola products to those of Pepsi (at best,<br />\na lesser of two evils, since Pep- .<br />\n<br />\nPaul Genest<br />\nBijoy Mathew<br />\neconomic disengagement of such<br />\nmulti-nationals.<br />\nCoke continues to dominate the<br />\nsoft drink market in South Afrcia<br />\n(they currently command 69% of<br />\nitm with 76% of sales reaped<br />\nfrom the pockets of blacks), and<br />\nwhile enjoying annual profits in<br />\nexcess of $250 M. per annum,<br />\nthey of course contribute a<br />\nsizeable amount of money<br />\nthrough taxes to the coffers of the<br />\nwhite minority government.

Is<br />\nthere a place for ethics at Johns<br />\nHopkins?<br />\nThe proctored exam system,<br />\nwhen implemented, was intended to be only a temporary solution to the ethics problems at the<br />\ntime. It closely paralleled the<br />\nHonor Code it replaced, with the<br />\nexception that enforcement was<br />\nno longer left entirely to the<br />\nstudents and was designed to<br />\nrevert back to an Honor System<br />\nwhen circumstances permitted.<br />\nBut the undergraduate situation<br />\nis hardly different than it was 13<br />\nyears ago.

The<br />\nsocial benefit to the school, he<br />\nfelt, is more important than<br />\nprofit.<br />\nWhile many wonder if the<br />\npopularity of Hoppy Hour will<br />\nlast, Kalas remains confident.<br />\n\"From the people I talked to<br />\nlast time, it is something they've<br />\nalways wanted,\" he said.<br />\n\"They're glad it's here and they<br />\nhope it continues.\"<br />\nOther students seemed equally<br />\noptimistic about the social hour's<br />\nfuture.<br />\nSaid Senior Cerra Donnem,\"I<br />\nthink it will catch on, given some<br />\ntime.\"<br />\nThe absence of heavy smoke<br />\nand \"sleazy weirdos\" appealed<br />\nto many of the new regulars like<br />\nPisa.<br />\n\"It's a great environment at<br />\nHoppy Hour since you don't have<br />\nto worry about whether or not<br />\nyou're meeting murderers,\" she<br />\nsaid.<br />\n<br />\nHannan.

The same can be said for the<br />\ntouring production of Arsenic and<br />\nOld Lace at the Mechanic this<br />\nmonth. The ingredients look good<br />\nbut the effect is disappointingly<br />\nbland.<br />\nYou may have heard about the<br />\nproduction. After a brief Broadway stint, the show already<br />\ntraveled through most major<br />\nAmerican cities. The publicity<br />\nhas been great. The big draw is<br />\nthe \"all-star\" cast.

The<br />\nplot centers around the Brewster<br />\nfamily. As Mortimer Brewster<br />\nsays, \"mental instability runs in<br />\nmy family. . . in fact, it practically<br />\ngallops!\" Abby and Martha<br />\nBrewster (played by Stapleton<br />\nand Ross, respectively) kill lonely<br />\nold men as an act of charity.<br />\nWhen straight man Mortimer<br />\n(MacArthur) discovers a body in<br />\na window seat in the home of his<br />\nsweet old aunts and learns of the<br />\neleven other corpses in the basement, the comedy of errors<br />\nbegins. The arrival of Mortimer's<br />\nlong-lost gangster brother,<br />\nJonathan (Frid), and the alcoholic<br />\nDr. Einstein (Storch) adds to the<br />\nconfusion, the comedy, and the<br />\nbody count.<br />\nSo, you've got five well-known<br />\ntelevision actors and actresses in<br />\none of the funniest plays ever<br />\n<br />\nwritten. What could be bad? Ohho-ho. That's just it. These are<br />\ntelevision actors and actresses.<br />\nPerhaps if ABC decided to make<br />\na Monday Night Movie version<br />\nof Arsenic and Old Lace the<br />\ncasting would be exemplary.<br />\nHowever, on stage this cast just<br />\ndoesn't cut the mustard.<br />\nIn all fairness, individually<br />\nsome of the actors and actresses<br />\nturn in fine performances. In a<br />\ncomedy, timing and interplay are<br />\nessential. Each member of the<br />\ncast is dependent upon the performances of others. One rotten actor spoils the bunch.<br />\nIn this case, the infectious actor is James MacArthur. His rendition of Mortimer is hollow and<br />\ninconsistent. His stage presence<br />\nis meek at best. In between lines,<br />\nhis character fades in and out like<br />\na TV set with bad reception. As<br />\na matter of fact, a bad reception<br />\nis what his performance deserves.<br />\nScenes between evil brother<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Princess Bride:<br />\nYou have to go and take a friend<br />\nhas \"Fencing, fighting, torture,<br />\nescapes, revenge, giants,<br />\nThe Princess Bride is the sort monsters, chases, true love,<br />\nof movie a friend takes you to miracles.\"<br />\nThe film opens as a young boy<br />\nsee, and then you go a second<br />\ntime to take a friend of yours who is sick in bed.

And take a friend.<br />\n<br />\nPhil Gochenour:<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\nOne of the greatest things to<br />\nhave emerged from the whole<br />\npunk movement was the notion of<br />\nexperimentation. Our understanding of what actually constituted<br />\na song, and our understhnding of<br />\nthe nature of music, underwent<br />\nradical changes. Artists like<br />\nLaurie Anderson and Pere Ubu,<br />\nand albums like Lou Reed's<br />\nMetal Machine Music, showed us<br />\nthat in every sound there is a kind<br />\nof music, and that any collection<br />\nof sounds might be a song.<br />\nProbably the most active group<br />\ntoday, in this respect, is Sonic<br />\nYouth. To Sonic Youth, the<br />\nguitar is merely an instrument for<br />\ncreating sound, not some sacred<br />\nobject that must be treated within<br />\ngiven parameters. In their quest<br />\nfor the ultimate sounds, they have<br />\nbashed guitars (they say Fenders<br />\nhold up best), used screwdrivers<br />\non the strings, inserted blocks of<br />\nwood under the bridges, and us-<br />\n<br />\nThe Flip Side<br />\n<br />\ned completely random tunings.<br />\nNow, you're asking, what does<br />\nall this sound like? It sounds pretty damn good, actually. On their<br />\nlatest album, Sister, the opening<br />\ntrack, \"Schizophrenia,\" could<br />\npass for being a mellow, jangly,<br />\nJoy Division/Smiths kind of song,<br />\nif it weren't for the off-balanced<br />\nlyrics and the slight dissonance<br />\nwithin the guitar chords. This,<br />\nhowever, is just a way to ease you<br />\ninto the madness that follows.<br />\nEach song on this album is, in its<br />\nown way, somewhat psychopathic, whether it's the repression of<br />\n.\"(I've got a) Catholic Block,\" or<br />\nthe outright psycho-killer insanity of \"Pacific Coast Highway.\"<br />\nTake the psycho, sometimes<br />\ncryptically disturbing lyrics, and<br />\nlink them up with music that combines headlong speed, heavily<br />\nfuzzed guitars, and hound from<br />\nhell vocals and what do you get?<br />\nTunes that will melt your brain<br />\ninto a grey ooze. Yeah, it's that<br />\ngood. Just one word of warning:<br />\n<br />\ndon't listen to this album under<br />\nthe influence, or you just might<br />\nlose .your mind.<br />\nOkay, we should also discuss<br />\nthe solo project of Lee Renaldo,<br />\na guitarist with Sonic Youth. Mr.<br />\nRenaldo has taken a collection of<br />\nguitar sounds and put them onto<br />\ninfinite tape loops, the result being the album From Here to Infinity. This is another mindbender of an album. The longest<br />\ntrack comes in at about 90<br />\nseconds, but each track ends with<br />\na locked groove\u2014the needle will<br />\ncontinue to play the last few<br />\nseconds of the track, presumably<br />\nindefinitely. This means you have<br />\nto lift the needle onto the next<br />\ntrack, if you want. That's the important thing, because this is an<br />\nalbum that completely pushes our<br />\nunderstanding of sound to the<br />\nlimits. If you let the same track<br />\nrun for, oh, say five minutes, you<br />\nbegin hearing different things.<br />\nSonically, the sounds are exactly<br />\nthe same, but your ear begins to<br />\n<br />\ninterpret the sound differently.<br />\nSince each person hears differentr,<br />\nthings, and since the sounds<br />\nchange according to the speed at<br />\nwhich the record is played, and<br />\nthe EQ setting, what you have is<br />\nan infinite number of sounds.<br />\nAnd yes, each track does sound<br />\nlike something. In \"Destruction<br />\nSite,\" you can hear the hammers<br />\nand power tools, while \"Hard<br />\nLeft\" sounds like an instrumental song fragment.<br />\nThis is not an album you can<br />\npassively listen to\u2014what you put<br />\ninto it is what you bring out of it.<br />\nFor those willing to do the work,<br />\nthere's an awful lot for you to<br />\nhear.<br />\nBoth of these albums are on<br />\nSST Records, one of the few<br />\nlabels around that really encourages and supports the more<br />\nexperimental artists.

While at Ridgeview.<br />\nUdel worked extensively in adult<br />\nand adolescent psychiatry. He<br />\n<br />\nalso tocused on occupational<br />\npsychiatry, in which he primarily dealt with executives suffering<br />\nfrom work-related disorders.<br />\nPrior to his tenure at Ridgeview, Udel served as clinical<br />\ndirector supervising mental health<br />\nservices for adults at the 155-bed<br />\nRoyal Ottowa Hospital in Canada. In this capacity, he managed special treatment units for<br />\nalcohol and drug addictions, and<br />\ngeriatric psychiatry.

Sean Bramble<br />\nAcross the history of the Steinbrenner Yankees a line can be<br />\nsharply drawn, and that line is not<br />\ntoo difficult to discern. And since<br />\nthe line I wish to draw separates<br />\nthe last Yankee pennant from the<br />\nfutility of the past six years, it is<br />\nworth examining exactly what it<br />\nis that George has done wrong.<br />\nThe Yankees of 1976-1981<br />\nwere one of the most remarkable<br />\ndynasties of modern history, and<br />\nnot simply because of their huge<br />\nsuccess. Though they won five<br />\ndivisional titles in six years, the<br />\ntrue mark that Steinbrenner left<br />\nupon baseball was his canny free<br />\nagent shopping. His big spending<br />\nwas arrogant, it was also<br />\ncapitalist, but it was also triumphant. By signing tremendous<br />\namounts of free agents, he literally bought championships.<br />\nWhether this kind of action is<br />\nfair can be debated elsewhere.<br />\nWhat should be noted, though, is<br />\nthe quality of the free agents<br />\nGeorge signed. Roll the names<br />\nthrough the mind: Hunter,<br />\nJackson, Gossage, John, Winfield. . .so many Hall of Famers.<br />\nComplemented with a talent base<br />\nof Munson, Chambliss, Nettles,<br />\nRivers, Randolph, Dent, and<br />\nGuidry\u2014players brought up from<br />\nthe farm or acquired in trade\u2014it<br />\nis readily apparent that what<br />\n<br />\nGeorge had done was buy insurance. By collecting a team and<br />\na half, he thus bought his luck.<br />\nFast forward to 1982. That was<br />\nthe year in which, after seeing his<br />\nYankees humiliated in the World<br />\nSeries, George unveiled his new<br />\nYankees, a Yankee team<br />\npredicated upon speed, not<br />\npower. It was this team that<br />\nfeatured Dave Collins and Ken<br />\nGriffey in the outfield. A washedup John Mayberry was brought in<br />\nto play first. A Met hero (Lee<br />\nMazzilli) was signed. And the<br />\nprojected rotation included Roger<br />\nErickson and Mike Morgan.<br />\nThe question is, were any of<br />\nthese men conceivably great<br />\nplayers, of possible Hall of Fame<br />\ncredentials? Of course not. What<br />\nSteinbrenner has done is forget<br />\nthe means by which he won. Instead of pursuing great talent he<br />\nhas bought anyone available.<br />\nThink of the marginal majorleaguers he has imported: Omar<br />\nMoreno, Steve Kemp, Dale<br />\nBerra, Toby Harrah, and Claudell<br />\nWashington, to name only a few.<br />\nTo date, the only legitimately<br />\ngreat player George has acquired<br />\nis Rickey Henderson. Another<br />\nproblem of George's is the shuffling of the personnel. The<br />\nYankees of the 70's had welldefined positions, where<br />\neveryone knew where and how<br />\noften they would play. Partly that<br />\n<br />\nis a tribute to the managerial skills<br />\nof Billy Martin, but not entirely;<br />\nMartin has managed the Yankees<br />\ntwice in the 80's and he hasn't<br />\nbeen able to put an end to the<br />\ngame of musical chairs. In 1983<br />\nthey had a firstbaseman\u2014<br />\ncenterfielder (Griffey), a<br />\nfirstbaseman\u2014shortstop<br />\n(Smalley), and a firstbaseman\u2014<br />\nrightfielder (Mattingly). Shane<br />\nRawley, Dave Righetti, and<br />\nCharlie Hudson have never<br />\n<br />\nknown if they were to be in the<br />\nrotation or the bullpen. And as for<br />\nthe managers, well you know that<br />\nstory already.<br />\nThese two problems are a good<br />\npart of the reason why the<br />\nYankees have not won. I wish I<br />\ncould say that George seems to<br />\nhave learned his lesson, but I<br />\ndon't think I can.

It seems that no one enters the QM's favorite quizzes, but they do enter the semi-lame ones. I guess that is a reflection<br />\non his readership. Too bad. The QM is getting tired of typing MANY more GREAT questions than usual (25, not just 10), only to type the answers the next week. I don't even know if<br />\nanyone reads this, although the QMM (Quizmaster's Mother) did say she might start soon. Anyhow gang, rather than waste my time (and this cheap ink), I've decided to be a weenie<br />\njust like the rest of you, and not share my answers. You don't show me your's, I don't show you mine. If you don't like it, tough nuggies. Drop by the Gatehouse and tell me (or an esteemed<br />\ncolleague) that you are PO'd and maybe then in my Quizmaster generosity I might change my policy. Until then, Nanoo, Nanoo. By the way, if anybody really cares, solve for A, show<br />\nall work, and get your entries to the N-L Geekhouse by next Wednesday at 5 p.m. Trust me, this problem is easy. Wonder why.<br />\n<br />\nResults: The winner is Jim Morrell, the only entrant. To make matters worse, he is an ex-MCB TA. It's ironic, I had more questions right on a Mole Cell test and failed, while this guy<br />\ngets a case of beer for even less work. Go figure. Ask him for the answers, and if he's too busy, too bad. If you entered maybe your reward would be seeing the results here. But you<br />\ndidn't, so pooh on you. Grrr. Honestly gang, the Letters page gets more feedback than the good ole QM. What an idea. If you all have any militant friends, give them your entries, as<br />\nchances are they will end up here soon enough. Please write me. Ask for advice. Show me you care. SOB SOB BOO HOO.<br />\nP.S.: Guys and<br />\n<br />\ndames, I had the best P.S. written for this week, but I've since decided that you aren't worth it. Be good, and I'll tell you. Oh, and if you see Pat Doherty again this.<br />\nweek, give him a hug, it's his birthday. Tell him, \"The QM sent me.\" That way I'll know I have readers, and he'll<br />\nget hisiAlies.

The trustees completed the<br />\nportfolio changes by September<br />\n30.<br />\nOver the same nine months, investments in fixed income<br />\nsecurities and short-term money<br />\nmarket instruments rose by over<br />\nhalf, from twenty-five to thirtyeight percent.<br />\nThe market value of the EIP<br />\ndropped only eleven percent between September 30 and October<br />\n23, from $508 million to $447<br />\nmillion, while the Dow Jones<br />\ndropped 24.9 percent and the<br />\nStandard and Poor's 500 Index<br />\nfell 22.9 percent.<br />\nThe EIP's fixed income<br />\nsecurities, on the other hand,<br />\ngrew in value over the same three<br />\nweek period by 2.2 percent, a<br />\nfigure roughly equal to the<br />\ngrowth of the Shearson Lehman<br />\nGovernment/Corporate Bond Index. Sunshine attributed the increase in value of these securities<br />\nto the simultaneous decline in interest rates.<br />\nSunshine noted that the University investment managers' prudent equity investing helped keep<br />\nUniversity losses down.<br />\n\"Each investment manager<br />\nkeeps a portion of their allotment<br />\nin short term investments, so if<br />\nthey expect a downturn, [they]<br />\nhold more in markets as cash,\"<br />\nsaid Sunshine, referring to, the<br />\nthree managing companies that<br /><br />\ncourtesy of News and Information<br /><br />\nEugene Sunshine, treasurer of the Board of Trustees, who said that the<br />\nUniversity's Endowment Investment Pool lost only eleven percent of its<br />\nvalue during the recent Wall Street skid.<br /><br />\nthe University has hired to<br />\nmanage University money<br />\nallocated to stocks.<br />\nFor the week ending October<br />\n31, the market value of the EIP<br />\nrebounded slightly, to $460.3<br />\nmillion.

Originally published October 28, 1987.<br />\nSome college and university endowments took a<br />\nbeating on Wall Street last week, but over all the losses<br />\nwere not as severe as they might have been because<br />\nmany institutions had followed conservative investment<br />\nstrategies and sold their stocks before the market's nosedive.<br />\nJohn B. Cox, a spokesman for the National Association of College and University Business Officers, said<br />\nhe believed the stock-market gyrations would have little impact on higher-education finances generally.<br />\n\"College endowments are widely diversified, and, in<br />\nthe main, they're conservatively managed,\" he said.<br />\nFurthermore, he noted, only a small percentage of the<br />\nnation's 3,300 colleges even have major endowments.<br />\nIn the aggregate, endowments account for only a small<br />\nportion of college income. According to the latest federal<br />\nstatistics, endowment income provided 5.3 per cent of<br />\nthe revenue of private colleges and only 0.6 per cent<br /><br />\nof the revenue of public ones in 1985-86.<br />\nLeigh A. Jones, vice-president for business and<br />\nfinance at Berea College and chairman of the NACUBO<br />\ninvestment committee, said small endowments, which<br />\ntypically are invested in fixed-income securities, should<br />\nnot have been badly hurt by the October 19 stock-market<br />\nplunge. \"Schools with a large commitment to equity<br />\nwould have suffered the most, but they have also gained the most\" from the rise in stock prices of recent years,<br />\nhe said.<br />\n'Real Impact' Will Be on Gifts<br />\n\"I think the real impact on higher education is not<br />\nin the short-term losses on market value on the endowments, but the impact it will have on contributions,\"<br />\nsaid Roderick MacDougall, the treasurer of Harvard<br />\nUniversity. \"A half a trillion dollars was taken out of<br />\nthe economy.\"<br />\nEven so, while college finance officers were not<br />\npanicking, they were certainly shaken up by last week's<br /><br />\nSee INVESTMENTS, 4<br /><br />\n,b 1.!iiWo.,34UVI<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/3<br /><br />\nCouncil suggests own changes to add-drop policy<br />\nApproves nominations for MSE Symposium, Spring Fair chairpersons<br />\nCOUNCIL, from 1<br />\nwho dropped courses would<br />\nreceive \"W\" grades.

If public feeling against Coke becomes<br />\nstrong enough, then the demand for RC will<br />\ngrow and the supply of Coke will become increasingly limited.<br />\nIf, however, a Coke boycott is unable to command the attention of the majority, then at least<br />\nan alternative is available for those who so<br />\ndesire it.<br />\nThis compromise, however, holds significance for much more than simply the provision<br />\nof a choice of soft drink brands on moral<br />\ngrounds. It is a move which should be examined<br />\nwith the Human Climate Task Force Report in<br />\nmind.<br />\nThe Coalition had initially attempted to bring<br />\nPepsi products to campus to replace Coke. This<br />\nis a logical choice because Pepsi is the nation's<br />\n\"second\" cola. Not only does Pepsi have wide<br />\nconsumer recognition and is easily available,<br />\nbut a switch on this campus from Coke to its<br />\nleading competitor might have been a slap in<br />\nthe face for the Coca-Cola Company.<br /><br />\nHowever, the attempted switch to Pepsi<br />\nwound up being as odious for some members<br />\nof the Jewish Students Association as the continued use of Coke was for the Coalition. In<br />\nan effort to prevent further discord, the Coalition sought a compromise which would suit the<br />\ninterest of both organizations.<br />\nThe mutual respect and understanding promoted by the Task Force Report has shown<br />\nthrough in the Coalition's willingness to meet<br />\nthe needs of another campus group as well as<br />\nthose of their own.<br />\nFurthermore, Coalition members and RC<br />\norganizers Paul Genest and Bijoy Mathew have<br />\nemphasized how pleased they were with the<br />\ncooperation they received from Auxiliary<br />\nEnterprises on this effort. That they were so<br />\nwilling to give credit where credit was due further promotes a feeling of good will and<br />\ncooperation at Homewood.<br />\nFinally, the Coalition hopes to represent both<br />\nsides of the issue at its forthcoming forum on<br />\nthe use of Coca-Cola products. They plan to<br />\ninvite a Coca-Cola representative to speak as<br />\nwell as a South African rights activist. This<br />\nbalanced representation is an effective way of<br />\nencouraging people to learn more about CocaCola's involvement in South Africa.<br />\nThe decision to bring RC to Hopkins is a win<br />\nfor the Task Force Report as well as the Coalition. The methods used by the Coalition in striving for their cause may have forced them to<br />\ncompromise a bit, but their efforts to cooperate<br />\nand accomodate the interests of others set a<br />\nsolid example for other groups to follow.<br /><br />\nListening to Valid Criticism<br />\nAsk Hopkins undergrads about their proThe student has an obligation to discern from<br />\nfessors, or the Homewood faculty in general, lecture what the material is, as well as the<br />\nand the responses are very largely negative. organization with which it is presented.

We don't need detailed ac-<br /><br />\nSteve<br />\nBasta<br />\ncounts of cheating to know<br />\ndishonesty has become the norm<br />\nat Hopkins. We see it everyday<br />\non homework assignments, lab<br />\nreports, papers, and exams. Yet<br />\nno one does anything. Students<br />\nwalk out of exams talking about<br />\ncheating and those around them<br />\nignore it. We have come to accept<br />\nthis state of affairs and we have<br />\nlearned to \"play the game\"(read<br />\n\"lie and cheat\").<br />\nThis needn't continue. Communal academic integrity cannot<br />\nbe instituted overnight, but we<br />\ncan improve the climate on an individual basis. Each of us can<br />\nchoose to change our own approach and we can repeatedly encourage our friends to do the<br />\nsame. Simultaneously, we should<br />\nmake our feelings known to the<br />\nentire community. The Subcommittee on Moral Values stated in<br />\nthe Human Climate Task Force<br /><br />\nreport, \"Academic integrity<br />\nshould come out of shadows and<br />\nbe thought about, cared about,<br />\nconstantly.

If you know an individual<br />\nwho has cheated, say something<br />\nto him. If you don't say anything,<br />\nyou've given your implicit approval, and you have no right<br />\nthen to complain about that student's actions.<br />\nWe can't just sit and watch this<br />\nhappen. Each of us chose Johns<br />\nHopkins at least in part for its<br />\nacademic stature. As the premiere<br />\nresearch institution, JHU should<br />\nrepresent the ideals of individual<br />\nacademic pursuit.

It closely paralleled the<br />\nHonor Code it replaced, with the<br />\nexception that enforcement was<br />\nno longer left entirely to the<br />\nstudents and was designed to<br />\nrevert back to an Honor System<br />\nwhen circumstances permitted.<br />\nBut the undergraduate situation<br />\nis hardly different than it was 13<br />\nyears ago.

The same can be said for the<br />\ntouring production of Arsenic and<br />\nOld Lace at the Mechanic this<br />\nmonth. The ingredients look good<br />\nbut the effect is disappointingly<br />\nbland.<br />\nYou may have heard about the<br />\nproduction. After a brief Broadway stint, the show already<br />\ntraveled through most major<br />\nAmerican cities. The publicity<br />\nhas been great. The big draw is<br />\nthe \"all-star\" cast. After all, how<br />\noften do you get a chance to see<br />\nJean \"All In The Family\"<br />\nStapleton, Marion \"Happy<br />\nDays\" Ross, James \"Hawaii<br />\nFive-0\" MacArthur, Larry \"FTroop\" Storch, and Jonathan<br /><br />\n\"Dark Shadows\" FrTc-1- on stage<br />\ntogether?<br />\nAdd to that the hysterically funny plot of this popular play. The<br />\nplot centers around the Brewster<br />\nfamily. As Mortimer Brewster<br />\nsays, \"mental instability runs in<br />\nmy family. . . in fact, it practically<br />\ngallops!\" Abby and Martha<br />\nBrewster (played by Stapleton<br />\nand Ross, respectively) kill lonely<br />\nold men as an act of charity.<br />\nWhen straight man Mortimer<br />\n(MacArthur) discovers a body in<br />\na window seat in the home of his<br />\nsweet old aunts and learns of the<br />\neleven other corpses in the basement, the comedy of errors<br />\nbegins. The arrival of Mortimer's<br />\nlong-lost gangster brother,<br />\nJonathan (Frid), and the alcoholic<br />\nDr. Einstein (Storch) adds to the<br />\nconfusion, the comedy, and the<br />\nbody count.<br />\nSo, you've got five well-known<br />\ntelevision actors and actresses in<br />\none of the funniest plays ever<br /><br />\nwritten. What could be bad? Ohho-ho. That's just it. These are<br />\ntelevision actors and actresses.<br />\nPerhaps if ABC decided to make<br />\na Monday Night Movie version<br />\nof Arsenic and Old Lace the<br />\ncasting would be exemplary.<br />\nHowever, on stage this cast just<br />\ndoesn't cut the mustard.<br />\nIn all fairness, individually<br />\nsome of the actors and actresses<br />\nturn in fine performances. In a<br />\ncomedy, timing and interplay are<br />\nessential. Each member of the<br />\ncast is dependent upon the performances of others. One rotten actor spoils the bunch.<br />\nIn this case, the infectious actor is James MacArthur. His rendition of Mortimer is hollow and<br />\ninconsistent. His stage presence<br />\nis meek at best. In between lines,<br />\nhis character fades in and out like<br />\na TV set with bad reception. As<br />\na matter of fact, a bad reception<br />\nis what his performance deserves.<br />\nScenes between evil brother<br /><br />\n\u2022 Princess Bride:<br />\nYou have to go and take a friend<br />\nhas \"Fencing, fighting, torture,<br />\nescapes, revenge, giants,<br />\nThe Princess Bride is the sort monsters, chases, true love,<br />\nof movie a friend takes you to miracles.\"<br />\nThe film opens as a young boy<br />\nsee, and then you go a second<br />\ntime to take a friend of yours who is sick in bed. His grandfather<br />\nhasn't seen it yet. Then they go (Peter Falk) comes over to read<br />\na second time to take a friend of the boy a book. The book is The<br />\nBride<br />\nby<br />\nS.<br />\ntheirs. And so on. It's the feel- Princess<br />\ngood movie of the year. It's fun- Morgenstern, of course. The<br />\ngrandson goes from indifference<br />\nny, it's sad, it's goofy.<br />\nWilliam Goldman has adapted to rapt attention as the story<br />\nhis \"cult\" novel, which tells the progresses.<br />\nButtercup (Robin Wright) lives<br />\nstory of a classic book by S.<br />\nMorgenstern which Goldman on a farm in the country of<br />\nloved as a child. Rob Reiner has Florin. She orders the farm boy<br />\ncontinued his string of hits with around, who answers only, \"As<br />\nthis film. Bride has the sly you wish.\" The farm boy,<br />\ngoofiness of Spinal Tap and the Westley (Cary Elwes) really<br />\nwarmth of Stand By Me. It also means \"I love you\" when he says<br />\nby Loren Fox<br /><br />\nThe Princess Bride, Cary Elwes and Robin Wright.<br /><br />\nthis. They fall in love. He goes<br />\noff to find his fortune, but is<br />\nreported captured by the Dread<br />\nPirate Roberts, who leaves no<br />\nsurvivors.<br />\nFive years later, Buttercup still<br />\npines away for Westley, whom<br />\nshe believes dead. But she is being ordered to marry the country's Prince Humperdink (Chris<br />\nSarandon), the greatest hunter in<br />\nthe land. Soon after the wedding<br />\nis announced, Buttercup is kidnapped by a trio of villains: Fezzik (Andre the Giant) the slowwitted giant who loves rhymes;<br />\nInigo Montoya(Mandy Patinkin)<br />\nthe Spanish swordsman who is<br />\ntracking the six-fingered man<br />\nwho killed his father; Vizzini<br />\n(Wallace Shawn) the Sicilian selfproclaimed genius who leads the<br />\ntrio.<br />\nThey take her through the sea<br />\nof shrieking eels to the neighboring country of Guilder, to kill her<br />\nand leave her body there, thus<br />\ncausing a war. But they are pursued by a mysterious man in<br />\nblack. He follows them up the<br />\nCliffs of Insanity. He duels Inigo<br />\nand wins. He fights Fezzik and<br />\nbeats him. He carries it off well.<br />\nVizzini and survives. He steals<br />\nthe Princess, pursued by humperdink and his right-hand man,<br />\nCount Rugen (Christopher Guest)<br />\nthe six-fingered Count. Buttercup<br />\nlearns that the man in black is<br />\nreally Westley, who actually is<br />\nthe Dread Pirate Roberts. They<br />\nflee into the Fire Swamp, from<br />\nwhich no one has ever emerged.<br />\nTo say anymore would ruin the<br />\nmovie. Suffice to say, this<br />\nglorious sendup of swashbuckler<br />\nfilms (and homage to them) includes tributes to Westley's and<br />\nButtercup's true love. The hero<br />\ndies, the heroine is married, Inigo becomes a drunkard, but it<br />\nturns out all right in the end. And<br />\nall through, the grandson breaks<br /><br />\nJames MacArthur and Jonathan Frid in Arcenic and Old Lace.<br /><br />\nJonathan and his side-kick Dr.<br />\nEinstein enliven the play. Frid<br />\nand Storch play the parts for<br />\nlaughs. They establish a rapport<br />\nwith the audience from the moment they appear. Playing off<br />\neach other, they bring this production to the heights of comedy.<br />\nOn the whole, the main fault of<br />\nthe production is that it doesn't<br />\ntake enough risks. The actors<br />\ndownplay jokes that can and<br />\nshould be played up. This is<br />\nslapstick humor turned tongue-incheek. This subtle style of<br />\ndelivery muffles the jokes. Director Brian Murray might have<br />\npulled better performances out of<br /><br />\nhis \"all-star\" cast.<br />\nAbove all, the producers of<br />\nArsenic and Old Lace ought to be<br />\ncongratulated<br />\non<br />\ntheir<br />\nshrewdness. Their main goal is to<br />\ninvest their money soundly and<br />\nturn a profit. They have reached<br />\na flawless formula for success:<br />\nget some famous name actors,<br />\nadd a famous name play, and<br />\nsome great publicity staffmembers.

And take a friend.<br /><br />\nPhil Gochenour:<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\nOne of the greatest things to<br />\nhave emerged from the whole<br />\npunk movement was the notion of<br />\nexperimentation. Our understanding of what actually constituted<br />\na song, and our understhnding of<br />\nthe nature of music, underwent<br />\nradical changes. Artists like<br />\nLaurie Anderson and Pere Ubu,<br />\nand albums like Lou Reed's<br />\nMetal Machine Music, showed us<br />\nthat in every sound there is a kind<br />\nof music, and that any collection<br />\nof sounds might be a song.<br />\nProbably the most active group<br />\ntoday, in this respect, is Sonic<br />\nYouth. To Sonic Youth, the<br />\nguitar is merely an instrument for<br />\ncreating sound, not some sacred<br />\nobject that must be treated within<br />\ngiven parameters. In their quest<br />\nfor the ultimate sounds, they have<br />\nbashed guitars (they say Fenders<br />\nhold up best), used screwdrivers<br />\non the strings, inserted blocks of<br />\nwood under the bridges, and us-<br /><br />\nThe Flip Side<br /><br />\ned completely random tunings.<br />\nNow, you're asking, what does<br />\nall this sound like? It sounds pretty damn good, actually. On their<br />\nlatest album, Sister, the opening<br />\ntrack, \"Schizophrenia,\" could<br />\npass for being a mellow, jangly,<br />\nJoy Division/Smiths kind of song,<br />\nif it weren't for the off-balanced<br />\nlyrics and the slight dissonance<br />\nwithin the guitar chords. This,<br />\nhowever, is just a way to ease you<br />\ninto the madness that follows.<br />\nEach song on this album is, in its<br />\nown way, somewhat psychopathic, whether it's the repression of<br />\n.\"(I've got a) Catholic Block,\" or<br />\nthe outright psycho-killer insanity of \"Pacific Coast Highway.\"<br />\nTake the psycho, sometimes<br />\ncryptically disturbing lyrics, and<br />\nlink them up with music that combines headlong speed, heavily<br />\nfuzzed guitars, and hound from<br />\nhell vocals and what do you get?<br />\nTunes that will melt your brain<br />\ninto a grey ooze. Yeah, it's that<br />\ngood. Just one word of warning:<br /><br />\ndon't listen to this album under<br />\nthe influence, or you just might<br />\nlose .your mind.<br />\nOkay, we should also discuss<br />\nthe solo project of Lee Renaldo,<br />\na guitarist with Sonic Youth. Mr.<br />\nRenaldo has taken a collection of<br />\nguitar sounds and put them onto<br />\ninfinite tape loops, the result being the album From Here to Infinity. This is another mindbender of an album. The longest<br />\ntrack comes in at about 90<br />\nseconds, but each track ends with<br />\na locked groove\u2014the needle will<br />\ncontinue to play the last few<br />\nseconds of the track, presumably<br />\nindefinitely. This means you have<br />\nto lift the needle onto the next<br />\ntrack, if you want.

Sean Bramble<br />\nAcross the history of the Steinbrenner Yankees a line can be<br />\nsharply drawn, and that line is not<br />\ntoo difficult to discern. And since<br />\nthe line I wish to draw separates<br />\nthe last Yankee pennant from the<br />\nfutility of the past six years, it is<br />\nworth examining exactly what it<br />\nis that George has done wrong.<br />\nThe Yankees of 1976-1981<br />\nwere one of the most remarkable<br />\ndynasties of modern history, and<br />\nnot simply because of their huge<br />\nsuccess. Though they won five<br />\ndivisional titles in six years, the<br />\ntrue mark that Steinbrenner left<br />\nupon baseball was his canny free<br />\nagent shopping. His big spending<br />\nwas arrogant, it was also<br />\ncapitalist, but it was also triumphant. By signing tremendous<br />\namounts of free agents, he literally bought championships.<br />\nWhether this kind of action is<br />\nfair can be debated elsewhere.<br />\nWhat should be noted, though, is<br />\nthe quality of the free agents<br />\nGeorge signed. Roll the names<br />\nthrough the mind: Hunter,<br />\nJackson, Gossage, John, Winfield. . .so many Hall of Famers.<br />\nComplemented with a talent base<br />\nof Munson, Chambliss, Nettles,<br />\nRivers, Randolph, Dent, and<br />\nGuidry\u2014players brought up from<br />\nthe farm or acquired in trade\u2014it<br />\nis readily apparent that what<br /><br />\nGeorge had done was buy insurance. By collecting a team and<br />\na half, he thus bought his luck.<br />\nFast forward to 1982. That was<br />\nthe year in which, after seeing his<br />\nYankees humiliated in the World<br />\nSeries, George unveiled his new<br />\nYankees, a Yankee team<br />\npredicated upon speed, not<br />\npower. It was this team that<br />\nfeatured Dave Collins and Ken<br />\nGriffey in the outfield. A washedup John Mayberry was brought in<br />\nto play first. A Met hero (Lee<br />\nMazzilli) was signed. And the<br />\nprojected rotation included Roger<br />\nErickson and Mike Morgan.<br />\nThe question is, were any of<br />\nthese men conceivably great<br />\nplayers, of possible Hall of Fame<br />\ncredentials? Of course not. What<br />\nSteinbrenner has done is forget<br />\nthe means by which he won. Instead of pursuing great talent he<br />\nhas bought anyone available.<br />\nThink of the marginal majorleaguers he has imported: Omar<br />\nMoreno, Steve Kemp, Dale<br />\nBerra, Toby Harrah, and Claudell<br />\nWashington, to name only a few.<br />\nTo date, the only legitimately<br />\ngreat player George has acquired<br />\nis Rickey Henderson. Another<br />\nproblem of George's is the shuffling of the personnel. The<br />\nYankees of the 70's had welldefined positions, where<br />\neveryone knew where and how<br />\noften they would play. Partly that<br /><br />\nis a tribute to the managerial skills<br />\nof Billy Martin, but not entirely;<br />\nMartin has managed the Yankees<br />\ntwice in the 80's and he hasn't<br />\nbeen able to put an end to the<br />\ngame of musical chairs. In 1983<br />\nthey had a firstbaseman\u2014<br />\ncenterfielder (Griffey), a<br />\nfirstbaseman\u2014shortstop<br />\n(Smalley), and a firstbaseman\u2014<br />\nrightfielder (Mattingly). Shane<br />\nRawley, Dave Righetti, and<br />\nCharlie Hudson have never<br /><br />\nknown if they were to be in the<br />\nrotation or the bullpen. And as for<br />\nthe managers, well you know that<br />\nstory already.<br />\nThese two problems are a good<br />\npart of the reason why the<br />\nYankees have not won. I wish I<br />\ncould say that George seems to<br />\nhave learned his lesson, but I<br />\ndon't think I can.

It seems that no one enters the QM's favorite quizzes, but they do enter the semi-lame ones. I guess that is a reflection<br />\non his readership. Too bad. The QM is getting tired of typing MANY more GREAT questions than usual (25, not just 10), only to type the answers the next week. I don't even know if<br />\nanyone reads this, although the QMM (Quizmaster's Mother) did say she might start soon. Anyhow gang, rather than waste my time (and this cheap ink), I've decided to be a weenie<br />\njust like the rest of you, and not share my answers. You don't show me your's, I don't show you mine. If you don't like it, tough nuggies. Drop by the Gatehouse and tell me (or an esteemed<br />\ncolleague) that you are PO'd and maybe then in my Quizmaster generosity I might change my policy. Until then, Nanoo, Nanoo. By the way, if anybody really cares, solve for A, show<br />\nall work, and get your entries to the N-L Geekhouse by next Wednesday at 5 p.m. Trust me, this problem is easy. Wonder why.<br /><br />\nResults: The winner is Jim Morrell, the only entrant. To make matters worse, he is an ex-MCB TA. It's ironic, I had more questions right on a Mole Cell test and failed, while this guy<br />\ngets a case of beer for even less work. Go figure. Ask him for the answers, and if he's too busy, too bad. If you entered maybe your reward would be seeing the results here. But you<br />\ndidn't, so pooh on you. Grrr. Honestly gang, the Letters page gets more feedback than the good ole QM. What an idea. If you all have any militant friends, give them your entries, as<br />\nchances are they will end up here soon enough. Please write me. Ask for advice. Show me you care. SOB SOB BOO HOO.<br />\nP.S.: Guys and<br /><br />\ndames, I had the best P.S. written for this week, but I've since decided that you aren't worth it. Be good, and I'll tell you. Oh, and if you see Pat Doherty again this.<br />\nweek, give him a hug, it's his birthday. Tell him, \"The QM sent me.\" That way I'll know I have readers, and he'll<br />\nget hisiAlies.
