Aside from the fact that the<br />\nnew system has not been in effect long enough for the<br />\nUniversity to have received such requests on any students<br />\n. except those not enrolled in the traditional four-year<br />\npre-medical school program, in which case the student is aware,<br />\nas are those in Hopkins' own 2-5 program, of the need for<br />\nfreshman grades in grad school evaluations, the reversal appears<br />\nto undermine the very reason for which the policy was<br />\ninstituted.<br />\nIt is difficult to imagine an academic regimen more different<br />\nfrom that of an average secondary school than the pre-medical<br />\nprogram at Hopkins. Correspondingly, a period of adjustment is<br />\nnot only permissible but in some case crucial, to the ultimate<br />\nfulfillment of the student's goal of medical school acceptance.<br />\nHinging the release of first semester grades upon permission<br />\nof the student can only place him in the precarious position of<br />\nmaking 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' decisions<br />\n'which may not even be necessary. A 'request' for first semester<br />\n'freshman grades does not at all imply that the student will not<br />\nbe considered for admission without them, especially when<br />\nsubsequent academic records are in order, and when the<br />\nwithholding of initial grades is the result of an official<br />\nUniversity policy whose reasoning is taken seriously by those<br />\ncharged with its enforcement.<br />\n<br />\nLife (in the dorms) is a carnival, believe it or not<br />\neach residence; one can only speak<br />\nfrom personal experience.

I'm sure Eric<br />\nRasmussen learned quite abit<br />\nabout this when he \"elected\"<br />\nhimself representative of the<br />\nHopkins student body when Dean<br />\nGeorge Benton needed a student<br />\naid. Who complained in Germany<br />\nin 1933?<br />\nAs for the Student Union, why<br />\ndon't we have ping-pong tables?<br />\nPossibly that is in the planning, if<br />\nit is not, I urge it to be. The pong<br />\ntables in the gym; at the other<br />\nend of campus, are certainly not<br />\nvery accessible between classes as<br />\nare the pinball machines in the<br />\nUnion. I certainly would not feel<br />\nvery comfortable using those in<br />\nthe Black Student Union which is<br />\ntheoretically open to other<br />\nstudents as well as blacks. The fee<br />\ncharged for using the pool tables<br />\nin the Union is ridiculous. Why<br />\nshould I pay for those tables<br />\nwhile I don't need to leave<br />\n<br />\nanything but my I.D. for those in<br />\nthe Social Lounge and gym? For<br />\nthe last 21<br />\n/<br />\n2 years, people have<br />\nbeen asking for new tables in the<br />\nlounge and gym. The point of the<br />\nUnion ought not to be making a<br />\n{<br />\n<br />\n<<br />\nIL<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n11IG<br />\n<br />\nstudents. If we pay for the pool<br />\ntables in the Union when there<br />\n<br />\nare free ones<br />\nelsewhere on<br />\ncampus, why aren't we paying for<br />\nthe T.V. now installed in Levering<br />\n(which I laud) when there is a<br />\nfree one elsewhere on campus?<br />\n(We could even go so far as<br />\ngetting the type of chair-T.V.'s<br />\nthat are in Greyhound bus<br />\nstations.) I won't discuss the<br />\nunfair hiring procedures employed<br />\nat \"The Desk.\" I'm not even<br />\ngoing to discuss the lack of<br />\nhousing, the total absurdity of<br />\navailable parking, or the extreme<br />\nlack of efficiency in our Gilman<br />\nbank or the ridiculous letters in<br />\nthe News-Letter.<br />\nSo this is a few of the things<br />\nthat bother me. I certainly hope<br />\nthat some idiot does not say,<br />\n\"Well, why don't you try to<br />\nchange it if it bothers you?\" This<br />\nis meant as \"input from the<br />\nstudent body\" that our dear<br />\nelected Student Council president<br />\nhas been yelling for.

They are<br />\nintended to disrupt dormitory life<br />\nin general, inflict a sort of<br />\nubiquitous malaise like the<br />\nmythological harpies. These<br />\n<br />\nchatter is usually of-a surprisingly<br />\nferocious nature. Students find it<br />\nnecessary only when within direct<br />\nearshot of a campus policeman to<br />\nmake sarcastic comments<br />\nconcerning campus security or<br />\ncomment fleetingly on the<br />\n\"electron-like velocity\" with which<br />\nthe often rotund campus<br />\npolicemen could pursue a<br />\nhypothetical rapist.<br />\nI realized that. since dormitory<br />\nlife smacks of unreality, childish<br />\nbehavior was to be expected and,<br />\nto some degree, tolerated. Never<br />\ndid I hypothesize that I myself<br />\nwould engage in this prepubescent<br />\nhorseplay. I must admit that the<br />\ntemptation to hernietically seal a<br />\nhousemate's door with shaving<br />\ncream is often overwhelming. I<br />\nhave aquiesced. I have<br />\ncondescended to the level of<br />\n<br />\ncertain capacity for destruction<br />\nwhen played in the narrow<br />\nconfines of a dormitory hall.<br />\nIndoor games of frisbee are<br />\nexceptionally dangerous.

During<br />\nthe rare moments when the<br />\ndormitory residents are not<br />\nsleeping, studying or engaging in<br />\nthe aforementioned anti-activities,<br />\nthey wander about in a sort of<br />\nmindless utopia. This free time is<br />\ndivided between compulsive trips<br />\nto the mail room, ritual voyages to<br />\nthe snack bar and outdoor chats.<br />\nThe latter is of particularly great<br />\nsignificance.<br />\nThese informal talks usually<br />\ntake place on the benches in the<br />\nnew dorm complex.

The Hopkins<br />\nteam has not been beaten in its<br />\nlast 3 outings and after the dust<br />\nhad cleared from this non-league<br />\ncontest, the Blue Jays edged<br />\nGettysburg 1-0.<br />\nThe close final score is an<br />\nexcellent indication of how<br />\nqvenly played the game was.<br />\nFrom the opening kick-off, a fast<br />\npace was established as both<br />\nGettysburg and Hopkins moved<br />\nthe ball quickly on offense. Each<br />\nteam pressed the other's defense<br />\nas they exchanged scoring<br />\nopportunities throughout the<br />\nentire first half.<br />\nThe lone score in the game<br />\ncame early at 8:31 as Hopkins<br />\nwas driving on offense, right wing<br />\nFrank Curnoles crossed a high<br />\npass from the right side outside<br />\nthe goal to lineman John<br />\nHartman, who was perfectly<br />\npositioned in front of the goal.<br />\nHartman headed the ball into the<br />\ngoal. It was a perfectly executed<br />\nplay and it proved to be the only<br />\ngoal Hopkins needed to win.<br />\nHopkins made the goal stand<br />\nup as the offensive unit<br />\ncontrolled the action in the game<br />\n<br />\nthrough accurate passing and<br />\ndriving shots. Gettysburg also<br />\nmounted its own scoring threats,_<br />\nbut the Blue Jay defense did not<br />\nallow the Gettysburg linemen to<br />\npenetrate near the goal. This<br />\nforced Gettysburg to shoot long<br />\nhard outside shots, while<br />\nHopkins goalie Keith Naunheim<br />\nscooped them up as saves.<br />\nFor Hopkins, exactly the<br />\nopposite was true. Hopkins' ball<br />\ncontrol allowed them to drive<br />\ndeep into Gettysburg territory<br />\nwhere Blue Jay linemen were<br />\nable to get off close-range shots.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense was led by<br />\nPhil Heiter and John Hartman,<br />\nwho took the majority of the<br />\nshots.<br />\nThe game was tense as both<br />\nCoach Oliver, the Hopkins<br />\nmentor, and the Gettysburg<br />\ncoach paced the side-lines<br />\nnervously, shouting instructions<br />\nto their players.<br />\nWhen the horn sounded ending<br />\nthe first half at score 1-0, both<br />\nteams,were ready to take a<br />\nbreather as they anticipated a<br />\ntough second half. The statistics<br />\nshowed how close the game was.<br />\nHopkins took 7 shots on goal and<br />\nGettysburg had 9. Goalie Keith<br />\nNaunheim grabbed 7 saves on the<br />\ndazzling Hopkins defense that<br />\nthwarted all Gettysburg scoring<br />\n<br />\nthreats.<br />\nThe second half was a<br />\nduplicate of the first, as once<br />\nagain both Hopkins and<br />\nGettysburg continued to switch<br />\noffensive attacks.<br />\nBut it appeared as though<br />\nHopkins slowed down its<br />\noffensive game and played much<br />\nmore cautiously. This enabled<br />\nGettysburg to just put more<br />\npressure on the Hopkins defense<br />\nas they drove for the goal.<br />\nThis was strikingly apparent in<br />\none Gettysburg threat. Their<br />\noffense had driven deep into<br />\nHopkins territory and a<br />\nGettysburg lineman had banged a<br />\nline drive shot from close range.<br />\nBut goalie Naunheim turned in<br />\nthe defensive sparkler of the day<br />\nas he ranged to his right to grab<br />\nthe goalward shot.<br />\nAt the very end of the game,<br />\nHopkins turned on the offense<br />\nand kept excellent control of the<br />\nball to protect that precious one<br />\ngoal lead. Gettysburg could not<br />\nmount another drive as Hopkins<br />\ndominated.

The origin of<br />\nMaryPIRG was a proposal by<br />\nRalph Nader made three years<br />\nago and implemented in Oregon<br />\nand Minnesota, calling for college<br />\nstudents to tax themselves in<br />\norder to raise revenues for public<br />\ninterest projects.<br />\n\"MaryPIRG attempts to<br />\norganize college students in<br />\nviable groups to raise money and<br />\norganize manpower, in order to<br />\nhire professionals, including<br />\n<br />\nColumbia Hospital<br />\n<br />\nplanning began, that their facility<br />\nwould not be prepared to serve as<br />\nsuch due to its research and<br />\npre-paid health care programs.<br />\nLocal physicians, who heavily<br />\nfavored the Bon Secours proposal<br />\nin a poll of the Howard County<br />\nMedical Society, recently termed<br />\nthe Hopkins policy reversal as<br />\n\"symptomatic of (Hopkins')<br />\ndesire to run the whole show.\"<br />\nBut Heyssel said the<br />\nphysicians' opposition to an<br />\nexpanded Columbia Hospital was<br />\nnot due to Hopkins' current<br />\ndominance of the county's health<br />\ncare facilities, but was the result<br />\nof a differing professional<br />\nphilosophy on health care<br />\nprograms.<br />\n\"Many doctors oppose any<br />\ntype of closed, pre-paid medical<br />\nclinic program,\" he said. \"Some<br />\nobject more than others and are<br />\nmore vocal about their<br />\nobjections.\"<br />\n<br />\nlawyers and lobbiests, to<br />\npromote projects in the public<br />\ninterest,\" said Mack Lee.<br />\nAccording to Lee, the Hopkins<br />\ndivision of<br />\nMaryPIRG has<br />\nnevertheless been dormant of late<br />\ndue to a number of factors.<br />\nHe attributes some of this<br />\ninactivity to the absence of an<br />\ninterested and qualified leader on<br />\ncampus to serve as local project<br />\ndirector.

Aside from the fact that the<br />\nnew system has not been in effect long enough for the<br />\nUniversity to have received such requests on any students<br />\n. except those not enrolled in the traditional four-year<br />\npre-medical school program, in which case the student is aware,<br />\nas are those in Hopkins' own 2-5 program, of the need for<br />\nfreshman grades in grad school evaluations, the reversal appears<br />\nto undermine the very reason for which the policy was<br />\ninstituted.<br />\nIt is difficult to imagine an academic regimen more different<br />\nfrom that of an average secondary school than the pre-medical<br />\nprogram at Hopkins. Correspondingly, a period of adjustment is<br />\nnot only permissible but in some case crucial, to the ultimate<br />\nfulfillment of the student's goal of medical school acceptance.<br />\nHinging the release of first semester grades upon permission<br />\nof the student can only place him in the precarious position of<br />\nmaking 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' decisions<br />\n'which may not even be necessary. A 'request' for first semester<br />\n'freshman grades does not at all imply that the student will not<br />\nbe considered for admission without them, especially when<br />\nsubsequent academic records are in order, and when the<br />\nwithholding of initial grades is the result of an official<br />\nUniversity policy whose reasoning is taken seriously by those<br />\ncharged with its enforcement.<br /><br />\nLife (in the dorms) is a carnival, believe it or not<br />\neach residence; one can only speak<br />\nfrom personal experience.

I do not want<br />\nto complain about the ticket here,<br />\nthough, but rather about the<br />\nappeals process. I received the<br />\nverdict by mail from the Appeals<br />\nCommittee \u2014 guilty of illegal<br />\nparking in the first degree. I'm<br />\nsure they had their reasons for<br />\nmy guiltiness, but in their verdict,<br />\nthey omitted the most important<br />\npart: why I was guilty. This is the<br />\nbasis upon which our fair<br />\ndemocracy is based, that of<br />\nnon-arbitrary rulings. If I am<br />\nguilty, I will gleefully accept my<br />\npunishment, but before I do, I<br />\nwant to know why I am guilty.<br />\nThe letter I received instructed<br />\nme only as to my punishment,<br />\nnot as to the reasoning behind<br />\ntheir verdict.

I'm sure Eric<br />\nRasmussen learned quite abit<br />\nabout this when he \"elected\"<br />\nhimself representative of the<br />\nHopkins student body when Dean<br />\nGeorge Benton needed a student<br />\naid. Who complained in Germany<br />\nin 1933?<br />\nAs for the Student Union, why<br />\ndon't we have ping-pong tables?<br />\nPossibly that is in the planning, if<br />\nit is not, I urge it to be. The pong<br />\ntables in the gym; at the other<br />\nend of campus, are certainly not<br />\nvery accessible between classes as<br />\nare the pinball machines in the<br />\nUnion. I certainly would not feel<br />\nvery comfortable using those in<br />\nthe Black Student Union which is<br />\ntheoretically open to other<br />\nstudents as well as blacks. The fee<br />\ncharged for using the pool tables<br />\nin the Union is ridiculous. Why<br />\nshould I pay for those tables<br />\nwhile I don't need to leave<br /><br />\nanything but my I.D. for those in<br />\nthe Social Lounge and gym? For<br />\nthe last 21<br />\n/<br />\n2 years, people have<br />\nbeen asking for new tables in the<br />\nlounge and gym. The point of the<br />\nUnion ought not to be making a<br />\n{<br /><br />\n&lt;<br />\nIL<br />\n,<br /><br />\n11IG<br /><br />\nstudents. If we pay for the pool<br />\ntables in the Union when there<br /><br />\nare free ones<br />\nelsewhere on<br />\ncampus, why aren't we paying for<br />\nthe T.V. now installed in Levering<br />\n(which I laud) when there is a<br />\nfree one elsewhere on campus?<br />\n(We could even go so far as<br />\ngetting the type of chair-T.V.'s<br />\nthat are in Greyhound bus<br />\nstations.) I won't discuss the<br />\nunfair hiring procedures employed<br />\nat \"The Desk.\" I'm not even<br />\ngoing to discuss the lack of<br />\nhousing, the total absurdity of<br />\navailable parking, or the extreme<br />\nlack of efficiency in our Gilman<br />\nbank or the ridiculous letters in<br />\nthe News-Letter.<br />\nSo this is a few of the things<br />\nthat bother me. I certainly hope<br />\nthat some idiot does not say,<br />\n\"Well, why don't you try to<br />\nchange it if it bothers you?\" This<br />\nis meant as \"input from the<br />\nstudent body\" that our dear<br />\nelected Student Council president<br />\nhas been yelling for.

They are<br />\nintended to disrupt dormitory life<br />\nin general, inflict a sort of<br />\nubiquitous malaise like the<br />\nmythological harpies. These<br /><br />\nchatter is usually of-a surprisingly<br />\nferocious nature. Students find it<br />\nnecessary only when within direct<br />\nearshot of a campus policeman to<br />\nmake sarcastic comments<br />\nconcerning campus security or<br />\ncomment fleetingly on the<br />\n\"electron-like velocity\" with which<br />\nthe often rotund campus<br />\npolicemen could pursue a<br />\nhypothetical rapist.<br />\nI realized that. since dormitory<br />\nlife smacks of unreality, childish<br />\nbehavior was to be expected and,<br />\nto some degree, tolerated. Never<br />\ndid I hypothesize that I myself<br />\nwould engage in this prepubescent<br />\nhorseplay. I must admit that the<br />\ntemptation to hernietically seal a<br />\nhousemate's door with shaving<br />\ncream is often overwhelming. I<br />\nhave aquiesced. I have<br />\ncondescended to the level of<br /><br />\ncertain capacity for destruction<br />\nwhen played in the narrow<br />\nconfines of a dormitory hall.<br />\nIndoor games of frisbee are<br />\nexceptionally dangerous.

During<br />\nthe rare moments when the<br />\ndormitory residents are not<br />\nsleeping, studying or engaging in<br />\nthe aforementioned anti-activities,<br />\nthey wander about in a sort of<br />\nmindless utopia. This free time is<br />\ndivided between compulsive trips<br />\nto the mail room, ritual voyages to<br />\nthe snack bar and outdoor chats.<br />\nThe latter is of particularly great<br />\nsignificance.<br />\nThese informal talks usually<br />\ntake place on the benches in the<br />\nnew dorm complex.

I hypothesized that the<br />\nAndy Griffith I had seen was not a<br />\nregular broadcast but rather some<br />\nancient one which had rebounded<br />\noff some Corner of the ionosphere<br />\nand was magically picked up by<br />\nthe dorm television.

The Hopkins<br />\nteam has not been beaten in its<br />\nlast 3 outings and after the dust<br />\nhad cleared from this non-league<br />\ncontest, the Blue Jays edged<br />\nGettysburg 1-0.<br />\nThe close final score is an<br />\nexcellent indication of how<br />\nqvenly played the game was.<br />\nFrom the opening kick-off, a fast<br />\npace was established as both<br />\nGettysburg and Hopkins moved<br />\nthe ball quickly on offense. Each<br />\nteam pressed the other's defense<br />\nas they exchanged scoring<br />\nopportunities throughout the<br />\nentire first half.<br />\nThe lone score in the game<br />\ncame early at 8:31 as Hopkins<br />\nwas driving on offense, right wing<br />\nFrank Curnoles crossed a high<br />\npass from the right side outside<br />\nthe goal to lineman John<br />\nHartman, who was perfectly<br />\npositioned in front of the goal.<br />\nHartman headed the ball into the<br />\ngoal. It was a perfectly executed<br />\nplay and it proved to be the only<br />\ngoal Hopkins needed to win.<br />\nHopkins made the goal stand<br />\nup as the offensive unit<br />\ncontrolled the action in the game<br /><br />\nthrough accurate passing and<br />\ndriving shots. Gettysburg also<br />\nmounted its own scoring threats,_<br />\nbut the Blue Jay defense did not<br />\nallow the Gettysburg linemen to<br />\npenetrate near the goal. This<br />\nforced Gettysburg to shoot long<br />\nhard outside shots, while<br />\nHopkins goalie Keith Naunheim<br />\nscooped them up as saves.<br />\nFor Hopkins, exactly the<br />\nopposite was true. Hopkins' ball<br />\ncontrol allowed them to drive<br />\ndeep into Gettysburg territory<br />\nwhere Blue Jay linemen were<br />\nable to get off close-range shots.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense was led by<br />\nPhil Heiter and John Hartman,<br />\nwho took the majority of the<br />\nshots.<br />\nThe game was tense as both<br />\nCoach Oliver, the Hopkins<br />\nmentor, and the Gettysburg<br />\ncoach paced the side-lines<br />\nnervously, shouting instructions<br />\nto their players.<br />\nWhen the horn sounded ending<br />\nthe first half at score 1-0, both<br />\nteams,were ready to take a<br />\nbreather as they anticipated a<br />\ntough second half. The statistics<br />\nshowed how close the game was.<br />\nHopkins took 7 shots on goal and<br />\nGettysburg had 9. Goalie Keith<br />\nNaunheim grabbed 7 saves on the<br />\ndazzling Hopkins defense that<br />\nthwarted all Gettysburg scoring<br /><br />\nthreats.<br />\nThe second half was a<br />\nduplicate of the first, as once<br />\nagain both Hopkins and<br />\nGettysburg continued to switch<br />\noffensive attacks.<br />\nBut it appeared as though<br />\nHopkins slowed down its<br />\noffensive game and played much<br />\nmore cautiously. This enabled<br />\nGettysburg to just put more<br />\npressure on the Hopkins defense<br />\nas they drove for the goal.<br />\nThis was strikingly apparent in<br />\none Gettysburg threat. Their<br />\noffense had driven deep into<br />\nHopkins territory and a<br />\nGettysburg lineman had banged a<br />\nline drive shot from close range.<br />\nBut goalie Naunheim turned in<br />\nthe defensive sparkler of the day<br />\nas he ranged to his right to grab<br />\nthe goalward shot.<br />\nAt the very end of the game,<br />\nHopkins turned on the offense<br />\nand kept excellent control of the<br />\nball to protect that precious one<br />\ngoal lead. Gettysburg could not<br />\nmount another drive as Hopkins<br />\ndominated.

The origin of<br />\nMaryPIRG was a proposal by<br />\nRalph Nader made three years<br />\nago and implemented in Oregon<br />\nand Minnesota, calling for college<br />\nstudents to tax themselves in<br />\norder to raise revenues for public<br />\ninterest projects.<br />\n\"MaryPIRG attempts to<br />\norganize college students in<br />\nviable groups to raise money and<br />\norganize manpower, in order to<br />\nhire professionals, including<br /><br />\nColumbia Hospital<br /><br />\nplanning began, that their facility<br />\nwould not be prepared to serve as<br />\nsuch due to its research and<br />\npre-paid health care programs.<br />\nLocal physicians, who heavily<br />\nfavored the Bon Secours proposal<br />\nin a poll of the Howard County<br />\nMedical Society, recently termed<br />\nthe Hopkins policy reversal as<br />\n\"symptomatic of (Hopkins')<br />\ndesire to run the whole show.\"<br />\nBut Heyssel said the<br />\nphysicians' opposition to an<br />\nexpanded Columbia Hospital was<br />\nnot due to Hopkins' current<br />\ndominance of the county's health<br />\ncare facilities, but was the result<br />\nof a differing professional<br />\nphilosophy on health care<br />\nprograms.<br />\n\"Many doctors oppose any<br />\ntype of closed, pre-paid medical<br />\nclinic program,\" he said. \"Some<br />\nobject more than others and are<br />\nmore vocal about their<br />\nobjections.\"<br /><br />\nlawyers and lobbiests, to<br />\npromote projects in the public<br />\ninterest,\" said Mack Lee.<br />\nAccording to Lee, the Hopkins<br />\ndivision of<br />\nMaryPIRG has<br />\nnevertheless been dormant of late<br />\ndue to a number of factors.<br />\nHe attributes some of this<br />\ninactivity to the absence of an<br />\ninterested and qualified leader on<br />\ncampus to serve as local project<br />\ndirector.
