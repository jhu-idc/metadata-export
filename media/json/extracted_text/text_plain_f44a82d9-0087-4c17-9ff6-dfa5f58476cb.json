FINDLAY FRENCH,<br />\nEditor-in-Chief of theN4ws-LETTER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nWhen the Lacrosse Team of 1902 had played its last game, the members of that<br />\norganization decided that each and every one of them would, if able to do so, either<br />\nreturn and coach the Johns Hopkins Lacrosse teams of the future or lend their assistance in some practical manner. Stich men as have been located in Baltimore and whose<br />\nvocation in life has allowed them to do so, have given the young men the benefit of<br />\ntheir experience, but others have been compelled to content themselves with rooting<br />\nfrom the side-lines or taking an occasional \"Here's to Hopkins\" when the news of<br />\nvictory has reached them by mail or telegram.<br />\nNow, knowing that the difficulty of getting out freshmen for the University Lacrosse team still prevails as it did during the time that we were at College, we are<br />\nprepared to make a start, although in but a small way, to give our assistance to the<br />\nteams which are to be developed, with the hope that other of the alumni may be moved<br />\nto do what in their hearts they are ready to do\u2014that is, give practical support to our<br />\nathletic teams.<br />\nWe herewith offer to the student body of the Johns Hopkins University twelve<br />\nloving cups\u2014these to be presented to the players of the team coming out victorious in<br />\na series of three lacrosse games to be played between the junior and freshman classes.<br />\nThe conditions to govern the contest are to be as follows:<br />\nI.<br />\nThe parties to the contest shall be twelve players picked from the junior class on<br />\nthe one side; and twelve players picked from the freshman and sub-freshman classes<br />\non the other.<br />\nAny dispute as to the eligibility of any student shall be settled by the Board of<br />\nGovernors of the Athletic Association.<br />\nIlL<br />\nThe games may be played on any field the contesting classes may select.<br />\nIV.<br />\nin<br />\nMarch<br />\nand up to the middle of April, and on such<br />\nplayed<br />\nto<br />\nbe<br />\ngames<br />\nare<br />\nThe<br />\nthe University lacrosse team.<br />\npracticeof<br />\nthe<br />\ndates as not to interfere with<br />\nV.<br />\nAll three games must be played.<br />\nVI.<br />\nIf it should so happen that two or more men would be called on to fill the same<br />\nposition in the same or different games throughout the series, it shall devolve on the<br />\nclass organization to select the player entitled to receive the prize.<br />\nWe suggest that the two classes appoint their respective captains at their earliest<br />\nopportunity, so that these men may see to it that their candidates report to practice<br />\nwith the 'Varsity Squad and thus raise the standard of the class teams.<br />\nShould any of the conditions set down above not seem feasible to the undergraduates, we will be glad to change them, so as to bring them in harmony with any<br />\nideas which may be suggested to us.<br />\nIn conclusion, we wish to add, that this, our offer for the Spring of 1906, is in the<br />\nnature of a trial. If it meets with the approval of the student body and arouses the<br />\nproper interest in the Freshman class, we hope to renew our offer from year to year.<br />\nTrusting that you will give this matter your attention in the columns of the<br />\nNEws-LETTER, we remain,<br />\nYours resp ectfully,<br />\nThe Lacrosse Team of 1902:<br />\nB.

We believe first of all that<br />\nthe plan proposed is an excellent one, and<br />\nthat it will meet the hearty approval of the<br />\nentire undergraduate body. Moreover, the<br />\noffer is not hampered by any condition which<br />\nwill in the least interfere with its success.<br />\nWe think that the presentation of individual<br />\nloving cups instead of the usual team trophy<br />\nwill prove an additional incentive toward<br />\nthe development of two excellent twelves.<br />\nThe undergraduate body of the Johns Hopkins should feel deeply grateful to the generosity of those men who have made such<br />\na splendid offer in the interest both of graduate and that of lacrosse. The best method<br />\nof showing this appreciation will be for the<br />\nJunior and Freshmen classes to take definite<br />\nand immediate action toward the formation<br />\nof such teams immediately after the Christmas vacation.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nThe annual meetings of the American Historical Association, the American Economic<br />\nAssociation, and the American Political<br />\nScience Association, will be held at this University between December 26th and 29th.<br />\nIt is needless to say that the conferences will<br />\nbe most interesting, and for the benefit of<br />\n<br />\nthose who desire to avail themselves of the<br />\nprivileges of the meetings, we publish the<br />\nprograms, almost in full. The addresses<br />\nwill be of much importance, and from the<br />\nbrilliant array of men who are to speak,<br />\neverything points to a successful conference.<br />\nThe public is cordially invited.<br />\nN the early part of the Autumn, the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER in an editorial advocated<br />\nthe establishment of a pay-station telephone booth in the basement of McCoy Hall<br />\nfor the convenience of students, but as yet<br />\nno definite steps have been taken to carry<br />\nout the idea. As we tried to emphasize before, the placing of a telephone in a place<br />\neasily accessible to all the students would be<br />\nof untold service not only to the students<br />\nthemselves but to the faculty. Many a lateness at lectures may be accounted for by the<br />\nfact that the tardy one was forced to go the<br />\ndistance of a block or more in order to send<br />\nan important message by telephone. The<br />\ntelephone companies, we believe, make no<br />\ncharges for the installation of a public telephone in a public place, and we are confident that the patronage of such a phone<br />\nwould amply justify our demand. We earnestly call the attention of the proper authorities to this request, which, we believe, is<br />\nmade in the interest of the entire student<br />\nbody.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nrecent editorial in the New York<br />\n\"Evening Press\" draws some interesting inferences from statistics in<br />\nregard to the amount and to the nature of<br />\nliterature read by college students. According to the \"Evening Press,\" most of the<br />\nreading indulged in by the average undergraduate consists in th eliterature of the day,<br />\nsuch as may be obtained from newsrpapers<br />\nand magazines. Athletics seem to be the<br />\nitem of first importance, but other branches<br />\nof current news are not neglected. What<br />\nappears to be slighted is the standard literature o fthe language. However, in direct<br />\ncontrast with these inferences, may be noted<br />\nthe establishment, at one of our Western<br />\nniversities, of a course on \"Current Events.\"<br />\nFrom conditions now prevailing at this<br />\nUniversity\u2014conditions inseparably connected with the plan of instruction\u2014we do not<br />\nbelieve that the undergraduates spend too<br />\nmuch time keeping themselves informed<br />\nwith the march of presetn events, and, if<br />\nanything, they err on the side of too great<br />\na neglect of the \"world to-day.\" Any required course on current events would be<br />\nmost unwise, but an elective one, treating<br />\nthe serious questions of the day, would not<br />\nonly be interesting, but would be genuinely<br />\nenlightening.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nREPENTENT.<br />\nNo joyous, gladsome song I sing,<br />\nWhen Xmas comes around,<br />\nIn fact I'm quite the saddest man,<br />\nThat ever could be found;<br />\nFor how can one be cheerful,<br />\nAnd how can one be gay,<br />\nWith several hundred presents,<br />\nWhich he must give away?<br />\nYou see there's Dol, and Polly,<br />\nAnd Grace, and Isabel,<br />\nAnd Elsie, Jean, and Molly,<br />\nAnd Nance, and pretty Nell.<br />\nAnd then, of course, there's Hetty,<br />\nAnd Eunice sweet, and Dot;<br />\nThat mustn't be forgot?<br />\nI've written verses to each one,<br />\nAnd sung their praises o'Cr,<br />\nI've called them by each charming name,<br />\nA thousand times or more;<br />\nBut now with Xmas coming,<br />\nI am repentant true,<br />\nFor with so many presents,<br />\nWhy, what's a man to do?<br />\nAnd then there's Flo, and Tessie,<br />\nLouise, and Phyllis dear,<br />\nAnd Janet, Edna, Bessie,<br />\nMust also count, I fear,<br />\nAnd then, oh pshaw, there's Mary,<br />\nAnd Marjie sweet, and Sue,<br />\nWho always were contrary,<br />\nWhene'er I tried to woo.<br />\n<br />\nHE Dance Committee has set the date<br />\nof the next dance for January 12.<br />\nThough the first dance was successful in almost every respect; still the committee does not intend to \"rest on its laurels,\" but expects to use every possible effort to make the next dance even more sucOld Santa Claus you say is good,<br />\ncessful than the last one.

In fact, it was<br />\nonly as he trudged home through the heavy<br />\nsnow that he realized that this was truly<br />\nChristmas eve, when everyone was supposedly happy and joyous. He remembered with<br />\nwhat eager expectancy he had looked forward to it when he was a boy, and a feeling<br />\nof sadness crept over him to think that those<br />\nhappy days of childhood were but a memory.<br />\nHe recalled with a keen pang of regret how<br />\nhe had always longed for a home in the<br />\ncountry\u2014how it had been the dream of a<br />\nlifetime\u2014and the thought that years before<br />\nsome kindly disposed friends, more blessed<br />\nwith this world's goods than he, had presented him with a lot, only seemed to make<br />\nhis sorrow more real. Truly it was the irony<br />\nof fate.<br />\nWith these recollections burning in his<br />\nbrain he entered his home, and totally ignoring his evening meal, went early to bed.<br />\nAfter a long while he managed to fall asleep,<br />\nbut the first light of dawn was sufficient to<br />\nawake him. With half an eye he was able<br />\nto distinguish a stocking hanging over his<br />\nmantelpiece.<br />\nHe was startled. What on earth could it<br />\nmean? . Quickly jumping out of bed, he<br />\nrushed toward the fireplace.<br />\nYes\u2014there<br />\nsure enough was a stocking, though as a<br />\nmatter of fact it hung very limply to its<br />\nfastening. Nevertheless he thrust his hand<br />\ndown to the bottom and pulled out a slip<br />\nof paper.<br />\nHis heart leaped with joy. He saw it all<br />\nnow. A great and prosperous friend had<br />\ntaken this means of gratifying his life-long<br />\nwish. Ah, a home in the country which<br />\nwould be surpassed by none. Then he slowly opened the paper and read.<br />\n\"This is to notify you that the price of<br />\noil has risen 10 cents a gallon. Cash only,<br />\nand pay in advance.<br />\nGraftily yours,<br />\nJOHN R., of R.\"<br />\n<br />\np<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nWith a groan, president Bremsen tore the<br />\nnote into a hundred bits. \"Oh,\" he cried,<br />\n\"that it should end this way. But I shall<br />\nnot yet despair about that home lin the<br />\ncountry, for, despite everything, perhaps<br />\n'Oils well that ends well 1'\"<br />\nWhich went to show that he was a philosopher in the truest sense of the word.<br />\nIt was the day after Christmas. Rean<br />\nDiffin was busily engaged in writing notes<br />\nthanking those who had sent him remembrances. Suddenly there was a knock on<br />\nthe door.<br />\n\"Come in,\" he said, and turned to see<br />\nwho was entering.<br />\n\"I got your note,\" said the white-haired<br />\nvisitor, \"and I am here.\"<br />\n\"Have you any excuse to offer for your<br />\nlate absence, for otherwise it would appear<br />\nthat your conduct has been quite reprehensible.\"<br />\n\"Not exactly,\" replied the visitor, \"except you see I was so rushed that<br />\n\"Absolutely no excuse at all.\"<br />\n)1<br />\n\"But you see<br />\n\"It is useless,\" said Rean Diffin, \"to prolong this unfortunate conversation. In fact<br />\nI cannot under any circumstances allow you<br />\nto come back until next Christmas. Perhaps<br />\nthen I shall give you another chance.\"<br />\nAnd then as Santa Claus turned to leave,<br />\nRean Diffin took down his empty stocking,<br />\ncarefully placing it away so that next year<br />\nhe would be able to hang it up with greater<br />\nexpectation of Xmas good things.<br />\nStacob H. Bollander was restlessly pacing<br />\nthe floor. Strewn all around him lay numerous books which now and again he would<br />\nkick viciously aside, quite regardless of the<br />\nfact that they appeared to be beautifully<br />\nbound.<br />\n\"Shades of Adam Smith,\" he cried, as<br />\nhe booted a first edition of Ricardo to the<br />\nfar end of the room; \"that it should come<br />\nto this.<br />\nAh, that my hopes should be<br />\nblighted, my ambition foiled, because of the<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ncarelessness of an integrating force. I shall<br />\nsee to it myself,\" he cried, hurling Malthus'<br />\nTheory of Population through the window,<br />\n\"that the railroad companies be moved back<br />\nto the manorial system and be held there,<br />\neven if I have to make my friend Arnate<br />\ndesert the Typographical Union so that he<br />\nmay assist me.\"<br />\n\"It's absolutely preposterous,\" he fumed,<br />\nas John Stuart Mills followed Malthus out<br />\ninto the snow, \"that I, the man behind the<br />\nPresidential chair, should be made the victim of an evil of distribution. Never,\" he<br />\nshouted, as Marshall''s Principles of Economics crashed through the candelabra.<br />\nThe door bell rang wildly. \"Ah,\" he<br />\ngasped, as he cleared the debris with a<br />\nbound, \"saved, saved by a second.\" As the<br />\nexpressman pushed a large basket, bearing<br />\nthe Presidential tag, into the hall, Stacob<br />\nH.

Handicapped in many ways, the<br />\nFreshmen played hard and well, and deserve<br />\ngreat credit for their \"never say die\" spirit.<br />\nBoth classes were on hand in full force,<br />\nand each tried to outdo the other in cheering. Honors were about even in this line,<br />\nand as both classes have had much experience cheering for the 'Varsity this season,<br />\nthere was enough noise to suit anyone. On<br />\nthe stands were over 1000 people and of this<br />\nnumber the large majority consisted of<br />\nfriends of the members of the two classes,<br />\nand this fact added interest to the game.<br />\nThe football contest came first on the program. Pease kicked off for the Freshmen,<br />\nand after six minutes of play the Juniors<br />\npushed Stewart over the line for a touchdown. Raleigh kicked goal. This was the<br />\nonly score in the first half.<br />\nIn the second half the Juniors played much<br />\nbetter and scored twelve more points. The<br />\nweight and experience of the Juniors told<br />\nin this half, and the Freshmen were quickly<br />\ntired out. On the Junior team Raleigh, Igle-<br />\n<br />\nhart, and Stewart excelled, while Chesney,<br />\nAbel and Street carried off the honors for<br />\nthe losers.

The general student body seems to<br />\nbe in favor of the movement, but there are<br />\na number of obstacles which must first be<br />\ncleared away before there can exist a reasonable certainty that the team will be recognized.<br />\nThe principal difficulty lies in the lack of<br />\nfunds. Last year, at the end of the football<br />\nseason, the management turned into the<br />\ntreasury of the Athletic Association a small<br />\nsum as a balance. This year, however, the<br />\nfootball accounts show a deficit of $75.00,<br />\nwhile there is also a deficit of $150.00 from<br />\nnon-rent of lockers, which would make our<br />\nexpense account at the end of the year be<br />\n$225.00 more than last year. As a matter<br />\nof fact, at the end of last year there was a<br />\nbalance of $125.00 in round numbers. Consequently, assuming that the lacrosse, baseball, and track teams will spend as much<br />\nmoney as last year, we may expect a deficit<br />\nat the end of this year amounting to about<br />\n$100.00.<br />\nIf basketball is recognized, the deficit<br />\ndoubtless will be larger. One of those most<br />\ninterested in the movement says that the<br />\nbasketball team need have only $75.00 as its<br />\nappropriation, this sum being considered by<br />\nhim sufficient to carry the team through the<br />\nentire season. Last year the baseball management said it would need only $100.00,<br />\nwhen, as a matter of fact, it consumed $325;<br />\nwherefore, there seems to be no certainty<br />\nthat the same state of affairs will not exist<br />\nat the end of the coming season, provided,<br />\nof course, that the team is recognized and<br />\nthat out-of-town trips are taken. The Athletic Board seems to be in favor of the sport<br />\nitself, but its decision is naturally dependent on whether there is enough money to<br />\ngive to the team and not hurt the other organizations at the same time.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nThe prospects for a good team are fairly<br />\nbright. McClure, of last year's five, is captain. Several of the old men are back, and<br />\nthere seem to be many promising new ones.<br />\nMagoffin, a member of this year's 'Varsity<br />\nfootball team, and an old, experienced<br />\nplayer, intends to come out for the team, as<br />\nwell as Estes, a \"med,\" formerly of Lehigh.<br />\nBasketball is .a good game to watch and<br />\na good game to play. The principal objection, as has been said, is the lack of money.<br />\nThe other teams under no conditions should<br />\nbe slighted, for they have already established themselves at the University. If the<br />\nfinances permit, then, basketball should be<br />\nrecognized; but without more money in sight<br />\nnothing can be done toward the recognition<br />\nof the sport.<br />\nTHE MODERN MAIDEN.<br />\nFather (very cold and disgruntled).\u2014<br />\nBrutal exhibition!<br />\nDaughter (enthusiastic) 0 papa, how can<br />\nyou say so I think it's perfectly lovely!<br />\nLook, they're carrying Fred off the field<br />\nAnd there's Jack with his face all over<br />\nblood!

FINDLAY FRENCH,<br />\nEditor-in-Chief of theN4ws-LETTER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nWhen the Lacrosse Team of 1902 had played its last game, the members of that<br />\norganization decided that each and every one of them would, if able to do so, either<br />\nreturn and coach the Johns Hopkins Lacrosse teams of the future or lend their assistance in some practical manner. Stich men as have been located in Baltimore and whose<br />\nvocation in life has allowed them to do so, have given the young men the benefit of<br />\ntheir experience, but others have been compelled to content themselves with rooting<br />\nfrom the side-lines or taking an occasional \"Here's to Hopkins\" when the news of<br />\nvictory has reached them by mail or telegram.<br />\nNow, knowing that the difficulty of getting out freshmen for the University Lacrosse team still prevails as it did during the time that we were at College, we are<br />\nprepared to make a start, although in but a small way, to give our assistance to the<br />\nteams which are to be developed, with the hope that other of the alumni may be moved<br />\nto do what in their hearts they are ready to do\u2014that is, give practical support to our<br />\nathletic teams.<br />\nWe herewith offer to the student body of the Johns Hopkins University twelve<br />\nloving cups\u2014these to be presented to the players of the team coming out victorious in<br />\na series of three lacrosse games to be played between the junior and freshman classes.<br />\nThe conditions to govern the contest are to be as follows:<br />\nI.<br />\nThe parties to the contest shall be twelve players picked from the junior class on<br />\nthe one side; and twelve players picked from the freshman and sub-freshman classes<br />\non the other.<br />\nAny dispute as to the eligibility of any student shall be settled by the Board of<br />\nGovernors of the Athletic Association.<br />\nIlL<br />\nThe games may be played on any field the contesting classes may select.<br />\nIV.<br />\nin<br />\nMarch<br />\nand up to the middle of April, and on such<br />\nplayed<br />\nto<br />\nbe<br />\ngames<br />\nare<br />\nThe<br />\nthe University lacrosse team.<br />\npracticeof<br />\nthe<br />\ndates as not to interfere with<br />\nV.<br />\nAll three games must be played.<br />\nVI.<br />\nIf it should so happen that two or more men would be called on to fill the same<br />\nposition in the same or different games throughout the series, it shall devolve on the<br />\nclass organization to select the player entitled to receive the prize.<br />\nWe suggest that the two classes appoint their respective captains at their earliest<br />\nopportunity, so that these men may see to it that their candidates report to practice<br />\nwith the 'Varsity Squad and thus raise the standard of the class teams.<br />\nShould any of the conditions set down above not seem feasible to the undergraduates, we will be glad to change them, so as to bring them in harmony with any<br />\nideas which may be suggested to us.<br />\nIn conclusion, we wish to add, that this, our offer for the Spring of 1906, is in the<br />\nnature of a trial. If it meets with the approval of the student body and arouses the<br />\nproper interest in the Freshman class, we hope to renew our offer from year to year.<br />\nTrusting that you will give this matter your attention in the columns of the<br />\nNEws-LETTER, we remain,<br />\nYours resp ectfully,<br />\nThe Lacrosse Team of 1902:<br />\nB.

We believe first of all that<br />\nthe plan proposed is an excellent one, and<br />\nthat it will meet the hearty approval of the<br />\nentire undergraduate body. Moreover, the<br />\noffer is not hampered by any condition which<br />\nwill in the least interfere with its success.<br />\nWe think that the presentation of individual<br />\nloving cups instead of the usual team trophy<br />\nwill prove an additional incentive toward<br />\nthe development of two excellent twelves.<br />\nThe undergraduate body of the Johns Hopkins should feel deeply grateful to the generosity of those men who have made such<br />\na splendid offer in the interest both of graduate and that of lacrosse. The best method<br />\nof showing this appreciation will be for the<br />\nJunior and Freshmen classes to take definite<br />\nand immediate action toward the formation<br />\nof such teams immediately after the Christmas vacation.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nThe annual meetings of the American Historical Association, the American Economic<br />\nAssociation, and the American Political<br />\nScience Association, will be held at this University between December 26th and 29th.<br />\nIt is needless to say that the conferences will<br />\nbe most interesting, and for the benefit of<br /><br />\nthose who desire to avail themselves of the<br />\nprivileges of the meetings, we publish the<br />\nprograms, almost in full. The addresses<br />\nwill be of much importance, and from the<br />\nbrilliant array of men who are to speak,<br />\neverything points to a successful conference.<br />\nThe public is cordially invited.<br />\nN the early part of the Autumn, the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER in an editorial advocated<br />\nthe establishment of a pay-station telephone booth in the basement of McCoy Hall<br />\nfor the convenience of students, but as yet<br />\nno definite steps have been taken to carry<br />\nout the idea. As we tried to emphasize before, the placing of a telephone in a place<br />\neasily accessible to all the students would be<br />\nof untold service not only to the students<br />\nthemselves but to the faculty. Many a lateness at lectures may be accounted for by the<br />\nfact that the tardy one was forced to go the<br />\ndistance of a block or more in order to send<br />\nan important message by telephone. The<br />\ntelephone companies, we believe, make no<br />\ncharges for the installation of a public telephone in a public place, and we are confident that the patronage of such a phone<br />\nwould amply justify our demand. We earnestly call the attention of the proper authorities to this request, which, we believe, is<br />\nmade in the interest of the entire student<br />\nbody.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nrecent editorial in the New York<br />\n\"Evening Press\" draws some interesting inferences from statistics in<br />\nregard to the amount and to the nature of<br />\nliterature read by college students. According to the \"Evening Press,\" most of the<br />\nreading indulged in by the average undergraduate consists in th eliterature of the day,<br />\nsuch as may be obtained from newsrpapers<br />\nand magazines. Athletics seem to be the<br />\nitem of first importance, but other branches<br />\nof current news are not neglected. What<br />\nappears to be slighted is the standard literature o fthe language. However, in direct<br />\ncontrast with these inferences, may be noted<br />\nthe establishment, at one of our Western<br />\nniversities, of a course on \"Current Events.\"<br />\nFrom conditions now prevailing at this<br />\nUniversity\u2014conditions inseparably connected with the plan of instruction\u2014we do not<br />\nbelieve that the undergraduates spend too<br />\nmuch time keeping themselves informed<br />\nwith the march of presetn events, and, if<br />\nanything, they err on the side of too great<br />\na neglect of the \"world to-day.\" Any required course on current events would be<br />\nmost unwise, but an elective one, treating<br />\nthe serious questions of the day, would not<br />\nonly be interesting, but would be genuinely<br />\nenlightening.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nREPENTENT.<br />\nNo joyous, gladsome song I sing,<br />\nWhen Xmas comes around,<br />\nIn fact I'm quite the saddest man,<br />\nThat ever could be found;<br />\nFor how can one be cheerful,<br />\nAnd how can one be gay,<br />\nWith several hundred presents,<br />\nWhich he must give away?<br />\nYou see there's Dol, and Polly,<br />\nAnd Grace, and Isabel,<br />\nAnd Elsie, Jean, and Molly,<br />\nAnd Nance, and pretty Nell.<br />\nAnd then, of course, there's Hetty,<br />\nAnd Eunice sweet, and Dot;<br />\nThat mustn't be forgot?<br />\nI've written verses to each one,<br />\nAnd sung their praises o'Cr,<br />\nI've called them by each charming name,<br />\nA thousand times or more;<br />\nBut now with Xmas coming,<br />\nI am repentant true,<br />\nFor with so many presents,<br />\nWhy, what's a man to do?<br />\nAnd then there's Flo, and Tessie,<br />\nLouise, and Phyllis dear,<br />\nAnd Janet, Edna, Bessie,<br />\nMust also count, I fear,<br />\nAnd then, oh pshaw, there's Mary,<br />\nAnd Marjie sweet, and Sue,<br />\nWho always were contrary,<br />\nWhene'er I tried to woo.<br /><br />\nHE Dance Committee has set the date<br />\nof the next dance for January 12.<br />\nThough the first dance was successful in almost every respect; still the committee does not intend to \"rest on its laurels,\" but expects to use every possible effort to make the next dance even more sucOld Santa Claus you say is good,<br />\ncessful than the last one.

In fact, it was<br />\nonly as he trudged home through the heavy<br />\nsnow that he realized that this was truly<br />\nChristmas eve, when everyone was supposedly happy and joyous. He remembered with<br />\nwhat eager expectancy he had looked forward to it when he was a boy, and a feeling<br />\nof sadness crept over him to think that those<br />\nhappy days of childhood were but a memory.<br />\nHe recalled with a keen pang of regret how<br />\nhe had always longed for a home in the<br />\ncountry\u2014how it had been the dream of a<br />\nlifetime\u2014and the thought that years before<br />\nsome kindly disposed friends, more blessed<br />\nwith this world's goods than he, had presented him with a lot, only seemed to make<br />\nhis sorrow more real. Truly it was the irony<br />\nof fate.<br />\nWith these recollections burning in his<br />\nbrain he entered his home, and totally ignoring his evening meal, went early to bed.<br />\nAfter a long while he managed to fall asleep,<br />\nbut the first light of dawn was sufficient to<br />\nawake him. With half an eye he was able<br />\nto distinguish a stocking hanging over his<br />\nmantelpiece.<br />\nHe was startled. What on earth could it<br />\nmean? . Quickly jumping out of bed, he<br />\nrushed toward the fireplace.<br />\nYes\u2014there<br />\nsure enough was a stocking, though as a<br />\nmatter of fact it hung very limply to its<br />\nfastening. Nevertheless he thrust his hand<br />\ndown to the bottom and pulled out a slip<br />\nof paper.<br />\nHis heart leaped with joy. He saw it all<br />\nnow. A great and prosperous friend had<br />\ntaken this means of gratifying his life-long<br />\nwish. Ah, a home in the country which<br />\nwould be surpassed by none. Then he slowly opened the paper and read.<br />\n\"This is to notify you that the price of<br />\noil has risen 10 cents a gallon. Cash only,<br />\nand pay in advance.<br />\nGraftily yours,<br />\nJOHN R., of R.\"<br /><br />\np<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nWith a groan, president Bremsen tore the<br />\nnote into a hundred bits. \"Oh,\" he cried,<br />\n\"that it should end this way. But I shall<br />\nnot yet despair about that home lin the<br />\ncountry, for, despite everything, perhaps<br />\n'Oils well that ends well 1'\"<br />\nWhich went to show that he was a philosopher in the truest sense of the word.<br />\nIt was the day after Christmas. Rean<br />\nDiffin was busily engaged in writing notes<br />\nthanking those who had sent him remembrances. Suddenly there was a knock on<br />\nthe door.<br />\n\"Come in,\" he said, and turned to see<br />\nwho was entering.<br />\n\"I got your note,\" said the white-haired<br />\nvisitor, \"and I am here.\"<br />\n\"Have you any excuse to offer for your<br />\nlate absence, for otherwise it would appear<br />\nthat your conduct has been quite reprehensible.\"<br />\n\"Not exactly,\" replied the visitor, \"except you see I was so rushed that<br />\n\"Absolutely no excuse at all.\"<br />\n)1<br />\n\"But you see<br />\n\"It is useless,\" said Rean Diffin, \"to prolong this unfortunate conversation. In fact<br />\nI cannot under any circumstances allow you<br />\nto come back until next Christmas. Perhaps<br />\nthen I shall give you another chance.\"<br />\nAnd then as Santa Claus turned to leave,<br />\nRean Diffin took down his empty stocking,<br />\ncarefully placing it away so that next year<br />\nhe would be able to hang it up with greater<br />\nexpectation of Xmas good things.<br />\nStacob H. Bollander was restlessly pacing<br />\nthe floor. Strewn all around him lay numerous books which now and again he would<br />\nkick viciously aside, quite regardless of the<br />\nfact that they appeared to be beautifully<br />\nbound.<br />\n\"Shades of Adam Smith,\" he cried, as<br />\nhe booted a first edition of Ricardo to the<br />\nfar end of the room; \"that it should come<br />\nto this.<br />\nAh, that my hopes should be<br />\nblighted, my ambition foiled, because of the<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncarelessness of an integrating force. I shall<br />\nsee to it myself,\" he cried, hurling Malthus'<br />\nTheory of Population through the window,<br />\n\"that the railroad companies be moved back<br />\nto the manorial system and be held there,<br />\neven if I have to make my friend Arnate<br />\ndesert the Typographical Union so that he<br />\nmay assist me.\"<br />\n\"It's absolutely preposterous,\" he fumed,<br />\nas John Stuart Mills followed Malthus out<br />\ninto the snow, \"that I, the man behind the<br />\nPresidential chair, should be made the victim of an evil of distribution. Never,\" he<br />\nshouted, as Marshall''s Principles of Economics crashed through the candelabra.<br />\nThe door bell rang wildly. \"Ah,\" he<br />\ngasped, as he cleared the debris with a<br />\nbound, \"saved, saved by a second.\" As the<br />\nexpressman pushed a large basket, bearing<br />\nthe Presidential tag, into the hall, Stacob<br />\nH. Bollander quickly flung back the top.<br />\n\"Safe, safe at last,\" he cried, an an inexpressable joyousness transformed his features. \"Ah, I am the happiest man in the<br />\nworld,\" he murmured, as he fervently<br />\nclasped a little San Domingan baby in his<br />\narms.<br /><br />\na publishing house first attracted his attention. \"Just as I had hoped,\" he said joy- _<br />\nfully, \"my masterpiece, a work which will<br />\ndoubtless have profound influence on Chaucerian criticism is complete.\" But tearing<br />\nopen the letter, what should meet his eye but<br />\nthe following: Dear Dr. Keene\u2014We regret<br />\nto announce that the manuscript of your<br />\ntreatise entitled, \"Did Chaucer use soap,<br />\nwith especial reference to the Wife of<br />\nBathe,\" has been plagarized by Pears' Annual for the current month, presenting a picture of the Wife of Bathe greeting Chaucer<br />\nwith \"Good morning, have you used Pears'<br />\nsoap?\"<br />\nFor an instant Dr. Keene tottered. But<br />\nquickly steadying himself on a copy of The<br />\nFaery Queen, he uttered a sigh of relief.<br />\n\"Not only,\" said he, \"as Shakespeare says,<br />\n'is imitation the sincerest flattery,' but the<br />\nfree advertisement this gives will make me<br />\nthe hero of the hour. And seating himself<br />\nat the table, he calmly immersed his shredded<br />\nwheat biscuit in a copy of Palgrave's \"Golden Treasury.\"<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nCarefully removing<br />\nDr. Keene awoke.<br />\nhis pillow, he<br />\nunder<br />\nHill's Rhetoric from<br />\nA flood<br />\nshutters.<br />\nthe<br />\narouse and threw open<br />\nrecalling<br />\nroom,<br />\nof sunshine poured into the<br />\nChaucer's remark, \"When sweete Aprille<br />\nwith his shoures soote,\" not that there was<br />\nany connection between the two, but at that<br />\nmoment he couldn't recall any quotation<br />\nfrom Hill which he thought would do as well.<br />\n\"At last,\" he murmured, \"Christmas is<br />\nhere, connoting joy and happiness and denoting a lot of useless presents, or, as Shakespeare would say, \"Heigho the holly\u2014this<br />\nlife is all folly.\" Then having dashed down<br />\na customary antidote for the dangers of<br />\nmixed metaphors, he dressed and went into<br />\nthe dining room.<br />\nThere were a number of be-ribboned packages surrounding his plate, but a note from<br /><br />\n\u2022 Professor Welch has been elected a member of the board of trustees of the Carnegie<br />\nInstitute, to fill the vacancy caused by the<br />\ndeath of the late John Hay.<br />\nThe third concert of the Musical Clubs was<br />\ngiven last Thursday night at Hannah More<br />\nAcademy.

Handicapped in many ways, the<br />\nFreshmen played hard and well, and deserve<br />\ngreat credit for their \"never say die\" spirit.<br />\nBoth classes were on hand in full force,<br />\nand each tried to outdo the other in cheering. Honors were about even in this line,<br />\nand as both classes have had much experience cheering for the 'Varsity this season,<br />\nthere was enough noise to suit anyone. On<br />\nthe stands were over 1000 people and of this<br />\nnumber the large majority consisted of<br />\nfriends of the members of the two classes,<br />\nand this fact added interest to the game.<br />\nThe football contest came first on the program. Pease kicked off for the Freshmen,<br />\nand after six minutes of play the Juniors<br />\npushed Stewart over the line for a touchdown. Raleigh kicked goal. This was the<br />\nonly score in the first half.<br />\nIn the second half the Juniors played much<br />\nbetter and scored twelve more points. The<br />\nweight and experience of the Juniors told<br />\nin this half, and the Freshmen were quickly<br />\ntired out. On the Junior team Raleigh, Igle-<br /><br />\nhart, and Stewart excelled, while Chesney,<br />\nAbel and Street carried off the honors for<br />\nthe losers.

The general student body seems to<br />\nbe in favor of the movement, but there are<br />\na number of obstacles which must first be<br />\ncleared away before there can exist a reasonable certainty that the team will be recognized.<br />\nThe principal difficulty lies in the lack of<br />\nfunds. Last year, at the end of the football<br />\nseason, the management turned into the<br />\ntreasury of the Athletic Association a small<br />\nsum as a balance. This year, however, the<br />\nfootball accounts show a deficit of $75.00,<br />\nwhile there is also a deficit of $150.00 from<br />\nnon-rent of lockers, which would make our<br />\nexpense account at the end of the year be<br />\n$225.00 more than last year. As a matter<br />\nof fact, at the end of last year there was a<br />\nbalance of $125.00 in round numbers. Consequently, assuming that the lacrosse, baseball, and track teams will spend as much<br />\nmoney as last year, we may expect a deficit<br />\nat the end of this year amounting to about<br />\n$100.00.<br />\nIf basketball is recognized, the deficit<br />\ndoubtless will be larger. One of those most<br />\ninterested in the movement says that the<br />\nbasketball team need have only $75.00 as its<br />\nappropriation, this sum being considered by<br />\nhim sufficient to carry the team through the<br />\nentire season. Last year the baseball management said it would need only $100.00,<br />\nwhen, as a matter of fact, it consumed $325;<br />\nwherefore, there seems to be no certainty<br />\nthat the same state of affairs will not exist<br />\nat the end of the coming season, provided,<br />\nof course, that the team is recognized and<br />\nthat out-of-town trips are taken. The Athletic Board seems to be in favor of the sport<br />\nitself, but its decision is naturally dependent on whether there is enough money to<br />\ngive to the team and not hurt the other organizations at the same time.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nThe prospects for a good team are fairly<br />\nbright. McClure, of last year's five, is captain. Several of the old men are back, and<br />\nthere seem to be many promising new ones.<br />\nMagoffin, a member of this year's 'Varsity<br />\nfootball team, and an old, experienced<br />\nplayer, intends to come out for the team, as<br />\nwell as Estes, a \"med,\" formerly of Lehigh.<br />\nBasketball is .a good game to watch and<br />\na good game to play. The principal objection, as has been said, is the lack of money.<br />\nThe other teams under no conditions should<br />\nbe slighted, for they have already established themselves at the University. If the<br />\nfinances permit, then, basketball should be<br />\nrecognized; but without more money in sight<br />\nnothing can be done toward the recognition<br />\nof the sport.<br />\nTHE MODERN MAIDEN.<br />\nFather (very cold and disgruntled).\u2014<br />\nBrutal exhibition!<br />\nDaughter (enthusiastic) 0 papa, how can<br />\nyou say so I think it's perfectly lovely!<br />\nLook, they're carrying Fred off the field<br />\nAnd there's Jack with his face all over<br />\nblood!
