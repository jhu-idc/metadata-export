It should not be<br />\nconthat serious thinkers who arrive at \"different\"<br />\nclusions must execute their thoughts in \"different\"<br />\nbehavior. Their direction is, in fact, taken from greater<br />\namong<br />\nawareness of the state of man than is common<br />\nfantastic,<br />\npeople who think the call for radical action<br />\nor unrealistic.<br />\nThose who believe in the \"call for peace in Vietnam\" have been fasting for two and three day periods<br />\nhave<br />\non campuses across the nation.

Such improvements,<br />\nhowever, cannot come from a library staff that is constantly either on guard against vandals or investigating<br />\nand repairing the damage of vandals.<br />\nThere can be little excuse for the stealing of doorknobs and elevator signals or for the breaking of fire<br />\ndoors. Nor can much be said for a mind that considers<br />\nthese objects \"trophies\" and the display of these trophies<br />\n\"the cool thing to do.\"<br />\nThe New Library is neither a playground for immature students nor a social center for lonely ones. It is<br />\na place to study and to learn. Its users should concentrate<br />\non how the library can better execute this function<br />\nrather than engage in acts that can only decrease the<br />\nlibrary's effectiveness as a tool of scholarship.<br />\nImplicit in any effort to improve the library's<br />\neffectiveness is the naming of problems and the suggestion of solutions. Two problems are immediately<br />\napparent.<br />\nFirst, the south lounges on A, B, C, and D levels<br />\nare designed as study areas, but lengthy, concentrated<br />\nstudy is impossible in these areas because of the poor<br />\nlighting.

But<br />\nin spite of Time Magazine, after<br />\nthe loss of thousands of lives,<br />\nthe French were forced to leave<br />\nin May, 1954. Now the United<br />\nStates, billions of dollars and<br />\nthousands of lives later, is in<br />\nViet Nam and is losing. As far<br />\nback as April, Walter Lippman<br />\nwrote, \"The truth, which is being obscured for the American<br />\npeople, is that the Saigon government has the allegiance of<br />\nno more than thirty per cent of<br />\nthe people and controls (even<br />\nin daylight) not much more than<br />\na quarter of the territory.\" Why<br />\nare we losing and why, then, are<br />\nwe there?<br />\nIn a column in last week's New<br />\nYork Times, James Reston wrote<br />\nthat the administration has<br />\nvarious, often contradicgiv\u2022<br />\ntory, reasons why the United<br />\nStates is fighting in Viet, Nam.<br />\nOne justification is, to no one's<br />\nsurprise, \"in defense of Democracy.\" During the Kennedy administration, Dean Rusk told us<br />\nthat Diem's regime was an \"outpost of the free world.\" Now we<br />\nlearn (Life, November 27, 1964)<br />\nthat Diem was a tyrant. The<br />\nfact is that, as Dr. Bernard Fall,<br />\na historian of Indo-China, points<br />\nout, no elections have ever been<br />\nheld in Viet Nam due to United<br />\nStates intervention .to block the<br />\nfree elections that had been<br />\npledged at Geneva and which<br />\nwere to be held in North and<br />\nSouth Viet Nam in 1956 to unify<br />\n<br />\nall of Viet Nam.

The fact is that military<br />\nsupport from the north has been<br />\nminimal. The New York Times<br />\nreports that seventy-five per<br />\ncent of the Viet Cong weapons<br />\nare American made and captured<br />\nfrom the forces of Saigon, and<br />\nmost of the rest are manufactured in primitive \"jungle factories.\" Never has the government been able to document its<br />\ncharge that the threat to South<br />\nViet Nam is external. As Senator<br />\nMoore has pointed out, the only<br />\nsizable troops in South Viet Nam<br />\nare American. The fact is that<br />\nthe war is fundamentally a civil<br />\nwar. The government repeatedly<br />\nlaments the impossibility of d 2tecting the difference between<br />\nthe Viet Cong and the Viet<br />\nNamese people. Again and again,<br />\nthe government military attacks<br />\nfail because the people tip off<br />\nthe guerillas.

His larger bronze<br />\ncomposition of Gears is effective,<br />\nand creates a subtle harmony of<br />\ncolors through the corroded<br />\ngreen tone of the bronze against<br />\nthe earth-brown of the wooden<br />\npanel on which it is mounted.<br />\nAs has been indicated, some<br />\nof the works show artistic ability, while others do not. But<br />\nwhat all of these works have in<br />\ncommon is that they were produced on a campus which does<br />\nnot have a studio program in<br />\nart. Each of these works was<br />\nproduced, not in fulfilment of<br />\nan academic requirement, but<br />\nfor the pure love of art. The<br />\nactual artistic quality of the exhibit is of secondary importance. What is important is the<br />\nidea behind it. This represents<br />\na beginning, and will, hopefully,<br />\nact as a primum mobile in stimulating enthusiasm for the fine<br />\narts at Hopkins.<br />\nThe fact that this collection<br />\n<br />\nwas so quickly gathered, and<br />\nthat the response was so great,<br />\nseems to indicate a need on<br />\nthis campus for some form of<br />\ninstruction in painting and<br />\ndrawing. At this moment several<br />\nstudents in the Fine Arts Department are preparing to establish a small, off-campus, lifestudy group.<br />\nThe problem, of course, is that<br />\nthe practice of art is difficult to<br />\nequate with the old world tradition of scholarship. Admittedly, painting and sculpture fall<br />\noutside of the realm of academia.<br />\nBut to have an educational program entirely devoid of studio<br />\nart is to deny a need basic to<br />\nour age and culture, as is proven<br />\nby the very existence of the<br />\nStudent Art Exhibit. If we are<br />\nto remain a leader among universities, we must defer to the<br />\npressing fact that the welleducated man is not without a<br />\nmeans of creative expression.<br />\n<br />\n'20th Cent.'

It should not be<br />\nconthat serious thinkers who arrive at \"different\"<br />\nclusions must execute their thoughts in \"different\"<br />\nbehavior. Their direction is, in fact, taken from greater<br />\namong<br />\nawareness of the state of man than is common<br />\nfantastic,<br />\npeople who think the call for radical action<br />\nor unrealistic.<br />\nThose who believe in the \"call for peace in Vietnam\" have been fasting for two and three day periods<br />\nhave<br />\non campuses across the nation.

It<br />\nis important to note, however, that the call for peace<br />\nis addressed to all who hear.<br /><br />\nProblems in the Library<br />\nIt is about time that people on this campus realize<br />\nthat sandalisin is a sign of a demented mind and not<br />\nan indication of great ingenuity.<br />\nAs any careful reader of the News-Letter can attest,<br />\nthere are already enough complaints about the New<br />\nLibrary to suggest that perhaps both its operation and<br />\nfacilities could be greatly improved. Such improvements,<br />\nhowever, cannot come from a library staff that is constantly either on guard against vandals or investigating<br />\nand repairing the damage of vandals.<br />\nThere can be little excuse for the stealing of doorknobs and elevator signals or for the breaking of fire<br />\ndoors. Nor can much be said for a mind that considers<br />\nthese objects \"trophies\" and the display of these trophies<br />\n\"the cool thing to do.\"<br />\nThe New Library is neither a playground for immature students nor a social center for lonely ones. It is<br />\na place to study and to learn. Its users should concentrate<br />\non how the library can better execute this function<br />\nrather than engage in acts that can only decrease the<br />\nlibrary's effectiveness as a tool of scholarship.<br />\nImplicit in any effort to improve the library's<br />\neffectiveness is the naming of problems and the suggestion of solutions. Two problems are immediately<br />\napparent.<br />\nFirst, the south lounges on A, B, C, and D levels<br />\nare designed as study areas, but lengthy, concentrated<br />\nstudy is impossible in these areas because of the poor<br />\nlighting.

As far<br />\nback as April, Walter Lippman<br />\nwrote, \"The truth, which is being obscured for the American<br />\npeople, is that the Saigon government has the allegiance of<br />\nno more than thirty per cent of<br />\nthe people and controls (even<br />\nin daylight) not much more than<br />\na quarter of the territory.\" Why<br />\nare we losing and why, then, are<br />\nwe there?<br />\nIn a column in last week's New<br />\nYork Times, James Reston wrote<br />\nthat the administration has<br />\nvarious, often contradicgiv\u2022<br />\ntory, reasons why the United<br />\nStates is fighting in Viet, Nam.<br />\nOne justification is, to no one's<br />\nsurprise, \"in defense of Democracy.\" During the Kennedy administration, Dean Rusk told us<br />\nthat Diem's regime was an \"outpost of the free world.\" Now we<br />\nlearn (Life, November 27, 1964)<br />\nthat Diem was a tyrant. The<br />\nfact is that, as Dr. Bernard Fall,<br />\na historian of Indo-China, points<br />\nout, no elections have ever been<br />\nheld in Viet Nam due to United<br />\nStates intervention .to block the<br />\nfree elections that had been<br />\npledged at Geneva and which<br />\nwere to be held in North and<br />\nSouth Viet Nam in 1956 to unify<br /><br />\nall of Viet Nam. The U. S. reald that Ho Chi Minh, as ft\u2014net.<br />\npresider: --lisenhower writes in<br />\nhis Mandate For Change, was<br />\na national hero for his ,'i-tory<br />\nover the French and would win<br />\nupwards of \"eighty per cent of<br />\nthe population\" in any free election.<br />\nCivil War<br />\nThe second general reason for<br />\nAmerican intervention in Viet<br />\nNam is that South Viet Nam is<br />\nthreatened by a Viet Cong militarily supplied by North Viet<br />\nNam. The fact is that military<br />\nsupport from the north has been<br />\nminimal. The New York Times<br />\nreports that seventy-five per<br />\ncent of the Viet Cong weapons<br />\nare American made and captured<br />\nfrom the forces of Saigon, and<br />\nmost of the rest are manufactured in primitive \"jungle factories.\" Never has the government been able to document its<br />\ncharge that the threat to South<br />\nViet Nam is external. As Senator<br />\nMoore has pointed out, the only<br />\nsizable troops in South Viet Nam<br />\nare American. The fact is that<br />\nthe war is fundamentally a civil<br />\nwar. The government repeatedly<br />\nlaments the impossibility of d 2tecting the difference between<br />\nthe Viet Cong and the Viet<br />\nNamese people. Again and again,<br />\nthe government military attacks<br />\nfail because the people tip off<br />\nthe guerillas. After having lost<br />\nover 79,000 lives and denied the<br />\nright of free election by the<br />\nUnited States and a succession<br />\nof<br />\nunpopular<br />\ndictatorships,<br />\nthousands of troops are continuing to defect \u2014 the traditional<br /><br />\nsignal of a lo6ing counter-guerilla war.<br />\nWe have been told repea.tedly<br />\nthat if the U.S. gets out of. Viet<br />\nNam, the Viet Cong will win.<br />\nThat statement is a little naive,<br />\nsince the Viet Cong has already<br />\nwon everything except the cities,<br />\nand the real question is not<br />\nwhether the Viet Cong will win,<br />\nbut why they have won. The<br />\nSaigon government will collapse<br />\nthe minute we leave. But why?<br />\nHow has a part time army with<br />\nless than 100,000 men, with no<br />\nnavy, no air force, no artillery,<br />\nno tanks, living on rice provided<br />\nby the peasants, been able to win<br />\nmost of the territory of South<br />\nViet Nam against a well-fed, wellequipped armed force of over<br />\n600,000 with a navy, an air force,<br />\n20,000 American military advisors, and several billion 4ollars<br />\nof Ainei xi aid?<br />\nSuppression<br />\nFrom the above examination<br />\nof the war h is clear that the<br />\n(Continued on Page 7)<br /><br />\nA Favorite Rendez Wu<br />\nfor Hopkins Men<br /><br />\nJIMMY WU'S<br />\nNEW<br />\nCHINA INN<br />\nCharles Street below 25th<br />\nJIMMY WU'S<br />\nCARRY OUT SHOP<br />\n1411 E.

His larger bronze<br />\ncomposition of Gears is effective,<br />\nand creates a subtle harmony of<br />\ncolors through the corroded<br />\ngreen tone of the bronze against<br />\nthe earth-brown of the wooden<br />\npanel on which it is mounted.<br />\nAs has been indicated, some<br />\nof the works show artistic ability, while others do not. But<br />\nwhat all of these works have in<br />\ncommon is that they were produced on a campus which does<br />\nnot have a studio program in<br />\nart. Each of these works was<br />\nproduced, not in fulfilment of<br />\nan academic requirement, but<br />\nfor the pure love of art. The<br />\nactual artistic quality of the exhibit is of secondary importance. What is important is the<br />\nidea behind it. This represents<br />\na beginning, and will, hopefully,<br />\nact as a primum mobile in stimulating enthusiasm for the fine<br />\narts at Hopkins.<br />\nThe fact that this collection<br /><br />\nwas so quickly gathered, and<br />\nthat the response was so great,<br />\nseems to indicate a need on<br />\nthis campus for some form of<br />\ninstruction in painting and<br />\ndrawing. At this moment several<br />\nstudents in the Fine Arts Department are preparing to establish a small, off-campus, lifestudy group.<br />\nThe problem, of course, is that<br />\nthe practice of art is difficult to<br />\nequate with the old world tradition of scholarship. Admittedly, painting and sculpture fall<br />\noutside of the realm of academia.<br />\nBut to have an educational program entirely devoid of studio<br />\nart is to deny a need basic to<br />\nour age and culture, as is proven<br />\nby the very existence of the<br />\nStudent Art Exhibit. If we are<br />\nto remain a leader among universities, we must defer to the<br />\npressing fact that the welleducated man is not without a<br />\nmeans of creative expression.<br /><br />\n'20th Cent.'
