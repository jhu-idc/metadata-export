The views<br />\nare not necessarily those of all Board of<br />\n<br />\nsessions of The Johns Hopkins Unicollege holiday periods, by underexpressed in the editorial columns<br />\nControl members.<br />\n<br />\nEditors-in-Chief<br />\nRichard Lidz<br />\nFrank Musial<br />\n<br />\nPlease Clip And Save ...<br />\nToday, before our current and still new publishing year<br />\nprogresses any further, we state here some guiding NewsLetter principles for the illumination and future reference of<br />\nour readers;<br />\nThe first function of the News-Letter, like that of any<br />\nreputable newspiaper, is to inform, and like any newspaper,<br />\nwe are supported by a community to perform this service.<br />\nThe community the News-Letter serves, the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body, like every community supporting a newspaper,<br />\nputs the paper it supports under the obligation to print all<br />\nof the community's news, whether good or bad, and without<br />\nfavoritism to any organization or individual.<br />\nTherefore, we hasten to remind certain individuals and<br />\ncertain organizations that the advertisement of campus social<br />\nand athletic events is not our sole \"raison d'etre\"; that<br />\nomission is one way of telling an untruth; that suppression<br />\ngives rise to rumors, often proving to be far more damaging<br />\nthan would have been the publication of the facts; that the<br />\nknowledge that \"unfavorable publicity to the Hopkins\" results<br />\nfrom the conscientious reportage by the News-Letter of the<br />\nfacts of an unsavory situation is an effective deterrent to any<br />\nrash actions willfully contemplated by an individual or organization, or perhaps resulting from insufficient forethought\u2014<br />\nat any rate, we hope it helps to instill on campus a \"think twice\"<br />\nattitude.<br />\nThe last statement above hints at a secondary duty that<br />\naccompanies a newspaper's primary function, i.e., to inform.<br />\nThis secondary duty is to mold public opinion.<br />\nWe try to mold campus opinion in two ways. The first is,<br />\nas already mentioned, by presenting a complete and objective<br />\nreportage of the news. By objectively rePorting the complete<br />\nfacts we help the community we serve form its own judgments<br />\nas to the right or wrong of a situation.<br />\nThe second way we mold campus opinion is, of course,<br />\nthrough these editorial columns and featur,e pages. In analyzing, interpreting and commenting here upon the week's news<br />\nwe strive for a position closely akin to our ideal of complete<br />\nobjectivity in news reports, that of being observers completely<br />\nindependent of any and all external pressures.<br />\nHowever, we realize that we can be wrong in our observations. Hence we have a standing invitation to our readers<br />\nto point out our errors, to offer constructive criticism, suggestions, refutations and rebuttals, whether by a meeting with<br />\nthe News-Letter Board of Control, or through our correspondence columns, if ,circumstances warrant it, we even will be<br />\nmore than happy to print here signed \"guest editorials.\"<br />\nFinally, nut-shelling our policy and at the same time offering, if we may, still an added ramification (a ramification<br />\nsomewhat slightly and sadly lacking here today) we would<br />\nlike to quote a statement of the late William Allen White<br />\n\u2014a statement of which we as collegiate journalists are rather<br />\nfond \u2022<br />\n<br />\nViews, Stands Of Gubernatorial<br />\nAspirants Contrasted, Compared<br />\nDue to the imminence of the Nov. 2 elections the News-Letter prints this week the first of a<br />\nseries of articles intended to better acquaint the Hopkins student with the candidates running for<br />\nthe more important offices in the vicinity.<br />\nMcKELDIN<br />\nIn the coming gubernatorial<br />\nelection, the people of Maryland<br />\nwill be faced with the choice between a pair of well known state<br />\nfigures; one of these two is the<br />\npresent incumbent, the Honorable<br />\nTheodore Roosevelt McKeldin.<br />\nGovernor McKeldin, now running for his second term, was<br />\nborn in Baltimore City in 1900,<br />\nand included in his scholastic background is the Johns Hopkins University, where he studied economics. In addition to his being<br />\nGovernor, he has also been Mayor<br />\nof the city of Baltimore.<br />\nIn the eyes of the supporters<br />\nof Governor McKeldin, his years<br />\nof office holding have been characterized by a complete, meth-<br />\n<br />\nment departments, 'and stress<br />\nthat he has for the first time in<br />\nthe history of the state brought<br />\ninto existence an itemized budget\u2014containing no hidden funds<br />\n\u2014and which clearly shows the<br />\nuse of every dollar instead of the<br />\nusual lump sums for only vaguely<br />\ndefined areas.<br />\nBesides being of. local prominence Governor McKeldin is active<br />\non the national scale in that it<br />\nwas he who made the nominating<br />\nspeech of Pres. Eisenhower at the<br />\nRepublican Convention; also he<br />\nhas been awarded several prizes<br />\nmerely in the capacity of a private citizen for his outstanding<br />\nwork in the field of religion and<br />\nbrotherhood.<br />\n<br />\ndeveloped<br />\nplatform<br />\ncomprising<br />\nover a dozen pertinent issues. The<br />\nfirst of these is a plan to gala<br />\npublicity for Maryland products<br />\nand to make known the state's<br />\nindustrial position in the nation.<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\nAtie<br />\n<br />\nFollowing this hand in hand are<br />\nhis hopes to form a commission<br />\nto promote the use of Maryland<br />\nresources in addition to making<br />\navailable those that are yet virtually untapped. In line with advancing industry in small communities desirous of such, Dr.<br />\nByrd proposes state-given aid for<br />\nthe initial impetus. He also feels<br />\nthat the St. Lawrence seaway is<br />\na definite threat to the livelihood<br />\nof not just the city of Baltimore,<br />\nbut also to thestate of Maryland,<br />\n<br />\nAs the Governor stated at his<br />\ninaugural address in January,<br />\n1951, \"I take up this trust...in<br />\nhumility and with a profound<br />\nsense of dedication.\" His followers will report that he has. cartied out this promise and know<br />\nthat he will do so again if reelected,<br />\n<br />\n(by.

The DSRC, contrary to the apparent wish of their<br />\nconstituents, instituted the regulation, in a manner which seems<br />\nparallel to the benevolent dictatorships, where laws are pa.ssed<br />\nfor the good of the people even if without their consent. But<br />\nthe action was taken with no attempt on the part of the DSRC<br />\nto point out to dorm residents its merits. It was, rather, assumed<br />\nthat no intelligent discussion could come of an open hearing.<br />\nThe bill was railroaded through without giving the students a<br />\nchance to air their views.

The views<br />\nare not necessarily those of all Board of<br /><br />\nsessions of The Johns Hopkins Unicollege holiday periods, by underexpressed in the editorial columns<br />\nControl members.<br /><br />\nEditors-in-Chief<br />\nRichard Lidz<br />\nFrank Musial<br /><br />\nPlease Clip And Save ...<br />\nToday, before our current and still new publishing year<br />\nprogresses any further, we state here some guiding NewsLetter principles for the illumination and future reference of<br />\nour readers;<br />\nThe first function of the News-Letter, like that of any<br />\nreputable newspiaper, is to inform, and like any newspaper,<br />\nwe are supported by a community to perform this service.<br />\nThe community the News-Letter serves, the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body, like every community supporting a newspaper,<br />\nputs the paper it supports under the obligation to print all<br />\nof the community's news, whether good or bad, and without<br />\nfavoritism to any organization or individual.<br />\nTherefore, we hasten to remind certain individuals and<br />\ncertain organizations that the advertisement of campus social<br />\nand athletic events is not our sole \"raison d'etre\"; that<br />\nomission is one way of telling an untruth; that suppression<br />\ngives rise to rumors, often proving to be far more damaging<br />\nthan would have been the publication of the facts; that the<br />\nknowledge that \"unfavorable publicity to the Hopkins\" results<br />\nfrom the conscientious reportage by the News-Letter of the<br />\nfacts of an unsavory situation is an effective deterrent to any<br />\nrash actions willfully contemplated by an individual or organization, or perhaps resulting from insufficient forethought\u2014<br />\nat any rate, we hope it helps to instill on campus a \"think twice\"<br />\nattitude.<br />\nThe last statement above hints at a secondary duty that<br />\naccompanies a newspaper's primary function, i.e., to inform.<br />\nThis secondary duty is to mold public opinion.<br />\nWe try to mold campus opinion in two ways. The first is,<br />\nas already mentioned, by presenting a complete and objective<br />\nreportage of the news.
