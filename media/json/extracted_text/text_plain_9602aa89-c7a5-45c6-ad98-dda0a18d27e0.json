March 21: Lord Acton<br />\n<br />\nand Scientific History<br />\nThe James Schouler Lectureship in History and Political<br />\nScience was established in 1908<br />\nby James Schouler, professor of<br />\nlaw at Boston University and an<br />\nannual lecturer at Johns Hopkins for seventeen years.<br />\nWrites Prolifically<br />\nProfessor Butterfield is the<br />\nauthor of numerous books and<br />\narticles on History and Historiography, among them Origins<br />\nof Modern Science, Christianity<br />\nand History, and International<br />\nConflict in the Twentieth<br />\nCentury.<br />\n<br />\nwith<br />\nCampus<br />\nMax<br />\nghanan<br />\nOn<br />\n(Author of\"I Was a Teen-age Dwarf', \"The Many<br />\nLoves of Dobie Gillis\", etc.)<br />\n<br />\nHAIL TO THE DEAN!<br />\nToday let us examine that much maligned, widely misunderstood, grossly overworked, wholly dedicated campus figure\u2014<br />\nthe dean.<br />\nThe dean (from the Latin Deanere\u2014to expel) is not, as many<br />\nthink, primarily a disciplinary officer. He is a counselor and<br />\nguide, a haven and refuge for the troubled student. The dean<br />\n(from the Greek Deanos\u2014to skewer) is characterized chiefly by<br />\nsympathy, wisdom, patience, forbearance, and a fondness for<br />\nhomely pleasures like community singing, farina, spelldowns,<br />\nand Marlboro Cigarettes. The dean (from the German Deangemacht \u2014to poop a party) is fond of Marlboros for the same<br />\nreason that all men of good will are fond of Marlboros\u2014because<br />\nMarlboro is an honest cigarette. Those good Marlboro tobaccos<br />\nare honestly good, honestly aged to the peak of perfection, honestly blended for the best of all possible flavors. Marlboro<br />\nhonestly comes in two different containers\u2014a soft pack which<br />\nis honestly soft and a Flip-Top box which honestly flips. You<br />\ntoo will flip when next you try an honest Marlboro, which, one<br />\nhonestly hopes, will be soon.<br />\n<br />\nhere 16' liotdctryereiii yediz<br />\nBut I digress. We were learning how a dean helps poor,<br />\ntroubled undergraduates. To illustrate, let us take a typical<br />\ncase from the files of Dean S<br />\nof the University of Y. . .<br />\n(Oh, why be so mysterious? The dean's name is Sigafoos and<br />\nthe University is Yutah.)<br />\nWise, kindly Dean Sigafoos was visited one day by a freshman named Walter Aguincourt who came to ask permission to<br />\nmarry one Emma Blenheim, his dormitory laundress. To the<br />\ndean the marriage seemed ill-advised, for Walter was only 18<br />\nyears old and Emma was 91. Walter agreed with the dean, but<br />\nsaid he felt obligated to go through with it because Emma had<br />\ninvested her life savings in a transparent rainhood to protect<br />\nher from the mist at Niagara Falls, where they planned to spend<br />\ntheir honeymoon. If Walter called off the wedding, what use<br />\nwould the poor woman possibly have for a rainhood in Yutala<br />\nThe wise, kindly dean pondered briefly and came up with a<br />\nbrilliant answer: let Walter punch holes in the back of Emma's<br />\nsteam iron. With steam billowing back at the old lady, she<br />\nwould find a rainhood very useful\u2014possibly even essential.<br />\nWhimpering with gratitude, Walter kissed the dean's Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa key and hastened away to follow his advice\u2014and<br />\nthe results, I am pleased to report, were madly successful!<br />\nToday Emma is a happy woman\u2014singing lustily, wearing<br />\nher rainhood, eating soft-center chocolates, and ironing clothes<br />\n\u2014twice as happy, to be candid, than if she had married Walter<br />\n. And what of Walter? He is happy too. Freed from his unwanted liaison with Emma, he married a girl much nearer his<br />\nown age\u2014Agnes Yucca, 72. Walter ,is now the proud father\u2014<br />\nstepfather, to be perfectly accurate\u2014of three fine, healthy<br />\nboys from Agnes's first marriage\u2014Everett, 38; Wilhelm, 43;<br />\nand Irving, 55\u2014and when Walter puts the boys on a lead and<br />\ntakes them for a stroll in the park on Sunday afternoon, you<br />\nmay be sure there is not a dry eye in Yutah.<br />\nAnd Dean Sigafoos? He too is happy\u2014happy to spend long,<br />\ntiring hours in his little office, giving counsel without stint and<br />\nwithout complaint, doing his bit to set the young, uncertain<br />\nfeet of his charges on the path to a brighter tomorrow.<br />\n1963 Max Shulman<br />\n<br />\nWe don t say Marlboro is the dean of filter cigarettes, but<br />\nwe're sure it's at the head of the class.

Wilson Shaffer<br /><br />\nA Broader Study Abroad<br />\nThe new procedure established for students desiring<br />\nto study abroad during the Junior year is a welcomed<br />\naddition in the educational policy of the University toward the undergraduate schools. The plan eliminates the<br />\nchaotic lack of procedure which has existed for the accreditation of courses taken abroad.

He is a counselor and<br />\nguide, a haven and refuge for the troubled student. The dean<br />\n(from the Greek Deanos\u2014to skewer) is characterized chiefly by<br />\nsympathy, wisdom, patience, forbearance, and a fondness for<br />\nhomely pleasures like community singing, farina, spelldowns,<br />\nand Marlboro Cigarettes. The dean (from the German Deangemacht \u2014to poop a party) is fond of Marlboros for the same<br />\nreason that all men of good will are fond of Marlboros\u2014because<br />\nMarlboro is an honest cigarette. Those good Marlboro tobaccos<br />\nare honestly good, honestly aged to the peak of perfection, honestly blended for the best of all possible flavors. Marlboro<br />\nhonestly comes in two different containers\u2014a soft pack which<br />\nis honestly soft and a Flip-Top box which honestly flips. You<br />\ntoo will flip when next you try an honest Marlboro, which, one<br />\nhonestly hopes, will be soon.<br /><br />\nhere 16' liotdctryereiii yediz<br />\nBut I digress. We were learning how a dean helps poor,<br />\ntroubled undergraduates. To illustrate, let us take a typical<br />\ncase from the files of Dean S<br />\nof the University of Y. . .<br />\n(Oh, why be so mysterious? The dean's name is Sigafoos and<br />\nthe University is Yutah.)<br />\nWise, kindly Dean Sigafoos was visited one day by a freshman named Walter Aguincourt who came to ask permission to<br />\nmarry one Emma Blenheim, his dormitory laundress. To the<br />\ndean the marriage seemed ill-advised, for Walter was only 18<br />\nyears old and Emma was 91. Walter agreed with the dean, but<br />\nsaid he felt obligated to go through with it because Emma had<br />\ninvested her life savings in a transparent rainhood to protect<br />\nher from the mist at Niagara Falls, where they planned to spend<br />\ntheir honeymoon. If Walter called off the wedding, what use<br />\nwould the poor woman possibly have for a rainhood in Yutala<br />\nThe wise, kindly dean pondered briefly and came up with a<br />\nbrilliant answer: let Walter punch holes in the back of Emma's<br />\nsteam iron. With steam billowing back at the old lady, she<br />\nwould find a rainhood very useful\u2014possibly even essential.<br />\nWhimpering with gratitude, Walter kissed the dean's Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa key and hastened away to follow his advice\u2014and<br />\nthe results, I am pleased to report, were madly successful!<br />\nToday Emma is a happy woman\u2014singing lustily, wearing<br />\nher rainhood, eating soft-center chocolates, and ironing clothes<br />\n\u2014twice as happy, to be candid, than if she had married Walter<br />\n. And what of Walter? He is happy too. Freed from his unwanted liaison with Emma, he married a girl much nearer his<br />\nown age\u2014Agnes Yucca, 72. Walter ,is now the proud father\u2014<br />\nstepfather, to be perfectly accurate\u2014of three fine, healthy<br />\nboys from Agnes's first marriage\u2014Everett, 38; Wilhelm, 43;<br />\nand Irving, 55\u2014and when Walter puts the boys on a lead and<br />\ntakes them for a stroll in the park on Sunday afternoon, you<br />\nmay be sure there is not a dry eye in Yutah.<br />\nAnd Dean Sigafoos? He too is happy\u2014happy to spend long,<br />\ntiring hours in his little office, giving counsel without stint and<br />\nwithout complaint, doing his bit to set the young, uncertain<br />\nfeet of his charges on the path to a brighter tomorrow.<br />\n1963 Max Shulman<br /><br />\nWe don t say Marlboro is the dean of filter cigarettes, but<br />\nwe're sure it's at the head of the class.
