BANKS,'29<br />\n<br />\nWhen the \"New Plan\" was announced as the definite policy<br />\nof this University, one of the revolutionary features of the<br />\nplan was the abandonment, in the near future, of the first two<br />\nyears of collegiate instruction and the abolishment of the<br />\nCollege of Arts and Sciences. The student body would be<br />\ncomposed of only those students who sought a higher degree<br />\nthan the Bachelor of Arts.<br />\nFor various reasons, since the first enunciation of the plan,<br />\nthe apparently fairly imminent abolition of the College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences has been placed in the category of an \"ultimate<br />\nend.\" And more recently it has become more and more apparent that this part of the plan cannot become a reality for years<br />\nto come. Hopkins needs the undergraduate department. It is<br />\nhardly heresy to say, particularly, that the University needs<br />\nthe income derived from the undergraduates' tuition fees.<br />\nThis is an undisputed fact. Of course, it is conceivable that<br />\nsome wealthy man or institution such as the General Educational Board might suddenly present the University with a<br />\nfew million dollars, but we shall let you draw your own conclusions as to the probability of this..<br />\nFor the past year the University has centered its attention<br />\nupon the New Plan. The undergraduate department has received little notice and considerable neglect. The list of courses<br />\nhas been drastically cut, and many students are being subjected to high school pedagogical methods at the hands of<br />\nearnest and well-meaning, but green, student assistants.<br />\nThe unfortunate situation that now exists was almost inevitable, however. The past year has been one of transition and<br />\nexperiment, one in which the undergraduate department was<br />\nbound to suffer. The censure that has been passed upon the<br />\nadministration by many of the students should, more rightfully, have been cast upon the existing circumstances.<br />\nMany members of the faculty realize that the College of<br />\nArts and Sciences canot be abolished for some time to come.<br />\nThey realize, moreover, that if this is the case, the undergraduates are deserving of more consideration than the catalogue accords them at present. Before the end of the year, we<br />\nhave good reason to believe, several changes will take place<br />\nthat will grant to the students in the College a wider range of<br />\ncourses and a more satisfactory working basis generally. In<br />\nplace of the two or three courses now being offered in any one<br />\ndepartment, it is quite probable that a system will be inaugurated wherein five or six courses will be given, although in<br />\nalternate years. Such a plan would allow the departments<br />\nto keep within their budgets, but at the same time would<br />\nallow students to take more than two courses in any subject.<br />\nIt is undoubtedly an improvement over the present scheme of<br />\nstarvation.<br />\nUnless we are very much mistaken, the College next year<br />\nshould be a much more satisfactory place to attend than it has<br />\nbeen so far this year. We do not strike this note of optimism<br />\nwith any misgivings: We believe that the administration<br />\nrealizes that certain conditions are unsatisfactory, and will<br />\ntake steps, shortly, to remedy them.<br />\n<br />\nthis als<br />\nIf it zv(<br />\n<br />\nENERAL ELECTRIC<br />\n<br />\nGENERAL<br />\n<br />\nELECTRIC<br />\n<br />\nCOMPANY.<br />\n<br />\nSCHENECTADY.<br />\n<br />\nNEW<br />\n<br />\nYORK<br />\n<br />\nlege<br />\nNea<br />\n<br />\nsin<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, JANUARY 6, 1928<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS<br />\n<br />\nAn interfraternity war is appar- crease of responsibility will gradently in the process of conception ually overcome the excessive abat Ohio State University.

BANKS,'29<br /><br />\nWhen the \"New Plan\" was announced as the definite policy<br />\nof this University, one of the revolutionary features of the<br />\nplan was the abandonment, in the near future, of the first two<br />\nyears of collegiate instruction and the abolishment of the<br />\nCollege of Arts and Sciences. The student body would be<br />\ncomposed of only those students who sought a higher degree<br />\nthan the Bachelor of Arts.<br />\nFor various reasons, since the first enunciation of the plan,<br />\nthe apparently fairly imminent abolition of the College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences has been placed in the category of an \"ultimate<br />\nend.\" And more recently it has become more and more apparent that this part of the plan cannot become a reality for years<br />\nto come. Hopkins needs the undergraduate department. It is<br />\nhardly heresy to say, particularly, that the University needs<br />\nthe income derived from the undergraduates' tuition fees.<br />\nThis is an undisputed fact. Of course, it is conceivable that<br />\nsome wealthy man or institution such as the General Educational Board might suddenly present the University with a<br />\nfew million dollars, but we shall let you draw your own conclusions as to the probability of this..<br />\nFor the past year the University has centered its attention<br />\nupon the New Plan. The undergraduate department has received little notice and considerable neglect. The list of courses<br />\nhas been drastically cut, and many students are being subjected to high school pedagogical methods at the hands of<br />\nearnest and well-meaning, but green, student assistants.<br />\nThe unfortunate situation that now exists was almost inevitable, however. The past year has been one of transition and<br />\nexperiment, one in which the undergraduate department was<br />\nbound to suffer. The censure that has been passed upon the<br />\nadministration by many of the students should, more rightfully, have been cast upon the existing circumstances.<br />\nMany members of the faculty realize that the College of<br />\nArts and Sciences canot be abolished for some time to come.<br />\nThey realize, moreover, that if this is the case, the undergraduates are deserving of more consideration than the catalogue accords them at present. Before the end of the year, we<br />\nhave good reason to believe, several changes will take place<br />\nthat will grant to the students in the College a wider range of<br />\ncourses and a more satisfactory working basis generally. In<br />\nplace of the two or three courses now being offered in any one<br />\ndepartment, it is quite probable that a system will be inaugurated wherein five or six courses will be given, although in<br />\nalternate years. Such a plan would allow the departments<br />\nto keep within their budgets, but at the same time would<br />\nallow students to take more than two courses in any subject.<br />\nIt is undoubtedly an improvement over the present scheme of<br />\nstarvation.<br />\nUnless we are very much mistaken, the College next year<br />\nshould be a much more satisfactory place to attend than it has<br />\nbeen so far this year. We do not strike this note of optimism<br />\nwith any misgivings: We believe that the administration<br />\nrealizes that certain conditions are unsatisfactory, and will<br />\ntake steps, shortly, to remedy them.<br /><br />\nthis als<br />\nIf it zv(<br /><br />\nENERAL ELECTRIC<br /><br />\nGENERAL<br /><br />\nELECTRIC<br /><br />\nCOMPANY.<br /><br />\nSCHENECTADY.<br /><br />\nNEW<br /><br />\nYORK<br /><br />\nlege<br />\nNea<br /><br />\nsin<br />\nA<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, JANUARY 6, 1928<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS<br /><br />\nAn interfraternity war is appar- crease of responsibility will gradently in the process of conception ually overcome the excessive abat Ohio State University.
