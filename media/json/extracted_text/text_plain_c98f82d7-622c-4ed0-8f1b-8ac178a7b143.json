Witness the<br />\ndisruptive acts that have been committed and planned thus<br />\nfar., A banner across the steps to the Upper Quad inciting<br />\nstudents to fight the \"calender;\" perhaps someone should<br />\nbe fighting illiteracy. Tonight, a \"boogie\" against the<br />\nchange--dances have really been known to shake up the<br />\nAdministration. And the possibility of walking out of the<br />\nCommemoration DayCeremonies, which would surely bring<br />\na pleasant wave good-by from Muller.<br />\nThe problem seems to stem from the Student Council's<br />\nbasic approach to all situations, whether a food co-op or a<br />\ncalendar change. They like to throw dances, have open<br />\nmeetings with all students, write reports when necessary. In<br />\nshort, they view everything as an \"activity\" which needs<br />\nonly a dose .of junior-high school pep to make it<br />\nworthwhile. Without the ability to recognize the serious<br />\ndifference between an ordinary student-related function<br />\nand a real question of student power, the Student Council<br />\ncontinues ineffectively along its fun-for-all path.

Shall the<br />\ndata confirm that the minority<br />\npercentage is as a result of<br />\n\"affirmative action\" programs?<br />\nWhat further is to be said<br />\nabout the fact that there is now a<br />\nthirty-five percent<br />\nunemployment rate among Black<br />\nPh.D.'s? That is fifteen percent<br />\nhigher than the national average,<br />\nMr. Schultz.<br />\nWhat is affirmative action<br />\nreally? Is it the wholesale sell.<br />\nout of institutions of higher<br />\neducation, that Mr. Schultz seems<br />\nto indicate? Or is it something<br />\nmore serious? I see it as a<br />\nperpetuation of the false<br />\ntokenism of the fifties and<br />\nsixties. Some delightfully<br />\ncourageous but non-threatening<br />\nnumber is arbitrarily snatched<br />\nfrom the air and then a quota is<br />\nfilled. Wow, the liberal<br />\nconscience is assuaged.

I lifted her<br />\nfrom the pedestal and stood her<br />\nbehind a block of marble, where<br />\nI helped her into my jeans. I<br />\nsnatched the fig leaf as it floated<br />\ndown and stuck it in my pocket.<br />\nThe zipper caught; she scritched.<br />\nI backed down and pulled it up<br />\nagain, cautiously. I stretched the<br />\ntee shirt over her head and<br />\npopped her arms through the<br />\nholes.<br />\nShe had no expression and was<br />\nstill too clumsy to walk.

In a<br />\nfew minutes we tried to leave.<br />\nShe walked like an adolescent<br />\nrobot, rigid and lumbering. I<br />\nwasn't sure if standing still for<br />\n3,000 years or if the twentieth<br />\ncentury clothing was making her<br />\nbungle. 1 had my arm around her,<br />\nhoping she would pass as a<br />\ncripple.<br />\nWe walked by a statue of<br />\nMenelaus bedecked in armor, the<br />\nreins of the chariot horses still in<br />\nhis hands.

She complained about her<br />\npants; they clung so tightly they<br />\nseemed like a denim skin.<br />\n\"Would you take us to the<br />\nHotel Ilion, please?\" I asked the<br />\ndriver.<br />\n[he cars circling Omonia<br />\nSquare made her cringe.

I tried hard to remember<br />\nwhat<br />\nancient Greeks ate that<br />\nI knew how to fix. Olives and<br />\noranges seemed pretty easy. I<br />\nalso had some break and fetta. I<br />\nuncorked a bottle of Retsina. She<br />\nemptied two glasses in half as<br />\nmany minutes.<br />\n\"When did Menelaus die?\" she<br />\nasked while we were eating.<br />\n\"Well, you two returned to<br />\nSparta in negative 1176.

They like to throw dances, have open<br />\nmeetings with all students, write reports when necessary. In<br />\nshort, they view everything as an \"activity\" which needs<br />\nonly a dose .of junior-high school pep to make it<br />\nworthwhile. Without the ability to recognize the serious<br />\ndifference between an ordinary student-related function<br />\nand a real question of student power, the Student Council<br />\ncontinues ineffectively along its fun-for-all path.

Shall the<br />\ndata confirm that the minority<br />\npercentage is as a result of<br />\n\"affirmative action\" programs?<br />\nWhat further is to be said<br />\nabout the fact that there is now a<br />\nthirty-five percent<br />\nunemployment rate among Black<br />\nPh.D.'s? That is fifteen percent<br />\nhigher than the national average,<br />\nMr. Schultz.<br />\nWhat is affirmative action<br />\nreally? Is it the wholesale sell.<br />\nout of institutions of higher<br />\neducation, that Mr. Schultz seems<br />\nto indicate? Or is it something<br />\nmore serious? I see it as a<br />\nperpetuation of the false<br />\ntokenism of the fifties and<br />\nsixties.

I<br />\nsnatched the fig leaf as it floated<br />\ndown and stuck it in my pocket.<br />\nThe zipper caught; she scritched.<br />\nI backed down and pulled it up<br />\nagain, cautiously. I stretched the<br />\ntee shirt over her head and<br />\npopped her arms through the<br />\nholes.<br />\nShe had no expression and was<br />\nstill too clumsy to walk. A kiss<br />\nwould thin that limestone blood,<br />\nand since she wasn't fully<br />\nconscious I wouldn't feel guilty.<br />\nHell, what was my doctoral thesis<br />\non anyhow?<br />\nPassing visitors pulled up one<br />\ncorner of their mouths and<br />\nturned their children the other<br />\nway. Oh well. If I told them she<br />\nwas a statue, they'd never believe<br />\nme. If I told them I was studying<br />\nher, they'd say, \"study her in<br />\nprivate,\" or else they'd call a<br />\nguard who'd call a psychiatrist<br />\nwho'd call the American<br />\nEmbassy who'd call Hopkins and<br />\nthat would be a fate worse than<br />\nbeing a statue.<br />\nI talked to Helena to kill time<br />\nand to appear less suspicious. In a<br />\nfew minutes we tried to leave.<br />\nShe walked like an adolescent<br />\nrobot, rigid and lumbering. I<br />\nwasn't sure if standing still for<br />\n3,000 years or if the twentieth<br />\ncentury clothing was making her<br />\nbungle. 1 had my arm around her,<br />\nhoping she would pass as a<br />\ncripple.<br />\nWe walked by a statue of<br />\nMenelaus bedecked in armor, the<br />\nreins of the chariot horses still in<br />\nhis hands. Helena's eyes darted at<br />\nhim, then quickly away. She was<br />\nstraignt-tacect.<br />\nOutside, I waved to a taxi. We<br /><br />\ngot in back.<br />\nPoil tha? the driver asked.<br />\n\"J ust drive around<br />\ndowntown.\"<br />\nShe was quite impressed with<br />\nthe 'self-propelled chariot'. \"Pori<br />\niomen?\" she asked.<br />\n\"I'm going to show you how<br />\nAthens has changed in 3,000<br />\nyears.\"<br />\nWe rode around the Acropolis,<br />\nthe Temple of Zeus, and the<br />\nAgora. She complained about her<br />\npants; they clung so tightly they<br />\nseemed like a denim skin.<br />\n\"Would you take us to the<br />\nHotel Ilion, please?\" I asked the<br />\ndriver.<br />\n[he cars circling Omonia<br />\nSquare made her cringe. I pulled<br />\nher toward me; she pressed her<br />\nhead in my shoulder.<br />\nAt the hotel I led her up to my<br />\nroom. I tried hard to remember<br />\nwhat<br />\nancient Greeks ate that<br />\nI knew how to fix. Olives and<br />\noranges seemed pretty easy. I<br />\nalso had some break and fetta. I<br />\nuncorked a bottle of Retsina. She<br />\nemptied two glasses in half as<br />\nmany minutes.<br />\n\"When did Menelaus die?\" she<br />\nasked while we were eating.<br />\n\"Well, you two returned to<br />\nSparta in negative 1176. I think<br />\nhe died within the next thirty<br />\nyears.\"<br />\n\"And what year did you say<br />\nthis is? Positive 1977?\"<br />\nI nodded; then: \"yes. That<br />\nmakes it about 3,123 years ago.\"<br />\n\"That's really a long time.\"<br />\nShe popped olives into her<br />\nmouth.<br />\nI sipped my Retsina. \"Sorry<br />\nabout the tight pants.\"<br />\n\"Oh, that's all right, but aren't<br />\nthey dangerous?\"<br />\n\"If they still bother you, I<br />\nhave other clothes you car<br />\nwear.\"<br />\n\"All right,\" she said eagerly.<br />\n\"You can wear my bathrobe<br />\nuntil I find a nice dress.\" I<br />\nshowed her what a bathrobe was.<br />\nI turned around so she could<br />\nchange.<br />\nShe laughed slightly as she<br />\nsettled back into the chair.\"You<br />\nknow, if this ir really positive<br />\n1977, that means I haven't been<br />\nwith a man in over 3,000 years.\"<br />\nShe spit seeds into the orange<br />\npeel.<br />\n\"That's a long time.\" 1<br />\nthought seriously about my<br />\ndissertation. My pen and paper<br />\nwere by the bed. I walked over to<br />\nHelena and. knelt before her. Do<br />\nyou mind if I call you Lenny?\"<br />\n\"Lenny? No,but why?\"<br />\n'Well, someone else once<br />\ncalled you Helena, but that was<br />\nanother age. 'Lenny' is modern.\"<br />\nI took her hands in mine,<br />\nkissing her on the ear. She<br />\nshuddered. I untied the bathrobe,<br />\nand let it fall onto the back of the<br />\nchair. I carried her to my bed.<br />\nHer smile was closed but<br />\npleasant. She was more supple<br />\nnow than when I had lifted her in<br />\nthe museum.<br />\nI tried to go in but parts of her<br />\ndown there were still marble.<br />\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"It's<br />\nbeen a long time.\"<br />\nIn an hour I made it.<br />\nFourteen hours later 1 had<br />\nfinished most of my field<br /><br />\nresearch, Lenny had<br />\n\"Oh, no.\" I said; \"Not even a<br />\ncompensated for her 3,123 year Trojan.\" 1 thought quickly. \"1'01<br />\nibstention, and I felt better from Mycenae.
