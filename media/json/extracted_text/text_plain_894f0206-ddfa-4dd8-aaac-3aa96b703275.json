As a<br />\nSentence draws toward a<br />\nPause each syllable rolls forth<br />\nMore slowly and quietly until<br />\nthe voice is gone.<br />\nAnd as you begin to speak,<br />\non the assumption that the<br />\nthought is complete, Lowe<br />\ntakes his corncob pipe from<br />\nhis mouth and finishes the<br />\nthought in a chuckling<br />\nstaccato.<br />\n\"There is too much selfrighteousness<br />\nprevalent<br />\ntoday. Good sense and good<br />\nWill hardly have a chance.<br />\nThey are bowled over by<br />\ndesire for mil-i-tannt accction<br />\nwhich is much<br />\nMore exciting of course.\"<br />\nThe effect is dramatic, but<br />\nLowe says that his pauses are<br />\nnot for drama's sake. \"It<br />\ntakes me a while to think of<br />\nWhat I want to say.\"<br />\nIt may take a while, but<br />\nLowe has no lack of things to<br />\nsaY. In his 23rd year at<br />\nHopkins, he is a careful and<br />\naccurate observer of the<br />\nhe<br />\nUniversity, though<br />\nProtests that other faculty<br />\nMembers have a wider scope<br />\nof contact than he.<br />\nWhen Lowe came to<br />\n1947, the<br />\nHopkins in<br />\nPhilosophy Department had<br />\ntwo professors; he has seen it<br />\ngrow to its present comPosition of 11 faculty members.<br />\n<br />\nHe has also seen the advent<br />\nof bureaucracy and the<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nproliferation<br />\nprofessional administrator.<br />\nHe says, \"Of course, in 1947,<br />\nthe idea that there should be<br />\ndifferent stickers for faculty,<br />\nadministrators and students<br />\nwho own cars would have<br />\nbeen fantastic.\" Lowe is not<br />\npleased by this type of<br />\nchange, but judges that it was<br />\nalmost inevitable.<br />\nHe also perceives a<br />\ndramatic change in the tone of,<br />\nthe student body, and student<br />\nprotest. He remembers that<br />\nthere was little protest from<br />\nthe student body when he<br />\ncame to Hopkins from Ohio<br />\nState.<br />\n\"But there was some by the<br />\nbetter ones (students and<br />\nfaculty) against that wicked<br />\nmonkey business of Senator<br />\nJoe McCarthy.\"<br />\nWhatever the issue, Lowe<br />\nsees no justification for<br />\nviolence. He sees himself as a<br />\nreflective man and often<br />\nfinds evidence of unreasoned<br />\nor hasty action.<br />\nBut at times, he is also<br />\nimpatient with his own<br />\ndisinclination for action. He<br />\nviews the balance between<br />\nreflection and action as \"a<br />\nconstant problem -- most of us<br />\nare either inpulsive, or like<br />\nme, neurotically inhabited.\"<br />\nThe man whom he believes<br />\nachieved just the proper<br />\nbalance is William James.<br />\n\"James,\" he says, \"had a<br />\nwonderful combination of<br />\nimaginative tolerance for<br />\npeople who differed from him<br />\nand firmness, in non-violent<br />\nmilitancy -- a peaceable<br />\n<br />\nmilitant liberal. This is the<br />\ncombination needed today.\"<br />\nWilliam James is one of<br />\nLowe's pet subjects but he is<br />\nnot the thinker to whom Lowe<br />\nhas devoted the most study.<br />\nThe life and work of Alfred<br />\nNorth Whitehead is Lowe's<br />\nprimary area of expertise.<br />\nwith<br />\nconnection<br />\nHis<br />\nWhitehead goes back 40<br />\nyears. After receiving his<br />\nB.S. from Case School of<br />\nApplied Science in Electrical<br />\nEngineering, Lowe went to<br />\nHarvard expressly to study<br />\nunder Whitehead. \"God<br />\nnever intended me to be an<br />\nElectrical Engineer,\" he<br />\nsays.<br />\nWhen Lowe remembers<br />\nWhitehead as a teacher he<br />\nlooks up and far away; a<br />\nsmile plays around his lips.<br />\nHe pauses for a long time -longer than normal -- and<br />\nshrugs saying \"Whitehead<br />\nwas Whitehead,\" and he<br />\nchuckles. \"This made him<br />\nunlike anyone else \u2014 he was a<br />\nreal philosopher -- in him<br />\nphilosophizing had not.been<br />\noverwhelmed by being a<br />\nprofessional philosopher. He<br />\nwas the wisest man I've ever<br />\nrun across.\"<br />\n\"His lectures were rather<br />\nrambling -- he taught with<br />\nwisdom -- and not a mild sort<br />\nof wisdom -- very firm and<br />\nemphatic.\" Lowe is careful to<br />\npoint out that he is not a<br />\ndisciple of Whitehead. He<br />\ncites C.I.

In a<br />\nblantant show of force, they took it upon themselves to<br />\ndecide a philosophic question for the community,<br />\noverturning the results of a popular referendum which<br />\nhad decided the same philosophic question the \"wrong<br />\nway.\"<br />\nOperating from a position of moral certitude and<br />\nchildish superiority, they chose to wring their own<br />\n\"symbolic victory\" out of the Defense Department<br />\ndilemma.They did so not by deciding to lift the ban on<br />\nrecruiting. That had to come. It was a fact of life. But<br />\nrather by employing a trumped up moral question as the<br />\nargumental backbone of that decision. In short, their<br />\ndecision had little to do with what President Gordon<br />\ncalled last week \"an entirely different set of circumstances from what was known or foreseeable at the<br />\ntime of the referendum last April.\"<br />\nAt a press conference following the decision Wednesday,President Gordon said candidly \"In the view of<br />\nthe Trustees, the principle of the open campus was more<br />\nimportant than the financial\" considerations attached<br />\nto losing nearly $3 million in Defense Department grants<br />\nand contracts. Presumably, it was also more important<br />\nthan the contemplated loss of nearly 100 jobs.<br />\nThe question of the propriety of an open university<br />\nwas not the question before the Board, the President or<br />\nthe Deans whom the President asked for recommendations. Nonetheless, nearly all saw fit to give the<br />\nphilosophical question of an open university top billing<br />\nover the practical matters of jobs and funding.<br />\nFurthermore, the Executive Committee of the Board<br />\nsaid that its review of the situation had \"taken into<br />\naccount the events of last April leading to the decision to<br />\nsuspend recruitment.\" It had no business doing so. The<br />\nevents of last spring are irrelevent. They culminated in<br />\nthe largest popular referendum in Homewood history.<br />\nThat referendum decided the issue of military<br />\nrecruitment in moral terms. We understood that the<br />\nissue was being raised once again only in the light of new<br />\nand unavoidable facts. Although the Board never formally approved the referendum, their acquiescence was<br />\nwidely viewed as a fait accomopli.<br />\nWhat occurred Wednesday was an oligarchical<br />\nreversal of a democratic decision. We acquiesced out of<br />\na regard for practicality.<br />\nIn reverting to a \"holier than thou\" morality, the<br />\nBoard President Gordon and the Deans collectively<br />\noverstepped their bounds. They merit our disrespect.<br />\n<br />\nOpen University?<br />\nAmid all the talk of an open campus comes the<br />\nrealization that Hopkins is very much closed. Take the<br />\nBoard of Trustees meeting Wednesday morning. The<br />\nStrike Committee's requests for a postponement of the<br />\nmeeting to allow planning for an open convocation were<br />\nturned down by the administration. The News-Letter<br />\ntried unsuccessfully for days to find out the time and<br />\nlocation of the meeting. Stumbling upon it after seeing a<br />\npastry truck pull up to the rear of Shriver Hall, a NewsLetter reporter found the door to the meeting room<br />\nlocked and the Chief of Campus Security on guard<br />\noutside.<br />\nLater in the same day, the Academic Council convened at Shriver. Its meetings are traditionally closed<br />\nand the News-Letter learns only by chance of the<br />\ntimes. This time, security was so stringent that a NewsLetter reporter, waiting to question members after the<br />\nmeeting, was not even allowed to seat himself near the<br />\ndoor.<br />\n<br />\nConcerts : Same Song<br />\nBy JIM PHELPS<br />\nSame old story, same old song...What's<br />\nhappening to the quality of student \"life\" at<br />\nthis university? I speak specifically of that<br />\nelusive entity, an integrated on-campus<br />\n\"social life.\" But it's elusive perhaps only on<br />\nthis campus. The social doldrums continue<br />\nat J.H.U. The question is obviously...Why?<br />\nAs a start, prices of \"big name\" groups<br />\nare, in a word, astronomical. Coupled with<br />\nthe smallsize of the student body, the fact<br />\nthat there are numerous social outlets in the<br />\nBalto.-Wash. area (as opposed to, say,<br />\nBuck nell, located in Lewisburg,Pa.), and the<br />\nlack of a really adequate auditorium make<br />\nconcerts a losing proposition at Hopkins.<br />\nThese losses come out of the Student<br />\nCouncil's social budget, which is about<br />\n$10,000 for 1970-71 . Yet the fractionalization<br />\nthat off-campus living provides and the<br />\nreluctance to pay large sums, i.e.; $4 plus<br />\nper ticket, (though people do pay for Civic<br />\nCenter concerts) places the concert situation<br />\nin a difficult position indeed.<br />\n$22,000 Lost<br />\nTwo years ago the concert program was<br />\nextensive and varied; it went from Count<br />\nBasie to the Vanilla Fudge, with Ritchie<br />\nHavens, Sergio Mendes, Tim Hardin, and<br />\nCharlie Byrd in between. But it lost $22,000.<br />\nLast year the opposite extreme (Lighthouse,<br />\nPaul Butterfield, and Charlie Byrd) was<br />\nreached. This year an attempt to strike a<br />\nbalance was begun with the Chambers<br />\nBrothers; no, they're not a \"supergroup\"<br />\nanymore, but they are known to put on a<br />\ngood show, the quad offered a relaxed atmosphere and there was a mixer/ dance<br />\nafterward.<br />\nAll in all, an evening with great potential.<br />\nYet the large loss (over $4000) might lead one<br />\nto believe as incorrect the contention of last<br />\nyear that the system was'not a fault and that<br />\nimplementation problems was the cause of<br />\nmonetary loss ( which obviously restricts<br />\nfuture social affairs).<br />\n<br />\nAdditional sources of money to absorb the<br />\nloss are being sought. Possibilities of cosponsoring a concert with Towson State<br />\nand/ or Loyola are being investigated.<br />\nBut this takes time. Meanwhile fraternity<br />\nrush was rescheduled for second semester.<br />\nIn addition, a final tally of Chambers<br />\nBrothers costs was delayed. The combination of these occurrences left about two<br />\nweeks to organize a concert for October 16\u2014a<br />\nveritable impossibility. Thus the \"relaxed<br />\natmosphere\" dance sponsored by APO (\"It's<br />\nBetter than Nothinw) was put together, and<br />\nthe concert was pushed back to November<br />\n20.<br />\n\"The Flock\"<br />\nWith the financial constraints noted above,<br />\nthe only course of action for the Nov. 20<br />\nconcert seemed to be to book a relatively<br />\ninexpensive group, one \"on the way up,\" and<br />\none for which a low admission could be<br />\ncharged. losses would be minimized, thus<br />\nallowing for more activities second<br />\nsemester. Consequently, \"The Flock\", a<br />\ngroup that John Mayall described as \"the<br />\nbest American rock group\", will appear on<br />\nNovember 20, for the remarkably cheap<br />\nprice of $2.00 a head.<br />\nMaybe you've never heard of \"the Flock,\"<br />\nmaybe you couldn't care less--and maybe<br />\nthere's the whole problem. You can't please<br />\neveryone all of the time, yet why bother to<br />\neven attempt to please anyone who quite<br />\nhonestly doesn't give a damn? Still have a<br />\ngripe? Want more information? Have any<br />\nconstructive ideas, suggestions? How about<br />\na hand in the decision-making process?<br />\nInput is needed in all of thse regards\u2014and<br />\nyou can reach me at Box 533. In the meantime, why not try a little on-campus<br />\nsocializing--be it a dance that's \"Better than<br />\nNothin\".<br />\nJim Phelps, the Vice-President of the Student<br />\nCouncil, is responsible for Council-sponsored<br />\nactivities.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nhonor Commission Replies<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe criticisms directed<br />\nagainst the Honor Commission's<br />\nproposal<br />\nto<br />\neliminate the drop-date and<br />\npass-fail deadline in your<br />\neditorial of October 13<br />\nevidences a lack of understanding of the reasoning<br />\nand motives of the Commission in presenting this<br />\nproposal.<br />\nOur first assumption is that<br />\none's academic transcript is<br />\nnot a device for punishing a<br />\nstudent who has for some<br />\nreason not succeeded in some<br />\narea; a transcript is rather a<br />\nrecord of one's achievenment,<br />\nand should<br />\nindicate only what a student<br />\nhas achieved.

This also means, for<br />\nthe trust to be meaningful,<br />\nthat someone or some body-hopefully not just the Administration at Hopkins,<br />\nwhich freely proclaims that it<br />\nis responsible only to the<br />\nBoard of Trustees\u2014must have<br />\nstanding to enforce that trust<br />\nobligation.<br />\nBut, to enforce a trust<br />\nobligation one must know<br />\nmore about the laws of<br />\nMaryland, Hopkins' charter<br />\nof incorporation, and our<br />\nbylaws, all of which provide<br />\nthe legal framework within<br />\nwhich Hopkins is ruled...<br />\nThe ultimate questions are<br />\nwhat kinds of obligations does<br />\nthe university have to its<br />\n<br />\nvarious constituencies, who is<br />\nto determine the content of<br />\nthose obligations, and what<br />\nconstituencies are to have the<br />\nright to enforce them.<br />\nSince these matters seem<br />\npeculiarly significant for<br />\nthose connected with the<br />\nuniversity who regularly get<br />\nthe short end of the stick, may<br />\nI respectfully suggest that<br />\nrepresentatives of such<br />\ngroups\u2014the Student Council<br />\nor the Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization, for example-might pursue the point, to the<br />\ncontheir<br />\nbenefit of<br />\nstituencies.<br />\nRic Pfeffer<br />\nAssistant Professor<br />\nPolitical Science<br />\n<br />\nused few different types of<br />\nsubjects.

This move was<br />\nmade under incrasing pressure from small<br />\ncolleges which did not have the budgets to<br />\nrun freshman programs in baseball. The<br />\nrules of the Mid-Atlantic Conference (MAC)<br />\nare the same as the NCAA rules.<br />\nHopkins does not allow freshmen to play<br />\nvaristy sports. This is the ruling of the<br />\nDepartment of Athletics. Hopkins is a<br />\nuniversity that is presently going through a<br />\nfinancial crisis. Every year there is some<br />\nprofessor who decides that the best way to<br />\ncut down on expenses is to cut out the<br />\nathletic program. Students must now pay to<br />\nbring wives and dates to football, basketball<br />\nand lacrosse games.<br />\nThe Athletic department overlooks what<br />\nmay be one of the easiest ways to cut costs.<br />\nCut out the freshman sports programs in the<br />\nminor sports. The result will be a considerable savings.<br />\nThere are full freshman schedules in<br />\ntrack and cross-country when there aren't<br />\neven enough runners to fill a varisty team.<br />\n<br />\nThere are full freshman schedules in track<br />\nand cross-country when there aren't even<br />\nenough runners to fill a varsity team, there<br />\nis a freshman wrestling team when the<br />\nvarsity has to forfeit weight classes in every<br />\nmatch. The same is true of the golf team the<br />\nswimming team, and the fencing team. For<br />\nthem, having freshmen on varsity squads<br />\nwould be a boost, and would help keep frosh<br />\ninterested.<br />\nDifferent Story<br />\nWith some other teams the story is different. The tennis and baseball teams suffer<br />\nfrom another problem. They have enough<br />\npeople to field teams, but their facilities are<br />\nterribly overtaxed. There are only six tennis<br />\ncourts available to the team. This means a<br />\nmaximum of 24 players if everyone plays<br />\ndoubles. Because they are not eligible for the<br />\nvarsity, freshmen can only use the courts<br />\nwhen the varsity is not practicing.<br />\nThere is only one field for the baseball<br />\nteam to practice on. Because of this, the<br />\nfreshmen practice only when the varsity<br />\ndoes not and has to constantly settle for a<br />\nsecond-rate athletic program.<br />\nI call on Athletic Director Marshall Turner<br />\nto open his eyes to the situation as it exists<br />\ntoday. There is no real reason for keeping<br />\nfreshmen from participating in varsity<br />\nathletics.

As a<br />\nSentence draws toward a<br />\nPause each syllable rolls forth<br />\nMore slowly and quietly until<br />\nthe voice is gone.<br />\nAnd as you begin to speak,<br />\non the assumption that the<br />\nthought is complete, Lowe<br />\ntakes his corncob pipe from<br />\nhis mouth and finishes the<br />\nthought in a chuckling<br />\nstaccato.<br />\n\"There is too much selfrighteousness<br />\nprevalent<br />\ntoday. Good sense and good<br />\nWill hardly have a chance.<br />\nThey are bowled over by<br />\ndesire for mil-i-tannt accction<br />\nwhich is much<br />\nMore exciting of course.\"<br />\nThe effect is dramatic, but<br />\nLowe says that his pauses are<br />\nnot for drama's sake. \"It<br />\ntakes me a while to think of<br />\nWhat I want to say.\"<br />\nIt may take a while, but<br />\nLowe has no lack of things to<br />\nsaY. In his 23rd year at<br />\nHopkins, he is a careful and<br />\naccurate observer of the<br />\nhe<br />\nUniversity, though<br />\nProtests that other faculty<br />\nMembers have a wider scope<br />\nof contact than he.<br />\nWhen Lowe came to<br />\n1947, the<br />\nHopkins in<br />\nPhilosophy Department had<br />\ntwo professors; he has seen it<br />\ngrow to its present comPosition of 11 faculty members.<br /><br />\nHe has also seen the advent<br />\nof bureaucracy and the<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nproliferation<br />\nprofessional administrator.<br />\nHe says, \"Of course, in 1947,<br />\nthe idea that there should be<br />\ndifferent stickers for faculty,<br />\nadministrators and students<br />\nwho own cars would have<br />\nbeen fantastic.\" Lowe is not<br />\npleased by this type of<br />\nchange, but judges that it was<br />\nalmost inevitable.<br />\nHe also perceives a<br />\ndramatic change in the tone of,<br />\nthe student body, and student<br />\nprotest. He remembers that<br />\nthere was little protest from<br />\nthe student body when he<br />\ncame to Hopkins from Ohio<br />\nState.<br />\n\"But there was some by the<br />\nbetter ones (students and<br />\nfaculty) against that wicked<br />\nmonkey business of Senator<br />\nJoe McCarthy.\"<br />\nWhatever the issue, Lowe<br />\nsees no justification for<br />\nviolence. He sees himself as a<br />\nreflective man and often<br />\nfinds evidence of unreasoned<br />\nor hasty action.<br />\nBut at times, he is also<br />\nimpatient with his own<br />\ndisinclination for action. He<br />\nviews the balance between<br />\nreflection and action as \"a<br />\nconstant problem -- most of us<br />\nare either inpulsive, or like<br />\nme, neurotically inhabited.\"<br />\nThe man whom he believes<br />\nachieved just the proper<br />\nbalance is William James.<br />\n\"James,\" he says, \"had a<br />\nwonderful combination of<br />\nimaginative tolerance for<br />\npeople who differed from him<br />\nand firmness, in non-violent<br />\nmilitancy -- a peaceable<br /><br />\nmilitant liberal. This is the<br />\ncombination needed today.\"<br />\nWilliam James is one of<br />\nLowe's pet subjects but he is<br />\nnot the thinker to whom Lowe<br />\nhas devoted the most study.<br />\nThe life and work of Alfred<br />\nNorth Whitehead is Lowe's<br />\nprimary area of expertise.<br />\nwith<br />\nconnection<br />\nHis<br />\nWhitehead goes back 40<br />\nyears. After receiving his<br />\nB.S. from Case School of<br />\nApplied Science in Electrical<br />\nEngineering, Lowe went to<br />\nHarvard expressly to study<br />\nunder Whitehead. \"God<br />\nnever intended me to be an<br />\nElectrical Engineer,\" he<br />\nsays.<br />\nWhen Lowe remembers<br />\nWhitehead as a teacher he<br />\nlooks up and far away; a<br />\nsmile plays around his lips.<br />\nHe pauses for a long time -longer than normal -- and<br />\nshrugs saying \"Whitehead<br />\nwas Whitehead,\" and he<br />\nchuckles. \"This made him<br />\nunlike anyone else \u2014 he was a<br />\nreal philosopher -- in him<br />\nphilosophizing had not.been<br />\noverwhelmed by being a<br />\nprofessional philosopher. He<br />\nwas the wisest man I've ever<br />\nrun across.\"<br />\n\"His lectures were rather<br />\nrambling -- he taught with<br />\nwisdom -- and not a mild sort<br />\nof wisdom -- very firm and<br />\nemphatic.\" Lowe is careful to<br />\npoint out that he is not a<br />\ndisciple of Whitehead. He<br />\ncites C.I. Lewis, who also<br />\ntaught him at Harvard, as<br />\nanother major influence on<br />\nhis philosophic thinking.<br />\nor<br />\nBut, whether disciple<br />\nscholar, Lowe is certainly the<br /><br />\non<br />\nexpert<br />\nreigning<br />\nWhitehead's thought and life.<br />\nHe has been working on a<br />\nbiography of his former<br />\nteacher for the past five<br />\nyears. He hopes to have it<br />\ncompleted by the middle of<br />\n1972. \"The man himself,\"<br />\nsays Lowe \"has become a<br />\nlegendary figure.

Hollis, Stuart Seidel<br /><br />\n'Board'My Shepherd\u2022 \u2022 \u2022<br />\nThe Board of Trustees was more than practical in<br />\ndeciding to lift the ban on military recruiting. In a<br />\nblantant show of force, they took it upon themselves to<br />\ndecide a philosophic question for the community,<br />\noverturning the results of a popular referendum which<br />\nhad decided the same philosophic question the \"wrong<br />\nway.\"<br />\nOperating from a position of moral certitude and<br />\nchildish superiority, they chose to wring their own<br />\n\"symbolic victory\" out of the Defense Department<br />\ndilemma.They did so not by deciding to lift the ban on<br />\nrecruiting. That had to come. It was a fact of life. But<br />\nrather by employing a trumped up moral question as the<br />\nargumental backbone of that decision. In short, their<br />\ndecision had little to do with what President Gordon<br />\ncalled last week \"an entirely different set of circumstances from what was known or foreseeable at the<br />\ntime of the referendum last April.\"<br />\nAt a press conference following the decision Wednesday,President Gordon said candidly \"In the view of<br />\nthe Trustees, the principle of the open campus was more<br />\nimportant than the financial\" considerations attached<br />\nto losing nearly $3 million in Defense Department grants<br />\nand contracts. Presumably, it was also more important<br />\nthan the contemplated loss of nearly 100 jobs.<br />\nThe question of the propriety of an open university<br />\nwas not the question before the Board, the President or<br />\nthe Deans whom the President asked for recommendations. Nonetheless, nearly all saw fit to give the<br />\nphilosophical question of an open university top billing<br />\nover the practical matters of jobs and funding.<br />\nFurthermore, the Executive Committee of the Board<br />\nsaid that its review of the situation had \"taken into<br />\naccount the events of last April leading to the decision to<br />\nsuspend recruitment.\" It had no business doing so. The<br />\nevents of last spring are irrelevent. They culminated in<br />\nthe largest popular referendum in Homewood history.<br />\nThat referendum decided the issue of military<br />\nrecruitment in moral terms. We understood that the<br />\nissue was being raised once again only in the light of new<br />\nand unavoidable facts. Although the Board never formally approved the referendum, their acquiescence was<br />\nwidely viewed as a fait accomopli.<br />\nWhat occurred Wednesday was an oligarchical<br />\nreversal of a democratic decision. We acquiesced out of<br />\na regard for practicality.<br />\nIn reverting to a \"holier than thou\" morality, the<br />\nBoard President Gordon and the Deans collectively<br />\noverstepped their bounds. They merit our disrespect.<br /><br />\nOpen University?<br />\nAmid all the talk of an open campus comes the<br />\nrealization that Hopkins is very much closed. Take the<br />\nBoard of Trustees meeting Wednesday morning. The<br />\nStrike Committee's requests for a postponement of the<br />\nmeeting to allow planning for an open convocation were<br />\nturned down by the administration. The News-Letter<br />\ntried unsuccessfully for days to find out the time and<br />\nlocation of the meeting. Stumbling upon it after seeing a<br />\npastry truck pull up to the rear of Shriver Hall, a NewsLetter reporter found the door to the meeting room<br />\nlocked and the Chief of Campus Security on guard<br />\noutside.<br />\nLater in the same day, the Academic Council convened at Shriver. Its meetings are traditionally closed<br />\nand the News-Letter learns only by chance of the<br />\ntimes. This time, security was so stringent that a NewsLetter reporter, waiting to question members after the<br />\nmeeting, was not even allowed to seat himself near the<br />\ndoor.<br /><br />\nConcerts : Same Song<br />\nBy JIM PHELPS<br />\nSame old story, same old song...What's<br />\nhappening to the quality of student \"life\" at<br />\nthis university? I speak specifically of that<br />\nelusive entity, an integrated on-campus<br />\n\"social life.\" But it's elusive perhaps only on<br />\nthis campus. The social doldrums continue<br />\nat J.H.U. The question is obviously...Why?<br />\nAs a start, prices of \"big name\" groups<br />\nare, in a word, astronomical. Coupled with<br />\nthe smallsize of the student body, the fact<br />\nthat there are numerous social outlets in the<br />\nBalto.-Wash. area (as opposed to, say,<br />\nBuck nell, located in Lewisburg,Pa.), and the<br />\nlack of a really adequate auditorium make<br />\nconcerts a losing proposition at Hopkins.<br />\nThese losses come out of the Student<br />\nCouncil's social budget, which is about<br />\n$10,000 for 1970-71 . Yet the fractionalization<br />\nthat off-campus living provides and the<br />\nreluctance to pay large sums, i.e.; $4 plus<br />\nper ticket, (though people do pay for Civic<br />\nCenter concerts) places the concert situation<br />\nin a difficult position indeed.<br />\n$22,000 Lost<br />\nTwo years ago the concert program was<br />\nextensive and varied; it went from Count<br />\nBasie to the Vanilla Fudge, with Ritchie<br />\nHavens, Sergio Mendes, Tim Hardin, and<br />\nCharlie Byrd in between. But it lost $22,000.<br />\nLast year the opposite extreme (Lighthouse,<br />\nPaul Butterfield, and Charlie Byrd) was<br />\nreached. This year an attempt to strike a<br />\nbalance was begun with the Chambers<br />\nBrothers; no, they're not a \"supergroup\"<br />\nanymore, but they are known to put on a<br />\ngood show, the quad offered a relaxed atmosphere and there was a mixer/ dance<br />\nafterward.<br />\nAll in all, an evening with great potential.<br />\nYet the large loss (over $4000) might lead one<br />\nto believe as incorrect the contention of last<br />\nyear that the system was'not a fault and that<br />\nimplementation problems was the cause of<br />\nmonetary loss ( which obviously restricts<br />\nfuture social affairs).<br /><br />\nAdditional sources of money to absorb the<br />\nloss are being sought. Possibilities of cosponsoring a concert with Towson State<br />\nand/ or Loyola are being investigated.<br />\nBut this takes time. Meanwhile fraternity<br />\nrush was rescheduled for second semester.<br />\nIn addition, a final tally of Chambers<br />\nBrothers costs was delayed. The combination of these occurrences left about two<br />\nweeks to organize a concert for October 16\u2014a<br />\nveritable impossibility. Thus the \"relaxed<br />\natmosphere\" dance sponsored by APO (\"It's<br />\nBetter than Nothinw) was put together, and<br />\nthe concert was pushed back to November<br />\n20.<br />\n\"The Flock\"<br />\nWith the financial constraints noted above,<br />\nthe only course of action for the Nov. 20<br />\nconcert seemed to be to book a relatively<br />\ninexpensive group, one \"on the way up,\" and<br />\none for which a low admission could be<br />\ncharged. losses would be minimized, thus<br />\nallowing for more activities second<br />\nsemester. Consequently, \"The Flock\", a<br />\ngroup that John Mayall described as \"the<br />\nbest American rock group\", will appear on<br />\nNovember 20, for the remarkably cheap<br />\nprice of $2.00 a head.<br />\nMaybe you've never heard of \"the Flock,\"<br />\nmaybe you couldn't care less--and maybe<br />\nthere's the whole problem. You can't please<br />\neveryone all of the time, yet why bother to<br />\neven attempt to please anyone who quite<br />\nhonestly doesn't give a damn? Still have a<br />\ngripe? Want more information? Have any<br />\nconstructive ideas, suggestions? How about<br />\na hand in the decision-making process?<br />\nInput is needed in all of thse regards\u2014and<br />\nyou can reach me at Box 533. In the meantime, why not try a little on-campus<br />\nsocializing--be it a dance that's \"Better than<br />\nNothin\".<br />\nJim Phelps, the Vice-President of the Student<br />\nCouncil, is responsible for Council-sponsored<br />\nactivities.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nhonor Commission Replies<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe criticisms directed<br />\nagainst the Honor Commission's<br />\nproposal<br />\nto<br />\neliminate the drop-date and<br />\npass-fail deadline in your<br />\neditorial of October 13<br />\nevidences a lack of understanding of the reasoning<br />\nand motives of the Commission in presenting this<br />\nproposal.<br />\nOur first assumption is that<br />\none's academic transcript is<br />\nnot a device for punishing a<br />\nstudent who has for some<br />\nreason not succeeded in some<br />\narea; a transcript is rather a<br />\nrecord of one's achievenment,<br />\nand should<br />\nindicate only what a student<br />\nhas achieved.

This also means, for<br />\nthe trust to be meaningful,<br />\nthat someone or some body-hopefully not just the Administration at Hopkins,<br />\nwhich freely proclaims that it<br />\nis responsible only to the<br />\nBoard of Trustees\u2014must have<br />\nstanding to enforce that trust<br />\nobligation.<br />\nBut, to enforce a trust<br />\nobligation one must know<br />\nmore about the laws of<br />\nMaryland, Hopkins' charter<br />\nof incorporation, and our<br />\nbylaws, all of which provide<br />\nthe legal framework within<br />\nwhich Hopkins is ruled...<br />\nThe ultimate questions are<br />\nwhat kinds of obligations does<br />\nthe university have to its<br /><br />\nvarious constituencies, who is<br />\nto determine the content of<br />\nthose obligations, and what<br />\nconstituencies are to have the<br />\nright to enforce them.<br />\nSince these matters seem<br />\npeculiarly significant for<br />\nthose connected with the<br />\nuniversity who regularly get<br />\nthe short end of the stick, may<br />\nI respectfully suggest that<br />\nrepresentatives of such<br />\ngroups\u2014the Student Council<br />\nor the Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization, for example-might pursue the point, to the<br />\ncontheir<br />\nbenefit of<br />\nstituencies.<br />\nRic Pfeffer<br />\nAssistant Professor<br />\nPolitical Science<br /><br />\nused few different types of<br />\nsubjects.

This move was<br />\nmade under incrasing pressure from small<br />\ncolleges which did not have the budgets to<br />\nrun freshman programs in baseball. The<br />\nrules of the Mid-Atlantic Conference (MAC)<br />\nare the same as the NCAA rules.<br />\nHopkins does not allow freshmen to play<br />\nvaristy sports. This is the ruling of the<br />\nDepartment of Athletics. Hopkins is a<br />\nuniversity that is presently going through a<br />\nfinancial crisis. Every year there is some<br />\nprofessor who decides that the best way to<br />\ncut down on expenses is to cut out the<br />\nathletic program. Students must now pay to<br />\nbring wives and dates to football, basketball<br />\nand lacrosse games.<br />\nThe Athletic department overlooks what<br />\nmay be one of the easiest ways to cut costs.<br />\nCut out the freshman sports programs in the<br />\nminor sports. The result will be a considerable savings.<br />\nThere are full freshman schedules in<br />\ntrack and cross-country when there aren't<br />\neven enough runners to fill a varisty team.<br /><br />\nThere are full freshman schedules in track<br />\nand cross-country when there aren't even<br />\nenough runners to fill a varsity team, there<br />\nis a freshman wrestling team when the<br />\nvarsity has to forfeit weight classes in every<br />\nmatch. The same is true of the golf team the<br />\nswimming team, and the fencing team. For<br />\nthem, having freshmen on varsity squads<br />\nwould be a boost, and would help keep frosh<br />\ninterested.<br />\nDifferent Story<br />\nWith some other teams the story is different. The tennis and baseball teams suffer<br />\nfrom another problem. They have enough<br />\npeople to field teams, but their facilities are<br />\nterribly overtaxed. There are only six tennis<br />\ncourts available to the team. This means a<br />\nmaximum of 24 players if everyone plays<br />\ndoubles. Because they are not eligible for the<br />\nvarsity, freshmen can only use the courts<br />\nwhen the varsity is not practicing.<br />\nThere is only one field for the baseball<br />\nteam to practice on. Because of this, the<br />\nfreshmen practice only when the varsity<br />\ndoes not and has to constantly settle for a<br />\nsecond-rate athletic program.<br />\nI call on Athletic Director Marshall Turner<br />\nto open his eyes to the situation as it exists<br />\ntoday. There is no real reason for keeping<br />\nfreshmen from participating in varsity<br />\nathletics.
