Rocks of the Westminster<br />\nterrane are metamorphic (greenschist facies) that reflect multiple<br />\nphases of deformation.<br />\n<br />\nRecent geologic mapping in the Piedmont has resulted in<br />\nstratigraphic and structural relationships for these rocks of the<br />\nWestminster terrane that differ from interpretations of Fisher, who<br />\nproduced a geologic map of this quadrangle in 1978. In general, the<br />\ncurrent map retains Fisher\u2019's geologic contacts and structural<br />\n\u201cmeasurements but revises the structural and stratigraphic relationships<br />\n(including formation names) to offer an interpretation consistent with<br />\nthe recent regional interpretations. Limited field reconnaissance<br />\nduring the preparation of this current map resulted in a few relatively<br />\nminor revisions to Fisher\u2019s contacts.<br />\n<br />\nRegional Piedmont mapping (e.g., Southworth and others, 2002)<br />\nindicates that the Westminster terrane consists of polymetamorphic<br />\nrocks that occur in fault-bounded packages, or assemblages. Each<br />\npackage contains a variety of lithologies that are often similar from<br />\none package to another but lithologies vary in their relative<br />\nproportions in different packages.<br />\n<br />\nIn the New Windsor quadrangle the lithologies can be grouped<br />\ninto two distinct assemblages of greenschist-facies metamorphic<br />\nrocks: one consisting mainly of metasedimentary rocks, the other<br />\ncontaining a considerable amount of metavolcanic rocks and marble<br />\nalong with metasedimentary rocks.<br />\n<br />\nThe mainly metasedimentary assemblage consists predominantly<br />\nof phyllites and schists, with subordinate metalimestone and<br />\nmetabasalt and minor amounts of quartzite. The Marburg Formation<br />\nand Prettyboy Schist constitute this assemblage in the map area.<br />\nThese rocks are thought to represent original sedimentary<br />\naccumulations in offshore, deep-water depositional environments.<br />\n<br />\nThe metavolcanic and metasedimentary assemblage includes<br />\nmetabasalt of the Sams Creek Formation as well as phyllites,<br />\nlimestone, quartzite, and large to small bodies of Wakeficld Marble.<br />\nThe metabasalts represent ocean floor deposits and possibly the<br />\nremains of volcanic islands or seamounts built on oceanic crust<br />\n(Smith and Barnes, 1994; Southworth, 1996). The associated marble<br />\nappears to represent shallow-water carbonates that formed in<br />\nproximity to volcanic islands or seamounts.<br />\n<br />\nThe ages of these two rock sequences have not been determined,<br />\nbut estimates range from as old as Late Proterozoic and Cambrian to<br />\nas young as Early Ordovician. Southworth and others (2002) depict<br />\nall metamorphic rocks of the Westminster terrane to have been<br />\ndeposited during the Late Proterozoic to Early Cambrian. These<br />\ndeposits were subsequently subjected to several phases of<br />\ndeformation and metamorphism during the Paleozoic<br />\n<br />\nThe Westminster terrane lies unconformably beneath the<br />\nLate Triassic New Oxford Formation in the northwest corner of the<br />\nquadrangle. It is also intruded with subparallel north-striking diabase<br />\ndikes of Jurassic age. Surficial deposits of Quaternary alluvium are<br />\nfound along modern streams.<br />\n<br />\nSTRUCTURE<br />\nSummary<br />\n<br />\nBedrock units of the Westminster terrane have a complex<br />\nstructural and metamorphic history. Regionally the Westminster<br />\nterrane 1s characterized by polydeformed and polymetamorphosed<br />\nrocks in a system of imbricate thrust sheets (e.g., Southworth, 1996,<br />\n1998, 1999; Southworth and others, 2002.)<br />\n<br />\nIn the New Windsor quadrangle, the metavolcanic and<br />\nmetasedimentary rocks of the Sams Creek Formation and the<br />\nassociated Wakefield Marble appear to be structurally separate from<br />\nthe areas underlain by the Marburg Formation and Prettyboy Schist.<br />\nThe precise structural disposition of these units is unclear, but may be<br />\na fault contact (Edwards, 1993a and 1993b; Southworth and others,<br />\n2002). This stands in clear contrast to mapping by Fisher (1978),<br />\nwho recognized fewer faults in the arca. High-angle faults of the<br />\nCranberry fault system, interpreted to be compressional in nature, cut<br />\nthrough the metasedimentary assemblage (Marburg Formation and<br />\nPrettyboy Schist) and appear to separate this assemblage from the<br />\nmetavolcanic-metasedimentary assemblage (Sams Creek Formation).<br />\nSouthworth (1998; 1999) and Southworth and others (2002) indicate<br />\nthat the contact between the Marburg and Sams Creek Formations is a<br />\nthrust fault.<br />\n<br />\nTriassic rocks of the New Oxford Formation, in the northwest<br />\ncorner of the map, represent part of the Gettysburg Basin. It is widely<br />\naccepted that early Mesozoic continental rifting formed the<br />\nGettysburg Basin. This basin was originally connected to a second<br />\nbasin, the Culpeper Basin, and together they formed a large down-<br />\nfaulted basin that filled with sediments eroding from Blue Ridge and<br />\nPiedmont highlands (Southworth and others, 2002).<br />\n<br />\nFolds<br />\n<br />\nFisher (1978) provided a detailed discussion of fold history in the<br />\n.New Windsor quadrangle. The current map has not altered Fisher\u2019s<br />\n(1978) imnterpretation of fold history. Therefore, a summary of his<br />\ninterpretations is provided below; refer to Fisher\u2019s 1978 map for full<br />\ndiscussion and details.<br />\n<br />\nFisher (1978) recognized three major generations of folding in the<br />\nNew Windsor quadrangle. These are, from oldest to youngest, the<br />\nWakefield Valley folds (W), the Marston folds (M), and the Jasontown<br />\nfolds (J). These folds are identified both on Fisher\u2019s (1978) map and<br />\non the current geologic map by the letters W, M, and J, respectively,<br />\non the fold axes. There are some folds that are of uncertain age and<br />\nare unmarked on the map.<br />\n<br />\nFisher indicated that the earliest generation of folds, the<br />\nWakefield Valley folds, appear closest the original form along the<br />\naxis of the Marston synform where the effects of the subsequent<br />\ndeformation is minimized. Cross section A-A\" on this map follows<br />\nthat of Fisher (1978) and is a two-part (offset) cross section following<br />\nthe Marston synform.<br />\n<br />\nWakefield folds were deformed by the Marston generation of<br />\ndeformation. =~ Marston generation folds generally have north-<br />\nnortheast trending axial planes and are associated with cleavage that<br />\ntrends parallel to the fold axial planes. Subsequently, the Jasontown<br />\ngeneration of folding produced several steeply dipping, northeast<br />\ntrending kink zones that offset strike lines of the Marston cleavage.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to the principal fold generations, there may have been<br />\none or more other generations of deformation based on complex<br />\ncrenulation cleavages and associated crinkles and minor folds visible<br />\nin many outcrops. These features do not appear to discernibly affect<br />\nthe map pattern and, because the time relationships are far from clear,<br />\nFisher did not divide them into named fold generations.<br />\n<br />\nFaults<br />\n<br />\nFisher (1978) recognized at least two generations of steeply<br />\ndipping faults in the New Windsor quadrangle. Those offsetting the<br />\nTriassic rocks are presumably normal faults associated with<br />\ncontinental rifting that formed the Gettysburg Basin during the<br />\nMesozoic. A much earlier set of faults appears to have been folded<br />\nby the Marston cleavage. Fisher\u2019s cross sections indicated the \u201ccarly<br />\nfaults\u201d dip to the southeast. Although Fisher showed this earlier set<br />\nas normal faults, he admitted that the relative sense of motion was<br />\nuncertain and that they could be reverse faults. Based on regional<br />\nmapping and related revisions to the structural-tectonic framework<br />\n(e.g., Edwards, written communication, 1997; Southworth and others,<br />\n2002), the current map shows Fisher\u2019s \u201cearly faults\u2122 as reverse faults,<br />\nsteeply dipping to the southeast. Presumably these early faults<br />\nresulted from compressional forces associated with orogenic events<br />\nduring the Paleozoic.<br />\n<br />\nMapping in the surrounding quadrangles by Edwards (1993a,<br />\n1993b, 1994, 1996) identified a series of additional subparallel faults,<br />\nwhich he collectively called the Cranberry fault system. Although he<br />\ninitially interpreted these as east-verging, high-angle reverse faults, he<br />\nlater considered them to be west-verging, high-angle reverse faults<br />\n(Edwards, written communication, 1997). Each fault is actually a<br />\nnarrow band, or zone, of closely spaced, parallel or en echelon faults.<br />\nIn places, some of the faults show a component of strike slip<br />\nmovement. Dips range from nearly vertical to steeply southeast.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough not mapped by Fisher (1978), two of those faults \u2014 the<br />\nCranberry fault and the Avondale fault \u2014 trend at approximately<br />\nN30\u00b0E as they cross the southeastern part of the New Windsor<br />\nquadrangle. The Avondale fault appears to form the boundary for the<br />\nrevised packaging of the lithologic units in the map area, separating<br />\nthe Sams Creek Formation-Wakefiecld Marble on the west (footwall)<br />\nfrom the Marburg Formation on the east side (hanging wall).<br />\n<br />\nRegionally, the traces of the Avondale and Cranberry faults are<br />\nrelatively straight and do not appear to be strongly affected by<br />\nfolding. Therefore, the Cranberry fault system appears to postdate<br />\nFisher\u2019s \u201cearly faults.\u201d Edwards (1993b) suggested that the Avondale<br />\nand Cranberry faults are likely to represent a final phase of Paleozoic<br />\ndeformation, presumably the Alleghenian orogeny. He speculated<br />\nthat faulting could be contemporaneous with Marston folding, given<br />\nprominent crenulation cleavage that parallels these faults in the<br />\nWestminster quadrangle (just east of New Windsor).<br />\n<br />\nSTRATIGRAPHY AND CORRELATION<br />\n<br />\nThe reinterpretation of the structural-lithologic framework of the<br />\nareca produces two fault-bounded assemblages in the map area: the<br />\nPrettyboy Schist-Marburg Formation to the east and the Sams Creek<br />\nFormation-Wakefield Marble to the west. Stratigraphic interpretation<br />\nand correlation of rock units are hampered by poor exposure and<br />\nstructural complexity, as well as by the lack of fossils and absolute<br />\ndates. Most primary sedimentary and volcanic structures in the rock<br />\nunits have been obscured or obliterated by folding, foliation, and<br />\nrecrystallization. To a large extent, carly-formed structures and<br />\nfoliation have been destroyed or modified by later episodes of<br />\ntectonism.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral of Fisher's (1978) rock units have been reassigned to<br />\nother formations in the current map. In general, the Wissahickon<br />\nalbite phyllite of Fisher (1978) is now mapped as the Prettyboy Schist<br />\necast of the Avondale Fault. Recent field reconnaissance shows that<br />\nphyllites formerly assigned to Wissahickon by Fisher (1978) are more<br />\nschistose than phyllitic. Fisher's Ijamsville phyllites west of the<br />\nAvondale fault are now mapped as phyllite members of the Sams<br />\nCreck Formation and east of the Avondale fault as phyllites of the<br />\nMarburg Formation and Prettyboy Schist. Fisher's Silver Run<br />\nLimestone has been reassigned to the Sams Creek Formation in the<br />\n<br />\ncurrent interpretation. The relatively small bodies of metabasalt east<br />\nof the Avondale fault, which were formerly identified as Sams Creek<br />\ngreenstone, are now mapped as part of the Marburg and Prettyboy<br />\nFormations. It is possible that these small bodies of metabasalt may<br />\nbe detached and isolated remnants of Sams Creck metabasalt or its<br />\nequivalent. Stratigraphic continuity, however, cannot be established.<br />\nOn this map, the Sams Creek Formation is absent east of the<br />\nAvondale fault, presumably as a result of erosion following tectonic<br />\ndeformation and faulting.<br />\n<br />\nThe Sams Creek Formation as shown of this map now includes<br />\nlithologies of metabasalt, phyllites, quartzite, limestone and marbles.<br />\nWith the reassignment of much of Fisher's (1978) Ijamsville phyllite<br />\nwest of Avondale fault into the revised Sams Creek Formation,<br />\nmetabasalt is no longer the dominant lithology, in terms of outcrop<br />\narea, in the Sams Creek Formation in the New Windsor quadrangle.<br />\nHowever, the formation still contains considerable amounts of<br />\nmetabasalt, more than any of the other formations on the current map.<br />\n<br />\nThe age of the Sams Creck Formation remains a matter of some<br />\nspeculation. Edwards (1993b) considered it the oldest unit in the<br />\nareca. Southworth and others (2002), however, suggest that the Sams<br />\nCreek Formation may stratigraphically overliec \u2014 and therefore be<br />\nyounger than \u2014 the Marburg Formation in this part of the Piedmont.<br />\n<br />\nFisher (1978) considered the Sams Creeck Formation to be<br />\nCambrian(?) or possibly young Ordovician(?) in age. Edwards<br />\n(1984) equated the Sams Creek with the Late Proterozoic Catoctin<br />\nFormation, and Southworth and others (2002) considered it to be Late<br />\nProterozoic(?) to Early Cambrian(?).<br />\n<br />\nThe Wakefield Marble is spatially associated with the Sams<br />\nCreek Formation and is most clearly expressed by the fold belt and<br />\nbroad valleys in the central and southwestern parts of the map area.<br />\nThe Wakefield Marble has been considered younger than the Sams<br />\nCreek Formation (e.g., Fisher, 1978), as a member within the Sams<br />\nCreek (e.g., Edwards, 1986), or even older than the Sams Creek (e.g.,<br />\nJonas and Stose, 1938). Due to the Wakefield Marble\u2019s axial position<br />\nin the synforms and its being flanked by the Sams Creck metabasalt,<br />\nthe current map concurs with Fisher\u2019s interpretation and retains<br />\nformation status for the Wakefield Marble, at least for the major<br />\noutcrop areas associated with the fold belt that occurs in the map area.<br />\n<br />\nThe Silver Run Limestone and associated phyllite member are<br />\nhere included in the Sams Creek Formation. Fisher (1978) included it<br />\nin the Ijamsville Phyllite, which is not recognized on the current map,<br />\nand Edwards (1986) included it as a member of the Marburg<br />\nFormation. As currently mapped, the Silver Run Limestone occurs at<br />\nor near the top of the Sams Creek Formation. Fisher (1978)<br />\ninterpreted the alternating graded clastic carbonate beds and<br />\nargillaceous material of the Silver Run as representing the periodic<br />\ninflux of carbonate debris (possibly turbidites or a polymictic slide<br />\nmass) derived from a Cambrian and Ordovician carbonate shelf to the<br />\nnorthwest into a shale basin. If so, the Silver Run probably represents<br />\nthe distal edge of an off-shelf carbonate wedge and associated slide<br />\nmasses represented by parts of the Frederick Formation, west of the<br />\nNew Windsor quadrangle (Brezinski, 2004).<br />\n<br />\nThe Marburg Formation is predominantly made up of various<br />\nphyllites with minor quartzite and metabasalt (greenstone) in the map<br />\nareca. The original depositional environment of the Marburg<br />\nFormation has been interpreted as offshore marine (deepwater-rise)<br />\n(e.g., Kunk and others, 2004). Edwards (1984, 1986) proposed a<br />\nCambrian to Ordovician age for the Marburg, though others suggest<br />\nages ranging from possibly Late Proterozoic and/or Cambrian (e.g.,<br />\nDrake, 1994; Southworth 1998; Southworth and others 2002).<br />\n<br />\nThe stratigraphic relationship between the Marburg Formation<br />\nand adjacent units is not fully defined. In the New Windsor<br />\nquadrangle, the contact between the Marburg and the Sams Creek<br />\nFormations is shown as a high-angle reverse fault (the Avondale<br />\nfault). Southworth and others (2002) suggest that the Marburg may<br />\nstratigraphically underlic the Sams Creek Formation and may<br />\nstructurally overlie the Prettyboy Schist in the vicinity. Due to<br />\nsimilarities in lithology, however, previous authors have suggested<br />\nthat the Marburg Formation and Prettyboy Schist may have originally<br />\nhad a facies relationship, with the Marburg more proximal and<br />\nPrettyboy Schist more distal (Drake, 1994; Howard, 1994).<br />\n<br />\nThe Prettyboy Schist is the uppermost unit in what was<br />\npreviously known as the Wissahickon Group, a name now abandoned<br />\nin Maryland (Gates and others, 1991). The current map shows<br />\nPrettyboy Schist where Fisher (1978) showed Wissahickon albite<br />\nphyllite east of the Avondale fault. The Prettyboy consists mainly of<br />\nuniform, fine-grained plagioclase-chlorite-muscovite-quartz schist,<br />\nwith euhedral albite porphyroblasts common.  However, the<br />\nPrettyboy, as shown on the current map, also contains boudins of<br />\nphyllite, metabasalt, and quartzite. Crowley (1976), who named the<br />\nPrettyboy Schist, assigned its age as Cambro-Ordovician(?).<br />\nHowever, Drake (1994) revised the age to Late Proterozoic and Early<br />\nCambrian, a designation continued in later mapping (e.g., Southworth<br />\nand others, 2002) and retained on the current map.<br />\n<br />\nCV<br />\n<br />\n     <br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n   <br />\n<br />\n\u20acZsceqp<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n  <br />\n<br />\nMeters<br />\n200<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n\u20acZsccpa -200<br />\n<br />\n      <br />\n  <br />\n   <br />\n<br />\n<<br />\n\u20acZsccp -<br />\n<br />\n  <br />\n<br />\n\u20acZpg \u20acZpm \u20aczZpg R'<br />\n_, Meters<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n  <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n\u00a37sc \u20acZmb<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n    <br />\n<br />\n  <br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nCZscmp<br />\nMeters<br />\n( .<br />\nExplanation of Map Symbols<br />\nGeologic Symbols<br />\nContacts .<br />\n.~ Geologic contact; approximately located L .

Rocks of the Westminster<br />\nterrane are metamorphic (greenschist facies) that reflect multiple<br />\nphases of deformation.<br /><br />\nRecent geologic mapping in the Piedmont has resulted in<br />\nstratigraphic and structural relationships for these rocks of the<br />\nWestminster terrane that differ from interpretations of Fisher, who<br />\nproduced a geologic map of this quadrangle in 1978. In general, the<br />\ncurrent map retains Fisher\u2019's geologic contacts and structural<br />\n\u201cmeasurements but revises the structural and stratigraphic relationships<br />\n(including formation names) to offer an interpretation consistent with<br />\nthe recent regional interpretations. Limited field reconnaissance<br />\nduring the preparation of this current map resulted in a few relatively<br />\nminor revisions to Fisher\u2019s contacts.<br /><br />\nRegional Piedmont mapping (e.g., Southworth and others, 2002)<br />\nindicates that the Westminster terrane consists of polymetamorphic<br />\nrocks that occur in fault-bounded packages, or assemblages. Each<br />\npackage contains a variety of lithologies that are often similar from<br />\none package to another but lithologies vary in their relative<br />\nproportions in different packages.<br /><br />\nIn the New Windsor quadrangle the lithologies can be grouped<br />\ninto two distinct assemblages of greenschist-facies metamorphic<br />\nrocks: one consisting mainly of metasedimentary rocks, the other<br />\ncontaining a considerable amount of metavolcanic rocks and marble<br />\nalong with metasedimentary rocks.<br /><br />\nThe mainly metasedimentary assemblage consists predominantly<br />\nof phyllites and schists, with subordinate metalimestone and<br />\nmetabasalt and minor amounts of quartzite. The Marburg Formation<br />\nand Prettyboy Schist constitute this assemblage in the map area.<br />\nThese rocks are thought to represent original sedimentary<br />\naccumulations in offshore, deep-water depositional environments.<br /><br />\nThe metavolcanic and metasedimentary assemblage includes<br />\nmetabasalt of the Sams Creek Formation as well as phyllites,<br />\nlimestone, quartzite, and large to small bodies of Wakeficld Marble.<br />\nThe metabasalts represent ocean floor deposits and possibly the<br />\nremains of volcanic islands or seamounts built on oceanic crust<br />\n(Smith and Barnes, 1994; Southworth, 1996). The associated marble<br />\nappears to represent shallow-water carbonates that formed in<br />\nproximity to volcanic islands or seamounts.<br /><br />\nThe ages of these two rock sequences have not been determined,<br />\nbut estimates range from as old as Late Proterozoic and Cambrian to<br />\nas young as Early Ordovician. Southworth and others (2002) depict<br />\nall metamorphic rocks of the Westminster terrane to have been<br />\ndeposited during the Late Proterozoic to Early Cambrian. These<br />\ndeposits were subsequently subjected to several phases of<br />\ndeformation and metamorphism during the Paleozoic<br /><br />\nThe Westminster terrane lies unconformably beneath the<br />\nLate Triassic New Oxford Formation in the northwest corner of the<br />\nquadrangle. It is also intruded with subparallel north-striking diabase<br />\ndikes of Jurassic age. Surficial deposits of Quaternary alluvium are<br />\nfound along modern streams.<br /><br />\nSTRUCTURE<br />\nSummary<br /><br />\nBedrock units of the Westminster terrane have a complex<br />\nstructural and metamorphic history. Regionally the Westminster<br />\nterrane 1s characterized by polydeformed and polymetamorphosed<br />\nrocks in a system of imbricate thrust sheets (e.g., Southworth, 1996,<br />\n1998, 1999; Southworth and others, 2002.)<br /><br />\nIn the New Windsor quadrangle, the metavolcanic and<br />\nmetasedimentary rocks of the Sams Creek Formation and the<br />\nassociated Wakefield Marble appear to be structurally separate from<br />\nthe areas underlain by the Marburg Formation and Prettyboy Schist.<br />\nThe precise structural disposition of these units is unclear, but may be<br />\na fault contact (Edwards, 1993a and 1993b; Southworth and others,<br />\n2002). This stands in clear contrast to mapping by Fisher (1978),<br />\nwho recognized fewer faults in the arca. High-angle faults of the<br />\nCranberry fault system, interpreted to be compressional in nature, cut<br />\nthrough the metasedimentary assemblage (Marburg Formation and<br />\nPrettyboy Schist) and appear to separate this assemblage from the<br />\nmetavolcanic-metasedimentary assemblage (Sams Creek Formation).<br />\nSouthworth (1998; 1999) and Southworth and others (2002) indicate<br />\nthat the contact between the Marburg and Sams Creek Formations is a<br />\nthrust fault.<br /><br />\nTriassic rocks of the New Oxford Formation, in the northwest<br />\ncorner of the map, represent part of the Gettysburg Basin. It is widely<br />\naccepted that early Mesozoic continental rifting formed the<br />\nGettysburg Basin. This basin was originally connected to a second<br />\nbasin, the Culpeper Basin, and together they formed a large down-<br />\nfaulted basin that filled with sediments eroding from Blue Ridge and<br />\nPiedmont highlands (Southworth and others, 2002).<br /><br />\nFolds<br /><br />\nFisher (1978) provided a detailed discussion of fold history in the<br />\n.New Windsor quadrangle. The current map has not altered Fisher\u2019s<br />\n(1978) imnterpretation of fold history. Therefore, a summary of his<br />\ninterpretations is provided below; refer to Fisher\u2019s 1978 map for full<br />\ndiscussion and details.<br /><br />\nFisher (1978) recognized three major generations of folding in the<br />\nNew Windsor quadrangle. These are, from oldest to youngest, the<br />\nWakefield Valley folds (W), the Marston folds (M), and the Jasontown<br />\nfolds (J). These folds are identified both on Fisher\u2019s (1978) map and<br />\non the current geologic map by the letters W, M, and J, respectively,<br />\non the fold axes. There are some folds that are of uncertain age and<br />\nare unmarked on the map.<br /><br />\nFisher indicated that the earliest generation of folds, the<br />\nWakefield Valley folds, appear closest the original form along the<br />\naxis of the Marston synform where the effects of the subsequent<br />\ndeformation is minimized. Cross section A-A\" on this map follows<br />\nthat of Fisher (1978) and is a two-part (offset) cross section following<br />\nthe Marston synform.<br /><br />\nWakefield folds were deformed by the Marston generation of<br />\ndeformation. =~ Marston generation folds generally have north-<br />\nnortheast trending axial planes and are associated with cleavage that<br />\ntrends parallel to the fold axial planes. Subsequently, the Jasontown<br />\ngeneration of folding produced several steeply dipping, northeast<br />\ntrending kink zones that offset strike lines of the Marston cleavage.<br /><br />\nIn addition to the principal fold generations, there may have been<br />\none or more other generations of deformation based on complex<br />\ncrenulation cleavages and associated crinkles and minor folds visible<br />\nin many outcrops. These features do not appear to discernibly affect<br />\nthe map pattern and, because the time relationships are far from clear,<br />\nFisher did not divide them into named fold generations.<br /><br />\nFaults<br /><br />\nFisher (1978) recognized at least two generations of steeply<br />\ndipping faults in the New Windsor quadrangle. Those offsetting the<br />\nTriassic rocks are presumably normal faults associated with<br />\ncontinental rifting that formed the Gettysburg Basin during the<br />\nMesozoic. A much earlier set of faults appears to have been folded<br />\nby the Marston cleavage. Fisher\u2019s cross sections indicated the \u201ccarly<br />\nfaults\u201d dip to the southeast. Although Fisher showed this earlier set<br />\nas normal faults, he admitted that the relative sense of motion was<br />\nuncertain and that they could be reverse faults. Based on regional<br />\nmapping and related revisions to the structural-tectonic framework<br />\n(e.g., Edwards, written communication, 1997; Southworth and others,<br />\n2002), the current map shows Fisher\u2019s \u201cearly faults\u2122 as reverse faults,<br />\nsteeply dipping to the southeast. Presumably these early faults<br />\nresulted from compressional forces associated with orogenic events<br />\nduring the Paleozoic.<br /><br />\nMapping in the surrounding quadrangles by Edwards (1993a,<br />\n1993b, 1994, 1996) identified a series of additional subparallel faults,<br />\nwhich he collectively called the Cranberry fault system. Although he<br />\ninitially interpreted these as east-verging, high-angle reverse faults, he<br />\nlater considered them to be west-verging, high-angle reverse faults<br />\n(Edwards, written communication, 1997). Each fault is actually a<br />\nnarrow band, or zone, of closely spaced, parallel or en echelon faults.<br />\nIn places, some of the faults show a component of strike slip<br />\nmovement. Dips range from nearly vertical to steeply southeast.<br /><br />\nAlthough not mapped by Fisher (1978), two of those faults \u2014 the<br />\nCranberry fault and the Avondale fault \u2014 trend at approximately<br />\nN30\u00b0E as they cross the southeastern part of the New Windsor<br />\nquadrangle. The Avondale fault appears to form the boundary for the<br />\nrevised packaging of the lithologic units in the map area, separating<br />\nthe Sams Creek Formation-Wakefiecld Marble on the west (footwall)<br />\nfrom the Marburg Formation on the east side (hanging wall).<br /><br />\nRegionally, the traces of the Avondale and Cranberry faults are<br />\nrelatively straight and do not appear to be strongly affected by<br />\nfolding. Therefore, the Cranberry fault system appears to postdate<br />\nFisher\u2019s \u201cearly faults.\u201d Edwards (1993b) suggested that the Avondale<br />\nand Cranberry faults are likely to represent a final phase of Paleozoic<br />\ndeformation, presumably the Alleghenian orogeny. He speculated<br />\nthat faulting could be contemporaneous with Marston folding, given<br />\nprominent crenulation cleavage that parallels these faults in the<br />\nWestminster quadrangle (just east of New Windsor).<br /><br />\nSTRATIGRAPHY AND CORRELATION<br /><br />\nThe reinterpretation of the structural-lithologic framework of the<br />\nareca produces two fault-bounded assemblages in the map area: the<br />\nPrettyboy Schist-Marburg Formation to the east and the Sams Creek<br />\nFormation-Wakefield Marble to the west. Stratigraphic interpretation<br />\nand correlation of rock units are hampered by poor exposure and<br />\nstructural complexity, as well as by the lack of fossils and absolute<br />\ndates. Most primary sedimentary and volcanic structures in the rock<br />\nunits have been obscured or obliterated by folding, foliation, and<br />\nrecrystallization. To a large extent, carly-formed structures and<br />\nfoliation have been destroyed or modified by later episodes of<br />\ntectonism.<br /><br />\nSeveral of Fisher's (1978) rock units have been reassigned to<br />\nother formations in the current map. In general, the Wissahickon<br />\nalbite phyllite of Fisher (1978) is now mapped as the Prettyboy Schist<br />\necast of the Avondale Fault. Recent field reconnaissance shows that<br />\nphyllites formerly assigned to Wissahickon by Fisher (1978) are more<br />\nschistose than phyllitic. Fisher's Ijamsville phyllites west of the<br />\nAvondale fault are now mapped as phyllite members of the Sams<br />\nCreck Formation and east of the Avondale fault as phyllites of the<br />\nMarburg Formation and Prettyboy Schist. Fisher's Silver Run<br />\nLimestone has been reassigned to the Sams Creek Formation in the<br /><br />\ncurrent interpretation. The relatively small bodies of metabasalt east<br />\nof the Avondale fault, which were formerly identified as Sams Creek<br />\ngreenstone, are now mapped as part of the Marburg and Prettyboy<br />\nFormations. It is possible that these small bodies of metabasalt may<br />\nbe detached and isolated remnants of Sams Creck metabasalt or its<br />\nequivalent. Stratigraphic continuity, however, cannot be established.<br />\nOn this map, the Sams Creek Formation is absent east of the<br />\nAvondale fault, presumably as a result of erosion following tectonic<br />\ndeformation and faulting.<br /><br />\nThe Sams Creek Formation as shown of this map now includes<br />\nlithologies of metabasalt, phyllites, quartzite, limestone and marbles.<br />\nWith the reassignment of much of Fisher's (1978) Ijamsville phyllite<br />\nwest of Avondale fault into the revised Sams Creek Formation,<br />\nmetabasalt is no longer the dominant lithology, in terms of outcrop<br />\narea, in the Sams Creek Formation in the New Windsor quadrangle.<br />\nHowever, the formation still contains considerable amounts of<br />\nmetabasalt, more than any of the other formations on the current map.<br /><br />\nThe age of the Sams Creck Formation remains a matter of some<br />\nspeculation. Edwards (1993b) considered it the oldest unit in the<br />\nareca. Southworth and others (2002), however, suggest that the Sams<br />\nCreek Formation may stratigraphically overliec \u2014 and therefore be<br />\nyounger than \u2014 the Marburg Formation in this part of the Piedmont.<br /><br />\nFisher (1978) considered the Sams Creeck Formation to be<br />\nCambrian(?) or possibly young Ordovician(?) in age. Edwards<br />\n(1984) equated the Sams Creek with the Late Proterozoic Catoctin<br />\nFormation, and Southworth and others (2002) considered it to be Late<br />\nProterozoic(?) to Early Cambrian(?).<br /><br />\nThe Wakefield Marble is spatially associated with the Sams<br />\nCreek Formation and is most clearly expressed by the fold belt and<br />\nbroad valleys in the central and southwestern parts of the map area.<br />\nThe Wakefield Marble has been considered younger than the Sams<br />\nCreek Formation (e.g., Fisher, 1978), as a member within the Sams<br />\nCreek (e.g., Edwards, 1986), or even older than the Sams Creek (e.g.,<br />\nJonas and Stose, 1938). Due to the Wakefield Marble\u2019s axial position<br />\nin the synforms and its being flanked by the Sams Creck metabasalt,<br />\nthe current map concurs with Fisher\u2019s interpretation and retains<br />\nformation status for the Wakefield Marble, at least for the major<br />\noutcrop areas associated with the fold belt that occurs in the map area.<br /><br />\nThe Silver Run Limestone and associated phyllite member are<br />\nhere included in the Sams Creek Formation. Fisher (1978) included it<br />\nin the Ijamsville Phyllite, which is not recognized on the current map,<br />\nand Edwards (1986) included it as a member of the Marburg<br />\nFormation. As currently mapped, the Silver Run Limestone occurs at<br />\nor near the top of the Sams Creek Formation. Fisher (1978)<br />\ninterpreted the alternating graded clastic carbonate beds and<br />\nargillaceous material of the Silver Run as representing the periodic<br />\ninflux of carbonate debris (possibly turbidites or a polymictic slide<br />\nmass) derived from a Cambrian and Ordovician carbonate shelf to the<br />\nnorthwest into a shale basin. If so, the Silver Run probably represents<br />\nthe distal edge of an off-shelf carbonate wedge and associated slide<br />\nmasses represented by parts of the Frederick Formation, west of the<br />\nNew Windsor quadrangle (Brezinski, 2004).<br /><br />\nThe Marburg Formation is predominantly made up of various<br />\nphyllites with minor quartzite and metabasalt (greenstone) in the map<br />\nareca. The original depositional environment of the Marburg<br />\nFormation has been interpreted as offshore marine (deepwater-rise)<br />\n(e.g., Kunk and others, 2004). Edwards (1984, 1986) proposed a<br />\nCambrian to Ordovician age for the Marburg, though others suggest<br />\nages ranging from possibly Late Proterozoic and/or Cambrian (e.g.,<br />\nDrake, 1994; Southworth 1998; Southworth and others 2002).<br /><br />\nThe stratigraphic relationship between the Marburg Formation<br />\nand adjacent units is not fully defined. In the New Windsor<br />\nquadrangle, the contact between the Marburg and the Sams Creek<br />\nFormations is shown as a high-angle reverse fault (the Avondale<br />\nfault). Southworth and others (2002) suggest that the Marburg may<br />\nstratigraphically underlic the Sams Creek Formation and may<br />\nstructurally overlie the Prettyboy Schist in the vicinity. Due to<br />\nsimilarities in lithology, however, previous authors have suggested<br />\nthat the Marburg Formation and Prettyboy Schist may have originally<br />\nhad a facies relationship, with the Marburg more proximal and<br />\nPrettyboy Schist more distal (Drake, 1994; Howard, 1994).<br /><br />\nThe Prettyboy Schist is the uppermost unit in what was<br />\npreviously known as the Wissahickon Group, a name now abandoned<br />\nin Maryland (Gates and others, 1991). The current map shows<br />\nPrettyboy Schist where Fisher (1978) showed Wissahickon albite<br />\nphyllite east of the Avondale fault. The Prettyboy consists mainly of<br />\nuniform, fine-grained plagioclase-chlorite-muscovite-quartz schist,<br />\nwith euhedral albite porphyroblasts common.  However, the<br />\nPrettyboy, as shown on the current map, also contains boudins of<br />\nphyllite, metabasalt, and quartzite. Crowley (1976), who named the<br />\nPrettyboy Schist, assigned its age as Cambro-Ordovician(?).<br />\nHowever, Drake (1994) revised the age to Late Proterozoic and Early<br />\nCambrian, a designation continued in later mapping (e.g., Southworth<br />\nand others, 2002) and retained on the current map.<br /><br />\nCV<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\u20acZsceqp<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nMeters<br />\n200<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\n\u20acZsccpa -200<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n&lt;<br />\n\u20acZsccp -<br /><br /><br /><br />\n\u20acZpg \u20acZpm \u20aczZpg R'<br />\n_, Meters<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\u00a37sc \u20acZmb<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nCZscmp<br />\nMeters<br />\n( .<br />\nExplanation of Map Symbols<br />\nGeologic Symbols<br />\nContacts .<br />\n.~ Geologic contact; approximately located L .
