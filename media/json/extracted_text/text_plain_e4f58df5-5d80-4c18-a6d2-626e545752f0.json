To those who have been dropped we can only wish reinstatement, or success in other lines. To those fortunate ones who<br />\nremain, tr,<br />\n;n particular, we can give more useful advice.<br />\nMuch can be learned from the examinations, from failure as well as<br />\nsuccess. The majority of new students during their first half year of<br />\ncollege work more or less in the dark. The midyears have, or should<br />\nhave, cleared up many 'doubtful points.<br />\nThose who have passed all their courses have gained confidence in<br />\nlearning that examinations are not insurmountable obstacles, but for the<br />\nmost part fair tests of one's general knowledge of a course. The students who have failed one or two courses should learn the more useful<br />\nlesson of realizing the seriousness Of college work; and of not looking<br />\nat the absence of daily work, such as that required in preparatory school,<br />\nas an opportunity to loaf through the year. They should learn how to<br />\nstudy, and realize that one week of violent cramming is worth nothing<br />\nin comparison to steady preparation and note-taking throughout the<br />\ncourse.<br />\nA little celebration and relaxation after the strain of the midyear's<br />\nis quite natural and in fact necessary, but the danger lies in over indulgence and allowing class work to slide from week to week. Now is the<br />\ntime to begin to work, for soon the rush of spring activities and an epidemic of spring fever will make study more difficult. All the men who<br />\nremain, from those oil the most ragged edge to those who were the most<br />\nsuccessful, should profit by the lessons learned in the last two weeks,<br />\nand remember that the finals will come just as inevitably as did the midyears.<br />\n<br />\nJ.<br />\nTHE SPIRIT REMAINS<br />\nWith the lifting of regulations, the \"frosh\" is no longer distinguished<br />\nfrom the presumably wiser upper-classmen. We congratulate them on<br />\ntheir release from the petty burden of cap, button, and the rest. However, it is our earnest hope that the joy of the freshmen in their newfound freedom will limit itself to the usual appalling array of glaring<br />\nsocks and neckties, rather than in the forgetting of the valuable lessons<br />\ntaught by the regulations.<br />\nThe newly emancipated freshman is still on the lowest rung of the<br />\ncollegiate ladder. If he fails to realize this even more than he did during<br />\nthe hectic \"paddle-swinging\" days of the early fall, he has missed the<br />\nspirit and purpose of the regulations. The letter of tine rules has been<br />\nremoved, but the spirit remains. There is no longer a system of game<br />\ntags, but there are still games to be supported; no more yells to be learned,<br />\nbut there are still Hopkins teams to be cheered; no more compulsory<br />\nspeaking on the campus, but the spirit of friendship should still prevail.<br />\nThe basic spirit of the regulations is to make the freshman a better<br />\nHopkins man and the \"frosh\" should \"carry on\" even more willingly, although the regulations have been lifted.<br />\n<br />\nMYSTERIOUS TRACKS DRAW INTEREST<br />\nOF CAMPUS SHERLOCK HOLMES<br />\nStarting mysteriously in front<br />\nof the main entrance of Gilman<br />\nHall, running down the steps, the<br />\nlength of the quadrangle, over the<br />\nslope, across the bowl and into<br />\nCharles street are two tracks of<br />\nautomobile tires engraved in the<br />\nfast disappearing snow.<br />\nStudents on their way to school<br />\nfor the first day of the second semester last Wednesday were astonished at the peculiar route<br />\ntaken by the wandering motorists.<br />\nMany followed the tracks up to<br />\nwhere they started on the steps<br />\nof Gilman Hall.\u2022 Some looked inquiringly at each other while others winked knowingly.<br />\nCampus sleuths have deduced<br />\nthe fact that the tracks were laid<br />\non Tuesday night, the evening of<br />\nthe last day of the exam period.<br />\nThis fact disclosed a motive for<br />\nthe deed.

To those who have been dropped we can only wish reinstatement, or success in other lines. To those fortunate ones who<br />\nremain, tr,<br />\n;n particular, we can give more useful advice.<br />\nMuch can be learned from the examinations, from failure as well as<br />\nsuccess. The majority of new students during their first half year of<br />\ncollege work more or less in the dark. The midyears have, or should<br />\nhave, cleared up many 'doubtful points.<br />\nThose who have passed all their courses have gained confidence in<br />\nlearning that examinations are not insurmountable obstacles, but for the<br />\nmost part fair tests of one's general knowledge of a course. The students who have failed one or two courses should learn the more useful<br />\nlesson of realizing the seriousness Of college work; and of not looking<br />\nat the absence of daily work, such as that required in preparatory school,<br />\nas an opportunity to loaf through the year. They should learn how to<br />\nstudy, and realize that one week of violent cramming is worth nothing<br />\nin comparison to steady preparation and note-taking throughout the<br />\ncourse.<br />\nA little celebration and relaxation after the strain of the midyear's<br />\nis quite natural and in fact necessary, but the danger lies in over indulgence and allowing class work to slide from week to week. Now is the<br />\ntime to begin to work, for soon the rush of spring activities and an epidemic of spring fever will make study more difficult. All the men who<br />\nremain, from those oil the most ragged edge to those who were the most<br />\nsuccessful, should profit by the lessons learned in the last two weeks,<br />\nand remember that the finals will come just as inevitably as did the midyears.<br /><br />\nJ.<br />\nTHE SPIRIT REMAINS<br />\nWith the lifting of regulations, the \"frosh\" is no longer distinguished<br />\nfrom the presumably wiser upper-classmen. We congratulate them on<br />\ntheir release from the petty burden of cap, button, and the rest. However, it is our earnest hope that the joy of the freshmen in their newfound freedom will limit itself to the usual appalling array of glaring<br />\nsocks and neckties, rather than in the forgetting of the valuable lessons<br />\ntaught by the regulations.<br />\nThe newly emancipated freshman is still on the lowest rung of the<br />\ncollegiate ladder. If he fails to realize this even more than he did during<br />\nthe hectic \"paddle-swinging\" days of the early fall, he has missed the<br />\nspirit and purpose of the regulations. The letter of tine rules has been<br />\nremoved, but the spirit remains. There is no longer a system of game<br />\ntags, but there are still games to be supported; no more yells to be learned,<br />\nbut there are still Hopkins teams to be cheered; no more compulsory<br />\nspeaking on the campus, but the spirit of friendship should still prevail.<br />\nThe basic spirit of the regulations is to make the freshman a better<br />\nHopkins man and the \"frosh\" should \"carry on\" even more willingly, although the regulations have been lifted.<br /><br />\nMYSTERIOUS TRACKS DRAW INTEREST<br />\nOF CAMPUS SHERLOCK HOLMES<br />\nStarting mysteriously in front<br />\nof the main entrance of Gilman<br />\nHall, running down the steps, the<br />\nlength of the quadrangle, over the<br />\nslope, across the bowl and into<br />\nCharles street are two tracks of<br />\nautomobile tires engraved in the<br />\nfast disappearing snow.<br />\nStudents on their way to school<br />\nfor the first day of the second semester last Wednesday were astonished at the peculiar route<br />\ntaken by the wandering motorists.<br />\nMany followed the tracks up to<br />\nwhere they started on the steps<br />\nof Gilman Hall.\u2022 Some looked inquiringly at each other while others winked knowingly.<br />\nCampus sleuths have deduced<br />\nthe fact that the tracks were laid<br />\non Tuesday night, the evening of<br />\nthe last day of the exam period.<br />\nThis fact disclosed a motive for<br />\nthe deed.
