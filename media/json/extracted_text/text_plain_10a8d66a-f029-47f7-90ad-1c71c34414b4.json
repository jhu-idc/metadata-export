Copy:<br />\nDaniel Cole.<br />\n<br />\nFreedom of Choice<br />\nThe long discussion about discrimination last semester terminated with the disappearance of the original<br />\nissue. Phi Gam, rather belatedly, got around to reading<br />\ntheir charter, only to see the issue dissolve before the<br />\nwhites of their eyes. The fact that the Phi Gam chapter<br />\nat Yale has recently accepted a Negro lends credence to<br />\ntheir final interpretation.<br />\nWhile the fraternity issue was before the Student<br />\nCouncil, a question was also raised as to dorm discrimination. The frequency of religious and racial pairings<br />\nwas noted at that time to indicate something more than<br />\njust random pairing. An article in the October 23 NewsLetter by a Council member explained the reason for<br />\nthis. The sole criterion in roommate selection is compatibility. The fact that this results in students of similar race or religion being grouped together is not held to<br />\nobscure this underlying objective.<br />\nWe feel that race or religion or even geographical<br />\nregion should no longer be factors in determining compatibility. It is obvious that they have frequently been<br />\nin the past. The supposition that race and religion in<br />\nparticular are important in relations between Hopkins<br />\nfreshmen, supposedly selected for their intellectual<br />\nabilities, is flagrantly condescending.<br />\nHenceforth all dormitory students should be paired<br />\nwithout consideration of these factors. There is no discernable reason why next year's freshmen can't experience this new policy. Any actual incompatibility that results can be handled individually, after school has started.<br />\nThe dorm administration should, of course, be immensely considerate of any frictions that do arise, but after<br />\nthe fact, not before. It is cynical to treat exceptions as<br />\nthe rule. If the administration feels it is necessary, this<br />\nnew policy might be printed in the Hopkins catalogue.<br />\nEventually, of course, even this notice should be removed.<br />\n<br />\nA Question of Taste<br />\nGeorge Santayana said, \"Spirit is our sense of the<br />\nultimate in the immediate.\"<br />\nOne is spiritual if one can discriminate with sensitivity \u2014 penetration \u2014 style \u2014 wisdom \u2014 between<br />\nthe forms that matter takes, between \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" and Beethoven's Ninth, between Edward<br />\nGuest and T.

The means by which<br />\nthe Gentleman's Code should be<br />\napplied to campus life is a ques-<br />\n<br />\ntion too extensive to be wholly<br />\n<br />\nconsidered here, but if we value<br />\nour tradtion of self-government<br />\n\u2014and this is the heart of the<br />\nmatter\u2014it may be time to recognize the need for some more<br />\nformalized system of review for<br />\nnon-academic behavior. Can this<br />\nbe done with a code that is over<br />\nfifty years old? I think so: the<br />\ndefinition of honor or gentleman<br />\nhas not changed much in the intervening years.

Copy:<br />\nDaniel Cole.<br /><br />\nFreedom of Choice<br />\nThe long discussion about discrimination last semester terminated with the disappearance of the original<br />\nissue. Phi Gam, rather belatedly, got around to reading<br />\ntheir charter, only to see the issue dissolve before the<br />\nwhites of their eyes. The fact that the Phi Gam chapter<br />\nat Yale has recently accepted a Negro lends credence to<br />\ntheir final interpretation.<br />\nWhile the fraternity issue was before the Student<br />\nCouncil, a question was also raised as to dorm discrimination. The frequency of religious and racial pairings<br />\nwas noted at that time to indicate something more than<br />\njust random pairing. An article in the October 23 NewsLetter by a Council member explained the reason for<br />\nthis. The sole criterion in roommate selection is compatibility. The fact that this results in students of similar race or religion being grouped together is not held to<br />\nobscure this underlying objective.<br />\nWe feel that race or religion or even geographical<br />\nregion should no longer be factors in determining compatibility. It is obvious that they have frequently been<br />\nin the past. The supposition that race and religion in<br />\nparticular are important in relations between Hopkins<br />\nfreshmen, supposedly selected for their intellectual<br />\nabilities, is flagrantly condescending.<br />\nHenceforth all dormitory students should be paired<br />\nwithout consideration of these factors. There is no discernable reason why next year's freshmen can't experience this new policy. Any actual incompatibility that results can be handled individually, after school has started.<br />\nThe dorm administration should, of course, be immensely considerate of any frictions that do arise, but after<br />\nthe fact, not before. It is cynical to treat exceptions as<br />\nthe rule. If the administration feels it is necessary, this<br />\nnew policy might be printed in the Hopkins catalogue.<br />\nEventually, of course, even this notice should be removed.<br /><br />\nA Question of Taste<br />\nGeorge Santayana said, \"Spirit is our sense of the<br />\nultimate in the immediate.\"<br />\nOne is spiritual if one can discriminate with sensitivity \u2014 penetration \u2014 style \u2014 wisdom \u2014 between<br />\nthe forms that matter takes, between \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" and Beethoven's Ninth, between Edward<br />\nGuest and T.

D. Long, III<br />\nRoom 2061<br />\nMay 2, 1965<br /><br />\nHonor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nMost, if not all, of the students at Hopkins are acutely<br />\naware of the Honor System<br />\nwhich governs their academic<br />\nconduct; but how aware is the<br />\naverage student of the aspects<br />\nof this system which governs his<br />\nWe<br />\nactivity?<br />\nnon - academic<br />\nmight say for the sake of convenience that the Johns Hopkins Honor System consists of<br />\nthe Honor Code (academic) and<br />\nthe Gentleman's Code (nonacademic).<br />\nUnfortunately, non-academic<br />\noonsiderations must be more subjective that those of an academic nature, and the System's<br />\napplication becomes much more<br />\ndifficult. The means by which<br />\nthe Gentleman's Code should be<br />\napplied to campus life is a ques-<br /><br />\ntion too extensive to be wholly<br /><br />\nconsidered here, but if we value<br />\nour tradtion of self-government<br />\n\u2014and this is the heart of the<br />\nmatter\u2014it may be time to recognize the need for some more<br />\nformalized system of review for<br />\nnon-academic behavior. Can this<br />\nbe done with a code that is over<br />\nfifty years old? I think so: the<br />\ndefinition of honor or gentleman<br />\nhas not changed much in the intervening years. Most observers<br />\nwould agree that Hopkins students are usually gentlemen,<br />\nand we can be proud of this.<br />\nBut are we gentlemen because of<br />\nthe Honor System? Do we accept<br />\nits non-academic application to<br />\nus as we do its academic application? Not as totally as we should,<br />\nI'm afraid. Would the student<br />\nwho turns in a cheater turn in<br />\nsomeone caught stealing books,<br />\ndestroying school property, or<br />\n\"undermining the ethical concept of Hopkins men?\" If each<br />\nstudent took just a few minutes<br />\nto read and study the history<br />\nand philosophy of our Honor<br />\nSystem in the \"Y\" Handpook, we<br />\nwould find many more students<br />\n\"considering themselves privileged to abide by its principles.\"<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nJohn Glascock<br /><br />\nHugh Hefner, editor and publisher of Playboy magazine, was<br />\nfeatured in a YMCA-sponsored<br />\npanel discussion of \"The Playboy<br />\nPhilosophy In America.\" Also<br />\nparticipating in the discussion<br />\nwere Dr. Mary Calderone and Dr.<br />\nWilliam Hamilton.<br />\nThe panelists responded to the<br />\nquestions of Dr. Chester Wickwire, Executive Secretary of the<br />\nHopkins YMCA. Dr. Wickwire<br />\nfirst asked the panelists what the<br />\nso-called sexual revolution in<br />\nAmerica today is. \"Are the sanctions of the past slipping away?<br />\nWe see the increase of disease<br />\nand pregnancy. Also, what is<br />\nmeant when one says sex is<br />\ngood?\"<br />\nDr. Calderone. a mother of<br />\nchildren aged eighteen to forty,<br />\nsaid that \"the sexual revolution<br />\nof yesterday becomes the fixation<br />\nfor rebellion' today.\" She said<br />\nthat the statement that sex is<br />\ngood is meaningless by itself. But<br />\n\"sex is very important, one of<br />\nthe most important aspects of<br />\nman,\" she said. \"Sometimes I<br />\ncall it a sixth sense.\"<br />\nHefner Notes Shift<br />\nHefner remarked that sex is<br />\ngood because we are moving from<br />\na far earlier report of sex as \"a<br />\nnecessary evil.\" \"Today we are<br />\nin a transition state from a Puritan ethic to a far more liberal<br />\nview,\" he stated. \"Sex today is<br /><br />\nExciting<br />\nNew<br />\nDesigns<br /><br />\nThe annual STARLIGHTER<br />\ndance May 15, Gilman quad<br />\n9:00 - 1:00.

Hefner concluded by saying that one aspect<br />\nof today's changing view of sex<br />\nis a tendency to make sex less<br />\nhypocritical.
