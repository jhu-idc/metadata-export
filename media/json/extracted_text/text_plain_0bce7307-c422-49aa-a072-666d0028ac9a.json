Instead, we have<br />\ndevoted much of the paper to covering Spring Fair, the annual carnival and crafts show held at the Homewood campus. If you are one of our regular reader, you are surely<br />\nfamiliar with the fair, hut we hope you still enjoy our expanded coverage of it. If you're a visitor to the campus,<br />\n.we're glad you picked up the News-Letter, and we hope you<br />\ncan learn something new about Hopkins and the fair. Either<br />\nway, for a detailed look at what can be found within the<br />\npaper, see the Table of Contents on page 2.<br />\n<br />\nPull on your poncho, grab<br />\nyour sombrero, and slurp down<br />\na pina colada 'cause Fiesta '86<br />\nis coming your way.<br />\nThe annual Hopkins rite of<br />\nspring which will he kicked off<br />\nat noon today marks the biggest<br />\nweekend on the Hopkins calendar, attracting more than<br />\n100,000 visitors to the<br />\nIlomeNN ood campus for a<br />\nweekend of festivities. \u2022<br />\nAs always, Spring Fair will<br />\nbe a second heaven for shoppers, overflowing with arts and<br />\ncrafts of every possible variety.<br />\nAnd this year, Fair CoChairmen Mark Komisky and<br />\nJim Farina have promised better merchandise than in years<br />\n<br />\npast, thanks to a renewed commitment to attracting only<br />\ncraftsmen of the highest<br />\nquality.<br />\nAt the same time, those who<br />\nprefer to spend their pesos on<br />\ntheir palates will not be at a<br />\nloss. Food of every conceivable<br />\nethnic and domestic variety will<br />\nbe at hand throughout the fair<br />\nto satisfy every taste. Although,<br />\nif you want to buy a beer to<br />\nchase your burrito, you'll be<br />\nconfined to the President's<br />\nGarden, as in years past.<br />\nThis year, the fair will once<br />\nagain lack what was once the<br />\n\"traditional\" fair concert and<br />\nthe 10 K run, but Komisky and<br />\nFarina say they hope that the<br />\n<br />\ncontinuation of the fair games<br />\nlaunched last year for the first<br />\ntime will more than make up<br />\nfor the lost events. Nighttime<br />\nactivities have also been expanded, to beef up the chilly<br />\nevenings.<br />\nAs always, this year's Spring<br />\nFair is completely student<br />\norganized and directed. Hundreds of undergraduates work<br />\nfor several months to plan the<br />\nevent.<br />\nIt is, to say the least, a major undertaking, and one of the<br />\nmost memorable weekends of<br />\nthe year both for Hopkins and<br />\nthe surrounding community.<br />\n<br />\n\f2/APRIL 11, 1986<br />\n<br />\nTable of Contents<br />\nEver wonder how this whole thing got started? Or<br />\nwho's responsible for all those great cars in front of<br />\nHomewood House? Or just what exactly the \"Fair<br />\nGames\" are?<br />\nWell, the answers to all those questions\u2014and to a<br />\ngood many others\u2014can be found right here, in our<br />\nspecial Spring Fair issue.<br />\nSince we've doubled our normal circulation this<br />\nweek and since we're distributing the paper at several<br />\npoints around the fair, we suspect many of you may<br />\nnot know too much about us. Therefore, a brief<br />\nexplanation:<br />\nThe News-Letter is the weekly student newspaper<br />\nat Hopkins. We publish every Friday except during<br />\nfinals and University holidays, and the paper is<br />\ndistributed to four campuses\u2014the Homewood campus at 3400 North Charles St., the East Baltimore campus (where the School of Medicine and the Hospital<br />\nare located), the Peabody Conservatory and Goucher<br />\nCollege in Towson.<br />\nLike the fair, we are a student organization; unlike<br />\nthe fair, we aren't controlled in any way by the University's administration.<br />\nOur offices are located at the south end of the campus (near the Baltimore Museum of Art) in a (to put<br />\nit nicely) picturesque little building called the<br />\nGatehouse.<br />\nWe seek to cover the people and events of Hopkins,<br />\nfocusing most heavily on Homewood. Obviously, the<br />\nFair is more than a minor event for the University,<br />\nand\u2014for that matter\u2014for all of Baltimore.<br />\nSo this year, we've expanded our coverage of the<br />\nfair greatly. A few highlights:<br />\n*If you're wondering how the fair got started, turn<br />\nto page 24. There you'll find an interview with Andy<br />\nSavitz, who founded the fair about 15 years ago as a<br />\nstudent. It was just slightly smaller than it is today\u2014<br />\nthe whole event covered about one-third of<br />\nHomewood's Upper Quad. Nonetheless, the fair grew,<br />\neventually drawing\u2014as it does today--more than<br />\n100,000 people to the campus.<br />\n<br />\nSpring Fair News<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of News and Information<br />\n<br />\n*To be honest, we should mention that in the last<br />\ncouple years, the fair has lost some events (the traditional 10K run, for example), but last year it also gained one: Fair Games. Essentially, the games are a<br />\nchance for students to relax a little, and for everybody<br />\nelse to watch them making fools of themselves. For<br />\ndetails on the six-legged race, the flipper race and the<br />\nMexican Dress-up, see page 11.<br />\n*While most of us see the fair as just a weekend to<br />\nhave a lot of fun, it is, for the organizers, a weekend<br />\nto do a lot of work. They've actually been working,<br />\nfor a lot longer than one weekend; the planning process takes literally months.

The<br />\nfirst and simplest is \"mutually<br />\nassured destruction,\" which involves ensuring that \"an adversary state\" would \"be<br />\ndestroyed as a viable society\"<br />\nin retaliation for any nuclear attack. He said that neither the<br />\nU.S. or the U.S.S.R. has ever<br />\nactually relied on this principle.<br />\nThe second theory involves<br />\nmaking the adversary aware<br />\nthat in the event of an attack,<br />\nthe country will still retain<br />\nenough force to counterattack<br />\nagainst the other side's military<br />\nand render the adversary<br />\n<br />\nin a worse-off position.<br />\nGarwin began his speech by<br />\nsaying that the initial goal of<br />\nthe SDI program as presented<br />\nby President Reagan was that<br />\nof a perfect defense, and<br />\nthat the goal was later revised<br />\nwhen it was found to be<br />\nunfeasible. He said that he<br />\nagreed that some defenses were<br />\nfeasible, but that some are<br />\n\"pernicious\" and some \"we<br />\nalready have without SDI.\"<br />\nHe traced a gradual decline<br />\nin the administration's proposed goals in ballistic defense, and<br />\nquoted Secretary Weinberger as<br />\nsaying \"Our cities will survive<br />\neither by deterrence or by<br />\nforbearance.\"<br />\nHe described<br />\nseveral<br />\ncountermeasures to which he<br />\nsaid the proposed defense<br />\nsystems would be vulnerable.<br />\nOne of these, \"antisimulation,\" was based on the idea<br />\nthat \"if you wanted to protect<br />\nyour' king from assasinaton,<br />\nyou could find twenty beggars<br />\nand dress them up in ermine<br />\nrobes and jewels,\" but it would<br />\nbe more cost effective to dress<br />\nthe king as a beggar. Antisimulation involves protecting<br />\nattacking warheads from defensive systems by making them<br />\nlook like decoys which are also<br />\nlaunched; this is far less expensive than creating decoys which<br />\nresemble warheads and so<br />\nwould allow more decoys to be<br />\nused to confuse a defensive<br />\nsystem.<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/9<br />\n<br />\nActivities Budget for '86-'87<br />\nApproved by SC and SAC<br />\nFrom April 2 to April 7, the<br />\nStudent Activites Commission<br />\nexecutive board allocated<br />\n$139,600 to 47 groups from the<br />\nSAC and the Student Council.<br />\nThe SAC executive board<br />\nmade up of chairman Allen<br />\nRebenstock, Student Council<br />\nPaul Kadri, Director of Student<br />\nActivites Mary Ellen Porter,<br />\nand four students, including<br />\nKathryn Slanski, President of<br />\nthe Band, Rich Pan, Business<br />\nManager of the Course-Guide,<br />\nEd Fee, President of the PreLaw Society, and Scott<br />\nKamber, President of the<br />\nModel United Nations.

The original date<br />\nfor the extravaganza was also<br />\nset on the April 11-13 weekend<br />\nattracting concern from some<br />\ncouncil members and prompting Komisky to say, \"The<br />\ndate puts fair right in the midst<br />\nof a rainy season.\"<br />\nNevertheless, planning of the<br />\nevent continued for the midApril date.<br />\nAfter their selection,<br />\nKomisky and Farina began<br />\nconducting interviews for the<br />\nselection<br />\nof committee<br />\nchairmen. The results of that<br />\nselection process were then announced on November 22.<br />\nSeventeen committees were<br />\nestablished at that time with 30<br />\ncommittee co-chairmen<br />\nIn addition, Brad Handler<br />\nwas chosen to be the assistant<br />\ntreasurer, a new position this<br />\nyear, in order to help Treasurer<br />\nCarolyn Willis. The purpose of<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\nthe new position, according to<br />\nFarina, was to keep the<br />\ntreasurer from having to<br />\n\"count money all day and all<br />\nnight.\"<br />\nAlso, at about the same time<br />\nthe committee chairmen were<br />\nselected, the fair theme was tentatively chosen to be Fiesta at<br />\nthe suggestion of Theme Chairman Donald Jacobson.<br />\nThen on December 4, the<br />\nStudent Cowicil unanimously<br />\npassed a resolution proposed by<br />\nKomisky to push the date of the<br />\nfair to the weekend of May 2-4.<br />\nThe primary reason for the<br />\nmove was to decrease the threat<br />\nof rain or cold weather according to Komisky.<br />\n<br />\nSpring Fair'86<br />\n3400 On Stage<br />\nPlanning<br />\nKomisky said, \"The fair<br />\nbasically hinges on the weather.<br />\nSince Spring Fair is held entirely outdoors, a rainout would<br />\ncause major financial losses.\"<br />\nKomisky also cited the May<br />\ndate as an advantage since it<br />\nwould take place after the<br />\nMCATs permitting more<br />\nstudents to enjoy the fair.<br />\nThe university administration also approved the move according to Komisky's report to<br />\nthe council.<br />\nHowever, during the first<br />\nsemester exam period and over<br />\nChristmas vacation, problems<br />\ndeveloped with the May date<br />\nthat led council to reverse its<br />\ndecision at its first meeting back<br />\nfrom vacation.<br />\nOn a 13-5-0 vote, council<br />\nmoved the fair date back to the<br />\nApril 11-13 weekend at the re-<br />\n<br />\nquest of the Homewood deans.<br />\nAccording to Komisky, the<br />\ndeans received a complaint<br />\nfrom the Mathematics Department which had scheduled a<br />\nconference of international<br />\nmathematicians for May 3 at<br />\nHomewood well over a year<br />\nbeforehand.<br />\n\"The Math Department<br />\noriginally scheduled the conference for the weekend of<br />\nApril 12, but then moved the<br />\ndate to May 3 when informed<br />\nthat it would probably coincide<br />\nwith Spring Fair,\" explained<br />\nKomisky. When the deans were<br />\nconsulted about the change to<br />\nthe May weekend, they evidently forgot about or were<br />\nunaware of the math conference, according to Komisky.<br />\nFollowing the date shuffle,<br />\nfair planning pt\u00b0ceded but was<br />\nmarked with some disappointments.

But<br />\nthere's no way we can predict<br />\nthat it won't be a total wash-out<br />\nbecause of factors we can't<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nKomisky: As far as student<br />\ninvolvement, I'd say...there's<br />\na lot of people who want to be<br />\nin the fair. There are always a<br />\nlot of student groups. We've<br />\nhad, what, 60 people applying<br />\nfor like 16 soda booths. So<br />\nthere's always a lot of people'<br />\nwho want to be in the fair.<br />\nIn some instances, we<br />\nhaven't had as much student<br />\ngroup participation because of<br />\na cut-back in the number of<br />\nbooths.

Hundreds of people.<br />\nThousands of people. You are in the<br />\nmidst, in other words, of Spring Fair.<br />\nThe Fair is, without a doubt, Hopkins'<br />\nbiggest event of the year. During the<br />\nweekend, more than 100,000 people<br />\ncram onto the campus to buy things, eat<br />\nthings, look at things and drink things.<br />\nYou are probably one of them. If you<br />\nare, welcome to Hopkins.(If you're one<br />\nof our regular readers, we're glad you<br />\nPicked up the paper too, although this<br />\nweekend we, along with the rest of the<br />\nUniversity, are mostly interested in showing off for the rest of Baltimore.)<br />\nElsewhere in this newspaper, you can<br />\nread about how the Fair is planned, but<br />\nlet us here add a few between-the-lines<br />\ncomments. The Fair is largely organized by students, although key decisions<br />\nare generally made by the administration. Still, the idea was developed by<br />\nundergraduates about 15 years ago, and<br />\nit is still essentially their show.<br />\nOne change in the Fair this year,<br />\ndeserves special notice. Simply put:<br />\nThere will be less junk for sale. In the<br />\npast, as experienced Fair-goers will surely<br />\nremember, there were tables and tables<br />\nand tables and ta... well, you get the<br />\n<br />\nidea, of jewelry. Cheap jewelry. Very<br />\ncheap jewelry. Most of it wasn't made<br />\nby the people selling it, and the whole<br />\nthing made the Fair look rather like a<br />\nflea market.<br />\nThis year's organizers have intentionally clamped down on such people,<br />\nemphasizing that crafts vendors for this<br />\nyear's Fair must actually have made the<br />\nstuff themselves. That means there are<br />\nfewer folks selling their wares, but we'll<br />\ntake quality over quantity any day.<br />\nStill, the Fair is a chance for<br />\nBaltimoreans to see Hopkins\u2014an interaction that takes place far too infrequently. As sad as it is to say it, there<br />\noften seems to be some sort of hostility<br />\nbetween community leaders and the<br />\nUniversity. We've discussed this fact<br />\nbefore (in connection with last fall's<br />\nWyman Park controversy), but it's<br />\nworthwhile to mention again that there<br />\nreally isn't much of a reason for animosity. Perhaps the Fair\u2014by presenting the<br />\nbetter side of Hopkins\u2014can quell some<br />\nof those feelings.<br />\nSo while you're enjoying all those<br />\ntacos and egg rolls and chicken legs, enjoy the campus in general. It's the one<br />\ntime all year we at Hopkins get to share<br />\nit with a good chunk of Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\nHOP Suspension:<br />\n<br />\nIt Was a Mistake<br />\nThere appear to be some very<br />\ninaccurate and misinformed<br />\nideas about the HOP and its<br />\nproblems with the alcohol<br />\npolicy. I will try to set the<br />\nrecord straight.<br />\nFirst of all the editorial that<br />\nappeared in last week's NewsLetter, \"Spanking the HOP,\"<br />\n<br />\nandrew chun<br />\n<br />\nwas supported by erroneous information. Mary Ellen Porter<br />\nand Andrea Perry do not sit on<br />\nthe HOP executive board. They<br />\nhave been replaced by Jane<br />\nGentil, the Union Coordinator,<br />\nand Tracey Lyons, the Program<br />\nDirector of Residential Life.<br />\nThe reason why the change was<br />\naffected was to keep the HOP<br />\nas a purely programming entity not an administrative one.<br />\nThe major reason that Porter<br />\nand Perry sat on the HOP<br />\nboard was that they used to<br />\nhandle the programming in<br />\ntheir respective departments.<br />\nThe HOP is devinitely not an<br />\nadministrative \"creature\" at<br />\nall. Perhaps the Alcohol Policy<br />\nitself is an administrative<br />\nanimal. In any case the two<br />\nshould not be confused. the<br />\nHOP does enforce the policy,<br />\nhowever, it is not open to<br />\ndebate or modification by the<br />\nexecutive board.<br />\nThe only part of the editor's<br />\nanalysis of the HOP situation<br />\nthat was accurate was the point<br />\nthat suspending the HOP was,<br />\n\"far different than suspending<br />\na frat.\" Unfortunately, his further analysis of the problem<br />\nwas not very insightful. The effect of a suspension on the<br />\nHaving sounded sufficiently like the receive. (Its signal is very weak.) This HOP was to give us a month's<br />\nvacation from running everyhouse organ for the Hopkins booster spring...er, summer... uh, fall...well, one's<br />\nalcohol events. I seriousclub, we should also mention that the sometime before hell freezes over ly doubt that when we resume<br />\nUniversity does have some problems. (maybe), the station is scheduled to serving alcohol at school events<br />\nWe've pointed them out before, but, as undergo a major power increase and (i.e. Spring Fair), that our atmentioned above, many of you are pro- become professionally managed. We tendance or image will be<br />\nbably reading our columns for the first stammer so on the date because original- changed drastically. However,<br />\nwhen a fraternity is suspended<br />\ntime. So to avoid presenting too candy- ly the larger station was supposed to be from alcoholic social activities<br />\n<br />\n...and the Bad<br />\n<br />\ncoated an image of the place, a quick<br />\nreview of some of Hopkins' trials and<br />\ntribulations:<br />\n*Almost since the beginning of the<br />\nacademic year, the University has come<br />\nunder heavy pressure from some students<br />\nto divest itself of stocks of corporations<br />\nwhich do business in South Africa. The<br />\nactive proponents of divestment\u2014a<br />\nrelatively large group by Hopkins standards but still a decided minority of the<br />\nstudent body\u2014have staged protests at<br />\nBoard of Trustees meetings and recently even held a sit-in in the administration's main building.<br />\nWhile the pro-divestment people have<br />\noccasionally over-stated their case, they<br />\nare correct in saying that universities<br />\nought to hold themselves up to a higher<br />\nmoral standard\u2014a standard that simply can't accomodate investing in companies which are intertwined in apartheid. The University ought to divest.<br />\n*There are serious problems with the<br />\nadministration, which just goofs up a lot<br />\nof the time. As an example, take the case<br />\nof WJHU,the University's radio station,<br />\nwhich most of you probably cannot<br />\n<br />\nup and running about a year-and-a-half<br />\nago. The delays have been so frequent,<br />\nthe foul-ups so common, that the whole<br />\naffair has become almost a parody of<br />\nhow bad the administration can get.<br />\nOr another example: This fall it came<br />\nto light that the university had placed<br />\ntelephones in every dorm room without<br />\nknowing\u2014as nearly as we can tell\u2014<br />\nprecisely what rates the students using<br />\nthe phones would be charged. At the<br />\ntime, the administration said it was<br />\n\"satisfied\" with its phone service. We're<br />\nnot satisfied with the administration.<br />\n*Students at Hopkins have a tendency to live up to their egg-headish image,<br />\nrarely becoming interested in much<br />\nbeyond their studies. Nobody has quite<br />\nfigured out how you combat that, so too<br />\nmany students remain buried in the<br />\nlibrary, intent only upon getting into med<br />\nschool.<br />\nThere are, to be sure, other problems<br />\nat Hopkins; we've listed only a few. So<br />\nwhile you're enjoying the better side of<br />\nthe University this weekend\u2014Spring<br />\nFair\u2014remember also that we have our<br />\nproblems, and we know it.<br />\n<br />\nit hurts them directly. The<br />\nsocial life of the brothers, the<br />\nimage of the frat, and the effective rushing of prospective<br />\npledges are all affected. The net<br />\nresults of the administration's<br />\ndecision to suspend the HOP<br />\nwere:<br />\n1) student groups were to<br />\n<br />\ncancel or suffer sever financial<br />\nlosses on their events, and<br />\n2) the entire school was<br />\ndenied any social programming<br />\nwith alcohol. The suspension<br />\nhurt the students the most, not<br />\nthe HOP. How can this be considered in the words of the<br />\neditor \"refreshing,\" \"heartening,\" \"pleasant,\" and \"fair\"?<br />\nThe final point I'd like to<br />\nmake is that the alcohol violations were a result of some<br />\nmisunderstandings about the<br />\npresent policy and the carryingover of practices which had<br />\nbeen in effect for social events<br />\nfor at least the past two years.<br />\nThere were no problems with<br />\nthe major points of the policy<br />\nsuch as checking ID's or serving people with wrist bands.<br />\nThe bulk of the confusion came<br />\nup over more specific items (1<br />\nor 2 ID's, number of beers per<br />\nperson, etc.).<br />\nVery simply, after the<br />\nmisunderstandings with the<br />\nalcohol policy had been<br />\nstraightened out, the HOP<br />\nshould have been allowed to go<br />\non serving the campus. There<br />\nwas no intent to purposely<br />\nviolate the policy even in the<br />\neyes of the administration. In<br />\nmy view, a suspension was<br />\nharmful, not helpful, in this<br />\ninstance.<br />\nIf there are more opinions to<br />\nbe heard about the HOP or its<br />\nactivities, I hope that they will<br />\nbe educated ones.<br />\n<br />\nThe writer is the director of the<br />\nHOP.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins News.Letter<br />\nEditor<br />\nEthan Rarick<br />\nBusiness Manager<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nMary Ginder<br />\nProduction Manager<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nTimothy McNamara, A.J.

The<br />\n<br />\nbatteries.<br />\nSeveral months ago each<br />\nmember of the Senior class<br />\nreceived a ballot form asking<br />\nthem to vote for their choice for<br />\n<br />\njoel greenwald<br />\nspeaker selected this year is the<br />\nmuch ballyhooed oceanographer Roger Revelle. Gee, I'd better tell friends and relatives to<br />\nget here early in order to get a<br />\nseat. After all, Senior Class<br />\nPresident Paul Donio said<br />\nRevelle is \"not a famous person, but his appeal is wide.\"<br />\nAn oceanographer with a wide<br />\nappeal?! Yeah, sure, maybe<br />\namongst mollusks and crustaceans. I believe that students<br />\nwant a well known commencement speaker, and truthfully I<br />\ndo not agree with Paul Donio's<br />\ncomment that Revelle will<br />\n\"relate to the people here.\"<br />\nworse. Sea<br />\ngets<br />\nIt<br />\nhas callmagazine<br />\nTechnology<br />\ned Revelle \"one of the two or<br />\narticulate<br />\nmost<br />\nthree<br />\nspokesmen for science in the<br />\nworld.\" My subscription to Sea<br />\nTechnology expired last month,<br />\nso I can't validate this. Articulate? You'd better believe it.<br />\nRevelle's pearls include<br />\n\"Oceanographers are just<br />\nsailors who use big words,\"<br />\nand \"Oceanography is fun.\"<br />\nOceanography might be \"fun\"<br />\nat Gilligan's Island, but not at<br />\ngraduation.<br />\nThe article in last week's<br />\nNews-Letter concluded that the<br />\nexact subject of the commencement address has not yet been<br />\ndetermined. Don't worry, it<br />\nshouldn't be boring. The article said that his research includes 'Studies of the Ecological Effects of Atomic Devices<br />\nand Studies of the Geology of<br />\nthe Sea Floor in the Pacific.'<br />\nCome graduation day, I hope<br />\nmy Walkman has fresh<br />\n<br />\nthe speaker. The names I saw<br />\nincluded Peter Ueberroth,<br />\nGeraldine Ferraro, and Walter<br />\nCronkite. Hmm,seems funny,<br />\nI don't recall Roger Revelle's<br />\nname on my questionnaire.<br />\nWith the names that we were<br />\ngiven to choose from, I figured<br />\nthat the committee seemed on<br />\nthe right track.

Did someone<br />\nsay Tom Carvel? No, the reality is that although Revelle<br />\nmight be a fine speaker, there<br />\nare many fine speakers here on<br />\ncampus.

(For its own<br />\nreasons, the News-Letter only<br />\nnoted me as the author.)<br />\n1) Gatsha Buthelezi is described by Wolford as being<br />\n\"faithful to the strategy of nonviolent resistance.\" While this<br />\nmight be Buthelezi's view<br />\ntowards the racist South African<br />\ngovernment, it is very well<br />\ndocumented that in just the last<br />\nyear, his lnkatha organization<br />\nhas killed dozens of United<br />\nDemocratic Front activists, socalled Indians in Durban, and<br />\nmembers of the Ponda tribe.<br />\nBeing nonviolent to the apartheid police state and nonviolent to one's own people is<br />\nrather telling. Incidentally, Inkatha kills most of its victims<br />\nwith spears and other tribal<br />\nweapons; our adjective \"spearthrowing\" was thus descriptive<br />\nand racist. \"Tribalistic\" is used by many black South<br />\nAfricans to describe Inkatha.<br />\nWolford singles me (a white)<br />\nout for criticism on use of<br />\nwords while ignoring my coauthor Nkone, a black South<br />\nAfrican. We are both quite<br />\naware of subtleties of language.<br />\n2) Wolford suggests that Inkatha is not a group limited to<br />\nthe Zulu tribe but includes<br />\nother South African blacks. We<br />\nsuggest that the Inkatha's Zulu<br />\nmembership exceeds 99 percent<br />\nof the group; Inkatha is nearly<br />\nalways described as a Zulu<br />\norganization and Buthelezi as<br />\n<br />\nIntroducing the lower cost of higher education.<br />\n,<br />\n'Ciiiiiii1111111111111111111 .iiiiii0111! 111111<br />\nLustritilln.<br />\n<br />\nthe leader of the Zulus. No<br />\nanti-apartheid leader in South<br />\nAfrica accepts such tribal<br />\nlabels. While Buthelezi is<br />\nrhetorically skilled in decrying<br />\napartheid and tribalism, the<br />\nreality remains and is reflected<br />\nin descriptions used not just by<br />\nmyself and Nkone, but by the<br />\nworld press as well.<br />\n3) Regarding ties to the<br />\nBotha government, the difference between the employers<br />\nof Rev. Alan Boesak (University of the Western Cape) and<br />\nButhelezi(Department of Bantu Administration) should be<br />\nclear. Boesak's role in having<br />\nthe World Council of Reformed Churches, of which he was<br />\nrecently the President, label<br />\napartheid a \"heresy\" absolves<br />\nhim of the guilt by association<br />\n(i.e., that the Reformed Church<br />\nin South Africa is racially divided) that Wolford heaps upon<br />\nhim. By the nature of the apartheid system, there are only a<br />\nminute number of multi-racial<br />\nchurches in South Africa;<br />\nBoesak must operate within this<br />\nstructure. Buthelezi, on the<br />\nother hand, operates within the<br />\nhomeland structure\u2014he is the<br />\nde facto ruler of the<br />\nZululands\u2014which has often<br />\nbeen condemned as apartheid's<br />\nmost blatant affront to the<br />\ndignity of black South<br />\nAfricans.<br />\n4) Wolford uses the obscure<br />\nSouth African Indian Academy<br />\nto again attempt to legitimize<br />\nButhelezi. There are certainly<br />\n<br />\nso-called Indians who play a<br />\nrole similar to Buthelezi\u2014<br />\ncollaborating in the oppression<br />\nof millions of Africans for their<br />\nown personal gain. Indeed,<br />\nthere is an Indian third<br />\nchamber in the South African<br />\nParliament, whose members<br />\nwealthy<br />\nare<br />\ngenerally<br />\nbusinesspeople with no real<br />\npower or proven desire to fundamentally change the system.<br />\nIn view of Pretoria's attempt to<br />\nuse such people, the United<br />\nDemocratic Front persuaded 89<br />\npercent of the Indian people to<br />\nboycott the recent Parliamentary elections. But just last<br />\nweek, the Indian Members of<br />\nParliament\u2014generally called<br />\n\"sell-outs\" and \"stooges\" by<br />\nactivists in South Africa\u2014<br />\nbegan discussing a powersharing arrangement in Natal<br />\nProvince with Buthelezi and a<br />\nfew white liberals.

As a<br />\nformer student leader on the<br />\ncampus, 1 object to Chen's<br />\ndescription of the Student<br />\nCouncil as an ineffectual<br />\n<br />\n\"home of nepotism on a grand<br />\nscale.\" As a member of last<br />\nyear's council, I saw many<br />\nvaluable programs begin\u2014such<br />\nas the faculty-student interaction fund, the quad-monitors,<br />\nthe security phones, the HOP,<br />\nthe Rotunda shuttle, the airport<br />\nshuttle, as well as other<br />\nprograms\u2014which Chen sees as<br />\nnot significantly improving the<br />\nlife of student. It is true that<br />\nthere have been problems in<br />\nthis year's council (due, in my<br />\nopinion, to the amount of<br />\npolitical types of issues they<br />\nhave been forced to deal with),<br />\nbut this is no reason to<br />\nreorganize the entire system of<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nChen, it seems to me that you<br />\ndon't understand that the council is not (and shouldn't be) a<br />\nbody with the power to instantly change University policy\u2014<br />\nnor does it have unlimited<br />\nfunds to work with. The council, through the work on its<br />\ncommittees and Executive<br />\nBoard, does recommend action<br />\nto the administration; and<br />\nalthough Student Activities<br />\nfunding has been a question of<br />\nthe council's, the council does<br />\nits best to distribute funds (as<br />\nit sees fit) to implement programs for the student body's<br />\nbenefit. You act as if the council members of last and this<br />\nyear care nothing about the<br />\nWJHU and Hut issues. Last<br />\nyear's council addressed both<br />\nissues, and using the proper<br />\nchannels of the university attempted to act on them. This<br />\n\"board with no executive<br />\npowers\" you are suggesting<br />\nwould surely fail without the<br />\nsupport of the university administration.<br />\nAs far as the point of your<br />\n\"cursory look\" at the Young<br />\n<br />\nTrustee statements, speaking as<br />\none who had a statement in that<br />\nbatch-1 object to your referring to the candidates as being<br />\npeople with a \"long history of<br />\nincompetence\" who promote<br />\nan \"unhealthy degree of<br />\nhomogeneity.\" I, and the other<br />\ntrustee candidates, worked hard<br />\nfor (and in) the positions we<br />\nhad. If we got many positions,<br />\nit was because people like you<br />\nelected us, or a qualified group<br />\nsuch as the Committee on<br />\nCommittees chose us. It is by<br />\nusing qualified and proven people (with a healthy influx of<br />\n\"new blood\") for committee<br />\nchairs, that one can make committees stronger. Is it my fault<br />\nthat others have not served on<br />\ncomittees while I have served<br />\non more than one? No! In fact,<br />\nit shows my (and others) interest in the University community; that I would give many<br />\nhours of my time and hard<br />\n<br />\nwork to improve life at<br />\nHopkins. I am not asking for a<br />\npat on the back from you, Joe,<br />\nI got plenty back out of my<br />\nactivities\u2014but only because I<br />\nput a great deal into it. If your<br />\nare not pleased with the people<br />\nholding positions because of the<br />\njob they are doing, you should<br />\nfeel free to voice your grievance<br />\nto the council. That is the use<br />\nof democracy. Limiting the<br />\nnumber of times a person can<br />\nserve on your \"board\" shows<br />\na \"slight\" descrepancy in your<br />\nview of democracy.<br />\nNo Joe, I think you should<br />\nstop believing that the student<br />\ncouncil should be some<br />\n\"revolutionary\" body which<br />\nassumes absolute control over<br />\nthe workings of the university<br />\nand start thinking about what<br />\ncommittee you have some suggestions for\u2014the council<br />\nmeeting is on Wednesday night.<br />\nIn fact, what surprises me Joe,<br />\n<br />\ntime and again in independent<br />\npolls blacks have said that they<br />\nknow they will have to undergo<br />\nfurther hardship because of<br />\neconomic sanctions, but that<br />\nthey are prepared to do so.<br />\nOther individuals on campus<br />\nmay find themselves saying well<br />\nand good to these discussions<br />\nbut asking how Hopkins fits into such issues of international<br />\nscope. Why get involved? Why<br />\ntake any financial risk on a<br />\nmoral issue? The answer is that<br />\nthis issue is unusual of its kind,<br />\nfirstly, because we are virtually unanimous on the evil that is<br />\ninvolved in grand apartheid<br />\nand, secondly, we have that<br />\nrare opportunity of actually<br />\nhaving a genuine impact on a<br />\nsituation. This movement to<br />\ndivest has wide support, a<br />\nsidely-recognized and credible<br />\nrationale, and it is affecting<br />\ncorporations and governments.<br />\nAs a university we should not<br />\nexpend our moral capital<br />\ncasually,and this is not casual.<br />\nIt is worth using our moral<br />\nclout to worry the corporations,<br />\nto worry the South African<br />\ngovernment and to inspire<br />\nother institutions to follow suit.<br />\nWe can do all of this, as<br />\n<br />\nwe've argued, with little financial risk to ourselves. A phased<br />\ndivestment where stock is sold<br />\nat advantageous points and<br />\nwhere we purchase a core of<br />\nSouth Africa-free solid bluechip stocks (of which there are<br />\ndozens\u2014surprise, there is life<br />\nafter IBM!), could well result in<br />\nHopkins making a profit, as no<br />\nless than Mr. Riggs-Griffith,<br />\nour treasurer, has admitted.<br />\nThinking ideologicaly once<br />\nagain, they think we should only fault our \"strategic enemies\"<br />\nand never utter a word against<br />\nour \"strategic friends.\" It must<br />\nnever transpire, however, that<br />\nwe become so closely bound to<br />\ncorporate interests that we lose<br />\nour willingness to speak out<br />\nmeaningfully against an evil as<br />\nhuge as apartheid. To the opponents of divestment we ask<br />\nthat you confront the facts (the<br />\nviolence, the polls, the financial<br />\n, studies), try to extend your<br />\nsympathy for human suffering<br />\nmore even-handedly, and try<br />\nexpanding your generosity<br />\nbeyond your immediate community.

Andy Savitz, '75,<br />\norganizer and chairman of the<br />\nfirst Spring Fair, explained how<br />\nthey first undertook this major<br />\nevent.<br />\nWhen Savitz first came to<br />\n<br />\nSpring Fair'86<br />\n3400 On Stage<br />\nHistory<br />\nHopkins,\"...they were kicking the idea around to do<br />\nsomething that would bring the<br />\ncommunity to campus,\" he<br />\nsaid; \"The original intention<br />\nwas not to make money; we<br />\nthought we'd actually lose<br />\nmoney on it.\" He said that no<br />\none was quite sure how the first<br />\nfair would turn out. \"We had<br />\nterrific support from Muller<br />\nand the administration, but<br />\nthere were many uncertainties,\" he said. For starters,<br />\n\"there was at that time a great<br />\nconcern for the physical appearance of the campus,\" said<br />\nSavitz. In addition, he said that<br />\nthe Baltimore City Fair was just<br />\ngetting off the ground at that<br />\ntime, and there was the question of duplication,<br />\nHowever, as Savitz said,<br />\n\"We ran with it. People came<br />\nto the fair, and the next morning the Student Council and the<br />\nfrats were out there picking gar-<br />\n<br />\na circus one year out on the soccer field ...it still wasn't nearly the size it is now,\" he said.<br />\nBy 1975, he said that the fair<br />\ndrew about 100,000 people. In<br />\naddition, Savitz said that the<br />\nfairs were always held on<br />\nweekends of home lacrosse<br />\ngames. \"It was nice, because all<br />\nthe people from the community were,out at the fair, and all<br />\nthe Hopkins people were at the<br />\nlax game...it was like a fair<br />\nwithin a fair,\" he said.<br />\nUntil recent years, beer consumption was not restricted to<br />\na beer garden. However, \"Alcohol was not a big part of the<br />\nfair; it was a community<br />\nevent,\" said Savitz. He said the<br />\nfair was and is great for<br />\nHopkins because \"it gives peopie a chance to do their own<br />\nthing.\" There was a lot of support and participation from.<br />\neveryone, from the frats to the<br />\nadministration. \"The frats used to put up all the snow fencing for us,\" he said.<br />\nSavitz deserves credit for<br />\nstarting Hopkins off on one terrific tradition. However, he insists that it was no one person's<br />\nidea. \"I just structured itl<br />\nsimilar to a fair that had been<br />\nheld at my high school.\" Savitz<br />\nsaid, \"It was everyone's<br />\nidea...an organic thing that<br />\njust grew very quickly.\"<br />\nSavitz was at first impressed<br />\nthat even the Hut is now ternporarily closed because of<br />\nSpring Fair, but then recalled a<br />\nreception that was held there<br />\nduring the first fair. He said, \"I<br />\nwas in this barbershop quartet,<br />\nand we went into the Hut and<br />\nstarted singing, but some peoplc kept right on studying.\"<br />\n<br />\nAuto<br />\nShow<br />\nWill Be<br />\nAt Fair<br />\nSPRING<br />\n<br />\nFAIR!!<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of News and Information<br />\n<br />\nFood For Thought;<br />\nVendor Recalls Fairs Past<br />\nby Jay Lechintan<br />\n. .. Walking all day, riding<br />\nrides, dodging crowds\u2014it can<br />\ntake a lot out of a Spring<br />\nFairgoer. So what does one<br />\nthink of\u2014Food, right? Well<br />\nthat's exactly what Dave Watson, Hopkins '50, has been<br />\nthinking about every spring<br />\nsince 1972.<br />\nWatson organizes some of<br />\nthe major food booths for the<br />\nSpring Fair\u2014the Senior Class<br />\nRoast Beef Booth, and booths<br />\nthat sell Italian sausages and<br />\nhot dogs.<br />\n\"The fair started off very<br />\nmodestly\u2014it rained the first<br />\nyear, and no one wanted to<br />\ncome back\u2014they had to beg us<br />\n[the vendors] to come back the<br />\nnext year; no fees, etc.\"<br />\nThe fair grew, \"each one an<br />\nimprovement on the one<br />\nbefore,\" according to Watson,<br />\nuntil a few years ago. \"It was<br />\nbetter attended in the past.\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nWatson didn't want to say<br />\nthat the fair was better in the<br />\npast, but \"it used to last much<br />\nlonger in hours. Moneywise,<br />\nit's definitely gone down,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n<br />\nbage up off the quads.. . by<br />\nMonday it was as good as<br />\nnew.\"<br />\nThe first fair was certainly<br />\nvery small in comparison.\"We<br />\nhad a budget of $3000. . .and<br />\nthat was for everything,\" said<br />\nSavitz, \"and it covered only<br />\nabout one-third of Gilman<br />\nquad.\" One event, a small rock<br />\nconcert, was held out on the<br />\nfreshman quad. \"We also had<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of News and Informatfo.n<br />\n<br />\nAbove: A vendor sells her goods. Below: Both ,oung and old alike enjov the fair.<br />\n<br />\nIn Watson's view, one of the<br />\nmajor problems in recent years<br />\nwith the fair has been the new<br />\ndrinking regulations. \"The 18<br />\nyear-old drinking [prohibition]<br />\nhas definitely ruined the fair,\"<br />\nWatson said. \"In the past, you<br />\ncould get a sandwich, a soda,<br />\nand a beer all at one booth.<br />\nNow, you have to go to one<br />\nbooth for a sandwich, another<br />\nfor a soda, and all the way to<br />\nthe Beer Garden for a beer\u2014<br />\n<br />\nHey, what's that out on the<br />\nbeach?!

Library. Ed<br />\nWindfelder, director of the Car<br />\nShow, said that the Space Car<br />\n\"looks like something out of<br />\nStar Wars.\" However, there<br />\nwill also be plenty of antiques<br />\nas well. And, \"although the<br />\ntrend in car collecting has<br />\nalways been towards 50s and<br />\n60s automobiles, we have made<br />\na concerted effort to get cars<br />\nfrom the Classic Era, like a<br />\n1930 Rolls Royce,\" said Windfelder. Past shows have includ-<br />\n<br />\nSpring Fair'86<br />\n3400 On Stage<br />\n<br />\nPeople<br />\n<br />\nthe Beer Garden has not helped<br />\nthe fair at all.\"<br />\nAccording to Watson, the<br />\ndrinking age in Maryland \"had<br />\nalways been 21\u2014until about 8<br />\nyears ago.\" It was expected that<br />\nstudents would drink at university events, Watson remarked.<br />\n\"It's not the fair's fault,<br />\nthough,\" Watson countered,<br />\n\"It's the times that are.\"<br />\nCompared to other fairs<br />\nWatson has been involved with,<br />\nsuch as Baltimore's City Fair,<br />\nHopkins' Spring Fair has had<br />\n\"a much nicer clientele,\" he<br />\nremarked, \"but now its very<br />\nbusy\u2014people aren't as polite.\"<br />\nIn terms of profits, Watson<br />\nadded, he's glad that the fair is<br />\nso popular, but he noted \"It's<br />\nbigness is most of its<br />\nproblem\u2014it's lost that nice<br />\nuniversity feeling, where people<br />\nwould not push and shove to<br />\nget a hot dog. They would<br />\nsmile, and say excuse me, and<br />\nlet other people in first.

At any<br />\nrate, the bulk of his book is<br />\ndevoted to showing his various<br />\nexperiences as they are connected to his various friends.<br />\nThus, one finds one chapter<br />\ndevoted to such famous Drury<br />\nLane actors as Sybil Thorndike,<br />\n\u2022Ernest Milton, and Martita<br />\nHunt. He goes on at great<br />\nlength about Sir Ralph<br />\nRichardson, and there is a very<br />\neffusive chapter revolving<br />\naround Sir John Gielgud. His<br />\npresentation of non-actor<br />\nfriends and acquaintances, such<br />\nas Dame Edith Sitwell and Noel<br />\nCoward, are fresh and interesting in that they are seen<br />\nthrough the filter of someone<br />\nelse's experience. These are not,<br />\nhowever, tell-all exposesin the<br />\nMommy Dearest tradition.<br />\nThe private failings and faults<br />\nof Guiness' friends remain<br />\nprivate. Guiness attempts to<br />\navoid those stories which<br />\nalways build up between<br />\nfriends, but which interest no<br />\none but the parties involved.<br />\nThis is especially important in<br />\nGuiness' situation, i.e., almost<br />\n<br />\nall the people about whom he<br />\nis writing are dead, leaving only the author himself to vouch<br />\nfor the accuracy of his memory.<br />\nOverlying these episodic<br />\nchapters are subjects presented,<br />\nas the continuing themes of<br />\nGuiness' life: acting, religion,<br />\nand his marriage. The first is<br />\nprimarily concerned with parts<br />\ngotten, parts not gotten, stories<br />\nabout actor/director disagreements, with a few words<br />\nthrown in about theater-in-the<br />\nround. The second deals with<br />\nGuiness' crises of belief and his<br />\neventual reception into the<br />\nRoman Catholic Church. And<br />\nwhile this might be categorized<br />\nas actors' dramatics or the attempt by a practitioner of a<br />\nshallow profession to create the<br />\nillusion of depth, his reading<br />\nlist (Hooker, Bishop Gore, St.<br />\nThomas More) was substantial<br />\nenough. Finally, Guiness admits great devotion to and concern for his wife, although on<br />\nthe whole, he does not say as<br />\nmuch about her specifically as<br />\nhe does about the strength he<br />\nderived from their relationship.<br />\nAs with any work of this<br />\nsort, there is bound to be some<br />\n'material which the author<br />\ndecides is inclispensible, but.<br />\nwhich the reader finds to be of<br />\nmarginal interest. A good work<br />\nis thus distinguished from a bad<br />\none by the quantity of marginal<br />\nmaterial. Blessings is not free<br />\nfrom such stuff: Guiness goes<br />\non at great length about his service in the Navy and about his<br />\nstate of mind upon growing<br />\n<br />\nlittsSRCS<br />\nR DISCHISI<br />\nold. While each of these subjects might attract some interest, they are not as compelling as accounts of lunch with<br />\nGeorge Bernard Shaw or drinks<br />\nwith Ernest Hemingway.<br />\nIn writing one's life story it<br />\nhelps to have had an interesting<br />\nlife (although to judge from<br />\n<br />\nsome recent books it does not<br />\nseem to be an absolute necessity). Alec Guiness certainly<br />\nqualifies on this criterion and it<br />\nis more to his credit that he was<br />\nable to communicate not only<br />\nthe events but also his reactions<br />\nto them.<br />\n<br />\n\"A Searing, Indelible Vision of Our World\"<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n41040440000i<br />\nRobert Stone's Children of<br />\nChildren of Light<br />\nis fiction with a hard<br />\nLight<br />\nby Robert Stone.<br />\nBurnt-out coked-up<br />\nedge.<br />\nAlfred A.

Understatement<br />\nserves to prevent the novel's<br />\noverwhelming neurosis from<br />\nbecoming ridiculous.<br />\nThe novel explores' modern<br />\ndisillusionment and the dual<br />\ntheme of self-alienation and<br />\nmasquerade.

Children could have<br />\ngotten out of hand and cliched<br />\nif the emotionless children,<br />\nHollywood jet set, and<br />\nenlightened eccentrics were examined too closely. Fortunately, the supporting cast is driven<br />\nby almost incomprehensible but<br />\nbelievable craziness.

He<br />\nblurts out \"condom\" when he<br />\nmeans \"conundrum\" and<br />\nnever forgives himself. He<br />\nrelives his embarrassments and<br />\nhates Walker for some forgot-<br />\n<br />\nten humiliation.<br />\nThe identity crisis is<br />\npresented with equal skill and<br />\nLee's occasional slips into or<br />\nout of herself are the only<br />\ndanger to the novel's credibility. She believes in mystical apparitions she calls the \"Long<br />\nFriends.\" In some cases, they<br />\nthreaten to unravel the structure in a chain reaction. If she<br />\nbecomes unreal or a parody of<br />\nherself, then everything else just<br />\nmight follow into abstract selfpity.<br />\nBut the novel's power is in its<br />\nability to remain cool. While<br />\nthe characters may wallow in<br />\ntheir problems, the writing does<br />\nnot. In today's self-aware struggle to stay individual, this<br />\nwriting makes the sacrifice of<br />\nnot becoming too involved with<br />\nitself. People cannot function<br />\nin emotional vacuums, but<br />\nwriting can sometimes do with<br />\ncareful control of its narrative.<br />\nIn this case, some readers may<br />\nfind Walker and Verger so<br />\nprecisely depicted as to<br />\ndiscourage sympathy. But they<br />\ndon't really care about<br />\nanybody's sympathy and the<br />\nending dispels any notion that<br />\nthe novel is purely a slick account of a torrid affair.<br />\nSo an entertaining, calm<br />\nglance at our generation is the<br />\nresult.

Of the hundred or so<br />\nbright spots, the brightest was<br />\nthe return of co-captain Del<br />\nDressel. Inspired by a midweek<br />\nprivate pep talk from Zimmerman, Dressel thoroughly controlled the midfield, notched<br />\nfour goals and 2 assists, and<br />\nplayed perhaps his most<br />\nawesome game ever.<br />\n\"Del was a man,\" said the<br />\ncoach, \"I've never seen him<br />\ndominate like he did today.\"<br />\nWhen Dressel, Craig Bubier,<br />\nand Brian Wood are all hot on<br />\nthe same day, no defense the<br />\nworld can stop them, and that's<br />\nexactly what happened against<br />\nCarolina. Bubier scored four<br />\ngoals, all within a 6 minute<br />\nspan, to give him a team high<br />\nof 17 for the year. Wood had<br />\na goal and four assists, but stats<br />\nalone don't show how well he<br />\nplayed. Constantly hounded by<br />\ndefenses designed to neutralize<br />\nhis scoring, Wood has seen his<br />\ngoal output go down this year<br />\nbut has become a truly complete player. He leads the Jays<br />\nwith 17 assists and has become<br />\nmaybe the best attackman at<br />\npreventing clears around.<br />\n<br />\nzzvw*.04\"...voltimewiorovistailtsitii\u2022<br />\nVraFINVA.V..-7,1 - voititi<br />\ntinwi<br />\na<br />\n::<br />\n4<br />\n\u2018::<br />\n40.<br />\n\u201e ;;<br />\n:!<br />\n::\u2022::-I: ::<br />\n::;<br />\n1<br />\n' 41;<br />\n\u2018,\u2018:<br />\n--;:<br />\n- \u201e....<br />\n-,. ,. \u201e. 0.<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n<br />\nIk<br />\n<br />\n,:<br />\n....,<br />\ndo7,,c,<br />\n1<br />\n75<br />\n;1 .<br />\n70:,,,,,,?:<br />\n:<br />\n47::<br />\n:.i<br />\n:::<br />\n:<br />\n:4 -.7*siwi<br />\n,.:.7.<br />\n:<br />\n41w<br />\n1 ... tea,<br />\nlli.<br />\nz:77:<br />\n<br />\n64<br />\n. ,440<br />\n40.4,<br />\n,1<br />\n\u2018<br />\n4 1t*ite<br />\n,too<br />\n,<br />\n,,, 0,<br />\n4<br />\n,041,z<br />\nHictot,iiist-.4.<br />\n' ., #<br />\ng 16,<br />\n-listrt ir i - - '<br />\n164,\u201e4441,<br />\n. 4111,:tc<br />\nio<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n,\" ,4:41111111<br />\n<br />\n' 44,,,,<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\ni.<br />\no \u00d8IP 4i\u2022<br />\n<br />\noz _i:<br />\n:14Wr0<br />\nritlt 3117IPR*<br />\ntie<br />\nab'Ita<br />\na:<br />\n:k':::Al7<br />\n4<br />\n\\'I'l it<br />\nk*:Y<br />\nlt<br />\n<br />\nS;<br />\nk:<br />\n411144711<br />\nvk ::<br />\n111<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\nw::<br />\nt,.w<br />\nP 040,ift; ts!,<br />\n<br />\n\u2018,..\".1010:$1.:\u2018,..r<br />\n.:<br />\n,<br />\n1<br />\n.

The team's<br />\nuniforms were virtually identical, though, and he mistook<br />\nCarolina midfielder James<br />\nKoester for a Blue Jay. The<br />\nresult was an easy Tar Heel<br />\nbreak and a John Szczypinski<br />\ngoal at 9:36.<br />\nCarolina had a good chance<br />\nto take the lead two minutes<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nlater in a man up situation, but<br />\nJones made a couple of nice<br />\nsaves and the Jays, specifically<br />\nBubier, started to roll. First, the<br />\njunior took a pass from Dressel<br />\nwith 1:15 to go in the first<br />\nquarter off a double pick and<br />\nfired home. Next, Jones fed<br />\nMcLam at midfield on a perfect<br />\noutlet pass, and then McLam<br />\nraced into the zone and passed<br />\nto Wood who flicked to Bubier<br />\n<br />\nHopkins vs. Army<br />\n<br />\nWhere: Michie Stadium, West Point<br />\nWhen: Saturday, 7:30 p.m.<br />\nCoverage: WJ HU, 88.1 FM, beginning at 7:15 p.m.<br />\nPreview: It seems as if each team can respond to the way<br />\ntheir season is transpiring in two ways. Hopkins,<br />\ncoming off last week's feathering of the Tar Heels,<br />\nlooks like they're in prime playoff form. There's<br />\nalways the chance of a letdown though, especially<br />\nwith mega-games coming up in the next two weeks<br />\nagainst Maryland and Navy.<br />\nArmy had high hopes going into the season and<br />\nwas ranked fifth, but now stands at a mediocre 3-3<br />\nafter getting bombed 12-4 by Navy at home. They<br />\nmay pack it in and just play out the string, or they<br />\nmay go all out against Hopkins in the hopes of<br />\nsalvaging the season.<br />\nThe Cadets are too talented to be taken lightly.<br />\nBob Betchley is an excellent attackman, and Dan<br />\nWilliams is widely considered to be one of the<br />\nNCAA's best defensemen. They're a very physical<br />\nteam and will hit the Jays early, late, and often,<br />\nand they'll also have the home field edge. Despite<br />\nall of this, Hopkins is just too good for them, and<br />\nif Hopkins plays like they did last week, they're<br />\nunbeatable.<br />\n<br />\nfor an easy goal early in the second period.<br />\nAt 3:23 Bubier and Wood<br />\ncombined again. It started at<br />\nmidfield, where Jon Krome<br />\nkept an errant Blue Jay pass inthe offensive sone by scooping<br />\nthe ball to Wood. Wood then<br />\nran to the center of the field<br />\nand fed to Bubier on the left of<br />\nthe net. Bubier promptly cut to<br />\nthe middle and blasted it in<br />\nfrom about ten yards.<br />\nWithin three minutes, the<br />\ntwo All-America's teamed up<br />\nfor goals two more times and<br />\nessentially put Carolina out of<br />\ncommission. With 10 minutes<br />\nto go in the half, John DeTommaso broke down and passed<br />\nto Wood, who then fed Bubier,<br />\nwho threw in a soft bouncer<br />\nthat Barney Aburn wasn't<br />\nready for. A finesse goal. One<br />\nminute later, Bubier dished to<br />\nWood and Wood fired in a<br />\nbullet from about 15 yards out.<br />\nBefore you could 'say \"Willie<br />\nScroggs,\" a tight game had<br />\nbecome a 6-1 rout. Strangely,<br />\nScroggs never called a timeout<br />\nduring the onslaught and didn't<br />\nchange his lineup much,<br />\nperhaps sensing that there was<br />\nno hope.<br />\nAll he did do was to switch<br />\nhis<br />\ndefensive<br />\naround<br />\nassignments. It quieted Wood<br />\nand Bubier down a bit, but then<br />\neveryone else came alive.<br />\nThe Jays made it 7-1 at 7:26<br />\nof the second quarter as Larry<br />\nLedoyen scored off a pass from<br />\nBruce Chanenchuk. Carolina<br />\n<br />\ncame back with a Chris<br />\nGalgano score on a man-up<br />\nsituation, but then Del Dressel<br />\ndecided to put on a show.<br />\nHis first goal of the day<br />\nshould have gotten extra points<br />\nfor degree of difficulty. Dressel<br />\npicked up a loose ball about<br />\neight yards or so in front of the<br />\nnet and proceeded to crank in<br />\na rocket, backhanded, while be-<br />\n<br />\ning knocked off his feet. Aburn<br />\ncould not have possibly even<br />\nseen the shot until it was behind<br />\nhim. His next goal, coming<br />\nwith 18 seconds left in the half,<br />\nwas a bit more ordinary. It was<br />\njust your standard 15 yard,<br />\n1000 m.p.h. shot that made it<br />\n9-2 going into intermission.<br />\nContinued on Page 35<br />\n<br />\n\"THE JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nTHE PATIO/PAVILLION<br />\nNOON PERFORMANCE<br />\nSERIES<br />\nPresents<br />\n<br />\nCOMPANY<br />\npresents its<br />\n<br />\nSPRING CONCERT<br />\n1986<br />\nThursday and Friday, April 17 & 18<br />\n8:00 pm<br />\nShriver Hall, JHU<br />\nadmission: $2.00 students, sr. citizens<br />\n$3.00 general<br />\n<br />\nOne full hour of classical<br />\nmusic performed on violins<br />\nTUESDAY, APRIL 15<br />\n12:00 - 1:00p.m.<br />\nLEVERING PATIO<br />\nRain site: Glass Pavillion<br />\nSPONSORED BY THE<br />\nHOPKINS UNION<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/35<br />\n<br />\nBabb's Bombers Keep On Blasting Away<br />\nContinued from Page 31<br />\nthird and adding 2 more RBI's<br />\nin the fourth.

Instead, we have<br />\ndevoted much of the paper to covering Spring Fair, the annual carnival and crafts show held at the Homewood campus. If you are one of our regular reader, you are surely<br />\nfamiliar with the fair, hut we hope you still enjoy our expanded coverage of it. If you're a visitor to the campus,<br />\n.we're glad you picked up the News-Letter, and we hope you<br />\ncan learn something new about Hopkins and the fair. Either<br />\nway, for a detailed look at what can be found within the<br />\npaper, see the Table of Contents on page 2.<br /><br />\nPull on your poncho, grab<br />\nyour sombrero, and slurp down<br />\na pina colada 'cause Fiesta '86<br />\nis coming your way.<br />\nThe annual Hopkins rite of<br />\nspring which will he kicked off<br />\nat noon today marks the biggest<br />\nweekend on the Hopkins calendar, attracting more than<br />\n100,000 visitors to the<br />\nIlomeNN ood campus for a<br />\nweekend of festivities. \u2022<br />\nAs always, Spring Fair will<br />\nbe a second heaven for shoppers, overflowing with arts and<br />\ncrafts of every possible variety.<br />\nAnd this year, Fair CoChairmen Mark Komisky and<br />\nJim Farina have promised better merchandise than in years<br /><br />\npast, thanks to a renewed commitment to attracting only<br />\ncraftsmen of the highest<br />\nquality.<br />\nAt the same time, those who<br />\nprefer to spend their pesos on<br />\ntheir palates will not be at a<br />\nloss. Food of every conceivable<br />\nethnic and domestic variety will<br />\nbe at hand throughout the fair<br />\nto satisfy every taste. Although,<br />\nif you want to buy a beer to<br />\nchase your burrito, you'll be<br />\nconfined to the President's<br />\nGarden, as in years past.<br />\nThis year, the fair will once<br />\nagain lack what was once the<br />\n\"traditional\" fair concert and<br />\nthe 10 K run, but Komisky and<br />\nFarina say they hope that the<br /><br />\ncontinuation of the fair games<br />\nlaunched last year for the first<br />\ntime will more than make up<br />\nfor the lost events. Nighttime<br />\nactivities have also been expanded, to beef up the chilly<br />\nevenings.<br />\nAs always, this year's Spring<br />\nFair is completely student<br />\norganized and directed. Hundreds of undergraduates work<br />\nfor several months to plan the<br />\nevent.<br />\nIt is, to say the least, a major undertaking, and one of the<br />\nmost memorable weekends of<br />\nthe year both for Hopkins and<br />\nthe surrounding community.<br /><br />\n2/APRIL 11, 1986<br /><br />\nTable of Contents<br />\nEver wonder how this whole thing got started? Or<br />\nwho's responsible for all those great cars in front of<br />\nHomewood House? Or just what exactly the \"Fair<br />\nGames\" are?<br />\nWell, the answers to all those questions\u2014and to a<br />\ngood many others\u2014can be found right here, in our<br />\nspecial Spring Fair issue.<br />\nSince we've doubled our normal circulation this<br />\nweek and since we're distributing the paper at several<br />\npoints around the fair, we suspect many of you may<br />\nnot know too much about us. Therefore, a brief<br />\nexplanation:<br />\nThe News-Letter is the weekly student newspaper<br />\nat Hopkins. We publish every Friday except during<br />\nfinals and University holidays, and the paper is<br />\ndistributed to four campuses\u2014the Homewood campus at 3400 North Charles St., the East Baltimore campus (where the School of Medicine and the Hospital<br />\nare located), the Peabody Conservatory and Goucher<br />\nCollege in Towson.<br />\nLike the fair, we are a student organization; unlike<br />\nthe fair, we aren't controlled in any way by the University's administration.<br />\nOur offices are located at the south end of the campus (near the Baltimore Museum of Art) in a (to put<br />\nit nicely) picturesque little building called the<br />\nGatehouse.<br />\nWe seek to cover the people and events of Hopkins,<br />\nfocusing most heavily on Homewood. Obviously, the<br />\nFair is more than a minor event for the University,<br />\nand\u2014for that matter\u2014for all of Baltimore.<br />\nSo this year, we've expanded our coverage of the<br />\nfair greatly. A few highlights:<br />\n*If you're wondering how the fair got started, turn<br />\nto page 24. There you'll find an interview with Andy<br />\nSavitz, who founded the fair about 15 years ago as a<br />\nstudent. It was just slightly smaller than it is today\u2014<br />\nthe whole event covered about one-third of<br />\nHomewood's Upper Quad. Nonetheless, the fair grew,<br />\neventually drawing\u2014as it does today--more than<br />\n100,000 people to the campus.<br /><br />\nSpring Fair News<br /><br />\nCourtesy of News and Information<br /><br />\n*To be honest, we should mention that in the last<br />\ncouple years, the fair has lost some events (the traditional 10K run, for example), but last year it also gained one: Fair Games. Essentially, the games are a<br />\nchance for students to relax a little, and for everybody<br />\nelse to watch them making fools of themselves.

The<br />\nfirst and simplest is \"mutually<br />\nassured destruction,\" which involves ensuring that \"an adversary state\" would \"be<br />\ndestroyed as a viable society\"<br />\nin retaliation for any nuclear attack. He said that neither the<br />\nU.S. or the U.S.S.R. has ever<br />\nactually relied on this principle.<br />\nThe second theory involves<br />\nmaking the adversary aware<br />\nthat in the event of an attack,<br />\nthe country will still retain<br />\nenough force to counterattack<br />\nagainst the other side's military<br />\nand render the adversary<br /><br />\nin a worse-off position.<br />\nGarwin began his speech by<br />\nsaying that the initial goal of<br />\nthe SDI program as presented<br />\nby President Reagan was that<br />\nof a perfect defense, and<br />\nthat the goal was later revised<br />\nwhen it was found to be<br />\nunfeasible.

The original date<br />\nfor the extravaganza was also<br />\nset on the April 11-13 weekend<br />\nattracting concern from some<br />\ncouncil members and prompting Komisky to say, \"The<br />\ndate puts fair right in the midst<br />\nof a rainy season.\"<br />\nNevertheless, planning of the<br />\nevent continued for the midApril date.<br />\nAfter their selection,<br />\nKomisky and Farina began<br />\nconducting interviews for the<br />\nselection<br />\nof committee<br />\nchairmen. The results of that<br />\nselection process were then announced on November 22.<br />\nSeventeen committees were<br />\nestablished at that time with 30<br />\ncommittee co-chairmen<br />\nIn addition, Brad Handler<br />\nwas chosen to be the assistant<br />\ntreasurer, a new position this<br />\nyear, in order to help Treasurer<br />\nCarolyn Willis. The purpose of<br /><br />\n_<br />\nthe new position, according to<br />\nFarina, was to keep the<br />\ntreasurer from having to<br />\n\"count money all day and all<br />\nnight.\"<br />\nAlso, at about the same time<br />\nthe committee chairmen were<br />\nselected, the fair theme was tentatively chosen to be Fiesta at<br />\nthe suggestion of Theme Chairman Donald Jacobson.<br />\nThen on December 4, the<br />\nStudent Cowicil unanimously<br />\npassed a resolution proposed by<br />\nKomisky to push the date of the<br />\nfair to the weekend of May 2-4.<br />\nThe primary reason for the<br />\nmove was to decrease the threat<br />\nof rain or cold weather according to Komisky.<br /><br />\nSpring Fair'86<br />\n3400 On Stage<br />\nPlanning<br />\nKomisky said, \"The fair<br />\nbasically hinges on the weather.<br />\nSince Spring Fair is held entirely outdoors, a rainout would<br />\ncause major financial losses.\"<br />\nKomisky also cited the May<br />\ndate as an advantage since it<br />\nwould take place after the<br />\nMCATs permitting more<br />\nstudents to enjoy the fair.<br />\nThe university administration also approved the move according to Komisky's report to<br />\nthe council.<br />\nHowever, during the first<br />\nsemester exam period and over<br />\nChristmas vacation, problems<br />\ndeveloped with the May date<br />\nthat led council to reverse its<br />\ndecision at its first meeting back<br />\nfrom vacation.<br />\nOn a 13-5-0 vote, council<br />\nmoved the fair date back to the<br />\nApril 11-13 weekend at the re-<br /><br />\nquest of the Homewood deans.<br />\nAccording to Komisky, the<br />\ndeans received a complaint<br />\nfrom the Mathematics Department which had scheduled a<br />\nconference of international<br />\nmathematicians for May 3 at<br />\nHomewood well over a year<br />\nbeforehand.<br />\n\"The Math Department<br />\noriginally scheduled the conference for the weekend of<br />\nApril 12, but then moved the<br />\ndate to May 3 when informed<br />\nthat it would probably coincide<br />\nwith Spring Fair,\" explained<br />\nKomisky. When the deans were<br />\nconsulted about the change to<br />\nthe May weekend, they evidently forgot about or were<br />\nunaware of the math conference, according to Komisky.<br />\nFollowing the date shuffle,<br />\nfair planning pt\u00b0ceded but was<br />\nmarked with some disappointments. On February 17,<br />\nKomisky said the fair \"is going<br />\nreally well thus far even though<br />\nwe've had a few setbacks.\"<br />\nDuring mid-February, for<br />\nexample, it became increasingly clear that the booking of a<br />\nfair concert would be unfeasible, although the final decision<br />\nto scrap the event was not made<br />\nuntil some weeks later.<br />\nIn addition, problems with<br />\nthe 10 K run that would eventually cause its disappearance<br />\nfrom the fair agenda were<br />\nculminating. As Komisky said<br />\nat the time, the 10 K run is \"a<br />\ntouchy issue this year,\" and it<br />\nwill be held only if \"funds are<br />\nsufficient from the general fair<br />\nsponsorship. Nike turned us<br />\ndown. Brooks hasn't responded very well.\"<br />\nNow after months of<br />\npreparation, Farina and<br />\nKomisky have only the highest<br />\nhopes for the most successful<br />\nfair ever.<br /><br />\nCourtesy of Netts ana irttormauon<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nft.]<br /><br />\nat<br />\n44<br /><br />\nall<br /><br />\nCourtesy of News and Information<br /><br />\nFair Treasurer Says<br />\nBreaking Even Goal<br />\nby Jon Stempel<br />\n\"It's not at all a profitmaking effort,\" said Spring<br />\nFair Co-Chairman Jim Farina<br />\nabout the fair.<br />\nFair Treasurer Carolyn Willis<br />\nagreed. \"Basically, a profit<br />\nwouldn't be bad,\" she said,<br />\n\"but the fair goal is to break<br />\neven. We won't cut spending to<br />\nmake a profit.\"<br /><br />\nSpring Fair'86<br />\n3400 On StageFinances<br />\nFarina said that past fairs<br />\nhave had varied financial success, but he added, \"Overall,<br />\nyou lose a little one year, you<br />\nmake a little one year, so they<br />\nbalance out.\" He said that if<br />\nthe fair showed a surplus, all<br />\nprofits would go to the Student<br />\nActivities Committee and be<br />\ndistributed to various student<br />\ngroups.<br />\nHe said that the fair has insurance to help protect against<br />\none potential cause of lost<br />\nrevenue, rain. \"It's useful to<br />\nhave rain insurance,\" he said,<br />\nbut he added that rain insurance cannot cover all<br />\nrevenue lost to rain.<br />\nFarina remembered a recent<br />\nfair that was drenched with<br />\nrain on its final day, and noted<br />\nthat although the fair had rain<br />\ninsurance, it showed a big loss.<br />\nHe concluded, \"Hopefully,<br />\nthat won't happen again.\"<br />\nHe and Willis declined to<br />\ndiscuss the anticipated revenues<br />\nand expenditures of the fair,<br />\nWillis citing \"University<br />\npolicy,\" but Willis said that the<br />\nfair spends money on the basis<br />\nof its projected earnings.<br />\nWillis added that the fair's<br /><br />\n44<br /><br />\nti<br /><br />\nS(<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nS(<br /><br />\nti<br /><br />\nbudget is earmarked for<br />\ndecorations, garbage clean-up,<br />\noffice supplies, parking<br />\nmonitors, performers, portable<br />\nbathrooms, programs, publicity, security, shirts for those<br />\nwho organize the fair, and<br />\n\"tons of other things.\"<br />\nFair Assistant Treasure Brad<br />\nHandler said that each committee chairman \"is allotted a certain amount of money based<br />\nupon what materials he needs.\"<br />\nAccording to Willis, the fair<br />\ndoes not hive to make any<br />\nspecial payments to the city of<br />\nBaltimore this year. \"The only<br />\ntime we would have had to pay<br />\nthe city is if we were to have a<br />\nrace because[we would have to]<br />\n'close the streets,\" she said.<br />\nConcerning<br />\nrevenues,<br />\nHandler said, \"There's a hope<br />\nthat certain things can be gotten through sponsors, though<br />\nit's risky because you can't<br />\nalways get everything. Certain<br />\nthings have been donated, but<br />\nnot as many as we'd like.\"<br />\nWillis agreed, saying, 'We.<br />\ntried to get [major] corporate<br />\nsponsors but we couldn't get<br />\nany... because we started too<br />\nlate in the year. We did get<br />\nsome donations,\" but she<br />\nnoted that the donations were<br />\nof equipment and were not<br />\nmonetary.<br />\nHandler, though, did note<br />\nthat certain things, such as<br />\nballoons, will have businesses'<br />\nnames printed on them.<br />\nWillis said that the fair also<br />\nreceives varying fees from<br />\nbooth operators. She said that<br />\nrents, excluding electricity<br />\ncharges, are $80 for arts and<br />\ncrafts booths, $105 for soda<br />\nbooths, $35 for \"non-profit\"<br />\nbooths, and varying amounts<br />\nfor food booths, depending on<br />\ntheir sizes.<br />\nShe also noted that-student<br />\ngroups may operate booths at<br />\ndiscounted rates.<br /><br />\nCI<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/ 1<br /><br />\nFiesta '86<br />\nVending to be More<br />\nThan 'Flea Market'<br /><br />\nFiesta Theme<br />\nSelected For<br />\n'Merriment'<br />\nby Jon Stempel<br /><br />\nby Greg Hung<br /><br />\n\"It seemed like the one that<br />\nwould make the most merriment,\" said Spring Fair CoChairman Jim Farina about the<br />\nfair's theme, \"Fiesta '86.\"<br />\nFarina said that at first, he<br />\nand Co-Chairman Mark<br />\nKomisky had been considering<br />\n\"Mardi Gras\" and \"Broadway\" as fair themes.<br />\nFarina added that he and<br />\nKomisky got the idea for the<br /><br />\nArts and crafts at this year's<br />\nSpring Fair promises to be<br />\nmore than the giant flea market<br />\nof recent years.

The list of ethnic foods<br />\nincludes two kinds of Chinese,<br />\nIndian, Greek, Japanese,<br />\nKorean, and of course, Mexican.

A<br />\nportion of the text of that conversations follows.<br /><br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br /><br />\nSpring Fair Co-Chairmen Mark Komisky and Aim Farina who discussed their siews on the lair with the News-Letter<br />\nthis week.<br /><br />\nflea market people, basically<br />\nthe people who sell cheap mass<br />\nproduced junk that we didn't<br />\nwant any more. And they<br />\n[Estella and Gilmore] made a<br />\ngreat effort to get real craftsmen here. People who cut glass,<br /><br />\nA concert is always feasible. It's just that with the timeframe we were running along, and the amount and the band<br />\nwe were looking at, we just couldn't have put it together.<br />\n\u2014Farina<br />\nthings, weather being one of<br />\nthem, attendance being<br />\nanother, just general revenues<br />\nbeing a third. So there's not<br />\nreally any way we can predict.<br />\nOn paper we look great. But<br />\nthere's no way we can predict<br />\nthat it won't be a total wash-out<br />\nbecause of factors we can't<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nKomisky: As far as student<br />\ninvolvement, I'd say...there's<br />\na lot of people who want to be<br />\nin the fair. There are always a<br />\nlot of student groups. We've<br />\nhad, what, 60 people applying<br />\nfor like 16 soda booths. So<br />\nthere's always a lot of people'<br />\nwho want to be in the fair.<br />\nIn some instances, we<br />\nhaven't had as much student<br />\ngroup participation because of<br />\na cut-back in the number of<br />\nbooths. Now it wasn't completely on our part.... The<br />\npeople interested in running<br />\nbooths just didn't quite come<br />\nthrough.<br />\nAs far as community involvement, like he said, attendance<br />\nis really a big thing as far as<br />\nhow solvent the fair will be, and<br />\nit's very hard to predict. So far,<br />\nwe've had a lot of cooperation<br />\nfrom the surrounding community. They've been very<br />\nhelpful.<br />\nNews-Letter: How well attended by students do you think<br />\nthis fair will be considering that<br />\nit won't coincide with the end<br /><br />\nparticipate in fair in some way<br />\nor another.

So what<br />\nsteps have you taken to reduce<br />\nthe commercial nature of the<br />\nfair this year?<br />\nFarina: OK, the major emphasis on that was in the area<br />\nof arts and crafts. .. .

It won't show up this year,<br />\nbut in the next year or two it<br />\nwill become evident that we've<br />\nreally improved the quality of<br />\nwhat is sold here during the<br />\ndaytime.<br />\nKomisky: In general...we<br />\nalso got them [vendors] to<br />\ndemonstrate crafting silver, or<br />\nwhat not. And doing that I<br />\nthink will move away from just<br />\na selling type atmosphere to<br />\nmore of an interaction atmosphere where people get to<br />\nsee what's actually going on<br /><br />\nI know people who are taking the<br />\nMCATs...and it's not going to ruin<br />\ntheir weekend that [Spring Fair] is a<br />\nweek before the MCATs.<br />\n\u2014Farina<br />\nnie Estella and Carol Gilmore<br />\nhave been excellent at doing<br />\ntheir job. [Because] we have<br />\ndecreased the number of<br />\nbooths, there are fewer booths<br />\nthis year than there were last<br />\nyear.<br />\nWe cut out a number of the<br />\nantique dealers, we cut out the<br /><br />\nwith these things.<br />\nAs far as other booths are<br />\nconcerned, in cutting back on<br />\nthe number of booths, it takes<br />\naway the actual strain of selling. People get more into having fun because not every vendor is trying to snag you to get<br />\nyou to buy their thing because<br /><br />\nthey will each indivivally do<br />\nvery well on their own. So there<br />\nwon't be quite as much<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nNews-Letter: Are you disappointed that there won't be a<br />\nfair concert this year?<br />\nFarina: Disappointed, yes,<br />\nbut there were reasons that<br />\nthere was no way we could pull<br />\nit together. And it's not really<br />\nsomething we can control.<br />\nKomisky: ...there is a certain disappointment, but like he<br />\nsaid, there are a lot of other<br />\nreasons, and there are a lot of<br />\nother things I'm glad we did<br />\nrather than have a concert.<br />\nNews-Letter: The Hopkins<br />\ntradition of a fair concert has<br />\nseemingly died out in the last<br />\ncouple of years.

If we had a much<br />\nlarger hall we could hold it in<br />\nother than Shriver (Shriver only holds roughly a thousand<br />\npeople) and if we could hold a<br />\nmuch larger audience, we then<br />\ncould take in more money.<br />\nHence it would be much easier<br />\nand much more solvent to have<br />\na concert.<br />\nNews-Letter: In the aftermath of the suspension of HOP<br />\nfor alcohol violations two<br />\nweeks ago, the university<br />\nenacted a new policy that two<br />\nid's would be required to purchase alcohol for all campus<br />\nevents.

It's just that with the<br />\ntime-frame we were running<br />\nalong and the amount and the<br />\nband we were looking at, we<br />\njust couldn't have put it<br />\ntogether.

Hundreds of people.<br />\nThousands of people. You are in the<br />\nmidst, in other words, of Spring Fair.<br />\nThe Fair is, without a doubt, Hopkins'<br />\nbiggest event of the year. During the<br />\nweekend, more than 100,000 people<br />\ncram onto the campus to buy things, eat<br />\nthings, look at things and drink things.<br />\nYou are probably one of them. If you<br />\nare, welcome to Hopkins.(If you're one<br />\nof our regular readers, we're glad you<br />\nPicked up the paper too, although this<br />\nweekend we, along with the rest of the<br />\nUniversity, are mostly interested in showing off for the rest of Baltimore.)<br />\nElsewhere in this newspaper, you can<br />\nread about how the Fair is planned, but<br />\nlet us here add a few between-the-lines<br />\ncomments. The Fair is largely organized by students, although key decisions<br />\nare generally made by the administration. Still, the idea was developed by<br />\nundergraduates about 15 years ago, and<br />\nit is still essentially their show.<br />\nOne change in the Fair this year,<br />\ndeserves special notice. Simply put:<br />\nThere will be less junk for sale. In the<br />\npast, as experienced Fair-goers will surely<br />\nremember, there were tables and tables<br />\nand tables and ta... well, you get the<br /><br />\nidea, of jewelry. Cheap jewelry. Very<br />\ncheap jewelry. Most of it wasn't made<br />\nby the people selling it, and the whole<br />\nthing made the Fair look rather like a<br />\nflea market.<br />\nThis year's organizers have intentionally clamped down on such people,<br />\nemphasizing that crafts vendors for this<br />\nyear's Fair must actually have made the<br />\nstuff themselves. That means there are<br />\nfewer folks selling their wares, but we'll<br />\ntake quality over quantity any day.<br />\nStill, the Fair is a chance for<br />\nBaltimoreans to see Hopkins\u2014an interaction that takes place far too infrequently. As sad as it is to say it, there<br />\noften seems to be some sort of hostility<br />\nbetween community leaders and the<br />\nUniversity. We've discussed this fact<br />\nbefore (in connection with last fall's<br />\nWyman Park controversy), but it's<br />\nworthwhile to mention again that there<br />\nreally isn't much of a reason for animosity. Perhaps the Fair\u2014by presenting the<br />\nbetter side of Hopkins\u2014can quell some<br />\nof those feelings.<br />\nSo while you're enjoying all those<br />\ntacos and egg rolls and chicken legs, enjoy the campus in general. It's the one<br />\ntime all year we at Hopkins get to share<br />\nit with a good chunk of Baltimore.<br /><br />\nHOP Suspension:<br /><br />\nIt Was a Mistake<br />\nThere appear to be some very<br />\ninaccurate and misinformed<br />\nideas about the HOP and its<br />\nproblems with the alcohol<br />\npolicy. I will try to set the<br />\nrecord straight.<br />\nFirst of all the editorial that<br />\nappeared in last week's NewsLetter, \"Spanking the HOP,\"<br /><br />\nandrew chun<br /><br />\nwas supported by erroneous information. Mary Ellen Porter<br />\nand Andrea Perry do not sit on<br />\nthe HOP executive board. They<br />\nhave been replaced by Jane<br />\nGentil, the Union Coordinator,<br />\nand Tracey Lyons, the Program<br />\nDirector of Residential Life.<br />\nThe reason why the change was<br />\naffected was to keep the HOP<br />\nas a purely programming entity not an administrative one.<br />\nThe major reason that Porter<br />\nand Perry sat on the HOP<br />\nboard was that they used to<br />\nhandle the programming in<br />\ntheir respective departments.<br />\nThe HOP is devinitely not an<br />\nadministrative \"creature\" at<br />\nall. Perhaps the Alcohol Policy<br />\nitself is an administrative<br />\nanimal. In any case the two<br />\nshould not be confused. the<br />\nHOP does enforce the policy,<br />\nhowever, it is not open to<br />\ndebate or modification by the<br />\nexecutive board.<br />\nThe only part of the editor's<br />\nanalysis of the HOP situation<br />\nthat was accurate was the point<br />\nthat suspending the HOP was,<br />\n\"far different than suspending<br />\na frat.\" Unfortunately, his further analysis of the problem<br />\nwas not very insightful. The effect of a suspension on the<br />\nHaving sounded sufficiently like the receive. (Its signal is very weak.) This HOP was to give us a month's<br />\nvacation from running everyhouse organ for the Hopkins booster spring...er, summer... uh, fall...well, one's<br />\nalcohol events. I seriousclub, we should also mention that the sometime before hell freezes over ly doubt that when we resume<br />\nUniversity does have some problems. (maybe), the station is scheduled to serving alcohol at school events<br />\nWe've pointed them out before, but, as undergo a major power increase and (i.e. Spring Fair), that our atmentioned above, many of you are pro- become professionally managed. We tendance or image will be<br />\nbably reading our columns for the first stammer so on the date because original- changed drastically. However,<br />\nwhen a fraternity is suspended<br />\ntime. So to avoid presenting too candy- ly the larger station was supposed to be from alcoholic social activities<br /><br />\n...and the Bad<br /><br />\ncoated an image of the place, a quick<br />\nreview of some of Hopkins' trials and<br />\ntribulations:<br />\n*Almost since the beginning of the<br />\nacademic year, the University has come<br />\nunder heavy pressure from some students<br />\nto divest itself of stocks of corporations<br />\nwhich do business in South Africa. The<br />\nactive proponents of divestment\u2014a<br />\nrelatively large group by Hopkins standards but still a decided minority of the<br />\nstudent body\u2014have staged protests at<br />\nBoard of Trustees meetings and recently even held a sit-in in the administration's main building.<br />\nWhile the pro-divestment people have<br />\noccasionally over-stated their case, they<br />\nare correct in saying that universities<br />\nought to hold themselves up to a higher<br />\nmoral standard\u2014a standard that simply can't accomodate investing in companies which are intertwined in apartheid. The University ought to divest.<br />\n*There are serious problems with the<br />\nadministration, which just goofs up a lot<br />\nof the time. As an example, take the case<br />\nof WJHU,the University's radio station,<br />\nwhich most of you probably cannot<br /><br />\nup and running about a year-and-a-half<br />\nago. The delays have been so frequent,<br />\nthe foul-ups so common, that the whole<br />\naffair has become almost a parody of<br />\nhow bad the administration can get.<br />\nOr another example: This fall it came<br />\nto light that the university had placed<br />\ntelephones in every dorm room without<br />\nknowing\u2014as nearly as we can tell\u2014<br />\nprecisely what rates the students using<br />\nthe phones would be charged. At the<br />\ntime, the administration said it was<br />\n\"satisfied\" with its phone service. We're<br />\nnot satisfied with the administration.<br />\n*Students at Hopkins have a tendency to live up to their egg-headish image,<br />\nrarely becoming interested in much<br />\nbeyond their studies. Nobody has quite<br />\nfigured out how you combat that, so too<br />\nmany students remain buried in the<br />\nlibrary, intent only upon getting into med<br />\nschool.<br />\nThere are, to be sure, other problems<br />\nat Hopkins; we've listed only a few. So<br />\nwhile you're enjoying the better side of<br />\nthe University this weekend\u2014Spring<br />\nFair\u2014remember also that we have our<br />\nproblems, and we know it.<br /><br />\nit hurts them directly. The<br />\nsocial life of the brothers, the<br />\nimage of the frat, and the effective rushing of prospective<br />\npledges are all affected. The net<br />\nresults of the administration's<br />\ndecision to suspend the HOP<br />\nwere:<br />\n1) student groups were to<br /><br />\ncancel or suffer sever financial<br />\nlosses on their events, and<br />\n2) the entire school was<br />\ndenied any social programming<br />\nwith alcohol. The suspension<br />\nhurt the students the most, not<br />\nthe HOP. How can this be considered in the words of the<br />\neditor \"refreshing,\" \"heartening,\" \"pleasant,\" and \"fair\"?<br />\nThe final point I'd like to<br />\nmake is that the alcohol violations were a result of some<br />\nmisunderstandings about the<br />\npresent policy and the carryingover of practices which had<br />\nbeen in effect for social events<br />\nfor at least the past two years.<br />\nThere were no problems with<br />\nthe major points of the policy<br />\nsuch as checking ID's or serving people with wrist bands.<br />\nThe bulk of the confusion came<br />\nup over more specific items (1<br />\nor 2 ID's, number of beers per<br />\nperson, etc.).<br />\nVery simply, after the<br />\nmisunderstandings with the<br />\nalcohol policy had been<br />\nstraightened out, the HOP<br />\nshould have been allowed to go<br />\non serving the campus. There<br />\nwas no intent to purposely<br />\nviolate the policy even in the<br />\neyes of the administration. In<br />\nmy view, a suspension was<br />\nharmful, not helpful, in this<br />\ninstance.<br />\nIf there are more opinions to<br />\nbe heard about the HOP or its<br />\nactivities, I hope that they will<br />\nbe educated ones.<br /><br />\nThe writer is the director of the<br />\nHOP.<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins News.Letter<br />\nEditor<br />\nEthan Rarick<br />\nBusiness Manager<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nMary Ginder<br />\nProduction Manager<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nTimothy McNamara, A.J.

Buckley. The<br /><br />\nbatteries.<br />\nSeveral months ago each<br />\nmember of the Senior class<br />\nreceived a ballot form asking<br />\nthem to vote for their choice for<br /><br />\njoel greenwald<br />\nspeaker selected this year is the<br />\nmuch ballyhooed oceanographer Roger Revelle. Gee, I'd better tell friends and relatives to<br />\nget here early in order to get a<br />\nseat. After all, Senior Class<br />\nPresident Paul Donio said<br />\nRevelle is \"not a famous person, but his appeal is wide.\"<br />\nAn oceanographer with a wide<br />\nappeal?! Yeah, sure, maybe<br />\namongst mollusks and crustaceans. I believe that students<br />\nwant a well known commencement speaker, and truthfully I<br />\ndo not agree with Paul Donio's<br />\ncomment that Revelle will<br />\n\"relate to the people here.\"<br />\nworse. Sea<br />\ngets<br />\nIt<br />\nhas callmagazine<br />\nTechnology<br />\ned Revelle \"one of the two or<br />\narticulate<br />\nmost<br />\nthree<br />\nspokesmen for science in the<br />\nworld.\" My subscription to Sea<br />\nTechnology expired last month,<br />\nso I can't validate this. Articulate? You'd better believe it.<br />\nRevelle's pearls include<br />\n\"Oceanographers are just<br />\nsailors who use big words,\"<br />\nand \"Oceanography is fun.\"<br />\nOceanography might be \"fun\"<br />\nat Gilligan's Island, but not at<br />\ngraduation.<br />\nThe article in last week's<br />\nNews-Letter concluded that the<br />\nexact subject of the commencement address has not yet been<br />\ndetermined. Don't worry, it<br />\nshouldn't be boring. The article said that his research includes 'Studies of the Ecological Effects of Atomic Devices<br />\nand Studies of the Geology of<br />\nthe Sea Floor in the Pacific.'<br />\nCome graduation day, I hope<br />\nmy Walkman has fresh<br /><br />\nthe speaker. The names I saw<br />\nincluded Peter Ueberroth,<br />\nGeraldine Ferraro, and Walter<br />\nCronkite. Hmm,seems funny,<br />\nI don't recall Roger Revelle's<br />\nname on my questionnaire.<br />\nWith the names that we were<br />\ngiven to choose from, I figured<br />\nthat the committee seemed on<br />\nthe right track. Now months<br />\nlater, I, like many other seniors,<br /><br />\nAn oceanographer<br />\nwith a wide appeal?<br />\nYeah, sure, maybe<br />\namongst mollusks...<br />\nMy Subscription to<br />\nSea Technology expired last month.<br />\nregret that I didn't take a more<br />\nactive role in the selection<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nSure, with our two thousand<br />\ndollar budget one could hardly<br />\nexpect to catch the big fish.<br />\nHowever, isn't it true that<br />\ngovernment officials are not<br />\nallowed to accept more than<br />\n$2500 for speaking engagements? How about a local<br />\nsenator? And, if money is so<br />\ntight, why weren't the senior<br />\nclass members solicited for<br />\nmore money?<br />\nRoger Revelle? Did someone<br />\nsay Tom Carvel? No, the reality is that although Revelle<br />\nmight be a fine speaker, there<br />\nare many fine speakers here on<br />\ncampus.

It would be absurd to editor (\"Hollow Rhetoric\") in<br />\nsay that the council did not hear last week's News-Letter, both<br />\nContinued from Page 21<br /><br />\nof which attacked a position<br />\nstatement written by myself and<br />\nTheo Nkone. (For its own<br />\nreasons, the News-Letter only<br />\nnoted me as the author.)<br />\n1) Gatsha Buthelezi is described by Wolford as being<br />\n\"faithful to the strategy of nonviolent resistance.\" While this<br />\nmight be Buthelezi's view<br />\ntowards the racist South African<br />\ngovernment, it is very well<br />\ndocumented that in just the last<br />\nyear, his lnkatha organization<br />\nhas killed dozens of United<br />\nDemocratic Front activists, socalled Indians in Durban, and<br />\nmembers of the Ponda tribe.<br />\nBeing nonviolent to the apartheid police state and nonviolent to one's own people is<br />\nrather telling. Incidentally, Inkatha kills most of its victims<br />\nwith spears and other tribal<br />\nweapons; our adjective \"spearthrowing\" was thus descriptive<br />\nand racist. \"Tribalistic\" is used by many black South<br />\nAfricans to describe Inkatha.<br />\nWolford singles me (a white)<br />\nout for criticism on use of<br />\nwords while ignoring my coauthor Nkone, a black South<br />\nAfrican. We are both quite<br />\naware of subtleties of language.<br />\n2) Wolford suggests that Inkatha is not a group limited to<br />\nthe Zulu tribe but includes<br />\nother South African blacks. We<br />\nsuggest that the Inkatha's Zulu<br />\nmembership exceeds 99 percent<br />\nof the group; Inkatha is nearly<br />\nalways described as a Zulu<br />\norganization and Buthelezi as<br /><br />\nIntroducing the lower cost of higher education.<br />\n,<br />\n'Ciiiiiii1111111111111111111 .iiiiii0111! 111111<br />\nLustritilln.<br /><br />\nthe leader of the Zulus. No<br />\nanti-apartheid leader in South<br />\nAfrica accepts such tribal<br />\nlabels. While Buthelezi is<br />\nrhetorically skilled in decrying<br />\napartheid and tribalism, the<br />\nreality remains and is reflected<br />\nin descriptions used not just by<br />\nmyself and Nkone, but by the<br />\nworld press as well.<br />\n3) Regarding ties to the<br />\nBotha government, the difference between the employers<br />\nof Rev. Alan Boesak (University of the Western Cape) and<br />\nButhelezi(Department of Bantu Administration) should be<br />\nclear. Boesak's role in having<br />\nthe World Council of Reformed Churches, of which he was<br />\nrecently the President, label<br />\napartheid a \"heresy\" absolves<br />\nhim of the guilt by association<br />\n(i.e., that the Reformed Church<br />\nin South Africa is racially divided) that Wolford heaps upon<br />\nhim. By the nature of the apartheid system, there are only a<br />\nminute number of multi-racial<br />\nchurches in South Africa;<br />\nBoesak must operate within this<br />\nstructure. Buthelezi, on the<br />\nother hand, operates within the<br />\nhomeland structure\u2014he is the<br />\nde facto ruler of the<br />\nZululands\u2014which has often<br />\nbeen condemned as apartheid's<br />\nmost blatant affront to the<br />\ndignity of black South<br />\nAfricans.<br />\n4) Wolford uses the obscure<br />\nSouth African Indian Academy<br />\nto again attempt to legitimize<br />\nButhelezi. There are certainly<br /><br />\nso-called Indians who play a<br />\nrole similar to Buthelezi\u2014<br />\ncollaborating in the oppression<br />\nof millions of Africans for their<br />\nown personal gain. Indeed,<br />\nthere is an Indian third<br />\nchamber in the South African<br />\nParliament, whose members<br />\nwealthy<br />\nare<br />\ngenerally<br />\nbusinesspeople with no real<br />\npower or proven desire to fundamentally change the system.<br />\nIn view of Pretoria's attempt to<br />\nuse such people, the United<br />\nDemocratic Front persuaded 89<br />\npercent of the Indian people to<br />\nboycott the recent Parliamentary elections. But just last<br />\nweek, the Indian Members of<br />\nParliament\u2014generally called<br />\n\"sell-outs\" and \"stooges\" by<br />\nactivists in South Africa\u2014<br />\nbegan discussing a powersharing arrangement in Natal<br />\nProvince with Buthelezi and a<br />\nfew white liberals.

It is<br />\nfor this kind of compromising<br />\nposition with Pretoria, as well<br />\nas for the attacks on antiapartheid activists, that<br />\nButhelezi and Inkatha are hated<br />\nso much by so many black<br />\nSouth Africans.

As a<br />\nformer student leader on the<br />\ncampus, 1 object to Chen's<br />\ndescription of the Student<br />\nCouncil as an ineffectual<br /><br />\n\"home of nepotism on a grand<br />\nscale.\" As a member of last<br />\nyear's council, I saw many<br />\nvaluable programs begin\u2014such<br />\nas the faculty-student interaction fund, the quad-monitors,<br />\nthe security phones, the HOP,<br />\nthe Rotunda shuttle, the airport<br />\nshuttle, as well as other<br />\nprograms\u2014which Chen sees as<br />\nnot significantly improving the<br />\nlife of student. It is true that<br />\nthere have been problems in<br />\nthis year's council (due, in my<br />\nopinion, to the amount of<br />\npolitical types of issues they<br />\nhave been forced to deal with),<br />\nbut this is no reason to<br />\nreorganize the entire system of<br />\nStudent Council.<br />\nChen, it seems to me that you<br />\ndon't understand that the council is not (and shouldn't be) a<br />\nbody with the power to instantly change University policy\u2014<br />\nnor does it have unlimited<br />\nfunds to work with. The council, through the work on its<br />\ncommittees and Executive<br />\nBoard, does recommend action<br />\nto the administration; and<br />\nalthough Student Activities<br />\nfunding has been a question of<br />\nthe council's, the council does<br />\nits best to distribute funds (as<br />\nit sees fit) to implement programs for the student body's<br />\nbenefit. You act as if the council members of last and this<br />\nyear care nothing about the<br />\nWJHU and Hut issues. Last<br />\nyear's council addressed both<br />\nissues, and using the proper<br />\nchannels of the university attempted to act on them. This<br />\n\"board with no executive<br />\npowers\" you are suggesting<br />\nwould surely fail without the<br />\nsupport of the university administration.<br />\nAs far as the point of your<br />\n\"cursory look\" at the Young<br /><br />\nTrustee statements, speaking as<br />\none who had a statement in that<br />\nbatch-1 object to your referring to the candidates as being<br />\npeople with a \"long history of<br />\nincompetence\" who promote<br />\nan \"unhealthy degree of<br />\nhomogeneity.\" I, and the other<br />\ntrustee candidates, worked hard<br />\nfor (and in) the positions we<br />\nhad. If we got many positions,<br />\nit was because people like you<br />\nelected us, or a qualified group<br />\nsuch as the Committee on<br />\nCommittees chose us. It is by<br />\nusing qualified and proven people (with a healthy influx of<br />\n\"new blood\") for committee<br />\nchairs, that one can make committees stronger. Is it my fault<br />\nthat others have not served on<br />\ncomittees while I have served<br />\non more than one? No! In fact,<br />\nit shows my (and others) interest in the University community; that I would give many<br />\nhours of my time and hard<br /><br />\nwork to improve life at<br />\nHopkins. I am not asking for a<br />\npat on the back from you, Joe,<br />\nI got plenty back out of my<br />\nactivities\u2014but only because I<br />\nput a great deal into it. If your<br />\nare not pleased with the people<br />\nholding positions because of the<br />\njob they are doing, you should<br />\nfeel free to voice your grievance<br />\nto the council. That is the use<br />\nof democracy. Limiting the<br />\nnumber of times a person can<br />\nserve on your \"board\" shows<br />\na \"slight\" descrepancy in your<br />\nview of democracy.<br />\nNo Joe, I think you should<br />\nstop believing that the student<br />\ncouncil should be some<br />\n\"revolutionary\" body which<br />\nassumes absolute control over<br />\nthe workings of the university<br />\nand start thinking about what<br />\ncommittee you have some suggestions for\u2014the council<br />\nmeeting is on Wednesday night.<br />\nIn fact, what surprises me Joe,<br /><br />\ntime and again in independent<br />\npolls blacks have said that they<br />\nknow they will have to undergo<br />\nfurther hardship because of<br />\neconomic sanctions, but that<br />\nthey are prepared to do so.<br />\nOther individuals on campus<br />\nmay find themselves saying well<br />\nand good to these discussions<br />\nbut asking how Hopkins fits into such issues of international<br />\nscope. Why get involved? Why<br />\ntake any financial risk on a<br />\nmoral issue? The answer is that<br />\nthis issue is unusual of its kind,<br />\nfirstly, because we are virtually unanimous on the evil that is<br />\ninvolved in grand apartheid<br />\nand, secondly, we have that<br />\nrare opportunity of actually<br />\nhaving a genuine impact on a<br />\nsituation. This movement to<br />\ndivest has wide support, a<br />\nsidely-recognized and credible<br />\nrationale, and it is affecting<br />\ncorporations and governments.<br />\nAs a university we should not<br />\nexpend our moral capital<br />\ncasually,and this is not casual.<br />\nIt is worth using our moral<br />\nclout to worry the corporations,<br />\nto worry the South African<br />\ngovernment and to inspire<br />\nother institutions to follow suit.<br />\nWe can do all of this, as<br /><br />\nwe've argued, with little financial risk to ourselves. A phased<br />\ndivestment where stock is sold<br />\nat advantageous points and<br />\nwhere we purchase a core of<br />\nSouth Africa-free solid bluechip stocks (of which there are<br />\ndozens\u2014surprise, there is life<br />\nafter IBM!), could well result in<br />\nHopkins making a profit, as no<br />\nless than Mr. Riggs-Griffith,<br />\nour treasurer, has admitted.<br />\nThinking ideologicaly once<br />\nagain, they think we should only fault our \"strategic enemies\"<br />\nand never utter a word against<br />\nour \"strategic friends.\" It must<br />\nnever transpire, however, that<br />\nwe become so closely bound to<br />\ncorporate interests that we lose<br />\nour willingness to speak out<br />\nmeaningfully against an evil as<br />\nhuge as apartheid. To the opponents of divestment we ask<br />\nthat you confront the facts (the<br />\nviolence, the polls, the financial<br />\n, studies), try to extend your<br />\nsympathy for human suffering<br />\nmore even-handedly, and try<br />\nexpanding your generosity<br />\nbeyond your immediate community.

It's an enormous<br />\nevent; the entire school gets<br />\ninvolved\u2014and even the Hut<br />\nshuts down for awhile. Of<br />\ncourse, this all had to start<br />\nsomewhere. Andy Savitz, '75,<br />\norganizer and chairman of the<br />\nfirst Spring Fair, explained how<br />\nthey first undertook this major<br />\nevent.<br />\nWhen Savitz first came to<br /><br />\nSpring Fair'86<br />\n3400 On Stage<br />\nHistory<br />\nHopkins,\"...they were kicking the idea around to do<br />\nsomething that would bring the<br />\ncommunity to campus,\" he<br />\nsaid; \"The original intention<br />\nwas not to make money; we<br />\nthought we'd actually lose<br />\nmoney on it.\" He said that no<br />\none was quite sure how the first<br />\nfair would turn out. \"We had<br />\nterrific support from Muller<br />\nand the administration, but<br />\nthere were many uncertainties,\" he said. For starters,<br />\n\"there was at that time a great<br />\nconcern for the physical appearance of the campus,\" said<br />\nSavitz. In addition, he said that<br />\nthe Baltimore City Fair was just<br />\ngetting off the ground at that<br />\ntime, and there was the question of duplication,<br />\nHowever, as Savitz said,<br />\n\"We ran with it. People came<br />\nto the fair, and the next morning the Student Council and the<br />\nfrats were out there picking gar-<br /><br />\na circus one year out on the soccer field ...it still wasn't nearly the size it is now,\" he said.<br />\nBy 1975, he said that the fair<br />\ndrew about 100,000 people. In<br />\naddition, Savitz said that the<br />\nfairs were always held on<br />\nweekends of home lacrosse<br />\ngames. \"It was nice, because all<br />\nthe people from the community were,out at the fair, and all<br />\nthe Hopkins people were at the<br />\nlax game...it was like a fair<br />\nwithin a fair,\" he said.<br />\nUntil recent years, beer consumption was not restricted to<br />\na beer garden. However, \"Alcohol was not a big part of the<br />\nfair; it was a community<br />\nevent,\" said Savitz. He said the<br />\nfair was and is great for<br />\nHopkins because \"it gives peopie a chance to do their own<br />\nthing.\" There was a lot of support and participation from.<br />\neveryone, from the frats to the<br />\nadministration. \"The frats used to put up all the snow fencing for us,\" he said.<br />\nSavitz deserves credit for<br />\nstarting Hopkins off on one terrific tradition. However, he insists that it was no one person's<br />\nidea. \"I just structured itl<br />\nsimilar to a fair that had been<br />\nheld at my high school.\" Savitz<br />\nsaid, \"It was everyone's<br />\nidea...an organic thing that<br />\njust grew very quickly.\"<br />\nSavitz was at first impressed<br />\nthat even the Hut is now ternporarily closed because of<br />\nSpring Fair, but then recalled a<br />\nreception that was held there<br />\nduring the first fair. He said, \"I<br />\nwas in this barbershop quartet,<br />\nand we went into the Hut and<br />\nstarted singing, but some peoplc kept right on studying.\"<br /><br />\nAuto<br />\nShow<br />\nWill Be<br />\nAt Fair<br />\nSPRING<br /><br />\nFAIR!!<br /><br />\nCourtesy of News and Information<br /><br />\nFood For Thought;<br />\nVendor Recalls Fairs Past<br />\nby Jay Lechintan<br />\n. ..

I don't<br />\nthink there was a lot of pressure<br />\nfrom Warner Bros. to change<br />\ntheir style. On the other hand,<br />\nthere is still self-censorship at<br />\nwhatever level of consciousness. Candy Apple Gray,<br />\nwhich is Husker Du's first major label recording is also their<br />\nmost conventional, by far.<br />\nThis is not to say that the<br />\nquality that made Husker Du so<br />\ndifferent (in this day and age<br /><br />\nanyway), namely their blistering emotionalism, has disappeared. Bob Mould's \"Too Far<br />\nDown\" (\"Nothing's ever real<br />\nuntil it's gone and I might be<br />\ntoo far down\") and \"Hardly<br />\nGetting Over It\"(\"My parents,<br />\nthey just wonder when they<br />\nboth are going to die/and what<br />\ndo I do when they die?\") are<br />\nsome of the most affecting<br />\nsongs ever recorded by the<br />\nband. It's just that instead of<br />\nexpressing the mixture of rage<br />\n(hardcore noise) and melancholia so evident in the past, all<br />\nthe concentration is on the<br />\ndepression\u2014focused into semiacoustic ballads, just like the<br />\nstandard soul-searching song.<br />\nGrant Hart is perhaps the<br />\nbiggest offender. He always did<br />\nwrite catchier songs than Bob<br />\nMould and \"Don't Want to<br />\nKnow if You are Lonely\" is<br />\neasily Husker Du's most commercial song ever, but much of<br />\nwhat he has written on this<br />\nalbum could be heard anytime<br />\non any mediocre AOR radio<br />\nstation anywhere.<br />\nThe other problem with this<br />\nrecord is its length; Husker Du<br />\nused to speed 45 minutes worth<br />\nof songs into 15 minute sets,<br /><br />\nyears ago.

Knopf, Inc.,<br />\n225 pages. $17.95.<br />\nby Howell Sasser<br />\nI find that I approach biographies with a certain amount<br />\nof trepidation. There is always<br />\nthe danger that having gone in<br />\na great admirer of the subject,<br />\nI will be disillusioned to find<br />\nthat yet another of my heroes<br />\nis no more than human. If, on<br />\nthe other hand, the subject<br />\nturns out to be a saint with no<br />\ngreater weakness than excessive<br />\nmodesty, I am left wondering<br />\nwhat this person was fed by his<br />\nor her parents\u2014although a<br />\nmore relevant question might<br />\nbe what the ghost-writer was<br />\nfed by the subject.<br />\nSo, as I began to read Alec<br />\nGuiness' autobiography, Blessings in Disguise, I was equally<br />\nready to find either that he was<br />\ncapable of walking on water or<br />\nthat his favorite leisure time activity was white slavery. Indeed,<br />\nI was prepared to flee at the<br />\nfirst sign of actors' egotism or<br />\nattempts to legitimize questionable past acts.<br />\nThe cover allayed some of<br />\nthese fears before I even opened the book. There was no<br />\nmention of a ghost writer: By<br />\nAlec Guiness... with joe<br />\nschmoe. The subject did his<br />\nown writing, and did so with<br />\nmodesty and clarity. His style<br />\nis even more impressive for the<br />\nfact (found in the book) that his<br /><br />\nformal education lasted only<br />\nthrough high school. A good<br />\neditor undoubtedly had much<br />\nto do with the final product,<br />\nbut it is still a feat to convey the<br />\nexperiences of one's life<br />\nwithout boring the reader with<br />\nminutiae or leaving him or her<br />\nincredulous by failing to hit any<br />\nbut the high points.<br />\nOne is happy to find that<br />\none's heroes are happy as well<br />\n(had I mentioned that Guiness<br />\nis one of my heroes?). At any<br />\nrate, the bulk of his book is<br />\ndevoted to showing his various<br />\nexperiences as they are connected to his various friends.<br />\nThus, one finds one chapter<br />\ndevoted to such famous Drury<br />\nLane actors as Sybil Thorndike,<br />\n\u2022Ernest Milton, and Martita<br />\nHunt. He goes on at great<br />\nlength about Sir Ralph<br />\nRichardson, and there is a very<br />\neffusive chapter revolving<br />\naround Sir John Gielgud. His<br />\npresentation of non-actor<br />\nfriends and acquaintances, such<br />\nas Dame Edith Sitwell and Noel<br />\nCoward, are fresh and interesting in that they are seen<br />\nthrough the filter of someone<br />\nelse's experience. These are not,<br />\nhowever, tell-all exposesin the<br />\nMommy Dearest tradition.<br />\nThe private failings and faults<br />\nof Guiness' friends remain<br />\nprivate. Guiness attempts to<br />\navoid those stories which<br />\nalways build up between<br />\nfriends, but which interest no<br />\none but the parties involved.<br />\nThis is especially important in<br />\nGuiness' situation, i.e., almost<br /><br />\nall the people about whom he<br />\nis writing are dead, leaving only the author himself to vouch<br />\nfor the accuracy of his memory.<br />\nOverlying these episodic<br />\nchapters are subjects presented,<br />\nas the continuing themes of<br />\nGuiness' life: acting, religion,<br />\nand his marriage. The first is<br />\nprimarily concerned with parts<br />\ngotten, parts not gotten, stories<br />\nabout actor/director disagreements, with a few words<br />\nthrown in about theater-in-the<br />\nround. The second deals with<br />\nGuiness' crises of belief and his<br />\neventual reception into the<br />\nRoman Catholic Church. And<br />\nwhile this might be categorized<br />\nas actors' dramatics or the attempt by a practitioner of a<br />\nshallow profession to create the<br />\nillusion of depth, his reading<br />\nlist (Hooker, Bishop Gore, St.<br />\nThomas More) was substantial<br />\nenough. Finally, Guiness admits great devotion to and concern for his wife, although on<br />\nthe whole, he does not say as<br />\nmuch about her specifically as<br />\nhe does about the strength he<br />\nderived from their relationship.<br />\nAs with any work of this<br />\nsort, there is bound to be some<br />\n'material which the author<br />\ndecides is inclispensible, but.<br />\nwhich the reader finds to be of<br />\nmarginal interest. A good work<br />\nis thus distinguished from a bad<br />\none by the quantity of marginal<br />\nmaterial. Blessings is not free<br />\nfrom such stuff: Guiness goes<br />\non at great length about his service in the Navy and about his<br />\nstate of mind upon growing<br /><br />\nlittsSRCS<br />\nR DISCHISI<br />\nold. While each of these subjects might attract some interest, they are not as compelling as accounts of lunch with<br />\nGeorge Bernard Shaw or drinks<br />\nwith Ernest Hemingway.<br />\nIn writing one's life story it<br />\nhelps to have had an interesting<br />\nlife (although to judge from<br /><br />\nsome recent books it does not<br />\nseem to be an absolute necessity). Alec Guiness certainly<br />\nqualifies on this criterion and it<br />\nis more to his credit that he was<br />\nable to communicate not only<br />\nthe events but also his reactions<br />\nto them.<br /><br />\n\"A Searing, Indelible Vision of Our World\"<br />\na<br /><br />\n41040440000i<br />\nRobert Stone's Children of<br />\nChildren of Light<br />\nis fiction with a hard<br />\nLight<br />\nby Robert Stone.<br />\nBurnt-out coked-up<br />\nedge.<br />\nAlfred A.

Fortunately, the supporting cast is driven<br />\nby almost incomprehensible but<br />\nbelievable craziness.

He<br />\nblurts out \"condom\" when he<br />\nmeans \"conundrum\" and<br />\nnever forgives himself.

If she<br />\nbecomes unreal or a parody of<br />\nherself, then everything else just<br />\nmight follow into abstract selfpity.<br />\nBut the novel's power is in its<br />\nability to remain cool. While<br />\nthe characters may wallow in<br />\ntheir problems, the writing does<br />\nnot. In today's self-aware struggle to stay individual, this<br />\nwriting makes the sacrifice of<br />\nnot becoming too involved with<br />\nitself. People cannot function<br />\nin emotional vacuums, but<br />\nwriting can sometimes do with<br />\ncareful control of its narrative.<br />\nIn this case, some readers may<br />\nfind Walker and Verger so<br />\nprecisely depicted as to<br />\ndiscourage sympathy. But they<br />\ndon't really care about<br />\nanybody's sympathy and the<br />\nending dispels any notion that<br />\nthe novel is purely a slick account of a torrid affair.<br />\nSo an entertaining, calm<br />\nglance at our generation is the<br />\nresult.

Of the hundred or so<br />\nbright spots, the brightest was<br />\nthe return of co-captain Del<br />\nDressel. Inspired by a midweek<br />\nprivate pep talk from Zimmerman, Dressel thoroughly controlled the midfield, notched<br />\nfour goals and 2 assists, and<br />\nplayed perhaps his most<br />\nawesome game ever.<br />\n\"Del was a man,\" said the<br />\ncoach, \"I've never seen him<br />\ndominate like he did today.\"<br />\nWhen Dressel, Craig Bubier,<br />\nand Brian Wood are all hot on<br />\nthe same day, no defense the<br />\nworld can stop them, and that's<br />\nexactly what happened against<br />\nCarolina. Bubier scored four<br />\ngoals, all within a 6 minute<br />\nspan, to give him a team high<br />\nof 17 for the year.

The team's<br />\nuniforms were virtually identical, though, and he mistook<br />\nCarolina midfielder James<br />\nKoester for a Blue Jay. The<br />\nresult was an easy Tar Heel<br />\nbreak and a John Szczypinski<br />\ngoal at 9:36.<br />\nCarolina had a good chance<br />\nto take the lead two minutes<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nlater in a man up situation, but<br />\nJones made a couple of nice<br />\nsaves and the Jays, specifically<br />\nBubier, started to roll. First, the<br />\njunior took a pass from Dressel<br />\nwith 1:15 to go in the first<br />\nquarter off a double pick and<br />\nfired home. Next, Jones fed<br />\nMcLam at midfield on a perfect<br />\noutlet pass, and then McLam<br />\nraced into the zone and passed<br />\nto Wood who flicked to Bubier<br /><br />\nHopkins vs. Army<br /><br />\nWhere: Michie Stadium, West Point<br />\nWhen: Saturday, 7:30 p.m.<br />\nCoverage: WJ HU, 88.1 FM, beginning at 7:15 p.m.<br />\nPreview: It seems as if each team can respond to the way<br />\ntheir season is transpiring in two ways. Hopkins,<br />\ncoming off last week's feathering of the Tar Heels,<br />\nlooks like they're in prime playoff form. There's<br />\nalways the chance of a letdown though, especially<br />\nwith mega-games coming up in the next two weeks<br />\nagainst Maryland and Navy.<br />\nArmy had high hopes going into the season and<br />\nwas ranked fifth, but now stands at a mediocre 3-3<br />\nafter getting bombed 12-4 by Navy at home. They<br />\nmay pack it in and just play out the string, or they<br />\nmay go all out against Hopkins in the hopes of<br />\nsalvaging the season.<br />\nThe Cadets are too talented to be taken lightly.<br />\nBob Betchley is an excellent attackman, and Dan<br />\nWilliams is widely considered to be one of the<br />\nNCAA's best defensemen. They're a very physical<br />\nteam and will hit the Jays early, late, and often,<br />\nand they'll also have the home field edge. Despite<br />\nall of this, Hopkins is just too good for them, and<br />\nif Hopkins plays like they did last week, they're<br />\nunbeatable.<br /><br />\nfor an easy goal early in the second period.<br />\nAt 3:23 Bubier and Wood<br />\ncombined again. It started at<br />\nmidfield, where Jon Krome<br />\nkept an errant Blue Jay pass inthe offensive sone by scooping<br />\nthe ball to Wood. Wood then<br />\nran to the center of the field<br />\nand fed to Bubier on the left of<br />\nthe net. Bubier promptly cut to<br />\nthe middle and blasted it in<br />\nfrom about ten yards.<br />\nWithin three minutes, the<br />\ntwo All-America's teamed up<br />\nfor goals two more times and<br />\nessentially put Carolina out of<br />\ncommission. With 10 minutes<br />\nto go in the half, John DeTommaso broke down and passed<br />\nto Wood, who then fed Bubier,<br />\nwho threw in a soft bouncer<br />\nthat Barney Aburn wasn't<br />\nready for. A finesse goal. One<br />\nminute later, Bubier dished to<br />\nWood and Wood fired in a<br />\nbullet from about 15 yards out.<br />\nBefore you could 'say \"Willie<br />\nScroggs,\" a tight game had<br />\nbecome a 6-1 rout. Strangely,<br />\nScroggs never called a timeout<br />\nduring the onslaught and didn't<br />\nchange his lineup much,<br />\nperhaps sensing that there was<br />\nno hope.<br />\nAll he did do was to switch<br />\nhis<br />\ndefensive<br />\naround<br />\nassignments. It quieted Wood<br />\nand Bubier down a bit, but then<br />\neveryone else came alive.<br />\nThe Jays made it 7-1 at 7:26<br />\nof the second quarter as Larry<br />\nLedoyen scored off a pass from<br />\nBruce Chanenchuk. Carolina<br /><br />\ncame back with a Chris<br />\nGalgano score on a man-up<br />\nsituation, but then Del Dressel<br />\ndecided to put on a show.<br />\nHis first goal of the day<br />\nshould have gotten extra points<br />\nfor degree of difficulty. Dressel<br />\npicked up a loose ball about<br />\neight yards or so in front of the<br />\nnet and proceeded to crank in<br />\na rocket, backhanded, while be-<br /><br />\ning knocked off his feet. Aburn<br />\ncould not have possibly even<br />\nseen the shot until it was behind<br />\nhim. His next goal, coming<br />\nwith 18 seconds left in the half,<br />\nwas a bit more ordinary. It was<br />\njust your standard 15 yard,<br />\n1000 m.p.h. shot that made it<br />\n9-2 going into intermission.<br />\nContinued on Page 35<br /><br />\n\"THE JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nTHE PATIO/PAVILLION<br />\nNOON PERFORMANCE<br />\nSERIES<br />\nPresents<br /><br />\nCOMPANY<br />\npresents its<br /><br />\nSPRING CONCERT<br />\n1986<br />\nThursday and Friday, April 17 &amp; 18<br />\n8:00 pm<br />\nShriver Hall, JHU<br />\nadmission: $2.00 students, sr. citizens<br />\n$3.00 general<br /><br />\nOne full hour of classical<br />\nmusic performed on violins<br />\nTUESDAY, APRIL 15<br />\n12:00 - 1:00p.m.<br />\nLEVERING PATIO<br />\nRain site: Glass Pavillion<br />\nSPONSORED BY THE<br />\nHOPKINS UNION<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/35<br /><br />\nBabb's Bombers Keep On Blasting Away<br />\nContinued from Page 31<br />\nthird and adding 2 more RBI's<br />\nin the fourth.
