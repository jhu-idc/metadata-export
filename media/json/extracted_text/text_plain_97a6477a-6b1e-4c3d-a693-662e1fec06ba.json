The leading article, we fear, has<br />\nbeen almost as often passed over as read by<br />\nthe average reader; and sometimes not without a certain amount of reason. Good leading articles are as rare as poor ones are plentiful, and not infrequently the editors have<br />\nbeen forced in spite of themselves to use inferior matter. For these reasons, and others,<br />\nwe have thought it wiser to declare our entire independence of the exasperating \"leader.\" Whenever we are able to obtain an<br />\narticle of real value, we will use it in the<br />\nbody of the paper. The beginning will remain in the present form. The alteration<br />\nwill give more space for original matter, and<br />\nthis advantage, together with the fact that<br />\nwith their change in place the editorials have<br />\nalso experienced a certain change in character, will, we hope, cause our patrons to<br />\nview the innovation with as much favor as<br />\nwe do ourselves.<br />\n<br />\nD<br />\n<br />\nN our last issue was published what we<br />\nwere pleased to call a \"Baseball Obituary,\" and some few misguided souls<br />\nseem to have misunderstood us. By this<br />\ntitle we did not mean to imply no resurrection. In fact, we look and hope for it. Some<br />\nsay we anticipated somewhat. Maybe we<br />\ndid. We hope so; and we are hoping, too,<br />\nthat the team may win the rest of the games<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\non its schedule and finish the season with a<br />\nflourish. In any event, baseball should not<br />\nbe abandoned any more than should the lacrosse team lose the support of the Athletic<br />\nBoard because it failed to win the Harvard<br />\ngame. We are not in favor of throwing over<br />\nthe Jonahs even though we have biblical<br />\nbacking for it. But we can criticise, and<br />\nwe are going to criticise baseball or any other<br />\nform of athletics whenever we think the occasion demands it\u2014and we intend to criticise in the same spirit that a man criticises<br />\nthe faults of his best friends. It must be<br />\nremembered that it is the perogative, and the<br />\nduty, too, of the College paper either to criticise or praise, as the situation may require.<br />\nT is a regrettable fact, that the recent<br />\nconcert of the Musical Clubs was\u2014at<br />\nleast financially\u2014a distinct failure; the<br />\nmore so, as this failure was due entirely<br />\nto poor attendance on the part of the undergraduates. Hardly any admission seats<br />\nwere sold, and the rear quarter of the hall<br />\nwas absolutely desolate. It rained, to be<br />\nsure, but this is no excuse; only one concert<br />\nis given each year, and it is the duty of every<br />\nstudent to attend. This year, however,<br />\nthe delinquents will have a chance to atone,<br />\nas another concert will be given towards the<br />\nend of the month, for the benefit of the Athletic Association. The success of this concert will depend entirely on the attendance,<br />\nand it is \"up to\" every undergraduate to<br />\nassist, as far as possible, by coming to the<br />\nconcert himself, and by bringing his friends<br />\nwith him.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nNEW and, hitherto an almost unheard<br />\nof disease, has germinated within the<br />\nwalls of this University. Whether<br />\nthe germs found their nuclei in the silent<br />\ncorners of the Physical Lab, or in the stilly<br />\nblackness of the gymnasium coal-hole, has<br />\nnot been ascertained. Certain it is, however, that this new disease is here, and, while<br />\nby no means incurable, is slowly but surely<br />\nspreading its repulsive influence among us,<br />\nespecially attacking all forms of athletics.<br />\nScientifically, this disease might be classified<br />\nas \"Nitibus Yellibus\" or \"absence of yelling.\" In all its obnoxiousness, it makes itself apparent at athletic games, and is lamented by both players and spectators. The<br />\nfact that it has hitherto seldom made its appearance here, and never at universities of<br />\nequal rank, has been owing to a generous use<br />\nof that splendid preventative known as<br />\n\"Systematic Organization of Rooters.\"<br />\nHowever, it is not too late even to use<br />\nthis medicine as a curative, and certainly it<br />\nshould be used next year. Let's get together, Rooters! Let's organize and help our<br />\nteams win!<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nITH the advent of summer, ushering<br />\nin her gifts to Dame Nature, and<br />\nprotecting them with a mantle far<br />\ntoo warm for less poetical subjects, the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER board begins to dream of the<br />\nshady nooks and babbling brooks at Homewood. How much greater would be the inspiration to study during hot weather, if<br />\nour class-rooms looked out upon green meadows and inviting woods, instead of upon<br />\ncobble-stones and back yards. With what<br />\nrenewed vigor would our teams report for<br />\npractice, if they could work on a broad<br />\nlevel field, that did not lie two or three<br />\nmiles away from the gym. These are a few<br />\nof the advantages which Homewood promises. May our children enjoy them!<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\nthe finances of the clubs; for are not those<br />\nwho intend to return next year really the<br />\nmost interested in the choice of a new manager? The present management is eminently<br />\nfitted to exercise wise judgment, but all<br />\nthe musical men who have been asked for<br />\nan opinion have agreed with the NEwsLETTER that the democratic idea should prevail, and that an election should be held.<br />\nHE attention of the NEws-LETTER has<br />\nbeen called to a crying need<br />\nof the University.<br />\nThis want<br />\nmay seem at first sight to be trivial,<br />\nbut the News-LETTER is not joking,<br />\nand does not treat of trivialities. The cry<br />\nwhich we have heard from all sides is for<br />\nchairs in the basement. Those of the men<br />\nwho are fond of social intercourse and are<br />\nnot buried under a load of books, say \"Give<br />\nus chairs.\" The Trophy Room is of some<br />\nuse, but it cannot take the place of the basement and Garden Stre\u2014, or rather, Linden<br />\nAvenue. If library chairs are broken the<br />\ninvariably remain, for a short period, in the<br />\nbasement; but a chair-smashing brigade cannot be recommended by a respectable and<br />\nlaw-abiding paper such as the NEws-LETTER,<br />\nespecially as the results of such a violent<br />\ncourse would probably not be entirely successful. Let us rack our brains to find a<br />\nsolution of the problem.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nERILY, a prophet is not without honor<br />\nsave in his own country. The truth<br />\nof this old proverb was forcefully<br />\nimpressed upon us recently upon seeing a<br />\ncopy of the Providence Telegram, dated<br />\nApril 9, the day after the debate with<br />\nBrown.<br />\nOccupying a central position on one of the<br />\nmost prominent pages appeareed the pictures<br />\nof the Hopkins and Brown debating teams.<br />\nThe pictures stretched across three columns<br />\nand extended about one-third down the page.<br />\nS with Caesar in \"hither Gaul,\" ru- Below the illustrations, in scare headlines<br />\nmors have been brought to us that such as our conservative Baltimore dailies<br />\nthe manager of the Musical Clubs for would use only in case Togo Annihilates<br />\nnext year is to be chosen by the present Rojestvensky or President Roosevelt Shoots a<br />\nmanagement. The leaders of the several Bear, it was announced that \"Brown Loses<br />\ndubs are best able to choose their successors Big Debate.\" After a succession of smaller<br />\nin office, but even in their case some might head-lines, there followed a telegraphic acconsider an election the better method. Cer- count of the contest, including extracts from<br />\ntainly, in the opinion of the NEws-LETTER, several of the speeches. Collectively, the<br />\nthe men should have some influence in the accounts in the Baltimore papers devoted<br />\nchoice of the one who is to have charge of perhaps one-half the space to the debate in-<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nPUCK<br />\nEDITORIAL ROOMS,<br />\n<br />\nSTANLEY MEADE, REYNOLDS,<br />\n<br />\nNew York, May 5th, 1905.<br />\n<br />\nJohns llopkins University,<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nMy Dear Sirs:<br />\nI always take the keenest pleasure in throwing up my hands in the face of such<br />\ncharming literary highwaymen as you show yourself to be in your favor of May 1st.<br />\nI am also delighted with the range of subjects which you place at my disposal and<br />\nwhich seem to be even broader than the Erope of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica, the<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCentury Dictionary and Cruden's Concordance rolled into one. Taking advantage of<br />\nthis broad and liberal spirit, which by th way, I do not find surprising in an under<br />\n\u2022 or an over graduate of Johns Hopkins, I h.ive derived much pleasure from dictating<br />\nthe enclosed sonnet, entitled \"Sense,\" which I dedicate to yourself and your board<br />\nof Editors. I trust the thought of the sonnet will appeal to you and that its meaning<br />\nwill clearly reveal itself to the philosophic minds by which you are surrounded.

I do not enclose postage for its return for<br />\nI am quite aware if it does not prove satisfactory at Johns Hopkins, it is not likely<br />\nto find the appreciation I seek for it in any other quarter.

It was proposed by men who have in<br />\nthe past proved by deeds their devotion to<br />\nJohns Hopkins athletics; and it was in deference to these men, rather than from any desire on our part to have the NEw-LETTER<br />\nassume the role of a reformer, that the plan<br />\nwas made public. Since the publication of<br />\nthe matter, however, we have been greeted<br />\nwith such a volume of interested query, and<br />\nhave been made the recipients of so many<br />\nfavorable criticisms of the scheme, accompanied by requests to \"push the matter,\"<br />\nthat we feel justified in bringing the subject<br />\nagain before the public in a fuller and more<br />\nserious manner.<br />\nThe plan, in brief, is as follows:<br />\nThat at the beginning of the year, upon payment of five dollars, each student shall receive<br />\na card entitling him to admission. to every<br />\ngame played by a Hopkins team throughout<br />\nthe year; and that the money 80 received shall<br />\nbe divided among the various teams in such<br />\nproportion as the Athletic Association or the<br />\nmanagers of the teams shall decide upon.<br />\nA proposal which involves the interests of<br />\ntwo distinct classes, the athletic teams and<br />\nthe general student body, must be considered<br />\nfrom the standpoint of each. From the<br />\npoint of view of the students, the advantages<br />\nof the plan are almost too manifest to require comment. Few attendants upon the<br />\nUniversity, however indifferent to athletics<br />\nthey may be, spend less than five dollars<br />\nupon admission to games. The normal student spends fully this much, and then sees<br />\nless than half the contests. To the loyal<br />\nlittle band who make a point of attending<br />\nevery game, the expense of a season's ticket<br />\nis no inconsiderable item in the total cost of<br />\nliving.<br />\nBesides, the students have a right to a cer-<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\ntain amount of consideration. The teams.<br />\nbelong to them. They are recruited from<br />\ntheir ranks, are managed by their classmates, contest under the common name of<br />\nthe University, and, finally, are largely supported by the funds obtained through student taxation (the yearly locker-fee). So<br />\nlong as the students at large are placed upon<br />\nthe same terms as the outside public, managers of teams have no grounds upon which<br />\nto complain of lack of student support. Of<br />\ncourse, college spirit should count for a great<br />\ndeal, but, at best, it's a poor rule that won't<br />\nwork both ways.<br />\nThe advantages which would accrue to<br />\nthe teams from the operation of the plan<br />\nwould be even greater. The lack of student<br />\nattendance at games has become an open<br />\nshame.<br />\nOnly twice this spring, at the<br />\nPrinceton and the Mt. Washington games,<br />\nhas there been anything worthy of the term<br />\n\"rooting.\" At the Stevens game we were<br />\nout-yelled on our own grounds by men who<br />\nhad come all the way from Hoboken, N. J.<br />\nThe season ticket plan, we believe, will at<br />\nonce remove all excuse for absence from<br />\ngames, and at the same time provide an additional incentive to come. It's a psychological fact that when a man has a ticket in<br />\nhis pocket to something for which others<br />\nare paying, he is very apt to use it; and that<br />\nis putting the matter on the lowest possible<br />\nmotives.<br />\nFurthermore, the teams would lose no<br />\nmoney by the plan. On the other hand, their<br />\nnet incomes would probably be larger. If<br />\nevery student pays for a ticket, almost $4,000<br />\nwould result. The proceeds from students<br />\nalone fall at present considerably below this<br />\nfigure. Besides, an increased student attendance would produce an increased attendance of outsiders. Nothing draws a crowd<br />\nto a game so surely as the knowledge that<br />\nother people are going; and if we show no'<br />\ninterest in our own sports, how can we expect the public to do so?<br />\nFinally, is the plan practicable<br />\nIt has<br />\nbeen introduced with uniform success in<br />\nmany Other colleges. The perfection of the<br />\nscheme would be, of course, for the tickets<br />\nto be sold by the University authorities as a<br />\npart of the regular expenses. Such, we un-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nderstand, is the system in use at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Conference \u2022<br />\nwith those in authority here, however,<br />\nleads us to believe that it is more<br />\nthan dm dant if the trustees would<br />\nconsent to such an arrangement. We<br />\nare confident, though, that it would be sufficient for the Athletic Association to place<br />\nthe tickets on sale. The manifest economy<br />\nof the season ticket would be enough to<br />\ncause the great majority of students to purchase one, while the power of public opinion<br />\nwould force most of the poorer-spirited<br />\nwaverers to similar action.<br />\nWe have suggested five dollars as the price<br />\nof the ticket. This is an outside valuation<br />\ncalculated to insure being on the safe side.<br />\nShould all the students show a readiness to<br />\npurchase, the cost per ticket could be reduced considerably\u2014perhaps to as low a figure as three dollars. The plan is not primarily<br />\nintended to make money. That is incidental.<br />\nA suggestion which we have frequently<br />\nreceived is that the right to purchase tickets<br />\nat the same rate be extended to the alumni.<br />\nThe idea seems to us a good one, and we have<br />\nnot included it in our statement of the plan<br />\nsimply because we believe it should be more<br />\nthoroughly looked into first. This matter,<br />\nas well as the possible reduction in the price<br />\nof the tickets, may well be left to the wisdom of the Athletic Association, with whom<br />\nthe whole question ultimately rests.<br />\nFollowing are some of the opinions expressed by men who are, or who have been<br />\nin the past, prominent in Johns Hopkins<br />\nathletics:<br />\nDr. Edward Renouf, faculty delegate to<br />\nthe Athletic Association:<br />\nThe plan of season tickets for students admitting to all games at moderate price seems<br />\ndesirable and feasible. If the students interested will make a general and determined effort<br />\nto rouse others at the beginning of the year, I<br />\nbelieve it would lead nearly all undergraduate<br />\nand many graduates to purchase such tickets.<br />\nIt seems the only way to overcome the deplorable lack of attendance of the majority of the<br />\nstudent body at our best home games.<br />\nDr. C. It MacInnes:\u2014The present attendance of students upon athletic games is so poor<br />\nthat it ,could hardly be worse. The plan urged<br />\nby the Aws-IATITR seems a wise way in which,<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nto attack the evil. I am heartily in favor of<br />\nthe movement.<br />\nHenry P. Straus, president Athletic Association:\u2014A committee of the student body<br />\nshould be appointed to push the matter vigorously. I also think it would be wise to offer the<br />\nsame advantage to the alumni.<br />\nH. W. Plaggemeyer, president Athletic Association, 1903-04:\u2014The absence of rooting at<br />\ngames this year has been a disgrace. When I<br />\nwas an Undergrad, almost the entire undergraduate body used to turn out to every game, and<br />\nwhen the contest was over march to the cage in<br />\na long parade, following the 'bus containing<br />\nthe players. The plan advocated by the NIVVSLETTF,R would, I believe, remedy the evil, and<br />\nalso result in a greater revenue for the Athletic<br />\nAssociation, for the larger the attendance of<br />\nstudents, the larger will be the attendance of<br />\nthe fairer sex.<br />\nF. C. Blanck<br />\nam willing to give the plan<br />\nmy heartiest support. Such a system is in use<br />\nat Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and<br />\nmost of the larger colleges.

The<br />\nmanagers and captains should be glad of such<br />\na means of increasing the \"rooting\" attendance<br />\nat the games. The few difficulties that may<br />\nseem to stand in the way, can be easily overcome. .<br />\nH. N. Holmes, captain basket ball team,<br />\n1905:\u2014The season ticket idea is a good one<br />\nwhich can certainly do no harm and which cannot fail to increase student interest in athletics.<br />\nA slightly lower rate might be acceptable to a<br />\ngreater number of students, but the plan is excellent as it stands.<br />\nJ.

The Lehigh defense was always hi the right place at critical moments and always succeded in checking our attacks' tries at goal. It was only<br />\nafter seven and a half minutes of hard play<br />\nthat Strobhar was able to make the first gaal,<br />\nand then it took at least fifteen minutes more<br />\nfor Knipp to break through Lehigh's close<br />\ndefense to shoot the second. This was the<br />\nlast score made in the half, and it looked<br />\nas though we would be able to shut the<br />\nvisitors out in the second half, but in this<br />\nrespect we were sadly disappointed.<br />\nWhen the second half began we found<br />\nthat what we had to do was not to shut Lehigh out, but that we had to work to keep<br />\nfrom being shut out ourselves. Lehigh began the half with a rush, and as the Hopkins<br />\ndefense was playing rather loosely, Harrower<br />\nsoon penetrated it for Lehigh's first goal.<br />\nAnd a few minutes later, De Schweinitz<br />\npassed the rubber in the net for the visitor's<br />\nsecond goal. This tied the score, and Hopkins realized that it was up to her to play<br />\na little steadier game.<br />\nAs a result of this realization, the ball was<br />\nkept in Lehigh's territory most of the time,<br />\nbut time and time again we were kept from<br />\nscoring by the brilliant stops made by the<br />\nLehigh goal tend. Finally, after 20 minutes<br />\nof such play, Strobhar was able to shoot the<br />\nthird goal and a few minutes later followed<br />\nit with a fourth. The game was now safe,<br />\nand the remainder of the half was spent in<br />\nkeeping Lehigh from scoring.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS, 2; MT. WASHINGTON 2.<br />\n<br />\nBefore a large crowd of enthusiastic spectators, Hopkins and Mount Washington<br />\nplayed a strong fast game ending in a tie2 to 2. Among the onlookers were many<br />\nladies, both relatives and friends of the players, and many a mother was there to witness<br />\nthe prowess of her Willie or Freddie or whatever the name might be.<br />\nThe game was very interesting and the<br />\nplay was very clean, hardly any rough or<br />\nfoul play being noted. Hopkins furnished<br />\na large majority of the participators, as there<br />\nwere three old Hopkins men on the Mount<br />\nWashington team, and the referee was Abercrombie, an old Hopkins star.<br />\nOur men started with a rush and a goal<br />\nwas scored by Erlanger within one minute of<br />\nthe start. The next goal took longer, but<br />\nDill managed to negotiate the deed, receiving the ball on a long pass from Strobhar.<br />\nPutts, in-home for Mt. Washington, started<br />\nthe scoring for his team by a difficult shot.<br />\nThe next goal was out of the ordinary. The<br />\nball, after a shot at goal, bounded high in<br />\nthe air and before the Hopkins defense could<br />\ncatch it and toss it out of danger, the Mt.<br />\nWashington attack rushed the players, ball<br />\nand all, pell-mell into the net.<br />\nThe second half was hard fought but no<br />\nSeveral times Hopkins<br />\nscoring resulted.<br />\nhad chances for shots but the men seemed<br />\nnervous and the ball went wide.

The effort now is<br />\nto secure a common practice of instructors,<br />\nwhere none has heretofore prevailed.<br />\nThere are two promising Japanese candidates at Pennsylvania University for places<br />\nin the varsity baseball team.<br />\n<br />\nA Yale graduate has offered a prize of<br />\n$100 for the best essay on Edgar Allan Poe.<br />\nIn spite of an increase of 13 per cent, in<br />\nstudent attendance within the last year, the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania is beginning to<br />\nexperience the same difficulty as Harvard and<br />\nYale in making its fixed- income and gifts<br />\nmeet the running expenses.<br />\nBy careful economy, it seems possible to<br />\nkeep the strictly necessary expenses for an<br />\nacademic year at Harvard down to about<br />\n$4100.<br />\n<br />\nPresident Wilson announces that fifty<br />\nteachers are to be added to the Princeton<br />\nTen of the seventeen students chosen from<br />\nfaculty next fall, to put into operation the<br />\ndifferent<br />\nprovinces of the Argentine Repubprojected preceptorial system, for which the<br />\nlic<br />\nand<br />\nsent<br />\nto American colleges at the exalumni are raising a fund of $2,500,000.

The leading article, we fear, has<br />\nbeen almost as often passed over as read by<br />\nthe average reader; and sometimes not without a certain amount of reason. Good leading articles are as rare as poor ones are plentiful, and not infrequently the editors have<br />\nbeen forced in spite of themselves to use inferior matter. For these reasons, and others,<br />\nwe have thought it wiser to declare our entire independence of the exasperating \"leader.\" Whenever we are able to obtain an<br />\narticle of real value, we will use it in the<br />\nbody of the paper. The beginning will remain in the present form. The alteration<br />\nwill give more space for original matter, and<br />\nthis advantage, together with the fact that<br />\nwith their change in place the editorials have<br />\nalso experienced a certain change in character, will, we hope, cause our patrons to<br />\nview the innovation with as much favor as<br />\nwe do ourselves.<br /><br />\nD<br /><br />\nN our last issue was published what we<br />\nwere pleased to call a \"Baseball Obituary,\" and some few misguided souls<br />\nseem to have misunderstood us. By this<br />\ntitle we did not mean to imply no resurrection. In fact, we look and hope for it. Some<br />\nsay we anticipated somewhat. Maybe we<br />\ndid. We hope so; and we are hoping, too,<br />\nthat the team may win the rest of the games<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\non its schedule and finish the season with a<br />\nflourish. In any event, baseball should not<br />\nbe abandoned any more than should the lacrosse team lose the support of the Athletic<br />\nBoard because it failed to win the Harvard<br />\ngame. We are not in favor of throwing over<br />\nthe Jonahs even though we have biblical<br />\nbacking for it. But we can criticise, and<br />\nwe are going to criticise baseball or any other<br />\nform of athletics whenever we think the occasion demands it\u2014and we intend to criticise in the same spirit that a man criticises<br />\nthe faults of his best friends. It must be<br />\nremembered that it is the perogative, and the<br />\nduty, too, of the College paper either to criticise or praise, as the situation may require.<br />\nT is a regrettable fact, that the recent<br />\nconcert of the Musical Clubs was\u2014at<br />\nleast financially\u2014a distinct failure; the<br />\nmore so, as this failure was due entirely<br />\nto poor attendance on the part of the undergraduates. Hardly any admission seats<br />\nwere sold, and the rear quarter of the hall<br />\nwas absolutely desolate. It rained, to be<br />\nsure, but this is no excuse; only one concert<br />\nis given each year, and it is the duty of every<br />\nstudent to attend. This year, however,<br />\nthe delinquents will have a chance to atone,<br />\nas another concert will be given towards the<br />\nend of the month, for the benefit of the Athletic Association. The success of this concert will depend entirely on the attendance,<br />\nand it is \"up to\" every undergraduate to<br />\nassist, as far as possible, by coming to the<br />\nconcert himself, and by bringing his friends<br />\nwith him.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nNEW and, hitherto an almost unheard<br />\nof disease, has germinated within the<br />\nwalls of this University. Whether<br />\nthe germs found their nuclei in the silent<br />\ncorners of the Physical Lab, or in the stilly<br />\nblackness of the gymnasium coal-hole, has<br />\nnot been ascertained. Certain it is, however, that this new disease is here, and, while<br />\nby no means incurable, is slowly but surely<br />\nspreading its repulsive influence among us,<br />\nespecially attacking all forms of athletics.<br />\nScientifically, this disease might be classified<br />\nas \"Nitibus Yellibus\" or \"absence of yelling.\" In all its obnoxiousness, it makes itself apparent at athletic games, and is lamented by both players and spectators. The<br />\nfact that it has hitherto seldom made its appearance here, and never at universities of<br />\nequal rank, has been owing to a generous use<br />\nof that splendid preventative known as<br />\n\"Systematic Organization of Rooters.\"<br />\nHowever, it is not too late even to use<br />\nthis medicine as a curative, and certainly it<br />\nshould be used next year. Let's get together, Rooters! Let's organize and help our<br />\nteams win!<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nITH the advent of summer, ushering<br />\nin her gifts to Dame Nature, and<br />\nprotecting them with a mantle far<br />\ntoo warm for less poetical subjects, the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER board begins to dream of the<br />\nshady nooks and babbling brooks at Homewood. How much greater would be the inspiration to study during hot weather, if<br />\nour class-rooms looked out upon green meadows and inviting woods, instead of upon<br />\ncobble-stones and back yards. With what<br />\nrenewed vigor would our teams report for<br />\npractice, if they could work on a broad<br />\nlevel field, that did not lie two or three<br />\nmiles away from the gym. These are a few<br />\nof the advantages which Homewood promises. May our children enjoy them!<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\nthe finances of the clubs; for are not those<br />\nwho intend to return next year really the<br />\nmost interested in the choice of a new manager? The present management is eminently<br />\nfitted to exercise wise judgment, but all<br />\nthe musical men who have been asked for<br />\nan opinion have agreed with the NEwsLETTER that the democratic idea should prevail, and that an election should be held.<br />\nHE attention of the NEws-LETTER has<br />\nbeen called to a crying need<br />\nof the University.<br />\nThis want<br />\nmay seem at first sight to be trivial,<br />\nbut the News-LETTER is not joking,<br />\nand does not treat of trivialities. The cry<br />\nwhich we have heard from all sides is for<br />\nchairs in the basement. Those of the men<br />\nwho are fond of social intercourse and are<br />\nnot buried under a load of books, say \"Give<br />\nus chairs.\" The Trophy Room is of some<br />\nuse, but it cannot take the place of the basement and Garden Stre\u2014, or rather, Linden<br />\nAvenue. If library chairs are broken the<br />\ninvariably remain, for a short period, in the<br />\nbasement; but a chair-smashing brigade cannot be recommended by a respectable and<br />\nlaw-abiding paper such as the NEws-LETTER,<br />\nespecially as the results of such a violent<br />\ncourse would probably not be entirely successful. Let us rack our brains to find a<br />\nsolution of the problem.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nERILY, a prophet is not without honor<br />\nsave in his own country. The truth<br />\nof this old proverb was forcefully<br />\nimpressed upon us recently upon seeing a<br />\ncopy of the Providence Telegram, dated<br />\nApril 9, the day after the debate with<br />\nBrown.<br />\nOccupying a central position on one of the<br />\nmost prominent pages appeareed the pictures<br />\nof the Hopkins and Brown debating teams.<br />\nThe pictures stretched across three columns<br />\nand extended about one-third down the page.<br />\nS with Caesar in \"hither Gaul,\" ru- Below the illustrations, in scare headlines<br />\nmors have been brought to us that such as our conservative Baltimore dailies<br />\nthe manager of the Musical Clubs for would use only in case Togo Annihilates<br />\nnext year is to be chosen by the present Rojestvensky or President Roosevelt Shoots a<br />\nmanagement. The leaders of the several Bear, it was announced that \"Brown Loses<br />\ndubs are best able to choose their successors Big Debate.\" After a succession of smaller<br />\nin office, but even in their case some might head-lines, there followed a telegraphic acconsider an election the better method.

It was proposed by men who have in<br />\nthe past proved by deeds their devotion to<br />\nJohns Hopkins athletics; and it was in deference to these men, rather than from any desire on our part to have the NEw-LETTER<br />\nassume the role of a reformer, that the plan<br />\nwas made public. Since the publication of<br />\nthe matter, however, we have been greeted<br />\nwith such a volume of interested query, and<br />\nhave been made the recipients of so many<br />\nfavorable criticisms of the scheme, accompanied by requests to \"push the matter,\"<br />\nthat we feel justified in bringing the subject<br />\nagain before the public in a fuller and more<br />\nserious manner.<br />\nThe plan, in brief, is as follows:<br />\nThat at the beginning of the year, upon payment of five dollars, each student shall receive<br />\na card entitling him to admission. to every<br />\ngame played by a Hopkins team throughout<br />\nthe year; and that the money 80 received shall<br />\nbe divided among the various teams in such<br />\nproportion as the Athletic Association or the<br />\nmanagers of the teams shall decide upon.<br />\nA proposal which involves the interests of<br />\ntwo distinct classes, the athletic teams and<br />\nthe general student body, must be considered<br />\nfrom the standpoint of each. From the<br />\npoint of view of the students, the advantages<br />\nof the plan are almost too manifest to require comment. Few attendants upon the<br />\nUniversity, however indifferent to athletics<br />\nthey may be, spend less than five dollars<br />\nupon admission to games. The normal student spends fully this much, and then sees<br />\nless than half the contests. To the loyal<br />\nlittle band who make a point of attending<br />\nevery game, the expense of a season's ticket<br />\nis no inconsiderable item in the total cost of<br />\nliving.<br />\nBesides, the students have a right to a cer-<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\ntain amount of consideration. The teams.<br />\nbelong to them. They are recruited from<br />\ntheir ranks, are managed by their classmates, contest under the common name of<br />\nthe University, and, finally, are largely supported by the funds obtained through student taxation (the yearly locker-fee). So<br />\nlong as the students at large are placed upon<br />\nthe same terms as the outside public, managers of teams have no grounds upon which<br />\nto complain of lack of student support. Of<br />\ncourse, college spirit should count for a great<br />\ndeal, but, at best, it's a poor rule that won't<br />\nwork both ways.<br />\nThe advantages which would accrue to<br />\nthe teams from the operation of the plan<br />\nwould be even greater. The lack of student<br />\nattendance at games has become an open<br />\nshame.<br />\nOnly twice this spring, at the<br />\nPrinceton and the Mt. Washington games,<br />\nhas there been anything worthy of the term<br />\n\"rooting.\" At the Stevens game we were<br />\nout-yelled on our own grounds by men who<br />\nhad come all the way from Hoboken, N. J.<br />\nThe season ticket plan, we believe, will at<br />\nonce remove all excuse for absence from<br />\ngames, and at the same time provide an additional incentive to come. It's a psychological fact that when a man has a ticket in<br />\nhis pocket to something for which others<br />\nare paying, he is very apt to use it; and that<br />\nis putting the matter on the lowest possible<br />\nmotives.<br />\nFurthermore, the teams would lose no<br />\nmoney by the plan. On the other hand, their<br />\nnet incomes would probably be larger. If<br />\nevery student pays for a ticket, almost $4,000<br />\nwould result. The proceeds from students<br />\nalone fall at present considerably below this<br />\nfigure. Besides, an increased student attendance would produce an increased attendance of outsiders. Nothing draws a crowd<br />\nto a game so surely as the knowledge that<br />\nother people are going; and if we show no'<br />\ninterest in our own sports, how can we expect the public to do so?<br />\nFinally, is the plan practicable<br />\nIt has<br />\nbeen introduced with uniform success in<br />\nmany Other colleges. The perfection of the<br />\nscheme would be, of course, for the tickets<br />\nto be sold by the University authorities as a<br />\npart of the regular expenses. Such, we un-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nderstand, is the system in use at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Conference \u2022<br />\nwith those in authority here, however,<br />\nleads us to believe that it is more<br />\nthan dm dant if the trustees would<br />\nconsent to such an arrangement. We<br />\nare confident, though, that it would be sufficient for the Athletic Association to place<br />\nthe tickets on sale. The manifest economy<br />\nof the season ticket would be enough to<br />\ncause the great majority of students to purchase one, while the power of public opinion<br />\nwould force most of the poorer-spirited<br />\nwaverers to similar action.<br />\nWe have suggested five dollars as the price<br />\nof the ticket. This is an outside valuation<br />\ncalculated to insure being on the safe side.<br />\nShould all the students show a readiness to<br />\npurchase, the cost per ticket could be reduced considerably\u2014perhaps to as low a figure as three dollars. The plan is not primarily<br />\nintended to make money. That is incidental.<br />\nA suggestion which we have frequently<br />\nreceived is that the right to purchase tickets<br />\nat the same rate be extended to the alumni.<br />\nThe idea seems to us a good one, and we have<br />\nnot included it in our statement of the plan<br />\nsimply because we believe it should be more<br />\nthoroughly looked into first. This matter,<br />\nas well as the possible reduction in the price<br />\nof the tickets, may well be left to the wisdom of the Athletic Association, with whom<br />\nthe whole question ultimately rests.<br />\nFollowing are some of the opinions expressed by men who are, or who have been<br />\nin the past, prominent in Johns Hopkins<br />\nathletics:<br />\nDr. Edward Renouf, faculty delegate to<br />\nthe Athletic Association:<br />\nThe plan of season tickets for students admitting to all games at moderate price seems<br />\ndesirable and feasible. If the students interested will make a general and determined effort<br />\nto rouse others at the beginning of the year, I<br />\nbelieve it would lead nearly all undergraduate<br />\nand many graduates to purchase such tickets.<br />\nIt seems the only way to overcome the deplorable lack of attendance of the majority of the<br />\nstudent body at our best home games.<br />\nDr. C. It MacInnes:\u2014The present attendance of students upon athletic games is so poor<br />\nthat it ,could hardly be worse. The plan urged<br />\nby the Aws-IATITR seems a wise way in which,<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nto attack the evil. I am heartily in favor of<br />\nthe movement.<br />\nHenry P. Straus, president Athletic Association:\u2014A committee of the student body<br />\nshould be appointed to push the matter vigorously. I also think it would be wise to offer the<br />\nsame advantage to the alumni.<br />\nH. W. Plaggemeyer, president Athletic Association, 1903-04:\u2014The absence of rooting at<br />\ngames this year has been a disgrace. When I<br />\nwas an Undergrad, almost the entire undergraduate body used to turn out to every game, and<br />\nwhen the contest was over march to the cage in<br />\na long parade, following the 'bus containing<br />\nthe players. The plan advocated by the NIVVSLETTF,R would, I believe, remedy the evil, and<br />\nalso result in a greater revenue for the Athletic<br />\nAssociation, for the larger the attendance of<br />\nstudents, the larger will be the attendance of<br />\nthe fairer sex.<br />\nF. C. Blanck<br />\nam willing to give the plan<br />\nmy heartiest support. Such a system is in use<br />\nat Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and<br />\nmost of the larger colleges. At both these universities, by the way, the assessment for tickets<br />\nis five dolars.<br />\nSifford Pearre, captain football team, 1904:<br />\nI am heartily in favor of the movement. A<br />\nsimilar plan has proved very successful at the<br />\nMt. Washington Athletic Club.<br />\nW. II. Straughn, manager football team, 1904,<br />\nand basket ball team 19051\u2014The idea is an excellent one which would make for the good of<br />\nall classes. It should be pushed to a successful<br />\nconclusion.<br />\nJohn A. Addison, manager lacrosse team,<br />\n1902-03:\u2014The Athletic Association has long<br />\nowed something like this to its members. The<br />\nmanagers and captains should be glad of such<br />\na means of increasing the \"rooting\" attendance<br />\nat the games. The few difficulties that may<br />\nseem to stand in the way, can be easily overcome. .<br />\nH. N. Holmes, captain basket ball team,<br />\n1905:\u2014The season ticket idea is a good one<br />\nwhich can certainly do no harm and which cannot fail to increase student interest in athletics.<br />\nA slightly lower rate might be acceptable to a<br />\ngreater number of students, but the plan is excellent as it stands.<br />\nJ. Earle Mifflin, manager lacrosse team, 1905:<br />\nI believe the plan is a wise one.

The Lehigh defense was always hi the right place at critical moments and always succeded in checking our attacks' tries at goal. It was only<br />\nafter seven and a half minutes of hard play<br />\nthat Strobhar was able to make the first gaal,<br />\nand then it took at least fifteen minutes more<br />\nfor Knipp to break through Lehigh's close<br />\ndefense to shoot the second. This was the<br />\nlast score made in the half, and it looked<br />\nas though we would be able to shut the<br />\nvisitors out in the second half, but in this<br />\nrespect we were sadly disappointed.<br />\nWhen the second half began we found<br />\nthat what we had to do was not to shut Lehigh out, but that we had to work to keep<br />\nfrom being shut out ourselves. Lehigh began the half with a rush, and as the Hopkins<br />\ndefense was playing rather loosely, Harrower<br />\nsoon penetrated it for Lehigh's first goal.<br />\nAnd a few minutes later, De Schweinitz<br />\npassed the rubber in the net for the visitor's<br />\nsecond goal. This tied the score, and Hopkins realized that it was up to her to play<br />\na little steadier game.<br />\nAs a result of this realization, the ball was<br />\nkept in Lehigh's territory most of the time,<br />\nbut time and time again we were kept from<br />\nscoring by the brilliant stops made by the<br />\nLehigh goal tend. Finally, after 20 minutes<br />\nof such play, Strobhar was able to shoot the<br />\nthird goal and a few minutes later followed<br />\nit with a fourth. The game was now safe,<br />\nand the remainder of the half was spent in<br />\nkeeping Lehigh from scoring.<br />\nThe line-up:<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 2; MT.
