Now, more than ever before, A\u2014<br />\nmericans clearly have a mandate for the active and visible<br />\nexpression of their indignation.<br />\nThere no longer exists any excuse for Hopkins students to ignore this imperative. The Academic Council's<br />\nrecommendations have moved to eliminate scholastic<br />\nobstacles to timely political expression.<br />\nMany courses of action have been outlined to effect<br />\nchange in the nation's foreign policy: all of these have<br />\nfailed individually in the past. The time is right for<br />\naction, as the time has been right so frequently before. Many methods have failed, hut the method of<br />\nall-out attack on all fronts has never failed\u2014it has never<br />\nbeen tried. This diversified approach should be coupled<br />\nwith another strategy which has never been executed<br />\nbefore: a sustained, long-term drive, not for a weekend,<br />\nnot for a week, not when the weather is nice, but until<br />\nthe government makes its policies coincident with the<br />\ndesires of its citizens.<br />\nThis sort of action, when many claim the anti-war<br />\nmovement is dying, would show those currently in<br />\npower that change roust be implemented. Hopkins students have the opportunity co take the lead in this<br />\nmovement. Silence is acquiescence.<br />\n<br />\nAn open letter to all<br />\nUndergraduates, Graduates.<br />\nFaculty and Administration:<br />\nTonight. at 7:30 pm., in the.<br />\nGreat Hall of Levering there will<br />\nbe - a meeting for all people<br />\ninterested in participating in the<br />\nlobbying effort that will be going<br />\non in Washington next week. The<br />\nmeeting will be organizational in<br />\nnature concerning such topics as<br />\nlobbying.strategy. transportation<br />\nto Washington. times, places. etc.<br />\nAnnouncements of this sort<br />\nbring back memories of 1970 and<br />\nCambodia. Usually these<br />\nmemories are marred by a feeling<br />\nof fiustration, knowing that we<br />\ndid our best but ultimately<br />\nfailed. However, there are two<br />\ndifferences between 1970 and<br />\n1972 that should give us new<br />\nhope.<br />\nThe first difference is that<br />\ninstead. of being disgruntled<br />\nstudents, we are now disgruntled<br />\nvoters. After spending yesterday<br />\nin Washington. I realized what a<br />\nbig difference this makes.<br />\nThe second, and I think the<br />\nmost important difference, is<br />\nthat ill 1970 we felt that by<br />\nshowing our dissatisfaction with<br />\nthe war, the President would<br />\nsomehow see fit to de-escalate it.<br />\nWe now realize that Mr. Nixon<br />\nwill not take the necessary steps<br />\nin that direction. Given this fact,<br />\nI feel that the most, effective<br />\naction we can take is to deter the<br />\nPresident via Congress, and this is<br />\nmost effectively instituted<br />\nthrough lobbying.<br />\nOpposition to the war is<br />\nvaluable on any level. Yesterday<br />\nthe newly elected Student<br />\nCouncil issued a statement with<br />\nsix suggestions for expressing<br />\ndissatisfaction. All six are valid<br />\nand many options were not<br />\nmentioned that are equally vaild.<br />\nThis time we must realize that<br />\nexpressing dissatisfaction in 1970<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nPeace with McGovern<br />\nThe only way in which<br />\nAmerican military withdrawal<br />\nfrom Vietnam can be assured is<br />\nby the election of a President<br />\nwho has consistently opposed the<br />\nWar. Time and again we have<br />\nseen demonstrations against the<br />\nwar, Congressional resolutions<br />\ncalling for a withdrawl deadline,<br />\nand speeches from Richard<br />\nNixon promising an end to the<br />\nfighting. The war continues<br />\nbecause the Commander in Chief<br />\nof the United States, despite<br />\npublic opinion, is unwilling to<br />\npreside over what he perceives as<br />\nan American surrender.<br />\nIt is extremely uncertain that<br />\nwe can ever expect total<br />\nwithdraw! while Richard Nixon is<br />\nPresident. The President's<br />\nreaction to the failure of<br />\nVietnamization has been to<br />\nescalate the war to an extremely<br />\ndangerous level. If we are to<br />\ndepend on the stability of the<br />\nThieu regime as the determinig<br />\nfactor in our withdrawal rate, we<br />\nare likely to remain in Vietnam<br />\nfor many years to<br />\nThere is, however, one<br />\ncome.<br />\nthing of which we can be certain.<br />\nIf George McGovern were<br />\n<br />\nPresident of the United States<br />\ntoday, there would not be one<br />\nAmerican soldier left in Vietnam<br />\nas of the first of September 1st<br />\nof this year. As a man who has<br />\nopposed U.S. involvement in<br />\nIndochina since 1963, Senator<br />\nMcGovern would end all our<br />\naerial bombardment of Vietnam<br />\nimmediately upon his<br />\ninnauguration, and would<br />\nwithdraw all our forces within<br />\nfour months. He has proposed as<br />\nmuch several times in the Senate<br />\nwith the McGovern-Hatfield<br />\nDisengagement Act.<br />\nA McGovern victory would<br />\nthus mean the end of our<br />\ninvolvement in Indochina, once<br />\nand for all. By working through<br />\nthe electoral process, we can<br />\nreplace the man who has<br />\nescalated this war with one who<br />\nwill stop it. To support George<br />\nMcGovern is to support a<br />\nrealizeable chance for peace.<br />\nTher can be no question after<br />\nthe primaries in Wisconson,<br />\nMassachusetts, Ohio, and<br />\nNebraska, that Senator<br />\nMcGovern has an excellent<br />\nchance of winning the<br />\nDemocratic nomination and<br />\n<br />\nclfeating Richard Nixon in<br />\nNovember. His support has been<br />\nstrong in all segments of the<br />\npopulation, rom blue collar<br />\nworkers to students..Through the<br />\nwork of thousands of volunteer<br />\nworkers, McGovern has won<br />\nvictories in areas where he had<br />\nbeen given no chance by the<br />\npress or political \"pros.\" With a<br />\nsimilar effort in Maryland, the<br />\nSenator can make an excellent<br />\nshowing here and pick up<br />\nadditional delegates to the<br />\nconvention.<br />\nCampaign workers are needed<br />\ndaily, up to and including<br />\nelection day. Activities include<br />\ndoor to door canvassing,<br />\nleafletting, and phone canvassing.<br />\nIn addition, volunteers are<br />\nneeded to hand out sample<br />\nballots at the polls. Senator<br />\nMcGovern will speak at 6 pm.<br />\nSaturday at the Merriweather<br />\nPost Pavillion in Columbia, and a<br />\nlarge turnout would greatly help<br />\nthe campaign. To volunteer, stop<br />\nby McGovern headquarters at<br />\n817 N. Charles St. (phone<br />\n685-7718).<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nDavid Baron<br />\n<br />\nterms is not enough. I feel we<br />\nmust turn to the Congress which<br />\nhas the Constitutional right and<br />\nduty to deter the President if the<br />\nAmerican people deem it to be<br />\nnecessary. and I believe they do.<br />\nToo long has Mr. Nixon been<br />\nbasing his actions on a silent<br />\nmajority. If we are to expect<br />\nCongress to act, we must tell it<br />\nhow we feel. When Congressmen<br />\nfind out that you can vote, they<br />\nbecome extremely receptive.<br />\n<br />\nThey must listen, as their jobs<br />\ndepend on it.<br />\nAs you know, through a very<br />\nwierd series of events yesterday,<br />\nHopkins has been given a chance<br />\nto play a major role in starting a<br />\nconcerted National Lobby. I urge<br />\nall members of the community to<br />\nat<br />\ntonight's meeting and<br />\nmaybe we can stop Mr. Nixon<br />\nand this war.<br />\nAndrew Savitz<br />\nPresident Student Council<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nWide-based action<br />\nThe an n ouncemen t of<br />\nPresident Nixon - has caused<br />\npeople to once more think about<br />\nthe war in Vietnam and its effect<br />\nnot only on their own lives but<br />\nupon the well-being of all the<br />\npeoples of the world. In response<br />\nto a new escalation of the<br />\nconflict an effort is being made<br />\nto renew the anti-war movement<br />\nand make a strong protest. Yet<br />\nmany of us do not know how to<br />\ndo that.<br />\nSome people would like to<br />\nshow their moral outrage by<br />\nfire-bombing ROTC buildings,<br />\nengaging in sit-ins and other<br />\nvisible, but verbal,<br />\ndemonstrations of<br />\ncondemnation. Such actions no<br />\nlonger serve a viable function.<br />\nCertainly, they provide an outlet<br />\nfor justafiably enraged people,<br />\nbut they fail to strike the heart<br />\nof the matter.<br />\nOn Tuesday, May 9, people at<br />\nHopkins began to meet to discuss<br />\nthis problem and seek new<br />\nsolutions. These people are held<br />\ntogether by the common<br />\nrealization that it is necessary at<br />\nthis time to move off campus and<br />\norganize a strong resistance on<br />\nthe city, state, and national<br />\nlevels. Such a movement, if it is<br />\nto succeed, must develop a<br />\ncoherent policy for action. That<br />\npolicy must involve members of<br />\nall classes within our society,<br />\nwho realize that the war must<br />\nend immediately not only<br />\nbecause it is a moral outrage, but<br />\nalso because it is a repressive,<br />\nreactionary, imperialistic<br />\nexpression of the ruling class's<br />\nideology. That policy causes<br />\n<br />\ninflaction in this country and<br />\ndeath and destruction abroad.<br />\nOur problem is to determine<br />\nthe best way to defeat that<br />\npolicy and turn its advocates out<br />\nof office. Such a goal involves<br />\ntime, money, and manpower resources which the members of<br />\nthe Hopkins community possess.<br />\nAlready an attempt is being made<br />\nto draw interested groups and<br />\npeople together on a city-wide<br />\nle,vel to develop concrete<br />\nproposals for action which cover<br />\nthe full spectrum of political<br />\nactivity. People are needed to<br />\nparticipate in the planning,<br />\npeople who are willing to work<br />\ntoward contacting labor unions<br />\nand businessmen. If we work<br />\nhard and quickly, we may be able<br />\nto bring real economic pressure<br />\nto bear upon the government of<br />\nthis country, to show them that<br />\nwe know that the basis of the<br />\nwar is economic, that we know<br />\nwe will win not by filling the<br />\njails, but by making them feel the<br />\neconomic crunch to which they<br />\nhave subjected the hard-working<br />\ncitizens of this country.

The Academic Council's<br />\nrecommendations have moved to eliminate scholastic<br />\nobstacles to timely political expression.<br />\nMany courses of action have been outlined to effect<br />\nchange in the nation's foreign policy: all of these have<br />\nfailed individually in the past.

Usually these<br />\nmemories are marred by a feeling<br />\nof fiustration, knowing that we<br />\ndid our best but ultimately<br />\nfailed. However, there are two<br />\ndifferences between 1970 and<br />\n1972 that should give us new<br />\nhope.<br />\nThe first difference is that<br />\ninstead. of being disgruntled<br />\nstudents, we are now disgruntled<br />\nvoters. After spending yesterday<br />\nin Washington. I realized what a<br />\nbig difference this makes.<br />\nThe second, and I think the<br />\nmost important difference, is<br />\nthat ill 1970 we felt that by<br />\nshowing our dissatisfaction with<br />\nthe war, the President would<br />\nsomehow see fit to de-escalate it.<br />\nWe now realize that Mr. Nixon<br />\nwill not take the necessary steps<br />\nin that direction. Given this fact,<br />\nI feel that the most, effective<br />\naction we can take is to deter the<br />\nPresident via Congress, and this is<br />\nmost effectively instituted<br />\nthrough lobbying.<br />\nOpposition to the war is<br />\nvaluable on any level. Yesterday<br />\nthe newly elected Student<br />\nCouncil issued a statement with<br />\nsix suggestions for expressing<br />\ndissatisfaction. All six are valid<br />\nand many options were not<br />\nmentioned that are equally vaild.<br />\nThis time we must realize that<br />\nexpressing dissatisfaction in 1970<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nPeace with McGovern<br />\nThe only way in which<br />\nAmerican military withdrawal<br />\nfrom Vietnam can be assured is<br />\nby the election of a President<br />\nwho has consistently opposed the<br />\nWar. Time and again we have<br />\nseen demonstrations against the<br />\nwar, Congressional resolutions<br />\ncalling for a withdrawl deadline,<br />\nand speeches from Richard<br />\nNixon promising an end to the<br />\nfighting. The war continues<br />\nbecause the Commander in Chief<br />\nof the United States, despite<br />\npublic opinion, is unwilling to<br />\npreside over what he perceives as<br />\nan American surrender.<br />\nIt is extremely uncertain that<br />\nwe can ever expect total<br />\nwithdraw! while Richard Nixon is<br />\nPresident. The President's<br />\nreaction to the failure of<br />\nVietnamization has been to<br />\nescalate the war to an extremely<br />\ndangerous level. If we are to<br />\ndepend on the stability of the<br />\nThieu regime as the determinig<br />\nfactor in our withdrawal rate, we<br />\nare likely to remain in Vietnam<br />\nfor many years to<br />\nThere is, however, one<br />\ncome.<br />\nthing of which we can be certain.<br />\nIf George McGovern were<br /><br />\nPresident of the United States<br />\ntoday, there would not be one<br />\nAmerican soldier left in Vietnam<br />\nas of the first of September 1st<br />\nof this year. As a man who has<br />\nopposed U.S. involvement in<br />\nIndochina since 1963, Senator<br />\nMcGovern would end all our<br />\naerial bombardment of Vietnam<br />\nimmediately upon his<br />\ninnauguration, and would<br />\nwithdraw all our forces within<br />\nfour months. He has proposed as<br />\nmuch several times in the Senate<br />\nwith the McGovern-Hatfield<br />\nDisengagement Act.<br />\nA McGovern victory would<br />\nthus mean the end of our<br />\ninvolvement in Indochina, once<br />\nand for all. By working through<br />\nthe electoral process, we can<br />\nreplace the man who has<br />\nescalated this war with one who<br />\nwill stop it. To support George<br />\nMcGovern is to support a<br />\nrealizeable chance for peace.<br />\nTher can be no question after<br />\nthe primaries in Wisconson,<br />\nMassachusetts, Ohio, and<br />\nNebraska, that Senator<br />\nMcGovern has an excellent<br />\nchance of winning the<br />\nDemocratic nomination and<br /><br />\nclfeating Richard Nixon in<br />\nNovember. His support has been<br />\nstrong in all segments of the<br />\npopulation, rom blue collar<br />\nworkers to students..Through the<br />\nwork of thousands of volunteer<br />\nworkers, McGovern has won<br />\nvictories in areas where he had<br />\nbeen given no chance by the<br />\npress or political \"pros.\" With a<br />\nsimilar effort in Maryland, the<br />\nSenator can make an excellent<br />\nshowing here and pick up<br />\nadditional delegates to the<br />\nconvention.<br />\nCampaign workers are needed<br />\ndaily, up to and including<br />\nelection day. Activities include<br />\ndoor to door canvassing,<br />\nleafletting, and phone canvassing.<br />\nIn addition, volunteers are<br />\nneeded to hand out sample<br />\nballots at the polls. Senator<br />\nMcGovern will speak at 6 pm.<br />\nSaturday at the Merriweather<br />\nPost Pavillion in Columbia, and a<br />\nlarge turnout would greatly help<br />\nthe campaign. To volunteer, stop<br />\nby McGovern headquarters at<br />\n817 N. Charles St. (phone<br />\n685-7718).<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nDavid Baron<br /><br />\nterms is not enough. I feel we<br />\nmust turn to the Congress which<br />\nhas the Constitutional right and<br />\nduty to deter the President if the<br />\nAmerican people deem it to be<br />\nnecessary. and I believe they do.<br />\nToo long has Mr. Nixon been<br />\nbasing his actions on a silent<br />\nmajority. If we are to expect<br />\nCongress to act, we must tell it<br />\nhow we feel. When Congressmen<br />\nfind out that you can vote, they<br />\nbecome extremely receptive.<br /><br />\nThey must listen, as their jobs<br />\ndepend on it.<br />\nAs you know, through a very<br />\nwierd series of events yesterday,<br />\nHopkins has been given a chance<br />\nto play a major role in starting a<br />\nconcerted National Lobby. I urge<br />\nall members of the community to<br />\nat<br />\ntonight's meeting and<br />\nmaybe we can stop Mr. Nixon<br />\nand this war.<br />\nAndrew Savitz<br />\nPresident Student Council<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nWide-based action<br />\nThe an n ouncemen t of<br />\nPresident Nixon - has caused<br />\npeople to once more think about<br />\nthe war in Vietnam and its effect<br />\nnot only on their own lives but<br />\nupon the well-being of all the<br />\npeoples of the world. In response<br />\nto a new escalation of the<br />\nconflict an effort is being made<br />\nto renew the anti-war movement<br />\nand make a strong protest. Yet<br />\nmany of us do not know how to<br />\ndo that.<br />\nSome people would like to<br />\nshow their moral outrage by<br />\nfire-bombing ROTC buildings,<br />\nengaging in sit-ins and other<br />\nvisible, but verbal,<br />\ndemonstrations of<br />\ncondemnation. Such actions no<br />\nlonger serve a viable function.<br />\nCertainly, they provide an outlet<br />\nfor justafiably enraged people,<br />\nbut they fail to strike the heart<br />\nof the matter.<br />\nOn Tuesday, May 9, people at<br />\nHopkins began to meet to discuss<br />\nthis problem and seek new<br />\nsolutions. These people are held<br />\ntogether by the common<br />\nrealization that it is necessary at<br />\nthis time to move off campus and<br />\norganize a strong resistance on<br />\nthe city, state, and national<br />\nlevels. Such a movement, if it is<br />\nto succeed, must develop a<br />\ncoherent policy for action. That<br />\npolicy must involve members of<br />\nall classes within our society,<br />\nwho realize that the war must<br />\nend immediately not only<br />\nbecause it is a moral outrage, but<br />\nalso because it is a repressive,<br />\nreactionary, imperialistic<br />\nexpression of the ruling class's<br />\nideology. That policy causes<br /><br />\ninflaction in this country and<br />\ndeath and destruction abroad.<br />\nOur problem is to determine<br />\nthe best way to defeat that<br />\npolicy and turn its advocates out<br />\nof office. Such a goal involves<br />\ntime, money, and manpower resources which the members of<br />\nthe Hopkins community possess.<br />\nAlready an attempt is being made<br />\nto draw interested groups and<br />\npeople together on a city-wide<br />\nle,vel to develop concrete<br />\nproposals for action which cover<br />\nthe full spectrum of political<br />\nactivity. People are needed to<br />\nparticipate in the planning,<br />\npeople who are willing to work<br />\ntoward contacting labor unions<br />\nand businessmen. If we work<br />\nhard and quickly, we may be able<br />\nto bring real economic pressure<br />\nto bear upon the government of<br />\nthis country, to show them that<br />\nwe know that the basis of the<br />\nwar is economic, that we know<br />\nwe will win not by filling the<br />\njails, but by making them feel the<br />\neconomic crunch to which they<br />\nhave subjected the hard-working<br />\ncitizens of this country.
