Let's thicken our hides and harden our heads.<br />\n\"I'm damned if we can't stay out.\"<br />\nThe great debate is on<br />\nand the floor of the Senate is its ampitheatre. With<br />\nall the arts of rhetoric and<br />\npolitical pressure the Gentlemen from the forty-eight<br />\nstates are struggling to decide the fate of the Neutrality Law. While the battle<br />\nof words proceeds apace, however, everyone realizes<br />\nthat the fundamental issue is deeper: shall America<br />\nintervene in Europe's conflict, or shall America abstain.<br />\nAny sensible analysis of the embargo question must<br />\nbe predicated upon a whole-hearted attempt to keep this<br />\ncountry out of war. War is destructive, anti-social,<br />\nanti-humanitarian. Yet it will inevitably come to<br />\nAmerica if we are concerned first of all with destroying<br />\nHitlerism or saving the British empire or liberating<br />\nthe Poles. In the present international crisis ,our<br />\nsingle thought must be peace for the United States.<br />\nAll courses of action must be predicated upon this<br />\nsingle dogma.<br />\nPacifism is threatened on two fronts\u2014the economic<br />\nand the psychological. If our economy becomes dependent upon the reassertion of Franco-British supremacy in Europe or upon the perpetuation of a war<br />\nprosperity, we will go to war. We will just as certainly entire the conflict if we are led to believe that<br />\nthe survival of our ideals depend upon an Allied<br />\nvictory.<br />\n<br />\nAction<br />\nand<br />\nFaction<br />\n<br />\nThe legislative alternatives now before the Senate<br />\nmust be considered in the light of the influence each<br />\nmight have in checking the above tendencies: The<br />\npresem embargo law has the advantage of restraining<br />\na munitions boom.<br />\nYet the finished products of war constitute only a<br />\ntiny part of the things the embattled nations need<br />\nfrom us. Our trade in steel and cotton and foodstuffs<br />\nmay just as well involve us. Thus the Neutrality<br />\nAct is only partially effective. Realizing this the<br />\nrepealists put forward the cash and carry plan as a<br />\npanacea. The cash part of the bill has little meaning.<br />\nWe already have the Johnson Act to prevent us from<br />\nextending credit. The carry feature of the plan,<br />\nproviding that all trade with belligerents shall be<br />\ncarried on in their ships, assures that the destruction<br />\nof American vessels will not provide an excuse for<br />\nintervention.<br />\nTo this extent cash and carry operates as a positive force for neutrality. Yet the crux of the issue is<br />\nnot the cash and carry plan. What the Senate is<br />\nis most concerned with is the repeal of the arms embargo. The advocates of this plan propose it as<br />\na substitute measure to take the place of the embargo,<br />\nnot to reinforce it. No administration leader has yet<br />\noffered cash and carry restrictions on their own merit.<br />\nIt is evident from this that the repealists are more<br />\ninterested in reopening the dangerous munitions trade<br />\nthan they are in protecting American ships..<br />\nAgain and again the Administration leaders justify<br />\ntheir plan as an aid to England and France against<br />\nfascist aggression. To lovers of peace this is no<br />\njustification, and in a saner time it would be seen<br />\nthat these states are no more the protagonists of humanitarian dreams than are the totalitarian governments.<br />\nOn the other hand, support for the retention of<br />\nthe 1937 Neutrality Act comes from those whose chief<br />\ndesire is to keep America out of foreign wars.<br />\nBy the repeal of the Neutrality Act America takes<br />\nthe first step on the road to war.

S. college students\u2014some 1,400,000-strong\u2014returned to classrooms<br />\nand campuses last month amid a loud chorus of warnings and implorings.<br />\nThey were warned by the press to maintain an open and thinking attitude<br />\non the present European war. They were implored to use their every<br />\ninfluence to keep the U S out of war and to bend every energy to a<br />\nsincere study of the world's problems and how they can be met.<br />\nFrom the surveys that have appeared to date, it appears that the average<br />\ncollegian has heeded these warnings and these commands. He maintains<br />\nthat he does not want to go to war, that he wants the U. S. to remain neutral.<br />\nBut he seems to have no objection to the U S selling goods of all kinds to<br />\nthe warring nations, so long as it is on a cash-and-carry basis. First real<br />\nobjection to the President's proposed neutrality act changes was made at<br />\nSt John's University, where 650 students signed a letter to the Chief Executive protesting \"a new partisan neutrality act without first consulting the<br />\npeople through the medium of a referendum.\" This movement has not yet<br />\ngained much headway.<br />\n<br />\nOn the 0<br />\nEditor's desk<br />\nEditor of the News-Letter:<br />\n<br />\nThe Prior<br />\nAssumption--<br />\n<br />\ntime and discussed the new program<br />\n<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nThe Barnstormers, dramatic club at<br />\nthe University, met today for the first<br />\nfor the year.

Its government was \u2018a cross between pre-Revolution France and our own ante-bellum South. With a set of internal problems that<br />\nwould have staggered a coalition of Lincoln, Bismarck and Roosevelt, the shrewd gang of aristocrats<br />\nand ambitious nationalists that led it frittered away<br />\ntwo decades of ascendancy. They have been robbed<br />\nof about 35,000,000 suckers who supported them in<br />\na manner to which they wanted to become accustomed.<br />\nUpwards of 12,000,000 of these can neither read<br />\nnor write. Hordes of them roamed around gallant<br />\nlittle Poland without job or home. Lumped with their<br />\nmore fortunate brethren, some of whose families had<br />\nas much as $180 a year to live on, they had the lowest standard of living in Europe. They watched the<br />\ncharming, but inconsiderate gangsters who ruled them<br />\nspend half their taxes on an army that has proved<br />\nmore dashing than effective. With no jobs and so<br />\nlittle to eat that meals took up no time at all, they<br />\nhad plenty of time to blame it all on their fellow<br />\nPoles, the Jews. They engaged in as ruthless a persecution of the Jews as took place anywhere in<br />\nEurope.<br />\nBut not even the fact that gallant little \u2014Oland<br />\nhad done, or attempted to do, to Russia, Lithuania,<br />\nand Czechoslovakia precisely what Germany has done<br />\nto her excuses Germany.

With their leaders<br />\nin exile or cleaned up in the coup d'etat of 1930, the<br />\npeasants had little chance for social reform. Russia<br />\nis far from simon pure in her communism; some say<br />\nshe approaches Fascism.

But perhaps<br />\neven now that war has come, with all its terror, fear,<br />\nlies, false hope, narrow ambition, greed, and cupidity,<br />\nit will prove the salvation of a land that looked toward<br />\nthe Black Sea instead of into the faces of its peasants.<br />\n<br />\nContemporary Collegiana<br />\n<br />\nIt is to men who are not afraid to<br />\ntake inventory that I direct my<br />\nAnte Mortems. . . .<br />\n<br />\nOne assumption, and the only one<br />\nI can make with reasonable expecta-<br />\n<br />\nof world<br />\n<br />\nculture that nations at war now, or<br />\non the verge of war, have left in her<br />\nhands.<br />\n<br />\nthe whole-hearted cooperation of the<br />\nstudent body.

Our first attempts to realize our columnur ambitions in print were repulsed when Feature editor Victor M.

There are many<br />\nquestions of national policy which I<br />\ndoubt I can ever answer to anyone's<br />\nfull satisfaction but my own; nevertheless, I can give you the principle, the law by which they may be<br />\njudged. The choice between peace and<br />\nwar is made not by the weak but<br />\nby the strong. To this there is the<br />\ncorollary that no policy, however wise<br />\nand upright, can succeed unless it<br />\nis backed by force. This force may<br />\nnot be exerted, if it is ready, and if<br />\nthe world knows it is ready; nevertheless, potential strength is not<br />\nenough. J P Morgan can hire a regiment of bodyguards, but all the potential power in his bankbook would<br />\nnot help him a whit if he were waylaid by a thug in an alley. This<br />\nrich nation, with its tremendous latent power lying undeveloped, is actually in the same position as that<br />\nfat old man\u2014rich, but almost defenseless.

With<br />\nall the arts of rhetoric and<br />\npolitical pressure the Gentlemen from the forty-eight<br />\nstates are struggling to decide the fate of the Neutrality Law. While the battle<br />\nof words proceeds apace, however, everyone realizes<br />\nthat the fundamental issue is deeper: shall America<br />\nintervene in Europe's conflict, or shall America abstain.<br />\nAny sensible analysis of the embargo question must<br />\nbe predicated upon a whole-hearted attempt to keep this<br />\ncountry out of war. War is destructive, anti-social,<br />\nanti-humanitarian. Yet it will inevitably come to<br />\nAmerica if we are concerned first of all with destroying<br />\nHitlerism or saving the British empire or liberating<br />\nthe Poles.

If our economy becomes dependent upon the reassertion of Franco-British supremacy in Europe or upon the perpetuation of a war<br />\nprosperity, we will go to war. We will just as certainly entire the conflict if we are led to believe that<br />\nthe survival of our ideals depend upon an Allied<br />\nvictory.<br /><br />\nAction<br />\nand<br />\nFaction<br /><br />\nThe legislative alternatives now before the Senate<br />\nmust be considered in the light of the influence each<br />\nmight have in checking the above tendencies: The<br />\npresem embargo law has the advantage of restraining<br />\na munitions boom.<br />\nYet the finished products of war constitute only a<br />\ntiny part of the things the embattled nations need<br />\nfrom us. Our trade in steel and cotton and foodstuffs<br />\nmay just as well involve us. Thus the Neutrality<br />\nAct is only partially effective. Realizing this the<br />\nrepealists put forward the cash and carry plan as a<br />\npanacea. The cash part of the bill has little meaning.<br />\nWe already have the Johnson Act to prevent us from<br />\nextending credit. The carry feature of the plan,<br />\nproviding that all trade with belligerents shall be<br />\ncarried on in their ships, assures that the destruction<br />\nof American vessels will not provide an excuse for<br />\nintervention.<br />\nTo this extent cash and carry operates as a positive force for neutrality. Yet the crux of the issue is<br />\nnot the cash and carry plan. What the Senate is<br />\nis most concerned with is the repeal of the arms embargo. The advocates of this plan propose it as<br />\na substitute measure to take the place of the embargo,<br />\nnot to reinforce it. No administration leader has yet<br />\noffered cash and carry restrictions on their own merit.<br />\nIt is evident from this that the repealists are more<br />\ninterested in reopening the dangerous munitions trade<br />\nthan they are in protecting American ships..<br />\nAgain and again the Administration leaders justify<br />\ntheir plan as an aid to England and France against<br />\nfascist aggression. To lovers of peace this is no<br />\njustification, and in a saner time it would be seen<br />\nthat these states are no more the protagonists of humanitarian dreams than are the totalitarian governments.<br />\nOn the other hand, support for the retention of<br />\nthe 1937 Neutrality Act comes from those whose chief<br />\ndesire is to keep America out of foreign wars.<br />\nBy the repeal of the Neutrality Act America takes<br />\nthe first step on the road to war. By scrapping it<br />\nCongress removes the last restriction upon a closer<br />\nand closer reapprochement with England and France<br />\nand at the same time strips from us the greatest<br />\nprotection of neutrality\u2014the spirit of isolationism.<br />\nIf the Senate really wants, above all else, America<br />\nto stay out of war, let it pass the cash and carry plan.<br />\nBut let it preserve the embargo.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,<br /><br />\n. .Ante<br />\nMortems<br />\nBy Victor M Victoroff<br />\nIt is desirable to believe that opinions are based on unqualified policy<br />\nin turn formulated with respect to<br />\ninformation at hand.

But intentionally or not,<br />\nwe blind ourselves to certain facts or<br />\nelse do not expose ourselves to what<br />\nmay, having been granted, cause us<br />\nto recant a previous judgment.<br />\nThe posterior view lacks dignity,<br />\nand the indelicacy of retreat, despite<br />\nexpediency, is usually<br /><br />\navoided<br /><br />\nby<br /><br />\nmaking Le Grand Gesture.

S. college students\u2014some 1,400,000-strong\u2014returned to classrooms<br />\nand campuses last month amid a loud chorus of warnings and implorings.<br />\nThey were warned by the press to maintain an open and thinking attitude<br />\non the present European war. They were implored to use their every<br />\ninfluence to keep the U S out of war and to bend every energy to a<br />\nsincere study of the world's problems and how they can be met.<br />\nFrom the surveys that have appeared to date, it appears that the average<br />\ncollegian has heeded these warnings and these commands. He maintains<br />\nthat he does not want to go to war, that he wants the U. S. to remain neutral.<br />\nBut he seems to have no objection to the U S selling goods of all kinds to<br />\nthe warring nations, so long as it is on a cash-and-carry basis. First real<br />\nobjection to the President's proposed neutrality act changes was made at<br />\nSt John's University, where 650 students signed a letter to the Chief Executive protesting \"a new partisan neutrality act without first consulting the<br />\npeople through the medium of a referendum.\" This movement has not yet<br />\ngained much headway.<br /><br />\nOn the 0<br />\nEditor's desk<br />\nEditor of the News-Letter:<br /><br />\nThe Prior<br />\nAssumption--<br /><br />\ntime and discussed the new program<br /><br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nThe Barnstormers, dramatic club at<br />\nthe University, met today for the first<br />\nfor the year.

Its government was \u2018a cross between pre-Revolution France and our own ante-bellum South. With a set of internal problems that<br />\nwould have staggered a coalition of Lincoln, Bismarck and Roosevelt, the shrewd gang of aristocrats<br />\nand ambitious nationalists that led it frittered away<br />\ntwo decades of ascendancy. They have been robbed<br />\nof about 35,000,000 suckers who supported them in<br />\na manner to which they wanted to become accustomed.<br />\nUpwards of 12,000,000 of these can neither read<br />\nnor write. Hordes of them roamed around gallant<br />\nlittle Poland without job or home. Lumped with their<br />\nmore fortunate brethren, some of whose families had<br />\nas much as $180 a year to live on, they had the lowest standard of living in Europe. They watched the<br />\ncharming, but inconsiderate gangsters who ruled them<br />\nspend half their taxes on an army that has proved<br />\nmore dashing than effective. With no jobs and so<br />\nlittle to eat that meals took up no time at all, they<br />\nhad plenty of time to blame it all on their fellow<br />\nPoles, the Jews. They engaged in as ruthless a persecution of the Jews as took place anywhere in<br />\nEurope.<br />\nBut not even the fact that gallant little \u2014Oland<br />\nhad done, or attempted to do, to Russia, Lithuania,<br />\nand Czechoslovakia precisely what Germany has done<br />\nto her excuses Germany.

With their leaders<br />\nin exile or cleaned up in the coup d'etat of 1930, the<br />\npeasants had little chance for social reform. Russia<br />\nis far from simon pure in her communism; some say<br />\nshe approaches Fascism. But liquidation of estates<br />\nand the establishment of soviets in Polish factories<br />\nhardly smacks of Fascism. It's the first sensible attack on Poland's internal problems that anyone has<br />\nattempted, whether we like communism or not.<br />\nThe path to partition led straight from Munich.<br />\nOn the strength of past performances and in spite of<br />\nher assurances to Poland, England could hardly have<br />\nbeen expected to stand by the Poles; that she did<br />\ncame as a distinct surprise to Russia, who had not<br />\nenvisioned a general war, according to the usually<br />\nreliable foreign correspondent Geyde. But perhaps<br />\neven now that war has come, with all its terror, fear,<br />\nlies, false hope, narrow ambition, greed, and cupidity,<br />\nit will prove the salvation of a land that looked toward<br />\nthe Black Sea instead of into the faces of its peasants.<br /><br />\nContemporary Collegiana<br /><br />\nIt is to men who are not afraid to<br />\ntake inventory that I direct my<br />\nAnte Mortems. . . .<br /><br />\nOne assumption, and the only one<br />\nI can make with reasonable expecta-<br /><br />\nof world<br /><br />\nculture that nations at war now, or<br />\non the verge of war, have left in her<br />\nhands.<br /><br />\nthe whole-hearted cooperation of the<br />\nstudent body.

Our first attempts to realize our columnur ambitions in print were repulsed when Feature editor Victor M. Victoroff stated that he was converting his page into a \"War Sheet\" where<br />\nany campus discussion would be \"irregular and erroneous.\" Editor Victoroff has one vote more than we on the Board of control so we were prompt<br />\nin accepting his refusal and deserting to other possibilities.<br />\nOur next crusade met with fellow Assistant Managing editor, \"Toy\"<br />\nSwerdloff, who stated a new physical theory on the survival of the first<br />\nand hastened to \"see us off.\" \"Toy\" you know scribbles off a Winchellized<br />\nradio column every other week which he has intellectually labeled \"Sound<br />\non Cue.\" His hobby from the first has been to boost the \"boys,\" imitate<br />\nJohn Kieran, and generally expound on the capabilities of Tommy Dorsey,<br />\nGlenn Miller, and Orson Welles.<br />\nOur campaign to write was won, however, when this newspaper<br />\nfound itself with a back page sans advertising and likewise scarce of copy.<br />\nHaving started the precedent, we doubt whether managing editors will<br />\nhasten to toss our \"inches\" away each week without at least a little consideration.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nmaterial.<br />\nTHIS IS NOT simply a personal<br />\n'matter .The nation, if it wishes to<br />\nmaintain itself, faces the same necessity of readiness for the ultimate<br />\nresort to arms. There are many<br />\nquestions of national policy which I<br />\ndoubt I can ever answer to anyone's<br />\nfull satisfaction but my own; nevertheless, I can give you the principle, the law by which they may be<br />\njudged. The choice between peace and<br />\nwar is made not by the weak but<br />\nby the strong. To this there is the<br />\ncorollary that no policy, however wise<br />\nand upright, can succeed unless it<br />\nis backed by force. This force may<br />\nnot be exerted, if it is ready, and if<br />\nthe world knows it is ready; nevertheless, potential strength is not<br />\nenough. J P Morgan can hire a regiment of bodyguards, but all the potential power in his bankbook would<br />\nnot help him a whit if he were waylaid by a thug in an alley. This<br />\nrich nation, with its tremendous latent power lying undeveloped, is actually in the same position as that<br />\nfat old man\u2014rich, but almost defenseless.

Only in land<br />\narmies can there be lasting strength,<br />\nactual and permanent military power.<br />\nThe nation needs this power; for<br />\nneutrality or intervention, for any<br />\neventuality, the nation must be<br />\nstrong.
