WOOD GIVES LECTURE<br />\nON VIOLET RAY<br />\nLarge Body of Students Present.<br />\nMany Interesting Phenomena<br />\nExplained.<br />\n<br />\nSo attractive was the mere announcement of a lecture by Dr.<br />\nRobert W. Wood, one of Hopkins'<br />\nmost famous scientists, on the subject with which his name is everywhere linked, that one of the largest crowds of the year besieged<br />\nthe doors of the lecture-room in<br />\nthe Mechanical Engineering Building, necessitating a division of the<br />\naudience into two relays. Dr.<br />\nWood very kindly consented to<br />\nthis plan, not objecting to the inconvenience of giving a continuous<br />\nperformance a la movies.<br />\nDr. Wood plunged immediately<br />\ninto the explanation of how he had<br />\nutilized the hitherto unrelated<br />\nphenomena connected with the<br />\nviol-ray emanations f o r producing a highly valuable method<br />\nof invisible night signalling on a<br />\npractical engineering scale. In<br />\nclear, simple language he sketched<br />\nthe theory and development of<br />\nthe ultra-violet ray lamp and receiver used by our navy during the<br />\nwar.<br />\nBefore giving his audience a<br />\nchance to see for themselves the<br />\nweird effects of his invention, the<br />\nlecturer explained what would<br />\nhappen. The _violet rays would<br />\ncause teeth and eyes to fluoresce,<br />\nand in the case of those close<br />\nenough to the lamp the skin and<br />\nnails would also shine.<br />\nThen the room lights were<br />\nturned down, and out of the darkness somewhere down in front<br />\nthere danced and faded a beautiful blue light, weak and retiring<br />\nas a will o' the wisp at first, but<br />\ngradually increasing in steadiness<br />\nto the time when a soft blue haze<br />\nbegan to settle before the eyes of<br />\nthe mystified observers. The nian<br />\nin the front row who turned away<br />\nfrom the lamp when the haze appeared only to see the teeth of his<br />\nfriend leaping out at him like the<br />\nadvertisement of a painless dentist may be pardoned if he dropped<br />\nhis books. Indeed, if Dr. Wood<br />\nhad not warned the assembly<br />\nahead of time that the blue haze<br />\nwas merely an effect of the fluorescing of the eyes under the violet<br />\nrays, many a man would have left<br />\nthe hall.<br />\nAfter he had finished exhibiting<br />\nmany of the peculiarities of his<br />\npet, Dr. Wood allowed the men to<br />\ncome down a few at a time to get.<br />\na close view of the phenomena. It<br />\nwas, indeed, a rare opportunity.<br />\nand no man who witnessed the<br />\ndemonstration is liable to forget<br />\nit for a long time.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 8, 1921<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nWith acknowledgments to K, C.

R. K.

WOOD GIVES LECTURE<br />\nON VIOLET RAY<br />\nLarge Body of Students Present.<br />\nMany Interesting Phenomena<br />\nExplained.<br /><br />\nSo attractive was the mere announcement of a lecture by Dr.<br />\nRobert W. Wood, one of Hopkins'<br />\nmost famous scientists, on the subject with which his name is everywhere linked, that one of the largest crowds of the year besieged<br />\nthe doors of the lecture-room in<br />\nthe Mechanical Engineering Building, necessitating a division of the<br />\naudience into two relays. Dr.<br />\nWood very kindly consented to<br />\nthis plan, not objecting to the inconvenience of giving a continuous<br />\nperformance a la movies.<br />\nDr. Wood plunged immediately<br />\ninto the explanation of how he had<br />\nutilized the hitherto unrelated<br />\nphenomena connected with the<br />\nviol-ray emanations f o r producing a highly valuable method<br />\nof invisible night signalling on a<br />\npractical engineering scale. In<br />\nclear, simple language he sketched<br />\nthe theory and development of<br />\nthe ultra-violet ray lamp and receiver used by our navy during the<br />\nwar.<br />\nBefore giving his audience a<br />\nchance to see for themselves the<br />\nweird effects of his invention, the<br />\nlecturer explained what would<br />\nhappen. The _violet rays would<br />\ncause teeth and eyes to fluoresce,<br />\nand in the case of those close<br />\nenough to the lamp the skin and<br />\nnails would also shine.<br />\nThen the room lights were<br />\nturned down, and out of the darkness somewhere down in front<br />\nthere danced and faded a beautiful blue light, weak and retiring<br />\nas a will o' the wisp at first, but<br />\ngradually increasing in steadiness<br />\nto the time when a soft blue haze<br />\nbegan to settle before the eyes of<br />\nthe mystified observers. The nian<br />\nin the front row who turned away<br />\nfrom the lamp when the haze appeared only to see the teeth of his<br />\nfriend leaping out at him like the<br />\nadvertisement of a painless dentist may be pardoned if he dropped<br />\nhis books. Indeed, if Dr. Wood<br />\nhad not warned the assembly<br />\nahead of time that the blue haze<br />\nwas merely an effect of the fluorescing of the eyes under the violet<br />\nrays, many a man would have left<br />\nthe hall.<br />\nAfter he had finished exhibiting<br />\nmany of the peculiarities of his<br />\npet, Dr. Wood allowed the men to<br />\ncome down a few at a time to get.<br />\na close view of the phenomena. It<br />\nwas, indeed, a rare opportunity.<br />\nand no man who witnessed the<br />\ndemonstration is liable to forget<br />\nit for a long time.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 8, 1921<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nWith acknowledgments to K, C.
