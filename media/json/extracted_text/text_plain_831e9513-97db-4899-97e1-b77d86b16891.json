H. DOWNS<br />\n<br />\nA. SCHUMACHER & CO.<br />\nWORTHY OF THOUGHT<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br />\nDear Sir: The Y. M. C. A.<br />\npiano is deteriorating so rapidly<br />\nunder the constant moving to<br />\nwhich it. has been subjected recently that it will be necessary<br />\nentirely to stop allowing it to be<br />\nmoved. This conclusion was<br />\nreached by the Y. M. C. A. under<br />\nthe urgent advice of the Superintendent of Buildings, who has had<br />\ncharge of moving the instrument.<br />\nSince it is not to be moved,<br />\nthere is the question of where it<br />\nwill be placed. For the present, it<br />\nwill be in the auditorium of the<br />\nCivil Engineering Building and<br />\nthose who desire to use it for<br />\nsome function may obtain the key<br />\nat the Y. M. C. A. office.<br />\nWe roalize that this will probably work considerable hardship<br />\non those who have been accustomed to use the piano at the<br />\nBarn, but it is simply a matter of<br />\nkeeping the piano in one place or<br />\nvery soon having no piano in<br />\nany place. It has recently made<br />\nas many as six trips in one week,<br />\ntraveling in all kinds of weather,<br />\nand though it has lasted unusually well, it has received very nearly all the moving it can stand. For<br />\nthis reason it has been deemed<br />\nnecessary to take the step that<br />\nwe have taken in refusing to allow it to be moved in the future.<br />\nOf course, the best solution of<br />\nthe problem would be to acquire<br />\nin some way another piano and<br />\nplace one in the Barn, and the<br />\nother in the C. E. Hall. Unfortunately, the Y. M. C. A. is not at<br />\npresent financially able to do this<br />\nalone, but we will be very glad to<br />\nreceive any suggestions as to how<br />\na piano might be acquired.<br />\n(Signed) Charles S.

H. DOWNS<br /><br />\nA. SCHUMACHER &amp; CO.<br />\nWORTHY OF THOUGHT<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br />\nDear Sir: The Y. M. C. A.<br />\npiano is deteriorating so rapidly<br />\nunder the constant moving to<br />\nwhich it. has been subjected recently that it will be necessary<br />\nentirely to stop allowing it to be<br />\nmoved. This conclusion was<br />\nreached by the Y. M. C. A. under<br />\nthe urgent advice of the Superintendent of Buildings, who has had<br />\ncharge of moving the instrument.<br />\nSince it is not to be moved,<br />\nthere is the question of where it<br />\nwill be placed. For the present, it<br />\nwill be in the auditorium of the<br />\nCivil Engineering Building and<br />\nthose who desire to use it for<br />\nsome function may obtain the key<br />\nat the Y. M. C. A. office.<br />\nWe roalize that this will probably work considerable hardship<br />\non those who have been accustomed to use the piano at the<br />\nBarn, but it is simply a matter of<br />\nkeeping the piano in one place or<br />\nvery soon having no piano in<br />\nany place. It has recently made<br />\nas many as six trips in one week,<br />\ntraveling in all kinds of weather,<br />\nand though it has lasted unusually well, it has received very nearly all the moving it can stand. For<br />\nthis reason it has been deemed<br />\nnecessary to take the step that<br />\nwe have taken in refusing to allow it to be moved in the future.<br />\nOf course, the best solution of<br />\nthe problem would be to acquire<br />\nin some way another piano and<br />\nplace one in the Barn, and the<br />\nother in the C. E. Hall. Unfortunately, the Y. M. C. A. is not at<br />\npresent financially able to do this<br />\nalone, but we will be very glad to<br />\nreceive any suggestions as to how<br />\na piano might be acquired.<br />\n(Signed) Charles S.
