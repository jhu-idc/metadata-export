More<br />\nmen than the number supervised by many civilian executives years older than yourself. To meet your command responsibilities, you employ a great many of the<br />\nLEADERSHIPprinciples acquired in advanced R.O.T.C.<br />\ntraining. And your executive potential develops while<br />\n<br />\nyou gather LEADERSHIP experience. The executive<br />\nability you gain as an Army officer will be an important<br />\nadvantage in any civilian career.

These men have already proven their<br />\ncapacity to handle executive responsibility.<br />\n<br />\n2...TRADITIONAL REWARDS<br />\nIn every organization, greater responsibilities mean<br />\ngreater rewards. The traditional prestige of an Army<br />\nofficer is matched by material advantages. A second<br />\nlieutenant earns a minimum of $355.88 per month\u2014<br />\nplus substantial fringe benefits. Think you might want<br />\nto marry soon after graduation? An officer's salary can<br />\n<br />\nmake things a great deal easier for a married couple<br />\njust starting out.

To meet your command responsibilities, you employ a great many of the<br />\nLEADERSHIPprinciples acquired in advanced R.O.T.C.<br />\ntraining. And your executive potential develops while<br /><br />\nyou gather LEADERSHIP experience. The executive<br />\nability you gain as an Army officer will be an important<br />\nadvantage in any civilian career.
