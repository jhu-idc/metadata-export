Last year's firing of Marge<br />\nMareck, a veteran secretary who complained to the National Labor Relations<br />\nBoard about her salary, revealed the depth<br />\nof employee discontent at JHU: an employees association was formed, demonstrations were held, and a survey of employees<br />\nindicated strong dissatisfaction with pay,<br />\nhours, and employer treatment.<br />\nThe University's subsequent actions<br />\nmade clear its high-handed and arbitrary<br />\nattitude toward its employees. The issue<br />\nwas not primarily whether Mrs. Mareck was<br />\njustified in seeking a raise, or whether she<br />\nwas no longer working effectively, as her<br />\nsuperior, Dr. Galambos, charged in firing<br />\nher. What is important is that the University repeatedly rejected Mrs. Mareck's<br />\nplease for an objective grievance hearing.<br />\nHer case was reviewed privately by various<br />\nadministration members, and her final<br />\ndismissal was approved singlehandedly by<br />\nDean Suskind. In addition, the University<br />\nrefused to recognize the newly-formed<br />\nJohns Hopkins Employees Association, and<br />\nmade no response to that group's proposal<br />\n<br />\nfor an objective grievance procedure. The<br />\nexisting procedure states only that \"any<br />\nstaff member has the right...to present any<br />\npersonal concern or dissatisfaction regarding his or her employment, and have it<br />\nconsidered on its merits,\" but sets no<br />\nspecific guidelines after that. The supervisor of an employee with a grievance can<br />\nmeet with administration officials, without<br />\nthe employee in attendance. While a<br />\nUniversity \"personnel committee\" is currently looking into revising the existing<br />\ngrievance procedure, the committee has<br />\nrefused to include any employees as<br />\nmembers. The JHEA's proposal laid out<br />\nspecific stages of bilateral discussion.<br />\nLast year the administration ignored<br />\nthe Student Council's resolution of support<br />\nfor the JHEA proposal. This year the<br />\nadministration has begun diplomatic relations in a more emphatic style, rejecting<br />\nthe proposed grievance procedure outright.<br />\nAdministrators have refused to meet with<br />\nany employee claiming to be a JHEA<br />\nrepresentative, and one employee was told<br />\nprivately that her group's best bet is to<br />\nbargain through the Janitors' Collective<br />\nBargaining Unit at Hopkins.<br />\nAnother<br />\nemployee described an encounter with the<br />\nadministration as \"like trying to talk to<br />\nExxon.\"<br />\nBig business, it appears, is still trying<br />\nto roll back the clock, right here at Exxon<br />\nUniversity.

At first<br />\nglance, watching the socially<br />\nparanoid freshmen looks like an<br />\namusing topic, one that we<br />\ngrown-up sophomores could<br />\nlook upon condescendingly, secure in our knowledge of the<br />\ntrials and tribulations of the<br />\nacademic world. But the truth<br />\nof it is that this fall is even more<br />\ntraumatic than the last. Perhaps<br />\npart of it is because we know<br />\nwhat we're getting into, academically speaking. Sure, we know<br />\nall 'the latest dirt about which<br />\nclasses you can cut and which<br />\nyou can't, and who grades on a<br />\ncurve, and so on, but we also<br />\nknow how much is riding on the<br />\nnext few years. I'm not saying<br />\nthat we oh-so-mature nonfreshmen have suddenly developed a sense of the \"importance<br />\nof higher education\"; it's just<br />\nthat we--or at least I--have<br />\ndiscovered that we can't just<br />\nhope to land on our feet after<br />\nwe graduate.

Little Murders is no exception.<br />\nThe play is set in the Newquists'<br />\nNew York apartment. Marjorie (Susan<br />\nWelsh) is flustered and excited; her<br />\ndaughter, Patsy (Holly Robbins), is<br />\nbringing her future fiance home to meet<br />\nthe family. Carol Newquist, patriarch of<br />\nthis band of eccentrics, is played by<br />\nTodd Rosen. Mr. Newquist is concerned<br />\nthat Patsy will bring home a homosexual,<br />\nfor the fifth time; in his considered<br />\n<br />\nopinion, she needs a \"real\" man, like her<br />\ndad, who smokes, drinks, fights and<br />\nhas a firm handshake. Their son, Kenny<br />\n(Lincoln Stein), cheerfully volunteers<br />\nalarming information with all the.enthusiasm of an adolescent younger brother,<br />\ndespite the fact that he is 22 and in<br />\ngraduate school.<br />\nPatsy finally arrives with Alfred,<br />\nportrayed by Rey Muradaz; she is obviously the darling of the family and the<br />\nmost normal person there. Alfred stands<br />\nabout, dazed and bruised; when an<br />\nalarmed Mrs. Newquist questions him<br />\nabout this, it is revealed that he usually<br />\nlooks like that. Alfred explains that he<br />\nlets muggers beat him up while he stands<br />\nquietly and daydreams, humming to<br />\nhimself. Things deteriorate rapidly as the<br />\nNewquists get to know Alfred and he<br />\n<br />\nCharlie Myers delivers a mellow monologue.<br />\n<br />\nproves to be too odd even for them.<br />\nAmong his other activities, he \"shoots<br />\nshit.\" See the play; you'll understand.<br />\nThe play centers around the<br />\nproblems inherent in Patsy and Alfred's<br />\nrelationship. Patsy claims to be tired of<br />\nalways being the strong one, of always<br />\nbeing in charge, but she needs Alfred's<br />\npassivity and defeatism. In her own<br />\nwords she wants \"a big, strong protective<br />\nman\" whom she can \"take care of.\"<br />\nAlfred has no desires; he is willing to<br />\nmarry Patsy simply because it offers the<br />\npath of least resistance. He repeatedly<br />\ninfuriates her by tuning out anything<br />\nwhich might present a source of conflict,<br />\nincluding his feelings.<br />\nThe struggle<br />\nbetween the two comes to a climax and a<br />\ncompletely unexpected resolution in the<br />\nsecond act.<br />\nThe performances are quite good.<br />\nSusan Welsh, as the mother,is charmingly<br />\nfey and superbly delivers rather pointed<br />\nlines with melt-in-your-mouth sweetness.<br />\nTodd Rosen handles certain aspects of the<br />\nfather's personality very well; he is able<br />\nto emphasize the character's doubts<br />\nabout his own masculinity without falling<br />\ninto caricature. Lincoln Stein is suitably<br />\nobnoxious as Kenny. Holly Robbins does<br />\nadmirably; the actress who originally<br />\nplayed Patsy left the play precipitously<br />\nand, although Ms. Robbins had been<br />\ngiven the script only three days before<br />\nopening, she presents a vivid and solid<br />\ncharacterization. Ray Muradaz does well<br />\nwith Alfred. Although he sometimes<br />\ncarries the detachment too far, he is<br />\ngenerally convincing. In the second act<br />\nhe produces a lovely bit of acting, when<br />\nAlfred lets his guard down and reveals<br />\nsome of his past.

He is nicknamed<br />\n<br />\nDonald Sutherland<br />\n<br />\n\"the Needle\" because of the thin knife he<br />\nuses to kill anyone who finds out what<br />\nhe's up to (we see at least four gruesome<br />\nstabbings during the course of the film).<br />\nIt is 1944: the Needle uncovers the big<br />\nsecret about the coming Allied invasion<br />\nof France,to take place in Normandy and<br />\nnot Calais.

Here's why and what can be<br />\ndone about it.<br />\nEach film series has developed its<br />\nown character over the years. Their<br />\nindividuality is, at least in part, determined by the financial resources of each<br />\ngroup. A film series on campus is,<br />\nideally, self-supporting; at the outset,<br />\neach group receives a sum of approximately 200 dollars for advertising. After<br />\nthat, each series pays the rental fees for<br />\neach film plus 50 to 65 percent of the<br />\nprofits. The rental fee is paid only after<br />\nthe film has been shown; therefore, it is<br />\n<br />\nunlikely that any series would ever<br />\noperate at a deficit. Rental of a film<br />\nranges in cost anywhere from 100 to<br />\nmore than 1000 dollars. The Reel World<br />\nand the Senior Class Film Series operate<br />\non a fairly small budget, spending only<br />\n100 to 200 dollars on rental per film.<br />\nThe low budget of the Reel World<br />\nis primarily due to the lack of popularity<br />\nof many of its more obscure films.<br />\nThis series formerly featured two avant<br />\ngarde films per week. But within the past<br />\nyear or two, the series coordinator<br />\n(currently Jeff Salmore) has selected<br />\nmore accessible films and decided to<br />\nshow only one per week, thereby increasing the audience and thus the profits.<br />\nThose profits go to the Chaplain's Office,<br />\nwhere they are used for such community<br />\nactivities as the Hopkins Tutorial Project.<br />\n<br />\nSo You Think<br />\nYou Got Talent?<br />\n<br />\nit ..,, \u2022,'' ,<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series is<br />\nlimited by the unpopularity of its viewing<br />\nroom. Shaffer 3 is notoriously uncomfortable, the sound is lousy,and the room<br />\nnever quite dispells the lecture hall aura.<br />\nJeff Salmore and Joy Straus run this<br />\nseries. For fear of losing money,only the<br />\nbest known foreign films are likely to be<br />\nshown in this series (e.g. La Cage awc<br />\nFolks). Better-known movies than in the<br />\nReel World series are seen here, though<br />\nnot as many \"blockbusters- as in the<br />\nremaining two series.<br />\nThe Weekend Wonder Flix series<br />\nalso operates from the Office of the<br />\nChaplain. The coordinator, Joy Straus,<br />\ntends to select films with reliable drawing<br />\npower, such as recent box-office hits<br />\nrather than risking many films of uncertain popularity. The series spent 400 to<br />\n600 dollars per film. Its profits, like<br />\nthose from the Reel World, are funneled<br />\nto the Office of the Chaplain, and go<br />\nmore toward the direct maintenance of<br />\nthe Office than to special projects. The<br />\nmovies in this series are shown in Shriver<br />\nor the Great Hall, alternating with the<br />\n.itudent Council Film Series.<br />\nThe SC Film Series is run by Sue<br />\nParkhurst and Wesley Stites and is sponsored, as the name suggests, by the<br />\nStudent Council. The coordinators have<br />\ngreat financial freedom in selecting films<br />\nbecause of the SC's sponsorship, but all<br />\nfunds from the Council are repaid with<br />\ninterest.<br />\nThis should give them the<br />\nfreedom to show quality films with less<br />\neconomic and more artistic appeal.<br />\n<br />\nExpenditures are approximately the same<br />\nas in the Weekend Wonder Flix - 400 to<br />\n600 dollars per film, so this series, more<br />\nthan any other, should bring the best of<br />\nrecent and popular movies.<br />\nThe problem is that the students<br />\nhave no influence on the selection of the<br />\nfilms. As the astute reader will have<br />\nnoticed, three of these series (the Reel<br />\nWorld, the Senior Class Film Series, and<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix) are run by two<br />\npeople: Jeff Salmore and Joy Straus.<br />\nDue to the scarcity of volunteers with<br />\nfilm experience, these two people select<br />\n75 percent of the movies you see on<br />\ncampus. Straus herself has admitted to<br />\nselecting the Weekend Wonder Flix<br />\naccording to her own tastes. It is obviously impossible for these people, as<br />\nfull-time students, to ask everyone on<br />\ncampus what films they would like to<br />\nsee. Therefore, we at the N-L have<br />\ndecided to take a poll of the student<br />\nbody to find out what movies you want<br />\n(see below). All of the coordinators, with<br />\nthe exception of Joy Straus, expressed a<br />\nstrong desire to see the results of such a<br />\npoll; we hope it will have a major influence on the movies chosen for second<br />\nsemester. The film schedule for next<br />\nspring has yet to be chosen, so here's<br />\nyour chance to tell the four chairpeople<br />\n(Salmore, Straus, Parkhurst, and Stites)<br />\nwhich films you want to see.

Bowie, the University's Vice President of<br />\nFinance and Treasurer, explained the process of financing<br />\na major project such as the new<br />\ndorms. \"Financing means a lot<br />\nof different things: knowing<br />\nwhere to go to either borrow or<br />\nput capital into place, creating<br />\na revenue stream to meet all<br />\nexpenses,\" he said.<br /><br />\nBuilding new dorms presents a tough problem for<br />\nUniversity officials because the<br />\nUniversity must raise all of the<br />\n$30 million itself.

Last year's firing of Marge<br />\nMareck, a veteran secretary who complained to the National Labor Relations<br />\nBoard about her salary, revealed the depth<br />\nof employee discontent at JHU: an employees association was formed, demonstrations were held, and a survey of employees<br />\nindicated strong dissatisfaction with pay,<br />\nhours, and employer treatment.<br />\nThe University's subsequent actions<br />\nmade clear its high-handed and arbitrary<br />\nattitude toward its employees. The issue<br />\nwas not primarily whether Mrs. Mareck was<br />\njustified in seeking a raise, or whether she<br />\nwas no longer working effectively, as her<br />\nsuperior, Dr. Galambos, charged in firing<br />\nher. What is important is that the University repeatedly rejected Mrs. Mareck's<br />\nplease for an objective grievance hearing.<br />\nHer case was reviewed privately by various<br />\nadministration members, and her final<br />\ndismissal was approved singlehandedly by<br />\nDean Suskind. In addition, the University<br />\nrefused to recognize the newly-formed<br />\nJohns Hopkins Employees Association, and<br />\nmade no response to that group's proposal<br /><br />\nfor an objective grievance procedure. The<br />\nexisting procedure states only that \"any<br />\nstaff member has the right...to present any<br />\npersonal concern or dissatisfaction regarding his or her employment, and have it<br />\nconsidered on its merits,\" but sets no<br />\nspecific guidelines after that. The supervisor of an employee with a grievance can<br />\nmeet with administration officials, without<br />\nthe employee in attendance. While a<br />\nUniversity \"personnel committee\" is currently looking into revising the existing<br />\ngrievance procedure, the committee has<br />\nrefused to include any employees as<br />\nmembers.

At first<br />\nglance, watching the socially<br />\nparanoid freshmen looks like an<br />\namusing topic, one that we<br />\ngrown-up sophomores could<br />\nlook upon condescendingly, secure in our knowledge of the<br />\ntrials and tribulations of the<br />\nacademic world. But the truth<br />\nof it is that this fall is even more<br />\ntraumatic than the last. Perhaps<br />\npart of it is because we know<br />\nwhat we're getting into, academically speaking. Sure, we know<br />\nall 'the latest dirt about which<br />\nclasses you can cut and which<br />\nyou can't, and who grades on a<br />\ncurve, and so on, but we also<br />\nknow how much is riding on the<br />\nnext few years. I'm not saying<br />\nthat we oh-so-mature nonfreshmen have suddenly developed a sense of the \"importance<br />\nof higher education\"; it's just<br />\nthat we--or at least I--have<br />\ndiscovered that we can't just<br />\nhope to land on our feet after<br />\nwe graduate.

Little Murders is no exception.<br />\nThe play is set in the Newquists'<br />\nNew York apartment. Marjorie (Susan<br />\nWelsh) is flustered and excited; her<br />\ndaughter, Patsy (Holly Robbins), is<br />\nbringing her future fiance home to meet<br />\nthe family. Carol Newquist, patriarch of<br />\nthis band of eccentrics, is played by<br />\nTodd Rosen. Mr. Newquist is concerned<br />\nthat Patsy will bring home a homosexual,<br />\nfor the fifth time; in his considered<br /><br />\nopinion, she needs a \"real\" man, like her<br />\ndad, who smokes, drinks, fights and<br />\nhas a firm handshake. Their son, Kenny<br />\n(Lincoln Stein), cheerfully volunteers<br />\nalarming information with all the.enthusiasm of an adolescent younger brother,<br />\ndespite the fact that he is 22 and in<br />\ngraduate school.<br />\nPatsy finally arrives with Alfred,<br />\nportrayed by Rey Muradaz; she is obviously the darling of the family and the<br />\nmost normal person there. Alfred stands<br />\nabout, dazed and bruised; when an<br />\nalarmed Mrs. Newquist questions him<br />\nabout this, it is revealed that he usually<br />\nlooks like that. Alfred explains that he<br />\nlets muggers beat him up while he stands<br />\nquietly and daydreams, humming to<br />\nhimself. Things deteriorate rapidly as the<br />\nNewquists get to know Alfred and he<br /><br />\nCharlie Myers delivers a mellow monologue.<br /><br />\nproves to be too odd even for them.<br />\nAmong his other activities, he \"shoots<br />\nshit.\" See the play; you'll understand.<br />\nThe play centers around the<br />\nproblems inherent in Patsy and Alfred's<br />\nrelationship. Patsy claims to be tired of<br />\nalways being the strong one, of always<br />\nbeing in charge, but she needs Alfred's<br />\npassivity and defeatism. In her own<br />\nwords she wants \"a big, strong protective<br />\nman\" whom she can \"take care of.\"<br />\nAlfred has no desires; he is willing to<br />\nmarry Patsy simply because it offers the<br />\npath of least resistance. He repeatedly<br />\ninfuriates her by tuning out anything<br />\nwhich might present a source of conflict,<br />\nincluding his feelings.<br />\nThe struggle<br />\nbetween the two comes to a climax and a<br />\ncompletely unexpected resolution in the<br />\nsecond act.<br />\nThe performances are quite good.<br />\nSusan Welsh, as the mother,is charmingly<br />\nfey and superbly delivers rather pointed<br />\nlines with melt-in-your-mouth sweetness.<br />\nTodd Rosen handles certain aspects of the<br />\nfather's personality very well; he is able<br />\nto emphasize the character's doubts<br />\nabout his own masculinity without falling<br />\ninto caricature. Lincoln Stein is suitably<br />\nobnoxious as Kenny. Holly Robbins does<br />\nadmirably; the actress who originally<br />\nplayed Patsy left the play precipitously<br />\nand, although Ms. Robbins had been<br />\ngiven the script only three days before<br />\nopening, she presents a vivid and solid<br />\ncharacterization. Ray Muradaz does well<br />\nwith Alfred. Although he sometimes<br />\ncarries the detachment too far, he is<br />\ngenerally convincing. In the second act<br />\nhe produces a lovely bit of acting, when<br />\nAlfred lets his guard down and reveals<br />\nsome of his past.

Most of this summer's hits are reminiscent of the films<br />\nturned out three and a half decades ago,<br />\nlike adventure serials(Raiders of the Lost<br />\nArk) and screwball comedies(Arthur). It<br />\nwas inevitable that before long we'd have<br />\nan authentic 1940's-style spy movie such<br />\nas The Eye of the Needle. Almost<br />\neverything about Needle, which is based<br />\non the bestselling novel by Ken Follett,<br />\nreeks of forties atmosphere and filmmaking technique, right down to the<br />\nlushly melodramatic score by Miklos<br />\nRozsa.<br />\nThe story centers on a Nazi spy<br />\n(Donald Sutherland) working in Britain<br />\nduring World War II. He is nicknamed<br /><br />\nDonald Sutherland<br /><br />\n\"the Needle\" because of the thin knife he<br />\nuses to kill anyone who finds out what<br />\nhe's up to (we see at least four gruesome<br />\nstabbings during the course of the film).<br />\nIt is 1944: the Needle uncovers the big<br />\nsecret about the coming Allied invasion<br />\nof France,to take place in Normandy and<br />\nnot Calais. The Needle must present the<br />\nevidence to Hitler in person.

Quite naturally, the woman<br />\nfalls in love with the handsome stranger.<br />\nThe suspense builds. Will she find out<br />\nhe's a spy?

Much of the trouble lies in the<br />\nfilm's attitude: it takes itself too seriously. Most good thrillers are sprinkled<br />\nwith humor, often of the gallows variety.<br />\nTwo examples are particularly memorable: the who's-been-bitten-by-more-fish<br />\nbragging contest in Jaws and Indiana<br /><br />\nNeedle feeds information to Nazis through Dinette set.<br /><br />\nJones' ladylove telling him, after a<br />\nspectacular gunfight, \"You sure know<br />\nhow to show a girl a good time\" in<br />\nRaiders. Such wit not only is entertaining in itself, but it also short-circuits the<br />\nimpulse to chuckle at a rriovie's highly<br />\nwrought scenes. Needle lacks even a hint<br />\nof levity, insuring that the more cynical<br />\nof its viewers will chortle if the director<br />\npushes the drama slightly too hard.<br />\nThe Eye of the Needle is far from<br />\nworthless, but four dollars a head is a<br />\nhigh price to pay for run-of-the-mill<br />\nentertainment. Wait until this one conies to<br />\nthe tube.<br />\nThe Eye of the Needle is now<br />\nshowing at the Playhouse (Charles and<br />\n25th Streets).<br /><br />\nHopkins' Film Series:Who's in Control?<br />\nBY SUZANNE CONKLIN<br />\nOver the past few years the<br />\nHopkins community has been subjected<br />\nto the same stock films chosen over and<br />\nover again by the, various film series on<br />\ncampus. Here's why and what can be<br />\ndone about it.<br />\nEach film series has developed its<br />\nown character over the years. Their<br />\nindividuality is, at least in part, determined by the financial resources of each<br />\ngroup. A film series on campus is,<br />\nideally, self-supporting; at the outset,<br />\neach group receives a sum of approximately 200 dollars for advertising. After<br />\nthat, each series pays the rental fees for<br />\neach film plus 50 to 65 percent of the<br />\nprofits. The rental fee is paid only after<br />\nthe film has been shown; therefore, it is<br /><br />\nunlikely that any series would ever<br />\noperate at a deficit. Rental of a film<br />\nranges in cost anywhere from 100 to<br />\nmore than 1000 dollars. The Reel World<br />\nand the Senior Class Film Series operate<br />\non a fairly small budget, spending only<br />\n100 to 200 dollars on rental per film.<br />\nThe low budget of the Reel World<br />\nis primarily due to the lack of popularity<br />\nof many of its more obscure films.<br />\nThis series formerly featured two avant<br />\ngarde films per week. But within the past<br />\nyear or two, the series coordinator<br />\n(currently Jeff Salmore) has selected<br />\nmore accessible films and decided to<br />\nshow only one per week, thereby increasing the audience and thus the profits.<br />\nThose profits go to the Chaplain's Office,<br />\nwhere they are used for such community<br />\nactivities as the Hopkins Tutorial Project.<br /><br />\nSo You Think<br />\nYou Got Talent?<br /><br />\nit ..,, \u2022,'' ,<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series is<br />\nlimited by the unpopularity of its viewing<br />\nroom. Shaffer 3 is notoriously uncomfortable, the sound is lousy,and the room<br />\nnever quite dispells the lecture hall aura.<br />\nJeff Salmore and Joy Straus run this<br />\nseries. For fear of losing money,only the<br />\nbest known foreign films are likely to be<br />\nshown in this series (e.g. La Cage awc<br />\nFolks). Better-known movies than in the<br />\nReel World series are seen here, though<br />\nnot as many \"blockbusters- as in the<br />\nremaining two series.<br />\nThe Weekend Wonder Flix series<br />\nalso operates from the Office of the<br />\nChaplain. The coordinator, Joy Straus,<br />\ntends to select films with reliable drawing<br />\npower, such as recent box-office hits<br />\nrather than risking many films of uncertain popularity. The series spent 400 to<br />\n600 dollars per film. Its profits, like<br />\nthose from the Reel World, are funneled<br />\nto the Office of the Chaplain, and go<br />\nmore toward the direct maintenance of<br />\nthe Office than to special projects. The<br />\nmovies in this series are shown in Shriver<br />\nor the Great Hall, alternating with the<br />\n.itudent Council Film Series.<br />\nThe SC Film Series is run by Sue<br />\nParkhurst and Wesley Stites and is sponsored, as the name suggests, by the<br />\nStudent Council. The coordinators have<br />\ngreat financial freedom in selecting films<br />\nbecause of the SC's sponsorship, but all<br />\nfunds from the Council are repaid with<br />\ninterest.<br />\nThis should give them the<br />\nfreedom to show quality films with less<br />\neconomic and more artistic appeal.<br /><br />\nExpenditures are approximately the same<br />\nas in the Weekend Wonder Flix - 400 to<br />\n600 dollars per film, so this series, more<br />\nthan any other, should bring the best of<br />\nrecent and popular movies.<br />\nThe problem is that the students<br />\nhave no influence on the selection of the<br />\nfilms. As the astute reader will have<br />\nnoticed, three of these series (the Reel<br />\nWorld, the Senior Class Film Series, and<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix) are run by two<br />\npeople: Jeff Salmore and Joy Straus.<br />\nDue to the scarcity of volunteers with<br />\nfilm experience, these two people select<br />\n75 percent of the movies you see on<br />\ncampus. Straus herself has admitted to<br />\nselecting the Weekend Wonder Flix<br />\naccording to her own tastes. It is obviously impossible for these people, as<br />\nfull-time students, to ask everyone on<br />\ncampus what films they would like to<br />\nsee. Therefore, we at the N-L have<br />\ndecided to take a poll of the student<br />\nbody to find out what movies you want<br />\n(see below). All of the coordinators, with<br />\nthe exception of Joy Straus, expressed a<br />\nstrong desire to see the results of such a<br />\npoll; we hope it will have a major influence on the movies chosen for second<br />\nsemester. The film schedule for next<br />\nspring has yet to be chosen, so here's<br />\nyour chance to tell the four chairpeople<br />\n(Salmore, Straus, Parkhurst, and Stites)<br />\nwhich films you want to see. If too few<br />\npeople return this form, we, the silent<br />\nhordes of film-watchers, will once again<br />\nbe subjected to the whims of that select<br />\ntyrants!<br />\nelite<br />\nseries<br />\nof<br />\nfilm<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nQuestionnaire<br />\n-1<br /><br />\n1/<br /><br />\n4.<br /><br />\nWe need you to write,draw,<br />\nphotograph, lay-out,<br />\nsell ads, etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />\nZeniada<br />\nFirst meeting:<br />\nBusiness with Pleasure Party!<br />\nFor Old Staff and Interested NEW Staff.<br />\nSunday, Sept. 12 9:00 3-G Wolman<br />\nBe there, Aloha.<br /><br />\nFill this out, drop it off at the Gatehouse or in Campus Mail Box 1230, and<br />\nyour kind of film is shown this year!<br />\n1.

I still go to just as many<br />\ngames.\" Three neighborhood<br />\nkids said that they're not going<br />\nto as many games, but they<br />\ndidn't care about the strike.<br />\nAnother lamented, \"The enthusiasm isn't there.\" A third said,<br />\n\"rni still going to as many<br />\ngames. I love baseball and enjoy<br />\nit. however, my interest was<br />\ngreater last. year.\"<br />\nMany fans' love for the<br />\ngame has diminished, if only<br />\ntemporarily. One commented,<br />\n\"The teams who won the first<br />\nhalf aren't playing that hard. I<br />\nthink most people are going to<br />\nforget about the strike next<br />\nyear. The fans forget easily.\"<br />\nAn eight-year employee of ABC<br />\nSports notes that \"people are<br />\nstill mad about the strike.\" He<br />\nadded, \"They'll get over it.<br />\nThey'll forget about the strike.\"<br />\nBut sonic won't forget easily. To the right of the advance<br />\nsales window, a woman stands<br />\nselling souvenir programs. She<br />\nhas been employed at Memorial<br />\nStadium since 1969. During the<br />\noff-season, she works- as a<br />\nteacher. However, she depends<br />\nupon the 4,000 dollars she<br />\nused to bring home each summer. She commented, \"I used<br />\nto make twenty .to thirty dollars<br />\na night. Now it's down to<br />\nfifteen dollars. Her enthusiasm<br />\nhas also dropped. \"I used to<br />\nstay for the game. Now I leave<br />\nafter the fifth inning.\"<br />\nWhen she leaves, the parking<br />\nlot attendants enter the stadium.<br />\nMost are retired civil servants<br />\nwho would do their jobs without<br />\npay. One attendant commented.<br />\n\"During the strike I was out of<br />\nwork. I suffered, but I was for<br />\nthe players. I still root as hard<br />\nfor the Orioles.<br />\nBut other<br />\npeople just aren't coming out<br />\nthe way they used to.\"<br />\nA traffic cop also observed<br />\nthe effect of the strike upon the<br />\nfans.<br />\n\"Crowds ,are smaller.<br />\nThe spirit's not there. This<br />\nhomestand was .fifteen days long<br />\nand only two or three days was<br />\nthere a crowd with any enthusiasm. A lot of the regulars, who<br />\ngo to nine out of ten.games,just<br />\naren't coming out. Somebody<br />\nelse is coming in with their<br />\npasses. \\If the Orioles get back<br />\ninto first place and challenge the<br />\nYankees for the second half<br /><br />\nchampionship, the people may<br />\ncome back.\" He added, \"Last<br />\nweek, we had to put a one-way<br />\npattern in during the sixth<br />\ninning. We're supposed to do<br />\nthat towards the end of the<br />\ngame. People left like the place<br />\nwas on fire. They were disgusted. They're not playing that<br />\nwell. Baltimore won't support a<br />\nloser.\"<br />\nBut Baltimore has to support the businesses around the<br />\nstadium.<br />\nAlong the Orioles'<br />\nroute on 33rd Street lies<br />\nTugboat Annie's, the \"campus\"<br />\npitzza place where there has been<br />\nno significant decrease in business during the strike. \"We get<br />\nvery busy if there's a big crowd.<br />\nIf the crowd isn't over. 25,000,it<br />\ndoesn't do us a whole lot of<br />\ngood.<br />\nHopkins and Loyola<br />\nbeing out of session hurt us<br />\nmore than not !laving the Orioles<br />\nat the stadium.<br />\nAcross Greenmount Avenue<br />\nlies the Stadium Lounge, the<br />\nmain watering hole for fans<br />\nbefore and after games. According to the woman who tends bar,<br />\n\"During the strike we lost<br />\nbusiness. Since it ended, not as<br />\nmany people are coming in as<br />\nbefore.<br />\nCertain people will<br />\ncome in no matter what, but we<br />\ndon't get the big crowds like we<br />\nused to. Sonic people who said<br />\nthey wouldn't come back after<br />\nthe strike have come back.<br />\nEventually, I imagine it will pick<br />\nup.\"<br />\nDiagonally up the street is<br />\nSubway, which lost 10 to 15<br />\npercent of its business during the<br />\nstrike. \"When the strike was<br />\nsettled, business returned to a<br />\ndegree, but we're still down two<br />\nto three percent,\" said the<br />\nproprietor. \"Business is good<br />\nconsidering the people aren't<br />\ngoing to baseball games.\"<br />\nFew<br />\npeople understand<br />\nwhat the strike was about.<br />\nHowever, most of the fans and<br />\nvendors at Memorial Stadium<br />\nbacked the players. A vendor<br />\nremarked, \"This country has a<br />\nstrike mentality. Rather than<br />\nnegotiating first, people strike.<br />\nThe players had the right to<br />\nstrike just like anyone else.\"<br />\nThe strike curiously ended<br />\nAugust 9, just as the owners'<br />\ninsurance money ran out. In<br />\nfact, teams that draw poorly,<br />\nsuch as Minnesota and Seattle,<br />\nbenefitted during the strike. For<br /><br />\nthese teams, $100,000 per game<br />\ninsurance money surpassed their<br />\nnormal gate receipts.<br />\nThe players, unpaid for over<br />\ntwo months, were forced to rely<br />\non savings. The majority of<br />\nthem earn six-figure salaries and<br />\nhardly suffered, though rookies<br />\nand utility players were hurt.<br />\nHowever, all of them supported<br />\nthe strike because they were<br />\nfighting for the right to move<br />\nfreely to the team of their<br />\nchoice after six years in baseball.<br />\nUntil this year, a player was<br />\nfree to move to any team he<br />\nwished without his former team<br />\nreceiving any compensation.<br />\nUnder the new agreement, teams<br />\nlosing premier free agents (rated<br />\nby their position) will receive a<br /><br />\nThe Board of Intramural<br />\nAthletics is looking forward to<br />\nanother full year of student<br />\nparticipation.
