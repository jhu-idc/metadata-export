Half a<br />\nmillion volumes have already<br />\nbeen transferred to Gilman<br />\nHall stacks, but the library<br />\nreceives 30,000 books yearly,<br />\nOne solution under consideration is storing books on<br />\ncomputer discs. These discs<br />\nwhich resemble long-playing<br />\nrecords, would be entered into<br />\nthe Library of Congress cornputer. Hopkins and 3000 other<br />\nlibraries share information<br />\nwithin this computer system.<br />\nOnce the disc is stored, any person connected with Hopkins<br />\nwould be able to call up the<br />\nbook he needs and \"flip\"<br />\nthrough the pages.<br />\n\"This is all hypothetical,\"<br />\nsaid Martin. \"It hasn't been<br />\ndone yet.\" Computer disc book<br />\nstorage may happen in 20 years<br />\nor so, a time when more peo-<br />\n<br />\npie will have access to terminals.<br />\nWhile storing books on computer discs is far in the future,<br />\na computerized card catalog is<br />\ncurrently nearing completion.<br />\nThe conversion, begun by iibrary staff in 1974, should be<br />\nfinished some time in 1985.<br />\nThe library plans to acquire<br />\na smaller computer which will<br />\ncopy information contained in<br />\nthe larger Library of Congress<br />\nsystem.

Within a week following the Student Council's request for rectification of an unfair situation whereby<br />\nMcCoy Hall freshmen have been charged<br />\nunreasonably high rents, Associate Dean for<br />\nAdministration, Norm Krueger and Director of Auxiliary Enterprises, Bettye Miller<br />\nhammered out a new policy to take effect<br />\nnext year. While not all of the Student Council's demands were met, the recent solution<br />\nis not only practical but fair.<br />\nThe issue arose with the Student Council<br />\nHousing Committee's discovery that 30<br />\nfreshmen living in McCoy Hall pay $145<br />\nmore in rent than those undergraduates in<br />\nthe dormitories. Their residence in offcampus housing is not by choice, but rather,<br />\nis the result of a freshman population in excess of available dormitory space. The administration originally defended the policy<br />\nbY pointing out that all incoming freshmen<br />\nreceived notification of the possibility that<br />\nthey would be placed in higher-priced, offcampus dwellings in the event of an<br />\noverflow. All freshmen did indeed sign contracts consenting to this procedure.<br />\nHowever, as SC Housing Committee Chairman Mike Kun commented, \"Just because<br />\nit's in a contract doesn't mean it's fair.\" In<br />\nthe first place, students must sign the contract if they wish to attend Hopkins. Secondly, it is clear that the undergraduates in<br />\nMcCoy are not satisfied with their situation.<br />\nThe administration originally believed that<br />\nthe extra rent charge was justified on the<br />\ngrounds that the McCoy apartments contain<br />\ncooking facilities. Yet only three of the 30<br />\n<br />\nStudents Should Oppose Aid And Draft Plan<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing to you to discuss<br />\nthe Solomon Amendment to<br />\nthe Military Selective Service<br />\nAct. The Solomon Amendment<br />\nis intended to deny federally<br />\nsupported financial aid to those<br />\nstudents who have not registered for the draft. This<br />\nrepresents a serious threat to<br />\nour institutions of higher<br />\neducation and to many of the<br />\npeople within them.<br />\nPlease understand that registration itself is not the central<br />\nissue here. I do not intend to<br />\ndebate that, because this bill<br />\nfalters on its own demerits. It<br />\ndiscriminates on the basis of<br />\nage, sex and economic position.<br />\nIt violates the Constitution by<br />\nlegislating both a pronounce-.<br />\nment of guilt and the corresponding punishment without<br />\ngranting a court trial. It also<br />\nviolates the Fifth Amendment<br />\nby requiring students to indicate whether or not they have<br />\nregistered. These are dangerous<br />\nflaws that we must not allow to<br />\ncontinue. For these reasons and<br />\nothers, the Solomon Amendment is being challenged in the<br />\ncourts in Minnesota.

Financial constraints render such a response impossible. However, the Student Council's<br />\ncall for a policy revision for next year<br />\ngenerated surprisingly speedy action.

This is due to the<br />\nperception that the Student Council is unimportant and doesn't do very much. While it<br />\nis true that the powers of the council are<br />\nlimited, it is essential that the best people be<br />\nput in office in order to maximize effectiveness. The office of the presidency demands<br />\nthe most consideration. It is the president<br />\nthat sets the agenda and determines the direction that the council will pursue. This year<br />\nthree students are vying for the top position.<br />\nAll three offer contrasting viewpoints and<br />\nperspectives.<br />\nThe candidate that appears least capable<br />\nof serving student interests is Eric Fink, who<br />\nis running on a platform endorsing student<br />\napathy. While Fink often speaks of laudable<br />\ngoals, his party, GASP!, offers so many inconsistent statements that it is unclear what<br />\nFink intends to do if elected.<br />\nMaureen Freed bases her platform on the<br />\nneed to reform the administration and<br />\nmechanisms of student government at Hopkins. She is interested in revising the Student<br />\nCouncil committee structure in order to give<br />\nmore attention to issues such as financial aid.<br />\nShe also intends to mend animosities be-<br />\n<br />\ndecision, however. There are<br />\nschools across the country that<br />\nare instituting those policies<br />\nalready. The students who are<br />\ndenied aid may lose that opportunity forever. These young<br />\nmen are our friends and classmates and their punishment will<br />\nbe a loss not only for them but<br />\nfor the whole University. It is<br />\nfor this reason that the Hopkins<br />\nStudent Council needs to take<br />\na stand against this law. The<br />\nsilence they have chosen to<br />\nmaintain is counter to the interests of the students they are<br />\nsupposed to represent. Petitions<br />\nare being circulated on campus<br />\nurging the Student Council to<br />\nactively oppose the Solomon<br />\nAmendment. You can take part<br />\nby signing or by circulating one<br />\nyourself. Just ask for one when<br />\nsomeone approaches you to<br />\nsign. Letters to congressmen<br />\ncan also be quite effective<br />\nbecause Congress can still<br />\nrevoke the law before it goes into effect. Please join us in<br />\nwhatever way you can in our<br />\ndrive to prevent this bad law<br />\nfrom damaging our friends and<br />\nour schools.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, Freed's primary objective is to<br />\nestablish better communication between the<br />\nStudent Council and the undergraduate<br />\nbody. She hopes to establish procedures by<br />\nwhich all student complaints are formally<br />\nconsidered by council. Undergraduates who<br />\nare concerned about a communication gap<br />\nbetween students and student government<br />\nshould cast their vote for Freed.<br />\nThe News-Letter, however, believes that<br />\nthe candidate best suited to serve student<br />\nneeds is the incumbent, Doug Fellman. Unlike Freed, who views the president's role as<br />\na mediator in resolving student problems,<br />\nFellman is more concerned with representing<br />\nstudent concerns in the broader framework<br />\nof the University. Fellman's primary objective is to generate greater concern for<br />\nundergraduate education among the faculty and administration. He is therefore concerned with issues such as curriculum review<br />\nand tenure reform. Because of the broader<br />\nframework in which he places student<br />\ngovernment, as well as his year's worth of<br />\nexperience, the News-Letter gives its endorsement to Doug Fellman for Student Council<br />\npresident.<br />\n<br />\ntegrity and excellence it deserves, or just don't cover it at<br />\nall.

The circular continues, however, to state that<br />\n\"most Hopkins studens fit into this category.\" This is contrary to fact.<br />\nThe survey administered last<br />\nweek by the Pre-Law Society<br />\nreveals that while 85 percent of<br />\nHopkins pre-meds did choose<br />\nmedicine in high school or<br />\nearlier, only 28 percent of the<br />\nrest of the student body entered<br />\nHopkins with solidly defined<br />\nlong-term goals. The remaining<br />\n72 percent either have made or<br />\nwill make that decision while at<br />\nHopkins. This underscores the<br />\nnecessity of providing a comprehensive support system for<br />\ncareer development.<br />\nCurrently, the network of<br />\nservices available to pre-meds is<br />\nfairly comprehensive.

Questions<br />\nare answered before they even<br />\narise.<br />\nThe situation is very different<br />\nfor other pre-professionals.<br />\nTheir support services are seriously deficient in several areas.<br />\nThe most glaring omission in<br />\nthe present system is the lack of<br />\nadvising and information for<br />\nundergrads interested in pursuing graduate study. Although<br />\nmany departments have accumulated information on graduate programs at other universities, these are in general not<br />\norganized and students are not<br />\ninformed of their availability.<br />\nPeople interested in legal<br />\ncareers are somewhat better<br />\noff. They at least have their<br />\nown adviser, and they do have<br />\nresources of printed information to draw upon.<br />\nHowever, last week's survey<br />\nrevealed a serious underutilization of existing pre-law<br />\nresources at Hopkins, resources<br />\nwhich would seem to hold a<br />\ngreat deal of potential for<br />\nfacilitating 'career decisions.<br />\nAdvising staff should work to<br />\nexpand knowledge of and access to these resources.<br />\nConsider law-related internships, for example.

PASSANO<br />\nBefore discussing the social<br />\nactivities of the 1920s, it<br />\nmight be well to first describe<br />\nthe campus itself since drastic<br />\nchanges have taken place in<br />\nthe past 60 years. In the early<br />\n1920s, there were only six<br />\nbuildings on campus: Gilman<br />\nHall, the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding, the Mechanical<br />\nEngineering Building, the<br />\nPowerhouse, the Carroll<br />\nMansion and the Barn. There<br />\nwere no dormitories, no student activities building and<br />\nthe library was on the first<br />\nfloor of Gilman Hall.<br />\nThere were approximately<br />\n700 all male students on the<br />\ncampus, of which two-thirds<br />\nlived in Baltimore and its<br />\nsuburbs. They had attended<br />\nprep school in Baltimore and<br />\ntherefore, to them, going to<br />\ncollege was simply an extension of the life which they had<br />\nbeen used to living. They<br />\ncame to the University in the<br />\nmorning by way of the<br />\nCharles Street bus or the St.<br />\nPaul Street streetcar and in<br />\nthe afternoon returned home<br />\nby the same means. Few students owned automobiles,<br />\nbut those who did found ample parking close to their<br />\nclasses.<br />\nSixteen fraternities (nine<br />\nnational and seven local)<br />\n<br />\nowned houses within walking<br />\ndistance of the campus, and<br />\n40 percent of the student<br />\nbody belonged to a fraternity. Fraternity houses supplied<br />\nroom and board to perhaps<br />\n100 students, and the nonfraternity men who came<br />\nfrom parts of Maryland too<br />\nfar from Baltimore for<br />\ncommuting, and the few from<br />\nout-of-state, found lodging<br />\nnear the Homewood campus.<br />\nIt would not be accurate,<br />\nhowever, to suggest that the<br />\nsocial life of Baltimore was<br />\nfor all intents and purpose the<br />\nsocial life of the Johns Hopkins' students in the early<br />\n1920s, since the campus did<br />\nmost definitely have a life of<br />\nits own. The Barn was the<br />\ncenter of student activity.<br />\nMany ate their lunch at the<br />\nBarn, although most who<br />\nwere members of a fraternity<br />\nate lunch at their fraternity<br />\nhouse.<br />\nOf course the student body<br />\nturned out in force to cheer<br />\nthe home team when it played<br />\n(football in the fall, lacrosse<br />\nin the spring) at Homewood<br />\nField. Attendance was compulsory for freshman, who<br />\nwere not allowed to bring a<br />\ndate.<br />\nUpperclassmen,<br />\nhowever, could and did bring<br />\ntheir dates and took them to<br />\nthe Tea Dance held in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Building<br />\n<br />\nwhich always followed the<br />\ngame. In the spring, the girls<br />\nwore their new Easter finery<br />\nand a veritable fashion show<br />\nwould take place as they<br />\nwalked to their seats in the<br />\nstands. When a swimming<br />\nmeet was held at the pool of<br />\nthe Baltimore Athletic Club,<br />\na Tea Dance was also held<br />\nafter the meet.<br />\nDancing was very popular<br />\nin the '20s. The Waltz, the<br />\nFox Trot and the Two Step<br />\nwere the dances and cheek-tocheek dancing was the style.<br />\nThe Cotillion Club arranged<br />\nthe dances. The Tea Dances<br />\nwere informal with the music<br />\nsupplied by a student orchestra called the Blue Jays.<br />\nThe evening dances, including<br />\nthe Junior Prom and the<br />\nSenior Prom, were quite formal, dance cards were filled<br />\nout, the girls wore long<br />\ndresses and the men dressed<br />\nblack tie. The dances were<br />\nusually held at the Maryland<br />\nCasualty Auditorium (torn<br />\ndown) and a full orchestra<br />\nwas engaged. In addition to<br />\nthe dances arranged by the<br />\nCotillion Club, the leading<br />\nfraternities held an annual<br />\ndance and competed with<br />\neach other for the most<br />\npopular debutantes and<br />\nsubdebs.<br />\nA count of social activities<br />\non the campus would not be<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\ncomplete withodt listing the<br />\nseveral organizations of<br />\nspecial interest, all of which<br />\nhad substantial membership<br />\nand which developed programs furthering the aims<br />\nand purposes of their<br />\nmembership.

Meteorologists,*says Benton, look at<br />\nweather on the global scale and<br />\nconcentrate on large scale circulation of air mass and atmospheric changes.

When<br />\none post-doctoral researcher<br />\nwas asked if the emphasis on<br />\nresearch at Hopkins was beneficial to him, he replied,<br />\n\"That's why I'm here.\" But<br />\nhow many students have ever<br />\nseen a post-doc? According to<br />\nthe Registrar, there are normally 100 to 120 post-docs at<br />\nHomewood, although the offices of deans Suskind and<br />\nBrush say there are only 76 in<br />\nthe School of Arts and Sciences<br />\nand six in Engineering at the<br />\npresent time. So where are these<br />\nunseen individuals?<br />\nDr. Tim Duelfer, who completed his post-doctoral work in<br />\nthe Division of Radiation<br />\nHealth at the School of Hygiene, says, \"They are in their<br />\nlabs. They put in long hours<br />\nand are expected to get a lot<br />\ndone.\" Post-docs tend to work<br />\nhard, either because they<br />\nworried about their careers or<br />\nthey work for an active professor who demands that a lot<br />\nof time be spent in the lab.<br />\nPost-doc work is similar to<br />\ngraduate school in the amount<br />\nof work done and in the pay.<br />\nPost-doctoral positions are<br />\nusually obtained with a friend<br />\nof a graduate student's thesis<br />\nadviser or by writing to some-<br />\n<br />\none the student is interested in.<br />\nMany openings for post-doctoral positions are advertised in<br />\nprofessional magazines such as<br />\nChemical Engineering News<br />\nand Science, etc. According to<br />\nDuelfer, \"Post-doc work is<br />\nusually done in the same field<br />\na person has been in or closely<br />\nrelated to it, the farther away [a'<br />\npost-doctoral position Is from<br />\na person's Ph.D. field] the<br />\ntougher it is to get into.\"<br />\nAlthough some post-doctoral<br />\nfellowships are offered for two<br />\nyears, most are initially for one<br />\nyear with the possible extension<br />\nto a second year, contingent<br />\nupon the mutual satisfaction of<br />\nthe post-doc and his supervisor.<br />\nPost-doctoral positions are<br />\npredominantly at research universities and government laboratories, but some are available<br />\nin industry. The industrial positions usually involve being<br />\nhired at the Ph.D. level for low<br />\npay with no guarantee of<br />\nrenewal. They are even less<br />\ndesirable because they result in<br />\nfewer publications. The major<br />\ncomplaint among post-does is<br />\nthe poor pay. Yearly salaries<br />\naverage about $13,000.,<br />\nFrom the employer's Point of<br />\nview, a post-doctoral researcher<br />\nis a pair of hands with a brain<br />\nattached. Post-docs usually<br />\nwork on part of a new project<br />\nwhich has been funded or on an<br />\nexisting project. Grant proposals often include requests<br />\n<br />\nfor post-doe's salaries. But<br />\nthere is also a lot of leeway for<br />\na post-doe to investigate other<br />\nareas in which he might be<br />\ninterested.<br />\nFrom the view of the postdoe, the work is almost like an<br />\n\"apprenticeship,\" according to<br />\nDuelfer. \"[The idea is to] go to<br />\nwork for someone who is fairly famous, and by working<br />\nhard establish a name for<br />\nyourself.\" Duelfer also says a<br />\npost-doe's position \"is what<br />\nyou make out of it\"; it can be<br />\na rewarding experience or it can<br />\nbe just another job. Dr. John<br />\nLever, who enjoys his post-doc<br />\nwork for Dr. Gary Posner, believes, \"It's a great opportunity, you're able to do research<br />\nfor research's sake and can<br />\nwork on many different projects; there's no press to concentrate on one subject like a<br />\nthesis.\"<br />\nUndergraduates have little<br />\ncontact with post-doctoral researchers with the exception of<br />\nthose whose undergraduate research is in a lab with a postdoe. While post-does technically have no teaching duties, they,<br />\nin fact, often do TA's work and<br />\noccasionally lecture, especially<br />\nif they enjoy teaching. When<br />\nasked if post-does should be<br />\nmore active in undergraduate<br />\neducation, Duelfer replied,<br />\n\"No, they usually teach in<br />\ngraduate school, and they have<br />\nplenty to do as it is.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fB's and C's<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nThe Theory Of Giving And Grading Exams<br />\na straight scale.

This hangout was called Second Story Bookstore(downtown)and it<br />\nseemed to promise much used- and newbook sections, a record shop, the Empire Lounge and various poetry readings. It also had the City Paper's praise.<br />\nLast summer, owner Alan Stipeck<br />\nabruptly closed down Second Story,<br />\nangrily claiming that \"Baltimoreans<br />\ndon't read.\" I'm not qualified to<br />\nevaluate his declaration of urban illiteracy (or more likely, illiterati) but,<br />\nconsidering the trash in most Baltimore<br />\nbookstores, I don't doubt it.<br />\nTaking a tour of Baltimore's bookstores can be sobering. Starting up<br />\nnorth, the first store I came to was<br />\nTowson Books (by Hutzler's, on York<br />\nRoad). Towson has schlock y studenttype books: some anthropology, some<br />\npsychology, lots of Cliff Notes, etc.<br />\nThere is a large sci-fi collection (larger<br />\nthan the aforementioned sections combined) and lots of romances, mysteries<br />\nand general fiction. There is also a surprisingly extensive literature section, in<br />\nfact one of the best in town. There is a<br />\ndiscount on hard-cover books.<br />\nMoving west I came to Upstairs<br />\nBooks (in Mt. Washington, on Sulgrave<br />\nAvenue). \"Sale,\" the sign said, and all<br />\nused books\u2014how could I stop myself<br />\nfrom giving 'it a look? After a quick<br />\nglance, I realized that I'd rather have<br />\nbeen in a checkout line at Giant. This<br />\nplace was a second-rate Second Story<br />\n<br />\n_\u2022<br />\n\"1\"\"\"\"\"7,\"9\"\"IlkIrrr\"\"\"us<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nr \"OW<br />\n<br />\nWhere's Beck',?<br />\n<br />\n(uptown): lots of garbage(romances and<br />\ngeneral dopey fiction) and no psychology, sociology or philosophy books to<br />\nspeak of(I have a larger selection in my<br />\napartment). The \"sale\" was, in fact, a<br />\nscheme to clear out their oversupply of<br />\nromances and fiction. There was a perfunctory section of sci-fi and some<br />\nreference books, and even a history section which was close to passing muster.<br />\nI can see no reason for going to this<br />\nbookstore except maybe to sober up<br />\ncoming from the Mt. Washington<br />\nTavern.<br />\nNext stop: the Rotunda, and a real<br />\njewel of a shop. Gordon's looks like it'll<br />\nbe stocked with flash and trash, but by<br />\nall means look again. An interesting fiction section, cookbooks, crafts, kiddie<br />\nbooks, plus the only copy of The Panda's Thumb I've seen in Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\nAn alternathe to Barnes & Noble, and much closer to Subways.<br />\n<br />\nThere is surprisingly good selection<br />\nthroughout the store (not much depth,<br />\nbut new books) and the staff is friendly. They will order books, and they take<br />\nchecks. Go there instead of Horn &<br />\nHorn; the selection is bigger and better<br />\nfor you at Gordon's. Note that the same<br />\ngoes for the Gordon's at Harbor Place,<br />\nbut to a lesser degree.<br />\nNo bookstore itinerary in town is<br />\ncomplete without Barnes & Noble. Boo,<br />\nhiss, I can hear you now. Let's face it,<br />\nthough; it's convenient, it sells a wide<br />\nrange of books, and it's a Barnes & Noble (for those of you who don't know,<br />\nBarnes & Noble is a huge chain of bookstores operating out of New York). In<br />\nfact, I was surprised to learn that our<br />\nown Barnes & Noble is the second<br />\nlargest collegiate Barnes & Noble in the<br />\ncountry (right behind Columbia's). And<br />\nit is frankly an awesome bookstore, a<br />\nplace I would feel compelled to return<br />\nto even if it wasn't on campus. It beats<br />\nhell out of Follett's; they let you read<br />\nall the magazines without buying them,<br />\nand will order books for you. This is<br />\nbeyond a doubt the best academic<br />\nbookstore in Baltimore (though they<br />\nlack a hearty used-book section) so enjoy it. If you have questions while<br />\nyou're there, ask for Becky.<br />\nFor a brief stop, consider the 31st<br />\nStreet Card and Book Shop (on St.<br />\nPaul). Don't be fooled by the \"used<br />\nbooks\" sign, because you probably<br />\nwouldn't want these books for free, let<br />\nalone half-price. Look for neat fiction,<br />\nliterature, sci-fi and hobby books, some<br />\nof which you can find in earlier (read:<br />\ncheaper) editions than elsewhere.<br />\nAlthough Second Story downtown is<br />\nclosed, Stipeck must still believe in us<br />\nnorthern Baltimoreans. Second Story<br />\nBooks (33rd & Greenmount) is always<br />\na treat. Selling almost all used books, it<br />\nprovides a selection of drama, art<br />\nbooks, philosophy, psychology, sociology and history/political science unequaled anywhere else in the city at any<br />\nprice. Since Second Story buys collections, the stock always varies but<br />\nmanages to sustain its good selection<br />\nnonetheless. I've spent much time and<br />\nmoney in this store and will continue to<br />\ndo so if possible(some books I've found<br />\nthere include Boring's History of Experimental Psychology, Cushman's A<br />\nBeginner's History of Philosophy, and<br />\nGerth and Mills' classic From Max<br />\nWeber). I suggest that you look for<br />\ncourse books here before Barnes & Noble, and keep coming back to browse.<br />\nAt 518 N. Charles, Louie's is the store<br />\nwhich drove Second Story out of business downtown, and no wonder. This<br />\nplace is run by writers for writers. A<br />\nwide variety of magazines, the Village<br />\nVoice, and food (the cafe) are reason<br />\nenough to go there. Of course the real<br />\nentertainment value is had in just see-<br />\n<br />\ning the artistic crowd. They go to<br />\nLouie's to eat quiche and browse<br />\nthrough the unsurpassed drama, poetry<br />\nand fiction selections. This is not wimpy \"intro-level\" reading, but serious<br />\nhumanistic fare.<br />\nI also visited several other stores<br />\ndowntown, including the Remington<br />\nBookstore (201 E. Baltimore Street).<br />\nThis store is a bowshot from greatness:<br />\nfine reference and crafts books and a<br />\nremarkable children's section, but no<br />\npsychology, philosophy, sociology, history or poli sci to speak of, really. It's<br />\nworth a peek.<br />\nFrom there, proceed to the Goodwill<br />\nbook nook (317 N. Charles) for one<br />\nreason: a deep, solid section of used<br />\nstudent-type literature(right by the stairs<br />\nas you enter). Or, if you prefer, a cursory glance at the sheet music could<br />\nreveal some bargains.<br />\nOn West Baltimore Street there's<br />\n\"Baltimore's Best Discount Bookstore,\" Vanguard books. \"Horsefeathers,\" I say. I have the distinct impression that this place is where other<br />\nbookstores dump beaten-up or otherwise unbuyable books. No real philosophy or sociology, no psychology<br />\neither (\"self-help\" with a few Freud and<br />\nSkinner selections thrown in for attempted credibility). The literature section is<br />\nthree feet by six feet. They have neat<br />\nkiddie books and some art/photography<br />\nbooks, plus lots of magazines, and they<br />\ngive a discount (between 10 and 25 percent), and they will order books, but I<br />\ndon't know if you'd get the discount<br />\nafter ordering. You might find better<br />\nthings to do with your time than visit<br />\nthis store.<br />\nI then ambled over to B. Dalton's in<br />\nthe Equitable Bank building\u2014after all,<br />\nthey have a New York branch. Without<br />\na doubt this was a big mistake, as flash<br />\nand trash abound. No depth here at all,<br />\nno character; a McDonald's of bookstores. The anthropology/sociology section has a total of about 40 books. A<br />\ntruly contemptible offering in a strangely annoying setting.<br />\nI managed to save one of the best for<br />\nlast: Walden Books at 33 S. Charles. At<br />\nfirst glance this place seems like another<br />\nB. Dalton's, but don't let that stop you.<br />\nIt may not have the character of Second<br />\nStory or the panache of Louie's but it's<br />\nmy favorite Baltimore new-book store.<br />\nA plentiful humor section, reference<br />\nbooks, psychology, philosophy and an<br />\nacceptable fiction and literature section,<br />\nplus economics and poli sci. Also, most<br />\nstriking is the abundance of good art,<br />\nphotography, children, travel and cook<br />\nbooks. Walden also has an intriguing<br />\n\"Compuserve\" section and a full selection of computer books, along with<br />\nenough magazines to last out the week.<br />\nThe staff is very helpful. You won't find<br />\nmany academic books here, but you<br />\ncan't do all your browsing in Barnes &<br />\nNoble. I recommend this store; you'll<br />\nprobably like it.<br />\nI have neglected to mention a few<br />\nstores in this list for various reasons.<br />\nThese stores are: Allen's Bookstore<br />\n(33rd Street)\u2014skip it, a wimpy version<br />\nof Second Story down the street and<br />\naround the corner; the 31st Street<br />\nBookstore\u2014a feminist bookstore in<br />\ngeneral, but still worth a visit; the<br />\nTowson State and UMBC bookstores\u2014<br />\n! admit I've never visited these stores,<br />\nbut I'm told their distinguishing features<br />\nare complete collections of Cliff Notes.<br />\nI enjoy browsing through bookstores.<br />\nVisit one or two of the stores I've mentioned above, buy a book, and avoid<br />\nbecoming one of Stipeck's \"Baltimoreans.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fWeave Come A Long Way, Baby<br />\nBY GILLIAN CLARK<br />\nDoes your social life need improvement? Ray Townsend just may have the<br />\nsolution for you. This mysterious miracle worker, known to most of you who<br />\nwatch late-night television as Mr. Ray,<br />\nhas been turning the Cinderella trick for<br />\n15 years here in Baltimore. Many a soul<br />\ndissatisfied with his or her appearance<br />\n(due to lack of hair) has entered the<br />\nworld of the good-looking and sociable<br />\nwith the help of Mr. Ray's Hair Weave<br />\nCenter.<br />\n\"We're providing a public service,\"<br />\nsays Mr. Ray, his hands folded over his<br />\nstomach. His hair is cut close to his head<br />\nand greased back, with a little gray<br />\nshowing at the temples. Although it<br />\nseems there has been only a sudden<br />\npopularity in Baltimore's only Hair<br />\nWeave business, Mr. Ray reports a<br />\nsteady increase in business. His commercials have been on for 11 years.<br />\n\"Those people on our commercials<br />\nare satisfied customers who volunteered<br />\nto be on TV,\" Mr. Ray smiles broadly.<br />\n\"Not models.\" In fact Mr. Ray produces his own commercials without an<br />\nad agency. \"Yes, they're great commercials. We're shooting a new one next<br />\nweek.\"<br />\nIt started 20 years ago at 3315 Garrison Blvd. as a regular everyday wig<br />\nshop. But as Mr. Ray explains, \"Wigs<br />\nrub your hair out, they thin the hair.<br />\nWeaves, by allowing the scalp to<br />\nbreathe, actually help hair grow.\" So it<br />\n<br />\n\"Mr. Ray\" Townsend<br />\n<br />\nonly made sense that when Ray and his<br />\nbusiness partners were approached by<br />\nthe Harlem, New York, hair weave company, Scotties, they agreed to represent<br />\nthem in the Baltimore area.<br />\n\"We sent girls to school to learn the<br />\nprocedure. Now we're pioneers in the<br />\nBaltimore area. Our method is different<br />\nfrom anywhere else. Its not a corn row.<br />\nActually, the hair is weaved to the<br />\noriginal hair.\"<br />\nMr. Ray described the procedure as<br />\npainless\u2014no needles or breaking of the<br />\nskin. Real hair is actually weaved to<br />\nwhatever hair previously exists on the<br />\nscalp.<br />\n\"It's the best method\u2014better than a<br />\ntoupee.\" Doctors even recommend the<br />\nHair Weave Center to their patients who<br />\nare experiencing hair loss.<br />\n\"Of course it's real hair. The poor<br />\npeople in the Orient donate their hair to<br />\nthe church, and the church sells it. That<br />\nis the only way the church can survive.<br />\nThey grow beautiful hair there.\"<br />\n<br />\nAfter five short years in the wig<br />\nbusiness, Ray crossed over into the<br />\nworld of the hair weave and cashed in.<br />\nThey were to remain just 15 more years<br />\nat the Garrison Blvd. location before<br />\noutgrowing it.<br />\n\"I didn't want to leave Garrison but<br />\nwe got too big for it.\" Now at 2700 West<br />\nCold Spring Lane (with Mr. Ray's expansion in Silver Spring) business is certainly not suffering.<br />\n\"Yes, we're doing well here, the place<br />\nis bigger and we're on four bus lines;<br />\nwe're much easier to get to.\" Mr. Ray<br />\nexplains that the center has been so successful that the price of a complete hair<br />\nweave($240.00) has not changed in 15<br />\nyears. Aside from his commercials, the<br />\nmost popular on local television, Ray attributes the success of the company to<br />\nword-of-mouth advertisements.

The food is served buffetstyle, with everything kept in hot plates<br />\non a long table. When you reach the<br />\ntable, you pick up plates and utensils<br />\n(choosing between conventional flatware and chopsticks).<br />\nFirst, two types of soup are offered:<br />\nsweet and sour and egg drop. The soups<br />\nare basically pretty good, although not<br />\nquite hot enough, which is a problem we<br />\nfound with all the food. Two types of<br />\n.ice are also offered: plain white rice and<br />\nried rice, the latter has pork and<br />\n<br />\nvegetables mixed in and is quite good,<br />\nas are the lo mein noodles.<br />\nNext, three different types of dishes<br />\nare offered, usually including sweet-andsour pork, and some kinds of beef and<br />\nchicken dishes with assorted vegetables<br />\nmixed in. Although the food isn't that<br />\ngreat as far as Chinese food goes, we.<br />\nfound it to be a good bargain for lunch,<br />\nand we left feeling quite satisfied.<br />\nThe best bet is the eggrolls\u2014they're<br />\nvery tasty, but unfortunately few and<br />\nfar between, so you really have to be on<br />\nyour toes when they are brought out,<br />\nsince everyone else seems to like them<br />\ntoo.

It is a force<br />\nthat can haunt or comfort, but one<br />\nwhose effects can never be shaken off.<br />\nIn Theatre Hopkins' presentation,<br />\ncurrently running at the Barn, the<br />\nIreland home of the Tynan family is a<br />\nclutter of dusty furniture, bric-a-brac,<br />\nbottles of Guinness, old books, umbrella skeletons. It is the early 1960s;<br />\nCharles(Daniel Baileys), adopted son of<br />\nan otherwise childless couple and now<br />\na London playwright, has come back to<br />\nbury his father(Donald Hart), a cranky<br />\nbut basically meek and well-meaning<br />\ngardener whose domineering wife(Anne<br />\nHelms-Irons) he has survived by only a<br />\nfew years. Charles' return to the old<br />\nhouse after the funeral unlocks a flood<br />\nof memories and past conflicts; the action on stage duplicates his mental process as he relives his adolescence, the<br />\nrecollections of which are still so vivid<br />\nto him at age 40 that he finds himself<br />\ninteracting with them, offering comment, getting into arguments with the<br />\nghosts of his father, mother and former<br />\nself. As Charles relives these events, we<br />\nsee the warring forces that propel him<br />\ninto manhood.<br />\nMost of the memories center around<br />\nCharles' relationship with his father: a<br />\nman who, as Charles grows into manhood, comes to symbolize much less an<br />\nauthority figure or role model as a<br />\n<br />\npathetic figure who takes the world's<br />\npunishments without complaint or<br />\nstruggle.<br />\nUnder the hand of producing director Laurlene Straughn Pratt and technical directors Alicia Walters and Mark<br />\nWalters, the Tynan living room becomes<br />\na shadow box in which the elements of<br />\npast and present action constantly shift,<br />\noverlap, or oppose each other. Movement from one time frame to another is<br />\nfluid and easy to follow; the small space<br />\nis well utilized, alternately representing,<br />\namong other things, the seaside, the<br />\ncountry estate where Charles' father<br />\ngardens, and the office in which young<br />\nCharlie (Greg Kable) is given his first<br />\njob.<br />\nLeonard avoids the pitfall of presenting these excerpts from Charlie's life<br />\nwith the deliberate intent of exposing his<br />\nfamily life as a sham, or passing moral<br />\njudgment upon the way he was raised.<br />\nInstead, although the memories are<br />\nmediated through the adult Charles'<br />\nconsciousness, we are allowed to form<br />\nour own opinions about them, much as<br />\nCharles must do in his own mind, as a<br />\nway of confronting his past so that he<br />\nmay attempt to put it behind him.<br />\nHelms-Irons is a fearsome presence as<br />\nCharles' mother, coming across particularly well in a tense scene in which<br />\nshe makes young Charlie rewrite a letter to family friends because the first<br />\ndraft contained a literary reference.<br />\nKable provides heartfelt, impish representation of the young Charlie; Ralph<br />\nPiersanti is a strong presence in the supporting role of Drumm, Charles' first<br />\nemployer. Baileys plays the adult<br />\n<br />\nArts<br />\n<br />\nFather and son: Donald Hart and Daniel Baileys wait for Da's boat to come in.<br />\n<br />\nCharles passionately, as a man who can<br />\nremain wistful about his past even as it<br />\ntortures him.<br />\nHart is memorable but slightly<br />\ncaricaturish as Da; his best moments<br />\ncome in a jealous diatribe against his<br />\nwife's constant talk of the better life she<br />\nabandoned to marry him, and in an eerily effective scene in which an older,<br />\nsenile Da relives asking his wife's father<br />\nfor her hand. It is in these scenes that<br />\nwe glimpse something of the true nature<br />\nof Da's life, and the overwhelming hold<br />\nhis personality still retains on Charles'<br />\n<br />\nmemory.<br />\nThe play's only major flaw is that it<br />\n- never completely brings the elements of<br />\npast and present into equilibrium: no<br />\nfirm statements are made about Charles'<br />\nultimate success in dealing with his past;<br />\nno summation is offered of the worth<br />\nof Da's life and its significance for his<br />\nson. Otherwise, Da is a moving portrait<br />\nof an adult trying to make peace with<br />\nthe ghosts of his adolescence, and<br />\nunderstand the people and events that<br />\nshaped him into a man.<br />\n<br />\nSeminal Sax,<br />\n<br />\nCharles Lloyd Back on Top With Montreux '82<br />\nBY ANDY BIENSTOCK<br />\nCharles Lloyd was one of the more influential sax-men of the 1960s. Playing<br />\nwith, among others, Cannonball Adderly and Chico Hamilton, Lloyd was a<br />\nfollower of John Coltrane, soloing in<br />\nthe same frenetic manner. Although<br />\nLloyd was seldom as inspired or profound as Coltrane, he had a unique flair<br />\nfor combining difficult solos with hauntingly beautiful tunes.<br />\nLloyd chose to drop out of sight during the seventies. While in retirement he<br />\nmet his current quartet: French pianist<br />\nMichel Petrucciani; Palle Danielsson,<br />\nanother remarkable Scandinavian bassist; and Son Ship Theus, who has come<br />\na long way since his days with McCoy<br />\nTyner. Lloyd maintains that after<br />\nmeeting these men the urge within him<br />\nto create music \"called\" him out of<br />\nretirement. Such motives often make me<br />\nsuspicious, but when the result is on the<br />\norder of Lloyd's new album Montreux<br />\n'82, which was recorded live at last summer's Jazz Festival in Montreux, Switzerland, who gives a damn what the<br />\nmotives are? The Charles Lloyd Quartet<br />\nwas the sensation of the Montreux<br />\nFestival, and the album, released on the<br />\nElektra-Musician label, documents why.<br />\n<br />\n,.<br />\nIhe urge to create: words of wisdom, Lloyd.<br />\n<br />\nLloyd's playing has lost none of its<br />\nvitality, and the supporting trio lift him<br />\nto new heights. Lloyd's solos are still<br />\nsomewhat dense and convoluted, but<br />\nPetrucciani's airy piano keeps him from<br />\nbogging down. The album's second side<br />\nis a particular joy, opening with Bill<br />\nEvans' lovely composition \"Very Early,\" which progresses from the pretty<br />\nmelodic line into increasingly thick,<br />\nswirling solos. From \"Very Early,\"<br />\nLloyd lights into a short solo piece titled<br />\n\"Michel,\" and bounds from there into<br />\nthe opening, samba-inflected section of<br />\n\"Forest Flower.\" The recording of<br />\n\"Forest Flower (Sunrise and Sunset)\"<br />\nthat Lloyd did with Chico Hamilton and<br />\nGabor Szabo was a seminal '60s performance, and the quartet here is equal to<br />\nthe earlier group. Petrucciani leads the<br />\nway into the final, calypso portion of<br />\nthe tune, and one must wonder at his<br />\nskill\u2014which is amazing, because he suffers from a rare bone disease and is no<br />\nmore than four feet tall.<br />\nCurrent pop bands that claim to play<br />\ndance music should listen to this album,<br />\nand \"Forest Flower\" in particular; for<br />\nnot only is the music danceable, but the<br />\nmusic itself dances. It is a joyous finale<br />\nto a marvelous album.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 13<br />\n<br />\nWhat's Up This Week<br />\nFILM<br />\n<br />\nHour of the Furnaces(part one)<br />\n(Third World Film Series, Mergenthaler 1 1 1): This Argentinian film about political struggles in that country was hailed<br />\nby Pauline Kael as \"highly<br />\nsophisticated and conceived on<br />\nan epic scale.\" Pretty strong Kind Hearts and Coronets<br />\nwords even for Pauline, so you (Reel World, location TBA):<br />\nknow this must have some The English black comedy stars<br />\nThank God<br />\nmerit.

Exploiting the Athletes?<br />\nBY MICHAEL KUDUK<br />\nHerschel Walker is no longer a folk<br />\nhero in Georgia, or anywhere else, for<br />\nthat matter. The man who pulled people out of wrecked cars, and the man<br />\nwhom no football defense ever devised<br />\ncould stop, the same man who wore<br />\nnumber 34 for the Georgia Bulldogs<br />\nand who represented the state of<br />\nGeorgia and the entire South betrayed<br />\nevery one of his friends by turning professional. Walker was more than 4<br />\nfootball player\u2014he was an image of<br />\npride and integrity, a perfect model for<br />\nany young athlete. That image was<br />\nsmashed into millions of pieces\u2014the<br />\ndollar amount of his contract with the<br />\nNew Jersey Generals of the United<br />\nStates Football League.<br />\nMost experts agree that Walker's<br />\nsigning can only help the USFL.<br />\nBefore signing, the new league had a<br />\nfirm beginning\u2014solid ownership, firm<br />\ncommitments and two television contracts. Walker is an added publicity<br />\nboost, guaranteeing higher ticket sales<br />\nthan previously expected, and also<br />\nguaranteeing, through television<br />\nrevenues, that the new league's initial<br />\niea of red ink is only a shallow pond.<br />\nWalker's signing gave the USFL<br />\nrespect. The new league no longer has<br />\nthe reputation as a haven for green<br />\nrookies, over-the-hill veterans, retreads<br />\nand NFL rejects. It has an identity of<br />\nits own that will attract stars from both<br />\nthe college ranks and those of the NFL<br />\nas well. The USFL was a solid<br />\norganization to start with, with firm<br />\n<br />\nowners and plenty of money behind it.<br />\nNow it has something else\u2014glamour,<br />\nspecifically, Herschel Walker's<br />\nglamour. Singlehandedly, he has put the<br />\nnew league in a position to directly<br />\nrival the NFL for the football dollar.<br />\nThis new interleague rivalry could<br />\nvery well kill the USFL. Originally, the<br />\nUSFL intended to present football at<br />\na slightly lower caliber of play than in<br />\nthe NFL, but during the spring and<br />\nsummer instead of the fall. The USFL<br />\nnever really wanted direct competition<br />\nwith the ()icier league, but now, with<br />\nWalker, they get it. The NFL is a formidable foe, with resources in the form<br />\nof television contracts, ownership and<br />\nmassive fan support. It remains to be<br />\nseen what the USFL can lure from the<br />\nNFL.<br />\nThe other problem with Walker's<br />\nsigning was that he was an<br />\nundergraduate when he turned pro.<br />\nMost colleges do not want their football programs undermined by defecting sophomores and juniors, and as<br />\na result are barring the USFL from<br />\ntheir campuses. Without fresh college<br />\nplayers, the USFL is doomed to fail.<br />\nMany questions are left open after<br />\none of the most cataclysmic events in<br />\nfootball history. Will the USFL succeed, or will it fail like many of its<br />\npredecessors? Will the NFL resort to<br />\ndrafting undergraduates? What is the<br />\nfuture of the college draft itself? Who<br />\nwill stop Walker? Nobody in the NFL<br />\ncould have, so who will in the USFL?<br />\nOne thing is for certain\u2014live or die,<br />\nthe USFL has made its permanent<br />\nmark on American sports history.<br />\n<br />\nBY JOHN BEVILACQUA<br />\nThe signing of All-American<br />\nGeorgia running back, Herschel<br />\nWalker, for a reported $3 million per<br />\nyear, has given rise to many interesting<br />\nquestions. Will a bidding war break<br />\nout similar to the old AFL-NFL salary<br />\nbattles? Will Walker bring credibility<br />\nto the USFL just as Joe Namath did<br />\nfor the AFL? What will be the effect<br />\non the NFL salary structure? Will the<br />\nfak be the ones to pick up the tab once<br />\nagain? To me, however, the most interesting aspect of Walker's signing<br />\nwith the New Jersey Generals has been<br />\nthe response of college coaches and<br />\neducators.<br />\nFor the most part, college coaches<br />\nacross the nation were infuriated.<br />\nSome coaches have threatened USFL<br />\nrecruiters in order to protect their<br />\nballplayers and alldw them to get their<br />\neducation.<br />\nWhat the coaches fear most,<br />\nhowever, is not student athletes missing out on a diploma, but the elimination of an NFL (and supposed USFL)<br />\nrule of not signing football players until their class graduates. This<br />\nundergraduate singing rule was successfully challenged in court by college<br />\nbasketball players last year. Walker<br />\nhad threatened to challenge it last year,<br />\nbefore finally deciding to remain at<br />\nGeorgia.<br />\nJust whose interests does this rule<br />\nprotect in the long run? Isn't it in<br />\nWalker's interest to grab the big bucks<br />\n($15.5 million for five years) at the<br />\nheight of his marketability instead of<br />\nreturning to Georgia and risk a possi-<br />\n<br />\nble career-ending injury? If IBM offered a Hopkins undergrad $3 million<br />\nper year, would President Muller ban<br />\nall IBM recruiters from campus to<br />\nmake sure that all students receive their<br />\ndiplomas before advancing to greener<br />\npastures? Certainly not.<br />\nIt is clear that a player receiving his<br />\ndiploma is not the main interest of this<br />\nrule. This is aptly demonstrated by the<br />\nfact that approximately 70 percent of<br />\nthe players in the NFL have not received their college diplomas. If getting<br />\na college diploma was the main goal,<br />\nthis rule would be changed. It would<br />\nbe altered from barring players from<br />\nbeing signed until their college classes<br />\nhave graduated to prohibiting players<br />\nfrom signing until they have graduated<br />\nwith a degree.<br />\nUnder the present circumstances,<br />\nboth the colleges and the pros benefit.<br />\nAs 1(a Berkow, noted columnist for<br />\nThe New York Times, pointed out,<br />\n\"The colleges are happy because the<br />\nfootball player is around for four<br />\nyears. The pros are happy because they<br />\n1) look good as educational benefactors, and 2) don't have to pop for a<br />\nminor-league system, as major-league<br />\nbaseball does.\"<br />\nAs it stands now, unfortunately,<br />\nwhat is at the heart of the coaches'<br />\nviolent response is their fear of losing<br />\ntheir outstanding players and maingate attractions, and not the future of<br />\ntheir scholar-athletes. So let's not<br />\ndiscredit the USFL for making one<br />\nathlete financially sound for life, but<br />\nlet's investigate the higher-powered<br />\nathletic programs throughout the nation that are exploiting the college<br />\nathlete.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nWomen Take Second<br />\n<br />\nMen Swimmers Bring Home 13th Straight Title<br />\nBY KAREL RASKA<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins men's<br />\nand women's swimming teams<br />\nfinished first and second,<br />\nrespectively, at the 13-team<br />\nMAC swimming championships<br />\nat Dickinson College last<br />\nweekend.<br />\nThe women's second-place<br />\nfinish behind Gettysburg was a<br />\nsharp improvement over last<br />\nyear's fourth-place finish.<br />\n\"Realistically, we could not win<br />\nwithout us swimming well and<br />\nsomeone swimming poorly.

Within a week following the Student Council's request for rectification of an unfair situation whereby<br />\nMcCoy Hall freshmen have been charged<br />\nunreasonably high rents, Associate Dean for<br />\nAdministration, Norm Krueger and Director of Auxiliary Enterprises, Bettye Miller<br />\nhammered out a new policy to take effect<br />\nnext year. While not all of the Student Council's demands were met, the recent solution<br />\nis not only practical but fair.<br />\nThe issue arose with the Student Council<br />\nHousing Committee's discovery that 30<br />\nfreshmen living in McCoy Hall pay $145<br />\nmore in rent than those undergraduates in<br />\nthe dormitories. Their residence in offcampus housing is not by choice, but rather,<br />\nis the result of a freshman population in excess of available dormitory space. The administration originally defended the policy<br />\nbY pointing out that all incoming freshmen<br />\nreceived notification of the possibility that<br />\nthey would be placed in higher-priced, offcampus dwellings in the event of an<br />\noverflow. All freshmen did indeed sign contracts consenting to this procedure.<br />\nHowever, as SC Housing Committee Chairman Mike Kun commented, \"Just because<br />\nit's in a contract doesn't mean it's fair.\" In<br />\nthe first place, students must sign the contract if they wish to attend Hopkins. Secondly, it is clear that the undergraduates in<br />\nMcCoy are not satisfied with their situation.<br />\nThe administration originally believed that<br />\nthe extra rent charge was justified on the<br />\ngrounds that the McCoy apartments contain<br />\ncooking facilities. Yet only three of the 30<br /><br />\nStudents Should Oppose Aid And Draft Plan<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing to you to discuss<br />\nthe Solomon Amendment to<br />\nthe Military Selective Service<br />\nAct. The Solomon Amendment<br />\nis intended to deny federally<br />\nsupported financial aid to those<br />\nstudents who have not registered for the draft. This<br />\nrepresents a serious threat to<br />\nour institutions of higher<br />\neducation and to many of the<br />\npeople within them.<br />\nPlease understand that registration itself is not the central<br />\nissue here. I do not intend to<br />\ndebate that, because this bill<br />\nfalters on its own demerits. It<br />\ndiscriminates on the basis of<br />\nage, sex and economic position.<br />\nIt violates the Constitution by<br />\nlegislating both a pronounce-.<br />\nment of guilt and the corresponding punishment without<br />\ngranting a court trial. It also<br />\nviolates the Fifth Amendment<br />\nby requiring students to indicate whether or not they have<br />\nregistered. These are dangerous<br />\nflaws that we must not allow to<br />\ncontinue. For these reasons and<br />\nothers, the Solomon Amendment is being challenged in the<br />\ncourts in Minnesota.

For most of these<br />\nstudents, then, the kitchens are of little use;<br />\nthe $145 worth of benefits are being wasted.<br />\nLast week the Student Council demanded that the administration change this unfair policy as well as refund 145 dollars to<br />\nall freshmen living in McCoy. Theoretically, this refund would be a welcome gesture.<br />\nPractically however, if the refund were offered to this year's McCoy Hall freshmen,<br />\nthose undergraduates who unwillingly lived<br />\nin McCoy in previous years would also have<br />\nthe right to the same reimbursement. Financial constraints render such a response impossible. However, the Student Council's<br />\ncall for a policy revision for next year<br />\ngenerated surprisingly speedy action.

While it<br />\nis true that the powers of the council are<br />\nlimited, it is essential that the best people be<br />\nput in office in order to maximize effectiveness. The office of the presidency demands<br />\nthe most consideration. It is the president<br />\nthat sets the agenda and determines the direction that the council will pursue. This year<br />\nthree students are vying for the top position.<br />\nAll three offer contrasting viewpoints and<br />\nperspectives.<br />\nThe candidate that appears least capable<br />\nof serving student interests is Eric Fink, who<br />\nis running on a platform endorsing student<br />\napathy. While Fink often speaks of laudable<br />\ngoals, his party, GASP!, offers so many inconsistent statements that it is unclear what<br />\nFink intends to do if elected.<br />\nMaureen Freed bases her platform on the<br />\nneed to reform the administration and<br />\nmechanisms of student government at Hopkins. She is interested in revising the Student<br />\nCouncil committee structure in order to give<br />\nmore attention to issues such as financial aid.<br />\nShe also intends to mend animosities be-<br /><br />\ndecision, however. There are<br />\nschools across the country that<br />\nare instituting those policies<br />\nalready. The students who are<br />\ndenied aid may lose that opportunity forever. These young<br />\nmen are our friends and classmates and their punishment will<br />\nbe a loss not only for them but<br />\nfor the whole University. It is<br />\nfor this reason that the Hopkins<br />\nStudent Council needs to take<br />\na stand against this law. The<br />\nsilence they have chosen to<br />\nmaintain is counter to the interests of the students they are<br />\nsupposed to represent. Petitions<br />\nare being circulated on campus<br />\nurging the Student Council to<br />\nactively oppose the Solomon<br />\nAmendment. You can take part<br />\nby signing or by circulating one<br />\nyourself. Just ask for one when<br />\nsomeone approaches you to<br />\nsign.

Please join us in<br />\nwhatever way you can in our<br />\ndrive to prevent this bad law<br />\nfrom damaging our friends and<br />\nour schools.<br /><br />\nHowever, Freed's primary objective is to<br />\nestablish better communication between the<br />\nStudent Council and the undergraduate<br />\nbody. She hopes to establish procedures by<br />\nwhich all student complaints are formally<br />\nconsidered by council. Undergraduates who<br />\nare concerned about a communication gap<br />\nbetween students and student government<br />\nshould cast their vote for Freed.<br />\nThe News-Letter, however, believes that<br />\nthe candidate best suited to serve student<br />\nneeds is the incumbent, Doug Fellman. Unlike Freed, who views the president's role as<br />\na mediator in resolving student problems,<br />\nFellman is more concerned with representing<br />\nstudent concerns in the broader framework<br />\nof the University. Fellman's primary objective is to generate greater concern for<br />\nundergraduate education among the faculty and administration.

Circulation KM.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 5<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nFRED FACTORIAL!<br /><br />\nPoor Preparation<br />\nFor JHU Pre-Laws<br />\nBY MAUREEN FREED<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University circular states that<br />\n\"Hopkins is best suited for the<br />\nserious student who has a clear<br />\nidea of his or her academic<br />\nand/or professional objectives.\" Most would agree that<br />\nthis is true. The circular continues, however, to state that<br />\n\"most Hopkins studens fit into this category.\" This is contrary to fact.<br />\nThe survey administered last<br />\nweek by the Pre-Law Society<br />\nreveals that while 85 percent of<br />\nHopkins pre-meds did choose<br />\nmedicine in high school or<br />\nearlier, only 28 percent of the<br />\nrest of the student body entered<br />\nHopkins with solidly defined<br />\nlong-term goals. The remaining<br />\n72 percent either have made or<br />\nwill make that decision while at<br />\nHopkins. This underscores the<br />\nnecessity of providing a comprehensive support system for<br />\ncareer development.<br />\nCurrently, the network of<br />\nservices available to pre-meds is<br />\nfairly comprehensive. It is also<br />\nvery well publicized\u2014incoming<br />\nfreshman pre-meds are deluged<br />\nwith information. Questions<br />\nare answered before they even<br />\narise.<br />\nThe situation is very different<br />\nfor other pre-professionals.<br />\nTheir support services are seriously deficient in several areas.<br />\nThe most glaring omission in<br />\nthe present system is the lack of<br />\nadvising and information for<br />\nundergrads interested in pursuing graduate study. Although<br />\nmany departments have accumulated information on graduate programs at other universities, these are in general not<br />\norganized and students are not<br />\ninformed of their availability.<br />\nPeople interested in legal<br />\ncareers are somewhat better<br />\noff. They at least have their<br />\nown adviser, and they do have<br />\nresources of printed information to draw upon.<br />\nHowever, last week's survey<br />\nrevealed a serious underutilization of existing pre-law<br />\nresources at Hopkins, resources<br />\nwhich would seem to hold a<br />\ngreat deal of potential for<br />\nfacilitating 'career decisions.<br />\nAdvising staff should work to<br />\nexpand knowledge of and access to these resources.<br />\nConsider law-related internships, for example. These internships are a potentially invaluable source of information\u2014a useful counterpart to<br />\nacademic perspective. Says one<br />\nlegal handbook, \"When it<br />\ncomes to finding out about the<br />\nday-to-day work of a lawyer,<br />\nthere isn't a next best thing to<br />\nbeing there.\" Yet the preprofessional survey reveals that<br />\nlaw-related internships are held<br />\nalmost exclusively by members<br />\nof a \"hard-core\" group who<br />\nhad made their decisions to<br />\npursue legal careers before<br />\nentering Hopkins. This indicates that:<br /><br />\n(1) Internships are currently<br />\nviewed primarily as a component of law school admissions<br />\nstrategy\u2014not as a source of information on which to base the<br />\ncareer decision.<br />\n(2)Internships are held largely by those committed pre-laws<br />\nlikely to be aggressive in<br />\nlocating and securing them.<br />\nWhat can be done to expand<br />\nthe role of these internships?<br />\nFirst, internships should be<br />\nmade available more easily and<br />\non more congenial terms. Internships should be available<br />\nwhich do not necessitate a commitment of Intersession time, as<br />\ndoes the Curriculum for Political Leadership program, and<br />\nwhich do not require supplemental coursework and papers,<br />\nas does the Mayor's Fellowship. Secondly, information<br />\nabout them\u2014including complete descriptions of programs,<br />\nagencies, faculty coordinators,<br />\ntime requirements and credits<br />\nawarded\u2014should be distributed<br />\nto all incoming freshmen.<br />\nThe two-thirds of the<br />\nundergraduate student body<br />\nwhose interests lie outside<br />\nmedicine are particularly likely<br />\nto be in need of a fundamental<br />\nresource base, both for career<br />\nexploration and the professional school application process.

PASSANO<br />\nBefore discussing the social<br />\nactivities of the 1920s, it<br />\nmight be well to first describe<br />\nthe campus itself since drastic<br />\nchanges have taken place in<br />\nthe past 60 years. In the early<br />\n1920s, there were only six<br />\nbuildings on campus: Gilman<br />\nHall, the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding, the Mechanical<br />\nEngineering Building, the<br />\nPowerhouse, the Carroll<br />\nMansion and the Barn. There<br />\nwere no dormitories, no student activities building and<br />\nthe library was on the first<br />\nfloor of Gilman Hall.<br />\nThere were approximately<br />\n700 all male students on the<br />\ncampus, of which two-thirds<br />\nlived in Baltimore and its<br />\nsuburbs. They had attended<br />\nprep school in Baltimore and<br />\ntherefore, to them, going to<br />\ncollege was simply an extension of the life which they had<br />\nbeen used to living. They<br />\ncame to the University in the<br />\nmorning by way of the<br />\nCharles Street bus or the St.<br />\nPaul Street streetcar and in<br />\nthe afternoon returned home<br />\nby the same means. Few students owned automobiles,<br />\nbut those who did found ample parking close to their<br />\nclasses.<br />\nSixteen fraternities (nine<br />\nnational and seven local)<br /><br />\nowned houses within walking<br />\ndistance of the campus, and<br />\n40 percent of the student<br />\nbody belonged to a fraternity. Fraternity houses supplied<br />\nroom and board to perhaps<br />\n100 students, and the nonfraternity men who came<br />\nfrom parts of Maryland too<br />\nfar from Baltimore for<br />\ncommuting, and the few from<br />\nout-of-state, found lodging<br />\nnear the Homewood campus.<br />\nIt would not be accurate,<br />\nhowever, to suggest that the<br />\nsocial life of Baltimore was<br />\nfor all intents and purpose the<br />\nsocial life of the Johns Hopkins' students in the early<br />\n1920s, since the campus did<br />\nmost definitely have a life of<br />\nits own. The Barn was the<br />\ncenter of student activity.<br />\nMany ate their lunch at the<br />\nBarn, although most who<br />\nwere members of a fraternity<br />\nate lunch at their fraternity<br />\nhouse.<br />\nOf course the student body<br />\nturned out in force to cheer<br />\nthe home team when it played<br />\n(football in the fall, lacrosse<br />\nin the spring) at Homewood<br />\nField. Attendance was compulsory for freshman, who<br />\nwere not allowed to bring a<br />\ndate.<br />\nUpperclassmen,<br />\nhowever, could and did bring<br />\ntheir dates and took them to<br />\nthe Tea Dance held in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Building<br /><br />\nwhich always followed the<br />\ngame. In the spring, the girls<br />\nwore their new Easter finery<br />\nand a veritable fashion show<br />\nwould take place as they<br />\nwalked to their seats in the<br />\nstands. When a swimming<br />\nmeet was held at the pool of<br />\nthe Baltimore Athletic Club,<br />\na Tea Dance was also held<br />\nafter the meet.<br />\nDancing was very popular<br />\nin the '20s. The Waltz, the<br />\nFox Trot and the Two Step<br />\nwere the dances and cheek-tocheek dancing was the style.<br />\nThe Cotillion Club arranged<br />\nthe dances. The Tea Dances<br />\nwere informal with the music<br />\nsupplied by a student orchestra called the Blue Jays.<br />\nThe evening dances, including<br />\nthe Junior Prom and the<br />\nSenior Prom, were quite formal, dance cards were filled<br />\nout, the girls wore long<br />\ndresses and the men dressed<br />\nblack tie. The dances were<br />\nusually held at the Maryland<br />\nCasualty Auditorium (torn<br />\ndown) and a full orchestra<br />\nwas engaged. In addition to<br />\nthe dances arranged by the<br />\nCotillion Club, the leading<br />\nfraternities held an annual<br />\ndance and competed with<br />\neach other for the most<br />\npopular debutantes and<br />\nsubdebs.<br />\nA count of social activities<br />\non the campus would not be<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\ncomplete withodt listing the<br />\nseveral organizations of<br />\nspecial interest, all of which<br />\nhad substantial membership<br />\nand which developed programs furthering the aims<br />\nand purposes of their<br />\nmembership. These include<br />\nthe student chapters of the<br />\nAmerican Society of Civil<br />\nEngineers, the American<br />\nSociety of Mechanial<br />\nEngineers, the Electrical<br />\nClub, the Zionist Society, the<br />\nChristian Service Club and<br />\nthe Tudor and Stuart Club (a<br />\nliterary society).<br />\nIn this account it is interesting to note the dress code<br />\nwhich was followed in the<br />\n1920s.

According to<br />\nthe Registrar, there are normally 100 to 120 post-docs at<br />\nHomewood, although the offices of deans Suskind and<br />\nBrush say there are only 76 in<br />\nthe School of Arts and Sciences<br />\nand six in Engineering at the<br />\npresent time. So where are these<br />\nunseen individuals?<br />\nDr. Tim Duelfer, who completed his post-doctoral work in<br />\nthe Division of Radiation<br />\nHealth at the School of Hygiene, says, \"They are in their<br />\nlabs. They put in long hours<br />\nand are expected to get a lot<br />\ndone.\" Post-docs tend to work<br />\nhard, either because they<br />\nworried about their careers or<br />\nthey work for an active professor who demands that a lot<br />\nof time be spent in the lab.<br />\nPost-doc work is similar to<br />\ngraduate school in the amount<br />\nof work done and in the pay.<br />\nPost-doctoral positions are<br />\nusually obtained with a friend<br />\nof a graduate student's thesis<br />\nadviser or by writing to some-<br /><br />\none the student is interested in.<br />\nMany openings for post-doctoral positions are advertised in<br />\nprofessional magazines such as<br />\nChemical Engineering News<br />\nand Science, etc. According to<br />\nDuelfer, \"Post-doc work is<br />\nusually done in the same field<br />\na person has been in or closely<br />\nrelated to it, the farther away [a'<br />\npost-doctoral position Is from<br />\na person's Ph.D. field] the<br />\ntougher it is to get into.\"<br />\nAlthough some post-doctoral<br />\nfellowships are offered for two<br />\nyears, most are initially for one<br />\nyear with the possible extension<br />\nto a second year, contingent<br />\nupon the mutual satisfaction of<br />\nthe post-doc and his supervisor.<br />\nPost-doctoral positions are<br />\npredominantly at research universities and government laboratories, but some are available<br />\nin industry. The industrial positions usually involve being<br />\nhired at the Ph.D. level for low<br />\npay with no guarantee of<br />\nrenewal. They are even less<br />\ndesirable because they result in<br />\nfewer publications. The major<br />\ncomplaint among post-does is<br />\nthe poor pay.

Post-docs usually<br />\nwork on part of a new project<br />\nwhich has been funded or on an<br />\nexisting project. Grant proposals often include requests<br /><br />\nfor post-doe's salaries. But<br />\nthere is also a lot of leeway for<br />\na post-doe to investigate other<br />\nareas in which he might be<br />\ninterested.<br />\nFrom the view of the postdoe, the work is almost like an<br />\n\"apprenticeship,\" according to<br />\nDuelfer. \"[The idea is to] go to<br />\nwork for someone who is fairly famous, and by working<br />\nhard establish a name for<br />\nyourself.\" Duelfer also says a<br />\npost-doe's position \"is what<br />\nyou make out of it\"; it can be<br />\na rewarding experience or it can<br />\nbe just another job. Dr. John<br />\nLever, who enjoys his post-doc<br />\nwork for Dr. Gary Posner, believes, \"It's a great opportunity, you're able to do research<br />\nfor research's sake and can<br />\nwork on many different projects; there's no press to concentrate on one subject like a<br />\nthesis.\"<br />\nUndergraduates have little<br />\ncontact with post-doctoral researchers with the exception of<br />\nthose whose undergraduate research is in a lab with a postdoe.

Starting up<br />\nnorth, the first store I came to was<br />\nTowson Books (by Hutzler's, on York<br />\nRoad). Towson has schlock y studenttype books: some anthropology, some<br />\npsychology, lots of Cliff Notes, etc.<br />\nThere is a large sci-fi collection (larger<br />\nthan the aforementioned sections combined) and lots of romances, mysteries<br />\nand general fiction. There is also a surprisingly extensive literature section, in<br />\nfact one of the best in town. There is a<br />\ndiscount on hard-cover books.<br />\nMoving west I came to Upstairs<br />\nBooks (in Mt. Washington, on Sulgrave<br />\nAvenue). \"Sale,\" the sign said, and all<br />\nused books\u2014how could I stop myself<br />\nfrom giving 'it a look? After a quick<br />\nglance, I realized that I'd rather have<br />\nbeen in a checkout line at Giant. This<br />\nplace was a second-rate Second Story<br /><br />\n_\u2022<br />\n\"1\"\"\"\"\"7,\"9\"\"IlkIrrr\"\"\"us<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nr \"OW<br /><br />\nWhere's Beck',?<br /><br />\n(uptown): lots of garbage(romances and<br />\ngeneral dopey fiction) and no psychology, sociology or philosophy books to<br />\nspeak of(I have a larger selection in my<br />\napartment). The \"sale\" was, in fact, a<br />\nscheme to clear out their oversupply of<br />\nromances and fiction. There was a perfunctory section of sci-fi and some<br />\nreference books, and even a history section which was close to passing muster.<br />\nI can see no reason for going to this<br />\nbookstore except maybe to sober up<br />\ncoming from the Mt. Washington<br />\nTavern.<br />\nNext stop: the Rotunda, and a real<br />\njewel of a shop. Gordon's looks like it'll<br />\nbe stocked with flash and trash, but by<br />\nall means look again. An interesting fiction section, cookbooks, crafts, kiddie<br />\nbooks, plus the only copy of The Panda's Thumb I've seen in Baltimore.<br /><br />\nAn alternathe to Barnes &amp; Noble, and much closer to Subways.<br /><br />\nThere is surprisingly good selection<br />\nthroughout the store (not much depth,<br />\nbut new books) and the staff is friendly. They will order books, and they take<br />\nchecks. Go there instead of Horn &amp;<br />\nHorn; the selection is bigger and better<br />\nfor you at Gordon's. Note that the same<br />\ngoes for the Gordon's at Harbor Place,<br />\nbut to a lesser degree.<br />\nNo bookstore itinerary in town is<br />\ncomplete without Barnes &amp; Noble. Boo,<br />\nhiss, I can hear you now. Let's face it,<br />\nthough; it's convenient, it sells a wide<br />\nrange of books, and it's a Barnes &amp; Noble (for those of you who don't know,<br />\nBarnes &amp; Noble is a huge chain of bookstores operating out of New York). In<br />\nfact, I was surprised to learn that our<br />\nown Barnes &amp; Noble is the second<br />\nlargest collegiate Barnes &amp; Noble in the<br />\ncountry (right behind Columbia's). And<br />\nit is frankly an awesome bookstore, a<br />\nplace I would feel compelled to return<br />\nto even if it wasn't on campus. It beats<br />\nhell out of Follett's; they let you read<br />\nall the magazines without buying them,<br />\nand will order books for you. This is<br />\nbeyond a doubt the best academic<br />\nbookstore in Baltimore (though they<br />\nlack a hearty used-book section) so enjoy it. If you have questions while<br />\nyou're there, ask for Becky.<br />\nFor a brief stop, consider the 31st<br />\nStreet Card and Book Shop (on St.<br />\nPaul). Don't be fooled by the \"used<br />\nbooks\" sign, because you probably<br />\nwouldn't want these books for free, let<br />\nalone half-price. Look for neat fiction,<br />\nliterature, sci-fi and hobby books, some<br />\nof which you can find in earlier (read:<br />\ncheaper) editions than elsewhere.<br />\nAlthough Second Story downtown is<br />\nclosed, Stipeck must still believe in us<br />\nnorthern Baltimoreans. Second Story<br />\nBooks (33rd &amp; Greenmount) is always<br />\na treat. Selling almost all used books, it<br />\nprovides a selection of drama, art<br />\nbooks, philosophy, psychology, sociology and history/political science unequaled anywhere else in the city at any<br />\nprice. Since Second Story buys collections, the stock always varies but<br />\nmanages to sustain its good selection<br />\nnonetheless. I've spent much time and<br />\nmoney in this store and will continue to<br />\ndo so if possible(some books I've found<br />\nthere include Boring's History of Experimental Psychology, Cushman's A<br />\nBeginner's History of Philosophy, and<br />\nGerth and Mills' classic From Max<br />\nWeber). I suggest that you look for<br />\ncourse books here before Barnes &amp; Noble, and keep coming back to browse.<br />\nAt 518 N. Charles, Louie's is the store<br />\nwhich drove Second Story out of business downtown, and no wonder. This<br />\nplace is run by writers for writers. A<br />\nwide variety of magazines, the Village<br />\nVoice, and food (the cafe) are reason<br />\nenough to go there. Of course the real<br />\nentertainment value is had in just see-<br /><br />\ning the artistic crowd. They go to<br />\nLouie's to eat quiche and browse<br />\nthrough the unsurpassed drama, poetry<br />\nand fiction selections. This is not wimpy \"intro-level\" reading, but serious<br />\nhumanistic fare.<br />\nI also visited several other stores<br />\ndowntown, including the Remington<br />\nBookstore (201 E. Baltimore Street).<br />\nThis store is a bowshot from greatness:<br />\nfine reference and crafts books and a<br />\nremarkable children's section, but no<br />\npsychology, philosophy, sociology, history or poli sci to speak of, really. It's<br />\nworth a peek.<br />\nFrom there, proceed to the Goodwill<br />\nbook nook (317 N. Charles) for one<br />\nreason: a deep, solid section of used<br />\nstudent-type literature(right by the stairs<br />\nas you enter). Or, if you prefer, a cursory glance at the sheet music could<br />\nreveal some bargains.<br />\nOn West Baltimore Street there's<br />\n\"Baltimore's Best Discount Bookstore,\" Vanguard books. \"Horsefeathers,\" I say. I have the distinct impression that this place is where other<br />\nbookstores dump beaten-up or otherwise unbuyable books. No real philosophy or sociology, no psychology<br />\neither (\"self-help\" with a few Freud and<br />\nSkinner selections thrown in for attempted credibility). The literature section is<br />\nthree feet by six feet. They have neat<br />\nkiddie books and some art/photography<br />\nbooks, plus lots of magazines, and they<br />\ngive a discount (between 10 and 25 percent), and they will order books, but I<br />\ndon't know if you'd get the discount<br />\nafter ordering. You might find better<br />\nthings to do with your time than visit<br />\nthis store.<br />\nI then ambled over to B. Dalton's in<br />\nthe Equitable Bank building\u2014after all,<br />\nthey have a New York branch. Without<br />\na doubt this was a big mistake, as flash<br />\nand trash abound. No depth here at all,<br />\nno character; a McDonald's of bookstores. The anthropology/sociology section has a total of about 40 books. A<br />\ntruly contemptible offering in a strangely annoying setting.<br />\nI managed to save one of the best for<br />\nlast: Walden Books at 33 S. Charles. At<br />\nfirst glance this place seems like another<br />\nB. Dalton's, but don't let that stop you.<br />\nIt may not have the character of Second<br />\nStory or the panache of Louie's but it's<br />\nmy favorite Baltimore new-book store.<br />\nA plentiful humor section, reference<br />\nbooks, psychology, philosophy and an<br />\nacceptable fiction and literature section,<br />\nplus economics and poli sci. Also, most<br />\nstriking is the abundance of good art,<br />\nphotography, children, travel and cook<br />\nbooks. Walden also has an intriguing<br />\n\"Compuserve\" section and a full selection of computer books, along with<br />\nenough magazines to last out the week.<br />\nThe staff is very helpful. You won't find<br />\nmany academic books here, but you<br />\ncan't do all your browsing in Barnes &amp;<br />\nNoble. I recommend this store; you'll<br />\nprobably like it.<br />\nI have neglected to mention a few<br />\nstores in this list for various reasons.<br />\nThese stores are: Allen's Bookstore<br />\n(33rd Street)\u2014skip it, a wimpy version<br />\nof Second Story down the street and<br />\naround the corner; the 31st Street<br />\nBookstore\u2014a feminist bookstore in<br />\ngeneral, but still worth a visit; the<br />\nTowson State and UMBC bookstores\u2014<br />\n! admit I've never visited these stores,<br />\nbut I'm told their distinguishing features<br />\nare complete collections of Cliff Notes.<br />\nI enjoy browsing through bookstores.<br />\nVisit one or two of the stores I've mentioned above, buy a book, and avoid<br />\nbecoming one of Stipeck's \"Baltimoreans.\"<br /><br />\nWeave Come A Long Way, Baby<br />\nBY GILLIAN CLARK<br />\nDoes your social life need improvement? Ray Townsend just may have the<br />\nsolution for you. This mysterious miracle worker, known to most of you who<br />\nwatch late-night television as Mr. Ray,<br />\nhas been turning the Cinderella trick for<br />\n15 years here in Baltimore. Many a soul<br />\ndissatisfied with his or her appearance<br />\n(due to lack of hair) has entered the<br />\nworld of the good-looking and sociable<br />\nwith the help of Mr. Ray's Hair Weave<br />\nCenter.<br />\n\"We're providing a public service,\"<br />\nsays Mr. Ray, his hands folded over his<br />\nstomach. His hair is cut close to his head<br />\nand greased back, with a little gray<br />\nshowing at the temples. Although it<br />\nseems there has been only a sudden<br />\npopularity in Baltimore's only Hair<br />\nWeave business, Mr. Ray reports a<br />\nsteady increase in business. His commercials have been on for 11 years.<br />\n\"Those people on our commercials<br />\nare satisfied customers who volunteered<br />\nto be on TV,\" Mr. Ray smiles broadly.<br />\n\"Not models.\" In fact Mr. Ray produces his own commercials without an<br />\nad agency. \"Yes, they're great commercials. We're shooting a new one next<br />\nweek.\"<br />\nIt started 20 years ago at 3315 Garrison Blvd. as a regular everyday wig<br />\nshop. But as Mr. Ray explains, \"Wigs<br />\nrub your hair out, they thin the hair.<br />\nWeaves, by allowing the scalp to<br />\nbreathe, actually help hair grow.\" So it<br /><br />\n\"Mr. Ray\" Townsend<br /><br />\nonly made sense that when Ray and his<br />\nbusiness partners were approached by<br />\nthe Harlem, New York, hair weave company, Scotties, they agreed to represent<br />\nthem in the Baltimore area.<br />\n\"We sent girls to school to learn the<br />\nprocedure. Now we're pioneers in the<br />\nBaltimore area. Our method is different<br />\nfrom anywhere else. Its not a corn row.<br />\nActually, the hair is weaved to the<br />\noriginal hair.\"<br />\nMr. Ray described the procedure as<br />\npainless\u2014no needles or breaking of the<br />\nskin. Real hair is actually weaved to<br />\nwhatever hair previously exists on the<br />\nscalp.<br />\n\"It's the best method\u2014better than a<br />\ntoupee.\" Doctors even recommend the<br />\nHair Weave Center to their patients who<br />\nare experiencing hair loss.<br />\n\"Of course it's real hair. The poor<br />\npeople in the Orient donate their hair to<br />\nthe church, and the church sells it. That<br />\nis the only way the church can survive.<br />\nThey grow beautiful hair there.\"<br /><br />\nAfter five short years in the wig<br />\nbusiness, Ray crossed over into the<br />\nworld of the hair weave and cashed in.<br />\nThey were to remain just 15 more years<br />\nat the Garrison Blvd. location before<br />\noutgrowing it.<br />\n\"I didn't want to leave Garrison but<br />\nwe got too big for it.\" Now at 2700 West<br />\nCold Spring Lane (with Mr. Ray's expansion in Silver Spring) business is certainly not suffering.<br />\n\"Yes, we're doing well here, the place<br />\nis bigger and we're on four bus lines;<br />\nwe're much easier to get to.\" Mr. Ray<br />\nexplains that the center has been so successful that the price of a complete hair<br />\nweave($240.00) has not changed in 15<br />\nyears. Aside from his commercials, the<br />\nmost popular on local television, Ray attributes the success of the company to<br />\nword-of-mouth advertisements. While<br />\nwe talked, Leona Sims called to make<br /><br />\n_Restaurant Review<br /><br />\nGo For The Grolls<br />\nOr:MAO GAROGN<br />\nRESTAURANT<br />\nCARRY OUT<br /><br />\nBY KRISTIN CONRAD!<br />\nAND SUSIE PARKER<br /><br />\nan appointment. Her friend, Peggy Abdul had recommended the sure end to<br />\nher baldness. The phone rang again. Mr.<br />\nRay:<br />\n\"Why certainly, that's all we do is<br />\nweave hair. ..Sure, they make chest<br />\npieces for that sort of thing though<br />\nsir. . . Well, they glue it on. But that<br />\nthing isn't permanent. It'll come off in<br />\nthe shower; do think about it before you<br />\ninvest your money in it. .. No, all we do<br />\nis hair weaves for the top of the head,<br />\nfor the top of the head only. Anytime<br />\nsir, thanks for calling.\"<br />\nThere's no doubt Mr. Ray weaves<br />\nwonders restoring and even creating<br />\nbeauty. The hair weave is permanent<br />\nwith just an occasional modification to<br />\nfit the growing hair.<br />\n\"The hair is real hair so it can be styled and permed.

You<br />\ncan get a weave for as little as $24.95.\"<br />\nIt also helps to have no competition.<br />\nMr. Ray holds a monopoly on hair<br />\nweaving in Baltimore.<br />\n\"We started in '68 with just four<br />\nemployees, now we have 14 girls.. .<br />\nWe're planning to open a shop in<br />\nVirginia soon. One of our girls who<br />\nstarted as a weaver is going to manage<br />\nit.\" Mr. Ray smiled, and explained that<br />\nit has been a steady climb to the top, but<br />\nthere is still further to rise. After the<br /><br />\nAlthough we had always noticed the<br />\nHunan Gardens Restaurant and Carryout (which specializes in Szechuan and<br />\nHunan cuisines), we never had the incentive to try it until last semester, when<br />\nwe noticed a new sign: \"All You Can<br />\nEat Luncheon Buffet\u2014$2.95 per Person.\" Since Chinese food is one of our<br />\nfavorites, we realized that this was the<br />\nperfect opportunity for a pig-out session, and decided to go there for lunch.<br />\nThere's usually a line if you go at the<br />\nheight of the lunch hour, but the wait<br />\nis minimal. The food is served buffetstyle, with everything kept in hot plates<br />\non a long table. When you reach the<br />\ntable, you pick up plates and utensils<br />\n(choosing between conventional flatware and chopsticks).<br />\nFirst, two types of soup are offered:<br />\nsweet and sour and egg drop. The soups<br />\nare basically pretty good, although not<br />\nquite hot enough, which is a problem we<br />\nfound with all the food. Two types of<br />\n.ice are also offered: plain white rice and<br />\nried rice, the latter has pork and<br /><br />\nvegetables mixed in and is quite good,<br />\nas are the lo mein noodles.<br />\nNext, three different types of dishes<br />\nare offered, usually including sweet-andsour pork, and some kinds of beef and<br />\nchicken dishes with assorted vegetables<br />\nmixed in. Although the food isn't that<br />\ngreat as far as Chinese food goes, we.<br />\nfound it to be a good bargain for lunch,<br />\nand we left feeling quite satisfied.<br />\nThe best bet is the eggrolls\u2014they're<br />\nvery tasty, but unfortunately few and<br />\nfar between, so you really have to be on<br />\nyour toes when they are brought out,<br />\nsince everyone else seems to like them<br />\ntoo. Incidentally, when we were there<br />\nlast week, fried chicken had been<br />\nsubstituted for the eggrolls, and it was<br />\nbad. It was extremely tough and<br />\ntasteless.<br />\nThe restaurant also has a carry-out<br />\ncounter, which shares the same basic<br />\nmenu with the restaurant. Hunan Gardens is located at 3111 St. Paul Street.<br />\nThe lunch buffet is offered MondaySaturday 11:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Other<br />\nhours are Monday-Saturday 11:30<br />\na.m.-11:00 p.m., and Sunday, 4:00<br />\np.m.-10:00 p.m. Phone: 889-0003.<br /><br />\neatures<br />\nVirginia Weave Center is opened,the<br />\nfranchise, like Oriental hair, can do<br />\nnothing but grow. Mr. Ray agrees that<br />\nhair has been good to him, but he is not<br />\nat all mercenary about it.<br />\n\"Money doesn't enter the picture.<br />\nPeople leave here happy and satisfied.<br />\nI find it gratifying to see people happy.\"<br />\nAnd of course this is the major cause of<br />\nthe success of the Hair Weave Center.<br />\nMr. Ray claims to satisfy 99 percent of<br />\nhis customers\u2014a \"near perfect<br /><br />\nWhat are these people looking at?<br /><br />\naverage.\"<br />\n\"We had a lady in here that was so<br />\nhappy about her new hair she cried\u2014<br />\nshe gave the girl a $50 tip. Now it<br />\ndoesn't matter if you're rich or poor,<br />\n$50 is a lot of money.\" The conclusion<br />\ndrawn: Mr. Ray runs a solid business<br />\nwith a product that is marketable\u2014<br />\nbeauty for sale in Baltimore. As Mr.<br />\nRay himself so eloquently put it: \"Hair<br />\nmakes the difference.\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 12/MARCH 4, 1983<br /><br />\nTheatre Hopkins Gets Its Eire Up<br /><br />\nHugh Leonard's Da: The Power of the Past<br />\nBY DAN VITALE<br />\nThe subject of Hugh Leonard's Da is<br />\nthe way in which the experience of living with our parents binds our consciousnesses no matter how far our adult<br />\nlives take us away from the circumstances of our early years. It is a force<br />\nthat can haunt or comfort, but one<br />\nwhose effects can never be shaken off.<br />\nIn Theatre Hopkins' presentation,<br />\ncurrently running at the Barn, the<br />\nIreland home of the Tynan family is a<br />\nclutter of dusty furniture, bric-a-brac,<br />\nbottles of Guinness, old books, umbrella skeletons. It is the early 1960s;<br />\nCharles(Daniel Baileys), adopted son of<br />\nan otherwise childless couple and now<br />\na London playwright, has come back to<br />\nbury his father(Donald Hart), a cranky<br />\nbut basically meek and well-meaning<br />\ngardener whose domineering wife(Anne<br />\nHelms-Irons) he has survived by only a<br />\nfew years. Charles' return to the old<br />\nhouse after the funeral unlocks a flood<br />\nof memories and past conflicts; the action on stage duplicates his mental process as he relives his adolescence, the<br />\nrecollections of which are still so vivid<br />\nto him at age 40 that he finds himself<br />\ninteracting with them, offering comment, getting into arguments with the<br />\nghosts of his father, mother and former<br />\nself. As Charles relives these events, we<br />\nsee the warring forces that propel him<br />\ninto manhood.<br />\nMost of the memories center around<br />\nCharles' relationship with his father: a<br />\nman who, as Charles grows into manhood, comes to symbolize much less an<br />\nauthority figure or role model as a<br /><br />\npathetic figure who takes the world's<br />\npunishments without complaint or<br />\nstruggle.<br />\nUnder the hand of producing director Laurlene Straughn Pratt and technical directors Alicia Walters and Mark<br />\nWalters, the Tynan living room becomes<br />\na shadow box in which the elements of<br />\npast and present action constantly shift,<br />\noverlap, or oppose each other. Movement from one time frame to another is<br />\nfluid and easy to follow; the small space<br />\nis well utilized, alternately representing,<br />\namong other things, the seaside, the<br />\ncountry estate where Charles' father<br />\ngardens, and the office in which young<br />\nCharlie (Greg Kable) is given his first<br />\njob.<br />\nLeonard avoids the pitfall of presenting these excerpts from Charlie's life<br />\nwith the deliberate intent of exposing his<br />\nfamily life as a sham, or passing moral<br />\njudgment upon the way he was raised.<br />\nInstead, although the memories are<br />\nmediated through the adult Charles'<br />\nconsciousness, we are allowed to form<br />\nour own opinions about them, much as<br />\nCharles must do in his own mind, as a<br />\nway of confronting his past so that he<br />\nmay attempt to put it behind him.<br />\nHelms-Irons is a fearsome presence as<br />\nCharles' mother, coming across particularly well in a tense scene in which<br />\nshe makes young Charlie rewrite a letter to family friends because the first<br />\ndraft contained a literary reference.<br />\nKable provides heartfelt, impish representation of the young Charlie; Ralph<br />\nPiersanti is a strong presence in the supporting role of Drumm, Charles' first<br />\nemployer. Baileys plays the adult<br /><br />\nArts<br /><br />\nFather and son: Donald Hart and Daniel Baileys wait for Da's boat to come in.<br /><br />\nCharles passionately, as a man who can<br />\nremain wistful about his past even as it<br />\ntortures him.<br />\nHart is memorable but slightly<br />\ncaricaturish as Da; his best moments<br />\ncome in a jealous diatribe against his<br />\nwife's constant talk of the better life she<br />\nabandoned to marry him, and in an eerily effective scene in which an older,<br />\nsenile Da relives asking his wife's father<br />\nfor her hand. It is in these scenes that<br />\nwe glimpse something of the true nature<br />\nof Da's life, and the overwhelming hold<br />\nhis personality still retains on Charles'<br /><br />\nmemory.<br />\nThe play's only major flaw is that it<br />\n- never completely brings the elements of<br />\npast and present into equilibrium: no<br />\nfirm statements are made about Charles'<br />\nultimate success in dealing with his past;<br />\nno summation is offered of the worth<br />\nof Da's life and its significance for his<br />\nson. Otherwise, Da is a moving portrait<br />\nof an adult trying to make peace with<br />\nthe ghosts of his adolescence, and<br />\nunderstand the people and events that<br />\nshaped him into a man.<br /><br />\nSeminal Sax,<br /><br />\nCharles Lloyd Back on Top With Montreux '82<br />\nBY ANDY BIENSTOCK<br />\nCharles Lloyd was one of the more influential sax-men of the 1960s. Playing<br />\nwith, among others, Cannonball Adderly and Chico Hamilton, Lloyd was a<br />\nfollower of John Coltrane, soloing in<br />\nthe same frenetic manner. Although<br />\nLloyd was seldom as inspired or profound as Coltrane, he had a unique flair<br />\nfor combining difficult solos with hauntingly beautiful tunes.<br />\nLloyd chose to drop out of sight during the seventies. While in retirement he<br />\nmet his current quartet: French pianist<br />\nMichel Petrucciani; Palle Danielsson,<br />\nanother remarkable Scandinavian bassist; and Son Ship Theus, who has come<br />\na long way since his days with McCoy<br />\nTyner. Lloyd maintains that after<br />\nmeeting these men the urge within him<br />\nto create music \"called\" him out of<br />\nretirement. Such motives often make me<br />\nsuspicious, but when the result is on the<br />\norder of Lloyd's new album Montreux<br />\n'82, which was recorded live at last summer's Jazz Festival in Montreux, Switzerland, who gives a damn what the<br />\nmotives are? The Charles Lloyd Quartet<br />\nwas the sensation of the Montreux<br />\nFestival, and the album, released on the<br />\nElektra-Musician label, documents why.<br /><br />\n,.<br />\nIhe urge to create: words of wisdom, Lloyd.<br /><br />\nLloyd's playing has lost none of its<br />\nvitality, and the supporting trio lift him<br />\nto new heights. Lloyd's solos are still<br />\nsomewhat dense and convoluted, but<br />\nPetrucciani's airy piano keeps him from<br />\nbogging down. The album's second side<br />\nis a particular joy, opening with Bill<br />\nEvans' lovely composition \"Very Early,\" which progresses from the pretty<br />\nmelodic line into increasingly thick,<br />\nswirling solos. From \"Very Early,\"<br />\nLloyd lights into a short solo piece titled<br />\n\"Michel,\" and bounds from there into<br />\nthe opening, samba-inflected section of<br />\n\"Forest Flower.\" The recording of<br />\n\"Forest Flower (Sunrise and Sunset)\"<br />\nthat Lloyd did with Chico Hamilton and<br />\nGabor Szabo was a seminal '60s performance, and the quartet here is equal to<br />\nthe earlier group. Petrucciani leads the<br />\nway into the final, calypso portion of<br />\nthe tune, and one must wonder at his<br />\nskill\u2014which is amazing, because he suffers from a rare bone disease and is no<br />\nmore than four feet tall.<br />\nCurrent pop bands that claim to play<br />\ndance music should listen to this album,<br />\nand \"Forest Flower\" in particular; for<br />\nnot only is the music danceable, but the<br />\nmusic itself dances. It is a joyous finale<br />\nto a marvelous album.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 13<br /><br />\nWhat's Up This Week<br />\nFILM<br /><br />\nHour of the Furnaces(part one)<br />\n(Third World Film Series, Mergenthaler 1 1 1): This Argentinian film about political struggles in that country was hailed<br />\nby Pauline Kael as \"highly<br />\nsophisticated and conceived on<br />\nan epic scale.\" Pretty strong Kind Hearts and Coronets<br />\nwords even for Pauline, so you (Reel World, location TBA):<br />\nknow this must have some The English black comedy stars<br />\nThank God<br />\nmerit.

Exploiting the Athletes?<br />\nBY MICHAEL KUDUK<br />\nHerschel Walker is no longer a folk<br />\nhero in Georgia, or anywhere else, for<br />\nthat matter. The man who pulled people out of wrecked cars, and the man<br />\nwhom no football defense ever devised<br />\ncould stop, the same man who wore<br />\nnumber 34 for the Georgia Bulldogs<br />\nand who represented the state of<br />\nGeorgia and the entire South betrayed<br />\nevery one of his friends by turning professional. Walker was more than 4<br />\nfootball player\u2014he was an image of<br />\npride and integrity, a perfect model for<br />\nany young athlete. That image was<br />\nsmashed into millions of pieces\u2014the<br />\ndollar amount of his contract with the<br />\nNew Jersey Generals of the United<br />\nStates Football League.<br />\nMost experts agree that Walker's<br />\nsigning can only help the USFL.<br />\nBefore signing, the new league had a<br />\nfirm beginning\u2014solid ownership, firm<br />\ncommitments and two television contracts. Walker is an added publicity<br />\nboost, guaranteeing higher ticket sales<br />\nthan previously expected, and also<br />\nguaranteeing, through television<br />\nrevenues, that the new league's initial<br />\niea of red ink is only a shallow pond.<br />\nWalker's signing gave the USFL<br />\nrespect. The new league no longer has<br />\nthe reputation as a haven for green<br />\nrookies, over-the-hill veterans, retreads<br />\nand NFL rejects. It has an identity of<br />\nits own that will attract stars from both<br />\nthe college ranks and those of the NFL<br />\nas well. The USFL was a solid<br />\norganization to start with, with firm<br /><br />\nowners and plenty of money behind it.<br />\nNow it has something else\u2014glamour,<br />\nspecifically, Herschel Walker's<br />\nglamour. Singlehandedly, he has put the<br />\nnew league in a position to directly<br />\nrival the NFL for the football dollar.<br />\nThis new interleague rivalry could<br />\nvery well kill the USFL. Originally, the<br />\nUSFL intended to present football at<br />\na slightly lower caliber of play than in<br />\nthe NFL, but during the spring and<br />\nsummer instead of the fall. The USFL<br />\nnever really wanted direct competition<br />\nwith the ()icier league, but now, with<br />\nWalker, they get it. The NFL is a formidable foe, with resources in the form<br />\nof television contracts, ownership and<br />\nmassive fan support. It remains to be<br />\nseen what the USFL can lure from the<br />\nNFL.<br />\nThe other problem with Walker's<br />\nsigning was that he was an<br />\nundergraduate when he turned pro.<br />\nMost colleges do not want their football programs undermined by defecting sophomores and juniors, and as<br />\na result are barring the USFL from<br />\ntheir campuses. Without fresh college<br />\nplayers, the USFL is doomed to fail.<br />\nMany questions are left open after<br />\none of the most cataclysmic events in<br />\nfootball history. Will the USFL succeed, or will it fail like many of its<br />\npredecessors? Will the NFL resort to<br />\ndrafting undergraduates? What is the<br />\nfuture of the college draft itself? Who<br />\nwill stop Walker? Nobody in the NFL<br />\ncould have, so who will in the USFL?<br />\nOne thing is for certain\u2014live or die,<br />\nthe USFL has made its permanent<br />\nmark on American sports history.<br /><br />\nBY JOHN BEVILACQUA<br />\nThe signing of All-American<br />\nGeorgia running back, Herschel<br />\nWalker, for a reported $3 million per<br />\nyear, has given rise to many interesting<br />\nquestions. Will a bidding war break<br />\nout similar to the old AFL-NFL salary<br />\nbattles? Will Walker bring credibility<br />\nto the USFL just as Joe Namath did<br />\nfor the AFL? What will be the effect<br />\non the NFL salary structure? Will the<br />\nfak be the ones to pick up the tab once<br />\nagain? To me, however, the most interesting aspect of Walker's signing<br />\nwith the New Jersey Generals has been<br />\nthe response of college coaches and<br />\neducators.<br />\nFor the most part, college coaches<br />\nacross the nation were infuriated.<br />\nSome coaches have threatened USFL<br />\nrecruiters in order to protect their<br />\nballplayers and alldw them to get their<br />\neducation.<br />\nWhat the coaches fear most,<br />\nhowever, is not student athletes missing out on a diploma, but the elimination of an NFL (and supposed USFL)<br />\nrule of not signing football players until their class graduates. This<br />\nundergraduate singing rule was successfully challenged in court by college<br />\nbasketball players last year. Walker<br />\nhad threatened to challenge it last year,<br />\nbefore finally deciding to remain at<br />\nGeorgia.<br />\nJust whose interests does this rule<br />\nprotect in the long run? Isn't it in<br />\nWalker's interest to grab the big bucks<br />\n($15.5 million for five years) at the<br />\nheight of his marketability instead of<br />\nreturning to Georgia and risk a possi-<br /><br />\nble career-ending injury? If IBM offered a Hopkins undergrad $3 million<br />\nper year, would President Muller ban<br />\nall IBM recruiters from campus to<br />\nmake sure that all students receive their<br />\ndiplomas before advancing to greener<br />\npastures? Certainly not.<br />\nIt is clear that a player receiving his<br />\ndiploma is not the main interest of this<br />\nrule. This is aptly demonstrated by the<br />\nfact that approximately 70 percent of<br />\nthe players in the NFL have not received their college diplomas. If getting<br />\na college diploma was the main goal,<br />\nthis rule would be changed. It would<br />\nbe altered from barring players from<br />\nbeing signed until their college classes<br />\nhave graduated to prohibiting players<br />\nfrom signing until they have graduated<br />\nwith a degree.<br />\nUnder the present circumstances,<br />\nboth the colleges and the pros benefit.<br />\nAs 1(a Berkow, noted columnist for<br />\nThe New York Times, pointed out,<br />\n\"The colleges are happy because the<br />\nfootball player is around for four<br />\nyears. The pros are happy because they<br />\n1) look good as educational benefactors, and 2) don't have to pop for a<br />\nminor-league system, as major-league<br />\nbaseball does.\"<br />\nAs it stands now, unfortunately,<br />\nwhat is at the heart of the coaches'<br />\nviolent response is their fear of losing<br />\ntheir outstanding players and maingate attractions, and not the future of<br />\ntheir scholar-athletes.
