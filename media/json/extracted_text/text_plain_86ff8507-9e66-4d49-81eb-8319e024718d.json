One, stationed<br />\nPermanently at the one point of<br />\noutside access to the building on<br />\nweekends, permitted Johnson to<br />\nenter the building when he<br />\npresented proper identification.<br />\nIt could not be verified that<br />\nemployees of Johnson's status,<br />\nlab aide, had unrestricted access<br />\nto the building.

The attacker left,<br />\nsaid the police report, warning<br />\nthe victim not to \"call police or<br />\ntell anyone, or he would have his<br />\nfriends get her.\"<br />\nPolice apprehended Johnson<br />\nwhen he reported for work<br />\nyesterday morning. The victim<br />\nhad seen the assailant Sunday in<br />\nthe building approximately half<br />\nan hour before the attack. He<br />\nhad chet...ked in at 8:35 a.m. with<br />\n<br />\nthe sitting guard, and apparently<br />\nfled through a rear entrance.

He also mentioned some<br />\nproblems with the membership<br />\nof the Council itself. He said he<br />\nwas primarily concerned with the<br />\n\"representativesness\" of the<br />\ngroup.<br />\n\"The ASAC would be more<br />\nuseful the more representative it<br />\nis of student opinion,\" he<br />\n<br />\nexplained. Benton asserted tha<br />\ntthe \"problem in the past has<br />\nbeen that particular problems<br />\nbrought up for discussion have<br />\nbeen of more concern to the<br />\nparticular members of the<br />\nCouncil.\" Benton stated that he<br />\nwas concerned that the members<br />\nwere not really representing the<br />\nbroad points of view of the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nBut several members of the<br />\nCouncil expressed the opinion<br />\nthat it has the potential of being<br />\nan effective group.<br />\nBretherton's comment is fairly<br />\nrepresentative. \"The Council has<br />\nthe potential to be an extremely<br />\nimportant body if people make<br />\nup their minds to work,\" he<br />\nasserted.<br />\nHoward Majev, anothet<br />\nundergraduate member, held a<br />\nsimilar view. \"The ASAC has the<br />\npotential to be the most effective<br />\nadvisory group of its nature on<br />\nHomewood,\" he commented,<br />\n\"for it is charged with advising<br />\nBenton on virtually all matters.\"<br />\nGovernance<br />\nBenton also expressed his hope<br />\nthat the Council would be more<br />\neffective this year. \"I hope that<br />\nwe will be able to meet regularly<br />\nonce we get going. Personally I<br />\nwould like to see it meet every<br />\ntwo weeks,\" he explained.<br />\nThe ASAC was established two<br />\nyears ago after the Governance<br />\nreport was rejected by the<br />\nundergraduate student body. It<br />\nwas designed in response to<br />\nstudents who felt that they<br />\nneeded an input into the<br />\nadministration. The Council was<br />\nideally intended as a vehicle for<br />\nstudents to present their opinions<br />\nto the administration.<br />\n\"Unfortunately, it has not<br />\nworked out that way,\" Benton<br />\nsaid.<br />\nAccording to Larry Denton,<br />\nassistant to Vice President<br />\nBenton, \"The ASAC is now<br />\nreally a formal mode of<br />\ncommunication between the<br />\nadminstration and the two major<br />\ngroups on campus, the faculty<br />\nand the students.\"<br />\n<br />\nPazer on imported genius Creativity and public life<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nBy ROBERT PAULUS<br />\nHarvard -sociologist Nathan Glazer<br />\nSpoke on \"American Creativity I mported? yesterday in the third lecture<br />\nof the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium<br />\nOn<br />\nCreativity.<br />\nBefore a less than capacity audience in<br />\nS.hriver Hall, Glazer argued that mass<br />\nI mmigration at the beginning of 19th<br />\ncentury disrupted the homogenity of<br />\n<br />\nexisting American culture but produced a<br />\nnew, more universal source for American<br />\ncreativity.<br />\n\"American ethnic diversity combined<br />\nwith the impact of modernization has<br />\nhelped to create a new kind of high<br />\nculture divorced from specific cultural<br />\nroots,.\" said Glazer.<br />\nAccording to Glazer, by the end of the<br />\n18th century, America was both racially<br />\nand religiously a relatively homogenous<br />\nsociety. At the time of De Tocqueville's<br />\ntravels in 1830, \"an American culture<br />\nhad come into being\" stated Glazer.<br />\nHe noted, however, that by 1890,<br />\nimmigration from Eastern and Southern<br />\nEurope combined with the effects of<br />\nindustrialization and modernization<br />\nbroke down the initial, homogenous<br />\nsource of American creativity and created<br />\na newer, more diverse American culture<br />\nin its place.<br />\n\"The major contribution of American<br />\nethnic diversity to American cultural<br />\ncreativity was in the field of popular<br />\nculture and in the popular arts.\" said<br />\nGlazer.

Eisephower<br />\nSymposium, as noted in last Friday's<br />\neditorial, is significantly different from<br />\nthat of previous years, and rightly so. We<br />\ndo need a break from the monotonous<br />\npolitical rhetoric of the past, but more<br />\nimportantly, we need a chance to stop<br />\nand examine the purpose, procedure, and<br />\nworth of the deliberations of the last few<br />\nyears. A symposium on creativity<br />\nprovides us with the resting place we need<br />\n- to pause and reflect, and move on: to<br />\nsolve our basic problems using this gift of<br />\ncreativity. We cannot simply abandon<br />\nwhat you refer to as \"failures\", and<br />\ndiscuss only the successes man has<br />\naccrued. Your editorial, then, fails to<br />\nrecognize this real significance of the<br />\n1972 Symposium.<br />\nThere has been a frightening and<br />\nunhealthy turn in this country to the<br />\nbelief that anything political is innately<br />\nevil and worthless. Your editorial views<br />\nthis year's Symposium as a reaction to<br />\nthis belief. If this be the purpose of the<br />\ncurrent Symposium then it should be<br />\ncANvm\u2018e.mx\u2018e.A. *as vnit.takIAR,VN<br />\n<br />\nk.c1 \u2018t.%<br />\n<br />\nCW4 V%<br />\n<br />\nSymposium and point to the<br />\nof your editorial.<br />\nin<br />\n\"Creativity: The Moving Force of<br />\nSociety?' This Symposium will not<br />\nanswer that question. Rather, it will point<br />\nus in a direction where we might apply<br />\nour creative genius to solve our problems<br />\n- our political problems.<br />\nThis Symposium calls for the<br />\ntermination of the retreat from the issues<br />\nwhich confront us. It calls for a renewed<br />\ninvestigation of our political processes,<br />\nnot just political rhetoric, to create and<br />\nexamine the solutions to our problems.<br />\nAfter all, is not the test of creativity its<br />\n<br />\n'WAIT FOR THE DRUM-ROLL . .<br />\n<br />\ncommittees at Hopkins are, by tradition,<br />\nnotoriously ineffective. They meet only occassionally<br />\nwhen it is convient for the members, and end up with\u2022<br />\nlittle to show for their meager efforts. None of the<br />\ncommittee members seem to take their tasks very<br />\nseriously, and so their results are not taken seriously<br />\nby the University community. However, such groups<br />\nas the Blue Ribbon Panel have proved that committees<br />\ncan get together and accomplish their objectives. The<br />\nBRP's final report is presently being implemented by<br />\nthe Academic Council demonstrating the fact that this<br />\ngroup's work is being taken seriously.<br />\nWhile the Arts and Sciences Advisory Council<br />\n(ASAC) presently fits into the category of<br />\nmeaningless, ineffectual committees, the ASAC does<br />\nhave the potential of being a productive group. The<br />\nfact remains that Homewood Vice President George<br />\nBenton, chairman of the Council, has not yet called a<br />\nmeeting this year. As stated by members of the ASAC,<br />\nthe committee is only effective when it meets. In one<br />\nof its two meetings last year the Council voted down<br />\nthe outrageous proposal of a $25 fine on late course<br />\nadds and drops which would have been implemented<br />\nby Benton had the ASAC not opposed the measure.<br />\nThe group, obviously, has the potential to be a<br />\nfunctioning committe_ whose actions will be<br />\ninfluential. All the Council members, including<br />\nBenton, have stated optimistically that they feel the<br />\ngroup can be of some use when it meets.

Since I am a graduate<br />\nstudent, and I depend on a stipend to<br />\nkeep alive, I felt that some comment was<br />\ncalled for.<br />\nMost graduate students, almost all, in<br />\nfact, have no independent means of<br />\nsupport.

While I certainly think<br />\nthat these things are all fine, it hardly<br />\nseems logical to improve them at the<br />\nexpense of the primary goals of the<br />\nuniversity, one of which is to educate<br />\nstudents.

Once I even missed half of a<br />\nmidterm exam to see the Orioles<br />\ncomplete an indecisive win over<br />\nCincinatti. As for watching TV football<br />\nor basketball, I'd rather spend the time<br />\ndriving up the New Jersey Turnpike. but<br />\nthere's something about baseball that<br />\ntom. :s me, and something about the<br />\nWorld Series that distills the essential<br />\ndifference for me.<br />\nMany of my fondest memories recall<br />\nSunday afternoons at the Polo Grounds<br />\nwith my grandfather. We were always<br />\nsurrounded by other old Irish men from<br />\nthe Bronx, who came there by subway to<br />\nget away from their wives for a few<br />\nhours, and drink beer, and use curse<br />\nwords. Many recent memories have a<br />\nsimilar flavor. Like lying down on a<br />\nbleacher bench in Memorial Stadium,<br />\nwatching a game go a half mile or so<br />\naway, often more interested in the bets<br />\n\u2022 being placed all around me. Well the birds<br />\nstill got seven innings to catch up, and if<br />\nthey don't, there's still a hundred and<br />\ntwenty games left.<br />\nAnd it's this leisure, this philosophical<br />\npace, which makes baseball different<br />\nfrom football. Player and fan alike are<br />\nindividuals set against a task. The pitcher<br />\nsizes up the next pitch. Football is a race<br />\nagainst the clock; a race against the<br />\nseason schedule. From the sidelines,<br />\nowners and coaches try to squeeze out<br />\nmore productivity per man-hour.<br />\nLinemen are the unskilled laborers.<br />\nThey're paid to do what they're told and<br />\nnot think about how their task fits into<br />\nthe whole scheme. They injure themselves<br />\nmore, have to retire earlier, and are paid<br />\nless \u2014 all for the greater glory and gain of<br />\n<br />\nthe playlnakers. Football is a- game for<br />\nexecutives, which is why they always tell<br />\nyou in high school that the game builds<br />\ncharacter. It's the game of free enterprise,<br />\nit's politics, it's war. It's Nixon's game all<br />\nthe way. \"Here's the game plan for<br />\nSoutheast Asia: More pass blocking for<br />\nThieu, watch out for those sideline kicks<br />\ninto Laos. We'll have the elections during<br />\nhalf-time.\"<br />\nBut what's more likely with football is<br />\nthat you'll be watching on TV. because<br />\nnot even America is full of fat-cats, only<br />\npeople who aspire to being fat-cats. And<br />\nthe football mentality is why Nixon is<br />\nahead in all the polls. Not everyone is<br />\nreally rich enough to be helped by the<br />\nrich man's candidate, but almost<br />\neveryone aspires to being that rich.<br />\nHopeful voting.<br />\nIf baseball is dead, as all appearances<br />\nwould have it. it's because it required a<br />\nlife style gone from America. It was the<br />\nworking man's escape -- it was relaxation.<br />\nOn the TV. it was always brought to you<br />\nby razor blades and Schaeffer beer:<br />\nmaybe Speedy Alkaseltzer made a relief<br />\nappearance in the late innings. Football<br />\nsponsors aid their assault at the aspiring<br />\nfat-cat -- the Playboy subscriber who<br />\nwould like to come across like Johnny<br />\nCarson or Arnold Palmer if he could only<br />\ncontrol his appetite. TV football takes<br />\nadvantage of the fact that there's no<br />\nrelaxation anymore -- and that's because<br />\nnobody works, everybody thinks, and<br />\nthat's something you have to do all the<br />\ntime. So the Sunday afternoon sports<br />\nmatch becomes a time to ponder all the<br />\nthings that went wrong at the office<br />\nduring the week, to purge them all in<br />\nviolence of the game, and to resolve to be<br />\na better citizen: to eat more and use more<br />\ndeodorant and gasoline.<br />\nAh. But the World Series is still there.<br />\nThat old way of life can still have its<br />\nmoment in the limelight. Or so I thought.<br />\nI hadn't noticed what had been<br />\n<br />\nhappening over the past few years. The<br />\nopening of that first game didn't start off<br />\nwith the \"look sharp\" song, because they<br />\nweren't selling razor blades, they were<br />\nselling gasoline and life insurance.<br />\nFootball sponsors selling fat-ass status<br />\nand security. American Express (\"the<br />\nfreedom card\"), Credit Unions (\"it's<br />\nwhere you belong\"), Allstate Mortgage<br />\nInsurance (\"If you die early, young<br />\nman...\"), make hair spray (\"the wet head<br />\nis dear), super-regular Shell to propell<br />\nLee Trevino in his Big Dodge with the Big<br />\nTorsion Bar and Appolo-tested electronic<br />\nignition. I closed my eyes and had visions<br />\nof Snoopy the astronaut hitting golf balls<br />\non the moon. \"Merrill Lynch is bullshit<br />\non America.\"<br />\nThe coverage is electronically state of<br />\nthe art. Cameras in the dugouts. Slow<br />\nmotion instant replays from four<br />\ndifferent angles. Computerized statistics.<br />\nThe infield is technologically top-notch:<br />\nastro-turf.<br />\nBut the presentation won't go as<br />\nsmoothly as the ground balls -- and you<br />\ncan tell that from the moment the<br />\nmicrophone goes out on the woman<br />\nsinging the national anthem. And that's<br />\nbecause this is NBC - the dying network.<br />\nABC has the Olympics. CBS had the<br />\nSuperbowl. But NBC is cursed with a<br />\n\"hot\" game on a \"cool\" medium. Who<br />\ncan get into it? -- certainly not NBC. It's<br />\nlike their convention coverage: a lot of<br />\ntechnique. but not much purpose. Two<br />\nhomogenized hours brought to you in<br />\nliving lackluster. What was wrong with<br />\nblack and white? What was wrong with<br />\nMel Allen's nasal harangue and<br />\nbeer-flavored blunders as he narrated the<br />\nwaddle and spit of Casy Stengel? You<br />\nkeep hearing how baseball is so<br />\nslow-paced. It never used to bother the<br />\n_real baseball fan.<br />\nBut now they try to speed it up with<br />\nstatistics read outs between the pitches.<br />\nAnd that's why Nixon is the nation's<br />\n<br />\nnumber one baseball fan. There's no<br />\npower struggle in it for him to appreciate<br />\n-- but there are statistics, and Nixon is a<br />\nfact head; he never forgets. He listens to<br />\nCurt Gowdy between the pitches as<br />\nintently as he listens to Henry Kissinger<br />\nat a security council meeting.<br />\n\"He was 8 for twenty in the playoffs.\"<br />\n\"He struck out 87 left-handed batters<br />\nlast season.\"<br />\n\"Just look at the ripple of those<br />\nmuscles in this forearm when he grips<br />\nthat bat.\"<br />\nBut even that wouldn't be enough to<br />\ndrag the president away from the pressing<br />\naffairs of state. There's Nixon the<br />\npolitician to be satisfied. Normally,<br />\nbaseball is not that kind of game, but<br />\nthere is something particularly political<br />\nabout this World Series. The two teams<br />\nrepresent opposite life styles. It's the<br />\nloose and flashy youth of the A's against<br />\nthe middle-aged conventionality of the<br />\nDeds. The A's wearing long hair and<br />\nmoustaches on top of their green and<br />\ngold uniforms and white shoes. They are<br />\na mod revival of Admiral Doubleday. You<br />\nmight even go into their lockerroom and<br />\nsee a joint floating between a man named<br />\nCatfish and a man named Blue Moon.<br />\nTheir field style is just as flashy. They<br />\nbank on base running and pitching to<br />\novercome the overdog Deds.<br />\nWho look as straight as insurance<br />\nsalesmen. They keep their hair short by<br />\norder of the high command. And Johnny<br />\nBench, squatting behind the plate, calling<br />\nthe pitches, bears a certain resemblance<br />\nto J. Edgar Hoover. Their talent is hitting<br />\n-- compiling enough runs to cover a<br />\nmultitude of errors.<br />\nWell, in a way it's the McGovernites,<br />\nwith their fly-by-night ingenuity against<br />\nthe Republicans with their powerful bank<br />\naccounts. That's it. Nixon's watching this<br />\nSeries as a political oracle. Or maybe he's<br />\njust keeping his eyes in shape for the<br />\nfootball games.<br />\n<br />\nSome Snowismsfor you<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nPlease don't take it the wrong way--he<br />\nwas the epitome of a gentleman, and she<br />\nwas simply charming. But, my goodness,<br />\nsometimes folks from England, and this<br />\nincludes really wonderful people like the<br />\nSnows, are, oh,...a bit different from us.<br />\nMind you, the differences are what make<br />\nthe days so nice.<br />\nThursday afternoon, in the lobby of<br />\nthe Hilton: Lord and Lady Snow were<br />\njust about to register when they<br />\nrecognized a friend, Sir 'Roger.<br />\nLord S: Why Roger, old<br />\nman!

Before it was time to go onto<br />\nthe stage, the Snows talked about rivalry<br />\nbetween Oxford and Cambridge. Lady<br />\nSnow pooh-paahed it all--the rivalry is<br />\njust an American invention. Lord Snow<br />\nalmost agreed but said that when there<br />\nwere rowing contests, there was rivalry.<br />\n\"Cambridge always wins.\" A good<br />\nCambridge man.<br />\nLady Snow was happy to talk about<br />\nher family. \"Yes, our son is at Oxford,<br />\ntaking Russian and Chinese. He wants to<br />\nbe an international journalist--got bored<br />\nwith the classics, he's been taking Greek<br />\nsince he was eight, you know.\" He<br />\nhitchhiked from Capetown to Venice one<br />\nyear.

In the<br />\nChesapeake Restaurant Lord Snow freely<br />\nspeculated about the States and his own<br />\ncountry: \"The major difference between<br />\nthe U.S. and _Britain is that von have<br />\nsuspenders and',we nave (snap!) braces!'<br />\nA 'Marvelous suit.

The<br />\n<br />\ninterception and a<br />\ntouchdown-saving tackle, in<br />\naddition to turning in a fine job<br />\non the corner.<br />\nBut the real star was Thomas,<br />\nwho played a magnificent<br />\nall-around game--running, passing<br />\nand kicking the visitors into<br />\nsubmission.The 5'11\", 160 lb.<br />\njunior from Towson accounted<br />\nfor exactly 200 yards in<br />\nindividual total offense,<br />\ncompleting 11 of 21 passes for<br />\n<br />\nJack Thomas throws<br />\ndifference in'this contest was the<br />\ninspired play of their teammates,<br />\nwho mustered their finest overall<br />\nperformance in recent memory.<br />\nParticularly outstanding<br />\namong the less-heralded Blue<br />\nJays were halfback Harry<br />\nStringer, who rolled up 83 yards<br />\non 28 carries while subbing for<br />\nthe injured Timmy Doyle; Ron<br />\nHall, who recovered a fumbled<br />\nsnap on a Georgetown punt to<br />\nset up the clinching touchdown<br />\nand also picked off a pass to<br />\nthwart the last Hoya drive; and<br />\nsophomore defensive back Jack<br />\nCoulter, who contributed an,<br />\n<br />\n152 yards and adding 48 more on<br />\nthe ground. His scrambling kept<br />\nGeorgetown off-balance all day,<br />\nand he ran the option \"Keeper\"<br />\nplay to perfection. In addition,<br />\nJack booted three extra points<br />\nand punted four times for an<br />\naverage of 32 yards\u2014including a<br />\ngorgeous \"coffin corner\" kick<br />\nwhich set the Hoyas back to their<br />\nown 8-yard line and helped set<br />\nup the initial Hopkins score.<br />\nThe first series seemed to<br />\nindicate a long afternoon for the<br />\nhome team,as Georgetown rolled<br />\nto a touchdown almost at<br />\nwill-having to put the ball into<br />\n<br />\nthe air only once during an 82<br />\nyard march to paydirt.<br />\nTwenty-eight year old Vietnam<br />\nveteran Ralph Edwards dove one<br />\nyard for the score, but the Hoyas<br />\ngave a hint of what was to come<br />\nby badly missing the extra<br />\npoint--and being offside in the<br />\nprocess.<br />\nTime and again the visitors<br />\nmade sloppy plays unbecoming<br />\nan undefeated team, and the Blue<br />\nJays were quick to capitalize on<br />\nthe miscues. The most ill-advised<br />\neffort of all took place near the<br />\nend of the first quarter, and<br />\nsignalled the turning point of the<br />\ncontest. Jim Chesley of the<br />\nHoyas picked off a Thomas pass<br />\ndeep in his end zone and<br />\nfoolishly tried to run it out,<br />\nfumbling as he was hit on the<br />\n\u2022 goal line.. The Hopkins<br />\nqua .erback, as if to atone for<br />\nthe ,nterception, pounced on the<br />\nball at -the Georgetown one, and<br />\nsneaked the ball over for a<br />\n.touchdown two plays later.<br />\nThomas' kick for the extra point<br />\nwas good, and the Jays had a lead<br />\nthey never relinquished.<br />\nSeveral, minutes later, Hopkins<br />\nupped the count to 14-6 as<br />\nThomas completed three passes<br />\nto Billy Nolan, the last of which<br />\nwent for 13 yards and a TD to<br />\ncap a 63 yard 'drive. The march<br />\nwas kept alive by a big fumble<br />\nrecovery by Jim Duffy, a<br />\nfreshman offensive tackle making<br />\nhis first start.<br />\nRest<br />\nThe rest of the first half was<br />\nfairly uneventful, with<br />\nGeorgetown adding a 38 yard<br />\nfield goal by Skip Sawch just<br />\nbefore the gun to narrow the gap<br />\nto 14-9. However, Hopkins had<br />\nalready begun to shut off the<br />\nHoyas' vaunted running attack,<br />\n<br />\nOutplayed F&M wins 1-0<br />\nBy LAWRENCE WEINSTEIN<br />\nA goal by Tom Goskyla at the<br />\n18 minute mark of the second<br />\nhalf gave Franklin and Marshall a<br />\nmost undeserved and highly<br />\nimprobably soccer victory over<br />\nJohns Hopkins at Homewood<br />\nSaturday. The 1-0 defeat was the<br />\nsixth for Hopkins in seven games.<br />\nFive of the losses have been by a<br />\nsingle goal and this one was the<br />\nmost galling of all.<br />\nEarlier in the season, F and M<br />\nsomehow<br />\nmanaged to tie a<br />\nSPORTS<br />\nHaverford team<br />\nthat luckily<br />\nANALYSIS conquered<br />\nHopkins 4-1.<br />\nThe visiting Diplomats were<br />\nbereft of any originiality on<br />\neither offense or defense. From<br />\nstart to finish, their game plan<br />\nwas reduced to desperate clears<br />\ndown the field in hope of a single<br />\nbreak. Unfortunately, the break<br />\nwas indeed forthcoming and a<br />\nJHU squad which has discovered<br />\nthat skill alone doesn't produce<br />\nvictories was deprived of yet<br />\nanother one.<br />\nFranklin and Marshall<br />\ndominated at the outset. Six<br />\ntimes in the opening five minutes<br />\nthey shot and twice freshman<br />\ngoalie Jack Bukowski was forced<br />\nto make crucial saves. This was<br />\nthe extent of the visitors'<br />\noffense, however, and the Blue<br />\n<br />\nJays then assumed control. Joe<br />\nRutkowski had Hopkins' first<br />\nchance, a blast from 20 yards<br />\nthat goalie Scott Denne tipped<br />\njust over the bar.<br />\nOn the ensuing corner, a<br />\nfullback illegally handled the ball<br />\nand JHU was awarded a penalty<br />\nkick. Rutkowski's drive from the<br />\nspot beat Deere but hit the inside<br />\n<br />\nBruce Cazenave heading.<br />\nof the post and bounced safely<br />\naway.<br />\nHopkins continued to apply<br />\npressure and Roberto Arguer())<br />\ndrove a header from a Rutkowski<br />\ncross that was again cleared over<br />\nthe top by Deere. Rich Theibert<br />\nvolleyed barely wide past a<br />\nhalf-open net and Richie White<br />\ndrilled a short shot directly at the<br />\ngoalie. JHU dominated the first<br />\nhalf statistics, outshooting their<br />\nopponents 18-8 and leading in<br />\n<br />\ncorner kicks 11-1.<br />\nAfter the interval, superior<br />\nwork in the midfield by frosh<br />\nBruce Cazenave and Lou<br />\nPodrazik created yards of open<br />\nspace for the Blue Jay forwards.<br />\nDeere fumbled a corner from<br />\nPodrazik and Theibert's sliding<br />\ntry skidded wide again. Shortly<br />\nafter, Frank Curnoles hurled a<br />\nmarvelous throw-in to Marc<br />\nManzione whose open shot from<br />\n15 yards was saved brilliantly at<br />\nfull stretch by the tall Diplomat<br />\ngoalie.<br />\nFranklin and Marshall survived<br />\nall this and mounted their first<br />\noffensive thrust after a quarter of<br />\nan hour. Podrazik was called for<br />\na dangerous play in the area and<br />\nScott Miller took an indirect<br />\nkick from only 8 yards out.<br />\nCazenave blocked it neatly but<br />\nthe ball rolled free near the goal.<br />\nBukowski appeared to get his<br />\nhand on it but it squirted loose<br />\nonce again. Goskyla then hit a<br />\nshot straight at the goaltender<br />\nbut it was diverted off a leg and<br />\noozed over the line.<br />\nJHU resumed the offense but<br />\nthe Diplomats dropped 8 men<br />\nback and frustrated Hopkins to<br />\nthe end. The Blue Jays' total of<br />\n26 shots and 15 corners is<br />\nenough to win most games<br />\nhandily but Lady Luck<br />\napparently doesn't wish to smile<br />\non Hopkins this year.<br />\n<br />\nand was to continue to do so<br />\nthroughout the game.<br />\nThe only consistent gainer for<br />\nGeorgetown was a curl pass<br />\npattein from Jeff Gray to Steve<br />\nGraham which was completed<br />\nseven times in the first half alone.<br />\nBut when Jack Coulter and<br />\nGunter Glocker rose to the<br />\noccasion in the second half, and<br />\nshut off that pass, the Hoyas'<br />\noffense was crippled.<br />\nCold Melody<br />\nThe biggest play of the final<br />\nhalf was turned in by the defense<br />\nmidway through the third<br />\nquarter when the outcome was<br />\nstill very much in doubt.<br />\nGeorgetown elected to try for a<br />\nfirst down on a fourth-and-two<br />\nsituation at the Ilopkins 25, but<br />\nBrian Melody was stopped cold<br />\nby Glocker, Les Matthews and<br />\nBruce Parker, and the Blue Jays<br />\n<br />\ntook over.<br />\npn the -first play of the final<br />\nquarter, Thomas scored on an.<br />\noption run following Hall's<br />\nfumble recovery to make the<br />\nscore 21-9, and the Blue Jays<br />\nwere never threatened thereafter.<br />\nThe defense contained the<br />\nGeorgetown attack and the<br />\noffense managed to exercise<br />\nenough ball control to salt away<br />\nthe victory.<br />\nIn addition to those already<br />\nmentioned, the entire defensive<br />\nunit deserves special praise,<br />\nparticularly in the second half<br />\nwhen they limited their<br />\nopponents to just 74 yards of<br />\ntotal offense, while forcing three<br />\nturnovers. Sophomore defensive<br />\nback Rick Kramer, made several<br />\nkey tackles, and junior defensive<br />\nend Craig Stevens was a thorn in<br />\nthe Hoyas' side all afternoon.<br />\n<br />\ncomplete to Billy Nolan for long p in.<br />\n<br />\n\"B\" football team<br />\nbumps Arundel<br />\nThe Hopkins \"B\" football<br />\nteam thumped Anne Arundel<br />\nCommunity College by a score of<br />\n14-6 in a game played last Friday<br />\nat Anne Arundel.<br />\nIn winning, the Baby Jays ran<br />\nmore plays (55-52), gained more<br />\nnet yards rushing (189-27), and<br />\nhad more total yards (297-238)<br />\nthan the home team, an<br />\nimpressive feat in itself.<br />\nThe scoreless first quarter was<br />\nhighlighted by a pass interception<br />\nfor Hopkins by halfback Billy<br />\nJones. But for the most part, the<br />\nentire first quarter and first half<br />\nof the second quarter were<br />\nmarred by penalties and other<br />\nmistakes by both teams.<br />\nNear the end of the second<br />\nquarter, the stout Hopkins<br />\ndefense stopped Anne Arundel<br />\nwhen they had a first down on<br />\nthe Hopkins five yard line. The<br />\nball ended up on the seven where<br />\nthe offense took over,<br />\nAfter a three yard gain by<br />\nhalfback Jim Cahill, Jones carried<br />\ntwice for gains of 27 and seven<br />\nyards. Halfback Phil Alba carried<br />\nfor five to the 49. Quarterback<br />\nBilly Norbeck then fired a 44<br />\nyard bullet to the fleet Jones.<br />\nUnfortunately, Hopkins fumbled<br />\n<br />\non the next play.<br />\nAfter the defense held once<br />\nagain, Anne Arundel punted to<br />\ntheir own 43. On the last play of<br />\nthe half, Norbeck hit split end<br />\nMark Hylind with a scoring<br />\nstrike. The halfback sweep pass,<br />\nNorbeck pitching to Cirillo who<br />\ntossed to Alba, put two more<br />\npoints on the board after time<br />\nhad run out. Hopkins took an<br />\neight point lead into the locker<br />\nroom at halftime.<br />\nHopkins did not let up in the<br />\nsecond half, scoring once again in<br />\nthe third quarter. Mark Hylind<br />\nreturned a punt to the Anne<br />\nArundel, 42, from which Alba<br />\nand Cirillo ripped off 12 yards<br />\nrushing on the next three plays.<br />\nAfter an incomplete pa! s,<br />\nNorbeck hit Cirillo with a 1 3<br />\nyard pass for a first down on the<br />\n13.<br />\nThree plays later, Norbeck<br />\nscampered around end and<br />\nscored from ten yards out.

Last year, the<br />\nCouncil met only two times.<br />\nDr. Geoige Benton, Vice<br />\nPresident of Homewood<br />\nDivisions and chairman of the<br />\nASAC,was the first to admit that<br />\nhe had not used the Council to<br />\nits fullest last year.<br />\n\"It is my fault that the<br />\nCouncil met so infrequently last<br />\nyear,\" he commented, adding<br />\nthat there were so many things<br />\ngoing on with the reshuffling of<br /><br />\nvol. lxxvii, no. 14/tuesday, october, 24, 1972/baltimore, maryland/77th year<br /><br />\n.*0\u2018<br /><br />\nRape rocks School of Hygiene<br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\nA 25-year-old Hopkins student<br />\nwas raped Sunday noon in a<br />\nfourth floor laboratory at the<br />\nHopkins School of Hygiene on<br />\nthe 600 block of Wolfe Street.<br />\nPolice have charged a current<br />\nemployee at the School of<br />\nHygiene, 22 year-old George R.<br />\nJohnson of 40 East 25th Street,<br />\nwith rape.<br />\nTwo security guards were on<br />\nduty at the time of the incident,<br />\naccording to one of the guards on<br />\nduty. One, stationed<br />\nPermanently at the one point of<br />\noutside access to the building on<br />\nweekends, permitted Johnson to<br />\nenter the building when he<br />\npresented proper identification.<br />\nIt could not be verified that<br />\nemployees of Johnson's status,<br />\nlab aide, had unrestricted access<br />\nto the building. The other guard<br />\nPatrolled the interior and<br />\nexterior of the eight story<br /><br />\nbuilding.<br />\nPolice a re currently<br />\ninvestigating the possiblity of a<br />\nconnection between this and<br />\nsimilar incidents at the Hopkins<br />\nMedical Center last year.<br />\nThe assailant snuck into the<br />\nlab, according to the victim, and<br />\npressed a knife to her throat<br />\nfrom behind, and said \"Don't<br />\nyell.\"<br />\n. And Then<br />\nShe was forced to undress, the<br />\nyoung woman told police, and<br />\nthen raped. The attacker left,<br />\nsaid the police report, warning<br />\nthe victim not to \"call police or<br />\ntell anyone, or he would have his<br />\nfriends get her.\"<br />\nPolice apprehended Johnson<br />\nwhen he reported for work<br />\nyesterday morning. The victim<br />\nhad seen the assailant Sunday in<br />\nthe building approximately half<br />\nan hour before the attack. He<br />\nhad chet...ked in at 8:35 a.m. with<br /><br />\nthe sitting guard, and apparently<br />\nfled through a rear entrance. He<br />\nhad not checked out with the<br />\nfront desk.<br />\nArmed<br />\nThe attack came 10 days after<br />\ntwo attempted rapes on Hopkins'<br />\nCampus. At<br />\nHomewood<br />\nHomewood, security measures<br />\nhave been reinforced; a student<br />\nescort service funded by the<br />\nWork-Study program is now<br />\navailable, student patrolling is<br />\ncurrently under study, and the<br />\ncampus' security office is<br />\ncontemplating hiring a consultant<br />\nfirm to estimate the cost of<br />\nextensive lighting improvements<br />\naround dark areas. Since the<br />\nHomewood incidents, only one<br />\nnew Campus Policeman has been<br />\nhired.

He also mentioned some<br />\nproblems with the membership<br />\nof the Council itself. He said he<br />\nwas primarily concerned with the<br />\n\"representativesness\" of the<br />\ngroup.<br />\n\"The ASAC would be more<br />\nuseful the more representative it<br />\nis of student opinion,\" he<br /><br />\nexplained. Benton asserted tha<br />\ntthe \"problem in the past has<br />\nbeen that particular problems<br />\nbrought up for discussion have<br />\nbeen of more concern to the<br />\nparticular members of the<br />\nCouncil.\" Benton stated that he<br />\nwas concerned that the members<br />\nwere not really representing the<br />\nbroad points of view of the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nBut several members of the<br />\nCouncil expressed the opinion<br />\nthat it has the potential of being<br />\nan effective group.<br />\nBretherton's comment is fairly<br />\nrepresentative. \"The Council has<br />\nthe potential to be an extremely<br />\nimportant body if people make<br />\nup their minds to work,\" he<br />\nasserted.<br />\nHoward Majev, anothet<br />\nundergraduate member, held a<br />\nsimilar view. \"The ASAC has the<br />\npotential to be the most effective<br />\nadvisory group of its nature on<br />\nHomewood,\" he commented,<br />\n\"for it is charged with advising<br />\nBenton on virtually all matters.\"<br />\nGovernance<br />\nBenton also expressed his hope<br />\nthat the Council would be more<br />\neffective this year. \"I hope that<br />\nwe will be able to meet regularly<br />\nonce we get going. Personally I<br />\nwould like to see it meet every<br />\ntwo weeks,\" he explained.<br />\nThe ASAC was established two<br />\nyears ago after the Governance<br />\nreport was rejected by the<br />\nundergraduate student body. It<br />\nwas designed in response to<br />\nstudents who felt that they<br />\nneeded an input into the<br />\nadministration. The Council was<br />\nideally intended as a vehicle for<br />\nstudents to present their opinions<br />\nto the administration.<br />\n\"Unfortunately, it has not<br />\nworked out that way,\" Benton<br />\nsaid.<br />\nAccording to Larry Denton,<br />\nassistant to Vice President<br />\nBenton, \"The ASAC is now<br />\nreally a formal mode of<br />\ncommunication between the<br />\nadminstration and the two major<br />\ngroups on campus, the faculty<br />\nand the students.\"<br /><br />\nPazer on imported genius Creativity and public life<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nBy ROBERT PAULUS<br />\nHarvard -sociologist Nathan Glazer<br />\nSpoke on \"American Creativity I mported? yesterday in the third lecture<br />\nof the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium<br />\nOn<br />\nCreativity.<br />\nBefore a less than capacity audience in<br />\nS.hriver Hall, Glazer argued that mass<br />\nI mmigration at the beginning of 19th<br />\ncentury disrupted the homogenity of<br /><br />\nexisting American culture but produced a<br />\nnew, more universal source for American<br />\ncreativity.<br />\n\"American ethnic diversity combined<br />\nwith the impact of modernization has<br />\nhelped to create a new kind of high<br />\nculture divorced from specific cultural<br />\nroots,.\" said Glazer.<br />\nAccording to Glazer, by the end of the<br />\n18th century, America was both racially<br />\nand religiously a relatively homogenous<br />\nsociety. At the time of De Tocqueville's<br />\ntravels in 1830, \"an American culture<br />\nhad come into being\" stated Glazer.<br />\nHe noted, however, that by 1890,<br />\nimmigration from Eastern and Southern<br />\nEurope combined with the effects of<br />\nindustrialization and modernization<br />\nbroke down the initial, homogenous<br />\nsource of American creativity and created<br />\na newer, more diverse American culture<br />\nin its place.<br />\n\"The major contribution of American<br />\nethnic diversity to American cultural<br />\ncreativity was in the field of popular<br />\nculture and in the popular arts.\" said<br />\nGlazer. He stated that the result of this<br />\nincreased popularization of the arts was<br />\nthe creation of new mass cultures.<br /><br />\nsee GLAZER, page 7<br /><br />\nBy MARTIN FRENCH<br />\nC.P.

Eisephower<br />\nSymposium, as noted in last Friday's<br />\neditorial, is significantly different from<br />\nthat of previous years, and rightly so. We<br />\ndo need a break from the monotonous<br />\npolitical rhetoric of the past, but more<br />\nimportantly, we need a chance to stop<br />\nand examine the purpose, procedure, and<br />\nworth of the deliberations of the last few<br />\nyears. A symposium on creativity<br />\nprovides us with the resting place we need<br />\n- to pause and reflect, and move on: to<br />\nsolve our basic problems using this gift of<br />\ncreativity. We cannot simply abandon<br />\nwhat you refer to as \"failures\", and<br />\ndiscuss only the successes man has<br />\naccrued. Your editorial, then, fails to<br />\nrecognize this real significance of the<br />\n1972 Symposium.<br />\nThere has been a frightening and<br />\nunhealthy turn in this country to the<br />\nbelief that anything political is innately<br />\nevil and worthless. Your editorial views<br />\nthis year's Symposium as a reaction to<br />\nthis belief.

This Symposium will not<br />\nanswer that question. Rather, it will point<br />\nus in a direction where we might apply<br />\nour creative genius to solve our problems<br />\n- our political problems.<br />\nThis Symposium calls for the<br />\ntermination of the retreat from the issues<br />\nwhich confront us. It calls for a renewed<br />\ninvestigation of our political processes,<br />\nnot just political rhetoric, to create and<br />\nexamine the solutions to our problems.<br />\nAfter all, is not the test of creativity its<br /><br />\n'WAIT FOR THE DRUM-ROLL . .<br /><br />\ncommittees at Hopkins are, by tradition,<br />\nnotoriously ineffective. They meet only occassionally<br />\nwhen it is convient for the members, and end up with\u2022<br />\nlittle to show for their meager efforts. None of the<br />\ncommittee members seem to take their tasks very<br />\nseriously, and so their results are not taken seriously<br />\nby the University community. However, such groups<br />\nas the Blue Ribbon Panel have proved that committees<br />\ncan get together and accomplish their objectives. The<br />\nBRP's final report is presently being implemented by<br />\nthe Academic Council demonstrating the fact that this<br />\ngroup's work is being taken seriously.<br />\nWhile the Arts and Sciences Advisory Council<br />\n(ASAC) presently fits into the category of<br />\nmeaningless, ineffectual committees, the ASAC does<br />\nhave the potential of being a productive group. The<br />\nfact remains that Homewood Vice President George<br />\nBenton, chairman of the Council, has not yet called a<br />\nmeeting this year. As stated by members of the ASAC,<br />\nthe committee is only effective when it meets. In one<br />\nof its two meetings last year the Council voted down<br />\nthe outrageous proposal of a $25 fine on late course<br />\nadds and drops which would have been implemented<br />\nby Benton had the ASAC not opposed the measure.<br />\nThe group, obviously, has the potential to be a<br />\nfunctioning committe_ whose actions will be<br />\ninfluential. All the Council members, including<br />\nBenton, have stated optimistically that they feel the<br />\ngroup can be of some use when it meets.

Since I am a graduate<br />\nstudent, and I depend on a stipend to<br />\nkeep alive, I felt that some comment was<br />\ncalled for.<br />\nMost graduate students, almost all, in<br />\nfact, have no independent means of<br />\nsupport.

While I certainly think<br />\nthat these things are all fine, it hardly<br />\nseems logical to improve them at the<br />\nexpense of the primary goals of the<br />\nuniversity, one of which is to educate<br />\nstudents.

Once I even missed half of a<br />\nmidterm exam to see the Orioles<br />\ncomplete an indecisive win over<br />\nCincinatti. As for watching TV football<br />\nor basketball, I'd rather spend the time<br />\ndriving up the New Jersey Turnpike. but<br />\nthere's something about baseball that<br />\ntom. :s me, and something about the<br />\nWorld Series that distills the essential<br />\ndifference for me.<br />\nMany of my fondest memories recall<br />\nSunday afternoons at the Polo Grounds<br />\nwith my grandfather. We were always<br />\nsurrounded by other old Irish men from<br />\nthe Bronx, who came there by subway to<br />\nget away from their wives for a few<br />\nhours, and drink beer, and use curse<br />\nwords. Many recent memories have a<br />\nsimilar flavor. Like lying down on a<br />\nbleacher bench in Memorial Stadium,<br />\nwatching a game go a half mile or so<br />\naway, often more interested in the bets<br />\n\u2022 being placed all around me. Well the birds<br />\nstill got seven innings to catch up, and if<br />\nthey don't, there's still a hundred and<br />\ntwenty games left.<br />\nAnd it's this leisure, this philosophical<br />\npace, which makes baseball different<br />\nfrom football. Player and fan alike are<br />\nindividuals set against a task. The pitcher<br />\nsizes up the next pitch. Football is a race<br />\nagainst the clock; a race against the<br />\nseason schedule. From the sidelines,<br />\nowners and coaches try to squeeze out<br />\nmore productivity per man-hour.<br />\nLinemen are the unskilled laborers.<br />\nThey're paid to do what they're told and<br />\nnot think about how their task fits into<br />\nthe whole scheme. They injure themselves<br />\nmore, have to retire earlier, and are paid<br />\nless \u2014 all for the greater glory and gain of<br /><br />\nthe playlnakers. Football is a- game for<br />\nexecutives, which is why they always tell<br />\nyou in high school that the game builds<br />\ncharacter. It's the game of free enterprise,<br />\nit's politics, it's war. It's Nixon's game all<br />\nthe way. \"Here's the game plan for<br />\nSoutheast Asia: More pass blocking for<br />\nThieu, watch out for those sideline kicks<br />\ninto Laos. We'll have the elections during<br />\nhalf-time.\"<br />\nBut what's more likely with football is<br />\nthat you'll be watching on TV. because<br />\nnot even America is full of fat-cats, only<br />\npeople who aspire to being fat-cats. And<br />\nthe football mentality is why Nixon is<br />\nahead in all the polls. Not everyone is<br />\nreally rich enough to be helped by the<br />\nrich man's candidate, but almost<br />\neveryone aspires to being that rich.<br />\nHopeful voting.<br />\nIf baseball is dead, as all appearances<br />\nwould have it. it's because it required a<br />\nlife style gone from America. It was the<br />\nworking man's escape -- it was relaxation.<br />\nOn the TV. it was always brought to you<br />\nby razor blades and Schaeffer beer:<br />\nmaybe Speedy Alkaseltzer made a relief<br />\nappearance in the late innings. Football<br />\nsponsors aid their assault at the aspiring<br />\nfat-cat -- the Playboy subscriber who<br />\nwould like to come across like Johnny<br />\nCarson or Arnold Palmer if he could only<br />\ncontrol his appetite. TV football takes<br />\nadvantage of the fact that there's no<br />\nrelaxation anymore -- and that's because<br />\nnobody works, everybody thinks, and<br />\nthat's something you have to do all the<br />\ntime. So the Sunday afternoon sports<br />\nmatch becomes a time to ponder all the<br />\nthings that went wrong at the office<br />\nduring the week, to purge them all in<br />\nviolence of the game, and to resolve to be<br />\na better citizen: to eat more and use more<br />\ndeodorant and gasoline.<br />\nAh. But the World Series is still there.<br />\nThat old way of life can still have its<br />\nmoment in the limelight. Or so I thought.<br />\nI hadn't noticed what had been<br /><br />\nhappening over the past few years. The<br />\nopening of that first game didn't start off<br />\nwith the \"look sharp\" song, because they<br />\nweren't selling razor blades, they were<br />\nselling gasoline and life insurance.<br />\nFootball sponsors selling fat-ass status<br />\nand security. American Express (\"the<br />\nfreedom card\"), Credit Unions (\"it's<br />\nwhere you belong\"), Allstate Mortgage<br />\nInsurance (\"If you die early, young<br />\nman...\"), make hair spray (\"the wet head<br />\nis dear), super-regular Shell to propell<br />\nLee Trevino in his Big Dodge with the Big<br />\nTorsion Bar and Appolo-tested electronic<br />\nignition. I closed my eyes and had visions<br />\nof Snoopy the astronaut hitting golf balls<br />\non the moon. \"Merrill Lynch is bullshit<br />\non America.\"<br />\nThe coverage is electronically state of<br />\nthe art. Cameras in the dugouts. Slow<br />\nmotion instant replays from four<br />\ndifferent angles. Computerized statistics.<br />\nThe infield is technologically top-notch:<br />\nastro-turf.<br />\nBut the presentation won't go as<br />\nsmoothly as the ground balls -- and you<br />\ncan tell that from the moment the<br />\nmicrophone goes out on the woman<br />\nsinging the national anthem. And that's<br />\nbecause this is NBC - the dying network.<br />\nABC has the Olympics. CBS had the<br />\nSuperbowl. But NBC is cursed with a<br />\n\"hot\" game on a \"cool\" medium. Who<br />\ncan get into it? -- certainly not NBC. It's<br />\nlike their convention coverage: a lot of<br />\ntechnique. but not much purpose. Two<br />\nhomogenized hours brought to you in<br />\nliving lackluster. What was wrong with<br />\nblack and white? What was wrong with<br />\nMel Allen's nasal harangue and<br />\nbeer-flavored blunders as he narrated the<br />\nwaddle and spit of Casy Stengel? You<br />\nkeep hearing how baseball is so<br />\nslow-paced. It never used to bother the<br />\n_real baseball fan.<br />\nBut now they try to speed it up with<br />\nstatistics read outs between the pitches.<br />\nAnd that's why Nixon is the nation's<br /><br />\nnumber one baseball fan. There's no<br />\npower struggle in it for him to appreciate<br />\n-- but there are statistics, and Nixon is a<br />\nfact head; he never forgets. He listens to<br />\nCurt Gowdy between the pitches as<br />\nintently as he listens to Henry Kissinger<br />\nat a security council meeting.<br />\n\"He was 8 for twenty in the playoffs.\"<br />\n\"He struck out 87 left-handed batters<br />\nlast season.\"<br />\n\"Just look at the ripple of those<br />\nmuscles in this forearm when he grips<br />\nthat bat.\"<br />\nBut even that wouldn't be enough to<br />\ndrag the president away from the pressing<br />\naffairs of state. There's Nixon the<br />\npolitician to be satisfied. Normally,<br />\nbaseball is not that kind of game, but<br />\nthere is something particularly political<br />\nabout this World Series. The two teams<br />\nrepresent opposite life styles. It's the<br />\nloose and flashy youth of the A's against<br />\nthe middle-aged conventionality of the<br />\nDeds. The A's wearing long hair and<br />\nmoustaches on top of their green and<br />\ngold uniforms and white shoes. They are<br />\na mod revival of Admiral Doubleday. You<br />\nmight even go into their lockerroom and<br />\nsee a joint floating between a man named<br />\nCatfish and a man named Blue Moon.<br />\nTheir field style is just as flashy. They<br />\nbank on base running and pitching to<br />\novercome the overdog Deds.<br />\nWho look as straight as insurance<br />\nsalesmen. They keep their hair short by<br />\norder of the high command. And Johnny<br />\nBench, squatting behind the plate, calling<br />\nthe pitches, bears a certain resemblance<br />\nto J. Edgar Hoover. Their talent is hitting<br />\n-- compiling enough runs to cover a<br />\nmultitude of errors.<br />\nWell, in a way it's the McGovernites,<br />\nwith their fly-by-night ingenuity against<br />\nthe Republicans with their powerful bank<br />\naccounts. That's it. Nixon's watching this<br />\nSeries as a political oracle. Or maybe he's<br />\njust keeping his eyes in shape for the<br />\nfootball games.<br /><br />\nSome Snowismsfor you<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nPlease don't take it the wrong way--he<br />\nwas the epitome of a gentleman, and she<br />\nwas simply charming.

Before it was time to go onto<br />\nthe stage, the Snows talked about rivalry<br />\nbetween Oxford and Cambridge. Lady<br />\nSnow pooh-paahed it all--the rivalry is<br />\njust an American invention. Lord Snow<br />\nalmost agreed but said that when there<br />\nwere rowing contests, there was rivalry.<br />\n\"Cambridge always wins.\" A good<br />\nCambridge man.<br />\nLady Snow was happy to talk about<br />\nher family. \"Yes, our son is at Oxford,<br />\ntaking Russian and Chinese. He wants to<br />\nbe an international journalist--got bored<br />\nwith the classics, he's been taking Greek<br />\nsince he was eight, you know.\" He<br />\nhitchhiked from Capetown to Venice one<br />\nyear.

The<br /><br />\ninterception and a<br />\ntouchdown-saving tackle, in<br />\naddition to turning in a fine job<br />\non the corner.<br />\nBut the real star was Thomas,<br />\nwho played a magnificent<br />\nall-around game--running, passing<br />\nand kicking the visitors into<br />\nsubmission.The 5'11\", 160 lb.<br />\njunior from Towson accounted<br />\nfor exactly 200 yards in<br />\nindividual total offense,<br />\ncompleting 11 of 21 passes for<br /><br />\nJack Thomas throws<br />\ndifference in'this contest was the<br />\ninspired play of their teammates,<br />\nwho mustered their finest overall<br />\nperformance in recent memory.<br />\nParticularly outstanding<br />\namong the less-heralded Blue<br />\nJays were halfback Harry<br />\nStringer, who rolled up 83 yards<br />\non 28 carries while subbing for<br />\nthe injured Timmy Doyle; Ron<br />\nHall, who recovered a fumbled<br />\nsnap on a Georgetown punt to<br />\nset up the clinching touchdown<br />\nand also picked off a pass to<br />\nthwart the last Hoya drive; and<br />\nsophomore defensive back Jack<br />\nCoulter, who contributed an,<br /><br />\n152 yards and adding 48 more on<br />\nthe ground. His scrambling kept<br />\nGeorgetown off-balance all day,<br />\nand he ran the option \"Keeper\"<br />\nplay to perfection. In addition,<br />\nJack booted three extra points<br />\nand punted four times for an<br />\naverage of 32 yards\u2014including a<br />\ngorgeous \"coffin corner\" kick<br />\nwhich set the Hoyas back to their<br />\nown 8-yard line and helped set<br />\nup the initial Hopkins score.<br />\nThe first series seemed to<br />\nindicate a long afternoon for the<br />\nhome team,as Georgetown rolled<br />\nto a touchdown almost at<br />\nwill-having to put the ball into<br /><br />\nthe air only once during an 82<br />\nyard march to paydirt.<br />\nTwenty-eight year old Vietnam<br />\nveteran Ralph Edwards dove one<br />\nyard for the score, but the Hoyas<br />\ngave a hint of what was to come<br />\nby badly missing the extra<br />\npoint--and being offside in the<br />\nprocess.<br />\nTime and again the visitors<br />\nmade sloppy plays unbecoming<br />\nan undefeated team, and the Blue<br />\nJays were quick to capitalize on<br />\nthe miscues. The most ill-advised<br />\neffort of all took place near the<br />\nend of the first quarter, and<br />\nsignalled the turning point of the<br />\ncontest. Jim Chesley of the<br />\nHoyas picked off a Thomas pass<br />\ndeep in his end zone and<br />\nfoolishly tried to run it out,<br />\nfumbling as he was hit on the<br />\n\u2022 goal line.. The Hopkins<br />\nqua .erback, as if to atone for<br />\nthe ,nterception, pounced on the<br />\nball at -the Georgetown one, and<br />\nsneaked the ball over for a<br />\n.touchdown two plays later.<br />\nThomas' kick for the extra point<br />\nwas good, and the Jays had a lead<br />\nthey never relinquished.<br />\nSeveral, minutes later, Hopkins<br />\nupped the count to 14-6 as<br />\nThomas completed three passes<br />\nto Billy Nolan, the last of which<br />\nwent for 13 yards and a TD to<br />\ncap a 63 yard 'drive. The march<br />\nwas kept alive by a big fumble<br />\nrecovery by Jim Duffy, a<br />\nfreshman offensive tackle making<br />\nhis first start.<br />\nRest<br />\nThe rest of the first half was<br />\nfairly uneventful, with<br />\nGeorgetown adding a 38 yard<br />\nfield goal by Skip Sawch just<br />\nbefore the gun to narrow the gap<br />\nto 14-9. However, Hopkins had<br />\nalready begun to shut off the<br />\nHoyas' vaunted running attack,<br /><br />\nOutplayed F&amp;M wins 1-0<br />\nBy LAWRENCE WEINSTEIN<br />\nA goal by Tom Goskyla at the<br />\n18 minute mark of the second<br />\nhalf gave Franklin and Marshall a<br />\nmost undeserved and highly<br />\nimprobably soccer victory over<br />\nJohns Hopkins at Homewood<br />\nSaturday. The 1-0 defeat was the<br />\nsixth for Hopkins in seven games.<br />\nFive of the losses have been by a<br />\nsingle goal and this one was the<br />\nmost galling of all.<br />\nEarlier in the season, F and M<br />\nsomehow<br />\nmanaged to tie a<br />\nSPORTS<br />\nHaverford team<br />\nthat luckily<br />\nANALYSIS conquered<br />\nHopkins 4-1.<br />\nThe visiting Diplomats were<br />\nbereft of any originiality on<br />\neither offense or defense. From<br />\nstart to finish, their game plan<br />\nwas reduced to desperate clears<br />\ndown the field in hope of a single<br />\nbreak. Unfortunately, the break<br />\nwas indeed forthcoming and a<br />\nJHU squad which has discovered<br />\nthat skill alone doesn't produce<br />\nvictories was deprived of yet<br />\nanother one.<br />\nFranklin and Marshall<br />\ndominated at the outset. Six<br />\ntimes in the opening five minutes<br />\nthey shot and twice freshman<br />\ngoalie Jack Bukowski was forced<br />\nto make crucial saves. This was<br />\nthe extent of the visitors'<br />\noffense, however, and the Blue<br /><br />\nJays then assumed control. Joe<br />\nRutkowski had Hopkins' first<br />\nchance, a blast from 20 yards<br />\nthat goalie Scott Denne tipped<br />\njust over the bar.<br />\nOn the ensuing corner, a<br />\nfullback illegally handled the ball<br />\nand JHU was awarded a penalty<br />\nkick. Rutkowski's drive from the<br />\nspot beat Deere but hit the inside<br /><br />\nBruce Cazenave heading.<br />\nof the post and bounced safely<br />\naway.<br />\nHopkins continued to apply<br />\npressure and Roberto Arguer())<br />\ndrove a header from a Rutkowski<br />\ncross that was again cleared over<br />\nthe top by Deere. Rich Theibert<br />\nvolleyed barely wide past a<br />\nhalf-open net and Richie White<br />\ndrilled a short shot directly at the<br />\ngoalie. JHU dominated the first<br />\nhalf statistics, outshooting their<br />\nopponents 18-8 and leading in<br /><br />\ncorner kicks 11-1.<br />\nAfter the interval, superior<br />\nwork in the midfield by frosh<br />\nBruce Cazenave and Lou<br />\nPodrazik created yards of open<br />\nspace for the Blue Jay forwards.<br />\nDeere fumbled a corner from<br />\nPodrazik and Theibert's sliding<br />\ntry skidded wide again. Shortly<br />\nafter, Frank Curnoles hurled a<br />\nmarvelous throw-in to Marc<br />\nManzione whose open shot from<br />\n15 yards was saved brilliantly at<br />\nfull stretch by the tall Diplomat<br />\ngoalie.<br />\nFranklin and Marshall survived<br />\nall this and mounted their first<br />\noffensive thrust after a quarter of<br />\nan hour. Podrazik was called for<br />\na dangerous play in the area and<br />\nScott Miller took an indirect<br />\nkick from only 8 yards out.<br />\nCazenave blocked it neatly but<br />\nthe ball rolled free near the goal.<br />\nBukowski appeared to get his<br />\nhand on it but it squirted loose<br />\nonce again. Goskyla then hit a<br />\nshot straight at the goaltender<br />\nbut it was diverted off a leg and<br />\noozed over the line.<br />\nJHU resumed the offense but<br />\nthe Diplomats dropped 8 men<br />\nback and frustrated Hopkins to<br />\nthe end. The Blue Jays' total of<br />\n26 shots and 15 corners is<br />\nenough to win most games<br />\nhandily but Lady Luck<br />\napparently doesn't wish to smile<br />\non Hopkins this year.<br /><br />\nand was to continue to do so<br />\nthroughout the game.<br />\nThe only consistent gainer for<br />\nGeorgetown was a curl pass<br />\npattein from Jeff Gray to Steve<br />\nGraham which was completed<br />\nseven times in the first half alone.<br />\nBut when Jack Coulter and<br />\nGunter Glocker rose to the<br />\noccasion in the second half, and<br />\nshut off that pass, the Hoyas'<br />\noffense was crippled.<br />\nCold Melody<br />\nThe biggest play of the final<br />\nhalf was turned in by the defense<br />\nmidway through the third<br />\nquarter when the outcome was<br />\nstill very much in doubt.<br />\nGeorgetown elected to try for a<br />\nfirst down on a fourth-and-two<br />\nsituation at the Ilopkins 25, but<br />\nBrian Melody was stopped cold<br />\nby Glocker, Les Matthews and<br />\nBruce Parker, and the Blue Jays<br /><br />\ntook over.<br />\npn the -first play of the final<br />\nquarter, Thomas scored on an.<br />\noption run following Hall's<br />\nfumble recovery to make the<br />\nscore 21-9, and the Blue Jays<br />\nwere never threatened thereafter.<br />\nThe defense contained the<br />\nGeorgetown attack and the<br />\noffense managed to exercise<br />\nenough ball control to salt away<br />\nthe victory.<br />\nIn addition to those already<br />\nmentioned, the entire defensive<br />\nunit deserves special praise,<br />\nparticularly in the second half<br />\nwhen they limited their<br />\nopponents to just 74 yards of<br />\ntotal offense, while forcing three<br />\nturnovers. Sophomore defensive<br />\nback Rick Kramer, made several<br />\nkey tackles, and junior defensive<br />\nend Craig Stevens was a thorn in<br />\nthe Hoyas' side all afternoon.<br /><br />\ncomplete to Billy Nolan for long p in.<br /><br />\n\"B\" football team<br />\nbumps Arundel<br />\nThe Hopkins \"B\" football<br />\nteam thumped Anne Arundel<br />\nCommunity College by a score of<br />\n14-6 in a game played last Friday<br />\nat Anne Arundel.<br />\nIn winning, the Baby Jays ran<br />\nmore plays (55-52), gained more<br />\nnet yards rushing (189-27), and<br />\nhad more total yards (297-238)<br />\nthan the home team, an<br />\nimpressive feat in itself.<br />\nThe scoreless first quarter was<br />\nhighlighted by a pass interception<br />\nfor Hopkins by halfback Billy<br />\nJones. But for the most part, the<br />\nentire first quarter and first half<br />\nof the second quarter were<br />\nmarred by penalties and other<br />\nmistakes by both teams.<br />\nNear the end of the second<br />\nquarter, the stout Hopkins<br />\ndefense stopped Anne Arundel<br />\nwhen they had a first down on<br />\nthe Hopkins five yard line. The<br />\nball ended up on the seven where<br />\nthe offense took over,<br />\nAfter a three yard gain by<br />\nhalfback Jim Cahill, Jones carried<br />\ntwice for gains of 27 and seven<br />\nyards. Halfback Phil Alba carried<br />\nfor five to the 49. Quarterback<br />\nBilly Norbeck then fired a 44<br />\nyard bullet to the fleet Jones.<br />\nUnfortunately, Hopkins fumbled<br /><br />\non the next play.<br />\nAfter the defense held once<br />\nagain, Anne Arundel punted to<br />\ntheir own 43. On the last play of<br />\nthe half, Norbeck hit split end<br />\nMark Hylind with a scoring<br />\nstrike. The halfback sweep pass,<br />\nNorbeck pitching to Cirillo who<br />\ntossed to Alba, put two more<br />\npoints on the board after time<br />\nhad run out. Hopkins took an<br />\neight point lead into the locker<br />\nroom at halftime.<br />\nHopkins did not let up in the<br />\nsecond half, scoring once again in<br />\nthe third quarter. Mark Hylind<br />\nreturned a punt to the Anne<br />\nArundel, 42, from which Alba<br />\nand Cirillo ripped off 12 yards<br />\nrushing on the next three plays.<br />\nAfter an incomplete pa! s,<br />\nNorbeck hit Cirillo with a 1 3<br />\nyard pass for a first down on the<br />\n13.<br />\nThree plays later, Norbeck<br />\nscampered around end and<br />\nscored from ten yards out. The<br />\nkick failed, so Hopkins led by a<br />\nscore of 14-0.<br />\nThe score held up until the k st<br />\ntwo minutes of the game wh eli<br />\nAnne Arundel culminated a 58<br />\nyard drive with a 12 yard pass, to<br />\nmake the final score, 14-6.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University fall lacrosse team will oPe<br />\nits brief 1972 campaign tomorrow afternoon against UMB(<br />\n3:30 on the practice field adjacent to Garland Hall.
