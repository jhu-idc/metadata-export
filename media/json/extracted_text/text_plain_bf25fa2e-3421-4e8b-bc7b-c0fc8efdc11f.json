Dr.<br />\nSwanson emphasized this point<br />\nin saying: \"If we don't have an<br />\nexcellent faculty, all else is<br />\nworthless.\"<br />\nIn increasing the quality of the<br />\nfaculty which ultimately results<br />\nin a commensurate increase in<br />\nquality, the University must<br />\nrecognize its limitations. The potentialities of the University are<br />\nlimited by its finances. The Long<br />\nRange Committee must fit the<br />\nrecommendations to meet the<br />\nresources. Consequently it must<br />\nbe remembered, Swanson<br />\nstressed, that faculty may be<br />\nmade either more exceptional in<br />\nevery field and concentrate on<br />\nno special department, or it may<br />\nstress the creaticn of a few individual departments with depth<br />\nand extensive ability in lieu of<br />\na large amount of scattered<br />\ntalent.<br />\nThe preferable condition is to<br />\nlimit the number of departments<br />\nand maximize the excellence in<br />\na few fields. Just as each must be<br />\nprotected in depth to keep from<br />\nhaving holes in a given area, the<br />\ndepartments must be encouraged<br />\nto create a vitality and loyalty<br />\nin order to provide a more than<br />\nmaterial attachment for the prospective professors.<br />\nBy their emphasis on the<br />\n<br />\nworth of the individual departments, the committee does not<br />\nrecommend an academic stratification of the school. They<br />\nwould rather build up each department for managerial purposes. Dr. Swanson stressed concern over the fact that major<br />\nuniversity<br />\nare<br />\nappointments<br />\naffairs and not departmental affairs.

Advocates of this theory insist the plays<br />\nare so full of classical allusions and learned references that. they<br />\ncouldn't possibly have been written by the son of an illiterate<br />\ncountry butcher.<br />\nTo which I reply \"Faugh!\" Was not the great Spinoza's fat her<br />\na humble woodcutter?

It used to break young Isaac's<br />\nheart to see his father get up every morning, put on uniform,<br />\nspikes, glove, and cap, and stand alertly behind second base,<br />\nbent forward, eyes narrowed, waiting, waiting, waiting. That's<br />\nall\u2014waiting. Isaac loyally sat in the bleachers and yelled \"Good<br />\nshow, Dad!\" and stuff like that, but everyone else in town sniggered derisively, made coarse gestures, and pelted the Newtons<br />\nwith overripe fruit\u2014figs for the elder Newton, apples for the<br />\nyounger. Thus, as we all know, the famous moment came when<br />\nIsaac Newton,struck in the head with an apple, leapt to his feet,<br />\nshouted \"Europa!\" and announced the third law of motion:\"For<br />\nevery action there is an opposite and equal reaction!'<br />\n<br />\nCARRY OUT SERVICE<br />\n<br />\nSPAGHETTI MEALS<br />\n<br />\nCALL 889-3831<br />\n<br />\nPIZZA PIE A SPECIALTY<br />\n<br />\nRECORDS<br />\nMONO and STEREO<br />\n<br />\nts,\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 CLASSICAL \u2022 FOLK \u2022 POP<br />\n\u2022 SPOKEN \u2022 JAZZ \u2022 IMPORTS<br />\nLargest Selection Anywhere<br />\n<br />\nDISCOUNT PRICES<br />\nESOTERICA OUR SPECIALTY<br />\n<br />\nFigs for the elder Newton, apples for the younger.<br />\n<br />\nNAT BARNETT'S<br />\n<br />\nHI Fl RECORD SHOP<br />\nFREE PARKING<br />\n<br />\n2580 McCULLOH STREET<br />\n<br />\nSUPERIORITY COMPLEX<br />\nNOW SELLING FOR .50<br />\nSo you're not a football hero, a big Brain, or a hot<br />\nHot-rodder.

Back to Shakespeare (or \"The Gem of the<br />\nOcean\" as he was ribaldly- appelated).<br />\nShakespeare's most important play is, of course, Hamlet (or,<br />\nas it is frequently called, Macbeth). This play tells in living color<br />\nthe story of Hamlet., Prince of Denmark, who one night sees a<br />\nghost upon the battlements.(Possibly it is a goat he sees; I have<br />\na first folio that is frankly not too legible.) Anyhow,Hamlet is so<br />\nupset by seeing this ghost (or goat.) that he stabs Polonius and<br />\nBrer Bodkin. He is thereupon banished to a leather factory by<br />\nthe king, who hollers, \"Get thee to a tannery!\" Thereupon<br />\nOphelia refuses her food until Laertes shouts, \"Get thee to a<br />\nbeanery!\" Ophelia is so cross that she chases her little dog out of<br />\nthe room,crying,\"Out,damned Spot!\" She is fined fifty shillings<br />\nfor cussing, but Portia,in an eloquent plea, gets the sentence<br />\nmuted to life imprisonment. Thereupon King Lear and Queen<br />\nMab proclaim a festival\u2014complete with kissing games and a<br />\npie-eating contest. Everybody has a perfectly splendid time until<br />\nBanquo's ghost(or goat)shows up. This so unhinges Richard III<br />\nthat he drowns his cousin, Butt Malmsey. This leads to a lively<br />\ndiscussion, during which everyone is killed.

Dr.<br />\nSwanson emphasized this point<br />\nin saying: \"If we don't have an<br />\nexcellent faculty, all else is<br />\nworthless.\"<br />\nIn increasing the quality of the<br />\nfaculty which ultimately results<br />\nin a commensurate increase in<br />\nquality, the University must<br />\nrecognize its limitations. The potentialities of the University are<br />\nlimited by its finances. The Long<br />\nRange Committee must fit the<br />\nrecommendations to meet the<br />\nresources. Consequently it must<br />\nbe remembered, Swanson<br />\nstressed, that faculty may be<br />\nmade either more exceptional in<br />\nevery field and concentrate on<br />\nno special department, or it may<br />\nstress the creaticn of a few individual departments with depth<br />\nand extensive ability in lieu of<br />\na large amount of scattered<br />\ntalent.<br />\nThe preferable condition is to<br />\nlimit the number of departments<br />\nand maximize the excellence in<br />\na few fields. Just as each must be<br />\nprotected in depth to keep from<br />\nhaving holes in a given area, the<br />\ndepartments must be encouraged<br />\nto create a vitality and loyalty<br />\nin order to provide a more than<br />\nmaterial attachment for the prospective professors.<br />\nBy their emphasis on the<br /><br />\nworth of the individual departments, the committee does not<br />\nrecommend an academic stratification of the school. They<br />\nwould rather build up each department for managerial purposes. Dr. Swanson stressed concern over the fact that major<br />\nuniversity<br />\nare<br />\nappointments<br />\naffairs and not departmental affairs. He would like appointments to be considered on the<br />\nbasis of a University decision<br />\nrather than on a single department's request.<br />\nThe planning committee has<br />\nbased its considerations on a single theme: that the faculty's<br />\nexcellence, once established, will<br />\nimpart an overall excllence to<br />\nthe University, providing three<br />\nconditions; 1. that there is an<br />\n2.<br />\nadministration,<br />\nadaptable<br />\nthat there is a cooperating<br />\nunity to the University, and 3.<br />\nthat there is a recognition that<br />\nall objectives are resolved in<br />\nterms of money and the limitations thereof.<br />\nThe welding of all the HomeMedical<br />\nSchools, the<br />\nwood<br />\nschools, and the Hygiene School<br />\ninto one University center, the<br />\nwelding of single departments<br />\ninto vital and stimulating centers of scholarship, and finally<br />\nincreased competitive scholarships, fellowship money, with<br />\ntime required for<br />\ndecreased<br />\nPh.

Back to Shakespeare (or \"The Gem of the<br />\nOcean\" as he was ribaldly- appelated).<br />\nShakespeare's most important play is, of course, Hamlet (or,<br />\nas it is frequently called, Macbeth). This play tells in living color<br />\nthe story of Hamlet., Prince of Denmark, who one night sees a<br />\nghost upon the battlements.(Possibly it is a goat he sees; I have<br />\na first folio that is frankly not too legible.) Anyhow,Hamlet is so<br />\nupset by seeing this ghost (or goat.) that he stabs Polonius and<br />\nBrer Bodkin. He is thereupon banished to a leather factory by<br />\nthe king, who hollers, \"Get thee to a tannery!\" Thereupon<br />\nOphelia refuses her food until Laertes shouts, \"Get thee to a<br />\nbeanery!\" Ophelia is so cross that she chases her little dog out of<br />\nthe room,crying,\"Out,damned Spot!\" She is fined fifty shillings<br />\nfor cussing, but Portia,in an eloquent plea, gets the sentence<br />\nmuted to life imprisonment. Thereupon King Lear and Queen<br />\nMab proclaim a festival\u2014complete with kissing games and a<br />\npie-eating contest. Everybody has a perfectly splendid time until<br />\nBanquo's ghost(or goat)shows up. This so unhinges Richard III<br />\nthat he drowns his cousin, Butt Malmsey. This leads to a lively<br />\ndiscussion, during which everyone is killed.
