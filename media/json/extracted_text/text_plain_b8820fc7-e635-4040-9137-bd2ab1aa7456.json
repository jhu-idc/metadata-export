In reality, however,<br />\nit is an important step forward and is a<br />\nsolution to a major problem which has<br />\nconfronted both new and old students each<br />\nOctober.<br />\nNo one can deny that no less than ten<br />\ndays are usually lost at the opening of<br />\nthe University because of the poor system of assigning students to classes. This<br />\nis valuable time lost to every student and<br />\nto every instructor. The solution to the<br />\nproblem, it seems, lies in the plans which<br />\nRyland N. Dempster, registrar, has been<br />\ninstrumental in promulgating.<br />\nIn the past, the registrar's office drew<br />\nup a schedule for all the classes given in<br />\nthe undergraduate departments, which<br />\nwas published in the catalog for each<br />\nschool. Usually the student knows, from<br />\nthe start, long before registration, what<br />\ncourses he must and wants to take. He<br />\nfills out his own schedule of hours, in<br />\nmost cases, and shows it to his advisor<br />\nwhen he is assigned to one on the day<br />\nof registration. The advisor, generally<br />\nokays it, after giving a good pretense of<br />\nbeing much concerned in the welfare of<br />\nthe undergraduate who is his advisee for<br />\nthe year.<br />\nWhat happens? The student reports to<br />\nclass. There he is either told he doesn't<br />\nbelong there for one or two of ten reasons, or he is told that he must report to<br />\nanother section of that class. That picture is a familiar one to all undergraduates. The student then chases to his advisor's office to report the matter and to<br />\nask to be straightened out at once. But<br />\nhe finds that his advisor is not in and<br />\ndoesn't make a practice of keeping office<br />\nhours. Several days pass by before he<br />\nfinds some means of straightening out the<br />\ndifficulty. In the meantime, actual class<br />\nwork has not begun, for the instructors<br />\nfind it is useless in the turmoil of sectioning courses, making changes, and trying to find more room for overcrowded<br />\nclasses.<br />\nThe solution to the situation was simple and yet no move was made until<br />\nthis year to put it into effect. All that<br />\nwas necessary was to schedule sections<br />\nfor each required freshman and sophomore class, especially, and to arrange the<br />\nhours of these sections in such a manner<br />\nin two groups of days\u2014Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Friday<br />\nand Saturday\u2014so that there would be no<br />\nconflicts in the student's required underclass courses. With two required courses<br />\nscheduled at the beginning of the week,<br />\neither in the morning or the afternoon,<br />\nfor example, and with two scheduled in<br />\nthe latter part of the week, the student<br />\ncould fit in the subjects he is supposed to<br />\ntake. The courses which most likely will<br />\nbe sectioned immediately by the registrar are English writing, mathematics,<br />\nFrench, English literature, German, biology, chemistry, physics, freshman and<br />\n<br />\nsophomore history.<br />\nUnder this new plan the student will<br />\n<br />\n\u2018\u2018<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nm working and Smoking overtime.,<br />\n<br />\nhence ait&<br />\n<br />\nHEN I work hard, I usually<br />\nsmoke more; and when I smoke<br />\nmore,I usually work harder\u2014and that's<br />\nwhy I want a cigarette that's milder.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"W<br />\n<br />\nWe use in Chesterfield Cigarettes<br />\nmild, ripe Domestic and Turkish tobaccos which have been aged and re-aged.<br />\nThese good tobaccos in Chesterfield<br />\nare used in the right proportions\u2014that's<br />\na very important matter.<br />\nThese good tobaccos in Chesterfield<br />\nare blended and cross-blended\u2014welded<br />\ntogether; that, too, helps to make a<br />\nmilder cigarette with better taste.<br />\n<br />\nTHEY'RE MILDER \u2014THEY TASTE BETTER<br />\n0 1933, LIGGETE & MYERS TOBACCO CO.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOME WOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., JANUARY 20, 1933.<br />\n<br />\nJ.

The performer, after<br />\nbeing locked into the can, pushes the lid upward<br />\nwith his head and the short inner lining is forced<br />\nout of place, permitting his escape.

Artificial flavoring can never wholly<br />\ndisguise the poor flavor ofcheap tobaccos.<br />\n<br />\nThe blending of several cheap, raw tobaccos cannot improve the flavor of any<br />\nof them. A fine cigarette is a cigarette<br />\nblended from costly, ripe tobaccos.<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nIt Is a fact, well known by leaf to.<br />\nbacco experts, that Camels are<br />\nmade from finer, MORE EXPENSIVE<br />\ntobaccos than any other popular brand.<br />\n<br />\nThis is why the Camel flavor has never<br />\nbeen rivaled... why Camels have given<br />\nmore pleasure to more people than any<br />\nother cigarette ever made.<br />\nIn more costly tobaccos lies the secret of<br />\nCamels' delicate \"bouquet\"...of their rich,<br />\ncool flavor\u2014of their non-irritating mildness.<br />\nIt's the tobacco that counts.<br />\nAll the natural goodness of Camel's tobacco is kept fresh and rich for you by the<br />\nair-tight, welded Humidor Pack.

In reality, however,<br />\nit is an important step forward and is a<br />\nsolution to a major problem which has<br />\nconfronted both new and old students each<br />\nOctober.<br />\nNo one can deny that no less than ten<br />\ndays are usually lost at the opening of<br />\nthe University because of the poor system of assigning students to classes. This<br />\nis valuable time lost to every student and<br />\nto every instructor. The solution to the<br />\nproblem, it seems, lies in the plans which<br />\nRyland N. Dempster, registrar, has been<br />\ninstrumental in promulgating.<br />\nIn the past, the registrar's office drew<br />\nup a schedule for all the classes given in<br />\nthe undergraduate departments, which<br />\nwas published in the catalog for each<br />\nschool. Usually the student knows, from<br />\nthe start, long before registration, what<br />\ncourses he must and wants to take. He<br />\nfills out his own schedule of hours, in<br />\nmost cases, and shows it to his advisor<br />\nwhen he is assigned to one on the day<br />\nof registration. The advisor, generally<br />\nokays it, after giving a good pretense of<br />\nbeing much concerned in the welfare of<br />\nthe undergraduate who is his advisee for<br />\nthe year.<br />\nWhat happens? The student reports to<br />\nclass. There he is either told he doesn't<br />\nbelong there for one or two of ten reasons, or he is told that he must report to<br />\nanother section of that class. That picture is a familiar one to all undergraduates. The student then chases to his advisor's office to report the matter and to<br />\nask to be straightened out at once. But<br />\nhe finds that his advisor is not in and<br />\ndoesn't make a practice of keeping office<br />\nhours. Several days pass by before he<br />\nfinds some means of straightening out the<br />\ndifficulty. In the meantime, actual class<br />\nwork has not begun, for the instructors<br />\nfind it is useless in the turmoil of sectioning courses, making changes, and trying to find more room for overcrowded<br />\nclasses.<br />\nThe solution to the situation was simple and yet no move was made until<br />\nthis year to put it into effect. All that<br />\nwas necessary was to schedule sections<br />\nfor each required freshman and sophomore class, especially, and to arrange the<br />\nhours of these sections in such a manner<br />\nin two groups of days\u2014Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Friday<br />\nand Saturday\u2014so that there would be no<br />\nconflicts in the student's required underclass courses. With two required courses<br />\nscheduled at the beginning of the week,<br />\neither in the morning or the afternoon,<br />\nfor example, and with two scheduled in<br />\nthe latter part of the week, the student<br />\ncould fit in the subjects he is supposed to<br />\ntake. The courses which most likely will<br />\nbe sectioned immediately by the registrar are English writing, mathematics,<br />\nFrench, English literature, German, biology, chemistry, physics, freshman and<br /><br />\nsophomore history.<br />\nUnder this new plan the student will<br /><br />\n\u2018\u2018<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nm working and Smoking overtime.,<br /><br />\nhence ait&amp;<br /><br />\nHEN I work hard, I usually<br />\nsmoke more; and when I smoke<br />\nmore,I usually work harder\u2014and that's<br />\nwhy I want a cigarette that's milder.\"<br /><br />\n\"W<br /><br />\nWe use in Chesterfield Cigarettes<br />\nmild, ripe Domestic and Turkish tobaccos which have been aged and re-aged.<br />\nThese good tobaccos in Chesterfield<br />\nare used in the right proportions\u2014that's<br />\na very important matter.<br />\nThese good tobaccos in Chesterfield<br />\nare blended and cross-blended\u2014welded<br />\ntogether; that, too, helps to make a<br />\nmilder cigarette with better taste.<br /><br />\nTHEY'RE MILDER \u2014THEY TASTE BETTER<br />\n0 1933, LIGGETE &amp; MYERS TOBACCO CO.<br /><br />\nHOME WOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., JANUARY 20, 1933.<br /><br />\nJ.

He invited persons of the audience to bring<br />\npadlocks and lock him into the can. He got into the<br />\ncan, the lid was put on and fastened with several<br />\npadlocks.

The performer, after<br />\nbeing locked into the can, pushes the lid upward<br />\nwith his head and the short inner lining is forced<br />\nout of place, permitting his escape.

Quality is the most important. Artificial flavoring can never wholly<br />\ndisguise the poor flavor ofcheap tobaccos.<br /><br />\nThe blending of several cheap, raw tobaccos cannot improve the flavor of any<br />\nof them. A fine cigarette is a cigarette<br />\nblended from costly, ripe tobaccos.<br />\n1<br /><br />\nIt Is a fact, well known by leaf to.<br />\nbacco experts, that Camels are<br />\nmade from finer, MORE EXPENSIVE<br />\ntobaccos than any other popular brand.<br /><br />\nThis is why the Camel flavor has never<br />\nbeen rivaled... why Camels have given<br />\nmore pleasure to more people than any<br />\nother cigarette ever made.<br />\nIn more costly tobaccos lies the secret of<br />\nCamels' delicate \"bouquet\"...of their rich,<br />\ncool flavor\u2014of their non-irritating mildness.<br />\nIt's the tobacco that counts.<br />\nAll the natural goodness of Camel's tobacco is kept fresh and rich for you by the<br />\nair-tight, welded Humidor Pack.
