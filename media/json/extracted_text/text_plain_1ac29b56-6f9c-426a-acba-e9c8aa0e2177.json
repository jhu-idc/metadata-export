Brent<br />\nKeyser, president of the board of<br />\ntrustees, said:<br />\n\"In every case in which the endowment and extension committee<br />\nhas made application for a contribution to its, funds it has presented<br />\nthe Hopkins need in an elaborately<br />\ndetailed form, and these statements<br />\nare now being carefully studied<br />\nby these specialists in philanthropy.<br />\nFor instance, in the School of Engineering a number of gentlemen<br />\nwho are indentified with some of<br />\nthe largest industries in the country<br />\nhave called in engineers to study<br />\nour proposition with them, just the<br />\nsame as they would do in case a<br />\nbusiness investment were offered.<br />\nAnd it is this very careful study of<br />\nphilanthropic enterprises which<br />\nassures the committee that an undertaking such as Johns Hopkins<br />\npresents will be accomplished. In<br />\nthe same way the School of Jurisprudence has been presented to a<br />\ngroup of gentlemen who are<br />\n!-Iiaking a careful study of the plan<br />\noutlined, which is thoroughly in<br />\nadvance of anything undertaken in<br />\nAmerica today.<br />\n. \"In soliciting the support of gentlemen who are in no way identified<br />\nwith Johns Hopkins or with Baltimore, three questions arise. The<br />\n* first question is, Why should they<br />\nbe created at Johns Hopkins?<br />\nSecondly, What is the condition of<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. And,<br />\nthirdly, What is Baltimore going<br />\nto do to help?<br />\n\"In regard to the first question it<br />\nhas been extremely gratifying to<br />\nfind that there is a genuine and<br />\nWidespread belief in the extreme efficiency of the local University. The<br />\nrecent reports of the Carnegie Foundation have been so careful to point<br />\nout the work of Johns Hopkins in<br />\nthe advancement of learning that<br />\nthe belief is general that we offer<br />\nsuperior facilities for the work<br />\nplanned. In answer to the second<br />\nquestion, it has been made clear<br />\nthat Johns Hopkins is in a perfectly<br />\nsound financial condition, and is<br />\nabout able to carry on its present<br />\nwork with its present means, but<br />\nnew needs are being created every<br />\nday and there must be trained men<br />\nwho are capable of solving the new<br />\nproblems as they arise, and it is for<br />\nJohns Hopkins to undertake to provide these men. It is on this point<br />\nthat the very careful study is being<br />\nmade by these specialists in philanthropy to whom our matter has<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., OCTOBER 10, 1910.<br />\n<br />\nbeen turned.

But no matter which method<br />\nof determining the courses a student is to pursue may be considered<br />\nbest by those who devote their time<br />\nto the study of such matters; no<br />\nmatter whether the choice of his<br />\nstudies is to be left to the student<br />\nhimself, or to be determined by the<br />\nFaculty of the institution, or to be<br />\nworked out under the control of an<br />\nadviser; however, in short, the matter is to be settled, we are strongly<br />\nopposed to letting that abominable<br />\ninvention known as the \"Schedule\"<br />\nintrude itself into the business and<br />\nnullify by its veto all the beautiful<br />\narrangements that may be contrived.<br />\nThe difficulty of conflicts, of<br />\ncourse, presents itself in every college at the opening of the session,<br />\nbut at few, if any, others does it<br />\npresent such an insurmountable<br />\ndifficulty to those who wish to avail<br />\nthemselves of their constitutional<br />\nprivilege of electing the courses<br />\n<br />\nthey are to follow, as at Hopkins.<br />\nThe reason is not far to seek.<br />\nAll the lectures and recitations<br />\nin the usual courses pursued by undergraduates are crammed into<br />\ntwenty hours a week, with the result that there are at any given hour<br />\nfrom eight to a dozen classes in session. The partial schedule published in the \"Collegiate Instruction\" pamphlet shows an average<br />\nof a little less than eight different<br />\nclasses for each hour from nine until one, five days a week. When the<br />\nlarge number of courses whose<br />\nhours are not included in this diagram is taken into consideration, it<br />\nmay seem how seriously the privilege of choosing his own electives<br />\nis abridged for the Hopkins undergraduate. Moreover, a single conflict is nearly always sufficient to<br />\nprevent a man from following the<br />\ncourse that contains it, and such<br />\nsingle conflicts are far more frequent than complete coincidence of<br />\nhours on the part of two courses.<br />\nThat the present schedule is an<br />\nexcellent one, in view of the difficulties involved in its arrangement,<br />\nwe have no doubt. The endless<br />\npains and care taken to make it<br />\nproduce the least trouble to the<br />\ngreatest number are to be commended. The difficulty is one that<br />\ncan only be overcome, in our judgment, by increasing the number of<br />\npossible lecture hours. Almost any<br />\nlittle freshwater college with onethird the number of courses given<br />\nhere would have thirty possible lecture hours a week. We realize that<br />\nto make a change in the same direction in our own collegiate department would rouse some opposition,<br />\nboth reasonable and otherwise; but<br />\nwe believe that the problem is sufficiently important to make some<br />\nsacrifices for a satisfactory solution<br />\nworth while.<br />\n<br />\nFALL CLOTHES!<br />\nWhy not a LEMMERT SUIT this time?<br />\nMade to measure from $18 up to $25, and hundreds<br />\nfrom which to choose.

When he signaled for the<br />\nball to be passed Woods, who had<br />\nbeen placed at center in McCabe's<br />\nplace, rolled it along the ground.<br />\nThe time was up a few minutes<br />\nlater.<br />\nDick McCabe played a great<br />\ngame at center until he was hurt,<br />\nand even then he was unwilling to<br />\nbe taken out. \"If\" he had been<br />\nallowed to finish the game, Hopkins might have won as Stonie always responds when his team is in<br />\na pinch. More players like McCabe<br />\nare badly needed in the line. Musser's tackling was one of the prettiest features of the game to anyone<br />\nwho understands football. Time<br />\nand again he broke through the<br />\nAggies line and downed the player<br />\nwith the ball. Shipley was the star<br />\nfor the Aggies. He is one of the<br />\nbest players the Agricultural College has ever turned out, and as a<br />\ngridiron general showed up most<br />\nfavorably.

I believe that a man<br />\nwho tries for the varsity and makes<br />\nthe scrubs, but plays hard on them<br />\nand serves as a buffer for the varsity men in their efforts to get experience and training, is just as<br />\nmuch a hero as the lucky man who<br />\nruns 70 yards and makes the winning score in the last two minutes<br />\nof a championship game.\"<br />\nDr. Magoffin spoke of the value<br />\nof football as a collegiate asset,<br />\nand scouted the idea that it should<br />\nbe abandoned on account of the injuries which have resulted in the<br />\npast few years.

Brent<br />\nKeyser, president of the board of<br />\ntrustees, said:<br />\n\"In every case in which the endowment and extension committee<br />\nhas made application for a contribution to its, funds it has presented<br />\nthe Hopkins need in an elaborately<br />\ndetailed form, and these statements<br />\nare now being carefully studied<br />\nby these specialists in philanthropy.<br />\nFor instance, in the School of Engineering a number of gentlemen<br />\nwho are indentified with some of<br />\nthe largest industries in the country<br />\nhave called in engineers to study<br />\nour proposition with them, just the<br />\nsame as they would do in case a<br />\nbusiness investment were offered.<br />\nAnd it is this very careful study of<br />\nphilanthropic enterprises which<br />\nassures the committee that an undertaking such as Johns Hopkins<br />\npresents will be accomplished. In<br />\nthe same way the School of Jurisprudence has been presented to a<br />\ngroup of gentlemen who are<br />\n!-Iiaking a careful study of the plan<br />\noutlined, which is thoroughly in<br />\nadvance of anything undertaken in<br />\nAmerica today.<br />\n. \"In soliciting the support of gentlemen who are in no way identified<br />\nwith Johns Hopkins or with Baltimore, three questions arise. The<br />\n* first question is, Why should they<br />\nbe created at Johns Hopkins?<br />\nSecondly, What is the condition of<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. And,<br />\nthirdly, What is Baltimore going<br />\nto do to help?<br />\n\"In regard to the first question it<br />\nhas been extremely gratifying to<br />\nfind that there is a genuine and<br />\nWidespread belief in the extreme efficiency of the local University. The<br />\nrecent reports of the Carnegie Foundation have been so careful to point<br />\nout the work of Johns Hopkins in<br />\nthe advancement of learning that<br />\nthe belief is general that we offer<br />\nsuperior facilities for the work<br />\nplanned. In answer to the second<br />\nquestion, it has been made clear<br />\nthat Johns Hopkins is in a perfectly<br />\nsound financial condition, and is<br />\nabout able to carry on its present<br />\nwork with its present means, but<br />\nnew needs are being created every<br />\nday and there must be trained men<br />\nwho are capable of solving the new<br />\nproblems as they arise, and it is for<br />\nJohns Hopkins to undertake to provide these men. It is on this point<br />\nthat the very careful study is being<br />\nmade by these specialists in philanthropy to whom our matter has<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., OCTOBER 10, 1910.<br /><br />\nbeen turned.

Marston, '13.<br />\nThe question of elective system<br />\nvs. rigid curriculum has engaged<br />\nthe attention of many famous<br />\neducators, some of whom have favored the one system and others the<br />\nother. But no matter which method<br />\nof determining the courses a student is to pursue may be considered<br />\nbest by those who devote their time<br />\nto the study of such matters; no<br />\nmatter whether the choice of his<br />\nstudies is to be left to the student<br />\nhimself, or to be determined by the<br />\nFaculty of the institution, or to be<br />\nworked out under the control of an<br />\nadviser; however, in short, the matter is to be settled, we are strongly<br />\nopposed to letting that abominable<br />\ninvention known as the \"Schedule\"<br />\nintrude itself into the business and<br />\nnullify by its veto all the beautiful<br />\narrangements that may be contrived.<br />\nThe difficulty of conflicts, of<br />\ncourse, presents itself in every college at the opening of the session,<br />\nbut at few, if any, others does it<br />\npresent such an insurmountable<br />\ndifficulty to those who wish to avail<br />\nthemselves of their constitutional<br />\nprivilege of electing the courses<br /><br />\nthey are to follow, as at Hopkins.<br />\nThe reason is not far to seek.<br />\nAll the lectures and recitations<br />\nin the usual courses pursued by undergraduates are crammed into<br />\ntwenty hours a week, with the result that there are at any given hour<br />\nfrom eight to a dozen classes in session. The partial schedule published in the \"Collegiate Instruction\" pamphlet shows an average<br />\nof a little less than eight different<br />\nclasses for each hour from nine until one, five days a week. When the<br />\nlarge number of courses whose<br />\nhours are not included in this diagram is taken into consideration, it<br />\nmay seem how seriously the privilege of choosing his own electives<br />\nis abridged for the Hopkins undergraduate. Moreover, a single conflict is nearly always sufficient to<br />\nprevent a man from following the<br />\ncourse that contains it, and such<br />\nsingle conflicts are far more frequent than complete coincidence of<br />\nhours on the part of two courses.<br />\nThat the present schedule is an<br />\nexcellent one, in view of the difficulties involved in its arrangement,<br />\nwe have no doubt. The endless<br />\npains and care taken to make it<br />\nproduce the least trouble to the<br />\ngreatest number are to be commended. The difficulty is one that<br />\ncan only be overcome, in our judgment, by increasing the number of<br />\npossible lecture hours. Almost any<br />\nlittle freshwater college with onethird the number of courses given<br />\nhere would have thirty possible lecture hours a week. We realize that<br />\nto make a change in the same direction in our own collegiate department would rouse some opposition,<br />\nboth reasonable and otherwise; but<br />\nwe believe that the problem is sufficiently important to make some<br />\nsacrifices for a satisfactory solution<br />\nworth while.<br /><br />\nFALL CLOTHES!<br />\nWhy not a LEMMERT SUIT this time?<br />\nMade to measure from $18 up to $25, and hundreds<br />\nfrom which to choose.

Bridgeman was<br />\nput in Riley's place in the back field<br />\nand he and Pieper alternated in<br />\ntearing through the Aggies in the<br />\nfourth quarter.

With<br />\nbut a few minutes left to play Hopkins again advanced the pigskin<br />\ndown the gridiron, and victory<br />\nseemed assured.

He did<br />\nnot say a word to anybody, and<br />\nnothing was said to him, but Referee Hunter penalized the Black<br />\nand Blue ten yards.

More players like McCabe<br />\nare badly needed in the line. Musser's tackling was one of the prettiest features of the game to anyone<br />\nwho understands football. Time<br />\nand again he broke through the<br />\nAggies line and downed the player<br />\nwith the ball. Shipley was the star<br />\nfor the Aggies.
