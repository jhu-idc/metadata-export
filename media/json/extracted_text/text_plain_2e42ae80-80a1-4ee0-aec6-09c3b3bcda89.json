It has been said -that<br />\nthe four years of college form the<br />\nperiod of life in which one gets<br />\nan opportunity to look out on the<br />\nworld in a broad sort of way\u2014to<br />\nsurvey life generally, looking over<br />\nthe whole field before plunging into one's life-work, necessarily a<br />\nnarrow channel of endeavor in<br />\nthis age of specialization. A college accomplishes its purpose<br />\nthrough many ways\u2014through its<br />\nstudies, through its campus associations, through its activities.<br />\nThere is another point of view<br />\nbesides. this selfish one. An endowed institution like ours, developed by the untiring zeal of seleCted men and containing a spirit<br />\nnearly half a century old, offers<br />\nmore than you can pay for. When<br />\nyou have paid your fee at entrance<br />\nthe account is not squared. You<br />\nstill owe a little spirit, a little<br />\nwork, a little participation in the<br />\nactivities of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThere are at Hopkins two distinct sets of men: those who engage in these so-called college activities and those who do not. The<br />\nformer class is much smaller numerically than the latter class.<br />\nLet us look closer at these<br />\ngroups. There are more positions<br />\n<br />\nof importance to be filled than<br />\nthere are men in the first class.<br />\nHence nearly every man in that<br />\nclass holds not one position of.importance, but three or four. It is<br />\nobvious that these men are overburdened with Work and responsibility and are therefore unable to<br />\n(rive their undivided attention to<br />\nany one of them.<br />\nThe larger class\u2014those not engaged\u2014meanwhile come selfishly<br />\nto college, take all they can in the<br />\nway of selfish benefits from Hopkins and then shirk quietly off<br />\ninto the city with the booty they<br />\nhave not really paid for. Little<br />\ncare they for the college activities, little care they for associating with their fellows. They are<br />\nstealing from, instead of adding<br />\nto, college life. For them there is<br />\nno excuse, and they deserve nothing but contempt.

We<br />\nhave heard alumni who graduated<br />\nin the \"nineties\" speak and inquire of him, but even they have<br />\nforgotten just when he first became connected with Johns Hopkins.

We<br />\nhave the dope on him at last. He<br />\nwas first employed in the physical<br />\nlaboratory, under Professor Rowland, 28 years ago. After remaining there for three years, he was<br />\ntransferred to the Modern Language Building.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nGeorge Deichman, '21.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD.,<br /><br />\nOCT. 21, 1919<br /><br />\nActivities.<br /><br />\nThe real purpose of a college<br />\ncareer is to learn how to influence men. It has been said -that<br />\nthe four years of college form the<br />\nperiod of life in which one gets<br />\nan opportunity to look out on the<br />\nworld in a broad sort of way\u2014to<br />\nsurvey life generally, looking over<br />\nthe whole field before plunging into one's life-work, necessarily a<br />\nnarrow channel of endeavor in<br />\nthis age of specialization. A college accomplishes its purpose<br />\nthrough many ways\u2014through its<br />\nstudies, through its campus associations, through its activities.<br />\nThere is another point of view<br />\nbesides. this selfish one. An endowed institution like ours, developed by the untiring zeal of seleCted men and containing a spirit<br />\nnearly half a century old, offers<br />\nmore than you can pay for. When<br />\nyou have paid your fee at entrance<br />\nthe account is not squared. You<br />\nstill owe a little spirit, a little<br />\nwork, a little participation in the<br />\nactivities of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThere are at Hopkins two distinct sets of men: those who engage in these so-called college activities and those who do not. The<br />\nformer class is much smaller numerically than the latter class.<br />\nLet us look closer at these<br />\ngroups. There are more positions<br /><br />\nof importance to be filled than<br />\nthere are men in the first class.<br />\nHence nearly every man in that<br />\nclass holds not one position of.importance, but three or four. It is<br />\nobvious that these men are overburdened with Work and responsibility and are therefore unable to<br />\n(rive their undivided attention to<br />\nany one of them.<br />\nThe larger class\u2014those not engaged\u2014meanwhile come selfishly<br />\nto college, take all they can in the<br />\nway of selfish benefits from Hopkins and then shirk quietly off<br />\ninto the city with the booty they<br />\nhave not really paid for. Little<br />\ncare they for the college activities, little care they for associating with their fellows. They are<br />\nstealing from, instead of adding<br />\nto, college life. For them there is<br />\nno excuse, and they deserve nothing but contempt. Their selfish<br />\nlack of interest, their selfish nonparticipation is a powerful detriment to Hopkins.<br />\nThe freshmen during their first<br />\nweeks of college have been deluged with opportunities to get<br />\ninto the activities around them.<br />\nHere is the same danger. Some<br />\nmay want to plunge into many of<br />\nthem, dabble in them all and, lead<br />\non by mere personal ambition,<br />\nspread out their talents over the<br />\nentire field. Others may be tempted. now to join the non-participants\u2014the college slackers.<br />\nThese men should stop now and<br />\nconsider. A little self-examination and introspection, then each<br />\nand every man should enter some<br />\none athletic, literary or other pursuit for which he is most fitted,<br />\nand then give it his undivided attention.<br />\nJohn Myers Long Connected With<br />\nHopkins.<br /><br />\nDoubtless many of us have wondered how long John Myers, our<br />\npostmaster, has been in the employment of the University. We<br />\nhave heard alumni who graduated<br />\nin the \"nineties\" speak and inquire of him, but even they have<br />\nforgotten just when he first became connected with Johns Hopkins. Were you to ask Mr. Myers<br />\nin the nicest way possible, you<br />\nwould probably be disappointed,<br />\nbecause this is one of his personal<br />\nsecrets which he never divulges.<br />\nIt is to be a secret no longer. We<br />\nhave the dope on him at last. He<br />\nwas first employed in the physical<br />\nlaboratory, under Professor Rowland, 28 years ago. After remaining there for three years, he was<br />\ntransferred to the Modern Language Building. He was made<br />\npostmaster in 1904.<br />\nMr. Myers has saved the University much money through his<br /><br />\nFRESHMEN PLAY TRUANT<br /><br />\nWILLOUGHBY AGAIN AT HOPKINS<br /><br />\nMany Absent From Roll Call \u2014 Sophomore \"Pep\" Committee on the<br />\nJob\u2014Student Council Will<br />\nEnforce Rules.<br /><br />\nProfessor of Political Science Returns<br />\nfrom Far East\u2014Was Constitutional<br />\nAdvisor to China\u2014Author of<br />\nMany Recent Articles.<br /><br />\nOn Saturday, October 18, at<br />\n2:45 P. M., the freshman rooters<br />\nwere again assembled On the<br />\nquadrangle in front of Gilman<br />\nHall. Here they were formed according to sections, after which<br />\nthe roll was called. Colonel Ellis<br />\nthen gave a short talk, in which<br />\nhe pointed out a few of the principal advantages to be derived<br />\nfrom joining the R. 0. T. C. This<br />\ntalk was preparatory to the R.<br />\n0. T. C. campaign, which will take<br />\nplace on Monday, October 20.<br />\nThe sophomore sergeants then<br />\nmade their reports, after which<br />\nmembers of the sophomore \"pep\"<br />\ncommittee inspected the ranks of<br />\nthe freshies. Only one man had<br />\nfailed to appear in the full freshman uniform, but an example was<br />\nmade of him in front of the company.<br />\nThe freshmen were then formed<br />\ninto squads and marched over -to<br />\nHomewood Field, halting on the<br />\nway only to have their pictures<br />\ntaken for this year's Hullabaloo.<br />\nAt the field they were given seats<br />\nin the rooters' section, where they<br />\nacquitted themselves nobly.<br />\nSergeant Cotton reports that<br />\nthere were 120 freshmen absent,<br />\nbut a few of these may have been<br />\nlate and failed to report to him<br />\nat the field. These names he has<br />\nhanded into the Student Conncilcil, but it is rumored unofficially that unless that body takes<br />\nmore stringent action this week<br />\nthan last, the sophomore \"pep\"<br />\ncommittee will take drastic action<br />\nto enforce the regulation requiring<br />\nall freshmen to be present at University games. . Indeed it is felt<br />\nby. some that many freshmen did<br />\nnot report because they thought<br />\nthat this regulation would remain<br />\nunenforced.<br /><br />\nProf. W. W. Willoughby is<br />\nagain with us after an absence of<br />\nthree years. During this period,<br />\na large part of his time was spent<br />\nin the Far East, and he made<br />\nthree trips to China and Japan.<br />\nProfessor Willoughby was constitutional adviser to the Republic<br />\nof China during 1916, and in recent years he has had an excellent<br />\nopportunity of getting intimately<br />\nacquainted with the state of political affairs in these oriental countries. Professor Willoughby, as a<br />\nresult of his wide experiences in<br />\nJapan and China, is now 'engaged<br />\nin the preparation of a volume<br />\ndealing with the rights of foreigners and of foreign nations in<br />\nChina, and he hopes to publish<br />\nthis book early in January.<br />\nHis field has not been limited<br />\nto the East, however, for in 1918<br />\nhis last published work, entitled<br />\n\"Prussian Political Philosophy,\"<br />\nappeared.<br />\nOne of the latest and most<br />\ntimely compositions of Professor<br />\nWilloughby is an article called<br />\n\"Japan's Political Ethics,\" which<br />\nappeared in the September (1919)<br />\nnumber of Asia. This article is<br />\nof unusual import, because it discuses intelligently the manner in<br />\nwhich China has been treated by<br />\nJapan during recent years, with<br />\nspecial consideration of the muchdiscussed 'Shantung situation.<br />\nBoth Professors Willoughby<br />\nand Lovejoy have been frequent<br />\ncontributors to the new weekly<br />\nmagazine, The Review, which was<br />\nrecently started by two former<br />\neditors of The Nation, i. e., Fabian<br />\nFranklin, formerly a professor in<br />\nthe Mathematical Department<br />\nhere, and Mr. H. de W.

The cost of<br />\nboard, lodging, clothing and books<br />\nis twice what it was a few years<br />\nago, and the number of students<br />\nin residence is greater.
