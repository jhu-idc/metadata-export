He is a dim-witted soul, who has never earned<br />\na penny in his life, and if he did would spend it on ivyleague clothes and his fraternity dues. He lacks the ability<br />\nto think, for that would put a damper on his fun-loving<br />\nnature. Consequently he has forced the young men desiring<br />\nto join his august group to swallow goldfish, eat raw liver,<br />\nscribble funny sayings on the walls of the Dean's house,<br />\nor to steal charters.

They will do<br />\nthe rest. But, versed in scientific<br />\nmethod, I realize it is necessary to first make assumptions<br />\nand hypotheses.<br />\nFor my initial assumption I<br />\ntake the findings of a team of<br />\nnine out of ten New York doctors who found that 20% of city<br />\nyouth stayed up all night playing chess, Poker, drop-thehanderchief and sundry other<br />\nnocturnal sports. What does this<br />\nhave to do with Hopkins? Well,<br />\n55% of the Hopkins students<br />\ncome from big cities and also<br />\nthe Russians are challenging us<br />\nin all these sports. So right off<br />\nwe have II% (20% of 55%)<br />\nstudying all night.<br />\nAnd then there is the Doppler effect, named after Clarence Doppler of Ohio State who<br />\nfor a whole semester studied<br />\nall night, slept solely at meals,<br />\nonly to discover after finals he<br />\nforgot to register. At Ohio state<br />\nthe Doppler effect was found td<br />\nbe 4% but since coeds comprise<br />\nabout half of the student body<br />\nthere, the percentage at Hopkins would be about 8%. The<br />\ntotal is now 19% of the Hopkins<br />\nmen who study all night.<br />\nNow of course the way to find<br />\nout how many students study<br />\nthrough the night is to circle the<br />\ndorms at about four o'clock in<br />\nthe morning and take a poll of<br />\nthe lighted rooms. But since 251<br />\nof the 337 rooms are doubles this<br />\nmeans that 74% of the students<br />\nhave roommates. Therefore, 74%<br />\nOf the 19% found studying all<br />\nnight so far keep their roommates awake. So this brings the<br />\ngrand total of Hopkins men<br />\nstudying all night to 33%.<br />\nNow to do my part for noble<br />\nJohnny Hopkins:<br />\nDear Dave, Bob and Nick,<br />\nI was struck dumb not long<br />\nago by the awesome fact that<br />\n33% of the students at John&<br />\nHopkins. ...<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, JANUARY 13, 1961<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n?AGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\nB&M<br />\nDELICATESSEN AND SANDWICH SHOP<br />\n301 EAST 31ST STREET, Cor. of Guilford Ave.<br />\nJUST ONE BLOCK FROM THE FRATERNITY HOUSES<br />\nTelephone No. CH. 3-9294<br />\n<br />\nFeaturing Fine Pizza Pies<br />\nTry Our Johns Hopkins Special Submarine<br />\n<br />\nTRY OUR COMPLETE LINE OF BEER<br />\n<br />\n(Author of\"I Was a Teen-age Dwarf\",\"The Many<br />\nLoves of Dobie Gillis\", etc.)<br />\n<br />\n1961: YEAR OF DECISION<br />\nWell sir, here we are in 1961, which shows every sign of being<br />\nquite a distinguished year. First off, it is the only year since<br />\n1951 which begins and ends with the Figure 1. Of course, when<br />\nit comes to Figure l.'s, 1961, though distinguished, can hardly<br />\ncompare with I911, which, most people agree, had not just two,<br />\nbut three Figure l's! This, I'll wager,is a record that will stand<br />\nfor at least two hundred years!<br />\n1911 was, incidentally, notable for many other things. It<br />\nwas,for example,the year in which the New York Giants played<br />\nthe Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series. As we all know,<br />\nthe New York Giants have since moved to San Francisco and<br />\nthe Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City.There is a movement<br />\nafoot at present to move Chicago to Phoenix\u2014the city, not the<br />\nbaseball team. Phoenix, in turn, would of course move to<br />\nChicago. It is felt that the change would be broadening for<br />\nresidents of both cities. Many Chicago folks,for example, have<br />\nnever seen an iguana. Many Phoenix folks, on the other hand,<br />\nhave never seen a frostbite.<br />\nThere are, of course, certain difficulties attending a municipal<br />\nshift of this size. For instance, to move Chicago you also have<br />\nto move Lake Michigan. This, in itself, presents no great problem, what with modern scientific advances like electronics and<br />\nthe French cuff. But if you will look at your map, you will find<br />\nthat Lake Michigan is connected to all the other Great Lakes,<br />\nwhich in turn are connected to the St. Lawrence Seaway, which<br />\n<br />\nHOW TO WIN A MASTER'S DEGREE<br />\nAFTER 10 YEARS AS A FRESHMAN<br />\n<br />\nillit<br />\n<br />\nThey've been enrolled at Capitol for 10 years now and<br />\nstill haven't become the Four Sophomores, but the<br />\nFour Freshmen's just-released album displays a degree of musical<br />\nmastery that's just about the smoothest and most danceable this<br />\nside of Commencement Day.In the style of the original\"Freshmen<br />\nSound,\" the boys sing and play their own backings to songs like<br />\n- Funny Valentine,Paper Moon,But Beautiful and Dream.

This would make our British allies<br />\nterribly cross, and I can't say as I blame them. I mean, put<br />\nyourself in their place. What if, for example, you were a British<br />\nworkingman who had been saving and scrimping all year for a<br />\nsummer holiday at Brighton Beach)and then when you got to<br />\nBrighton Beach there wasn't any ocean?

This, you may be sure, would not make you<br />\nNAO-minded I<br />\nI appeal most earnestly to the residents of Chicago and<br />\nPhoenix to reconsider. I know it's no bowl of cherries going<br />\nthrough life without ever seeing an iguana or a frostbite, but I<br />\nask you\u2014Chicagoans, Phoenicians\u2014is it too big a price to pay<br />\nfor preserving the unity of the free world? I am sure -that if<br />\nYOU search your hearts you will make the right decision, for<br />\nall of us\u2014whether we live in frostbitten Chicago,iguana-ridden<br />\nPhoenix,or narrow-lapelled New Haven\u2014are first and foremost<br />\nAmericans!<br />\nBut I digress.

How can there be new pleasure in Marlboros when<br />\nthat fine, flavorful blend, that clean easy draw filter, have not<br />\nbeen altered? The answer is simple: each time you light a<br />\nMarlboro, it is like the first time. The flavor is such that age<br />\ncannot wither nor custom stale. Marlboro never palls, never<br />\njades, never dwindles into dull routine. Each pack, each<br />\ncigarette, each puff, makes you glad all over again that you are<br />\na Marlboro smoker!<br />\nSo, Marlboros in hand, let us march confidently into 1961.<br />\nMay good fortune attend our ventures!

In Coach<br />\n<br />\nNEST<br />\nRecently Sports Illustrated published an article deploring the state of football at Hopkins. After being<br />\nquestioned by the News-Letter, Dean of the Homewood<br />\nSchools G. Wilson Shaffer expressed faculty opinion by<br />\nstating \"the whole thing was of no particular importance.\"<br />\nMany of the students could only bring themselves to say<br />\nthat the article didn't present the whole picture.

He is a dim-witted soul, who has never earned<br />\na penny in his life, and if he did would spend it on ivyleague clothes and his fraternity dues. He lacks the ability<br />\nto think, for that would put a damper on his fun-loving<br />\nnature. Consequently he has forced the young men desiring<br />\nto join his august group to swallow goldfish, eat raw liver,<br />\nscribble funny sayings on the walls of the Dean's house,<br />\nor to steal charters.

They will do<br />\nthe rest. But, versed in scientific<br />\nmethod, I realize it is necessary to first make assumptions<br />\nand hypotheses.<br />\nFor my initial assumption I<br />\ntake the findings of a team of<br />\nnine out of ten New York doctors who found that 20% of city<br />\nyouth stayed up all night playing chess, Poker, drop-thehanderchief and sundry other<br />\nnocturnal sports. What does this<br />\nhave to do with Hopkins? Well,<br />\n55% of the Hopkins students<br />\ncome from big cities and also<br />\nthe Russians are challenging us<br />\nin all these sports. So right off<br />\nwe have II% (20% of 55%)<br />\nstudying all night.<br />\nAnd then there is the Doppler effect, named after Clarence Doppler of Ohio State who<br />\nfor a whole semester studied<br />\nall night, slept solely at meals,<br />\nonly to discover after finals he<br />\nforgot to register. At Ohio state<br />\nthe Doppler effect was found td<br />\nbe 4% but since coeds comprise<br />\nabout half of the student body<br />\nthere, the percentage at Hopkins would be about 8%. The<br />\ntotal is now 19% of the Hopkins<br />\nmen who study all night.<br />\nNow of course the way to find<br />\nout how many students study<br />\nthrough the night is to circle the<br />\ndorms at about four o'clock in<br />\nthe morning and take a poll of<br />\nthe lighted rooms.

First off, it is the only year since<br />\n1951 which begins and ends with the Figure 1. Of course, when<br />\nit comes to Figure l.'s, 1961, though distinguished, can hardly<br />\ncompare with I911, which, most people agree, had not just two,<br />\nbut three Figure l's! This, I'll wager,is a record that will stand<br />\nfor at least two hundred years!<br />\n1911 was, incidentally, notable for many other things. It<br />\nwas,for example,the year in which the New York Giants played<br />\nthe Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series. As we all know,<br />\nthe New York Giants have since moved to San Francisco and<br />\nthe Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City.There is a movement<br />\nafoot at present to move Chicago to Phoenix\u2014the city, not the<br />\nbaseball team. Phoenix, in turn, would of course move to<br />\nChicago. It is felt that the change would be broadening for<br />\nresidents of both cities. Many Chicago folks,for example, have<br />\nnever seen an iguana. Many Phoenix folks, on the other hand,<br />\nhave never seen a frostbite.<br />\nThere are, of course, certain difficulties attending a municipal<br />\nshift of this size. For instance, to move Chicago you also have<br />\nto move Lake Michigan. This, in itself, presents no great problem, what with modern scientific advances like electronics and<br />\nthe French cuff. But if you will look at your map, you will find<br />\nthat Lake Michigan is connected to all the other Great Lakes,<br />\nwhich in turn are connected to the St. Lawrence Seaway, which<br /><br />\nHOW TO WIN A MASTER'S DEGREE<br />\nAFTER 10 YEARS AS A FRESHMAN<br /><br />\nillit<br /><br />\nThey've been enrolled at Capitol for 10 years now and<br />\nstill haven't become the Four Sophomores, but the<br />\nFour Freshmen's just-released album displays a degree of musical<br />\nmastery that's just about the smoothest and most danceable this<br />\nside of Commencement Day.In the style of the original\"Freshmen<br />\nSound,\" the boys sing and play their own backings to songs like<br />\n- Funny Valentine,Paper Moon,But Beautiful and Dream.

I know it's no bowl of cherries going<br />\nthrough life without ever seeing an iguana or a frostbite, but I<br />\nask you\u2014Chicagoans, Phoenicians\u2014is it too big a price to pay<br />\nfor preserving the unity of the free world? I am sure -that if<br />\nYOU search your hearts you will make the right decision, for<br />\nall of us\u2014whether we live in frostbitten Chicago,iguana-ridden<br />\nPhoenix,or narrow-lapelled New Haven\u2014are first and foremost<br />\nAmericans!<br />\nBut I digress.

How can there be new pleasure in Marlboros when<br />\nthat fine, flavorful blend, that clean easy draw filter, have not<br />\nbeen altered? The answer is simple: each time you light a<br />\nMarlboro, it is like the first time. The flavor is such that age<br />\ncannot wither nor custom stale. Marlboro never palls, never<br />\njades, never dwindles into dull routine. Each pack, each<br />\ncigarette, each puff, makes you glad all over again that you are<br />\na Marlboro smoker!<br />\nSo, Marlboros in hand, let us march confidently into 1961.<br />\nMay good fortune attend our ventures! May happiness reign!<br />\nMay Chicago and Phoenix soon recover from their disappointment and join our bright cavalcade into a brave tomorrow!.<br /><br />\n.L-LOVE\u2022<br /><br />\no LOVE<br /><br />\nLOST.
