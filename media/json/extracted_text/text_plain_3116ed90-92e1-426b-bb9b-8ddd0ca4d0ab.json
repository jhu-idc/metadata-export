Practically all of the athletes of note who were entered in the Georgetown meet, will be entered then and are on exhibition, our management points out, for half<br />\nthe price of the Washington meet. One of the greatest features will<br />\nbe probably the medley relay in which Booth will run as anchor man<br />\nfor the Black and Blue.
