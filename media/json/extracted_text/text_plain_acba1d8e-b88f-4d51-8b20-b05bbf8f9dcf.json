If the need arises for immediate action, the committee<br />\nmay be forced to first refer to<br />\nthe Council for approvco. This<br />\nloss of time could very well<br />\nrender negotiating sessions ineffectual. At the present time, it<br />\ndoes not appear that the Council<br />\nwill demand such close rapport<br />\nof the committee. But the power<br />\nis there none the loss, and one<br />\ndoes not construct a power structure upon the steps that those<br />\npresently in power will take. It<br />\nis quite possible that the antidiscrimination movement may<br />\nhave to operate into the next<br />\nschool year before obtaining results. Next year, there will be a<br />\nnew Council, and their opinions<br />\nconcerning the amount of control to be exercised step by step<br />\nover the committee in negotiations may change.<br />\nIf the Council is not going to<br />\ncontrol the committee, but will<br />\nallow it to act independently,<br />\nthen there is no reason --at this<br />\ncommittee need now be set up<br />\nunder the Council.

At the<br />\npresent time, I do not feel that<br />\nthe entire Council will do so.<br />\nThose of us who are personally,<br />\ninterested will; those who are<br />\nnot interested, will not. This is<br />\nbecause working in this movement is really a full time job,<br />\nbest left to those who started<br />\nit as a result of their enthusiasm<br />\nand willingness to work. The<br />\ncommittee will doubtless recognize this fact and allow the<br />\nfounders of the movement to<br />\ntake a leading role in the negotiations. To me, it appears that<br />\nthe committee can function well<br />\nenough without the burden of an<br />\nuninformed Council. If necessary, the Council would be able<br />\nto exert its influence by virtue<br />\nof the power invested in it by<br />\nthe Council Constitution whereby<br />\nthe Countil has authority over<br />\nall student activity. With this<br />\nlegal check in mind, it seems<br />\nsuperfluous to make the committee an integral part of the<br />\nCouncil, and there is a possibility that its efforts may be<br />\nhampered.<br />\nThe committee will serve the<br />\nvaluable function of concerning<br />\nstudent effort in a drive to end<br />\ndiscrimination. It will in all<br />\nprobability operate quite well,<br />\nand quite effectively.

If the need arises for immediate action, the committee<br />\nmay be forced to first refer to<br />\nthe Council for approvco. This<br />\nloss of time could very well<br />\nrender negotiating sessions ineffectual. At the present time, it<br />\ndoes not appear that the Council<br />\nwill demand such close rapport<br />\nof the committee. But the power<br />\nis there none the loss, and one<br />\ndoes not construct a power structure upon the steps that those<br />\npresently in power will take. It<br />\nis quite possible that the antidiscrimination movement may<br />\nhave to operate into the next<br />\nschool year before obtaining results. Next year, there will be a<br />\nnew Council, and their opinions<br />\nconcerning the amount of control to be exercised step by step<br />\nover the committee in negotiations may change.<br />\nIf the Council is not going to<br />\ncontrol the committee, but will<br />\nallow it to act independently,<br />\nthen there is no reason --at this<br />\ncommittee need now be set up<br />\nunder the Council.

At the<br />\npresent time, I do not feel that<br />\nthe entire Council will do so.<br />\nThose of us who are personally,<br />\ninterested will; those who are<br />\nnot interested, will not. This is<br />\nbecause working in this movement is really a full time job,<br />\nbest left to those who started<br />\nit as a result of their enthusiasm<br />\nand willingness to work. The<br />\ncommittee will doubtless recognize this fact and allow the<br />\nfounders of the movement to<br />\ntake a leading role in the negotiations. To me, it appears that<br />\nthe committee can function well<br />\nenough without the burden of an<br />\nuninformed Council. If necessary, the Council would be able<br />\nto exert its influence by virtue<br />\nof the power invested in it by<br />\nthe Council Constitution whereby<br />\nthe Countil has authority over<br />\nall student activity.
