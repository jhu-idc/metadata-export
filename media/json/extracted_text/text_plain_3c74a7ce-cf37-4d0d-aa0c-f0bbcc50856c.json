Now, however,<br />\nwe see the error of our ways. It is with an unmistakable feeling<br />\nof regret that we sever our connections with the NEWS-LETTER and<br />\nwith the men on its staff. From a more impersonal viewpoint it<br />\nis fortunate that our four years' fling at journalism, if we may<br />\ngive our activities a term of that dignity, has come .to a close.<br />\nWhatever contributions we may have had to offer have been long<br />\nsince made.

We are proud of our<br />\nsuccessors.<br />\nWe were once in the same boat ourselves, or imagined ourselves so. A year ago we were supremely confident that we could,<br />\nwrite, and our head literally teemed with policies and constructive<br />\nsuggestion.<br />\nEven the most rapid glance over the year's editorials has completely dispelled the first illusion; our constructive policy seems to<br />\nhave dwindled to incidental fault finding with nearly everything<br />\non the campus which came across our path.<br />\nIt is this which, on our positively last public appearance, worries us. We still contend that most of our criticisms were just;<br />\nand we even hope that they have done some good. But if we have<br />\nleft an impression that in scholastic standards, student affairs, or<br />\ngeneral spirit the university, is weak, we are sorry. Hopkins is<br />\nour university.

There are times when I forget to<br />\nbe critical, and become more facile clay than the most easily buffaloed of Bryn Mawr school-girls. ... Went to see \"Beau Geste\"<br />\nthe other night, a movie which, if I had held intact my pretense<br />\nof critical aloofness, I could never have been led to attend. Somehow, I needed to express sincerely my own shameful romanticism<br />\n\u2014so I went.<br />\nSuch pathos! An inexcusable piece of tragic and impossible<br />\nmelodrama\u2014if you are critical\u2014based on the remarkably sentimental affection of three brothers. If I, along with several other<br />\nmales and innumerable females, represent the mob, \"Beau Geste\"<br />\nwas a success. We had all wept in a varying degree when the<br />\nlights came on. Not much\u2014I wept far more copiously at \"Broken<br />\nBlossoms\"\u2014but enough to make the, chewing of a handkerchief<br />\nand the ruination of ten finger-nails necessary for the prevention<br />\nof audible sobs. And simply because two rather able movie actors<br />\npretended to die.<br />\nPersonally, I never made vows of eternal friendship and<br />\nloyalty with the friends of my infancy;\u2014our pursuits were of a<br />\nless mentionable nature\u2014nor have I ever heard of the consummation of such vows in real life; but the Geste brothers made them,<br />\nand what's more, kept 'em; remembered them in the very presence<br />\nof death. It is not, then, truth which the mob (and I) love. It is<br />\nalways the ideal rather than the real which wins the acclaim of<br />\nthe uncultured, and in many instances, may I note, of the cultured<br />\nas well. Michael Geste is no more a myth than Homer's brainchild, Achilles.<br />\nWhat soul is there, I wonder, even in the most critical of us,<br />\nwhich does not contain this absurd and divine love of things as<br />\nthey are not; of qualities far too fine for humanity to possess?<br />\nOnly the soul that knows no day-dreams. \"Beau Geste\" symbolizes, in a faintly maudlin fashion, it is true, this reaching for<br />\na moon of impossible radiance, this love of nonexistent characters<br />\ncut from the cloth that dreams are made of, this crying need of<br />\nevery man of a bolster for his conceit. Hero-worship,... idolatry<br />\n. . . what you will;\u2014there is a niche in the gallery of mankind's<br />\nidols which must be filled by the ideal man, the man dying the<br />\nideal death. If Cabell's definition is true, and if \"the signal function of art is to prevaricate beautifully about mankind,\" then \"Beau<br />\nGeste\" is art, because oh, how it prevaricates!<br />\n. . .

Now, however,<br />\nwe see the error of our ways. It is with an unmistakable feeling<br />\nof regret that we sever our connections with the NEWS-LETTER and<br />\nwith the men on its staff. From a more impersonal viewpoint it<br />\nis fortunate that our four years' fling at journalism, if we may<br />\ngive our activities a term of that dignity, has come .to a close.<br />\nWhatever contributions we may have had to offer have been long<br />\nsince made. In that light it is a pleasure to turn the reins over to<br />\nnew leaders, eager, optimistic, and capable. We are proud of our<br />\nsuccessors.<br />\nWe were once in the same boat ourselves, or imagined ourselves so. A year ago we were supremely confident that we could,<br />\nwrite, and our head literally teemed with policies and constructive<br />\nsuggestion.<br />\nEven the most rapid glance over the year's editorials has completely dispelled the first illusion; our constructive policy seems to<br />\nhave dwindled to incidental fault finding with nearly everything<br />\non the campus which came across our path.<br />\nIt is this which, on our positively last public appearance, worries us. We still contend that most of our criticisms were just;<br />\nand we even hope that they have done some good. But if we have<br />\nleft an impression that in scholastic standards, student affairs, or<br />\ngeneral spirit the university, is weak, we are sorry. Hopkins is<br />\nour university. Viewed from every angle we love it and we are<br />\nproud of it. We have pride in its past and present, and absolute<br />\nfaith in its future.<br /><br />\n.

There are times when I forget to<br />\nbe critical, and become more facile clay than the most easily buffaloed of Bryn Mawr school-girls. ... Went to see \"Beau Geste\"<br />\nthe other night, a movie which, if I had held intact my pretense<br />\nof critical aloofness, I could never have been led to attend. Somehow, I needed to express sincerely my own shameful romanticism<br />\n\u2014so I went.<br />\nSuch pathos! An inexcusable piece of tragic and impossible<br />\nmelodrama\u2014if you are critical\u2014based on the remarkably sentimental affection of three brothers. If I, along with several other<br />\nmales and innumerable females, represent the mob, \"Beau Geste\"<br />\nwas a success. We had all wept in a varying degree when the<br />\nlights came on. Not much\u2014I wept far more copiously at \"Broken<br />\nBlossoms\"\u2014but enough to make the, chewing of a handkerchief<br />\nand the ruination of ten finger-nails necessary for the prevention<br />\nof audible sobs. And simply because two rather able movie actors<br />\npretended to die.<br />\nPersonally, I never made vows of eternal friendship and<br />\nloyalty with the friends of my infancy;\u2014our pursuits were of a<br />\nless mentionable nature\u2014nor have I ever heard of the consummation of such vows in real life; but the Geste brothers made them,<br />\nand what's more, kept 'em; remembered them in the very presence<br />\nof death. It is not, then, truth which the mob (and I) love. It is<br />\nalways the ideal rather than the real which wins the acclaim of<br />\nthe uncultured, and in many instances, may I note, of the cultured<br />\nas well. Michael Geste is no more a myth than Homer's brainchild, Achilles.<br />\nWhat soul is there, I wonder, even in the most critical of us,<br />\nwhich does not contain this absurd and divine love of things as<br />\nthey are not; of qualities far too fine for humanity to possess?<br />\nOnly the soul that knows no day-dreams. \"Beau Geste\" symbolizes, in a faintly maudlin fashion, it is true, this reaching for<br />\na moon of impossible radiance, this love of nonexistent characters<br />\ncut from the cloth that dreams are made of, this crying need of<br />\nevery man of a bolster for his conceit. Hero-worship,... idolatry<br />\n. . . what you will;\u2014there is a niche in the gallery of mankind's<br />\nidols which must be filled by the ideal man, the man dying the<br />\nideal death. If Cabell's definition is true, and if \"the signal function of art is to prevaricate beautifully about mankind,\" then \"Beau<br />\nGeste\" is art, because oh, how it prevaricates!<br />\n. . . And, if it is excusable to express one's own romanticisms,<br />\nas well as to appreciate those of Percival Wrenn....<br />\nOft in the emptiness of night,<br />\nI lie awake and hear the breath of one<br />\nWho is not there;<br />\nSee dim the profile in the wisp of light,<br />\nAnd smell Spring's fragrance in the silken hair.<br />\nAnd while the heartless night roars onward in my ears<br />\nI murmur wordless passions to my soul<br />\nTake s-olace in the silencing of tears<br />\nAnd start\u2014and find there's no one there.<br />\nRIFLE TEAM DEFEATS<br />\nGEORGETOWN<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nA.
