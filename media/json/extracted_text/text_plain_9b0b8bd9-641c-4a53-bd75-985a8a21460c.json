Your<br />\nopinions would mean absolutely<br />\nnothing. You would just be<br />\nthere--you would be just a<br />\nstudent at the University who<br />\nwas upset with a decision. Since<br />\nyou would have no formal<br />\nchannels to express your opinion<br />\noutside of the News-Letter saying it's a bad idea and outside<br />\nof maybe protesting there<br />\nwouldn't be much formal communication. If you started any<br />\ntype of formal communications<br />\nyou would,in essence, be acting<br />\nout the rote of the Council as<br />\nit exists now.<br />\nN-L: Individual students have<br />\nbeen quite influential with the<br />\nadministration without being,<br />\nofficial Council members. If<br />\nyou had been as interested in<br />\nissues as a regular student as you<br />\nare as SC President, do you<br />\nthink that you would have had<br />\nany smaller effect on the administration?<br />\nSTEELE: I think that a student<br />\nby himself can go to a dean or<br />\nan administrator and say,<br />\n\"Listen, I have a problem with<br />\nthis and I think you should<br />\naddress it.\" And that administrator, nine times out of ten,<br />\nand this is not just Johns Hopkins but at all universities, will<br />\nsend him to someone else.. .And<br />\nthe student will go to that<br />\nperson, and basically what will<br />\nhappen is that you'll have a<br />\nshuffle-the-student thing going<br />\non. And the issue will drag on<br />\nso long that the student will<br />\nfinally say just forget it. Unless<br />\na student is able to muster the<br />\ntype of support that he needs to<br />\ngo in and see a dean, I would say<br />\nthat while his point will be<br />\nmade, I don't know how (here<br />\n'Steele paused for a moment) I<br />\ndon't want to give the impression that the student is ineffective. I mean a student is very<br />\neffective in any 'particular<br />\ninstance. But when you talk<br />\nabout a structure like the<br />\nStudent Council, you're talking<br />\nabout a structure that is able to<br />\nspeak not just for twenty-one<br />\n<br />\npeople, or not just for two<br />\npeople, but for three thousand<br />\npeople. You're talking about a<br />\nstructure that is respected. One<br />\nthing in any organization, whether you're high up or you're on<br />\nthe bottom, if the shit hits the<br />\nfan, you want to be able to go to<br />\none person or one body of<br />\npeople, a small group of people,<br />\nand discuss the problem and<br />\nwork out solutions with information from those people who<br />\nare known as your constituents.<br />\nWhen you have mass communication in the sense that you have<br />\ngroup A, group B, group C,<br />\nindividual one, individual two,<br />\nand so on, saying their opinion<br />\n<br />\nto one body, be it to the administration or whatever, nothing<br />\ngets done, nothing gets heard.<br />\nAll they're going to ask you to<br />\ndo is send them one representative to deal with, and that<br />\nrepresentative in effect becomes<br />\na president, or becomes a leader,<br />\nof the whole group because<br />\nthat's all they're going to deal<br />\nwith.<br />\nI can take it a little bit<br />\nfurther. Talking about how<br />\nuseful the Student Council is<br />\nin relation to student/administration, student/faculty issues-if we had no SC, we would have<br />\nno students on such committees<br />\nas the CUS. We would have no<br />\nstudents on such committees as<br />\nthe Ethics Board. We would not<br />\nhave a judicial code. We would<br />\nnot have the formal means of<br />\ncommunications in deciding policy. . A lot of the committees<br />\nwe have students on now, the<br />\nStudent Council fought to get<br />\nstudents on. We had to fight to<br />\nget the Education Committee<br />\nchairman on CUS. A lot of the<br />\nstudent privileges we now havebeing able to put on a fair, being<br />\nable to have student groups,<br />\nbeing able to petition the<br />\nadministration for money and<br />\nget it through the SAC--a lot of<br />\nthat stuff has been fought for.<br />\nStudent government has not<br />\nalways been the way it is now.<br />\nThere used to be less student<br />\ninvolvement; Student Council<br />\nwas more or less like a student<br />\nactivities type thing, where you<br />\nhad all the groups who got<br />\ntogether and did their little thing<br />\nand they were organized. It<br />\nwasn't until the sixties, as the<br />\nCouncil evolved, did it get into<br />\nstudent/faculty and student/administration policies and politics. It's not always been as it is<br />\n<br />\nnow. It took pressure and work is not Wednesday nights. SC is responds. We put out polls, and<br />\nand long hours and a lot of the long meetings the chairmen we put out questionnaires, and<br />\narguing and a lot of pushing and have with their committees, or you'd be surprised how many<br />\nshoving by students who were the committees have with deans students come up to me and say,<br />\nelected, student representatives, or administrators. The commit- \"I didn't know that was out.\"<br />\nto get the things that we've tees are the backbone of the And we put ads in the NewsLetter, and still students didn't<br />\ngotten.

And if you were comes up, decides how it should University, so we find whatever<br />\nto have it, you would get it go, not necessarily the Student means we can.

That's<br />\nCouncil, there would be a we vote in Council. . I don't your way of speaking unless you<br />\ncommunications gap. When I go think we voted on an issue all come up to a member directly<br />\nand say \"this is what I want\". .<br />\n.Some students just want to<br />\nexpress their opinion. You do<br />\nhave students who want to do<br />\nthat, but they don't take the<br />\nactive part of doing it. They<br />\nexpect us to just come out and<br />\nsit there on their lap and say,<br />\n\"O.K., what is it you want,<br />\nCharlie?\" And we just can't do<br />\nthat--we're only 21 for 2000. It<br />\njust doesn't work like that. If<br />\nyou want to know what the<br />\nheck's going on, you call up<br />\nyour Student Council president<br />\nor your SC representative and<br />\nyou say, \"Listen, this is how I<br />\nfeel about this, tell me something about it.\" Or if you see a<br />\npoll, fill it out and stick it back<br />\nin the box-it's there for a<br />\nreason, we don't print these<br />\nin and talk to the deans I tell year long without consulting things up just to be wasting<br />\npaper or to have a good time.<br />\nthem what the students want, with the student body.<br />\nwhat the students need, and N-L: The Student Council We do it because we want to<br />\nwhat the students are thinking... controls the $84,000 SAC bud- know what you think.<br />\nWhen Dean Owen put out his get.

The next<br />\npart of the program involves<br />\n<br />\nhelping students discover what<br />\nopportunities are available in the<br />\nfields in which they show interest.<br />\nOne of the program's goals<br />\nis to help an uncertain or unhappy student make an appropriate career choice.

According to Kimball, Anderson told<br />\nhim to look for other sources of<br />\nfunding, since the SAC would<br />\nprobably not fund the group.<br />\nDirector of Student Services<br />\nChris Colombo then told<br />\nKimball that it would be necessary to bring the proposal before<br />\nthe SAC Executive Board before<br />\nKimball could acquire funds<br />\nfrom any source. At the end of<br />\nJanuary, Anderson told Kimball<br />\nthat she would schedule a<br />\nhearing, but Kimball was never<br />\n<br />\nsubsequently notified.<br />\nIn response to Kimball's<br />\ncomplaint, Anderson said,\"During the first semester we set up<br />\nour priorities.

Taylor<br />\n<br />\nYou've heard that there's some place downtown<br />\nwhere those big cargo boats come in. But when you go<br />\nto Harborplace on Saturday afternoons, it's really<br />\npuzzling. Traffic must be slack because you don't see<br />\nany ships aside from the Constitution and a few paddle<br />\nboats. There are a few nautical trappings--the lifesavers<br />\nstrung along the railing, and the seagulls--but you expected to see at least a few weatherbeaten seamen buying<br />\nsouvenirs at the Embraceable Zoo or scarfing down<br />\noysters at Phillip's.<br />\nMaybe you shrug it off, denying that Baltimore<br />\nconsists of anything more than bars, a few stores, and<br />\nthe campus you are heading back to. But you could<br />\nhave adventured south, down past Hanover Street's<br />\nendless line of marble steps and Perma-stone, down past<br />\na small park where the man, sitting dejectedly on a bench<br />\nis actually a Maltese sea captain in search of a pay<br />\nphone to call home. You begin to see some Maritime<br />\ntaverns, places like the Dry Dock Inn, the French Quarter, and the Top Deck.<br />\nVinally you reach the water at the Port Covington piers. The wind blows, peppering your face with<br />\ncoal dust. Rusted metal warehouses, trapezoidal yards,<br />\nand rickety cranes suggest an old Mannix set. It is quiet.<br />\nYou walk out on the pier, and watch the Hellenic Valor,<br />\na sleek new freighter the size of Gilman quad, heading<br />\nacross the harbor.<br />\nYou drive slowly around the harbor's rim,<br />\nwatching the Hellenic Valor as it steams toward a dock.<br />\nYou reach Dtuidalk terminal. Time is money here in a big<br />\nway. Truck traffic moves quickly through the streets of<br />\nthis industrial town between 3200 Toyotas and walls of<br />\nstacked metal box containers that hold fur coats and air<br />\nconditioners. You wait to cross the street to the wharf<br />\n<br />\nleaning against the smooth white walls of a two-story vat<br />\nof molasses. Even though it's so flat down here that a<br />\nloose tire will roll forever on its own momentum, you<br />\ncan't see even a shadow of downtown Baltimore's<br />\nskyscrapers, only a 10-minute drive away. But that<br />\nother place might as well be a stage front city. Without<br />\nthe port, Baltimore would not exist.<br />\nThe port, whose founding in 1706 predates that<br />\nof the city by 23 years, now brings in $3 billion or 10<br />\npercent of the gross state product of Maryland. It is also<br />\nthe ultimate source of more than 170,000 jobs, one out<br />\nof every 10 in the state.<br />\nAs Hopkins comprises more than just one campus or facility, the port of Baltimore includes 13 terniinals stretching over a 45-mile shoreline. Some of these<br />\nare owned and operated by the Maryland Port Administration (MPA), a division of the state Department of<br />\nTransportation, others by private firms like Bethlehem<br />\nSteel. As landlord the MPA leases whole terminals or<br />\n<br />\ncertain storage space in them to private shipping companies.<br />\nThe Dundalk Marine Terminal is by far the<br />\nlargest of these, covering 550 acres and serving 50<br />\ntenants. Some of the other terminals--Locust Point,<br />\nClinton Street, and Hawkins Point--have also been<br />\n\"modernized;\" that is, they are adapted to handle large<br />\namounts of container freight in a hurry. Other terminals, like Port Covington and Canton, remain less needed<br />\nand are plagued by problems with maintenance, pilfering, and in the case of Canton, prostitution on the docks.<br />\nAt these lesser terminals ships lay up for repairs or to<br />\nload grain and coal--occasionally still using obsolete<br />\nloading gadgets which resemble burnt out roller coasters.<br />\nSeaman who land here are confronted with a hellish<br />\nlandscape.<br />\nAll terminals do not unload and store the same<br />\nkinds of freight. Dundalk specializes in container<br />\ncargo--big metal boxes which can be used interchangeably as truck trailers, train cars, and ship's cargo. It only<br />\ntakes a few hours to load or unload a container ship,and<br />\nships often come and go in a day at Dundalk. Other<br />\nkinds of cargo, usually referred to as \"bulk cargo,\"<br />\ninvolve everything from livestock to fresh fruit--one<br />\nterminal handles fruit only.<br />\nAside from the resources that a terminal needs<br />\nfor running its business and servicing its tenants(such as<br />\ncustoms officers, divers to recover sunken goods, maintenance and mechanics people, and the ever-present<br />\nlongshoremen), there are organizations in the city<br />\nworking in conjunction with the port authorities to help<br />\nforeign seamen find their bearings in Baltimore. Some<br />\nprovide for special needs, such as the Mission to Chinese<br />\nSeamen or the Norwegian Seamen's Church. There are<br />\nalso groups with religious backing that provide more<br />\ngeneral aid and information.<br />\nIn essence, the port is a nexus where elements of<br />\ncommerce and production, usually separated into their<br />\nown factories, offices, or countries, come together.<br />\nBetween terminal manager George Jones of Dundalk,for<br />\nexample, and first officer Antonio Logothetis of the<br />\nGreek ship Mariam, exist a myriad of people who each<br />\ndo their own jobs by their own rules for their own bosses. There are rules and boundaries set up to handle the<br />\nconstant interchange of seemingly unlike elements.

He pointed<br />\noverhead as he explained how they struggled on the<br />\nbridge deck until one fell off.<br />\nThere are four Latin American women on the<br />\nMariam, all of whom work in the mess hall. Logothetis is<br />\nimpressed with them. \"They are strong women,\" he<br />\nsays, making a fist, \"and they are able to handle the<br />\nwork well.\"<br />\nBecause everything is counted or measured at<br />\nsea,(hours, days,food, space, cargo), the ship's layout is<br />\nspare and clean. The linoleum hallways and unornamented gray-green walls all shine. In the officers' mess,<br />\nall the tables are set with pressed white tablecloths.<br />\nNaturally there is an economy of space that keeps the<br />\nvisitor aware of being aboard a ship, even though -the<br />\nfloors are as steady as if on land. Everyone on the ship<br />\nwears the same clothes\u2014most of them American-bought<br />\nbecause they're cheaper here-flannels, longjohris, and<br />\ncoveralls. The captain is indistinguishable from the deck<br />\nhands except for his age. Indeed, the uniformity of<br />\nclothing demonstrates the maxim \"form follows function.\" Everyone except for the mess duty works the<br />\nsame hours. Logothetis, second in command to the<br />\ncaptain, still must oversee the nuts-and-bolts work,from<br />\ngeneral safety to painting and scraping.<br />\nLogothetis has a large sitting room furnished<br />\nwith a banquet, table, desk, book shelves\u2014and Miss<br />\nJanuary, who hangs on her nail over the desk.<br />\nThe place has the look of a dorm room. It is,<br />\nafter all, a temporary living place. Seamen will sign a<br />\nwork contract for a period of months and then live off<br />\nthe money they make for several months before taking<br />\non work aboard another ship. Logothetis has worked for 13 months without a break and has a nine-month<br />\nvacation coming up. He plans to work only 6 months<br />\nnext time.<br />\n\"I am thinking (of) the summer. The summer is<br />\nvery beautiful for my country...All the Greek seamen<br />\nlike the family. Maybe they are going to many places,<br />\nmany countries, all the countries, but I prefer my<br />\ncountry.\" 'Logothetis looks forward to tir tint when he<br />\nwill tend his orchards,orchards, swim, and eat fresh<br />\nfruit during his nine-month hiatus. But as time passes<br />\naboard ship, he says he thinks only of his job and the<br />\nwork he must do the next day. Perhaps time hangs<br />\nheaviest on his hands now, as he is relaxing in his room<br />\nafter a few days of sightseeing around Charm City, not<br />\nknowing how soon he will be able to leave port.<br />\nDoes Logothetis admire the Baltimore renaisgothic splendor of our city? He shrugs. \"The<br />\nthe<br />\nsance,<br />\nseamen like bars and girls.\" Then he smiles.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 / MARCH 13, 1981<br />\nIMMIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIII11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111IIMIMINEIIIMMIIIMINIIMIIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIM11111111111111011111111111111111111111111111111111110111111MMINIMMENIMMIMMIMEMilliffillffilIMOINIIII<br />\n.<br />\n\"\u25aa<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u25aa\u2022\u2022\u25aa \u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n==<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT COUNCIL FILM SERIES<br />\n<br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series presents<br />\n<br />\nPRESENTS:<br />\n<br />\n\"NO NUKES knocks your M<br />\nsocks off.\"<br />\n\u2014 ROLLING STONE W.<br />\n=--.<br />\nOMI\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n=<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\nNP<br />\n==.<br />\n<br />\nTHE SEDUCTIONai<br />\nOFJOE TV/VAN<br />\n<br />\n=<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022-1111=<br />\n<br />\n=7.<br />\n<br />\n\"Carly Simon puts in a sensational<br />\nappearance.

Mockingbird, a novel<br />\nby the little-known Walter Tevis, author<br />\nof The Man Who Fell to Earth, is such a<br />\nwork. Very few books pack such an<br />\nemotional wallop; very few are so genuine<br />\nin their depiction of the human condition<br />\nand so powerful in their message. Mockingbird, a novel about a dystopian future<br />\nuncomfortably similar to our own time,is<br />\nvirtuosic, carrying the reader from one<br />\nemotional crescendo to the next. Undoubtedly,Mockingbird is one of the best<br />\nnovels of the past decade.<br />\nThematically,Mockingbird is similar to The Man Who Fell to Earth, but it<br />\nis dramatically different in quality and<br />\ndenouement. The Man Who Fell to Earth<br />\nis the story of an alien who comes to<br />\nEarth looking for a way to help his dying<br />\nworld but is instead consumed by the<br />\nmodern maelstrom of transient pleasures<br />\n(alcohol, television, money, and power).<br />\nThe story, though relevant, has been told<br />\nbefore. Mockingbird, on the other hand,<br />\ndisplays a deeper understanding of<br />\nalienation and is a more biting condemnation of our \"live-for-the-moment\" world.<br />\nThe scenario of Mockingbird is<br />\nmodern society in ultimate social and<br />\npsychological decay, each individual<br />\nliving in complete alienation from the rest<br />\nof humanity. Speaking is a rare event,<br />\nthe ideal of Privacy worshipped above all.<br />\nWhen something questionable occurs, a<br />\nmaxim drilled into every person from<br />\nchildhood springs to mind: \"Don't ask;<br />\nrelax.\" If someone feels upset, then he<br />\ntakes a handful of sopors (tranquilizers)<br />\n<br />\nto cleanse him of those annoying emotions which threaten to disturb his<br />\ndrug-induced complacency. Friendship<br />\ndoes not exist, and neither does love:<br />\n\"Quick sex is best,\" and cohabitation is a<br />\ncrime. Last of all, reading is a lost art, for<br />\nit breaks the law of Privacy by allowing a<br />\nview into someone else's thoughts.<br />\nThe time in which Mockingbird is set is<br />\nunknown, for history has vanished with<br />\nreading, and no one can remember much<br />\nof anything beyond the recent past due<br />\nto the universal drugged stupor.<br />\n<br />\nAuthor Walter Tevis<br />\nThe power of this image of the<br />\nfuture derives from its resemblance to our<br />\npresent. Since the advent of the \"Me<br />\nGeneration\" of the '70s we have been<br />\nretreating into self-indulgent, passing<br />\nhedonism, and the world of Mockingbird<br />\nis merely a logical extrapolation of this<br />\nattitude. The population in Tevis' future<br />\nis dwindling into oblivion, and human<br />\nbeings, hopelessly illiterate, their minds<br />\ndulled by drugs, cannot save themselves.<br />\nThe metaphor for this is the central<br />\nsetting of New York City-succumbing to<br />\nentropy, the machines break down,<br />\nthe repair machines malfunctioning and<br />\n<br />\nMondo Bongo<br />\n<br />\nIrish Rats Go Global<br />\nBY GEORGE YATCHISIN<br />\nAsk a hundred people on the<br />\nstreet who Simon Crowe is and you'll<br />\nprobably get no answers. Ask the same<br />\ngroup who the Boomtown Rats are and<br />\nmaybe you'll get a few replies. Well, the<br />\nRats are a former Irish pub band that<br />\nstands somewhere between rock and<br />\nprogressive rock, and Crowe is their<br />\ndrummer, the heartbeat that livens their<br />\nlatest album, Mondo Bongo. Bongo sees<br />\nthe Rats moving on; lead singer Bob<br />\nGeldof gives up trying to be Mick Jagger<br />\nand Crowe takes the place he deserves<br />\nin the group. For anybody interested in<br />\nrecords that can be both strange and<br />\nimpossible to sit still to, Mondo Bongo is<br />\nthe disc.<br />\nThe Rats have not given up their<br />\ngreat lyrical wit. Geldof still writes some<br />\nof the nastiest lyrics this side of Elvis<br />\nCostello. With Bongo the theme has gone<br />\nglobal; in many tunes the beat is often<br />\nAfrican or reggae, and the lyrics are<br />\ndominated by Third World themes.<br />\nClearly Bongo is an album of revolution,<br />\ncapturing both the fight and the repression. \"Go Man Go\" talks of \"danger<br />\ndays\" and \"mad Charlie,\" declaring,\"the<br />\nhelter skelter's free.\" \"Banana Republic\"<br />\nlaments that \"it's a pity nothing's<br />\nchanged.\" The fight goes on and on,<br />\nnothing solved,just like the characters in<br />\nthe Boomtown Rats' best previous tune,<br />\n\"Rat Trap.\" The only outlet for the<br />\nrebellion is the music.<br />\n<br />\nunable to fix even themselves, the city is<br />\nslowly dying, not with a bang but with a<br />\nwhimper. The parallel to the New York<br />\nCity of today is unmistakable.<br />\nWalter Tevis shows a greater<br />\ncraftsmanship in Mockingbird than was<br />\napparent in The Man Who Fell to Earth.<br />\nAlthough the story shifts perspective<br />\nfrequently, the narrative line remains<br />\nunsevered, and we do not lose touch with<br />\nany of the characters. Tevis' greatest<br />\nimprovement is his handling of characterization, which he executes with greater<br />\ndepth, believability, and force.<br />\nThe novel's protagonist, Paul, a<br />\nperson who has taught himself the lost<br />\ntalent of reading, is a truly dynamic<br />\ncharacter. His evolution from naivete to<br />\nmaturity, from just another stupored<br />\ncitizen of a dying world to the hope of<br />\nsalvation from the slow death of the<br />\nhuman race, is a believable and interesting<br />\nprogression. His growth from confusion<br />\nto definition transforms him into a free<br />\nthinker, an individual who stands above<br />\nthe rules and not in fear of them. The<br />\nmarker against which his character is<br />\nmeasured in his lover Mary Lou,who first<br />\nshows him the artificiality of rules and<br />\nthe bleakness of the world but is later<br />\nsurpassed by him in strength of character.<br />\nAbove all, Paul is a likeable character, and<br />\nthe reader empathizes with his struggle<br />\nand exults in the final triumph of man<br />\nover rules and life over death.<br />\nThe center of the action is<br />\nSpofforth, the ultimate robot who is<br />\nultimately alienated. Spofforth is lonely<br />\nto the worst possible extreme. Even<br />\nthough he is human in form and mind,<br />\nhe is segregated from humanity by his<br />\nasexual nature, which denies him even<br />\n<br />\n[/\u2018 ir 51<br />\n<br />\nThis is where Crowe enters the<br />\nscene. Previously Crowe had few moments to shine, with the exception of<br />\n\"Wind Chill Factor\" on The Fine Art of<br />\nSurfacing. Here, he is spotlighted on<br />\nthree cuts: \"Mood Mambo,\" \"Straight<br />\nUp,\" and \"Please Don't Go.\" His open-<br />\n<br />\nLSoomtown<br />\n<br />\nempty physical pleasures. The fact that<br />\nhe is a Make Nine robot, a model of<br />\nsuperintelligent robot of which only a<br />\nfew were made, sets him above and apart<br />\nfrom the rest of the robots. Most tragically, he is alienated from himself; his<br />\nmind, though copied from a human<br />\nmind, has had certain \"unnecessary\"<br />\nmemories deleted, and Spofforth is<br />\nhaunted by fragments of images which he<br />\ncannot grasp. His only wish is to die, but<br />\nhis programming prevents him from<br />\ncommitting suicide as long as there are<br />\nhumans alive to serve. Spofforth, denied<br />\na social identity or self-identity, is the<br />\nquintessential victim of solitude.<br />\nThe message of Mockingbird is<br />\nthat there are transcendent values which<br />\ncan only be understood through maturity. Quick sex, drugs, television, pessimism, religion, passivity, and apathy are<br />\nall cul-de-sacs. Only love, life, courage,<br />\ncompassion,and knowledge really matter.<br />\nTevis may appear to be a romantic on the<br />\nsurface, but his \"romanticism\" is not<br />\nbased on a starry-eyed perception of the<br />\nworld. The world of Mockingbird is<br />\nstartlingly realistic, and Tevis extracts his<br />\ntheme from this harsh, honest setting.<br />\nDespite its somberness, Mockingbird carries a positive message. Although<br />\nthe novel is realistic in tone, the protagonist is not ground into the dirt by the<br />\nheel of society as is the usual case in<br />\nrealistic fiction. Mockingbird asserts that<br />\nsociety, like its rules, is an artificial being<br />\nand can be overcome by the individual.<br />\nReading Mockingbird is like listening<br />\nto Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony-both<br />\nare melancholy in tone, but underlying<br />\neach is a chord of vitality, joi de vivre,<br />\nand hope.<br />\n<br />\nndo move on-from<br />\n<br />\ning on the last tune is downright spectacular, superhumanly quick yet precise to<br />\nthe second. It may be saying too much,<br />\nbut Crowe could be the Keith Moon of<br />\nthe '80s. He brings life even to the<br />\n<br />\nHun pubs to the intro won&<br />\n<br />\nsongs where he is not featured, and one is<br />\nforced to, listen to him-something true of<br />\nprecious few drummers today.<br />\nNevertheless, this Boomtown Rats<br />\nalbum more than any other makes one<br />\nfall into the whole song rather than focus<br />\nsolely on Geldors singing or a particular<br />\ninstrument. Solos are kept sparse and<br />\nshort; the guitars are negligible except as<br />\nrhythmic devices, and often the melody<br />\nis carried in the vocals only. Simply,the<br />\nalbum is a great group effort.<br />\n\"Go Man Go,\" which should be<br />\nthe single of the album, captures the<br />\nclassic Rats sound-somewhere between<br />\n\"Diamond Smiles\" and \"Wind Chill<br />\nFactor\"--and shows their supreme wit,<br />\nincluding a Mormon Tabernacle Choir<br />\nchorus singing oy-vey. It also features Dr.<br />\nDave McHale ripping through a perfect<br />\nsax break that makes the song.<br />\nThe next cut, \"Under Their<br />\nThumb,\" a cover of Richard's and<br />\nJagger's \"Under My Thumb,\" lays to rest<br />\nany notion that the Rats are merely a<br />\npunked-up mirror image of the Stones.<br />\nIt's a violent, speeded-up cover, with new<br />\nlyrics by Geldof, which he delivers like<br />\na paranoid on bennies. Keyboardist<br />\nJohnnie Fingers follows with an organ<br />\nsolo as tortured as Geldofs vocal, while<br />\nbassist Pete Briquette and Crowe throw<br />\nthe rhythm section into overdrive; the<br />\nend result can only be called intense.<br />\ncont. on p. 17<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 16 / MARCH 13, 1981<br />\n<br />\nThis Week's<br />\nCareer Advising Seminar:<br />\n<br />\nSOPHOMORES<br />\nAND<br />\nPsychology &<br />\nJUNIORS<br />\n<br />\nSocial Relations<br />\nTUESDAYMARCH17 4:00<br />\nin the L-VRoom<br />\n<br />\nEARN UP TO $850<br />\nPER MONTH WITH<br />\nTHE POSSIBILITY<br />\nOF A FULL<br />\nSCHOLARSHIP!<br />\n<br />\nSpeakers:<br />\n<br />\nThe Navy is seeking qualified sophomores<br />\nand juniors for the Nuclear Power Officer<br />\nCandidate Program.Applicants must be in<br />\npursuit of a bachelor's degree in the fields<br />\nof chemistry, physics, math and engineer\u2014<br />\ning.

The title, a violin duet<br />\nwhich the two instruments begin by<br />\nplaying different yet complementary<br />\nmelodies and after a great deal of variation end up in unison, parallels the plot<br />\nline of the story. Two individuals start<br />\noff in different places and relate their<br />\nshared experiences to a different audience<br />\nuntil fate brings them together. The form<br />\nis pre-eminent in this story.<br />\nThe second prize went to Joe<br />\nLevine for \"Pedigree.\" In it, a woman,<br />\nJess, watches The Black Stallion with<br />\nsome friends. Jess is moved because it<br />\nreminds her of her husband and the<br />\nrural life they shared.

When<br />\nseeking advice, she consults her dead<br />\ngrandmother (though we never witness<br />\nthese talks, she discusses them frequently,<br />\nand Herb becomes wary of grandmother<br />\nwatching him). Libby appears confident,<br />\nbut she finally breaks down and admits<br />\nher self-doubt and anxiety.<br />\nHerb realizes he needs this young<br />\nwoman to fill a void in his own life. She<br />\noffers him inspiration and a chance to<br />\nopenly demonstrate love. He ceases to<br />\nrationalize deserting his family, suffers his<br />\nquota of Jewish guilt, and is a better<br />\nman for the experience.<br />\nNeil Simon has been flirting with<br />\nserious topics since Plaza Suitte. After<br />\nsuccessive comedy hits, he watered down<br />\nhis comedies with hints of a thinking<br />\nplaywright.

I expect we'll<br />\nturn a lot more double plays.<br />\nAll in all, our defense and hitting<br />\nis much better than last year.<br />\nWe'll just be playing a different<br />\nkind of baseball.\"<br />\n\"Of course we lost a lot of<br />\nquality players,\" Babb says.<br />\n\"They can't be replaced, really.<br />\nThey were seniors who played<br />\nfour years.\"<br />\nBabb doesn't<br />\nexpect his freshmen players to<br />\nfill the shoes of those who<br />\ngraduated. Instead, he is evaluating the performers he has on<br />\nhand now, and is looking to the<br />\nfuture. In two recent scrimmages against Essex Community<br />\nCollege and Harford Community<br />\n<br />\nk.;ollege, Babb gave all his team<br />\nmembers an equal amount of<br />\nplaying time. Though Hopkins<br />\nlost both scrimmages, Babb<br />\nconsidered them very productive<br />\nbecause he could see just what<br />\neach player was able to do.

But they<br />\ncontinued to make sure that the<br />\nBaltimore Clippers who take the<br />\nice during the playoffs will be<br />\na new edition by sending away<br />\none familiar name and bringing<br />\nback another.<br />\nKim Spencer, one of the last<br />\nof the original '79 Clippers, was<br />\nassigned to Toledo of the<br />\nInternational Hockey League<br />\nlast week and was replaced<br />\nalmost immediately by Henry<br />\nTaylor, the Clippers' leading<br />\nscorer last season, whose playing time at Oklahoma City had<br />\nbecome limited due to the<br />\nreturn of several injured players.<br />\nHe will remain in Baltimore for<br />\nat least the coming week and<br />\npossibly through the playoffs.<br />\nThere was no doubt that<br />\nTaylor had been well remembered in Baltimore. The 3779<br />\nfans who witnessed his return to<br />\nthe city against Hampton gave<br />\nhim a standing ovation when his<br />\nname was announced at the start<br />\nand another one 51<br />\n/<br />\n2 minutes<br />\nlater, when he stole the puck<br />\nand scored to tie the game.<br />\nFrom then on it was all<br />\nClippers, as they outshot the<br />\nAces 23-4 in the first period and<br />\noutscored them 3-1. The final<br />\ntwo periods were little more<br />\nthan target practice in an 8-2<br />\nClipper romp; Hampton goalie<br />\nBob Parent was mercifully rem-<br />\n<br />\noved after allowing two cheap<br />\ngoals in one minute. Pete Hayek<br />\nwound up with a hat trick, and<br />\nTaylor and Glenn Kulyk chipped<br />\nin two goals apiece.<br />\nIt was a sharp contrast to a<br />\n3-3 tie between the same two<br />\nteams only the previous night.<br />\nTaylor believed that the Aces<br />\n\"didn't have much energy\" in<br />\nthe rematch.<br />\nThe Clippers kept their momentum with a 7-4 win at<br />\nRichmond Saturday, avenging an<br />\nembarrassing defeat at the hands<br />\nof the Rifles.<br />\nThe remainder of the Clipper schedule could have been<br />\nAfter<br />\nconsiderably kinder.<br />\nanother game against Hampton<br />\nlast night, the Clippers return<br />\nhome to host Richmond tonight<br />\nand Salem tomorrow. Then<br />\ncomes every coach's nightmarefour games in a row against the<br />\nrunaway league leader, the Erie<br />\nBlades. And that might not be<br />\nthe end of it; unless the Clippers<br />\ncan step off the conveyor<br />\nbelt and overtake Salem, they<br />\nwill open the playoffs in those<br />\nErie confines.<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nDixie Dick<br />\nTo The<br />\nescue Issue<br />\n<br />\nThe other co-captain, Mark Lipsitz, both sophomores.<br />\nBurrows, will play third base.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the Jays'<br />\nBoth team captains have three strongest punch will come from<br />\nyears' experience behind them their offense.

Lachance and<br />\nsophomore transfer student<br />\nRandy Greehan both played<br />\ntogether in a strong high school<br />\nprogram and are likely to make<br />\nthe transition to college play<br />\nvery easily.<br />\nBabb is still uncertain about<br />\nwho will start in the outfield.<br />\nWhitney Burke, who played<br />\nsecond base last year, will<br />\nprobably take right field. Freshman George Pillari is a likely<br />\nprospect for left. Center field<br />\nmay see Randy Greehan or Evan<br />\n<br />\nStromberg had 34 stolen bases<br />\non the year in 1980. Bruce<br />\nKane will bat third, seeking to<br />\nduplicate his 1980 batting average (.394). Mark Burrows, who<br />\nled the '80 squad in RBI's,<br />\nreturns to cleanup. The lineup<br />\nafter Burrows is still subject to<br />\nchange.<br />\nThe Jays will be playing<br />\ngames almost as frequently as<br />\nprofessionals during the month<br />\nof March. After the season<br />\nopened Tuesday at UMBC, they<br />\nplay Friday and Sunday at<br />\nhome, then travel to North<br />\nCarolina on an extended road<br />\ntrip, with games Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Then<br />\nthey return home for a double-<br />\n<br />\nheader that Saturday. Babb<br />\nsays, \"I know that's a lot of<br />\nbaseball in a short amount of<br />\ntime, but I hope it will give us<br />\nexperience for our league<br />\ngames.\"<br />\nBabb sees a few trouble<br />\nspots for the '81 squad, all of<br />\nwhich he believes will improve<br />\nby the time league play begins.<br />\n\"We still have no depth this year<br />\nin any position,\" he says. \"The<br />\nnew players have only replaced<br />\nthe departed seniors. Injuries<br />\ncould really hurt us this year.<br />\nStill, I think that if the pitchers<br />\nthrow strikes and don't walk<br />\nanybody, we'll win games.

It has<br />\nbeen eight hours since lunch and<br />\nso Haswell wastes no time in<br />\nborrowing the cone from the<br />\nsweet cherub's hands and starting to devour it. The response is<br />\nimmediate<br />\nand<br />\nexpected:<br />\nMadeline starts bawling, twelveyear-old brother Henry leaps at<br />\nHaswell, and soon three other<br />\nFranklin youngsters attack their<br />\neldest brother and knock him to<br />\nthe floor. So now a 200-pound<br />\nlummox, the first male in well<br />\nover a decade of Hopkins<br />\nathletics to letter in three varsity<br />\nsports in one year, is pinned on<br />\nhis back amidst screeching brothers and sisters.<br />\nLying on the floor on top of<br />\nmelting ice cream is a pretty<br />\nignoble position for someone<br />\nwho is supposed to be an athle:ic superman. But this is the<br />\nkey: it was unexpected. By his<br />\nown admission Franklin owes his<br />\nsuccess in football, wrestling and<br />\nlacrosse t-is year not to fleetness<br />\nof foot or greatness of bulk;<br />\nrather, it is \"the ability to<br />\nanticipate and expect, along<br />\nwith experience\" that has earned<br />\nhim success in his athletic<br />\nendeavors,<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the fundamentals<br />\nof shedding blockers, takedowns, and rides and clears are<br />\nwell understood by Franklin. \"I<br />\nfirst started organized athletics<br />\nwhen I was seven years old,\"<br />\nsays the 21-year-old sophomore.<br />\nin his three-letter status,<br />\nFranklin joins a club that has<br />\nhad only a few members in<br />\nmodern Blue Jay athletic hisThey are very few<br />\ntory.<br />\nand far between until 1957,<br />\nwhen former attorney general<br />\nBenjamin Civiletti lettered in<br />\nfootball, basketball and track.<br />\nFranklin must be honored to be<br />\nin such august company. \"To<br />\ntell you the truth, it's not<br />\nsomething I think about. It's<br />\nhard enough just living from<br />\npractice to practice, wondering<br />\nwhether I'll do well on a given<br />\nday.\"<br />\nAs to the inevitable question as to which sport he prefers<br />\nthe most, Franklin is very<br />\ndiplomatic. \"I like each for<br />\ndifferent reasons. Football is<br />\nfun because of the hard-hitting,<br />\ncontact environment. Wrestling<br />\nis enjoyable because of the<br />\nindividual competition. And I<br />\nlike lacrosse because of the fine<br />\nprograM we have here at Hopkins.\"<br />\nAre there any times when<br />\nathletics becomes a burden?<br />\n\"There are days when I've<br />\nscrewed up in practice or when<br />\n<br />\nthe bookwork starts to pile up,<br />\nand I truly wonder whether it's<br />\nworth it. But I guess when game<br />\nday comes, and with it, the thrill<br />\nof competition, all my doubts<br />\nare erased.\"<br />\n\"I guess basically I'm a competitive person; sports gives me the<br />\noutlet to satisfy my competitive<br />\nurge. And in athletics I like the<br />\nfeeling of working with teammates for a common, unselfish<br />\ngoal. In this aspect, I really<br />\nbelieve athletics is character<br />\nbuilding. And of course, 'in a<br />\nsound mind, a sound body.\"<br />\nAs Hopkins' academics have<br />\ntoughened, so has the quality of<br />\nvarsity athletic competition. So<br />\nobviously, someone who competes in this milieu must be<br />\nphysically gifted. Franklin is the<br />\nfirst to disagree. \"I'm not big or<br />\nfast. But I've tried to be a good<br />\nlearner and a hard worker. I've<br />\nbeen lucky to have had good<br />\ncoaching in my athletic experiences.\" Blue Jay coach Jerry<br />\nPfeiffer, who has guided Franklin in both football and lacrosse,<br />\nvoices<br />\ncomments.<br />\nsimilar<br />\n\"Haswell is a smart, heady ball<br />\nplayer. Often, he has been able<br />\nto anticipate an opponent's<br />\nmoves on the basis of his experience.

The Student<br />\nCouncil and other students have<br />\ntalked with the architects, but<br />\naltogether, the number of students who have been involved<br />\nmay be no more than 50.<br />\nJakie Hall and others don't<br />\nfeel that students have been left<br />\nout of the process and are not<br />\naverse to student input now.<br />\nEven it the Trustees approve the<br />\npresent proposal, there will be<br />\nenough leeway to change some<br />\naspects of the plan.<br />\nFor the purpose of eliciting<br />\nstudent interest in the proposal,<br />\na questionnaire has been put<br />\non page 3. The results of this<br />\nquestionnaire may be helpful in<br /><br />\norganizing an open meeting,<br />\nwhere the architects present the<br />\nplans and then address the<br />\nspecific concerns and interests of<br />\nstudents.<br />\nPlease read the article explaining the plans and fill out<br />\nthe questionnaire. There is no<br />\nguarantee that your ideas and<br />\nconcerns will be dealt with to<br />\nyour satisfaction, but they may<br />\nnot be dealt with at all if you<br />\ndon't express them.

Second, are we<br />\nreverting to a kind of late-sixties liberalism,<br />\nfeigning awareness, but actually accomplishing nothing?<br />\nWe'd like to think that the new awareness is more than just a passing reaction to<br />\nchest-thumping statements from Mr. Haig<br />\nand increased military advertising in the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nReal political interest involves commitment on a deeper level.

Your<br />\nopinions would mean absolutely<br />\nnothing. You would just be<br />\nthere--you would be just a<br />\nstudent at the University who<br />\nwas upset with a decision. Since<br />\nyou would have no formal<br />\nchannels to express your opinion<br />\noutside of the News-Letter saying it's a bad idea and outside<br />\nof maybe protesting there<br />\nwouldn't be much formal communication. If you started any<br />\ntype of formal communications<br />\nyou would,in essence, be acting<br />\nout the rote of the Council as<br />\nit exists now.<br />\nN-L: Individual students have<br />\nbeen quite influential with the<br />\nadministration without being,<br />\nofficial Council members. If<br />\nyou had been as interested in<br />\nissues as a regular student as you<br />\nare as SC President, do you<br />\nthink that you would have had<br />\nany smaller effect on the administration?<br />\nSTEELE: I think that a student<br />\nby himself can go to a dean or<br />\nan administrator and say,<br />\n\"Listen, I have a problem with<br />\nthis and I think you should<br />\naddress it.\" And that administrator, nine times out of ten,<br />\nand this is not just Johns Hopkins but at all universities, will<br />\nsend him to someone else.. .And<br />\nthe student will go to that<br />\nperson, and basically what will<br />\nhappen is that you'll have a<br />\nshuffle-the-student thing going<br />\non. And the issue will drag on<br />\nso long that the student will<br />\nfinally say just forget it. Unless<br />\na student is able to muster the<br />\ntype of support that he needs to<br />\ngo in and see a dean, I would say<br />\nthat while his point will be<br />\nmade, I don't know how (here<br />\n'Steele paused for a moment) I<br />\ndon't want to give the impression that the student is ineffective. I mean a student is very<br />\neffective in any 'particular<br />\ninstance. But when you talk<br />\nabout a structure like the<br />\nStudent Council, you're talking<br />\nabout a structure that is able to<br />\nspeak not just for twenty-one<br /><br />\npeople, or not just for two<br />\npeople, but for three thousand<br />\npeople. You're talking about a<br />\nstructure that is respected. One<br />\nthing in any organization, whether you're high up or you're on<br />\nthe bottom, if the shit hits the<br />\nfan, you want to be able to go to<br />\none person or one body of<br />\npeople, a small group of people,<br />\nand discuss the problem and<br />\nwork out solutions with information from those people who<br />\nare known as your constituents.<br />\nWhen you have mass communication in the sense that you have<br />\ngroup A, group B, group C,<br />\nindividual one, individual two,<br />\nand so on, saying their opinion<br /><br />\nto one body, be it to the administration or whatever, nothing<br />\ngets done, nothing gets heard.<br />\nAll they're going to ask you to<br />\ndo is send them one representative to deal with, and that<br />\nrepresentative in effect becomes<br />\na president, or becomes a leader,<br />\nof the whole group because<br />\nthat's all they're going to deal<br />\nwith.<br />\nI can take it a little bit<br />\nfurther. Talking about how<br />\nuseful the Student Council is<br />\nin relation to student/administration, student/faculty issues-if we had no SC, we would have<br />\nno students on such committees<br />\nas the CUS. We would have no<br />\nstudents on such committees as<br />\nthe Ethics Board. We would not<br />\nhave a judicial code. We would<br />\nnot have the formal means of<br />\ncommunications in deciding policy. . A lot of the committees<br />\nwe have students on now, the<br />\nStudent Council fought to get<br />\nstudents on. We had to fight to<br />\nget the Education Committee<br />\nchairman on CUS. A lot of the<br />\nstudent privileges we now havebeing able to put on a fair, being<br />\nable to have student groups,<br />\nbeing able to petition the<br />\nadministration for money and<br />\nget it through the SAC--a lot of<br />\nthat stuff has been fought for.<br />\nStudent government has not<br />\nalways been the way it is now.<br />\nThere used to be less student<br />\ninvolvement; Student Council<br />\nwas more or less like a student<br />\nactivities type thing, where you<br />\nhad all the groups who got<br />\ntogether and did their little thing<br />\nand they were organized. It<br />\nwasn't until the sixties, as the<br />\nCouncil evolved, did it get into<br />\nstudent/faculty and student/administration policies and politics. It's not always been as it is<br /><br />\nnow. It took pressure and work is not Wednesday nights. SC is responds. We put out polls, and<br />\nand long hours and a lot of the long meetings the chairmen we put out questionnaires, and<br />\narguing and a lot of pushing and have with their committees, or you'd be surprised how many<br />\nshoving by students who were the committees have with deans students come up to me and say,<br />\nelected, student representatives, or administrators. The commit- \"I didn't know that was out.\"<br />\nto get the things that we've tees are the backbone of the And we put ads in the NewsLetter, and still students didn't<br />\ngotten.

And if you were comes up, decides how it should University, so we find whatever<br />\nto have it, you would get it go, not necessarily the Student means we can.

That's<br />\nCouncil, there would be a we vote in Council. . I don't your way of speaking unless you<br />\ncommunications gap. When I go think we voted on an issue all come up to a member directly<br />\nand say \"this is what I want\". .<br />\n.Some students just want to<br />\nexpress their opinion. You do<br />\nhave students who want to do<br />\nthat, but they don't take the<br />\nactive part of doing it. They<br />\nexpect us to just come out and<br />\nsit there on their lap and say,<br />\n\"O.K., what is it you want,<br />\nCharlie?\" And we just can't do<br />\nthat--we're only 21 for 2000. It<br />\njust doesn't work like that. If<br />\nyou want to know what the<br />\nheck's going on, you call up<br />\nyour Student Council president<br />\nor your SC representative and<br />\nyou say, \"Listen, this is how I<br />\nfeel about this, tell me something about it.\" Or if you see a<br />\npoll, fill it out and stick it back<br />\nin the box-it's there for a<br />\nreason, we don't print these<br />\nin and talk to the deans I tell year long without consulting things up just to be wasting<br />\npaper or to have a good time.<br />\nthem what the students want, with the student body.<br />\nwhat the students need, and N-L: The Student Council We do it because we want to<br />\nwhat the students are thinking... controls the $84,000 SAC bud- know what you think.<br />\nWhen Dean Owen put out his get.

Under the Board's constitutional power, a hearing<br />\npanel of five committeemen is<br />\nselected to assess all testimony<br />\nfrom the students and faculty<br />\nThen the panel<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nrenders a decision, with four<br />\nguilty votes required to authorize punitive action. Possible<br />\npenalties range from failing the<br />\ntest or course to expulsion from<br />\nthe University.

Run by Dr. Lee Richmond, a counsellor with the<br />\nEvening College, and Dr.<br />\nAndrew Goldfinger, a physicist<br />\nwith the Applied Physics Laboratory, the group will meet<br /><br />\nWednesdays for five weeks to<br />\nteach students how to make<br />\ncareer choices.<br />\nDuring the first weeks, the<br />\nstudents will take \"interest inventory\" and \"motivation indicator\" tests. These will be used<br />\nas guides to help students find<br />\nout about themselves, and where<br />\ntheir true interests lie. The next<br />\npart of the program involves<br /><br />\nhelping students discover what<br />\nopportunities are available in the<br />\nfields in which they show interest.<br />\nOne of the program's goals<br />\nis to help an uncertain or unhappy student make an appropriate career choice.

According to Kimball, Anderson told<br />\nhim to look for other sources of<br />\nfunding, since the SAC would<br />\nprobably not fund the group.<br />\nDirector of Student Services<br />\nChris Colombo then told<br />\nKimball that it would be necessary to bring the proposal before<br />\nthe SAC Executive Board before<br />\nKimball could acquire funds<br />\nfrom any source. At the end of<br />\nJanuary, Anderson told Kimball<br />\nthat she would schedule a<br />\nhearing, but Kimball was never<br /><br />\nsubsequently notified.<br />\nIn response to Kimball's<br />\ncomplaint, Anderson said,\"During the first semester we set up<br />\nour priorities.

Taylor<br /><br />\nYou've heard that there's some place downtown<br />\nwhere those big cargo boats come in. But when you go<br />\nto Harborplace on Saturday afternoons, it's really<br />\npuzzling. Traffic must be slack because you don't see<br />\nany ships aside from the Constitution and a few paddle<br />\nboats. There are a few nautical trappings--the lifesavers<br />\nstrung along the railing, and the seagulls--but you expected to see at least a few weatherbeaten seamen buying<br />\nsouvenirs at the Embraceable Zoo or scarfing down<br />\noysters at Phillip's.<br />\nMaybe you shrug it off, denying that Baltimore<br />\nconsists of anything more than bars, a few stores, and<br />\nthe campus you are heading back to. But you could<br />\nhave adventured south, down past Hanover Street's<br />\nendless line of marble steps and Perma-stone, down past<br />\na small park where the man, sitting dejectedly on a bench<br />\nis actually a Maltese sea captain in search of a pay<br />\nphone to call home. You begin to see some Maritime<br />\ntaverns, places like the Dry Dock Inn, the French Quarter, and the Top Deck.<br />\nVinally you reach the water at the Port Covington piers. The wind blows, peppering your face with<br />\ncoal dust. Rusted metal warehouses, trapezoidal yards,<br />\nand rickety cranes suggest an old Mannix set. It is quiet.<br />\nYou walk out on the pier, and watch the Hellenic Valor,<br />\na sleek new freighter the size of Gilman quad, heading<br />\nacross the harbor.<br />\nYou drive slowly around the harbor's rim,<br />\nwatching the Hellenic Valor as it steams toward a dock.<br />\nYou reach Dtuidalk terminal. Time is money here in a big<br />\nway. Truck traffic moves quickly through the streets of<br />\nthis industrial town between 3200 Toyotas and walls of<br />\nstacked metal box containers that hold fur coats and air<br />\nconditioners. You wait to cross the street to the wharf<br /><br />\nleaning against the smooth white walls of a two-story vat<br />\nof molasses. Even though it's so flat down here that a<br />\nloose tire will roll forever on its own momentum, you<br />\ncan't see even a shadow of downtown Baltimore's<br />\nskyscrapers, only a 10-minute drive away. But that<br />\nother place might as well be a stage front city. Without<br />\nthe port, Baltimore would not exist.<br />\nThe port, whose founding in 1706 predates that<br />\nof the city by 23 years, now brings in $3 billion or 10<br />\npercent of the gross state product of Maryland. It is also<br />\nthe ultimate source of more than 170,000 jobs, one out<br />\nof every 10 in the state.<br />\nAs Hopkins comprises more than just one campus or facility, the port of Baltimore includes 13 terniinals stretching over a 45-mile shoreline. Some of these<br />\nare owned and operated by the Maryland Port Administration (MPA), a division of the state Department of<br />\nTransportation, others by private firms like Bethlehem<br />\nSteel. As landlord the MPA leases whole terminals or<br /><br />\ncertain storage space in them to private shipping companies.<br />\nThe Dundalk Marine Terminal is by far the<br />\nlargest of these, covering 550 acres and serving 50<br />\ntenants. Some of the other terminals--Locust Point,<br />\nClinton Street, and Hawkins Point--have also been<br />\n\"modernized;\" that is, they are adapted to handle large<br />\namounts of container freight in a hurry. Other terminals, like Port Covington and Canton, remain less needed<br />\nand are plagued by problems with maintenance, pilfering, and in the case of Canton, prostitution on the docks.<br />\nAt these lesser terminals ships lay up for repairs or to<br />\nload grain and coal--occasionally still using obsolete<br />\nloading gadgets which resemble burnt out roller coasters.<br />\nSeaman who land here are confronted with a hellish<br />\nlandscape.<br />\nAll terminals do not unload and store the same<br />\nkinds of freight. Dundalk specializes in container<br />\ncargo--big metal boxes which can be used interchangeably as truck trailers, train cars, and ship's cargo. It only<br />\ntakes a few hours to load or unload a container ship,and<br />\nships often come and go in a day at Dundalk. Other<br />\nkinds of cargo, usually referred to as \"bulk cargo,\"<br />\ninvolve everything from livestock to fresh fruit--one<br />\nterminal handles fruit only.<br />\nAside from the resources that a terminal needs<br />\nfor running its business and servicing its tenants(such as<br />\ncustoms officers, divers to recover sunken goods, maintenance and mechanics people, and the ever-present<br />\nlongshoremen), there are organizations in the city<br />\nworking in conjunction with the port authorities to help<br />\nforeign seamen find their bearings in Baltimore. Some<br />\nprovide for special needs, such as the Mission to Chinese<br />\nSeamen or the Norwegian Seamen's Church. There are<br />\nalso groups with religious backing that provide more<br />\ngeneral aid and information.<br />\nIn essence, the port is a nexus where elements of<br />\ncommerce and production, usually separated into their<br />\nown factories, offices, or countries, come together.<br />\nBetween terminal manager George Jones of Dundalk,for<br />\nexample, and first officer Antonio Logothetis of the<br />\nGreek ship Mariam, exist a myriad of people who each<br />\ndo their own jobs by their own rules for their own bosses. There are rules and boundaries set up to handle the<br />\nconstant interchange of seemingly unlike elements.

When he comes<br />\ninto Baltimore he goes straight to Greek-town and later,<br />\nto the zoo, where he takes pictures to add to an extensive collection. It is hard for him to separate Baltimore<br />\nas a port from other ports; the American ports, he says,<br />\nare not much different from their Western European<br />\ncounterparts.<br />\nWhat he does see as different is the economy<br />\nhere: \"everyone works. In other countries there is a<br />\nproblem with work. Sometimes you'd pray for work.\"<br />\nWhen he started in 1961, he couldn't afford shoes and<br />\ndeath from starvation was a problem on his native island<br />\nin the Aegean Sea. His father was a seaman, so at 19,<br />\nLogothetis also turned to the sea to make a living for<br />\nhis family; his first wages were $30 a month. Logothetis<br />\nsays that young Greeks no longer go to the sea. \"Now<br />\nthey go to the universities, now they become engineers,\"<br />\nhe explains a bit remorsefully. \"I'd go that way too if!<br />\nwas starting out today.\"<br />\nThe 32-man crew of the Mariam consists mainly<br />\nof Indians, Filipinos, and South Americans, all seeking<br />\nrelief from economic hardships at home, as Logothetis<br />\nonce was. Though he feels a bond of common experience with these people, he cannot know \"how they<br />\nthink.\" Sometimes, during the conflicts that come up,<br />\nhe has to keep stability, breaking up fights and dismissing rowdies at the next port. On deck Logothetis' eyes<br />\ntake in the whole ship's activities in one sharp glance.<br />\nThere are only a few crew members dotting the expanse<br />\nof rusted deck, carrying coils or adjusting valves.<br />\nLogothetits tells of a fight he broke up on<br />\nboard. One of the men had a knife, he said. He pointed<br />\noverhead as he explained how they struggled on the<br />\nbridge deck until one fell off.<br />\nThere are four Latin American women on the<br />\nMariam, all of whom work in the mess hall. Logothetis is<br />\nimpressed with them. \"They are strong women,\" he<br />\nsays, making a fist, \"and they are able to handle the<br />\nwork well.\"<br />\nBecause everything is counted or measured at<br />\nsea,(hours, days,food, space, cargo), the ship's layout is<br />\nspare and clean. The linoleum hallways and unornamented gray-green walls all shine. In the officers' mess,<br />\nall the tables are set with pressed white tablecloths.<br />\nNaturally there is an economy of space that keeps the<br />\nvisitor aware of being aboard a ship, even though -the<br />\nfloors are as steady as if on land. Everyone on the ship<br />\nwears the same clothes\u2014most of them American-bought<br />\nbecause they're cheaper here-flannels, longjohris, and<br />\ncoveralls. The captain is indistinguishable from the deck<br />\nhands except for his age. Indeed, the uniformity of<br />\nclothing demonstrates the maxim \"form follows function.\" Everyone except for the mess duty works the<br />\nsame hours. Logothetis, second in command to the<br />\ncaptain, still must oversee the nuts-and-bolts work,from<br />\ngeneral safety to painting and scraping.<br />\nLogothetis has a large sitting room furnished<br />\nwith a banquet, table, desk, book shelves\u2014and Miss<br />\nJanuary, who hangs on her nail over the desk.<br />\nThe place has the look of a dorm room. It is,<br />\nafter all, a temporary living place. Seamen will sign a<br />\nwork contract for a period of months and then live off<br />\nthe money they make for several months before taking<br />\non work aboard another ship. Logothetis has worked for 13 months without a break and has a nine-month<br />\nvacation coming up. He plans to work only 6 months<br />\nnext time.<br />\n\"I am thinking (of) the summer. The summer is<br />\nvery beautiful for my country...All the Greek seamen<br />\nlike the family. Maybe they are going to many places,<br />\nmany countries, all the countries, but I prefer my<br />\ncountry.\" 'Logothetis looks forward to tir tint when he<br />\nwill tend his orchards,orchards, swim, and eat fresh<br />\nfruit during his nine-month hiatus. But as time passes<br />\naboard ship, he says he thinks only of his job and the<br />\nwork he must do the next day. Perhaps time hangs<br />\nheaviest on his hands now, as he is relaxing in his room<br />\nafter a few days of sightseeing around Charm City, not<br />\nknowing how soon he will be able to leave port.<br />\nDoes Logothetis admire the Baltimore renaisgothic splendor of our city? He shrugs. \"The<br />\nthe<br />\nsance,<br />\nseamen like bars and girls.\" Then he smiles.<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 / MARCH 13, 1981<br />\nIMMIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIII11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111IIMIMINEIIIMMIIIMINIIMIIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIM11111111111111011111111111111111111111111111111111110111111MMINIMMENIMMIMMIMEMilliffillffilIMOINIIII<br />\n.<br />\n\"\u25aa<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u25aa\u2022\u2022\u25aa \u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n==<br /><br />\nSTUDENT COUNCIL FILM SERIES<br /><br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series presents<br /><br />\nPRESENTS:<br /><br />\n\"NO NUKES knocks your M<br />\nsocks off.\"<br />\n\u2014 ROLLING STONE W.<br />\n=--.<br />\nOMI\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n=<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\nNP<br />\n==.<br /><br />\nTHE SEDUCTIONai<br />\nOFJOE TV/VAN<br /><br />\n=<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022-1111=<br /><br />\n=7.<br /><br />\n\"Carly Simon puts in a sensational<br />\nappearance.

Mockingbird, a novel<br />\nby the little-known Walter Tevis, author<br />\nof The Man Who Fell to Earth, is such a<br />\nwork. Very few books pack such an<br />\nemotional wallop; very few are so genuine<br />\nin their depiction of the human condition<br />\nand so powerful in their message. Mockingbird, a novel about a dystopian future<br />\nuncomfortably similar to our own time,is<br />\nvirtuosic, carrying the reader from one<br />\nemotional crescendo to the next. Undoubtedly,Mockingbird is one of the best<br />\nnovels of the past decade.<br />\nThematically,Mockingbird is similar to The Man Who Fell to Earth, but it<br />\nis dramatically different in quality and<br />\ndenouement. The Man Who Fell to Earth<br />\nis the story of an alien who comes to<br />\nEarth looking for a way to help his dying<br />\nworld but is instead consumed by the<br />\nmodern maelstrom of transient pleasures<br />\n(alcohol, television, money, and power).<br />\nThe story, though relevant, has been told<br />\nbefore. Mockingbird, on the other hand,<br />\ndisplays a deeper understanding of<br />\nalienation and is a more biting condemnation of our \"live-for-the-moment\" world.<br />\nThe scenario of Mockingbird is<br />\nmodern society in ultimate social and<br />\npsychological decay, each individual<br />\nliving in complete alienation from the rest<br />\nof humanity. Speaking is a rare event,<br />\nthe ideal of Privacy worshipped above all.<br />\nWhen something questionable occurs, a<br />\nmaxim drilled into every person from<br />\nchildhood springs to mind: \"Don't ask;<br />\nrelax.\" If someone feels upset, then he<br />\ntakes a handful of sopors (tranquilizers)<br /><br />\nto cleanse him of those annoying emotions which threaten to disturb his<br />\ndrug-induced complacency. Friendship<br />\ndoes not exist, and neither does love:<br />\n\"Quick sex is best,\" and cohabitation is a<br />\ncrime. Last of all, reading is a lost art, for<br />\nit breaks the law of Privacy by allowing a<br />\nview into someone else's thoughts.<br />\nThe time in which Mockingbird is set is<br />\nunknown, for history has vanished with<br />\nreading, and no one can remember much<br />\nof anything beyond the recent past due<br />\nto the universal drugged stupor.<br /><br />\nAuthor Walter Tevis<br />\nThe power of this image of the<br />\nfuture derives from its resemblance to our<br />\npresent. Since the advent of the \"Me<br />\nGeneration\" of the '70s we have been<br />\nretreating into self-indulgent, passing<br />\nhedonism, and the world of Mockingbird<br />\nis merely a logical extrapolation of this<br />\nattitude. The population in Tevis' future<br />\nis dwindling into oblivion, and human<br />\nbeings, hopelessly illiterate, their minds<br />\ndulled by drugs, cannot save themselves.<br />\nThe metaphor for this is the central<br />\nsetting of New York City-succumbing to<br />\nentropy, the machines break down,<br />\nthe repair machines malfunctioning and<br /><br />\nMondo Bongo<br /><br />\nIrish Rats Go Global<br />\nBY GEORGE YATCHISIN<br />\nAsk a hundred people on the<br />\nstreet who Simon Crowe is and you'll<br />\nprobably get no answers. Ask the same<br />\ngroup who the Boomtown Rats are and<br />\nmaybe you'll get a few replies. Well, the<br />\nRats are a former Irish pub band that<br />\nstands somewhere between rock and<br />\nprogressive rock, and Crowe is their<br />\ndrummer, the heartbeat that livens their<br />\nlatest album, Mondo Bongo. Bongo sees<br />\nthe Rats moving on; lead singer Bob<br />\nGeldof gives up trying to be Mick Jagger<br />\nand Crowe takes the place he deserves<br />\nin the group. For anybody interested in<br />\nrecords that can be both strange and<br />\nimpossible to sit still to, Mondo Bongo is<br />\nthe disc.<br />\nThe Rats have not given up their<br />\ngreat lyrical wit. Geldof still writes some<br />\nof the nastiest lyrics this side of Elvis<br />\nCostello. With Bongo the theme has gone<br />\nglobal; in many tunes the beat is often<br />\nAfrican or reggae, and the lyrics are<br />\ndominated by Third World themes.<br />\nClearly Bongo is an album of revolution,<br />\ncapturing both the fight and the repression. \"Go Man Go\" talks of \"danger<br />\ndays\" and \"mad Charlie,\" declaring,\"the<br />\nhelter skelter's free.\" \"Banana Republic\"<br />\nlaments that \"it's a pity nothing's<br />\nchanged.\" The fight goes on and on,<br />\nnothing solved,just like the characters in<br />\nthe Boomtown Rats' best previous tune,<br />\n\"Rat Trap.\" The only outlet for the<br />\nrebellion is the music.<br /><br />\nunable to fix even themselves, the city is<br />\nslowly dying, not with a bang but with a<br />\nwhimper. The parallel to the New York<br />\nCity of today is unmistakable.<br />\nWalter Tevis shows a greater<br />\ncraftsmanship in Mockingbird than was<br />\napparent in The Man Who Fell to Earth.<br />\nAlthough the story shifts perspective<br />\nfrequently, the narrative line remains<br />\nunsevered, and we do not lose touch with<br />\nany of the characters. Tevis' greatest<br />\nimprovement is his handling of characterization, which he executes with greater<br />\ndepth, believability, and force.<br />\nThe novel's protagonist, Paul, a<br />\nperson who has taught himself the lost<br />\ntalent of reading, is a truly dynamic<br />\ncharacter. His evolution from naivete to<br />\nmaturity, from just another stupored<br />\ncitizen of a dying world to the hope of<br />\nsalvation from the slow death of the<br />\nhuman race, is a believable and interesting<br />\nprogression. His growth from confusion<br />\nto definition transforms him into a free<br />\nthinker, an individual who stands above<br />\nthe rules and not in fear of them. The<br />\nmarker against which his character is<br />\nmeasured in his lover Mary Lou,who first<br />\nshows him the artificiality of rules and<br />\nthe bleakness of the world but is later<br />\nsurpassed by him in strength of character.<br />\nAbove all, Paul is a likeable character, and<br />\nthe reader empathizes with his struggle<br />\nand exults in the final triumph of man<br />\nover rules and life over death.<br />\nThe center of the action is<br />\nSpofforth, the ultimate robot who is<br />\nultimately alienated. Spofforth is lonely<br />\nto the worst possible extreme. Even<br />\nthough he is human in form and mind,<br />\nhe is segregated from humanity by his<br />\nasexual nature, which denies him even<br /><br />\n[/\u2018 ir 51<br /><br />\nThis is where Crowe enters the<br />\nscene. Previously Crowe had few moments to shine, with the exception of<br />\n\"Wind Chill Factor\" on The Fine Art of<br />\nSurfacing. Here, he is spotlighted on<br />\nthree cuts: \"Mood Mambo,\" \"Straight<br />\nUp,\" and \"Please Don't Go.\" His open-<br /><br />\nLSoomtown<br /><br />\nempty physical pleasures. The fact that<br />\nhe is a Make Nine robot, a model of<br />\nsuperintelligent robot of which only a<br />\nfew were made, sets him above and apart<br />\nfrom the rest of the robots. Most tragically, he is alienated from himself; his<br />\nmind, though copied from a human<br />\nmind, has had certain \"unnecessary\"<br />\nmemories deleted, and Spofforth is<br />\nhaunted by fragments of images which he<br />\ncannot grasp. His only wish is to die, but<br />\nhis programming prevents him from<br />\ncommitting suicide as long as there are<br />\nhumans alive to serve. Spofforth, denied<br />\na social identity or self-identity, is the<br />\nquintessential victim of solitude.<br />\nThe message of Mockingbird is<br />\nthat there are transcendent values which<br />\ncan only be understood through maturity. Quick sex, drugs, television, pessimism, religion, passivity, and apathy are<br />\nall cul-de-sacs. Only love, life, courage,<br />\ncompassion,and knowledge really matter.<br />\nTevis may appear to be a romantic on the<br />\nsurface, but his \"romanticism\" is not<br />\nbased on a starry-eyed perception of the<br />\nworld. The world of Mockingbird is<br />\nstartlingly realistic, and Tevis extracts his<br />\ntheme from this harsh, honest setting.<br />\nDespite its somberness, Mockingbird carries a positive message. Although<br />\nthe novel is realistic in tone, the protagonist is not ground into the dirt by the<br />\nheel of society as is the usual case in<br />\nrealistic fiction. Mockingbird asserts that<br />\nsociety, like its rules, is an artificial being<br />\nand can be overcome by the individual.<br />\nReading Mockingbird is like listening<br />\nto Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony-both<br />\nare melancholy in tone, but underlying<br />\neach is a chord of vitality, joi de vivre,<br />\nand hope.<br /><br />\nndo move on-from<br /><br />\ning on the last tune is downright spectacular, superhumanly quick yet precise to<br />\nthe second. It may be saying too much,<br />\nbut Crowe could be the Keith Moon of<br />\nthe '80s. He brings life even to the<br /><br />\nHun pubs to the intro won&amp;<br /><br />\nsongs where he is not featured, and one is<br />\nforced to, listen to him-something true of<br />\nprecious few drummers today.<br />\nNevertheless, this Boomtown Rats<br />\nalbum more than any other makes one<br />\nfall into the whole song rather than focus<br />\nsolely on Geldors singing or a particular<br />\ninstrument. Solos are kept sparse and<br />\nshort; the guitars are negligible except as<br />\nrhythmic devices, and often the melody<br />\nis carried in the vocals only. Simply,the<br />\nalbum is a great group effort.<br />\n\"Go Man Go,\" which should be<br />\nthe single of the album, captures the<br />\nclassic Rats sound-somewhere between<br />\n\"Diamond Smiles\" and \"Wind Chill<br />\nFactor\"--and shows their supreme wit,<br />\nincluding a Mormon Tabernacle Choir<br />\nchorus singing oy-vey. It also features Dr.<br />\nDave McHale ripping through a perfect<br />\nsax break that makes the song.<br />\nThe next cut, \"Under Their<br />\nThumb,\" a cover of Richard's and<br />\nJagger's \"Under My Thumb,\" lays to rest<br />\nany notion that the Rats are merely a<br />\npunked-up mirror image of the Stones.<br />\nIt's a violent, speeded-up cover, with new<br />\nlyrics by Geldof, which he delivers like<br />\na paranoid on bennies. Keyboardist<br />\nJohnnie Fingers follows with an organ<br />\nsolo as tortured as Geldofs vocal, while<br />\nbassist Pete Briquette and Crowe throw<br />\nthe rhythm section into overdrive; the<br />\nend result can only be called intense.<br />\ncont. on p. 17<br /><br />\nPAGE 16 / MARCH 13, 1981<br /><br />\nThis Week's<br />\nCareer Advising Seminar:<br /><br />\nSOPHOMORES<br />\nAND<br />\nPsychology &amp;<br />\nJUNIORS<br /><br />\nSocial Relations<br />\nTUESDAYMARCH17 4:00<br />\nin the L-VRoom<br /><br />\nEARN UP TO $850<br />\nPER MONTH WITH<br />\nTHE POSSIBILITY<br />\nOF A FULL<br />\nSCHOLARSHIP!<br /><br />\nSpeakers:<br /><br />\nThe Navy is seeking qualified sophomores<br />\nand juniors for the Nuclear Power Officer<br />\nCandidate Program.Applicants must be in<br />\npursuit of a bachelor's degree in the fields<br />\nof chemistry, physics, math and engineer\u2014<br />\ning.

Instead, he is evaluating the performers he has on<br />\nhand now, and is looking to the<br />\nfuture. In two recent scrimmages against Essex Community<br />\nCollege and Harford Community<br /><br />\nk.;ollege, Babb gave all his team<br />\nmembers an equal amount of<br />\nplaying time. Though Hopkins<br />\nlost both scrimmages, Babb<br />\nconsidered them very productive<br />\nbecause he could see just what<br />\neach player was able to do.

But they<br />\ncontinued to make sure that the<br />\nBaltimore Clippers who take the<br />\nice during the playoffs will be<br />\na new edition by sending away<br />\none familiar name and bringing<br />\nback another.<br />\nKim Spencer, one of the last<br />\nof the original '79 Clippers, was<br />\nassigned to Toledo of the<br />\nInternational Hockey League<br />\nlast week and was replaced<br />\nalmost immediately by Henry<br />\nTaylor, the Clippers' leading<br />\nscorer last season, whose playing time at Oklahoma City had<br />\nbecome limited due to the<br />\nreturn of several injured players.<br />\nHe will remain in Baltimore for<br />\nat least the coming week and<br />\npossibly through the playoffs.<br />\nThere was no doubt that<br />\nTaylor had been well remembered in Baltimore. The 3779<br />\nfans who witnessed his return to<br />\nthe city against Hampton gave<br />\nhim a standing ovation when his<br />\nname was announced at the start<br />\nand another one 51<br />\n/<br />\n2 minutes<br />\nlater, when he stole the puck<br />\nand scored to tie the game.<br />\nFrom then on it was all<br />\nClippers, as they outshot the<br />\nAces 23-4 in the first period and<br />\noutscored them 3-1. The final<br />\ntwo periods were little more<br />\nthan target practice in an 8-2<br />\nClipper romp; Hampton goalie<br />\nBob Parent was mercifully rem-<br /><br />\noved after allowing two cheap<br />\ngoals in one minute. Pete Hayek<br />\nwound up with a hat trick, and<br />\nTaylor and Glenn Kulyk chipped<br />\nin two goals apiece.<br />\nIt was a sharp contrast to a<br />\n3-3 tie between the same two<br />\nteams only the previous night.<br />\nTaylor believed that the Aces<br />\n\"didn't have much energy\" in<br />\nthe rematch.<br />\nThe Clippers kept their momentum with a 7-4 win at<br />\nRichmond Saturday, avenging an<br />\nembarrassing defeat at the hands<br />\nof the Rifles.<br />\nThe remainder of the Clipper schedule could have been<br />\nAfter<br />\nconsiderably kinder.<br />\nanother game against Hampton<br />\nlast night, the Clippers return<br />\nhome to host Richmond tonight<br />\nand Salem tomorrow. Then<br />\ncomes every coach's nightmarefour games in a row against the<br />\nrunaway league leader, the Erie<br />\nBlades.

It has<br />\nbeen eight hours since lunch and<br />\nso Haswell wastes no time in<br />\nborrowing the cone from the<br />\nsweet cherub's hands and starting to devour it. The response is<br />\nimmediate<br />\nand<br />\nexpected:<br />\nMadeline starts bawling, twelveyear-old brother Henry leaps at<br />\nHaswell, and soon three other<br />\nFranklin youngsters attack their<br />\neldest brother and knock him to<br />\nthe floor. So now a 200-pound<br />\nlummox, the first male in well<br />\nover a decade of Hopkins<br />\nathletics to letter in three varsity<br />\nsports in one year, is pinned on<br />\nhis back amidst screeching brothers and sisters.<br />\nLying on the floor on top of<br />\nmelting ice cream is a pretty<br />\nignoble position for someone<br />\nwho is supposed to be an athle:ic superman. But this is the<br />\nkey: it was unexpected. By his<br />\nown admission Franklin owes his<br />\nsuccess in football, wrestling and<br />\nlacrosse t-is year not to fleetness<br />\nof foot or greatness of bulk;<br />\nrather, it is \"the ability to<br />\nanticipate and expect, along<br />\nwith experience\" that has earned<br />\nhim success in his athletic<br />\nendeavors,<br /><br />\nHowever, the fundamentals<br />\nof shedding blockers, takedowns, and rides and clears are<br />\nwell understood by Franklin. \"I<br />\nfirst started organized athletics<br />\nwhen I was seven years old,\"<br />\nsays the 21-year-old sophomore.<br />\nin his three-letter status,<br />\nFranklin joins a club that has<br />\nhad only a few members in<br />\nmodern Blue Jay athletic hisThey are very few<br />\ntory.<br />\nand far between until 1957,<br />\nwhen former attorney general<br />\nBenjamin Civiletti lettered in<br />\nfootball, basketball and track.<br />\nFranklin must be honored to be<br />\nin such august company. \"To<br />\ntell you the truth, it's not<br />\nsomething I think about. It's<br />\nhard enough just living from<br />\npractice to practice, wondering<br />\nwhether I'll do well on a given<br />\nday.\"<br />\nAs to the inevitable question as to which sport he prefers<br />\nthe most, Franklin is very<br />\ndiplomatic. \"I like each for<br />\ndifferent reasons. Football is<br />\nfun because of the hard-hitting,<br />\ncontact environment. Wrestling<br />\nis enjoyable because of the<br />\nindividual competition. And I<br />\nlike lacrosse because of the fine<br />\nprograM we have here at Hopkins.\"<br />\nAre there any times when<br />\nathletics becomes a burden?<br />\n\"There are days when I've<br />\nscrewed up in practice or when<br /><br />\nthe bookwork starts to pile up,<br />\nand I truly wonder whether it's<br />\nworth it. But I guess when game<br />\nday comes, and with it, the thrill<br />\nof competition, all my doubts<br />\nare erased.\"<br />\n\"I guess basically I'm a competitive person; sports gives me the<br />\noutlet to satisfy my competitive<br />\nurge. And in athletics I like the<br />\nfeeling of working with teammates for a common, unselfish<br />\ngoal. In this aspect, I really<br />\nbelieve athletics is character<br />\nbuilding. And of course, 'in a<br />\nsound mind, a sound body.\"<br />\nAs Hopkins' academics have<br />\ntoughened, so has the quality of<br />\nvarsity athletic competition. So<br />\nobviously, someone who competes in this milieu must be<br />\nphysically gifted. Franklin is the<br />\nfirst to disagree. \"I'm not big or<br />\nfast. But I've tried to be a good<br />\nlearner and a hard worker. I've<br />\nbeen lucky to have had good<br />\ncoaching in my athletic experiences.\" Blue Jay coach Jerry<br />\nPfeiffer, who has guided Franklin in both football and lacrosse,<br />\nvoices<br />\ncomments.<br />\nsimilar<br />\n\"Haswell is a smart, heady ball<br />\nplayer.
