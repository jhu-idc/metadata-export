The first concerned the schedule for the 1930-31 season. It<br />\nis very similar to that of last year. We note with pleasure the addition of Western Maryland and Pennsylvania Military College. Con.sidering the fact that basketball was re-established at Hopkins only<br />\nrecently, the teams have been good and the opponents of a high<br />\n,calibre. The second announcement was that the Jay team would practice in the Loyola gym.<br />\nSome three years ago, a movement was put on foot to finance a<br />\ngym for Hopkins. Little has been heard about the so-called Cage<br />\nFund for over a year. It is now said that the matter will have to be<br />\ndropped until better business conditions again prevail. The Cage<br />\nFund drive was started shortly after the Levering Hall campaign.<br />\nBaltimore business men and Hopkins graduates out of town gave freely<br />\nso the latter. The Cage Fund, however, did not meet with similar<br />\nsuccess. We believe that this was primarily due to the fact that all<br />\nof the prospects had been solicited in the drive for the activities<br />\nbuilding. The campaign for the gym met with comparatively good<br />\nsuccess on the Homewood Campus. More was pledged for it than<br />\nfor Levering Hall.<br />\nWe would like to see a re-opening of the drive for the Cage Fund in<br />\nthe near future, for we believe it would meet with success now. There<br />\nis no question but what a gym is needed. The great majority of Hopkins students have little chance for any physical development at Homewood. The mind will not function unless the body is in a healthy<br />\ncondition. University authorities realize this, but at present do not<br />\nhave the necessary capital to erect the kind of a gym that would be<br />\n.a credit to Hopkins. Anyone interested in the general welfare of<br />\nHopkins should be glad to contribute to such a cause.<br />\nLooking at the situation from the point of view of one interested<br />\nin athletics, the great advantage of a gym are obvious. Basketball<br />\nteams would improve immensely. Last year, it was all but impossible<br />\nfor the entire basketball squad to get to Carlin's with any amount of<br />\nregularity. Basketball is a game that requires team work to a very<br />\nhigh degree. Team work cannot be obtained without constant and<br />\nregular practice. Indoor track and tennis would also be made possible<br />\nand hence an improvement in these sports could be expected. Spells<br />\n\u2022of bad weather sometimes force the football and lacrosse teams to<br />\nsuspend practice. With a gym on the campus, some sort of practice<br />\ncould be continued during these periods.<br />\nIt would seem that the fact that Hopkins needs a cage, and needs<br />\nit badly, would be obvious to anyone. It would also seem that a concentrated and well organized drive would bring the desired results.<br />\n<br />\nEXPLANATION<br />\nto the fact that some students are laboring under the misDUEapprehension<br />\nthat the opinions expressed in a recent article rethose of THE NEWS-LETTER staff,<br />\nviewing the Black and Blue ay were<br />\nwe deem it necessary to offer a word of explanation.

The practices are being held<br />\ndaily and consist of limbering-up<br />\nexercises and long runs around the<br />\ntrack. A number of men who have<br />\nreturned this year are out every<br />\nafternoon warming up. Among<br />\nthese are: Lockard, Chassin and<br />\nLink, in the sprints; Dorman, in the<br />\nweight events; Caldwell and Forrest, in the high jump; Burke, in<br />\nthe javelin throw, and Quirk, in<br />\nboth the pole vault and the javelin<br />\nthrow; Coburn, in the hurdles, and<br />\nMilstone, in the distance events.<br />\nSeveral of the long distance men<br />\nare training themselves by running<br />\nwith the cross-country team. Besides this group of yeterans there<br />\nare a number of Freshmen out for<br />\nthe team.<br />\n<br />\nThe University of Maryland<br />\nteam will play Hopkins on January<br />\n22 and February 25. Last year<br />\nMaryland won both games.<br />\nLast year the Hopkins five halved<br />\nits series with St. Johns and lost<br />\nits lone game with Georgetown.<br />\n<br />\nThe show started promptly at the<br />\nscheduled hour, to the accompaniment of strains(decidedly strained)<br />\nof popular melodies played by the<br />\nBlue Jay Orchestra. Then the<br />\nmaster of ceremonies, Bill Rogers,<br />\ncame upon the scene. Rogers, in<br />\nimitation of his famous namesake,<br />\ntried to enlighten the gathering,<br />\nwhich was eager to know the latest<br />\nin men's wear, by some so-called<br />\nwise-cracks. Not in the least whit<br />\ndiscouraged by the impatience of the<br />\nmob, he introduced the first mannikin, none other than L. Whiting<br />\nFarinholt, ),v hose Barnstormer<br />\ntraining stood him in good stead as<br />\nhe nonchalantly strolled in, puffing<br />\non a cigarette. Instead of being<br />\ngreeted by catcalls and jeers, as<br />\ncould be expected in other circles,<br />\ncomments as to the symmetry of his<br />\nclothing and the coloring of his tie<br />\nwere heard on all sides.<br />\nPerhaps the managers of the<br />\nshow thought that some manliness<br />\nshould be ejected into the proceedings, in order to allay the doubts of<br />\nany stranger who might be present,<br />\nand who never attended college. So<br />\nthe next character in our little<br />\ndrama was a mannikin attired in a<br />\nvarsity football uniform. Then a<br />\ngentleman strode in wearing a<br />\n\"soup and fish\" outfit followed by<br />\nanother clad in so-called campus<br />\nclothes. Farinholt next appeared<br />\nwearing a lounging robe and a bored<br />\nlook. Next the center of the stage<br />\nwas occupied by \"Sonny\" Kneip, arrayed in the garb of a knight of<br />\nthe road. Deeming this to be a psychological moment, the next model<br />\nintroduced was a replica of the Old<br />\nTopper as he is pictured by Adolph<br />\nMenjou. The next two mannikins<br />\nwere clothed in oxford gray and<br />\nIndian regalia, respectively. To end<br />\nthe show, a sports costume came<br />\nupon the scene, the costume being<br />\nmotivated by Kneip. His appearance was greeted by many oh's and<br />\noh's, especially after Rogers gave<br />\nthe price of the coat being $25.<br />\nThus ended the attempt of the<br />\nBarnstormers to edify the Hopkins<br />\nstudent regarding the clothing the<br />\nwell-dressed man should wear. The<br />\nonly murmurs of discontent were<br />\n'heard from those chronic dissenters,<br />\nyvho wanted to see the latest in<br />\nmen's unmentionables. However,<br />\n'due to the sobering influence of the<br />\n\u2022-Y. M. C. A. building, this was not<br />\ndone. The presence of women, we<br />\n\u2022are sure, would not have detered<br />\nthe models from exhibiting themselves in silken underthings, for<br />\nthey would give their all for their<br />\ntrt.

L. Polk Printing Company, 1930 Clifton Ave., Baltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nEDITORIALS<br />\nTHE CAGE FUND<br /><br />\nTWO<br /><br />\nannouncements concerning basketball were released yesterday. The first concerned the schedule for the 1930-31 season. It<br />\nis very similar to that of last year. We note with pleasure the addition of Western Maryland and Pennsylvania Military College. Con.sidering the fact that basketball was re-established at Hopkins only<br />\nrecently, the teams have been good and the opponents of a high<br />\n,calibre. The second announcement was that the Jay team would practice in the Loyola gym.<br />\nSome three years ago, a movement was put on foot to finance a<br />\ngym for Hopkins. Little has been heard about the so-called Cage<br />\nFund for over a year. It is now said that the matter will have to be<br />\ndropped until better business conditions again prevail. The Cage<br />\nFund drive was started shortly after the Levering Hall campaign.<br />\nBaltimore business men and Hopkins graduates out of town gave freely<br />\nso the latter. The Cage Fund, however, did not meet with similar<br />\nsuccess. We believe that this was primarily due to the fact that all<br />\nof the prospects had been solicited in the drive for the activities<br />\nbuilding. The campaign for the gym met with comparatively good<br />\nsuccess on the Homewood Campus. More was pledged for it than<br />\nfor Levering Hall.<br />\nWe would like to see a re-opening of the drive for the Cage Fund in<br />\nthe near future, for we believe it would meet with success now. There<br />\nis no question but what a gym is needed. The great majority of Hopkins students have little chance for any physical development at Homewood. The mind will not function unless the body is in a healthy<br />\ncondition. University authorities realize this, but at present do not<br />\nhave the necessary capital to erect the kind of a gym that would be<br />\n.a credit to Hopkins. Anyone interested in the general welfare of<br />\nHopkins should be glad to contribute to such a cause.<br />\nLooking at the situation from the point of view of one interested<br />\nin athletics, the great advantage of a gym are obvious. Basketball<br />\nteams would improve immensely. Last year, it was all but impossible<br />\nfor the entire basketball squad to get to Carlin's with any amount of<br />\nregularity. Basketball is a game that requires team work to a very<br />\nhigh degree. Team work cannot be obtained without constant and<br />\nregular practice. Indoor track and tennis would also be made possible<br />\nand hence an improvement in these sports could be expected. Spells<br />\n\u2022of bad weather sometimes force the football and lacrosse teams to<br />\nsuspend practice. With a gym on the campus, some sort of practice<br />\ncould be continued during these periods.<br />\nIt would seem that the fact that Hopkins needs a cage, and needs<br />\nit badly, would be obvious to anyone. It would also seem that a concentrated and well organized drive would bring the desired results.<br /><br />\nEXPLANATION<br />\nto the fact that some students are laboring under the misDUEapprehension<br />\nthat the opinions expressed in a recent article rethose of THE NEWS-LETTER staff,<br />\nviewing the Black and Blue ay were<br />\nwe deem it necessary to offer a word of explanation.

Last year<br />\nMaryland won both games.<br />\nLast year the Hopkins five halved<br />\nits series with St. Johns and lost<br />\nits lone game with Georgetown.<br /><br />\nThe show started promptly at the<br />\nscheduled hour, to the accompaniment of strains(decidedly strained)<br />\nof popular melodies played by the<br />\nBlue Jay Orchestra. Then the<br />\nmaster of ceremonies, Bill Rogers,<br />\ncame upon the scene. Rogers, in<br />\nimitation of his famous namesake,<br />\ntried to enlighten the gathering,<br />\nwhich was eager to know the latest<br />\nin men's wear, by some so-called<br />\nwise-cracks. Not in the least whit<br />\ndiscouraged by the impatience of the<br />\nmob, he introduced the first mannikin, none other than L. Whiting<br />\nFarinholt, ),v hose Barnstormer<br />\ntraining stood him in good stead as<br />\nhe nonchalantly strolled in, puffing<br />\non a cigarette. Instead of being<br />\ngreeted by catcalls and jeers, as<br />\ncould be expected in other circles,<br />\ncomments as to the symmetry of his<br />\nclothing and the coloring of his tie<br />\nwere heard on all sides.<br />\nPerhaps the managers of the<br />\nshow thought that some manliness<br />\nshould be ejected into the proceedings, in order to allay the doubts of<br />\nany stranger who might be present,<br />\nand who never attended college. So<br />\nthe next character in our little<br />\ndrama was a mannikin attired in a<br />\nvarsity football uniform. Then a<br />\ngentleman strode in wearing a<br />\n\"soup and fish\" outfit followed by<br />\nanother clad in so-called campus<br />\nclothes. Farinholt next appeared<br />\nwearing a lounging robe and a bored<br />\nlook. Next the center of the stage<br />\nwas occupied by \"Sonny\" Kneip, arrayed in the garb of a knight of<br />\nthe road. Deeming this to be a psychological moment, the next model<br />\nintroduced was a replica of the Old<br />\nTopper as he is pictured by Adolph<br />\nMenjou. The next two mannikins<br />\nwere clothed in oxford gray and<br />\nIndian regalia, respectively. To end<br />\nthe show, a sports costume came<br />\nupon the scene, the costume being<br />\nmotivated by Kneip. His appearance was greeted by many oh's and<br />\noh's, especially after Rogers gave<br />\nthe price of the coat being $25.<br />\nThus ended the attempt of the<br />\nBarnstormers to edify the Hopkins<br />\nstudent regarding the clothing the<br />\nwell-dressed man should wear. The<br />\nonly murmurs of discontent were<br />\n'heard from those chronic dissenters,<br />\nyvho wanted to see the latest in<br />\nmen's unmentionables. However,<br />\n'due to the sobering influence of the<br />\n\u2022-Y. M. C. A. building, this was not<br />\ndone. The presence of women, we<br />\n\u2022are sure, would not have detered<br />\nthe models from exhibiting themselves in silken underthings, for<br />\nthey would give their all for their<br />\ntrt. Truly, every day in every way,<br />\n'the youth of America is learning to<br />\nappreciate the aesthetic things of<br />\nlife, and is drawing farther and farther away from that rough, hardy<br />\npioneer spirit that makes them sit<br />\non flag-poles.<br /><br />\narode*<br />\nLOTHING<br />\n.tlemettii fienntiollitt4<br /><br />\nVeteran Squad<br /><br />\nMADISON AVENUE COR.
