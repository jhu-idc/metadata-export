I can't see<br />\nhow anyone could be for it,<br />\ncontainment.<br />\nAnd it's spring, and they're since it is defined as \"a condiyoung, and why shouldn't they? tion of decline and decay.\" Of<br />\nThe News-Letter heartily all the Romans, certainly the<br />\nendorses spring.<br />\nmost \"anti-decadence\" were the<br />\n<br />\nLevine On The Green<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nSelena,'cause everything is, like,<br />\nequal!\"<br />\nSo Selena and Rocco and<br />\nthe pimply guy and the Yemenite chick are all set, and away we<br />\ngo. Isn't it funny how they<br />\nwaited all year, through the<br />\nlong, cold, and lonely winter<br />\nnights? It was one thing for<br />\nSelena and Rocco because they<br />\nhad each other, and things might<br />\nhave gotten tricky come time to<br />\npay the landlord and the phone<br />\ncompany, but we can't assume<br />\nthe same for the pimply guy and<br />\nthe Yemenite chick. They may<br />\nhave had no one, all those<br />\nevenings in the Hut wondering<br />\nif Rocco or Selena were really<br />\nlooking at them, telling themselves that it's really better this<br />\nway because there isn't enough<br />\ntime, anyway (Naturally, there's<br />\nmore time during the last two<br />\nweeks of school when the days<br />\nare a benevolent ocean, and we<br />\nflit gaily about like porpoises<br />\nat play); or that Rocco or Selena<br />\nis probably already attached.<br />\nand that's a bad scene that no<br />\none needs to go through again<br />\n(which doesn't prevent us from<br />\nreading The Harrad Experiment<br />\nuntil it's time to catch the<br />\nshuttle bus home); or that Hunk<br />\nor Piece is probably just the kind<br />\nof ice-cube who screwed us over<br />\nlast time, and we're better off<br />\ntaking cold showers (and so we<br />\nimmerse ourselves in a fascinating discussion about Robert<br />\nFrost with the dweehus pretentious across the table, and<br />\nexcuse ourselves an hour later to<br />\ngo sit on the toilet and weep).<br />\nYes, the rationalizations for<br />\ninactivity are borderline at best,<br />\nbut the justifications for everything from puckering or pederasty later on truely defy the<br />\nimagination.<br />\n\"Actually, the real reason<br />\nI'm doing it is so Selena doesn't<br />\nhave to feel guilty.\"<br />\n\"Rocco and I need this to<br />\nmake sure our relationship is<br />\n<br />\nStoics. The greates Stoic of all<br />\ntime was the Emperor Marcus<br />\nAurelius--one of the most persistent persecutors of the Christians. This was the general<br />\npattern: Christianity was opposed by solid men of affairs,<br />\ngood Empire builders all. One<br />\ncan't live a life of perpetual<br />\ndebauch and have the energy to<br />\nhunt down the enemies of the<br />\nEmpire. If decadents are antiChristian now, it is only because<br />\nthey now run the world.<br />\nIt seems clear to me that if<br />\nMr. Paul had thought about his<br />\nchoices for required reading,<br />\nJefferson and Twain, he would<br />\nhave made other choices. Jefferson, up to the end of his life.<br />\nwas troubled by the vast wrong<br />\nof slavery and his.own participation in it. He wondered how<br />\nlong a just God would delay<br />\nhis punishment. Twain, for his<br />\npart, hated God, hated man, and<br />\nhated himself. His later work is<br />\nthe work of a man who could<br />\nnot see beyond his own pride<br />\nand greed, which tortured him<br />\nall the while.<br />\nA letter must have purpose,<br />\nand the purpose of Mr. Paul's<br />\nletter is clear. \"Don't let them<br />\nfool you,\" he warns those who<br />\nhold his views--all \"fiscal conservatives and social liberals,\" no<br />\ndoubt. If he can write a letter of<br />\nwarning and have it printed, so<br />\ncan I, and I hope I have succeeded.There is one more warning,<br />\nspoken long ago, that I would<br />\nlike to add. This is directed not<br />\njust to Christians, nor to Christians and Jews, but to all who<br />\ncare to listen. It comes from the<br />\nsource of our University's<br />\nmotto, so it is quite appropriate:<br />\n<br />\n-rker, elVaAPO<br />\nCA<br />\n<br />\n13&-A- \"ro cHezs-E09<br />\n<br />\n6R1N)-<br />\n<br />\n.#<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n-pi<br />\n<br />\n76.641/4<br />\n76...acak<br />\n<br />\nIf the world hates you,<br />\nremember that it hated me<br />\nbefore you.<br />\nIf you heknzged to the world,<br />\nthe world vvould love you as its<br />\nown;<br />\nbut because you do not belong<br />\nto the world,<br />\ntherePre the world hates you.<br />\nAnyone who hates me hates my<br />\nFather.<br />\nThat should help settle the<br />\nquestion of who is fooling<br />\nwhom.<br />\nShalom<br />\nRobert B.

ASS, XYZ, ETC.<br />\nFort Haydon, MD<br />\n<br />\n\fNot Quite Newsworthy<br />\nDiscovering Colombo<br />\nRecent evidence seems to show<br />\nthat Christopher Columbus may have<br />\nmade a heretofore undiscovered expedition to Baltimore. Diggings on the<br />\nformer site of Levering Hall at Hopkins'<br />\nHomewood Campus have proven, with<br />\nlittle doubt, that a man called Colombo<br />\nonce walked here. Columbus (known as<br />\nColombo in his native Italy) is veiled in<br />\nmystery and surrounded by legend. In<br />\nfact, man and myth are so intertwined as<br />\nto confuse even the most ardent historian. This, of course, means that every<br />\nnew shred of evidence is carefully examined by a score of Columbian historians.<br />\nResearch first focused on the<br />\nHomewood Campus when Levering Hall<br />\nwas condemned and razed. The building<br />\nhad not been used for many years and<br />\nhad become seriously infested with rats.<br />\nThe vermin had been cited by the<br />\nBaltimore City Police Department as a<br />\ndisturbance to the peace because of the<br />\nloud noise they created each Thursday<br />\nthe dome of the former<br />\nnight under<br />\nso-called \"Rathskeller.\" The problem<br />\nbecame a serious emergency when a<br />\nHopkins undergraduate, while exploring<br />\nthe ruins one day, fell into a mass of<br />\nteaming rats and was devoured within<br />\nseconds.<br />\n<br />\nAdministration officials decided to<br />\ndestroy the building immediately. Within<br />\na few days of the demolition, eager<br />\nstudents of the Archeology Department<br />\nwere combing the area for relics of the<br />\npast. The first discoveries were fairly<br />\nrecent--plastic ID cards, old-fashioned<br />\n\"lacrosse balls\" and a primitive electronics game. Then a first-year graduate<br />\nstudent stumbled over a plastic nameplate<br />\nbearing the words, \"Chris Colombo.\"<br />\nThe nameplate, now authenticated by<br />\nseveral prominent archeologists, has made<br />\nseveral important historical contributions.<br />\nFirst, the proof that Christopher<br />\nColumbus did journey to Baltimore in<br />\none of his later voyages seems incontrovertible. Secondly, archeologists were<br />\nsurprised to discover that plastic seems to<br />\nhave been invented in the 15th century.<br />\n<br />\nber of any ethnic or racial group other<br />\nthan Scottish or Afro-American. The<br />\nrecord clearly shows that collegeeducated applicants have met with a<br />\nstone wall here, too, except for a brief<br />\ninflux of Marxist graduate students back<br />\nin the early '80s. The net effect of the<br />\nUniversity's hiring and tenure practices<br />\nhas been to create what some view as a<br />\ndismaying homogeneity of the plant-op<br />\nstaff.<br />\n\"I don't like to be the one to say<br />\nit, but it seems to me that there's mischief in the machine shop, so to speak,\"<br />\nsaid Dr. David Harvey, Gadfly Professor<br />\nEmeritus of Geography and Environmental Electioneering. \"Too often, the<br />\nwhite affluent student in Wolman or<br />\nMcCoy who has complained about<br />\nroaches or a stopped W.C. has had the<br />\nexperience of dealing with a seemingly<br />\npoor, oppressed, and ethnic repairman.<br />\nWhile this fosters a healthy sense of<br />\nmiddle-class guilt in the student, I feel<br />\nnevertheless that the plant-op people<br />\nshould be ashamed of themselves. Everyone knows they earn more than the<br />\nprofessors do.\"<br />\nHarvey has been an outspoken<br />\ncritic of plant-op and the powerful Johns<br />\nHopkins Employees Association (JHEA)<br />\nsince they sabotaged his attempt to<br />\nunionize the faculty here last year.<br />\nOf course, Harvey's view is just<br />\none side of the coin. Admininstration<br />\nofficials adamantly maintain that all<br />\ndecisions pursuant to plant operations<br />\nhave been made with absolute fairness<br />\nin the pure and unsullied atmosphere of<br />\nacademia, subject to no undue pressures,<br />\ninfluences, or monies exchanged with the<br />\nFederal Regulatory Commission on Hiring Practices.<br />\n\"We adamantly maintain that all<br />\ndecisions pursuant to plant-op have been<br />\nmade with absolute fairness in the pure<br />\nand unsullied atmosphere of academia,<br />\nsubject to no undue pressures, influences<br />\nor monies exchanged with the Federal<br />\nRegulatory Commission on Hiring Practices,\" adamantly maintained Anna Suskind, Hereditary Dean of the Arts and<br />\nSciences. \"Not only that, but we're<br />\nkeeping a complete dossier on anyone<br />\nwho thinks otherwise.\"<br />\nSuskind's sentiments were fervently echoed by Dr. David Newman,Dean of<br />\nAll He Surveys.\"They don't have a case,\"<br />\nfervently echoed Newman, who conceded<br />\nlater that he wasn't sure which particular<br />\ncontroversial situation was being discussed.<br />\nIs there discrimination at Hopkins<br />\nplant-op?

Viggiani's<br />\nduties will entail supervision of the<br />\ncampus social activities; Lu will supervise<br />\nsocial services and interactions. When<br />\nasked to remark on his promotion,<br />\nViggiani said, \"Wow, it's fantastic!!!<br />\nWhat a great opportunity to keep my<br />\nswivel well greased. I mean,I get to go to<br />\nall the dances on campus and twist the<br />\nnight away!\" His last words were lost as<br />\nhe spun off to his next affair.

Until 1999 it was<br />\nthought that there was a stipulation in<br />\nthe lease for the property that no building could be taller than Gilman Hall. An<br />\nextensive search of the Archives, kept on<br />\nF level of the library, proved no such<br />\nrecord exists. So it is likely that the<br />\nUniversity will begin to build up, instead<br />\nof out. Lu said \"If only we'd known this<br />\nwhen we added E through 11 levels to the<br />\nlibrary.\"<br />\nLu also announced that the<br />\nLiberal Arts Department would be moved<br />\nfrom the fourth floor of Gilman Hall to<br />\nthe Gatehouse (formerly the office for a<br />\nstudent newspaper). Lu said, \"Those<br />\nLiberal Arts people are using a lot of<br />\nspace for what can best be described as a<br />\n<br />\nGlorious Mudd<br />\n<br />\npreholocaust monuments here on the<br />\nHopkins Campus.

Fortunately we have<br />\nfound pictures of this device, and thus<br />\nhave some clue to its use. The pictures<br />\nshow one person kneeling as if in supplication, with his arms holding the sides of<br />\nthe basin. The yellow stains have led<br />\nsome scientists to believe that the basin<br />\nwas used as a receptacle for yellowed<br />\ntumors removed in primitive brain<br />\nsurgery. Other believe that cooks used<br />\nthem to wash vegetables. One professor<br />\nfrom Stanford claims that the letter 's' in<br />\n`sloan' is really a dollar sign, and should<br />\nthus be read as \"Sloan.\" According to our<br />\nrecords of student rituals, during times of<br />\neconomic despair a student would consume large amounts of alcohol and then<br />\npray to the \"loan\" idols for monetary aid.<br />\nsideline, and a burden to this University.\"<br />\nAt this, both professors of the Liberal<br />\nArts department walked out. The Science<br />\nfaculty, which has been complaining<br />\nabout the lack of space for their departments, cheered at Lu's announcement.<br />\nLast week, the Wyman Park<br />\nAssociation, representing the community<br />\naround the park, filed a suit against the<br />\nUniversity, charging that constructing<br />\npart of the Black and Decker engineering<br />\nbuilding under the park constituted<br />\n\"flagrant trespassing.\" Lu said, \"We'll<br />\nhandle it the way we always handle it.\"<br />\nLu was apparently referring to the<br />\ndefense used against a similar suit when<br />\nthe Space Telescope Science Institute was<br />\nextended underneath the park. In that<br />\nsuit, University attorneys argued that the<br />\nlease for the park only applied to the<br />\nsurface, and not the space below the<br />\n<br />\nsurface. The fact that this defense was<br />\nsuccessful before nearly guarantees its<br />\nsuccess now.<br />\nIt is interesting to recall that at<br />\none time there was no Liberal Arts<br />\nDepartment. Before its formation in<br />\n1993, there were many different departments which taught various facets of the<br />\nliberal arts: Political Science, Humanities, Writing Seminars(?), Anthropology,<br />\nand even an entire department for History. Most of these departments were<br />\nphased out before the formation of<br />\nthe Liberal Arts Department. A University spokesman said at the time, \"After<br />\nall, what is this University for?

There<br />\nsetting from the black cultural milieux is no attempt to blend the magazine<br />\ncutouts into a seamless montage--they are<br />\nobstrusive, and quite expressive.

ASS, XYZ, ETC.<br />\nFort Haydon, MD<br /><br />\nNot Quite Newsworthy<br />\nDiscovering Colombo<br />\nRecent evidence seems to show<br />\nthat Christopher Columbus may have<br />\nmade a heretofore undiscovered expedition to Baltimore. Diggings on the<br />\nformer site of Levering Hall at Hopkins'<br />\nHomewood Campus have proven, with<br />\nlittle doubt, that a man called Colombo<br />\nonce walked here. Columbus (known as<br />\nColombo in his native Italy) is veiled in<br />\nmystery and surrounded by legend. In<br />\nfact, man and myth are so intertwined as<br />\nto confuse even the most ardent historian. This, of course, means that every<br />\nnew shred of evidence is carefully examined by a score of Columbian historians.<br />\nResearch first focused on the<br />\nHomewood Campus when Levering Hall<br />\nwas condemned and razed. The building<br />\nhad not been used for many years and<br />\nhad become seriously infested with rats.<br />\nThe vermin had been cited by the<br />\nBaltimore City Police Department as a<br />\ndisturbance to the peace because of the<br />\nloud noise they created each Thursday<br />\nthe dome of the former<br />\nnight under<br />\nso-called \"Rathskeller.\" The problem<br />\nbecame a serious emergency when a<br />\nHopkins undergraduate, while exploring<br />\nthe ruins one day, fell into a mass of<br />\nteaming rats and was devoured within<br />\nseconds.<br /><br />\nAdministration officials decided to<br />\ndestroy the building immediately. Within<br />\na few days of the demolition, eager<br />\nstudents of the Archeology Department<br />\nwere combing the area for relics of the<br />\npast. The first discoveries were fairly<br />\nrecent--plastic ID cards, old-fashioned<br />\n\"lacrosse balls\" and a primitive electronics game. Then a first-year graduate<br />\nstudent stumbled over a plastic nameplate<br />\nbearing the words, \"Chris Colombo.\"<br />\nThe nameplate, now authenticated by<br />\nseveral prominent archeologists, has made<br />\nseveral important historical contributions.<br />\nFirst, the proof that Christopher<br />\nColumbus did journey to Baltimore in<br />\none of his later voyages seems incontrovertible. Secondly, archeologists were<br />\nsurprised to discover that plastic seems to<br />\nhave been invented in the 15th century.<br /><br />\nber of any ethnic or racial group other<br />\nthan Scottish or Afro-American. The<br />\nrecord clearly shows that collegeeducated applicants have met with a<br />\nstone wall here, too, except for a brief<br />\ninflux of Marxist graduate students back<br />\nin the early '80s. The net effect of the<br />\nUniversity's hiring and tenure practices<br />\nhas been to create what some view as a<br />\ndismaying homogeneity of the plant-op<br />\nstaff.<br />\n\"I don't like to be the one to say<br />\nit, but it seems to me that there's mischief in the machine shop, so to speak,\"<br />\nsaid Dr. David Harvey, Gadfly Professor<br />\nEmeritus of Geography and Environmental Electioneering. \"Too often, the<br />\nwhite affluent student in Wolman or<br />\nMcCoy who has complained about<br />\nroaches or a stopped W.C. has had the<br />\nexperience of dealing with a seemingly<br />\npoor, oppressed, and ethnic repairman.<br />\nWhile this fosters a healthy sense of<br />\nmiddle-class guilt in the student, I feel<br />\nnevertheless that the plant-op people<br />\nshould be ashamed of themselves. Everyone knows they earn more than the<br />\nprofessors do.\"<br />\nHarvey has been an outspoken<br />\ncritic of plant-op and the powerful Johns<br />\nHopkins Employees Association (JHEA)<br />\nsince they sabotaged his attempt to<br />\nunionize the faculty here last year.<br />\nOf course, Harvey's view is just<br />\none side of the coin. Admininstration<br />\nofficials adamantly maintain that all<br />\ndecisions pursuant to plant operations<br />\nhave been made with absolute fairness<br />\nin the pure and unsullied atmosphere of<br />\nacademia, subject to no undue pressures,<br />\ninfluences, or monies exchanged with the<br />\nFederal Regulatory Commission on Hiring Practices.<br />\n\"We adamantly maintain that all<br />\ndecisions pursuant to plant-op have been<br />\nmade with absolute fairness in the pure<br />\nand unsullied atmosphere of academia,<br />\nsubject to no undue pressures, influences<br />\nor monies exchanged with the Federal<br />\nRegulatory Commission on Hiring Practices,\" adamantly maintained Anna Suskind, Hereditary Dean of the Arts and<br />\nSciences. \"Not only that, but we're<br />\nkeeping a complete dossier on anyone<br />\nwho thinks otherwise.\"<br />\nSuskind's sentiments were fervently echoed by Dr. David Newman,Dean of<br />\nAll He Surveys.\"They don't have a case,\"<br />\nfervently echoed Newman, who conceded<br />\nlater that he wasn't sure which particular<br />\ncontroversial situation was being discussed.<br />\nIs there discrimination at Hopkins<br />\nplant-op? We would like to answer that<br />\nquestion by presenting the results of an<br />\nelaborate nine-month research project,<br />\ninvolving interviews with deans, faculty,<br />\ntrustees, students, plant-op staffers themselves, and reviews of case-transcripts,<br />\nsalary-graphs, and personnel reports.<br />\nUnfortunately, no one had time for all<br />\ntat, so we sent a freshman over to talk to<br />\nJohn Henry Jefferson, a tenured groundslot of<br />\nkeeper who reputedly pulls<br />\nstrings at the monthly Handyman and<br />\nFaculty Council meetings.<br /><br />\nscious Humor in the Liberal Arts Department. \"We'd have had to pick up on<br />\nany breakdown of fair procedure with an<br />\nimmediate clean-up operation, as it is our<br />\nduty to maintain equity. But obviously<br />\nthere were no grounds for such sweeping<br />\ncharges. Excuse me while I repair to my<br />\nstudy.\"<br />\nFurther coverage of the plantoperations tenure question seems unlikely, but our next issue will deal in<br />\ndepth with the question of secretarial<br />\npower on the Board of Trustees, including an interview with Dean Mareck on<br />\n\"Freeing the Eisenhower Six.\"<br /><br />\nDean Dean Dean<br />\nPresident Charles Keenan announced this week that the following administration appointment and changes in<br />\nschedules and titles were made this week.<br />\nFormer Associate Dean of Special<br />\nHomewood Services and Activities,<br />\nWilliam Dean, has been promoted to full<br />\ndeanship of the Homewood Faculty of<br />\nArts. Dean Dean expressed his reaction<br />\nto the promotion in his elegant pithy<br />\nmanner, \"Gee whiz, I think that this<br />\nchange is just swell. I mean,I was talking<br />\nto Dina, my wife last night, about my<br />\nconcern that our son Dean, wasn't getting<br />\na broad enough education here at my<br />\nalma mater. Now that I'm in charge of<br />\nthe Liberal Arts program I can assure<br />\nDean the education he needs to be as<br />\nsuccessful as I am.\" Dean will move his<br />\noffice to the Aldous Huxley executive<br />\nsuite of the Liberal Arts Department<br />\nwhere he will hold business hours from<br />\n1-5 Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The<br />\nappointment includes a decrease both in<br />\nduties and in pay.<br />\nAssistant Associate Dean of<br />\nHomewood Public Relations and SmoothTalking Steven Viggiani has been promoted to Associate Dean of Speical Homewood Services and Activities. Viggiani<br />\nwill share the post recently vacated by<br />\nDean with Jack Lu. The two will serve on<br />\nalternating days of the week and will split<br />\nDean's salary between them. Viggiani's<br />\nduties will entail supervision of the<br />\ncampus social activities; Lu will supervise<br />\nsocial services and interactions. When<br />\nasked to remark on his promotion,<br />\nViggiani said, \"Wow, it's fantastic!!!<br />\nWhat a great opportunity to keep my<br />\nswivel well greased. I mean,I get to go to<br />\nall the dances on campus and twist the<br />\nnight away!\" His last words were lost as<br />\nhe spun off to his next affair. Lu could<br />\nnot be reached for comment.<br /><br />\nAmiable Andy<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office released<br />\nthis week its schedule of activities for<br />\nthe '01-'02 academic year. According<br />\nto cheerful chaplain Andrew \"Andy\"<br />\nCoe, many of the planned events will<br />\ncontinue the tradition established by<br />\nthe Office years ago.<br />\n\"Andy's Place\", the Wednesday-night entertainment spot will continue to offer quality live entertainment and<br />\nrefreshments - all for a nominal $20<br />\nentrance donation, the proceeds of which<br />\ngo towards supplies for the Chaplain's<br />\ntutorial project. The line-up includes<br />\nDave Newman, professional impersonator<br />\nof Elvis, the famous 1980's rock star<br />\nwho died mysteriously in his secluded<br />\nMersy estate, Clubland, in 1995.<br />\nOld-timer Pat Ercolano will again grace<br />\nthe stage of the Little Ampitheatre with<br />\nsuch easy-listening golden oldies as \"Johnny B.

An<br />\nextensive search of the Archives, kept on<br />\nF level of the library, proved no such<br />\nrecord exists. So it is likely that the<br />\nUniversity will begin to build up, instead<br />\nof out. Lu said \"If only we'd known this<br />\nwhen we added E through 11 levels to the<br />\nlibrary.\"<br />\nLu also announced that the<br />\nLiberal Arts Department would be moved<br />\nfrom the fourth floor of Gilman Hall to<br />\nthe Gatehouse (formerly the office for a<br />\nstudent newspaper).

The yellow stains have led<br />\nsome scientists to believe that the basin<br />\nwas used as a receptacle for yellowed<br />\ntumors removed in primitive brain<br />\nsurgery. Other believe that cooks used<br />\nthem to wash vegetables. One professor<br />\nfrom Stanford claims that the letter 's' in<br />\n`sloan' is really a dollar sign, and should<br />\nthus be read as \"Sloan.\" According to our<br />\nrecords of student rituals, during times of<br />\neconomic despair a student would consume large amounts of alcohol and then<br />\npray to the \"loan\" idols for monetary aid.<br />\nsideline, and a burden to this University.\"<br />\nAt this, both professors of the Liberal<br />\nArts department walked out.

In that<br />\nsuit, University attorneys argued that the<br />\nlease for the park only applied to the<br />\nsurface, and not the space below the<br /><br />\nsurface. The fact that this defense was<br />\nsuccessful before nearly guarantees its<br />\nsuccess now.<br />\nIt is interesting to recall that at<br />\none time there was no Liberal Arts<br />\nDepartment. Before its formation in<br />\n1993, there were many different departments which taught various facets of the<br />\nliberal arts: Political Science, Humanities, Writing Seminars(?), Anthropology,<br />\nand even an entire department for History. Most of these departments were<br />\nphased out before the formation of<br />\nthe Liberal Arts Department. A University spokesman said at the time, \"After<br />\nall, what is this University for?

This guy<br />\nshould sure do the job.\"<br />\nThe new guy is pitcher C.C.<br /><br />\nPentax, whose brilliant high school career<br />\nand unblemished academic record set<br />\nBabb on his trail three years ago. According to coach Babb, \"C.C. has all the<br />\nmoves.\"<br />\nPentax's fastball has been clocked<br />\nat 345 m.p.h. But Babb says the fastball<br /><br />\nis Pentax's weakness. \"I signed him for<br />\nhis slider,\" said Babb. \"Last week at<br />\nDundalk High, he struck out four R-2<br />\nunits, a Xerox-07 and a Word Processor,<br />\nall on sliders. I figure Pentax will put<br />\nus back in competition in the Middle<br />\nAutomatic Conference.\"<br />\nWhen asked how he felt about<br />\ncoming to Hopkins for his undergraduate<br />\neducation, Pentax said, \"Zrfltt!

Several scouts were sizing<br />\nPentax up as a possible recruit for the<br />\nNew York Yankees. But apparently the<br />\npro scouts decided to see how well the<br />\nyoung pitcher could do in college ball<br /><br />\nfirst.<br />\nPentax can pitch right-handed,<br />\nleft-handed, side-armed, and underhanded, separately or all at one time. \"lie's<br />\nthe only pitcher I've ever seen that can<br />\nstrike someone out by simultaneously<br />\nhurling three balls over the plate,\u2014 said<br />\nBabb.<br />\nPentax's debut performance as a<br />\nBlue Jay is Friday, May 8, when Hopkins<br />\nhosts Westinghouse.

He assembles faces and bodies<br />\ninfluenced his art. Bearden's collages from irregular pieces of cloth, colored<br />\nrepresent a unique vision of people and paper, and magazine illustrations. There<br />\nsetting from the black cultural milieux is no attempt to blend the magazine<br />\ncutouts into a seamless montage--they are<br />\nobstrusive, and quite expressive. Features<br />\nhacked out of several different faces are<br />\npieced together like fragments of broken<br />\nchina doll, hands fit bodies awkwardly,<br />\nand photographic cutouts unexpectedly<br />\nappear in otherwise stylized figures.<br />\nBearden seems to attack his<br />\ncollage materials and apply them to the<br />\nsurface in fits of expression. Rough-hewn<br />\nblocks of illustrational foliage, ranging<br />\nfrom magnified blades of grass to anal<br />\nviews of forest, fit together to form an<br />\nopen field in Sunset Limited. Farewell<br />\nEugene and The Street employ denselypacked collage elements to create microcosms of faces, figures, and buildings.<br />\nSeveral collages contain gardens or woods<br />\ncomposed of jaggedly segmented pictures<br />\nof plants, flowers, trees, and animals.

Horizontal and<br />\nvertical divisions defined by walls, floors,<br />\nwindows, and horizons, slice the space<br />\ninto regions containing different colors<br />\nand forms. Bearden consistently contrasts areas given detail and activity by<br />\nmany small-collage additions with simple<br />\nmonochromatic area. The spontaneousyet-controlled quality of his collages, like<br />\ntheir overall visual style is analogous to<br />\nthe musical style ofjazz.<br />\nThe people Bearden depicts are<br />\nenclosed in their own private worlds.<br />\nFocusing on ordinary people, Bearden<br />\nconstructs fanciful personal worlds<br />\naround them, letting the thoughts and<br />\ndreams he imagines they have transform<br />\ntheir surroundings.

A<br />\ngarden becomes a magical domain, a<br />\nbedroom a chamber where dreams<br />\ncondense on the walls.
