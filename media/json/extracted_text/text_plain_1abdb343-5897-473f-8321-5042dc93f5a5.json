The general trend<br />\nof the article conveyed the impression<br />\nthat no such International Club existed<br />\nthroughout the Johns Hopkins<br />\nInstitutions and I therefore would like<br />\nthe opportunity to erase any<br />\nmisconceptions that may have arisen<br />\nfollowing the publication of the latter<br />\narticle.<br />\nIn 1959 an International Club was<br />\nestablished at the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nInstitutions. This club was formed for the<br />\nexpress purpose of welcoming foreign<br />\npre- and post-doctoral students or faculty<br />\nmembers to the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nInstitutions, and also to help them in<br />\nvarious aspects of settlement in the<br />\nBaltimore area. The activities of the club<br />\n<br />\nWhite House<br />\nemergency squad<br />\n<br />\nhousing survey<br />\nAPO's attempt to survey student housing will not just<br />\nbe enough to help student housing.

The statistics will<br />\nbe openfor use by anybody who can use them, and<br />\nhopefully interested students, possibly with the help<br />\nof the University or groups like the Greater<br />\nHomewood Community Corporation, will study<br />\nhousing code violations to force landlords into<br />\nimproving housing conditions and fostering better<br />\nrelations between off-campus students and their<br />\nresidents.<br />\nThe service fraternity's suggestion for<br />\nguaranteed-leases is an even better way for the<br />\nUniversity to help students to find housing. Because<br />\nlandlords would have to ask the University to take part<br />\nin the guarantee agreement, the school would not have<br />\nto take over all student leases. Because the University<br />\nwould inspect all housing involved, students would be<br />\nassured that their landlords would treat them fairly.<br />\nAnd because the school would guarantee student<br />\nleases, landlords would be happy.<br />\n<br />\nFiddler on the Roof movie excels in ritual<br />\nBy HOWARD LEVENSON<br />\nMy mother suggested that I see<br />\n\"Fiddler on the Roof,\" not because she<br />\nthought I should see a wholesome movie<br />\nfor a change, but because \"That's how<br />\nyour grandparents lived.\"<br />\nSuperficially this seemed to be a<br />\nreasonable suggestion. Questions of<br />\ntechnique aside for a moment, a story<br />\nabout the Russian Jews at the beginning<br />\nof this century has a lot more to do with<br />\nmy background than does just about any<br />\nother movie ever made Time's up. In<br />\nthe hands of a good director, virtually<br />\nany subject can have a lot to do with<br />\nanyone's life. That's what art is supposed<br />\nto be about. Directors shouldn't have to<br />\nrely on ready-made audiences, one of<br />\nwhich, I suspect, accounts at least<br />\npartially for \"Fiddler's\" success at the<br />\nbox office. (Many Jews seem to feel<br />\nseethe tl1CNIAr\u2022<br />\nas if it Wf.1.e<br />\ntobligaed<br />\nsome sort of religious rite) It seems fair<br />\naVrector Norman<br />\nto ask tiomi we<br />\n<br />\nmakes a three-hour-long movie, he must<br />\nhave something more ambitious in mind.<br />\nAnd Jewison does, indeed, have a big<br />\nstory to tell: how the Russian Jews lived,<br />\nand how their lives were changing from<br />\nwithin and were torn apart from without<br />\nby pogroms and exile.<br />\nThe movie focuses on Tevye (played<br />\nby Topol), the milkman of the village of<br />\nAnatevka, and his wife Golda (Norma<br />\nCrane), who have five daughters to marry<br />\noff. The daughters acquire husbands in<br />\nsuccessively less conventional ways. Then<br />\nthreats by the Tzar's men culminate in<br />\nthe decree that the Jews must leave their<br />\nhomes.<br />\nThe movie does a much better job with<br />\nritual and intense emotion than with<br />\nhumor and day-to-day living.<br />\nMany scenes of joy and optimism,<br />\nbewilderment and reflection, sorrow and<br />\nresignation are deeply realized. The<br />\nactors are at their best here, and so is<br />\newison: although most of the emotional<br />\n<br />\nthings are much too antisepticized.<br />\nSurely lives replete with poverty and<br />\ntragedy had some smaller inconveniences,<br />\ntoo. But it seems as if the people of<br />\nAnatevka never ached or sweated or<br />\nsmelled or found it a pain in the ass to<br />\nget to the synagogue twice a day. One of<br />\nthe few exceptions comes when Tevye<br />\nand the town butcher, both drunk, lean<br />\nagainst one another in great, coarse gasps<br />\nof laughter.<br />\n<br />\nare those depicting Jewish rituals.<br />\nConsciousness of the \"set up\" quality of<br />\nthese scenes fades away completely, since<br />\nthe stylization seems to flow not from<br />\nthe director's orders, but from the<br />\ndictates of Judaism itself. Golda's hands<br />\nmake circles in the air above the Sabbath<br />\ncandles in \"Sabbath Prayer\" and the<br />\ncandlelight procession to the wedding<br />\ncanopy in \"Sunrise, Sunset\" become<br />\netched on one's mind.<br />\nUnfortunately, almost every light<br />\nmoment in the movie is very forgettable,<br />\nand consequently, the fabric of life in<br />\nAnatevka is full of holes. Jewison tries to<br />\nshow everyone's place in the town's<br />\nday-to-day routine in \"tradition,\" the<br />\nfirst big production number. It is a<br />\ndreadful effort, featuring big, splashy<br />\n(and tasteless) cuts around the inside of a<br />\ns-ynagogue.

Many things<br />\nin her life went wrong,<br />\nbut she was always able to prevent things from going seriously wrong. She<br />\ncould expand and contract, rise and fall, set things back on the right track<br />\nWith a pendulum constancy. Affairs of the heart were not difficult for her<br />\nto handle, and she had little sympathy for people who could not solve their<br />\nproblems with equally quick dispatch. Irate lovers would threaten to break<br />\nher, but she would merely run off laughing or slap these excitable men on<br />\ntheir wrists like an exasperated child. She didn't like to be smothered, and<br />\nshe didn't like things to go on too long and become boring. She took vows<br />\nthat she would never allow herself to become bored, and so far she had no<br />\ntrouble in keeping them.<br />\nCompliments came to her often; her favorites were<br />\n\"beautiful\" and \"wild\". If she thought very hard, she could remember that<br />\nthese two paeans were given her on quite separate occasions, but she liked to<br />\nthink of them as a single entity, as if she were a huntress, a beautiful and wild \u2022<br />\nhuntress. At gatherings of intellectuals, when the subject of religion inevitably<br />\ncame up, she would throw back her beautiful head with its carefully<br />\ndisarrayed mane of tawny hair and declare to all that her god was Diana. This<br />\nalways brought chuckles and shrieks of incredulity, but Sheila was not joking;<br />\nshe did worship Diana devoutly, and much of what she did in life was in<br />\ntribute to the goddess of the hunt. She knew other strange girls who wore<br />\nleathers and feathers and beads and who worshipped such figures of the<br />\noccult as witches and succubi, but she considered this to be crude and rather<br />\nugly. She always said that she preferred brightness to gloom, love to evil, the<br />\nchase to the kill. Often she took time off from her studies to research her<br />\nfavorite goddess, and before long she had become an expert on the habits and<br />\nachievements of the Huntress.<br />\nIn Bellemore Gardens, the off-campus building in<br />\nWhich she lived, worked Officer Elroy Mackintosh, a night guard who smiled<br />\neasily, was not overly bright, and had red hair, eyebrows and freckles. Miriam,<br />\nSheila's neighbor, thought he was cute, but Sheila disagreed. In the first place,<br />\nhe was too old to be cute, probably thirty-five or six, and he looked a bit<br />\nbattered when closely viewed. Furthermore, he was an inch shorter than she<br />\nwas and a bit lumpy in physique, and, most significantly, he had once seen<br />\nher reading Edith Hamilton and asked her who she was. This she considered<br />\ncretinous. He did, however, smoke a pipe, which struck her as being rather<br />\ndistinguished for a man in his station of life. Also, he had two interesting<br />\nscars, a short jagged one beneath his right ear and a slim, conch-colored one<br />\nbisecting his left eyebrow. She adored men with scars, and so, for amusement,<br />\nshe began to direct her interest towards Officer Mackintosh, giving him a<br />\nwarm greeting whenever she saw him and shaking his hand when she departed<br />\nfor extended weekends. He responded enthusiastically and began to spend<br />\ntime in the vicinity of her apartment, waiting for her to appear during the<br />\nlong nights.<br />\nOnce she became fully aware of the little drama<br />\ngoing on between them, she appeared more and more frequently during<br />\nOfficer Mackintosh's night-time tour of duty. Small gifts and favors were<br />\nexchanged: Elroy helped her open a stubborn bedroom window, and Sheila<br />\nmade _coffee and hot-cross buns for them. She found Elroy to be a constant.<br />\nsource of amusement, and she enjoyed studying his awkward conduct and<br />\n<br />\nbellemore gardens<br />\n<br />\noutre manners. He never stayed long (there was, after all, his job and his<br />\n<br />\nfumbling shyness), but his visits were frequent. Miriam took to peeking<br />\nthrough the peephole of her door whenever she heard movement in the hall,<br />\nand she always ran quickly to Sheila's apartment when Elroy had left. She<br />\nasked many questions, but she ironed Sheila's blouses for her and so Sheila<br />\nfelt compelled to be civil.<br />\n\"What's been going on in here?\" Miriam asked.<br />\n\"Just tea, dear. Very innocent.\"<br />\nMiriam laughed a bit; Sheila was so wonderful, so<br />\ncool and wicked. \"Just what is this strange attachment you have to Officer<br />\nMackintosh, Sheila?\"<br />\nSheila put down her book, and thought for a<br />\nmoment. \"I fascinate him. Yes, I fascinate him,\" and her lips drew up into<br />\na smile.<br />\n***<br />\n<br />\nBy the third week of their acquaintance, Sheila<br />\nallowed Officer Mackintosh to kiss the upper regions of her breasts. This<br />\nwas a new experience for him; he had fondled whores but never a girl like<br />\nthis. He was one of those men who had forgotten about a large portion of<br />\nlife; living with a sick mother who had diabetes and an amputation of the<br />\nleg, he had all he could handle in finding and keeping jobs. There were<br />\nmany: a prodigious state as a salesman for a fertilizer manufacturer which<br />\nended in shame and humiliation at a disastrously botched order, a<br />\nsuccessful stint as manager of an egg hatchery which unfortunately went<br />\nbankrupt, a misguided foray into the world of computer technology, an<br />\nice-cream vendor in a downtown business district, and now a tiring life as a<br />\nstock boy in a department store by day and a guard by night. There had<br />\nnever been any hopes for great success: he had neither the brains, the<br />\npersonality, nor the drive. But things had turned out rather worse than<br />\nexpected, and, now that his mother was dead, there were moments of great<br />\ndismalness and loss. Mother had not been an ideal companion, but as long<br />\nas he remembered to bring home a pint of sugar-free strawberry ice cream<br />\neach night, she was a docile and reassuring presence.<br />\nSheila had become the bright part of his life, an<br />\nincredibly brilliant and splendid jewel in the grey-brown which surrounded<br />\nhim. When he awoke in the morning, he thought first of her, and so it was<br />\nwhen he went to bed. He desired her, he wanted to sleep with her, he<br />\nloved her, he worshipped her, he admired her, he wanted to spend the rest<br />\nof his life with her. No such dreams had ever before occurred to him for he<br />\nreally did not admit to himself that other people were leading lives of<br />\ngreater worth, filled with wives and children and family. Now, having found<br />\nSheila, he painfully realized how complete a void his life was, and he set<br />\nout to correct it. There were many things to be done: a visit to the<br />\nbarbershop where his hair was parted in a different direction, having his car<br />\nsimonized and waxed, buying one of those brightly-colored polka-dot shirts<br />\nwhich he had sworn he would never wear. It didn't matter that Sheila<br />\nnoticed none of it; he wasn't doing all this for her appreciation, but,<br />\nrather, to raise himself to her level. Her lack of interest did not offend himnothing she did could annoy or disturb him in any way. True, it was<br />\npainful to see her going off on weekends with other men, but he figured<br />\nthis would stop in time. Sometimes, though, it was terrible: recently he had<br />\n<br />\n\f(continued from page 1)<br />\n<br />\nher door at midnight (their usual time) and she<br />\npresented herself all flushed with her clothes out of<br />\norder. \"Oh, Elroy!\" she cried, half-laughing,<br />\nhalf-scolding, and a young bearded man whom<br />\nElroy knew he could break like a twig came to the<br />\ndoor and said \"Who's your friend?\" Elroy excused<br />\nhimself quickly and hid for shame in the dark part<br />\nof the hall for a few moments. When he awoke the<br />\nnext morning their laughter still echoed in his ears.<br />\nBut she couldn't have known because she could<br />\nnever hurt anyone intentionally, he was sure of<br />\nthat at least.<br />\nSometimes he thought<br />\nshe didn't care: she would open the door, \"Too<br />\nbusy\" she would say brusquely, and vanish in an<br />\ninstant. Yet, other times she was warm and<br />\nsoft and cuddly. They would exchange little<br />\nkisses and sometimes big kisses and there was that<br />\none time when he felt her upper breast and kissed<br />\nit. It was soft, like the wallet his mother had once<br />\ngiven him for his birthday; he would like to have<br />\nbeen able to express it better but that's what it felt<br />\nlike to him.One Saturday in early March, he came<br />\nby Bellemore Gardens and asked Sheila if she<br />\nwouls take a walk with him. She was annoyed- he<br />\nshould have called- but Elroy persisted and whined<br />\nso that she gave in. It was a beautiful day- the first<br />\nwarm sun of the year- and he wanted to share it<br />\nwith her. He knew alot about nature (he picked it<br />\nup while he worked at the egg hatchery,away from<br />\nthe city, down green country roads), and he<br />\nwanted to tell her all about it. lie told her the<br />\nnames of the trees, how to tell one kind of grass<br />\nfrom another, where the flowers would come up<br />\nlater in the spring. \"I know what a maple tree is!\"<br />\nshe cried, and he asked her what the difference was<br />\nbetween a Norwegian and a Japanese maple and<br />\nshe pouted and he laughed. It was wonderful. Even<br />\nwhen she made a face and cried \"You're so boring,<br />\nElroy!\" it was wonderful. Soon she became tired<br />\nand cold and her feet were damp, so they cut their<br />\nwalk short and retired to her apartment. Before<br />\nthey went in, Elroy turned his face upward and<br />\nsmiled happily. \"I love the sun,\" he said, and she<br />\ntold him how she hated it and lived for the moon<br />\nand went out at odd hours with almost nothing on<br />\nto take moonbaths. He was shocked and told her<br />\nso, which made her both angry and amused, and<br />\nshe made him apologize twice before they went<br />\nback in.<br />\n***<br />\n<br />\nShe ate an orange and<br />\nwatched him through the peephole of her door as<br />\nhe stood there waiting for a response to his anxious<br />\nknocking. \"Come!\" she cried to Miriam, waving<br />\nher over to her side. \"No, Sheila, it's cruel.

Opening the front door, she listened<br />\nquietly, making sure that everyone in the house<br />\nwas asleep before entering. Closing the door behind<br />\nher, she stepped out of her shoes, turned off the<br />\nlight in the hallway, and went upstairs to her room.<br />\nShe lay on her bed<br />\nwithout undressing. A fixture in the middle of the<br />\nceiling cast shadows into the corners and crevices<br />\nof the room. But Stephie, staring past the fixture<br />\nand the ceiling, saw only white light. She did not<br />\ncry. Rather water filled her eyes and drained past<br />\nher temples to become lost in her brown hair upon<br />\nthe pillow. The room was silence. She could hear<br />\nthe air move past her head. It seemed to be falling<br />\nover her.<br />\nIn the eye of the light she<br />\nsaw herself lying slightly chilled in Jeff's arms,<br />\nnaked, staring into his face with its features<br />\nshadowed and indistinguishable above her. Against<br />\nthis image she tried to order her thoughts, to calm<br />\nherself, and to make some sense out of the steamy<br />\nvapor filling her head.<br />\nThere was a time before<br />\nthis time, after they had met, when to be with Jeff<br />\nhad been to be separated with herself and him in a<br />\nworld unknown to those they knew, to parents<br />\ntrying and friends undefined in their relationships.<br />\nBefore meeting in the summer past, a year away,<br />\ntroubled with the ills of growing up, the afflictions<br />\nof self-awareness, in the same room crying and<br />\nearlier at the dinner table; parents then had been<br />\nno help. There had been no solace in<br />\nacquaintances. Young beauty, fifteen years old,<br />\nlong brown hair and deep eyes, tight shape and<br />\ncute face, solving nothing, answering nothing, but<br />\nmade the watery depressions at times seem normal,<br />\nas if, in being, a balance, a tepid bath, something<br />\nhumanizing and addicting. There had been no aid<br />\nfound in her bright wit or in the philosophies of<br />\nDad and older brother Otis. Points had been<br />\narrived at where thinking stopped. Something had<br />\nbeen comprehended but not understood,<br />\nsomething that would, that had, ripped insides and<br />\nstomach apart, a searing pain.<br />\nThe attempted insights,<br />\nefforts to include Jeff in some conclusion, all had<br />\ndrowned in a lack of knowing, inadequate<br />\nperceptions. He had had no place in them. Why try<br />\nto place him where he did not belong, to shroud<br />\nthe two of them in questions and fears, a blanket<br />\nof impotence? Other people were so many theatres<br />\nof encounter, movies from which to walk away<br />\nthrough doors swinging into light and day of<br />\ntogether with Jeff. Loneliness, at first defined by<br />\nhours away from him, had lost all form and<br />\nmeaning. Jeff was always behind and within<br />\neverything. Always and never- all of her time being<br />\nexisted only as he was, and he and she were<br />\nconstantly, even during the days between their<br />\ncoming together.<br />\nNow lying in bed,<br />\nconception of self past and future was but the<br />\npresent moment. Crying hard and trying<br />\ndesperately to stop, she rolled onto her stomach<br />\nand pushed the pillow into her face. Her insides<br />\ncrumbled. There would be no end to it until she<br />\nexhausted herself and fell asleep.<br />\nStill the blurred image of<br />\nJeffs .face staring down into her nakedness would<br />\nnot leave her even in the darkness of her pillow.<br />\nShe was shame.<br />\nIn one long sob<br />\nseparating from the girl in Jeff's arms, without<br />\nhaving to think or remember, she knew the two of<br />\nthem to be coming together, the boy holding the<br />\nnaked, shivering girl in his arms.<br />\nPage 4\u2014April 11, 1972<br />\n<br />\nThe beach at Leyland, so<br />\nfar from Taylor, but rides had still beeneasy.The<br />\nsummer hot and distant from friends, watching<br />\nthem in their games, playing with little boys of the;<br />\ntown and towns about.

Whole.<br />\nTraveling in the west, Otis was still away, but with<br />\nMa and Dad, the parks, Tetons ranging into<br />\nYellowstone, with bears and glimpses of boys in<br />\nthe campsites at night. To return and find Kathy so<br />\nswamped by the summer's tide, its ebb and flow,<br />\ncovering them all, only Jeff, bright sixteen, long<br />\nblond hair dripping to his shoulders, his eyes<br />\nbright, the sun bright sparkling into the water,<br />\nJeffs legs so strong standing there, all he girls<br />\nstaring at him, and he had ignored them all. He had<br />\nhad his own summer, working, saving, coming and<br />\ngoing when he pleased.

So<br />\nproud. Alone. Different. The luck of a ride home<br />\nwith him. The phone call. The dance. He had come<br />\nin and touched her before his presence could be<br />\nfelt, and talking they had said all that they wanted.<br />\nNothing, nothing at all. He shouted to leave and<br />\nwithout waiting for an answer had grabbed and<br />\npulled and they left the heavy dance into the cool<br />\nshadowed night. That night, the most romantic<br />\nthing that had ever happened, falling in love.<br />\nStephie's stomach found<br />\nanother shallow well deep within her and quickly<br />\ndrained it, pumping the hot water to her eyes, and<br />\nforcing tears into the soft darkness of her pillow.<br />\nBut her stomach kept on pumping even after there<br />\nwas nothing left, thumping with a dull ache that<br />\nechoed in her head. She rolled onto her back. The<br />\nlight caught her eyes and burned. Flying about her<br />\nhead, thoughts collided against each other and<br />\npainfully aginst the sides of her brain, until all she<br />\nknew was the pain, and then hatred, and then<br />\nnothing. And then she decided that she had had<br />\nenough.<br />\nShe got out of bed and<br />\ngroped her way across the room without pausing to<br />\ntry to gain some sense of balance, but rather<br />\npushing herself along over the floor and out into<br />\nthe hallway. She stopped moving in front of the<br />\nmirror in the bathroom and caught her image for<br />\nan instant- brown snarled hair, long crumpled,<br />\nred-blotched face, pulled puffed eyes, sick dying<br />\nlooking. She turned on the faucet. The ,water<br />\ncrashed into the sink basin. Pulling the mirror<br />\ntowards her, her image slid away, and she grasped a<br />\nbottle from the cabinet now opened in front of<br />\nher. The pain in her head and the ache in her<br />\nstomach began to organize themselves into a low<br />\nrhythm.Then they broke again. Stephie read the<br />\nlabel on the bottle but did not understand it. She<br />\nswallowed the bottle's twelve pills, blindly shoving<br />\nthem into her mouth two and three at a time, and<br />\nthen, with water cupped in her hands from the<br />\nstream falling from the faucet, pushing them down<br />\nher throat in long pressured gulps.<br />\nThe bottle emptied, the<br />\ncabinet closed, and the water turned off<br />\nsimultaneously. Stephie in a moment stood mind<br />\nblanked and stomach shocked staring into the<br />\nmirror, her eyes glazed and unseeing. Turning off<br />\nthe bathroom light, suddenly realizing herself to<br />\nbe drowning in exhaustion, she found her way<br />\nback to her bedroom. She pushed down the<br />\nswitch next to her door and undressed in the<br />\nlight from the hallway. Closing the door behind<br />\nher, she made her way in the darkness to her<br />\nbed.<br />\nKnees sliding toward her<br />\n<br />\nchest, mind starting to clear, trying with a final<br />\ndetermined, almost cold, attitude to discover if<br />\nwith Jeff it was love. Only love could justify what<br />\nthey- had become to each other. What was it? Love,<br />\nand yet it hurt so much, hurt with him all the time<br />\nnow, every time with him, almost every time, all<br />\nthe time, thinking of him, it hurt. But it must be<br />\nlove. What else but love? If it was, there was no<br />\nwant for it anymore, whatever need or loneliness.<br />\nOnly an ending. To be done.<br />\nThe pain in her head was<br />\nfuller now. It pressed everywhere against the sides<br />\nof her brain. In the center of her skull was heavy<br />\nmoist sand. The pill taste that lingered in her<br />\nmouth began dropping seeds of nausea into her<br />\nstomach. Stephie rolled onto her back and then<br />\nonto her side again. She was hot. Still, she held her<br />\nblankets to her and grabbed air into her mouth in<br />\ngulps.<br />\nThe first night together,<br />\nknowing, being ...too full for any one time or state.<br />\nBut it had been good, knowing what was<br />\nhappiness. At first only one night a weekend's<br />\nweek, catching the dance bus to Taylor. Meet and<br />\nwalk and do things. Nothing things. Just sit and<br />\ntalk and kiss and be together. Calls during the<br />\nweek. In the beginning there had been nights<br />\nwithout Jeff spent with friends. But friends had<br />\nbecome empty. Not really anything had been done<br />\nwith them in a long time. Not even shopping. Jeff<br />\nhad become so much. Jeff<br />\nWhat was there in<br />\ngoing out with Jeff? Where was the point?

I allowed as how I<br />\nhadn't, but, judging from their<br />\nenthusiasm, I sure would like to. As that<br />\n<br />\npoint, I really didn't know what to<br />\nexpect. This particular group of friends<br />\nwas very into mescaline and avant-gard<br />\njazz, and with a name like Commander<br />\nCody and his Lost Planet Airman and an<br />\nalbum title like Ozone, I anticipated the<br />\nwierdest. They didn't let me hear it that<br />\nnight, they waited until the next, after<br />\n<br />\nwe'd all knocked off a couple of Pabst<br />\nTall-Boys, and then they took out the<br />\nstrange looking cover and said \"Now,<br />\nlisten to this.\" Soon to emerge from the<br />\nspeakers was side 2, cut 1, \"Lost in the<br />\nOzone,\" surely one of scveetest,<br />\nsmoothest country-rock songs ever<br />\nrecorded.

The movie has great<br />\npower and style. It also has a series of<br />\nperformances that makes most of the<br />\n\"good\" movies around look like re-runs<br />\nof Petticoat Junction.<br />\nLike the Corleone family it portrays,<br />\nthe movie doesn't mess around. Variety<br />\nreported that the film made $7.5 million<br />\nin its first two weeks. Gone With the<br />\nWind, for example, has grossed a mere<br />\n$73 million since its original release in<br />\n1939. A better idea of the moolah<br />\ninvolved may be gleaned from this figure:<br />\nWoodstock has made only $13.5 million<br />\nsince its 1970 release. Within a few years,<br />\nindustry sources predict, Paramount<br />\nStudios, which made The Godfather, will<br />\nbe able to purchase the entire<br />\nmembership of the Mafia, thus ending<br />\norganized crime in America.<br />\nIn Baltimore, the film is playing most<br />\nconveniently at the Senator theatre,<br />\nwhere, as an indication of its eternal<br />\nengagement, the sidewalks surrounding<br />\nthe ever-crowded movie palace are etched<br />\nwith advertisements. The impact the film<br />\nhas had is also revealed in the surly<br />\nmanner of the ushers, who, in truth, have<br />\ntaken to wearing white silk ties on black<br />\nshirts.<br />\nThe film charts the power struggles of<br />\na major New York Mafia family in the<br />\nlate 1940's and early 1950's, along with<br />\n<br />\nanguishedl<br />\n<br />\nin emotional restraint in<br />\n<br />\nnear-fatal shooting, the death of a son<br />\nand the cruel process of aging. Brando<br />\nhas always been hailed for his ability to<br />\ninhabit a character, but here the<br />\ntranstormation is nothing short of<br />\nstunning. In fact, by this single role,<br />\nBrando single-handedly revises the<br />\nstandards we will expect of those who<br />\nplay hoodlums or the aged.<br />\nWe have forgotten just how good he<br />\ncan be. He had allowed his large talent to<br />\nbe contained in worthless films over the<br />\nlast 15 years, and for those born in the<br />\n1950's, his years of brilliance, Marlon<br />\nBrando was simply a washed-up figure<br />\nfrom the past. Now he is back, and we<br />\ncan understand why he is considered one<br />\nof the greatest actors in film history. He<br />\nis, quite simply, a delight to watch, and<br />\nthe other stars who have replaced him<br />\nhave not even come close to matching his<br />\nextraordinary talent.<br />\nBut Brando's performance is not caged<br />\nby shoddy supporting actors or poor<br />\nmaterial. Don Corleone's sons and<br />\nadversaries are superbly cast, and director<br />\nFrancis Ford Coppola has provided a<br />\nframework of tight editing, good pacing<br />\nand sharp dialogue to make this a totally<br />\nengrossing three-hour movie.<br />\nEspecially outstanding is Al Pacino's<br />\nrole as Michael Corleone, the Ivy League<br />\nwar-hero son who attempts to preserve<br />\nthe distance between himself and the<br />\nfamily business but ends up as his father's<br />\nsuccessor. The shooting of Don Corleone<br />\n<br />\ninexorably draws Michael into murder<br />\nand revenge, and Michael kills his soul in<br />\nthe process. It is an incredible change<br />\nthat comes over him, no less powerful<br />\nbecause of its gradual subtlety. The<br />\ninnocent, soft eyes go hard, the boyish<br />\nineptness shifts to a tough assurance, and.<br />\nMichael even picks up a few gestures<br />\nfrom his father. He learns in the end the<br />\ndark secrets of power, but at a price that<br />\nmay have been too great.<br />\nThe movie, as you may have read,<br />\nexcellently adapts the 400-plus pages of<br />\nthe novel, keeping in the essentials of the<br />\nplot and the characters. The movie isn't<br />\nreally better than the book, but it is more<br />\n<br />\noutstanding compared to other films than<br />\nthe novel is compared to other literature.<br />\nPublicity Heist?<br />\nThe impact of the movie is undeniable.<br />\nIn New York City, for example, a movie<br />\ntheatre showing the film was robbed of<br />\n$13,000 and the manager was shot in the<br />\narm. Reports indicated that those in line<br />\nthought that the heist was an elaborate<br />\npublicity stunt, and applauded the two<br />\nescaping robbers. Personally, I found<br />\nmyself slapping my girlfriend and<br />\nexhibiting a new toughness with<br />\ncandy-store owners. The film, in any<br />\ncase, is outstanding, and well worth the<br />\ntwo-week vigil on line.<br />\n<br />\nof gin/And it's back to the ozone again.<br />\nWe joined the Commander there that<br />\nnight with some cheap wine and a few<br />\nmore Tall-Boys which took us through<br />\nHot Rod Lincoln, Twenty-Flight Rock,<br />\nSeeds and Stems (Again), Annie, Wine Do<br />\nYer Stuff, Family Bible and other<br />\nfavorites.

Wickwire<br />\nsaid that there was a \"good<br />\npossibility\" that the course<br />\nwould be offered, but Hartman<br />\nnoted that the Biology<br />\ndepartment would also have to<br />\napprove the course.<br />\nA major point of contention<br />\nwas the status of the student<br />\nassistants in the juvenile<br />\ndelinquency course.

Under the Junior<br />\nStanding Program, however,<br />\nstudents are permitted to transfer<br />\nall their A.A. degree credits<br />\nprovided that their college has a<br />\ntransfer program.<br />\nOf the credit transfer, Dean<br />\nRoman J.

Guidelines for<br />\nnon-departmental teachers call<br />\nfor no more than one course per<br />\nsemester, but Zdanis said,<br />\n\"guidelines are not absolute<br />\nrules.\"<br />\nYesterday Zdanis said that for<br />\nhim an acceptable change in the<br />\nstatus of the assistants would<br />\nneed to include \"a completely<br />\nworked out list of assignments.\"<br />\nHe added, \"A large part of the<br />\nstudents' work is coordinating<br />\ntheir efforts with the needs of<br />\noutside institutions, so they have<br />\nto be supplied with background<br />\ninformation.\"<br />\nAssistants Issue<br />\nWickwire acknowledged, \"The<br />\nassistants have become an issue.<br />\nWe want to be as responsible as<br />\nanyone with what we offer, but I<br />\nthink we trust students more<br /><br />\nthan most people here are willing<br />\nto do.\"<br />\nWickwire said that he had been<br />\ntold yesterday after the meeting<br />\nof the Zdanis committee that a<br />\ncourse labeled \"Assistants in<br />\nJuvenile Delinquency Program\"<br />\nwould be listed in next semester's<br />\ncourse list. It is uncertain how<br />\nmuch credit will be offered or<br />\nwho will ,determine the<br />\nappropriate amount of credit. \"I<br />\nstill don't see the necessity to<br />\ncount that as a course, and<br />\ncalling it a course isn't going to<br />\nmake any difference in its<br />\nquality,\" said Wickwire.<br />\nAlthough Wickwire added that<br />\nhe would like to see a committee<br />\nthat \"would give us support,\"<br />\nZda n is pointed out that his<br />\ncommittee was not set up to<br />\nadvise the Chaplain's office.<br />\n\"We're not a Wickwire<br />\ncommittee,\" he said.

This club was formed for the<br />\nexpress purpose of welcoming foreign<br />\npre- and post-doctoral students or faculty<br />\nmembers to the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nInstitutions, and also to help them in<br />\nvarious aspects of settlement in the<br />\nBaltimore area. The activities of the club<br /><br />\nWhite House<br />\nemergency squad<br /><br />\nhousing survey<br />\nAPO's attempt to survey student housing will not just<br />\nbe enough to help student housing. Their compilation<br />\nof statistics might be helpful for students when they<br />\nbegin their annual search four housing each springtime<br />\nbut, of far greater worth, could bean interpretation of<br />\nthe facts and figures to show which landlords take<br />\nadvantage of undergraduate students with high rents,<br />\nslow repairs and low quality housing. The statistics will<br />\nbe openfor use by anybody who can use them, and<br />\nhopefully interested students, possibly with the help<br />\nof the University or groups like the Greater<br />\nHomewood Community Corporation, will study<br />\nhousing code violations to force landlords into<br />\nimproving housing conditions and fostering better<br />\nrelations between off-campus students and their<br />\nresidents.<br />\nThe service fraternity's suggestion for<br />\nguaranteed-leases is an even better way for the<br />\nUniversity to help students to find housing. Because<br />\nlandlords would have to ask the University to take part<br />\nin the guarantee agreement, the school would not have<br />\nto take over all student leases. Because the University<br />\nwould inspect all housing involved, students would be<br />\nassured that their landlords would treat them fairly.<br />\nAnd because the school would guarantee student<br />\nleases, landlords would be happy.<br /><br />\nFiddler on the Roof movie excels in ritual<br />\nBy HOWARD LEVENSON<br />\nMy mother suggested that I see<br />\n\"Fiddler on the Roof,\" not because she<br />\nthought I should see a wholesome movie<br />\nfor a change, but because \"That's how<br />\nyour grandparents lived.\"<br />\nSuperficially this seemed to be a<br />\nreasonable suggestion. Questions of<br />\ntechnique aside for a moment, a story<br />\nabout the Russian Jews at the beginning<br />\nof this century has a lot more to do with<br />\nmy background than does just about any<br />\nother movie ever made Time's up. In<br />\nthe hands of a good director, virtually<br />\nany subject can have a lot to do with<br />\nanyone's life. That's what art is supposed<br />\nto be about. Directors shouldn't have to<br />\nrely on ready-made audiences, one of<br />\nwhich, I suspect, accounts at least<br />\npartially for \"Fiddler's\" success at the<br />\nbox office.

The daughters acquire husbands in<br />\nsuccessively less conventional ways. Then<br />\nthreats by the Tzar's men culminate in<br />\nthe decree that the Jews must leave their<br />\nhomes.<br />\nThe movie does a much better job with<br />\nritual and intense emotion than with<br />\nhumor and day-to-day living.<br />\nMany scenes of joy and optimism,<br />\nbewilderment and reflection, sorrow and<br />\nresignation are deeply realized. The<br />\nactors are at their best here, and so is<br />\newison: although most of the emotional<br /><br />\nthings are much too antisepticized.<br />\nSurely lives replete with poverty and<br />\ntragedy had some smaller inconveniences,<br />\ntoo. But it seems as if the people of<br />\nAnatevka never ached or sweated or<br />\nsmelled or found it a pain in the ass to<br />\nget to the synagogue twice a day. One of<br />\nthe few exceptions comes when Tevye<br />\nand the town butcher, both drunk, lean<br />\nagainst one another in great, coarse gasps<br />\nof laughter.<br /><br />\nare those depicting Jewish rituals.<br />\nConsciousness of the \"set up\" quality of<br />\nthese scenes fades away completely, since<br />\nthe stylization seems to flow not from<br />\nthe director's orders, but from the<br />\ndictates of Judaism itself. Golda's hands<br />\nmake circles in the air above the Sabbath<br />\ncandles in \"Sabbath Prayer\" and the<br />\ncandlelight procession to the wedding<br />\ncanopy in \"Sunrise, Sunset\" become<br />\netched on one's mind.<br />\nUnfortunately, almost every light<br />\nmoment in the movie is very forgettable,<br />\nand consequently, the fabric of life in<br />\nAnatevka is full of holes. Jewison tries to<br />\nshow everyone's place in the town's<br />\nday-to-day routine in \"tradition,\" the<br />\nfirst big production number.

Many things<br />\nin her life went wrong,<br />\nbut she was always able to prevent things from going seriously wrong. She<br />\ncould expand and contract, rise and fall, set things back on the right track<br />\nWith a pendulum constancy. Affairs of the heart were not difficult for her<br />\nto handle, and she had little sympathy for people who could not solve their<br />\nproblems with equally quick dispatch. Irate lovers would threaten to break<br />\nher, but she would merely run off laughing or slap these excitable men on<br />\ntheir wrists like an exasperated child. She didn't like to be smothered, and<br />\nshe didn't like things to go on too long and become boring. She took vows<br />\nthat she would never allow herself to become bored, and so far she had no<br />\ntrouble in keeping them.<br />\nCompliments came to her often; her favorites were<br />\n\"beautiful\" and \"wild\". If she thought very hard, she could remember that<br />\nthese two paeans were given her on quite separate occasions, but she liked to<br />\nthink of them as a single entity, as if she were a huntress, a beautiful and wild \u2022<br />\nhuntress. At gatherings of intellectuals, when the subject of religion inevitably<br />\ncame up, she would throw back her beautiful head with its carefully<br />\ndisarrayed mane of tawny hair and declare to all that her god was Diana. This<br />\nalways brought chuckles and shrieks of incredulity, but Sheila was not joking;<br />\nshe did worship Diana devoutly, and much of what she did in life was in<br />\ntribute to the goddess of the hunt. She knew other strange girls who wore<br />\nleathers and feathers and beads and who worshipped such figures of the<br />\noccult as witches and succubi, but she considered this to be crude and rather<br />\nugly. She always said that she preferred brightness to gloom, love to evil, the<br />\nchase to the kill. Often she took time off from her studies to research her<br />\nfavorite goddess, and before long she had become an expert on the habits and<br />\nachievements of the Huntress.<br />\nIn Bellemore Gardens, the off-campus building in<br />\nWhich she lived, worked Officer Elroy Mackintosh, a night guard who smiled<br />\neasily, was not overly bright, and had red hair, eyebrows and freckles. Miriam,<br />\nSheila's neighbor, thought he was cute, but Sheila disagreed. In the first place,<br />\nhe was too old to be cute, probably thirty-five or six, and he looked a bit<br />\nbattered when closely viewed. Furthermore, he was an inch shorter than she<br />\nwas and a bit lumpy in physique, and, most significantly, he had once seen<br />\nher reading Edith Hamilton and asked her who she was. This she considered<br />\ncretinous. He did, however, smoke a pipe, which struck her as being rather<br />\ndistinguished for a man in his station of life. Also, he had two interesting<br />\nscars, a short jagged one beneath his right ear and a slim, conch-colored one<br />\nbisecting his left eyebrow. She adored men with scars, and so, for amusement,<br />\nshe began to direct her interest towards Officer Mackintosh, giving him a<br />\nwarm greeting whenever she saw him and shaking his hand when she departed<br />\nfor extended weekends. He responded enthusiastically and began to spend<br />\ntime in the vicinity of her apartment, waiting for her to appear during the<br />\nlong nights.<br />\nOnce she became fully aware of the little drama<br />\ngoing on between them, she appeared more and more frequently during<br />\nOfficer Mackintosh's night-time tour of duty. Small gifts and favors were<br />\nexchanged: Elroy helped her open a stubborn bedroom window, and Sheila<br />\nmade _coffee and hot-cross buns for them. She found Elroy to be a constant.<br />\nsource of amusement, and she enjoyed studying his awkward conduct and<br /><br />\nbellemore gardens<br /><br />\noutre manners. He never stayed long (there was, after all, his job and his<br /><br />\nfumbling shyness), but his visits were frequent. Miriam took to peeking<br />\nthrough the peephole of her door whenever she heard movement in the hall,<br />\nand she always ran quickly to Sheila's apartment when Elroy had left. She<br />\nasked many questions, but she ironed Sheila's blouses for her and so Sheila<br />\nfelt compelled to be civil.<br />\n\"What's been going on in here?\" Miriam asked.<br />\n\"Just tea, dear. Very innocent.\"<br />\nMiriam laughed a bit; Sheila was so wonderful, so<br />\ncool and wicked. \"Just what is this strange attachment you have to Officer<br />\nMackintosh, Sheila?\"<br />\nSheila put down her book, and thought for a<br />\nmoment. \"I fascinate him. Yes, I fascinate him,\" and her lips drew up into<br />\na smile.<br />\n***<br /><br />\nBy the third week of their acquaintance, Sheila<br />\nallowed Officer Mackintosh to kiss the upper regions of her breasts. This<br />\nwas a new experience for him; he had fondled whores but never a girl like<br />\nthis. He was one of those men who had forgotten about a large portion of<br />\nlife; living with a sick mother who had diabetes and an amputation of the<br />\nleg, he had all he could handle in finding and keeping jobs. There were<br />\nmany: a prodigious state as a salesman for a fertilizer manufacturer which<br />\nended in shame and humiliation at a disastrously botched order, a<br />\nsuccessful stint as manager of an egg hatchery which unfortunately went<br />\nbankrupt, a misguided foray into the world of computer technology, an<br />\nice-cream vendor in a downtown business district, and now a tiring life as a<br />\nstock boy in a department store by day and a guard by night. There had<br />\nnever been any hopes for great success: he had neither the brains, the<br />\npersonality, nor the drive. But things had turned out rather worse than<br />\nexpected, and, now that his mother was dead, there were moments of great<br />\ndismalness and loss. Mother had not been an ideal companion, but as long<br />\nas he remembered to bring home a pint of sugar-free strawberry ice cream<br />\neach night, she was a docile and reassuring presence.<br />\nSheila had become the bright part of his life, an<br />\nincredibly brilliant and splendid jewel in the grey-brown which surrounded<br />\nhim. When he awoke in the morning, he thought first of her, and so it was<br />\nwhen he went to bed. He desired her, he wanted to sleep with her, he<br />\nloved her, he worshipped her, he admired her, he wanted to spend the rest<br />\nof his life with her. No such dreams had ever before occurred to him for he<br />\nreally did not admit to himself that other people were leading lives of<br />\ngreater worth, filled with wives and children and family. Now, having found<br />\nSheila, he painfully realized how complete a void his life was, and he set<br />\nout to correct it. There were many things to be done: a visit to the<br />\nbarbershop where his hair was parted in a different direction, having his car<br />\nsimonized and waxed, buying one of those brightly-colored polka-dot shirts<br />\nwhich he had sworn he would never wear. It didn't matter that Sheila<br />\nnoticed none of it; he wasn't doing all this for her appreciation, but,<br />\nrather, to raise himself to her level. Her lack of interest did not offend himnothing she did could annoy or disturb him in any way. True, it was<br />\npainful to see her going off on weekends with other men, but he figured<br />\nthis would stop in time. Sometimes, though, it was terrible: recently he had<br /><br />\n(continued from page 1)<br /><br />\nher door at midnight (their usual time) and she<br />\npresented herself all flushed with her clothes out of<br />\norder. \"Oh, Elroy!\" she cried, half-laughing,<br />\nhalf-scolding, and a young bearded man whom<br />\nElroy knew he could break like a twig came to the<br />\ndoor and said \"Who's your friend?\" Elroy excused<br />\nhimself quickly and hid for shame in the dark part<br />\nof the hall for a few moments. When he awoke the<br />\nnext morning their laughter still echoed in his ears.<br />\nBut she couldn't have known because she could<br />\nnever hurt anyone intentionally, he was sure of<br />\nthat at least.<br />\nSometimes he thought<br />\nshe didn't care: she would open the door, \"Too<br />\nbusy\" she would say brusquely, and vanish in an<br />\ninstant. Yet, other times she was warm and<br />\nsoft and cuddly. They would exchange little<br />\nkisses and sometimes big kisses and there was that<br />\none time when he felt her upper breast and kissed<br />\nit. It was soft, like the wallet his mother had once<br />\ngiven him for his birthday; he would like to have<br />\nbeen able to express it better but that's what it felt<br />\nlike to him.One Saturday in early March, he came<br />\nby Bellemore Gardens and asked Sheila if she<br />\nwouls take a walk with him. She was annoyed- he<br />\nshould have called- but Elroy persisted and whined<br />\nso that she gave in. It was a beautiful day- the first<br />\nwarm sun of the year- and he wanted to share it<br />\nwith her. He knew alot about nature (he picked it<br />\nup while he worked at the egg hatchery,away from<br />\nthe city, down green country roads), and he<br />\nwanted to tell her all about it. lie told her the<br />\nnames of the trees, how to tell one kind of grass<br />\nfrom another, where the flowers would come up<br />\nlater in the spring. \"I know what a maple tree is!\"<br />\nshe cried, and he asked her what the difference was<br />\nbetween a Norwegian and a Japanese maple and<br />\nshe pouted and he laughed. It was wonderful. Even<br />\nwhen she made a face and cried \"You're so boring,<br />\nElroy!\" it was wonderful. Soon she became tired<br />\nand cold and her feet were damp, so they cut their<br />\nwalk short and retired to her apartment. Before<br />\nthey went in, Elroy turned his face upward and<br />\nsmiled happily. \"I love the sun,\" he said, and she<br />\ntold him how she hated it and lived for the moon<br />\nand went out at odd hours with almost nothing on<br />\nto take moonbaths. He was shocked and told her<br />\nso, which made her both angry and amused, and<br />\nshe made him apologize twice before they went<br />\nback in.<br />\n***<br /><br />\nShe ate an orange and<br />\nwatched him through the peephole of her door as<br />\nhe stood there waiting for a response to his anxious<br />\nknocking. \"Come!\" she cried to Miriam, waving<br />\nher over to her side. \"No, Sheila, it's cruel. I<br />\nwon't.\" \"Come here! I'll die laughing,\" Sheila<br />\nshouted, and they stood together, poking each<br />\nother in the ribs and cackling fiercely. Elroy heard<br />\nthem, but he kept on until there was no longer any<br />\nhope of her answering him. Then he turned away<br />\nand ran outside to breathe.<br />\nIt had gone on too long<br />\nand became boring. For a brief time, she had found<br />\nit amusing- she liked to study the amatory habits<br />\nof those from a different world. It had been her<br />\ngreatest treat when she was home over the summer<br />\nand her parents were building a new wing onto the<br />\nhouse. All sorts of workmen were there- carpenters<br />\nand electricians and painters- and she would peel<br />\ndown to a raspberry colored bikini and bask in the<br />\nsun on the front lawn. They stared, and when she<br />\nknew she had them all, she would flex the muscles<br />\nin her calves and stretch her arms back, making the<br />\nlittle brown tummy hard and smooth. But soon it<br />\nbored her and she retreated to a dark room for the<br />\nrest of the summer, peeping out at the burly<br />\nworkmen who had already forgotten her. She<br />\nthought that Elroy would forget quickly, too, and<br />\nthat no one would be hurt.

Opening the front door, she listened<br />\nquietly, making sure that everyone in the house<br />\nwas asleep before entering. Closing the door behind<br />\nher, she stepped out of her shoes, turned off the<br />\nlight in the hallway, and went upstairs to her room.<br />\nShe lay on her bed<br />\nwithout undressing. A fixture in the middle of the<br />\nceiling cast shadows into the corners and crevices<br />\nof the room. But Stephie, staring past the fixture<br />\nand the ceiling, saw only white light. She did not<br />\ncry. Rather water filled her eyes and drained past<br />\nher temples to become lost in her brown hair upon<br />\nthe pillow. The room was silence. She could hear<br />\nthe air move past her head. It seemed to be falling<br />\nover her.<br />\nIn the eye of the light she<br />\nsaw herself lying slightly chilled in Jeff's arms,<br />\nnaked, staring into his face with its features<br />\nshadowed and indistinguishable above her. Against<br />\nthis image she tried to order her thoughts, to calm<br />\nherself, and to make some sense out of the steamy<br />\nvapor filling her head.<br />\nThere was a time before<br />\nthis time, after they had met, when to be with Jeff<br />\nhad been to be separated with herself and him in a<br />\nworld unknown to those they knew, to parents<br />\ntrying and friends undefined in their relationships.<br />\nBefore meeting in the summer past, a year away,<br />\ntroubled with the ills of growing up, the afflictions<br />\nof self-awareness, in the same room crying and<br />\nearlier at the dinner table; parents then had been<br />\nno help.

Young beauty, fifteen years old,<br />\nlong brown hair and deep eyes, tight shape and<br />\ncute face, solving nothing, answering nothing, but<br />\nmade the watery depressions at times seem normal,<br />\nas if, in being, a balance, a tepid bath, something<br />\nhumanizing and addicting. There had been no aid<br />\nfound in her bright wit or in the philosophies of<br />\nDad and older brother Otis. Points had been<br />\narrived at where thinking stopped. Something had<br />\nbeen comprehended but not understood,<br />\nsomething that would, that had, ripped insides and<br />\nstomach apart, a searing pain.<br />\nThe attempted insights,<br />\nefforts to include Jeff in some conclusion, all had<br />\ndrowned in a lack of knowing, inadequate<br />\nperceptions. He had had no place in them. Why try<br />\nto place him where he did not belong, to shroud<br />\nthe two of them in questions and fears, a blanket<br />\nof impotence? Other people were so many theatres<br />\nof encounter, movies from which to walk away<br />\nthrough doors swinging into light and day of<br />\ntogether with Jeff. Loneliness, at first defined by<br />\nhours away from him, had lost all form and<br />\nmeaning. Jeff was always behind and within<br />\neverything. Always and never- all of her time being<br />\nexisted only as he was, and he and she were<br />\nconstantly, even during the days between their<br />\ncoming together.<br />\nNow lying in bed,<br />\nconception of self past and future was but the<br />\npresent moment.

She rolled onto her back. The<br />\nlight caught her eyes and burned. Flying about her<br />\nhead, thoughts collided against each other and<br />\npainfully aginst the sides of her brain, until all she<br />\nknew was the pain, and then hatred, and then<br />\nnothing. And then she decided that she had had<br />\nenough.<br />\nShe got out of bed and<br />\ngroped her way across the room without pausing to<br />\ntry to gain some sense of balance, but rather<br />\npushing herself along over the floor and out into<br />\nthe hallway. She stopped moving in front of the<br />\nmirror in the bathroom and caught her image for<br />\nan instant- brown snarled hair, long crumpled,<br />\nred-blotched face, pulled puffed eyes, sick dying<br />\nlooking. She turned on the faucet. The ,water<br />\ncrashed into the sink basin. Pulling the mirror<br />\ntowards her, her image slid away, and she grasped a<br />\nbottle from the cabinet now opened in front of<br />\nher. The pain in her head and the ache in her<br />\nstomach began to organize themselves into a low<br />\nrhythm.Then they broke again. Stephie read the<br />\nlabel on the bottle but did not understand it. She<br />\nswallowed the bottle's twelve pills, blindly shoving<br />\nthem into her mouth two and three at a time, and<br />\nthen, with water cupped in her hands from the<br />\nstream falling from the faucet, pushing them down<br />\nher throat in long pressured gulps.<br />\nThe bottle emptied, the<br />\ncabinet closed, and the water turned off<br />\nsimultaneously. Stephie in a moment stood mind<br />\nblanked and stomach shocked staring into the<br />\nmirror, her eyes glazed and unseeing. Turning off<br />\nthe bathroom light, suddenly realizing herself to<br />\nbe drowning in exhaustion, she found her way<br />\nback to her bedroom. She pushed down the<br />\nswitch next to her door and undressed in the<br />\nlight from the hallway. Closing the door behind<br />\nher, she made her way in the darkness to her<br />\nbed.<br />\nKnees sliding toward her<br /><br />\nchest, mind starting to clear, trying with a final<br />\ndetermined, almost cold, attitude to discover if<br />\nwith Jeff it was love. Only love could justify what<br />\nthey- had become to each other. What was it? Love,<br />\nand yet it hurt so much, hurt with him all the time<br />\nnow, every time with him, almost every time, all<br />\nthe time, thinking of him, it hurt. But it must be<br />\nlove. What else but love? If it was, there was no<br />\nwant for it anymore, whatever need or loneliness.<br />\nOnly an ending. To be done.<br />\nThe pain in her head was<br />\nfuller now. It pressed everywhere against the sides<br />\nof her brain. In the center of her skull was heavy<br />\nmoist sand. The pill taste that lingered in her<br />\nmouth began dropping seeds of nausea into her<br />\nstomach. Stephie rolled onto her back and then<br />\nonto her side again. She was hot. Still, she held her<br />\nblankets to her and grabbed air into her mouth in<br />\ngulps.<br />\nThe first night together,<br />\nknowing, being ...too full for any one time or state.<br />\nBut it had been good, knowing what was<br />\nhappiness.

Then she lay down<br />\nstopped, sometimes his mother driving him saying<br />\nand it came up. It was in her hair and on her<br />\nshe liked her, Jeff saying so. Dad talks to him and<br />\nsheets and on everything. After it stopped, she<br />\nlikes him. - Ma likes him, sometimes in winter<br />\nrolled over to the far side of her bed and pressed<br />\ndriving him home after coming in from an evening<br />\nher face against the wall. In the darkness, ache<br />\nout and finding him to be still there, tired,<br />\ncrumple-clothed at one in the morning, in darkness \u2014and emptiness.

They trusted him<br />\ncompletely and it was right they should trust him<br />\ncompletely, Jeff, good, kind, always right... ethical,<br />\nabove all, good. He had never forced. No more<br />\nthan kissing before Jeff never forcing, kissing<br />\nmaybe a few, how many, who, no difference- never<br />\nany need to do more. Before. With Jeff, kissing had<br />\nbeen a long time.

With his hands at<br />\nAmerican.<br />\nan<br />\nfirst there had been nothing wrong.

A small enclave of my<br />\nassociates excitedly asked me if I had<br />\never heard Commander Cody and his<br />\nlipst Planet Airman. I allowed as how I<br />\nhadn't, but, judging from their<br />\nenthusiasm, I sure would like to. As that<br /><br />\npoint, I really didn't know what to<br />\nexpect. This particular group of friends<br />\nwas very into mescaline and avant-gard<br />\njazz, and with a name like Commander<br />\nCody and his Lost Planet Airman and an<br />\nalbum title like Ozone, I anticipated the<br />\nwierdest. They didn't let me hear it that<br />\nnight, they waited until the next, after<br /><br />\nwe'd all knocked off a couple of Pabst<br />\nTall-Boys, and then they took out the<br />\nstrange looking cover and said \"Now,<br />\nlisten to this.\" Soon to emerge from the<br />\nspeakers was side 2, cut 1, \"Lost in the<br />\nOzone,\" surely one of scveetest,<br />\nsmoothest country-rock songs ever<br />\nrecorded. One glass of wine/Two drinks<br /><br />\nMarlon Brando's towering performance in The Godfather<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThe Godfather is going to be the<br />\nbiggest money-maker of all time, and it<br />\ndeserves to be. The movie has great<br />\npower and style. It also has a series of<br />\nperformances that makes most of the<br />\n\"good\" movies around look like re-runs<br />\nof Petticoat Junction.<br />\nLike the Corleone family it portrays,<br />\nthe movie doesn't mess around. Variety<br />\nreported that the film made $7.5 million<br />\nin its first two weeks. Gone With the<br />\nWind, for example, has grossed a mere<br />\n$73 million since its original release in<br />\n1939. A better idea of the moolah<br />\ninvolved may be gleaned from this figure:<br />\nWoodstock has made only $13.5 million<br />\nsince its 1970 release. Within a few years,<br />\nindustry sources predict, Paramount<br />\nStudios, which made The Godfather, will<br />\nbe able to purchase the entire<br />\nmembership of the Mafia, thus ending<br />\norganized crime in America.<br />\nIn Baltimore, the film is playing most<br />\nconveniently at the Senator theatre,<br />\nwhere, as an indication of its eternal<br />\nengagement, the sidewalks surrounding<br />\nthe ever-crowded movie palace are etched<br />\nwith advertisements. The impact the film<br />\nhas had is also revealed in the surly<br />\nmanner of the ushers, who, in truth, have<br />\ntaken to wearing white silk ties on black<br />\nshirts.<br />\nThe film charts the power struggles of<br />\na major New York Mafia family in the<br />\nlate 1940's and early 1950's, along with<br /><br />\nanguishedl<br /><br />\nin emotional restraint in<br /><br />\nnear-fatal shooting, the death of a son<br />\nand the cruel process of aging. Brando<br />\nhas always been hailed for his ability to<br />\ninhabit a character, but here the<br />\ntranstormation is nothing short of<br />\nstunning. In fact, by this single role,<br />\nBrando single-handedly revises the<br />\nstandards we will expect of those who<br />\nplay hoodlums or the aged.<br />\nWe have forgotten just how good he<br />\ncan be. He had allowed his large talent to<br />\nbe contained in worthless films over the<br />\nlast 15 years, and for those born in the<br />\n1950's, his years of brilliance, Marlon<br />\nBrando was simply a washed-up figure<br />\nfrom the past. Now he is back, and we<br />\ncan understand why he is considered one<br />\nof the greatest actors in film history. He<br />\nis, quite simply, a delight to watch, and<br />\nthe other stars who have replaced him<br />\nhave not even come close to matching his<br />\nextraordinary talent.<br />\nBut Brando's performance is not caged<br />\nby shoddy supporting actors or poor<br />\nmaterial. Don Corleone's sons and<br />\nadversaries are superbly cast, and director<br />\nFrancis Ford Coppola has provided a<br />\nframework of tight editing, good pacing<br />\nand sharp dialogue to make this a totally<br />\nengrossing three-hour movie.<br />\nEspecially outstanding is Al Pacino's<br />\nrole as Michael Corleone, the Ivy League<br />\nwar-hero son who attempts to preserve<br />\nthe distance between himself and the<br />\nfamily business but ends up as his father's<br />\nsuccessor. The shooting of Don Corleone<br /><br />\ninexorably draws Michael into murder<br />\nand revenge, and Michael kills his soul in<br />\nthe process. It is an incredible change<br />\nthat comes over him, no less powerful<br />\nbecause of its gradual subtlety. The<br />\ninnocent, soft eyes go hard, the boyish<br />\nineptness shifts to a tough assurance, and.<br />\nMichael even picks up a few gestures<br />\nfrom his father. He learns in the end the<br />\ndark secrets of power, but at a price that<br />\nmay have been too great.<br />\nThe movie, as you may have read,<br />\nexcellently adapts the 400-plus pages of<br />\nthe novel, keeping in the essentials of the<br />\nplot and the characters. The movie isn't<br />\nreally better than the book, but it is more<br /><br />\noutstanding compared to other films than<br />\nthe novel is compared to other literature.<br />\nPublicity Heist?<br />\nThe impact of the movie is undeniable.<br />\nIn New York City, for example, a movie<br />\ntheatre showing the film was robbed of<br />\n$13,000 and the manager was shot in the<br />\narm. Reports indicated that those in line<br />\nthought that the heist was an elaborate<br />\npublicity stunt, and applauded the two<br />\nescaping robbers. Personally, I found<br />\nmyself slapping my girlfriend and<br />\nexhibiting a new toughness with<br />\ncandy-store owners. The film, in any<br />\ncase, is outstanding, and well worth the<br />\ntwo-week vigil on line.<br /><br />\nof gin/And it's back to the ozone again.<br />\nWe joined the Commander there that<br />\nnight with some cheap wine and a few<br />\nmore Tall-Boys which took us through<br />\nHot Rod Lincoln, Twenty-Flight Rock,<br />\nSeeds and Stems (Again), Annie, Wine Do<br />\nYer Stuff, Family Bible and other<br />\nfavorites.

The Commander<br />\nhimself appeared quite drunk and seemed<br />\nto have difficulty locating the first few<br />\nnotes of \"Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the<br />\nBar\" (though Leo the grad student might<br />\nhave worn out those particular high notes<br />\nwhile accompanying the pick-up band<br />\nthat preceded the Airmen). The<br />\nCommander was also having trouble with<br />\nthe microphone and a few other things,<br />\nlike walking. But he still played a pretty<br />\nmean piano.
