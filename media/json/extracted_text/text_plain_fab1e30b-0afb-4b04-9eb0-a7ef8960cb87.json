In the foremost row<br />\nwere the statesmen and athletes<br />\nwhose importance was already becoming a matter of general knowledge and comment. Everybody had<br />\nshoulders thrown back\u2014so serious,<br />\nso important. Peace reigned supreme. Suddenly the windows of<br />\nheaven (i. e., the German seminary)<br />\nopened and two buckets of water<br />\ndescended or dashed (according to<br />\nthe American's report of the matter) on the group of freshmen.<br />\nThey were dazed awhile and a<br />\nfew shivered and meekly they took<br />\nup another position on the steps ot<br />\nthe physics laboratory. The sophs,<br />\nhaving succeeded in routing them<br />\nfrom one intrenchment, decided to<br />\npursue. They got into the Physics<br />\nBuilding, but could find no water or<br />\nfire hose. They went to the windows directly over the steps, however, and gazing out saw that the<br />\nphotographer's head had already retired beneath his cloth. Two of the<br />\nnumber whose voices were as the<br />\nbelch of a \"Busy Bertha\" leaned<br />\nfar out and exploded. The effect<br />\nwas at once gratifying. It is said<br />\nthat there were no serious casualties<br />\nin the mad scramble as the freshies<br />\nscampered from their positions.<br />\nA fight followed, the freshmen<br />\naccusing every sophomore they encountered. There were several '17<br />\nmen standing about, and all pitched<br />\nin for a round or so. A bluecoated referee called the affair a<br />\ndraw, and the battle was given up.<br />\nThe classes then assembled for yells,<br />\nthe cop coming in for a number of<br />\ndaisies and las.<br />\nThe sad detail has to be added<br />\nthat the photograph of the freshman class was not taken, and unless<br />\nan arrangement for another \"sitting\" can be made, the Hullabaloo<br />\nwill be without a picture. An<br />\nanonymous letter received by the<br />\neditor of the year book suggests<br />\nthat instead of the picture, a drawing of the incident be used. This,<br />\nof course, will not be done if a<br />\npicture can be procured.<br />\nIron Crosses will be awarded the<br />\nthree enterprising sophomores who<br />\nconducted the rout.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., DECEMBER 7, 1914.<br />\n<br />\nHOW HOPKINS CAN HELP BELGIANS AND RED CROSS<br />\nThe University Young Men's Christian Association and The NewsLetter Have Arranged to Receive Contributions of Money<br />\nand Clothing for the Belgians and to Roll<br />\nBandages for the Red Cross.<br />\nActing upon the belief that some<br />\nsuch movement for the relief of the<br />\nsuffering Belgian people and the<br />\nsupplying of the Red Cross organization with bandages, as has been<br />\ninstituted in many of the leading<br />\neastern universi ies, should be<br />\nbrought to the attention of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins students, the University Young Men's Christian Association and THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhave inaugurated a campaign for<br />\nthe relief of suffering incident to<br />\nthe war in Europe. For the success<br />\nof this movement they depend entirely upon the interest and enthusiasm manifested by the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nThe Young Men's Christian Association and THE NEWS-LETTER are<br />\nnot rushing unaided into the field<br />\nof untried theory. Its plan of campaign, heartily endorsed by Miss<br />\nMary B. Shearer, who is taking<br />\nsuch a prominent part in the local<br />\nmovement for materially assisting<br />\nthe destitute Belgians, is merely<br />\nthat of urging the students at Johns<br />\nHopkins to do what is already being accomplished in many smaller<br />\nand less influential institutions. Not<br />\nonly will the city organization of<br />\nthe Belgian Relief Society lend its<br />\nsupport and co-operation, but several members of the faculty are also<br />\ninterested in the work and, by exercising their moral support, will aid<br />\nin bringing it to a successful issue.<br />\nThe plan of campaign which has<br />\nbeen drawn up, and which will be<br />\ngiven in full detail in this article, is<br />\narranged to meet the needs of the<br />\nBelgian Relief Society of this city.<br />\nThe work at Johns Hopkins will<br />\nbe in charge of a committee which<br />\nhas already been appointed and<br />\nwhich will be entrusted with the<br />\ncarrying out the details. All the<br />\nclasses at the University are represented in this body, in order that<br />\nthe interest in the new movement<br />\nwhich is being inaugurated may be<br />\ngeneral, rather than confined to any<br />\nclass, group or faction. Walter D.<br />\nSutton, secretary of the Young<br />\nMen's Christian Association, is<br />\nchairmen of the committee and C.<br />\nSewell Weech, J. S. Short, Thomas<br />\nJ. Tingley, George D. Penniman,<br />\nJr., J. Trueman Thompson and<br />\nAlexander Randall are the other<br />\n, members. These men will take<br />\ncharge of the campaign and do their<br />\nutmost to secure the support of the<br />\nstudent body as a whole to assist<br />\nthem in the enterprise.<br />\nThe branch of the general movement which requires the co-opera-<br />\n<br />\ntion of Hopkins students may be<br />\ndivided into three distinct parts,<br />\nwhich will be dealt with separately.<br />\nThe first aim of the campaign will<br />\nbe to collect as many second-hand<br />\nsuits or articles of clothing of any<br />\nkind as is possible, that they may<br />\nbe sent to the Belgian refugees in<br />\nEngland. The support of these<br />\nwretched and destitute people is, of<br />\ncourse, a work that many wholehearted Americans consider their<br />\nwork. The chief reason for sending the supplies to the refugees in<br />\nEngland, rather than to their 'even<br />\nmore unfortunate fellow-countrymen across the Channel, however,<br />\nis that the Dutch government has<br />\nrefused to allow any but new articles of wearing apparel to pass<br />\nthrough Rotterdam. The Maryland<br />\nship Lynota, therefore, which will<br />\nleave for Europe on December 23,<br />\nwill carry only unused garments to<br />\nthe Belgians on the mainland, while<br />\nall second-hand clothing will be<br />\nsent to England at a later time.<br />\nThe second aim of the campaign<br />\nwill be to enlist the services of a<br />\nlarge \u2022 number of students for the<br />\nwork of bandage-rolling. The secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association has offered the use<br />\nof Lever:ng Hall for this work,<br />\nwhich will be entered upon as soon<br />\nas possible. Material for the bandages will be supplied by the Belgian Relief Society of Baltimore.<br />\nIt is hoped that a large number of<br />\nundergraduates will volunteer for<br />\nthis branch of service, as the Red<br />\nCross organization in Europe is being seriously handicapped in its<br />\noperations by lack of proper materials and general equipment. Not<br />\nonly the larger and better-known<br />\nuniversities have already entered<br />\nupon this work, but several smaller<br />\ninstitutions in Maryland have taken<br />\nit up and Johns Hopkins surely<br />\nshould not be content to remain ingloriously in the rear. The increasing spirit of progressiveness and<br />\nradical desire for growth and expansion, which have manifested<br />\nthemselves at the University during the last few years, should ensure a ready and enthusiastic response to this call for assistance<br />\nin a work that aims to alleviate the<br />\nsufferings of the maimed and<br />\nwounded in all the armies at present<br />\nfighting in Europe.<br />\nThe third work will be to receive contributions which are intended for use in feeding the Belgians who are without homes in their<br />\n(Continued on page 1, col. 4)<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nFRESHMEN SWAMP SOPHOMORES<br />\nCaptain Hoffman's Men Prove Superior<br />\nin Annual Game.<br />\n<br />\nThe prestige of the sophomore<br />\nclass received a body blow at Homewood on Saturday, when the freshmen scored a decisive victory, 26-0,<br />\nin the annual interclass football<br />\ngame. At no period of the contest<br />\nwas the issue in doubt, for the<br />\nfreshies scored in three of the four<br />\nquarters and completely outplayed<br />\ntheir opponents.<br />\nA remarkable feature of the<br />\ngame was the apparent ease with<br />\nwhich each team advanced the ball<br />\nthrough the other's line. Neither<br />\nthe sophomore nor the freshman<br />\nforwards seemed able to hold and<br />\nthe result was a gain every time<br />\nthe backs hit the line. The sophs<br />\nmarched the whole length of the<br />\nfield sev er al times; Mowbray,<br />\nBrooks and Captain Gorman tearing<br />\nlarge holes in the opposition. But,<br />\nwhen within striking distance, the<br />\nsecond-year men invariably fumbled<br />\nor attempted a forward pass and<br />\nthus lost all their chances to push<br />\nthe ball across.<br />\nBobby Hoffman, 'Varsity fullback and all-Maryland selection,<br />\nwas the offensive and defensive<br />\nmainstay of the freshmen. He was<br />\ngood for a gain whenever called<br />\nupon and it was his consistent<br />\nplunging and end running that won<br />\nthe game for '18. On the first lineup, after the kick-off, he broke<br />\nthrough for forty yards, placing the<br />\nball in a position from which it was<br />\ncarried over for the first score in<br />\nthree plays.<br />\nThe scrap over the freshman banner was more interesting than the<br />\ngame, however, and it resulted in<br />\ncomplete victory for '17. Today<br />\nmany sophs are exhibiting bits of<br />\nblue silk and claiming that they<br />\ncame from the ill-fated standard of<br />\nthe other class. Whether the sophs<br />\ngot the whole of the blue banner or<br />\nnot is a question, but it is safe to<br />\nsay that'what is left would not be<br />\nan adornment to a flag pole. Therefore, '18 has ordered a new and<br />\nhandsomer flag, to be unfurled after<br />\nthe interclass meet in January.

This plan<br />\nof dividing up the squad will be of<br />\ngreat benefit to both the coaches and<br />\ncandidates.<br />\n<br />\nOver fifty men gathered in the<br />\nTrophy Room last Friday afternoon<br />\nto organize themselves into the<br />\ntrack squad for the coming indoor<br />\nand outdoor seasons. The situation is a most unusual one in that so<br />\nfew of last year's point winners are<br />\nback in their old places. Only two<br />\nmembers of the relay team, which<br />\ndefeated Virginia indoors and won<br />\ntheir event at the Penn Relays, are<br />\nback at the University. One of<br />\nthem was hurt during the football<br />\nseason, and the other, a graduate, is<br />\nso busy that it is doubtful whether<br />\nhe will run. The squad as a whole<br />\nhas suffered most severe losses, so<br />\nthat the situation has only one parallel in the history of track at Hopkins\u2014that of 1900-01.<br />\nIn this year, however, a practically \"green\" team started on a path<br />\nof continuous victory which lasted<br />\nthree years, and a relay team of<br />\nthree freshmen and one upper classman was formed which scored fourteen victories and suffered but one<br />\ndefeat in two years. A record was<br />\nsmashed by this fast four which had<br />\nbeen considered almost \"unsmashable,\" and the whole team broke<br />\neight records in the course of its<br />\nbright career.<br />\nThese astonishing results, as was<br />\npointed out last Friday by Mr. England, the track coach, were due in<br />\na very great degree to the spirit and<br />\ndetermination of the squad, which<br />\nfaced the discouraging outlook with<br />\nreal Hopkins spirit. Mr. England,<br />\nin speaking of this great opportunity now for new men, called attention to the fact that in a dual<br />\nmeet there must be two or three<br />\nmen entered in each of thirteen<br />\nevents, making at least twenty-six<br />\nfirst-string men, and also three relay teams are to be entered at the<br />\nArmory meet. This shows bow<br />\nmany places there are to work for.<br />\nMr. England also thrilled the<br />\nhearts of the men by a vivid description of the two-mile race in<br />\nwhich Freddie Lee so covered himself with glory and brought cheers<br />\nfor Hopkins from eighteen thousand throats at the Northern Intercollegiates last spring when he led<br />\nthe field for over half the race and<br />\nfinally finished in the first five in<br />\nthis record-breaking event. With<br />\nsuch a picture as this before them,<br />\nthe men who are facing the difficult<br />\nproblem this year can have no lack<br />\nof inspiration.<br />\nManager Deems reported that the<br />\nschedule will likely be very similar<br />\nto that of last year, although but<br />\nfew dates are definitely set as yet.<br />\nIt is planned to include the following:<br />\nIndoors\u2014Armory Meet, George<br />\nWashington, Georgetown.<br />\nOutdoors\u2014Navy, Penn Relays,<br />\nSouth Atlantic Intercollegiates,<br />\nWashington and Lee, Lehigh.<br />\n(('ontinued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n5 FOR YOUR DEN 5<br />\n<br />\nCollege and Fraternity Stationery<br />\nBanquet and Dance Cards\u2014Invitations<br />\n<br />\nBeautiful College Pennants<br />\n<br />\nJAS.

The Belgians<br />\nneed clothes and provisions. It is<br />\nquite probable that Hopkins will be<br />\nunable to contribute any great<br />\namount of provisions, but it can<br />\ngive money and clothing. Harvard<br />\nand Princeton students packed barrels and boxes of second-hand suits,<br />\nshirts, underwear and other articles<br />\nwhich could be used by the Belgians<br />\nwho have lost their homes. More<br />\nof these articles are needed, and<br />\nHopkins students can contribute.<br />\nA committee of which Secretary<br />\nWagner of the Y. M. C. A. is the<br />\nchairman, acting for Miss Mary B.<br />\nShearer, chairman of the State<br />\nCenters Committee of the Belgian<br />\nRelief Fund, will receive all contributions from Hopkins students.<br />\nThe University depot will be in<br />\nLevering Hall. All are urged to<br />\nbring in as much and as many of<br />\nthe articles named above as they<br />\ncan. They will be packed and<br />\nturned over to Miss Shearer for<br />\ndelivery to Belgium.<br />\nAnother work that- is to be done<br />\nat Hopkins is the rolling of bandages for the Red Cross. This will<br />\nbe begun in Levering Hall at a time<br />\nto be announced later, and it is<br />\nhoped that a great number of our<br />\nstudents will interest themselves in<br />\nthis form of service. It has been<br />\ndone at a great many of the other<br />\nAmerican colleges, and Hopkins<br />\nshould do its share.<br />\nThe third work the Hopkins committee will undertake is the receiving of contributions for the purchase of provisions. A ship has<br />\nbeen secured by the Belgian Relief<br />\nFund Committee; it remains for<br />\nMaryland to fill it. The \"Lynota\"<br />\nwill come to the wharf of the Canton Company on December 16 and<br />\nsail--a Maryland Relief Ship\u2014as<br />\nsoon as it is loaded. What satisfaction Maryland will feel if that<br />\nship goes out with every corner<br />\nfilled. The ship is supplied free of<br />\ncost to Maryland so that every dollar contributed in the State will be<br />\nexpended here on food to send to<br />\nBelgium. Much has been received,<br />\nmore is needed. Do you realize<br />\nwhat it means to fill a ship? The<br />\ntask is a big one, but not too big<br />\nfor Maryland. When the ship sails<br />\nHopkins will want to feel that some<br />\nof the food going out on it to starving people without a country has<br />\nbeen put there by it.<br />\nIf you give only ten cents it will<br />\nbuy a can of condensed milk to<br />\nkeep a child alive.

Suddenly the windows of<br />\nheaven (i. e., the German seminary)<br />\nopened and two buckets of water<br />\ndescended or dashed (according to<br />\nthe American's report of the matter) on the group of freshmen.<br />\nThey were dazed awhile and a<br />\nfew shivered and meekly they took<br />\nup another position on the steps ot<br />\nthe physics laboratory. The sophs,<br />\nhaving succeeded in routing them<br />\nfrom one intrenchment, decided to<br />\npursue. They got into the Physics<br />\nBuilding, but could find no water or<br />\nfire hose. They went to the windows directly over the steps, however, and gazing out saw that the<br />\nphotographer's head had already retired beneath his cloth. Two of the<br />\nnumber whose voices were as the<br />\nbelch of a \"Busy Bertha\" leaned<br />\nfar out and exploded. The effect<br />\nwas at once gratifying. It is said<br />\nthat there were no serious casualties<br />\nin the mad scramble as the freshies<br />\nscampered from their positions.<br />\nA fight followed, the freshmen<br />\naccusing every sophomore they encountered. There were several '17<br />\nmen standing about, and all pitched<br />\nin for a round or so. A bluecoated referee called the affair a<br />\ndraw, and the battle was given up.<br />\nThe classes then assembled for yells,<br />\nthe cop coming in for a number of<br />\ndaisies and las.<br />\nThe sad detail has to be added<br />\nthat the photograph of the freshman class was not taken, and unless<br />\nan arrangement for another \"sitting\" can be made, the Hullabaloo<br />\nwill be without a picture. An<br />\nanonymous letter received by the<br />\neditor of the year book suggests<br />\nthat instead of the picture, a drawing of the incident be used. This,<br />\nof course, will not be done if a<br />\npicture can be procured.<br />\nIron Crosses will be awarded the<br />\nthree enterprising sophomores who<br />\nconducted the rout.<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., DECEMBER 7, 1914.<br /><br />\nHOW HOPKINS CAN HELP BELGIANS AND RED CROSS<br />\nThe University Young Men's Christian Association and The NewsLetter Have Arranged to Receive Contributions of Money<br />\nand Clothing for the Belgians and to Roll<br />\nBandages for the Red Cross.<br />\nActing upon the belief that some<br />\nsuch movement for the relief of the<br />\nsuffering Belgian people and the<br />\nsupplying of the Red Cross organization with bandages, as has been<br />\ninstituted in many of the leading<br />\neastern universi ies, should be<br />\nbrought to the attention of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins students, the University Young Men's Christian Association and THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhave inaugurated a campaign for<br />\nthe relief of suffering incident to<br />\nthe war in Europe. For the success<br />\nof this movement they depend entirely upon the interest and enthusiasm manifested by the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nThe Young Men's Christian Association and THE NEWS-LETTER are<br />\nnot rushing unaided into the field<br />\nof untried theory. Its plan of campaign, heartily endorsed by Miss<br />\nMary B. Shearer, who is taking<br />\nsuch a prominent part in the local<br />\nmovement for materially assisting<br />\nthe destitute Belgians, is merely<br />\nthat of urging the students at Johns<br />\nHopkins to do what is already being accomplished in many smaller<br />\nand less influential institutions. Not<br />\nonly will the city organization of<br />\nthe Belgian Relief Society lend its<br />\nsupport and co-operation, but several members of the faculty are also<br />\ninterested in the work and, by exercising their moral support, will aid<br />\nin bringing it to a successful issue.<br />\nThe plan of campaign which has<br />\nbeen drawn up, and which will be<br />\ngiven in full detail in this article, is<br />\narranged to meet the needs of the<br />\nBelgian Relief Society of this city.<br />\nThe work at Johns Hopkins will<br />\nbe in charge of a committee which<br />\nhas already been appointed and<br />\nwhich will be entrusted with the<br />\ncarrying out the details. All the<br />\nclasses at the University are represented in this body, in order that<br />\nthe interest in the new movement<br />\nwhich is being inaugurated may be<br />\ngeneral, rather than confined to any<br />\nclass, group or faction. Walter D.<br />\nSutton, secretary of the Young<br />\nMen's Christian Association, is<br />\nchairmen of the committee and C.<br />\nSewell Weech, J. S. Short, Thomas<br />\nJ. Tingley, George D. Penniman,<br />\nJr., J. Trueman Thompson and<br />\nAlexander Randall are the other<br />\n, members. These men will take<br />\ncharge of the campaign and do their<br />\nutmost to secure the support of the<br />\nstudent body as a whole to assist<br />\nthem in the enterprise.<br />\nThe branch of the general movement which requires the co-opera-<br /><br />\ntion of Hopkins students may be<br />\ndivided into three distinct parts,<br />\nwhich will be dealt with separately.<br />\nThe first aim of the campaign will<br />\nbe to collect as many second-hand<br />\nsuits or articles of clothing of any<br />\nkind as is possible, that they may<br />\nbe sent to the Belgian refugees in<br />\nEngland. The support of these<br />\nwretched and destitute people is, of<br />\ncourse, a work that many wholehearted Americans consider their<br />\nwork. The chief reason for sending the supplies to the refugees in<br />\nEngland, rather than to their 'even<br />\nmore unfortunate fellow-countrymen across the Channel, however,<br />\nis that the Dutch government has<br />\nrefused to allow any but new articles of wearing apparel to pass<br />\nthrough Rotterdam. The Maryland<br />\nship Lynota, therefore, which will<br />\nleave for Europe on December 23,<br />\nwill carry only unused garments to<br />\nthe Belgians on the mainland, while<br />\nall second-hand clothing will be<br />\nsent to England at a later time.<br />\nThe second aim of the campaign<br />\nwill be to enlist the services of a<br />\nlarge \u2022 number of students for the<br />\nwork of bandage-rolling. The secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association has offered the use<br />\nof Lever:ng Hall for this work,<br />\nwhich will be entered upon as soon<br />\nas possible. Material for the bandages will be supplied by the Belgian Relief Society of Baltimore.<br />\nIt is hoped that a large number of<br />\nundergraduates will volunteer for<br />\nthis branch of service, as the Red<br />\nCross organization in Europe is being seriously handicapped in its<br />\noperations by lack of proper materials and general equipment. Not<br />\nonly the larger and better-known<br />\nuniversities have already entered<br />\nupon this work, but several smaller<br />\ninstitutions in Maryland have taken<br />\nit up and Johns Hopkins surely<br />\nshould not be content to remain ingloriously in the rear. The increasing spirit of progressiveness and<br />\nradical desire for growth and expansion, which have manifested<br />\nthemselves at the University during the last few years, should ensure a ready and enthusiastic response to this call for assistance<br />\nin a work that aims to alleviate the<br />\nsufferings of the maimed and<br />\nwounded in all the armies at present<br />\nfighting in Europe.<br />\nThe third work will be to receive contributions which are intended for use in feeding the Belgians who are without homes in their<br />\n(Continued on page 1, col. 4)<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nFRESHMEN SWAMP SOPHOMORES<br />\nCaptain Hoffman's Men Prove Superior<br />\nin Annual Game.<br /><br />\nThe prestige of the sophomore<br />\nclass received a body blow at Homewood on Saturday, when the freshmen scored a decisive victory, 26-0,<br />\nin the annual interclass football<br />\ngame. At no period of the contest<br />\nwas the issue in doubt, for the<br />\nfreshies scored in three of the four<br />\nquarters and completely outplayed<br />\ntheir opponents.<br />\nA remarkable feature of the<br />\ngame was the apparent ease with<br />\nwhich each team advanced the ball<br />\nthrough the other's line. Neither<br />\nthe sophomore nor the freshman<br />\nforwards seemed able to hold and<br />\nthe result was a gain every time<br />\nthe backs hit the line. The sophs<br />\nmarched the whole length of the<br />\nfield sev er al times; Mowbray,<br />\nBrooks and Captain Gorman tearing<br />\nlarge holes in the opposition. But,<br />\nwhen within striking distance, the<br />\nsecond-year men invariably fumbled<br />\nor attempted a forward pass and<br />\nthus lost all their chances to push<br />\nthe ball across.<br />\nBobby Hoffman, 'Varsity fullback and all-Maryland selection,<br />\nwas the offensive and defensive<br />\nmainstay of the freshmen. He was<br />\ngood for a gain whenever called<br />\nupon and it was his consistent<br />\nplunging and end running that won<br />\nthe game for '18. On the first lineup, after the kick-off, he broke<br />\nthrough for forty yards, placing the<br />\nball in a position from which it was<br />\ncarried over for the first score in<br />\nthree plays.<br />\nThe scrap over the freshman banner was more interesting than the<br />\ngame, however, and it resulted in<br />\ncomplete victory for '17. Today<br />\nmany sophs are exhibiting bits of<br />\nblue silk and claiming that they<br />\ncame from the ill-fated standard of<br />\nthe other class. Whether the sophs<br />\ngot the whole of the blue banner or<br />\nnot is a question, but it is safe to<br />\nsay that'what is left would not be<br />\nan adornment to a flag pole. Therefore, '18 has ordered a new and<br />\nhandsomer flag, to be unfurled after<br />\nthe interclass meet in January.

This meeting marks the beginning of indoor<br />\ntraining for the 1915 lacrosse squad.<br />\nVeterans and new-comers listened<br />\nwith attention to what Captain Tom<br />\nTroxell, the coaches and advisors<br />\nhad to say concerning plans for the<br />\ncoming season. Captain Troxell<br />\nopened the meeting with a short<br />\nspeech, and after discussing the<br />\nschedule, said that there were unusually bright prospects for taking the championship banner next<br />\nspring. He introduced \"Rainey\"<br />\nWolfe, who trained the Black and<br />\nBlue lacrosse players last year, and<br />\nwho is at the head of the coaching department again this season.<br />\nCoach Wolfe centered his talk<br />\nmainly on freshmen, whom he<br />\nspoke of as \"lucky,\" because they<br />\nhad the chance of landing some of<br />\nthe numerous places that are open<br />\nin the team this season. He pointed<br />\nout that there remain only two of<br />\nthe defense men of last year, none<br />\nof the mid-field, and but four of<br />\nthe attack men, and that all positions are undecided until the spring.<br />\nOther short talks were made by<br />\nEddie Hulbert, Julian Marshall,<br />\nMr. Clark, and Bill Schmeisser.<br />\nPitts Raleigh and Bob Lowndes,<br />\nwho were also on the program,<br />\nfound, at the last moment, that they<br />\nwould be unable to attend the meeting.<br />\nJulian Marshall and Eddie Hulbert were officially announced as<br />\nthe assistant coaches for 1915.<br />\nThese former Hopkins players told<br />\nthe men of the hard work that is<br />\nahead to win back the intercollegiate championship, and emphasized the fact that it is the work<br />\nat the beginning of the year in the<br />\ncage that counts.<br />\nNext, Bill Schmeisser, advisor to<br />\nthe team, who has had 16 years' experience in lacrosse, and who is regarded as one of the leading authorities, on the game in America,<br />\ntold of the merits of lacrosse. He<br />\nalso pointed out that lacrosse is the<br />\ngame that Hopkins is known by.<br />\nThat no man who becomes interested in lacrosse will ever leave<br />\nthe game is his firm conviction.<br />\nCaptain Troxell has decided to<br />\ncontinue the excellent plan adopted<br />\nlast year for the preliminary work<br />\nin the cage. It is his intention to<br />\nmake a division in the squad\u2014one<br />\nset practicing on Monday and<br />\nThursday, and the other on Tuesday and Friday. Practice will begin at 4.45 o'clock. On Wednesday the entire squad will report in<br />\nthe cage at four o'clock, and on<br />\nSaturday at 3.30 o'clock. This plan<br />\nof dividing up the squad will be of<br />\ngreat benefit to both the coaches and<br />\ncandidates.<br /><br />\nOver fifty men gathered in the<br />\nTrophy Room last Friday afternoon<br />\nto organize themselves into the<br />\ntrack squad for the coming indoor<br />\nand outdoor seasons. The situation is a most unusual one in that so<br />\nfew of last year's point winners are<br />\nback in their old places. Only two<br />\nmembers of the relay team, which<br />\ndefeated Virginia indoors and won<br />\ntheir event at the Penn Relays, are<br />\nback at the University. One of<br />\nthem was hurt during the football<br />\nseason, and the other, a graduate, is<br />\nso busy that it is doubtful whether<br />\nhe will run. The squad as a whole<br />\nhas suffered most severe losses, so<br />\nthat the situation has only one parallel in the history of track at Hopkins\u2014that of 1900-01.<br />\nIn this year, however, a practically \"green\" team started on a path<br />\nof continuous victory which lasted<br />\nthree years, and a relay team of<br />\nthree freshmen and one upper classman was formed which scored fourteen victories and suffered but one<br />\ndefeat in two years. A record was<br />\nsmashed by this fast four which had<br />\nbeen considered almost \"unsmashable,\" and the whole team broke<br />\neight records in the course of its<br />\nbright career.<br />\nThese astonishing results, as was<br />\npointed out last Friday by Mr. England, the track coach, were due in<br />\na very great degree to the spirit and<br />\ndetermination of the squad, which<br />\nfaced the discouraging outlook with<br />\nreal Hopkins spirit. Mr. England,<br />\nin speaking of this great opportunity now for new men, called attention to the fact that in a dual<br />\nmeet there must be two or three<br />\nmen entered in each of thirteen<br />\nevents, making at least twenty-six<br />\nfirst-string men, and also three relay teams are to be entered at the<br />\nArmory meet. This shows bow<br />\nmany places there are to work for.<br />\nMr. England also thrilled the<br />\nhearts of the men by a vivid description of the two-mile race in<br />\nwhich Freddie Lee so covered himself with glory and brought cheers<br />\nfor Hopkins from eighteen thousand throats at the Northern Intercollegiates last spring when he led<br />\nthe field for over half the race and<br />\nfinally finished in the first five in<br />\nthis record-breaking event. With<br />\nsuch a picture as this before them,<br />\nthe men who are facing the difficult<br />\nproblem this year can have no lack<br />\nof inspiration.<br />\nManager Deems reported that the<br />\nschedule will likely be very similar<br />\nto that of last year, although but<br />\nfew dates are definitely set as yet.<br />\nIt is planned to include the following:<br />\nIndoors\u2014Armory Meet, George<br />\nWashington, Georgetown.<br />\nOutdoors\u2014Navy, Penn Relays,<br />\nSouth Atlantic Intercollegiates,<br />\nWashington and Lee, Lehigh.<br />\n(('ontinued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n5 FOR YOUR DEN 5<br /><br />\nCollege and Fraternity Stationery<br />\nBanquet and Dance Cards\u2014Invitations<br /><br />\nBeautiful College Pennants<br /><br />\nJAS.

The Belgians<br />\nneed clothes and provisions. It is<br />\nquite probable that Hopkins will be<br />\nunable to contribute any great<br />\namount of provisions, but it can<br />\ngive money and clothing. Harvard<br />\nand Princeton students packed barrels and boxes of second-hand suits,<br />\nshirts, underwear and other articles<br />\nwhich could be used by the Belgians<br />\nwho have lost their homes.
