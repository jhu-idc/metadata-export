News Letter: Concerning the<br />\ndiscussion of college spirit in your last issue, will<br />\nyou allow me the use of your columns for a<br />\npresentation of a definition of the words,forma-.<br />\nlated after the experience of several years at<br />\nHopkins? The humor of \"Freshman's\" remarks was apparent, but the sense was superficial. foolish and fallacious, \"College Spirit\"<br />\nin its true sense, stands for college fun and college worship. Standing for college fun it is the<br />\nemblem offree, independent minds enjoying the<br />\nfullest extent of straightforward, highmindecl<br />\npleasures; it is the incentive and producer of<br />\nthose enjoyments which college life offers, and<br />\nwhich no other branch of life affords. But<br />\nit is less emblematic of college fun than college<br />\nworship. It not merely requires the interest<br />\nof college at heart, and evidences of this interest; but also implies willingness for self sacrifice,<br />\nand readiness for the resolute denial of personal<br />\nadvantage if necessary to further the interests<br />\nof college.<br />\nFrom this abstract exposition of the term,<br />\nit is clearly seen that the pleasures of college life<br />\nare essentially of one's own making; that college spirit is entirely dependent on the individual efforts of the student; and that it is not a<br />\ntangible something floating around in the air<br />\nready to be gathered in by inactive young men.<br />\nThough the embryo is always present in the<br />\nvery atmosphere of a college, it requires to be<br />\nfostered by delicate attentions, and is not to be<br />\nseized without strenuous effort. Just as a man's<br />\nsuccess in life depends on his own exertions, so<br />\nthe pleasures derived from college spirit are entirely dependent on the attitude of the collegian;<br />\nfor college spirit, of all things, does not exist<br />\nof its own accord, but is made.<br />\nThe fact that a college is without dormitories<br />\nis by no means evidence final or conclusive<br />\nenough to establish a reputation for lack of<br />\nspirit. The pleasures of dormitory life are by no<br />\nmeans to be slighted, yet the lack of excitement<br />\nthus furnished is fundamentally only a superficial want, as the pleasures thus derived are<br />\nmainly superficial signs of college spirit, which<br />\nmay or may not indicate the deep-rooted pres-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nence of the true sentiment. The one great advantage of dormitory life is the promulgation of<br />\nassociation between man and man; advantages<br />\nwhich to a certain extent are lacking where the<br />\nstudents only work together fifteen hours per<br />\nweek. College spirit requires class spirit, and a<br />\nfraternal unity of feeling in the student body as<br />\na whole. Every man's motto at college should<br />\nbe: \"my college, my class, and then myself.\"<br />\nThe fundamental value of class contests lies in<br />\nthe spirit of oneness produced not only in each<br />\nclass but between the t No contestants. Class<br />\ncontests undeniably unite classes, and rrtake<br />\nmembers feel that they are a vital part of the<br />\nclass and of the institution; and this feeling<br />\nmust be established before any enjoyable demonstration of college spirit can be successfully<br />\nmade. A thoroughly organized class is thc best<br />\nnatural means of producing interest in other<br />\naffairs, as the immediate organization of Freshmen at Hopkins has year after year proved.<br />\nManifestations of college spirit should be made<br />\non every occasion. Here at Hopkins,the Football,<br />\nLaCrosse and Track and Field Teams are always<br />\nin need of men. If you are not heavy enough to<br />\nplay football, then unless you are totally unfit,<br />\nbecause of physical weakness, for any athletic<br />\nsport, at least make a hearty attempt for the<br />\nother teams. It is the plain duty of every man<br />\nto his alma mater: but of course only a small<br />\npercentage of the students enrolled at any college can make the athletic teams. The rest<br />\nshould make up the band of loyal supporters<br />\nwithout whom no team, however strong, can<br />\nachieve success. It is the experience of all ath_<br />\nletes that a band of enthusiastic \"rooters\" is<br />\nthe best incentive to good work. The record of<br />\nthe student body as\"rooters\"last year was far<br />\nmore creditable than ever before in the history<br />\nof dear old Tom Hopkins; they witnessed more<br />\ngames, and had a more systematic manner of<br />\ngiving vent to songs and yells than in former<br />\nyears. When the football team went up to<br />\nWestminster to contest with Western Maryland<br />\nCollege for the championship of the I. A. A. of<br />\nMd.,thanks to the efforts of the management to<br />\narouse interest and the liberal response of undergrads and graduate students, a party of about<br />\none hundred took the trip, and like a Roman<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\ncentury swept everything, including the town<br />\nand the championship, before it, in its majestic<br />\ncourse of glory. I might mention two all-important facts here: that occasion was momentous<br />\nin its inauguration of united support of teams<br />\nby the students, and incidentally every member<br />\nof the party had a royal good time. There will<br />\nbe occasions this year for similar demonstrations. On Saturday, November 24th, Hopkins<br />\nplays St. John's College, at Annapolis, and it<br />\nwill require great efforts on our part to snatch victory from their strong team. Let the precedent<br />\nof 1899 be followed,let an even greater crowd accompany the team, so that such occasions shall<br />\nbe traditional in future years for the great outpouring of the people.<br />\nThere are other means besides athletics for<br />\nthe display of college spirit. You know all<br />\nabout the unexcelled record of the musical clubs<br />\nlast year. The NEWS LETTER and the Hullabaloo are both college institutitions that, though<br />\nby no means faultless, reflect credit on the<br />\nUniversity. Surely it is an evidence of college<br />\nspirit to contribute some article or articles to<br />\nthese noble examples of contemporaneous literature. The pleasure of writing for these representative Hopkins institutions should not be<br />\nleft entirely to the editors, who, as I have frequently seen in the columns of the NEWS LETTER, earnestly desire the active co-operation of<br />\nthe general student body. That you subscribe<br />\nI take as a matter of course.<br />\nI have said that colleges pint is college worship and college fun; but I should have said college worship and the fun derived from such worship. The religions of the ancients were filled<br />\nwith forms and ceremonials, but the true religions were deeper-rooted in the hearts of the people because they worshipped at a common shrine'<br />\nCollege fun is an essential of college life, but the<br />\ntrue spirit, which I have tried to make clear,<br />\nshould prompt all fun. The practice of such college spirit will produce infinite pleasure in college and in after life, present tangible enjoyments, and future recollections.<br />\nBut above all else,remember that college spirit<br />\nis dependent on you and you alone.<br />\nAN OLD COLLEGE STUDENT,.<br />\nB.

The kindly inter<br />\nest shown enables us to hope that the tone of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER may be continually improved,<br />\nand always be, as has been said, \"an honor to<br />\nthe students and a credit to the University.\"<br />\nLet all non-subscribers consider the suggestion,<br />\nfor there is a very simple way by which they can<br />\npromote this end.<br />\nor or or<br />\nActive, proselyting political clubs are a new<br />\nfeature of life at the University, hatched in the<br />\nstrenuous times of the national campaign.

Straightway they repaired to a<br />\nlearned and benevolent griffin, who with the welfare of the young animals much at heart, was<br />\nmost pleased to impart the necessary instruction.<br />\nDaily they wended their way to his wood-seated<br />\nhaunt where they discussed many intricate propositions, made many intricate notes in their<br />\nbooks of guzzywee skin, and asked many unanswerable questions. At length one of the young<br />\nlogicians turned to his companion and said:<br />\n\"Tell me, I pray thee, what all this is about?\"<br />\n\"Verily,\" responded the bookerbus, \"I do not<br />\nknow.\"<br />\n\"Nor I,\" quoth the tom-tom.<br />\nWhereupon they all relapsed into attentive<br />\nsilence, with wise looks upon their faces, and<br />\nmuch confusion in their animal brains.<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\nIL<br />\nOn another occasion the animals,having great<br />\ndesire to become proficient in the art of public<br />\naddress, resolved themselves into an assembly<br />\nafter the manner of men, and secured as their<br />\ncensor a tetra-tongued animal from the bogs of<br />\nthe Rungleweed Rot. Now it happened that the<br />\nmost convenient place for assembly was in the<br />\nshade of the bingle tree, on the branches of which<br />\nthe birds of the rare were wont to sit and sing.<br />\n\"Truly,\" said the tetra-tongued censor from<br />\nthe bogs of the Rungleweed Rot, \"it is unbecoming that we disturb the singing of our<br />\nfair and feathered neighbors by untempered<br />\napplause.

U.,6:P.& S.,0.<br />\nIn an interesting game, Saturday, at Electric<br />\nPark, Hopkins with a seriously weakened team,<br />\nsucceeeded in defeating the College of Physicians<br />\nand Surgeons to the tune of 6 to 0. Hopkins<br />\nwent into the game badly crippled, for not only<br />\nwas she short two backs, McClintock and<br />\nRiggs, quarter-back, Meadows,and centre, Hancock, but several of the players who did enter<br />\nthe game were below their usual form on acccount of injuries sustained. The doctors had<br />\ngotten together their eleven only the Saturday<br />\nbefore, and consequently the team was semewhat new at the game. Hence the weakness of<br />\none side counterbalanced that of the other. In<br />\nthe game Hopkins clearly outplayed the P.& S.,<br />\nour interference being far superior to theirs, and<br />\nour backs doing decidedly better work. Tyler,<br />\nalthough a man who has been out of the game,<br />\nmade several splendid end runs, while captain<br />\nSayler, although injured, made the \"star\" play<br />\n<br />\nii<br />\n<br />\nof the afternoon by running three-fourths the<br />\nlength of the field, going through the entire<br />\nP. & S. eleven and scoring the only touchdown<br />\nof the game. Butler, Hopkins old standby, went<br />\ninto the game for the first time this season, and<br />\nmade his presence felt by opening up the P. & S.<br />\nline for heavy gains. Whitman took Hancock's<br />\nposition at centre, and Morse replaced Meadows<br />\nat quarter. The doctors line outweighed the<br />\nBlack and Blue, but notwithstanding this difference in weight, our men held fairly well. Everybody was expecting to see Hopkins score in the<br />\nsecond half, but although on one or two occasions she carried the ball to within 10 or 12<br />\nyards of the P. & S. goal, for some reason or<br />\nother, another touchdown wasn't made,the ball<br />\nalways being lost on downs.

In that part<br />\nof the prologue to Chaucer which speaks of \"A<br />\ngood Wyf was ther of bisyde Bathe\" there are to<br />\nbe found [L 487-8] the couplets:<br />\n\"She coude moche of wandring by the weye.<br />\nGat-tothed wasshe,soothly for to seye.\" This<br />\nphrase \"gat-tothed\" has for many years disturbed the minds of students of Chaucer.<br />\nSome have decided that this signifies lasciviousness; others thought that it possibly described her desire for travel. For in England and<br />\n<br />\nin Ireland it is believed that the country folk<br />\nsome years ago used to judge by the arrangement<br />\nof a child's teeth whether it should be a \"home<br />\nstayer\" or a traveller.<br />\nDr.Greene asked if any member of the class had<br />\never heard this saying, and although he had put<br />\nthis question to previous classes, this year is the<br />\nfirst time that any men have been found who<br />\nhad heard this expression. The men who heard<br />\nit before were: Lyman Murphy, Henry B. Law<br />\nand William B. Hill, who came across it while<br />\nrusticating in Hartford County, Md.<br />\nThe testimony of these men will gofar in clinching the argument that the \"good Wyf\" was a<br />\ntraveller and not a lascivious woman.<br />\nWWW<br />\n<br />\nTHE CIGARETTE BUSH.<br />\nWhin I git big I'm goin'<br />\nTo a country fur down South,<br />\nWhere I'll lay around all day<br />\nWith a cigarit in me mouth,<br />\nAn' puff like some ole chimny,<br />\nAn'fergit erbout me woes,<br />\nIn th' bright an' sunny land<br />\nWhere<br />\nTh'cigarit bush grows.<br />\nThere won't be none to break me up<br />\nWhin th' smoke curls round me head,<br />\nAn'I won't have ter chope th' stump<br />\nUntil it's limp an' dead;<br />\nThere'll be none to search me pockits,<br />\nNor to smell me reekin' close,<br />\nIn th' bright an' sunny land<br />\nWhere<br />\nTh'cigarit bush grows.<br />\n0 thim times is slow a-comin'<br />\nBut there comin' all th' same,<br />\nAn' it's Turkish Cross ter Richmonds<br />\nThet I'll be in the game;<br />\nWhin I'm old ernuff ter go away<br />\nAn' fergit me mortil throes,<br />\nIn th' bright an' sunny land<br />\nWhere<br />\nTh' cigarit bush grows.<br />\njOIIN C.

News Letter: Concerning the<br />\ndiscussion of college spirit in your last issue, will<br />\nyou allow me the use of your columns for a<br />\npresentation of a definition of the words,forma-.<br />\nlated after the experience of several years at<br />\nHopkins? The humor of \"Freshman's\" remarks was apparent, but the sense was superficial. foolish and fallacious, \"College Spirit\"<br />\nin its true sense, stands for college fun and college worship. Standing for college fun it is the<br />\nemblem offree, independent minds enjoying the<br />\nfullest extent of straightforward, highmindecl<br />\npleasures; it is the incentive and producer of<br />\nthose enjoyments which college life offers, and<br />\nwhich no other branch of life affords. But<br />\nit is less emblematic of college fun than college<br />\nworship. It not merely requires the interest<br />\nof college at heart, and evidences of this interest; but also implies willingness for self sacrifice,<br />\nand readiness for the resolute denial of personal<br />\nadvantage if necessary to further the interests<br />\nof college.<br />\nFrom this abstract exposition of the term,<br />\nit is clearly seen that the pleasures of college life<br />\nare essentially of one's own making; that college spirit is entirely dependent on the individual efforts of the student; and that it is not a<br />\ntangible something floating around in the air<br />\nready to be gathered in by inactive young men.<br />\nThough the embryo is always present in the<br />\nvery atmosphere of a college, it requires to be<br />\nfostered by delicate attentions, and is not to be<br />\nseized without strenuous effort. Just as a man's<br />\nsuccess in life depends on his own exertions, so<br />\nthe pleasures derived from college spirit are entirely dependent on the attitude of the collegian;<br />\nfor college spirit, of all things, does not exist<br />\nof its own accord, but is made.<br />\nThe fact that a college is without dormitories<br />\nis by no means evidence final or conclusive<br />\nenough to establish a reputation for lack of<br />\nspirit. The pleasures of dormitory life are by no<br />\nmeans to be slighted, yet the lack of excitement<br />\nthus furnished is fundamentally only a superficial want, as the pleasures thus derived are<br />\nmainly superficial signs of college spirit, which<br />\nmay or may not indicate the deep-rooted pres-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n41<br />\n'<br /><br />\nence of the true sentiment. The one great advantage of dormitory life is the promulgation of<br />\nassociation between man and man; advantages<br />\nwhich to a certain extent are lacking where the<br />\nstudents only work together fifteen hours per<br />\nweek. College spirit requires class spirit, and a<br />\nfraternal unity of feeling in the student body as<br />\na whole. Every man's motto at college should<br />\nbe: \"my college, my class, and then myself.\"<br />\nThe fundamental value of class contests lies in<br />\nthe spirit of oneness produced not only in each<br />\nclass but between the t No contestants. Class<br />\ncontests undeniably unite classes, and rrtake<br />\nmembers feel that they are a vital part of the<br />\nclass and of the institution; and this feeling<br />\nmust be established before any enjoyable demonstration of college spirit can be successfully<br />\nmade. A thoroughly organized class is thc best<br />\nnatural means of producing interest in other<br />\naffairs, as the immediate organization of Freshmen at Hopkins has year after year proved.<br />\nManifestations of college spirit should be made<br />\non every occasion. Here at Hopkins,the Football,<br />\nLaCrosse and Track and Field Teams are always<br />\nin need of men. If you are not heavy enough to<br />\nplay football, then unless you are totally unfit,<br />\nbecause of physical weakness, for any athletic<br />\nsport, at least make a hearty attempt for the<br />\nother teams. It is the plain duty of every man<br />\nto his alma mater: but of course only a small<br />\npercentage of the students enrolled at any college can make the athletic teams. The rest<br />\nshould make up the band of loyal supporters<br />\nwithout whom no team, however strong, can<br />\nachieve success. It is the experience of all ath_<br />\nletes that a band of enthusiastic \"rooters\" is<br />\nthe best incentive to good work. The record of<br />\nthe student body as\"rooters\"last year was far<br />\nmore creditable than ever before in the history<br />\nof dear old Tom Hopkins; they witnessed more<br />\ngames, and had a more systematic manner of<br />\ngiving vent to songs and yells than in former<br />\nyears. When the football team went up to<br />\nWestminster to contest with Western Maryland<br />\nCollege for the championship of the I. A. A. of<br />\nMd.,thanks to the efforts of the management to<br />\narouse interest and the liberal response of undergrads and graduate students, a party of about<br />\none hundred took the trip, and like a Roman<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\ncentury swept everything, including the town<br />\nand the championship, before it, in its majestic<br />\ncourse of glory. I might mention two all-important facts here: that occasion was momentous<br />\nin its inauguration of united support of teams<br />\nby the students, and incidentally every member<br />\nof the party had a royal good time. There will<br />\nbe occasions this year for similar demonstrations. On Saturday, November 24th, Hopkins<br />\nplays St. John's College, at Annapolis, and it<br />\nwill require great efforts on our part to snatch victory from their strong team. Let the precedent<br />\nof 1899 be followed,let an even greater crowd accompany the team, so that such occasions shall<br />\nbe traditional in future years for the great outpouring of the people.<br />\nThere are other means besides athletics for<br />\nthe display of college spirit. You know all<br />\nabout the unexcelled record of the musical clubs<br />\nlast year. The NEWS LETTER and the Hullabaloo are both college institutitions that, though<br />\nby no means faultless, reflect credit on the<br />\nUniversity. Surely it is an evidence of college<br />\nspirit to contribute some article or articles to<br />\nthese noble examples of contemporaneous literature. The pleasure of writing for these representative Hopkins institutions should not be<br />\nleft entirely to the editors, who, as I have frequently seen in the columns of the NEWS LETTER, earnestly desire the active co-operation of<br />\nthe general student body. That you subscribe<br />\nI take as a matter of course.<br />\nI have said that colleges pint is college worship and college fun; but I should have said college worship and the fun derived from such worship. The religions of the ancients were filled<br />\nwith forms and ceremonials, but the true religions were deeper-rooted in the hearts of the people because they worshipped at a common shrine'<br />\nCollege fun is an essential of college life, but the<br />\ntrue spirit, which I have tried to make clear,<br />\nshould prompt all fun.

An enforced delay in the<br />\ndistribution of the issue called forth many inquiries as to the why and wherefore,which were very<br />\ngratifying to the staff, as showing that the paper<br />\nhas won the favor and confidence of the students.<br />\nThe year ending in June was the most prosperous and marked by the greatest progress of any<br />\nyear in the history of the paper. The kindly inter<br />\nest shown enables us to hope that the tone of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER may be continually improved,<br />\nand always be, as has been said, \"an honor to<br />\nthe students and a credit to the University.\"<br />\nLet all non-subscribers consider the suggestion,<br />\nfor there is a very simple way by which they can<br />\npromote this end.<br />\nor or or<br />\nActive, proselyting political clubs are a new<br />\nfeature of life at the University, hatched in the<br />\nstrenuous times of the national campaign.

Straightway they repaired to a<br />\nlearned and benevolent griffin, who with the welfare of the young animals much at heart, was<br />\nmost pleased to impart the necessary instruction.<br />\nDaily they wended their way to his wood-seated<br />\nhaunt where they discussed many intricate propositions, made many intricate notes in their<br />\nbooks of guzzywee skin, and asked many unanswerable questions. At length one of the young<br />\nlogicians turned to his companion and said:<br />\n\"Tell me, I pray thee, what all this is about?\"<br />\n\"Verily,\" responded the bookerbus, \"I do not<br />\nknow.\"<br />\n\"Nor I,\" quoth the tom-tom.<br />\nWhereupon they all relapsed into attentive<br />\nsilence, with wise looks upon their faces, and<br />\nmuch confusion in their animal brains.<br />\nW<br /><br />\nIL<br />\nOn another occasion the animals,having great<br />\ndesire to become proficient in the art of public<br />\naddress, resolved themselves into an assembly<br />\nafter the manner of men, and secured as their<br />\ncensor a tetra-tongued animal from the bogs of<br />\nthe Rungleweed Rot. Now it happened that the<br />\nmost convenient place for assembly was in the<br />\nshade of the bingle tree, on the branches of which<br />\nthe birds of the rare were wont to sit and sing.<br />\n\"Truly,\" said the tetra-tongued censor from<br />\nthe bogs of the Rungleweed Rot, \"it is unbecoming that we disturb the singing of our<br />\nfair and feathered neighbors by untempered<br />\napplause.

In<br />\nthe game Hopkins clearly outplayed the P.&amp; S.,<br />\nour interference being far superior to theirs, and<br />\nour backs doing decidedly better work. Tyler,<br />\nalthough a man who has been out of the game,<br />\nmade several splendid end runs, while captain<br />\nSayler, although injured, made the \"star\" play<br /><br />\nii<br /><br />\nof the afternoon by running three-fourths the<br />\nlength of the field, going through the entire<br />\nP. &amp; S. eleven and scoring the only touchdown<br />\nof the game. Butler, Hopkins old standby, went<br />\ninto the game for the first time this season, and<br />\nmade his presence felt by opening up the P. &amp; S.<br />\nline for heavy gains. Whitman took Hancock's<br />\nposition at centre, and Morse replaced Meadows<br />\nat quarter. The doctors line outweighed the<br />\nBlack and Blue, but notwithstanding this difference in weight, our men held fairly well. Everybody was expecting to see Hopkins score in the<br />\nsecond half, but although on one or two occasions she carried the ball to within 10 or 12<br />\nyards of the P. &amp; S. goal, for some reason or<br />\nother, another touchdown wasn't made,the ball<br />\nalways being lost on downs. The playing.<br />\nseemed to lack sufficient snap.<br />\nNext comes Western Maryland for the championship (Nov. 3) and before that date several<br />\nhard practices are needed.<br />\nThe line up is as followsP. &amp; S.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS.<br /><br />\nPOSITION.<br /><br />\nGillespie,<br />\nButler,<br />\nBlanck,<br />\nWhitman,<br />\nYearley,<br />\nBacon,<br />\nNelson,<br />\nMorse,<br />\nTyler,<br />\nSayler,<br />\nBruton,<br /><br />\nSudler\u2022<br />\nLeft end.<br />\nNichols.<br />\nLeft tackle,<br />\nE.E.

In that part<br />\nof the prologue to Chaucer which speaks of \"A<br />\ngood Wyf was ther of bisyde Bathe\" there are to<br />\nbe found [L 487-8] the couplets:<br />\n\"She coude moche of wandring by the weye.<br />\nGat-tothed wasshe,soothly for to seye.\" This<br />\nphrase \"gat-tothed\" has for many years disturbed the minds of students of Chaucer.<br />\nSome have decided that this signifies lasciviousness; others thought that it possibly described her desire for travel. For in England and<br /><br />\nin Ireland it is believed that the country folk<br />\nsome years ago used to judge by the arrangement<br />\nof a child's teeth whether it should be a \"home<br />\nstayer\" or a traveller.<br />\nDr.Greene asked if any member of the class had<br />\never heard this saying, and although he had put<br />\nthis question to previous classes, this year is the<br />\nfirst time that any men have been found who<br />\nhad heard this expression. The men who heard<br />\nit before were: Lyman Murphy, Henry B. Law<br />\nand William B. Hill, who came across it while<br />\nrusticating in Hartford County, Md.<br />\nThe testimony of these men will gofar in clinching the argument that the \"good Wyf\" was a<br />\ntraveller and not a lascivious woman.<br />\nWWW<br /><br />\nTHE CIGARETTE BUSH.<br />\nWhin I git big I'm goin'<br />\nTo a country fur down South,<br />\nWhere I'll lay around all day<br />\nWith a cigarit in me mouth,<br />\nAn' puff like some ole chimny,<br />\nAn'fergit erbout me woes,<br />\nIn th' bright an' sunny land<br />\nWhere<br />\nTh'cigarit bush grows.<br />\nThere won't be none to break me up<br />\nWhin th' smoke curls round me head,<br />\nAn'I won't have ter chope th' stump<br />\nUntil it's limp an' dead;<br />\nThere'll be none to search me pockits,<br />\nNor to smell me reekin' close,<br />\nIn th' bright an' sunny land<br />\nWhere<br />\nTh'cigarit bush grows.<br />\n0 thim times is slow a-comin'<br />\nBut there comin' all th' same,<br />\nAn' it's Turkish Cross ter Richmonds<br />\nThet I'll be in the game;<br />\nWhin I'm old ernuff ter go away<br />\nAn' fergit me mortil throes,<br />\nIn th' bright an' sunny land<br />\nWhere<br />\nTh' cigarit bush grows.<br />\njOIIN C.
