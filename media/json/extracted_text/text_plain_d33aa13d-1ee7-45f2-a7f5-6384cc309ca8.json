Yet our<br />\nUniversity more favorably located than any of the others, cannot<br />\nfind a place where it can be made a paying sport.<br />\nThat splendid stage of pep, in which the football season leaves<br />\nthe fan, is permitted to die down until the spring sports begin simply<br />\nbecause the sportlover has no outlet for his enthusiasm.
