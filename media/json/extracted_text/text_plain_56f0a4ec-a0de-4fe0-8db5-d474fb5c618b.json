Under the<br />\nwill of John Work Garrett, the<br />\nmansion and the grounds at 4545<br />\nNorth Charles Street, his collection of rare maps, books, pamphlets, coins and medals, Oriental ceramics, and most of his<br />\ncelebrated collection of autographs were left to Hopkins. It<br />\nis maintained by the Evergreen<br />\nHouse Foundation, an educational 'trust set up in 1952 by the<br />\nwill of Alice,Warder Garrett, as<br />\na research library and mUseum<br />\nfor the benefit of the University<br />\nand the people ,of Baltimore.<br />\nThe main house, a classical<br />\nrevival structure, was built in<br />\nthe 1850's. In 1885 a north wing<br />\nwas erected, joining the house<br />\nby an archway. This part became the Far East Room, where<br />\nthere has been assembled a fine<br />\noollection of Oriental art objects.<br />\nAnother part became a handsome<br />\nlittle theatre, where amateur<br />\ntheatricals were given, or friends<br />\nwere entertained with music.<br />\nNew - Library<br />\nThe most important addition<br />\nto the house is the \"new library\"<br />\nat the southeast corner of the<br />\nmansion overlooking the Italian<br />\ngarden. This single, lofty chamber shelters 8,700 choice volumes. There are, elsewhere in<br />\nthe building, more than 26,000<br />\nother volumes, not in the rare<br />\nbook category, but of wide scOpe<br />\nand importance. In one classification of books, this room is of<br />\nparticular interest to students.<br />\nThis category is in the room devoted to texts on international<br />\nlaw and diplomacy.

Such a situation will leave the Homewood<br />\nSquad with a 2-1 record and .667 percentage, while<br />\nliampden-Sydney and Western Maryland follow at 2-1-1<br />\n(.625), Randolf-Macon trailing with a 2-1-2 (.600) mark.<br />\nA victory by either H-S or R-M will give the trium-unit tailback Henry Ciccarone hurdles the Dickinson line for a short gain in last week's<br />\nphant club the title, the former with a 3-1 log (.750) or 47-0Second<br />\nvictory over the Red Devils.

G-Burg outmanned the Blue Jay squad with<br />\nmore experience, a heavier line<br />\nand speedy backs.<br />\nFrom the opening kick-off<br />\nuntil the beginning of the second half, Gettysburg dominated<br />\nplay. The first score of the afternoon was set up when a bullet<br />\npunt fell dead on the Hopkins<br />\none yard line. A play up the<br />\nmiddle netted no yardage, and<br />\non the next play, quarterback<br />\nHank Schaefer was caught behind the goal line for a two<br />\npoint safety.<br />\n<br />\nburg thirty-two but on a fourth<br />\ndown pass schaefer over-shot<br />\nhis intended receiver. The Bullets took over, ran a series of<br />\nplays, and were then forced to<br />\nkick. gopkins picked up the ball<br />\nand drove down to the Gettysburg thirty, where on a fourth<br />\ndown play the pass from Schaefer to halfback Conrad Schwab<br />\nwas caught out of bounds. From<br />\nthere Gettysburg took over and<br />\nran out the clock.<br />\nThe frosh record for the year<br />\nwas two won, one lost, and one<br />\ntie. The victors came over Baltimore Junior College (6-3) and<br />\nFranklin and Marshall (28-0).<br />\nThe tie was with Pennsylvania<br />\nMilitary College (6-6) and the<br />\nloss to Gettysburg.<br />\nCoach Scott felt this season<br />\nhad been as equally successful<br />\nas those of the past. The Jays<br />\nentered the season with a small<br />\nsquad that lacked experience<br />\nand weight..In order to overcome<br />\nthese deficits they developed<br />\ngreat hustle and competitiveness, which was best exemplified<br />\nin the last two games, in which<br />\nthe opposing lines out-weighed<br />\nthe Hopkins forwards by twenty<br />\npounds per man.<br />\n<br />\nJays Control Play<br />\nIn the second quarter G-Burg<br />\nhalfback Ron Councill broke<br />\nloose for a forty-six yard jaunt<br />\nto net the day's only touchdown<br />\nfor Getysburg.

He explained the purpose of the meeting and the purpose of the U.N.<br />\nFellowship program which was<br />\nresponsible for the Program. The<br />\nProgram was organized to help<br />\nkeep the public informed as to<br />\nthe U.N.'s activities.

At the present time<br />\nhe is drafting the first text book<br />\non the United Nations. Because<br />\nof language difficulties, the<br />\nwriter missed much of Dr.<br />\nRamos' speech. However, he did<br />\nmake the point that the U.N.<br />\nhad helped to build them up and<br /><br />\nthat they were now helping to<br />\nbuild up less developed countries.<br />\nThe last speaker was Mr. Jitt<br />\nof India, a correspondent for<br />\n\"The Times of India.\" Mr. Jitt<br />\nnoted that the United Nations is<br />\na part of every-day life in India; and that U.N. beliefs concerning the settlement of its<br />\nproblems are quite similar to<br />\nIndia's.
