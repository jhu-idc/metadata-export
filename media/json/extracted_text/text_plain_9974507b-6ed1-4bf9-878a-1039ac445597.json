According to Armstrong,<br />\nhowever, one sentence in the current tenure regulations has recently come under the Academic<br />\nCouncil's scrutiny.<br />\nThe sentence reads, \"The<br />\nAcademic Council may recommend tenure to an associate professor in exceptional circumstances, where it is in the<br />\ncompelling interest of the University to do so . . . .\"<br />\nAccording to Armstrong, the<br />\nsentence is \"ill-defined\" and, as<br />\na result, has become effectively<br />\n\"inoperative.\" One current concern of the Academic Council,<br />\n<br />\nCouncil seeks more<br />\nactivities for students<br />\nby Jon Stempel<br />\nStudent Council President Scott<br />\nFitzGerald exhorted the Council<br />\nto look ahead to next semester<br />\nand proposed several ideas for<br />\nimproving the quality of life at<br />\nHopkins for the Council to consider next semester.<br />\nFitzGerald listed several of the<br />\nmajor activities that Council initiated this semester, including<br />\nFall Fest, Hoppy Hour, and P.T.<br />\nFlaggs night, and reminded the<br />\nCouncil of some of the major<br />\nacademic issues tackled during<br />\nthe semester, notably the proposed revisions in add-drop<br />\ndeadlines.<br />\n\"I think we did a really good<br />\njob, \" he said. \"We got a lot<br />\ndone, but we should look forward<br />\nto next semester.\"<br />\nOn the activities side, FitzGerald proposed that the Council sponsor \"at least two quad<br />\nparties, like Fall Fest, when it's<br />\nwarm,\" and at least one more<br />\nP.T.

First, contended<br />\nNorton, El Salvador's president was nervous<br />\nabout the potential for the Democrats to con(trol U.S. foreign policy in the near future. In<br />\nresponse, Duarte accepted the peace plan in<br />\nan attempt to establish conncections with the<br />\nDemocrats and to distance himself from the<br />\nReagan Administration.<br />\nSecond, Norton expressed the possibility<br />\nthat \"Duarte saw the plan as a way of framing himself as a peacemaker again,\" because<br />\n\"analysis of the plan shows that little is required of the Salvadorans.\"<br />\nThe peace plan calls upon El Salvador to<br />\ntake steps to achieve a cease fire in El<br />\nSalvador and to grant amnesty to political<br />\nprisoners.

Traditionally,<br />\nthe policy holds that tenure will<br />\nnot be given until full professorship has been attained.<br />\nMuller suggested that, as<br />\nrecently as twenty years ago,<br />\ntenure was not much of an issue<br />\nbecause at that time, a greater<br />\npercentage of scholars were being promoted to full professorships. \"Now,\" he said, \"people honestly don't know whether<br />\nthey will get tenure after associate<br />\nprofessorship.<br />\n\"A couple of years ago, we<br />\nwere looking at people getting attractive offers of associate professorships with tenure from<br />\nother places, \" said Muller.<br />\n\"[We have a feeling that] we are<br />\nlosing and not attracting people<br />\nbecause we cannot give them<br />\ntenure as associate professors.\"<br />\nMuller said that a subcommittee was formed at that time to examine tenure policy at Hopkins.<br />\nIt modified tenure regulations by<br />\npermitting tenure to be given at<br />\nthe associate professor level in<br />\nexceptional cases.<br />\nMuller said that the changes<br />\nmade two years ago did not address the issue properly. \"I think<br />\nthere is a continuing disposition<br />\nthat there should be some changes<br />\nin the [tenure] procedure,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"[but] if you were to ask me<br />\nwhere this will all come out, I<br />\nhonestly don't know.\"<br />\nThe discussion of tenure continued with the issue of mandatory retirement for faculty<br />\nmembers. As of last year, the<br />\nfederal law regarding mandatory<br />\nretirement at age seventy was<br />\nchanged; under the new law,<br />\n<br />\nmandatory retirement can no<br />\nlonger be based on age. Universities unsuccessfully attempted to<br />\nbe exempted from the law;<br />\nhowever, they were given a year<br />\ngrace period.<br />\nMuller said that the issue is<br />\nwhether Hopkins should use the<br />\nexemption. He raised four problems with professors not retiring at age seventy.<br />\nThe first point was one of expense. \"It is not so much a question of paying people,\"he said,<br />\nbut rather the University's continued contribution to employee<br />\nbenefits for retirement years. The<br />\nUniversity contributes more<br />\nmoney for a retirement period<br />\nnecessarily shortened by continued employment.<br />\nMuller raised in his second<br />\npoint whether professors who<br />\nwork past age seventy should<br />\ncontinue to keep offices and<br />\nlaboratory space, which would<br />\nsuggest conflict with newer<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nFurthermore, said Muller,<br />\n\"tenure used to be a commitment<br />\nuntil retirement. Now, it's virtually a lifetime commitment.\"<br />\nFinally, Muller suggested that<br />\nthe issue of tenure could take on<br />\nnew meaning because it guarantees employment for a long<br />\nperiod of time. \"Tenure has<br />\nnever been an absolute right,<br />\nhe said. He spoke of the possibility of creating an evaluation<br />\nsystem because \"you're going to<br />\nmake a lifetime commitment to<br />\npeople and can't dismiss them on<br />\naccount of age,\"he said. Muller<br />\nmentioned that another option<br />\nmight be to hire professors on a<br />\ncontract basis.<br />\nHe noted that this policy may<br />\nnot pose a big problem. \"It's an<br />\nerroneous assumption to believe<br />\nthat faculty members will want to<br />\nstay here forever,\" he said.<br />\nIn the interview, Muller also<br />\ndiscussed the progress of the<br />\n$450 million Campaign for Johns<br />\nHopkins. Last month, the campaign reached the $380 million<br />\nmark. Muller expected the campaign to reach its goal by<br />\n<br />\nOPKINSSPRINGBREAKFLINGS<br />\nWith The Travel Connection<br />\n'Your connection To'The World<br />\n<br />\n467-9300<br />\nConveniently Located In The Rotunda Mall<br />\nUp The Ramp From Giant, Via Hopkins Shuttle<br />\nOr Just Call Our University Travel Specialists Today !!!!<br />\n<br />\nARUBA CONNECTION<br />\n7 NIGHTS (March 20-27)<br />\n<br />\nBARBADOS CONNECTION<br />\n<br />\ntr.$69?<br />\np.p.db<br />\n13-13.cibl\u2022<br />\nfrom<br />\n<br />\nCANCUN CONNECTION<br />\n<br />\nfrom<br />\n<br />\n7 NIGHTS (MARCH 20-27)<br />\n<br />\nCAYMAN IS.

He said that the<br />\nUniversity intends to extend fundraising efforts into 1990 to meet<br />\nthese \"more urgent\" needs.<br />\nHe explained that this extension<br />\ndoes not constitute an increase in<br />\nthe goal of the campaign, but<br />\nwould promote a \"cluster of<br />\nmini-campaigns under the<br />\numbrella\u2014the Campaign for<br />\nJohns Hopkins.\"<br />\nFinally, Muller expressed some<br />\nthoughts about his recent trip to<br />\nMoscow.

It reflects the university's commitment to its immeasurably valuable recourse: the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nThe Academic Council of the Homewood Schools<br />\nat present is attempting to redefine policy towards<br />\ngranting tenure to associate professors. Two years<br />\nago, the Council changed policy from not giving<br />\nassociate professors tenure to giving it in \"...exceptional circumstances where it is in the compelling interest of the University to do so...\" The Council feels this policy is too vaguely worded to adequately guide them in tenure decisions.<br />\nThe disposition to change policy two years ago<br />\nwas motivated by a perception that associate professors were being lured to other institutions which<br />\nwere offering associate professorships with tenure.<br />\nRecognizing certain problems with regualarly offering tenure to associate professors, they struck<br />\nupon the \"exceptional circumstance\" compromise.<br />\nThe new policy, as Muller described \"has caused more problems than it has solved.\" Proposals<br />\nto rectify the situation include granting tenure to<br />\nassociate professors as a separate process from promotion to the rank of associate professor, and<br />\nregualarly granting associate profesoors tenure except in some circumstances.<br />\nThe issue, as complicated as it is, is made even<br />\n<br />\nmore so because federal law mandating retirement<br />\nat age 70 as been struck down. Universities, though<br />\ntrying to gain permanent exemption from the law,<br />\nwere granted a seven year exemption only. This<br />\nmeans as of 1994, professors can not be made to<br />\nretire on account of age.<br />\nThe commitments to university-tenured faculty,<br />\nby means of employee retirement benefits, office<br />\nspace etc., are significant. For good or bad, mandatory retirement ensured a certain rate of turnover<br />\nof professors. Hopkins is concerned that the lifting<br />\nof the law, by extending the high end of faculty age,<br />\nand tenuring associate professors, by extending the<br />\nlow end of faculty age, will pinch the institution<br />\nfinancially and physically. All of this is beside its<br />\nconcern about reducing the standard of professors.<br />\nTo respond to the implicit danger of life-long<br />\ntenure, the University is considering periodic non<br />\nage-related evaluation of faculty, or hiring by contracts. Both of these are novel and worriesome<br />\nsolutions.<br />\nFinding the best solution to these problems will<br />\nnot be easy. The Academic Council is well-advised,<br />\nhowever, to carefully consider what standards are<br />\nused for the granting of tenure. Furthermore, it cannot relax its commitment to tenured faculty and must<br />\nreassert this commitment while the tenuous issue<br />\nof their future is being discussed.<br />\n<br />\nWWWWITITTIVV1717<br />\n<br />\nA Semester's Tidings<br />\nIt was not a thrilling semester for the Hopkins<br />\nnewspaper business. It lacked firebombings or shanty arrests, university bond issues, fraternity newsletters, or even WJHU power boosts.<br />\nIn fact, the biggest story of the semester was not<br />\neven a story in itself. The report of the Human<br />\nClimate Task Force Committee, while a substancial document, is really only important as it can<br />\nserve as a catalyst for reform and change.<br />\nHomewood, however, is by no means at a standstill. The construction continues, the money comes<br />\nin through the Campaign, plans are moving for student housing renovations and athletic center additions and a self-evaluation by the Arts and Sciences<br />\nand Engineering academic departments is (over)due<br />\nto begin.<br />\nAll of this is exciting. But frustration tinges this<br />\nexcitement. These projects and others will take<br />\ntime\u2014time short in the University's history perhaps,<br />\n<br />\nbut long in terms of an undergraduate career. To<br />\nbe concerned at all requires looking beyond one's<br />\nown career. Concern manifests the affection one has<br />\nfor the alma mater, and maybe a little well-wishing<br />\nfor future undergraduates.<br />\nSo undergraduates hope, with guarded optimism,<br />\nthat the results of today's efforts pay off. Maybe<br />\nthis sort of thing has been around as long as there<br />\nhave been institutions with a future to look foward<br />\nto. Something feels different about Homewood now,<br />\nhowever. It feels like the plans are more numerous<br />\nthan a couple of years ago. It also feels like there<br />\nis a new enhanced receptivity to undergraduate concerns. We can only hope that this is true. Also, we<br />\ncan give our input and make improvements.<br />\nThe item of our biggest news story concretized<br />\nsome directions for the University to move.

It was no surprise, then, when he spoke to the<br />\nCollege Republicans on Monday,<br />\nDecember 7, on that subject. Dr.<br />\nHanke's credentials and expertise<br />\non the subject speak for<br />\nthemselves. He served as Senior<br />\nEconomist on the President's<br />\nCouncil for Economic Advisers<br />\nfrom 1981-82. He has worked<br />\nclosely with David Stockman on<br />\na number of privatization projects<br />\nranging from public water works<br />\nto western grazing lands.<br />\nWashington Post columnist Jack<br />\nAnderson calls Hanke \"the key<br />\nproponent of privatizing.\" Hanke<br />\nis regarded as one of the nation's<br />\nof<br />\nscholars<br />\nforemost<br />\nprivatization.<br />\nMany people are unfamiliar<br />\nwith the notion of privatization.<br />\nHanke explains in the introduction to Prospectsfor Privatization<br />\nthat it is simply \"the transfer of<br />\nassets or service functions from<br />\npublic to private ownership or<br />\ncontrol.\" There are several<br />\nreasons that privatization is<br />\ndesperately called for in contemporary American politics.<br />\nUndoubtedly the most important one is the mandate for the<br />\nlocus of ownership to be in the<br />\nprivate, not the public, sphere.<br />\nHanke agreed with this issue as<br />\nthe priority of privatization by<br />\nstating, \"One thing that<br />\ndistinguishes communism from<br />\ncapitalism, according to Engels<br />\nand Marx, is 'the abolition of<br />\nprivate property.' In order to<br />\npreserve the individual liberties of<br />\nevery American's fundamental<br />\nright to property, it is necessary<br />\n<br />\nto place as many things as possible in the private domain.\"<br />\nA second reason for privatization concerns the fact that public<br />\nlands generate large negative cash<br />\nflows. Privatizing them will<br />\neliminate these annual losses that<br />\ntaxpayers must currently fund.<br />\nPrivatizing these lands also<br />\neliminates the capital carrying<br />\ncosts associated with these lands.<br />\nA third reason supporting<br />\nprivatization is the increase in<br />\nproductivity that will follow from<br />\na transfer of lands into the private<br />\nsector. Of the twelve states in the<br />\nwestern United States, all of them<br />\ncontain some public lands. This<br />\nland\u2014a total of 686 million<br />\nacres\u2014is completely socialized.<br />\nWere these lands sovereign, they<br />\nwould comprise the third largest<br />\nsocialist nation in the world,<br />\nbehind the U.S.S.R. and China.<br />\nBy privatizing these lands and<br />\ndesocializing them, their productivity will naturally increase. Recent studies by Hanke have<br />\nshown in one case that privatizing western timber lands would<br />\nimprove their productivity twelve<br />\nand a half times.<br />\nPrivatizing these timber lands<br />\nwould allow the trees to be cut<br />\nwhen they mature instead of forcing a conformity to government<br />\ncutting rates. These low government cutting rates cause overmaturity in timber lands, leading<br />\nto environmental decay and the<br />\nincrease in likelihood of forest<br />\nfires.<br />\nA fourth reason for privatization is that it enhances the environmental and wildlife value of<br />\nthe area. For many of the same<br />\nreasons mentioned above, a<br />\nprivatized area is a more produc-<br />\n<br />\nSee PRIVATIZE, 8<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nFlory Ware, Lisa Weisbord<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nEly Brown, Jonathan Engler<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jon Stempel<br />\nPhil Gochenour<br />\nSharon Fischman, Jay Lechtman<br />\nJoseph Gergyes, Volney Sheen<br />\nVandana Kumra<br />\nDanny Kofos, Christopher Szeles . .<br />\nEric Ruck<br />\nRichard Bell, Bernard Liu<br />\n<br />\nEditors<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nLayout Editors<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nArts Editor<br />\nFeatures Editors<br />\nScience Editors<br />\nBooks Editor<br />\n. .

Lee Davis \"<br />\nThe screaming grew louder,<br />\nmore confusing. Was a woman<br />\nbeing assaulted or having a good<br />\ntime Should I get up or should<br />\nI keep sleeping? In a four a.m.<br />\nfog, my brain didn't have any<br />\nready answers. The shriek came<br />\nagain. I jumped up and ran to the<br />\nwindow. Cold air streamed into<br />\nthe room as I stuck my head out<br />\ninto the night.<br />\nI could see her across the<br />\nstreet, on the corner of 33rd and<br />\nSt. Paul. An indistinct, dark<br />\nshape was chasing her. With<br />\nanother shriek she turned to push<br />\nit away. I quickly pulled on some<br />\npants. I decided to take one more<br />\nlook before I called security, and<br />\nI was glad I did, because when I<br />\nagain invited the winter in<br />\nthrough my window, she was in<br />\nanother girl's arms, and they<br />\nwere falling over each other<br />\nlaughing.

Like spiders, the<br />\nmajority of them are innocuous,<br />\nbut, like spiders, a rare few are<br />\ndeadly. This year, our campus<br />\nand its citizens haven't experienced the drawn-gun muggings and<br />\nother assaults that we have seen<br />\nin the past, but it would be a<br />\nmistake to attribute this to increased security or augmented<br />\nstudent awareness of the city's<br />\ndangers. I can't help but think<br />\nplain luck has played the major<br />\nrole, and the problem with luck<br />\nis that sooner or later it runs out.<br />\nThere is a danger involved in<br />\nunneeded screaming. Remember<br />\n<br />\nthe story of the boy who was a<br />\nshepard of the town's flock? To<br />\nhave a little fun, he shouted from<br />\nthe hilltops \"Wolf! Wolf!\" and<br />\nsent the townsfolk scurrying up to<br />\nthe fields. They admonished him,<br />\nbut soon after this rebuke he<br />\nagain cried \"Wolf!\" with the<br />\nsame result. When the wolf finally arrived, no one believed the<br />\nboy's cries, and many of those<br />\nsheep felt the beast's bite. I don't<br />\nrecall if the boy was eaten as<br />\nwell, but if he wasn't, he should<br />\nhave been.<br />\nAlice, who is a happy-go-lucky<br />\ntype and often screams because<br />\nshe is drunk or rambunctious,<br />\nmay never walk alone and stay in<br />\nwell-lighted areas.

Last year, while leaving<br />\nthe hallowed halls of the<br />\nGatehouse at about 4:30 a.m., I<br />\nwas actually chased by two<br />\ngentlemen from Wyman Park<br />\nwith more than a little quick cash<br />\non their minds.

But what is also apparent<br />\nis that many of these groups have<br />\nhad to undergo many changes<br />\nfrom their punk beginnings in<br />\norder to gain present-day<br />\npopularity.<br />\nOne such group is The Alarm.<br />\nStarting off around 1977, The<br />\nAlarm came in on the very beginnings of the Punk movement, and<br />\nincorporated the fierce guitar<br />\nferocity of the times with a rootsy,, acoustic-guitar/harmonica<br />\nstyle of music (later to be called<br />\ncowpunk) that was vaguely<br />\nreminiscent of such folk artists as<br />\nBob Dylan. Also like Dylan,<br />\nthese were four guys with<br />\nsomething to say. While most<br />\npunk bands of the time were content to say that the world sucked,<br />\na statement that pop-critic Lester<br />\nBangs described as being<br />\n\"somewhat, ah, insufficient,\"<br />\nThe Alarm were busy making the<br />\nstatement that the world sucked,<br />\nbut if you stood up for and believed in yourself, and if we all hung<br />\ntogether, things mightn't<br />\nnecessarily get better, but life<br />\nsure would be a lot more<br />\ntolerable. Such was the message<br />\nof their first two albums, The<br />\nStand (an EP) and Declaration.<br />\nWith their third album,<br />\nStrength, it was clear from the<br />\nopening synthesizer sequencing<br />\n_ of the first track, \"Knife Edge,\"<br />\nthat some changes were in the air.<br />\nAll four tracks of the first side<br />\nsmacked of an attempt at AOR<br />\nradio airplay, and while songs<br />\nsuch as \"Spirit of 76\" and<br />\n\"Deeside\" still had the quality of<br />\nanthems, it seemed clear that the<br />\nfolksy-guitar sound had been<br />\ntraded for a slicker, more poporiented sound.<br />\nWith their new album, Eye of<br />\nthe Hurricane, it is clear that the<br />\nangry young men who started out<br />\nhave mellowed a bit. Aside from<br />\nDave Sharp's \"One Step Closer<br />\nto Home,\" there is nothing that<br />\nresembles the earlier two albums,<br />\neither in terms of tone or musical<br />\nstyle. In a recent phone interview<br />\nwith guitarist and co-songwriter<br />\nEddie MacDonald, I asked him<br />\nabout some of the changes the<br />\nband seems to have gone through,<br />\nand here's what he said.<br />\nWhat I wanted to talk about today was the new album and some<br />\nofthe changes the hand has gone<br />\nthrough over the pastfew years.<br />\nIt seems that the angry young<br />\ncowpunks of The Stand and<br />\nDeclaration have mellowed out<br />\nand started writing love songs. Is<br />\nthis indicative ofsome changes in<br />\nthe band itself?<br />\nWell, I don't really recognize<br />\nlabels for the group. The group<br />\nhas gone through a period of five<br />\nor six years and our writing has<br />\nmatured into its present-day<br />\nform. That's about all I can say<br />\nfor that situation.<br />\nWell, when you first started out<br />\nin the band, what were some of<br />\n<br />\nthe things you had in mindfor it,<br />\nwhat were some of your goals?<br />\nBasically, I'm from a very<br />\nsmall town, a very working-class<br />\nbackground, and I enjoyed playing music. I fell in love with<br />\nmusic at a very early age, and I<br />\nwanted to get involved. I found<br />\nthat the punk movement was a<br />\nvery good way of getting started.<br />\nIt encouraged people who<br />\ncouldn't play to get in and learn<br />\nhow to play. We formed The<br />\nAlarm because we found<br />\nourselves in the situation in our<br />\nhometown where there were very<br />\nfew outlets. I had no qualifications, in school I really didn't fit<br />\ninto the educational system, and<br />\nmusic was my one way of selfexpression, really.<br />\nSince we've begun talking a little bit about the early punk movement, do youfeel that the changes<br />\nthat have occurred because of<br />\nthat have helped you in getting to<br />\nwhere you are now?<br />\nYes, definitely so.<br />\nSince that was the vehicle that<br />\ngot you all started, what do you<br />\nfeel you're doing now? How was<br />\nthe band changedfrom when you<br />\nstarted out with the punk<br />\nmovement?<br />\n(Long pause.) Like all<br />\nmovements.. . what it did was encourage me, basically, from the<br />\nword go. It managed, I would<br />\nsay, to move the group on. I find<br />\nit a difficult question to answer,<br />\nactually, it's a bit awkward.<br />\nMaybe you can express it another<br />\nway.<br />\nOkay, let's put it this way.<br />\nWhat's the band trying to accomplish now, what are your<br />\npresent-day goals?<br />\nTo bring music to people,<br />\nessentially. That's basically it, I<br />\ndon't want to sound too pompous.<br />\nPeople say we make music with<br />\na message, music with a conscience. I make music with a love.<br />\nI love music, and I always have.<br />\nThe marriage of the three would<br />\nbe the ideal sort of thing for The<br />\nAlarm, the ultimate median.<br />\nBut the message you started out<br />\nwith seems to have changed<br />\nsomewhat. Songs like \"Marching<br />\nOn seem radically differentfrom<br />\nthings like \"In the Presence of<br />\nLove. It seems that there is<br />\nmuch less of the fight and more<br />\nofan emphasis on relationships.<br />\nWell, I believe if you're going<br />\nto write a great song, you only<br />\nwrite it once, you don't try and<br />\nrepeat it. \"Marching On\" is still<br />\nas relevant today as when it was<br />\nwritten. I don't believe in blunting out a great song through<br />\nrepetition. \"Presence of Love\" is<br />\na song in its own right. It was<br />\nwritten with the basis of the group<br />\ngoing through a shift late last<br />\nyear, early this year. We basically had to close the door on the<br />\nmusic business after the Strength<br />\nalbum. There was an awful lot of<br />\npressure on the group to follow<br />\na pattern, to release another<br />\nalbum quickly and capitalize on<br />\neverything we'd achieved before,<br />\nand we were determined not to<br />\nfall into those sorts of traps, trying to make music just to be commercially successful. So we had-<br />\n<br />\nThe Alarm: Eddie MacDonald, Twist, Dave Sharp and Mike Peters.<br />\n<br />\nto make music in our own time,<br />\nin our own place, and in our own<br />\nmanner. So in a way, \"In the<br />\nPresence of Love\" is a song Mike<br />\nwrote when he managed to get<br />\naway from the business and lock<br />\nhimself away in hi home in<br />\nWales, and just write and write<br />\nwhat came naturally. When you<br />\ngrow up, you come through more<br />\nmature situations, and you have<br />\nto come to terms with those<br />\nmusically and lyrically. That's<br />\nthe way we express ourselves, so<br />\nthat's the style of songs on this<br />\nalbum.<br />\nI'd like to talk for a moment<br />\nabout the actual music itself It<br />\nseems that when you first started<br />\nout you all werejust a raw guitar<br />\nband, and with the last two<br />\nalbums, you've put a lot more emphasis on production. I was actually a little surprised to notice<br />\nthat on this album you were starting to use drum machines and<br />\nprogramming much more. Is<br />\nthere a particular reason why<br />\nyou've made this technological<br />\nshift?<br />\nIt was sort of a discovery of<br />\nrhythms, really. You start to<br />\nlisten to other sources of music<br />\nand styles, and our interpretation<br />\nof that was to fiddle with drum<br />\nmachies. I write on a drum<br />\nmachine at our house, and' have<br />\nfor some time. Twist especially<br />\nhas been getting into Latin<br />\nrhythms, African rhythms and<br />\nstuff, and basically, it was useful<br />\nto us in our own way. We came<br />\nup with this one rhythm on a<br />\nmachine that really suited the<br />\nsong \"Rain in the Summertime,\"<br />\nwhich is the only song done on a<br />\ndrum machine. It felt like it suited<br />\nthe mood of the song, it had a certain hypnotic nature to it which<br />\nencouraged the growth of the<br />\nmusic. We only had the melody<br />\nof the song, and Dave Sharp had<br />\nwritten the melody line for the<br />\nguitar. The marriage of the two<br />\n<br />\nseemed to work quite nicely, and<br />\nwe decided to keep it, so basically, it was Twist's idea.<br />\nI've also noticed over the years<br />\nthat you have had numerous producers. It seems that you've gone<br />\nthrough at leastfive or six before<br />\nyou finally settled on John Porter<br />\nto produced this album. Is there<br />\na particular sound you've been<br />\nlookingfor, and have you finally<br />\nfound it?<br />\nWe always strive for new goals<br />\nand new things. Yes, we've<br />\nfound the right producer for the<br />\nright record, and whether we'll<br />\nuse the same producer for the<br />\nnext record, I don't know because<br />\nit depends on what shape the next<br />\nalbum takes. We're already sort<br />\nof working on the new album,<br />\nwe're already playing some new<br />\nsongs in our show at this moment.<br />\nBasically, we're just working<br />\nvery hard towards the future,<br />\nalways looking forward. We're a<br />\nvery forward-looking group,<br />\nand we'll continue to do so. John,<br />\nas I said, was the perfect man for<br />\nthis album. We co-produced it<br />\nwith John ourselves, so we obviously got more involved in the<br />\nproduction, and I think that's a<br />\nvery healthy thing for an artist,<br />\nbecause I think an artist should be<br />\nin charge of his own creative output instead of allowing someone<br />\nelse to put their identity on it.<br />\nI read in an article that was<br />\npart ofyour press kit where Mike<br />\nPeters made the statement that<br />\nyou'd gone too hardfor numbers<br />\nwith Strength, and that this was<br />\nmore ofan album that you made<br />\nfor yourselves. In what way do<br />\nyou feel this album was more of<br />\nsomething for yourselves?<br />\nWell, I have to say something:<br />\nI have made all of our albums for<br />\nmyself. I enjoy making music,<br />\nand I find albums very difficult to<br />\nmake, because it's an emotional<br />\nthing and so much effort goes into making them. But with this<br />\n<br />\nalbum, I was able to relax quite<br />\na bit more and just basically enjoy it. I can talk for myself on that<br />\none.<br />\nIt's interesting that even though<br />\nthere seems to have been some<br />\ndissatisfaction with Strength, you<br />\nchose to build upon the style of<br />\nthat album instead ofreturning to<br />\nyour earlier style.<br />\nWell, I don't write to a formula. The Alarm don't have a<br />\nformula for success. We've made<br />\nsongs and treated each song with<br />\nthe respect that it deserves, and<br />\nthat's all I can really say on that<br />\none. Because when you write a<br />\nsong, you have a certain feel in<br />\nmind. I rather go by the feel of<br />\nthe song rather than what the style<br />\nof the current climate of production is, or the climate of what we<br />\ndid on the last album. We have<br />\nour own musical style, our own<br />\nway we approach things. But<br />\nbasically, we just go by what suits<br />\nthe song. The song is the cornerstone of everything. really.<br />\nIs there anything you'd like to<br />\nchange about this album or whish<br />\nyou had done differently?<br />\nI just wish we could've recorded it even faster. We recorded it<br />\nin six weeks and mixed it in six<br />\nweeks. I just wish that nowadays<br />\nalbums could be made in about<br />\ntwo weeks. It's a shame really,<br />\nbut that's life. No, I wouldn't actually change anything, no.<br />\nDo you think one ofthe reasons<br />\nit took so long to get this out was<br />\nbecause you were putting so much<br />\nmore production value into it?<br />\nSix weeks? (laughs) I think that<br />\nanswers that question.<br />\nOne final thing, just out of<br />\ncuriosity. As I was looking at the<br />\nalbum cover this morning, I noticed that you seem to be giving<br />\nDave Sharp a rather stern look.<br />\nWhat's the situation here?<br />\n(Laughing) He's just a better<br />\nlooking guy than I am.<br />\n<br />\n\f14/DECEMBER 11, 1987<br />\n<br />\nManiacs: Bop 'till you drop at Shriver Hall<br />\nby Jeffrey M. Per!stein<br />\nMonday night at Shriver Hall,<br />\nthe 10,000 Maniacs brought their<br />\nunique blend of countryprogressive-\"rock-a-billy\"dance music to town and sent the<br />\njoint jumping. Headlining a triple<br />\nbill which also included Miracle<br />\nLegion and Karen Goldberg, this<br />\nband that previously opened for<br />\nR.E.M. thrilled the audience with<br />\nan engaging concert performance. The tremendously gifted<br />\nvocalist and her very tight backing band provided an energetic<br />\nevening of danceable tunes for all<br />\nwho attended.<br />\nFollowing a quick comment<br />\nabout Kerouac and Cassidy, the<br />\ndownbeat by the drummer sent<br />\nThe Maniacs rocking through<br />\ntheir first two songs. The<br />\nunderstated dress of the vocalist<br />\nparalleled the modest rhythms of<br />\nthe early numbers. Garbed in a<br />\nsimple, black outfit, white stockings, and a black shawl, physically she projected a very plain and<br />\ngirlish image. However, one<br />\nrecognized from the outset that<br />\nshe was completely in control of<br />\nthe band, the music, and the<br />\naudience.<br />\nAs she belted out the first<br />\nseveral melodies, the sheer power<br />\nof her voice was evident. Sitting<br />\non the edge of the stage and<br />\ndelivering a tune with definite<br />\ncountry influences, she commanded the audience's attention.<br />\nThe crowd wilingly responded<br />\nand she remarked that they were<br />\n\"very quiet and courteous.\"<br />\nAs if intending to shake them<br />\nfrom this passively polite state,<br />\nthe next song was a haunting<br />\nnumber with a furious drum beat.<br />\nThe visual effect of ghoulish<br />\nshadows dancing upon the wall<br />\ncombined with a bizarre guitar effect resembling whale calls<br />\nhelped to enhance the unsettling<br />\nnature of the piece.<br />\nThe performance then changed<br />\ndirection, exploring a more<br />\ndanceable avenue. Introduced as<br />\n<br />\n\"a song that Jerry (the drummer)<br />\nwrote,\" the latin feel of the next<br />\ntune brought many fans to their<br />\nfeet. The choreography of the<br />\nvocalist was very appropriate,<br />\nmimicking a cha-cha or rhumba,<br />\nand effectively coaxed many<br />\nmembers of the audience to do the<br />\nsame. Along the sides and back<br />\nof the theatre, people gyrated to<br />\nthe \"South of the Border,\" accompaniment lent to the piece by<br />\nthe keyboardist. By the second<br />\nsong following the drumer's composition, about sixty fans had boldly approached the front of the<br />\nstage and were bopping to the<br />\nbeat. Their energy and daring encouraged others to dance up<br />\nfront: about one hundred all told.<br />\nThe rest of the audience responded likewise, clapping along with<br />\nthe driving beat and rising, remaining standing until the concert's end.<br />\nThe pace of the performance<br />\nquickened to an intentional<br />\ncrescendo, building to a fever<br />\npitch of cheering and dancing.<br />\nThe 10,000 Maniacs left the stage<br />\njust as the energy had climaxed:<br />\nan intelligently orchestrated performance strategy. The audience,<br />\nrefusing to be denied, cheered on<br />\ntheir feet until the band's return.<br />\nThe first encore continued the<br />\n\"dance-a-billy\" energy, yet experimented with variations on this<br />\ntheme.

However, following an<br />\nunassuming vocal entrance in<br />\nwhich she stood transfixed, the<br />\nlead singer led The Maniacs<br />\nthrough a truly dance-rhythm<br />\nchorus.

Listening<br />\nto this album, it becomes quickly apparent that The Alarm have<br />\nmatured over the years, both<br />\nmusically and personally, while<br />\nstill managing to maintain a<br />\ndegree of their former folk-rock<br />\nstyle. They are, quite apparently,<br />\nno longer a guitar band, which is<br />\na shame (take a lesson from The<br />\nSmiths, guys\u2014you can still be<br />\nvirtually all guitar and acoustic<br />\nand be equally expressive), but<br />\n<br />\nthe synths work, to a degree.

The<br />\nJays had lost each of their opening games by less than three<br />\npoints, and were plagued by<br />\ndefensive breakdowns.

But in the second half, the home court advantage began to work in favor of St.<br />\nMary's, as they responded to the<br />\nnoise from the crowd and began<br />\nto play with much more intens--<br />\n<br />\ninto the paint much too easily,<br />\nand as a result they are committing a lot of fouls.

According to Armstrong,<br />\nhowever, one sentence in the current tenure regulations has recently come under the Academic<br />\nCouncil's scrutiny.<br />\nThe sentence reads, \"The<br />\nAcademic Council may recommend tenure to an associate professor in exceptional circumstances, where it is in the<br />\ncompelling interest of the University to do so . . . .\"<br />\nAccording to Armstrong, the<br />\nsentence is \"ill-defined\" and, as<br />\na result, has become effectively<br />\n\"inoperative.\" One current concern of the Academic Council,<br /><br />\nCouncil seeks more<br />\nactivities for students<br />\nby Jon Stempel<br />\nStudent Council President Scott<br />\nFitzGerald exhorted the Council<br />\nto look ahead to next semester<br />\nand proposed several ideas for<br />\nimproving the quality of life at<br />\nHopkins for the Council to consider next semester.<br />\nFitzGerald listed several of the<br />\nmajor activities that Council initiated this semester, including<br />\nFall Fest, Hoppy Hour, and P.T.<br />\nFlaggs night, and reminded the<br />\nCouncil of some of the major<br />\nacademic issues tackled during<br />\nthe semester, notably the proposed revisions in add-drop<br />\ndeadlines.<br />\n\"I think we did a really good<br />\njob, \" he said. \"We got a lot<br />\ndone, but we should look forward<br />\nto next semester.\"<br />\nOn the activities side, FitzGerald proposed that the Council sponsor \"at least two quad<br />\nparties, like Fall Fest, when it's<br />\nwarm,\" and at least one more<br />\nP.T.

First, contended<br />\nNorton, El Salvador's president was nervous<br />\nabout the potential for the Democrats to con(trol U.S. foreign policy in the near future. In<br />\nresponse, Duarte accepted the peace plan in<br />\nan attempt to establish conncections with the<br />\nDemocrats and to distance himself from the<br />\nReagan Administration.<br />\nSecond, Norton expressed the possibility<br />\nthat \"Duarte saw the plan as a way of framing himself as a peacemaker again,\" because<br />\n\"analysis of the plan shows that little is required of the Salvadorans.\"<br />\nThe peace plan calls upon El Salvador to<br />\ntake steps to achieve a cease fire in El<br />\nSalvador and to grant amnesty to political<br />\nprisoners.

Traditionally,<br />\nthe policy holds that tenure will<br />\nnot be given until full professorship has been attained.<br />\nMuller suggested that, as<br />\nrecently as twenty years ago,<br />\ntenure was not much of an issue<br />\nbecause at that time, a greater<br />\npercentage of scholars were being promoted to full professorships. \"Now,\" he said, \"people honestly don't know whether<br />\nthey will get tenure after associate<br />\nprofessorship.<br />\n\"A couple of years ago, we<br />\nwere looking at people getting attractive offers of associate professorships with tenure from<br />\nother places, \" said Muller.<br />\n\"[We have a feeling that] we are<br />\nlosing and not attracting people<br />\nbecause we cannot give them<br />\ntenure as associate professors.\"<br />\nMuller said that a subcommittee was formed at that time to examine tenure policy at Hopkins.<br />\nIt modified tenure regulations by<br />\npermitting tenure to be given at<br />\nthe associate professor level in<br />\nexceptional cases.<br />\nMuller said that the changes<br />\nmade two years ago did not address the issue properly. \"I think<br />\nthere is a continuing disposition<br />\nthat there should be some changes<br />\nin the [tenure] procedure,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"[but] if you were to ask me<br />\nwhere this will all come out, I<br />\nhonestly don't know.\"<br />\nThe discussion of tenure continued with the issue of mandatory retirement for faculty<br />\nmembers. As of last year, the<br />\nfederal law regarding mandatory<br />\nretirement at age seventy was<br />\nchanged; under the new law,<br /><br />\nmandatory retirement can no<br />\nlonger be based on age. Universities unsuccessfully attempted to<br />\nbe exempted from the law;<br />\nhowever, they were given a year<br />\ngrace period.<br />\nMuller said that the issue is<br />\nwhether Hopkins should use the<br />\nexemption. He raised four problems with professors not retiring at age seventy.<br />\nThe first point was one of expense. \"It is not so much a question of paying people,\"he said,<br />\nbut rather the University's continued contribution to employee<br />\nbenefits for retirement years. The<br />\nUniversity contributes more<br />\nmoney for a retirement period<br />\nnecessarily shortened by continued employment.<br />\nMuller raised in his second<br />\npoint whether professors who<br />\nwork past age seventy should<br />\ncontinue to keep offices and<br />\nlaboratory space, which would<br />\nsuggest conflict with newer<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nFurthermore, said Muller,<br />\n\"tenure used to be a commitment<br />\nuntil retirement. Now, it's virtually a lifetime commitment.\"<br />\nFinally, Muller suggested that<br />\nthe issue of tenure could take on<br />\nnew meaning because it guarantees employment for a long<br />\nperiod of time. \"Tenure has<br />\nnever been an absolute right,<br />\nhe said. He spoke of the possibility of creating an evaluation<br />\nsystem because \"you're going to<br />\nmake a lifetime commitment to<br />\npeople and can't dismiss them on<br />\naccount of age,\"he said. Muller<br />\nmentioned that another option<br />\nmight be to hire professors on a<br />\ncontract basis.<br />\nHe noted that this policy may<br />\nnot pose a big problem. \"It's an<br />\nerroneous assumption to believe<br />\nthat faculty members will want to<br />\nstay here forever,\" he said.<br />\nIn the interview, Muller also<br />\ndiscussed the progress of the<br />\n$450 million Campaign for Johns<br />\nHopkins. Last month, the campaign reached the $380 million<br />\nmark. Muller expected the campaign to reach its goal by<br /><br />\nOPKINSSPRINGBREAKFLINGS<br />\nWith The Travel Connection<br />\n'Your connection To'The World<br /><br />\n467-9300<br />\nConveniently Located In The Rotunda Mall<br />\nUp The Ramp From Giant, Via Hopkins Shuttle<br />\nOr Just Call Our University Travel Specialists Today !!!!<br /><br />\nARUBA CONNECTION<br />\n7 NIGHTS (March 20-27)<br /><br />\nBARBADOS CONNECTION<br /><br />\ntr.$69?<br />\np.p.db<br />\n13-13.cibl\u2022<br />\nfrom<br /><br />\nCANCUN CONNECTION<br /><br />\nfrom<br /><br />\n7 NIGHTS (MARCH 20-27)<br /><br />\nCAYMAN IS.

It reflects the university's commitment to its immeasurably valuable recourse: the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nThe Academic Council of the Homewood Schools<br />\nat present is attempting to redefine policy towards<br />\ngranting tenure to associate professors. Two years<br />\nago, the Council changed policy from not giving<br />\nassociate professors tenure to giving it in \"...exceptional circumstances where it is in the compelling interest of the University to do so...\" The Council feels this policy is too vaguely worded to adequately guide them in tenure decisions.<br />\nThe disposition to change policy two years ago<br />\nwas motivated by a perception that associate professors were being lured to other institutions which<br />\nwere offering associate professorships with tenure.<br />\nRecognizing certain problems with regualarly offering tenure to associate professors, they struck<br />\nupon the \"exceptional circumstance\" compromise.<br />\nThe new policy, as Muller described \"has caused more problems than it has solved.\" Proposals<br />\nto rectify the situation include granting tenure to<br />\nassociate professors as a separate process from promotion to the rank of associate professor, and<br />\nregualarly granting associate profesoors tenure except in some circumstances.<br />\nThe issue, as complicated as it is, is made even<br /><br />\nmore so because federal law mandating retirement<br />\nat age 70 as been struck down. Universities, though<br />\ntrying to gain permanent exemption from the law,<br />\nwere granted a seven year exemption only. This<br />\nmeans as of 1994, professors can not be made to<br />\nretire on account of age.<br />\nThe commitments to university-tenured faculty,<br />\nby means of employee retirement benefits, office<br />\nspace etc., are significant. For good or bad, mandatory retirement ensured a certain rate of turnover<br />\nof professors. Hopkins is concerned that the lifting<br />\nof the law, by extending the high end of faculty age,<br />\nand tenuring associate professors, by extending the<br />\nlow end of faculty age, will pinch the institution<br />\nfinancially and physically. All of this is beside its<br />\nconcern about reducing the standard of professors.<br />\nTo respond to the implicit danger of life-long<br />\ntenure, the University is considering periodic non<br />\nage-related evaluation of faculty, or hiring by contracts. Both of these are novel and worriesome<br />\nsolutions.<br />\nFinding the best solution to these problems will<br />\nnot be easy. The Academic Council is well-advised,<br />\nhowever, to carefully consider what standards are<br />\nused for the granting of tenure. Furthermore, it cannot relax its commitment to tenured faculty and must<br />\nreassert this commitment while the tenuous issue<br />\nof their future is being discussed.<br /><br />\nWWWWITITTIVV1717<br /><br />\nA Semester's Tidings<br />\nIt was not a thrilling semester for the Hopkins<br />\nnewspaper business. It lacked firebombings or shanty arrests, university bond issues, fraternity newsletters, or even WJHU power boosts.<br />\nIn fact, the biggest story of the semester was not<br />\neven a story in itself. The report of the Human<br />\nClimate Task Force Committee, while a substancial document, is really only important as it can<br />\nserve as a catalyst for reform and change.<br />\nHomewood, however, is by no means at a standstill. The construction continues, the money comes<br />\nin through the Campaign, plans are moving for student housing renovations and athletic center additions and a self-evaluation by the Arts and Sciences<br />\nand Engineering academic departments is (over)due<br />\nto begin.<br />\nAll of this is exciting. But frustration tinges this<br />\nexcitement. These projects and others will take<br />\ntime\u2014time short in the University's history perhaps,<br /><br />\nbut long in terms of an undergraduate career. To<br />\nbe concerned at all requires looking beyond one's<br />\nown career. Concern manifests the affection one has<br />\nfor the alma mater, and maybe a little well-wishing<br />\nfor future undergraduates.<br />\nSo undergraduates hope, with guarded optimism,<br />\nthat the results of today's efforts pay off. Maybe<br />\nthis sort of thing has been around as long as there<br />\nhave been institutions with a future to look foward<br />\nto. Something feels different about Homewood now,<br />\nhowever. It feels like the plans are more numerous<br />\nthan a couple of years ago. It also feels like there<br />\nis a new enhanced receptivity to undergraduate concerns.

It was no surprise, then, when he spoke to the<br />\nCollege Republicans on Monday,<br />\nDecember 7, on that subject. Dr.<br />\nHanke's credentials and expertise<br />\non the subject speak for<br />\nthemselves. He served as Senior<br />\nEconomist on the President's<br />\nCouncil for Economic Advisers<br />\nfrom 1981-82. He has worked<br />\nclosely with David Stockman on<br />\na number of privatization projects<br />\nranging from public water works<br />\nto western grazing lands.<br />\nWashington Post columnist Jack<br />\nAnderson calls Hanke \"the key<br />\nproponent of privatizing.\" Hanke<br />\nis regarded as one of the nation's<br />\nof<br />\nscholars<br />\nforemost<br />\nprivatization.<br />\nMany people are unfamiliar<br />\nwith the notion of privatization.<br />\nHanke explains in the introduction to Prospectsfor Privatization<br />\nthat it is simply \"the transfer of<br />\nassets or service functions from<br />\npublic to private ownership or<br />\ncontrol.\" There are several<br />\nreasons that privatization is<br />\ndesperately called for in contemporary American politics.<br />\nUndoubtedly the most important one is the mandate for the<br />\nlocus of ownership to be in the<br />\nprivate, not the public, sphere.<br />\nHanke agreed with this issue as<br />\nthe priority of privatization by<br />\nstating, \"One thing that<br />\ndistinguishes communism from<br />\ncapitalism, according to Engels<br />\nand Marx, is 'the abolition of<br />\nprivate property.' In order to<br />\npreserve the individual liberties of<br />\nevery American's fundamental<br />\nright to property, it is necessary<br /><br />\nto place as many things as possible in the private domain.\"<br />\nA second reason for privatization concerns the fact that public<br />\nlands generate large negative cash<br />\nflows. Privatizing them will<br />\neliminate these annual losses that<br />\ntaxpayers must currently fund.<br />\nPrivatizing these lands also<br />\neliminates the capital carrying<br />\ncosts associated with these lands.<br />\nA third reason supporting<br />\nprivatization is the increase in<br />\nproductivity that will follow from<br />\na transfer of lands into the private<br />\nsector. Of the twelve states in the<br />\nwestern United States, all of them<br />\ncontain some public lands. This<br />\nland\u2014a total of 686 million<br />\nacres\u2014is completely socialized.<br />\nWere these lands sovereign, they<br />\nwould comprise the third largest<br />\nsocialist nation in the world,<br />\nbehind the U.S.S.R. and China.<br />\nBy privatizing these lands and<br />\ndesocializing them, their productivity will naturally increase. Recent studies by Hanke have<br />\nshown in one case that privatizing western timber lands would<br />\nimprove their productivity twelve<br />\nand a half times.<br />\nPrivatizing these timber lands<br />\nwould allow the trees to be cut<br />\nwhen they mature instead of forcing a conformity to government<br />\ncutting rates. These low government cutting rates cause overmaturity in timber lands, leading<br />\nto environmental decay and the<br />\nincrease in likelihood of forest<br />\nfires.<br />\nA fourth reason for privatization is that it enhances the environmental and wildlife value of<br />\nthe area.

Lee Davis \"<br />\nThe screaming grew louder,<br />\nmore confusing. Was a woman<br />\nbeing assaulted or having a good<br />\ntime Should I get up or should<br />\nI keep sleeping? In a four a.m.<br />\nfog, my brain didn't have any<br />\nready answers. The shriek came<br />\nagain. I jumped up and ran to the<br />\nwindow. Cold air streamed into<br />\nthe room as I stuck my head out<br />\ninto the night.<br />\nI could see her across the<br />\nstreet, on the corner of 33rd and<br />\nSt. Paul. An indistinct, dark<br />\nshape was chasing her. With<br />\nanother shriek she turned to push<br />\nit away. I quickly pulled on some<br />\npants. I decided to take one more<br />\nlook before I called security, and<br />\nI was glad I did, because when I<br />\nagain invited the winter in<br />\nthrough my window, she was in<br />\nanother girl's arms, and they<br />\nwere falling over each other<br />\nlaughing. Needless to say, I was<br />\nnot.<br />\nLike spiders, screams in the<br />\nnight bother. Like spiders, the<br />\nmajority of them are innocuous,<br />\nbut, like spiders, a rare few are<br />\ndeadly. This year, our campus<br />\nand its citizens haven't experienced the drawn-gun muggings and<br />\nother assaults that we have seen<br />\nin the past, but it would be a<br />\nmistake to attribute this to increased security or augmented<br />\nstudent awareness of the city's<br />\ndangers. I can't help but think<br />\nplain luck has played the major<br />\nrole, and the problem with luck<br />\nis that sooner or later it runs out.<br />\nThere is a danger involved in<br />\nunneeded screaming. Remember<br /><br />\nthe story of the boy who was a<br />\nshepard of the town's flock? To<br />\nhave a little fun, he shouted from<br />\nthe hilltops \"Wolf! Wolf!\" and<br />\nsent the townsfolk scurrying up to<br />\nthe fields. They admonished him,<br />\nbut soon after this rebuke he<br />\nagain cried \"Wolf!\" with the<br />\nsame result. When the wolf finally arrived, no one believed the<br />\nboy's cries, and many of those<br />\nsheep felt the beast's bite. I don't<br />\nrecall if the boy was eaten as<br />\nwell, but if he wasn't, he should<br />\nhave been.<br />\nAlice, who is a happy-go-lucky<br />\ntype and often screams because<br />\nshe is drunk or rambunctious,<br />\nmay never walk alone and stay in<br />\nwell-lighted areas. Her shouts<br />\nhowever, may create a skeptical<br />\nenvironment, so that when Ann<br />\n(Alice's alter-ego who leaves the<br />\nlibrary after a night of quiet studying and decides to walk home<br />\nthis one time because the shuttle<br />\nis running late) finds herself confronted by an assaulter, people<br />\nlike myself, hearing her scream,<br />\nwill just say \"Oh, that's Alice<br />\nagain.\"<br />\nIt's not just Ann that's put in<br />\ndanger. Last year, while leaving<br />\nthe hallowed halls of the<br />\nGatehouse at about 4:30 a.m., I<br />\nwas actually chased by two<br />\ngentlemen from Wyman Park<br />\nwith more than a little quick cash<br />\non their minds. If my feet weren't<br />\nquite so fleet(and believe me they<br />\nwere that night) and I had been<br />\nforced to yell for help, I would<br />\nhope that someone would have<br />\nresponded with something more<br /><br />\nSee LEE, 8<br /><br />\nWith Eyes Closei\u00b0 ly<br /><br />\nAMES\" c.<br /><br />\n\"I14A60.16 A<br />\nAWE&amp; 'ME sleek *LUNE or<br />\n?NE No\"' IA) TNE- MONTH OF PEeENtit.R CAA/<br />\nREDUcE You le A gurwee/M 1-pien\u201e<br /><br />\nIJAWIP You my SarY 7No(440 Lbuoli's To SPEND<br />\nCoe t0iEN<br />\ne,47E-A,<br />\nCAwAT<br />\nEmfERAVG A RAGE<br />\nMis eAtleiP.

Woa<br />\nwas the night I tried to go to sleep<br />\nwhen there was a Chem test the<br />\nnext month. He has always admonished me to the fact that I, being a Humanities major, would be<br />\nworking the Whopper board until the Burger King mandatory<br />\nretirement age of sixty-five, while<br />\nhe would be raking in ten thou per<br />\nheart operation. I never did, and<br />\nstill do not, agree that his choice<br />\nof goals is better than mine. For<br />\nwhile I now have the opportunity to do whatever I want in the<br />\nworld, he is locked up for years<br />\nin med school, etc., etc. He may<br />\nbe making $500,000 when he is<br />\nthirty, and I might be a struggling reporter for the Des Moines<br />\nTractor Daily, but I think I will<br />\nhave had the edge. For he might<br />\nwake up at age thirty and say,<br />\n\"My God, what have I missed?\"<br />\nOne thing I have learned being<br />\nin this intensely pre-professional<br />\nenvironment is that the ceaseless<br />\npursuit of success can only be<br />\nharmful to a person in the long<br />\nrun. Life is, of course, for living.<br />\nI can only suggest that those of us<br />\nwho feel an intense desire to zip<br />\noff to business school right after<br />\ngraduation, and then on to a nice<br />\npaying desk job with E.F. Hutton, should stop and re-evaluate<br />\ntheir priorities. This is (discounting Budhist or Hari Krishna<br />\nbeliefs) the only life you get. If<br />\nyou don't experience all that you<br />\ncan now, you never will again.<br />\nThere is a professor of mine<br />\nwho, although this is the first<br />\nsemester I have had a class with<br />\nhim, I have gotten to know fairly<br /><br />\nwell since being on a school trip<br />\nwith him two years ago. As he<br />\nsits, at age thirty, and watches an<br />\nendless succesion of his grad<br />\nschool friends settle down into<br />\npermanent jobs and get married,<br />\nI can sense a bit of uncomfortable<br />\nfeelings in him. Every time<br />\nanother friend gets married, he<br />\n- seems to feel the need to rationalize his independence and his<br />\nposition in life by saying \"My life<br />\nis different from these guys.\"<br />\nPerhaps he feels uncomfortable<br />\nwith the fact that his life is not an<br />\nordinary one. But I ask the question, \"What is a 'normal' life??\"<br />\nIs it right to settle down and get<br />\na good career-oriented job at age<br />\ntwenty-two just because everyone<br />\nelse is, and that is what is expected of you? The moral of the<br />\nstory is that I feel everyone must<br />\ndecide what his or her priorities<br />\nare in life, while remembering<br />\nthat you only go through once.<br />\nAnyway, I have rambled on<br />\nabout nothing long enough.

But what is also apparent<br />\nis that many of these groups have<br />\nhad to undergo many changes<br />\nfrom their punk beginnings in<br />\norder to gain present-day<br />\npopularity.<br />\nOne such group is The Alarm.<br />\nStarting off around 1977, The<br />\nAlarm came in on the very beginnings of the Punk movement, and<br />\nincorporated the fierce guitar<br />\nferocity of the times with a rootsy,, acoustic-guitar/harmonica<br />\nstyle of music (later to be called<br />\ncowpunk) that was vaguely<br />\nreminiscent of such folk artists as<br />\nBob Dylan. Also like Dylan,<br />\nthese were four guys with<br />\nsomething to say. While most<br />\npunk bands of the time were content to say that the world sucked,<br />\na statement that pop-critic Lester<br />\nBangs described as being<br />\n\"somewhat, ah, insufficient,\"<br />\nThe Alarm were busy making the<br />\nstatement that the world sucked,<br />\nbut if you stood up for and believed in yourself, and if we all hung<br />\ntogether, things mightn't<br />\nnecessarily get better, but life<br />\nsure would be a lot more<br />\ntolerable. Such was the message<br />\nof their first two albums, The<br />\nStand (an EP) and Declaration.<br />\nWith their third album,<br />\nStrength, it was clear from the<br />\nopening synthesizer sequencing<br />\n_ of the first track, \"Knife Edge,\"<br />\nthat some changes were in the air.<br />\nAll four tracks of the first side<br />\nsmacked of an attempt at AOR<br />\nradio airplay, and while songs<br />\nsuch as \"Spirit of 76\" and<br />\n\"Deeside\" still had the quality of<br />\nanthems, it seemed clear that the<br />\nfolksy-guitar sound had been<br />\ntraded for a slicker, more poporiented sound.<br />\nWith their new album, Eye of<br />\nthe Hurricane, it is clear that the<br />\nangry young men who started out<br />\nhave mellowed a bit. Aside from<br />\nDave Sharp's \"One Step Closer<br />\nto Home,\" there is nothing that<br />\nresembles the earlier two albums,<br />\neither in terms of tone or musical<br />\nstyle. In a recent phone interview<br />\nwith guitarist and co-songwriter<br />\nEddie MacDonald, I asked him<br />\nabout some of the changes the<br />\nband seems to have gone through,<br />\nand here's what he said.<br />\nWhat I wanted to talk about today was the new album and some<br />\nofthe changes the hand has gone<br />\nthrough over the pastfew years.<br />\nIt seems that the angry young<br />\ncowpunks of The Stand and<br />\nDeclaration have mellowed out<br />\nand started writing love songs. Is<br />\nthis indicative ofsome changes in<br />\nthe band itself?<br />\nWell, I don't really recognize<br />\nlabels for the group. The group<br />\nhas gone through a period of five<br />\nor six years and our writing has<br />\nmatured into its present-day<br />\nform. That's about all I can say<br />\nfor that situation.<br />\nWell, when you first started out<br />\nin the band, what were some of<br /><br />\nthe things you had in mindfor it,<br />\nwhat were some of your goals?<br />\nBasically, I'm from a very<br />\nsmall town, a very working-class<br />\nbackground, and I enjoyed playing music. I fell in love with<br />\nmusic at a very early age, and I<br />\nwanted to get involved. I found<br />\nthat the punk movement was a<br />\nvery good way of getting started.<br />\nIt encouraged people who<br />\ncouldn't play to get in and learn<br />\nhow to play. We formed The<br />\nAlarm because we found<br />\nourselves in the situation in our<br />\nhometown where there were very<br />\nfew outlets. I had no qualifications, in school I really didn't fit<br />\ninto the educational system, and<br />\nmusic was my one way of selfexpression, really.<br />\nSince we've begun talking a little bit about the early punk movement, do youfeel that the changes<br />\nthat have occurred because of<br />\nthat have helped you in getting to<br />\nwhere you are now?<br />\nYes, definitely so.<br />\nSince that was the vehicle that<br />\ngot you all started, what do you<br />\nfeel you're doing now? How was<br />\nthe band changedfrom when you<br />\nstarted out with the punk<br />\nmovement?<br />\n(Long pause.) Like all<br />\nmovements.. . what it did was encourage me, basically, from the<br />\nword go. It managed, I would<br />\nsay, to move the group on. I find<br />\nit a difficult question to answer,<br />\nactually, it's a bit awkward.<br />\nMaybe you can express it another<br />\nway.<br />\nOkay, let's put it this way.<br />\nWhat's the band trying to accomplish now, what are your<br />\npresent-day goals?<br />\nTo bring music to people,<br />\nessentially. That's basically it, I<br />\ndon't want to sound too pompous.<br />\nPeople say we make music with<br />\na message, music with a conscience. I make music with a love.<br />\nI love music, and I always have.<br />\nThe marriage of the three would<br />\nbe the ideal sort of thing for The<br />\nAlarm, the ultimate median.<br />\nBut the message you started out<br />\nwith seems to have changed<br />\nsomewhat. Songs like \"Marching<br />\nOn seem radically differentfrom<br />\nthings like \"In the Presence of<br />\nLove. It seems that there is<br />\nmuch less of the fight and more<br />\nofan emphasis on relationships.<br />\nWell, I believe if you're going<br />\nto write a great song, you only<br />\nwrite it once, you don't try and<br />\nrepeat it. \"Marching On\" is still<br />\nas relevant today as when it was<br />\nwritten. I don't believe in blunting out a great song through<br />\nrepetition. \"Presence of Love\" is<br />\na song in its own right. It was<br />\nwritten with the basis of the group<br />\ngoing through a shift late last<br />\nyear, early this year. We basically had to close the door on the<br />\nmusic business after the Strength<br />\nalbum. There was an awful lot of<br />\npressure on the group to follow<br />\na pattern, to release another<br />\nalbum quickly and capitalize on<br />\neverything we'd achieved before,<br />\nand we were determined not to<br />\nfall into those sorts of traps, trying to make music just to be commercially successful. So we had-<br /><br />\nThe Alarm: Eddie MacDonald, Twist, Dave Sharp and Mike Peters.<br /><br />\nto make music in our own time,<br />\nin our own place, and in our own<br />\nmanner. So in a way, \"In the<br />\nPresence of Love\" is a song Mike<br />\nwrote when he managed to get<br />\naway from the business and lock<br />\nhimself away in hi home in<br />\nWales, and just write and write<br />\nwhat came naturally. When you<br />\ngrow up, you come through more<br />\nmature situations, and you have<br />\nto come to terms with those<br />\nmusically and lyrically. That's<br />\nthe way we express ourselves, so<br />\nthat's the style of songs on this<br />\nalbum.<br />\nI'd like to talk for a moment<br />\nabout the actual music itself It<br />\nseems that when you first started<br />\nout you all werejust a raw guitar<br />\nband, and with the last two<br />\nalbums, you've put a lot more emphasis on production. I was actually a little surprised to notice<br />\nthat on this album you were starting to use drum machines and<br />\nprogramming much more. Is<br />\nthere a particular reason why<br />\nyou've made this technological<br />\nshift?<br />\nIt was sort of a discovery of<br />\nrhythms, really. You start to<br />\nlisten to other sources of music<br />\nand styles, and our interpretation<br />\nof that was to fiddle with drum<br />\nmachies. I write on a drum<br />\nmachine at our house, and' have<br />\nfor some time. Twist especially<br />\nhas been getting into Latin<br />\nrhythms, African rhythms and<br />\nstuff, and basically, it was useful<br />\nto us in our own way. We came<br />\nup with this one rhythm on a<br />\nmachine that really suited the<br />\nsong \"Rain in the Summertime,\"<br />\nwhich is the only song done on a<br />\ndrum machine. It felt like it suited<br />\nthe mood of the song, it had a certain hypnotic nature to it which<br />\nencouraged the growth of the<br />\nmusic. We only had the melody<br />\nof the song, and Dave Sharp had<br />\nwritten the melody line for the<br />\nguitar. The marriage of the two<br /><br />\nseemed to work quite nicely, and<br />\nwe decided to keep it, so basically, it was Twist's idea.<br />\nI've also noticed over the years<br />\nthat you have had numerous producers. It seems that you've gone<br />\nthrough at leastfive or six before<br />\nyou finally settled on John Porter<br />\nto produced this album. Is there<br />\na particular sound you've been<br />\nlookingfor, and have you finally<br />\nfound it?<br />\nWe always strive for new goals<br />\nand new things. Yes, we've<br />\nfound the right producer for the<br />\nright record, and whether we'll<br />\nuse the same producer for the<br />\nnext record, I don't know because<br />\nit depends on what shape the next<br />\nalbum takes. We're already sort<br />\nof working on the new album,<br />\nwe're already playing some new<br />\nsongs in our show at this moment.<br />\nBasically, we're just working<br />\nvery hard towards the future,<br />\nalways looking forward. We're a<br />\nvery forward-looking group,<br />\nand we'll continue to do so. John,<br />\nas I said, was the perfect man for<br />\nthis album. We co-produced it<br />\nwith John ourselves, so we obviously got more involved in the<br />\nproduction, and I think that's a<br />\nvery healthy thing for an artist,<br />\nbecause I think an artist should be<br />\nin charge of his own creative output instead of allowing someone<br />\nelse to put their identity on it.<br />\nI read in an article that was<br />\npart ofyour press kit where Mike<br />\nPeters made the statement that<br />\nyou'd gone too hardfor numbers<br />\nwith Strength, and that this was<br />\nmore ofan album that you made<br />\nfor yourselves. In what way do<br />\nyou feel this album was more of<br />\nsomething for yourselves?<br />\nWell, I have to say something:<br />\nI have made all of our albums for<br />\nmyself. I enjoy making music,<br />\nand I find albums very difficult to<br />\nmake, because it's an emotional<br />\nthing and so much effort goes into making them. But with this<br /><br />\nalbum, I was able to relax quite<br />\na bit more and just basically enjoy it. I can talk for myself on that<br />\none.<br />\nIt's interesting that even though<br />\nthere seems to have been some<br />\ndissatisfaction with Strength, you<br />\nchose to build upon the style of<br />\nthat album instead ofreturning to<br />\nyour earlier style.<br />\nWell, I don't write to a formula. The Alarm don't have a<br />\nformula for success. We've made<br />\nsongs and treated each song with<br />\nthe respect that it deserves, and<br />\nthat's all I can really say on that<br />\none. Because when you write a<br />\nsong, you have a certain feel in<br />\nmind. I rather go by the feel of<br />\nthe song rather than what the style<br />\nof the current climate of production is, or the climate of what we<br />\ndid on the last album. We have<br />\nour own musical style, our own<br />\nway we approach things. But<br />\nbasically, we just go by what suits<br />\nthe song. The song is the cornerstone of everything. really.<br />\nIs there anything you'd like to<br />\nchange about this album or whish<br />\nyou had done differently?<br />\nI just wish we could've recorded it even faster. We recorded it<br />\nin six weeks and mixed it in six<br />\nweeks. I just wish that nowadays<br />\nalbums could be made in about<br />\ntwo weeks. It's a shame really,<br />\nbut that's life. No, I wouldn't actually change anything, no.<br />\nDo you think one ofthe reasons<br />\nit took so long to get this out was<br />\nbecause you were putting so much<br />\nmore production value into it?<br />\nSix weeks? (laughs) I think that<br />\nanswers that question.<br />\nOne final thing, just out of<br />\ncuriosity. As I was looking at the<br />\nalbum cover this morning, I noticed that you seem to be giving<br />\nDave Sharp a rather stern look.<br />\nWhat's the situation here?<br />\n(Laughing) He's just a better<br />\nlooking guy than I am.<br /><br />\n14/DECEMBER 11, 1987<br /><br />\nManiacs: Bop 'till you drop at Shriver Hall<br />\nby Jeffrey M. Per!stein<br />\nMonday night at Shriver Hall,<br />\nthe 10,000 Maniacs brought their<br />\nunique blend of countryprogressive-\"rock-a-billy\"dance music to town and sent the<br />\njoint jumping. Headlining a triple<br />\nbill which also included Miracle<br />\nLegion and Karen Goldberg, this<br />\nband that previously opened for<br />\nR.E.M. thrilled the audience with<br />\nan engaging concert performance. The tremendously gifted<br />\nvocalist and her very tight backing band provided an energetic<br />\nevening of danceable tunes for all<br />\nwho attended.<br />\nFollowing a quick comment<br />\nabout Kerouac and Cassidy, the<br />\ndownbeat by the drummer sent<br />\nThe Maniacs rocking through<br />\ntheir first two songs. The<br />\nunderstated dress of the vocalist<br />\nparalleled the modest rhythms of<br />\nthe early numbers. Garbed in a<br />\nsimple, black outfit, white stockings, and a black shawl, physically she projected a very plain and<br />\ngirlish image. However, one<br />\nrecognized from the outset that<br />\nshe was completely in control of<br />\nthe band, the music, and the<br />\naudience.<br />\nAs she belted out the first<br />\nseveral melodies, the sheer power<br />\nof her voice was evident. Sitting<br />\non the edge of the stage and<br />\ndelivering a tune with definite<br />\ncountry influences, she commanded the audience's attention.<br />\nThe crowd wilingly responded<br />\nand she remarked that they were<br />\n\"very quiet and courteous.\"<br />\nAs if intending to shake them<br />\nfrom this passively polite state,<br />\nthe next song was a haunting<br />\nnumber with a furious drum beat.<br />\nThe visual effect of ghoulish<br />\nshadows dancing upon the wall<br />\ncombined with a bizarre guitar effect resembling whale calls<br />\nhelped to enhance the unsettling<br />\nnature of the piece.<br />\nThe performance then changed<br />\ndirection, exploring a more<br />\ndanceable avenue. Introduced as<br /><br />\n\"a song that Jerry (the drummer)<br />\nwrote,\" the latin feel of the next<br />\ntune brought many fans to their<br />\nfeet. The choreography of the<br />\nvocalist was very appropriate,<br />\nmimicking a cha-cha or rhumba,<br />\nand effectively coaxed many<br />\nmembers of the audience to do the<br />\nsame. Along the sides and back<br />\nof the theatre, people gyrated to<br />\nthe \"South of the Border,\" accompaniment lent to the piece by<br />\nthe keyboardist. By the second<br />\nsong following the drumer's composition, about sixty fans had boldly approached the front of the<br />\nstage and were bopping to the<br />\nbeat. Their energy and daring encouraged others to dance up<br />\nfront: about one hundred all told.<br />\nThe rest of the audience responded likewise, clapping along with<br />\nthe driving beat and rising, remaining standing until the concert's end.<br />\nThe pace of the performance<br />\nquickened to an intentional<br />\ncrescendo, building to a fever<br />\npitch of cheering and dancing.<br />\nThe 10,000 Maniacs left the stage<br />\njust as the energy had climaxed:<br />\nan intelligently orchestrated performance strategy.

However, following an<br />\nunassuming vocal entrance in<br />\nwhich she stood transfixed, the<br />\nlead singer led The Maniacs<br />\nthrough a truly dance-rhythm<br />\nchorus.

This episode includes<br />\natypical features of depression as<br />\nwell\u2014the individual is often afflicted by hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and an unexplained craving for carbohydrates. Recently,<br />\nseveral forms of therapy have<br />\nbeen suggested for the treatment<br />\nof this disorder; of special interest<br />\nis the role of light in SAD and its<br />\npossible supression of melatonin.<br />\nMelatonin was believed to influence Seasonal Affective<br />\nDisorder in the same manner in<br />\nwhich it effected the adaptation of<br />\nanimals to seasonal changes. Injections of melatonin into animals<br />\ncaused varied results, depending<br />\nupon the time of year. Experiments on golden hamsters<br />\nwere conducted with injections of<br />\nmelatonin and variation of light<br />\nexposure. Those hamsters experiencing short photoperiods<br />\n(i.e. this simulates a shorter<br />\nwinter day) did not undergo<br />\nregression of the gonads which<br />\ntypically is associated with<br />\nshorter photoperiods. Given to<br />\n_ golden hamsters kept on long day<br /><br />\ncycles, regression of the testes<br />\nresulted. While this hormone<br />\ndoes seem to exert some effects<br />\nin the body, the actual role of<br />\nmelatonin is still disputed.<br />\nWehr and colleagues have suggested that morning light<br />\ntreatments are somewhat more effective than later treatments in<br />\ntreating SAD. It is possible that<br />\nthere is some threshold which<br /><br />\ncells require to determine the<br />\nseasonal effect and that midday<br />\nlight treatments surpass that<br />\nthreshold.

This consists of his 1540<br />\nvoyage in search of the rumored<br />\nseven cities of gold through part<br />\nof what is now Mexico and<br />\nSouthwestern United States. Unfortunately, Udall does not cover<br />\nthe entire voyage. For the most<br />\npart he skips Spain and Mexico<br />\nand starts things off right, right<br />\nin lower Arizona.

These past few weeks have been hectic, as I have been around the globe, promoting<br />\nmy new album, The QM Sings, as well as inking a five year deal for The New York Globe. Very<br />\nhectic. The Quizmaster feels guilty for not preparing you all for his long absence, or the coming<br />\nof the QMs. However, the little woman did one hell of a job for a dame, did she not. Me thinkem<br />\nso. You should see what else she can do, and I can't wait until she strings me up. I knew she'd<br />\nmiss me, but the Quizmaster never thought he'd see his fetishes in this rag.

Anyone who<br />\nis in the know realized that number 21 should have read \"Once we were years ahead, but now<br />\nthose thoughts are dead, let me go.\" Thanks to those who did not make a stink about it, but I felt<br />\nobligated.
