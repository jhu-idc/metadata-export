However,<br />\nbecause of the inadequate<br />\nallocation of funds in President<br />\nNixon's higher education funding<br />\nprogram, the BEOG has also<br />\nsuffered cutbacks limiting to<br />\n$452 the maximum grant any<br />\none student can receive from this<br />\nprogram..<br />\nAn additional provision of this<br />\nprogram stipulates that its<br />\nbenefits be made eligible only to<br />\nthose who were not registered in<br />\nan institution of higher education<br />\nprior to July 1 of this year, thus<br />\n<br />\nmaking it available this year to<br />\nfreshmen only.<br />\nAccording to aides Kenneth<br />\nJohnson, Assistant Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid, the largest BEOG<br />\ngrant thus far allocated has been<br />\n$170, though applications are still<br />\nbeing received and processed by<br />\nthat office.<br />\nAs a means to take up some of<br />\nthe slack created by cutbacks in<br />\nthese federally funded programs,<br />\nRiina said that the University had<br />\ntaken action to alleviate some of<br />\nthe financial burden on students<br />\nhaving a need as determined by the<br />\n-FA office and based on their<br />\nParent's Confidential Statement.<br />\nRiina praised President Muller<br />\nfor having subsidized the<br />\nFinancial Aid office with a 24<br />\npercent increase in University<br />\nfunds, increasing that sum from<br />\n$635,000 to $810,000.

For far too long<br />\nstudents here have had to put up with intense rivalry for a<br />\nlimited number of respectable grades:, this process serves only<br />\nto alienatc the student who wants to learn, but who dislikes the<br />\ncutthroat competition prevalent here.<br />\nGiven that the purpose of the Hopkins undergraduate<br />\nprogram is to teach the student something, it seems absurd to<br />\nrequire that he be graded when for one reason or another, he<br />\nhasn't learned very much.<br />\n<br />\n\"i am the dean\"<br />\n<br />\nDuring the annual \"Well, let's see what's in our photo<br />\nfiles\" office craze, members of the News-Letter staff discovered the flu/owing photographs.

Cox has fielded a pair of<br />\n6-3 teams in his first two years at<br />\nHopkins, and hopes to do as well<br />\nas 1972's third place finish this<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe strongest aspect of the<br />\nsquad this year appears to be the<br />\ndefensive backfield, where<br />\n<br />\nseniors Harry Stringer and Bill<br />\nNolan _team up with Jack Coulte,<br />\nand Rick Kramer to give the Blue<br />\nJays an experienced secondary.<br />\nThe linebacking unit also looks<br />\nstrong although the loss of Craig<br />\nStevens was a discouraging blow.<br />\nStevens had a knee operation in<br />\nAugust which will sideline him<br />\nfor most of the season.<br />\nCo-captain Gunter Blocker, will<br />\nbe calling the defensive signals<br />\nwith senior Jim Moran and<br />\nfreshman Bob Maimone rounding<br />\nout that important trio.<br />\nThe defensive line is currently<br />\nbeing manned by Mike O'Brien<br />\nand Keith Krantz on the inside<br />\nwith Ron Hall and Bruce Parker<br />\non the ends.

Portions of the recent<br />\nscrimmages showed promise of<br />\nfulfilling these hopes.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Jays can<br />\nsometimes be as cold as they can<br />\nbe hot. \u2022<br />\nVeterans<br />\nWith a good number of<br />\nreturning veterans in the ranks<br />\nand the addition of a substantial<br />\nnumber of freshmen to fill the<br />\nempty spots, the Hopkins team<br />\nshould stand up well in its league.<br />\nVarsity coach Robert Oliver is<br />\nmore than anxious not only to<br />\nreverse but expand upon last<br />\nyear's six one-goal defeats.<br />\nBack in the nets for the Jays<br />\nwill be senior co-captain Keith<br />\nNaunheim and his sophomore<br />\nteammate, Jack Bukowski. Both<br />\nproved to be very capable goalies<br />\nand only Coach Oliver knows<br />\nwhich will start in the coming<br />\nseason. Naunheim feels that the<br />\nteam will be in much better<br />\nphysical shape than last year<br />\nbecause of the double session<br />\npractices they underwent before<br />\nschool began.<br />\nAt the opposite end of the<br />\n<br />\nfield will be senior lettermen<br />\nRichard Theibert, co-captain Phil<br />\nHieter and last year's leading<br />\nscorer Roberto Arguero.<br />\nThe midfield will contain<br />\nmany incoming freshmen<br />\nprospects, including Gary<br />\nIgatowski, Andre Lacis, and Tom<br />\nMyrick. Junior Charlie Gilman<br />\nand sophomores Lou Podrazik,<br />\nJoe Rutkowski, Ami Cohen, and<br />\nAl Tramposch will help round<br />\nout the rest of the field.<br />\nWhat was evident in last year's<br />\nteam and seems to have carrieG<br />\nover slightly to this year's squad<br />\nis the reluctance o( the Jays to<br />\nshoot the ball when the chance<br />\narises. The only obvious way to<br />\nget a goal is to take a shot, ana<br />\nthe best way to get more goals is<br />\nto take more shots. The Jays will<br />\ntry to perfect their skills and<br />\nabilities during this week's<br />\npreseason games so that they will<br />\nbe ready for the opening game of<br />\nthe season against Haverford here<br />\nSeptember 22. The Hopkins<br />\nbooters certainly have their work<br />\ncut out for them with eight home<br />\ngames and five away trips.<br />\nThe Jays have the talent and<br />\nskills in their players and a good<br />\ncoach who can put it all together<br />\nto make for a winning season.<br />\nThe feeling last year was that<br />\nLady Luck sat with the opposing<br />\nteam.

However,<br />\nbecause of the inadequate<br />\nallocation of funds in President<br />\nNixon's higher education funding<br />\nprogram, the BEOG has also<br />\nsuffered cutbacks limiting to<br />\n$452 the maximum grant any<br />\none student can receive from this<br />\nprogram..<br />\nAn additional provision of this<br />\nprogram stipulates that its<br />\nbenefits be made eligible only to<br />\nthose who were not registered in<br />\nan institution of higher education<br />\nprior to July 1 of this year, thus<br /><br />\nmaking it available this year to<br />\nfreshmen only.<br />\nAccording to aides Kenneth<br />\nJohnson, Assistant Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid, the largest BEOG<br />\ngrant thus far allocated has been<br />\n$170, though applications are still<br />\nbeing received and processed by<br />\nthat office.<br />\nAs a means to take up some of<br />\nthe slack created by cutbacks in<br />\nthese federally funded programs,<br />\nRiina said that the University had<br />\ntaken action to alleviate some of<br />\nthe financial burden on students<br />\nhaving a need as determined by the<br />\n-FA office and based on their<br />\nParent's Confidential Statement.<br />\nRiina praised President Muller<br />\nfor having subsidized the<br />\nFinancial Aid office with a 24<br />\npercent increase in University<br />\nfunds, increasing that sum from<br />\n$635,000 to $810,000. Part of<br />\nthis increase is commensurate<br />\nwith the $300 increase in tuition<br />\neffective as this year. This<br />\nsubsidy has been proportionately<br />\nallocated to all classes of<br />\nundergraduates, thus relieving<br />\nsome of the financial burden on<br />\nreturning students, now<br />\nineligible for the BEOG program<br />\nas determined by its federal<br />\nguidelines.<br />\nAs a further effort to alleviate<br />\nsome of the financial woes, the<br />\nuniversity has been named a<br />\nmoney lender under the<br />\nprovisions of the Federally<br />\nInsured Student Loan (FISL)<br />\nprogram.<br />\nThrough this program, eligible<br />\nstudents can borrow an amount<br />\nof money recommended by the<br />\nUniversity up to $1500<br />\nmaximum, either through a<br /><br />\ncommercial institution or, as of<br />\nnow, through the university<br />\nitself.

Savitz's call both for<br />\nan unlimited pass/fail option and for an ABC-no credit grading<br />\nplan deserve serious consideration. Certainly the SC President's<br />\nsuggestion is not as novel as its detractors may suggest; as<br />\nestimable a person as former Homewood Dean G. Wilson<br />\nShaffer made the latter proposal many years ago.<br />\nFor a University as dedicated to teaching and research as<br />\nHopkins is, grades, records and transcripts often seern an<br />\nunncessary intrusion into the serious business of the institution.<br />\nCertainly no professor writing a book or investigating properties<br />\nof the gene wants to spend his time grading papers or reading<br />\nlab reports, and this work inevitably ends up in the hands of<br />\nreluctant and harried graduate students whose evaluations are<br />\noften neither perceptive nor considered.<br />\nWhile we recognize that certain students will want to<br />\ncontinue to receive grades for use in applications to graduate<br />\nand professional schools, we see no reason why a student who<br />\ndoes not want to put up with the petty aggravations of marks<br />\nand grading should have to do so.<br />\nAs for Mr. Savitz's second proposal, under which a student<br />\nwould receive a grade of A, B, or C or no credit (and no record)<br />\nfor his courses, we feel that this plan would shift the emphasis<br />\nof a Hopkins education from competition for grades back to the<br />\nacquisition of knowledge, where it belongs. For far too long<br />\nstudents here have had to put up with intense rivalry for a<br />\nlimited number of respectable grades:, this process serves only<br />\nto alienatc the student who wants to learn, but who dislikes the<br />\ncutthroat competition prevalent here.<br />\nGiven that the purpose of the Hopkins undergraduate<br />\nprogram is to teach the student something, it seems absurd to<br />\nrequire that he be graded when for one reason or another, he<br />\nhasn't learned very much.<br /><br />\n\"i am the dean\"<br /><br />\nDuring the annual \"Well, let's see what's in our photo<br />\nfiles\" office craze, members of the News-Letter staff discovered the flu/owing photographs.

Cox has fielded a pair of<br />\n6-3 teams in his first two years at<br />\nHopkins, and hopes to do as well<br />\nas 1972's third place finish this<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe strongest aspect of the<br />\nsquad this year appears to be the<br />\ndefensive backfield, where<br /><br />\nseniors Harry Stringer and Bill<br />\nNolan _team up with Jack Coulte,<br />\nand Rick Kramer to give the Blue<br />\nJays an experienced secondary.<br />\nThe linebacking unit also looks<br />\nstrong although the loss of Craig<br />\nStevens was a discouraging blow.<br />\nStevens had a knee operation in<br />\nAugust which will sideline him<br />\nfor most of the season.<br />\nCo-captain Gunter Blocker, will<br />\nbe calling the defensive signals<br />\nwith senior Jim Moran and<br />\nfreshman Bob Maimone rounding<br />\nout that important trio.<br />\nThe defensive line is currently<br />\nbeing manned by Mike O'Brien<br />\nand Keith Krantz on the inside<br />\nwith Ron Hall and Bruce Parker<br />\non the ends. Hall is considered<br />\nthe best Hopkins defensive\u2018end in<br />\nthree years, though a knee injury<br />\nin Saturday's<br />\nsuffered<br />\nscrimmage may hamper his play<br />\nin the early games.<br />\nOffensively, the Blue Jays have<br />\nfew veterans returning beside<br /><br />\nSoccer shaping up<br />\nFor '73-'74 season<br />\nWith three scrimmages uncle'<br />\nthe belts of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nsoccer team and three more to go<br />\nthrough this week, the Blue Jay<br />\nbooters are starting to show the<br />\nmaking of a soccer team.<br />\nThe future hope of this year's<br />\nsquad is simple; improve on the<br />\nresults of last year's losing<br />\nrecord. Portions of the recent<br />\nscrimmages showed promise of<br />\nfulfilling these hopes.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Jays can<br />\nsometimes be as cold as they can<br />\nbe hot. \u2022<br />\nVeterans<br />\nWith a good number of<br />\nreturning veterans in the ranks<br />\nand the addition of a substantial<br />\nnumber of freshmen to fill the<br />\nempty spots, the Hopkins team<br />\nshould stand up well in its league.<br />\nVarsity coach Robert Oliver is<br />\nmore than anxious not only to<br />\nreverse but expand upon last<br />\nyear's six one-goal defeats.<br />\nBack in the nets for the Jays<br />\nwill be senior co-captain Keith<br />\nNaunheim and his sophomore<br />\nteammate, Jack Bukowski. Both<br />\nproved to be very capable goalies<br />\nand only Coach Oliver knows<br />\nwhich will start in the coming<br />\nseason. Naunheim feels that the<br />\nteam will be in much better<br />\nphysical shape than last year<br />\nbecause of the double session<br />\npractices they underwent before<br />\nschool began.<br />\nAt the opposite end of the<br /><br />\nfield will be senior lettermen<br />\nRichard Theibert, co-captain Phil<br />\nHieter and last year's leading<br />\nscorer Roberto Arguero.<br />\nThe midfield will contain<br />\nmany incoming freshmen<br />\nprospects, including Gary<br />\nIgatowski, Andre Lacis, and Tom<br />\nMyrick. Junior Charlie Gilman<br />\nand sophomores Lou Podrazik,<br />\nJoe Rutkowski, Ami Cohen, and<br />\nAl Tramposch will help round<br />\nout the rest of the field.<br />\nWhat was evident in last year's<br />\nteam and seems to have carrieG<br />\nover slightly to this year's squad<br />\nis the reluctance o( the Jays to<br />\nshoot the ball when the chance<br />\narises. The only obvious way to<br />\nget a goal is to take a shot, ana<br />\nthe best way to get more goals is<br />\nto take more shots. The Jays will<br />\ntry to perfect their skills and<br />\nabilities during this week's<br />\npreseason games so that they will<br />\nbe ready for the opening game of<br />\nthe season against Haverford here<br />\nSeptember 22. The Hopkins<br />\nbooters certainly have their work<br />\ncut out for them with eight home<br />\ngames and five away trips.<br />\nThe Jays have the talent and<br />\nskills in their players and a good<br />\ncoach who can put it all together<br />\nto make for a winning season.<br />\nThe feeling last year was that<br />\nLady Luck sat with the opposing<br />\nteam. Maybe she'll come over to<br />\nthe Hopkins side or forget to<br />\ncome all together this year.<br /><br />\nPhil Alba in last year's grid action<br />\nco-captain Jack Thomas and Bill<br />\nNolan. Quarterback Thomas gives<br />\nthe squad poised leadership and a<br />\ntalented passing arm that<br />\nproduced 969 yards and 11<br />\ntouchdowns for Hopkins in 1972.<br />\nOnce again, Billy Norbeck will<br />\nact as understudy following a<br />\nseason of preparation with both<br />\nthe varsity and JV teams last<br />\nyear.<br />\nBackfield<br />\nThe rest of the backfield was<br />\ndecimated by graduation, as only<br />\nPhil Alba returns. Alba broke<br />\ninto the starting lineup late in the<br />\nseason last year, but still<br />\nmanaged to rank second on the<br />\nteam's rushing list. Two others<br />\nvying for the halfback post are<br />\nBill Jones and Tom Cirillo.<br />\nMeanwhile, sophomore Ted<br />\nStafaniw is working out as<br />\nfullback.

The pair<br />\naveraged around 40 yards a punt<br />\nfor the Blue Jays in 1972, while<br />\nThomas handled the field goal<br />\nand point-after-touchdown<br />\nscoring.<br />\nThe Hopkins eleven will be<br />\nbigger and stronger than in past<br />\nyears, according to Coach Cox, as<br />\nthe depth should remain about<br />\nthe same. Forty eight candidates<br />\nshowed up for the opening<br />\nsessions of practice and 43 are<br />\nstill with the team in spite of the<br />\noppressive weather of the first<br />\nweek. If this is indicative of the<br />\ndedication of the Blue Jays this<br />\nyear, Cox may well have the type<br />\nof season he expects.<br /><br />\nFaculty nails SC in softball 17-6<br />\nThe Faculty-Administration<br />\nsoftball squad took advantage of<br />\nearly Student Council defensive<br />\nlapses and dumped the<br />\nundergrads, 17-6, in an exhibition<br />\ngame Saturday afternoon.

Four linemen graduated<br />\nfrom the 1972 Blue Jays<br />\nincluding captain Sam Palmisano.<br />\nCox will be counting heavily on<br />\nreturning right side blockers John<br />\nNutting at guard and Jim Duffey<br />\nat tackle. Four candidates who<br />\nalso look strong are Jack<br />\nMc Enaney, Mike Kuby, Mike<br />\nBrandt and Jim Moran, whom<br />\nCox says is particularly<br />\npromising. Brandt played tackle<br />\nlast year and should help anchor<br />\nthe new line.<br />\nOn, the receiving end of<br />\nThomas' passes will be Nolan and<br />\nMike Bogdan. Nolan is being<br />\nshi fted from flanker to split<br />\nreceiver as Coach Cox hopes to<br />\nmake better use of his speed.<br /><br />\n4:30.
