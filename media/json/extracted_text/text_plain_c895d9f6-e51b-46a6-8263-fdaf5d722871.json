Goodrich<br />\nbelieves one has a better chance<br />\nof screening out good potential<br />\ncommittee members by<br />\ninterviewing rather than by<br />\nelections.<br />\nUnreglistic<br />\nThe BRP requirement that the<br />\ntrial panel of nine students must<br />\nvote unanimously to convict a<br />\nstudent is \"unrealistic because<br />\nthere is always apt, to be one<br />\nmember not wanting to declare a<br />\nstrict penalty,\" said Goodrich. .<br />\nHe also opposes changing the<br />\npresent defense procedure. Under<br />\n.the present constitution an<br />\n<br />\nindicted student is allowed to<br />\nhave the aid of a defense council,<br />\nwho must be a member of the<br />\ncommittee not on the trial panel.<br />\nDefense Council<br />\nBut defense councils work to<br />\nuphold the honor code<br />\nconstitution. They try to extract<br />\nall the facts, even if<br />\nincriminatory to the student.<br />\nThe BRP is proposing that a<br />\nstudent be allowed to choose his<br />\ndefense council from any one in<br />\nthe undergraduate student body.<br />\nAccording to Goodrich this could<br />\nlead to retrogression into the<br />\nadvocate system. He believes<br />\nsuch a system is inoperable unless<br />\none has a detailed knowledge of<br />\nlaw.<br />\n<br />\nBecause of this late starting<br />\ndate, the Employment Service<br />\nwill first concentrate on finding<br />\nsummer employment for<br />\nHopkins students, Benton stated.<br />\n\"I see the goal of the Service<br />\nas double edged\u2014drumming up<br />\njobs for students and paying<br />\nstudents with those jobs,\"<br />\nBenton remarked.<br />\nThe Employment Service was<br />\noriginally intended to begin<br />\nFebruary 1, but was postponed a<br />\nmonth when its perspective<br />\ndirector accepted another job<br />\nwith the Evening College on Jan.<br />\n29 and University officials<br />\ndecided last week to place the<br />\nService in the Personnel Office.<br />\nBenton stressed that the<br />\nservice will \"systematically<br />\ncanvass within the University\"<br />\nfor possible jobs before soliciting<br />\nalumni and community<br />\nbusinesses.<br />\nNoting that there is a \"fairly<br />\nhigh turnover [of jobs] on<br />\ncampus,\" Benton admitted, \"We<br />\nhaven't adequately found jobs<br />\nfor students on campus.\"<br />\nThe Service will begin without<br />\na permanent director but Benton<br />\nsaid that \"Whoever is going to<br />\nhead this service will spend a lot<br />\nof time out of the office and in<br />\nthe community.\"<br />\nThe Employment Service was<br />\nfirst conceived last October, in<br />\nresponse to President Muller's<br />\nannouncement of a $300 tuition<br />\nincrease at last fall's meeting of<br />\nthe faculty General Assembly on<br />\nSeptember 29,1972.<br />\nThe 'woman scheduled to<br />\ndirect the Service, Ruby Harris,<br />\naccepted a counselor position<br />\nwith the Evening College.<br />\nAt the present time, the<br />\nmajority of part time jobs<br />\navailable to students are federally<br />\nfunded work-study jobs available<br />\nthrough the financial aid office.<br />\n<br />\nRI Byrd,<br />\n<br />\nstudent,dies<br />\nRobert J.

The:<br />\npercentages for people interested in<br />\nhealth fields (but not including<br />\npre-medical st tidies) have increased from<br />\n5.3 (1966) to 10.6 (1972). In the<br />\nhumanities, the figures are 4.7 (1966) to<br />\n3.6 (1972). So the 3.8% of our applicants<br />\nexpressing an interest in the Humanities is<br />\nactually above the national average. Our<br />\n.applicants definitely show national<br />\ntrends.<br />\nDoes this mean that the admissions<br />\n- office actually has no control over the<br />\ndistribution ofits applicants?<br />\n,<br />\nThey certainly can not be controlled<br />\nby this office. It is the duty of this office<br />\nto understand the trends and work with<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe fact that our Humanities<br />\n,applicants are 3.8% of the total doesn't<br />\n- please me personally, and we knwo that<br />\nthe faculty and students would like to see<br />\nmore Humanities students. But when I<br />\nsee that 3.6% is the national figure, I'm<br />\nnot so alarmed. I don't see that we have<br />\nto be right on the line with national<br />\n\u2022 trends.<br />\nDo you think outside groups, such as<br />\nfaculty members, should take a larger<br />\npart in the admissions procedures in an<br />\neffort to change the distribution?<br />\nWe do have a faculty advising<br />\ncommittee now, and the members offer<br />\nsuggestions on all parts of the admissions<br />\nprocess. My intuition tells me. after<br />\ndiscussing the matter with people in the<br />\nHopkins community, that they are giving<br />\n\u2022 .more, suggestions about recruiting devices<br />\nbecause the matter has dramatically come<br />\nto their attention and, I like to think,<br />\nbecause they have a sympathetic ear. We<br />\nmust gear up to make better use of our<br />\nstudents and faculty in the recruiting<br />\nprocess.<br />\nWill the imbalance in the applicant<br />\npool remain in the group that is<br />\naccepted?<br />\nNo. You get a different yield in each<br />\n, and every one of these groups (i.e.,<br />\nHumanities, Natural Sciences, Social and<br />\nBehavioral Sciences, Quantitative<br />\nStudies). The percentage of acceptances<br />\nin each category will differ from the<br />\nfigures from the total pool of. applicants.<br />\nThe yield (i.e., the number of people who<br />\nactually enroll in Hopkins) is another<br />\nfactor. The figures we have now are<br />\none-third of the voyage. But no matter<br />\n, what you do to them, we know that<br />\nHumanities students will be the smallest<br />\n. group in next year:s class, as is the case<br />\nnationally.<br />\nIf I apply to Hopkins saying that I'm<br />\ninterested in the Humanities, philosophy,<br />\nfor instance, will I be more likely to be<br />\nadmitted than if I had the exact same<br />\nqualifications but applied in the Natural<br />\nSciences?<br />\n<br />\nf STAND<br />\n<br />\nWell, it's not likely that you'd be the<br />\nsame.<br />\nSay that I have a twin. My class rank is<br />\n25, my twin's is 26. I'm applying as a<br />\npotential philosophy major, and he's<br />\napplying in the Natural Sciences: is it<br />\neasier for me to get in?<br />\nEasier is just a poor choice of word.<br />\nPerhaps I should go back and comment<br />\non the admissions process. People are<br />\njudged in relation to the overall pool (of<br />\napplicants). We have a limitation on the<br />\nnumber of Natural Science people we can<br />\naccept-the limits come from the lack of<br />\nlaboratory space, and, of course, our<br />\nneeds for a good class distribution. So if<br />\nyou are a Natural Science student seeking<br />\nadmission, the pool in which you are<br />\ncompeting in larger (than that of a<br />\n<br />\ndown history for a major, but then say<br />\n\"eye surgeon\" for professional goal.<br />\nWe have very capable students in all<br />\nthe other areas. We turn away and do not<br />\naccept many well-qualified Natural<br />\nScience people because of lack of space.<br />\nWe have not turned away people in other<br />\nareas, but each has it's own high<br />\nrequirements.<br />\nLet's go back to those hypothetical<br />\ntwins for a moment. IfI'm a black person<br />\nwith the same record as my White twin,<br />\n.will it be easier for me to get into<br />\nHopkins? Or, to use .your term, will the<br />\nadmissions process be less rigorous for<br />\nme?<br />\nLet's use the word competitive, I think<br />\nthat's what you want.

Adequate<br />\neating facilities, where students, faculty, and employees can dine together without feeling revulsion at the<br />\ntime, and indigestion shortly afterwards, are, of<br />\ncourse, desirable .<br />\nAs recently as 1971, Homewood had a fine dining<br />\nfacility in Levering Hall. Unfortunately, with such nasty difficulties as a multi-million annual budgeted deficit and labor negotiations at hand, interim president<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower took the University out of the<br />\ncanteen business, and opted for a vending machine facility. Macke Foods moved in with a garish, unsavory<br />\nservice, which only last summer made some minor improvements.<br />\nProphet Foods, which has held the dormitory food<br />\ncontract for two years, came under attack last fall<br />\nwhen Homewood Vice President George Benton, Dean<br />\nof Students Robert Fitzpatrick, and others correctly<br />\ntook note that Prophet's managerial ineptitude involved a possible breach of contract.

In the meantime, we'll take an Alka-Seltzer.<br />\n<br />\nCries: beautiful unity<br />\n<br />\nvisible. The scene records the agony of<br />\nthe spasm; the dynamic conflict which<br />\nexists within the frame here is<br />\nextraordinary. Agnes is writhing in pain,<br />\nbut the stillness of the dormant white<br />\nlace pillowcase on which she lies looms<br />\ninto the viewer's mind. One feels its<br />\nsoftness and purity and at the same time<br />\nsees the agony of the spasm.<br />\nThe moment seems to last forever. The<br />\nduration of Agnes's pain is captured by<br />\nthe length of the scene, and the static<br />\nquality arises from this. Had the camera<br />\nrecorded less of the spasm, the effect<br />\nwould not have been the same. I recall<br />\nloosing track of how long I had been<br />\nwatching Agnes, as I was totally caught<br />\nup in the momentaryness of, her pain. The<br />\ncomposition of the frame, the actress's<br />\namazing performance, and the actual<br />\nlength of the scene pulls the viewer so<br />\ndeeply into the film that this event, this<br />\nmoving figure in pain, is jolted to a halt.<br />\nOf course Bergman could not have<br />\ncreated the effectiveness here if the acting<br />\nhad not been much more than<br />\ncompetent.

The vicars of the various Parish<br />\nChurches which house the efficies usually<br />\nsuggest that a contribution be made for<br />\nthe right to make rubbings of them, and<br />\nthere are fees of up to SI for the right to<br />\nrub the more popular monuments.<br />\nThe display of brass rubbings in the<br />\nEisenhower Library is part of the two<br />\nhundred member collection belonging to<br />\nDr. and Mrs. Verl S. Lewis of Rogers<br />\nFort, Maryland. Most of the rubbings<br />\nwere made in the winters of 1970 and<br />\n1971, when the churches were, as Mrs.<br />\nLewis said, like \"walk-in freezers.\" The<br />\nsmall Parish Churches are not heated<br />\nduring the week, and so the industrious<br />\nvisitor, clad in woolen underwear and<br />\ngloves, must keel for hours on a cold<br />\nstone floor, where most of the<br />\nmonuments are found. These<br />\nmonuments, which are two-dimensional<br />\nlikenesses of members of the small ruling<br />\nclass of medieval England, are made of<br />\n<br />\nbrass set into the stone which covers the<br />\ntombs of the nobles. The brass rubbings<br />\nthemselves are simply paper<br />\nreproductions of the raised images which<br />\nare created by rubbing the papercovered<br />\nfigure with pigmented wax, much as<br />\nchildren Make copies of Abraham Lincoln<br />\nby covering pennies with paper and<br />\nrubbing crayons over them.<br />\nThe noblemen, the thirteenth to<br />\nseventeenth century descendants of the<br />\nold Norman families, arranged before<br />\ntheir deaths to have effigies made of brass<br />\nplaced on their tombs. Many of these<br />\nnoblemen were great figures in England's<br />\nreligious history. yet they were buried in<br />\nsmall churches rather than in cathedrals<br />\nin order to commerorate people who had<br />\nbeen important to the community. The<br />\nsize of the brass was dependent upon the<br />\nwealth of the nobleman-the more money<br />\nhe was able to pay, the larger the image<br />\nwas.<br />\nAbout 7500 monuments exist in<br />\nEnglish churches today, but there were<br />\noriginally close to 100,000. The Civil War<br />\nof 1644, the Great Fire of London in<br />\n1666, and World War Two bombings were<br />\n<br />\nthe main causes for the destruction oi<br />\nmost of the effigies. The oldest existing<br />\nbrass is dated 1277 and is of Sir John<br />\nD'Abernon of Surrey, whose rubbing<br />\nhangs to the right of the front doors of<br />\nthe library. Among the other rubbings<br />\nnow in the library are those of Anne<br />\nBoleyn and her father, the grandfather of<br />\nElizabeth II.<br />\nThe armor, clothing, and headresses of<br />\nthe effigies are accurate, but the features<br />\nof the persons are not, for they depended<br />\non the whim of the engraver. The classic<br />\nmedieval nose was long and straight, and<br />\nmost of the images have this type of nose,<br />\nfor the engravers formed the faces as they<br />\ndesired them to appear. This is part of the<br />\nexplanation for the remarkable similarity<br />\nbetween many of the faces in the<br />\nrubbings, and the other part is that the<br />\nsame engraver might have done effigies in<br />\nmore than one church. The clerical class,<br />\nwhich formed an important part of the<br />\nruling elite, is denoted by long robes<br />\nwhile knights wear the armor of then<br />\nday. Mrs. Lewis has done a remarkable<br />\nstudy of the headresses of the women<br />\npictured in the monuments, including<br />\n<br />\nhairstyles and head coverings. (She even<br />\nnotes that the long flowing hair of Cecile<br />\nBoleyn signifies spinsterhood.)<br />\nThe figures in the brasses are portrayed<br />\nin a prone position with clasped hands,<br />\nfor the most part as they would appear in<br />\ndeath, although their eyes are open. The<br />\nfootrests of the knights are indications of<br />\nthe manner in which they died-those<br />\nwho rest their feet on lions died in battle,<br />\nwhile those whose feet rest on dogs did<br />\nnot. (Sir Roger de Trunpington's dog has<br />\ngrotesquely long toenails and is biting the<br />\nend of Sir Roger's sword.) The knight's<br />\nheadrests are their helmets, while the<br />\nladies heads rest on cushions.<br />\nThe impact of these brass rubbings on<br />\nthe observer is due not only to their<br />\nbeauty, but also to the sense of history<br />\nthey convey. The observer finds himself<br />\ngrowing attached to certain figures. The<br />\nrubbing of John Tyringham is one of the<br />\nsmaller ones, yet it is my favorite and<br />\ncoincidentally the favorite of Mrs. Lewis<br />\nand the first she did. John wears a<br />\npointed hat and rests his feet on a dog.<br />\nBut man's best friend has its tongue<br />\nsticking out.<br />\n<br />\nThe meaning seems almost too obvious:<br />\n-physical contact as the basis of<br />\ncommunication. The maid Anna is the<br />\nonly person who is capable of such<br />\ncommunication. She shows \"normal\"<br />\nemotion (that is, tears) only in one scene,<br />\nand yet she is the only person who can<br />\ncommunicate truthfully. One begins to<br />\nsee the falseness in the outward signs of<br />\nthe two sisters' emotionalism. It seems<br />\nthat all the tears in the world mean very<br />\nlittle.<br />\nOne gets the feeling that Bergman is<br />\nblurring some concepts that are normally<br />\ndistinguishable. Like the still photograph,<br />\nhis film seems to freeze the movement'of<br />\ntime and replace it with the movement of<br />\nspace. Also appearance and reality is<br />\nunified. Tears are not as appearance of<br />\nemotion; they are, simply, false emotion.<br />\nMaria's dress is not a signifier of what<br />\nMaria really is; the dress is Maria-all<br />\nseductive lace and false physicality.<br />\nCries and Whispers is a film that pulls<br />\nthe viewer into the frame. One is forced<br />\nto touch, to move about in a realm of<br />\nspace without time. Physicality stands as<br />\nthe film's dominant motif and Berman's<br />\ntechnique stands hand in hand with the<br />\nmeaning. The film is a masterpiece of the<br />\nunity of style and content.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/news-letter/march 2, 1973<br />\n<br />\napplecrombie & fitch<br />\nfri. march 2<br />\n<br />\nsat. march 3<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\n<br />\nDance<br />\nThe Louis Falco Dance<br />\nCompany\u2014Kraushaar<br />\nAuditorium Goucher College.<br />\n8:30 pm, General admission<br />\n$4.00, students $2.50<br />\nTheatre<br />\n\"Where's Charley\" The<br />\nSpotlight Theatre. 817 St. Paul<br />\nSt. For info call 752-1225.<br />\n<br />\nSwimming, MAC<br />\nChampionships, Elizabethtown,<br />\nNew Jersey.<br />\n<br />\nFilms<br />\n\"Adventures of Robin Hood\"<br />\nwith Errol Flynn and \"Prisoner<br />\nof Zenda\" 7:30 pm in Shaffer 3.<br />\n$1.<br />\n<br />\nLecture<br />\nMartin Luther King, Jr.<br />\n, Lectureship \u2014Coretta King<br />\nspeaking. 8 pm Shriver Hall.<br />\nFree.<br />\n<br />\n\"Butch Cassidy and the<br />\nSundance Kid\" in Levering Hall.<br />\n7:30 and 9:30 pm. $I.<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nMusic<br />\nChester's Place, Levering Hall.<br />\n8:30 pm. $.75.<br />\n<br />\nTHE HUNGRIES<br />\nFOR HARLEY'S<br />\n<br />\nSee Paul Newman<br />\nRobert Redford in<br />\n<br />\n3111 St. Paul Street<br />\n<br />\nButch Cassidy and<br />\nthe Sundance Kid<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nSwimming, MAC<br />\nChampionships, Elizabethtown,<br />\nNew Jersey.<br />\nFencing, MAC Championships,<br />\nMadison, New Jersey.<br />\n<br />\nsun. march 4<br />\nFilms<br />\n\"Butch Cassidy and the<br />\nSundance Kid\" in Levering Hall.<br />\n7:30 and 9:30 pm. $1.<br />\n<br />\nJSA BRUNCH<br />\n<br />\nin Cinemascope!

Students have<br />\nbeen selected by interviews given<br /><br />\nby committee members.<br />\nBut the BRP report proposes<br />\nthat the members be elected by<br />\nthe student body.

Is this continuing imbalance the<br />\nfault of this office, or is it a sign that the<br />\nschool has no control over the problem?<br />\nJohn Riina: This is a question which is<br />\nof course very important to me, and it's<br />\nof paramount importance to the<br />\ncommunity -it's important to be aware<br />\nand concerned about how we can bring<br />\nabout a different distribution of students.<br />\nBut the problem we have is not unlike<br />\nthat which exists throughout the nation.<br />\nTheChronide of Higher Education, in its<br />\nstatistics<br />\n\\1 issue, supplies<br />\nV CAMVACN<br />\napp&amp;-,-Hirs thief-es-tea in engineering has<br />\ndeclined from 9.8 to 6.9 since 1966, and<br />\nthis parallels our own experience. The:<br />\npercentages for people interested in<br />\nhealth fields (but not including<br />\npre-medical st tidies) have increased from<br />\n5.3 (1966) to 10.6 (1972). In the<br />\nhumanities, the figures are 4.7 (1966) to<br />\n3.6 (1972). So the 3.8% of our applicants<br />\nexpressing an interest in the Humanities is<br />\nactually above the national average. Our<br />\n.applicants definitely show national<br />\ntrends.<br />\nDoes this mean that the admissions<br />\n- office actually has no control over the<br />\ndistribution ofits applicants?<br />\n,<br />\nThey certainly can not be controlled<br />\nby this office. It is the duty of this office<br />\nto understand the trends and work with<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe fact that our Humanities<br />\n,applicants are 3.8% of the total doesn't<br />\n- please me personally, and we knwo that<br />\nthe faculty and students would like to see<br />\nmore Humanities students. But when I<br />\nsee that 3.6% is the national figure, I'm<br />\nnot so alarmed. I don't see that we have<br />\nto be right on the line with national<br />\n\u2022 trends.<br />\nDo you think outside groups, such as<br />\nfaculty members, should take a larger<br />\npart in the admissions procedures in an<br />\neffort to change the distribution?<br />\nWe do have a faculty advising<br />\ncommittee now, and the members offer<br />\nsuggestions on all parts of the admissions<br />\nprocess. My intuition tells me. after<br />\ndiscussing the matter with people in the<br />\nHopkins community, that they are giving<br />\n\u2022 .more, suggestions about recruiting devices<br />\nbecause the matter has dramatically come<br />\nto their attention and, I like to think,<br />\nbecause they have a sympathetic ear. We<br />\nmust gear up to make better use of our<br />\nstudents and faculty in the recruiting<br />\nprocess.<br />\nWill the imbalance in the applicant<br />\npool remain in the group that is<br />\naccepted?<br />\nNo. You get a different yield in each<br />\n, and every one of these groups (i.e.,<br />\nHumanities, Natural Sciences, Social and<br />\nBehavioral Sciences, Quantitative<br />\nStudies). The percentage of acceptances<br />\nin each category will differ from the<br />\nfigures from the total pool of. applicants.<br />\nThe yield (i.e., the number of people who<br />\nactually enroll in Hopkins) is another<br />\nfactor. The figures we have now are<br />\none-third of the voyage.

The scene records the agony of<br />\nthe spasm; the dynamic conflict which<br />\nexists within the frame here is<br />\nextraordinary. Agnes is writhing in pain,<br />\nbut the stillness of the dormant white<br />\nlace pillowcase on which she lies looms<br />\ninto the viewer's mind. One feels its<br />\nsoftness and purity and at the same time<br />\nsees the agony of the spasm.<br />\nThe moment seems to last forever. The<br />\nduration of Agnes's pain is captured by<br />\nthe length of the scene, and the static<br />\nquality arises from this. Had the camera<br />\nrecorded less of the spasm, the effect<br />\nwould not have been the same. I recall<br />\nloosing track of how long I had been<br />\nwatching Agnes, as I was totally caught<br />\nup in the momentaryness of, her pain. The<br />\ncomposition of the frame, the actress's<br />\namazing performance, and the actual<br />\nlength of the scene pulls the viewer so<br />\ndeeply into the film that this event, this<br />\nmoving figure in pain, is jolted to a halt.<br />\nOf course Bergman could not have<br />\ncreated the effectiveness here if the acting<br />\nhad not been much more than<br />\ncompetent.

The vicars of the various Parish<br />\nChurches which house the efficies usually<br />\nsuggest that a contribution be made for<br />\nthe right to make rubbings of them, and<br />\nthere are fees of up to SI for the right to<br />\nrub the more popular monuments.<br />\nThe display of brass rubbings in the<br />\nEisenhower Library is part of the two<br />\nhundred member collection belonging to<br />\nDr. and Mrs. Verl S. Lewis of Rogers<br />\nFort, Maryland. Most of the rubbings<br />\nwere made in the winters of 1970 and<br />\n1971, when the churches were, as Mrs.<br />\nLewis said, like \"walk-in freezers.\" The<br />\nsmall Parish Churches are not heated<br />\nduring the week, and so the industrious<br />\nvisitor, clad in woolen underwear and<br />\ngloves, must keel for hours on a cold<br />\nstone floor, where most of the<br />\nmonuments are found. These<br />\nmonuments, which are two-dimensional<br />\nlikenesses of members of the small ruling<br />\nclass of medieval England, are made of<br /><br />\nbrass set into the stone which covers the<br />\ntombs of the nobles. The brass rubbings<br />\nthemselves are simply paper<br />\nreproductions of the raised images which<br />\nare created by rubbing the papercovered<br />\nfigure with pigmented wax, much as<br />\nchildren Make copies of Abraham Lincoln<br />\nby covering pennies with paper and<br />\nrubbing crayons over them.<br />\nThe noblemen, the thirteenth to<br />\nseventeenth century descendants of the<br />\nold Norman families, arranged before<br />\ntheir deaths to have effigies made of brass<br />\nplaced on their tombs. Many of these<br />\nnoblemen were great figures in England's<br />\nreligious history. yet they were buried in<br />\nsmall churches rather than in cathedrals<br />\nin order to commerorate people who had<br />\nbeen important to the community. The<br />\nsize of the brass was dependent upon the<br />\nwealth of the nobleman-the more money<br />\nhe was able to pay, the larger the image<br />\nwas.<br />\nAbout 7500 monuments exist in<br />\nEnglish churches today, but there were<br />\noriginally close to 100,000. The Civil War<br />\nof 1644, the Great Fire of London in<br />\n1666, and World War Two bombings were<br /><br />\nthe main causes for the destruction oi<br />\nmost of the effigies. The oldest existing<br />\nbrass is dated 1277 and is of Sir John<br />\nD'Abernon of Surrey, whose rubbing<br />\nhangs to the right of the front doors of<br />\nthe library. Among the other rubbings<br />\nnow in the library are those of Anne<br />\nBoleyn and her father, the grandfather of<br />\nElizabeth II.<br />\nThe armor, clothing, and headresses of<br />\nthe effigies are accurate, but the features<br />\nof the persons are not, for they depended<br />\non the whim of the engraver. The classic<br />\nmedieval nose was long and straight, and<br />\nmost of the images have this type of nose,<br />\nfor the engravers formed the faces as they<br />\ndesired them to appear. This is part of the<br />\nexplanation for the remarkable similarity<br />\nbetween many of the faces in the<br />\nrubbings, and the other part is that the<br />\nsame engraver might have done effigies in<br />\nmore than one church. The clerical class,<br />\nwhich formed an important part of the<br />\nruling elite, is denoted by long robes<br />\nwhile knights wear the armor of then<br />\nday. Mrs. Lewis has done a remarkable<br />\nstudy of the headresses of the women<br />\npictured in the monuments, including<br /><br />\nhairstyles and head coverings. (She even<br />\nnotes that the long flowing hair of Cecile<br />\nBoleyn signifies spinsterhood.)<br />\nThe figures in the brasses are portrayed<br />\nin a prone position with clasped hands,<br />\nfor the most part as they would appear in<br />\ndeath, although their eyes are open. The<br />\nfootrests of the knights are indications of<br />\nthe manner in which they died-those<br />\nwho rest their feet on lions died in battle,<br />\nwhile those whose feet rest on dogs did<br />\nnot. (Sir Roger de Trunpington's dog has<br />\ngrotesquely long toenails and is biting the<br />\nend of Sir Roger's sword.) The knight's<br />\nheadrests are their helmets, while the<br />\nladies heads rest on cushions.<br />\nThe impact of these brass rubbings on<br />\nthe observer is due not only to their<br />\nbeauty, but also to the sense of history<br />\nthey convey. The observer finds himself<br />\ngrowing attached to certain figures. The<br />\nrubbing of John Tyringham is one of the<br />\nsmaller ones, yet it is my favorite and<br />\ncoincidentally the favorite of Mrs. Lewis<br />\nand the first she did. John wears a<br />\npointed hat and rests his feet on a dog.<br />\nBut man's best friend has its tongue<br />\nsticking out.<br /><br />\nThe meaning seems almost too obvious:<br />\n-physical contact as the basis of<br />\ncommunication. The maid Anna is the<br />\nonly person who is capable of such<br />\ncommunication. She shows \"normal\"<br />\nemotion (that is, tears) only in one scene,<br />\nand yet she is the only person who can<br />\ncommunicate truthfully. One begins to<br />\nsee the falseness in the outward signs of<br />\nthe two sisters' emotionalism. It seems<br />\nthat all the tears in the world mean very<br />\nlittle.<br />\nOne gets the feeling that Bergman is<br />\nblurring some concepts that are normally<br />\ndistinguishable. Like the still photograph,<br />\nhis film seems to freeze the movement'of<br />\ntime and replace it with the movement of<br />\nspace. Also appearance and reality is<br />\nunified. Tears are not as appearance of<br />\nemotion; they are, simply, false emotion.<br />\nMaria's dress is not a signifier of what<br />\nMaria really is; the dress is Maria-all<br />\nseductive lace and false physicality.<br />\nCries and Whispers is a film that pulls<br />\nthe viewer into the frame. One is forced<br />\nto touch, to move about in a realm of<br />\nspace without time. Physicality stands as<br />\nthe film's dominant motif and Berman's<br />\ntechnique stands hand in hand with the<br />\nmeaning.

The task force<br />\nmembers indicated that gabians<br />\nwould be preferable to concrete<br />\nwalls, but might be too much<br />\ndevelopment for their<br />\nconservationist tastes.<br />\nOn the matter of trash in and<br />\naround Stony Run, task force<br />\nmembers commended Bryn Mawr<br />\nSchool for its beautification<br />\nprogram, and Ian Jewett of<br />\nGilman School mentioned the<br />\npossibility of getting Gilman<br />\nboys to work on the streamside.<br />\nCearfoss noted, \"It's an<br />\ninteresting psychological<br />\nphenomenon that when we get a<br />\nstream area green, people don't<br />\ndump.\" Robert Aro of the City<br />\nParks Department, Druid Hill<br />\nDivision, added,\"The Stony Run<br />\narea doesn't get priority in park<br />\nmaintenance partly because of<br />\nfunds, but that is due to the lack<br />\nof public interest in the area, at<br />\nleast as perceived by the planners<br />\nand political representatives.<br />\nPeople have to show that they<br />\ncare. about Stony Run.\"<br /><br />\nAre you<br />\nTUTORING<br />\nMathematics,<br /><br />\nOFFERED:<br /><br />\nphysics, statistics,<br /><br />\nFortran.
