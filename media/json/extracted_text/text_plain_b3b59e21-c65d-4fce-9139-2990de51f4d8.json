The early part of the<br />\nweek was witness to a rare game of<br />\nmarbles within the precints of the<br />\nsacred court by several more learned of the inmates, namely a Sophomore and Junior. The fascinating<br />\namusement was in progress with<br />\ngolf balls as marbles, but after several perforations of various and<br />\nsundry windows, the sport was<br />\nswitched to the game of golf itself.<br />\nA two-hole course was rapidly constructed in the midst of the lawn<br />\nequipped with all the necessary obstacles as bunkers and traps, the<br />\nformer being furnished by odd bits<br />\nof clothing, while the latter was furnished by a few holes deftly scooped in the turf. Needless to say, the<br />\nwhole course was entirely fairway,<br />\nno out-of-bound limits were established unless the ball chanced to<br />\nwander within the environs of Gilman Hall. At present a horse-shoe<br />\nrange, or whatever the correct<br />\ncognomen maybe, is being organized<br />\nand all contributions for horseshoes will be gladly and graciously<br />\nreceived by any of the students in<br />\nthe hall.<br />\nRecently, in order to hold the<br />\ndignity of the stately hall, one of<br />\nthe Dorm representatives, .suffering from the stimulating effects of<br />\nspring fever, challenged the victim,<br />\nhis chief grudge of the moment to<br />\nmortal combat on the field of honor.<br />\nA referee was selected, and seconds<br />\nappointed to mop up the pools of<br />\nblood and carry off the bodies after<br />\nthe mortal combat. At first cream<br />\npuffs at twenty paces was suggested,<br />\nbut as this was an affair of state,<br />\nthis means was deemed insufficient.<br />\nThe challenge was made orally within the solid walls of Remsen Hall,<br />\nbut in order to save the concrete and<br />\nbrick structure and save the janitor some work, it was decided that<br />\nthe bout should be in back of the<br />\nhall on solid ground.<br />\nWitnesses assembled rapidly, and<br />\nat the sound of the clock in Gilman<br />\nHall, the champions entered the<br />\narena with blood in their eyes.<br />\nCheers shook the ground as they approached each other in preparation<br />\nfor the initial blow was to start the<br />\nbattle of the centuries.

Yudkin<br />\n<br />\nCHEMISTRY AND FURNISHINGS<br />\n<br />\nTo Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nCenturies ago when science was<br />\na field of mystery, the chemistry<br />\nlaboratory was the essence of all<br />\nthat was magic and evil. The term<br />\nbrought with it the picture of a<br />\nsmall, . gloomy chamber, meagerly<br />\nfurnished, seeking with innumerable cobwebs, curiously shaped vessels, potent powders, phials, and<br />\nmagic spells. Barely outlined against<br />\nthe dark shadows an emaciated,<br />\nstoopshouldered old man potters<br />\namong his unholy implements.<br />\nFrom his eyes shines the cruel unearthly look of a madman. He is always at work devising new and better means for his devilish practices.<br />\nDevelopment and education has<br />\ngradually altered the picture. We<br />\nthink now of a laboratory as a clean,<br />\nwell ventilated, spacious room<br />\nwhere white clad bright looking<br />\nyoung men are continually cleaning<br />\ntest-tubes and doing Other difficult<br />\ntasks for the advancement of science, the uplift of society and big<br />\nbusiness.

For three<br />\nsolid hours he must chafe his corns<br />\nand bunions\u2014sometimes only to<br />\nwatch something filter or boil for<br />\ntwo hours. He must disentangle and<br />\nput to memory innumerable formullas and reactions. He must set<br />\nup intricate apparatus. He must<br />\nremember countless materials.

Relief is<br />\ndefinitely promised, however, not by<br />\nthe weather man but by the library<br />\nauthorities. The relief takes the<br />\nform not of more seasonable weather\u2014for even library officials can't<br />\narrange that\u2014but of suitable drapery for the naked loveliness of the<br />\nrecently decorated windows. The<br />\nexact nature of the drapes and the<br />\ntime of their arrival have not been<br />\ndisclosed.<br />\nAnother library feature that has<br />\ncaused much and varied comment<br />\non the campus during the past week<br />\nis the dismantling of the opaque<br />\nglass partitions that have long individualized the tables in the main<br />\nreading room. They were removed<br />\nto permit shifting of the tables for<br />\nthe reception and exhibition on<br />\nCommemoration Day, and it has<br />\nbeen decided that they shall remain<br />\noff. With the glass slabs go the<br />\nlittle ledges, or arm-rests, that ran<br />\nalong the bottom of the glass in the<br />\nplane with the table tops. The<br />\nnatural result is that the room<br />\nSeems more open and spacious, and<br />\nless long and narrow than the<br />\nlongitudinal partitions made it appear formerly.<br />\nThe library staff seem to think<br />\nthe change is an improvement, but<br />\nit is far otherwise with the students. Some object to it on aesthetic<br />\ngrounds, others for purely practical<br />\nconsiderations. Nor is there unanimity in disapproving the attraction. Some have expressed themselves in favor of the new order.<br />\nAesthetic reasons, incidentally, are<br />\nadvanced in behalf of the change.

The early part of the<br />\nweek was witness to a rare game of<br />\nmarbles within the precints of the<br />\nsacred court by several more learned of the inmates, namely a Sophomore and Junior. The fascinating<br />\namusement was in progress with<br />\ngolf balls as marbles, but after several perforations of various and<br />\nsundry windows, the sport was<br />\nswitched to the game of golf itself.<br />\nA two-hole course was rapidly constructed in the midst of the lawn<br />\nequipped with all the necessary obstacles as bunkers and traps, the<br />\nformer being furnished by odd bits<br />\nof clothing, while the latter was furnished by a few holes deftly scooped in the turf. Needless to say, the<br />\nwhole course was entirely fairway,<br />\nno out-of-bound limits were established unless the ball chanced to<br />\nwander within the environs of Gilman Hall. At present a horse-shoe<br />\nrange, or whatever the correct<br />\ncognomen maybe, is being organized<br />\nand all contributions for horseshoes will be gladly and graciously<br />\nreceived by any of the students in<br />\nthe hall.<br />\nRecently, in order to hold the<br />\ndignity of the stately hall, one of<br />\nthe Dorm representatives, .suffering from the stimulating effects of<br />\nspring fever, challenged the victim,<br />\nhis chief grudge of the moment to<br />\nmortal combat on the field of honor.<br />\nA referee was selected, and seconds<br />\nappointed to mop up the pools of<br />\nblood and carry off the bodies after<br />\nthe mortal combat.

The term<br />\nbrought with it the picture of a<br />\nsmall, . gloomy chamber, meagerly<br />\nfurnished, seeking with innumerable cobwebs, curiously shaped vessels, potent powders, phials, and<br />\nmagic spells. Barely outlined against<br />\nthe dark shadows an emaciated,<br />\nstoopshouldered old man potters<br />\namong his unholy implements.<br />\nFrom his eyes shines the cruel unearthly look of a madman.

Relief is<br />\ndefinitely promised, however, not by<br />\nthe weather man but by the library<br />\nauthorities. The relief takes the<br />\nform not of more seasonable weather\u2014for even library officials can't<br />\narrange that\u2014but of suitable drapery for the naked loveliness of the<br />\nrecently decorated windows. The<br />\nexact nature of the drapes and the<br />\ntime of their arrival have not been<br />\ndisclosed.<br />\nAnother library feature that has<br />\ncaused much and varied comment<br />\non the campus during the past week<br />\nis the dismantling of the opaque<br />\nglass partitions that have long individualized the tables in the main<br />\nreading room. They were removed<br />\nto permit shifting of the tables for<br />\nthe reception and exhibition on<br />\nCommemoration Day, and it has<br />\nbeen decided that they shall remain<br />\noff. With the glass slabs go the<br />\nlittle ledges, or arm-rests, that ran<br />\nalong the bottom of the glass in the<br />\nplane with the table tops. The<br />\nnatural result is that the room<br />\nSeems more open and spacious, and<br />\nless long and narrow than the<br />\nlongitudinal partitions made it appear formerly.<br />\nThe library staff seem to think<br />\nthe change is an improvement, but<br />\nit is far otherwise with the students.
