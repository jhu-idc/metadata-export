It seems an<br />\nalmost complete reversal of an earlier stand, for, when<br />\nthe gambling controversy broke into the open shortly<br />\nbefore semester exams, the DSRC seemed firmly resolved<br />\nto the hope that the problem would work itself out with<br />\nthe help of semester grades, publicity and the meeting<br />\nthe Deans were to have with the gamblers. The first two<br />\nhad little or no effect on the gamblers. The last strangely<br />\nhad not occurred before the DSRC met Monday.<br />\nThe only indication of the resultant legislation came<br />\nwith formation of a committee composed of the various<br />\ndivergent factions on the Council. But formation of committees is a popular device of student organizations. And<br />\nconception is usually the extent of their achievement.<br />\nThis committee, however, returned to the Council<br />\nwith an unexpected recommendation\u2014a ban on gambling<br />\nthroughout the dormitories. This was quite a good deal<br />\nmore than President Leo Tonkin's demand last month<br />\nfor a mere statement of policy. It is more than the Council finally ratified.<br />\nWhy this shift? None of the committee members<br />\nspelled out their reasons in the same way. They ranged<br />\nfrom a desire to achieve a \"general norm of dorm behavior\" to a feeling that passing the buck would not be<br />\ntolerated by the administration, which might then reclaim some of the DSRCs autonomy.<br />\nWhatever the stated reasons, the action certainly<br />\nwasn't hasty. It seems a conscientious desire on the part of<br />\nthe dorm representatives to enhance the general welfare of<br />\nthe community by relieving a public gathering place (the<br />\nsnack bar) of the ogre of gambling. There can be no<br />\ndoubt that a representative group can legislate for such<br />\npurposes. But it is impossible to legislate customs. And<br />\nin the final analysis the extent of the protection offered<br />\nby the resolution and the extent to which gambling will<br />\nbe curtailed will depend on the wishes of individual<br />\ndorm inhabitants. If they want to gamble, they will find<br />\na way to do it\u2014either evading the snack bar restrictions<br />\nby playing for \"togetherness and then paying off togetherness,\" or by moving games to lounges or rooms, where,<br />\nunlike the snack bar, noise will become a disturbing factor.<br />\nThis resolution's success depends on the scope and<br />\neffect of its enforcement. It fails if it obliterates all cardplaying, for suspicion is rarely far from conviction, as<br />\nwas seen earlier in this gambling case, when the gamblers<br />\nwere placed under an onus of suspicion of destruction<br />\nand theft simply on grounds that they had the motive to<br />\ncommit these violations.<br />\nIf this resolution merely drives the gambling to<br />\nplaces where it can have a greater disturbing effect on<br />\nthe dormitories, it also fails. ,<br />\n<br />\nBy Intuition?<br />\nNow we ask you,. how the hell does anybody know<br />\nsomething unless he had been told it or reads it?

It seems an<br />\nalmost complete reversal of an earlier stand, for, when<br />\nthe gambling controversy broke into the open shortly<br />\nbefore semester exams, the DSRC seemed firmly resolved<br />\nto the hope that the problem would work itself out with<br />\nthe help of semester grades, publicity and the meeting<br />\nthe Deans were to have with the gamblers. The first two<br />\nhad little or no effect on the gamblers. The last strangely<br />\nhad not occurred before the DSRC met Monday.<br />\nThe only indication of the resultant legislation came<br />\nwith formation of a committee composed of the various<br />\ndivergent factions on the Council. But formation of committees is a popular device of student organizations. And<br />\nconception is usually the extent of their achievement.<br />\nThis committee, however, returned to the Council<br />\nwith an unexpected recommendation\u2014a ban on gambling<br />\nthroughout the dormitories. This was quite a good deal<br />\nmore than President Leo Tonkin's demand last month<br />\nfor a mere statement of policy. It is more than the Council finally ratified.<br />\nWhy this shift? None of the committee members<br />\nspelled out their reasons in the same way. They ranged<br />\nfrom a desire to achieve a \"general norm of dorm behavior\" to a feeling that passing the buck would not be<br />\ntolerated by the administration, which might then reclaim some of the DSRCs autonomy.<br />\nWhatever the stated reasons, the action certainly<br />\nwasn't hasty. It seems a conscientious desire on the part of<br />\nthe dorm representatives to enhance the general welfare of<br />\nthe community by relieving a public gathering place (the<br />\nsnack bar) of the ogre of gambling. There can be no<br />\ndoubt that a representative group can legislate for such<br />\npurposes. But it is impossible to legislate customs. And<br />\nin the final analysis the extent of the protection offered<br />\nby the resolution and the extent to which gambling will<br />\nbe curtailed will depend on the wishes of individual<br />\ndorm inhabitants. If they want to gamble, they will find<br />\na way to do it\u2014either evading the snack bar restrictions<br />\nby playing for \"togetherness and then paying off togetherness,\" or by moving games to lounges or rooms, where,<br />\nunlike the snack bar, noise will become a disturbing factor.<br />\nThis resolution's success depends on the scope and<br />\neffect of its enforcement. It fails if it obliterates all cardplaying, for suspicion is rarely far from conviction, as<br />\nwas seen earlier in this gambling case, when the gamblers<br />\nwere placed under an onus of suspicion of destruction<br />\nand theft simply on grounds that they had the motive to<br />\ncommit these violations.<br />\nIf this resolution merely drives the gambling to<br />\nplaces where it can have a greater disturbing effect on<br />\nthe dormitories, it also fails. ,<br /><br />\nBy Intuition?<br />\nNow we ask you,. how the hell does anybody know<br />\nsomething unless he had been told it or reads it?
