Primitive medicine develops into and alongside of<br />\nmodern medicine. The primitive<br />\nelement sometimes fags behind,<br />\nsometimes is ahead, but is always present in aii.y case; he asserted.<br />\nEvil Eye Still Feared<br />\nDr. Oliver told of the primitives who began making charms<br />\nand creating rituals to drive off<br />\nthe demons of disease. They believed that the demons or devils<br />\ncould be frightened away, so to<br />\nspeak, by different colors, magic<br />\nwords and the religious ceremo~ies or rituals practiced by the<br />\nexorcisors. The evil eye is still<br />\nfeared in our own times among<br />\nthe Italians and Chinese, and<br />\neven in the United States.<br />\nThe primitive doctor judged<br />\nthe case of his patient, at first, by<br />\nthe omens that were manifested<br />\nto him on his way to the home<br />\nof the patient. Later he considered as omens the appearance of<br />\nthe patient, his skin warmth or<br />\ncolor. Finally this developed into<br />\nthe \"symptoms\" recognized in<br />\nscientific medicine today.<br />\nAncient History Included<br />\nDr. Oliver gave as a side line<br />\na little history of the Asyria\u00b7Babylonian Empire, which he<br />\nfollowed with examples of the<br />\nadvancements in medicine at the<br />\ntime, especially when the priests<br />\nof the empire began to drive the<br />\ndemons out of the afflicted area<br />\nby force rather than by incantation. That was a big step toward<br />\nmodern surgery.<br />\nAs a conclusion to the lecture<br />\nDr. Oliver, showed some slides of<br />\ncuneform writings and pictures<br />\nrelative to ancient medicine.<br />\n<br />\n1,<br />\n<br />\nCol. 6.)<br />\n<br />\nend, who had fallen in his dash for<br />\nthe pass.

Primitive medicine develops into and alongside of<br />\nmodern medicine. The primitive<br />\nelement sometimes fags behind,<br />\nsometimes is ahead, but is always present in aii.y case; he asserted.<br />\nEvil Eye Still Feared<br />\nDr. Oliver told of the primitives who began making charms<br />\nand creating rituals to drive off<br />\nthe demons of disease. They believed that the demons or devils<br />\ncould be frightened away, so to<br />\nspeak, by different colors, magic<br />\nwords and the religious ceremo~ies or rituals practiced by the<br />\nexorcisors. The evil eye is still<br />\nfeared in our own times among<br />\nthe Italians and Chinese, and<br />\neven in the United States.<br />\nThe primitive doctor judged<br />\nthe case of his patient, at first, by<br />\nthe omens that were manifested<br />\nto him on his way to the home<br />\nof the patient. Later he considered as omens the appearance of<br />\nthe patient, his skin warmth or<br />\ncolor. Finally this developed into<br />\nthe \"symptoms\" recognized in<br />\nscientific medicine today.<br />\nAncient History Included<br />\nDr. Oliver gave as a side line<br />\na little history of the Asyria\u00b7Babylonian Empire, which he<br />\nfollowed with examples of the<br />\nadvancements in medicine at the<br />\ntime, especially when the priests<br />\nof the empire began to drive the<br />\ndemons out of the afflicted area<br />\nby force rather than by incantation.
