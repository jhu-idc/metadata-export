Mitch Clarvit, plans to<br />\nmake extensive use of various<br />\nBaltimore media in exchange for<br />\nuse of Hopkins campus and<br />\nfacilites as a stage of original area<br />\nmusicians.<br />\nThis year's ten-concert<br />\nProgram will include the<br />\ntraditional Hopkins groups along<br />\nWith representative<br />\nnon-university groups. The style<br />\nof music will range from<br />\nbluegrass and folk to, rock and<br />\njazz. All concerts will be held at<br />\nvarious locations on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus.<br />\n\"Flying Monkee was conceivedWith the idea that the best music<br />\nin Baltimore is made by Hopkins<br />\nbands,\" stated Clarvit about the<br />\n<br />\nseries.<br />\n\"We also want to provide this<br />\nyear an outlet for Baltimore<br />\nbands to express original ideas<br />\nwhile at the same time receiving<br />\nrecognition from city-wide<br />\naudiences and agencies. Everyone<br />\nbenefits from a situation like<br />\nthis,\" he continued.<br />\nPlans for an extensive<br />\nexposure of the series include<br />\nadvertisement by means of<br />\nvarious city and campus<br />\nnewspapers, along with audio<br />\ncoverage of the concerts by a<br />\nlocal progressive radio station.<br />\nSponsorship of the program<br />\nhas passed this year from last<br />\nyear's Junior class, founders of<br />\nthe series, to the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nLast year's Series performers<br />\nfrom Hopkins returning to<br />\ncampus for this year's program<br />\niriclude Ocean Rose,<br />\nPerman-Clarvit, and Gasque and<br />\n<br />\nDr. Christopher J. Shinkman<br />\n<br />\nseparate women's colleges are<br />\nthree factors: First, only a<br />\nuniquely women's college can<br />\noffer programs best-suited for the<br />\ndevelopment of women.<br />\nSecondly, the women's college<br />\nprovides an intellectual climate<br />\ntailored to the unique female<br />\ncharacter. Finally, the alternative<br />\nof a women's college should be<br />\nopen to all who seek it.<br />\nSexual Mixing<br />\nThere is a strong case for<br />\ncoeducational institutions as<br />\nwell, Dorsey noted. First, the<br />\ncoeducational institution<br />\nprovides a more life-like<br />\nenvironment, second, more<br />\ndiversity is intrinsic to the<br />\nacademic programs of a<br />\ncoeducational university, thirdly,<br />\nsexual mixing naturally promotes<br />\ngreater unity, and finally and<br />\nperhaps the most practical, is<br />\nthat a coeducational institution<br />\nattracts a wider spectrum of<br />\nfaculty and more finances.<br />\nFuture<br />\nThe future of women's<br />\ncolleges, according to Dorsey,<br />\nwill rest with individual<br />\ninstitutions being able to \"serve a<br />\ndistinct need for a wider group<br />\nthan they did before,\" by<br />\nexpanding programs to include<br />\nwomen who have been<br />\nacademically dormant for a few<br />\nyears, e.g. young housewives.<br />\nWhen questioned as to the<br />\ngeneral future of the private<br />\nwoman's college, Dorsey replied<br />\n\"Do I think there will be a<br />\ncontinued demand for women's<br />\ncolleges? Yes!\"<br />\n<br />\nBrunicandi.

Smith pointed out last<br />\nnight on ABC television, when you start firing the good<br />\nguys, something has gone massively wrong. The Nixon<br />\norder instructing Cox to cease further efforts to obtain the<br />\nWatergate tapes appears to be the desparate act of a guilty<br />\nman.<br />\nTo suggest that the President has the right to the<br />\npresu mption of innocence is ludicrous at this point. First,<br />\nwith Presidential power and Congressional lethargy as<br />\nextensive as they are today, Nixon could destroy the very<br />\nstructure of the Constitutional system while insisting on the<br />\npresumption of his own innocence. Second, if he is<br />\ninnocent, it may be asked, why does he exhibit such<br />\ncontempt for the American system of justice?<br />\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution is quite<br />\nexplicit on the subject of impeachment. What remains to be<br />\nseen is whether or not the Congress of the United States<br />\nhas the courage to cast aside its tendency to avoid conflict,<br />\nand seriously consider the matter of impeachment. While a<br />\nredsolution for impeachment of the President is certainly a<br />\nserious matter, and its introduction in Congress will surely<br />\ncause conflict and trepidation there the American political<br />\nsystem is in jeopardy, and the Congress ought to use its<br />\ncapacity to remove the President.<br />\n<br />\n\"The President, the Vice President and all civil officers of<br />\nthe United States shall be removed from office on<br />\nimpeachment for, and conviction of treason, bribery or<br />\nother high crimes and misdemeanors.\" \u2014 (Article If, Sectiou<br />\n4.)<br />\n\"the House of Representatives\u2014shall have the sole power<br />\nofirnpeachment.\" \u2014 (Article 1, Section 2.)<br />\n\"The Senate shall have the sole power to try all<br />\nimpeachments.

And because I left<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\npass fail pass fail<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nI wish to commend the.CUS on<br />\ntheir recent display of intestinal<br />\nfortitude in academic policies,<br />\nespecially concerning the<br />\nFreshman Pass/Fail Semester. In<br />\ncharacteristic fashion, the CUS has<br />\nde fended the right of the<br />\nFreshman to a semester of<br />\nPass/Fail\u2014that is, until earlier this<br />\nmonth, when it was modified to<br />\nappease several graduate schools,<br />\ni.e. law and medical schools. From<br />\nthis action two important points<br />\nseem to arise: 1) that when the<br />\noriginal policy of a P/F semester<br />\nwas adopted, it would have seemed<br />\nobvious to thinking persons<br />\n(evidently not to the CUS)to take<br />\ninto consideration future conflicts<br />\nwith graduate schools and to<br />\ndecide at that time to either<br />\nmaintain the P/F semester in spite<br />\nof any requests from schools or to<br />\nnever implement the system, and<br />\n2) that the recent change seem to<br />\naffect those students who were<br />\npreviously assured that nothing<br />\ncould cause revelation to other<br />\n<br />\ngovernment of laws. \"No point is<br />\nof more importance than the right<br />\nof impeachment should be<br />\ncontinued. Shall any man be above<br />\njustice? Above all, shall that man<br />\nbe above it who can committ the<br />\nmost extensive injustice?...Shall<br />\nthe man who has practiced<br />\ncorruption and by that means<br />\nprocured his own appointment in<br />\nthe first instance, be suffered to<br />\nescape punishment by repeating his<br />\nguilt?\"<br />\nMr. Madison: \"It is indispensible<br />\nthat some provision should be<br />\nmade for defending the<br />\nCommunity against the incapacity,<br />\nnegligence, or perfidy of the Chief<br />\nMagistrate [the President]. The<br />\nlimitation of the period of his<br />\nservice is not a sufficient security.<br />\nHe might lose his capacity after his<br />\nappointment [election]. He might<br />\npervert his administration into a<br />\n<br />\ninstitutions of their first semester<br />\ngrades (except freshman transfers<br />\nand 2-5 program). It would seem<br />\nthat the natural procedure would<br />\nhave been to make changes in the<br />\nsystem affecting next year's<br />\nfreshman class, and show some<br />\nintegrity by making good the<br />\npromises given to the classes of<br />\n'75,'76, and '77. As the case now<br />\nappears, the CUS has shown its<br />\nversi on of integrity by<br />\ncompromiSing and allowing the<br />\nstudent to make the choice, which<br />\nforces the student to reveal the<br />\ngrades since schools will now call<br />\nany unrevealed grades positive C's<br />\nand D's, whereas before they had<br />\nto admit they just didn't know<br />\nwhat the grades were. What all this<br />\nboils down to is that it seems that<br />\nthe policies of the venerable CUS<br />\nare binding, as long as there's no<br />\ncomplaints from outside sources.<br />\nShould any complaints arise,<br />\nhowever, it seems that the CUS<br />\ntakes-off running for the hills,<br />\nhoping to avoid any fights.<br />\nSam Hassenbusch<br />\n<br />\nmy radio at home, remembering<br />\nhalfway down the Jersey<br />\nturnpike, the prospects for me<br />\nand \"Angie\" don't look too<br />\ngood.<br />\n9/15\u2014.\u2014Plunge into the city.<br />\nThe album, released two days<br />\nbefore, is decorating the windows<br />\nof countless record shops. Goat's<br />\nHead Soup, Jagger's on the cover,<br />\nin a photo that kind of melts past<br />\nthe mustaidy yellow of the<br />\njacket. Of course Jagger is on the<br />\nfront, Richard on the back, while<br />\nWyman, Watts and Taylor are<br />\nrelatively obscure in the center of<br />\nthe jacket. But where is the goat<br />\nor the head and most of all, the<br />\nsoup? Patience. From inside the<br />\nalbum, comes the goat's head<br />\nsoup, the goat's eyes turned<br />\nupward to be sure.<br />\n9/28--Waiting agM. The<br />\nStones come on TV tonight for<br />\nthe first time in God knows how<br />\nlong, and it's a big deal across the<br />\ncountry.

And finding a TV is no<br />\n<br />\neasy task. Finally, the opening to<br />\n\"Angie\" is heard and Jagger<br />\nappears. The whole thing is<br />\ncanned, they tricked us, look at<br />\nRichard and Taylor faking the<br />\nriffs, while Jagger gets off on<br />\nchanging costumes and makeup<br />\nfor each song. Byt the time<br />\n\"Angie 2\" was played,<br />\ndisappointment had set in, the<br />\nwait was fruitless. Bag it, Mick.<br />\nGoat 's Head Soup: Uh, a<br />\nlogical progression. It will grow<br />\non you. Really hard to get into a<br />\nStones album immediately. And<br />\nthere are a few rockers. All good<br />\nrationalizations.

And who cares if<br />\nthey're coming down again, or<br />\nwhat they're corning down from.<br />\nSome songs are a bit drawn out,<br />\nbut once again the music is up to<br />\npar.

A bad<br />\none ought to be kept in fear of it. I<br />\nhope the maxim would never be<br />\nadopted here that the Chief<br />\nMagistrate could do not wrong.\"<br />\nShortly thereafter, according to<br />\nMadison's report, Gouverneur<br />\nMorris was persuaded by the<br />\ndebate that impeachment was<br />\nindeed a necessity, because \"Our<br />\nExec utive is not like a magistrate<br />\nhaving a life interest, much less one<br />\nhaving an hereditary interest in his<br />\noffice.\"<br />\nPrior to adjournment that<br />\nFriday in 1787, eight states voted<br />\nin favor of retaining the<br />\nimpeachment clause with the<br />\nlanguage \"malpractice or neglect of<br />\nduty\" as the criteria for supporting<br />\nan impeachment and conviction of<br />\nthe president. It may be a note of<br />\nhistorical irony that Massachusetts<br />\nvoted against it. But perhaps a<br />\ngreater irony lies in the<br />\ncircumstances surrounding the<br />\nchange in language from<br />\n\"malpractice or neglect of duty\"<br />\n<br />\nto \"Treason, Bribery, or other<br />\nHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"<br />\nJames Madison suggested refining<br />\nthe vague terms \"malpractice\" and<br />\n\"neglect of duty\", but it was<br />\nMadison too who advocated the<br />\noaclest<br />\n<br />\nco nst r.tc.tion<br />\n<br />\nof<br />\nir<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nwas<br />\n<br />\nMadison's belief that ',wanton<br />\n<br />\nremoval of meritous officers from<br />\no ffice\" by the President<br />\nconstituted \"maladministration\"<br />\nto such a degree as to make the<br />\nPresident liable to impeachment.<br />\nAt this moment in American<br />\nhistory, 1973, what James Madison<br />\nfolind to be \"within the compass<br />\nof probably events\" has<br />\nbecome<br />\nbloody reality. We have a<br />\nPresident<br />\nwho apparently spared \"no<br />\neffort<br />\nor means whatever\" to secure his<br />\nown re-election as Richardson<br />\nDavie had feared\u2014the<br />\nimpeachment clause<br />\nnotwithstanding.<br />\nTwo former cabinet members<br />\nand several former aides to the<br />\nPresident have been indicted on<br />\ncharges of abusing power they<br />\npossessed at the pleasure of the<br />\nPresident in the interest of<br />\nre-electing the President. Detailed<br />\naccusations against the President<br />\nhave been dismissed by the<br />\nPresident himself in a most<br />\nspeciously woven blanket of<br />\ndenials. The Vice President has<br />\nbeen exposed as a common<br />\ncrook\u2014a factor only amplifying<br />\ndistrust of the President's own<br />\ndenials. The President has refused<br />\nto surrender evidence to the<br />\ncourts, while simultaneously<br />\nproclaiming that adjudication of<br />\ncriminal behavior in his re-election<br />\ncampaign should be left in the<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nhands of the judicial branch.

If<br />\nMr. Nixon honestly believes in the<br />\nseparation of powers, why has he<br />\ndeemed it necessary to prohibit the<br />\nSupreme Court from hearing the<br />\ntapes case?

The game was<br />\nextremely important for both<br />\nteams for a win would assure<br />\neither a spot in the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference title race; a<br />\ntie would eliminate the<br />\nDiplomats altogether while the<br />\nJays would still be in the<br />\nrunning; and a loss would pretty<br />\nmuch eliminate both from title<br />\ncontention.<br />\nUnder a beautiful sky with<br />\nvery strong winds, the Jays found<br />\ntheir competition to be<br />\ntwo-sided: on one side was the<br />\nDiplomat team while on the<br />\nother were the Pennsylvania<br />\nreferees.<br />\nAt times the Jays weren't sure<br />\nwhich of the competitions were<br />\ngreater. The poor officiating hurt<br />\nthe Jays on an unusually large<br />\nnumber of occasions while the<br />\nDiplomats frustrated the Jays by<br />\ntaking fewer shots than the<br />\nHopkins team (17-22) but still<br />\nshutting them out.<br />\n\"Rather than getting<br />\nprogressively<br />\nbetter or<br />\nprogressively worse as should be<br />\nthe case as a season continues, we<br />\nseem to have reverted back to a<br />\nlot of our had habits,\" claimed<br />\nsoccer coach Robert Oliver. \"The<br />\noffense just wasn't there.

A \"let someone<br />\nelse do it\" attitude appears in the<br />\noffensive side of the field.<br />\n\"There was no fire,\" remarks<br />\nOliver, \"we just don't have any<br />\n'finishers' on the team.\"<br />\nThe strong winds accounted<br />\nfor a number of misjudged balls.<br />\nThe Diplomats put together a<br />\nfast break that placed them on<br />\nthe scoreboard first after 30<br />\ngoalless minutes in the first half.<br />\nA minute and a half later, the<br />\nDiplomats scored a second time<br />\nafter a crossed ball was deflected<br />\naway from the nets by Hopkins<br />\n<br />\ngoalie Jack Bukowski but found<br />\nits way to the foot of another<br />\nDiplomat who popped it into the<br />\ngoal.<br />\nThe Jays have yet this season<br />\nto play \"catch up\" ball. With<br />\ntwenty minutes gone in the<br />\nsecond half, F & M scored a third<br />\ntime as Bukowski's attempt to<br />\nblock a kick from twenty yards<br />\nout left him grounded, allowing<br />\nthe ball to go untouched into the<br />\nnet.<br />\nWith four games left, three of<br />\nwhich are conference games, the<br />\nJays' hopes for the MAC title are<br />\nslim. However, they can still<br />\nplace high in the conference as<br />\n<br />\ntheir major role for the<br />\nremainder of their season will be<br />\nthat of a \"spoiler\". Two of those<br />\nlast three conference opponents,<br />\nWashington College and Western<br />\nMaryland, are still very much in<br />\ncontention for the title. In<br />\ndefeating these teams in the<br />\ncoming weeks, the Blue Jays can<br />\nthen \"spoil\" these teams chances<br />\nfor a title and at the same time<br />\nincrease Hopkins' chanc,..3 for a<br />\nthird, or possible a second place<br />\nfinish in the MAC.<br />\nRecord<br />\nThe booters will have to get<br />\ntogether and decide among<br />\n<br />\nthemselves whether their last<br />\nfour games will be their finishing<br />\nglory. With their present 44-1<br />\nrecord, four more Hopkins wins<br />\nwould certainly be impressive<br />\nand would at least describe the<br />\nBlue Jays season's efforts.<br />\nAnything less wold not serve<br />\ntheir true abilities justice.<br />\nJays vs. UMBC<br />\nThe Jays will have a full<br />\nuninterrupted week of practice<br />\nbefore this Saturday's game with<br />\nUMBC. That should give the<br />\nteam lots of time to put together<br />\nwhat it's going to take to have a<br />\nwinning season.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins harriers drop both ends of tri-meet<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nThe Hopkins cross-country<br />\nteam suffered its worst set-back<br />\nof the season Saturday, dropping<br />\nboth ends of their trimeet to<br />\nFranklin & Marshall 25-30 and<br />\nLebanon Valley, 27-31, at the<br />\nwoody Lebanon Valley course.<br />\nNot all the harriers had off<br />\ndays, however.

The other Hopkins<br />\nfinishers included junior Bill<br />\nSchickler, and senior captain<br />\nAustin Doyle.<br />\nThe top five spread for<br />\nHopkins was not all that bad at<br />\n2:32, but both opponents had<br />\ndisciplined packs which held<br />\ntheir spreads well within two<br />\nminutes. If the Blue Jays can<br />\nbring that spread down a minute<br />\nthey definitely will be a force to<br />\nbe reckoned with in the<br />\nchampionship meets.<br />\nBecause of the early two miles<br />\nof running in the woods, the<br />\n<br />\nharriers needed to go out at a fast<br />\npace in the first part of the race.<br />\nGreve and Kennedy did this,<br />\nwhile the others simply did not<br />\nand were stuck behind slower<br />\nrunners until the race pattern was<br />\ntoo well established.<br />\nThe team hopes to recover<br />\ntheir early season confidence in<br />\n<br />\nthe two remaining dual meets.<br />\nThey travel to Washington<br />\nCollege Thursday, and finally<br />\nreturn home against Swarthmore<br />\non October 31, following five<br />\naway meets in a row.

Finally, the alternative<br />\nof a women's college should be<br />\nopen to all who seek it.<br />\nSexual Mixing<br />\nThere is a strong case for<br />\ncoeducational institutions as<br />\nwell, Dorsey noted. First, the<br />\ncoeducational institution<br />\nprovides a more life-like<br />\nenvironment, second, more<br />\ndiversity is intrinsic to the<br />\nacademic programs of a<br />\ncoeducational university, thirdly,<br />\nsexual mixing naturally promotes<br />\ngreater unity, and finally and<br />\nperhaps the most practical, is<br />\nthat a coeducational institution<br />\nattracts a wider spectrum of<br />\nfaculty and more finances.<br />\nFuture<br />\nThe future of women's<br />\ncolleges, according to Dorsey,<br />\nwill rest with individual<br />\ninstitutions being able to \"serve a<br />\ndistinct need for a wider group<br />\nthan they did before,\" by<br />\nexpanding programs to include<br />\nwomen who have been<br />\nacademically dormant for a few<br />\nyears, e.g. young housewives.<br />\nWhen questioned as to the<br />\ngeneral future of the private<br />\nwoman's college, Dorsey replied<br />\n\"Do I think there will be a<br />\ncontinued demand for women's<br />\ncolleges?

Smith pointed out last<br />\nnight on ABC television, when you start firing the good<br />\nguys, something has gone massively wrong. The Nixon<br />\norder instructing Cox to cease further efforts to obtain the<br />\nWatergate tapes appears to be the desparate act of a guilty<br />\nman.<br />\nTo suggest that the President has the right to the<br />\npresu mption of innocence is ludicrous at this point. First,<br />\nwith Presidential power and Congressional lethargy as<br />\nextensive as they are today, Nixon could destroy the very<br />\nstructure of the Constitutional system while insisting on the<br />\npresumption of his own innocence. Second, if he is<br />\ninnocent, it may be asked, why does he exhibit such<br />\ncontempt for the American system of justice?<br />\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution is quite<br />\nexplicit on the subject of impeachment. What remains to be<br />\nseen is whether or not the Congress of the United States<br />\nhas the courage to cast aside its tendency to avoid conflict,<br />\nand seriously consider the matter of impeachment. While a<br />\nredsolution for impeachment of the President is certainly a<br />\nserious matter, and its introduction in Congress will surely<br />\ncause conflict and trepidation there the American political<br />\nsystem is in jeopardy, and the Congress ought to use its<br />\ncapacity to remove the President.<br /><br />\n\"The President, the Vice President and all civil officers of<br />\nthe United States shall be removed from office on<br />\nimpeachment for, and conviction of treason, bribery or<br />\nother high crimes and misdemeanors.\" \u2014 (Article If, Sectiou<br />\n4.)<br />\n\"the House of Representatives\u2014shall have the sole power<br />\nofirnpeachment.\" \u2014 (Article 1, Section 2.)<br />\n\"The Senate shall have the sole power to try all<br />\nimpeachments.

And because I left<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\npass fail pass fail<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nI wish to commend the.CUS on<br />\ntheir recent display of intestinal<br />\nfortitude in academic policies,<br />\nespecially concerning the<br />\nFreshman Pass/Fail Semester. In<br />\ncharacteristic fashion, the CUS has<br />\nde fended the right of the<br />\nFreshman to a semester of<br />\nPass/Fail\u2014that is, until earlier this<br />\nmonth, when it was modified to<br />\nappease several graduate schools,<br />\ni.e. law and medical schools. From<br />\nthis action two important points<br />\nseem to arise: 1) that when the<br />\noriginal policy of a P/F semester<br />\nwas adopted, it would have seemed<br />\nobvious to thinking persons<br />\n(evidently not to the CUS)to take<br />\ninto consideration future conflicts<br />\nwith graduate schools and to<br />\ndecide at that time to either<br />\nmaintain the P/F semester in spite<br />\nof any requests from schools or to<br />\nnever implement the system, and<br />\n2) that the recent change seem to<br />\naffect those students who were<br />\npreviously assured that nothing<br />\ncould cause revelation to other<br /><br />\ngovernment of laws. \"No point is<br />\nof more importance than the right<br />\nof impeachment should be<br />\ncontinued. Shall any man be above<br />\njustice? Above all, shall that man<br />\nbe above it who can committ the<br />\nmost extensive injustice?...Shall<br />\nthe man who has practiced<br />\ncorruption and by that means<br />\nprocured his own appointment in<br />\nthe first instance, be suffered to<br />\nescape punishment by repeating his<br />\nguilt?\"<br />\nMr. Madison: \"It is indispensible<br />\nthat some provision should be<br />\nmade for defending the<br />\nCommunity against the incapacity,<br />\nnegligence, or perfidy of the Chief<br />\nMagistrate [the President]. The<br />\nlimitation of the period of his<br />\nservice is not a sufficient security.<br />\nHe might lose his capacity after his<br />\nappointment [election]. He might<br />\npervert his administration into a<br /><br />\ninstitutions of their first semester<br />\ngrades (except freshman transfers<br />\nand 2-5 program). It would seem<br />\nthat the natural procedure would<br />\nhave been to make changes in the<br />\nsystem affecting next year's<br />\nfreshman class, and show some<br />\nintegrity by making good the<br />\npromises given to the classes of<br />\n'75,'76, and '77. As the case now<br />\nappears, the CUS has shown its<br />\nversi on of integrity by<br />\ncompromiSing and allowing the<br />\nstudent to make the choice, which<br />\nforces the student to reveal the<br />\ngrades since schools will now call<br />\nany unrevealed grades positive C's<br />\nand D's, whereas before they had<br />\nto admit they just didn't know<br />\nwhat the grades were. What all this<br />\nboils down to is that it seems that<br />\nthe policies of the venerable CUS<br />\nare binding, as long as there's no<br />\ncomplaints from outside sources.<br />\nShould any complaints arise,<br />\nhowever, it seems that the CUS<br />\ntakes-off running for the hills,<br />\nhoping to avoid any fights.<br />\nSam Hassenbusch<br /><br />\nmy radio at home, remembering<br />\nhalfway down the Jersey<br />\nturnpike, the prospects for me<br />\nand \"Angie\" don't look too<br />\ngood.<br />\n9/15\u2014.\u2014Plunge into the city.<br />\nThe album, released two days<br />\nbefore, is decorating the windows<br />\nof countless record shops.

It may be a note of<br />\nhistorical irony that Massachusetts<br />\nvoted against it. But perhaps a<br />\ngreater irony lies in the<br />\ncircumstances surrounding the<br />\nchange in language from<br />\n\"malpractice or neglect of duty\"<br /><br />\nto \"Treason, Bribery, or other<br />\nHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"<br />\nJames Madison suggested refining<br />\nthe vague terms \"malpractice\" and<br />\n\"neglect of duty\", but it was<br />\nMadison too who advocated the<br />\noaclest<br /><br />\nco nst r.tc.tion<br /><br />\nof<br />\nir<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nwas<br /><br />\nMadison's belief that ',wanton<br /><br />\nremoval of meritous officers from<br />\no ffice\" by the President<br />\nconstituted \"maladministration\"<br />\nto such a degree as to make the<br />\nPresident liable to impeachment.<br />\nAt this moment in American<br />\nhistory, 1973, what James Madison<br />\nfolind to be \"within the compass<br />\nof probably events\" has<br />\nbecome<br />\nbloody reality.

Detailed<br />\naccusations against the President<br />\nhave been dismissed by the<br />\nPresident himself in a most<br />\nspeciously woven blanket of<br />\ndenials. The Vice President has<br />\nbeen exposed as a common<br />\ncrook\u2014a factor only amplifying<br />\ndistrust of the President's own<br />\ndenials. The President has refused<br />\nto surrender evidence to the<br />\ncourts, while simultaneously<br />\nproclaiming that adjudication of<br />\ncriminal behavior in his re-election<br />\ncampaign should be left in the<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nhands of the judicial branch.

The game was<br />\nextremely important for both<br />\nteams for a win would assure<br />\neither a spot in the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference title race; a<br />\ntie would eliminate the<br />\nDiplomats altogether while the<br />\nJays would still be in the<br />\nrunning; and a loss would pretty<br />\nmuch eliminate both from title<br />\ncontention.<br />\nUnder a beautiful sky with<br />\nvery strong winds, the Jays found<br />\ntheir competition to be<br />\ntwo-sided: on one side was the<br />\nDiplomat team while on the<br />\nother were the Pennsylvania<br />\nreferees.<br />\nAt times the Jays weren't sure<br />\nwhich of the competitions were<br />\ngreater. The poor officiating hurt<br />\nthe Jays on an unusually large<br />\nnumber of occasions while the<br />\nDiplomats frustrated the Jays by<br />\ntaking fewer shots than the<br />\nHopkins team (17-22) but still<br />\nshutting them out.<br />\n\"Rather than getting<br />\nprogressively<br />\nbetter or<br />\nprogressively worse as should be<br />\nthe case as a season continues, we<br />\nseem to have reverted back to a<br />\nlot of our had habits,\" claimed<br />\nsoccer coach Robert Oliver. \"The<br />\noffense just wasn't there. It was<br />\nas if they took a holiday.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays can move the<br />\nball excellently for seventy or<br /><br />\neighty yards, but it's that last<br />\ntwenty or thirty yards where<br />\nthey fall apart. A \"let someone<br />\nelse do it\" attitude appears in the<br />\noffensive side of the field.<br />\n\"There was no fire,\" remarks<br />\nOliver, \"we just don't have any<br />\n'finishers' on the team.\"<br />\nThe strong winds accounted<br />\nfor a number of misjudged balls.<br />\nThe Diplomats put together a<br />\nfast break that placed them on<br />\nthe scoreboard first after 30<br />\ngoalless minutes in the first half.<br />\nA minute and a half later, the<br />\nDiplomats scored a second time<br />\nafter a crossed ball was deflected<br />\naway from the nets by Hopkins<br /><br />\ngoalie Jack Bukowski but found<br />\nits way to the foot of another<br />\nDiplomat who popped it into the<br />\ngoal.<br />\nThe Jays have yet this season<br />\nto play \"catch up\" ball. With<br />\ntwenty minutes gone in the<br />\nsecond half, F &amp; M scored a third<br />\ntime as Bukowski's attempt to<br />\nblock a kick from twenty yards<br />\nout left him grounded, allowing<br />\nthe ball to go untouched into the<br />\nnet.<br />\nWith four games left, three of<br />\nwhich are conference games, the<br />\nJays' hopes for the MAC title are<br />\nslim. However, they can still<br />\nplace high in the conference as<br /><br />\ntheir major role for the<br />\nremainder of their season will be<br />\nthat of a \"spoiler\". Two of those<br />\nlast three conference opponents,<br />\nWashington College and Western<br />\nMaryland, are still very much in<br />\ncontention for the title. In<br />\ndefeating these teams in the<br />\ncoming weeks, the Blue Jays can<br />\nthen \"spoil\" these teams chances<br />\nfor a title and at the same time<br />\nincrease Hopkins' chanc,..3 for a<br />\nthird, or possible a second place<br />\nfinish in the MAC.<br />\nRecord<br />\nThe booters will have to get<br />\ntogether and decide among<br /><br />\nthemselves whether their last<br />\nfour games will be their finishing<br />\nglory. With their present 44-1<br />\nrecord, four more Hopkins wins<br />\nwould certainly be impressive<br />\nand would at least describe the<br />\nBlue Jays season's efforts.<br />\nAnything less wold not serve<br />\ntheir true abilities justice.<br />\nJays vs. UMBC<br />\nThe Jays will have a full<br />\nuninterrupted week of practice<br />\nbefore this Saturday's game with<br />\nUMBC. That should give the<br />\nteam lots of time to put together<br />\nwhat it's going to take to have a<br />\nwinning season.<br /><br />\nHopkins harriers drop both ends of tri-meet<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nThe Hopkins cross-country<br />\nteam suffered its worst set-back<br />\nof the season Saturday, dropping<br />\nboth ends of their trimeet to<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall 25-30 and<br />\nLebanon Valley, 27-31, at the<br />\nwoody Lebanon Valley course.<br />\nNot all the harriers had off<br />\ndays, however. Jeff Greve won<br />\nthe race easily, establishing<br />\nhimself as a definite contender<br />\nfor the top spot at the MAC<br />\nchampionship in Philadelphia<br />\nnext month.<br />\nFreshman Jim Kennedy also<br />\nhad a fine day, taking 4th behind<br />\nGreve and the top runners from<br />\nLebanon Valley and Franklin &amp;<br />\nMarshall. Greve and Kennedy<br />\nshould be quite a duo in the post<br />\nseason meets.<br /><br />\nThe race was decided in the<br />\nnext three positions, where<br />\nHopkins lost all three match-ups<br />\nbadly. Junior John Tetzlaff<br />\nfinished 10th, junior Jon Higdon<br />\n14th, and freshman Randy Sailer<br />\n16th. The other Hopkins<br />\nfinishers included junior Bill<br />\nSchickler, and senior captain<br />\nAustin Doyle.<br />\nThe top five spread for<br />\nHopkins was not all that bad at<br />\n2:32, but both opponents had<br />\ndisciplined packs which held<br />\ntheir spreads well within two<br />\nminutes. If the Blue Jays can<br />\nbring that spread down a minute<br />\nthey definitely will be a force to<br />\nbe reckoned with in the<br />\nchampionship meets.<br />\nBecause of the early two miles<br />\nof running in the woods, the<br /><br />\nharriers needed to go out at a fast<br />\npace in the first part of the race.<br />\nGreve and Kennedy did this,<br />\nwhile the others simply did not<br />\nand were stuck behind slower<br />\nrunners until the race pattern was<br />\ntoo well established.<br />\nThe team hopes to recover<br />\ntheir early season confidence in<br /><br />\nthe two remaining dual meets.<br />\nThey travel to Washington<br />\nCollege Thursday, and finally<br />\nreturn home against Swarthmore<br />\non October 31, following five<br />\naway meets in a row.
