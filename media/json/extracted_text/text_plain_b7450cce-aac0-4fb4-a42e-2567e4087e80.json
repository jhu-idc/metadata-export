Last<br />\nyear the radio club was comfortably situated on the sixth<br />\nfloor of Ames. But their 1,000<br />\nwatts were not enthusiastically<br />\nreceived by members of the various physics labs. Recalling how<br />\nthey were ejected quite suddenly<br />\nfrom Maryland Hall for similar<br />\nreasons a few years ago, the club<br />\narranged with the Chemistry Department to occupy their present<br />\nquarters.<br />\nThe building itself is a little<br />\ngreen cement-block structure<br />\nbuilt about 1944 or 1945. An inventory of the place at present<br />\nwould uncover two beds, cables,<br />\nwire, assorted tools, and the<br />\ntransmitting apparatus: a large<br />\nconsole flanked by two receivers<br />\nand two transmitters.<br />\n<br />\nThe club members moved to<br />\nthe building this summer, repainted , the inside, and constructed a 71 foot tower in the<br />\nadjacent woods.<br />\nNew Tower<br />\nThe tower is quite an achievement. The construction of the<br />\nsteel lattice-work first required<br />\nthat several trees be removed<br />\nonly then could work proceed to<br />\npouring the concrete base. Capping this structure is a beam antenna, or. in ham language, a<br />\ntriband cubicle quad.<br />\nThe set is in almost full<br />\noperation. When transmitting,<br />\nW3GQF uses the maximum amateur power of 1,000 watts. The<br />\nstation is licensed to Dr. Ferdinand Hamburger, Jr., the advisor.<br />\n<br />\ntest runs for two months on<br />\nevery other weekend. The purpose is to contact as many other<br />\nham stations and as many of the<br />\nsections in the United States and<br />\nits possessions as one can. Last<br />\nyear the club worked all 73 sections and finished sixth in its<br />\nsection.<br />\nRussian Hams<br />\nRussian operators are extremely regimented.
