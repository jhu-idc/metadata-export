Judge!<br />\nFor an old Hopkin, Judge I. Sewell Lamdin seems<br />\nto have it in for his Alma Mater. When the time comes<br />\nfor that great Alumni Roll Call in the sky, we predict<br />\nthe good Judge will turn out the pockets of his fraying<br />\nrobes anti plead poverty. When one begins to speculate<br />\non what the \"1\" stands for, the first thing that comes to<br />\nmind is injustice.<br />\nIt is a very poor judge indeed who makes a judicial<br />\ndecision based on extra-judicial concerns. In a recent<br />\ntrial of the six Hopkins SIDS members arrested in an<br />\nanti-war demonstration, Judge Lamdin ruled that they<br />\nwere to be convicted on charges of disorderly conduct.<br />\nDisorderly conduct is defined in terms of obeying<br />\nor not obeying a police order. At the time of the arrest<br />\nthe demonstrators were sitting on the sidewalk and it<br />\nwas never determined whether the students had been<br />\naskd to leave. Instead of searching for a sound basis for<br />\ndecision Judge Lamdin sought refuge in statements like<br />\n\"You know nothing of war, all you have are misconceptions\". He clearly allowed personal political conviction<br />\nto interfere with his judgement of the case.<br />\nIn convicting a Hopkins student of a disorderly<br />\nconduct charge involving a parking violation some weeks<br />\nago (a decision that was later reversed) Lamdin said,<br />\n\"I don't know what's going on at Hopkins these days.<br />\nWhen I was up there, we never would have thought of<br />\ncalling a policeman an idiot; I just won't stand for it.\"<br />\nFor the Judge's benefit, here is what is happening<br />\nat Hopkins: While most of us would not think of calling a policeman an idiot (which, incidentally the student<br />\nin question never di(1), many of us are prepared to go<br />\nyou one better anti refer to a certain judicial bench<br />\nwarmer in the same terms.<br />\nUnfortunately, the conduct of some of the SDS<br />\nmembers did not enhance the strength of their case.<br />\nJudge Lamdin rightly convicted an SDS member for<br />\nscribbling obscenities on the wall of the Northern District Police Station. Such conduct is immature and not<br />\nin keeping with the sincere moral anti political convictions that motivated the protest.<br />\nSuch a universal loss of dignity and sensibility in a<br />\ncase of this kind is unfortunate, as the issues are quite<br />\nserious. While it would be libelous _to dismiss the whole<br />\nbunch, Judge and scribblers, as bastards, all you really<br />\nhave are misconceptions.<br />\n<br />\nFortune<br />\nIt means the'difference between going to school and<br />\nnot going to school.

It means the difference between a monumental intellectual and social growth for<br />\nsonic individual, some person who has the capacity, the<br />\nincentive, the moral right to seek knowledge, and the<br />\nloss of that monumental growth.

Judge!<br />\nFor an old Hopkin, Judge I. Sewell Lamdin seems<br />\nto have it in for his Alma Mater. When the time comes<br />\nfor that great Alumni Roll Call in the sky, we predict<br />\nthe good Judge will turn out the pockets of his fraying<br />\nrobes anti plead poverty. When one begins to speculate<br />\non what the \"1\" stands for, the first thing that comes to<br />\nmind is injustice.<br />\nIt is a very poor judge indeed who makes a judicial<br />\ndecision based on extra-judicial concerns. In a recent<br />\ntrial of the six Hopkins SIDS members arrested in an<br />\nanti-war demonstration, Judge Lamdin ruled that they<br />\nwere to be convicted on charges of disorderly conduct.<br />\nDisorderly conduct is defined in terms of obeying<br />\nor not obeying a police order. At the time of the arrest<br />\nthe demonstrators were sitting on the sidewalk and it<br />\nwas never determined whether the students had been<br />\naskd to leave. Instead of searching for a sound basis for<br />\ndecision Judge Lamdin sought refuge in statements like<br />\n\"You know nothing of war, all you have are misconceptions\". He clearly allowed personal political conviction<br />\nto interfere with his judgement of the case.<br />\nIn convicting a Hopkins student of a disorderly<br />\nconduct charge involving a parking violation some weeks<br />\nago (a decision that was later reversed) Lamdin said,<br />\n\"I don't know what's going on at Hopkins these days.<br />\nWhen I was up there, we never would have thought of<br />\ncalling a policeman an idiot; I just won't stand for it.\"<br />\nFor the Judge's benefit, here is what is happening<br />\nat Hopkins: While most of us would not think of calling a policeman an idiot (which, incidentally the student<br />\nin question never di(1), many of us are prepared to go<br />\nyou one better anti refer to a certain judicial bench<br />\nwarmer in the same terms.<br />\nUnfortunately, the conduct of some of the SDS<br />\nmembers did not enhance the strength of their case.<br />\nJudge Lamdin rightly convicted an SDS member for<br />\nscribbling obscenities on the wall of the Northern District Police Station. Such conduct is immature and not<br />\nin keeping with the sincere moral anti political convictions that motivated the protest.<br />\nSuch a universal loss of dignity and sensibility in a<br />\ncase of this kind is unfortunate, as the issues are quite<br />\nserious. While it would be libelous _to dismiss the whole<br />\nbunch, Judge and scribblers, as bastards, all you really<br />\nhave are misconceptions.<br /><br />\nFortune<br />\nIt means the'difference between going to school and<br />\nnot going to school. It means the difference between<br />\nlearning and not learning. It means the difference between a monumental intellectual and social growth for<br />\nsonic individual, some person who has the capacity, the<br />\nincentive, the moral right to seek knowledge, and the<br />\nloss of that monumental growth. To the average Hoppie<br />\nit means the difference between seeing a flick and missing it, and yet by Wednesday of this week only ninehundred tickets to \"The Boys From Syracuse\" had been<br />\nsold.
