Dr.<br />\nFrench's remarks took the form of<br />\na few words \u2022 of advice which he<br />\nsaid he had to offer, and although<br />\ngiven to Freshmen, the advice is<br />\ngood for every Hopkins man.<br />\nFollowing Dr. French's address<br />\nthe assembly heard a few words<br />\nfrom Coach Van Orman, Mr. Kistler and Assistant Coach Wilcox.<br />\nThe officers of the various activities then presented their organizations' aims to the Freshmen.<br />\nThe number of these executives<br />\nabsent was deplorable and against<br />\nevery Hopkins tradition. During<br />\nthese announcements the whole<br />\nSophomore class filed out in anticipation of the traditional rush<br />\nof<br />\nwhich was to follow the serving<br />\n\u2022<br />\nrefreshments.<br />\nThe rush proved to be a mildly<br />\ninteresting event, in which the<br />\nhonors must go to the Sophomores, although the Freshmen<br />\nsoon became kings of the walk<br />\nwhen they had found a leader to<br />\ntake the place of their president,<br />\nHubert Barton, who was pre\u2022vented from participating by the<br />\nnecessity of keeping in trim for<br />\nthe morrow's football game. The<br />\nSophomores, however, had by this<br />\ntime kidnapped a score or more of<br />\nFreshmen and transported them<br />\nto unknown rural parts.

St. Mary's by 33 to 14 Score. Fumbles Costly for<br />\nBlack and Blue.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins football team ushered in its 1920 season by<br />\ncoming from behind and defeating the eleven of Mt. St. Mary's College<br />\nby the score of 33 to 14. After the first quarter no one could doubt<br />\nthat Hopkins was the superior, both on the offensive and the defensive,<br />\nfor Mt. St. Mary's was unable to stop their powerful smashes through<br />\nthe line, while her own attack, except at rare intervals, was smothered<br />\nby the Black and Blue. The Mountaineers were greatly aided during<br />\nthe first quarter by several costly fumbles committed by Hopkins, but<br />\ntheir early advantage, and with it the gloom of the Homewood stands,<br />\nsoon passed when Van Orman's squad found itself and swung into its<br />\nreal stride.<br />\nThe contest was characterized by both teams' use of straight football, the great majority of the plays being made through the center of<br />\nthe line or off-tackle. Hopkins did not attempt a single forward pass,<br />\nwhile Mt. St. Mary's two attempts were failures; one was grounded<br />\nand the other.intercepted.. Neither side gained much by the numerous<br />\npunts made during the first half, though St. Mary's seemed to get<br />\ndown under the ball faster. The game was a straight contest in line<br />\n\u2022<br />\nplunging, and the more powerful and better trained team won.<br />\nElmer Jones stood head and shoulders above any man on the field,<br />\nalthough it would be hard to pick a really weak spot in the Hopkins<br />\nmachine. He plowed through the line with all his old power, and on<br />\nthe defensive backed up the line with a rush that instilled respect into<br />\nthe biggest upstater on the field. Right behind him were Calkins and<br />\nSkinner with their dashing smashes, and Landy and McKay, who<br />\nalways opened up a big hole when it was most needed. For Mt. St.<br />\nMary's, Captain Chapman was the whole show. He scored all of his<br />\nteam's points, and was, in fact, the only man who could make any<br />\nimpression at all on the Hopkins defense. He seemed to be right in<br />\nthe thick of every play, and supplied the only punch that the Mountaineers possessed.<br />\nMt. St. Mary's scored both their opponents' line for consistent 5<br />\ntouchdowns during the first quar- and 10-yard gains.

In<br />\naddition, several smaller plays,<br />\nsuch as were presented in the<br />\n\"Barn\" last year, will be offered if<br />\nthere is sufficient demand for<br />\nthem. The principal play to be<br />\nproduced has not yet been decided<br />\nupon, but it is regarded as certain<br />\nthat a production of lavish size<br />\nand demanding considerable histronic talent will be offered.<br />\nOpportunities for members of<br />\nthe lower classes to-get a place in<br />\nthe productions of the club are excellent. The club finds itself in<br />\nthe singular position of having but<br />\neight members of the cast and<br />\nbusiness staff remaining, all the<br />\nothers having graduated last<br />\nspring. Consequently, there will<br />\nbe an excellent opportunity for<br />\nambitious men who wish to show<br />\ntheir school spirit to become members of the club and take part in<br />\nthe productions. Notice for tryouts in the cast will be made as<br />\nsoon as the play is definitely decided upon.<br />\nIt is hoped that Miss Clementine Walter, under whose able direction the plays during the last<br />\nthree years have been produced,<br />\ncan be prevailed upon to coach for<br />\none more year. Her assistance in<br />\npast-years has been immensely valuable to the Dramatic Club, and<br />\nthe club would feel completely lost<br />\nwithout her help. Bartus Trew,<br />\npresident of the club, has not returned from his trip west, and in<br />\nthe meantime Holmes Boyd is in<br />\ncomplete charge.<br />\nThe only thing that will limit<br />\nthe activities of the club will be<br />\nthe state of finances, according to<br />\nHolmes Boyd, the business manager. At present the financial affairs of the club are at a rather<br />\nlow ebb and will not permit a very<br />\npretentious schedule, but it is certain that after a thorough reorganization the club will be able to<br />\nfurnish at least as much to the<br />\ndramatic activities of the University as last year.<br />\nAPT COMPARISON.<br />\nRit\u2014Why is kissing your girl<br />\nlike a bottle of olives?<br />\nTers\u2014I don't know.<br />\nRit\u2014If you get one, the rest<br />\ncome easy.\u2014Burr.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, OCTOBER 5, 1920<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\n<br />\ni)titty Tear/nib<br />\n(Moth's?<br />\n<br />\nFORYOUNG MEN AND MEN WHO STAY YOUNG<br />\n<br />\nMarked Style Chan wes<br />\nin Men's Clothes for Fall<br />\nStyle changes for Fall as correctly<br />\ninterpreted by Society Brand Clothes<br />\nwill be heartily welcomed by undergraduates who pay particular heed to<br />\ntheir appearance.<br />\nThe long vent in the coat has gone.<br />\nVents in modish suits this Fall will be<br />\nnoticeably shorter.<br />\nBody contours have changed.

Let us prove that we can<br />\nhave that spirit without them.<br />\nOur athletic outlook far surpasses that of any year previous,<br />\nboth in the schedules and quality<br />\nof play which will be exhibited.<br />\nWe face this year the most difficult schedules yet compiled in every branch of sport; our coaching<br />\nsystem outshines that of previous<br />\nyears, and the material with which<br />\nthe coaches have to work is better than in years past.<br />\n<br />\nThe only way for Johns Hopkins to uphold her end of the arduous schedules assumed this year is<br />\nfor every man in the University to<br />\nput forth his best. Go out for the<br />\nteams. If you are not physically<br />\nqualified to \u2022 make a team, attend<br />\nthe games, cheer your comrades to<br />\nsuccess by your presence and your<br />\nvoice. Show Baltimoreans that<br />\nyou are back of your teams heart<br />\nand soul, ready to support them<br />\nin defeat as well as in victory.<br />\nNothing does a team, fighting an<br />\nuphill battle, more good than to<br />\nknow that every colleze-mate is in<br />\nthe stands, watching its every play<br />\nand pulling for it to deliver the<br />\ngoods.<br />\nWelcome to the University,<br />\nFreshmen! We are truly glad to<br />\naccept you into our midst.<br />\nAs you have all undoubtedly observed, there are a few light regulations which you are called upon<br />\nto obey. Do not get the idea that<br />\nthis is hazing; that these small<br />\nhardships are placed on your<br />\nshoulders by the Sophomores to<br />\nafford them amusement at your<br />\nexpense.<br />\nThese regulations are put in<br />\nforce by the Student Council for<br />\nyour own welfare\u2014to teach you<br />\nyour position in the University, to<br />\nmake true and loyal Hopkins men<br />\nout of you. The Sophomores are<br />\nautomatically appointed to carry<br />\nout these regulations, but bear in<br />\nmind that the entire student body,<br />\nand likewise the faculty, is behind<br />\nthem, ready, if necessary, to aid<br />\nthe Class of '23 in executing them<br />\nto the letter.<br />\nLet us hope that you will obey<br />\nthese regulations with a good<br />\ngrace, accepting them at their face<br />\nvalue, and bearing no malice<br />\nagainst their enforcers.<br />\nIf you do this, rest assured that<br />\nyou will be accepted sooner\u2014and<br />\nwith greater pleasure\u2014as faithful<br />\ncollege-mates.<br />\nAs you may have read elsewhere in this issue, the Johns Hopkins R. 0. T. C. has sent out a plea<br />\nfor recruits. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUnit has ever stood among the<br />\nleaders in this branch of the service, in spite of the many hardships<br />\nwhich it has been called upon to<br />\nface, and the University is justly<br />\nproud of its achievement's.<br />\nThat the Unit may continue to<br />\nhold its place among the leaders,<br />\nit requires the support of the<br />\nstudent-body. It needs men -men ready to work with its interests at heart who are not afraid of<br />\na little trouble and exertion.<br />\nShow Major Gary, whose face<br />\nhas been seen in our midst but a<br />\nshort while, that you are with him<br />\nin his plans to put Hopkins at the<br />\nhead of the R. 0. T. C. Units<br />\nthroughout the country show him<br />\nthat we have red-blooded Americans at college who are willing<br />\nto support a good thing, and enroll<br />\nin the Johns Hopkins Unit. It<br />\nwill be a step which you will have<br />\nno cause to reget later, and will<br />\nafford you splendid training for<br />\nafter-life, as well as giving' you<br />\nseveral credits toward graduation.<br />\n<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER is facing this<br />\nyear an increase in its printing<br />\ncost of over thirty per cent. By<br />\nincreasing its advertising rates<br />\nand raising its subscription it has<br />\nbeen able to meet a large proportion of this increase, but in order<br />\nto have a safe margin it needs a<br />\none hundred per cent. student subscription list. Pay your NEWSLETTER bill now at the postoffice<br />\nor at the NEWS-LETTER office, and<br />\nthus show that the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhas your support.<br />\nWithin the next few days the<br />\nJunior and Senior classes will<br />\nelect their officers for the coming<br />\nyear. The real value of these class<br />\noffices depends upon the ability<br />\nand character of the men Who fill<br />\nthem. It is therefore of the utmost importance that these Masses<br />\nselect suitable men for these positions. They should select men<br />\nwho during their stay at college<br />\nhave proved themselves popular,<br />\nefficient, capable and, above all,<br />\nimbued with college spirit and a<br />\nwillingness to sacrifice themselves<br />\npersonally for the good of the University.

T. C. CALLS FOR RECRUITS.<br />\n<br />\nThe Editor of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhas kindly invited me to write an<br />\narticle explaining the plans for<br />\nthe coming, year in the Military<br />\nDepartment. In availing myself<br />\nof this offer I desire, first, to pay<br />\ntribute to my predecessors, Majors<br />\nGuild and Ellis, for their services<br />\nin this department to the institution. It will be a source of no little satisfaction to the University<br />\nto learn that not only their general policy, but many of the details of their administration, have<br />\nbeen accepted by the War Department as a model, and instructions<br />\nhave just been issued inaugurating the Johns Hopkins system of<br />\nmilitary training in all the colleges and universities of the entire<br />\ncountry having infantry training.<br />\nThe new instructions vitally<br />\nchange all previous R. 0. T. C.<br />\nmethods at all institutions except<br />\nthis one. In this work I was taken<br />\ninto the confidence of the War Department and have assisted somewhat in the preparation of the<br />\nnew scheme of instruction for the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nTo have a Military Department<br />\nin the distinguished class three<br />\nyears after the department was<br />\nstarted is, I believe, a unique record. Major Guild designed the<br />\nstructure and built the foundation. Major Ellis finished the<br />\nwork. It will be my policy to continue their policy.<br />\nThe following interesting and<br />\nfar-reaching method of appointments in the unit goes into effect<br />\nat once: Every second-year man<br />\nwill be a non-commissioned officer. Those who have been most<br />\nproficient and valuable will be sergeant-major or first sergeants<br />\nothers on down to the grade of<br />\nlance corporals. Every man in the<br />\nthird-year course will be a first<br />\nlieutenant, a second lieutenant or<br />\nan additional second lieutenant.<br />\nEvery fourth-year student will be<br />\na field officer, a captain or an additional captain.<br />\nThe purpose of the above arrangement is to put upper classmen in the position of leaders.<br />\nThey are to be given opportunities<br />\nto command, thus developing by<br />\nactual practice the qualities of<br />\nLeadership not only indispensible<br />\nin military activities, but also valuable in most of civic pursuits.<br />\nThe Military Department is not<br />\nwholly attempting to make soldiers out of the men taking its<br />\ntraining. Not one man in a hundred in this University will go in<br />\nthe army. With all other Amen--<br />\n<br />\ncans I hope and pray that we may<br />\nnever again be called upon to go<br />\nto war. But such an ideal cannot<br />\nbe expected. Assuredly in hoping<br />\nwith all our hearts for peace, no<br />\nreal American would have us fail<br />\nto be reasonably prepared for<br />\nwhatever eventualities may arise.<br />\nThe men who served in the<br />\nWorld war have done their full<br />\nand honorable duty. They should<br />\nnow step off the stage. The new<br />\ngeneration should take their<br />\nplaces and assume their work.<br />\nThe R. 0. T. C. is a means for the.<br />\nyoung men to do so.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has taken the<br />\ninitiative in the new War Department's system of training. Its<br />\nschedule for the year is being blueprinted and sent to every college<br />\nin the country that has infantry<br />\ntraining. Also, the Johns Hopkins lesson sheets for the year are<br />\nbeing sent all over the country.<br />\nThat means that we must not<br />\nonly remain on the distinguished<br />\nlist, but that we are making a positive and energetic drive ,to stand<br />\nNo. 1 and to be so recognized<br />\nthroughout the country.<br />\nI can assure every man that<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins unit has the<br />\nrespect and confidence of the War<br />\nOepartment. I have been advised<br />\nthat several important heads of<br />\ndepartments and committees are<br />\ncoming over this next year to inspect the unit and to see at first<br />\nhand the course of instruction<br />\nthat is having far-reaching results<br />\nthroughout the country. To be<br />\nworthy of our task this new department in the University needs<br />\nthe moral support and active assistance of every man in it. The<br />\nquestion is this: Shall we continue to have it grow and develop,<br />\nor shall we rest on laurels previously won? To come up to the<br />\nhighest expectations of the Universi[ty authorities and the War<br />\nDepartment we need two things\u2014<br />\nfirst, good men second, hard<br />\nwork.<br />\nTo be perfectly frank, we want<br />\nno slackers. Only men who want<br />\nto put their shoulders to the wheel<br />\nand 'push hard are desired. The<br />\nGovernment is offering many attractive features to R. 0. T. C.<br />\nmen.. The University grants them<br />\nliberal credits for graduation. I<br />\nhave an adequate staff of most<br />\nable: assistants. We are going to<br />\ngive the R. 0, T. C. men our levelbest work.

It<br />\nis the first team to be backed adequately in a financial way, and is<br />\nunusually fortunate in being sufficiently equipped, fed at a training table and in having the services of so excellent a coach as Dr.<br />\nVan Orman. But these advantages, so customary for other big<br />\ncolleges and so unique at Hopkins, are not nearly so unprecedented as the training trip to<br />\nCamp Red Cloud which the team<br />\ntook during two weeks in September.<br />\nThe main body of the squad arrived in camp Monday morning,<br />\nSeptember 6, and from that moment till they toiled to break<br />\ncamp on Saturday, the 18th, the<br />\naspiring gridders lived a hard,<br />\nregular life, 15 miles from the<br />\nnearest jazz emporium, and that<br />\nsame 15 miles from -\"sugar and<br />\nspice and everything nice.\" But<br />\nthe hardening procesii was not<br />\nleft entirely to the routinte of<br />\ncamp life; the main object of all<br />\nthis hardening was not allowed to<br />\nleave the men's minds for a moment, and Coach Van Orman put<br />\nthem through two driving football<br />\npractices daily. Any spare time<br />\nwas put in with the axe at the<br />\nwoodpile or in the woods, swimming in Silver Lake or canoeing<br />\nthereon, or in that grand old indoor sport of listening to chalk<br />\ntalks.<br />\nAll the time at camp was not<br />\ntaken up with work, however, and<br />\nall the camp life was not hardship, for Camp Red Cloud is a<br />\nreally ideal camp. Situated on<br />\nthe shore of Silver Lake, fairly in<br />\nthe midst of the beautiful trees<br />\nthat fringe its icy waters, the<br />\ncamp offered opportunities for<br />\nrare fishing and swimming. Since<br />\nthe lake is over 1800 feet above<br />\nsea level, it is entirely spring-fed,<br />\nand its waters are so clear that<br />\none can see bottom when the waters are 15 feet deep.<br />\nThe team this year is a good<br />\none, but, facing such an unusually<br />\nheavy schedule, it could scarcely<br />\nhave attempted to start the season without these preparations.<br />\nThe schedule, which follows, contains four big games and no easy<br />\nones:<br />\nOctober 2 \u2014 Mount St. Mary's,<br />\nat Homewood.<br />\n.

Mr. Ortman has been for<br />\nthe past eight years a teacher of<br />\npiano at the Peabody Conservatory of Music, and for some time<br />\ninstructor in music at the Park<br />\nSchool, and has, moreover, done<br />\nquite an amount of composing.<br />\nThe course which he is to give<br />\nrepresents one of the most modern<br />\nand recent branches of experimental psychology, and is one of<br />\nthe first to be attempted in this<br />\nparticular department of the science. Its fundamental problem<br />\nwill be the investigation of the<br />\nunderlying causes of human reactions to certain types of\u2022 sounds<br />\nand of compositions, the reasons<br />\nfor the difference in the impressions conveyed, and the effect of<br />\nvarious outside factors on our general'response.<br />\nSuch a study will lead to a comparison of the different systems of<br />\nmusic, many of which have been<br />\ndeveloped by a particular nation.<br />\nExperiment will also be made<br />\nwith tone systems other than the<br />\none now in universal use throughout Europe and America, which<br />\ndivides the scale into twelve halftones. The chief purpose of the<br />\ninstruction will thus be to show<br />\nthe intimate relation which exists<br />\nbetween science and music, and<br />\nthe dependence of the latter on the<br />\nformer.<br />\nThe new course will also deal<br />\nwith the practical phase of the<br />\nstudy of music, taking up the various forms of music, types of composition, the historical development of harmony,and the study of<br />\nrhythm.<br />\nAlthough the course is intended<br />\nprimarily for graduate students,<br />\nthose who can show sufficient mu<br />\nsical training will be admitted, in<br />\nspite of their lack of bachelor's degree.

Dr.<br />\nFrench's remarks took the form of<br />\na few words \u2022 of advice which he<br />\nsaid he had to offer, and although<br />\ngiven to Freshmen, the advice is<br />\ngood for every Hopkins man.<br />\nFollowing Dr. French's address<br />\nthe assembly heard a few words<br />\nfrom Coach Van Orman, Mr. Kistler and Assistant Coach Wilcox.<br />\nThe officers of the various activities then presented their organizations' aims to the Freshmen.<br />\nThe number of these executives<br />\nabsent was deplorable and against<br />\nevery Hopkins tradition. During<br />\nthese announcements the whole<br />\nSophomore class filed out in anticipation of the traditional rush<br />\nof<br />\nwhich was to follow the serving<br />\n\u2022<br />\nrefreshments.<br />\nThe rush proved to be a mildly<br />\ninteresting event, in which the<br />\nhonors must go to the Sophomores, although the Freshmen<br />\nsoon became kings of the walk<br />\nwhen they had found a leader to<br />\ntake the place of their president,<br />\nHubert Barton, who was pre\u2022vented from participating by the<br />\nnecessity of keeping in trim for<br />\nthe morrow's football game. The<br />\nSophomores, however, had by this<br />\ntime kidnapped a score or more of<br />\nFreshmen and transported them<br />\nto unknown rural parts.

St. Mary's by 33 to 14 Score. Fumbles Costly for<br />\nBlack and Blue.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins football team ushered in its 1920 season by<br />\ncoming from behind and defeating the eleven of Mt. St. Mary's College<br />\nby the score of 33 to 14. After the first quarter no one could doubt<br />\nthat Hopkins was the superior, both on the offensive and the defensive,<br />\nfor Mt. St. Mary's was unable to stop their powerful smashes through<br />\nthe line, while her own attack, except at rare intervals, was smothered<br />\nby the Black and Blue. The Mountaineers were greatly aided during<br />\nthe first quarter by several costly fumbles committed by Hopkins, but<br />\ntheir early advantage, and with it the gloom of the Homewood stands,<br />\nsoon passed when Van Orman's squad found itself and swung into its<br />\nreal stride.<br />\nThe contest was characterized by both teams' use of straight football, the great majority of the plays being made through the center of<br />\nthe line or off-tackle. Hopkins did not attempt a single forward pass,<br />\nwhile Mt. St. Mary's two attempts were failures; one was grounded<br />\nand the other.intercepted.. Neither side gained much by the numerous<br />\npunts made during the first half, though St. Mary's seemed to get<br />\ndown under the ball faster. The game was a straight contest in line<br />\n\u2022<br />\nplunging, and the more powerful and better trained team won.<br />\nElmer Jones stood head and shoulders above any man on the field,<br />\nalthough it would be hard to pick a really weak spot in the Hopkins<br />\nmachine. He plowed through the line with all his old power, and on<br />\nthe defensive backed up the line with a rush that instilled respect into<br />\nthe biggest upstater on the field. Right behind him were Calkins and<br />\nSkinner with their dashing smashes, and Landy and McKay, who<br />\nalways opened up a big hole when it was most needed. For Mt. St.<br />\nMary's, Captain Chapman was the whole show. He scored all of his<br />\nteam's points, and was, in fact, the only man who could make any<br />\nimpression at all on the Hopkins defense. He seemed to be right in<br />\nthe thick of every play, and supplied the only punch that the Mountaineers possessed.<br />\nMt. St. Mary's scored both their opponents' line for consistent 5<br />\ntouchdowns during the first quar- and 10-yard gains. The rush terter, the first one coming on the minated in a great 25-yard run by<br />\ninitial play.

In<br />\naddition, several smaller plays,<br />\nsuch as were presented in the<br />\n\"Barn\" last year, will be offered if<br />\nthere is sufficient demand for<br />\nthem. The principal play to be<br />\nproduced has not yet been decided<br />\nupon, but it is regarded as certain<br />\nthat a production of lavish size<br />\nand demanding considerable histronic talent will be offered.<br />\nOpportunities for members of<br />\nthe lower classes to-get a place in<br />\nthe productions of the club are excellent. The club finds itself in<br />\nthe singular position of having but<br />\neight members of the cast and<br />\nbusiness staff remaining, all the<br />\nothers having graduated last<br />\nspring. Consequently, there will<br />\nbe an excellent opportunity for<br />\nambitious men who wish to show<br />\ntheir school spirit to become members of the club and take part in<br />\nthe productions. Notice for tryouts in the cast will be made as<br />\nsoon as the play is definitely decided upon.<br />\nIt is hoped that Miss Clementine Walter, under whose able direction the plays during the last<br />\nthree years have been produced,<br />\ncan be prevailed upon to coach for<br />\none more year. Her assistance in<br />\npast-years has been immensely valuable to the Dramatic Club, and<br />\nthe club would feel completely lost<br />\nwithout her help. Bartus Trew,<br />\npresident of the club, has not returned from his trip west, and in<br />\nthe meantime Holmes Boyd is in<br />\ncomplete charge.<br />\nThe only thing that will limit<br />\nthe activities of the club will be<br />\nthe state of finances, according to<br />\nHolmes Boyd, the business manager. At present the financial affairs of the club are at a rather<br />\nlow ebb and will not permit a very<br />\npretentious schedule, but it is certain that after a thorough reorganization the club will be able to<br />\nfurnish at least as much to the<br />\ndramatic activities of the University as last year.<br />\nAPT COMPARISON.<br />\nRit\u2014Why is kissing your girl<br />\nlike a bottle of olives?<br />\nTers\u2014I don't know.<br />\nRit\u2014If you get one, the rest<br />\ncome easy.\u2014Burr.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, OCTOBER 5, 1920<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br /><br />\ni)titty Tear/nib<br />\n(Moth's?<br /><br />\nFORYOUNG MEN AND MEN WHO STAY YOUNG<br /><br />\nMarked Style Chan wes<br />\nin Men's Clothes for Fall<br />\nStyle changes for Fall as correctly<br />\ninterpreted by Society Brand Clothes<br />\nwill be heartily welcomed by undergraduates who pay particular heed to<br />\ntheir appearance.<br />\nThe long vent in the coat has gone.<br />\nVents in modish suits this Fall will be<br />\nnoticeably shorter.<br />\nBody contours have changed.

With their<br />\ncompletion the \"big family\" at<br />\nHomewood wil feel itself to be<br />\ntruly a crowd of brothers, pulling<br />\never more and more for each tither<br />\nand for the Alma Mater, and the<br />\ncollege spirit manifested at other<br />\ncolleges will, we have every con- fidence in assuming, find adequate<br />\nsoil for growth at Homewood.<br />\nBut why wait for the dormitories? Let us prove that we can<br />\nhave that spirit without them.<br />\nOur athletic outlook far surpasses that of any year previous,<br />\nboth in the schedules and quality<br />\nof play which will be exhibited.<br />\nWe face this year the most difficult schedules yet compiled in every branch of sport; our coaching<br />\nsystem outshines that of previous<br />\nyears, and the material with which<br />\nthe coaches have to work is better than in years past.<br /><br />\nThe only way for Johns Hopkins to uphold her end of the arduous schedules assumed this year is<br />\nfor every man in the University to<br />\nput forth his best. Go out for the<br />\nteams. If you are not physically<br />\nqualified to \u2022 make a team, attend<br />\nthe games, cheer your comrades to<br />\nsuccess by your presence and your<br />\nvoice. Show Baltimoreans that<br />\nyou are back of your teams heart<br />\nand soul, ready to support them<br />\nin defeat as well as in victory.<br />\nNothing does a team, fighting an<br />\nuphill battle, more good than to<br />\nknow that every colleze-mate is in<br />\nthe stands, watching its every play<br />\nand pulling for it to deliver the<br />\ngoods.<br />\nWelcome to the University,<br />\nFreshmen! We are truly glad to<br />\naccept you into our midst.<br />\nAs you have all undoubtedly observed, there are a few light regulations which you are called upon<br />\nto obey. Do not get the idea that<br />\nthis is hazing; that these small<br />\nhardships are placed on your<br />\nshoulders by the Sophomores to<br />\nafford them amusement at your<br />\nexpense.<br />\nThese regulations are put in<br />\nforce by the Student Council for<br />\nyour own welfare\u2014to teach you<br />\nyour position in the University, to<br />\nmake true and loyal Hopkins men<br />\nout of you. The Sophomores are<br />\nautomatically appointed to carry<br />\nout these regulations, but bear in<br />\nmind that the entire student body,<br />\nand likewise the faculty, is behind<br />\nthem, ready, if necessary, to aid<br />\nthe Class of '23 in executing them<br />\nto the letter.<br />\nLet us hope that you will obey<br />\nthese regulations with a good<br />\ngrace, accepting them at their face<br />\nvalue, and bearing no malice<br />\nagainst their enforcers.<br />\nIf you do this, rest assured that<br />\nyou will be accepted sooner\u2014and<br />\nwith greater pleasure\u2014as faithful<br />\ncollege-mates.<br />\nAs you may have read elsewhere in this issue, the Johns Hopkins R. 0. T. C. has sent out a plea<br />\nfor recruits. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUnit has ever stood among the<br />\nleaders in this branch of the service, in spite of the many hardships<br />\nwhich it has been called upon to<br />\nface, and the University is justly<br />\nproud of its achievement's.<br />\nThat the Unit may continue to<br />\nhold its place among the leaders,<br />\nit requires the support of the<br />\nstudent-body. It needs men -men ready to work with its interests at heart who are not afraid of<br />\na little trouble and exertion.<br />\nShow Major Gary, whose face<br />\nhas been seen in our midst but a<br />\nshort while, that you are with him<br />\nin his plans to put Hopkins at the<br />\nhead of the R. 0. T. C. Units<br />\nthroughout the country show him<br />\nthat we have red-blooded Americans at college who are willing<br />\nto support a good thing, and enroll<br />\nin the Johns Hopkins Unit. It<br />\nwill be a step which you will have<br />\nno cause to reget later, and will<br />\nafford you splendid training for<br />\nafter-life, as well as giving' you<br />\nseveral credits toward graduation.<br /><br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER is facing this<br />\nyear an increase in its printing<br />\ncost of over thirty per cent. By<br />\nincreasing its advertising rates<br />\nand raising its subscription it has<br />\nbeen able to meet a large proportion of this increase, but in order<br />\nto have a safe margin it needs a<br />\none hundred per cent. student subscription list.

It is therefore of the utmost importance that these Masses<br />\nselect suitable men for these positions.

T. C. CALLS FOR RECRUITS.<br /><br />\nThe Editor of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nhas kindly invited me to write an<br />\narticle explaining the plans for<br />\nthe coming, year in the Military<br />\nDepartment. In availing myself<br />\nof this offer I desire, first, to pay<br />\ntribute to my predecessors, Majors<br />\nGuild and Ellis, for their services<br />\nin this department to the institution. It will be a source of no little satisfaction to the University<br />\nto learn that not only their general policy, but many of the details of their administration, have<br />\nbeen accepted by the War Department as a model, and instructions<br />\nhave just been issued inaugurating the Johns Hopkins system of<br />\nmilitary training in all the colleges and universities of the entire<br />\ncountry having infantry training.<br />\nThe new instructions vitally<br />\nchange all previous R. 0. T. C.<br />\nmethods at all institutions except<br />\nthis one. In this work I was taken<br />\ninto the confidence of the War Department and have assisted somewhat in the preparation of the<br />\nnew scheme of instruction for the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nTo have a Military Department<br />\nin the distinguished class three<br />\nyears after the department was<br />\nstarted is, I believe, a unique record. Major Guild designed the<br />\nstructure and built the foundation. Major Ellis finished the<br />\nwork. It will be my policy to continue their policy.<br />\nThe following interesting and<br />\nfar-reaching method of appointments in the unit goes into effect<br />\nat once: Every second-year man<br />\nwill be a non-commissioned officer. Those who have been most<br />\nproficient and valuable will be sergeant-major or first sergeants<br />\nothers on down to the grade of<br />\nlance corporals. Every man in the<br />\nthird-year course will be a first<br />\nlieutenant, a second lieutenant or<br />\nan additional second lieutenant.<br />\nEvery fourth-year student will be<br />\na field officer, a captain or an additional captain.<br />\nThe purpose of the above arrangement is to put upper classmen in the position of leaders.<br />\nThey are to be given opportunities<br />\nto command, thus developing by<br />\nactual practice the qualities of<br />\nLeadership not only indispensible<br />\nin military activities, but also valuable in most of civic pursuits.<br />\nThe Military Department is not<br />\nwholly attempting to make soldiers out of the men taking its<br />\ntraining. Not one man in a hundred in this University will go in<br />\nthe army. With all other Amen--<br /><br />\ncans I hope and pray that we may<br />\nnever again be called upon to go<br />\nto war. But such an ideal cannot<br />\nbe expected. Assuredly in hoping<br />\nwith all our hearts for peace, no<br />\nreal American would have us fail<br />\nto be reasonably prepared for<br />\nwhatever eventualities may arise.<br />\nThe men who served in the<br />\nWorld war have done their full<br />\nand honorable duty. They should<br />\nnow step off the stage. The new<br />\ngeneration should take their<br />\nplaces and assume their work.<br />\nThe R. 0. T. C. is a means for the.<br />\nyoung men to do so.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has taken the<br />\ninitiative in the new War Department's system of training. Its<br />\nschedule for the year is being blueprinted and sent to every college<br />\nin the country that has infantry<br />\ntraining. Also, the Johns Hopkins lesson sheets for the year are<br />\nbeing sent all over the country.<br />\nThat means that we must not<br />\nonly remain on the distinguished<br />\nlist, but that we are making a positive and energetic drive ,to stand<br />\nNo. 1 and to be so recognized<br />\nthroughout the country.<br />\nI can assure every man that<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins unit has the<br />\nrespect and confidence of the War<br />\nOepartment. I have been advised<br />\nthat several important heads of<br />\ndepartments and committees are<br />\ncoming over this next year to inspect the unit and to see at first<br />\nhand the course of instruction<br />\nthat is having far-reaching results<br />\nthroughout the country. To be<br />\nworthy of our task this new department in the University needs<br />\nthe moral support and active assistance of every man in it. The<br />\nquestion is this: Shall we continue to have it grow and develop,<br />\nor shall we rest on laurels previously won? To come up to the<br />\nhighest expectations of the Universi[ty authorities and the War<br />\nDepartment we need two things\u2014<br />\nfirst, good men second, hard<br />\nwork.<br />\nTo be perfectly frank, we want<br />\nno slackers. Only men who want<br />\nto put their shoulders to the wheel<br />\nand 'push hard are desired. The<br />\nGovernment is offering many attractive features to R. 0. T. C.<br />\nmen.. The University grants them<br />\nliberal credits for graduation. I<br />\nhave an adequate staff of most<br />\nable: assistants. We are going to<br />\ngive the R. 0, T. C. men our levelbest work.

It<br />\nis the first team to be backed adequately in a financial way, and is<br />\nunusually fortunate in being sufficiently equipped, fed at a training table and in having the services of so excellent a coach as Dr.<br />\nVan Orman. But these advantages, so customary for other big<br />\ncolleges and so unique at Hopkins, are not nearly so unprecedented as the training trip to<br />\nCamp Red Cloud which the team<br />\ntook during two weeks in September.<br />\nThe main body of the squad arrived in camp Monday morning,<br />\nSeptember 6, and from that moment till they toiled to break<br />\ncamp on Saturday, the 18th, the<br />\naspiring gridders lived a hard,<br />\nregular life, 15 miles from the<br />\nnearest jazz emporium, and that<br />\nsame 15 miles from -\"sugar and<br />\nspice and everything nice.\" But<br />\nthe hardening procesii was not<br />\nleft entirely to the routinte of<br />\ncamp life; the main object of all<br />\nthis hardening was not allowed to<br />\nleave the men's minds for a moment, and Coach Van Orman put<br />\nthem through two driving football<br />\npractices daily. Any spare time<br />\nwas put in with the axe at the<br />\nwoodpile or in the woods, swimming in Silver Lake or canoeing<br />\nthereon, or in that grand old indoor sport of listening to chalk<br />\ntalks.<br />\nAll the time at camp was not<br />\ntaken up with work, however, and<br />\nall the camp life was not hardship, for Camp Red Cloud is a<br />\nreally ideal camp. Situated on<br />\nthe shore of Silver Lake, fairly in<br />\nthe midst of the beautiful trees<br />\nthat fringe its icy waters, the<br />\ncamp offered opportunities for<br />\nrare fishing and swimming. Since<br />\nthe lake is over 1800 feet above<br />\nsea level, it is entirely spring-fed,<br />\nand its waters are so clear that<br />\none can see bottom when the waters are 15 feet deep.<br />\nThe team this year is a good<br />\none, but, facing such an unusually<br />\nheavy schedule, it could scarcely<br />\nhave attempted to start the season without these preparations.<br />\nThe schedule, which follows, contains four big games and no easy<br />\nones:<br />\nOctober 2 \u2014 Mount St. Mary's,<br />\nat Homewood.<br />\n.

Mr. Ortman has been for<br />\nthe past eight years a teacher of<br />\npiano at the Peabody Conservatory of Music, and for some time<br />\ninstructor in music at the Park<br />\nSchool, and has, moreover, done<br />\nquite an amount of composing.<br />\nThe course which he is to give<br />\nrepresents one of the most modern<br />\nand recent branches of experimental psychology, and is one of<br />\nthe first to be attempted in this<br />\nparticular department of the science. Its fundamental problem<br />\nwill be the investigation of the<br />\nunderlying causes of human reactions to certain types of\u2022 sounds<br />\nand of compositions, the reasons<br />\nfor the difference in the impressions conveyed, and the effect of<br />\nvarious outside factors on our general'response.<br />\nSuch a study will lead to a comparison of the different systems of<br />\nmusic, many of which have been<br />\ndeveloped by a particular nation.<br />\nExperiment will also be made<br />\nwith tone systems other than the<br />\none now in universal use throughout Europe and America, which<br />\ndivides the scale into twelve halftones. The chief purpose of the<br />\ninstruction will thus be to show<br />\nthe intimate relation which exists<br />\nbetween science and music, and<br />\nthe dependence of the latter on the<br />\nformer.<br />\nThe new course will also deal<br />\nwith the practical phase of the<br />\nstudy of music, taking up the various forms of music, types of composition, the historical development of harmony,and the study of<br />\nrhythm.<br />\nAlthough the course is intended<br />\nprimarily for graduate students,<br />\nthose who can show sufficient mu<br />\nsical training will be admitted, in<br />\nspite of their lack of bachelor's degree. Moreover, a large amount of<br />\ntechnical training is not required,<br />\nfor one need not be able to play a<br />\nparticular instrument to gain ad<br />\nmission.<br />\nNovember 13\u2014St. John's College, at Homewood.<br />\nNovember 20 \u2014 Western Maryland College, at Homewood.<br />\nNovember 25 \u2014 University of<br />\nMaryland (Maryland State), at<br />\nHomewood.<br /><br />\nJ.
