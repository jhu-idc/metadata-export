Undoubtedly, the Student Council<br />\nWill be a more effective organization with these new representatives, and in the future there<br />\nWill be less conflict among campus organizations.<br />\nHowever, we were very sorry<br />\nto see that the enlargement<br />\nstopped where it did. It seems<br />\nto us that if the News-Letter<br />\nis represented, then WJHU, the<br />\ncampus radio station, should be<br />\nalso; if the Cotillion Board, then<br />\nthe 'Y' Cabinet. The Engineering Control Board certainly deserves a place on the SC, but an<br />\nArts and Sciences Control Board<br />\nand a Business Control Board<br />\nshould be created to represent<br />\nthese students too. Last year's<br />\nadmission of the IFB President<br />\nShould be followed by the creation of an officer to represent<br />\nthe GDI's, and perhaps the Baltimore students need a vote to<br />\nbalance the DSRC's vote.<br />\nSince the Deans and Chairmen of all the departments will<br />\nfind the new SC a perfect place<br />\nfor dealing with the student<br />\nbody, they also should be voted<br />\nto membership. In fact, there is<br />\nno reason why anybody should<br />\nbe excluded from the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nJoseph H. Condon<br />\nTheodore W. Palmer<br />\nRecently the editors of the<br />\nNews-Letter received a letter<br />\nsigned Magna E.

I specifically<br />\nrefer to the conflict between the<br />\nIFB and the CB concerning a<br />\ndance program conflict. It is<br />\nquite inconceivable that this difficulty will arise again for a long<br />\ntime and if and when it does it<br />\ncan be settled by the SC just as<br />\nwell without having the CB as a<br />\nvoting member. In my opinion<br />\nthe SC settled it very well this<br />\ntime.<br />\nOne must realize that a certain<br />\namount of responsibility is given<br />\nto an elected member of the SC<br />\nand he must be prepared to<br />\nshoulder it and .act accordingly.<br />\nEveryone cannot be satisfied by<br />\na particular decision and the less<br />\nbiased the Council, the more<br />\njust their decision.

The CB<br />\nis definitely not in this category<br />\nand this is not to say that it<br />\ndoesn't do good work. When and<br />\nif a situation arises where social<br />\nplanning a drive is needed, it is<br />\na simple matter to send a committee of one from the SC and<br />\nask for advice. It does not require that the CB be given a<br />\nvote ccncerning non-social matters.<br />\nAs for the NL I am completely<br />\nopposed to the idea of forcing the<br />\nNL to be a member when they<br />\nare so violently opposed as they<br />\nare. I rather feel that a ''balance of power\" is struck between<br />\nthe NL and the SC, and if the<br />\nNL is to be made a voting member of the SC, then they are<br />\ntacitly required to sanction the<br />\nactions of the SC.<br />\nGranted that the NL is, on<br />\noccasion, seemingly unjust, it<br />\nperforms a necessary service in<br />\nbringing to light the actions of<br />\nthe SC in a critical light.<br />\nIn all humbleness, may I suggest that the referendum be defeated for the sake of maintaining a true representative<br />\ngovernment for the student body.<br />\nPenn Lupovich<br />\n<br />\nPirates Hang 'Jolly Roger'<br />\nFrom University Mainmast<br />\nA black flag, described by observers as a \"Jolly Roger,\" was<br />\nremoved from the flagpole near<br />\nHomewood House with considerable difficulty.

A. Speech To Retain Freedom<br />\nDr. Milton Eisenhower, speaking before the Advertising Council in Los Angeles, California,<br />\nthis week, again stated the need<br />\nfor revision of American education at all levels.<br />\nHe acknowledged that, \"with<br />\nperspective, .. . the American<br />\nsystem of mass education is the<br />\ngreatest and most efficient ever<br />\ndevised and maintained by any<br />\nsociety.\"<br />\nStill, he maintained, a problem is now present, and he defined this problem as partly \"a<br />\nquantitative one.\" Also, \"the<br />\nquality of teaching is unfortunately on a toboggan.

He<br />\nstated that \"we must improve<br />\nthe quality of the entire educational program. ...

It also calls for<br />\na degree of maturity, experience,<br />\nand an informed judgment with<br />\nrespect to available choices. .. .<br />\nPatently, this improvement must<br />\nbegin with the elementary and<br />\nsecondary schools.\"<br />\nDr. Eisenhower mentioned that<br />\nthe secondary schools in partic-<br />\n<br />\nular fail to prepare capable students adequately. He stated that<br />\nmany students capable of academic accomplishment \"are not<br />\nreceiving their due.

Undoubtedly, the Student Council<br />\nWill be a more effective organization with these new representatives, and in the future there<br />\nWill be less conflict among campus organizations.<br />\nHowever, we were very sorry<br />\nto see that the enlargement<br />\nstopped where it did. It seems<br />\nto us that if the News-Letter<br />\nis represented, then WJHU, the<br />\ncampus radio station, should be<br />\nalso; if the Cotillion Board, then<br />\nthe 'Y' Cabinet. The Engineering Control Board certainly deserves a place on the SC, but an<br />\nArts and Sciences Control Board<br />\nand a Business Control Board<br />\nshould be created to represent<br />\nthese students too. Last year's<br />\nadmission of the IFB President<br />\nShould be followed by the creation of an officer to represent<br />\nthe GDI's, and perhaps the Baltimore students need a vote to<br />\nbalance the DSRC's vote.<br />\nSince the Deans and Chairmen of all the departments will<br />\nfind the new SC a perfect place<br />\nfor dealing with the student<br />\nbody, they also should be voted<br />\nto membership.

It is<br />\nquite inconceivable that this difficulty will arise again for a long<br />\ntime and if and when it does it<br />\ncan be settled by the SC just as<br />\nwell without having the CB as a<br />\nvoting member. In my opinion<br />\nthe SC settled it very well this<br />\ntime.<br />\nOne must realize that a certain<br />\namount of responsibility is given<br />\nto an elected member of the SC<br />\nand he must be prepared to<br />\nshoulder it and .act accordingly.<br />\nEveryone cannot be satisfied by<br />\na particular decision and the less<br />\nbiased the Council, the more<br />\njust their decision.

A. Speech To Retain Freedom<br />\nDr. Milton Eisenhower, speaking before the Advertising Council in Los Angeles, California,<br />\nthis week, again stated the need<br />\nfor revision of American education at all levels.<br />\nHe acknowledged that, \"with<br />\nperspective, .. . the American<br />\nsystem of mass education is the<br />\ngreatest and most efficient ever<br />\ndevised and maintained by any<br />\nsociety.\"<br />\nStill, he maintained, a problem is now present, and he defined this problem as partly \"a<br />\nquantitative one.\" Also, \"the<br />\nquality of teaching is unfortunately on a toboggan. Thousands<br />\nof teachers with inferior preparation are in our elementary and<br />\nsecondary schools, and at the<br />\nhigher levels the percentage of<br />\nnew teachers who have the Ph.D.<br />\nis each year declining.<br />\nReduction In Quality<br />\n\"This reduction in quality,<br />\ncaused by a tremendous upsurge<br />\nin student numbers, is occurring<br />\nat a time when we already have<br />\na serious qualitative problem on<br />\nour hands.\"<br />\nDr. Eisenhower again proposed<br />\nhis remedies for this problem. He<br />\nstated that \"we must improve<br />\nthe quality of the entire educational program. ... One obvious<br />\nreason why this is so, is this:<br />\nmost students ... do not decide<br />\nupon areas of specialization until<br />\nthey are well advanced in their<br />\ncollegiate studies.\"<br />\nRequires Preparations<br />\n\"In other words,\" he continued,<br />\n\"wise ultimate choice requires<br />\nsound preparation which is essentially common to all fields of<br />\nspecialization. It also calls for<br />\na degree of maturity, experience,<br />\nand an informed judgment with<br />\nrespect to available choices. .. .<br />\nPatently, this improvement must<br />\nbegin with the elementary and<br />\nsecondary schools.\"<br />\nDr. Eisenhower mentioned that<br />\nthe secondary schools in partic-<br /><br />\nular fail to prepare capable students adequately. He stated that<br />\nmany students capable of academic accomplishment \"are not<br />\nreceiving their due. Our secondary schools, in response to<br />\npublic pressures, have tended to<br />\nproliferate themselves into decreased quality. Our secondary<br />\nschools, collectively, now offer<br />\nchoices in several hundred different subjects, many of them<br />\nvocational. There is no substitute,<br />\nin preparatory education, for<br />\nrigorous study of such fundamentals as mathematics, English, a foreign language, science,<br />\nhistory and social studies.<br />\nNot Opposed<br />\n\"I\u2022am not opposed to classes<br />\nin driver-training, typing, stenography, woodworking, cooking, social dancing, industrial<br />\nprocesses, and the like, except<br />\nwhen they are substituted for<br />\nsound intellectual development.<br />\nSince hours of instruction are<br />\nlimited ,this is what too often<br />\nhappens. I would therefore remove all peripheral subjects<br />\nfrom the curriculums of those<br />\nwho are capable of pursuing the<br />\nmore rigorous academic subjects,<br />\nand concentrate these subjects in<br />\na thirteenth high school year for<br />\nthose who want terminal vocational education.\"<br />\nContinuing, Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nstated that he \"would increase<br />\nthe academic load of all capable students. We are too casual<br />\nabout education. This is the primary reason why European students achieve scholastically in<br />\nten years what ours do in<br />\ntwelve\u2014and it happens that<br />\nmost students do better work<br />\nwith a heavy load than a light<br />\none. I would then sectionalize all<br />\nclasses, so that every student is<br />\nconstantly challenged intellectually in the educational process.\"<br />\nMust Increase Quality<br />\nThe Hopkins president recommended further reforms, saying<br />\nthat \"we must increase the qual-<br /><br />\nFreshmen, Sop/is To Dine<br />\nAt Banquets During Week<br />\nBoth the Class of '60 and the day, April 30, at 6 p.m. in LeverClass of '61 will hold their ban- ing Great Hall.<br />\nquets during the coming week.<br />\nAccording to sophomore Class<br />\nThe Class of '61- Banquet will President Rod Simonsen the<br />\ntake place tonight at 6:15 in principal speaker will be UniverLevering Great Hall.
