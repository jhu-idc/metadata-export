Not only does the document written by<br />\nDean Benton implicitly intimidate students with the fear<br />\nthat their protests may come under its general<br />\nguidelines, the code also allows the dean complete<br />\nflexibility in determining all punishments.<br />\nBenton's report states that punishments will be meted<br />\nout for crimes ranging from building take-overs to<br />\ncamping without permission on University grounds,<br />\nadding he can punish any orther sort of \"disruptive\"<br />\nbehavior.<br />\nOnce a complaint is issued, the code provides that<br />\n\"the administration shall always act as the prosecutor.\"<br />\nAnd who makes up the jury?

Nothing New<br />\n<br />\nFor some background on student discipline--the<br />\nHopkins way--look back to the May suspensions. Almost<br />\nevery step of the \"judiciary procedure\" was fraught<br />\nwith injustice under cover of slick manipulations by<br />\nDeans Benton and Kimball.<br />\nAfter the deans suspended 12 of 30 students who<br />\nrefused to leave an Academic Council meeting, a<br />\nhearing board was set up to review the case. But the<br />\ndeans authorized the board only to issue a statement of<br />\nfacts about the suspensions.<br />\nWhen the hearing board (the 3 professors, by the way,<br />\nwere picked by the deans) defied their charge, the deans<br />\nignored their recommendations that the sentences were<br />\ntoo harsh and the procedure arbitrary.<br />\nRefusing to make the hearing board report public, the<br />\ndeans instead issued their own version to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity saying they were \"neutral parts\" of the<br />\ncontroversy.<br />\nParalleling the suspensions was the investigation of<br />\nDrs. Pepper and Pfeffer. To form an impartial jury, the<br />\ndeans picked an investigative committee composed of 3<br />\nAcademic Council members present during the<br />\ndisturbance. Since Dr. Pepper is protected by the<br />\nAAUP, he got off the hook with a powerless censure,<br />\nwhile the students, charged with exactly the same<br />\ncrime, were suspended. Pfeffer was given a letter of<br />\nreprimand by the Dean.<br />\nClearly, students at Hopkins are second class citizens.<br />\n<br />\nWomen As Salvation<br />\nBy HENRY SUSSMAN<br />\nThis is simply to welcome you, undergraduate women, to Hopkins, to point out<br />\nsome of the reasons why your belated<br />\npresence is perhaps the most important<br />\ndevelopment ever to take place here, and to<br />\nencourage you to join together and actively<br />\nimplei-nent the necessary environmental<br />\nchanges that would be impossible without<br />\nyou.<br />\nThe predominant spirit motivating this<br />\ncommunity becomes apparent in the form of<br />\nits architecture.

Pepper and Pfeffer. To form an impartial jury, the<br />\ndeans picked an investigative committee composed of 3<br />\nAcademic Council members present during the<br />\ndisturbance. Since Dr. Pepper is protected by the<br />\nAAUP, he got off the hook with a powerless censure,<br />\nwhile the students, charged with exactly the same<br />\ncrime, were suspended.

It is an area of varied<br />\nlifestyles: rich liberals and conservatives, poor blacks and<br />\nw<br />\norking-class whites.<br />\nSarbanes is backed by labor and<br />\nnational peace groups, while Fallon<br />\nis being<br />\naided by highway contractors throughout the country, as<br />\nhe was in<br />\n1968, when he narrowly<br />\nbeat back a challenge from another<br />\nPeace candidate.<br />\nSarbanes, who first opposed the<br />\nwar in 1968 as<br />\nstate coordinator for<br />\nBobby Kennedy, condemns Fallon's<br />\nsupport of Administration policy.<br />\nFallon responds, \"The President's<br />\nProgram is close<br />\nto the HatfieldMcGovern amendment. He is taking<br />\nthem out in an orderly<br />\nfashion.\"<br />\nThe challenger has also made an<br />\nissue of the highway programs<br />\nwhich Fallon advocates.<br />\nSarbanes asserts that the cities<br />\nmass transist systems, rather<br />\nthan more<br />\nhighways, and he attacks<br />\nFallon's brainchild, the Highway<br />\nTrust Fund, which is the country's<br />\nmain source of transportation<br />\nmoney. Fallon conceived of the<br />\nHighway Trust Fund in 1956 when he<br />\nWas chairman of the roads subcommittee of the Public Works<br />\n<br />\n(Articles this page written by Art Levine]<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nThe Trust Fund provides 90%<br />\nFederal funding for the Interstate<br />\nHighway System, and the revenue is<br />\ngathered from federal gas taxes,<br />\nand taxes on oil, tires and parts.<br />\nThis Federal largesse far exceeded the usual 50% shares for road<br />\nprojects, and so an expressway<br />\nboom was launched.<br />\nRecently, however, criticism from<br />\nsome quarters has mounted against<br />\nthe Fund for restricting itself only to<br />\nhighways. Sarbanes has attacked<br />\nFallon for opposing a more varied<br />\nuse of the Trust Fund revenues.<br />\n\"I think both mass transit and<br />\nhighways are needed,\" Fallon answers. \"There's no way you can<br />\ndisplace highways. What's good for<br />\nthe national economy is good for the<br />\ncity.\"<br />\nSarbanes also criticizes Fallon for<br />\nthe financial support he receivesfrom<br />\n\"I get conhighway-builders.<br />\ntributions from my friends,\" Fallon<br />\nresponds, \"and some of my friends<br />\nare in industry.\"<br />\nFallon, who became chairman of<br />\nthe Public Works Committee in 1965,<br />\ncontends that the new highways do<br />\nnot hurt the public interest. \"The<br />\npeople who build them, build them<br />\nfor the public,\" he declares. \"The<br />\nonly highway lobby I support are the<br />\nmotorists.\" The 68-year-old Congressman<br />\nfeels that the most important<br />\nproblem facing the country today is<br />\npollution. His committee considers<br />\nall water pollution measures, and he<br />\nhas sponsored all major water<br />\nquaity legislation.<br />\nHe wrote the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970, which, his<br />\ncampaign brochure says, is<br />\n\"probably the single most important<br />\npiece of legislation passed by the<br />\n91st Congress.\"<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br />\n<br />\nDistrict's<br />\nSeventh<br />\nThe<br />\nDemocratic primary is a tight threeway race between an old Jewish<br />\nliberal, a young Jewish liberal and a<br />\ncontroversial black activist.<br />\nSam Friedel, 72, is running for his<br />\ntenth Congressional seat in the<br />\ndistrict he has served since its<br />\ngerrymandered formation in 1952.<br />\nHe is widely known to be the candidate of political boss Jack Pollack.<br />\nThreatening Friedel's reign--and<br />\nPollack's--are two challengers,<br />\nState Senator Carl Friedler, 35, and<br />\nMorgan State Professor Parren J.<br />\nMitchell, 47, Mitchell was 5,000 votes<br />\nshort of the laurels last time after a<br />\nhastily organized campaign.<br />\nThe district includes West<br />\nBaltimore and part of Baltimore<br />\nCounty inside the Beltway.

His voting record<br />\nis liberal, yet his two political<br />\nthreats contend he hasn't provided a<br />\nleadership role.<br />\nMitchell declares, \"Freidel has<br />\nsignificant<br />\nno<br />\nintroduced<br />\nlegislation, and Baltimore ranks<br />\nvery low in Federal Aid.\"<br />\nAdds Friedler,\"Sam is part of the<br />\nEstablishment, he's tied into the<br />\nwhole seniority and patronage<br />\nsystem.\"<br />\nFriedel counters, \"Not one time<br />\nhave they attacked my voting<br />\nrecord. My voting record is perfect-Mitchell couldn't have done better.<br />\nWe were eigth in HEW aid.

But, he adds, \"I've voted<br />\nto give our boys arms and knowhow.\"<br />\nAlthough both his opponents<br />\ncharge that Friedel is out of touch<br />\nwith his district, he denies it. \"Why,<br />\nyou should see the stacks of letters I<br />\nget--and I get them from all the<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nAlthough both of Friedel's pursuers seem to be running a similar<br />\nliberal campaign, there are some<br />\npolicy differences between them.<br />\nThe other candidates have aiready<br />\nconceded the black vote to Mitchell,<br />\nbut he hopes to snare some white<br />\nliberals.

Benton, the<br />\nformer chairman of the Department of<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences, was selected<br />\nas the principle administrator (the Dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences) of Homewood.<br />\nHis selection came in the midst of student<br />\nturmoil over the University's involvement in<br />\nwar- related research and the hotly-debated<br />\nand as yet unresolved question of governance of the University.<br />\nThe two problems are related to a third,<br />\nmore basic issue--the gulf that has occurred<br />\nbetween the students and the administrators.<br />\nThe story is often told over coffee or a<br />\nfriendly beer of the time of Dr. Eisenhower<br />\n(Dr. Milton S. Eisenhower, JHU President<br />\n1956-66) and of Dean G. Wilson Shaffer and<br />\nStudent Affairs Director Dr. W. Kelso<br />\nMorrill.<br />\nDr. Morrill, an avid lacrosse fan and<br />\nformer coach and the nemisis and friend of<br />\ndecades of Hopkins undergrads, died in 1967.<br />\nDr. Eisenhower and Dr. Shaffer have<br />\nretired.<br />\nThe story relates that in those days the<br />\nundergraduates were treated as people.<br />\nEach of the three key administrators could<br />\nassociate the names with the faces of over 90<br />\npercent of the students.<br />\nThe personal relationships formed with<br />\nthese men made JHU a better place for those<br />\nstudents who wanted to study and enjoy their<br />\ncollege days.<br />\nIt Was no coincidence that the three administrators made every effort to be with the<br />\n<br />\nstudents especially in athletic endeavors.<br />\nEach year over 300 undergrads participate<br />\nin intercollegiate athletics, over 400 play on<br />\nintramural teams, over 500 use the gymnasium frequently and most of the rest<br />\nspectate at football, lacrosse or soccer<br />\ncontests.<br />\nThe Eisenhower-Shaffer-Morrill administration knew those students and<br />\nlearned to like most of them. The reverse<br />\nwas also true--the students liked the men<br />\nwho were to them the embodiment of<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nConfrontation politics with its pettiness,<br />\nfear and hatreds were impossible in such an<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nFollowing the Eisenhower era at JHU, the<br />\nDirector of Student Affairs was relegated to<br />\nthe position of a powerless buffer between an<br />\nathletic department with a large number of<br />\nneeds and controversies and the decisionmakers who chose to remain aloof from the<br />\nstudents and their interests.<br />\nDean Benton could change all of that now.<br />\nThe athletic director should report directly<br />\nto the Dean with the almost daily conflicts<br />\nand problems that arise when athletic<br />\nprograms are run with too little money.<br />\nQuestions of policy should be decided by the<br />\nDean who is the person responsible for the<br />\nallocation or withholding of budget funds.<br />\nBut more important than all of the administrative changes, the Dean should learn<br />\nthe names and faces of the majority of the<br />\nstudents and require that his subordinates do<br />\nthe same.<br />\nThe Dean might find that he even likes<br />\nmost of us.<br />\n<br />\nNCAA to Decide Stick Champ<br />\n<br />\nSenior quarterback Bob Pfieffer, one-half of Hopkins' one-two<br />\nquarterback punch.<br />\n<br />\nThis year, the National<br />\nCollegiate<br />\nAthletic<br />\nAssociation voted to accept<br />\nlacrosse as a national sport<br />\nunder its jurisdiction.<br />\nThere will now be a playoff<br />\nsystem similar to the one in<br />\nbasketball.

More definite<br />\nchanges will require concerted political and<br />\ncultural activity, among yourselves, and<br />\ntogether with the groups that have already<br />\nformed in order to effect necessary reforms.<br />\nAlthough it caters to the scions of the<br />\nupper classes, in its political, social, and<br />\npsycho-sexual dimensions, Hopkins remains<br />\nan underpriveleged area.<br />\nThe wholehearted pursuit of any of the<br />\nactivities that at more normal campuses<br />\nenrich the tone of living--music, theater,<br />\ndance, helping in the community at large-takes on, in the stultifying atmosphere that<br />\nhas evolved here, near-revolutionary consequence.<br />\nVestiges of Sexism<br />\nIt is likely that you will experience, in<br />\nformal and spontaneous behaviors, vestiges<br />\nof the sexism that has prevailed in this<br />\nUniversity for so many years.<br />\nBut sexism, like militarism, educational<br />\nelitism, and technocracy, is one<br />\nmanifestation of a common problem: the<br />\nability of people to capitulate their selfintegrity in response to power plays instigated by undemocratic agencies.<br />\nYou, least of anyone, are responsible for<br />\nthe spiritual torpor on this campus, and no<br />\none in their right mind would expect your<br />\npresence to provide an instant cure. But the<br />\nsame sexism that has kept you off campus<br />\nhas, along with other forms of<br />\ndehumanization, caused great damage to all<br />\naspects of the environment.<br />\nYou cannot be held accountable for solving<br />\nthese problems, but your arrival is a sign<br />\nthat they may finally be confronted with the<br />\nfull dimension of human capability that they<br />\nrequire.<br />\nWelcome.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nCHANGES<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\nI have recently received the<br />\nAlumni Subscription Issue of<br />\nthe New-Letter, announcing<br />\nthat the \"University is<br />\nchanging\" and inviting me to<br />\n\"become informed of what's<br />\nhappening.\"<br />\nHaving read the NewLetter and the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMagazine regularly over the<br />\npast several years, I am all<br />\ntoo well aware of what is<br />\nhappening at the University.<br />\nAnd I am distressed.

It is an area of varied<br />\nlifestyles: rich liberals and conservatives, poor blacks and<br />\nw<br />\norking-class whites.<br />\nSarbanes is backed by labor and<br />\nnational peace groups, while Fallon<br />\nis being<br />\naided by highway contractors throughout the country, as<br />\nhe was in<br />\n1968, when he narrowly<br />\nbeat back a challenge from another<br />\nPeace candidate.<br />\nSarbanes, who first opposed the<br />\nwar in 1968 as<br />\nstate coordinator for<br />\nBobby Kennedy, condemns Fallon's<br />\nsupport of Administration policy.<br />\nFallon responds, \"The President's<br />\nProgram is close<br />\nto the HatfieldMcGovern amendment. He is taking<br />\nthem out in an orderly<br />\nfashion.\"<br />\nThe challenger has also made an<br />\nissue of the highway programs<br />\nwhich Fallon advocates.<br />\nSarbanes asserts that the cities<br />\nmass transist systems, rather<br />\nthan more<br />\nhighways, and he attacks<br />\nFallon's brainchild, the Highway<br />\nTrust Fund, which is the country's<br />\nmain source of transportation<br />\nmoney. Fallon conceived of the<br />\nHighway Trust Fund in 1956 when he<br />\nWas chairman of the roads subcommittee of the Public Works<br /><br />\n(Articles this page written by Art Levine]<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nThe Trust Fund provides 90%<br />\nFederal funding for the Interstate<br />\nHighway System, and the revenue is<br />\ngathered from federal gas taxes,<br />\nand taxes on oil, tires and parts.<br />\nThis Federal largesse far exceeded the usual 50% shares for road<br />\nprojects, and so an expressway<br />\nboom was launched.<br />\nRecently, however, criticism from<br />\nsome quarters has mounted against<br />\nthe Fund for restricting itself only to<br />\nhighways. Sarbanes has attacked<br />\nFallon for opposing a more varied<br />\nuse of the Trust Fund revenues.<br />\n\"I think both mass transit and<br />\nhighways are needed,\" Fallon answers. \"There's no way you can<br />\ndisplace highways. What's good for<br />\nthe national economy is good for the<br />\ncity.\"<br />\nSarbanes also criticizes Fallon for<br />\nthe financial support he receivesfrom<br />\n\"I get conhighway-builders.<br />\ntributions from my friends,\" Fallon<br />\nresponds, \"and some of my friends<br />\nare in industry.\"<br />\nFallon, who became chairman of<br />\nthe Public Works Committee in 1965,<br />\ncontends that the new highways do<br />\nnot hurt the public interest. \"The<br />\npeople who build them, build them<br />\nfor the public,\" he declares. \"The<br />\nonly highway lobby I support are the<br />\nmotorists.\" The 68-year-old Congressman<br />\nfeels that the most important<br />\nproblem facing the country today is<br />\npollution.

Benton, the<br />\nformer chairman of the Department of<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences, was selected<br />\nas the principle administrator (the Dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences) of Homewood.<br />\nHis selection came in the midst of student<br />\nturmoil over the University's involvement in<br />\nwar- related research and the hotly-debated<br />\nand as yet unresolved question of governance of the University.<br />\nThe two problems are related to a third,<br />\nmore basic issue--the gulf that has occurred<br />\nbetween the students and the administrators.<br />\nThe story is often told over coffee or a<br />\nfriendly beer of the time of Dr. Eisenhower<br />\n(Dr. Milton S. Eisenhower, JHU President<br />\n1956-66) and of Dean G. Wilson Shaffer and<br />\nStudent Affairs Director Dr. W. Kelso<br />\nMorrill.<br />\nDr. Morrill, an avid lacrosse fan and<br />\nformer coach and the nemisis and friend of<br />\ndecades of Hopkins undergrads, died in 1967.<br />\nDr. Eisenhower and Dr. Shaffer have<br />\nretired.<br />\nThe story relates that in those days the<br />\nundergraduates were treated as people.<br />\nEach of the three key administrators could<br />\nassociate the names with the faces of over 90<br />\npercent of the students.<br />\nThe personal relationships formed with<br />\nthese men made JHU a better place for those<br />\nstudents who wanted to study and enjoy their<br />\ncollege days.<br />\nIt Was no coincidence that the three administrators made every effort to be with the<br /><br />\nstudents especially in athletic endeavors.<br />\nEach year over 300 undergrads participate<br />\nin intercollegiate athletics, over 400 play on<br />\nintramural teams, over 500 use the gymnasium frequently and most of the rest<br />\nspectate at football, lacrosse or soccer<br />\ncontests.<br />\nThe Eisenhower-Shaffer-Morrill administration knew those students and<br />\nlearned to like most of them. The reverse<br />\nwas also true--the students liked the men<br />\nwho were to them the embodiment of<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nConfrontation politics with its pettiness,<br />\nfear and hatreds were impossible in such an<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nFollowing the Eisenhower era at JHU, the<br />\nDirector of Student Affairs was relegated to<br />\nthe position of a powerless buffer between an<br />\nathletic department with a large number of<br />\nneeds and controversies and the decisionmakers who chose to remain aloof from the<br />\nstudents and their interests.<br />\nDean Benton could change all of that now.<br />\nThe athletic director should report directly<br />\nto the Dean with the almost daily conflicts<br />\nand problems that arise when athletic<br />\nprograms are run with too little money.<br />\nQuestions of policy should be decided by the<br />\nDean who is the person responsible for the<br />\nallocation or withholding of budget funds.<br />\nBut more important than all of the administrative changes, the Dean should learn<br />\nthe names and faces of the majority of the<br />\nstudents and require that his subordinates do<br />\nthe same.<br />\nThe Dean might find that he even likes<br />\nmost of us.<br /><br />\nNCAA to Decide Stick Champ<br /><br />\nSenior quarterback Bob Pfieffer, one-half of Hopkins' one-two<br />\nquarterback punch.<br /><br />\nThis year, the National<br />\nCollegiate<br />\nAthletic<br />\nAssociation voted to accept<br />\nlacrosse as a national sport<br />\nunder its jurisdiction.<br />\nThere will now be a playoff<br />\nsystem similar to the one in<br />\nbasketball.
