Wayne Hood, newly<br />\nappointed director of Financial<br />\nAid stated that there is a<br />\npossibility that the SEOG may be<br />\nin line for a cut-back in funds but<br />\nthat at this point it is difficult to<br />\ndetermine what the affect will be<br />\non the program here.<br />\nThe main question concerns<br />\n\u2022 the extent to which the cut-backs<br />\nmay be carried out and the<br />\ncut-back's legality.<br />\nHood stated that the National<br />\nAssociation of Financial Aid<br />\nDirectors, which represent<br />\nFinancial Aid officers on the<br />\nstate and national levels, see the<br />\nmove as an attempt to limit the<br />\neligibility for the program, and<br />\nthinks it perhaps spells the<br />\nbeginning of the end for SEOG,<br />\nas has occurred in the Office of<br />\nEconomic Opportunity (0E0).<br />\n<br />\nHood stressed that the<br />\ndifficulty has been in responding<br />\nto the change and in measuring<br />\nits effect on the financial aid<br />\npackage that the student receives.<br />\n\"We do not know how to react<br />\nto the situation at this point,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"and we are waiting for a<br />\ncall from National Association of<br />\nFinancial Aid Directors'<br />\nrepresentatives in Washington<br />\nthat will bring us the final word.\"<br />\nThe major problem for Hood's<br />\noffice, however, concerns the<br />\ntime factor involved. The reports<br />\nto the Federal Government must<br />\nbe in by the 10th of November,<br />\nposing special problems for the<br />\nFinancial Aid staff concerning<br />\nthe figures to be used in the<br />\nreports.<br />\n'So that we will not be caught<br />\nunprepared no matter which way<br />\nthe problem ends, we are<br />\npreparing two sets of forms with<br />\ntwo sets of figures.\" Hood said.<br />\n\"One set will request the total<br />\namount of monies that we<br />\ndetermine are necessary for<br />\nfinancial aids, while the other<br />\nwill comply with the<br />\n<br />\ngovernment's request for a 40<br />\npercent deduction. Our main<br />\nconcern is that we protect the<br />\nstudent body regardless of the<br />\npolicy decision.\"<br />\nHood stated that he was<br />\nconfident of the University's<br />\ntotal committment to the<br />\nstudents on all levels of<br />\nadministration, and that meeting<br />\nthe students' needs was a top<br />\npriority.<br />\nHood also stated that the<br />\nrecent changes in the age of<br />\nmajority in many states, as well<br />\nas the lowering of the voting age,<br />\nhad raised questions about filing<br />\nfor aid as a dependent or<br />\nindependent student. The<br />\nFinancial Aid Director stated,<br />\nhowever, that a distinct<br />\nseparation existed between legal<br />\nindependence and financial<br />\nindependence, and that the<br />\nFederal Government had<br />\nformulated strict guidelines<br />\nconcering this distinction.<br />\nAll federal programs have<br />\nstrict definitions as to what<br />\n<br />\nsee AID, page 7<br />\n<br />\nfaith,\" he added.<br />\n\"It seems to me that if the<br />\nUniversity makes a statement on<br />\nrule and regulations, they ought<br />\nto stick to it,\" commented Dr.<br />\nCarl F.

He said of the freshman<br />\npass-fail system, however, \"I'm<br />\nsympathetic to the whole plan.\"<br />\n\"My tentative feeling is that it<br />\nshouldn't be retroactive,\" said<br />\nDr. Alvin Nason, Biology. He<br />\nadded, \"It's a matter of breaking<br />\nfaith with the students.\"<br />\nNason also pointed out, \"I<br />\nthink the first semester is rough<br />\nfor a lot of kids. I think the<br />\noriginal policy is a very<br />\nintelligent and humane<br />\n<br />\npoorly worded with respect to<br />\n'special exceptions.'\"<br />\n\"The system wasn't so much<br />\nchanged as it was misinterpreted<br />\nin Dean Suskind's absence,\"<br />\nexplained Owen.<br />\n\"I realized that this 'special<br />\nexceptions' affair wasn't fair to<br />\nall students,\" continued Suskind.<br />\n'I got together with Dean Owen,<br />\nDr. Dierman, and several faculty<br />\nmembers and we agreed that<br />\nsome action was necessary.

This, he<br />\nasserted, has stifled our inherent<br />\nfeelings, which are cooperative,<br />\nnot competitive, with our fellow<br />\nmankind. As a result, \"we are so<br />\nused to lying and being<br />\nhypocritical that every time we<br />\nlook towards an experience we<br />\ndistort things.\"<br />\nTaking the position of an<br />\nhistorian, Tildon blamed<br />\nalienation on mankind's thirst to<br />\ncontrol the environment and<br />\nforces of society to provide for<br />\n<br />\nhis comforts. Thus, Tildon<br />\ndivided societies into two camps,<br />\nthose which depend on control<br />\nand those which exist on<br />\ncooperation. Because Tildon<br />\nbelieves that man, especially<br />\nAmerican, will inevitably<br />\nprogress from a society of<br />\ncontrol to one of cooperation, he<br />\nreferred to our present society of<br />\ncontrol as the \"Old Regime.\"<br />\n\"This is the reason I am<br />\nagainst Black Panthers, Women's<br />\nLib, and Nixon,\" Tildon asserted,<br />\n\"because these groups seek to<br />\ncontrol, and not cooperate.\"<br />\nTildon explained that in his<br />\nopinion Jesus was the last<br />\nrevolutionist because Jesus'<br />\nrevolution was philosophical in<br />\nnature and not political, being<br />\none of freedom and peace.<br />\nTildon went on to explain the<br />\nmechanism of the \"control<br />\nphilosophy\" by stating that<br />\ncontrol has caused us to separate<br />\nour thought from our fears, our<br />\nreason from our passion. Tildon<br />\nbelieves that when man divided<br />\nhis thoughts from his fears, he<br />\nalso divided his senses. Therefore,<br />\nmen relate to each other only<br />\nthrough sight and sound,<br />\nkeeping his sense of smell, taste<br />\n<br />\nand touch to himself.<br />\n\"Although the sense of hearing<br />\nand seeing are good from the<br />\nphysical world,\" Tildon<br />\nexplained, \"I do not think we are<br />\njust a biochemical bag walking<br />\naround.\"<br />\nDehumanized.<br />\nTo illustrate his argument,<br />\nTildon pointed out instances in<br />\nlife which have become<br />\ndehumanized.<br />\n'Even the ever/day<br />\nexpression, 'It's nothing<br />\n<br />\npersonal', is dehumanizing<br />\nbecause of the inability of man<br />\nto subjectively relate to man.\"<br />\n\"Being human,\" Tildon<br />\nconcluded, \"is to allow for a<br />\nbetter process to experience<br />\nlife.\"<br />\nAlthough the audience was<br />\nreceptive to Tildon's statement<br />\nand conclusions, they did<br />\nquestion certain ambiguities and<br />\nmany times the Socratic method<br />\nwas used to definitively state<br />\ncertain points.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins graduate dies<br />\nFuneral services for Cynthia<br />\nLe Boutillier, 21, who graduated<br />\nfrom Hopkins last spring, were<br />\nheld at the Chapel of the Church<br />\nof the Redeemer at Charles<br />\nStreet and Melrose Avenue<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nMiss Le Boutillier, who lived at<br />\n1015 Poplar Hill Road, died<br />\nSaturday at Union Memorial<br />\nHospital after being struck by a<br />\ncar Friday evening on Art<br />\nMuseum Drive.<br />\nA member of the Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nchapter of Phi Beta Kappa, she<br />\nwas a graduate of the Bryn Mawr<br />\nSchool where she was<br />\nvice-president of its student<br />\ncouncil.<br />\nAfter her graduation, she<br />\nworked as a receptionist for the<br />\nlaw_ firm of Semmes, Bowen and<br />\nSemmes.<br />\nShe is survived by her mother,<br />\nMrs. C.

In making the decision, Suskind not only<br />\nignored consulting students prior to issuing his memo, but<br />\nalso he found the most relevant advice in Amherst,<br />\nMassachusetts from former dean Carl Swanson rather than<br />\nfrom students in Baltimore in whose interests he purported<br />\nhimself to be acting.<br />\nIf Suskind wants to know what the best interests of<br />\nstudents are, we suggest he ask.

These classes were<br />\noperating under the assumption<br />\nthat their grades would not be<br />\nreleased under any circumstances<br />\nwith the possible exceptions of the<br />\n2-5 medical school program or<br />\ntransfer to another institution after<br />\nthe advice offaculty members and<br />\n<br />\nstudent advisors. The question now<br />\n<br />\nstudent.<br />\n<br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nAs members of the faculty, we<br />\nbelieve that first semester freshman<br />\ngrades should continue to be kept<br />\nat least as private as they have been<br />\nsince 1971-72.<br />\nWe very much regret the<br />\nundenied breach of faith on the<br />\npart of the CUS, which has<br />\noverturned that principle<br />\nretroactively. But we further<br />\nbelieve that the crux of the matter<br />\nis not simply one of breach of<br />\nfaith. The issue of whether<br />\nfirst-term grades should remain<br />\nessentially private has to do with<br />\nacademic considerations as well.<br />\nShould not, for example, freshmen<br />\nbe encouraged to experiment in<br />\nselecting their courses during the<br />\nfirst six months at Hopkins? And<br />\ngiven the fact that the grading<br />\nsystem is, at best, a necessary<br />\nexpedience, must it really be<br />\nall-encompassing?<br />\nWe hope that these matters will<br />\nbe given the broadest consideration<br />\nand expect that public forums for<br />\ndiscussing these issues will be set<br />\nup prior to a final decision.<br />\nAs to how that decision might<br />\nbest be made, we respectfully<br />\nsubmit that undergraduate<br />\nstudents participate in deciding the<br />\nmatter of privacy through a<br />\ncampus referendum.<br />\nRichard M.

We feel<br />\nthat it was the most successful<br />\nsocial event of the year. It was<br />\ngeared to both students and<br />\nparents, and effectively<br />\naccommodated both. For the<br />\nparents, it was an etoyable view<br />\nof Hopkins lie, and for the<br />\nstudents a welcome break from<br />\n<br />\nroutine.

In light<br />\nof these facts, we consider the<br />\nattempt of the SIN group to raise<br />\nan issue as a smear campaign, and<br />\nthus we will make no further<br />\ncomment on this incident.<br />\nSteve Bers<br />\nDavid Yaffe<br />\nChairmen Emerti MSE Symposium<br />\n<br />\narises as to whether the University<br />\nhas the obligation to fulfill the<br />\nspirit of the law as stated in the<br />\nUndergraduate Manual. We, the<br />\nundersigned, and many of the<br />\nstudents at this university feel<br />\nstrongly that Johns Hopkins has<br />\nbetrayed the trust placed by these<br />\nclasses in the administration to<br />\nfollow its assumed procedures.<br />\nThis question of the breaking of<br />\nversus the letter of the law. As the<br />\n<br />\nprocedure was stated in the<br />\nUndergraduate Manual, the first<br />\nsemester freshmen grades could be<br />\ntransmitted at the discretion of the<br />\nregistrar and the approval of the<br />\nstudent as illustrated by the<br />\nfollowing examples: a) a transfer<br />\nto another school during or at the<br />\nend of the freshman year, or b)<br />\napplicants for the Johns Hopkins'<br />\n2-5 medical program. This is the<br />\nletter of the law. However, this is<br />\nnot the assumption that the<br />\nfreshmen were working under. The<br />\nfreshmen assumed that their first<br />\nsemester grades would not be<br />\nreleased to anyone outside the<br />\nUniversity except under the<br />\nexamples cited in the<br />\nUndergraduate Manual. This was<br />\nthe spirit of the law and it is this<br />\nspirit under which the entering<br />\nclasses of 1971, 1972 and 1973<br />\nwere operating.<br />\nPurpose,<br />\nThe purpose of this innovation<br />\nwas to relieve the psychological<br />\npressures that are imposed gpon<br />\nthe first semester freshmen. These<br />\npressures arise from the intense<br />\nacademic atmosphere that occurs<br />\nat Hopkins with a majority of<br />\nstudents furthering their education<br />\nat graduate and professional<br />\nschools. Competition for grades<br />\nplaces a severe strain upon<br />\nstudents. with the elimination of<br />\nthese pressures a student will be<br />\nable to adjust to life at Hopkins in<br />\na rational manner.<br />\n<br />\nThe majority of the CUS has<br />\nbased their argument on a situation<br />\nwhich is at this point only a<br />\nhypothetical problem. There has<br />\nbeen no class graduated under this<br />\nsystem. The only first semester<br />\nfreshman grades which have been<br />\ngiven to graduate and professional<br />\nschools have been for those<br />\nstudents who have applied to these<br />\ninstitutions after three years at<br />\n<br />\nThe first semester<br />\ngrades of the entering classes of 1971,<br />\n1972 and 1973 shall<br />\nnot be released except under the following circumstances: 1) application to the Johns<br />\nHopkins 2-5 medical<br />\nprogram and 3-2<br />\n<br />\n)i-om institutions has been very<br />\nlimited. It is not known what the<br />\n<br />\nthe end<br />\n0,110e<br />\n;<br />\n4 dy<br />\n\"i<br />\n;ar<br />\nthe saizThese<br />\n<br />\nresponse of the medical and law<br />\nschools will be. An example similar<br />\nto this problem exists at MIT. MIT<br />\noperates under the system that all<br />\nfreshman grades for the entire year<br />\nwill be kept for the internal use of<br />\nthe University. However, these<br />\ngrades will be released upon the<br />\nrequest of another institution and<br />\nthe consent of the student. Their<br />\nexperience during the three years<br />\nthat this progfam has been in<br />\nexistence was that the only<br />\ninstitution to request information<br />\nconcerning freshman grades in all<br />\ncases of application was The Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical School. The only<br />\nother request received was from<br />\nthe medical school at Tulane<br />\nUniversity. This tends to indicate<br />\nthat there will be no need to<br />\nrelease the freshman grades to<br />\ninstitutions outside the University<br />\nbecause there would be only a<br />\nminimal demand for these grades.<br />\nEmpirical evidence for this<br />\nhypothesis can only be obtained<br />\nby allowing a complete class to<br />\ngraduate under this option. An<br />\nevaluation of the results of<br />\nadmission to graduate and<br />\nprofessional schools could establish<br />\nthe effects of this policy.<br />\nFor the above reasons, in lieu of<br />\nthe recommendation .of the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, the minority members of<br />\nthat Committee suggest that the<br />\nfollowing motion be considered:<br />\n<br />\nmay only be<br />\nreleased with the<br />\nwritten request of<br />\nthe institution and<br />\nthe consent of the<br />\nstudent. These freshman grades shall remain on file for the<br />\ninternal use of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nIn conclusion we feel that the<br />\nabove recommendation will fulfill<br />\nthe obligation of the University to<br />\nkeep intact the trust placed in the<br />\nadministration by the entire<br />\nentering classes of 1971, 1972 and<br />\n1973.

The Hopkins<br />\ndefenders pressured Swarthmore<br />\nall afternoon, forcing four<br />\nfumbles and four interceptions<br />\nthat contributed to the margin.<br />\nIn fact, the first touchdown of<br />\nthe game was scored by defensive<br />\nend Bruce Parker when he<br />\nrecovered a fumble in the end<br />\nzone at the 14:11 mark of the<br />\nsecond quarter.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Blue Jays<br />\novercame a slow start and<br />\nfinished the day with 435 yards,<br />\nwith the ground game<br />\ncontributing more than three<br />\nquarters of that amount.<br />\nFreshman Sam Matz highlighted<br />\nthe Hopkins rushing effort, as he<br />\ngained 131 yards in eighteen<br />\ncarries. Before the day was over,<br />\nhe had his first two college<br />\ntouchdowns and earned the<br />\nteam's offensive back of the<br />\nweek honors.<br />\n\"They changed their defense a<br />\nlittle and it took us a quarter to<br />\nadapt,\" commented Coach<br />\nDennis Cox, referring to<br />\nSwarthmore's tactics. \"They<br />\nworked on outside coverage, so<br />\nMatz and our inside game worked<br />\nwell.\"<br />\n<br />\nOnce the Blue Jays got under<br />\nway, the scoring cannon was kept<br />\nbusy fOr the rest of the<br />\nafternoon, as Hopkins put eight<br />\ntouchdowns on the scoreboard.<br />\nCo-captain Jack Thomas drew<br />\nfirst blood with his fourth field<br />\ngoal of the season, capitalizing on<br />\nBill Norbeck 's first period<br />\ninterception. Parker's recovery<br />\nand short plunges by Matz and<br />\nHarry Stringer gave the Blue Jays<br />\na 24-0 lead with one minute left<br />\nin the half. Swarthmore averted a<br />\nshutout on the kickoff after<br />\nStringer's score, when Chip Veise<br />\nwent all the way for an 87 yard<br />\nreturn.<br />\nThe Blue Jays poured it on in<br />\nthe third quarter, even as Coach<br />\nCox began sprinkling the team<br />\nwith back-up personnel.<br />\nFreshman Scott Smith tallied his<br />\nsecond six pointer in two starts<br />\nto open the second half barrage.<br />\nHis 41 yards on three catches<br />\nmoves him up to third on the<br />\nBlue Jay yardage list for 1973, in<br />\nspite of playing in two and a half<br />\ngames. A five yard reception<br />\nmade the score 31-7 midway<br />\nthrough the stanza. \"Smith<br />\ncontinues to surprise and delight<br />\nthe coaching staff,\" said Cox<br />\nproudly.<br />\nTed Stefaniw then went to<br />\nwork for Hopkins, scoring twice<br />\nin two minutes on runs of nine<br />\nand 21 yards.

Usually a contender<br />\nfor the cellar, the Blue Jays<br />\nmoved up to 11th last year and<br />\ncontinued the dramatic<br />\nimprovement yesterday.<br />\nParticularly satisfying from the<br />\nteam standpoint was the defeat<br />\nof Lebanon Valley and Franklin<br />\n& Marshall: During the regular<br />\nseason, these pair gave Hopkins a<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\nbeat his time against Drexel in<br />\ntaking 40th place with a time of<br />\n29:25, a thirty second<br />\nimprovement.

Bill Schickler had the<br />\nbest improvement of the day<br />\ncutting a full three minutes off<br />\nhis time in finishing 91st.<br />\nCoach Don Masken was quite<br />\nplaced with the race, especially<br />\nthe defeat of F&M, and the<br />\nindividual performances of<br />\nTetzlaff, Kennedy and Schickler.<br />\n\"We're not there yet, but the rest<br />\nof the conference knows we're<br />\ncoming.\"<br />\n<br />\nchampions, winding up on the<br />\nshort end of a 1-0 shutout.<br />\nThe Blue .Jay season record<br />\nnow drops to an even .500 mark<br />\nat 5-5-1 with two games left.<br />\nIronically, all five Blue Jay<br />\ndefeats this season have been<br />\nshutouts.<br />\nThe Sho'men Were out not<br />\nonly to maintain their standing in<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\nbut also to avenge last year's 2-1<br />\nloss to Hopkins in overtime at<br />\nHomewood. For a number of<br />\nyears, the Blue Jay-Sho'men<br />\nbattle has raged on with the game<br />\nusually being decided by one<br />\ngoal. A Sho'men loss would have<br />\nknocked them out of both the<br />\nMAC and the Mason-Dixon<br />\nConference title races.<br />\nLoose Balls<br />\nThe opening minutes of the<br />\ngame saw the Blue Jays a bit<br />\nflatfooted as loose balls were<br />\nbeing picked up by the Sho'men,<br />\nwho maintained control in their<br />\noffensive side of the field. The<br />\nJays, on a number of occasions,<br />\nmaneuvered the ball up field but<br />\ncould not find the secret of<br />\ngetting past the 20-yard mark.<br />\nThe Blue Jay offense just<br />\ncouldn't work it into scoring<br />\nrange. On occasion, when they<br />\nseemed to be in the range, they<br />\nwere hindered by the problem<br />\nthat has plagued Hopkins since<br />\nthe beginning of the season. The<br />\nBlue Jays still have an obsession<br />\nto dribble the ball just one more<br />\nstep before passing or shooting it.<br />\nThe Sho'men scored the<br />\ngame's only goal with 25 minutes<br />\n.gone in the first half.<br />\n<br />\nWashington's Fitzgerald took the<br />\nball down field on the right side<br />\nand crossed it to the Sho'nien's<br />\nsuperstar Williams. He headed the<br />\nball into the net as Hopkins<br />\ngoalie Keith Naunheim was<br />\nunable to get back in position.<br />\nafter cutting the angle on<br />\nFitzgerald's possible shot. The<br />\nSho'men outshot the Jays in the<br />\nfirst half 15-6.<br />\nIn the second half the Blue<br />\nJays controlled the ball much<br />\nmore than in the first half.<br />\nHopkins held the Sho'men to<br />\nonly four shots in the final half<br />\nwhile they took thirteen. But<br />\neven with these shooting<br />\nstatistics, the Jays couldn't put a<br />\nmark on the scoreboard.<br />\n\"Along the lines of the effort<br />\nof the team, which is hard to talk<br />\nabout when you lose, we<br />\ndemonstrated a lot of hustle and<br />\ndetermination. We just didn't<br />\nplay a complete game,\" remarked<br />\nCoach Robert Oliver. \"There was<br />\nthe first half and then there was<br />\nthe second half; we came to life<br />\nin the second half.

Wayne Hood, newly<br />\nappointed director of Financial<br />\nAid stated that there is a<br />\npossibility that the SEOG may be<br />\nin line for a cut-back in funds but<br />\nthat at this point it is difficult to<br />\ndetermine what the affect will be<br />\non the program here.<br />\nThe main question concerns<br />\n\u2022 the extent to which the cut-backs<br />\nmay be carried out and the<br />\ncut-back's legality.<br />\nHood stated that the National<br />\nAssociation of Financial Aid<br />\nDirectors, which represent<br />\nFinancial Aid officers on the<br />\nstate and national levels, see the<br />\nmove as an attempt to limit the<br />\neligibility for the program, and<br />\nthinks it perhaps spells the<br />\nbeginning of the end for SEOG,<br />\nas has occurred in the Office of<br />\nEconomic Opportunity (0E0).<br /><br />\nHood stressed that the<br />\ndifficulty has been in responding<br />\nto the change and in measuring<br />\nits effect on the financial aid<br />\npackage that the student receives.<br />\n\"We do not know how to react<br />\nto the situation at this point,\" he<br />\nsaid, \"and we are waiting for a<br />\ncall from National Association of<br />\nFinancial Aid Directors'<br />\nrepresentatives in Washington<br />\nthat will bring us the final word.\"<br />\nThe major problem for Hood's<br />\noffice, however, concerns the<br />\ntime factor involved.

Our main<br />\nconcern is that we protect the<br />\nstudent body regardless of the<br />\npolicy decision.\"<br />\nHood stated that he was<br />\nconfident of the University's<br />\ntotal committment to the<br />\nstudents on all levels of<br />\nadministration, and that meeting<br />\nthe students' needs was a top<br />\npriority.<br />\nHood also stated that the<br />\nrecent changes in the age of<br />\nmajority in many states, as well<br />\nas the lowering of the voting age,<br />\nhad raised questions about filing<br />\nfor aid as a dependent or<br />\nindependent student. The<br />\nFinancial Aid Director stated,<br />\nhowever, that a distinct<br />\nseparation existed between legal<br />\nindependence and financial<br />\nindependence, and that the<br />\nFederal Government had<br />\nformulated strict guidelines<br />\nconcering this distinction.<br />\nAll federal programs have<br />\nstrict definitions as to what<br /><br />\nsee AID, page 7<br /><br />\nfaith,\" he added.<br />\n\"It seems to me that if the<br />\nUniversity makes a statement on<br />\nrule and regulations, they ought<br />\nto stick to it,\" commented Dr.<br />\nCarl F.

He said of the freshman<br />\npass-fail system, however, \"I'm<br />\nsympathetic to the whole plan.\"<br />\n\"My tentative feeling is that it<br />\nshouldn't be retroactive,\" said<br />\nDr. Alvin Nason, Biology. He<br />\nadded, \"It's a matter of breaking<br />\nfaith with the students.\"<br />\nNason also pointed out, \"I<br />\nthink the first semester is rough<br />\nfor a lot of kids.

This, he<br />\nasserted, has stifled our inherent<br />\nfeelings, which are cooperative,<br />\nnot competitive, with our fellow<br />\nmankind. As a result, \"we are so<br />\nused to lying and being<br />\nhypocritical that every time we<br />\nlook towards an experience we<br />\ndistort things.\"<br />\nTaking the position of an<br />\nhistorian, Tildon blamed<br />\nalienation on mankind's thirst to<br />\ncontrol the environment and<br />\nforces of society to provide for<br /><br />\nhis comforts. Thus, Tildon<br />\ndivided societies into two camps,<br />\nthose which depend on control<br />\nand those which exist on<br />\ncooperation. Because Tildon<br />\nbelieves that man, especially<br />\nAmerican, will inevitably<br />\nprogress from a society of<br />\ncontrol to one of cooperation, he<br />\nreferred to our present society of<br />\ncontrol as the \"Old Regime.\"<br />\n\"This is the reason I am<br />\nagainst Black Panthers, Women's<br />\nLib, and Nixon,\" Tildon asserted,<br />\n\"because these groups seek to<br />\ncontrol, and not cooperate.\"<br />\nTildon explained that in his<br />\nopinion Jesus was the last<br />\nrevolutionist because Jesus'<br />\nrevolution was philosophical in<br />\nnature and not political, being<br />\none of freedom and peace.<br />\nTildon went on to explain the<br />\nmechanism of the \"control<br />\nphilosophy\" by stating that<br />\ncontrol has caused us to separate<br />\nour thought from our fears, our<br />\nreason from our passion. Tildon<br />\nbelieves that when man divided<br />\nhis thoughts from his fears, he<br />\nalso divided his senses. Therefore,<br />\nmen relate to each other only<br />\nthrough sight and sound,<br />\nkeeping his sense of smell, taste<br /><br />\nand touch to himself.<br />\n\"Although the sense of hearing<br />\nand seeing are good from the<br />\nphysical world,\" Tildon<br />\nexplained, \"I do not think we are<br />\njust a biochemical bag walking<br />\naround.\"<br />\nDehumanized.<br />\nTo illustrate his argument,<br />\nTildon pointed out instances in<br />\nlife which have become<br />\ndehumanized.<br />\n'Even the ever/day<br />\nexpression, 'It's nothing<br /><br />\npersonal', is dehumanizing<br />\nbecause of the inability of man<br />\nto subjectively relate to man.\"<br />\n\"Being human,\" Tildon<br />\nconcluded, \"is to allow for a<br />\nbetter process to experience<br />\nlife.\"<br />\nAlthough the audience was<br />\nreceptive to Tildon's statement<br />\nand conclusions, they did<br />\nquestion certain ambiguities and<br />\nmany times the Socratic method<br />\nwas used to definitively state<br />\ncertain points.<br /><br />\nHopkins graduate dies<br />\nFuneral services for Cynthia<br />\nLe Boutillier, 21, who graduated<br />\nfrom Hopkins last spring, were<br />\nheld at the Chapel of the Church<br />\nof the Redeemer at Charles<br />\nStreet and Melrose Avenue<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nMiss Le Boutillier, who lived at<br />\n1015 Poplar Hill Road, died<br />\nSaturday at Union Memorial<br />\nHospital after being struck by a<br />\ncar Friday evening on Art<br />\nMuseum Drive.<br />\nA member of the Hopkins<br /><br />\nchapter of Phi Beta Kappa, she<br />\nwas a graduate of the Bryn Mawr<br />\nSchool where she was<br />\nvice-president of its student<br />\ncouncil.<br />\nAfter her graduation, she<br />\nworked as a receptionist for the<br />\nlaw_ firm of Semmes, Bowen and<br />\nSemmes.<br />\nShe is survived by her mother,<br />\nMrs. C.

These classes were<br />\noperating under the assumption<br />\nthat their grades would not be<br />\nreleased under any circumstances<br />\nwith the possible exceptions of the<br />\n2-5 medical school program or<br />\ntransfer to another institution after<br />\nthe advice offaculty members and<br /><br />\nstudent advisors.

But we further<br />\nbelieve that the crux of the matter<br />\nis not simply one of breach of<br />\nfaith. The issue of whether<br />\nfirst-term grades should remain<br />\nessentially private has to do with<br />\nacademic considerations as well.<br />\nShould not, for example, freshmen<br />\nbe encouraged to experiment in<br />\nselecting their courses during the<br />\nfirst six months at Hopkins? And<br />\ngiven the fact that the grading<br />\nsystem is, at best, a necessary<br />\nexpedience, must it really be<br />\nall-encompassing?<br />\nWe hope that these matters will<br />\nbe given the broadest consideration<br />\nand expect that public forums for<br />\ndiscussing these issues will be set<br />\nup prior to a final decision.<br />\nAs to how that decision might<br />\nbest be made, we respectfully<br />\nsubmit that undergraduate<br />\nstudents participate in deciding the<br />\nmatter of privacy through a<br />\ncampus referendum.<br />\nRichard M.

In light<br />\nof these facts, we consider the<br />\nattempt of the SIN group to raise<br />\nan issue as a smear campaign, and<br />\nthus we will make no further<br />\ncomment on this incident.<br />\nSteve Bers<br />\nDavid Yaffe<br />\nChairmen Emerti MSE Symposium<br /><br />\narises as to whether the University<br />\nhas the obligation to fulfill the<br />\nspirit of the law as stated in the<br />\nUndergraduate Manual. We, the<br />\nundersigned, and many of the<br />\nstudents at this university feel<br />\nstrongly that Johns Hopkins has<br />\nbetrayed the trust placed by these<br />\nclasses in the administration to<br />\nfollow its assumed procedures.<br />\nThis question of the breaking of<br />\nversus the letter of the law. As the<br /><br />\nprocedure was stated in the<br />\nUndergraduate Manual, the first<br />\nsemester freshmen grades could be<br />\ntransmitted at the discretion of the<br />\nregistrar and the approval of the<br />\nstudent as illustrated by the<br />\nfollowing examples: a) a transfer<br />\nto another school during or at the<br />\nend of the freshman year, or b)<br />\napplicants for the Johns Hopkins'<br />\n2-5 medical program. This is the<br />\nletter of the law. However, this is<br />\nnot the assumption that the<br />\nfreshmen were working under. The<br />\nfreshmen assumed that their first<br />\nsemester grades would not be<br />\nreleased to anyone outside the<br />\nUniversity except under the<br />\nexamples cited in the<br />\nUndergraduate Manual. This was<br />\nthe spirit of the law and it is this<br />\nspirit under which the entering<br />\nclasses of 1971, 1972 and 1973<br />\nwere operating.<br />\nPurpose,<br />\nThe purpose of this innovation<br />\nwas to relieve the psychological<br />\npressures that are imposed gpon<br />\nthe first semester freshmen. These<br />\npressures arise from the intense<br />\nacademic atmosphere that occurs<br />\nat Hopkins with a majority of<br />\nstudents furthering their education<br />\nat graduate and professional<br />\nschools. Competition for grades<br />\nplaces a severe strain upon<br />\nstudents. with the elimination of<br />\nthese pressures a student will be<br />\nable to adjust to life at Hopkins in<br />\na rational manner.<br /><br />\nThe majority of the CUS has<br />\nbased their argument on a situation<br />\nwhich is at this point only a<br />\nhypothetical problem. There has<br />\nbeen no class graduated under this<br />\nsystem. The only first semester<br />\nfreshman grades which have been<br />\ngiven to graduate and professional<br />\nschools have been for those<br />\nstudents who have applied to these<br />\ninstitutions after three years at<br /><br />\nThe first semester<br />\ngrades of the entering classes of 1971,<br />\n1972 and 1973 shall<br />\nnot be released except under the following circumstances: 1) application to the Johns<br />\nHopkins 2-5 medical<br />\nprogram and 3-2<br /><br />\n)i-om institutions has been very<br />\nlimited. It is not known what the<br /><br />\nthe end<br />\n0,110e<br />\n;<br />\n4 dy<br />\n\"i<br />\n;ar<br />\nthe saizThese<br /><br />\nresponse of the medical and law<br />\nschools will be. An example similar<br />\nto this problem exists at MIT. MIT<br />\noperates under the system that all<br />\nfreshman grades for the entire year<br />\nwill be kept for the internal use of<br />\nthe University. However, these<br />\ngrades will be released upon the<br />\nrequest of another institution and<br />\nthe consent of the student. Their<br />\nexperience during the three years<br />\nthat this progfam has been in<br />\nexistence was that the only<br />\ninstitution to request information<br />\nconcerning freshman grades in all<br />\ncases of application was The Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical School. The only<br />\nother request received was from<br />\nthe medical school at Tulane<br />\nUniversity. This tends to indicate<br />\nthat there will be no need to<br />\nrelease the freshman grades to<br />\ninstitutions outside the University<br />\nbecause there would be only a<br />\nminimal demand for these grades.<br />\nEmpirical evidence for this<br />\nhypothesis can only be obtained<br />\nby allowing a complete class to<br />\ngraduate under this option. An<br />\nevaluation of the results of<br />\nadmission to graduate and<br />\nprofessional schools could establish<br />\nthe effects of this policy.<br />\nFor the above reasons, in lieu of<br />\nthe recommendation .of the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, the minority members of<br />\nthat Committee suggest that the<br />\nfollowing motion be considered:<br /><br />\nmay only be<br />\nreleased with the<br />\nwritten request of<br />\nthe institution and<br />\nthe consent of the<br />\nstudent. These freshman grades shall remain on file for the<br />\ninternal use of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nIn conclusion we feel that the<br />\nabove recommendation will fulfill<br />\nthe obligation of the University to<br />\nkeep intact the trust placed in the<br />\nadministration by the entire<br />\nentering classes of 1971, 1972 and<br />\n1973. While we object to the<br />\ncontinuation of the policy as<br />\nadopted by the CUS concerning<br />\nfirst semester freshman grades, we<br />\nwholeheartedly support the<br />\nrecommendation to appoint<br />\nsubcommittee to study this<br />\nproblem in relation to future<br />\nentering classes at Hopkins.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nRobert Gray<br />\nDaniel Holik<br /><br />\n(This is the dissenting report ofthe<br />\nminority members of the CUS<br />\nconcerning freshman pass-fail 1st<br />\nsemester.

The Hopkins<br />\ndefenders pressured Swarthmore<br />\nall afternoon, forcing four<br />\nfumbles and four interceptions<br />\nthat contributed to the margin.<br />\nIn fact, the first touchdown of<br />\nthe game was scored by defensive<br />\nend Bruce Parker when he<br />\nrecovered a fumble in the end<br />\nzone at the 14:11 mark of the<br />\nsecond quarter.<br />\nMeanwhile, the Blue Jays<br />\novercame a slow start and<br />\nfinished the day with 435 yards,<br />\nwith the ground game<br />\ncontributing more than three<br />\nquarters of that amount.<br />\nFreshman Sam Matz highlighted<br />\nthe Hopkins rushing effort, as he<br />\ngained 131 yards in eighteen<br />\ncarries. Before the day was over,<br />\nhe had his first two college<br />\ntouchdowns and earned the<br />\nteam's offensive back of the<br />\nweek honors.<br />\n\"They changed their defense a<br />\nlittle and it took us a quarter to<br />\nadapt,\" commented Coach<br />\nDennis Cox, referring to<br />\nSwarthmore's tactics. \"They<br />\nworked on outside coverage, so<br />\nMatz and our inside game worked<br />\nwell.\"<br /><br />\nOnce the Blue Jays got under<br />\nway, the scoring cannon was kept<br />\nbusy fOr the rest of the<br />\nafternoon, as Hopkins put eight<br />\ntouchdowns on the scoreboard.<br />\nCo-captain Jack Thomas drew<br />\nfirst blood with his fourth field<br />\ngoal of the season, capitalizing on<br />\nBill Norbeck 's first period<br />\ninterception. Parker's recovery<br />\nand short plunges by Matz and<br />\nHarry Stringer gave the Blue Jays<br />\na 24-0 lead with one minute left<br />\nin the half.

A five yard reception<br />\nmade the score 31-7 midway<br />\nthrough the stanza. \"Smith<br />\ncontinues to surprise and delight<br />\nthe coaching staff,\" said Cox<br />\nproudly.<br />\nTed Stefaniw then went to<br />\nwork for Hopkins, scoring twice<br />\nin two minutes on runs of nine<br />\nand 21 yards.

Usually a contender<br />\nfor the cellar, the Blue Jays<br />\nmoved up to 11th last year and<br />\ncontinued the dramatic<br />\nimprovement yesterday.<br />\nParticularly satisfying from the<br />\nteam standpoint was the defeat<br />\nof Lebanon Valley and Franklin<br />\n&amp; Marshall: During the regular<br />\nseason, these pair gave Hopkins a<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nf<br /><br />\nbeat his time against Drexel in<br />\ntaking 40th place with a time of<br />\n29:25, a thirty second<br />\nimprovement. Junior Jon Higdon<br />\ntook 76th in 31:01. Freshman<br />\nRandy Safier lowered his time on<br />\nthe grueling 5.2 mile course by<br />\nalmost a minute in taking 81st in<br />\nthe race.

For a number of<br />\nyears, the Blue Jay-Sho'men<br />\nbattle has raged on with the game<br />\nusually being decided by one<br />\ngoal. A Sho'men loss would have<br />\nknocked them out of both the<br />\nMAC and the Mason-Dixon<br />\nConference title races.<br />\nLoose Balls<br />\nThe opening minutes of the<br />\ngame saw the Blue Jays a bit<br />\nflatfooted as loose balls were<br />\nbeing picked up by the Sho'men,<br />\nwho maintained control in their<br />\noffensive side of the field. The<br />\nJays, on a number of occasions,<br />\nmaneuvered the ball up field but<br />\ncould not find the secret of<br />\ngetting past the 20-yard mark.<br />\nThe Blue Jay offense just<br />\ncouldn't work it into scoring<br />\nrange. On occasion, when they<br />\nseemed to be in the range, they<br />\nwere hindered by the problem<br />\nthat has plagued Hopkins since<br />\nthe beginning of the season. The<br />\nBlue Jays still have an obsession<br />\nto dribble the ball just one more<br />\nstep before passing or shooting it.<br />\nThe Sho'men scored the<br />\ngame's only goal with 25 minutes<br />\n.gone in the first half.<br /><br />\nWashington's Fitzgerald took the<br />\nball down field on the right side<br />\nand crossed it to the Sho'nien's<br />\nsuperstar Williams. He headed the<br />\nball into the net as Hopkins<br />\ngoalie Keith Naunheim was<br />\nunable to get back in position.<br />\nafter cutting the angle on<br />\nFitzgerald's possible shot. The<br />\nSho'men outshot the Jays in the<br />\nfirst half 15-6.<br />\nIn the second half the Blue<br />\nJays controlled the ball much<br />\nmore than in the first half.<br />\nHopkins held the Sho'men to<br />\nonly four shots in the final half<br />\nwhile they took thirteen. But<br />\neven with these shooting<br />\nstatistics, the Jays couldn't put a<br />\nmark on the scoreboard.<br />\n\"Along the lines of the effort<br />\nof the team, which is hard to talk<br />\nabout when you lose, we<br />\ndemonstrated a lot of hustle and<br />\ndetermination.
