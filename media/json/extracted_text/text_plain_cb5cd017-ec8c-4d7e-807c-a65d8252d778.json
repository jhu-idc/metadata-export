The cast call was<br />\nopen although postering was<br />\ndone on the Homewood campus and an ad was placed in the<br />\nNews-Letter.

The<br />\nfilm is directed by Steve Yeager,<br />\nalso of Baltimore.<br />\nSchnydman said that reflecting the diversity of the student<br />\nbody of Hopkins was \"not<br />\npossible with three people\" in<br />\nthe principal roles.

Thus the film serves to<br />\ncreate \"greater exposure\" said<br />\nSchnydman by bringing the<br />\ncampus to the prospective<br />\nstudent.<br />\nThe film will be released<br />\nthrough a distributing company<br />\nthat supplies high schools with<br />\npromotional films and viewing<br />\nequipment.

The<br />\n<br />\nfilms will also be available to<br />\nalumni who interview students.<br />\nIn addition, it will be shown in<br />\nthe admissions office.<br />\nThe film is expected to be<br />\nready by the end of June, according to Schnydman. The<br />\nprojected duration of the film's<br />\nusefulness reported to Schnydman is four or five years. No<br />\nfigures could be attained on the<br />\ncost of the film to the University, but Schnydman did say it<br />\nwas \"less costly\" than the prospectus revised and published<br />\nyearly. The prospectus is the<br />\nbooklet containing both<br />\nliterature on the campus and<br />\n<br />\nthe application for admission.<br />\nSchnydman sees this as cost effective as the film will be a one<br />\ntime incurred cost that will be<br />\nuseful over a period of years.<br />\nThere will be one more day<br />\nof shooting for The Official<br />\nStory on Monday, May 5, due<br />\nto rain during the initial week<br />\nof shooting.

Other momentary<br />\n\"Scandals of the Decade\" have now<br />\nbeen forgotten, while some issues have<br />\ngrown far larger than anyone ever<br />\nthought they would.<br />\nSo in the name of a brief year-end<br />\nreview, allow us to reprint a few of our<br />\nthoughts from throughout the year.<br />\nSome of these issues are major, some are<br />\nminor; they all reflect (in one way or<br />\nanother) on Hopkins. Here, then, our<br />\n.collected wisdom\u2014or lack thereof:<br />\n<br />\nmonths. It's now been 22.<br />\n\"Worst of all, it's clear in retrospect<br />\nthat the administration simply lied<br />\nthrough its teeth. It's obvious that the<br />\npeople who run Hopkins haven't<br />\ndistinguished themselves in the WJHU<br />\naffair, but surely the University's top officers are not so stupid that they sincerely<br />\nestimated a two-year job could be completed in three months.<br />\n\"The administration's record is hardly<br />\none of striking efficiency, but WJHU has<br />\nbecome the piece de resistance of<br />\nbumbling.\"<br />\nSouth Africa: \"The mission of the<br />\nUniversity extends beyond financial wellbeing. Hopkins ought also to stand for<br />\ncertain values\u2014values which are surely<br />\nbeing violated in South Africa.. . .The<br />\nUniversity ought to divest.\"<br />\nThe Student Referendum: \"If, as the<br />\nold saying goes, close only counts in<br />\nhorseshoes and hand grenades, then even<br />\nactually winning may not always count<br />\nin politics.<br />\n\"At least that's the way the pro-South<br />\nAfrican divestment forces must be feeling after Tuesday's student referendum.<br />\nThey may have won the vote, but<br />\nevidently they didn't do so convincingly<br />\nenough to win over the Student Council.<br />\n\"The referendum was called, council<br />\nmembers said two weeks ago, to gauge<br />\nstudent feeling on the issue of South<br />\nAfrican investments.<br />\n\"And yet, despite the endorsement of<br />\ndivestment by the student body, the<br />\ncouncil refused to sign the so-called<br />\n'Points of Unity' the Hopkins Coalition<br />\nfor a Free South Africa has been<br />\npushing.<br />\n\"Having quite rightly declared the<br />\nmatter beyond its competence, the council had referred the issue to the voters.<br />\nIt should have listened to what they<br />\nsaid.\"<br />\nAnd, finally, Commemoration Day:<br />\n\"When the faculty and the Trustees and<br />\nt hose ever-present 'distinguished<br />\nguests' all get together later today to<br />\ncommemorate the 110th anniversary of<br />\nthe University, everybody will no doubt<br />\nbe cheerful and happy and optimistic and<br />\nsay wonderful things about this great institution that stands at the forefront of<br />\nAmerican higher education and is a<br />\nleader in research efforts and was the<br />\nfirst true university in America and is a<br />\nmonument to the legacy of Johns<br />\nHopkins and fields a great lacrosse team<br />\nand has a really neat clock tower<br />\nand<br />\n\"Well, we have a word of cau- tion<br />\n. Hopkins may well be a highlyrespected pillar of academe, but it is also<br />\na university in dire need of a thorough<br />\nre-evaluation.<br />\n`bur point is that resting on our<br />\nprestigious name won't do anyone any<br />\ngood. Instead, we must all candidly<br />\nassess the University's(many) problems,<br />\nand seek ways to solve them.\"<br />\n<br />\nFall Break: \"Jon Savitz and Mark<br />\nGoodman must feel rejected: they gave<br />\na Fall Break and nobody came.<br />\n\"The problem is that attendance was<br />\npitiful at most of the events. . . . Given a<br />\nthree-day weekend, Hopkins students<br />\ndid what college students anywhere<br />\nwould have done\u2014go home, get some<br />\ngood food and clean clothes and escape<br />\nthe drudgeries of campus.<br />\n\"Savitz says thoughtfully that if a<br />\nsocial weekend' of some sort is held<br />\nduring the fall in future years, it ought<br />\nto be moved off of the Fall Break<br />\nweekend. He's right.\"<br />\nThe MCAT: \"When the University<br />\nannounced last May that it will no longer<br />\nrequire the MCAT as part .of medical<br />\nschool applications, it took a step in the<br />\nright direction.<br />\n\"But while [University President<br />\nSteven] Muller deserves a pat on the<br />\nback, he\u2014and, more importantly, the<br />\nmedical school faculty\u2014also deserves a<br />\nnudge in the rear . . ..The University<br />\nmust now take a much more important<br />\nstep: the medical school should disregard<br />\nthe MCAT.<br />\nIntersession: \"Make teaching an Intersession course periodically\u2014say every<br />\nthree or four years\u2014a part of faculty<br />\nmembers' jobs. Obviously, this couldn't<br />\nbe hoisted on people who are already<br />\nhere without paying them more, so we<br />\nsuggest a 'grandfather clause.' Whenever<br />\na new faculty member is hired, make Intersession teaching a requirement.\"<br />\nThe Food Contract: \"Everyone knows<br />\nthat ARA's food can be hard to swallow,<br />\nbut until last week nobody realized their<br />\nprices were too.<br />\n\"It seems, though, that under certain<br />\n(very likely) circumstances, students can<br />\nend up paying more for their meals if<br />\nthey buy the semester-long meal plan<br />\nthan if they buy their meals individually.<br />\n\"There can be no argument that this<br />\nyear's meal plan has labored under a<br />\nludicrous pricing scheme. There isn't<br />\nmuch that can be done about that now,<br />\nbut the administration ought to make<br />\nsure that a little common sense is<br />\nemployed in the future.\"<br />\nWJHU:\"Way back in April of 1984,<br />\nwhen WJHU was first taken off the air<br />\nto accomodate the renovations of AMR<br />\nIndeed, we couldn't have said it betII, we were all told the station would<br />\nreturn\u2014at 25,000 watts\u2014in about three ter ourselves.<br />\n<br />\nMany people in this school<br />\ndon't have the faintest idea of<br />\nhow our student government<br />\nworks.

The job of a<br />\nrepresentative entails going to<br />\n<br />\nfew people took the time to investigate the validity of these<br />\nposters. When something bad is<br />\nsaid about a person everyone is<br />\nready to believe it, but when<br />\nsomething good is said people<br />\nusually have a harder time<br />\nbelieving it.<br />\n<br />\ncrick santos<br />\nevery meeting, keeping council<br />\noffice hours (something which<br />\nis not taken seriously by many<br />\nof the elected officers) and<br />\nrepresenting the class.

Few people<br />\nknow that the council meetings<br />\nare open to any student who<br />\nwishes to go to them. The only<br />\ndifference between a student<br />\nwho goes to council meetings<br />\nand a rep is the vote the rep has.<br />\nIf more people went to council<br />\nmeetings, they would see what<br />\nthe views of his elected officers<br />\nare and who speaks up and asks<br />\neffective questions when important issues are being discussed.<br />\nMost of the business that requires a vote in the council is<br />\nexpenditures that are budgeted<br />\nsince the beginning of the year.<br />\nThe real work of the council is<br />\ndone in committees and the real<br />\ncontributions are made by the<br />\nwork put into committees.<br />\nDuring these past elections<br />\nnobody seemed to know what<br />\nthe real job of a rep was. People in the freshman class let<br />\nthemselves be convinced about<br />\nthe job I did as a rep by a few<br />\nposters with negative campaigns against me, while very<br />\n<br />\nMy record this year as a rep<br />\nwas as good or better than any<br />\nof the other reps in council.<br />\nAnyone who is interested can<br />\nask any of this year's council<br />\nofficers. If people would be<br />\nmore conscious of the actions<br />\nof their officers then maybe the<br />\n<br />\nMy record this<br />\nyear as a rep was<br />\nas good or better<br />\nthan any of the<br />\nother reps in<br />\ncouncil.<br />\nresults of the elections would<br />\nhave been different.<br />\nOne of the main problems<br />\nfacing the council is to communicate all of the information<br />\ngiven to the reps. Very few reps<br />\ntried to find out the opinions of<br />\nthe people who elected them.<br />\nReps who are committed to<br />\ntheir job should try to do more<br />\nof this communication. I am<br />\nguilty of not being more effective in this communication, but<br />\nI thought my work would stand<br />\nfor itself.<br />\nIf there is one lesson to be<br />\nlearned about what happened<br />\nto me in the last election it is<br />\nthis: Don't work hard, it won't<br />\nhelp much if you get slandered<br />\nand don't be controversial or<br />\noutspoken in meetings because<br />\nyou may make some enemies in<br />\nyour class.<br />\nTo conclude, I wish the best<br />\nof luck to all the officers who<br />\nwere elected this year\u2014that is<br />\nwhat you will need to get reelected.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins News,Letter<br />\nEthan Rarick<br />\nEditor<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nMary Cinder<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\n(den Weiss<br />\nProduction Manager<br />\nTimothy McNamara, A.J.

This process is apparently facilitated by the presence of<br />\na supportive homosexual subculture. Since homosexuality<br />\nitself is not considered a mental disorder, the factors that<br />\npredispose to homosexuality<br />\nare not included in this section.<br />\nThe factors that predispose to<br />\nEgo-dystonic Homosexuality<br />\nare those negative societal attitudes toward homosexuality<br />\nthat have been internalized.<br />\nThese quotes are from the<br />\nDiagnostic and Statistical<br />\nManual of Mental Disorders,<br />\nThird Edition, pages 281-282.<br />\nLastly, there have been only<br />\ntwo articles in the News-Letter<br />\nabout GALA in over two years!<br />\nI do not consider this to be excessive publicity.<br />\nChances are, you know someone who is gay whether or not<br />\nhe has told you about it, since<br />\nhomosexuals comprise about 10<br />\npercent of the population.

Because homosexuals<br />\nare in the minority, there is a<br />\nneed for the group to be explicitly recognized; those in the<br />\nmajority, like heterosexuals or<br />\nCaucasians, have less difficulty finding others who share<br />\ntheir perspectives (at least in<br />\nthose respects). The formation<br />\nof a heterosexual group\u2014or a<br />\nwhite Anglo-Saxon Protestant<br />\ngroup\u2014would be ludricrous.<br />\nFinally, I would point out<br />\nthat the News-Letter and the<br />\nSAC are doing what they can<br />\nfor student life: a group of<br />\nstudents has asked for support,<br />\nand they have provided it.

The Barnstormers have been blessed this<br />\ntime around with a very serious<br />\ntheatre student, Carol Gerry,<br />\nwho is taking the directing<br />\nmils.

The bulk of the play,<br />\nhowever, deals with a whole<br />\nbunch of sets of lovers and<br />\nsome fairy mischief. Hermia<br />\n(Joanne Howell) is being forced to marry Demetrius (Louis<br />\nKlieman) but she really loves<br />\nLysander (Scott McNamee),<br />\n<br />\nand Helena (Kathy Kennedy)<br />\nreally loves Demetrius, though<br />\nhe could care less. Somehow<br />\nthey all find their way into the<br />\nfairy woods (the fairies have<br />\napparently come from India for<br />\nthe big wedding) and some<br />\ngreat complications ensue, a<br />\nproduct of the little hobgoblin,<br />\nPuck (Kelli Midgley), and some<br />\nmagic love juice. You see, Puck<br />\nis the servant of the fairy-king,<br />\n<br />\nOberon (Rich Bigelow), who is<br />\nhaving a spat with his wife<br />\nTitania (Chrissie Stanfel). He<br />\nwants the love juice in order to<br />\nembarass her by making her fall<br />\nin love with some monstrosity\u2014<br />\nwhich turns out to be an assheaded (literally) local weaver<br />\nnamed Bottom (Greg Harmon).<br />\nEtcetera. . .<br />\nGerry hints that the scenes<br />\nwith the fairies should be<br />\n<br />\nespecially flashy, even though<br />\nthe play itself will be staged<br />\nsomewhat minimally due to the<br />\nconstraints of the L/V stage<br />\n(and an SAC budget, I assume).<br />\nNevertheless, the forest scenes<br />\nwill be fascinating due to a<br />\ndeceptively simple yet effective<br />\nstage design. You'll see what I<br />\nmean. Furthermore, although<br />\nGerry is quick to point out that<br />\nA Midsummer-night's Dream is<br />\nessentially a fun, light play, she<br />\nfeels that this production will<br />\nbring out some of the darker<br />\nelements in the play as well.<br />\nIf this production is a success, and the signs point toward<br />\nthat, perhaps the future of the<br />\nBarnstormers lies in a more<br />\nserious direction. Let's face it,<br />\neven though Godspell ultimately was a pretty good show, any<br />\ngroup of pre-teens anywhere<br />\ncould put on a convincing performance of that musical.

In<br />\nanother two or three years the<br />\nBarnstormers could be turning<br />\n'Baltimore on its ear.

Knopf, $18.95. 475<br />\npages.<br />\nby Cliff Robinson<br />\nIn A Perfect Spy, John<br />\nLeCarre has brought his<br />\nreaders a complicated, very<br />\nemotional story of betrayal and<br />\nsearches on several levels.<br />\nMoreover, A Perfect Spy tells<br />\nof Magnus Pym, senior British<br />\nIntelligence operative, who<br />\ndisappears after the death of his<br />\nfather. Taking a lifetime of<br />\nsecrets with him, Pym embarks<br />\non a journey through his own<br />\nlife's story, trying to find his<br />\ntrue \"self\"\u2014a part of him that<br />\nis genuine, and not just a cover<br />\nfor one of his numerous<br />\nbetrayals.<br />\nLeCarre's main characters<br />\nalways seem to be tormented,<br />\nand are usually involved in<br />\nsome kind of search for their<br />\nown identity. Like the heroine<br />\nin The Little Drummer Girl, or<br />\nGeorge Smiley in Smiley's People, the lives of LeCarre's<br />\ncharacters are somehow in-<br />\n<br />\ncomplete, and they look for<br />\nsomething to fill the gap.<br />\nUsually, however, that search is<br />\nsecondary to the main action of<br />\nthe novel. In A Perfect Spy,<br />\nMagnus Pym's search for<br />\nhimself is the primary focus of<br />\nthe plot. The main aspect of the<br />\nbook, the development of<br />\nMagnus Pym's character, is<br />\nespecially well done. Pym is<br />\nrevealed as a man with no close<br />\npersonal involvements, no<br />\ndiscernable loyalty to anyone.<br />\nHe also has no true character,<br />\nno driving focus or goals\u2014he<br />\ndoes not know who he is, and<br />\nneither does anyone else. While<br />\nthis may make him a \"perfect<br />\nspy,\" it also makes him a deeply troubled man, one in search<br />\nof a mission, a cause, or an<br />\nidentity.<br />\nWhen we are first introduced<br />\nto Magnus, we see a man who<br />\nis warm, effusive, well-liked by<br />\neveryone he knows and loved<br />\nby many. He is able to be many<br />\nthings to many people, and virtually everyone has a slightly<br />\ndifferent impression of him.<br />\nYet while many love Magnus,<br />\nno one is truly close to him. His<br />\nwife and he seem to have a<br />\n<br />\nbeautiful relationship, which<br />\neveryone admires, but she<br />\ndoesn't share his secrets. Nor<br />\ndo his agents or colleagues in<br />\nBritish Intelligence really<br />\nunderstand him.<br />\nThis ability to change<br />\n\"masks\" so readily makes him<br />\nan ideal spy, but behind Pym's<br />\nmasks, there is nothing. We<br />\nsoon realize, as does Magnus,<br />\nthat his entire being is devoted<br />\nto the expression of countless<br />\nsuperficial identities\u2014he cannot find a private self apart<br />\nfrom his facades.<br />\nskillfully<br />\nLeCarre<br />\ndemonstrates this as Magnus<br />\nwrites to his son Tom, telling<br />\nhim about his life. Almost exclusively, Magnus refers to<br />\nhimself as Pym, especially<br />\nwhen he is acting in an assumed<br />\nidentity, even with his family.<br />\nThe only time he says \"I\" is if<br />\nhe speaks of a deeply meaningful, important event, and<br />\nthen only with great emotion.<br />\nThe fact that \"I\" appears so infrequently shows that any part<br />\nof him which feels deeply, or<br />\ntruly cares about anything, is<br />\nvery small and hidden amid the<br />\nmasks of faces which make up<br />\n<br />\nhis \"covers.\" There is little left<br />\nof the true Magnus Pym. As<br />\nanother agent says to him,<br />\n\"Magnus, you are the perfect<br />\nspy. Now all you need is a<br />\nmission.\"<br />\nIt is the search for this mission that causes Magnus to<br />\ndisappear, and begin a journey<br />\nthrough his past. \"Sometimes<br />\nour actions are questions, not<br />\nanswers,\" he says, and calls his<br />\ndisappearance \"The first conscious decision I ever made in<br />\nmy life.\" As he unravels the<br />\nthreads of his life, his<br />\nchildhood is shown to be a<br />\ntraining ground for a lifetime of<br />\nbetrayals, hidden meanings and<br />\nintrigue. At the same time,<br />\nBritish Intelligence is looking<br />\nfor him, and trying to understand him and his motives.<br />\nGradually, they both begin to<br />\nrealize that for his whole life,<br />\nhis lack of conscious decisions<br />\nis a result of his not having a<br />\ncause to be loyal to, a single<br />\nperson to care about, or any<br />\ndriving force behind his actions. He becomes enmeshed in<br />\na circle of duplicity, with double agents whose loyalty is constantly in question. His rela-<br />\n<br />\ntionship with his wife parallels<br />\nhis career, and his loyalty to his<br />\ncountry, and again he is unwilling, or unable, to make a strong<br />\ncommitment.<br />\nTo a large extent, Pym's<br />\nsearch goes unresolved. Even at<br />\nthe end of the book, questions<br />\nstill remain about the ultimate<br />\nmotives of both Pym and some<br />\nof the agents he is involved<br />\nwith. We are not sure if he intended to betray those things he<br />\nthought were important for<br />\nsome greater cause. He may<br />\nlove his country, his father, his<br />\nson. Or he may still have no<br />\nloyalty, not even to himself. It<br />\nseems that he himself is unsure,<br />\nas if LeCarre wishes to avoid<br />\nmaking any statement about<br />\nthe final value of commitments.<br />\nInstead, we just see that all<br />\nPym's relationships are based<br />\nupon deceit. Pym says, \"Love<br />\nis what you have left to<br />\nbetray,\" so it may very well be<br />\nthat he loves most what he<br />\nbetrays. It does not matter<br />\nultimately, for when all the interpretations are stripped away,<br />\nA Perfect Spy is still an excellent spy novel, and wellrecommended.<br />\n<br />\n\f12/MAY 2, 1986<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nContinued from Page 11<br />\n<br />\nof South Africa's arms come<br />\nfrom France or Italy, funneled<br />\nSouth African people and arms through by European or Arab<br />\nSouth Africa with both conven- states.

The food<br />\narrived in generous portions.<br />\nThe Sour Beef was tender but<br />\nsmothered in a large amount of<br />\ngravy which was a little too<br />\nsweet. The dumplings were<br />\nsimilar in flavor and a bit<br />\nbland. The eggplant, however,<br />\n<br />\nwas tasty.<br />\nThe Wiener Schnitzel(breaded veal), was topped with an<br />\negg, sunny side up, anchovies,<br />\nand a lemon wedge on the side.<br />\nAlthough this was very good,<br />\nthe spaetzel and potato salad<br />\nwere disappointing. The potato<br />\nsalad had an odd,smokey sweet<br />\nflavor, while the spaetzel,<br />\nwhich should have been fried<br />\ninstead of boiled, was too<br />\ndoughy.<br />\nThe combination Sausage<br />\nconsisted of four large sausages<br />\nwith horse radish and Grey<br />\nPoupon mustard. One tasted a<br />\nlittle too much like an ordinary<br />\nhot dog. Two were a bit spicier<br />\nbut still mild. The last was a<br />\nturkey sausage and was very<br />\npleasing. The broccoli and<br />\npotatoes were good but not<br />\nspecial. We all found the dinner to be filling.<br />\nFor dessert, we sampled the<br />\nStrawberry Pie and Chocolate<br />\nVictory Torte (both $2.75).<br />\nThe pie, containing nearly<br />\n<br />\nwhole berries, and topped with<br />\nwhipped cream and almonds,<br />\nwas amazing. The torte was<br />\nlayers of cake and cream, and<br />\nalso delicious, but by comparison, the strawberry pie was<br />\noutstanding. Both portions<br />\nwere huge.<br />\nWe also tried the Peachtree<br />\nSchnapps, which was very<br />\nflavorful and had a wonderful<br />\naroma; and the Applebarrel,<br />\nwhich was also rich in flavor<br />\nand quite nice.<br />\nAll in all, Haussner's proved<br />\nto be a pleasant dining experience. The prices are<br />\nreasonable and the portions<br />\ngenerous. The waitress was<br />\nfriendly and gave us good service. The restaurant is closed on<br />\nSundays and Mondays and<br />\nreservations for dinner are not<br />\naccepted.

ANDREA PARROT<br />\nTuesday, May 6<br />\n8:00 PM<br />\nL/V Room, Levering Hall<br />\nJHU<br />\n<br />\n\fThe Year in Review: The Ten B<br />\nIt has been, in many ways, an unusual academic year<br />\nfor Hopkins. At a school known for having a politically apathetic student body, protests and sit-ins became<br />\nalmost commonplace. At a school with a relatively<br />\nsmall campus, the administration announced it would<br />\nspend more than $200 million to expand in the next<br />\nfew years alone. At perhaps the nation's leading premed factory, the MCAT (the standard medical school<br />\nadmissions test) became optional.<br />\nIn other ways, though, it has been an utterly typical<br />\nyear. Tuition was increased almost $1000, the Student<br />\nCouncil feuded with the Student Activities Commission and WJHU suffered more delays on the road to<br />\nits much-discussed power boost.<br />\nAs a way of looking back at 1985-86, the Editor and<br />\nNews Editors of the News-Letter chose the year's 10<br />\nbiggest news events. All of them effected students,<br />\nfaculty members and administrators; some of them<br />\nchanged (or will change) the nature of Hopkins.<br />\nFirst on the list is the continuing controversy<br />\nthroughout the year about the University's investments<br />\nin corporations which do business in South Africa.<br />\nQuite Simply, no other story even came close to capturing as much attention as this one. Second are the<br />\nplague of bomb threats which struck the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Library this spring. Affecting almost every<br />\nstudent, the threats were a major disruption to campus life. Third is the continuing development (and<br />\ndelays) of WJHU, the University's radio station. The<br />\ncontroversy over Hopkins' attempted takeover of<br />\nWyman Park last fall is fourth. Although a compromise was eventually struck allowing the University to use part of the park, Hopkins was at odds with<br />\ncommunity leaders for some time. Fifth on the list is<br />\nthe $209 million bond issue Hopkins financed last fall,<br />\nwhile sixth is the report released in September on the<br />\nstatus of women at Hopkins. The inaugural Fall Break<br />\n(both its implementation and its subsequent disappointment) is seventh; eighth is the visit of South<br />\nAfrican Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu in January.<br />\nRounding out the list are the $800 tuition increase announced recently and the irregularities in the meal plan<br />\ncontract exposed last fall.<br />\nIn more detail, here is the complete list:<br />\n<br />\nSouth Africa<br />\nUndoubtedly, no issue has received as<br />\nmuch attention this<br />\nyear as the University's<br />\ninvestments in companies operating in South<br />\nAfrica. Almost from<br />\nthe first day of classes,<br />\nthe matter has been<br />\nheavily discussed by<br />\nstudents, faculty members and administrators. Along the way, an almost unprecedented level<br />\nof student activity developed: protests were staged at<br />\na Board of Trustees meeting, a boycott of classes was<br />\norganized and shanties and gulags were erected on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nIn the past, there have admittedly been some students<br />\ninvolved in political protests. Last year, for example,<br />\na few students demonstrated weekly in front of the<br />\nSouth African embassy in Washington. And there have<br />\ntraditionally been<br />\nprotests over the<br />\nUniversity's nuclear<br />\nweapons research.<br />\nBut in general, the<br />\nUniversity has never<br />\nbeen known as a<br />\nschool with a politically active student<br />\nbody. It is not, obviously, an Eastern<br />\nBerkeley. This year,<br />\nhowever, almost everyone seemed to get animated\u2014<br />\npositively or negatively\u2014about South African<br />\ndivestment.<br />\nThe issue came to the fore as early as late September,<br />\nwhen the Student Council voted to endorse a class<br />\nboycott organized by the Black Student Union. The<br />\nevent, held on October II, was part of a national protest called \"Free Prisoners of Apartheid Day.\" It<br />\ndidn't specifically focus on investments in South<br />\nAfrica, but there was still some discussion of the<br />\n<br />\nThe 10<br />\nBiggest<br />\nNews<br />\nEvents<br />\nof . . .<br />\nmatter.<br />\nA month later, South Africa was back in the news<br />\nas Hopkins graduate student Patrick Bond (later a major figure in the pro-divestment movement) orchestrated a campaign to convince Hopkins to assist<br />\nPatrick Naidoo, a South African medical student and<br />\npolitical refugee. Once again, the specific issue was not<br />\nthe University's investments, although the matter continued to be on everyone's mind.<br />\nIn January, as Hopkins prepared to welcome South<br />\nAfrican Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu, faculty<br />\nmembers, staff members and student groups\u2014most<br />\nprominently the Graduate Representative Organization<br />\nand the Black Student Union\u2014organized the Hopkins<br />\nCoalition for a Free South Africa. The group was<br />\nformed to push the University to divest itself of all<br />\nstocks of corporations which do business in South<br />\nAfrica. It argues that such American companies help<br />\nsupport apartheid (the system of racial separation in<br />\nSouth Africa), and that therefore it is immoral for the<br />\nUniversity to hold such stocks. The Coalition's first<br />\naction was to protest at the Tutu speech.<br />\nAs the spring wore on the Coalition grew, eventually<br />\norganizing a protest at a Board of Trustees meeting<br />\non Feb. 21, a sit-in in Garland Hall on April 4 and<br />\nthe building of a shanty on the lower quad. The shanty was built, according to Paul Genest, co-coordinator<br />\nof the Coalition, to \"symbolize the living conditions<br />\nof blacks in South Africa.\"<br />\nBut as the Coalition grew, so did opposition to it.<br />\nThe group's first setback came in February, when it<br />\nurged the Student Council to sign its \"Points of Unity,\" which advocated divestment. The council voted<br />\n10-9 against signing. (Although the vote was widely<br />\ninterpreted at the time as being a vote on divestment,<br />\nsome council members said later they objected to the<br />\npoints themselves, not divestment per se, and on April<br />\n9 the council voted 19-1 in favor of divestment.) The<br />\ncouncil also decided to hold a referendum of the student body. In a fairly large turn-out, 56 percent of<br />\nthose voting favored divestment.<br />\nAbout the same time, anti-divestment forces in the<br />\nstudent body began to emerge, as a new group\u2014<br />\nStudents for lnkatha\u2014appeared, and the College<br />\nRepublicans publicly argued against divestment. Both<br />\ngroups claimed divestment would actually hurt the<br />\nblacks of South Africa most. Anti-divestment pamphlets went up around campus, and when the Coalition built its shanty the Republicans answered by constructing a gulag, which they said symbolized what<br />\nwould happen to South Africa if the African National<br />\nCongress (which the Coalition supports) takes control<br />\nof South Africa. Last Sunday, the two sides met for<br />\nthe first time in a public debate.<br />\nThe administration's response to all this has been<br />\nmixed. Days before Tutu spoke, the University announced that the Board of Trustees had decided to sell<br />\nall stocks of corporations which operate in South<br />\nAfrica but are not signatories of the Sullivan Principles, a voluntary code of business practices. Since<br />\nthen, the Trustees have reportedly asked their Investbut<br />\nment Subcommittee to examine the issue further.,<br />\nPresident<br />\nUniversity<br />\naction.<br />\nhave taken no other<br />\nSteven Muller hassaid the Board is \"not of one mind.\"<br />\non the issue.<br />\n<br />\n6.<br />\n<br />\nR<br />\n<br />\n7. ma<br />\n8 Tut Spka<br />\n9.<br />\n<br />\nn Inc<br />\n<br />\n10. Meal Plan (<br />\nBomb Scare<br />\nA rash of bomb<br />\nthreats to the M.S.E.<br />\nLibrary interrupted<br />\nand threatened to paralyse the research efforts of many of the<br />\nUniversity's students<br />\nand faculty for a three<br />\nweek period earlier this<br />\nsemester.<br />\nIn all, nine different<br />\nthreats from an as yet<br />\nunapprehended caller or callers resulted in a series of<br />\nlibrary evacuations from February 16 to March 9, according to Manager of Campus Security Robert<br />\nLarkin.<br />\nLarkin recently told the News-Letter that the investigation is no longer \"ongoing,\" but that the case<br />\nis still open.<br />\nThe rash of threats began on Sunday, February 16<br />\nwhen a caller whose voice was described as that of a<br />\nmale in his twenties allegedly told an employee at the<br />\nlibrary that he hated that establishment and that he<br />\nhad planted a bomb on A-level, according to Larkin.<br />\nThe building was<br />\nimmediately evacuated and searched<br />\nby both Homewood<br />\nSecurity and the<br />\nBaltimore City Police, but nothing<br />\nwas found, and the<br />\nlibrary later reopened that night<br />\nwithout incident,<br />\naccording to security.<br />\nThe following<br />\nevening, the same scenario ensued. This time, the<br />\nlibrary received two threats and remained closed for<br />\nthe rest of the evening, although no bomb was ever<br />\nfound on the premises.<br />\nLarkin said at the time that at least one of the calls<br />\nwas made to a phone that is listed only in the University directory and that the calls apparently came from<br />\nsomewhere on the campus.<br />\nOn February 22, the library received yet another<br />\nthreat forcing the evacuation of M.S.E. once again.<br />\nZan Baughan, building manager of the library, said<br />\nat the time that three of the four recently received calls<br />\nwere made to the same telephone. Larkin eleborated<br />\nearlier security suspicions saying that Campus Security believed then that the calls were problably made<br />\nfrom on-campus, possibly even from inside the library<br />\nitself.<br />\nAccording to Larkin, the library employee who<br />\nanswered the phone described the caller as alledgedly<br />\nhaving a \"strange scratchy male voice.\"<br />\nAt the time of the February 22 threat, Library<br />\nBuilding Superintendant Henry Heath said that library<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/n<br />\n<br />\nBiggest News Stories of 1985-86<br />\ntments<br />\nibrary<br />\nf5s5wer<br />\nOr Wyman Park<br />\nsions<br />\nEx<br />\nen<br />\nak<br />\n<br />\nik<br />\nInc<br />\n<br />\ned $<br />\n<br />\nI Plan Contract<br />\nsecurity was remaining at a somewhat higher level than<br />\nusual. Package searches and extra guards were added<br />\nto improve the building's security.<br />\nOn March 2 three more threats were received, and<br />\non March 4, an additional threat was called in. 5'xurity<br />\nCoordinator Edward Weichert said at the time that the<br />\ndetails of all four were very similar. Each time a call<br />\nwas received, the caller alledgedly said, \"There's a<br />\nbomb in your library,\" according to Weichert.<br />\nThe library was evacuated and searched each time<br />\na threat was made, according to the security reports<br />\nof the incidents.<br />\nFinally, on March 9, the last of the recent wave of<br />\nbomb threats was received. This time, the library<br />\nemployee who took the call described the caller as<br />\nalledgedly having a female voice, according to Security<br />\nTraining Officer Orin Hughes.<br />\nHughes added that the wording of the threat was<br />\nreportedly similar to that of all the previous calls. In<br />\naddition, he said, \"In all the cases, attempts were made<br />\nto disguise the natural speaking voice of the caller.<br />\nRecently, Larkin said that he was happy to report<br />\nthat \"it appears that they [the threats] have stopped.\"<br />\n<br />\nWJHU<br />\nIf there were an<br />\naward for the most<br />\ndichotomous story of<br />\nthe year, the trials and<br />\ntribulations of WJHU<br />\nwould surely win it.<br />\nThroughout the<br />\nyear, plans have been<br />\nmade, staff members<br />\nhave been hired and<br />\nstudios have been constructed. But with every new accomplishment there seemed to come a new<br />\nsetback: another delay of the date for the station's<br />\nmuch discussed power increase.<br />\nEarly last fall, the station was scheduled to go on<br />\nthe air by March 17, when its extension from the<br />\nFederal Communications Commission expired. In<br />\nJanuary, however, General Manager David Creagh announced that deadline would not be<br />\nmet, and predicted<br />\na new start-up date<br />\nof early June.<br />\nSuch delays were<br />\nhardly new to<br />\nWJHU. Since the<br />\nFCC ruled several<br />\nyears ago that no<br />\nstations under 100<br />\nwatts would be allowed to operate,<br />\nthe station\u2014currently a 10 watt, student-run operation\u2014has been<br />\nplanning for a power boost, only to be plagued by<br />\nmany delays. Last summer, the University finally made<br />\na definitive decision to go ahead with the power in-<br />\n<br />\ncrease. Although many students had hoped the larger<br />\nstation would also be student-run, the administration<br />\nquickly announced it would hire professional staff<br />\nmembers for the station. David Creagh, previously the<br />\ngeneral manager of KLON-FM in Long Beach,<br />\nCalifornia, was then hired as the station's general<br />\nmanager.<br />\nCreagh immediately announced that only three positions would be set aside specifically for students, angering many workers at the 10-watt station who felt more<br />\nopportunities for students should be available. \"I will<br />\nnot operate on double standards,\" Creagh said. \"Positions are available to students on a competitive basis.\"<br />\nIn the fall, work really got underway on the larger<br />\nsiation, as a managerial team was slowly assembled,<br />\nan office building was leased and construction was<br />\nbegun on studios and a transmitter location was<br />\nchosen. In January, however, the station seemed to<br />\nsuffer two reversals: the delay until June was announced, and Creagh revealed the station would not broadcast at 25,000 watts (the figure traditionally discussed), but at 10,000. This was because the antenna will<br />\nbe higher than had been previously thought, allowing<br />\nthe lower wattage to reach the same size audience.<br />\nAbout the same time, a few students currently involved with the 10-watt station proposed the idea of<br />\na second Hopkins radio station. Once the<br />\nprofessionally-managed WJHU goes on the air, they<br />\nargued, a smaller, student-run station could be allowed to operate. Two principle alternatives were proposed: a normal broadcast station, or a \"carrier station,\"<br />\nwhich operates much like a closed-circuit TV station.<br />\nIn late January, University President Steven Muller<br />\nasked Dean of Administration Robert Welch to examine the idea of a second station; Welch has not yet<br />\nreported.<br />\nA few weeks later, the Student Council decided to<br />\ntake its own look at the problem, and formed an Ad<br />\nHoc Radio Committee. This week, it is distributing<br />\na survey among students to determine if there is significant interest in a second station.<br />\n<br />\nWyman Park<br />\nWhile Hopkins has<br />\nnever been known for<br />\nhaving a completely<br />\naffectionate relationship vis-a-vis the surrounding community,<br />\nthe situation became<br />\nfar worse last summer<br />\nand fall, as the University tried to expand<br />\ninto nearby Wyman<br />\nPark. Fierce opposition arose in the community, but in October a compromise was struck that seemed to please both sides.<br />\nThe whole affair began during the summer of 1985,<br />\nwhen University officials submitted a plan to the<br />\nBaltimore Parks Board to retake 40 acres of the park,<br />\nwhich is adjacent to the campus. The land had<br />\noriginally been owned by the University, but had been<br />\ngiven to the city between 1902 and 1926.<br />\nHopkins hoped<br />\nto construct several<br />\nbuildings on the<br />\nsite, including one<br />\nfor an outside research organization<br />\nwhich would engage<br />\nin joint ventures<br />\nwith the University.<br />\nOpposition to the<br />\nplan arose quickly,<br />\nculminating in Wyman Park Appreciation Day on<br />\nSept. 29. Community members argued the expansion<br />\nwould displace the park's wildlife, increase traffic in<br />\nthe area and change the water level, possibly causing<br />\nfuture flooding.<br />\n\"I just don't want to see it developed,\" stated City<br />\nCouncilman Anthony Ambridge, who represents the<br />\narea. \"It's just a beautiful, beautiful park.\"<br />\nIn response to all this, Mayor William Donald<br />\nSchaefer\u2014who had apparently originally encouraged<br />\nthe University to expand into the park\u2014appointed a<br />\ntask force to study the problem. The panel, composed of community leaders and University representatives, reported to the Mayor in late October.<br />\nIt recommended that a section of the park be leas-<br />\n<br />\ned to Hopkins to be used as an intramural athletic<br />\nfield, thereby allowing the University to build on its<br />\ncurrent intramural field, which abuts the park. Task<br />\nForce Chairman David Cordish, a Baltimore lawyer,<br />\nsaid this would preserve the park, since an athletic field<br />\nwould be far less disruptive than new buildings. The<br />\nplan won instant approval from both camps and the<br />\nMayor.<br />\n<br />\nBond Issue<br />\nIn what has been<br />\ncalled the largest program of its kind in the<br />\nhistor..y of Hopkins<br />\nand of the state, the<br />\nUniversity succeeded<br />\nlast semester in obtaining the necessary financing for a massive<br />\n$209 million construction and rennovation<br />\nproject for Homewood<br />\nand the University at large.<br />\nThe program which will soon change the face of the<br />\nUniversity will include, among other projects, the construction of three new research buildings for physics<br />\nand astronomy, geo-physics, and neuroscience; rennovations of Gilman, Remsen, and Ames; additions<br />\nI to Shaffer and the School of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth; unspecified improvements in student housing;<br />\nand the acquisition of a new building in Washington<br />\nfor the School of Advanced International Studies.<br />\nThe decision last semester to go ahead with one<br />\nmassive burst of construction was made primarily to<br />\nbeat expected federal legislation in<br />\nearly 1986 that<br />\nwould have eliminated the tax exempt status for such<br />\nproject financing.<br />\nAs University<br />\nPresident Steven<br />\nMuller said last fall,<br />\n\"A major tax law<br />\nrevision at this time<br />\nwould represent a<br />\nmajor risk in our<br />\nability to [complete our long term building and renovation goals].\"<br />\nMuller also remarked that the decision was partially based on a desire to continue attracting \"red hot<br />\nacademic research\" in the form of projects similar to<br />\nthe Space Telescope Science Institute, like the newly<br />\nplanned neuroscience and geo-physics buildings.<br />\nMost of the projects are slaked for ground breaking<br />\nfrom mid-1986 to 1987 with completion dates for all<br />\neighteen major projects scheduled before the end of<br />\nthe decade, according to Thomas McCracken, director of plant planning.<br />\nThe multi-million dollar package was financed by<br />\n$181 million in revenue bonds from the Maryland<br />\nHealth and Higher Education Facilities Authority. The<br />\nremaining $28 million for the project will come from<br />\nthe interest on the $181 principle.<br />\n<br />\nThe Status<br />\nOf Women<br />\nFeminists have long<br />\nclaimed Hopkins provides few opportunities<br />\nfor women.

Muller's recommendation was itself based on the recommendation of V. David VandeLinde,<br />\ndean of the G.W.C. Whiting School of Engineering,<br />\nand George Fisher, dean of the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nDuring a meeting with Student Council some months<br />\nlater, Muller defended the tuition hike saying, \"The<br />\ncosts in which we expect undergraduates to share are<br />\ngoing up.\" He added, \"After inflation, this represents<br />\na real increase of less than five percent.\"<br />\nMuller also cited increasing faculty salaries and improvements of \"academic as well as non-academic<br />\nfacilities\" as contributing to the higher costs. He added, \"It's impossible to have high quality instruction<br />\nwithout redoing aome of these facilities. The funds<br />\ncan't all come from gifts.\"<br />\nStudent Council President-Elect Mark Komisky<br />\ndefended Muller's position saying, \"I think the increase is quite appropriate,\" but added that he would<br />\nhave liked to have seen more funds spend on nonacademic facilities.<br />\nAt the meeting, Muller also presented a list of<br />\nschools ranked by 1985-86 tuition and showed that<br />\nHopkins was ranked as the 50th most expensive school<br />\namong them. \"My guess is we will stay in this position this year and for the indefinite future,\" commented Muller.<br />\nWhile Muller said that students receiving financial<br />\naid should not be affected by the increased tuition<br />\ncosts, he did express some concern over proposed<br />\nfederal budget cuts in education. \"The President's proposal for the federal budget once again calls for a<br />\nmassive reduction in some of the student aid programs. . . with the majority of these cuts affecting middle income Americans,\" he said.<br />\nHowever, Muller warned that the University budget<br />\ndoes not allow for extra expenditures in student aid<br />\nshould Congress approve these cuts in the case that<br />\nGramm-Rudman becomes effective.<br />\n<br />\nMeal Plan<br />\nStudents subscribing<br />\nto the ARA meal service have chronically<br />\ncomplained about the<br />\nquality of the food,<br />\nbut last November<br />\nmany started complaining about the<br />\nprice.<br />\nIn an investigative<br />\nreport first semester,<br />\nthe News-Letter reported the prices of the various meal plans, comparing them to the cost of buying meals on a daily basis.<br />\nIt was found that if students were on the 14 meal per<br />\nweek plan and did not attend intersession, they would<br />\nneed to eat 106.8 percent of their meals in order to<br />\nsave money, an obvious impossibility. The NewsLetter also showed that if the fourteen meal subscriber<br />\ndid attend intercession, he would have to eat 98.4 percent of his meals.<br />\nBettye Miller, director of Auxiliary Enterprises said<br />\nat the time that the costs of \"casual\" meals and the<br />\nmeal plans could not be compared. Miller added that<br />\n\"We do not base its [the meal plan's] cost on the casual<br />\nmeal rate. There is no rationale to it.\"<br />\nMiller also said that the meal plan costs could not<br />\nbe lowered, saying, \"to lower the cost of the meal plan<br />\nwould be to lower the quality of the food. They would<br />\nserve sawdust if they had to.\"<br />\nAlthough admitting that few people eat in the Terrace Room on a casual basis, Miller added that raising the prices of the casual meals would discourage<br />\nthe few who did attend on a daily basis.<br />\nFurther investigation of the meal plan prices revealed an even greater disparity in the differences of price<br />\nbetween the meal plans and the casual rates.

Never in his AllAmerica days at St. Mary's<br />\nhigh school nor at Hopkins has<br />\nBubier put so many into the<br />\nnet.<br />\nHe was, to state it simply,<br />\nunstoppable. He scored off fast<br />\nbreaks, he scored from outside,<br />\nbut mostly he bullied his way<br />\naround inside and drilled shots<br />\ndown goalie Joe Donnelly's<br />\nthroat. The scary thing is that<br />\neveryone agreed that Bubier<br />\ncan play even better. \"There's<br />\nmore to the game than scoring<br />\ngoals,\" he said. It's a helluva<br />\nstart though.<br />\nOne thing's for sure; he<br />\ndidn't do it without a lot of<br />\nhelp. Seven of Bubier's goals<br />\nwere assisted, which speaks<br />\nvolumes about the Blue Jay<br />\nway. When a Hopkins player<br />\nexplodes like Bubier did, it is<br />\nmore by chance than by design.<br />\n\"He did a great job getting in<br />\nthe right place at the right<br />\ntime,\" said Brian Wood,\"but<br />\nI've seen him have better<br />\ngames.\" Wood should know;<br />\nthe two have been teammates<br />\nfor seven years.<br />\nHopkins needed all they<br />\ncould muster on this day. Navy<br />\njumped out to a 4-1 lead in the<br />\n2nd quarter, lost the advantage,<br />\nbut then stayed within striking<br />\ndistance till the end. The Jays<br />\nnever led by more than three.<br />\nLost in all the hoopla was the<br />\ngreat day that Wood turned in.<br />\nHe shook off yet another<br />\ndefense that just let him breathe<br />\n<br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br />\n<br />\nJohn DeTommaso fights off Navy's Paul Basile near the Blue Jay cage as goalie Stu Jones<br />\nlooks on.<br />\n<br />\nand little else to score 3 .goals<br />\nand 3 assists. Del Dressel was<br />\nalso sharp, although the stats<br />\nwon't show it(1 goal, 3 assists).<br />\nOnce again, Dressel seemed to<br />\nbe on top of every groundball<br />\n(he picked up 11) and generally just dominated the midfield.<br />\nAll he didn't do was score big,<br />\nand that was only because Donnelly seemed to make a great<br />\nsave every time he shot.<br />\n<br />\nMidfielder Brendan Kelly<br />\npaid the price for his big day<br />\nagainst Maryland two weeks<br />\nago. Navy coach Brian Matthews must have looked at films<br />\nof the 5'9\" 150 pounder and<br />\ndecided that the best strategy<br />\nwas to have his defenders<br />\nknock him around whenever he<br />\ngot the ball. Kelly still tallied a<br />\ngoal and 2 assists, but certainly paid the price.<br />\n<br />\nBruce Chanenchuk and Steve<br />\nMitchell, a couple of players<br />\nwho don't get much ink, both<br />\nturned in particularly good<br />\ngames, although you won't see<br />\nit one the stat sheet. On paper,<br />\nChanenchuk only had one<br />\nassist, but this won't tell you<br />\nhow his speed in the offensive<br />\nend created several opportunities. Mitchell got beaten<br />\nbadly by Navy's Glenn Miles<br />\nearly, but then buckled down<br />\nand showed how awesome someone with his physical tools<br />\ncan be. When Brad McLam, his<br />\nlong stick partner on the rope,<br />\nwent down with a serious knee<br />\ninjury, Mitchell seemed to raise<br />\nhis level of play a notch. He did<br />\nthe thin.s that McLam usuall<br />\n<br />\nexcels at, like picking up thegroundball off of faceoffs and<br />\nigniting the fast break.<br />\nDefensively, the Jays have<br />\nplayed better. They had trouble<br />\ncontrolling Miles, who had 4<br />\ngoals, but then again everybody<br />\nhas this year. John DeTommaso had one spectacular play,<br />\nmaking a chest save on what<br />\nlooked like an easy Navy goal<br />\nwith Stu Jones out of the crease,<br />\nand otherwise dominated as<br />\nusual. His linemates, Dan<br />\nPallace and Jon Krome didn't<br />\nget burned, but didn't cause<br />\nmany loose balls either.<br />\nThe unknown factor in<br />\nHopkins' run for a 3rd straight<br />\ntitle may well be freshman<br />\ndefenseman Dave Pietramala.<br />\nA highly touted recruit.<br />\nPietramala missed half the<br />\nseason and then didn't see extensive action until Saturday. With<br />\nMcLam on the shelf, Pietramala<br />\nwill play a key role down the<br />\nstretch. Against Navy, he<br />\nplayed a lot on the rope and<br />\nlooked impressive.<br />\nAt the outset, the game looked like a duel of the keepers,<br />\nwith Navy's Donnelly and<br />\nHopkins' Jones making save<br />\nafter save. Bubier had a good<br />\nshot 45 seconds into the game,<br />\nbut hit the post, about the only<br />\ntime he'd miss all day. Navy<br />\nmanaged to score the only goal<br />\nof the period; Bob Wehman on<br />\nan assist from Frank Snyder at<br />\n5:02.<br />\nJones made a big save early<br />\nin the second quarter, but it<br />\nturned into a costly sequence as<br />\nthe Jays cleared but McLam<br />\nwent down. The diagnosis was<br />\nknee ligament damage, and he<br />\nhad arthroscopic surgery on<br />\nSunday.,.<br />\nA minute later, Bubier put<br />\nHopkins on the board. Mike<br />\nMorrill ran towards the net<br />\nalone on the left, and when he<br />\nwas picked up found Bubier<br />\nparked in front of the crease for<br />\nan easy score.

He also added that Hopkins was \"one of<br />\nthe last [major universities] to<br />\ndo a film.\"<br />\nAdvance planning, which<br />\nbegan in the fall, secured Mark<br />\nHollander, a recent graduate of<br />\nHopkins, and his Baltimorebased film company, On Line<br />\nProductions.<br />\nSelection of the principals<br />\nwas conducted by the filming<br />\ncompany.

The Barnstormers have been blessed this<br />\ntime around with a very serious<br />\ntheatre student, Carol Gerry,<br />\nwho is taking the directing<br />\nmils. Gerry, a recent transfer,<br />\neventually wants to build a<br />\ncareer out of directing the Bard<br />\nso I guess that makes her role<br />\nhere rather appropriaste (you<br />\nmay want to ask her herself<br />\nwhat she's doing at Hopkins of<br />\nall places, that's another story).<br />\nIn other words, this looks to be<br />\na serious effort.<br />\nFor those of you who aren't<br />\nEnglish majors: the play<br />\nrevolves around, while never<br />\nreally focusing on, the marriage<br /><br />\nMidsummer-night's Dream this weekend at 8 p.m. in the L/V Room. $2 advance, $3 at the door.<br /><br />\nof the heroic Duke of Athens,<br />\nTheseus, (played by erstwhile<br />\nArts writer Jason Hanson)and<br />\nHippolyta, queen of the<br />\nAmazons. The bulk of the play,<br />\nhowever, deals with a whole<br />\nbunch of sets of lovers and<br />\nsome fairy mischief. Hermia<br />\n(Joanne Howell) is being forced to marry Demetrius (Louis<br />\nKlieman) but she really loves<br />\nLysander (Scott McNamee),<br /><br />\nand Helena (Kathy Kennedy)<br />\nreally loves Demetrius, though<br />\nhe could care less. Somehow<br />\nthey all find their way into the<br />\nfairy woods (the fairies have<br />\napparently come from India for<br />\nthe big wedding) and some<br />\ngreat complications ensue, a<br />\nproduct of the little hobgoblin,<br />\nPuck (Kelli Midgley), and some<br />\nmagic love juice. You see, Puck<br />\nis the servant of the fairy-king,<br /><br />\nOberon (Rich Bigelow), who is<br />\nhaving a spat with his wife<br />\nTitania (Chrissie Stanfel). He<br />\nwants the love juice in order to<br />\nembarass her by making her fall<br />\nin love with some monstrosity\u2014<br />\nwhich turns out to be an assheaded (literally) local weaver<br />\nnamed Bottom (Greg Harmon).<br />\nEtcetera. . .<br />\nGerry hints that the scenes<br />\nwith the fairies should be<br /><br />\nespecially flashy, even though<br />\nthe play itself will be staged<br />\nsomewhat minimally due to the<br />\nconstraints of the L/V stage<br />\n(and an SAC budget, I assume).<br />\nNevertheless, the forest scenes<br />\nwill be fascinating due to a<br />\ndeceptively simple yet effective<br />\nstage design. You'll see what I<br />\nmean. Furthermore, although<br />\nGerry is quick to point out that<br />\nA Midsummer-night's Dream is<br />\nessentially a fun, light play, she<br />\nfeels that this production will<br />\nbring out some of the darker<br />\nelements in the play as well.<br />\nIf this production is a success, and the signs point toward<br />\nthat, perhaps the future of the<br />\nBarnstormers lies in a more<br />\nserious direction. Let's face it,<br />\neven though Godspell ultimately was a pretty good show, any<br />\ngroup of pre-teens anywhere<br />\ncould put on a convincing performance of that musical. One<br />\nof the encouraging signs is the<br />\nlarge crop of freshmen in the<br />\ncast of the show\u2014about 60 percent of a cast of 22(!). In<br />\nanother two or three years the<br />\nBarnstormers could be turning<br />\n'Baltimore on its ear. That's<br />\ncould; let's just hope Orgo and<br />\nMole Cell don't claim their<br />\nusual victims.<br /><br />\nPrince's Bellybutton Hotter Than Ever!<br />\nby Sue Trowbridge<br />\nI was going to review the new<br />\nPrince album this week, but<br />\nsince half the publications in<br />\nAmerica have already done so,<br />\nlet's turn our attention to some<br />\nrecords that are a bit off the<br />\nbeaten track.

Detorie is not tasteless\u2014<br />\nbut nor is he very funny.<br />\nDetorie covers, in pictorial<br />\nform, every topic from<br />\n\"Catholic Guilt\" to \"Favorite<br />\nCatholic Saints.\" Some of his<br />\nillustrations are quite funny and<br />\ndo conjure up memories of<br />\nelementary and high school<br />\ndays. Many deal with topics<br />\nthat are no longer existant in<br />\nCatholic schools. Because<br />\nCatholicism has long been<br /><br />\nridiculed for its pecularities, it<br />\nis puzzling why Detorie would<br />\nwant to accentuate so many of<br />\nthese quirks which have, for the<br />\nmost part, been put to rest.<br />\nSome of these illustrations<br />\nsimply don't work. While a<br />\ntopic may have once been<br />\npuzzling for the average school<br />\nchild (and therefore humorous<br />\nto the average Catholic adult),<br />\nDetorie does not do a fantastic<br />\njob of translating that topic into a humorous situation.<br />\nDetorie is a talented illustrator.

The English<br />\ncreatures roaming the social<br />\nlandscape are familiar, easy to<br />\ndislike, but engaging nonetheless.<br />\nA Room with a View occasionally becomes muddled<br />\nmechanically, with messy<br />\nscenes. Dialogue tags are<br />\nsometimes absent when they<br />\nwould make for a cleaner narrative and Forster's prose is not<br />\nas sophisticated as more<br />\nmodern work. He writes with a<br />\nlurching feel; the cleverly,<br />\nperfectly artificial world he<br />\nobserves is cast in language<br />\nwhich is askew. Incidental<br />\ncharacters are not quite so incidental, but the explanation<br />\nfor their presence isn't usually<br />\nsatisfactory: they wander<br />\naround, pop by for tea and<br />\nmeander off again.

When he does<br />\nthings which are inexplicable by<br />\nLucy's standards he is hardly<br />\nmore intelligible to the reader.<br />\nActions depend on coincidence<br />\nand contrived impulses.<br />\nAll in all, Forster's novel is<br />\na decent read, requiring only<br />\nsome generosity toward the<br />\ncharacters and a pardon for the<br />\noccasional akward scene.<br /><br />\n\"Love is What You Have Left to Betray\"<br />\nA Perfect Spy<br />\nby John LeCarre<br />\nAlfred A. Knopf, $18.95. 475<br />\npages.<br />\nby Cliff Robinson<br />\nIn A Perfect Spy, John<br />\nLeCarre has brought his<br />\nreaders a complicated, very<br />\nemotional story of betrayal and<br />\nsearches on several levels.<br />\nMoreover, A Perfect Spy tells<br />\nof Magnus Pym, senior British<br />\nIntelligence operative, who<br />\ndisappears after the death of his<br />\nfather. Taking a lifetime of<br />\nsecrets with him, Pym embarks<br />\non a journey through his own<br />\nlife's story, trying to find his<br />\ntrue \"self\"\u2014a part of him that<br />\nis genuine, and not just a cover<br />\nfor one of his numerous<br />\nbetrayals.<br />\nLeCarre's main characters<br />\nalways seem to be tormented,<br />\nand are usually involved in<br />\nsome kind of search for their<br />\nown identity. Like the heroine<br />\nin The Little Drummer Girl, or<br />\nGeorge Smiley in Smiley's People, the lives of LeCarre's<br />\ncharacters are somehow in-<br /><br />\ncomplete, and they look for<br />\nsomething to fill the gap.<br />\nUsually, however, that search is<br />\nsecondary to the main action of<br />\nthe novel. In A Perfect Spy,<br />\nMagnus Pym's search for<br />\nhimself is the primary focus of<br />\nthe plot. The main aspect of the<br />\nbook, the development of<br />\nMagnus Pym's character, is<br />\nespecially well done. Pym is<br />\nrevealed as a man with no close<br />\npersonal involvements, no<br />\ndiscernable loyalty to anyone.<br />\nHe also has no true character,<br />\nno driving focus or goals\u2014he<br />\ndoes not know who he is, and<br />\nneither does anyone else. While<br />\nthis may make him a \"perfect<br />\nspy,\" it also makes him a deeply troubled man, one in search<br />\nof a mission, a cause, or an<br />\nidentity.<br />\nWhen we are first introduced<br />\nto Magnus, we see a man who<br />\nis warm, effusive, well-liked by<br />\neveryone he knows and loved<br />\nby many. He is able to be many<br />\nthings to many people, and virtually everyone has a slightly<br />\ndifferent impression of him.<br />\nYet while many love Magnus,<br />\nno one is truly close to him. His<br />\nwife and he seem to have a<br /><br />\nbeautiful relationship, which<br />\neveryone admires, but she<br />\ndoesn't share his secrets. Nor<br />\ndo his agents or colleagues in<br />\nBritish Intelligence really<br />\nunderstand him.<br />\nThis ability to change<br />\n\"masks\" so readily makes him<br />\nan ideal spy, but behind Pym's<br />\nmasks, there is nothing. We<br />\nsoon realize, as does Magnus,<br />\nthat his entire being is devoted<br />\nto the expression of countless<br />\nsuperficial identities\u2014he cannot find a private self apart<br />\nfrom his facades.<br />\nskillfully<br />\nLeCarre<br />\ndemonstrates this as Magnus<br />\nwrites to his son Tom, telling<br />\nhim about his life. Almost exclusively, Magnus refers to<br />\nhimself as Pym, especially<br />\nwhen he is acting in an assumed<br />\nidentity, even with his family.<br />\nThe only time he says \"I\" is if<br />\nhe speaks of a deeply meaningful, important event, and<br />\nthen only with great emotion.<br />\nThe fact that \"I\" appears so infrequently shows that any part<br />\nof him which feels deeply, or<br />\ntruly cares about anything, is<br />\nvery small and hidden amid the<br />\nmasks of faces which make up<br /><br />\nhis \"covers.\" There is little left<br />\nof the true Magnus Pym. As<br />\nanother agent says to him,<br />\n\"Magnus, you are the perfect<br />\nspy. Now all you need is a<br />\nmission.\"<br />\nIt is the search for this mission that causes Magnus to<br />\ndisappear, and begin a journey<br />\nthrough his past. \"Sometimes<br />\nour actions are questions, not<br />\nanswers,\" he says, and calls his<br />\ndisappearance \"The first conscious decision I ever made in<br />\nmy life.\" As he unravels the<br />\nthreads of his life, his<br />\nchildhood is shown to be a<br />\ntraining ground for a lifetime of<br />\nbetrayals, hidden meanings and<br />\nintrigue. At the same time,<br />\nBritish Intelligence is looking<br />\nfor him, and trying to understand him and his motives.<br />\nGradually, they both begin to<br />\nrealize that for his whole life,<br />\nhis lack of conscious decisions<br />\nis a result of his not having a<br />\ncause to be loyal to, a single<br />\nperson to care about, or any<br />\ndriving force behind his actions. He becomes enmeshed in<br />\na circle of duplicity, with double agents whose loyalty is constantly in question. His rela-<br /><br />\ntionship with his wife parallels<br />\nhis career, and his loyalty to his<br />\ncountry, and again he is unwilling, or unable, to make a strong<br />\ncommitment.<br />\nTo a large extent, Pym's<br />\nsearch goes unresolved. Even at<br />\nthe end of the book, questions<br />\nstill remain about the ultimate<br />\nmotives of both Pym and some<br />\nof the agents he is involved<br />\nwith. We are not sure if he intended to betray those things he<br />\nthought were important for<br />\nsome greater cause. He may<br />\nlove his country, his father, his<br />\nson. Or he may still have no<br />\nloyalty, not even to himself. It<br />\nseems that he himself is unsure,<br />\nas if LeCarre wishes to avoid<br />\nmaking any statement about<br />\nthe final value of commitments.<br />\nInstead, we just see that all<br />\nPym's relationships are based<br />\nupon deceit. Pym says, \"Love<br />\nis what you have left to<br />\nbetray,\" so it may very well be<br />\nthat he loves most what he<br />\nbetrays. It does not matter<br />\nultimately, for when all the interpretations are stripped away,<br />\nA Perfect Spy is still an excellent spy novel, and wellrecommended.<br /><br />\n12/MAY 2, 1986<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nContinued from Page 11<br /><br />\nof South Africa's arms come<br />\nfrom France or Italy, funneled<br />\nSouth African people and arms through by European or Arab<br />\nSouth Africa with both conven- states.

Most<br /><br />\nImproper Collusion<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI was quite bemused to compare much of the Coalition for<br />\na Free South Africa's recent<br />\nrhetoric to their actions at this<br />\npast week's Graduate Represen<br />\ntative Organization meeting as<br />\nreported in the News-Letter on<br />\nApril 18. It seems that the GRO<br />\naccepted a motion from its Vice<br />\nChairman Patrick Bond (also a<br />\nprominent figure in the Coalition) which entailed that the<br />\nGRO would not discuss Coalition business in the presence of<br />\nthe News-Letter's reporter.<br />\nThis follows on the heels of the<br />\nGRO's and the Coalition's<br />\ndenials of allegations levelled<br />\nby Students for Inkatha among<br />\nothers, asserting that the two<br />\norganizations are nearly indistinguishable, and also on the<br />\nheels of the Coalition's own demand for a better level of<br />\nrhetoric in the South Africa<br />\ndebate.<br />\nThe irony is clear: when two<br /><br />\nPUBPIZZA<br />\nFREE DELIVERY<br /><br />\n243-1611<br />\nOne Coupon per Delivery<br /><br />\nPlease Tip Drivers<br /><br />\n$1.00 OFF<br />\n6-PACK of BEER<br /><br />\n00 OFF<br />\n8 $2.<br />\n16\"PIZZA<br /><br />\nparties are suspected of collusion in a manner which possibly<br />\ncompromises the charters and<br />\nideals of each, they are entitled<br />\nto issue a denial, and have it<br />\ntreated with all fairness and<br />\nconsideration. Yet if the two<br />\nparties immediately afterwards<br />\nretire to closed doors, explicitly excluding the only campus<br />\noutlet for news of their actions,<br />\neven the most innocent of souls<br />\nmust begin to harbour a bit of<br />\nsuspicion. If the Coalition and<br />\nthe GRO wish to demonstrate<br />\ntheir autonomy, I can imagine<br />\nno more convincing display<br />\nthan an open GRO meeting in<br />\nwhich that organization's role<br />\nin the Coalition is clearly and<br />\nhonestly discussed, and then<br />\nreported to the general Hopkins<br />\nCommunity in the News-Letter.<br />\nAs matters stand, I cannot help<br />\nbut conclude that the allegations of improper collusion are<br />\nentirely correct.

This not only goes far in<br />\ndarkening and trivializing the<br />\nopen debate on campus about<br />\ndivestment, but is belies many<br />\nfacts that are crucial to all those<br />\ngroups who are seeking change<br /><br />\nin South Africa by invovling<br />\nthemselves in this debate.<br />\nMangosuthu Buthelezi, a<br />\ndevout Anglican, follows a<br />\nprinciple of political action that<br />\nshould be well-known to all<br />\nAmericans. This is the tenet of<br />\nnonviolent action as a means of<br />\ncontrolled change and freedom<br />\nand justice for all peoples. This<br />\nis no claim that Buthelezi<br />\ncreated this philosophy; it is<br />\nwell known that two figures in<br />\nworld history no less than<br />\nMahatma Gandhi and Martin<br />\nLuther King, Jr. were pioneers<br />\nin this system of ideals.<br />\nHowever, do we label the firs a<br />\n\"stooge\" of the British colonial<br />\ngovernment in India or of<br />\nViceroy Mountbatten? Do we<br />\ncall King a \"pawn\" or<br />\n\"stooge\" of John F. Kennedy<br />\nsimply because he was against<br />\nbloodshed? The answer is a<br />\nsimple \"no.\" Both men are<br />\nrevered as great heroes and only labeled as villains by those<br />\nwho do not understand that<br />\nviolence is idiocy.<br />\nThe Coalition often asks how<br />\nlong the peoples of nonviolence<br />\nwish to wait to end apartheid.<br />\n50 years? 100 years? However,<br />\nan equally relevant question is<br />\nhow many lives do the supporters of murder and guerrilla<br />\nwarfare wish to take to end<br />\napartheid? 100,000 dead?<br />\n300,000 dead? These are not<br />\nunrealistic figures if total civil<br />\nwar erupts in South Africa.<br />\nPeople such as the ANC's<br />\nOliver, Bishop Tutu and the<br />\nCoalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica (by virtue of their<br />\ndevoted support of the ANC)<br />\nall seem to advocate violence.<br />\nAs Tambo has said,\"We wish<br />\nto make this country ungovernable.\" Buthelezi and Inkatha<br />\ncan only denounce this violence<br />\nand fight off the rain of epithets<br />\nof hatred thrown toward them.<br />\nIn the words of Buthelezi, \"I<br />\nrealize that there are many peo'pie who hate my guts for daring even to grope for a peaceful<br />\nsolution after the violence that<br />\nhas been unleashed against<br />\nblacks in the past months. I am<br />\nnot ashamed to do whatever is<br />\nwithin the realm of the possible<br />\nto prevent bloodshed.\" It is for<br />\nthis reason that Buthelezi is<br />\nagainst divestment and works<br />\nto preserve peace and stability<br />\nin South Africa, as well as to<br />\nend apartheid.<br />\nWilliam Wallace<br />\nThe writer is a member of<br />\nStudents for Inkatha.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br /><br />\nLooking Back at Council<br />\nContinued from Page 9<br />\nAlong the same lines, the<br />\nHousing Committee ran a pizza party for the members of<br />\nWolman, McCoy, and Rogers<br />\nas well as donut sessions to<br />\nenable the tenants to express<br />\ncomplaints or just hear what<br />\nwas being done in regards to<br />\nrenovations or the new security system.

To be able to take any<br />\nstand on the issue, the council<br />\nneeded to take the time to do<br />\nresearch. We listened to the<br />\nTreasurer of the University,<br />\nmenbers of the Coalition for a<br />\nFree South Africa, sent to the<br />\nstudents a non-binding referendum, as well as talking to people and reading materials. After<br />\nmuch time and debate, the<br />\ncouncil decided to support the<br />\nresolution similar to that of<br />\nPIIAC calling for divestment.<br />\nThe other day someone asked me what I felt was the most<br />\nimportant thing I had done this<br />\nyear.

The food<br />\narrived in generous portions.<br />\nThe Sour Beef was tender but<br />\nsmothered in a large amount of<br />\ngravy which was a little too<br />\nsweet. The dumplings were<br />\nsimilar in flavor and a bit<br />\nbland. The eggplant, however,<br /><br />\nwas tasty.<br />\nThe Wiener Schnitzel(breaded veal), was topped with an<br />\negg, sunny side up, anchovies,<br />\nand a lemon wedge on the side.<br />\nAlthough this was very good,<br />\nthe spaetzel and potato salad<br />\nwere disappointing. The potato<br />\nsalad had an odd,smokey sweet<br />\nflavor, while the spaetzel,<br />\nwhich should have been fried<br />\ninstead of boiled, was too<br />\ndoughy.<br />\nThe combination Sausage<br />\nconsisted of four large sausages<br />\nwith horse radish and Grey<br />\nPoupon mustard. One tasted a<br />\nlittle too much like an ordinary<br />\nhot dog. Two were a bit spicier<br />\nbut still mild. The last was a<br />\nturkey sausage and was very<br />\npleasing. The broccoli and<br />\npotatoes were good but not<br />\nspecial. We all found the dinner to be filling.<br />\nFor dessert, we sampled the<br />\nStrawberry Pie and Chocolate<br />\nVictory Torte (both $2.75).<br />\nThe pie, containing nearly<br /><br />\nwhole berries, and topped with<br />\nwhipped cream and almonds,<br />\nwas amazing. The torte was<br />\nlayers of cake and cream, and<br />\nalso delicious, but by comparison, the strawberry pie was<br />\noutstanding. Both portions<br />\nwere huge.<br />\nWe also tried the Peachtree<br />\nSchnapps, which was very<br />\nflavorful and had a wonderful<br />\naroma; and the Applebarrel,<br />\nwhich was also rich in flavor<br />\nand quite nice.<br />\nAll in all, Haussner's proved<br />\nto be a pleasant dining experience. The prices are<br />\nreasonable and the portions<br />\ngenerous. The waitress was<br />\nfriendly and gave us good service. The restaurant is closed on<br />\nSundays and Mondays and<br />\nreservations for dinner are not<br />\naccepted. The most memorable<br />\nparts of the evening were,<br />\nwithout a doubt, the beautiful<br />\nartwork and glorious desserts.<br />\nIf any students should find<br />\nthemselves in the area, I recommend dining at Haussner's.<br /><br />\n3:<br />\n3!<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/15<br /><br />\nCrossword<br />\n1<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\nby Ron DeMatte\u00b0<br />\n15<br /><br />\nGreek goddess<br />\nBurden<br />\nFrodo's epic<br />\nSAT scorer<br />\nStrange startings<br />\nFlavoring<br />\nTeam follower<br />\n\"...the world<br />\nnot<br />\nwith a bang.. .\"\u2014Eliot<br />\n48 Lecture<br />\n51 Sci fi award<br />\n52 Waikiki wreath<br />\n55 '76 Olympic medalist<br />\n59 Recliner<br />\n60 Ye<br />\nInne<br />\n61 Wash cycle<br />\n62 Washington bills<br />\n63 Venison<br />\n64 Staves<br /><br />\nAwry<br />\nDiamond feature<br />\nHead, to Henri<br />\nPress<br />\nIts capital was Susa<br />\nFruit beverages<br />\nBar drinks<br />\nMap wds.<br />\nShakespeare villain<br />\nBridal path<br />\nLabels<br />\nMadison Ave. prod.<br />\nLessen<br />\nWord with print or<br />\nbonnet<br />\n29 Broadway sign<br />\n32 Chinese uprising-1899<br />\n35 Hautboy<br /><br />\n1<br />\n6<br />\n10<br />\n14<br />\n15<br />\n16<br />\n17<br />\n20<br />\n21<br />\n22<br />\n23<br />\n24<br />\n26<br />\n28<br /><br />\n19<br />\n17111118<br />\n20<br /><br />\n26<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\n25<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\n26<br /><br />\n47<br /><br />\ns2<br /><br />\n62<br /><br />\n6<br />\n4<br /><br />\n69<br /><br />\n63<br /><br />\n64<br /><br />\n65<br /><br />\n31<br /><br />\n34<br /><br />\n39<br /><br />\n40<br /><br />\nIII<br />\nIII<br />\n111<br />\nIllS<br />\nIII<br />\n41<br /><br />\n42<br /><br />\n45<br /><br />\n46<br /><br />\n49<br /><br />\n50<br /><br />\n47<br /><br />\nII<br /><br />\nIll<br /><br />\nElectrical units<br />\nThaw<br />\nActress Lupino, et al.<br />\nIniquity<br />\nSurfeit<br />\nGrowlers<br />\nMoreover<br />\nFool<br />\nAustralian bird<br />\nImplied<br />\nOld English letters<br />\nSesame<br />\nBeing<br />\nArdent<br /><br />\n51<br /><br />\n56<br /><br />\n52<br /><br />\n57<br /><br />\n58<br /><br />\n61<br />\n60111<br /><br />\n111<br /><br />\nDOWN<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n8<br />\n9<br />\n10<br />\n11<br />\n12<br />\n13<br />\n18<br /><br />\n30<br /><br />\n33III.<br />\n36<br />\n37<br /><br />\n44III<br /><br />\n62<br /><br />\n25<br /><br />\n29<br /><br />\n43<br /><br />\n48<br /><br />\n111<br /><br />\n28<br /><br />\n38<br /><br />\n59<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\n27<br /><br />\n22<br /><br />\n21<br /><br />\n24<br /><br />\n35<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\n21111<br /><br />\n32<br /><br />\n55<br /><br />\nlo u112<br />\nD 2E 3E 4s A 61, 14 s ODDS<br />\n':<br />\ni<br />\nAN<br />\nLEAP RER'U'N<br />\nRAM 16 141<br />\n1<br />\n17<br />\nIE\"SOFONE'1<br />\nDEC APSEI<br />\nSTAKE<br />\nDAHL 3<br />\nEARS<br />\nE<br />\n28<br />\n''DECADE<br />\n4<br />\n4\" 36<br />\n3132<br />\nLOUD<br />\nA 73A'\u00b0<br />\n40<br />\nELL; 39LI 0N MARIA<br />\n'<br />\nTIES<br />\nO\u0300 FT W0 44<br />\n'<br />\nT ALECI<br />\n46<br />\nE RSE ESTE<br />\n4EMEND<br />\nRENTE 4D6 \"YEL 3P ESD<br />\n\"<br />\nSPAA<br />\n4<br />\n''<br />\nI S E 5E<br />\n60<br />\nS<br />\nLS 1hr<br />\n61<br />\n4J0I9 N EVE<br />\n50<br />\n7<br />\nHREEMI<br />\nL ISLAND<br />\n67<br />\n;ADLY 'C'CA - A 7ALOE<br />\nRUSE ;MAN 'SOBS<br />\n'<br /><br />\n22<br /><br />\n11<br />\n23<br /><br />\nLast Week's Solution<br />\n1<br /><br />\n16<br /><br />\n141111<br /><br />\n36<br />\n37<br />\n38<br />\n43<br />\n44<br />\n45<br />\n46<br />\n47<br /><br />\nACROSS<br /><br />\n53<br /><br />\n54<br /><br />\n111<br /><br />\n1111<br /><br />\n64<br />\n63551<br /><br />\n19 Type of orange<br />\n23 Levied<br />\n24 The American Dream<br />\nauthor<br />\n25 Type of process<br />\n26 Monastery head<br />\n27 Rude ones<br />\n28 Hebrew letters<br />\n29 Emulates Belafonte<br />\n30 Stir up<br />\n31 Switch positions<br />\n33 Appraiser<br />\n34 Actress Anderson, and<br />\nothers<br />\n35 Red caper rave<br />\n39 Weasel kin<br /><br />\n1111<br /><br />\n40 Fief<br />\n41 Scope<br />\n42 Within<br />\n46 Betelgeuse and Arcturus<br />\n47 Swiss mathematician<br />\n48 Scandinavian capital<br />\n49 Downfall<br />\n50 Ex-Met Tommy<br />\n51 London park<br />\n52 A Turner<br />\n53 Formerly<br />\n54 April 13, e.g.<br />\n56 Angler's accessory<br />\n57 Lager<br />\nc8 Goose egg<br /><br />\nCHOICES: SEX &amp; RELATIONSHIPS<br />\n\u2022<br />\n* MELANIE, A COLLEGE SOPHOMORE,AGREED TO GO TO A FRATERNITY PARTY WITH JULIE, A FRIEND OF HERS,<br />\n* BECAUSE JULIE DIDN'T WANT TO GO ALONE.

ANDREA PARROT<br />\nTuesday, May 6<br />\n8:00 PM<br />\nL/V Room, Levering Hall<br />\nJHU<br /><br />\nThe Year in Review: The Ten B<br />\nIt has been, in many ways, an unusual academic year<br />\nfor Hopkins. At a school known for having a politically apathetic student body, protests and sit-ins became<br />\nalmost commonplace. At a school with a relatively<br />\nsmall campus, the administration announced it would<br />\nspend more than $200 million to expand in the next<br />\nfew years alone. At perhaps the nation's leading premed factory, the MCAT (the standard medical school<br />\nadmissions test) became optional.<br />\nIn other ways, though, it has been an utterly typical<br />\nyear. Tuition was increased almost $1000, the Student<br />\nCouncil feuded with the Student Activities Commission and WJHU suffered more delays on the road to<br />\nits much-discussed power boost.<br />\nAs a way of looking back at 1985-86, the Editor and<br />\nNews Editors of the News-Letter chose the year's 10<br />\nbiggest news events. All of them effected students,<br />\nfaculty members and administrators; some of them<br />\nchanged (or will change) the nature of Hopkins.<br />\nFirst on the list is the continuing controversy<br />\nthroughout the year about the University's investments<br />\nin corporations which do business in South Africa.<br />\nQuite Simply, no other story even came close to capturing as much attention as this one. Second are the<br />\nplague of bomb threats which struck the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Library this spring. Affecting almost every<br />\nstudent, the threats were a major disruption to campus life. Third is the continuing development (and<br />\ndelays) of WJHU, the University's radio station. The<br />\ncontroversy over Hopkins' attempted takeover of<br />\nWyman Park last fall is fourth. Although a compromise was eventually struck allowing the University to use part of the park, Hopkins was at odds with<br />\ncommunity leaders for some time. Fifth on the list is<br />\nthe $209 million bond issue Hopkins financed last fall,<br />\nwhile sixth is the report released in September on the<br />\nstatus of women at Hopkins. The inaugural Fall Break<br />\n(both its implementation and its subsequent disappointment) is seventh; eighth is the visit of South<br />\nAfrican Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu in January.<br />\nRounding out the list are the $800 tuition increase announced recently and the irregularities in the meal plan<br />\ncontract exposed last fall.<br />\nIn more detail, here is the complete list:<br /><br />\nSouth Africa<br />\nUndoubtedly, no issue has received as<br />\nmuch attention this<br />\nyear as the University's<br />\ninvestments in companies operating in South<br />\nAfrica. Almost from<br />\nthe first day of classes,<br />\nthe matter has been<br />\nheavily discussed by<br />\nstudents, faculty members and administrators. Along the way, an almost unprecedented level<br />\nof student activity developed: protests were staged at<br />\na Board of Trustees meeting, a boycott of classes was<br />\norganized and shanties and gulags were erected on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nIn the past, there have admittedly been some students<br />\ninvolved in political protests. Last year, for example,<br />\na few students demonstrated weekly in front of the<br />\nSouth African embassy in Washington. And there have<br />\ntraditionally been<br />\nprotests over the<br />\nUniversity's nuclear<br />\nweapons research.<br />\nBut in general, the<br />\nUniversity has never<br />\nbeen known as a<br />\nschool with a politically active student<br />\nbody. It is not, obviously, an Eastern<br />\nBerkeley. This year,<br />\nhowever, almost everyone seemed to get animated\u2014<br />\npositively or negatively\u2014about South African<br />\ndivestment.<br />\nThe issue came to the fore as early as late September,<br />\nwhen the Student Council voted to endorse a class<br />\nboycott organized by the Black Student Union. The<br />\nevent, held on October II, was part of a national protest called \"Free Prisoners of Apartheid Day.\" It<br />\ndidn't specifically focus on investments in South<br />\nAfrica, but there was still some discussion of the<br /><br />\nThe 10<br />\nBiggest<br />\nNews<br />\nEvents<br />\nof . . .<br />\nmatter.<br />\nA month later, South Africa was back in the news<br />\nas Hopkins graduate student Patrick Bond (later a major figure in the pro-divestment movement) orchestrated a campaign to convince Hopkins to assist<br />\nPatrick Naidoo, a South African medical student and<br />\npolitical refugee. Once again, the specific issue was not<br />\nthe University's investments, although the matter continued to be on everyone's mind.<br />\nIn January, as Hopkins prepared to welcome South<br />\nAfrican Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu, faculty<br />\nmembers, staff members and student groups\u2014most<br />\nprominently the Graduate Representative Organization<br />\nand the Black Student Union\u2014organized the Hopkins<br />\nCoalition for a Free South Africa. The group was<br />\nformed to push the University to divest itself of all<br />\nstocks of corporations which do business in South<br />\nAfrica. It argues that such American companies help<br />\nsupport apartheid (the system of racial separation in<br />\nSouth Africa), and that therefore it is immoral for the<br />\nUniversity to hold such stocks. The Coalition's first<br />\naction was to protest at the Tutu speech.<br />\nAs the spring wore on the Coalition grew, eventually<br />\norganizing a protest at a Board of Trustees meeting<br />\non Feb. 21, a sit-in in Garland Hall on April 4 and<br />\nthe building of a shanty on the lower quad. The shanty was built, according to Paul Genest, co-coordinator<br />\nof the Coalition, to \"symbolize the living conditions<br />\nof blacks in South Africa.\"<br />\nBut as the Coalition grew, so did opposition to it.<br />\nThe group's first setback came in February, when it<br />\nurged the Student Council to sign its \"Points of Unity,\" which advocated divestment. The council voted<br />\n10-9 against signing. (Although the vote was widely<br />\ninterpreted at the time as being a vote on divestment,<br />\nsome council members said later they objected to the<br />\npoints themselves, not divestment per se, and on April<br />\n9 the council voted 19-1 in favor of divestment.) The<br />\ncouncil also decided to hold a referendum of the student body. In a fairly large turn-out, 56 percent of<br />\nthose voting favored divestment.<br />\nAbout the same time, anti-divestment forces in the<br />\nstudent body began to emerge, as a new group\u2014<br />\nStudents for lnkatha\u2014appeared, and the College<br />\nRepublicans publicly argued against divestment. Both<br />\ngroups claimed divestment would actually hurt the<br />\nblacks of South Africa most. Anti-divestment pamphlets went up around campus, and when the Coalition built its shanty the Republicans answered by constructing a gulag, which they said symbolized what<br />\nwould happen to South Africa if the African National<br />\nCongress (which the Coalition supports) takes control<br />\nof South Africa. Last Sunday, the two sides met for<br />\nthe first time in a public debate.<br />\nThe administration's response to all this has been<br />\nmixed. Days before Tutu spoke, the University announced that the Board of Trustees had decided to sell<br />\nall stocks of corporations which operate in South<br />\nAfrica but are not signatories of the Sullivan Principles, a voluntary code of business practices. Since<br />\nthen, the Trustees have reportedly asked their Investbut<br />\nment Subcommittee to examine the issue further.,<br />\nPresident<br />\nUniversity<br />\naction.<br />\nhave taken no other<br />\nSteven Muller hassaid the Board is \"not of one mind.\"<br />\non the issue.<br /><br />\n6.<br /><br />\nR<br /><br />\n7. ma<br />\n8 Tut Spka<br />\n9.<br /><br />\nn Inc<br /><br />\n10. Meal Plan (<br />\nBomb Scare<br />\nA rash of bomb<br />\nthreats to the M.S.E.<br />\nLibrary interrupted<br />\nand threatened to paralyse the research efforts of many of the<br />\nUniversity's students<br />\nand faculty for a three<br />\nweek period earlier this<br />\nsemester.<br />\nIn all, nine different<br />\nthreats from an as yet<br />\nunapprehended caller or callers resulted in a series of<br />\nlibrary evacuations from February 16 to March 9, according to Manager of Campus Security Robert<br />\nLarkin.<br />\nLarkin recently told the News-Letter that the investigation is no longer \"ongoing,\" but that the case<br />\nis still open.<br />\nThe rash of threats began on Sunday, February 16<br />\nwhen a caller whose voice was described as that of a<br />\nmale in his twenties allegedly told an employee at the<br />\nlibrary that he hated that establishment and that he<br />\nhad planted a bomb on A-level, according to Larkin.<br />\nThe building was<br />\nimmediately evacuated and searched<br />\nby both Homewood<br />\nSecurity and the<br />\nBaltimore City Police, but nothing<br />\nwas found, and the<br />\nlibrary later reopened that night<br />\nwithout incident,<br />\naccording to security.<br />\nThe following<br />\nevening, the same scenario ensued. This time, the<br />\nlibrary received two threats and remained closed for<br />\nthe rest of the evening, although no bomb was ever<br />\nfound on the premises.<br />\nLarkin said at the time that at least one of the calls<br />\nwas made to a phone that is listed only in the University directory and that the calls apparently came from<br />\nsomewhere on the campus.<br />\nOn February 22, the library received yet another<br />\nthreat forcing the evacuation of M.S.E. once again.<br />\nZan Baughan, building manager of the library, said<br />\nat the time that three of the four recently received calls<br />\nwere made to the same telephone. Larkin eleborated<br />\nearlier security suspicions saying that Campus Security believed then that the calls were problably made<br />\nfrom on-campus, possibly even from inside the library<br />\nitself.<br />\nAccording to Larkin, the library employee who<br />\nanswered the phone described the caller as alledgedly<br />\nhaving a \"strange scratchy male voice.\"<br />\nAt the time of the February 22 threat, Library<br />\nBuilding Superintendant Henry Heath said that library<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/n<br /><br />\nBiggest News Stories of 1985-86<br />\ntments<br />\nibrary<br />\nf5s5wer<br />\nOr Wyman Park<br />\nsions<br />\nEx<br />\nen<br />\nak<br /><br />\nik<br />\nInc<br /><br />\ned $<br /><br />\nI Plan Contract<br />\nsecurity was remaining at a somewhat higher level than<br />\nusual. Package searches and extra guards were added<br />\nto improve the building's security.<br />\nOn March 2 three more threats were received, and<br />\non March 4, an additional threat was called in. 5'xurity<br />\nCoordinator Edward Weichert said at the time that the<br />\ndetails of all four were very similar. Each time a call<br />\nwas received, the caller alledgedly said, \"There's a<br />\nbomb in your library,\" according to Weichert.<br />\nThe library was evacuated and searched each time<br />\na threat was made, according to the security reports<br />\nof the incidents.<br />\nFinally, on March 9, the last of the recent wave of<br />\nbomb threats was received. This time, the library<br />\nemployee who took the call described the caller as<br />\nalledgedly having a female voice, according to Security<br />\nTraining Officer Orin Hughes.<br />\nHughes added that the wording of the threat was<br />\nreportedly similar to that of all the previous calls. In<br />\naddition, he said, \"In all the cases, attempts were made<br />\nto disguise the natural speaking voice of the caller.<br />\nRecently, Larkin said that he was happy to report<br />\nthat \"it appears that they [the threats] have stopped.\"<br /><br />\nWJHU<br />\nIf there were an<br />\naward for the most<br />\ndichotomous story of<br />\nthe year, the trials and<br />\ntribulations of WJHU<br />\nwould surely win it.<br />\nThroughout the<br />\nyear, plans have been<br />\nmade, staff members<br />\nhave been hired and<br />\nstudios have been constructed. But with every new accomplishment there seemed to come a new<br />\nsetback: another delay of the date for the station's<br />\nmuch discussed power increase.<br />\nEarly last fall, the station was scheduled to go on<br />\nthe air by March 17, when its extension from the<br />\nFederal Communications Commission expired. In<br />\nJanuary, however, General Manager David Creagh announced that deadline would not be<br />\nmet, and predicted<br />\na new start-up date<br />\nof early June.<br />\nSuch delays were<br />\nhardly new to<br />\nWJHU. Since the<br />\nFCC ruled several<br />\nyears ago that no<br />\nstations under 100<br />\nwatts would be allowed to operate,<br />\nthe station\u2014currently a 10 watt, student-run operation\u2014has been<br />\nplanning for a power boost, only to be plagued by<br />\nmany delays. Last summer, the University finally made<br />\na definitive decision to go ahead with the power in-<br /><br />\ncrease. Although many students had hoped the larger<br />\nstation would also be student-run, the administration<br />\nquickly announced it would hire professional staff<br />\nmembers for the station. David Creagh, previously the<br />\ngeneral manager of KLON-FM in Long Beach,<br />\nCalifornia, was then hired as the station's general<br />\nmanager.<br />\nCreagh immediately announced that only three positions would be set aside specifically for students, angering many workers at the 10-watt station who felt more<br />\nopportunities for students should be available. \"I will<br />\nnot operate on double standards,\" Creagh said. \"Positions are available to students on a competitive basis.\"<br />\nIn the fall, work really got underway on the larger<br />\nsiation, as a managerial team was slowly assembled,<br />\nan office building was leased and construction was<br />\nbegun on studios and a transmitter location was<br />\nchosen. In January, however, the station seemed to<br />\nsuffer two reversals: the delay until June was announced, and Creagh revealed the station would not broadcast at 25,000 watts (the figure traditionally discussed), but at 10,000. This was because the antenna will<br />\nbe higher than had been previously thought, allowing<br />\nthe lower wattage to reach the same size audience.<br />\nAbout the same time, a few students currently involved with the 10-watt station proposed the idea of<br />\na second Hopkins radio station. Once the<br />\nprofessionally-managed WJHU goes on the air, they<br />\nargued, a smaller, student-run station could be allowed to operate. Two principle alternatives were proposed: a normal broadcast station, or a \"carrier station,\"<br />\nwhich operates much like a closed-circuit TV station.<br />\nIn late January, University President Steven Muller<br />\nasked Dean of Administration Robert Welch to examine the idea of a second station; Welch has not yet<br />\nreported.<br />\nA few weeks later, the Student Council decided to<br />\ntake its own look at the problem, and formed an Ad<br />\nHoc Radio Committee. This week, it is distributing<br />\na survey among students to determine if there is significant interest in a second station.<br /><br />\nWyman Park<br />\nWhile Hopkins has<br />\nnever been known for<br />\nhaving a completely<br />\naffectionate relationship vis-a-vis the surrounding community,<br />\nthe situation became<br />\nfar worse last summer<br />\nand fall, as the University tried to expand<br />\ninto nearby Wyman<br />\nPark. Fierce opposition arose in the community, but in October a compromise was struck that seemed to please both sides.<br />\nThe whole affair began during the summer of 1985,<br />\nwhen University officials submitted a plan to the<br />\nBaltimore Parks Board to retake 40 acres of the park,<br />\nwhich is adjacent to the campus. The land had<br />\noriginally been owned by the University, but had been<br />\ngiven to the city between 1902 and 1926.<br />\nHopkins hoped<br />\nto construct several<br />\nbuildings on the<br />\nsite, including one<br />\nfor an outside research organization<br />\nwhich would engage<br />\nin joint ventures<br />\nwith the University.<br />\nOpposition to the<br />\nplan arose quickly,<br />\nculminating in Wyman Park Appreciation Day on<br />\nSept. 29. Community members argued the expansion<br />\nwould displace the park's wildlife, increase traffic in<br />\nthe area and change the water level, possibly causing<br />\nfuture flooding.<br />\n\"I just don't want to see it developed,\" stated City<br />\nCouncilman Anthony Ambridge, who represents the<br />\narea. \"It's just a beautiful, beautiful park.\"<br />\nIn response to all this, Mayor William Donald<br />\nSchaefer\u2014who had apparently originally encouraged<br />\nthe University to expand into the park\u2014appointed a<br />\ntask force to study the problem. The panel, composed of community leaders and University representatives, reported to the Mayor in late October.<br />\nIt recommended that a section of the park be leas-<br /><br />\ned to Hopkins to be used as an intramural athletic<br />\nfield, thereby allowing the University to build on its<br />\ncurrent intramural field, which abuts the park. Task<br />\nForce Chairman David Cordish, a Baltimore lawyer,<br />\nsaid this would preserve the park, since an athletic field<br />\nwould be far less disruptive than new buildings. The<br />\nplan won instant approval from both camps and the<br />\nMayor.<br /><br />\nBond Issue<br />\nIn what has been<br />\ncalled the largest program of its kind in the<br />\nhistor..y of Hopkins<br />\nand of the state, the<br />\nUniversity succeeded<br />\nlast semester in obtaining the necessary financing for a massive<br />\n$209 million construction and rennovation<br />\nproject for Homewood<br />\nand the University at large.<br />\nThe program which will soon change the face of the<br />\nUniversity will include, among other projects, the construction of three new research buildings for physics<br />\nand astronomy, geo-physics, and neuroscience; rennovations of Gilman, Remsen, and Ames; additions<br />\nI to Shaffer and the School of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth; unspecified improvements in student housing;<br />\nand the acquisition of a new building in Washington<br />\nfor the School of Advanced International Studies.<br />\nThe decision last semester to go ahead with one<br />\nmassive burst of construction was made primarily to<br />\nbeat expected federal legislation in<br />\nearly 1986 that<br />\nwould have eliminated the tax exempt status for such<br />\nproject financing.<br />\nAs University<br />\nPresident Steven<br />\nMuller said last fall,<br />\n\"A major tax law<br />\nrevision at this time<br />\nwould represent a<br />\nmajor risk in our<br />\nability to [complete our long term building and renovation goals].\"<br />\nMuller also remarked that the decision was partially based on a desire to continue attracting \"red hot<br />\nacademic research\" in the form of projects similar to<br />\nthe Space Telescope Science Institute, like the newly<br />\nplanned neuroscience and geo-physics buildings.<br />\nMost of the projects are slaked for ground breaking<br />\nfrom mid-1986 to 1987 with completion dates for all<br />\neighteen major projects scheduled before the end of<br />\nthe decade, according to Thomas McCracken, director of plant planning.<br />\nThe multi-million dollar package was financed by<br />\n$181 million in revenue bonds from the Maryland<br />\nHealth and Higher Education Facilities Authority.

Muller's recommendation was itself based on the recommendation of V. David VandeLinde,<br />\ndean of the G.W.C. Whiting School of Engineering,<br />\nand George Fisher, dean of the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nDuring a meeting with Student Council some months<br />\nlater, Muller defended the tuition hike saying, \"The<br />\ncosts in which we expect undergraduates to share are<br />\ngoing up.\" He added, \"After inflation, this represents<br />\na real increase of less than five percent.\"<br />\nMuller also cited increasing faculty salaries and improvements of \"academic as well as non-academic<br />\nfacilities\" as contributing to the higher costs. He added, \"It's impossible to have high quality instruction<br />\nwithout redoing aome of these facilities. The funds<br />\ncan't all come from gifts.\"<br />\nStudent Council President-Elect Mark Komisky<br />\ndefended Muller's position saying, \"I think the increase is quite appropriate,\" but added that he would<br />\nhave liked to have seen more funds spend on nonacademic facilities.<br />\nAt the meeting, Muller also presented a list of<br />\nschools ranked by 1985-86 tuition and showed that<br />\nHopkins was ranked as the 50th most expensive school<br />\namong them. \"My guess is we will stay in this position this year and for the indefinite future,\" commented Muller.<br />\nWhile Muller said that students receiving financial<br />\naid should not be affected by the increased tuition<br />\ncosts, he did express some concern over proposed<br />\nfederal budget cuts in education. \"The President's proposal for the federal budget once again calls for a<br />\nmassive reduction in some of the student aid programs. . . with the majority of these cuts affecting middle income Americans,\" he said.<br />\nHowever, Muller warned that the University budget<br />\ndoes not allow for extra expenditures in student aid<br />\nshould Congress approve these cuts in the case that<br />\nGramm-Rudman becomes effective.<br /><br />\nMeal Plan<br />\nStudents subscribing<br />\nto the ARA meal service have chronically<br />\ncomplained about the<br />\nquality of the food,<br />\nbut last November<br />\nmany started complaining about the<br />\nprice.<br />\nIn an investigative<br />\nreport first semester,<br />\nthe News-Letter reported the prices of the various meal plans, comparing them to the cost of buying meals on a daily basis.<br />\nIt was found that if students were on the 14 meal per<br />\nweek plan and did not attend intersession, they would<br />\nneed to eat 106.8 percent of their meals in order to<br />\nsave money, an obvious impossibility. The NewsLetter also showed that if the fourteen meal subscriber<br />\ndid attend intercession, he would have to eat 98.4 percent of his meals.<br />\nBettye Miller, director of Auxiliary Enterprises said<br />\nat the time that the costs of \"casual\" meals and the<br />\nmeal plans could not be compared. Miller added that<br />\n\"We do not base its [the meal plan's] cost on the casual<br />\nmeal rate. There is no rationale to it.\"<br />\nMiller also said that the meal plan costs could not<br />\nbe lowered, saying, \"to lower the cost of the meal plan<br />\nwould be to lower the quality of the food. They would<br />\nserve sawdust if they had to.\"<br />\nAlthough admitting that few people eat in the Terrace Room on a casual basis, Miller added that raising the prices of the casual meals would discourage<br />\nthe few who did attend on a daily basis.<br />\nFurther investigation of the meal plan prices revealed an even greater disparity in the differences of price<br />\nbetween the meal plans and the casual rates. It was<br />\nfound that since the 19 meal plan subscribers ate only<br />\n75 percent of their meals they were paying an average<br />\nof $3.89 per meal if they attended intercession and<br />\n$4.23 if they didn't.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/19<br />\n*************************************************<br />\n4(<br />\n4(<br />\n**<br />\n4(<br />\n4(<br /><br />\n**<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n**<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n:<br />\n:<br /><br />\nThe JEW Barnstormers<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\npresent<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n**<br />\n4,<br />\n:<br />\nir* A Midsummer Night's Dream :<br />\n4,<br />\n4,<br />\n4,<br />\n4,<br />\n4,<br />\n4,<br />\n4, May 2,3,4<br />\n*<br />\n:<br />\n*<br />\n* L/V Room 8pm<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br /><br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n$2.00 advance:<br />\n**<br />\n$3.00 door<br />\n:<br />\n:<br />\n:<br /><br />\n*<br />\n\u2022<br />\n*Ttckets now on sale at the Union Desk*<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/25<br /><br />\nience<br />\nGoodbye Sphygmomanometer; Hello Robotron<br />\nby Joseph Gergyes<br />\nInvestigators at the Johns<br />\nHopkins School of Public<br />\nHealth have come up with a<br />\nnovel method for screening<br />\nchildren for high blood pressure<br />\nrisk: make them play video<br />\ngames.<br />\nCraig K.

Never in his AllAmerica days at St. Mary's<br />\nhigh school nor at Hopkins has<br />\nBubier put so many into the<br />\nnet.<br />\nHe was, to state it simply,<br />\nunstoppable. He scored off fast<br />\nbreaks, he scored from outside,<br />\nbut mostly he bullied his way<br />\naround inside and drilled shots<br />\ndown goalie Joe Donnelly's<br />\nthroat. The scary thing is that<br />\neveryone agreed that Bubier<br />\ncan play even better. \"There's<br />\nmore to the game than scoring<br />\ngoals,\" he said. It's a helluva<br />\nstart though.<br />\nOne thing's for sure; he<br />\ndidn't do it without a lot of<br />\nhelp. Seven of Bubier's goals<br />\nwere assisted, which speaks<br />\nvolumes about the Blue Jay<br />\nway. When a Hopkins player<br />\nexplodes like Bubier did, it is<br />\nmore by chance than by design.<br />\n\"He did a great job getting in<br />\nthe right place at the right<br />\ntime,\" said Brian Wood,\"but<br />\nI've seen him have better<br />\ngames.\" Wood should know;<br />\nthe two have been teammates<br />\nfor seven years.<br />\nHopkins needed all they<br />\ncould muster on this day. Navy<br />\njumped out to a 4-1 lead in the<br />\n2nd quarter, lost the advantage,<br />\nbut then stayed within striking<br />\ndistance till the end. The Jays<br />\nnever led by more than three.<br />\nLost in all the hoopla was the<br />\ngreat day that Wood turned in.<br />\nHe shook off yet another<br />\ndefense that just let him breathe<br /><br />\nGanesh Ramachandran<br /><br />\nJohn DeTommaso fights off Navy's Paul Basile near the Blue Jay cage as goalie Stu Jones<br />\nlooks on.<br /><br />\nand little else to score 3 .goals<br />\nand 3 assists. Del Dressel was<br />\nalso sharp, although the stats<br />\nwon't show it(1 goal, 3 assists).<br />\nOnce again, Dressel seemed to<br />\nbe on top of every groundball<br />\n(he picked up 11) and generally just dominated the midfield.<br />\nAll he didn't do was score big,<br />\nand that was only because Donnelly seemed to make a great<br />\nsave every time he shot.<br /><br />\nMidfielder Brendan Kelly<br />\npaid the price for his big day<br />\nagainst Maryland two weeks<br />\nago. Navy coach Brian Matthews must have looked at films<br />\nof the 5'9\" 150 pounder and<br />\ndecided that the best strategy<br />\nwas to have his defenders<br />\nknock him around whenever he<br />\ngot the ball. Kelly still tallied a<br />\ngoal and 2 assists, but certainly paid the price.<br /><br />\nBruce Chanenchuk and Steve<br />\nMitchell, a couple of players<br />\nwho don't get much ink, both<br />\nturned in particularly good<br />\ngames, although you won't see<br />\nit one the stat sheet. On paper,<br />\nChanenchuk only had one<br />\nassist, but this won't tell you<br />\nhow his speed in the offensive<br />\nend created several opportunities. Mitchell got beaten<br />\nbadly by Navy's Glenn Miles<br />\nearly, but then buckled down<br />\nand showed how awesome someone with his physical tools<br />\ncan be. When Brad McLam, his<br />\nlong stick partner on the rope,<br />\nwent down with a serious knee<br />\ninjury, Mitchell seemed to raise<br />\nhis level of play a notch. He did<br />\nthe thin.s that McLam usuall<br /><br />\nexcels at, like picking up thegroundball off of faceoffs and<br />\nigniting the fast break.<br />\nDefensively, the Jays have<br />\nplayed better. They had trouble<br />\ncontrolling Miles, who had 4<br />\ngoals, but then again everybody<br />\nhas this year. John DeTommaso had one spectacular play,<br />\nmaking a chest save on what<br />\nlooked like an easy Navy goal<br />\nwith Stu Jones out of the crease,<br />\nand otherwise dominated as<br />\nusual. His linemates, Dan<br />\nPallace and Jon Krome didn't<br />\nget burned, but didn't cause<br />\nmany loose balls either.<br />\nThe unknown factor in<br />\nHopkins' run for a 3rd straight<br />\ntitle may well be freshman<br />\ndefenseman Dave Pietramala.<br />\nA highly touted recruit.<br />\nPietramala missed half the<br />\nseason and then didn't see extensive action until Saturday. With<br />\nMcLam on the shelf, Pietramala<br />\nwill play a key role down the<br />\nstretch. Against Navy, he<br />\nplayed a lot on the rope and<br />\nlooked impressive.<br />\nAt the outset, the game looked like a duel of the keepers,<br />\nwith Navy's Donnelly and<br />\nHopkins' Jones making save<br />\nafter save. Bubier had a good<br />\nshot 45 seconds into the game,<br />\nbut hit the post, about the only<br />\ntime he'd miss all day. Navy<br />\nmanaged to score the only goal<br />\nof the period; Bob Wehman on<br />\nan assist from Frank Snyder at<br />\n5:02.<br />\nJones made a big save early<br />\nin the second quarter, but it<br />\nturned into a costly sequence as<br />\nthe Jays cleared but McLam<br />\nwent down. The diagnosis was<br />\nknee ligament damage, and he<br />\nhad arthroscopic surgery on<br />\nSunday.,.<br />\nA minute later, Bubier put<br />\nHopkins on the board. Mike<br />\nMorrill ran towards the net<br />\nalone on the left, and when he<br />\nwas picked up found Bubier<br />\nparked in front of the crease for<br />\nan easy score. The Jays problem this year has been relaxing after they score and letting<br />\nContinued on Page 30<br /><br />\nop ins vs. owson<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nWhere: Homewood Field<br />\nWhen: Saturday, 2:00 p.m.<br /><br />\nJess Bunshatt<br /><br />\nThe Jays had to survive some tough hits, and perhaps an extra long stick, to get out with the win.<br /><br />\nCoverage: WJHU, 88.1 FM.<br />\nPreview: On paper, this game looks like a mismatch.<br />\nHopkins is No. 1, 8-1, and has played every top<br />\n8 team besides C.

Don Zimmerman had seen enough, and called timeout midway through the<br />\nperiod to get his team going. It<br />\ntook a minute and a half, but<br />\nthen the tide finally turned, not<br />\non a goal but on perhaps the<br />\ndefensive play of the season.<br />\nWith the ball loose behind<br />\nthe net, Jones left the cage and<br />\nwas promptly knocked down.<br />\nMiles picked it up and fed out<br />\nin front for what looked like a<br />\n.sure goal. John DeTommaso<br />\nwould have none of it, as he<br />\njumped in front of the net and<br />\nblocked the shot with his chest,<br />\nand then collapsed to smother<br />\nthe ball. If you could pick a<br />\nsingle play that ignited the Jays,<br />\nthis would have to be the one.<br />\nAt 10:18, Hopkins began to<br />\nrally. In a man-up situation,<br />\nWood took a pass from Dressel<br />\nand cranked in a 15 yd. bounce<br />\nshot.

At 3:10, Bruce Chanen-<br /><br />\nlights out for the sinking Midshipmen. Unfortunately, at<br />\n7:45 they scored a \"bad\" goal<br />\nand found new life.

Hopkins<br />\ncomes back. Dressel levels a<br />\nNavy defensemen trying to<br />\nclear and the ball bounces to<br />\nBubier, who feeds Kelly all<br />\nalone in front. It's 10-8 and<br />\nHopkins has momentum.<br />\nAt 6:05, Miles gets a pass<br />\nfrom Paul Basile and fires in a<br />\nlong one that takes about 1<br />\nmicrosecond to go from stick to<br />\nback of net. At 8:18, Bubier<br />\nresurfaces, hitting a fallaway<br />\nshot from the left side. Navy<br />\nwins the faceoff though, and<br />\ngets a fastbreak. Just 12<br />\nseconds later, Hanzsche scores<br />\nfrom Basile to pull within<br />\n11-10. Joe Rzempoluch takes<br /><br />\nthe ensuing faceoff, gets the<br />\nball to Dressel, and then the cocaptain blows by his man and<br />\nfires in. Navy then wins the<br />\nnext draw, but the clock<br />\ndoesn't move.
