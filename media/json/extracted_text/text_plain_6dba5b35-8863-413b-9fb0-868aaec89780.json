The<br />\nnearest we have to the real nightingale in this<br />\ncountry is our Southern mockingbird with its<br />\npathetic and thrilling song.<br />\nWe had read Keat's wonderful \"Ode to the<br />\nNightingale\" before we first wandered to Bagley<br />\nWoods outside of Oxford, in the early twilight<br />\nto hear the nightingale sing. Here it was that<br />\nMatthew Arnold used to hear them sing in his<br />\nstudent days. From middle May to middle June<br />\nis their singing season and only at night.<br />\nWe heard the strange solemn cuckoos in the<br />\nwoods, like cuckoo clocks, as we walked out to<br />\nthe haunts of the nightingales. It was dusk<br />\nwhen we came to the deep woods and all was<br />\nstill. There must be perfect silence, or the birds<br />\nwill not sing. Even a footfall stops them<br />\ninstantly. We waited and listened. Presently<br />\nwe heard a tremor of song which grew in clearness and volume. We watched and peered to see<br />\nthe bird,\u2014and there he sat on the tip of a bough<br />\nclearly defined between us and the moon. And<br />\nhow he sang! A wonderful melody,\u2014sad, passionate, full of tears, as if his little heart would<br />\nbreak. It was the bubbling forth of a fountain,<br />\nliquid warbling, full of love and pathos. It<br />\nseemed not a bird, but the sweet sorrow of a<br />\nhuman spirit. We felt on that balmy night as if<br />\nwe were listening to the love confession of a<br />\nbroken heart, and yet there was sweetness,joy<br />\nand exultancy in it. It was a perfect glory of<br />\nong.<br />\n<br />\nNo. 3.<br />\n<br />\nThe coming of the month brings the singing of<br />\nthe carol from the tower of Magdalen College on<br />\nMay morning. This is an immemorial custom<br />\ndating from the time of King Henry VII who<br />\nleft money for its maintenance, and it is still<br />\nkept up every year on the first of May at five<br />\no'clock in the morning.<br />\nMagdalen Tower is the most beautiful tower<br />\nin Oxford, and it never looks better than at sunrise on a May morning, with the white-robed<br />\nchoristers gathered in its top singing their Latin<br />\ncarol.<br />\nWe got up before sunrise, just as the cocks<br />\nwere crowing, and wandered down to Magdalen<br />\nBridge. The air was fresh and still. Here and<br />\nthere smoke was curling out of a chimney. The<br />\ndew was on the grass. The 1?irds were singing.<br />\nThere were some booths along the street near<br />\nthe college to serve coffee and cake to the early<br />\nrisers. Probably a couple of thousand people<br />\ngathered on the bridge belo x the tower on this<br />\nmorning.<br />\nJust at five o'clock the college bell sounded,<br />\nand at the last stroke the singing began. It was<br />\nin Latin. But beautifully rendered by the forty<br />\nvoices of the Magdalen choir,\u2014the best choir in<br />\nOxford.<br />\nAs the hymn ceased, the sun was true to expectations, and burst forth above the hills, and all<br />\ntke college bells in Oxford began to ring most<br />\njoyously. Here and there they would chime;<br />\nhere and there jangle; but all in rapturous glee<br />\non this May morning. It was the festival of<br />\nSpring. It was the Spring thanksgiving to God<br />\nfor all the returning life and beauty of the year.<br />\nThen another part of the ceremony. The choir<br />\nwho were in cap and gown took off their caps<br />\nand flung them out from the tower, careering<br />\nthrough the air zig-zag to the green sward<br />\nbelow. And after these,the gowns came fluttering down in the same way. Immediately everybody, students and town-folk, began to wander<br />\ninto the fields and the woods, with tooting<br />\nhorns and rollicking songs to gather the wild<br />\nflowers. For in England at the first of May the<br />\nfields around Oxford were full of flowers, and it<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nFABLES FOR THE FOOLISH.<br />\nwas a real picture of Merry England to see the<br />\nboys and girls, and the youths and maidens<br />\nwandering off gaily into the fields singing,shoutAnother time, the young animals, profoundly<br />\ning and trumpeting on May morning.

The severe and<br />\npublic criticism which has been directed toward<br />\nus through the medium of the city press has<br />\nhumiliated us beyond measure, and whether the<br />\ncharges be true or false, we feel that the good<br />\nname of the University has suffered.<br />\nThe first outward sign of trouble appeared on<br />\nElection Day in the dispute between Manager<br />\nBooker and the manager of the Physicians and<br />\nSurgeons team over the right of Penton in the<br />\nP. and S. line-up. The disagreement, while it<br />\ncreated bad feeling between the two colleges and<br />\nshowed the management in a bad light before<br />\nthe spectators was, probably, the result of an<br />\nimperfect understanding, and is done with. But<br />\non the heels of this a member of the Baltimore<br />\nMedical College charged our athletic representatives with attempting to \"fix\" beforehand the<br />\nscore of a game scheduled with his school. Manager Booker has denied all connection with any<br />\nsuch arrangement,and Mr. Mackdermott asserts<br />\nthat a proposal to \"fix\" the score was made,<br />\nnot by any Hopkins man, but by the very man<br />\nwho brings the accusation. Mr. Mackdermott<br />\nadmits that he did consider the proposition from<br />\nthe standpoint of the financial possibilities<br />\npointed out to him,but insists that the first sug_<br />\ngestion of the matter came from the Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nMedical College. In an open letter the very next<br />\nday the correspondent from the B. M. C. flatly<br />\ndenies this,and also challenges statements made<br />\nby Mr. Booker. Thisis the status of the controversy at the present writing, expressed in few<br />\nwords.<br />\nThe Executive Committee of the Athletic Association has determined to investigate the matter, and awaiting the result of its investigation,<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER will attempt no deductions<br />\nand pass no judgments. By the time that this<br />\npaper is issued,the findings of the committee will<br />\nprobably have been made known.<br />\nThe truth, and the whole truth, is what the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER and all the student body demand.<br />\nThe charges made against our representatives,<br />\nwhile by no means criminal, are, nevertheless,<br />\nsomething unheard of at Johns Hopkins, and if<br />\nfound true, will immeasurably decrease our influence in the work of promoting bona-fide student<br />\nathletics, the cause which we have been professedly championing in this city. If the accusation<br />\nbe false, this fact will be welcomed by all lovers<br />\nof true sport, and will be given all possible publicity. If it be true, let us declare it, assert the<br />\nstrongest disapproval of the student body as a<br />\nviolation of University traditions, place the<br />\nblame exactly where it belongs, and then drop<br />\nthe subject forever. But let us by no means<br />\nattempt to conceal the truth. There are in the<br />\ncity and State many persons who are ready to<br />\ncriticise us on any pretext. The eyes of these<br />\npeople and of the whole athletic element of the<br />\ncity are upon us now. We must not let these<br />\nsay that we are doing something of which we<br />\nare ashamed. If we have sinned against the<br />\nethical code, it is a matter of keen regret, but<br />\nnot a matter for discouragement.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER desires to state that this<br />\nbusiness, if it prove to be as asserted, in no way<br />\nrepresents Hopkins ideals, nor reflects Hopkins<br />\nsentiment, and while earnestly desiring the vindication of our representatives, the NEWS-LETTER feels that it will be more to the honor of<br />\nthe University to assert the plain facts without<br />\nprejudice than to attempt to suppress the slightest detail. .<br />\n611.W<br />\nIs not the NEWS-LETTER justified in drawing<br />\n<br />\n\f414<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nIf<br />\n<br />\nthe conclusion that much of this trouble is due<br />\nindirectly to the policy of confining our athletic<br />\nefforts outside of the Maryland Intercollegiate<br />\nAssociation exclusively to one or two colleges of<br />\nquestionable amateur status or at least, of comparative obscurity of reputation? The championship of the Association is a worthy aim;<br />\nbut asidefrom thisfact, why should there be such<br />\na senrcity of opponents as to compel us to play<br />\nth- same teams over and over again? It has<br />\nbecm shown that the finest and best known colleges in the South are ready to arrange dates<br />\nwith us at any time. Some of these teams are<br />\ntoo heavy for our men, but there are many<br />\nwhom we could meet on fair terms, and with<br />\nwhom it would be an honor to play, with no<br />\noccasion for undignified bickerings over disqualified players. We have defeated Delaware<br />\nCollege and the College of Physicians and Surgeons with comparative ease, and have gotten<br />\nall the prestige that was coming to us; are there<br />\nso few other colleges that we must risk the loss<br />\nof our advantage by meeting the same teams<br />\nagain? To defeat these two institutions was<br />\nsome honor; to be defeated by them now would<br />\nbe to lose more than we have gained. We have<br />\ngotten into difficulty and lost some standing by<br />\nour second encounter with P. and S.; let us hope<br />\nfor no further trouble this Saturday against<br />\nDelaware.<br />\nwww<br />\nIt has already been announced in this paper<br />\nthat a strong representation is desired at Annapolis on the 24th of this month, when our<br />\nteam plays St. John's College for the Maryland<br />\nIntercollegiate Championship. The championship was won last fall nearly as much through<br />\nthe efforts of the rooters as through the skill of<br />\nthe team. A victory on that stony mountain<br />\nslope at Westminster last November without<br />\nthe encouragement produced by the presence of<br />\nthose ninety or more Hopkins men on the side<br />\nlines was problematical indeed. A hundred men<br />\nshould go to Annapolis. Special rates will be<br />\nobtained, and a fine time can be had. The Chief<br />\nRooter is taking the names of all desiring to go.<br />\n<br />\nopinion may feel that they have shown the<br />\nproper spirit of college men at such a time.<br />\nActive participation in the campaign for the purpose of promoting what are deemed the best<br />\ninterests of the country is the privilege and duty<br />\nof every college man who feels that his studies<br />\nhave helped him to clearer understanding of the<br />\nissues involved. Secretary Hackett said truly<br />\nthat we have no use for the man who takes no<br />\npart in a national election except to criticise the<br />\ncandidates.

He clattered his heels along the<br />\nfloor, opened the door with a push and let it<br />\nswing to with a resounding bang. The incident<br />\nwas significant not only of the slight regard<br />\nsome men have for the accepted etiquette of such<br />\npublic places, but in drawing attention to character as revealed in the little things of conduct.<br />\nThere was a self-assurance, a self appreciation,<br />\nan eloquent importance in the rattling of those<br />\nheels and the banging of that door past all<br />\nmistaking.<br />\nww<br />\nThe general desertion of Seniors from the<br />\nDean's course in Logic on Election day was interesting. Two or three men who lived up<br />\ncountry and had to go home to vote were properly entitled to the absence. Perhaps there were<br />\nothers detained by equally patriotic duties, but<br />\nit is a safe guess that a fine majority of those<br />\nwho were compelled to miss the Dean that day<br />\nhave as yet to assume the real burdens of citizenship. The excuses made to the good doctor<br />\nthe day following were doubtless luminous and<br />\nsufficient. There is no telling how far the Senior was responsible for the momentous work of<br />\nthe sixth of November. It would only be accusing him of a pardonable return to his prep.<br />\ndays to conjecture that he had to snagboxesfor<br />\nthe evening's bon-fire. Again, the A E I 0 U's<br />\nof the Dean's logical formulu may have had<br />\nmore to do with the emptying of the class chairs<br />\nthan any other \"paramount issue.\" One of<br />\nthese days some ambitious student may set<br />\nabout determining the period in an undergraduate's life when he ceases to take advantage of<br />\na fair opening for an excusable \"cut.\"<br />\nw<br />\nHopkins men take little stock in Public Aid,<br />\nCharity, and Correction if their absence from<br />\nthe first of Dr. Brackett's lectures is worth<br />\nanything in evidence. As this is the only work<br />\nin Sociology offered at the University the matter<br />\nis the more notable. While the course is well<br />\nattended by an interested public, three undergraduates and as few graduate students repre-<br />\n<br />\nsented the University. Aside from the technical<br />\nvalue of these lectures it is not incredible that<br />\nthey would go a long way in enriching the life<br />\nof the student himself, as a member of the great<br />\nbrotherhood, with a share in the responsibility<br />\nwe all have to shoulder in setting right some of<br />\nthis old world's social disorder. It is an old<br />\ntime cry that the student, shutting himself up<br />\nin his study shuts himself off too much from life<br />\nabout him, that he may as well be bound in<br />\nsheep, labeled Vol,. MXXIX and ranged along<br />\nthe shelf with the cobwebs. The political economists have some time since been driven outfrom<br />\ntheir oil-smelling dens, and we have in our own<br />\nDr. Hollander a stirring example of a student<br />\nwho has put up his books for a time while he<br />\nperforms a notable public service. It is a movement as prophetic as it is gratifying. With the<br />\nsame spirit, if in less degree, every student<br />\nshould contribute what he can in solving these<br />\npressing problems of every-day life. Dr. Brackett, himself a Hopkins graduate,is utterly qualified to present his subject,a man offetching personality and contagious enthusiasm. It would<br />\nbe a mighty good thing if more of our men<br />\nwould put themselves under his influence for the<br />\nremaining Tuesday afternoons.<br />\nser W<br />\n<br />\nTHE KENTUCKY COLONELS.<br />\n\"The Kentucky Colonels and Judges Association of the University held its regular conclave<br />\nat Gordon's, last Friday night.

Western Maryland<br />\nhad been reported unusually strong this year,<br />\nand when she succeeded in defeating Gallaudet<br />\nby the score of 16 to 5, some apprehension<br />\nwas felt on the part of the Hopkins team. In<br />\nSaturday's game, however, the Black and Blue<br />\ncompletely outplayed their opponents in every<br />\npoint. Western Maryland's punting was feeble,<br />\ntheir interference poor, their fumbles numerous,<br />\nand the team work much slower and decidedly<br />\ninferior to ours. A rainy day kept away many<br />\nwho would otherwise have come.

M. H. Rowland's scandalous charges<br />\nagainst Hopkins' foot-ball representatives appeared in the Baltimore News as an answer to<br />\nan earlier letter by Manager Booker in the same<br />\npaper. This letter of Mr. Booker's cited reasons<br />\nfor the cancellation of the Johns Hopkins-Baltimore Medical College Election day game. It is<br />\nconceded that this letter opened the scandal by<br />\ncalling forth Dr. Rowland's charge. The report<br />\nto which I object names me as the author of the<br />\nletter. It is misleading. My sole connection<br />\nwith the matter was of this rather dissenting<br />\nnature:<br />\nManager Booker brought me a letter about<br />\nten days ago which he wished to print in The<br />\nNews. The letter condemned the foot-ball organization of the Medical College, criticised the<br />\ncollege faculty,and censured the college students.<br />\nI asked Mr. Booker if Mr. Mackdermott knew<br />\nabout the letter. Mr. Booker replied that Mr.<br />\nMackdermott knew its contents and approved<br />\nits publication. Since Mr. Booker brought the<br />\nletter to me as a Hopkins man rather than a reporter, I felt justified in criticising it.<br />\nI told him at once and shortly that I disapproved it and considered it intemperate in its<br />\npartisanship and superfluous in its scope. I<br />\ntold him that if he and Mr. Mackdermott<br />\nwanted to tell the public why a game was cancelled they had best narrow their words to that<br />\n<br />\n(<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\none matter without wandering aside to give<br />\nneedless offence. As a man of sense Mr. Booker<br />\naccepted this as sensible advice without demur.<br />\nAn hour later he brought me a second letter.<br />\nI considered it an improvement on the first, but<br />\nthought it still contained sentences to no better<br />\npurpose than the aggravation of a dispute. He<br />\nread the letter over and agreed with me again.<br />\n\"But what is to be said then ?\" he asked.<br />\n\"If anything must be said at all,\"I answered,<br />\n\"say just why the game was cancelled and no<br />\nmore.\"<br />\nWe then went to a table and I wrote on the<br />\nbacks of the sheets of the letter what I thought<br />\nsuch a paper should contain. I gave the sheets<br />\nto Mr. Booker to use as he liked. Three or four<br />\ndays later a letter from him was received by the<br />\nSporting Editor of The News and printed.<br />\nSome sections of it were like some I had written; its other parts were quite diffk:rent from<br />\nany of mine. To Mr. Booker's credit, this final<br />\nletter was justly explanatory and less provocative of bad feeling than that which he and Mr.<br />\nMackdermott read together.<br />\nI myself never suggested or favored the printing of any letter. The letter which appeared<br />\nwas not of my writing. Concerning the wisdom<br />\nor folly of it, I won't presume to express an<br />\nopinion. If its results are beneficial there is no<br />\nblame. If its results are bad I trust that all of<br />\nus will consider carefully where lies the fault<br />\nbefore imputing it to anybody.<br />\nVery trilly yours,<br />\nZed MARSHALL BALLARD.<br />\nW W sr<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University and College of<br />\nPhysicians and Surgeons foot-ball teams occupied boxes at the Auditorium, Election night.<br />\nNo arrests were made.<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nHorace Gillespie, end on the 'Varsity, has<br />\nbeen elected captain of the foot-ball team of<br />\nNaughty-Two.

The<br />\nnearest we have to the real nightingale in this<br />\ncountry is our Southern mockingbird with its<br />\npathetic and thrilling song.<br />\nWe had read Keat's wonderful \"Ode to the<br />\nNightingale\" before we first wandered to Bagley<br />\nWoods outside of Oxford, in the early twilight<br />\nto hear the nightingale sing. Here it was that<br />\nMatthew Arnold used to hear them sing in his<br />\nstudent days. From middle May to middle June<br />\nis their singing season and only at night.<br />\nWe heard the strange solemn cuckoos in the<br />\nwoods, like cuckoo clocks, as we walked out to<br />\nthe haunts of the nightingales. It was dusk<br />\nwhen we came to the deep woods and all was<br />\nstill. There must be perfect silence, or the birds<br />\nwill not sing. Even a footfall stops them<br />\ninstantly. We waited and listened. Presently<br />\nwe heard a tremor of song which grew in clearness and volume. We watched and peered to see<br />\nthe bird,\u2014and there he sat on the tip of a bough<br />\nclearly defined between us and the moon. And<br />\nhow he sang! A wonderful melody,\u2014sad, passionate, full of tears, as if his little heart would<br />\nbreak. It was the bubbling forth of a fountain,<br />\nliquid warbling, full of love and pathos. It<br />\nseemed not a bird, but the sweet sorrow of a<br />\nhuman spirit. We felt on that balmy night as if<br />\nwe were listening to the love confession of a<br />\nbroken heart, and yet there was sweetness,joy<br />\nand exultancy in it. It was a perfect glory of<br />\nong.<br /><br />\nNo. 3.<br /><br />\nThe coming of the month brings the singing of<br />\nthe carol from the tower of Magdalen College on<br />\nMay morning. This is an immemorial custom<br />\ndating from the time of King Henry VII who<br />\nleft money for its maintenance, and it is still<br />\nkept up every year on the first of May at five<br />\no'clock in the morning.<br />\nMagdalen Tower is the most beautiful tower<br />\nin Oxford, and it never looks better than at sunrise on a May morning, with the white-robed<br />\nchoristers gathered in its top singing their Latin<br />\ncarol.<br />\nWe got up before sunrise, just as the cocks<br />\nwere crowing, and wandered down to Magdalen<br />\nBridge. The air was fresh and still. Here and<br />\nthere smoke was curling out of a chimney. The<br />\ndew was on the grass. The 1?irds were singing.<br />\nThere were some booths along the street near<br />\nthe college to serve coffee and cake to the early<br />\nrisers. Probably a couple of thousand people<br />\ngathered on the bridge belo x the tower on this<br />\nmorning.<br />\nJust at five o'clock the college bell sounded,<br />\nand at the last stroke the singing began. It was<br />\nin Latin. But beautifully rendered by the forty<br />\nvoices of the Magdalen choir,\u2014the best choir in<br />\nOxford.<br />\nAs the hymn ceased, the sun was true to expectations, and burst forth above the hills, and all<br />\ntke college bells in Oxford began to ring most<br />\njoyously. Here and there they would chime;<br />\nhere and there jangle; but all in rapturous glee<br />\non this May morning. It was the festival of<br />\nSpring. It was the Spring thanksgiving to God<br />\nfor all the returning life and beauty of the year.<br />\nThen another part of the ceremony. The choir<br />\nwho were in cap and gown took off their caps<br />\nand flung them out from the tower, careering<br />\nthrough the air zig-zag to the green sward<br />\nbelow. And after these,the gowns came fluttering down in the same way. Immediately everybody, students and town-folk, began to wander<br />\ninto the fields and the woods, with tooting<br />\nhorns and rollicking songs to gather the wild<br />\nflowers. For in England at the first of May the<br />\nfields around Oxford were full of flowers, and it<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nFABLES FOR THE FOOLISH.<br />\nwas a real picture of Merry England to see the<br />\nboys and girls, and the youths and maidens<br />\nwandering off gaily into the fields singing,shoutAnother time, the young animals, profoundly<br />\ning and trumpeting on May morning.

U.; or box 398, Medical School of<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital.<br /><br />\nThere is without doubt, nothing which has<br />\nhappened in recent years that has provoked such<br />\ngeneral feeling at the University as the deplorable events of the past week. The severe and<br />\npublic criticism which has been directed toward<br />\nus through the medium of the city press has<br />\nhumiliated us beyond measure, and whether the<br />\ncharges be true or false, we feel that the good<br />\nname of the University has suffered.<br />\nThe first outward sign of trouble appeared on<br />\nElection Day in the dispute between Manager<br />\nBooker and the manager of the Physicians and<br />\nSurgeons team over the right of Penton in the<br />\nP. and S. line-up. The disagreement, while it<br />\ncreated bad feeling between the two colleges and<br />\nshowed the management in a bad light before<br />\nthe spectators was, probably, the result of an<br />\nimperfect understanding, and is done with. But<br />\non the heels of this a member of the Baltimore<br />\nMedical College charged our athletic representatives with attempting to \"fix\" beforehand the<br />\nscore of a game scheduled with his school. Manager Booker has denied all connection with any<br />\nsuch arrangement,and Mr. Mackdermott asserts<br />\nthat a proposal to \"fix\" the score was made,<br />\nnot by any Hopkins man, but by the very man<br />\nwho brings the accusation. Mr. Mackdermott<br />\nadmits that he did consider the proposition from<br />\nthe standpoint of the financial possibilities<br />\npointed out to him,but insists that the first sug_<br />\ngestion of the matter came from the Baltimore<br /><br />\nMedical College. In an open letter the very next<br />\nday the correspondent from the B. M. C. flatly<br />\ndenies this,and also challenges statements made<br />\nby Mr. Booker. Thisis the status of the controversy at the present writing, expressed in few<br />\nwords.<br />\nThe Executive Committee of the Athletic Association has determined to investigate the matter, and awaiting the result of its investigation,<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER will attempt no deductions<br />\nand pass no judgments. By the time that this<br />\npaper is issued,the findings of the committee will<br />\nprobably have been made known.<br />\nThe truth, and the whole truth, is what the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER and all the student body demand.<br />\nThe charges made against our representatives,<br />\nwhile by no means criminal, are, nevertheless,<br />\nsomething unheard of at Johns Hopkins, and if<br />\nfound true, will immeasurably decrease our influence in the work of promoting bona-fide student<br />\nathletics, the cause which we have been professedly championing in this city. If the accusation<br />\nbe false, this fact will be welcomed by all lovers<br />\nof true sport, and will be given all possible publicity. If it be true, let us declare it, assert the<br />\nstrongest disapproval of the student body as a<br />\nviolation of University traditions, place the<br />\nblame exactly where it belongs, and then drop<br />\nthe subject forever. But let us by no means<br />\nattempt to conceal the truth. There are in the<br />\ncity and State many persons who are ready to<br />\ncriticise us on any pretext. The eyes of these<br />\npeople and of the whole athletic element of the<br />\ncity are upon us now. We must not let these<br />\nsay that we are doing something of which we<br />\nare ashamed. If we have sinned against the<br />\nethical code, it is a matter of keen regret, but<br />\nnot a matter for discouragement.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER desires to state that this<br />\nbusiness, if it prove to be as asserted, in no way<br />\nrepresents Hopkins ideals, nor reflects Hopkins<br />\nsentiment, and while earnestly desiring the vindication of our representatives, the NEWS-LETTER feels that it will be more to the honor of<br />\nthe University to assert the plain facts without<br />\nprejudice than to attempt to suppress the slightest detail. .<br />\n611.W<br />\nIs not the NEWS-LETTER justified in drawing<br /><br />\n414<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nIf<br /><br />\nthe conclusion that much of this trouble is due<br />\nindirectly to the policy of confining our athletic<br />\nefforts outside of the Maryland Intercollegiate<br />\nAssociation exclusively to one or two colleges of<br />\nquestionable amateur status or at least, of comparative obscurity of reputation? The championship of the Association is a worthy aim;<br />\nbut asidefrom thisfact, why should there be such<br />\na senrcity of opponents as to compel us to play<br />\nth- same teams over and over again? It has<br />\nbecm shown that the finest and best known colleges in the South are ready to arrange dates<br />\nwith us at any time. Some of these teams are<br />\ntoo heavy for our men, but there are many<br />\nwhom we could meet on fair terms, and with<br />\nwhom it would be an honor to play, with no<br />\noccasion for undignified bickerings over disqualified players. We have defeated Delaware<br />\nCollege and the College of Physicians and Surgeons with comparative ease, and have gotten<br />\nall the prestige that was coming to us; are there<br />\nso few other colleges that we must risk the loss<br />\nof our advantage by meeting the same teams<br />\nagain? To defeat these two institutions was<br />\nsome honor; to be defeated by them now would<br />\nbe to lose more than we have gained. We have<br />\ngotten into difficulty and lost some standing by<br />\nour second encounter with P. and S.; let us hope<br />\nfor no further trouble this Saturday against<br />\nDelaware.<br />\nwww<br />\nIt has already been announced in this paper<br />\nthat a strong representation is desired at Annapolis on the 24th of this month, when our<br />\nteam plays St. John's College for the Maryland<br />\nIntercollegiate Championship. The championship was won last fall nearly as much through<br />\nthe efforts of the rooters as through the skill of<br />\nthe team. A victory on that stony mountain<br />\nslope at Westminster last November without<br />\nthe encouragement produced by the presence of<br />\nthose ninety or more Hopkins men on the side<br />\nlines was problematical indeed. A hundred men<br />\nshould go to Annapolis. Special rates will be<br />\nobtained, and a fine time can be had. The Chief<br />\nRooter is taking the names of all desiring to go.<br /><br />\nopinion may feel that they have shown the<br />\nproper spirit of college men at such a time.<br />\nActive participation in the campaign for the purpose of promoting what are deemed the best<br />\ninterests of the country is the privilege and duty<br />\nof every college man who feels that his studies<br />\nhave helped him to clearer understanding of the<br />\nissues involved.

He clattered his heels along the<br />\nfloor, opened the door with a push and let it<br />\nswing to with a resounding bang. The incident<br />\nwas significant not only of the slight regard<br />\nsome men have for the accepted etiquette of such<br />\npublic places, but in drawing attention to character as revealed in the little things of conduct.<br />\nThere was a self-assurance, a self appreciation,<br />\nan eloquent importance in the rattling of those<br />\nheels and the banging of that door past all<br />\nmistaking.<br />\nww<br />\nThe general desertion of Seniors from the<br />\nDean's course in Logic on Election day was interesting. Two or three men who lived up<br />\ncountry and had to go home to vote were properly entitled to the absence. Perhaps there were<br />\nothers detained by equally patriotic duties, but<br />\nit is a safe guess that a fine majority of those<br />\nwho were compelled to miss the Dean that day<br />\nhave as yet to assume the real burdens of citizenship. The excuses made to the good doctor<br />\nthe day following were doubtless luminous and<br />\nsufficient. There is no telling how far the Senior was responsible for the momentous work of<br />\nthe sixth of November. It would only be accusing him of a pardonable return to his prep.<br />\ndays to conjecture that he had to snagboxesfor<br />\nthe evening's bon-fire. Again, the A E I 0 U's<br />\nof the Dean's logical formulu may have had<br />\nmore to do with the emptying of the class chairs<br />\nthan any other \"paramount issue.\" One of<br />\nthese days some ambitious student may set<br />\nabout determining the period in an undergraduate's life when he ceases to take advantage of<br />\na fair opening for an excusable \"cut.\"<br />\nw<br />\nHopkins men take little stock in Public Aid,<br />\nCharity, and Correction if their absence from<br />\nthe first of Dr. Brackett's lectures is worth<br />\nanything in evidence. As this is the only work<br />\nin Sociology offered at the University the matter<br />\nis the more notable. While the course is well<br />\nattended by an interested public, three undergraduates and as few graduate students repre-<br /><br />\nsented the University. Aside from the technical<br />\nvalue of these lectures it is not incredible that<br />\nthey would go a long way in enriching the life<br />\nof the student himself, as a member of the great<br />\nbrotherhood, with a share in the responsibility<br />\nwe all have to shoulder in setting right some of<br />\nthis old world's social disorder. It is an old<br />\ntime cry that the student, shutting himself up<br />\nin his study shuts himself off too much from life<br />\nabout him, that he may as well be bound in<br />\nsheep, labeled Vol,. MXXIX and ranged along<br />\nthe shelf with the cobwebs. The political economists have some time since been driven outfrom<br />\ntheir oil-smelling dens, and we have in our own<br />\nDr. Hollander a stirring example of a student<br />\nwho has put up his books for a time while he<br />\nperforms a notable public service. It is a movement as prophetic as it is gratifying. With the<br />\nsame spirit, if in less degree, every student<br />\nshould contribute what he can in solving these<br />\npressing problems of every-day life. Dr. Brackett, himself a Hopkins graduate,is utterly qualified to present his subject,a man offetching personality and contagious enthusiasm. It would<br />\nbe a mighty good thing if more of our men<br />\nwould put themselves under his influence for the<br />\nremaining Tuesday afternoons.<br />\nser W<br /><br />\nTHE KENTUCKY COLONELS.<br />\n\"The Kentucky Colonels and Judges Association of the University held its regular conclave<br />\nat Gordon's, last Friday night.

Western Maryland<br />\nhad been reported unusually strong this year,<br />\nand when she succeeded in defeating Gallaudet<br />\nby the score of 16 to 5, some apprehension<br />\nwas felt on the part of the Hopkins team. In<br />\nSaturday's game, however, the Black and Blue<br />\ncompletely outplayed their opponents in every<br />\npoint. Western Maryland's punting was feeble,<br />\ntheir interference poor, their fumbles numerous,<br />\nand the team work much slower and decidedly<br />\ninferior to ours. A rainy day kept away many<br />\nwho would otherwise have come. The field was<br />\na mud puddle, and it was veritably a case of \"if<br />\nyou can't run there slide there,\" while the slippery ball made fumbles frequent.<br />\nThe Hopkins eleven unquestionably put up the<br />\nbest game it has played this year.

M. H. Rowland's scandalous charges<br />\nagainst Hopkins' foot-ball representatives appeared in the Baltimore News as an answer to<br />\nan earlier letter by Manager Booker in the same<br />\npaper. This letter of Mr. Booker's cited reasons<br />\nfor the cancellation of the Johns Hopkins-Baltimore Medical College Election day game. It is<br />\nconceded that this letter opened the scandal by<br />\ncalling forth Dr. Rowland's charge. The report<br />\nto which I object names me as the author of the<br />\nletter. It is misleading. My sole connection<br />\nwith the matter was of this rather dissenting<br />\nnature:<br />\nManager Booker brought me a letter about<br />\nten days ago which he wished to print in The<br />\nNews. The letter condemned the foot-ball organization of the Medical College, criticised the<br />\ncollege faculty,and censured the college students.<br />\nI asked Mr. Booker if Mr. Mackdermott knew<br />\nabout the letter. Mr. Booker replied that Mr.<br />\nMackdermott knew its contents and approved<br />\nits publication. Since Mr. Booker brought the<br />\nletter to me as a Hopkins man rather than a reporter, I felt justified in criticising it.<br />\nI told him at once and shortly that I disapproved it and considered it intemperate in its<br />\npartisanship and superfluous in its scope. I<br />\ntold him that if he and Mr. Mackdermott<br />\nwanted to tell the public why a game was cancelled they had best narrow their words to that<br /><br />\n(<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\none matter without wandering aside to give<br />\nneedless offence. As a man of sense Mr. Booker<br />\naccepted this as sensible advice without demur.<br />\nAn hour later he brought me a second letter.<br />\nI considered it an improvement on the first, but<br />\nthought it still contained sentences to no better<br />\npurpose than the aggravation of a dispute. He<br />\nread the letter over and agreed with me again.<br />\n\"But what is to be said then ?\" he asked.<br />\n\"If anything must be said at all,\"I answered,<br />\n\"say just why the game was cancelled and no<br />\nmore.\"<br />\nWe then went to a table and I wrote on the<br />\nbacks of the sheets of the letter what I thought<br />\nsuch a paper should contain. I gave the sheets<br />\nto Mr. Booker to use as he liked. Three or four<br />\ndays later a letter from him was received by the<br />\nSporting Editor of The News and printed.<br />\nSome sections of it were like some I had written; its other parts were quite diffk:rent from<br />\nany of mine. To Mr. Booker's credit, this final<br />\nletter was justly explanatory and less provocative of bad feeling than that which he and Mr.<br />\nMackdermott read together.<br />\nI myself never suggested or favored the printing of any letter. The letter which appeared<br />\nwas not of my writing. Concerning the wisdom<br />\nor folly of it, I won't presume to express an<br />\nopinion. If its results are beneficial there is no<br />\nblame. If its results are bad I trust that all of<br />\nus will consider carefully where lies the fault<br />\nbefore imputing it to anybody.<br />\nVery trilly yours,<br />\nZed MARSHALL BALLARD.<br />\nW W sr<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University and College of<br />\nPhysicians and Surgeons foot-ball teams occupied boxes at the Auditorium, Election night.<br />\nNo arrests were made.<br /><br />\nIt<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nHorace Gillespie, end on the 'Varsity, has<br />\nbeen elected captain of the foot-ball team of<br />\nNaughty-Two.
