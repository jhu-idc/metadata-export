Before<br />\nthe interviewing and picturesnapping were over, no less than<br />\nthree burlesque queens had<br />\nvisited the Homewood campus in<br />\nbroad<br />\ndaylight, had<br />\ncoffee<br />\namidst many stares in Levering,<br />\ntaken a few notes in a Biology<br />\nlecture, posed for pictures at<br />\nvarious points of the campus<br />\n(including the interior of a<br />\ndormitory room), and in general caused more than a mild<br />\nstir everywhere.<br />\nIt all proved one thing\u2014the<br />\nperformers themselves take burlesque stripping as a serious, and<br />\nquite lucrative, business.<br />\nSkyscraper<br />\n\"I earn between $30,000 and<br />\n$40,000 a. year, and it's strictly<br />\nbusiness,\" the most talkative of<br />\nthe three, a 6'8\" burlesque star<br />\nintones.

It is this because within its passage<br />\nlies a tacit, perhaps unrealized, but nevertheless inherent<br />\ntrust in the individual student.<br />\nIt is a well-known fact that the motto of our University implies freedom as the framework for behavior,<br />\nand certainly the basic nature of student life here is in<br />\nkeeping with this idea. However, there has of late crept<br />\ninto the unique Hopkins pattern of self-government a<br />\nsometimes oppressive reliance upon prohibitive rules to<br />\nset and govern undergraduate behavior.<br />\nThe negativistic notions which have promoted this<br />\ngrowing shift in emphasis from freedom to regulation<br />\nare a deadening blow to the way in which Hopkins has<br />\nlong prided itself for maintaining its student life.<br />\nIn permitting the dormitory student greater freedom<br />\nregarding the use of his room to entertain female guests,<br />\nthe DSRC has correctly placed the burden of restriction<br />\nnot on a set of rules but upon the students themselves.<br />\nThe plan is a positive one because it recognizes the need<br />\nfor individual responsibility regarding the use of privacy<br />\nand works on the assumption that a student shouldn't<br />\nneed tightly-drawn restrictions to govern his behavior.<br />\nThis assumption is, indeed, the only one upon which a<br />\nself-governing, free community can operate.<br />\nEven more heartening than the DSRC's move is the<br />\natmosphere of student freedom which has once again been<br />\nallowed to prevail. This atmosphere demands the appreciation of the students and must not be abused.

Light up and see for yourself...Or, if you like, don't<br />\nlight up. Just take a Marlboro, unlighted, and puff a couple of<br />\ntimes. Get that wonderful flavor? You bet you do! Even without lighting you can taste Marlboro's excellent filter blend.<br />\nAlso you can make your package last practically forever.<br />\nNo, I say, it was not the great number of Marlboro smokers<br />\nthat astounded me,it was the great number of married students.<br />\nYou may find this hard to believe but latest statistics show that<br />\nat some coeducational colleges the proportion of married undergraduates runs as high as thirty percent! And, what is even<br />\nmore startling, fully one-quarter of these marriages have been<br />\nblessed with issue!<br />\nHere now is a figure to give you pause! Not that we don't<br />\nall love babies. Of course we do! Babies are pink and fetching<br />\nrascals, given to winsome noises and droll expressions, and we<br />\nall like nothing better than to rain kisses on their soft little<br />\nskulls.

It is this because within its passage<br />\nlies a tacit, perhaps unrealized, but nevertheless inherent<br />\ntrust in the individual student.<br />\nIt is a well-known fact that the motto of our University implies freedom as the framework for behavior,<br />\nand certainly the basic nature of student life here is in<br />\nkeeping with this idea. However, there has of late crept<br />\ninto the unique Hopkins pattern of self-government a<br />\nsometimes oppressive reliance upon prohibitive rules to<br />\nset and govern undergraduate behavior.<br />\nThe negativistic notions which have promoted this<br />\ngrowing shift in emphasis from freedom to regulation<br />\nare a deadening blow to the way in which Hopkins has<br />\nlong prided itself for maintaining its student life.<br />\nIn permitting the dormitory student greater freedom<br />\nregarding the use of his room to entertain female guests,<br />\nthe DSRC has correctly placed the burden of restriction<br />\nnot on a set of rules but upon the students themselves.<br />\nThe plan is a positive one because it recognizes the need<br />\nfor individual responsibility regarding the use of privacy<br />\nand works on the assumption that a student shouldn't<br />\nneed tightly-drawn restrictions to govern his behavior.<br />\nThis assumption is, indeed, the only one upon which a<br />\nself-governing, free community can operate.<br />\nEven more heartening than the DSRC's move is the<br />\natmosphere of student freedom which has once again been<br />\nallowed to prevail. This atmosphere demands the appreciation of the students and must not be abused. Otherwise, the students themselves will shatter the dignity<br />\nwhich they have been entrusted to maintain.<br /><br />\n43 Beans?<br /><br />\nan actress.

Light up and see for yourself...Or, if you like, don't<br />\nlight up. Just take a Marlboro, unlighted, and puff a couple of<br />\ntimes. Get that wonderful flavor? You bet you do! Even without lighting you can taste Marlboro's excellent filter blend.<br />\nAlso you can make your package last practically forever.<br />\nNo, I say, it was not the great number of Marlboro smokers<br />\nthat astounded me,it was the great number of married students.<br />\nYou may find this hard to believe but latest statistics show that<br />\nat some coeducational colleges the proportion of married undergraduates runs as high as thirty percent! And, what is even<br />\nmore startling, fully one-quarter of these marriages have been<br />\nblessed with issue!<br />\nHere now is a figure to give you pause! Not that we don't<br />\nall love babies. Of course we do! Babies are pink and fetching<br />\nrascals, given to winsome noises and droll expressions, and we<br />\nall like nothing better than to rain kisses on their soft little<br />\nskulls. But just the same, to the young campus couple who are<br />\nParents for the first time the baby is likely to be a source of<br />\nconsiderable worry.
