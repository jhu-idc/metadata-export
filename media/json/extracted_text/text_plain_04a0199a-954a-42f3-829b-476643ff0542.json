Unfortunately, the record has not shown improvement in the won-andlost column. It is felt from the Jay's Nest, however, that improvement has been made in the team and that there will be a slight<br />\nimprovement in the record this year.<br />\nWe base this outlook on the showings against Franklin and<br />\nMarshall and Carnegie Tech. Last year Hopkins was trampled by<br />\nthe Diplomats but this year it took a let-down by the Jay's in the<br />\nlast six minutes to bring victory to the Pennsylvanians. In both<br />\nthe Tech and F&M games, Hopkins has definitely been hurt by the<br />\nabsence of Don Gallagher, steller center and line-backer.<br />\nThe loss of Jack Lawrence for the Tech game probably hurt<br />\nthe Jays a great deal, for because of his top performance against<br />\nF&M, he might have been the difference between those two\u2014nearmisses in the second quarter and success.<br />\nBut all this is, \"what might have been.\" The fact is that injuries are an intregal part of football and that being human, the<br />\nplayers are susceptible to ups and downs. We, therefore, might as<br />\nwell face the fact that we must allow for less than perfection when<br />\nfiguring the capabilities of a squad.<br />\nCould it be that Mr. Bridgers is a little too optimistic with his<br />\nchances? There appears to be a few too many if's in the 1955<br />\n\u2014Bain<br />\nedition, a major one being that everyone is in tip-top condition and<br />\nAction on the gridiron last Sat- urday as an unidentified CarnegieTech back rambles for six yards<br />\nbefore running into the arms of Hopkins' players Ernie Bates (11),Sam Wright (60), and Arlyn Marplaying at top efficiency.

It is felt from the Jay's Nest, however, that improvement has been made in the team and that there will be a slight<br />\nimprovement in the record this year.<br />\nWe base this outlook on the showings against Franklin and<br />\nMarshall and Carnegie Tech. Last year Hopkins was trampled by<br />\nthe Diplomats but this year it took a let-down by the Jay's in the<br />\nlast six minutes to bring victory to the Pennsylvanians. In both<br />\nthe Tech and F&amp;M games, Hopkins has definitely been hurt by the<br />\nabsence of Don Gallagher, steller center and line-backer.<br />\nThe loss of Jack Lawrence for the Tech game probably hurt<br />\nthe Jays a great deal, for because of his top performance against<br />\nF&amp;M, he might have been the difference between those two\u2014nearmisses in the second quarter and success.<br />\nBut all this is, \"what might have been.\" The fact is that injuries are an intregal part of football and that being human, the<br />\nplayers are susceptible to ups and downs. We, therefore, might as<br />\nwell face the fact that we must allow for less than perfection when<br />\nfiguring the capabilities of a squad.<br />\nCould it be that Mr. Bridgers is a little too optimistic with his<br />\nchances? There appears to be a few too many if's in the 1955<br />\n\u2014Bain<br />\nedition, a major one being that everyone is in tip-top condition and<br />\nAction on the gridiron last Sat- urday as an unidentified CarnegieTech back rambles for six yards<br />\nbefore running into the arms of Hopkins' players Ernie Bates (11),Sam Wright (60), and Arlyn Marplaying at top efficiency.
