The first few weeks of<br />\ndrill must inevitably be devoted to<br />\npractice in rudimentary formations<br />\nand to setting-up exercises, and<br />\nMr. Kistler has amply demonstrated<br />\nhis proficiency in instruction -along<br />\nthese lines to o long succession of<br />\nfreshman classes.<br />\n- It is planned to form two squads<br />\nof the men this spring, one to drill<br />\nin the cage, and the other, composed chiefly of the engineering<br />\nstudents, to drill at Homewood.<br />\nThese arrangements are, of course,<br />\nonly temporary.

The first matter brought up after the meeting<br />\nhad been called to order by President Tingley was the re-enacting of<br />\nthe hazing scenes of 1914. A debate arose as to whether it was<br />\nmore advisable to use the old pictures taken at the time of the hazing or to use the new pictures which<br />\nwere taken last Saturday at Homewood. The matter was finally left<br />\nto the committee which has charge<br />\nof the re-enacting, of which L.

Hooper, '18.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MARCH 27, 1916.<br />\n<br />\nManaging Editor for this number, Reuben Oppenheimer, '18.<br />\nThe Installation of Military Training.<br />\n<br />\nMilitary training has come; Hopkins has definitely taken its stand<br />\nas favoring the nation-wide movement for preparedness and for the<br />\ndevelopment of the college men of<br />\nthe country which that movement<br />\nbears with it. It has been a momentous decision; how momentous,<br />\nit may be left for future generations to realize. For us, the present students, only one realization<br />\nis possible; we have volunteered<br />\nin full consciousness of the meaning of the act to train ourselves<br />\nfor actual service beneath our country's flag.<br />\nThere is no honor and no avail<br />\nin attempting to blind ourselves to<br />\nthe full significance of the Course<br />\nwhose installation . this week has<br />\nwitnessed. Those of us who, next<br />\nyear, take the full course offered<br />\nunder the act by which the course<br />\nhas been inaugurated, will place<br />\nourselves under jurisdiction of the<br />\nUnited States Department of War,<br />\nand if Avar ever comes, we shall be<br />\nconsidered among the first reserve<br />\nforces of the nation.<br />\nThe course in military training<br />\nhas been installed at Hopkins for<br />\ntwo reasons. The first is for the<br />\nactual- training which it gives, for<br />\nthe benefit to muscle and mind<br />\nwhich only the rigor or drill can<br />\nimpart. That such benefit Cioes accrue is undeniable. There is no better development of the body obtain-<br />\n<br />\nable than that furnished by, the<br />\nUnited States Army. And the discipline of command, the co-ordination of individuals and the submission of the part to the whole in one<br />\nunited movement is a lesson which<br />\nno other organization existent can<br />\nbetter teach.<br />\nBut the real cause of the installation of the course goes back to a<br />\nfar higher motive than any thought<br />\nof personal development. Americans are accused, perhaps justly, of<br />\na suppression of emotion, and<br />\nagainst our colleges especially is<br />\nthis accusation aimed-we are<br />\ncharged with a distaste for the<br />\nrecognition of any feeling which<br />\nhas a root deeper than the trivial<br />\nand superficial. That the implication is in some sense just is proved<br />\nby the hesitancy with \"which we<br />\nproclaim, our true motive in welcoming. this course by the almost<br />\nbashful haste with which we are<br />\nalready prone to take it as a matter<br />\nof course. Yet the gravity of our<br />\nact over-rides all traditions-we<br />\nmust acknowledge and acknowledge triumphantly the real motive<br />\nof our decision. Hopkins is welcoming military training because<br />\nof one paramount desire-it wishes<br />\nto serve and -to protect its country.<br />\nBrickley's Resignation.<br />\n<br />\nThe entire University experienced a genuine and profound sense<br />\nof regret when announcement was<br />\nmade that Chas. Brickley would not<br />\ncoach the Hopkins eleven this fall.<br />\nThat regret was partly for the setback which Brickley's resignation<br />\nhas given to Hopkins' football<br />\nplans; but, even more, it was a<br />\nsense of sincere disappointment for<br />\nthe loss of the man himself.<br />\nBrickley came to Hopkins last<br />\nyear at a time when our football<br />\nProspects were perhaps darker than.<br />\nthey have been at any time since the<br />\nUniversity's foundation; he faced<br />\nobstacles which, to many men,<br />\nwould have seemed insurmountable.<br />\nYet, with a squad of men almost ludicrously small in proportion to the<br />\nsquads of larger institutions, with<br />\ntime for practice greatly restricted,<br />\nand with the entire absence of that<br />\ndormitory life which is so essential<br />\nto the development of a team, he<br />\nsucceeded in turning out an eleven<br />\nwhich won the championship of the<br />\nState, and which showed in every<br />\ngame it played a vigor and spirit<br />\nand dash of which any college could<br />\nwell afford to he proud.<br />\nHopkins was already counting itself fortunate in securing Brickley's<br />\nservices for the coaching of next<br />\nyear's team, when the Athletic Association made its announcement.<br />\nYet, however much the University<br />\nmay have counted - on his work,<br />\nhowever great may have been the<br />\nholies of what another year under<br />\nhis guidance might be able to produce, however much the plans of<br />\nthe Association may have been disorganized, there is no reason and<br />\nno excuse for believing that the<br />\nprogress of the football team itself<br />\nhas been in any way stopped..Work<br />\n<br />\nsuch as Brickley performed last fait<br />\ncannot go for naught; he himself<br />\nmay not be able to Coach the eleven<br />\nnext season, but the spirit and the<br />\ndetermination which he instilled<br />\ninto every member of last season's<br />\nsquad will make itself felt again.<br />\nHopkins has awakened, and , although it deplores the absence Of<br />\nthe man who awakened it, it has<br />\ntoo much confidence, both in the<br />\ncaliber of its players and in the<br />\njudgment of those controlling its<br />\nfootball destinies, to fear that the<br />\nshowing made by the team last year<br />\nWill prove to be anything but a beginning.<br />\nHopkins appreciates the work,<br />\nCharles Brickley has done far too<br />\nmuch to wish that he should follow<br />\nany course which would interfere<br />\nin any way with his future prospects; and although his offer before the Athletic Board was in accord with the fine courtesy and<br />\nsportsmanship which he has always shown, the entire student<br />\nbody agrees, as a matter of course,<br />\nwith the instantaneous decision of<br />\nthe Board, not to hold him to the<br />\nletter of his agreement. It was desired, above all things, that Brickley<br />\ncould find it convenient to return<br />\nhere next year. That desire has<br />\nproved to be incapable of fulfilment,<br />\nand so all the appreciation which<br />\nevery student feels for what he has<br />\ndone, all the admiration and respect and friendship which, within<br />\nthe short space of four months, he<br />\nsucceeded in arousing among us,<br />\nmust go into a sincere and universal wish that this future life will<br />\nbe attended by all the success of<br />\nwhich he has shown himself worthy<br />\nat this University.<br />\nIn Foreign Lands.<br />\n<br />\nOccasionally, to both Hopkins<br />\nmen, somewhat blinded by familiarity, and to the nation, somewhat<br />\nprone to indifference to collegiate<br />\nreputation, there comes a striking<br />\nconfirmation of all the high scholarship and intellectual attainment for<br />\nwhich Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhas always stood. Such a confirmation is the untold action of the<br />\nChinese Government in calling Dr.<br />\nWilloughby to China and in asking<br />\nPresident Goodnow to retain the<br />\npost of constitutional advisor.<br />\nThe honor is paid primarily to<br />\nthe men called upon to occupy these<br />\npositions, but in recognition of the<br />\nabilities of these men the Chinese<br />\nGovernment is also recognizing the<br />\nworth of Hopkins standards and<br />\nthe reputation which this University everywhere enjoys. It is an<br />\nhonor which comes but once in a<br />\ngeneration, and which is all the<br />\nmore meaningful in that it is paid<br />\nby a nation which. is but beginning<br />\nto realize itself and which needs<br />\ncounsel at this petiod more than it<br />\never has ill the entire course of its<br />\nhistory.<br />\n<br />\nThe most cordial relationship has<br />\nalways existed between Hopkins<br />\nand the men at the head of Chinese<br />\nscholarship and progress. China<br />\nlooks to this institution perhaps as<br />\n<br />\nmuch as to any other in this country for the furtherance of that interchange of ideals which is essential to the thorough understanding<br />\nof one country by another. Th(<br />\npositions of President Goodnow<br />\nand Dr. Willoughby are significant<br />\nnot only for the recognition whiclthey pay to this University's attainments, but for the promise ol<br />\nfriendly and mutual developmetv<br />\nwhich they bear to both China anc<br />\nthe United States and to the world<br />\n<br />\n\u201e<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\nMonday, March 27<br />\n5.00 P.

The<br />\nfirst Board was organized with the<br />\nprimary purpose of setting up satisfactory rules to govern \"rushing\". This is the year 1916, and<br />\nthe heir of those earlier days is still<br />\nsetting up rules to govern rushing.<br />\nSurely by this time the stress of<br />\norganizing need no longer claim its<br />\nattention. And could one dare suggest that a Board chosen from the<br />\nbest that the Fraternities have to<br />\noffer, either does not care enough<br />\nor has not vision enough to confront and seek as an inter-fraternity body a solution for other and<br />\nmore intimate problems of fraternity life?<br />\nIt is the fond desire of those who<br />\nhave once served on boards or<br />\ncouncils to gracefully and gratefully pass the toga to others, and<br />\nthen to slip out to be one of that<br />\n\"silent succession\" that has already<br />\ngone on. That, some consider, is<br />\nthe height of wisdom. First, it<br />\nsaves trouble. And then, too, none<br />\ncall remark that trite but everforceful: \"Why don't you mind<br />\nyour own business ?\"<br />\nI beg for this day to be one<br />\napart from that \"silent succession,\"<br />\nand to boldly ask why fraternity<br />\nmen at Hopkins, as a body, have<br />\nnever considered, for instance, the<br />\nquestion of Fraternity Scholarship.<br />\nLo, and we see an excited gentleman in the far corner arise and<br />\nexclaim without taking breath:(1)<br />\n\"We maintain our scholarship<br />\nthrough committees working within the separate fraternities.\" (2)<br />\n\"How could we improve on that?\"<br />\n(3) \"Anyway, that's not the InterFraternity Board's business.\"<br />\nThe excited gentleman, of course,<br />\ndemands an answer. Suppose we<br />\nsay to( )that the spur to scholarship under a committee plan in the<br />\nseparate fraternity is, as a rule, only<br />\nas vivid as the personality of the<br />\nchairman of the committee, and<br />\nconsequently the stimulation of<br />\nscholarship will fluctuate violently<br />\n\u2014and often, lamentably. (3) You<br />\nsay that is not the business of the<br />\nInter-Fraternity Board :- Do you<br />\nTo the Editor of<br />\n<br />\nSENIORS, SOPHS AND FRESHIES<br />\nPREPARE FOR BANQUETS<br />\n<br />\nThe committees of all the<br />\nclasses except the Junior, whose<br />\nbanquet was held last Monday<br />\nnight at the Rennert Hotel, are<br />\nbusy planning the respective class<br />\nbanquets in order that they may<br />\nbe held before the Easter holidays.<br />\nThe Senior Class has put its<br />\nbanquet in charge of a committee<br />\ncomposed of McDowell, chairman; M. E. Bagley, Vickers and<br />\nLudington. These men are planning to hold their banquet very<br />\nshortly, but no definite plans have<br />\nyet been made.<br />\nThe Sophomore committee, consisting of Henry Evans, chairman; Sutton, Edgerton, Hoffman,<br />\nand Duncan, are planning a new<br />\nfeature which is to be a surprise<br />\nto everyone, and which they refuse to disclose in any way. At<br />\npresent the committee intends to<br />\nhold the banquet on April 4, at<br />\nthe Hotel Rennert; the price<br />\nbeing $2.00 a plate. Alex. Wolf,<br />\nthe president of the Sophomore<br />\nclass, will act as toastmaster, and<br />\na number of speeches will be made<br />\nby members of the class.<br />\nThe committee in charge of the<br />\nFreshman banquet, made up of<br />\nHarris Kirk, chairman; Haskell,<br />\nCarroll, Lentz, Baxley and W.<br />\nStokes, has been at work on the<br />\nvarious features of the occasion,<br />\nbut has not decided definitely on<br />\nthe date or the place. It is most<br />\nlikely that the banquet will be<br />\nheld sometime after the Sophomore banquet, ill accordance with<br />\nthe Hopkins tradition. Harris E.<br />\nKirke will act as the Freshman<br />\ntoastmaster. ,The price of the<br />\nbanquet will be $2.00 a plate.<br />\nknow that some people choose for<br />\ntheir pet argument that members<br />\nof college societies stand lower in<br />\ntheir studies than non-members?<br />\nWe think that untrue, but why not<br />\nprove that the fraternities are ambitious for scholarship? Why not<br />\nconvince the skeptic instead of<br />\nfruitlessly arguing with him; and,<br />\nto devise regular, universal and effective means to uphold fraternity<br />\nscholarship, who can better take the<br />\ninitiative than the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nBoard? Besides, why should not<br />\nthe 1916 Board be a little original?<br />\nThe excited gentleman arises<br />\nagain to remark: \"Aha, you took<br />\npains to skip (2).\"<br />\n\"I certainly \u00e7id, Sir, hoping that<br />\nbefore the next issue of THE NEWSLETTER you might be interested sufficiently to work out the matter to<br />\nyour own satisfaction, remembering that any plan for betterment of<br />\ninter-fraternity scholarship needs<br />\nbe generally agreeable, automatic,<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\nand fed and sustained by praiseworthy rivalry.\"<br />\nThey say that the next NEWSLETTER comes out in a week; meanwhile, think it over, gentlemen.<br />\nYours,<br />\nX.<br />\nMarch 24, 1916.<br />\n<br />\nIndignant Customer \u2014 Barber,<br />\nwhy did you drop that steaming<br />\ntowel on my face?<br />\nBarber\u2014Because it was too hot<br />\nto hold, sir.\u2014Ex.<br />\nIndignant Professor\u2014\"Quit this<br />\nquibbling, sir.

On the Saturday following<br />\nthe Alumni game Hopkins meets<br />\nCornell. It will be recalled that<br />\nthe game. with Cornell last year<br />\nhad to be cancelled, owing to a<br />\nsnowstorm. After Cornell, the<br />\n'Varsity plays Penn State on<br />\nApril 15th; then Navy on Wednesday, April 19th, at Annapolis;<br />\nPennsylvania on Saturday, the<br />\n22nd, at Homewood, and Stevens<br />\non the 29th. The team will journey to South Bethlehem to play<br />\nLehigh on May 6th. As Lehigh<br />\nhas proved to be an uncertain<br />\nproposition for the Hopkins<br />\ntwelve .during the past few years,<br />\nthis is regarded as the hardest<br />\ngame on the schedule. The last<br />\ngame of the season will be played<br />\nat Homewood on May 13th, when<br />\nHopkins meets Swarthmore.<br />\nHopkins is not scheduled to<br />\nplay Carlisle or Harvard this season, but instead meets Penn State<br />\nand Stevens. Carlisle has dropped<br />\nall forms of athletics, while conflicting dates prevented Hopkins<br />\nand Harvard from meeting this<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe squad held their first practice out of doors about a week<br />\nago. Up to this time all the practices have been held in the cage.<br />\nFor the present, the squad is compelled to use the old Country.<br />\nSchool field until Homewood and<br />\nStraus fields are in proper condition. It is only a matter of a day<br />\nor so, however, until the players<br />\nwill have the Gilman field for the<br />\nregular grounds at Homewood.<br />\nA number of Alumni have lately joined the squad in order to get<br />\nin trim for the game scheduled for<br />\nthis Saturday, and if the results of<br />\nprevious years are to be depended<br />\nupon, the contest is sure to be<br />\nvery closely contested. Coach Raney Wolfe, Assistant Coaches<br />\nTom Troxell and John Huck, Eddie Hulbert, the Schmeisser brothers and many other former, stars<br />\nwill be in the lineup for the<br />\nAlumni.<br />\nWith the first game less than<br />\none week off, the regular members<br />\nof the squad are engaged in the<br />\nhardest work of the season.

Liebensperger, Baker, Brooks, Hoffman and<br /><br />\nA meeting of the Senior Class<br />\nwas held last Wednesday, March<br />\n22, at which various class matters<br />\nwere discussed and several committees were appointed. The first matter brought up after the meeting<br />\nhad been called to order by President Tingley was the re-enacting of<br />\nthe hazing scenes of 1914. A debate arose as to whether it was<br />\nmore advisable to use the old pictures taken at the time of the hazing or to use the new pictures which<br />\nwere taken last Saturday at Homewood. The matter was finally left<br />\nto the committee which has charge<br />\nof the re-enacting, of which L. R.<br />\nVickers, the class photographer, is<br />\nchairman.<br />\nThe question of the Senior banquet was not brought up. President<br />\nTingley appointed the following<br />\ncommittee: McDowell, chaiernan ;<br />\n\\Tickers, Ludington and Bagley. It<br />\nwas then determined to have the<br />\nbanquet some time before the Easter holidays.<br />\nThe other committees which were<br />\nappointed to take charge of the<br />\ncoming spring events of the Senior<br />\nclass were the Class Day, Senior<br />\nProm and Senior \"Party\" Committees. The Class Day Committee is<br />\ncomposed of Frick, chairman; Hall<br />\nand Primrose; the Senior Prom<br />\nCommittee is made up of Myron C.<br />\nBagley, chairman; Woodward,<br />\nHardy and Beck, and the Senior<br />\n\"Party\" Committee consists of<br />\nVickers, chairman; Leitheiser,<br />\nTingley and Knipp.<br /><br />\nTIM NEWS-LETTER sales-check<br />\ncontest ended on Saturday, March<br />\n18, with Mr. Allan K.

The first prize will be<br />\na $6 Gillette safety razor; the others have not yet been announced.<br />\nWhile the total of checks turned<br />\nin for this contest was not so high<br />\nas that of the contest held last year,<br />\nthe business management of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER feels that it has<br />\nevery reason to be satisfied with its<br />\nresults. The more successful contest of last year was the second<br />\none of the season, and, in addition,<br />\nthe time of students who might<br />\notherwise have taken part in the<br />\nrecent competition was ocCupied<br />\nwith examinations.<br />\nFor these reasons, it has been<br />\ndecided to hold another contest<br />\nlater in the year.

Hooper, '18.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MARCH 27, 1916.<br /><br />\nManaging Editor for this number, Reuben Oppenheimer, '18.<br />\nThe Installation of Military Training.<br /><br />\nMilitary training has come; Hopkins has definitely taken its stand<br />\nas favoring the nation-wide movement for preparedness and for the<br />\ndevelopment of the college men of<br />\nthe country which that movement<br />\nbears with it. It has been a momentous decision; how momentous,<br />\nit may be left for future generations to realize. For us, the present students, only one realization<br />\nis possible; we have volunteered<br />\nin full consciousness of the meaning of the act to train ourselves<br />\nfor actual service beneath our country's flag.<br />\nThere is no honor and no avail<br />\nin attempting to blind ourselves to<br />\nthe full significance of the Course<br />\nwhose installation . this week has<br />\nwitnessed. Those of us who, next<br />\nyear, take the full course offered<br />\nunder the act by which the course<br />\nhas been inaugurated, will place<br />\nourselves under jurisdiction of the<br />\nUnited States Department of War,<br />\nand if Avar ever comes, we shall be<br />\nconsidered among the first reserve<br />\nforces of the nation.<br />\nThe course in military training<br />\nhas been installed at Hopkins for<br />\ntwo reasons. The first is for the<br />\nactual- training which it gives, for<br />\nthe benefit to muscle and mind<br />\nwhich only the rigor or drill can<br />\nimpart. That such benefit Cioes accrue is undeniable. There is no better development of the body obtain-<br /><br />\nable than that furnished by, the<br />\nUnited States Army. And the discipline of command, the co-ordination of individuals and the submission of the part to the whole in one<br />\nunited movement is a lesson which<br />\nno other organization existent can<br />\nbetter teach.<br />\nBut the real cause of the installation of the course goes back to a<br />\nfar higher motive than any thought<br />\nof personal development. Americans are accused, perhaps justly, of<br />\na suppression of emotion, and<br />\nagainst our colleges especially is<br />\nthis accusation aimed-we are<br />\ncharged with a distaste for the<br />\nrecognition of any feeling which<br />\nhas a root deeper than the trivial<br />\nand superficial. That the implication is in some sense just is proved<br />\nby the hesitancy with \"which we<br />\nproclaim, our true motive in welcoming. this course by the almost<br />\nbashful haste with which we are<br />\nalready prone to take it as a matter<br />\nof course. Yet the gravity of our<br />\nact over-rides all traditions-we<br />\nmust acknowledge and acknowledge triumphantly the real motive<br />\nof our decision. Hopkins is welcoming military training because<br />\nof one paramount desire-it wishes<br />\nto serve and -to protect its country.<br />\nBrickley's Resignation.<br /><br />\nThe entire University experienced a genuine and profound sense<br />\nof regret when announcement was<br />\nmade that Chas. Brickley would not<br />\ncoach the Hopkins eleven this fall.<br />\nThat regret was partly for the setback which Brickley's resignation<br />\nhas given to Hopkins' football<br />\nplans; but, even more, it was a<br />\nsense of sincere disappointment for<br />\nthe loss of the man himself.<br />\nBrickley came to Hopkins last<br />\nyear at a time when our football<br />\nProspects were perhaps darker than.<br />\nthey have been at any time since the<br />\nUniversity's foundation; he faced<br />\nobstacles which, to many men,<br />\nwould have seemed insurmountable.<br />\nYet, with a squad of men almost ludicrously small in proportion to the<br />\nsquads of larger institutions, with<br />\ntime for practice greatly restricted,<br />\nand with the entire absence of that<br />\ndormitory life which is so essential<br />\nto the development of a team, he<br />\nsucceeded in turning out an eleven<br />\nwhich won the championship of the<br />\nState, and which showed in every<br />\ngame it played a vigor and spirit<br />\nand dash of which any college could<br />\nwell afford to he proud.<br />\nHopkins was already counting itself fortunate in securing Brickley's<br />\nservices for the coaching of next<br />\nyear's team, when the Athletic Association made its announcement.<br />\nYet, however much the University<br />\nmay have counted - on his work,<br />\nhowever great may have been the<br />\nholies of what another year under<br />\nhis guidance might be able to produce, however much the plans of<br />\nthe Association may have been disorganized, there is no reason and<br />\nno excuse for believing that the<br />\nprogress of the football team itself<br />\nhas been in any way stopped..Work<br /><br />\nsuch as Brickley performed last fait<br />\ncannot go for naught; he himself<br />\nmay not be able to Coach the eleven<br />\nnext season, but the spirit and the<br />\ndetermination which he instilled<br />\ninto every member of last season's<br />\nsquad will make itself felt again.<br />\nHopkins has awakened, and , although it deplores the absence Of<br />\nthe man who awakened it, it has<br />\ntoo much confidence, both in the<br />\ncaliber of its players and in the<br />\njudgment of those controlling its<br />\nfootball destinies, to fear that the<br />\nshowing made by the team last year<br />\nWill prove to be anything but a beginning.<br />\nHopkins appreciates the work,<br />\nCharles Brickley has done far too<br />\nmuch to wish that he should follow<br />\nany course which would interfere<br />\nin any way with his future prospects; and although his offer before the Athletic Board was in accord with the fine courtesy and<br />\nsportsmanship which he has always shown, the entire student<br />\nbody agrees, as a matter of course,<br />\nwith the instantaneous decision of<br />\nthe Board, not to hold him to the<br />\nletter of his agreement. It was desired, above all things, that Brickley<br />\ncould find it convenient to return<br />\nhere next year. That desire has<br />\nproved to be incapable of fulfilment,<br />\nand so all the appreciation which<br />\nevery student feels for what he has<br />\ndone, all the admiration and respect and friendship which, within<br />\nthe short space of four months, he<br />\nsucceeded in arousing among us,<br />\nmust go into a sincere and universal wish that this future life will<br />\nbe attended by all the success of<br />\nwhich he has shown himself worthy<br />\nat this University.<br />\nIn Foreign Lands.<br /><br />\nOccasionally, to both Hopkins<br />\nmen, somewhat blinded by familiarity, and to the nation, somewhat<br />\nprone to indifference to collegiate<br />\nreputation, there comes a striking<br />\nconfirmation of all the high scholarship and intellectual attainment for<br />\nwhich Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhas always stood. Such a confirmation is the untold action of the<br />\nChinese Government in calling Dr.<br />\nWilloughby to China and in asking<br />\nPresident Goodnow to retain the<br />\npost of constitutional advisor.<br />\nThe honor is paid primarily to<br />\nthe men called upon to occupy these<br />\npositions, but in recognition of the<br />\nabilities of these men the Chinese<br />\nGovernment is also recognizing the<br />\nworth of Hopkins standards and<br />\nthe reputation which this University everywhere enjoys.

These men are now on<br />\ntheir way to Berlin, where they will<br />\nreport to the American Red Cross<br />\nheadquarters at the American Embassy.<br />\nThe English Government, after<br />\nreceiving many reports concerning<br />\nthe harsh treatment of German<br />\nprisdners, requested the State Department of this country to name<br />\ntwo surgeons to visit the British<br />\nprison camps in Germany. Before<br />\nany doctors could be sent, it was<br />\nnecessary to obtain permission from<br />\nthe German Imperial Government<br />\nfor these men to visit the camps.<br />\nThe German military authorities, it<br />\nis said, however, welcomed an opportunity to have the prisons inspected by impartial observers; and<br />\nso readily granted the request.<br />\nDoctors Irwin and Webster will,<br />\ntherefore, have access to all the immense prison camps, where thousands of British, French and Belgium prisoners are confined.<br />\nThe Bal'imoreans will devote<br />\nmost of their time to the British<br />\ncamps and their reports will be<br />\nmade to London.

The<br />\nfirst Board was organized with the<br />\nprimary purpose of setting up satisfactory rules to govern \"rushing\". This is the year 1916, and<br />\nthe heir of those earlier days is still<br />\nsetting up rules to govern rushing.<br />\nSurely by this time the stress of<br />\norganizing need no longer claim its<br />\nattention. And could one dare suggest that a Board chosen from the<br />\nbest that the Fraternities have to<br />\noffer, either does not care enough<br />\nor has not vision enough to confront and seek as an inter-fraternity body a solution for other and<br />\nmore intimate problems of fraternity life?<br />\nIt is the fond desire of those who<br />\nhave once served on boards or<br />\ncouncils to gracefully and gratefully pass the toga to others, and<br />\nthen to slip out to be one of that<br />\n\"silent succession\" that has already<br />\ngone on. That, some consider, is<br />\nthe height of wisdom. First, it<br />\nsaves trouble. And then, too, none<br />\ncall remark that trite but everforceful: \"Why don't you mind<br />\nyour own business ?\"<br />\nI beg for this day to be one<br />\napart from that \"silent succession,\"<br />\nand to boldly ask why fraternity<br />\nmen at Hopkins, as a body, have<br />\nnever considered, for instance, the<br />\nquestion of Fraternity Scholarship.<br />\nLo, and we see an excited gentleman in the far corner arise and<br />\nexclaim without taking breath:(1)<br />\n\"We maintain our scholarship<br />\nthrough committees working within the separate fraternities.\" (2)<br />\n\"How could we improve on that?\"<br />\n(3) \"Anyway, that's not the InterFraternity Board's business.\"<br />\nThe excited gentleman, of course,<br />\ndemands an answer. Suppose we<br />\nsay to( )that the spur to scholarship under a committee plan in the<br />\nseparate fraternity is, as a rule, only<br />\nas vivid as the personality of the<br />\nchairman of the committee, and<br />\nconsequently the stimulation of<br />\nscholarship will fluctuate violently<br />\n\u2014and often, lamentably. (3) You<br />\nsay that is not the business of the<br />\nInter-Fraternity Board :- Do you<br />\nTo the Editor of<br /><br />\nSENIORS, SOPHS AND FRESHIES<br />\nPREPARE FOR BANQUETS<br /><br />\nThe committees of all the<br />\nclasses except the Junior, whose<br />\nbanquet was held last Monday<br />\nnight at the Rennert Hotel, are<br />\nbusy planning the respective class<br />\nbanquets in order that they may<br />\nbe held before the Easter holidays.<br />\nThe Senior Class has put its<br />\nbanquet in charge of a committee<br />\ncomposed of McDowell, chairman; M. E. Bagley, Vickers and<br />\nLudington. These men are planning to hold their banquet very<br />\nshortly, but no definite plans have<br />\nyet been made.<br />\nThe Sophomore committee, consisting of Henry Evans, chairman; Sutton, Edgerton, Hoffman,<br />\nand Duncan, are planning a new<br />\nfeature which is to be a surprise<br />\nto everyone, and which they refuse to disclose in any way. At<br />\npresent the committee intends to<br />\nhold the banquet on April 4, at<br />\nthe Hotel Rennert; the price<br />\nbeing $2.00 a plate. Alex. Wolf,<br />\nthe president of the Sophomore<br />\nclass, will act as toastmaster, and<br />\na number of speeches will be made<br />\nby members of the class.<br />\nThe committee in charge of the<br />\nFreshman banquet, made up of<br />\nHarris Kirk, chairman; Haskell,<br />\nCarroll, Lentz, Baxley and W.<br />\nStokes, has been at work on the<br />\nvarious features of the occasion,<br />\nbut has not decided definitely on<br />\nthe date or the place. It is most<br />\nlikely that the banquet will be<br />\nheld sometime after the Sophomore banquet, ill accordance with<br />\nthe Hopkins tradition. Harris E.<br />\nKirke will act as the Freshman<br />\ntoastmaster. ,The price of the<br />\nbanquet will be $2.00 a plate.<br />\nknow that some people choose for<br />\ntheir pet argument that members<br />\nof college societies stand lower in<br />\ntheir studies than non-members?<br />\nWe think that untrue, but why not<br />\nprove that the fraternities are ambitious for scholarship? Why not<br />\nconvince the skeptic instead of<br />\nfruitlessly arguing with him; and,<br />\nto devise regular, universal and effective means to uphold fraternity<br />\nscholarship, who can better take the<br />\ninitiative than the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nBoard? Besides, why should not<br />\nthe 1916 Board be a little original?<br />\nThe excited gentleman arises<br />\nagain to remark: \"Aha, you took<br />\npains to skip (2).\"<br />\n\"I certainly \u00e7id, Sir, hoping that<br />\nbefore the next issue of THE NEWSLETTER you might be interested sufficiently to work out the matter to<br />\nyour own satisfaction, remembering that any plan for betterment of<br />\ninter-fraternity scholarship needs<br />\nbe generally agreeable, automatic,<br /><br />\n9<br />\nand fed and sustained by praiseworthy rivalry.\"<br />\nThey say that the next NEWSLETTER comes out in a week; meanwhile, think it over, gentlemen.<br />\nYours,<br />\nX.<br />\nMarch 24, 1916.<br /><br />\nIndignant Customer \u2014 Barber,<br />\nwhy did you drop that steaming<br />\ntowel on my face?<br />\nBarber\u2014Because it was too hot<br />\nto hold, sir.\u2014Ex.<br />\nIndignant Professor\u2014\"Quit this<br />\nquibbling, sir.
