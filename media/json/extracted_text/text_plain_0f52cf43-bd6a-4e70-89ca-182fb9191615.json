School of Medicine,<br />\nspoke on \"A Western View of<br />\nAcupuncture\" in the Garrett<br />\nRoom of the MSE Library at this<br />\nweek's Wednesday Noon Series.<br />\nSpeaking before an _audience<br />\nof approximately 50 people,<br />\nBenson outlined a brief history<br />\nof acupuncture, desCribed its<br />\ntechniques and uses, and<br />\nexpressed his own attitudes on<br />\nthis subject, one which is<br />\nbecoming increasingly<br />\ncontroversial in medical circles.<br />\nAccording to Benson,<br />\nacupuncture originated in China<br />\nabout seven \u2022thousand years ago,<br />\nalthough the exact location and<br />\ndate are unknown. \"The Chinese<br />\nphilosophy of religion and life<br />\nhas a lot to do with<br />\nacupuncture,\" stated Benson.<br />\n\"They look at man as a<br />\nmicrocosmic image of the<br />\nuniverse and subject to identical<br />\n<br />\nuniversal laws,\"<br />\nAccording to Benson, Taoism<br />\nplayed an important part for the<br />\nChinese in formulating their<br />\ntheories about acupuncture.<br />\n\"Taoism used a dual force to<br />\nexplain many of nature's ways,<br />\nespecially changes and<br />\ndifferences,\" he explained.<br />\n\"These dual forces are the Yin<br />\narid the Yang.\"<br />\nThere are well over 1000 such<br />\nacupuncture points on the body.<br />\nThe knowledge as to which<br />\npoints when treated would lead<br />\nto successful results is, according<br />\nto Benson, \"based on the<br />\nempiricism of seven thousand<br />\nyears.\"<br />\n\"The Chinese arrived at the<br />\nvarious points that would relieve<br />\npain through what was basically a<br />\nhit and miss process. If some did<br />\nnot work, they tried others.\"<br />\nBenson expressed some<br />\nskepticism about the actual value<br />\nof acupuncture and believes that<br />\nfurther neurophysiological<br />\nresearch is necessary to place it in<br />\n<br />\nperspective. His belief that<br />\nacupuncture treatment may be<br />\nhelpful to atleast some patients<br />\nfor psychological reasons was<br />\nevident when he stated that<br />\n\"acupuncture can change your<br />\nperception of pain.\"<br />\nAnother problem with<br />\nacupuncture Benson contended,<br />\nis that many of its positive results<br />\nare based on data from<br />\nacupuncture patients who report<br />\na lessening in the degree of pain<br />\nor in the degree to which they<br />\nare affected. \"Since we have no<br />\nway of measuring the severity of<br />\npain and have to rely on what<br />\npatients tell us,\" he remarked,<br />\n\"almost all the results of the<br />\neffectiveness of acupuncture are<br />\nhighly subjective.\"<br />\nAs to why acupuncture has<br />\ngained acceptance in the United<br />\nStates so quickly, Benson<br />\nsuggested, \"the general<br />\ndisenchantment of-many people<br />\nwith the current American<br />\nmedical performance.\"<br />\nHe further elaborated, \"the<br />\n<br />\nundergrauate student body<br />\nturned out to vote in the<br />\nSymposium referendum, which<br />\nwas held as a result of a change in<br />\nthe process of selecting topics for<br />\nthe annual fall event. In previous<br />\nyears, the topic was selected by<br />\nthe Student Council selections<br />\ncommittee and then ratified by<br />\nthe full S.C. This year, for the<br />\nfirst time, the selections<br />\ncommittee picked three topics to<br />\nsubmit to a student vote for the<br />\nfinal choice.<br />\n<br />\npersonal contact which derives<br />\nfrom the one to one relationship<br />\nbetween the doctor and patient<br />\ninvolved in acupuncture, results<br />\nin the patient really believing<br />\nthat the doctor cares about him.<br />\nThus, the patient often feels<br />\nobligated to experience relief and<br />\nstrongly desires to do so.\"<br />\nAnother cause of<br />\nacupuncture's acceptance,<br />\naccording to Benson, is the<br />\n\"American penchant for<br />\naccepting new things at face<br />\nvalue. Just look at how fast<br />\npeople go out and buy anything<br />\nthey see advertised on<br />\ntelevision.\"<br />\nIn closing, Benson admitted<br />\nthat despite its possible<br />\ndrawbacks, acupuncture has<br />\nproved successful in many<br />\ninstances. He strongly<br />\nemphasized, however, that<br />\n\"although it has sometimes been<br />\neffective, it is by no means a<br />\npanacea. \"Rather, it is but one<br />\npossible means of treating a<br />\npatient.\"<br />\n<br />\nnation's capital. \"The press has<br />\nbecome preoccupied with the<br />\nform and not the substance of<br />\ngovernment,\" he explained.<br />\n\"What we need is a new press less<br />\ncynical about the problems of<br />\ngovernment,\" he added.<br />\niloobthTiso<br />\nHe blamed<br />\n\u00b0pbroblem in<br />\npart on television which he said,<br />\n\"tempts the President to prefer<br />\nform rather than substance.\"<br />\nCater stressed the need for<br />\nmore openness on the part of<br />\nPresidents and the<br />\nre-establishment of the<br />\npresidential press conference on a<br />\nregular basis as ways to bolster<br />\nthe credibility of the presidency.<br />\n\"In the post-Watergate<br />\nmorality, what we need will be<br />\nmore candid, less arrogant<br />\nPresidents,\" he said. \"But we will<br />\nalso need a press which<br />\nrecognizes its role to illuminate,<br />\nexpose, guide, but not govern.\"<br />\nThe Presidential press<br />\nconference has become very<br />\ndegraded, Cater explained. What<br />\nonce had been an important<br />\nthough informal institution of<br />\ncommunication has turned into a<br />\nrare occasion under President<br />\nNixon.<br />\n\"It has become like a<br />\nprofessional wrestling match,\" he<br />\nremarked. \"There are a lot of<br />\ngrunts and groans, but basically,<br />\nthe public is poorly edified.\"<br />\nConferences<br />\n\"The next President will need<br />\nto recognize doing it regularlS, is<br />\nvery valuable.\" The implication<br />\nof Cater's remark was that only<br />\nby holding such conferences<br />\nregularly \u2022 and allowing an<br />\nopportunity for reporters to<br />\nsystematically follow up<br />\nquestions could any degree of<br />\ncredibility be restored. While<br />\nnever explicitly answering the<br />\nquestion he had posed, Cater did<br />\nattempt to examine why there<br />\nappears to be a fundamental<br />\nconflict between the government<br />\nand the press. Explaining that<br />\nours is not a government of<br />\nseparated powers but rather a<br />\ngovernment of separated<br />\ninstitutions sharing power, Cater<br />\nasserted, that as a result, the<br />\npress had been put in a position<br />\nof power unique to, our system.<br />\n\"Given the separation of the<br />\n,nstitutions, there is a<br />\ncompetition among them for<br />\ncoverage,\" he stated. \"It is the<br />\nwielding such power,.<br />\npress<br />\nconstituted a \"fourth branch of<br />\ngovernment.\" He set forth these<br />\nviews in a book by that name in<br />\n1959.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4/news-letter/march 1; 1974<br />\n<br />\nSelf-generated pressure seen factor for pre-meds<br />\nP11E-MED, from page-1<br />\nMost faculty members and<br />\nstudents interviewed agreed that<br />\nmuch of the pressure is generated<br />\nby the students themselves.<br />\nAlthough they also agreed that<br />\nthe academics are not made<br />\nexcessively difficult in order to<br />\n<br />\ncreate competition and \"weed<br />\nout\" weaker students, Dr. Gryder<br />\nacknowledged that there are \"a<br />\nfew faculty members who resent<br />\npre-meds\" and may make things<br />\nrough for them.<br />\nMoreover, in the last four<br />\ngraduating classes, nearly half of<br />\n<br />\nthe students who originally<br />\nenrolled as pre-med students did<br />\nnot graduate as such.<br />\nCuriously, while the faculty<br />\nand students see the pressure and<br />\ncompetition in the program as<br />\npotentially disastrous for some<br />\nstudents, they see it as a<br />\n<br />\nHopkins eyes Russian historian<br />\nmember said \u2022<br />\nA history department source<br />\n\"Nothing is being done mainly<br />\nstated that Raeff's adjunct<br />\nbecause we have to proceed very .appointment was initiated by the<br />\ncarefully to keep the budget in<br />\nDean's office, and not the history<br />\nbalance.\"<br />\ndepartment itself.<br />\n\"At the slow pace we're<br />\nGreene said, \"If the money<br />\nmoving, we haven't any names,\"<br />\nwere available, we could do<br />\nOwen stated.<br />\nsomething rather quickly.\" He<br />\nAccording to Greene, \"There contended that Hopkins<br />\nwould<br />\nhas been some looking (for a be an attractive<br />\nspot for a<br />\nRussianist) this year.

School of Medicine,<br />\nspoke on \"A Western View of<br />\nAcupuncture\" in the Garrett<br />\nRoom of the MSE Library at this<br />\nweek's Wednesday Noon Series.<br />\nSpeaking before an _audience<br />\nof approximately 50 people,<br />\nBenson outlined a brief history<br />\nof acupuncture, desCribed its<br />\ntechniques and uses, and<br />\nexpressed his own attitudes on<br />\nthis subject, one which is<br />\nbecoming increasingly<br />\ncontroversial in medical circles.<br />\nAccording to Benson,<br />\nacupuncture originated in China<br />\nabout seven \u2022thousand years ago,<br />\nalthough the exact location and<br />\ndate are unknown. \"The Chinese<br />\nphilosophy of religion and life<br />\nhas a lot to do with<br />\nacupuncture,\" stated Benson.<br />\n\"They look at man as a<br />\nmicrocosmic image of the<br />\nuniverse and subject to identical<br /><br />\nuniversal laws,\"<br />\nAccording to Benson, Taoism<br />\nplayed an important part for the<br />\nChinese in formulating their<br />\ntheories about acupuncture.<br />\n\"Taoism used a dual force to<br />\nexplain many of nature's ways,<br />\nespecially changes and<br />\ndifferences,\" he explained.<br />\n\"These dual forces are the Yin<br />\narid the Yang.\"<br />\nThere are well over 1000 such<br />\nacupuncture points on the body.<br />\nThe knowledge as to which<br />\npoints when treated would lead<br />\nto successful results is, according<br />\nto Benson, \"based on the<br />\nempiricism of seven thousand<br />\nyears.\"<br />\n\"The Chinese arrived at the<br />\nvarious points that would relieve<br />\npain through what was basically a<br />\nhit and miss process. If some did<br />\nnot work, they tried others.\"<br />\nBenson expressed some<br />\nskepticism about the actual value<br />\nof acupuncture and believes that<br />\nfurther neurophysiological<br />\nresearch is necessary to place it in<br /><br />\nperspective. His belief that<br />\nacupuncture treatment may be<br />\nhelpful to atleast some patients<br />\nfor psychological reasons was<br />\nevident when he stated that<br />\n\"acupuncture can change your<br />\nperception of pain.\"<br />\nAnother problem with<br />\nacupuncture Benson contended,<br />\nis that many of its positive results<br />\nare based on data from<br />\nacupuncture patients who report<br />\na lessening in the degree of pain<br />\nor in the degree to which they<br />\nare affected. \"Since we have no<br />\nway of measuring the severity of<br />\npain and have to rely on what<br />\npatients tell us,\" he remarked,<br />\n\"almost all the results of the<br />\neffectiveness of acupuncture are<br />\nhighly subjective.\"<br />\nAs to why acupuncture has<br />\ngained acceptance in the United<br />\nStates so quickly, Benson<br />\nsuggested, \"the general<br />\ndisenchantment of-many people<br />\nwith the current American<br />\nmedical performance.\"<br />\nHe further elaborated, \"the<br /><br />\nundergrauate student body<br />\nturned out to vote in the<br />\nSymposium referendum, which<br />\nwas held as a result of a change in<br />\nthe process of selecting topics for<br />\nthe annual fall event. In previous<br />\nyears, the topic was selected by<br />\nthe Student Council selections<br />\ncommittee and then ratified by<br />\nthe full S.C. This year, for the<br />\nfirst time, the selections<br />\ncommittee picked three topics to<br />\nsubmit to a student vote for the<br />\nfinal choice.<br /><br />\npersonal contact which derives<br />\nfrom the one to one relationship<br />\nbetween the doctor and patient<br />\ninvolved in acupuncture, results<br />\nin the patient really believing<br />\nthat the doctor cares about him.<br />\nThus, the patient often feels<br />\nobligated to experience relief and<br />\nstrongly desires to do so.\"<br />\nAnother cause of<br />\nacupuncture's acceptance,<br />\naccording to Benson, is the<br />\n\"American penchant for<br />\naccepting new things at face<br />\nvalue. Just look at how fast<br />\npeople go out and buy anything<br />\nthey see advertised on<br />\ntelevision.\"<br />\nIn closing, Benson admitted<br />\nthat despite its possible<br />\ndrawbacks, acupuncture has<br />\nproved successful in many<br />\ninstances. He strongly<br />\nemphasized, however, that<br />\n\"although it has sometimes been<br />\neffective, it is by no means a<br />\npanacea. \"Rather, it is but one<br />\npossible means of treating a<br />\npatient.\"<br /><br />\nnation's capital. \"The press has<br />\nbecome preoccupied with the<br />\nform and not the substance of<br />\ngovernment,\" he explained.<br />\n\"What we need is a new press less<br />\ncynical about the problems of<br />\ngovernment,\" he added.<br />\niloobthTiso<br />\nHe blamed<br />\n\u00b0pbroblem in<br />\npart on television which he said,<br />\n\"tempts the President to prefer<br />\nform rather than substance.\"<br />\nCater stressed the need for<br />\nmore openness on the part of<br />\nPresidents and the<br />\nre-establishment of the<br />\npresidential press conference on a<br />\nregular basis as ways to bolster<br />\nthe credibility of the presidency.<br />\n\"In the post-Watergate<br />\nmorality, what we need will be<br />\nmore candid, less arrogant<br />\nPresidents,\" he said. \"But we will<br />\nalso need a press which<br />\nrecognizes its role to illuminate,<br />\nexpose, guide, but not govern.\"<br />\nThe Presidential press<br />\nconference has become very<br />\ndegraded, Cater explained. What<br />\nonce had been an important<br />\nthough informal institution of<br />\ncommunication has turned into a<br />\nrare occasion under President<br />\nNixon.<br />\n\"It has become like a<br />\nprofessional wrestling match,\" he<br />\nremarked. \"There are a lot of<br />\ngrunts and groans, but basically,<br />\nthe public is poorly edified.\"<br />\nConferences<br />\n\"The next President will need<br />\nto recognize doing it regularlS, is<br />\nvery valuable.\" The implication<br />\nof Cater's remark was that only<br />\nby holding such conferences<br />\nregularly \u2022 and allowing an<br />\nopportunity for reporters to<br />\nsystematically follow up<br />\nquestions could any degree of<br />\ncredibility be restored. While<br />\nnever explicitly answering the<br />\nquestion he had posed, Cater did<br />\nattempt to examine why there<br />\nappears to be a fundamental<br />\nconflict between the government<br />\nand the press. Explaining that<br />\nours is not a government of<br />\nseparated powers but rather a<br />\ngovernment of separated<br />\ninstitutions sharing power, Cater<br />\nasserted, that as a result, the<br />\npress had been put in a position<br />\nof power unique to, our system.<br />\n\"Given the separation of the<br />\n,nstitutions, there is a<br />\ncompetition among them for<br />\ncoverage,\" he stated. \"It is the<br />\nwielding such power,.<br />\npress<br />\nconstituted a \"fourth branch of<br />\ngovernment.\" He set forth these<br />\nviews in a book by that name in<br />\n1959.<br /><br />\npage 4/news-letter/march 1; 1974<br /><br />\nSelf-generated pressure seen factor for pre-meds<br />\nP11E-MED, from page-1<br />\nMost faculty members and<br />\nstudents interviewed agreed that<br />\nmuch of the pressure is generated<br />\nby the students themselves.<br />\nAlthough they also agreed that<br />\nthe academics are not made<br />\nexcessively difficult in order to<br /><br />\ncreate competition and \"weed<br />\nout\" weaker students, Dr. Gryder<br />\nacknowledged that there are \"a<br />\nfew faculty members who resent<br />\npre-meds\" and may make things<br />\nrough for them.<br />\nMoreover, in the last four<br />\ngraduating classes, nearly half of<br /><br />\nthe students who originally<br />\nenrolled as pre-med students did<br />\nnot graduate as such.<br />\nCuriously, while the faculty<br />\nand students see the pressure and<br />\ncompetition in the program as<br />\npotentially disastrous for some<br />\nstudents, they see it as a<br /><br />\nHopkins eyes Russian historian<br />\nmember said \u2022<br />\nA history department source<br />\n\"Nothing is being done mainly<br />\nstated that Raeff's adjunct<br />\nbecause we have to proceed very .appointment was initiated by the<br />\ncarefully to keep the budget in<br />\nDean's office, and not the history<br />\nbalance.\"<br />\ndepartment itself.<br />\n\"At the slow pace we're<br />\nGreene said, \"If the money<br />\nmoving, we haven't any names,\"<br />\nwere available, we could do<br />\nOwen stated.<br />\nsomething rather quickly.\" He<br />\nAccording to Greene, \"There contended that Hopkins<br />\nwould<br />\nhas been some looking (for a be an attractive<br />\nspot for a<br />\nRussianist) this year.
