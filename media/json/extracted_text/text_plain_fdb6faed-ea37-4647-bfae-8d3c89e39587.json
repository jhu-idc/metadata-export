There seem to have<br />\nbeen several such scares at the<br />\nuniversity over the recent years.<br />\nOne had everyone chanting<br />\n\"hotbed of Communism,\" and<br />\nanother lead the ivied halls ringing with laments over the insidious atheism which was \"invading our ranks.\" The following<br />\ntwo letters were turned up by<br />\nthe apathy poll and represent<br />\ntwo men's opinions on the matter. Further ideas on the problem and its solution are invited.<br />\n<br />\nDear old Johnny Hopkins must be Kiuite proud of himself, and deservedly so, since Hopkins has been chosen<br />\nas one of the five top universities \"already embarked on<br />\nfuture-development programs commensurate in scope, Student Indifference<br />\nimagination, and practicability to the vast needs of the To the Editors:<br />\nAmerican Society.\" The Ford Foundation's six million School spirit seems to be redollar grant to (THU, of which close to 2 million is avail- served almost solely for the fraable immediately, comes as quite a windfall.

The desire of the Foundation was great apathy in feeling that if<br />\nto fling a challenge to university administrators\u2014\"Let's they condescend to see the great<br />\nfootball team or lacrosse<br />\nsee how, using your wisdom and experience, you can put Hopkins<br />\nteam in action, then it is a time<br />\nall<br />\nnation.\"<br />\nIn<br />\nthe<br />\ngrowth<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nfor<br />\nwork<br />\nto<br />\nmoney<br />\nthis<br />\nfor drinking or for showing<br />\nsincerity, we shall be earnestly watching as this challenge greater interest in their girl than<br />\nin the game in which Hopkins<br />\nis met.<br />\n<br />\nStudent-Faculty Camp<br />\nWith such topics as \"the non-validity of articles\" and<br />\nthe \"advisability and advantage of having a News-Letter<br />\nfaculty advisor\" on the docket, we naturally ,went to the<br />\nStudent-Faculty Camp last week fearing the worst. Much<br />\nto our surprise, this year's crop of student leaders saw<br />\nthrough the prejudicial phraseology of these topics (they<br />\nwere suggested by last year's graduating major domos)<br />\nand concentrated on the real job of such a camp: communication between the various student organizations.<br />\nHence, Student-Faculty Camp, Hopkins' first, was a success.<br />\nOf course, there were shortcomings. It was scheduled<br />\nduring part of a Jewish holiday; the topics were not chosen<br />\nby the people who were going to discuss them; the camp<br />\nwas so organized that the same students and faculty<br />\ntraveled together through all four areas of discussion,<br />\nhearing the same attitudes and viewpoints for two straight<br />\ndays, even though the topics themselves may have changed.<br />\nNevertheless; it was gratifying to hear men like Dean<br />\nEvans, Dean Shaffer, Professor Hubbard, Dean Morrill,<br />\nOz Steinwald, Lynn Poole, Dr. Swanson, Mr. Bilgrave,<br />\nDr. Wickwire and others join student leaders to discuss<br />\ncampus problems. No policies came from the camp, but<br />\nmany ideas did. The News-Letter next week will examine<br />\nsonie of these.<br />\n<br />\nBig Boots<br />\nThe News-Letter wishes to welcome the class of 1964<br />\nand to wish them a rewarding four years at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. This is a unique institution, one justly<br />\nproud of its great traditions in all fields of learning. Unlike<br />\nthe so-called prestige schools, the Hopkins exists primarily<br />\nto prepare men for scholarship. The ranks of academic<br />\nposts throughout the nation are filled by distinguished<br />\nHopkins alumni.<br />\nEven those not preparing for academic posts, however,<br />\nwill benefit from the atmosphere of this school; pervading<br />\nalmost every classroom and laboratory is a constant,.<br />\nstimulating quest for knowledge. The best of the freshman class will progress in courses at their own rate and<br />\nwill do original research while still undergraduates.<br />\nAnd judging from Admissions Office reports, this<br />\nfreshman class is the brightest to hit Hopkins in Many<br />\nyears. We hope their expected .\"quality\" is proved by their<br />\nachievements.<br />\n<br />\nRushing<br />\nIt is with great interest that we shall view the success,<br />\nor failure, of the revamped rush schedule. We hope that<br />\ndue to the nature of the schedule, its tightness, and the<br />\namount of time it will take up, the problem of dirty rushing<br />\ncan be minimized.<br />\nTo all fraternity men, there is one point that has<br />\ncropped up since last year's commotion concerning equal<br />\nrights and privileges for all Hopkins students. It has<br />\nalways been thrown back to the University that it should<br />\nclean up its own back yard (namely its fraternities)<br />\nbefore it attacks discrimination off campus. Feeling very<br />\nstrongly about the need for equal rights for all Hopkins<br />\nstudents, we say that any fraternity that does not accept<br />\nwhat it terms a 'top man' because of his race, color, or<br />\ncreed is only, in the long run, deeply hurting itself.<br />\n<br />\nis being tested against a strong<br />\nopponent. Despite the valiant efforts of the booster club in importing female cheer-leaders, the<br />\nspirit is still wanting.<br />\nHouse spirit .s relatively<br />\nhigh because of inter-dorm competition in football or basketball, or in inter-dorm sings or<br />\nin sign contests.<br />\nFraternity spirit, on the other<br />\nhand, is very high. Because of<br />\nunity in escapades, the \"men\"<br />\nor \"brothers\" are united.<br />\nBut in general the Hopkins<br />\nspirit has a great deal lacking.<br />\nThe spirit, on the whole, is deplorable. This is not the fault<br />\nof the Booster Club or of the<br />\nAdministration, but rather of<br />\nthe students themselves, who<br />\n<br />\nandepice<br />\n<br />\nseem too indifferent to take an become immature and \"noninterest in their school.<br />\nIvy\" to show an intense inTed Ahren, terest in school activities.

There seem to have<br />\nbeen several such scares at the<br />\nuniversity over the recent years.<br />\nOne had everyone chanting<br />\n\"hotbed of Communism,\" and<br />\nanother lead the ivied halls ringing with laments over the insidious atheism which was \"invading our ranks.\" The following<br />\ntwo letters were turned up by<br />\nthe apathy poll and represent<br />\ntwo men's opinions on the matter. Further ideas on the problem and its solution are invited.<br /><br />\nDear old Johnny Hopkins must be Kiuite proud of himself, and deservedly so, since Hopkins has been chosen<br />\nas one of the five top universities \"already embarked on<br />\nfuture-development programs commensurate in scope, Student Indifference<br />\nimagination, and practicability to the vast needs of the To the Editors:<br />\nAmerican Society.\" The Ford Foundation's six million School spirit seems to be redollar grant to (THU, of which close to 2 million is avail- served almost solely for the fraable immediately, comes as quite a windfall.

Much<br />\nto our surprise, this year's crop of student leaders saw<br />\nthrough the prejudicial phraseology of these topics (they<br />\nwere suggested by last year's graduating major domos)<br />\nand concentrated on the real job of such a camp: communication between the various student organizations.<br />\nHence, Student-Faculty Camp, Hopkins' first, was a success.<br />\nOf course, there were shortcomings. It was scheduled<br />\nduring part of a Jewish holiday; the topics were not chosen<br />\nby the people who were going to discuss them; the camp<br />\nwas so organized that the same students and faculty<br />\ntraveled together through all four areas of discussion,<br />\nhearing the same attitudes and viewpoints for two straight<br />\ndays, even though the topics themselves may have changed.<br />\nNevertheless; it was gratifying to hear men like Dean<br />\nEvans, Dean Shaffer, Professor Hubbard, Dean Morrill,<br />\nOz Steinwald, Lynn Poole, Dr. Swanson, Mr. Bilgrave,<br />\nDr. Wickwire and others join student leaders to discuss<br />\ncampus problems. No policies came from the camp, but<br />\nmany ideas did. The News-Letter next week will examine<br />\nsonie of these.<br /><br />\nBig Boots<br />\nThe News-Letter wishes to welcome the class of 1964<br />\nand to wish them a rewarding four years at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. This is a unique institution, one justly<br />\nproud of its great traditions in all fields of learning. Unlike<br />\nthe so-called prestige schools, the Hopkins exists primarily<br />\nto prepare men for scholarship. The ranks of academic<br />\nposts throughout the nation are filled by distinguished<br />\nHopkins alumni.<br />\nEven those not preparing for academic posts, however,<br />\nwill benefit from the atmosphere of this school; pervading<br />\nalmost every classroom and laboratory is a constant,.<br />\nstimulating quest for knowledge. The best of the freshman class will progress in courses at their own rate and<br />\nwill do original research while still undergraduates.<br />\nAnd judging from Admissions Office reports, this<br />\nfreshman class is the brightest to hit Hopkins in Many<br />\nyears. We hope their expected .\"quality\" is proved by their<br />\nachievements.<br /><br />\nRushing<br />\nIt is with great interest that we shall view the success,<br />\nor failure, of the revamped rush schedule.

It has<br />\nalways been thrown back to the University that it should<br />\nclean up its own back yard (namely its fraternities)<br />\nbefore it attacks discrimination off campus. Feeling very<br />\nstrongly about the need for equal rights for all Hopkins<br />\nstudents, we say that any fraternity that does not accept<br />\nwhat it terms a 'top man' because of his race, color, or<br />\ncreed is only, in the long run, deeply hurting itself.<br /><br />\nis being tested against a strong<br />\nopponent.
