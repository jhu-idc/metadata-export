Janice L. Ono<br />\n<br />\nAnalysis<br />\n<br />\nTest Protest<br />\nThe student demonstration scheduled Thursday to<br />\nprotest the janitors' work hours is clearly designed to<br />\nreplicate the success achieved by the calendar change<br />\ndemonstration on Commemoration Day two years ago.<br />\nNext week's rally raises two fundamental questions about<br />\nthe nature of undergraduate participation in the University as an institution.<br />\nIn some ways, it is doubtful how many people are<br />\nreally interested in the plight of custodial workers. The<br />\nmove to change the calendar affected every student<br />\npersonally, while the personal problems experienced by<br />\njanitors who have to work nights cause nothing worse than<br />\nsympathy pains. Obviously, people who don't care about<br />\nthe janitor situation have no business going to a rally<br />\nunless, like the mobs which continue to wreak turmoil in<br />\nthe streets of Tehran, they enjoy causing trouble entirely<br />\nfor its own sake.<br />\nBut a more interesting problem is posed for students<br />\nwho are in fact committed to the janitor cause. They must<br />\ndecide whether a public demonstration is really an appropriate and effective means for redress. By refusing to<br />\nsanction the demonstration Wednesday night, the Student<br />\nCouncil has taken the position that such a rally, no matter<br />\nthe justice of the cause it advances, would be politically inept.<br />\nWhile this view may be realistic given the status quo at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, students could assume a fundamentally<br />\ndifferent role at this Uhiversity. Rather than customers<br />\nwho pass through for the simple purpose of purchasing an<br />\neducation, students actually form an integral part of the<br />\nacademic institution. Without students, there would be no<br />\nUniversity. However, students have very little institutional<br />\ncontrol over the affairs of the University. The power<br />\ninvested in the Student Council is nominal at best, so its<br />\nleaders know they must conserve its resources. But students who would like to see the janitors' hours changed<br />\nshould be able to take some action toward that goal.<br />\nOnly the non-institutional method of a demonstration<br />\nis available for them to use. So the rally Thursday is<br />\nappropriate. Whether it will be effective or not depends on<br />\nthe number, of students who feel the issue is significant and<br />\nWorth doing something about.<br />\n<br />\nstaff writers: Brian Becker, Paul Berchielli, Brent Berger, Roger Blumenthal,<br />\nPeter Cinquegrani, Andy Cohen, Paul Cooper, Kevil Duhon, David Einolf,<br />\nFelice Ekelman, Adrienne Grossman, Adam Gruen, Carol Huber, Mitch<br />\nHyman, David Kaplan, Vinay La!, Tom Langlois, Harry Lerner, Mark<br />\nNasdor, Marco Parillo, Lisa Pease, Elaine Pizzo, Steve Randall, Sara Robert,<br />\nDavid Senie, Devra Sirot, Ed Sullivan<br />\nLee Phillips,<br />\nproduction staff: Jim Gilligan, Bill Oberle, Nancy 01SZCWSKi,<br />\nPatti Smart, Patti Somerville, Daisy Taylor<br />\nJim Sidbury,<br />\nadvertising staff: Bruce Lenes, Madeline Rivlin, Sharon Sinsky, Ellen<br />\n<br />\nSkinner: Good But Scorned<br />\nBY ASHTON TRICE<br />\n<br />\nOccasionally, ironies of academic life are made apparent by<br />\nthe random pairing in time of<br />\ntwo campus events. Next week<br />\ntwo such events will occur at<br />\nHopkins which, one must<br />\nassume, are in no way mutually<br />\ndependent. These are yet<br />\nanother step in the \"resolution\"<br />\nof the janitorial crisis, and the<br />\nCommemoration Day address<br />\nby Professor B.F. Skinner.<br />\nSkinner's earliest work was<br />\nethological in character, dealing<br />\nwith innate behavior in the ant<br />\nand eating in the rat, but this<br />\nquickly led him to the design of<br />\nhis well-known \"environmental<br />\nchamber,\" the Skinner box. His<br />\nbox, unlike the boxes of his<br />\nintellectual forbearers, was programmed to dispense rewards for<br />\nwork, rather than to motivate<br />\nwork by inflicting aversive consequences for idleness. His rats<br />\nand pigeons have for years been<br />\npaid off for productivity under<br />\nrelatively pleasant \"working<br />\nconditions.\"<br />\nHis first foray into designing human environments was his<br />\ninfant air crib. The constraints<br />\n<br />\nof cumbersome clothes, the<br />\nintrusion of noise during sleeping time, and the ambient<br />\ninfection level of unfiltered air<br />\nwere eliminated during times<br />\nwhen children would normally<br />\nbe left in crib or play pen, and<br />\nparents were given anxiety-free<br />\nleisure time. In general, public<br />\nreaction was negative, although<br />\nthe results have been highly<br />\nThe Skinnerian<br />\nfavorable.<br />\nenvironment was too rational<br />\nand too well-controlled.<br />\nAlso too rational and controlled was the Utopian community described in his 1948<br />\nnovel, Walden 1111. Walden II<br />\nmaintained a high-level productivity based on efficient use of<br />\nwork time, thereby augmenting<br />\nleisure time, and by positive<br />\nrather than aversive control<br />\nmethods, including self-selection of work tasks and hours,<br />\nwithin the limitations based on<br />\ncommunity needs. The effectiveness of such methods has<br />\nbeen demonstrated, with some<br />\nmodifications, at Twin Oaks, a<br />\nSkinnerian commune in Virginia,<br />\nand on a smaller degree within a<br />\npsychology laboratory on the<br />\nHopkins campus.<br />\n<br />\nPredictably,<br />\nSkinner's<br />\ncommunity was attacked for<br />\ndenying individual freedom. He<br />\ncountered in his debate with<br />\nCarl Rogers, that 1) all behavior<br />\nis controlled in either a systematic or unsystematic way; 2)<br />\nthat systematic control produces<br />\nefficiency, thereby enhancing<br />\nleisure; and that 3) the visibility<br />\nof control can increase the<br />\nprobability of counter-control.<br />\nAs the authority controls those<br />\nbeneath her/him, the authority<br />\nis controlled by the behavior of<br />\nthose under authority.<br />\nSkinner's attention turned<br />\nto a more formal analysis of<br />\nsocial institutions in 1953 with<br />\nthe publication of Science and<br />\nHuman Behavior, which discussed the roles of government,<br />\nreligion, economic structures<br />\nand education. His basic complaint was that most social<br />\ninstitutions used aversive coercion rather than positive incentive to maintain productivity.<br />\nHis own \u201eingenious work he<br />\nattributed to leisure time to play<br />\nwith ideas as opposed to work,<br />\nwhich he found to be culturally<br />\ndefined as productivity to avoid<br />\nfrequently arbitrary punishment.<br />\n<br />\n'letters to the editor'<br />\nLAW<br />\n<br />\nFraternal Living<br />\nIn the next several weeks, many young men who<br />\nhappen to be Hopkins students will decide whether to join<br />\na fraternity. Perhaps they will find it difficult - considering<br />\nthat they are freshmen who can hardly be expected to<br />\nknow enough to make a choice that will affect the next<br />\nthree years of their lives.<br />\nMost people identify closely with their families from<br />\nthe time they are small children until the time they finish<br />\nhigh school. When they get to Hopkins, they are assigned<br />\nto the dorms, which usually provide a definite community<br />\nat<br />\nHowever, in their second year, Hopkins students are<br />\nforced to fend for themselves in the outside world. Some<br />\nhave friends with whom they can set up housekeeping;<br />\nSome do not. Most will end up experiencing some degree<br />\nof alienation.<br />\nGiven this scenario, fraternity life offers a young<br />\nperson a chance to continue as a member of a supportive<br />\ngroup. This can be valuable in cushioning a student from<br />\nthe emotional shock of life on his own. In some cases,<br />\nthough, it prevents people from maturing the way they<br />\nwould if they were independent.<br />\nThere are many different aspects to life in a fraternity.<br />\nMaturity and attitudes toward independence are perhaps<br />\nthe most important criteria freshmen should use in making<br />\ntheir decisions about rush.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to propose that<br />\nthe university consider creating a<br />\nlaw school. The physical requirements of such a school are<br />\nnot unreasonable - a library of<br />\napproximately 50,000 to start,<br />\nseveral lecture halls and classrooms, and an administrative<br />\nwing.<br />\nSuch a law school could<br />\ndraw upon faculty from the arts<br />\nand sciences, engineering and<br />\nmedical faculty of the university, as well as from SAIS, to<br />\nsupplement the regular law faculty. There could even be a six<br />\nyear B.A.-Juris Doctor or B.E.S.Juris Doctor tract similar to that<br />\noffered by the medical school.<br />\nThere is a real need for<br />\nmore accredited law schools<br />\ndespite the incorrect reports of a<br />\nsaturation of the job market for<br />\nlaw school graduates. Jobs for<br />\nlawyers are opening up in the<br />\nfields of public administration,<br />\nfinance, international trade as<br />\nwell as in the traditional areas of<br />\nlaw practice. Yet, the approximately 150 accredited law<br />\nschools are turning away thousands of highly qualified applicants for lack of space.<br />\nA Johns Hopkins University<br />\n<br />\nLaw Center would be a definite<br />\ncommitment to moving beyond<br />\nthe areas of science and medicine into a frontier where great<br />\nchallenges abound.<br />\nDavid Leland<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt was extremely disappointing to find the News-Letter of<br />\nFebruary 2 completely overlooked the performance of the<br />\nDuke Ellington Band in Shriver<br />\nHall on Tuesday, January 30.<br />\nWhat is altogether disheartening<br />\nis the News-Letter preferred to<br />\ndevote a half-page to the onstage effects and spectators'<br />\ncostumes comprising Heart's<br />\nshow that same night at the<br />\nCivic Center rather than cover<br />\nthis world-famous big-band that<br />\nmany jazz experts consider to<br />\nhave had the greatest influence<br />\non this type of music.<br />\nFor those completely unfamiliar with jazz names, Duke<br />\nEllington was the prolific writer<br />\nand arranger immortalized in<br />\nStevie Wonder's \"Sir Duke,\" and<br />\nranks with, if not above, Count<br />\nBasic and Bennie Goodman as<br />\nthe great leaders of big bands.<br />\nThe core of a big band consists<br />\nof five saxes (two alto, two<br />\n<br />\ntenor, one baritone), three to<br />\nfive trombones, three to five<br />\ntrumpets and rhythm (piano,<br />\nVariations<br />\nbass, drum set).<br />\nabound, often corresponding to<br />\nthe band leader's taste, e.g.<br />\nMaynard Ferguson's brass section is invariably strongest, even<br />\nwithout him. Ellington's band,<br />\nled by son Mercer, was strong in<br />\nall sections, though some may<br />\nhave been disappointed by no<br />\nadditions such as vibes or guitar.<br />\nThe concert featured marathon soloing by well-experienced<br />\ntenor player David Young, the<br />\nlast piece bassist Charlie Mingus<br />\never wrote (with an amazing<br />\nlatin introduction somewhere<br />\nbetween a mambo and bolero),<br />\nand the masterful scat singing<br />\nof Ms. Anita Moore.<br />\nThe Peabody Conservatory<br />\nPercussion Ensemble's performance at the Peabody Concert<br />\nHall that same night may have<br />\ncaused some conflicts of interest.

In American slang<br />\nthe word literally refers to a person who works<br />\nin carnival sideshows, whose principal act consists of biting the heads off of live chickens and<br />\nsnakes. Historically, before the Olympian games<br />\ncould begin, the people of Athens were required<br />\nto drag Aristotle by his feet twice around the<br />\ncity and then over to the playing area, where the<br />\nbleeding scholar would perform the gruesome<br />\nritual while being tickled by naked eunuchs.<br />\nAfter the ritual, the leaders of Athens would<br />\nencircle the twitching maniac and question him<br />\nas to the significance of his bizarre act, to which<br />\nAristotle would respond by 'moving his eyes<br />\nfrom one side to the other, repeating over and<br />\nover: \"Geek!

So with full awareness of the controversy<br />\nthat may result, I would wish to propose that Valentine's Day be abolished.<br />\nJanis Ian wasn't joking when she whined about \"the<br />\nvalentines that never came.\" Not getting valentines can<br />\nhurt; getting them can cause tragic repurcussions as well.<br />\nIn the seventh grade, I had a crush on a girl named Mary<br />\nEileen Langendorfenfelder who had the most fantastic<br />\noverbite I've ever seen. She was a quiet, diffident girl<br />\nwith one or maybe two friends. She had wide hazel eyes<br />\nand a voice as soft as velvet. For months we had been<br />\nsneaking surreptitious glances at each other during class,<br />\nbut we never spoke. (This, incidentally, was the approach I used on females until last October.) With<br />\nValentine's Day a week away, I decided to send her a<br />\nhandmade card with a heart and my name on it.<br />\nWhen the big day arrived and Sister Atilla began<br />\nhanding out the valentines, my heart started pounding<br />\nlouder than the drum solo in \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.\" I<br />\nfixed my eyes on Mary Eileen, waiting for her reaction<br />\nas she opened my card. Somehow I envisioned a Clairol<br />\ncommercial, with her reading the valentine and then<br />\nrunning across the room in slow motion, her arms<br />\nreaching for me, her long tresses bouncing on her shoulder. Finally, and so slowly, she took the cardifrom the<br />\nenvelope and read it. Her head jerked up abruptly and<br />\nshe looked at me with her jaw almost touching the St.<br />\nTheresa medal that hung from her neck. I smiled at her,<br />\nbut she turned away, a tough, triumphant, nearly vicious<br />\ngrin growing on her face. She never looked at me again.<br />\nThe next day, and every day after that, she came to<br />\nschool with her skirt raised a few dramatic inches, a<br />\ntouch of rouge on her cheeks, and her blouse revealing<br />\nfor the first time some pubescent cleavage. The loud<br />\ngum-gnawing Lolitas of the class became her mates. In a<br />\nfew weeks' time, she bagged the captain of the boys'<br />\nbasketball team. With that lonesome little handmade<br />\ncard, I created a monster. I turned a sweet demure lass<br />\ninto a painted courtesan. I (or rather, my valentine)<br />\nshowed her that she was indeed attractive to males.<br />\nOvernight she attained an awesome amount of self-confidence, and chose to go after bigger and better<br />\ngame than I seemed to promise. For months afterward<br />\nI fantasized about going to Mary Eileen's house. In this<br />\n't<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nNon kk lays, A &try lilcvn runs a boarding house<br />\n<br />\nfor wayward dwarf(leiitists.<br />\n<br />\nNo Way<br />\n<br />\nCont. from p. 8<br />\ncouldn't count - there were about six from Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe number of Hopkins students steadily involved is<br />\nhard to determine, but none of the freshmen surveyed<br />\nfor this article wanted to attend any further meetings.<br />\nOne student had been attracted by the friendliness<br />\nof' the people and the 'nice atmosphere\" of the meetings.<br />\nShe is not a Christian, but is interested in the Bible's<br />\nguidelines for life. She thought the speaking in tongues<br />\nwas strange and that the class was a money gimmick.<br />\nThe Way members had not told her exactly how much<br />\nthe class would cost, but insisted that it was worth the<br />\nprice. After being pursued by Way Fellowship members<br />\nwho had only met her once before, she felt they cared<br />\nlcss about her as a person than about making her take<br />\nthe _class. This student was not convinced by a movie<br />\nentitled Changed. an introduction to The Way showing<br />\n<br />\nby Patrick Ercolano<br />\n<br />\ntwisted dream of mine, she would open the front door<br />\nand I would pause long and balefully, entrancing her<br />\nwith my steely gaze. Then, with a cigarette dangling<br />\nfrom my lips, I'd mutter, \"Your loss, sugar,\" and drill<br />\nher with a slug from my .45 .<br />\nHad it not<br />\nbeen for Va'lentine's Day, I probably would have been<br />\nspared some torturous phantasms.<br />\nThe confusion surrounding the identity of St.<br />\nValentine is another valid reason to do away with \"the<br />\nlover's holiday.\" Does anyone actually know or care<br />\nwho the guy was? Allegedly, there were two St. Valentines, both of whom lived around A.D. 270. They were<br />\ncanonized for some minor good deeds - they had converted some lepers to Christianity, loaned some people a<br />\ncouple bucks, whatever. If such lax standards applied<br />\ntoday, every person who tossed a quarter to a Bowery<br />\nbum would be up for sainthood. Moreover, my trusty<br />\nHenry W. Jenkins Funeral Service calendar lists February<br />\n14 as the feast day of Saints Cyril and Methodius.<br />\nThere's no mention whatsoever of any \"St. Valentine.\"<br />\nPersonally, I think this Valentine guy was probably some<br />\nhuchster on the make for some publicity gratis. It may<br />\nnot be a bad idea to write letters to the Vatican calling<br />\nfor an investigation.<br />\n<br />\nA Valentine's Day custom in Utah decrees that each<br />\n<br />\nyoung women epoxy her head to her beloved's chest,<br />\n<br />\nWhat kind of holiday is Valentine's Day after all?<br />\nNo one gets off work, schools stay open, parking<br />\nmeters must be fed. To use a popular collegiate word,<br />\nit's bogus. Madison Avenue has us thinking \"holiday\" so we go out and buy the greeting cards, the<br />\nflowers, and the candy. And what about the popular<br />\n(and, I would add, totally erroneous) conception<br />\nof the heart'? You don't have to be a pre-med to<br />\nknow what a heart really looks like. It's not twicerounded at the top and pointed at the bottom. The<br />\nidea! Next to Disco Nite, a beating heart has to be<br />\none of the most repulsive sights anyone would care to<br />\nsee. It has numerous tubes and veins going into it, out<br />\nof it, through it, around it. Each year millions of<br />\nschoolchildren receive the shock of a lifetime when<br />\nthey finally discover the heart's true appearance.<br />\nSuch a powerful jolt of reality at an early age leaves<br />\nemotional scars and builds future distrust of adults.<br />\nThis is no laughing matter.<br />\nI have dredged up some international Valentine's<br />\nDay customs which are so farcical as to cause even<br />\nthe staunchest pro-Valentinean to think twice. In<br />\nSicily, young unmarried women rise before dawn and<br />\nstand by their windows. Each girl believes that the<br />\n<br />\nfirst man she sees will become her bridegroom within<br />\nthe year. This should tell you something about<br />\nSicilian women. Odds are that the first man who<br />\ncomes along is involved in linen supplies and cement<br />\novershoes, and has little interest in superstitious<br />\nguineas.<br />\nOn the eve of Valentine's Day, unmarried English<br />\ngirls pin bay leaves to their pillows. According to this<br />\ncustom, each girl will see her future husband in her<br />\ndreams. What usually happens, however, is that she<br />\nwakes up with her mouth and ears full of bay leaves.<br />\nA bad start like this is sure to put a crimp in one's<br />\nfestive valentine mood.<br />\nScandanavian tradation dictates that on February<br />\n14 each unwed girl should strike her forehead with a<br />\nfolded rose petal. If the petal cracks, then the girl<br />\nknows that her valentine loves her. If her forehead<br />\ncracks, then she knows that she'd best forget about<br />\nvalentines for a while.<br />\nThose are some of the more staid Valentaine's<br />\nDay customs. To prevent the pathetic spinsters<br />\nof the world from making total ninnies of themselves<br />\nwith these inane rituals, this so-called \"holiday\" must<br />\nbe put away in a safe place where it won't harm<br />\nanybody.<br />\nHow, you might ask, can this be done? Beats me.<br />\nI've considered skipping the date completely,jumping<br />\nfrom February 13th right to the 15th. But that idea<br />\nisn't too plausible in the long run. Not many people<br />\ncan sleep for 24 hours straight, or would want to. As<br />\nit is, there's barely enough time to do all our numerous chores and duties anyway. Therefore, those of us<br />\nwho love to hate Valentine's Day are forced to find<br />\nanother excuse to celebrate the date (since no one<br />\nlikes to get left out of a party). Being an avid baseball<br />\nfan, I have spent the last few February 14ths paying<br />\nsilent homage to a young outfielder for the Montreal<br />\nExpos named Ellis Valentine. The man has a rifle arm<br />\nthat is worthy of one day of celebration, at least by a<br />\nbaseball nut; and this way I get to observe \"Valentine's Day\" without worrying about cards and flowers<br />\nand noxious little \"heart-shaped\" candy that has<br />\n\"Luv Ya\" etched on top.<br />\nConspicuously and happily absent from this past<br />\nWednesday's newscasts were reports of young ladies<br />\nwho had split their noggins with folded rose petals or<br />\nwoken with bay leaves on their teeth. Good thing,<br />\nbecause if I had run across any such cases, I would<br />\nhave been very stingy with sympathy. In fact, I really<br />\nwouldn't have cared. I was too busy hoping that<br />\nEllis Valentine, wherever he might have been, was<br />\nenjoying his day.<br />\n<br />\nhow the PFAL class has altered certain people's lives.<br />\nShe felt the case histories shown in the movie were<br />\nextreme.<br />\nAnother student had more objections. She thinks<br />\nthe group was exploitive in its \"focus on a few individuals they feel might have emotional doubts and taking<br />\nadvantage of a weakness not to turn them down.\" She<br />\nalso said that \"while getting a new person is an ego trip,<br />\nthe organization as a whole is money-conscious.\" The<br />\nrelationship between members' and Wierwille, founder of<br />\nThe Way ministry and its \"star\" according to one<br />\nstudent in the film about the group, is one of blind<br />\ndevotion.<br />\nThe Christian Fellowship on campus, a division of<br />\nthe Intervarsity Christian Fellowship, has discussed what<br />\nit believes to be reasons for The Way's lack of popularity. According to some of the Fellowship organizers,<br />\nan abundant and powerful life may not appeal to Hopkins students as much as to other people because they<br />\n<br />\nare on the whole well off. In other words,\"They have an<br />\nabundant life already.\" They also suggested that The<br />\nWay's policy of denying the .deity of Christ would turn<br />\naway the majority of Christians who believe that Christ<br />\nis God.<br />\nThough The Way continues trying to attract interest<br />\nat Hopkins, it has not been able to become firmly<br />\nestablished on campus. The reasons for this vary from<br />\nperson to person, but one student familiar with the<br />\nfellowship suggested two explanations that can be more<br />\ngenerally applied. She claimed that most members were<br />\nolder people; \"When students join a group they are<br />\ninterested in being with their peers.\" And, finally; she<br />\nadded that, on the average, \"They (Way members)<br />\nare non-questioning; students are questioning.\"<br />\nThe Christian Fellowship is a more established<br />\ngroup on campus, having been at Hopkins for six or<br />\nseven years and maintains a stable membership of about<br />\n35, with others who occasionally attend meetings.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nItbile Janis Ian whined about \"the valentines that<br />\nnever came\", other people have their own unique<br />\nmethodsfor wreaking vengeance.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER /PAGE 13<br />\n<br />\nF<br />\n<br />\nThe Rathskeller<br />\nSIOeuxilk Barcet<br />\n<br />\n3900 HAIR BREEZE<br />\nINC.<br />\n3900 N.

Each<br />\nfamily member loves and respects the<br />\nothers while remaining absorbed in his<br />\nown world.<br />\nThe inevitable conflict arises when<br />\nthe family collides head-on with the real<br />\nworld of business, etiquette, and indigestion. Essie's sister, Alice (the only \"normal\" one in the family), falls in love with<br />\nthe boss' son, Tony Kirby. The two<br />\nfamilies must meet. Convinced that his<br />\nfamily should see the Sycamores as they<br />\nreally are, Tony brings his parents to<br />\ndinner at the Sycamores' one night earlier<br />\nthan had been planned - and bedlam<br />\nensues. Not only does the family cheerfully and relentlessly pursue its eccentricities, but G-men arrest the entire household and guests for Communist subversion.

Baby came out in 1977,<br />\nit received mixed reviews. Some critics<br />\nconsidered it one of the most beautiful<br />\nand artistic films ever released, claiming<br />\nthat director Louis Malle had taken a<br />\nhitherto taboo and treated it in an<br />\nimaginative and compassionate manner.<br />\nOthers denounced it 'as an exploitative<br />\npicture--one that used the extremely<br />\ntouchy subject of child prostitution for<br />\npurely capitalistic ends. This was merely<br />\n\"sexploitation\" in a different guise;<br />\nperhaps not as blatent as Charlie's Angels,<br />\nbut with the same idea in mind. That the<br />\nstory was only partly factual added even<br />\nmore fuel to the fire; some critics declared it to be an attempt to take a single<br />\nfootnote of history and sensationalize it<br />\nin order to cater to mass appeal. Between<br />\nthese two extremes was a surprisingly<br />\n<br />\nlimited body of opinion, for this was<br />\nmovie that few could feel ambivalent<br />\ntowards. However, Pretty Baby is basically an ambivalent movie. Like a great<br />\nnumber of films, it has both strong points<br />\nand defects; in the long run,it boils down<br />\nto a matter of personal preference.<br />\nPretty Baby is set in New Orleans in.<br />\na place called Storyville, the city's redlight district. The plot centers on the<br />\ndevelopment of Violet, the daughter of a<br />\nprostitute who is herself \"learning\" the<br />\ntrade. In a sense, we see the goings-on<br />\nwithin the house through her eyes. The<br />\ncamera perspective and the action seem<br />\nto be centered around Violet and her<br />\nview of the other prostitutes and male<br />\ncustomers.<br />\nA second story line consists of the<br />\nrelationship between Violet and E.J.<br />\nBellocq (Keith Carradine), a photographer who has been assigned to produce<br />\na pictorial essay on the prostitutes.<br />\nInitially disgusted with the goings-on, he<br />\nbegins to take an interest in Violet which<br />\nturns into full-blown romantic love. The<br />\nfilm never fully resolves why his affection<br />\nturns from paternal to romantic\u2014the<br />\nviewer is simply forced to accept the fact.<br />\nThis highlights what is perhaps the<br />\nfundamental weakness in the film; the<br />\nplot is not always fully developed. It lags<br />\nin several spots, and probably could have<br />\nended with greater effect. However, the<br />\nfault in this case does not lie with either<br />\nthe director or the actors, but with the<br />\nscreenwriter.

It is especially reminiscent of Saturday Night<br />\nLive's Norman Lear satire of a Pittsburgh<br />\nsnake-handling family which includes a<br />\nnun, a homosexual state police officer, a<br />\nunion boss husband, and his white-collar<br />\nexecutive wife. But the weaknesses which<br />\nSaturday Night parodies is the strength of<br />\nKaufman and Hart's play: modern<br />\nsit-corns exploit eccentric characters<br />\nmerely for shock value; You Can't<br />\nTake It With You uses them to embellish<br />\n<br />\nits theme and contribute to the overall<br />\ncomic effect. In other words, if the<br />\nSaturday Night family were not snake<br />\nhandlers, they would become a part of<br />\nnormal society - and cease to be different<br />\nand itneresting.

He<br />\ncame to grips with his homosexuality, but<br />\nas the film begins he is again confronted<br />\nwith a dilemna, this time in the form of<br />\nhis inclination to dress in women's<br />\nclothing. In the gay culture, it seems, a<br />\ndrag queen is considered below the<br />\n\"straight\" gay. At the hair salon where<br />\nRobin works, his gay employer acknowledges the primary function is to make<br />\nwomen look and feel beautiful, but he<br />\ndoesn't want drag queens working in his<br />\nshop. When a customer discovers Robin's<br />\nstatus in the gay world, the employer<br />\nimmediately fires him.<br />\nThis is the cue for Robin to pursue a<br />\ncareer as a female impersonator, something he had been dabbling with,but was<br />\nstill unsure about. Gradually, he perfects<br />\nhis talent for impersonating the great<br />\nwomen of the silver screen, and by the<br />\nend of the film he has transcended the<br />\nlabel of drag queen and gives a dazzling<br />\nperformance of Channing, Dietrich, Garland among others in a respectable New<br />\nYork club.<br />\n<br />\nLiza (Hollis Mc Lauren) is a schizophrenic who has spent eight years in a<br />\nmental hospital. In her opening shot, she<br />\nis running through the streets of Toronto<br />\nin her robe and slippers, escaping from<br />\nthe hospital. She turns to Robin, her only<br />\nfriend. Liza moves in and attempts to<br />\novercome her mental condition. She<br />\nalways carries a large scrapbook in which<br />\nshe collects her thoughts and feelings.<br />\nWhen a friend in publishing reads her<br />\nwriting, she insists there is potential for<br />\nLiza's poetry and fiction. Liza is supportive of Robin's career, and he, M turn, of<br />\nher sturggle to make it in the world<br />\nwithout hospitals, without treatment,<br />\nwithout drugs. Liza gets her pills con-fused, though, and gets pregnant, a risk<br />\nher doctor says is dangerous in her<br />\ncondition. She survives the pregnancy,<br />\nand by the end of the film, although she<br />\nstill hallucinates and needs treatment,<br />\nshe has realized the simple fact that she is<br />\nalive and can function outside a mental<br />\nhospital.<br />\nIf Outrageous had been made in<br />\nHollywood (it is Canadian), this tender<br />\nfilm would be a melodramatic tearjerker.<br />\nBut the treatment by director Richard<br />\nBenner is realistic and precise. A combination of a drag queen and a schizophrenic is odd, but Benner doesn't exploit this<br />\nfeature by creating stereotypes. Robin<br />\nand Liza are not approximations, but<br />\nbold and convincing characters. Robin's<br />\nrise to stardom probably parallels in<br />\n<br />\nmany ways that of Craig Russell, whose<br />\nperformance both as himself and especially as the females he impersonates is<br />\nbrilliant. Liza's moments of hallucination<br />\nand hysteria are frightening, and she<br />\nsustains a sense of her mental illness<br />\nthroughout the film. The visual style and<br />\ncinematography of Outragious is its<br />\nweakest point, probably because director<br />\nBenner was more concerned with the<br />\naccurate portrayal of his characters and<br />\ntheir struggle.<br />\nOne of the most interesting aspects<br />\nof the film is the insight it gives into a<br />\nsub-culture never seen by most of the<br />\npopulation: the gay bar. The scenes in a<br />\nbar in Toronto and in the much tougher<br />\nlooking Jack Rabbit Club in New York<br />\nwere not exploited as glimpses of decadence by the straight world; they are<br />\nportrayed with restraint and taste. The<br />\nscenes within the gay bars are interesting,<br />\nnot because they appeal to our baser<br />\ninstincts or lewd imaginations, but<br />\nbecause they show us something we<br />\nrarely if ever see.<br />\nOutrageous sets itself up to make<br />\nunfair judgements and gross generalizations as to the nature of the relationship<br />\nbetween society and the world of the<br />\nsocial misfit. \"crazies,\" and he can't<br />\nUnderstand why the world spoils special<br />\n.i)eople as he implores her to be dazzling.<br />\nLiza herself is always crying out against<br />\nher mother who wants her back in the<br />\nwhite padded cell, and the psychologist<br />\n<br />\nTrash Fits The Bill<br />\n. Trash has one thing going for it -- it<br />\nwas appropriately named. Andy Warhol's<br />\n1971 expose of a junkie living in a<br />\nperpetual hippie's dream near New York's<br />\nFillmore Theatre is exactly what it is<br />\nlabeled: trash.<br />\nIn keeping with other Warhol films,<br />\nthere is as little \"plot\" as possible. The<br />\nspontaneity of the dialogue is also proof<br />\nthat no script was used. It is often difficult to decide whether Warhol pur-<br />\n<br />\nposely used one camera to give Trash a all rich or straight people as shockingly<br />\ndocumentary look, or if he didn't have dumb. Trash attempts to make the<br />\nenough money to hire a second camera- audience feel any emotional impact<br />\nman. In other words, Trash looks like a whatsoever -- be it shock or simply the<br />\nfilm with little effort, money or skill laughs which accompany, any flop of a<br />\nbehind it.<br />\nmovie -- are all unsuccessful. Trash is as<br />\nTo make matters worse, Warhol tries impotent as the junkie it tries to describe.<br />\ndesperately to be shocking. There are<br />\nAll of the women in Trash wear an<br />\noverdrawn needle-in-arm drug scenes, overall white face make-up which covers<br />\nrape scenes, impotency scenes, mastur- their skin. These sickly creatures of<br />\nbation scenes and a general portrayal of Warhol's misplaced nightmare would<br />\nprobably be more comfortable in a circus<br />\nTITLE<br />\nMANUFACTURER<br />\nNO.<br />\nfreak show than in a movie. They are<br />\nTPASF<br />\nsuch bizarre specimens of American<br />\nsub-culture that, in comparison, Divine.<br />\nlooks like Sophia Loren.

This world is not the least bit<br />\npretty, but Trash is too exaggerated to be<br />\ntaken seriously, and the film has no<br />\nemotional imapct.<br />\nThe edited version of Trash which<br />\nwill be shown this weekend will have even<br />\nless impact -- the Maryland Board of<br />\nCensors has ordered scenes cut.

Young<br />\nMr. Forbert has produced an impressive<br />\nand very enjoyable debut album, Alive on<br />\nArrival(Nemperor/CBS).<br />\nForbert's lead vocals, guitar, and<br />\nharmonica are sparingly accented by top<br />\nsession sidemen Steve Burgh and Hugh<br />\nMcDonald (David Bromberg) along with<br />\nace saxophonist David Sanborn (Born to<br />\nRun) among others. The lean sound<br />\nshowcases the songs themselves, alternatively easygoing or passionate without<br />\nlapsing into\"mellow\" or hysteria. The<br />\ntunes have a clean, honest shine to them,<br />\na grinning, toe-tapping recklessness.<br />\nconfidently refuses the false<br />\nArrival<br />\nrefuge of lush production overkill, a<br />\npitfall that claimed recent releases from<br />\nCat Stevens, Elton John and Billy Joel,<br />\nthe aging pop giants of the genre.<br />\nForbert arrives without pretensions,<br />\nbut full of ambition. Poetry, humor,<br />\npathos; words and music, this boy wants<br />\nit all. His approach is simple and effective.<br />\nMany of the lyrics are autobiographical accounts of a Southern boy<br />\ncome to the big city to play his music,<br />\na 70's Johnny B. Goode. Forbert, a<br />\nMississippi kid, captures both the newcomer's bemused wonder (Grand Central<br />\nStation, March 18,1977 and Big City Cat)<br />\nand its flip side, a battered loneliness<br />\n(Tonight I Feel so Far Away From<br />\nHome). The album's best cut, \"Steve<br />\nForbert's Midsummer Night's Toast\",<br />\nunites both perspectives in a portrait of a<br />\nGreenwich Village poet:<br />\n\"I've been living and breathing in the<br />\nrat trap town,<br />\nTrying to get over where the wall<br />\nbreaks down,<br />\nHolding my head up with illy thin,<br />\ntired arms<br />\nAnd all my rainbow dreams'.\"<br />\nForbert's insistent rasping voice<br />\nworks well on these hard edged songs, as<br />\nwell as on the revved up rocker \"You<br />\nCannot Win If You Do Not Play\", but<br />\nbegins to grate on the more gentle ballads. Of these, the nebulous \"It Isn't<br />\nGonna Be That Way\" is a lyrical low<br />\npoint, but \"Settle Down\" charms easily<br />\nand \"Thinldn\" is a Spring sentiment that<br />\nwill melt the frost off your Charm City<br />\nwin dowpan es.<br />\nCont. on p. 16<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 16 / FEBRUARY 16, 1979<br />\n<br />\nPretty Baby<br />\nCont. from p. 14<br />\nstory could have been handled in a more<br />\ninteresting and perceptive way.<br />\nStill, the plot structure does not<br />\nseem to be Louis Malle's primary interest.<br />\nIt is an overall impression we are presented with, less a story than a picture,<br />\nand a beautiful picture at that. The<br />\ncamera seems intent upon capturing every<br />\ndetail and offering the viewer a panoramic vision. The perspective is vital to<br />\nthe message conveyel, as is the quality<br />\nand the texture of the picture itself. The<br />\nuse of light and darkness, the blurry,<br />\ndream-like quality and the sophisticated<br />\ncamera movements add something to<br />\nPretty Baby which few other movies<br />\npossess.<br />\nFor the photography alone, Pretty<br />\nBaby is well worth seeing. The acting is<br />\nnot superb, but it is good enough. The<br />\nthematic development could also withstand' critical censure, and the film is<br />\ndefinitely not exploitative. What makes<br />\nthe film is the cinematography and<br />\ninnovative use of pattern and color.<br />\n\u2014David Kaplan<br />\n<br />\nChamber Orchestra<br />\nOffers Musical Outlet<br />\n<br />\nNo Mercy,along with Ned,<br />\nin the Glass Pavilion tonight<br />\nCont. from p. 15<br />\nLargely because of superficial parallels of voice and appearance, Steven<br />\nForbert has been burdened with that<br />\ndeadliest of rock labels,\"the new Dylan\"<br />\nalbatross that crippled the careers of folks<br />\nlike John Prine. With this first album,<br />\nForbert is not yet ready to play in that<br />\nleague, but Alive on Arrival may qualify<br />\nhim as rookie of the year.

PARILLO<br />\nLast Saturday, despite the<br />\nconfusion generated by running<br />\n3 meets simultaneously in<br />\nHaverford's fieldhouse, it soon<br />\nbecame obvious that the Hopkins fencers would continue<br />\ntheir dominance over MAC opponents Haverford and UMBC,<br />\nas the Blue Jays beat Haverford<br />\n20-7 and UMBC 19-8, raising<br />\ntheir season record to a glittering<br />\n17-3 with 4 meets to go.<br />\nHopkins used its best fencers against Haverford, and was<br />\nwell rewarded as epeeman Adam<br />\nStern, and sabremen Paul Cordts<br />\nand Nate Graham each went 3-0.<br />\nThe foilmen, Erick Newman,<br />\nEvans Starzinger and Dave<br />\nMeyer each went 2-1, as did the<br />\nother two epeemen, Keith Pesto<br />\nand John Osby. The other<br />\nsabremen John Loonsk and<br />\nMike Schwerin, were 1-0 and 0-2<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nAgainst UMBC, Hopkins<br />\nregulars were sidelined as Coach<br />\nOles decided to give the meet to<br />\nhis subs to win or lose. The<br />\nresponse this time was overwhelming.<br />\nSabremen<br />\nMike<br />\nSchwerin, John Loonsk and Jim<br />\nFowler went 1-2, 3-0 and 2-1<br />\nrespectively. The epeemen didn't<br />\nfare quite so \u2022 well; John Osby<br />\n<br />\nwas 1-2 , Dave Nover 2-1 and<br />\nJames Newman 2-1 but on the<br />\nfoil team Dave Meyer and Kevin<br />\nGranville were undefeated and<br />\nMarco Parillo was 2-1. John<br />\nLoonsk won the deciding bout<br />\nagainst UMBC, while Keith Pesto<br />\n\"Took the Bird\" by winning the<br />\nclincher against Haverford.<br />\nCoach Oles, as he has often<br />\nbeen lately, was pleased with the<br />\nBlue Jay performance. \"The<br />\nfinal scores were not really<br />\nindicative of the relative<br />\nstrengths of the teams\", the Jay<br />\nmentor noted. \"There are 27<br />\ntotal bouts in each match, and<br />\nwe won the Haverford meet at<br />\n14-6, while UMBC was beaten with our subs at 14-4. Our<br />\npolicy is to win 14 bouts and<br />\nthen substitute, so a close final<br />\nscore is not necessarily a good<br />\nindication that the meet was a<br />\nclose one.\"<br />\nThis Saturday the Jay<br />\nswordsmen travel north again to<br />\nmeet Rutgers (Newark) and<br />\nSeton Hall before returning<br />\nhome for a final doubleheader<br />\non the 24th. Coach Oles feels<br />\nthat the SHU Pirates are the one<br />\nteam left on the schedule that<br />\ncould still beat the Jays, but<br />\nsays, \"The way things have<br />\nbeen going, don't look for an<br />\nupset.\"<br />\n<br />\nArmstrong Shines<br />\n<br />\nThe 1979 Women's Varsity Fencing Team<br />\n<br />\nLady Blades Hot to Score<br />\nBY KATHLEEN M.

Ono<br /><br />\nAnalysis<br /><br />\nTest Protest<br />\nThe student demonstration scheduled Thursday to<br />\nprotest the janitors' work hours is clearly designed to<br />\nreplicate the success achieved by the calendar change<br />\ndemonstration on Commemoration Day two years ago.<br />\nNext week's rally raises two fundamental questions about<br />\nthe nature of undergraduate participation in the University as an institution.<br />\nIn some ways, it is doubtful how many people are<br />\nreally interested in the plight of custodial workers. The<br />\nmove to change the calendar affected every student<br />\npersonally, while the personal problems experienced by<br />\njanitors who have to work nights cause nothing worse than<br />\nsympathy pains. Obviously, people who don't care about<br />\nthe janitor situation have no business going to a rally<br />\nunless, like the mobs which continue to wreak turmoil in<br />\nthe streets of Tehran, they enjoy causing trouble entirely<br />\nfor its own sake.<br />\nBut a more interesting problem is posed for students<br />\nwho are in fact committed to the janitor cause. They must<br />\ndecide whether a public demonstration is really an appropriate and effective means for redress. By refusing to<br />\nsanction the demonstration Wednesday night, the Student<br />\nCouncil has taken the position that such a rally, no matter<br />\nthe justice of the cause it advances, would be politically inept.<br />\nWhile this view may be realistic given the status quo at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, students could assume a fundamentally<br />\ndifferent role at this Uhiversity. Rather than customers<br />\nwho pass through for the simple purpose of purchasing an<br />\neducation, students actually form an integral part of the<br />\nacademic institution. Without students, there would be no<br />\nUniversity. However, students have very little institutional<br />\ncontrol over the affairs of the University. The power<br />\ninvested in the Student Council is nominal at best, so its<br />\nleaders know they must conserve its resources. But students who would like to see the janitors' hours changed<br />\nshould be able to take some action toward that goal.<br />\nOnly the non-institutional method of a demonstration<br />\nis available for them to use. So the rally Thursday is<br />\nappropriate.

Next week<br />\ntwo such events will occur at<br />\nHopkins which, one must<br />\nassume, are in no way mutually<br />\ndependent. These are yet<br />\nanother step in the \"resolution\"<br />\nof the janitorial crisis, and the<br />\nCommemoration Day address<br />\nby Professor B.F. Skinner.<br />\nSkinner's earliest work was<br />\nethological in character, dealing<br />\nwith innate behavior in the ant<br />\nand eating in the rat, but this<br />\nquickly led him to the design of<br />\nhis well-known \"environmental<br />\nchamber,\" the Skinner box. His<br />\nbox, unlike the boxes of his<br />\nintellectual forbearers, was programmed to dispense rewards for<br />\nwork, rather than to motivate<br />\nwork by inflicting aversive consequences for idleness. His rats<br />\nand pigeons have for years been<br />\npaid off for productivity under<br />\nrelatively pleasant \"working<br />\nconditions.\"<br />\nHis first foray into designing human environments was his<br />\ninfant air crib. The constraints<br /><br />\nof cumbersome clothes, the<br />\nintrusion of noise during sleeping time, and the ambient<br />\ninfection level of unfiltered air<br />\nwere eliminated during times<br />\nwhen children would normally<br />\nbe left in crib or play pen, and<br />\nparents were given anxiety-free<br />\nleisure time. In general, public<br />\nreaction was negative, although<br />\nthe results have been highly<br />\nThe Skinnerian<br />\nfavorable.<br />\nenvironment was too rational<br />\nand too well-controlled.<br />\nAlso too rational and controlled was the Utopian community described in his 1948<br />\nnovel, Walden 1111. Walden II<br />\nmaintained a high-level productivity based on efficient use of<br />\nwork time, thereby augmenting<br />\nleisure time, and by positive<br />\nrather than aversive control<br />\nmethods, including self-selection of work tasks and hours,<br />\nwithin the limitations based on<br />\ncommunity needs. The effectiveness of such methods has<br />\nbeen demonstrated, with some<br />\nmodifications, at Twin Oaks, a<br />\nSkinnerian commune in Virginia,<br />\nand on a smaller degree within a<br />\npsychology laboratory on the<br />\nHopkins campus.<br /><br />\nPredictably,<br />\nSkinner's<br />\ncommunity was attacked for<br />\ndenying individual freedom. He<br />\ncountered in his debate with<br />\nCarl Rogers, that 1) all behavior<br />\nis controlled in either a systematic or unsystematic way; 2)<br />\nthat systematic control produces<br />\nefficiency, thereby enhancing<br />\nleisure; and that 3) the visibility<br />\nof control can increase the<br />\nprobability of counter-control.<br />\nAs the authority controls those<br />\nbeneath her/him, the authority<br />\nis controlled by the behavior of<br />\nthose under authority.<br />\nSkinner's attention turned<br />\nto a more formal analysis of<br />\nsocial institutions in 1953 with<br />\nthe publication of Science and<br />\nHuman Behavior, which discussed the roles of government,<br />\nreligion, economic structures<br />\nand education. His basic complaint was that most social<br />\ninstitutions used aversive coercion rather than positive incentive to maintain productivity.<br />\nHis own \u201eingenious work he<br />\nattributed to leisure time to play<br />\nwith ideas as opposed to work,<br />\nwhich he found to be culturally<br />\ndefined as productivity to avoid<br />\nfrequently arbitrary punishment.<br /><br />\n'letters to the editor'<br />\nLAW<br /><br />\nFraternal Living<br />\nIn the next several weeks, many young men who<br />\nhappen to be Hopkins students will decide whether to join<br />\na fraternity. Perhaps they will find it difficult - considering<br />\nthat they are freshmen who can hardly be expected to<br />\nknow enough to make a choice that will affect the next<br />\nthree years of their lives.<br />\nMost people identify closely with their families from<br />\nthe time they are small children until the time they finish<br />\nhigh school. When they get to Hopkins, they are assigned<br />\nto the dorms, which usually provide a definite community<br />\nat<br />\nHowever, in their second year, Hopkins students are<br />\nforced to fend for themselves in the outside world. Some<br />\nhave friends with whom they can set up housekeeping;<br />\nSome do not. Most will end up experiencing some degree<br />\nof alienation.<br />\nGiven this scenario, fraternity life offers a young<br />\nperson a chance to continue as a member of a supportive<br />\ngroup. This can be valuable in cushioning a student from<br />\nthe emotional shock of life on his own. In some cases,<br />\nthough, it prevents people from maturing the way they<br />\nwould if they were independent.<br />\nThere are many different aspects to life in a fraternity.<br />\nMaturity and attitudes toward independence are perhaps<br />\nthe most important criteria freshmen should use in making<br />\ntheir decisions about rush.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to propose that<br />\nthe university consider creating a<br />\nlaw school. The physical requirements of such a school are<br />\nnot unreasonable - a library of<br />\napproximately 50,000 to start,<br />\nseveral lecture halls and classrooms, and an administrative<br />\nwing.<br />\nSuch a law school could<br />\ndraw upon faculty from the arts<br />\nand sciences, engineering and<br />\nmedical faculty of the university, as well as from SAIS, to<br />\nsupplement the regular law faculty. There could even be a six<br />\nyear B.A.-Juris Doctor or B.E.S.Juris Doctor tract similar to that<br />\noffered by the medical school.<br />\nThere is a real need for<br />\nmore accredited law schools<br />\ndespite the incorrect reports of a<br />\nsaturation of the job market for<br />\nlaw school graduates. Jobs for<br />\nlawyers are opening up in the<br />\nfields of public administration,<br />\nfinance, international trade as<br />\nwell as in the traditional areas of<br />\nlaw practice. Yet, the approximately 150 accredited law<br />\nschools are turning away thousands of highly qualified applicants for lack of space.<br />\nA Johns Hopkins University<br /><br />\nLaw Center would be a definite<br />\ncommitment to moving beyond<br />\nthe areas of science and medicine into a frontier where great<br />\nchallenges abound.<br />\nDavid Leland<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt was extremely disappointing to find the News-Letter of<br />\nFebruary 2 completely overlooked the performance of the<br />\nDuke Ellington Band in Shriver<br />\nHall on Tuesday, January 30.<br />\nWhat is altogether disheartening<br />\nis the News-Letter preferred to<br />\ndevote a half-page to the onstage effects and spectators'<br />\ncostumes comprising Heart's<br />\nshow that same night at the<br />\nCivic Center rather than cover<br />\nthis world-famous big-band that<br />\nmany jazz experts consider to<br />\nhave had the greatest influence<br />\non this type of music.<br />\nFor those completely unfamiliar with jazz names, Duke<br />\nEllington was the prolific writer<br />\nand arranger immortalized in<br />\nStevie Wonder's \"Sir Duke,\" and<br />\nranks with, if not above, Count<br />\nBasic and Bennie Goodman as<br />\nthe great leaders of big bands.<br />\nThe core of a big band consists<br />\nof five saxes (two alto, two<br /><br />\ntenor, one baritone), three to<br />\nfive trombones, three to five<br />\ntrumpets and rhythm (piano,<br />\nVariations<br />\nbass, drum set).<br />\nabound, often corresponding to<br />\nthe band leader's taste, e.g.<br />\nMaynard Ferguson's brass section is invariably strongest, even<br />\nwithout him.

It is<br />\nreminiscent of the bliss experienced by Moses<br />\nafter he chomped his jaws down on a Polish<br />\nsausage atop Mount Sinai. No golden calf ever<br />\nhad it so good. Sleaze is an embalmed penis<br />\non a kaiser roll, a kiss on the lips from Bella<br />\nAbzug, the leftovers of a head cheese casserole.<br />\nThe individual who is enlightened by such divine<br />\ndecadence becomes instantly immune to all evil<br />\nand all good, in addition to receiving low sub<br />\nscription rates to any number of approved<br />\nreligious publications.<br /><br />\nA Note on the History<br />\nMuch of the text in this article has been<br />\ntaken from a little known scripture, commonly<br />\ncalled The Book of Cysts, which has been in<br />\nexistence for nearly 2500 years. It is amended<br />\nand annotated every year by a tiny religious cult<br />\nin the Appalachians called The Society of Bland<br />\nCatatonics. This clandestine society lives together under the most austere conditions. They<br />\nare extremely pious and \u2022hold fast to their<br />\nprinciples. They vow:<br />\n1)never to swallow any food<br />\n2) never to speak while talking<br />\n3) never to pay their rent on time<br />\n4) never to change their underwear<br />\n5) never to shop in Bloomingdales<br />\n6) never to breathe on Mondays<br />\n7) never to giggle while masturbating<br />\n8) never to polish their silverware<br />\n9) never to clone their inlaws<br />\n10) never to go to the bathroom<br />\nOne of the most revered Catatonics, Hypodermicus, describes his group's philosophy:<br />\n\"Man is by nature a celestial immigrant, he<br />\nthinks too much and wears dull ties.\"<br /><br />\nokneAzca eude<br /><br />\nTHE OFFK<br />\nTO SI,EA'A<br /><br />\nby Marc N<br />\n10) But it is written that the Lord consumed<br />\na few too many beers that day and , prankster<br />\nthat he was, decided to create other living<br />\ncreatures to cohabit the Earth with Binkey.<br />\n11) And the Boss bellowed: \"Binkey, thou<br />\nart excessively laid-back and mellow. Thou<br />\nwouldst look better with a small head and a<br />\nbrain to match.\"<br />\n12) Binkcy raiseth an eyebrow and exclaimeth: \"Dot thou think me some kind of fool?\"<br />\nBut before Binkey had finished his question, the<br />\nBig G dash D broke into song:<br />\n\"Well I know I ain't good lookin' baby.<br />\nAnd I smell like kerosene'<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWell I know I ain't good lookin' baby,<br />\nAnd I smell like Kerosene;<br />\nBut honey, when 1 get through with you<br />\nYou gonna know 1 say what I mean.\"<br />\n13) And without another measure, or even a<br />\nrefrain, the Champ exposed his Gentleman to<br />\nthe ignorant child and moldeth his head into the<br />\nshape of a pin, and he caused all of Binkey's hair<br />\nto fall from his scalp, except for a small tuft at<br />\nthe point, and the Champ tied a pink ribbon on<br />\nthe remaining lock of hair.<br />\n14) And Binkey the Pinhead bowed his head<br />\nin submission while his master bursteth into<br />\nhysterics.<br /><br />\nCheesecake photos by Harris<br />\nlast twenty years: another scroll dating back to<br />\nthe time of Christ. Deciphering the text was<br />\nnearly impossible, as the scientists discovered<br />\nthat the parchment on which the Scripture was<br />\nwritten had been encrusted with petrified feces;<br />\nthis led to the belief that the scroll had been<br />\nused by several generations as toilet paper, even<br />\nthough no toilets, to this date, have been unearthed. The cleaned-up manuscript revealed to<br />\nthe world an astonishing piece of history. It<br />\nseems as though the Virgin Mary was not quite<br />\nso chaste as she would have everyone believe.<br />\nThere was a real Virgin Mary, however. For that<br />\nmatter, there were probably thousands of Marys<br />\nwalking around with their hymens intact, but<br />\nthat is not the point.

Note the similarity of<br />\nthe two words. Linguists are certain that the<br />\nword geek was first coined by Aristotle, who<br />\nmay have been one himself. In American slang<br />\nthe word literally refers to a person who works<br />\nin carnival sideshows, whose principal act consists of biting the heads off of live chickens and<br />\nsnakes. Historically, before the Olympian games<br />\ncould begin, the people of Athens were required<br />\nto drag Aristotle by his feet twice around the<br />\ncity and then over to the playing area, where the<br />\nbleeding scholar would perform the gruesome<br />\nritual while being tickled by naked eunuchs.<br />\nAfter the ritual, the leaders of Athens would<br />\nencircle the twitching maniac and question him<br />\nas to the significance of his bizarre act, to which<br />\nAristotle would respond by 'moving his eyes<br />\nfrom one side to the other, repeating over and<br />\nover: \"Geek! Geek!\"<br />\nB.The Great Paternity Suit.

When<br />\nasked by the priests why it took so many times<br />\nbefore she got pregnant, the Madonna replied:<br />\n\"I don't know, He could never seem to get it UP.<br />\nHe was always thinking about baseball.\" The<br />\npriests found the Lord guilty and ordered him to<br />\npay child support indefinitely. The Lord became<br />\npurturbcd by the verdict and terminated the<br />\npregnancy, muttering: \"Those damn lawyers!<br />\nYou give them an arm and a leg and what do<br />\nthey do?

Something about Valentine's Day has always<br />\nrubbed me the wrong way. I've been thinking about it<br />\nthe past few days, concluding that what we have here is<br />\nthe most paltry, ridiculous, and malicious holiday ever<br />\nconcocted. So with full awareness of the controversy<br />\nthat may result, I would wish to propose that Valentine's Day be abolished.<br />\nJanis Ian wasn't joking when she whined about \"the<br />\nvalentines that never came.\" Not getting valentines can<br />\nhurt; getting them can cause tragic repurcussions as well.<br />\nIn the seventh grade, I had a crush on a girl named Mary<br />\nEileen Langendorfenfelder who had the most fantastic<br />\noverbite I've ever seen. She was a quiet, diffident girl<br />\nwith one or maybe two friends. She had wide hazel eyes<br />\nand a voice as soft as velvet. For months we had been<br />\nsneaking surreptitious glances at each other during class,<br />\nbut we never spoke. (This, incidentally, was the approach I used on females until last October.) With<br />\nValentine's Day a week away, I decided to send her a<br />\nhandmade card with a heart and my name on it.<br />\nWhen the big day arrived and Sister Atilla began<br />\nhanding out the valentines, my heart started pounding<br />\nlouder than the drum solo in \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.\" I<br />\nfixed my eyes on Mary Eileen, waiting for her reaction<br />\nas she opened my card. Somehow I envisioned a Clairol<br />\ncommercial, with her reading the valentine and then<br />\nrunning across the room in slow motion, her arms<br />\nreaching for me, her long tresses bouncing on her shoulder. Finally, and so slowly, she took the cardifrom the<br />\nenvelope and read it. Her head jerked up abruptly and<br />\nshe looked at me with her jaw almost touching the St.<br />\nTheresa medal that hung from her neck. I smiled at her,<br />\nbut she turned away, a tough, triumphant, nearly vicious<br />\ngrin growing on her face. She never looked at me again.<br />\nThe next day, and every day after that, she came to<br />\nschool with her skirt raised a few dramatic inches, a<br />\ntouch of rouge on her cheeks, and her blouse revealing<br />\nfor the first time some pubescent cleavage. The loud<br />\ngum-gnawing Lolitas of the class became her mates. In a<br />\nfew weeks' time, she bagged the captain of the boys'<br />\nbasketball team. With that lonesome little handmade<br />\ncard, I created a monster. I turned a sweet demure lass<br />\ninto a painted courtesan. I (or rather, my valentine)<br />\nshowed her that she was indeed attractive to males.<br />\nOvernight she attained an awesome amount of self-confidence, and chose to go after bigger and better<br />\ngame than I seemed to promise. For months afterward<br />\nI fantasized about going to Mary Eileen's house.

She thought the speaking in tongues<br />\nwas strange and that the class was a money gimmick.<br />\nThe Way members had not told her exactly how much<br />\nthe class would cost, but insisted that it was worth the<br />\nprice. After being pursued by Way Fellowship members<br />\nwho had only met her once before, she felt they cared<br />\nlcss about her as a person than about making her take<br />\nthe _class. This student was not convinced by a movie<br />\nentitled Changed. an introduction to The Way showing<br /><br />\nby Patrick Ercolano<br /><br />\ntwisted dream of mine, she would open the front door<br />\nand I would pause long and balefully, entrancing her<br />\nwith my steely gaze. Then, with a cigarette dangling<br />\nfrom my lips, I'd mutter, \"Your loss, sugar,\" and drill<br />\nher with a slug from my .45 .<br />\nHad it not<br />\nbeen for Va'lentine's Day, I probably would have been<br />\nspared some torturous phantasms.<br />\nThe confusion surrounding the identity of St.<br />\nValentine is another valid reason to do away with \"the<br />\nlover's holiday.\" Does anyone actually know or care<br />\nwho the guy was? Allegedly, there were two St. Valentines, both of whom lived around A.D. 270. They were<br />\ncanonized for some minor good deeds - they had converted some lepers to Christianity, loaned some people a<br />\ncouple bucks, whatever. If such lax standards applied<br />\ntoday, every person who tossed a quarter to a Bowery<br />\nbum would be up for sainthood. Moreover, my trusty<br />\nHenry W. Jenkins Funeral Service calendar lists February<br />\n14 as the feast day of Saints Cyril and Methodius.<br />\nThere's no mention whatsoever of any \"St. Valentine.\"<br />\nPersonally, I think this Valentine guy was probably some<br />\nhuchster on the make for some publicity gratis. It may<br />\nnot be a bad idea to write letters to the Vatican calling<br />\nfor an investigation.<br /><br />\nA Valentine's Day custom in Utah decrees that each<br /><br />\nyoung women epoxy her head to her beloved's chest,<br /><br />\nWhat kind of holiday is Valentine's Day after all?<br />\nNo one gets off work, schools stay open, parking<br />\nmeters must be fed. To use a popular collegiate word,<br />\nit's bogus. Madison Avenue has us thinking \"holiday\" so we go out and buy the greeting cards, the<br />\nflowers, and the candy. And what about the popular<br />\n(and, I would add, totally erroneous) conception<br />\nof the heart'? You don't have to be a pre-med to<br />\nknow what a heart really looks like. It's not twicerounded at the top and pointed at the bottom. The<br />\nidea! Next to Disco Nite, a beating heart has to be<br />\none of the most repulsive sights anyone would care to<br />\nsee. It has numerous tubes and veins going into it, out<br />\nof it, through it, around it. Each year millions of<br />\nschoolchildren receive the shock of a lifetime when<br />\nthey finally discover the heart's true appearance.<br />\nSuch a powerful jolt of reality at an early age leaves<br />\nemotional scars and builds future distrust of adults.<br />\nThis is no laughing matter.<br />\nI have dredged up some international Valentine's<br />\nDay customs which are so farcical as to cause even<br />\nthe staunchest pro-Valentinean to think twice. In<br />\nSicily, young unmarried women rise before dawn and<br />\nstand by their windows. Each girl believes that the<br /><br />\nfirst man she sees will become her bridegroom within<br />\nthe year. This should tell you something about<br />\nSicilian women. Odds are that the first man who<br />\ncomes along is involved in linen supplies and cement<br />\novershoes, and has little interest in superstitious<br />\nguineas.<br />\nOn the eve of Valentine's Day, unmarried English<br />\ngirls pin bay leaves to their pillows. According to this<br />\ncustom, each girl will see her future husband in her<br />\ndreams. What usually happens, however, is that she<br />\nwakes up with her mouth and ears full of bay leaves.<br />\nA bad start like this is sure to put a crimp in one's<br />\nfestive valentine mood.<br />\nScandanavian tradation dictates that on February<br />\n14 each unwed girl should strike her forehead with a<br />\nfolded rose petal. If the petal cracks, then the girl<br />\nknows that her valentine loves her. If her forehead<br />\ncracks, then she knows that she'd best forget about<br />\nvalentines for a while.<br />\nThose are some of the more staid Valentaine's<br />\nDay customs. To prevent the pathetic spinsters<br />\nof the world from making total ninnies of themselves<br />\nwith these inane rituals, this so-called \"holiday\" must<br />\nbe put away in a safe place where it won't harm<br />\nanybody.<br />\nHow, you might ask, can this be done? Beats me.<br />\nI've considered skipping the date completely,jumping<br />\nfrom February 13th right to the 15th. But that idea<br />\nisn't too plausible in the long run. Not many people<br />\ncan sleep for 24 hours straight, or would want to. As<br />\nit is, there's barely enough time to do all our numerous chores and duties anyway. Therefore, those of us<br />\nwho love to hate Valentine's Day are forced to find<br />\nanother excuse to celebrate the date (since no one<br />\nlikes to get left out of a party). Being an avid baseball<br />\nfan, I have spent the last few February 14ths paying<br />\nsilent homage to a young outfielder for the Montreal<br />\nExpos named Ellis Valentine. The man has a rifle arm<br />\nthat is worthy of one day of celebration, at least by a<br />\nbaseball nut; and this way I get to observe \"Valentine's Day\" without worrying about cards and flowers<br />\nand noxious little \"heart-shaped\" candy that has<br />\n\"Luv Ya\" etched on top.<br />\nConspicuously and happily absent from this past<br />\nWednesday's newscasts were reports of young ladies<br />\nwho had split their noggins with folded rose petals or<br />\nwoken with bay leaves on their teeth. Good thing,<br />\nbecause if I had run across any such cases, I would<br />\nhave been very stingy with sympathy. In fact, I really<br />\nwouldn't have cared. I was too busy hoping that<br />\nEllis Valentine, wherever he might have been, was<br />\nenjoying his day.<br /><br />\nhow the PFAL class has altered certain people's lives.<br />\nShe felt the case histories shown in the movie were<br />\nextreme.<br />\nAnother student had more objections. She thinks<br />\nthe group was exploitive in its \"focus on a few individuals they feel might have emotional doubts and taking<br />\nadvantage of a weakness not to turn them down.\" She<br />\nalso said that \"while getting a new person is an ego trip,<br />\nthe organization as a whole is money-conscious.\" The<br />\nrelationship between members' and Wierwille, founder of<br />\nThe Way ministry and its \"star\" according to one<br />\nstudent in the film about the group, is one of blind<br />\ndevotion.<br />\nThe Christian Fellowship on campus, a division of<br />\nthe Intervarsity Christian Fellowship, has discussed what<br />\nit believes to be reasons for The Way's lack of popularity. According to some of the Fellowship organizers,<br />\nan abundant and powerful life may not appeal to Hopkins students as much as to other people because they<br /><br />\nare on the whole well off. In other words,\"They have an<br />\nabundant life already.\" They also suggested that The<br />\nWay's policy of denying the .deity of Christ would turn<br />\naway the majority of Christians who believe that Christ<br />\nis God.<br />\nThough The Way continues trying to attract interest<br />\nat Hopkins, it has not been able to become firmly<br />\nestablished on campus.

Each<br />\nfamily member loves and respects the<br />\nothers while remaining absorbed in his<br />\nown world.<br />\nThe inevitable conflict arises when<br />\nthe family collides head-on with the real<br />\nworld of business, etiquette, and indigestion. Essie's sister, Alice (the only \"normal\" one in the family), falls in love with<br />\nthe boss' son, Tony Kirby. The two<br />\nfamilies must meet. Convinced that his<br />\nfamily should see the Sycamores as they<br />\nreally are, Tony brings his parents to<br />\ndinner at the Sycamores' one night earlier<br />\nthan had been planned - and bedlam<br />\nensues. Not only does the family cheerfully and relentlessly pursue its eccentricities, but G-men arrest the entire household and guests for Communist subversion. The morning after, Grandpa salvages<br />\nthe marriage by convincing Tony's father<br />\nthat \"you can't take it with you\" and<br />\nthat enjoyable occupations are the only<br />\nones worth pursuing.<br />\nBy its very nature, You Can't Take It<br /><br />\nWith You is an ensemble play whose<br />\nsuccess hinges on the integrated spontaneity of its players. This is why Center<br />\nStage is an ideal company to produce it.<br />\nWith the recent exception of The G.R.<br />\nPoint's Michael Moriarity, Center Stage<br />\ndoes not feature big-name box office<br />\nstars; rather, it attracts good character<br />\nactors with broad theatrical experience<br />\nfrom Broadway to summer stock. The<br />\ncompany also features its regulars; Daniel<br />\nSzelag (Ed), Vivienne Shub (Gay Wellington and the Grand Duchess Olga), and<br />\nRichard Malone (G-man) have appeared<br />\nin plays earlier this season.<br />\nAs usual, Center Stage's production<br />\noffers good individual performances.<br />\nHeading the cast, Robert Donley (Martin<br />\nVanderhof), plays the eccentric, but sage<br />\npatriarch providing a two-way telescope<br />\nconnecting his family with the Kirbys and<br />\nallowing each to see the other's point of<br />\nview. Paul and Penny (Richard Dix and<br />\nMary Hara) and Ed and Essie (Daniel<br />\nSzelag and Cynthia Crumlish) are two<br />\ngenerations of the same loving, lovable,<br />\nself-absorbed couple. Mr. and Mrs. Kirby<br />\n(Bob Horen and Roberta Lund) make a<br />\nprim-and-proper social pair,interesting to<br />\nthe audience for their spark of willfullness and whimsy not far from the surface.<br />\nAlice (Lizbeth Mackay) and Tony (Michael Gross), the romantic leads, are less<br />\nsatisfying than the others - perhaps<br />\nbecause they are too normal. Alice is<br />\nplayed rather shrilly; it is hard to believe<br />\nthat she really loves her family rather,<br />\nthan tolerates it. Tony, who sould be a<br />\nlittle more reserved coming from an<br />\nupper crust background, comes across<br />\nlike Steve Martin's \"wild and crazy guy.\"<br />\nVivien Shub (Olga) and Michael McCarty<br />\n(Kolenkhov) offer humorous, touching<br />\nminor roles.<br />\nYou Can't Take It With You is, at once,<br />\nthe prototype and the parody of modern<br /><br />\nPretty Baby: A Film<br />\nOf Ambivalence<br />\nWhen Pretty. Baby came out in 1977,<br />\nit received mixed reviews. Some critics<br />\nconsidered it one of the most beautiful<br />\nand artistic films ever released, claiming<br />\nthat director Louis Malle had taken a<br />\nhitherto taboo and treated it in an<br />\nimaginative and compassionate manner.<br />\nOthers denounced it 'as an exploitative<br />\npicture--one that used the extremely<br />\ntouchy subject of child prostitution for<br />\npurely capitalistic ends. This was merely<br />\n\"sexploitation\" in a different guise;<br />\nperhaps not as blatent as Charlie's Angels,<br />\nbut with the same idea in mind. That the<br />\nstory was only partly factual added even<br />\nmore fuel to the fire; some critics declared it to be an attempt to take a single<br />\nfootnote of history and sensationalize it<br />\nin order to cater to mass appeal. Between<br />\nthese two extremes was a surprisingly<br /><br />\nlimited body of opinion, for this was<br />\nmovie that few could feel ambivalent<br />\ntowards. However, Pretty Baby is basically an ambivalent movie. Like a great<br />\nnumber of films, it has both strong points<br />\nand defects; in the long run,it boils down<br />\nto a matter of personal preference.<br />\nPretty Baby is set in New Orleans in.<br />\na place called Storyville, the city's redlight district. The plot centers on the<br />\ndevelopment of Violet, the daughter of a<br />\nprostitute who is herself \"learning\" the<br />\ntrade. In a sense, we see the goings-on<br />\nwithin the house through her eyes. The<br />\ncamera perspective and the action seem<br />\nto be centered around Violet and her<br />\nview of the other prostitutes and male<br />\ncustomers.<br />\nA second story line consists of the<br />\nrelationship between Violet and E.J.<br />\nBellocq (Keith Carradine), a photographer who has been assigned to produce<br />\na pictorial essay on the prostitutes.<br />\nInitially disgusted with the goings-on, he<br />\nbegins to take an interest in Violet which<br />\nturns into full-blown romantic love. The<br />\nfilm never fully resolves why his affection<br />\nturns from paternal to romantic\u2014the<br />\nviewer is simply forced to accept the fact.<br />\nThis highlights what is perhaps the<br />\nfundamental weakness in the film; the<br />\nplot is not always fully developed. It lags<br />\nin several spots, and probably could have<br />\nended with greater effect. However, the<br />\nfault in this case does not lie with either<br />\nthe director or the actors, but with the<br />\nscreenwriter. More could have been done<br />\nwith the available material, and the<br />\nCont. on p. 16<br /><br />\ndv,<br /><br />\nYOU<br />\nCAN'T<br />\nTAKE IT<br />\nWITH YOU<br />\nKAUFMAN AND HART<br />\ntelevision's situation comedy. It is especially reminiscent of Saturday Night<br />\nLive's Norman Lear satire of a Pittsburgh<br />\nsnake-handling family which includes a<br />\nnun, a homosexual state police officer, a<br />\nunion boss husband, and his white-collar<br />\nexecutive wife. But the weaknesses which<br />\nSaturday Night parodies is the strength of<br />\nKaufman and Hart's play: modern<br />\nsit-corns exploit eccentric characters<br />\nmerely for shock value; You Can't<br />\nTake It With You uses them to embellish<br /><br />\nits theme and contribute to the overall<br />\ncomic effect. In other words, if the<br />\nSaturday Night family were not snake<br />\nhandlers, they would become a part of<br />\nnormal society - and cease to be different<br />\nand itneresting. Strip Kaufman and Hart's<br />\ncharacters of an eccentricity or two, and<br />\nthey remain integral parts of a family<br />\nwhich does not accept the norms of<br />\nsociety - a family that has learned to<br />\nenjoy life.<br />\n\u2014Ros Resnick<br /><br />\nSteve<br />\nRandall's<br />\nContrary to what you may have read<br />\nelsewhere, the forthcoming Sex Pistols'<br />\nLP, The Great Rock 'n'Roll Swindle, was<br />\nnot recorded live during their American<br />\ntour last January.

He<br />\ncame to grips with his homosexuality, but<br />\nas the film begins he is again confronted<br />\nwith a dilemna, this time in the form of<br />\nhis inclination to dress in women's<br />\nclothing. In the gay culture, it seems, a<br />\ndrag queen is considered below the<br />\n\"straight\" gay. At the hair salon where<br />\nRobin works, his gay employer acknowledges the primary function is to make<br />\nwomen look and feel beautiful, but he<br />\ndoesn't want drag queens working in his<br />\nshop. When a customer discovers Robin's<br />\nstatus in the gay world, the employer<br />\nimmediately fires him.<br />\nThis is the cue for Robin to pursue a<br />\ncareer as a female impersonator, something he had been dabbling with,but was<br />\nstill unsure about. Gradually, he perfects<br />\nhis talent for impersonating the great<br />\nwomen of the silver screen, and by the<br />\nend of the film he has transcended the<br />\nlabel of drag queen and gives a dazzling<br />\nperformance of Channing, Dietrich, Garland among others in a respectable New<br />\nYork club.<br /><br />\nLiza (Hollis Mc Lauren) is a schizophrenic who has spent eight years in a<br />\nmental hospital. In her opening shot, she<br />\nis running through the streets of Toronto<br />\nin her robe and slippers, escaping from<br />\nthe hospital. She turns to Robin, her only<br />\nfriend. Liza moves in and attempts to<br />\novercome her mental condition. She<br />\nalways carries a large scrapbook in which<br />\nshe collects her thoughts and feelings.<br />\nWhen a friend in publishing reads her<br />\nwriting, she insists there is potential for<br />\nLiza's poetry and fiction. Liza is supportive of Robin's career, and he, M turn, of<br />\nher sturggle to make it in the world<br />\nwithout hospitals, without treatment,<br />\nwithout drugs. Liza gets her pills con-fused, though, and gets pregnant, a risk<br />\nher doctor says is dangerous in her<br />\ncondition. She survives the pregnancy,<br />\nand by the end of the film, although she<br />\nstill hallucinates and needs treatment,<br />\nshe has realized the simple fact that she is<br />\nalive and can function outside a mental<br />\nhospital.<br />\nIf Outrageous had been made in<br />\nHollywood (it is Canadian), this tender<br />\nfilm would be a melodramatic tearjerker.<br />\nBut the treatment by director Richard<br />\nBenner is realistic and precise. A combination of a drag queen and a schizophrenic is odd, but Benner doesn't exploit this<br />\nfeature by creating stereotypes. Robin<br />\nand Liza are not approximations, but<br />\nbold and convincing characters. Robin's<br />\nrise to stardom probably parallels in<br /><br />\nmany ways that of Craig Russell, whose<br />\nperformance both as himself and especially as the females he impersonates is<br />\nbrilliant. Liza's moments of hallucination<br />\nand hysteria are frightening, and she<br />\nsustains a sense of her mental illness<br />\nthroughout the film. The visual style and<br />\ncinematography of Outragious is its<br />\nweakest point, probably because director<br />\nBenner was more concerned with the<br />\naccurate portrayal of his characters and<br />\ntheir struggle.<br />\nOne of the most interesting aspects<br />\nof the film is the insight it gives into a<br />\nsub-culture never seen by most of the<br />\npopulation: the gay bar. The scenes in a<br />\nbar in Toronto and in the much tougher<br />\nlooking Jack Rabbit Club in New York<br />\nwere not exploited as glimpses of decadence by the straight world; they are<br />\nportrayed with restraint and taste. The<br />\nscenes within the gay bars are interesting,<br />\nnot because they appeal to our baser<br />\ninstincts or lewd imaginations, but<br />\nbecause they show us something we<br />\nrarely if ever see.<br />\nOutrageous sets itself up to make<br />\nunfair judgements and gross generalizations as to the nature of the relationship<br />\nbetween society and the world of the<br />\nsocial misfit. \"crazies,\" and he can't<br />\nUnderstand why the world spoils special<br />\n.i)eople as he implores her to be dazzling.<br />\nLiza herself is always crying out against<br />\nher mother who wants her back in the<br />\nwhite padded cell, and the psychologist<br /><br />\nTrash Fits The Bill<br />\n. Trash has one thing going for it -- it<br />\nwas appropriately named. Andy Warhol's<br />\n1971 expose of a junkie living in a<br />\nperpetual hippie's dream near New York's<br />\nFillmore Theatre is exactly what it is<br />\nlabeled: trash.<br />\nIn keeping with other Warhol films,<br />\nthere is as little \"plot\" as possible. The<br />\nspontaneity of the dialogue is also proof<br />\nthat no script was used. It is often difficult to decide whether Warhol pur-<br /><br />\nposely used one camera to give Trash a all rich or straight people as shockingly<br />\ndocumentary look, or if he didn't have dumb. Trash attempts to make the<br />\nenough money to hire a second camera- audience feel any emotional impact<br />\nman. In other words, Trash looks like a whatsoever -- be it shock or simply the<br />\nfilm with little effort, money or skill laughs which accompany, any flop of a<br />\nbehind it.<br />\nmovie -- are all unsuccessful. Trash is as<br />\nTo make matters worse, Warhol tries impotent as the junkie it tries to describe.<br />\ndesperately to be shocking. There are<br />\nAll of the women in Trash wear an<br />\noverdrawn needle-in-arm drug scenes, overall white face make-up which covers<br />\nrape scenes, impotency scenes, mastur- their skin. These sickly creatures of<br />\nbation scenes and a general portrayal of Warhol's misplaced nightmare would<br />\nprobably be more comfortable in a circus<br />\nTITLE<br />\nMANUFACTURER<br />\nNO.<br />\nfreak show than in a movie.

Young<br />\nMr. Forbert has produced an impressive<br />\nand very enjoyable debut album, Alive on<br />\nArrival(Nemperor/CBS).<br />\nForbert's lead vocals, guitar, and<br />\nharmonica are sparingly accented by top<br />\nsession sidemen Steve Burgh and Hugh<br />\nMcDonald (David Bromberg) along with<br />\nace saxophonist David Sanborn (Born to<br />\nRun) among others. The lean sound<br />\nshowcases the songs themselves, alternatively easygoing or passionate without<br />\nlapsing into\"mellow\" or hysteria. The<br />\ntunes have a clean, honest shine to them,<br />\na grinning, toe-tapping recklessness.<br />\nconfidently refuses the false<br />\nArrival<br />\nrefuge of lush production overkill, a<br />\npitfall that claimed recent releases from<br />\nCat Stevens, Elton John and Billy Joel,<br />\nthe aging pop giants of the genre.<br />\nForbert arrives without pretensions,<br />\nbut full of ambition. Poetry, humor,<br />\npathos; words and music, this boy wants<br />\nit all. His approach is simple and effective.<br />\nMany of the lyrics are autobiographical accounts of a Southern boy<br />\ncome to the big city to play his music,<br />\na 70's Johnny B. Goode. Forbert, a<br />\nMississippi kid, captures both the newcomer's bemused wonder (Grand Central<br />\nStation, March 18,1977 and Big City Cat)<br />\nand its flip side, a battered loneliness<br />\n(Tonight I Feel so Far Away From<br />\nHome). The album's best cut, \"Steve<br />\nForbert's Midsummer Night's Toast\",<br />\nunites both perspectives in a portrait of a<br />\nGreenwich Village poet:<br />\n\"I've been living and breathing in the<br />\nrat trap town,<br />\nTrying to get over where the wall<br />\nbreaks down,<br />\nHolding my head up with illy thin,<br />\ntired arms<br />\nAnd all my rainbow dreams'.\"<br />\nForbert's insistent rasping voice<br />\nworks well on these hard edged songs, as<br />\nwell as on the revved up rocker \"You<br />\nCannot Win If You Do Not Play\", but<br />\nbegins to grate on the more gentle ballads. Of these, the nebulous \"It Isn't<br />\nGonna Be That Way\" is a lyrical low<br />\npoint, but \"Settle Down\" charms easily<br />\nand \"Thinldn\" is a Spring sentiment that<br />\nwill melt the frost off your Charm City<br />\nwin dowpan es.<br />\nCont. on p. 16<br /><br />\nPAGE 16 / FEBRUARY 16, 1979<br /><br />\nPretty Baby<br />\nCont. from p. 14<br />\nstory could have been handled in a more<br />\ninteresting and perceptive way.<br />\nStill, the plot structure does not<br />\nseem to be Louis Malle's primary interest.<br />\nIt is an overall impression we are presented with, less a story than a picture,<br />\nand a beautiful picture at that. The<br />\ncamera seems intent upon capturing every<br />\ndetail and offering the viewer a panoramic vision. The perspective is vital to<br />\nthe message conveyel, as is the quality<br />\nand the texture of the picture itself. The<br />\nuse of light and darkness, the blurry,<br />\ndream-like quality and the sophisticated<br />\ncamera movements add something to<br />\nPretty Baby which few other movies<br />\npossess.<br />\nFor the photography alone, Pretty<br />\nBaby is well worth seeing. The acting is<br />\nnot superb, but it is good enough. The<br />\nthematic development could also withstand' critical censure, and the film is<br />\ndefinitely not exploitative.

The other<br />\nsabremen John Loonsk and<br />\nMike Schwerin, were 1-0 and 0-2<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nAgainst UMBC, Hopkins<br />\nregulars were sidelined as Coach<br />\nOles decided to give the meet to<br />\nhis subs to win or lose. The<br />\nresponse this time was overwhelming.<br />\nSabremen<br />\nMike<br />\nSchwerin, John Loonsk and Jim<br />\nFowler went 1-2, 3-0 and 2-1<br />\nrespectively. The epeemen didn't<br />\nfare quite so \u2022 well; John Osby<br /><br />\nwas 1-2 , Dave Nover 2-1 and<br />\nJames Newman 2-1 but on the<br />\nfoil team Dave Meyer and Kevin<br />\nGranville were undefeated and<br />\nMarco Parillo was 2-1.

The Quizmaster is<br />\nback, and that's a fact! I've got a brainbuster that oughta set all<br />\nyou little quizlings reelin'! It's our se m i-a nnual Film Clip<br />\nContest! Check out the clipped classics below, and simply send<br />\nin the title of each flick, plus the names of the actors in each<br />\nfilm. It's easy. Maybe too easy, you say? Don't worry, kids. We'll<br />\njust take all the winning entries and have a drawing. Everybody<br />\nhas a chance! This is America, son.<br />\nPer usual, send your entries to Box 1230 or transport them<br />\nto the grand old Gatehouse by 5 p.m. Wednesday.(And don't<br />\nfor a minute buy this bull about my going to Key West last<br />\nweek. Those two \"quizmistress\" babes slipped me a mickie, and<br />\nthen conveniently slapped in their quiz. You'll be glad to hear<br />\nthat they've since been nabbed and put in a women's C,ITC,tional institution.)
