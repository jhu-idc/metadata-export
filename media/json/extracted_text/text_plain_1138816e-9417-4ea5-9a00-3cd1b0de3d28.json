Now, the same<br />\nelitist philosophy that has been the guiding light of<br />\nsuch reactionary thinking has surfaced at Hopkins.<br />\nLast year a report was approved by the Academic<br />\nCouncil which would have been a beginning towards<br />\nthe alleviation of one of the nation's problems \u2014 the<br />\nmany years required for a medical education. The<br />\nso-called \"2-2-2\" program can save the aspiring<br />\nphysician two years that could be devoted to his<br />\nprofession.<br />\nAfter the Council added its stamp of approval, the<br />\nway seemed clear for the program's implementation.<br />\nBut then the doctors stepped in the way. Concern for<br />\nso-called elites at Homewood and well-rounded<br />\neducation for doctors seems a thin disguise for<br />\ntraditional medical elitism \u2014 the same sort of elitism<br />\nthat caused friction over former Dean Rogers'<br />\ncommunity concern, or causes medical school<br />\nenrollment to be so strictly limited. An attitude of \"I<br />\nwent through it, so they can too\" seems to prevail and<br />\nstand in the way of meaningful progress. A<br />\nreceptiveness for change on the part of the medical<br />\nschool faculty is going to be necessary before the<br />\napparent backslide at East Baltimore can be checked<br />\nand replaced by the \"rhythm of achievement\" that<br />\nPresident Muller has promised us.<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nPart of the Solution<br />\nIn our last article on \"Competition,\"<br />\npublished here in December, we decried<br />\nsome of the destructive aspects of the<br />\ncompetitive system characteristic of<br />\nHopkins. Competition is dehumanizing to<br />\nall those who participate in it, causing<br />\nthem to become insensitive to the real<br />\npurpose of education. We said that the<br />\nmost important function of education is<br />\nto teach men to serve the benefit of all.<br />\nAll sight of this function is lost when<br />\nsuccessful participation in the<br />\ncompetitive system becomes an end in<br />\nitself. University education, when based<br />\nupon the premise of competitive conflict,<br />\nbecomes an integral part of the<br />\nsel f-perperpe t rating socializing<br />\nmechanism which forces men to lose<br />\ntheir concern for real human needs.<br />\nHaving become blind to the humanness<br />\nof others, we ultimately lose our 'own<br />\nhumanity. In an increasingly<br />\nself-degrading process, continuous<br />\nparticipation in this system, without<br />\nconcern for anything but our specific role<br />\nin it, cau%es us to assume cobot-like<br />\nc)tia)t)cs. We automaticany Nigh) to<br />\naccept the reason and rationale of<br />\ncompetition, in an almost pevlovian<br />\nresponse. Without questioning the<br />\nsignificance of our individual roles,<br />\nacceptance of the dehumanizing agents of<br />\nAmerican society (eg-hydrogen bombs, a<br />\nwar-based economy, poverty in the midst<br />\nof riches, etc.) remains an undeniable<br />\npossibility. In ignoring individuality, the<br />\nfoundation of our moral bankruptcy and<br />\npsychological insecurity is laid. We who<br />\nare trained by American educational<br />\ninstitutions are potentially given the<br />\nmeans to transcend this destructive<br />\ncompetitive system. Failing to act<br />\nproductively toward that end with our<br />\nnew found awareness induces in us a<br />\nsense of guilt.<br />\nInsecurity<br />\nIndeed, it is a sign of our moral and<br />\npsychological insecurity which forces us<br />\nto compete with one another, without<br />\nregard for those we compete with or<br />\nagainst. Thus, having stated the problem,<br />\nwe can understand it. By being members<br />\nof the intellectual elite, by being<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community. we<br />\nneed not participate in destructive<br />\nconzpetition. We can understand the<br />\ninsensitivity inherent in competition, and<br />\nbegin to find solutions. This denial of the<br />\nutility of competition can only<br />\ncontribute to our security. The denial of<br />\ncompetition can satisfy our demands for<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Union<br />\n<br />\na productive development of our lives.<br />\nFinally, it ensures that no damage to the<br />\npsychological essence of our compatriots<br />\nor ourselves is done.<br />\nWhere, then, does the solution lie?<br />\nWhat is the alternative to competition?<br />\nOne solution begins with the adoption of<br />\ncooperation as the basic structure of this<br />\ncommunity within itself and in its<br />\nrelations with society.<br />\nWhy cooperation rather than<br />\ncompetition? Because cooperation is, in<br />\nthe long run, more productive for society<br />\nas a whole than is competition. While<br />\ncompetition may serve the self interest of<br />\nthose who succeed at it, in the short run,<br />\nit will be harmful to them as to society,<br />\nin the final analysis. Having \"made it,\"<br />\ntheir fight must forever after be one to<br />\ndefend their position and to defend the<br />\nsystem of competition which allowed<br />\nthem to succeed. From then on, their<br />\nactivities can no longer be directed<br />\ntowards contribution to a society which<br />\nhas permitted them success.

This is<br />\nHomewood, outwardly serene home of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins (plural John, Plural<br />\nHopkin) University, the first true<br />\nuniversity in North Baltimore, or all of<br />\nMaryland, for that matter. But behind<br />\nthis placid Georgian facade of marble and<br />\nbricks, there is panic.<br />\nHigh above the campus, in the<br />\ntop-secret Pigeon-coop room in the clock<br />\ntower of Gilman Hall, there is being held<br />\n<br />\nBarnstormers: a compelling critique<br />\nBy WARREN GULIN<br />\nThe Lion in Winter is a simplistic yet<br />\ncompelling play which owes no small part<br />\nof its appeal to the bravura performance<br />\nof Stephen Haines as Henry the 2nd.<br />\nBased on the marital strife and filial greed<br />\nof a perverse royal family, the play<br />\ndevelops from a Barmecidal feast of sorts<br />\ninto a gratifying metaphorical treat.<br />\nThroughout the play. Henry courts his<br />\nson's fiance, the royal demimondaine,<br />\n.and plots to contain his unfaithful wife<br />\nEleanor,his supercilious son, Richard. his<br />\nequally presumptuous son Geoffrey and<br />\nan adolescent lurdane named John, who<br />\nin turn conspire against the Crown and<br />\nthe Aquitaine .

It negates the<br />\ndehumanizing process of competition<br />\nwhich blindly and subtly destroys both<br />\nsociety and its individual members.<br />\nWe've pointed out what we feel is one<br />\nmuch better alternative to destructive<br />\ncompetition. Within the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, cooperation can exist, if we<br />\naccept the premise that we are all here<br />\nfor the same purpose: to acquire an<br />\neducation. Though individual demands<br />\nwith regard to education certainly may<br />\nvary, the satisfaction of each of our needs<br />\ncan only be accomplished through<br />\ncooperation amongst ourselves. With this<br />\nbasic humane attitude we can indeed help<br />\nto alleviate society's problems, and<br />\ndecide the shape of things to come.<br />\n<br />\nThe long-sought student union is closer to reality<br />\nwith the approval by the Board of Trustees and the<br />\nplanning committee of architect Donald Sickler's<br />\nflexible, attractive plans. The Hopkins Union, an<br />\naddition to Levering Hall, should be ready by<br />\nSeptember of 1973, and hopefully will help unite the<br />\nHopkins community and improve campus life. Much<br />\nof the money for the union and a renovation of<br />\nLevering Hall has already been raised. Most of the<br />\ncredit for this project should go to former president<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower. Others, too, deserve praise for<br />\nthe progress that has been made so far.<br />\nThe planning committee, which includes students,<br />\nfaculty and administration, did an admirable job in<br />\ndetermining the needs that had to be met by the<br />\nHopkins Union. Fortunately, neither the architect nor<br />\nthe planning committee have allowed themselves to be<br />\ntrapped by rigid notions about a student union. The<br />\ntwo key rooms of the addition, the looking-listening<br />\nroom and the multi-use room, seem to offer great<br />\npossibilities for growth. Even Phoebe Stanton, whose<br />\nskepticism about the University's taste is legendary,<br />\ncommented, \"The flexible design of the interior can<br />\ngenerate new uses for the rooms. Things can<br />\nspontaneously come into being.\"<br />\nWe hope students and others will contribute<br />\nsuggestions for the uses of the rooms, and that when<br />\nthe Hopkins Union is finally completed, everyone will<br />\ntake full advantage of it.<br />\n<br />\n'When I Use A Word,It Me ans Just<br />\nWhat I Choose It To Mean<br />\nNeither More Nor Less'<br />\n<br />\nEngland. the play succeeded in<br />\ntranscending, in escaping itself, offering a<br />\ntimeless message to the ambitious, the<br />\nbourgeois, the blind.

An un-tenured professor<br />\nwas sent out to the dorm snack-bar for<br />\nbacon and tomato sandwiches. Finally,it<br />\nis decided to begin phase II of the<br />\noperation. Spies, dressed as ordinary<br />\nstudents (the psychology department<br />\ndoing a splendid job in the training<br />\nprogram) were to post guard in the Book<br />\nCenter.<br />\nOur dapper old gent, disguised in<br />\npaisley bell-bottom jeans and a brown'.<br />\nand orange striped body shirt, cautiously \u2022<br />\nsteps into the bustling store.

Initial reactions to the<br />\ndisclosures were generally voices of shock<br />\nat the presence of organized subversive<br />\nactions on campus. When interviewed,<br />\none student stated, \"I don't know<br />\nanything about it. I just do my reading<br />\nand term papers and I don't get involved<br />\nin things like that.\" The hard-hitting<br />\nyellow journal, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter came out with a strong<br />\neditorial blast at Book Center<br />\nmismanagement.

The most<br />\nconstructive measure was taken by the<br />\nmembers of the Graduate Wives<br />\nAssociation who, fresh from their recent<br />\ntriumph at the Greater Chesapeake Glass<br />\nRecycling Jamboree, volunteered to<br />\nrecycle all of their husbands' books until<br />\nthe crisis is over.<br />\n<br />\nNBC's Olympics<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nSapporo, Japan\u2014NBC's day-late<br />\ncoverage of the Winter Olympics<br />\ncontinues this evening from picturesque<br />\nSapporo, an ice-locked village on the<br />\nnorthern-most island of Japan.

He does it all so<br />\nwell, and yet he makes it look so<br />\nvery easy. Gary Handleman was<br />\nnot made into an athlete, he was<br />\nborn one.<br />\nGary began his athletic career<br />\nat Lancers, a boys club in<br />\nBaltimore. He first played<br />\norganized basketball and lacrosse<br />\nthere, and while doing so, made<br />\nsome life-long friends. At the<br />\nclub he first came into contact<br />\nwith Judge Hammerman. The<br />\nJudge was and still is an advisor<br />\nto the club and constantly<br />\nworked with the boys.<br />\nOvercrowded<br />\nAlthough attending an<br />\novercrowded high school, Gary<br />\nexcelled at basketball and<br />\nlacrosse, while maintaining<br />\napproximately a 90 average in his<br />\nacademic work. Due to City<br />\nCollege's large enrollment and<br />\nsplit sessions, athletes could only<br />\n<br />\nparticipate for two years at the<br />\nvarsity level.<br />\nAthletic wise, his senior year<br />\nbestowed two great honors upon<br />\nhim. He was named to the second<br />\nteam all-Maryland in basketball<br />\nand first team all-Maryland in<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nGary decided to attend<br />\nHopkins for both athletic and<br />\nacademic reasons. A social and<br />\nbehavioral science area major,<br />\nHandleman hopes to attend law<br />\nschool after he graduates.<br />\nThis past year has been an<br />\nextremely important one for<br />\nHandleman, since he was elected<br />\ncaptain of both the Hopkins<br />\nbasketball and lacrosse teams,<br />\nand was recently wed in<br />\nDecember. Barbara, his wife,sees<br />\nall of his games, but her<br />\nknowledge of the two sports isn't<br />\nmuch more than minimal.<br />\nShe, like most other wives or<br />\ngirlfriends, is quite biased in her<br />\nanalysis of the game, but she has<br />\nan understanding ear and is a<br />\ngood listener.<br />\nFundamentals<br />\nSports has always played an<br />\nimportant part in Gary's life,<br />\nstarting with Lancers and<br />\ncontinuing through his years at<br />\nHopkins. He credits his high<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nschool coaches with teaching him<br />\nfundamentals and his Hopkins<br />\ncoaches with developing them.<br />\nLast year's lacrosse team had,<br />\nand this year's basketball team is<br />\nhaving, a disappointing season.<br />\nLike most athletes, both good<br />\nand bad, he feels that it is very<br />\nhard to \"get up\" for each game<br />\nwhen your team is losing, and yet<br />\nhe continues to do so.<br />\nHowever, he is looking<br />\nforward to a much better second<br />\nhalf during the basketball season<br />\nand a possible national<br />\nchampionship in lacrosse.<br />\n\"It's different for anyone,<br />\nespecially Gary, to say which<br />\nsport he is better at or enjoys<br />\nmore. \"During basketball season<br />\nI like basketball more but when<br />\nbasketball is over and lacrosse<br />\nstarts, I like lacrosse more.\"<br />\nThe two sports at Hopkins are<br />\nlike day and night, they are a<br />\ncompletely different caliber of<br />\nball. As Handleman commented,<br />\n\"Playing lacrosse here is like<br />\nplaying basketball at UCLA, or<br />\nfootball at Notre Dame.\"<br />\nSimilar<br />\nThe two sports are quite<br />\nsimilar in his eyes, and even some<br />\nof the plays are the same. You<br />\nhave to set pick-and-rolls and<br />\n<br />\nboth sports require great<br />\namounts of finesse and practice.<br />\nTeam sports usually require<br />\nlonger and harder practices in<br />\norder tb learn how one's<br />\nteammates play and to anticipate<br />\ntheir moves.<br />\nAlthough Gary's life is pretty<br />\nmuch occupied with his wife,<br />\nathletics, and studying, he has<br />\nremained involved with his old<br />\nboyhood club, Lancers, and he<br />\nenjoys travel. He has become an<br />\nadvisor to the younger boys in<br />\nthe club, and during the summer<br />\nof 1970, he went to Australia on<br />\na lacrosse tour.<br />\nGary Handleman is a star. He,<br />\nis a star basketball player, a star<br />\nlacrosse player, a star student,<br />\nbut most importantly, he is a star<br />\nperson.<br />\n<br />\nBy ED BRETHAtiER<br />\nLast year, the Hopkins'<br />\nwrestling team was barely able to<br />\nwin two of its matches while<br />\nlosing ten, despite the excellent<br />\nguidance of head coach Bob<br />\nSisk.<br />\nThis year, the story is entirely<br />\ndifferent, with the team now<br />\nholding a record of 6-3-1, even<br />\nthough the recruitment during<br />\nthe off-season was minimal, and<br />\nthe influx of new wrestlers small.<br />\nMany fans have offered their own<br />\nexplanations of this<br />\nphenomenom, but, according to<br />\nCoach Harry Gotwals, there are<br />\nbasically three reasons for this<br />\nturnabout.<br />\nFirst of all, new head coach,<br />\nHarry Gotwals, is a more<br />\nunderstanding man, and<br />\nHandleman contributed four<br />\ncommands a better relationship<br />\nmore points later in the period,<br />\nwith the team than Coach Sisk<br />\nbringing his game-high total to<br />\never did.<br />\ntwenty, and Bobby Freedman<br />\nAs Gotwals put it, \"I think<br />\nadded six points to finish with<br />\nthat I'm the only wrestling coach<br />\nfourteen. Lenny Pugatch,starting<br />\nat Hopkins' that has actually<br />\nhis third game, played<br />\nwrestled here as an<br />\noutstandingly on defensive and undergr<br />\naduate. As a result, I<br />\ngrabbed many important think<br />\nI understand better how<br />\nrebounds.<br />\nthe students live and what they<br />\nIn winning their third game, actually intend to get out of all<br />\nthe Blue Jay basketball team sports; Coach Sisk was a great<br />\nshowed promising notes for coach, but he couldn't really<br />\nfinishing the season strongly after cope with the students<br />\non a<br />\nan extremely slow and personal level.\"<br />\ndisappointing start.<br />\nGotwals has indeed done a fine<br />\n<br />\nB-ballers topple Ursinus<br />\n, Following a Wednesday<br />\nevening loss at the hands of a<br />\nstrong Navy team, the Blue Jay<br />\nbasketball squad bounced back<br />\nwith a 60-47 thumping of<br />\nUrsinus. Again it was the three<br />\nman attack of Gary Handleman,<br />\nBilly Jews, and Bobby Freedman<br />\nwho paved the way offensively,<br />\nas they combined for forty-seven<br />\nof the team's sixty points.<br />\nThe Jays started the first half<br />\nquickly and jumped to a 17-8<br />\nlead, but a strong Ursinus team<br />\nbattled back. With Bill Jews and<br />\nLen Pugatch, the starting Blue<br />\nJay bigmen, sitting on the bench,<br />\nUrsinus controlled both the<br />\noffensive and the defensive<br />\nboards. A poor offensively<br />\nplayed first half ended with the<br />\nBlue Jays leading by a single<br />\npoint, 22-21.<br />\nGary Handleman and Bobby<br />\nFreedman provided the spark in<br />\nthe early going as they chipped in<br />\neight and. seven points<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nCold Shooting<br />\nCold shooting marked the<br />\nbeginning of the second half for<br />\nthe Jays as they went scoreless<br />\n'for 2:46 after the tip-off.<br />\nHowever, when the Blue Jays<br />\nfinally did score, it was Gary<br />\nHandleman connecting for eight<br />\nstraight points.<br />\nA season battle emerged with<br />\nneither team able to break the<br />\n<br />\ngame open, until 8:12 showed<br />\non the clock. With Hopkins<br />\nahead by a mere 41-38 score, the<br />\nJays ran off fifteen unanswered<br />\npoints. A ha\u2018yking Hopkins<br />\ndefense masterminded the<br />\nsplurge holding Ursinus scoreless<br />\nfor more than seven and a half<br />\nminutes. Taking advantage of<br />\neasy, percentage shots, the Blue<br />\nJays turned a nip-and-tuck game<br />\ninto a rout.<br />\nBilly Jews came alive in the<br />\nsecond half scoring all twelve of<br />\nhis points and dominating the<br />\ndefensive boards.

Another freshman,<br />\nRoger Brooks, while not having<br />\nas good a record as Pucillo, has<br />\nalso successfully filled the 126 lb.<br />\nposition, thus avoiding early<br />\nforfeits.<br />\nThe. heavyweight position has<br />\nbeen filled this season by<br />\nnewcomer Joe Schwartz, who<br />\nshould do much better once he<br />\nhas gotten some experience and<br />\nknowledge of the different<br />\nmoves. Again the most important<br />\nthing is that he does wrestle, and<br />\nthereby prevents an easy points<br />\nfrom going to the opposition.<br />\nA third reason for the team's<br />\nsuccess this season has been the<br />\ndedicated performance of such<br />\nne corners as Bob Fink, who has<br />\nbecome a very competitive<br />\nwrestler at 150 lbs.<br />\n<br />\nJay wrestlers tie Western Maryland<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nA small, but enthusiastic,<br />\ncrowd of about eighty fans were<br />\non hand Wednesday night to<br />\nwatch the Western Maryland<br />\nwrestling team, whose record<br />\ngoing into the meet was 4-2, tie<br />\nthe Blue Jays of Hopkins with 2<br />\nrecord of 6-3.<br />\nFreshman Ron Pucillo started<br />\nthe meet off in a winning fashion<br />\nas he beat his opponent with<br />\nfifteen seconds left to go in his<br />\nmatch. As the clock ticked off its<br />\nfinal seconds, Pucillo, one point<br />\nbehind, turned his man on his<br />\n<br />\nback as the referee awarded him<br />\na predicament worth two points<br />\nWinning Streak<br />\nAfter Hopkins' freshman<br />\nRoger Brooks was pinned by<br />\nMaryland's Tom Yates, the Blue<br />\nJays began a three match winning<br />\nstreak in the 1344b., 142-1b., and<br />\n1504b. weight classes; senior Jeff<br />\nTurshen winning 13-3, freshman<br />\nClark Kingery winning 10-3 and<br />\nsophomore Greg Goldman<br />\nshutting out his opponent 4-0.<br />\nJunior Harry Harper lost the<br />\n158-1b. weight class match by a<br />\n9-2 decision, but freshman Mel<br />\n<br />\nMorse came back in the third<br />\nperiod of his match to win 7-5<br />\nover his opponent.<br />\nDick Schmertzler captured<br />\nMaryland's third match in the<br />\n177-1b. weight class with an 11-1<br />\ndecision against sophomore Craig<br />\nStevens of Hopkins, however, the<br />\nscore was not indicative of the<br />\ncloseness of the match.<br />\nOne hundred and ninety<br />\npounder, sophomore Neil<br />\nHazard, gave the Jays a six point<br />\nlead by winning a decision match<br />\n7-3. In the final match of the<br />\nevening, Hopkins' heavy-weight<br />\n<br />\nsophomore, Joe Schwartz, lost to<br />\nhis opponent by a pin in the<br />\nthird period which gave Western<br />\nMaryland the six points needed<br />\nto tie the score.<br />\nLast Year<br />\nThe last three meets have seen<br />\nthe Blue Jay grapplers in a down<br />\nhill trend with two consecutive<br />\nlosses and a tie.

Now, the same<br />\nelitist philosophy that has been the guiding light of<br />\nsuch reactionary thinking has surfaced at Hopkins.<br />\nLast year a report was approved by the Academic<br />\nCouncil which would have been a beginning towards<br />\nthe alleviation of one of the nation's problems \u2014 the<br />\nmany years required for a medical education. The<br />\nso-called \"2-2-2\" program can save the aspiring<br />\nphysician two years that could be devoted to his<br />\nprofession.<br />\nAfter the Council added its stamp of approval, the<br />\nway seemed clear for the program's implementation.<br />\nBut then the doctors stepped in the way. Concern for<br />\nso-called elites at Homewood and well-rounded<br />\neducation for doctors seems a thin disguise for<br />\ntraditional medical elitism \u2014 the same sort of elitism<br />\nthat caused friction over former Dean Rogers'<br />\ncommunity concern, or causes medical school<br />\nenrollment to be so strictly limited. An attitude of \"I<br />\nwent through it, so they can too\" seems to prevail and<br />\nstand in the way of meaningful progress. A<br />\nreceptiveness for change on the part of the medical<br />\nschool faculty is going to be necessary before the<br />\napparent backslide at East Baltimore can be checked<br />\nand replaced by the \"rhythm of achievement\" that<br />\nPresident Muller has promised us.<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nPart of the Solution<br />\nIn our last article on \"Competition,\"<br />\npublished here in December, we decried<br />\nsome of the destructive aspects of the<br />\ncompetitive system characteristic of<br />\nHopkins. Competition is dehumanizing to<br />\nall those who participate in it, causing<br />\nthem to become insensitive to the real<br />\npurpose of education. We said that the<br />\nmost important function of education is<br />\nto teach men to serve the benefit of all.<br />\nAll sight of this function is lost when<br />\nsuccessful participation in the<br />\ncompetitive system becomes an end in<br />\nitself. University education, when based<br />\nupon the premise of competitive conflict,<br />\nbecomes an integral part of the<br />\nsel f-perperpe t rating socializing<br />\nmechanism which forces men to lose<br />\ntheir concern for real human needs.<br />\nHaving become blind to the humanness<br />\nof others, we ultimately lose our 'own<br />\nhumanity. In an increasingly<br />\nself-degrading process, continuous<br />\nparticipation in this system, without<br />\nconcern for anything but our specific role<br />\nin it, cau%es us to assume cobot-like<br />\nc)tia)t)cs. We automaticany Nigh) to<br />\naccept the reason and rationale of<br />\ncompetition, in an almost pevlovian<br />\nresponse. Without questioning the<br />\nsignificance of our individual roles,<br />\nacceptance of the dehumanizing agents of<br />\nAmerican society (eg-hydrogen bombs, a<br />\nwar-based economy, poverty in the midst<br />\nof riches, etc.) remains an undeniable<br />\npossibility. In ignoring individuality, the<br />\nfoundation of our moral bankruptcy and<br />\npsychological insecurity is laid. We who<br />\nare trained by American educational<br />\ninstitutions are potentially given the<br />\nmeans to transcend this destructive<br />\ncompetitive system. Failing to act<br />\nproductively toward that end with our<br />\nnew found awareness induces in us a<br />\nsense of guilt.<br />\nInsecurity<br />\nIndeed, it is a sign of our moral and<br />\npsychological insecurity which forces us<br />\nto compete with one another, without<br />\nregard for those we compete with or<br />\nagainst. Thus, having stated the problem,<br />\nwe can understand it. By being members<br />\nof the intellectual elite, by being<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community. we<br />\nneed not participate in destructive<br />\nconzpetition. We can understand the<br />\ninsensitivity inherent in competition, and<br />\nbegin to find solutions. This denial of the<br />\nutility of competition can only<br />\ncontribute to our security. The denial of<br />\ncompetition can satisfy our demands for<br /><br />\nHopkins Union<br /><br />\na productive development of our lives.<br />\nFinally, it ensures that no damage to the<br />\npsychological essence of our compatriots<br />\nor ourselves is done.<br />\nWhere, then, does the solution lie?<br />\nWhat is the alternative to competition?<br />\nOne solution begins with the adoption of<br />\ncooperation as the basic structure of this<br />\ncommunity within itself and in its<br />\nrelations with society.<br />\nWhy cooperation rather than<br />\ncompetition? Because cooperation is, in<br />\nthe long run, more productive for society<br />\nas a whole than is competition. While<br />\ncompetition may serve the self interest of<br />\nthose who succeed at it, in the short run,<br />\nit will be harmful to them as to society,<br />\nin the final analysis. Having \"made it,\"<br />\ntheir fight must forever after be one to<br />\ndefend their position and to defend the<br />\nsystem of competition which allowed<br />\nthem to succeed. From then on, their<br />\nactivities can no longer be directed<br />\ntowards contribution to a society which<br />\nhas permitted them success.

It negates the<br />\ndehumanizing process of competition<br />\nwhich blindly and subtly destroys both<br />\nsociety and its individual members.<br />\nWe've pointed out what we feel is one<br />\nmuch better alternative to destructive<br />\ncompetition. Within the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, cooperation can exist, if we<br />\naccept the premise that we are all here<br />\nfor the same purpose: to acquire an<br />\neducation. Though individual demands<br />\nwith regard to education certainly may<br />\nvary, the satisfaction of each of our needs<br />\ncan only be accomplished through<br />\ncooperation amongst ourselves.

The Hopkins Union, an<br />\naddition to Levering Hall, should be ready by<br />\nSeptember of 1973, and hopefully will help unite the<br />\nHopkins community and improve campus life. Much<br />\nof the money for the union and a renovation of<br />\nLevering Hall has already been raised. Most of the<br />\ncredit for this project should go to former president<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower. Others, too, deserve praise for<br />\nthe progress that has been made so far.<br />\nThe planning committee, which includes students,<br />\nfaculty and administration, did an admirable job in<br />\ndetermining the needs that had to be met by the<br />\nHopkins Union. Fortunately, neither the architect nor<br />\nthe planning committee have allowed themselves to be<br />\ntrapped by rigid notions about a student union. The<br />\ntwo key rooms of the addition, the looking-listening<br />\nroom and the multi-use room, seem to offer great<br />\npossibilities for growth. Even Phoebe Stanton, whose<br />\nskepticism about the University's taste is legendary,<br />\ncommented, \"The flexible design of the interior can<br />\ngenerate new uses for the rooms. Things can<br />\nspontaneously come into being.\"<br />\nWe hope students and others will contribute<br />\nsuggestions for the uses of the rooms, and that when<br />\nthe Hopkins Union is finally completed, everyone will<br />\ntake full advantage of it.<br /><br />\n'When I Use A Word,It Me ans Just<br />\nWhat I Choose It To Mean<br />\nNeither More Nor Less'<br /><br />\nEngland. the play succeeded in<br />\ntranscending, in escaping itself, offering a<br />\ntimeless message to the ambitious, the<br />\nbourgeois, the blind.

An un-tenured professor<br />\nwas sent out to the dorm snack-bar for<br />\nbacon and tomato sandwiches. Finally,it<br />\nis decided to begin phase II of the<br />\noperation.

Initial reactions to the<br />\ndisclosures were generally voices of shock<br />\nat the presence of organized subversive<br />\nactions on campus. When interviewed,<br />\none student stated, \"I don't know<br />\nanything about it.

He does it all so<br />\nwell, and yet he makes it look so<br />\nvery easy. Gary Handleman was<br />\nnot made into an athlete, he was<br />\nborn one.<br />\nGary began his athletic career<br />\nat Lancers, a boys club in<br />\nBaltimore. He first played<br />\norganized basketball and lacrosse<br />\nthere, and while doing so, made<br />\nsome life-long friends. At the<br />\nclub he first came into contact<br />\nwith Judge Hammerman. The<br />\nJudge was and still is an advisor<br />\nto the club and constantly<br />\nworked with the boys.<br />\nOvercrowded<br />\nAlthough attending an<br />\novercrowded high school, Gary<br />\nexcelled at basketball and<br />\nlacrosse, while maintaining<br />\napproximately a 90 average in his<br />\nacademic work. Due to City<br />\nCollege's large enrollment and<br />\nsplit sessions, athletes could only<br /><br />\nparticipate for two years at the<br />\nvarsity level.<br />\nAthletic wise, his senior year<br />\nbestowed two great honors upon<br />\nhim. He was named to the second<br />\nteam all-Maryland in basketball<br />\nand first team all-Maryland in<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nGary decided to attend<br />\nHopkins for both athletic and<br />\nacademic reasons. A social and<br />\nbehavioral science area major,<br />\nHandleman hopes to attend law<br />\nschool after he graduates.<br />\nThis past year has been an<br />\nextremely important one for<br />\nHandleman, since he was elected<br />\ncaptain of both the Hopkins<br />\nbasketball and lacrosse teams,<br />\nand was recently wed in<br />\nDecember. Barbara, his wife,sees<br />\nall of his games, but her<br />\nknowledge of the two sports isn't<br />\nmuch more than minimal.<br />\nShe, like most other wives or<br />\ngirlfriends, is quite biased in her<br />\nanalysis of the game, but she has<br />\nan understanding ear and is a<br />\ngood listener.<br />\nFundamentals<br />\nSports has always played an<br />\nimportant part in Gary's life,<br />\nstarting with Lancers and<br />\ncontinuing through his years at<br />\nHopkins. He credits his high<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nschool coaches with teaching him<br />\nfundamentals and his Hopkins<br />\ncoaches with developing them.<br />\nLast year's lacrosse team had,<br />\nand this year's basketball team is<br />\nhaving, a disappointing season.<br />\nLike most athletes, both good<br />\nand bad, he feels that it is very<br />\nhard to \"get up\" for each game<br />\nwhen your team is losing, and yet<br />\nhe continues to do so.<br />\nHowever, he is looking<br />\nforward to a much better second<br />\nhalf during the basketball season<br />\nand a possible national<br />\nchampionship in lacrosse.<br />\n\"It's different for anyone,<br />\nespecially Gary, to say which<br />\nsport he is better at or enjoys<br />\nmore. \"During basketball season<br />\nI like basketball more but when<br />\nbasketball is over and lacrosse<br />\nstarts, I like lacrosse more.\"<br />\nThe two sports at Hopkins are<br />\nlike day and night, they are a<br />\ncompletely different caliber of<br />\nball. As Handleman commented,<br />\n\"Playing lacrosse here is like<br />\nplaying basketball at UCLA, or<br />\nfootball at Notre Dame.\"<br />\nSimilar<br />\nThe two sports are quite<br />\nsimilar in his eyes, and even some<br />\nof the plays are the same. You<br />\nhave to set pick-and-rolls and<br /><br />\nboth sports require great<br />\namounts of finesse and practice.<br />\nTeam sports usually require<br />\nlonger and harder practices in<br />\norder tb learn how one's<br />\nteammates play and to anticipate<br />\ntheir moves.<br />\nAlthough Gary's life is pretty<br />\nmuch occupied with his wife,<br />\nathletics, and studying, he has<br />\nremained involved with his old<br />\nboyhood club, Lancers, and he<br />\nenjoys travel. He has become an<br />\nadvisor to the younger boys in<br />\nthe club, and during the summer<br />\nof 1970, he went to Australia on<br />\na lacrosse tour.<br />\nGary Handleman is a star. He,<br />\nis a star basketball player, a star<br />\nlacrosse player, a star student,<br />\nbut most importantly, he is a star<br />\nperson.<br /><br />\nBy ED BRETHAtiER<br />\nLast year, the Hopkins'<br />\nwrestling team was barely able to<br />\nwin two of its matches while<br />\nlosing ten, despite the excellent<br />\nguidance of head coach Bob<br />\nSisk.<br />\nThis year, the story is entirely<br />\ndifferent, with the team now<br />\nholding a record of 6-3-1, even<br />\nthough the recruitment during<br />\nthe off-season was minimal, and<br />\nthe influx of new wrestlers small.<br />\nMany fans have offered their own<br />\nexplanations of this<br />\nphenomenom, but, according to<br />\nCoach Harry Gotwals, there are<br />\nbasically three reasons for this<br />\nturnabout.<br />\nFirst of all, new head coach,<br />\nHarry Gotwals, is a more<br />\nunderstanding man, and<br />\nHandleman contributed four<br />\ncommands a better relationship<br />\nmore points later in the period,<br />\nwith the team than Coach Sisk<br />\nbringing his game-high total to<br />\never did.<br />\ntwenty, and Bobby Freedman<br />\nAs Gotwals put it, \"I think<br />\nadded six points to finish with<br />\nthat I'm the only wrestling coach<br />\nfourteen. Lenny Pugatch,starting<br />\nat Hopkins' that has actually<br />\nhis third game, played<br />\nwrestled here as an<br />\noutstandingly on defensive and undergr<br />\naduate. As a result, I<br />\ngrabbed many important think<br />\nI understand better how<br />\nrebounds.<br />\nthe students live and what they<br />\nIn winning their third game, actually intend to get out of all<br />\nthe Blue Jay basketball team sports; Coach Sisk was a great<br />\nshowed promising notes for coach, but he couldn't really<br />\nfinishing the season strongly after cope with the students<br />\non a<br />\nan extremely slow and personal level.\"<br />\ndisappointing start.<br />\nGotwals has indeed done a fine<br /><br />\nB-ballers topple Ursinus<br />\n, Following a Wednesday<br />\nevening loss at the hands of a<br />\nstrong Navy team, the Blue Jay<br />\nbasketball squad bounced back<br />\nwith a 60-47 thumping of<br />\nUrsinus. Again it was the three<br />\nman attack of Gary Handleman,<br />\nBilly Jews, and Bobby Freedman<br />\nwho paved the way offensively,<br />\nas they combined for forty-seven<br />\nof the team's sixty points.<br />\nThe Jays started the first half<br />\nquickly and jumped to a 17-8<br />\nlead, but a strong Ursinus team<br />\nbattled back. With Bill Jews and<br />\nLen Pugatch, the starting Blue<br />\nJay bigmen, sitting on the bench,<br />\nUrsinus controlled both the<br />\noffensive and the defensive<br />\nboards. A poor offensively<br />\nplayed first half ended with the<br />\nBlue Jays leading by a single<br />\npoint, 22-21.<br />\nGary Handleman and Bobby<br />\nFreedman provided the spark in<br />\nthe early going as they chipped in<br />\neight and. seven points<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nCold Shooting<br />\nCold shooting marked the<br />\nbeginning of the second half for<br />\nthe Jays as they went scoreless<br />\n'for 2:46 after the tip-off.<br />\nHowever, when the Blue Jays<br />\nfinally did score, it was Gary<br />\nHandleman connecting for eight<br />\nstraight points.<br />\nA season battle emerged with<br />\nneither team able to break the<br /><br />\ngame open, until 8:12 showed<br />\non the clock. With Hopkins<br />\nahead by a mere 41-38 score, the<br />\nJays ran off fifteen unanswered<br />\npoints. A ha\u2018yking Hopkins<br />\ndefense masterminded the<br />\nsplurge holding Ursinus scoreless<br />\nfor more than seven and a half<br />\nminutes. Taking advantage of<br />\neasy, percentage shots, the Blue<br />\nJays turned a nip-and-tuck game<br />\ninto a rout.<br />\nBilly Jews came alive in the<br />\nsecond half scoring all twelve of<br />\nhis points and dominating the<br />\ndefensive boards. Gary<br /><br />\nGary Handleman<br /><br />\nWrestling team<br />\nis revitalized<br /><br />\nspo<br />\n60-47<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\njob in this area, making himself<br />\navailable on campus to talk over<br />\nparticular problems.<br />\nAs a second reason for the<br />\nteam's success, Gotwals stated<br />\nthat for the first time in Hopkins'<br />\nhistory, the team has managed to<br />\nfill all of the weight classes,<br />\nincluding the long neglected 118<br />\nlb. and heavy- weight classes.<br />\nThis year, freshman Ron<br />\nPucillo has wrestled very well,<br />\nclaiming a 6-4 record, and most<br />\nimportantly, no forfeits, which<br />\ngrant to the other an automatic<br />\nsix points. Another freshman,<br />\nRoger Brooks, while not having<br />\nas good a record as Pucillo, has<br />\nalso successfully filled the 126 lb.<br />\nposition, thus avoiding early<br />\nforfeits.<br />\nThe. heavyweight position has<br />\nbeen filled this season by<br />\nnewcomer Joe Schwartz, who<br />\nshould do much better once he<br />\nhas gotten some experience and<br />\nknowledge of the different<br />\nmoves. Again the most important<br />\nthing is that he does wrestle, and<br />\nthereby prevents an easy points<br />\nfrom going to the opposition.<br />\nA third reason for the team's<br />\nsuccess this season has been the<br />\ndedicated performance of such<br />\nne corners as Bob Fink, who has<br />\nbecome a very competitive<br />\nwrestler at 150 lbs.<br /><br />\nJay wrestlers tie Western Maryland<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nA small, but enthusiastic,<br />\ncrowd of about eighty fans were<br />\non hand Wednesday night to<br />\nwatch the Western Maryland<br />\nwrestling team, whose record<br />\ngoing into the meet was 4-2, tie<br />\nthe Blue Jays of Hopkins with 2<br />\nrecord of 6-3.<br />\nFreshman Ron Pucillo started<br />\nthe meet off in a winning fashion<br />\nas he beat his opponent with<br />\nfifteen seconds left to go in his<br />\nmatch. As the clock ticked off its<br />\nfinal seconds, Pucillo, one point<br />\nbehind, turned his man on his<br /><br />\nback as the referee awarded him<br />\na predicament worth two points<br />\nWinning Streak<br />\nAfter Hopkins' freshman<br />\nRoger Brooks was pinned by<br />\nMaryland's Tom Yates, the Blue<br />\nJays began a three match winning<br />\nstreak in the 1344b., 142-1b., and<br />\n1504b. weight classes; senior Jeff<br />\nTurshen winning 13-3, freshman<br />\nClark Kingery winning 10-3 and<br />\nsophomore Greg Goldman<br />\nshutting out his opponent 4-0.<br />\nJunior Harry Harper lost the<br />\n158-1b. weight class match by a<br />\n9-2 decision, but freshman Mel<br /><br />\nMorse came back in the third<br />\nperiod of his match to win 7-5<br />\nover his opponent.<br />\nDick Schmertzler captured<br />\nMaryland's third match in the<br />\n177-1b. weight class with an 11-1<br />\ndecision against sophomore Craig<br />\nStevens of Hopkins, however, the<br />\nscore was not indicative of the<br />\ncloseness of the match.<br />\nOne hundred and ninety<br />\npounder, sophomore Neil<br />\nHazard, gave the Jays a six point<br />\nlead by winning a decision match<br />\n7-3. In the final match of the<br />\nevening, Hopkins' heavy-weight<br /><br />\nsophomore, Joe Schwartz, lost to<br />\nhis opponent by a pin in the<br />\nthird period which gave Western<br />\nMaryland the six points needed<br />\nto tie the score.<br />\nLast Year<br />\nThe last three meets have seen<br />\nthe Blue Jay grapplers in a down<br />\nhill trend with two consecutive<br />\nlosses and a tie.
