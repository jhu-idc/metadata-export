Of these \"First<br />\nTwenty Fellows,\" Dr. Lanman and<br />\nDr. Sihler are the only survivors.<br />\nOthers, of whom the old man spoke<br />\naffectionately, included Walter Hines<br />\nPage, later our Ambassador at the<br />\nCourt of St. James' Palace, Josiah<br />\nRoyce, Nicholas Murray, and Thomas<br />\nCharles Murray, uncles of the prominent President of Columbia University, Nicholas Murray Butler.<br />\nIn describing the policies of President Gilman Dr. Lanman said, \"One<br />\nhappiest<br />\nPresident<br />\nGilman's<br />\nof<br />\nthoughts in the very opening year of<br />\n1876 was the invitation of distinguished men of science and letters<br />\nfrom elsewhere to act as Visiting<br />\nProfessors at Hopkins.

I am glad of this opportunity to remind you of Gilman, and<br />\nof his loving enthusiasm and devotion.\"<br />\nEarlier in his short address, Dr.<br />\nLanman referred back to those first<br />\ndays\u2014\"Is there a single one here, I<br />\nwonder, who still remembers the<br />\nprimeval days of Hopkins, when<br />\nmotherly Mrs. Egerton, and her sister, 'Aunt Betty,' played such a modest but highly important part in providing us students and bachelor<br />\nteachers with wholesome food? It<br />\nwas wholesome, and incidentally, delicious . . . And ample was the reason<br />\nwe had for attending the voluntary<br />\nreligious assembly for Christian worship, and giving thanks for a good<br />\nbreakfast on which to start the day's<br />\nwork. For the religious attitude of<br />\nthe University was a matter of deep<br />\nconcern to Mr. Gilman. In October,<br />\n1876, a Presbyterian minister of Baltimore with reference to the Opening<br />\nLecture of Huxley said: It was bad<br />\nenough to invite Huxley. It were<br />\nbetter to have asked God to be present. It would have been absurd to<br />\nhave asked them both.' On this Mr.<br />\nGilman comments: 'People were on<br />\nthe alert for impiety, and disappointed to find no traces of it.' Sixty-one<br />\nyears after, in the present year of<br />\ngrace, 1937, it sounds\u2014well, funny.\"<br />\n<br />\nWolman Addresses Peace Committee<br />\nPhi B. K.

Because of the natural animosity between Fascism and<br />\nCommunism, and because of her<br />\nfriendly relations with Japan, Germany has regarded Russia with ill<br />\nfeeling. But because of geographical<br />\nconditions an attack on Russia by<br />\nGermany would have necessitated an<br />\ninvasion through Polidh territory.<br />\nTo prevent a recurrence of the Belgo-German condition of 1914, Germany<br />\nentered into the 1935 negotiations of<br />\nthe German-Polish Entente. Sympathy in Poland gradually grew favorably towards this union for several<br />\nreasons. Poland would gain Russian<br />\n\u2022 territory as recompense, the population of Poland is greatly German,<br />\nand the government of Poland is<br />\ncomposed of late Austrian and German generals.

Of these \"First<br />\nTwenty Fellows,\" Dr. Lanman and<br />\nDr. Sihler are the only survivors.<br />\nOthers, of whom the old man spoke<br />\naffectionately, included Walter Hines<br />\nPage, later our Ambassador at the<br />\nCourt of St. James' Palace, Josiah<br />\nRoyce, Nicholas Murray, and Thomas<br />\nCharles Murray, uncles of the prominent President of Columbia University, Nicholas Murray Butler.<br />\nIn describing the policies of President Gilman Dr. Lanman said, \"One<br />\nhappiest<br />\nPresident<br />\nGilman's<br />\nof<br />\nthoughts in the very opening year of<br />\n1876 was the invitation of distinguished men of science and letters<br />\nfrom elsewhere to act as Visiting<br />\nProfessors at Hopkins. Judge Cooley,<br />\nthe constitutional lawyer, came from<br />\nthe University of Michigan. Harvard<br />\nloaned her two leading men of letters, Child and Russell Lowell . . . .<br />\nWith a cheerful dash of colloquialism<br /><br />\nGilman says: 'Sometimes bright students were spotted by these Visiting<br />\nProfessors, and afterwards invited<br />\nto positions of usefulness and distinction elsewhere.'<br />\n\"Of the various parties to this<br />\nwide-visioned proceeding of Gilman<br />\nas a University President, one asks<br />\nwhich will admire him most, the<br />\nother University Presidents, or the<br />\nVisiting Spotters, or the visited Spottees? . . . . I am glad of this opportunity to remind you of Gilman, and<br />\nof his loving enthusiasm and devotion.\"<br />\nEarlier in his short address, Dr.<br />\nLanman referred back to those first<br />\ndays\u2014\"Is there a single one here, I<br />\nwonder, who still remembers the<br />\nprimeval days of Hopkins, when<br />\nmotherly Mrs. Egerton, and her sister, 'Aunt Betty,' played such a modest but highly important part in providing us students and bachelor<br />\nteachers with wholesome food? It<br />\nwas wholesome, and incidentally, delicious . . . And ample was the reason<br />\nwe had for attending the voluntary<br />\nreligious assembly for Christian worship, and giving thanks for a good<br />\nbreakfast on which to start the day's<br />\nwork. For the religious attitude of<br />\nthe University was a matter of deep<br />\nconcern to Mr. Gilman. In October,<br />\n1876, a Presbyterian minister of Baltimore with reference to the Opening<br />\nLecture of Huxley said: It was bad<br />\nenough to invite Huxley. It were<br />\nbetter to have asked God to be present. It would have been absurd to<br />\nhave asked them both.' On this Mr.<br />\nGilman comments: 'People were on<br />\nthe alert for impiety, and disappointed to find no traces of it.' Sixty-one<br />\nyears after, in the present year of<br />\ngrace, 1937, it sounds\u2014well, funny.\"<br /><br />\nWolman Addresses Peace Committee<br />\nPhi B. K.
