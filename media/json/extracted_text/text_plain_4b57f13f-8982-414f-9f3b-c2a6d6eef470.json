He has been harried, villified and scorned. A wave of<br />\nantagonism to him followed the war mania, since mob suspicion<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nwas sure to detect in him the menacing red streak of a revolutionary.

Is he the wild-eyed malcontent and mystic rebel so threateningly pictured by the yellow press who find no cruelty painful<br />\nenough to ascribe to him? Or is he the weak-willed blind enthusiast,<br />\nstriving after butterfly creations of his imagination. Indeed, there<br />\nare some who are all that and perhaps the world is right in denouncing them.<br />\nBut far more numerous and important are those groups of intellectuals who see in society and in life more than the primitive<br />\nrudimentary elements of food getting, self preserving, and replenishing the earth. They view life as capable of being moulded to the will<br />\nof men and fashioned to their ideas and ideals. They find in life<br />\nmystic interests and subtle values unconceived by the man of the<br />\nstreet.

Or is he the weak-willed blind enthusiast,<br />\nstriving after butterfly creations of his imagination. Indeed, there<br />\nare some who are all that and perhaps the world is right in denouncing them.<br />\nBut far more numerous and important are those groups of intellectuals who see in society and in life more than the primitive<br />\nrudimentary elements of food getting, self preserving, and replenishing the earth. They view life as capable of being moulded to the will<br />\nof men and fashioned to their ideas and ideals.
