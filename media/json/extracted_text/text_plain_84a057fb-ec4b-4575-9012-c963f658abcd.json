The University will also prohibit<br />\nsolicitation that is unlawful, against University<br />\nregularttions, or is considered \"not to be in the best<br />\ninterests of the University.\"<br />\nThe HAC's action, while seeming to reflect<br />\nenormous concern on the part of the administration in<br />\nregards to those issues on campus that bother the<br />\nstudents, actually reflects the group's traditional role<br />\nas a rubber stamp for sanctifying policy decisions<br />\nhanded down from the administration.

It<br />\nwas the fiftieth meeting of the<br />\ntwo teams in the rivalry which<br />\ndates back to 1894. Entering the<br />\ngame, Hopkins held a slim lead in<br />\nthe series, 24 victories to 21 for<br />\nthe Terrors, with four ties. The<br />\nTerrors were out to avenge their<br />\n14-13 loss to the Blue Jays last<br />\nyear which cost them the league<br />\nchampionship.<br />\nHopkins kicked off to the<br />\nhosts who returned the ball to<br />\ntheir 32. After three first downs<br />\nhad moved the ball to the Blue<br />\nJay 27, linebacker Craig Stevens<br />\nthwarted the Terror effort with<br />\nan interception at the 24.<br />\nThree plays later, quarterback<br />\nJack Thomas hit senior wide<br />\n, receiver Grant Shevchik with a<br />\n44 yard strike that advanced the<br />\nball to the Terror 28. Bill Nolan<br />\n<br />\ngained 16 yards on a sweep to<br />\nthe left, but the drive was halted<br />\nwhen Jerry Downes intercepted<br />\nThomas in the end zone and ran<br />\nthe ball out to the eight.<br />\nThree running plays gained<br />\neight yards for the Terrors. On<br />\nfourth down, punter Nelson<br />\nShaffer attempted a pass which,<br />\nluckily for Hopkins, fell<br />\nincomplete giving the Blue Jays<br />\npossession on the Terror 15 yard<br />\nline.<br />\nCarries by Nolan, halfback<br />\nTim Doyle, and senior fullback<br />\nJim Ferguson advanced the ball<br />\nto the one. On third down.<br />\nThomas scored on a quarterback<br />\nsneak, with his conversion<br />\nmaking the score 7-0.<br />\nAfter an exchange of punts,<br />\nthe quarter ended with Western<br />\nMaryland on the Hopkins 43. On<br />\nthe first play of the second<br />\nquarter, Terror quarterback Mike<br />\nBricker hit tight end Andy<br />\nKeefer for 22 yards and a first<br />\n<br />\nJack Thomas rolls right preparing to pass<br />\n<br />\n:t<br />\nPhil Alba starts his charge behind a wall of block,ers<br />\ndown. Bricker then sWepf left<br />\nend and fumbled the ball when<br />\nbelted by the aggressive Jay<br />\ndefense. Several members of the<br />\ndefensive unit had a shot at the<br />\nrolling pigskin, but the ball rolled<br />\nout of bounds for a Terror first<br />\ndown on the ten. Two plays<br />\nlater. Bricker escaped the first<br />\npass rush and hit Keefer in the<br />\nleft corner of the end zone for<br />\nthe score. The two point<br />\nconversion failed, leaving<br />\nHopkins in the lead, 7-6.<br />\nUnable to move the Jays on<br />\nthe next series, Thomas punted<br />\nto the Terror 45. Western<br />\nMaryland drove to the Hopkins<br />\nseven where the defense<br />\n'stiffened.

In spite of a<br />\nconfusing, rain-soaked course,<br />\nHopkins runners finished well.<br />\nJeff Greve finished third, nursing<br />\nan injured foot throughout the<br />\nentire 5.2 mile race. He was<br />\nfollowed by Frank Van Dyke,<br />\nAustin Doyle, and John Tetzlaff,<br />\nall of whom finished within a<br />\ntwo second interval.<br />\nCoach Masken commented,<br />\n\"We ran a fine race, but the<br />\ncourse was so confusing that for<br />\na while all our runners could do<br />\nwas follow theirs in order to stay<br />\non it. Our times and finishes were<br />\naffected, but we were really the<br />\nbetter team.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe final victory of the season<br />\nleft the Blue Jay hL,riers with a<br />\n5-7 won lost record. The other<br />\nvictories were against Loyola,<br />\nLebenon Valley, Dickinson, and<br />\nWashington College. Although<br />\nthis year's team had \"more<br />\nbalance\". they lacked a really<br />\nstrong runner who could<br />\nconsistently break up the<br />\n\"packs\" from the other schools.<br />\nThe is somewhat compensated<br />\nfor by the fact that this year's<br />\nteam is a young one led by<br />\nsophomor .

After a<br />\nthree year lay off following high<br />\nschool he ran well throughout<br />\nthe year. His coach said,\"He was<br />\na great addition to the team and<br />\nhe ran well all year. It's hard to<br />\n<br />\ncome back after -a three year<br />\nlayoff. If He'd been out 'for the<br />\nteam each year he was here he<br />\nwould have been a far better<br />\nrunner, maybe even the number<br />\none man.\" This success story left<br />\nthe coach wondering how many<br />\nmore talented runners there are<br />\nat Hopkins who just never go out<br />\nfor the team.<br />\nIn a long range look into the<br />\nfuture Coach Masken expects<br />\nnext year's team to be a solid<br />\none. Although this year's team<br />\nwas better than last year's, most<br />\nof the competition had also<br />\nimproved.<br />\nSecond Thoughts<br />\nHe does, however, have some<br />\nsecond thoughts. Of the seven<br />\ncross country lettermen last year,<br />\nonly three returned. This year<br />\nthere will be at least seven more<br />\nlettermen, but the number of<br />\nthem that return and the number<br />\nthat are still interested by next<br />\nseason is something which cannot<br />\nbe foretold.<br />\n<br />\nfollowed (with a quick kick by<br />\nPat Neary thrown in). With less<br />\nthan three minutes left in the<br />\nhalf. Hopkins started on its 37<br />\nand drove tothe Terror 13 where<br />\nThomas attempted a 30 yard<br />\nfield goal. The kick hooked wide<br />\nto the left, and Western Maryland<br />\nran out the clock to take a 9-7<br />\nlead into the locker room at<br />\nKowalchuk scores<br />\nPhil Alba returned the second<br />\nhalf kick-off 15 yards to the 28.<br />\nOn the next play, he sliced up<br />\nthe middle for six, followed by<br />\nThomas with an 18 yard gain<br />\naround left end. Two plays later.<br />\nDoyle ripped for seven, theif<br />\nAlba for six and another first<br />\ndown. Thomas then hit Shevchik<br />\non a down and out for nine,<br />\nwhich Doyle followed on a<br />\ncounter for seven more. Alter<br />\nThomas carried for two yards,<br />\nDoyle lugged the ball three<br />\nstraight fillies to the four yard<br />\nline. From there, Thomas fired to<br />\nhis favorite target, Rick<br />\nKowalchuk, for the score. The<br />\nensuing kick was off to the right,<br />\nleaving I lopk ins with a 13-9 lead.<br />\nThe Terrors could not move<br />\nagainst the fired up Blue Jay<br />\n.defense and were forced to punt.<br />\n.Three plays later, Western<br />\nMaryland intercepted and<br />\nreturned the ball to the Blue Jay<br />\n27. Bricker carried twice for four<br />\nand 11 yards. On the second run,<br />\nhe was smeared by Craig \"The<br />\nCat\" Stevens and coughed up the<br />\nball. Defensive end Ron Hall and<br />\nhalf the Hopkins defensive unit<br />\ncovered the ball on the 23 yard<br />\nline.<br />\nOn first down, Alba was<br />\nstopped for no gain by<br />\nmuscleman Odd Haugen (former<br />\nMr. Norway). Thomas then<br />\ntossed a short flare pass to Rick<br />\nKowalchuk in the right flat.<br />\nKowalchuk turned it into a 14<br />\nyard gain by breaking three<br />\ntackles and carrying three<br />\n.defenders on his back for the last<br />\nfive yards. Alba swept left for 20,<br />\nDoyle smashed up the middle for<br />\nthree followed by Ferguson up<br />\nthe middle for 14 tough yards.<br />\nAfter Nolan gained two on a<br />\nsweep to the left, Kowalchuk<br />\nhauled in another Thomas pass<br />\nfor a six yard gain, making it<br />\nthird and two from the 18.<br />\nWith the ball on the right hash<br />\nmark, Thomas called . _a. double<br />\nreverse with Alba lining up as the<br />\nflanker on the left. The play<br />\n<br />\nworked so well that Alba had<br />\nfour blockers in front of him to<br />\nwipe out the one Terror defender<br />\nwho didn't go for the fake. With<br />\nthe point after, the score rose to<br />\n20-9.<br />\nWestern Maryland could not<br />\nmove the ball and again punted.<br />\nThe ball rolled dead on the Blue<br />\nJay three as the third quarter<br />\nended.<br />\nFrom the three, Hopkins could<br />\nnot move the ball, so Thomas<br />\npunted to the Blue Jay 38. On<br />\nfirst down, Stevens blitzed from<br />\nhis linebacker position and belted<br />\nBricker to the turf for a 17 yard<br />\nloss. Unable to muster a first<br />\ndown, the Terrors lost the ball on<br />\ndowns at the Hopkins 43.<br />\nFumble<br />\nHopkins drove to the Terror<br />\n23 but the drive stalled and<br />\nWestern Maryland took over on<br />\nthe 28.

It<br />\nwas the fiftieth meeting of the<br />\ntwo teams in the rivalry which<br />\ndates back to 1894. Entering the<br />\ngame, Hopkins held a slim lead in<br />\nthe series, 24 victories to 21 for<br />\nthe Terrors, with four ties. The<br />\nTerrors were out to avenge their<br />\n14-13 loss to the Blue Jays last<br />\nyear which cost them the league<br />\nchampionship.<br />\nHopkins kicked off to the<br />\nhosts who returned the ball to<br />\ntheir 32. After three first downs<br />\nhad moved the ball to the Blue<br />\nJay 27, linebacker Craig Stevens<br />\nthwarted the Terror effort with<br />\nan interception at the 24.<br />\nThree plays later, quarterback<br />\nJack Thomas hit senior wide<br />\n, receiver Grant Shevchik with a<br />\n44 yard strike that advanced the<br />\nball to the Terror 28. Bill Nolan<br /><br />\ngained 16 yards on a sweep to<br />\nthe left, but the drive was halted<br />\nwhen Jerry Downes intercepted<br />\nThomas in the end zone and ran<br />\nthe ball out to the eight.<br />\nThree running plays gained<br />\neight yards for the Terrors. On<br />\nfourth down, punter Nelson<br />\nShaffer attempted a pass which,<br />\nluckily for Hopkins, fell<br />\nincomplete giving the Blue Jays<br />\npossession on the Terror 15 yard<br />\nline.<br />\nCarries by Nolan, halfback<br />\nTim Doyle, and senior fullback<br />\nJim Ferguson advanced the ball<br />\nto the one. On third down.<br />\nThomas scored on a quarterback<br />\nsneak, with his conversion<br />\nmaking the score 7-0.<br />\nAfter an exchange of punts,<br />\nthe quarter ended with Western<br />\nMaryland on the Hopkins 43. On<br />\nthe first play of the second<br />\nquarter, Terror quarterback Mike<br />\nBricker hit tight end Andy<br />\nKeefer for 22 yards and a first<br /><br />\nJack Thomas rolls right preparing to pass<br /><br />\n:t<br />\nPhil Alba starts his charge behind a wall of block,ers<br />\ndown.

Several members of the<br />\ndefensive unit had a shot at the<br />\nrolling pigskin, but the ball rolled<br />\nout of bounds for a Terror first<br />\ndown on the ten. Two plays<br />\nlater. Bricker escaped the first<br />\npass rush and hit Keefer in the<br />\nleft corner of the end zone for<br />\nthe score. The two point<br />\nconversion failed, leaving<br />\nHopkins in the lead, 7-6.<br />\nUnable to move the Jays on<br />\nthe next series, Thomas punted<br />\nto the Terror 45.

In spite of a<br />\nconfusing, rain-soaked course,<br />\nHopkins runners finished well.<br />\nJeff Greve finished third, nursing<br />\nan injured foot throughout the<br />\nentire 5.2 mile race. He was<br />\nfollowed by Frank Van Dyke,<br />\nAustin Doyle, and John Tetzlaff,<br />\nall of whom finished within a<br />\ntwo second interval.<br />\nCoach Masken commented,<br />\n\"We ran a fine race, but the<br />\ncourse was so confusing that for<br />\na while all our runners could do<br />\nwas follow theirs in order to stay<br />\non it. Our times and finishes were<br />\naffected, but we were really the<br />\nbetter team.\"<br /><br />\nThe final victory of the season<br />\nleft the Blue Jay hL,riers with a<br />\n5-7 won lost record. The other<br />\nvictories were against Loyola,<br />\nLebenon Valley, Dickinson, and<br />\nWashington College. Although<br />\nthis year's team had \"more<br />\nbalance\". they lacked a really<br />\nstrong runner who could<br />\nconsistently break up the<br />\n\"packs\" from the other schools.<br />\nThe is somewhat compensated<br />\nfor by the fact that this year's<br />\nteam is a young one led by<br />\nsophomor .

After a<br />\nthree year lay off following high<br />\nschool he ran well throughout<br />\nthe year. His coach said,\"He was<br />\na great addition to the team and<br />\nhe ran well all year. It's hard to<br /><br />\ncome back after -a three year<br />\nlayoff. If He'd been out 'for the<br />\nteam each year he was here he<br />\nwould have been a far better<br />\nrunner, maybe even the number<br />\none man.\" This success story left<br />\nthe coach wondering how many<br />\nmore talented runners there are<br />\nat Hopkins who just never go out<br />\nfor the team.<br />\nIn a long range look into the<br />\nfuture Coach Masken expects<br />\nnext year's team to be a solid<br />\none. Although this year's team<br />\nwas better than last year's, most<br />\nof the competition had also<br />\nimproved.<br />\nSecond Thoughts<br />\nHe does, however, have some<br />\nsecond thoughts. Of the seven<br />\ncross country lettermen last year,<br />\nonly three returned. This year<br />\nthere will be at least seven more<br />\nlettermen, but the number of<br />\nthem that return and the number<br />\nthat are still interested by next<br />\nseason is something which cannot<br />\nbe foretold.<br /><br />\nfollowed (with a quick kick by<br />\nPat Neary thrown in). With less<br />\nthan three minutes left in the<br />\nhalf. Hopkins started on its 37<br />\nand drove tothe Terror 13 where<br />\nThomas attempted a 30 yard<br />\nfield goal. The kick hooked wide<br />\nto the left, and Western Maryland<br />\nran out the clock to take a 9-7<br />\nlead into the locker room at<br />\nKowalchuk scores<br />\nPhil Alba returned the second<br />\nhalf kick-off 15 yards to the 28.<br />\nOn the next play, he sliced up<br />\nthe middle for six, followed by<br />\nThomas with an 18 yard gain<br />\naround left end. Two plays later.<br />\nDoyle ripped for seven, theif<br />\nAlba for six and another first<br />\ndown. Thomas then hit Shevchik<br />\non a down and out for nine,<br />\nwhich Doyle followed on a<br />\ncounter for seven more. Alter<br />\nThomas carried for two yards,<br />\nDoyle lugged the ball three<br />\nstraight fillies to the four yard<br />\nline. From there, Thomas fired to<br />\nhis favorite target, Rick<br />\nKowalchuk, for the score. The<br />\nensuing kick was off to the right,<br />\nleaving I lopk ins with a 13-9 lead.<br />\nThe Terrors could not move<br />\nagainst the fired up Blue Jay<br />\n.defense and were forced to punt.<br />\n.Three plays later, Western<br />\nMaryland intercepted and<br />\nreturned the ball to the Blue Jay<br />\n27. Bricker carried twice for four<br />\nand 11 yards. On the second run,<br />\nhe was smeared by Craig \"The<br />\nCat\" Stevens and coughed up the<br />\nball. Defensive end Ron Hall and<br />\nhalf the Hopkins defensive unit<br />\ncovered the ball on the 23 yard<br />\nline.<br />\nOn first down, Alba was<br />\nstopped for no gain by<br />\nmuscleman Odd Haugen (former<br />\nMr. Norway). Thomas then<br />\ntossed a short flare pass to Rick<br />\nKowalchuk in the right flat.<br />\nKowalchuk turned it into a 14<br />\nyard gain by breaking three<br />\ntackles and carrying three<br />\n.defenders on his back for the last<br />\nfive yards. Alba swept left for 20,<br />\nDoyle smashed up the middle for<br />\nthree followed by Ferguson up<br />\nthe middle for 14 tough yards.<br />\nAfter Nolan gained two on a<br />\nsweep to the left, Kowalchuk<br />\nhauled in another Thomas pass<br />\nfor a six yard gain, making it<br />\nthird and two from the 18.<br />\nWith the ball on the right hash<br />\nmark, Thomas called . _a. double<br />\nreverse with Alba lining up as the<br />\nflanker on the left. The play<br /><br />\nworked so well that Alba had<br />\nfour blockers in front of him to<br />\nwipe out the one Terror defender<br />\nwho didn't go for the fake. With<br />\nthe point after, the score rose to<br />\n20-9.<br />\nWestern Maryland could not<br />\nmove the ball and again punted.<br />\nThe ball rolled dead on the Blue<br />\nJay three as the third quarter<br />\nended.<br />\nFrom the three, Hopkins could<br />\nnot move the ball, so Thomas<br />\npunted to the Blue Jay 38. On<br />\nfirst down, Stevens blitzed from<br />\nhis linebacker position and belted<br />\nBricker to the turf for a 17 yard<br />\nloss. Unable to muster a first<br />\ndown, the Terrors lost the ball on<br />\ndowns at the Hopkins 43.<br />\nFumble<br />\nHopkins drove to the Terror<br />\n23 but the drive stalled and<br />\nWestern Maryland took over on<br />\nthe 28. After one first down, the<br />\nTerrors punted to a very nervous<br />\nfreshman, Tom Cirillo. Cirillo<br />\nfumbled with Western Maryland<br />\nrecovering on the 19 yard line.<br />\nOn the next play, senior<br />\nsafetyman Les Matthews was<br />\ncalled for pass interference on<br />\nthe ten. After two plays gained<br />\nonly two yards, Bricker<br />\nattempted to hit Keefer on a<br />\ndown and out to the right.<br />\nInstead, Matthews cut in front,<br />\npicked off the ball in the end<br />\n/one, and headed uplield.
