Since man has<br />\nlost control of scientific media which he<br />\ndeveloped and thus jeopardizes his life,<br />\nhe is now forced to muster his highest<br />\nintelligence, consult world public opinion<br />\nand regain his moral senses in establishing a direct relationship and consciousness between himself, his destiny and<br />\nworld peace. And all this to devise a<br />\nmoral and political solution to the nuclear<br />\nthreats.<br />\nIn words more persuasive than his<br />\nargument, Norman Cousins, editor of the<br />\nSaturday Review, thus stated the \"challenge of our life.\" But he left himself<br />\nopen to criticism as a well-rehearsed<br />\nmoral advocate for nuclear tests' suspension: although not a political fool, Mr.<br />\nCousins is unrealistic.<br />\nOf Mr. Cousins' statement of the<br />\n\"challenge\", we would dispute only three<br />\naspect., He calls for the appeal to world<br />\npublic opinion. Secondly, he calls for the<br />\nissuing of a Declaration of Conscience<br />\nbased on Albert Schweitzer's document of<br />\nthe same, consultation with non-nuclear<br />\npowers before detonating weapons so as<br />\n.not to contaminate \"innocents\", and,<br />\nfinally, a world government capable of<br />\nenforcing a real pecae (not a \"Cold War\"<br />\none) and a foundation for world justice<br />\nbased on international federalism. Mr.<br />\nCousins is a species of the World Federation genre and a Wilsonian believer<br />\nin the effects of World Public Opinion.<br />\nThirdly, Mr. Cousins says the nationstate system is passe and no longer<br />\nfulfills its traditional role of preserving the peace and institutions of a<br />\ngiven people or nation.<br />\n<br />\nopinion with it, if national interests<br />\ndeviate or are mutually antagonistic. It<br />\nis not far wrong to say that the existence<br />\nof world public opinion is fortuitous, at<br />\nbest.<br />\nThe creation of effective and centralized world governemnt requires the<br />\nabolition of the concept of national sovereignity. All past attempts at effective<br />\nworld government, either by all-inclusive,<br />\nopen-end organizations like the United<br />\nNations, or the World Court, or multilateral regional or functional pacts for<br />\ndefense and economic benefits, or multior bi-lateral treaties, have failed to be<br />\nbinding and effective because signatory<br />\nnations have insisted on attaching loophole provisions or qualifying conditions,<br />\nsuch as\" . in all instances of domestic<br />\nmatters, the signatory state reserves the<br />\nright to abstain from the conditions<br />\n...\" of the pact or treaty. Mutual suspicion and desires to protect from foreignnation encroachment all matters of national security underlie these reservations<br />\nand qualifications. In short, a nation is<br />\nunwilling to substitute the obligation to<br />\ndo as other nations require for the freedom to do as it sees fit in matters of<br />\nThe<br />\nnational or international policy.<br />\nconcept of sovereignty limits and makes<br />\nineffective world federalism, the pipedream of those few who look above<br />\nnational self-interest to all-nation concerts.<br />\nTo the reluctance of nations to sacrifice their sovereignty must be added the<br />\nconcept of nationalism as another obstacle to world federalism, which, as just<br />\nnoted, implies supra-nationalism, i.e., a<br />\nunity and concert of all nationalisms.<br />\n<br />\nThis hope of supra-nationalism is<br />\nuniquely impossible of attainment as long<br />\nas vestiges of national allegiance exist.<br />\nIf the nation-state system no longer<br />\nfulfills its traditional role, why then is<br />\nThe appeal to world public opinion is the American Congress so intent on comreally an appeal to the combined opinions bating world communism at home and<br />\nof the several nations most influential in<br />\nabroad?<br />\ninternational politics. What counts for<br />\nMr. Cousins is persuasive at best,<br />\neffectiveness, then, is national public<br />\nopinion. If the national pubic opinion speaks for a felt need and popular sentiof two or more states happen to coincide ment, and is truly idealistic, Should he<br />\non an issue, it is merely because their ever find the way of eliminating the<br />\nnational polftics are compatible in one obstacles we have suggested or of making<br />\ninstance.

Wear a dagger instead, or, for<br />\nformal occasions, a bowie knife.<br />\nLet us turn now to a persistent rumor that a garment called the \"suit\" is on the verge of making a<br />\ncomeback. Some of you older students may remember<br />\nthis \"suit.\" It was an ensemble consisting of a jacket<br />\nand trousers, both of which\u2014this'll kill you\u2014both of<br />\nwhich were made out of the same material!<br />\nThe last \"suit\" ever seen on an American campus<br />\nwas in 1941\u2014and I ought to know because I was<br />\nwearing it. I was an undergraduate then, and in love<br />\n\u2014hopelessly in love with a beauteous statistics major<br />\nnamed Harry Sigafoos. (She is one of the two girls I<br />\nhave ever known named Harry. The other one is her<br />\nsister.)<br />\nI loved Harry madly, though her expensive tastes<br />\nwere the ruin of me. Bit by bit I sold off my belongings to pursue this costly courtship\u2014first my books,<br />\nthen my clothes, until finally I was left with nothing<br />\nto wear but a \"suit\". One night I came calling for her<br />\nin this garment and she, of course, slashed me across<br />\nthe face with a riding crop and sent me from her door.<br />\nI slunk home and lit a Marlboro and sat down to<br />\nthink. I always light a Marlboro when I sit down to<br />\nthink, for their good mild flavor is a great aid to cerebration. I always light a Marlboro when I don't sit<br />\ndown to think, too, because Marlboro is my favorite<br />\ncigarette, and I.know it will be yours, too, once you<br />\nmake the acquaintance of that filter, that flavor, that<br />\nfliptop box. As the man says, you get a lot to like with<br />\na Marlboro.<br />\nWell, sirs, smoking and thinking thus, my eye happened to fall on an ad in a campus newspaper which<br />\nsaid: \"WIN A COMPLETE WARDROBE!

And most of those<br />\nParticipating have been fraternity men.<br />\nIf electing freshmen for a four year term on the Board<br />\nIS responsible for the members' feeling of complacency,<br />\nWe question the advisability of such a practice.

Since man has<br />\nlost control of scientific media which he<br />\ndeveloped and thus jeopardizes his life,<br />\nhe is now forced to muster his highest<br />\nintelligence, consult world public opinion<br />\nand regain his moral senses in establishing a direct relationship and consciousness between himself, his destiny and<br />\nworld peace. And all this to devise a<br />\nmoral and political solution to the nuclear<br />\nthreats.<br />\nIn words more persuasive than his<br />\nargument, Norman Cousins, editor of the<br />\nSaturday Review, thus stated the \"challenge of our life.\" But he left himself<br />\nopen to criticism as a well-rehearsed<br />\nmoral advocate for nuclear tests' suspension: although not a political fool, Mr.<br />\nCousins is unrealistic.<br />\nOf Mr. Cousins' statement of the<br />\n\"challenge\", we would dispute only three<br />\naspect., He calls for the appeal to world<br />\npublic opinion. Secondly, he calls for the<br />\nissuing of a Declaration of Conscience<br />\nbased on Albert Schweitzer's document of<br />\nthe same, consultation with non-nuclear<br />\npowers before detonating weapons so as<br />\n.not to contaminate \"innocents\", and,<br />\nfinally, a world government capable of<br />\nenforcing a real pecae (not a \"Cold War\"<br />\none) and a foundation for world justice<br />\nbased on international federalism. Mr.<br />\nCousins is a species of the World Federation genre and a Wilsonian believer<br />\nin the effects of World Public Opinion.<br />\nThirdly, Mr. Cousins says the nationstate system is passe and no longer<br />\nfulfills its traditional role of preserving the peace and institutions of a<br />\ngiven people or nation.<br /><br />\nopinion with it, if national interests<br />\ndeviate or are mutually antagonistic. It<br />\nis not far wrong to say that the existence<br />\nof world public opinion is fortuitous, at<br />\nbest.<br />\nThe creation of effective and centralized world governemnt requires the<br />\nabolition of the concept of national sovereignity. All past attempts at effective<br />\nworld government, either by all-inclusive,<br />\nopen-end organizations like the United<br />\nNations, or the World Court, or multilateral regional or functional pacts for<br />\ndefense and economic benefits, or multior bi-lateral treaties, have failed to be<br />\nbinding and effective because signatory<br />\nnations have insisted on attaching loophole provisions or qualifying conditions,<br />\nsuch as\" . in all instances of domestic<br />\nmatters, the signatory state reserves the<br />\nright to abstain from the conditions<br />\n...\" of the pact or treaty. Mutual suspicion and desires to protect from foreignnation encroachment all matters of national security underlie these reservations<br />\nand qualifications. In short, a nation is<br />\nunwilling to substitute the obligation to<br />\ndo as other nations require for the freedom to do as it sees fit in matters of<br />\nThe<br />\nnational or international policy.<br />\nconcept of sovereignty limits and makes<br />\nineffective world federalism, the pipedream of those few who look above<br />\nnational self-interest to all-nation concerts.<br />\nTo the reluctance of nations to sacrifice their sovereignty must be added the<br />\nconcept of nationalism as another obstacle to world federalism, which, as just<br />\nnoted, implies supra-nationalism, i.e., a<br />\nunity and concert of all nationalisms.<br /><br />\nThis hope of supra-nationalism is<br />\nuniquely impossible of attainment as long<br />\nas vestiges of national allegiance exist.<br />\nIf the nation-state system no longer<br />\nfulfills its traditional role, why then is<br />\nThe appeal to world public opinion is the American Congress so intent on comreally an appeal to the combined opinions bating world communism at home and<br />\nof the several nations most influential in<br />\nabroad?<br />\ninternational politics. What counts for<br />\nMr. Cousins is persuasive at best,<br />\neffectiveness, then, is national public<br />\nopinion. If the national pubic opinion speaks for a felt need and popular sentiof two or more states happen to coincide ment, and is truly idealistic, Should he<br />\non an issue, it is merely because their ever find the way of eliminating the<br />\nnational polftics are compatible in one obstacles we have suggested or of making<br />\ninstance.

Today we will do the same for college men.<br />\nThe most important thing to remember, gentlemen,<br />\nis to dress with verve, with dash, with inventiveness.<br />\nDon't be imprisoned by the traditional conservatism<br />\nof men's clothing. Brighten up your appearance with<br />\na single earring, or a cavalry saber, or a gold derby.<br /><br />\n61131idita.1161/ 671lcilidS3<br />\nHowever, guard against gaudiness. If, for instance,<br />\nyou are wearing a gold derby,do not also wear a cavalry<br />\nsaber. This is too much. Wear a dagger instead, or, for<br />\nformal occasions, a bowie knife.<br />\nLet us turn now to a persistent rumor that a garment called the \"suit\" is on the verge of making a<br />\ncomeback. Some of you older students may remember<br />\nthis \"suit.\" It was an ensemble consisting of a jacket<br />\nand trousers, both of which\u2014this'll kill you\u2014both of<br />\nwhich were made out of the same material!<br />\nThe last \"suit\" ever seen on an American campus<br />\nwas in 1941\u2014and I ought to know because I was<br />\nwearing it. I was an undergraduate then, and in love<br />\n\u2014hopelessly in love with a beauteous statistics major<br />\nnamed Harry Sigafoos. (She is one of the two girls I<br />\nhave ever known named Harry. The other one is her<br />\nsister.)<br />\nI loved Harry madly, though her expensive tastes<br />\nwere the ruin of me. Bit by bit I sold off my belongings to pursue this costly courtship\u2014first my books,<br />\nthen my clothes, until finally I was left with nothing<br />\nto wear but a \"suit\". One night I came calling for her<br />\nin this garment and she, of course, slashed me across<br />\nthe face with a riding crop and sent me from her door.<br />\nI slunk home and lit a Marlboro and sat down to<br />\nthink. I always light a Marlboro when I sit down to<br />\nthink, for their good mild flavor is a great aid to cerebration. I always light a Marlboro when I don't sit<br />\ndown to think, too, because Marlboro is my favorite<br />\ncigarette, and I.know it will be yours, too, once you<br />\nmake the acquaintance of that filter, that flavor, that<br />\nfliptop box. As the man says, you get a lot to like with<br />\na Marlboro.<br />\nWell, sirs, smoking and thinking thus, my eye happened to fall on an ad in a campus newspaper which<br />\nsaid: \"WIN A COMPLETE WARDROBE! Touhy's<br />\nToggery, the campus's leading men's store, announces<br />\na contest to pick the best-dressed man on campus. The<br />\nwinner will receive absolutely free a complete new<br />\nwardrobe!\"<br />\nStruck by a sudden inspiration, I took pen in hand<br />\nand wrote a letter to Mr. Touhy of Touhy's Toggery:<br />\n\"Sir\u2014I see by the paper that you are giving a complete new wardrobe to the best-dressed man on campus. What a ridiculous idea!<br />\n\"Obviously, to be the best-dressed man on campus,<br />\nyou must first have a lot of clothes, and if you have a<br />\nlot of clothes, what do you need with another wardrobe?<br />\n\"Touhy's Toggery should give a new wardrobe to<br />\nthe worst-dressed man on campus.

Said<br />\nletter, written by a Goucherite,<br />\nrather clearly demonstrates a<br />\nvictim's attitude toward these<br />\n\"thoughtless disturbers- of the<br />\npeace\".<br />\nThe Goucherite, with true<br />\nfeminine perversity, liked invasion of her privacy and was upset<br />\nthat the press had incorrectly<br />\ncalled the sortie \"a failure\".<br />\nWe may have had destructive<br />\nriots in the past, but what, pray<br />\ntell, is all the fuss about this<br />\nyear?

And most of those<br />\nParticipating have been fraternity men.<br />\nIf electing freshmen for a four year term on the Board<br />\nIS responsible for the members' feeling of complacency,<br />\nWe question the advisability of such a practice.
