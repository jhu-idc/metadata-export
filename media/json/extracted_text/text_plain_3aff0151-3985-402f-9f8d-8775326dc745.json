We<br />\nwill not dispute the obvious fact that a large measure of<br />\nwhat makes the Undergraduate school unique is the attitudes that are transmitted from the Graduate division.<br />\nNevertheless, it is vital that the Administration<br />\nmake some distinctions between its student bodies. At<br />\nthe most basic level, the Administration must realize<br />\nthat most concerns to which Undergraduates direct themselves are extra-academic. Therefore it is imperative<br />\nihat we balance academic efficiency with the maintenance<br />\nof a psychological climate conducive to learning.<br />\nIt is axiomatic that any University offer its students<br />\nflexibility. Before effecting the current system, Hopkins<br />\nnot only offered flexibility but a system of options whereby a student was permitted to \"give up\" without incurring punishment. He was permitted to experience<br />\ntacit rather than actual failure and thus was permitted<br />\nto learn something from the experience.<br />\n\"Nothing,\" Bob Dylan once said \"succeeds like<br />\nfailure.\" It is important that the Administration realize<br />\nthat it is dealing with people. People only fail when<br />\nthey are trapped without the opportunity to change their<br />\nminds. Failure only leads to failure. If it is the Administration's intention to reduce the size of the Undergraduate student body, then it has undertaken a masterful plan.<br />\nBut if it believes that we, as prospective real people,<br />\nstand to learn as much from failure as success, it will<br />\nreverse its present policy before it does irreparable harm<br />\nto even one student.<br />\n<br />\nFraternities Rushed<br />\nWhile the News-Letter hardly sympathizes with<br />\nGeorge P. Mahoney's contention that \"A man's home is<br />\nhis castle,\" we nevertheless are becoming convinced that<br />\na Hopkins man's apartment or fraternity house, if located southeast of the campus, must, of necessity, be a<br />\nfortress.<br />\nFor years now, it has been the summer pastime<br />\nfor neighborhood toughs to ransack and loot fraternity<br />\nhouses, with little recource available to the agrieved<br />\nbrothers. During the school year, the local billies have<br />\nsimilarly shown little reluctance to enter the residences<br />\nof Hopkins students, peacefully or otherwise.<br />\nLast year, a gang invaded the apartment of four<br />\nHopkins men near 27th and St. Paul Streets, and were<br />\nrepelled only when confronted with a shotgun. The knifewielding incident at 29th and Calvert last Friday night<br />\nis another case in point. And during the rush season,<br />\nevery fraternity house at one time or another is visited<br />\nby local youths who inevitably get drunk and obstinately<br />\nrefuse to leave quietly.<br />\nThe University administration, although intensely<br />\nmindful of retaining a favorable Hopkins public image,<br />\nhas still gone to considerable lengths to give fraternities<br />\nand individuals the freedom they so greatly desire, especially in the matter of drinking. It has attempted, with<br />\noccasional success, to have the Baltimore police adopt<br />\nthis outlook, also. Having encouraged the local constabulary to look the other way in one matter, the fraternities now register their anger and amazement when<br />\nthe police hesitate to exert themselves to the utmost to<br />\ncurtail the activities of the neighborhood juvenile delinquents.<br />\nThe problem is compounded by the city's notorious lack of police personnel, the inability of the average<br />\nBaltimore cop to recognize that two wrongs don't make<br />\na right, and the fact that the many Hopkins people not<br />\nin fraternities, but residing in the area, are victims of<br />\nan antagonistic police attiude of whose creation they had<br />\nno part.<br />\nWe hope that, when the I.F.C. president meets<br />\nwith a representative of the Baltimore police next week,<br />\nthese problems will be frankly discussed and that some<br />\nadequate solution can be achieved.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 7, 1966<br />\n<br />\nSweetie Pie<br />\n<br />\nOpen Housing in a Closed Society.<br />\nMaryland Democrats voted ride buses often, you may be the subsequen<br />\nt tension of white<br />\ntrue to form last month, choos- astonished at the paucity of home owners<br />\nand real estate<br />\ning George P.

I firmly believe that the problem and<br />\nburden which confront both our<br />\nsense of justice and our pocketbooks, the inadequacy of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Bookstore, must<br />\nnow be faced in this spirit.<br />\nEvery person connected academically with our university is<br />\npersonally touched by this problem. In my mind it is twofold:<br />\nfirst, there is an inadequacy in<br />\nspace, service, and atmosphere<br />\nwhich Makes it distasteful to<br />\neven enter the bookstore; and<br />\nsecondly, there is an exorbitant<br />\nprofit made on each and every<br />\nbook and off of each and every<br />\npurchaser.<br />\nWe have been told that the<br />\ncrowded conditions will be alleviated when the renovation of<br />\nGilman Hall is complete (although one professor makes the<br />\npoint that\\he hardly sees where<br />\nthe bookstore will have room to<br />\nexpand what with all they plan<br />\nto put in the building). Yet this<br />\nis but a partial solution. Will we<br />\nstill have to stand in line for<br />\nforty minutes only to find that<br />\nthe essential book has not arrived? Will we still have to<br />\nsearch painfully for an object<br />\nthat is hidden in some obscure<br />\ncorner? What atmosphere will<br />\nbe present? Perhaps the answers<br />\nto some of these questions could<br />\nbe found in a summer mailing of<br />\nbooklists so that students could<br />\nbuy elsewhere or bring books from<br />\n<br />\nhome, in a lounging area where<br />\npurchasers could sit and browse,<br />\nin self-service shelves for textbooks, or in the selling of cultural objects such as prints and.<br />\nrecords.<br />\nIf these \"aesthetic\" issues<br />\nseem essential, think for a moment about the economic concerns. A rumor (supposedly SUb\u2014<br />\nstantiated by the report of the<br />\nLong Range Planning Committee) claims that the bookstore's<br />\nyearly profit can be approximated at $25,000 which is then<br />\nsupposedly directed to some obscure or abstract use which helps<br />\nthe student body.

Stop<br />\nphotography, for instance, was<br />\nused rather simply in a sequence<br />\nin Darling to capture poses used<br />\nas photographs later in the story.<br />\nA more refined use of stop photography was a shot in the recent Russian short, A Ballad of<br />\nLove. The camera captured and<br />\nheld for several seconds the expression of astonishment on the<br />\nboy's face when he discovered<br />\nthat the girl was a deaf mute.<br />\n<br />\ndevoted to and supported solely<br />\nby noise and spectacle, with little or no thought given to theme.<br />\nThe appeal to the universal human condition, the search for<br />\nspiritual values and the development of tradition, while appearing even in poor novels, are<br />\nhardly touched upon in most<br />\nAmerican films.<br />\nUltimately, it seems that artistry will flourish on the American<br />\nscreen only when the audience<br />\n<br />\nAnother technique which<br />\nsometimes proves to be more difficult is a shuffled time sequence.<br />\nA movie like Dear John seems<br />\nto require more than one viewing in order to synthesize the<br />\nbroken time sequence. This may<br />\nbe an unnecessary demand on<br />\nthe viewer, but then again, such<br />\na technique, if properly used, can<br />\nbe just as effective on film as<br />\nFaulkner's literary manipulation<br />\nof time.<br />\nBorrowing another technique<br />\nfrom the novel, a good movie<br />\ncan make excellent use of color<br />\nsymbolism. Antonioni's Red Desert is one example. But black<br />\nand white is still an effective<br />\nmedium for pictures which demand a stark realism, such as<br />\nThe Pawnbroker, or a bitterness<br />\nand bleakness, such as The Spy<br />\nWho Came In From the Cold.<br />\n<br />\nhas developed the sensitivity to<br />\nreceive it. On this point, Valenti<br />\nhas high hopes: \"The next creative center will be here. We are<br />\neducating an audience that will<br />\nnot accept the ordinary. We want<br />\nthe world to look at America and<br />\nsay, 'By golly, those Americans<br />\nare really doing something.\" And<br />\nhis hopes, it seems could be fulfilled by a serious Hollywood<br />\nwhich would give the public<br />\nsome artistic exposure. Holly-<br />\n<br />\nwood will do this when it sees<br />\naudiences not as a horde of dolJar signs, but as a group of individuals who can both laugh and<br />\n<br />\nweep during The Shop on Main<br />\nStreet, and feel the throb that<br />\ncompels Zorba the Greek to<br />\ndance.<br />\n<br />\ni -4<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\n.-$\u2022:'.,<br />\n<br />\ng-1111<br />\n<br />\n44<br />\n*44,\u2018 NEW<br />\n0.01*<br />\nfa_<br />\n!<br />\ni<br />\n,<br />\n'<br />\n.<br />\n'<br />\n.<br />\nPENGUINS<br />\n.....,,,1. \u2022Ts%'.1.

We<br />\nwill not dispute the obvious fact that a large measure of<br />\nwhat makes the Undergraduate school unique is the attitudes that are transmitted from the Graduate division.<br />\nNevertheless, it is vital that the Administration<br />\nmake some distinctions between its student bodies. At<br />\nthe most basic level, the Administration must realize<br />\nthat most concerns to which Undergraduates direct themselves are extra-academic. Therefore it is imperative<br />\nihat we balance academic efficiency with the maintenance<br />\nof a psychological climate conducive to learning.<br />\nIt is axiomatic that any University offer its students<br />\nflexibility. Before effecting the current system, Hopkins<br />\nnot only offered flexibility but a system of options whereby a student was permitted to \"give up\" without incurring punishment. He was permitted to experience<br />\ntacit rather than actual failure and thus was permitted<br />\nto learn something from the experience.<br />\n\"Nothing,\" Bob Dylan once said \"succeeds like<br />\nfailure.\" It is important that the Administration realize<br />\nthat it is dealing with people. People only fail when<br />\nthey are trapped without the opportunity to change their<br />\nminds. Failure only leads to failure. If it is the Administration's intention to reduce the size of the Undergraduate student body, then it has undertaken a masterful plan.<br />\nBut if it believes that we, as prospective real people,<br />\nstand to learn as much from failure as success, it will<br />\nreverse its present policy before it does irreparable harm<br />\nto even one student.<br /><br />\nFraternities Rushed<br />\nWhile the News-Letter hardly sympathizes with<br />\nGeorge P. Mahoney's contention that \"A man's home is<br />\nhis castle,\" we nevertheless are becoming convinced that<br />\na Hopkins man's apartment or fraternity house, if located southeast of the campus, must, of necessity, be a<br />\nfortress.<br />\nFor years now, it has been the summer pastime<br />\nfor neighborhood toughs to ransack and loot fraternity<br />\nhouses, with little recource available to the agrieved<br />\nbrothers. During the school year, the local billies have<br />\nsimilarly shown little reluctance to enter the residences<br />\nof Hopkins students, peacefully or otherwise.<br />\nLast year, a gang invaded the apartment of four<br />\nHopkins men near 27th and St. Paul Streets, and were<br />\nrepelled only when confronted with a shotgun. The knifewielding incident at 29th and Calvert last Friday night<br />\nis another case in point. And during the rush season,<br />\nevery fraternity house at one time or another is visited<br />\nby local youths who inevitably get drunk and obstinately<br />\nrefuse to leave quietly.<br />\nThe University administration, although intensely<br />\nmindful of retaining a favorable Hopkins public image,<br />\nhas still gone to considerable lengths to give fraternities<br />\nand individuals the freedom they so greatly desire, especially in the matter of drinking. It has attempted, with<br />\noccasional success, to have the Baltimore police adopt<br />\nthis outlook, also. Having encouraged the local constabulary to look the other way in one matter, the fraternities now register their anger and amazement when<br />\nthe police hesitate to exert themselves to the utmost to<br />\ncurtail the activities of the neighborhood juvenile delinquents.<br />\nThe problem is compounded by the city's notorious lack of police personnel, the inability of the average<br />\nBaltimore cop to recognize that two wrongs don't make<br />\na right, and the fact that the many Hopkins people not<br />\nin fraternities, but residing in the area, are victims of<br />\nan antagonistic police attiude of whose creation they had<br />\nno part.<br />\nWe hope that, when the I.F.C. president meets<br />\nwith a representative of the Baltimore police next week,<br />\nthese problems will be frankly discussed and that some<br />\nadequate solution can be achieved.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 7, 1966<br /><br />\nSweetie Pie<br /><br />\nOpen Housing in a Closed Society.<br />\nMaryland Democrats voted ride buses often, you may be the subsequen<br />\nt tension of white<br />\ntrue to form last month, choos- astonished at the paucity of home owners<br />\nand real estate<br />\ning George P.

I firmly believe that the problem and<br />\nburden which confront both our<br />\nsense of justice and our pocketbooks, the inadequacy of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Bookstore, must<br />\nnow be faced in this spirit.<br />\nEvery person connected academically with our university is<br />\npersonally touched by this problem. In my mind it is twofold:<br />\nfirst, there is an inadequacy in<br />\nspace, service, and atmosphere<br />\nwhich Makes it distasteful to<br />\neven enter the bookstore; and<br />\nsecondly, there is an exorbitant<br />\nprofit made on each and every<br />\nbook and off of each and every<br />\npurchaser.<br />\nWe have been told that the<br />\ncrowded conditions will be alleviated when the renovation of<br />\nGilman Hall is complete (although one professor makes the<br />\npoint that\\he hardly sees where<br />\nthe bookstore will have room to<br />\nexpand what with all they plan<br />\nto put in the building). Yet this<br />\nis but a partial solution. Will we<br />\nstill have to stand in line for<br />\nforty minutes only to find that<br />\nthe essential book has not arrived? Will we still have to<br />\nsearch painfully for an object<br />\nthat is hidden in some obscure<br />\ncorner? What atmosphere will<br />\nbe present? Perhaps the answers<br />\nto some of these questions could<br />\nbe found in a summer mailing of<br />\nbooklists so that students could<br />\nbuy elsewhere or bring books from<br /><br />\nhome, in a lounging area where<br />\npurchasers could sit and browse,<br />\nin self-service shelves for textbooks, or in the selling of cultural objects such as prints and.<br />\nrecords.<br />\nIf these \"aesthetic\" issues<br />\nseem essential, think for a moment about the economic concerns. A rumor (supposedly SUb\u2014<br />\nstantiated by the report of the<br />\nLong Range Planning Committee) claims that the bookstore's<br />\nyearly profit can be approximated at $25,000 which is then<br />\nsupposedly directed to some obscure or abstract use which helps<br />\nthe student body. It would seem<br />\nto me that some explanation on<br />\nthe part of the administration is<br />\nrequired. But also something<br />\nfurther. Why cannot our bookstore be run with our economic<br />\ncomfort in mind? Why must we<br />\npay list prices and receive inadequate service while students<br />\nat other top universities (undet.<br />\na co-operative or discount program) pay decidedly less?<br />\nI believe that these questions<br />\ncan be answered this year, but<br />\nit will take a united and concerted effort on the part of the<br />\nundergraduates, the graduates,<br />\nthe evening students, and the<br />\nfaculty.

Stop<br />\nphotography, for instance, was<br />\nused rather simply in a sequence<br />\nin Darling to capture poses used<br />\nas photographs later in the story.<br />\nA more refined use of stop photography was a shot in the recent Russian short, A Ballad of<br />\nLove. The camera captured and<br />\nheld for several seconds the expression of astonishment on the<br />\nboy's face when he discovered<br />\nthat the girl was a deaf mute.<br /><br />\ndevoted to and supported solely<br />\nby noise and spectacle, with little or no thought given to theme.<br />\nThe appeal to the universal human condition, the search for<br />\nspiritual values and the development of tradition, while appearing even in poor novels, are<br />\nhardly touched upon in most<br />\nAmerican films.<br />\nUltimately, it seems that artistry will flourish on the American<br />\nscreen only when the audience<br /><br />\nAnother technique which<br />\nsometimes proves to be more difficult is a shuffled time sequence.<br />\nA movie like Dear John seems<br />\nto require more than one viewing in order to synthesize the<br />\nbroken time sequence. This may<br />\nbe an unnecessary demand on<br />\nthe viewer, but then again, such<br />\na technique, if properly used, can<br />\nbe just as effective on film as<br />\nFaulkner's literary manipulation<br />\nof time.<br />\nBorrowing another technique<br />\nfrom the novel, a good movie<br />\ncan make excellent use of color<br />\nsymbolism. Antonioni's Red Desert is one example. But black<br />\nand white is still an effective<br />\nmedium for pictures which demand a stark realism, such as<br />\nThe Pawnbroker, or a bitterness<br />\nand bleakness, such as The Spy<br />\nWho Came In From the Cold.<br /><br />\nhas developed the sensitivity to<br />\nreceive it. On this point, Valenti<br />\nhas high hopes: \"The next creative center will be here. We are<br />\neducating an audience that will<br />\nnot accept the ordinary. We want<br />\nthe world to look at America and<br />\nsay, 'By golly, those Americans<br />\nare really doing something.\" And<br />\nhis hopes, it seems could be fulfilled by a serious Hollywood<br />\nwhich would give the public<br />\nsome artistic exposure. Holly-<br /><br />\nwood will do this when it sees<br />\naudiences not as a horde of dolJar signs, but as a group of individuals who can both laugh and<br /><br />\nweep during The Shop on Main<br />\nStreet, and feel the throb that<br />\ncompels Zorba the Greek to<br />\ndance.<br /><br />\ni -4<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\n.-$\u2022:'.,<br /><br />\ng-1111<br /><br />\n44<br />\n*44,\u2018 NEW<br />\n0.01*<br />\nfa_<br />\n!<br />\ni<br />\n,<br />\n'<br />\n.<br />\n'<br />\n.<br />\nPENGUINS<br />\n.....,,,1. \u2022Ts%'.1.
