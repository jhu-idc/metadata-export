The Sophs, however,<br />\nmanaged to work the ball into<br />\ntheir opponents' territory in the<br />\nsecond period, but had their advance cut short when Barton<br />\nscooped up a fumble and ran to<br />\nthe goal. He was called back,<br />\nhowever, for stepping outside, and<br />\nthe half ended scoreless.<br />\nWith the second half the secondyear men opened up an attack<br />\nthat pushed the Freshies back to<br />\ntheir 20-yard line, but here the<br />\nlower class braced and held for<br />\ndowns. They were soon forced to<br />\npunt, however, and the Sophs came<br />\nback with forward passes from<br />\nDodson to Rogers and Middleton,<br />\nbut could not keep up their advance.<br />\nLate in the final quarter, the<br />\nSophs succeeded in -driving their<br />\nway to the 7-yard line, from<br />\nwhere Rich dodged his way over<br />\nthe line.

The Sophs, however,<br />\nmanaged to work the ball into<br />\ntheir opponents' territory in the<br />\nsecond period, but had their advance cut short when Barton<br />\nscooped up a fumble and ran to<br />\nthe goal. He was called back,<br />\nhowever, for stepping outside, and<br />\nthe half ended scoreless.<br />\nWith the second half the secondyear men opened up an attack<br />\nthat pushed the Freshies back to<br />\ntheir 20-yard line, but here the<br />\nlower class braced and held for<br />\ndowns. They were soon forced to<br />\npunt, however, and the Sophs came<br />\nback with forward passes from<br />\nDodson to Rogers and Middleton,<br />\nbut could not keep up their advance.<br />\nLate in the final quarter, the<br />\nSophs succeeded in -driving their<br />\nway to the 7-yard line, from<br />\nwhere Rich dodged his way over<br />\nthe line. Rogers kicked goal. The<br />\ngame ended with the ball in midfield.<br />\nRich proved to be the real punch<br />\nin the second-year backfield,<br />\nwhile Middleton and Rogers did<br />\ngood work on the ends. Barton,<br />\nHarwood and Coady starred for<br />\nthe Freshmen.<br />\nBetween the halves of the football game the first part of the<br />\nrush was held. The Freshmen<br />\npacked together in the center of<br />\nthe field, those on the outside locking arms, while the Sophs divided<br />\ninto two ,bands ,and prepared -to<br />\nattack from opposite sides. Suddenly \"Peanuts\" Gardner was<br />\nraised above the crowd, banner in<br />\nhand, as suddenly let down again,<br />\nand the fight was on.<br />\nAaronson, clad in what appeared to be a swimming jersey, was<br />\nhurled over the Freshmen's heads<br />\ninto -the center of the throng,<br />\nwhile others followed with a flying leap. Soon the compact mass<br />\nhad broken into a series of individual tussles, but the weenies<br />\nmanaged to retain the banner until<br />\nthe whistle sounded.<br />\nThe second engagement, which<br />\nfollowed the game, seemed to be<br />\ndevoted largely to a methodically<br />\nconducted process of disrobement,<br />\nfor the majority of the shirts on<br />\nthe field soon disappeared, accompanied now and then by other and<br />\nThe<br />\nmore necessary articles.<br />\nFreshmen were gradually separated into two bodies, each<br />\nsurrounded by its quota of<br />\nopponents.
