Inspectors Well<br />\nPleased With Unit.<br />\n<br />\nAfter many false alarms the belated annual inspection of the R. 0.<br />\nT. C. finally took place last Thursday and Friday. The ideal weather<br />\ndrew quite a large crowd and the<br />\nmusic furnished by a band from<br />\nCamp Holabird kept everyone in<br />\ngood spirits. The inspecting officers were: Colonel E. J. Williams,<br />\nGeneral Staff Corps; LieutenantColonel W. R. Gibson, Major General Adelbert Cronkhite and Major<br />\nEarl H. Metzger.<br />\nThe first event on the program<br />\nwas a review, followed by battalion<br />\ninspection. The manual of arms<br />\nand physical drill were performed<br />\nwith perfection and the latter especially made a big hit with the inspectors. The battalion drilled as<br />\na company for a few minutes under<br />\nCadet Major Chisholm and then the<br />\ncompanies were turned over to<br />\ntheir commanders for close and extended order drill. After the drill<br />\nthe students broke up into specialties and the inspectors made a rapid<br />\ntour, taking in the signal squad,<br />\nmodel bridge construction, indoor<br />\nand outdoor gallery fire and the<br />\nwork on automatic rifles, machine<br />\nguns and one-pounders.<br />\nCompany C undertook a difficult<br />\nfield problem and made a great success of it. Lake Montebello was the<br />\nscene of the operations and the company made a successful attack upon<br />\nthe \"enemy's\" outpost line. On Friday the recitation classes in theoretical instruction were heard by the<br />\nvisitors. The behavior of the unit<br />\nduring the inspection was all that<br />\ncould be asked, the drill was scrappy and little, if anything, was<br />\n\"balled up.\" President Goodnow<br />\nand Dean Latane accompanied the<br />\nofficers during the inspection.

Swarthmore then<br />\nbraced and made two goals, one of<br />\nthem being a short shot by Buckma, and the other a hard shot<br />\nthrough a scrimmage in front of<br />\ngoal by Katzenbach..

Each<br />\nman knows that for his own benefit he must get through them to the<br />\nbest of his ability and finish this<br />\nrather trying year with results that<br />\nwill show his best efforts. The<br />\nathletic teams and other undergraduate organizations were greatly<br />\nhampered because much of their<br />\nbest material fell down in the midyears and became \"black-listed,\"<br />\neven in face of the lowering of the<br />\nrequirements by the faculty. Every<br />\nman owes it first to himself to pass<br />\nand pass high, then to the teams,<br />\nclubs and societies of which he is<br />\na member, so that they may contain<br />\nthe best red-blooded Hopkins\u2014enthusiastic men who are here.<br />\nHeaven only knows there is a deplorably small percentage of undergraduates at Hopkins who participate in its non-curriculum activities<br />\nand to have a part of this blacklisted means that Hopkins cannot<br />\nput forth its best. Many of us are<br />\naccustomed to putting off the final<br />\nstudying until the last minute\u2014a<br />\npractice which is never the best in<br />\nthe long run. Hard as it may be to<br />\ngive up such interesting \"classes\"<br />\nas Barn 3 and 4, yet the time devoted to them could well be spent<br />\nnow in reviewing those \"good old<br />\nnotes\" and text books.

Inspectors Well<br />\nPleased With Unit.<br /><br />\nAfter many false alarms the belated annual inspection of the R. 0.<br />\nT. C. finally took place last Thursday and Friday. The ideal weather<br />\ndrew quite a large crowd and the<br />\nmusic furnished by a band from<br />\nCamp Holabird kept everyone in<br />\ngood spirits. The inspecting officers were: Colonel E. J. Williams,<br />\nGeneral Staff Corps; LieutenantColonel W. R. Gibson, Major General Adelbert Cronkhite and Major<br />\nEarl H. Metzger.<br />\nThe first event on the program<br />\nwas a review, followed by battalion<br />\ninspection. The manual of arms<br />\nand physical drill were performed<br />\nwith perfection and the latter especially made a big hit with the inspectors. The battalion drilled as<br />\na company for a few minutes under<br />\nCadet Major Chisholm and then the<br />\ncompanies were turned over to<br />\ntheir commanders for close and extended order drill. After the drill<br />\nthe students broke up into specialties and the inspectors made a rapid<br />\ntour, taking in the signal squad,<br />\nmodel bridge construction, indoor<br />\nand outdoor gallery fire and the<br />\nwork on automatic rifles, machine<br />\nguns and one-pounders.<br />\nCompany C undertook a difficult<br />\nfield problem and made a great success of it. Lake Montebello was the<br />\nscene of the operations and the company made a successful attack upon<br />\nthe \"enemy's\" outpost line. On Friday the recitation classes in theoretical instruction were heard by the<br />\nvisitors. The behavior of the unit<br />\nduring the inspection was all that<br />\ncould be asked, the drill was scrappy and little, if anything, was<br />\n\"balled up.\" President Goodnow<br />\nand Dean Latane accompanied the<br />\nofficers during the inspection.
