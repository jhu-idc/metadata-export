The research<br />\nthat was required to uncover<br />\nmany of these mysteries must<br />\nhave been tremendous.

Torsch, '21, to the Board<br />\nof Associate Editors.<br />\n\"Alec\" Wolfe.<br />\n<br />\nOne more name was added to<br />\nthe long list of Hopkins men in the<br />\nservice, and one more leader was<br />\nlost to the undergraduate student<br />\nbody at Homewood when \"Alec\"<br />\nWolfe\u2014taking leave of his Alma<br />\nMater he has served so faithfully<br />\nfor all but four years\u2014headed for<br />\na ground school of the Naval Aviation Corps. Since last spring we<br />\nhave learned to expect shocks and<br />\nsudden losses, but last week we experienced a sense of loss that bordered closely on a feeling of depair. We knew only too well that<br />\nwe were losing a leader whose<br />\nplace it would be difficult,. if not<br />\nimpossible, to fill. We almost forgot to be proud that he was entering the service of his country, that<br />\nhe was entering a branch of the<br />\nservice in which there was room<br />\nfor only the cream of the nation's<br />\nyouth\u2014into which it was a privilege and an honor to be accepted.<br />\nIf any man at Homewood could<br />\nbe called a student leader, it was<br />\n\"Alec\" Wolfe. As president of the<br />\nHopkins circle of the Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa, as head of the General Athletic Association, and as<br />\ncaptain of the lacrosse team, he<br />\n<br />\nheld as many prominent positions<br />\nas it is physically possible for one<br />\nman to hold down with any degree<br />\nof credit. He won his\"H\" in football last fall, was a member of the<br />\nDebating Council, had previously<br />\nserved as president of his class and<br />\nin numerous other capacities. He<br />\nwas interested in anything and<br />\neverything that he thought would<br />\nfurther the interests of Hopkins.<br />\nWherever he thought he could be<br />\nof some personal service, he offered himself and gave the best that<br />\nwas in him. He upheld the dignity<br />\nand honor of the high offices to<br />\nwhich he was elected in a manner<br />\nthat won the complete confidence<br />\nand respect of his fellow students.<br />\nA typical example of \"Alec\"<br />\nWolfe's loyalty to his Alma Mater<br />\nis the story of how he won his \"H\"<br />\nin football. When the call for football candidates went out last<br />\nfall\u2014Hopkins, we are proud to<br />\nsay, did not subscribe to the convenient \"informal football\" program\u2014it was evident that, in view<br />\nof the loss of so many Varsity men<br />\nwho had entered the service, a<br />\ngreat number of new men would<br />\nhave to learn the game if Hopkins<br />\nwas to have a representative team.<br />\nAlthough he had never in his life<br />\nplayed a game of football (unless<br />\nclass games could be called football), \"Alec\" was one of the first<br />\ncandidates to report to the coach<br />\nfor duty. He was light and he had<br />\nno experience, but he worked and<br />\nhe worked hard, and won a berth<br />\non a team that outfought, if it did<br />\nnot outplay every team it faced.<br />\n\"Alec\" contributed not a little, especially in pulling forward<br />\npasses out of the air and in jacking up the spirit of the team to<br />\nthe success, in spite of its defeats,<br />\nof the 1917 football team.<br />\nAs a member in his freshman<br />\nyear of one of the greatest Hopkins lacrosse teams and as captain<br />\nof the 1918 team he lived up to his<br />\nfamily name as a lacrosse star and<br />\nwon a high place for himself<br />\namong Hopkins' galaxy of lacrosse<br />\nmen. He always stood for the highest standards of sportsmanship<br />\nand was ever a credit to the team<br />\nof which he was a member and to<br />\nthe University which .he represented. His name stands high in<br />\nthe athletic history of Hopkins.<br />\nUnassuming, modest, and serenely calm, but sincere, deeply<br />\nearnest, and ever-willing, \"Alec\"<br />\nWolfe served the University as<br />\nfew men ever do. He will shed<br />\nglory upon the branch of the service he has entered, as he has shed<br />\nglory through his services and<br />\nthrough his conduct, upon his<br />\nAlma Mater.<br />\nThe Anniversary of Layfield's Death.<br />\n<br />\nsymbols for all posterity of a<br />\nheroic sacrifice\u2014of a life laid<br />\ndown for the honor of the University. They have been erected to<br />\nconsecrate the memory of Robert<br />\nTong Layfield, who, just 'three<br />\nyears ago, after four months of<br />\nuntold suffering as the result of<br />\nan injury in a Varsity football<br />\ngame, lost his plucky fight against<br />\ndeath.<br />\n\"Bob\" Layfield was a member of<br />\nthe Senior Class, the class of 1918.<br />\nHe did not consider his life too<br />\ndear when a question of the honor<br />\nof his University was involved. He<br />\npaid his tribute, and, smiling<br />\nthrough it all, he paid it like a<br />\nhero. It is good to know that the<br />\nspirit of sacrifice he enkindled in<br />\nthe hearts of his classmates and<br />\nfellow students has not died out.<br />\nIt lives on in the hearts of his<br />\nclassmates and fellow-students enlisted in the service of their country, ready to lay down their lives<br />\nfor the honor of their country as<br />\n\"Bobby\" hid 'down his for the<br />\nhonor of his Alma Mater.<br />\nThe Internationality of the Tocqueville<br />\nContest.<br />\n<br />\nIn these times of fervid nationalism, it is refreshing to note instances of non-belligerent international significance, of events that<br />\nbreathe the spirit of world-fraternity that we all look forward to<br />\nat the end of the war. The Tocquevile contest has been traditionally<br />\ninternational, in the sense that the<br />\nmedal is awarded by a Frenchman, Baron de Coubertin, in honor<br />\nof a fellow countryman, the famous Alexis de Tocqueville, to the<br />\nstudents of an AmePican University. But the successful competition of Thomas L. Hsi, a Chinese<br />\nstudent, in the preliminary trials<br />\nmakes the contest this year more<br />\ninternational than ever before.<br />\nThe fact that a Chinese student,<br />\nof whom there has always been a<br />\nrepresentative colony at Hopkins,<br />\nhas for the first time taken active<br />\npart in an undergraduate activity<br />\nis as noteworthy as the scholarly<br />\nfeat of a Chinese young man<br />\nmaking a public speech in a foreign tongue. Hsi has set up a<br />\nprecedent that we hope to see followed. When Chinese students are<br />\nwilling to take part in our games<br />\nand competitions, there will grow<br />\nup a corresponding international<br />\nfriendship that will withstand the<br />\nhardest tests.<br />\nThe enthusiasm and earnestness<br />\nwith which Hsi entered the preliminary trials augurs well for his<br />\nsuccess in the final contest, which<br />\nwill take place in the early part of<br />\nApril. THE NEWS-LETTER extends<br />\nto Hsi its sincere and heaity congratulations on his success in the<br />\ntryouts, and its best wishes for<br />\nsuccess in the final contest.<br />\n<br />\nOn Gilman campus on either<br />\nside of the stately portico of Gilman Hall stands a flagstaff\u2014one<br />\nSenior Class Fills Vacancies.<br />\nflying the colors of the University,<br />\nAt a meeting of the Senior Class<br />\nthe other flying the colors of the on last Monday, R.

This presumption is<br />\nstrengthened when we find that<br />\nthe Prussian Government denies<br />\nits own people the right to determine their own political destinies<br />\n\u2022 which asserts that, as a practical<br />\nproposition, it is not within the<br />\ncompetence of the popular will of<br />\neven an intellectually enlightened<br />\npeople to form intelligent judgments regarding matters of public<br />\npolicy unless guided and controlled by those in political authority,<br />\nand when we find that the Government is so organized and operated<br />\nthat it has the instrumentalities<br />\nthrough which it is able to mold<br />\npublic opinion, it no longer appears strange that. those in control should be able by reiterated<br />\naction, extending over several generations of time, to spread among<br />\nthe people doctrines which, however false, are surfaced over by a<br />\ntranscendental and pseudo-philosophical character which appeals<br />\nto patriotism on the emotional<br />\nside.<br />\nand G.

Being well<br />\naware also that France was better prepared than before, the Imperial Government planned another point for the main attack.<br />\nThe preparations of France were<br />\naided by the configuration of the<br />\ncountry, for between the border<br />\nand Paris there lies a series of<br />\nhill-ranges to every one of which<br />\nthe steep side is toward the east.<br />\nGoing from Paris toward the<br />\nRhine the land for some distance<br />\ngradually rises till it suddenly<br />\nfalls off in bluffs, then follow<br />\nother slopes and escarpments until some five long lines of defense<br />\nare formed on which the enemy<br />\nmust first take the bluff.<br />\nBut along the coast there is a<br />\nwide expanse of low rolling country which connects with the flat<br />\nsurface of Belgium and which<br />\nflanks the natural defenses of<br />\nthese hills. With a slight curve<br />\nthis affords an almost unobstructed path to Paris, and it is no wonder that the Germans expected to<br />\narrive in three weeks. If the Belgians had not held them back they<br />\nwould have kept the date. The<br />\nopen ends of the five lines of defenses were exposed to hostile attack while the enemy was at the<br />\nsame time pressing against the<br />\nfront.<br />\nHence if the question is asked<br />\nwhy the Germans did not follow<br />\nthe same plan as in the former<br />\nwar, it can readily be seen that<br />\nthey were already in possession of<br />\nwhat had been the weak point in<br />\nthe natural defense of France and<br />\nchose to disregard her treaties and<br />\ninternational obligations in order<br />\nto make an unbelievable use of a<br />\nweaker boundary of a neutral<br />\nState.<br />\nThis great plain has been a<br />\nbattlefield from time immemorial.<br />\nSince the days of Julius Caesar<br />\nthe nations have contended in that<br />\nThe English Edwards<br />\narea.<br />\nranged over the broad expanses<br />\nof the Netherlands and Picardie<br />\nin search of the French, and when<br />\nthey did not find the enemy they<br />\npillaged the inhabitants and burnt<br />\nthe towns. The wars of the great<br />\nalliance of nations against Louis<br />\nXIV brought that struggle also<br />\ninto this region and decisive battles were fought at Ramilies, Ondenarde and Malplaquet. Napoleon I met his fate at Waterloo<br />\nin the fertile fields of Belgium<br />\nalready scarred with the conflicts<br />\nof the races. We supposed the<br />\nend of such murderous contentions was near, but once again the<br />\nforests and the mountains to the<br />\nsouthward pointed to the plain as<br />\nthe tempting line of advance.<br />\nAnother region in this world<br />\nconflict has been a warpath for<br />\n<br />\nquite different reasons. Serbia is<br />\na country of hills and valleys.<br />\nOnly at the northern end, where<br />\nthe rivers flow into the Danube,<br />\nare there plains of limited extent.<br />\nThe river valleys of Serbia, however, are connecting links between<br />\nnorthern Europe and the countries of the Mediterranean. From<br />\na point near Belgrade on the Danube the valley of the Morava<br />\ntrends slowly upward and southward till it reaches a low watershed in a considerable plain near<br />\nUskub. From this point the waters of the Vadar river flow southward through another narrow valley into the Aegean Sea. This is<br />\nthe direct route to Salonika.<br />\nThe traveler from Belgrade to<br />\nConstantinople leaves the Morava<br />\nvalley at Nish, whence the road<br />\nclimbs a low range of hills into<br />\nBulgaria, passes Sofia, the capital of that country, then descends<br />\ninto the low-lying plains of Turkey by way of Philipopolis and<br />\nAdrianople. This route, now traversed in normal times by the<br />\nOriental express from Vienna and<br />\nParis or Berlin, was the track of<br />\nthe barbarians before the Romans<br />\nlaid out a military road. Crusaders on the long journey from western Europe to the Holy Land<br />\npassed through these valleys, and<br />\nin their turn the Turks, in search<br />\nof conquest,led their hordes northward to the plains of Hungary and<br />\nto the gates of Vienna. It is indeed a passage rather than a<br />\nstopping place, for, although Serbia is suitable for cattle raising<br />\nand certain kinds of farming, it<br />\nis not like Belgium, a country<br />\nteeming with industry and intensive agriculture.<br />\nYet the conformation of the<br />\nBalkan peninsula is such that<br />\nthis is not only the most convenient, but almost the only desirable<br />\nland route from the north to the<br />\nMediterranean and Asia Minor.<br />\nAustria has long sought control<br />\nof it, and by all sorts of diplomatic maneuvers has prevented<br />\nServia from making other outlets<br />\nfor her products to the Adriatic.<br />\nThe great plain of Hungary would<br />\nfind a channel for its grain and<br />\ncattle and the manufactures of<br />\nAustria an easier access to the<br />\nOrient if the dual monarchy could<br />\ncontrol exclusively the Serbian<br />\nvalleys.<br />\nStill more important are the<br />\ncommercial ambitions of Germany<br />\nat large. Finding that territorial<br />\nexpansion in the west is no longer<br />\npossible the Germans seek to create a domain of influence in Turkey, Asia Minor and Mesopotamia. They would follow this<br />\nwith political control and eventually build up an empire from<br />\nBerlin to Bagdad: This is the<br />\naim of the \"Mittel-Europa\" whose<br />\nform has been slowly emerging<br />\nfrom the imagination of German<br />\nschemers. It is a dream which<br />\nmight be made to come true, and<br />\nits reality depends on the control<br />\nof the small portion of the earth's<br />\nsurface which the Serbs have<br />\n<br />\nHONOR ROLL ON WALLS OF BARN<br />\nMaryland's Most<br />\nIn the recreation room of the<br />\nFamous Dishes<br />\n\"barn\" hangs a large framed roster of the Johns Hopkins students<br />\nwho left their alma mater to reTerrapin, Smithspond to the nation's call to arms.<br />\nfield Ham and<br />\nIn glancing over the list onenotes<br />\nGame<br />\nthe names of many former campus<br />\nleaders; in fact; the whole group<br />\nis highly representative of the<br />\nloyal type of men of which Hopkins has always boasted.<br />\nPHONE<br />\n2028 Druid Hill Ave.<br />\nMADISON 3420<br />\nIt is worthy of note that the list<br />\nincludes the names of 15 lieutenants, 2 ensigns, 12 sergeants, and<br />\n3 corporals.

The inspection was as rigid<br />\nas could be; and although the appearance and condition of the battalion was, on the whole, satisfactory, still the commandant was<br />\nnot well pleased with the numerous dirty leggins, soiled clothes,<br />\nand missing insignia.

Torsch, '21, to the Board<br />\nof Associate Editors.<br />\n\"Alec\" Wolfe.<br /><br />\nOne more name was added to<br />\nthe long list of Hopkins men in the<br />\nservice, and one more leader was<br />\nlost to the undergraduate student<br />\nbody at Homewood when \"Alec\"<br />\nWolfe\u2014taking leave of his Alma<br />\nMater he has served so faithfully<br />\nfor all but four years\u2014headed for<br />\na ground school of the Naval Aviation Corps. Since last spring we<br />\nhave learned to expect shocks and<br />\nsudden losses, but last week we experienced a sense of loss that bordered closely on a feeling of depair. We knew only too well that<br />\nwe were losing a leader whose<br />\nplace it would be difficult,. if not<br />\nimpossible, to fill. We almost forgot to be proud that he was entering the service of his country, that<br />\nhe was entering a branch of the<br />\nservice in which there was room<br />\nfor only the cream of the nation's<br />\nyouth\u2014into which it was a privilege and an honor to be accepted.<br />\nIf any man at Homewood could<br />\nbe called a student leader, it was<br />\n\"Alec\" Wolfe. As president of the<br />\nHopkins circle of the Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa, as head of the General Athletic Association, and as<br />\ncaptain of the lacrosse team, he<br /><br />\nheld as many prominent positions<br />\nas it is physically possible for one<br />\nman to hold down with any degree<br />\nof credit. He won his\"H\" in football last fall, was a member of the<br />\nDebating Council, had previously<br />\nserved as president of his class and<br />\nin numerous other capacities. He<br />\nwas interested in anything and<br />\neverything that he thought would<br />\nfurther the interests of Hopkins.<br />\nWherever he thought he could be<br />\nof some personal service, he offered himself and gave the best that<br />\nwas in him. He upheld the dignity<br />\nand honor of the high offices to<br />\nwhich he was elected in a manner<br />\nthat won the complete confidence<br />\nand respect of his fellow students.<br />\nA typical example of \"Alec\"<br />\nWolfe's loyalty to his Alma Mater<br />\nis the story of how he won his \"H\"<br />\nin football. When the call for football candidates went out last<br />\nfall\u2014Hopkins, we are proud to<br />\nsay, did not subscribe to the convenient \"informal football\" program\u2014it was evident that, in view<br />\nof the loss of so many Varsity men<br />\nwho had entered the service, a<br />\ngreat number of new men would<br />\nhave to learn the game if Hopkins<br />\nwas to have a representative team.<br />\nAlthough he had never in his life<br />\nplayed a game of football (unless<br />\nclass games could be called football), \"Alec\" was one of the first<br />\ncandidates to report to the coach<br />\nfor duty. He was light and he had<br />\nno experience, but he worked and<br />\nhe worked hard, and won a berth<br />\non a team that outfought, if it did<br />\nnot outplay every team it faced.<br />\n\"Alec\" contributed not a little, especially in pulling forward<br />\npasses out of the air and in jacking up the spirit of the team to<br />\nthe success, in spite of its defeats,<br />\nof the 1917 football team.<br />\nAs a member in his freshman<br />\nyear of one of the greatest Hopkins lacrosse teams and as captain<br />\nof the 1918 team he lived up to his<br />\nfamily name as a lacrosse star and<br />\nwon a high place for himself<br />\namong Hopkins' galaxy of lacrosse<br />\nmen. He always stood for the highest standards of sportsmanship<br />\nand was ever a credit to the team<br />\nof which he was a member and to<br />\nthe University which .he represented. His name stands high in<br />\nthe athletic history of Hopkins.<br />\nUnassuming, modest, and serenely calm, but sincere, deeply<br />\nearnest, and ever-willing, \"Alec\"<br />\nWolfe served the University as<br />\nfew men ever do. He will shed<br />\nglory upon the branch of the service he has entered, as he has shed<br />\nglory through his services and<br />\nthrough his conduct, upon his<br />\nAlma Mater.<br />\nThe Anniversary of Layfield's Death.<br /><br />\nsymbols for all posterity of a<br />\nheroic sacrifice\u2014of a life laid<br />\ndown for the honor of the University. They have been erected to<br />\nconsecrate the memory of Robert<br />\nTong Layfield, who, just 'three<br />\nyears ago, after four months of<br />\nuntold suffering as the result of<br />\nan injury in a Varsity football<br />\ngame, lost his plucky fight against<br />\ndeath.<br />\n\"Bob\" Layfield was a member of<br />\nthe Senior Class, the class of 1918.<br />\nHe did not consider his life too<br />\ndear when a question of the honor<br />\nof his University was involved. He<br />\npaid his tribute, and, smiling<br />\nthrough it all, he paid it like a<br />\nhero. It is good to know that the<br />\nspirit of sacrifice he enkindled in<br />\nthe hearts of his classmates and<br />\nfellow students has not died out.<br />\nIt lives on in the hearts of his<br />\nclassmates and fellow-students enlisted in the service of their country, ready to lay down their lives<br />\nfor the honor of their country as<br />\n\"Bobby\" hid 'down his for the<br />\nhonor of his Alma Mater.<br />\nThe Internationality of the Tocqueville<br />\nContest.<br /><br />\nIn these times of fervid nationalism, it is refreshing to note instances of non-belligerent international significance, of events that<br />\nbreathe the spirit of world-fraternity that we all look forward to<br />\nat the end of the war. The Tocquevile contest has been traditionally<br />\ninternational, in the sense that the<br />\nmedal is awarded by a Frenchman, Baron de Coubertin, in honor<br />\nof a fellow countryman, the famous Alexis de Tocqueville, to the<br />\nstudents of an AmePican University. But the successful competition of Thomas L. Hsi, a Chinese<br />\nstudent, in the preliminary trials<br />\nmakes the contest this year more<br />\ninternational than ever before.<br />\nThe fact that a Chinese student,<br />\nof whom there has always been a<br />\nrepresentative colony at Hopkins,<br />\nhas for the first time taken active<br />\npart in an undergraduate activity<br />\nis as noteworthy as the scholarly<br />\nfeat of a Chinese young man<br />\nmaking a public speech in a foreign tongue. Hsi has set up a<br />\nprecedent that we hope to see followed. When Chinese students are<br />\nwilling to take part in our games<br />\nand competitions, there will grow<br />\nup a corresponding international<br />\nfriendship that will withstand the<br />\nhardest tests.<br />\nThe enthusiasm and earnestness<br />\nwith which Hsi entered the preliminary trials augurs well for his<br />\nsuccess in the final contest, which<br />\nwill take place in the early part of<br />\nApril. THE NEWS-LETTER extends<br />\nto Hsi its sincere and heaity congratulations on his success in the<br />\ntryouts, and its best wishes for<br />\nsuccess in the final contest.<br /><br />\nOn Gilman campus on either<br />\nside of the stately portico of Gilman Hall stands a flagstaff\u2014one<br />\nSenior Class Fills Vacancies.<br />\nflying the colors of the University,<br />\nAt a meeting of the Senior Class<br />\nthe other flying the colors of the on last Monday, R.

This presumption is<br />\nstrengthened when we find that<br />\nthe Prussian Government denies<br />\nits own people the right to determine their own political destinies<br />\n\u2022 which asserts that, as a practical<br />\nproposition, it is not within the<br />\ncompetence of the popular will of<br />\neven an intellectually enlightened<br />\npeople to form intelligent judgments regarding matters of public<br />\npolicy unless guided and controlled by those in political authority,<br />\nand when we find that the Government is so organized and operated<br />\nthat it has the instrumentalities<br />\nthrough which it is able to mold<br />\npublic opinion, it no longer appears strange that. those in control should be able by reiterated<br />\naction, extending over several generations of time, to spread among<br />\nthe people doctrines which, however false, are surfaced over by a<br />\ntranscendental and pseudo-philosophical character which appeals<br />\nto patriotism on the emotional<br />\nside.<br />\nand G.

Being well<br />\naware also that France was better prepared than before, the Imperial Government planned another point for the main attack.<br />\nThe preparations of France were<br />\naided by the configuration of the<br />\ncountry, for between the border<br />\nand Paris there lies a series of<br />\nhill-ranges to every one of which<br />\nthe steep side is toward the east.<br />\nGoing from Paris toward the<br />\nRhine the land for some distance<br />\ngradually rises till it suddenly<br />\nfalls off in bluffs, then follow<br />\nother slopes and escarpments until some five long lines of defense<br />\nare formed on which the enemy<br />\nmust first take the bluff.<br />\nBut along the coast there is a<br />\nwide expanse of low rolling country which connects with the flat<br />\nsurface of Belgium and which<br />\nflanks the natural defenses of<br />\nthese hills. With a slight curve<br />\nthis affords an almost unobstructed path to Paris, and it is no wonder that the Germans expected to<br />\narrive in three weeks. If the Belgians had not held them back they<br />\nwould have kept the date. The<br />\nopen ends of the five lines of defenses were exposed to hostile attack while the enemy was at the<br />\nsame time pressing against the<br />\nfront.<br />\nHence if the question is asked<br />\nwhy the Germans did not follow<br />\nthe same plan as in the former<br />\nwar, it can readily be seen that<br />\nthey were already in possession of<br />\nwhat had been the weak point in<br />\nthe natural defense of France and<br />\nchose to disregard her treaties and<br />\ninternational obligations in order<br />\nto make an unbelievable use of a<br />\nweaker boundary of a neutral<br />\nState.<br />\nThis great plain has been a<br />\nbattlefield from time immemorial.<br />\nSince the days of Julius Caesar<br />\nthe nations have contended in that<br />\nThe English Edwards<br />\narea.<br />\nranged over the broad expanses<br />\nof the Netherlands and Picardie<br />\nin search of the French, and when<br />\nthey did not find the enemy they<br />\npillaged the inhabitants and burnt<br />\nthe towns. The wars of the great<br />\nalliance of nations against Louis<br />\nXIV brought that struggle also<br />\ninto this region and decisive battles were fought at Ramilies, Ondenarde and Malplaquet. Napoleon I met his fate at Waterloo<br />\nin the fertile fields of Belgium<br />\nalready scarred with the conflicts<br />\nof the races. We supposed the<br />\nend of such murderous contentions was near, but once again the<br />\nforests and the mountains to the<br />\nsouthward pointed to the plain as<br />\nthe tempting line of advance.<br />\nAnother region in this world<br />\nconflict has been a warpath for<br /><br />\nquite different reasons. Serbia is<br />\na country of hills and valleys.<br />\nOnly at the northern end, where<br />\nthe rivers flow into the Danube,<br />\nare there plains of limited extent.<br />\nThe river valleys of Serbia, however, are connecting links between<br />\nnorthern Europe and the countries of the Mediterranean. From<br />\na point near Belgrade on the Danube the valley of the Morava<br />\ntrends slowly upward and southward till it reaches a low watershed in a considerable plain near<br />\nUskub. From this point the waters of the Vadar river flow southward through another narrow valley into the Aegean Sea. This is<br />\nthe direct route to Salonika.<br />\nThe traveler from Belgrade to<br />\nConstantinople leaves the Morava<br />\nvalley at Nish, whence the road<br />\nclimbs a low range of hills into<br />\nBulgaria, passes Sofia, the capital of that country, then descends<br />\ninto the low-lying plains of Turkey by way of Philipopolis and<br />\nAdrianople. This route, now traversed in normal times by the<br />\nOriental express from Vienna and<br />\nParis or Berlin, was the track of<br />\nthe barbarians before the Romans<br />\nlaid out a military road. Crusaders on the long journey from western Europe to the Holy Land<br />\npassed through these valleys, and<br />\nin their turn the Turks, in search<br />\nof conquest,led their hordes northward to the plains of Hungary and<br />\nto the gates of Vienna. It is indeed a passage rather than a<br />\nstopping place, for, although Serbia is suitable for cattle raising<br />\nand certain kinds of farming, it<br />\nis not like Belgium, a country<br />\nteeming with industry and intensive agriculture.<br />\nYet the conformation of the<br />\nBalkan peninsula is such that<br />\nthis is not only the most convenient, but almost the only desirable<br />\nland route from the north to the<br />\nMediterranean and Asia Minor.<br />\nAustria has long sought control<br />\nof it, and by all sorts of diplomatic maneuvers has prevented<br />\nServia from making other outlets<br />\nfor her products to the Adriatic.<br />\nThe great plain of Hungary would<br />\nfind a channel for its grain and<br />\ncattle and the manufactures of<br />\nAustria an easier access to the<br />\nOrient if the dual monarchy could<br />\ncontrol exclusively the Serbian<br />\nvalleys.<br />\nStill more important are the<br />\ncommercial ambitions of Germany<br />\nat large. Finding that territorial<br />\nexpansion in the west is no longer<br />\npossible the Germans seek to create a domain of influence in Turkey, Asia Minor and Mesopotamia. They would follow this<br />\nwith political control and eventually build up an empire from<br />\nBerlin to Bagdad: This is the<br />\naim of the \"Mittel-Europa\" whose<br />\nform has been slowly emerging<br />\nfrom the imagination of German<br />\nschemers. It is a dream which<br />\nmight be made to come true, and<br />\nits reality depends on the control<br />\nof the small portion of the earth's<br />\nsurface which the Serbs have<br /><br />\nHONOR ROLL ON WALLS OF BARN<br />\nMaryland's Most<br />\nIn the recreation room of the<br />\nFamous Dishes<br />\n\"barn\" hangs a large framed roster of the Johns Hopkins students<br />\nwho left their alma mater to reTerrapin, Smithspond to the nation's call to arms.<br />\nfield Ham and<br />\nIn glancing over the list onenotes<br />\nGame<br />\nthe names of many former campus<br />\nleaders; in fact; the whole group<br />\nis highly representative of the<br />\nloyal type of men of which Hopkins has always boasted.<br />\nPHONE<br />\n2028 Druid Hill Ave.<br />\nMADISON 3420<br />\nIt is worthy of note that the list<br />\nincludes the names of 15 lieutenants, 2 ensigns, 12 sergeants, and<br />\n3 corporals.

The inspection was as rigid<br />\nas could be; and although the appearance and condition of the battalion was, on the whole, satisfactory, still the commandant was<br />\nnot well pleased with the numerous dirty leggins, soiled clothes,<br />\nand missing insignia.
