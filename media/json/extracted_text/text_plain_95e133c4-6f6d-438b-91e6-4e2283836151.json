A<br />\nsimilar proposal was made last<br />\nyear by Dr. J. C.

N credits<br />\nare generally given for science<br />\ncourses, Q credits for quantitative studies, and E credits for<br />\nengineering courses. Under the<br />\ncurrent system,only six N,Q,or<br />\nE credits are required for nonscience majors.<br />\nCUS member Steve Viggiani<br />\nalso proposed that all departmental majors in Math,\"Science,<br />\nEngineering and Natural Sciences be required to distribute<br />\ntheir 18 H (humanities) and S<br />\n(social sciences) credits in such a<br />\nmanner that at least 6 of them<br />\nmust be in either the Humanities<br />\nor Social Sciences. In other<br />\nwords, students would be unable<br />\nto take all their 18 credits in<br />\neither Humanities or the Social<br />\nSciences.<br />\nThe second point in the<br />\n<br />\nCUS proposal states that for<br />\nelements courses in language,<br />\nonly one credit should be Ale to<br />\ncontribute to the H and S<br />\ndistribution requirements.<br />\nWalker's proposal also stipulated that \"no courses required<br />\nfor graduation may be taken in<br />\nthe Evening College by day<br />\ndivision students with the exception of engineering.\" This year's<br />\nCUS eliminated this third provision.<br />\nAlthough<br />\nproposal<br />\nthe<br />\npassed, Dean of Graduate and<br />\nUndergraduate Studies Michael<br />\nHooker felt that it had been<br />\nrushed through and that it<br />\nshould not be submitted to the<br />\nAcademic Council without fur-<br />\n<br />\nther work.<br />\nChuck Peifer,<br />\nStudent<br />\nCouncil<br />\npresident,<br />\nbrought up the fact that it had<br />\nnot been submitted to the<br />\nAcademic Council this year<br />\nbecause, practically, the Academic Council should have reviewed it immediately after it<br />\npassed CUS last year.<br />\nPeifer said, \"There was a<br />\nconcern the courses did not<br />\nexist\" and that work would have<br />\nto be done within the departments to broaden their course<br />\nselection.

About<br />\n60 percent of those interested in<br />\nthe Humanities will be admitted.<br />\nThe primary concern of the<br />\nUniversity in deciding who to<br />\nadmit is academic qualifications,<br />\nalthough nonacademic interests<br />\nalso play a role. Although the<br />\nUniversity is \"sex-blind\" in<br />\nadmitting students, Hopkins<br />\ndoes actively recruit female<br />\napplicants.

At present, the CUS is<br />\ncomprised of four students and<br />\nsix faculty representatives, none<br />\nof whom are members of the<br />\nAcademic Council. This proposal, passed by the CUS on<br />\nApril 1, has been forwarded to<br />\nthe Academic Council for approval.<br />\nCUS member Doug Fellman<br />\nbelieves that this measure will<br />\nbenefit the CUS. \"It will greatly<br />\nenhance the credibility of the<br />\nCUS when its proposals go<br />\nbefore the Academic Council,\"<br />\nhe said. Student Council president Chuck Peifer agrees that<br />\nthe lack of coordination between these two academic<br />\n<br />\nbodies contributes to the apparent disregard of many CUS<br />\nrecommendations by the Academic Council. \"CUS proposals<br />\ndon't seem to carry much weight<br />\nwith the Academic Council,\"<br />\nPeifer contends.<br />\nThe Academic Council has<br />\nnot yet put the CUS proposal on<br />\nits agenda. However, the council<br />\nis expected to consider this<br />\nmatter before the faculty appointments to the CUS are made<br />\nfor next year. Should the<br />\nAcademic Council approve the<br />\nCUS recommendation, the measure would take effect in September.<br />\nThe CUS hopes that this<br />\nmove will promote greater interaction - between the Academic<br />\nCouncil and the CUS in the<br />\nfuture. \"Currently there is no<br />\n,one kt the Academic C01.11161<br />\nlmeetings to represent the CUS<br />\nviews,\" explains Fellman. \"If<br />\nthis is approved, there will be<br />\n,two members there to lend<br />\nsupport.\" \u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4 / APRIL 9,1982<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nGood Yuntov, Pontiff<br />\nThe News-Letter is published weekly during the school year by the<br />\nstudents of the Johns Hopkins University.

Since<br />\nits \"introduction,. _the pEcipiQsal4<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Council became locked<br />\nin mortal combat with itself this week over<br />\nthe issue of whether or not its members<br />\ncould speak for the student body in taking<br />\na stand against Reagan's student financial<br />\naid cuts. Sophomore class president Mike<br />\nKun played the devil's advocate, proposing<br />\nthat if the Student Council could represent<br />\nthe students on one political issue outside<br />\nHopkins, then it should be fully empowered to act as the students' political<br />\nrepresentatives on all such issues.<br />\nKun's point certainly can't be<br />\nargued with: by no means do we want<br />\nto have to worry about a student official's views on El Salvador or grain shipments to the Soviet Union.

Tenure, therefore,<br />\nis one of the things most junior<br />\nfaculty members are seeking.<br />\nThe question which arises at<br />\nthis point is whether the quality<br />\nof undergraduate education suffers as a result of University<br />\npolicies involving research and<br />\ntenure. If a professor desires<br />\ntenure, can he meet this end<br />\nthrough good teaching? In other<br />\nwords, is good teaching rewardOr<br />\ned in tenure decisions?<br />\nperhaps we should ask if, in the<br />\neyes of junior faculty members,<br />\ngood teaching is rewarded in<br />\ntenure decisions.<br />\nThe tenure process at Johns<br />\nHopkins, like those of other<br />\nleading universities, is marked by<br />\nan element of secrecy and<br />\nmystery. Many members of the<br />\nwhich<br />\nAcademic Council sends tenure recommendations<br />\nto the Board of Trustees - are<br />\ncompletely satisfied with the<br />\nprocess. They argue that teaching is considered when deciding<br />\non a candidate for tenure and,<br />\nthough a candidate with impeccable research credentials probably won't be turned away<br />\nbecause of poor teaching or a<br />\nlack of commitment to undergraduates, otherwise solid candidates have in the past been<br />\nrejected on the basis of poor<br />\nteaching. This may be so. But<br />\nWere is no standard procedure,<br />\nbuilt into the current process,<br />\nfor linking teaching to tenure. If<br />\nenacted, the 40-letter requirement would represent on the<br />\npart of the University a true<br />\ncommitment to teaching. Further, the proposal is one way to<br />\ncompel faculty members to<br />\nassociate themselves with undergraduates.<br />\nThe 40-letter approach is<br />\nsimple and innocuous enough.<br />\nWe have proposed that professors who apply for tenure be<br />\nrequired to ask 40 of their<br />\nundergraduates to write a letter<br />\nattesting to that candidate's<br />\nteaching ability.

Second, if the<br />\nforty letters become a permanent part of the tenure process,<br />\nit will be a message to all new<br />\nfaculty members that this University takes seriously the teaching of its undergraduates. Right<br />\nnow, new faculty members learn<br />\nquickly that it is their research,<br />\nnot their teaching, which will get<br />\nthem ahead at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe 40-letters plan will change<br />\nAnd it will<br />\nthis situation.<br />\nand lastimportant<br />\nan<br />\nestablish<br />\ning (and currently missing) bond<br />\nbetween undergraduates and the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nLegitimate questions have<br />\nbeen raised regarding the letters<br />\nproposal.

As<br />\nwith the harvest, the weather can't be<br />\ncontrolled; precautions can be taken, and contingencies provided for, but if it really rains, everyone is screwed.<br />\n\"The Fair has always had an unwritten<br />\nagreement with God that it wouldn't rain,\" says<br />\nStudent Council president Chuck Peifer. \"Last<br />\nyear, He went back on the deal.\"<br />\nOf course the harvest analogy only goes so<br />\nfar-people on farms don't make reaping time an<br />\nopen house event for 150,000 city folks, while<br />\nthe Fair does. It was not only God who caused<br />\nheadaches for the Fair last year, but the seemingly inevitable combustion of huge crowds<br />\npacked into this small and usually placid campus. A report by the Student Council's Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee on Spring Fair ,documented only<br />\none incident of violence, in which a student was<br />\nthreatened at knife-point by a teenaged boy, but<br />\npeople close to the Fair mention other incidents,<br />\nand describe an increasingly unmanageable<br />\nsituation that was threatening to get totally out<br />\nof hand. Says Chris Colombo, the administration's Director of Student Services, \"The question everyone was asking was, 'How do you<br />\ncontrol that crowd out there, most of whom<br />\naren't students and most of whom are rowdy?'\"<br />\nThe result of these headaches, as Chuck<br />\nPeifer says, was that \"the Fair became vulnerable to attack from its long-time foes.\" Basically these foes were faculty members, who sent<br />\nletters complaining about the commercial<br />\natmosphere, the dangers of vandalism, the noise,<br />\nand the difficulties of working on weekends. At<br />\none point this fall, the Fair was in real danger of<br />\nbecoming a two day, non-musical event held<br />\nonly on the baseball field. However, the Student Council, in answer to these attacks by<br />\nfaculty members, proposed a complete ban of<br />\nrock music from the Fair, and a ban of any sort<br />\nof music from Gilman Quad during the Fair.<br />\nThis proposal has since been modified, but the<br />\nconflict has left a number of questions about the<br />\nnature of the Fair. It has on the one hand, left<br />\nruffled feathers and bad feelings among some<br />\npeople who feel Strongly about the presence of<br />\nmusic at the Fair. On the other hand, those who<br />\nview the Fair as a nuisance have complaints<br />\nwhich will linger for awhile, and which could<br />\nstill define the character of future Fairs. These<br />\npeople, primarily faculty, view the Fair as a<br />\ncommercial event, contrary to the spirit of a<br />\n\"student fair.\" Both sides have brought into<br />\nquestion the character of the Fair --what should<br />\n. it be, who is it for, and who should control it'?<br />\nThe Fair chairmen and the Student Council are<br />\nleft in the middle, with the task of answering<br />\ntheir questions and shaping the Fair. The results<br />\nmay<br />\n_. be taking the Fair in unexpected directions.<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\nHIS<br />\n<br />\n- Hasitgone commercial?<br />\n<br />\nThe first Fair was held in 1972, and<br />\nattracted a crowd of about 20,000 people over a<br />\nthree-day period. The idea for the Fair had<br />\ngrown out of a Student Council proposal the<br />\nyear before for a Fine Arts Festival, but even in<br />\nits first year, The Fair went beyond the \"fine<br />\narts\" and was conceived of more as a public<br />\nrelations gesture to the surrounding community.<br />\nIt s title, 3400 on Stage, was derived from the<br />\nschool's address, 3400 North Charles -thus,<br />\n\"Hopkins on Stage.\" An article in the News<br />\nAmerican in 1972 quotes the Fair's chairman of<br />\nthat year, Bobbi Nuttle, as saying:<br />\n\"The philosophy behind the festival is to<br />\npresent Johns Hopkins to surrounding neighborhoods by bringing members of the community<br />\non campus for three days that we hope will<br />\nprovide fun and active social contact.\"<br />\nAnd the Student Council president of that<br />\nyear, Gerald Bates, laid even greater stress on the<br />\nschool's relationship to the community:<br />\n\"Some students feel the University should<br />\n<br />\nhave a greater commitment to the community. traditional lines of the Fair.<br />\nIt's just the realization that you're living in an \u2022<br />\n\"Aside from the music changes, we're<br />\nurban environment; and you should be part of working with the basic structure of all the<br />\nit.<br />\nprevious Fairs we've seen,\" says Snyder. \"We<br />\nrun it a lot like a business because we have<br />\nto-it's that large, and we do have to worry<br />\nabout how much money we're bringing in. But<br />\nour main concern is that the students have a<br />\ngood time, and a lot of what we make goes<br />\ntoward the nighttime entertainment, which is<br />\nfor students only.\"<br />\nAnd Nimaroff adds that while getting<br />\nmore Hopkins people involved in the actual<br />\nentertainment itself \"would be a good idea,<br />\nsomething to work on for next year,\" he says<br />\nthat this year's Fair has had \"too many other<br />\nconcerns to deal with, such as appeasing the<br />\nfaculty.\"<br />\nBoth chairmen say that the administration<br />\nputs no pressure on them to make money or top<br />\nprevious profits. \"All we're told is that we have<br />\nto break even,\" says Snyder.<br />\nHowever, the Fair has undeniably been a<br />\nMike Nimaroff - Fair Chairman '82<br />\ncommercial vehicle in recent years for the<br />\nIt's interesting in light of the criticisms individual student activity groups who operate<br />\nthat the Fair .has become commercialized to concession stands, if not for the students runlook at the program for the '72 Fair, and see ning the Fair itself.

Much was the samerock music, concession booths, and a smattering<br />\nof carney rides. On the other hand, there was<br />\nmore of an emphasis on displaying Hopkins<br />\nitself: exhibits, lectures, and tours by the Metro<br />\nCenter and the physics and archaeology departments; art collections owned by Hopkins faculty<br />\nand alumni; several intercollegiate athletic<br />\nevents; student plays and poetry readings; and<br />\nan equal representation of music by students,<br />\nsome from Hopkins, others from Peabody and<br />\nTowson State.<br />\nToday, of course, the Fair attracts a<br />\ncrowd nearly eight times as large. The entertainment features more people from the outside --big<br />\nname comedians and musical groups, the full<br />\ngamut of carney rides in the freshman quad. On<br />\nthe other hand, as this year's Fair chairmen<br />\npoint out, more students than ever before are<br />\ninvolved in the running of the Fair.<br />\n\"If you total up students working on the<br />\nFair, and student groups working booths, you<br />\nprobably have about a quarter of the school<br />\ninvolved in the Fair,\" says co-chairman Mike<br />\nNimaroff. \"It's quite an experience to be<br />\ninvolved in the running of something like this.\"<br />\nWhile recent Fairs have certainly been<br />\nmore of \"an event\" than their predecessors,<br />\nthere have been objections to them simply on<br />\naesthetic grounds alone.<br />\n\"I don't enjoy the Fairs, anymore, and it<br />\nseems to me I used to,\" says Professor Dean<br />\nRobinson, chairman of the Chemistry Department. \"The quality of the exhibits have gone<br />\ndown- there used to be better things to look at,<br />\nbetter music and more cultural exhibits.

Despite all that,<br />\nPeter Scott tossed in a goal 17<br />\nseconds into overtime, giving the<br />\nBlue Jays their fifth win of the<br />\nseason last Saturday over Virginia, 12-11.<br />\nThe start of the overtime<br />\nperiod wasn't unlike most of<br />\nregulation play. The Cavaliers<br />\nwere able to control the ball<br />\nafter the face off and drove<br />\nstraight into Hopkins territory.<br />\nThis time around, however,<br />\nthe outcome was slightly different. During the game, more<br />\noften than not, goals resulted<br />\nfrom these fast breaks, but this<br />\ntime the ball was jarred loose<br />\nand Marty Bergin scooped it up<br />\nand charged upfield, tossing a<br />\nperfect pass to Pete Scott for the<br />\nwinning goal.<br />\nSaturday's game was only<br />\npartly similar to a usual Blue Jay<br />\ngame. The attack unit of Jeff<br />\nCook, Pete Scott, and Mike<br />\nDonnelly scored ten times, but<br />\nthat's just about it. The first<br />\nmidfield unit of Henry Ciccarone, Jr., John Krumenacker,<br />\nand Bill Cantelli were good for<br />\nonly one goal, and to make<br />\nmatters worse, the second midfield was only able to get three<br />\n<br />\nshots on goal the entire afternoon. Those statistics tell the<br />\nstory of the whole game.<br />\nThe whole contest was a<br />\nseesaw battle, but in an unusual<br />\nwhile the Blue Jays<br />\nway:<br />\ncontrolled the play in the first<br />\nand third quarters, Virginia was<br />\nequally strong the remaining<br />\ntime. After jumping out to a<br />\n4-1 lead in the driving rain of the<br />\nfirst quarter, the defensive unit<br />\nallowed five unanswered goals in<br />\nthe sun of the second quarter,<br />\nand when the dust settled the<br />\nscore was tied at six.<br />\nAfter the teams returned<br />\nfrom the locker room, the only<br />\nnoticeable difference was that<br />\nthis time around the sun was<br />\nshining brightly, and as things<br />\nstarted up, it looked like a<br />\nrepeat of the first half. The<br />\nJays dominated the action, once<br />\nagain taking a commanding lead<br />\ninto the fourth quarter. As<br />\nalways, most of the scoring was<br />\nfrom up front, but that was<br />\ngood enough for the situation,<br />\nconsidering the lead. Then as<br />\nthe whistle blew, starting the<br />\nsecond half, the Cavaliers started<br />\nto slow the game down. They<br />\nbecame more deliberate, and<br />\nworked the ball around looking<br />\nfor the open shot, denying<br />\nHopkins the chance to score,<br />\nand that tactic was good for<br />\nthree goals. The Blue Jays had<br />\nbarely touched the ball the<br />\nwhole quarter. So with under<br />\ntwo minutes to go, the teams<br />\nwere deadlocked at 11.<br />\nThe final chance the Blue<br />\nJays had was with about one and<br />\na half minutes to go in the game,<br />\nas Henry Ciccarone took the ball<br />\n<br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nFriday, April 9<br />\nGolf vs. Western Md. at Franklin & Marshall :00 p.m.(A)<br />\n3.00 p.m.(H)<br />\nMen's Tennis vs. UM13C<br />\np.m.(A)<br />\n4-00<br />\nWomen's Lacrosse vs. Haverford<br />\nSaturday, April 10<br />\n2:00 p.m.(H)<br />\nMen's Lacrosse vs. North Carolina<br />\n1:00 p.m.(A)<br />\nBaseball vs. Ursinus(2)<br />\np.m.(H)<br />\n1:00<br />\n(V&JV)<br />\nMd.<br />\nWomen's Lacrosse vs. Western<br />\nTuesday, April 13<br />\n1 .00 p.m.(A)<br />\nGolf vs. Phila.

To satisfy nly<br />\ncuriosity, I recently posed<br />\nsome of my questions to Ferdinand Nebbish, an expert on the<br />\nmany nuances of sports.<br />\nHave you ever wondered<br />\nwhy hockey players \"change on<br />\nthe fly?\" Well, according to<br />\nNebbish, the expression arose in<br />\nthe 1920's when Irving Blintze<br />\nbroke the zipper on his uniform.<br />\nUntil that time, substitutions<br />\nwere allowed only on whistles.<br />\nHowever, Blintze, too embarrassed to continue playing with<br />\nhis fly open, headed for the<br />\nbench and a substitute came on<br />\nthe ice for him. At first, the<br />\nreferee was going to call a<br />\npenalty, but he decided that<br />\nbecause Blintze had a broken<br />\nzipper, the substitution was<br />\njustified. From that point on,<br />\nwhenever a player became tired<br />\nand wanted to ga to the bench,<br />\nhe just . opened \".4.6 zipper. In<br />\n1945, to prevent this maneuver,<br />\nuniforms were Aade without<br />\nzippers. Nevertheless, one year<br />\nlater, the National Hockey<br />\nLeague decided to allow teams<br />\nto substitute freely, or in modern hockey jargon, change on<br />\nthe fly.<br />\n<br />\nAfter remaining healthy for<br />\nthe past few seasons, this year's<br />\nsquad has been hit with quite a<br />\nfew injuries. It is questionable<br />\nwhether captain and shortstop<br />\nBill Stromberg, who is suffering<br />\nfrom a pulled groin, will play at<br />\nall this year. Third baseman<br />\nMark Crowe is out indefinitely<br />\nwith hepatitis, and first baseman<br />\nBob Martino, who had been<br />\nhitting .357, is suffering a pulled<br />\nhamstring and his status will be<br />\ndetermined on a game by game<br />\n<br />\nbasis. This leaves the team with<br />\nonly a single third baseman,<br />\nshortstop, and second baseman.<br />\nThe Jays have been forced to use<br />\na pair of freshmen at third and<br />\nshort, Bob Cardwell and Tom<br />\nHarmon.. It is very difficult for<br />\nplayers to step right in and play<br />\nsolid infield at the college level.<br />\nThe two have had some defensive trouble and, not surprisingly, both are also playing with<br />\npulled groins.<br />\nA look at the hitting statistics shows that Andy Lachance<br />\nhas clearly been the batting star<br />\nof the team, with a .400 average<br />\nand a team-leading nine RBI's.<br />\nBut besides the injured Martino,<br />\nnone of the other Jay starters<br />\nare hitting above .300.

A<br />\nsimilar proposal was made last<br />\nyear by Dr. J. C. Walker, although no final action was taken<br />\nby the Academic Council.<br />\nThe current proposal addresses three major points.<br />\nFirstly, it increases from 6 to 12<br />\nthe number of N,Q,or E credits<br />\nrequired for graduation for students majoring in any Humanities or Social and Behavioral<br />\nScience departments. N credits<br />\nare generally given for science<br />\ncourses, Q credits for quantitative studies, and E credits for<br />\nengineering courses. Under the<br />\ncurrent system,only six N,Q,or<br />\nE credits are required for nonscience majors.<br />\nCUS member Steve Viggiani<br />\nalso proposed that all departmental majors in Math,\"Science,<br />\nEngineering and Natural Sciences be required to distribute<br />\ntheir 18 H (humanities) and S<br />\n(social sciences) credits in such a<br />\nmanner that at least 6 of them<br />\nmust be in either the Humanities<br />\nor Social Sciences. In other<br />\nwords, students would be unable<br />\nto take all their 18 credits in<br />\neither Humanities or the Social<br />\nSciences.<br />\nThe second point in the<br /><br />\nCUS proposal states that for<br />\nelements courses in language,<br />\nonly one credit should be Ale to<br />\ncontribute to the H and S<br />\ndistribution requirements.<br />\nWalker's proposal also stipulated that \"no courses required<br />\nfor graduation may be taken in<br />\nthe Evening College by day<br />\ndivision students with the exception of engineering.\" This year's<br />\nCUS eliminated this third provision.<br />\nAlthough<br />\nproposal<br />\nthe<br />\npassed, Dean of Graduate and<br />\nUndergraduate Studies Michael<br />\nHooker felt that it had been<br />\nrushed through and that it<br />\nshould not be submitted to the<br />\nAcademic Council without fur-<br /><br />\nther work.<br />\nChuck Peifer,<br />\nStudent<br />\nCouncil<br />\npresident,<br />\nbrought up the fact that it had<br />\nnot been submitted to the<br />\nAcademic Council this year<br />\nbecause, practically, the Academic Council should have reviewed it immediately after it<br />\npassed CUS last year.<br />\nPeifer said, \"There was a<br />\nconcern the courses did not<br />\nexist\" and that work would have<br />\nto be done within the departments to broaden their course<br />\nselection.

We looic for students<br />\nwith many interests, and some<br />\nwith very few. Our main concern is to find someone who is<br />\nbright and can add something to<br />\nthe students body.\"<br />\nDespite wanting a diversified class, about one-third of<br />\nthose accepted will be interested<br /><br />\nin the natural sciences. \"We are<br />\nthe mecca of scientific studies,\"<br />\nSchnydman says, \"and the University wants to remain the<br />\nmecca of scientific studies.\" But<br />\nbecause one-half of the applicants to the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences are interested in the<br />\nsciences, competition is keen<br />\nand only about 35 percent of<br />\nthem will be admitted. About<br />\n60 percent of those interested in<br />\nthe Humanities will be admitted.<br />\nThe primary concern of the<br />\nUniversity in deciding who to<br />\nadmit is academic qualifications,<br />\nalthough nonacademic interests<br />\nalso play a role. Although the<br />\nUniversity is \"sex-blind\" in<br />\nadmitting students, Hopkins<br />\ndoes actively recruit female<br />\napplicants.

At present, the CUS is<br />\ncomprised of four students and<br />\nsix faculty representatives, none<br />\nof whom are members of the<br />\nAcademic Council. This proposal, passed by the CUS on<br />\nApril 1, has been forwarded to<br />\nthe Academic Council for approval.<br />\nCUS member Doug Fellman<br />\nbelieves that this measure will<br />\nbenefit the CUS. \"It will greatly<br />\nenhance the credibility of the<br />\nCUS when its proposals go<br />\nbefore the Academic Council,\"<br />\nhe said. Student Council president Chuck Peifer agrees that<br />\nthe lack of coordination between these two academic<br /><br />\nbodies contributes to the apparent disregard of many CUS<br />\nrecommendations by the Academic Council. \"CUS proposals<br />\ndon't seem to carry much weight<br />\nwith the Academic Council,\"<br />\nPeifer contends.<br />\nThe Academic Council has<br />\nnot yet put the CUS proposal on<br />\nits agenda. However, the council<br />\nis expected to consider this<br />\nmatter before the faculty appointments to the CUS are made<br />\nfor next year. Should the<br />\nAcademic Council approve the<br />\nCUS recommendation, the measure would take effect in September.<br />\nThe CUS hopes that this<br />\nmove will promote greater interaction - between the Academic<br />\nCouncil and the CUS in the<br />\nfuture. \"Currently there is no<br />\n,one kt the Academic C01.11161<br />\nlmeetings to represent the CUS<br />\nviews,\" explains Fellman. \"If<br />\nthis is approved, there will be<br />\n,two members there to lend<br />\nsupport.\" \u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\nPAGE 4 / APRIL 9,1982<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nGood Yuntov, Pontiff<br />\nThe News-Letter is published weekly during the school year by the<br />\nstudents of the Johns Hopkins University.

Sophomore class president Mike<br />\nKun played the devil's advocate, proposing<br />\nthat if the Student Council could represent<br />\nthe students on one political issue outside<br />\nHopkins, then it should be fully empowered to act as the students' political<br />\nrepresentatives on all such issues.<br />\nKun's point certainly can't be<br />\nargued with: by no means do we want<br />\nto have to worry about a student official's views on El Salvador or grain shipments to the Soviet Union.

Many members of the<br />\nwhich<br />\nAcademic Council sends tenure recommendations<br />\nto the Board of Trustees - are<br />\ncompletely satisfied with the<br />\nprocess. They argue that teaching is considered when deciding<br />\non a candidate for tenure and,<br />\nthough a candidate with impeccable research credentials probably won't be turned away<br />\nbecause of poor teaching or a<br />\nlack of commitment to undergraduates, otherwise solid candidates have in the past been<br />\nrejected on the basis of poor<br />\nteaching. This may be so. But<br />\nWere is no standard procedure,<br />\nbuilt into the current process,<br />\nfor linking teaching to tenure. If<br />\nenacted, the 40-letter requirement would represent on the<br />\npart of the University a true<br />\ncommitment to teaching. Further, the proposal is one way to<br />\ncompel faculty members to<br />\nassociate themselves with undergraduates.<br />\nThe 40-letter approach is<br />\nsimple and innocuous enough.<br />\nWe have proposed that professors who apply for tenure be<br />\nrequired to ask 40 of their<br />\nundergraduates to write a letter<br />\nattesting to that candidate's<br />\nteaching ability.

Second, if the<br />\nforty letters become a permanent part of the tenure process,<br />\nit will be a message to all new<br />\nfaculty members that this University takes seriously the teaching of its undergraduates.

As<br />\nwith the harvest, the weather can't be<br />\ncontrolled; precautions can be taken, and contingencies provided for, but if it really rains, everyone is screwed.<br />\n\"The Fair has always had an unwritten<br />\nagreement with God that it wouldn't rain,\" says<br />\nStudent Council president Chuck Peifer. \"Last<br />\nyear, He went back on the deal.\"<br />\nOf course the harvest analogy only goes so<br />\nfar-people on farms don't make reaping time an<br />\nopen house event for 150,000 city folks, while<br />\nthe Fair does. It was not only God who caused<br />\nheadaches for the Fair last year, but the seemingly inevitable combustion of huge crowds<br />\npacked into this small and usually placid campus. A report by the Student Council's Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee on Spring Fair ,documented only<br />\none incident of violence, in which a student was<br />\nthreatened at knife-point by a teenaged boy, but<br />\npeople close to the Fair mention other incidents,<br />\nand describe an increasingly unmanageable<br />\nsituation that was threatening to get totally out<br />\nof hand. Says Chris Colombo, the administration's Director of Student Services, \"The question everyone was asking was, 'How do you<br />\ncontrol that crowd out there, most of whom<br />\naren't students and most of whom are rowdy?'\"<br />\nThe result of these headaches, as Chuck<br />\nPeifer says, was that \"the Fair became vulnerable to attack from its long-time foes.\" Basically these foes were faculty members, who sent<br />\nletters complaining about the commercial<br />\natmosphere, the dangers of vandalism, the noise,<br />\nand the difficulties of working on weekends. At<br />\none point this fall, the Fair was in real danger of<br />\nbecoming a two day, non-musical event held<br />\nonly on the baseball field. However, the Student Council, in answer to these attacks by<br />\nfaculty members, proposed a complete ban of<br />\nrock music from the Fair, and a ban of any sort<br />\nof music from Gilman Quad during the Fair.<br />\nThis proposal has since been modified, but the<br />\nconflict has left a number of questions about the<br />\nnature of the Fair. It has on the one hand, left<br />\nruffled feathers and bad feelings among some<br />\npeople who feel Strongly about the presence of<br />\nmusic at the Fair. On the other hand, those who<br />\nview the Fair as a nuisance have complaints<br />\nwhich will linger for awhile, and which could<br />\nstill define the character of future Fairs. These<br />\npeople, primarily faculty, view the Fair as a<br />\ncommercial event, contrary to the spirit of a<br />\n\"student fair.\" Both sides have brought into<br />\nquestion the character of the Fair --what should<br />\n. it be, who is it for, and who should control it'?<br />\nThe Fair chairmen and the Student Council are<br />\nleft in the middle, with the task of answering<br />\ntheir questions and shaping the Fair. The results<br />\nmay<br />\n_. be taking the Fair in unexpected directions.<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\nHIS<br /><br />\n- Hasitgone commercial?<br /><br />\nThe first Fair was held in 1972, and<br />\nattracted a crowd of about 20,000 people over a<br />\nthree-day period. The idea for the Fair had<br />\ngrown out of a Student Council proposal the<br />\nyear before for a Fine Arts Festival, but even in<br />\nits first year, The Fair went beyond the \"fine<br />\narts\" and was conceived of more as a public<br />\nrelations gesture to the surrounding community.<br />\nIt s title, 3400 on Stage, was derived from the<br />\nschool's address, 3400 North Charles -thus,<br />\n\"Hopkins on Stage.\" An article in the News<br />\nAmerican in 1972 quotes the Fair's chairman of<br />\nthat year, Bobbi Nuttle, as saying:<br />\n\"The philosophy behind the festival is to<br />\npresent Johns Hopkins to surrounding neighborhoods by bringing members of the community<br />\non campus for three days that we hope will<br />\nprovide fun and active social contact.\"<br />\nAnd the Student Council president of that<br />\nyear, Gerald Bates, laid even greater stress on the<br />\nschool's relationship to the community:<br />\n\"Some students feel the University should<br /><br />\nhave a greater commitment to the community. traditional lines of the Fair.<br />\nIt's just the realization that you're living in an \u2022<br />\n\"Aside from the music changes, we're<br />\nurban environment; and you should be part of working with the basic structure of all the<br />\nit.<br />\nprevious Fairs we've seen,\" says Snyder. \"We<br />\nrun it a lot like a business because we have<br />\nto-it's that large, and we do have to worry<br />\nabout how much money we're bringing in. But<br />\nour main concern is that the students have a<br />\ngood time, and a lot of what we make goes<br />\ntoward the nighttime entertainment, which is<br />\nfor students only.\"<br />\nAnd Nimaroff adds that while getting<br />\nmore Hopkins people involved in the actual<br />\nentertainment itself \"would be a good idea,<br />\nsomething to work on for next year,\" he says<br />\nthat this year's Fair has had \"too many other<br />\nconcerns to deal with, such as appeasing the<br />\nfaculty.\"<br />\nBoth chairmen say that the administration<br />\nputs no pressure on them to make money or top<br />\nprevious profits. \"All we're told is that we have<br />\nto break even,\" says Snyder.<br />\nHowever, the Fair has undeniably been a<br />\nMike Nimaroff - Fair Chairman '82<br />\ncommercial vehicle in recent years for the<br />\nIt's interesting in light of the criticisms individual student activity groups who operate<br />\nthat the Fair .has become commercialized to concession stands, if not for the students runlook at the program for the '72 Fair, and see ning the Fair itself.

Much was the samerock music, concession booths, and a smattering<br />\nof carney rides. On the other hand, there was<br />\nmore of an emphasis on displaying Hopkins<br />\nitself: exhibits, lectures, and tours by the Metro<br />\nCenter and the physics and archaeology departments; art collections owned by Hopkins faculty<br />\nand alumni; several intercollegiate athletic<br />\nevents; student plays and poetry readings; and<br />\nan equal representation of music by students,<br />\nsome from Hopkins, others from Peabody and<br />\nTowson State.<br />\nToday, of course, the Fair attracts a<br />\ncrowd nearly eight times as large. The entertainment features more people from the outside --big<br />\nname comedians and musical groups, the full<br />\ngamut of carney rides in the freshman quad. On<br />\nthe other hand, as this year's Fair chairmen<br />\npoint out, more students than ever before are<br />\ninvolved in the running of the Fair.<br />\n\"If you total up students working on the<br />\nFair, and student groups working booths, you<br />\nprobably have about a quarter of the school<br />\ninvolved in the Fair,\" says co-chairman Mike<br />\nNimaroff. \"It's quite an experience to be<br />\ninvolved in the running of something like this.\"<br />\nWhile recent Fairs have certainly been<br />\nmore of \"an event\" than their predecessors,<br />\nthere have been objections to them simply on<br />\naesthetic grounds alone.<br />\n\"I don't enjoy the Fairs, anymore, and it<br />\nseems to me I used to,\" says Professor Dean<br />\nRobinson, chairman of the Chemistry Department. \"The quality of the exhibits have gone<br />\ndown- there used to be better things to look at,<br />\nbetter music and more cultural exhibits.

Despite all that,<br />\nPeter Scott tossed in a goal 17<br />\nseconds into overtime, giving the<br />\nBlue Jays their fifth win of the<br />\nseason last Saturday over Virginia, 12-11.<br />\nThe start of the overtime<br />\nperiod wasn't unlike most of<br />\nregulation play. The Cavaliers<br />\nwere able to control the ball<br />\nafter the face off and drove<br />\nstraight into Hopkins territory.<br />\nThis time around, however,<br />\nthe outcome was slightly different. During the game, more<br />\noften than not, goals resulted<br />\nfrom these fast breaks, but this<br />\ntime the ball was jarred loose<br />\nand Marty Bergin scooped it up<br />\nand charged upfield, tossing a<br />\nperfect pass to Pete Scott for the<br />\nwinning goal.<br />\nSaturday's game was only<br />\npartly similar to a usual Blue Jay<br />\ngame. The attack unit of Jeff<br />\nCook, Pete Scott, and Mike<br />\nDonnelly scored ten times, but<br />\nthat's just about it. The first<br />\nmidfield unit of Henry Ciccarone, Jr., John Krumenacker,<br />\nand Bill Cantelli were good for<br />\nonly one goal, and to make<br />\nmatters worse, the second midfield was only able to get three<br /><br />\nshots on goal the entire afternoon. Those statistics tell the<br />\nstory of the whole game.<br />\nThe whole contest was a<br />\nseesaw battle, but in an unusual<br />\nwhile the Blue Jays<br />\nway:<br />\ncontrolled the play in the first<br />\nand third quarters, Virginia was<br />\nequally strong the remaining<br />\ntime. After jumping out to a<br />\n4-1 lead in the driving rain of the<br />\nfirst quarter, the defensive unit<br />\nallowed five unanswered goals in<br />\nthe sun of the second quarter,<br />\nand when the dust settled the<br />\nscore was tied at six.<br />\nAfter the teams returned<br />\nfrom the locker room, the only<br />\nnoticeable difference was that<br />\nthis time around the sun was<br />\nshining brightly, and as things<br />\nstarted up, it looked like a<br />\nrepeat of the first half. The<br />\nJays dominated the action, once<br />\nagain taking a commanding lead<br />\ninto the fourth quarter. As<br />\nalways, most of the scoring was<br />\nfrom up front, but that was<br />\ngood enough for the situation,<br />\nconsidering the lead. Then as<br />\nthe whistle blew, starting the<br />\nsecond half, the Cavaliers started<br />\nto slow the game down. They<br />\nbecame more deliberate, and<br />\nworked the ball around looking<br />\nfor the open shot, denying<br />\nHopkins the chance to score,<br />\nand that tactic was good for<br />\nthree goals. The Blue Jays had<br />\nbarely touched the ball the<br />\nwhole quarter. So with under<br />\ntwo minutes to go, the teams<br />\nwere deadlocked at 11.<br />\nThe final chance the Blue<br />\nJays had was with about one and<br />\na half minutes to go in the game,<br />\nas Henry Ciccarone took the ball<br /><br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nFriday, April 9<br />\nGolf vs. Western Md. at Franklin &amp; Marshall :00 p.m.(A)<br />\n3.00 p.m.(H)<br />\nMen's Tennis vs. UM13C<br />\np.m.(A)<br />\n4-00<br />\nWomen's Lacrosse vs. Haverford<br />\nSaturday, April 10<br />\n2:00 p.m.(H)<br />\nMen's Lacrosse vs. North Carolina<br />\n1:00 p.m.(A)<br />\nBaseball vs. Ursinus(2)<br />\np.m.(H)<br />\n1:00<br />\n(V&amp;JV)<br />\nMd.<br />\nWomen's Lacrosse vs. Western<br />\nTuesday, April 13<br />\n1 .00 p.m.(A)<br />\nGolf vs. Phila.

To satisfy nly<br />\ncuriosity, I recently posed<br />\nsome of my questions to Ferdinand Nebbish, an expert on the<br />\nmany nuances of sports.<br />\nHave you ever wondered<br />\nwhy hockey players \"change on<br />\nthe fly?\" Well, according to<br />\nNebbish, the expression arose in<br />\nthe 1920's when Irving Blintze<br />\nbroke the zipper on his uniform.<br />\nUntil that time, substitutions<br />\nwere allowed only on whistles.<br />\nHowever, Blintze, too embarrassed to continue playing with<br />\nhis fly open, headed for the<br />\nbench and a substitute came on<br />\nthe ice for him. At first, the<br />\nreferee was going to call a<br />\npenalty, but he decided that<br />\nbecause Blintze had a broken<br />\nzipper, the substitution was<br />\njustified. From that point on,<br />\nwhenever a player became tired<br />\nand wanted to ga to the bench,<br />\nhe just . opened \".4.6 zipper. In<br />\n1945, to prevent this maneuver,<br />\nuniforms were Aade without<br />\nzippers. Nevertheless, one year<br />\nlater, the National Hockey<br />\nLeague decided to allow teams<br />\nto substitute freely, or in modern hockey jargon, change on<br />\nthe fly.<br /><br />\nAfter remaining healthy for<br />\nthe past few seasons, this year's<br />\nsquad has been hit with quite a<br />\nfew injuries. It is questionable<br />\nwhether captain and shortstop<br />\nBill Stromberg, who is suffering<br />\nfrom a pulled groin, will play at<br />\nall this year. Third baseman<br />\nMark Crowe is out indefinitely<br />\nwith hepatitis, and first baseman<br />\nBob Martino, who had been<br />\nhitting .357, is suffering a pulled<br />\nhamstring and his status will be<br />\ndetermined on a game by game<br /><br />\nbasis. This leaves the team with<br />\nonly a single third baseman,<br />\nshortstop, and second baseman.<br />\nThe Jays have been forced to use<br />\na pair of freshmen at third and<br />\nshort, Bob Cardwell and Tom<br />\nHarmon.. It is very difficult for<br />\nplayers to step right in and play<br />\nsolid infield at the college level.<br />\nThe two have had some defensive trouble and, not surprisingly, both are also playing with<br />\npulled groins.<br />\nA look at the hitting statistics shows that Andy Lachance<br />\nhas clearly been the batting star<br />\nof the team, with a .400 average<br />\nand a team-leading nine RBI's.<br />\nBut besides the injured Martino,<br />\nnone of the other Jay starters<br />\nare hitting above .300.
