After graduating<br />\nfrom Wheaton College in<br />\n<br />\nElliot Coleman<br />\n<br />\nIllinois, he was head of the<br />\nEnglish department at a<br />\nprivate school in Asheville,<br />\nNorth Carolina.<br />\nThen came a stint as a<br />\ngraduate student in theology<br />\nat the Princeton Seminary.<br />\nThe ministry did not appeal to<br />\nhim, so Coleman forsook the<br />\ncloth in favor of the book<br />\njacket.<br />\nHe entered- the publishing<br />\nworld of New York, and<br />\neventually came to hold three<br />\nsimultaneous positions at the<br />\nfirm of Doubleday. Here he<br />\nwas an assistant editor, the<br />\nhead of a printing plant and<br />\nthe organizer of a school for<br />\nwomen employees of the<br />\nLiterary Guild.<br />\nAt this point, Coleman was<br />\nsuddenly called to Hopkins,<br />\nwhere a friend of his, a<br />\npolitical science professor,<br />\nhad recommended him to<br />\nteach creative writing.<br />\nThe need for such a person<br />\nwas created by a sudden<br />\ninflux of returning GI's who<br />\nall wanted to write their<br />\nmemoirs. There was only<br />\none other school in the<br />\ncountry, the University of<br />\nIowa, where training in<br />\nwriting could be procured at.<br />\nthe time..<br />\nFrom this beginning, the<br />\nWriting Seminars evolved. \"I<br />\nhad some remarkable undergraduates in my courses,\"<br />\nColeman recollected. Some of<br />\nthe best writers have been<br />\nmajors in science, math and<br />\n<br />\npre-med. Our first exciting<br />\nRussell<br />\nwas<br />\nstudent<br />\nBaker.He didn't say much-sat in the back of the class,<br />\nbut his writing had power.\"<br />\nBaker went on to become a<br />\nreporter for the Baltimore<br />\nSun, and now holds down the<br />\nposition of \"social critic \"for<br />\nthe New York Times.<br />\nThe Writing Seminars<br />\nalumnus who has attained the<br />\ngreatest literary prominance<br />\nhas been John Barth, who<br />\nstudied here in the early<br />\nfifties. \"We were very much<br />\nexcited by his work,\"<br />\nColeman says.<br />\nNowadays, the full time<br />\nstaff of the Seminars consists<br />\nof two other people besides<br />\nProfessor Coleman, these<br />\nbeing Michael Lynch, Lecturer in Fiction, and Stephen<br />\nWiest, Lecturer in Poetry and<br />\nEnglish Writing. Coleman<br />\nsaid he \"admired Mr. Lynch<br />\nand Mr. Wiest both very<br />\nmuch, and actively sought<br />\nthem for my staff.\"<br />\nIn addition, there are<br />\ntwelve full time Teaching<br />\nFellows, graduate students<br />\nputting in one year's<br />\nresidence required for the<br />\nM.A. in Creative Writing. All<br />\ntogether, forty graduate<br />\nstudents are under the aegis<br />\nof the Writing Seminars.<br />\nColeman noted with dismay<br />\nthe plight, both commercial<br />\nand artistic, of the writer in<br />\nAmerica today. \"Poetry,\" he<br />\nadmits, \"doesn't have much<br />\ncommercial appeal. Very few<br />\npoets have ever made any<br />\nmoney.<br />\n\"Very few novelists today<br />\nhistory history<br />\nwords in .the water<br />\ndisse ntbling<br />\n<br />\nhave become self-sufficient<br />\nfrom sales alone. Most have<br />\nto teach. The average income<br />\nfor novelists in America-unless they are very very<br />\nfamous--is<br />\nabout eight<br />\nthousand dollars a year. \"I<br />\nthink books that are sensationally pushed don't<br />\namount to anything. It is a<br />\ngame--and in every human<br />\nactivity there is a temptation<br />\nto play the game.

It is the<br />\nstudent, as usual, who is getting short-changed. Just as<br />\nthe administration thinks the answer to its fiscal crisis is<br />\nto boost tuition for already overburdened students, the<br />\nParking Committee thinks the solution to the parking<br />\ncrisis is to not provide students with spaces.<br />\nAs long as the crisis persists why not treat all members of the community as equals. The three-quarters of<br />\na mile rule, which entitles those students who live more<br />\nthan three-quarters of a mile away from campus to<br />\nsecure parking privileges, is fair under the circumstances. But why not apply the same rule to administrators, faculty and employees, many of whom<br />\n'live within the three-quarter mile radius.

It also provides a real danger to the maintenance of basic civil liberties. At a time when campus<br />\nmovements are providing the major thrust for social<br />\nchange, it is only natural for those in power to take<br />\nextreme measures to protect their own interests-always under the guise of democracy.<br />\nThe frightening thing is that the ploy usually works.<br />\n\"Democracy\" is an awesome word, and combined with<br />\n\"Law and Order\" and an election year, the trio becomes<br />\nunbeatable.<br />\n<br />\nThe U.A.W.

STEPHEN PEPPER<br />\nAt this very moment Baltimore is the<br />\nscene of a major political event in our<br />\nsociety: the United Auto Workers' strike<br />\nagainst General Motors. Approximately<br />\n5000 workers at the GM plant here have<br />\njoined the more than 350,000 workers in the<br />\nUnited States and Canada who have left their,<br />\njobs to strike for vital economic demands.<br />\nThe U.A.W.'s three major demands:<br />\nacorss the board pay increase, which would<br />\nrstore the pay that the workers have lost due<br />\nto inflation since 1966, restoration of an<br />\nunlimited cost of living scale that would keep<br />\nup with the inflation, and a pension plan<br />\nknown as \"thirty and out\" wherein workers<br />\nwould be able to retire after thirty years<br />\nwork with a $500.00 monthly pension.<br />\nThe cost of living escalator has become a<br />\nmajor issue. The key demand, therefore,<br />\nthrusts the question of inflation into the<br />\ncenter of the dispute.<br />\nIf the strike really revolves around inflation, then the causes and cures of inflation<br />\nplay an essential part in its politics. The<br />\ntheory of management appears to be that<br />\ninflation is caused by an over-stimulated<br />\neconomy that needs cooling off.<br />\nA crucial part of this process is holding the<br />\nline against workers' wages, because these<br />\nincreases extend inflation in two ways:<br />\nFirst, the increased buying power of the<br />\nworkers continues to heat up the economy.<br />\nSecond, the rising cost to management must<br />\nbe passed on to the consumer in increased<br />\nprices. Hence, you have the cycle known as<br />\nthe \"cost-push\" theory.<br />\nRepublican and Democratic candidates<br />\nare presently debating the best policis to<br />\nimplement anti-inflation measures based on<br />\nthis theory. The Republicans have favored<br />\nthe more invisible techniques of controling<br />\ncredit and currency.<br />\nDemocrats have argued that this policyhas<br />\nfailed and many of them are calling for<br />\nwage-price controls. For example, Senator<br />\nTydings wrote in his campaign literature,<br />\n\"To curb inflation...the president must<br />\npersonally become involved in the fight to<br />\nhold price and wage increases to reasonable<br />\nlevels. It is imperative that he set wage and<br />\nprice guidelines and use the full force of his<br />\noffice.\"<br />\nThis is the core of Tydings' policy, but to<br />\nmake it more platable he calls for an end to<br />\nthe credit squeeze and an end to the war and<br />\nto inflated military spending.<br />\nThe Tydings package introduces the new<br />\nelement of the war and military spending,<br />\nwhich have become the rallying cries of a<br />\nmiddle-class mass movement of \"effete<br />\nsnobs\". In this approach, the war is singled<br />\nout as the cause of inflation. Rank and file<br />\nworkers have been condemned with their<br />\nboses as profiting from the war. This explanation is advanced by both liberal<br />\nDemocrats and radials.<br />\n<br />\nHence, an alliance has developed, albeit<br />\nan unwitting one, in which the peace<br />\nmovement and even the radical movement<br />\nconcurs in a theory that can only lead to the<br />\nanti-labor policy of attacking wages and jobs<br />\nas a means to solve inflation.<br />\nFurther, all of this is done in the noble<br />\ncause of ending the war. To see this more<br />\nclearly we must examine the major shortcomings of the cost-push theory.<br />\nThere are many pertinent facts that this<br />\ntheory fails to explain. But the one that is<br />\nmost important to labor people is that the<br />\nreal wages of workers have been on the<br />\ndecline since 1965.<br />\nThe second point the cost push theory<br />\noverlooks is that the inflation has continued<br />\nduring a period when demand was not<br />\nsharply on the rise. The conumer price<br />\nindex rose at the same time that most retail<br />\nstores were reporting a disastrous decline in<br />\nsales, and were struggling to reduce inventories. In fact, there has been a decline<br />\nin consumer production.<br />\nWe are presently faced with a seemingly<br />\nirreconcilable problem. Prices rise although<br />\nconsumer buying has fallen off. Real wages<br />\ndo not keep pace with the rising cost of<br />\nliving. And although profits are inflated the<br />\nPenn Central has gone bankrupt and the<br />\nChryslter Corp. totters.<br />\nFinally, everyone of us experiences the<br />\ndecline in the quality of services, whether it<br />\nis the reduction of teaching staffs in the<br />\nUniversity or the collapse of railroad and<br />\ntelephone facilities in the cities. What is the<br />\nmissing factor that could make intelligible<br />\nthe rising chaos?<br />\nThe evidence points overwhelmingly to the<br />\ndecline in the real productivity of the<br />\neconomy that has been proceeding<br />\nunchecked throughout this decade. The<br />\nreason this decline has not been analyzed<br />\nmore fully is that the economy gives the<br />\nappearance of health when we read that the<br />\nG.N.P. is reaching the trillion dollar mark,<br />\nand when we hear that inflation is caused by<br />\nover-stimulation, as if the economy were a<br />\nfrisky colt.<br />\nHigh profits have been maintained in the<br />\nunproductive areas of military and<br />\naerospace spending (unproductive because<br />\nthey do not contribute to the maintenance of<br />\nthe needs of life.) Until recently, investment<br />\naborad provided high returns. Finally,<br />\ncapital activity has been stimulated at the<br />\nprice of a mountain of debt, federal, state,<br />\nmunicipal and personal.<br />\nThe Penn Central's inability to keep its<br />\nobligations is one example of the mortgaged<br />\nstate of our economy. If we had the figures<br />\nwe would probably learn that this University's deficit is partly due to debt service on<br />\nthe bonds it floated to build hospital<br />\nfacilities and to pay for other capital improvements.<br />\n(continued on page 8)<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nZionist Activists<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn reading your article<br />\nabout the Zionist Activists on<br />\nthis campus, and how they<br />\n\"see themselves as part of a<br />\nradical tradition\", and how<br />\n\"We<br />\ndon't<br />\nsupport<br />\neverything Israel does'\", and<br />\nabout which radicals are antisemetic and which are not, I<br />\nask myself the following<br />\nquestions: Where were these<br />\nradial Zionist Activists when<br />\nMr. Uri Avneri, member of<br />\nthe Israeli Parliament, and<br />\nthe loyal opposition to Mrs.<br />\nMeir, spoke last Sunday on<br />\ncampus?<br />\n<br />\nWhere were they when he<br />\nsystematically outlined his<br />\nviews for a peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli<br />\nconflict?

The<br />\nhistory of play between these two teams is<br />\nextremely short, only two years. Hopkins<br />\nhas won both of these contests 30-28 and 3021. The Mules will be fielding a team with<br />\n40 returning lettermen and could make<br />\nthings rough for the Jays.<br />\nThe question is very basic. It is simply a<br />\nmatter of whether or not the Jays have the<br />\nteam to get out on the field and win. At the<br />\nbeginning of every year a sportwriter can<br />\nget one of two answers out the average<br />\nfootball coach:<br />\n*\"This is a rebuilding year.\"<br />\n*\"This will be a great year.\"<br />\nWith Hopkins it<br />\nthe same<br />\nis<br />\nstory. The general feelings of Coach Sotir<br />\nare that while this may not be the best<br />\nteam we have ever had, it has to be one of<br />\nthe best spiritied. Gone are the days of the<br />\nJoe Cowan type one-man team. This team<br />\nhas to win on desire.<br />\nLast year the quarterback of the varsity<br />\nwas Bob Pfieffer. There were questions at<br />\ntimes as to whether or not Bob was<br />\ncapable of doing a good job.<br />\nThe answer seems \u2022 to be yes. The<br />\nteam did a fantastic job in the first<br />\nscrimmage against Lebanon Valley when<br />\nboth teams played<br />\nwithout lines or<br />\ntackling.<br />\nYet theteam's weakness came out when<br />\na full scrimmage was played in the after<br />\nnoon. It turns out that while in the<br />\n<br />\nThen, the quarterback spent a lot of<br />\ntime collecting grass stains on his back.<br />\nTeam Weakness<br />\nThe problem last year was basically<br />\nthat the Jays had no offensive line. This<br />\ncost the team a lot of ppints and when the<br />\noutstanding members of the offense<br />\nwere<br />\nwith injuries later<br />\nplagued<br />\nin the season it was understandable.<br />\nIf there is one thing Bob Pfieffer<br />\ndeserves credit for last year it was simply<br />\nhaving the guts to stay in the game. It was<br />\nunfortunate that he had to spend so much<br />\ntime on his back but the offensive line<br />\ndoomed him to that fate.<br />\nSo again this year we hear that the Jays<br />\nhave perhaps the best offensive backfield<br />\nin the league and should have no trouble<br />\nchurning out points. There are two first<br />\nrate quarterbacks in Pfieffer and Jim<br />\nPitts, good receivers in Dave Pickall, Tim<br />\nWeglicki, Bill\" Donovan, and Les Matthews, and good runners in Steve Hata,<br />\nDan Augustine, Joe Cieslowski, and Pat<br />\nNeary.<br />\nAgain the question is the offensive line<br />\nbecause no matter how good the offensive<br />\nbackfield is it needs a line to spring runners and to give the quarterbacks time<br />\nenough to pass. It means that there has to<br />\nbe someone<br />\nto<br />\nline<br />\nlead<br />\nthe<br />\nand this someone seems to be senior<br />\ncenter Gus Slotman.<br />\nIf Gus can give the line the leadership it<br />\nneeds it can make the difference between<br />\na mediocre season like last year and a true<br />\nchampionship.<br />\n<br />\n\f170<br />\n<br />\nPage 11<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nSeptember 25, 1970<br />\n<br />\nPrimary Races Still in Doubt;<br />\nMishaps Under Investigation<br />\nhoped there wouldn't be any.<br />\nThe count went on in an<br />\natmosphere of fear and<br />\nsuspicion.<br />\nCity police have been on an<br />\ninformal alert since last<br />\nTuesday's primary.

After graduating<br />\nfrom Wheaton College in<br /><br />\nElliot Coleman<br /><br />\nIllinois, he was head of the<br />\nEnglish department at a<br />\nprivate school in Asheville,<br />\nNorth Carolina.<br />\nThen came a stint as a<br />\ngraduate student in theology<br />\nat the Princeton Seminary.<br />\nThe ministry did not appeal to<br />\nhim, so Coleman forsook the<br />\ncloth in favor of the book<br />\njacket.<br />\nHe entered- the publishing<br />\nworld of New York, and<br />\neventually came to hold three<br />\nsimultaneous positions at the<br />\nfirm of Doubleday. Here he<br />\nwas an assistant editor, the<br />\nhead of a printing plant and<br />\nthe organizer of a school for<br />\nwomen employees of the<br />\nLiterary Guild.<br />\nAt this point, Coleman was<br />\nsuddenly called to Hopkins,<br />\nwhere a friend of his, a<br />\npolitical science professor,<br />\nhad recommended him to<br />\nteach creative writing.<br />\nThe need for such a person<br />\nwas created by a sudden<br />\ninflux of returning GI's who<br />\nall wanted to write their<br />\nmemoirs. There was only<br />\none other school in the<br />\ncountry, the University of<br />\nIowa, where training in<br />\nwriting could be procured at.<br />\nthe time..<br />\nFrom this beginning, the<br />\nWriting Seminars evolved. \"I<br />\nhad some remarkable undergraduates in my courses,\"<br />\nColeman recollected. Some of<br />\nthe best writers have been<br />\nmajors in science, math and<br /><br />\npre-med. Our first exciting<br />\nRussell<br />\nwas<br />\nstudent<br />\nBaker.He didn't say much-sat in the back of the class,<br />\nbut his writing had power.\"<br />\nBaker went on to become a<br />\nreporter for the Baltimore<br />\nSun, and now holds down the<br />\nposition of \"social critic \"for<br />\nthe New York Times.<br />\nThe Writing Seminars<br />\nalumnus who has attained the<br />\ngreatest literary prominance<br />\nhas been John Barth, who<br />\nstudied here in the early<br />\nfifties. \"We were very much<br />\nexcited by his work,\"<br />\nColeman says.<br />\nNowadays, the full time<br />\nstaff of the Seminars consists<br />\nof two other people besides<br />\nProfessor Coleman, these<br />\nbeing Michael Lynch, Lecturer in Fiction, and Stephen<br />\nWiest, Lecturer in Poetry and<br />\nEnglish Writing. Coleman<br />\nsaid he \"admired Mr. Lynch<br />\nand Mr. Wiest both very<br />\nmuch, and actively sought<br />\nthem for my staff.\"<br />\nIn addition, there are<br />\ntwelve full time Teaching<br />\nFellows, graduate students<br />\nputting in one year's<br />\nresidence required for the<br />\nM.A. in Creative Writing. All<br />\ntogether, forty graduate<br />\nstudents are under the aegis<br />\nof the Writing Seminars.<br />\nColeman noted with dismay<br />\nthe plight, both commercial<br />\nand artistic, of the writer in<br />\nAmerica today. \"Poetry,\" he<br />\nadmits, \"doesn't have much<br />\ncommercial appeal. Very few<br />\npoets have ever made any<br />\nmoney.<br />\n\"Very few novelists today<br />\nhistory history<br />\nwords in .the water<br />\ndisse ntbling<br /><br />\nhave become self-sufficient<br />\nfrom sales alone. Most have<br />\nto teach. The average income<br />\nfor novelists in America-unless they are very very<br />\nfamous--is<br />\nabout eight<br />\nthousand dollars a year. \"I<br />\nthink books that are sensationally pushed don't<br />\namount to anything. It is a<br />\ngame--and in every human<br />\nactivity there is a temptation<br />\nto play the game. Thus, we<br />\nhave the Prose Biz and the<br />\nPoetry Biz.\"<br />\n\"The Government should<br />\nmake funds available to<br />\npeople who are good writers,<br />\nwithout the threat of censorship.<br />\n\"The Writing Seminars are<br />\ngrateful to Johns Hopkins for<br />\ngiving them the freedom that<br />\nthey need.

I<br />\nhave learned far more from<br />\nmy students and colleagues<br />\nthan- I have taught them.\"<br />\nLast year, a committee was<br />\nappointed to consider the fate<br />\nof a Coleman-less Writing<br />\nSeminar. It may yet be incorporated within the English<br />\nDepartment, but no definite<br />\nplans have been formed.<br />\nOne fact was clear--that<br />\nwithout its guiding genius, the<br />\nprogram would be placed in<br />\njeopardy. Dr. William<br />\nMcLain,<br />\nGerman,<br />\nthe<br />\ncommittee chairman, observed last year, \"He is it in<br />\nWriting Seminars.

What bothers us is, in addition to the<br />\nproblem per se, is the way in which it is being handled.<br />\nThe Campus Traffic and Parking Regulations,<br />\npublished as an advertisement in the News-Letter last<br />\nweek, were arrived at by a faculty and administrationOne employee, one undominated committee.<br />\ndergraduate and one graduate student sat on the panel,<br />\nchaired by Professor Carl Christ.<br />\nChrist said that students were welcome to address the<br />\ncommittee, but no students were invited and only one,<br />\nHarry Singleton appeared. He presented a plan which<br />\nthe News-Letter endorses providing for elimination of<br />\npreferential treatment in the consignment of available<br />\nparking spaces.<br />\nFaculty, administrators and employees have been<br />\naccorded more than their share of spaces. It is the<br />\nstudent, as usual, who is getting short-changed. Just as<br />\nthe administration thinks the answer to its fiscal crisis is<br />\nto boost tuition for already overburdened students, the<br />\nParking Committee thinks the solution to the parking<br />\ncrisis is to not provide students with spaces.<br />\nAs long as the crisis persists why not treat all members of the community as equals. The three-quarters of<br />\na mile rule, which entitles those students who live more<br />\nthan three-quarters of a mile away from campus to<br />\nsecure parking privileges, is fair under the circumstances. But why not apply the same rule to administrators, faculty and employees, many of whom<br />\n'live within the three-quarter mile radius. The word is<br />\nthat they walk as well as students.<br />\nAnd to help ease the problem itself, why not use some<br />\nof the land next to Garland Hall for a gravel parking lot.<br />\nThe administration building has already ruined the.<br />\naesthetics of that part of the campus, and there<br />\nwould still be enough room for those who care to indulge<br />\nin sports.<br /><br />\nNixon Plan,<br />\nFBI On Campus<br />\nPresident Nixon's proposal that Congress give federal<br />\nauthorities the power to intervene in cases of extreme<br />\ndisturbances on college campuses, without securing the<br />\npermission of campus authorities, is dangerous to say<br />\nthe least. The creation of an additional 1,000 posts at the<br />\nFBI to handle campus outbreaks is a tactic of sheer<br />\nintimidation.<br />\nNixon's proposal provides for automatic federal intervention in cases of bombings, arson and terrorist<br />\nactivities. It also provides a real danger to the maintenance of basic civil liberties. At a time when campus<br />\nmovements are providing the major thrust for social<br />\nchange, it is only natural for those in power to take<br />\nextreme measures to protect their own interests-always under the guise of democracy.<br />\nThe frightening thing is that the ploy usually works.<br />\n\"Democracy\" is an awesome word, and combined with<br />\n\"Law and Order\" and an election year, the trio becomes<br />\nunbeatable.<br /><br />\nThe U.A.W. Strike<br />\nBy DR. STEPHEN PEPPER<br />\nAt this very moment Baltimore is the<br />\nscene of a major political event in our<br />\nsociety: the United Auto Workers' strike<br />\nagainst General Motors. Approximately<br />\n5000 workers at the GM plant here have<br />\njoined the more than 350,000 workers in the<br />\nUnited States and Canada who have left their,<br />\njobs to strike for vital economic demands.<br />\nThe U.A.W.'s three major demands:<br />\nacorss the board pay increase, which would<br />\nrstore the pay that the workers have lost due<br />\nto inflation since 1966, restoration of an<br />\nunlimited cost of living scale that would keep<br />\nup with the inflation, and a pension plan<br />\nknown as \"thirty and out\" wherein workers<br />\nwould be able to retire after thirty years<br />\nwork with a $500.00 monthly pension.<br />\nThe cost of living escalator has become a<br />\nmajor issue. The key demand, therefore,<br />\nthrusts the question of inflation into the<br />\ncenter of the dispute.<br />\nIf the strike really revolves around inflation, then the causes and cures of inflation<br />\nplay an essential part in its politics. The<br />\ntheory of management appears to be that<br />\ninflation is caused by an over-stimulated<br />\neconomy that needs cooling off.<br />\nA crucial part of this process is holding the<br />\nline against workers' wages, because these<br />\nincreases extend inflation in two ways:<br />\nFirst, the increased buying power of the<br />\nworkers continues to heat up the economy.<br />\nSecond, the rising cost to management must<br />\nbe passed on to the consumer in increased<br />\nprices. Hence, you have the cycle known as<br />\nthe \"cost-push\" theory.<br />\nRepublican and Democratic candidates<br />\nare presently debating the best policis to<br />\nimplement anti-inflation measures based on<br />\nthis theory. The Republicans have favored<br />\nthe more invisible techniques of controling<br />\ncredit and currency.<br />\nDemocrats have argued that this policyhas<br />\nfailed and many of them are calling for<br />\nwage-price controls. For example, Senator<br />\nTydings wrote in his campaign literature,<br />\n\"To curb inflation...the president must<br />\npersonally become involved in the fight to<br />\nhold price and wage increases to reasonable<br />\nlevels. It is imperative that he set wage and<br />\nprice guidelines and use the full force of his<br />\noffice.\"<br />\nThis is the core of Tydings' policy, but to<br />\nmake it more platable he calls for an end to<br />\nthe credit squeeze and an end to the war and<br />\nto inflated military spending.<br />\nThe Tydings package introduces the new<br />\nelement of the war and military spending,<br />\nwhich have become the rallying cries of a<br />\nmiddle-class mass movement of \"effete<br />\nsnobs\". In this approach, the war is singled<br />\nout as the cause of inflation. Rank and file<br />\nworkers have been condemned with their<br />\nboses as profiting from the war. This explanation is advanced by both liberal<br />\nDemocrats and radials.<br /><br />\nHence, an alliance has developed, albeit<br />\nan unwitting one, in which the peace<br />\nmovement and even the radical movement<br />\nconcurs in a theory that can only lead to the<br />\nanti-labor policy of attacking wages and jobs<br />\nas a means to solve inflation.<br />\nFurther, all of this is done in the noble<br />\ncause of ending the war. To see this more<br />\nclearly we must examine the major shortcomings of the cost-push theory.<br />\nThere are many pertinent facts that this<br />\ntheory fails to explain. But the one that is<br />\nmost important to labor people is that the<br />\nreal wages of workers have been on the<br />\ndecline since 1965.<br />\nThe second point the cost push theory<br />\noverlooks is that the inflation has continued<br />\nduring a period when demand was not<br />\nsharply on the rise. The conumer price<br />\nindex rose at the same time that most retail<br />\nstores were reporting a disastrous decline in<br />\nsales, and were struggling to reduce inventories. In fact, there has been a decline<br />\nin consumer production.<br />\nWe are presently faced with a seemingly<br />\nirreconcilable problem. Prices rise although<br />\nconsumer buying has fallen off. Real wages<br />\ndo not keep pace with the rising cost of<br />\nliving. And although profits are inflated the<br />\nPenn Central has gone bankrupt and the<br />\nChryslter Corp. totters.<br />\nFinally, everyone of us experiences the<br />\ndecline in the quality of services, whether it<br />\nis the reduction of teaching staffs in the<br />\nUniversity or the collapse of railroad and<br />\ntelephone facilities in the cities. What is the<br />\nmissing factor that could make intelligible<br />\nthe rising chaos?<br />\nThe evidence points overwhelmingly to the<br />\ndecline in the real productivity of the<br />\neconomy that has been proceeding<br />\nunchecked throughout this decade. The<br />\nreason this decline has not been analyzed<br />\nmore fully is that the economy gives the<br />\nappearance of health when we read that the<br />\nG.N.P. is reaching the trillion dollar mark,<br />\nand when we hear that inflation is caused by<br />\nover-stimulation, as if the economy were a<br />\nfrisky colt.<br />\nHigh profits have been maintained in the<br />\nunproductive areas of military and<br />\naerospace spending (unproductive because<br />\nthey do not contribute to the maintenance of<br />\nthe needs of life.) Until recently, investment<br />\naborad provided high returns. Finally,<br />\ncapital activity has been stimulated at the<br />\nprice of a mountain of debt, federal, state,<br />\nmunicipal and personal.<br />\nThe Penn Central's inability to keep its<br />\nobligations is one example of the mortgaged<br />\nstate of our economy. If we had the figures<br />\nwe would probably learn that this University's deficit is partly due to debt service on<br />\nthe bonds it floated to build hospital<br />\nfacilities and to pay for other capital improvements.<br />\n(continued on page 8)<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nZionist Activists<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn reading your article<br />\nabout the Zionist Activists on<br />\nthis campus, and how they<br />\n\"see themselves as part of a<br />\nradical tradition\", and how<br />\n\"We<br />\ndon't<br />\nsupport<br />\neverything Israel does'\", and<br />\nabout which radicals are antisemetic and which are not, I<br />\nask myself the following<br />\nquestions: Where were these<br />\nradial Zionist Activists when<br />\nMr. Uri Avneri, member of<br />\nthe Israeli Parliament, and<br />\nthe loyal opposition to Mrs.<br />\nMeir, spoke last Sunday on<br />\ncampus?<br /><br />\nWhere were they when he<br />\nsystematically outlined his<br />\nviews for a peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli<br />\nconflict?

He<br />\nreached up and turned every<br />\nspotlight he could reach on<br />\nhimself.<br />\n\"Need all the light I can<br />\nget,\" he said quietly and<br />\n, before the crowd had stopped<br />\nmurmuring its approval he<br />\nwas off on a screaming<br />\ntwelve bars of guitarwork<br />\nthat left no doubt as to who<br />\nwould be running the show.<br />\nWhen the people heard the<br />\nfirst piercing notes of Berry's<br />\nintroduction, they froze.<br />\nNothing had prepared them<br />\nfor the fiery energy pouring<br />\nout of his amps.<br />\nGunny Sack<br />\nWhen it was clear that the<br />\nsong was \"Memphis\", the<br />\npeople were clapping in<br />\nunison and stamping their<br />\nfeet.

With no wah-wah<br />\npedals, fuzz boxes or tremelo,<br />\nBerry has only the basic tools<br />\nof the early rock and roll<br />\nstars--simple tunes, lots of<br />\nelectricity, rhythms<br />\nevocative of primordial<br />\nsexual ecstacies and his own<br />\nimpeccable sense of timing<br />\nand showmanship.<br />\nRing Goes the Bell<br />\nThe sight of Berry on stage<br />\nis magnetic. Dressed in pants<br />\nand shirt of tight, silky<br />\npurple, wearing patent<br />\nleather shoes and a fringed<br />\nvest, he looked as tough in<br />\n1970 as he had ten years<br />\nbefore. His face is weathered<br />\nand creased with deep lines<br />\nthat alter to reflect the<br />\nchanging moods of his music.<br />\nIn his two sets, there was<br />\nnothing new.

Only once or twice,<br />\ntoward the end of his second<br />\nset, did he engage in any<br />\nsophisticated guitarwork. His<br />\nenormous hands moved over<br />\nthe mother-of-pearl frets<br />\nsurely and methodically, with<br />\nno haste whatsoever.

The Mules will be fielding a team with<br />\n40 returning lettermen and could make<br />\nthings rough for the Jays.<br />\nThe question is very basic. It is simply a<br />\nmatter of whether or not the Jays have the<br />\nteam to get out on the field and win. At the<br />\nbeginning of every year a sportwriter can<br />\nget one of two answers out the average<br />\nfootball coach:<br />\n*\"This is a rebuilding year.\"<br />\n*\"This will be a great year.\"<br />\nWith Hopkins it<br />\nthe same<br />\nis<br />\nstory. The general feelings of Coach Sotir<br />\nare that while this may not be the best<br />\nteam we have ever had, it has to be one of<br />\nthe best spiritied. Gone are the days of the<br />\nJoe Cowan type one-man team. This team<br />\nhas to win on desire.<br />\nLast year the quarterback of the varsity<br />\nwas Bob Pfieffer. There were questions at<br />\ntimes as to whether or not Bob was<br />\ncapable of doing a good job.<br />\nThe answer seems \u2022 to be yes. The<br />\nteam did a fantastic job in the first<br />\nscrimmage against Lebanon Valley when<br />\nboth teams played<br />\nwithout lines or<br />\ntackling.<br />\nYet theteam's weakness came out when<br />\na full scrimmage was played in the after<br />\nnoon. It turns out that while in the<br /><br />\nThen, the quarterback spent a lot of<br />\ntime collecting grass stains on his back.<br />\nTeam Weakness<br />\nThe problem last year was basically<br />\nthat the Jays had no offensive line. This<br />\ncost the team a lot of ppints and when the<br />\noutstanding members of the offense<br />\nwere<br />\nwith injuries later<br />\nplagued<br />\nin the season it was understandable.<br />\nIf there is one thing Bob Pfieffer<br />\ndeserves credit for last year it was simply<br />\nhaving the guts to stay in the game. It was<br />\nunfortunate that he had to spend so much<br />\ntime on his back but the offensive line<br />\ndoomed him to that fate.<br />\nSo again this year we hear that the Jays<br />\nhave perhaps the best offensive backfield<br />\nin the league and should have no trouble<br />\nchurning out points. There are two first<br />\nrate quarterbacks in Pfieffer and Jim<br />\nPitts, good receivers in Dave Pickall, Tim<br />\nWeglicki, Bill\" Donovan, and Les Matthews, and good runners in Steve Hata,<br />\nDan Augustine, Joe Cieslowski, and Pat<br />\nNeary.<br />\nAgain the question is the offensive line<br />\nbecause no matter how good the offensive<br />\nbackfield is it needs a line to spring runners and to give the quarterbacks time<br />\nenough to pass. It means that there has to<br />\nbe someone<br />\nto<br />\nline<br />\nlead<br />\nthe<br />\nand this someone seems to be senior<br />\ncenter Gus Slotman.<br />\nIf Gus can give the line the leadership it<br />\nneeds it can make the difference between<br />\na mediocre season like last year and a true<br />\nchampionship.<br /><br />\n170<br /><br />\nPage 11<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nSeptember 25, 1970<br /><br />\nPrimary Races Still in Doubt;<br />\nMishaps Under Investigation<br />\nhoped there wouldn't be any.<br />\nThe count went on in an<br />\natmosphere of fear and<br />\nsuspicion.<br />\nCity police have been on an<br />\ninformal alert since last<br />\nTuesday's primary.
