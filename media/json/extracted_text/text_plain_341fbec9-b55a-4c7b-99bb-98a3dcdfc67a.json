However, this does not seem to be the<br />\ncase. Many students find that they receive more for their money in<br />\nother places, and hence refuse to patronize the local restaurant. The<br />\ncafeteria at Levering Hall is not supposed to make a profit. It is intended that enough be made to pay for the upkeep and a small rent.<br />\nOther cafeterias have an overhead which is higher than this rent and<br />\nupkeep, and must also make a profit. Something is wrong with the local<br />\ncafeteria. Either the management is poor or more money is being<br />\nmade than Y. M. C. A. originally planned.

The problem of a rush at twelve<br />\ntwenty was met and solved as well as possible. New situations constantly came up. By now the institution should be stabilized. The<br />\nperiod of experimentation should have come to an end. Definite<br />\nfigures as to how many people eat at each meal are at hand. It should<br />\nbe relatively easy to determine what profits will be and what prices<br />\nshould be charged.<br />\nWe hear the situation is being investigated and that an early<br />\nchange may be anticipated. If such a decrease does not soon take<br />\nplace, serious and just criticism will certainly result, and the cafeteria<br />\nmay expect a lean future.<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\n<br />\nOPERATE IT YOURSELF<br />\n<br />\nThe Auto Rental Company<br />\nCars for Hopkins Students<br />\nDeposit Not Required<br />\n2125 HARFORD AVE.<br />\n<br />\n111 W NORTH AVE.<br />\nPhone, Wolfe 1413<br />\n<br />\nHOmewood 8040-8041<br />\nYour clothes will always have that neat appearance if you will let us do your<br />\nCLEANING, DYEING, PRESSING AND REPAIRING<br />\n\"One Trial Will Convince You\"<br />\n<br />\nPARISIAN<br />\n<br />\nTAILORING<br />\n<br />\nCO.<br />\n<br />\nCorner University Parkway<br />\n<br />\n346 E. 33rd Street<br />\n<br />\nVISIT THE<br />\n<br />\nCASINO INDOOR GOLF COURSE<br />\nAmerica's Largest, Most Beautiful<br />\n<br />\n\"FORE\" E.

However, this does not seem to be the<br />\ncase. Many students find that they receive more for their money in<br />\nother places, and hence refuse to patronize the local restaurant. The<br />\ncafeteria at Levering Hall is not supposed to make a profit. It is intended that enough be made to pay for the upkeep and a small rent.<br />\nOther cafeterias have an overhead which is higher than this rent and<br />\nupkeep, and must also make a profit.

The problem of a rush at twelve<br />\ntwenty was met and solved as well as possible. New situations constantly came up. By now the institution should be stabilized. The<br />\nperiod of experimentation should have come to an end. Definite<br />\nfigures as to how many people eat at each meal are at hand. It should<br />\nbe relatively easy to determine what profits will be and what prices<br />\nshould be charged.<br />\nWe hear the situation is being investigated and that an early<br />\nchange may be anticipated. If such a decrease does not soon take<br />\nplace, serious and just criticism will certainly result, and the cafeteria<br />\nmay expect a lean future.<br /><br />\nThe<br /><br />\nOPERATE IT YOURSELF<br /><br />\nThe Auto Rental Company<br />\nCars for Hopkins Students<br />\nDeposit Not Required<br />\n2125 HARFORD AVE.<br /><br />\n111 W NORTH AVE.<br />\nPhone, Wolfe 1413<br /><br />\nHOmewood 8040-8041<br />\nYour clothes will always have that neat appearance if you will let us do your<br />\nCLEANING, DYEING, PRESSING AND REPAIRING<br />\n\"One Trial Will Convince You\"<br /><br />\nPARISIAN<br /><br />\nTAILORING<br /><br />\nCO.<br /><br />\nCorner University Parkway<br /><br />\n346 E. 33rd Street<br /><br />\nVISIT THE<br /><br />\nCASINO INDOOR GOLF COURSE<br />\nAmerica's Largest, Most Beautiful<br /><br />\n\"FORE\" E.
