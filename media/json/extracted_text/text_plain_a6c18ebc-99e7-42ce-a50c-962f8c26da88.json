XX, NO. 19.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MARCH 6, 1916.<br />\n<br />\nThe agitation for a course in<br />\nmilitary training, which has been<br />\ncarried on during the past six<br />\nmonths, now seems likely to be<br />\ncrowned with definite and immediate results. Dean Brush himself<br />\nhas announced that, in all .probability, Hopkins will have military<br />\ntraining within the year.<br />\nDuring the past week the Dean<br />\nhas appeared before such classes as<br />\n4nglish Literature I and Philosophy I, which contain most of the<br />\nstudents of the University, and has<br />\nput before the men the question as<br />\nto whether or not they were desirous of embarking upon the contemplated course this spring. Those<br />\nwho announced their readiness to<br />\ntake such a course have affixed their<br />\nsignatures to a statement to that<br />\neffect, and, in this manner, more<br />\nthan a hundred names have already<br />\nbeen received.<br />\nIt is felt by the Dean and others<br />\nof the faculty interested in military<br />\ntraining, that, if Hopkins is to have<br />\nsuch a course, it is advisable to install it as soon ag possible, and<br />\nthus to crystallize student sentiment, as well as to provide for the<br />\nsmooth working of the drills and<br />\nmaneuvers next year, when the<br />\nUniversity will be located at Homewood.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees has not<br />\nas yet taken official action upon the<br />\nquestion of the immediate installation of the course; it is as much to<br />\nshow them how many students are<br />\nwilling to go on record as ready to<br />\ndevote two or three afternoons a<br />\nweek to drilling, as for any other<br />\nreason, that the petitions have been<br />\ncirculated. It is confidently expected, however, that the trustees<br />\nwill approve the immediate establishment of the course.<br />\nThe only real difficulty which<br />\npresents itself is the obtaining the<br />\nconsent of the War College at<br />\nWashington. It was formerly nesessary for 15o students to affirm.<br />\ntheir readiness to enter into the<br />\nmovement before that department<br />\nwould enter upon arrangements to<br />\nprovide a course of military training at any college. Nevertheless,<br />\nthis is no hard and fast regulation,<br />\nand it is believed, that even if the<br />\nexpectations for the increasing of<br />\nthe present list are not realized,<br />\nthe college considering the circumstances, will furnish the instructors<br />\nand equipment necessary.<br />\nIf the course is established, it<br />\nwill, of course, be given at Homewood.

During the last week, petitions have<br />\nbeen circulated throughout the University requesting the Board of<br />\nTrustees to grant the use of the<br />\nMcCoy Hall for a talk by Mr. Sunday to the Hopkins students; and<br />\nthere seems to be every reason to<br />\nbelieve that the request will be<br />\ngranted.<br />\nThe sentiment of the students is<br />\napparently overwhelmingly in favor<br />\nof such a meeting and the great<br />\nmajority of them have affixed their<br />\nsignatures to a petition to the trustees for the use of McCoy Hall.<br />\nIf McCoy Hall cannot be secured,<br />\nhowever, it is quite likely that Mr.<br />\nSunday will speak in the chapel of<br />\nLevering Hall, although the latter<br />\nhall will not hold all those who<br />\nwould probably be present.<br />\nMr. Sunday, it is believed, would<br />\nreadily respond to a request to address the students of this University. He has spoken in many colleges in cities in which he has conducted revivals, and has always expressed himself as pleased with the<br />\nreception he has received.<br />\nThe chapel services this week<br />\nhave been led by members of the<br />\nSunday party, who have explained<br />\nthe motives and methods of action<br />\nof the evangelist.<br />\n<br />\nOn account of the examinations,<br />\nthe end of the big sales-check contest conducted by THE NEWS-LETTER, has been postponed from<br />\nMarch 8 to March 18. This will<br />\ngive the contestants an opportunity<br />\nto accumulate more receipts and<br />\nwill also give any new men who<br />\ndesire to enter the contest a chance<br />\nto do so.<br />\nThe one who passes into the<br />\nhands of the Business Managers of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER the highest<br />\namount of sales-checks and receipted bills of purchases from<br />\nNEWS-LETTER advertisers will receive first prize. As yet the prizes<br />\nhave not been announced, but it is<br />\nstated that they will be fine enough<br />\nto more than compensate the men<br />\nfor the trouble of collecting the<br />\nchecks. Every one who passes in<br />\n$15 worth of sales-checks will receive some kind of reward, theater<br />\ntickets, socks, ties, or the like.<br />\nThe real purpose of the contest,<br />\napart from the stimulation of interest in the student body, is to<br />\nshow THE NEWS-LETTER advertisers just how much business they<br />\nget from Hopkins' men and their<br />\nfamilies. If the Business Managers<br />\nof THE NEWS-LETTER can show<br />\nthat Hopkins', representatives have<br />\npurchased just so much from<br />\nNEWS-LETTER advertisers, it makes<br />\nthe getting of new ads easier and<br />\nthe holding of old ones certain.<br />\nThe contest closes at 12 o'clock<br />\non Saturday, March 18.

The Black and Blue<br />\nscored ten points winning firsts<br />\nthe high-jump and shot-put,<br />\nwhile Virginia won the trophy with<br />\neleven points. The coach had<br />\nplanned to concentrate the energies<br />\nof the team in a one-mile relay<br />\nwith Georgetown, and in the two<br />\nSouth Atlantic Championship<br />\nevents. On arriving on the scene<br />\nof action, however, the team was<br />\ninformed that, owing to some hitch<br />\n-in the management of the meet, the<br />\nGeorgetown four were unprepared<br />\nto run. Hopkins then distributed<br />\nits men as best she could, and<br />\nmanaged to make a fairly good<br />\nshowing.<br />\nThe most exciting event was the<br />\nSouth Atlantic 2-mile run. Weeks,<br />\nrunning for the first time in a 2mile event, put up a beautiful fight,<br />\nsetting the pace a large part of the<br />\nway and showing remarkably good<br />\njudgment. 1-le was beaten out in<br />\nthe last hundred yards by Campbell, of Georgetown, who covered<br />\nthe distance in 10 minutes and 10<br />\nseconds, which is unusually good<br />\ntime for the track.<br />\nIn the open quirter mile the Hopkins men were unable to overcome<br />\nthe heavy handicaps, but in the<br />\nSouth Atlantic Intercollegiate Association quarter, Uhler and Berkley, of Virginia, had an exciting<br />\nstruggle. Uhler got the start and<br />\nstuck to the rail relentlessly, in spite<br />\nof a great deal of crowding on the<br />\nsharp turns. In the last straightaway, Berkley bested him by a yard,<br />\nwhile Strauss was a close third.<br />\nStrauss, however, was given second<br />\nplace when the officials disqualified<br />\nUhler for crowding. The race was<br />\nof special interest, since only Hopkins and Virginia men took part.<br />\nIddings and Firor both did fine<br />\nwork in the field events, each surpassing his former 'mark. Firor<br />\nwas credited with 6 feet I inch, including his handicap, in the highjump. He shows promise of being<br />\na valuable man in this event in the<br />\nspring contests. Iddings also bested his old mark in the shot-put, and<br />\nwas credited with 46 feet, easily securing first place.<br />\nThis is the last meet of the indoor season and the squad will be<br />\n(Continued on 'page 10, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, MARCH 6, 1916.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!

Traveling<br />\nand other expenses incurred in connection with the examination must<br />\nbe paid by the candidates.<br />\nThe corps of Consular Assistants<br />\nconsists of forty men, who are assigned for duty in consular offices<br />\nby the Secretary of State.

Yet, despite the<br />\nfact that during the past week several men have come out to practice<br />\nwho did not attend the organization<br />\nmeeting, the authorities in charge<br />\nare availing themselves of all possible means to remind the freshmen<br />\nwho have any ability at all, and<br />\nmore especially those who signified<br />\ntheir intention .of becoming candidates at the meeting, of their duty<br />\nto the University and to themselves.<br />\nAmong the new men who came<br />\nout this week is the big Texan,<br />\nAubrey, who has previously covered the initial sack.

Mirza, a graduate<br />\nstudent of the Political Science Department of this University, has<br />\nwritten an article entitled \"The<br />\nKurds: Their Character and Customs,\" for the March number of<br />\nthe Review of Reviews.<br />\nThe Kurds are a nomadic tribe of<br />\nnorth Persia and many of their<br />\n\"Gutus\" or _warriors have joined<br />\nthe Turkish regiments in the present war. Since Mr. Mirza claims<br />\nPersia as a native land, he is able<br />\nto tell of this tribe as one who has<br />\nseen and associated with its members. The Kurds play the same<br />\npart in Persia as the gypsies do in<br />\nMr. Mirza's<br />\nNorth America.<br />\ngrandfather was a missionary<br />\namong these people and it is from<br />\nhim that he gained much of his<br />\nknowledge of their characteristics.<br />\nThe chief -reason for tlie Kurds<br />\nentering the war, says Mr. Mirza<br />\nin his article, was to get revenge<br />\nupon the Armenians, whom the<br />\nTurks were fighting. The. cause<br />\nof strife between them and the<br />\nArmenians is not one of religious<br />\nhatred as is commonly supposed,<br />\nbut simply one of economic jealousy. The Armenians are a thrifty,<br />\nindustrious and persevering race,<br />\nwhile the Kurds do no more work<br />\nthan is necessary, preferring to live<br />\nin peace and laziness rather than<br />\nto labor. The Armenians are better<br />\ndressed and live in better circumstances than their neighbors, who<br />\ndwell in goat-skin tents in summer<br />\nand in mud villages in winter.<br />\nMoreover, the Armenians live *by<br />\nworking in fields or factories; the<br />\nKurds, on the other hand, exist by<br />\nplundering and slaughtering.<br />\nNo people are more mistrusted<br />\nby the Persians and Turks, the article continues, than are the Kurds.<br />\nThese people do not consider a<br />\nman's religion or standing; they<br />\nwould rob a Turk as quickly as an<br />\nArmenian or a Greek. The only<br />\nlarge power which has any control<br />\nover them is Russia, which undertook their superveillance only after<br />\nthe Ottoman Porte and the Persian<br />\nShah had failed.<br />\nAmong the two and a half million people of this tribe there is no<br />\none who calls himself law-giver or<br />\nleader; no one who assumes the<br />\nauthority of punishing a fellow<br />\nKurd. Law with them is entirely<br />\na private matter; each individual<br />\nconsiders himself his own ruler.<br />\nThe Kurds love freedom and will<br />\nsubject themselves to no one. A<br />\nyoung man is judged by the amount<br />\nof successful robberies and murders<br />\nhe has committed and is often<br />\ncharged by his parents to gain<br />\nname and respect for himself and<br />\nhis family by this Method.<br />\nIn contrast to their rough ways<br />\nis their most distinguishing characteristic\u2014the great devotion<br />\namong the members of the families.<br />\n<br />\nThe circulation of the petition<br />\nfor funds for the erection of the<br />\nLayfield memorial, which was to<br />\nhave taken place throughout the<br />\nUniversity last week, has been unavoidably delayed. The petition,<br />\nhowever, will be put in the hands<br />\nof the student body sometime during this week.<br />\n\"Every student will be expected<br />\nto contribute something so that the<br />\nmemorial when erected will be<br />\ntruly representative of all Hopkins,\" said a member of the committee, when interviewed by a representative of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n\"Of course, the older men, who<br />\nknew Layfield personally, have,<br />\nperhaps, a greater interest in the<br />\nmatter, but we want the first-year<br />\nmen also to contribute to the fund.<br />\nThere will be no definite amount<br />\nstipulated, so that each can contribute according to his means and<br />\ninclination.

Morse of the Chemical Department of the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe circumstances connected with<br />\nthe awarding of this medal make<br />\nit a corfspicious honor to Professor<br />\nMorse, who has been at work for<br />\nmany years on the problem of<br />\nmeasuring the osmotic pressures of<br />\nsolutions. The success which has<br />\nattended his efforts in this field has<br />\nnow been recognized in a manner<br />\nwhich is most gratifying to the<br />\nfriends of Professor Morse and the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe award of the Avogadro<br />\nMedal came about in the following<br />\nway. In 1911 an international congress of scientists assembled at<br />\nTurin, Italy, to celebrate the centennial of the announcement of the<br />\nhypothesis of Avogadro. Those in<br />\nattendance decided to award a<br />\nmedal to be known as the Avogadro<br />\nMedal in honor of the founder of<br />\nthis hypothesis. This medal of<br />\n1,500 lires value, was to be awarded<br />\nto the investigator who should, in<br />\nthe judgment of the awarding committee, make the most valuable contribution to the subject of molecular physics during the years 1912,<br />\nThe award was<br />\n1913 and 1914.,<br />\nleft in the hands of the Turin Society, the \"Academia Delle Scienze<br />\nDi Torino,\" with the proviso that<br />\ndecision should not be made until<br />\nthe end of one year after the three<br />\nyear period mentioned above. The<br />\naward was made at a meeting of all<br />\nthe sections of the Academy on<br />\nFebruary 6, 1916.<br />\nThe molecular hypothesis of<br />\nAvogadro was proposed in 1811 to<br />\naccount for certain regularities exhibited by all gases when subjected<br />\nto the same conditions of temperature and pressure. It states that<br />\nunder these conditions equal volumes of all gases contain the same<br />\nnumber of ultimate parts\u2014i. c.<br />\nmolecules. This hypothesis ranks<br />\nwith the Atomic Theory, proposed<br />\nshortly before by the English physicist Dalton, as one of the most<br />\nfundamental laws of chemistry and<br />\nphysics.<br />\nThe same hypothesis as that of<br />\nAvogadro was proposed independently by the French physicist Ampere in 1815.<br />\nImmediately after the proposal<br />\nof the molecular hypothesis by<br />\nAvogadro, efforts were made by a<br />\nnumber of chemists to work out<br />\nwith its aid a reliable system of<br />\natomic weights. However, the failure of these investigators to distinguish between atoms and molecules led to great confusion and<br />\nultimately as a result the hypothesis<br />\n<br />\nEvery one who belongs to a family<br />\nwill adhere to the other members<br />\nthrough perils, dangers, slaughters<br />\nand punishments. An aged chief<br />\nis known to have given his life in<br />\nbehalf of a young warrior because<br />\nhe thought the latter would be of<br />\nmore use to the family in aiding<br />\nthem to feed the flocks and tend<br />\nthe goats.<br />\nThrough the Empires of Assyria<br />\nand Persia and Macedonia, Mr.<br />\nMirza concludes, through Parthian<br />\nAroacidae, and Iranian Sassanidae,<br />\nthrough the realms of the Arabian<br />\nKhalifs, the Turkish Sultans and<br />\nthe Persian Shahs, these Kurds<br />\nhave roamed as they are roaming<br />\nnow, over the slopes of the mountains, watering their flocks at the<br />\nsprings, pitching their goat-hair<br />\ntents in the recesses of the lonely<br />\nrocks, chanting their wild pathetic<br />\nairs with neither a past to remember, nor for which future to plan.<br />\nBefore College\u2014Life is just one<br />\n\u2014thing after another.<br />\nAfter College\u2014Life is a series of<br />\nvital phenomena\u2014Green Gander.<br />\n<br />\nof Avogadro fell into disrepute.<br />\nThis confusion was not cleared up<br />\nuntil some years later when the<br />\nItalian chemist Canizzaro called attention in a clear and emphatic<br />\nmanner to the difference between<br />\natoms and molecules and thereby<br />\ngreatly advanced \" the progress of<br />\nboth chemistry and physics.<br />\nThe beginning of the most modern era of chemistry dates from the<br />\ntime of the announcement of Van't<br />\nHoff's theory of'solutions. The<br />\nfundamentat idea of this theory is<br />\nthat .the molecules of a substance<br />\ndissolved in water exist in a condition which is similar to that of<br />\nthe molecules of a gas. It has been<br />\npointed out that Avogadro's conception of the molecular constitution of gases furnished the foundation for a rational explanation of<br />\nthe laws of gases. The application<br />\nby Van't Hoff, of this same conception to the condition of the<br />\nmolecules of a dissolved substance,'<br />\nhas done much the same for the<br />\nphenomena of solutions. According to this conception the molecules of both gases and dissblved substances are moving about in all directions at enormous velocities.<br />\nAlthough the weight of a single<br />\nmolecule is extremely small, their<br />\ngreat number and high velocity exercise a considerable force when<br />\ntheir motion is restrained. In the<br />\ncase of gases this kinetic energy of<br />\nthe molecules, when restrained by<br />\nthe walls of the containing vessel,<br />\nresults in a thrust or pressure<br />\nagainst the walls of the container.<br />\nIn the case of solutions this kinetic<br />\nenergy of the dissolved molecules<br />\nis exhibited as osmotic pressure<br />\nwhen the restraining wall is a substance which will permit water to<br />\nPass through it but will not permit<br />\nthe passage of molecules of the dissolved substance. Osmotic pressure<br />\nhas thus much the same relations to<br />\nsolutions that the pressure of gases<br />\nhas to gases.<br />\nAt the time Professor Morse began work on the difficult problem<br />\nof obtaining experimental evidence<br />\non these theories, there were only<br />\na few rough measurements of osmotic pressure on record, and the<br />\nneed for reliable measurements was<br />\ngreat. These have been obtained<br />\nwith marked success.<br />\nIt has been of vital importance<br />\nto the progress of this work that<br />\nit has been so generously assisted<br />\nby the Carnegie Institute of Washington. The liberality the Institution shows toward such work is<br />\na great incentive to those engaged<br />\nin scientific research in this country.<br />\n\"How can you expect to marry<br />\nmy daughter when you have no<br />\nmoney ?\"<br />\n\"How could you expect me to<br />\nmarry her if I did have ?\"\u2014Ex.<br />\nEnthusiast\u2014Don't the spectators<br />\ntire you with the questions \u2022 they<br />\nask?<br />\nAviator\u2014Yes.

Dean Brush himself<br />\nhas announced that, in all .probability, Hopkins will have military<br />\ntraining within the year.<br />\nDuring the past week the Dean<br />\nhas appeared before such classes as<br />\n4nglish Literature I and Philosophy I, which contain most of the<br />\nstudents of the University, and has<br />\nput before the men the question as<br />\nto whether or not they were desirous of embarking upon the contemplated course this spring. Those<br />\nwho announced their readiness to<br />\ntake such a course have affixed their<br />\nsignatures to a statement to that<br />\neffect, and, in this manner, more<br />\nthan a hundred names have already<br />\nbeen received.<br />\nIt is felt by the Dean and others<br />\nof the faculty interested in military<br />\ntraining, that, if Hopkins is to have<br />\nsuch a course, it is advisable to install it as soon ag possible, and<br />\nthus to crystallize student sentiment, as well as to provide for the<br />\nsmooth working of the drills and<br />\nmaneuvers next year, when the<br />\nUniversity will be located at Homewood.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees has not<br />\nas yet taken official action upon the<br />\nquestion of the immediate installation of the course; it is as much to<br />\nshow them how many students are<br />\nwilling to go on record as ready to<br />\ndevote two or three afternoons a<br />\nweek to drilling, as for any other<br />\nreason, that the petitions have been<br />\ncirculated. It is confidently expected, however, that the trustees<br />\nwill approve the immediate establishment of the course.<br />\nThe only real difficulty which<br />\npresents itself is the obtaining the<br />\nconsent of the War College at<br />\nWashington. It was formerly nesessary for 15o students to affirm.<br />\ntheir readiness to enter into the<br />\nmovement before that department<br />\nwould enter upon arrangements to<br />\nprovide a course of military training at any college. Nevertheless,<br />\nthis is no hard and fast regulation,<br />\nand it is believed, that even if the<br />\nexpectations for the increasing of<br />\nthe present list are not realized,<br />\nthe college considering the circumstances, will furnish the instructors<br />\nand equipment necessary.<br />\nIf the course is established, it<br />\nwill, of course, be given at Homewood.

During the last week, petitions have<br />\nbeen circulated throughout the University requesting the Board of<br />\nTrustees to grant the use of the<br />\nMcCoy Hall for a talk by Mr. Sunday to the Hopkins students; and<br />\nthere seems to be every reason to<br />\nbelieve that the request will be<br />\ngranted.<br />\nThe sentiment of the students is<br />\napparently overwhelmingly in favor<br />\nof such a meeting and the great<br />\nmajority of them have affixed their<br />\nsignatures to a petition to the trustees for the use of McCoy Hall.<br />\nIf McCoy Hall cannot be secured,<br />\nhowever, it is quite likely that Mr.<br />\nSunday will speak in the chapel of<br />\nLevering Hall, although the latter<br />\nhall will not hold all those who<br />\nwould probably be present.<br />\nMr. Sunday, it is believed, would<br />\nreadily respond to a request to address the students of this University. He has spoken in many colleges in cities in which he has conducted revivals, and has always expressed himself as pleased with the<br />\nreception he has received.<br />\nThe chapel services this week<br />\nhave been led by members of the<br />\nSunday party, who have explained<br />\nthe motives and methods of action<br />\nof the evangelist.<br /><br />\nOn account of the examinations,<br />\nthe end of the big sales-check contest conducted by THE NEWS-LETTER, has been postponed from<br />\nMarch 8 to March 18. This will<br />\ngive the contestants an opportunity<br />\nto accumulate more receipts and<br />\nwill also give any new men who<br />\ndesire to enter the contest a chance<br />\nto do so.<br />\nThe one who passes into the<br />\nhands of the Business Managers of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER the highest<br />\namount of sales-checks and receipted bills of purchases from<br />\nNEWS-LETTER advertisers will receive first prize. As yet the prizes<br />\nhave not been announced, but it is<br />\nstated that they will be fine enough<br />\nto more than compensate the men<br />\nfor the trouble of collecting the<br />\nchecks. Every one who passes in<br />\n$15 worth of sales-checks will receive some kind of reward, theater<br />\ntickets, socks, ties, or the like.<br />\nThe real purpose of the contest,<br />\napart from the stimulation of interest in the student body, is to<br />\nshow THE NEWS-LETTER advertisers just how much business they<br />\nget from Hopkins' men and their<br />\nfamilies. If the Business Managers<br />\nof THE NEWS-LETTER can show<br />\nthat Hopkins', representatives have<br />\npurchased just so much from<br />\nNEWS-LETTER advertisers, it makes<br />\nthe getting of new ads easier and<br />\nthe holding of old ones certain.<br />\nThe contest closes at 12 o'clock<br />\non Saturday, March 18.

The Black and Blue<br />\nscored ten points winning firsts<br />\nthe high-jump and shot-put,<br />\nwhile Virginia won the trophy with<br />\neleven points. The coach had<br />\nplanned to concentrate the energies<br />\nof the team in a one-mile relay<br />\nwith Georgetown, and in the two<br />\nSouth Atlantic Championship<br />\nevents. On arriving on the scene<br />\nof action, however, the team was<br />\ninformed that, owing to some hitch<br />\n-in the management of the meet, the<br />\nGeorgetown four were unprepared<br />\nto run. Hopkins then distributed<br />\nits men as best she could, and<br />\nmanaged to make a fairly good<br />\nshowing.<br />\nThe most exciting event was the<br />\nSouth Atlantic 2-mile run. Weeks,<br />\nrunning for the first time in a 2mile event, put up a beautiful fight,<br />\nsetting the pace a large part of the<br />\nway and showing remarkably good<br />\njudgment. 1-le was beaten out in<br />\nthe last hundred yards by Campbell, of Georgetown, who covered<br />\nthe distance in 10 minutes and 10<br />\nseconds, which is unusually good<br />\ntime for the track.<br />\nIn the open quirter mile the Hopkins men were unable to overcome<br />\nthe heavy handicaps, but in the<br />\nSouth Atlantic Intercollegiate Association quarter, Uhler and Berkley, of Virginia, had an exciting<br />\nstruggle. Uhler got the start and<br />\nstuck to the rail relentlessly, in spite<br />\nof a great deal of crowding on the<br />\nsharp turns. In the last straightaway, Berkley bested him by a yard,<br />\nwhile Strauss was a close third.<br />\nStrauss, however, was given second<br />\nplace when the officials disqualified<br />\nUhler for crowding.

Mirza, a graduate<br />\nstudent of the Political Science Department of this University, has<br />\nwritten an article entitled \"The<br />\nKurds: Their Character and Customs,\" for the March number of<br />\nthe Review of Reviews.<br />\nThe Kurds are a nomadic tribe of<br />\nnorth Persia and many of their<br />\n\"Gutus\" or _warriors have joined<br />\nthe Turkish regiments in the present war. Since Mr. Mirza claims<br />\nPersia as a native land, he is able<br />\nto tell of this tribe as one who has<br />\nseen and associated with its members. The Kurds play the same<br />\npart in Persia as the gypsies do in<br />\nMr. Mirza's<br />\nNorth America.<br />\ngrandfather was a missionary<br />\namong these people and it is from<br />\nhim that he gained much of his<br />\nknowledge of their characteristics.<br />\nThe chief -reason for tlie Kurds<br />\nentering the war, says Mr. Mirza<br />\nin his article, was to get revenge<br />\nupon the Armenians, whom the<br />\nTurks were fighting. The. cause<br />\nof strife between them and the<br />\nArmenians is not one of religious<br />\nhatred as is commonly supposed,<br />\nbut simply one of economic jealousy. The Armenians are a thrifty,<br />\nindustrious and persevering race,<br />\nwhile the Kurds do no more work<br />\nthan is necessary, preferring to live<br />\nin peace and laziness rather than<br />\nto labor. The Armenians are better<br />\ndressed and live in better circumstances than their neighbors, who<br />\ndwell in goat-skin tents in summer<br />\nand in mud villages in winter.<br />\nMoreover, the Armenians live *by<br />\nworking in fields or factories; the<br />\nKurds, on the other hand, exist by<br />\nplundering and slaughtering.<br />\nNo people are more mistrusted<br />\nby the Persians and Turks, the article continues, than are the Kurds.<br />\nThese people do not consider a<br />\nman's religion or standing; they<br />\nwould rob a Turk as quickly as an<br />\nArmenian or a Greek. The only<br />\nlarge power which has any control<br />\nover them is Russia, which undertook their superveillance only after<br />\nthe Ottoman Porte and the Persian<br />\nShah had failed.<br />\nAmong the two and a half million people of this tribe there is no<br />\none who calls himself law-giver or<br />\nleader; no one who assumes the<br />\nauthority of punishing a fellow<br />\nKurd. Law with them is entirely<br />\na private matter; each individual<br />\nconsiders himself his own ruler.<br />\nThe Kurds love freedom and will<br />\nsubject themselves to no one. A<br />\nyoung man is judged by the amount<br />\nof successful robberies and murders<br />\nhe has committed and is often<br />\ncharged by his parents to gain<br />\nname and respect for himself and<br />\nhis family by this Method.<br />\nIn contrast to their rough ways<br />\nis their most distinguishing characteristic\u2014the great devotion<br />\namong the members of the families.<br /><br />\nThe circulation of the petition<br />\nfor funds for the erection of the<br />\nLayfield memorial, which was to<br />\nhave taken place throughout the<br />\nUniversity last week, has been unavoidably delayed. The petition,<br />\nhowever, will be put in the hands<br />\nof the student body sometime during this week.<br />\n\"Every student will be expected<br />\nto contribute something so that the<br />\nmemorial when erected will be<br />\ntruly representative of all Hopkins,\" said a member of the committee, when interviewed by a representative of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n\"Of course, the older men, who<br />\nknew Layfield personally, have,<br />\nperhaps, a greater interest in the<br />\nmatter, but we want the first-year<br />\nmen also to contribute to the fund.<br />\nThere will be no definite amount<br />\nstipulated, so that each can contribute according to his means and<br />\ninclination. But, while there is naturally no obligation, every man<br />\nshould give something, so that a<br />\nmemorial worthy of the memory of<br />\nLayfield can be erected.\"<br />\nBeside the student contributions,<br />\nthe Athletic Association, the Young<br />\nMen's Christian Association, THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, and other organizations have announced that they will<br />\ncontribute to the fund.<br />\nPlans for the memorial have not<br />\nas yet been definitely formulated.<br />\nAs the petition states, however, it<br />\nhas been decided that the funds for<br />\nthe memorial should be obtained<br />\nwhile those who knew Layfield are<br />\nstill at Hopkins.

N. Morse of the Chemical Department of the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe circumstances connected with<br />\nthe awarding of this medal make<br />\nit a corfspicious honor to Professor<br />\nMorse, who has been at work for<br />\nmany years on the problem of<br />\nmeasuring the osmotic pressures of<br />\nsolutions. The success which has<br />\nattended his efforts in this field has<br />\nnow been recognized in a manner<br />\nwhich is most gratifying to the<br />\nfriends of Professor Morse and the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe award of the Avogadro<br />\nMedal came about in the following<br />\nway. In 1911 an international congress of scientists assembled at<br />\nTurin, Italy, to celebrate the centennial of the announcement of the<br />\nhypothesis of Avogadro. Those in<br />\nattendance decided to award a<br />\nmedal to be known as the Avogadro<br />\nMedal in honor of the founder of<br />\nthis hypothesis. This medal of<br />\n1,500 lires value, was to be awarded<br />\nto the investigator who should, in<br />\nthe judgment of the awarding committee, make the most valuable contribution to the subject of molecular physics during the years 1912,<br />\nThe award was<br />\n1913 and 1914.,<br />\nleft in the hands of the Turin Society, the \"Academia Delle Scienze<br />\nDi Torino,\" with the proviso that<br />\ndecision should not be made until<br />\nthe end of one year after the three<br />\nyear period mentioned above. The<br />\naward was made at a meeting of all<br />\nthe sections of the Academy on<br />\nFebruary 6, 1916.<br />\nThe molecular hypothesis of<br />\nAvogadro was proposed in 1811 to<br />\naccount for certain regularities exhibited by all gases when subjected<br />\nto the same conditions of temperature and pressure. It states that<br />\nunder these conditions equal volumes of all gases contain the same<br />\nnumber of ultimate parts\u2014i. c.<br />\nmolecules. This hypothesis ranks<br />\nwith the Atomic Theory, proposed<br />\nshortly before by the English physicist Dalton, as one of the most<br />\nfundamental laws of chemistry and<br />\nphysics.<br />\nThe same hypothesis as that of<br />\nAvogadro was proposed independently by the French physicist Ampere in 1815.<br />\nImmediately after the proposal<br />\nof the molecular hypothesis by<br />\nAvogadro, efforts were made by a<br />\nnumber of chemists to work out<br />\nwith its aid a reliable system of<br />\natomic weights. However, the failure of these investigators to distinguish between atoms and molecules led to great confusion and<br />\nultimately as a result the hypothesis<br /><br />\nEvery one who belongs to a family<br />\nwill adhere to the other members<br />\nthrough perils, dangers, slaughters<br />\nand punishments.

The<br />\nfundamentat idea of this theory is<br />\nthat .the molecules of a substance<br />\ndissolved in water exist in a condition which is similar to that of<br />\nthe molecules of a gas. It has been<br />\npointed out that Avogadro's conception of the molecular constitution of gases furnished the foundation for a rational explanation of<br />\nthe laws of gases. The application<br />\nby Van't Hoff, of this same conception to the condition of the<br />\nmolecules of a dissolved substance,'<br />\nhas done much the same for the<br />\nphenomena of solutions. According to this conception the molecules of both gases and dissblved substances are moving about in all directions at enormous velocities.<br />\nAlthough the weight of a single<br />\nmolecule is extremely small, their<br />\ngreat number and high velocity exercise a considerable force when<br />\ntheir motion is restrained. In the<br />\ncase of gases this kinetic energy of<br />\nthe molecules, when restrained by<br />\nthe walls of the containing vessel,<br />\nresults in a thrust or pressure<br />\nagainst the walls of the container.<br />\nIn the case of solutions this kinetic<br />\nenergy of the dissolved molecules<br />\nis exhibited as osmotic pressure<br />\nwhen the restraining wall is a substance which will permit water to<br />\nPass through it but will not permit<br />\nthe passage of molecules of the dissolved substance. Osmotic pressure<br />\nhas thus much the same relations to<br />\nsolutions that the pressure of gases<br />\nhas to gases.<br />\nAt the time Professor Morse began work on the difficult problem<br />\nof obtaining experimental evidence<br />\non these theories, there were only<br />\na few rough measurements of osmotic pressure on record, and the<br />\nneed for reliable measurements was<br />\ngreat. These have been obtained<br />\nwith marked success.<br />\nIt has been of vital importance<br />\nto the progress of this work that<br />\nit has been so generously assisted<br />\nby the Carnegie Institute of Washington. The liberality the Institution shows toward such work is<br />\na great incentive to those engaged<br />\nin scientific research in this country.<br />\n\"How can you expect to marry<br />\nmy daughter when you have no<br />\nmoney ?\"<br />\n\"How could you expect me to<br />\nmarry her if I did have ?\"\u2014Ex.<br />\nEnthusiast\u2014Don't the spectators<br />\ntire you with the questions \u2022 they<br />\nask?<br />\nAviator\u2014Yes.
