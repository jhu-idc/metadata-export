Yet their value is. questioned by ninety-nine<br />\nper cent of the freshmen in every university. In brief, for the benefit of those doubting yearlings, freshman regulations develop discipline, teach college tradition, make necessary class organization,<br />\npromote college allegiance, arouse ambition, and afford opportunity<br />\nfor many instances of mutual helpfulness.<br />\nIt is obvious, even to freshmen, that all the regulations are not<br />\nintended for disciplinary purposes or humiliation of the first year<br />\nmen. Regulation Number One is the one which affords opportunity<br />\nfor mutual helpfulness. On the one hand the freshman, being required to participate in some activity, serves his Alma Mater, while<br />\nin \"learning the ropes\" he is aided and guided by experienced upperclassmen. This rule, intended to equip the \"frosh\" for his part in the<br />\nlife of Johns Hopkins, has done much to put Hopkins activities on<br />\na sound footing. Through its enforcement much hidden ability and<br />\ntalent is uncovered. No doubt interesting statistics might be compiled from facts gathered from present college leaders showing the<br />\nrise of the majority during their four years in college.<br />\nWhile participation in activities is recognized as advantageous,<br />\nit is likewise clearly seen that over indulgence is disadvantageous<br />\nand in some cases even harmful. It should be remembered at all<br />\ntimes that pursuit of knowledge is the real reason for coming to college and not to engage solely in activities. The News-Letter, therefore, in its paternal capacity, would advise the freshman in colloquial<br />\nterms \"not to bite off more than he can chew.\"<br />\nOPPORTUNITY<br />\nA former editor of the News-Letter, on turning over the quill<br />\nto his successor, was heard to remark: \"I would not substitute the<br />\nexperience gained through my work in college journalism fOr any<br />\nthree courses offered in the curriculum.\" A statement of this kind<br />\nis proof of the value of News-Letter work. College newspaper work<br />\nis undoubtedly the broadest in scope of any activity, for in reporting<br />\nnews one is brought into contact with faculty members, university<br />\nofficials; campus leaders, and the entire student body.<br />\nIn . )ecoming a candidate for the News-Letter, a freshman is<br />\noffered tie opportunity of getting acquainted with college life. Aside<br />\nfrom the feeling of service to Johns Hopkins, there is a material<br />\n:reward offered. The Varsity Seal, a miniature reproduction in gold<br />\nof the University seal, is given for faithful and consistent work in<br />\nnon-athletic activities. The Seal corresponds to the Varsity \"H.\"<br />\nCandidates will be welcomed in the News-Letter Office today at<br />\n12:30.<br />\nThe News-Letter regrets to announce the resignation of Harold S.

Yet their value is. questioned by ninety-nine<br />\nper cent of the freshmen in every university. In brief, for the benefit of those doubting yearlings, freshman regulations develop discipline, teach college tradition, make necessary class organization,<br />\npromote college allegiance, arouse ambition, and afford opportunity<br />\nfor many instances of mutual helpfulness.<br />\nIt is obvious, even to freshmen, that all the regulations are not<br />\nintended for disciplinary purposes or humiliation of the first year<br />\nmen. Regulation Number One is the one which affords opportunity<br />\nfor mutual helpfulness. On the one hand the freshman, being required to participate in some activity, serves his Alma Mater, while<br />\nin \"learning the ropes\" he is aided and guided by experienced upperclassmen. This rule, intended to equip the \"frosh\" for his part in the<br />\nlife of Johns Hopkins, has done much to put Hopkins activities on<br />\na sound footing. Through its enforcement much hidden ability and<br />\ntalent is uncovered. No doubt interesting statistics might be compiled from facts gathered from present college leaders showing the<br />\nrise of the majority during their four years in college.<br />\nWhile participation in activities is recognized as advantageous,<br />\nit is likewise clearly seen that over indulgence is disadvantageous<br />\nand in some cases even harmful. It should be remembered at all<br />\ntimes that pursuit of knowledge is the real reason for coming to college and not to engage solely in activities. The News-Letter, therefore, in its paternal capacity, would advise the freshman in colloquial<br />\nterms \"not to bite off more than he can chew.\"<br />\nOPPORTUNITY<br />\nA former editor of the News-Letter, on turning over the quill<br />\nto his successor, was heard to remark: \"I would not substitute the<br />\nexperience gained through my work in college journalism fOr any<br />\nthree courses offered in the curriculum.\" A statement of this kind<br />\nis proof of the value of News-Letter work. College newspaper work<br />\nis undoubtedly the broadest in scope of any activity, for in reporting<br />\nnews one is brought into contact with faculty members, university<br />\nofficials; campus leaders, and the entire student body.<br />\nIn . )ecoming a candidate for the News-Letter, a freshman is<br />\noffered tie opportunity of getting acquainted with college life. Aside<br />\nfrom the feeling of service to Johns Hopkins, there is a material<br />\n:reward offered.

The<br />\nFrosh and Sophs both saw red,<br />\nthere was a plentiful besprinkling<br />\nof the red life fluid, proceeding<br />\nfrom the olfactory organs of<br />\nnumerous combatants, and topping<br />\nthe whole proceeding was the fiery<br />\nred head of one of the most pugnacious Freshmen that ever trod<br />\nthe paths of Homewood.<br />\nThis particular chap would persist in walking on the sacred lawns,<br />\nin spite of President Goodnow's<br />\n-straight line admonition,\" in spite<br />\nof certain well-known regulations,<br />\nand in spite of the objections of<br />\ncertain gentlemen known generically as the \"wise fools.\" And when<br />\nhe walked forward, his Freshmen<br />\ncompatriots saw red, both figuratively and literally, stepped in where<br />\nangels feared to tread (no insinuations meant), and were soundly<br />\npaddled for their pains by the aforementioned -wise-fool- Sophs.<br />\nIt was a great battle while it lasted. Rolling, scratching, yelling<br />\nmasses of humanity fought hard<br />\nand loyally for the honor of their<br />\nrespective classes. Standing on the<br />\n:fide-lines, Juniors, but a space removed from such squabbles, cheered<br />\nfor the Freshmen, urged the battles on, and laughed long and heartily; they knew that their own fighting days were o'er, hence no forebodings prevented their mirth from.<br />\nreaching its highest pitch. Seniors<br />\nyawned lazily, or smiled cynically,<br />\nin order to maintain their legened<br />\ndignity, although in reality they enjoyed the battle as much as any one<br />\nelse. Even certain dignified professors, long known for their unperturable tranquillity in the face<br />\nof all student pranks, were seen gingerly poking their heads forth from<br />\noffice windows, and as quickly withdrawing them. Their reputation<br />\nhad to be maintained. Yes, this<br />\nwas a real fight.<br />\nThe Frosh seemed to have the<br />\nedge. Out numbering the Sophs<br />\nalmost two to one, they showed<br />\ntheir valor in true Hopkins fashion.<br />\nBesides, did they not have the redheaded leader to make them see red;<br />\ndid not their respective countenances show red with blood, and<br />\nwasn't that tingling sensation induced by paddles a most reddening<br />\nmatter? The Sophs were up against<br />\ntoo much red, in this the first battle of the year. They tried to believe that it was green. green Frosh,<br />\nbut they either were color-blind, or<br />\ndetermined to avoid facts.
