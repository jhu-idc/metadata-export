Then<br />\nin recovering from a violent and<br />\nlengthy spasm of guffaws, from<br />\nwhich even a painfully slow execution did not much detract, one is<br />\nthoroughly inclined to agree with<br />\nthe judges, feeling however, that<br />\nthe Playshop did not make the best<br />\nof the opportunities in this hysterical satire.<br />\nPrimarily because it could not<br />\nkeep up the allegro tempo in which<br />\nthe play was written, and secondly<br />\nbecause the actors seemed too much<br />\nimpressed by the fact that they were<br />\na Napoleon, or a Juliette, to really<br />\nallow full play to the burlesque intended, the comedy of the second<br />\nact lost in quality.<br />\nIt made up for this, however, in<br />\ncleverness of line and action.<br />\nAnd Birds<br />\n<br />\nAll characters were by far at<br />\ntheir best in the last act where they<br />\nwere once more at home in an atmosphere of comic emotionalism.<br />\nMiss Lehr, whose voice was beautifully adapted to the part of a high<br />\nstrung mother who fears that her<br />\ndaughter has spent the night with<br />\nthe boy next door acquitted herself<br />\nadmirably, while Jeannette Sauters<br />\nas the innocent and naive sub-deb,<br />\nwas superb.

In<br />\nreality, she was only ensconced on<br />\nthe sofa downstairs, dreaming a<br />\nvery Freudian dream, in which her<br />\nfather is Napoleon; her mother Josephine ;. her friend and lover Chateaubriand ; and she Juliette, the<br />\nfairest mistress in France.
