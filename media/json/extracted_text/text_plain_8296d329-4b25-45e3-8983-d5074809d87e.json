Mary<br />\nEllen Porter, the head of the Panhellenic Council, described the<br />\nprocess by which Delta Gamma<br />\nwas chosen. According to Porter,<br />\nquestionaires were sent out to<br />\nsororities throughout the nation.<br />\nThose interested in establishing a<br />\nnew colony at Hopkins sent back<br />\nthe questionaires for the<br />\nPanhellenic Council to review.<br />\nPorter explained that the Council was looking for those<br />\nsororities which had established<br />\nthemselves on campuses similar<br />\nto Hopkins. Schools which were<br />\nresearch-orientated and highpressure with a high standard of<br />\nacademic excellence were<br />\nconsidered.<br />\nThe list of prospective<br />\nsororities was then narrowed<br />\ndown to three or four top choices,<br />\naccording to Porter. The selected<br />\nsororities came to Hopkins to<br />\nmake presentations on campus,<br />\nand Delta Gamma was selected.<br />\nPorter said that it might not be<br />\nnecessary to go through the entire 21;.ocess again. The<br />\nPanhellenic Council may review<br />\nother sororities who made presentations with Delta Gamma. If the<br />\nsororities still showed interest,<br />\nthey would be invited to make<br />\npresentations so that another<br />\nsorority could be chosen.<br />\nPorter said, however, that<br />\nnothing is definite at this time. A<br />\ngreat deal of organization lies<br />\nahead, she said, but most of the<br />\npeople involved feel it is<br />\nestablishing another sorority at<br />\nHopkins to satisfy the increased<br />\ninterest in Greek life.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nNon-Profit Criteria<br />\nTo Be Reviewed<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\nO'Shea added that the University's General Counsel office<br />\n\"does not believe that [the Fair<br />\nchairs] were under obligation to<br />\noffer Mr. Ryan a space, or that<br />\n[the chairs] violated any rules.\"<br />\nO'Shea also said that the General<br />\nCounsel had begun consulting<br />\nwith Quarles and Mansfield about<br />\nestablishing explicit criteria for<br />\nbooth applications in the future.<br />\nThough pleased with his<br />\ngroup's acceptance, Ryan still<br />\nbelieves that the action of the<br />\nchairs warrants further scrutiny.<br />\nIn a telephone interview, he<br />\nobserved that \"this is not the only time that men's concerns have<br />\ngotten rough treatment [at Johns<br />\nHopkins].\" He cited as evidence<br />\na recent decision to penalize Tau<br />\nEpsilon fraternity for a hostile en-<br />\n<br />\ncounter with a female, neighbor<br />\nand a recent University Conference on Student Health that he<br />\nfelt contained sexist undertones.<br />\nWhen grouped with the actions of<br />\nthe Fair chairs, Ryan said, the incidents suggest a pattern of \"evident sexism\" in several arms of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nAlthough Ryan said earlier that<br />\nhe had filed a civil discrimination<br />\nsuit with the Maryland Human<br />\nRelations Commision (MHRC)<br />\nagainst the University, he did not<br />\nmake it clear whether he would<br />\npursue the case.

Because of this,<br />\nI have been able to keep in close<br />\ntouch with the freshman class and<br />\nthe issues that concern us individually as well as collectively:<br />\nsmoking in campus buildings,<br />\nbringing existing and new school<br />\ntradition to the surface, stress<br />\n<br />\nmanagement, campus safety, and<br />\nbetter class unity. As class<br />\nsecretary, I will not only be<br />\nde-pendable for my organization<br />\nand promptness, but also for my<br />\nconcern, persistence, and<br />\nperspective. \u2022<br />\n<br />\nClaire Kelly<br />\nHi, I'm Claire Kelly and I am running for the position of class<br />\nsecretary. It is not important to me<br />\nfor you to know who I am and<br />\nwhat I've done; I'm more concerned with letting you know what<br />\nI want to do for our class. For<br />\nstarters, I think that we're all<br />\nanxious about losing contact with<br />\neach other and with the school. I'd<br />\nfeel responsible for coordinating<br />\nthe students' needs with administrative policy, as well as making sure that you know about<br />\nsignificant information and campus events. Every student's suggestion is important to me. Please<br />\nvote Claire Kelly for class<br />\nsecretary.<br />\n<br />\nZatar S. Khan<br />\nMy name is Zatar Khan and I'm<br />\nrunning for the office of secretary<br />\nfor the class of 1994. Having<br />\nserved as student council<br />\nsecretary in high school and as a<br />\nmember of the Board of Elections<br />\nhere this past year, I feel I have<br />\ngained considerable experience.<br />\nI am well schooled in the workings<br />\nof student council and feel it would<br />\nbe important to be a basis of communications, a liason if you will,<br />\nbetween our class officers and our<br />\nclass. By keeping the class wellinformed and up to date of the officers activities, we could better insure some positive feedback from<br />\n<br />\n'Go Ahead Pass the Word'<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Organization For Minority Engineers and Scientists, and<br />\nHopkins Indian Association. I feel<br />\nthat class representative is a very<br />\nimportant position which requires<br />\na person with leadership, responsibility, and commitment. Living on<br />\ncampus and my involvement with<br />\nvarious organizations has allowed<br />\nme to see the many problems<br />\nstudents face and the changes<br />\nthat are needed. If given the<br />\nchance, I will prove to you that I<br />\nam the person for the position.<br />\n<br />\nStephanie Lattin<br />\n<br />\nRoyce Poinsett<br />\n<br />\nThree. Three to represent 856.<br />\nDoesn't sound like many, does it?<br />\nThree individuals to represent the<br />\npersonalities and opinions of nearly 1000. While I cannot possibly<br />\nensure that my opinion and ideas<br />\nare the opinions and ideas of the<br />\nother of 855 of you, my actions will<br />\nearn your respect and confidence.<br />\nThree. Three more years left at<br />\nHopkins for the Class of 1994 to<br />\nmake its mark. We want life to be<br />\nFUN here at Hopkins (yes, it's<br />\npossible!!), and take advantage of<br />\nall Hopkins has to offer. Currently, I am involved in Hopkins<br />\nTutorial Project. Additionally, I am<br />\nconfident that my past experience<br />\nas Vice-President of Student<br />\nCouncil and President of a service<br />\nclub in high school have given me<br />\nthe ability to serve you well.<br />\nThree. Three times the amount<br />\nof people who usually vote. This<br />\nis what we should hope for in<br />\norder to establish legitimate elections. If you want good people to<br />\nrepresent YOU, than YOU must<br />\nvote!!<br />\nThree. Three more weeks of<br />\nschool left.

It<br />\nwill be even worse next year,<br />\nwhen we spread out all over this<br />\nbeautiful city. As a \"New Kid\"<br />\npledge to Delta Upsilon, I know<br />\nthat fraternity parties fill much of<br />\nthis social void, be we can have<br />\neven more quality entertainment<br />\nat JHU: speakers, bands you've<br />\nheard of, etc. All we need is<br />\nmotivated leadership and MORE<br />\nFUNDING.

He must be willing to<br />\nlisten to everyone's concerns, and<br />\nbe persuasive enough to have<br />\nthese concerns heard. Certainly,<br />\nI have some ideas about how to<br />\nimprove the general atmosphere<br />\nat JHU. But I can only promise a<br />\nvoice in government, one not<br />\nafraid to stir a little controversy if<br />\nit's necessary to get the job done.<br />\nAll other promises would likely be<br />\nempty and unfulfilled, just as<br />\nthey've been at every election in<br />\nhistory.<br />\nCurrently, I am the president of<br />\nmy fraternity pledge class and will<br />\ntake over as News-Letter sports<br />\neditor next fall. I believe that my<br />\ninvolvement with the News-Letter<br />\nwill prove useful, since there is no<br />\nbetter medium than a student<br />\npublication. Although I am pledging a fraternity, I strongly feel that<br />\nclass unity must exist in addition<br />\nto Greek life\u2014working together,<br />\nnot against each other. Finally, as<br />\na Writing Semiars major, I have<br />\nmore time than most (or so people say) to devote to Student<br />\nCouncil.

Freshman applications were up 17 percent from last year,<br />\nan increase made even more impressive at a time when many\u2014<br />\nincluding this publication\u2014feared that the University's public image was in decline. The new admissions figures suggest otherwise:<br />\nobviously a new group of some of the country's best students is more<br />\nthan willing to take its chances at Hopkins, and at a minimum of<br />\n$16,000 a year. Admissions has clearly done an excellent job of drawing a bevy of impressive applicants. Now the tricky part: Why is<br />\nit, as Director of Admissions Rit Fuller noted, that Johns Hopkins<br />\nis \"at the tail end with our peer institutions in terms of accepted<br />\nstudents who enroll\"?<br />\nOne obvious answer is that Hopkins lacks the prestige of Harvard<br />\nor Yale or Stanford, which is not exactly news. But if the University<br />\ncan't beat those schools at their own game\u2014name brand recognition<br />\nand word-of-mouth advertising\u2014it might try to make a name for itself<br />\nin some other categories.<br />\nCampus Diversity\u2014Kobi Little's observation on page 2 that<br />\nHopkins \"is not keeping pace with other universities of its caliber\"<br />\non issues of minority recruiting and cultural awareness may seem<br />\na tired issue, but it is undeniably correct. With all of the nascent<br />\nmovements to promote awareness and tolerance within the University community, only the Black Student Union has been a consistent<br />\nadvocate of more far-reaching recruiting efforts in the ongoing search<br />\nfor qualified freshmen. Admissions can point proudly to its large,<br />\nvaried Asian-American and foreign-student populations\u2014why not extend the diversity further, and include greater numbers of AfricanAmericans and Hispanics? This is easier said than done, the NewsLetter realizes, but diversity and tolerance are also easier to appreciate<br />\nin an environment that puts its minorities in the majority.<br />\nFaculty Members\u2014While the University continues to knock itself<br />\nout promoting its research-over-teaching ethic, discontent among<br />\nfaculty members continues to move in silently and ominously, like<br />\na fleet of enemy ships on the horizon. If President Richardson's incessant fundraising yields any fruit, it should go toward filling some<br />\nof the yawning holes in research and teaching-assistant funds\u2014just<br />\nto name two\u2014and as quickly as possible. Let no one in the administration think that a jump in applications means their work is finished,<br />\n<br />\nor even relieved. Great minds and great teachers are being lost\u2014<br />\nmost recently William Freehling of the Department of History, who<br />\ntook a position at another school because Hopkins, he said, is \"a<br />\nresearch institution that doesn't give its faculty members what they<br />\nneed to do research and teach responsibly.\" For those who didn't<br />\nknow Dr. Freehling, imagine the loss of David Olton in Psychology,<br />\nRichard Macksey in the Humanities Center, or Steven David in<br />\nPolitical Science, and the void left by Freehling\u2014especially in<br />\nteaching\u2014is easier to appreciate. The University will have trouble<br />\nenough trying to replace one such talent. It ought to bend over<br />\nbackwards to ensure that it doesn't lose another.<br />\nCommunity\u2014Before Admissions sends out another of its elegantly<br />\nproduced brochures to prospective students, it might consider asking the administration to loosen up the pursestrings for a new student union and a greater HOP budget, to name only two pressing<br />\nneeds. More students at Hopkins take it for granted that their peers<br />\nare a little cold; that yeah, a lot are just plain jerks; and that they<br />\ndon't often get a chance to meet people. It doesn't have to be so dire.<br />\nThe News-Letter believes that a campus spot for after-hours dancing<br />\nand (yes, we'll say it) drinking would do wonders for the atmosphere<br />\nhere at Hopkins. It may not be priority\u2014student concerns never are\u2014<br />\nbut administrators looking for a more cohesive, active student community could hardly spend their money in a better way. And it will<br />\npay off in spades when prospectives come and actually find the people having fun.<br />\nDisconnected as these three phenomena might seem; they all directly<br />\naffect the atmosphere at\u2014and eventually the public image of\u2014the<br />\nUniversity. A diverse student population sets a good example for<br />\nother schools and suggests that Hopkins' commitment to providing<br />\nquality education is more than skin- or checkbook-deep. Support for<br />\nfaculty members encourages better teaching, which yields bettereducated students, which yields a better image for the University.<br />\nAnd a more tightly knit student community would benefit everyone<br />\nfrom Admissions to Zeniada.<br />\nSmall improvements? Perhaps. But if a better Johns Hopkins is<br />\nthe goal\u2014and we optimistically hope it is\u2014we should shoot for standards that have more resonance than SAT scores, and more depth<br />\nthan an Ivy League reputation. If that won't attract talented incoming freshmen, then perhaps we don't want 'em.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe headline story of the March<br />\n29th issue (GALA Launches First<br />\nAwareness Week)about the gay and<br />\nlesbian groups on the Hopkins campus aroused our interest. In time,<br />\neach member of the JHU community should be involved in the erection<br />\nof the affair exposing jtie,uniqueness<br />\nof his or her intercourse. Such<br />\nstimulating displays should be encouraged; they are the climax of<br />\nmany swell lifestyles.

Surely this would<br />\nhave helped to make Johns Hopkins<br />\nmore of the tolerant, diverse and interesting university that we would<br />\nlike it to be.

Thus chlorine<br />\natoms offset the equilibrium<br />\ntowards normal oxygen atoms,<br />\nand the UV wavelengths normally absorbed by ozone reach the<br />\nsurface of the earth where unsuspecting sun bathers soak them<br />\nup.<br />\nThree years ago, an international study during winters from<br />\n1976-1986 found a decrease of 3<br />\npercent in the ozone layer at<br />\nlatitudes above 40 degrees north<br />\nand only 1.7 percent at more<br />\nsouthern latitudes. This NASA<br />\nstudy has found that the ozone<br />\ndepletion is almost 8 percent in<br />\nthe northern latitudes and 6 percent in the more southern<br />\nlatitudes. Since it is believed that<br />\n<br />\nwarm weather slows done the<br />\nchemical reactions which deplete<br />\nthe ozone, no readings are taken<br />\nin the summer. In the new NASA<br />\nstudy, scientists recorded<br />\ndecreases in ozone levels in April<br />\nand May of6 percent and 4 percent in the northern and southern<br />\nregions respectively. This is<br />\nespecially serious since so many<br />\npeople are outdoors in these<br />\n<br />\nA closer look at the<br />\nozone layer\u2014or at least<br />\nwhat's left of it<br />\n<br />\nmonths and are less protected by<br />\nclothing than in winter. According to the EPA,for every percentage point of ozone depletion, the<br />\nnumber of skin cancer cases will<br />\nrise by 5 percent.<br />\nUV-B is extremely dangerous.<br />\nIn addition to that deep copper tan<br />\nsported at beaches, it causes<br />\nwrinkled and leathered skin, skin<br />\ncancers such as melanoma, a fatal<br />\n<br />\nform of skin cancer which causes<br />\n8,000 deaths annually, and eye<br />\ndisorders, such as cataracts,<br />\nwhich can result in blindness if<br />\nnot treated quickly. Some scientists are now finding that UV-B<br />\ndepresses the human immune<br />\nsystem, leaving us more susceptible to disease.<br />\nThe damage to the biosphere<br />\nmay be even more serious. More<br />\nthan 70 percent of our crops are<br />\nsensitive to UV-B. It decreases<br />\nphotosynthesis, water-use efficiency, yield, and leaf area,<br />\nwhich further weakens photosynthesis. At the University of<br />\nMaryland, a study found that soybeans, an important crop are<br />\nespecially sensitive. An ozone<br />\nloss of 25 percent could decrease<br />\nthe yield of soybeans by as much<br />\nas 25 percent.<br />\nPhytoplanktons, the base of the<br />\nfood chain, require sunlight to<br />\ngrow, and thus will be unable to<br />\nescape the UV radiation. A 25<br />\npercent loss of ozone could<br />\ndecrease the phytoplankton yield<br />\nby as much as 35 percent.

This was going to be a long<br />\none of those talks. \"Well, when<br />\na person sees another person, and<br />\nthat person thinks that other person is really nice, and that person likes the other person very<br />\nmuch, and that person wants to<br />\nget really close to the other person, that's attraction. If you're attracted to someone, you should be<br />\nvery careful to check them for<br />\nweird diseases or lizards. If you'd<br />\nlike, I'll\u2014\"<br />\n\"No, no,\" she said. \"I mean<br />\nattraction, you know, like attractors and repellors. Do you know<br />\nabout chaos?\"<br />\n\"If I knew about chaos, I<br />\nwouldn't be quite so intimately<br />\nfamiliar with it.\"<br />\nShe clicked her nostrils impatiently. I mistook her irritation for<br />\naffectionate sympathy and offered<br />\nher a stick of gum, but she ignored my antics. Chaos theory,<br />\nshe explained, stated that apparently chaotic phenomena, like<br />\nthe weather, actually followed<br />\nsome hidden pattern. Halfway<br />\nthrough the conversation, she<br />\npulled out a colorful book that<br />\nsaid something about \"Chaos\"<br />\non the front, and smacked its<br />\ncover every time she said the<br />\nword \"chaos.\" Soon, she started<br />\n<br />\nPer Jambeck<br />\n<br />\nEnough<br />\ncalling out the word \"chaos\" in<br />\nthe same way that people announced that they had won the<br />\nBlack Death sweepstakes during<br />\nthe Middle Ages.

I smiled politely while the<br />\nbeast urinated on my head, then<br />\nexcused myself.<br />\nEvery so often, a science<br />\nbecomes popular. Not long ago,<br />\nit was biotechnology. Before that,<br />\nit was particle physics. Cellular<br />\nautomata were pretty hip for a<br />\nwhile, and there was a time when<br />\nsimply everyone was talking<br />\nabout artificial intelligence. I<br />\ndon't know who determines what<br />\nis worth studying, but I used to<br />\ntry to keep tabs on what was \"in\"<br />\nby going to bookstores and looking for the big, colorful, and<br />\nscience-related covers in the<br />\nbestseller section.<br />\nManny, the guy at the<br />\nbookshop, always used to tell me,<br />\n\"You know, I used to be a<br />\nfamous physicist.

It was just another trip<br />\nto the bookstore for me, but<br />\neverything had changed for the<br />\nformer physicist. That night, he<br />\nprematurely opened a package of<br />\nbooks and read all about the coming miracle of cybernetics. Suddenly, Manny found himself invited to all the good cocktail parties just so he could show off his<br />\nfashionable knowledge of cuttingedge science. Soon, he was addicted, tearing through cognitive<br />\nscience books and astronomy<br />\ntexts several months in advance,<br />\nusing the best facts for party<br />\ngossip, and then selling the dregs<br />\nto wealthy doctoral students and<br />\ngrant writers.<br />\nIn the meantime, the bookshop<br />\nfell into ruin.

Four of these courses are given<br />\nentirely in English, require no knowledge of a foreign language, and have no prerequisites:<br />\n<br />\n130.101 (H) Ancient Near Eastern Civilizations (3), MW 10 Schwartz<br />\nAn introduction to the entire ancient Near East, from the first prehistoric farming communities to Alexander the Great. Learn about<br />\nthe first cities and the first empires known. Includes the Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites, Hurrians, Israelites, Egyptians,<br />\nPhoenicians, and Persians. If you want to understand the roots of conflict in the Middle East, this is the place to start!<br />\n<br />\n130.301 (H) History of Ancient Syria-Palestine, including Israel (3), M 3-5 McCarter<br />\nFocuses on the area of modern Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan. Discover the great early civilizations of Syria, including the revolutionary<br />\nfinds from Ebla. Learn how our own alphabet originated in the second millennium BC. Study the emergence of ancient Israel and its interaction<br />\nwith its neighbors. Evaluate the Old Testament as a historical source. In this course, you will do it all!<br />\n<br />\n130.305 (H) Law in the Ancient World (3), TTh 3 Westbrook<br />\nOur modern concepts of law and justice can be traced directly back to the ancient world. This course will survey the legal systems of the ancient<br />\nNear East and early Greece and Rome from the earliest known records through the fifth century BC. Reading assignments will focus on original<br />\ndocuments, like the Code of Hammurabi, in English translation. Taught by a lawyer, the course will compare the legal concepts of the world's<br />\noldest known systems with those of modern law.<br />\n<br />\n130.391 (H) Jewish Literature and Civilization (2), W 11-12:30 Smolar<br />\nStudy Jewish literature in translation from early post-biblical times to the present as a mirror of religious and social development, political<br />\ntheory, and philosophical diversity. Taught by the president of the Baltimore Hebrew University.<br />\nIf you like learning new languages, and have been intrigued by Egyptian hieroglyphs or the wedge-shaped cuneiform signs on Babylonian clay<br />\ntablets, you might want to try the following courses. Although they have graduate numbers, undergraduates who apply themselves should have<br />\nno difficulty completing them successfully.<br />\n<br />\n132.600 (H) Elementary Akkadian (4), TBA Westbrook<br />\nThe language of ancient Babylonia and Assyria, written in cuneiform script. After an introduction to the script and grammar, beginners are<br />\nsoon reading texts that form the basis of Western culture, such as the Flood story and the first great law code.<br />\n<br />\n133.600 (H) Hieroglyphs: Script and Language of Ancient Egypt (4), TBA Galan<br />\nAn introduction to Middle Egyptian, the classical language of Egyptian hieroglyphs. The same language that was written by King Tut and<br />\nRamses the Great, it is taught at only a handful of universities. A year will make you conversant enough to read some short stories, a few of the<br />\nworld's first medical texts, and inscriptions from statues in museums (amaze your friends!).<br />\nYou may think you know Hebrew, but until you've studied the language of the Bible on its own terms, you only know part of the story. The<br />\nfollowing course will introduce you to the Hebrew of the Bible, unencumbered by post-biblical accretions:<br />\n<br />\n130.440 Elementary Biblical Hebrew (3), TBA Scott<br />\nNote: Courses marked TBA will be scheduled to suit the convenience of the interested students.

I literally collapsed on my<br />\nsleeping bag in the gym. No surprise, Jodie had arrived a full<br />\nhour earlier. While waiting for<br />\nJodie's mom to save us from gym<br />\n<br />\nshowers, cafeteria food, and stifling heat, I alternated between<br />\nsleep, Genesis, and R.E.M.<br />\nAt Jodie's house I caught an interesting CAM story on the 5:00<br />\nnews. The reporter, standing on<br />\nthe campus of Howard Community College at 5:30 PM, informed viewers that \"as we<br />\nspeak, they're on their way from<br />\nColumbia to Upper Marlboro.\"<br />\nWell, she was only about 14<br />\nhours early.<br />\n<br />\nwere told to stop and walk our<br />\nbikes across the very busy Route<br />\n30.

After only the first<br />\nhour I was soaked through. The<br />\nrain and wind also made for a<br />\nparticularly chilly ride, and even<br />\nwith my windbreaker I shivered<br />\non the slight and brief downhills.<br />\nThe route passed through the<br />\nback roads behind NASA in<br />\nGreenbelt, but I was too<br />\nmiserable to be interested. The<br />\nrain was so horrible I began<br />\ndrinking the water dripping off of<br />\nmy helmet and face, more the<br />\nconsequence of an open mouth<br />\nthan a matter of choice. Even<br />\nwith my head down, water found<br />\nits way into my contacts.

And I waited. And<br />\nwaited. I began to suspect that not<br />\none of the nurses knew exactly<br />\nwhere Jodie was, or that if they<br />\ndid, they weren't going to let me<br />\nsee her.

The second, which<br />\nNichols summarized as \"the<br />\nhuman body as food processor,\"<br />\ndwelt on the role of food as the<br />\nroot of conflict.<br />\nDoueihi also contributed a<br />\npresentation on the works of<br />\nFrancois de Sases, a seventeenthcentury French writer. De Sases<br />\nwrote two books which used food<br />\nmetaphors to discuss difficult or<br />\nsensitive concepts. Introduction<br />\nto Devout Life described<br />\nreligious meditation in terms of<br />\nthe processes of eating and chewing. The second text, Treaties of<br />\nDivine Love,combined banquets,<br />\nbutterflies, and elephants in an<br />\nexplanation of marital and sexual<br />\netiquette for young women. The<br />\nbooks were so popular that they<br />\nwent through forty editions in ten<br />\nyears, many of which were<br />\nbootlegged without de Sases'<br />\n<br />\nJodie. She was alright.

Gebelein's enthusiasm helped to create a<br />\ndynamic student group that<br />\npushed the lacrosse team to victory after victory with their<br />\nmusic. The Band began as an<br />\noutlet for students wanting to play<br />\ninstrumental music and it<br />\nevolved into a pep band for<br />\nlacrosse and a banjo club that<br />\nbecame extinct after World War<br />\nGebelein affectionately known<br />\nas \"Gebby,\" was given the honor<br />\nof having the Stadium named<br />\nafter him in 1967. He retired in<br />\n1971 and the current director,<br />\nLarry Springer, continues the<br />\ntradition of Gebby's enthusiasm.<br />\nAccording to Mike Dante,<br />\npresident of the Band, this student<br />\ngroup is full of hard-working,<br />\ndedicated people who are nevertheless a lot of fun and enjoy<br />\nplaying music.

No disposable cup<br />\ncan prove itself ecologically<br />\nsound when compared to reusable<br />\nchina. It's unrealistic, however,<br />\nto suggest that disposables be<br />\neliminated; given such a situation, paper products are<br />\npreferable to those of<br />\npolystyrene.<br />\nFrom the beginning, polystyrene presents environmental<br />\nproblems that are more serious<br />\nthan those presented by producing paper. The most serious of<br />\nthese is the use of pentane,<br />\nstyrene, and benzene. Pentane is<br />\nnow used as a blowing agent instead of the ozone-depleting<br />\nchlorofluorocarbons. While pentane does little or no damage to<br />\nthe ozone in the stratosphere, it<br />\ncreates ozone at ground level.<br />\nOzone at this level is a contributor<br />\n<br />\nto smog and has been proven to<br />\ncause lung damage and immune<br />\nsystem problems. Pentane is also<br />\nhighly explosive and creates job<br />\nhazards in the factories. Other job<br />\nhazards associated with the production of polystyrene include<br />\nskin diseases, cancer, lung problems, and kidney diseases. Of<br />\nchemicals produced in the United<br />\nStates, polystyrene production<br />\ncreates the fifth largest amount of<br />\nhazardous waste.<br />\nThere are problems with producing paper cups. First is the<br />\nresources required. While wood<br />\nis a renewable resource, current<br />\nlogging practices are exceedingly poor. Clearcutting is a problem<br />\nwith all wood-related products.<br />\nStill, sustainable logging practices<br />\ndo exist, which, if more widely<br />\nused, would allow the harvesting<br />\nof trees without undue damage to<br />\nthe environment. The other problem is that paper production is<br />\ninefficient. One answer is to use<br />\nrecycled paper.

It is also<br />\ntrue that while there is technology<br />\nto recycle polystyrene, it is<br />\nneither available nor environmentally sound. Recycling polystyrene releases, once again, pentane, benzene, and styrene. Much<br />\nof Baltimore's waste is currently<br />\nincinerated, not recycled, including most of the polystyrene<br />\nand paper cups used. Incinerating<br />\npaper produces methane and carbon dioxide; the EPA says that<br />\nincinerating polystyrene produces<br />\n57 toxic chemicals.<br />\nPaper might not always decompose in landfills, but polystyrene<br />\nnever decomposes anywhere.<br />\n<br />\nPolystyrene that finds its way into<br />\nthe oceans is often mistaken by<br />\nanimals for food and ingested a<br />\npainful death. Almost 25 percent<br />\nof all floating debris in the ocean<br />\nis polystyrene. Polystyrene that<br />\nends up in landfills can leach<br />\nstyrene, benzene, and pentane<br />\ninto nearby water supplies. The<br />\nmethane and carbon dioxide produced by paper would be produced by the wood left to rot on<br />\nthe forest floor. Any decomposing natural substance produces<br />\nmethane and carbon dioxide.<br />\nPolystyrene doesn't have this probecause it never<br />\nblem<br />\ndecomposes.<br />\nEven if paper and polystyrene<br />\nwere equal in all environmental<br />\nrespects, there is a critical difference between them. Drinking<br />\nhot liquids from polystyrene cups<br />\nis dangerous to your health. Some<br />\nof the styrene dissolves into the<br />\nliquid and may be ingested in the<br />\ndrink it has been in contact with.<br />\nStyrene is a carcinogen. In 1986,<br />\nan EPA study found styrene in the<br />\nfat tissues of 100 percent of<br />\n<br />\ngin!<br />\n<br />\nElliott Chen<br />\n<br />\nPresident Emily Smith and Vice President Dave Redish of SEA<br />\nencourage the use of paper products over polystyrene foam.<br />\nAmerican adults studied. Since<br />\nstyrene is not a naturally occurring substance, they concluded<br />\nthat the source of this styrene was<br />\npolystyrene cups.<br />\nThe real answer is not to use<br />\ndisposable cups at all. Both paper<br />\nand polystyrene cups present environmental problems. Because<br />\nthey are reused many times, nondisposable cups, such as glass or<br />\nchina, present a small fraction of<br />\nthe problems of disposables on a<br />\nper use basis. Many places that<br />\noffer disposable cups will not ob-<br />\n<br />\nject if you bring your own mug.<br />\nSome places even give a discount<br />\nif you do. Arguing the relative<br />\nmerits of paper or polystyrene<br />\nobscures the fact that neither is a<br />\nviable option compared to<br />\nreusable cups; the debate raises<br />\na complex issue with a simple<br />\nanswer. Rather than spending our<br />\ntime searching for ways to make<br />\ndisposables a little less offensive,<br />\nwe should be focusing on ways<br />\nto phase out the use of disposables<br />\naltogether.<br />\n<br />\nThe first<br />\nLaserWriter thatfits<br />\nin your wallet.<br />\n<br />\nVek;<br />\n<br />\nThe New York Times<br />\nbestseller\u2014at last<br />\na Bantam paperback.<br />\nBANTAM<br />\n<br />\nSUMMER SESSIONS<br />\n1991<br />\n<br />\neorgetown<br />\nUNIVERSITY<br />\n\u2022 SchoolforSummer and<br />\nContinuing Education<br />\nPlease send more information on:<br />\nPrograms at Geolgetoren<br />\n_Over 200 graduate and<br />\nundergraduate courses<br />\n_ Public Affairs Internships<br />\n_ I I igh School Programs<br />\n_ Intercultural Training<br />\n_ Interpretation and<br />\nTranslation Institute<br />\n_ Language Courses<br />\n_ Theology Conference<br />\n_ Literary Criticism(:onference<br />\n_ Institute for I I.S.'Teachers<br />\n_ Institute on Socred Scripture<br />\n_ Alumni(Alege<br />\n_ English as a Fireign<br />\n.anguage<br />\n_ I lelping Families Cope;<br />\nEthical and Pastoral Care<br />\nIssues in Genetics<br />\n<br />\nPrograms abroad<br />\n_ Antwerp, Belgium\u2014Intl.

The top two teams in<br />\nDivision I lacrosse squared off in<br />\na battle for national bragging<br />\nrights. Unfortunately for the Blue<br />\nJays, the top-ranked Tar Heels of<br />\nthe University of North Carolina<br />\ncan brag\u2014for now. The Tar<br />\nHeels defeated Hopkins 11-6<br />\nbeneath a Carolina blue sky to remain undefeated and top ranked.<br />\nIn a game that was closer than the<br />\nscore indicated, Carolina (7-0)<br />\nused a third-quarter surge to pull<br />\nahead of the Jays 8-4 in front of<br />\n5700 fans at Fetzer Field. At least<br />\nthe Blue Jays finished the<br />\ntoughest stretch of their schedule<br />\n(Syracuse in the Carrier Dome,<br />\nthen No. 1 UVa, and at NO. 1<br />\nUNC)with two victories. That's<br />\ntwo more than the experts<br />\npredicted before the season<br />\nstarted as all three teams were<br />\nranked above Hopkins. At 4-2 on<br />\nthe year the Jays are now the<br />\nfourth ranked team, behind<br />\nCarolina, Princeton, and Brown.<br />\nHopkins jumped out to a 2-0<br />\nlead 4 minutes and 38 seconds into the game on goals 29 seconds<br />\n<br />\napart. Junior Jeff Wills opened<br />\nthe scoring off a cross field feed<br />\nfrom Matt Panetta. After the goal<br />\nCarolina was called for unnecessary roughness and the Jays<br />\nscored on the ensuing extra-man<br />\nopportunity. Panetta, at the top of<br />\nthe restraining box, found Seth<br />\nTierney, playing with a broken<br />\nwrist for the second week, in<br />\nfront of the cage where he released a five-yard shot over UNC<br />\ngoalie Andy Piazza's shoulder.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense looked like<br />\nit was about to continue where it<br />\nleft off after last week's Virginia<br />\nvictory but that was not to be.<br />\nPlaying on their home grass<br />\nfield (beautifully manicured to<br />\nlook like a golf fairway), the Tar<br />\nHeels used their deep bench and<br />\noverall team speed to control the<br />\ntempo of the game until the final<br />\nbuzzer. After tying the game two<br />\nminutes later on goals 18 seconds<br />\napart, UNC began dictating play.<br />\nAlthough the Heels did do a good<br />\njob of keeping Hopkins in the<br />\ngame thoughout the first half by<br />\nfailing to convert several fast<br />\nbreak opportunities and missing<br />\nthe 6x6 on still more, they seemed to be slowly taking control of<br />\nthe game. The final statistics<br />\nwould suggest the same; the Jays<br />\nwere outshot 51-35 for the after-<br />\n<br />\nnoon. Of those, Hopkins put 23<br />\non net compared to Carolina's 31.<br />\nGiven the chance, Hopkins<br />\ntook the lead back at 3-2 on an<br />\nincredibly no-angle shot by Brendan Cody. The play was a great<br />\nindividual effort but it marked the<br />\nbeginning of the end. Without the<br />\ncutting and the movement from<br />\nthe other players on the offensive<br />\nend the Jays were bound to get into trouble. But while Hopkins<br />\nlooked to get back in the swing<br />\nthey were missing their own<br />\nchances, too. Hopkins hit the pipe<br />\non at least three occasions in the<br />\nfirst half. Any one of those could<br />\nhave been a goal, and an important one, but the bounces were not<br />\ngoing the Blue Jay way.<br />\nAs both teams did their best to<br />\nkeep the game close, Carolina<br />\nstarted to crank up a talented offense led by Michael Thomas and<br />\nJohn Webster. With the transition<br />\ngame getting into gear, Carolina<br />\nwas getting into what they do<br />\nbest. \"They live and die by controlling the tempo,\" noted Blue<br />\nJay coach Tony Seaman. And that<br />\nis exactly what happened. Both<br />\nThomas and Webster recorded<br />\nthree goals and one assist on the<br />\nday. Meanwhile, Brian Voelker<br />\nand Scott Giardina did their best<br />\nto keep the Jays in the fight.<br />\n<br />\nWorld Champion Reds Have Fair<br />\nChance to Win Division Again<br />\nby Ethan Skolnick<br />\nBefore capturing last year's<br />\nNational League West crown,<br />\nthe Cincinnati Reds were the<br />\nOhio version of the Mets (see last<br />\nissue)\u2014never reaching expectations. After finally proving that<br />\nthey could win down the stretch,<br />\nthe Reds must be considered contenders once again.<br />\nPlayer for player, there are few<br />\nteams in baseball that can even<br />\ncompare to the Reds, including<br />\nOakland. Last year's World<br />\nSeries was not a fluke. It was<br />\nsimply a case of one talented team<br />\nbeing hotter than another. What<br />\nwas amazing about the Reds'<br />\n1990 accomplishments was that<br />\nthey were in spite of, not because<br />\nof, OF Eric Davis(.260, 24 HR,<br />\n80 RBI, 21 SB). If Davis could<br />\never stay healthy, he could easily reach the forty-mark in both<br />\nhomers and steals. With Davis<br />\nstruggling, SS Barry Larkin<br />\n(.301, 30 SB), 38 Chris Sabo(25<br />\nHR,25 SB), and OF Paul O'Neill<br />\n(78 RBI)picked up the slack. 1B<br />\nHal Morris (.340) and 2B Bill<br />\nDoran (.373 with Cincinatti) are<br />\nsolid role players. The bench is<br />\nloaded, as 2B Mariano Duncan<br />\n(.306) and OF Glenn Braggs<br />\nwould probably start on another<br />\nclub.<br />\nJose Rijo (14-8, 2.70) finally<br />\nput it together last year, appearing nearly unhittable in the<br />\nplayoffs. He'll be joined in the<br />\nrotation by Tom Browning<br />\n(15-9), Jack Armstrong (11-3<br />\nbefore All-Star break, 1-6 after),<br />\nScott Scudder and Chris Hammond. Scudder and Hammond<br />\nare unproven, but with the Nasty Boys bullpen firing behind<br />\nthem, they don't have to be<br />\nperfect. Randy Myers, Rob Dibble, and Norm Charlton combined for 24 wins, 44 saves, 351<br />\nstrikeouts, and countless hitters'<br />\nheadaches. The Reds are strong,<br />\nconfident, and experienced. But<br />\nthey won't repeat. Just because<br />\nnobody does.<br />\nWhile the Reds were holding<br />\nsteady during the winter transaction frenzy, the Los Angeles<br />\nDodgers were feeding the Hot<br />\nStove fire. They reeled in OF's<br />\nDarryl Strawberry (37 HR, 108<br />\nRBI), OF Brett Butler (.309, 51<br />\nSB), and SP's Bobby Ojeda and<br />\nKevin Gross. With incumbents<br />\n1B Eddie Murray (.330, 26 HR,<br />\n95 RBI) and OF Kal Daniels<br />\n(.296, 27, 94) back for another<br />\nturn, the Dodgers' seem to have<br />\nbuilt a championship roster.<br />\nIn their effort to bolster the<br />\nballclub, the Dodgers front office<br />\nspent an unfathomable amount cif<br />\nmoney. But money can't buy you<br />\nhealth, and that's what the<br />\nDodgers need more than anything<br />\nelse. If SP's Orel Hershiser and<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nTim Belcher are fit, they, along<br />\nwith phenom Ramon Martinez<br />\n(20-6, 2.92), will lift the Dodgers<br />\nto the top. For now, though, there<br />\nseem to be too many questions.<br />\nRelief ace Jay Howell is fragile,<br />\nas is Daniels, and there are no<br />\nguarantees that the rehabilitated<br />\nHershiser will be as effective as<br />\nthe 1989 version.The clubhouse<br />\nis a disaster waiting to happen,<br />\nwith malcontents Strawberry, 2B<br />\nJuan Samuel, and Daniels moping around. Manager Tommy<br />\nLasorda is a master at getting<br />\nteams to over-achieve, but he's<br />\nnever been entrusted with so<br />\nmuch talent. Unless some leaders<br />\n(C Mike Scioscia, Murray) step<br />\nup, the infield is solidified (rookie<br />\nJose Offerman will start at shortstop; Samuel is an error<br />\nmachine), and the arms heal<br />\nquickly, the Dodgers will have<br />\nthird place to show for all of their<br />\nambitious spending.<br />\nSo who'll be standing at the<br />\nfinish? Try the San Francisco<br />\nGiants. All one has to do is look<br />\ninto the eyes of opposing pitchers<br />\nwhen the names Clark, Mitchell,<br />\nand Williams are mentioned. 1B<br />\nWill Clark (.295, 19 HR, 95<br />\nRBI), LF Kevin Mitchell (.290,<br />\n35, 93), and 3B Matt Williams<br />\n(.277, 33, 112) are a murderers<br />\nrow that might fill the '27<br />\nYankees with envy. (Well,<br />\nmaybe not.) Considering that<br />\nMitchell and Clark played hurt in<br />\n1990, it's possible that this trio<br />\ncould drive in 400 runs over a full<br />\nseason, if someone consistently<br />\nreaches base in front of them.<br />\nWith table-setting OF Brett Butler<br />\n<br />\nin L.A., that could be a problem.<br />\nBatting champion OF Willie<br />\nMcGee (.335) was signed to<br />\nreplace Butler, but neither he nor<br />\n2B Robby Thompson is really a<br />\nlead-off man. Regardless, the<br />\nGiants will score in bunches,<br />\neven if they need three home runs<br />\na game to do so.<br />\nThe good news for Manager<br />\nRoger Craig's often-battered pitching staff is that Kelly Downs,<br />\nRick Reuschel, Don Robinson<br />\nand Scott Garrelts are finally<br />\nhealthy. The better news is that<br />\nthe welfare of the 1991 Giants<br />\ndoesn't necessarily rely on their<br />\nwell-being. Free-agent SP Bud<br />\nBlack may be just a .500 lifetime<br />\npitcher, but he's dependable,<br />\nwhich is all that Craig really<br />\nneeds to hear. John Burkett(14-7)<br />\nwas a pleasant rookie surprise,<br />\nand Trevor Wilson will contribute. In the bull-pen, newly<br />\nsigned Dave Righetti (36 saves)<br />\nand Jeff Brantley(19 saves)form<br />\na nice lefty-righty combination.<br />\nIf any of the formerly wounded<br />\n(Downs, Garrelts, etc.) recovers,<br />\nand rookie C Steve Decker can<br />\nhandle the starting duties, the<br />\nGiants will be better-than-average<br />\non the mound. With Clark, Mitchell, and Williams crushing the<br />\nball, that should translate into a<br />\ndivision title.<br />\nAmerica's Team (where did<br />\nTed Turner come up with that,<br />\nanyway?), the Atlanta Braves,<br />\nare once again back in their quest<br />\nfor .500. Will they finally get<br />\nthere?

Despite strong rowing in the<br />\npreliminary heats, both the men's<br />\nheavyweight four and the<br />\nwomen's novice eight failed to<br />\nqualify for the finals, while the<br />\nwomen's heavyweight four did<br />\nnot compete because of an injury<br />\nto one of its rowers.<br />\nThe men's lightweight eight<br />\ngave the small but vocal crowd<br />\nof Hopkins supporters plenty of<br />\nexcitement when they fell behind<br />\nearly to George Washington, but<br />\nthe men's eight maintained its<br />\ncomposure, gradually overtaking<br />\nGeorge Washington for the win.<br />\n\"I was really pleased with the<br />\nway we rowed, because when we<br />\nfell behind early we didn't panic.<br />\nThat was an area we were hoping to improve in from last week.<br />\nWhen we needed power, we got<br />\nit, and we managed to gain on,<br />\nand eventually take George<br />\nWashington,\" said senior cocaptain Rob Porcarelli.<br />\nUnfortunately for Hopkins, the<br />\nother boats of the crew failed to<br />\nmatch the success of the<br />\nlightweight eight, most likely due<br />\nto the fact that Hopkins was<br />\ndistracted by having to host the<br />\nregatta. As host, the members of<br />\nthe crew were responsible for<br />\nsuch logistics as assembling the<br />\ncourse, repairing the starting<br />\ndocks, handling concessions at<br />\nthe race, and providing lodging<br />\nfor over 150 visiting rowers. The<br />\ndistractions of hosting the regatta were a definite handicap for<br />\nsome of Hopkins' rowers.<br />\n\"We definitely expected to do<br />\na lot better,\" said junior Eric<br />\n<br />\nPlautz, a member of the men's<br />\nheavyweight four. \"I think<br />\nhosting tired us out mentally and<br />\nphysically. It was draining<br />\nbecause there were a lot of things<br />\nto do and worry about.\"<br />\nAlthough the women's novice<br />\neight failed to qualify for the<br />\nfinals, freshman coxswain<br />\nStephanie Fishkin felt her boat<br />\ncontinued to gain experience at<br />\nthe regatta.<br />\n\"I think we rowed really well<br />\nlast week. I see a lot of improvement each week we row, and I<br />\nthink we're going to continue to<br />\nget better,\" said Fishlcin.<br />\nThe overall Hopkins performance was most certainly affected by the absence of the<br />\nwomen's heavyweight four,<br />\nwhich was expected to cruise to<br />\nan easy victory at the Invitational.<br />\nThe women's four was forced to<br />\nwithdraw when a team member,<br />\njunior Jen Ehringer, developed<br />\nback problems.<br />\n\"It was really disappointing not<br />\nbeing able to row because we<br />\nknew we could win, but it was<br />\njust one of those things you can't<br />\ncontrol,\" said senior Kathleen<br />\nMcCabe, a rower on the<br />\nwomen's four.<br />\nThe women's four hopes to<br />\nhave Ehringer back this week so<br />\nthey can row at the George<br />\nWashington Invitational, where<br />\nthey will face such crews as<br />\nGeorge Washington and Carnegie<br />\nMellon. The race is especially<br />\nimportant for the women because<br />\nits results help to determine the<br />\nall-important seedings for the<br />\nDad Vail Regatta at the end of the<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe men's heavyweight four<br />\nwill hope to improve upon last<br />\nweek's performance although<br />\nthey will face a very competitive<br />\nfield, including boats from<br />\nGeorgetown, Navy, and George<br />\nWashington.<br />\n\"I think we've had a few problems that we've worked out, so<br />\nI think we have a good chance of<br />\ndoing fairly well,\" said Plautz.<br />\n<br />\nby Lorin Engquist<br />\n<br />\nGeorge Washington notified<br />\nthe men's lightweight eight at last<br />\nweek's regatta that there will be<br />\na weigh-in at this week's regatta; each rower on the men's eight<br />\nmust therefore drop two to eight<br />\npoints within a week's time so the<br />\nboat can make the weight limit for<br />\ncompetition. If it does qualify,<br />\nPorcarelli said the boat has a<br />\nvendetta against Georgetown.<br />\n\"All my three years here we've<br />\nlost to Georgetown; they've<br />\nhumbled us, and I would like to<br />\ntake them down this year.

According to head coach Bill Nelson,<br />\nBraude \"looked like he played his<br />\nbest tennis of the season.\" Near<br />\nthe end of the match, Braude asked his teammates what the overall<br />\nscore was.

Mary<br />\nEllen Porter, the head of the Panhellenic Council, described the<br />\nprocess by which Delta Gamma<br />\nwas chosen.

Schools which were<br />\nresearch-orientated and highpressure with a high standard of<br />\nacademic excellence were<br />\nconsidered.<br />\nThe list of prospective<br />\nsororities was then narrowed<br />\ndown to three or four top choices,<br />\naccording to Porter. The selected<br />\nsororities came to Hopkins to<br />\nmake presentations on campus,<br />\nand Delta Gamma was selected.<br />\nPorter said that it might not be<br />\nnecessary to go through the entire 21;.ocess again. The<br />\nPanhellenic Council may review<br />\nother sororities who made presentations with Delta Gamma. If the<br />\nsororities still showed interest,<br />\nthey would be invited to make<br />\npresentations so that another<br />\nsorority could be chosen.<br />\nPorter said, however, that<br />\nnothing is definite at this time. A<br />\ngreat deal of organization lies<br />\nahead, she said, but most of the<br />\npeople involved feel it is<br />\nestablishing another sorority at<br />\nHopkins to satisfy the increased<br />\ninterest in Greek life.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nNon-Profit Criteria<br />\nTo Be Reviewed<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\nO'Shea added that the University's General Counsel office<br />\n\"does not believe that [the Fair<br />\nchairs] were under obligation to<br />\noffer Mr. Ryan a space, or that<br />\n[the chairs] violated any rules.\"<br />\nO'Shea also said that the General<br />\nCounsel had begun consulting<br />\nwith Quarles and Mansfield about<br />\nestablishing explicit criteria for<br />\nbooth applications in the future.<br />\nThough pleased with his<br />\ngroup's acceptance, Ryan still<br />\nbelieves that the action of the<br />\nchairs warrants further scrutiny.<br />\nIn a telephone interview, he<br />\nobserved that \"this is not the only time that men's concerns have<br />\ngotten rough treatment [at Johns<br />\nHopkins].\" He cited as evidence<br />\na recent decision to penalize Tau<br />\nEpsilon fraternity for a hostile en-<br /><br />\ncounter with a female, neighbor<br />\nand a recent University Conference on Student Health that he<br />\nfelt contained sexist undertones.<br />\nWhen grouped with the actions of<br />\nthe Fair chairs, Ryan said, the incidents suggest a pattern of \"evident sexism\" in several arms of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nAlthough Ryan said earlier that<br />\nhe had filed a civil discrimination<br />\nsuit with the Maryland Human<br />\nRelations Commision (MHRC)<br />\nagainst the University, he did not<br />\nmake it clear whether he would<br />\npursue the case.

It<br />\nwill be even worse next year,<br />\nwhen we spread out all over this<br />\nbeautiful city. As a \"New Kid\"<br />\npledge to Delta Upsilon, I know<br />\nthat fraternity parties fill much of<br />\nthis social void, be we can have<br />\neven more quality entertainment<br />\nat JHU: speakers, bands you've<br />\nheard of, etc. All we need is<br />\nmotivated leadership and MORE<br />\nFUNDING.

He must be willing to<br />\nlisten to everyone's concerns, and<br />\nbe persuasive enough to have<br />\nthese concerns heard. Certainly,<br />\nI have some ideas about how to<br />\nimprove the general atmosphere<br />\nat JHU. But I can only promise a<br />\nvoice in government, one not<br />\nafraid to stir a little controversy if<br />\nit's necessary to get the job done.<br />\nAll other promises would likely be<br />\nempty and unfulfilled, just as<br />\nthey've been at every election in<br />\nhistory.<br />\nCurrently, I am the president of<br />\nmy fraternity pledge class and will<br />\ntake over as News-Letter sports<br />\neditor next fall. I believe that my<br />\ninvolvement with the News-Letter<br />\nwill prove useful, since there is no<br />\nbetter medium than a student<br />\npublication. Although I am pledging a fraternity, I strongly feel that<br />\nclass unity must exist in addition<br />\nto Greek life\u2014working together,<br />\nnot against each other. Finally, as<br />\na Writing Semiars major, I have<br />\nmore time than most (or so people say) to devote to Student<br />\nCouncil.

Freshman applications were up 17 percent from last year,<br />\nan increase made even more impressive at a time when many\u2014<br />\nincluding this publication\u2014feared that the University's public image was in decline. The new admissions figures suggest otherwise:<br />\nobviously a new group of some of the country's best students is more<br />\nthan willing to take its chances at Hopkins, and at a minimum of<br />\n$16,000 a year. Admissions has clearly done an excellent job of drawing a bevy of impressive applicants. Now the tricky part: Why is<br />\nit, as Director of Admissions Rit Fuller noted, that Johns Hopkins<br />\nis \"at the tail end with our peer institutions in terms of accepted<br />\nstudents who enroll\"?<br />\nOne obvious answer is that Hopkins lacks the prestige of Harvard<br />\nor Yale or Stanford, which is not exactly news. But if the University<br />\ncan't beat those schools at their own game\u2014name brand recognition<br />\nand word-of-mouth advertising\u2014it might try to make a name for itself<br />\nin some other categories.<br />\nCampus Diversity\u2014Kobi Little's observation on page 2 that<br />\nHopkins \"is not keeping pace with other universities of its caliber\"<br />\non issues of minority recruiting and cultural awareness may seem<br />\na tired issue, but it is undeniably correct. With all of the nascent<br />\nmovements to promote awareness and tolerance within the University community, only the Black Student Union has been a consistent<br />\nadvocate of more far-reaching recruiting efforts in the ongoing search<br />\nfor qualified freshmen. Admissions can point proudly to its large,<br />\nvaried Asian-American and foreign-student populations\u2014why not extend the diversity further, and include greater numbers of AfricanAmericans and Hispanics? This is easier said than done, the NewsLetter realizes, but diversity and tolerance are also easier to appreciate<br />\nin an environment that puts its minorities in the majority.<br />\nFaculty Members\u2014While the University continues to knock itself<br />\nout promoting its research-over-teaching ethic, discontent among<br />\nfaculty members continues to move in silently and ominously, like<br />\na fleet of enemy ships on the horizon. If President Richardson's incessant fundraising yields any fruit, it should go toward filling some<br />\nof the yawning holes in research and teaching-assistant funds\u2014just<br />\nto name two\u2014and as quickly as possible. Let no one in the administration think that a jump in applications means their work is finished,<br /><br />\nor even relieved. Great minds and great teachers are being lost\u2014<br />\nmost recently William Freehling of the Department of History, who<br />\ntook a position at another school because Hopkins, he said, is \"a<br />\nresearch institution that doesn't give its faculty members what they<br />\nneed to do research and teach responsibly.\" For those who didn't<br />\nknow Dr. Freehling, imagine the loss of David Olton in Psychology,<br />\nRichard Macksey in the Humanities Center, or Steven David in<br />\nPolitical Science, and the void left by Freehling\u2014especially in<br />\nteaching\u2014is easier to appreciate. The University will have trouble<br />\nenough trying to replace one such talent. It ought to bend over<br />\nbackwards to ensure that it doesn't lose another.<br />\nCommunity\u2014Before Admissions sends out another of its elegantly<br />\nproduced brochures to prospective students, it might consider asking the administration to loosen up the pursestrings for a new student union and a greater HOP budget, to name only two pressing<br />\nneeds. More students at Hopkins take it for granted that their peers<br />\nare a little cold; that yeah, a lot are just plain jerks; and that they<br />\ndon't often get a chance to meet people. It doesn't have to be so dire.<br />\nThe News-Letter believes that a campus spot for after-hours dancing<br />\nand (yes, we'll say it) drinking would do wonders for the atmosphere<br />\nhere at Hopkins. It may not be priority\u2014student concerns never are\u2014<br />\nbut administrators looking for a more cohesive, active student community could hardly spend their money in a better way. And it will<br />\npay off in spades when prospectives come and actually find the people having fun.<br />\nDisconnected as these three phenomena might seem; they all directly<br />\naffect the atmosphere at\u2014and eventually the public image of\u2014the<br />\nUniversity. A diverse student population sets a good example for<br />\nother schools and suggests that Hopkins' commitment to providing<br />\nquality education is more than skin- or checkbook-deep. Support for<br />\nfaculty members encourages better teaching, which yields bettereducated students, which yields a better image for the University.<br />\nAnd a more tightly knit student community would benefit everyone<br />\nfrom Admissions to Zeniada.<br />\nSmall improvements? Perhaps. But if a better Johns Hopkins is<br />\nthe goal\u2014and we optimistically hope it is\u2014we should shoot for standards that have more resonance than SAT scores, and more depth<br />\nthan an Ivy League reputation. If that won't attract talented incoming freshmen, then perhaps we don't want 'em.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe headline story of the March<br />\n29th issue (GALA Launches First<br />\nAwareness Week)about the gay and<br />\nlesbian groups on the Hopkins campus aroused our interest. In time,<br />\neach member of the JHU community should be involved in the erection<br />\nof the affair exposing jtie,uniqueness<br />\nof his or her intercourse. Such<br />\nstimulating displays should be encouraged; they are the climax of<br />\nmany swell lifestyles.

Thus chlorine<br />\natoms offset the equilibrium<br />\ntowards normal oxygen atoms,<br />\nand the UV wavelengths normally absorbed by ozone reach the<br />\nsurface of the earth where unsuspecting sun bathers soak them<br />\nup.<br />\nThree years ago, an international study during winters from<br />\n1976-1986 found a decrease of 3<br />\npercent in the ozone layer at<br />\nlatitudes above 40 degrees north<br />\nand only 1.7 percent at more<br />\nsouthern latitudes.

Since it is believed that<br /><br />\nwarm weather slows done the<br />\nchemical reactions which deplete<br />\nthe ozone, no readings are taken<br />\nin the summer. In the new NASA<br />\nstudy, scientists recorded<br />\ndecreases in ozone levels in April<br />\nand May of6 percent and 4 percent in the northern and southern<br />\nregions respectively.

Do you know<br />\nabout chaos?\"<br />\n\"If I knew about chaos, I<br />\nwouldn't be quite so intimately<br />\nfamiliar with it.\"<br />\nShe clicked her nostrils impatiently. I mistook her irritation for<br />\naffectionate sympathy and offered<br />\nher a stick of gum, but she ignored my antics. Chaos theory,<br />\nshe explained, stated that apparently chaotic phenomena, like<br />\nthe weather, actually followed<br />\nsome hidden pattern. Halfway<br />\nthrough the conversation, she<br />\npulled out a colorful book that<br />\nsaid something about \"Chaos\"<br />\non the front, and smacked its<br />\ncover every time she said the<br />\nword \"chaos.\" Soon, she started<br /><br />\nPer Jambeck<br /><br />\nEnough<br />\ncalling out the word \"chaos\" in<br />\nthe same way that people announced that they had won the<br />\nBlack Death sweepstakes during<br />\nthe Middle Ages. At first, I<br />\nthought that something was<br />\nwrong, but soon I realized that<br />\nshe was calling her pet dog,<br />\nChaos. I smiled politely while the<br />\nbeast urinated on my head, then<br />\nexcused myself.<br />\nEvery so often, a science<br />\nbecomes popular. Not long ago,<br />\nit was biotechnology. Before that,<br />\nit was particle physics. Cellular<br />\nautomata were pretty hip for a<br />\nwhile, and there was a time when<br />\nsimply everyone was talking<br />\nabout artificial intelligence. I<br />\ndon't know who determines what<br />\nis worth studying, but I used to<br />\ntry to keep tabs on what was \"in\"<br />\nby going to bookstores and looking for the big, colorful, and<br />\nscience-related covers in the<br />\nbestseller section.<br />\nManny, the guy at the<br />\nbookshop, always used to tell me,<br />\n\"You know, I used to be a<br />\nfamous physicist. Then I caught<br />\non. There's no knowledge in real<br />\nscience anymore. I'm twice the<br />\nman I used to be, now that I have<br />\nthis little store. I've learned so<br />\nmuch!\"<br />\nI nodded and took my receipt.<br />\n\"Say Manny,\" I asked,\"how do<br />\nyou know what's next?

Should I?\"<br />\nI shrugged my shoulders,<br />\nthanked him for the book, and<br />\nshoplifted a set of small children<br />\nas I left. It was just another trip<br />\nto the bookstore for me, but<br />\neverything had changed for the<br />\nformer physicist. That night, he<br />\nprematurely opened a package of<br />\nbooks and read all about the coming miracle of cybernetics. Suddenly, Manny found himself invited to all the good cocktail parties just so he could show off his<br />\nfashionable knowledge of cuttingedge science. Soon, he was addicted, tearing through cognitive<br />\nscience books and astronomy<br />\ntexts several months in advance,<br />\nusing the best facts for party<br />\ngossip, and then selling the dregs<br />\nto wealthy doctoral students and<br />\ngrant writers.<br />\nIn the meantime, the bookshop<br />\nfell into ruin. The pimply youths<br /><br />\nwho now ran the store could only offer their customers yellowed<br />\ncopies of self-help books and<br />\nDanielle Steele novels. And all<br />\nthe while, Manny sent postcards<br />\nfrom the coolest resorts in Lower<br />\nVolta and Glen Burnie, suggesting that he was getting lots of<br />\nsex and drugs with big rock and<br />\nroll stars.<br />\nOne day, I stopped by Manny's<br />\nstore, but it was boarded up.<br />\nSigns in the otherwise-empty<br />\nwindows said that the place<br />\nwould soon be a Thai tie shop.<br />\nTwo guys, each carrying a violin<br />\ncase, walked behind me.

Four of these courses are given<br />\nentirely in English, require no knowledge of a foreign language, and have no prerequisites:<br /><br />\n130.101 (H) Ancient Near Eastern Civilizations (3), MW 10 Schwartz<br />\nAn introduction to the entire ancient Near East, from the first prehistoric farming communities to Alexander the Great. Learn about<br />\nthe first cities and the first empires known. Includes the Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites, Hurrians, Israelites, Egyptians,<br />\nPhoenicians, and Persians. If you want to understand the roots of conflict in the Middle East, this is the place to start!<br /><br />\n130.301 (H) History of Ancient Syria-Palestine, including Israel (3), M 3-5 McCarter<br />\nFocuses on the area of modern Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan. Discover the great early civilizations of Syria, including the revolutionary<br />\nfinds from Ebla. Learn how our own alphabet originated in the second millennium BC. Study the emergence of ancient Israel and its interaction<br />\nwith its neighbors. Evaluate the Old Testament as a historical source. In this course, you will do it all!<br /><br />\n130.305 (H) Law in the Ancient World (3), TTh 3 Westbrook<br />\nOur modern concepts of law and justice can be traced directly back to the ancient world. This course will survey the legal systems of the ancient<br />\nNear East and early Greece and Rome from the earliest known records through the fifth century BC. Reading assignments will focus on original<br />\ndocuments, like the Code of Hammurabi, in English translation. Taught by a lawyer, the course will compare the legal concepts of the world's<br />\noldest known systems with those of modern law.<br /><br />\n130.391 (H) Jewish Literature and Civilization (2), W 11-12:30 Smolar<br />\nStudy Jewish literature in translation from early post-biblical times to the present as a mirror of religious and social development, political<br />\ntheory, and philosophical diversity. Taught by the president of the Baltimore Hebrew University.<br />\nIf you like learning new languages, and have been intrigued by Egyptian hieroglyphs or the wedge-shaped cuneiform signs on Babylonian clay<br />\ntablets, you might want to try the following courses. Although they have graduate numbers, undergraduates who apply themselves should have<br />\nno difficulty completing them successfully.<br /><br />\n132.600 (H) Elementary Akkadian (4), TBA Westbrook<br />\nThe language of ancient Babylonia and Assyria, written in cuneiform script. After an introduction to the script and grammar, beginners are<br />\nsoon reading texts that form the basis of Western culture, such as the Flood story and the first great law code.<br /><br />\n133.600 (H) Hieroglyphs: Script and Language of Ancient Egypt (4), TBA Galan<br />\nAn introduction to Middle Egyptian, the classical language of Egyptian hieroglyphs. The same language that was written by King Tut and<br />\nRamses the Great, it is taught at only a handful of universities. A year will make you conversant enough to read some short stories, a few of the<br />\nworld's first medical texts, and inscriptions from statues in museums (amaze your friends!).<br />\nYou may think you know Hebrew, but until you've studied the language of the Bible on its own terms, you only know part of the story. The<br />\nfollowing course will introduce you to the Hebrew of the Bible, unencumbered by post-biblical accretions:<br /><br />\n130.440 Elementary Biblical Hebrew (3), TBA Scott<br />\nNote: Courses marked TBA will be scheduled to suit the convenience of the interested students. Do not let 'MA' deter you from signing up!

As<br />\nin his \"Beyond Therapy,\"<br />\n(which was recently performed<br />\nby the Barnstormers) Durang is<br />\ntaking a shot at those whom we<br />\ntraditionally call our helpers and<br />\nadvisors; in this case, the Church.<br />\nBy means of a hilariously<br />\nscathing lecture by Sister Mary<br />\n(Meg Araneo dressed in full<br />\nhabit), Durang shows us his vision of how fraudulent a Catholic<br />\neducation is.<br />\nYes, this material dangerously skirts the line of offensiveness,<br />\nor at the least, bad taste. Yet it's<br />\nundeniably funny stuff, on a par<br />\nwith Mel Brooks' Inquisition skit.<br />\nThe casting, again, is excellent.<br />\nMeg Araneo's Sister Mary is<br />\nalmost, but not quite, completely ridiculous, as are her<br />\ndisgruntled ex-students Sarah<br />\nMorton, Kenneth Montague,<br />\nJared Bazzy, and Jennifer<br />\nMacLean (with special kudos to<br />\nMorton and Bazzy). Jason<br />\nSullivan's<br />\nseven-year-old<br />\nCatholic zombie, however, steals<br />\nthe show with his utterly straightfaced recitation of the Commandments and his steady gun hand.<br /><br />\nDull and Improbable<br />\nMarrying Man Drags<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nThe Marrying Man is a<br />\nscrewball comedy with heavy<br />\nemphasis on the screw.

But this is yet<br />\nanother Hollywood high-concept<br />\ngone horribly awry, a premise so<br />\nconvinced it can sell itself that the<br />\nfilmmakers might as well have<br />\nturned their brains off when filming began.<br />\nDespite the R rating and a starstudded supporting cast, this<br />\n1950's farce of love and lust is<br />\nsurprisingly tame and bland.<br />\nBaldwin and Basinger, with all<br />\ntheir preening for the camera and<br />\nalleged off-screen fire, lack the<br />\nchemistry of a test tube. It's a<br />\nbeauty contest with two contestants, and a tie for second<br />\nplace.<br />\nBaldwin is playboy Charley<br />\nPearl, heir to an unseen but freely spent fortune built by his father<br />\nin the toothpaste industry. Irresponsible and attractive,<br />\nCharley is originally engaged to<br />\nAdele Horner (Elisabeth Shue,<br />\nlooking awfully plain), daughter<br />\nof Lew Horner(Robert Loggia),<br /><br />\n\"The Most Powerful Man in<br />\nHollywood.\"<br />\nBut marriage plans collapse at<br />\nthe last minute when Charley<br />\ntravels to Las Vegas with his buddies, and spots the warbling<br />\nnightclub singer Vicki Anderson<br />\n(Basinger) strutting her stuff in a<br />\ngambling joint.

Most<br />\nof the time their tempestuous<br /><br />\nCharley Pearl (Alec Baldwin) and Vicki Anderson (Kim Basinger)<br />\nconnect and disconnect endlessly in the tiresome The Marrying Man.<br /><br />\ning to be. It's a vicious, predictable cycle, methodically executed<br />\nto such an extent that by the<br />\nfourth marriage, the whole<br />\nroutine seems not only boring,<br />\nbut ludicrously improbable. One<br />\nwishes that Siegel had offet1 the<br />\ncouple the first time around and<br />\nsaved everybody a lot of trouble.<br />\nWhen asked by one of his<br />\nfriends why a man would marry<br />\nthe same woman four times,<br />\nCharley responds, \"it fits.\" This<br />\nweak rejoinder typifies the flaws<br />\nin The Marrying Man: not for one<br />\nsecond do we buy the main relationship, and even more importantly, not for one second do we<br />\ncare.<br />\nMuch has been made of Kim<br />\nBasinger's vocals in The Marrying Man, and her tunes come<br />\nacross with a strength meant to<br />\ndefine her character. But the passion is antiseptic and forgettable;<br />\nit can't hold a candle to Michelle<br />\nPfeiffer's work in The Fabulous<br />\nBaker Boys for instance. The soul<br />\nin Vicki's voice washes away in<br />\nhagglin with Charley, too weak<br />\nto sing all this film's plot blues<br />\naway.<br />\nIf it had been executed properly, there's enough material in the<br />\nopening moments of The Marrying Man to sustain an entire picture. But screenwriter Neil Simon<br />\nseems to work under the impression that he's writing a play, not<br />\na film, and the entire exercise<br />\ndrags on endlessly. By the end,<br />\nthe only vow you'll want Vicki<br />\nand Charley to take is a vow of<br />\nsilence.<br /><br />\nupcom;n3 procluct:ons from the<br />\nqu;ckest dram tits in the. west!<br /><br />\nWI1N\"-E55 174:L'ATz'R<br /><br />\n10(JC<br />\n'OF Vic.roRY, rH koNY OF\"<br />\nVIOC-NT\" AND CUNN1Al<br />\n=-)-.(P-aziMa_nirAL- 4V4Nr-4ARIY:<br />\n1,17,Amq or A MAN WHo<br />\nRAy ABour A SPRinir WileRat.<br />\ng s t.aigs<br />\ni-irS TO<br />\nSTUBS<br />\nOM OF r-145_ RuNtr-..:Rs<br /><br />\nr'F_xtrAPLAKIAL<br />\nI.Nr-ssruit.a.\"<br />\nA G uv Ga-,rs caucor<br />\nIN A SIG iNDusrgaii,<br />\nvisa.<br /><br />\n1\u20221<br /><br />\n\u2022-\u2022\";)#--<br /><br />\n24.3 SE'coe41&gt;S<br /><br />\nTIM6: 11.2. 5.z.:-001.1bS<br /><br />\nbrev;t<br /><br />\nTrms; 0.4 Stu...rips<br /><br />\nars ionaa<br /><br />\nrtRAms:\" THE Stioitral2 THaZ.ErrEiz<br />\nOt2. \"ggiE-r-s 44' VirAL.

I literally collapsed on my<br />\nsleeping bag in the gym. No surprise, Jodie had arrived a full<br />\nhour earlier.

The<br />\nrain and wind also made for a<br />\nparticularly chilly ride, and even<br />\nwith my windbreaker I shivered<br />\non the slight and brief downhills.<br />\nThe route passed through the<br />\nback roads behind NASA in<br />\nGreenbelt, but I was too<br />\nmiserable to be interested. The<br />\nrain was so horrible I began<br />\ndrinking the water dripping off of<br />\nmy helmet and face, more the<br />\nconsequence of an open mouth<br />\nthan a matter of choice.

The second text, Treaties of<br />\nDivine Love,combined banquets,<br />\nbutterflies, and elephants in an<br />\nexplanation of marital and sexual<br />\netiquette for young women.

Gebelein's enthusiasm helped to create a<br />\ndynamic student group that<br />\npushed the lacrosse team to victory after victory with their<br />\nmusic. The Band began as an<br />\noutlet for students wanting to play<br />\ninstrumental music and it<br />\nevolved into a pep band for<br />\nlacrosse and a banjo club that<br />\nbecame extinct after World War<br />\nGebelein affectionately known<br />\nas \"Gebby,\" was given the honor<br />\nof having the Stadium named<br />\nafter him in 1967. He retired in<br />\n1971 and the current director,<br />\nLarry Springer, continues the<br />\ntradition of Gebby's enthusiasm.<br />\nAccording to Mike Dante,<br />\npresident of the Band, this student<br />\ngroup is full of hard-working,<br />\ndedicated people who are nevertheless a lot of fun and enjoy<br />\nplaying music. Dante is especially<br />\ngrateful to his co-officers, VicePresident Jennifer Sosnowski,<br />\nBusiness Manager Scott Needle,<br />\nSecretary Lisa Enz, Publicity<br />\nManager Jeff Weller, Jazz Direc-<br /><br />\ntor Chris Kelley, and Librarian<br />\nSandeep Singhal. \"They all<br />\ndeserve to be mentioned because<br />\nthe Band is really a team effort,\"<br />\nDante said.<br />\nThe group is now subdivided<br />\ninto three different groups.

No disposable cup<br />\ncan prove itself ecologically<br />\nsound when compared to reusable<br />\nchina. It's unrealistic, however,<br />\nto suggest that disposables be<br />\neliminated; given such a situation, paper products are<br />\npreferable to those of<br />\npolystyrene.<br />\nFrom the beginning, polystyrene presents environmental<br />\nproblems that are more serious<br />\nthan those presented by producing paper. The most serious of<br />\nthese is the use of pentane,<br />\nstyrene, and benzene. Pentane is<br />\nnow used as a blowing agent instead of the ozone-depleting<br />\nchlorofluorocarbons. While pentane does little or no damage to<br />\nthe ozone in the stratosphere, it<br />\ncreates ozone at ground level.<br />\nOzone at this level is a contributor<br /><br />\nto smog and has been proven to<br />\ncause lung damage and immune<br />\nsystem problems. Pentane is also<br />\nhighly explosive and creates job<br />\nhazards in the factories. Other job<br />\nhazards associated with the production of polystyrene include<br />\nskin diseases, cancer, lung problems, and kidney diseases. Of<br />\nchemicals produced in the United<br />\nStates, polystyrene production<br />\ncreates the fifth largest amount of<br />\nhazardous waste.<br />\nThere are problems with producing paper cups. First is the<br />\nresources required. While wood<br />\nis a renewable resource, current<br />\nlogging practices are exceedingly poor. Clearcutting is a problem<br />\nwith all wood-related products.<br />\nStill, sustainable logging practices<br />\ndo exist, which, if more widely<br />\nused, would allow the harvesting<br />\nof trees without undue damage to<br />\nthe environment. The other problem is that paper production is<br />\ninefficient. One answer is to use<br />\nrecycled paper. Although producing paper requires more energy<br />\nthan polystyrene and creates a<br /><br />\nTorn Robbins<br />\n\"The man is a vital natural resource.\"<br />\n\u2014Portland Oregonian<br /><br />\nskinny<br />\nlegs<br />\nand<br />\nall<br /><br />\n\"Robbins' comic<br />\nphilosophical musing<br />\nreveals a flamboyant<br />\ngenius.\"\u2014People<br />\n\"A euphoric wonder<br />\nwork.\"\u2014Los Angeles<br />\nTimes<br />\n\"Filled with<br />\nyouthful erotic<br />\nenergy...and a<br />\nplayful sense of<br />\nhumor about<br />\neven the most<br />\nprofound<br />\nmatters...<br />\nFlat-out funny<br />\nand fabulous.\"<br />\n\u2014Playboy<br /><br />\nhigher volume of air and water<br />\nemissions, the contaminants from<br />\npolystyrene are more dangerous.<br />\nNeither polystyrene nor paper<br />\ncups can be disposed of harmlessly. Principal arguments against<br />\npaper are that it cannot be recycled, that it does not always<br />\ndecompose, and that when it does<br />\ndecompose, it produces methane<br />\nand carbon dioxide, greenhouse<br />\ngasses. It is true that waxed paper<br />\ncups cannot be recycled. It is also<br />\ntrue that while there is technology<br />\nto recycle polystyrene, it is<br />\nneither available nor environmentally sound. Recycling polystyrene releases, once again, pentane, benzene, and styrene. Much<br />\nof Baltimore's waste is currently<br />\nincinerated, not recycled, including most of the polystyrene<br />\nand paper cups used. Incinerating<br />\npaper produces methane and carbon dioxide; the EPA says that<br />\nincinerating polystyrene produces<br />\n57 toxic chemicals.<br />\nPaper might not always decompose in landfills, but polystyrene<br />\nnever decomposes anywhere.<br /><br />\nPolystyrene that finds its way into<br />\nthe oceans is often mistaken by<br />\nanimals for food and ingested a<br />\npainful death. Almost 25 percent<br />\nof all floating debris in the ocean<br />\nis polystyrene. Polystyrene that<br />\nends up in landfills can leach<br />\nstyrene, benzene, and pentane<br />\ninto nearby water supplies. The<br />\nmethane and carbon dioxide produced by paper would be produced by the wood left to rot on<br />\nthe forest floor. Any decomposing natural substance produces<br />\nmethane and carbon dioxide.<br />\nPolystyrene doesn't have this probecause it never<br />\nblem<br />\ndecomposes.<br />\nEven if paper and polystyrene<br />\nwere equal in all environmental<br />\nrespects, there is a critical difference between them.

Since<br />\nstyrene is not a naturally occurring substance, they concluded<br />\nthat the source of this styrene was<br />\npolystyrene cups.<br />\nThe real answer is not to use<br />\ndisposable cups at all. Both paper<br />\nand polystyrene cups present environmental problems. Because<br />\nthey are reused many times, nondisposable cups, such as glass or<br />\nchina, present a small fraction of<br />\nthe problems of disposables on a<br />\nper use basis. Many places that<br />\noffer disposable cups will not ob-<br /><br />\nject if you bring your own mug.<br />\nSome places even give a discount<br />\nif you do. Arguing the relative<br />\nmerits of paper or polystyrene<br />\nobscures the fact that neither is a<br />\nviable option compared to<br />\nreusable cups; the debate raises<br />\na complex issue with a simple<br />\nanswer.

The top two teams in<br />\nDivision I lacrosse squared off in<br />\na battle for national bragging<br />\nrights. Unfortunately for the Blue<br />\nJays, the top-ranked Tar Heels of<br />\nthe University of North Carolina<br />\ncan brag\u2014for now. The Tar<br />\nHeels defeated Hopkins 11-6<br />\nbeneath a Carolina blue sky to remain undefeated and top ranked.<br />\nIn a game that was closer than the<br />\nscore indicated, Carolina (7-0)<br />\nused a third-quarter surge to pull<br />\nahead of the Jays 8-4 in front of<br />\n5700 fans at Fetzer Field. At least<br />\nthe Blue Jays finished the<br />\ntoughest stretch of their schedule<br />\n(Syracuse in the Carrier Dome,<br />\nthen No. 1 UVa, and at NO. 1<br />\nUNC)with two victories. That's<br />\ntwo more than the experts<br />\npredicted before the season<br />\nstarted as all three teams were<br />\nranked above Hopkins. At 4-2 on<br />\nthe year the Jays are now the<br />\nfourth ranked team, behind<br />\nCarolina, Princeton, and Brown.<br />\nHopkins jumped out to a 2-0<br />\nlead 4 minutes and 38 seconds into the game on goals 29 seconds<br /><br />\napart. Junior Jeff Wills opened<br />\nthe scoring off a cross field feed<br />\nfrom Matt Panetta. After the goal<br />\nCarolina was called for unnecessary roughness and the Jays<br />\nscored on the ensuing extra-man<br />\nopportunity. Panetta, at the top of<br />\nthe restraining box, found Seth<br />\nTierney, playing with a broken<br />\nwrist for the second week, in<br />\nfront of the cage where he released a five-yard shot over UNC<br />\ngoalie Andy Piazza's shoulder.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense looked like<br />\nit was about to continue where it<br />\nleft off after last week's Virginia<br />\nvictory but that was not to be.<br />\nPlaying on their home grass<br />\nfield (beautifully manicured to<br />\nlook like a golf fairway), the Tar<br />\nHeels used their deep bench and<br />\noverall team speed to control the<br />\ntempo of the game until the final<br />\nbuzzer. After tying the game two<br />\nminutes later on goals 18 seconds<br />\napart, UNC began dictating play.<br />\nAlthough the Heels did do a good<br />\njob of keeping Hopkins in the<br />\ngame thoughout the first half by<br />\nfailing to convert several fast<br />\nbreak opportunities and missing<br />\nthe 6x6 on still more, they seemed to be slowly taking control of<br />\nthe game. The final statistics<br />\nwould suggest the same; the Jays<br />\nwere outshot 51-35 for the after-<br /><br />\nnoon. Of those, Hopkins put 23<br />\non net compared to Carolina's 31.<br />\nGiven the chance, Hopkins<br />\ntook the lead back at 3-2 on an<br />\nincredibly no-angle shot by Brendan Cody. The play was a great<br />\nindividual effort but it marked the<br />\nbeginning of the end. Without the<br />\ncutting and the movement from<br />\nthe other players on the offensive<br />\nend the Jays were bound to get into trouble. But while Hopkins<br />\nlooked to get back in the swing<br />\nthey were missing their own<br />\nchances, too. Hopkins hit the pipe<br />\non at least three occasions in the<br />\nfirst half. Any one of those could<br />\nhave been a goal, and an important one, but the bounces were not<br />\ngoing the Blue Jay way.<br />\nAs both teams did their best to<br />\nkeep the game close, Carolina<br />\nstarted to crank up a talented offense led by Michael Thomas and<br />\nJohn Webster. With the transition<br />\ngame getting into gear, Carolina<br />\nwas getting into what they do<br />\nbest. \"They live and die by controlling the tempo,\" noted Blue<br />\nJay coach Tony Seaman. And that<br />\nis exactly what happened. Both<br />\nThomas and Webster recorded<br />\nthree goals and one assist on the<br />\nday. Meanwhile, Brian Voelker<br />\nand Scott Giardina did their best<br />\nto keep the Jays in the fight.<br /><br />\nWorld Champion Reds Have Fair<br />\nChance to Win Division Again<br />\nby Ethan Skolnick<br />\nBefore capturing last year's<br />\nNational League West crown,<br />\nthe Cincinnati Reds were the<br />\nOhio version of the Mets (see last<br />\nissue)\u2014never reaching expectations. After finally proving that<br />\nthey could win down the stretch,<br />\nthe Reds must be considered contenders once again.<br />\nPlayer for player, there are few<br />\nteams in baseball that can even<br />\ncompare to the Reds, including<br />\nOakland. Last year's World<br />\nSeries was not a fluke. It was<br />\nsimply a case of one talented team<br />\nbeing hotter than another. What<br />\nwas amazing about the Reds'<br />\n1990 accomplishments was that<br />\nthey were in spite of, not because<br />\nof, OF Eric Davis(.260, 24 HR,<br />\n80 RBI, 21 SB). If Davis could<br />\never stay healthy, he could easily reach the forty-mark in both<br />\nhomers and steals. With Davis<br />\nstruggling, SS Barry Larkin<br />\n(.301, 30 SB), 38 Chris Sabo(25<br />\nHR,25 SB), and OF Paul O'Neill<br />\n(78 RBI)picked up the slack. 1B<br />\nHal Morris (.340) and 2B Bill<br />\nDoran (.373 with Cincinatti) are<br />\nsolid role players. The bench is<br />\nloaded, as 2B Mariano Duncan<br />\n(.306) and OF Glenn Braggs<br />\nwould probably start on another<br />\nclub.<br />\nJose Rijo (14-8, 2.70) finally<br />\nput it together last year, appearing nearly unhittable in the<br />\nplayoffs. He'll be joined in the<br />\nrotation by Tom Browning<br />\n(15-9), Jack Armstrong (11-3<br />\nbefore All-Star break, 1-6 after),<br />\nScott Scudder and Chris Hammond. Scudder and Hammond<br />\nare unproven, but with the Nasty Boys bullpen firing behind<br />\nthem, they don't have to be<br />\nperfect. Randy Myers, Rob Dibble, and Norm Charlton combined for 24 wins, 44 saves, 351<br />\nstrikeouts, and countless hitters'<br />\nheadaches. The Reds are strong,<br />\nconfident, and experienced. But<br />\nthey won't repeat. Just because<br />\nnobody does.<br />\nWhile the Reds were holding<br />\nsteady during the winter transaction frenzy, the Los Angeles<br />\nDodgers were feeding the Hot<br />\nStove fire. They reeled in OF's<br />\nDarryl Strawberry (37 HR, 108<br />\nRBI), OF Brett Butler (.309, 51<br />\nSB), and SP's Bobby Ojeda and<br />\nKevin Gross. With incumbents<br />\n1B Eddie Murray (.330, 26 HR,<br />\n95 RBI) and OF Kal Daniels<br />\n(.296, 27, 94) back for another<br />\nturn, the Dodgers' seem to have<br />\nbuilt a championship roster.<br />\nIn their effort to bolster the<br />\nballclub, the Dodgers front office<br />\nspent an unfathomable amount cif<br />\nmoney. But money can't buy you<br />\nhealth, and that's what the<br />\nDodgers need more than anything<br />\nelse. If SP's Orel Hershiser and<br />\n1<br /><br />\nTim Belcher are fit, they, along<br />\nwith phenom Ramon Martinez<br />\n(20-6, 2.92), will lift the Dodgers<br />\nto the top. For now, though, there<br />\nseem to be too many questions.<br />\nRelief ace Jay Howell is fragile,<br />\nas is Daniels, and there are no<br />\nguarantees that the rehabilitated<br />\nHershiser will be as effective as<br />\nthe 1989 version.The clubhouse<br />\nis a disaster waiting to happen,<br />\nwith malcontents Strawberry, 2B<br />\nJuan Samuel, and Daniels moping around. Manager Tommy<br />\nLasorda is a master at getting<br />\nteams to over-achieve, but he's<br />\nnever been entrusted with so<br />\nmuch talent. Unless some leaders<br />\n(C Mike Scioscia, Murray) step<br />\nup, the infield is solidified (rookie<br />\nJose Offerman will start at shortstop; Samuel is an error<br />\nmachine), and the arms heal<br />\nquickly, the Dodgers will have<br />\nthird place to show for all of their<br />\nambitious spending.<br />\nSo who'll be standing at the<br />\nfinish? Try the San Francisco<br />\nGiants. All one has to do is look<br />\ninto the eyes of opposing pitchers<br />\nwhen the names Clark, Mitchell,<br />\nand Williams are mentioned. 1B<br />\nWill Clark (.295, 19 HR, 95<br />\nRBI), LF Kevin Mitchell (.290,<br />\n35, 93), and 3B Matt Williams<br />\n(.277, 33, 112) are a murderers<br />\nrow that might fill the '27<br />\nYankees with envy. (Well,<br />\nmaybe not.) Considering that<br />\nMitchell and Clark played hurt in<br />\n1990, it's possible that this trio<br />\ncould drive in 400 runs over a full<br />\nseason, if someone consistently<br />\nreaches base in front of them.<br />\nWith table-setting OF Brett Butler<br /><br />\nin L.A., that could be a problem.<br />\nBatting champion OF Willie<br />\nMcGee (.335) was signed to<br />\nreplace Butler, but neither he nor<br />\n2B Robby Thompson is really a<br />\nlead-off man. Regardless, the<br />\nGiants will score in bunches,<br />\neven if they need three home runs<br />\na game to do so.<br />\nThe good news for Manager<br />\nRoger Craig's often-battered pitching staff is that Kelly Downs,<br />\nRick Reuschel, Don Robinson<br />\nand Scott Garrelts are finally<br />\nhealthy. The better news is that<br />\nthe welfare of the 1991 Giants<br />\ndoesn't necessarily rely on their<br />\nwell-being. Free-agent SP Bud<br />\nBlack may be just a .500 lifetime<br />\npitcher, but he's dependable,<br />\nwhich is all that Craig really<br />\nneeds to hear. John Burkett(14-7)<br />\nwas a pleasant rookie surprise,<br />\nand Trevor Wilson will contribute. In the bull-pen, newly<br />\nsigned Dave Righetti (36 saves)<br />\nand Jeff Brantley(19 saves)form<br />\na nice lefty-righty combination.<br />\nIf any of the formerly wounded<br />\n(Downs, Garrelts, etc.) recovers,<br />\nand rookie C Steve Decker can<br />\nhandle the starting duties, the<br />\nGiants will be better-than-average<br />\non the mound. With Clark, Mitchell, and Williams crushing the<br />\nball, that should translate into a<br />\ndivision title.<br />\nAmerica's Team (where did<br />\nTed Turner come up with that,<br />\nanyway?), the Atlanta Braves,<br />\nare once again back in their quest<br />\nfor .500. Will they finally get<br />\nthere? Well, no\u2014but they will be<br />\nbetter than the Astros (isn't<br />\nContinued on page 16<br /><br />\nVoelker limited All American attackman Dennis Goldstein to just<br />\none assist and Scott Giardina continued to stand out with a 20-save<br />\nperformance, including several<br />\nfrom point-blank range.

The result: Panetta<br />\nwas stuck with the ball and dou-<br /><br />\nDonna Williamson<br /><br />\nble and triple teams forced turnovers when there was nobody<br />\nopen to receive a pass.

However, this time it was<br />\nCarolina coach Dave Klarmann<br />\nthat worked the halftime magic.<br />\nAfter the Jays tied the game on<br />\nTierney's second goal of the<br />\ngame, the Heels scored the next<br />\nfour to put Hopkins in a tough<br />\nsituation.

The men's lighweight<br />\neight posted the best finish of the<br />\nday, taking first in a close race<br />\nagainst boats from George<br />\nWashington University and<br />\nLaSalle, while the men's novice<br />\neight finished third in their division. Despite strong rowing in the<br />\npreliminary heats, both the men's<br />\nheavyweight four and the<br />\nwomen's novice eight failed to<br />\nqualify for the finals, while the<br />\nwomen's heavyweight four did<br />\nnot compete because of an injury<br />\nto one of its rowers.<br />\nThe men's lightweight eight<br />\ngave the small but vocal crowd<br />\nof Hopkins supporters plenty of<br />\nexcitement when they fell behind<br />\nearly to George Washington, but<br />\nthe men's eight maintained its<br />\ncomposure, gradually overtaking<br />\nGeorge Washington for the win.<br />\n\"I was really pleased with the<br />\nway we rowed, because when we<br />\nfell behind early we didn't panic.<br />\nThat was an area we were hoping to improve in from last week.<br />\nWhen we needed power, we got<br />\nit, and we managed to gain on,<br />\nand eventually take George<br />\nWashington,\" said senior cocaptain Rob Porcarelli.<br />\nUnfortunately for Hopkins, the<br />\nother boats of the crew failed to<br />\nmatch the success of the<br />\nlightweight eight, most likely due<br />\nto the fact that Hopkins was<br />\ndistracted by having to host the<br />\nregatta. As host, the members of<br />\nthe crew were responsible for<br />\nsuch logistics as assembling the<br />\ncourse, repairing the starting<br />\ndocks, handling concessions at<br />\nthe race, and providing lodging<br />\nfor over 150 visiting rowers. The<br />\ndistractions of hosting the regatta were a definite handicap for<br />\nsome of Hopkins' rowers.<br />\n\"We definitely expected to do<br />\na lot better,\" said junior Eric<br /><br />\nPlautz, a member of the men's<br />\nheavyweight four. \"I think<br />\nhosting tired us out mentally and<br />\nphysically. It was draining<br />\nbecause there were a lot of things<br />\nto do and worry about.\"<br />\nAlthough the women's novice<br />\neight failed to qualify for the<br />\nfinals, freshman coxswain<br />\nStephanie Fishkin felt her boat<br />\ncontinued to gain experience at<br />\nthe regatta.<br />\n\"I think we rowed really well<br />\nlast week.
