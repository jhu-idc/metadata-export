We<br />\nwant to<br />\npraise<br />\nhighly the acting<br />\nand staging of the<br />\nHomewood Playshoppers' latest<br />\nproduction and yet we wish to<br />\ncriticize the play itself. So in starting let us announce that we thoroughly enjoyed the aforesaid acting and staging. We only want to<br />\nbring out some weak spots in the<br />\nwork of the Playshoppers wherever<br />\nWe noticed them.<br />\nJacques Copeau, Director, Le<br />\nTheatre du Vieux Colombier, Paris,<br />\nwas associated many years with little theatres and their ideas before<br />\nhe wrote La Maison Natale (The<br />\nHome into Which We Are Born),<br />\nyet this play hardly seems the type<br />\nbest suited for little theatre actors.<br />\nThe Homewood Playshop presented<br />\nit January 15, 16, 17, 20 and 21,<br />\nWhich was the first time the production as translated by Ralph Roeder<br />\nwas given in this country.<br />\nAs best as we could discern the<br />\naction of the play seemed to revolve about a shrewd human\u2014he<br />\ndies in the second intermission\u2014<br />\nwho .had underhandedly forced the<br />\nmayor of a small town to give him<br />\nhis (laughter in marriage and his<br />\nfactory, only to have his own children fear him and avoid his presence. The children especially the<br />\nYoungest son, prefer their now<br />\nbroken old grandfather. This old<br />\nrascal, desiring revenge on his sonin-law, influences them to run away<br />\nfrom their father's oppression in<br />\norder to escape the fate of their<br />\nmother, and himself who have<br />\ncracked under the strain.<br />\nThe acting of Stanley Worden<br />\nas the grandfather far surpassed<br />\nthat of the rest. Mr. Worden is<br />\nstill the most valuable man the<br />\nPlayshoppers possess 'andlikewise<br />\nis the only one who retains his<br />\ncharacter, whatever it may be, during the curtain calls.<br />\nThe play itself seemed to us to<br />\nPortray its principal idea fairly<br />\nWell, though a bit morbidly: yet it<br />\nlacked a certain ease in the conversational speeches, many of which<br />\nwere very long. This smoothness<br />\nmay have been lost in the translat-<br />\n<br />\ning, which was evidently no masterpiece. The Playshoppers should<br />\nvary their type of plays a little<br />\nmore and give lowbrows like ourselves a chance once in a while.<br />\nWe did not think John Taylor<br />\nMyers quite lived up to his reputation of having once been in The<br />\nMiracle when he portrayed the<br />\ncharacter of Andre, the idealistic<br />\nson. However we must admit his<br />\nwas the most difficult role in the<br />\nperformance.<br />\nG. H. Pouder in the part of the<br />\nharsh father evidently liked Clayton Hamilton's description of John<br />\nBarrymore's acting with his fingers<br />\nand eyebrows, for to our mind he<br />\nslightly overworked these parts of<br />\nhis anatomy in giving vent to his<br />\nfeelings. Mr. Pouder also seemed<br />\nto lose the value of a few lines and<br />\noften made his speeches while looking directly at the audience. Al-<br />\n<br />\nthough these lines may have had self contained possibilities with bet-- production was worthy of a much<br />\nto be delivered with the gaze fixed ter lines, the excellent cast deserved larger audience than turned out the<br />\nvacantly on some spot, they would a more fitting vehicle.
