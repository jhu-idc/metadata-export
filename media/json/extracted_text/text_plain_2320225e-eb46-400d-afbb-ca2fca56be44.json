Football must support itself and nearly every other sport<br />\nat college financially. Equipment is costly. The expense of bringing<br />\nother teams to Homewood is heavy.<br />\nHopkins football games of the last two years have not been of a<br />\ncalibre that attract a large crowd in spite of conflicting contests, although we hope that this will be the case in the near future. In making up Hopkins 1930 football schedule, Hopkins authorities consulted the officials of the Baltimore Stadium. They were informed<br />\nthat no games were to be scheduled at the Thirty-third street oval<br />\neither on November first or fifteenth. Hence the Haverford and St.<br />\nJohn's games were definitely scheduled at Homewood for these dates.<br />\nNot until June was it announced that the Fireman-Marine game would<br />\nbe played on the first date, and in the middle of July the Navy-Southern Methodist game, scheduled for the fifteenth, was transferred from<br />\nAnnapolis to the Stadium. This is another instance of the lack of cooperation of the Stadium officials. They are not satisfied with providing every city official with complimentary tickets on certain Saturday<br />\nafternoons, but also think nothing of retracting their statements in<br />\norder to furnish free entertainment at least once a week.<br />\nThe Marine-Fireman game would draw few spectators on its merits<br />\nas a football contest. However, due to much publicity, general ballyhoo,<br />\nand door-to-door canvassing a large number of tickets are sold. Hence<br />\na serious conflict is established. The Navy-Southern Methodist game,<br />\nneedless to say, should draw a huge crowd to the Stadium.<br />\nThe Athletic Council having experienced several years of similar<br />\ntreatment was forced to adopt night football. As long as Stadium<br />\nofficials continue to bring into Baltimore out of town teams which<br />\ncarry away with them sumptuous gate receipts, Hopkins will occasionally have to schedule night games.<br />\nWe have not changed our attitude toward night football, but wish<br />\nmerely to point out some of the reasons why it was adopted. We look<br />\nforward to the day when Stadium officials will cooperate or to the day<br />\nwhen Hopkins has games which will draw a large gate in spite of<br />\nStadium contests. Night football is now a necessary evil.<br />\nIt would seem that the city would realize that games between outof-town teams are of no practical benefit to the community. The<br />\nmajority of the money taken in at the gate comes from the pockets of<br />\nBaltimoreans. The money is taken out of town by the institutions and<br />\nspent in other places. Of those few who come from other points to<br />\nsee the game, only a minority stay in Baltimore long enough to spend<br />\nanything. Every big game is a loss rather than a gain to Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\nTHE SPEEDWAY<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nLTHOUGH each and every year students have been urged not to<br />\nuse Gilman Hall tunnel as a speedway, many undergraduates<br />\npersist in doing so. The fact that every wreck sounds like a highpowered car may be the reason. If the practice continues, a serious<br />\naccident will certainly result. No machines are allowed on some college campuses. Some suGh restriction will probably be put upon students<br />\nat this university unless they become more careful. Do not abuse the<br />\nmany privileges that you have at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nOwing to the great demand for<br />\nthe elements course, 8C, Dr.<br />\nWheeler,subsequent to a conference<br />\nwith Dean E. W. Berry, discontinued the advanced course in<br />\npublic speaking in order to allow<br />\nmore time for instruction of the<br />\nbeginners.<br />\n\"The elements course is far more<br />\nimportant at the present and under<br />\nprevalent conditions,\" stated Professor Wheeler.<br />\nThe first semester of elementary<br />\npublic speaking is to be devoted to<br />\npractice in pronunciation, enunciation, poise and interpretation; the<br />\nsecond to preparation, and subsequent delivery, of the final orations<br />\nby individuals.<br />\nDr. Wheeler said one of the<br />\ncourse's features is the Thom Cup<br />\nextemporaneous speaking contest.<br />\nDR.

In the opinion of the majority, the major point to decide<br />\nupon is the tax to be levied upon the<br />\nstudents in the sections. It has<br />\nbeen made clear, too, that every<br />\nmember in the course must attend,<br />\ninasmuch as it is part of the final<br />\nPOLITICS AND FOOTBALL<br />\nexamination.<br /><br />\nEDITORIALS<br /><br />\nWILL BE FOUND HERE<br />\nEXCLUSIVELY<br /><br />\nISAAC HAMBURGER &amp; SONS<br />\nBALTIMORE &amp; HANOVER STS.<br /><br />\nAdvance Course Dropped<br /><br />\nH<br /><br />\nAVING discussed night football from the point of view of the<br />\nstudent, we thinl it only fair to give the view of the athletic<br />\nauthorities. Football must support itself and nearly every other sport<br />\nat college financially. Equipment is costly. The expense of bringing<br />\nother teams to Homewood is heavy.<br />\nHopkins football games of the last two years have not been of a<br />\ncalibre that attract a large crowd in spite of conflicting contests, although we hope that this will be the case in the near future. In making up Hopkins 1930 football schedule, Hopkins authorities consulted the officials of the Baltimore Stadium. They were informed<br />\nthat no games were to be scheduled at the Thirty-third street oval<br />\neither on November first or fifteenth. Hence the Haverford and St.<br />\nJohn's games were definitely scheduled at Homewood for these dates.<br />\nNot until June was it announced that the Fireman-Marine game would<br />\nbe played on the first date, and in the middle of July the Navy-Southern Methodist game, scheduled for the fifteenth, was transferred from<br />\nAnnapolis to the Stadium. This is another instance of the lack of cooperation of the Stadium officials. They are not satisfied with providing every city official with complimentary tickets on certain Saturday<br />\nafternoons, but also think nothing of retracting their statements in<br />\norder to furnish free entertainment at least once a week.<br />\nThe Marine-Fireman game would draw few spectators on its merits<br />\nas a football contest. However, due to much publicity, general ballyhoo,<br />\nand door-to-door canvassing a large number of tickets are sold. Hence<br />\na serious conflict is established. The Navy-Southern Methodist game,<br />\nneedless to say, should draw a huge crowd to the Stadium.<br />\nThe Athletic Council having experienced several years of similar<br />\ntreatment was forced to adopt night football. As long as Stadium<br />\nofficials continue to bring into Baltimore out of town teams which<br />\ncarry away with them sumptuous gate receipts, Hopkins will occasionally have to schedule night games.<br />\nWe have not changed our attitude toward night football, but wish<br />\nmerely to point out some of the reasons why it was adopted. We look<br />\nforward to the day when Stadium officials will cooperate or to the day<br />\nwhen Hopkins has games which will draw a large gate in spite of<br />\nStadium contests. Night football is now a necessary evil.<br />\nIt would seem that the city would realize that games between outof-town teams are of no practical benefit to the community. The<br />\nmajority of the money taken in at the gate comes from the pockets of<br />\nBaltimoreans. The money is taken out of town by the institutions and<br />\nspent in other places. Of those few who come from other points to<br />\nsee the game, only a minority stay in Baltimore long enough to spend<br />\nanything. Every big game is a loss rather than a gain to Baltimore.<br /><br />\nTHE SPEEDWAY<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nLTHOUGH each and every year students have been urged not to<br />\nuse Gilman Hall tunnel as a speedway, many undergraduates<br />\npersist in doing so. The fact that every wreck sounds like a highpowered car may be the reason. If the practice continues, a serious<br />\naccident will certainly result. No machines are allowed on some college campuses. Some suGh restriction will probably be put upon students<br />\nat this university unless they become more careful. Do not abuse the<br />\nmany privileges that you have at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nOwing to the great demand for<br />\nthe elements course, 8C, Dr.<br />\nWheeler,subsequent to a conference<br />\nwith Dean E.
