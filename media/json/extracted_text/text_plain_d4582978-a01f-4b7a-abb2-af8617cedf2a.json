Joyce Winner of Oratorical<br />\nContest and a Handsome Prize.<br />\nGeorgetown Is Second.<br />\n<br />\nThe Times, London, England,<br />\nannounces that a set of 37 remarkable ancient Greek surgical instruments, discovered near the site of<br />\nKolophon, in India, have been<br />\ngiven to Johns Hopkins University<br />\nand will soon be brought to America.<br />\nThey were for a considerable<br />\ntime in the possession of the late<br />\nAlfred 0. Van Lannep, Dutch viceconsul at Smyrna, and have been<br />\ntaken to England.<br />\nThe 'instruments show a type of<br />\nworkmanship unequaled in any<br />\nother specimens extant and generally reveal the very great progress in surgery which the ancients<br />\nhad made.<br />\nTheir date, though somewhat uncertain, was probably the first or<br />\nsecond century A. D. It is possible, however, that it may have<br />\nbeen before the Christian era.<br />\nWith two exceptions, all the instruments are of bronze. The<br />\nblades were originally steel, but in<br />\neach case this metal has been almost completely destroyed by rust.<br />\n<br />\nAt the annual oratorical contest<br />\nunder the auspices of the Maryland Peace Society, held in McCoy Hall last Friday evening, Jerome II. Joyce, the representative<br />\nof Loyola College of Baltimore,<br />\nwas awarded the decision by the<br />\njudges, Rev. C. A. Rubenstein, Dr.<br />\nO. Edward Janney, Mr. W. H.<br />\nMorriss, Ex-Judge Alfred S. Niles<br />\nand Rev. Louis O'Donovan. The<br />\nGeorgetown representative, Bernard<br />\nL. Brady, was announced as a close<br />\nsecond in the minds of the judges.<br />\nThe winner was awarded a prize<br />\nof seventy-five dollars, and is also<br />\nentitled to the privilege of taking<br />\npart in the intercollegiate contest.<br />\nBrady, of Georgetown, who as<br />\nfirst speaker, told of \"The Immediate Needs of the Peace Movement,\u201d displayed the confidence and<br />\nforce of a practiced orator. The<br />\nweak point of his highly polished<br />\noration was a marked exaggeration in his frequent similies and<br />\nmetaphors. He advanced, as his<br />\nview of the needs of the movement<br />\nfor universal peace, a ,highly developed international conference, a<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 3, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\ncompetent international court with<br />\nsupreme power in all cases of international disputes, and an unprejudiced court of inquiry, to<br />\nthrash out every possible difference<br />\namong the powers.<br />\nJoyce delivered his winning speech<br />\nnext, and his strong, straightforward sentences, with just enough<br />\nof comparisons and illustrations to<br />\nmake them clear, made evident his<br />\nskill in presenting complex ideas<br />\nin a clear manner. In discussing<br />\nthe \"Reasonableness of Peace,\" he<br />\nbased his argument on the comparison of the rules of justice and<br />\nmethods of settling disputes among<br />\nindividuals with the methods employed among nations. He pictured<br />\nwar as a bad means, no matter how<br />\njustifiable the end, with the single<br />\nexception of cases of self-defence.<br />\nThe Hopkins man, Moses Baroway, spoke next. Being handicapped by an uneffective delivery,<br />\nhis good points in regard to \"Disillusionment\" as to the professed<br />\nadvantages of war, failed to make<br />\na strong impression. The last<br />\nspeaker, Orville M. Moore, of St.<br />\nJohn's College, though his ideas as<br />\nto a \"Simple Method of Forwarding Universal Peace\" were sound,<br />\nbetrayed a lack of experience when<br />\ncompared with the other orators.<br />\n<br />\nVARSITY DEFEATS THE ALUMNI<br />\nOpens Lacrosse Season on Wet Field by<br />\na 6-to-3 Victory Over the Former<br />\nStars\u2014Varsity in Fine Form.<br />\n<br />\nCaptain Pitts Raleigh's all-star<br />\nalumni twelve was no match for<br />\nthe 'Varsity lacrosse team Saturday, and the old men were defeated six to three.<br />\nOf course no one would even<br />\nsistants, EIulburt and Lowndes,<br />\nhave succeeded in getting together<br />\nan excellent squad, and although the<br />\nprime, but they were just enough<br />\nout of condition to be easy prey<br />\nfor the 'Varsity and make the game<br />\none of interest and thrills.<br />\nCoach Reaney Wolfe and his assistants, Hulburt and Lowndes have<br />\nsucceeded in getting together an<br />\nexcellent squad, and although the<br />\nplaying was a little crude Saturday, because of the slippery field,<br />\nthe team showed that it will be an<br />\nable defender of the intercollegiate<br />\nlacrosse championship, which it now<br />\nholds.<br />\nThe defense is especially strong,<br />\nand the department is better balanced than at attack.

The<br />\nsmall number who did not perhaps<br />\noverlooked the detail.

During the<br />\nscholastic year of 1913-14, the student body has been composed of<br />\n267 undergraduates, distributed as<br />\nfollows: candidates for the degree<br />\nof bachelor of arts, 17o; engineering department, 74, and special students, 12. Of these, 121 men have<br />\ncome out for the four major sports<br />\nrecognized by the Athletic Association. Last 'fall the football team<br />\nattracted 29 men, while at present<br />\nthe lacrosse squad consists of 30<br />\nundergraduates,the baseball team of<br />\n22, and the track and field aggregation of the comparatively large<br />\nnumber of 40 men. This makes a<br />\ntotal of 121 out of 217 students<br />\nwho at one time or another this<br />\nyear have come out for athletics,<br />\nor an average of about 50 per cent.<br />\nof the entire undergraduate body.<br />\nThese figures leave out of account<br />\nthose who are out for the tennis<br />\nteam, as well as medical men and<br />\ngraduate students. These statistics<br />\nlead us to make the safe assumption that Hopkins easily leads all<br />\nother colleges in the percentage of<br />\nundergraduates indulging in officially recognized forms of sport..<br />\nThis may be attributed to the small<br />\nsize of the Hopkins student body,<br />\nbut the fact remains that the undergraduates of this University are,<br />\non the whole, loyal and brim full<br />\nof \"college spirit.\" Alumni and<br />\nstudents fail to take these things<br />\ninto, consideration when discussing<br />\nHopkins athletics. It is the policy<br />\nof the Athletic Association to utilize, as far as possible, only undergraduates, as may be proved from<br />\nthe fact that there are only five<br />\nmedicos and graduates on the lacrosse squad and but three on the<br />\ntrack squad. Baseball claims the<br />\nlargest number of the advanced<br />\nstudents, with two graduates and<br />\nten medical men. When we remember that the undergraduate<br />\ndepartment is the smallest in point<br />\nof numbers of the three great<br />\nbranches of work at Hopkins, we<br />\nmay feel proud of the way athletics<br />\nare regarded here.<br />\nCollege Athletics.<br />\n<br />\nSome interesting data about college athletics have been given out<br />\nrecently by the Research Committee<br />\nof the National Collegiate Association. The conclusion to be drawn<br />\nfrom the majority of the figures<br />\nand facts given, is that only rarely<br />\ndoes the whole student body take<br />\npart in any kind of organized athletics, and that enormous sums are<br />\nspent to condition a very few men<br />\nto represent their colleges in various lines of sport.<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nOne thousand dollars lies in the<br />\ntreasury of the Class of 1917 at<br />\nHarvard.<br />\n* * *<br />\n<br />\nThe Pink Slips,<br />\nBoys!<br />\n<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa at Yale has recently elected 28 men from the<br />\nClass of 1915 to membership.<br />\n* *<br />\n<br />\nHow we like to<br />\nsee them!<br />\n<br />\nAn agricultural library, something which sounds rather enigmatical, has been founded at Illinois<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nThe Michigan Musical Clubs are<br />\nto make a six-thousand-mile tour<br />\nthrough the West, with Los Angeles<br />\nas their goal, during the spring.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nCoach Stagg of Chicago, has<br />\ncalled out his football men.

Van Lannep, Dutch viceconsul at Smyrna, and have been<br />\ntaken to England.<br />\nThe 'instruments show a type of<br />\nworkmanship unequaled in any<br />\nother specimens extant and generally reveal the very great progress in surgery which the ancients<br />\nhad made.<br />\nTheir date, though somewhat uncertain, was probably the first or<br />\nsecond century A. D. It is possible, however, that it may have<br />\nbeen before the Christian era.<br />\nWith two exceptions, all the instruments are of bronze.

The<br />\nweak point of his highly polished<br />\noration was a marked exaggeration in his frequent similies and<br />\nmetaphors. He advanced, as his<br />\nview of the needs of the movement<br />\nfor universal peace, a ,highly developed international conference, a<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 3, col. 2)<br /><br />\ncompetent international court with<br />\nsupreme power in all cases of international disputes, and an unprejudiced court of inquiry, to<br />\nthrash out every possible difference<br />\namong the powers.<br />\nJoyce delivered his winning speech<br />\nnext, and his strong, straightforward sentences, with just enough<br />\nof comparisons and illustrations to<br />\nmake them clear, made evident his<br />\nskill in presenting complex ideas<br />\nin a clear manner. In discussing<br />\nthe \"Reasonableness of Peace,\" he<br />\nbased his argument on the comparison of the rules of justice and<br />\nmethods of settling disputes among<br />\nindividuals with the methods employed among nations. He pictured<br />\nwar as a bad means, no matter how<br />\njustifiable the end, with the single<br />\nexception of cases of self-defence.<br />\nThe Hopkins man, Moses Baroway, spoke next.

During the<br />\nscholastic year of 1913-14, the student body has been composed of<br />\n267 undergraduates, distributed as<br />\nfollows: candidates for the degree<br />\nof bachelor of arts, 17o; engineering department, 74, and special students, 12. Of these, 121 men have<br />\ncome out for the four major sports<br />\nrecognized by the Athletic Association. Last 'fall the football team<br />\nattracted 29 men, while at present<br />\nthe lacrosse squad consists of 30<br />\nundergraduates,the baseball team of<br />\n22, and the track and field aggregation of the comparatively large<br />\nnumber of 40 men. This makes a<br />\ntotal of 121 out of 217 students<br />\nwho at one time or another this<br />\nyear have come out for athletics,<br />\nor an average of about 50 per cent.<br />\nof the entire undergraduate body.<br />\nThese figures leave out of account<br />\nthose who are out for the tennis<br />\nteam, as well as medical men and<br />\ngraduate students. These statistics<br />\nlead us to make the safe assumption that Hopkins easily leads all<br />\nother colleges in the percentage of<br />\nundergraduates indulging in officially recognized forms of sport..<br />\nThis may be attributed to the small<br />\nsize of the Hopkins student body,<br />\nbut the fact remains that the undergraduates of this University are,<br />\non the whole, loyal and brim full<br />\nof \"college spirit.\" Alumni and<br />\nstudents fail to take these things<br />\ninto, consideration when discussing<br />\nHopkins athletics. It is the policy<br />\nof the Athletic Association to utilize, as far as possible, only undergraduates, as may be proved from<br />\nthe fact that there are only five<br />\nmedicos and graduates on the lacrosse squad and but three on the<br />\ntrack squad. Baseball claims the<br />\nlargest number of the advanced<br />\nstudents, with two graduates and<br />\nten medical men. When we remember that the undergraduate<br />\ndepartment is the smallest in point<br />\nof numbers of the three great<br />\nbranches of work at Hopkins, we<br />\nmay feel proud of the way athletics<br />\nare regarded here.<br />\nCollege Athletics.<br /><br />\nSome interesting data about college athletics have been given out<br />\nrecently by the Research Committee<br />\nof the National Collegiate Association. The conclusion to be drawn<br />\nfrom the majority of the figures<br />\nand facts given, is that only rarely<br />\ndoes the whole student body take<br />\npart in any kind of organized athletics, and that enormous sums are<br />\nspent to condition a very few men<br />\nto represent their colleges in various lines of sport.<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nOne thousand dollars lies in the<br />\ntreasury of the Class of 1917 at<br />\nHarvard.<br />\n* * *<br /><br />\nThe Pink Slips,<br />\nBoys!<br /><br />\nPhi Beta Kappa at Yale has recently elected 28 men from the<br />\nClass of 1915 to membership.<br />\n* *<br /><br />\nHow we like to<br />\nsee them!<br /><br />\nAn agricultural library, something which sounds rather enigmatical, has been founded at Illinois<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nThe Michigan Musical Clubs are<br />\nto make a six-thousand-mile tour<br />\nthrough the West, with Los Angeles<br />\nas their goal, during the spring.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nCoach Stagg of Chicago, has<br />\ncalled out his football men.
