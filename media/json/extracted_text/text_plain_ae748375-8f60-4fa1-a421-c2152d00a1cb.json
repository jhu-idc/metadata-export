In distribution, alumni will be given preference.<br />\nIt is planned to'issue season tickets<br />\nto all graduates of the University,<br />\nand to provide free tickets to others<br />\nWho apply to the Director of Athletics.

At the<br />\nsame time, the scope of intercollegiate activities was extended to cover<br />\nthirteen sports instead of six. There<br />\nmay be a further extension under the<br />\nnew plan.<br />\nThe resu ltls were eminently<br />\nsatisfactory. Eighty-five per cent of<br />\nstudents engaged in some sort of<br />\nathletic activity, instead of a chosen<br />\nhandful, and there was a lessened<br />\ntendency to emphasize the records of<br />\nthe individual team. But it was still<br />\nIncomplete. The final step is the removal of the gate-receipts and guarantees, which at times led to a temptation to schedule games which drew<br />\nlarge crowds with opponents which<br />\nhopelessly outclassed Hopkins, and<br />\nto accept games with larger teams<br />\nfor the sake of the fat guarantee, and<br />\nproviding the other team with a<br />\n\"breather.\" However, this has not<br />\nbeen done, and the temptation itself<br />\nIs now finally removed.<br />\nJust what effect this move will<br />\nhave on the rating of Hopkins teams<br />\nis not known. Under the other plan,<br />\nthe records have been poor on the surface, because Hopkins could play only<br />\nteams of comparable ability, and<br />\nchose its teams entirely from the<br />\nmaterial which naturally turned out.<br />\nHowever, assuming that the purpose<br />\nOf college athletics is to provide<br />\ntraining and physical development for<br />\nthe students, the plan was a success.<br />\nTo quote from the report, \"There is<br />\nreason to believe, however, that with<br />\nadequate training and instruction,<br />\nHopkins teams should be equal to<br />\nthose of other institutions comparable<br />\nin size.\"<br />\n<br />\nMorley Says Sherlock<br />\nHolmes Studied Here<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\nle<br />\n<br />\ne.<br />\nis<br />\n<br />\ner<br />\nre<br />\n<br />\n11 d-<br />\n<br />\nThe letter sent by the treasurer's<br />\noffice to the parents of those men lately troubled by that bureau has been<br />\nreleased for publication in the NEWSLETTER.

The University will issue,<br />\nWithout charge, cards of admission<br />\nto the athletic contests. In distribution, alumni will be given preference.<br />\nIt is planned to'issue season tickets<br />\nto all graduates of the University,<br />\nand to provide free tickets to others<br />\nWho apply to the Director of Athletics. The number of tickets distributed to non-alumni will be limited<br />\nonly by the size of facilities at the<br />\nHomewood Field and Gymnasium.<br />\nMove Continues Policy<br />\nThis move is a continuation of the<br />\npolicy adopted several years ago,<br />\nWhen the few existing athletic scholarships were abolished, athletics<br />\nbrought under the control of the University, and a strong program of intramural sports introduced. At the<br />\nsame time, the scope of intercollegiate activities was extended to cover<br />\nthirteen sports instead of six. There<br />\nmay be a further extension under the<br />\nnew plan.<br />\nThe resu ltls were eminently<br />\nsatisfactory. Eighty-five per cent of<br />\nstudents engaged in some sort of<br />\nathletic activity, instead of a chosen<br />\nhandful, and there was a lessened<br />\ntendency to emphasize the records of<br />\nthe individual team. But it was still<br />\nIncomplete. The final step is the removal of the gate-receipts and guarantees, which at times led to a temptation to schedule games which drew<br />\nlarge crowds with opponents which<br />\nhopelessly outclassed Hopkins, and<br />\nto accept games with larger teams<br />\nfor the sake of the fat guarantee, and<br />\nproviding the other team with a<br />\n\"breather.\" However, this has not<br />\nbeen done, and the temptation itself<br />\nIs now finally removed.<br />\nJust what effect this move will<br />\nhave on the rating of Hopkins teams<br />\nis not known. Under the other plan,<br />\nthe records have been poor on the surface, because Hopkins could play only<br />\nteams of comparable ability, and<br />\nchose its teams entirely from the<br />\nmaterial which naturally turned out.<br />\nHowever, assuming that the purpose<br />\nOf college athletics is to provide<br />\ntraining and physical development for<br />\nthe students, the plan was a success.<br />\nTo quote from the report, \"There is<br />\nreason to believe, however, that with<br />\nadequate training and instruction,<br />\nHopkins teams should be equal to<br />\nthose of other institutions comparable<br />\nin size.\"<br /><br />\nMorley Says Sherlock<br />\nHolmes Studied Here<br /><br />\n11<br />\nle<br /><br />\ne.<br />\nis<br /><br />\ner<br />\nre<br /><br />\n11 d-<br /><br />\nThe letter sent by the treasurer's<br />\noffice to the parents of those men lately troubled by that bureau has been<br />\nreleased for publication in the NEWSLETTER.
