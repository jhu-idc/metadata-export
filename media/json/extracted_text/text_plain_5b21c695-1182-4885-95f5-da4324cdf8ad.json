He then outlined the plans for<br />\nthe season, urging strict attention to<br />\npractice. Dr. Abercrombie then gave<br />\na little dissertation on the rules of<br />\nthe gymnasium training and hygiene.<br />\nCoach Chesney then outlined the plans<br />\nfor the season, laying special stress<br />\nupon the hard practice that would<br />\nhave to be done, owing to the short<br />\ntime that remained for practice. Following this he and Captain Frank, of<br />\nlast year's team, gave a few practical<br />\ndemonstrations of stick work and<br />\nbody checking. Oti; old veteran coach,<br />\n\"Big Bill\" Schmeisser, then wound<br />\nup the meeting with a good, heart-toheart talk on lacrosse. Charlie Meyer<br />\nand Harry Schmeisser, two of our<br />\nex-captains, were also present.

The meeting, called by a number of Baltimore citizens,<br />\nwas presided over by Mr. Theodore<br />\nMarburg, who gave a brief survey<br />\nof the development of International<br />\nArbitration, and of the results, tangible and intangible, which had been<br />\narrived at by the two Hague Conferences. The first speaker was Dr.<br />\nJames Brown Scott, Solicitor for the<br />\nDepartment of State and Professor of<br />\nInternational Law at the George<br />\nWashington University. During the<br />\npast two years Dr. Scott has lectured<br />\nat this university on international<br />\nlaw. He is the author of numerous<br />\nworks, the most recent as well as<br />\nimportant of which is \"The Hague<br />\nPeace Conferences of 1899 and 1907,\"<br />\npublished by the Johns Hopkins Press.<br />\nDr. Scott was the first advocate of<br />\nInternational Court of Arbitral Justice, and through his efforts the American delegates to the Second Hague<br />\nConference were instructed by Secretary of State Root to advocate the<br />\nadoption of such a tribunal. They<br />\nsucceeded in having adopted by the<br />\nconference a convention embodying<br />\ntheir proposal. His address was devoted to an exposition of the theory<br />\nof this court, the stage of advancement in the pacific settlement of international disputes which it typifies,<br />\nand the normal evolution which made<br />\nit possible.<br />\nHe emphasized, in the first place,<br />\n\"at war is simply self-redress. In<br />\nthe case of individuals self-redress,<br />\nthe first method of settling differences, gave way to arbitration by a disinterested bystander. Next there was<br />\na contract system, which developed<br />\ninto a panel of judges sanctioned by<br />\nthe State, to the decision of whom<br />\nthe litigants must submit. The magistrate came gradually to be preferred. Under the Roman law, therefore<br />\n\u2014and this is the basis of our modern<br />\ncivil code\u2014there were three stages:<br />\nr. Private litigation.<br />\n2. Submission to a magistrate selected from a panel.<br />\n3. Adjudication by a judicial systern sanctioned by the State.<br />\nIn international law, with nations<br />\nsubstituted for individuals, the evolution has been identical. The great<br />\ncourt of arbitration in the Middle<br />\nAges was the papal one at Rome.<br />\nThe efficiency of this was, of course,<br />\n<br />\nFifty<br />\n<br />\nSTASTISTICS<br />\nThe Senior Class in Psychology<br />\nholds its meetings on the third floor<br />\nof the biological laboratory. It is<br />\nfound by actual computation that each<br />\nmember of the class will be required<br />\ndrying the course to make forty-eight<br />\nround trips up and down the biological staircase. From the pavement to<br />\nthe third floor there are sixty-four<br />\nsteps, making a total of one hundred<br />\nand twenty-eight steps to be surmounted by each person while making a round trip to and from the<br />\nclassroom. Forty-eight such round<br />\ntrips will require the surmounting by<br />\nevery person of six thousand, one<br />\nhundred and forty-our steps, not taking into account extra trips.<br />\n<br />\nPri-e, 5 cents per copy.<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore, Md., January 10, 1910.<br />\nhampered by political motives, and<br />\nthe matters submitted to it were in<br />\nthe great majority of instances those<br />\ninvolving ecclesiastical affairs. Its<br />\naid was invoked, therefore, not very<br />\noften.<br />\nWhen the first Hague Conference<br />\nestablished, therefore, a permanent<br />\npanel from which judges could be<br />\nselected to settle disputes without<br />\ncausing the litigant nations to resort<br />\nto the arbitrament of the sword, a<br />\ngreat advance had been made. The<br />\nfoundation of the last and final stage<br />\nnamely the establishment of a Court<br />\nof Arbitral Justice, was laid by the<br />\nadoption of the American proposal.<br />\nThe International Court of Prize,<br />\nalso an American proposition which<br />\nwas adopted at The Hague, and is<br />\ndesigned to regulate the possession<br />\nof prizes taken at sea, has the disadvantage of presupposing war. It is<br />\nthe policy of the State Department,<br />\npromulgated by Secretary Knox, to<br />\nhave the International Court of Prize<br />\nact as the Court of Arbitral Justice,<br />\nA note to this effect has been sent<br />\nto each of the signatory powers, and<br />\nratifications of this proposal are to be<br />\ndeposited at The Hague before June,<br />\n30, 1910.<br />\n\"The matter of international arbitration as a substitute for war between \u2022 nations,\" concluded Dr. Scott,<br />\n\"has passed out of the cell of the<br />\ncloister, out of the hand of reformers, out of the mind of the dreamer,<br />\nand is now a question of practical<br />\npolitics. No longer have we the visionary proposals of Emanuel Kant,<br />\nHenry IV, and William Penn; but,<br />\ninstead, the definite, specific proposal<br />\nof the Secretary of State of a government not the least powerful, not<br />\nthe least respected. If the American<br />\nproposal for the coincidence of the<br />\nCour of Prize and the Court of Arbitral Justice is not ratified by the<br />\nPowers, at least it will be on the<br />\nprogram of the Third Hague Conference. It seems that the prayers of<br />\nthe righteous had been heard and the<br />\nstill, small voice of peace has been<br />\nheard above the voices of others.\"<br />\nThe second speaker was Congressman Richard Bartholdt of Missouri,<br />\nwho is president of the American<br />\nBranch of the International Parliamentary Union. He developed further the analogy between national and<br />\ninternational law, and after ridiculing<br />\nthe untenable position of those who<br />\nhold as their maxim \"If you want<br />\npeace, prepare for war,\" expressed<br />\nhis advocacy of and hope for a Supreme Court of Nations. He spoke<br />\nin part as follows:<br />\nContinued on page 4, Column<br />\n<br />\n2.<br />\n<br />\nCLASS MEETING, 1912<br />\nClass Numerals<br />\nAwarded \u2014<br />\nNominations For Hullabaloo.<br />\nThe sophomores held a meeting<br />\nlast Thursday, and the class numerals were awarded to the followinc,<br />\nmen for football: John S.

A desirable tract of land has<br />\nbeen secured at the southeast corner<br />\nof Roland and Belvedere Avenues,<br />\nabout thirty-four acres of which will<br />\nbe retained for the use of the school,<br />\nthe rest probably to be disposed of<br />\nfor building sites. About $74,000 has<br />\nalready been secured, and it is probable that sufficient funds will soon<br />\nbe forthcoming to allow removal to<br />\nmore suitable quarters. Certificates<br />\nof Indebtedness are now being circulated for the purpose of collecting the<br />\nremainder of the fund. It is only<br />\nnecessary to accumulate $26,000 in<br />\naddition to the money already subscribed in order for the school to<br />\nmove. It is therefore expected that<br />\n.the building at Homewood may be<br />\nvacated by the opening of the University next year.<br />\nIn front of the Carroll mansion,<br />\nwhich the University expects to keep<br />\nfor use when Hopkins moves to<br />\nHomewood, there is a stretch of land<br />\ndown to Charles street which will<br />\nprobably form the future campus.<br />\nDuring the summer and fall work<br />\nhas been carried on in grading this<br />\nland, though its condition is now an<br />\neyesore, owing to the work not being<br />\ncomplete.

No arrangement has<br />\nas yet been made for properly draining this land. It is thought by many<br />\nthat a slope gradually rising from the<br />\nstreet up to the half-circle of future<br />\nbuildings would be more attractive.<br />\nThe Carroll Mansion will form one<br />\nof the half-circle of buildings which<br />\nwill probably extend around the rim<br />\nof the bowl above referred to. It does<br />\nnot require an optimistic imagination<br />\nto picture with ease a university campus surrounded by stately buildings of<br />\nthe Colonial style, similar in architecture to the Carroll Mansion.<br />\nThe intended move of the Country School will be of interest to many<br />\nHopkins Alumni.

The first speaker was Dr.<br />\nJames Brown Scott, Solicitor for the<br />\nDepartment of State and Professor of<br />\nInternational Law at the George<br />\nWashington University. During the<br />\npast two years Dr. Scott has lectured<br />\nat this university on international<br />\nlaw.

The magistrate came gradually to be preferred. Under the Roman law, therefore<br />\n\u2014and this is the basis of our modern<br />\ncivil code\u2014there were three stages:<br />\nr.

A desirable tract of land has<br />\nbeen secured at the southeast corner<br />\nof Roland and Belvedere Avenues,<br />\nabout thirty-four acres of which will<br />\nbe retained for the use of the school,<br />\nthe rest probably to be disposed of<br />\nfor building sites. About $74,000 has<br />\nalready been secured, and it is probable that sufficient funds will soon<br />\nbe forthcoming to allow removal to<br />\nmore suitable quarters. Certificates<br />\nof Indebtedness are now being circulated for the purpose of collecting the<br />\nremainder of the fund. It is only<br />\nnecessary to accumulate $26,000 in<br />\naddition to the money already subscribed in order for the school to<br />\nmove.

It is thought by many<br />\nthat a slope gradually rising from the<br />\nstreet up to the half-circle of future<br />\nbuildings would be more attractive.<br />\nThe Carroll Mansion will form one<br />\nof the half-circle of buildings which<br />\nwill probably extend around the rim<br />\nof the bowl above referred to.
