Several calls<br />\nto the Housing Office brought<br />\na maintenance crew to clear the<br />\ndrain, but the sink clogged once<br />\nmore soon after.

Election Commission regulations<br />\nstate that no candidate may<br />\nplace ads in any campus publication. The ads for Freed,<br />\nstated, however, that they were<br />\npaid- for the \"Committee for<br />\nGood Hopkins Government\"<br />\nand the \"Friends of Maureen<br />\nFreed.\" Yesterday, Freed said<br />\nthat Edward Lasseigne, a fresh-<br />\n<br />\nman who works on her campaign, had agreed to pay for the<br />\nads. In Robbins' view, this<br />\nmeant that the ads were not<br />\nplaced by the candidate and<br />\nshould have been allowed.<br />\nElections Commission Chairman Bruce Polkes, however,<br />\nsaid that this made no difference. Wednesday afternoon,<br />\nwhen the News-Letter had<br />\nreceived the ads but had not yet<br />\nagreed to run them, Polkes said<br />\nthat if the ads ran, Freed would<br />\nprobably be disqualified from.<br />\nthe election. When Freed learned this, she withdrew the ads.<br />\nThe ads were brought to the<br />\nNews-Letter by Lasseigne.

Therefore,<br />\nKarras called other Elections<br />\ncommissioners. Craig Kliger<br />\nand Steve Troy, both commissioners, said the ads would<br />\nviolate commission regulations.<br />\nRobbins, however, said that<br />\nsince the ads were technically<br />\nnot paid for by Freed, they<br />\nshould be allowed to run. When<br />\nPolkes was finally reached, he<br />\nagreed with Kliger and Troy.<br />\nSince three people constitute a<br />\nmajority of the Elections Commision, Freed would almost<br />\nassuredly have been disqualified if the ads had run.<br />\nHowever, Karras was concerned that federal law would<br />\ncompel him to publish the ads<br />\nanyway.<br />\nKarras' concern grew out of<br />\na 1970 ruling from the Seventh<br />\nCircuit Court which said that a<br />\ncollege newspaper which accepts paid commercial advertising may not reject other paid<br />\nadvertising because it is editorial in nature.<br />\nPolkes was able to reach<br />\nFreed and Lasseigne, and they<br />\nasked Karras to not print the<br />\nads.<br />\nFreed said that when Lasseigne first attempted to place<br />\nthe ads, she had no knowledge<br />\nthat this violated Elections<br />\nCommission regulations.<br />\n<br />\nResults of the March 8, 1983 Primary Election<br />\nfor Student Council Executive Officers:<br />\nTotal Voting: 757 (Approximately 32 percent<br />\nof the Student Body)<br />\nPresident<br />\nDouglas Fellman - Run-off 329<br />\n121<br />\nEric Fink<br />\nMaureen Freed - Run-off 265<br />\n9<br />\nWrite-ins<br />\n<br />\n724<br />\nTotal Votes<br />\nNeeded to Win 363<br />\n<br />\nVice President<br />\n- Winner 389<br />\n239<br />\n21<br />\n<br />\n649<br />\nTotal Votes<br />\nNeeded to Win 326<br />\n<br />\n205<br />\n- Winner 418<br />\n16<br />\n<br />\nTotal Votes<br />\n639<br />\nNeeded to Win 321<br />\n<br />\nGregg Weinstock - Winner 381<br />\n91<br />\nWrite-ins<br />\n<br />\nTotal Votes<br />\n472<br />\nNeeded to Win 237<br />\n<br />\nDolores Bulled<br />\nJim Keim<br />\nWrite-ins<br />\nTreasurer<br />\nRobert Basow<br />\nHarry Davis<br />\nWrite-ins<br />\nSecretary<br />\n<br />\nSocial Director<br />\nJohn Drago<br />\nShawn Messick<br />\nWrite-ins<br />\n<br />\n191<br />\n- Winner 361<br />\n49<br />\n<br />\nTotal Votes<br />\n601<br />\nNeeded to Win 302<br />\n<br />\nThe following Young Trustee candidates<br />\nhave advanced to next Tuesday's ballot.<br />\nTom Neuberger<br />\nBruce Polkes<br />\nJosh Reiter<br />\nHolly Robbins<br />\n<br />\nChris Hampton<br />\nDanny Kao<br />\nGinger Killian<br />\nBrian Mirsky<br />\n<br />\n1983/1984 * HOUSING LOTTERY<br />\nCONTRACT SIGNING SESSION<br />\nDORM SOCIAL LOUNGE<br />\nWednesday March 16<br />\n7:00 P.M. 8:30 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nGraduate Single Unit<br />\n<br />\nWednesday, March 16<br />\n8:30 P.M. 10:00 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nUndergraduate Single Unit<br />\nUndergraduate Single Space<br />\n<br />\nThursday, March 17<br />\n<br />\nGraduate 2 Person Space<br />\nGraduate 3 Person Space<br />\n<br />\n7:00 P.M. 8:30 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nThursday, March 17<br />\n8:30 P.M. 10:00 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nGraduate Single Space<br />\n<br />\nUndergraduate 2 Person Space<br />\nUndergraduate 3 Person Space<br />\n<br />\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, CONTACT THE HOUSING OFFICE<br />\n<br />\n338-7960<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 3<br />\n<br />\nHays Speaks On Importance Of<br />\nBureaucracies In Policy-making<br />\nBY EILEEN FITZGERALD<br />\n<br />\nHistorians have generally ignored the importance of the<br />\nrole played by bureaucracies in<br />\npolitical administration, especially in those areas concerned with environmental policy,<br />\naccording to Dr. Samuel P.<br />\nHays, Harmsworth Professor<br />\nof American History at Oxford<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nHays delivered the first of<br />\nthree James Schouler Lectures<br />\npresented by the Department of<br />\nHistory dealing with bureaucracies and federal policies in<br />\nthe years since World War II.<br />\nHe addressed interested students and faculty on \"The<br />\nPolitics of Environmental Administration\" on Monday in<br />\nthe Listening and Viewing<br />\nRoom.<br />\nHays briefly outlined the<br />\nhistory of environmental policy<br />\nin the U.S. prior to World War<br />\nII.

Thomas, proposed this week<br />\nthat Americans of 18 years of age be compelled to spend one year performing national<br />\nservice. While the idea is not a new one, its<br />\nrecent attention indicates that serious consideration of such a plan may not be too far<br />\nin the future.<br />\nAccording to the plan proposed by Koch,<br />\nboth men and women reaching the age of 18<br />\nwould be given the choice of'spending a year<br />\nperforming military or civilian service. The<br />\npeople who selected civilian service could<br />\nwork on environmental problems, as<br />\nteacher's aides, as tutors, or caring for the<br />\nelderly and sick. The rationale underlying<br />\ncivilian service is that it would benefit society<br />\nas well as American youth. The tasks performed could be targeted at major national<br />\nproblems. It would provide young adults<br />\nwith a meaningful role in society after high<br />\nschool and instill in them a sense of purpose.<br />\n<br />\nformal schooling for students wishing to pursue a post-secondary education. A third objection to the Koch proposal is that in the<br />\nabsence of a natural motivation, 18-year-olds<br />\nwill not perform their tasks competently.<br />\nA similar, but superior national youth service plan was offered several years ago by<br />\nJohns Hopkins University President Steven<br />\nMuller. Muller emphasized that the program<br />\nshould be voluntary with compelling incentives. He suggested that the plan provide<br />\nguaranteed job training and substantial<br />\nfederal assistance toward post-secondary<br />\neducation. Replacing current methods of obtaining federal financial aid, students would<br />\nearn their assistance through voluntary service. Only those who performed national service would recieve aid.<br />\nAt first glance, the idea of national youth<br />\nservice may seem radical, possibly abhorrent,<br />\nto America's young. However, the potential<br />\nbenefits of such a plan are likely to encourage a growing interest in the idea. Its implementation would greatly change AmeriIt is likely, however, that any serious pro- can society and our educational system. The<br />\nposal of this nature will meet with stiff Ford Foundation recently approved a<br />\nresistance among America's youth. The most $259,000 grant for a study of various models<br />\nrepulsive aspect is compulsion. Many will for such a program. If nothing else, the idea<br />\nequate the program with \"forced labor.\" of national youth service merits further inFurthermore, it will interrupt the pattern of vestigation, consideration and debate.<br />\n<br />\nSave The SAC Seals<br />\nEach year the SAC awards honorary seals<br />\nto graduating seniors who have performed<br />\ndistinguished service to the student body.<br />\nWhile the list often resembles a who's who<br />\nof senior class officers, SAC Executive<br />\nBoard members and Student Council<br />\nleaders, this year's choices are unusually<br />\ngood. The SAC Executive Board's lengthy<br />\ndeliberations produced 21 recommendations.<br />\nThey made a sincere effort to give awards<br />\non the basis of effort, achievement and intent, rather than by title. As a result, some<br />\nundergraduates generally unpopular with<br />\nstudent leaders received seals.<br />\nNot all undergraduates are content with<br />\nthe SAC's choices. Some students who did<br />\nnot receive awards have complained that<br />\nthey deserve them. It is entirely possible that<br />\nthe SAC Executive Board neglected some<br />\n<br />\nworthy student or that some of the 21 choices<br />\nwere questionable. It is impossible to avoid<br />\nsome inequity. On the whole the list is extremely reasonable. Those who complain<br />\nthat they were unjustly by-passed are committing an ignoble act.<br />\nIn the real world, an SAC seal means very<br />\n<br />\nlittle. It will not help anyone get a job. It is<br />\nmerely a nice gesture of respect for graduating seniors who have worked hard to help<br />\ntheir fellow students. An undergraduate truly<br />\ndedicated to student service will not care<br />\nwhether or not he is awarded a seal. The<br />\nmotives of the complainers are therefore<br />\nsuspect. Unless the entire process of distributing seals is abolished, the News-Letter<br />\nbelieves that seniors crying over lost seals<br />\nshould be ignored and that the present list<br />\nshould remain intact.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nsomehow undermine deterrence.

Accordingly,<br />\nit disappeared from my transcript. Upon receiving my fall<br />\ngrades, however, I was shocked to discover that the instructor had never altered his roster,<br />\nand that I had received an Incomplete. Once again, I had<br />\nthis removed from my transcript.<br />\nLast week, I went to get a<br />\ncopy of my transcript to send to<br />\na grad school, and was horrified to discover that the Incomplete had been replaced by<br />\na \"D.\" At first, the thought of<br />\nthe \"D\" scared the hell out of<br />\nme. But then, something even<br />\nmore unbelievable crossed my<br />\nmind. It seems that I had passed a Hopkins course without<br />\never having to attend. Since I<br />\ndropped the course before it<br />\neven started, I should have<br />\nreceived an \"F.\"<br />\nNow don't get me wrong, I<br />\nthink that there ought to be<br />\nsome courses that are easier<br />\nthan others; indeed, that is inevitable. But under no circumstances ought it be possible<br />\nto pass a course without ever<br />\ntaking it. The registrar explained that the professor or TA<br />\nprobably just wanted to be a<br />\nnice guy\u2014an admirable sentiment. Even so, such things<br />\nmake a mockery of the system.<br />\n<br />\nIt seems to me very stupid to<br />\ndebate the virtues of different<br />\ngrading systems when the disparity between the courses<br />\nthemselves make such distinctions ludicrous, as well as inapplicable. Why don't the policymakers at this University sit<br />\ndown and set minimum standards of achievement for individual courses? It does not<br />\nseem unreasonable to insist that<br />\na student must complete the<br />\ncoursework in order to pass. At<br />\nleast then, the distinctions<br />\nseemingly so crucial to the people who adopted plus/minus<br />\ngrading would have some<br />\nmeaning. As things stand now,<br />\nthe whole system is a farce.<br />\nDavid Hurwitz<br />\n<br />\nCampaign Posters<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs a member of the student<br />\nbody, I am once again confronted by a seemingly unending flow of campaign posters<br />\nand leaflets.

ROY<br />\nIn this piece, Robert Roy<br />\nrecalls the experiences of the<br />\n1928 Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nOlympic team.<br />\nFifty-five years ago,come<br />\nJuly 11, 18 lacrosse players,<br />\ntwo coaches and their wives,<br />\none manager and two<br />\nnewsmen sailed from New<br />\nYork on the S.S. President<br />\nRoosevelt, bound for<br />\nAmsterdam and the ninth<br />\nOlympic Games.<br />\nWe were lucky to be there.<br />\nWe had lost to Army and<br />\nNavy but had beaten<br />\nMaryland in the last game of<br />\nthe regular season and,<br />\nperhaps on this account, had<br />\nbeen included in a six-team<br />\nplayoff. We won over<br />\npreviously undefeated Mt.<br />\nWashington in the first<br />\nround (a game interrupted<br />\nby a cloudburst and<br />\nhailstorm), beat Army in the<br />\nsemifinal and again beat<br />\nMaryland, winner over<br />\nRutgers and Navy, in the<br />\nfinal.<br />\nNone of us will ever forget<br />\nthe voyage. The passenger<br />\nlist could be given in three<br />\nwords: American Olympic<br />\nTeam. There were runners,<br />\nboxers, swimmers, divers,<br />\nwrestlers, fencers, rowers,<br />\nhigh jumpers, cyclists,<br />\nequestrians, hurdlers and<br />\ngymnasts performing on<br />\nmats, springboards, a swimming<br />\npool,<br />\nrowing<br />\nmachines, parallel bars or a<br />\nrunning track laid round the<br />\ndeck. Our coach, Ray Van<br />\nOrman, had us run laps, and<br />\nthe four right-angle turns<br />\nwere hell on the calf of the<br />\noutboard leg. Marathon<br />\nrunners would run 30<br />\nminutes in one direction and<br />\nthen go the other way, talking all the while. Boxing,<br />\nwrestling and fencing involved actual matches and and<br />\nwere favorite spectator<br />\nsports\u2014much better than<br />\nwatching<br />\nJohnny<br />\nWeissmuller, not yet Tarzan,<br />\nswim against a restraining<br />\nrope.<br />\nThere were girls, too, and<br />\na few shipboard romances.<br />\nAdelaide Lambert, who won<br />\na gold medal swimming in<br />\nthe 400-meter relay, was<br />\nkeen on Gard Mallonee, and<br />\nGeorgia<br />\nColeman, a<br />\nvivacious and curly blonde<br />\ndiver, fell hard for Bill<br />\nLogan. I got no farther than<br />\nholding hands with Albina<br />\nOsipowich on the foredeck<br />\nin rough weather. Albina<br />\nhad won the 100-meter<br />\nfreestyle and was a cute girl,<br />\nbut all of these romances last<br />\nonly as long as the<br />\nhomeward voyage.<br />\nTrack and field in the<br />\nOlympic Stadium were spectacular. Our runners were<br />\n<br />\nfavored but did badly. Betty Robinson won the<br />\n100 meter for women, but<br />\nthe only man to win a flat<br />\nrace was Ray Barbuti, who<br />\ndove headlong to win the<br />\n400 meter. Clarence Hauser,<br />\nwho, with other field men,<br />\nhad watched us practice,<br />\nmuffed two discus throws,<br />\nbut on his last chance set a<br />\nnew Olympic record. Paavo<br />\nNurmi and Willie Ritola of<br />\nFinland and Edwin Wide of<br />\nSweden lapped everyone else<br />\nin the 10,000 meter; Nurmi<br />\nbroke the world record by 18<br />\nseconds\u2014and then picked<br />\nup his sweat clothes and ran<br />\nthe length of the field to the<br />\ndressing room.<br />\nWe were -in our dressing<br />\nroom waiting l'or the<br />\nmarathon to finish when<br />\nthey carried in Joie Ray, the<br />\nChicago cab driver who was<br />\nthe first American to finish,<br />\nin fifth place.

We won 6-3 but on the<br />\nfollowing day lost to<br />\nEngland 7-6. Two things<br />\nstick in my memory: An<br />\nEnglish attack man on a solo<br />\nclear came racitig in, tried to<br />\ndodge and lost the ball,<br />\nwhereupon a teammate<br />\nshouted, \"I say, toss it about<br />\na bit, Percival Craig!\"<br />\nWorse than that, we were<br />\ndenied a last-minute tying<br />\ngoal when the goal umpire<br />\nruled that Bill Logan was in<br />\nthe crease. The irony of this<br />\nwas our insistence as a team<br />\nthat there be a crease\u2014not<br />\nwanted by either Canada or<br />\nEngland.<br />\nCanada, having enjoyed a<br />\nday of rest, beat England on<br />\nthe final day 9-5, causing a<br />\ntriple-tie.<br />\nMost of us went down to<br />\nparis on the \"Etoile du<br />\nNord\" and did the kinds of<br />\nthings people do there: the<br />\nOpera, the.

Shock is the major killer<br />\nof multiple-injury victims. Described as \"a momentary pause in the act of dying,\" shock essentially involves cell suffocation. With a sluggish or failed circulation to the tissues and vital organs, death often<br />\nfollows.<br />\nDespite the critical nature of the problems associated<br />\nwith shock, little was known, until about 20 years ago,<br />\nabout what changes were occurring in a victim suffering from shock, or how to correct those changes. Thus,<br />\nCowley took up the task, which continues to this day.<br />\nHe discovered that during shock the body engages in<br />\na fierce struggle for survival at the cellular level, where<br />\nshock upsets the delicate balance of the defense network that destroys infection-causing bacteria. Shock<br />\nalso destroys the fragile checks and balances of the<br />\nblood's chemistry.<br />\nBY EDMUND MEADE<br />\n<br />\ndie. In contrast to the inefficient, often deadly techniques for determining brain swelling that have long been<br />\npresent in medicine, the Shock Trauma doctors<br />\nmonitor intracranial pressure in brain trauma patients<br />\nby inserting a slim tube directly through the skull. This<br />\nunorthodox procedure involves the use of a wound<br />\nhole or the deliberate drilling of a hole for this purpose.<br />\nThe use of dialysis, or artificial cleansing of the<br />\nblood, for many trauma patients, who are not suffer\u2014<br />\ning from kidney disease, was pioneered at Shock<br />\nTrauma. When a patient is in trauma, the kidneys,<br />\neven if not damaged, cannot cope with the large<br />\namounts of wastes that are put into the blood as a<br />\nresult of the body's efforts to handle the shock trauma.<br />\nStudies show positively that this simple, and yet controversial, method significantly reduces the death rate<br />\nfrom kidney failure.<br />\nWhile the lack of oxygen in lung tissue is a serious<br />\nproblem, the lack of oxygen in other tissues of the<br />\nbody can lead to the development of gas gangrene\u2014a<br />\nlife-threatening infection. The organism which causes<br />\ngas gangrene cannot live under high concentrations of<br />\noxygen. Thus, the idea of using a hyperbaric (increased<br />\npressure) oxygen chamber was incorporated in the<br />\nbattle against this infection. This chamber has also<br />\nproved successful in treating victims of the bends,<br />\nsmoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning.<br />\nIn the research aimed at finding other ways to solve<br />\ncommon problems faced by the victims of shock<br />\ntrauma, the scientists at MIEMSS found a way of<br />\npreventing the rupturing of aortas. The consequence<br />\nof a ruptured aorta is nearly always death. It is<br />\ntherefore necessary to promptly diagnose the slightest<br />\ntear in the aorta. To detect this situation, Shock<br />\nTrauma doctors developed the painful, but accurate<br />\nsit-up X-ray method. In this way it became possible<br />\nto determine if the patient's aorta was about to rupture. Thus, once again the death rate associated with<br />\nthis common debilitation was lowered.<br />\nPehaps, none of these different medical techniques<br />\nwould be possible without the use of computers and<br />\nother instruments. Computers at Shock Trauma<br />\nalready monitor the heart, lungs and metabolic functions of the patients, make individual calculations of<br />\ndrug doses, acquire the results from different labs, and<br />\nextrapolate how the patient will recover.<br />\n\"In the not-too-distant future,\" Cowley says, \"we'll<br />\nbe able to bring a patient in and within minutes get<br />\nall the data we need without cutting into the patient<br />\nor injecting things. The same computer will give us a<br />\ncookbook recipe for therapy with less than a tenthof-one-percent failure rate.\"<br />\nCowley clearly does not see emergency rooms in<br />\nregular hospitals as substitutes for centers such as<br />\nShock Trauma. He says, \"Severe trauma is an unchecked killer that cannot be controlled in traditional<br />\nemergency rooms.\" He adds, \"The non-system we<br />\nhave of treatment these injured patients is grossly inadequate.\" As Cowley sees it, trauma centers are the<br />\nonly way to help the critically injured. As he says,<br />\n\"Hospitals aren't geared for trauma victims, becaUse<br />\nthey interfere with a hospital's daily operation. Most<br />\nhospitals close at three o'clock in the afternoon.

A person<br />\nwho is suffering from trauma has at most an hour.<br />\n\"At Shock Trauma, we treat accident victims as if they<br />\nhad standing appointments,\" Dr. Cowley explained.<br />\nDiagnosis and treatment of each individual occur<br />\nso swiftly in the first couple of hours that procedures<br />\noften appear less rehearsed than they actually are.<br />\n<br />\nR.

With Shock Trauma<br />\nand MIEMSS coordinating trauma care throughout<br />\nthe state of Maryland, training and certifying<br />\nparamedics, training physicians in advanced trauma<br />\nlife support, and many other functions, the role of<br />\nthese institutions is critical.<br />\nSince Shock Trauma treats only about 1,000 seriously<br />\ninjured patients in Maryland, the state-wide support<br />\nsystem of MIEMSS is also important. Maryland is<br />\ndivided into five emergency medical services regions,<br />\n<br />\neach of which has an area trauma center.

Serflin<br />\ng<br />\nsays that in his department, all faculty members,<br />\nnot<br />\njust those on the committee, may inspect applica<br />\nnts'<br />\nfiles.<br />\nThe cut is then made. In the Psychology<br />\nDepartment, three pools are made. The first is people<br />\n\"completely out of the question,\" second, \"not<br />\nthe committee's choice,\" and third, \"acceptable.\" In this<br />\nlast<br />\ncategory, the first 10 are ranked.<br />\nSpecial consideration to minorities and women<br />\nis<br />\noften the case. Dr. William Garvey, Chairman<br />\nof the<br />\nDepartment of Psychology, stated that his depart<br />\nment<br />\ngives them special consideration. Wolman says that<br />\nif<br />\neverything else is equal, a woman or minority will<br />\nbe<br />\nchosen. Green advertises in Women in Engineering.<br />\nGreen, however, \"doesn't remember having<br />\nany<br />\nwomen applicants.\" Green, who has been at Hopkin<br />\ns<br />\nfor 20 years, finds this hard to believe, for his<br />\ndepartment has \"more woman grad students than we've<br />\never<br />\nhad ...most applicants in engineering are foreign<br />\nnationals...most grad students are foreign nationals,\"<br />\nbut the latter is \"not true in my department.\"<br />\nThe committee invites select people to come for an<br />\ninterview. Usually, between three and seven people are<br />\ninvited. \"The fewer the better,\" says Wolman. By this<br />\ntime the letters of recommendation are received. Letters are only required from the final candidates.<br />\nTravel plans may determine the order of interviews.<br />\nGarvey says that \"a lot of effort goes to meet these<br />\npeople, with limited funds allotted for travel.\" The<br />\napplicant's file and labels it \"complete\" or \"incom- candid<br />\nate is given a description of the department and<br />\nplete.\" For all departments, the committee goes over<br />\nfaculty. Each candidate visits Hopkins, speaks with<br />\nall applications. There may be hundreds for a single<br />\nfaculty members, is taken to lunch and dinner, and<br />\nposition, as was the case in the Psychology Depart- attends<br />\nsocial functions.

For one recent opening in chairman of the Depart<br />\nment Of Physics.<br />\n<br />\nBesides teaching ability, researCh plans and -ability<br />\nas a scientist, personality is also important. The<br />\nperson must fit in with the department. Green wants<br />\nsomeone who will be content at a small, \"relatively<br />\npoorly equipped\" school. \"An introvert won't work<br />\nwell here,\" says Green. Fisher wants someone with<br />\nwhom one \"can form a large intellectual connection.\"<br />\nThe decision is made. If no one is selected, the<br />\nsearch will begin again the next fall. Usually, of course,<br />\nsomeone is selected. The applicant is contacted.

The dean is<br />\nnotified, and the salary is determined. Often members<br />\nof the department will help their new colleague find<br />\nhousing.<br />\n\"Academic mills grind slowly,\" says Dr. Moos.<br />\nMoos also says that years ago, everything was done<br />\nby personal contact. Wolman, citing the fact that now<br />\nmany professionals are married to other professionals<br />\nand must be accommodated, says that the process \"is<br />\nmuch more complicated than it was several years ago.\"<br />\n<br />\nINTERVIEWS WILL BE HELD<br />\nFOR THE POSITIONS OF CHAIRMEN<br />\n<br />\nof<br />\nStudent Council Film Series<br />\nUnion Board<br />\nConcert Committee<br />\nSpeaker Committee<br />\nElections Commission<br />\nFine Arts Committee<br />\nFrom Monday, March 14 to Thursday, March 18<br />\nSign Up At The Student Council Office<br />\nQuestions?<br />\nCall Danny Kao at 338-8203 or 366-2835<br />\n<br />\n\fDresses,Dressers At Discount<br />\nselection of clothes of any of the stores<br />\nin the area. The prices are also the<br />\nlowest. Half of the large store is devoted<br />\nto clothes, and they aren't as crowded<br />\ntogether as they are at some stores. At<br />\nthe Salvation Army, the clothes are easily accessible and there are fairly wide<br />\naisles between the long racks of clothing.<br />\nEverything is sorted out and labeled, so<br />\nthings are easy to find. As at Goodwill,<br />\nthe Salvation Army has standardized<br />\nprices. Men's and women's pants are<br />\n$1-2; sweaters and vests are $1.25; shirts<br />\nand blouses $1.25; skirts $1.25; ladies'<br />\nsuits $3-6; men's complete suits $15-20;<br />\nwomen's blazers $1.50 and up; and belts<br />\n$.25. Because the Salvation Army has<br />\nso many more clothes than the area's<br />\nother thrift stores, it is easier to find<br />\nthings there. Wool skirts and sweaters<br />\nare always available as well as good<br />\nsuits, dresses and shirts. One drawback<br />\nhere, however, is the lack of a dressing<br />\nroom.<br />\nBefore going shopping for clothes at<br />\nthrift stores, one should measure the<br />\nwaists and lengths of skirts, pants and<br />\nother clothes he or she currently wears.<br />\nThen the tape measure should be taken<br />\nalong so that clothes at the stores can<br />\nbe sized. To aid shoppers, Goodwill<br />\nwrites the waist sizes of pants and skirts<br />\non the price tags. It is important to be<br />\nsure that the clothes you are buying fit,<br />\nbecause they can't be returned. Clothes<br />\nshould also be examined closely for<br />\nholes, rips and the like. All the stores<br />\ncovered here say that their clothes are<br />\ncleaned before being put out for sale.<br />\nBoth the Goodwill stores and the<br />\nSalvation Army store have furniture for<br />\n<br />\nBY BECKY BJORNSON<br />\nWithin half-an -hour's walking<br />\ndistance of campus are several thrift<br />\nstores where you can find almost anything you might be looking for at extremely low prices.

A wide range of merchandise<br />\nis available at these stores such as<br />\nclothing, dishes and furniture.<br />\nA Goodwill Industries brochure describes the Waverly store as \"the place<br />\nto go t'or name-label clothing,\" and one<br />\nof the main features of the store is the<br />\nlarge selection of clothes including a lot<br />\nof brand-name things. The Hampden<br />\nstore doesn't have as many clothes, but<br />\nit has more shoes, pajamas and underclothes. While there may seem to be<br />\nquite a bit of out-dated \"tacky\" clothes,<br />\nthere are also many good-quality items<br />\nto be found. Wool and even cashmere<br />\nsweaters in perfect condition are mixed<br />\nwith other sweaters and vests with missing buttons and torn sleeves. The key to<br />\nlooking at clothes here, or at any other<br />\nthirft store, is to look at every single<br />\nthing.<br />\nShirts and blouses (both men's and<br />\nwomen's) are $1.89; pants (men's and<br />\nwomen's) are $1.89; vests and sweaters<br />\nare $2.79; jeans are $3.69 and up;<br />\nblazers and jackets are $4.59; men's<br />\ncomplete suits start at $10 and women's<br />\nare $5.49; nightgowns and pajamas are<br />\n51-2; dresses are priced from $2.79 to<br />\n$3.69; and skirts are $2.79. Winter coats<br />\nand clothes are currently marked down<br />\nat both stores, and the Waverly store has<br />\njust started getting spring clothes. Both<br />\nGoodwill stores have frequent markdowns and sales of their clothes. The<br />\nWaverly store almost always has several<br />\ntables or racks of clothes at especially<br />\nlow prices. Both the stores have private<br />\ndressing rooms.<br />\nThe Salvation Army has the largest<br />\n<br />\nsale. The furniture sold is fairly basic:<br />\ndesks, dressers, tables, chairs and sofas.<br />\nOf the three stores, Salvation Army has<br />\nthe most for sale. Right now they have<br />\nquite a few dressers and desks priced<br />\nfrom $25-40; armchairs from 519.50-22.50;<br />\nsofas and recliners at $39 on up; and end<br />\ntables for $8-12. Bed and mattress sets<br />\nare also sold. The Hampden Goodwill<br />\nhas more and somewhat better furniture<br />\nthan the Waverly store. Several dinette<br />\nsets, dressers ($25-35), desks ($30), and<br />\nend tables are all available at Hampden.<br />\nThe Waverly store has some chests,<br />\ndesks and cabinets, but they are generally higher priced and not in as good con-<br />\n<br />\ndition as the furniture sold at Hampden'.<br />\nBoth Hampden and Waverly stores sell<br />\nheadboards and new mattresses. Currently Hampden has some very nice<br />\nsofas, armchairs and recliners at extremely low prices.<br />\nMany pieces of furniture at the stores<br />\nhave several coats of paint on them and<br />\nso may not look very good, but only a<br />\nlittle work, i.e., stripping, repainting or<br />\nstaining, would be needed to improve<br />\ntheir appearance.<br />\nPlates, glasses, bowls, utensils, pots<br />\nand pans, ice cube trays and other kitchen equipment are sold at all three area<br />\nstores. The prices are about the same<br />\neverywhere, however, Goodwill and<br />\nsome smaller stores have frequent<br />\nmarkdowns and sales. The Goodwills<br />\nalso sell small electrical appliances.<br />\nDishes and more practical kitchen supplies usually sell rapidly, so one should<br />\nshop the stores fairly often for such<br />\nitems.<br />\nIn addition to clothes, furniture and<br />\nkitchen goods, the thrift stores have<br />\nmany other things available. These include cameras, luggage, costume jewelry, lamps, televisions and loose buttons.<br />\nBooks, magazines and records are sold<br />\nfor very low prices. Also sold are several<br />\nhousehold items which most people need<br />\nat one time or another but don't really<br />\nthink of shopping around for. These<br />\nsimple items include curtain rods and<br />\nhooks, shower hooks, toilet seat covers<br />\nand greeting cards. The Goodwills are<br />\ncurrently selling new blankets and<br />\nbedspreads for $7-10.<br />\nBehind the Rite-Aid drugstore on<br />\n32nd and Greenmount is a small thrift<br />\n<br />\nshop operated by the Metropolitan<br />\nCommunity Church of Baltimore.<br />\nClothes here are priced at almost<br />\nnothing, but most of them are very worn<br />\nand old -looking. Some dishes, paintings, books, records and shoes are also<br />\nsold, but the store is too small to have<br />\nmuch of anything. Frequent trips there<br />\nare suggested as the turnover rate of<br />\nmerchandise is usually high.<br />\nFrequent trips to the other thrift<br />\nshops on Greenmount, including Hester's Thrift Shop, The Last Straw and<br />\nThe Curiosity Shop, are also suggested.<br />\nThese are relatively small and contain<br />\nfairly standard thrift-shop material. The<br />\nLast Straw and The Curiosity Shop are<br />\n<br />\neatures<br />\n<br />\n\fDens<br />\nalso consignment and gift shops, hence<br />\na little fancier and more specialized than<br />\nthe other area stores.<br />\nThrift stores should be checked out<br />\nevery few weeks or so, because although<br />\nthe selection of some things may stay<br />\nbasically the same, other items are continually sold and brought in, creating<br />\nconstant variety in what each store offers. Thrift stores are convenient and<br />\nvery inexpensive places to shop, something everybody should use to their<br />\nadvantage.<br />\n<br />\n.2ii.c.yling Abroad<br />\n<br />\nIn Deutschland, Discos Didn't Die<br />\nBY MICHAEL SEGAL<br />\nThe News-Letter, in dire need of<br />\nsomething to fill up space so that they<br />\nwon't have to interview Sophie Beagle<br />\non the election, asked me if I'd like to<br />\nmake some observations on my semester<br />\nin Germany \"to help students realize<br />\ntheir full range of options.\" A truly<br />\ncomprehensive list would have to include the following:<br />\n0-The beer really is as good as they<br />\nsay it is.<br />\nlf you only know German from old<br />\nmovies and Hogan's Heroes, you're<br />\nprobably better off keeping your mouth<br />\nshut for the first week or so, because<br />\nwhen you try to get people's attention<br />\nby barking \"Achtung\" at them they just<br />\nlook at you like you're crazy.<br />\nThe students are more left wing<br />\nthere than they are here. It's very common to see what we would call leftover<br />\nhippies walking down the street,<br />\nespecially in university towns.<br />\n0-Almost everybody is very, very<br />\nsorry about the war and wish the whole<br />\nthing hadn't happened, except for a few<br />\npeople who run Bavaria.<br />\nIGerman bathrooms are kept very<br />\nclean, much cleaner than the Italian or<br />\nFrench, but the toilets have a grotesque<br />\nand anti-social design. (For a detailed<br />\ndescription, see Fear of Flying by Erica<br />\n.long: the section entitled, \"A Tour of<br />\nEurope by Toilet.\")<br />\nActually my observations might be<br />\nsomewhat distorted by the part of Germany in which I stayed. I was in<br />\nFreiberg, a relatively small city whose<br />\ntwo major functions are a large university and a brewery. Actually, the two are<br />\nsomewhat related. Freiberg is in the<br />\nformer Kingdom of Baden-Wirtenberg<br />\nin the southwest corner of the Federal<br />\nRepublic, a half-hour by train from<br />\nBasel, Switzerland, and a twenty-minute<br />\ndrive from Colmar, France (ten minutes<br />\nit' a German is driving).<br />\nThe Swiss Alps peter out well south<br />\nof this area, but it is very hilly. Freiberg<br />\nis situated right in the Black Forest; in<br />\nfact, the forest juts into the center of<br />\ntown. A large hill stands next to one of'<br />\nthe two remaining city gates from the<br />\ndays when Freiberg was walled. The hill<br />\nwas fortified as recently as World War<br />\nI, but now its major function is as a starting point for hiking trails that begin near<br />\nthe fortress walls. The view from up<br />\nthere, which had for centuries been used as a primitive form of aerial reconnaissance overlooking the valley, is now<br />\npresided over by a small state of<br />\nDionysus or some other god of wine<br />\nwho protects the vineyards below him.<br />\nHis bunch of grapes and his penis had<br />\nbeen spray painted bright red, but I<br />\nnever could find out it' this was part of<br />\nthe tradition or not.<br />\n<br />\nFreiberg has no suburbs. Small farms<br />\nand vineyards begin very quickly as you<br />\nleave the city, and every day, long<br />\nbefore I would wake up, farmers would<br />\nbring their vegetables and flowers to the<br />\nold town square, the Munsterplatz. The<br />\nsquare was rebuilt after being bombed<br />\nout in the war, so it still looks as it had<br />\nfor hundreds of years. The Gothic<br />\ncathedral in the center was somehow untouched, and the farmers' market goes<br />\non all around this building, especially on<br />\nWednesdays and Saturdays. These are<br />\nthe traditional farmers, whose plots of<br />\nland are too small to modernize and<br />\noften on land that is too hilly for cash<br />\nfarming. They work much as generations of icrinan ?al ink..rs ha% ,\u2018 worked<br />\nraising radishes, potatoes and other<br />\nvegetables to sell in town, and keeping<br />\ncows.<br />\nThe students who dominate the other<br />\nhalt' of town come from all over Germany as well as other nations, and they<br />\nbelong to a different century from the<br />\n<br />\nfarmers. There are bars catering to<br />\nstudents all over town, usually located<br />\nin cellars under shops. Many of these<br />\nplaces are mini-discos or even, God help<br />\nus, full-size ones. Some have got to be<br />\nGreen Party headquarters. Many contain a sizeable collection of hippies with<br />\n<br />\nmembers of the punk movement, far<br />\nmore visible than ii is in Ilaltlinthe. (It's<br />\nbeen moving overseas ever since the Rat<br />\n(fisconiinued punk nights.)<br />\nThe '60s-style leftists are a presence<br />\nin Germany, and it' they are not a large<br />\nproportion of the population (they're<br />\nprobably at most 5.6 percent), they are<br />\ncertainly not pariahs, at least not among<br />\nthe students. It's hard to tell as an outsider if they have influence beyond their<br />\nnumbers, or if a very small number of<br />\npeople is producing enormous amounts<br />\nof graffiti.<br />\nThere are two programs in Freiberg<br />\nthat are available t'or Hopkins students,<br />\nboth of which are run by the Institute<br />\nof European Studies in Chicago. One is<br />\nfor German speakers, and gives students<br />\na chance to take courses at the university as well as some German courses at<br />\nIES, which is a little easier on people<br />\nwho need to ask what a word means<br />\nevery once in a while.<br />\nThere's also an English-speaking program which concentrates on the European Economic Community, the cornmon market. The courses have a tendency to overlap, and they don't involve a<br />\nlot of depth, but the program gives a<br />\nsolid background in current European<br />\n\u2022 politics.<br />\nPart of the program includes ten days<br />\nof traveling. The German speakers go<br />\nto Berlin. The EEC does one of those<br />\nwhirlwind \"If it's Tuesday, this must be<br />\nBelgium tours of several Northern<br />\nEuropean cities which are the seats of<br />\nthe different international organizations.<br />\nThe tour also goes to Amsterdam for<br />\nreasons that transcend mere academic<br />\nutility.<br />\nIn general, the programs offer a good<br />\nchance to live and play in a town that<br />\nnot many tourists see, where Americans<br />\nare still scarce enough so you get neither<br />\nthe tourist traps nor the hostility that<br />\ncan come from being too close to a major landmark or an Army base.

It's as good a blanket<br />\nstatement as any for what's wrong with<br />\nthis movie.<br />\nThe setting is Jakarta, Indonesia,<br />\n1965. Australian journalist Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson)arrives during the last<br />\ndays of the Sukarno regime to cover the<br />\npower struggles between the government, the military, and two primary insurrectionist factions, the Moslems and<br />\nthe Communists. He is befriended by<br />\nBilly Kwan (Linda Hunt), a ChineseAustralian photographer whose desire<br />\nto control the lives of the people he cares<br />\nabout far outstrips his dwarfish stature.<br />\nAs the two send reports and pictures<br />\nback to Sydney, Hamilton is gradually<br />\nintroduced to the social and political injustices that have drawn Billy to become<br />\na sort of diminutive champion of the oppressed. \"What then must we do?\" is poverty, mysticism (an elaborate<br />\nKwan's mantra about the poor, echoing metaphor comparing Billy, Guy and Jill<br />\nTolstoy and St. Luke before him; his to the principal puppets in a Japanese<br />\ntheory is that one should do all in his shadow-play is one of the chief elements<br />\npower to help those nearest him, a doc- of the early part of the film), journalistic<br />\ntrine he tries to instill in Guy, whose ethics, and the fate of love and altruism<br />\nnature is more of the go-getting, under a dictatorship, it doesn't deal<br />\nsatisfactorily with any of them.

For instance, the puppet<br />\nmetaphor is dropped once Guy and Jill<br />\nare together; the film then traces their<br />\nrelationship and Billy's growing dissatisfaction with Sukarno's inhumane<br />\npolicies on two separate tracks, to the<br />\npoint that Billy's suicidal act of<br />\ndissidence, and the reasons for it, barely register on the two people he is most<br />\nattached to.<br />\nEven the military coup seems incidental in this morass of screenplay elements.<br />\nIt happens almost entirely offscreen,<br />\nwith the result that the viewer unfamiliar<br />\nwith the historical background of the<br />\nfilm is uncertain of exactly who is<br />\nfighting whom.<br />\nThe love story, too, leads eventually<br />\nnowhere.

We're as deep as we've ever<br />\nbeen defensively. If we can put the chemistry together<br />\nwe'll have a nice squad to work with. This team will<br />\nbe able to compete with anybody.\"<br />\nComing off a 11-3 1982 season, including a 7-5<br />\nNCAA Division I Championship Game loss to North<br />\nCarolina, second-ranked Hopkins will open the 1983<br />\nlacrosse season tomorrow when they host UMBC at<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\n1982 Lacrosse Rankings<br />\nNCAA Division I<br />\nNo.<br />\n1 .<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nSchool<br />\nNorth Carolina<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nVirginia<br />\nCornell<br />\nArmy<br />\nAdelphi<br />\nMaryland<br />\nNavy<br />\n<br />\nRecord<br />\n14-0<br />\n11-3<br />\n10-3<br />\n11-2<br />\n10-4<br />\n10-5<br />\n10-5<br />\n6-5<br />\n<br />\nSince Ciccarone took the head coaching reins from<br />\nBob Scott in 1975, the Jays have compiled a 93-14<br />\nrecord. The taxers have'appeared in the last six national championship games. After winning three successive titles in 1978, 1979 and 1980, Hopkins lost to<br />\nNorth Carolina in both the 1981 and 1982 championships. This year the Jays will be trying to regain the<br />\nnumber-one spot from a team that has won 26 consecutive games over the last two seasons.<br />\nThe Blue Jays lost eight players to graduation last<br />\nyear. In addition to losing two-time first-team AllAmerican attackman Jeff Cook and second-team AllAmerican defenseman Dave Black, Hopkins will be<br />\nwithout the services of attackmen Mike Donnelly,<br />\nCraig Cook and Kyle Hicks, and midfielders Joe Ciletti,<br />\nJeff Kendall and Brian Huntley. With the exception<br />\nof Black, the entire 1982 defense is returning, as are<br />\ngoalies Brian Holman and Larry Quinn.<br />\nMeanwhile, North Carolina has an unprecedented<br />\nfive first-team All-Americans returning to their starting lineup. They include last season's Player of t'<br />\nYear Tom Sears (goalie), Mike Burnett (attackman),<br />\nPeter Voelkel (middle), Jeff Homiere (middle) and<br />\nJohn Haus (defender<br />\n<br />\n\"We have more weapons than in the past. Our offense is more balanced,\" Cantelli explained. \"Last<br />\nyear our offense was easier to defend\u2014they'd concentrate on Jeff. This year everyone's a threat.\"<br />\nIn the midfield, Hopkins is strong. The key midfielders include three All-Americans: Bill Cantelli,<br />\nJohn Krumenacker and Henry Ciccarone, Jr.; Del<br />\nDressel, a transfer from Harvard and a \"real asset\"<br />\naccording to Coach Cicearone; and senior Kirk<br />\nBaugher. Ciccarone intends to make use of his midfield depth this year by running the midfielders more<br />\nand looking for fast breaks.<br />\n\"Defensively we're in a 'position to do some things<br />\nthat we haven't been able to do before because of the<br />\npersonnel,\" noted Ciccarole. Senior Marty Bergin will<br />\nanchor the defense. He wiI1 be assisted by seniors Jim<br />\nEsposito and Haswell Frariklin, juniors Walt Carswell<br />\nand Steve Dubin, sophothore Guy Matricciani and<br />\nfreshman John DeTommaSo. Also, Frank DeVita and<br />\nBrian Baumgardner will he used frequently. \"Our<br />\ndefense is real solid,\" said Ciccarone.<br />\nWhile the Jay goalies are not in the same class as<br />\nNorth Carolina's Tom Sears, they are close. \"I<br />\nthought last year in the Championship game Brian<br />\nHolman played just as well as Sears,\" commented Ciccarone. \"Sears was definitely more consistent. He had<br />\na great season and was named Player of the Year.\"<br />\nSenior Brian Holman will start in goal, but he will have<br />\nto share his playing time with sophomore Larry Quinn.<br />\n\"I'm not hesitant to play both goalies this year,\" Ciccarone said.<br />\n<br />\nRob Lord shoots under pressure.<br />\n<br />\nA major factor in the Blue Jay performance this<br />\nseason could very well be the addition of Don Zimmerman to the coaching staff. Zimmerman, a former<br />\nAll-American lacrosse player at Hopkins, spent the last<br />\nfour years as an assistant to Willie Scroggs at North<br />\nCarolina. Ciccarone calls the addition of Zimmerman<br />\na gain for Hopkins as well as a loss for North Carolina.<br />\n\"Needless to say, Don's addition to our staff has made<br />\na big difference,\" explained Ciccarone. \"It's a great<br />\nhelp for me to have somebody like Don here as a fulltime member of our staff.\" Zimmerman, who will run<br />\nthe Jay offense, is looking forward to his first season<br />\non the Hopkins staff. \"With hard work and a good<br />\nattitude,\" he said, \"I think we can go all the way.\"<br />\nThe Jays will be looking to take advantage of their<br />\nmidfield and defensive depth this season. According<br />\nto Ciccarone, the Jays will press the ball hard and<br />\nrotate players in and out in order to keep fresh laxers<br />\nin at all times. \"We'll be able to give opponents different looks on defense throughout the game,\" he<br />\ncommented. Hopkins will be looking to fast break and<br />\nscore off the transition game. \"We're going to push<br />\nthe ball upfield more, as opposed to settling it down,\"<br />\n1933 captain Bill Cantelli<br />\nnoted Cantelli.<br />\nAllreturning<br />\nfive<br />\nhas<br />\nCarolina<br />\nNorth<br />\nAlthough<br />\nAmericans,\"We've got five too,\" reminded Hopkins<br />\n1982 NCAA Division I First Team All-Americans<br />\ncaptain Bill Cantelli.

The junior was<br />\nthe top scorer on the 1982 Jays with 35 goals. \"Last<br />\nseason Pete was a good scorer,\" said Coach Ciccarone,<br />\n\"but this year we expect him to balance out. He'll probably get more assists.\" Scott is an excellent dodger<br />\nand also a strong rider on clears. Noting Scott's allaround ability, offensive coach Don Zimmerman<br />\nhopes that Scott will be the \"the quarterback of the<br />\nteam.\"<br />\n<br />\nRob Lord<br />\n419 Attack<br />\nSenior<br />\n5'9\", 160<br />\nWestminster, Md.<br />\n\"We're counting on Rob to come into his own this<br />\nyear,\" said Coach Ciccarone. Last year, while playing in spots, Lord scored eight goals to go with four<br />\nassists. Rob is also an excellent feeder, as well as a<br />\ngood player without the ball. According to captain Bill<br />\nCantelli,\"Rob is a good broken-field-type player, who<br />\nexcells in the unsettled situation.\" Lord should fit in<br />\nwell with the new, more wide-open offensive philosophy.<br />\n<br />\nGary Benninghoff<br />\n423 Attack<br />\nSenior<br />\n6'4\", 210<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nBenninghoff got off to an excellent start in 1982,<br />\nthough he was slowed by injuries late in the season.<br />\nStill, his 19 goals were third best on the team. Besides<br />\nlacrosse, Benninghoff played soccer and basketball for<br />\nHopkins. Speaking about Benninghoff, captain Bill<br />\nCarnal said, \"He's excellent on the crease. His size<br />\nmakes him a good screener, and his 'basketball instincts' help him in lacrosse, especially with setting<br />\npicks.\" Coach Ciccarone expects a big year from<br />\nBenninghoff.<br />\n<br />\nWilly Odenthal<br />\n48 Attack<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'0\", 180<br />\nHuntington, N.Y.<br />\n<br />\n..<br />\nill<br />\n<br />\nLast year Odenthal was a middie, but in order to<br />\nget some depth on attack, Coach Ciccarone switched<br />\nhim to attack. \"Willy played attack in high school,\"<br />\nsaid Ciccarone. \"He's a very capable dodger and<br />\nshould see much action.\"<br />\n<br />\nBrent Ciccarone<br />\n#11 Attack<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'0\", 170<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nThe younger of the coach's two sons on the squad,<br />\nBrent Ciccarone is an excellent rider as well as a strong<br />\noffensive player. Says his father, \"Brent is probably<br />\nthe best screener on the team.\"<br />\n<br />\nMike Lynch<br />\n#30 Midfield<br />\nSenior<br />\n5'11\", 170<br />\nMassapequa, N.Y.<br />\n\"One of the smartest midfielders we've ever had\"<br />\nis the way Ciccarone described this senior. While a leg<br />\ninjury has slowed Lynch in the past, leadership and<br />\nsteady play is expected from him this season. Cantelli<br />\nfeels that while Lynch may not have the physical ability<br />\nof some of the other players, \"he is always in the right<br />\nplace at the right time to make the big play.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 17<br />\nBill Cantelli<br />\n#7 Midfield<br />\nSenior<br />\n5'8\", 160<br />\nValley Stream, N.Y.<br />\n<br />\nRich Glancy<br />\n#9 Midfield<br />\nJunior<br />\n5'9\", 175<br />\nMaplewood, N.J.<br />\n<br />\nGuy Matricciani<br />\n#28 Defense<br />\nSophomore<br />\n5'9\", 170 Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nAn honorable-mention All-American last season,<br />\nsenior Cantelli has been named captain of the Jays.<br />\nTermed \"a fine all-around player\" by Ciccarone,<br />\nCantelli should provide the team with leadership.<br />\nCoach Zimmerman feels that Cantelli's style of play<br />\nshould fit in well with the 1983 Blue Jays: \"He plays<br />\nboth offense and defense well, and we're stressing<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nInterestingly, Cantelli feels that the captain is most<br />\nimportant not on game day, but during practice. \"A<br />\ncaptain is not only a leader, but also a motivator. We<br />\npractice five days a week, and it's tough to get the<br />\nplayers up for practice every day. It's my job to get<br />\neveryone mentally prepared for practice. By Saturday,<br />\nthough, either you're ready or you're not.\"<br />\nYet, if necessary, Cantelli will take charge on game<br />\nday. \"As captain, if someone needs a talking to, I'll<br />\ndo it,\" he said. \"And a captain has to take things into his own hands. This will probably put more pressure<br />\non me.\"<br />\n<br />\nGlancy was in the midst of a fine season a year ago<br />\nuntil torn ligaments sidelined him for the final games.<br />\nNow recovdre_d from his injury, he should see a lot of<br />\nplaying time at midfield and also help with the faceoffs.<br />\nAn excellent ground-ball man, he had 43 last year. Glancy is also a good defensive middie. Bill Cantelli calls<br />\nRich \"an important player.\"<br />\n<br />\nMatricciani had an outstanding freshman year. He<br />\nled the defense in ground balls with 57 and Ciccarone<br />\ncalls him \"one of the best ground-ball defensemen I've<br />\never seen. Guy may also be used as a defensive middie,<br />\nas he's fast and an excellent stick handler.-<br />\n<br />\nDel Dressel<br />\n#4 Midfield<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'2\", 170<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nJohn Krumenacker<br />\n#32 Midfield<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'3\", 175<br />\nFarmingdale, N.Y.<br />\nWith 16 goals and 11 assists as a freshman,<br />\nKrumenacker was named third-team All-American last<br />\nyear. He had a superb season. Ciccarone described<br />\nKrumenacker as \"the most poised freshman we've ever<br />\nhad.\" Coach Zimmerman went even further, saying<br />\nKrumenacker \"played as well as any freshman I've<br />\never seen.\" Zimmerman also called Krumenacker a<br />\nvery dedicated player. Even with all the success of his<br />\nfirst season, Coach Ciccarone expects the sophomore<br />\nto be better this year.<br />\n<br />\nA.1 r<br />\n<br />\n\"Unlimited talent\" is Zimmerman's assessment of<br />\nDel Dressel's potential. A transfer from Harvard,<br />\nDressel had to sit out his freshman season. Dressel is<br />\nconsidered an all-around threat, good on ground balls,<br />\noffense and defense.<br />\nBill Cantelli feels that while Dressel has shown a lot<br />\nof ability, he is still short on game experience. \"Del's<br />\nlooked good so far, but he's still learning the system.<br />\nHe's like a freshman as far as strategy,\" noted the<br />\ncaptain.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1 if 41**AL V-41 -IL<br />\n1 \u202241.4.<br />\n41.******************* 4.<br />\n<br />\n!BLUE<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\nSteve Dubin<br />\n#37 Defense<br />\nJunior<br />\n5'9\", 170<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nJAY<br />\n<br />\nGreg Matthews<br />\n#12 Midfield<br />\nSophomore<br />\n5'9\", 175<br />\nFranklin Square, N.Y.<br />\nOne of a pair of excellent sophomore faceoff men<br />\nfor the Blue Jays.

The ads for Freed,<br />\nstated, however, that they were<br />\npaid- for the \"Committee for<br />\nGood Hopkins Government\"<br />\nand the \"Friends of Maureen<br />\nFreed.\" Yesterday, Freed said<br />\nthat Edward Lasseigne, a fresh-<br /><br />\nman who works on her campaign, had agreed to pay for the<br />\nads.

Wednesday afternoon,<br />\nwhen the News-Letter had<br />\nreceived the ads but had not yet<br />\nagreed to run them, Polkes said<br />\nthat if the ads ran, Freed would<br />\nprobably be disqualified from.<br />\nthe election.

Thomas, proposed this week<br />\nthat Americans of 18 years of age be compelled to spend one year performing national<br />\nservice. While the idea is not a new one, its<br />\nrecent attention indicates that serious consideration of such a plan may not be too far<br />\nin the future.<br />\nAccording to the plan proposed by Koch,<br />\nboth men and women reaching the age of 18<br />\nwould be given the choice of'spending a year<br />\nperforming military or civilian service. The<br />\npeople who selected civilian service could<br />\nwork on environmental problems, as<br />\nteacher's aides, as tutors, or caring for the<br />\nelderly and sick. The rationale underlying<br />\ncivilian service is that it would benefit society<br />\nas well as American youth. The tasks performed could be targeted at major national<br />\nproblems. It would provide young adults<br />\nwith a meaningful role in society after high<br />\nschool and instill in them a sense of purpose.<br /><br />\nformal schooling for students wishing to pursue a post-secondary education. A third objection to the Koch proposal is that in the<br />\nabsence of a natural motivation, 18-year-olds<br />\nwill not perform their tasks competently.<br />\nA similar, but superior national youth service plan was offered several years ago by<br />\nJohns Hopkins University President Steven<br />\nMuller. Muller emphasized that the program<br />\nshould be voluntary with compelling incentives. He suggested that the plan provide<br />\nguaranteed job training and substantial<br />\nfederal assistance toward post-secondary<br />\neducation. Replacing current methods of obtaining federal financial aid, students would<br />\nearn their assistance through voluntary service. Only those who performed national service would recieve aid.<br />\nAt first glance, the idea of national youth<br />\nservice may seem radical, possibly abhorrent,<br />\nto America's young. However, the potential<br />\nbenefits of such a plan are likely to encourage a growing interest in the idea. Its implementation would greatly change AmeriIt is likely, however, that any serious pro- can society and our educational system. The<br />\nposal of this nature will meet with stiff Ford Foundation recently approved a<br />\nresistance among America's youth. The most $259,000 grant for a study of various models<br />\nrepulsive aspect is compulsion. Many will for such a program. If nothing else, the idea<br />\nequate the program with \"forced labor.\" of national youth service merits further inFurthermore, it will interrupt the pattern of vestigation, consideration and debate.<br /><br />\nSave The SAC Seals<br />\nEach year the SAC awards honorary seals<br />\nto graduating seniors who have performed<br />\ndistinguished service to the student body.<br />\nWhile the list often resembles a who's who<br />\nof senior class officers, SAC Executive<br />\nBoard members and Student Council<br />\nleaders, this year's choices are unusually<br />\ngood. The SAC Executive Board's lengthy<br />\ndeliberations produced 21 recommendations.<br />\nThey made a sincere effort to give awards<br />\non the basis of effort, achievement and intent, rather than by title. As a result, some<br />\nundergraduates generally unpopular with<br />\nstudent leaders received seals.<br />\nNot all undergraduates are content with<br />\nthe SAC's choices. Some students who did<br />\nnot receive awards have complained that<br />\nthey deserve them. It is entirely possible that<br />\nthe SAC Executive Board neglected some<br /><br />\nworthy student or that some of the 21 choices<br />\nwere questionable. It is impossible to avoid<br />\nsome inequity. On the whole the list is extremely reasonable. Those who complain<br />\nthat they were unjustly by-passed are committing an ignoble act.<br />\nIn the real world, an SAC seal means very<br /><br />\nlittle. It will not help anyone get a job. It is<br />\nmerely a nice gesture of respect for graduating seniors who have worked hard to help<br />\ntheir fellow students. An undergraduate truly<br />\ndedicated to student service will not care<br />\nwhether or not he is awarded a seal. The<br />\nmotives of the complainers are therefore<br />\nsuspect. Unless the entire process of distributing seals is abolished, the News-Letter<br />\nbelieves that seniors crying over lost seals<br />\nshould be ignored and that the present list<br />\nshould remain intact.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nsomehow undermine deterrence.

Accordingly,<br />\nit disappeared from my transcript. Upon receiving my fall<br />\ngrades, however, I was shocked to discover that the instructor had never altered his roster,<br />\nand that I had received an Incomplete. Once again, I had<br />\nthis removed from my transcript.<br />\nLast week, I went to get a<br />\ncopy of my transcript to send to<br />\na grad school, and was horrified to discover that the Incomplete had been replaced by<br />\na \"D.\" At first, the thought of<br />\nthe \"D\" scared the hell out of<br />\nme. But then, something even<br />\nmore unbelievable crossed my<br />\nmind. It seems that I had passed a Hopkins course without<br />\never having to attend. Since I<br />\ndropped the course before it<br />\neven started, I should have<br />\nreceived an \"F.\"<br />\nNow don't get me wrong, I<br />\nthink that there ought to be<br />\nsome courses that are easier<br />\nthan others; indeed, that is inevitable. But under no circumstances ought it be possible<br />\nto pass a course without ever<br />\ntaking it. The registrar explained that the professor or TA<br />\nprobably just wanted to be a<br />\nnice guy\u2014an admirable sentiment. Even so, such things<br />\nmake a mockery of the system.<br /><br />\nIt seems to me very stupid to<br />\ndebate the virtues of different<br />\ngrading systems when the disparity between the courses<br />\nthemselves make such distinctions ludicrous, as well as inapplicable. Why don't the policymakers at this University sit<br />\ndown and set minimum standards of achievement for individual courses? It does not<br />\nseem unreasonable to insist that<br />\na student must complete the<br />\ncoursework in order to pass. At<br />\nleast then, the distinctions<br />\nseemingly so crucial to the people who adopted plus/minus<br />\ngrading would have some<br />\nmeaning. As things stand now,<br />\nthe whole system is a farce.<br />\nDavid Hurwitz<br /><br />\nCampaign Posters<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs a member of the student<br />\nbody, I am once again confronted by a seemingly unending flow of campaign posters<br />\nand leaflets.

ROY<br />\nIn this piece, Robert Roy<br />\nrecalls the experiences of the<br />\n1928 Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nOlympic team.<br />\nFifty-five years ago,come<br />\nJuly 11, 18 lacrosse players,<br />\ntwo coaches and their wives,<br />\none manager and two<br />\nnewsmen sailed from New<br />\nYork on the S.S. President<br />\nRoosevelt, bound for<br />\nAmsterdam and the ninth<br />\nOlympic Games.<br />\nWe were lucky to be there.<br />\nWe had lost to Army and<br />\nNavy but had beaten<br />\nMaryland in the last game of<br />\nthe regular season and,<br />\nperhaps on this account, had<br />\nbeen included in a six-team<br />\nplayoff. We won over<br />\npreviously undefeated Mt.<br />\nWashington in the first<br />\nround (a game interrupted<br />\nby a cloudburst and<br />\nhailstorm), beat Army in the<br />\nsemifinal and again beat<br />\nMaryland, winner over<br />\nRutgers and Navy, in the<br />\nfinal.<br />\nNone of us will ever forget<br />\nthe voyage. The passenger<br />\nlist could be given in three<br />\nwords: American Olympic<br />\nTeam. There were runners,<br />\nboxers, swimmers, divers,<br />\nwrestlers, fencers, rowers,<br />\nhigh jumpers, cyclists,<br />\nequestrians, hurdlers and<br />\ngymnasts performing on<br />\nmats, springboards, a swimming<br />\npool,<br />\nrowing<br />\nmachines, parallel bars or a<br />\nrunning track laid round the<br />\ndeck. Our coach, Ray Van<br />\nOrman, had us run laps, and<br />\nthe four right-angle turns<br />\nwere hell on the calf of the<br />\noutboard leg. Marathon<br />\nrunners would run 30<br />\nminutes in one direction and<br />\nthen go the other way, talking all the while. Boxing,<br />\nwrestling and fencing involved actual matches and and<br />\nwere favorite spectator<br />\nsports\u2014much better than<br />\nwatching<br />\nJohnny<br />\nWeissmuller, not yet Tarzan,<br />\nswim against a restraining<br />\nrope.<br />\nThere were girls, too, and<br />\na few shipboard romances.<br />\nAdelaide Lambert, who won<br />\na gold medal swimming in<br />\nthe 400-meter relay, was<br />\nkeen on Gard Mallonee, and<br />\nGeorgia<br />\nColeman, a<br />\nvivacious and curly blonde<br />\ndiver, fell hard for Bill<br />\nLogan. I got no farther than<br />\nholding hands with Albina<br />\nOsipowich on the foredeck<br />\nin rough weather. Albina<br />\nhad won the 100-meter<br />\nfreestyle and was a cute girl,<br />\nbut all of these romances last<br />\nonly as long as the<br />\nhomeward voyage.<br />\nTrack and field in the<br />\nOlympic Stadium were spectacular. Our runners were<br /><br />\nfavored but did badly. Betty Robinson won the<br />\n100 meter for women, but<br />\nthe only man to win a flat<br />\nrace was Ray Barbuti, who<br />\ndove headlong to win the<br />\n400 meter. Clarence Hauser,<br />\nwho, with other field men,<br />\nhad watched us practice,<br />\nmuffed two discus throws,<br />\nbut on his last chance set a<br />\nnew Olympic record. Paavo<br />\nNurmi and Willie Ritola of<br />\nFinland and Edwin Wide of<br />\nSweden lapped everyone else<br />\nin the 10,000 meter; Nurmi<br />\nbroke the world record by 18<br />\nseconds\u2014and then picked<br />\nup his sweat clothes and ran<br />\nthe length of the field to the<br />\ndressing room.<br />\nWe were -in our dressing<br />\nroom waiting l'or the<br />\nmarathon to finish when<br />\nthey carried in Joie Ray, the<br />\nChicago cab driver who was<br />\nthe first American to finish,<br />\nin fifth place. He was in a<br />\nstate of collapse and they<br />\nhad to cut the shoes from his<br />\nswollen feet.<br />\nWe were there between the<br />\nhalves of our first game<br />\nagainst Canada and resumed play when the marathon,<br />\nexcept for stragglers, was<br />\nover. We won 6-3 but on the<br />\nfollowing day lost to<br />\nEngland 7-6. Two things<br />\nstick in my memory: An<br />\nEnglish attack man on a solo<br />\nclear came racitig in, tried to<br />\ndodge and lost the ball,<br />\nwhereupon a teammate<br />\nshouted, \"I say, toss it about<br />\na bit, Percival Craig!\"<br />\nWorse than that, we were<br />\ndenied a last-minute tying<br />\ngoal when the goal umpire<br />\nruled that Bill Logan was in<br />\nthe crease. The irony of this<br />\nwas our insistence as a team<br />\nthat there be a crease\u2014not<br />\nwanted by either Canada or<br />\nEngland.<br />\nCanada, having enjoyed a<br />\nday of rest, beat England on<br />\nthe final day 9-5, causing a<br />\ntriple-tie.<br />\nMost of us went down to<br />\nparis on the \"Etoile du<br />\nNord\" and did the kinds of<br />\nthings people do there: the<br />\nOpera, the. Louvre, the<br />\nFolies Bergere, Moulin<br />\nRouge and Casino de Paris,<br />\nnot necessarily in that order.<br />\nWith Lou Nixdorff and Bill<br />\nKegan, I stayed in a pension<br />\non the Sein at 37 Quay de St.<br />\nAugustin.

Shock is the major killer<br />\nof multiple-injury victims. Described as \"a momentary pause in the act of dying,\" shock essentially involves cell suffocation. With a sluggish or failed circulation to the tissues and vital organs, death often<br />\nfollows.<br />\nDespite the critical nature of the problems associated<br />\nwith shock, little was known, until about 20 years ago,<br />\nabout what changes were occurring in a victim suffering from shock, or how to correct those changes. Thus,<br />\nCowley took up the task, which continues to this day.<br />\nHe discovered that during shock the body engages in<br />\na fierce struggle for survival at the cellular level, where<br />\nshock upsets the delicate balance of the defense network that destroys infection-causing bacteria. Shock<br />\nalso destroys the fragile checks and balances of the<br />\nblood's chemistry.<br />\nBY EDMUND MEADE<br /><br />\ndie. In contrast to the inefficient, often deadly techniques for determining brain swelling that have long been<br />\npresent in medicine, the Shock Trauma doctors<br />\nmonitor intracranial pressure in brain trauma patients<br />\nby inserting a slim tube directly through the skull. This<br />\nunorthodox procedure involves the use of a wound<br />\nhole or the deliberate drilling of a hole for this purpose.<br />\nThe use of dialysis, or artificial cleansing of the<br />\nblood, for many trauma patients, who are not suffer\u2014<br />\ning from kidney disease, was pioneered at Shock<br />\nTrauma. When a patient is in trauma, the kidneys,<br />\neven if not damaged, cannot cope with the large<br />\namounts of wastes that are put into the blood as a<br />\nresult of the body's efforts to handle the shock trauma.<br />\nStudies show positively that this simple, and yet controversial, method significantly reduces the death rate<br />\nfrom kidney failure.<br />\nWhile the lack of oxygen in lung tissue is a serious<br />\nproblem, the lack of oxygen in other tissues of the<br />\nbody can lead to the development of gas gangrene\u2014a<br />\nlife-threatening infection. The organism which causes<br />\ngas gangrene cannot live under high concentrations of<br />\noxygen. Thus, the idea of using a hyperbaric (increased<br />\npressure) oxygen chamber was incorporated in the<br />\nbattle against this infection. This chamber has also<br />\nproved successful in treating victims of the bends,<br />\nsmoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning.<br />\nIn the research aimed at finding other ways to solve<br />\ncommon problems faced by the victims of shock<br />\ntrauma, the scientists at MIEMSS found a way of<br />\npreventing the rupturing of aortas. The consequence<br />\nof a ruptured aorta is nearly always death. It is<br />\ntherefore necessary to promptly diagnose the slightest<br />\ntear in the aorta. To detect this situation, Shock<br />\nTrauma doctors developed the painful, but accurate<br />\nsit-up X-ray method. In this way it became possible<br />\nto determine if the patient's aorta was about to rupture. Thus, once again the death rate associated with<br />\nthis common debilitation was lowered.<br />\nPehaps, none of these different medical techniques<br />\nwould be possible without the use of computers and<br />\nother instruments. Computers at Shock Trauma<br />\nalready monitor the heart, lungs and metabolic functions of the patients, make individual calculations of<br />\ndrug doses, acquire the results from different labs, and<br />\nextrapolate how the patient will recover.<br />\n\"In the not-too-distant future,\" Cowley says, \"we'll<br />\nbe able to bring a patient in and within minutes get<br />\nall the data we need without cutting into the patient<br />\nor injecting things. The same computer will give us a<br />\ncookbook recipe for therapy with less than a tenthof-one-percent failure rate.\"<br />\nCowley clearly does not see emergency rooms in<br />\nregular hospitals as substitutes for centers such as<br />\nShock Trauma. He says, \"Severe trauma is an unchecked killer that cannot be controlled in traditional<br />\nemergency rooms.\" He adds, \"The non-system we<br />\nhave of treatment these injured patients is grossly inadequate.\" As Cowley sees it, trauma centers are the<br />\nonly way to help the critically injured. As he says,<br />\n\"Hospitals aren't geared for trauma victims, becaUse<br />\nthey interfere with a hospital's daily operation. Most<br />\nhospitals close at three o'clock in the afternoon.

If a severely<br />\ninjured victim who needs a total-care facility arrives,<br />\nit can take several hours to put it all together.\" As can<br />\nbe clearly seen, such a person is in trouble. A person<br />\nwho is suffering from trauma has at most an hour.<br />\n\"At Shock Trauma, we treat accident victims as if they<br />\nhad standing appointments,\" Dr. Cowley explained.<br />\nDiagnosis and treatment of each individual occur<br />\nso swiftly in the first couple of hours that procedures<br />\noften appear less rehearsed than they actually are.<br /><br />\nR. Adams Cowle<br /><br />\nCowley says, however,\"We can't do our jobs without<br />\nputting numbers and protocols in place of hunches and<br />\npersonal experiences.\"<br />\nNone of these great results would be possible, of<br />\ncourse, without Shock Trauma. With Shock Trauma<br />\nand MIEMSS coordinating trauma care throughout<br />\nthe state of Maryland, training and certifying<br />\nparamedics, training physicians in advanced trauma<br />\nlife support, and many other functions, the role of<br />\nthese institutions is critical.<br />\nSince Shock Trauma treats only about 1,000 seriously<br />\ninjured patients in Maryland, the state-wide support<br />\nsystem of MIEMSS is also important. Maryland is<br />\ndivided into five emergency medical services regions,<br /><br />\neach of which has an area trauma center. Patients are<br />\nnot only transferred from these ancillary centers to<br />\nShock Trauma in Baltimore, but are also taken directly<br />\nby helicopter from the scene of an accident to Shock<br />\nTrauma.<br />\nShock Trauma's coordination of emergency medical<br />\nsystems extends beyond the regional trauma centers.<br />\nIt also involves many private institutions. Incorporated<br />\nwithin the entire emergency medical services of the<br />\nstate of Maryland are some facilities at the East<br />\nBaltimore campus of Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins'<br />\nparticipation ir the various facets of trauma care includes The Johns Hopkins Eye Trauma Center, the<br />\nPediatric Trauma Center, a 14-bed facility, designated<br />\nas a specialty ;referral center in 1973, a neo-natal<br />\nintensive-care limit at Johns Hopkins, and the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospiital, which became a regional trauma<br />\ncenter in 1979.1To cope with the growing importance<br />\nof MIEMSS, iand specifically the Shock Trauma<br />\nCenter, the state, as of May, 1982, gave approval for<br />\nmaking architectural and engineering plans for a new<br />\n138-bed MIEMSS facility to be built by 1990. Once<br />\nthe old building has been Vacated, it will be renovated<br />\nfor use as basic research laboratories.<br />\nShock Trauma has overcome most of its adversaries<br />\nand critics in the outside world. It still, however, must<br />\ndeal with one of the greatest problems facing it\u2014the<br />\nhigh burnout rate of professionals who work in the<br />\nfacility.

Wolman says that<br />\nif<br />\neverything else is equal, a woman or minority will<br />\nbe<br />\nchosen. Green advertises in Women in Engineering.<br />\nGreen, however, \"doesn't remember having<br />\nany<br />\nwomen applicants.\" Green, who has been at Hopkin<br />\ns<br />\nfor 20 years, finds this hard to believe, for his<br />\ndepartment has \"more woman grad students than we've<br />\never<br />\nhad ...most applicants in engineering are foreign<br />\nnationals...most grad students are foreign nationals,\"<br />\nbut the latter is \"not true in my department.\"<br />\nThe committee invites select people to come for an<br />\ninterview. Usually, between three and seven people are<br />\ninvited. \"The fewer the better,\" says Wolman. By this<br />\ntime the letters of recommendation are received. Letters are only required from the final candidates.<br />\nTravel plans may determine the order of interviews.<br />\nGarvey says that \"a lot of effort goes to meet these<br />\npeople, with limited funds allotted for travel.\" The<br />\napplicant's file and labels it \"complete\" or \"incom- candid<br />\nate is given a description of the department and<br />\nplete.\" For all departments, the committee goes over<br />\nfaculty. Each candidate visits Hopkins, speaks with<br />\nall applications. There may be hundreds for a single<br />\nfaculty members, is taken to lunch and dinner, and<br />\nposition, as was the case in the Psychology Depart- attends<br />\nsocial functions.

For one recent opening in chairman of the Depart<br />\nment Of Physics.<br /><br />\nBesides teaching ability, researCh plans and -ability<br />\nas a scientist, personality is also important. The<br />\nperson must fit in with the department. Green wants<br />\nsomeone who will be content at a small, \"relatively<br />\npoorly equipped\" school. \"An introvert won't work<br />\nwell here,\" says Green. Fisher wants someone with<br />\nwhom one \"can form a large intellectual connection.\"<br />\nThe decision is made. If no one is selected, the<br />\nsearch will begin again the next fall. Usually, of course,<br />\nsomeone is selected. The applicant is contacted.

The dean is<br />\nnotified, and the salary is determined. Often members<br />\nof the department will help their new colleague find<br />\nhousing.<br />\n\"Academic mills grind slowly,\" says Dr. Moos.<br />\nMoos also says that years ago, everything was done<br />\nby personal contact. Wolman, citing the fact that now<br />\nmany professionals are married to other professionals<br />\nand must be accommodated, says that the process \"is<br />\nmuch more complicated than it was several years ago.\"<br /><br />\nINTERVIEWS WILL BE HELD<br />\nFOR THE POSITIONS OF CHAIRMEN<br /><br />\nof<br />\nStudent Council Film Series<br />\nUnion Board<br />\nConcert Committee<br />\nSpeaker Committee<br />\nElections Commission<br />\nFine Arts Committee<br />\nFrom Monday, March 14 to Thursday, March 18<br />\nSign Up At The Student Council Office<br />\nQuestions?<br />\nCall Danny Kao at 338-8203 or 366-2835<br /><br />\nDresses,Dressers At Discount<br />\nselection of clothes of any of the stores<br />\nin the area.

At<br />\nthe Salvation Army, the clothes are easily accessible and there are fairly wide<br />\naisles between the long racks of clothing.<br />\nEverything is sorted out and labeled, so<br />\nthings are easy to find.

Because the Salvation Army has<br />\nso many more clothes than the area's<br />\nother thrift stores, it is easier to find<br />\nthings there. Wool skirts and sweaters<br />\nare always available as well as good<br />\nsuits, dresses and shirts. One drawback<br />\nhere, however, is the lack of a dressing<br />\nroom.<br />\nBefore going shopping for clothes at<br />\nthrift stores, one should measure the<br />\nwaists and lengths of skirts, pants and<br />\nother clothes he or she currently wears.<br />\nThen the tape measure should be taken<br />\nalong so that clothes at the stores can<br />\nbe sized. To aid shoppers, Goodwill<br />\nwrites the waist sizes of pants and skirts<br />\non the price tags. It is important to be<br />\nsure that the clothes you are buying fit,<br />\nbecause they can't be returned. Clothes<br />\nshould also be examined closely for<br />\nholes, rips and the like.

A wide range of merchandise<br />\nis available at these stores such as<br />\nclothing, dishes and furniture.<br />\nA Goodwill Industries brochure describes the Waverly store as \"the place<br />\nto go t'or name-label clothing,\" and one<br />\nof the main features of the store is the<br />\nlarge selection of clothes including a lot<br />\nof brand-name things. The Hampden<br />\nstore doesn't have as many clothes, but<br />\nit has more shoes, pajamas and underclothes. While there may seem to be<br />\nquite a bit of out-dated \"tacky\" clothes,<br />\nthere are also many good-quality items<br />\nto be found. Wool and even cashmere<br />\nsweaters in perfect condition are mixed<br />\nwith other sweaters and vests with missing buttons and torn sleeves. The key to<br />\nlooking at clothes here, or at any other<br />\nthirft store, is to look at every single<br />\nthing.<br />\nShirts and blouses (both men's and<br />\nwomen's) are $1.89; pants (men's and<br />\nwomen's) are $1.89; vests and sweaters<br />\nare $2.79; jeans are $3.69 and up;<br />\nblazers and jackets are $4.59; men's<br />\ncomplete suits start at $10 and women's<br />\nare $5.49; nightgowns and pajamas are<br />\n51-2; dresses are priced from $2.79 to<br />\n$3.69; and skirts are $2.79. Winter coats<br />\nand clothes are currently marked down<br />\nat both stores, and the Waverly store has<br />\njust started getting spring clothes. Both<br />\nGoodwill stores have frequent markdowns and sales of their clothes. The<br />\nWaverly store almost always has several<br />\ntables or racks of clothes at especially<br />\nlow prices. Both the stores have private<br />\ndressing rooms.<br />\nThe Salvation Army has the largest<br /><br />\nsale. The furniture sold is fairly basic:<br />\ndesks, dressers, tables, chairs and sofas.<br />\nOf the three stores, Salvation Army has<br />\nthe most for sale. Right now they have<br />\nquite a few dressers and desks priced<br />\nfrom $25-40; armchairs from 519.50-22.50;<br />\nsofas and recliners at $39 on up; and end<br />\ntables for $8-12. Bed and mattress sets<br />\nare also sold. The Hampden Goodwill<br />\nhas more and somewhat better furniture<br />\nthan the Waverly store. Several dinette<br />\nsets, dressers ($25-35), desks ($30), and<br />\nend tables are all available at Hampden.<br />\nThe Waverly store has some chests,<br />\ndesks and cabinets, but they are generally higher priced and not in as good con-<br /><br />\ndition as the furniture sold at Hampden'.<br />\nBoth Hampden and Waverly stores sell<br />\nheadboards and new mattresses. Currently Hampden has some very nice<br />\nsofas, armchairs and recliners at extremely low prices.<br />\nMany pieces of furniture at the stores<br />\nhave several coats of paint on them and<br />\nso may not look very good, but only a<br />\nlittle work, i.e., stripping, repainting or<br />\nstaining, would be needed to improve<br />\ntheir appearance.<br />\nPlates, glasses, bowls, utensils, pots<br />\nand pans, ice cube trays and other kitchen equipment are sold at all three area<br />\nstores.

Some dishes, paintings, books, records and shoes are also<br />\nsold, but the store is too small to have<br />\nmuch of anything. Frequent trips there<br />\nare suggested as the turnover rate of<br />\nmerchandise is usually high.<br />\nFrequent trips to the other thrift<br />\nshops on Greenmount, including Hester's Thrift Shop, The Last Straw and<br />\nThe Curiosity Shop, are also suggested.<br />\nThese are relatively small and contain<br />\nfairly standard thrift-shop material.

It's very common to see what we would call leftover<br />\nhippies walking down the street,<br />\nespecially in university towns.<br />\n0-Almost everybody is very, very<br />\nsorry about the war and wish the whole<br />\nthing hadn't happened, except for a few<br />\npeople who run Bavaria.<br />\nIGerman bathrooms are kept very<br />\nclean, much cleaner than the Italian or<br />\nFrench, but the toilets have a grotesque<br />\nand anti-social design. (For a detailed<br />\ndescription, see Fear of Flying by Erica<br />\n.long: the section entitled, \"A Tour of<br />\nEurope by Toilet.\")<br />\nActually my observations might be<br />\nsomewhat distorted by the part of Germany in which I stayed. I was in<br />\nFreiberg, a relatively small city whose<br />\ntwo major functions are a large university and a brewery. Actually, the two are<br />\nsomewhat related. Freiberg is in the<br />\nformer Kingdom of Baden-Wirtenberg<br />\nin the southwest corner of the Federal<br />\nRepublic, a half-hour by train from<br />\nBasel, Switzerland, and a twenty-minute<br />\ndrive from Colmar, France (ten minutes<br />\nit' a German is driving).<br />\nThe Swiss Alps peter out well south<br />\nof this area, but it is very hilly. Freiberg<br />\nis situated right in the Black Forest; in<br />\nfact, the forest juts into the center of<br />\ntown. A large hill stands next to one of'<br />\nthe two remaining city gates from the<br />\ndays when Freiberg was walled. The hill<br />\nwas fortified as recently as World War<br />\nI, but now its major function is as a starting point for hiking trails that begin near<br />\nthe fortress walls. The view from up<br />\nthere, which had for centuries been used as a primitive form of aerial reconnaissance overlooking the valley, is now<br />\npresided over by a small state of<br />\nDionysus or some other god of wine<br />\nwho protects the vineyards below him.<br />\nHis bunch of grapes and his penis had<br />\nbeen spray painted bright red, but I<br />\nnever could find out it' this was part of<br />\nthe tradition or not.<br /><br />\nFreiberg has no suburbs. Small farms<br />\nand vineyards begin very quickly as you<br />\nleave the city, and every day, long<br />\nbefore I would wake up, farmers would<br />\nbring their vegetables and flowers to the<br />\nold town square, the Munsterplatz. The<br />\nsquare was rebuilt after being bombed<br />\nout in the war, so it still looks as it had<br />\nfor hundreds of years. The Gothic<br />\ncathedral in the center was somehow untouched, and the farmers' market goes<br />\non all around this building, especially on<br />\nWednesdays and Saturdays. These are<br />\nthe traditional farmers, whose plots of<br />\nland are too small to modernize and<br />\noften on land that is too hilly for cash<br />\nfarming. They work much as generations of icrinan ?al ink..rs ha% ,\u2018 worked<br />\nraising radishes, potatoes and other<br />\nvegetables to sell in town, and keeping<br />\ncows.<br />\nThe students who dominate the other<br />\nhalt' of town come from all over Germany as well as other nations, and they<br />\nbelong to a different century from the<br /><br />\nfarmers. There are bars catering to<br />\nstudents all over town, usually located<br />\nin cellars under shops. Many of these<br />\nplaces are mini-discos or even, God help<br />\nus, full-size ones. Some have got to be<br />\nGreen Party headquarters. Many contain a sizeable collection of hippies with<br /><br />\nmembers of the punk movement, far<br />\nmore visible than ii is in Ilaltlinthe. (It's<br />\nbeen moving overseas ever since the Rat<br />\n(fisconiinued punk nights.)<br />\nThe '60s-style leftists are a presence<br />\nin Germany, and it' they are not a large<br />\nproportion of the population (they're<br />\nprobably at most 5.6 percent), they are<br />\ncertainly not pariahs, at least not among<br />\nthe students. It's hard to tell as an outsider if they have influence beyond their<br />\nnumbers, or if a very small number of<br />\npeople is producing enormous amounts<br />\nof graffiti.<br />\nThere are two programs in Freiberg<br />\nthat are available t'or Hopkins students,<br />\nboth of which are run by the Institute<br />\nof European Studies in Chicago. One is<br />\nfor German speakers, and gives students<br />\na chance to take courses at the university as well as some German courses at<br />\nIES, which is a little easier on people<br />\nwho need to ask what a word means<br />\nevery once in a while.<br />\nThere's also an English-speaking program which concentrates on the European Economic Community, the cornmon market. The courses have a tendency to overlap, and they don't involve a<br />\nlot of depth, but the program gives a<br />\nsolid background in current European<br />\n\u2022 politics.<br />\nPart of the program includes ten days<br />\nof traveling. The German speakers go<br />\nto Berlin. The EEC does one of those<br />\nwhirlwind \"If it's Tuesday, this must be<br />\nBelgium tours of several Northern<br />\nEuropean cities which are the seats of<br />\nthe different international organizations.<br />\nThe tour also goes to Amsterdam for<br />\nreasons that transcend mere academic<br />\nutility.<br />\nIn general, the programs offer a good<br />\nchance to live and play in a town that<br />\nnot many tourists see, where Americans<br />\nare still scarce enough so you get neither<br />\nthe tourist traps nor the hostility that<br />\ncan come from being too close to a major landmark or an Army base.

It's as good a blanket<br />\nstatement as any for what's wrong with<br />\nthis movie.<br />\nThe setting is Jakarta, Indonesia,<br />\n1965. Australian journalist Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson)arrives during the last<br />\ndays of the Sukarno regime to cover the<br />\npower struggles between the government, the military, and two primary insurrectionist factions, the Moslems and<br />\nthe Communists. He is befriended by<br />\nBilly Kwan (Linda Hunt), a ChineseAustralian photographer whose desire<br />\nto control the lives of the people he cares<br />\nabout far outstrips his dwarfish stature.<br />\nAs the two send reports and pictures<br />\nback to Sydney, Hamilton is gradually<br />\nintroduced to the social and political injustices that have drawn Billy to become<br />\na sort of diminutive champion of the oppressed. \"What then must we do?\" is poverty, mysticism (an elaborate<br />\nKwan's mantra about the poor, echoing metaphor comparing Billy, Guy and Jill<br />\nTolstoy and St. Luke before him; his to the principal puppets in a Japanese<br />\ntheory is that one should do all in his shadow-play is one of the chief elements<br />\npower to help those nearest him, a doc- of the early part of the film), journalistic<br />\ntrine he tries to instill in Guy, whose ethics, and the fate of love and altruism<br />\nnature is more of the go-getting, under a dictatorship, it doesn't deal<br />\nsatisfactorily with any of them. On the<br />\nanything-for-a-story type.<br />\nThrough Billy, Hamilton meets Jill surface, the movie seems to be about<br />\nBryant (Sigourney Weaver), assistant to many things; by the time we reach the<br />\nthe British military attache.

The story then switch- sets lit in various degrees of shadow and<br />\nes to the question: Will the main dim light; Weir handles some scenes,<br />\ncharacters be able to get out of Jakarta especially Billy's and Guy's coverage of<br />\na Communist rally, with a good sense<br />\nbefore the shooting starts?<br />\nof blocking and motion; backgrounds<br />\nthat<br />\nis<br />\nthis<br />\nof<br />\nall<br />\nwith<br />\nThe problem<br />\nwhile it brings up matters of politics, are peopled with bizarre, often dis-<br /><br />\nrts<br />\nfigured Indonesian peasants. Gibson<br />\nand Weaver are presented handsomely<br />\nenough, and Michael Murphy is weirdly interesting as a crass, sex-starved<br />\nWashington Post reporter, but nobody<br />\nholds up to the camera's eye like Hunt<br />\ndoes as Billy; after a while you stop<br />\nthinking this is a woman playing a man<br />\nand begin to concentrate instead on the<br />\nquirky mannerisms and physical grace<br />\nwith which she imbues her performance.<br />\nBut even this character gets short<br />\nshrift in the long run. The screenplay,<br /><br />\na collaboration between three writers<br />\n(David Williamson, Weir and C.J.<br />\nKoch, who wrote the 1978 novel the film<br />\nis based on), contains several elements<br />\nthat ought to connect with each other<br />\n!but don't. For instance, the puppet<br />\nmetaphor is dropped once Guy and Jill<br />\nare together; the film then traces their<br />\nrelationship and Billy's growing dissatisfaction with Sukarno's inhumane<br />\npolicies on two separate tracks, to the<br />\npoint that Billy's suicidal act of<br />\ndissidence, and the reasons for it, barely register on the two people he is most<br />\nattached to.<br />\nEven the military coup seems incidental in this morass of screenplay elements.<br />\nIt happens almost entirely offscreen,<br />\nwith the result that the viewer unfamiliar<br />\nwith the historical background of the<br />\nfilm is uncertain of exactly who is<br />\nfighting whom.<br />\nThe love story, too, leads eventually<br />\nnowhere. Guy and Jill are so postured<br />\nand self-involved that one finds it hard<br />\nto care whether or not they get out of<br />\nthe country alive.

We're as deep as we've ever<br />\nbeen defensively. If we can put the chemistry together<br />\nwe'll have a nice squad to work with. This team will<br />\nbe able to compete with anybody.\"<br />\nComing off a 11-3 1982 season, including a 7-5<br />\nNCAA Division I Championship Game loss to North<br />\nCarolina, second-ranked Hopkins will open the 1983<br />\nlacrosse season tomorrow when they host UMBC at<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\n1982 Lacrosse Rankings<br />\nNCAA Division I<br />\nNo.<br />\n1 .<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n8<br /><br />\nSchool<br />\nNorth Carolina<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nVirginia<br />\nCornell<br />\nArmy<br />\nAdelphi<br />\nMaryland<br />\nNavy<br /><br />\nRecord<br />\n14-0<br />\n11-3<br />\n10-3<br />\n11-2<br />\n10-4<br />\n10-5<br />\n10-5<br />\n6-5<br /><br />\nSince Ciccarone took the head coaching reins from<br />\nBob Scott in 1975, the Jays have compiled a 93-14<br />\nrecord. The taxers have'appeared in the last six national championship games. After winning three successive titles in 1978, 1979 and 1980, Hopkins lost to<br />\nNorth Carolina in both the 1981 and 1982 championships. This year the Jays will be trying to regain the<br />\nnumber-one spot from a team that has won 26 consecutive games over the last two seasons.<br />\nThe Blue Jays lost eight players to graduation last<br />\nyear. In addition to losing two-time first-team AllAmerican attackman Jeff Cook and second-team AllAmerican defenseman Dave Black, Hopkins will be<br />\nwithout the services of attackmen Mike Donnelly,<br />\nCraig Cook and Kyle Hicks, and midfielders Joe Ciletti,<br />\nJeff Kendall and Brian Huntley. With the exception<br />\nof Black, the entire 1982 defense is returning, as are<br />\ngoalies Brian Holman and Larry Quinn.<br />\nMeanwhile, North Carolina has an unprecedented<br />\nfive first-team All-Americans returning to their starting lineup. They include last season's Player of t'<br />\nYear Tom Sears (goalie), Mike Burnett (attackman),<br />\nPeter Voelkel (middle), Jeff Homiere (middle) and<br />\nJohn Haus (defender<br /><br />\n\"We have more weapons than in the past. Our offense is more balanced,\" Cantelli explained. \"Last<br />\nyear our offense was easier to defend\u2014they'd concentrate on Jeff. This year everyone's a threat.\"<br />\nIn the midfield, Hopkins is strong. The key midfielders include three All-Americans: Bill Cantelli,<br />\nJohn Krumenacker and Henry Ciccarone, Jr.; Del<br />\nDressel, a transfer from Harvard and a \"real asset\"<br />\naccording to Coach Cicearone; and senior Kirk<br />\nBaugher. Ciccarone intends to make use of his midfield depth this year by running the midfielders more<br />\nand looking for fast breaks.<br />\n\"Defensively we're in a 'position to do some things<br />\nthat we haven't been able to do before because of the<br />\npersonnel,\" noted Ciccarole. Senior Marty Bergin will<br />\nanchor the defense. He wiI1 be assisted by seniors Jim<br />\nEsposito and Haswell Frariklin, juniors Walt Carswell<br />\nand Steve Dubin, sophothore Guy Matricciani and<br />\nfreshman John DeTommaSo. Also, Frank DeVita and<br />\nBrian Baumgardner will he used frequently. \"Our<br />\ndefense is real solid,\" said Ciccarone.<br />\nWhile the Jay goalies are not in the same class as<br />\nNorth Carolina's Tom Sears, they are close. \"I<br />\nthought last year in the Championship game Brian<br />\nHolman played just as well as Sears,\" commented Ciccarone. \"Sears was definitely more consistent. He had<br />\na great season and was named Player of the Year.\"<br />\nSenior Brian Holman will start in goal, but he will have<br />\nto share his playing time with sophomore Larry Quinn.<br />\n\"I'm not hesitant to play both goalies this year,\" Ciccarone said.<br /><br />\nRob Lord shoots under pressure.<br /><br />\nA major factor in the Blue Jay performance this<br />\nseason could very well be the addition of Don Zimmerman to the coaching staff. Zimmerman, a former<br />\nAll-American lacrosse player at Hopkins, spent the last<br />\nfour years as an assistant to Willie Scroggs at North<br />\nCarolina. Ciccarone calls the addition of Zimmerman<br />\na gain for Hopkins as well as a loss for North Carolina.<br />\n\"Needless to say, Don's addition to our staff has made<br />\na big difference,\" explained Ciccarone. \"It's a great<br />\nhelp for me to have somebody like Don here as a fulltime member of our staff.\" Zimmerman, who will run<br />\nthe Jay offense, is looking forward to his first season<br />\non the Hopkins staff. \"With hard work and a good<br />\nattitude,\" he said, \"I think we can go all the way.\"<br />\nThe Jays will be looking to take advantage of their<br />\nmidfield and defensive depth this season. According<br />\nto Ciccarone, the Jays will press the ball hard and<br />\nrotate players in and out in order to keep fresh laxers<br />\nin at all times. \"We'll be able to give opponents different looks on defense throughout the game,\" he<br />\ncommented. Hopkins will be looking to fast break and<br />\nscore off the transition game. \"We're going to push<br />\nthe ball upfield more, as opposed to settling it down,\"<br />\n1933 captain Bill Cantelli<br />\nnoted Cantelli.<br />\nAllreturning<br />\nfive<br />\nhas<br />\nCarolina<br />\nNorth<br />\nAlthough<br />\nAmericans,\"We've got five too,\" reminded Hopkins<br />\n1982 NCAA Division I First Team All-Americans<br />\ncaptain Bill Cantelli.

Also, Gary Benninghoff, Brent Ciccarone, Rob Field.\"We know we have the potential: It's just a matLord and Willy Odenthal should be key members of ter of putting it together on the field,\" said Cantelli.<br />\n\"Everybody has good feelings about the team.\"<br />\nthe Hopkins attack.<br /><br />\nPeter Scott<br />\n413 Attack<br />\nJunior<br />\n5'11\", 175<br />\nGladwyne, Pa.<br />\nLast year Scott was a third-team All-American, and<br />\nhe should provide leadership on attack. The junior was<br />\nthe top scorer on the 1982 Jays with 35 goals. \"Last<br />\nseason Pete was a good scorer,\" said Coach Ciccarone,<br />\n\"but this year we expect him to balance out. He'll probably get more assists.\" Scott is an excellent dodger<br />\nand also a strong rider on clears. Noting Scott's allaround ability, offensive coach Don Zimmerman<br />\nhopes that Scott will be the \"the quarterback of the<br />\nteam.\"<br /><br />\nRob Lord<br />\n419 Attack<br />\nSenior<br />\n5'9\", 160<br />\nWestminster, Md.<br />\n\"We're counting on Rob to come into his own this<br />\nyear,\" said Coach Ciccarone. Last year, while playing in spots, Lord scored eight goals to go with four<br />\nassists. Rob is also an excellent feeder, as well as a<br />\ngood player without the ball. According to captain Bill<br />\nCantelli,\"Rob is a good broken-field-type player, who<br />\nexcells in the unsettled situation.\" Lord should fit in<br />\nwell with the new, more wide-open offensive philosophy.<br /><br />\nGary Benninghoff<br />\n423 Attack<br />\nSenior<br />\n6'4\", 210<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nBenninghoff got off to an excellent start in 1982,<br />\nthough he was slowed by injuries late in the season.<br />\nStill, his 19 goals were third best on the team. Besides<br />\nlacrosse, Benninghoff played soccer and basketball for<br />\nHopkins. Speaking about Benninghoff, captain Bill<br />\nCarnal said, \"He's excellent on the crease. His size<br />\nmakes him a good screener, and his 'basketball instincts' help him in lacrosse, especially with setting<br />\npicks.\" Coach Ciccarone expects a big year from<br />\nBenninghoff.<br /><br />\nWilly Odenthal<br />\n48 Attack<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'0\", 180<br />\nHuntington, N.Y.<br /><br />\n..<br />\nill<br /><br />\nLast year Odenthal was a middie, but in order to<br />\nget some depth on attack, Coach Ciccarone switched<br />\nhim to attack. \"Willy played attack in high school,\"<br />\nsaid Ciccarone. \"He's a very capable dodger and<br />\nshould see much action.\"<br /><br />\nBrent Ciccarone<br />\n#11 Attack<br />\nJunior<br />\n6'0\", 170<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nThe younger of the coach's two sons on the squad,<br />\nBrent Ciccarone is an excellent rider as well as a strong<br />\noffensive player. Says his father, \"Brent is probably<br />\nthe best screener on the team.\"<br /><br />\nMike Lynch<br />\n#30 Midfield<br />\nSenior<br />\n5'11\", 170<br />\nMassapequa, N.Y.<br />\n\"One of the smartest midfielders we've ever had\"<br />\nis the way Ciccarone described this senior. While a leg<br />\ninjury has slowed Lynch in the past, leadership and<br />\nsteady play is expected from him this season. Cantelli<br />\nfeels that while Lynch may not have the physical ability<br />\nof some of the other players, \"he is always in the right<br />\nplace at the right time to make the big play.\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 17<br />\nBill Cantelli<br />\n#7 Midfield<br />\nSenior<br />\n5'8\", 160<br />\nValley Stream, N.Y.<br /><br />\nRich Glancy<br />\n#9 Midfield<br />\nJunior<br />\n5'9\", 175<br />\nMaplewood, N.J.<br /><br />\nGuy Matricciani<br />\n#28 Defense<br />\nSophomore<br />\n5'9\", 170 Baltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nAn honorable-mention All-American last season,<br />\nsenior Cantelli has been named captain of the Jays.<br />\nTermed \"a fine all-around player\" by Ciccarone,<br />\nCantelli should provide the team with leadership.<br />\nCoach Zimmerman feels that Cantelli's style of play<br />\nshould fit in well with the 1983 Blue Jays: \"He plays<br />\nboth offense and defense well, and we're stressing<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nInterestingly, Cantelli feels that the captain is most<br />\nimportant not on game day, but during practice. \"A<br />\ncaptain is not only a leader, but also a motivator. We<br />\npractice five days a week, and it's tough to get the<br />\nplayers up for practice every day. It's my job to get<br />\neveryone mentally prepared for practice. By Saturday,<br />\nthough, either you're ready or you're not.\"<br />\nYet, if necessary, Cantelli will take charge on game<br />\nday. \"As captain, if someone needs a talking to, I'll<br />\ndo it,\" he said. \"And a captain has to take things into his own hands. This will probably put more pressure<br />\non me.\"<br /><br />\nGlancy was in the midst of a fine season a year ago<br />\nuntil torn ligaments sidelined him for the final games.<br />\nNow recovdre_d from his injury, he should see a lot of<br />\nplaying time at midfield and also help with the faceoffs.<br />\nAn excellent ground-ball man, he had 43 last year. Glancy is also a good defensive middie. Bill Cantelli calls<br />\nRich \"an important player.\"<br /><br />\nMatricciani had an outstanding freshman year. He<br />\nled the defense in ground balls with 57 and Ciccarone<br />\ncalls him \"one of the best ground-ball defensemen I've<br />\never seen. Guy may also be used as a defensive middie,<br />\nas he's fast and an excellent stick handler.-<br /><br />\nDel Dressel<br />\n#4 Midfield<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'2\", 170<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nJohn Krumenacker<br />\n#32 Midfield<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'3\", 175<br />\nFarmingdale, N.Y.<br />\nWith 16 goals and 11 assists as a freshman,<br />\nKrumenacker was named third-team All-American last<br />\nyear. He had a superb season. Ciccarone described<br />\nKrumenacker as \"the most poised freshman we've ever<br />\nhad.\" Coach Zimmerman went even further, saying<br />\nKrumenacker \"played as well as any freshman I've<br />\never seen.\" Zimmerman also called Krumenacker a<br />\nvery dedicated player. Even with all the success of his<br />\nfirst season, Coach Ciccarone expects the sophomore<br />\nto be better this year.<br /><br />\nA.1 r<br /><br />\n\"Unlimited talent\" is Zimmerman's assessment of<br />\nDel Dressel's potential. A transfer from Harvard,<br />\nDressel had to sit out his freshman season. Dressel is<br />\nconsidered an all-around threat, good on ground balls,<br />\noffense and defense.<br />\nBill Cantelli feels that while Dressel has shown a lot<br />\nof ability, he is still short on game experience. \"Del's<br />\nlooked good so far, but he's still learning the system.<br />\nHe's like a freshman as far as strategy,\" noted the<br />\ncaptain.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1 if 41**AL V-41 -IL<br />\n1 \u202241.4.<br />\n41.******************* 4.<br /><br />\n!BLUE<br /><br />\n1<br />\nSteve Dubin<br />\n#37 Defense<br />\nJunior<br />\n5'9\", 170<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nJAY<br /><br />\nGreg Matthews<br />\n#12 Midfield<br />\nSophomore<br />\n5'9\", 175<br />\nFranklin Square, N.Y.<br />\nOne of a pair of excellent sophomore faceoff men<br />\nfor the Blue Jays.

He has all the ability in the world.<br />\nHe's big and can take the ball away.\" Carswell played<br />\nfor the Jays two years ago, but missed last season.<br />\nCoach Ciccarone expects Carswell to be \"a dominant<br />\nforce on defense.\"<br /><br />\nAn honorable-mention All-American, Holman had<br />\na fine 1982 season, making 142 saves while allowing<br />\nonly 81 goals. Ciccarone feels that Holman \"works<br />\nhard and does a good job. But he must take total<br />\ncharge on defense.\" Holman will be the Jays' starting<br />\ngoalie.<br /><br />\nJohn DeTommaso<br />\n#41 Defense<br />\nFreshman<br />\n6'0\", 185<br />\nFarmingdale, N.Y.<br /><br />\nLarry Quinn<br />\n#21 Goal<br />\nSophomore<br />\n6'0\", 170<br />\nLevittown, N.Y.<br /><br />\nA freshman from Farmingdale High School, John<br />\nshould be an important member of this year's Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team.
