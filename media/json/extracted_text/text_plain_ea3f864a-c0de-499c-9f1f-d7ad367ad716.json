We don't know, nor do we<br />\nconsider it especially important.<br />\nWe will repeat that we think the BSA sincere anclhardworking in its efforts to supply a rounded social<br />\nprogram at a nominal cost. But we do think the burden too difficult to transport successfully under the<br />\npresent handicapped set-up.<br />\nThe requirement of 300 pledges is not an unfair<br />\none,sand yet is one which will prove a boomerang to<br />\nthe Board repeatedly. The number is high, and requires time to collect. Big name bands are business<br />\norganizations which unfortunately associate with themselves such mundane matters as options and contracts.<br />\nTime, tide, and options wait for no man. We may well<br />\nexpect a recurrence of the Dorsey affair.<br />\nWe call once again then to the Student council's<br />\nattention our formula of last issue. Let the class<br />\ndues go toward the foundation for a successful, attractively-priced social program. With this basis,<br />\nblanket pledges for a social season should be easily<br />\nprocurable, since prices will have a guaranteed low<br />\nlevel. And likewise, under such a complete plan, the<br />\nnecessity for class dues as a sinking fund to cope with<br />\nfinancial disaster will be obviated.<br />\nA hasty calculation reveals that if only 300 tickets were sold at three dollars per, optionally deductable from caution money, these tickets to cover an<br />\nentire social season, used in conjunction with class<br />\ndues this money could provide for two big-name<br />\ndances and two small ones, with no chance of \"going<br />\nunder\". And the more tickets sold (at this or a lower<br />\nprice) the more functions would this season include.<br />\nWe can see nothing wrong with the plan. It entails a mere diversion of funds, compulsorily paid that<br />\nthey may benefit more students to a greater extent. It<br />\neliminates uncertainty on the part of producers and redipients. And it guarantees a successful social program.<br />\nTo the discretion of the BSA then, might be left<br />\nthe planning of the program. To the discretion of the<br />\nstudent body\u2014its extent.<br />\nPro tern, we \u2022rest our case.

Herein Hitler expressly states<br />\nthat the downfall of old Germany was due to its imperialistic policy, a failing to be avoided at all costs.<br />\nAnd yet, paradoxically, last Monday the self-same<br />\nauthor demanded a restoration of all of Germany's<br />\npre-war colonies, \u2022as well as a more equal distribution<br />\nof colonial riches among have and have-not nations.<br />\nMaking no mention of either Memel or the Ukraine,<br />\nand merely cautioning a friendly neutrality on the<br />\npart of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and neighboring states,<br />\nthe address turned its focus from the continent abroad.<br />\nDespite the recognition, finally, of the fact that<br />\n\"Germany is and has been in a particularly trying economic situation\", and must fact the ever-present problems of lack of raw materials, over-population, and<br />\nshortage of trade, we cannot see Hitler envisioning a<br />\nreturn of Germany's colonies as his solution. The figures bear out the facts. Of the six basic raw materials:<br />\niron, coal, copper, rubber, oil, cotton, these lands had<br />\nand still have none to speak of. Southwest Africa's trifling percentage of copper production has itself now<br />\nceased.<br />\nIn consideration of trade or population importance<br />\nthe figures are just as significant. Prior to 1914 only<br />\n20,000 Germans had emigrated to colonies. True, there<br />\nwas no Hitler to enforce such action, but again, enforced colonization is rarely if ever successful. Of a<br />\ntotal world trade of 40 billion dollars, these colonies<br />\nwere only participating to the extent of less than 800<br />\nmillion. And Hitler's own argument\u2014\"The pretext<br />\nthat these colonial possessions are of no value should<br />\njustify their return\"\u2014shows his recognition of these<br />\nsalient points.<br />\nThat the Rome-Berlin axis is the answer we realize.<br />\nBut we cannot believe that it is the answer from the<br />\npoint of view which Hitler seemed so anxious to impress. True, the Reich owes Italy a debt. True, also,<br />\nthat Italy as a colony grabber seems to make Hitler's<br />\noffer of alliance, in case of any attack on her, valid.<br />\nHowever, we cannot escape the conviction that Adolf<br />\nis not quite the knight in shining armor he would have<br />\nthe world believe. Far more important to him, we believe is assurance of Italian alliance When he stops<br />\nhis silly colony chatter and returns tq the drang nach<br />\nosten.

Shall we<br />\nchastise the BSA for dallying too long, and expecting<br />\ntoo much on too short notice? . . . or the Dean for<br />\ninsisting on 300 guarantees before allowing corltwt?<br />\n. . . or us, the students, ourselves, for delaying too<br />\nlong in signing pledges? We don't know, nor do we<br />\nconsider it especially important.<br />\nWe will repeat that we think the BSA sincere anclhardworking in its efforts to supply a rounded social<br />\nprogram at a nominal cost. But we do think the burden too difficult to transport successfully under the<br />\npresent handicapped set-up.<br />\nThe requirement of 300 pledges is not an unfair<br />\none,sand yet is one which will prove a boomerang to<br />\nthe Board repeatedly. The number is high, and requires time to collect. Big name bands are business<br />\norganizations which unfortunately associate with themselves such mundane matters as options and contracts.<br />\nTime, tide, and options wait for no man. We may well<br />\nexpect a recurrence of the Dorsey affair.<br />\nWe call once again then to the Student council's<br />\nattention our formula of last issue. Let the class<br />\ndues go toward the foundation for a successful, attractively-priced social program. With this basis,<br />\nblanket pledges for a social season should be easily<br />\nprocurable, since prices will have a guaranteed low<br />\nlevel. And likewise, under such a complete plan, the<br />\nnecessity for class dues as a sinking fund to cope with<br />\nfinancial disaster will be obviated.<br />\nA hasty calculation reveals that if only 300 tickets were sold at three dollars per, optionally deductable from caution money, these tickets to cover an<br />\nentire social season, used in conjunction with class<br />\ndues this money could provide for two big-name<br />\ndances and two small ones, with no chance of \"going<br />\nunder\". And the more tickets sold (at this or a lower<br />\nprice) the more functions would this season include.<br />\nWe can see nothing wrong with the plan. It entails a mere diversion of funds, compulsorily paid that<br />\nthey may benefit more students to a greater extent. It<br />\neliminates uncertainty on the part of producers and redipients. And it guarantees a successful social program.<br />\nTo the discretion of the BSA then, might be left<br />\nthe planning of the program. To the discretion of the<br />\nstudent body\u2014its extent.<br />\nPro tern, we \u2022rest our case. We invite refutation.<br /><br />\nDesign<br />\nfor<br />\nDancing<br /><br />\nDeparture<br />\nFrom<br />\nMein Kampf<br /><br />\nThe enigma that is Hitler<br />\nfurthered itself a bit more<br />\nin our minds this week, by<br />\nvirtue of the radio and a<br />\ntwo-and-one-half-hour piece<br />\nof chip-on-my-shoulder declamation from the German<br /><br />\nfront.<br />\nFor the first time since his ascension to Germanic<br />\nsupremacy six years ago, der fuehrer made a radical<br />\ndeparture from the program so carefully outlined, and<br />\nheretofore so carefully adhered to, in the Aryan New<br /><br />\nTestament:Mein Kampf. Herein Hitler expressly states<br />\nthat the downfall of old Germany was due to its imperialistic policy, a failing to be avoided at all costs.<br />\nAnd yet, paradoxically, last Monday the self-same<br />\nauthor demanded a restoration of all of Germany's<br />\npre-war colonies, \u2022as well as a more equal distribution<br />\nof colonial riches among have and have-not nations.<br />\nMaking no mention of either Memel or the Ukraine,<br />\nand merely cautioning a friendly neutrality on the<br />\npart of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and neighboring states,<br />\nthe address turned its focus from the continent abroad.<br />\nDespite the recognition, finally, of the fact that<br />\n\"Germany is and has been in a particularly trying economic situation\", and must fact the ever-present problems of lack of raw materials, over-population, and<br />\nshortage of trade, we cannot see Hitler envisioning a<br />\nreturn of Germany's colonies as his solution. The figures bear out the facts. Of the six basic raw materials:<br />\niron, coal, copper, rubber, oil, cotton, these lands had<br />\nand still have none to speak of. Southwest Africa's trifling percentage of copper production has itself now<br />\nceased.<br />\nIn consideration of trade or population importance<br />\nthe figures are just as significant. Prior to 1914 only<br />\n20,000 Germans had emigrated to colonies. True, there<br />\nwas no Hitler to enforce such action, but again, enforced colonization is rarely if ever successful. Of a<br />\ntotal world trade of 40 billion dollars, these colonies<br />\nwere only participating to the extent of less than 800<br />\nmillion. And Hitler's own argument\u2014\"The pretext<br />\nthat these colonial possessions are of no value should<br />\njustify their return\"\u2014shows his recognition of these<br />\nsalient points.<br />\nThat the Rome-Berlin axis is the answer we realize.<br />\nBut we cannot believe that it is the answer from the<br />\npoint of view which Hitler seemed so anxious to impress. True, the Reich owes Italy a debt. True, also,<br />\nthat Italy as a colony grabber seems to make Hitler's<br />\noffer of alliance, in case of any attack on her, valid.<br />\nHowever, we cannot escape the conviction that Adolf<br />\nis not quite the knight in shining armor he would have<br />\nthe world believe. Far more important to him, we believe is assurance of Italian alliance When he stops<br />\nhis silly colony chatter and returns tq the drang nach<br />\nosten. And so we are forced to regard the address as<br />\na defensive rather than an aggressive instrument, one<br />\ndesigned to buy Italian good will at all costs.<br />\nThe House of Common's in England, however,<br />\nheard an interesting bit of comment a few weeks ago<br />\nwhen the Secretary of Colonies said there was no section of opinion in England favoring a return of the<br />\ncolonies to Germany. Yet we read that Mr. Chamberlain regards the address as a peaceful sign.<br />\nWhen the cauldron ceases boiling, the brew will be<br />\nstrange.<br />\nStudent interest should<br />\nrun high . concerning the<br />\nproceedings at the Council<br />\nmeeting this afternoon. The<br />\nhospitalization plan coming<br />\nup for discussion will air<br />\nthe grievances of those many<br />\nwho have bewailed the present scheme as offering<br />\nnothing new to the general student body, while requiring the payment of a compulsory fee.<br />\nConsidered as a whole, the student body does not<br />\nobject to a medical fee-, provided that a complete service, the benefits of which shall naturally accrue to<br />\nthem, is offered. Such an attitude is wholly understandable. The pressing need at the time to the minds of<br />\nmost, as well as to our own, is for some type of infirmary. The request is not an unreasonable one. It is,<br />\nlikewise, not too great.<br />\nA workable plan, feasible from the viewpoints of<br />\nboth administration and students should not be too<br />\ndifficult of evolution., We hope to see such a plan introduced and effected by the Council.<br /><br />\nA 'plaint<br />\nDraws to<br />\na Head<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,<br /><br />\nThe Alligator<br />\nand the<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE<br /><br />\nBuskin<br />\nCat<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\nVMV<br /><br />\nSock<br /><br />\nIt may be interesting for swing<br />\nlovers in the salons of our Greek<br />\ntents to get a bit of statistical information about the most langorous bit<br />\nof rhythm of 1938.
