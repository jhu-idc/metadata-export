The suggestion is designed to \"help private<br />\nhigher education maintain, or<br />\neven increase its share of total en-<br />\n<br />\nSteel sculpture to be<br />\ninstalled at library<br />\nAs part of the University's<br />\nCentennial celebration, a steel<br />\nsculpture will be installed on the<br />\nterrace wall of the Mc Library.<br />\nDr. Ferdinand Hamburger,<br />\nDirector of Centennial Planning,<br />\nrevealed that the sculpture is not<br />\nyet finished, but the project is<br />\nProceeding according to schedule.<br />\nTrustee Robert Henry Levi '37<br />\nand Ryda Hecht Levi donated<br />\nthe funds for the sculpture, to be<br />\ncreated by David Lee Brown. The<br />\nsculpture is scheduled to be installed in the summer of 1975<br />\nand will be dedicated on September 10, 1975, at eh official opening ceremony of the Centennial.<br />\nThe sculpture, five feet six inches high by eight feet wide, will<br />\nbe mounted on a six,foot pedestal straddling the terrace wall\u2014a<br />\nfew feet north of the quadrangle-side entrance to the Library.<br />\nBrown submitted his maquette, or model, of the sculpture as it will look upon completion. The piece is abstract, consisting of three-inch square tubes of<br />\nmirror-polished stainless steel several feet long. The projecting<br />\ntubes are expected to create an<br />\noverall fluid shape to convey<br />\nmovement. The artist is an 'innovator in the metal-working technique, in which stripes of steel<br />\nare bolted and welded, but nonne<br />\nof the connectives are visible<br />\nwhen the sculpture is finished.<br />\nIn describing the piece,<br />\nHamburger said, \"The intriguing<br />\nthing is that there is no front,<br />\nback, or wide. The sculpture is<br />\ninteresting from any angle viewed.\"<br />\nBrown was chosen by the<br />\nSculptor Selection Committee,<br />\nwhich was formed when the donation was made. Mrs. Levi served as chairwoman for Committee<br />\nmembers Tom Freudenheim, the<br />\ndirector of the Baltimore<br />\nMuseum of Art, Mrs. Alan<br />\nWurtzberger, who is now deceased, President Steven Muller, and<br />\nDr. Phoebe Stanton, Department<br />\nof Art History. Ex-officio -members included Dr. Hamburger and<br />\nMrs. Mary Johnson.<br />\nThe Committee-first examined<br />\nslides and brochures of available<br />\nsculpture, with the intent of purchasing an appropriate piece that<br />\nhad already been made. Eventually the Committee discareded this<br />\napproach and decided to commission a sculptor.<br />\nWhen an example of Brown's<br />\n<br />\nrollment.\"<br />\nThe report reads, in part: \"We<br />\nbelieve that such a program<br />\nwould be preferrable to expansion of direct institutional aid to<br />\nprivate schools'because it would<br />\ninvolve minimal interference with<br />\nprivate colleges and universities<br />\nand would enhance the principle<br />\nof student choice.\"<br />\nThe total cost of the \"tuition<br />\nequalization grants\" would approach $1.1 billion. The federal<br />\nshare Would be about $530 million the basis of 1974 enrollment<br />\nin private institutions.<br />\nThe Council also recommends<br />\nthe institution of a National Student Loan Bank to replace current student loan ,programs that<br />\nthe Council describes as bordering on \"potential disaster.\"<br />\nThe Council criticizes the present federally supported Guaranteed Loan Program because it.<br />\n\"tends to favor students whose<br />\nfamilies have good credit ratings<br />\nand high socioeconomic status.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe National Student Loan<br />\nBank favored by the Council<br />\nwould be a non-prat private<br />\ncorporation financed by the sale<br />\nof \"governmentally guaranteed<br />\nsecurities.\" It would be \"basically self-sustaining,\" since borrowers would repay their loatis at a<br />\nrate of at least three-fourths of<br />\none per cent of their incomes<br />\neach year for each $1000 borrowed until the loan and accrued<br />\ninterest was repaid.<br />\nAs a third major,new program,<br />\nthe Council calls for a system of<br />\nfederal financial support for large<br />\nresearch libraries. Suggested \"because financial stringency and exceptionally rapid increases in the<br />\ncost of library materials have resulted in sharp cutbacks,\" the<br />\nproposal stipulates an additional<br />\n$10 million in federal assistance<br />\nto this area.<br />\nThe federal monies would be<br />\nallocated \"on the basis of such<br />\nfactors as the number of doctoral<br />\ndegrees awarded and federal sup-<br />\n<br />\nport of academic science at each<br />\ninstituion.\"<br />\nThe Council also requests<br />\nthe expansion of the . Basic Education Opportunity Grants program of the federal government.<br />\nAnother existing prograni the<br />\nCouncil feels should be. expanded<br />\nis the Work-Study Program,<br />\nwhich has suffered from severe<br />\ncuts in federal allocatiOn at Hopkins.<br />\nThe report recommends that<br />\nexpenditures for Work-Study be<br />\nincreased from the $300 million<br />\nmade available this year to at<br />\nleast $500 million in 1975-6 and<br />\n$700 million by 1979-80.<br />\n,<br />\nExpansion of the State Student Incentive Grants programs is<br />\nanother major recommendation<br />\nof the Carnegie Council's report.<br />\nThe stated goal of expansion is<br />\n\"a level of combined federal-state<br />\nexpenditures adequate to meet<br />\nthe needs for low-income and<br />\nlower-middle-income students for<br />\ntuition grants by 1979-80.\"<br />\n<br />\nConnally outlines food crisis<br />\n<br />\nFerdinand Hamburger<br />\nwork was seen, the Committe invited the artists, who is from East<br />\nHampden, New York, to Baltimore to examine possible sites<br />\nand to make a proposal.<br />\n' Brown selected his site and<br />\nsubmitted his maquette, and after both were enthusiastically approved by the Committee, the<br />\nartist was officially commissioned.<br />\nThe sculpture will be one part<br />\nof the Centennial celebration<br />\nwhich includes seminars, meetings, balls, a special sumphony<br />\nwritten for the 100th anniversary<br />\nof the University, a picnic, and<br />\nvaried symposia.<br />\n<br />\nPublish or perish<br />\n<br />\nBy PATRICE GALLAGHER<br />\nThe nature and importance of<br />\nthe world food crisis was outlined Tuesday by Gerry Connally, Executive Director of the<br />\nAmerican Freedom from Hunger<br />\nFoundation.<br />\nConnally's presentation kicked<br />\noff a week of informative programs and fund-raising planned<br />\nby the Johns Hopkins Organization Against Hunger.<br />\nConnally noted that in the effort to alleviate food shortages<br />\nthere has been a \"renewed and<br />\ngrowing sophistication in terms<br />\nof public awarenss...it gives me<br />\ngreat hope.\"<br />\nHe rejected the idea that global hunger is a result of simply<br />\n\"too many mouths to feed,\"<br />\ncontending that the \"current<br />\nfood crisis has its roots directly<br />\nin events beginning in 1972.\"<br />\n\"In the early 60's, the Kennedy administration renewed interest in this problem, and...hunger became a problem we Amer-<br />\n<br />\nicans could not afford to ignore.\" solution to the problem of hunHowever, the United States, ac- ger, but believes that it is importcording to Connally, felt it had ant to end \"the political manipulto \"feed the whole world.\" '<br />\nation of countries in need of our<br />\n\"In 1972, there were real signs food aid.\"<br />\nthat that just wasn't true,\" he<br />\nHe also stated that it is importstated.

However the remaining<br />\nfifty percent were the most uncouth loutish boors that I have<br />\nseen. These people traveled in<br />\ngangs like wolves. They sat with<br />\nmuddy feet on the furniture cushions. They dropped cigarette ashes<br />\non the furniture.

It is a nonprofit organization which sells all<br />\nfood at a fifteen per cent mark up<br />\nfrom the wholesale price. Inside<br />\nthe store, there is a large poster<br />\nwhich states the purpose of the<br />\nstore. It reads: \"We are a group of<br />\nabout seventy-five people from this<br />\ncommunity who have come together to start a food co-op to serve the<br />\nentire community. Looking at the<br />\npresent situation, we see the cost<br />\nof food rising while the quality is<br />\ndeteriorating. If we want to bring<br />\nprices down, we must do it ourselves, because the food chains are<br />\nonly interested in higher profits.<br />\nOur rices are fifteen per cent above<br />\nwholesale cost. This is cover our<br />\nrent and utilities. We pay no salaries. Each of us works at least four<br />\nhours a month at a job of our own<br />\nchoice. There are no bosses. We see<br />\nthis as a type of collective effort to<br />\nbegin to solve the economic and<br />\nsocial problems that face us.\"<br />\nThe store offers a variety of<br />\ngrains, dried fruits, spices and nuts,<br />\nas well as organic eggs, clover honey and cheeses. Granola and natural peanut butter are also included<br />\nin the stock. As soon as more capital is raised (hopefully through<br />\ncontributions), the store will start<br />\nselling fresh prOduce and baked<br />\ngoods.<br />\nThe workers at Sam's Belly<br />\nopened the co-op in order to present an alternative to the rising<br />\n<br />\nfood prices found in the big food<br />\nchains. They feel that the WaverlyCharles Village community is ready<br />\nto support a store which will attempt to bring the neighborhood<br />\ncloser together while providing a<br />\nvaluable service. Once the co-op is<br />\nestablished, the workers want to<br />\nhave community meetings at the<br />\nstore and organize research on the<br />\nfood industry.<br />\nThe co-op is managed mainly by<br />\nvolunteers from the WaverlyCharles Village neighborhood.<br />\nEach volunteer works four hours a<br />\nmonth in exchange for food at a<br />\nten per cent mark up from wholesale.

His playing is an<br />\ninventive mixture of progressive<br />\nand mainstream styles, with a<br />\nhard-bop drive and an R & B soul<br />\n\u2014this mother really cooks!<br />\nJoining Harper are trumpet man<br />\nVirgil Johnson (not Marvin Peterson, as was earlier thought); guitarist Ted Dunbar (a man whose roots<br />\nare with Charlie Christian, though<br />\nhis head's with John Coltrane);<br />\ndrummer Chip Lyles (an able substitute for the originally reported<br />\nBilly Hart); and bassist Richard<br />\nDavis.<br />\nIf anything, see the concert for<br />\nRichard Davis. If there's anything<br />\n<br />\nthat can be done on bass, this cat's<br />\nthe one who can do it. The perpetual winner of downbeat, Davis can<br />\nand has played everything from<br />\nBeethoven to Stockhausen, from<br />\nSwing to Bop to Avant Garde and<br />\nbeyond. And dig this\u2014on top of all<br />\nthis, llleads a band called \"The<br />\nNew York Bass Violin Choir\"\u2014a<br />\nband of 6-8 basses.<br />\nSo come Sunday, bop on down<br />\nto The Famous Ballroom (1717<br />\nNorth Charles Street).

The<br />\nonce-burning issues of whether or not a<br />\nwoman should wear a bra or shave her<br />\nlegs have been resolved by most on the<br />\nsimple basis of personal preference. Ideologies can be as restricting as they are liberating. So, some have chosen to 'liberate'<br />\ntheir bodies, some have not. Hairy legs a<br />\nfeminist do not make.<br />\nCries from feminists for sexual liberation generated considerable opposition<br />\nat one time. Now, however,'free love' has<br />\nbecome passe. Calculations determining<br />\nthe degree of actual change in sexual attitudes shall be left to qualified sociologists. This movement for honest sexual relationships has been perversely 'Americanized' as is indicated by the advent of<br />\npublications such as 'Playgirl' and their<br />\nincreasing popularity. Evidently, certain<br />\npeople feel that women who decried their<br />\nsexploitation of centuries were merely demanding equal privileges. So, women have<br />\nbeen conferred the dubious right to enjoy<br />\nsexploitation on' an equal basis with men<br />\nin the time-honored American tradition<br />\n<br />\nas further proof of their emancipation.<br />\nMany people believe that the women's<br />\nliberation movement has made its biggest<br />\nimpact on the field of employment opportunities. However, the persistence of<br />\nquota systems and tokenism in both universities and job situations prove that<br />\nwomen have yet to be fully accepted as<br />\nequally competent members of the intellectual or working forces. Female secretaries are always in demand, yes, but toplevel positions are still predominantly<br />\nmale bastions.<br />\nWhat many fail* to realize is tilat the<br />\nworking mother is no longer an anachronism\u2014she represents an economic reality. Career women are not 'super' ambitious or 'unusually' intelligent female anomalies. They're working for the same<br />\nreasons men are, and have the same stakes<br />\nin the job game.<br />\nPerhaps this reality is ignored because<br />\nthe fallacious belief that women must<br />\nmake a choice between job and a family<br />\nis still preivalent today. The element of<br />\nchoice is quickly disappearing. Yet the<br />\nnumber of available jobs equal to many<br />\nwomen's capacities lags far behind the<br />\nnumber anxious to fill them.<br />\nWhat these 'changes' amount to, then,<br />\nis tokenism at best, and warped interpretations of the original intentions at worst,<br />\nin response to the demands of feminists<br />\nto date.<br />\nThe burning issue now is this: will<br />\nwomen accept these meaningless, symbolic gestures of 'victory', or will they<br />\nmove on towards their real goal\u2014full acceptance of woman as completely integrated, self-actualized totalities?<br />\nWomen's Liberation can no longer be<br />\n<br />\n4011111111110-<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nan end in itself. The raw material which it<br />\nprovides\u2014self-actualized women ready to<br />\ntake their place in the social scheme of<br />\nthings\u2014must be converted into a viable<br />\nsocio-political force.<br />\nSome women have taken the first<br />\nstrides towards such a conversion. Women<br />\nlike Germaine Greer, for example. Ms.<br />\nGreer epitomizes the self-actualized woman. Her brilliant discourse on \"Fertility<br />\nand Women\" revealed the many facets of<br />\nher well-integrated personality: she is<br />\nrealistic, yet compassionate, intelligently<br />\ncalculating, yet warmly human. She has<br />\nconquered the dualisms which are forced<br />\nupon women in the name of liberation\u2014<br />\nthe fallaciously forced choices between<br />\nmotherhood or a career, aggression or<br />\npassivity, superior intelligence or vacuous<br />\nstupidity.<br />\n!Manifesto<br />\nAuthoress of the feminist manifesto<br />\nThe Female Eunuch (1970), Ms. Greer<br />\nhas participated actively in the women's<br />\nmovement from its early stages to the<br />\npresent. Commening on the designation<br />\nby the United Nations of 1975 as<br />\n'International Women's Year', Ms. Greer<br />\nstated that \"...It's no surprise that the<br />\none following Population Year is International Women's Year.\" Responding to<br />\nIsaac Asimov's reported prediction that,<br />\n\"In the future, because of the population<br />\nscare, women will have to be liberated if<br />\nthey like it or not,\" Ms. Greeer exclaimed, \"Imagine turning liberation into tyranny.\"<br />\n\"Mr. Asimov and his kind are relying<br />\non the supposed anti-natalism of Women's Liberation. We are objecting to the<br />\nfact that we must be child-bearing, not<br />\n<br />\nthat we can. We object that women are<br />\npunished in this society for their child-bearing function.\u2014<br />\nArguing .that feminist demands such as<br />\nfree abortions would never have been met<br />\nunless it was politically desirable, Ms.<br />\nGreer stated that \"Women's wombs are<br />\nnot theirs to control\u2014they are regarded as<br />\na resource of the state. Women's fertility<br />\nis as much a resource as mineral<br />\ndeposits.\"<br />\nEssentially concerned with the issue of<br />\nhuman ethics and population control, Ms.<br />\nGreer expounded at length on the failure<br />\nof Western birth control methods in<br />\nThird World nations such as India. Traditional Indian methods for solving the<br />\npopulation problem, such as painless infanticide, have been replaced by the moral Western solution of death by starvation.<br />\nMs. Greer's central argument was that<br />\n\"...we cannot pre. empt these people's<br />\nchoices\u2014we will become ethically imperialistic.\"<br />\n\"There is no choice between right and<br />\nwrong in these matters. It is between<br />\nright and right, or wrong and wrong. But<br />\none cannot avoid risking his soul, and the<br />\nghastliness of moral dilemna by merely<br />\ntaking the least line of resistance. One<br />\ncannot merely obey the law.<br />\n\"The law is not a substitute for morality. At some point, we must have the<br />\ncourage to sin. We know too much\u2014after<br />\nsuch knowledge, what forgiveness?\"<br />\nGermaine Greer acts upon the courage<br />\nof her convictions, as a woman, yes, but<br />\nmore importantly, as a fully-integrated<br />\nhuman being. She has already taken the<br />\nnext step\u2014who's next?<br />\n<br />\n4r***********************<br />\n3rd annual<br />\n<br />\nMALCOLM McDOWELL<br />\nin<br />\nLindsay Anderson's<br />\n<br />\nPOUND SALE<br />\n<br />\n0 LUCKY MAN!<br />\n<br />\nHUNDREDS OF BOOKS AT $.59/1b.<br />\nor<br />\n<br />\nFRIDAY ONLY!

The<br />\nHomewood stickmen will be<br />\nlooking to present new head<br />\ncoach Henry Ciccarone with a<br />\nwin in his regular season debut<br />\nappearance as Hopkins chief<br />\nmentor.<br />\n\"Last year, on that day. Virginia was the better team and deserved to win,\" said Ciccarone in<br />\nretrospect.<br />\n\"We were lucky the score was<br />\nonly 15-10,\" he continued. \"If it<br />\nweren't for the play of goalie<br />\nMike Godack, it could have easily<br />\nbeen 25-10! They killed us on<br />\nground ball play, and really controlled the field between the<br />\nrestraining lines.\"<br />\nHopkins and Virginia went into last year's opening season contest ranked 2-3 respectively, behind Maryland. The Cavs were<br />\nled by attackman Barry Robertson's six goals, Scooter Dormey's<br />\nfour goals and two assists and<br />\nDoug Cooper's three tallies and<br />\ntwo feeds. Also Virginia dominated the face-offs 18-10 behind<br />\nmiddies Cooper and Greg Montgomery. Only Godack's 25 saves<br />\nkept the game close, as the fine<br />\nplay of the Virginia defense<br />\nstifled the vaunted Blue Jay attack, as exemplified by Jack<br />\nThomas' lone goal. Franz Wittelsberger paced the Jays in that<br />\ngame with three goals.<br />\nThis year the Cavaliers boast<br />\nanother strong team which<br />\nshould be right up there in the<br />\nmidst of the fight for this season's NCAA crown. The Wahoos<br />\nwere tied for fifth place with<br />\nNavy and Cornell in the preseason Sunpapers lacrosse poll<br />\nand have now moved up to forth.<br />\nHopkins was voted the number<br />\none position.<br />\nMATCH-UPS<br />\nJAYS ATTACK VS. VA. DEFENSE-- Defense looks to be the<br />\nstrength of this year's Charlottesville ten, while attack seems to be<br />\n<br />\nBill McCutcheon<br />\n<br />\nthe strongpoint for the Blue Jays.<br />\nThough the Wahoos lost one<br />\nof the country's top defensemen,<br />\nAll-American Boo Smith, to graduation, Coach Glenn Thiel noted<br />\nthat, \"We have four good, solid<br />\ndefensemen playing for us this<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nWillie Hazlehurst. a 6'1\". 175<br />\npound sophoinore from Wiltondale. Maryland, is . one of. the<br />\ntoughest defenseman around and<br />\nhe proved that last year when he<br />\ngave the Jays attack plenty of<br />\ntrouble as a freshman. Ed Spencer, a senior who wasn't in school<br />\nlast year and Ted Coburn, a returning senior starter, round out<br />\nthe Virginia starting defense.<br />\nScott Howe, a converted goalie,<br />\ngives the Cavs a strong fourth de-<br />\n<br />\ntouted freshman Mark Dormey<br />\n(Scooter's brother) and returnees<br />\nOwen Daly, Richie Werner and<br />\nJosh Pons provide the basis for<br />\none of the country's top midfield<br />\nunits.<br />\nMidfield will be an unproven<br />\narea for the Jays who lost, 5 topflight middies including All-Americans Rick Kowalchuk and<br />\nBilly Nolan.<br />\nCo-captain Dale Kohler, a<br />\nthird team All-American himself<br />\nlast year, joins Don Zimmerman<br />\nand Tom Myrick on the first midfield unit.<br />\nZimmerman starred scholastically at St. Paul's and then attended Randolph-Macon College before transferring to Catonsville<br />\nCommunity College, from which<br />\n<br />\nAll-American attackman Barry<br />\nRobertson, Virginia still boasts<br />\none of the country's biggest offensive threats in returning starter Scooter Dormey. This year<br />\nhowever. Dormey, last year's second leading Wahoo scorer(behind Robertson) has emphasized<br />\nhis feeding rather than his scoring. There are two reasons for<br />\nthat and their names are Bruce<br />\nBarker and Emmett Voelkel.<br />\nBarker is a big reasons for the<br />\nCavaliers explosive offensive potential. The sophomore Baltimore<br />\nnative (he graduated from Gilman) resembles Wittelsberger in<br />\nstature. He stands 6'5\", 210 and<br />\nCoach Ciccarone calls Barker,<br />\n\"one of the best true crease attackmen around.\" Barker fired in<br />\n<br />\nNEWIETrE<br />\ngports<br />\n<br />\nWahoos for the watching<br />\n<br />\nScooter Dorney<br />\nfenseman.<br />\nOn attack, despite the loss of<br />\nAll-Everything Jack Thomas, the<br />\nJays may boast the strongest unit<br />\nin the country. The mainstay of<br />\nthis trio is junior Franz Wittelsberger, All-American last year as<br />\na sophomore, and probably the<br />\nbest crease attackman in the nation. Joining Witt will be sophomore Rich Hirsch who won Honorable Mention All-American<br />\nhonors in his freshman year.<br />\nHirsch and Wittelsberger are both<br />\nplaying the best lacrosse of their<br />\ncareers so far this season.<br />\nCoach Ciccarone will probably<br />\nalternate two men at the final attack position. Last year's fourth<br />\nattackman Larry Leonard and<br />\nfreshman Mike O'Neill will be<br />\nsplitting that post.<br />\nMIDFIELD--This is the area in<br />\nwhich the Wahoos excelled in last<br />\nyear's win at Scott Stadium. As<br />\nCiccarone noted, \"They ran us<br />\ninto the ground in the midfield.\"<br />\nVirginia should be equally<br />\ntough in this area this season for<br />\nthey return seven out of their top<br />\nnine middies. Although Cooper<br />\nand Montgomery are gone, highly<br />\n<br />\nRoaney Rullman<br />\nhe graduated last year. He transferred to Hopkins this year and<br />\nsuffered a severe knee injury during fall lacrosse which required<br />\nan operation. Billed by some as<br />\nKowalchuk's replacement,<br />\nZimmerman is reportedly coming<br />\nalong fine though still playing at<br />\nonly 85% efficiency.<br />\nJim Cahill, Bill McCutcheon<br />\nand Don Kurz make-up the second line and George Johnson,<br />\nRandy Dase, and Greg Cunningham compose the final midfield<br />\ntrio.<br />\nCahill and face-off specialist<br />\nBob Maimone will be handling<br />\nthe face-offs. This is an area<br />\nwhich the Jays lost to Virginia<br />\nlast year but improved greatly as<br />\nthe season progressed. Hopkins<br />\nobviously must continue at that<br />\nlevel if they hope to be victorious<br />\non Saturday and throughout the<br />\nseason.<br />\nJHU DEFENSE VS. CA VS ATTACK\u2014This area could be the<br />\nkey to the final outcome of the<br />\ngame. Can the Hopkins defense,<br />\ndecimated by graduation and injury, control the Wahoos attack?<br />\nThough they lost first team<br />\n<br />\nOwen Daly<br />\nfour goals in Virginia's last win<br />\nover the Chesapeake Lacrosse<br />\nClub.<br />\nFreshman Voelkel is also a native Baltimorean, having played<br />\nhis scholastic lacrosse at Loyola.<br />\nVoelkel has scored six goals in<br />\nthe Cavs first two games, rounding out a potent Wahoo offense.<br />\nBeside the loss of All-American defensemen Mike Siegert and<br />\nBob Barbera to graduation, Hopkins' lone returning starter on defense Dennis Gagomiros,suffered<br />\ntorn knee ligaments and will be<br />\nlost to the Jays for at least a<br />\nmonth. Gaga was operated on<br />\nTuesday and his availability for<br />\nthe rest of the season is doubtful<br />\nat best. Coach Ciccarone and defense Coach Fred Smith have<br />\nbeen forced to rebuild the Homewood unit. They will go with<br />\nJim Moorhead, Mike Reilly (on<br />\nclose defense) and Mike Connor,<br />\na freshman who won scholastic<br />\nAll-American honors at Loyola,<br />\nas the Jays starting threesome. Of<br />\nthe trio, only Moorhead, last<br />\nyear's fourth defenseman, has<br />\nseen significant playing time,<br />\nthough Reilly saw primarily ex-<br />\n<br />\n'Franz Wittelsberger<br />\ntra-man duty last season.<br />\nGOAL--The opposing goalies,<br />\ntwo of the nation's best, are very<br />\nsimilar in style. Virginia's<br />\nRodney Rullmarr, a 5'9\", ISO<br />\npound senior and Homewood's<br />\nKevin Mahon, a sophomore who<br />\nstands 5'11\", 150, are netminders out of the same mold.<br />\nRullman could be the best goalie<br />\nin the country this year. Besides<br />\ntheir excellence in the nets, both<br />\nmen excel on clears, being fine<br />\npassers and stickhandlers, possessing great quickness and good<br />\nspeed.<br />\n\"It should be a pretty equal<br />\ngame,\" noted Cavalier Coach<br />\nThiel, \"but Hopkins' ability to<br />\nscout us these past two games, as<br />\nwell as their home field advantage should give them a slight<br />\nedge.\"<br />\nOn the other hand, Coach<br />\nCiccarone noted that Virginia has<br />\nbeen practicing almost a month<br />\nlonger than Hopkins.<br />\n\"Many schools like to get an<br />\nearly start on practice so that<br />\nthey are well prepared for the<br />\nseason,\" said Ciccarone. \"Here at<br />\nHopkins we don't like to start<br />\nthat early because we feel we<br />\ndon't need that much time plus<br />\nwe don't want our guys peaking<br />\nin mid-season. The season's long<br />\nenough, we want them peaked<br />\nfor the playoffs.\"<br />\nBesides more practice,<br />\nCiccarone noted that Virginia has<br />\ngained valuable game experience<br />\nwith two regular season wins over<br />\nWilliam & Mary and the tough<br />\nCheasapeake Lacrosse Club.<br />\n\"There's no question that our<br />\nguys remember last year and we<br />\nrespect Virginia very much. We<br />\nrespect them,\" Ciccarone concluded, \"but we don't fear<br />\nthem.\"<br />\n. .\u2022 \u2022 4Ffil<br />\n<br />\nMike Connor<br />\n<br />\n\fmarch 21, 1975/neis- s-letter/page I I<br />\n<br />\nBaseballers down CC of B, 8-6, in second scrimmage<br />\nBy ROBERT ROSENWASSER<br />\nAfter two weeks of inclement<br />\nweather, the rain finally held off<br />\nlong enough for Coach Cox and<br />\nhis diamondmen to get out on<br />\nthe field and play some ball. In<br />\ntheir second scrimmage this<br />\nSpring, the Blue Jays defeated the<br />\nCommunity College of Baltimore<br />\nby a score of 8-6.<br />\nIn what appeared to be the<br />\npossible starting nine for the Blue<br />\nJays, Coach Cox fielded (in batting order) freshman Dave Emala<br />\nin center-field, junior Lou<br />\nPodrizik at second-base, junior<br />\nTorn Pedroni at third, junior Jim<br />\nDuffy behind the plate, junior<br />\nLarry Santoro in right-field,<br />\nfreshman Frank Olszewski at<br />\n<br />\nfirst-base, sophomore Bob Babb<br />\nat shortstop, freshman Dave<br />\nLewing in left and junior John<br />\nJerabek as the designated hitter.<br />\nStint<br />\nSouthpaw Ed Chory started<br />\nthe game for the Jays and hurled<br />\nthe first four innings allowing<br />\njust two runs on four base hits.<br />\nChory appeared to have good<br />\ncontrol during his stint picking<br />\nup six strikeouts and only walking two.<br />\nDefensively, the Jays looked<br />\nsolid in the first four innings. The<br />\ninfielders didn't commit any.errors.

After Olszewski<br />\ngrounded out, Babb blasted a<br />\ntriple to deep right scoring Ron<br />\nBrown, who pinch. ran for Duffy,<br />\nand Santoro. Lewing followed<br />\nwith a double down the left field<br />\nline scoring Babb to put the Jays<br />\nout front 3-1 for good.<br />\nTallies<br />\nAlthough the Jays only managed one hit in the fourth inning,<br />\nthey came up with five tallies.<br />\nHopkins combined excellent<br />\n<br />\nMarchibroda raps<br />\n<br />\nNew Colt coach looks for stability<br />\nBy STEVE HAAS<br />\nAs another in a string of annual Baltimore Colt head coaches,<br />\nTed Marchibroda, former offensive coordinator under George<br />\nAllen in Washington, held an informal \"Rap Session\" at the<br />\nRathskellar during the evening of<br />\nMarch 19. His appearance was<br />\nthe second in the series of \"Rap<br />\nSessions\" sponsored by the<br />\nUnion Board at the Rathskellar.<br />\nMarchibroda, working for nine<br />\nyears under the Allen program,<br />\nand noted for meticulous attention to detail and unprecedented<br />\nstress on special teams, plans to<br />\ninstitute the Allen system in Baltimore. Noting that the Colts<br />\nfumbled eight punts last year,<br />\nMarchibroda claims, \"The special<br />\nteams are just as important as the<br />\noffense and defense.

The suggestion is designed to \"help private<br />\nhigher education maintain, or<br />\neven increase its share of total en-<br /><br />\nSteel sculpture to be<br />\ninstalled at library<br />\nAs part of the University's<br />\nCentennial celebration, a steel<br />\nsculpture will be installed on the<br />\nterrace wall of the Mc Library.<br />\nDr. Ferdinand Hamburger,<br />\nDirector of Centennial Planning,<br />\nrevealed that the sculpture is not<br />\nyet finished, but the project is<br />\nProceeding according to schedule.<br />\nTrustee Robert Henry Levi '37<br />\nand Ryda Hecht Levi donated<br />\nthe funds for the sculpture, to be<br />\ncreated by David Lee Brown. The<br />\nsculpture is scheduled to be installed in the summer of 1975<br />\nand will be dedicated on September 10, 1975, at eh official opening ceremony of the Centennial.<br />\nThe sculpture, five feet six inches high by eight feet wide, will<br />\nbe mounted on a six,foot pedestal straddling the terrace wall\u2014a<br />\nfew feet north of the quadrangle-side entrance to the Library.<br />\nBrown submitted his maquette, or model, of the sculpture as it will look upon completion. The piece is abstract, consisting of three-inch square tubes of<br />\nmirror-polished stainless steel several feet long. The projecting<br />\ntubes are expected to create an<br />\noverall fluid shape to convey<br />\nmovement. The artist is an 'innovator in the metal-working technique, in which stripes of steel<br />\nare bolted and welded, but nonne<br />\nof the connectives are visible<br />\nwhen the sculpture is finished.<br />\nIn describing the piece,<br />\nHamburger said, \"The intriguing<br />\nthing is that there is no front,<br />\nback, or wide. The sculpture is<br />\ninteresting from any angle viewed.\"<br />\nBrown was chosen by the<br />\nSculptor Selection Committee,<br />\nwhich was formed when the donation was made. Mrs. Levi served as chairwoman for Committee<br />\nmembers Tom Freudenheim, the<br />\ndirector of the Baltimore<br />\nMuseum of Art, Mrs. Alan<br />\nWurtzberger, who is now deceased, President Steven Muller, and<br />\nDr. Phoebe Stanton, Department<br />\nof Art History. Ex-officio -members included Dr. Hamburger and<br />\nMrs. Mary Johnson.<br />\nThe Committee-first examined<br />\nslides and brochures of available<br />\nsculpture, with the intent of purchasing an appropriate piece that<br />\nhad already been made. Eventually the Committee discareded this<br />\napproach and decided to commission a sculptor.<br />\nWhen an example of Brown's<br /><br />\nrollment.\"<br />\nThe report reads, in part: \"We<br />\nbelieve that such a program<br />\nwould be preferrable to expansion of direct institutional aid to<br />\nprivate schools'because it would<br />\ninvolve minimal interference with<br />\nprivate colleges and universities<br />\nand would enhance the principle<br />\nof student choice.\"<br />\nThe total cost of the \"tuition<br />\nequalization grants\" would approach $1.1 billion. The federal<br />\nshare Would be about $530 million the basis of 1974 enrollment<br />\nin private institutions.<br />\nThe Council also recommends<br />\nthe institution of a National Student Loan Bank to replace current student loan ,programs that<br />\nthe Council describes as bordering on \"potential disaster.\"<br />\nThe Council criticizes the present federally supported Guaranteed Loan Program because it.<br />\n\"tends to favor students whose<br />\nfamilies have good credit ratings<br />\nand high socioeconomic status.\"<br /><br />\nThe National Student Loan<br />\nBank favored by the Council<br />\nwould be a non-prat private<br />\ncorporation financed by the sale<br />\nof \"governmentally guaranteed<br />\nsecurities.\" It would be \"basically self-sustaining,\" since borrowers would repay their loatis at a<br />\nrate of at least three-fourths of<br />\none per cent of their incomes<br />\neach year for each $1000 borrowed until the loan and accrued<br />\ninterest was repaid.<br />\nAs a third major,new program,<br />\nthe Council calls for a system of<br />\nfederal financial support for large<br />\nresearch libraries. Suggested \"because financial stringency and exceptionally rapid increases in the<br />\ncost of library materials have resulted in sharp cutbacks,\" the<br />\nproposal stipulates an additional<br />\n$10 million in federal assistance<br />\nto this area.<br />\nThe federal monies would be<br />\nallocated \"on the basis of such<br />\nfactors as the number of doctoral<br />\ndegrees awarded and federal sup-<br /><br />\nport of academic science at each<br />\ninstituion.\"<br />\nThe Council also requests<br />\nthe expansion of the .

It is a nonprofit organization which sells all<br />\nfood at a fifteen per cent mark up<br />\nfrom the wholesale price. Inside<br />\nthe store, there is a large poster<br />\nwhich states the purpose of the<br />\nstore. It reads: \"We are a group of<br />\nabout seventy-five people from this<br />\ncommunity who have come together to start a food co-op to serve the<br />\nentire community. Looking at the<br />\npresent situation, we see the cost<br />\nof food rising while the quality is<br />\ndeteriorating. If we want to bring<br />\nprices down, we must do it ourselves, because the food chains are<br />\nonly interested in higher profits.<br />\nOur rices are fifteen per cent above<br />\nwholesale cost. This is cover our<br />\nrent and utilities. We pay no salaries. Each of us works at least four<br />\nhours a month at a job of our own<br />\nchoice. There are no bosses. We see<br />\nthis as a type of collective effort to<br />\nbegin to solve the economic and<br />\nsocial problems that face us.\"<br />\nThe store offers a variety of<br />\ngrains, dried fruits, spices and nuts,<br />\nas well as organic eggs, clover honey and cheeses. Granola and natural peanut butter are also included<br />\nin the stock. As soon as more capital is raised (hopefully through<br />\ncontributions), the store will start<br />\nselling fresh prOduce and baked<br />\ngoods.<br />\nThe workers at Sam's Belly<br />\nopened the co-op in order to present an alternative to the rising<br /><br />\nfood prices found in the big food<br />\nchains. They feel that the WaverlyCharles Village community is ready<br />\nto support a store which will attempt to bring the neighborhood<br />\ncloser together while providing a<br />\nvaluable service. Once the co-op is<br />\nestablished, the workers want to<br />\nhave community meetings at the<br />\nstore and organize research on the<br />\nfood industry.<br />\nThe co-op is managed mainly by<br />\nvolunteers from the WaverlyCharles Village neighborhood.<br />\nEach volunteer works four hours a<br />\nmonth in exchange for food at a<br />\nten per cent mark up from wholesale.

Mike's got<br />\na mean stick, hope he sticks it<br />\nthrough a couple of attackmen.<br />\nThis goalie Mahon he's just a punylooking sophomore. Yea, but he's<br />\ncaptain and he's a tough little bastard Franz looks bigger and more<br />\nbrutal than ever out there. Man<br />\nwhen he gets that far-off glint in<br /><br />\nbac/ knee. You know it:s almust<br />\nmore fun watching Cowan, Smith,<br /><br />\nand that little guy coach, as it is<br />\nwatching the game.

CONSIDINE<br />\nAs a follow-up to last week's article on jazz in Baltimore, the following is a run-down of some of<br />\nthe major concerts in the Monumental City in the near future.<br />\nThe Left Bank Jazz Society will<br />\npresent one of its best concerts on<br />\nSunday, 23 March. The Billy<br />\nHarper Sextet will be playing at<br />\nthe Famous Ballroom with a band<br />\nthat is as brilliant as Harper's playing.<br />\nBilly Harper is one of the msot<br />\nexciting young tenor players in the<br />\nbusiness, and is a feature member<br />\nof both the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis<br />\nBand and the Gil Evans Orchestra<br />\n(downbeat's number 1 and 2 big<br />\nbands for 1974). His playing is an<br />\ninventive mixture of progressive<br />\nand mainstream styles, with a<br />\nhard-bop drive and an R &amp; B soul<br />\n\u2014this mother really cooks!<br />\nJoining Harper are trumpet man<br />\nVirgil Johnson (not Marvin Peterson, as was earlier thought); guitarist Ted Dunbar (a man whose roots<br />\nare with Charlie Christian, though<br />\nhis head's with John Coltrane);<br />\ndrummer Chip Lyles (an able substitute for the originally reported<br />\nBilly Hart); and bassist Richard<br />\nDavis.<br />\nIf anything, see the concert for<br />\nRichard Davis. If there's anything<br /><br />\nthat can be done on bass, this cat's<br />\nthe one who can do it. The perpetual winner of downbeat, Davis can<br />\nand has played everything from<br />\nBeethoven to Stockhausen, from<br />\nSwing to Bop to Avant Garde and<br />\nbeyond. And dig this\u2014on top of all<br />\nthis, llleads a band called \"The<br />\nNew York Bass Violin Choir\"\u2014a<br />\nband of 6-8 basses.<br />\nSo come Sunday, bop on down<br />\nto The Famous Ballroom (1717<br />\nNorth Charles Street). The gig<br />\nstarts at 5 and goes to 9, and admission's $5.50.<br />\nAlso, for those of you who willl<br />\nstill be in town for Easter, there<br />\nare two excellent concerts Easter<br />\nweekend.<br />\nThe first is Jazz-Bo 75, on Saturday, 29 March. This show, at the<br />\nFifth Regiment Armoury (Howard<br />\nand Preston Streets), features the<br />\nCrusaders, sharing the bill with Gil<br />\nScott-Heron, Brian Jackson and<br />\nthe Midnight Band--and if you've<br />\nheard their latest album. I don't<br />\nhave to tell you how good that will<br />\nbe. Tickets are $6.00 in advance,<br />\nand $7.00 at the doors. and they<br />\nopen at 8:00.<br />\nEaster has Return to Forever at<br />\nPainter's Mill. Tickets for that are<br />\n$6.50, and are available at Recordmasters, and elsewhere.

The<br />\nonce-burning issues of whether or not a<br />\nwoman should wear a bra or shave her<br />\nlegs have been resolved by most on the<br />\nsimple basis of personal preference. Ideologies can be as restricting as they are liberating. So, some have chosen to 'liberate'<br />\ntheir bodies, some have not. Hairy legs a<br />\nfeminist do not make.<br />\nCries from feminists for sexual liberation generated considerable opposition<br />\nat one time. Now, however,'free love' has<br />\nbecome passe. Calculations determining<br />\nthe degree of actual change in sexual attitudes shall be left to qualified sociologists. This movement for honest sexual relationships has been perversely 'Americanized' as is indicated by the advent of<br />\npublications such as 'Playgirl' and their<br />\nincreasing popularity. Evidently, certain<br />\npeople feel that women who decried their<br />\nsexploitation of centuries were merely demanding equal privileges. So, women have<br />\nbeen conferred the dubious right to enjoy<br />\nsexploitation on' an equal basis with men<br />\nin the time-honored American tradition<br /><br />\nas further proof of their emancipation.<br />\nMany people believe that the women's<br />\nliberation movement has made its biggest<br />\nimpact on the field of employment opportunities. However, the persistence of<br />\nquota systems and tokenism in both universities and job situations prove that<br />\nwomen have yet to be fully accepted as<br />\nequally competent members of the intellectual or working forces. Female secretaries are always in demand, yes, but toplevel positions are still predominantly<br />\nmale bastions.<br />\nWhat many fail* to realize is tilat the<br />\nworking mother is no longer an anachronism\u2014she represents an economic reality. Career women are not 'super' ambitious or 'unusually' intelligent female anomalies. They're working for the same<br />\nreasons men are, and have the same stakes<br />\nin the job game.<br />\nPerhaps this reality is ignored because<br />\nthe fallacious belief that women must<br />\nmake a choice between job and a family<br />\nis still preivalent today. The element of<br />\nchoice is quickly disappearing. Yet the<br />\nnumber of available jobs equal to many<br />\nwomen's capacities lags far behind the<br />\nnumber anxious to fill them.<br />\nWhat these 'changes' amount to, then,<br />\nis tokenism at best, and warped interpretations of the original intentions at worst,<br />\nin response to the demands of feminists<br />\nto date.<br />\nThe burning issue now is this: will<br />\nwomen accept these meaningless, symbolic gestures of 'victory', or will they<br />\nmove on towards their real goal\u2014full acceptance of woman as completely integrated, self-actualized totalities?<br />\nWomen's Liberation can no longer be<br /><br />\n4011111111110-<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nan end in itself. The raw material which it<br />\nprovides\u2014self-actualized women ready to<br />\ntake their place in the social scheme of<br />\nthings\u2014must be converted into a viable<br />\nsocio-political force.<br />\nSome women have taken the first<br />\nstrides towards such a conversion. Women<br />\nlike Germaine Greer, for example. Ms.<br />\nGreer epitomizes the self-actualized woman. Her brilliant discourse on \"Fertility<br />\nand Women\" revealed the many facets of<br />\nher well-integrated personality: she is<br />\nrealistic, yet compassionate, intelligently<br />\ncalculating, yet warmly human. She has<br />\nconquered the dualisms which are forced<br />\nupon women in the name of liberation\u2014<br />\nthe fallaciously forced choices between<br />\nmotherhood or a career, aggression or<br />\npassivity, superior intelligence or vacuous<br />\nstupidity.<br />\n!Manifesto<br />\nAuthoress of the feminist manifesto<br />\nThe Female Eunuch (1970), Ms. Greer<br />\nhas participated actively in the women's<br />\nmovement from its early stages to the<br />\npresent. Commening on the designation<br />\nby the United Nations of 1975 as<br />\n'International Women's Year', Ms. Greer<br />\nstated that \"...It's no surprise that the<br />\none following Population Year is International Women's Year.\" Responding to<br />\nIsaac Asimov's reported prediction that,<br />\n\"In the future, because of the population<br />\nscare, women will have to be liberated if<br />\nthey like it or not,\" Ms. Greeer exclaimed, \"Imagine turning liberation into tyranny.\"<br />\n\"Mr. Asimov and his kind are relying<br />\non the supposed anti-natalism of Women's Liberation. We are objecting to the<br />\nfact that we must be child-bearing, not<br /><br />\nthat we can. We object that women are<br />\npunished in this society for their child-bearing function.\u2014<br />\nArguing .that feminist demands such as<br />\nfree abortions would never have been met<br />\nunless it was politically desirable, Ms.<br />\nGreer stated that \"Women's wombs are<br />\nnot theirs to control\u2014they are regarded as<br />\na resource of the state. Women's fertility<br />\nis as much a resource as mineral<br />\ndeposits.\"<br />\nEssentially concerned with the issue of<br />\nhuman ethics and population control, Ms.<br />\nGreer expounded at length on the failure<br />\nof Western birth control methods in<br />\nThird World nations such as India. Traditional Indian methods for solving the<br />\npopulation problem, such as painless infanticide, have been replaced by the moral Western solution of death by starvation.<br />\nMs. Greer's central argument was that<br />\n\"...we cannot pre. empt these people's<br />\nchoices\u2014we will become ethically imperialistic.\"<br />\n\"There is no choice between right and<br />\nwrong in these matters. It is between<br />\nright and right, or wrong and wrong. But<br />\none cannot avoid risking his soul, and the<br />\nghastliness of moral dilemna by merely<br />\ntaking the least line of resistance. One<br />\ncannot merely obey the law.<br />\n\"The law is not a substitute for morality. At some point, we must have the<br />\ncourage to sin. We know too much\u2014after<br />\nsuch knowledge, what forgiveness?\"<br />\nGermaine Greer acts upon the courage<br />\nof her convictions, as a woman, yes, but<br />\nmore importantly, as a fully-integrated<br />\nhuman being.

The<br />\nHomewood stickmen will be<br />\nlooking to present new head<br />\ncoach Henry Ciccarone with a<br />\nwin in his regular season debut<br />\nappearance as Hopkins chief<br />\nmentor.<br />\n\"Last year, on that day. Virginia was the better team and deserved to win,\" said Ciccarone in<br />\nretrospect.<br />\n\"We were lucky the score was<br />\nonly 15-10,\" he continued. \"If it<br />\nweren't for the play of goalie<br />\nMike Godack, it could have easily<br />\nbeen 25-10! They killed us on<br />\nground ball play, and really controlled the field between the<br />\nrestraining lines.\"<br />\nHopkins and Virginia went into last year's opening season contest ranked 2-3 respectively, behind Maryland. The Cavs were<br />\nled by attackman Barry Robertson's six goals, Scooter Dormey's<br />\nfour goals and two assists and<br />\nDoug Cooper's three tallies and<br />\ntwo feeds. Also Virginia dominated the face-offs 18-10 behind<br />\nmiddies Cooper and Greg Montgomery. Only Godack's 25 saves<br />\nkept the game close, as the fine<br />\nplay of the Virginia defense<br />\nstifled the vaunted Blue Jay attack, as exemplified by Jack<br />\nThomas' lone goal. Franz Wittelsberger paced the Jays in that<br />\ngame with three goals.<br />\nThis year the Cavaliers boast<br />\nanother strong team which<br />\nshould be right up there in the<br />\nmidst of the fight for this season's NCAA crown. The Wahoos<br />\nwere tied for fifth place with<br />\nNavy and Cornell in the preseason Sunpapers lacrosse poll<br />\nand have now moved up to forth.<br />\nHopkins was voted the number<br />\none position.<br />\nMATCH-UPS<br />\nJAYS ATTACK VS. VA. DEFENSE-- Defense looks to be the<br />\nstrength of this year's Charlottesville ten, while attack seems to be<br /><br />\nBill McCutcheon<br /><br />\nthe strongpoint for the Blue Jays.<br />\nThough the Wahoos lost one<br />\nof the country's top defensemen,<br />\nAll-American Boo Smith, to graduation, Coach Glenn Thiel noted<br />\nthat, \"We have four good, solid<br />\ndefensemen playing for us this<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nWillie Hazlehurst. a 6'1\". 175<br />\npound sophoinore from Wiltondale. Maryland, is . one of. the<br />\ntoughest defenseman around and<br />\nhe proved that last year when he<br />\ngave the Jays attack plenty of<br />\ntrouble as a freshman. Ed Spencer, a senior who wasn't in school<br />\nlast year and Ted Coburn, a returning senior starter, round out<br />\nthe Virginia starting defense.<br />\nScott Howe, a converted goalie,<br />\ngives the Cavs a strong fourth de-<br /><br />\ntouted freshman Mark Dormey<br />\n(Scooter's brother) and returnees<br />\nOwen Daly, Richie Werner and<br />\nJosh Pons provide the basis for<br />\none of the country's top midfield<br />\nunits.<br />\nMidfield will be an unproven<br />\narea for the Jays who lost, 5 topflight middies including All-Americans Rick Kowalchuk and<br />\nBilly Nolan.<br />\nCo-captain Dale Kohler, a<br />\nthird team All-American himself<br />\nlast year, joins Don Zimmerman<br />\nand Tom Myrick on the first midfield unit.<br />\nZimmerman starred scholastically at St. Paul's and then attended Randolph-Macon College before transferring to Catonsville<br />\nCommunity College, from which<br /><br />\nAll-American attackman Barry<br />\nRobertson, Virginia still boasts<br />\none of the country's biggest offensive threats in returning starter Scooter Dormey. This year<br />\nhowever. Dormey, last year's second leading Wahoo scorer(behind Robertson) has emphasized<br />\nhis feeding rather than his scoring. There are two reasons for<br />\nthat and their names are Bruce<br />\nBarker and Emmett Voelkel.<br />\nBarker is a big reasons for the<br />\nCavaliers explosive offensive potential. The sophomore Baltimore<br />\nnative (he graduated from Gilman) resembles Wittelsberger in<br />\nstature. He stands 6'5\", 210 and<br />\nCoach Ciccarone calls Barker,<br />\n\"one of the best true crease attackmen around.\" Barker fired in<br /><br />\nNEWIETrE<br />\ngports<br /><br />\nWahoos for the watching<br /><br />\nScooter Dorney<br />\nfenseman.<br />\nOn attack, despite the loss of<br />\nAll-Everything Jack Thomas, the<br />\nJays may boast the strongest unit<br />\nin the country. The mainstay of<br />\nthis trio is junior Franz Wittelsberger, All-American last year as<br />\na sophomore, and probably the<br />\nbest crease attackman in the nation.
