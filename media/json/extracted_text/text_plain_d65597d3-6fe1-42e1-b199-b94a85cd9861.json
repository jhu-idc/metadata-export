During a series of Senate Committee<br />\nhearings, a stream of scientists testified that the worth of<br />\nthe system sould not be determined due to the ban on<br />\nnuclear testing in the atmosphere. Thus, the Nixon<br />\nadministration has proposed a missile system about<br />\nWhich nothing is known, except what it is supposed to<br />\ndo.<br />\nDr. Stephen Ambrose, Hopkins military historian,<br />\nquestions whether the system is necessary since the<br />\nUnited States has the ability to destroy the Soviet Union<br />\n(or China)several times over from various vantage points<br />\nthroughout the world. With approximately one thousand<br />\ni ntercontinental ballistic missiles, countless B-52<br />\nbombers, and about 40 polaris submarines (each carrying<br />\nsixteen missiles) constantly prepared to attack the<br />\ncommunists, Dr. Ambrose thinks that \"our ability, to<br />\nretaliate is not in jeopardy.\"<br />\nThe question of the use of the Sentinel system as a<br />\ndeterrent to nuclear war has been brought forth both in<br />\nthe Congress and by faculty members. Senator John<br />\nSherman Cooper, (R-Ky.), lamented after the decision,<br />\nthat the President had \"an opportunity that perhaps no<br />\nOther President had before him.. .the chance to halt the<br />\nnuclear arms race.\"<br />\nLess Provocative<br />\nThere is doubt that the Russians will respond in a<br />\nstrong manner. Dr. Robert Slusser, professor of Russian<br />\nhistory, feels that Mr. Nixon proposed a system that is<br />\nless provocative than any other form of the ABM. He<br />\nwent on to say that the Soviet Union would not alter its<br />\nTeed of arms build up as a result of the establishment of<br />\nthe ABM.<br />\nSenator Phillip Hart, Michigan Democrat, claimed<br />\nthat the \"two systems (Sentinel and the Maginot Line)<br />\nWill prove about equally effective in guaranteeing<br />\nPeace,\" in response to claims that the ABM would<br />\nprevent nuclear war.<br />\nIn presenting the limited system, Mr. Nixon said<br />\nthat, \"The U.S. must take steps now to insure that our<br />\nstrategic retaliatory forces will not become vulnerable.\"<br />\nContrary to this point of view, Dr. Robert Rothstein,<br />\nHoykins political scientist, feels that \"the argument that<br />\ntiUS (the ABM) protects us against a Soviet attack is<br />\nfatuous.\"<br />\nDr. Rothstein goes on to critisize the ABM in<br />\nsaYlng that \"the ABM might not alter the strategic<br />\nbalance, but rather raise the level of force within it.\" He<br />\n<br />\ncontinued, \"there is no reason to believe that some form<br />\nof ABM might,in the future, make some sense.\"<br />\nMetropolitan Montana<br />\nHe felt that the system was reasonable only if an<br />\nagreement with the Soviet Union to halt the build up of<br />\narms could be reached while the ABM is being<br />\nconstructed.<br />\n\"If an accident did occur,\" Dr. Rothstein said, \"it<br />\n(the ABM) might be able to prevent disaster.\" This<br />\nwould be possible only if the system covered the entire<br />\ncountry. With the limited system proposed by Nixon the<br />\n\"metropolitan areas of North Dakota and Montana\" will<br />\nbe protected.<br />\nThe question of why Mr. Nixon asked Congress for<br />\nof missile bases rather than major cities is<br />\nprotection<br />\nthe<br />\nopen to debate. The consensus of opinion is that a<br />\nlimited _system of the type Nixon put forth has the best<br />\nchance of getting through Congress.<br />\nThe President was pressured by the Pentagon to<br />\nsupport the system and by senate liberals to dispose of<br />\nthe plan. He compromised and appeased both parties.<br />\nDr. Slusser claimed that \"The new administration is<br />\nbehaving in a fairly shrewd manner.\"<br />\nPolitical Decision<br />\nDr. Rothstein said that, \"Everybody in<br />\nWashington thinks that this is a political decision, and<br />\nhas no strategic base.\" Dr. Robert L. Peabody, Hopkins<br />\nprofessor of political science, felt that the protection of<br />\nthe cities was eliminated because opposition to the<br />\nprogram revolved around this factor.<br />\nThe pentagon is especially pleased with the<br />\ndecision to protect its military bases. Members of the<br />\nJoint Chiefs of Staff recently reduced their request for a<br />\nhard ABM and what they got from the President falls<br />\ninto their plans well.<br />\nDr. Peabody, an authority on legislative processes<br />\nsaid that the limited system will stand a good chance of<br />\ngaining full support, with no reductions in<br />\nappropriations, because it will be presented in small<br />\nportions over the course of several years.<br />\nHe said that the projected total cost of six to eight<br />\nbillion dollars will probably fall short of the final cost,<br />\nand thus cause some scrutinization of the entire<br />\nDepartment of Defense budget. However, Dr. Peabody<br />\ndid not think that the increased study would cause more<br />\nthan minor reductions in the departments<br />\nappropriations.<br />\nDr. Peabody indicated that the added cost of the<br />\nSentinel system might cause reduction in money<br />\napportioned to domestic programs. This would create a<br />\ngreater cut in these programs than already has been<br />\nproposed by the efficiency-oriented Nixon<br />\nadministration.<br />\n<br />\nDR.

Dr. William Bevan, Vice<br />\nPresident and chairman of the ad hoc Committee,<br />\nexplained that the \"mini-semester\" would be for<br />\nindependent study, study abroad, work experience and<br />\ngeneral \"educational innovation.\" Many professors said a<br />\nfour-week program was not suitable to the framework of<br />\ntheir departments, especially in the sciences. Dean Carl<br />\nSwanson said in reply to a question, \"In the biology<br />\ndepartment, at least, it will be hard to figure out a<br />\n\"mini-semester\" program.\" Some faculty members<br />\nthought the plan was completely unrealistic for large<br />\nlecture classes, while others wanted to know if the<br />\nincreased work during this four-week period would<br />\naugment their salary.<br />\nThe tone of the Assembly was quickly established<br />\nby the first motion of the meeting\u2014it asked that all<br />\npersons present who are not faculty members be asked<br />\nto leave. The author of the motion, Dr. Martin Larrabee<br />\nof the Biophysics Department, was quickly challenged<br />\nby Chairman Lincoln Gordon. \"There are no rules that<br />\nforbid spectators in the galleries,\" the President<br />\nexplained. \"And I don't see anything about the nature<br />\nof these issues that demands secrecy.\" Larrabee's<br />\nmotion, after further discussion, was defeated.<br />\nIn another attempted revolt from the proceedings,<br />\n<br />\nl'<br />\n, <1<br />\n<br />\n4t<br />\n<br />\nDr. George Owen, chairman of physics, stated, \"I insist<br />\nthat the faculty really should run itself. I make the<br />\nmotion that the faculty take over the discussion.\" An<br />\nargument by several professors followed this motion.<br />\nOne called the Owen proposal another \"delaying tactic,\"<br />\nand said the opponents of calendar reform wanted to<br />\nmake this a \"rump meeting.\" The motion was soon<br />\nrejected.<br />\nMidway through the proceedings, Russ Passarella<br />\nspoke to the faculty. He said that the main studeht<br />\nobjections to the present system were that school begins<br />\ntoo late in the fall, Christmas is not a \"real\" vacation,<br />\nJanuary is a \"dead month,\" the second semester ends<br />\ntoo late, and that there is no opportunity to concentrate<br />\nin one subject area.<br />\nHe noted that of the 52% who voted in the<br />\nStudent Council's calendar referendum, 95% of the<br />\nstudents supported 4-1-4. \"It would be greatly<br />\nfrustrating to see this issue bogged down,\" Passarella<br />\nstated. \"4-1-4 embodies all the old complaints and<br />\nanswers our educational desires.\" John Ferchak,<br />\nspeaking for the graduates, said that the graduate<br />\ndelegates, representing 16 of the 23 departments at<br />\nHomewood, voted 15-1 for calendar reform . in an<br />\ninformal poll.<br />\nIn the question period after Passarella's speech, Dr.<br />\nRobert W. Tucker of the political science department.<br />\ndeclared, \"This is not just calendar reform. It is<br />\neducational reform....The `mini-semester' is very vague,<br />\nand, if worked out, would be a major change.\" Later,<br />\nDr. Carl Christ, professor of economics, suggested an<br />\nadditional calendar plan, a 11-11-11 trimester system.,<br />\nThis was quickly rejected as too major a change.<br />\nThrough the separate proposals of Dr. Ferdinand<br />\nHamburger, chairman of the electrial engineering<br />\ndepartment, and Dr. William McElroy of biology,<br />\nanother proposal was devised into Plan C.

Due to the distinct possibility of<br />\ncut back in available funding from the<br />\nUniversity, Jim Cleary, head of the<br />\ntutorial project, stated that the grant was<br />\nextremely important.<br />\nThe tutorial program presently includes<br />\nabout:130 Hopkins students and 175 high school<br />\nstudents. Each has been assigned a tutee, bringing<br />\nthe total number of people involved in the actual<br />\nprogram to over 600 individuals. Mrs. Lynn<br />\nKagan, director of the program, stated that the<br />\nprogram \"needs better materials and more<br />\nspecifically trained help. We desperately need<br />\nsomeone to coordinate activities.\"<br />\nAlthough the City Council's role in matters<br />\ndealing with procurement of \"outside<br />\nfunds\"--the 0E0 grant is solely federal<br />\nfunding\u2014is purely advisory, the decision is<br />\nexpected to have significant impact in<br />\nWashington. The general chances for the<br />\nrequest's success are slim, according to Mrs.<br />\nKagen.<br />\nJudiciary Rejects<br />\nLast Monday the Council Judiciary<br />\nCommittee turned down the proposal in the<br />\n<br />\nform of a 10-7 vote. The head of the Judiciary<br />\nCommittee, Councilman Reubin Kaplan, stressed<br />\nthe fact that the Tutorial Project \"is and always<br />\nhas been\" a voluntary organization. He<br />\ncontinued by saying that he saw no need to \"give<br />\nit money which would only bog it down in an<br />\nadministrative mess.\"<br />\nKaplan based his opinion on the<br />\ncontention that the money \"would only create<br />\njobs.\" He feels that the program has been<br />\nprogressing satisfactorily and that \"those<br />\nvolunteers don't need any more money.\"<br />\nAlthough the 0E0 appropriation would<br />\ncost neither Baltimore nor Maryland any extra<br />\nexpense, Mr. Kaplan adamantly refused to<br />\n\"waste\" the taxpayer's money. The financial<br />\nconsiderations,; do not appear to have been<br />\npredominant in the Councilman's mind, however.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that, at the same meeting,<br />\nthe Druid Hill Avenue Youth Training Center<br />\nwas given economic help and a similar bill,<br />\ninvolving an expendure of $62,500 for the Aid<br />\nfor the Elderly was sent back to committee.<br />\nThe Community Action Agency (CAA)<br />\nwhich is working closely with the tutorial<br />\nprogram, are now planning to go to Washington<br />\nin the hopes of gaining support for the 0E0<br />\ngrant. The general impression is not, however,<br />\noptimistic. They fear that the 0E0 will argue<br />\nthat if Baltimore doesn't care for the tutorial<br />\nproject then the Federal Government should not<br />\nprovide funds. James Farmer, Undersecretary of<br />\nHEW may intercede, however. He announced his<br />\ndecision to support the Tutorial project at a press<br />\nconference after his talk at Hopkins. Farmer was<br />\na guest speaker for Dr. John Owen's course,\"The<br />\nEconomics of Poverty.\"<br />\n<br />\nTo Communicate'<br />\n<br />\ncommittee on<br />\nVICE PRESIDENT Dr. William Bevan headed the ad hoc<br />\ncalendar reform which first recommended 4-1-4.<br />\n<br />\nThe controversy over Levering Hall has drawn<br />\nconflicting opinions from many of the main people who<br />\nhave been involved in the three-way negotiations between<br />\nthe Baltimore YMCA,the University and Levering Hall.<br />\nDr. Partridge and Dean Kimball summarized the<br />\nadministration's point of view about the confusion of the<br />\npast two months and about the future of Levering Hall.<br />\nDr. Partridge claimed that the confusion about . the<br />\nUniversity's assumption of the Levering budget was not<br />\nthe result of purposeful deceit but simply the result of a<br />\nlack of communication and a breakdown of the chain of<br />\ncommand.<br />\nWith regard to the future of Levering Hall and the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice, he said that as of July 1, 1969, his office will have nothing<br />\nmore to do with the problem. He stated that Mr. Bilgrave's office<br />\nwill be in charge of the Levering programs and will be responsible for<br />\nhandling the Levering and Chaplain's budget.<br />\nDean Kimball shared the views of Dr. Partridge arguing that<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office and Levering were student affairs and belonged<br />\nunder the control of the Office of Student Affairs. He said that there<br />\nwere really no long range problems because the questions of status<br />\nand future budget for the Chaplain's Office had already been<br />\ndecided. The status of the Chaplain's office would be that of anY<br />\nother student organization on campus and the budget would be<br />\napproved yearly by the regular University chain of command.<br />\nDr. Gryder, chairman of the Levering Board of Managers, was<br />\nnot willing to admit that major problems did not still exist. He said<br />\nthat the three proposals which had been sent to Dean Kimball<br />\nconcerning the status of the Chaplain were crucial to the Levering<br />\nprogram. He said that chaplains' offices at schools like Yale,<br />\nDartmouth, Howard, Middlebury and Stanford all reported directlY<br />\nto the president's office.

The Board wanted to<br />\nbase the budget on the actual expenditures of the second<br />\nhalf of 1968 rather than on the proposed expenditures<br />\nof the same period because the new Levering programs<br />\ndemended extra money if they were to be continued.<br />\nAt a second meeting, on January 29th, this group<br />\nworked out a tentative budget for the first half of 1969<br />\nwhich included requests for more than $27,000. This<br />\nrepresented a reduction of $3000 from the amount that<br />\nwas spent during the second half of 1968. This budget<br />\nwas given to Mr. Bilgrave who, in turn, submitted it to<br />\nDr. Partridge. Thus, the Board of Managers felt that the<br />\nbudget problems were settled for the present.<br />\nEarlier in January, the Board of Managers also<br />\nattempted to deal with the problem of the status of the<br />\nChaplain's Office. In a proposal sent to Dean Kimball on<br />\nJanuary 14th, the Board recommended that Chaplain<br />\nreport to the President or Provost that the Chaplain be<br />\ngiven tenure and that he have a board of student and<br />\nfaculty advisors. The Board felt that this proposal would<br />\nsolve the problem of Levering's status.<br />\nHowever, neither of the problems were solved in<br />\nfact. Dr. Partridge claimed that the budget submitted by<br />\nthe January 20th group was written on YMCA forms<br />\nrather than Hopkins forms and so he couldn't<br />\nunderstand them. He returned the forms to Mr.<br />\nBilgrave's office and then began writing to the Board of<br />\nManagers saying that he had received no budget.<br />\nAt the same time, Dean Kimball claimed that he<br />\nhad never seen the three proposals which were sent to<br />\nhim concerning the status of the Office of the Chaplain.<br />\nThroughout this period of'confusion and denials<br />\nLevering Hall continually tried to arrange meetings with<br />\nUniversity officials and Dr. Bevan tried to bring the<br />\nvarious groups together, but no meetings took place.<br />\n. Finally, on March 17th, Dr. Partridge met with Dr.<br />\nWickwire, Dr. Gryder, Mr. Bilgrave, Mr. Guerdon, Mr.<br />\nHughes and Joe Weinberg, former president of the<br />\nStudent Association. At this meeting, Dr. Partridge tried<br />\nto. straighten out the budget issue and indicted Dr.<br />\nWickwire for failing to submit a budget and for failure to<br />\nmeet and clear up the budget problems. After heated<br />\narguments on both sides, a tentative agreement was<br />\nreached and both YMCA and the University pledged<br />\nmore money to Levering. In return, Dr. Wickwire<br />\nPromised to review the proposed budget, which Mr.<br />\n1311grave's office had finally resubmitted, and cut it<br />\nWhere ever possible.<br />\nJOHN P.

The petition calls.<br />\nfor the reorganization of the course in<br />\norder to teach \"the basic elements of<br />\nthe second semester course in the short<br />\ntime remaining.\" It asks for more<br />\nconferences, even at the expense of the<br />\nlabs, which are \"irrelevant to the<br />\ncourse.\" A request is also made to have<br />\nhomework returned before the tests<br />\nwith a sheet demonstrating the correct<br />\n<br />\nprocedure for the solution. Another<br />\ndemand is to have the lectures replaced<br />\nby small conferences, which would go<br />\nbetter suited to the material. A request<br />\nwas made for a \"general review of the<br />\nquality of its (Chemistry's)introductory<br />\ncourses,\" and consultation of the<br />\ndepartment with the students in all final<br />\ndecisions.<br />\nLogan to Swanson to Koski<br />\nLipsey and Weinburg decided to<br />\ntake action after the books for the<br />\nsecond semester had not arrived by<br />\nMarch 7, only a week before the first<br />\ntest. They went to Mr. Logan, the<br />\nfreshman advisor, who advised them to<br />\nsee Dean Swanson. Swanson suggested<br />\nthat they prepare a petition of their<br />\ngrievances for presentation to Dr.<br />\nGordon. Finally, it was decided that the<br />\npetition should be submitted to Dr.<br />\nKoski. Dr. Koski responded to the<br />\npetition by calling a Wednesday<br />\nconference to include Lipsey, Weinburg,<br />\nDr. Cowan, Dr. Gryder, Dr. Paar, and<br />\nDr. Koski, to discuss the student<br />\ngrievances.<br />\nAmong the problems noted by the<br />\nstudents were the poor quality of the<br />\nconferences, the failure of the section<br />\nleaders to hand back assignments before<br />\nthe tests, and books and lectures which<br />\nare \"incomprehensible.\" The number of<br />\ndrops between the semesters this year<br />\nwas nearly twice the number in the last<br />\ntwo years, reflecting a serious deficiency<br />\nin the course. The main complaint is<br />\nthat the students aren't being taught<br />\n<br />\nanything. \"What we did last semester<br />\nwas done at Brown in two weeks,\"<br />\nWeinberg observed. \"I would think that<br />\na university which is as strong as<br />\nHopkins is supposed to be in chemistry,<br />\nwould be able to offer its<br />\nundergraduates more than it has,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nMuch of the controversy<br />\nsurrounds the text, written by Dr.<br />\nCowan, which is being used for the first<br />\ntime this year. The book, \"hastily<br />\nwritten,\" has a number of sections<br />\nwhich \"have been copied from other<br />\nbooks as evidenced by differing type<br />\ncharacters,\" charged Weinberg. The<br />\nbook also has a large number of<br />\nmathematical errors. Students feel that<br />\nalthough there is no math requirement<br />\nfor introduction chemistry, it is almost<br />\nimpossible to understand the derivations<br />\nwithout a knowledge of calculus.<br />\nGuesses and Intuition<br />\nComplaints have also been made<br />\nabout the lack of scientific rigor in the<br />\ncomposition of the book. This is<br />\ndemonstrated by statements as,<br />\n\"Intuition tells us a great deal about<br />\nB.\". \"A is an integration constant we<br />\ncan get rid of.\", and \"We now want to<br />\nguess the form of the functional<br />\nrelationship.\" Characteristic of the<br />\nprose style of the book is the sentence,<br />\n\"Although from an aesthetic point of<br />\nview semiempirical theory may not be<br />\nas satisfying as ab initio theory, it is<br />\nnevertheless an extremely fruitful way<br />\nto attack the problem.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe book was defended by Dr.<br />\nPaar, the chairman of the department<br />\nfor next year, as a possible \"step<br />\nforward in chemical education because<br />\nit employs a modern approach to<br />\nchemistry which is relatively severe in<br />\norder to challenge students in<br />\nappropriate places.\" He also pointed out<br />\nthat it was \"not as quantitative but<br />\nmore conceptual than the<br />\nKokes-Andrews book,\" which it<br />\nreplaces.<br />\nOrganic Next<br />\nThe students also hoped that their<br />\nconference with the chemistry faculty<br />\nwould spur change in the organic<br />\nchemistry course which many of them<br />\nwill be taking next year. The text for<br />\norganic has been characterized by a<br />\nstudent presently enrolled in the course<br />\nas \"trivial information which doesn t<br />\nexplain anything.\" The lectures are<br />\n\"poorly attended and boring with Dr.<br />\nCorwin often lapsing into irrelevant<br />\npersonal rememberances.\" The tests<br />\ncover \"trivialities which you try to<br />\nforget as soon as the test is over.\" The<br />\nstudents' immediate concern, however,<br />\nis, with the freshman course in which<br />\nthey are presently \"confined.\"<br />\nHELP!!!!<br />\nWriters are needed to work on<br />\nthe sports staff of the News-Letter.

The principal topics of dispute are the<br />\nLevering budget and its status in the University structure. The only point<br />\n\u00b0I\u2018 contention which seems to be solved at this date is that the University<br />\n'las arranged to see that Levering's budgetary committments for January<br />\nto June, 1969; are met.<br />\nWe urge that Hopkins administrators adopt two courses of action:<br />\nthat Levering's request to be placed directly under the President's Office<br />\nbe approved, and that every consideration be given to Levering's budget<br />\nrequests for 1969-70.<br />\nLevering's programs\u2014tutoring, AWARE, movies, to name a few\u2014are<br />\nth most<br />\n,e<br />\nambitious and far-reaching activities of any organization on the<br />\nuomewood campus. The business flowing through the offices of Levering<br />\nClosely rivals that of the Office of Student Affairs, itself. The importance<br />\nof Levering's programs demand that they be allowed to continue at their<br />\nPresent level with sufficient room for expansion.<br />\nTo place an organization as large as Levering under the jurisdiction<br />\nof the Office of Student Affairs is ludicrous.

Levering's past record shows that its<br />\nefforts on Homewood and in the city have been creative, productive and<br />\nwell worth the funds it has received\u2014more than can be said for other<br />\ncampus groups.<br />\nIn short, we have complete faith in Dr. Wickwire, the Levering<br />\nBoard of Managers, and the student directors of the Student Association.<br />\nWe feel that their proposals concerning the future of Levering Hall should<br />\nbe approved.<br />\n<br />\n...<br />\n<br />\nContinue<br />\n<br />\nThe City Council's decision to withhold approval of the Community<br />\nAction Agency's request for Federal aid again points up the strange<br />\nrelationship between the people and their elected representatives. Instead<br />\nof funding the Tutorial Project, a clearly responsible and highly successful<br />\noperation, the Council has reduced itself to political maneuvering of the<br />\nlowest and most contemptible order. Instead of serving the needs of the<br />\npeople of Baltimore, Councilman Kaplan's committee has seen fit to assert<br />\nits power over the \"defenseless\" groups in the city\u2014the Blacks and the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nKaplan, moreover, has the audacity, in this age of astronomical<br />\ngovernment spending to emphasize the need for \"holding the line\" on the<br />\nTutorial's request for $64,000 to continue a program aimed at combatting<br />\nthe disadvantaged educational status of deprived Baltimore students.<br />\nMoreover, the funds in question will be eventually allocated anyway, and<br />\nit is regrettable that the Council has bypassed an opportunity to put the<br />\nmoney to productive use in Baltimore.<br />\nIn no way do Kaplan's arguments make sense. Even with the 0E0<br />\nmoney, the Tutorial will be run as inexpensively as possible. It enables<br />\nstudent energy to be used productively and builds rapport between<br />\nhitherto antagonistic elements - white middle class students and Inner City<br />\nblacks. We think these are worthwhile goals. Does Mr. Kaplan?<br />\nWe urge Dr. Gordon and other concerned officials to immediately<br />\nmobilize whatever influence they can to ensure that the S.A.

If the<br />\nUniversity is truly interested in helping to attack urban ills, as it has<br />\nprofessed to be in the past, it is imperative that it intervene in this<br />\nsituation to assure the survival of a program which we feel is crucial to the<br />\neducational interests of the city.<br />\n<br />\nPOT FF-01<br />\n)<br />\nt,c<br />\nARE AL-tk-AYs<br />\nlaye ME<br />\nNC iv<br />\nCA<br />\nVE<br />\nEVERYTHIMO_<br />\n<br />\nAND 1HAT<br />\nHAVE<br />\nTO SETife<br />\nFCR LESS-<br />\n<br />\nI WOOL-MT<br />\nMUD Se-mm.)3<br />\n<br />\nIFI 0-0WA)r<br />\nOS MOST<br />\n<br />\nFOR i,ES5<br />\n<br />\nEV<br />\n'<br />\n6961 alt3IPLIAS lititsmistiqnd .10<br />\n<br />\nAs students, we would like to thank and commend those who<br />\nattended last Friday's General Assembly meeting for approving calendar<br />\nreform.

In the Parliaments of England, France, Belgium<br />\nand Italy, and in the Japanese Diet, it was reported that<br />\nAmerica's war plans included a provision for packing off<br />\nall domestic \"subversives\" to concentration camps.<br />\nThe extensive discussions were touched off by an<br />\narticle in the Sept. 13, 1952 issue of the British journal,<br />\nNew Statesman and Nation. In \"Concentration Camps in<br />\nthe U.S.?\" Charles R. Allen, an American, told of his<br />\nvisit to the Allenwood (Pa.) Federal Prison, one of six<br />\n\"detention camps\" set aside under the Internal Security<br />\nAct of 1950. Then he interviewed Col. Guy C. Rexroad,<br />\nthe superintendent.<br />\nRexroad revealed that his camp was prepared to<br />\naccomodate some 4-7,000 \"detainees.\" Women and<br />\nchildren included? \"Yes, kids, too, maybe...But maybe<br />\nnobody will come here. God, I hope not. But what<br />\nshould we do in case of war? As I understand it, those<br />\npeople would overthrow the government by force and<br />\nviolence if we didn't put them away.\"<br />\nThe rumor is spreading again. For a year and a half<br />\nthe threat of concentration camps has constantly been<br />\nsounded by H. Rap Brown of the Student Non-Violent<br />\nCoordinating Committee. To the blacks, the new left,<br />\nthe hippies,it all once more seems real. They aren't the<br />\nonly ones.<br />\nIn 1968 such conservative metropolitan dailies as<br />\nthe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the Washington \u2022Evening<br />\nStar and the Milwaukee Journal took editorial notice of<br />\na proposal by the House Committee on Un-American<br />\nActivities to use the camps should the \"need\" arise. A<br />\nLook article reported that \"the basic bleak theme of<br />\nmass imprisonment is consistent\u2014and consistently<br />\nspreading\u2014coast to coast.\"<br />\nEmergency Detention Act<br />\nIs the rumor fOunded in the wish-fulfillment<br />\nfantasies of a masochistic left\u2014or is there substance to it?<br />\nThe law at issue is Title II of the Internal Security<br />\nAct. Commonly called \"the Emergency Detention Act,\"<br />\nTitle II gives the President of the United States power to<br />\nproclaim an internal security emergency in the event of<br />\n\"any one of the following: (I) invasion of the territory<br />\nof the United States or its possessions;(2) delcaration of<br />\nwar by Congress; or (3) insurrection within the United<br />\nStates in .d of a foreign enemy.\"<br />\nWhen this national emergency is declared, \"the<br />\nPresident, acting through the Attorney General, is<br />\nhereby authorized to apprehend and by order<br />\ndetain...each person as to whom there is reasonable<br />\nground to believe that such person probably will engage<br />\nin, or probably will conspire with others to engage in,<br />\nacts of espionage or of sabotage.\"<br />\nDetention is prescribed for anyone holding<br />\nmembership since January 1, 1949, in the Communist<br />\nParty, USA,or \"any other organization or political party<br />\nwhich seeks to overthrow or destroy by force and<br />\nviolence the Government of the United States or any of<br />\nits political subdivisions.\"<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nThe law provides that the detainee be given a<br />\nhearing, without right of bail, before a \"preliminary<br />\nhearing officer,\" whose decision can be appealed<br />\nthrough a \"Detention Review Board.\" Contrary to all<br />\nnorms ofjudicial procedure, at no stage in the case is the<br />\nAttorney General \"required to furnish information the<br />\nrevelation of which would disclose the identity or<br />\nevidence of government agents or officers which he<br />\nbelieves it would be dangerous to national safety and<br />\nsecurity to divulge.\" That is to say, concrete evidence<br />\nneed not be presented on the nebulous excuse of<br />\n\"national security\", whatever that might mean in the<br />\nminds of those who wish to make the case. The burden<br />\nof proof lies with the defence not the prosecution. The<br />\nroles remain reversed through all appellate stages.<br />\nSection 104 (c) of Title II provides that the<br />\ndetainee be \"confined in such places of detention as may<br />\nbe prescribed by the Attorney General.\" Accordingly,<br />\nsites for the \"detention- camp program\" were set aside<br />\nin 1952 on a \"standby basis.\" In addition to Allenwood,<br />\nthere were sites picked in Tule Lake, Calif.; Avon Park,<br />\nFla.; El Reno, Okla.; and Wickenberg and Florence, Ariz.<br />\nViolates Constitution<br />\nThe constitutionality of Title II is, to be<br />\ncharitable, highly questionable. Potentially, the act<br />\nviolates: (1)the First Amendment by being overly broad<br />\nand vague, thereby inhibiting the exercise of speech and<br />\nassembly rights; (2) the Fourth Amendment by<br />\nauthorizing deprivation of liberty upon suspicion rather<br />\nthan \"probable cause\" and by authorizing detention<br />\nwithout judicial safeguards;(3)the Fifth Amendment by<br />\nauthorizing incarceration solely because of membership<br />\nin a political party;(4)the Fifth and Sixth Amendments<br />\nby authorizing punishment without trial, by denying the<br />\ndetainee the right to confront his accusers and to<br />\ncross-examine the witnesses against him, and by too<br />\nseverly restricting the scope of judicial review; (5) the<br />\nEighth Amendment by imposing cruel and unusual<br />\npunishment where no crime has been committed and by<br />\nproviding for indefinite detention without the right to<br />\nbail.<br />\nIn an article appearing in the January, 1962,<br />\nMinority of One, ACLU Legal Director Melvin L. Wulf<br />\nquestioned the facade of procedural safeguards provided<br />\nby the law. He hazarded \"that it will be far easier to get<br />\ninto one of our detention camps than to get out.\"<br />\nDescribing the procedure of appeals as a \"Kafkaesque<br />\njourney,\" he found the anti-Communist provision<br />\nparticularly striking\u2014\"a provision of a simplicity defying<br />\nthe manifold efforts of lawyers, scholars and jurists over<br />\nseveral hundred years to distribute fairly between the<br />\naccused and society the benefits and burdens of a just<br />\nsystem of criminal law.\"<br />\nThought Control Business<br />\nPresident Harry S.Truman was less restrained. In<br />\nvetoing the act, Truman declared, \"It would put the<br />\nGovernment of the United States in the thought control<br />\nbusiness. ..No considerations of expediency can justify<br />\nthe enactment of such a bill as this, a bill which would<br />\nso greatly weaken our liberties and give aid and comfort<br />\nto those who would destroy us.\"<br />\n<br />\nMore critical still was North Dakota Senator<br />\nWilliam Langer, who observed,\"So it is now proposed to<br />\nhave concentration camps in America! We can be<br />\nabsolutely certain that the concentration camps are for<br />\nonly one purpose: namely, to put in them the kind of<br />\npeople those in authority do not like!\"<br />\nSenator Karl Mundt, hardly noted for his softness<br />\non Communism, pointed out that the Act provided for<br />\n\"concentration camps into which people might be put<br />\nwithout benefit of trial, but merely by an executive<br />\nfiat. ..simply by an assumption, mind you, that an<br />\nindividual might be thinking about engaging in espionage<br />\nor sabotage.\"<br />\nEven Senator Pat McCarren, author of the parent<br />\nbill, termed Title II \"a concentration camp measure,<br />\npure and simple.\"<br />\nAre we capable of using the Emeigency Detention<br />\nAct? While the horror of Nazi Germany still haunts our<br />\nmemory, we conveniently avoid thinking about the<br />\n\"relocation\" camps for Japanese-Americans during<br />\nWorld War II. The Federal government in 1942 arrested,<br />\nconfiscated the property of and granted no hearings to<br />\nor redress for some 119,000 Issei (Japanese-born<br />\nimmigrants) and Nisei (second generation<br />\nJapanese-Americans.) In the course of the war against<br />\nthe Axis powers, not one case of espionage or aid to the<br />\nenemy could be traced to a Japanese-American.<br />\nFour years after we rounded up our Japanese, we<br />\ndenounced the Nazi concentration camps. Four years<br />\nafter Nuremburg we passed the Emergency Detention<br />\nAct.<br />\nJ. Walter Yeagley, head of the Internal Security<br />\nDivision of the Justice Department during the Johnson<br />\nAdministration, became irritated with all the talk about<br />\nconcentration camps and determined to put a stop to it.<br />\nInquirers at Yeagley's office received a form letter<br />\ndenying the existence of any such camps on a ready-alert<br />\nfor prospective tenants.<br />\nShabby Shape<br />\nYeagley's form letter made much of the fact that<br />\nno funds have been allocated to maintain the camps<br />\nsince 1957 and, further, that the camps have been<br />\ndiscontinued as \"detention centers.\" Five of the six<br />\ncamps have been placed in the jurisdiction of the U.S.<br />\nBureau of Prisons and serve as minimum security<br />\nprisons. The sixth, at Tule Lake, has been subdivided<br />\namong local residents.<br />\nHowever, in each case the Federal government<br />\nretains the right to re-enter on 24 hours notice. It will<br />\ncontinue to hold this right as long as Title II is the law of<br />\nthe land. The question of allocation of separate funds to<br />\nmaintain the camps is irrelevant: They obviously are<br />\nbudgeted through the Bureau of Prisons. True, the<br />\ncamps are in shabby shape. But that Will not deter those<br />\nwho wish to use them.<br />\nInternal Insurrection<br />\nCharles Allen visited the six original sites two years<br />\nago.

Most striking is<br />\nBryan's endorsement of Constitutional<br />\nAmendments XVI-XIX.<br />\nHowever, there has been less<br />\nattention to Bryan's role in expanding<br />\nthe electoral base of the Democratic<br />\nparty. Specifically, Bryan's ability to<br />\nbreak resistance to the Democratic<br />\nparty in the Far West helped pave the<br />\nway for Woodrow Wilson's marginal<br />\nre-election in 1916.<br />\nPrior to Bryan's nomination in<br />\n1896, the Democratic party rarely<br />\ncarried a Far Western state in a<br />\nPresidential election. Grover Cleveland,<br />\nthe Democratic nominee in the three<br />\nelections preceding 1896, usually ran<br />\nwell behind in this region and had his<br />\nprincipal success in carrying California,<br />\nwhich he had lost twice, in 1892.<br />\nIndeed, in 1892 the Democrats yielded<br />\ntheir place on the ballot in Colorado,<br />\nIowa and Wyoming to Populist<br />\ncandidate General James Weaver.<br />\nNew York Nominees<br />\nThe Democrats had based their<br />\n<br />\nPresidential electoral hopes on a<br />\ncombination of the solid South and a<br />\nfew large states in the East and Midwest.<br />\nFrom 1868 to 1892, all but one of the<br />\nDemocratic nominees was from New<br />\nYork, seeking the biggest electoral prize<br />\nin the Union. The other candidate,<br />\nGeneral Winfield Scott Hancock in<br />\n1880, was a Pennsylvanian.<br />\nBryan in 1896 sought to win<br />\nthrough a different route: a solid<br />\nelectoral coalition of the still-solid<br />\nSouth, the Far West and the agricultural<br />\nand industrial Midwest while conceding<br />\nto the Republicans New England and<br />\nthe North Central states.<br />\nBryan came closest to success in<br />\n1896, when he was badly beaten in the<br />\nElectoral College, 271 to 176. Bryan's<br />\nvictory chances fell apart because he<br />\ncould not carry the large Midwestern<br />\nstates, and even lost a close race in<br />\nCalifornia. However, he carried most of<br />\nthe Rocky Mountain states, thus<br />\nbreaking those states' longstanding<br />\nresistance to Democratic Presidential<br />\nnominees.<br />\nWestern Hard Core<br />\nBryan's two subsequent<br />\ncampaigns, his Western strength<br />\n<br />\ngradually receded and the Solid South<br />\ncame to represent a greater portion of<br />\nhis total electoral vote. Nevertheless, he<br />\nmaintained a hard core of Western<br />\nsupport which would be of advantage to<br />\nlater Democratic candidates.<br />\nFor instance, in 1908 Bryan<br />\nreceived about 34% of the vote while<br />\nlosing Oregon to William Howard Taft.<br />\nIn 1912, due to the party split between<br />\nTaft and Theodore Roosevelt, Democrat<br />\nWoodrow Wilson carried Oregon. But<br />\nthe combined Republican strength<br />\nremained at its level of 1908, and<br />\nWilson actually received Bryan's share<br />\nof the vote, 34%.<br />\nIn 1912, the Republican split was<br />\nso profound that Wilson received 435<br />\nelectoral votes and carried every region<br />\nof the country. In 1916, however, the<br />\nRepublicans nominated a tough ticket.<br />\nCharles Evans Hughes, formerly<br />\nSupreme Court Associate Justice and<br />\nGovernor of New York, ran for<br />\nPresident and former Vice President<br />\nCharles Fairbanks of Indiana ran for<br />\nVice President.<br />\nWilson was behind in most of the<br />\nEast and industrial Midwest. To win,<br />\nWilson had to form an electoral<br />\ncoalition of the Solid South, the Far<br />\n<br />\nWest and some of the Middle West. In<br />\nother words, he had to execute<br />\nsuccessfully the strategy that had thrice<br />\nfailed Bryan.<br />\nBut Wilson was actually building<br />\non the pioneering work of Bryan. Had<br />\nWilson had to commence the job of<br />\nbreaking Far Western influence to<br />\nDemocratic candidates, it is doubtful<br />\nthat he could have finished the job in<br />\nthe short space of the campaign of<br />\n1916.<br />\n1916 proved that, under certain<br />\ncircumstances, Bryan's original electoral<br />\nstrategy could barely succeed. Hughes<br />\ncut a swath through the Eastern<br />\nseaboard and added the Midwestern<br />\nindustrial states, with the single major<br />\nexception of Ohio.<br />\nHowever, Wilson succeeded in the<br />\nmonotonously Solid South, and the<br />\nWestern states, save Oregon, voted<br />\nsolidly for him. California, which had<br />\nnever voted Democratic for President<br />\nsince 1892, was in doubt through<br />\nElection Night before swinging its<br />\nthirteen electoral votes to Wilson.<br />\nCalifornia made the difference in the<br />\nelection as the final Electoral College<br />\nvote was 277 for Wilson and 254 for<br />\nHughes.<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAR. 21, 1969<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHopkins,Goucher Film Festival Audiences Dead<br />\nBy ELLIOT KRIEGER<br />\nTake one, two, Maryland Film<br />\nFestival three...third film festival, at<br />\nthree schools, in three parts, and no<br />\none, no one could figure out the<br />\nschedules: Thursday night somewhere it<br />\nstarted and ended somewhere Sunday<br />\nbut not everywhere, with all shows at<br />\n8:30 (with some exceptions), plus<br />\nrumors that the shows at Hopkins were<br />\nfor free (unfounded) that the shows at<br />\nthe Institute were two crowded<br />\n(nothing is too crowded),) that the<br />\nShows at Goucher were empty (not full<br />\nanyway).<br />\nMost of the films were from New<br />\nYork, many from Maryland, the winner<br />\narid most of the best films were from<br />\nCalifornia, one from North Dakota,<br />\nundoubtedly the most obscure state in<br />\nthe union.

A large part of the audience was<br />\nthere only to see Canned Heat, and probably thought<br />\nthat B. B. King was the name of a groovy new<br />\npsychedelic band.<br />\nThe group that started off the show, King<br />\nSolomon's Minds, might have been a big hit at little<br />\nSheldon's Bar Mitzvah, but they didn't quite make it on<br />\nthe Civic Center stage. The lead singer, a seventeen year<br />\n<br />\nold narcissist from Pikesville, had all the trappings of<br />\ngreasy Baltimore cool, including the latest Sears and<br />\nRoebuck Mod a Go-Go fashions. They did shoddy<br />\nversions of a few old Top 40 hits, and then capped it off<br />\nwith, as they put it, \"Our own superfab arrangement of<br />\nthe Turtlesit ain't me Babe.\" After this demonstration<br />\nof musical ineptness, they fortunately cleared the stage<br />\nto make way for the man I came to see, Mr. B.

Big, old, and stocky,<br />\nwith years of cheap Southern jook joints, and grimy<br />\none-night stands behind him, he turned towards his<br />\nwhite audience, and sang,\"Everyday I have the blues....\"<br />\nFrom that moment, the audience was his. With a casual<br />\nflock of the knobs on his big guitar, he plucked the first<br />\nsweet, clear, and poignant note, bringing out a low sigh<br />\nfrom the audience.<br />\nAfter each line he sang, he played a few nimble<br />\nriffs, and when the time came for the guitar break, lie<br />\nshowed everyone why he is considered the best blues<br />\nguitarist in America. With blinding speed and agility, he<br />\nzipped up and down the neck of the guitar, confidently<br />\ngetting from it high-pitched wailings, or low, blucsy<br />\nmoans.<br />\nSuperb Musicmanship<br />\n<br />\nWhen he finished the first number, the audience<br />\nresponded with delighted howls of appreciation. With a<br />\nquick \"thank you\", he went-right into the next number,<br />\nan up-tempo shuffle blues. With good solid backing from<br />\nthe sax and trumpet, lie played a series of quick, jazzy<br />\nriffs. In the next few numbers he indulged in a little<br />\nold-fashioned showmanship, including playing the guitar<br />\nonly with the left hand, and holding out the guitar and<br />\nletting the note waver for twelve bars.<br />\nHis singing was in a slick Jimmy Rushing,<br />\nKansas-City blues style, rather than in a gravelly voiced<br />\nChicago blues mode. He used some old-time singing<br />\nhistrionics, like clenched hands and upraised arms,<br />\nreminiscent of early jazz singers. But B. B. King doesn't<br />\nhave to smash his guitar, set his hair on fire, or take off<br />\nhis pants to attract attention. His superb musicmanship<br />\ndoes it for him.

If approached in an<br />\nopen, experimental manner, really exciting<br />\nadditions may be made to the academic<br />\nexperience of both students and faculty.<br />\nUnfortunately, if the mood of Friday's meeting<br />\nis any indication, the faculty is not eager to<br />\nexplore these possibilities.<br />\nThis reluctance on the part of the faculty is<br />\nonly one example of the conservative and elitist<br />\nattitude that seemed widespread at Friday's<br />\nmeeting. Much recent writing on the crisis in<br />\nhigher education has emphasized that the<br />\ngreatest resistance to meaningful reform lies not<br />\nin a benighted administration, but in the vested<br />\ninterests of the faculty.<br />\nThe truth of this insight was never more<br />\nevident than last Friday. Discussion of even the<br />\nmost modest reforms never attempted to<br />\nchallenge the validity of established notions, but<br />\nrather centered around how these notions could<br />\nbest be applied to the proposed new situation.<br />\nBut more serious than this unwillingness to<br />\nconsider change was the emergence of an attitude<br />\ntoward the student body that at best was<br />\ndegradingly paternalistic, and at worst viciously<br />\ncontemptuous.<br />\nWhat kind of education can students<br />\nexpect from men who accuse them of being<br />\n\"high-handed\" in desiring closer personal contact<br />\nwith their instructors? Are students and faculty<br />\nreally strange bedfellows? Who, then, should,<br />\nmake academic decisions, if not those directly<br />\naffected by them?<br />\n<br />\nIndeed, the concept of academic freedom,<br />\nwhich was trotted out innumerable times at<br />\nFriday's meeting, seems to be defined by a<br />\nsignificant number of the Hopkins faculty as<br />\nfollows: professors are free to teach what they<br />\nwant, when they want, and how they want,<br />\nwithout regard for student opinion. Students are<br />\nfree only to take the professors' courses or not<br />\n(and even this momentary freedom is denied to<br />\nthem!), but once they step inside the classroom<br />\ndoor, they are free only to be obediant<br />\nschoolboys.<br />\nFor an instant on Friday, the students<br />\nappeared to shed their schoolboy roles, and the<br />\nfaculty's righteous indignation was an<br />\nappropriate response, it seems, given the realities<br />\nof the Hopkins educational atmosphere.<br />\nStudents, do you want to be schoolboys<br />\nfor the rest of your university life? Faculty, can<br />\nyou honestly teach in a coercive and intimidating<br />\nenvironment? Faculty and student, are you<br />\nsatisfied that true education is possible at<br />\nHopkins without radical change?<br />\nWe, graduate students and faculty of the<br />\nNew University Conference, answer these<br />\nquestions with a loud and clear \"No!\" We ask<br />\nyou to join us in the coming months in<br />\ndiscussion and exploration not only of the<br />\npossibilities of the January interim period, but of<br />\nthe decision-making process and educational<br />\nstructure of the University. No one - students,<br />\nfaculty, or administration - should be satisfied<br />\nwith the way calendar reform was presented and<br />\ndecided upon.

For the<br />\nfirst time, the Student Council, speaking for the<br />\nundergraduate student body, brought clearly into focus<br />\nsuite significant questions about the nature of Hopkins<br />\nas an educational institution. Furthermore, in this effort,<br />\nit elicited a positive response from the administration<br />\nand the faculty that signifies that, perhaps, Hopkins as<br />\nan institution is finally ready to begin fulfilling its<br />\nresponsibilities to undergraduate education at a level<br />\ncommensurate with that which it has towards graduate<br />\neducation and research.<br />\nIn more precise terms, the specific issue about<br />\nWhich I am talking is the new academic calendar. The<br />\nrecent events\u2014the initial letter to President Gordon, the<br />\nstrike threat, the follow up meetings with President<br />\nGordon and the members of the Academic Council, and,<br />\nfinally, the meeting of the General Assembly of the<br />\nFaculty\u2014that explain how this particular issue unfolded<br />\nare all well known.<br />\nHowever, I would suggest that there is a larger<br />\nlesson to be learned from these events and that this<br />\n<br />\nparticular issue is merely the specific at-hand issue that<br />\nsymbolizes a much larger one.<br />\nForceful Stand<br />\nThe larger lesson to which I refer centers on the<br />\nwhole notion of what a student-faculty confrontation is<br />\nand how it should be handled. To be direct, I think that<br />\nHopkins, its students, and its faculty should be proud<br />\nbecause they have demonstrated, in the most real sense<br />\nof the word, that a campus confrontation\u2014no matter<br />\nwho it is between\u2014need not resort to violence in order to<br />\nbe resolved, and it has done this at a time when violence<br />\nseems to be the popular order of the day.<br />\nThe students took a forceful stand that brought<br />\nrapid and dramatic attention to the issue. They then<br />\nproceeded to pursue the issue on its merits, to<br />\ndemonstrate responsibly the breadth of their support,<br />\nand to express their position cogently and firmly, at all<br />\ntimes appealing to the reason and rationality of those<br />\ninvolved. At no time did they allow their position to be<br />\nweakened with unnecessary and provocative threats, nor<br />\ndid they succumb to the simplistic temptation that<br />\nquick and easy victory would come through the use of<br />\nuncontrolled force.<br />\n<br />\nBy the same token, the administration and the<br />\nfaculty responded in a genuine manner. They<br />\ndemonstrated, at every step of the way, a measure of<br />\ngood will, showed an awareness of the legitimacy of the<br />\nstudent position, and reacted intelligently to the<br />\nresponsibility of the student conduct. The final result<br />\nwas a victory. For whom? I would say,\"For all,\"\u2014for all<br />\nbecause no one has lost, and all have gained a somewhat<br />\nlarger measure of confidence in the good faith and'<br />\nreasonableness of the others.<br />\nConcern is Present<br />\nThere is one other lesson that must be noted from<br />\nthis issue, and that lesson is what this issue really<br />\nsymbolizes in terms of undergraduates' thinking about<br />\ntheir position in this University. The underlying notion<br />\nof the student position throughout this debate was the<br />\nbelief that this was more than just simply a physical<br />\nreform of the calendar, that this was a partial<br />\neducational reform for the University, a first step that<br />\nshowed that the faculty and administration were truly<br />\nconcerned with upgrading the quality of education for<br />\nthe undergraduates to a level equal to the very high level<br />\nof graduate study and research.

The usual objection to press<br />\ncoverage is that \"the damn fools can't get anything<br />\nstraight.\" Perhaps in this instance, those objecting to<br />\nthe presence of the University press were concerned<br />\nthat the N-L would get things too straight.<br />\nWhatever their motivation these professors, it<br />\nseems to me, reject the idea of an academic<br />\n\"community\" that extends beyond the faculty ranks.<br />\nThey are apparently convinced that only they<br />\nunderstand those things that matter, and they lack<br />\nconfidence in the ability of anyone else to<br />\nunderstand. They are elitists, pure and simple, and<br />\nelitists contribute little to any sense of \"community.\"<br />\nI confess that I didn't attend last Friday's<br />\nmeeting, but the reports I've heard\u2014of demands that<br />\nthe N-I, tape be erased, and of threats to a N-L<br />\nphotographer (\"Do you want to get that camera<br />\nbroken'?\")\u2014are not reasurring. That is, unless one<br />\ncontrasts the scene with one from last fall's<br />\ncampaign, when sonic of George Wallace's strong-arm<br />\nmen confiscated television news film which they felt<br />\nthe people \"wouldn't understand.\" Even in relief it's'<br />\nnot a very pleasant scene.<br />\nRobert J.

In a situation<br />\nsuch as this, how one conducts himself in pursuing his<br />\ngoal may well be equally important to his goal, if one<br />\nreally wants to achieve it.<br />\nIn this past case, it is beyond doubt in my mind<br />\nthat, in the final analysis, the strongest argument the<br />\nstudents had on their side was the responsibility of their<br />\nconduct, which made a sham of every effort to pass off<br />\nthis issue as a power confrontation for power's sake.<br />\nI would caution the administration to note well<br />\nthe benefits to be gained by approacling an issue solely<br />\non its merits immediately as it is presented and by acting<br />\nextent<br />\nas rapidly and as publicly as possible, even to the<br />\nof making symbolic gestures, perhaps of minor<br />\ninconvenience and only minor importance to them, that<br />\nwill clearly show the students the depth of their<br />\n<br />\nconcern.<br />\nthe<br />\nI would caution the faculty not to consider<br />\nthe<br />\nplacate<br />\nwill<br />\nthat<br />\ngesture<br />\nnew calendar as a token<br />\nstudents for the next several years, but to realize that<br />\nthis is only a first step toward making the quality of<br />\nundergraduate education here what it ought to be at an<br />\ninstitution of the quality of Hopkins.<br />\nthink<br />\nI would futher caution the faculty to this<br />\nof<br />\nons<br />\nimplicati<br />\npossible<br />\nthe<br />\nearnestly about what<br />\nif the<br />\nissue and future issues might be for the campus,<br />\nbut<br />\ntime,<br />\nthis<br />\ndid<br />\nit<br />\nas<br />\nmaturely<br />\nfaculty does not react as<br />\nalways<br />\nbut<br />\nrather foolishly turns to the tempting<br />\n\"ar.gued<br />\ndisastrous role of paternalism and discussion merits<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nto<br />\nagainst the students\" and not relevant<br />\nthe issue.<br />\nFinally, I would commend everyone<br />\ninvolved\u2014students, faculty, and administration\u2014because I<br />\nthink that together they have shown that wisdom,<br />\ndiscretion, and maturity are attributes that can give<br />\nsuccess, and success without violence.<br />\nI have written this article expressing my personal<br />\nreactions to the proceedings of the past few weeks.<br />\nHaving been intimately involved in this issue in its<br />\nentirety and many times having been pressed on both<br />\nsides for stronger or weaker action, I think that the<br />\nreflections are valid and should be, at the least, carefully<br />\nconsidered, and at the best, not forgotten.<br />\n<br />\nPROGRAMS IN LEVERING HALL<br />\n<br />\nBETA<br />\nTHETA PI<br />\n<br />\nSaturday, March 22, 7:30 P.M.<br />\n<br />\n3906 Canterbury Rd<br />\n<br />\nBlack Arts Night<br />\nSunday, March 23<br />\n11 A.M.

As a result, no one<br />\nhas really known what has been going on and the Board<br />\nof Managers attempts to get everyone together for a<br />\nmeeting have all failed despite the help of Dr. Bevan. He<br />\nsaid that neither the University nor the YMCA had<br />\nconsidered the programs that were involved in the<br />\nLevering controversy but had treated the whole affair<br />\nonly as a financial question. He said that he had to<br />\nconclude that the University's chain of command did<br />\nnot work effectively and that the University had failed<br />\nto appreciate the value of the tutoring programs and<br />\nOther Levering projects. This showed that the University<br />\nPut considerations of a purely budgetary nature before<br />\nconsiderations of student needs.<br />\nThe University's lack of interest in the whole<br />\nProblem of Levering Hall and its programs was also<br />\nemphasized by Dr. Wickwire. He said that his attempts<br />\nto setup meetings with various administrators on the<br />\nLevering Hall issue had met with continual disinterest.<br />\nHe also felt that a Chaplain cannot be effective if he has<br />\nto receive permission from three or four levels of<br />\nCommand before he can act on any problem.<br />\nChaplain Responsible<br />\nand Dr. Wickwire pointed out<br />\nGryder<br />\nBoth Dr.<br />\nthat the University Chaplain was responsible to the<br />\nWhole university and was not just a service provided for<br />\nthe students. The Chaplain's conserns should range<br />\nacross the entire spectrum of university activities and so<br />\nhe should have a great deal of flexibility to respond and<br />\nto serve. In the view of both men, the proposal to put<br />\nthe Chaplain and his budget under the control of the<br />\nOffice of Student Affairs would not provide the<br />\nnecessary flexibility.<br />\nThree students who have been involved in the<br />\nLevering Hall controversy, Jim Archibald, SA president,<br />\nJoe Weinberg, former SA president, and Jim Cleary,<br />\n<br />\nMR. ROBERT BILGRAVE, DIRECTOR OF STUDENT<br />\nAffairs felt that once the funds for a transitionary period<br />\nwere found, all difficulties with Levering Flail would be<br />\nsolved.<br />\n<br />\nstudent director of the SA tutoring program, all agreed<br />\nthat the problems of status and budget were crucial and<br />\nthey agreed that the University's proposal to put<br />\nLevering under the control of Student Affairs would<br />\nseverely limit the present programs and would be a real<br />\ndetriment to the development of any new programs.<br />\nArchibald argued that the University has always<br />\nrefused to cooperate in any whole-hearted manner with<br />\nLevering. He said that the Office of Student Affairs<br />\nwould suppress new programs of any real substance and<br />\nthat the Chaplain's Office had to have its own budget if<br />\nit was going to get anything done.<br />\n<br />\nDR. ALLYN KIMBALL, DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF<br />\nARTS AND SCIENCE, indicated that he was unaware of<br />\nattempts by Dr. Wickwire to establish contacts with the<br />\nAdministration.<br />\n<br />\nJoe Weinberg also stressed that the Chaplain's<br />\noffice has to be free of all unnecessary administrative<br />\ncontrols. Both he and Archibald pointed out that many<br />\nother leading universities put their chaplains' offices<br />\nunder the president and give them substantial autonomy.<br />\nWeinberg further stated that the Administrations has<br />\nlittle idea of how the Levering I hill programs are run.<br />\n\"In addition, the Administration has consistantly<br />\nrefused to make any attempt to seriously analyze the<br />\nneeds and impact of the programs, and they seem to he<br />\nmore inclined to issue dicta without facts.\"<br />\n<br />\nNew Minority Enterprise Office Raises Booker T. Spectre<br />\nBy DAVID MELAMED<br />\nThe Nixon administration created government<br />\nmachinery last week to foster a program of \"minority<br />\nenterprise\" previously known as \"black capitalism\".<br />\n\"To foster the economic status and pride of<br />\nmembers of our minority groups,\" stated the President,<br />\nwe must seek to involve them more fully in our private<br />\nenterprise system.\" However, the chances of success for<br />\nthis program were judged as \"almost nil\" by Dr. David<br />\nDonald, a noted expert in the field of Southern History.<br />\nNo Real Change<br />\nDr. Lou Stettler, who along with Professors<br />\nSparrow and Oakland studied the economics of black<br />\nCapitalism, felt that Nixon's program will raise the<br />\nincomes of some black people and the opportunities of<br />\nMany others, but will not substantially alter the<br />\neconomic status of the black community.<br />\nThe new program involves the creation of an<br />\nOffice of Minority Business Enterprise to be staffed by<br />\nexperts in banking, business, and foundation work, along<br />\nWith \"a black man and a Mexican-American to deal with<br />\nthe minority communities.\" Nixon's statement described<br />\nthis office as \"the focal point of the administration's<br />\nefforts to assist the establishment of new minority<br />\nenterprises and expansion of existing ones.\"<br />\nUnder the direction of the Secretary of<br />\nCommerce, Maurice Stans, the new office will<br />\ncoordinate the 116 existing programs scattered through<br />\n21 federal departments and agencies which are or could<br />\n<br />\nbe used to help minority-group business. The office will<br />\n\"seek to concentrate government resources, and also to<br />\ninvolve the business community and others in order to<br />\nenlist the full range of the nation's resources.\"<br />\nThe program Nixon is creating, according to<br />\nProfessor Donald, \"is exactly what Booker T.<br />\nWashington wanted back in the 1880's.\" This too, was a<br />\ntime of \"heightened racial tensions\" \u2014 any opportunities<br />\nwhich Reconstruction had opened up for the black man<br />\nwere now closed. Washington felt that the Negro's \"only<br />\nsalvation was a kind of withdrawal \u2014 to build a parallel<br />\nsociety; the most valuable thing was to have a skill or to<br />\nopen one's own enterprise.\"<br />\nThe idea, explained Dr. Donald,\"didn't work then<br />\nand has even less chance of working today.\" The plans<br />\nof both President Nixon and Booker T. Washington<br />\ninvolve the creation of small enterprises such as the<br />\ncorner grocery store. \"In our society these are dying<br />\ninstitutions. Their chances of being successfully<br />\nestablished are slim \u2014 they cannot compete with national<br />\nfirms.\"<br />\n\"It is a hopelessly formidable kind of<br />\nundertaking,\" concluded Dr. Donald, \"because for a<br />\nblack man with little management experience opening a<br />\nbusiness in a crime infested area, credit is so difficult to<br />\nget. It is an unimaginative, cheap program which requires<br />\nlittle investment of time or money.

It is often argued that the cause<br />\nis the lack of skill of minority group members. The<br />\nprogram is setting up training sessions in an effort to<br />\nreduce the learning costs.<br />\nIt is also argued that the problem has been the<br />\nhigh cost of credit for black entrepreneurs due to the<br />\nit<br />\nsituation and actual discrimination. The<br />\nprogram will attempt to remedy discrimination by<br />\ndiscriminating in favor of black people. Government<br />\nloans at below-market rates will be utilized to offset the<br />\nhigh-risk situation.<br />\nThe economics of the black ghetto are similar to<br />\nthe economics of underdeveloped nations, stated Dr.<br />\nStealer.

There is just not enough money to go around. It<br />\nis not my intention to emphasize the sensational aspects of<br />\nthe problem involved in raising money for post-season<br />\nplay, but rather to report the existance .of this deplorable<br />\nsituation and offer constructive criticism where possible.<br />\nThis subject has been brought to my attention by the attempts<br />\nof Charlie Goddell of the Booster Club and other interested students<br />\nto raise noney to send seven of the varsity swimmers to the NCAA<br />\nCollege Division Swimming Championships (March 20-22) at<br />\nSpringfield, Mass. The Booster Club, which has raised money on<br />\nseveral occasions in the past, has been trying to scrape up the<br />\nnecessary $600 to send our tankmen to the nationals.<br />\nAccompanying the swimmers are Coach Comfort and manager Josh<br />\nTreem (who has, by the way, offered to pay his own way).<br />\nComfort Estimates<br />\nCoach Comfort conservatively estimates that it will cost $75<br />\nper person accounting for the $600 total. This per capita breaks<br />\ndown as follows; $20 for transportation, $21 for motel (one of the<br />\nleast expensive available), $24 total for food, and $10 for general<br />\nexpenses.<br />\nAs of presstime, $536.35 has been raised. Of this, $200 comes<br />\nfrom Mr. Bilgrave's contingency fund, $191.35 comes from<br />\nlifeguarding that the swimmers have done themselves, $75 from the<br />\nH-Club, Beta and Phi Gam each donated $25. Ten dollars came from<br />\nalumni, and Col. Serena said that he would kick in ten dollars.<br />\nChange in Philosophy Needed<br />\nThe philosophy of the University since the days of Dean<br />\nShaffer has been that the Hop will not finance post-season<br />\ncompetitions; however, recent recommendations of the Athletic<br />\nCommittee have urged that this policy be changed. This is a step in<br />\nthe right direction, yet the suggestion did not solve the problem<br />\nfaced by this year's crop of nationally qualified swimmers.<br />\nIt seems a shame that these swimmers work and toil all season,<br />\nor, as in the case of Howie Chernick for three years and then are<br />\ndeserted by the Administration at the conclusion of the regular<br />\nseason. These swimmers have excelled to the point of qualifying for<br />\nnational competition and such outstanding achievement should be<br />\nencouraged. Whether the University wants to admit it or not, half<br />\nthe swimming team has qualified for the nationals and this is truly<br />\nrepresentative of Johns Hopkins. To quote Coach Comfort, \"The<br />\nNationals are a part of swimming\" and \"Not to beg, it sure would be<br />\nnice if the University would give us a hand\". Mr. Bilgrave's quick<br />\nresponse (to the tune of two hundred dollars) is commendable.<br />\nThe swimming team had an excellent season this year and,<br />\nwith Coach Comfort, in the next few years will be within the top ten<br />\nCollege Division teams. In the one year under his tutelage, the team<br />\nhas made tremendous strides and, in future seasons, our<br />\nparticipation in the Nationals will become the rule rather than the<br />\nexception. It would be a shame if this archaic practice of not<br />\nsupporting post-season competition is allowed to continue. The<br />\nUniversity claims it gives a damn about the student. Well, here is one<br />\narea where it is letting us down. It's about time for a change!<br />\nWe wish good luck to the swimmers and hope that this<br />\nproblem can be avoided in future seasons and in other sports.<br />\nHowever, we would like to take space to publicly thank Mr. Bilgrave<br />\nand all others who've made the trip to Springfield possible.<br />\n<br />\nFoes Could Provide Strenuous<br />\nOpposition for Blue Jay Ten<br />\nRutgers, with the loss of their outstanding<br />\ngoalie, figures to be a little weaker than last year;<br />\nbut always boasts a large corps of Long Isla\"<br />\nrecruits.<br />\nNavy, at first glance, is also a bit weaker<br />\nthan last year having graduated All-American<br />\nMac Ogilvie in the goal and All-American Cad,<br />\nTamulevitch on defense. However, scouting<br />\nreports indicate that Ogilvie's replacement;<br />\nSupko, will do more than an adequate job, ana<br />\nthat Coach Bilderback has come up with a new<br />\nsuper-stud who did not play last season to make<br />\neveryone forget Tamulevitch. Of course, Nag<br />\nalways has a hoarde of strong midfielders.<br />\nPerhaps they are a bit weaker, but they will be<br />\nno push-overs.<br />\nNemesis.:<br />\nFinally, there is the old Hopkins<br />\nof th.elt<br />\nfour<br />\nMaryland. With the graduation of<br />\nfirst six middies and Steve Lavaut, coupled with<br />\n<br />\nBy JASON KRAVITT<br />\n<br />\nAt first glance, the Varsity Lacrosse<br />\nschedule appears extremely favorable to<br />\nthe Blue Jays. The previous 11 game<br />\nschedule has been cut to 10 with 7 games<br />\nat home. A closer examination, though,<br />\nreveals quite a different story. To begin<br />\nwith, 3 out of the last 5 games are away<br />\nincluding the two most difficult: Army<br />\nand Maryland.<br />\nIn addition, Hopkins' opponents are<br />\ngreatly improved over former years. Yale, after a<br />\npoor start which included a 20-1 rout at the<br />\nhands of the Blue Jays, finished fast amassing a<br />\n7-4-1 record and winning 5 and tying one of their<br />\nlast 6 games. In addition, this year's squad<br />\nfeatures soph goalie Mike Stanton who will be<br />\nquite a change from last year's net-minder.<br />\nMt. Washington, has lost some strength on<br />\nattack and defense which will feature Rob<br />\nMcCool, Steve Levy and Ed Shaivist. However, as<br />\nusual, the Mounts will feature tremendous<br />\nstrength and depth at midfield and in the goal.<br />\nAs always, this game will depend on the mental<br />\nattitude of both teams.<br />\nRegan Returns for Washington<br />\nWashington College again features<br />\nall-American Phil Regan on attack and will be<br />\nseeking to duplicate last year's feat as Small<br />\nCollege National Champion.<br />\nIn an informal Coaches Poll, many picked<br />\nan improved Princeton team as No. 3 in the<br />\nnation. The Tigers will boast much heralded<br />\nsophomore Pete Johnson at attack, of Garden<br />\ncity fame, and most of the defense which held<br />\nMaryland to a 6-6 tie in double over-time last<br />\nyear.<br />\nVirginia will perhaps be the most improved<br />\nof all because of the fact that they will be<br />\nplaying their freshmen \u2014 four of whom Coach<br />\nScott feels will start. Their defense, featuring<br />\nall-American Pete Coy, will return intact and<br />\nwith a revamped attack, the Cavaliers should give<br />\nthe Blue Jays quite a tense battle.<br />\nMysterious Loyola<br />\nNot too much is known about Loyola, but<br />\nthe Charles Street Massacre should continue to<br />\nbe as bloody as in recent years.<br />\nBeginning the killer stretch of the season, is<br />\nthe Army game. Coach Bud Adams has put<br />\ntogether one of the potentially most potent<br />\nattacks of the country with All-American Peter<br />\nCramblitt and a new Soph sensation, Cafero, out<br />\nof Long Island, who set all sorts of scoring<br />\nrecords for the Plebes last year. Their midfields,<br />\nwhich last year were rather young, return almost<br />\nintact and bolstered by one of the best<br />\nsophomore crew in years. Army's only losses<br />\nwere a few defensemen which a service Academy<br />\ncan always replace. To predict the outcome of<br />\nthis game, one must remember that it is being<br />\nplayed at West Point.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on Page 15)<br />\n<br />\n\u2018ti<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE Scrimmages Prepare Jay Stickers<br />\ntomorrow's home opener against Yale.<br />\n<br />\nfor<br />\n<br />\n1'1).<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n....<br />\n<br />\n1,<br />\n<br />\n1,\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n.1<br />\n,<br />\n11 - 11 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022,..-a<br />\n.....<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAR. 21, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nB.I.A.

Bart Effinger, and<br />\nlast year's starter, Graham, will team up<br />\nWith converted All-American<br />\ndefenseman, Hugh Mallon in this<br />\ndepartment. But in Coach Howard's<br />\nfavor is the nation's best goalie Norm<br />\nVanDershuyt, and a vicious defense that<br />\nallowed Mt. Washington only four goals<br />\nin a recent scrimmage. Of course,<br />\n<br />\nMaryland will have plenty of midfield<br />\ndepth.<br />\nThis year, then, there will be a lot<br />\nmore close games and a general<br />\nequalization of talent with the<br />\ntraditional powers playing much closer<br />\nto their opposition. It will be quite a feat<br />\nfor the Blue Jays to duplicate last year's<br />\nNational title. But then, they have done<br />\nit before and who is to say that they<br />\ncannot do it again?<br />\n<br />\nPitching Strong<br />\nThe strongest part of the squad is<br />\nits pitching, with four proven reliable<br />\nperformers. Senior Hal Thorne, and<br />\njunior Rich Thielke, both right-handers<br />\nare both returning lettermen and are<br />\ncapable of consistently getting the job<br />\ndone. Nelson Cover, a junior who had to<br />\nsit out last season because of his transfer<br />\nstudent status, and Glen Deuchler, a left<br />\nhanded sophomore add depth.<br />\nBacking these four up will be<br />\nDave Reeves, and George Inana, right<br />\nhanders, and southpaw Stan Liebowitz.<br />\nAll of these men are inexperienced and<br />\nmust be tested before they can be relied<br />\nupon.<br />\nThe most doubtful position on<br />\nthe team is catcher. Barrette is currently<br />\ncounting on Co-captain Chip Breschkin<br />\n<br />\nto do the job. Last year Breschkin was<br />\nan all-Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\noutfielder. He was, however, a catcher<br />\nin his freshman year.<br />\nAnother outfielder, Bob Slacum,<br />\nwill be used as a backup man for<br />\nBreschkin. Slacum was also all-M.A.C.<br />\nlast year, and batted .471 in league<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nThe first base position is also<br />\ndoubtful. It will be filled by senior Mike<br />\nAvery, who was out all of last season<br />\nwith a broken ankle. He had an<br />\noperation earlier in the year and<br />\nprobably won't be at full speed for at<br />\nleast a while.<br />\nThe second base and shortstop<br />\npositions are pretty well set. Bruce<br />\nBouchard, a sophomore described as<br />\nexcellent by the coach,and who batted<br />\n.300 for the frosh last year, will be at<br />\nsecond. Co-captain, Jim Zuger, a<br />\nreturning letterman who batted .286<br />\nlast year,will play shortstop.<br />\nAt third base Dennis O'Neill and<br />\nTed Drake, both juniors will be<br />\ncompeting for the starting slot.

One government<br />\nofficial said that federal money is given directly to the<br />\ncolleges, which in turn decide how to apportion it<br />\namong the students and when to withdraw it.<br />\nUnder two recent laws, the colleges must cut off<br />\naid to students convicted of disorders. They would be<br />\nbanned from receiving aid for two years, even if they<br />\nwere transferred to another college.<br />\nAn amendment to the Higher Education Act of<br />\n1968 requires that money be cut off if a college, after a<br />\nhearing, finds that the student was convicted on<br />\ndisorderly conduct.

It is the primary problem of<br />\ncreating this confrontation, Mr. Taylor indicated,<br />\nwhich black students' programs are meant to cope<br />\nwith.<br />\nModel Criteria<br /><br />\nMr. Taylor's model \"Black Studies\" program is<br />\none which satisfies the following criteria:<br />\n\u2014vertical and horizontal control exclusively in\u2022<br />\nthe hands of members of the department; the<br />\ndetermination of the value or lack of value of a<br />\nparticular course to be taught by members of the<br />\nBlack Studies department, of the final judgement on<br />\nthe quality of another course, german to the<br />\neducation of black students, yet without the<br />\ndepartment, rests with members of the Black Studies<br />\ndepartment. This sovereignty extends to the removal<br />\nof \"bad\" courses from and appending of good<br />\ncourses to the curriculum.<br />\n\u2014selection of faculty\u2014The power to employ and<br />\ndismiss faculty within the Black Studies department<br />\nis supreme and rests, again, exclusively within the<br />\ndepartment.<br /><br />\nIt is Taylor's thesis that black students cannot<br />\nmake this confrontation within a \"white institution\"<br />\nwhich takes no cognizance of the differing educational<br />\nobjectives of blacks and whites. Only by the<br />\nintroduction of a program of black studies having<br />\nradically different educational objectives from the<br />\n\"white institution\" can black students there in strive<br />\nto attain their black goals.<br /><br />\nAutonomy<br />\nThe obvious corollary to these necessary<br />\nqualities of the Black Studies program is that those<br />\nwho are under its aegis are at once free from the<br />\ntraditional powers of both administration and faculty,<br />\nand controlled in the content of their instruction not<br />\nby the standards of methodology, but by the totalist<br />\ndictates of the department.<br /><br />\nAs a part of the Student Association's<br />\nBlack March program, Mr. Andress Taylor, a<br />\nmember of the faculty of Federal City<br />\nCollege, addressed a gathering of members of<br />\nthe Hopkins community on the nature of the<br />\n\"Black Studies Program.\"<br /><br />\nMR.

During a series of Senate Committee<br />\nhearings, a stream of scientists testified that the worth of<br />\nthe system sould not be determined due to the ban on<br />\nnuclear testing in the atmosphere. Thus, the Nixon<br />\nadministration has proposed a missile system about<br />\nWhich nothing is known, except what it is supposed to<br />\ndo.<br />\nDr. Stephen Ambrose, Hopkins military historian,<br />\nquestions whether the system is necessary since the<br />\nUnited States has the ability to destroy the Soviet Union<br />\n(or China)several times over from various vantage points<br />\nthroughout the world. With approximately one thousand<br />\ni ntercontinental ballistic missiles, countless B-52<br />\nbombers, and about 40 polaris submarines (each carrying<br />\nsixteen missiles) constantly prepared to attack the<br />\ncommunists, Dr. Ambrose thinks that \"our ability, to<br />\nretaliate is not in jeopardy.\"<br />\nThe question of the use of the Sentinel system as a<br />\ndeterrent to nuclear war has been brought forth both in<br />\nthe Congress and by faculty members. Senator John<br />\nSherman Cooper, (R-Ky.), lamented after the decision,<br />\nthat the President had \"an opportunity that perhaps no<br />\nOther President had before him.. .the chance to halt the<br />\nnuclear arms race.\"<br />\nLess Provocative<br />\nThere is doubt that the Russians will respond in a<br />\nstrong manner. Dr. Robert Slusser, professor of Russian<br />\nhistory, feels that Mr. Nixon proposed a system that is<br />\nless provocative than any other form of the ABM. He<br />\nwent on to say that the Soviet Union would not alter its<br />\nTeed of arms build up as a result of the establishment of<br />\nthe ABM.<br />\nSenator Phillip Hart, Michigan Democrat, claimed<br />\nthat the \"two systems (Sentinel and the Maginot Line)<br />\nWill prove about equally effective in guaranteeing<br />\nPeace,\" in response to claims that the ABM would<br />\nprevent nuclear war.<br />\nIn presenting the limited system, Mr. Nixon said<br />\nthat, \"The U.S. must take steps now to insure that our<br />\nstrategic retaliatory forces will not become vulnerable.\"<br />\nContrary to this point of view, Dr. Robert Rothstein,<br />\nHoykins political scientist, feels that \"the argument that<br />\ntiUS (the ABM) protects us against a Soviet attack is<br />\nfatuous.\"<br />\nDr. Rothstein goes on to critisize the ABM in<br />\nsaYlng that \"the ABM might not alter the strategic<br />\nbalance, but rather raise the level of force within it.\" He<br /><br />\ncontinued, \"there is no reason to believe that some form<br />\nof ABM might,in the future, make some sense.\"<br />\nMetropolitan Montana<br />\nHe felt that the system was reasonable only if an<br />\nagreement with the Soviet Union to halt the build up of<br />\narms could be reached while the ABM is being<br />\nconstructed.<br />\n\"If an accident did occur,\" Dr. Rothstein said, \"it<br />\n(the ABM) might be able to prevent disaster.\" This<br />\nwould be possible only if the system covered the entire<br />\ncountry. With the limited system proposed by Nixon the<br />\n\"metropolitan areas of North Dakota and Montana\" will<br />\nbe protected.<br />\nThe question of why Mr. Nixon asked Congress for<br />\nof missile bases rather than major cities is<br />\nprotection<br />\nthe<br />\nopen to debate. The consensus of opinion is that a<br />\nlimited _system of the type Nixon put forth has the best<br />\nchance of getting through Congress.<br />\nThe President was pressured by the Pentagon to<br />\nsupport the system and by senate liberals to dispose of<br />\nthe plan. He compromised and appeased both parties.<br />\nDr. Slusser claimed that \"The new administration is<br />\nbehaving in a fairly shrewd manner.\"<br />\nPolitical Decision<br />\nDr. Rothstein said that, \"Everybody in<br />\nWashington thinks that this is a political decision, and<br />\nhas no strategic base.\" Dr. Robert L. Peabody, Hopkins<br />\nprofessor of political science, felt that the protection of<br />\nthe cities was eliminated because opposition to the<br />\nprogram revolved around this factor.<br />\nThe pentagon is especially pleased with the<br />\ndecision to protect its military bases. Members of the<br />\nJoint Chiefs of Staff recently reduced their request for a<br />\nhard ABM and what they got from the President falls<br />\ninto their plans well.<br />\nDr. Peabody, an authority on legislative processes<br />\nsaid that the limited system will stand a good chance of<br />\ngaining full support, with no reductions in<br />\nappropriations, because it will be presented in small<br />\nportions over the course of several years.<br />\nHe said that the projected total cost of six to eight<br />\nbillion dollars will probably fall short of the final cost,<br />\nand thus cause some scrutinization of the entire<br />\nDepartment of Defense budget. However, Dr. Peabody<br />\ndid not think that the increased study would cause more<br />\nthan minor reductions in the departments<br />\nappropriations.<br />\nDr. Peabody indicated that the added cost of the<br />\nSentinel system might cause reduction in money<br />\napportioned to domestic programs. This would create a<br />\ngreater cut in these programs than already has been<br />\nproposed by the efficiency-oriented Nixon<br />\nadministration.<br /><br />\nDR.

Mills, the vice-chairman of the<br />\nGeneral Assembly, said after the meeting,\"I predict that<br />\nPlan C will be approved.\" This seemed to be the general<br />\nconsensus of faculty and administration members due to<br />\ntwo strong objections to the first two proposals.<br />\nMany professors objected to the elimination of a<br />\nformal exam period. \"Somebody is out for a rude<br />\nawakening,\" exclaimed one professor to SC President<br />\nRuss Passarella. \"You're going to find two or three hours<br />\nof exams in different subjects that last week.\"<br />\nIt was the \"mini-semester\" concept, though, that<br />\ncaused the most controversy. Dr. William Bevan, Vice<br />\nPresident and chairman of the ad hoc Committee,<br />\nexplained that the \"mini-semester\" would be for<br />\nindependent study, study abroad, work experience and<br />\ngeneral \"educational innovation.\" Many professors said a<br />\nfour-week program was not suitable to the framework of<br />\ntheir departments, especially in the sciences. Dean Carl<br />\nSwanson said in reply to a question, \"In the biology<br />\ndepartment, at least, it will be hard to figure out a<br />\n\"mini-semester\" program.\" Some faculty members<br />\nthought the plan was completely unrealistic for large<br />\nlecture classes, while others wanted to know if the<br />\nincreased work during this four-week period would<br />\naugment their salary.<br />\nThe tone of the Assembly was quickly established<br />\nby the first motion of the meeting\u2014it asked that all<br />\npersons present who are not faculty members be asked<br />\nto leave. The author of the motion, Dr. Martin Larrabee<br />\nof the Biophysics Department, was quickly challenged<br />\nby Chairman Lincoln Gordon. \"There are no rules that<br />\nforbid spectators in the galleries,\" the President<br />\nexplained. \"And I don't see anything about the nature<br />\nof these issues that demands secrecy.\" Larrabee's<br />\nmotion, after further discussion, was defeated.<br />\nIn another attempted revolt from the proceedings,<br /><br />\nl'<br />\n, &lt;1<br /><br />\n4t<br /><br />\nDr. George Owen, chairman of physics, stated, \"I insist<br />\nthat the faculty really should run itself. I make the<br />\nmotion that the faculty take over the discussion.\" An<br />\nargument by several professors followed this motion.<br />\nOne called the Owen proposal another \"delaying tactic,\"<br />\nand said the opponents of calendar reform wanted to<br />\nmake this a \"rump meeting.\" The motion was soon<br />\nrejected.<br />\nMidway through the proceedings, Russ Passarella<br />\nspoke to the faculty. He said that the main studeht<br />\nobjections to the present system were that school begins<br />\ntoo late in the fall, Christmas is not a \"real\" vacation,<br />\nJanuary is a \"dead month,\" the second semester ends<br />\ntoo late, and that there is no opportunity to concentrate<br />\nin one subject area.<br />\nHe noted that of the 52% who voted in the<br />\nStudent Council's calendar referendum, 95% of the<br />\nstudents supported 4-1-4. \"It would be greatly<br />\nfrustrating to see this issue bogged down,\" Passarella<br />\nstated. \"4-1-4 embodies all the old complaints and<br />\nanswers our educational desires.\" John Ferchak,<br />\nspeaking for the graduates, said that the graduate<br />\ndelegates, representing 16 of the 23 departments at<br />\nHomewood, voted 15-1 for calendar reform . in an<br />\ninformal poll.<br />\nIn the question period after Passarella's speech, Dr.<br />\nRobert W.

It is<br />\neducational reform....The `mini-semester' is very vague,<br />\nand, if worked out, would be a major change.\" Later,<br />\nDr. Carl Christ, professor of economics, suggested an<br />\nadditional calendar plan, a 11-11-11 trimester system.,<br />\nThis was quickly rejected as too major a change.<br />\nThrough the separate proposals of Dr. Ferdinand<br />\nHamburger, chairman of the electrial engineering<br />\ndepartment, and Dr. William McElroy of biology,<br />\nanother proposal was devised into Plan C.

Due to the distinct possibility of<br />\ncut back in available funding from the<br />\nUniversity, Jim Cleary, head of the<br />\ntutorial project, stated that the grant was<br />\nextremely important.<br />\nThe tutorial program presently includes<br />\nabout:130 Hopkins students and 175 high school<br />\nstudents. Each has been assigned a tutee, bringing<br />\nthe total number of people involved in the actual<br />\nprogram to over 600 individuals. Mrs. Lynn<br />\nKagan, director of the program, stated that the<br />\nprogram \"needs better materials and more<br />\nspecifically trained help. We desperately need<br />\nsomeone to coordinate activities.\"<br />\nAlthough the City Council's role in matters<br />\ndealing with procurement of \"outside<br />\nfunds\"--the 0E0 grant is solely federal<br />\nfunding\u2014is purely advisory, the decision is<br />\nexpected to have significant impact in<br />\nWashington. The general chances for the<br />\nrequest's success are slim, according to Mrs.<br />\nKagen.<br />\nJudiciary Rejects<br />\nLast Monday the Council Judiciary<br />\nCommittee turned down the proposal in the<br /><br />\nform of a 10-7 vote. The head of the Judiciary<br />\nCommittee, Councilman Reubin Kaplan, stressed<br />\nthe fact that the Tutorial Project \"is and always<br />\nhas been\" a voluntary organization. He<br />\ncontinued by saying that he saw no need to \"give<br />\nit money which would only bog it down in an<br />\nadministrative mess.\"<br />\nKaplan based his opinion on the<br />\ncontention that the money \"would only create<br />\njobs.\" He feels that the program has been<br />\nprogressing satisfactorily and that \"those<br />\nvolunteers don't need any more money.\"<br />\nAlthough the 0E0 appropriation would<br />\ncost neither Baltimore nor Maryland any extra<br />\nexpense, Mr. Kaplan adamantly refused to<br />\n\"waste\" the taxpayer's money. The financial<br />\nconsiderations,; do not appear to have been<br />\npredominant in the Councilman's mind, however.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that, at the same meeting,<br />\nthe Druid Hill Avenue Youth Training Center<br />\nwas given economic help and a similar bill,<br />\ninvolving an expendure of $62,500 for the Aid<br />\nfor the Elderly was sent back to committee.<br />\nThe Community Action Agency (CAA)<br />\nwhich is working closely with the tutorial<br />\nprogram, are now planning to go to Washington<br />\nin the hopes of gaining support for the 0E0<br />\ngrant. The general impression is not, however,<br />\noptimistic. They fear that the 0E0 will argue<br />\nthat if Baltimore doesn't care for the tutorial<br />\nproject then the Federal Government should not<br />\nprovide funds. James Farmer, Undersecretary of<br />\nHEW may intercede, however. He announced his<br />\ndecision to support the Tutorial project at a press<br />\nconference after his talk at Hopkins.

He stated that Mr. Bilgrave's office<br />\nwill be in charge of the Levering programs and will be responsible for<br />\nhandling the Levering and Chaplain's budget.<br />\nDean Kimball shared the views of Dr. Partridge arguing that<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office and Levering were student affairs and belonged<br />\nunder the control of the Office of Student Affairs. He said that there<br />\nwere really no long range problems because the questions of status<br />\nand future budget for the Chaplain's Office had already been<br />\ndecided. The status of the Chaplain's office would be that of anY<br />\nother student organization on campus and the budget would be<br />\napproved yearly by the regular University chain of command.<br />\nDr. Gryder, chairman of the Levering Board of Managers, was<br />\nnot willing to admit that major problems did not still exist. He said<br />\nthat the three proposals which had been sent to Dean Kimball<br />\nconcerning the status of the Chaplain were crucial to the Levering<br />\nprogram. He said that chaplains' offices at schools like Yale,<br />\nDartmouth, Howard, Middlebury and Stanford all reported directlY<br />\nto the president's office.

The Board wanted to<br />\nbase the budget on the actual expenditures of the second<br />\nhalf of 1968 rather than on the proposed expenditures<br />\nof the same period because the new Levering programs<br />\ndemended extra money if they were to be continued.<br />\nAt a second meeting, on January 29th, this group<br />\nworked out a tentative budget for the first half of 1969<br />\nwhich included requests for more than $27,000. This<br />\nrepresented a reduction of $3000 from the amount that<br />\nwas spent during the second half of 1968. This budget<br />\nwas given to Mr. Bilgrave who, in turn, submitted it to<br />\nDr. Partridge. Thus, the Board of Managers felt that the<br />\nbudget problems were settled for the present.<br />\nEarlier in January, the Board of Managers also<br />\nattempted to deal with the problem of the status of the<br />\nChaplain's Office. In a proposal sent to Dean Kimball on<br />\nJanuary 14th, the Board recommended that Chaplain<br />\nreport to the President or Provost that the Chaplain be<br />\ngiven tenure and that he have a board of student and<br />\nfaculty advisors. The Board felt that this proposal would<br />\nsolve the problem of Levering's status.<br />\nHowever, neither of the problems were solved in<br />\nfact. Dr. Partridge claimed that the budget submitted by<br />\nthe January 20th group was written on YMCA forms<br />\nrather than Hopkins forms and so he couldn't<br />\nunderstand them. He returned the forms to Mr.<br />\nBilgrave's office and then began writing to the Board of<br />\nManagers saying that he had received no budget.<br />\nAt the same time, Dean Kimball claimed that he<br />\nhad never seen the three proposals which were sent to<br />\nhim concerning the status of the Office of the Chaplain.<br />\nThroughout this period of'confusion and denials<br />\nLevering Hall continually tried to arrange meetings with<br />\nUniversity officials and Dr. Bevan tried to bring the<br />\nvarious groups together, but no meetings took place.<br />\n. Finally, on March 17th, Dr. Partridge met with Dr.<br />\nWickwire, Dr. Gryder, Mr. Bilgrave, Mr. Guerdon, Mr.<br />\nHughes and Joe Weinberg, former president of the<br />\nStudent Association. At this meeting, Dr. Partridge tried<br />\nto. straighten out the budget issue and indicted Dr.<br />\nWickwire for failing to submit a budget and for failure to<br />\nmeet and clear up the budget problems. After heated<br />\narguments on both sides, a tentative agreement was<br />\nreached and both YMCA and the University pledged<br />\nmore money to Levering. In return, Dr. Wickwire<br />\nPromised to review the proposed budget, which Mr.<br />\n1311grave's office had finally resubmitted, and cut it<br />\nWhere ever possible.<br />\nJOHN P.

The petition calls.<br />\nfor the reorganization of the course in<br />\norder to teach \"the basic elements of<br />\nthe second semester course in the short<br />\ntime remaining.\" It asks for more<br />\nconferences, even at the expense of the<br />\nlabs, which are \"irrelevant to the<br />\ncourse.\" A request is also made to have<br />\nhomework returned before the tests<br />\nwith a sheet demonstrating the correct<br /><br />\nprocedure for the solution. Another<br />\ndemand is to have the lectures replaced<br />\nby small conferences, which would go<br />\nbetter suited to the material. A request<br />\nwas made for a \"general review of the<br />\nquality of its (Chemistry's)introductory<br />\ncourses,\" and consultation of the<br />\ndepartment with the students in all final<br />\ndecisions.<br />\nLogan to Swanson to Koski<br />\nLipsey and Weinburg decided to<br />\ntake action after the books for the<br />\nsecond semester had not arrived by<br />\nMarch 7, only a week before the first<br />\ntest. They went to Mr. Logan, the<br />\nfreshman advisor, who advised them to<br />\nsee Dean Swanson. Swanson suggested<br />\nthat they prepare a petition of their<br />\ngrievances for presentation to Dr.<br />\nGordon. Finally, it was decided that the<br />\npetition should be submitted to Dr.<br />\nKoski. Dr. Koski responded to the<br />\npetition by calling a Wednesday<br />\nconference to include Lipsey, Weinburg,<br />\nDr. Cowan, Dr. Gryder, Dr. Paar, and<br />\nDr. Koski, to discuss the student<br />\ngrievances.<br />\nAmong the problems noted by the<br />\nstudents were the poor quality of the<br />\nconferences, the failure of the section<br />\nleaders to hand back assignments before<br />\nthe tests, and books and lectures which<br />\nare \"incomprehensible.\" The number of<br />\ndrops between the semesters this year<br />\nwas nearly twice the number in the last<br />\ntwo years, reflecting a serious deficiency<br />\nin the course. The main complaint is<br />\nthat the students aren't being taught<br /><br />\nanything. \"What we did last semester<br />\nwas done at Brown in two weeks,\"<br />\nWeinberg observed. \"I would think that<br />\na university which is as strong as<br />\nHopkins is supposed to be in chemistry,<br />\nwould be able to offer its<br />\nundergraduates more than it has,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nMuch of the controversy<br />\nsurrounds the text, written by Dr.<br />\nCowan, which is being used for the first<br />\ntime this year. The book, \"hastily<br />\nwritten,\" has a number of sections<br />\nwhich \"have been copied from other<br />\nbooks as evidenced by differing type<br />\ncharacters,\" charged Weinberg. The<br />\nbook also has a large number of<br />\nmathematical errors. Students feel that<br />\nalthough there is no math requirement<br />\nfor introduction chemistry, it is almost<br />\nimpossible to understand the derivations<br />\nwithout a knowledge of calculus.<br />\nGuesses and Intuition<br />\nComplaints have also been made<br />\nabout the lack of scientific rigor in the<br />\ncomposition of the book. This is<br />\ndemonstrated by statements as,<br />\n\"Intuition tells us a great deal about<br />\nB.\". \"A is an integration constant we<br />\ncan get rid of.\", and \"We now want to<br />\nguess the form of the functional<br />\nrelationship.\" Characteristic of the<br />\nprose style of the book is the sentence,<br />\n\"Although from an aesthetic point of<br />\nview semiempirical theory may not be<br />\nas satisfying as ab initio theory, it is<br />\nnevertheless an extremely fruitful way<br />\nto attack the problem.\"<br /><br />\nThe book was defended by Dr.<br />\nPaar, the chairman of the department<br />\nfor next year, as a possible \"step<br />\nforward in chemical education because<br />\nit employs a modern approach to<br />\nchemistry which is relatively severe in<br />\norder to challenge students in<br />\nappropriate places.\" He also pointed out<br />\nthat it was \"not as quantitative but<br />\nmore conceptual than the<br />\nKokes-Andrews book,\" which it<br />\nreplaces.<br />\nOrganic Next<br />\nThe students also hoped that their<br />\nconference with the chemistry faculty<br />\nwould spur change in the organic<br />\nchemistry course which many of them<br />\nwill be taking next year. The text for<br />\norganic has been characterized by a<br />\nstudent presently enrolled in the course<br />\nas \"trivial information which doesn t<br />\nexplain anything.\" The lectures are<br />\n\"poorly attended and boring with Dr.<br />\nCorwin often lapsing into irrelevant<br />\npersonal rememberances.\" The tests<br />\ncover \"trivialities which you try to<br />\nforget as soon as the test is over.\" The<br />\nstudents' immediate concern, however,<br />\nis, with the freshman course in which<br />\nthey are presently \"confined.\"<br />\nHELP!!!!<br />\nWriters are needed to work on<br />\nthe sports staff of the News-Letter.

The<br />\nof the latest dispute is a tangled one\u2014hopefully disentangled by<br />\n9, ur news story in this issue. The principal topics of dispute are the<br />\nLevering budget and its status in the University structure. The only point<br />\n\u00b0I\u2018 contention which seems to be solved at this date is that the University<br />\n'las arranged to see that Levering's budgetary committments for January<br />\nto June, 1969; are met.<br />\nWe urge that Hopkins administrators adopt two courses of action:<br />\nthat Levering's request to be placed directly under the President's Office<br />\nbe approved, and that every consideration be given to Levering's budget<br />\nrequests for 1969-70.<br />\nLevering's programs\u2014tutoring, AWARE, movies, to name a few\u2014are<br />\nth most<br />\n,e<br />\nambitious and far-reaching activities of any organization on the<br />\nuomewood campus. The business flowing through the offices of Levering<br />\nClosely rivals that of the Office of Student Affairs, itself. The importance<br />\nof Levering's programs demand that they be allowed to continue at their<br />\nPresent level with sufficient room for expansion.<br />\nTo place an organization as large as Levering under the jurisdiction<br />\nof the Office of Student Affairs is ludicrous.

Putting the Levering<br />\ncomplex directly under the President would be structurally more efficient<br />\nand would give Levering's directors more leeway in instituting changes.<br />\nFor similar reasons, we urge the University to do its utmost in<br />\nensuring that Levering Hall receives enough funding to support all its<br />\npresent and planned programs. Levering's past record shows that its<br />\nefforts on Homewood and in the city have been creative, productive and<br />\nwell worth the funds it has received\u2014more than can be said for other<br />\ncampus groups.<br />\nIn short, we have complete faith in Dr. Wickwire, the Levering<br />\nBoard of Managers, and the student directors of the Student Association.<br />\nWe feel that their proposals concerning the future of Levering Hall should<br />\nbe approved.<br /><br />\n...<br /><br />\nContinue<br /><br />\nThe City Council's decision to withhold approval of the Community<br />\nAction Agency's request for Federal aid again points up the strange<br />\nrelationship between the people and their elected representatives. Instead<br />\nof funding the Tutorial Project, a clearly responsible and highly successful<br />\noperation, the Council has reduced itself to political maneuvering of the<br />\nlowest and most contemptible order. Instead of serving the needs of the<br />\npeople of Baltimore, Councilman Kaplan's committee has seen fit to assert<br />\nits power over the \"defenseless\" groups in the city\u2014the Blacks and the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nKaplan, moreover, has the audacity, in this age of astronomical<br />\ngovernment spending to emphasize the need for \"holding the line\" on the<br />\nTutorial's request for $64,000 to continue a program aimed at combatting<br />\nthe disadvantaged educational status of deprived Baltimore students.<br />\nMoreover, the funds in question will be eventually allocated anyway, and<br />\nit is regrettable that the Council has bypassed an opportunity to put the<br />\nmoney to productive use in Baltimore.<br />\nIn no way do Kaplan's arguments make sense. Even with the 0E0<br />\nmoney, the Tutorial will be run as inexpensively as possible. It enables<br />\nstudent energy to be used productively and builds rapport between<br />\nhitherto antagonistic elements - white middle class students and Inner City<br />\nblacks. We think these are worthwhile goals. Does Mr. Kaplan?<br />\nWe urge Dr. Gordon and other concerned officials to immediately<br />\nmobilize whatever influence they can to ensure that the S.A.

In the Parliaments of England, France, Belgium<br />\nand Italy, and in the Japanese Diet, it was reported that<br />\nAmerica's war plans included a provision for packing off<br />\nall domestic \"subversives\" to concentration camps.<br />\nThe extensive discussions were touched off by an<br />\narticle in the Sept. 13, 1952 issue of the British journal,<br />\nNew Statesman and Nation. In \"Concentration Camps in<br />\nthe U.S.?\" Charles R. Allen, an American, told of his<br />\nvisit to the Allenwood (Pa.) Federal Prison, one of six<br />\n\"detention camps\" set aside under the Internal Security<br />\nAct of 1950. Then he interviewed Col. Guy C. Rexroad,<br />\nthe superintendent.<br />\nRexroad revealed that his camp was prepared to<br />\naccomodate some 4-7,000 \"detainees.\" Women and<br />\nchildren included? \"Yes, kids, too, maybe...But maybe<br />\nnobody will come here. God, I hope not. But what<br />\nshould we do in case of war? As I understand it, those<br />\npeople would overthrow the government by force and<br />\nviolence if we didn't put them away.\"<br />\nThe rumor is spreading again. For a year and a half<br />\nthe threat of concentration camps has constantly been<br />\nsounded by H. Rap Brown of the Student Non-Violent<br />\nCoordinating Committee. To the blacks, the new left,<br />\nthe hippies,it all once more seems real. They aren't the<br />\nonly ones.<br />\nIn 1968 such conservative metropolitan dailies as<br />\nthe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the Washington \u2022Evening<br />\nStar and the Milwaukee Journal took editorial notice of<br />\na proposal by the House Committee on Un-American<br />\nActivities to use the camps should the \"need\" arise. A<br />\nLook article reported that \"the basic bleak theme of<br />\nmass imprisonment is consistent\u2014and consistently<br />\nspreading\u2014coast to coast.\"<br />\nEmergency Detention Act<br />\nIs the rumor fOunded in the wish-fulfillment<br />\nfantasies of a masochistic left\u2014or is there substance to it?<br />\nThe law at issue is Title II of the Internal Security<br />\nAct. Commonly called \"the Emergency Detention Act,\"<br />\nTitle II gives the President of the United States power to<br />\nproclaim an internal security emergency in the event of<br />\n\"any one of the following: (I) invasion of the territory<br />\nof the United States or its possessions;(2) delcaration of<br />\nwar by Congress; or (3) insurrection within the United<br />\nStates in .d of a foreign enemy.\"<br />\nWhen this national emergency is declared, \"the<br />\nPresident, acting through the Attorney General, is<br />\nhereby authorized to apprehend and by order<br />\ndetain...each person as to whom there is reasonable<br />\nground to believe that such person probably will engage<br />\nin, or probably will conspire with others to engage in,<br />\nacts of espionage or of sabotage.\"<br />\nDetention is prescribed for anyone holding<br />\nmembership since January 1, 1949, in the Communist<br />\nParty, USA,or \"any other organization or political party<br />\nwhich seeks to overthrow or destroy by force and<br />\nviolence the Government of the United States or any of<br />\nits political subdivisions.\"<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nThe law provides that the detainee be given a<br />\nhearing, without right of bail, before a \"preliminary<br />\nhearing officer,\" whose decision can be appealed<br />\nthrough a \"Detention Review Board.\" Contrary to all<br />\nnorms ofjudicial procedure, at no stage in the case is the<br />\nAttorney General \"required to furnish information the<br />\nrevelation of which would disclose the identity or<br />\nevidence of government agents or officers which he<br />\nbelieves it would be dangerous to national safety and<br />\nsecurity to divulge.\" That is to say, concrete evidence<br />\nneed not be presented on the nebulous excuse of<br />\n\"national security\", whatever that might mean in the<br />\nminds of those who wish to make the case. The burden<br />\nof proof lies with the defence not the prosecution. The<br />\nroles remain reversed through all appellate stages.<br />\nSection 104 (c) of Title II provides that the<br />\ndetainee be \"confined in such places of detention as may<br />\nbe prescribed by the Attorney General.\" Accordingly,<br />\nsites for the \"detention- camp program\" were set aside<br />\nin 1952 on a \"standby basis.\" In addition to Allenwood,<br />\nthere were sites picked in Tule Lake, Calif.; Avon Park,<br />\nFla.; El Reno, Okla.; and Wickenberg and Florence, Ariz.<br />\nViolates Constitution<br />\nThe constitutionality of Title II is, to be<br />\ncharitable, highly questionable. Potentially, the act<br />\nviolates: (1)the First Amendment by being overly broad<br />\nand vague, thereby inhibiting the exercise of speech and<br />\nassembly rights; (2) the Fourth Amendment by<br />\nauthorizing deprivation of liberty upon suspicion rather<br />\nthan \"probable cause\" and by authorizing detention<br />\nwithout judicial safeguards;(3)the Fifth Amendment by<br />\nauthorizing incarceration solely because of membership<br />\nin a political party;(4)the Fifth and Sixth Amendments<br />\nby authorizing punishment without trial, by denying the<br />\ndetainee the right to confront his accusers and to<br />\ncross-examine the witnesses against him, and by too<br />\nseverly restricting the scope of judicial review; (5) the<br />\nEighth Amendment by imposing cruel and unusual<br />\npunishment where no crime has been committed and by<br />\nproviding for indefinite detention without the right to<br />\nbail.<br />\nIn an article appearing in the January, 1962,<br />\nMinority of One, ACLU Legal Director Melvin L. Wulf<br />\nquestioned the facade of procedural safeguards provided<br />\nby the law. He hazarded \"that it will be far easier to get<br />\ninto one of our detention camps than to get out.\"<br />\nDescribing the procedure of appeals as a \"Kafkaesque<br />\njourney,\" he found the anti-Communist provision<br />\nparticularly striking\u2014\"a provision of a simplicity defying<br />\nthe manifold efforts of lawyers, scholars and jurists over<br />\nseveral hundred years to distribute fairly between the<br />\naccused and society the benefits and burdens of a just<br />\nsystem of criminal law.\"<br />\nThought Control Business<br />\nPresident Harry S.Truman was less restrained. In<br />\nvetoing the act, Truman declared, \"It would put the<br />\nGovernment of the United States in the thought control<br />\nbusiness. ..No considerations of expediency can justify<br />\nthe enactment of such a bill as this, a bill which would<br />\nso greatly weaken our liberties and give aid and comfort<br />\nto those who would destroy us.\"<br /><br />\nMore critical still was North Dakota Senator<br />\nWilliam Langer, who observed,\"So it is now proposed to<br />\nhave concentration camps in America! We can be<br />\nabsolutely certain that the concentration camps are for<br />\nonly one purpose: namely, to put in them the kind of<br />\npeople those in authority do not like!\"<br />\nSenator Karl Mundt, hardly noted for his softness<br />\non Communism, pointed out that the Act provided for<br />\n\"concentration camps into which people might be put<br />\nwithout benefit of trial, but merely by an executive<br />\nfiat. ..simply by an assumption, mind you, that an<br />\nindividual might be thinking about engaging in espionage<br />\nor sabotage.\"<br />\nEven Senator Pat McCarren, author of the parent<br />\nbill, termed Title II \"a concentration camp measure,<br />\npure and simple.\"<br />\nAre we capable of using the Emeigency Detention<br />\nAct? While the horror of Nazi Germany still haunts our<br />\nmemory, we conveniently avoid thinking about the<br />\n\"relocation\" camps for Japanese-Americans during<br />\nWorld War II. The Federal government in 1942 arrested,<br />\nconfiscated the property of and granted no hearings to<br />\nor redress for some 119,000 Issei (Japanese-born<br />\nimmigrants) and Nisei (second generation<br />\nJapanese-Americans.) In the course of the war against<br />\nthe Axis powers, not one case of espionage or aid to the<br />\nenemy could be traced to a Japanese-American.<br />\nFour years after we rounded up our Japanese, we<br />\ndenounced the Nazi concentration camps. Four years<br />\nafter Nuremburg we passed the Emergency Detention<br />\nAct.<br />\nJ. Walter Yeagley, head of the Internal Security<br />\nDivision of the Justice Department during the Johnson<br />\nAdministration, became irritated with all the talk about<br />\nconcentration camps and determined to put a stop to it.<br />\nInquirers at Yeagley's office received a form letter<br />\ndenying the existence of any such camps on a ready-alert<br />\nfor prospective tenants.<br />\nShabby Shape<br />\nYeagley's form letter made much of the fact that<br />\nno funds have been allocated to maintain the camps<br />\nsince 1957 and, further, that the camps have been<br />\ndiscontinued as \"detention centers.\" Five of the six<br />\ncamps have been placed in the jurisdiction of the U.S.<br />\nBureau of Prisons and serve as minimum security<br />\nprisons. The sixth, at Tule Lake, has been subdivided<br />\namong local residents.<br />\nHowever, in each case the Federal government<br />\nretains the right to re-enter on 24 hours notice. It will<br />\ncontinue to hold this right as long as Title II is the law of<br />\nthe land. The question of allocation of separate funds to<br />\nmaintain the camps is irrelevant: They obviously are<br />\nbudgeted through the Bureau of Prisons. True, the<br />\ncamps are in shabby shape. But that Will not deter those<br />\nwho wish to use them.<br />\nInternal Insurrection<br />\nCharles Allen visited the six original sites two years<br />\nago.

Most striking is<br />\nBryan's endorsement of Constitutional<br />\nAmendments XVI-XIX.<br />\nHowever, there has been less<br />\nattention to Bryan's role in expanding<br />\nthe electoral base of the Democratic<br />\nparty. Specifically, Bryan's ability to<br />\nbreak resistance to the Democratic<br />\nparty in the Far West helped pave the<br />\nway for Woodrow Wilson's marginal<br />\nre-election in 1916.<br />\nPrior to Bryan's nomination in<br />\n1896, the Democratic party rarely<br />\ncarried a Far Western state in a<br />\nPresidential election. Grover Cleveland,<br />\nthe Democratic nominee in the three<br />\nelections preceding 1896, usually ran<br />\nwell behind in this region and had his<br />\nprincipal success in carrying California,<br />\nwhich he had lost twice, in 1892.<br />\nIndeed, in 1892 the Democrats yielded<br />\ntheir place on the ballot in Colorado,<br />\nIowa and Wyoming to Populist<br />\ncandidate General James Weaver.<br />\nNew York Nominees<br />\nThe Democrats had based their<br /><br />\nPresidential electoral hopes on a<br />\ncombination of the solid South and a<br />\nfew large states in the East and Midwest.<br />\nFrom 1868 to 1892, all but one of the<br />\nDemocratic nominees was from New<br />\nYork, seeking the biggest electoral prize<br />\nin the Union. The other candidate,<br />\nGeneral Winfield Scott Hancock in<br />\n1880, was a Pennsylvanian.<br />\nBryan in 1896 sought to win<br />\nthrough a different route: a solid<br />\nelectoral coalition of the still-solid<br />\nSouth, the Far West and the agricultural<br />\nand industrial Midwest while conceding<br />\nto the Republicans New England and<br />\nthe North Central states.<br />\nBryan came closest to success in<br />\n1896, when he was badly beaten in the<br />\nElectoral College, 271 to 176. Bryan's<br />\nvictory chances fell apart because he<br />\ncould not carry the large Midwestern<br />\nstates, and even lost a close race in<br />\nCalifornia. However, he carried most of<br />\nthe Rocky Mountain states, thus<br />\nbreaking those states' longstanding<br />\nresistance to Democratic Presidential<br />\nnominees.<br />\nWestern Hard Core<br />\nBryan's two subsequent<br />\ncampaigns, his Western strength<br /><br />\ngradually receded and the Solid South<br />\ncame to represent a greater portion of<br />\nhis total electoral vote. Nevertheless, he<br />\nmaintained a hard core of Western<br />\nsupport which would be of advantage to<br />\nlater Democratic candidates.<br />\nFor instance, in 1908 Bryan<br />\nreceived about 34% of the vote while<br />\nlosing Oregon to William Howard Taft.<br />\nIn 1912, due to the party split between<br />\nTaft and Theodore Roosevelt, Democrat<br />\nWoodrow Wilson carried Oregon. But<br />\nthe combined Republican strength<br />\nremained at its level of 1908, and<br />\nWilson actually received Bryan's share<br />\nof the vote, 34%.<br />\nIn 1912, the Republican split was<br />\nso profound that Wilson received 435<br />\nelectoral votes and carried every region<br />\nof the country. In 1916, however, the<br />\nRepublicans nominated a tough ticket.<br />\nCharles Evans Hughes, formerly<br />\nSupreme Court Associate Justice and<br />\nGovernor of New York, ran for<br />\nPresident and former Vice President<br />\nCharles Fairbanks of Indiana ran for<br />\nVice President.<br />\nWilson was behind in most of the<br />\nEast and industrial Midwest. To win,<br />\nWilson had to form an electoral<br />\ncoalition of the Solid South, the Far<br /><br />\nWest and some of the Middle West. In<br />\nother words, he had to execute<br />\nsuccessfully the strategy that had thrice<br />\nfailed Bryan.<br />\nBut Wilson was actually building<br />\non the pioneering work of Bryan. Had<br />\nWilson had to commence the job of<br />\nbreaking Far Western influence to<br />\nDemocratic candidates, it is doubtful<br />\nthat he could have finished the job in<br />\nthe short space of the campaign of<br />\n1916.<br />\n1916 proved that, under certain<br />\ncircumstances, Bryan's original electoral<br />\nstrategy could barely succeed. Hughes<br />\ncut a swath through the Eastern<br />\nseaboard and added the Midwestern<br />\nindustrial states, with the single major<br />\nexception of Ohio.<br />\nHowever, Wilson succeeded in the<br />\nmonotonously Solid South, and the<br />\nWestern states, save Oregon, voted<br />\nsolidly for him. California, which had<br />\nnever voted Democratic for President<br />\nsince 1892, was in doubt through<br />\nElection Night before swinging its<br />\nthirteen electoral votes to Wilson.<br />\nCalifornia made the difference in the<br />\nelection as the final Electoral College<br />\nvote was 277 for Wilson and 254 for<br />\nHughes.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAR. 21, 1969<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nHopkins,Goucher Film Festival Audiences Dead<br />\nBy ELLIOT KRIEGER<br />\nTake one, two, Maryland Film<br />\nFestival three...third film festival, at<br />\nthree schools, in three parts, and no<br />\none, no one could figure out the<br />\nschedules: Thursday night somewhere it<br />\nstarted and ended somewhere Sunday<br />\nbut not everywhere, with all shows at<br />\n8:30 (with some exceptions), plus<br />\nrumors that the shows at Hopkins were<br />\nfor free (unfounded) that the shows at<br />\nthe Institute were two crowded<br />\n(nothing is too crowded),) that the<br />\nShows at Goucher were empty (not full<br />\nanyway).<br />\nMost of the films were from New<br />\nYork, many from Maryland, the winner<br />\narid most of the best films were from<br />\nCalifornia, one from North Dakota,<br />\nundoubtedly the most obscure state in<br />\nthe union.

B.<br />\nKing!\"<br />\nAnd from stage left strode the man himself, his red<br />\nguitar at his side, towards the mike. Big, old, and stocky,<br />\nwith years of cheap Southern jook joints, and grimy<br />\none-night stands behind him, he turned towards his<br />\nwhite audience, and sang,\"Everyday I have the blues....\"<br />\nFrom that moment, the audience was his. With a casual<br />\nflock of the knobs on his big guitar, he plucked the first<br />\nsweet, clear, and poignant note, bringing out a low sigh<br />\nfrom the audience.<br />\nAfter each line he sang, he played a few nimble<br />\nriffs, and when the time came for the guitar break, lie<br />\nshowed everyone why he is considered the best blues<br />\nguitarist in America. With blinding speed and agility, he<br />\nzipped up and down the neck of the guitar, confidently<br />\ngetting from it high-pitched wailings, or low, blucsy<br />\nmoans.<br />\nSuperb Musicmanship<br /><br />\nWhen he finished the first number, the audience<br />\nresponded with delighted howls of appreciation. With a<br />\nquick \"thank you\", he went-right into the next number,<br />\nan up-tempo shuffle blues. With good solid backing from<br />\nthe sax and trumpet, lie played a series of quick, jazzy<br />\nriffs. In the next few numbers he indulged in a little<br />\nold-fashioned showmanship, including playing the guitar<br />\nonly with the left hand, and holding out the guitar and<br />\nletting the note waver for twelve bars.<br />\nHis singing was in a slick Jimmy Rushing,<br />\nKansas-City blues style, rather than in a gravelly voiced<br />\nChicago blues mode. He used some old-time singing<br />\nhistrionics, like clenched hands and upraised arms,<br />\nreminiscent of early jazz singers. But B. B. King doesn't<br />\nhave to smash his guitar, set his hair on fire, or take off<br />\nhis pants to attract attention. His superb musicmanship<br />\ndoes it for him. When he finished, after introducing \"the<br />\ngirl I never go anywhere without, my guitar, Lucille,\"<br />\nthe entire crowd rose to its feet in a cheering ovation for<br />\nthe King, B. B. King.<br />\nCan't Top the King<br />\nB. B. King was followed by the British blues<br />\ngroup, the Jeff Beck Group, a skinny and emaciated<br />\nbunch of speedfreaks. Beck is a good guitarist, but the<br />\nlead singer is a screaming faggot who minces around the<br />\nstage like Tiny Tim. They're good on record, but terrible<br />\non stage.<br />\nThe show was closed by Canned Heat, a group<br />\nadept at resurrecting old blues numbers, but not much<br />\nelse. They ended their set with an incredibly long and<br />\nunimaginative \"Refried Boogie, which pointed up only<br />\nthat Canned Heat are singularly incapable of inventive<br />\nimprovisation. The best thing about the group is<br />\nprobably the lead singer's blues disk collection, one of<br />\nthe finest in the nation.<br />\nUnquestionably the main problem with the two<br />\nwhite blues groups was that they had an impossible act<br />\nto follow.

If approached in an<br />\nopen, experimental manner, really exciting<br />\nadditions may be made to the academic<br />\nexperience of both students and faculty.<br />\nUnfortunately, if the mood of Friday's meeting<br />\nis any indication, the faculty is not eager to<br />\nexplore these possibilities.<br />\nThis reluctance on the part of the faculty is<br />\nonly one example of the conservative and elitist<br />\nattitude that seemed widespread at Friday's<br />\nmeeting. Much recent writing on the crisis in<br />\nhigher education has emphasized that the<br />\ngreatest resistance to meaningful reform lies not<br />\nin a benighted administration, but in the vested<br />\ninterests of the faculty.<br />\nThe truth of this insight was never more<br />\nevident than last Friday. Discussion of even the<br />\nmost modest reforms never attempted to<br />\nchallenge the validity of established notions, but<br />\nrather centered around how these notions could<br />\nbest be applied to the proposed new situation.<br />\nBut more serious than this unwillingness to<br />\nconsider change was the emergence of an attitude<br />\ntoward the student body that at best was<br />\ndegradingly paternalistic, and at worst viciously<br />\ncontemptuous.<br />\nWhat kind of education can students<br />\nexpect from men who accuse them of being<br />\n\"high-handed\" in desiring closer personal contact<br />\nwith their instructors? Are students and faculty<br />\nreally strange bedfellows? Who, then, should,<br />\nmake academic decisions, if not those directly<br />\naffected by them?<br /><br />\nIndeed, the concept of academic freedom,<br />\nwhich was trotted out innumerable times at<br />\nFriday's meeting, seems to be defined by a<br />\nsignificant number of the Hopkins faculty as<br />\nfollows: professors are free to teach what they<br />\nwant, when they want, and how they want,<br />\nwithout regard for student opinion. Students are<br />\nfree only to take the professors' courses or not<br />\n(and even this momentary freedom is denied to<br />\nthem!), but once they step inside the classroom<br />\ndoor, they are free only to be obediant<br />\nschoolboys.<br />\nFor an instant on Friday, the students<br />\nappeared to shed their schoolboy roles, and the<br />\nfaculty's righteous indignation was an<br />\nappropriate response, it seems, given the realities<br />\nof the Hopkins educational atmosphere.<br />\nStudents, do you want to be schoolboys<br />\nfor the rest of your university life? Faculty, can<br />\nyou honestly teach in a coercive and intimidating<br />\nenvironment? Faculty and student, are you<br />\nsatisfied that true education is possible at<br />\nHopkins without radical change?<br />\nWe, graduate students and faculty of the<br />\nNew University Conference, answer these<br />\nquestions with a loud and clear \"No!\" We ask<br />\nyou to join us in the coming months in<br />\ndiscussion and exploration not only of the<br />\npossibilities of the January interim period, but of<br />\nthe decision-making process and educational<br />\nstructure of the University. No one - students,<br />\nfaculty, or administration - should be satisfied<br />\nwith the way calendar reform was presented and<br />\ndecided upon. In order to avoid similar situations<br />\nin the future, let us begin now to explore and<br />\ndevelop the means to liberate the educational<br />\nexperience at Hopkins for the entire University<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nNEW UNIVERSITY CONFERENCE<br /><br />\n(Continued on Page 9)<br /><br />\nBut who knew what this<br />\nwas?

For the<br />\nfirst time, the Student Council, speaking for the<br />\nundergraduate student body, brought clearly into focus<br />\nsuite significant questions about the nature of Hopkins<br />\nas an educational institution. Furthermore, in this effort,<br />\nit elicited a positive response from the administration<br />\nand the faculty that signifies that, perhaps, Hopkins as<br />\nan institution is finally ready to begin fulfilling its<br />\nresponsibilities to undergraduate education at a level<br />\ncommensurate with that which it has towards graduate<br />\neducation and research.<br />\nIn more precise terms, the specific issue about<br />\nWhich I am talking is the new academic calendar. The<br />\nrecent events\u2014the initial letter to President Gordon, the<br />\nstrike threat, the follow up meetings with President<br />\nGordon and the members of the Academic Council, and,<br />\nfinally, the meeting of the General Assembly of the<br />\nFaculty\u2014that explain how this particular issue unfolded<br />\nare all well known.<br />\nHowever, I would suggest that there is a larger<br />\nlesson to be learned from these events and that this<br /><br />\nparticular issue is merely the specific at-hand issue that<br />\nsymbolizes a much larger one.<br />\nForceful Stand<br />\nThe larger lesson to which I refer centers on the<br />\nwhole notion of what a student-faculty confrontation is<br />\nand how it should be handled. To be direct, I think that<br />\nHopkins, its students, and its faculty should be proud<br />\nbecause they have demonstrated, in the most real sense<br />\nof the word, that a campus confrontation\u2014no matter<br />\nwho it is between\u2014need not resort to violence in order to<br />\nbe resolved, and it has done this at a time when violence<br />\nseems to be the popular order of the day.<br />\nThe students took a forceful stand that brought<br />\nrapid and dramatic attention to the issue. They then<br />\nproceeded to pursue the issue on its merits, to<br />\ndemonstrate responsibly the breadth of their support,<br />\nand to express their position cogently and firmly, at all<br />\ntimes appealing to the reason and rationality of those<br />\ninvolved. At no time did they allow their position to be<br />\nweakened with unnecessary and provocative threats, nor<br />\ndid they succumb to the simplistic temptation that<br />\nquick and easy victory would come through the use of<br />\nuncontrolled force.<br /><br />\nBy the same token, the administration and the<br />\nfaculty responded in a genuine manner. They<br />\ndemonstrated, at every step of the way, a measure of<br />\ngood will, showed an awareness of the legitimacy of the<br />\nstudent position, and reacted intelligently to the<br />\nresponsibility of the student conduct. The final result<br />\nwas a victory. For whom? I would say,\"For all,\"\u2014for all<br />\nbecause no one has lost, and all have gained a somewhat<br />\nlarger measure of confidence in the good faith and'<br />\nreasonableness of the others.<br />\nConcern is Present<br />\nThere is one other lesson that must be noted from<br />\nthis issue, and that lesson is what this issue really<br />\nsymbolizes in terms of undergraduates' thinking about<br />\ntheir position in this University. The underlying notion<br />\nof the student position throughout this debate was the<br />\nbelief that this was more than just simply a physical<br />\nreform of the calendar, that this was a partial<br />\neducational reform for the University, a first step that<br />\nshowed that the faculty and administration were truly<br />\nconcerned with upgrading the quality of education for<br />\nthe undergraduates to a level equal to the very high level<br />\nof graduate study and research.

He<br />\nsaid that neither the University nor the YMCA had<br />\nconsidered the programs that were involved in the<br />\nLevering controversy but had treated the whole affair<br />\nonly as a financial question. He said that he had to<br />\nconclude that the University's chain of command did<br />\nnot work effectively and that the University had failed<br />\nto appreciate the value of the tutoring programs and<br />\nOther Levering projects. This showed that the University<br />\nPut considerations of a purely budgetary nature before<br />\nconsiderations of student needs.<br />\nThe University's lack of interest in the whole<br />\nProblem of Levering Hall and its programs was also<br />\nemphasized by Dr. Wickwire. He said that his attempts<br />\nto setup meetings with various administrators on the<br />\nLevering Hall issue had met with continual disinterest.<br />\nHe also felt that a Chaplain cannot be effective if he has<br />\nto receive permission from three or four levels of<br />\nCommand before he can act on any problem.<br />\nChaplain Responsible<br />\nand Dr. Wickwire pointed out<br />\nGryder<br />\nBoth Dr.<br />\nthat the University Chaplain was responsible to the<br />\nWhole university and was not just a service provided for<br />\nthe students. The Chaplain's conserns should range<br />\nacross the entire spectrum of university activities and so<br />\nhe should have a great deal of flexibility to respond and<br />\nto serve. In the view of both men, the proposal to put<br />\nthe Chaplain and his budget under the control of the<br />\nOffice of Student Affairs would not provide the<br />\nnecessary flexibility.<br />\nThree students who have been involved in the<br />\nLevering Hall controversy, Jim Archibald, SA president,<br />\nJoe Weinberg, former SA president, and Jim Cleary,<br /><br />\nMR. ROBERT BILGRAVE, DIRECTOR OF STUDENT<br />\nAffairs felt that once the funds for a transitionary period<br />\nwere found, all difficulties with Levering Flail would be<br />\nsolved.<br /><br />\nstudent director of the SA tutoring program, all agreed<br />\nthat the problems of status and budget were crucial and<br />\nthey agreed that the University's proposal to put<br />\nLevering under the control of Student Affairs would<br />\nseverely limit the present programs and would be a real<br />\ndetriment to the development of any new programs.<br />\nArchibald argued that the University has always<br />\nrefused to cooperate in any whole-hearted manner with<br />\nLevering. He said that the Office of Student Affairs<br />\nwould suppress new programs of any real substance and<br />\nthat the Chaplain's Office had to have its own budget if<br />\nit was going to get anything done.<br /><br />\nDR. ALLYN KIMBALL, DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF<br />\nARTS AND SCIENCE, indicated that he was unaware of<br />\nattempts by Dr. Wickwire to establish contacts with the<br />\nAdministration.<br /><br />\nJoe Weinberg also stressed that the Chaplain's<br />\noffice has to be free of all unnecessary administrative<br />\ncontrols. Both he and Archibald pointed out that many<br />\nother leading universities put their chaplains' offices<br />\nunder the president and give them substantial autonomy.<br />\nWeinberg further stated that the Administrations has<br />\nlittle idea of how the Levering I hill programs are run.<br />\n\"In addition, the Administration has consistantly<br />\nrefused to make any attempt to seriously analyze the<br />\nneeds and impact of the programs, and they seem to he<br />\nmore inclined to issue dicta without facts.\"<br /><br />\nNew Minority Enterprise Office Raises Booker T. Spectre<br />\nBy DAVID MELAMED<br />\nThe Nixon administration created government<br />\nmachinery last week to foster a program of \"minority<br />\nenterprise\" previously known as \"black capitalism\".<br />\n\"To foster the economic status and pride of<br />\nmembers of our minority groups,\" stated the President,<br />\nwe must seek to involve them more fully in our private<br />\nenterprise system.\" However, the chances of success for<br />\nthis program were judged as \"almost nil\" by Dr. David<br />\nDonald, a noted expert in the field of Southern History.<br />\nNo Real Change<br />\nDr. Lou Stettler, who along with Professors<br />\nSparrow and Oakland studied the economics of black<br />\nCapitalism, felt that Nixon's program will raise the<br />\nincomes of some black people and the opportunities of<br />\nMany others, but will not substantially alter the<br />\neconomic status of the black community.<br />\nThe new program involves the creation of an<br />\nOffice of Minority Business Enterprise to be staffed by<br />\nexperts in banking, business, and foundation work, along<br />\nWith \"a black man and a Mexican-American to deal with<br />\nthe minority communities.\" Nixon's statement described<br />\nthis office as \"the focal point of the administration's<br />\nefforts to assist the establishment of new minority<br />\nenterprises and expansion of existing ones.\"<br />\nUnder the direction of the Secretary of<br />\nCommerce, Maurice Stans, the new office will<br />\ncoordinate the 116 existing programs scattered through<br />\n21 federal departments and agencies which are or could<br /><br />\nbe used to help minority-group business. The office will<br />\n\"seek to concentrate government resources, and also to<br />\ninvolve the business community and others in order to<br />\nenlist the full range of the nation's resources.\"<br />\nThe program Nixon is creating, according to<br />\nProfessor Donald, \"is exactly what Booker T.<br />\nWashington wanted back in the 1880's.\" This too, was a<br />\ntime of \"heightened racial tensions\" \u2014 any opportunities<br />\nwhich Reconstruction had opened up for the black man<br />\nwere now closed. Washington felt that the Negro's \"only<br />\nsalvation was a kind of withdrawal \u2014 to build a parallel<br />\nsociety; the most valuable thing was to have a skill or to<br />\nopen one's own enterprise.\"<br />\nThe idea, explained Dr. Donald,\"didn't work then<br />\nand has even less chance of working today.\" The plans<br />\nof both President Nixon and Booker T. Washington<br />\ninvolve the creation of small enterprises such as the<br />\ncorner grocery store. \"In our society these are dying<br />\ninstitutions. Their chances of being successfully<br />\nestablished are slim \u2014 they cannot compete with national<br />\nfirms.\"<br />\n\"It is a hopelessly formidable kind of<br />\nundertaking,\" concluded Dr. Donald, \"because for a<br />\nblack man with little management experience opening a<br />\nbusiness in a crime infested area, credit is so difficult to<br />\nget. It is an unimaginative, cheap program which requires<br />\nlittle investment of time or money. If I were a Negro I<br />\nwould be more discouraged now that I would have been<br />\nat any time since 1954.\"<br /><br />\nIS THIS YOU?<br />\nI am opposed to the Viet Nam War (and any such war that is not based upon defense of our<br />\nCountry).

It is often argued that the cause<br />\nis the lack of skill of minority group members. The<br />\nprogram is setting up training sessions in an effort to<br />\nreduce the learning costs.<br />\nIt is also argued that the problem has been the<br />\nhigh cost of credit for black entrepreneurs due to the<br />\nit<br />\nsituation and actual discrimination.

There is just not enough money to go around. It<br />\nis not my intention to emphasize the sensational aspects of<br />\nthe problem involved in raising money for post-season<br />\nplay, but rather to report the existance .of this deplorable<br />\nsituation and offer constructive criticism where possible.<br />\nThis subject has been brought to my attention by the attempts<br />\nof Charlie Goddell of the Booster Club and other interested students<br />\nto raise noney to send seven of the varsity swimmers to the NCAA<br />\nCollege Division Swimming Championships (March 20-22) at<br />\nSpringfield, Mass. The Booster Club, which has raised money on<br />\nseveral occasions in the past, has been trying to scrape up the<br />\nnecessary $600 to send our tankmen to the nationals.<br />\nAccompanying the swimmers are Coach Comfort and manager Josh<br />\nTreem (who has, by the way, offered to pay his own way).<br />\nComfort Estimates<br />\nCoach Comfort conservatively estimates that it will cost $75<br />\nper person accounting for the $600 total. This per capita breaks<br />\ndown as follows; $20 for transportation, $21 for motel (one of the<br />\nleast expensive available), $24 total for food, and $10 for general<br />\nexpenses.<br />\nAs of presstime, $536.35 has been raised. Of this, $200 comes<br />\nfrom Mr. Bilgrave's contingency fund, $191.35 comes from<br />\nlifeguarding that the swimmers have done themselves, $75 from the<br />\nH-Club, Beta and Phi Gam each donated $25. Ten dollars came from<br />\nalumni, and Col. Serena said that he would kick in ten dollars.<br />\nChange in Philosophy Needed<br />\nThe philosophy of the University since the days of Dean<br />\nShaffer has been that the Hop will not finance post-season<br />\ncompetitions; however, recent recommendations of the Athletic<br />\nCommittee have urged that this policy be changed. This is a step in<br />\nthe right direction, yet the suggestion did not solve the problem<br />\nfaced by this year's crop of nationally qualified swimmers.<br />\nIt seems a shame that these swimmers work and toil all season,<br />\nor, as in the case of Howie Chernick for three years and then are<br />\ndeserted by the Administration at the conclusion of the regular<br />\nseason. These swimmers have excelled to the point of qualifying for<br />\nnational competition and such outstanding achievement should be<br />\nencouraged. Whether the University wants to admit it or not, half<br />\nthe swimming team has qualified for the nationals and this is truly<br />\nrepresentative of Johns Hopkins. To quote Coach Comfort, \"The<br />\nNationals are a part of swimming\" and \"Not to beg, it sure would be<br />\nnice if the University would give us a hand\". Mr. Bilgrave's quick<br />\nresponse (to the tune of two hundred dollars) is commendable.<br />\nThe swimming team had an excellent season this year and,<br />\nwith Coach Comfort, in the next few years will be within the top ten<br />\nCollege Division teams. In the one year under his tutelage, the team<br />\nhas made tremendous strides and, in future seasons, our<br />\nparticipation in the Nationals will become the rule rather than the<br />\nexception. It would be a shame if this archaic practice of not<br />\nsupporting post-season competition is allowed to continue. The<br />\nUniversity claims it gives a damn about the student. Well, here is one<br />\narea where it is letting us down. It's about time for a change!<br />\nWe wish good luck to the swimmers and hope that this<br />\nproblem can be avoided in future seasons and in other sports.<br />\nHowever, we would like to take space to publicly thank Mr. Bilgrave<br />\nand all others who've made the trip to Springfield possible.<br /><br />\nFoes Could Provide Strenuous<br />\nOpposition for Blue Jay Ten<br />\nRutgers, with the loss of their outstanding<br />\ngoalie, figures to be a little weaker than last year;<br />\nbut always boasts a large corps of Long Isla\"<br />\nrecruits.<br />\nNavy, at first glance, is also a bit weaker<br />\nthan last year having graduated All-American<br />\nMac Ogilvie in the goal and All-American Cad,<br />\nTamulevitch on defense. However, scouting<br />\nreports indicate that Ogilvie's replacement;<br />\nSupko, will do more than an adequate job, ana<br />\nthat Coach Bilderback has come up with a new<br />\nsuper-stud who did not play last season to make<br />\neveryone forget Tamulevitch. Of course, Nag<br />\nalways has a hoarde of strong midfielders.<br />\nPerhaps they are a bit weaker, but they will be<br />\nno push-overs.<br />\nNemesis.:<br />\nFinally, there is the old Hopkins<br />\nof th.elt<br />\nfour<br />\nMaryland. With the graduation of<br />\nfirst six middies and Steve Lavaut, coupled with<br /><br />\nBy JASON KRAVITT<br /><br />\nAt first glance, the Varsity Lacrosse<br />\nschedule appears extremely favorable to<br />\nthe Blue Jays. The previous 11 game<br />\nschedule has been cut to 10 with 7 games<br />\nat home. A closer examination, though,<br />\nreveals quite a different story. To begin<br />\nwith, 3 out of the last 5 games are away<br />\nincluding the two most difficult: Army<br />\nand Maryland.<br />\nIn addition, Hopkins' opponents are<br />\ngreatly improved over former years. Yale, after a<br />\npoor start which included a 20-1 rout at the<br />\nhands of the Blue Jays, finished fast amassing a<br />\n7-4-1 record and winning 5 and tying one of their<br />\nlast 6 games. In addition, this year's squad<br />\nfeatures soph goalie Mike Stanton who will be<br />\nquite a change from last year's net-minder.<br />\nMt. Washington, has lost some strength on<br />\nattack and defense which will feature Rob<br />\nMcCool, Steve Levy and Ed Shaivist. However, as<br />\nusual, the Mounts will feature tremendous<br />\nstrength and depth at midfield and in the goal.<br />\nAs always, this game will depend on the mental<br />\nattitude of both teams.<br />\nRegan Returns for Washington<br />\nWashington College again features<br />\nall-American Phil Regan on attack and will be<br />\nseeking to duplicate last year's feat as Small<br />\nCollege National Champion.<br />\nIn an informal Coaches Poll, many picked<br />\nan improved Princeton team as No. 3 in the<br />\nnation. The Tigers will boast much heralded<br />\nsophomore Pete Johnson at attack, of Garden<br />\ncity fame, and most of the defense which held<br />\nMaryland to a 6-6 tie in double over-time last<br />\nyear.<br />\nVirginia will perhaps be the most improved<br />\nof all because of the fact that they will be<br />\nplaying their freshmen \u2014 four of whom Coach<br />\nScott feels will start. Their defense, featuring<br />\nall-American Pete Coy, will return intact and<br />\nwith a revamped attack, the Cavaliers should give<br />\nthe Blue Jays quite a tense battle.<br />\nMysterious Loyola<br />\nNot too much is known about Loyola, but<br />\nthe Charles Street Massacre should continue to<br />\nbe as bloody as in recent years.<br />\nBeginning the killer stretch of the season, is<br />\nthe Army game. Coach Bud Adams has put<br />\ntogether one of the potentially most potent<br />\nattacks of the country with All-American Peter<br />\nCramblitt and a new Soph sensation, Cafero, out<br />\nof Long Island, who set all sorts of scoring<br />\nrecords for the Plebes last year. Their midfields,<br />\nwhich last year were rather young, return almost<br />\nintact and bolstered by one of the best<br />\nsophomore crew in years. Army's only losses<br />\nwere a few defensemen which a service Academy<br />\ncan always replace. To predict the outcome of<br />\nthis game, one must remember that it is being<br />\nplayed at West Point.<br /><br />\n(Continued on Page 15)<br /><br />\n\u2018ti<br /><br />\nLACROSSE Scrimmages Prepare Jay Stickers<br />\ntomorrow's home opener against Yale.<br /><br />\nfor<br /><br />\n1'1).<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\n....<br /><br />\n1,<br /><br />\n1,\u2022<br />\n.<br />\n.1<br />\n,<br />\n11 - 11 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022,..-a<br />\n.....<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAR. 21, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 15<br /><br />\nB.I.A.

Beta's<br />\nSurf Riley scored 9 points. His last basket tied the game<br />\nup 36-36 at the end of regulation play. This basket came<br />\nwith 15 seconds left to go and was made after a<br />\ncontroversial call by referee Charlie Coker. Big Jim<br />\nJohnson had 14 points for TEP. Down 7-1 after the first<br />\nfew opening minutes of play, TEP had to scramble to tie<br />\nthe game 17-17 at halftime. In the second half, Beta<br />\nfound itself down most of the time (5 points at the<br />\nmost), but the team came back strong in the overtime<br />\nPeriod as the bucket by Beta's Tom Kaleita put the game<br />\nout of reach.<br />\nOswald Wins Squash<br />\nDelta Phi's Bill Oswald beat ATO's Kit Battenfeld<br />\nto win the fraternity squash tournament.

However,a core of good<br />\nballplayers did return, around whom<br />\nBarrette hopes to build a team that will<br />\ngive a respectable showing.<br /><br />\nax Season Prospects Uncertain<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 14)<br />\nDoug Carter's injury, the Terrapins<br />\nare hurting on attack. Bart Effinger, and<br />\nlast year's starter, Graham, will team up<br />\nWith converted All-American<br />\ndefenseman, Hugh Mallon in this<br />\ndepartment. But in Coach Howard's<br />\nfavor is the nation's best goalie Norm<br />\nVanDershuyt, and a vicious defense that<br />\nallowed Mt. Washington only four goals<br />\nin a recent scrimmage. Of course,<br /><br />\nMaryland will have plenty of midfield<br />\ndepth.<br />\nThis year, then, there will be a lot<br />\nmore close games and a general<br />\nequalization of talent with the<br />\ntraditional powers playing much closer<br />\nto their opposition. It will be quite a feat<br />\nfor the Blue Jays to duplicate last year's<br />\nNational title. But then, they have done<br />\nit before and who is to say that they<br />\ncannot do it again?<br /><br />\nPitching Strong<br />\nThe strongest part of the squad is<br />\nits pitching, with four proven reliable<br />\nperformers. Senior Hal Thorne, and<br />\njunior Rich Thielke, both right-handers<br />\nare both returning lettermen and are<br />\ncapable of consistently getting the job<br />\ndone. Nelson Cover, a junior who had to<br />\nsit out last season because of his transfer<br />\nstudent status, and Glen Deuchler, a left<br />\nhanded sophomore add depth.<br />\nBacking these four up will be<br />\nDave Reeves, and George Inana, right<br />\nhanders, and southpaw Stan Liebowitz.<br />\nAll of these men are inexperienced and<br />\nmust be tested before they can be relied<br />\nupon.<br />\nThe most doubtful position on<br />\nthe team is catcher. Barrette is currently<br />\ncounting on Co-captain Chip Breschkin<br /><br />\nto do the job. Last year Breschkin was<br />\nan all-Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\noutfielder. He was, however, a catcher<br />\nin his freshman year.<br />\nAnother outfielder, Bob Slacum,<br />\nwill be used as a backup man for<br />\nBreschkin. Slacum was also all-M.A.C.<br />\nlast year, and batted .471 in league<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nThe first base position is also<br />\ndoubtful. It will be filled by senior Mike<br />\nAvery, who was out all of last season<br />\nwith a broken ankle. He had an<br />\noperation earlier in the year and<br />\nprobably won't be at full speed for at<br />\nleast a while.<br />\nThe second base and shortstop<br />\npositions are pretty well set. Bruce<br />\nBouchard, a sophomore described as<br />\nexcellent by the coach,and who batted<br />\n.300 for the frosh last year, will be at<br />\nsecond. Co-captain, Jim Zuger, a<br />\nreturning letterman who batted .286<br />\nlast year,will play shortstop.<br />\nAt third base Dennis O'Neill and<br />\nTed Drake, both juniors will be<br />\ncompeting for the starting slot.

Hayakawa, acting president of strife-torn<br />\nSan Francisco State College, relayed Mr. Nixon's views<br />\nMonday after conferring with the President. Nixon said<br />\nthat he would come out with a detailed statement on<br />\nstudent aid later this week.<br />\nAbout 800,000 college and university students<br />\nreceive federal grants and another 750,000 have bank<br />\nloans: guaranteed by the government. One government<br />\nofficial said that federal money is given directly to the<br />\ncolleges, which in turn decide how to apportion it<br />\namong the students and when to withdraw it.<br />\nUnder two recent laws, the colleges must cut off<br />\naid to students convicted of disorders. They would be<br />\nbanned from receiving aid for two years, even if they<br />\nwere transferred to another college.<br />\nAn amendment to the Higher Education Act of<br />\n1968 requires that money be cut off if a college, after a<br />\nhearing, finds that the student was convicted on<br />\ndisorderly conduct. An amendment to the current<br />\nappropriations act for the Departments of Labor and<br />\nIIEW makes the same requirement, without a hearing.<br />\nSuspension or expulsion immediately curtails<br />\nfederal aid to a student, although he is free to reapply if<br />\nhe transfers to another college.<br /><br />\nLynn Joins Staff<br />\nDr. Kenneth S. Lynn, a professor at Harvard for<br />\nover 15 years and for one year at Federal City College,<br />\nwill join the Hopkins history department next<br />\nSeptember according to acting chairman of history, Dr.<br />\nJack P. Greene.<br />\nDr. Lynn will teach both a 300 and 600 lovel<br />\ncourse on American intellectual history next semester.<br />\nIle received his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. at Harvard and has<br />\ntaught there since the early 1950's. The middle aged<br />\nprofessor lectured at 1 larvard both as a professor of<br />\nAmerican literature and as the chairman of the<br />\ndepartment of American Studies.<br />\nLast year Dr. Lynn agreed to leave Harvard to<br />\nteach at the newly-formed Federal City College in<br />\nWashington D.C. Dr. Greene said the conditions at<br />\nFederal College were very poor.<br />\nDr. Lynn has written The American Dream of<br />\nSin Tess and Mark Twain and Southwestern Humor,<br />\namong other hooks.<br /><br />\nRoamin' the World<br />\n(A P)--Me in hers of the House spent nearly<br />\nthree-quarters of a million dollars roaming the world last<br />\nyear including one House member whose last fling<br />\nbefore leaving office cost taxpayers $8,453.<br />\nThat tab was run up by Porter Hardy, Jr., (D.,<br />\nVa.), who toured 19 countries in two trips three months<br />\nafter he said he wouldn't seek re-election. Hardy toured<br />\nEurope, South America and the South Pacific as<br />\nchairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on<br />\nnational defense posture.<br />\nThe trip, during which the subcommittee spent<br />\n$61,178, yielded one report critical of a Defense<br />\nDepartment analysis and another critical of several U.S.<br />\ncommitments. Altogether during 1968, more than 150<br />\nmembers of the House spent about $700,000 on travel<br />\nto all parts of the world on \"official business.\" The<br />\nlargest expenditures were reported by the Foreign<br />\nAffairs Committee totaling $142,492 last year.<br />\nHardy's Armed Services Committee spent<br />\n$123,918 on more than half a dozen separate trips by its<br />\nmembers to just about every free nation in the world.<br />\nCommenting on this Committee's travels, a<br />\nsubcommittee aide emphasized, \"Believe me, the trips<br />\nwere much more than just inspection visits of our<br />\nmilitary bases abroad. They were intended to assess our<br />\nmilitary committments aboard and our capacity to meet<br />\nthose commit t men ts.\"<br /><br />\n'Radical Dialogue'<br />\nTwo radical \"social relations\" courses at Harvard<br />\nhas met great popularity among the students and has<br />\ncaused profound unease among many Harvard<br />\nprofessors.<br />\nAfter great success last semester,\"Social Relations<br />\n149: Radical Perspective in Social Change\" this half has<br />\nenrolled 633 students and is divided into 45 sections.<br />\nThe course eschews the lecture system, contains few<br /><br />\n\\Farmer Attacks<br /><br />\nOld Liberalism<br /><br />\nsection leaders eligible for Harvard teaching<br />\nappointments and even contains a nonstudent who is a<br />\n(Continued from Page 2)<br />\nstaff member of SDS.<br />\nno comment on the bill by the Administration.
