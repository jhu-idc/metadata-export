After studying for years<br />\nat various universities in the United<br />\nStates and England, Dr. A. Compton<br />\nbecame head of the physics department at Washington University in<br />\n1920. Since 1923 he has been professor of physics at the University<br />\nof Chicago.<br />\nIn addition to being the first to describe polarization and total reflection in X-rays, he is the discoverer<br />\nof the \"Compton Effect.\" The latter effect\u2014which observed fall in<br />\nthe frequency of X-rays when scattered by collision\u2014is important in<br />\nphysics because it indicates that the<br />\nrays are corpuscular and not a form<br />\nof wave motion.<br />\nCosmic Ray Authority<br />\nDr. Compton has extended the modern corpuscular theory of radiation<br />\nto cosmic rays. In order to obtain a<br />\nfund of reliable data, he has made<br />\nseveral expeditions over the world<br />\nto study the geographical distribution of cosmic rays, and especially<br />\nthe effect of the earth's magnetic field<br />\nupon their intensity.

This principle, Dr.<br />\nCompton believes, is scientific evidence of the existence of \"free will\"<br />\nin the universe as opposed to the<br />\nclassical scientific view of metaphysics which declares that all events and<br />\nhuman actions are predetermined by<br />\nthe inevitable operation of natural<br />\nlaws.<br />\n<br />\nLibrary Receives<br />\nFour Hundred Books<br />\n<br />\nTait' Beta Pi Taps<br />\nSix Outstandkng<br />\nMen As Members<br />\nEngineering Frat Initiates<br />\nDavis, Brown, Tampico,<br />\nFoard, Fax, Curtis<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins branch of Tau<br />\nBeta Pi, the national honorary engineering society, held its formal iitiation on Thursday, April 15.
