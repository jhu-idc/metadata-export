Professor<br />\nRitchey, of the Mount Wilson Observatory, delivered an illustrated<br />\nlecture on one of the most engrossing of subjects\u2014the photography of<br />\nheavenly bodies. The entire lectnre<br />\nwas presented in such a simple/and<br />\nlucid Manner that the explanations<br />\nof the complicated reflecting telescope and its parts presented no difficulties to the scientifically untrained mind. In order to show the<br />\ngreat effectiveness of the Mount<br />\nWilson sixty-inch reflector, Professor Ritchey showed several series<br />\nof pictures of the same nebulx<br />\ntaken by different telescopes. The<br />\nphotographs taken by the Mount<br />\nWilson telescope were so distinct<br />\nand detailed, and presented such a<br />\ncontrast to the photographs taken<br />\nby other instruments, that the au-<br />\n<br />\nOn Thursday evening. March 16,<br />\nin M cCov Hall, was held the first<br />\nMaryland intercollegiate contest in<br />\noratory. The speakers contesting<br />\nfor prizes were Messrs. John F.<br />\nCrosby, of Georgetown University,<br />\nwho spoke on \"The United States<br />\nand the World Peace Movement\";<br />\nL. Claude Bailey, of St. John's College, who spoke on -America and<br />\nPeace\"; Lingurn Burkhead Bobbitt,<br />\nof Johns Hopkins University, who<br />\nspoke on \"Patriotism and Peace,\"<br />\nand Calvin Taylor Ryan, of Washington College, whose subject was<br />\n\"The Practical Applications of Arbitration.\" The representative of<br />\nLoyola College, Mr. Charles Sebastian Lerch, whose intentions were to<br />\nspeak upon \"The Possibilities of<br />\nPeace,- was unable to appear by reason of the death of the rector of the<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThe judges, who were Dr. Eugene A. Noble, Judge John J. Dobler, and Rev. Edwin B. Niver,<br />\nawarded the prizes as, follows:<br />\nFirst prize, $7;, to Mr. Bobbitt, and<br />\nthe second prize,$50, to Mr. Crosby.<br />\nAfter the Hopkins Glee Club had<br />\nrendered the humorous \"Mynheer<br />\nVan Dunk\" and Dean Griffin had<br />\nmade a few introductory remarks,<br />\nDr. French, who was the presiding<br />\nofficer, announced the rules of the<br />\ncontest. Dr. French also made<br />\nknown that the decoration, music,<br />\narrangements, etc., were under the<br />\nsupervision of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nArbitration Society, and that the<br />\nprizes were offered through the Intercollegiate Peace Association by<br />\nthe Maryland Peace Society.<br />\nMr. Crosby, of Georgetown, was<br />\nfirst introduced, a speaker of imposing appearance, a pleasing personality and with a powerful, yet mellow,<br />\nvoice.<br />\nThe next speaker was Mr. Bailey,<br />\nof St. John's College. His delivery<br />\nwas far inferior to that of his predecessor on the stage, being much too<br />\nrapid. But the subject matter of the<br />\nspeech was commendable.<br />\nThe next speaker introduced was<br />\nour own Mr. Bobbitt, whose address<br />\nwas fully up to the standard expected by his friends. His speech<br />\nwas to the effect that a country<br />\nshould fear war, not as a result of<br />\nyellow journalism, but as a result of<br />\npatriotism. A nation ought to fight<br />\nonly when it is attacked after having<br />\noffered peaceful settlements. Then,<br />\nand then only, is patriotism consistent with war.<br />\n<br />\nDr. William H. Welch has received one more distinction to bear<br />\nout the title of \"the foremost exponent of medicine ,in the United<br />\nStates,\" conferred by the leading<br />\nmedical men of this nation. Emperor William of Germany has honored him with the decoration of the<br />\nKoeniglicher Kronen-Orden Zweiter Klasse. There are four distinct<br />\nclasses in this order.<br />\nThe decoration comes from Emperor William as King of Prussia,<br />\nand it is the emblem of a Prussian<br />\norder. Of gold and white, the decoration is in the form of a Maltese<br />\ncross, suspended from a blue ribbon. Upon one side is the crown of<br />\nPrussia in gold and on the other is<br />\ninscribed \"Wilhelm, Konig.\"<br />\nDr. Welch received the decoration Friday through the German<br />\nAmbassador at Washington, who<br />\nsent it to the German Consul in this<br />\ncity, by whom it was presented in<br />\nperson. Later a document will be<br />\nsent to Dr. Welch from the German<br />\nGovernment, which will formally<br />\nconfer the distinction of the order.<br />\n\"Of course, I would not find occasion to wear the decoration in this<br />\ncountry,\" said Dr. Welch. \"The<br />\nonly circumstances in all probability<br />\nunder which I would pin it on<br />\nwould be at some formal function<br />\nin Europe.\"<br />\nThe decoration must be returned<br />\nto the Emperor upon the recipient's<br />\ndeath. That is always the condition upon which they are conferred.<br />\nIt is not unreasonable, for were it<br />\notherwise the decoratitins would<br />\nsoon be scattered broadcast.<br />\nWhile Dr. Welch deprecates his<br />\nworthiness as a recipient of so signal a recognition by the German<br />\nEmperor, his many friends in Baltimore and the United States, who<br />\nare aware of the great work he has<br />\naccomplished for medicine, particularly in the science of pathology,<br />\nwill by no means be at a loss to account for the tribute to his eminence.<br />\n<br />\nThe cold wave of last week prevented the lacrosse team from starting outdoor practice at Homewood.<br />\nWith the first signs of\u2022a let-up of<br />\nthe cold weather, however, the<br />\nsquad will begin outdoor work..<br />\nThe men on the sick list are getting along fairly and will soon be<br />\nback at their old places.

SHOREY<br />\n<br />\n(THE NEWS-LETTER is always glad to<br />\npublish letters of reasonable length<br />\nupon topics of interest in the University<br />\ncircles.

It is<br />\nquite my opinion that something<br />\nshould be done in the matter of provision for medical attendance to<br />\nstudents. This is especially true in<br />\nthe case of an institution like the<br />\nHopkins, where, to the student,<br />\nevery cent counts. With the facilities at hand, and the relations with<br />\nthe medical faculties, there seems<br />\nto me no reason which may preclude<br />\nthe possibility of providing for this<br />\nneed. In view of the contemplated<br />\nmove to Homewood and the change<br />\nto the dormitory system, such a<br />\nneed will be felt all the more<br />\nstrongly.<br />\nFor a small additional sum from<br />\neach student, which would secure a<br />\nhealth insurance to everyone, a sufficient sum could be raised to provide<br />\nproper attendance.<br />\nIn my own college such a system<br />\nwas employed. The college owned<br />\na handsomely equipped infirmary,<br />\nand for the sum of two or three<br />\ndollars from each student, paid at<br />\nthe first of each academic year,<br />\nevery medical attendance was furnished without further charge, save<br />\nfor medicines or special nurses. A<br />\nregular trained nurse, employed by<br />\nthe college, was in attendance.<br />\nTo me it seems that it Would be a<br />\npleasure for each student to pay<br />\nsuch a fee, thus feeling sure of<br />\nhimself in case of financial stringency, which is usually the case<br />\nwith students, needless to say.<br />\nThis question should be put up<br />\nsquarely to the proper authorities<br />\nand be dealt with so as to secure<br />\nthe greatest possible benefit for the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nYour agitation of so important a<br />\nmatter is quite commendable.

Professor Shorey spoke upon \"Athens Fin<br />\ndu Si\u00e8cle\"\u2014Athens at that decadent, yet still brilliant period of<br />\nher history, which followed upon<br />\nher defeat by Sparta and preceded<br />\nher degradation at the hands of<br />\nMacedon. The lecturer by his insight, wit, and appreciation made<br />\nthe period live again before his audience : its social life, its politics,<br />\nand its literature; its care-free license, its gilded corruption, and its<br />\ntinseled ostentation. He did not<br />\ndignify his theme with a pompous<br />\nand analytical dissertation, but<br />\nadapted the tone of his paper to its<br />\nsubject; and by his apt use of modern slang and modern allusions<br />\ncharmed his hearers into the belief<br />\nthat they had supped with Lycoris,<br />\nbartered with Demosthenes, and applauded a play of Menander.<br />\nDr. Shorey is one of the most<br />\ncultured and brilliant of modern<br />\nclassical scholars. His \"literary\"<br />\nedition of Horace's Odes, as he calls<br />\nit, is already well known to some of<br />\nus.

Professor<br />\nRitchey, of the Mount Wilson Observatory, delivered an illustrated<br />\nlecture on one of the most engrossing of subjects\u2014the photography of<br />\nheavenly bodies. The entire lectnre<br />\nwas presented in such a simple/and<br />\nlucid Manner that the explanations<br />\nof the complicated reflecting telescope and its parts presented no difficulties to the scientifically untrained mind. In order to show the<br />\ngreat effectiveness of the Mount<br />\nWilson sixty-inch reflector, Professor Ritchey showed several series<br />\nof pictures of the same nebulx<br />\ntaken by different telescopes. The<br />\nphotographs taken by the Mount<br />\nWilson telescope were so distinct<br />\nand detailed, and presented such a<br />\ncontrast to the photographs taken<br />\nby other instruments, that the au-<br /><br />\nOn Thursday evening. March 16,<br />\nin M cCov Hall, was held the first<br />\nMaryland intercollegiate contest in<br />\noratory. The speakers contesting<br />\nfor prizes were Messrs. John F.<br />\nCrosby, of Georgetown University,<br />\nwho spoke on \"The United States<br />\nand the World Peace Movement\";<br />\nL. Claude Bailey, of St. John's College, who spoke on -America and<br />\nPeace\"; Lingurn Burkhead Bobbitt,<br />\nof Johns Hopkins University, who<br />\nspoke on \"Patriotism and Peace,\"<br />\nand Calvin Taylor Ryan, of Washington College, whose subject was<br />\n\"The Practical Applications of Arbitration.\" The representative of<br />\nLoyola College, Mr. Charles Sebastian Lerch, whose intentions were to<br />\nspeak upon \"The Possibilities of<br />\nPeace,- was unable to appear by reason of the death of the rector of the<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThe judges, who were Dr. Eugene A. Noble, Judge John J. Dobler, and Rev. Edwin B. Niver,<br />\nawarded the prizes as, follows:<br />\nFirst prize, $7;, to Mr. Bobbitt, and<br />\nthe second prize,$50, to Mr. Crosby.<br />\nAfter the Hopkins Glee Club had<br />\nrendered the humorous \"Mynheer<br />\nVan Dunk\" and Dean Griffin had<br />\nmade a few introductory remarks,<br />\nDr. French, who was the presiding<br />\nofficer, announced the rules of the<br />\ncontest. Dr. French also made<br />\nknown that the decoration, music,<br />\narrangements, etc., were under the<br />\nsupervision of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nArbitration Society, and that the<br />\nprizes were offered through the Intercollegiate Peace Association by<br />\nthe Maryland Peace Society.<br />\nMr. Crosby, of Georgetown, was<br />\nfirst introduced, a speaker of imposing appearance, a pleasing personality and with a powerful, yet mellow,<br />\nvoice.<br />\nThe next speaker was Mr. Bailey,<br />\nof St. John's College. His delivery<br />\nwas far inferior to that of his predecessor on the stage, being much too<br />\nrapid. But the subject matter of the<br />\nspeech was commendable.<br />\nThe next speaker introduced was<br />\nour own Mr. Bobbitt, whose address<br />\nwas fully up to the standard expected by his friends. His speech<br />\nwas to the effect that a country<br />\nshould fear war, not as a result of<br />\nyellow journalism, but as a result of<br />\npatriotism. A nation ought to fight<br />\nonly when it is attacked after having<br />\noffered peaceful settlements. Then,<br />\nand then only, is patriotism consistent with war.<br /><br />\nDr. William H. Welch has received one more distinction to bear<br />\nout the title of \"the foremost exponent of medicine ,in the United<br />\nStates,\" conferred by the leading<br />\nmedical men of this nation. Emperor William of Germany has honored him with the decoration of the<br />\nKoeniglicher Kronen-Orden Zweiter Klasse. There are four distinct<br />\nclasses in this order.<br />\nThe decoration comes from Emperor William as King of Prussia,<br />\nand it is the emblem of a Prussian<br />\norder. Of gold and white, the decoration is in the form of a Maltese<br />\ncross, suspended from a blue ribbon. Upon one side is the crown of<br />\nPrussia in gold and on the other is<br />\ninscribed \"Wilhelm, Konig.\"<br />\nDr. Welch received the decoration Friday through the German<br />\nAmbassador at Washington, who<br />\nsent it to the German Consul in this<br />\ncity, by whom it was presented in<br />\nperson. Later a document will be<br />\nsent to Dr. Welch from the German<br />\nGovernment, which will formally<br />\nconfer the distinction of the order.<br />\n\"Of course, I would not find occasion to wear the decoration in this<br />\ncountry,\" said Dr. Welch. \"The<br />\nonly circumstances in all probability<br />\nunder which I would pin it on<br />\nwould be at some formal function<br />\nin Europe.\"<br />\nThe decoration must be returned<br />\nto the Emperor upon the recipient's<br />\ndeath. That is always the condition upon which they are conferred.<br />\nIt is not unreasonable, for were it<br />\notherwise the decoratitins would<br />\nsoon be scattered broadcast.<br />\nWhile Dr. Welch deprecates his<br />\nworthiness as a recipient of so signal a recognition by the German<br />\nEmperor, his many friends in Baltimore and the United States, who<br />\nare aware of the great work he has<br />\naccomplished for medicine, particularly in the science of pathology,<br />\nwill by no means be at a loss to account for the tribute to his eminence.<br /><br />\nThe cold wave of last week prevented the lacrosse team from starting outdoor practice at Homewood.<br />\nWith the first signs of\u2022a let-up of<br />\nthe cold weather, however, the<br />\nsquad will begin outdoor work..<br />\nThe men on the sick list are getting along fairly and will soon be<br />\nback at their old places.

It is<br />\nquite my opinion that something<br />\nshould be done in the matter of provision for medical attendance to<br />\nstudents. This is especially true in<br />\nthe case of an institution like the<br />\nHopkins, where, to the student,<br />\nevery cent counts. With the facilities at hand, and the relations with<br />\nthe medical faculties, there seems<br />\nto me no reason which may preclude<br />\nthe possibility of providing for this<br />\nneed. In view of the contemplated<br />\nmove to Homewood and the change<br />\nto the dormitory system, such a<br />\nneed will be felt all the more<br />\nstrongly.<br />\nFor a small additional sum from<br />\neach student, which would secure a<br />\nhealth insurance to everyone, a sufficient sum could be raised to provide<br />\nproper attendance.<br />\nIn my own college such a system<br />\nwas employed. The college owned<br />\na handsomely equipped infirmary,<br />\nand for the sum of two or three<br />\ndollars from each student, paid at<br />\nthe first of each academic year,<br />\nevery medical attendance was furnished without further charge, save<br />\nfor medicines or special nurses. A<br />\nregular trained nurse, employed by<br />\nthe college, was in attendance.<br />\nTo me it seems that it Would be a<br />\npleasure for each student to pay<br />\nsuch a fee, thus feeling sure of<br />\nhimself in case of financial stringency, which is usually the case<br />\nwith students, needless to say.<br />\nThis question should be put up<br />\nsquarely to the proper authorities<br />\nand be dealt with so as to secure<br />\nthe greatest possible benefit for the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nYour agitation of so important a<br />\nmatter is quite commendable.

Professor Shorey spoke upon \"Athens Fin<br />\ndu Si\u00e8cle\"\u2014Athens at that decadent, yet still brilliant period of<br />\nher history, which followed upon<br />\nher defeat by Sparta and preceded<br />\nher degradation at the hands of<br />\nMacedon. The lecturer by his insight, wit, and appreciation made<br />\nthe period live again before his audience : its social life, its politics,<br />\nand its literature; its care-free license, its gilded corruption, and its<br />\ntinseled ostentation. He did not<br />\ndignify his theme with a pompous<br />\nand analytical dissertation, but<br />\nadapted the tone of his paper to its<br />\nsubject; and by his apt use of modern slang and modern allusions<br />\ncharmed his hearers into the belief<br />\nthat they had supped with Lycoris,<br />\nbartered with Demosthenes, and applauded a play of Menander.<br />\nDr. Shorey is one of the most<br />\ncultured and brilliant of modern<br />\nclassical scholars. His \"literary\"<br />\nedition of Horace's Odes, as he calls<br />\nit, is already well known to some of<br />\nus.
