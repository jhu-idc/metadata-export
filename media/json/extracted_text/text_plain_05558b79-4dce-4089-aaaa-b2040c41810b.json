Medley Team Conquers Carnegie.<br />\n<br />\nIn the final event of the evening<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins mile relay quartet proved that its performance a<br />\nweek previous at New York was<br />\nno flash in the pan, when it triumphed over Virginia and Washing and Lee for the South Atlantic<br />\ntitle. This race was one of the features of the evening, and it came as<br />\na pleasing ending to a program of<br />\nstellar track events. The Black<br />\nand Blue team was composed of<br />\nThomson, Norwood; Skinner and<br />\nEdwards, all of whom had been<br />\nkept out of other competition and<br />\nprimed for their event.<br />\nCaptain Joe Thompson started<br />\nfor Hopkins and finished even with<br />\nhis Virginia man. By fine passing<br />\nof the baton, Randy Norwood, running second, managed to grab the<br />\nlead on the turn, which he increased to over ten feet before<br />\nhanding the stick to Bob Skinner.<br />\nBob made a name for himself when<br />\nhe walked away from the Virginia<br />\nman. This he did, not in one sprint,<br />\nbut by consistent and evenly<br />\ntimed running. Once he had safely<br />\npassed the baton to Ridge Edwards;<br />\nthe Hopkins rooters relaxed their<br />\ntensioned fists, for they knew that<br />\nonly by a miracle could the latter<br />\nbe headed. Ridge maintained his<br />\nteam's lead all the way and if<br />\npushed he could probably have lowered the time considerably. Virginia had second all the way, and<br />\nthe Generals took third.<br />\nThe Hopkins medley relay team<br />\nalso came in for its share of the<br />\nglory when it trounced Carnegie<br />\nTech by a wide margin.

When he passed the stick<br />\nto Sommerville it was with a lead<br />\nlarge enough to foretell the ultimate victory. \"Sommy\" ran a pretty race and when he gave \"Verne\"<br />\nBooth a lead of about sixty yards<br />\nit was just a question of how decisive the victory would be. The<br />\nlanky Hopkins miler took things<br />\neasy and held the same lead<br />\nthroughout.<br />\nAnother feature of the meet,<br />\nfrom a Hopkins standpoint, was<br />\nthe half-mile interfraternity relay.<br />\nThis race had stirred up much<br />\nfriendly rivalry between the different societies and it was a thriller<br />\nthroughout. First one and then another team flashed into the lead.<br />\nSpills were numerous and excitement high at all stages. Marchetti,<br />\nanchor man for Kappa Sigma,<br />\nfinally breezed down the last<br />\nstraightaway with a comfortable<br />\nlead over Middleton, of Alpha Delta Phi.

With such stars as Le Gendre, Connolly, Kinally, Davis, Shallott, Marsters, Tupar, Brooks,<br />\nGaffey, Brewster, Vokman, Fenney and others, the Washingtonians<br />\npresented an array of talent that<br />\nwas not approached by any other<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThe shot which started the first<br />\nheat of the 100-yard dash was fired<br />\nat 7:30, and from that time until<br />\n12:20 the track was kept warm almost continuously by the pounding<br />\no; hundreds of feet. After many<br />\npreliminaries and semi-finals, this<br />\nevent was finally won by Le Gendre, of Georgetown. The 100-yard<br />\nlow hurdle race was captured by<br />\nHile, of Penn State, in a close finish with Parent, of the Meadowbrook Club. Georgetown again<br />\ncame to the fore in the 220-yard<br />\ndash, when Gaffey broke the tape<br />\nahead of two Virginia men.<br />\nIn the two middle-distance events<br />\nGeorgetown and Virginia divided<br />\nthe honors. Bohannon captured<br />\nthe 440 for the latter, while Brewster led in the 880. Georgetown<br />\nadded to her total by grabbing second in both events. Each of these<br />\nraces started off with a large number of entries and the competition<br />\nwas exceedingly keen.<br />\nOne of the features of the evening was the open mile, in which<br />\nConnolly, the intercollegiate champion, led Booth, the Hopkins ace,<br />\nto the tape by several feet, in 4 min.<br />\n30 1-5 secs. Considering the fact<br />\nthat each of these men had previously run a mile on their respective medley relay team, this time<br />\nv.Tas very fast.<br />\nThe medley relays were the features of the meet, and all were<br />\nclosely contested. In the first medley of the evening, the Hopkins<br />\nteam trounced the representatives<br />\nof Carnegie Tech. In similar races,<br />\nLafayette downed the University<br />\nof Pittsburgh, Georgetown romped<br />\naway from Fordham and Penn<br />\nState pleased the spectators by<br />\ntrouncing Navy. In the latter event<br />\nShields was called upon to put<br />\nforth his best in order to maintain<br />\nhis lead over Curtis, of Navy, who<br />\nended with a strong sprint.<br />\nOne of the closest, fastest and<br />\nmost exciting races of the evening<br />\nwas the<br />\n.mile relay between Princeton and M. I. T. Tech led for the<br />\nfirst half of the race, but the third<br />\nPrinceton man made a wonderful<br />\nsprint and gave the last man a good<br />\nlead. However, the M. I. T. runner started out to catch his man<br />\nand at the finish he was only a step<br />\nbehind Taylor, of Princeton. The<br />\ntime was 3 min. 28 1-5 secs., the<br />\nfastest time for the mile made during the evening.<br />\n<br />\nContinued on col. 1<br />\n<br />\nContinued on page 2, col. 4<br />\n<br />\n\fT H E JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, FEBRUARY 28, 1922<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns<br />\n<br />\nHopkins News-Letter<br />\nFOUNDED 1897.<br />\n<br />\nPopular Geology Professor, in Special<br />\nArticle, Gives Excellent Advice<br />\nto Underclassmen.<br />\n$2.50<br />\n<br />\nSubscription<br />\n<br />\nEntered as second-class matter December 3, 1909, at the Postoffice at<br />\nBaltimore, Md., under Act of Congress, November 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished semi-weekly from October to June by the students of Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be addressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY; all articles and other communications<br />\nshould be sent to the MANAGING EDITOR.<br />\nHomewood 100<br />\n<br />\nTelephone<br />\nEditor-in-Chief:<br />\nH.

The bottle<br />\nunasan<br />\nis<br />\nunmolested,<br />\nwhen<br />\nand,<br />\ntip,<br />\nto<br />\ntip<br />\nto eight inches from<br />\nsuming and care-free creature.<br />\nBut when a larger fish with evil intent approaches, the bottlefish immediately assumes new dimensions. With incredible suddenness, he begins to swell and does not cease until he has attained<br />\nan unbelievable size. He is not, only too big to pass through the<br />\njaws of the larger fish, but he is now the aggressor and is able to<br />\nterrorize his neighbors by reason of his length and magnitude.<br />\nThere are many among us who possess this same quality; the<br />\nbottle-fish is only demonstrating one of the most common practices<br />\nin everyday life-the art of bluffing. Bluff is sometimes condemned<br />\nas being deceitful; but, like the bottle-fish, there are many who<br />\nwould be \"devoured\" if it were not for a display of strength or<br />\nability beyond their actual powers.<br />\n\"Bluff,\" as one of our contemporaries notes, is \"but a show of<br />\nassumed self-confidence, a camouflaging of weakness. Bluffing and<br />\ncounter-bluffing put spice and pep into the game of life; commerce,<br />\npolitics, war, literature, love and countless other phases of life have<br />\ntheir little games of bluff.\"<br />\n\"Bluffing\" is a good game if played squarely-,without harm to<br />\nthe \"bluffee.\" It is an admirable and sometimes necessary attribute.<br />\nBut the individual who goes through college and through life depending upon the art alone, is certainly a misguided person. Bluff<br />\nis sure to fail some time; there will surely.come an occasion when<br />\nthe larger fish will detect the subterfuge of the bottle-fish and will<br />\ndevour him. Wouldn't it be better to fit ourselves to become a<br />\n\"larger fish,\" thus escaping an ever-present peril and ridding oneself<br />\nof the necessity of \"swelling up.\"<br />\n<br />\nBy C. K. SwARTz, P.H. D.<br />\nThe years spent in college are<br />\namong the most important in a<br />\nman's life. They are frought with<br />\ninfluences which mold our future<br />\nand lay the foundations of character. To use them wisely is a<br />\nworthy ambition in any man. Many<br />\na man has arrived at his senior<br />\nyear with the sudden discovery<br />\nthat the years have been illy spent,<br />\nthe opportunities have flown and<br />\nare irrecoverable. It is, hence, a<br />\nmatter of great moment to answer<br />\nthe question aright, how can I make<br />\nthe most of my college course? A<br />\nfew comments only can be ventured<br />\nconcerning the more essential conditions of success.<br />\nFirst to be emphasized is the<br />\nchoice of associates and friends.<br />\nFriendships formed in college not<br />\nonly are among the most delightful<br />\nexperiences of our college life, but<br />\nthey affect us as few other influences do in these years. The man<br />\nwho chooses men of high caliber<br />\nand superior character as his<br />\nfriends can scarcely go astray,<br />\nwhile those who make their associates men of light weight and indifferent qualities cannot confidently hope for true success. To a degree that few of us suspect, we are<br />\ninfluenced<br />\nby the judgment,<br />\nthought and character of those<br />\nabout us. The effect of our friends<br />\nupon us is as subtle as that of the<br />\nair and not less potent. Indeed, our<br />\neducation springs in no small degree from intercourse with our fellow students, not simply from the<br />\nbooks we read and the men who<br />\nteach us. Where our friends are<br />\nsuperior men our minds are quickened by contact with them as diamond polishes diamond. Men of<br />\nhigh worth inspire us to a larger<br />\nand truer appreciation of the value<br />\nof the finer things of life and stimulate us to attain them, while inferior men sap us of aspirations<br />\nfor these things. Good friends<br />\nbring many rewards.<br />\nSound scholarship is the second<br />\nfactor to be emphasized. The modern student is surrounded by a host<br />\nof things that tend to absorb his<br />\ntime and withdraw him from the<br />\nsursuit of the main thing in college life-sound scholarship. Many<br />\nstudent activities appeal to him for<br />\nsupport. These may be, and doubtless are, in general, of great value<br />\nto the student, tending to develop<br />\nqualities that will stand him in good<br />\nstead in after life. Nevertheless,<br />\nthey cease to be useful if they stand<br />\nin the way of the acquisition of that<br />\nfor which he should enter college.<br />\nOf little use are the appendages<br />\nwith the central thing left out. The<br />\npurpose of the college is the development of sound scholarship.<br />\nUpon it all the other features of<br />\nthe college are built. Executive<br />\nability, social gifts, sound health,<br />\nall are to be secured without the<br />\ncollege. Scholarship is developed<br />\nwithin it. The first purpose of the<br />\ncollege is to bring a young man<br />\ninto contact with the finest thoughts<br />\nof the finest minds of the ages, to<br />\nimpart to him an appreciation of<br />\ntrue values, and to cultivate the<br />\npower of independent thought. It<br />\nis the possession of these qualities<br />\nthat make a college man so valuable<br />\na member of the community.

Medley Team Conquers Carnegie.<br /><br />\nIn the final event of the evening<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins mile relay quartet proved that its performance a<br />\nweek previous at New York was<br />\nno flash in the pan, when it triumphed over Virginia and Washing and Lee for the South Atlantic<br />\ntitle. This race was one of the features of the evening, and it came as<br />\na pleasing ending to a program of<br />\nstellar track events. The Black<br />\nand Blue team was composed of<br />\nThomson, Norwood; Skinner and<br />\nEdwards, all of whom had been<br />\nkept out of other competition and<br />\nprimed for their event.<br />\nCaptain Joe Thompson started<br />\nfor Hopkins and finished even with<br />\nhis Virginia man. By fine passing<br />\nof the baton, Randy Norwood, running second, managed to grab the<br />\nlead on the turn, which he increased to over ten feet before<br />\nhanding the stick to Bob Skinner.<br />\nBob made a name for himself when<br />\nhe walked away from the Virginia<br />\nman. This he did, not in one sprint,<br />\nbut by consistent and evenly<br />\ntimed running. Once he had safely<br />\npassed the baton to Ridge Edwards;<br />\nthe Hopkins rooters relaxed their<br />\ntensioned fists, for they knew that<br />\nonly by a miracle could the latter<br />\nbe headed. Ridge maintained his<br />\nteam's lead all the way and if<br />\npushed he could probably have lowered the time considerably. Virginia had second all the way, and<br />\nthe Generals took third.<br />\nThe Hopkins medley relay team<br />\nalso came in for its share of the<br />\nglory when it trounced Carnegie<br />\nTech by a wide margin. Clarke<br />\nran first for Hopkins and opened<br />\nup a lead that was never increased<br />\n/<br />\n8 mile grind.<br />\nthroughout the 17<br />\nDorcus ran the quarter and proved<br />\nhimself to be another star at that<br />\ndistance. When he passed the stick<br />\nto Sommerville it was with a lead<br />\nlarge enough to foretell the ultimate victory. \"Sommy\" ran a pretty race and when he gave \"Verne\"<br />\nBooth a lead of about sixty yards<br />\nit was just a question of how decisive the victory would be. The<br />\nlanky Hopkins miler took things<br />\neasy and held the same lead<br />\nthroughout.<br />\nAnother feature of the meet,<br />\nfrom a Hopkins standpoint, was<br />\nthe half-mile interfraternity relay.<br />\nThis race had stirred up much<br />\nfriendly rivalry between the different societies and it was a thriller<br />\nthroughout. First one and then another team flashed into the lead.<br />\nSpills were numerous and excitement high at all stages. Marchetti,<br />\nanchor man for Kappa Sigma,<br />\nfinally breezed down the last<br />\nstraightaway with a comfortable<br />\nlead over Middleton, of Alpha Delta Phi. Kappa Alpha finished third.<br />\nIn the open events only a few<br />\nof the Hopkins stars were entered,<br />\nmost of them being saved for spe-<br /><br />\nneither quantity nor quality, easily<br />\ncaptured the team trophy for open<br />\nevents with a score three times as<br />\ngreat as its nearest competitor, Virginia. With such stars as Le Gendre, Connolly, Kinally, Davis, Shallott, Marsters, Tupar, Brooks,<br />\nGaffey, Brewster, Vokman, Fenney and others, the Washingtonians<br />\npresented an array of talent that<br />\nwas not approached by any other<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThe shot which started the first<br />\nheat of the 100-yard dash was fired<br />\nat 7:30, and from that time until<br />\n12:20 the track was kept warm almost continuously by the pounding<br />\no; hundreds of feet. After many<br />\npreliminaries and semi-finals, this<br />\nevent was finally won by Le Gendre, of Georgetown. The 100-yard<br />\nlow hurdle race was captured by<br />\nHile, of Penn State, in a close finish with Parent, of the Meadowbrook Club. Georgetown again<br />\ncame to the fore in the 220-yard<br />\ndash, when Gaffey broke the tape<br />\nahead of two Virginia men.<br />\nIn the two middle-distance events<br />\nGeorgetown and Virginia divided<br />\nthe honors. Bohannon captured<br />\nthe 440 for the latter, while Brewster led in the 880. Georgetown<br />\nadded to her total by grabbing second in both events. Each of these<br />\nraces started off with a large number of entries and the competition<br />\nwas exceedingly keen.<br />\nOne of the features of the evening was the open mile, in which<br />\nConnolly, the intercollegiate champion, led Booth, the Hopkins ace,<br />\nto the tape by several feet, in 4 min.<br />\n30 1-5 secs. Considering the fact<br />\nthat each of these men had previously run a mile on their respective medley relay team, this time<br />\nv.Tas very fast.<br />\nThe medley relays were the features of the meet, and all were<br />\nclosely contested. In the first medley of the evening, the Hopkins<br />\nteam trounced the representatives<br />\nof Carnegie Tech. In similar races,<br />\nLafayette downed the University<br />\nof Pittsburgh, Georgetown romped<br />\naway from Fordham and Penn<br />\nState pleased the spectators by<br />\ntrouncing Navy. In the latter event<br />\nShields was called upon to put<br />\nforth his best in order to maintain<br />\nhis lead over Curtis, of Navy, who<br />\nended with a strong sprint.<br />\nOne of the closest, fastest and<br />\nmost exciting races of the evening<br />\nwas the<br />\n.mile relay between Princeton and M. I. T. Tech led for the<br />\nfirst half of the race, but the third<br />\nPrinceton man made a wonderful<br />\nsprint and gave the last man a good<br />\nlead. However, the M. I. T. runner started out to catch his man<br />\nand at the finish he was only a step<br />\nbehind Taylor, of Princeton. The<br />\ntime was 3 min. 28 1-5 secs., the<br />\nfastest time for the mile made during the evening.<br /><br />\nContinued on col. 1<br /><br />\nContinued on page 2, col. 4<br /><br />\nT H E JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, FEBRUARY 28, 1922<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nThe Johns<br /><br />\nHopkins News-Letter<br />\nFOUNDED 1897.<br /><br />\nPopular Geology Professor, in Special<br />\nArticle, Gives Excellent Advice<br />\nto Underclassmen.<br />\n$2.50<br /><br />\nSubscription<br /><br />\nEntered as second-class matter December 3, 1909, at the Postoffice at<br />\nBaltimore, Md., under Act of Congress, November 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished semi-weekly from October to June by the students of Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be addressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY; all articles and other communications<br />\nshould be sent to the MANAGING EDITOR.<br />\nHomewood 100<br /><br />\nTelephone<br />\nEditor-in-Chief:<br />\nH.

The bottle<br />\nunasan<br />\nis<br />\nunmolested,<br />\nwhen<br />\nand,<br />\ntip,<br />\nto<br />\ntip<br />\nto eight inches from<br />\nsuming and care-free creature.<br />\nBut when a larger fish with evil intent approaches, the bottlefish immediately assumes new dimensions. With incredible suddenness, he begins to swell and does not cease until he has attained<br />\nan unbelievable size. He is not, only too big to pass through the<br />\njaws of the larger fish, but he is now the aggressor and is able to<br />\nterrorize his neighbors by reason of his length and magnitude.<br />\nThere are many among us who possess this same quality; the<br />\nbottle-fish is only demonstrating one of the most common practices<br />\nin everyday life-the art of bluffing. Bluff is sometimes condemned<br />\nas being deceitful; but, like the bottle-fish, there are many who<br />\nwould be \"devoured\" if it were not for a display of strength or<br />\nability beyond their actual powers.<br />\n\"Bluff,\" as one of our contemporaries notes, is \"but a show of<br />\nassumed self-confidence, a camouflaging of weakness. Bluffing and<br />\ncounter-bluffing put spice and pep into the game of life; commerce,<br />\npolitics, war, literature, love and countless other phases of life have<br />\ntheir little games of bluff.\"<br />\n\"Bluffing\" is a good game if played squarely-,without harm to<br />\nthe \"bluffee.\" It is an admirable and sometimes necessary attribute.<br />\nBut the individual who goes through college and through life depending upon the art alone, is certainly a misguided person. Bluff<br />\nis sure to fail some time; there will surely.come an occasion when<br />\nthe larger fish will detect the subterfuge of the bottle-fish and will<br />\ndevour him. Wouldn't it be better to fit ourselves to become a<br />\n\"larger fish,\" thus escaping an ever-present peril and ridding oneself<br />\nof the necessity of \"swelling up.\"<br /><br />\nBy C. K. SwARTz, P.H. D.<br />\nThe years spent in college are<br />\namong the most important in a<br />\nman's life. They are frought with<br />\ninfluences which mold our future<br />\nand lay the foundations of character. To use them wisely is a<br />\nworthy ambition in any man. Many<br />\na man has arrived at his senior<br />\nyear with the sudden discovery<br />\nthat the years have been illy spent,<br />\nthe opportunities have flown and<br />\nare irrecoverable. It is, hence, a<br />\nmatter of great moment to answer<br />\nthe question aright, how can I make<br />\nthe most of my college course? A<br />\nfew comments only can be ventured<br />\nconcerning the more essential conditions of success.<br />\nFirst to be emphasized is the<br />\nchoice of associates and friends.<br />\nFriendships formed in college not<br />\nonly are among the most delightful<br />\nexperiences of our college life, but<br />\nthey affect us as few other influences do in these years. The man<br />\nwho chooses men of high caliber<br />\nand superior character as his<br />\nfriends can scarcely go astray,<br />\nwhile those who make their associates men of light weight and indifferent qualities cannot confidently hope for true success. To a degree that few of us suspect, we are<br />\ninfluenced<br />\nby the judgment,<br />\nthought and character of those<br />\nabout us. The effect of our friends<br />\nupon us is as subtle as that of the<br />\nair and not less potent. Indeed, our<br />\neducation springs in no small degree from intercourse with our fellow students, not simply from the<br />\nbooks we read and the men who<br />\nteach us. Where our friends are<br />\nsuperior men our minds are quickened by contact with them as diamond polishes diamond. Men of<br />\nhigh worth inspire us to a larger<br />\nand truer appreciation of the value<br />\nof the finer things of life and stimulate us to attain them, while inferior men sap us of aspirations<br />\nfor these things. Good friends<br />\nbring many rewards.<br />\nSound scholarship is the second<br />\nfactor to be emphasized. The modern student is surrounded by a host<br />\nof things that tend to absorb his<br />\ntime and withdraw him from the<br />\nsursuit of the main thing in college life-sound scholarship. Many<br />\nstudent activities appeal to him for<br />\nsupport. These may be, and doubtless are, in general, of great value<br />\nto the student, tending to develop<br />\nqualities that will stand him in good<br />\nstead in after life. Nevertheless,<br />\nthey cease to be useful if they stand<br />\nin the way of the acquisition of that<br />\nfor which he should enter college.<br />\nOf little use are the appendages<br />\nwith the central thing left out. The<br />\npurpose of the college is the development of sound scholarship.<br />\nUpon it all the other features of<br />\nthe college are built. Executive<br />\nability, social gifts, sound health,<br />\nall are to be secured without the<br />\ncollege. Scholarship is developed<br />\nwithin it. The first purpose of the<br />\ncollege is to bring a young man<br />\ninto contact with the finest thoughts<br />\nof the finest minds of the ages, to<br />\nimpart to him an appreciation of<br />\ntrue values, and to cultivate the<br />\npower of independent thought. It<br />\nis the possession of these qualities<br />\nthat make a college man so valuable<br />\na member of the community.
