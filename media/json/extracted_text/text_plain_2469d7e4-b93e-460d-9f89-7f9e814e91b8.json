It will be the duty of<br />\nthese men to see that no item of<br />\ninterest concerning any of the three<br />\nabove sports will escape publication<br />\nin Baltimore sport sheets. Under<br />\nthis new system it is hoped that due<br />\nand sufficient notice will be given<br />\nto all Hopkins contests and prospects as soon as any information is<br />\ngleaned.
