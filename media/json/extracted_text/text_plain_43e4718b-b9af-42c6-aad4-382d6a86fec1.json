The reason for the rejection, as explained in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter, was based on a constitutional requirement that<br />\ncalls for the participation of a majority of the student body in an<br />\nelection to make the election valid.<br />\nUnder the proposed constitution, this requirement would be<br />\nchanged. Instead a plurality would elect a man to office and there<br />\nwould be no requirement as to the number of persons participating<br />\nin the election. In proposing this change, the Council has recognized<br />\nthe fact that it is seldom more than a third to a half of the under-<br />\n<br />\nof poisonous plants.<br />\n<br />\n-0-<br />\n<br />\nOne thing which never ceases<br />\nto astound your correspondent is<br />\nthe touching credulity of the average American, especially when it<br />\ncomes to their favorite comic strip<br />\ncharacters. They tell the story<br />\nabout the hundreds of floral<br />\nwreaths sent to cartoonist Milton<br />\nCaniff when his heroine Raven<br />\nSherman f.ell out of a truck on<br />\nher conk and kicked off. There<br />\nwas the man who offered to give<br />\nFlattop a decent burial. The payoff was the little panel inserted.<br />\nby Ham Fisher is his Joe Palooka<br />\ncomic strip which expressed the<br />\ncartoonist's gratitude for all the<br />\noffers of help from city, county,<br />\nstate officials, boy scouts, college<br />\nand high school students. They<br />\n<br />\ngraduates exercise their voting privilege. In order to retain some<br />\ndegree of representative self-government, the Council has recommended the change.<br />\nAmong other changes recommended by the Council in the<br />\nproposed constitution is one which will enlarge the powers of the<br />\nCouncil. Under Article V, Powers, the following articles have<br />\nbeen offered for consideration<br />\n,\"Sec 4 The Student Council shall have power to speak for<br />\nthe student body in dealing with parties outside the University.<br />\noil questions of concern to the entire student body. The Student<br />\nCouncil shall refer questions that may be the outcome of such<br />\ndealings to the student body for discussion by vote if necessary.<br />\n\"Sec 5 The Student Council shall have the power to select<br />\nrepresentatives to any conference or convention that is of concern\"<br />\nto the entire student body.\"<br />\nThese two sections simply say that the Council has complete<br />\nauthority in dealing with parties outside the University. The Council may decide whether to recognize these parties, and once recognized will have the power to select the representatives to the particular conference or convention. Section 4 states that the Council<br />\nmay refer questions to the student body concerning their dealings<br />\nwith parties outside the University.<br />\nAt first glance, these new sections seemed to give,the Council<br />\nunlimited powers in handling questions that arise in connection<br />\nwith parties outside of the University. However, a later section<br />\nof the constitution provides for student initiative on such questions,<br />\npermitting a group of students to present a petition to the council<br />\nrequesting a referendum on such questions.<br />\nThis power of initiative balances the Council's powers in regard to dealings with parties outside of the University. If, for any<br />\n,reason, a large &lough group of students feels that a Council decision does not reflect true student opinion, the power of initiative<br />\nwill enable the- students to bring the Council decision to a test.<br />\nThe proposed constitution, as it now stands, is not perfect.<br />\nFew, if any, constitutions are perfect. The proposed constitution,<br />\nwithout doubt, is far superior to the present constitution. The proposed constitution will give the Student Council a workable document.

The reason for the rejection, as explained in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter, was based on a constitutional requirement that<br />\ncalls for the participation of a majority of the student body in an<br />\nelection to make the election valid.<br />\nUnder the proposed constitution, this requirement would be<br />\nchanged. Instead a plurality would elect a man to office and there<br />\nwould be no requirement as to the number of persons participating<br />\nin the election. In proposing this change, the Council has recognized<br />\nthe fact that it is seldom more than a third to a half of the under-<br /><br />\nof poisonous plants.<br /><br />\n-0-<br /><br />\nOne thing which never ceases<br />\nto astound your correspondent is<br />\nthe touching credulity of the average American, especially when it<br />\ncomes to their favorite comic strip<br />\ncharacters. They tell the story<br />\nabout the hundreds of floral<br />\nwreaths sent to cartoonist Milton<br />\nCaniff when his heroine Raven<br />\nSherman f.ell out of a truck on<br />\nher conk and kicked off. There<br />\nwas the man who offered to give<br />\nFlattop a decent burial. The payoff was the little panel inserted.<br />\nby Ham Fisher is his Joe Palooka<br />\ncomic strip which expressed the<br />\ncartoonist's gratitude for all the<br />\noffers of help from city, county,<br />\nstate officials, boy scouts, college<br />\nand high school students. They<br /><br />\ngraduates exercise their voting privilege. In order to retain some<br />\ndegree of representative self-government, the Council has recommended the change.<br />\nAmong other changes recommended by the Council in the<br />\nproposed constitution is one which will enlarge the powers of the<br />\nCouncil. Under Article V, Powers, the following articles have<br />\nbeen offered for consideration<br />\n,\"Sec 4 The Student Council shall have power to speak for<br />\nthe student body in dealing with parties outside the University.<br />\noil questions of concern to the entire student body. The Student<br />\nCouncil shall refer questions that may be the outcome of such<br />\ndealings to the student body for discussion by vote if necessary.<br />\n\"Sec 5 The Student Council shall have the power to select<br />\nrepresentatives to any conference or convention that is of concern\"<br />\nto the entire student body.\"<br />\nThese two sections simply say that the Council has complete<br />\nauthority in dealing with parties outside the University. The Council may decide whether to recognize these parties, and once recognized will have the power to select the representatives to the particular conference or convention. Section 4 states that the Council<br />\nmay refer questions to the student body concerning their dealings<br />\nwith parties outside the University.<br />\nAt first glance, these new sections seemed to give,the Council<br />\nunlimited powers in handling questions that arise in connection<br />\nwith parties outside of the University. However, a later section<br />\nof the constitution provides for student initiative on such questions,<br />\npermitting a group of students to present a petition to the council<br />\nrequesting a referendum on such questions.<br />\nThis power of initiative balances the Council's powers in regard to dealings with parties outside of the University. If, for any<br />\n,reason, a large &amp;lough group of students feels that a Council decision does not reflect true student opinion, the power of initiative<br />\nwill enable the- students to bring the Council decision to a test.<br />\nThe proposed constitution, as it now stands, is not perfect.<br />\nFew, if any, constitutions are perfect. The proposed constitution,<br />\nwithout doubt, is far superior to the present constitution. The proposed constitution will give the Student Council a workable document. It deserves the sanction of the students in next week's elec-<br /><br />\nmendous jobs being offered by an<br />\nAlaskan fish- cannery.
