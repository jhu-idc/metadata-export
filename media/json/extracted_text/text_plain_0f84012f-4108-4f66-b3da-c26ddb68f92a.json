After the<br />\n6 to 3 score in football, and the<br />\n4 to 4 score in lacrosse, the Black<br />\nand Blue felt they owed the Navy<br />\na beating. It was hard work, but<br />\nthey gave it.<br />\nBetween Pieper and Vinson on<br />\nthe mound, the game was a fight<br />\nfrom start to finish. It would 1)0<br />\nhard to say where the laurels kAA.<br />\nBesides pitching steadily, \"Smoke\"<br />\nhad the situation in control at all<br />\nstages of the game, only giving<br />\none pass, while the sailor lad allowed two.<br />\nWilliams' shoe-string catch in the<br />\nfirst saved two runs. Porter played<br />\na truly exceptional game. Webster was pretty busy, making some<br />\nlong running catches. \"Hub\" Rice<br />\nthrew out Vinson trying to steal<br />\nsecond, and caught the same player<br />\nagain off first base.'<br />\nIn the tenth, with two men on<br />\nthe sacks, when it looked like the<br />\nNavy was sure to score, Webster<br />\ncaught a line-drive, saving the<br />\nBlack and Blue.<br />\nBut it was in the eleventh inning<br />\nthat joy came to the J. H. U. With<br />\ntwo men out, the 'Varsity got a<br />\nrunner home that made them the<br />\nvictors.

Another championship banner has been added to<br />\nour Trophy Room collection.<br />\nWith two experienced veterans<br />\nout of the game, \"Buts\" Sutton<br />\nand \"Tommy\" Troxell, the Black<br />\nand Blue rooters were a little dubious as to what the outcome would<br />\nbe. But while the Indians were<br />\nbeing worsted by the track team<br />\nat Homewood, and \"Smoke\" Pieper<br />\nand his teammates were defeating<br />\nthe crack Navy nine, the Black and<br />\nBlue twelve gave the wood to the<br />\nGarnet.<br />\nThe 'Varsity starting off with its<br />\nusual rush scored two goals in<br />\nquick succession; Knipp and Beatty<br />\nturned the trick.<br />\nThis proved unfortunate, for<br />\nthings looked too easy and the team<br />\nslackened up, with the result that<br />\nSwarthmore quickly tied the score<br />\nand then drew one point in the lead.<br />\nBut even then the Black and Blue<br />\ndid not steady down, although<br />\nBeatty again evened up by netting<br />\na long shot. Before the half was<br />\nover, however, the Garnet made a<br />\nfourth tally, again taking the lead.<br />\nThe second half showed a remarkable improvement on the part<br />\nof Hopkins. The defense tightened<br />\nup, the mid-field followed the ball<br />\nharder, the attack was here, there,<br />\nand everywhere, shooting hard<br />\nfrom all angles.<br />\nThen things roughened up. Two<br />\nHopkins men were seen and penalized, one Swarthmore player being similarly treated.

Webster was pretty busy, making some<br />\nlong running catches. \"Hub\" Rice<br />\nthrew out Vinson trying to steal<br />\nsecond, and caught the same player<br />\nagain off first base.'<br />\nIn the tenth, with two men on<br />\nthe sacks, when it looked like the<br />\nNavy was sure to score, Webster<br />\ncaught a line-drive, saving the<br />\nBlack and Blue.<br />\nBut it was in the eleventh inning<br />\nthat joy came to the J.

Another championship banner has been added to<br />\nour Trophy Room collection.<br />\nWith two experienced veterans<br />\nout of the game, \"Buts\" Sutton<br />\nand \"Tommy\" Troxell, the Black<br />\nand Blue rooters were a little dubious as to what the outcome would<br />\nbe. But while the Indians were<br />\nbeing worsted by the track team<br />\nat Homewood, and \"Smoke\" Pieper<br />\nand his teammates were defeating<br />\nthe crack Navy nine, the Black and<br />\nBlue twelve gave the wood to the<br />\nGarnet.<br />\nThe 'Varsity starting off with its<br />\nusual rush scored two goals in<br />\nquick succession; Knipp and Beatty<br />\nturned the trick.<br />\nThis proved unfortunate, for<br />\nthings looked too easy and the team<br />\nslackened up, with the result that<br />\nSwarthmore quickly tied the score<br />\nand then drew one point in the lead.<br />\nBut even then the Black and Blue<br />\ndid not steady down, although<br />\nBeatty again evened up by netting<br />\na long shot. Before the half was<br />\nover, however, the Garnet made a<br />\nfourth tally, again taking the lead.<br />\nThe second half showed a remarkable improvement on the part<br />\nof Hopkins. The defense tightened<br />\nup, the mid-field followed the ball<br />\nharder, the attack was here, there,<br />\nand everywhere, shooting hard<br />\nfrom all angles.<br />\nThen things roughened up. Two<br />\nHopkins men were seen and penalized, one Swarthmore player being similarly treated.

Perhaps this is true because a criticism of so well established an institution as the Phi Beta<br />\nhappa might seem to be prompted<br />\nby those whom we call \"sore-heads\"<br />\nand \"sour grapes.\" There is,.however, wisdom in the objections which<br />\nmight be advocated against the<br />\nmethod of recruiting this notable<br />\nfraternity. That no other method<br />\n.of election has been adjudged practicable seems to alter the case but<br />\nslightly.<br />\nThe absurdity of over-classification attributed t9 Matthew Arnold,<br />\nwho insisted on grading mathematically the victims of his literary<br />\ncriticism, can be applied to these<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa elections. Psychologists, it is true, may feel that<br />\nthere is a relation between the power of the intellect and the actual<br />\nweight of the brain. Nevertheless,<br />\nit is to be hoped that our wits will<br />\nrefrain from proposing the chemical balance as a Phi Beta Kappa<br />\nqualification. It seems almcst as<br />\nridiculous, furthermore, to consider<br />\nthe tens which the \"bluffers- and the<br />\n\"bootlickers\" pull as indices to the<br />\nhighest order of mental development.
