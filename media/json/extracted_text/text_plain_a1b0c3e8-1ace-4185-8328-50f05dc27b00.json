In some writings Lattimore defended American policy in Asia, in other places he disagreed with it. Certainly<br />\nquestions of opinion, especially scholarly opinion, should not be<br />\nconfused with \"following the Communist line,\" or \"promoting'<br />\nit.<br />\nWithout indulging in speculation, it,would be impossible for<br />\na jury to determine whether Lattimore wrote with the conscious<br />\nobject of \"promoting communism\" or merely arrived at, after<br />\nindependent thought, conclusions the same as those also held<br />\nby the communists.<br />\nAs Judge Youngdahl has already stated: \"It is fundamental<br />\nthat a jury should not be asked to determine an issue that may be<br />\ndecided only by conjecture.\"<br />\nJudge Youngdahl has upheld the Bill of Rights.

Fortunately the Hopkins academic community has come to realize that<br />\nrace and religion are irrelevant<br />\ncriteria for determining eligibilities for membership. I therefore<br />\nshould like to have seen the NewsLetter, recognizing the principles<br />\nit creates, the liberal university,<br />\ngo on to assert that no organization on campus should have constitutional provisions that compel<br />\ndiscrimination.

In some writings Lattimore defended American policy in Asia, in other places he disagreed with it. Certainly<br />\nquestions of opinion, especially scholarly opinion, should not be<br />\nconfused with \"following the Communist line,\" or \"promoting'<br />\nit.<br />\nWithout indulging in speculation, it,would be impossible for<br />\na jury to determine whether Lattimore wrote with the conscious<br />\nobject of \"promoting communism\" or merely arrived at, after<br />\nindependent thought, conclusions the same as those also held<br />\nby the communists.<br />\nAs Judge Youngdahl has already stated: \"It is fundamental<br />\nthat a jury should not be asked to determine an issue that may be<br />\ndecided only by conjecture.\"<br />\nJudge Youngdahl has upheld the Bill of Rights. But this<br />\ndoes not imply that the Justice Department will stop trying to<br />\ninfringe on the most sacred right of the American people, the<br />\nfreedom to think, and to have MI upkutult.<br /><br />\nfrom the principles that have<br />\nshaped its development. Fortunately the Hopkins academic community has come to realize that<br />\nrace and religion are irrelevant<br />\ncriteria for determining eligibilities for membership. I therefore<br />\nshould like to have seen the NewsLetter, recognizing the principles<br />\nit creates, the liberal university,<br />\ngo on to assert that no organization on campus should have constitutional provisions that compel<br />\ndiscrimination. I realize full well<br />\nthat a fraternity as a voluntary<br />\nassociation of people who for<br />\nwhatever reason they think relevant, choose to include in the association one person or another.<br />\nBut surely a provision that, for<br />\nexample, no Negro however fine<br />\nhis personal qualities, could conceivably be worthy of membership<br />\nin this association is one that is<br />\ncompletely incompatible with the<br />\nliberal principles which values<br />\nmen for what they contribute to<br />\nthe enrichment of the university<br />\nand not for their possessing or<br />\nfailure to possess the right religion, race, or place of birth.<br /><br />\nFIGHT YOUR OWN FIGHTS, do<br />\nnot appeal to the higher authoriAs of now, who would make the<br />\nties.
