We're told that Mark Twain's first book was not The Gilded Age, but at this point,<br />\nwe care not. 28 Across - Morticia Addams's cousin was \"Itt\", not \"It.\" Then the grand snafu: 31 Across<br />\nshould have read, \"An ostrich-like animal.\" In any case, we accepted either \"Gnu\" or \"Emu:<br />\n\"even<br />\nthough \"Guggenheim\" has an \"m\" at the<br />\nend. (Hold on a sec while I catch my<br />\nbreath.) 14 Down should be, \"The prin1<br />\nM 6<br />\nM<br />\ncess\" (not the \"princes\") \"felt it.\" 8<br />\nNo two ways about it, we screwed up<br />\n(<br />\n9N<br />\n11/1 I<br />\nroyally.

During the<br />\neight rounds of debating, each<br />\nscored by three judges, the<br />\nHopkins team won on 16 of 24<br />\nballots, but could post no better<br />\nthan a three-win, five-loss record<br />\nbecause of losses on split decisions.<br />\nThe team did not obtain the<br />\nmoney it needed to go until<br />\nalmost the last minute. On<br />\nApril 18, the Student Council<br />\nvoted to allocate $845 from the<br />\nStudent Activities Commission<br />\n(SAC) contingency fund, to be<br />\ndeducted from the Debate<br />\nCouncil's 1979-80 budget. Debate Council President Len<br />\nLucchi said, \"I think it's unfair<br />\nthat it has to come out of<br />\nnext year's budget, since we'll<br />\nhave freshmen coming in to<br />\ndebate and since we have a<br />\nteam, Carl Glitzenstein and Jim<br />\nDeSimone, which looks very<br />\npromising for next year. They<br />\njust missed qualifying for the<br />\nnationals this time around.\"<br />\nLucchi noted that Hopkins<br />\nhad been one of only three<br />\nschools in the country to send<br />\ntwo teams to the nationals in<br />\neach of the previous two years.<br />\nAt that time the debators<br />\nreceived funding for the trip in a<br />\npackage assembled by then-Dean<br />\nof Students Jakie Hall from<br />\nvarious University sources outside the SAC, including the<br />\nalumni, but this year such<br />\nfunding was unavailable.<br />\nLucchi complained that<br />\nthe uncertainty of their funding<br />\nhindered the team. \"Not knowing they'd go until the last<br />\nminute hurt Sue's and Greg's<br />\npreparation,\" he said.<br />\nAccording to Lucchi and<br />\n<br />\nHughes, the debaters first<br />\napproached the SAC executive<br />\nboard for money, but the SAC<br />\nsent them around to various<br />\ndeans, none of whom gave them<br />\nhelp. Finally, on April 16 they<br />\nwent to the Office of the President, and presidential assistant<br />\nRonald Sapp told them the<br />\nPresident's office would be unable to supply funding. Sapp<br />\nthen telephoned Jakie Hall,<br />\ninformed the debaters that Hall<br />\nalso could not help, and sent<br />\nthem back to the SAC. However, Hall insisted he had told<br />\nSapp to send the debaters to<br />\nhim. \"Nobody ever talked to me<br />\nin person about this,\" Hall said.<br />\nLucchi said the Debate<br />\nCouncil would work with Director of Student Activities Chris<br />\nBY HARRY LERNER<br />\nColombo and SC President<br />\nGeorge Connolly during the,<br />\nEleven<br />\nHopkins undersummer to get non-SAC funding graduates have been<br />\nadmitted to<br />\nfor next year and beyond. the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nReferring to the April 18 SC School this year, including<br />\nseven<br />\nmeeting at which the chess team who were admitted into the<br />\n2-5<br />\nreceived SAC money after com- accelerated B.A.-M.D.<br />\nprogram.<br />\nparing its competitive record \"Needless to say, I am unhappy<br />\nwith that of the debaters, Lucchi about the number they've<br />\nacadded,\"We have no dispute with cepted this year, but it wasn't<br />\nthe chess team.<br />\nAfter the for any venal reason,\" said John<br />\nmeeting, we got together with Gryder, chairman of the Health<br />\nthem and agreed that since we're Professions<br />\nRecommendation<br />\nreally in the same boat, we'll Committee.<br />\nwork together with them.\"<br />\nThat number \"is lower this<br />\nColombo and Connolly year than last year,\" said Dr.<br />\nboth feel that the funding for Gryder. \"That's balanced by its<br />\ncompetitive organizations should being higher at Harvard.\" He<br />\nnot come from the SAC because added that Hopkins graduates<br />\nthey benefit few students. still constitute about 15% of the<br />\nColombo said, \"I will suggest<br />\nthat the Debate Council be an<br />\nindependent student activity<br />\nfunded outside the SAC, but<br />\nthey must be more selective in<br />\nchoosing which tournaments to<br />\ngo to.

He<br />\nstressed that universities do not<br />\nsee it as their duty to help<br />\nmankind, and they remain isolated from the main stream of<br />\nlife. He said that in an urban<br />\nschool similar to Hopkins where<br />\nhe once taught, the university<br />\n\u2022 members had no contact whatsoever with the blacks and the<br />\npoor in the city around them:<br />\n\"Students were afraid to go<br />\ndowntown.\"<br />\nHe said that<br />\nstudents are no longer interested<br />\nin travelling and meeting peoples<br />\nthey are ordinarily isolated<br />\nfrom.<br />\n<br />\nOfficials Say Medical School<br />\nAccepts Hopkins Undergrads<br />\nfreshman class at the Medical<br />\nSchool, more than from any<br />\nother college.<br />\n\"We have said openly there<br />\nare no quotas,\" said David<br />\nKnox, Assistant Dean for Admissions at the Medical School.<br />\n\"It's not a percentage game.

He<br />\nnoted that application folders<br />\nwere processed so quickly this<br />\nyear that many Hopkins undergraduates had their first interview at Hopkins Medical School<br />\nand therefore suffered from<br />\nnervousness.<br />\nGryder also suggested that<br />\nHopkins undergraduates do not<br />\nmake a good impression on the<br />\nadmissions staff because they<br />\nfeel they already know all about<br />\nthe Medical School.

The Conservative victory in the British<br />\nparliamentary elections has carried Margaret Thatcher as<br />\nEngland's first-ever woman Prime Minister.<br />\nMrs. Thatcher's election marks the first time ever in<br />\nthe history of Western republican government that a<br />\nwoman has ever become a democratically-elected head of<br />\nstate without being a relative of some departed leader, as<br />\nin the cases of Indira Gandhi and Isabel Peron. Although<br />\nher actual campaign success prior to yeesterday's election<br />\nwas far from impressive, and though her triumph was<br />\ncertainly due more to party platform than to personal<br />\ncharisma, her achievement is nevertheless remarkable.<br />\nLook how far women have already come, and in what<br />\na short time. Only 80 years ago, women could be considered radicals just for urging that women be given the right<br />\nto vote. And how distant we still seem from the day when<br />\na woman could become President, or even leader of<br />\na party in Congress. More than anything, Thatcher's<br />\nelection should show us how possible it is for times to<br />\nchange.<br />\nAnd times are indeed changing. Birth control technology now permits women to enjoy normal adult sex lives<br />\nwithout pregnancy or children except as they decide. And<br />\nmechanization allows them to become just as valuable<br />\neconomically as men. These represent real bonds from<br />\nwhich women have been freed, a liberation which has<br />\nfundamentally altered and improved the fundamental<br />\ncondition of life for women.<br />\nNow it is time for women to shed their political chains<br />\nas well. Men had better resign themselves to accept it. In<br />\nthe end, we'll all be better off.<br />\n<br />\nTeam Spirit<br />\nThe Student Council two weeks ago set up a policy of<br />\nrefusing to fund student activity team expenses incurred<br />\nfor competition away from Homewood. Specifically, in<br />\ndenying the Debate Council anything more than a temporary loan from the SAC contingency fund, the SC<br />\nargued that an event which takes place away from the<br />\ncampus is of no value to any students except the ones on<br />\nthe team, and so merits no expense reimbursement from<br />\nthe general student activity fund.<br />\nThe Council's reasoning is inconsistent, however. A<br />\ngroup such as, say, the Jewish Student Association funds a<br />\nconsiderable number of events such as Oneg Shabbats<br />\nduring the year which are of no value to any but the members of the organization. Still, you might argue that any<br />\nstudent is welcome to attend the Jewish services. An even<br />\nbetter example is the Outdoors Club. Only members of the<br />\nOutdoors Club can benefit from the SAC-funding allotted<br />\nto that group, which nobody has yet tried to abolish. You<br />\ncould say that any student could join the Outdoors Club,<br />\nbut then, so could any student join the Debate Club. The<br />\nCouncil clearly has established a double standard.<br />\nAnd even if expenses of groups like the Debate or<br />\nChess team are not funded through the SAC, they should<br />\nnevertheless receive enough money from general sources to<br />\ncontinue their travels.<br />\nAlthough competitive teams do not directly benefit<br />\nstudents on this campus, however, no one can deny that<br />\nthey benefit the university as a whole. By engaging in<br />\ntournaments across the country, these groups help publicize Hopkins.

However, I still cannot<br />\nhelp but wonder if the response<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nto his murder is somewhat<br />\ndehumanizing. Specifically, I am<br />\nreferring to the University's<br />\neffort to improve the safety of<br />\nits students and employees in<br />\nthe East Baltimore campus by<br />\nincreasing the number of security guards there, providing more<br />\nparking spaces closer to the<br />\nhospital, fortifying the camera<br />\nsurveillance of the hospital area,<br />\nand so forth. I do not question<br />\nwhether or not these improvements are needed; I question<br />\nwhy the University with all of its<br />\ninfluential scholars and vast<br />\nresources cannot determine why<br />\nconditions that necessitate them<br />\nexist. In other words, why does<br />\nthe University allow the perpetuation of the ghetto in East<br />\nBaltimore?<br />\nMaking the hospital a \"better fortress,\" to me, is the same<br />\nas adopting the attitude,\"As the<br />\nair quality gets worse and worse,<br />\nwe'll have to build better and<br />\nbetter gas masks.\" Wouldn't we<br />\nall be better off in the long run<br />\n<br />\nif we are able to get to the root<br />\nof the problem: stopping air<br />\npollution? Similarly, wouldn't<br />\nwe all be better off if we could<br />\ndetermine what factors cause<br />\npeople to commit crimes and<br />\neliminate them?<br />\nIt doesn't take a person<br />\nwith any great insight to realize<br />\nthat one such factor is inequality<br />\namong people (e.g., poverty vs.<br />\naffluence). Certainly there will<br />\nalways be inequality, but I am<br />\nreferring to the extreme cases.<br />\nFor example, is it necessary for<br />\none person to earn $100,000 per<br />\nyear and own a forty-foot yacht,<br />\nwhile another person can only<br />\nearn $8000 per year, and must<br />\nspend the rest of his life living<br />\nin an infested tenement? Can't<br />\neverybody benefit from the<br />\neconomic system in reasonable<br />\nmanner? Some would argue that<br />\na capitalistic economic system<br />\ndoes not allow such more or less<br />\neven distribution of wealth and<br />\nthat government intervention<br />\nwould be necessary. However, I<br />\nfeel sometimes, social pressure<br />\ncan be more effective than<br />\nlegislature. The key is to think in<br />\nterms of a generalized social<br />\nmovement involving all people,<br />\ninstead of a struggle between<br />\nclasses.<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\nHopkins<br />\ndoes little to encourage this<br />\n\"everybody can benefit\" attitude among its students. Instead,<br />\n<br />\nmost students come away believing in the doctrine of survival of<br />\nthe fittest. And why not?<br />\nCompetition for grades, competition for housing, competition<br />\nfor jobs all encourage this type<br />\nof thinking. Instead of thinking<br />\nin terms of the whole, each<br />\nstudent is taught to worry about<br />\nhis own happiness. There are<br />\nexceptions, of course, with some<br />\npeople trying to discourage this<br />\nselfish thinking, but on the<br />\nwhole, it seems the students are<br />\nencouraged to be egocentric.<br />\nCommon sense suggests that<br />\nmaking the hospital a fortress<br />\nwith higher walls only serves to<br />\nseparate the people instead of<br />\nprotecting them. In this separation the value and quality of<br />\nsome human life declines (the<br />\npoor) while that of others<br />\nincreases (the affluent). The<br />\nfinal irony of the situation is<br />\nthat Hopkins plans to build a<br />\n$1.7 million dollar athletic center downtown in the middle<br />\nof the ghetto area. Who will<br />\nbenefit from this athletic center?<br />\nWill everybody benefit? Isn't it<br />\ntime everybody benefitted?<br />\nBasil Zaharias<br />\n<br />\nDeceit<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn presenting the Conduct<br />\nCode, the conduct of the Stucont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAiPte.<br />\n<br />\nwhi\u2022up UP UM'1116solUPILIIIIC %AMCIle<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\ndent Council itself has been far<br />\nshort of exemplary.

This one exists for no other<br />\npurpose than to do you good. You would be welladvised to read it, all of it, part of it, or until you get<br />\ntired of it. You might think it's full of shit and if you do<br />\nthat's fine. But if you care what's good for you, you'll<br />\nread it first, then decide.<br />\nAll I'm really going to say are some rather simple<br />\ntruths which should be obvious to everyone, except that<br />\nthey're too often obscured by the social and psychological environment we live in. About faculty, for one<br />\nthing. Professors are no more intelligent than students.<br />\nThey simplS, hold a more exalted status within the<br />\ncontext of an academic institution. Each possesses a<br />\ngood deal more knowledge than any undergraduate<br />\nin the realm of some specialized form of inquiry. Absurdly specialized, most of them, if you think about it,<br />\nand the same is true of over 75% of the material in<br />\nmost of the courses they teach. Professors got to be<br />\nwhere they are today not through sheer reasoning<br />\nability, but by hard work and by skill in the academic<br />\ngame, the same game at which students who wind up<br />\nwith Phi Beta Kappaesque GPA's excel. The purpose of<br />\nplaying the game for many has been to avoid risking<br />\nthe uncertainties of the outside world. Not that they<br />\ndidn't do the right thing by playing--if a man has made it<br />\non to the Hopkins faculty, you have got to figure<br />\nhe is a pretty good player. But not that he is smarter<br />\nthan you are. It's just that right now, you are forced to<br />\nplay his game. Later on,things will be different.<br />\n<br />\nOur Editor is also well aware how little he knows.<br />\nYou ought to reflect for a while on just what you<br />\nare getting from your years at Johns Hopkins. The<br />\nofficially prescribed goal, of course, is a degree--some<br />\npretty writing inscribed on a fancy piece of paper. That<br />\nbit of paper does carry some weight in our society. But<br />\nnot as much as Hopkins students think it ought to. It's<br />\njust enough to get you into another rat race at a graduate school if that's the route you choose, it might not<br />\nget you out of the draft if they start that again, and it's<br />\nalmost certainly not the ticket to the job of your dreams<br />\nunless your major happens to be engineering.<br />\nMost of us are already too familiar with this state of<br />\n<br />\naffairs. It produces considerable anxiety for many<br />\namong you, especially those now nearing a departure<br />\ndate. But as we are all nearing our departure dates in<br />\none way or another, you should all consider this: It's<br />\nnot the degree you get that really counts, it's what you<br />\ncan do. In one word,COMPETENCE. If in whatever task<br />\nfalls to you over the years you can take command, get<br />\nyour shit together and get the job done, then people will<br />\nnotice you. There aren't that many people out there<br />\nwho can bring home the bacon when it counts. That's<br />\nwhy the work people do for such enterprises as the<br />\nNews-Letter is more important than the hours of toil<br />\nthey pour into academic charades which will prove<br />\nlargely irrelevant in the long run. Of course, your sense<br />\nof competence also profits from learning to get your<br />\nschoolwork done. But the more important benefit you<br />\nget from classes here is that they can possibly teach you<br />\nto think. When you are exposed in a course to a man like<br />\nOrest Ranum, or Jerry Cooper, and there are many<br />\nothers like them on our generally excellent faculty,<br />\ndon't worry about how well he thinks, but pay attention<br />\nto how well he thinks. For the key to achievement is not<br />\nthe speed or extreme accuracy of your mental functioning, but the method with which you use it. You<br />\nmust by all means think about the method you will use<br />\nin approaching the problems life confronts you with.<br />\nIf you develop such a method and a sense of competence by the time you leave here, you will have gotten<br />\nyour money's worth from Johns Hopkins, whether<br />\nyou're admitted to medical school, law school, etc., or<br />\nno. But at the same time you must realize that the<br />\npeople you meet here have the potential for playing an<br />\nenormous role in your life, and in the life of the whole<br />\ncountry for that matter, after you leave. Somebody<br />\nnow at Hopkins could well become president of IBM,or<br />\nSurgeon General, or Secretary of State. And what is he<br />\ndoing now? He's one of us, a measly little student. More<br />\nthan one of the people who surround you will become a<br />\nhero. Most everyone now at Homewood will one day<br />\nachieve a higher social status than the one he now holds,<br />\nnamely that of a lowly college student. Most, I predict, will reach much higher. The undergraduates admitted to Hopkins are good in the first place--only one of<br />\nseven applicants is taken. The people who hold high<br />\nstatus positions now will one day grow old and go away.<br />\nSomeone will be needed to replace them, and no one<br />\nwill be more competent to do so than the people who<br />\nare now university students here. If you, reader, are a<br />\nHopkins student, the chances are excellent that one day<br />\nyou will be an important person in our country. The old<br />\nsaying applies so well here: CREAM WILL RISE TO<br />\nTHE TOP.<br />\nhis does not mean the same cream that rose to the<br />\ntop in the academic pressure cooker here. First of all.<br />\nevery Hopkins student is a very capable person, else he'<br />\nwouldn't be here. A recent study showed that a top group<br />\nof performers at a prominent Eastern university were<br />\nfound a decade later to be less successful both professionally and personally -than the median group of the<br />\nsame size, that is, kids who stood right in the middle.<br />\nRemember what I said about the academic game\u2014othei<br />\nthings you learn and do are more important than the<br />\ngrades you get.<br />\nNow have you got that? I hope so, because even if<br />\nyou haven't I'm going to start you on the next chapter<br />\nanyway. It should be obvious to you by now why<br />\nyou should make as many friends as possible while you<br />\nare here, and all the time, for that matter. Not only are<br />\nthe nice people here fun to be with, but a friend you<br />\nmake now might well be able to help you out when you<br />\nneed it somewhere down the line. Boosts from your<br />\nfriends can definitely send you places, and sometimes<br />\nthey might be the chief prerequisite for getting somewhere even if you have ability. In fact, friends are<br />\nespecially important to have if you are competent,<br />\nbecause once you get your foot in the door, the rest will<br />\nbe easy for you. To all you Hopkins students out there<br />\nreading this, it should be no problem for you to comprehend that you should LIKE EVERYONE. No enemy<br />\nyou ever made is going to do anything for you except to<br />\nharm you if he possibly can. But I have observed far too<br />\nmany petty jealousies and hatreds among you to presume it unnecessary to say.<br />\n<br />\nby Robert I<br />\nAffection is an emotive force. It arises from the<br />\nheart, and while intellect may dictate the need for it,<br />\nstill it remains in the realm of feeling. But in your<br />\noverall mode of conduct, you should seek to employ the<br />\nkind of rational, well-thought-out method I spoke of<br />\nbefore. Your mind is the greatest gift you have, and it<br />\nbesuits you to use it all the time. Every decision you<br />\n<br />\nwl<br />\nas<br />\nw<br />\nn(<br />\nri<br />\nth<br />\ntc<br />\nAdimmin<br />\n<br />\nAte!:Tar&<br />\nSTANDARD<br />\n<br />\nLove all your neighbors and You'll<br />\nmake, every direction you take should be guided by cool<br />\nconsideration. To reason most effectively, the most<br />\nimportant essential is to first compile as much relevant<br />\ninformation as possible. Keep your eyes and ears open,<br />\nand pay attention to everything you are exposed to.<br />\nThat includes this article. It never does you any harm to<br />\npay attention, so long as you remain aware of your<br />\ninalienable right to call any theory or line of argument<br />\nyou can't agree with as bullshit, no matter how sacred<br />\nthe source. But remember this too: some things you'll<br />\nunderstand only after they've had a little time to sink<br />\nin. That might include Marxism. It might also include<br />\nthis message.<br />\nIt's really so simple, this plan for acting according to<br />\nreason. Many people do already try to follow it. But 1<br />\ndaresay very few manage it well, and none perfectly,<br />\nbecause of a few all-too-universal human failings which<br />\nget in the way. The only perfectly reasonable man I've<br />\never heard of was Socrates. That wise Greek's best secret<br />\nwas a realization you could do much worse than to<br />\nemulate: he knew how little he knew. Unbound bY<br />\npreconceptions, he could approach every question with a<br />\nwide open mind. And he also avoided the ubiquitous<br />\nhuman tendency to revere authority. It is true, admittedly, that most people need to be ruled, if only because<br />\nthey are incompetent to decide things for themselves.<br />\nPsychologically, they are like old-style navigators who<br />\nclung to the coasts, cringing at the prospect of losing<br />\nsight of land for fear of falling off the edge of the<br />\nearth. But reader, you are a Hopkins student, and you<br />\nhave sufficient ability to chart your own course. Do not<br />\nbe afraid to do so!<br />\nWhen you are told that eminent psychologist Erik<br />\nErikson has discovered eight critical psychodevelopmental tasks inherent in the development of the<br />\nindividual, or that eminent sociologist Samuel Bowles<br />\nhas proven that the educational system in the United<br />\nStates is a primary determinant of social class, You<br />\nshould take these claims with a grain of salt.

If you use your mind well, you can be just<br />\nas fine a thinker as Marx or Freud. As you read their<br />\nwritings, decide for yourself whether they are right or<br />\nnot. Most likely you will see that almost everyone is<br />\nright about some things and wrong about others.

Self-deception forms a<br />\nforbidding barrier to effective reasoning within many<br />\npeople. You should always be willing to discard your<br />\nown pet theory if somebody else comes along with one<br />\nthat suits the facts better or one based on more extensive information. Even without such a stimulus, constantly reexamine your ideas in light of the new relevant<br />\nfacts that may come to your attention. You must admit<br />\na mistake in your reasoning should you detect one, or an<br />\nerror in your personal conduct. I for one am ready right<br />\nnow to admit such a mistake. Last week, on the editorial<br />\nPage of this newspaper, I showed extremely poor judgement when I asked, \"And by the way, Dr. Pfeffer, how<br />\nmany offers have you had for next year?\" It was mean<br />\nand rather petty to start with, and did no one any good,<br />\nleast of all myself. Further, it did me harm. Dr. Pfeffer is<br />\na bright, talented man, one who is bound to do well and<br />\nto find success in the world one way or another before<br />\nvery long. It can only harm me to have him for an<br />\nimplacable lifelong enemy, but by now I'm pretty much<br />\nresigned to it, which is why I use the case as an example.<br />\nAnother hinderance to avdid in the search for clear<br />\nreasoning and maximum performance is emotional<br />\ninterference. Anxiety in all its forms is such a common<br />\nthought muddler, and so is fear, including nervousness,<br />\nWhich is really fear of failure. Again, this is so easy to<br />\nsee--everybody knows how bad it is to freeze or choke in<br />\nthe clutch, but too few are able to avoid doing so. The<br />\ntrick is, you simply have to make up your mind that<br />\nYou're not going to get angry, selfconscious, og afraid<br />\n(although you might want to pretend to at times if it<br />\nserves a purpose). Because none of these emotions<br />\nCan ever help you; cool composure invariably leads to<br />\nYour best possible performance. In situations where<br />\n<br />\nadrenalin will be needed, don't worry--it will still be<br />\nthere. If you don't believe me, then I recommend that<br />\nyou observe Bob Dandridge of the Washington Bullets in<br />\nthe fourth quarter of a playoff game sometime.<br />\nDandridge also exemplifies one very important<br />\nexception to the rule that irrational considerations<br />\nshould never enter your thought process. You should<br />\nbe confident about anything you try, because confidence can only enhance your performance. In fact,<br />\nconfidence is probably the biggest single ingredient you<br />\nneed for success in whatever you try.<br />\nHow often have you heard it said that within little<br />\nchildrens' fairy tales lie profound meanings? Surely you<br />\nare acquainted with that classic American story of The<br />\nLittle Engine That Could? \"I think I can, I think I can\"<br />\nwas the refrain of that valiant vehicle as it puffed its way<br />\nup the hill. And that should become your refrain as you<br />\npuff your way up the hills of life. Confidence can do<br />\nnothing but help you--as long as you keep a rational<br />\neye on the outcome of your efforts so that you don't<br />\ncontinue confidently banging your head against the wall.<br />\nChrist said, \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,.\" and<br />\nyou should listen to his advice. It just won't do for you<br />\nto pretend to like people--everybody sees through that.<br />\nYou've got to really care. To do that, it often happens<br />\nthat you have to overlook the fact that the person<br />\nyou are caring about dislikes you, or maybe even that he<br />\nor she hates you. That's not easy to do. But if you can<br />\nhandle it, you will be surprised how much power and<br />\ncontrol it gives you over people. More than anything<br />\nelse. we humanc have a deen need to he loved.<br />\nNow you have them: the Three C's. Be Competent,<br />\nCool and Confident and you will come as close to<br />\nwhatever goals you set for yourself as your talent will<br />\ntake you. But getting there, as a lot of ostensibly successful people will tell you, is maybe the easiest part of<br />\nthe problem. What's rough is deciding what you want<br />\nto do in the first place. Hey, you guessed it! I'm going to<br />\ntell you what to do with it, and what I think life should<br />\nbe all about. You can believe me or not, I'm really<br />\nindifferent, but if you're at all interested in the question,<br />\nI suggest it would be beneficial for you to read on.<br />\nHuman beings don't survive well as individuals the<br />\nway creatures such as bears do. We live best in societies.<br />\nEach person makes his contribution to the society and<br />\ntakes his or her rewards from it. We are all like players<br />\non a gigantic team. So by my way of looking at things,<br />\nyou should become the best team players you possibly<br />\ncan. Admittedly, our foresight is rather limited regarding<br />\nwhat would be the best for that team. But fortunately,<br />\n<br />\nnone of us has the power to bring about earth-shattering<br />\nchanges anyway. All we can do is work shortsightedly to<br />\nbring about as much immediate good as possible. The<br />\nchief means for doing this is to help direct, brighten, and<br />\nimprove your own life and the lives of the people around<br />\nyou. Yes, sometimes we must take it on ourselves to<br />\nintrude a bit on the lives of others if we clearly see<br />\nwhat is better for them than they themselves can. That is<br />\ncalled LEADERSHIP. A good everyday example is when<br />\nyou care about somebody enough to devil him or her to<br />\nstop smoking. And there are other, wider applications-I'm sure you can think of them for yourselves.<br />\nOnce absolute dedication to good becomes the<br />\nforemost imperative in your life, everything else kind of<br />\nfalls into place. You can like everyone, and you don't<br />\nreally have to be concerned about the things other<br />\npeople think of you except as it is necessary to manipulate them in order to bring about some good object.<br />\nYour own survival and advancement in the society<br />\ncounts as such an objective if you are fully devoted to<br />\nhelping. Because if it comes to a question of your life<br />\nversus another person's life, you know you will be doing<br />\nyour best if you are still around, while concerning the<br />\nother person's intentions you can never be certain. So<br />\nself-preservatiori is morally justified. So is selfadvancement, because you can almost always bring<br />\nabout more good effects from a higher social status<br />\nthan from a lower one, other things equal. But I warn<br />\nyou, don't allow it to become self-aggrandizement,<br />\nbecause then you lose everything.<br />\nTo put it another way, you can help the team more<br />\nwhen you're playing than when you're sitting on the<br />\nbench. But don't try to be a star--you'll just mess people<br />\nup, and yourself too. As for the position you'll play,<br />\nthat's up to you, to find a niche that suits you. Use the<br />\nThree C's to get there. And wherever you go,remember<br />\nthat the nicest thing you can ever do is to praise and<br />\nencourage the talent in people around you. It helps their<br />\nconfidence, helps them on their way up the ladder, and<br />\nwho knows, one day one of them might do you a favor<br />\ntoo.<br />\nAnd now, my friends, it's time for me to bid you<br />\nfarewell. Even if you think this piece I've written is an<br />\narrogant pomposity, please be advised that I like you<br />\nanyway. I only wish I could mention here all of thd super<br />\npeople who have become special to me during my years<br />\nhere. I'll just have to let it suffice to say, you know who<br />\nyou are. And to all of you out there still with me at this<br />\npoint, thanks, I've enjoyed being here with you a lot.

This weekend, Bob Arellano's playwriting class will<br />\npresent its one-acts, which are usually<br />\nfunny and interesting, at least to the<br />\nextent of seeing fellow students act and<br />\nwrite.

But they have yet<br />\nto receive adequate support<br />\nfrom the University under the<br />\nconditions of Title IX.<br />\nTitle IX is the abbreviated<br />\nlegal name for a passage in the<br />\nEquality in Education Act which<br />\nstates that, in general, women's<br />\nsports should be given the<br />\nsame funding that is given to<br />\nmen's sports. Presently, neither<br />\nJohns Hopkins nor any other<br />\nunitersity complies with these<br />\ngeneral guidelines. As a matter<br />\nof fact, the average expenditure<br />\nfor women's sports in 1977-8<br />\nwas only 20 per cent of the<br />\nbudget allotment for men. At<br />\nHopkins, lacrosse and football<br />\nare given $25,000 annually,<br />\n<br />\nto coach a few sports full-time?<br />\nThe Administration is shaky on<br />\nthis point. Athletic Director<br />\nRobert Scott says, \"The ratio of<br />\nmen's full-time coaches to men's<br />\npart timers is 5:7. The women<br />\nhave a ratio of 3:4.\"<br />\nWhen Scott talks of three<br />\nfull-time coaching jobs he means<br />\nWomen's Athletic Coordinator<br />\nfvlicul Ann Morse in lacrosse and<br />\nfield hockey, and Men's coach<br />\nTim Welsh in women's swimThe<br />\nming.<br />\nAdministration<br />\ndodges on this point again.<br />\nScott is forced to agree that<br />\nalthough there are a total of six<br />\nfull-time male athletic personnel<br />\nwhile women's varsity sports<br />\nsurvive on a pittance.<br />\nOf course, JHU could be<br />\nfair to its women intercollegiate<br />\nathletes, but at what price? To<br />\ngive every woman who plays an<br />\nintercollegiate sport a full size<br />\nlocker ($17) would result in -the<br />\nextreme reduction of locker<br />\n<br />\nspace in the women's locker<br />\nrooms at the Athletic Center. To<br />\ngive the JHU women laundry<br />\nservice would result in a necessary coordination of the uniforms to an orderly place after<br />\neach use, without additional<br />\nstrain being placed on the<br />\ncoaches and their assistants, who<br />\neven the athletes agree are<br />\noverworked.<br />\nIf the coaches are overworked, then why doesn't the<br />\nUniversity hire another woman<br />\nCoach. Even Scott has to admit<br />\n'that there are half of a dozen<br />\nfull-time<br />\nmale<br />\nstaffers,<br />\n(Cox, Welsh, Amen, Ciccarone,<br />\nHorowitz, and Scott himself),<br />\nthere is only one woman who is<br />\n;at the Athletic Center every day<br />\nof the week. Certainly the<br />\ndepartment can pay another<br />\nwoman to coach--or can it?<br />\n\"No,\" Scott says,s. \"It costs<br />\na lot less for three part time<br />\ncont. on p. 22.<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays and Terps kept the<br />\nfans on the edge of their seats<br />\nthroughout the exciting game.<br />\nThe lead passed back and forth,<br />\nas the score was tied ten times.<br />\nAfter jumping out to a 1-0 lead,<br />\nthe Terps were unable to widen<br />\nthe gap, and with the score tied<br />\nat eight apiece following a goal<br />\nby middie Scott Baugher, Jim<br />\nBidne and Wayne Davis combined for a pair within a minute<br />\nto give Hopkins a 10-8 lead,<br />\nafter three quarters.

After sweeping<br />\na four-game series here against<br />\nMilwaukee, they went to Anaheim and took a three-game set<br />\nfrom the Angels, then to Oakland for two out of three, and<br />\nmost recently to Seattle for<br />\nthree more wins.<br />\nBaltimore now stands atop<br />\nthe A.L. East, holding a slim<br />\nhalf-game margin over the Boston Red Sox and a four-game<br />\nlead over the world champion<br />\nNew York Yankees, currently in<br />\nfourth place.<br />\nWhile the Birds have gotten<br />\nsteady pitching from their round<br />\ncorps during the streak, they<br />\nhave been propelled chiefly by<br />\nheavy hitting. In their last nine<br />\ngames, they have banged out<br />\n104 hits to raise their season<br />\nbatting mark to .281. They have<br />\nalso begun cracking home runs<br />\nat a prodigious rate, and the<br />\nteam total now stands at 27 with<br />\nless than a sixth of the season<br />\ngone.<br />\nThe heaviest hitter has been<br />\nKen Singleton, now tied with<br />\nFred Lynn for the league lead<br />\nin home runs with eight. Singleton also sports the best average<br />\nof any regular--.337.<br />\nBut no one player has<br />\ncarried the team. Rich Dauer has<br />\nshaken his perennial opening<br />\nslump at the earliest date ever,<br />\nand has gatheied 13 hits in his<br />\nlast five games to improve his<br />\naverage to .325. Eddie Murray,<br />\nlast season's home run leader,<br />\nhas only one so far, but he has<br />\nhit in 15 straight games and his<br />\nbatting mark stands at .312 with<br />\n17 RBI's.<br />\nGary Roenicke and John<br />\nLowenstein, newcomers to the<br />\nOriole roster this season, have<br />\nboth made important contributions. Each is hitting over .300<br />\nand each has had three home<br />\nruns, Lowenstein in only 15 at<br />\nbats. And both have made<br />\nsignificant improvements over<br />\nlast year's outfield defense.<br />\n<br />\nThe Oriole starting rotation,<br />\nso highly touted before the start<br />\nof the season, has been recovering slowly after a shaky start,<br />\nbut the real pitching star has<br />\nbeen the 6'7\" rookie who the<br />\nplayers call Bigfoot, reliever Tim<br />\nStoddard.<br />\nA teammate of David<br />\nThompson's on the NCAA<br />\nchampionship basketball team<br />\nfrom North Carolina a few years<br />\nago, the rookie Stoddard has<br />\ninspired awe in the hearts of<br />\nmany of the batters he faced in a<br />\n2 1/3 inning string.

Minnesota, Houston and Montreal have<br />\nhardly established reputations as<br />\nworld-beaters.Injuries could prove costly<br />\nto the Orioles. Doug Decinces is<br />\ncurrently on the disabled list<br />\nwith a bad back,, and there is<br />\nnow talk that he may require<br />\nsurgery. Rich Dauer has so far<br />\nfilled in adequately defensively<br />\nat third base, and Dauer's<br />\nreplacement at second, Billy<br />\nSmith, has come up with some<br />\nkey hits. But Decinces's powerful bat could be missed if the<br />\nothers start to cool off.<br />\nAnother even more worrisome problem for the Birds is<br />\nthe status of their ace righthander, Jim Palmer, who has<br />\nalso been plagued by a back<br />\nsprain. Palmer was forced to<br />\nleave the game in the first inning<br />\nof his last game, Sunday against<br />\nOakland. He is scheduled to start<br />\nagain against Don Aase tonight,<br />\nand start he will, because a<br />\nclause in his contract guarantees<br />\nhim a bonus if he starts 30<br />\ngames this season.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 23<br />\n<br />\nSports Profile<br />\n<br />\n=1<br />\n1.<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n,I=16 MUM\u2022MiL<br />\n<br />\nminor.m.<br />\n<br />\nBurns Hurls No-Hitter ;BENEFIT<br />\nBY ANDREW COHEN<br />\nOn Friday, Stcffan Burns,<br />\nthe Blue Jay Varsity Baseball<br />\nTeam's senior captain, capped<br />\noff a brilliant undergraduate<br />\ncareer by hurling a superb 2-0 no<br />\nhit victory at Washington College.

Apart from the<br />\n<br />\nbases allowed on balls, two other<br />\nWashington players reached<br />\nbase. One opponent was hit by a<br />\npitch, and the other took first<br />\nwhen Blue Jay shortstop Bill<br />\nStromberg muffed a pop fly ball<br />\nin the sixth inning. Jay catcher<br />\nBruce Kane defended the streak<br />\nby putting out the one opponent<br />\nwho tried to reach second, on a<br />\nsteal.<br />\nOffensively, the Hopkins<br />\nmen scored their two runs in the<br />\ntop of the third. Outfielder Mike<br />\nApril opened the inning with a<br />\nsingle. One out later second<br />\nbaseman Don Sacho also made a<br />\nhit. The two runners advanced<br />\none base on a successful double<br />\nsteal. With two outs, Kane lined<br />\na base hit to right field, thus<br />\ndriving in both runners for the<br />\n2-0 score.<br />\nGoing into the bottom of<br />\nthe seventh inning, everyone on<br />\nthe Blue Jay team was aware<br />\nthat Steffan was on the verge of<br />\nHopkins baseball history. This<br />\nwas particularly nerve-wracking<br />\nbecause it was not the first time<br />\nthat Steffan had been close to<br />\nno-hitter stardom.<br />\n\"Two years ago, I had a 2-0<br />\nno-hitter going against Swarthmore College,\" Burns recalled,<br />\n\"but in the last inning I not only<br />\nblew the no-hitter, but I blew<br />\nour lead. In the back of my<br />\nmind, I kept thinking about the<br />\n<br />\nSwarthmore game. I knew that<br />\nwith one swing Washington<br />\nCollege could get back into the<br />\ngame. I wanted the no-hitter,<br />\nbut, more importantly,<br />\nwanted to win.\"<br />\nThe seventh inning went<br />\nquite smoothly, and Steffan had<br />\nthe no-hitter. After the last play,<br />\nthe team erupted into cheers of<br />\nhearty congratulations for the<br />\npitching performance. \"It takes<br />\na great deal of luck to pitch a<br />\nno-hitter,\" Burns said. \"At anytime, one of their batters could<br />\nbloop a single, or reach first on a<br />\nslow roller. I am very thrilled<br />\nwith the victory, though.\"<br />\nAs captain of the team,<br />\nSteffan has played a superb<br />\nleadership role. Along with star<br />\npitcher Frank F...arreira, Burns has<br />\nworked closely with the younger<br />\nBlue Jay hurlers.<br />\nSteffan has also been a great<br />\nasset to the entire Hopkins<br />\nathletic program. As a photographer, the senior math major<br />\nhas taken many team photos and<br />\naction shots for all the Blue Jay<br />\nsquads. To his tribute, many of<br />\nhis best sports action photos<br />\npresently hang on the walls in<br />\nthe main office of the Newton<br />\nH.

Everyone, even the Quizmaster, has a bad day now and then.<br />\nWe stand (or cower) corrected on the following: On 11 across, we wanted \"Ann\", but the clue<br />\nsuggested \"Anne.\" The clue for 12 Across (\"An Oriental board game\") was left out for some bizarre<br />\nreason. 14 Across (which should have been 15) was supposed to read, \"The last word, etc.\", not \"The<br />\nlast work.\" Typo. We're told that Mark Twain's first book was not The Gilded Age, but at this point,<br />\nwe care not. 28 Across - Morticia Addams's cousin was \"Itt\", not \"It.\" Then the grand snafu: 31 Across<br />\nshould have read, \"An ostrich-like animal.\" In any case, we accepted either \"Gnu\" or \"Emu:<br />\n\"even<br />\nthough \"Guggenheim\" has an \"m\" at the<br />\nend. (Hold on a sec while I catch my<br />\nbreath.) 14 Down should be, \"The prin1<br />\nM 6<br />\nM<br />\ncess\" (not the \"princes\") \"felt it.\" 8<br />\nNo two ways about it, we screwed up<br />\n(<br />\n9N<br />\n11/1 I<br />\nroyally.

During the<br />\neight rounds of debating, each<br />\nscored by three judges, the<br />\nHopkins team won on 16 of 24<br />\nballots, but could post no better<br />\nthan a three-win, five-loss record<br />\nbecause of losses on split decisions.<br />\nThe team did not obtain the<br />\nmoney it needed to go until<br />\nalmost the last minute. On<br />\nApril 18, the Student Council<br />\nvoted to allocate $845 from the<br />\nStudent Activities Commission<br />\n(SAC) contingency fund, to be<br />\ndeducted from the Debate<br />\nCouncil's 1979-80 budget. Debate Council President Len<br />\nLucchi said, \"I think it's unfair<br />\nthat it has to come out of<br />\nnext year's budget, since we'll<br />\nhave freshmen coming in to<br />\ndebate and since we have a<br />\nteam, Carl Glitzenstein and Jim<br />\nDeSimone, which looks very<br />\npromising for next year. They<br />\njust missed qualifying for the<br />\nnationals this time around.\"<br />\nLucchi noted that Hopkins<br />\nhad been one of only three<br />\nschools in the country to send<br />\ntwo teams to the nationals in<br />\neach of the previous two years.<br />\nAt that time the debators<br />\nreceived funding for the trip in a<br />\npackage assembled by then-Dean<br />\nof Students Jakie Hall from<br />\nvarious University sources outside the SAC, including the<br />\nalumni, but this year such<br />\nfunding was unavailable.<br />\nLucchi complained that<br />\nthe uncertainty of their funding<br />\nhindered the team. \"Not knowing they'd go until the last<br />\nminute hurt Sue's and Greg's<br />\npreparation,\" he said.<br />\nAccording to Lucchi and<br /><br />\nHughes, the debaters first<br />\napproached the SAC executive<br />\nboard for money, but the SAC<br />\nsent them around to various<br />\ndeans, none of whom gave them<br />\nhelp.

The Conservative victory in the British<br />\nparliamentary elections has carried Margaret Thatcher as<br />\nEngland's first-ever woman Prime Minister.<br />\nMrs. Thatcher's election marks the first time ever in<br />\nthe history of Western republican government that a<br />\nwoman has ever become a democratically-elected head of<br />\nstate without being a relative of some departed leader, as<br />\nin the cases of Indira Gandhi and Isabel Peron. Although<br />\nher actual campaign success prior to yeesterday's election<br />\nwas far from impressive, and though her triumph was<br />\ncertainly due more to party platform than to personal<br />\ncharisma, her achievement is nevertheless remarkable.<br />\nLook how far women have already come, and in what<br />\na short time. Only 80 years ago, women could be considered radicals just for urging that women be given the right<br />\nto vote. And how distant we still seem from the day when<br />\na woman could become President, or even leader of<br />\na party in Congress. More than anything, Thatcher's<br />\nelection should show us how possible it is for times to<br />\nchange.<br />\nAnd times are indeed changing. Birth control technology now permits women to enjoy normal adult sex lives<br />\nwithout pregnancy or children except as they decide. And<br />\nmechanization allows them to become just as valuable<br />\neconomically as men. These represent real bonds from<br />\nwhich women have been freed, a liberation which has<br />\nfundamentally altered and improved the fundamental<br />\ncondition of life for women.<br />\nNow it is time for women to shed their political chains<br />\nas well. Men had better resign themselves to accept it. In<br />\nthe end, we'll all be better off.<br /><br />\nTeam Spirit<br />\nThe Student Council two weeks ago set up a policy of<br />\nrefusing to fund student activity team expenses incurred<br />\nfor competition away from Homewood. Specifically, in<br />\ndenying the Debate Council anything more than a temporary loan from the SAC contingency fund, the SC<br />\nargued that an event which takes place away from the<br />\ncampus is of no value to any students except the ones on<br />\nthe team, and so merits no expense reimbursement from<br />\nthe general student activity fund.<br />\nThe Council's reasoning is inconsistent, however. A<br />\ngroup such as, say, the Jewish Student Association funds a<br />\nconsiderable number of events such as Oneg Shabbats<br />\nduring the year which are of no value to any but the members of the organization. Still, you might argue that any<br />\nstudent is welcome to attend the Jewish services. An even<br />\nbetter example is the Outdoors Club. Only members of the<br />\nOutdoors Club can benefit from the SAC-funding allotted<br />\nto that group, which nobody has yet tried to abolish. You<br />\ncould say that any student could join the Outdoors Club,<br />\nbut then, so could any student join the Debate Club. The<br />\nCouncil clearly has established a double standard.<br />\nAnd even if expenses of groups like the Debate or<br />\nChess team are not funded through the SAC, they should<br />\nnevertheless receive enough money from general sources to<br />\ncontinue their travels.<br />\nAlthough competitive teams do not directly benefit<br />\nstudents on this campus, however, no one can deny that<br />\nthey benefit the university as a whole. By engaging in<br />\ntournaments across the country, these groups help publicize Hopkins.

However, I still cannot<br />\nhelp but wonder if the response<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nto his murder is somewhat<br />\ndehumanizing. Specifically, I am<br />\nreferring to the University's<br />\neffort to improve the safety of<br />\nits students and employees in<br />\nthe East Baltimore campus by<br />\nincreasing the number of security guards there, providing more<br />\nparking spaces closer to the<br />\nhospital, fortifying the camera<br />\nsurveillance of the hospital area,<br />\nand so forth. I do not question<br />\nwhether or not these improvements are needed; I question<br />\nwhy the University with all of its<br />\ninfluential scholars and vast<br />\nresources cannot determine why<br />\nconditions that necessitate them<br />\nexist. In other words, why does<br />\nthe University allow the perpetuation of the ghetto in East<br />\nBaltimore?<br />\nMaking the hospital a \"better fortress,\" to me, is the same<br />\nas adopting the attitude,\"As the<br />\nair quality gets worse and worse,<br />\nwe'll have to build better and<br />\nbetter gas masks.\" Wouldn't we<br />\nall be better off in the long run<br /><br />\nif we are able to get to the root<br />\nof the problem: stopping air<br />\npollution? Similarly, wouldn't<br />\nwe all be better off if we could<br />\ndetermine what factors cause<br />\npeople to commit crimes and<br />\neliminate them?<br />\nIt doesn't take a person<br />\nwith any great insight to realize<br />\nthat one such factor is inequality<br />\namong people (e.g., poverty vs.<br />\naffluence). Certainly there will<br />\nalways be inequality, but I am<br />\nreferring to the extreme cases.<br />\nFor example, is it necessary for<br />\none person to earn $100,000 per<br />\nyear and own a forty-foot yacht,<br />\nwhile another person can only<br />\nearn $8000 per year, and must<br />\nspend the rest of his life living<br />\nin an infested tenement? Can't<br />\neverybody benefit from the<br />\neconomic system in reasonable<br />\nmanner? Some would argue that<br />\na capitalistic economic system<br />\ndoes not allow such more or less<br />\neven distribution of wealth and<br />\nthat government intervention<br />\nwould be necessary. However, I<br />\nfeel sometimes, social pressure<br />\ncan be more effective than<br />\nlegislature. The key is to think in<br />\nterms of a generalized social<br />\nmovement involving all people,<br />\ninstead of a struggle between<br />\nclasses.<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\nHopkins<br />\ndoes little to encourage this<br />\n\"everybody can benefit\" attitude among its students. Instead,<br /><br />\nmost students come away believing in the doctrine of survival of<br />\nthe fittest. And why not?<br />\nCompetition for grades, competition for housing, competition<br />\nfor jobs all encourage this type<br />\nof thinking. Instead of thinking<br />\nin terms of the whole, each<br />\nstudent is taught to worry about<br />\nhis own happiness. There are<br />\nexceptions, of course, with some<br />\npeople trying to discourage this<br />\nselfish thinking, but on the<br />\nwhole, it seems the students are<br />\nencouraged to be egocentric.<br />\nCommon sense suggests that<br />\nmaking the hospital a fortress<br />\nwith higher walls only serves to<br />\nseparate the people instead of<br />\nprotecting them. In this separation the value and quality of<br />\nsome human life declines (the<br />\npoor) while that of others<br />\nincreases (the affluent). The<br />\nfinal irony of the situation is<br />\nthat Hopkins plans to build a<br />\n$1.7 million dollar athletic center downtown in the middle<br />\nof the ghetto area. Who will<br />\nbenefit from this athletic center?<br />\nWill everybody benefit?

This one exists for no other<br />\npurpose than to do you good. You would be welladvised to read it, all of it, part of it, or until you get<br />\ntired of it. You might think it's full of shit and if you do<br />\nthat's fine. But if you care what's good for you, you'll<br />\nread it first, then decide.<br />\nAll I'm really going to say are some rather simple<br />\ntruths which should be obvious to everyone, except that<br />\nthey're too often obscured by the social and psychological environment we live in. About faculty, for one<br />\nthing. Professors are no more intelligent than students.<br />\nThey simplS, hold a more exalted status within the<br />\ncontext of an academic institution. Each possesses a<br />\ngood deal more knowledge than any undergraduate<br />\nin the realm of some specialized form of inquiry. Absurdly specialized, most of them, if you think about it,<br />\nand the same is true of over 75% of the material in<br />\nmost of the courses they teach. Professors got to be<br />\nwhere they are today not through sheer reasoning<br />\nability, but by hard work and by skill in the academic<br />\ngame, the same game at which students who wind up<br />\nwith Phi Beta Kappaesque GPA's excel. The purpose of<br />\nplaying the game for many has been to avoid risking<br />\nthe uncertainties of the outside world. Not that they<br />\ndidn't do the right thing by playing--if a man has made it<br />\non to the Hopkins faculty, you have got to figure<br />\nhe is a pretty good player. But not that he is smarter<br />\nthan you are. It's just that right now, you are forced to<br />\nplay his game. Later on,things will be different.<br /><br />\nOur Editor is also well aware how little he knows.<br />\nYou ought to reflect for a while on just what you<br />\nare getting from your years at Johns Hopkins. The<br />\nofficially prescribed goal, of course, is a degree--some<br />\npretty writing inscribed on a fancy piece of paper. That<br />\nbit of paper does carry some weight in our society. But<br />\nnot as much as Hopkins students think it ought to. It's<br />\njust enough to get you into another rat race at a graduate school if that's the route you choose, it might not<br />\nget you out of the draft if they start that again, and it's<br />\nalmost certainly not the ticket to the job of your dreams<br />\nunless your major happens to be engineering.<br />\nMost of us are already too familiar with this state of<br /><br />\naffairs. It produces considerable anxiety for many<br />\namong you, especially those now nearing a departure<br />\ndate. But as we are all nearing our departure dates in<br />\none way or another, you should all consider this: It's<br />\nnot the degree you get that really counts, it's what you<br />\ncan do. In one word,COMPETENCE. If in whatever task<br />\nfalls to you over the years you can take command, get<br />\nyour shit together and get the job done, then people will<br />\nnotice you. There aren't that many people out there<br />\nwho can bring home the bacon when it counts. That's<br />\nwhy the work people do for such enterprises as the<br />\nNews-Letter is more important than the hours of toil<br />\nthey pour into academic charades which will prove<br />\nlargely irrelevant in the long run. Of course, your sense<br />\nof competence also profits from learning to get your<br />\nschoolwork done. But the more important benefit you<br />\nget from classes here is that they can possibly teach you<br />\nto think. When you are exposed in a course to a man like<br />\nOrest Ranum, or Jerry Cooper, and there are many<br />\nothers like them on our generally excellent faculty,<br />\ndon't worry about how well he thinks, but pay attention<br />\nto how well he thinks. For the key to achievement is not<br />\nthe speed or extreme accuracy of your mental functioning, but the method with which you use it. You<br />\nmust by all means think about the method you will use<br />\nin approaching the problems life confronts you with.<br />\nIf you develop such a method and a sense of competence by the time you leave here, you will have gotten<br />\nyour money's worth from Johns Hopkins, whether<br />\nyou're admitted to medical school, law school, etc., or<br />\nno. But at the same time you must realize that the<br />\npeople you meet here have the potential for playing an<br />\nenormous role in your life, and in the life of the whole<br />\ncountry for that matter, after you leave. Somebody<br />\nnow at Hopkins could well become president of IBM,or<br />\nSurgeon General, or Secretary of State. And what is he<br />\ndoing now? He's one of us, a measly little student. More<br />\nthan one of the people who surround you will become a<br />\nhero. Most everyone now at Homewood will one day<br />\nachieve a higher social status than the one he now holds,<br />\nnamely that of a lowly college student. Most, I predict, will reach much higher. The undergraduates admitted to Hopkins are good in the first place--only one of<br />\nseven applicants is taken. The people who hold high<br />\nstatus positions now will one day grow old and go away.<br />\nSomeone will be needed to replace them, and no one<br />\nwill be more competent to do so than the people who<br />\nare now university students here. If you, reader, are a<br />\nHopkins student, the chances are excellent that one day<br />\nyou will be an important person in our country. The old<br />\nsaying applies so well here: CREAM WILL RISE TO<br />\nTHE TOP.<br />\nhis does not mean the same cream that rose to the<br />\ntop in the academic pressure cooker here. First of all.<br />\nevery Hopkins student is a very capable person, else he'<br />\nwouldn't be here. A recent study showed that a top group<br />\nof performers at a prominent Eastern university were<br />\nfound a decade later to be less successful both professionally and personally -than the median group of the<br />\nsame size, that is, kids who stood right in the middle.<br />\nRemember what I said about the academic game\u2014othei<br />\nthings you learn and do are more important than the<br />\ngrades you get.<br />\nNow have you got that? I hope so, because even if<br />\nyou haven't I'm going to start you on the next chapter<br />\nanyway. It should be obvious to you by now why<br />\nyou should make as many friends as possible while you<br />\nare here, and all the time, for that matter. Not only are<br />\nthe nice people here fun to be with, but a friend you<br />\nmake now might well be able to help you out when you<br />\nneed it somewhere down the line. Boosts from your<br />\nfriends can definitely send you places, and sometimes<br />\nthey might be the chief prerequisite for getting somewhere even if you have ability. In fact, friends are<br />\nespecially important to have if you are competent,<br />\nbecause once you get your foot in the door, the rest will<br />\nbe easy for you. To all you Hopkins students out there<br />\nreading this, it should be no problem for you to comprehend that you should LIKE EVERYONE. No enemy<br />\nyou ever made is going to do anything for you except to<br />\nharm you if he possibly can. But I have observed far too<br />\nmany petty jealousies and hatreds among you to presume it unnecessary to say.<br /><br />\nby Robert I<br />\nAffection is an emotive force. It arises from the<br />\nheart, and while intellect may dictate the need for it,<br />\nstill it remains in the realm of feeling. But in your<br />\noverall mode of conduct, you should seek to employ the<br />\nkind of rational, well-thought-out method I spoke of<br />\nbefore. Your mind is the greatest gift you have, and it<br />\nbesuits you to use it all the time.

To reason most effectively, the most<br />\nimportant essential is to first compile as much relevant<br />\ninformation as possible. Keep your eyes and ears open,<br />\nand pay attention to everything you are exposed to.<br />\nThat includes this article. It never does you any harm to<br />\npay attention, so long as you remain aware of your<br />\ninalienable right to call any theory or line of argument<br />\nyou can't agree with as bullshit, no matter how sacred<br />\nthe source. But remember this too: some things you'll<br />\nunderstand only after they've had a little time to sink<br />\nin. That might include Marxism. It might also include<br />\nthis message.<br />\nIt's really so simple, this plan for acting according to<br />\nreason. Many people do already try to follow it. But 1<br />\ndaresay very few manage it well, and none perfectly,<br />\nbecause of a few all-too-universal human failings which<br />\nget in the way. The only perfectly reasonable man I've<br />\never heard of was Socrates. That wise Greek's best secret<br />\nwas a realization you could do much worse than to<br />\nemulate: he knew how little he knew.

Self-deception forms a<br />\nforbidding barrier to effective reasoning within many<br />\npeople. You should always be willing to discard your<br />\nown pet theory if somebody else comes along with one<br />\nthat suits the facts better or one based on more extensive information. Even without such a stimulus, constantly reexamine your ideas in light of the new relevant<br />\nfacts that may come to your attention. You must admit<br />\na mistake in your reasoning should you detect one, or an<br />\nerror in your personal conduct. I for one am ready right<br />\nnow to admit such a mistake. Last week, on the editorial<br />\nPage of this newspaper, I showed extremely poor judgement when I asked, \"And by the way, Dr. Pfeffer, how<br />\nmany offers have you had for next year?\" It was mean<br />\nand rather petty to start with, and did no one any good,<br />\nleast of all myself. Further, it did me harm. Dr. Pfeffer is<br />\na bright, talented man, one who is bound to do well and<br />\nto find success in the world one way or another before<br />\nvery long. It can only harm me to have him for an<br />\nimplacable lifelong enemy, but by now I'm pretty much<br />\nresigned to it, which is why I use the case as an example.<br />\nAnother hinderance to avdid in the search for clear<br />\nreasoning and maximum performance is emotional<br />\ninterference. Anxiety in all its forms is such a common<br />\nthought muddler, and so is fear, including nervousness,<br />\nWhich is really fear of failure. Again, this is so easy to<br />\nsee--everybody knows how bad it is to freeze or choke in<br />\nthe clutch, but too few are able to avoid doing so. The<br />\ntrick is, you simply have to make up your mind that<br />\nYou're not going to get angry, selfconscious, og afraid<br />\n(although you might want to pretend to at times if it<br />\nserves a purpose). Because none of these emotions<br />\nCan ever help you; cool composure invariably leads to<br />\nYour best possible performance. In situations where<br /><br />\nadrenalin will be needed, don't worry--it will still be<br />\nthere. If you don't believe me, then I recommend that<br />\nyou observe Bob Dandridge of the Washington Bullets in<br />\nthe fourth quarter of a playoff game sometime.<br />\nDandridge also exemplifies one very important<br />\nexception to the rule that irrational considerations<br />\nshould never enter your thought process. You should<br />\nbe confident about anything you try, because confidence can only enhance your performance. In fact,<br />\nconfidence is probably the biggest single ingredient you<br />\nneed for success in whatever you try.<br />\nHow often have you heard it said that within little<br />\nchildrens' fairy tales lie profound meanings? Surely you<br />\nare acquainted with that classic American story of The<br />\nLittle Engine That Could? \"I think I can, I think I can\"<br />\nwas the refrain of that valiant vehicle as it puffed its way<br />\nup the hill. And that should become your refrain as you<br />\npuff your way up the hills of life. Confidence can do<br />\nnothing but help you--as long as you keep a rational<br />\neye on the outcome of your efforts so that you don't<br />\ncontinue confidently banging your head against the wall.<br />\nChrist said, \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,.\" and<br />\nyou should listen to his advice. It just won't do for you<br />\nto pretend to like people--everybody sees through that.<br />\nYou've got to really care. To do that, it often happens<br />\nthat you have to overlook the fact that the person<br />\nyou are caring about dislikes you, or maybe even that he<br />\nor she hates you. That's not easy to do. But if you can<br />\nhandle it, you will be surprised how much power and<br />\ncontrol it gives you over people. More than anything<br />\nelse. we humanc have a deen need to he loved.<br />\nNow you have them: the Three C's. Be Competent,<br />\nCool and Confident and you will come as close to<br />\nwhatever goals you set for yourself as your talent will<br />\ntake you. But getting there, as a lot of ostensibly successful people will tell you, is maybe the easiest part of<br />\nthe problem. What's rough is deciding what you want<br />\nto do in the first place. Hey, you guessed it! I'm going to<br />\ntell you what to do with it, and what I think life should<br />\nbe all about. You can believe me or not, I'm really<br />\nindifferent, but if you're at all interested in the question,<br />\nI suggest it would be beneficial for you to read on.<br />\nHuman beings don't survive well as individuals the<br />\nway creatures such as bears do. We live best in societies.<br />\nEach person makes his contribution to the society and<br />\ntakes his or her rewards from it. We are all like players<br />\non a gigantic team. So by my way of looking at things,<br />\nyou should become the best team players you possibly<br />\ncan. Admittedly, our foresight is rather limited regarding<br />\nwhat would be the best for that team. But fortunately,<br /><br />\nnone of us has the power to bring about earth-shattering<br />\nchanges anyway. All we can do is work shortsightedly to<br />\nbring about as much immediate good as possible. The<br />\nchief means for doing this is to help direct, brighten, and<br />\nimprove your own life and the lives of the people around<br />\nyou. Yes, sometimes we must take it on ourselves to<br />\nintrude a bit on the lives of others if we clearly see<br />\nwhat is better for them than they themselves can. That is<br />\ncalled LEADERSHIP. A good everyday example is when<br />\nyou care about somebody enough to devil him or her to<br />\nstop smoking. And there are other, wider applications-I'm sure you can think of them for yourselves.<br />\nOnce absolute dedication to good becomes the<br />\nforemost imperative in your life, everything else kind of<br />\nfalls into place. You can like everyone, and you don't<br />\nreally have to be concerned about the things other<br />\npeople think of you except as it is necessary to manipulate them in order to bring about some good object.<br />\nYour own survival and advancement in the society<br />\ncounts as such an objective if you are fully devoted to<br />\nhelping. Because if it comes to a question of your life<br />\nversus another person's life, you know you will be doing<br />\nyour best if you are still around, while concerning the<br />\nother person's intentions you can never be certain. So<br />\nself-preservatiori is morally justified. So is selfadvancement, because you can almost always bring<br />\nabout more good effects from a higher social status<br />\nthan from a lower one, other things equal. But I warn<br />\nyou, don't allow it to become self-aggrandizement,<br />\nbecause then you lose everything.<br />\nTo put it another way, you can help the team more<br />\nwhen you're playing than when you're sitting on the<br />\nbench. But don't try to be a star--you'll just mess people<br />\nup, and yourself too. As for the position you'll play,<br />\nthat's up to you, to find a niche that suits you. Use the<br />\nThree C's to get there. And wherever you go,remember<br />\nthat the nicest thing you can ever do is to praise and<br />\nencourage the talent in people around you. It helps their<br />\nconfidence, helps them on their way up the ladder, and<br />\nwho knows, one day one of them might do you a favor<br />\ntoo.<br />\nAnd now, my friends, it's time for me to bid you<br />\nfarewell. Even if you think this piece I've written is an<br />\narrogant pomposity, please be advised that I like you<br />\nanyway. I only wish I could mention here all of thd super<br />\npeople who have become special to me during my years<br />\nhere. I'll just have to let it suffice to say, you know who<br />\nyou are. And to all of you out there still with me at this<br />\npoint, thanks, I've enjoyed being here with you a lot.

But they have yet<br />\nto receive adequate support<br />\nfrom the University under the<br />\nconditions of Title IX.<br />\nTitle IX is the abbreviated<br />\nlegal name for a passage in the<br />\nEquality in Education Act which<br />\nstates that, in general, women's<br />\nsports should be given the<br />\nsame funding that is given to<br />\nmen's sports. Presently, neither<br />\nJohns Hopkins nor any other<br />\nunitersity complies with these<br />\ngeneral guidelines. As a matter<br />\nof fact, the average expenditure<br />\nfor women's sports in 1977-8<br />\nwas only 20 per cent of the<br />\nbudget allotment for men. At<br />\nHopkins, lacrosse and football<br />\nare given $25,000 annually,<br /><br />\nto coach a few sports full-time?<br />\nThe Administration is shaky on<br />\nthis point. Athletic Director<br />\nRobert Scott says, \"The ratio of<br />\nmen's full-time coaches to men's<br />\npart timers is 5:7. The women<br />\nhave a ratio of 3:4.\"<br />\nWhen Scott talks of three<br />\nfull-time coaching jobs he means<br />\nWomen's Athletic Coordinator<br />\nfvlicul Ann Morse in lacrosse and<br />\nfield hockey, and Men's coach<br />\nTim Welsh in women's swimThe<br />\nming.<br />\nAdministration<br />\ndodges on this point again.<br />\nScott is forced to agree that<br />\nalthough there are a total of six<br />\nfull-time male athletic personnel<br />\nwhile women's varsity sports<br />\nsurvive on a pittance.<br />\nOf course, JHU could be<br />\nfair to its women intercollegiate<br />\nathletes, but at what price? To<br />\ngive every woman who plays an<br />\nintercollegiate sport a full size<br />\nlocker ($17) would result in -the<br />\nextreme reduction of locker<br /><br />\nspace in the women's locker<br />\nrooms at the Athletic Center. To<br />\ngive the JHU women laundry<br />\nservice would result in a necessary coordination of the uniforms to an orderly place after<br />\neach use, without additional<br />\nstrain being placed on the<br />\ncoaches and their assistants, who<br />\neven the athletes agree are<br />\noverworked.<br />\nIf the coaches are overworked, then why doesn't the<br />\nUniversity hire another woman<br />\nCoach. Even Scott has to admit<br />\n'that there are half of a dozen<br />\nfull-time<br />\nmale<br />\nstaffers,<br />\n(Cox, Welsh, Amen, Ciccarone,<br />\nHorowitz, and Scott himself),<br />\nthere is only one woman who is<br />\n;at the Athletic Center every day<br />\nof the week. Certainly the<br />\ndepartment can pay another<br />\nwoman to coach--or can it?<br />\n\"No,\" Scott says,s. \"It costs<br />\na lot less for three part time<br />\ncont. on p. 22.<br /><br />\nThe Jays and Terps kept the<br />\nfans on the edge of their seats<br />\nthroughout the exciting game.<br />\nThe lead passed back and forth,<br />\nas the score was tied ten times.<br />\nAfter jumping out to a 1-0 lead,<br />\nthe Terps were unable to widen<br />\nthe gap, and with the score tied<br />\nat eight apiece following a goal<br />\nby middie Scott Baugher, Jim<br />\nBidne and Wayne Davis combined for a pair within a minute<br />\nto give Hopkins a 10-8 lead,<br />\nafter three quarters.

Stoddard<br />\nleads the team in strikeouts even<br />\nthough he has been used only<br />\nfor short relief work. His t.R.A.<br />\nis 1.35.<br />\nThough the team is encouraged by its strong pennant<br />\nperformance, it is still way too<br />\nearly for pennant talk, as manager Earl Weaver admitted yesterday. Last year, the Orioles<br />\nwent 8-0 on their first West<br />\nCoast trip, but were unable to<br />\nsustain their drive and finished<br />\nfourth.<br />\nThen, too, a glance at the<br />\nstandings in the other three<br />\ndivisions reveals that none of<br />\nthe leaders would be better than<br />\na 5-1 bet to wind up on top at<br />\nthe end of the season. Minnesota, Houston and Montreal have<br />\nhardly established reputations as<br />\nworld-beaters.Injuries could prove costly<br />\nto the Orioles. Doug Decinces is<br />\ncurrently on the disabled list<br />\nwith a bad back,, and there is<br />\nnow talk that he may require<br />\nsurgery. Rich Dauer has so far<br />\nfilled in adequately defensively<br />\nat third base, and Dauer's<br />\nreplacement at second, Billy<br />\nSmith, has come up with some<br />\nkey hits. But Decinces's powerful bat could be missed if the<br />\nothers start to cool off.<br />\nAnother even more worrisome problem for the Birds is<br />\nthe status of their ace righthander, Jim Palmer, who has<br />\nalso been plagued by a back<br />\nsprain. Palmer was forced to<br />\nleave the game in the first inning<br />\nof his last game, Sunday against<br />\nOakland. He is scheduled to start<br />\nagain against Don Aase tonight,<br />\nand start he will, because a<br />\nclause in his contract guarantees<br />\nhim a bonus if he starts 30<br />\ngames this season.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 23<br /><br />\nSports Profile<br /><br />\n=1<br />\n1.<br />\n'<br /><br />\n,I=16 MUM\u2022MiL<br /><br />\nminor.m.<br /><br />\nBurns Hurls No-Hitter ;BENEFIT<br />\nBY ANDREW COHEN<br />\nOn Friday, Stcffan Burns,<br />\nthe Blue Jay Varsity Baseball<br />\nTeam's senior captain, capped<br />\noff a brilliant undergraduate<br />\ncareer by hurling a superb 2-0 no<br />\nhit victory at Washington College. The no-hitter was Burns's<br />\nfirst in his scholastic pitching<br />\nefforts and the Jays' first in a<br />\nlong,long time.<br />\n\"The game Steffan pitched<br />\nwas absolutely brilliant,\" commented Coach Denny Cox.<br />\n\"Steff is probably the most<br />\nexperienced pitcher on our<br />\nteam. He has great knowledge of<br />\nthe game, throws hard when he<br />\nhas to, and has precise control.\"<br />\nThe ballgame was the<br />\nsecond of a doubleheader with<br />\nWashington College. In the first<br />\ngame Blue Jay hurler Steve Hand<br />\nwas battered in an 8-5 defeat.<br />\nFollowing the first-game explosion by the Shoremen, Steffan<br />\nhoped only to cool the Washington bats in the nightcap.<br />\n\"I felt fine physically before<br />\nthe game,\" Burns explained,<br />\n\"but I was a little nervous<br />\nbecause of the first game outcome. The long two hour<br />\nride to Washington College was<br />\nno joy either.\"<br />\nSteffan dominated the second inning contest, striking out<br />\nfour batters while issuing only<br />\nthree walks. Apart from the<br /><br />\nbases allowed on balls, two other<br />\nWashington players reached<br />\nbase. One opponent was hit by a<br />\npitch, and the other took first<br />\nwhen Blue Jay shortstop Bill<br />\nStromberg muffed a pop fly ball<br />\nin the sixth inning. Jay catcher<br />\nBruce Kane defended the streak<br />\nby putting out the one opponent<br />\nwho tried to reach second, on a<br />\nsteal.<br />\nOffensively, the Hopkins<br />\nmen scored their two runs in the<br />\ntop of the third. Outfielder Mike<br />\nApril opened the inning with a<br />\nsingle. One out later second<br />\nbaseman Don Sacho also made a<br />\nhit. The two runners advanced<br />\none base on a successful double<br />\nsteal. With two outs, Kane lined<br />\na base hit to right field, thus<br />\ndriving in both runners for the<br />\n2-0 score.<br />\nGoing into the bottom of<br />\nthe seventh inning, everyone on<br />\nthe Blue Jay team was aware<br />\nthat Steffan was on the verge of<br />\nHopkins baseball history. This<br />\nwas particularly nerve-wracking<br />\nbecause it was not the first time<br />\nthat Steffan had been close to<br />\nno-hitter stardom.<br />\n\"Two years ago, I had a 2-0<br />\nno-hitter going against Swarthmore College,\" Burns recalled,<br />\n\"but in the last inning I not only<br />\nblew the no-hitter, but I blew<br />\nour lead. In the back of my<br />\nmind, I kept thinking about the<br /><br />\nSwarthmore game. I knew that<br />\nwith one swing Washington<br />\nCollege could get back into the<br />\ngame. I wanted the no-hitter,<br />\nbut, more importantly,<br />\nwanted to win.\"<br />\nThe seventh inning went<br />\nquite smoothly, and Steffan had<br />\nthe no-hitter. After the last play,<br />\nthe team erupted into cheers of<br />\nhearty congratulations for the<br />\npitching performance. \"It takes<br />\na great deal of luck to pitch a<br />\nno-hitter,\" Burns said. \"At anytime, one of their batters could<br />\nbloop a single, or reach first on a<br />\nslow roller. I am very thrilled<br />\nwith the victory, though.\"<br />\nAs captain of the team,<br />\nSteffan has played a superb<br />\nleadership role. Along with star<br />\npitcher Frank F...arreira, Burns has<br />\nworked closely with the younger<br />\nBlue Jay hurlers.<br />\nSteffan has also been a great<br />\nasset to the entire Hopkins<br />\nathletic program. As a photographer, the senior math major<br />\nhas taken many team photos and<br />\naction shots for all the Blue Jay<br />\nsquads. To his tribute, many of<br />\nhis best sports action photos<br />\npresently hang on the walls in<br />\nthe main office of the Newton<br />\nH. White Athletic Center.<br />\nSteffan will be sorely missed by<br />\nthe athletics departments when<br />\nhe departs for graduate school at<br />\nEmory University next year.<br /><br />\nDISCO<br />\nThurs.
