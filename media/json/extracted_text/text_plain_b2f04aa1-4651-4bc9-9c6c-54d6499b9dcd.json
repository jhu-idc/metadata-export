The<br />\nPossibility of purchasing an<br />\napartment building off-campus<br />\nand of building new dormitories<br />\non campus will be investigated.<br />\nAll administrators involved<br />\nWith the Housing investigation<br />\nwho were interviewed yesterday<br />\nsaid they believe there is a<br />\ndefinite need for housing.<br />\n\"I'm convinced that there's a<br />\nneed,\" stated Dean of Students<br />\nJakie Hall. \"I'm shaky, though,<br />\non just what that need is.\"<br />\n\"There's no question<br />\nadditional housing is needed,\"<br />\nsaid Ross Jones, Vice President<br />\nfor University Affairs. \u2014The<br />\nquestion is what the numbers<br />\nare.\"<br />\nThe examination of the<br />\n<br />\nhousing situation was a result of<br />\nseveral stimuli, according to Hall.<br />\nLast year's Housing Report by<br />\nthe Student Council, complaints<br />\nand concerns voiced t?Sy present<br />\nstudents and concerns of possible<br />\nfuture students and their pareqts<br />\nconvinced President Muller tha't,<br />\nin his words, \"we really ought tc<br />\ngive this a full-dress thorough<br />\nreview.\"<br />\nThe decision to examine the<br />\npossibility of acquiring more<br />\nhousing represents a shift in the<br />\nUniversity's attitude towards the<br />\nsituation. In the past few years,<br />\nadministrators have held to the<br />\nposition that housing in the<br />\ncommunity would sufficiently<br />\nsupplement University-owned<br />\nhousing.<br />\nHowever, serious difficulties<br />\nwould arise in implementing<br />\neither housing option.<br />\nMuller asserted that the cost of<br />\nbuilding new housing is<br />\nprohibitive. The University<br />\nwould not be able to amortize<br />\nthe cost of the construction<br />\nthrough .rents comparable to<br />\nthose charged now.<br />\nBuilding new residences would<br />\nmean either raising rents<br />\ndfastically, or having the<br />\nUniversity subsidize housing, a<br />\ndeviation from its present policy.<br />\nBut buying an apartment<br />\nbuilding off-campus would meet<br />\nwith serious opposition from the<br />\nHomewood community, Jones<br />\n<br />\nacknowledged!.<br />\nSaid Jones, \"We're- sensitive to<br />\nthe problem of disrupting<br />\npeople's lives who are already in<br />\nthese places.\"<br />\nan immediate measure to<br />\nrelieve the Housing problems for<br />\nHopkins students, the Uuiversity<br />\nappointed Belva Scat* to the<br />\nne'vv.1 Y-created tiosition of<br />\nC4-oidinator of Off-Campus<br />\nHousing.<br />\nHall asserted that Scott will be<br />\nable to help assess.the availability<br />\nof off-campus housing.<br />\nScott stated<br />\nthat the<br />\nUniversity is going to have a hard<br />\ntime finding a suitable apartment<br />\nfor use. Opposition to University<br />\n<br />\nexpansion into the community<br />\nwas evident last spring as the<br />\nGreater Homewood Community<br />\nCorporation protested strongly<br />\nHopkins' purchase of the<br />\nGladwyn Manor at 3201 N.<br />\nCharles for office space.<br />\nScott said that the major<br />\nproblem thus far has not been a<br />\nlack of housing but a lack of<br />\ngood housing that satisfies the<br />\nstudent resident.<br />\nAnother major housing<br />\nproblem is unscrupulous<br />\nlandlords who take advantage of<br />\nstudents, she said. \"We hope to<br />\nbe able to warn students about<br />\nthe bad landlords,'' she<br />\ncontinued.<br />\n<br />\nHonor Code alternative in sight<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nWithin a month the University<br />\nshould at last have a viable<br />\nalternative to the Honor Code<br />\nwhich .was maintained for 67<br />\nyears before its termination by<br />\nstudent referendum last April.<br />\nThe Code will be replaced by a<br />\nloosely-structured proctoring<br />\nsystem formulated by a special<br />\nStudent Council committee and<br />\napproved by the student body.<br />\nPending its approval by the<br />\nAcademic Council and the<br />\nStudent Council later this month,<br />\n<br />\nthis document will become the<br />\nofficial University governance<br />\nsystem for academic offenses,<br />\nreplacing what Dean of Academic<br />\nPrograms Sigmund Suskind calls<br />\n\"the present non-system.\"<br />\nA task force of faculty and<br />\nstudents worked on the proposal<br />\nlast summer, making minor<br />\nrevisions on the recommendation<br />\nof the Academic Council.

I had visited China, in<br />\n1972, and I had gotten a very<br />\nstrong and positive impression of<br />\ntheir educational system, which<br />\ncombines both theory and<br />\npractice.

Students and<br />\nelderly residents of the<br />\nHomewood area have recently<br />\nbeen feeling the effects of this<br />\nsituation.<br />\nArea landlords have relied on<br />\nsection C of the ordinance, a<br />\ndisclaimer which entitles them to<br />\nadd to the permissible 6 percent<br />\nhike \"the proportionate share of<br />\nthe amount of any increases in<br />\ncosts to the landlord for the<br />\npremises..,resulting from<br />\nincreases in real estate taxes,<br />\nwater and sewage charges, utility<br />\nrates, and heating fuel charges.\"<br />\nThe disclaimer requires, though,<br />\nthat landlords demonstrate in<br />\nwriting the basis for any<br />\nproportionate increase beyond 6<br />\n<br />\nper cent.<br />\nBut many tenants have found<br />\nit very difficult to contest<br />\nunlawful rent hikes for a variety<br />\nof reasons. First of all, the State<br />\nAttorney General's office is no<br />\nlonger charged with enforcing<br />\nrent control legislation, leaving<br />\nBaltimore City agencies to bear<br />\nthe full brunt of enforcement.<br />\nSince state-wide rent control<br />\nwas cancelled by the state<br />\nlegislature last year, rent control<br />\nlaws have been passed only on a<br />\ncity-wide basis in Maryland.<br />\nAttorney General Francis Burch<br />\ncomplained publicly last year of<br />\nhis office's inability to handle the<br />\nmassive number of rent control<br />\nappeals.

And to be sure<br />\nthere is no shortage of other less risky and more important<br />\nareas in which money could be invested.<br />\nThough there are some students who feel more strongly<br />\nabout the priority of housing, we do not consider it a<br />\npre-eminent concern.

In addition, the shortage of<br />\non-campus living space has the curious benefit of imposing on<br />\nstudents the valuable education that accompanies living in<br />\nthe city on one's own.<br />\nWith the Library and other academic and administrative<br />\ndepartments sorely in need of funds, the huge investment<br />\nwhich could result from the administration's investigation of<br />\nhousing resources would be an ill-advised venture, especially<br />\nsince there are other methods of ameliorating the Hopkins<br />\nhousing dilemma.<br />\n<br />\nsuch as<br />\nBefore the University proceeds and invests in additional<br />\nHousing, it would be wise to first consider utilizing privately<br />\nowned housing in the Homewood area to its fullest extent.<br />\nThe appointment of Belva Scott as Coordinator of<br />\noff-campus housing is clearly a commendable step in that<br />\ndirection.<br />\nHowever, as Scott stated yesterday, there is little that the<br />\nhousing office can do in dealing with landlords other than talk<br />\nto them. But, if the University, for example, would place its<br />\nconsiderable influence behind those students who are having<br />\ndifficulty with area landlords, or even better, if it would<br />\nprovide a certain amount of legal assistance for students being<br />\nintimidated by their landlords, student satisfaction with<br />\ncommunity housing will undoubtedly improve.

The leaders of the<br />\nparty pointed out to the mayor<br />\nand city council of Baltimore<br />\nthat it would not be appropriate<br />\nfor the party opposing the<br />\nexpansion of slavery\u2014and<br />\ncomposed of ex-Northern Whigs,<br />\nFree Soilers, and even some<br />\nAbolitionists\u2014to hold its<br />\nconclave in a city so one-sidedly<br />\npro-slavery, pro-South, and<br />\npro-secession as Baltimore. The<br />\ncity fathers could not follow this<br />\nline of reasoning; they had no<br />\nregard for principles and wanted<br />\nthe convention in Baltimore for<br />\nthe money it would bring in.<br />\n\"Wait til '64 and submit your<br />\nproposal again,\" party leader<br />\nWilliam Henry Seward told them.<br />\nBut anti-Republican sentiments<br />\ncontinued to roll and rankle in<br />\nthe Monumental City.

The governor of<br />\nMaryland, a moderate named<br />\nThomas Holliday Hicks, decided<br />\nthat he did not want his state to<br />\n<br />\nbecome an abattoir; he prevented<br />\nthe state from seceding from the<br />\nUnion.

So, I really wanted to see<br />\nwhat I would be like as a<br />\n\"shitworker\" and it wasn't'easy.<br />\nThere was also a professional<br />\nconsideration. Hopkins is a<br />\nstrictly \"publish or perish\"<br />\nschool. So I decided I was going<br />\nto write about something I<br />\nconsidered to be politically<br />\nimportant...I decided that I was<br />\ngoing to write a book about<br />\nworking for capitalism, with<br />\nsome comparisons to the Chinese<br />\nsystem.

I am not an<br />\nexpert--I simply know some<br />\nthings about what I did, and I<br />\nknow it a little differently than<br />\nthe people who do it all their<br />\nlives.<br />\n<br />\nIt was very real for me; it was<br />\nno game. I was deeply involved in<br />\nthe work...I mean in all aspects. I<br />\nwas involved in doing a<br />\ncompetent job, which I found<br />\nvery difficult at first. There was<br />\nalways an incredible amount of<br />\npressure and sense of<br />\nresponsibility...which most<br />\npeople don't think of in terms of<br />\na factory. This job certainly did<br />\ninvolve it.\"<br />\nN-L: Did your background and<br />\nacademic training, in any way<br />\nhelp or hinder you in the<br />\nperformance of your tasks, and<br />\nin your interaction with your<br />\nfellow workers?<br />\nPfeffer: Nobody in the factory<br />\nknew who I was, least of all the<br />\npersonnel department. I had a<br />\ndummy work record which I<br />\nturned in. I never would have<br />\ngotten the job otherwise, and I<br />\nnever could have held the job<br />\notherwise. But that background<br />\nhad certain liabilities, because I'd<br />\nmissed out on twenty-five years<br />\nof working class experience...I<br />\nknew not a thing about<br />\nmachines.<br />\nN-L: Didn't you feel<br />\nawkward?<br />\nPfeffer: Absolutely! I mean I<br />\njust didn't know enough about<br />\nmachines, things that most<br />\nworking class kids assimilate in<br />\nthe very context of their<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nIn terms of relating with my<br />\nfellow workers, I really don't<br />\nthink it was a hindrance at<br />\nwas at least as at home with the<br />\n<br />\npeople I worked with there as I<br />\nhave been with any other people<br />\nI've worked with. They have few<br />\n. tnem<br />\npretensions, and after you get to<br />\nknow tham they're pretty<br />\nstraight-out people. There is<br />\nmore of a sense of camaraderie<br />\nand collectivity in the factory<br />\nthan there is here at the<br />\nUniveristy.<br />\nN-L: Were you ever tempted<br />\nto abandon the project?<br />\nPfeffer: Oh yeah! But<br />\nremember I had several<br />\nimpulsions to keep me there. One<br />\nwas to prove it to myself. Also, I<br />\nhave a book to write. But<br />\nsometimes I got deeply depressed<br />\nabout the objective situation,<br />\nabout things that I was doing or<br />\nfeeling, about problems I had<br />\nwith fellow workers...there's a lot<br />\nto get depressed about.<br />\nNevetheless, the experience was<br />\nvery important and real.

As I<br />\nbegan to press for no work on<br />\nSaturdays, tensions grew until we<br />\nfinally had a blowup, and tried to<br />\ncut my other overtime. Now, for<br />\na foreman that's a lethal weapon,<br />\nbecause he knows that the<br />\nfactory workers depend on<br />\novertime. For me, the money was<br />\nuseful, but I wasn't as dependent<br />\non it as were the regular workers.<br />\nHowever, I wasn't at all sure that<br />\nI could do my job, without my<br />\nmorning hours, which were the<br />\nbest for working. But since we'd<br />\njust signed a new contract, I had<br />\nthe right not to work on<br />\nSaturdays, and he did not have<br />\nthe right to cut off my other<br />\novertime. Ironically, three weeks<br />\nlater my small victory turned out<br />\nto be pyrrhic, as the company<br />\ncut off all overtime in the plant.<br />\nN-L: Did the working<br />\nexperience in any way alter your<br />\npersonal and/or political views?<br />\nPfeffer: On one hand I<br />\nconfirmed on an emotional and<br />\nconcrete level, what I had only<br />\nsuspected intellectually: that<br />\ncapitalism is the basic cause of<br />\nmost of the evils of American<br />\nsociety. In other words, I went<br />\ninto the factory as someone who<br />\nwas intellectually leaning toward<br />\nMarxism, and the factory<br />\nexperience was tremendously<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nconfirmatory. It also told me<br />\nsomething about the University<br />\nthat I didn'tl previously<br />\nunderstand. It's much easier to<br />\nsee things in a factory than at the<br />\nUniversity. In a liberal capitalist<br />\nsociety, a lot of the mechanisms<br />\nof manipulation in the more<br />\nsophisticated environs of a<br />\nuniversity are disguised. In a<br />\nfactory, man, they are right out<br />\nthere pounding on you every<br />\nday! It is very clear in the factory<br />\nthat workers are commodities\u2014<br />\nthat they're bought and sold and<br />\nthat their time is basically not<br />\ntheir own. The system is.<br />\nconcerned with production and<br />\nnot with people's lives. Not at all<br />\nconcerned with people's lives!<br />\nIt's not the fault of the people<br />\nwho man the posts within the<br />\nsystem itself. The system's there<br />\nto bring profit to one class of<br />\npeople, largely at the expense of<br />\n<br />\nRichard M. Pfeffer<br />\n<br />\nthe leadership of the labor union<br />\nwas somewhere between \"them\"<br />\nand \"us\"...closer to \"them\" than<br />\n\"us.\"<br />\nI also learned, although I am<br />\nnot sure how well I learned this,<br />\nhow important patience is. You<br />\ndon't get political change in this<br />\ncountry fast...you have to be in<br />\ntouch with how the masses of<br />\npeople feel and see the system.<br />\nI learned, too, that I am as<br />\nmuch a worker here at the<br />\nuniversity as I was in the factory.<br />\nThe standards of production<br />\ndiffer: here it's how many books<br />\nor papers I put out, while there it<br />\nwas how many trash hoppers I<br />\ncould empty. I recognize now<br />\nhow much of a commodity I am<br />\nat the University, just as I was in<br />\nthe factory. But I hadn't seen it<br />\nlike that before.<br />\nN-L: According to the Marxist<br />\nunderstanding, the revolution<br />\nwill not occur until the masses or<br />\nworkers have become so fed up<br />\nwith their exploitation at the<br />\nhands of the capitalists that they<br />\nrise up to destroy the system.<br />\nHow fed up, in your judgment, is<br />\nthe American worker with his<br />\nposition in the present economic<br />\nscheme?<br />\nPfeffer: It's hard to say. There<br />\nare a lot of workers who feel<br />\ndefeated, and basically what they<br />\ntry to do is separate their work<br />\nlives from their outside lives. The<br />\ngoal of the worker is to get out<br />\nof that goddam factory as fast as<br />\npossible, once he's put in his<br />\novertime to get enough money.<br />\n<br />\nThen to go home and, it he's got<br />\npeople and the workers. As we<br />\nthe energy left, to buy, to be lose our position as the leading<br />\nwith his family, to watch imperialist power, we'll lose the<br />\ntelevision, to booze it up, to economic benefits of that<br />\nforget about all the antagonisms position.

And I would<br />\nsay that, so far, the strategy has \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nsucceeded...in no small part \u2022<br />\nOver 35 years<br />\n\u2022<br />\nof experience<br />\n\u2022<br />\nbecause of American imperialism. \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nand success<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBecause, so far, American \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nSmall classes<br />\n\u2022<br />\nimperialism has been relatively \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nsuccessful for the working class. \u2022<br />\nVoluminous home!<br />\nstudy materials ;<br />\nBut now that American \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nimperialism is in serious trouble, \u2022<br />\n,Courses that are \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe working class is starting to \u2022<br />\nconstantly updated \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nget cut real hard.

The<br />\nPossibility of purchasing an<br />\napartment building off-campus<br />\nand of building new dormitories<br />\non campus will be investigated.<br />\nAll administrators involved<br />\nWith the Housing investigation<br />\nwho were interviewed yesterday<br />\nsaid they believe there is a<br />\ndefinite need for housing.<br />\n\"I'm convinced that there's a<br />\nneed,\" stated Dean of Students<br />\nJakie Hall. \"I'm shaky, though,<br />\non just what that need is.\"<br />\n\"There's no question<br />\nadditional housing is needed,\"<br />\nsaid Ross Jones, Vice President<br />\nfor University Affairs. \u2014The<br />\nquestion is what the numbers<br />\nare.\"<br />\nThe examination of the<br /><br />\nhousing situation was a result of<br />\nseveral stimuli, according to Hall.<br />\nLast year's Housing Report by<br />\nthe Student Council, complaints<br />\nand concerns voiced t?Sy present<br />\nstudents and concerns of possible<br />\nfuture students and their pareqts<br />\nconvinced President Muller tha't,<br />\nin his words, \"we really ought tc<br />\ngive this a full-dress thorough<br />\nreview.\"<br />\nThe decision to examine the<br />\npossibility of acquiring more<br />\nhousing represents a shift in the<br />\nUniversity's attitude towards the<br />\nsituation. In the past few years,<br />\nadministrators have held to the<br />\nposition that housing in the<br />\ncommunity would sufficiently<br />\nsupplement University-owned<br />\nhousing.<br />\nHowever, serious difficulties<br />\nwould arise in implementing<br />\neither housing option.<br />\nMuller asserted that the cost of<br />\nbuilding new housing is<br />\nprohibitive. The University<br />\nwould not be able to amortize<br />\nthe cost of the construction<br />\nthrough .rents comparable to<br />\nthose charged now.<br />\nBuilding new residences would<br />\nmean either raising rents<br />\ndfastically, or having the<br />\nUniversity subsidize housing, a<br />\ndeviation from its present policy.<br />\nBut buying an apartment<br />\nbuilding off-campus would meet<br />\nwith serious opposition from the<br />\nHomewood community, Jones<br /><br />\nacknowledged!.<br />\nSaid Jones, \"We're- sensitive to<br />\nthe problem of disrupting<br />\npeople's lives who are already in<br />\nthese places.\"<br />\nan immediate measure to<br />\nrelieve the Housing problems for<br />\nHopkins students, the Uuiversity<br />\nappointed Belva Scat* to the<br />\nne'vv.1 Y-created tiosition of<br />\nC4-oidinator of Off-Campus<br />\nHousing.<br />\nHall asserted that Scott will be<br />\nable to help assess.the availability<br />\nof off-campus housing.<br />\nScott stated<br />\nthat the<br />\nUniversity is going to have a hard<br />\ntime finding a suitable apartment<br />\nfor use. Opposition to University<br /><br />\nexpansion into the community<br />\nwas evident last spring as the<br />\nGreater Homewood Community<br />\nCorporation protested strongly<br />\nHopkins' purchase of the<br />\nGladwyn Manor at 3201 N.<br />\nCharles for office space.<br />\nScott said that the major<br />\nproblem thus far has not been a<br />\nlack of housing but a lack of<br />\ngood housing that satisfies the<br />\nstudent resident.<br />\nAnother major housing<br />\nproblem is unscrupulous<br />\nlandlords who take advantage of<br />\nstudents, she said. \"We hope to<br />\nbe able to warn students about<br />\nthe bad landlords,'' she<br />\ncontinued.<br /><br />\nHonor Code alternative in sight<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nWithin a month the University<br />\nshould at last have a viable<br />\nalternative to the Honor Code<br />\nwhich .was maintained for 67<br />\nyears before its termination by<br />\nstudent referendum last April.<br />\nThe Code will be replaced by a<br />\nloosely-structured proctoring<br />\nsystem formulated by a special<br />\nStudent Council committee and<br />\napproved by the student body.<br />\nPending its approval by the<br />\nAcademic Council and the<br />\nStudent Council later this month,<br /><br />\nthis document will become the<br />\nofficial University governance<br />\nsystem for academic offenses,<br />\nreplacing what Dean of Academic<br />\nPrograms Sigmund Suskind calls<br />\n\"the present non-system.\"<br />\nA task force of faculty and<br />\nstudents worked on the proposal<br />\nlast summer, making minor<br />\nrevisions on the recommendation<br />\nof the Academic Council.

And to be sure<br />\nthere is no shortage of other less risky and more important<br />\nareas in which money could be invested.<br />\nThough there are some students who feel more strongly<br />\nabout the priority of housing, we do not consider it a<br />\npre-eminent concern. We encourage the University to explore<br />\nall possible methods of improving the lot of the student<br />\nhousing-wise, but feel that the construction of on-campus<br />\nhousing entails enormous risks\u2014student enrollments and<br />\npreferences cannot be predicted accurately enough to justify<br />\nsuch a long-term undertaking. In addition, the shortage of<br />\non-campus living space has the curious benefit of imposing on<br />\nstudents the valuable education that accompanies living in<br />\nthe city on one's own.<br />\nWith the Library and other academic and administrative<br />\ndepartments sorely in need of funds, the huge investment<br />\nwhich could result from the administration's investigation of<br />\nhousing resources would be an ill-advised venture, especially<br />\nsince there are other methods of ameliorating the Hopkins<br />\nhousing dilemma.<br /><br />\nsuch as<br />\nBefore the University proceeds and invests in additional<br />\nHousing, it would be wise to first consider utilizing privately<br />\nowned housing in the Homewood area to its fullest extent.<br />\nThe appointment of Belva Scott as Coordinator of<br />\noff-campus housing is clearly a commendable step in that<br />\ndirection.<br />\nHowever, as Scott stated yesterday, there is little that the<br />\nhousing office can do in dealing with landlords other than talk<br />\nto them. But, if the University, for example, would place its<br />\nconsiderable influence behind those students who are having<br />\ndifficulty with area landlords, or even better, if it would<br />\nprovide a certain amount of legal assistance for students being<br />\nintimidated by their landlords, student satisfaction with<br />\ncommunity housing will undoubtedly improve. And at the<br />\nsame time, the University would be fulfilling its obligation to<br />\ncombat discriminatory housing practices\u2014one of the<br />\njustifications for .the, University's acquisition of additional<br />\nhousing. If students are denied good housing because they are<br />\nwomen, black, or simply students, the reaction should not be<br />\nto return to the cloister of the University, but to work, and if<br />\nnecessary, fight for the right to live in the community.<br />\nAt a time when money is tight, future enrollments<br />\nsomewhat unpredictable, and social change as desirable as it<br />\never was, such a solution makes good sense. Perhaps the<br />\nindividual cannot change leasing practices in the Homewood<br />\narea, but it seems likely that the University as agents for<br />\nthousands could.<br /><br />\nJourney through the past-part II<br />\nBy KEN SOKOLOW<br />\nIn the summer of 1860, the<br />\nupstart Republican party held its<br />\nnational convention in Chicago<br />\nand nominated Abraham Lincoln<br />\nfor President\u2014above the protests<br />\nof the city fathers of Baltimore.<br />\nwho had agitated for the<br />\nconvention to be held here in<br />\nMobtown. The leaders of the<br />\nparty pointed out to the mayor<br />\nand city council of Baltimore<br />\nthat it would not be appropriate<br />\nfor the party opposing the<br />\nexpansion of slavery\u2014and<br />\ncomposed of ex-Northern Whigs,<br />\nFree Soilers, and even some<br />\nAbolitionists\u2014to hold its<br />\nconclave in a city so one-sidedly<br />\npro-slavery, pro-South, and<br />\npro-secession as Baltimore. The<br />\ncity fathers could not follow this<br />\nline of reasoning; they had no<br />\nregard for principles and wanted<br />\nthe convention in Baltimore for<br />\nthe money it would bring in.<br />\n\"Wait til '64 and submit your<br />\nproposal again,\" party leader<br />\nWilliam Henry Seward told them.<br />\nBut anti-Republican sentiments<br />\ncontinued to roll and rankle in<br />\nthe Monumental City. When<br />\nLincoln passed through town on<br />\nhis way to inauguration in<br />\nWashington, he narrowly escaped<br />\nassassination.<br />\nGetting Our Licks In<br />\nThe first blood of the Civil<br />\nWar was not shed at Bull Run,<br />\nbut on Pratt Street in Baltimore.<br />\nShortly after the fiasco at Ft.<br />\nSumter, President Lincoln<br />\nordered Federal troops sent to<br />\nWashington to protect the capital<br />\nagainst attack from the seceded<br />\nVirginia and the (as it was then<br />\nthought) soon -to -secede<br />\nMaryland. The First<br />\nMassachusetts Regiment, on its<br />\nway to Washington, had to<br />\nchange trains in Baltimore.<br />\nMarching down Pratt Street<br />\ntoward the President Street<br />\nStation, the New Englanders<br />\nwere attacked by a<br />\nstone-throwing, club-carrying<br />\nmob of pro-Southern hooligans<br />\nwho had met at the Shot Tower,<br />\na popular local bar, to plan their<br />\nriot. There were fatalities on<br />\nboth sides.<br />\nDamyankees<br />\nSoon after this incident, the<br />\nstate of Maryland found itself<br />\nunder Northern military<br />\noccupation. The governor of<br />\nMaryland, a moderate named<br />\nThomas Holliday Hicks, decided<br />\nthat he did not want his state to<br /><br />\nbecome an abattoir; he prevented<br />\nthe state from seceding from the<br />\nUnion. This did not satisfy<br />\nPresident Lincoln, who,<br />\nsuspending the writ of habeas<br />\ncorpus, had the mayor, chief of<br />\npolice, and the city council of<br />\nBaltimore seized and thrown into<br />\nthe dungeons of Ft. McHenry<br />\n(where the flag Francis Scott Key<br />\ndidn't really see wasn't flying<br />\nback in 1814). As if this violation<br />\nof American citizens' legal rights<br />\nwasn't enough, the President<br />\nordered cannons placed atop<br />\nFederal Hill, directly across the<br />\nInner Harbor from the central<br />\nbusiness district of Baltimore; the<br />\nYankees were ready to level the<br />\ncity to the ground should the<br />\nConfederate sympathizers cause<br />\ntoo much ,trouble. Baltimore<br />\ncooled its heels\u2014the ones who<br />\nwere not thrown in jail<br />\nalready\u2014and escaped destruction<br />\nat the hands of the Damyankees.<br />\nAs a result of the need for the<br />\ngovernor of Maryland to control<br />\nlaw enforcement in turbulant<br />\nBaltimore, the police chief(now<br />\ncalled the police commissioner)<br />\nof the city has been appointed by<br />\nthe governor\u2014not the<br />\nmayor\u2014since the Civil War. This<br />\nbone of contention has been<br />\ngnawed upon in many mayoralty<br />\ncampaigns; local candidates are<br />\nalways promising \"to get back<br />\ncontrol of our police force from<br />\nthe tyrants in Annapolis\", to no<br />\navail.<br />\nLocal Boy Makes Good<br />\nPresident Lincoln was<br />\nmagnanimous and Baltimore<br />\nmerchants were hurting, so<br />\nfences were mended and the<br />\nRepublican national convention<br />\nwas held in Baltimore in 1864.<br />\nThis convention was notable for<br />\ntwo things: Hannibal Hamlin of<br />\nMaine was dropped as<br />\nvice-presidential nominee and<br />\nBaltimore actor John Wilkes<br />\nBooth failed in his bid to deliver<br />\nthe keynote speech to the<br />\nconvention.<br />\nBooth, who had been a rabid<br />\nConfederate supporter, became<br />\nconvinced by the summer of<br />\n1864 that the Southern cause<br />\nwas a lost one. Newly converted<br />\nto a spirit of charity toward the<br />\nDamyankees, Booth tried to<br />\napproach President Lincoln and<br />\ndiscuss his plans for \"binding up<br />\nthe nation's wounds.\" It is ironic<br />\nthat Booth and the man he was<br />\nto assassinate were not too far<br />\napart on the major issues of the<br /><br />\n'PILLS!!! WE WANT TO AMPUTATE!'<br /><br />\nday.<br />\nCrisis of the Self-Made Ham.<br />\nPresident Lincoln favored<br />\n\"repatriation\" of ex-slaves to<br />\nAfrica out of a conviction that<br />\nthe white majority would never<br />\naccept them as equal citizens.<br />\nThe Booth \"compromise plan,\"<br />\nbased on the same assumption,<br />\nwould have kept slavery as a legal<br />\ninstitution but would have<br />\nlimited the work week for slaves<br />\nto five days with the provision<br />\nthat the slaves take advantage of<br />\none of their days off to attend,<br />\nSaturday matinees at theaters to<br />\nbe managed by Mr. Booth in his<br />\nnew role as Secretary of<br />\nDiversion, a Cabinet-level job. At<br />\nany rate, Booth was not allowed<br />\nin to see the President at the<br />\nWhite House and was thrown out<br />\nof the convention in Baltimore<br />\nwith the assurance of the<br />\nmarshals that the President<br />\nwould read the copy of the<br />\nspeech J.W. had submitted for<br />\npossible presentation to the<br />\ndelegates.<br />\nNow it must be understood<br />\nthat Abe Lincoln was an<br />\ninveterate plagiarist who, by this<br />\nstage in his career, was running<br />\nout of material to steal. He had<br />\nalready exhausted the Bible,<br />\nShakespeare, Milton, and Joe<br />\nMiller's Jests, so he jumped at the<br />\nchance to use John Wilkes<br />\nBooth's prepared text. \"With<br />\nmalice toward none, with charity<br />\nfor all,\" Booth had written.

In other words, I went<br />\ninto the factory as someone who<br />\nwas intellectually leaning toward<br />\nMarxism, and the factory<br />\nexperience was tremendously<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nconfirmatory. It also told me<br />\nsomething about the University<br />\nthat I didn'tl previously<br />\nunderstand. It's much easier to<br />\nsee things in a factory than at the<br />\nUniversity. In a liberal capitalist<br />\nsociety, a lot of the mechanisms<br />\nof manipulation in the more<br />\nsophisticated environs of a<br />\nuniversity are disguised. In a<br />\nfactory, man, they are right out<br />\nthere pounding on you every<br />\nday! It is very clear in the factory<br />\nthat workers are commodities\u2014<br />\nthat they're bought and sold and<br />\nthat their time is basically not<br />\ntheir own. The system is.<br />\nconcerned with production and<br />\nnot with people's lives. Not at all<br />\nconcerned with people's lives!<br />\nIt's not the fault of the people<br />\nwho man the posts within the<br />\nsystem itself.

There<br />\nare a lot of workers who feel<br />\ndefeated, and basically what they<br />\ntry to do is separate their work<br />\nlives from their outside lives. The<br />\ngoal of the worker is to get out<br />\nof that goddam factory as fast as<br />\npossible, once he's put in his<br />\novertime to get enough money.<br /><br />\nThen to go home and, it he's got<br />\npeople and the workers.
