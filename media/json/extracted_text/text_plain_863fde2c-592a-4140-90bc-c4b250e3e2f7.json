We firmly believe that the election in all<br />\nprobability has not been influenced<br />\nby the breaking of that law. We<br />\nSuspect that the second election<br />\nwhich we have ruled will take<br />\nplace wilt be influenced to some<br />\nextent by the inescapable fact<br />\nthat, despite the extreme caution<br />\nwe have exercised, at least a general knowledge of the results of<br />\nthe invalidated election has spread<br />\nover the campus. We fear that<br />\nthis knowledge will tend to bias<br />\nthe votes of voters in the second<br />\nelection.<br />\n\"However, we are forced to our<br />\ndecision by the realization that<br />\nwhat we \"believe\" and what we<br />\n\"suspect\" and we \"fear\" cannot,<br />\nmust not influence our ruling.<br />\nThe Student Council and its committees cannot base its judgments<br />\non assumptions. It must base its<br />\njudgments, instead, on the legislation it has passed. Although<br />\nit is entirely possible in this individual case that the intent behind the law\u2014the avoidance of<br />\nvoting results getting out to the<br />\nvoting public before the final<br />\nballots are cast\u2014 has remained<br />\nUnbroken, our only recourse is to<br />\nback up laws which were made<br />\nby the Council for the specific<br />\npurpose of insuring the sanctity<br />\nof the elections. Although our<br />\nruling may result in a less fair<br />\nelection than the first election,<br />\nwe must stick to the principles<br />\nthat we set up originally to govern the balloting. Assumptions<br />\nare dangerous. The super-structure of the law, which provides<br />\nfor the continuing existence of the<br />\nStudent Council, must be upheld,<br />\nalthough in a few isolated instances upholding it may yield<br />\nunfortunate results. If the superstructure is to be evaded and<br />\nskirted around, it is likely that it<br />\nwill collapse.<br />\nDissenting Vote<br />\nPeinado, who cast the dissenting<br /><br />\nvote, explained his actions and<br />\nhis voting position in the following manner:<br />\n\"A law of the Council was<br />\nbroken by my counting the votes<br />\n(with my roommate), ahead of<br />\nthe prescribed time. Before counting the votes, I did consider the<br />\nruling of the Council, but I felt<br />\nthat I was not doing wrong because I knew that neither I nor<br />\nmy roommate would spread the<br />\nresults and by so doing influence<br />\nthe election.<br />\n\"I cast the dissenting vote in<br />\nthe Committee after evaluating<br />\ntwo points: one, the legality of my<br />\naction; two, my feeling that the<br />\nfirst election would be more representative of the true, unbiased<br />\nopinions of the voters than any<br />\nother, following election possibly<br />\ncould be. I felt strongly that the<br />\nimportance of the second point<br />\nover-rode the technical illegality<br />\nof my actions.<br /><br />\nInfluence<br />\n\"In the first election, there was<br />\nno influence of the election because of pre-knowledge of the<br />\nresults of the first day's voting,<br />\nwhile the second election will be<br />\ninfluenced by a wide-spread cog-<br /><br />\nSCALION'S RUN INN<br />\nCOFFEE SHOP<br /><br />\nEarl Baker, running unopposed<br />\nfor secretary drew 154 votes.
