In<br />\nan era full of tussles over issues like nuclear energy.<br />\nchemical warfare, space programs and supersonic air<br />\ntransport, a new controversy has come out of the<br />\nlaboratory and started to break at local government<br />\nlevels, in the press, and on university grounds.<br />\nThis one is variously called \"recombinant DNA<br />\nresearch,\" \"gene- splicing,\" and \"genetic engineering.'<br />\nAll the terms refer to a basic concept of joining DNA<br />\nfragments -- the material that constitues genes an<br />\nprovides' the hereditary information for all life forms \u2014of<br />\none organism to the genes of a carrier (such as a virus o<br />\nplasmid). This recombinant \"vector\" is then introduce(<br />\ninto the cells of another organism, where it may grow a:<br />\nan \"adopted\" gene. Current research mostly involves thl<br />\ntransfer of animal or plant genes to host bacteria cells.<br />\nBy using recombinant techniques, scientists lool<br />\nforward to tremendous benefits, while critics envisioi<br />\ndangerous scenarios. The debate, though, has a few<br />\nunusual features. The battlelines are not clearly drawn: a<br />\nnumber of leading biologists are strongly opposed to the<br />\ncurrent research, while others committed to<br />\nenvironmental safety in many areas welcome the new<br />\nOpportunities. And the guidelines and safeguards now in<br />\neffect for recombinant work came from within the<br />\nscientific community, before the research had begun in<br />\nearnest,<br />\nIn July 1973, at the Gordon Research Conference on<br />\nNucleic Acids, scientists recognized the potential hazards<br />\nof the new gene-splicing techniques and sent letters to<br />\nthe National Academy of Science, prompting the NAS to<br />\nset up a review committee and call for a moratorium on<br />\nexperiments pending investigation. An international<br />\nconference was also proposed, and in February 1975,<br />\n150 people gathered at the Asilomar Conference Center\"<br />\nin Pacific Grove, California, to discuss genetic<br />\nengineering and possible ways to deal with its risks.<br />\nThe report from Asilomar spurred a series of three<br />\nmeetings of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)<br />\nRecombinant Advisory Committee in 1975. The Director<br />\nof NIH, Donald Frederickson, then worked with his own<br />\nadvisory committee, going over specific guidelines drawn<br />\ntogether from the three separate meetings. Finally, in<br />\nJuly 1976, the NW issued its settled-on guidelines to<br />\nreplace the recommendations of the Asilomar<br />\nConference.<br />\nSo within three years, scientists had realized the risks<br />\nof their new research and had taken it upon themselves<br />\nto create a set of guidelines to regulate the work about to<br />\nbe done. This self-policing, before recombinant research<br />\nwent full ahead, is justly referred to as a foresightful act<br />\nof responsibility; ironically, it has also drawn the valid<br />\ncharge that \"the Committee authorized to write the<br />\nGuidelines consisted primarily of scientists interested in<br />\ndoing this research.\" That quote comes from Science for<br />\nthe People, a Boston-based group which includes some<br />\nprominent biology professors among its members. They<br />\nAn d other critics contend that the NIH Recombinant<br />\nAdvisory Committee -- with but one non-science advisor<br />\nrepresents a conflict of interest, asking the incendiaries<br />\nto put out the fire.<br />\nIn the introductiOn to the NIH guidelines,<br />\nFrederickson stated: \"Recombinant DNA research brings<br />\nto the fore certain problems in 'addressing the potential<br />\nimpact of basic science on society as a whole, including<br />\nthe manner of providing public participation in those<br />\nassessments,...lt is not surprising that scientists in other<br />\nfields and the general public have difficulty in<br />\nunderstanding advances in recombinant DNA research.<br />\nYet public awareness and understanding of this line of<br />\ninvestigation is vital.\" Last year, \"public participation\"<br />\nwas carried out in a heated manner in Cambridge. The<br />\nCity Council, after finding out about some planned<br />\nhigher-level risk experiments to be done at Harvard and<br />\nMIT, voted a \"good faith\" (since their action had no<br />\nforce of law) three-month moratorium on the reserach. A<br />\nreview board was established; last month, it gave the<br />\ngo-ahead to lower-level experiments.<br />\n<br />\nThe public hearings and council actions in Cambridge<br />\npolitical<br />\nbrought out dissension in faculty ranks,<br />\nopportunism on the part of some council members, and<br />\ncommunity backlash against the two schools. Dr. Robert<br />\nDot tin, a biology professor at Hopkins who had<br />\npreviously been at MIT, recalled that \"the experiments<br />\nwere frightening to some people. There were not<br />\nwell-regulated facilifies...I think that in Harvard's case<br />\nthere was reason to be concerned.\" He also noted that<br />\npeople around Harvard and MIT are \"concerned about<br />\nhow much input the public has. They feel the science is<br />\ntoo dangerous to be left to scientists alone.\"<br />\nOther cities where universities have proposed or are<br />\ndoing recombinant DNA research have taken action,<br />\nthough not on the level of the Cambridge moratorium.<br />\nReview committees in San Diego and Ann Arbor (the<br />\nlatter an in-university affair) made recommendations<br />\nabout research at the local universities; public hearings<br />\nand panels in Bloomington and Princeton brought out<br />\noften tense discussion on the recombinant work.<br />\nMeanwhile, two states (California and New York) are<br />\nmoving toward some sort of legislation to regulate the<br />\ngene- splicing research. As states ponder bills, it is<br />\nsignificant to note that the NIH guidelines are just that -guidelines, not regulations. Within the academic<br />\ncommunity, researchers are under heavy pressure to<br />\nfollow the guidelines, since they are usually funded by<br />\nthe NIH. And, as Dr. Robert Ballantine of the Hopkins<br />\nBiology Department explains, \"you can't get published<br />\nunless you've followed the guidelines. If there was a<br />\nquestion of perjury, your name as a scientist would be<br />\nmud...glory doesn't come from headlines in the New<br />\nYork Times. It comes with the publication of journal<br />\narticles.\"<br />\nIndustry, however, also has a stake in genetic<br />\nengineering. Currently, there are seven major<br />\npharmaceutical companies involved in recombiant<br />\nresearch; they are well aware of the ,N11-1 guidelines, but<br />\nonly have to accept them voluntarily. The corporations<br />\nare hesitant about any federally- adopted regulations<br />\nparallel to the guidelines that would require approval of<br />\nall research plans since disclosure would wreck patent<br />\nopportunities. At present, then, much secrecy surrounds<br />\nthe industry's research, as writers for the People's<br />\nBusiness Commission discovered after contacting<br />\ncompany representatives.<br />\nWhat they did find was an Interagency Committee set<br />\nup by then- President Ford last September, responsible<br />\n\"to review federal policy on the conduct of research<br />\ninvolving the creation of new life forms.\" This<br />\ncommittee, under the supervision of NIH, has many<br />\nmembers with backgrounds in industry, another possible<br />\nconflict- of-interest arrangement. As the PBC reported in<br />\nMother Jones magzine, \"a significant faction of the<br />\nInteragency Committee is urging that federal guidelines<br />\non recombinant DNA research be made voluntary and<br />\nthat the industry be left to police itself. In the unlikely<br />\nevent that the committee takes a tougher stance and<br />\nrecommends, for instance, the creation of a new<br />\nsuper-agency with enough money and muscle to closely<br />\n<br />\npolice all NDA research, look for the inductrv to resist.\"<br />\nThe committee's report, originally due in January, now<br />\nappears scheduled for March as the earliest release date.<br />\nWhether industry will follow the present NIH<br />\nguidelines -- which \"should be mandatory for anyone<br />\ndoing research,\" according to Dr. Eric Weinberg of the<br />\nBiology Department -- remains to be seen. A recent<br />\nScience article reports that industry spokesmen have<br />\nindicated a desire for some government agency to follow<br />\ntheir research, if only to get out of the \"fishbowl\" of<br />\nsuspicion they are now in.<br />\nIf an agency does come to have some responsibility for<br />\nindustry action (the NIH the most likely prospect),<br />\nhowever, it faces the problem the old Atomic Energy<br />\nCommission had: it would be charged with regulating an<br />\nindustry that it promoted at the same time. Viewing the<br />\nred tape the nuclear industry now encounters from AEC<br />\nspin-offs, the pharmaceuticai companies would certainly<br />\nfight any attempts at a purely regulatory body that could<br />\nseverely delay their research. The industry, after all, is<br />\ninvolved in a competitive situation and threats to patents<br />\nand the research behind those patents would not be<br />\ntaken lightly.<br />\nBesides academic and industry research, there remains<br />\nthe question of possible defense work in recombinant<br />\nDNA research. Some scientists have cited the effective<br />\nfailure of the Army to produce any controllable<br />\nbiological weapons when they engaged in that research as<br />\na reassuring sign. The new gene-splicing techniques,<br />\nhowever, would seem an unhealthy tool for defense and<br />\nintelligence workers to have, given the record of their<br />\nrecent practices.<br />\nReturning to the subject of the NIH guidelines: while<br />\nacademic researchers observe them, the following of the<br />\nregulations does not imply satisfaction. A straw poll<br />\ntaken by the Federation of AMerican Scientists found<br />\n;4% of the biologists and 32% of those in other fields<br />\nbelieved the guidelines to be \"probably insufficiently<br />\ncautious.\" At the same time, many scientists find them<br />\ntoo stringent; as Brown comments, \"I call it strict when<br />\nyou must work on a harmless bacteria under conditions<br />\nthat are more strict than those for disease- causing<br />\nbacteria.\"<br />\nWith increasing publicity about recombinant DNA<br />\nresearch -- especially information that can be strongly<br />\nbiased on one side or plainly wrong -- the controversy<br />\nseems to be heading toward more difficult regions, rather<br />\nthan smoothing out and passing over. Again from<br />\nFrderickson's introduction to the NIH guidelines, \"Public<br />\nresponsibility weighs heavily in this genetic research<br />\narea...the responsibility of the scientists involved is as<br />\ninescapable as is their opportunity to beneficially enrich<br />\nour understanding.\"<br />\n<br />\nNext week -- Reconzbinant DNA research at<br />\nHopkins;accounts of the benefits, risks,and<br />\nguidelines ofgene-splicing; and more.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-letterifebruary 18, 1977<br />\n<br />\nAnderson's investigators talk:<br />\nBy MARC DUVOIS1N<br />\nHarvard Theologian Harvey<br />\nCox is fond of suggesting that the;<br />\nmedical and legal professions<br />\ndraw up strict ethical guidelines.<br />\nSuch an approach, however,<br />\nmight be better applied to the<br />\npractice of journalism, if<br />\nWednesday's address by two<br />\noperatives of the Jack<br />\nAnderson -Les Whitten news<br />\nempire is any indication.<br />\nJim Grady, a University of<br />\nMissouri journalism graduate, and<br />\nJulia Rose, a recent alumna of<br />\nHopkins' School for Advanced ,<br />\nInternational Relations, are two<br />\nof the dozen or so anonymous<br />\nsoot -gatherers who keep<br />\nAnderson's nationally syndicated<br />\n\"Washington Merry-Go-Roundfull of the stuff that brings<br />\nknaves to justice, titillates the<br />\nsuburban readerships, and<br />\noccasionally showers disrepute<br />\non those who least deserve it.<br />\nTo work for Anderson, both<br />\nagreed, is to be affiliated with a<br />\nrevered American institution.<br />\nDisgruntled<br />\ngovernment<br />\nfunctionaries with an axe to grind<br />\ncontact Anderson first.

This explicitly political play<br />\nis the story of the efforts of a<br />\nsmall, Chinese village (Long Bow)<br />\nto carry out the socialist<br />\nrevolution between 1945 and<br />\n1949. Fanshen was adapted from<br />\nWilliam Hinton's documentary<br />\nbook of the same name which,<br />\nby focusing on a single<br />\ncommunity, highlighted the<br />\nstruggle of the entire Chinese<br />\npeople to \"fanShen\" -- to stand<br />\nup, to throw off the landlord's<br />\nyoke and to create a new world.<br />\nAs Comment magazine said,<br />\n\"The play is, however, much<br />\nmore than an historic record of<br />\n<br />\nMore AIM programs<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nbeing exposed 'o serious political<br />\nand historical questions.<br />\nIn --fact, the Little Flags<br />\nTheatre Collective, which is<br />\npresenting the play, expressly<br />\ntries to blend a political message<br />\ninto .each of its productions.<br />\nAccording to Hanna Lessinger of<br />\nGuardian, the group \"can<br />\nproduce theatre which is at once<br />\nmoving, entertaining,<br />\n'professional' in its standards and<br />\npolitically committed,\" without<br />\nalienating the normal audience.<br />\nIn addition, Maxine Klein, the<br />\nplay's director, is nationally<br />\nknown for her abilities as a<br />\ndirector and playwright in<br />\ncombining vivid theatricality<br />\nwith political impact.

People's lives are<br />\nalways changing. We all grow<br />\nolder, pick up new interests,<br />\ndiscard old ones, and so on. But<br />\nin the context of Ms. Klein's<br />\nquote and of Fanshen, the notion<br />\nof changing people's lives implies<br />\nsomething much broader. It<br />\nimplies the extended meaning of<br />\nthe word fanshen - \"the creation<br />\nof a new productive base, new<br />\nsocial relationships, new forms of<br />\nself - government, new ways of<br />\nthinking ...\" In essence, then, it<br />\nimplies the complete<br />\ntransformation of the entire<br />\nsociety.<br />\nFanshen provides the Hopkins<br />\n.:ommunity with the rare chance<br />\no see good, entertaining,<br />\ndolitical theatre.

The negatives for the<br />\nfirst three weeks filming of his<br />\nfirst English language film,<br />\nCasanova, had been stolen along<br />\nwith a third of Pier Paolo<br />\nPasolini's \"Salo, or the 120 Days<br />\nof Sodom\" and Damiano<br />\nDamiani's \"A Genius, Two<br />\nAssociates and a Fool.\" Fellini<br />\nand his producer Alberto<br />\nGrimaldi estimated the value of<br />\nthe missing negatives to be in the<br />\nmillions. \"For me, the damage is<br />\nincalculable,\" Fellini told the<br />\npress. \"Not only would three<br />\nweeks of work be ruined if the<br />\nnegatives are not returned, but<br />\nthe entire planning of the film as<br />\nwell.\"_<br />\nThe undamaged negatives were<br />\nrecovered and production<br />\ncontinued. What, if anything,<br />\nhappened to his \"entire<br />\nplanning\"? The Casanova which<br />\npremiered last Friday at the<br />\nTowson theater is certainly not<br />\nlacking in visual brilliance\u2014<br />\nindeed nearly every sequence is<br />\nbeautifully photographed, but<br />\nthe accompanying history of<br />\nGiacomo Casanova, though<br />\ncertainly not beautiful\u2014and we<br />\nwouldn't expect it to be, isn't<br />\nbelievable either. The fault<br />\ndoesn't lie with actor Donald<br />\nSutherland so much as it does<br />\nwith director-screenwriter Fellini.<br />\nHe should've either strengthened<br />\nthe script, presented us with<br />\nempathetic characters and<br />\nsituations, or thrown the script<br />\naway and given us a succession of<br />\nstrikirg visual images.<br />\nFellini's rich pictures and<br />\nshallow plot are nearly<br />\nirresistable: one leans back, the<br />\ndreamlike images flow by, and,<br />\nenchanted with the sheer beauty<br />\none doesn't ask what it all means.<br />\nI can think of two possible<br />\ninterpretations. In the first we<br />\nhave a young Casanova, who<br />\nwhenever he is engaged in sexual<br />\ngymnastics is accompanied by a<br />\nmechanical, golden bird. The<br />\nconnection between the<br />\nmechanical movements of the<br />\nbird and the mechanical nature<br />\nof his own exploits is soor<br />\nobvious. His world is one with<br />\n\"undefined boundaries of<br />\namorous interest\" and he<br />\nmaintains a reputation<br />\nthroughout Europe for what<br />\nBurgess' Alex would call the old<br />\n\"in-out in -out.\" The sex is<br />\nfrenzied, often a contest, rarely<br />\nintimate. There are voyeurs,<br />\nconnoisseurs of the act, who<br />\nevaluate his performances.<br />\nNino Rota's music has a<br />\nmechanistic nature and contains<br />\nelements of the circus. It<br />\nenhances the image of Casanova<br />\nas a showman going through his<br />\nroutines. He performs, not just<br />\nfor his partner, but often for a<br />\ngroup. Sex for these people<br />\nseems to offer anything from<br />\npersonal physical satisfaction to<br />\nthe satisfaction of voyeuristic<br />\nimpulses, but tie idea that sex is<br />\nan expression of affection seems<br />\nforeign to them.<br />\n'Toward the end. an aged<br />\nCasanova. forsaken by Eros,<br />\ndecides to commit suicide rather<br />\n<br />\nthan live an impotent life. Ever<br />\nthe showman, he dresses in his<br />\nfinest clothes before walking into<br />\nthe Thames. He notices a giantess<br />\non shore, climbs out, and once<br />\nagain is immersed in an orgiastic<br />\nworld. He ends his days with a<br />\nmachine, a mechanical woman,<br />\nand when he makes love to her<br />\nwe conclude, naturally, that<br />\nlovemaking has become a rather<br />\ndesperate routine.<br />\nOn one level, the movie is no<br />\nmore that a succession of orgies<br />\nand Fellini is saying no more<br />\nthan that sexual license, while an<br />\nawful lot of fun, leads to no good<br />\nend. It's really the fantasy of a<br />\nCatholic schoolboy, an episodic<br />\nadventure in voyeurism on<br />\nFellini's part. Lascivious nuns,<br />\nthe erotic mysticism of the age,<br />\nand homosexual ballets are all<br />\nwonderfully naughty, and Fellini<br />\nallows us, vicariously, to share in<br />\nthe debauchery, giggle at these<br />\nextreme representations of our<br />\nown fantasies.<br />\nOur middle class repressions<br />\nare lifted, but a sense of guilt is<br />\ncatholic, because naughtiness,<br />\nhowever much fun it may by,<br />\nsimply isn't right. The old,<br />\nunhappy Casanova at the end of<br />\nthe film has gotten what he<br />\ndeserves. The audience has both<br />\nshared in his license and punished<br />\nhim for it.

Your services have been in great demand<br />\nlately as an interpreter of the Southern experience,<br />\nas someone who understands the South, isn't that<br />\nright?<br />\nDuckey: Tom, ah don't have to 'tend to unstan'<br />\nthe South. Ah am the South.<br />\nTom: I once worked in Savannah at a 500-watt<br />\nradio , station and I confess I came to like fried<br />\nchicken.<br />\nDuckey: That's dayum big of you, Tom.<br />\nTom: But no the kind of fried chicken they sell<br />\nup North.<br />\nDuckey: Cose not. It ain't the real thang.<br />\nTom: What is the real thing?<br />\nDuckey: Ali lived in Etlanna long nuf to know<br />\nthat Co-Cola is the real thang. Tom, ah thank ef you<br />\n- penned me down ali'd prolly say the greatest Suthun<br />\nconchabutions to whir-uld culchuh is fried chicken<br />\nand Co-Cola. But they is more conchabutions<br />\nbesides that even. They is my novels and my<br />\npoultry, they is the Marshall Tucker Band and<br />\nCharlie Daniels, they is the cullud music rum<br />\nNarlinz...<br />\nTom: Let's not forget ham and red gravy.

A lot of<br />\nour viewers might be concerned because your own<br />\npoetry - I should say the little I've read of it - I mean<br />\nit didn't have any rhyme scheme. you know?<br />\nDuckey: No. Tom, poultry don't hafta rahm.

Do you follow me?<br />\nDuckey: Assolutely, Torn. You mean Yankees<br />\nthank we stupid cose we all sound lahk kickuhs,<br />\neven ef we is Ph.

Hey hey hey,<br />\nDNA..<br />\n<br />\nhustle<br />\nLast week's conviction of Larry Flynt in a Columbus,<br />\nOhio court is another sign of the troubles the Suprem<br />\ne<br />\nCourt invited with its ruling on obscenity a few years<br />\nago.<br />\nFlynt was sentenced to seven to twenty-five years and fined<br />\n$1,000 for his actions as publisher of Hustler that led to the<br />\nmagazine finding its way into the hands of decent<br />\nColumbus citizens.<br />\nNow Hustler may have no more socially redeeming<br />\nfeatures than, say, the News-American, but the conviction<br />\nraises two disturbing points beyond the question of<br />\nobscenity. First, one of the charges against Flynt was<br />\nengaging in criminal conspiracy -- as publisher, he was<br />\nresponsible for the magazine's distribution -- and thus could<br />\nbe dragged into court from anywhere in the country. The<br />\nthreat of prosecuting any employee involved in<br />\na<br />\nnationally-distributed media offering (as happened<br />\nin<br />\nGeorgia with a bit .actor in Deep Throat) for the<br />\nlocal<br />\ncriminal activity is ludicrous, to say thc least.<br />\nThis goes along with the second problem, namely that<br />\nthe Supreme Court's decision to leave obscenity<br />\nto<br />\n\"community\" standards opened the door for<br />\nnarrow-minded case-hungry District Attorneys to haul in<br />\ntheir favorite objectionable person. Since community<br />\nstandards are just about whatqer the local DA decides<br />\nthem to be, the First Amendment is in for serious trouble<br />\nin<br />\nmany areas of the country.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing in response to an<br />\nad placed in the Friday edition of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nNews-Letter. I found this ad to<br />\nbe in extremely bad taste and<br />\noffensively sexist. If this<br />\nrepresents the attitude of the<br />\nBETA crowd perhaps it is best<br />\nthat they stay wherever they are<br />\nnow. I know that in the name of<br />\n\"freedom of the press\" we tend<br />\nto print anything requested,<br />\nhowever. I would hope that as<br />\nwomen in responsible positions<br />\n(and you do have such positions)<br />\nyou would lend some support to<br />\nelimination of sexist<br />\nadvertising by refusing such an<br />\nad.<br />\nI hope that in the future you<br />\nwill be a little more sensitive to<br />\nthat portion of your readers who<br />\naren't particularly interested in<br />\nhaving their bodies used as bait<br />\nfor encouraging others to have a<br />\ngood time.<br />\nLorinda Riddle<br />\nAdministrative Assist.<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editorr:<br />\nThe February 11th printing of<br />\nthe News-Letter contained an<br />\nadvertisement for the \"Betas'<br />\nCome Back Ball.\" It is unclear<br />\nwhere they were corning back<br />\nfrom, my guess would be a<br />\ngigantic ego trip. This crude<br />\ndisplay of unaesthetic body<br />\nportrayal proved a mockery of<br />\nfemale existence. The News-letter<br />\ntotally disregarded the insult that<br />\nthis ad paid its female reader.<br />\nThe intent of the advertisement<br />\nmay have been to communicate a<br />\nparty of some sort but instead of<br />\nadvertising the uplift of spirits it<br />\ncapitalized on the uplift of the<br />\nfemale breast. Until women and<br />\nother minorities are treated With<br />\nthe respect they are deserving of<br />\nour society will not move<br />\nforward.<br />\nNancy McLernon<br />\nSchool of Public Health<br />\nTo the Editor:,<br />\nHow's this for a letter?<br />\nEgg Roll Norton<br />\n<br />\nBy STEPHEN SMITH<br />\n\"Tail-Gunner Joe,\" the recent<br />\ntelevision film, was a<br />\nmuch-needed introduction to, or<br />\nreminder of, the anti-Communist<br />\nhysteria that was at large in this<br />\ncountry in the early Cold War<br />\nperiod. The film addressed itself<br />\nto the question: Why wasn't<br />\nMcCarthy stopped? In answering<br />\nthat question, though, the film<br />\nemphasized peripheral points,<br />\nand ultimately offered them as a<br />\nreal explanation, and did not ask<br />\nthe broader, related, and more<br />\nimportant question of why the<br />\nentire national<br />\nEstablishment---government,<br />\nbusiness, education,<br />\netc.---undertook or at least<br />\ntolerated an anti-Communist<br />\ncrusade at that point in history.<br />\nThis film had much to<br />\nrecommend it. First, while<br />\n\"McCarthyism\" has become part<br />\nof our political vocabulary, far<br />\ntoo few people have more than a<br />\nvague idea of what it means, or<br />\nof how the word originated. This<br />\nfilm will help to correct that. It<br />\ngave several concrete examples of<br />\nlives ruined by McCarthy's<br />\ninvestigations and by the climate<br />\nsurrounding those investigations.<br />\nThe film suggested McCarthy's<br />\nmotivations and the source of his<br />\ninfluence by showing his<br />\nconnections with certain<br />\nbusinesses, with the Catholic<br />\nChurch, and with crypto-Fascist<br />\nelements in this country. The<br />\nmakers of this film did not duck<br />\ntouchy issues, such as how<br />\nMcCarthy was tolerated by two<br />\nPresidents of the United States,<br />\nand how he was greatly<br />\npublicized by an uncritical press.<br />\nIn \"Tail-Gunner Joe,\" though,<br />\nit almost appears as if McCarthy<br />\nwere alone in this crusade. One<br />\nwonders not why he wasn't<br />\nstopped, but how he ever got<br />\nstarted. The impression is given<br />\nthat every respectable person<br />\ndisapproved of McCarthy, though<br />\nthey may have lacked the<br />\ncourage to attack him: Truman,<br />\nEisenhower, and McCarthy's<br />\nfellow Senators. McCarthy, in<br />\nthis film, was a pathetic<br />\n<br />\nMacNelly<br />\n<br />\nfigure\u2014none too bright,<br />\nalcoholic, unprincipled, corrupt,<br />\nand paranoid\u2014and it is hard to<br />\nunderstand why any respectable<br />\nperson would support him.<br />\nThe blame for McCarthy's<br />\npower is implicitly placed, in an<br />\nearly scene, on the<br />\nsimple-minded citizens of<br />\nWisconsin, who chose him for the<br />\nSertate over an \"egg-headed<br />\nprofessor.\" The professors of our<br />\nnation apparently saw the danger<br />\nof McCarthy, as did the rich<br />\nlawyers (Welch) and the<br />\naristocratic Senators (Margaret<br />\nChase Smith.) One is left to think<br />\nthat despite this, McCarthy was<br />\nvery powerful.<br />\n<br />\nActually, Joe McCarthy was<br />\ntolerated, if not supported, by<br />\nthe Establishment in the United<br />\nStates. The film showed that he<br />\nwas friend and ally of Richard<br />\nNixon, the Kennedy family, and<br />\nthe Vice President of<br />\nGeorgetown University, among<br />\nothers. More indicative of the<br />\nbreadth of his support is that the<br />\nSenate, in 1953, gave him the<br />\nauthority and the money that he,<br />\nneeded to conduct his<br />\nwitch-hunts. It is important to<br />\nnote that the \"good guys\" in this<br />\nfilm were those who rationally<br />\nand deliberately attacked<br />\nCommunism, at home and<br />\nabroad, as opposed to those who,<br />\nlike McCarthy, attacked it<br />\nirrationally and over-zealously.<br />\n<br />\nThe former are exemplified by<br />\nthe Voice of America, the State<br />\nDepartment, the Army,, and<br />\nespecially' Messrs.

The<br />\nEstablishment, led by Truman,<br />\net. al., backed Chiang Kai-shek<br />\nfrom 1945 to 1949 with the<br />\nlargest outlay of funds and<br />\nweapons for a foreign nation ever<br />\nmade in U.S. history. These men<br />\nengineered the Marshall Plan<br />\nwhich European labor unions<br />\nattacked as an anti-labor plan,<br />\nand Truman set up the Loyalty<br />\nReview Boards in this country<br />\nthat had as devestating an effect<br />\non dissent as did McCarthy's<br />\ninvestigations. \"Tail-Gunner Joe\"<br />\nhad little to say about this; it<br />\nmentioned the Loyalty Boards,<br />\nbut did not explain them to<br />\nthose (probably most) viewers<br />\nwho did not know what they<br />\nwere.<br />\nNeither did the film mention<br />\nthe history of \"respectable\"<br />\nanti-Communist repression in our<br />\nhistory\u2014e.g.\" Haymarket Square,<br />\nthe Mitchell Palmer raids, the<br />\nimprisonment of Eugene Debs, or<br />\nthe executions of Sacco and<br />\nVanzetti.

Greyhound jangle. My destination is Santa Fe, New Mexico, so I've got a few<br />\nhours to kill before takeoff, a few hours to spend in downtown L.A., an area which<br />\nseems like one continual bus station, the bum's bum locale. Spanish markets own the<br />\nstreets, where fresh and not so fresh meat and produce are sold, where open bars<br />\nalternate with tropical fruit juice stands. Poor folks are tromping in and out of the<br />\nmarkets, flashing nary a smile to the luckless pedestrians.<br />\nSoon I board Greyhound 731, head for the back three rows where smoking is<br />\npermitted, toss my pack on the seat next to me to discourage anyone from sitting there,<br />\nand settle down with the final edition of the Los Angeles Times. My eyes dart up to the<br />\nfront of the bus where a whole herd of passengers are getting on, and I realize my<br />\nchances for the extra seat are slim. The last person on the bus snags the seat in question,<br />\nand immediately pulls out the biggest walking radio you'd ever want to see, plays it real<br />\nloud. The smc king section is filled with young people ready to party down, everyone<br />\nlookin' for a sood time.<br />\nAnd so the Magic Bus takes off.<br />\nThe cast'of characters went like this:<br />\nAlbert\u2014A nineteen year old geek from New York City who's rich off his old man's<br />\nchain of Supermarkets. Albert bragged on and on about the \"piece\" he carried with him,<br />\nabout the marijuana he smoked, the scotch he drank, and \"the fine tail\" he messed<br />\naround with in New York. Albert wasn't too much.<br />\ngypsy\u2014A young woman in her late teens, Gypsy's a self-proclaimed hooker with a<br />\ntaste for weed, booze and strange men. Speaks in a white trash Albuquerque drawl while<br />\nmoving from seat to seat. An hour out of L.A., Gypsy had already made plans for a<br />\nMagic Bus orgy.<br />\nT.0\u2014My original seatmate. A stud from Kansas City, heading to New York on a<br />\nsmack junket. Easy going, dripping with the \"we're all brothers\" jazz, but a likeable<br />\nsort.<br />\nhiul\u2014(aka Injun Joe) A mean Mexican Indian, just two days out of a California<br />\nprison cell. A design of scabs and scars highlight his face.<br />\nClyde, Robert, Caesar and Taylor\u2014Four young men all going to New York,fully into<br />\nthe party atmosphere,,a friendly bunch. When sober.<br />\nThrow in a creative Writing teacher from Stanford and an elderly chain smoking lady<br />\nand you've got the makings of a Magic Bus.<br />\nSo we're riding along, I'm trying to read the paper, while everyone else, save the<br />\nteacher and the old lady, are partying hard, passing beers, smoking joints in the crapper,<br />\nPlaying the static loud, getting together with some poker and handshakes all around.<br />\nYes, everyone was getting along jest fine.<br />\nGypsy was making the rounds, checking out each of the honchos, finally settling on .<br />\nT.C. and then sprawling on his lap, leaving me about half my seat. \"Listen turkey,<br />\nYou're gonna switch seats with me at the next stop so me and T.C. can spread out,<br />\nunderstand?\" Gypsy informs me with a bitchy leer. \"C'mon,\" I said, \"that's bUllshit,<br />\nI'm staying right here and y'all can move.\" Well, she didn't buy that, and started<br />\nPestering me no end, so I agreed to switch seats. She was pleased and promised to \"turn<br />\nme on to a beer.\" Hey, a real beer, I thought, and took a quick glance at the bottle of<br />\ntequila stashed in my coat.<br />\nI settle into my new lodgings, meet Paul, who yells back to Gypsy,\"Who's this jerk?\"<br />\nGypsy explains the situation and promises that he won't have to put up with me for too<br />\nlong. Greyhound, see America, I keep thinking.<br />\nAt the next stop, the partyers chipped in to buy about a dozen pints of Southern<br />\nComfort, bourbon, and cognac. Still brothers and sisters on this long ride together, they<br />\nswilled the cheap booze with gusto. Meanwhile, Paul tells me his prison story and then<br />\ntries to pawn off his watch, bracelet, toothbrush, anything to make a quick buck. I tell<br />\nhim if I had any money I wouldn't be traveling by Greyhound. He can't argue with that.<br />\nPaul's socking away the bourbon and beer, and spies my tequila, which leads him to<br />\nan immediate announcement: \"Hey, my cowboy friend has some tequila and he's gonna<br />\nshare it with everybody, right Jesse?\" I get a big cheer and then tell Paul no way. We<br />\nweren't too close after that, but I figured it'd still be cool.<br />\nMaybe an hour late- Paul spills some beer on his seat, looks around for something to<br />\n<br />\nwipe it up, and settles on the sweater resting on my shoulders. \"Hey, wait a minute<br />\nfriend, don't use my sweater,\" I protest. He yanks it back from me and says \"You do<br />\nwhat I say, motherfucker, or I'll kill you.\" I weakly replied, \"Hey, look, the sweater's<br />\nyours man, need anything else?\"<br />\nMeanwhile, things aren't going to well with the other celebrants. Albert's been<br />\ndismissed as a worthless clod, a few of the gang are puking up the cognac, and Gypsy's<br />\nwitchy laughs have turned into shrieks. She sets fire to Albert's Greyhound pillow,<br />\nAlbert complains, only to be bawled out by Gypsy's fire water lips. T.C. tells her to be<br />\ncool<br />\nThe bus driver rolls on.<br />\nNow, one of Paul's weaknesses was for little children, and right across from us were<br />\ntwo kiddies, marshalled by a terrified young woman who's trying to shake the Indian's<br />\nadvances. But she was especially upset by the language in the back, so Paul yells to the<br />\ncelebrants, \"All right, you motherfuckers, there's kids up here, so keep it decent.\" Well,<br />\nafter several of these admonishments, T.C., who's by now totally in his cups, decides<br />\nhe's had enough of this self-righteous Indian. He walks up to Paul, starts screaming like a<br />\nmadman, \"Who the hell do you think you are, motherfucker, telling me what to do<br />\nafter I've bought you whiskey and beer. All that brother jive, now you gonna shut up.\"<br />\nPaul sits down, tries to ignore the whole thing, but T.C. leaps on top of him, throwing<br />\nme against the window and my glasses to the front of the bus. I've got one hell of an<br />\nadrenalin buzz going at this point. They're scuffling for a few minutes, Robert and<br />\nTaylor have joined in, and then surprise, the bus driver pulls over to the side of the road.<br />\nT.C. hisses to Paul,\"I gotta gun cocksucker, and I'm gonna shoot your fuckin' head off,<br />\ndon't care if I do go to jail.\" I'm thinking hey this is great, guy's gotta gun, probably<br />\ntake a few others along with Paul.<br />\nBus driver comes back, gives a basic pep talk about behaving ourselves, and we're<br />\nriding again.<br />\nI'm scared silly now, getting ready to check out. Paul's muttering next to me, and<br />\nslowly draws out of his pocket a ten-inch knife decorated with the etching of a saint.<br />\n\"I'm gonna slice that nigger's throat to ribbons once we get to Phoenix, and I ain't<br />\ngonna get caught,\" Injun Joe rattles on. Terrific, I think, and sit up straight in my seat,<br />\nchain smoking, not letting my eyes close for a minute. Paul starts dozing, his head<br />\nlanding on my right shoulder. Now that's a move I wouldn't normally go for, but hey.<br />\nPaul,and I are pardners.<br />\nPanic in Arizona<br />\nThings had been quiet for about a half hour when Gypsy, decided that she and T.C.<br />\nweren't getting along anymore. She's more drunk than anyone, having thrown down<br />\nthree pints of Southern Comfort and one of cognac, and starts yelling at T.C., telling<br />\nhim what a dirty pimp he is, rotten lover, the whole works. Well, T.C., fresh from his<br />\nbout with Paul, was having none of this, and starts slapping Gypsy around, while she<br />\nscreams for,the whole bus and highway to hear. ,<br />\nBus driver lolls on.<br />\nGypsy escapes from T.C., tears up and down the bus aisle, punching anyone she can<br />\nsee in her drunken delerium--my fifth and sixth'head bruises came from this tirade--just<br />\npissing and moaning, finally arriving at the fateful words; \"You're all just a bunch of<br />\nslimy niggers, and I hate niggers!\"<br />\nThat wasn't the wisest move on Gypsy's part. Immediately, a half dozen sets of ears<br />\nperk up and Gypsy's trapped in a rumble, getting the stuffing kicked out of her, hair<br />\npulled this way and that, fingernails dug in black and white flesh. After pleas from<br />\npetrified passengers who are seeing a, disaster inpvie right before their,eyes, the bus<br />\ndriver pulls over again. Paul's awake with kniie-iti hand, T.C.'s reaching for his pistol,<br />\nand I'm clutching the rosaries in my pocket. We're stopped at the Arizona border where<br />\na sheriff comes aboard and drags off Gypsy to the local jail. After an hour, we're riding<br />\nagain, the whole bus in terror.<br />\nIt's now early in the morning and we're scheduled to make Phoenix in five hours,<br />\nPaul's last stop. So I've got hundreds of miles ahead of me, trying to get my mind off<br />\nthis predicament, but I can't, I'm just thinking about getting off the Magic Bus alive. I'm<br />\ncounting the miles on the dark highway, counting the miles, fully expecting the trip to<br />\nend in disaster.<br />\nBut oddly enough, we did get to Phoenix. I figure I'm a free man, at least if Paul<br />\nwould wake up. Ten minutes later, to my enormous relief, I see him in the station with<br />\nsuitcase in hand, so I know the ordeal is pretty much over. I saunter over to him and<br />\nglibly remark, \"Well, good luck, Paul, sure was nice to ride with you.\" \"Great,cowboy,<br />\nsure ya don't want to stop off in Phoenix with me for a couple days, I'll show you the<br />\ngood spots.\" \"Well Paul, I'd like .to, but I've gotta meet my brother, maybe next time.\"<br />\nThe rest of the trip to Santa Fe was a breeze. Most of the partyers were too crashed<br />\nout, sick, or plain scared to create any ruckus, so we just rode the Magic Bus on in. My<br />\nbrother met me at the dingy Greyhound station and handed me a beer as we waved<br />\ngoodbye to the Magic Bus. And that was the first moment of freedom and safety this<br />\ntattered cowboy extracted from Greyhound, Inc.<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022\u2022*\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022411.\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.page 10/news-letter/february 18, 1977<br />\n<br />\n...<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n44111111111<br />\n.<br />\n.4111111111.<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n11111111. .411111.1110.<br />\n<br />\nSenior Class Film Series<br />\n<br />\npresents<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\npresents<br />\n<br />\nWORkINCic<br />\nTO<br />\n'MAVEN<br />\nIASSCI\"S<br />\n<br />\nELIO PETRI'S<br />\n<br />\n11HE<br />\nCLASS<br />\nBIDES 11:1<br />\nHEA111/1EN<br />\nStarring GIAN MARIA VOLONTE<br />\nand MARIANGELA MELATO<br />\nFrom NEW UNE CINEMA<br />\n<br />\nBEST FILM, Cannes Film Festival<br />\n<br />\nI.<br />\n<br />\nELLIOTT KAMEN MC.71<br />\nA WA AJICHANDS RUA<br />\nAMES \"FAREIVE1.4 AO'LOVELY'<br />\nRQaWETAUTCNINA \u2022 CHARLOTTE EAMPLAY8 \u2022 AWNIMAM \u2022STUN4 MK MAWS<br />\n,<br />\nsioac ANINONY ZERIE \u2022 NAM DEAN MUM tra.to'<br />\nRUCXNENEEN<br />\nleavaa Ofeirff DORASam.11111<br />\naeivei vo..:us ELLIOTT XAS7N\u00a311 \u2022 MEW<br />\n1<br />\nAz c alawn=<br />\nCHANDLEN<br />\nWINOND<br />\nsf<br />\nwt..* p MAD ZELAG DOODMAN \u2022'go<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 A.\u2022-\u2022\u2022<br />\n,<br />\n41i<br />\nDAVID santE\u2022.44 aynapes,MUM 411 4IC MOON 15,-.<br />\n<br />\nintent<br />\n<br />\n\"VOLONTE IS FIRST-RATE!\"<br />\nCost/NEW YORK MAD<br />\n<br />\n\"BRILLIANTLY DIRECTED!\"<br />\nHerridge/NEW YORK POST<br />\n<br />\n\"ONE OF THE FUNNIEST<br />\nSEDUCTION SCENES EVER\"<br />\nStoop/AFTER DARK<br />\n<br />\n\"ELECTRICITY, VIGOR & PASSION!\"<br />\n<br />\nFRi. & SAT.<br />\n<br />\nFEb. 18 & 19<br />\n<br />\nWolf/CUE<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nAdmissioN $1.00<br />\n<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\n<br />\nSaturday, Feb.1 9<br />\n<br />\nTnvim,<br />\n<br />\n8:00& 10:00<br />\n5.75<br />\n<br />\nT4*-40-40-\u20224410-40-.1*-\u2022\u2022-\u2022-\u20224*-40-411*4<br />\n7:30 Pt 10:00 PM<br />\n<br />\n*\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nPLACE: SHRIVER HALL<br />\n<br />\nI ADMISSION: $1.00<br />\nNkk ScREwEd A3i1<br />\n<br />\n\"BREATHTAKING<br />\n...EXUBERANTLY FUNNY!<br />\nWatching All Screwed Up isto be witness<br />\nto a giant talent:<br />\nVincent Canby/ NEW YORK TIMES<br />\n<br />\nTHE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT'S ASSOC.<br />\nTHE GRAD CLUB THE JUNIOR CLASS<br />\n<br />\nINTERICION<br />\nDANIC<br />\n<br />\nBELLY<br />\nDANCER<br />\nARISTEA'<br />\n<br />\n\"A BRILLIANT MOVIE<br />\nthat must be seen several times!\"<br />\n<br />\nRex Reed<br />\n<br />\nGREEK<br />\nBAND<br />\n:<br />\n+GeRECIAN<br />\nODYSSEY<br />\n<br />\n\"UPROARIOUSLY<br />\nFUNNY<br />\nA strong<br />\n<br />\nentertaining,daring film from Wertmuller!\"<br />\nWilliam Wolf / CUE MAGAZINE<br />\n<br />\n\"INCREDIBLY FUNNY,\"<br />\nSan Francisco Chronicle<br />\n<br />\nBEER<br />\n<br />\nf5t LIGHT<br />\n50t DARK<br />\n40 te MICHELOB<br />\n<br />\nWINE<br />\n<br />\nLINA WERTMULLER'S<br />\n<br />\nALL SCREWED LIP<br />\nlii<br />\n<br />\nSENIORS<br />\n<br />\nNEW LINE CINEMA<br />\n<br />\nFriday, Feb. 1 8<br />\n<br />\nPG,<br />\n<br />\nSUN DAY<br />\nFEB. 20-th<br />\n<br />\n$1 es) Sfacien+<br />\n01-f9 Other<br />\n<br />\nFREE<br />\n945 -to I<br />\nMUNCH1E5<br />\nGLASS PAVILION-HOMEWOOD CAMPUS<br />\n\"YN5 HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\n<br />\n\ffebruary 18, 1977/news-letter/page 11<br />\n<br />\nGodEREy's: 110T<br />\n<br />\nSTUFF<br />\n<br />\n-It's no secret that Godfrey's Steer and Beer on Greenrnount Avenue is high on this rag's list of fave rave<br />\nbars.

The Diplomats<br />\ncontrolled the tip, taking the ball<br />\ndown court setting up for an<br />\noffensive play. F&M missed their<br />\nshot and Dan Kopcza was in<br />\nPosition for the rebound. Finston<br />\nmissed the Jays opening shot, but<br />\non the ensuing defensive play,<br />\nguard Scheinfeld forced a jump<br />\nby tying up a Diplomat offender.<br />\nAndy won the toss up, sending<br />\nthe ball to 6'8\" Uhler who hit on<br />\na beautiful five foot turnaround<br />\nJump shot for the 2-0 lead.<br />\nThe visiting opponents quickly<br />\n<br />\nInstant replay!<br />\n<br />\ntied the score off a fine passing<br />\nconnection from sophomores<br />\nKen Hopson and Mark Worley<br />\nwhich resulted in a driving layup.<br />\nUhler broke the tie by sinking a<br />\nfoul shot, but a short from<br />\nDiplomat forward John Boyer<br />\nput his team on top 4-3.

In<br />\nan era full of tussles over issues like nuclear energy.<br />\nchemical warfare, space programs and supersonic air<br />\ntransport, a new controversy has come out of the<br />\nlaboratory and started to break at local government<br />\nlevels, in the press, and on university grounds.<br />\nThis one is variously called \"recombinant DNA<br />\nresearch,\" \"gene- splicing,\" and \"genetic engineering.'<br />\nAll the terms refer to a basic concept of joining DNA<br />\nfragments -- the material that constitues genes an<br />\nprovides' the hereditary information for all life forms \u2014of<br />\none organism to the genes of a carrier (such as a virus o<br />\nplasmid). This recombinant \"vector\" is then introduce(<br />\ninto the cells of another organism, where it may grow a:<br />\nan \"adopted\" gene. Current research mostly involves thl<br />\ntransfer of animal or plant genes to host bacteria cells.<br />\nBy using recombinant techniques, scientists lool<br />\nforward to tremendous benefits, while critics envisioi<br />\ndangerous scenarios. The debate, though, has a few<br />\nunusual features. The battlelines are not clearly drawn: a<br />\nnumber of leading biologists are strongly opposed to the<br />\ncurrent research, while others committed to<br />\nenvironmental safety in many areas welcome the new<br />\nOpportunities. And the guidelines and safeguards now in<br />\neffect for recombinant work came from within the<br />\nscientific community, before the research had begun in<br />\nearnest,<br />\nIn July 1973, at the Gordon Research Conference on<br />\nNucleic Acids, scientists recognized the potential hazards<br />\nof the new gene-splicing techniques and sent letters to<br />\nthe National Academy of Science, prompting the NAS to<br />\nset up a review committee and call for a moratorium on<br />\nexperiments pending investigation. An international<br />\nconference was also proposed, and in February 1975,<br />\n150 people gathered at the Asilomar Conference Center\"<br />\nin Pacific Grove, California, to discuss genetic<br />\nengineering and possible ways to deal with its risks.<br />\nThe report from Asilomar spurred a series of three<br />\nmeetings of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)<br />\nRecombinant Advisory Committee in 1975. The Director<br />\nof NIH, Donald Frederickson, then worked with his own<br />\nadvisory committee, going over specific guidelines drawn<br />\ntogether from the three separate meetings. Finally, in<br />\nJuly 1976, the NW issued its settled-on guidelines to<br />\nreplace the recommendations of the Asilomar<br />\nConference.<br />\nSo within three years, scientists had realized the risks<br />\nof their new research and had taken it upon themselves<br />\nto create a set of guidelines to regulate the work about to<br />\nbe done. This self-policing, before recombinant research<br />\nwent full ahead, is justly referred to as a foresightful act<br />\nof responsibility; ironically, it has also drawn the valid<br />\ncharge that \"the Committee authorized to write the<br />\nGuidelines consisted primarily of scientists interested in<br />\ndoing this research.\" That quote comes from Science for<br />\nthe People, a Boston-based group which includes some<br />\nprominent biology professors among its members. They<br />\nAn d other critics contend that the NIH Recombinant<br />\nAdvisory Committee -- with but one non-science advisor<br />\nrepresents a conflict of interest, asking the incendiaries<br />\nto put out the fire.<br />\nIn the introductiOn to the NIH guidelines,<br />\nFrederickson stated: \"Recombinant DNA research brings<br />\nto the fore certain problems in 'addressing the potential<br />\nimpact of basic science on society as a whole, including<br />\nthe manner of providing public participation in those<br />\nassessments,...lt is not surprising that scientists in other<br />\nfields and the general public have difficulty in<br />\nunderstanding advances in recombinant DNA research.<br />\nYet public awareness and understanding of this line of<br />\ninvestigation is vital.\" Last year, \"public participation\"<br />\nwas carried out in a heated manner in Cambridge. The<br />\nCity Council, after finding out about some planned<br />\nhigher-level risk experiments to be done at Harvard and<br />\nMIT, voted a \"good faith\" (since their action had no<br />\nforce of law) three-month moratorium on the reserach. A<br />\nreview board was established; last month, it gave the<br />\ngo-ahead to lower-level experiments.<br /><br />\nThe public hearings and council actions in Cambridge<br />\npolitical<br />\nbrought out dissension in faculty ranks,<br />\nopportunism on the part of some council members, and<br />\ncommunity backlash against the two schools. Dr. Robert<br />\nDot tin, a biology professor at Hopkins who had<br />\npreviously been at MIT, recalled that \"the experiments<br />\nwere frightening to some people. There were not<br />\nwell-regulated facilifies...I think that in Harvard's case<br />\nthere was reason to be concerned.\" He also noted that<br />\npeople around Harvard and MIT are \"concerned about<br />\nhow much input the public has. They feel the science is<br />\ntoo dangerous to be left to scientists alone.\"<br />\nOther cities where universities have proposed or are<br />\ndoing recombinant DNA research have taken action,<br />\nthough not on the level of the Cambridge moratorium.<br />\nReview committees in San Diego and Ann Arbor (the<br />\nlatter an in-university affair) made recommendations<br />\nabout research at the local universities; public hearings<br />\nand panels in Bloomington and Princeton brought out<br />\noften tense discussion on the recombinant work.<br />\nMeanwhile, two states (California and New York) are<br />\nmoving toward some sort of legislation to regulate the<br />\ngene- splicing research. As states ponder bills, it is<br />\nsignificant to note that the NIH guidelines are just that -guidelines, not regulations. Within the academic<br />\ncommunity, researchers are under heavy pressure to<br />\nfollow the guidelines, since they are usually funded by<br />\nthe NIH. And, as Dr. Robert Ballantine of the Hopkins<br />\nBiology Department explains, \"you can't get published<br />\nunless you've followed the guidelines. If there was a<br />\nquestion of perjury, your name as a scientist would be<br />\nmud...glory doesn't come from headlines in the New<br />\nYork Times. It comes with the publication of journal<br />\narticles.\"<br />\nIndustry, however, also has a stake in genetic<br />\nengineering. Currently, there are seven major<br />\npharmaceutical companies involved in recombiant<br />\nresearch; they are well aware of the ,N11-1 guidelines, but<br />\nonly have to accept them voluntarily. The corporations<br />\nare hesitant about any federally- adopted regulations<br />\nparallel to the guidelines that would require approval of<br />\nall research plans since disclosure would wreck patent<br />\nopportunities. At present, then, much secrecy surrounds<br />\nthe industry's research, as writers for the People's<br />\nBusiness Commission discovered after contacting<br />\ncompany representatives.<br />\nWhat they did find was an Interagency Committee set<br />\nup by then- President Ford last September, responsible<br />\n\"to review federal policy on the conduct of research<br />\ninvolving the creation of new life forms.\" This<br />\ncommittee, under the supervision of NIH, has many<br />\nmembers with backgrounds in industry, another possible<br />\nconflict- of-interest arrangement. As the PBC reported in<br />\nMother Jones magzine, \"a significant faction of the<br />\nInteragency Committee is urging that federal guidelines<br />\non recombinant DNA research be made voluntary and<br />\nthat the industry be left to police itself. In the unlikely<br />\nevent that the committee takes a tougher stance and<br />\nrecommends, for instance, the creation of a new<br />\nsuper-agency with enough money and muscle to closely<br /><br />\npolice all NDA research, look for the inductrv to resist.\"<br />\nThe committee's report, originally due in January, now<br />\nappears scheduled for March as the earliest release date.<br />\nWhether industry will follow the present NIH<br />\nguidelines -- which \"should be mandatory for anyone<br />\ndoing research,\" according to Dr. Eric Weinberg of the<br />\nBiology Department -- remains to be seen. A recent<br />\nScience article reports that industry spokesmen have<br />\nindicated a desire for some government agency to follow<br />\ntheir research, if only to get out of the \"fishbowl\" of<br />\nsuspicion they are now in.<br />\nIf an agency does come to have some responsibility for<br />\nindustry action (the NIH the most likely prospect),<br />\nhowever, it faces the problem the old Atomic Energy<br />\nCommission had: it would be charged with regulating an<br />\nindustry that it promoted at the same time. Viewing the<br />\nred tape the nuclear industry now encounters from AEC<br />\nspin-offs, the pharmaceuticai companies would certainly<br />\nfight any attempts at a purely regulatory body that could<br />\nseverely delay their research. The industry, after all, is<br />\ninvolved in a competitive situation and threats to patents<br />\nand the research behind those patents would not be<br />\ntaken lightly.<br />\nBesides academic and industry research, there remains<br />\nthe question of possible defense work in recombinant<br />\nDNA research. Some scientists have cited the effective<br />\nfailure of the Army to produce any controllable<br />\nbiological weapons when they engaged in that research as<br />\na reassuring sign. The new gene-splicing techniques,<br />\nhowever, would seem an unhealthy tool for defense and<br />\nintelligence workers to have, given the record of their<br />\nrecent practices.<br />\nReturning to the subject of the NIH guidelines: while<br />\nacademic researchers observe them, the following of the<br />\nregulations does not imply satisfaction. A straw poll<br />\ntaken by the Federation of AMerican Scientists found<br />\n;4% of the biologists and 32% of those in other fields<br />\nbelieved the guidelines to be \"probably insufficiently<br />\ncautious.\" At the same time, many scientists find them<br />\ntoo stringent; as Brown comments, \"I call it strict when<br />\nyou must work on a harmless bacteria under conditions<br />\nthat are more strict than those for disease- causing<br />\nbacteria.\"<br />\nWith increasing publicity about recombinant DNA<br />\nresearch -- especially information that can be strongly<br />\nbiased on one side or plainly wrong -- the controversy<br />\nseems to be heading toward more difficult regions, rather<br />\nthan smoothing out and passing over. Again from<br />\nFrderickson's introduction to the NIH guidelines, \"Public<br />\nresponsibility weighs heavily in this genetic research<br />\narea...the responsibility of the scientists involved is as<br />\ninescapable as is their opportunity to beneficially enrich<br />\nour understanding.\"<br /><br />\nNext week -- Reconzbinant DNA research at<br />\nHopkins;accounts of the benefits, risks,and<br />\nguidelines ofgene-splicing; and more.<br /><br />\npage 2/news-letterifebruary 18, 1977<br /><br />\nAnderson's investigators talk:<br />\nBy MARC DUVOIS1N<br />\nHarvard Theologian Harvey<br />\nCox is fond of suggesting that the;<br />\nmedical and legal professions<br />\ndraw up strict ethical guidelines.<br />\nSuch an approach, however,<br />\nmight be better applied to the<br />\npractice of journalism, if<br />\nWednesday's address by two<br />\noperatives of the Jack<br />\nAnderson -Les Whitten news<br />\nempire is any indication.<br />\nJim Grady, a University of<br />\nMissouri journalism graduate, and<br />\nJulia Rose, a recent alumna of<br />\nHopkins' School for Advanced ,<br />\nInternational Relations, are two<br />\nof the dozen or so anonymous<br />\nsoot -gatherers who keep<br />\nAnderson's nationally syndicated<br />\n\"Washington Merry-Go-Roundfull of the stuff that brings<br />\nknaves to justice, titillates the<br />\nsuburban readerships, and<br />\noccasionally showers disrepute<br />\non those who least deserve it.<br />\nTo work for Anderson, both<br />\nagreed, is to be affiliated with a<br />\nrevered American institution.<br />\nDisgruntled<br />\ngovernment<br />\nfunctionaries with an axe to grind<br />\ncontact Anderson first.

It certainly instills<br />\na fear of growing old.<br />\nResearch in the area of aging,<br />\nhowever, has shown that. there<br />\nare only two kinds of physical<br />\nsenility which are irrever sible.<br />\nThese are the chronic brain<br />\nsyndromes caused by<br />\ndeterioration of brain cells (senile<br />\npsychdsis), and the hardening of<br />\nthe arteries, cutting off the blood<br />\nsupply to the brain,<br />\n(arteriosclerotic).

This explicitly political play<br />\nis the story of the efforts of a<br />\nsmall, Chinese village (Long Bow)<br />\nto carry out the socialist<br />\nrevolution between 1945 and<br />\n1949. Fanshen was adapted from<br />\nWilliam Hinton's documentary<br />\nbook of the same name which,<br />\nby focusing on a single<br />\ncommunity, highlighted the<br />\nstruggle of the entire Chinese<br />\npeople to \"fanShen\" -- to stand<br />\nup, to throw off the landlord's<br />\nyoke and to create a new world.<br />\nAs Comment magazine said,<br />\n\"The play is, however, much<br />\nmore than an historic record of<br /><br />\nMore AIM programs<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nbeing exposed 'o serious political<br />\nand historical questions.<br />\nIn --fact, the Little Flags<br />\nTheatre Collective, which is<br />\npresenting the play, expressly<br />\ntries to blend a political message<br />\ninto .each of its productions.<br />\nAccording to Hanna Lessinger of<br />\nGuardian, the group \"can<br />\nproduce theatre which is at once<br />\nmoving, entertaining,<br />\n'professional' in its standards and<br />\npolitically committed,\" without<br />\nalienating the normal audience.<br />\nIn addition, Maxine Klein, the<br />\nplay's director, is nationally<br />\nknown for her abilities as a<br />\ndirector and playwright in<br />\ncombining vivid theatricality<br />\nwith political impact. In Boston<br />\nshe has been named \"Best<br />\nDirector of the Year\" for two<br />\nconsecutive years. Ms. Klein has<br />\nsaid that one goal of the<br />\nproduction is to convey to the<br />\naudience the idea that , \"People<br />\ncan change the course of their<br />\nlives.\"<br />\nAt first glance this may not<br />\nseem to be so astounding a<br />\nstatement. People's lives are<br />\nalways changing. We all grow<br />\nolder, pick up new interests,<br />\ndiscard old ones, and so on. But<br />\nin the context of Ms. Klein's<br />\nquote and of Fanshen, the notion<br />\nof changing people's lives implies<br />\nsomething much broader. It<br />\nimplies the extended meaning of<br />\nthe word fanshen - \"the creation<br />\nof a new productive base, new<br />\nsocial relationships, new forms of<br />\nself - government, new ways of<br />\nthinking ...\" In essence, then, it<br />\nimplies the complete<br />\ntransformation of the entire<br />\nsociety.<br />\nFanshen provides the Hopkins<br />\n.:ommunity with the rare chance<br />\no see good, entertaining,<br />\ndolitical theatre.

The negatives for the<br />\nfirst three weeks filming of his<br />\nfirst English language film,<br />\nCasanova, had been stolen along<br />\nwith a third of Pier Paolo<br />\nPasolini's \"Salo, or the 120 Days<br />\nof Sodom\" and Damiano<br />\nDamiani's \"A Genius, Two<br />\nAssociates and a Fool.\" Fellini<br />\nand his producer Alberto<br />\nGrimaldi estimated the value of<br />\nthe missing negatives to be in the<br />\nmillions. \"For me, the damage is<br />\nincalculable,\" Fellini told the<br />\npress. \"Not only would three<br />\nweeks of work be ruined if the<br />\nnegatives are not returned, but<br />\nthe entire planning of the film as<br />\nwell.\"_<br />\nThe undamaged negatives were<br />\nrecovered and production<br />\ncontinued. What, if anything,<br />\nhappened to his \"entire<br />\nplanning\"? The Casanova which<br />\npremiered last Friday at the<br />\nTowson theater is certainly not<br />\nlacking in visual brilliance\u2014<br />\nindeed nearly every sequence is<br />\nbeautifully photographed, but<br />\nthe accompanying history of<br />\nGiacomo Casanova, though<br />\ncertainly not beautiful\u2014and we<br />\nwouldn't expect it to be, isn't<br />\nbelievable either. The fault<br />\ndoesn't lie with actor Donald<br />\nSutherland so much as it does<br />\nwith director-screenwriter Fellini.<br />\nHe should've either strengthened<br />\nthe script, presented us with<br />\nempathetic characters and<br />\nsituations, or thrown the script<br />\naway and given us a succession of<br />\nstrikirg visual images.<br />\nFellini's rich pictures and<br />\nshallow plot are nearly<br />\nirresistable: one leans back, the<br />\ndreamlike images flow by, and,<br />\nenchanted with the sheer beauty<br />\none doesn't ask what it all means.<br />\nI can think of two possible<br />\ninterpretations. In the first we<br />\nhave a young Casanova, who<br />\nwhenever he is engaged in sexual<br />\ngymnastics is accompanied by a<br />\nmechanical, golden bird. The<br />\nconnection between the<br />\nmechanical movements of the<br />\nbird and the mechanical nature<br />\nof his own exploits is soor<br />\nobvious. His world is one with<br />\n\"undefined boundaries of<br />\namorous interest\" and he<br />\nmaintains a reputation<br />\nthroughout Europe for what<br />\nBurgess' Alex would call the old<br />\n\"in-out in -out.\" The sex is<br />\nfrenzied, often a contest, rarely<br />\nintimate. There are voyeurs,<br />\nconnoisseurs of the act, who<br />\nevaluate his performances.<br />\nNino Rota's music has a<br />\nmechanistic nature and contains<br />\nelements of the circus. It<br />\nenhances the image of Casanova<br />\nas a showman going through his<br />\nroutines. He performs, not just<br />\nfor his partner, but often for a<br />\ngroup. Sex for these people<br />\nseems to offer anything from<br />\npersonal physical satisfaction to<br />\nthe satisfaction of voyeuristic<br />\nimpulses, but tie idea that sex is<br />\nan expression of affection seems<br />\nforeign to them.<br />\n'Toward the end. an aged<br />\nCasanova. forsaken by Eros,<br />\ndecides to commit suicide rather<br /><br />\nthan live an impotent life. Ever<br />\nthe showman, he dresses in his<br />\nfinest clothes before walking into<br />\nthe Thames. He notices a giantess<br />\non shore, climbs out, and once<br />\nagain is immersed in an orgiastic<br />\nworld. He ends his days with a<br />\nmachine, a mechanical woman,<br />\nand when he makes love to her<br />\nwe conclude, naturally, that<br />\nlovemaking has become a rather<br />\ndesperate routine.<br />\nOn one level, the movie is no<br />\nmore that a succession of orgies<br />\nand Fellini is saying no more<br />\nthan that sexual license, while an<br />\nawful lot of fun, leads to no good<br />\nend. It's really the fantasy of a<br />\nCatholic schoolboy, an episodic<br />\nadventure in voyeurism on<br />\nFellini's part. Lascivious nuns,<br />\nthe erotic mysticism of the age,<br />\nand homosexual ballets are all<br />\nwonderfully naughty, and Fellini<br />\nallows us, vicariously, to share in<br />\nthe debauchery, giggle at these<br />\nextreme representations of our<br />\nown fantasies.<br />\nOur middle class repressions<br />\nare lifted, but a sense of guilt is<br />\ncatholic, because naughtiness,<br />\nhowever much fun it may by,<br />\nsimply isn't right. The old,<br />\nunhappy Casanova at the end of<br />\nthe film has gotten what he<br />\ndeserves. The audience has both<br />\nshared in his license and punished<br />\nhim for it.

It ain't the real thang.<br />\nTom: What is the real thing?<br />\nDuckey: Ali lived in Etlanna long nuf to know<br />\nthat Co-Cola is the real thang.

Hey hey hey,<br />\nDNA..<br /><br />\nhustle<br />\nLast week's conviction of Larry Flynt in a Columbus,<br />\nOhio court is another sign of the troubles the Suprem<br />\ne<br />\nCourt invited with its ruling on obscenity a few years<br />\nago.<br />\nFlynt was sentenced to seven to twenty-five years and fined<br />\n$1,000 for his actions as publisher of Hustler that led to the<br />\nmagazine finding its way into the hands of decent<br />\nColumbus citizens.<br />\nNow Hustler may have no more socially redeeming<br />\nfeatures than, say, the News-American, but the conviction<br />\nraises two disturbing points beyond the question of<br />\nobscenity. First, one of the charges against Flynt was<br />\nengaging in criminal conspiracy -- as publisher, he was<br />\nresponsible for the magazine's distribution -- and thus could<br />\nbe dragged into court from anywhere in the country. The<br />\nthreat of prosecuting any employee involved in<br />\na<br />\nnationally-distributed media offering (as happened<br />\nin<br />\nGeorgia with a bit .actor in Deep Throat) for the<br />\nlocal<br />\ncriminal activity is ludicrous, to say thc least.<br />\nThis goes along with the second problem, namely that<br />\nthe Supreme Court's decision to leave obscenity<br />\nto<br />\n\"community\" standards opened the door for<br />\nnarrow-minded case-hungry District Attorneys to haul in<br />\ntheir favorite objectionable person. Since community<br />\nstandards are just about whatqer the local DA decides<br />\nthem to be, the First Amendment is in for serious trouble<br />\nin<br />\nmany areas of the country.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing in response to an<br />\nad placed in the Friday edition of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nNews-Letter. I found this ad to<br />\nbe in extremely bad taste and<br />\noffensively sexist. If this<br />\nrepresents the attitude of the<br />\nBETA crowd perhaps it is best<br />\nthat they stay wherever they are<br />\nnow. I know that in the name of<br />\n\"freedom of the press\" we tend<br />\nto print anything requested,<br />\nhowever. I would hope that as<br />\nwomen in responsible positions<br />\n(and you do have such positions)<br />\nyou would lend some support to<br />\nelimination of sexist<br />\nadvertising by refusing such an<br />\nad.<br />\nI hope that in the future you<br />\nwill be a little more sensitive to<br />\nthat portion of your readers who<br />\naren't particularly interested in<br />\nhaving their bodies used as bait<br />\nfor encouraging others to have a<br />\ngood time.<br />\nLorinda Riddle<br />\nAdministrative Assist.<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain<br /><br />\nTo the Editorr:<br />\nThe February 11th printing of<br />\nthe News-Letter contained an<br />\nadvertisement for the \"Betas'<br />\nCome Back Ball.\" It is unclear<br />\nwhere they were corning back<br />\nfrom, my guess would be a<br />\ngigantic ego trip. This crude<br />\ndisplay of unaesthetic body<br />\nportrayal proved a mockery of<br />\nfemale existence. The News-letter<br />\ntotally disregarded the insult that<br />\nthis ad paid its female reader.<br />\nThe intent of the advertisement<br />\nmay have been to communicate a<br />\nparty of some sort but instead of<br />\nadvertising the uplift of spirits it<br />\ncapitalized on the uplift of the<br />\nfemale breast. Until women and<br />\nother minorities are treated With<br />\nthe respect they are deserving of<br />\nour society will not move<br />\nforward.<br />\nNancy McLernon<br />\nSchool of Public Health<br />\nTo the Editor:,<br />\nHow's this for a letter?<br />\nEgg Roll Norton<br /><br />\nBy STEPHEN SMITH<br />\n\"Tail-Gunner Joe,\" the recent<br />\ntelevision film, was a<br />\nmuch-needed introduction to, or<br />\nreminder of, the anti-Communist<br />\nhysteria that was at large in this<br />\ncountry in the early Cold War<br />\nperiod. The film addressed itself<br />\nto the question: Why wasn't<br />\nMcCarthy stopped? In answering<br />\nthat question, though, the film<br />\nemphasized peripheral points,<br />\nand ultimately offered them as a<br />\nreal explanation, and did not ask<br />\nthe broader, related, and more<br />\nimportant question of why the<br />\nentire national<br />\nEstablishment---government,<br />\nbusiness, education,<br />\netc.---undertook or at least<br />\ntolerated an anti-Communist<br />\ncrusade at that point in history.<br />\nThis film had much to<br />\nrecommend it. First, while<br />\n\"McCarthyism\" has become part<br />\nof our political vocabulary, far<br />\ntoo few people have more than a<br />\nvague idea of what it means, or<br />\nof how the word originated. This<br />\nfilm will help to correct that. It<br />\ngave several concrete examples of<br />\nlives ruined by McCarthy's<br />\ninvestigations and by the climate<br />\nsurrounding those investigations.<br />\nThe film suggested McCarthy's<br />\nmotivations and the source of his<br />\ninfluence by showing his<br />\nconnections with certain<br />\nbusinesses, with the Catholic<br />\nChurch, and with crypto-Fascist<br />\nelements in this country. The<br />\nmakers of this film did not duck<br />\ntouchy issues, such as how<br />\nMcCarthy was tolerated by two<br />\nPresidents of the United States,<br />\nand how he was greatly<br />\npublicized by an uncritical press.<br />\nIn \"Tail-Gunner Joe,\" though,<br />\nit almost appears as if McCarthy<br />\nwere alone in this crusade. One<br />\nwonders not why he wasn't<br />\nstopped, but how he ever got<br />\nstarted. The impression is given<br />\nthat every respectable person<br />\ndisapproved of McCarthy, though<br />\nthey may have lacked the<br />\ncourage to attack him: Truman,<br />\nEisenhower, and McCarthy's<br />\nfellow Senators. McCarthy, in<br />\nthis film, was a pathetic<br /><br />\nMacNelly<br /><br />\nfigure\u2014none too bright,<br />\nalcoholic, unprincipled, corrupt,<br />\nand paranoid\u2014and it is hard to<br />\nunderstand why any respectable<br />\nperson would support him.<br />\nThe blame for McCarthy's<br />\npower is implicitly placed, in an<br />\nearly scene, on the<br />\nsimple-minded citizens of<br />\nWisconsin, who chose him for the<br />\nSertate over an \"egg-headed<br />\nprofessor.\" The professors of our<br />\nnation apparently saw the danger<br />\nof McCarthy, as did the rich<br />\nlawyers (Welch) and the<br />\naristocratic Senators (Margaret<br />\nChase Smith.) One is left to think<br />\nthat despite this, McCarthy was<br />\nvery powerful.<br /><br />\nActually, Joe McCarthy was<br />\ntolerated, if not supported, by<br />\nthe Establishment in the United<br />\nStates. The film showed that he<br />\nwas friend and ally of Richard<br />\nNixon, the Kennedy family, and<br />\nthe Vice President of<br />\nGeorgetown University, among<br />\nothers. More indicative of the<br />\nbreadth of his support is that the<br />\nSenate, in 1953, gave him the<br />\nauthority and the money that he,<br />\nneeded to conduct his<br />\nwitch-hunts. It is important to<br />\nnote that the \"good guys\" in this<br />\nfilm were those who rationally<br />\nand deliberately attacked<br />\nCommunism, at home and<br />\nabroad, as opposed to those who,<br />\nlike McCarthy, attacked it<br />\nirrationally and over-zealously.<br /><br />\nThe former are exemplified by<br />\nthe Voice of America, the State<br />\nDepartment, the Army,, and<br />\nespecially' Messrs. Truman,<br />\nAcheson, and Marshall.<br />\n\"Tail-Gunner Joe\" implied that<br />\n\"rational\" anti-Communism was<br />\nthe opposite of McCarthyism.<br />\nActually, while the approaches<br />\nwere different, both were aimed<br />\nat similar goals and driven by<br />\nsimilar spirits.<br />\nThe film practically ignores<br />\nconcrete examples of \"rational\"<br />\nanti -Communism. The<br />\nEstablishment, led by Truman,<br />\net. al., backed Chiang Kai-shek<br />\nfrom 1945 to 1949 with the<br />\nlargest outlay of funds and<br />\nweapons for a foreign nation ever<br />\nmade in U.S. history. These men<br />\nengineered the Marshall Plan<br />\nwhich European labor unions<br />\nattacked as an anti-labor plan,<br />\nand Truman set up the Loyalty<br />\nReview Boards in this country<br />\nthat had as devestating an effect<br />\non dissent as did McCarthy's<br />\ninvestigations. \"Tail-Gunner Joe\"<br />\nhad little to say about this; it<br />\nmentioned the Loyalty Boards,<br />\nbut did not explain them to<br />\nthose (probably most) viewers<br />\nwho did not know what they<br />\nwere.<br />\nNeither did the film mention<br />\nthe history of \"respectable\"<br />\nanti-Communist repression in our<br />\nhistory\u2014e.g.\" Haymarket Square,<br />\nthe Mitchell Palmer raids, the<br />\nimprisonment of Eugene Debs, or<br />\nthe executions of Sacco and<br />\nVanzetti. Anti-Communism was<br />\nthe cornerstone of both foreign<br />\nand domestic policy in the U.S.<br />\nin the post-World-War-II era, and<br />\nthese policies were in a tradition<br />\nof imperialism and repression<br />\nhanded down by generations of ,<br />\n\"respectable\" men who ruled<br />\nAmerica.<br />\n\"The McCarthy Era\" was an<br />\nextraordinery time, but it, was<br />\nalso part of that tradition.<br />\n\"Tail-Gunner Joe,\" by treating<br />\nboth McCarthy and McCarthyism<br />\nas aberrations, did not help us, as<br />\nmuch as it might have, to<br />\nunderstand the meaning of that<br />\nperiod.<br /><br />\nInjun Joe<br />\nversus<br /><br />\nThe saga of\u2022 the Magic Bus: Ridin'the Greyhound trails<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\n\"The Greyhound Ameripass offers you something no other kind of mass<br />\ntransportation can.

Spanish markets own the<br />\nstreets, where fresh and not so fresh meat and produce are sold, where open bars<br />\nalternate with tropical fruit juice stands. Poor folks are tromping in and out of the<br />\nmarkets, flashing nary a smile to the luckless pedestrians.<br />\nSoon I board Greyhound 731, head for the back three rows where smoking is<br />\npermitted, toss my pack on the seat next to me to discourage anyone from sitting there,<br />\nand settle down with the final edition of the Los Angeles Times. My eyes dart up to the<br />\nfront of the bus where a whole herd of passengers are getting on, and I realize my<br />\nchances for the extra seat are slim. The last person on the bus snags the seat in question,<br />\nand immediately pulls out the biggest walking radio you'd ever want to see, plays it real<br />\nloud. The smc king section is filled with young people ready to party down, everyone<br />\nlookin' for a sood time.<br />\nAnd so the Magic Bus takes off.<br />\nThe cast'of characters went like this:<br />\nAlbert\u2014A nineteen year old geek from New York City who's rich off his old man's<br />\nchain of Supermarkets. Albert bragged on and on about the \"piece\" he carried with him,<br />\nabout the marijuana he smoked, the scotch he drank, and \"the fine tail\" he messed<br />\naround with in New York. Albert wasn't too much.<br />\ngypsy\u2014A young woman in her late teens, Gypsy's a self-proclaimed hooker with a<br />\ntaste for weed, booze and strange men. Speaks in a white trash Albuquerque drawl while<br />\nmoving from seat to seat. An hour out of L.A., Gypsy had already made plans for a<br />\nMagic Bus orgy.<br />\nT.0\u2014My original seatmate. A stud from Kansas City, heading to New York on a<br />\nsmack junket. Easy going, dripping with the \"we're all brothers\" jazz, but a likeable<br />\nsort.<br />\nhiul\u2014(aka Injun Joe) A mean Mexican Indian, just two days out of a California<br />\nprison cell. A design of scabs and scars highlight his face.<br />\nClyde, Robert, Caesar and Taylor\u2014Four young men all going to New York,fully into<br />\nthe party atmosphere,,a friendly bunch. When sober.<br />\nThrow in a creative Writing teacher from Stanford and an elderly chain smoking lady<br />\nand you've got the makings of a Magic Bus.<br />\nSo we're riding along, I'm trying to read the paper, while everyone else, save the<br />\nteacher and the old lady, are partying hard, passing beers, smoking joints in the crapper,<br />\nPlaying the static loud, getting together with some poker and handshakes all around.<br />\nYes, everyone was getting along jest fine.<br />\nGypsy was making the rounds, checking out each of the honchos, finally settling on .<br />\nT.C. and then sprawling on his lap, leaving me about half my seat. \"Listen turkey,<br />\nYou're gonna switch seats with me at the next stop so me and T.C. can spread out,<br />\nunderstand?\" Gypsy informs me with a bitchy leer. \"C'mon,\" I said, \"that's bUllshit,<br />\nI'm staying right here and y'all can move.\" Well, she didn't buy that, and started<br />\nPestering me no end, so I agreed to switch seats. She was pleased and promised to \"turn<br />\nme on to a beer.\" Hey, a real beer, I thought, and took a quick glance at the bottle of<br />\ntequila stashed in my coat.<br />\nI settle into my new lodgings, meet Paul, who yells back to Gypsy,\"Who's this jerk?\"<br />\nGypsy explains the situation and promises that he won't have to put up with me for too<br />\nlong. Greyhound, see America, I keep thinking.<br />\nAt the next stop, the partyers chipped in to buy about a dozen pints of Southern<br />\nComfort, bourbon, and cognac. Still brothers and sisters on this long ride together, they<br />\nswilled the cheap booze with gusto. Meanwhile, Paul tells me his prison story and then<br />\ntries to pawn off his watch, bracelet, toothbrush, anything to make a quick buck. I tell<br />\nhim if I had any money I wouldn't be traveling by Greyhound. He can't argue with that.<br />\nPaul's socking away the bourbon and beer, and spies my tequila, which leads him to<br />\nan immediate announcement: \"Hey, my cowboy friend has some tequila and he's gonna<br />\nshare it with everybody, right Jesse?\" I get a big cheer and then tell Paul no way. We<br />\nweren't too close after that, but I figured it'd still be cool.<br />\nMaybe an hour late- Paul spills some beer on his seat, looks around for something to<br /><br />\nwipe it up, and settles on the sweater resting on my shoulders. \"Hey, wait a minute<br />\nfriend, don't use my sweater,\" I protest. He yanks it back from me and says \"You do<br />\nwhat I say, motherfucker, or I'll kill you.\" I weakly replied, \"Hey, look, the sweater's<br />\nyours man, need anything else?\"<br />\nMeanwhile, things aren't going to well with the other celebrants. Albert's been<br />\ndismissed as a worthless clod, a few of the gang are puking up the cognac, and Gypsy's<br />\nwitchy laughs have turned into shrieks. She sets fire to Albert's Greyhound pillow,<br />\nAlbert complains, only to be bawled out by Gypsy's fire water lips. T.C. tells her to be<br />\ncool<br />\nThe bus driver rolls on.<br />\nNow, one of Paul's weaknesses was for little children, and right across from us were<br />\ntwo kiddies, marshalled by a terrified young woman who's trying to shake the Indian's<br />\nadvances. But she was especially upset by the language in the back, so Paul yells to the<br />\ncelebrants, \"All right, you motherfuckers, there's kids up here, so keep it decent.\" Well,<br />\nafter several of these admonishments, T.C., who's by now totally in his cups, decides<br />\nhe's had enough of this self-righteous Indian. He walks up to Paul, starts screaming like a<br />\nmadman, \"Who the hell do you think you are, motherfucker, telling me what to do<br />\nafter I've bought you whiskey and beer. All that brother jive, now you gonna shut up.\"<br />\nPaul sits down, tries to ignore the whole thing, but T.C. leaps on top of him, throwing<br />\nme against the window and my glasses to the front of the bus. I've got one hell of an<br />\nadrenalin buzz going at this point. They're scuffling for a few minutes, Robert and<br />\nTaylor have joined in, and then surprise, the bus driver pulls over to the side of the road.<br />\nT.C. hisses to Paul,\"I gotta gun cocksucker, and I'm gonna shoot your fuckin' head off,<br />\ndon't care if I do go to jail.\" I'm thinking hey this is great, guy's gotta gun, probably<br />\ntake a few others along with Paul.<br />\nBus driver comes back, gives a basic pep talk about behaving ourselves, and we're<br />\nriding again.<br />\nI'm scared silly now, getting ready to check out. Paul's muttering next to me, and<br />\nslowly draws out of his pocket a ten-inch knife decorated with the etching of a saint.<br />\n\"I'm gonna slice that nigger's throat to ribbons once we get to Phoenix, and I ain't<br />\ngonna get caught,\" Injun Joe rattles on. Terrific, I think, and sit up straight in my seat,<br />\nchain smoking, not letting my eyes close for a minute. Paul starts dozing, his head<br />\nlanding on my right shoulder. Now that's a move I wouldn't normally go for, but hey.<br />\nPaul,and I are pardners.<br />\nPanic in Arizona<br />\nThings had been quiet for about a half hour when Gypsy, decided that she and T.C.<br />\nweren't getting along anymore. She's more drunk than anyone, having thrown down<br />\nthree pints of Southern Comfort and one of cognac, and starts yelling at T.C., telling<br />\nhim what a dirty pimp he is, rotten lover, the whole works. Well, T.C., fresh from his<br />\nbout with Paul, was having none of this, and starts slapping Gypsy around, while she<br />\nscreams for,the whole bus and highway to hear. ,<br />\nBus driver lolls on.<br />\nGypsy escapes from T.C., tears up and down the bus aisle, punching anyone she can<br />\nsee in her drunken delerium--my fifth and sixth'head bruises came from this tirade--just<br />\npissing and moaning, finally arriving at the fateful words; \"You're all just a bunch of<br />\nslimy niggers, and I hate niggers!\"<br />\nThat wasn't the wisest move on Gypsy's part. Immediately, a half dozen sets of ears<br />\nperk up and Gypsy's trapped in a rumble, getting the stuffing kicked out of her, hair<br />\npulled this way and that, fingernails dug in black and white flesh. After pleas from<br />\npetrified passengers who are seeing a, disaster inpvie right before their,eyes, the bus<br />\ndriver pulls over again. Paul's awake with kniie-iti hand, T.C.'s reaching for his pistol,<br />\nand I'm clutching the rosaries in my pocket. We're stopped at the Arizona border where<br />\na sheriff comes aboard and drags off Gypsy to the local jail. After an hour, we're riding<br />\nagain, the whole bus in terror.<br />\nIt's now early in the morning and we're scheduled to make Phoenix in five hours,<br />\nPaul's last stop. So I've got hundreds of miles ahead of me, trying to get my mind off<br />\nthis predicament, but I can't, I'm just thinking about getting off the Magic Bus alive. I'm<br />\ncounting the miles on the dark highway, counting the miles, fully expecting the trip to<br />\nend in disaster.<br />\nBut oddly enough, we did get to Phoenix. I figure I'm a free man, at least if Paul<br />\nwould wake up. Ten minutes later, to my enormous relief, I see him in the station with<br />\nsuitcase in hand, so I know the ordeal is pretty much over. I saunter over to him and<br />\nglibly remark, \"Well, good luck, Paul, sure was nice to ride with you.\" \"Great,cowboy,<br />\nsure ya don't want to stop off in Phoenix with me for a couple days, I'll show you the<br />\ngood spots.\" \"Well Paul, I'd like .to, but I've gotta meet my brother, maybe next time.\"<br />\nThe rest of the trip to Santa Fe was a breeze. Most of the partyers were too crashed<br />\nout, sick, or plain scared to create any ruckus, so we just rode the Magic Bus on in. My<br />\nbrother met me at the dingy Greyhound station and handed me a beer as we waved<br />\ngoodbye to the Magic Bus. And that was the first moment of freedom and safety this<br />\ntattered cowboy extracted from Greyhound, Inc.<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022*\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022411.\u2022<br /><br />\n.page 10/news-letter/february 18, 1977<br /><br />\n...<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix<br /><br />\n'<br />\n44111111111<br />\n.<br />\n.4111111111.<br />\n0<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n.<br />\n11111111. .411111.1110.<br /><br />\nSenior Class Film Series<br /><br />\npresents<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\npresents<br /><br />\nWORkINCic<br />\nTO<br />\n'MAVEN<br />\nIASSCI\"S<br /><br />\nELIO PETRI'S<br /><br />\n11HE<br />\nCLASS<br />\nBIDES 11:1<br />\nHEA111/1EN<br />\nStarring GIAN MARIA VOLONTE<br />\nand MARIANGELA MELATO<br />\nFrom NEW UNE CINEMA<br /><br />\nBEST FILM, Cannes Film Festival<br /><br />\nI.<br /><br />\nELLIOTT KAMEN MC.71<br />\nA WA AJICHANDS RUA<br />\nAMES \"FAREIVE1.4 AO'LOVELY'<br />\nRQaWETAUTCNINA \u2022 CHARLOTTE EAMPLAY8 \u2022 AWNIMAM \u2022STUN4 MK MAWS<br />\n,<br />\nsioac ANINONY ZERIE \u2022 NAM DEAN MUM tra.to'<br />\nRUCXNENEEN<br />\nleavaa Ofeirff DORASam.11111<br />\naeivei vo..:us ELLIOTT XAS7N\u00a311 \u2022 MEW<br />\n1<br />\nAz c alawn=<br />\nCHANDLEN<br />\nWINOND<br />\nsf<br />\nwt..* p MAD ZELAG DOODMAN \u2022'go<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022 A.\u2022-\u2022\u2022<br />\n,<br />\n41i<br />\nDAVID santE\u2022.44 aynapes,MUM 411 4IC MOON 15,-.<br /><br />\nintent<br /><br />\n\"VOLONTE IS FIRST-RATE!\"<br />\nCost/NEW YORK MAD<br /><br />\n\"BRILLIANTLY DIRECTED!\"<br />\nHerridge/NEW YORK POST<br /><br />\n\"ONE OF THE FUNNIEST<br />\nSEDUCTION SCENES EVER\"<br />\nStoop/AFTER DARK<br /><br />\n\"ELECTRICITY, VIGOR &amp; PASSION!\"<br /><br />\nFRi. &amp; SAT.<br /><br />\nFEb. 18 &amp; 19<br /><br />\nWolf/CUE<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nAdmissioN $1.00<br /><br />\nShaffer 3<br /><br />\nSaturday, Feb.1 9<br /><br />\nTnvim,<br /><br />\n8:00&amp; 10:00<br />\n5.75<br /><br />\nT4*-40-40-\u20224410-40-.1*-\u2022\u2022-\u2022-\u20224*-40-411*4<br />\n7:30 Pt 10:00 PM<br /><br />\n*\u2022:\u2022:\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nPLACE: SHRIVER HALL<br /><br />\nI ADMISSION: $1.00<br />\nNkk ScREwEd A3i1<br /><br />\n\"BREATHTAKING<br />\n...EXUBERANTLY FUNNY!<br />\nWatching All Screwed Up isto be witness<br />\nto a giant talent:<br />\nVincent Canby/ NEW YORK TIMES<br /><br />\nTHE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT'S ASSOC.<br />\nTHE GRAD CLUB THE JUNIOR CLASS<br /><br />\nINTERICION<br />\nDANIC<br /><br />\nBELLY<br />\nDANCER<br />\nARISTEA'<br /><br />\n\"A BRILLIANT MOVIE<br />\nthat must be seen several times!\"<br /><br />\nRex Reed<br /><br />\nGREEK<br />\nBAND<br />\n:<br />\n+GeRECIAN<br />\nODYSSEY<br /><br />\n\"UPROARIOUSLY<br />\nFUNNY<br />\nA strong<br /><br />\nentertaining,daring film from Wertmuller!\"<br />\nWilliam Wolf / CUE MAGAZINE<br /><br />\n\"INCREDIBLY FUNNY,\"<br />\nSan Francisco Chronicle<br /><br />\nBEER<br /><br />\nf5t LIGHT<br />\n50t DARK<br />\n40 te MICHELOB<br /><br />\nWINE<br /><br />\nLINA WERTMULLER'S<br /><br />\nALL SCREWED LIP<br />\nlii<br /><br />\nSENIORS<br /><br />\nNEW LINE CINEMA<br /><br />\nFriday, Feb. 1 8<br /><br />\nPG,<br /><br />\nSUN DAY<br />\nFEB. 20-th<br /><br />\n$1 es) Sfacien+<br />\n01-f9 Other<br /><br />\nFREE<br />\n945 -to I<br />\nMUNCH1E5<br />\nGLASS PAVILION-HOMEWOOD CAMPUS<br />\n\"YN5 HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br /><br />\nfebruary 18, 1977/news-letter/page 11<br /><br />\nGodEREy's: 110T<br /><br />\nSTUFF<br /><br />\n-It's no secret that Godfrey's Steer and Beer on Greenrnount Avenue is high on this rag's list of fave rave<br />\nbars.

But get there soon if you want<br />\nto catch some of the old magic, because rumor has it that<br />\nHOPKINS'<br />\n-will be purchasing Godfrey's in the near future in Order to quell the unmanageable crowds at the<br />\nRathskellar. It was also said that Godfrey's would be renamed Rathskellar East.<br />\n\"We found that it was impossible to snag a quick beer on Friday or Saturday night at the Rat,\"<br />\ncommented a middle range administration official.\" \"Godfrey's was dirt cheap and it filled our Rathskellar<br />\nexpansion requirements,\" he continued.<br />\nAccording to the recent scuttlebutt, plans are now underway for the construction of an underground<br />\nshuttle 'from Levering Hall to the basement of Godfrey's so that students don't have to contend with<br />\n\"Menacing city forces.\"<br />\n\"We don't think Hopkins students should have to consort with Baltimore's rabble if they don't want to,\"<br />\nexplained the confidential source.<br />\nHopkins police will provide the security for the tunnel operation.

The Diplomats<br />\ncontrolled the tip, taking the ball<br />\ndown court setting up for an<br />\noffensive play. F&amp;M missed their<br />\nshot and Dan Kopcza was in<br />\nPosition for the rebound. Finston<br />\nmissed the Jays opening shot, but<br />\non the ensuing defensive play,<br />\nguard Scheinfeld forced a jump<br />\nby tying up a Diplomat offender.<br />\nAndy won the toss up, sending<br />\nthe ball to 6'8\" Uhler who hit on<br />\na beautiful five foot turnaround<br />\nJump shot for the 2-0 lead.<br />\nThe visiting opponents quickly<br /><br />\nInstant replay!<br /><br />\ntied the score off a fine passing<br />\nconnection from sophomores<br />\nKen Hopson and Mark Worley<br />\nwhich resulted in a driving layup.<br />\nUhler broke the tie by sinking a<br />\nfoul shot, but a short from<br />\nDiplomat forward John Boyer<br />\nput his team on top 4-3. The<br />\nscore seesawed back and forth<br />\nuntil consecutive buckets by<br /><br />\nUhler and guard Kabat gave the<br />\nJays a three point lead at the six<br />\nminute mark of the first half.<br />\nBut the lead did not last long<br />\nfor the Blue Jays. The Diplomat<br />\noffense took over outscoring the<br />\nJay offense 15-4 putting the tally<br />\nin their favor 23-15 halfway<br />\nthrough the twenty minute<br />\nperiod. The rest of the first half<br /><br />\nsaw the Diplomats catch fire,<br />\nhitting every shot in sight. Junior<br />\nDon Marsh and sophomore Bob<br />\nManaskie led the team in scoring<br />\nin the first half with 14 points<br />\nand 10 points, respectively. Uhler<br />\npoured in 13 points for the Jays,<br />\nbut they found themselves down<br />\n44-27 at the end of the first half.<br />\nThe Diplomats also<br />\noutrebounded the Jays 24-10.<br />\nThe second half saw F&amp;M<br />\ncontinue to build up their lead<br />\nuntil they had a 60-35 advantage<br />\nwith fourteen minutes left in the<br />\ngame. From that point on the<br />\nJays chipped away bit by bit at<br />\nthe Diplomat lead.<br />\nApparently, F&amp;M figured that<br />\nthe Blue Jays had given up on the<br />\ngame's outcome, so they replaced<br />\ntheir first string team with their<br />\nscrubs. But the Jays wouldn't<br />\nquit. Offensive surges led by<br />\nPhipps, Finston, and Scheinfeld<br />\nput the Jays to within four<br />\npoints of the Diplomats.<br />\nUnfortunately for the Jays, their<br />\nsurge was too little too late and<br />\nthe Jays went down to defeat<br />\n80-73.<br />\nThe contest against Haverford<br />\nwas a fairly even affair. Neither<br />\nteam could amass a substantial<br />\nlead through the first half and<br />\nthe Jays went into the locker<br />\nroom with a slim 43-42<br />\nadvantage.<br />\nHaverford, however, was able<br />\nto pull away in the second<br />\ntwenty minutes.
