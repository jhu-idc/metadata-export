These charges<br />\nhave been made against about<br />\nten percent of the nation's<br />\ncolleges and universities. WEAL,<br />\nthe Women's Equity Action<br />\nLeague, has campaigned against<br />\nsuch discrimination and has<br />\ntaken action in certain cases.<br />\nHEW has been investigating<br />\nthese charges and pressuring<br />\nsome insititutions.<br />\nNepotism clauses, which<br />\nusually have meant that the wife<br />\nof a husband and wife team of<br />\nacademics has not been able to<br />\nhold academic rank, are under<br />\nattack.

A University senate is what is needed, not<br />\na student senate. If the student senate does come into<br />\nexistence, its first action should be to demand that faculty<br />\nrepresentatives be elected, and that the body take the<br />\nplace of the faculty general assembly. That group has no<br />\ndelegated authority, but its opinions are usually followed.<br />\nThe undergraduates turned down a governance plan<br />\nnearly a year ago, and so far no one has suggested an<br />\nalternative. The Student Council should take its student<br />\nsenate idea one step further and come up with a viable<br />\ngovernance alternative, perhaps holding its own<br />\nreferendum so that the University could get a chance to<br />\nvote once again. Dean Benton is appointing his governance<br />\ncommittee despite the undergraduate's disapproval. Maybe<br />\nthe Student Council could suggest its plan despite Dean<br />\nBenton's disapproval.<br />\n<br />\nMuller speech<br />\nProvost Steven Muller, in a Wednesday talk on \"The<br />\nUniversity As a Humanizing Force,\" made a number of<br />\npeculiar assertions that should cause those \u2022 who seek<br />\nUniversity improvements to wonder about someone widely<br />\nrumored to be under consideration for the Hopkins<br />\npresidency. Among other gems, Muller compared<br />\nnon-administrators to French Barons, called for more<br />\npower for his own already strong office and stressed the<br />\nunimportance of community ties. In addition, he<br />\ncommented, \"Hopkins cannot and should not match such<br />\nschools as Swarthmore, Reed and Haverford in finding<br />\none's self.\" While the meaning of this is a little difficult to<br />\nfathom, he apparently meant it as a not-so-subtle hint that<br />\nthe administration does not really intend to improve<br />\nundergraduate education. Obviously, the Provost has no<br />\ndesire to make the University a humanizing force for<br />\ncommunity residents or undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI agree with most of the<br />\nsentiments expressed in the<br />\nrecent letter from the Iranian<br />\nstudents, and wish to add the<br />\nfollowing: The extravagant<br />\ncelebration beginning on<br />\nOctober 13 marks the 2,500th<br />\nanniversity of the founding of<br />\nthe Persian Empire. Yet every<br />\neffort has been made to make<br />\nthis a celebration of inferiority.<br />\nMonths ago the Shah hired a<br />\ngroup of British engineers to set<br />\nup a new tele-commuilications<br />\nsystem (when he has a pool of<br />\nqualified engineers at Arya-mehr<br />\nUniversity in Tehran); he gave<br />\nout the contract for all street<br />\ndecorations to a firm in Great<br />\nBritian (when artistic talent<br />\nabounds in Iran); he hired<br />\nMaxim's of Paris to provide all<br />\nthe food and wine for the<br />\nfestivities (when Persian food is<br />\ndelicious and the wines of Shiraz<br />\nLre excellent); he hired a French<br />\ninferior decorator to \"do\" the<br />\nlavish tents ill which the guests<br />\nwill be housed and also hired a<br />\nFrench fashion house to design<br />\nthe uniforms to be worn by the<br />\nmaids, waiters, etc. Even the<br />\nfireworks are French.

Stephens<br />\nWhen President Nixon pulled the plug last<br />\nAugust 15th, he mentioned that his new game<br />\nplan was the most drastic economic move in four<br />\ndecades. In fact Nixon's measures are a direct<br />\nreplay of those made by British Prime Minister<br />\nRamsay MacDonald. In September 1931, at a<br />\ntime when the pound sterling had the same<br />\ngeneral relationship to world trade that the dollar<br />\nheld for the last quarter-century, MacDonald,<br />\nacting under circumstances like those facing<br />\nNixon, let the value of the pound \"float\" free of<br />\na fixed price for gold. The immediate result was<br />\nthe Great Depression.<br />\nThe technical reasons for an immediate<br />\ndepression-threat are elementary. All capitalist<br />\nworld trade depands upon the negotiability of<br />\nletters of credit and bills of exchange proper in<br />\nthe currencies of both the buyer and the. seller.<br />\nConsidering the volume of world trade<br />\nconducted on credit, if the relative prices of the<br />\nprincipal currencies fluctuate widely within a<br />\nperiod of thirty days, the risk of loss to buyer,<br />\nseller, and bankers, because of currency<br />\nfluctuations, causes a collapse of credit and a<br />\ncessation of the major part of world trade as a<br />\nwhole.<br />\nAccording to the New York Times, in the last<br />\n90 days Japanese exports have declined 50<br />\npercent, in the last two weeks 90 percent. As the<br />\nshrill cries of \"depression\" heard from visiting<br />\nfinance ministers in Washington last week at the<br />\nInternational Monetary Fund meeting testify to,<br />\nFrance, West Germany, Holland, etc. are not far<br />\nbehind Japan.<br />\nSinking Ship<br />\nLike rats abandoning a sinking ship, former<br />\nliberal advocates and originators of the wage<br />\nprice freeze, such as Senator Jacob Javits,<br />\nsmelling a coming depression, take an<br />\nindependent critical stand, leaving the Nixon<br />\nRegime to go down with the ship. Nixon and his<br />\ncronies, incapable of grasping the real<br />\nsignificance of present economic events, can<br />\nsmell a political skunk. Therefore, in the past few<br />\nC. B. Stephens is a member of the Baltimore Labor<br />\nCommittee<br />\n<br />\nweeks the administration has toned down its<br />\nhard stance on the 10 percent surtax on foreign<br />\nimports. But like the rhetoric college graduates<br />\nhear at commencement exercises, Nixon's toning<br />\ndown is high in aspirations and low on<br />\nperformance. And the only concrete results of<br />\nthe IMF meeting was a reaffirmation by all<br />\nparticipants to crush the organized and<br />\nunorganized labor movements of their respective<br />\ncountries. And the dollar floats on.<br />\nThe economic events of the past 90 days have<br />\ntotally discredited every leading economist from<br />\nPaul Samuelson of ECO 202 fame to the<br />\nso-called Marxist economists Paul Sweezy and<br />\nErnest Mandel. One has just to leaf through<br />\nSamuelson's standard text to see that he doesn't<br />\neven deal with the subject of \"depression crises,\"<br />\nlet alone admit that one can occur. While Mandel<br />\nand Sweezy have only implied what Samuelson<br />\nand his ilk explicitly state as an act of faith in the<br />\neternal nature of the \"built in stabilizers\"<br />\npreventing precisely what is now occurring, they<br />\ndo join with their \"comrades\" in offering the<br />\ncredulous \"explanation\" that U.S. post-1965<br />\nmonetary difficulties reflect the emergence of<br />\nWestern Europe and Japan as new economic<br />\n\"super powers,\" duelling the weakening U.S.<br />\neconomy to death in the world-trade market.<br />\nMore contemptible nonsense was never written<br />\non this subject.<br />\nThe entire development of Western Europe<br />\nand Japan during the past quarter-century has<br />\nbeen based on massive loans to world trade by<br />\nthe U.S., and on the role of the U.S. dollar as the<br />\nprincipal reserve currency and rock of stability<br />\non which an orderly growth of world trade could<br />\nbe premised. Since the first threat of inflationary<br />\ncrisis, which confronted the dollar immediately<br />\nfollowing World War II, U.S. money-managers<br />\nhave correctly and repeatedly warned the U.S.<br />\nPresidents and Congresses that any instability in<br />\nthe dollar would wreck the international<br />\nmonetary system and bring the entire capitalist<br />\nworld down into a new depression.<br />\nIndeed, the very deficits which the dollar has<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br />\n<br />\n\fOCT. 15, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nbluegrass<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nIt's the big time now for<br />\ncountry music.

With this background<br />\nof the easy contact and<br />\nrecognition of the audience<br />\nBromberg seemed out of place<br />\nWith in the spotlight.

Whenever he<br />\nbecomes excited, as when<br />\nmaking a point in lecture, his<br />\nwords are rushed,- and his<br />\nthroaty voice becomes strained<br />\nto the point of breaking.<br />\nGreene, who came to Hopkins<br />\nin 1966, after fourteen years of<br />\nteaching undergraduates at larger<br />\nschools, sympathizes with the<br />\nundergraduates here.<br />\nHe feels that students often<br />\nwander through Hopkins<br />\nWithout making any serious<br /><br />\ncommitment to academics.<br />\n\"I really don't see any point<br />\nin taking shopping-market<br />\ncourses, whereby students pile<br />\nup credits until they have the<br />\nnecessary 120 points to<br />\ngraduate,\" Greene stated.<br />\nHe has recommended that<br />\nHistory institute a four-year<br />\nprogram, where students would<br />\ntake three courses each semester.<br />\nThis is not to say that Greene<br />\nexpects all undergraduates to<br />\nknow what they want to do in<br />\nlife. \"I'm really in sympathy<br />\nwith students who wander<br />\naround, but for the student who<br />\nknows what he wants to do, I<br />\nthink the structure should offer<br />\na really concentrated,<br />\nstreamlined education.\"<br />\nHe describes his entry into his<br />\nfield of American Colonial and<br />\nRevolutionary studies as \"really<br />\na series of accidents.

The meeting<br />\nwas organizational; a decision<br />\nwas made to expand the<br />\nC ommittee's present<br />\nst udent -administration<br />\nmembership to include Evening<br />\nCollege, worker and faculty<br />\nrepresentatives. The Committee<br />\nPlans to invite Macke officers to<br />\nthe second meeting of the<br />\nexpanded committee.<br />\nChanges<br />\nSC President Bates had been<br />\ncharged by University<br />\nV ice -President for<br />\nAdministration Benjamin Willis<br />\nWith the creation of a committee<br />\nWith wide University<br />\nmembership to suggest changes<br />\nin the cafeteria. Bates had been a<br />\nboycott proponent earlier in the<br />\nschool year, but had dropped<br />\nthe boycott idea when the SC<br />\nrefused to endorse it.<br />\nSince that time, the boycott<br />\nhas been episodic, spontaneous<br />\nand essentially leaderless.<br />\nRecently, the \"alternative food<br />\nservices\" that students had<br />\nbrought to the doors of Levering<br />\nHall have faded away.<br />\nSelling Stuff<br />\nThe cafeteria has been busy,<br />\nand sales have increased<br />\nnoticeably since late September.<br />\nMacke General Manager John<br />\nBarnett denied any conflicts<br />\nWith the independent vendors.<br />\n\"We know that there was a truck<br />\nselling stuff, and they had to be<br />\ntaking money from us,\" said<br />\nBarnett. But the truck, like the<br />\nOther alternatives, has stopped<br />\nselling at Levering.<br /><br />\nAccording to Barnett, the<br />\ncompany has no plans at this<br />\ntime to make major changes in<br />\nthe service. \"But I don't want to<br />\nsay that the door is closed,\"<br />\nBarnett added. \"We're in a<br />\nposition to run any kind of a<br />\nfood service.\"<br />\nFor the operation to change<br />\nfrom machines to manual<br /><br />\nLevering Cafeteria Manager<br />\npreparation, Barnett said, the<br />\nUniversity would have to<br />\nnegotiate with Macke to<br />\ndetermine distribution of costs<br />\nof renovation and other<br />\nproprietary details. \"It would<br />\nmean another contract,\" noted<br />\nBarnett.<br />\nNo Requests<br />\nCompany has<br />\nMacke<br />\nThe<br />\nreceived no requests for even<br />\nminor changes from the<br />\nUniversity Administration since<br />\nthe beginning of student protests<br />\nover the cafeteria.<br />\nAt the first meeting of the<br />\nexpanded Committee on Food<br />\nServices, Director of Business<br />\nServices Donald Bickert is to<br />\npresent a report on past food<br />\nservices and the University's<br />\npresent needs.<br /><br />\ndecision, but I actually backed<br />\nI into it, when I was a Fulbright<br />\nScholar to England, and had a<br />\nchance to study the archives.\"<br />\nOutstanding Department<br />\nThe programs in American<br />\nand European History for<br />\nHopkins undergraduates are<br />\namong the best in the country,<br />\nGreene asserts. \"I think that,<br />\nwhile perhaps a few structural<br />\nchanges are necessary for the<br />\ndepartment, I doubt that there is<br />\na better place for history major.<br />\n\"Probably, a student at<br />\nSwarthmore or Oberlin, where<br />\nprofessors devote all their time<br />\nto undergraduates, could receive<br />\nmore personal attention,\" Green<br />\nallows.<br />\nBut the History department<br />\nhere is moving towards,<br />\nminimizing barriers between<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents. \"There seems to be a<br />\ngeneral agreement within the<br />\ndepartment that, if first-year<br />\ngrad students can learn with<br />\nfourth-year students, than<br />\nundergraduates can learn with<br />\ngraduate students,\" he notes.<br />\nDespite the loss of Prof. Hugh<br />\nDavis Graham, Greene forsees<br />\ncloser relationships between<br />\n.Hopkins and Morgan State.<br />\n\"They have some tine people in<br />\nBlack History, and not only in<br /><br />\nBlack American History.\"<br />\nAfter spending last year on<br />\nleave to the Institute for<br />\nAdvanced Study at Princeton,<br />\nGreene is finishing a book on the<br />\nsubject matter for this year's<br />\ncourse, The Causal Pattern of<br />\nthe American Revolution. He is<br />\nattempting to shift the emphasis<br />\nof much modern scholarship on<br />\nideology, to what he considers<br />\nmore substantial issues.<br />\n\"There has been an<br />\nextraordinary resurgence of<br /><br />\ninterest in the era of the<br />\nAmerican Revolution,\" he says.<br />\n\"Over the past decade and a<br />\nhalf, there has been some<br />\nexcellent research, and the field<br />\nhas now attracted some of the<br />\nbest young scholars.\"<br />\nWould Greene like to begin<br />\nagain, to study another period?<br />\n\"No,\" he says. \"After spending<br />\nalmost twenty years in this field,<br />\nI realize how little I actually<br />\nknow about what I am<br />\nstudying.\"<br /><br />\nStudent Increase Challenged<br />\nBy LINDA SHARP<br />\nWith political science<br />\nprofessor Rick Pfeffer's presence<br />\nadding some spirit to Monday's<br />\nmeeting, the Student Council<br />\nsupported the upcoming China<br />\nDay, and set up committees to<br />\nstudy President Eisenhower's<br />\nproposed enrollment increase<br />\nand the extent to which the SC<br />\nshould cooperate with APL's<br />\npublic relations efforts.<br />\nThe Council's Social.<br />\nCommittee has been considering<br />\nsponsoring a trip to the Applied<br />\nPhysics Laboratory which would<br />\nbe completely funded by the<br />\nAPL, including a free lunch for<br />\nvisitors.<br />\nPfeffer asserted, \"This would<br />\nbe providing APL a cover for<br />\ndoing its PR,\" promoting a<br />\ndebate that resulted in the<br />\nestablishment of an investigation<br />\ncommittee to be led by Andrew<br />\nSavitz.<br />\nThe purpose of this<br />\ncommittee is to explore the<br />\nUniversity's relationship to the<br />\nmilitary -industrial complex.<br />\n\"We're the largest University<br />\ndefense contractor in the<br />\nnation,\" Treasurer Dick<br />\nHeddleson explained.

The idea certainly has merit. A larger body might<br />\nsmother the personality conflicts that so often disrupt the<br />\nCouncil's business. The greater representation and the<br />\nunity of the graduate and undergraduate voice might mean<br />\nthat this body would be taken more seriously.<br />\nBut it seems that the Council is expending its efforts in<br />\nthe wrong direction. While a student senate might be a<br />\nslight improvement, there will be no major change in the<br />\nundergraduate's position on this campus until authority is<br />\ndelegated to a representative body which includes<br />\nundergraduates. A University senate is what is needed, not<br />\na student senate. If the student senate does come into<br />\nexistence, its first action should be to demand that faculty<br />\nrepresentatives be elected, and that the body take the<br />\nplace of the faculty general assembly. That group has no<br />\ndelegated authority, but its opinions are usually followed.<br />\nThe undergraduates turned down a governance plan<br />\nnearly a year ago, and so far no one has suggested an<br />\nalternative. The Student Council should take its student<br />\nsenate idea one step further and come up with a viable<br />\ngovernance alternative, perhaps holding its own<br />\nreferendum so that the University could get a chance to<br />\nvote once again. Dean Benton is appointing his governance<br />\ncommittee despite the undergraduate's disapproval. Maybe<br />\nthe Student Council could suggest its plan despite Dean<br />\nBenton's disapproval.<br /><br />\nMuller speech<br />\nProvost Steven Muller, in a Wednesday talk on \"The<br />\nUniversity As a Humanizing Force,\" made a number of<br />\npeculiar assertions that should cause those \u2022 who seek<br />\nUniversity improvements to wonder about someone widely<br />\nrumored to be under consideration for the Hopkins<br />\npresidency. Among other gems, Muller compared<br />\nnon-administrators to French Barons, called for more<br />\npower for his own already strong office and stressed the<br />\nunimportance of community ties. In addition, he<br />\ncommented, \"Hopkins cannot and should not match such<br />\nschools as Swarthmore, Reed and Haverford in finding<br />\none's self.\" While the meaning of this is a little difficult to<br />\nfathom, he apparently meant it as a not-so-subtle hint that<br />\nthe administration does not really intend to improve<br />\nundergraduate education. Obviously, the Provost has no<br />\ndesire to make the University a humanizing force for<br />\ncommunity residents or undergraduates.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI agree with most of the<br />\nsentiments expressed in the<br />\nrecent letter from the Iranian<br />\nstudents, and wish to add the<br />\nfollowing: The extravagant<br />\ncelebration beginning on<br />\nOctober 13 marks the 2,500th<br />\nanniversity of the founding of<br />\nthe Persian Empire.

Stephens<br />\nWhen President Nixon pulled the plug last<br />\nAugust 15th, he mentioned that his new game<br />\nplan was the most drastic economic move in four<br />\ndecades. In fact Nixon's measures are a direct<br />\nreplay of those made by British Prime Minister<br />\nRamsay MacDonald. In September 1931, at a<br />\ntime when the pound sterling had the same<br />\ngeneral relationship to world trade that the dollar<br />\nheld for the last quarter-century, MacDonald,<br />\nacting under circumstances like those facing<br />\nNixon, let the value of the pound \"float\" free of<br />\na fixed price for gold. The immediate result was<br />\nthe Great Depression.<br />\nThe technical reasons for an immediate<br />\ndepression-threat are elementary. All capitalist<br />\nworld trade depands upon the negotiability of<br />\nletters of credit and bills of exchange proper in<br />\nthe currencies of both the buyer and the. seller.<br />\nConsidering the volume of world trade<br />\nconducted on credit, if the relative prices of the<br />\nprincipal currencies fluctuate widely within a<br />\nperiod of thirty days, the risk of loss to buyer,<br />\nseller, and bankers, because of currency<br />\nfluctuations, causes a collapse of credit and a<br />\ncessation of the major part of world trade as a<br />\nwhole.<br />\nAccording to the New York Times, in the last<br />\n90 days Japanese exports have declined 50<br />\npercent, in the last two weeks 90 percent. As the<br />\nshrill cries of \"depression\" heard from visiting<br />\nfinance ministers in Washington last week at the<br />\nInternational Monetary Fund meeting testify to,<br />\nFrance, West Germany, Holland, etc. are not far<br />\nbehind Japan.<br />\nSinking Ship<br />\nLike rats abandoning a sinking ship, former<br />\nliberal advocates and originators of the wage<br />\nprice freeze, such as Senator Jacob Javits,<br />\nsmelling a coming depression, take an<br />\nindependent critical stand, leaving the Nixon<br />\nRegime to go down with the ship. Nixon and his<br />\ncronies, incapable of grasping the real<br />\nsignificance of present economic events, can<br />\nsmell a political skunk. Therefore, in the past few<br />\nC. B. Stephens is a member of the Baltimore Labor<br />\nCommittee<br /><br />\nweeks the administration has toned down its<br />\nhard stance on the 10 percent surtax on foreign<br />\nimports. But like the rhetoric college graduates<br />\nhear at commencement exercises, Nixon's toning<br />\ndown is high in aspirations and low on<br />\nperformance. And the only concrete results of<br />\nthe IMF meeting was a reaffirmation by all<br />\nparticipants to crush the organized and<br />\nunorganized labor movements of their respective<br />\ncountries. And the dollar floats on.<br />\nThe economic events of the past 90 days have<br />\ntotally discredited every leading economist from<br />\nPaul Samuelson of ECO 202 fame to the<br />\nso-called Marxist economists Paul Sweezy and<br />\nErnest Mandel. One has just to leaf through<br />\nSamuelson's standard text to see that he doesn't<br />\neven deal with the subject of \"depression crises,\"<br />\nlet alone admit that one can occur. While Mandel<br />\nand Sweezy have only implied what Samuelson<br />\nand his ilk explicitly state as an act of faith in the<br />\neternal nature of the \"built in stabilizers\"<br />\npreventing precisely what is now occurring, they<br />\ndo join with their \"comrades\" in offering the<br />\ncredulous \"explanation\" that U.S. post-1965<br />\nmonetary difficulties reflect the emergence of<br />\nWestern Europe and Japan as new economic<br />\n\"super powers,\" duelling the weakening U.S.<br />\neconomy to death in the world-trade market.<br />\nMore contemptible nonsense was never written<br />\non this subject.<br />\nThe entire development of Western Europe<br />\nand Japan during the past quarter-century has<br />\nbeen based on massive loans to world trade by<br />\nthe U.S., and on the role of the U.S. dollar as the<br />\nprincipal reserve currency and rock of stability<br />\non which an orderly growth of world trade could<br />\nbe premised. Since the first threat of inflationary<br />\ncrisis, which confronted the dollar immediately<br />\nfollowing World War II, U.S. money-managers<br />\nhave correctly and repeatedly warned the U.S.<br />\nPresidents and Congresses that any instability in<br />\nthe dollar would wreck the international<br />\nmonetary system and bring the entire capitalist<br />\nworld down into a new depression.<br />\nIndeed, the very deficits which the dollar has<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br /><br />\nOCT. 15, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nbluegrass<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nIt's the big time now for<br />\ncountry music.

He has<br />\nplayed on around 15 albums,<br />\nand has four of his own,<br />\nincluding one on Capitol that<br />\nhas sold over 50,000 copies,<br />\nwhich is a lot for bluegrass. He<br />\nhas been on the same stage with<br />\nthe very best musicians, played<br />\nto thousands live, millions on<br />\nregional TV and radio. Now he<br />\nwas playing to two fat ladies<br />\ndoing a tired little reel near the<br />\nstage. He would come up to the<br />\none microphone for the<br />\nharmonies and the breaks, and<br />\nthen hover in the backgournd as<br />\nFrankie \u2022 Short, a wiry little<br />\nfellow in striped shirt and a<br />\nstring tic, sang the lead vocals<br />\nand played mandolin. During the<br />\nslow songs, more couples would<br />\ndrift onto the dance floor.<br />\nMarried couples out for the<br />\nnight, workers from the nearby<br />\nGM plant trying to score, a<br />\nmiddle-aged man pawing at a<br />\nyoung girl in white; everyone<br />\nwas a little drunk. \"If ya got any<br />\nrequests, just write them down<br />\non a five dollar bill and send<br />\nthem on up,\" Frankic joked to<br />\nthe small crowd. Walter Hensely<br />\nand his group have been together<br />\nfor eight years.<br />\nWhen the band stopped<br />\nplaying to take their 15 minute<br />\nbreaks, no one seemed to notice,<br />\nsince the jukebox went on<br /><br />\nautomatically with the sounds of<br />\nMarty Robbins and the Osmond<br />\nBrothers. Jimmy Hensley, Walt's<br />\nbrother and the guitar player of<br />\nthe group, went over to talk to<br />\nsome visitors about their music.<br />\n\"Places like this disgust me,\"<br />\nJimmy said. In his late thirties,<br />\nhe works for an electrical<br />\nengineering firm and noted that<br />\nthe group can only get together<br />\non weekends. \"No one<br />\nappreciates the music here, all<br />\nthey want to do is dance,\" he<br />\nadded. On Sundays they play at<br />\nStabile's in Highlandtown where'<br />\nthey feel there are more genuine<br />\nbluegrass fans.<br />\nThe group is pressured often<br />\nby their audience to play<br />\ncountry music. \"I don't like<br />\nmuch country music,\" Jimmy<br />\nsaid, \"It's just a lot of<br />\ntear-jerkers for people to cry<br />\ninto their beers.\"<br />\n\"At the festivals, we go on<br />\nafter around 20 country bands<br />\nas a sort of change of pace<br />\nmusic,\" he said, with just the<br />\nfaintest trace of bitterness.<br />\nAlthough the members of the<br />\ngroup come from Virginia and<br />\nWest Virginia, they first achieved<br />\nsome fame in the early 60's on a<br />\nCincinatti TV program, but they<br />\nhave never yet made the big<br />\ntime.<br />\n\"You need a gimmick to get<br />\nahead in this business,\" he said,<br />\nfinishing his beer before<br />\nreturning to the stage and to the<br />\nmen, a little drunker now,<br />\nhollering from the tables in the<br />\nback.<br /><br />\nfolk<br />\nBy MICHAEL WEISSMAN<br />\nA longhair down the aisle<br />\nWhispered to his friend that<br />\nthose two guys on stage had<br />\npeed next to him in the<br />\nbathroom just before the<br />\nconcert began.<br />\nThose two guys were David<br />\nBromberg with his semetic<br />\npeck-a-boo hairdo and his one<br />\nman back-up band, the<br />\nFrustrations. The audience,<br />\nabout four hundred<br />\nlumber-jacketed longhairs, let<br />\ndown their ponytails to listen to<br />\nfirst Bromberg, and then Doc<br />\n,Watson at the Marven Theater at<br />\nGW last Saturday night.<br />\nThe tone of the evening was<br />\nset by the unexpected<br />\nappearance of those normal<br />\nlooking guys on stage and<br />\nreinforced by their style of play.<br />\nBromberg's songs are funny and<br />\nquick just like his playing. He<br />\nswings his hips like old rockers<br />\nand contorts his face to the time<br />\nof the fast, wide-ranging licks on<br />\nthe guitar.<br />\nSad Song<br />\nBromberg started out as a folk<br />\nsinger but progressed into the<br />\nvirtuousity that has won even<br />\nDylan's respect, and humors the<br />\nquick-witted up-dated folk fans<br />\nof today. With this background<br />\nof the easy contact and<br />\nrecognition of the audience<br />\nBromberg seemed out of place<br />\nWith in the spotlight. He wanted<br />\na crowd who weren't satisfied to<br />\nSit back and just listen as they<br />\ndid with their super-duper<br />\nstereos, but real people who<br />\nWould react to the music in the<br /><br />\nsame tempo that it was being<br />\nplayed. He wanted to force the<br />\nthoughts of uncouth Shindig<br />\nshows and organized hootnanies<br />\nfrom people's minds, but it was<br />\nhard.<br />\nThis Most modern of quirks in<br />\nthe audience made Bromberg's<br />\nbest song, not his usual fast and<br />\nfunny ones. In those everyone<br />\nlaughed at the appropriate places<br />\nand applauded his vigorous and<br />\nexciting runs up and down the<br />\ninstrument. Instead it was a<br />\nquiet, sad song about a girl that<br />\nhe said was in the crowd that<br />\nSaturday night. The guitar was<br />\nmore mellow, more in the<br />\nbackground; the slick words gave<br />\nway to real emotion. They came<br />\nout from behind the curly black<br />\nhair that hid his face behind the<br />\nmicrophone. It was almost as if<br />\nhe was afraid to show his face to<br />\nthat girl in the back rows just<br />\nhow intensely he had been<br />\naffected. When he was done we,<br />\nthe audience, didn't know quite<br />\nwhat to do. A big burst of<br />\nclapping would have seemed so<br />\nout of place after the feelings<br />\njust put on display. Anyway we<br />\nhad become a bunch of<br />\ngrown-adolescents who all<br />\nremembered someone who had<br />\naffected ourselves in just such a<br />\nmagical way, rather than the<br />\naudience who could just sit back<br />\nand listen, not take part too.<br />\nMisplayed Note<br />\nTo bring the tone of his part<br />\nof the concert to its previous<br />\nincarnation Bromberg tried to<br />\ndraw us out some more.<br />\nBromberg wandered out of the<br /><br />\nDoc Watson and Merle<br />\nmiddle aged, blind folk singer<br />\nspotlight and began a song about<br />\nreinforced the easy-going tone<br />\nJericho and its walls. He left out<br />\ntelling us that he loved us a<br />\nwords that we were to fill in, but<br />\nbunch and suggesting that we act<br />\nwe didn't. Instead he did, with<br />\nas if we were in his living room.<br />\nthe music of his guitar outlining<br />\nthe words of the old minstrel<br />\nSnap<br />\nsong.<br />\nThat was exactly the way it<br />\nHe ended his concert with a<br />\nworked out, but at the start the<br />\nmisplayed note that was totally<br />\nh<br />\nDoc, seemed a little out of<br />\nincorrect, but he had us on his<br />\nsorts, unsure who we were.<br />\nside now, so it didn't make any<br />\nMaybe it was because he was<br />\ndifference.<br />\nThen Doc Watson came on<br />\ntired, maybe because the man<br />\nwho gave him his proverbial big<br />\nstage led by his son Merle,just as<br />\nbreak was with us, or maybe<br />\nthe applause was dying for<br />\nbecause we weren't a usual<br />\nBromberg and it grew again. The<br /><br />\ngroup to play for.<br />\nHe and his son play<br />\ntraditional music with an<br />\nexpertise that makes the<br />\nlightening quick runs up and<br />\ndown the neck of the guitar<br />\nseem effortless and the intricate<br />\npickings seem a snap. They are<br />\ncountry boys, as Doc likes to<br />\nsay, who might seem out of<br />\nplace with us who had just been<br />\nwon over by the contorted, slick<br />\nsounds of the city's Bromberg.<br />\nGravel<br />\nThe timeless gravel of Doc's<br />\nvoice allowed us to imagine the<br />\nshort, broad shouldered man<br />\nsinging the railroad work songs<br />\nin a break from the work on the<br />\nsetting of heavy railroad ties. He<br />\ncould easily fit the musical<br />\ndescription of the Lost Johns or<br />\nJohn Henrys of the past.<br />\nWe were loose, up and waiting<br />\nfor Doc's virtuousity and Merle's<br />\nnote bending. We would forget<br />\nthe showy Bromberg.'<br />\nAs the father and son played<br />\nwe applauded loudly; we<br />\nsuggested songs that we knew<br />\nonly Doc could play; we showed<br />\nthat we knew what he was. Doc<br />\nloosened too. He told a joke on<br />\nMerle that only a father would<br />\ntell about his son. He seemed to<br />\nenjoy it even more than anyone<br />\nelse, especially Merle. Merle even<br />\nspoke to us. In the final song of<br />\nthe night Merle played his banjo,<br />\npicking out the notes so quickly<br />\nthat his hands didn't seem to<br />\nmove and doc sang.
