It is, as a rule, this song which leaves the most lasting<br />\nimpression on a graduate. When a number of old college chums get<br />\ntogether in after life it is not the \"rah, rah\" for them, but the spirited<br />\n\"Alma Mater\" which recalls the pleasant memories of the past.<br />\nIt should not be considered a duty to learn \"Veritas Vos Liberabit.\" It should be the desire of every man, from Freshman to<br />\nSenior, to learn this song as a matter of pride in his university. This<br />\nsong is printed on page three of the Handbook and thus should be<br />\neasily accessible to every one. It might also be well to practice it<br />\nat one of the assemblies.<br />\n<br />\nOUR BOTANICAL GARDENS<br />\nIt may be well to call to the attention of the new students and,<br />\nperhaps, even the older students, the opportunities, apparently wholly<br />\nneglected, that lie in the availability of the Johns Hopkins Botanical<br />\nGardens for pleasant and profitable personal research.<br />\nEven at this late season there, are curious plants, beautiful or<br />\nfantastical flowers, quaint specimens of shrubbery and strange water<br />\nplants in bloom, study of which will amply repay the student with<br />\nan idle half hour at his disposal. There are, for instance, cactus<br />\nplants, crimson dahlias, a weird lavender blossom from North China,<br />\nand plants with long, fuzzy white flower-spikes, with an unpronounceable name.<br />\nMany men seem to believe the gardens open only to students<br />\nof botany and allied sciences. Such, however, is not the case. The<br />\nwalks are free to all. A fellow's sweetheart, one of these pleasant<br />\nautumn afternoons, might not be averse to a stroll through the gardens.<br />\nOf course, it should not be necessary to call attention to the rule<br />\nthat visitors shall not handle or injure in any way any of the growing<br />\nthings.<br />\n<br />\nere's why<br />\n<br />\nCAMELS are<br />\n<br />\nthe quality ci arette<br />\nECAUSE we put the utmost quality into<br />\nthis one brand.

You'll find<br />\nno extra wrappers. No frills or furbelows.<br />\n<br />\nHELLO!<br />\n\"The most cheerful, the most friendly word in the English language is 'hello'. It has brightened life for countless numbers. When<br />\nspoken at the right time it has been the turning point towards happiness and prosperity. It has promoted many lifelong friendships<br />\nand brought its own rewards. It is the magic symbol that turns<br />\ngroups of men into one great brotherhood.<br />\nRealizing the great power of this word, the Student Council, last<br />\nyear, inaugurated a 'Hello' movement in which every Stevens man<br />\nwas asked to yell a hearty 'Hello!' to all the fellow Stevens men he<br />\nmet. It was hoped that such a movement would bring about a closer<br />\nunion of the Student Body, develop friendships, and promote a more<br />\nloyal, more active, and persistent college spirit. Needless to say, the<br />\nmovement was very successful. Last winter and spring, the results<br />\nwere evident in the way Stevens men greeted each other and in the<br />\nmore hospitable spirit that prevailed throughout the campus.\"<br />\nThus comments the \"Stute\" in an editorial.<br />\nA proposition was before the Hopkins Student Council last fall<br />\nto pass a Freshman regulation to the effect that \"Freshmen should<br />\nspeak to all Hopkins men on University grounds.\" This failed to<br />\ngo through as the Council thought that there was an opportunity for<br />\nunreasonable Sophomores to treat the Freshmen unjustly.<br />\nThere cannot be this objection, however, in making the movement voluntarily. The \"Stute\" commends it highly. Why shouldn't<br />\nit work at Hopkins? Start it going today and give every Hopkins<br />\nman you see a hearty \"Hello !\"<br />\n<br />\nSuch things do not improve the smoke any<br />\nmore than premiums or coupons.

It is, as a rule, this song which leaves the most lasting<br />\nimpression on a graduate. When a number of old college chums get<br />\ntogether in after life it is not the \"rah, rah\" for them, but the spirited<br />\n\"Alma Mater\" which recalls the pleasant memories of the past.<br />\nIt should not be considered a duty to learn \"Veritas Vos Liberabit.\" It should be the desire of every man, from Freshman to<br />\nSenior, to learn this song as a matter of pride in his university. This<br />\nsong is printed on page three of the Handbook and thus should be<br />\neasily accessible to every one. It might also be well to practice it<br />\nat one of the assemblies.<br /><br />\nOUR BOTANICAL GARDENS<br />\nIt may be well to call to the attention of the new students and,<br />\nperhaps, even the older students, the opportunities, apparently wholly<br />\nneglected, that lie in the availability of the Johns Hopkins Botanical<br />\nGardens for pleasant and profitable personal research.<br />\nEven at this late season there, are curious plants, beautiful or<br />\nfantastical flowers, quaint specimens of shrubbery and strange water<br />\nplants in bloom, study of which will amply repay the student with<br />\nan idle half hour at his disposal. There are, for instance, cactus<br />\nplants, crimson dahlias, a weird lavender blossom from North China,<br />\nand plants with long, fuzzy white flower-spikes, with an unpronounceable name.<br />\nMany men seem to believe the gardens open only to students<br />\nof botany and allied sciences. Such, however, is not the case. The<br />\nwalks are free to all. A fellow's sweetheart, one of these pleasant<br />\nautumn afternoons, might not be averse to a stroll through the gardens.<br />\nOf course, it should not be necessary to call attention to the rule<br />\nthat visitors shall not handle or injure in any way any of the growing<br />\nthings.<br /><br />\nere's why<br /><br />\nCAMELS are<br /><br />\nthe quality ci arette<br />\nECAUSE we put the utmost quality into<br />\nthis one brand. Camels are as good as it's<br />\npossible for skill, money and lifelong knowledge<br />\nof fine tobaccos to make a cigarette.<br />\nNothing is too good for Camels. And bear<br />\nthis in mind! Everything is done to make<br />\nCamels the best cigarette it's possible to buy.<br />\nNothing is done simply for show.<br />\nTake the Camel package for instance. It's the<br />\nmost perfect packing science can devise to protect cigarettes and keep them fresh. Heavy<br />\npaper\u2014secure foil wrapping\u2014revenue stamp<br />\nto seal the fold and make the package air-tight.<br />\nBut there's nothing flashy about it. You'll find<br />\nno extra wrappers. No frills or furbelows.<br /><br />\nHELLO!<br />\n\"The most cheerful, the most friendly word in the English language is 'hello'. It has brightened life for countless numbers. When<br />\nspoken at the right time it has been the turning point towards happiness and prosperity. It has promoted many lifelong friendships<br />\nand brought its own rewards. It is the magic symbol that turns<br />\ngroups of men into one great brotherhood.<br />\nRealizing the great power of this word, the Student Council, last<br />\nyear, inaugurated a 'Hello' movement in which every Stevens man<br />\nwas asked to yell a hearty 'Hello!' to all the fellow Stevens men he<br />\nmet. It was hoped that such a movement would bring about a closer<br />\nunion of the Student Body, develop friendships, and promote a more<br />\nloyal, more active, and persistent college spirit. Needless to say, the<br />\nmovement was very successful. Last winter and spring, the results<br />\nwere evident in the way Stevens men greeted each other and in the<br />\nmore hospitable spirit that prevailed throughout the campus.\"<br />\nThus comments the \"Stute\" in an editorial.<br />\nA proposition was before the Hopkins Student Council last fall<br />\nto pass a Freshman regulation to the effect that \"Freshmen should<br />\nspeak to all Hopkins men on University grounds.\" This failed to<br />\ngo through as the Council thought that there was an opportunity for<br />\nunreasonable Sophomores to treat the Freshmen unjustly.<br />\nThere cannot be this objection, however, in making the movement voluntarily. The \"Stute\" commends it highly. Why shouldn't<br />\nit work at Hopkins? Start it going today and give every Hopkins<br />\nman you see a hearty \"Hello !\"<br /><br />\nSuch things do not improve the smoke any<br />\nmore than premiums or coupons. And remember<br />\n\u2014you must pay their extra cost or get lowered<br />\nquality.<br />\nIf you want the smoothest, mellowest, mildest<br />\ncigarette you can imagine\u2014and one entirely free<br />\nfrom cigaretty aftertaste,<br />\nIt's Camels for you.<br /><br />\nR.
