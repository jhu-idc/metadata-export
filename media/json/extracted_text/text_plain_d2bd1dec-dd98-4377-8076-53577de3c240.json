All<br />\nthe contestants are picked men,<br />\nsome of whom are coming all the<br />\nway' from North Carolina. None<br />\nof the events will be one-sided, as<br />\nthe entries in the various events are<br />\nvery well balanced.<br />\nThe preliminaries of all the<br />\nevents, except the one and two<br />\nmile runs, will be held on Friday<br />\nafternoon. The best five men in<br />\neach event will qualify for the<br />\nfinals, which will be run off Saturday afternoon before the Swarthmore lacrosse game.<br />\n*<br />\nThe institutions forming the<br />\nSouth Atlantic Intercollegiate Association are: Johns Hopkins University, Washington and Lee University, Georgetown University,<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina, Richmond College, Agricultural and<br />\nMechanical College of North Carolina, Virginia Polytechnic Institute<br />\nand Wake Forest College.<br />\nWith the exception of Wake Forest College they have all entered<br />\nstrong track and field teams. The<br />\nWake Forest athletes want to<br />\nenter, but will probably be prevented by their examinations, which begin this week.<br />\nHandsome medals have been<br />\nordered by the Hopkins committee<br />\nin charge of arranging the meet.<br />\nThe Hopkins committee has done<br />\neverything in its power to make<br />\nthe meet as big a success as po'\u2022<br />\nsible. Special accommodations are<br />\nbeing arranged by the Homewood<br />\ncommittee for the use of the visitors, as the Hopkins clubhouse will<br />\nnot be big enough to accommodate<br />\nthem and the Swarthmore lacrosse<br />\nteam also.

Coaches England and<br />\n<br />\nHoboken, N. J., April 27.\u2014True<br />\nchampionship form was displayed<br />\nby the Johns Hopkins lacrosse team<br />\nwhen it not only defeated but completely shut out the Stevens Institute twelve this afternoon at Castle<br />\nPoint Field by the score of 8 to o.<br />\nThe work of the Baltimore team<br />\nwas practically perfect in every department of the game. The strong<br />\nHopkins defense proved invulnerable, and the attack, especially during the latter part of the second<br />\nhalf, kept the ball in the vicinity<br />\nof the Stevens goal nearly all the<br />\ntime.<br />\nFor the first ten minutes after the<br />\ngame began, the play was fairly<br />\neven. The Hopkins players had<br />\npossession of the ball more than<br />\ntheir opponents, but were unable<br />\nto get within striking distance of<br />\nthe Stevens net. Easter scored the<br />\n.first tally for the visitors and followed it up with two more before<br />\nthe/half was over. Although the<br />\nfield was in a very soggy condition and there were intermittent<br />\nshowers, full 35 - minute halves<br />\nwere played.<br />\nTroxeil, the outhome of the visitors, started the scoring in the second period of play. Captain Gail<br />\nof Hopkins then shot four goals in<br />\n'close succession in the latter part<br />\nof the half. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nattack was beautiful to watch. The<br />\nBaltimoreans moved against the<br />\nStevens goal in perfect unison.<br />\nThey looked over the situation carefully, and worked the extra man<br />\nplay whenever there was an opportunity.<br />\nThe lineup was as follows:<br />\n<br />\nIn a game marked by the heavy<br />\nhitting of the 'varsity and the costly<br />\nerrors of their opponents, the ball<br />\nteam won their first victory over<br />\na local college by.defeating Western<br />\nMaryland at Homewood on Saturday by a score of 8 to 2. Spectacular work by the outfield and by Pete<br />\nPorter at third was largely responsible for the small tally of the visitors. Porter, in addition to accepting several difficult chances, with<br />\nonly one slip-up, managed to net<br />\nfour hits out of five times at .bat,<br />\nbut Ober's catch of Treisler's long<br />\nfly in .the third inning was undoubt(.\u2018dly the most spectacular play of<br />\nthe game. Starting at the first<br />\ncrack of the bat for a ball which,<br />\nat first glance, looked good for a<br />\nhome run, he literally dove for the<br />\nelusive sphere, fell, turned a complete somersault, but came up<br />\nsmilingly with the ball in his glove.<br />\nThe rOoters, ably led by Spring<br />\nCheer Teacher George Gillet, gave<br />\nhim a rousing cheer. The practice gotten by playing such teams<br />\nas Harvard, Yale, Princeton or<br />\nGeorgetown was evident whenever<br />\nthe team got in a hole. Pieper's<br />\nheadwork and pitching at such times<br />\nwas remarkable.<br />\nWestern Maryland's .rightfielder,<br />\nGraefe, redeemed several costly<br />\nerrors by clouting out a homer over<br />\nthe rightfield fence, which, however, could have been easily caught<br />\nhad the rightfield been longer.<br />\nBetter form was shown Saturday<br />\nthan in any game this season, only<br />\nthree errors being chalked up for<br />\nthe 'varsity, and these only came<br />\nfrom the miserable weather conditions.<br />\nThe score:<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3.)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\nStevens<br />\nRiggins<br />\nRatner<br />\nBranch<br />\nParsons<br />\nEntwisle<br />\nBirkenstock<br />\nHenry<br />\nBlakeslee,<br />\n\u2022 Seagrave<br />\nEverton, Voshell Second Attack__ Collins, Dixon<br />\nGraesser<br />\nFirst Atack<br />\nGall<br />\nMoss<br />\n.Inside Home<br />\nTroxell<br />\nVan Siclen<br />\nOutside Home<br />\nEaster<br />\nStevens,<br />\n0.<br />\n8;<br />\nHopkins,<br />\nFinal score\u2014Johns<br />\nScore at the first half-3 to 0.

Resolutions, prepared<br />\nby Mr. J. S. Dickinson at the request of the Student _Council, and<br />\noffered by him, were voted down,<br />\nafter they were amended. These<br />\nresolutions were as follows:<br />\nResolved, That the Athletic Board,<br />\nby not confining itself in its recent<br />\nannouncement of policies to those matters which, as true matters of policy,<br />\ncome within its province, and by undertaking to effect a fundamental alteration in the distribution of powers<br />\nbetween the various elements of our<br />\nathletic organization\u2014students, alumni<br />\nand faculty\u2014has exceeded the limits<br />\nof its constitutional authority,<br />\nResolved, Moreover, that the alterations in the fundamental distribution<br />\nof powers which it effe2ts, and<br />\nwhich confer on representatives of the<br />\nfaculty not merely the.veto power that<br />\nis their just and undisputed right, but<br />\nin addition a minute and all-pervading<br />\npower of direction and management,<br />\nare unnecessary, are insulting, and<br />\ntend to debase sport and .to commercialize athletics.<br />\n<br />\nThese resolutions were offered to<br />\nstart the discussion.

Mr. Dickinson's resolutions applied to Sections I I to 14<br />\nof the \"policies.\" Concerning these<br />\nDr. Magoffin said that the language<br />\nwas unfortunate, and that they<br />\ndidn't mean what they said. The<br />\npolicies in question are as follows:<br />\n11. The director of the gymnasium,<br />\nby reason of his position, is the only<br />\nabsolute head of athletics. He may<br />\ncall into consultation anyone he desires, but the authority for the final<br />\ndecision rests with him.<br />\n12.

The last game\u2014the<br />\none with Carlisle\u2014carried me beyond the \"wonderipg\" point. I decided to settle the question once for<br />\nall, and to publish the results for<br />\nthe benefit of the ages! [Hurrah!]<br />\nI knew that the track of the center would not be straight by any<br />\nmeans. In fact, I found later that<br />\nit was like the crookedness of three<br />\nor four shafts of lightning and several shooting stars linked together.<br />\nI determined to reckon the distance<br />\nby half lengths of the field. The<br />\nhalf length was the best unit of<br />\nmeasurement, because the center<br />\nstarts from the middle of the field.<br />\nOf course, each separate half length<br />\nhad to be estimated, but on the<br />\nwhole I did it carefully, and the results should be reasonably correct.<br />\nI watched both the Indian and<br />\nHopkins centers., The . outcome of<br />\nthe count astonished me. First Half\u2014Hopkins center ran<br />\n717<br />\n2 (half lengths of field). Indian center ran 80 (half lengths of<br />\nfield).<br />\nSecond Half\u2014Hopkins center ran<br />\n70 (half lengths of field). Indian<br />\ncenters\u2014they had three\u2014(90 half<br />\nlengths of field).<br />\nWhole Game\u2014Hopkins center,<br />\n14.072 (half lengths of field). Indian centers, 170 (half lengths of<br />\nfield).<br />\nA half length of the field is 65<br />\nyards. Therefore, the Hopkins center ran 14072x65=9,13272 yards,<br />\nor 5 miles and 33272 yards (that is,<br />\nabout 575 miles).<br />\nThe Indian centers ran 170x65.7--11,050 yards, or 6 miles and 490<br />\nyards (that is, about 67. miles).<br />\nMe for the trolley car!<br />\nYours sincerely,<br />\nMATHEMATICUS INSPIRATICUS.<br />\nApril 20, 1912.<br />\nI have long promised myself the<br />\npleasure of writing and offering to<br />\nTHF, NEWS-LETTER a sort of scientific study of athletics at Johns<br />\nHopkins from the standpoint of the<br />\n\"dub,\" in which I should point out<br />\njust how little chance the unmuscular undergraduate has of getting<br />\nally fun and exercise out of our<br />\nfine athletic equipments:. and in<br />\nwhich I should perhaps offer a few<br />\nsimple ideas, such as will suggest<br />\nthemselves to anyone, as to what<br />\ngreat things enthusiastic leadership<br />\ncould do toward making our athletics help those vtho need help<br />\nmost. I live in hope of seeing the<br />\ntinie when our athletic policy will<br />\nbe expressed in one golden phrase:<br />\n\"Every Hopkins man using Homewood Field.\"<br />\nGranted that this is my viewpoint, as it is that of many other<br />\nstudents and alumni, you can easily<br />\nsee why we are inclined to rage at<br />\nthis other athletic policy of recent<br />\ndate. At a time when the best opportunity offers itself for an effort<br />\nto get the grandstand athlete down<br />\non the field and track, and to give<br />\nhis lungs better exercise than yelling for his favored mates, at -just<br />\nthis time our athletics are to be<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\nstill more commercialized, dictators<br />\nare appointed, some folks mustn't<br />\nmanage and some must\u2014the Johns<br />\nHopkins Athletic Company (Ltd.)<br />\nis incorporated!<br />\nWe don't need new bosses, better<br />\nbosses, or more bosses; we need<br />\nsomebody with enthusiasm and a<br />\nvision, who can get everybody,<br />\nmuscles or no muscles, impatient to<br />\ngo to Homewood of an afternoon,<br />\nto enjoy an hour or two of sport<br />\nunder the Black and Blue.

J., April 27.\u2014True<br />\nchampionship form was displayed<br />\nby the Johns Hopkins lacrosse team<br />\nwhen it not only defeated but completely shut out the Stevens Institute twelve this afternoon at Castle<br />\nPoint Field by the score of 8 to o.<br />\nThe work of the Baltimore team<br />\nwas practically perfect in every department of the game. The strong<br />\nHopkins defense proved invulnerable, and the attack, especially during the latter part of the second<br />\nhalf, kept the ball in the vicinity<br />\nof the Stevens goal nearly all the<br />\ntime.<br />\nFor the first ten minutes after the<br />\ngame began, the play was fairly<br />\neven. The Hopkins players had<br />\npossession of the ball more than<br />\ntheir opponents, but were unable<br />\nto get within striking distance of<br />\nthe Stevens net. Easter scored the<br />\n.first tally for the visitors and followed it up with two more before<br />\nthe/half was over. Although the<br />\nfield was in a very soggy condition and there were intermittent<br />\nshowers, full 35 - minute halves<br />\nwere played.<br />\nTroxeil, the outhome of the visitors, started the scoring in the second period of play. Captain Gail<br />\nof Hopkins then shot four goals in<br />\n'close succession in the latter part<br />\nof the half. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nattack was beautiful to watch. The<br />\nBaltimoreans moved against the<br />\nStevens goal in perfect unison.<br />\nThey looked over the situation carefully, and worked the extra man<br />\nplay whenever there was an opportunity.<br />\nThe lineup was as follows:<br /><br />\nIn a game marked by the heavy<br />\nhitting of the 'varsity and the costly<br />\nerrors of their opponents, the ball<br />\nteam won their first victory over<br />\na local college by.defeating Western<br />\nMaryland at Homewood on Saturday by a score of 8 to 2. Spectacular work by the outfield and by Pete<br />\nPorter at third was largely responsible for the small tally of the visitors. Porter, in addition to accepting several difficult chances, with<br />\nonly one slip-up, managed to net<br />\nfour hits out of five times at .bat,<br />\nbut Ober's catch of Treisler's long<br />\nfly in .the third inning was undoubt(.\u2018dly the most spectacular play of<br />\nthe game. Starting at the first<br />\ncrack of the bat for a ball which,<br />\nat first glance, looked good for a<br />\nhome run, he literally dove for the<br />\nelusive sphere, fell, turned a complete somersault, but came up<br />\nsmilingly with the ball in his glove.<br />\nThe rOoters, ably led by Spring<br />\nCheer Teacher George Gillet, gave<br />\nhim a rousing cheer. The practice gotten by playing such teams<br />\nas Harvard, Yale, Princeton or<br />\nGeorgetown was evident whenever<br />\nthe team got in a hole. Pieper's<br />\nheadwork and pitching at such times<br />\nwas remarkable.<br />\nWestern Maryland's .rightfielder,<br />\nGraefe, redeemed several costly<br />\nerrors by clouting out a homer over<br />\nthe rightfield fence, which, however, could have been easily caught<br />\nhad the rightfield been longer.<br />\nBetter form was shown Saturday<br />\nthan in any game this season, only<br />\nthree errors being chalked up for<br />\nthe 'varsity, and these only came<br />\nfrom the miserable weather conditions.<br />\nThe score:<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3.)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2.)<br /><br />\nStevens<br />\nRiggins<br />\nRatner<br />\nBranch<br />\nParsons<br />\nEntwisle<br />\nBirkenstock<br />\nHenry<br />\nBlakeslee,<br />\n\u2022 Seagrave<br />\nEverton, Voshell Second Attack__ Collins, Dixon<br />\nGraesser<br />\nFirst Atack<br />\nGall<br />\nMoss<br />\n.Inside Home<br />\nTroxell<br />\nVan Siclen<br />\nOutside Home<br />\nEaster<br />\nStevens,<br />\n0.<br />\n8;<br />\nHopkins,<br />\nFinal score\u2014Johns<br />\nScore at the first half-3 to 0.

Resolutions, prepared<br />\nby Mr. J. S. Dickinson at the request of the Student _Council, and<br />\noffered by him, were voted down,<br />\nafter they were amended. These<br />\nresolutions were as follows:<br />\nResolved, That the Athletic Board,<br />\nby not confining itself in its recent<br />\nannouncement of policies to those matters which, as true matters of policy,<br />\ncome within its province, and by undertaking to effect a fundamental alteration in the distribution of powers<br />\nbetween the various elements of our<br />\nathletic organization\u2014students, alumni<br />\nand faculty\u2014has exceeded the limits<br />\nof its constitutional authority,<br />\nResolved, Moreover, that the alterations in the fundamental distribution<br />\nof powers which it effe2ts, and<br />\nwhich confer on representatives of the<br />\nfaculty not merely the.veto power that<br />\nis their just and undisputed right, but<br />\nin addition a minute and all-pervading<br />\npower of direction and management,<br />\nare unnecessary, are insulting, and<br />\ntend to debase sport and .to commercialize athletics.<br /><br />\nThese resolutions were offered to<br />\nstart the discussion. Dr. R. V. D.<br />\nMagoffin, the faculty representative<br />\non the Athletic Board, was the first<br />\nspeaker, and made a thirty-five minute address. Mr. Dickinson's resolutions applied to Sections I I to 14<br />\nof the \"policies.\" Concerning these<br />\nDr. Magoffin said that the language<br />\nwas unfortunate, and that they<br />\ndidn't mean what they said. The<br />\npolicies in question are as follows:<br />\n11. The director of the gymnasium,<br />\nby reason of his position, is the only<br />\nabsolute head of athletics. He may<br />\ncall into consultation anyone he desires, but the authority for the final<br />\ndecision rests with him.<br />\n12. Any new athletic policy or meetings for the discussion of athletic policy, held either by students or alumni,<br />\nshould be brought before the director<br />\nof tile gymnasium.<br />\n13.

The last game\u2014the<br />\none with Carlisle\u2014carried me beyond the \"wonderipg\" point. I decided to settle the question once for<br />\nall, and to publish the results for<br />\nthe benefit of the ages! [Hurrah!]<br />\nI knew that the track of the center would not be straight by any<br />\nmeans. In fact, I found later that<br />\nit was like the crookedness of three<br />\nor four shafts of lightning and several shooting stars linked together.<br />\nI determined to reckon the distance<br />\nby half lengths of the field. The<br />\nhalf length was the best unit of<br />\nmeasurement, because the center<br />\nstarts from the middle of the field.<br />\nOf course, each separate half length<br />\nhad to be estimated, but on the<br />\nwhole I did it carefully, and the results should be reasonably correct.<br />\nI watched both the Indian and<br />\nHopkins centers., The . outcome of<br />\nthe count astonished me. First Half\u2014Hopkins center ran<br />\n717<br />\n2 (half lengths of field). Indian center ran 80 (half lengths of<br />\nfield).<br />\nSecond Half\u2014Hopkins center ran<br />\n70 (half lengths of field). Indian<br />\ncenters\u2014they had three\u2014(90 half<br />\nlengths of field).<br />\nWhole Game\u2014Hopkins center,<br />\n14.072 (half lengths of field). Indian centers, 170 (half lengths of<br />\nfield).<br />\nA half length of the field is 65<br />\nyards. Therefore, the Hopkins center ran 14072x65=9,13272 yards,<br />\nor 5 miles and 33272 yards (that is,<br />\nabout 575 miles).<br />\nThe Indian centers ran 170x65.7--11,050 yards, or 6 miles and 490<br />\nyards (that is, about 67. miles).<br />\nMe for the trolley car!<br />\nYours sincerely,<br />\nMATHEMATICUS INSPIRATICUS.<br />\nApril 20, 1912.<br />\nI have long promised myself the<br />\npleasure of writing and offering to<br />\nTHF, NEWS-LETTER a sort of scientific study of athletics at Johns<br />\nHopkins from the standpoint of the<br />\n\"dub,\" in which I should point out<br />\njust how little chance the unmuscular undergraduate has of getting<br />\nally fun and exercise out of our<br />\nfine athletic equipments:. and in<br />\nwhich I should perhaps offer a few<br />\nsimple ideas, such as will suggest<br />\nthemselves to anyone, as to what<br />\ngreat things enthusiastic leadership<br />\ncould do toward making our athletics help those vtho need help<br />\nmost. I live in hope of seeing the<br />\ntinie when our athletic policy will<br />\nbe expressed in one golden phrase:<br />\n\"Every Hopkins man using Homewood Field.\"<br />\nGranted that this is my viewpoint, as it is that of many other<br />\nstudents and alumni, you can easily<br />\nsee why we are inclined to rage at<br />\nthis other athletic policy of recent<br />\ndate.
