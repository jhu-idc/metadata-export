JOHNS will bring a team supported by an enviable record<br />\nto the Stadium tomorrow. The Johnnies have gone through<br />\na strenuous season of eleven games and have lost none. Their<br />\nattack has shown ,great power, registering 117 goals, or over ten<br />\nper game while the defense has allowed only twenty shots to slip<br />\ninto the netting, an average of less than two each game. Hopkins'<br />\nrecord cannot compare with this. The Jays have already suffered<br />\ntwo defeats at the hands of Army and Rutgers, teams which the<br />\nJohnnies have defeated.<br />\nYet we feel that the experts who are predicting an overwhelming<br />\nSt. Johns victory will be sorely disappointed. A St. Johns man told<br />\nus that \"We are always afraid of Hopkins, because when a Hopkins<br />\nteam gets the ball it always knows what to do with it. We may<br />\nhave better ,individual players, but they know more lacrosse at Hopkins than anywhere in the country.\" That is the secret of Hopkins'<br />\nsuccess at lacrosse over such a long period. Hopkins teams are<br />\ntaught \"what to do with the ball.\" It has been a long and tedious<br />\ntask to instill team play into the new men on the squad, but by tomorrow a real Hopkins team should be ready to take the field.<br />\nBut the team cannot win by itself. It needs the support of the<br />\nundergraduate body in this, its mOst \u201ecritical of games. We have<br />\nlong bewailed the' fact that the energies of the Hopkins cheering<br />\nsection (if it may be dignified by such an appellation) have been<br />\ndirected mainly against the referee. The campus realizes that the<br />\nteam is fighting with its back against The wall and it is up to the<br />\nrest of the students to be giving them support \"on the side of the<br />\nline.\"<br />\nSo far this year the undergraduates have seemed to be endeavoring to press upon the varsity men just how bad a lacrosse team<br />\nHopkins has this year. They fail tel \u2022realize that Olympic teams and<br />\nNational Champions arc not to be expected every year and that off'<br />\nyears are necessary phenornena. Instead, therefore, of encouraging<br />\nthe team and helping it along in its Uphill struggle they have adopted<br />\na supercilious, critical attitude which is unbecoming to say the least.<br />\nThe Hopkins spirit is fine as long as the team is winning, but let it<br />\nsuffer a few reverses and the attitude of the campus changes.<br />\nThe team will be facing heavy odds in the game tomorrow. Yet<br />\nthe old Hopkins' lacrosse knowledge, the heavy schedule of St. Johns,<br />\nand the psychological handicap under which a national title contender always has to labor, give the Jays a fighting chance for victory. It is up to the sidelines to increase that fighting chance.<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\nMARKS, AGAIN<br />\nS another examination season rolls around we renew the plaint<br />\nfor a more consistent system of working. The trouble with<br />\ne present condition lies in the fact that each individual instructor<br />\nfollows his own interpretation of the system, with the result that<br />\nwe have as many different standards as there are professors. One<br />\nman is not averse to giving a few tens, another believes that a ten<br />\nahould mean perfection and so will only grade as high as nine-five.<br />\nA third believes that the others are much too lax and as a consequence tries to correct the general average by sprinkling only a few<br />\neight-fives and eights into a garden of sixes and sevens.<br />\nNot only are the higher grades affected, but, what is much more<br />\nimportant, the difficulty of passing under some instructors is much<br />\ngreater than under others. This may be due to the inherent difficulty of the subject. If so, the professor should realize the fact and<br />\nattempt to correct the discrepancy. We do not urge a laser system<br />\nshould come<br />\noi marking. We do urge, ,however, that the faculty<br />\na more consistent agreement upon the requirements for the various,<br />\n<br />\nt4k.<br />\n<br />\nA census taken at the Univiersity<br />\nof California has set at rest the<br />\nanxiety of the students' motkiers as<br />\nto the nature of the food which Aleir<br />\n\"darlings\" are receiving at the fraternity houses. \"Spaghetti, carrots<br />\nand more carrots, an occasional<br />\nchicken wing, and possible applesauce with doughnuts is a fairly representative collection of the food<br />\nserved.\" Although we are not anxious about them we at least sympa6<br />\nthize.<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\nlffirm-BuTsl<br />\nghe ankle-gashioned Oxford<br />\n<br />\nTEACHERS WANTED<br />\nplanning<br />\nMen and wcxnen who areschools<br />\nor<br />\nto teach in secondary<br />\nor call.

JOHNS will bring a team supported by an enviable record<br />\nto the Stadium tomorrow. The Johnnies have gone through<br />\na strenuous season of eleven games and have lost none. Their<br />\nattack has shown ,great power, registering 117 goals, or over ten<br />\nper game while the defense has allowed only twenty shots to slip<br />\ninto the netting, an average of less than two each game. Hopkins'<br />\nrecord cannot compare with this. The Jays have already suffered<br />\ntwo defeats at the hands of Army and Rutgers, teams which the<br />\nJohnnies have defeated.<br />\nYet we feel that the experts who are predicting an overwhelming<br />\nSt. Johns victory will be sorely disappointed. A St. Johns man told<br />\nus that \"We are always afraid of Hopkins, because when a Hopkins<br />\nteam gets the ball it always knows what to do with it. We may<br />\nhave better ,individual players, but they know more lacrosse at Hopkins than anywhere in the country.\" That is the secret of Hopkins'<br />\nsuccess at lacrosse over such a long period. Hopkins teams are<br />\ntaught \"what to do with the ball.\" It has been a long and tedious<br />\ntask to instill team play into the new men on the squad, but by tomorrow a real Hopkins team should be ready to take the field.<br />\nBut the team cannot win by itself. It needs the support of the<br />\nundergraduate body in this, its mOst \u201ecritical of games. We have<br />\nlong bewailed the' fact that the energies of the Hopkins cheering<br />\nsection (if it may be dignified by such an appellation) have been<br />\ndirected mainly against the referee. The campus realizes that the<br />\nteam is fighting with its back against The wall and it is up to the<br />\nrest of the students to be giving them support \"on the side of the<br />\nline.\"<br />\nSo far this year the undergraduates have seemed to be endeavoring to press upon the varsity men just how bad a lacrosse team<br />\nHopkins has this year. They fail tel \u2022realize that Olympic teams and<br />\nNational Champions arc not to be expected every year and that off'<br />\nyears are necessary phenornena. Instead, therefore, of encouraging<br />\nthe team and helping it along in its Uphill struggle they have adopted<br />\na supercilious, critical attitude which is unbecoming to say the least.<br />\nThe Hopkins spirit is fine as long as the team is winning, but let it<br />\nsuffer a few reverses and the attitude of the campus changes.<br />\nThe team will be facing heavy odds in the game tomorrow. Yet<br />\nthe old Hopkins' lacrosse knowledge, the heavy schedule of St. Johns,<br />\nand the psychological handicap under which a national title contender always has to labor, give the Jays a fighting chance for victory. It is up to the sidelines to increase that fighting chance.<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\nMARKS, AGAIN<br />\nS another examination season rolls around we renew the plaint<br />\nfor a more consistent system of working. The trouble with<br />\ne present condition lies in the fact that each individual instructor<br />\nfollows his own interpretation of the system, with the result that<br />\nwe have as many different standards as there are professors. One<br />\nman is not averse to giving a few tens, another believes that a ten<br />\nahould mean perfection and so will only grade as high as nine-five.<br />\nA third believes that the others are much too lax and as a consequence tries to correct the general average by sprinkling only a few<br />\neight-fives and eights into a garden of sixes and sevens.<br />\nNot only are the higher grades affected, but, what is much more<br />\nimportant, the difficulty of passing under some instructors is much<br />\ngreater than under others. This may be due to the inherent difficulty of the subject. If so, the professor should realize the fact and<br />\nattempt to correct the discrepancy. We do not urge a laser system<br />\nshould come<br />\noi marking.
