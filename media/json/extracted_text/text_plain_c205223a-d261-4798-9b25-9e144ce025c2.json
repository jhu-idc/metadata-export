The<br />\ncommittee is arranging a program<br />\nof as many diversified and attractive events for the entire student<br />\nbody. Their schedule is based on<br />\nthe desire to maintain a low ticket<br />\nprice and, at the same time, be able<br />\nto afford an elaborate arrangement<br />\nin all details. Though the events<br />\non the program are quite similar<br />\nto former years, A more detailed<br />\nelaboration is being planned; and it<br />\nis felt quite certain that the support<br />\nof the student body will warrant<br />\nsuch an expenditure.<br />\nPrice Remains Same<br />\n<br />\nThe price of tickets for under<br />\ngraduates will be fifteen dollars per<br />\ncouple for all events on the program. Although this is the price<br />\ncharged last year the actual cost is<br />\nreduced for each student, as the refreshments will be included in this<br />\nprice. The committee feels that it<br />\nis appropriate to include all refreshments in the tickets. This concession will, of course, involve an<br />\nextra expenditure for the committee, but it is' felt that the general<br />\nwill be appealing<br />\nsatisfaction<br />\nenough to increase the sale of tickets and thus compensate Lor the ad<br />\nditional expenditure.<br />\nCaution Money Used<br />\n<br />\nEvery undergraduate who can<br />\nspare the time at the university will<br />\nbe able to afford the means of attending June Week. The caution<br />\nmoney card will be redeemed as<br />\npart credit toward the purchase of<br />\na ticket. The redemption procedure, however, will differ from last<br />\nyear. Each student, upon securing<br />\nthe'required signatures will endorse<br />\nthe card and present it to the treas<br />\nurer of the June Week Committee<br />\nThe bearer will thus receive credit<br />\nfor the value of his card, paying<br />\nonly the balance due for the price<br />\nof the ticket. These cards will be<br />\naccepted at the Barn prior to the<br />\nweek of exams on *days to be announced later. This plan differs<br />\nfrom last year in that the committee will be able to secure the cards<br />\nwithin a few days and in turn receive the receipts from the treas-<br />\n<br />\nministered with different budgets<br />\nand distinct faculty .staffs.

Swarthmore was simply outclassed and<br />\nbefore five minutes of the game<br />\nhad passed it was merely a question of how many goals Hopkins<br />\nwould score before the end.

After his capital performance in \"Patience,\" as one of the poets, we had expected him to<br />\nbe almost perfect. Probably our disappointment can be based<br />\non the fact that we saw Ernest I,awford take this part in Winthrop Ames' presentation in a flawless manner.<br />\nThe settings in the second act were fine, but those in the opening act were very amateurish. And the costume of Private Willis<br />\nwas worse than a R. 0. T. C. uniform. Also something ought to<br />\nbe done about Mr. Kirkley's wig, which, besides being extremely<br />\ndirty, does not fit him at all well and on sundry occasions the<br />\naudience is allowed to see the frightful looking lining.<br />\nIn presenting \"Iolanthe,\" The Play Arts Guild has attempted<br />\na great undertaking, but for an amateur group, however, they have<br />\ndone nobly, although we consider it inferior to the same organization's presentation of \"Patience.\"<br />\n<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br />\n<br />\nJUST HOW FAR SHOULD THE<br />\nHONOR SYSTEM GO?<br />\nThe honor system at Johns Hopkins has been acclaimed<br />\nas a practical success. No serious violations have been manifest, and offenders have been punished quietly but effectively.<br />\nIt is undoubtedly a tradition which does more toward promoting Hopkins consciousness in students than any other force<br />\non the campus.<br />\nA problem which has thrust its head forward lately,<br />\nhowever, is where the ramifications of the system should end.<br />\nDoes the mere fulfilling of the obligation to hand in work<br />\nunder one's own name which actually is one's own and the<br />\nstrict adherence to honesty in quizzes and examinations absolve one of his duties under the system? The University<br />\nHandbook has said in part for the last three or four years:<br />\n\"The scope of the system is broad. It charges every student<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University to exhibit in his college life<br />\nall the qualities of a gentleman.\" And this interpretation has<br />\nostensibly been approved by the Student Council..<br />\nNow if this be the accepted interpretation of the Honor<br />\nSystem, certain other, less important points of honor become<br />\ninvolved. For example, it is the duty of a student to consider<br />\nthe rights of his fellow in regard to volumes placed upon the<br />\nreserve shelf in the library. He should not take out a book<br />\nfor which there is a large demand without signing for it, nor<br />\nshould he take such a book from the library for hours at a<br />\ntime without using it. This obligation has been so flagrantly<br />\nabused this year that some professors have been forced to<br />\narrange schedules for their classes as to when the students<br />\nmay use reserve books.<br />\nIt has been claimed that attempts to enlarge the scope<br />\nsystem to such picayunish matters as reserve shelf<br />\ntheof<br />\nbooks would in themselves be harmful to the system because<br />\nthe flaws of human nature would soon cause it to break down.<br />\nIt has also been claimed that reference to existing weaknesses<br />\nin the system are harmful because of psychological reasons.<br />\nWe cannot support this view. We believe that an occasional<br />\nboost is a healthy thing for the very reason that human nature<br />\nis what it is.<br />\nWhy has the Honor System failed at other colleges?<br />\nHopkins men are not a sanctified lot who are incapable of<br />\ntransgression. They are just as susceptible to the pleadings<br />\nof their baser selves as are other men. But they have the<br />\nspirit of the Honor System constantly instilled and renewed<br />\nin them.<br />\nIf minor violations are winked at or even disregarded, it<br />\nis easily conceivable that major ones will be attempted. Keep<br />\nthe scope of the Honor System broad, and make it reach every<br />\naction that concerns you and any of your contacts with the<br />\nUniversity. We do not believe in trying to stick to the Honor<br />\nSystem in examinations and letting it drop in other matters.<br />\n<br />\nApparently another student is a follower of George Jean<br />\nNathan, for we have a contribution of a list of statements from a<br />\ncontributor who signs his list, G. E. B., Jr. We were forced to<br />\nuse the \"blue pencil\" on several of his assertions, fearing that<br />\nthey might not meet with the approval of our editor.<br />\nThat Norman Chase Keyes has twenty tickets printed in the<br />\nseasot.i ticket book, when only fifteen are actually needed, in order<br />\nto give students the impression that they are getting a lot for their<br />\nmoney.<br />\nThat each year the freshman class grows worse and worse.<br />\nThat if a class should walk out of the room at thirty-five<br />\nminutes after the hour and the prof. should arrive thirty-six minutes after, the professor is sure to wreak his revenge by giving a<br />\nquiz the next day.<br />\nThat it is impossible to handshake certain professors.<br />\nThat the Baltimore police are just as much a bunch of \"meanon the subject of bonfires as the Annapolis \"coppers\" are<br />\nregarding banquets.<br />\nThat all of the hundred and one foreign magazines from<br />\nSpitzagonia, Heligoland and Zanzibar in the library are a waste<br />\nof money and should be promptly thrown out of the periodical<br />\nalcove so t- hat subscriptions might be forwarded to such journals<br />\nas Life, Judge, Hot Dog and Captain Billy's Whiz-Bang.<br />\nThat the Cotillon Club keys are \"all wet,\" just as they should<br />\nbe.<br />\nD.

The<br />\ncommittee is arranging a program<br />\nof as many diversified and attractive events for the entire student<br />\nbody. Their schedule is based on<br />\nthe desire to maintain a low ticket<br />\nprice and, at the same time, be able<br />\nto afford an elaborate arrangement<br />\nin all details. Though the events<br />\non the program are quite similar<br />\nto former years, A more detailed<br />\nelaboration is being planned; and it<br />\nis felt quite certain that the support<br />\nof the student body will warrant<br />\nsuch an expenditure.<br />\nPrice Remains Same<br /><br />\nThe price of tickets for under<br />\ngraduates will be fifteen dollars per<br />\ncouple for all events on the program. Although this is the price<br />\ncharged last year the actual cost is<br />\nreduced for each student, as the refreshments will be included in this<br />\nprice. The committee feels that it<br />\nis appropriate to include all refreshments in the tickets. This concession will, of course, involve an<br />\nextra expenditure for the committee, but it is' felt that the general<br />\nwill be appealing<br />\nsatisfaction<br />\nenough to increase the sale of tickets and thus compensate Lor the ad<br />\nditional expenditure.<br />\nCaution Money Used<br /><br />\nEvery undergraduate who can<br />\nspare the time at the university will<br />\nbe able to afford the means of attending June Week. The caution<br />\nmoney card will be redeemed as<br />\npart credit toward the purchase of<br />\na ticket. The redemption procedure, however, will differ from last<br />\nyear. Each student, upon securing<br />\nthe'required signatures will endorse<br />\nthe card and present it to the treas<br />\nurer of the June Week Committee<br />\nThe bearer will thus receive credit<br />\nfor the value of his card, paying<br />\nonly the balance due for the price<br />\nof the ticket. These cards will be<br />\naccepted at the Barn prior to the<br />\nweek of exams on *days to be announced later. This plan differs<br />\nfrom last year in that the committee will be able to secure the cards<br />\nwithin a few days and in turn receive the receipts from the treas-<br /><br />\nministered with different budgets<br />\nand distinct faculty .staffs.

MORTON '30<br /><br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br /><br />\nPourboire<br />\n\"Iolanthe,\" the second Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera to<br />\nbe produced by the Play Arts Guild this season, is a show that<br />\nany lover of the combined works of these two Englishmen should<br />\nnot miss.<br />\nWe do not believe that this performance is as well done as yet<br />\nas \"Patience\" but one must remember that \"Iolanthe\" was put<br />\non in a much more hurried fashion than the first Gilbert and<br />\nSullivan presentation at the Guild Theatre.<br />\nAnd then having seen Winthrop Ames' production of<br />\n\"Tolanthe\" we could not help but compare these two performances;<br />\nan altogether unfair comparison, as the Play Arts Guild is an<br />\namateur organization.<br />\nThis comic opera is a most delightful one, the tunes of \"GoodMorrow, Good Mother,\" \"Nine Shall Part Us,\" \"When All<br />\nNight Long,\" \"Oh, Foolish Fay,\" and \"Up in the Air, Sky High,\"<br />\nbeing familiar, more or less, to nearly everybody.<br />\nBurt B. Royce, Jr., as the Earl of Mountarat, was excellent.<br />\nIn fact, to our way of thinking, he did his part (no play on words<br />\nintended, Dr. French) better than any other actor.<br />\nPortraying the role of Phyllis, Miss Mary Bokee sang and<br />\nacted quite well, but Mr. Donald Kirkley, as The Lord Chancellor,<br />\nwas somewhat of a disappointment. After his capital performance in \"Patience,\" as one of the poets, we had expected him to<br />\nbe almost perfect. Probably our disappointment can be based<br />\non the fact that we saw Ernest I,awford take this part in Winthrop Ames' presentation in a flawless manner.<br />\nThe settings in the second act were fine, but those in the opening act were very amateurish. And the costume of Private Willis<br />\nwas worse than a R. 0. T. C. uniform. Also something ought to<br />\nbe done about Mr. Kirkley's wig, which, besides being extremely<br />\ndirty, does not fit him at all well and on sundry occasions the<br />\naudience is allowed to see the frightful looking lining.<br />\nIn presenting \"Iolanthe,\" The Play Arts Guild has attempted<br />\na great undertaking, but for an amateur group, however, they have<br />\ndone nobly, although we consider it inferior to the same organization's presentation of \"Patience.\"<br /><br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br /><br />\nJUST HOW FAR SHOULD THE<br />\nHONOR SYSTEM GO?<br />\nThe honor system at Johns Hopkins has been acclaimed<br />\nas a practical success. No serious violations have been manifest, and offenders have been punished quietly but effectively.<br />\nIt is undoubtedly a tradition which does more toward promoting Hopkins consciousness in students than any other force<br />\non the campus.<br />\nA problem which has thrust its head forward lately,<br />\nhowever, is where the ramifications of the system should end.<br />\nDoes the mere fulfilling of the obligation to hand in work<br />\nunder one's own name which actually is one's own and the<br />\nstrict adherence to honesty in quizzes and examinations absolve one of his duties under the system? The University<br />\nHandbook has said in part for the last three or four years:<br />\n\"The scope of the system is broad. It charges every student<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University to exhibit in his college life<br />\nall the qualities of a gentleman.\" And this interpretation has<br />\nostensibly been approved by the Student Council..<br />\nNow if this be the accepted interpretation of the Honor<br />\nSystem, certain other, less important points of honor become<br />\ninvolved. For example, it is the duty of a student to consider<br />\nthe rights of his fellow in regard to volumes placed upon the<br />\nreserve shelf in the library. He should not take out a book<br />\nfor which there is a large demand without signing for it, nor<br />\nshould he take such a book from the library for hours at a<br />\ntime without using it. This obligation has been so flagrantly<br />\nabused this year that some professors have been forced to<br />\narrange schedules for their classes as to when the students<br />\nmay use reserve books.<br />\nIt has been claimed that attempts to enlarge the scope<br />\nsystem to such picayunish matters as reserve shelf<br />\ntheof<br />\nbooks would in themselves be harmful to the system because<br />\nthe flaws of human nature would soon cause it to break down.<br />\nIt has also been claimed that reference to existing weaknesses<br />\nin the system are harmful because of psychological reasons.<br />\nWe cannot support this view. We believe that an occasional<br />\nboost is a healthy thing for the very reason that human nature<br />\nis what it is.<br />\nWhy has the Honor System failed at other colleges?<br />\nHopkins men are not a sanctified lot who are incapable of<br />\ntransgression. They are just as susceptible to the pleadings<br />\nof their baser selves as are other men. But they have the<br />\nspirit of the Honor System constantly instilled and renewed<br />\nin them.<br />\nIf minor violations are winked at or even disregarded, it<br />\nis easily conceivable that major ones will be attempted. Keep<br />\nthe scope of the Honor System broad, and make it reach every<br />\naction that concerns you and any of your contacts with the<br />\nUniversity. We do not believe in trying to stick to the Honor<br />\nSystem in examinations and letting it drop in other matters.<br /><br />\nApparently another student is a follower of George Jean<br />\nNathan, for we have a contribution of a list of statements from a<br />\ncontributor who signs his list, G. E. B., Jr. We were forced to<br />\nuse the \"blue pencil\" on several of his assertions, fearing that<br />\nthey might not meet with the approval of our editor.<br />\nThat Norman Chase Keyes has twenty tickets printed in the<br />\nseasot.i ticket book, when only fifteen are actually needed, in order<br />\nto give students the impression that they are getting a lot for their<br />\nmoney.<br />\nThat each year the freshman class grows worse and worse.<br />\nThat if a class should walk out of the room at thirty-five<br />\nminutes after the hour and the prof. should arrive thirty-six minutes after, the professor is sure to wreak his revenge by giving a<br />\nquiz the next day.<br />\nThat it is impossible to handshake certain professors.<br />\nThat the Baltimore police are just as much a bunch of \"meanon the subject of bonfires as the Annapolis \"coppers\" are<br />\nregarding banquets.<br />\nThat all of the hundred and one foreign magazines from<br />\nSpitzagonia, Heligoland and Zanzibar in the library are a waste<br />\nof money and should be promptly thrown out of the periodical<br />\nalcove so t- hat subscriptions might be forwarded to such journals<br />\nas Life, Judge, Hot Dog and Captain Billy's Whiz-Bang.<br />\nThat the Cotillon Club keys are \"all wet,\" just as they should<br />\nbe.<br />\nD.

Considering<br />\nthe weather the team has had to<br />\nput up with, Hebner is satisfied<br />\nWith the players' condition. Many<br />\nof the men have played indoors<br />\nthroughout the winter. In practice matches Hebner, Polan and<br />\nLevenstein have shown up best,<br />\nalthough more practice and playing is needed to put them in their<br />\nbest form.

The next idea advanced was<br />\nto have a dance at one of the downtown hotels. This however proved<br />\nimpossible because of advanced<br />\nbookings. After some discussion, it<br />\nryas decided that the only practical<br />\nthing to have would be a dance.<br />\nThe announcement was then made<br />\nthat a dance would be held on Saturday evening, May 7, in the C.
