Harry Lambright<br />\nBusiness Manager<br />\nArt Cleveland<br />\n<br />\nGerard Spanier<br />\n<br />\nReport Considered<br />\nThe report of the committee investigating the SAC<br />\nhas been released and has turned out to be nothing more<br />\nthan a reaffirmation of the present set-up. Not changed<br />\nis the 2.3 rule and waiver; not changed is the self-perpetuating aspect of the SAC found so questionable by the<br />\nStudent-Faculty Camp.<br />\nSince the report has not been accepted we feel there<br />\nis still time for a few comments and suggestions.<br />\nThere is no point in rehashing the problems of the<br />\n,<br />\nand the waiver rule, powers for the enforceaverage<br />\n2.3<br />\nment of which are granted to the SAC. We believe the 2.3<br />\nis too high and the waiver rules leaves too much power in<br />\nthe hands of too small a group. We would .support a 2.0<br />\naverage requirement with no wavers.<br />\nOn the self-perpetuating aspect, we must remind the<br />\nCouncil that the SAC is a committee under the SC's jurisdiction. Yet it has been allowed to become practically<br />\nautonomous through its power over the finances and elections of other Hopkins organizations, detracting greatly<br />\nfrom the influence and prestige of the Student Council.<br />\nThe SAC consists of five men, including a chairman<br />\nchosen by the graduating seniors of the Commission. The<br />\nother four are chosen by the seniors and the prospective<br />\nchairman. The Student Council may review the men<br />\nchosen but has a difficult job since it does not review the<br />\nother men considered.<br />\nThus, in effect, the SAC perpetuates itself, leaving<br />\nthe Council with little to say as to its members.<br />\n'We feel there is an alternative to the present procedure\u2014one which would put the SAC definitely subordinate to the Student Council, yet give it that freedom from<br />\nschool politics it needs to function. We suggest that the<br />\nStudent Council President appoint from among the newly<br />\nelected council members the new SAC Chairman. He, with<br />\nthe retiring seniors on the SAC, would then, interview<br />\nprospective members.<br />\nThis solution would both preeminate the Student<br />\nCouncil and preserve the effectiveness of the Student<br />\nActivities Commission.<br />\n<br />\nH-H Coordination<br />\nWhile the 'BIA-DSRC athletic problem may seem<br />\ntrivial to many, it does shine some light on the eternal<br />\ncontroversy of who should control what at the Homewood.<br />\nThere is so much duplication and parallelism amongst the<br />\n'planning and acting' organizations, and it is so well<br />\nknown among campus leaders, that the action taken by<br />\nthe BIA, which is the Board of Intramural Athletics, could<br />\nvery well be a guidepost for greater inter-organization<br />\nrelations. Instead of half a dozen organizations planning<br />\nsocial activities and conflicting with each other, let the<br />\nCotillion Board, as it has been trying to do, act as a sort<br />\nof clearing house for dates and types of functions. Maintain the Student Council as a student government body<br />\nand let it divert problems not pertaining to its functions<br />\nto the DSRC, the Booster Club, the IFC or whichever<br />\norganization is best set up and coordinated to handle it.<br />\nThis may all sound a bit idealistic, but how much<br />\neffort does it take to channel a problem from, say, the SC<br />\nto the DSRC ... a phone call or a note in a mail box?<br />\nWe've got ourselves a functioning Goucher-Hopkins<br />\nCoordination Committee; maybe we could use a functioning Hopkins-Hopkins Coordination Committee.<br />\n<br />\nAwareness<br />\nThe grand coverage that the News-Letter has afforded<br />\nto the presidential cappaign is an unusual exception to<br />\nour policy of not attempting to cover and' print international, national, or even local news unless it has some connection with the Hopkins Institutions and would be of<br />\ngeneral interest to all its readers.<br />\n'Because of a noticeable lack of organized campus<br />\npolitical activity, but with (we hope) a lot of individual<br />\ninterest in the campaigns and their outcome, we thought<br />\nthat the NeWs-Letter might do well to inform its interested readers about the behind-the- scenes hustle and<br />\nbustle on election night at various important spots around<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nThis election that brought John F. Kennedy to the<br />\n'position of President-elect was the closest presidential<br />\ncampaign since 1880. Perhaps by understanding what<br />\nreally went on on election eve, we might be able to instill<br />\na bit more political awareness in a few more students.<br />\nIsn't this certainly a part of a well-rounded college education?<br />\n<br />\nLiterary Club Stimulates Interest<br />\nThough few people realize it, the Tudor and<br />\nStuart Club is perhaps the only organization on<br />\ncampus which costs members nothing, yet gives<br />\na great deal in return.<br />\nThe club's activities are numerous, including<br />\nmeetings for the exchange of ideas among all<br />\nlevels and schools of the University, the sponsorship of three contests with money prizes, and<br />\nthe maintenance of an extremely fine collection<br />\nof rare books.<br />\nMembers pay no dues and are not required to<br />\nparticipate in anything if they do not wish to..<br />\nThey do, however, benefit from several things.<br />\nFirst are the monthly meetings.

The meetings are<br />\nheld in the club's own beautifully decorated<br />\nrooms on the third floor of Gilman Hall. The<br />\nrooms are open only to members and are a perfect place for study or for research.<br />\nAwards<br />\nAnother important activity is the awarding<br />\nof three prizes to stimulate interest in literature<br />\namong undergraduates. The prizes are: $40 for<br />\nthe best research essay dealing with some aspect<br />\nof English cultural history, $40 for the best<br />\neffort in creative writing, and $20 for the most<br />\nintelligently and carefully planned student library. All undergraduates are eligible and should<br />\nhand in entries by a tentative deadline of March<br />\n1; 1961. For further information, Dr. John Walton, chairman of the Education Department and<br />\npresident of the club, should be consulted.<br />\nFinally, the club maintains a collection of<br />\nrare books, among which is one of the best collections of Spenser in existence. Many of the<br />\nbooks are on shelves in the club room, but the<br />\nmore valuable ones are kept in a large safe.<br />\nClub Origin<br />\nThe club was founded and endowed by Sir<br />\nWilliam and Lady Osler in 1918,,in memory of<br />\ntheir son, Edward Revere Osler, and to stimulate interest in the Tudor and Stuart periods of<br />\nEnglish Literature. The Osler family contributed<br />\nthe money for the endowment and for the book<br />\ncollection, while a friend, Mrs. William Brewster, contributed money to build the club room.<br />\nMembership in the Club is open to any faculty member, graduate, undergraduate, or friend<br />\nof the University recommended by a member.<br />\nDr. Walton feels that the club is \"an excellent chance for students to engage in what<br />\nmight be called very plasant extra-curricular<br />\nactivity, and provides an interest which ought<br />\nto be encouraged among graduates and under-.<br />\ngraduates.\"<br />\n<br />\n-eaViedizandence<br />\nbe that there are other sources<br />\nyou neglected?<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nLastly, we feel it is unfortuFritaken<br />\npoll<br />\nindependent<br />\nAn<br />\nnate<br />\nand typical of Hopkins that<br />\nday and Monday tried to elimiorganization holds a<br />\nstudent<br />\nno<br />\nnate the bias present in your recampus-wide election.

At best the results of both polls indicate only<br />\na close race at Hopkins.<br />\nTo accomplish something we<br />\nwould like to offer a few suggestions.

It<br />\nwould be a shame, a disgrace and a catastrophe to keep these<br />\nbeautiful, intelligent creatures out of college.<br />\nHowever, it is always wise in time of fair weather to prepare<br />\nfor foul.

A slow starting team<br />\nall season, the Jays for once<br />\nreversed the trend and started<br />\nfast.

He is depicted<br />\nas being only a little short of a paid professional and is<br />\nusually thought of as being the beneficiary of both large<br />\nand small favors from professors, administrators, and<br />\nfellow students.<br />\nHe is delineated as a mammoth brute hardly able to<br />\npronounce the name of the university. He is the brunt of<br />\nrumors concerning such illegal practices as \"red-shirting\"<br />\n(playing for more than four years) and bribery.<br />\nIn short, he is not even considered a student, but<br />\nrather a pariah who is well-reimbursed for his services.<br />\nAt Hopkins, a \"small-time\" grid school, a footballplaying student iS not the recipient of special favors<br />\nand there are few, if any, rumors circulated, because no<br />\none talks about him. The question at hand, then, is why<br />\ndo these twenty-eight bruisers spend every week-day<br />\nafternoon knocking heads, and every Saturday defending<br />\nthe well-deserved titles they captured last season.<br />\nLoyalty and a sense of deep pride are the prime<br />\ningredients for a well-knit squad, and the Blue Jay varsity<br />\npigskinners are a well-knit squad. Statistics- produced in<br />\na recent issue of Sports Illustrated proved that college<br />\nathletes were receiving slightly better positions in the<br />\nbusiness world than their merely academic classmates. It<br />\nis the considered opinion here that this loyalty and pride<br />\nare aslo fundamental requisites for success with any firm<br />\nor organization. And these devoted boys have this pride<br />\nand loyalty for the team and for the Johns Hopkins Universal.<br />\nIt looked like Maryland was just too good for them<br />\nbut despite the lopsided score the Varsity Soccermen<br />\nhung in all the way. They fought hard and hustled to the<br />\nlast minute. Maryland had to work hard for those goals<br />\nand there were probably plenty terrapins rubbing their<br />\nblack and blue marks on the way home.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins varsity football<br />\ncontingent, fresh from a convincing conquest of Swarthmore<br />\nlast week, will entertain Mid-Atlantic opponent Dickinson in the<br />\nlast home game of the campaign<br />\ntomorrow afternoon.<br />\nWith the inside track on the<br />\nsouthern part of the Middle-atlantic championship, the Blue<br />\nJay gridders face two must<br />\ngames, this one and the encounter with Western Maryland<br />\none week hence.<br />\nDickinson comes in with an<br />\nunimpressive record for this<br />\nHomecoming weekend, but most<br />\ngrid mentors will tell you it's<br />\nthese \"lowly\" teams that bring<br />\noff the biggest upsets and spoil<br />\nthe dreams of many a title contender.<br />\nThough the Red Devils have<br />\nposted but a 1-5 record for the<br />\nseason, they boast backfield experience and the depth which the<br />\nJays lack. Hopkins will outweigh<br />\ntheir Pennsylvania opponent by<br />\nfive pounds down the line but<br />\nthe likes of Center Don Fields<br />\nand Tackle Jim Wagner should<br />\nprovide a stern test for the Jay<br />\nforward wall.<br />\nRunning out of a varied offense off a split \"T\" formation,<br />\nDickinson should have its major<br />\nproblem in the line where they<br />\nwill be missing the services of<br />\nTackle Dave Morrissey, who was<br />\na real \"headache\" for Hopkins in<br />\nthe clash last year.<br />\nLast Saturday, the Jays bested<br />\na determined Swarthmore aggregation to the tune of 21-12.<br />\nUsing only five plays, primarily<br />\na fullback wedge, the Jays ran<br />\nover and through Garnet lineman, running its seasonal log to<br />\n5-1-1.<br />\nUnbeaten and united in Middle-Atlantic competition, the<br />\nJays are one-half game ahead of<br />\nPennsylvania Military College<br />\nwho are presently sporting a<br />\n5-1-0 mark. In the two conference games remaining, PMC<br />\n<br />\nwill go up against winless<br />\nSwarthmore and power-laden<br />\nLebanon Valley. Though very<br />\ndeep and powerful, the Lebanon<br />\nValley gridders just eeked out<br />\na win over Hopkins' for Dickinson, earlier in the year.<br />\nFollowing PMC in the southern<br />\ndivision are Ursinus (3:3-0),<br />\nWestern<br />\nMaryland<br />\n(1-2-0),<br />\nDickinson (1-4-0), Swarthmore<br />\n(0-3-0), Drexel (0-5-0), and<br />\nHaverford (0-5-0).

After<br />\na very fine job last week in holding a big B.J.C. group to only<br />\ntwo touchdowns, the team has<br />\nan even bigger task cut out for<br />\nthem this week.<br />\nIn containing B.J.C.'s powerful<br />\nsingle-wing attack, Hopkins allowed but two touchdowns via<br />\nthe ground route, the other two<br />\ncoming as opportunity plays on<br />\na kickoff and a poor punt. Two<br />\nOf these TDs were called back<br />\nbecause of penalties against<br />\nB.J.C., however. Bearing special<br />\nnotice on defense were Steve<br />\nErlanger who was outstanding<br />\nas a defensive end, and Joe Hahn<br />\nand Chuck Aronhalt who shared<br />\ntop tackle honors with 5 apiece.<br />\nThe rest of the forward wall<br />\nalso deserves a vote of confidence<br />\nfor their part in containing their<br />\nMuch bigger and heavier opponents.<br />\nDirecting the offense, which<br />\ngained more yardage than in<br />\n<br />\nany previous outing this year,<br />\nwas quarterback Tom Tropp.<br />\nRushing, Hopkins piled up 104<br />\nyards to Baltimore Junior College's 172. A large part of this<br />\nyardage, in fact 56 yards of it,<br />\nbelonged to halfback John Heller<br />\nwho averaged 5.6 yards per carry. Fullback Walt Divers was<br />\nsecond with an average of 3.5'<br />\nIt was a good day all around for<br />\nthe freshman team.<br />\nGettysburg, while not so big as<br />\nB.J.C., is undoubtedly a stronger<br />\nteam, having the experience of<br />\n13 high school captains or cocaptains on their squad. In the<br />\npast two seasons.at Hopkins, the<br />\nfrosh footballers have lost only<br />\nOne game each. Both of these<br />\nhave been to Gettysburg outfits<br />\nlike this year's. This suffices to<br />\nshow it's going to be a tough<br />\ngame, especially for Hopkins.<br />\nThere were several odd punt<br />\nplays in the game, both involving<br />\nkicker Chuck Aronhalt. In the<br />\nfirst of these, a short kick was<br />\ncaught by the wind and blown<br />\nback to the home five-yard line<br />\nwhere a Baltimore Junior College<br />\nlineman scooped it up and carried the pigskin to pay dirt.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from Page 9)<br />\nThe last quarter was a fingernail biter all the way as first<br />\nthe Jays, and then Washington,<br />\nfired away at each others' goalies.<br />\nBob Keane, JHU netminder, successfully repulsed all W.C. scoring efforts and Hopkins won its<br />\nsecond shutout in a row.<br />\n<br />\nfrom College Park methodically<br />\ndeflated Hopkins hope of pulling off one of the upsets of the<br />\nyear.

Harry Lambright<br />\nBusiness Manager<br />\nArt Cleveland<br /><br />\nGerard Spanier<br /><br />\nReport Considered<br />\nThe report of the committee investigating the SAC<br />\nhas been released and has turned out to be nothing more<br />\nthan a reaffirmation of the present set-up. Not changed<br />\nis the 2.3 rule and waiver; not changed is the self-perpetuating aspect of the SAC found so questionable by the<br />\nStudent-Faculty Camp.<br />\nSince the report has not been accepted we feel there<br />\nis still time for a few comments and suggestions.<br />\nThere is no point in rehashing the problems of the<br />\n,<br />\nand the waiver rule, powers for the enforceaverage<br />\n2.3<br />\nment of which are granted to the SAC. We believe the 2.3<br />\nis too high and the waiver rules leaves too much power in<br />\nthe hands of too small a group. We would .support a 2.0<br />\naverage requirement with no wavers.<br />\nOn the self-perpetuating aspect, we must remind the<br />\nCouncil that the SAC is a committee under the SC's jurisdiction. Yet it has been allowed to become practically<br />\nautonomous through its power over the finances and elections of other Hopkins organizations, detracting greatly<br />\nfrom the influence and prestige of the Student Council.<br />\nThe SAC consists of five men, including a chairman<br />\nchosen by the graduating seniors of the Commission. The<br />\nother four are chosen by the seniors and the prospective<br />\nchairman. The Student Council may review the men<br />\nchosen but has a difficult job since it does not review the<br />\nother men considered.<br />\nThus, in effect, the SAC perpetuates itself, leaving<br />\nthe Council with little to say as to its members.<br />\n'We feel there is an alternative to the present procedure\u2014one which would put the SAC definitely subordinate to the Student Council, yet give it that freedom from<br />\nschool politics it needs to function. We suggest that the<br />\nStudent Council President appoint from among the newly<br />\nelected council members the new SAC Chairman. He, with<br />\nthe retiring seniors on the SAC, would then, interview<br />\nprospective members.<br />\nThis solution would both preeminate the Student<br />\nCouncil and preserve the effectiveness of the Student<br />\nActivities Commission.<br /><br />\nH-H Coordination<br />\nWhile the 'BIA-DSRC athletic problem may seem<br />\ntrivial to many, it does shine some light on the eternal<br />\ncontroversy of who should control what at the Homewood.<br />\nThere is so much duplication and parallelism amongst the<br />\n'planning and acting' organizations, and it is so well<br />\nknown among campus leaders, that the action taken by<br />\nthe BIA, which is the Board of Intramural Athletics, could<br />\nvery well be a guidepost for greater inter-organization<br />\nrelations. Instead of half a dozen organizations planning<br />\nsocial activities and conflicting with each other, let the<br />\nCotillion Board, as it has been trying to do, act as a sort<br />\nof clearing house for dates and types of functions.

He is depicted<br />\nas being only a little short of a paid professional and is<br />\nusually thought of as being the beneficiary of both large<br />\nand small favors from professors, administrators, and<br />\nfellow students.<br />\nHe is delineated as a mammoth brute hardly able to<br />\npronounce the name of the university. He is the brunt of<br />\nrumors concerning such illegal practices as \"red-shirting\"<br />\n(playing for more than four years) and bribery.<br />\nIn short, he is not even considered a student, but<br />\nrather a pariah who is well-reimbursed for his services.<br />\nAt Hopkins, a \"small-time\" grid school, a footballplaying student iS not the recipient of special favors<br />\nand there are few, if any, rumors circulated, because no<br />\none talks about him. The question at hand, then, is why<br />\ndo these twenty-eight bruisers spend every week-day<br />\nafternoon knocking heads, and every Saturday defending<br />\nthe well-deserved titles they captured last season.<br />\nLoyalty and a sense of deep pride are the prime<br />\ningredients for a well-knit squad, and the Blue Jay varsity<br />\npigskinners are a well-knit squad. Statistics- produced in<br />\na recent issue of Sports Illustrated proved that college<br />\nathletes were receiving slightly better positions in the<br />\nbusiness world than their merely academic classmates. It<br />\nis the considered opinion here that this loyalty and pride<br />\nare aslo fundamental requisites for success with any firm<br />\nor organization. And these devoted boys have this pride<br />\nand loyalty for the team and for the Johns Hopkins Universal.<br />\nIt looked like Maryland was just too good for them<br />\nbut despite the lopsided score the Varsity Soccermen<br />\nhung in all the way.

Hopkins will outweigh<br />\ntheir Pennsylvania opponent by<br />\nfive pounds down the line but<br />\nthe likes of Center Don Fields<br />\nand Tackle Jim Wagner should<br />\nprovide a stern test for the Jay<br />\nforward wall.<br />\nRunning out of a varied offense off a split \"T\" formation,<br />\nDickinson should have its major<br />\nproblem in the line where they<br />\nwill be missing the services of<br />\nTackle Dave Morrissey, who was<br />\na real \"headache\" for Hopkins in<br />\nthe clash last year.<br />\nLast Saturday, the Jays bested<br />\na determined Swarthmore aggregation to the tune of 21-12.<br />\nUsing only five plays, primarily<br />\na fullback wedge, the Jays ran<br />\nover and through Garnet lineman, running its seasonal log to<br />\n5-1-1.<br />\nUnbeaten and united in Middle-Atlantic competition, the<br />\nJays are one-half game ahead of<br />\nPennsylvania Military College<br />\nwho are presently sporting a<br />\n5-1-0 mark.

After<br />\na very fine job last week in holding a big B.J.C. group to only<br />\ntwo touchdowns, the team has<br />\nan even bigger task cut out for<br />\nthem this week.<br />\nIn containing B.J.C.'s powerful<br />\nsingle-wing attack, Hopkins allowed but two touchdowns via<br />\nthe ground route, the other two<br />\ncoming as opportunity plays on<br />\na kickoff and a poor punt. Two<br />\nOf these TDs were called back<br />\nbecause of penalties against<br />\nB.J.C., however. Bearing special<br />\nnotice on defense were Steve<br />\nErlanger who was outstanding<br />\nas a defensive end, and Joe Hahn<br />\nand Chuck Aronhalt who shared<br />\ntop tackle honors with 5 apiece.<br />\nThe rest of the forward wall<br />\nalso deserves a vote of confidence<br />\nfor their part in containing their<br />\nMuch bigger and heavier opponents.<br />\nDirecting the offense, which<br />\ngained more yardage than in<br /><br />\nany previous outing this year,<br />\nwas quarterback Tom Tropp.<br />\nRushing, Hopkins piled up 104<br />\nyards to Baltimore Junior College's 172. A large part of this<br />\nyardage, in fact 56 yards of it,<br />\nbelonged to halfback John Heller<br />\nwho averaged 5.6 yards per carry. Fullback Walt Divers was<br />\nsecond with an average of 3.5'<br />\nIt was a good day all around for<br />\nthe freshman team.<br />\nGettysburg, while not so big as<br />\nB.J.C., is undoubtedly a stronger<br />\nteam, having the experience of<br />\n13 high school captains or cocaptains on their squad. In the<br />\npast two seasons.at Hopkins, the<br />\nfrosh footballers have lost only<br />\nOne game each. Both of these<br />\nhave been to Gettysburg outfits<br />\nlike this year's. This suffices to<br />\nshow it's going to be a tough<br />\ngame, especially for Hopkins.<br />\nThere were several odd punt<br />\nplays in the game, both involving<br />\nkicker Chuck Aronhalt. In the<br />\nfirst of these, a short kick was<br />\ncaught by the wind and blown<br />\nback to the home five-yard line<br />\nwhere a Baltimore Junior College<br />\nlineman scooped it up and carried the pigskin to pay dirt.<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 9)<br />\nThe last quarter was a fingernail biter all the way as first<br />\nthe Jays, and then Washington,<br />\nfired away at each others' goalies.<br />\nBob Keane, JHU netminder, successfully repulsed all W.C. scoring efforts and Hopkins won its<br />\nsecond shutout in a row.<br /><br />\nfrom College Park methodically<br />\ndeflated Hopkins hope of pulling off one of the upsets of the<br />\nyear. Scoring in every period,<br />\nand with inside right Cliff Krug<br />\nnetting five, the Marylanders<br />\ncontrolled the game throughout,<br /><br />\nand at will.<br />\nWith two games remaining,<br />\nagainst Drexel here on Saturday<br />\nat noon, and Western Maryland<br />\naway Nov. 19, the Bluejays still<br />\nhave an outside chance for the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Southern crown.<br /><br />\nThe victory over Washington<br />\nlifted the Jays Middle Atlantic<br />\nmark to 4-1, with two games remaining. Hopkins is undefeated<br />\nin Mason-Dixon play, with a 3-0<br />\nmark, but are ineligible for the<br />\ntitle as they do not play enough<br />\ngames.<br />\nWednesday saw the Homewoodians play host to the only<br />\nnon-league opponent on their<br />\nschedule, perenially powerful<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nThe Jays were outclassed from<br />\nthe beginning as Maryland's<br />\ncombination of speed, skill,<br />\nhustle\u201e and general superiority<br />\nsent the home team down to<br />\ntheir worst defeat since 1956's<br />\nbeating by the same team, and<br />\nsame score, 7-0.
