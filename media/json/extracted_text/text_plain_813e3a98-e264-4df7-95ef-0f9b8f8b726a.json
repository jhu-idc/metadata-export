We must, consequently, carry on the struggle until we can<br />\nwin the terms of settlement which<br />\nare most likely to prevent a repetition of the crime of 1914, and to<br />\nguarantee a peace that will endure.<br />\nNow, there are at least four preventives against future wars of aggression which we can, if we will,<br />\nsecure; and if we (10 not mean to<br />\nleave our all-important task half<br />\n(lone, we sha 11 insist upon securing<br />\nall of them :<br />\n(a) First, the outcome.of this<br />\nwar must make it clear beyond a<br />\nperadventure that military aggression is, even for the most powerful, the best organized, the longest<br />\nprepared, of modern states an eminently unprofitable enterprise. So<br />\nlong as predatory war seems to<br />\npromise national advantage, so<br />\n1014 may it be expected to be<br />\npracticed by ambitious governments controlling large military<br />\nforces. Friedrich Naumann, one<br />\nof the most influential of German<br />\npolitical writers, has frankly characterized war as eine kapitalistische Aktion, a profit-seeking undertaking, \"waged in the interest<br />\nof the economic development of<br />\nthe state\"; and he has sought to<br />\njustify successful war on these<br />\ngrounds. It can hardly be doubted that the conduct of the Berlin<br />\ngovernment in 1914*was what it<br />\nwas largely because Prussia's skilfully camouflaged aggressions of<br />\n1864, 1866 and 1870\u2014not to speak<br />\nof that of 1741\u2014were so immensely profitable. But it must now<br />\nbe shown that this form of business enterprise, this way of \"intervening in the general economic<br />\nconflict\" (to use another pharse<br />\nof Naumann's) no longer has any<br />\nreasonable prospect of success.<br />\nThe experience of mankind has<br />\npretty well proved that the only<br />\neffective way of abolishing the<br />\nbrigandage (once so flourishing)<br />\nlies in making it too dangerous<br />\nto be tempting.<br />\nBut the unprofitableness of<br />\nGermany's assault upon her neigh-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, JANUARY 14, 1918.<br />\nborsin 1914 will not be conclusively demonstrated by a mere restoration of the nominal status quo<br />\nante helium.

It is.not as generally known to Americans as it<br />\nshould be that the sword. which<br />\nthe German Emperor so long rattled menacingly and which he<br />\nfinally drew from its scabbard in<br />\n1914, was a stolen sword. For<br />\nsome two-thirds of Germany's domestic steel supply comesfrom the<br />\nLorraine iron mines, which were<br />\ntaken from France in 1871. In the<br />\nwords of a well-known German<br />\neconomist, Professor Schumacher:<br />\n\"Without the minette ore of Lorraine we cannot maintain our<br />\niron and stel productionon a scale<br />\nsufficiently large for the conduct<br />\nof the war.

All the more needful,<br />\ntherefore, becomes the employment of the other available means<br />\nfor giving permanence to the<br />\npeace which will bring the present<br />\nbloodshed to an end.<br />\nThose who still wonder why we<br />\nshould be willing to help set Europe's affairs in order, who still<br />\ncry \"What have we to do with<br />\nabroad !\" have learned strangely<br />\nlittle from the past four years,<br />\nand have singularly failed to apprehend the chief significance of<br />\nAmerica's participation in this<br />\nwar. What those years have<br />\ntaught is that no peace-loving nation is safe unless many or all<br />\nsuch nations make it evident that<br />\nthey arewilling and able not merebutalso to<br />\nly to defend themselves,'<br />\ndefend one another, against lawlessness and aggression. It appears to be only by such general<br />\ndefensive co-operation for the repression of international violance<br />\nand breach of faith that any people can, under modern conditions,<br />\ncount upon real security for itself; and it is precisely in such<br />\nco-operation that we are now engaged. We are in the war to help<br />\nto put an end to international<br />\nanarchy, from the effects of which<br />\nwe had ourselves begun to suffer<br />\nintolerably; and while, to accomplish this, we must get rid of our<br />\nnational individualism, we are doing no more than an enlightened<br />\nnational self-interest would dictate. It is only in a society of nations in which peace and order<br />\nand justice prevail, and in which<br />\neach nation is ready to obey, and<br />\nto defend, the law that is common<br />\nto them all, that America can fulfil its own destinies.

Dr. Ames and carried<br />\nout through the efforts of Professors Christie and Keowenhoven, of<br />\nthe department of engineering of<br />\nthe University, has resulted in the<br />\nestablishment of a preparatory<br />\nschool at Johns Hopkins for prospective aviators. The school is to<br />\ncontinpe for six weeks beginning<br />\ntoday.<br />\nThe instruction to be given is<br />\nentirely voluntary on the part of<br />\nthe professors giving the courses,<br />\nand there will be no changes whatever, with the possible exception<br />\nof laboratory fees. The object of<br />\nthe school, according to Professor<br />\nChristie, is to give as much preliminary instruction as possible<br />\nin the subjects studied at the<br />\nground schools at Princeton and<br />\nthe Massachusetts Institute of<br />\nTechnology. \"The courses given<br />\nat these schools,\" Professor Christie said, \"are extremely intensive<br />\nand difficult\u2014between 30 and 40<br />\nper cent. of the entrants fail.

The<br />\nstudent must report the course selected to the Registrar before June<br />\n1. A fine of one dollaradaywillbe<br />\nlevied for delay in making this report. Changes in the course may<br />\nbe made by notification to the<br />\nRegistrar at any time before September 25; after that date only<br />\nwith the approval of the Dean.<br />\nStudents who fail to attend<br />\ncourses selected, or who drop<br />\ncourses without the approval of<br />\nthe Dean, will be marked absent<br />\nand will be subject to the regulations of the Committee on absence.<br />\n2. All undergraduate students,<br />\nnew and old, must register at the<br />\nRegistrar's Office on September<br />\n27, 28, or 30, 1918. A fine of one<br />\ndollar for each day of delay will<br />\nbe levied against those who fail to<br />\nregister before 4 P.

So<br />\nlong as predatory war seems to<br />\npromise national advantage, so<br />\n1014 may it be expected to be<br />\npracticed by ambitious governments controlling large military<br />\nforces. Friedrich Naumann, one<br />\nof the most influential of German<br />\npolitical writers, has frankly characterized war as eine kapitalistische Aktion, a profit-seeking undertaking, \"waged in the interest<br />\nof the economic development of<br />\nthe state\"; and he has sought to<br />\njustify successful war on these<br />\ngrounds. It can hardly be doubted that the conduct of the Berlin<br />\ngovernment in 1914*was what it<br />\nwas largely because Prussia's skilfully camouflaged aggressions of<br />\n1864, 1866 and 1870\u2014not to speak<br />\nof that of 1741\u2014were so immensely profitable. But it must now<br />\nbe shown that this form of business enterprise, this way of \"intervening in the general economic<br />\nconflict\" (to use another pharse<br />\nof Naumann's) no longer has any<br />\nreasonable prospect of success.<br />\nThe experience of mankind has<br />\npretty well proved that the only<br />\neffective way of abolishing the<br />\nbrigandage (once so flourishing)<br />\nlies in making it too dangerous<br />\nto be tempting.<br />\nBut the unprofitableness of<br />\nGermany's assault upon her neigh-<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, JANUARY 14, 1918.<br />\nborsin 1914 will not be conclusively demonstrated by a mere restoration of the nominal status quo<br />\nante helium. For, as we have now<br />\nlearned to recognize, Germany,<br />\neven though she should gain no<br />\nterritory from her enemies, has<br />\nduring the war virtually annexed<br />\nher allies\u2014has added their forces<br />\nto her own military power, and<br />\nhas made them subservient to her<br />\neconomic interests. This very<br />\ngreat profit from the war which<br />\nshe forced upon Europe, Germany<br />\ncan be prevented from retaining<br />\nonly by the defeat of her scheme<br />\n' for a Mitteleuropa ; and to its defeat the tenth, eleventh, twelfth<br />\nand thirteenth of Mr. Wilson's<br />\nconditions of peace are directed\u2014<br />\nthose dealing with the peoples of<br />\nAustria-Hungary, with Rumania,<br />\nSerbia and Montenegro, with the<br />\nnon-Turkish nationalities now wider Turkish rule, and with Poland.<br />\n(b) A second obvious aid towards the establishment of a lasting peace,or,atthe least, of a greater security for peaceful countries,<br />\nlies in diminishing the offensive<br />\npower of any nation which has unmistakably shown itself to be a<br />\nmenace to its neighbors, Such a<br />\nmeasure would, it is true, defeat<br />\nits own ends if it meant, the subjection of any civilized population<br />\nto an alien or oppressive rule. But<br />\nit is one of the few happy circumstances of the present tragic tangle of the world's affairs that the<br />\npowN. now held by that State<br />\nwhich has proved itself a veritable<br />\nin imicus generis hutnani can he<br />\ngreatly diminished with no violaion of the liberty of its people or<br />\nof the principle\u2022of nationality, but<br />\nrather by acts of simple justice<br />\nand reparation.<br />\nMost important, perhaps,among<br />\nsuch acts is the restoration of Lorraine to France. It is.not as generally known to Americans as it<br />\nshould be that the sword. which<br />\nthe German Emperor so long rattled menacingly and which he<br />\nfinally drew from its scabbard in<br />\n1914, was a stolen sword. For<br />\nsome two-thirds of Germany's domestic steel supply comesfrom the<br />\nLorraine iron mines, which were<br />\ntaken from France in 1871. In the<br />\nwords of a well-known German<br />\neconomist, Professor Schumacher:<br />\n\"Without the minette ore of Lorraine we cannot maintain our<br />\niron and stel productionon a scale<br />\nsufficiently large for the conduct<br />\nof the war. Happily we can boast<br />\nof the largest iron deposits in Eu-<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nrope. These we have obtained in<br />\nconsequence of the victorious war<br />\nof 1870-71.\" Thus .the return of<br />\nthis territory to .France would<br />\nvery materially diminish Germany's capacity for aggression,<br />\nwhile it would at the same time<br />\nrepair an historic injustice. Yet,<br />\nif able to import steel freely, Germany, under such leaders as now<br />\nshape her policy, might still be<br />\nformidable enough, if the plan of<br />\na Central European (and Turkish) federation were carried out,<br />\nso that the foreign and military<br />\nA.

All the more needful,<br />\ntherefore, becomes the employment of the other available means<br />\nfor giving permanence to the<br />\npeace which will bring the present<br />\nbloodshed to an end.<br />\nThose who still wonder why we<br />\nshould be willing to help set Europe's affairs in order, who still<br />\ncry \"What have we to do with<br />\nabroad !\" have learned strangely<br />\nlittle from the past four years,<br />\nand have singularly failed to apprehend the chief significance of<br />\nAmerica's participation in this<br />\nwar. What those years have<br />\ntaught is that no peace-loving nation is safe unless many or all<br />\nsuch nations make it evident that<br />\nthey arewilling and able not merebutalso to<br />\nly to defend themselves,'<br />\ndefend one another, against lawlessness and aggression. It appears to be only by such general<br />\ndefensive co-operation for the repression of international violance<br />\nand breach of faith that any people can, under modern conditions,<br />\ncount upon real security for itself; and it is precisely in such<br />\nco-operation that we are now engaged. We are in the war to help<br />\nto put an end to international<br />\nanarchy, from the effects of which<br />\nwe had ourselves begun to suffer<br />\nintolerably; and while, to accomplish this, we must get rid of our<br />\nnational individualism, we are doing no more than an enlightened<br />\nnational self-interest would dictate. It is only in a society of nations in which peace and order<br />\nand justice prevail, and in which<br />\neach nation is ready to obey, and<br />\nto defend, the law that is common<br />\nto them all, that America can fulfil its own destinies. There is, no<br />\ndoubt, a sense in which it may be<br />\nsaid that the cause of Belgium, or<br />\nFrance, or Serbia, or Poland, is<br />\n\"not America's business.\" But the<br />\ncause of lasting peace, of international good faith and of the public<br />\nlaw of the civilized world is everybody's business; and it is in the<br />\ncause of these nations that it has<br />\nat the present juncture come to be<br />\nembodied.<br />\nYet even if it were otherwise\u2014<br />\nif our own interests were less vitally involved in these matters\u2014<br />\nour duty would be no less plain.<br />\nWe are a nation sprung from<br />\nevery stock in Europe, inheritors<br />\nof all that these older peoples<br />\nhave in the past done for the enrichment of human life.

Practice is<br />\nbeing held on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday afternoons in the cage; and the new<br />\nmen are making very Satisfactory<br />\nprogress in their stickwork.<br />\nThe chief problem this year will<br />\nbe the development of a goal-keeper, for there is no one on the squad<br />\nwho has had much experience in<br />\nthat work. \"Jake\" Miller, a freshman from City College, and Plitt<br />\nSadtler, also a new man, have<br />\nshowed up well at this job. The<br />\ndefense material looks pretty<br />\ngood, with \"Dutch\" Schmidt, a<br />\nveteran of two seasons, Herb Baxley, John Stanley, and Golder,<br />\nsubs from last year, and Morley,<br />\nCarey, Baker, and Frisch, the new<br />\nmen. , In the midfield there are<br />\nCaptain Wolfe, \"Tiff\" Williams,<br />\n\"Base\" Kennedy, and Ed Jarrett,<br />\nwhile among the attack candidates<br />\nare \"Shorty\" Stuart, Sam Silverstein, and Marion Defandorf; from<br />\nlast spring, and a large number of<br />\nnew men, including Winslow, star<br />\nquarter-miler, Craft, Earle, Beall,<br />\nLachman,Vickers and McTarlarlre.<br /><br />\nSend Your Name for Monthly List<br /><br />\nCharles Street, at Mulberry<br /><br />\nMEN'S AND YOUNG<br />\nMEN'S CLOTHING<br />\nAND FURNISHINGS<br />\n\u2014correct in style<br />\n--high grade in quality<br />\n\u2014moderate in price<br /><br />\nSTEWART1161.<br />\nIn Canneenon With lames MeCreery &amp; Co.
