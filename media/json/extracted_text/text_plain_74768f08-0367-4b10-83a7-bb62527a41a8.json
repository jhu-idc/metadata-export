It consists of a set of recommendations,<br />\nprepared pursuant to state law, to provide assistance to units of local<br />\ngovernment and the state government in meeting the challenge of inevitable<br />\ngrowth. It focuses on problems and opportunities which are common to<br />\nseveral units of government or which affect more than one unit of govern-<br />\nment.

Only freeways, expressways, and major urban and rural arterial<br />\nroads are shown in the plan. The network has been planned to encourage<br />\ndevelopment where it would be least costly to provide public services, and<br />\nto deter development where it would destroy prize open-space areas or<br />\nwould be undesirable in other ways.<br />\n<br />\nThe principal additions to the existing system acknowledge the major<br />\ngrowth expected toward Columbia and Washington to the southwest, and<br />\ntoward Wilmington and Philadelphia to the northeast. The new roads<br />\ninclude a new and better U. S. Route 1 extending northeast from the city;<br />\nNorthwest and Liberty Expressways into the northwest part of the Region;<br />\nI-70N westerly in the general location of U. S. Route 40; an improved Route<br />\n29 and a continuation of I-95 through Howard County; and the Arundel<br />\nFreeway facilitating transportation in the urban portion of Anne Arundel<br />\nCounty and connecting with the Bay Bridge. Other major features include<br />\nlinks from the Beltway into the waterfront and industrial areas of Marley<br />\nNeck, Sparrows Point, Back River, and White Marsh; a future second<br />\nharbor crossing; and three connector freeways across the southern part of<br />\nthe Region. In the future, major rural highways could connect the fringes<br />\nof the Region from Annapolis to Westminster, and then east across the<br />\nnorthern area to Aberdeen.<br />\n<br />\nThe mass transit system will provide vastly improved transportation<br />\nservice for people travelling within the Region. The 65-mile rail portion<br />\nof the transit system consists of a loop surrounding the core of Baltimore,<br />\nand radial lines reaching from the inner-city loop outward along six major<br />\ndevelopment corridors. Subsequent transit extensions are possible to<br />\nAberdeen, Annapolis, Columbia, and Washington when patronage warrants.<br />\n<br />\nThe rail rapid-transit system would be supported by a complex of<br />\nmodern commuter express buses on exclusive rights of way and on the<br />\nfreeways, and improved feeder bus lines from suburban residential areas<br />\nto the rail transit stations.<br />\n<br />\nANNES good transportation facilities, and convenient shopping areas.

Many areas might contain not just one form of housing but<br />\na reasonable and practicable variety of housing types.<br />\n<br />\nNot every area shown will actually be developed. The plan leaves ade-<br />\nquate room for choice.<br />\n<br />\nOpen Space<br />\n<br />\nThe open space element of the plan provides many benefits for the<br />\nRegion\u2019s inhabitants. First, it recognizes the rural values of the Region.<br />\nIn addition, it preserves features of the natural environment to make the<br />\narea more beautiful, protect natural resources, safeguard the water supply,<br />\nand provide land for recreation and leisure. One of its major purposes is<br />\nto serve as the background for more livable communities which will be<br />\ndeveloped within the open space pattern.<br />\n<br />\nThere is still much open land because pressures for development have<br />\nnot reached all of it. However, there is limited open space which is now<br />\npermanently reserved for the future. The plan provides a guide for the<br />\npublic action which is needed to safeguard this natural heritage.<br />\n<br />\nThe plan defines three categories of open space. One is the primary<br />\nsystem which requires either acquisition or some form of public protection<br />\nof land which is subject to early development pressures, or which protects<br />\npublic water supply watersheds, or contains unique natural features. The<br />\nprimary system provides an interconnected series of reserves and recreation<br />\nareas which link together major existing recreation areas and open spaces,<br />\nareas of exceptional natural beauty, scenic and historic sites, and flood<br />\nplains. It generally follows the major stream and river valleys. Other parts<br />\nof the primary system include other water bodies, smaller scenic valleys and<br />\nhistoric sites, available open space around the headwaters of other rivers,<br />\nand scattered but significant public recreation sites along the bay.<br />\n<br />\nactivities, educational facilities, and numerous other aspects of daily urban<br />\nliving.<br />\n<br />\nThe plan shows a development pattern which can improve these oppor-<br />\ntunities and make them more available to more people.<br />\n<br />\nA strong central core for the Region is explicit in the plan \u2014 from the<br />\nstrengthened highway network and the rail mass-transit system to the<br />\nrevitalized high-density residential districts in the central area. These<br />\n<br />\n. features work to reinforce the core as a thriving financial, business, resi-<br />\ndential, and cultural center supporting the economy of the Region, and<br />\nserving as a vital center of activity around the clock.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to a strong downtown, a number of town centers are proposed<br />\nto serve as secondary concentrations of business and other activity. These<br />\ncenters will offer a variety of urban opportunities including retail, com-<br />\nmercial services, and entertainment facilities. They can include govern-<br />\nment, educational, institutional, and residential complexes. Many, like<br />\nthe centers .of Towson and Annapolis, exist today. They are all located<br />\namid large existing and future communities and are closely coordinated<br />\nwith the transportation system, both highway and transit.<br />\n<br />\nAs the growth of the area continues, new carefully planned centers<br />\nshould be created in presently undeveloped areas to serve these new com-<br />\nmunities.<br />\n<br />\nIndustrial Land<br />\n<br />\nGood industrial land is essential for the economic growth of any populous<br />\nregion. Thousands of additional acres of land must be reserved for indus-<br />\ntrial expansion in coming decades. At the present time, the largest in-<br />\ndustrial establishments are located around the Patapsco waterfront. Smaller<br />\nindustrial developments are located throughout the Region.<br />\n<br />\nGood transportation, water and sewer facilities, and other services are<br />\nnecessary for industry.

The two major features in the system are highways and mass<br />\ntransit, both bus and rail.<br />\n<br />\nand Baltimore-Washington Parkway.<br />\n<br />\nMuch of the success of the General Development Plan depends on the<br />\npeople who live in the Region.
