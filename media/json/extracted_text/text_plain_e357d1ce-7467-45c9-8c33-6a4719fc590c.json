The most numerously represented<br />\ndivision, the wood-warblers ( Zanagride), are not fine<br />\nsingers, which mostly belong to the thrush and<br />\nmocking-bird family. The mocking-bird finds a<br />\ncongenial home in the lower lands of the State, and<br />\nmay be seen in both wild and cultivated grounds.<br />\nThis, with many other, especially Southern species,<br />\nfind here the northern limit of their range in Mary-<br />\nland. : ;<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nThe bobolink (Dolichonyz), of the hang-nest divi-<br />\nsion, may be trained to be almost equal to the best.<br />\nThe birds of prey, especially the hawks, are very<br />\nnumerous in species, while a single vulture (the<br />\nTurkey Buzzard) is extremely common.<br />\n<br />\nThe game species are but few, but among them<br />\nthat noblest of them all, the wild turkey. Two spe-<br />\ncies of grouse and a partridge complete the list. As a<br />\nseaboard State, Maryland is permanently inhabited<br />\nby numerous species of wading-birds. Several<br />\nspecies of herons are common along the streams, of<br />\nwhich Ardea herodias (the blue heron) is the largest,<br />\nas well as the most abundant, excepting, perhaps,<br />\nthe smaller Butorides virescens (Fly-up-the-Creek).<br />\nThe grass-snipe, which fills the evening with its wild<br />\nwhistle, represents its family in the rich meadows<br />\nthroughout the whole year; the wood-cock remains<br />\nin the thickets, while the true snipe migrates to the<br />\nNorth in spring.<br />\n<br />\nOwing to the possession of coast-line, and the<br />\ngreat inland bay of Chesapeake, the swimming-birds<br />\nare very numerous, especially the ZLamellirostral<br />\nforms, or geese, ducks, etc. They remain in im-<br />\nmense numbers in the bays of the coast and of the<br />\nChesapeake Bay during part of their autumn migra-<br />\ntion southward, or until cold weather overtakes<br />\nthem. Here the gunners and caterers of Baltimore<br />\nand Philadelphia betake themselves in numbers, and<br />\nwith decoys, blinds, flat-boats, and all the machinery<br />\nof destruction, slaughter thousands of these birds<br />\nfor the markets of their respective cities.<br />\n<br />\nThe red-head (Fuliz Americana), canvas-back (F.<br />\nvallisnerie), and blue-bill (F. mcwils), are most abun-<br />\ndant. The Canada goose and brant mingle in great<br />\nflocks, and a single species of swan (Cygnus Ameri<br />\ncanus) is not rare, but is shy.<br />\n<br />\nThe wood-duck (4ix sponsa) is known throughout<br />\nthe State during the year, but most of the species<br />\nenter the rivers and ponds on their southern mi-<br />\ngration. The loons remain all winter. Numerous<br />\ngulls fish in the rivers and in Chesapeake Bay.<br />\n<br />\nAmong the reptiles; Maryland is notable for th:<br />\nnumber of species of tortoises found within its<br />\nlimits, exceeding in this the European list several<br />\ntimes. The snapping-turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is<br />\nat home here, and the box-tortoise (Cistudo clausa) is<br />\nextremely abundant. The Chelopus Muhlenbergii is<br />\nconfined to the north-eastern portion of the State<br />\nand adjacent parts of New Jersey. Nearly all the<br />\nspecies are valuable as food, and the \u00a2terrapin,\u201d<br />\nMalaclemnys palustris, Plychemys rugosa (red belly),<br />\nand the snapper, are sold in large numbers in the -<br />\nBaltimore market.<br />\n\u00a9 Of the 23 species of snakes, only two are venom-<br />\nous: these are, the copperhead (Ancistrodon con-<br />\ntortrix), found everywhere where not exterminated ;<br />\nand the common rattlesnake (Caudisona horrida),<br />\nwhich originally inhabited the whole country. Both<br />\nare dangerous, the rattlesnake occasionally attaining<br />\na length of six feet; but they are both exterminated<br />\nfrom the best-settled regions. The remaining twenty<br />\nspecies, where not too small (five species might be so<br />\nreckoned), are very useful animals in destroying<br />\nmice, moles, and other vermin, and are preserved by<br />\nintelligent farmers on this account. I have taken<br />\nthree meadow-mice (Arvicolz) from the stomach of<br />\none black snake (Bascanion constrictor), and have<br />\nfound a house-snake (Ophibolous triangulus) with an<br />\nArvicola in its mouth, and two others held in two<br />\nseparate coils of the body, awaiting their turn to be<br />\nswallowed. : .<br />\n<br />\nOur State is very poorly supplied with lizards; but<br />\nthose creatures which most resemble them, the Sala-<br />\nmanders, are perhaps more numerously represented<br />\nby species than in any other country of equal area<br />\nin the world, excepting some of the Southern States.<br />\nThere are eighteen species of this group (Batrachia<br />\nUrodela), most of which are small.

The mocking-bird finds a<br />\ncongenial home in the lower lands of the State, and<br />\nmay be seen in both wild and cultivated grounds.<br />\nThis, with many other, especially Southern species,<br />\nfind here the northern limit of their range in Mary-<br />\nland. : ;<br /><br /><br /><br />\nThe bobolink (Dolichonyz), of the hang-nest divi-<br />\nsion, may be trained to be almost equal to the best.<br />\nThe birds of prey, especially the hawks, are very<br />\nnumerous in species, while a single vulture (the<br />\nTurkey Buzzard) is extremely common.<br /><br />\nThe game species are but few, but among them<br />\nthat noblest of them all, the wild turkey. Two spe-<br />\ncies of grouse and a partridge complete the list. As a<br />\nseaboard State, Maryland is permanently inhabited<br />\nby numerous species of wading-birds. Several<br />\nspecies of herons are common along the streams, of<br />\nwhich Ardea herodias (the blue heron) is the largest,<br />\nas well as the most abundant, excepting, perhaps,<br />\nthe smaller Butorides virescens (Fly-up-the-Creek).<br />\nThe grass-snipe, which fills the evening with its wild<br />\nwhistle, represents its family in the rich meadows<br />\nthroughout the whole year; the wood-cock remains<br />\nin the thickets, while the true snipe migrates to the<br />\nNorth in spring.<br /><br />\nOwing to the possession of coast-line, and the<br />\ngreat inland bay of Chesapeake, the swimming-birds<br />\nare very numerous, especially the ZLamellirostral<br />\nforms, or geese, ducks, etc. They remain in im-<br />\nmense numbers in the bays of the coast and of the<br />\nChesapeake Bay during part of their autumn migra-<br />\ntion southward, or until cold weather overtakes<br />\nthem. Here the gunners and caterers of Baltimore<br />\nand Philadelphia betake themselves in numbers, and<br />\nwith decoys, blinds, flat-boats, and all the machinery<br />\nof destruction, slaughter thousands of these birds<br />\nfor the markets of their respective cities.<br /><br />\nThe red-head (Fuliz Americana), canvas-back (F.<br />\nvallisnerie), and blue-bill (F. mcwils), are most abun-<br />\ndant. The Canada goose and brant mingle in great<br />\nflocks, and a single species of swan (Cygnus Ameri<br />\ncanus) is not rare, but is shy.<br /><br />\nThe wood-duck (4ix sponsa) is known throughout<br />\nthe State during the year, but most of the species<br />\nenter the rivers and ponds on their southern mi-<br />\ngration. The loons remain all winter. Numerous<br />\ngulls fish in the rivers and in Chesapeake Bay.<br /><br />\nAmong the reptiles; Maryland is notable for th:<br />\nnumber of species of tortoises found within its<br />\nlimits, exceeding in this the European list several<br />\ntimes. The snapping-turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is<br />\nat home here, and the box-tortoise (Cistudo clausa) is<br />\nextremely abundant. The Chelopus Muhlenbergii is<br />\nconfined to the north-eastern portion of the State<br />\nand adjacent parts of New Jersey. Nearly all the<br />\nspecies are valuable as food, and the \u00a2terrapin,\u201d<br />\nMalaclemnys palustris, Plychemys rugosa (red belly),<br />\nand the snapper, are sold in large numbers in the -<br />\nBaltimore market.<br />\n\u00a9 Of the 23 species of snakes, only two are venom-<br />\nous: these are, the copperhead (Ancistrodon con-<br />\ntortrix), found everywhere where not exterminated ;<br />\nand the common rattlesnake (Caudisona horrida),<br />\nwhich originally inhabited the whole country. Both<br />\nare dangerous, the rattlesnake occasionally attaining<br />\na length of six feet; but they are both exterminated<br />\nfrom the best-settled regions. The remaining twenty<br />\nspecies, where not too small (five species might be so<br />\nreckoned), are very useful animals in destroying<br />\nmice, moles, and other vermin, and are preserved by<br />\nintelligent farmers on this account. I have taken<br />\nthree meadow-mice (Arvicolz) from the stomach of<br />\none black snake (Bascanion constrictor), and have<br />\nfound a house-snake (Ophibolous triangulus) with an<br />\nArvicola in its mouth, and two others held in two<br />\nseparate coils of the body, awaiting their turn to be<br />\nswallowed. : .<br /><br />\nOur State is very poorly supplied with lizards; but<br />\nthose creatures which most resemble them, the Sala-<br />\nmanders, are perhaps more numerously represented<br />\nby species than in any other country of equal area<br />\nin the world, excepting some of the Southern States.<br />\nThere are eighteen species of this group (Batrachia<br />\nUrodela), most of which are small. The second in<br />\nsize in the world, however (Protonopsis horrida), the<br />\nmud alligator or water-dog, occurs in the tributaries<br />\nof the Youghiogheny, and has been caught occasion-<br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 51975, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "d6130a0e-e75f-443e-858a-a52171fc0787", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/15666-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 15666, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "9a872e7c-0c96-442b-abf9-570199ea3f55", "url": "/node/15666"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "4192f639-7c34-4964-9f69-ac41d92cf5c5"}]}
