It was the regular<br />\nMonday Morning Quarter-backing session and we really chewed<br />\n:the game over. We talked about Western Maryland's using only<br />\nfifteen players all afternoon, about Eddie Miller's 74 yard quick<br />\nkick, and how the Hopkins band thoroughly killed the Western<br />\n, Maryland school song.<br />\nThe conversation just drifted along until someone asked<br />\n\"Who's going to take Lou Koerber's place next year?\" We all<br />\n\u2022 thought for a minute until somebody came up with the only logical answer\u2014\"Who can?\"<br />\nPOETIC JUSTICE<br />\nAnd looking back on it, there is no one boy that can step into<br />\nthe athletic shoes of the shy, young boy from McDonough School.<br />\nIt is not just the eight varsity letters and the Mason-Dixon wrestling championship that Lou has won at Hopkins that will make<br />\nhis slate hard to match. It will be his will to win, his devotion to<br />\nhis team, and his unflagging spirit.<br />\nIt is no secret that Lou's punt returns kept the Jays in the<br />\nWestern Maryland game. Without the yardage that he piled up,<br />\nthe Black and Blue would have spent the entire afternoon in the<br />\nshadow of their own goalpost. It was poetic justice of a sort that<br />\nlet Lou score the tieing touchdown on the paying end of Eddie<br />\nMiller's long past<br />\nIt was also justice of a sort that finally let Lou play offensive<br />\nfootball after absorbing nearly two full years of punishment as<br />\nstrictly defensive ballplayer, and 165 pounds is not a lot of physical equipment to be playing defense with.<br />\nTHREE TIMES A CAPTAIN<br />\nTwice Lou's football mates honored him with the greatest<br />\ns I thing they could do for him. In 1947 and again in 1948 he captained the Jay grid squad. The baseball team also chose him as<br />\n\u2022 their '47 leader. No more clear-cut idea of the quality of Lou's<br />\nleadership can be made. To go on and list the class, fraternity and<br />\norganizational positions that he has held in his stay at the Hopkins<br />\nis unnecessary.<br />\nWe will all remember Lou's last game on the football field and<br />\n\u2022 'We are only sorry that we will have<br />\nto wait until he again holds<br />\ndown his third base position in the spring before we can again<br />\nsee him play.

It was the regular<br />\nMonday Morning Quarter-backing session and we really chewed<br />\n:the game over. We talked about Western Maryland's using only<br />\nfifteen players all afternoon, about Eddie Miller's 74 yard quick<br />\nkick, and how the Hopkins band thoroughly killed the Western<br />\n, Maryland school song.<br />\nThe conversation just drifted along until someone asked<br />\n\"Who's going to take Lou Koerber's place next year?\" We all<br />\n\u2022 thought for a minute until somebody came up with the only logical answer\u2014\"Who can?\"<br />\nPOETIC JUSTICE<br />\nAnd looking back on it, there is no one boy that can step into<br />\nthe athletic shoes of the shy, young boy from McDonough School.<br />\nIt is not just the eight varsity letters and the Mason-Dixon wrestling championship that Lou has won at Hopkins that will make<br />\nhis slate hard to match. It will be his will to win, his devotion to<br />\nhis team, and his unflagging spirit.<br />\nIt is no secret that Lou's punt returns kept the Jays in the<br />\nWestern Maryland game. Without the yardage that he piled up,<br />\nthe Black and Blue would have spent the entire afternoon in the<br />\nshadow of their own goalpost. It was poetic justice of a sort that<br />\nlet Lou score the tieing touchdown on the paying end of Eddie<br />\nMiller's long past<br />\nIt was also justice of a sort that finally let Lou play offensive<br />\nfootball after absorbing nearly two full years of punishment as<br />\nstrictly defensive ballplayer, and 165 pounds is not a lot of physical equipment to be playing defense with.<br />\nTHREE TIMES A CAPTAIN<br />\nTwice Lou's football mates honored him with the greatest<br />\ns I thing they could do for him. In 1947 and again in 1948 he captained the Jay grid squad. The baseball team also chose him as<br />\n\u2022 their '47 leader. No more clear-cut idea of the quality of Lou's<br />\nleadership can be made. To go on and list the class, fraternity and<br />\norganizational positions that he has held in his stay at the Hopkins<br />\nis unnecessary.<br />\nWe will all remember Lou's last game on the football field and<br />\n\u2022 'We are only sorry that we will have<br />\nto wait until he again holds<br />\ndown his third base position in the spring before we can again<br />\nsee him play.
