According to a recent announcement he<br />\nexpects to uncover much more of<br />\nwhat he terms the first classical city<br />\nto be excavated with whole blocks<br />\nof private houses, filled with art objects of the first importance.<br />\nThe mystery of the \"Main Street\"<br />\nof this ancient Hellenic city, destroyed in 348 B. C. by Phillip of<br />\nMacedon, father of Alexander the<br />\nGreat, has especially attracted the<br />\nHopkins man's interest. He wants<br />\nto continue his excavations of this<br />\nantique thoroughfare, because he<br />\nfeels certain that it led to the public<br />\nsquare of this city. Here he expects<br />\nto uncover material which may<br />\nradically change certain chapters of<br />\nGreek history.<br />\nOlynthus Was Capital<br />\nFor Olynthus was the capital of<br />\nthe Chalcidic League, a group of<br />\nimportant cities, and it is possible,<br />\nDi-.
