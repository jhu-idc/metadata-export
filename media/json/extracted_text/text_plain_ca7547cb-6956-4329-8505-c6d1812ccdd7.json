And in the past the Booster<br />\nClub has made efforts to arouse the campus from its<br />\napathy. But, in all fairness, the fiasco of last week's<br />\naborted pep rally was not wholly due to student apathy.<br />\nAs a wise sage once commented \"it ain't what you<br />\ndo, but the way you do it.\" And the pep rally was a<br />\nperfect example of inept planning anti execution. Publicity for the event was little or non-existent and no<br />\nannouncement was made at the freshman football game.<br />\nBut the concept of bow and when to hold the pep<br />\nrally was the true cause of its failure. In the first place<br />\nit is doubtful that even the most rabid Hopkins rooter<br />\nderives any thrill from seeing football players parade<br />\npast the stands or hearing the coach make several<br />\ncautious remarks about the probability of winning<br />\ntomorrow's game. The essence of a pep rally is just<br />\nwhat the name implies, pep.<br />\nThe ingredients of a sucessful pep rally include a<br />\nscene of confusion and noise, a band, a lion-fire, songs,<br />\nand people yelling, shouting anti having fun. Basically<br />\nit is a controlled riot with the avowed purpose of cheering<br />\non the team's stalwarts and,.the real purpose of letting go<br />\nA pep rally which does not<br />\nand having some fun.<br />\napproximate this type of situation is doomed to failure.<br />\nIt would appear that the Booster Club planned this<br />\npep rally only so that it could say that it tried. But the fact<br />\nis that the Booster Club did not try. Thus last week's<br />\nflop is not a reflection on the student body so much as<br />\nit is an indication of the capabilities of the 'Booster Club.<br />\n<br />\nPEP Rally?<br />\nNow that the furor over the eligibility of a certain<br />\nfreshman petition has died down it might be wise to<br />\nexamine the nature anti cause of the complaints.<br />\nIn the first place we note that hardly an election<br />\ngoes by without some confusion over the rules or the<br />\nlegality of various petitions. This regularity of complaints indicates that, at the very least, a clarification of<br />\nelection rules is necessary and that such a clarification<br />\nshould well precede the next election. The Student Council action on this matter was well advised and is a step<br />\nin the right direction.<br />\nSecondly, it is not apparent why the SAC is in any<br />\nway connected with election procedures. It would seem<br />\nobvious that this is the sole responsibility of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe third and most important poin to be noted is<br />\nthe place fraternity politics can be accused of playing in<br />\nthe election procedures. The confusion this year is a<br />\nease in point. A freshman's petition for vice president<br />\nof his class was refused, first on the grounds of being<br />\nseconds late. When the absurdity of this situation was<br />\npointed out, the same petition was rejected for having<br />\none too few signatures even though this shortage was not<br />\nthe fault of the freshman.<br />\nTaking into account the fact that if this petition had<br />\nbeen refused, only one candidate, a member of Phi<br />\nEpsilon Pi, would run for the office and the fact that the<br />\npetition was refused on the above stated flimsy grounds<br />\nby a member of the same fraternity, it is apparent how<br />\nsuch a charge of fraternity politics could be made.<br />\nWhether this was, indeed, an instance of fraternity<br />\npolitics or not is beside the point. What matters is tfiat<br />\nsuch an issue could arise in the first place. It would<br />\nseem that our student government could he run in such<br />\na manner that (+rages of this nature would not arise.<br />\n<br />\n\"Students are more in line<br />\nthis year than the past four,\"<br />\nmused Mr. Joseph Thompson last<br />\nweek, as he surveyed his ninetyacre Homewood beat from his<br />\nshiny new police car.<br />\n<br />\nfaithfully attend classes at the<br />\nbeginning of the week.

The<br />\nconservative tide is making an<br />\nattempt to erode that awesome<br />\nbank of apathy which has immersed the Hopkins' man since<br />\nthe days of the great transition<br />\nfrom Wilson to Harding. William<br />\nBuckley, articulate editor of the<br />\nNational Review, will doubtless<br />\nabet the movement with a visit<br />\nin the spring. The fledgling \"Conservative Association\" is at the<br />\npresent time merely a reflection<br />\nof the new interest but is striving for a commanding role in the<br />\nreawakening of the right.<br />\n<br />\naghast at her unabashed opinions<br />\nand surprisingly many of the<br />\n\"enlightened\" were hard put to<br />\ncounter them. Remarks such as<br />\n\"first departure from the verbal<br />\ndribble I've'heard in a long time\"<br />\nand \"her confidence was convincing\" pervaded her reception<br />\nas discussion quickly jumped into<br />\ndispute. The'implication for the<br />\nfuture is for increased agitation<br />\nof the stilled waters, to say the<br />\nleast.<br />\n<br />\nViewing this phenomenon with<br />\nthe habitual university-like air of<br />\ndetachment, one is struck at the<br />\nessential negativism of the conservative assault on the already<br />\nwell-punctured values and attitudes of American society.<br />\nRanging from the mildy caustic<br />\nMiss Rand left many people exhortations of the National Re-<br />\n<br />\nview, to the nihilistic rightisrn<br />\nof the extremist Rands, this is<br />\nreadily apparent. Although the<br />\nguns from the right salvo both<br />\neconomic and political trends, it<br />\nseems as if their greatest impact<br />\non mass appeal is in the sphere<br />\nof politics in general, and that<br />\nfrustrating field of foreign affairs<br />\nin particular. Ayn Rand moved<br />\nclosest to a rapport with her<br />\nShriver audience in a reference<br />\nto \"crawling to Moscow with Bertrand Russell,\" and Senator<br />\nGoldwater hits more headlines<br />\ncommenting on Red China, and<br />\n\"winning the cold war.\"<br />\nAs the realization of the United State's inability to completely control its destiny filtered<br />\ndown to the public, words such<br />\nas \"self-realiance\" and \"individ-<br />\n<br />\nCheck your opinions against LM's Campus Opinion Poll 10<br />\n<br />\nualism\" crept back into the<br />\npolitical lexicon, and were brandished about with increasing ease<br />\nby the new conservatives.

And in the past the Booster<br />\nClub has made efforts to arouse the campus from its<br />\napathy. But, in all fairness, the fiasco of last week's<br />\naborted pep rally was not wholly due to student apathy.<br />\nAs a wise sage once commented \"it ain't what you<br />\ndo, but the way you do it.\" And the pep rally was a<br />\nperfect example of inept planning anti execution. Publicity for the event was little or non-existent and no<br />\nannouncement was made at the freshman football game.<br />\nBut the concept of bow and when to hold the pep<br />\nrally was the true cause of its failure. In the first place<br />\nit is doubtful that even the most rabid Hopkins rooter<br />\nderives any thrill from seeing football players parade<br />\npast the stands or hearing the coach make several<br />\ncautious remarks about the probability of winning<br />\ntomorrow's game. The essence of a pep rally is just<br />\nwhat the name implies, pep.<br />\nThe ingredients of a sucessful pep rally include a<br />\nscene of confusion and noise, a band, a lion-fire, songs,<br />\nand people yelling, shouting anti having fun. Basically<br />\nit is a controlled riot with the avowed purpose of cheering<br />\non the team's stalwarts and,.the real purpose of letting go<br />\nA pep rally which does not<br />\nand having some fun.<br />\napproximate this type of situation is doomed to failure.<br />\nIt would appear that the Booster Club planned this<br />\npep rally only so that it could say that it tried. But the fact<br />\nis that the Booster Club did not try. Thus last week's<br />\nflop is not a reflection on the student body so much as<br />\nit is an indication of the capabilities of the 'Booster Club.<br /><br />\nPEP Rally?<br />\nNow that the furor over the eligibility of a certain<br />\nfreshman petition has died down it might be wise to<br />\nexamine the nature anti cause of the complaints.<br />\nIn the first place we note that hardly an election<br />\ngoes by without some confusion over the rules or the<br />\nlegality of various petitions. This regularity of complaints indicates that, at the very least, a clarification of<br />\nelection rules is necessary and that such a clarification<br />\nshould well precede the next election. The Student Council action on this matter was well advised and is a step<br />\nin the right direction.<br />\nSecondly, it is not apparent why the SAC is in any<br />\nway connected with election procedures. It would seem<br />\nobvious that this is the sole responsibility of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe third and most important poin to be noted is<br />\nthe place fraternity politics can be accused of playing in<br />\nthe election procedures. The confusion this year is a<br />\nease in point. A freshman's petition for vice president<br />\nof his class was refused, first on the grounds of being<br />\nseconds late. When the absurdity of this situation was<br />\npointed out, the same petition was rejected for having<br />\none too few signatures even though this shortage was not<br />\nthe fault of the freshman.<br />\nTaking into account the fact that if this petition had<br />\nbeen refused, only one candidate, a member of Phi<br />\nEpsilon Pi, would run for the office and the fact that the<br />\npetition was refused on the above stated flimsy grounds<br />\nby a member of the same fraternity, it is apparent how<br />\nsuch a charge of fraternity politics could be made.<br />\nWhether this was, indeed, an instance of fraternity<br />\npolitics or not is beside the point. What matters is tfiat<br />\nsuch an issue could arise in the first place. It would<br />\nseem that our student government could he run in such<br />\na manner that (+rages of this nature would not arise.<br /><br />\n\"Students are more in line<br />\nthis year than the past four,\"<br />\nmused Mr. Joseph Thompson last<br />\nweek, as he surveyed his ninetyacre Homewood beat from his<br />\nshiny new police car.<br /><br />\nfaithfully attend classes at the<br />\nbeginning of the week.

Ayn<br />\nRand's recent incendiary speech<br />\ndetonated a thermonuclear shock<br />\nwave of conservatism that may<br />\nonly subside when Barry Goldwater becomes President. The<br />\nconservative tide is making an<br />\nattempt to erode that awesome<br />\nbank of apathy which has immersed the Hopkins' man since<br />\nthe days of the great transition<br />\nfrom Wilson to Harding. William<br />\nBuckley, articulate editor of the<br />\nNational Review, will doubtless<br />\nabet the movement with a visit<br />\nin the spring. The fledgling \"Conservative Association\" is at the<br />\npresent time merely a reflection<br />\nof the new interest but is striving for a commanding role in the<br />\nreawakening of the right.<br /><br />\naghast at her unabashed opinions<br />\nand surprisingly many of the<br />\n\"enlightened\" were hard put to<br />\ncounter them. Remarks such as<br />\n\"first departure from the verbal<br />\ndribble I've'heard in a long time\"<br />\nand \"her confidence was convincing\" pervaded her reception<br />\nas discussion quickly jumped into<br />\ndispute. The'implication for the<br />\nfuture is for increased agitation<br />\nof the stilled waters, to say the<br />\nleast.<br /><br />\nViewing this phenomenon with<br />\nthe habitual university-like air of<br />\ndetachment, one is struck at the<br />\nessential negativism of the conservative assault on the already<br />\nwell-punctured values and attitudes of American society.<br />\nRanging from the mildy caustic<br />\nMiss Rand left many people exhortations of the National Re-<br /><br />\nview, to the nihilistic rightisrn<br />\nof the extremist Rands, this is<br />\nreadily apparent. Although the<br />\nguns from the right salvo both<br />\neconomic and political trends, it<br />\nseems as if their greatest impact<br />\non mass appeal is in the sphere<br />\nof politics in general, and that<br />\nfrustrating field of foreign affairs<br />\nin particular. Ayn Rand moved<br />\nclosest to a rapport with her<br />\nShriver audience in a reference<br />\nto \"crawling to Moscow with Bertrand Russell,\" and Senator<br />\nGoldwater hits more headlines<br />\ncommenting on Red China, and<br />\n\"winning the cold war.\"<br />\nAs the realization of the United State's inability to completely control its destiny filtered<br />\ndown to the public, words such<br />\nas \"self-realiance\" and \"individ-<br /><br />\nCheck your opinions against LM's Campus Opinion Poll 10<br /><br />\nualism\" crept back into the<br />\npolitical lexicon, and were brandished about with increasing ease<br />\nby the new conservatives.
