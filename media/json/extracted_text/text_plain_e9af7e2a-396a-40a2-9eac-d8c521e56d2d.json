David<br />\nLevy will occupy the managerial role,<br />\nwhile Albert Hutzler was elected junior assistant.<br />\nHazlett, a veteran with two years<br />\nof varsity experience, has built up an<br />\nenviable record in the tank sport. He<br />\nhas proved himself one of the most<br />\nconsistent first-place winners on the<br />\nteam, capturing five out of the seven<br />\nraces in his specialty, the 200-yard<br />\nbreaststroke.
