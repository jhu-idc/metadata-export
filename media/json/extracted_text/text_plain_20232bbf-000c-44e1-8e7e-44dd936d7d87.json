But<br />\nas the twilight mists cast an ever thickening veil over the picturesque Baltimore Stadium, the ancient rivals, Hopkins and<br />\n, ,Maryland, had struggled to a deadlock.<br />\nJust one year later, the foes met again, each determined<br />\n.to capture the laurels of victory. But again nightfall witnessed no snake dance, nor did the horseshoe tremble with the<br />\nyells of victory\u2014mad thousands. Hopkins and Maryland had<br />\nfought bravely, valiantly, heroically, but neither had attained<br />\nvictory.<br />\nAnother year has elapsed, and we find ourselves on\u2022 the<br />\nbrink of another great struggle, the greatest struggle. Thursday's game will be great because all of the imprisoned enthusiasm of three years is straining for release. It will be great<br />\n, because a mighty battle of three years' duration\u2014unless history repeats itself\u2014will be decided.<br />\nWe can beat Maryland. We feel it. We believe it. But<br />\nour team is facing a formidable foe in Maryland. This is no<br />\ntime for passive belief. We must let the men who are fighting<br />\nfor us know that we are with them; that we have faith in them;<br />\nthat we know they are going to win; that we appreciate what<br />\nthey are doing for us.

The argument which they started<br />\n,has waxed and wanted, has sounded loud, has sounded almost<br />\nnot at all, but it has been kept lip to the present day, and at<br />\npresent is attracting quite an unusual amount of attention.<br />\nThe latest manifestation of the brawl is the vote carried<br />\nson by two enterprising Harvard undergraduates. \"Would<br />\nHarvard trade President Lowell and other members of the<br />\nfaculty for a good running backfield, or would Harvard refuse<br />\nto exchange one item of academic prestige for the best football team in history, with a herd of'newspaper propagandists<br />\n'thrown in?\" is their query.<br />\nThe fact that President Lowell and academic prestige won<br />\nhands down would indicate that at least one college has reached<br />\na partial solution to the vexing problem of football versus<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nHowever, the NEWS-LETTER is a bit curious. It wonders<br />\nif the undergraduate body, the coach, the team, and the alumni<br />\nwould not be willing to part with one or two instructors for<br />\na. victory over Maryland.

But<br />\nas the twilight mists cast an ever thickening veil over the picturesque Baltimore Stadium, the ancient rivals, Hopkins and<br />\n, ,Maryland, had struggled to a deadlock.<br />\nJust one year later, the foes met again, each determined<br />\n.to capture the laurels of victory. But again nightfall witnessed no snake dance, nor did the horseshoe tremble with the<br />\nyells of victory\u2014mad thousands. Hopkins and Maryland had<br />\nfought bravely, valiantly, heroically, but neither had attained<br />\nvictory.<br />\nAnother year has elapsed, and we find ourselves on\u2022 the<br />\nbrink of another great struggle, the greatest struggle. Thursday's game will be great because all of the imprisoned enthusiasm of three years is straining for release. It will be great<br />\n, because a mighty battle of three years' duration\u2014unless history repeats itself\u2014will be decided.<br />\nWe can beat Maryland. We feel it. We believe it. But<br />\nour team is facing a formidable foe in Maryland. This is no<br />\ntime for passive belief. We must let the men who are fighting<br />\nfor us know that we are with them; that we have faith in them;<br />\nthat we know they are going to win; that we appreciate what<br />\nthey are doing for us. We must be with them on every play.<br />\nOur -yells will help them to push forward or to hold.

The argument which they started<br />\n,has waxed and wanted, has sounded loud, has sounded almost<br />\nnot at all, but it has been kept lip to the present day, and at<br />\npresent is attracting quite an unusual amount of attention.<br />\nThe latest manifestation of the brawl is the vote carried<br />\nson by two enterprising Harvard undergraduates. \"Would<br />\nHarvard trade President Lowell and other members of the<br />\nfaculty for a good running backfield, or would Harvard refuse<br />\nto exchange one item of academic prestige for the best football team in history, with a herd of'newspaper propagandists<br />\n'thrown in?\" is their query.<br />\nThe fact that President Lowell and academic prestige won<br />\nhands down would indicate that at least one college has reached<br />\na partial solution to the vexing problem of football versus<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nHowever, the NEWS-LETTER is a bit curious. It wonders<br />\nif the undergraduate body, the coach, the team, and the alumni<br />\nwould not be willing to part with one or two instructors for<br />\na. victory over Maryland.
