On the map each of these<br /><br />\nfeatures is represented, dlrect.ly beneath its position in the<br />\nsketch, by contour lines.<br /><br />\nThe contour-interval, or the vertical dmtanoe in feet between<br />\none contour and the next, is stated at the bottom of each map.<br />\nThis interval differs according to the topography of the area<br />\nmapped: in a flat country it may be as small as 1 foot; in &amp;<br />\nmountainous region it may be as great as 250 feet. Certain<br /><br />\n\" contour lines, every fourth or fifth one, are made heavier than<br /><br />\nthe others and are accompanied by figures showing altitude.<br />\nThe heights of many points\u2014such as road corners, summits,<br />\nsurfaces of lakes, and bench marks\u2014are also given on the map<br />\nin figures, which show altitudes to the nearest foot only. More<br />\nexact altitudes\u2014those of bench marks\u2014as well as the geodetic<br />\ncoordinates of triangulation stations, are publiehed in bulletins<br />\nissued by the Geological Survey.<br /><br />\nLettermg and the works of man are shown in bla.ck Bound-<br />\naries, such as those of a State, county, city, land grant, town-<br />\nship, or reservation, are shown by continuous or broken lmes<br />\n\u2018of different kinds and weights. . Metaled roads are shown' by<br />\ndouble lines, one of which is accentuated. Other pubhc roads<br /><br />\n- are shown by fine double lines, private and poor roads by:<br /><br />\ndashed double lines, trails by dashed single lines. - :<br /><br />\nEach quadrangle is deelgnated by the name of a city, town, -<br />\nor prominent natural feature within it, and on the margins of<br />\nthe map are printed the names of adjoining quadrangles of<br />\nwhich maps have been published. Over 3,000 quadrangles in<br />\nthe United States have been surveyed, and maps of them<br />\nsimilar to the one on the other side of this sheet h&amp;ve been<br />\npublished.<br /><br />\nThe topographlc map is the base on which t.he geo10gy and<br />\nmineral resources of a quadrangle are represented, and the<br />\nmaps showing these features are bound together with a descrip-<br /><br />\n' tive text to form a folio of the Geologic Atlas of the United<br /><br />\nStates. More than 200 folios have been published.<br /><br />\nIndex maps of each State and of Alaska and Hawaii showing<br />\nthe areas covered by topographic maps and geologic folios pub-<br />\nlished by the United States Geological Survey may be obtained<br />\nfree. Copies of the standard topographic maps may be obtained<br /><br />\n- for 10 cents each; some special maps are sold at different prices.<br />\nA discount of 40 per cent is allowed on an order for maps<br /><br />\namounting to $5 of more at the retail price. The geologic<br />\nfolios are sold for 25 cents or more each, the price depending<br />\non the size of the folio. A circular describing the folios will<br />\nbe sent on request.<br /><br />\nApplications for maps or folios should be aocompamed by<br />\ncash, draft, or money order (not postage smmps) and should be<br />\naddressed to<br /><br />\nTHE DIREC\u2019I\u2018OR ;<br />\nUnited States Geologwal Survey,<br />\n- Washangton, D.
