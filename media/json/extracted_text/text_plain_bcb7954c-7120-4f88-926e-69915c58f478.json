Hollis, Stephen Tulloss<br />\nPeter Caloger<br />\nAndrew Green<br />\nJay Lenrow<br />\nRussell Lemle<br />\n<br />\nUndergrad Report<br />\nThe Student Council has finally completed its report<br />\non undergraduate education.<br />\nIts key recommendations are fourfold. First, that all<br />\narea majors be eliminated in favor of a return to the old<br />\ndepartmental system. The switch from department to<br />\narea majors was made three years ago in order to afford<br />\nstudents more flexibility. In that sense, it has done its<br />\njob.<br />\nHowever, since most matters of academic<br />\ngovernance swing on departmental hinges, it has taken<br />\nundergraduates out of a position to participate in<br />\ndecision-making at the most important level--the<br />\ndepartmental. What we suggest is a compromise-simply an option for area or departmental majors.<br />\nThis would enable the student to maintain maximum<br />\nflexibility while, at the same time, by including a<br />\nprovision to let an area major declare a departmental<br />\naffiliation, allow him the chance to be included in<br />\ndepartmental governance.<br />\nsupport<br />\nthe<br />\nsecond<br />\nWe<br />\nwholeheartedly<br />\nrecommendation of the SC committee. It urges that<br />\nteaching capabilities be weighted equally with<br />\npublishing and research in faculty hiring and promotion<br />\nconsiderations. Such a balance is the only way to insure<br />\nundergraduates a fair shake.<br />\nThe committee's report thirdly calls for the<br />\nimplementation of a one-man one-course requirement,<br />\nwhereby, except in special cases, each department<br />\nwould have to offer a minimum of one course to<br />\nundergraduates for each of its professors. This<br />\narrangement, as we have said before, is certainly<br />\njustifiable and has a strong base in University<br />\ntraditions.<br />\nFourthly, the committee urges that one-third of the<br />\nfaculty be required to offer seminars open to all each<br />\nsemester and that these seminars be limited to fifteen<br />\nstudents. The incongruity of the numbers game aside,<br />\nthe area of seminar education is probably the most<br />\noverbilled and underplayed at Hopkins. Although we<br />\nare not certain that an absolute one-third guideline<br />\nwould be desirable, we are certain that almost anything<br />\nwould be an improvement.<br />\n<br />\nMinority Hiring<br />\nThe latest victims of the University's financial crisis<br />\nare black and women employees. There has been a<br />\ndrastic hiring slow-down, and more jobs seem likely to<br />\nbe cut as a result of the fiscal woes that have hit all<br />\nUniversity divisions. The low minority percentages in<br />\nmost job categories have not changed since last year.<br />\nAnd one of the more glaring flaws in University policy-the incredible lack of black faculty--has even worsened.<br />\nLast year, there were 19 token black faculty out of 1,285<br />\nin all of the Baltimore divisions; this year there are only<br />\n8-- and none of them are at Homewood. Dean Benton's<br />\nprotestations of good intent notwithstanding, the<br />\nUniversity is failing miserably in filling this important<br />\nneed.<br />\nissuing<br />\nwill<br />\nbe<br />\nOffice<br />\nThe<br />\nPersonnel<br />\nrecommendations to Gordon,soon on how to best end<br />\nUniversity discrimination. This time around, the rest of<br />\nus should make sure , it is really done.<br />\n<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nTOO HASTY<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n_ Not all members of the<br />\nfaculty signed the recently<br />\ncirculated petition calling for<br />\na reduction in the Hopkins<br />\nadministration. Those of us<br />\nwho did not sign suffered the<br />\nusual fate of minorities of not<br />\nhaving<br />\nmuch<br />\nof<br />\nan<br />\nopportunity to present the<br />\nreasons for our actions.<br />\nIndeed, I am not sure whether<br />\nwe share reasons in common.<br />\nThe petition and the<br />\ncommittee report which<br />\nprovoked it seem to me to be<br />\na good example of hasty<br />\ncasting about to find a set of<br />\nvillains on which to fix the<br />\nblame for the present crisis of<br />\nthe University. University<br />\nadministrations are rarely<br />\nheroes to faculty and students<br />\nin the best of times and in<br />\nthese poor to bad times they<br />\nare the most vulnerable<br />\ncandidates for victimization.<br />\nI am not sure that Hopkins<br />\nspends more or less than it<br />\nshould for its administration: The Faculty committee<br />\nreport is too superficial an<br />\nanalysis to allow such judgments to be made. I do know<br />\nthat compared to other major<br />\nschools, Hopkins spends<br />\nproportionately less on its<br />\nadministration.<br />\nIn any event, it is not the<br />\nproportion<br />\nwhich<br />\nis<br />\nimportant, it is the quality of<br />\nessential services that is<br />\ncritical. An across-the-board<br />\ncut in administrative costs<br />\n<br />\nmay<br />\nnot<br />\nimprove<br />\nadministrative services:<br />\nIndeed it may actually lower<br />\nquality<br />\nand<br />\npresent<br />\ndifficulties in improving the<br />\nUniversity's position.<br />\nBefore doing anything<br />\nhasty, I would like to see a<br />\nthorough analysis of the<br />\nUniversity and its various<br />\nparts, including academic<br />\ndepartments. It can only be<br />\non the basis of understanding<br />\nhow well each of the<br />\ncomponents of the University<br />\nis functioning that you can<br />\nmake rational decisions<br />\nabout where expenditures<br />\ncan be cut without crippling<br />\n<br />\nthe ability of Hopkins to serve<br />\nits major goals.<br />\nPeter H.

Katherine Ross and Raquel Welch<br />\nhave been suggested, (their advocates<br />\nhastily adding that, really, they \"don't have<br />\ntime to go out\" but appreciate\"intelligent<br />\ngirls to talk to.\")<br />\nWhen asked about the future of<br />\ncoeducation at Hopkins and whether they<br />\nwould recommend JHU to other girls, the<br />\nresponses are enthusiastic and optimistic.<br />\nCecile Strauss points out that \"coeducation\"<br />\nat JHU this year consists of \"a few girls in<br />\nwhat is still a boy's school,\" but feels that<br />\nmore girls and more on-campus activity will<br />\nchange this.<br />\nAlthough most of the girls find the JHU<br />\nworkload fairly heavy, the majority of coeds<br />\nare used to \"booking\" and were pleased with<br />\ntheir first semester grades, as well as<br />\nclasses and professors. \"Smaller class<br />\nsizes, more course offerings, and more<br />\nprofessorial contact\" are among the<br />\nacademic changes Hopkins coeds desire.<br />\nIn the way of housing, transfer women<br />\nseem to be grateful to escape dorm living<br />\nand occasionally welcome the privacy of a<br />\nsingle in McCoy Hall. Kitchen facilities for<br />\nundergrad women appear to be a soughtafter item, however, and it is likely many<br />\ncoeds will try to obtain University owned<br />\nefficiency apartments next year.<br />\n<br />\n\f5-<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nFEBRUARY 9, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nParanoid's Progress: Saga of Melvin Gertz<br />\nThe following are excerpts<br />\nfrom a story about Melvin Gertz,<br />\nRutgers grad student, mediocre<br />\npoet and first martyr to the<br />\nNasal Hygiene Act of 1971,<br />\nwhich banned nose-picking.<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nThe bill, in its final form,<br />\nwas widely praised for being<br />\nextremely comprhensive.<br />\nThe key portion said, \"It is<br />\nhereby prohibited for a<br />\nperson to perform upon<br />\nhimself, or upon the person of<br />\nanother, the act of picking or<br />\nPecking at the nose, nostrils,<br />\nolfactory organ, snoot,<br />\nnozzle, muzzle, proboscis,<br />\nbeak, smeller, beezer, bugle,<br />\n<br />\nconk, schnozzle, schnozzola,<br />\nStiffer<br />\nnoseholes.\"<br />\nor<br />\npenalties were added for<br />\n\"rolling, playing, toying with,<br />\ntouching, bouncing, or<br />\notherwise having prolonged<br />\ncontact with said mucous<br />\nsubstance or substances.\" Of<br />\ngreatest<br />\nthe<br />\ncourse,<br />\npunishment, 25 years in jail<br />\nand/ or $10,000 fine, was<br />\nreserved for those unlucky<br />\nfelons who actually ate the<br />\nstuff.

Instead of<br />\nconcentrating on reducing<br />\nclass size, increasing course<br />\nofferings, and making the<br />\nfaculty bigshots teach more<br />\nthan a token course, the SC,<br />\nwith the ready help of the<br />\nadministration, is ready to<br />\nplan for a student union in a<br />\nbuilding discarded by the<br />\nadministration.<br />\nNothing like throwing<br />\nadministration scraps to the<br />\ndogs, especially<br />\nwhen<br />\nGordon's Gang has a new<br />\nPentagon that should have<br />\nbeen built for classrooms.<br />\nBut there are other reasons<br />\nwhy I think the student union<br />\nin Whitehead is a waste of<br />\neffort.<br />\n1. At a time when the last<br />\nfaculty hired might be the<br />\nfirst fired, (remember,<br />\nthey're the young ones who do<br />\nmost of the teaching), it<br />\nseems<br />\nand<br />\nridiculous<br />\nredundant to spend limited<br />\nmoney for a union that would<br />\nmerely duplicate present<br />\nfacilities....<br />\nJim Cleary is a senior.<br />\n<br />\n2. Not only would the<br />\nstudent union be redundant, it<br />\nwould also be rarely used.<br />\nHow many students want to<br />\nmake this campus a place<br />\nwhere they come to when<br />\nthey have nothing to do.<br />\nProbably very few. And since<br />\nan increasing number of<br />\nstudents live beyond walking<br />\ndistance to the campus, how<br />\nmany undergrads are going<br />\nto want to hop into the car for<br />\nan evening of relaxation at<br />\nthe very place that they<br />\nmoved far from to avoid.<br />\nNo Relaxation<br />\nDuring my four years here,<br />\nit seems to me that most<br />\nHopkins students want to get<br />\noff campus as soon as classes<br />\nare over and spend their free<br />\ntime in a place where they<br />\nare not continually shat upon<br />\nby faculty and administration. I really don't see how<br />\nwe could relax in a building<br />\nunder Massa Linc's authority<br />\nand which is guarded by Weinbach's Pinkertons.<br />\n3.

The horror<br />\nof this phenomenom is<br />\nimpossible to describe, but<br />\nimagine, if you dare, the<br />\nstench, the mangled fixtures,<br />\nthe perverted inscriptions<br />\nthat defiled its walls.<br />\nBy this time, Melvin was in<br />\na cold sweat. The vast men's<br />\nroom was carefully guarded<br />\nby one aging, fat Italian who<br />\nsquatted on a stool, in front of<br />\na row of towels, combs, and<br />\nhair tonics. The man<br />\nwandered away briefly.<br />\nAs soon as Melvin felt the<br />\ncoast was clear, he made a<br />\nquick dash down the row of<br />\npay toilets, looking under the<br />\ndoors for one that was vacant.<br />\nMelvin's razor-sharp mind<br />\nsoon grasped that most were<br />\noccupied, and he ran<br />\nfrantically up and down the<br />\naisle, all the while fancying<br />\nhimself as Gary Cooper on a<br />\ndangerous combat mission.<br />\n<br />\nEver-vigilent police on the prowlfor the nefarious desperado, Melvin Gertz.<br />\nAt last, he spied one that<br />\nwas vacant, hit the ground<br />\nlike a veteran soldier, and<br />\ncrawled on<br />\nhis<br />\nbelly<br />\nunderneath the locked door to<br />\nthe sweet sanctuary of the<br />\ntoilet bowl. And just in the<br />\nnick of time, too.<br />\nA smile of total bliss<br />\ncrossed our hero's face as he<br />\nunburdened himself. His<br />\nrevery<br />\nwas<br />\nrudely<br />\ninterrupted, though, by a<br />\nharsh banging on the toilet<br />\ndoor.<br />\n\"Hey lissen ya cheapskate!<br />\nI saw what ya done, and<br />\nyouse gonna be in a lotta<br />\ntrouble when ya get outta<br />\ndere. Ya understand?\"<br />\nMelvin's heart pounded<br />\nwith fear when he heard the<br />\nangry voice of the attendant.<br />\nAll sorts of possibilities<br />\n<br />\nrushed through his mind:<br />\nescape, suicide,<br />\nvigil,<br />\ndefiance...DEFIANCE? Yes,<br />\nhe, Melvin Gertz, would seize<br />\nthe time, off the pig, smash<br />\nthe state! At last, at long last,<br />\nhe would summon the raw<br />\ncourage needed and break the<br />\nbonds of his fear, yes, yes, he<br />\nwould not obey this time,<br />\ngoddammit, he was sick of<br />\nbeing timid and afraid and<br />\nlaw-abiding, he<br />\nwould<br />\nbecome...A REBEL! He<br />\nglowed with the delicious<br />\npleasure of his new-found<br />\ndaring. His voice caught in<br />\nhis throat and he swallowed<br />\nhard as he readied his<br />\nresponse.<br />\n\"FUCK YOU, WOP!\" he<br />\nscreamed at the top of his<br />\nlungs, the veins bulging in his<br />\nflushed neck.<br />\n<br />\nOutside, the fat Italian's<br />\nface reddened with anger and<br />\ndisbelief, and as he pounded<br />\nat the door with both fists, he<br />\nchoked out a maddened reply.<br />\n\"Why you little punk...\"<br />\nMelvin suddenly felt very<br />\nqueasy, and he was not at all<br />\nsure that he had made the<br />\nright decision. He had been so<br />\nexistential, jut like Camus<br />\nand Mailer would have<br />\nwanted him to be, but he<br />\ndidn't feel much of the<br />\nrebellious exhiliaration that<br />\nhe had often read about.

Friday's report<br />\nunfortunate.<br />\nwas<br />\nMark Spencer<br />\n<br />\nDown Memory Lane Without a Paddle<br />\nMemory can best be described as that function of the brain which<br />\ndeserts you during an exam. Today, therefore, let us take up mnemonics, or little tricks to aid the memory.<br />\nAs you know of course, mnemonics is named. after Mnemon, the<br />\nhero of possibly the loveliest of all the Greek myths. It tells how the<br />\nAthenian youth Mnemon fell in love with the wood nymph Ariadne,<br />\nand she with him. Indeed, so oblivious were these two to everything<br />\nexcept each other, that one year they forgot to attend the festival of<br />\nDemeter, the goddess of bran. Well sir, naturally Demeter got pretty<br />\nwroth, and to make sure the lovers would never forget again, she<br />\nchanged Ariadne into a finger and Mnemon into a piece of string.<br />\nA lovely myth, as you can see, and as you know of course, it's<br />\nbeen the inspiration for dozens of richly romantic books, plays and<br />\noperas, including La Traviato, Dcerslayer and The Joys of Yiddish.<br />\nBut I digress. Mnemonics, I say, are little tricks to aid the memory. For example, here's how I learned my Zip Code-72846. I broke<br />\nit into two smaller groups of digits, each with a special meaning. Like<br />\nthis: 72-846.<br />\nSee how easy it is now? The first group of digits, 72, is, as you<br />\nknow of course, the number of days in the gestation cycle of the larger<br />\nmarsupials, like the oryx, the bushy lemur and the Toyota. And the<br />\nsecond group,846, you will instantly recognize of course as Dick Tracy's<br />\nbadge number.<br />\n<br />\nSTEAKS<br />\n1<br />\nSEAFOOD<br />\nSUBMARINES<br />\nDOUBLE BURGERS<br />\n<br />\nJEN S<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nEAT-1N OR CARRY-OUT<br />\nST.

In fact, say they,<br />\nwe are on the verge of a fantastic new breakthrough. Recent experiments have definitely proved that memory is carried in the brain cells<br />\nby the sub-molecule called RNA. Therefore, say they, as soon as science learns how to synthesize RNA, all we'll have to do is swallow a<br />\nteaspoon of it and\u2014 presto!\u2014 instant memory.<br />\n(Incidentally, if you're wondering what the initials RNA stand<br />\nfor, I forgot. I do recall, however, what DNA stands for. When the<br />\neminent biochemist Alfred J. Sigafoos was isolating DNA back in<br />\n1960, he carried on experiments of such incredible delicacy you can<br />\nscarcely believe it. Why, do you know that he was actually dissecting<br />\ntissues only a trillionth of an inch thick? That's why his fellow lab<br />\nworkers named the stuff DNA\u2014for \"Don't Nudge Alfred.\")<br />\nBut I digress. Some people, I say, believe that science will soon<br />\ndecode RNA.But others are doubtful. How can anybody decode RNA,<br />\nthey ask, when they can't even figure out the brewing formula of<br />\nMiller High Life Beer?<br />\nIt's true, you know. Miller High Life is absolutely unique. No<br />\ncompetitor has ever been able to duplicate it. Oh sure, they've tried.<br />\nIn fact, they've been trying for 115 years. And that's how long they've<br />\nbeen failing because from the very beginning Miller's brewing formula<br />\nhas been a secret known to only one man on earth\u2014Miller's chief<br />\nbrewmaster\u2014 and he never tells it to another soul until, on his deathbed, he whispers it into the ear of his eldest son.<br />\nTake, for example, the current chief brewmaster at Miller High<br />\nLife\u2014Heinrich Lockjaw the XIIth. A veritable tomb is Heinrich the<br />\nXIIth. Believe me, he's been offered plenty to divulge the formula.<br />\nAnd I don't mean just money; I mean treasures far more precious\u2014<br />\nthe Mona Lisa, the Elgin Marbles, Belgium, the only existing skeleton<br />\nof Charlemagne as a boy,the original manuscript of The Joys of Yiddish.<br />\nBut Heinrich the XIIth just keeps shaking his head, determined that<br />\nthe secret of Miller High Life shall be his alone until, with his final<br />\nbreath, he whispers it into the ear of his eldest son Heinrich the XIIIth<br />\n(or Gabby, as all his friends call him).<br />\nBut I digress. You want to know whether science will ever decode<br />\nRNA. Well sir, I don't have the answer.

The,<br />\nNational Collegiate Athletic<br />\nAssociation had voted to<br />\nallow freshmen to participate<br />\nin varsity athletics last June<br />\nbut Hopkins took until<br />\nDecember to concur on the<br />\nruling.<br />\n<br />\nBaby Cagers Maul Drexel<br />\nBy MIKE ANGEL<br />\nThe frosh basketball team,<br />\nfine<br />\nfar' , rallied<br />\nso<br />\nlast Saturday to defeat a fine<br />\nDrexel team, 96-94, in<br />\novertime.<br />\nThe baby Jays in their last<br />\nthree home games have<br />\nshown a very prolific offense<br />\nwhich has averaged 100 plus<br />\npoints a game. The Baby Jays<br />\ncrushed Loyola 107-74, UMBC<br />\n99-55 and Drexel.<br />\nThe victory over Drexel<br />\nwas a very big one for the<br />\nteam, since Drexel had<br />\npreviously won over such<br />\nteams as Villanova. The Jay<br />\nwin can be attributed to<br />\nvarious factors.<br />\nThe game was a teameffort and the distribution of<br />\nscoring shows this. Bob<br />\nFreedman led the scoring<br />\nwith 32 pts., while John<br />\nRutter had 17, John Lusko<br />\ntallied 12 and Tim Knapp had<br />\n10.<br />\nThe frosh throughout the<br />\nnight were deadly from the<br />\nfoul line also hitting 26 of 32<br />\nfor a percentage of 81 per<br />\ncent.<br />\nThroughout the game, the<br />\nscore was close with the lead<br />\nchanging eight times and the<br />\n<br />\ngame being tied on eight<br />\noccasions.<br />\n' Even though every point<br />\nwas important there were<br />\nseveral very big plays during<br />\nthe contest. The first one<br />\noccurred with one second left<br />\nin the first half, when Tim<br />\nKnapp made a three point<br />\nplay to give the frosh a 43-41<br />\n\u2022<br />\nhalf time lead.<br />\nMuch credit should then be<br />\ngiven to Chuck LaBerge, who<br />\nmade several key \"snuffs\" in<br />\nthe overtime period of the<br />\nfinal half.<br />\nThe coaching was also<br />\nsuperb throughout the game,<br />\nas evidenced midway in the<br />\nfourth period, when four<br />\n*starters fouled out, and the<br />\nfrosh were forced to play with<br />\nguards for the remainder of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThere are various factors<br />\nfor the success of the frosh so<br />\nfar this year. The frosh have<br />\nput together the best players<br />\nHopkins has had in years, and<br />\nbecause of this, the team is<br />\nable to stage a highly<br />\ndiversified attack. The team<br />\nplays a tight zone defense and<br />\nhas efficiently utilized the<br />\nfast break on offense.<br />\n<br />\nThe rules of the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference, of which<br />\nHopkins is a member, follow<br />\nthe rules of the NCAA as far<br />\nas eligibility is concerned.<br />\nThe other conference Hopkins<br />\nbelongs to, the Mason-Dixon,<br />\nhas a rule that any school<br />\nover 1200 male enrollment<br />\ncannot use freshmen on their<br />\nvarsity squads. This mean<br />\nthat freshmen can only be<br />\nused in certain situations.<br />\nThe teams that allow<br />\nfreshmen to participate on<br />\ntheir varsity squads will no<br />\nlonger field freshmen teams<br />\nbut will supplant their varsity<br />\nprogram with a junior varsity<br />\nprogram. This will mean that<br />\nsophomores and juniors will<br />\nget more playing time than on<br />\nthe varsity.<br />\nAt its winter Executive<br />\nBoard meeting, the NCAA<br />\nvoted to allow freshmen<br />\nparticipation on varsity football and basketball teams<br />\nfor all schools in the college<br />\ndivision. It would be a good<br />\nidea for Athletic Director<br />\nMarshall Turner to follow suit<br />\nand lift the ban on freshman<br />\nparticipation in these two<br />\nsports.<br />\nIt is a fact that less<br />\nfreshmen will be able to<br />\nparticipate on junior varsity<br />\nteams than on freshman<br />\nteams, yet the change might<br />\nvery well begin to solve the<br />\nproblem of why so many<br />\nupperclassmen drop out of<br />\nthe athletic departments'<br />\nintercollegiate sports.

Hollis, Stephen Tulloss<br />\nPeter Caloger<br />\nAndrew Green<br />\nJay Lenrow<br />\nRussell Lemle<br /><br />\nUndergrad Report<br />\nThe Student Council has finally completed its report<br />\non undergraduate education.<br />\nIts key recommendations are fourfold. First, that all<br />\narea majors be eliminated in favor of a return to the old<br />\ndepartmental system. The switch from department to<br />\narea majors was made three years ago in order to afford<br />\nstudents more flexibility. In that sense, it has done its<br />\njob.<br />\nHowever, since most matters of academic<br />\ngovernance swing on departmental hinges, it has taken<br />\nundergraduates out of a position to participate in<br />\ndecision-making at the most important level--the<br />\ndepartmental. What we suggest is a compromise-simply an option for area or departmental majors.<br />\nThis would enable the student to maintain maximum<br />\nflexibility while, at the same time, by including a<br />\nprovision to let an area major declare a departmental<br />\naffiliation, allow him the chance to be included in<br />\ndepartmental governance.<br />\nsupport<br />\nthe<br />\nsecond<br />\nWe<br />\nwholeheartedly<br />\nrecommendation of the SC committee. It urges that<br />\nteaching capabilities be weighted equally with<br />\npublishing and research in faculty hiring and promotion<br />\nconsiderations. Such a balance is the only way to insure<br />\nundergraduates a fair shake.<br />\nThe committee's report thirdly calls for the<br />\nimplementation of a one-man one-course requirement,<br />\nwhereby, except in special cases, each department<br />\nwould have to offer a minimum of one course to<br />\nundergraduates for each of its professors. This<br />\narrangement, as we have said before, is certainly<br />\njustifiable and has a strong base in University<br />\ntraditions.<br />\nFourthly, the committee urges that one-third of the<br />\nfaculty be required to offer seminars open to all each<br />\nsemester and that these seminars be limited to fifteen<br />\nstudents. The incongruity of the numbers game aside,<br />\nthe area of seminar education is probably the most<br />\noverbilled and underplayed at Hopkins. Although we<br />\nare not certain that an absolute one-third guideline<br />\nwould be desirable, we are certain that almost anything<br />\nwould be an improvement.<br /><br />\nMinority Hiring<br />\nThe latest victims of the University's financial crisis<br />\nare black and women employees. There has been a<br />\ndrastic hiring slow-down, and more jobs seem likely to<br />\nbe cut as a result of the fiscal woes that have hit all<br />\nUniversity divisions. The low minority percentages in<br />\nmost job categories have not changed since last year.<br />\nAnd one of the more glaring flaws in University policy-the incredible lack of black faculty--has even worsened.<br />\nLast year, there were 19 token black faculty out of 1,285<br />\nin all of the Baltimore divisions; this year there are only<br />\n8-- and none of them are at Homewood. Dean Benton's<br />\nprotestations of good intent notwithstanding, the<br />\nUniversity is failing miserably in filling this important<br />\nneed.<br />\nissuing<br />\nwill<br />\nbe<br />\nOffice<br />\nThe<br />\nPersonnel<br />\nrecommendations to Gordon,soon on how to best end<br />\nUniversity discrimination.

Those of us<br />\nwho did not sign suffered the<br />\nusual fate of minorities of not<br />\nhaving<br />\nmuch<br />\nof<br />\nan<br />\nopportunity to present the<br />\nreasons for our actions.<br />\nIndeed, I am not sure whether<br />\nwe share reasons in common.<br />\nThe petition and the<br />\ncommittee report which<br />\nprovoked it seem to me to be<br />\na good example of hasty<br />\ncasting about to find a set of<br />\nvillains on which to fix the<br />\nblame for the present crisis of<br />\nthe University. University<br />\nadministrations are rarely<br />\nheroes to faculty and students<br />\nin the best of times and in<br />\nthese poor to bad times they<br />\nare the most vulnerable<br />\ncandidates for victimization.<br />\nI am not sure that Hopkins<br />\nspends more or less than it<br />\nshould for its administration: The Faculty committee<br />\nreport is too superficial an<br />\nanalysis to allow such judgments to be made. I do know<br />\nthat compared to other major<br />\nschools, Hopkins spends<br />\nproportionately less on its<br />\nadministration.<br />\nIn any event, it is not the<br />\nproportion<br />\nwhich<br />\nis<br />\nimportant, it is the quality of<br />\nessential services that is<br />\ncritical. An across-the-board<br />\ncut in administrative costs<br /><br />\nmay<br />\nnot<br />\nimprove<br />\nadministrative services:<br />\nIndeed it may actually lower<br />\nquality<br />\nand<br />\npresent<br />\ndifficulties in improving the<br />\nUniversity's position.<br />\nBefore doing anything<br />\nhasty, I would like to see a<br />\nthorough analysis of the<br />\nUniversity and its various<br />\nparts, including academic<br />\ndepartments. It can only be<br />\non the basis of understanding<br />\nhow well each of the<br />\ncomponents of the University<br />\nis functioning that you can<br />\nmake rational decisions<br />\nabout where expenditures<br />\ncan be cut without crippling<br /><br />\nthe ability of Hopkins to serve<br />\nits major goals.<br />\nPeter H.

Instead of<br />\nconcentrating on reducing<br />\nclass size, increasing course<br />\nofferings, and making the<br />\nfaculty bigshots teach more<br />\nthan a token course, the SC,<br />\nwith the ready help of the<br />\nadministration, is ready to<br />\nplan for a student union in a<br />\nbuilding discarded by the<br />\nadministration.<br />\nNothing like throwing<br />\nadministration scraps to the<br />\ndogs, especially<br />\nwhen<br />\nGordon's Gang has a new<br />\nPentagon that should have<br />\nbeen built for classrooms.<br />\nBut there are other reasons<br />\nwhy I think the student union<br />\nin Whitehead is a waste of<br />\neffort.<br />\n1. At a time when the last<br />\nfaculty hired might be the<br />\nfirst fired, (remember,<br />\nthey're the young ones who do<br />\nmost of the teaching), it<br />\nseems<br />\nand<br />\nridiculous<br />\nredundant to spend limited<br />\nmoney for a union that would<br />\nmerely duplicate present<br />\nfacilities....<br />\nJim Cleary is a senior.<br /><br />\n2. Not only would the<br />\nstudent union be redundant, it<br />\nwould also be rarely used.<br />\nHow many students want to<br />\nmake this campus a place<br />\nwhere they come to when<br />\nthey have nothing to do.<br />\nProbably very few. And since<br />\nan increasing number of<br />\nstudents live beyond walking<br />\ndistance to the campus, how<br />\nmany undergrads are going<br />\nto want to hop into the car for<br />\nan evening of relaxation at<br />\nthe very place that they<br />\nmoved far from to avoid.<br />\nNo Relaxation<br />\nDuring my four years here,<br />\nit seems to me that most<br />\nHopkins students want to get<br />\noff campus as soon as classes<br />\nare over and spend their free<br />\ntime in a place where they<br />\nare not continually shat upon<br />\nby faculty and administration. I really don't see how<br />\nwe could relax in a building<br />\nunder Massa Linc's authority<br />\nand which is guarded by Weinbach's Pinkertons.<br />\n3.

And<br />\nwe all know that the faculty<br />\nmembers who have power<br />\nbelieve and kill (RIP<br />\nEducation and Russian) for<br />\nthe idea that research comes<br />\nfirst and second and third<br />\nand...<br />\n4.<br />\nDespite<br />\nall<br />\nmy<br />\ncomplaining, though, we do<br />\nhave it plush here, compared<br />\nto the rest of Baltimore and to<br />\nwhat the Hopkins janitors<br />\nhave to live on. Would any one<br />\nof my readers want their<br />\nfathers to be paid what we,<br />\nthe administration, faculty,<br />\nand students, pay the<br />\njanitors?<br />\nThe student union seems to<br />\nbe an easy solution to the<br />\nundergraduate problem here,<br />\nbut I doubt if it will solve<br />\nanything.

It was one of those<br />\nimperial-sized men's rooms,<br />\nwith rows upon rows of<br />\nurinals, all of them occupied<br />\nby nervious men pissing with<br />\ntheir eyes closed, praying<br />\nthat they wouldn't be<br />\nmistaken for a faggot. And<br />\nway off in the distance, there<br />\nwere the pay toilets.<br />\nAs always, there was one<br />\n(1) free toilet, craftily<br />\ndesigned to be so disgusting<br />\n'is to leave you no choice but<br />\nto pay your 254;t, unless you<br />\nwished to feel like a worthless<br />\npenny-pincher. Melvin,<br />\nunfortunately, had no change,<br />\nbut this particular free toilet<br />\nwas, by most estimates, the<br /><br />\nmost revolting free toilet on<br />\nthe East Coast.<br />\nConsider what that meant!<br />\nFor all the thousands upon<br />\nthousands of shoddy restrooms that assault the<br />\ntraveller in gas stations and<br />\nrestaurants<br />\nand<br />\nbus<br />\nterminals, this free toilet was<br />\nthe unrivalled champion of<br />\nthem all. From miles around,<br />\ntourists would come to gaze<br />\nwith unbelieving eyes at the<br />\nmarvel, and there was much<br />\ntalk of preserving it as a<br />\nNational Shrine. The horror<br />\nof this phenomenom is<br />\nimpossible to describe, but<br />\nimagine, if you dare, the<br />\nstench, the mangled fixtures,<br />\nthe perverted inscriptions<br />\nthat defiled its walls.<br />\nBy this time, Melvin was in<br />\na cold sweat. The vast men's<br />\nroom was carefully guarded<br />\nby one aging, fat Italian who<br />\nsquatted on a stool, in front of<br />\na row of towels, combs, and<br />\nhair tonics. The man<br />\nwandered away briefly.<br />\nAs soon as Melvin felt the<br />\ncoast was clear, he made a<br />\nquick dash down the row of<br />\npay toilets, looking under the<br />\ndoors for one that was vacant.<br />\nMelvin's razor-sharp mind<br />\nsoon grasped that most were<br />\noccupied, and he ran<br />\nfrantically up and down the<br />\naisle, all the while fancying<br />\nhimself as Gary Cooper on a<br />\ndangerous combat mission.<br /><br />\nEver-vigilent police on the prowlfor the nefarious desperado, Melvin Gertz.<br />\nAt last, he spied one that<br />\nwas vacant, hit the ground<br />\nlike a veteran soldier, and<br />\ncrawled on<br />\nhis<br />\nbelly<br />\nunderneath the locked door to<br />\nthe sweet sanctuary of the<br />\ntoilet bowl. And just in the<br />\nnick of time, too.<br />\nA smile of total bliss<br />\ncrossed our hero's face as he<br />\nunburdened himself. His<br />\nrevery<br />\nwas<br />\nrudely<br />\ninterrupted, though, by a<br />\nharsh banging on the toilet<br />\ndoor.<br />\n\"Hey lissen ya cheapskate!<br />\nI saw what ya done, and<br />\nyouse gonna be in a lotta<br />\ntrouble when ya get outta<br />\ndere. Ya understand?\"<br />\nMelvin's heart pounded<br />\nwith fear when he heard the<br />\nangry voice of the attendant.<br />\nAll sorts of possibilities<br /><br />\nrushed through his mind:<br />\nescape, suicide,<br />\nvigil,<br />\ndefiance...DEFIANCE? Yes,<br />\nhe, Melvin Gertz, would seize<br />\nthe time, off the pig, smash<br />\nthe state! At last, at long last,<br />\nhe would summon the raw<br />\ncourage needed and break the<br />\nbonds of his fear, yes, yes, he<br />\nwould not obey this time,<br />\ngoddammit, he was sick of<br />\nbeing timid and afraid and<br />\nlaw-abiding, he<br />\nwould<br />\nbecome...A REBEL! He<br />\nglowed with the delicious<br />\npleasure of his new-found<br />\ndaring. His voice caught in<br />\nhis throat and he swallowed<br />\nhard as he readied his<br />\nresponse.<br />\n\"FUCK YOU, WOP!\" he<br />\nscreamed at the top of his<br />\nlungs, the veins bulging in his<br />\nflushed neck.<br /><br />\nOutside, the fat Italian's<br />\nface reddened with anger and<br />\ndisbelief, and as he pounded<br />\nat the door with both fists, he<br />\nchoked out a maddened reply.<br />\n\"Why you little punk...\"<br />\nMelvin suddenly felt very<br />\nqueasy, and he was not at all<br />\nsure that he had made the<br />\nright decision.

Today, therefore, let us take up mnemonics, or little tricks to aid the memory.<br />\nAs you know of course, mnemonics is named. after Mnemon, the<br />\nhero of possibly the loveliest of all the Greek myths. It tells how the<br />\nAthenian youth Mnemon fell in love with the wood nymph Ariadne,<br />\nand she with him. Indeed, so oblivious were these two to everything<br />\nexcept each other, that one year they forgot to attend the festival of<br />\nDemeter, the goddess of bran. Well sir, naturally Demeter got pretty<br />\nwroth, and to make sure the lovers would never forget again, she<br />\nchanged Ariadne into a finger and Mnemon into a piece of string.<br />\nA lovely myth, as you can see, and as you know of course, it's<br />\nbeen the inspiration for dozens of richly romantic books, plays and<br />\noperas, including La Traviato, Dcerslayer and The Joys of Yiddish.<br />\nBut I digress. Mnemonics, I say, are little tricks to aid the memory. For example, here's how I learned my Zip Code-72846. I broke<br />\nit into two smaller groups of digits, each with a special meaning. Like<br />\nthis: 72-846.<br />\nSee how easy it is now? The first group of digits, 72, is, as you<br />\nknow of course, the number of days in the gestation cycle of the larger<br />\nmarsupials, like the oryx, the bushy lemur and the Toyota. And the<br />\nsecond group,846, you will instantly recognize of course as Dick Tracy's<br />\nbadge number.<br /><br />\nSTEAKS<br />\n1<br />\nSEAFOOD<br />\nSUBMARINES<br />\nDOUBLE BURGERS<br /><br />\nJEN S<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nEAT-1N OR CARRY-OUT<br />\nST.

In fact, say they,<br />\nwe are on the verge of a fantastic new breakthrough. Recent experiments have definitely proved that memory is carried in the brain cells<br />\nby the sub-molecule called RNA. Therefore, say they, as soon as science learns how to synthesize RNA, all we'll have to do is swallow a<br />\nteaspoon of it and\u2014 presto!\u2014 instant memory.<br />\n(Incidentally, if you're wondering what the initials RNA stand<br />\nfor, I forgot. I do recall, however, what DNA stands for. When the<br />\neminent biochemist Alfred J.

That's why his fellow lab<br />\nworkers named the stuff DNA\u2014for \"Don't Nudge Alfred.\")<br />\nBut I digress. Some people, I say, believe that science will soon<br />\ndecode RNA.But others are doubtful. How can anybody decode RNA,<br />\nthey ask, when they can't even figure out the brewing formula of<br />\nMiller High Life Beer?<br />\nIt's true, you know. Miller High Life is absolutely unique. No<br />\ncompetitor has ever been able to duplicate it. Oh sure, they've tried.<br />\nIn fact, they've been trying for 115 years. And that's how long they've<br />\nbeen failing because from the very beginning Miller's brewing formula<br />\nhas been a secret known to only one man on earth\u2014Miller's chief<br />\nbrewmaster\u2014 and he never tells it to another soul until, on his deathbed, he whispers it into the ear of his eldest son.<br />\nTake, for example, the current chief brewmaster at Miller High<br />\nLife\u2014Heinrich Lockjaw the XIIth. A veritable tomb is Heinrich the<br />\nXIIth.

The first one<br />\noccurred with one second left<br />\nin the first half, when Tim<br />\nKnapp made a three point<br />\nplay to give the frosh a 43-41<br />\n\u2022<br />\nhalf time lead.<br />\nMuch credit should then be<br />\ngiven to Chuck LaBerge, who<br />\nmade several key \"snuffs\" in<br />\nthe overtime period of the<br />\nfinal half.<br />\nThe coaching was also<br />\nsuperb throughout the game,<br />\nas evidenced midway in the<br />\nfourth period, when four<br />\n*starters fouled out, and the<br />\nfrosh were forced to play with<br />\nguards for the remainder of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThere are various factors<br />\nfor the success of the frosh so<br />\nfar this year. The frosh have<br />\nput together the best players<br />\nHopkins has had in years, and<br />\nbecause of this, the team is<br />\nable to stage a highly<br />\ndiversified attack.

This mean<br />\nthat freshmen can only be<br />\nused in certain situations.<br />\nThe teams that allow<br />\nfreshmen to participate on<br />\ntheir varsity squads will no<br />\nlonger field freshmen teams<br />\nbut will supplant their varsity<br />\nprogram with a junior varsity<br />\nprogram. This will mean that<br />\nsophomores and juniors will<br />\nget more playing time than on<br />\nthe varsity.<br />\nAt its winter Executive<br />\nBoard meeting, the NCAA<br />\nvoted to allow freshmen<br />\nparticipation on varsity football and basketball teams<br />\nfor all schools in the college<br />\ndivision. It would be a good<br />\nidea for Athletic Director<br />\nMarshall Turner to follow suit<br />\nand lift the ban on freshman<br />\nparticipation in these two<br />\nsports.<br />\nIt is a fact that less<br />\nfreshmen will be able to<br />\nparticipate on junior varsity<br />\nteams than on freshman<br />\nteams, yet the change might<br />\nvery well begin to solve the<br />\nproblem of why so many<br />\nupperclassmen drop out of<br />\nthe athletic departments'<br />\nintercollegiate sports.
