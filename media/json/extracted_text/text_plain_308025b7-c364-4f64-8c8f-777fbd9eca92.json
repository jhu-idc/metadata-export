On his working<br />\nrelationship with President<br />\n<br />\nMuller: \"I think we have an<br />\nunspoken understanding about<br />\nhow we'll work; you could use<br />\nthe word simpatico or the French<br />\nidea of sympathique to describe<br />\nthe relationship.\"<br />\nAnd elaborations usually<br />\nfollow his basic statements: \"I<br />\nthink the new definition of the<br />\nProvost as the President's alter<br />\n<br />\nAC studying BRP report<br />\nBy RICHARD BLAND<br />\nFour members of an Academic<br />\nCouncil sub -committee are<br />\nstudying the final BRP report on<br />\nundergraduate education and<br />\nhope to make recommendations<br />\nto the Council on May 5.<br />\nDean George Owen, an AC<br />\nmember, estimated that all _ _ the<br />\nfinal BRP report recommendations would eventually be<br />\nimplemented as best they could.<br />\n\"There is nothing on the<br />\nreport that is hard to do, or<br />\ndistasteful,\" Owen commented.<br />\nHe added, though, that<br />\n\"implementing parts of it may be<br />\ntricky.\"<br />\n<br />\npresent system, to give every<br />\nundergraduate access to a faculty<br />\nadvisor from the beginning of his<br />\nfreshman year.

'\"Research,<br />\nteaching capabilities, letters of<br />\nrecommendation and the outside<br />\nevaluations are probably the<br />\nmost important factors<br />\ndetermining promotion,\" said<br />\nChrist.<br />\n<br />\nego means the President can tell<br />\nme what he thinks about<br />\nsomething and then ask me what<br />\nI think. It means the Provost will<br />\nhave the frankness and openness<br />\nand willingness to be in<br />\ndisagreement without fear.\"<br />\nWoolf has no intention of<br />\ncompletely abandoning Gilman<br />\nHall. Without any hesitation he<br />\nlabels his department as the<br />\nfinest History of Science unit in<br />\nthe country. \"I'm still going to<br />\nbe very concerned about my<br />\ndepartment; and next year there<br />\nmay be some additions, which<br />\nI'm very excited about, and a<br />\nlittle bit of growth.

Yes..., that's<br />\nit\u2014contrasts. A writer, if you didn't<br />\nknow.<br />\nDark brown hair down to his collar, a<br />\nplain black suit most likely off a rack<br />\nrather than tailored, a button-down white<br />\nshirt, and an equally unstylish thin, dark<br />\ntie. Brown, black, white, black, and also<br />\nblack shoes. Dark, dark, light, dark, dark.<br />\nLast Wednesday the Barnstormers<br />\nperformed two of his plays, Love Scene<br />\nand A Theological Proposition. He had<br />\nnot ever seen either of them performed,<br />\nso at the very least some of his curiosity<br />\nwas satisfied. I didn't see the<br />\nperformance, but I was told that it was<br />\n\"uhh, OK.\"<br />\nFor me, Coover didn't exist except<br />\nabstractly on the printed page until<br />\nThursday night. Schaffer 3 was scheduled<br />\nto become the setting for the<br />\npresentation of a work of art, as opposed<br />\nto a lecture. For a mere dollar (said the<br />\nman at the carnival) you can see Robert<br />\nCoover's (Yes!) film on the student<br />\nprotests of 1968 at Iowa State.<br />\nThe audience could have been divided<br />\nrrric<br />\n<br />\nOcs.c.<br />\n<br />\nnumber of people who were familiar with<br />\nCoover's novels or short stories, and a<br />\nplurality who had nothing else to do for<br />\nthe night.<br />\nMaybe it wasn't really significant what<br />\ncategory you were in, because almost no<br />\none noticed Coover walking down to the<br />\nfront of the room to take a seat,just like<br />\na..., an ordinary person.<br />\nFrankly, I expected someone who<br />\nwrote plays which required their actors<br />\nto inquire,\"My God, are you still kissing<br />\neach other? JUMP HER FOR<br />\nCHRISSAKE!\" to be, ah, different<br />\nlooking. Wild hair, flashy clothes, a<br />\nswaggering walk, a weird lady friend.<br />\nInstead, Coover looked almost<br />\ndistinguished, and his wife was simply<br />\ncharming. Contrasts to expectations, you<br />\nsee.<br />\nHis own film was preceeded by two<br />\nothers: Film by Samuel Beckett and one<br />\nby Brackage whose title I don't<br />\nremember. The less said about that part<br />\nof the evening the better, because the<br />\naudience insisted on laughing at strange<br />\nmoments during Film and yawning<br />\nduring the other flick..

Basically Coover<br />\nshowed a home movie, but at a dollar a<br />\nhead. The film chronicled the events<br />\n(violence) at Iowa State with the help of<br />\na sound track containing informal<br />\ninterviews with the people involved. The<br />\ninterviews were conducted a year after<br />\nthe events, so you watched anonymous<br />\npeople being threatened and sometimes<br />\nclubbed and dragged out of buildings<br />\nwhile equally anonymous voices calmly<br />\ntalked about it. Rather chilling. Some<br />\nparts of the film did have synchronized<br />\nsound. Sirens, screams, people singing,<br />\npeople arguing, speeches, sirens, sirens. It<br />\nwas very good from the standpoint of<br />\nnostalgia, which twenty year olds seem to<br />\ncrave intensely. People began to talk<br />\nabout \"the good old days\" at Homewood<br />\nHouse and what they did and what you<br />\ndid during that wonderful, wonderful<br />\nperiod of our lives.<br />\nCoover quietly explained that some of<br />\nthe most violent footage disappeared<br />\nsomewhere between the developing lab<br />\nand, to make a guess, the police. He said<br />\nhe usually received polite smiles when he<br />\ntried to track down the missing film<br />\npackets, but the implication was that<br />\nNarAc9..,ss rcw,i'te wa.s.<br />\n<br />\necw.3.0-1tcs<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nachcalpolitics at Hopkins:hope?<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nFor ages, after man had learned to<br />\nplow the land, men lived on hope in the<br />\nspring, when the air grows warm and ice<br />\ncracks on the rivers. Winter was a killer,<br />\nraking away the old and the infirm and<br />\nthe very young. Only in famine years did<br />\nstarvation take its toll. Men had enough<br />\nfood until the thawing of the ground and<br />\nthe plowing. In spring, however, the dying did not stop. Foodstores were depleted: the grain was often gone, there<br />\nwas no meat and little fish or game, berries had not yet appeared. Men would die<br />\nof starvation on the land they plowed.<br />\nThey lived on hope; while they lived,<br />\nthey found a way to get on with their<br />\nlives.<br />\nIn America, most of us don't worry<br />\nabout there being enough food to last<br />\nuntil the first harvests. We try to get on<br />\nwith our lives as best we can. The past<br />\nfew springs have been anomalies, times<br />\nwe did not get on with our lives, but tried<br />\nto express what we thought were their<br />\nmeanings.<br />\nIt hasn't been easy for me to take<br />\nto the streets. I had grown up with the<br />\nethic of a quieter time, believing that<br />\nonly great men would speak out against<br />\nthe stupidity of tyranny and self-serving<br />\nlies. I have grown up, though, over the<br />\npast four years following President<br />\nLyndon Johnson's announcement that<br />\nNorth Vietnam would no longer be<br />\nbombed, and that the war would soon<br />\nend. What happened in the streets of<br />\nChicago, and in Washington twice. and<br />\n<br />\nback in April of 1968 throughout the<br />\nnation's cities, has happened to all of<br />\nAmerica, and continues to go on in Vietnam and throughout the world.<br />\nNot only have we learned that Americs's is a brutal, self-serving, and declining'<br />\nculture, but we have also learned that<br />\nthere is little that we can do to change<br />\nthe situation. America has become a sort<br />\nof Newtonian world-clock-machine gone<br />\nawry, which produced on impulse the<br />\nacts and litanies of the past.<br />\nThe war in Indochina has grown up<br />\nwith us, and continues incomprehensible,<br />\nlike cancer. There seems little that can be<br />\ndone now, except to wait until the elections, which presumably will give America another chance. Two years ago, it<br />\nseems, a lot of people thought the war<br />\nwas almost over. Most of us who did not<br />\nwere called fools or worse; the sad fact is<br />\nthat in recent years, everyone who has<br />\nsincorely tried to stop the war has been<br />\ncalled a traitor. A Nixon aide recently<br />\naccused war protersers of consciously<br />\n\"aiding and abetting the enemy.\" We<br />\nhaven't heard talk like that since the heyday of General Westmoreland.<br />\n<br />\ntook a day off for politics.<br />\nSome might point to the strike two<br />\nyears ago to show the depth of student<br />\ninvolvement, but, let's face it, if there<br />\nhadn't been a Lincoln Gordon, and if<br />\nthere hadn't been tropical weather, then<br />\nthere probably wouldn't even have been a<br />\nstrike. For the average Hoppie, radical<br />\npolitics is something to be left to the<br />\nVillage Voice and Time magazine.<br />\nThe reason there have been little more<br />\nthan faint stirrings of anti-war action at<br />\nHopkins is that here, as throughout the<br />\nnation, people just want to get on with<br />\ntheir lives. Whether th,lit is possible these<br />\ndays remains an open question.<br />\n<br />\nPolitics at Hopkins<br />\nAll this brings us to the question of<br />\nwhy there's so little along the lines of war<br />\nprotest going on at Hopkins. The Hop has<br />\nalways been virtually dead. This must be<br />\nthe only school in America east of Oral<br />\nRoberts to feature the Army paratroopers at its spring festival. Half the<br />\nstudents here think they could never get<br />\ninto med school or law school if they<br />\n<br />\nSo he said he wanted a cone of French Vanilla, huh?<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\n\"Well, the other day this kid came in<br />\nhere and said he wanted a cone of French<br />\nVanilla.

So he tasted it, and liked it so<br />\nmuch he bought a triple cone.\"<br />\nSal Barone, the owner of the new<br />\nPeterson's ice-cream and candy store in<br />\nthe Rotunda, doesn't know much about<br />\nice-cream.

As with any such major<br />\nproposal, battle lines have been firmly<br />\ndrawn between proponents and<br />\nopponents high in the local power<br />\nstructures, and very little useful<br />\ncommentary has drifted down to the<br />\npotential beneficiaries or victims. As a<br />\nHopkins Medical School senior, former<br />\nHomewood undergraduate and 2-5<br />\nprogram participant, and erstwhile<br />\nresearcher in the Homewood Biophysics<br />\nDepartment, I would like to make a few<br />\nthoroughly jaundiced observations.<br />\nThe scheme, to be unfairly brief, is to<br />\ncreate a \"preclinical\" medical school<br />\nbased at Homewood in which students<br />\nentering directly from high school would<br />\ntake a continuously integrated<br />\ncurriculum (2-2-2) of liberal arts, medical<br />\nsciences and clinical medicine (at East<br />\nBaltimore) leading to a MD in six years.<br />\nThe few medical students asked about<br />\nthis idea have been reasonably sanguine,<br />\nstemming, one suspects, from the<br />\n<br />\nignore the sentiment of the people and continues the<br />\nwar in Vietnam, that fall may come sooner than<br />\nanyone had expected.<br />\nThis has been a long war. For seven years the protest<br />\nagainst the war has been going on. For seven years the<br />\ngovernment has ignored the sentiment of Americans<br />\nwho oppose the war, the bombing, and the domestic<br />\nproblems that the war has caused. For seven years, in<br />\nspite of endless protests and demands for change, the<br />\nAmerican government has pursued the same policy in<br />\nIndochina. Americans are plainly sick and tired of the<br />\nwar, but the government refuses to stop. For seven<br />\nsprings people have demonstrated against the war while<br />\nit has gone on and on, with more and more bombing<br />\nand more and more destruction and more and more<br />\ndeath. The regime that this war seeks to protect has<br />\nlong ago been discredited.<br />\n<br />\nuntil that company decided to close its<br />\nplant here.<br />\n\"They offered to transfer me to a little<br />\ntown in Indiana, North Liberty, I think\".<br />\nBarone really didn't want to go to North<br />\nLiberty, so he looked around; \"Being 43<br />\nyears old and of sound mind, I thought<br />\nthere was something else I could do.\" He<br />\nsaw an ad for a Peterson Ice Cream franchise in the Sun, and he checked out the<br />\nplace. When he saw the location, he<br />\nbecame enthusiastic and decided to go<br />\ninto the ice-cream business.<br />\nThe Rotunda is the only shopping mall<br />\nin an area of about 60,000 people, and<br />\nBarone gets a mixture of business ranging<br />\nfrom the next-door insurance company<br />\nlunch crowd to late night(until 10) Hopkins students' munchies. The mall is<br />\nrapidly filling up with stores, and the<br />\nHecht Co. is reportedly negotiating for a<br />\n<br />\nlease in the building. Barone got in on the<br />\nground floor, with a five-year lease and<br />\nan equally long option.<br />\nBarone uses about 100 gallons of<br />\nDolley Madison ice-cream every week,<br />\nbut he expects that to pick up with the<br />\nadvent of hot weather. His store also sells<br />\nfudge and chocolates, and the only help<br />\nhe has now include his son, daughter, and<br />\nher best friend, all teen-agers. He works<br />\nhard about twelve hours a day, and he is<br />\ndrawing a salary, though it is less than he<br />\nwas making as a metallurgist. Barone<br />\nseems to like being his own boss, and<br />\nwhen he is faced with the classic 'plop' of<br />\na newly-bought ice-cream cone on the<br />\ncarpet outside, he seems happy to give<br />\nthe poor kid a new cone. Like he says,<br />\n\"only happy people go out for icecream\", and he doesn't want to disappoint anyone.<br />\n<br />\nmeetings, he could forget about<br />\ncooperation in recovering his lost property<br />\nThe rumor was that the state police were<br />\nusing his un-returned film to \"prove\"<br />\nthat there had been a student riot.<br />\nComprehensive Account<br />\nCoover and three or four Iowa<br />\nstudents had informally worked together<br />\nduring the protest in order to come up<br />\nwith enough footage to make one<br />\ncomprehensive account of the events. It's<br />\nreasonable to wonder whether any<br />\nNews-Letter reader with some friends,<br />\naccess to 16mm equipment, and money<br />\nfor film couldn't have made an equally<br />\ninteresting production. But could you<br />\ncharge admission for people to see it?<br />\nDefinitely better than grad school.<br />\nRepresentatives from all three<br />\nsubdivisions of the audience were at a<br />\nreception for Coover after the films, and<br />\nCoover looked as if he had gone through<br />\nit all many times before. People patiently<br />\nstood in line to have an audience with<br />\nhim, and he would patiently listen and<br />\nreply to stupid or brilliant comments<br />\nabout the movie or his books or himself.<br />\nI had decided that he must do his<br />\nwriting by isolating himself in a plush<br />\nhome library and then painstakingly<br />\nsearch his mind for the perfect word for<br />\nThere should be no incongruities in the<br />\n<br />\nscheme, no contrasts. The earth is a<br />\nperfect circle and all the planets revolve<br />\naround something else in perfect circles.<br />\nUnfortunately, we're on a giant egg<br />\nwhich moves around in an elliptical path.<br />\nAnd Coover, although outwardly looking<br />\nthe same, became on Friday the man<br />\nimplied by his stories as he read \"Cat in<br />\nthe Hat,\" inspired by our childhood<br />\ncompanion, Dr. Seuss. He said he wrote it<br />\nin a hotel room, not a library.<br />\nNow, if you're still restricted to<br />\nreading pre-Robert Coover fiction, let me<br />\njust say that Coover's stories occasionally<br />\nedge close to the line which separates art<br />\nfrom pornography, as one of his editors<br />\nrecently put it. That type of story does<br />\nnot imply, for me, a creator with a fine<br />\nspeaking voice, a smile for the individuals<br />\nhe recognized from the night before, and<br />\nwith glasses for reading his manuscript.<br />\nHe read the story with a degree of<br />\nenthusiasm that would outrage the type<br />\nof person which we usually visualize<br />\nwhen we think of people who wear black<br />\nsuits and black shoes. Contrasts, my<br />\nfriends.<br />\nThe story: The Cat in the Hat was<br />\nrunning for President against the<br />\nincumbent who was \"taciturn but<br />\negregrious\u2014in short, a natural.\" One of<br />\nthe slogans of the Cat's bizzare campaign<br />\nwas \"Mee-yew,\" but the Garrett Room<br />\naudience really went for the special<br />\nbathroom slogan, \"What this nation<br />\nneeds is more pussy.\" Good 'ol male<br />\nhumor.<br />\nConvention Slogan<br />\nThe convention slogan was, \"Have no<br />\nfear of this mess.\" The Hopkins audience<br />\ndidn't stop laughing even when Coover's<br />\ncharacters pointed out that \"the cat's<br />\nantics expose the madness of normalcy.\"<br />\n\"It's enough to say that the Cat didn't<br />\nget elected bacause of some gruesome<br />\npre-election day complications. The<br />\ncomplications were actually only<br />\nenlargements of what we label<br />\n\"normalcy.\"<br />\nBut what about Robert Coover\u2014who is<br />\nRobert Coover? There are several<br />\npossibilities: An unexceptional film<br />\nmaker, the person who writes what one<br />\nprofessor called \"the thickest stories I've<br />\nread by a modern author,\" a somewhat<br />\ndapper man who is concerned with the<br />\nquality of life, or a man who can cause<br />\nhis readers to laugh hysterically because<br />\nof the outrageousness of what he writes<br />\n(thinks?).<br />\nHe was introduced as \"one of the most<br />\ninnovative men in American letters,\" and<br />\nthat's about what you would expect from<br />\na man so full of harmonious

Dr.<br />\nHarry Woolf will be moving from<br />\nthe Chairmanship of the History<br />\nof Science department to the<br />\noffice of the Provost with<br />\nenthusiasm.<br />\n\"You realize, of course, that<br />\nthe Provostship President Muller<br />\nhas talked about is a wholly new<br />\nconcept.\" And Woolf already<br />\nknows enough about it to sketch<br />\nthe outlines of the office: \"The<br />\nProvost is going to be an<br />\nindividual responsible for<br />\nknowing about student life,<br />\nresearch life, and education.<br />\nHopefully, it's going to be the<br /><br />\nplace where some sense of the<br />\nUniversity as a whole gets housed.<br />\nWoolf has studied and taught<br />\nin several countries and he<br />\nsometimes translates his thoughts<br />\ninto verbal expressions which<br />\nlose much of their meaning if<br />\nthey're forced into Anglo-Saxon<br />\nthought units. On his working<br />\nrelationship with President<br /><br />\nMuller: \"I think we have an<br />\nunspoken understanding about<br />\nhow we'll work; you could use<br />\nthe word simpatico or the French<br />\nidea of sympathique to describe<br />\nthe relationship.\"<br />\nAnd elaborations usually<br />\nfollow his basic statements: \"I<br />\nthink the new definition of the<br />\nProvost as the President's alter<br /><br />\nAC studying BRP report<br />\nBy RICHARD BLAND<br />\nFour members of an Academic<br />\nCouncil sub -committee are<br />\nstudying the final BRP report on<br />\nundergraduate education and<br />\nhope to make recommendations<br />\nto the Council on May 5.<br />\nDean George Owen, an AC<br />\nmember, estimated that all _ _ the<br />\nfinal BRP report recommendations would eventually be<br />\nimplemented as best they could.<br />\n\"There is nothing on the<br />\nreport that is hard to do, or<br />\ndistasteful,\" Owen commented.<br />\nHe added, though, that<br />\n\"implementing parts of it may be<br />\ntricky.\"<br /><br />\npresent system, to give every<br />\nundergraduate access to a faculty<br />\nadvisor from the beginning of his<br />\nfreshman year.

'\"Research,<br />\nteaching capabilities, letters of<br />\nrecommendation and the outside<br />\nevaluations are probably the<br />\nmost important factors<br />\ndetermining promotion,\" said<br />\nChrist.<br /><br />\nego means the President can tell<br />\nme what he thinks about<br />\nsomething and then ask me what<br />\nI think. It means the Provost will<br />\nhave the frankness and openness<br />\nand willingness to be in<br />\ndisagreement without fear.\"<br />\nWoolf has no intention of<br />\ncompletely abandoning Gilman<br />\nHall. Without any hesitation he<br />\nlabels his department as the<br />\nfinest History of Science unit in<br />\nthe country. \"I'm still going to<br />\nbe very concerned about my<br />\ndepartment; and next year there<br />\nmay be some additions, which<br />\nI'm very excited about, and a<br />\nlittle bit of growth. The<br />\ndiscipline is moving closer to the<br />\ncore of education.<br />\n\"I intend to teach, but not<br />\nnext year.

He expressed some<br />\noptimism for a reversal in<br />\nadministrative policy.<br />\nAngered Faculty<br />\nBenton said that the faculty<br />\nhas been angered by students<br />\ndropping courses late in the<br />\nsemester if they are not satisfied<br />\nwith their grades in the course.<br />\nIle stated, \"We need a definite<br />\ntime line beyond which students<br />\ncannot drop courses with<br />\nimpunity.

Dark, dark, light, dark, dark.<br />\nLast Wednesday the Barnstormers<br />\nperformed two of his plays, Love Scene<br />\nand A Theological Proposition.

Schaffer 3 was scheduled<br />\nto become the setting for the<br />\npresentation of a work of art, as opposed<br />\nto a lecture. For a mere dollar (said the<br />\nman at the carnival) you can see Robert<br />\nCoover's (Yes!) film on the student<br />\nprotests of 1968 at Iowa State.<br />\nThe audience could have been divided<br />\nrrric<br /><br />\nOcs.c.<br /><br />\nnumber of people who were familiar with<br />\nCoover's novels or short stories, and a<br />\nplurality who had nothing else to do for<br />\nthe night.<br />\nMaybe it wasn't really significant what<br />\ncategory you were in, because almost no<br />\none noticed Coover walking down to the<br />\nfront of the room to take a seat,just like<br />\na..., an ordinary person.<br />\nFrankly, I expected someone who<br />\nwrote plays which required their actors<br />\nto inquire,\"My God, are you still kissing<br />\neach other?

The film chronicled the events<br />\n(violence) at Iowa State with the help of<br />\na sound track containing informal<br />\ninterviews with the people involved. The<br />\ninterviews were conducted a year after<br />\nthe events, so you watched anonymous<br />\npeople being threatened and sometimes<br />\nclubbed and dragged out of buildings<br />\nwhile equally anonymous voices calmly<br />\ntalked about it. Rather chilling. Some<br />\nparts of the film did have synchronized<br />\nsound. Sirens, screams, people singing,<br />\npeople arguing, speeches, sirens, sirens. It<br />\nwas very good from the standpoint of<br />\nnostalgia, which twenty year olds seem to<br />\ncrave intensely. People began to talk<br />\nabout \"the good old days\" at Homewood<br />\nHouse and what they did and what you<br />\ndid during that wonderful, wonderful<br />\nperiod of our lives.<br />\nCoover quietly explained that some of<br />\nthe most violent footage disappeared<br />\nsomewhere between the developing lab<br />\nand, to make a guess, the police.

Winter was a killer,<br />\nraking away the old and the infirm and<br />\nthe very young. Only in famine years did<br />\nstarvation take its toll. Men had enough<br />\nfood until the thawing of the ground and<br />\nthe plowing. In spring, however, the dying did not stop. Foodstores were depleted: the grain was often gone, there<br />\nwas no meat and little fish or game, berries had not yet appeared. Men would die<br />\nof starvation on the land they plowed.<br />\nThey lived on hope; while they lived,<br />\nthey found a way to get on with their<br />\nlives.<br />\nIn America, most of us don't worry<br />\nabout there being enough food to last<br />\nuntil the first harvests. We try to get on<br />\nwith our lives as best we can. The past<br />\nfew springs have been anomalies, times<br />\nwe did not get on with our lives, but tried<br />\nto express what we thought were their<br />\nmeanings.<br />\nIt hasn't been easy for me to take<br />\nto the streets. I had grown up with the<br />\nethic of a quieter time, believing that<br />\nonly great men would speak out against<br />\nthe stupidity of tyranny and self-serving<br />\nlies. I have grown up, though, over the<br />\npast four years following President<br />\nLyndon Johnson's announcement that<br />\nNorth Vietnam would no longer be<br />\nbombed, and that the war would soon<br />\nend. What happened in the streets of<br />\nChicago, and in Washington twice. and<br /><br />\nback in April of 1968 throughout the<br />\nnation's cities, has happened to all of<br />\nAmerica, and continues to go on in Vietnam and throughout the world.<br />\nNot only have we learned that Americs's is a brutal, self-serving, and declining'<br />\nculture, but we have also learned that<br />\nthere is little that we can do to change<br />\nthe situation. America has become a sort<br />\nof Newtonian world-clock-machine gone<br />\nawry, which produced on impulse the<br />\nacts and litanies of the past.<br />\nThe war in Indochina has grown up<br />\nwith us, and continues incomprehensible,<br />\nlike cancer. There seems little that can be<br />\ndone now, except to wait until the elections, which presumably will give America another chance. Two years ago, it<br />\nseems, a lot of people thought the war<br />\nwas almost over. Most of us who did not<br />\nwere called fools or worse; the sad fact is<br />\nthat in recent years, everyone who has<br />\nsincorely tried to stop the war has been<br />\ncalled a traitor. A Nixon aide recently<br />\naccused war protersers of consciously<br />\n\"aiding and abetting the enemy.\" We<br />\nhaven't heard talk like that since the heyday of General Westmoreland.<br /><br />\ntook a day off for politics.<br />\nSome might point to the strike two<br />\nyears ago to show the depth of student<br />\ninvolvement, but, let's face it, if there<br />\nhadn't been a Lincoln Gordon, and if<br />\nthere hadn't been tropical weather, then<br />\nthere probably wouldn't even have been a<br />\nstrike. For the average Hoppie, radical<br />\npolitics is something to be left to the<br />\nVillage Voice and Time magazine.<br />\nThe reason there have been little more<br />\nthan faint stirrings of anti-war action at<br />\nHopkins is that here, as throughout the<br />\nnation, people just want to get on with<br />\ntheir lives. Whether th,lit is possible these<br />\ndays remains an open question.<br /><br />\nPolitics at Hopkins<br />\nAll this brings us to the question of<br />\nwhy there's so little along the lines of war<br />\nprotest going on at Hopkins. The Hop has<br />\nalways been virtually dead. This must be<br />\nthe only school in America east of Oral<br />\nRoberts to feature the Army paratroopers at its spring festival. Half the<br />\nstudents here think they could never get<br />\ninto med school or law school if they<br /><br />\nSo he said he wanted a cone of French Vanilla, huh?<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\n\"Well, the other day this kid came in<br />\nhere and said he wanted a cone of French<br />\nVanilla. I asked him what that was, and<br />\nhe said it was a creamier vanilla. 'I don't<br />\nknow much about ice-cream', I told him,<br />\n'but I've never tasted creamier vanilla<br />\nthan this! So he tasted it, and liked it so<br />\nmuch he bought a triple cone.\"<br />\nSal Barone, the owner of the new<br />\nPeterson's ice-cream and candy store in<br />\nthe Rotunda, doesn't know much about<br />\nice-cream. But he's learning fast.<br />\n\"Only people who are happy come in<br />\nto buy ice-cream\", he says, \"and that<br />\nmakes it an attractive and cheerful business.\"<br />\nBarone is originally from Jersey City,<br />\nbut has lived in Baltimore for 16 years.<br />\nHe worked as a metallurgical manger at<br />\nRevere Copper and Brass in Baltimore,<br /><br />\nPtla<br /><br />\nRobert Coover: a man of,mmm contrasts<br /><br />\n2-2-2<br />\nSome call it a multi-million dollar<br />\nproposal now making the rounds of<br />\nvarious review committees which seeks to<br />\ncreate at Hopkins a brand new six year<br />\nintegrated undergraduate and medical<br />\nschool program. As with any such major<br />\nproposal, battle lines have been firmly<br />\ndrawn between proponents and<br />\nopponents high in the local power<br />\nstructures, and very little useful<br />\ncommentary has drifted down to the<br />\npotential beneficiaries or victims. As a<br />\nHopkins Medical School senior, former<br />\nHomewood undergraduate and 2-5<br />\nprogram participant, and erstwhile<br />\nresearcher in the Homewood Biophysics<br />\nDepartment, I would like to make a few<br />\nthoroughly jaundiced observations.<br />\nThe scheme, to be unfairly brief, is to<br />\ncreate a \"preclinical\" medical school<br />\nbased at Homewood in which students<br />\nentering directly from high school would<br />\ntake a continuously integrated<br />\ncurriculum (2-2-2) of liberal arts, medical<br />\nsciences and clinical medicine (at East<br />\nBaltimore) leading to a MD in six years.<br />\nThe few medical students asked about<br />\nthis idea have been reasonably sanguine,<br />\nstemming, one suspects, from the<br /><br />\nignore the sentiment of the people and continues the<br />\nwar in Vietnam, that fall may come sooner than<br />\nanyone had expected.<br />\nThis has been a long war. For seven years the protest<br />\nagainst the war has been going on. For seven years the<br />\ngovernment has ignored the sentiment of Americans<br />\nwho oppose the war, the bombing, and the domestic<br />\nproblems that the war has caused. For seven years, in<br />\nspite of endless protests and demands for change, the<br />\nAmerican government has pursued the same policy in<br />\nIndochina. Americans are plainly sick and tired of the<br />\nwar, but the government refuses to stop. For seven<br />\nsprings people have demonstrated against the war while<br />\nit has gone on and on, with more and more bombing<br />\nand more and more destruction and more and more<br />\ndeath. The regime that this war seeks to protect has<br />\nlong ago been discredited.<br /><br />\nuntil that company decided to close its<br />\nplant here.<br />\n\"They offered to transfer me to a little<br />\ntown in Indiana, North Liberty, I think\".<br />\nBarone really didn't want to go to North<br />\nLiberty, so he looked around; \"Being 43<br />\nyears old and of sound mind, I thought<br />\nthere was something else I could do.\" He<br />\nsaw an ad for a Peterson Ice Cream franchise in the Sun, and he checked out the<br />\nplace. When he saw the location, he<br />\nbecame enthusiastic and decided to go<br />\ninto the ice-cream business.<br />\nThe Rotunda is the only shopping mall<br />\nin an area of about 60,000 people, and<br />\nBarone gets a mixture of business ranging<br />\nfrom the next-door insurance company<br />\nlunch crowd to late night(until 10) Hopkins students' munchies. The mall is<br />\nrapidly filling up with stores, and the<br />\nHecht Co. is reportedly negotiating for a<br /><br />\nlease in the building. Barone got in on the<br />\nground floor, with a five-year lease and<br />\nan equally long option.<br />\nBarone uses about 100 gallons of<br />\nDolley Madison ice-cream every week,<br />\nbut he expects that to pick up with the<br />\nadvent of hot weather. His store also sells<br />\nfudge and chocolates, and the only help<br />\nhe has now include his son, daughter, and<br />\nher best friend, all teen-agers. He works<br />\nhard about twelve hours a day, and he is<br />\ndrawing a salary, though it is less than he<br />\nwas making as a metallurgist. Barone<br />\nseems to like being his own boss, and<br />\nwhen he is faced with the classic 'plop' of<br />\na newly-bought ice-cream cone on the<br />\ncarpet outside, he seems happy to give<br />\nthe poor kid a new cone. Like he says,<br />\n\"only happy people go out for icecream\", and he doesn't want to disappoint anyone.<br /><br />\nmeetings, he could forget about<br />\ncooperation in recovering his lost property<br />\nThe rumor was that the state police were<br />\nusing his un-returned film to \"prove\"<br />\nthat there had been a student riot.<br />\nComprehensive Account<br />\nCoover and three or four Iowa<br />\nstudents had informally worked together<br />\nduring the protest in order to come up<br />\nwith enough footage to make one<br />\ncomprehensive account of the events. It's<br />\nreasonable to wonder whether any<br />\nNews-Letter reader with some friends,<br />\naccess to 16mm equipment, and money<br />\nfor film couldn't have made an equally<br />\ninteresting production. But could you<br />\ncharge admission for people to see it?<br />\nDefinitely better than grad school.<br />\nRepresentatives from all three<br />\nsubdivisions of the audience were at a<br />\nreception for Coover after the films, and<br />\nCoover looked as if he had gone through<br />\nit all many times before. People patiently<br />\nstood in line to have an audience with<br />\nhim, and he would patiently listen and<br />\nreply to stupid or brilliant comments<br />\nabout the movie or his books or himself.<br />\nI had decided that he must do his<br />\nwriting by isolating himself in a plush<br />\nhome library and then painstakingly<br />\nsearch his mind for the perfect word for<br />\nThere should be no incongruities in the<br /><br />\nscheme, no contrasts. The earth is a<br />\nperfect circle and all the planets revolve<br />\naround something else in perfect circles.<br />\nUnfortunately, we're on a giant egg<br />\nwhich moves around in an elliptical path.<br />\nAnd Coover, although outwardly looking<br />\nthe same, became on Friday the man<br />\nimplied by his stories as he read \"Cat in<br />\nthe Hat,\" inspired by our childhood<br />\ncompanion, Dr. Seuss. He said he wrote it<br />\nin a hotel room, not a library.<br />\nNow, if you're still restricted to<br />\nreading pre-Robert Coover fiction, let me<br />\njust say that Coover's stories occasionally<br />\nedge close to the line which separates art<br />\nfrom pornography, as one of his editors<br />\nrecently put it. That type of story does<br />\nnot imply, for me, a creator with a fine<br />\nspeaking voice, a smile for the individuals<br />\nhe recognized from the night before, and<br />\nwith glasses for reading his manuscript.<br />\nHe read the story with a degree of<br />\nenthusiasm that would outrage the type<br />\nof person which we usually visualize<br />\nwhen we think of people who wear black<br />\nsuits and black shoes. Contrasts, my<br />\nfriends.<br />\nThe story: The Cat in the Hat was<br />\nrunning for President against the<br />\nincumbent who was \"taciturn but<br />\negregrious\u2014in short, a natural.\" One of<br />\nthe slogans of the Cat's bizzare campaign<br />\nwas \"Mee-yew,\" but the Garrett Room<br />\naudience really went for the special<br />\nbathroom slogan, \"What this nation<br />\nneeds is more pussy.\" Good 'ol male<br />\nhumor.<br />\nConvention Slogan<br />\nThe convention slogan was, \"Have no<br />\nfear of this mess.\" The Hopkins audience<br />\ndidn't stop laughing even when Coover's<br />\ncharacters pointed out that \"the cat's<br />\nantics expose the madness of normalcy.\"<br />\n\"It's enough to say that the Cat didn't<br />\nget elected bacause of some gruesome<br />\npre-election day complications. The<br />\ncomplications were actually only<br />\nenlargements of what we label<br />\n\"normalcy.\"<br />\nBut what about Robert Coover\u2014who is<br />\nRobert Coover? There are several<br />\npossibilities: An unexceptional film<br />\nmaker, the person who writes what one<br />\nprofessor called \"the thickest stories I've<br />\nread by a modern author,\" a somewhat<br />\ndapper man who is concerned with the<br />\nquality of life, or a man who can cause<br />\nhis readers to laugh hysterically because<br />\nof the outrageousness of what he writes<br />\n(thinks?).<br />\nHe was introduced as \"one of the most<br />\ninnovative men in American letters,\" and<br />\nthat's about what you would expect from<br />\na man so full of harmonious opposites.<br />\nContrasts (\"a diversity of adjacent parts<br />\nin color, emotion, tone\"), contrasts, you<br />\nknow.<br /><br />\npage 8/news-letter/april 21, 1972<br
