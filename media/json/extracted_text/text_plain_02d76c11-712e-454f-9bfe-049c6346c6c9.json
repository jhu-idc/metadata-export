Wilson Shaffer<br />\n<br />\nThe End Of The Tether<br />\nThe ominous statements of Judge Hudnet and the<br />\nBaltimore police concerning night life on North Calvert<br />\nStreet (see page 1) face Hopkins fraternities with a<br />\nclear cut crisis. While no drastic crackdown seems pending, the delicate balance which has preserved harmony<br />\nin the past was disrupted by the four arrests last weekend. Unless equilibrium is restored an unfortunate<br />\nsituation could become disastrous.<br />\nThere can be no doubt that last weekend's arrests<br />\nrepresent the working of forces in no way extraordinary.<br />\nRush parties are never quiet affairs and, given the concentration of fraternity houses on Calvert Street, it is<br />\nnot surprising that the patience of neighbors and police<br />\nis exhausted after four weekends of rush. Neither is it<br />\nsurprising that the incidents should involve underclassmen, a notoriously indiscreet breed at best.<br />\nBut the fact remains that two serious warnings<br />\nhave been issued. To ignore them under the circumstances would be foolish. It has been made abundantly<br />\nclear that unless fraternities restrain themselves for a<br />\nwhile serious trouble could develop. If increased police<br />\nsurveilance results in more arrests, if Judge Hudnet<br />\nmakes good his threat to \"make an example\" of the next<br />\nviolator of the liquor laws, the fraternities could lose<br />\ncontrol of the situation to the point that University<br />\nintervention is required. This would necessarily place<br />\nthem under the wing of the University administrators,<br />\na haven they have stubbornly refused in the past, and<br />\nput an abrupt end to their carefree independence.<br />\nFaced with an indefensible legal position, a less<br />\nflexible attitude on the part of city authorities and the<br />\nspectre of University control, the fraternities can only<br />\nlie low, exercise discretion in their activities anti wait<br />\nfor the air to clear. The only positive action they can<br />\ntake is to see that no further incidents take place outside<br />\nthe houses.<br />\nRealizing this the I.F.C. has, quite properly, taken<br />\nno police action. Hopefully the University too will stick<br />\nto its hands off policy and allow things to work themselves out as they have in the past.<br />\n<br />\nAfter Therrnopolae<br />\nThe termination of this year's rushing season was<br />\nexciting because it tested the predictions of both optimistic anti pessimistic undergraduates who speculated<br />\nfor a year on the results of the administration's transference of the season from fall to winter.<br />\nWhen the COUGA announced the sweeping<br />\nchanges in undergraduate life last year, several questions<br />\nwere immediatley raised regarding fraternities. Would<br />\nthe IFC he able to enforce the new rushing system?<br />\nWould the revised system prove adequate or would it<br />\ndeal a death blow to certain fraternities? Would freshmen houses diminish freshmen interest in fraternities?<br />\nAt that time, many Greeks feared that some fraternities would be unable to weather the storm w hit+ would<br />\nbeset them this year. We now find that all fraternities<br />\nare decidedly afloat, some of them taking record breaking numbers of pledges.<br />\nThe WC proved itself quite capable of coping with<br />\nthe sivation and even succeeded in convincing the<br />\nCOUGA to change the pledge day from April, as it had<br />\nplanned, to March. Fraternity cooperation with the<br />\nadministration's effort united and strengthened the social<br />\nhouses rather than destroyed them.<br />\nIn spite of the remakable success of second semester rushing, the system still contains certain weaknesses. Freshmen were given no real opportunity to<br />\nunderstand the fraternity system until the first week of<br />\nthis semester when fraternity house doors were opened<br />\nto them for the first time. Only then were rumors anti<br />\nopinions dispelled. The present system certainly could<br />\nbe modified so that fraternities would be allowed to<br />\nhold one or two open houses in the fall.<br />\nThis would give freshmen a better chance to observe<br />\nthe fraternity system and the individual fraternities and<br />\nwould he perfectly in line with the administration's<br />\nglom&<br />\n<br />\nBook Displays Virtuosity<br />\nGilbert Highet, THE ANATOMY<br />\nOF SATIRE, Princeton University Press, 1962, 301 PP.<br />\nThe Anatomy of Satire originated as a series of lectures<br />\ngiven to students at Princeton<br />\nUniversity. While it is possible<br />\nthat this is so, it is more likely<br />\nthat the manuscript underwent<br />\ndrastic revision before its publication in book form. Unfortunately, the revision was not<br />\ndrastic enough, for although the<br />\nbook retains several of the virtues of a lecture, it manages to<br />\nretain most of the faults likely<br />\nto incur in a tome which originated as a talk.<br />\nThe virtues are obvious. The<br />\nbook is an extremely easy one,<br />\nand one which does not lose its<br />\nreader along the way. Written<br />\nin an almost conversational tone,<br />\nit lulls the reader along from<br />\n<br />\nchapter to chapter in a manner<br />\nwhich deviates considerably from<br />\nthe ordinary dryness to be found<br />\nin reading scholarly material.<br />\nThis ease is broken only by the<br />\nthirty-odd pages of notes at<br />\nthe end of the book, to which a<br />\nconscientious reader must refer,<br />\nand which do much to break the<br />\nmuch strived for continuity of<br />\nthe prose.<br />\nThe faults, however, are many.<br />\nIt would seem that Highet, a<br />\nProfessor of Latin Language and<br />\nLiterature at Columbia, felt<br />\nhimself obligated to demonstrate, both to his listeners at<br />\nPrinceton and to his readers,<br />\nthat he deserved his title. The<br />\nresult is a virtuoso display of<br />\nthe first order which, unfortunately, proves little.

Wilson Shaffer<br />\nOffice of the Dean of the Faculty<br />\nHomewood House<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nCharles & 34th Sts.<br />\nBaltimore 18, Md.<br />\nDear Dean Shaffer:<br />\nI am pleased that you remember me. You may recall that I<br />\nspent the school years of 1957-60<br />\nas \"Assistant to the Dean\" of<br />\nMcCoy College. This fine sounding title meant that I was the<br />\nevening receptionist. During that<br />\ntime I was privileged to meet and<br />\ncome to know many of the Hopkins staff. I knew others as instructors during my daytime<br />\nclasses. I believe that I was sufficiently in touch with the operation of our University to know<br />\na great deal about it.<br />\nI am completing my third year<br />\nat law school at the University<br />\nof Illinois. The organizational<br />\nsystem is greatly dissimilar from<br />\nthat at Hopkins. The opportunity to compare these institutions has been valuable and in- ,<br />\nstructive.<br />\nMy background has influenced ,<br />\nme. I see few active and interested citizens around me. I have<br />\nattempted to become an active<br />\nand interested citizen, seeking to<br />\nferret out both sides of importantl<br />\nproblems of the day. It is the<br />\nduty of each citizen to seek out l<br />\nthe different positions, discuss !<br />\nand assess them, and choose and<br />\npromote the position most acceptable to him as an adequate<br />\nand responsible policy choice in<br />\nour Republic.<br />\nDifferent factors interplay to<br />\naid us in such objective and<br />\nnecessary introspection. Basic is<br />\nthe climate of the home and<br />\nthe attitude and approach of<br />\nthose effecting our early education. Unavoidable inaccuracies<br />\nIn information are encountered.<br />\nParents may be disinterested or<br />\nmisinformed. Newspapers and<br />\nother periodicals rarely present<br />\nthe views of both liberals and<br />\nconservatives. True perspective<br />\nis difficult to achieve and just<br />\nas hard to maintain. It is the<br />\nteacher who has become the central figure in the educational<br />\nprocess.<br />\nThe high school graduate enters college feeling ready to join<br />\nsociety and anxious to do so, not<br />\nrealizing or being willing to admit the inherent weaknesses present in his knowledge. The<br />\nspirit of independence renders<br />\n<br />\nInstructors should feel free<br />\nto speak on politics so long as<br />\nthey make it clear that they are<br />\npresenting, opinion, not fact.<br />\nEach teacher holds his student's<br />\nmind in trust. That mind must<br />\nnot be consciously mislead. If<br />\nindependent thought is to be encouraged on topics necessitating<br />\npolitical judgments both the liberal and the conservative position must be coherently presented. Discussion must be encouraged. The student has the<br />\nright to choose his politics, himself. Conclusions are beyond the<br />\n(Continued on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\naccompanied by a seven page<br />\ntable of contents, which looks<br />\nmore like an outline for some<br />\nfreshman's English Writing term<br />\npaper than a table of contents<br />\nfor a serious book. The table<br />\ngives a list of most of the works<br />\ndiscussed wihin, something completely unnecessary, for the<br />\nworks alluded to are rarely discussed in any detail, but rather<br />\nglossed over lightly. The reason<br />\nfor this seems to be that Highet<br />\nis more interested in persuading<br />\npeople that he has read most<br />\nof this material, some of it highly obscure, than he is in talking<br />\nabout it. Dickens' Pickwick<br />\nPapers, for example, rates two<br />\nparagraphs, and Cervantes' Don<br />\nQuixote, an admittedly obscure<br />\nwork, is profoundly treated in<br />\ntwo sentences.<br />\nThe two most interesting parts<br />\nof the book are the Introduction and the Conclusion. These<br />\ntwo parts, unlike the main part<br />\nof the book, have two things in<br />\ncommon. Both are short and<br />\nneither comes to any conclusion.<br />\nThe first tells how to recognize<br />\nsatire, and quickly throws out<br />\neverything as a possible guide,<br />\nmaking only the most obvious<br />\nand general conclusions; the<br />\nsecond tells us the purpose and<br />\ntype of satire, and again throws<br />\n(Continued on Page 8)<br />\n<br />\nTHE GREENWAY<br />\nPHARMACY<br />\nCharles anti 34th Street<br />\n<br />\nMEDICO<br />\nJET-STREAra<br />\nFILTER PIPES<br />\nNEWEST SHAPES<br />\n, IMPORTED BRIAR<br />\n<br />\n$3.95<br />\n<br />\nSCHRUM'S OUTLINES<br />\nIncluding THEORY and<br />\nSOLVED PROBLEMS<br />\n<br />\nCollege Physics .....$2.50 Matrices<br />\nincluding 625 SOLVED PROBLEMS<br />\nEdited by CAREL W. van der<br />\nMERWE, Ph.

The<br />\nwhole idea of the car was born at one of the great<br />\nEuropean automobile shows. The then president of<br />\nour company pointed to some of the small, lush sports<br />\ncars that are always a center of attention at such<br />\nshows and asked his companion,\"Why can't we build<br />\nsomething like these?\u201d<br />\n<br />\nThe companion, who later became a vice president<br />\nof the company, said, \"It just so happens I have one<br />\non the boards. I'll show it to you when we get back to<br />\nDetroit.\" Then as fast as he could discreetly get to a<br />\ntransatlantic telephone he called his assistant and told<br />\nhim,\"Remember that car we've been talking about?<br />\nFinish those sketches on it.\"<br />\nThe Thunderbird became one of the few cars ever<br />\nbuilt that was produced essentially as the original<br />\nsketches presented it. Most cars undergo countless<br />\nchanges in the design period. But there was a natural<br />\nclarity and cleanness to the Thunderbird design that<br />\nimmediately captured all of us at Ford.<br />\nIt was probably this clean, sharp look that won so<br />\nmany friends so fast when the car went into production. That first Thunderbird had its drawbacks. For<br />\nexample, it was too soft-sprung for true sports-car<br />\nhandling. But, the truth is, it was not designed in the<br />\nEuropean tradition of the fast performance car. Some<br />\npeople called it a sports car but we never did. We<br />\ncalled it a \"personal\" car; a small, fairly luxurious car<br />\nthat was fun to look at and fun to drive. It had its<br />\nown integrity: it was one alone.<br />\nWe built the Thunderbird as a bellwether car for<br />\nFord. It was our intention to test new ideas before<br />\nwe put them into our Fords, Fairlanes and Falcons.<br />\nThe new Ford ride and Swing-Away steering wheel<br />\nappeared first on the Thunderbird, for instance. lowever, we never foresaw the extraordinary influence<br />\nThunderbird would have on the whole automobile<br />\nbusiness here and abroad. Almost everybody offers<br />\nthe Thunderbird bucket seats these days. And the<br />\nThunderbird look is the most decisive styling of the '60s.<br />\nThe Thunderbird is a classic, made so by a peculiar<br />\nblend of magic ingredients of which we would love<br />\nto know the secret. We're building cars right now we<br />\nhope will become classics, but the truth is, we don't<br />\nmake classics, we make cars. People make the car a<br />\nclassic. And that's the story of the Thunderbird.<br />\n<br />\nAmerica's liveliest,<br />\nmost care-free cars!<br />\n<br />\nFORD<br />\nFALCON.FAiotAtit \u2022 FORD \u2022TAINDERBIRD<br />\n<br />\nFOR 60 YEARS THE SYMBOL OF DEPENDABLE PRODUCTS CcW/Ay<br />\nL<br />\n) MOTOR COMPANY A<br />\n<br />\nFrat Rolls Up 7%<br />\nAs Three-Week<br />\nRushing Ends<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\nDavid<br />\nMarek.<br />\n<br />\nMcCutcheon,<br />\n<br />\nCharles<br />\n<br />\nPhi Epsilon Pi: Larry Corman,<br />\nStephen Feinstone, Fred Fogelson, Howard Goldberg, Paul Joseph, Howard Kirschenbaum.

Last year, graduation took<br />\nevery starting pitcher, including<br />\nDave Leonard who recently signed with the Baltimore Oriole<br />\norganization.<br />\nPitching prospects for this year<br />\ninclude several inexperienced<br />\nhurlers, including John Ciliberti,<br />\nFrank Soriano, Ron Kochis, and<br />\npossibly Dick Bower, George Law,<br />\nand cage star Bill Characklis.<br />\nOutside of the pitching staff, the<br />\noutlook is good with the return<br />\nof seven lettermen, including cocaptains Leon Poffenberger and<br />\n2nd team Mason-Dixon outfielder Joe Gotwals.<br />\nOthers include Peter Thompson, Bob Ramsberg, William<br />\nDempsey, Dennis Donnelly and<br />\nKenneth Lieblein. A good<br />\nbunch of sophomores are also<br />\nout, including long bailer George<br />\nLaw, Charles McIntyre, and<br />\nMartin O'Connell. Sachs hopes<br />\nthat these sophs along with the<br />\nveterans will pick up the usually weak hitting of previous Hopkins' teams. He hopes to put out<br />\na hitting lineup that will be<br />\nstrong throughout.<br />\n<br />\nmay play outfield, infield, or<br />\npitch was a top hitter for the<br />\nfrosh team last year, as well as<br />\nwith a local amateur team.<br />\n<br />\nBOB<br />\n<br />\nMILLER<br />\n<br />\nThe 1963 Blue Jay track squad<br />\nsuffers from a serious lack of<br />\ndepth, particularly in the field<br />\nevents.

Wilson Shaffer<br /><br />\nThe End Of The Tether<br />\nThe ominous statements of Judge Hudnet and the<br />\nBaltimore police concerning night life on North Calvert<br />\nStreet (see page 1) face Hopkins fraternities with a<br />\nclear cut crisis. While no drastic crackdown seems pending, the delicate balance which has preserved harmony<br />\nin the past was disrupted by the four arrests last weekend. Unless equilibrium is restored an unfortunate<br />\nsituation could become disastrous.<br />\nThere can be no doubt that last weekend's arrests<br />\nrepresent the working of forces in no way extraordinary.<br />\nRush parties are never quiet affairs and, given the concentration of fraternity houses on Calvert Street, it is<br />\nnot surprising that the patience of neighbors and police<br />\nis exhausted after four weekends of rush. Neither is it<br />\nsurprising that the incidents should involve underclassmen, a notoriously indiscreet breed at best.<br />\nBut the fact remains that two serious warnings<br />\nhave been issued. To ignore them under the circumstances would be foolish. It has been made abundantly<br />\nclear that unless fraternities restrain themselves for a<br />\nwhile serious trouble could develop. If increased police<br />\nsurveilance results in more arrests, if Judge Hudnet<br />\nmakes good his threat to \"make an example\" of the next<br />\nviolator of the liquor laws, the fraternities could lose<br />\ncontrol of the situation to the point that University<br />\nintervention is required. This would necessarily place<br />\nthem under the wing of the University administrators,<br />\na haven they have stubbornly refused in the past, and<br />\nput an abrupt end to their carefree independence.<br />\nFaced with an indefensible legal position, a less<br />\nflexible attitude on the part of city authorities and the<br />\nspectre of University control, the fraternities can only<br />\nlie low, exercise discretion in their activities anti wait<br />\nfor the air to clear. The only positive action they can<br />\ntake is to see that no further incidents take place outside<br />\nthe houses.<br />\nRealizing this the I.F.C. has, quite properly, taken<br />\nno police action. Hopefully the University too will stick<br />\nto its hands off policy and allow things to work themselves out as they have in the past.<br /><br />\nAfter Therrnopolae<br />\nThe termination of this year's rushing season was<br />\nexciting because it tested the predictions of both optimistic anti pessimistic undergraduates who speculated<br />\nfor a year on the results of the administration's transference of the season from fall to winter.<br />\nWhen the COUGA announced the sweeping<br />\nchanges in undergraduate life last year, several questions<br />\nwere immediatley raised regarding fraternities. Would<br />\nthe IFC he able to enforce the new rushing system?<br />\nWould the revised system prove adequate or would it<br />\ndeal a death blow to certain fraternities? Would freshmen houses diminish freshmen interest in fraternities?<br />\nAt that time, many Greeks feared that some fraternities would be unable to weather the storm w hit+ would<br />\nbeset them this year. We now find that all fraternities<br />\nare decidedly afloat, some of them taking record breaking numbers of pledges.<br />\nThe WC proved itself quite capable of coping with<br />\nthe sivation and even succeeded in convincing the<br />\nCOUGA to change the pledge day from April, as it had<br />\nplanned, to March. Fraternity cooperation with the<br />\nadministration's effort united and strengthened the social<br />\nhouses rather than destroyed them.<br />\nIn spite of the remakable success of second semester rushing, the system still contains certain weaknesses. Freshmen were given no real opportunity to<br />\nunderstand the fraternity system until the first week of<br />\nthis semester when fraternity house doors were opened<br />\nto them for the first time. Only then were rumors anti<br />\nopinions dispelled. The present system certainly could<br />\nbe modified so that fraternities would be allowed to<br />\nhold one or two open houses in the fall.<br />\nThis would give freshmen a better chance to observe<br />\nthe fraternity system and the individual fraternities and<br />\nwould he perfectly in line with the administration's<br />\nglom&amp;<br /><br />\nBook Displays Virtuosity<br />\nGilbert Highet, THE ANATOMY<br />\nOF SATIRE, Princeton University Press, 1962, 301 PP.<br />\nThe Anatomy of Satire originated as a series of lectures<br />\ngiven to students at Princeton<br />\nUniversity. While it is possible<br />\nthat this is so, it is more likely<br />\nthat the manuscript underwent<br />\ndrastic revision before its publication in book form. Unfortunately, the revision was not<br />\ndrastic enough, for although the<br />\nbook retains several of the virtues of a lecture, it manages to<br />\nretain most of the faults likely<br />\nto incur in a tome which originated as a talk.<br />\nThe virtues are obvious. The<br />\nbook is an extremely easy one,<br />\nand one which does not lose its<br />\nreader along the way. Written<br />\nin an almost conversational tone,<br />\nit lulls the reader along from<br /><br />\nchapter to chapter in a manner<br />\nwhich deviates considerably from<br />\nthe ordinary dryness to be found<br />\nin reading scholarly material.<br />\nThis ease is broken only by the<br />\nthirty-odd pages of notes at<br />\nthe end of the book, to which a<br />\nconscientious reader must refer,<br />\nand which do much to break the<br />\nmuch strived for continuity of<br />\nthe prose.<br />\nThe faults, however, are many.<br />\nIt would seem that Highet, a<br />\nProfessor of Latin Language and<br />\nLiterature at Columbia, felt<br />\nhimself obligated to demonstrate, both to his listeners at<br />\nPrinceton and to his readers,<br />\nthat he deserved his title. The<br />\nresult is a virtuoso display of<br />\nthe first order which, unfortunately, proves little.

You may recall that I<br />\nspent the school years of 1957-60<br />\nas \"Assistant to the Dean\" of<br />\nMcCoy College. This fine sounding title meant that I was the<br />\nevening receptionist. During that<br />\ntime I was privileged to meet and<br />\ncome to know many of the Hopkins staff. I knew others as instructors during my daytime<br />\nclasses. I believe that I was sufficiently in touch with the operation of our University to know<br />\na great deal about it.<br />\nI am completing my third year<br />\nat law school at the University<br />\nof Illinois. The organizational<br />\nsystem is greatly dissimilar from<br />\nthat at Hopkins. The opportunity to compare these institutions has been valuable and in- ,<br />\nstructive.<br />\nMy background has influenced ,<br />\nme. I see few active and interested citizens around me. I have<br />\nattempted to become an active<br />\nand interested citizen, seeking to<br />\nferret out both sides of importantl<br />\nproblems of the day. It is the<br />\nduty of each citizen to seek out l<br />\nthe different positions, discuss !<br />\nand assess them, and choose and<br />\npromote the position most acceptable to him as an adequate<br />\nand responsible policy choice in<br />\nour Republic.<br />\nDifferent factors interplay to<br />\naid us in such objective and<br />\nnecessary introspection. Basic is<br />\nthe climate of the home and<br />\nthe attitude and approach of<br />\nthose effecting our early education. Unavoidable inaccuracies<br />\nIn information are encountered.<br />\nParents may be disinterested or<br />\nmisinformed. Newspapers and<br />\nother periodicals rarely present<br />\nthe views of both liberals and<br />\nconservatives. True perspective<br />\nis difficult to achieve and just<br />\nas hard to maintain.

The table<br />\ngives a list of most of the works<br />\ndiscussed wihin, something completely unnecessary, for the<br />\nworks alluded to are rarely discussed in any detail, but rather<br />\nglossed over lightly. The reason<br />\nfor this seems to be that Highet<br />\nis more interested in persuading<br />\npeople that he has read most<br />\nof this material, some of it highly obscure, than he is in talking<br />\nabout it.

Mr. Crimscott's<br />\nexams were murder\u2014plain, flat murder. They consisted of one<br />\nhundred questions, each question having four possible answers<br />\n\u2014A,B, C,and D.

We should be out singing and<br />\ndancing and cutting didoes on the greensward! Instead we<br />\nare here.\"<br />\nThen, suddenly, an absolute gasser of an idea hit Choate.<br />\n\"Listen!\" he shouted to his classmates. \"Tomorrow when we<br />\ntake the exam, let's all\u2014every one of us\u2014check Choice 'A' on<br />\nevery question\u2014every one of them.\"<br />\n\"Huh?\" said his classmates.<br />\n\"Oh, I know that Choice 'A' can't be the right answer to<br />\nevery question,\" said Choate. \"But what's the difference?

The<br />\nwhole idea of the car was born at one of the great<br />\nEuropean automobile shows. The then president of<br />\nour company pointed to some of the small, lush sports<br />\ncars that are always a center of attention at such<br />\nshows and asked his companion,\"Why can't we build<br />\nsomething like these?\u201d<br /><br />\nThe companion, who later became a vice president<br />\nof the company, said, \"It just so happens I have one<br />\non the boards. I'll show it to you when we get back to<br />\nDetroit.\" Then as fast as he could discreetly get to a<br />\ntransatlantic telephone he called his assistant and told<br />\nhim,\"Remember that car we've been talking about?<br />\nFinish those sketches on it.\"<br />\nThe Thunderbird became one of the few cars ever<br />\nbuilt that was produced essentially as the original<br />\nsketches presented it. Most cars undergo countless<br />\nchanges in the design period. But there was a natural<br />\nclarity and cleanness to the Thunderbird design that<br />\nimmediately captured all of us at Ford.<br />\nIt was probably this clean, sharp look that won so<br />\nmany friends so fast when the car went into production. That first Thunderbird had its drawbacks. For<br />\nexample, it was too soft-sprung for true sports-car<br />\nhandling. But, the truth is, it was not designed in the<br />\nEuropean tradition of the fast performance car. Some<br />\npeople called it a sports car but we never did. We<br />\ncalled it a \"personal\" car; a small, fairly luxurious car<br />\nthat was fun to look at and fun to drive. It had its<br />\nown integrity: it was one alone.<br />\nWe built the Thunderbird as a bellwether car for<br />\nFord. It was our intention to test new ideas before<br />\nwe put them into our Fords, Fairlanes and Falcons.<br />\nThe new Ford ride and Swing-Away steering wheel<br />\nappeared first on the Thunderbird, for instance. lowever, we never foresaw the extraordinary influence<br />\nThunderbird would have on the whole automobile<br />\nbusiness here and abroad. Almost everybody offers<br />\nthe Thunderbird bucket seats these days. And the<br />\nThunderbird look is the most decisive styling of the '60s.<br />\nThe Thunderbird is a classic, made so by a peculiar<br />\nblend of magic ingredients of which we would love<br />\nto know the secret.
