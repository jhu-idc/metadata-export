It was 6.30 and<br />\nalmost dusk when the final whistle<br />\nblew, and Captains Stuart and<br />\nGriffiss decided to call it a day<br />\nafter two hours of hard playing.<br />\nThe playing of the Varsity exceeded the fondest hopes of the<br />\ncoaches, their passing, dodging<br />\n\u2022 and general play against their experienced opponents being excellent for a green team playing<br />\ntheir first game of the season.<br />\nThe Alumni started off with a<br />\n\u2022 rush, and the Varsity goal was in<br />\ndanger from the very first. The<br />\ndefense played steady, however,<br />\nand stopped several strong advances until Baxley shot one past<br />\nBenedict, the ball being sent down<br />\nthe field by beautiful passes from<br />\nSchmeisser to Wolfe to Baxley,<br />\nand the play then started up in<br />\nearnest, LaMotte getting the ball<br />\non the crease and making a pretty<br />\ncorner shot. Griffiss scored first<br />\nfor the Varsity by dodging<br />\nSchmidt and working the ball in<br />\n\u2022 past Stuart for a goal. The play<br />\nwas centered around the Alumni's<br />\ngoal by this time, and it was only<br />\nthrough the wonderful work \u2022 of<br />\nEddie Stuart at goal that the Varsity did not score much more frequently. The Varsity was just<br />\ngetting started, while the Alumni,<br />\nthrough lack of training, were<br />\npretty well fagged when the half<br />\nended with the score 2 to 1 in their<br />\nfavor.<br />\nThe second half started off with<br />\na goal from midfield by Chas.<br />\nWolfe, who played a very fast<br />\ngame at center. The -play was so<br />\nthick around him that he had to<br />\nquit immediately after this as the<br />\n\u2022 result of someone's stock landing<br />\non him, breaking his nose.<br />\n\"Dutch\" Kauffman replaced him<br />\nat center. The Varsity then settled down to work, and two goals<br />\nby Griffiss and one by Bauernschmidt placed them in the lead.<br />\nBauernschmidt's shot was a beautiful .1)iece of stick work. He re\u2022 ceived the ball from behind the<br />\ngoal, and after dodging past the<br />\nAlumni's inner defense shot a<br />\npretty goal. The Alumni scored<br />\nnext, but Bauernschmidt came<br />\nback with a shot from the crease,<br />\nputting the Varsity in the lead<br />\nagain. Baxley then made a free<br />\nshot, and Johnny Knipp put the<br />\nAlumni head, making the prettiest<br />\n(Continued on page 8 col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nCotton To Be Business Manager\u2014Next<br />\nIssue To Appear April 20\u2014Last<br />\nNumber Of Year To Be<br />\nGrads' Number.<br />\n<br />\nOn the resignations of the<br />\nSenior members of the Black and<br />\nBlue Jay staff Lawrence B.

Ralph F. Bowers<br />\npresided, and Bartow Griffiss<br />\nmade the presentation. The new<br />\nmembers of the organization are:<br />\nElmer Jones, '21; Frederick R.<br />\nCalkins, Jr., '21; Johns U. Markel], '22; Richard N. Wood, '22,<br />\nand Forgraves,'23.<br />\nThe dance, which was the first<br />\ngiven by the fraternity, proved a<br />\ngreat success in every way. Dancing started at 9 o'clock and continued until midnight. Johnson's<br />\nOrchestra supplied the music,<br />\nwhich was greatly improved when<br />\n\"Mike\" Bowers took his turn at<br />\nthe piano. Light refreshments<br />\nwere served during the intermissions. The arrangements were in<br />\nthe hands of a committee composed of H.P. Brawner,0. S. Wilkinson and J. J.

The<br />\nsteadily increasing cost of printing was the chief obstable.<br />\nThe question of the management<br />\nand distribution of the fund was<br />\ndiscussed at length, but no definite<br />\ndecision was reached. It is probable, however, that the money will<br />\nbe deposited in a lump sum subject to check, and the following<br />\nscheme of distribution be used:<br />\nAll checks must be signed by some<br />\none person, to be selected later,<br />\nwho will keep the books for all activities and will represent the<br />\nFaculty Committee. The checks<br />\nwill, in addition, be countersigned<br />\nby the business manager or some<br />\none designated officer of the activity by whom it is drawn. No bills<br />\nwill be. paid without adequate<br />\nvouchers, and the books will be<br />\nopen to inspection at all times.<br />\nAny additioiltal money procured by \u2022<br />\nan activity will be deposited to the<br />\ncredit of that activity in the general fund, and any surplus at the<br />\nend of the year will be carried<br />\nover to the credit of the organization in the following year. The<br />\nexpenses of the bookkeeper, vouchers and a surplus to meet probable<br />\ndeficits will in all likelihood be<br />\nprovided by taking 10 per cent.<br />\nof the total sum collected and placing it to the credit of the Varsity<br />\nSeal Voting Council, subject to<br />\nsome restrictions, with the authority to make such payments.<br />\nAnother meeting will be held in<br />\nthe near future, and this question<br />\nwill then be definitely decided.<br />\n<br />\nPRICE 10 CENTS<br />\nHOPKINS SHUT OUT BY<br />\nDELAWARE COLLEGE<br />\nBASEBALLERS<br />\nFailure to Hit at Opportune Times<br />\nLoses Game for J.

The first<br />\ninning proved disastrous to Hopkins, very loose playing by the<br />\ninfield giving the Josephites five<br />\nruns, four of which were unearned.<br />\nAfter this the team settled down<br />\nand Ellicott, who pitched a splendid game throughout, had the<br />\ngame in his own hands. Mount<br />\nSt. Josephs only made two scattered hits in the other six innings,<br />\ntheir other run coming from a<br />\npassed ball. The Freshmen got<br />\nto Brehm in the sixth and knocked<br />\nin three runs after two were out.<br />\nHutzler, who took Morovitz's<br />\nplace at first, knocked in two of<br />\nthese runs with a long hit to left<br />\nfield, which only netted him two<br />\nbases, as he slipped rounding first<br />\nbase. Strouse and Donetell played<br />\nwell for the Freshmen, the former<br />\nmaking a one-hand stab at a line<br />\ndrive in the seventh which prevented a run, and the latter making two clean hits in four times<br />\nup. Brehm pitched a steady game<br />\nfor Mount St. Joseph. With more<br />\nconstant practice and a better<br />\nbalanced line-up the Freshmen<br />\nshould put out a team which will<br />\nbe up to the standard of their<br />\nother teams and give trouble to<br />\nlocal prep schools.

Bishop Nicolai, who was introduced by<br />\nPresident Goodnow, astounded his<br />\naudience with the stories of the<br />\nmassacres of his countrymen by<br />\nthe Turks, who always either<br />\nkilled or converted their captives<br />\nwho were of any religious sect<br />\nother then theirs. He also stated<br />\nthat the Serbian losses in the war<br />\nwere 1,300,000 lives out of a population of 4,000,000, representing a<br />\nloss greater then the combined<br />\nlosses of England and America.<br />\nIn conclusion Bishop Nicolai<br />\nurged everyone to help, not merely<br />\nmaterially, but spiritually, stricken Europe to recover her position<br />\nas the bulwark of civilization.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins .<br />\n.0 0 0 0 0 3 0-3<br />\nMt.

Within<br />\nthe last two weeks the team has<br />\nplayed four of its games, winning<br />\none, tying one and losing one (the<br />\nresult of last Saturday's game is<br />\nstill in doubt as we go to press),<br />\nbut in every case showing a quality of playing that has not been<br />\npresent in Black and Blue nines<br />\nfor several years. This quality<br />\nfirst became manifest when the<br />\nteam journeyed to Charlottesville<br />\non March 26 and beat the University of Virginia by the score of<br />\n11 to 5. The result of the Virginia setto came as a decided surprise to most people, especially<br />\nas Hopkins this spring has a team<br />\ncomposed largely of new and hitherto untried men.<br />\nThe game with Delaware on<br />\nMarch 28 resulted in a tie. Both<br />\nteams had made five runs at the<br />\nend of the ninth inning when it<br />\nbecame too dark for further playing.<br />\nThe game scheduled with the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania for<br />\nMarch 31 was called on account<br />\nof rain.<br />\nOn Saturday, April 2, Dartmouth defeated Hopkins at Homewood by getting three runs in the<br />\n*ninth, making the final score 6<br />\nto 3.<br />\nIn the game with Virginia<br />\nTucker pitched until the sixth<br />\ninning, when Marchetti took the<br />\nbox until the finish.<br />\nThe Virginians started off well, bagging<br />\ntwo runs in the first inning,<br />\nwhile Hopkins did not score till<br />\nthe third, when Grace crossed<br />\nthe plate for their initial run of<br />\nthe season. Sexton, of Virginia,<br />\nbrought his team's score up to<br />\nthree runs in the third, at which<br />\ntally it remained until the seventh.<br />\nIt was the fifth that was the lucky<br />\ninning for J. H. U. Hayter,<br />\nSharrets, Wood, Knecht and Reifschneider crossed the plate one<br />\nafter the other. Bill Wood scored<br />\nagain in the sixth, and in the<br />\nseventh and eighth four more runs<br />\nbrought the score to 11 to 5.<br />\nIn the Johns Hopkins-Delaware<br />\ngame both teams were working<br />\nunder great difficulties. The hot<br />\nweather that had prevailed up to<br />\nthen changed at the beginning of<br />\nthe game to freezing with a wind<br />\nstorm that throughout the game<br />\nmade the ball exceedingly difficult toe ontrol. Owings pitched in<br />\nwonderful form, striking out six<br />\nmen and walking only one. Tucker,<br />\npitching in the ninth, struck out<br />\ntwo of the three batters that came<br />\nup before him. Rich scored Hopkins' first run in the third inning.<br />\nReifschneider, Rich and Owings<br />\nscored in the seventh.

The tickets may be obtained by writing to or appearing<br />\nin person at the athletic office.<br />\nABRAHAM FEDDER'S<br />\nLETTER<br />\nWe publish in our letter column<br />\nof this issue an exceedingly eloquent appeal in behalf of the poor<br />\nstudent. This appeal is well<br />\nworth reading, although there<br />\nseems to be little basis for the<br />\nwriter's complaints. The chief<br />\npurpose of the letter, so far as we<br />\ncan gather, is to urge exemption<br />\nfrom payment of the nonathletic<br />\nfee for those who really cannot afford to pay it. Since the \"well-to:<br />\ndo students\" who, according to the<br />\n<br />\nwriter, thrust this tax upon a misguided student body, at the very<br />\nbeginning provided for the exemption of such students by the Dean,<br />\nthe main point of the letter is at<br />\nonce taken away.<br />\nThe text of the letter, howevor,<br />\nis well worth our perusal. The<br />\nwriter apparently believes that<br />\nthe nonathletic fee is the \"result<br />\nof a vote taken in an illogical moblike fashion.\" We disagree with<br />\nhim. The proposition was printed<br />\nand discussed fully some time in<br />\nadvance (as eprly as last May the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER made the suggestion,<br />\nbut it was unfortunately too late<br />\nto put it into operation, so it was<br />\nnever submitted to a vote by the<br />\nstudent body). It was presented<br />\nin an exceedingly able and logical<br />\nmanner at a student assembly, received the endorsement of various<br />\nleaders in the Atudent body, including that of,the writer of this.<br />\nletter, and was then passed unanimously by the students.<br />\nThe writer also stated that \"in<br />\ninitation of our wise national<br />\nleaders the well-to-do students are<br />\nimposing the share of the expense<br />\nof their peculiar (the italics are<br />\nours) desires upon those who cannot bear them.\" We do not believe<br />\nthat those chiefly influential in<br />\npassing the nonathletic fee can be<br />\nhonestly termed well-to-do, and<br />\nsince the Dean can excuse those<br />\nnot in a position to pay the fee, it<br />\ncannot be said that it is imposed<br />\nupon those who cannot bear it.<br />\nThe fee was inaugurated primarily to give the activities the<br />\nnecessary funds at the beginning<br />\nof the year instead of at the end.<br />\nIt was aimed at the procrastinating student who, while perfectly<br />\nwilling and able to pay, always<br />\nputs off doing so until the last<br />\nminute. If at the same time it<br />\ngets some of the slackers who, although in a position to do so, refuse to support any college activity, so much the better. We are<br />\nheartily glad of it, and feel that<br />\nthe student body as a whole shares<br />\nour delight and is equally desirous<br />\nof seeing this type of student eliminated from the University rolls.<br />\nIn calling the nonathletic fee a<br />\n\"nonessential tax\" and nonathletic<br />\nactivities \"the peculiar desire\" of<br />\nthese men, we believe that the<br />\nwriter displays a misguided opinion. The fee is necessary if these<br />\nactivities are to be placed on a<br />\npar with similar activities in other<br />\neducational institutions. It is also<br />\nnecessary in order that the burden of their support fall equally<br />\nupon all who are able to bear it.<br />\nIf the desire to have our University rank with other leading colleges in undergraduate life is peculiar, the writer is perfectly justified.<br />\nThe writer also complains<br />\nagainst the payment of the NEWSLETTER and other \"noncontracted\"<br />\ndebts from the balance of the students' caution money. We do not<br />\nbelieve that any \"noncontracted\"<br />\ndebts are collected in such a manner. If the writer were acquainted with the law, he would know<br />\n<br />\nthat anyone who receives any publication and does not notify the<br />\nPostoffice authorities that he desires its discontinuance, is legally<br />\nbound to pay for it. The NEWSLETTER and other publications are<br />\nplaced in the student's box in the<br />\nexpectation that he .will pay for<br />\nit as soon as possible, and if he<br />\ndoes not wish it, the time to say<br />\nso is at the beginning of the year,<br />\nand not at the end, when he has<br />\nreceived the use of it throughout<br />\nthat time. Class dues are also<br />\njustly contracted debts, and the<br />\nway to avoid their payment is by<br />\nexcuse from the treasurer, and not<br />\nby ducking at the last minute. Of<br />\ncourse, we realize that some students do not realize that the class,<br />\nmuch less class dues, exist, and<br />\ntherefore such knowledge comes<br />\nas a severe shock. If any other<br />\npayments are collected from the<br />\ncaution money, we feel perfectly<br />\nsure that they are justly contiacted, and therefore are indisputable.<br />\nWe regret the writer's attitude in<br />\nthis matter, and feel sure that it<br />\ndoes not represent fairly the average poor student. In fact, we<br />\nheard some of these men express<br />\nthe opinion that after they have<br />\nsucceeded in getting through the<br />\nyear and met their expenses, they<br />\nare only too glad to do their bit to<br />\nsupport the activities by payment<br />\nof their NEWS-LETTER and other<br />\nbills from their caution money.<br />\nWe have the greatest sympathy<br />\nfor the \"poor searcher for wisdom,\" and have no desire to see<br />\nthis element eliminated from the<br />\nstudent body. We have proved<br />\nthat the nonathletic fee is not<br />\naimed at this class of students<br />\nwhich Fedders so eloquently describes. We have, however, not<br />\nthe slightest feeling of charity for<br />\nthose parasites upon our Alma<br />\nMater who take all from her without giving her the slightest thing<br />\nin return, and if the nonathletic<br />\nfee will in any way eliminate or<br />\nembarrass such students, we are<br />\nheartily thankful.<br />\n<br />\nEcEmm=====zinammalli<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nYe Olde Home Brewe<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe<br />\ntook<br />\nHere's the yell that<br />\nprize in a contest up at Stevens<br />\nTech:<br />\nHorse and wagon,<br />\nHorse and wagon,<br />\nTeam, team, team.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from page I, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\npresident, A.

It was 6.30 and<br />\nalmost dusk when the final whistle<br />\nblew, and Captains Stuart and<br />\nGriffiss decided to call it a day<br />\nafter two hours of hard playing.<br />\nThe playing of the Varsity exceeded the fondest hopes of the<br />\ncoaches, their passing, dodging<br />\n\u2022 and general play against their experienced opponents being excellent for a green team playing<br />\ntheir first game of the season.<br />\nThe Alumni started off with a<br />\n\u2022 rush, and the Varsity goal was in<br />\ndanger from the very first. The<br />\ndefense played steady, however,<br />\nand stopped several strong advances until Baxley shot one past<br />\nBenedict, the ball being sent down<br />\nthe field by beautiful passes from<br />\nSchmeisser to Wolfe to Baxley,<br />\nand the play then started up in<br />\nearnest, LaMotte getting the ball<br />\non the crease and making a pretty<br />\ncorner shot. Griffiss scored first<br />\nfor the Varsity by dodging<br />\nSchmidt and working the ball in<br />\n\u2022 past Stuart for a goal. The play<br />\nwas centered around the Alumni's<br />\ngoal by this time, and it was only<br />\nthrough the wonderful work \u2022 of<br />\nEddie Stuart at goal that the Varsity did not score much more frequently. The Varsity was just<br />\ngetting started, while the Alumni,<br />\nthrough lack of training, were<br />\npretty well fagged when the half<br />\nended with the score 2 to 1 in their<br />\nfavor.<br />\nThe second half started off with<br />\na goal from midfield by Chas.<br />\nWolfe, who played a very fast<br />\ngame at center. The -play was so<br />\nthick around him that he had to<br />\nquit immediately after this as the<br />\n\u2022 result of someone's stock landing<br />\non him, breaking his nose.<br />\n\"Dutch\" Kauffman replaced him<br />\nat center. The Varsity then settled down to work, and two goals<br />\nby Griffiss and one by Bauernschmidt placed them in the lead.<br />\nBauernschmidt's shot was a beautiful .1)iece of stick work.

The<br />\nsteadily increasing cost of printing was the chief obstable.<br />\nThe question of the management<br />\nand distribution of the fund was<br />\ndiscussed at length, but no definite<br />\ndecision was reached. It is probable, however, that the money will<br />\nbe deposited in a lump sum subject to check, and the following<br />\nscheme of distribution be used:<br />\nAll checks must be signed by some<br />\none person, to be selected later,<br />\nwho will keep the books for all activities and will represent the<br />\nFaculty Committee. The checks<br />\nwill, in addition, be countersigned<br />\nby the business manager or some<br />\none designated officer of the activity by whom it is drawn. No bills<br />\nwill be. paid without adequate<br />\nvouchers, and the books will be<br />\nopen to inspection at all times.<br />\nAny additioiltal money procured by \u2022<br />\nan activity will be deposited to the<br />\ncredit of that activity in the general fund, and any surplus at the<br />\nend of the year will be carried<br />\nover to the credit of the organization in the following year.

The first<br />\ninning proved disastrous to Hopkins, very loose playing by the<br />\ninfield giving the Josephites five<br />\nruns, four of which were unearned.<br />\nAfter this the team settled down<br />\nand Ellicott, who pitched a splendid game throughout, had the<br />\ngame in his own hands. Mount<br />\nSt. Josephs only made two scattered hits in the other six innings,<br />\ntheir other run coming from a<br />\npassed ball. The Freshmen got<br />\nto Brehm in the sixth and knocked<br />\nin three runs after two were out.<br />\nHutzler, who took Morovitz's<br />\nplace at first, knocked in two of<br />\nthese runs with a long hit to left<br />\nfield, which only netted him two<br />\nbases, as he slipped rounding first<br />\nbase. Strouse and Donetell played<br />\nwell for the Freshmen, the former<br />\nmaking a one-hand stab at a line<br />\ndrive in the seventh which prevented a run, and the latter making two clean hits in four times<br />\nup. Brehm pitched a steady game<br />\nfor Mount St. Joseph.

Within<br />\nthe last two weeks the team has<br />\nplayed four of its games, winning<br />\none, tying one and losing one (the<br />\nresult of last Saturday's game is<br />\nstill in doubt as we go to press),<br />\nbut in every case showing a quality of playing that has not been<br />\npresent in Black and Blue nines<br />\nfor several years. This quality<br />\nfirst became manifest when the<br />\nteam journeyed to Charlottesville<br />\non March 26 and beat the University of Virginia by the score of<br />\n11 to 5. The result of the Virginia setto came as a decided surprise to most people, especially<br />\nas Hopkins this spring has a team<br />\ncomposed largely of new and hitherto untried men.<br />\nThe game with Delaware on<br />\nMarch 28 resulted in a tie. Both<br />\nteams had made five runs at the<br />\nend of the ninth inning when it<br />\nbecame too dark for further playing.<br />\nThe game scheduled with the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania for<br />\nMarch 31 was called on account<br />\nof rain.<br />\nOn Saturday, April 2, Dartmouth defeated Hopkins at Homewood by getting three runs in the<br />\n*ninth, making the final score 6<br />\nto 3.<br />\nIn the game with Virginia<br />\nTucker pitched until the sixth<br />\ninning, when Marchetti took the<br />\nbox until the finish.<br />\nThe Virginians started off well, bagging<br />\ntwo runs in the first inning,<br />\nwhile Hopkins did not score till<br />\nthe third, when Grace crossed<br />\nthe plate for their initial run of<br />\nthe season. Sexton, of Virginia,<br />\nbrought his team's score up to<br />\nthree runs in the third, at which<br />\ntally it remained until the seventh.<br />\nIt was the fifth that was the lucky<br />\ninning for J. H. U. Hayter,<br />\nSharrets, Wood, Knecht and Reifschneider crossed the plate one<br />\nafter the other. Bill Wood scored<br />\nagain in the sixth, and in the<br />\nseventh and eighth four more runs<br />\nbrought the score to 11 to 5.<br />\nIn the Johns Hopkins-Delaware<br />\ngame both teams were working<br />\nunder great difficulties. The hot<br />\nweather that had prevailed up to<br />\nthen changed at the beginning of<br />\nthe game to freezing with a wind<br />\nstorm that throughout the game<br />\nmade the ball exceedingly difficult toe ontrol. Owings pitched in<br />\nwonderful form, striking out six<br />\nmen and walking only one.

The students are asked to co-operate<br />\nagain this year by bringing the<br />\nproposition to the attention of<br />\ntheir friends and any other people<br />\nwhom they feel might be interested. The tickets may be obtained by writing to or appearing<br />\nin person at the athletic office.<br />\nABRAHAM FEDDER'S<br />\nLETTER<br />\nWe publish in our letter column<br />\nof this issue an exceedingly eloquent appeal in behalf of the poor<br />\nstudent. This appeal is well<br />\nworth reading, although there<br />\nseems to be little basis for the<br />\nwriter's complaints. The chief<br />\npurpose of the letter, so far as we<br />\ncan gather, is to urge exemption<br />\nfrom payment of the nonathletic<br />\nfee for those who really cannot afford to pay it. Since the \"well-to:<br />\ndo students\" who, according to the<br /><br />\nwriter, thrust this tax upon a misguided student body, at the very<br />\nbeginning provided for the exemption of such students by the Dean,<br />\nthe main point of the letter is at<br />\nonce taken away.<br />\nThe text of the letter, howevor,<br />\nis well worth our perusal. The<br />\nwriter apparently believes that<br />\nthe nonathletic fee is the \"result<br />\nof a vote taken in an illogical moblike fashion.\" We disagree with<br />\nhim. The proposition was printed<br />\nand discussed fully some time in<br />\nadvance (as eprly as last May the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER made the suggestion,<br />\nbut it was unfortunately too late<br />\nto put it into operation, so it was<br />\nnever submitted to a vote by the<br />\nstudent body). It was presented<br />\nin an exceedingly able and logical<br />\nmanner at a student assembly, received the endorsement of various<br />\nleaders in the Atudent body, including that of,the writer of this.<br />\nletter, and was then passed unanimously by the students.<br />\nThe writer also stated that \"in<br />\ninitation of our wise national<br />\nleaders the well-to-do students are<br />\nimposing the share of the expense<br />\nof their peculiar (the italics are<br />\nours) desires upon those who cannot bear them.\" We do not believe<br />\nthat those chiefly influential in<br />\npassing the nonathletic fee can be<br />\nhonestly termed well-to-do, and<br />\nsince the Dean can excuse those<br />\nnot in a position to pay the fee, it<br />\ncannot be said that it is imposed<br />\nupon those who cannot bear it.<br />\nThe fee was inaugurated primarily to give the activities the<br />\nnecessary funds at the beginning<br />\nof the year instead of at the end.<br />\nIt was aimed at the procrastinating student who, while perfectly<br />\nwilling and able to pay, always<br />\nputs off doing so until the last<br />\nminute. If at the same time it<br />\ngets some of the slackers who, although in a position to do so, refuse to support any college activity, so much the better. We are<br />\nheartily glad of it, and feel that<br />\nthe student body as a whole shares<br />\nour delight and is equally desirous<br />\nof seeing this type of student eliminated from the University rolls.<br />\nIn calling the nonathletic fee a<br />\n\"nonessential tax\" and nonathletic<br />\nactivities \"the peculiar desire\" of<br />\nthese men, we believe that the<br />\nwriter displays a misguided opinion. The fee is necessary if these<br />\nactivities are to be placed on a<br />\npar with similar activities in other<br />\neducational institutions. It is also<br />\nnecessary in order that the burden of their support fall equally<br />\nupon all who are able to bear it.<br />\nIf the desire to have our University rank with other leading colleges in undergraduate life is peculiar, the writer is perfectly justified.<br />\nThe writer also complains<br />\nagainst the payment of the NEWSLETTER and other \"noncontracted\"<br />\ndebts from the balance of the students' caution money. We do not<br />\nbelieve that any \"noncontracted\"<br />\ndebts are collected in such a manner. If the writer were acquainted with the law, he would know<br /><br />\nthat anyone who receives any publication and does not notify the<br />\nPostoffice authorities that he desires its discontinuance, is legally<br />\nbound to pay for it. The NEWSLETTER and other publications are<br />\nplaced in the student's box in the<br />\nexpectation that he .will pay for<br />\nit as soon as possible, and if he<br />\ndoes not wish it, the time to say<br />\nso is at the beginning of the year,<br />\nand not at the end, when he has<br />\nreceived the use of it throughout<br />\nthat time. Class dues are also<br />\njustly contracted debts, and the<br />\nway to avoid their payment is by<br />\nexcuse from the treasurer, and not<br />\nby ducking at the last minute. Of<br />\ncourse, we realize that some students do not realize that the class,<br />\nmuch less class dues, exist, and<br />\ntherefore such knowledge comes<br />\nas a severe shock. If any other<br />\npayments are collected from the<br />\ncaution money, we feel perfectly<br />\nsure that they are justly contiacted, and therefore are indisputable.<br />\nWe regret the writer's attitude in<br />\nthis matter, and feel sure that it<br />\ndoes not represent fairly the average poor student. In fact, we<br />\nheard some of these men express<br />\nthe opinion that after they have<br />\nsucceeded in getting through the<br />\nyear and met their expenses, they<br />\nare only too glad to do their bit to<br />\nsupport the activities by payment<br />\nof their NEWS-LETTER and other<br />\nbills from their caution money.<br />\nWe have the greatest sympathy<br />\nfor the \"poor searcher for wisdom,\" and have no desire to see<br />\nthis element eliminated from the<br />\nstudent body. We have proved<br />\nthat the nonathletic fee is not<br />\naimed at this class of students<br />\nwhich Fedders so eloquently describes. We have, however, not<br />\nthe slightest feeling of charity for<br />\nthose parasites upon our Alma<br />\nMater who take all from her without giving her the slightest thing<br />\nin return, and if the nonathletic<br />\nfee will in any way eliminate or<br />\nembarrass such students, we are<br />\nheartily thankful.<br /><br />\nEcEmm=====zinammalli<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nYe Olde Home Brewe<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe<br />\ntook<br />\nHere's the yell that<br />\nprize in a contest up at Stevens<br />\nTech:<br />\nHorse and wagon,<br />\nHorse and wagon,<br />\nTeam, team, team.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n(Continued from page I, col. 3)<br /><br />\npresident, A.
