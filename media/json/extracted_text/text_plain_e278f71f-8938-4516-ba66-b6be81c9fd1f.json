Only the completion of examinations was necessary before the body of embryo diplomats 'started to<br />\nformulate tentative agreements. Needless to say, each fraternity<br />\nhas its own special idea and suggestions regarding an ideal rushing<br />\nseason which will be most favorable for its chapter. As a result at<br />\nleast ten different plans are presented to the committee for consideration. Long, tedious, and to a great extent, unnecessary discussions<br />\nand disagreements follow throughout the spring months. A fraternity is always reluctant in wavering its idea of an ideal system, and,<br />\nin some cases, unwilling even to listen to the proposals of other fraternities. Wrong impressions, individual and fraternal malice are<br />\n<br />\nTickets $2.20<br />\n<br />\nThe whole undergraduate department must get the spirit of the<br />\nplayers and permeate this spirit far<br />\nand wide.

This<br />\ndiscussion continues, old minutes of the Interfraternity Board will<br />\nshow, far into the spring. Compromises are made later in order to<br />\nnot so much for the sake of reaching an agreement as to smooth over<br />\nhard feeling or to cover up initial stubbornness. Then, usually about<br />\na week before the cessation of classes, all the fraternities sign an<br />\nagreement.<br />\nThis rather unfortunate circumstance of long discussion and<br />\nthe resulting interfraternity ill-feeling is due to a general lack of coordination among the members of the Interfraternity Board. The<br />\ncause for this appears to be a result of the individual chapters restricting the power of their delegates 'so that the delegate cannot act<br />\nfinally. With the majority of fraternities, the representatives are required to report buck to their chapters every detail before entering<br />\na compromise or taking definite action. Appointment by each fraternity of delegates to the Interfraternity Board capable of drawing up<br />\na rushing agreement and empowered by their respective chapters to<br />\nact on their own initiative, to accept or reject plans at the Board<br />\nmeeting without acting as messenger boys carrying the news from<br />\nthe Board to their chapters, would obviate the long discussions which<br />\nhitherto have characterized the former spring sessions and undoubtedly caused much hard feeling among fraternities. An agreement<br />\nmade in this way would hardly be inferior to the ones of previous<br />\nseasons.<br />\n<br />\nATHLETICALLY DEAD<br />\n<br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nJohns Hopkins' athletic reputation is being lowered by the 192425 season.

Last year's<br />\ncross country team, with Verne<br />\nBooth as its leader, won fame for<br />\nHopkins when Booth won both the<br />\nNational A. A.

Only the completion of examinations was necessary before the body of embryo diplomats 'started to<br />\nformulate tentative agreements. Needless to say, each fraternity<br />\nhas its own special idea and suggestions regarding an ideal rushing<br />\nseason which will be most favorable for its chapter. As a result at<br />\nleast ten different plans are presented to the committee for consideration. Long, tedious, and to a great extent, unnecessary discussions<br />\nand disagreements follow throughout the spring months. A fraternity is always reluctant in wavering its idea of an ideal system, and,<br />\nin some cases, unwilling even to listen to the proposals of other fraternities. Wrong impressions, individual and fraternal malice are<br /><br />\nTickets $2.20<br /><br />\nThe whole undergraduate department must get the spirit of the<br />\nplayers and permeate this spirit far<br />\nand wide.

Compromises are made later in order to<br />\nnot so much for the sake of reaching an agreement as to smooth over<br />\nhard feeling or to cover up initial stubbornness. Then, usually about<br />\na week before the cessation of classes, all the fraternities sign an<br />\nagreement.<br />\nThis rather unfortunate circumstance of long discussion and<br />\nthe resulting interfraternity ill-feeling is due to a general lack of coordination among the members of the Interfraternity Board. The<br />\ncause for this appears to be a result of the individual chapters restricting the power of their delegates 'so that the delegate cannot act<br />\nfinally. With the majority of fraternities, the representatives are required to report buck to their chapters every detail before entering<br />\na compromise or taking definite action. Appointment by each fraternity of delegates to the Interfraternity Board capable of drawing up<br />\na rushing agreement and empowered by their respective chapters to<br />\nact on their own initiative, to accept or reject plans at the Board<br />\nmeeting without acting as messenger boys carrying the news from<br />\nthe Board to their chapters, would obviate the long discussions which<br />\nhitherto have characterized the former spring sessions and undoubtedly caused much hard feeling among fraternities. An agreement<br />\nmade in this way would hardly be inferior to the ones of previous<br />\nseasons.<br /><br />\nATHLETICALLY DEAD<br /><br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nJohns Hopkins' athletic reputation is being lowered by the 192425 season.
