Every encroachment on tenure, even a<br />\nminor one, is seen as a major and impermissable attack on<br />\nthat security. In some ways, perhaps, their fears are<br />\njustified, but to the extent that they are justified, they are<br />\nwrong.<br />\nTenure in its present form is an almost open-ended job<br />\nguarantee. There are some sanctions, such as failure to<br />\ngrant pay increases, that can be applied to \"dead weight\"<br />\nfaculty members. But compared to lawyers, bankers,<br />\nor even doctors, there is extremely little accountability for<br />\nperformance.<br />\nAnd we should ask ourselves, is tenure review really a<br />\nbad thing? The good professors, and there are many on our<br />\nexcellent faculty, would have nothing to fear. And the<br />\nothers...we can do without.<br />\nTenure review, exercised on say a five-year basis,<br />\nwould make tenure itself less of a big deal. The University<br />\nwould grant it more easily, since it would not feel like it<br />\nwas permanently marrying the scholar. It would ease<br />\njunior 'faculty nervousness, because the tenure hump<br />\nwould no longer loom so large. And it would end the kind<br />\nof quasi-cheating which is allowed under the current<br />\nsystem for tenured faculty who exploit their privileged<br />\nposition liberally.<br />\nFor those who will say that academic freedom would<br />\nbe breached, the answer is simple.

Hopkins had a<br />\nchapter of the frat from 1920 to<br />\n1943, but it was disbanded<br />\nbecause of World War II.<br />\nBob Bagdorf, the Vice-President of the new organization,<br />\nsaid the group had formed<br />\nbecause,\"We wanted a small frat<br />\nover whose shape and direction<br />\nwe could have some control.\"<br />\nPresident Bennett Fein added, \"There is a certain sense of<br />\naccomplishment in starting a<br />\nchapter, even if it is only a<br />\nreactivation.\" Fein also saw<br />\nthe founder's freshman status as<br />\nan advantage, since \"We'll all be<br />\naround for three more years to<br />\nbuild the frat.\"<br />\nSean Costello will act as<br />\ntreasurer, while Paul O'Brien is<br />\nPi Lambda's new marshall.<br />\nOnce the founders decided<br />\nto form their own organization,<br />\nthey wrote letters to three<br />\nnational fraternities. They chose<br />\nPi Lambda Phi for three reasons:<br />\nits moderate size, which they<br />\nsaid allows for a high degree of<br />\ncontact between the national<br />\nheadquarters and each chapter,<br />\nas well as among the chapters<br />\nthemselves; its non-sectarian<br />\norigin; and its rule prohibiting<br />\nthe hazing of pledges. The<br />\nfounders said that Pi Lambda's<br />\npledge programs traditionally<br />\nconsist of constructive projects,<br />\nsuch as cleaning the house<br />\nor working in the community.<br />\nThe founders saw Director<br />\n<br />\nof Student Services Tom<br />\nSchmith in order to obtain<br />\nUniversity recognition. They also passed a written tets on the<br />\nfraternity's history, as required<br />\nby the national organization.<br />\nStill in the process of<br />\nfinding a house, the fraternity<br />\nbrothers are already planning<br />\na fundraising event for charity<br />\nsometime next fall .

Class B organizations<br />\nwould be allowed to use the<br />\nUnviersity name and ficilities,<br />\nbut would not receive SAC<br />\nfunding.<br />\nThe new constitution passed<br />\nwith a 13 to 1 vote. SC Secretary Harry Lerner opposed it<br />\nbecause it does not mandate that<br />\nSAC meetings must be open to<br />\nthe student body.<br />\nBefore the constitution as a<br />\nwhole was passed, the Council<br />\nresolved two major controversies. It decided to allow Ellipsis<br />\nto publish graduate students'<br />\nwork and it ruled against allowing SAC groups to sponsor<br />\nteams.<br />\nThe proposed constitution<br />\nstates, \"All SAC publications are<br />\nonly to print the quality material of the undergraduate Homewood community.\" Representatives from thipsis, the SAL-tunded literary review, appeared<br />\nat the SC meeting to protest this<br />\nsentence. Ellipsis currently publishes literary works written by<br />\nundergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and<br />\nalumni. Undergraduates' works<br />\nmake up only 35 to 40% of the<br />\nmaterial printed. The Ellipsis<br />\nstaffers said that if Ellipsis were<br />\nto publish only undergraduates.work, the quality of the publication would deteriorate.<br />\nConnolly contended that if<br />\nundergraduate SAC funds were<br />\nto support Ellipsis, the review<br />\n<br />\nshould print solely the works of<br />\nundergraduates. He said that if<br />\nthe University wishes to have an<br />\nelite literary review, the funds<br />\nshould come from administration or Writing Seminars Department sources.<br />\nSC member Bill Carlson<br />\nfinally resolved the issue by<br />\nmotioning to Ellipsis to publish<br />\nnonundergraduate work for one<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe motion passed 8 to 6,<br />\nwith one abstention.<br />\nThe second point of dissension occurred when Greg Talley,<br />\npresident, of the Sailing Club,<br />\nproposed an addition to the<br />\nconstitution. He suggested that<br />\nSAC organizations be allowed to<br />\nsponsor competetive teams as<br />\nlong as all funds for the teams,<br />\nincluding all insurance costs,<br />\nare raised from sources other<br />\nthan the SAC.<br />\nConnolly argued, \"I don't<br />\nthink we're supposed to be<br />\nfunding teams.\"<br />\nThe Council debated a similar issue last week when the<br />\nDebate Council and Chess Club,<br />\ntwo organizations which wanted<br />\nto sponsor teams, asked for SAC<br />\nsupport. Council members discussed the advisability of giving<br />\nteams money to spend for<br />\ncompetitions which take place<br />\noff-campus and do not benefit<br />\nstudents here who cannot attend<br />\nthe events.

The<br />\nChesapeake Energy Alliance<br />\n(CEA), A Baltimore-based group<br />\nthat supports the immediate<br />\nclosing of all nuclear plants, has<br />\nbenefitted from public concern.<br />\nDuring the two years before the<br />\nThree Mile Island incident, the<br />\nCEA had a core membership of<br />\nAlumni Association President Stanley Blumberg<br />\n<br />\nPlacement Program Set<br />\nBY MIKEFINGERHOOD<br />\nA program which would<br />\nplace Hopkins students in paid<br />\ninternships under the supervision<br />\nof Hopkins alumni was finalized<br />\non Tuesday, April 17, at a<br />\nmeeting between Alumni Association President Stanley Blumberg, Dean Jakie Hall, Director<br />\nof Student Services Tom<br />\nSchmith, Assistant to Dean Hall<br />\nStu Davidson and program or-,<br />\nganizer Sidney Goodfriend.<br />\nStarting in Intersession<br />\n1980, the pilot program will<br />\ntake place in two regions, the<br />\nNew York metropolitan area and<br />\nthe Baltimore-Washington area.<br />\nIf successful, the program will<br />\nexpand to other areas containing<br />\na high density of Hopkins<br />\nstudents, such as Philadelphia,<br />\n_<br />\nAs<br />\n111110111<br />\n<br />\nChicago and Detroit.<br />\nQuestionnaires pertaining to<br />\nthe internships will be mailed to<br />\nalumni in the two pilot areas<br />\nduring the second week of<br />\nAugust. The exact number of<br />\nalumni to be included in the<br />\nmailing is not definite yet. The<br />\nAlumni Association is providing<br />\nhalf the funding for the project,<br />\nwith the other half coming from<br />\nthe Student Council and Administration. The questionnaire,<br />\nwhich will be for Intersession<br />\nand next summer, will require<br />\nthe alumni to fill in such details<br />\nas job description, requirements,<br />\nhours and wages. Responses will<br />\nbe organized and there will be a<br />\nmeeting for the distribution of<br />\nthe jobs to interested students.<br />\nIt will be up to the students to<br />\ninitiate contact with the alumni.<br />\nAccording to Goodfriend,<br />\n<br />\nMINN<br />\n<br />\nMOM<br />\n<br />\nthe administration has been very<br />\nreceptive to the program and<br />\nregards it as worthwhile. He has<br />\n-received a great deal of help<br />\nfrom Director of Academic<br />\nServices Glen Thomas and VicePresident for Institutional Affairs Ross Jones. Goodfriend<br />\nremarked that Stanley Finkel,<br />\nhead of the New York chapter<br />\nof the Alumni Association,<br />\nshowed great interest in the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nHowever, the administration<br />\nhas shown some concern. It is<br />\nslightly apprehensive that there<br />\nmay be more jobs than interested students. For this reason, the<br />\nprogram was made a pilot;if it is<br />\nto be expanded, student support<br />\nmust be demonstrated.

Thousands of people occupied the site<br />\nand physically stopped construction. That protest continues, and the protestors have<br />\nsupplemented sit-ins with legal<br />\ntactics. The Seabrook protest<br />\nresulted in the formation of the<br />\nClamshell Alliance, the first<br />\nof a network of anti-nuclear<br />\norganizations throughout the<br />\nnation.<br />\nPrimarily a community<br />\norganization, half the CEA's<br />\nmembers are college students.<br />\nChristopher, one of the CEA's<br />\ncore members, is a junior at<br />\nTowson State University and<br />\ndescribes the other members as<br />\n\"environmental activists.\" The<br />\ngroup's activities include education about nuclear energy (both<br />\nwithin the CEA and to the<br />\npublic), protests at various<br />\nnuclear sites, the distribution of<br />\nleaflets and support for antinuclear legislation.<br />\nEducation is the group's<br />\nmain focus, according to Christopher. He complained of a lack<br />\nof knowledge even among antinuclear advocates, claiming the<br />\ncity government has impeded<br />\nthe group's efforts to discover<br />\nwhen and where nuclear wastes<br />\nare being trans orted. According<br />\n<br />\nto Christopher, the CEA is<br />\nsupporting a bill to prohibit<br />\nnuclear waste transportation<br />\nthrough Baltimore and needs<br />\nthis information in order to<br />\nmake residents aware of the<br />\nproblem. Christopher said public<br />\nreaction to the CEA's education<br />\nefforts has been \"fair.\" \"Some<br />\npeople are not worried about it,<br />\nfrankly,\" Christopher said. He<br />\nadded that there has not been a<br />\n\"groundswell of spontaneous<br />\noutrage.\" Yet the CEA has<br />\ncontinued to spread its antinuclear message in open forums<br />\nin the Baltimore area which<br />\nfeature panels of anti-nuclear<br />\nexperts.<br />\nThe Three Mile Island incident has alerted some of those<br />\nliving under the shadow of<br />\nnuclear plants to the danger of<br />\nnuclear power. At the Calvert<br />\nCliffs plant (in nearby Calvert<br />\nCounty, Maryland), people are<br />\nbeginning to \"sense that in some<br />\nways, the plant is not safe,\"<br />\nChristopher said. However, the<br />\nBaltimore Gas and Electric<br />\nCompany's propaganda overwhelmed others, he added.<br />\nThe CEA supports the immediate shutting down of all<br />\nnuclear plants because it feels<br />\ncurrent technology is not able to<br />\nbuild them safely. According to<br />\nChristopher, these<br />\nclosings<br />\nwould mean the country would<br />\nhave to rely on coal and oil<br />\nsources and would have to<br />\nadopt a crash program to develop alternate sources of ener .<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Band<br />\nPRESENTS ITS ANNUAL<br />\n<br />\nIn order for the above alumni program<br />\nto take place, student support must be<br />\n<br />\n\u2018<br />\nNkG CON^<br />\n<br />\nshown.

Fashionable as such statements may<br />\ni be, they are quite inaccurate. .<br />\nHopkins students are not totally disinterested.<br />\nRather, they are more like those Americans who are,<br />\nwith good reason, more concerned about the price of<br />\ncorn or their tax bill than about riots in Soweto,for the<br />\nformer immediately affects them whereas the latter do<br />\nnot. Similarly, students are more likely to be concerned<br />\neither about what courses will most improve their grad<br />\nschool prospects, or what band will be at the Rat(hskellar) Saturday night.<br />\nOn the surface, such a pragmatic attitude is quite<br />\ncommendable. Spending an afternoon in the Sci. Ref.<br />\nRoom is likely to be more profitable than attempting to<br />\nchange institutions which will not interest one four years<br />\nhence. Instead of losing sleep over the budget, isn't it<br />\nbetter for most people that they escape the stress<br />\nby going to frat parties or to Disco Night?<br />\nCommendably pragmatic in the short run, yes;<br />\nultimately in each student's interest, no. For most of us,<br />\nthe University experience occurs during that very rough<br />\nand complex transition between youth and adulthood.<br />\nThese four years will probably influence our lives more<br />\nthan any other similar period before or after. The<br />\nintellectual resources on and off campus give us the rare<br />\nopportunity to discover our imperfections and to learn<br />\nabout areas beyond our specialities so that we do not<br />\nbecome mere talking Chemistry books. Thus, intellectual<br />\nexploration and the opportunity to make mistakes<br />\nboth in and out of class can only help our characters,<br />\nand our material futures. It is, then, in our own interest<br />\nto utilize as much of the University as possible. We alone<br />\ncan assert this right, for Garland Hall is, and should be,<br />\nresponsible for its own interests. The classroom, Homewood field, and the disco floor are simply too limited.<br />\nMost of what happens at Homewood is based upon<br />\nthe dynamic of Hopkins-as-a-corporation versus Hopkins-as-an-academic-institution. The principal concern of<br />\nPresident Muller and the central administration is the<br />\nlong term viability of the University as a whole, not just<br />\nHomewood. Because students are usually formally<br />\nassociated with Hopkins during their three to four<br />\nundergraduate years, and because the bulk of the faculty<br />\nis either justly concerned about being promoted or,<br />\nhaving been promoted, are involved in specialized<br />\nscholarship, these two groups (especially the former)<br />\ntend to pay more attention to the short term. The<br />\nDeans, as faculty members who are budget making<br />\nadministrators have a very difficult intermediary role.<br />\nConsequently, it is both natural and necessary that<br />\nthe students and faculty maintain a bureaucratically<br />\nadversary relationship with Garland Hall, and vice versa.<br />\nSkepticism not cynicism, must characterize this tension.<br />\nIf the corporation wins out, then unquantifiable intellectual creativity is likely to be crudely translated into a<br />\nset of manipulable numbers on a balance sheet. In this<br />\nera of tight budgets, then, the academic quality of the<br />\nUniversity might decline solely because of a need to<br />\nbalance the books. On the other hand, if the Administration were to fund every departmental request fort<br />\n<br />\nequipment, faculty or academic programs, the academic<br />\nquality would also decline because Hopkins would<br />\nquickly run out of money and could not meet sudden<br />\nfuture needs.<br />\nIt is at least in the Administration's objective<br />\ninterest, therefore, to have a relatively passive Student<br />\nCouncil and News-Letter, and a quiescent faculty and<br />\nstudent body. Because it is physically impossible and<br />\nbureaucratically unnecessary for the Administration to<br />\nmeet with all the students at once, these two organs are<br />\nboth politically vulnerable to Administration manipulation, since among the students they have near exclusive<br />\naccess to the gnomes of Garland Hall. The Administration can quite efficiently utilize the classic bureaucratic<br />\ntool of alienation: by granting special perks, an official<br />\ncan make a student feel different from his compatriots<br />\nand constituents. Because many student leaders are in<br />\ntheir posts for reasons of ego satisfaction, mere access to<br />\nthe bigwigs is often sufficient. In order for this ego<br />\nmassaging to continue, the student elite often remain<br />\n<br />\nmutual interests, and perpetuates such stereotypes as the<br />\nneurotic pre-med, the automaton Physics major, the<br />\nfluff-headed Humanist, the arrogant Strangelovian<br />\nPoliSci or IR major, or the lacrosse playing disco-nighting Earth and Planetary Sciences student.<br />\nThe Academic Council, which could become an<br />\neffective advocate for faculty interests, has an often<br />\ndeserved reputation for being an Academic conclave that<br />\ntakes the easy way out amidst controversy and which<br />\npays far too little attention to the needs of junior<br />\nfaculty. The result is that more academic power is being<br />\nlodged in the Deans, which is fortunate, at least for now,<br />\nbecause the present group are remarkably competent<br />\nand sensitive, given their difficult intermediary position.<br />\nThis might not be so in the future. More importantly.<br />\nespecially during the budget squeeze, the abdication of<br />\npower by the Academic Council has been gaining more<br />\ncontrol over academic affairs; the dynamic could verY<br />\nwell dissolve, then, in favor of Hopkins-as-corporation.<br />\nStill another condition that inhibits the development of any solid coalition is the adversary relationship<br />\nbetween faculty and students in the classroom. Admission into grad schools and professional schools is getting<br />\ntougher and will continue to, at least 'until the baby<br />\nboom generation graduates. Therefore, students take gut<br />\ncourses to either improve their GPA's, or to be able to<br />\nleave Hopkins after three years. All too many seminars<br />\n<br />\nA moment of glory: In the calendar change, students made a difference.<br />\nneutral towards the Administration, no matter how<br />\nmuch it may hurt the interests of the undergraduates.<br />\nNot through. any deliberate scheme, it is quite possible<br />\nthat certain issues may subtly receive less attention<br />\nat Council meetings or on the front pages, so the students will become less and less aware of their own<br />\ninterests. There has always been a fine line between<br />\npragmatism and appeasement.<br />\nHowever, several factors have prevented the firm<br />\nand permanent establishment of a desirable studentfaculty coalition. The first is that the departments<br />\nthemselves have conflicting interests, which normally do\u2022<br />\nnot reveal themselves except in a crunch, which is what<br />\nwe face now. If grant money dries up in the sciences and<br />\nbecomes still more difficult to obtain in the humanities,<br />\nthen the two may have to compete for University funds.<br />\nMoreover, Hopkins's emphasis on pre-professional<br />\neducation and intensive research often prevents contact<br />\nbetween departments, especially among students. This<br />\nlack of communication hinders any realization of<br />\n<br />\nare less reasoned cooperative inquiries into subject<br />\nmatter than a combination of intellectual show 'n' tell<br />\nand the Gong Show. Students frantically try to prove to<br />\n.o \"Teach\" that they did the week's reading and that<br />\nthey can mouth the arguments faster and more completely than all the other Joes or Melissa-Annes at the table.<br />\nBecause most Hopkins professors are primarily scholars,<br />\nnot teachers, their lack of control of such discussions<br />\nshould not be surprising, nor should any disdain theY<br />\nmay share toward the students, especially if the seminar<br />\nroom or the exam are the only opportunities for contact<br />\nbetween the two. The professor and his syllabus, 10<br />\neffect, become dangerous material obstacles that must<br />\nbe defeated.<br />\nPerhaps the decisive factor which prevents the<br />\ngrowth of any sort of coalition or effective balance ls<br />\nthat the main student political organs are not respected<br />\nby the students. No matter how hard some Council<br />\nmembers try, the Student Council almost begs for<br />\ndisrespect when it debates for half an hour about Its<br />\n<br />\n\fis the<br />\n, the<br />\novian<br />\nijght-<br />\n<br />\nle an<br />\noften<br />\nthat<br />\nvhich<br />\nunior<br />\nbeing<br />\nnow,<br />\netent<br />\nitiofl.<br />\nintly.<br />\npn of<br />\nmore<br />\nvery<br />\nition.<br />\nrelopnship<br />\ndmisAting<br />\nbabY<br />\n:e gut<br />\n)le to<br />\niinars<br />\n<br />\nlbject<br />\ntell<br />\nlye to<br />\nthat<br />\nloettable.<br />\nolars,<br />\n;sions<br />\ntheY<br />\nninat<br />\nntact<br />\nis, in<br />\nmust<br />\n<br />\n; the<br />\nice is<br />\nected<br />\n<br />\ns for<br />\nut it5<br />\n<br />\nnext meeting time or when it declares its \"solidarity\" for<br />\nstriking coal miners. Such clumsy parliamentary gymnastics divert attention from the Council's truly admirable work, which has included the curriculum review,<br />\nthe calendar change victory, and the conduct code.<br />\nBecause the News-Letter is the only University-wide<br />\nnon-Administration disseminator of information, it too<br />\ncan play a more subtle role in influencing campus<br />\npolicies.<br />\nIt is in everyone's interest to have a strong Council<br />\nand a strong News-Letter. By using shrewdly and persistently their guaranteed access to the Administration, the<br />\ntwo organizations can subtly and easily check the<br />\ncorporation's power just by constantly asking questions.<br />\nSomeone is less likely to take what would publicly by<br />\nperceived as a reckless action if there is someone asking<br />\nquestions who will surely discover the act and then<br />\nmake it public knowledge.<br />\nWhat is most ironic is the existence of a vicious<br />\ncircle of student non-participation and lack of confidence in their institutions. If there is little overall<br />\nstudent interest, only a limited number of people with<br />\nselective interests will join the activities. A self-perpetuating student elite will develop, and that group will use<br />\nthe Council and other activities, the News-Letter as well,<br />\nfor its own ends. As a result, students will suspect<br />\nthe groups even more, and there will be an even greater<br />\ndiscrepancy between actual student opinion and apparent student views as expressed through these organ.<br />\nSimilarly, lack of general student interest in the<br />\nUniversity will allow special interest groups that know<br />\nhow to manipulate the Council and the News-Letter to<br />\nbe inordinately powerful. It is true that students do<br />\nseem to approve nearly every referendum originated by<br />\nsuch groups, but this reflects not so much an active<br />\nconstituency for various positions as general passivity.<br />\nIn the past several years, two debates over highly<br />\nemotional issues illustrate the advantages of a student-faculty coalition and the dangers posed by the<br />\nspecial interests. The finest hour for both students<br />\nand faculty was two years ago, during the calendar<br />\nchange dispute. The Administration, for what it deemed<br />\nto be sound budgetary reasons, felt it necessary to<br />\ncoordinate th calendars of each division of the University so that every semester would be the same length,<br />\nwith nearly identical first and last days of classes. For<br />\nHomewood, this would have meant an abolition of<br />\nintersession, and final exams for the fall semester would<br />\nhave been held in January instead of in December.<br />\nStudents would have had to forfeit several weeks of<br />\nvacation (the formal Christmas vacation would have had<br />\nless time for concentrated research, travel, or planning<br />\ntheir courses.<br />\nBoth students and teachers were justifiably furious.<br />\nRepeated negotiations between then Freshman Class<br />\nPresident George Connolly, then Freshman S.C. Representative Gerry Spada and Garland Hall failed. At a<br />\nGeneral Assembly of the faculty, some of the University's most respected professors persistently and very<br />\nbluntly disputed Dr. Muller's arguments in favor of the<br />\ncalendar change. Indeed, it was perhaps the only time<br />\nwhich I have seen the normally adroit University President falter under pressure.<br />\nThe Student Council then shrewdly exploited the<br />\nUniversity's vulnerability to adverse public relations by<br />\nstaging a demonstration outside Shriver Hall on Commemoration Day. Students from all departments marched from the dormitories to Shriver and filled up half the<br />\nlower quad. Trustees, guests and alumni had to walk<br />\nthrough the protestors, a group of whom were marchingmarching in a circle on the Shriver Hall plaza. Young<br />\nTrustees and council members exhorted the students.<br />\nWhen someone spied Dr. Muller daringly walking<br />\ntowards the front entrance of Shriver, cries of \"No<br />\nChange!\" became a half-gleeful, half-angry roar of<br />\n\"We Want Muller.\" The crowd immediately surrounded<br />\nhim. He said, \"If you'd all just shut up, you'd be able to<br />\nhear what I'm trying to say,\" and all was silent. The<br />\nPresment said that he did not have enough time to<br />\ndiscuss the issue with us. The next day, both Sunpapers<br />\ncarried a prominent picture of a righteously scowling<br />\nBruce Smith suspiciously staring at the grimacing President. Needless to say, the Administration relented.<br />\nPerhaps the most disgraceful example of special<br />\ninterest manipulation of the Student Council took place<br />\nearlier that year, when a few students pressured the<br />\nStudent Council to cancel the Weekend Wonderflix<br />\n<br />\nscreening of Ralph Bakshi's coonskin. There were claims<br />\nthat the film offended a significant portion of the<br />\nstudent body, and that it sanctioned racism. Furthermore, because all white students were supposedly either<br />\nstupid or susceptible to racism, the film would supposedly create bigots. (Bakshi contended that Coonskin<br />\nridiculed racism.) After an open forum attended largely<br />\nby the enemies of both the film and the right of students<br />\nto make up their own minds on artistic questions, the<br />\nCouncil submitted. By not attending the forum, students<br />\nabdicated their responsibility to themselves and to the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nBy its action, the Student Council spread a racist<br />\nstereotype, namely, that of the inherently intolerant<br />\nwhite. Moreover, it weakened the traditional concept of<br />\nthe University as a refuge for unpopular ideas. The<br />\nCoonskin affair, just like the Shockley incident at<br />\nHarvard, showed that even the most educated are as<br />\nafraid of different ideas as the most ignorant or parochial.<br />\nBy not being able to witness the interplay of adult<br />\npersonalities, our own emotional growth may be stunted. Indeed, insufficient contact with adults may very<br />\nwell mire us in adolescence.<br />\nHopkins's social life provides the most vivid illustration of this. Of course, the real interaction between the<br />\nsexes and social games take place all the time in the MSE<br />\nLibrary and the Hutzler Reading Room, where a good<br />\nportion of the students grudgingly spend their time each<br />\nday. Disco Night in the Rat or frat parties, the official<br />\nmore conventional variants of social life, are really<br />\nnothing more than exaggerated versions of high school<br />\nparties. Students over or underdress, drink too much to<br />\ngain acceptability, and smoke pot, though there is<br />\nperhaps a bit moke sexuality.<br />\nThe best evidence of the resulting emotional provinciality is that all too many Hopkins males, despite ten<br />\nyears of Women's Lib, still regard women as sex objects.<br />\nIn a competitive school such as JHU, where there are<br />\nmore men than women, females become living signs of<br />\nstatus, to be buffed up and displayed like so many<br />\norganic Cadillacs or Mercedes. Such a situation distorts<br />\ndaily relations between the sexes and engenders mutual<br />\nsuspicion.<br />\nHopkins social life is very political, and women<br />\nbecome almost like small nonaligned states endowed<br />\nwith valuable resources who are thereby courted by the<br />\nGreat Powers. These states survive by manipulation,<br />\nthough they often resent the recurrent Great Power<br />\ncondescension that is passed off as diplomacy.<br />\nThe male search for \"table ornaments\" or bed<br />\npartners begins the first day of orientation. Some<br />\nHopkins women may learn the game once and play it for<br />\nthe sheer ego gratification or to rapidly gain social<br />\ninfluence by coming to know a lot of people very<br />\nquickly. Others probably do not like being treated like<br />\nidiots who understand only baby-talk, instead of normal<br />\nEnglish. In any case, it may very well be necessary to<br />\nadopt an attitude of pragmatic resignation, something to<br />\nthe effect of \"Like it or not, I can't change the fact that<br />\npeople are going to view me solely as a sex object, so I<br />\nmight as well get the most from this psychological<br />\ninvoluntary enslavement.\"<br />\nBut people are not states. States are usually led by<br />\nmature individuals who can rely on the talents and<br />\nexperience of other equally mature people and on the<br />\nnational traditions during times of trauma. Most college<br />\nstudents are not fully adult and, being people, they<br />\ncan ultimately rely .only on themselves during a personal<br />\n<br />\nAdministration<br />\n<br />\ncrisis. That is indeed a shaky basis. Consequently, the<br />\nmanipulations are ever so much more likely to be inept<br />\nor callous. Moreover, the emotions and instincts being<br />\nmanipulated are among the fundamental and mysterious<br />\nelements of the psyche. One cannot coldly toy with<br />\nthem as one would with territorial boundaries or national governments.<br />\nThis is not to say that all men and women at Hopkins exploit each other, nor that the only types of<br />\nmale-female relationships possible are infatuatory.<br />\nRather, the public psychology of this male-dominated<br />\nuniversity encourages such mutual manipulation, and<br />\nespecially at first meeting, hidden or overt mutual<br />\nhostility in expectation of such exploitation. Indeed,<br />\neven the most liberal of us will adopt prejudiced double<br />\nstandards towards the sexes. When someone mentions<br />\nthat he has just met another male, we will ask, \"What's<br />\nhis major?\" If he has met a female, we will ask, \"What<br />\ndoes she look like?\" No one likes to be so degraded, nor<br />\nshould anyone be.<br />\nThe sign above the hallway leading to the Hutzler<br />\nReading Room says, in nearly unreadable gold writing,<br />\n\"Ever the upward urge! For life unfolds its power<br />\nthrough souls who bear aloft the living hopes that spur<br />\nmen on to make new trails and bridge new chasms. Wake<br />\nMen! Arise! Move onward up the slopes!\" Such worth<br />\nseem quaint today; in fact, they bear as much relevance<br />\nto what this University does and should do as do parties,<br />\nexams or lacrosse games. Hopkins must not breed either<br />\nidealistic dilettantes nor seedy, self-centered libertines;<br />\nthis school should try to breed survivors. Such abilities<br />\nare necessary in this incredibly unstable and precarious<br />\nworld, which is still surprisingly tranquil compared to<br />\nthe rest of the planet. One can learn neither to survive<br />\nnor to prosper by either hiding in the library or by<br />\nswilling beer in the Rathskellar. Muddling through is<br />\nokay, but,it is not the stuff of survivors.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12 1 APR4 27, 1979<br />\n<br />\nAn Ex-Shortstop Looks Back<br />\nby Patrick Ercolano<br />\nLike knowing how to swim or roller skate, you<br />\nnever forget the art of fielding a grounder once you've<br />\nlearned it. Scooping ground balls is something you pick<br />\nup at a very green age, and if you wait too long(say, till<br />\nyou're ten or eleven), then you might as well take up<br />\ncoin collecting or the clarinet. I spent four summers in<br />\nthe Idlewylde Little League learning not only how to<br />\nmake a clean pick-up and a good throw, but also how to<br />\nsmack fat pitches served up by chubby grade schoolers.<br />\nThose were four of the most idyllic summers of my<br />\nso-far short life, and when I hung up my Jack Purcells at<br />\nthe ripe old age of thirteen, I felt like Gary Cooper at<br />\nthe end of Pride of the Yankees (except I knew I probably wasn't about to die). Now with the arrival of the<br />\nbaseball season and little kids busying the local diamond,<br />\nI think back on my happy career as a Little Leaguer.<br />\nI am convinced to this day that my first Little<br />\nLeague uniform was made from potato sacks. When I<br />\nfirst tried it on, my little brother said I looked like a<br />\nsail. I didn't really care though, because I had a number<br />\non my back,the word \"Braves\"in script across my shirt,<br />\nand a blue cap with a big \"B\" on the front. There were<br />\nmoments, however, when I feared that a stiff wind<br />\nwould lift me from my shortstop position and send me<br />\nfloating over the left fielder's head. I only weighed about<br />\nsixty pounds at the time.<br />\nPossibly the biggest thrill of my Little League career<br />\ncame during my rookie season when I was in the 8- and<br />\n9-year-old Division. My team was involved in a torrid<br />\npennant race that summer with the Yankees, and toward<br />\nthe end of the season, the two squads met in a crucial<br />\ncontest that would decide the winner of the flag. In the<br />\nfifth inning of the game (Little Leaguers only play seven<br />\ninnings), the score was tied, 7-7. The Braves were up and<br />\nhad the bases loaded when I stepped up to bat. Our<br />\nmanager, a timid little insect exterminator named<br />\nPeebles, put his arm around my shoulder and whispered,<br />\n\"Just wait for your pitch, son. Try to connect. Get some<br />\nwood on it.\" I nodded and winked at him as if to say,<br />\n\"Piece of cake, skip.\" I stalked to the batter's box,<br />\npounded my bat a few times on the plate, fiercely eyed<br />\nthe pitcher, waited for the first delivery, and bunted.<br />\nThe Yankee infielders were quite surprised; after all,<br />\nthey were only 8-year-olds and had never seen a bunt<br />\nbefore in their lives, at least not in person. They watched<br />\nthe ball as it slowly rolled to a dead stop ten feet in<br />\nfront of home. Meanwhile, our runners were scoring and<br />\nI was sailing around the bases. The Yankee catcher<br />\npicked up the ball and in utter panic threw it fifteen<br />\nfeet over the shortstop's head into the outfield. I crossed<br />\nthe plate and was surrounded by my cheering teammates. A bunt grand slam is possible only in the Little<br />\n.1<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.111L<br />\n<br />\nLeague, or nowadays in a game between Oakland and<br />\nToronto. We scored eleven runs that inning and eventually eked out a 37-34 victory.<br />\nMost of my little League managers were bankers or<br />\npharmacists or insurance agents in real life. However, in<br />\nmy third year in the League, I had a manager who<br />\nwas, as near as I could tell, a bum. His name was Mr.<br />\nBurke and he was the scourge of the other managers. He set<br />\na bad example for the kids, they said. He had no job, he<br />\nwas a reputed wife-beater, and he frequently hit the<br />\nbottle. I remember once after a practice, he grabbed his<br />\nassistant, a carbuncular community college student<br />\nnamed Millard, and announced that they were going to a<br />\nlocal department store and buy sheets, and then head for<br />\nJerry's Tavern. Mr. Burke, when he got drunk, liked to<br />\ndress in sheets. I think he had ties with the KKK. In any<br />\ncase, he was a great manager. Because he was usually<br />\nunemployed and had plenty of time to kill, he devoted<br />\nhis life to managing in the Little League. He yelled and<br />\ncursed a lot, and knew almost everything about baseball<br />\nand managing.<br />\n<br />\nThat was the most productive season of my career. I<br />\nwielded a wicked glove and batted .500 throughout the<br />\nseason. In all fairness I must mention that I grew very<br />\nfast that year, so I literally stood head and shoulders<br />\nover most of the other kids. Unfortunately, I stopped<br />\ngrowing soon thereafter. All this reminds me of a game<br />\nthat summer when I had just slid (or, as Dizzy Dean<br />\nused to say, \"slud\")into third base with a triple, and Mr.<br />\nBurke turned to my feeble-hitting teammates and shouted,<br />\n\"Goddam, I wish I had nine Ercolanos on this team!\"<br />\nI stood on the bag, modestly basking in the favor of my<br />\nmanager, but the glory was short-lived. My next time up<br />\nI swung at three pitches and missed them all. As I<br />\nwalked to the bench, my bat dragging behind me, Mr. Burke<br />\nshook his head and snarled, \"Christ, Ercolano, that was pathetic!\" Mr. Burke always prefaced his statements with profanities, but I must say that he never came to a practice<br />\n<br />\n.1111,<br />\n<br />\n\"BEST FOREIGN FILM<br />\nOF THE YEAR\"<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!<br />\n<br />\nACADEMY AWARD WINNER<br />\n<br />\nTeachers College/<br />\nColumbia University<br />\nannounces<br />\nACCEL-A-YEAR\"<br />\nThe first program<br />\nto offer a<br />\nB.S./M.A.<br />\nIN PSYCHOLOGY:<br />\nBEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS<br />\nin 2 years to students who<br />\nhave completed 60 credits<br />\n(B average or better).<br />\n<br />\nBEN17..FAIL'inICY.fe<br />\n<br />\nEXCLUSIVE<br />\nThe Playhouse<br />\n<br />\nWrite today to:<br />\n<br />\nOFCHARLES VILLAGE<br />\n<br />\nACCEL-A-YEAR<br />\n<br />\n25th at Charles\u2022235-0430<br />\n<br />\nWEEKDAYS: 86'10 P.M.<br />\nWEEKENDS: 2, 4,6,8 & 10 P.M.<br />\n.1111.<br />\n<br />\n.11lb<br />\n<br />\n.11<br />\n<br />\n4111<br />\n<br />\n.111.<br />\n<br />\n1111,<br />\n<br />\n'Oh<br />\n<br />\ngib<br />\n<br />\n.1111<br />\n<br />\n.11\u2022<br />\n<br />\ngib<br />\n<br />\nSophomores &<br />\nPsychology Majors!<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Save one year of<br />\ntuition and living<br />\nexpenses<br />\n\u2022Theoretical and<br />\nclinical training<br />\n\u2022Graduate with<br />\nmarketable skills<br />\n\u2022Advanced training<br />\ntoward Ph.

The<br />\nearth floats down from above and we<br />\nreenter the atmosphere in the midst of a<br />\nthunderstorm. The huge screen makes<br />\nthe earth appear truly alone in the void,<br />\nand the viewer can almost touch the<br />\nspectacularly photographed sunlit thunderheads. Mountain ridges pass beneath us<br />\nto suddenly reveal lush valleys that<br />\nappear dizzyingly real. Flying at low<br />\nlevel, we pass over thousands of wild<br />\nbeasts and gazelles charging across the<br />\nSerengeti, while the sound system allows<br />\nus to feel the reverberations of their<br />\nhoofbeats. Sensurround was never quite<br />\nlike this. The vastness and sheer isolation<br />\nof the Sahara desert and the Arctic wastes<br />\nhave never been made so palpable as here<br />\non this giant 50 ft. by 75 ft. screen.<br />\nFor the first time, the camera goes<br />\nunderwater and into schools of fish,<br />\nthen swoops over the Acropolis, the Taj<br />\nMahal, the Cathedral of Chartres and<br />\nNew York City. Finally we see an airliner<br />\nskimmer over many of these same landscapes at sunset as we return once again<br />\nto space.<br />\n<br />\nThe film does have a few flaws. The<br />\nnarration contains too much loftily<br />\nhokey poetry, and the film uses a fish eye<br />\nlense too frequently. In one pass over the<br />\nPacific, the ocean appears to bend downward at a right angle which could almost<br />\nmake one believe the Earth is flat. Furthermore, the big screen does not blend<br />\nitself to photos of waves, trees or people;<br />\ninstead of appearing in 3-D, they simply<br />\nlook like girt images of what one could<br />\nsee at any bijou. The IMAX system is<br />\nmost effective for swooping low over<br />\nwide valleys or plains, and for flying over<br />\nthose mountain ridges that are suddenly<br />\ntransformed into deep chasms. Barry<br />\nLyndon and Days of Heaven would be<br />\nideal for such a system if they could<br />\nadapt themselves to the oversized film<br />\nand wide angle projection lense used to<br />\ncreate the projections magically clear<br />\nresolution and the resultant 3-D effect.<br />\nLiving Planet is tentatively scheduled<br />\nto run for the next month and a half;<br />\nin summer it may be alternated with To<br />\nfly, which had run at Air & Space since<br />\nthe Museum's opening in July, 1976.<br />\nAdult tickets cost fifty cents, but a JHU<br />\nI.D. will admit a student for only twenty-five cents. One should arrive at the<br />\nMuseum as early as possible and plan to<br />\nspend some time there, for now that<br />\nthe weather is nice, the museum is<br />\nespecially crowded. Showings of the film<br />\nare often sold out at least ninety minutes<br />\nbefore they begin. That is no loss, for<br />\nAir & Space has more than enough<br />\ninteresting exhibits to distract even the<br />\nmost bored tourist.<br />\n<br />\n\"Well,I'm A Little Flipped Out!\"<br />\ncont. from p. 14<br />\ndone it.

Every encroachment on tenure, even a<br />\nminor one, is seen as a major and impermissable attack on<br />\nthat security. In some ways, perhaps, their fears are<br />\njustified, but to the extent that they are justified, they are<br />\nwrong.<br />\nTenure in its present form is an almost open-ended job<br />\nguarantee. There are some sanctions, such as failure to<br />\ngrant pay increases, that can be applied to \"dead weight\"<br />\nfaculty members. But compared to lawyers, bankers,<br />\nor even doctors, there is extremely little accountability for<br />\nperformance.<br />\nAnd we should ask ourselves, is tenure review really a<br />\nbad thing? The good professors, and there are many on our<br />\nexcellent faculty, would have nothing to fear. And the<br />\nothers...we can do without.<br />\nTenure review, exercised on say a five-year basis,<br />\nwould make tenure itself less of a big deal. The University<br />\nwould grant it more easily, since it would not feel like it<br />\nwas permanently marrying the scholar. It would ease<br />\njunior 'faculty nervousness, because the tenure hump<br />\nwould no longer loom so large. And it would end the kind<br />\nof quasi-cheating which is allowed under the current<br />\nsystem for tenured faculty who exploit their privileged<br />\nposition liberally.<br />\nFor those who will say that academic freedom would<br />\nbe breached, the answer is simple. A man who has done<br />\ngood work should if released be able to peddle his talents<br />\nelsewhere without any trouble.

Thousands of people occupied the site<br />\nand physically stopped construction. That protest continues, and the protestors have<br />\nsupplemented sit-ins with legal<br />\ntactics.

He complained of a lack<br />\nof knowledge even among antinuclear advocates, claiming the<br />\ncity government has impeded<br />\nthe group's efforts to discover<br />\nwhen and where nuclear wastes<br />\nare being trans orted. According<br /><br />\nto Christopher, the CEA is<br />\nsupporting a bill to prohibit<br />\nnuclear waste transportation<br />\nthrough Baltimore and needs<br />\nthis information in order to<br />\nmake residents aware of the<br />\nproblem.

Fashionable as such statements may<br />\ni be, they are quite inaccurate. .<br />\nHopkins students are not totally disinterested.<br />\nRather, they are more like those Americans who are,<br />\nwith good reason, more concerned about the price of<br />\ncorn or their tax bill than about riots in Soweto,for the<br />\nformer immediately affects them whereas the latter do<br />\nnot. Similarly, students are more likely to be concerned<br />\neither about what courses will most improve their grad<br />\nschool prospects, or what band will be at the Rat(hskellar) Saturday night.<br />\nOn the surface, such a pragmatic attitude is quite<br />\ncommendable. Spending an afternoon in the Sci. Ref.<br />\nRoom is likely to be more profitable than attempting to<br />\nchange institutions which will not interest one four years<br />\nhence. Instead of losing sleep over the budget, isn't it<br />\nbetter for most people that they escape the stress<br />\nby going to frat parties or to Disco Night?<br />\nCommendably pragmatic in the short run, yes;<br />\nultimately in each student's interest, no. For most of us,<br />\nthe University experience occurs during that very rough<br />\nand complex transition between youth and adulthood.<br />\nThese four years will probably influence our lives more<br />\nthan any other similar period before or after. The<br />\nintellectual resources on and off campus give us the rare<br />\nopportunity to discover our imperfections and to learn<br />\nabout areas beyond our specialities so that we do not<br />\nbecome mere talking Chemistry books. Thus, intellectual<br />\nexploration and the opportunity to make mistakes<br />\nboth in and out of class can only help our characters,<br />\nand our material futures. It is, then, in our own interest<br />\nto utilize as much of the University as possible. We alone<br />\ncan assert this right, for Garland Hall is, and should be,<br />\nresponsible for its own interests. The classroom, Homewood field, and the disco floor are simply too limited.<br />\nMost of what happens at Homewood is based upon<br />\nthe dynamic of Hopkins-as-a-corporation versus Hopkins-as-an-academic-institution. The principal concern of<br />\nPresident Muller and the central administration is the<br />\nlong term viability of the University as a whole, not just<br />\nHomewood. Because students are usually formally<br />\nassociated with Hopkins during their three to four<br />\nundergraduate years, and because the bulk of the faculty<br />\nis either justly concerned about being promoted or,<br />\nhaving been promoted, are involved in specialized<br />\nscholarship, these two groups (especially the former)<br />\ntend to pay more attention to the short term. The<br />\nDeans, as faculty members who are budget making<br />\nadministrators have a very difficult intermediary role.<br />\nConsequently, it is both natural and necessary that<br />\nthe students and faculty maintain a bureaucratically<br />\nadversary relationship with Garland Hall, and vice versa.<br />\nSkepticism not cynicism, must characterize this tension.<br />\nIf the corporation wins out, then unquantifiable intellectual creativity is likely to be crudely translated into a<br />\nset of manipulable numbers on a balance sheet. In this<br />\nera of tight budgets, then, the academic quality of the<br />\nUniversity might decline solely because of a need to<br />\nbalance the books. On the other hand, if the Administration were to fund every departmental request fort<br /><br />\nequipment, faculty or academic programs, the academic<br />\nquality would also decline because Hopkins would<br />\nquickly run out of money and could not meet sudden<br />\nfuture needs.<br />\nIt is at least in the Administration's objective<br />\ninterest, therefore, to have a relatively passive Student<br />\nCouncil and News-Letter, and a quiescent faculty and<br />\nstudent body. Because it is physically impossible and<br />\nbureaucratically unnecessary for the Administration to<br />\nmeet with all the students at once, these two organs are<br />\nboth politically vulnerable to Administration manipulation, since among the students they have near exclusive<br />\naccess to the gnomes of Garland Hall. The Administration can quite efficiently utilize the classic bureaucratic<br />\ntool of alienation: by granting special perks, an official<br />\ncan make a student feel different from his compatriots<br />\nand constituents. Because many student leaders are in<br />\ntheir posts for reasons of ego satisfaction, mere access to<br />\nthe bigwigs is often sufficient. In order for this ego<br />\nmassaging to continue, the student elite often remain<br /><br />\nmutual interests, and perpetuates such stereotypes as the<br />\nneurotic pre-med, the automaton Physics major, the<br />\nfluff-headed Humanist, the arrogant Strangelovian<br />\nPoliSci or IR major, or the lacrosse playing disco-nighting Earth and Planetary Sciences student.<br />\nThe Academic Council, which could become an<br />\neffective advocate for faculty interests, has an often<br />\ndeserved reputation for being an Academic conclave that<br />\ntakes the easy way out amidst controversy and which<br />\npays far too little attention to the needs of junior<br />\nfaculty. The result is that more academic power is being<br />\nlodged in the Deans, which is fortunate, at least for now,<br />\nbecause the present group are remarkably competent<br />\nand sensitive, given their difficult intermediary position.<br />\nThis might not be so in the future. More importantly.<br />\nespecially during the budget squeeze, the abdication of<br />\npower by the Academic Council has been gaining more<br />\ncontrol over academic affairs; the dynamic could verY<br />\nwell dissolve, then, in favor of Hopkins-as-corporation.<br />\nStill another condition that inhibits the development of any solid coalition is the adversary relationship<br />\nbetween faculty and students in the classroom. Admission into grad schools and professional schools is getting<br />\ntougher and will continue to, at least 'until the baby<br />\nboom generation graduates. Therefore, students take gut<br />\ncourses to either improve their GPA's, or to be able to<br />\nleave Hopkins after three years. All too many seminars<br /><br />\nA moment of glory: In the calendar change, students made a difference.<br />\nneutral towards the Administration, no matter how<br />\nmuch it may hurt the interests of the undergraduates.<br />\nNot through. any deliberate scheme, it is quite possible<br />\nthat certain issues may subtly receive less attention<br />\nat Council meetings or on the front pages, so the students will become less and less aware of their own<br />\ninterests. There has always been a fine line between<br />\npragmatism and appeasement.<br />\nHowever, several factors have prevented the firm<br />\nand permanent establishment of a desirable studentfaculty coalition. The first is that the departments<br />\nthemselves have conflicting interests, which normally do\u2022<br />\nnot reveal themselves except in a crunch, which is what<br />\nwe face now. If grant money dries up in the sciences and<br />\nbecomes still more difficult to obtain in the humanities,<br />\nthen the two may have to compete for University funds.<br />\nMoreover, Hopkins's emphasis on pre-professional<br />\neducation and intensive research often prevents contact<br />\nbetween departments, especially among students. This<br />\nlack of communication hinders any realization of<br /><br />\nare less reasoned cooperative inquiries into subject<br />\nmatter than a combination of intellectual show 'n' tell<br />\nand the Gong Show. Students frantically try to prove to<br />\n.o \"Teach\" that they did the week's reading and that<br />\nthey can mouth the arguments faster and more completely than all the other Joes or Melissa-Annes at the table.<br />\nBecause most Hopkins professors are primarily scholars,<br />\nnot teachers, their lack of control of such discussions<br />\nshould not be surprising, nor should any disdain theY<br />\nmay share toward the students, especially if the seminar<br />\nroom or the exam are the only opportunities for contact<br />\nbetween the two. The professor and his syllabus, 10<br />\neffect, become dangerous material obstacles that must<br />\nbe defeated.<br />\nPerhaps the decisive factor which prevents the<br />\ngrowth of any sort of coalition or effective balance ls<br />\nthat the main student political organs are not respected<br />\nby the students. No matter how hard some Council<br />\nmembers try, the Student Council almost begs for<br />\ndisrespect when it debates for half an hour about Its<br /><br />\nis the<br />\n, the<br />\novian<br />\nijght-<br /><br />\nle an<br />\noften<br />\nthat<br />\nvhich<br />\nunior<br />\nbeing<br />\nnow,<br />\netent<br />\nitiofl.<br />\nintly.<br />\npn of<br />\nmore<br />\nvery<br />\nition.<br />\nrelopnship<br />\ndmisAting<br />\nbabY<br />\n:e gut<br />\n)le to<br />\niinars<br /><br />\nlbject<br />\ntell<br />\nlye to<br />\nthat<br />\nloettable.<br />\nolars,<br />\n;sions<br />\ntheY<br />\nninat<br />\nntact<br />\nis, in<br />\nmust<br /><br />\n; the<br />\nice is<br />\nected<br /><br />\ns for<br />\nut it5<br /><br />\nnext meeting time or when it declares its \"solidarity\" for<br />\nstriking coal miners. Such clumsy parliamentary gymnastics divert attention from the Council's truly admirable work, which has included the curriculum review,<br />\nthe calendar change victory, and the conduct code.<br />\nBecause the News-Letter is the only University-wide<br />\nnon-Administration disseminator of information, it too<br />\ncan play a more subtle role in influencing campus<br />\npolicies.<br />\nIt is in everyone's interest to have a strong Council<br />\nand a strong News-Letter. By using shrewdly and persistently their guaranteed access to the Administration, the<br />\ntwo organizations can subtly and easily check the<br />\ncorporation's power just by constantly asking questions.<br />\nSomeone is less likely to take what would publicly by<br />\nperceived as a reckless action if there is someone asking<br />\nquestions who will surely discover the act and then<br />\nmake it public knowledge.<br />\nWhat is most ironic is the existence of a vicious<br />\ncircle of student non-participation and lack of confidence in their institutions. If there is little overall<br />\nstudent interest, only a limited number of people with<br />\nselective interests will join the activities. A self-perpetuating student elite will develop, and that group will use<br />\nthe Council and other activities, the News-Letter as well,<br />\nfor its own ends. As a result, students will suspect<br />\nthe groups even more, and there will be an even greater<br />\ndiscrepancy between actual student opinion and apparent student views as expressed through these organ.<br />\nSimilarly, lack of general student interest in the<br />\nUniversity will allow special interest groups that know<br />\nhow to manipulate the Council and the News-Letter to<br />\nbe inordinately powerful. It is true that students do<br />\nseem to approve nearly every referendum originated by<br />\nsuch groups, but this reflects not so much an active<br />\nconstituency for various positions as general passivity.<br />\nIn the past several years, two debates over highly<br />\nemotional issues illustrate the advantages of a student-faculty coalition and the dangers posed by the<br />\nspecial interests. The finest hour for both students<br />\nand faculty was two years ago, during the calendar<br />\nchange dispute. The Administration, for what it deemed<br />\nto be sound budgetary reasons, felt it necessary to<br />\ncoordinate th calendars of each division of the University so that every semester would be the same length,<br />\nwith nearly identical first and last days of classes. For<br />\nHomewood, this would have meant an abolition of<br />\nintersession, and final exams for the fall semester would<br />\nhave been held in January instead of in December.<br />\nStudents would have had to forfeit several weeks of<br />\nvacation (the formal Christmas vacation would have had<br />\nless time for concentrated research, travel, or planning<br />\ntheir courses.<br />\nBoth students and teachers were justifiably furious.<br />\nRepeated negotiations between then Freshman Class<br />\nPresident George Connolly, then Freshman S.C. Representative Gerry Spada and Garland Hall failed. At a<br />\nGeneral Assembly of the faculty, some of the University's most respected professors persistently and very<br />\nbluntly disputed Dr. Muller's arguments in favor of the<br />\ncalendar change. Indeed, it was perhaps the only time<br />\nwhich I have seen the normally adroit University President falter under pressure.<br />\nThe Student Council then shrewdly exploited the<br />\nUniversity's vulnerability to adverse public relations by<br />\nstaging a demonstration outside Shriver Hall on Commemoration Day. Students from all departments marched from the dormitories to Shriver and filled up half the<br />\nlower quad. Trustees, guests and alumni had to walk<br />\nthrough the protestors, a group of whom were marchingmarching in a circle on the Shriver Hall plaza. Young<br />\nTrustees and council members exhorted the students.<br />\nWhen someone spied Dr. Muller daringly walking<br />\ntowards the front entrance of Shriver, cries of \"No<br />\nChange!\" became a half-gleeful, half-angry roar of<br />\n\"We Want Muller.\" The crowd immediately surrounded<br />\nhim. He said, \"If you'd all just shut up, you'd be able to<br />\nhear what I'm trying to say,\" and all was silent. The<br />\nPresment said that he did not have enough time to<br />\ndiscuss the issue with us. The next day, both Sunpapers<br />\ncarried a prominent picture of a righteously scowling<br />\nBruce Smith suspiciously staring at the grimacing President. Needless to say, the Administration relented.<br />\nPerhaps the most disgraceful example of special<br />\ninterest manipulation of the Student Council took place<br />\nearlier that year, when a few students pressured the<br />\nStudent Council to cancel the Weekend Wonderflix<br /><br />\nscreening of Ralph Bakshi's coonskin. There were claims<br />\nthat the film offended a significant portion of the<br />\nstudent body, and that it sanctioned racism. Furthermore, because all white students were supposedly either<br />\nstupid or susceptible to racism, the film would supposedly create bigots. (Bakshi contended that Coonskin<br />\nridiculed racism.) After an open forum attended largely<br />\nby the enemies of both the film and the right of students<br />\nto make up their own minds on artistic questions, the<br />\nCouncil submitted. By not attending the forum, students<br />\nabdicated their responsibility to themselves and to the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nBy its action, the Student Council spread a racist<br />\nstereotype, namely, that of the inherently intolerant<br />\nwhite. Moreover, it weakened the traditional concept of<br />\nthe University as a refuge for unpopular ideas. The<br />\nCoonskin affair, just like the Shockley incident at<br />\nHarvard, showed that even the most educated are as<br />\nafraid of different ideas as the most ignorant or parochial.<br />\nBy not being able to witness the interplay of adult<br />\npersonalities, our own emotional growth may be stunted. Indeed, insufficient contact with adults may very<br />\nwell mire us in adolescence.<br />\nHopkins's social life provides the most vivid illustration of this. Of course, the real interaction between the<br />\nsexes and social games take place all the time in the MSE<br />\nLibrary and the Hutzler Reading Room, where a good<br />\nportion of the students grudgingly spend their time each<br />\nday. Disco Night in the Rat or frat parties, the official<br />\nmore conventional variants of social life, are really<br />\nnothing more than exaggerated versions of high school<br />\nparties. Students over or underdress, drink too much to<br />\ngain acceptability, and smoke pot, though there is<br />\nperhaps a bit moke sexuality.<br />\nThe best evidence of the resulting emotional provinciality is that all too many Hopkins males, despite ten<br />\nyears of Women's Lib, still regard women as sex objects.<br />\nIn a competitive school such as JHU, where there are<br />\nmore men than women, females become living signs of<br />\nstatus, to be buffed up and displayed like so many<br />\norganic Cadillacs or Mercedes. Such a situation distorts<br />\ndaily relations between the sexes and engenders mutual<br />\nsuspicion.<br />\nHopkins social life is very political, and women<br />\nbecome almost like small nonaligned states endowed<br />\nwith valuable resources who are thereby courted by the<br />\nGreat Powers. These states survive by manipulation,<br />\nthough they often resent the recurrent Great Power<br />\ncondescension that is passed off as diplomacy.<br />\nThe male search for \"table ornaments\" or bed<br />\npartners begins the first day of orientation. Some<br />\nHopkins women may learn the game once and play it for<br />\nthe sheer ego gratification or to rapidly gain social<br />\ninfluence by coming to know a lot of people very<br />\nquickly. Others probably do not like being treated like<br />\nidiots who understand only baby-talk, instead of normal<br />\nEnglish. In any case, it may very well be necessary to<br />\nadopt an attitude of pragmatic resignation, something to<br />\nthe effect of \"Like it or not, I can't change the fact that<br />\npeople are going to view me solely as a sex object, so I<br />\nmight as well get the most from this psychological<br />\ninvoluntary enslavement.\"<br />\nBut people are not states. States are usually led by<br />\nmature individuals who can rely on the talents and<br />\nexperience of other equally mature people and on the<br />\nnational traditions during times of trauma. Most college<br />\nstudents are not fully adult and, being people, they<br />\ncan ultimately rely .only on themselves during a personal<br /><br />\nAdministration<br /><br />\ncrisis. That is indeed a shaky basis. Consequently, the<br />\nmanipulations are ever so much more likely to be inept<br />\nor callous. Moreover, the emotions and instincts being<br />\nmanipulated are among the fundamental and mysterious<br />\nelements of the psyche. One cannot coldly toy with<br />\nthem as one would with territorial boundaries or national governments.<br />\nThis is not to say that all men and women at Hopkins exploit each other, nor that the only types of<br />\nmale-female relationships possible are infatuatory.<br />\nRather, the public psychology of this male-dominated<br />\nuniversity encourages such mutual manipulation, and<br />\nespecially at first meeting, hidden or overt mutual<br />\nhostility in expectation of such exploitation. Indeed,<br />\neven the most liberal of us will adopt prejudiced double<br />\nstandards towards the sexes. When someone mentions<br />\nthat he has just met another male, we will ask, \"What's<br />\nhis major?\" If he has met a female, we will ask, \"What<br />\ndoes she look like?\" No one likes to be so degraded, nor<br />\nshould anyone be.<br />\nThe sign above the hallway leading to the Hutzler<br />\nReading Room says, in nearly unreadable gold writing,<br />\n\"Ever the upward urge! For life unfolds its power<br />\nthrough souls who bear aloft the living hopes that spur<br />\nmen on to make new trails and bridge new chasms. Wake<br />\nMen! Arise! Move onward up the slopes!\" Such worth<br />\nseem quaint today; in fact, they bear as much relevance<br />\nto what this University does and should do as do parties,<br />\nexams or lacrosse games. Hopkins must not breed either<br />\nidealistic dilettantes nor seedy, self-centered libertines;<br />\nthis school should try to breed survivors. Such abilities<br />\nare necessary in this incredibly unstable and precarious<br />\nworld, which is still surprisingly tranquil compared to<br />\nthe rest of the planet. One can learn neither to survive<br />\nnor to prosper by either hiding in the library or by<br />\nswilling beer in the Rathskellar. Muddling through is<br />\nokay, but,it is not the stuff of survivors.<br /><br />\nPAGE 12 1 APR4 27, 1979<br /><br />\nAn Ex-Shortstop Looks Back<br />\nby Patrick Ercolano<br />\nLike knowing how to swim or roller skate, you<br />\nnever forget the art of fielding a grounder once you've<br />\nlearned it. Scooping ground balls is something you pick<br />\nup at a very green age, and if you wait too long(say, till<br />\nyou're ten or eleven), then you might as well take up<br />\ncoin collecting or the clarinet. I spent four summers in<br />\nthe Idlewylde Little League learning not only how to<br />\nmake a clean pick-up and a good throw, but also how to<br />\nsmack fat pitches served up by chubby grade schoolers.<br />\nThose were four of the most idyllic summers of my<br />\nso-far short life, and when I hung up my Jack Purcells at<br />\nthe ripe old age of thirteen, I felt like Gary Cooper at<br />\nthe end of Pride of the Yankees (except I knew I probably wasn't about to die). Now with the arrival of the<br />\nbaseball season and little kids busying the local diamond,<br />\nI think back on my happy career as a Little Leaguer.<br />\nI am convinced to this day that my first Little<br />\nLeague uniform was made from potato sacks. When I<br />\nfirst tried it on, my little brother said I looked like a<br />\nsail. I didn't really care though, because I had a number<br />\non my back,the word \"Braves\"in script across my shirt,<br />\nand a blue cap with a big \"B\" on the front. There were<br />\nmoments, however, when I feared that a stiff wind<br />\nwould lift me from my shortstop position and send me<br />\nfloating over the left fielder's head. I only weighed about<br />\nsixty pounds at the time.<br />\nPossibly the biggest thrill of my Little League career<br />\ncame during my rookie season when I was in the 8- and<br />\n9-year-old Division. My team was involved in a torrid<br />\npennant race that summer with the Yankees, and toward<br />\nthe end of the season, the two squads met in a crucial<br />\ncontest that would decide the winner of the flag. In the<br />\nfifth inning of the game (Little Leaguers only play seven<br />\ninnings), the score was tied, 7-7. The Braves were up and<br />\nhad the bases loaded when I stepped up to bat. Our<br />\nmanager, a timid little insect exterminator named<br />\nPeebles, put his arm around my shoulder and whispered,<br />\n\"Just wait for your pitch, son. Try to connect. Get some<br />\nwood on it.\" I nodded and winked at him as if to say,<br />\n\"Piece of cake, skip.\" I stalked to the batter's box,<br />\npounded my bat a few times on the plate, fiercely eyed<br />\nthe pitcher, waited for the first delivery, and bunted.<br />\nThe Yankee infielders were quite surprised; after all,<br />\nthey were only 8-year-olds and had never seen a bunt<br />\nbefore in their lives, at least not in person. They watched<br />\nthe ball as it slowly rolled to a dead stop ten feet in<br />\nfront of home. Meanwhile, our runners were scoring and<br />\nI was sailing around the bases. The Yankee catcher<br />\npicked up the ball and in utter panic threw it fifteen<br />\nfeet over the shortstop's head into the outfield. I crossed<br />\nthe plate and was surrounded by my cheering teammates. A bunt grand slam is possible only in the Little<br />\n.1<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n.\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n.111L<br /><br />\nLeague, or nowadays in a game between Oakland and<br />\nToronto. We scored eleven runs that inning and eventually eked out a 37-34 victory.<br />\nMost of my little League managers were bankers or<br />\npharmacists or insurance agents in real life. However, in<br />\nmy third year in the League, I had a manager who<br />\nwas, as near as I could tell, a bum. His name was Mr.<br />\nBurke and he was the scourge of the other managers. He set<br />\na bad example for the kids, they said. He had no job, he<br />\nwas a reputed wife-beater, and he frequently hit the<br />\nbottle. I remember once after a practice, he grabbed his<br />\nassistant, a carbuncular community college student<br />\nnamed Millard, and announced that they were going to a<br />\nlocal department store and buy sheets, and then head for<br />\nJerry's Tavern. Mr. Burke, when he got drunk, liked to<br />\ndress in sheets. I think he had ties with the KKK. In any<br />\ncase, he was a great manager. Because he was usually<br />\nunemployed and had plenty of time to kill, he devoted<br />\nhis life to managing in the Little League. He yelled and<br />\ncursed a lot, and knew almost everything about baseball<br />\nand managing.<br /><br />\nThat was the most productive season of my career. I<br />\nwielded a wicked glove and batted .500 throughout the<br />\nseason. In all fairness I must mention that I grew very<br />\nfast that year, so I literally stood head and shoulders<br />\nover most of the other kids. Unfortunately, I stopped<br />\ngrowing soon thereafter. All this reminds me of a game<br />\nthat summer when I had just slid (or, as Dizzy Dean<br />\nused to say, \"slud\")into third base with a triple, and Mr.<br />\nBurke turned to my feeble-hitting teammates and shouted,<br />\n\"Goddam, I wish I had nine Ercolanos on this team!\"<br />\nI stood on the bag, modestly basking in the favor of my<br />\nmanager, but the glory was short-lived. My next time up<br />\nI swung at three pitches and missed them all. As I<br />\nwalked to the bench, my bat dragging behind me, Mr. Burke<br />\nshook his head and snarled, \"Christ, Ercolano, that was pathetic!\" Mr. Burke always prefaced his statements with profanities, but I must say that he never came to a practice<br /><br />\n.1111,<br /><br />\n\"BEST FOREIGN FILM<br />\nOF THE YEAR\"<br /><br />\nATTENTION!<br /><br />\nACADEMY AWARD WINNER<br /><br />\nTeachers College/<br />\nColumbia University<br />\nannounces<br />\nACCEL-A-YEAR\"<br />\nThe first program<br />\nto offer a<br />\nB.S./M.A.<br />\nIN PSYCHOLOGY:<br />\nBEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS<br />\nin 2 years to students who<br />\nhave completed 60 credits<br />\n(B average or better).<br /><br />\nBEN17..FAIL'inICY.fe<br /><br />\nEXCLUSIVE<br />\nThe Playhouse<br /><br />\nWrite today to:<br /><br />\nOFCHARLES VILLAGE<br /><br />\nACCEL-A-YEAR<br /><br />\n25th at Charles\u2022235-0430<br /><br />\nWEEKDAYS: 86'10 P.M.<br />\nWEEKENDS: 2, 4,6,8 &amp; 10 P.M.<br />\n.1111.<br /><br />\n.11lb<br /><br />\n.11<br /><br />\n4111<br /><br />\n.111.<br /><br />\n1111,<br /><br />\n'Oh<br /><br />\ngib<br /><br />\n.1111<br /><br />\n.11\u2022<br /><br />\ngib<br /><br />\nSophomores &amp;<br />\nPsychology Majors!<br /><br />\n\u2022Save one year of<br />\ntuition and living<br />\nexpenses<br />\n\u2022Theoretical and<br />\nclinical training<br />\n\u2022Graduate with<br />\nmarketable skills<br />\n\u2022Advanced training<br />\ntoward Ph.

The<br />\nearth floats down from above and we<br />\nreenter the atmosphere in the midst of a<br />\nthunderstorm. The huge screen makes<br />\nthe earth appear truly alone in the void,<br />\nand the viewer can almost touch the<br />\nspectacularly photographed sunlit thunderheads. Mountain ridges pass beneath us<br />\nto suddenly reveal lush valleys that<br />\nappear dizzyingly real. Flying at low<br />\nlevel, we pass over thousands of wild<br />\nbeasts and gazelles charging across the<br />\nSerengeti, while the sound system allows<br />\nus to feel the reverberations of their<br />\nhoofbeats. Sensurround was never quite<br />\nlike this. The vastness and sheer isolation<br />\nof the Sahara desert and the Arctic wastes<br />\nhave never been made so palpable as here<br />\non this giant 50 ft. by 75 ft. screen.<br />\nFor the first time, the camera goes<br />\nunderwater and into schools of fish,<br />\nthen swoops over the Acropolis, the Taj<br />\nMahal, the Cathedral of Chartres and<br />\nNew York City. Finally we see an airliner<br />\nskimmer over many of these same landscapes at sunset as we return once again<br />\nto space.<br /><br />\nThe film does have a few flaws. The<br />\nnarration contains too much loftily<br />\nhokey poetry, and the film uses a fish eye<br />\nlense too frequently. In one pass over the<br />\nPacific, the ocean appears to bend downward at a right angle which could almost<br />\nmake one believe the Earth is flat. Furthermore, the big screen does not blend<br />\nitself to photos of waves, trees or people;<br />\ninstead of appearing in 3-D, they simply<br />\nlook like girt images of what one could<br />\nsee at any bijou. The IMAX system is<br />\nmost effective for swooping low over<br />\nwide valleys or plains, and for flying over<br />\nthose mountain ridges that are suddenly<br />\ntransformed into deep chasms. Barry<br />\nLyndon and Days of Heaven would be<br />\nideal for such a system if they could<br />\nadapt themselves to the oversized film<br />\nand wide angle projection lense used to<br />\ncreate the projections magically clear<br />\nresolution and the resultant 3-D effect.<br />\nLiving Planet is tentatively scheduled<br />\nto run for the next month and a half;<br />\nin summer it may be alternated with To<br />\nfly, which had run at Air &amp; Space since<br />\nthe Museum's opening in July, 1976.<br />\nAdult tickets cost fifty cents, but a JHU<br />\nI.D. will admit a student for only twenty-five cents.

Showings of the film<br />\nare often sold out at least ninety minutes<br />\nbefore they begin.

Army then popped<br />\nin three quick goals to bring the<br />\nUndaunted,<br />\nscore to. 11-6.<br />\nattackman Jeff Blomquist took<br />\nthe ball in from the midfield line<br />\nfollowing an Army goal and<br />\nlofted in Hopkins' final goal<br />\nbehind the back of MacGibbon,<br />\nwho was out of the crease.<br />\nThe most obvious feature of<br />\nthe Blue Jays' play to date has<br />\nbeen their slowness out of the<br />\nstarting blocks.
