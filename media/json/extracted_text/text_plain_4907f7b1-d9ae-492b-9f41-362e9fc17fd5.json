The Neanderthal<br />\nMan, the \"cave man's\" prot,optype, stood erect, and was intelligent as modern man. Nor did his<br />\nknuckles scrape the earth, according to anthropology Professor William L. Straus, Jr.<br />\n<br />\nAfter nearly a full semester of cogitation, the NewsLetter has arrived at an educational policy which will<br />\nsolve nearly all significant university and college problems. We humbly present this master concept, which we<br />\ncall the Truly New Plan, in the following paragraphs.<br />\nDr. Straus gave thorough exThe Truly New Plan hinges upon the fact that a col- amination to fossil remains of<br />\nlege degree is necessary to obtain a monetarily satisfactory the \"old Man of La Chapejleaux-Saints,\" a singularly signifand sufficiently secure employment.

Therefore the Truly commonly accepted concept of<br />\nNew Plan has incorporated a unique factor\u2014the ability Neanderthal's posture would<br />\nhave been a ph.ysical impossibilto get a college degree by proxy.<br />\nUnder our plan, the student in the above category<br />\n-would pay tuition to the university and would pay a university-approved group of students to take the exams for<br />\ncourses prerequisite for the degree, after the _candidate<br />\nhad passed certain preliminary intelligence and aptitude<br />\ntests. The total cost would equal the cost of going through<br />\nthe University as a normally enrolled student, or, for example, at the Hopkins roughly $8,000. The grades would<br />\nnot be permitted to rise above a Gentleman's C. They<br />\nwould not be allowed to drop below a D, because of the<br />\nUniversity backing and the amount of money involved.<br />\nAfter four years, the proxy candidate would receive his<br />\ndegree at a graduation exercise, and would be allowed to<br />\nwear a black robe and mortar board.<br />\nDuring the intermittant four years, the proxy candidate would be required to enter the field of his choice, as<br />\nan uneducated but salaried employee. He would thus<br />\nacquire the necessary techniques and would have a sizeable financial margin, even after paying the bill for his<br />\ndegree. Because of his relative isolation, he would be<br />\nsubjected ,to a minimum of disturbing ideas. He would,<br />\nindeed, be better suited to the increasingly popular\" Moretypical-than-thou\" attitude which is slowly filtering<br />\nthrough the Appalachians.<br />\nThe Truly New Plan would secondly ward off the<br />\nimpending threat of tremendous overcrowding resulting<br />\nfrom a more college age population which has more,than<br />\ndoubled in the last two decades. The money which would<br />\nhave been needed to expand facilities could instead be used<br />\nto improve them.<br />\nFinances would no longer be a problem for colleges<br />\nand universities. The probable large proportion of proxy<br />\ncandidates could provide more than surplus funds, since<br />\nthe price of the vellum for the diplomas would be the only<br />\nexpenditure. At Hopkins, for instance, the cost would be<br />\napproximately fifty cents, and the profit would be $3999.50,<br />\nper capita. This would be enough to pay all university expenses and still have enough left over to send athletic<br />\nteams as fiAr as Madagascar at the slightest whim.<br />\nSerious students would find a paradise on earth under<br />\nthe Truly New Plan. They would not be restrained by the<br />\npresence of degree-seekers. School facilities would be<br />\noptimal due to the surplus wealth. The improved quality<br />\nof student would lure the faculty into the long-awaited<br />\npersonal tutelage. Finally about $5000 per proxy would go<br />\nto the students taking his tests. All the fruly brilliant students in the nation could thus be given a superb education;<br />\nthe mediocre ones would reach their inevitable positions<br />\nas technicians, without suffering undue hardships or acquiring inferiority complexes, as they now do.<br />\nThe recent death of- Bill Bain is one of the most<br />\ntragic events in our memory.

Congenitally bent knees<br />\nwould mean that Neanderthal<br />\nwould have fallen on his receding<br />\nchin after attempting to take his<br />\nfirst step.<br />\n--MITCHELL<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\nNot Bowlegged<br />\nContinuing his exoneration of<br />\nNeanderthal Man, Dr. Straus<br />\nproduced a slightly curved leg<br />\nbone, which originally supported<br />\na less arthritic Neanderthal. He<br />\nstated that from bones such as<br />\nthis, extreme bowleggedness had<br />\nbeen ascribed to Neanderthal,<br />\nfurther compounding his ambulatory woes. However, he said, the<br />\ndeformity hal been greatly overemphasized. \"Plenty of people<br />\nhave femurs as curved as this<br />\none, for instance, those who do a<br />\nlot of riding. I'll bet the majority<br />\nof the Texas cowboys had femurs<br />\nas curved as this.<br />\n\"His arms were relatively<br />\nshorter than modern man's,\" he<br />\ncontinued, differing with the usual conception. \"There's no evi-<br />\n<br />\nGross Misrepresentation<br />\ndence that his brain wasn't as<br />\ngood as modern man's.

While we do not profess to have the court experience of this coach, we feel that this statement must be<br />\nqualified in some respect.<br />\nWe believe that the schools in the M-D loop lack<br />\ntall cagers so prominent in the small college fives of the<br />\nmid-west and upper New York. This does not necessarily<br />\nhurt the quality of the game, for in many circles the<br />\n\"goons\" of the court are being soundly criticized. However, it is mentioned only to show that the M-D schools do<br />\nlack a very necessary ingredient that prevents them from<br />\nbeing classed with the top flight small cage schools.<br />\nReferee Trouble<br />\n<br />\nMore important than not having a bevy of \"giants\"<br />\nis the fact that the caliber of the referees appearing on<br />\nthe M-D courts is usually very poor. Their faults range<br />\nfrom being \"homers\" to their undying urge to call technical fouls.<br />\nAlmost all of the officials of the Conference make<br />\ntheir livelihood from jobs other than officiating. A crosssection of the M-D officials finds that the list includes<br />\ntyping teachers, amateur baseball coaches, and cake salesmen.<br />\nGlaring evidence of the ineptness of the officials came<br />\nlast Saturday when one rotund whistle man spent much<br />\nof the night on the floor as a result of dodging or colliding with the cagers of both squads.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough Ed Bernstein tallied<br />\n19 points, the Hopkins varsity<br />\nfive bowed to Rutgers, 83-63, at<br />\nNew Brunswick, NJ. on Wednesday.<br />\nBill Civilette was the only<br />\nother Jay to reach double figures<br />\nwith 12 points. Chuck Loughran<br />\ndunked nine points, and Erv Sekulow added eight.<br />\n\"It could be the difference of<br />\nour making the Mason-Dixon<br />\nfinals.\" spoke varsity basketball<br />\ncoach Ross Sachs of Johns Hopkins' forthcoming game with<br />\nRandolph -Maco n, tomorrow<br />\nnight at the Homewood Gym.<br />\nRandolph-Macon's big threat<br />\nis their six foot six inch center,<br />\nKen Joyner.

The Neanderthal<br />\nMan, the \"cave man's\" prot,optype, stood erect, and was intelligent as modern man. Nor did his<br />\nknuckles scrape the earth, according to anthropology Professor William L. Straus, Jr.<br /><br />\nAfter nearly a full semester of cogitation, the NewsLetter has arrived at an educational policy which will<br />\nsolve nearly all significant university and college problems. We humbly present this master concept, which we<br />\ncall the Truly New Plan, in the following paragraphs.<br />\nDr. Straus gave thorough exThe Truly New Plan hinges upon the fact that a col- amination to fossil remains of<br />\nlege degree is necessary to obtain a monetarily satisfactory the \"old Man of La Chapejleaux-Saints,\" a singularly signifand sufficiently secure employment.

Therefore the Truly commonly accepted concept of<br />\nNew Plan has incorporated a unique factor\u2014the ability Neanderthal's posture would<br />\nhave been a ph.ysical impossibilto get a college degree by proxy.<br />\nUnder our plan, the student in the above category<br />\n-would pay tuition to the university and would pay a university-approved group of students to take the exams for<br />\ncourses prerequisite for the degree, after the _candidate<br />\nhad passed certain preliminary intelligence and aptitude<br />\ntests. The total cost would equal the cost of going through<br />\nthe University as a normally enrolled student, or, for example, at the Hopkins roughly $8,000. The grades would<br />\nnot be permitted to rise above a Gentleman's C. They<br />\nwould not be allowed to drop below a D, because of the<br />\nUniversity backing and the amount of money involved.<br />\nAfter four years, the proxy candidate would receive his<br />\ndegree at a graduation exercise, and would be allowed to<br />\nwear a black robe and mortar board.<br />\nDuring the intermittant four years, the proxy candidate would be required to enter the field of his choice, as<br />\nan uneducated but salaried employee. He would thus<br />\nacquire the necessary techniques and would have a sizeable financial margin, even after paying the bill for his<br />\ndegree. Because of his relative isolation, he would be<br />\nsubjected ,to a minimum of disturbing ideas. He would,<br />\nindeed, be better suited to the increasingly popular\" Moretypical-than-thou\" attitude which is slowly filtering<br />\nthrough the Appalachians.<br />\nThe Truly New Plan would secondly ward off the<br />\nimpending threat of tremendous overcrowding resulting<br />\nfrom a more college age population which has more,than<br />\ndoubled in the last two decades. The money which would<br />\nhave been needed to expand facilities could instead be used<br />\nto improve them.<br />\nFinances would no longer be a problem for colleges<br />\nand universities. The probable large proportion of proxy<br />\ncandidates could provide more than surplus funds, since<br />\nthe price of the vellum for the diplomas would be the only<br />\nexpenditure. At Hopkins, for instance, the cost would be<br />\napproximately fifty cents, and the profit would be $3999.50,<br />\nper capita. This would be enough to pay all university expenses and still have enough left over to send athletic<br />\nteams as fiAr as Madagascar at the slightest whim.<br />\nSerious students would find a paradise on earth under<br />\nthe Truly New Plan. They would not be restrained by the<br />\npresence of degree-seekers. School facilities would be<br />\noptimal due to the surplus wealth. The improved quality<br />\nof student would lure the faculty into the long-awaited<br />\npersonal tutelage. Finally about $5000 per proxy would go<br />\nto the students taking his tests. All the fruly brilliant students in the nation could thus be given a superb education;<br />\nthe mediocre ones would reach their inevitable positions<br />\nas technicians, without suffering undue hardships or acquiring inferiority complexes, as they now do.<br />\nThe recent death of- Bill Bain is one of the most<br />\ntragic events in our memory.

He<br />\nstated that from bones such as<br />\nthis, extreme bowleggedness had<br />\nbeen ascribed to Neanderthal,<br />\nfurther compounding his ambulatory woes.

While we do not profess to have the court experience of this coach, we feel that this statement must be<br />\nqualified in some respect.<br />\nWe believe that the schools in the M-D loop lack<br />\ntall cagers so prominent in the small college fives of the<br />\nmid-west and upper New York. This does not necessarily<br />\nhurt the quality of the game, for in many circles the<br />\n\"goons\" of the court are being soundly criticized. However, it is mentioned only to show that the M-D schools do<br />\nlack a very necessary ingredient that prevents them from<br />\nbeing classed with the top flight small cage schools.<br />\nReferee Trouble<br /><br />\nMore important than not having a bevy of \"giants\"<br />\nis the fact that the caliber of the referees appearing on<br />\nthe M-D courts is usually very poor. Their faults range<br />\nfrom being \"homers\" to their undying urge to call technical fouls.<br />\nAlmost all of the officials of the Conference make<br />\ntheir livelihood from jobs other than officiating.
