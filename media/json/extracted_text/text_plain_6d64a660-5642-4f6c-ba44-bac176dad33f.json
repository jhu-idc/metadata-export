College traditions<br />\nare different in various institutions, and grant the members of<br />\nthe Senior class distinctions which<br />\nMake them more or less conspicuous. Hopkins permits the members<br />\nof the graduating class and no other undergraudates the privilege of<br />\nusing the main entrance to Gilman Hall leading up from the<br />\ncenter of the quadrangle. This<br />\nmeans something which all Seniors<br />\nshould realize and respect. \"<br />\nThere is a bronze shield of the<br />\nUniversity in the middle of the<br />\nfloor inside the entrance on which<br />\nDO one should tread. Of course,<br />\nsome of the uninitiated will walk<br />\nover this shield without realizing<br />\nperhaps that by doing so they are<br />\ntrampling on the emblem which<br />\nstands for so much.<br />\nIt falls to the lot of the Seniors<br />\nto create such a spirit that all<br />\ntrue lovers of Hopkins and its traditions will glance at that shield<br />\nand walk by it with a deep realization of its meaning and be inspired<br />\nto add to the attainments which<br />\nmen in the past have done to make<br />\nHopkins as well known as it is<br />\ntoday.<br />\nThe Seniors this year do not<br />\nseem to truly appreciate this privilege as they should.

Hopkins permits the members<br />\nof the graduating class and no other undergraudates the privilege of<br />\nusing the main entrance to Gilman Hall leading up from the<br />\ncenter of the quadrangle. This<br />\nmeans something which all Seniors<br />\nshould realize and respect. \"<br />\nThere is a bronze shield of the<br />\nUniversity in the middle of the<br />\nfloor inside the entrance on which<br />\nDO one should tread.

The<br />\nflag should either be removed altogether, if it is not to be cared for,<br />\nor it should be taken down and<br />\ncleaned.
