But for 24 of the<br />\n150 students living in The Bradford, a university-owned apartment building which offers such<br />\nluxuries as air conditioning and<br />\nwall-to-wall carpeting, the comfort and convenience they had expected turned into a disaster soon<br />\nafter they moved in.<br />\nOn September 9, at approximately 3:00 a.m., water began<br />\nto leak through the ceiling of six<br />\nof the apartments, flooding<br />\nbedrooms, bathrooms, living<br />\nrooms, and hallways. The source<br />\n<br />\nof the water leak was a pipe in<br />\napartment 801 that had been<br />\ndamaged.<br />\nThe pipe had been punctured<br />\nby a screw when kitchen cabinets<br />\nwere installed in the eighth floor<br />\napartment by construction<br />\nworkers earlier in this year. Continual pressure over several<br />\nweeks caused it to weaken until<br />\nfinally it burst, causing water to<br />\nleak down to the apartments as far<br />\nbelow as the third floor.<br />\nThe damage was extensive in<br />\nmost of the apartments. Water<br />\nruined the wall-to-wall carpeting<br />\nand the wooden floors beneath<br />\nand caused paint on the walls to<br />\npeel and chip. Some kitchen tiling and furniture had to be<br />\nrepaired, and ceilings needed to<br />\nbe replaced.<br />\nHopkins students living in the<br />\ndamaged Bradford apartments ex-<br />\n<br />\nWater leak damages Bradford Apartments.<br />\n<br />\nSohnia Hong<br />\n<br />\npressed their unhappiness with<br />\nthe way the University handled<br />\nthe incident. Evelyn Jerome, a<br />\nresident of apartment 701, expressed her frustration with the<br />\nhousing office for failing to inform students when inspectors<br />\nwould be coming to check the<br />\ndamage and when repairs would<br />\nbe made. Students complained<br />\nthat there would often be groups<br />\nof ten or twelve people walking<br />\nin and out of their apartments, yet<br />\nthey were never informed of who<br />\nthey were or why they were<br />\nthere. The Housing Office did not<br />\nrespond to letters from students<br />\nasking for explanations.<br />\nStudents also did not feel that<br />\nrepairs were made -quickly<br />\nenough. The wet carpeting was<br />\nnot removed until the following<br />\nFriday, and the walls and ceilings<br />\nwere not replaced until two weeks<br />\nafter the incident. Temporary<br />\ncarpeting was laid down the next<br />\nMonday, but the new carpeting<br />\nwill not be installed until<br />\nNovember 3.<br />\nCarol Mohr of the Housing Office stated that the University<br />\nmade every effort to respond to<br />\nthe situation as quickly as possible. \"Our major concern was<br />\nspeed,\" she said. While some<br />\ncompanies had estimated three to<br />\nfour weeks to make the repairs,<br />\nthe University insisted on having<br />\nthe major work done in two<br />\nweeks. She explained that the<br />\nnew carpeting had to be ordered<br />\nand therefore would not be<br />\n<br />\navailable until the end of October.<br />\nTemporary .carpeting was supplied as soon as possible,<br />\nhowever, she stated.<br />\nThe reason for the lack ofcommunication with the students, according to Mohr, was the absence<br />\nof available information at the<br />\ntime; the University had not<br />\nreceived any feedback from the<br />\nrepairmen or the insurance company about when the repairs<br />\nwould be completed.<br />\nAlthough students will still be<br />\nexpected to pay the entire rent for<br />\nthe month of September, the<br />\nHousing Office did offer to pay<br />\nSeptember's electric bill for the<br />\nstudents, who were asked to run<br />\ndehumidifiers and to leave their<br />\nair conditioners on throughout the<br />\nweek to air out the apartments.<br />\nTo some students, however,<br />\nthis is only a minimal compensation. Jerome proposed that the<br />\nstudents whose apartments were<br />\ndamaged only pay three quarters<br />\nof the month's rent of $1260, but<br />\nthe Housing Office has yet to respond to her suggestion. Mohr indicated, however, that there was<br />\nno plan on the part of the University to compensate the students<br />\naside from paying the electric<br />\nbills for September.<br />\nShe stated that \"the University cannot predict such accidents<br />\nnor prevent them from happening.'<br />\n'The administration regrets<br />\nthe inconvenience, but feels that<br />\nit did all that it could to mend the<br />\nContinued on page 2<br />\n<br />\nDr. David Discusses Future<br />\nOf Post-Cold War World<br />\nby Erica Gum<br />\nAddressing the issue of the<br />\n\"War & Peace in the post-Cold<br />\nWar world,\" Dr. Steven David<br />\nsaid, \"I'm happy that the Cold<br />\nWar is over,\" at this week's<br />\nWednesday Noon Lecture in the<br />\nGarrett Room.<br />\nDavid, a professor of Political<br />\nScience, at the University said<br />\nthat he remains somewhat<br />\nnostalgic for the days of the Cold<br />\nWar, because it preserved peace<br />\nfor the most part.

The behavior of the<br />\nSoviet Union was generally stable<br />\nand predictable. The Soviet<br />\nUnion, David explained, now has<br />\nits \"capabilites largely intact, but<br />\nits intentions largely unkown.\"<br />\nDavid said that the possibilities<br />\nof a military coup, or the<br />\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union<br />\nitself cannot be ruled out. He<br />\nnoted that the Soviets still have<br />\na very large military force and a<br />\nlarge number of nuclear<br />\nweapons. He said that he would<br />\nfeel more comfortable if those'<br />\nforces were in the hands of the<br />\nKGB rather that in the hands of<br />\na crazy ethnic group. \"And I<br />\nnever thought I'd have anything<br />\nnice to say about the KGB.\"<br />\nRegarding other changes in<br />\nEurope, David said that the<br />\nemergence of democracies in<br />\nEastern Europe has also seen the<br />\nrise of ethnic hatred.

Headed by Writing<br />\nSeminars Associate Professor<br />\nMark Crispin Miller, the forum<br />\nwas created \"to improve people's<br />\nawareness of the way political ads<br />\nwork visually.\"<br />\nIn addition, the forum's goal is<br />\nto help viewers recognize the<br />\nvisual tricks and devices used to<br />\npromote and sell the candidates.<br />\nLinda Benn of the University of<br />\nMaryland's American Studies<br />\nDepartment joined Miller in what<br />\nhe referred to as the first of an<br />\n\"experimental series of discussions.\"<br />\nMuch of the hour-long forum<br />\nwas devoted to the 1988<br />\nPresidential Campaign. Miller<br />\nexplained that television campaign advertising for the<br />\nDemocrats and Republicans did<br />\nnot follow a rational format; it<br />\nwas visual rather than verbal and<br />\noperated in a more visceral way.<br />\nHe also said that these campaign<br />\nads were much more influential<br />\nthan ads for products. According<br />\nto Miller, advertising helped<br />\ndecide the presidential race in<br />\n1988.<br />\nWhile the forum followed a<br />\nbipartisan approach in analyzing<br />\ntelevision advertising, Miller and<br />\nBenn stressed the advantages<br />\npossessed by the Republican<br />\nParty. According to Benn,<br />\n\"There is a unified vision of<br />\nwholeness in the Republicans'<br />\nads.\" She added, \"Their commercials work together to create<br />\npositive images for Bush and<br />\n<br />\nnegative ones for Dukakis.\" Four<br />\nsuch commercials were reviewed during the forum.<br />\nBenn explained, \"Bush is<br />\nassociated with the pillar of<br />\nstrength. . . he's wearing red,<br />\nwhite, and blue. . .and exudes<br />\npurity and patriotism.\" She<br />\nnoted, however,\"No political or<br />\nfactual substance is presented in<br />\nany of these commercials.\"<br />\nMiller added, \"There is a constant association of Dukakis with<br />\nthe excremental,\" as he referred<br />\nspecifically to the Boston Harbor<br />\ncommercial. \"The Republicans<br />\nare characterized by the use of the<br />\nwords 'we,' us,\"family,' and<br />\n'hard work,' while the Democrats<br />\nare associated with 'failure,'<br />\n'taxes,'. . .'crime.\"<br />\nMiller said, however, \"The<br />\nRepublicans share a distinct advantage because the myth that<br />\nthey sell is more suitable to television than the myth the Democrats<br />\nsell.\" He added, \"The<br />\nDemocrats are cursed with a<br />\nmyth of diversity, the multiracial,<br />\nmultiplicity, fragmentation, and<br />\nuneasiness. They don't as easily<br />\nfocus on a unique characteristic<br />\nas the Republicans.\"<br />\nMiller and Benn also discussed the gubernatorial race in<br />\nCalifornia between former Congressman Pete Wilson and former<br />\nSan Francisco Mayor Diana<br />\nFeinstein, as well as the North<br />\nCarolina senate race between<br />\nJesse Helms and his black opponent Harvey Gantt.<br />\n\"The most typical negative<br />\nads,\" Miller said, \"are the most<br />\nuninteresting and the most<br />\nuneffective-the ones with an<br />\nunflattering picture of the opposContinued on page 3<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Ranked Fifteenth<br />\nAmong 'America's Top Colleges'<br />\nTIINI FINAL RANKIN& The<br />\n<br />\nTop 25 National Universities<br />\nSAT ACT<br />\nOstAall<br />\nscot<br />\n<br />\nI.

Air that was about<br />\nfifty degrees below room<br />\ntemperature hit them as the door<br />\nopened, and even though Miranda was wearing David's sweatshirt(which he had given her on<br />\ntheir last date before Miranda had<br />\nto leave San Diego for school)<br />\nand a heavy pair of jeans, it<br />\nseemed to her that she had walked into something from a Jack<br />\nLondon novel.<br />\n\"Ah,the comfort and smell of<br />\nthe air conditioner!\" Zack<br />\ngrinned. To Zack, if air wasn't<br />\nprocessed and climate-controlled,<br />\nit wasn't fit to breathe.<br />\nDoris took a piece of paper out<br />\nof her pocket.<br />\n\"What's that?\" Miranda<br />\nasked.<br />\n\"Well, since we were coming,<br />\nI figured we could get a few other<br />\nthings we needed.\"<br />\n\"I thought you only needed<br />\nchocolate chips.\"<br />\n\"Miranda, how long have you<br />\nbeen living with Julia Child<br />\nhere?\" Zack asked.<br />\n\"Point.\"<br />\n\"Hey!\" Doris interrupted.<br />\n\"There's Don Wilkins. . .he's in<br />\nmy Political Gaffes: 1924-1927<br />\nclass. . \"Her voice lowered. \"I<br />\nthink he's hitting on me.\"<br />\n\"I.. .uh . ..\"Miranda began.<br />\n\"I'm going to go talk to him.\"<br />\nDoris bounded off.<br />\nMiranda shook her head and<br />\ngrabbed a basket.

'I can tell.'<br />\n<br />\ncarefully over the frozen fried<br />\nchicken.<br />\n\"Miranda,\" he asked. \"Swanson or Bird's Eye. I hate this. The<br />\nSwanson box says 8-10 pieces,<br />\nand the Bird's Eye says 9-11, but<br />\nthe Swanson weighs more.\"<br />\n\"Zack,\" Miranda asked.<br />\n\"Does it really matter?\"<br />\n\"Well, the more pieces in it,<br />\nthe less meals I have to cook.\"<br />\n\"That's not cooking, Zack. It's<br />\nheating.\"<br />\n\"The less meals I have to<br />\nheat.\"<br />\n\"Go with the Swanson.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, that's what I was thinking.\" Zack returned to his internal poultry struggle.<br />\n\"I'm sure he's hitting on me,\"<br />\nDoris said, appearing from the<br />\ncereal aisle with a carton of<br />\noatmeal in her hands. \"I can<br />\ntell.\"<br />\n\"Doris.\" Miranda looked at<br />\nher roommate firmly. \"He was<br />\nnot hitting on you.\"<br />\n\"How do you know?\" Zack<br />\nContinued on page 4<br />\n<br />\nROTC Committee Serves No Purpose<br />\n\"Hopkins is ten years behind its peer institutions in addressing this issue.\" Dean of Arts and Sciences Lloyd Armstrong<br />\nmade this statement two and a half years ago in a meeting with<br />\nmembers of the Feminist Alliance (now the Women's Center).<br />\nHe was refering to hiring policies and practices throughout the<br />\nUniversity, in response to questions concerning the exceptionally low numbers of non-male, non-caucasian administrators and<br />\ntenured faculty members.<br />\nNow questions have been raised about another aspect of this<br />\ninstitution\u2014ROTC. Dean Armstrong may have to pull his statement out of the stack of administrative \"admissions\" and use<br />\nit again soon, for there is no evidence that the questions of civil<br />\n(student) rights,jurisdiction, and complicity at the heart of the<br />\nROTC \"debate\" will be intelligently or effectively addressed<br />\nby President Richardson and his fellow administrators.<br />\nDean of Students Susan Boswell is the head of the committee appointed by Richardson to \"examine the issue of ROTC<br />\nat Hopkins.\" In a prepared statement, however, Richardson<br />\nsaid that he \"does not anticipate a circumstance under which<br />\n[the University] would sever its ties with the ROTC unit.\" Why,<br />\nthen, has the committee been established, and what<br />\ncan it accomplish?<br />\nThough the precise mission of the committee is not clear,<br />\nperhaps one of its charges is to determine if there is a conflict<br />\nbetween the values and mission of the University and the<br />\nDepartment of Defense, and if this conflict interferes substantially with the rights and well-being of members of the \"Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nDepartment of Defense directive 1332.14 prohibits homosexuals from entering any branch of the armed forces. It is not<br />\nclear, however, what criteria the DoD uses to identify a<br />\n\"homosexual\" or how it upholds this directive. Recent evidence<br />\nin the media suggests that the most effective\u2014and currently the<br />\nmost \"popular\"\u2014way to be excluded from the military for being a \"homosexual\"(or because of one's current or predominant sexual preference? or one's most recent physical intimacy<br />\n<br />\nwith another person?) is for someone already in the military<br />\nto stand up and say \"I am gay.\" So the DoD prohibition is<br />\nenacted only after it has failed and a \"homosexual\" is serving<br />\nin the military.<br />\nWith this in mind, and using reliable national data, it is highly<br />\nprobable statistically that there are members of the Hopkins<br />\nROTC program who identify themselves as \"homosexuals.\"<br />\nThere are administrators, faculty and staff members, and many<br />\nstudents (500? 750? 1000?) who fall into the category<br />\n\"homosexual\" as the DoD seems to use it. If so, there is nothing<br />\nto investigate\u2014discrimination on the basis of \"homosexuality\" affects members of the Hopkins community.<br />\nDoes the committee intend to investigate the positive versus<br />\nnegative impact of having ROTC on our campus? There is no<br />\nway to measure the benefits enjoyed by a small number of<br />\nHopkins students who participate in ROTC against the harm<br />\ncaused by discrimination. The benefits of ROTC are not being<br />\nchallenged. And many Hopkins students acquire financial aid<br />\nand leadership skills without the \"help\" of ROTC.<br />\nAcross the country, colleges and universities are taking<br />\ndefinitive action to protest DoD policies and university complicity. Within the next two years, students at Harvard who<br />\nare members of an ROTC battalion at other campuses will no<br />\nlonger be allowed to use ROTC funds for their Harvard education. (Harvard does not have its own ROTC program.) This<br />\naction, and actions like it, exert whatever influence possible<br />\nover the DoD while protecting the rights of the students.<br />\nHarvard ROTC cadets will have to look for either alternative<br />\nfunds or an alternative school. But no student at Harvard will<br />\nwonder about her or his status because of her or his private<br />\nlife. Hopkins students, faculty, staff, and administrators deserve<br />\nthe same. They also deserve more than a perfunctory presidential committee with no charge other than to rubber-stamp<br />\nRichardson's unwillingness to take action on behalf of the<br />\nmembers of this University community.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nIn Which the Administration Learns 'Who Is Complaining',<br />\nA Response to Dr. Gryder, Scientists, Activists, Differences<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n<br />\nI was deeply disturbed upon<br />\nreading last week's edition of the<br />\nNews-Letter, in which various administrators directly or indirectly<br />\ndefended their inexcusable lack of<br />\naction on the ROTC issue. I was not<br />\namazed to find that President<br />\nRichardson justifies his lack of com-'<br />\nmittment to the issue by upholding<br />\na conclusively ineffective letter sent<br />\nfive months ago to Dick Cheney and<br />\nan ad hoc committee, which will<br />\nmerely \"prepare a report for<br />\nRichardson about ROTC at<br />\nHopkins\" but will not have any<br />\nundergraduate representation nor<br />\nany power over the final decision on<br />\nHopkins policy. This stance is<br />\nnothing less than an attempt to put<br />\noff the issue in an extremely<br />\nbureaucratic way, in hope that the<br />\nmost vocal of the \"complainers\"<br />\nwill go away.<br />\nThis raises the most important<br />\nquestion, presented last week as<br />\n\"Who is complaining?\" The<br />\nparagraphs that follow were simply<br />\nappalling. In them, Dean Armstrong, Bob Nelson, and Estelle<br />\nFishbein stated that the issue has<br />\nseldom or never been brought to<br />\ntheir attention by students. In other<br />\nwords, campus apathy is a sufficient<br />\nreason to ignore a vitally important<br />\nissue. Listen, if we waited for<br />\nstudents to raise a mob of protest for<br />\nevery issue that concerned them,<br />\nmost issues would never be addressed. It's a commonplace phenomenon<br />\nhere at Hopkins\u2014not enough people<br />\ntake the time to show their support<br />\nfor what they believe in, and virtually none put forth the effort to fight<br />\nthe constant bureaucratic sedation in<br />\norder to make the essential changes.<br />\nI know that support exists for this<br />\nissue. Thankfully, someone has<br />\nfinally emerged from the student<br />\nbody who is willing to lead the fight<br />\nagainst the administration's<br />\nhypocracy. But we must all show<br />\nthat we care enough to force a<br />\nchange. We are being excluded from<br />\nthe outcome of this debate because<br />\nthe administration thinks we are one<br />\nman with a few enthusiastic letterwriters in his wake. We are indeed<br />\n3000, and we must not let ourselves<br />\nbe discounted as an apathetic mass<br />\nwith no opinion. Dr. Richardson<br />\nwould like nothing better than to let<br />\nthe students lose whatever enthusiasm<br />\nthey now feel, allowing him to deal<br />\nwith the issue as he chooses; i.e.,<br />\nthere will be no change.<br />\nWe all know what the issue is. If<br />\nyou don't, read the last few editions.<br />\nThe position of the DOD is<br />\ndiscriminatory and therefore contradictory to the goals of the University. It's as simple as that. We can't<br />\ncompromise our principles because<br />\nit seems that no one cares. So get involved and show them you do with<br />\nyour voices and your pens.<br />\nErik D.

The Department<br />\nof Defense's exclusionary policy<br />\nagainst gays and lesbians in ROTC<br />\nunits is antithetical to the spirit and<br />\nletter of the University's stance<br />\nagainst discrimination. Yet, President Richardson, who in other<br />\nvenues has expressed his belief in the<br />\nhumanistic values of the institution,<br />\nsays he \"does not anticipate a circumstance under which the<br />\nUniversity would sever its ties with<br />\nthe ROTC unit.\" With his decision<br />\non the issue apparently made,<br />\nRichardson is still going through the<br />\ncharade of appointing a committee<br />\non the ROTC issue, to be chaired by<br />\nDean of Students Susan Boswell,<br />\nwhen Boswell has said herself, in the<br />\nSeptember 28th News-Letter, that<br />\n\"direction (on the ROTC issue) will<br />\ncome from the President.\" The<br />\nPresident has set his direction it<br />\nseems, and it is time for those who<br />\nbelieve discrimination can play no<br />\nrole on this campus to set our own.<br />\nEqually disturbing in last week's<br />\narticle was the writer's rhetorical<br />\nquestion about who is raising all the<br />\nfuss about gays and lesbians in<br />\nROTC in the first place. Dean Armstrong, Estelle Fishbein, University<br />\nGeneral Counsel, and Bob Nelson,<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council President, are<br />\nquoted that they have heard little or<br />\nno direct protest on the issue. The<br />\nclear implication is that if no one is<br />\ncomplaining, nothing is wrong, and<br />\nnothing needs to be done. This \"let's<br />\nnot rock the boat\" if we're not sinking philosophy may be fine when it<br />\ncomes to issues like a student union,<br />\ncourse offerings and the like, but it<br />\nis morally incompatible with clearcut issues of discrimination.<br />\nMoreover, has anyone realized that<br />\ngay and lesbian students in ROTC<br />\nmay not be complaining for fear of<br />\nlosing scholarships in the program?<br />\nAdmittedly, Paul DelGrosso, President of GALA,has raised this issue,<br />\nbut by no means should this be seen<br />\nas GALA's struggle alone. Nor is<br />\nthis effort anti-ROTC or antimilitary,, but rather a case against a<br />\ndiscriminatory policy that conflicts<br />\nwith the mandate of the university,<br />\nUltimately, what saddens me the<br />\nmost is that we need a Paul<br />\nDelGrosso to remind our community of its legal and moral obligations<br />\nto its members.<br />\nJonathan Roberts<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWhile it is always touching to read<br />\nfraternity brothers' defenses of one<br />\nanother for various misgivings,<br />\nDavid Boxenbaum has caught<br />\n<br />\nhimself in a bit of a hypocrisy in his<br />\nIn reference to Dr. Gryder's letter in last week's issue, I submit the<br />\nfollowing response.<br />\nI agree that the Department of<br />\nBiology is very good at what it does<br />\nand at what is taught. Hopkins<br />\nBiology majors' foundation in<br />\nbiochemistry is extensive and serves<br />\nas a building block for all other<br />\nsciences. My concern with the<br />\nDepartment of Biology is based on<br />\nits limitations. I feel that the addition of a few extra courses such as<br />\nGeneral Biology, Anatomy, and<br />\nMicrobiology would strengthen the<br />\ncurriculum without diminishing the<br />\ndepartment's strong points.

Best was the solo portion, the highlights of which<br />\nwere \"Neighborhood Girls\"<br />\nand \"Knight Moves.\" Vega<br />\npunctuated the set with several<br />\nstories; while some of her<br />\njokes were funny and the mood<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\nPlisse Takara<br />\n<br />\nSuzanne Vega leaves her acoustic guitar behind and takes the mic<br />\nalone.<br />\n<br />\nterested by \"Marlene On The<br />\nWall\" and \"The Queen and<br />\nthe Soldier\" (the first encore),<br />\nseemed bothered by the virtual<br />\nobligation to play \"Luka,\"<br />\nand appeared uncomfortable<br />\nwhen singing without her<br />\nacoustic guitar. Her most active composition, the folkrocking \"Left Of Center,\"<br />\nallowed the band to escape<br />\ntheir session-musician backing<br />\nroles and breathe more life into<br />\nthe performance.<br />\nThe only glimpse the audience got of Vega's true personality (besides the stories,<br />\nwhich she tells almost every<br />\nnight) occurred during the<br />\na capella encore \"Tom's<br />\nDiner,\" in which she forgot<br />\nthe third verse while attempting to lead a Shriver-sized<br />\nsing-a-long. Vega laughed,<br />\ntried vainly to cover with a<br />\njoke, and blushed. It was the<br />\nonly time she seemed truly<br />\nhuman during the show, and<br />\nwhile she atoned with an atmospheric rendition of<br />\n\"Wooden Horse\" for the<br />\nfinale, the goof was ironically<br />\nthe most telling moment in the<br />\nperformance.<br />\nSuzanne Vega's performance was fairly predictable:<br />\nit was ideal for her fans, and<br />\nmight win over casual<br />\nlisteners, but her critics would<br />\nfind little convincing material,<br />\nespecially since the performances were mostly replications of album tracks for the<br />\nstage. Although parts of her set<br />\ncould scarcely escape a critical<br />\neye, Vega was mostly effective<br />\nand quite enjoyable, if a little<br />\ngloomy.

It is the<br />\nstory of Eugene Debs Hartke and<br />\nhis involvement in a massive<br />\nprison breakout in fictional<br />\nicipio, New York.

But this<br />\nfreedom has dangerous consequences as well.<br />\nThroughout the Hartke narrative, Vonnegut describes his<br />\nown dystopic vision of the future.<br />\nHe takes certain aspects of<br />\nAmerican society during the '80s<br />\nand depicts the sort of society into<br />\nwhich these aspects might<br />\ndevelop by 2001, where the<br />\nstorytelling takes place. And as<br />\nVonnegut describes it, the United<br />\nStates of 2001 is pretty much a<br />\nbuzz-kill: \"If all had gone the<br />\nway a lot of people thought it<br />\nwould, Jesus Christ would have<br />\n<br />\nbetween ideas. The scraps don't<br />\nseem enough like scraps to me.<br />\nThey seem too coherent as individual pieces, too consistent in<br />\nquality to be written on loose<br />\npieces.

Also included are<br />\nSonic Youth (not playing music<br />\nbut making atmospheric feedback<br />\nsounds), John Cale, and Donald<br />\nFagen, whose old band, Steely<br />\nDan, took its name from The<br />\nNaked Lunch.

Original<br />\njazz compositions by Marc Ribot,<br />\nBill Frisell, Gary Windo,<br />\nMichael Blair, and Lenny Pickett<br />\n(among others) serve as the backing tracks for Ginsberg's poetry<br />\nreadings; G.E.

The most<br />\nunusual is a CD bonus track,<br />\n\"C'mon Jack,\" a brief homosexual fantasy set to a smarmy accompaniment by Steve Swallow.<br />\nGinsberg's liner notes are a big<br />\nhelp, as is the text of the poems<br />\nthemselves, printed on the sleeve.<br />\nAlthough some of the poems are<br />\nlyri,cal in nature, Ginsberg shuns<br />\nsinging for recitation, as he puts<br />\nit, \"relieved to leave music to the<br />\nhonorable musicians.\"<br />\nIt's a bit strange in 1990 to hear<br />\ntwo elder statesmen like Ginsberg<br />\nand Burroughs on compact disc,<br />\nbut it makes sense.

With Love Is<br />\nStrange, Rogers has glided onto<br />\na new, impressively barren plane.<br />\nThis is a musical universe that<br />\nallows for no variation, a place<br />\nwhere emotion collapses into an<br />\nantiseptic infinity of lyrics with<br />\nas much personality as an average<br />\nclump of astroturf.<br />\nBut is this country music? It<br />\nmight not be fair to pigeonhole<br />\nthe man who gave the world<br />\n\"The Gambler,\" \"Lady,\" and<br />\nmy favorite, \"Coward of \u2022 the<br />\nCounty.\" Love Is Strange contains none of the things that I<br />\nassociate with good country<br />\nmusic\u2014small-town tales, occasionally cheesy but heartfelt instrumental work, lyrics that explore bizarre but functional<br />\nrelationships\u2014except its traditional brand of cutesy sexism,<br />\n<br />\nwhich is in abundant evidence.<br />\nNot all of the songs are predictable, but those that aren't (like<br />\nthe nauseous \"If!

Ro<br />\nTruman Capote once said that<br />\nlove is a matter of concentration.<br />\nTo win over the objects of one's<br />\ndevotion, one simply focuses on<br />\nhim or her, using all the subtle<br />\npowers and unspoken communication to draw their attention. To paraphrase his own<br />\nwords, no one can resist being admired, and so Capote supposedly placed his greatest faith in flattery. Certainly no writer has done<br />\nit better and more enchantingly<br />\nthan Capote, whose words and<br />\nmemories are recreated onstage<br />\nin Tru. Robert Morse is the actor<br />\nwho delivers an exacting performance that seems to resurrect the<br />\npersona of a true American<br />\neccentric.<br />\nThe play begins in December<br />\nof 1975, with Capote recalling<br />\njovially, telephone in hand, in his<br />\napartment in New York. He is<br />\ngossiping with (and flattering)<br />\none of his jet-set compadres. The<br />\ndoorbell rings and Capote puts<br />\ndown the phone and runs gleefully to greet the unexpected visitor.<br />\nIt is, in fact, a monstrous arrangement of poinsettias, laughably<br />\ngaudy. This provides Capote the<br />\nopportunity to bash the gist deftly with his disdainful wit and<br />\nentertain his friend at the same<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe rest of the play is a series<br />\nof monologues punctuated by<br />\nmore telephone calls and<br />\nflashbacks. In one moment, he is<br />\ntelling the audience about a book<br />\nhe wrote about convicts, which<br />\nreminds him of trip to Taiwan, of<br />\ndogs in cages, and then he's on<br />\nthe phone again with his manager<br />\nnegotiating a deal on his next<br />\nbook. It's stream of consciousness, but with a structure<br />\nthat is given color by Capote's<br />\nseemingly aimless progress of<br />\nthought. He discusses his enormpus circle of wealthy friends,<br />\n<br />\nand how little he cares for them.<br />\nHe effuses with the joy of<br />\nChristmas, yet reveals a tragic<br />\nevent from his past that will<br />\nforever ruin it for him. He comments on love, true friendship,<br />\nand ostracism. While there is no<br />\nreal story-line, each monologue<br />\nserves as an independent story in<br />\n<br />\nNo writer has<br />\nexploited flattery<br />\nbetter and more<br />\nenchantingly than<br />\nCapote, whose<br />\nwords and<br />\nmemories are<br />\nrecreated onstage<br />\nin Tru, playing<br />\nthrough October<br />\n28 at the<br />\nMechanic.<br />\nits own right. Taken together,<br />\nthey all point to the man who tells<br />\nthem, lending insight, evoking<br />\nsympathy, and linking themselves<br />\ninto one psychologically coherent<br />\nwhole. In short, it seems as<br />\nthough everything that ever affected Capote, and anything you<br />\nmay have wanted to know about<br />\n<br />\nhim, is treated in this tribute,<br />\nwhich is a credit to writerdirector Jay Allen Pressman.<br />\nBut for those not familiar with<br />\nCapote, and the endless number<br />\nof articles printed about him both<br />\nduring and after his lifetime, the<br />\ninside jokes may be lost on you.<br />\nMost of the baby-boomers in the<br />\naudience laughed robustly, but<br />\nyounger viewers may find<br />\nthemselves garnering chuckles<br />\nonly from the slapsticks and<br />\nCalifornia jokes.<br />\nSignificantly, Pressman glosses<br />\nover Capote's fall from the<br />\ntrusted and acclaimed echelons of<br />\nhigh society, perhaps counting<br />\nagain on the audience's familiarity. Nevertheless, it remains a<br />\nsubject in need of deeper treatment. Capote was at work on<br />\nAnswered Prayers, a semiautobiographical book, at the<br />\ntime this play is set. In the month<br />\nprevious, Esquire had printed a<br />\nchapter from his book and, just<br />\nshort of lynching the rich, the excerpt had revealed their \"sexual<br />\nlicense and ethical squalor\" with<br />\nall the names changed.<br />\nThe play supposedly begins<br />\nwith Capote suffering amidst the<br />\naftermath of his tattle-telling, but<br />\ndevotes little time recounting the<br />\nevent, much less explaining it.<br />\nWe simply see him alone this<br />\nholiday season, searching his<br />\nthoughts for a mental escape from<br />\nhis imposed ostracism. Another<br />\ngap in Capote's life here is the<br />\nperiod in which he metamorphosized from the sad, desperate<br />\nchild into the radiantly successful<br />\nartist. It's a notable flaw, as the<br />\nplay is geared for revelations and<br />\naudience-character empathy.<br />\nRobert Morse does a wonderful job performing Truman<br />\nCapote.

In<br />\nwhat they had hoped would be a<br />\ntypical eleven vs. eleven soccer<br />\nmatch, the visiting Blue Jays<br />\nfound instead a \"lopsided\" game<br />\nthat included both officials and<br />\nDickinson players on the home<br />\nteam roster.<br />\n\"The cards wouldn't have been<br />\nthat unusual if the refs had called the game evenly. But when<br />\nyour team gets seven yellows and<br />\nthey get none, you have to<br />\nwonder,\" said senior co-captain<br />\nGeoff Manning.<br />\nWarren Jones, the other<br />\nHopkins co-captain and recipient<br />\nof the game's only red card,<br />\nagreed. \"The refereeing was<br />\nridiculous. They weren't carding<br />\nat all for physical fouls, but they<br />\ndid for moronic reasons [like talking to officials].\"<br />\nIndeed, the referees accepted<br />\nno lobbying from the Blue Jays,<br />\nfirst slapping Jones with a yellow<br />\nwarning card in a dispute over the<br />\nten-yard free kick zone, then with<br />\na red card for applauding a call<br />\nlater in the game. \"I guess the ref<br />\nthought I was being sarcastic or<br />\nsomething, but even then I<br />\nshouldn't have been carded for<br />\nit,\" Jones explained.<br />\nJones and Manning were quick<br />\nto admit, though, that the officiating was not the only factor<br />\nbarring a Hopkins win. The Blue<br />\nJays set the tempo and stayed<br />\nwith their game plan, but<br />\nsquandered numerous scoring opportunities, Manning said. Early in the first game, senior mid-<br />\n<br />\nfielder Rich Bronshvag capitalized on classmate Andrew Janis'<br />\npass to net Hopkins' only goal.<br />\n\"We have had the same problem throughout the season,\"<br />\nJones explained.\"We go out and<br />\nscore early and then relax, thinking we've got the game won.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays paid dearly for<br />\nthe lapse, struggling through two<br />\novertimes before finally ending<br />\nthe game in a draw. \"That kind<br />\nof game gets you fired up, but it's<br />\nalso frustrating. It makes you<br />\nwant to go right back out there<br />\nand play again,\" Jones said.<br />\nDespite the frustration, the<br />\nBlue Jays were able to call on<br />\ntheir positive attitude to carry<br />\nthem into the next game, said<br />\nhead coach Mark Butler. \"The<br />\nteam is able to recognize that on<br />\nany given day something could<br />\nhappen that is beyond their power<br />\nto control.. .it could just be their<br />\nopponent's lucky day, so this<br />\ndoesn't affect them very much.\"<br />\nIf anything, the players channeled their frustration toward a<br />\nsound defeat of Western<br />\nMaryland on Tuesday afternoon<br />\nin Lancaster. Though the chief<br />\ndifference between the two games<br />\nwas \"clearly the officiating,\"<br />\nManning said, the Blue Jays also<br />\nshowed exceptional control in adjusting their game plan to fit the<br />\nhost team's physical style.<br />\n\"We were very casual and<br />\nworked the ball well. Because of<br />\ntheir short field, we were able to<br />\nsit back in a defensive posture and<br />\ncontrol the game from our own<br />\nhalf of the field,\" Manning explained, crediting Butler with a<br />\nshrewd change in strategy.<br />\nBronshvag again led the Blue<br />\nJay attack, scoring the team's first<br />\ngoal 22 minutes into the game on<br />\na pass from junior midfielder<br />\nMyles Flynn. The Green Terror<br />\nstruck back ten minutes later to<br />\ntie the score, but this time<br />\n\u2022 Hopkins did not relax.<br />\nSophomore defenseman Mike<br />\nVandekieft set up senior forward<br />\nTodd Marshall just two minutes<br />\nlater, to give Hopkins a 2-1 edge<br />\n<br />\nat half-time.<br />\nIn the second half, Vandekieft<br />\nagain took charge, making a<br />\nbrilliant run down the sideline and<br />\ndrawing a foul inside the penalty<br />\nbox. Bronshvag scored on the ensuing penalty kick to seal the 3-1<br />\nvictory.<br />\nButler complimented the play<br />\nof his reserves, who were called<br />\nupon to fill in gaps left by Janis<br />\nand Jones, respectively sidelined<br />\nwith an injury and a red card<br />\nfrom the previous game. \"They<br />\nwere up for the challenge, but I<br />\nexpected it of them,\" Butler commented. \"I am never concerned<br />\nabout putting any one player in<br />\nbecause I know they'll adjust and<br />\ndo what we need them to do.<br />\n\"Recently Nick Martin has<br />\nbeen our most stable player,\" he<br />\ncontinued. \"We can always count<br />\non him to do his job. But really,<br />\nthe whole team collectively stands<br />\nout.\"<br />\nScoring has been remarkably<br />\nspread out this season, with ten<br />\ndifferent Blue Jays logging goals<br />\nor assists in the ten games played<br />\nto date. \"That says a lot for them.<br />\nThey are not selfish, (they are]<br />\nalways working for the advancement of the team. Instead of being greedy, they'll give up a shot<br />\nto someone else who might have<br />\na better angle,\" Butler said.<br />\nThe composure and teamwork<br />\nthat the Blue Jays have shown<br />\nthus far will be put to the test<br />\nSaturday night in a crucial home<br />\nmatch against Swarthmore. \"It's<br />\na seriously big game,\" Manning<br />\nsaid of this season's edition of the<br />\ntwo teams' thirty-four year old<br />\nrivalry. \"We will definitely be<br />\npumped for it.\"<br />\n\"It will be a really tough game,<br />\nwithout question, and the success<br />\nof the rest of the season hinges on<br />\nit,\" Butler agreed, emphasizing<br />\nthe importance of a spirited<br />\ncrowd.<br />\n\"Our guys are going to play as<br />\nhard as they can possibly play,<br />\nbut there is no home field advantage without the support of the<br />\nschool.\"<br />\n<br />\nthe outstretched arms of two<br />\nHopkins defenders\u2014and added a<br />\nwinning dink to put F & M within<br />\none, 11-10.

The<br />\nteams traded missed serves, as<br />\nboth sides obviously felt some<br />\npressure. \"Missed serves at the<br />\nend of the game are typical<br />\nbecause it's a very tense situation,\" said coach Jones.<br />\nHowever, a spike by Trang<br />\nPham, a dink by Suzy Yoon, and<br />\nan unforced error by F & M gave<br />\nHopkins a 15-10 triumph.<br />\nCoach Jones was very pleased<br />\nwith his team's performance.<br />\n\"I'm really happy, because in<br />\neach of the last two years we've<br />\nhad a match point against them<br />\nand we lost both games,\" he said.<br />\n\"Down the stretch, that was in<br />\nthe back of my mind.\"<br />\nThe Jays took their nine game<br />\nwinning streak into Gettysburg<br />\nlast night. \"The team has really<br />\nimproved a level,\" commented<br />\nJones. \"We blew those teams<br />\naway [during the early part of the<br />\nwinning streak], whereas last<br />\nyear it would have been a struggle.

This plan, which calls<br />\nfor three forwards, was leaving<br />\none of the wings with little to do,<br />\nwhile the other wing and the<br />\ncenter had the ball on the other<br />\nside of the field.

But for 24 of the<br />\n150 students living in The Bradford, a university-owned apartment building which offers such<br />\nluxuries as air conditioning and<br />\nwall-to-wall carpeting, the comfort and convenience they had expected turned into a disaster soon<br />\nafter they moved in.<br />\nOn September 9, at approximately 3:00 a.m., water began<br />\nto leak through the ceiling of six<br />\nof the apartments, flooding<br />\nbedrooms, bathrooms, living<br />\nrooms, and hallways. The source<br /><br />\nof the water leak was a pipe in<br />\napartment 801 that had been<br />\ndamaged.<br />\nThe pipe had been punctured<br />\nby a screw when kitchen cabinets<br />\nwere installed in the eighth floor<br />\napartment by construction<br />\nworkers earlier in this year. Continual pressure over several<br />\nweeks caused it to weaken until<br />\nfinally it burst, causing water to<br />\nleak down to the apartments as far<br />\nbelow as the third floor.<br />\nThe damage was extensive in<br />\nmost of the apartments. Water<br />\nruined the wall-to-wall carpeting<br />\nand the wooden floors beneath<br />\nand caused paint on the walls to<br />\npeel and chip. Some kitchen tiling and furniture had to be<br />\nrepaired, and ceilings needed to<br />\nbe replaced.<br />\nHopkins students living in the<br />\ndamaged Bradford apartments ex-<br /><br />\nWater leak damages Bradford Apartments.<br /><br />\nSohnia Hong<br /><br />\npressed their unhappiness with<br />\nthe way the University handled<br />\nthe incident. Evelyn Jerome, a<br />\nresident of apartment 701, expressed her frustration with the<br />\nhousing office for failing to inform students when inspectors<br />\nwould be coming to check the<br />\ndamage and when repairs would<br />\nbe made. Students complained<br />\nthat there would often be groups<br />\nof ten or twelve people walking<br />\nin and out of their apartments, yet<br />\nthey were never informed of who<br />\nthey were or why they were<br />\nthere. The Housing Office did not<br />\nrespond to letters from students<br />\nasking for explanations.<br />\nStudents also did not feel that<br />\nrepairs were made -quickly<br />\nenough. The wet carpeting was<br />\nnot removed until the following<br />\nFriday, and the walls and ceilings<br />\nwere not replaced until two weeks<br />\nafter the incident. Temporary<br />\ncarpeting was laid down the next<br />\nMonday, but the new carpeting<br />\nwill not be installed until<br />\nNovember 3.<br />\nCarol Mohr of the Housing Office stated that the University<br />\nmade every effort to respond to<br />\nthe situation as quickly as possible. \"Our major concern was<br />\nspeed,\" she said. While some<br />\ncompanies had estimated three to<br />\nfour weeks to make the repairs,<br />\nthe University insisted on having<br />\nthe major work done in two<br />\nweeks. She explained that the<br />\nnew carpeting had to be ordered<br />\nand therefore would not be<br /><br />\navailable until the end of October.<br />\nTemporary .carpeting was supplied as soon as possible,<br />\nhowever, she stated.<br />\nThe reason for the lack ofcommunication with the students, according to Mohr, was the absence<br />\nof available information at the<br />\ntime; the University had not<br />\nreceived any feedback from the<br />\nrepairmen or the insurance company about when the repairs<br />\nwould be completed.<br />\nAlthough students will still be<br />\nexpected to pay the entire rent for<br />\nthe month of September, the<br />\nHousing Office did offer to pay<br />\nSeptember's electric bill for the<br />\nstudents, who were asked to run<br />\ndehumidifiers and to leave their<br />\nair conditioners on throughout the<br />\nweek to air out the apartments.<br />\nTo some students, however,<br />\nthis is only a minimal compensation. Jerome proposed that the<br />\nstudents whose apartments were<br />\ndamaged only pay three quarters<br />\nof the month's rent of $1260, but<br />\nthe Housing Office has yet to respond to her suggestion. Mohr indicated, however, that there was<br />\nno plan on the part of the University to compensate the students<br />\naside from paying the electric<br />\nbills for September.<br />\nShe stated that \"the University cannot predict such accidents<br />\nnor prevent them from happening.'<br />\n'The administration regrets<br />\nthe inconvenience, but feels that<br />\nit did all that it could to mend the<br />\nContinued on page 2<br /><br />\nDr. David Discusses Future<br />\nOf Post-Cold War World<br />\nby Erica Gum<br />\nAddressing the issue of the<br />\n\"War &amp; Peace in the post-Cold<br />\nWar world,\" Dr. Steven David<br />\nsaid, \"I'm happy that the Cold<br />\nWar is over,\" at this week's<br />\nWednesday Noon Lecture in the<br />\nGarrett Room.<br />\nDavid, a professor of Political<br />\nScience, at the University said<br />\nthat he remains somewhat<br />\nnostalgic for the days of the Cold<br />\nWar, because it preserved peace<br />\nfor the most part.

When the two<br />\nsuperpowers conflicted, things<br />\nwere simple enough \"that Dan<br />\nQuayle \"could understand them<br />\nhe stated. The behavior of the<br />\nSoviet Union was generally stable<br />\nand predictable. The Soviet<br />\nUnion, David explained, now has<br />\nits \"capabilites largely intact, but<br />\nits intentions largely unkown.\"<br />\nDavid said that the possibilities<br />\nof a military coup, or the<br />\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union<br />\nitself cannot be ruled out. He<br />\nnoted that the Soviets still have<br />\na very large military force and a<br />\nlarge number of nuclear<br />\nweapons. He said that he would<br />\nfeel more comfortable if those'<br />\nforces were in the hands of the<br />\nKGB rather that in the hands of<br />\na crazy ethnic group. \"And I<br />\nnever thought I'd have anything<br />\nnice to say about the KGB.\"<br />\nRegarding other changes in<br />\nEurope, David said that the<br />\nemergence of democracies in<br />\nEastern Europe has also seen the<br />\nrise of ethnic hatred. David noted<br />\nthat these nations have strong armies, but not strong democratic<br />\ntraditions. A united Germany is<br />\na cause for rejoicing, according<br />\nto David, but German strength in<br />\nEurope could be destabilizing.<br />\nConcerning the third world,<br />\nDavid identified an increased<br />\nthreat to peace.

Headed by Writing<br />\nSeminars Associate Professor<br />\nMark Crispin Miller, the forum<br />\nwas created \"to improve people's<br />\nawareness of the way political ads<br />\nwork visually.\"<br />\nIn addition, the forum's goal is<br />\nto help viewers recognize the<br />\nvisual tricks and devices used to<br />\npromote and sell the candidates.<br />\nLinda Benn of the University of<br />\nMaryland's American Studies<br />\nDepartment joined Miller in what<br />\nhe referred to as the first of an<br />\n\"experimental series of discussions.\"<br />\nMuch of the hour-long forum<br />\nwas devoted to the 1988<br />\nPresidential Campaign. Miller<br />\nexplained that television campaign advertising for the<br />\nDemocrats and Republicans did<br />\nnot follow a rational format; it<br />\nwas visual rather than verbal and<br />\noperated in a more visceral way.<br />\nHe also said that these campaign<br />\nads were much more influential<br />\nthan ads for products. According<br />\nto Miller, advertising helped<br />\ndecide the presidential race in<br />\n1988.<br />\nWhile the forum followed a<br />\nbipartisan approach in analyzing<br />\ntelevision advertising, Miller and<br />\nBenn stressed the advantages<br />\npossessed by the Republican<br />\nParty. According to Benn,<br />\n\"There is a unified vision of<br />\nwholeness in the Republicans'<br />\nads.\" She added, \"Their commercials work together to create<br />\npositive images for Bush and<br /><br />\nnegative ones for Dukakis.\" Four<br />\nsuch commercials were reviewed during the forum.<br />\nBenn explained, \"Bush is<br />\nassociated with the pillar of<br />\nstrength. . . he's wearing red,<br />\nwhite, and blue. . .and exudes<br />\npurity and patriotism.\" She<br />\nnoted, however,\"No political or<br />\nfactual substance is presented in<br />\nany of these commercials.\"<br />\nMiller added, \"There is a constant association of Dukakis with<br />\nthe excremental,\" as he referred<br />\nspecifically to the Boston Harbor<br />\ncommercial. \"The Republicans<br />\nare characterized by the use of the<br />\nwords 'we,' us,\"family,' and<br />\n'hard work,' while the Democrats<br />\nare associated with 'failure,'<br />\n'taxes,'. . .'crime.\"<br />\nMiller said, however, \"The<br />\nRepublicans share a distinct advantage because the myth that<br />\nthey sell is more suitable to television than the myth the Democrats<br />\nsell.\" He added, \"The<br />\nDemocrats are cursed with a<br />\nmyth of diversity, the multiracial,<br />\nmultiplicity, fragmentation, and<br />\nuneasiness. They don't as easily<br />\nfocus on a unique characteristic<br />\nas the Republicans.\"<br />\nMiller and Benn also discussed the gubernatorial race in<br />\nCalifornia between former Congressman Pete Wilson and former<br />\nSan Francisco Mayor Diana<br />\nFeinstein, as well as the North<br />\nCarolina senate race between<br />\nJesse Helms and his black opponent Harvey Gantt.<br />\n\"The most typical negative<br />\nads,\" Miller said, \"are the most<br />\nuninteresting and the most<br />\nuneffective-the ones with an<br />\nunflattering picture of the opposContinued on page 3<br /><br />\nHopkins Ranked Fifteenth<br />\nAmong 'America's Top Colleges'<br />\nTIINI FINAL RANKIN&amp; The<br /><br />\nTop 25 National Universities<br />\nSAT ACT<br />\nOstAall<br />\nscot<br /><br />\nI.

He<br />\nargued, however, that he does not<br />\ncompletely accept the theory that<br />\ndemocracies are more peaceloving and that more democracies<br />\nmake war less likely.<br />\nAfter all, \"the American Civil<br />\nWar was fought between two<br />\ndemocracies, albeit imperfect<br />\nones,\" he said.<br />\nDavid concluded his lecture<br />\nwith a discussion of the present<br />\nPersian Gulf situation.<br />\nHe said that the US had a<br />\nlegitimate interest in keeping the<br />\noil resources of the Persian Gulf<br />\nout of Saddam Hussein's hands.<br />\nWith the invasion of Kuwait,<br />\nHussein controls 20 percent of the<br />\nworld's oil, according to David.<br />\nTwo thirds of the world's oil is<br />\nin the Persian Gulf, and if the<br />\nsupply is threatened, prices will<br />\ngo up. David said that even<br />\nthough the US only receives 10<br />\npercent of its oil from the gulf,<br />\nthe US will have to pay if the<br />\nworld oil prices increase.<br />\nDavid said that if Saddam Hussein had control over the Persian<br /><br />\nGulf oil resources, he would have<br />\nbeen able to determine the health<br />\nof the US economy, something<br />\nWashington finds unacceptable.<br />\nBut David interpreted the Iraq<br />\ncrisis as being about more than<br />\noil. According to David, it is a<br />\ntest of the post-Cold War world<br />\norder; it demonstrated that aggression will not go unpunished<br />\nAs for getting out of the crisis,<br />\nDavid said that a diplomatic solution, acceptable to Hussein,<br />\nwould still leave him in power,<br />\nstill able to threaten the othcr nations of the area. \"That's not all<br />\nthat satisfactory of an answer,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\nHe discounted the option of a<br />\nUS-sponsored military coup in<br />\nIraq. Moral and legal compunctions aside, \"We probably<br />\ncouldn't do it. We couldn't in<br />\nPanama and we had much closer<br />\nties there,\" he said. David also<br /><br />\nsaid that it might not be effective;<br />\n\"We might get Saddam Hussein<br />\nII.\"<br />\nAccording to David, a longterm American presence to provide regional security would<br />\ncause problems for the US and<br />\nfor the Arab nations, creating panArab resentment of the US.<br />\nAs for war, David said that if<br />\nwe don't fight Hussein now, we<br />\nwill probably have to fight him<br />\nlater. According to David, it will<br />\nbe worse later if he gets nuclear<br />\nweapons.<br />\nHe suggested that US action<br />\nagainst an Arab state would stir<br />\nup Arab resentment and probably<br />\nlead to terrorism.

Dean Armstrong may have to pull his statement out of the stack of administrative \"admissions\" and use<br />\nit again soon, for there is no evidence that the questions of civil<br />\n(student) rights,jurisdiction, and complicity at the heart of the<br />\nROTC \"debate\" will be intelligently or effectively addressed<br />\nby President Richardson and his fellow administrators.<br />\nDean of Students Susan Boswell is the head of the committee appointed by Richardson to \"examine the issue of ROTC<br />\nat Hopkins.\" In a prepared statement, however, Richardson<br />\nsaid that he \"does not anticipate a circumstance under which<br />\n[the University] would sever its ties with the ROTC unit.\" Why,<br />\nthen, has the committee been established, and what<br />\ncan it accomplish?<br />\nThough the precise mission of the committee is not clear,<br />\nperhaps one of its charges is to determine if there is a conflict<br />\nbetween the values and mission of the University and the<br />\nDepartment of Defense, and if this conflict interferes substantially with the rights and well-being of members of the \"Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nDepartment of Defense directive 1332.14 prohibits homosexuals from entering any branch of the armed forces. It is not<br />\nclear, however, what criteria the DoD uses to identify a<br />\n\"homosexual\" or how it upholds this directive. Recent evidence<br />\nin the media suggests that the most effective\u2014and currently the<br />\nmost \"popular\"\u2014way to be excluded from the military for being a \"homosexual\"(or because of one's current or predominant sexual preference? or one's most recent physical intimacy<br /><br />\nwith another person?) is for someone already in the military<br />\nto stand up and say \"I am gay.\" So the DoD prohibition is<br />\nenacted only after it has failed and a \"homosexual\" is serving<br />\nin the military.<br />\nWith this in mind, and using reliable national data, it is highly<br />\nprobable statistically that there are members of the Hopkins<br />\nROTC program who identify themselves as \"homosexuals.\"<br />\nThere are administrators, faculty and staff members, and many<br />\nstudents (500? 750? 1000?) who fall into the category<br />\n\"homosexual\" as the DoD seems to use it. If so, there is nothing<br />\nto investigate\u2014discrimination on the basis of \"homosexuality\" affects members of the Hopkins community.<br />\nDoes the committee intend to investigate the positive versus<br />\nnegative impact of having ROTC on our campus? There is no<br />\nway to measure the benefits enjoyed by a small number of<br />\nHopkins students who participate in ROTC against the harm<br />\ncaused by discrimination. The benefits of ROTC are not being<br />\nchallenged. And many Hopkins students acquire financial aid<br />\nand leadership skills without the \"help\" of ROTC.<br />\nAcross the country, colleges and universities are taking<br />\ndefinitive action to protest DoD policies and university complicity. Within the next two years, students at Harvard who<br />\nare members of an ROTC battalion at other campuses will no<br />\nlonger be allowed to use ROTC funds for their Harvard education. (Harvard does not have its own ROTC program.) This<br />\naction, and actions like it, exert whatever influence possible<br />\nover the DoD while protecting the rights of the students.<br />\nHarvard ROTC cadets will have to look for either alternative<br />\nfunds or an alternative school. But no student at Harvard will<br />\nwonder about her or his status because of her or his private<br />\nlife. Hopkins students, faculty, staff, and administrators deserve<br />\nthe same. They also deserve more than a perfunctory presidential committee with no charge other than to rubber-stamp<br />\nRichardson's unwillingness to take action on behalf of the<br />\nmembers of this University community.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nIn Which the Administration Learns 'Who Is Complaining',<br />\nA Response to Dr. Gryder, Scientists, Activists, Differences<br />\nTo the Editors:<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br /><br />\nI was deeply disturbed upon<br />\nreading last week's edition of the<br />\nNews-Letter, in which various administrators directly or indirectly<br />\ndefended their inexcusable lack of<br />\naction on the ROTC issue. I was not<br />\namazed to find that President<br />\nRichardson justifies his lack of com-'<br />\nmittment to the issue by upholding<br />\na conclusively ineffective letter sent<br />\nfive months ago to Dick Cheney and<br />\nan ad hoc committee, which will<br />\nmerely \"prepare a report for<br />\nRichardson about ROTC at<br />\nHopkins\" but will not have any<br />\nundergraduate representation nor<br />\nany power over the final decision on<br />\nHopkins policy. This stance is<br />\nnothing less than an attempt to put<br />\noff the issue in an extremely<br />\nbureaucratic way, in hope that the<br />\nmost vocal of the \"complainers\"<br />\nwill go away.<br />\nThis raises the most important<br />\nquestion, presented last week as<br />\n\"Who is complaining?\" The<br />\nparagraphs that follow were simply<br />\nappalling. In them, Dean Armstrong, Bob Nelson, and Estelle<br />\nFishbein stated that the issue has<br />\nseldom or never been brought to<br />\ntheir attention by students. In other<br />\nwords, campus apathy is a sufficient<br />\nreason to ignore a vitally important<br />\nissue. Listen, if we waited for<br />\nstudents to raise a mob of protest for<br />\nevery issue that concerned them,<br />\nmost issues would never be addressed. It's a commonplace phenomenon<br />\nhere at Hopkins\u2014not enough people<br />\ntake the time to show their support<br />\nfor what they believe in, and virtually none put forth the effort to fight<br />\nthe constant bureaucratic sedation in<br />\norder to make the essential changes.<br />\nI know that support exists for this<br />\nissue. Thankfully, someone has<br />\nfinally emerged from the student<br />\nbody who is willing to lead the fight<br />\nagainst the administration's<br />\nhypocracy. But we must all show<br />\nthat we care enough to force a<br />\nchange. We are being excluded from<br />\nthe outcome of this debate because<br />\nthe administration thinks we are one<br />\nman with a few enthusiastic letterwriters in his wake. We are indeed<br />\n3000, and we must not let ourselves<br />\nbe discounted as an apathetic mass<br />\nwith no opinion. Dr. Richardson<br />\nwould like nothing better than to let<br />\nthe students lose whatever enthusiasm<br />\nthey now feel, allowing him to deal<br />\nwith the issue as he chooses; i.e.,<br />\nthere will be no change.<br />\nWe all know what the issue is.

The Department<br />\nof Defense's exclusionary policy<br />\nagainst gays and lesbians in ROTC<br />\nunits is antithetical to the spirit and<br />\nletter of the University's stance<br />\nagainst discrimination. Yet, President Richardson, who in other<br />\nvenues has expressed his belief in the<br />\nhumanistic values of the institution,<br />\nsays he \"does not anticipate a circumstance under which the<br />\nUniversity would sever its ties with<br />\nthe ROTC unit.\" With his decision<br />\non the issue apparently made,<br />\nRichardson is still going through the<br />\ncharade of appointing a committee<br />\non the ROTC issue, to be chaired by<br />\nDean of Students Susan Boswell,<br />\nwhen Boswell has said herself, in the<br />\nSeptember 28th News-Letter, that<br />\n\"direction (on the ROTC issue) will<br />\ncome from the President.\" The<br />\nPresident has set his direction it<br />\nseems, and it is time for those who<br />\nbelieve discrimination can play no<br />\nrole on this campus to set our own.<br />\nEqually disturbing in last week's<br />\narticle was the writer's rhetorical<br />\nquestion about who is raising all the<br />\nfuss about gays and lesbians in<br />\nROTC in the first place. Dean Armstrong, Estelle Fishbein, University<br />\nGeneral Counsel, and Bob Nelson,<br /><br />\nStudent Council President, are<br />\nquoted that they have heard little or<br />\nno direct protest on the issue. The<br />\nclear implication is that if no one is<br />\ncomplaining, nothing is wrong, and<br />\nnothing needs to be done. This \"let's<br />\nnot rock the boat\" if we're not sinking philosophy may be fine when it<br />\ncomes to issues like a student union,<br />\ncourse offerings and the like, but it<br />\nis morally incompatible with clearcut issues of discrimination.<br />\nMoreover, has anyone realized that<br />\ngay and lesbian students in ROTC<br />\nmay not be complaining for fear of<br />\nlosing scholarships in the program?<br />\nAdmittedly, Paul DelGrosso, President of GALA,has raised this issue,<br />\nbut by no means should this be seen<br />\nas GALA's struggle alone.

No one expected him<br />\nto make Avalon. Avalon is a sad<br />\nand nostalgic slice of life, following the growth and decay of a<br />\nBaltimorean immigrant family<br />\nthrough our rapidly-changing<br />\ncentury.<br />\nThe film begins with Sam, one<br />\nof the four Kyrchinsky brothers,<br />\nnarrating the lyrical memory of<br />\nhis arrival in the port-town of<br />\nBaltimore in 1914. There are<br />\nfireworks careening in the sky,<br />\nelectric lights, and flags and banners whipping in the wind. He arrives at Avalon, the family's<br />\nAmerican home in the city, where<br />\nhe and his brothers run a<br />\nwallpapering business, and play<br />\nconcert violins on the side. One<br />\nnight, in the softly-flickering light<br />\nof a dancehall, he falls in love.<br />\nBut these, as we see, are Sam's<br /><br />\nmemories, told many times to travel, it sets up a chain of petbefore to his grandchildren.

Disappear Fear also dedicated their<br />\nset to Florida record store<br />\nowner Charles Freeman, who<br />\nwas convicted of obscenity the<br />\nday before for selling a 2 Live<br />\nCrew album; appropriately,<br /><br />\nwas effectively lightened, she<br />\nalso projected an aura oF<br />\npretentiousness, a trait that has<br />\nalways detracted from her<br />\notherwise well-crafted records.<br />\nVega didn't often look excited on the Shriver Hall stage,<br />\nbut excitement isn't too big a<br />\npart of the coffeehouse-folk<br />\nmusic that has shaped her<br />\ncareer. he looked most in-<br /><br />\nSuzanne Vega's performance was<br />\nfairly predictable: it was ideal for<br />\nher fans, and might win over<br />\ncasual listeners, but her critics<br />\nwould find little convincing<br />\nmaterial.<br />\ntwo of the band's songs during the set addressed free<br />\nspeech and censorship.<br />\nAfter a short break, Vega<br />\ntook the stage with her fourpiece backing band and began<br />\nan eighteen-song set divided<br />\ninto electric, acoustic, and solo<br />\nparts. Best was the solo portion, the highlights of which<br />\nwere \"Neighborhood Girls\"<br />\nand \"Knight Moves.\" Vega<br />\npunctuated the set with several<br />\nstories; while some of her<br />\njokes were funny and the mood<br /><br />\n_<br />\nPlisse Takara<br /><br />\nSuzanne Vega leaves her acoustic guitar behind and takes the mic<br />\nalone.<br /><br />\nterested by \"Marlene On The<br />\nWall\" and \"The Queen and<br />\nthe Soldier\" (the first encore),<br />\nseemed bothered by the virtual<br />\nobligation to play \"Luka,\"<br />\nand appeared uncomfortable<br />\nwhen singing without her<br />\nacoustic guitar. Her most active composition, the folkrocking \"Left Of Center,\"<br />\nallowed the band to escape<br />\ntheir session-musician backing<br />\nroles and breathe more life into<br />\nthe performance.<br />\nThe only glimpse the audience got of Vega's true personality (besides the stories,<br />\nwhich she tells almost every<br />\nnight) occurred during the<br />\na capella encore \"Tom's<br />\nDiner,\" in which she forgot<br />\nthe third verse while attempting to lead a Shriver-sized<br />\nsing-a-long. Vega laughed,<br />\ntried vainly to cover with a<br />\njoke, and blushed. It was the<br />\nonly time she seemed truly<br />\nhuman during the show, and<br />\nwhile she atoned with an atmospheric rendition of<br />\n\"Wooden Horse\" for the<br />\nfinale, the goof was ironically<br />\nthe most telling moment in the<br />\nperformance.<br />\nSuzanne Vega's performance was fairly predictable:<br />\nit was ideal for her fans, and<br />\nmight win over casual<br />\nlisteners, but her critics would<br />\nfind little convincing material,<br />\nespecially since the performances were mostly replications of album tracks for the<br />\nstage. Although parts of her set<br />\ncould scarcely escape a critical<br />\neye, Vega was mostly effective<br />\nand quite enjoyable, if a little<br />\ngloomy. The trouble was that<br />\nVega was more impressed<br />\nwith herself than this reviewer<br />\nwas with her.<br /><br />\nwith<br />\nfamily<br />\nKyrchinsky<br />\nremarkable charm and accuracy.<br />\nThe characters are so interesting<br />\nand likeable, that there are long<br />\nstretches when the camera sits on<br />\nthem as they talk amongst each<br />\nother, without any change whatsoever. And, unlike many conversations in real life, these<br />\ndialogues are still interesting to<br />\nwatch after minutes. We become<br />\nattached to these characters, and<br />\ntheir struggle, to continue as a<br />\nfamily in the face of rapid<br />\nchange, becomes our struggle.<br />\nExcept that we are looking back,<br />\nseeing their mistakes before they<br />\nmake them. It makes our sadness<br />\nat having lost Avalon forever all<br />\nthe more profound.<br />\nPerformances in the film are<br />\nstrong. Armin Mueller-Stahl<br />\nplays Sam as the lively,<br />\nthoughtful family leader who watches his relatives become distant,<br />\nand Aidan Quinn is his son Jules,<br />\nswept up in his own ambitions for<br />\nsuccess in business. Equally<br />\nstrong are Elizabeth Perkins as<br />\nJules' wife, who despairs of the<br />\nlimitations the family places on<br />\nthem, and Joan Plowright as<br />\nSam's nagging wife whose portrayal is beautifully honest.

It is the<br />\nstory of Eugene Debs Hartke and<br />\nhis involvement in a massive<br />\nprison breakout in fictional<br />\nicipio, New York. Hocus Pocus<br />\n%amines themes long familiar to<br />\n'onnegut fans; free-will, finding<br />\naDurpose in an absurd universe,<br />\nad adapting to change.

But this<br />\nfreedom has dangerous consequences as well.<br />\nThroughout the Hartke narrative, Vonnegut describes his<br />\nown dystopic vision of the future.<br />\nHe takes certain aspects of<br />\nAmerican society during the '80s<br />\nand depicts the sort of society into<br />\nwhich these aspects might<br />\ndevelop by 2001, where the<br />\nstorytelling takes place. And as<br />\nVonnegut describes it, the United<br />\nStates of 2001 is pretty much a<br />\nbuzz-kill: \"If all had gone the<br />\nway a lot of people thought it<br />\nwould, Jesus Christ would have<br /><br />\nbetween ideas. The scraps don't<br />\nseem enough like scraps to me.<br />\nThey seem too coherent as individual pieces, too consistent in<br />\nquality to be written on loose<br />\npieces.

That's why it's<br />\nso refreshing to hear these new<br />\nrecordings, courtesy of producer<br />\nHal Willner and Island Records.<br />\nTheir writing and speaking styles<br />\nstand in sharp contrast, but they<br />\nwill be forever linked by the<br />\nghost of their generation.<br />\nBurroughs himself even sounds<br />\nlike a ghost on Dead City Radio.<br />\nHis seventy-six-year-old voice<br />\ndoesn't sound a day over eighty<br />\nas his angry recitations suggest a<br />\nlonely old man, living out his last<br /><br />\ndays and hating the world. \"What<br />\nare you here for?\" he bellows to<br />\nopen the album. \"We're all here<br />\nto go, that's what we're here<br />\nfor.\" Burroughs stumbles<br />\nthrough the material, spitting out<br />\ntelling asides and satirizing<br />\neverything from Thanksgiving<br />\ndinner to the Bible.<br />\nProducer Willner went to Burroughs' house in Lawrence, Kansas, and recorded Burroughs<br />\nreading excerpts from his books<br />\nand other writings as well as<br />\nvarious conversations and stories.<br />\nBurroughs reads from The<br />\nNaked Lunch, The Western<br />\nLands, Tornado Alley, and<br />\nothers; he even takes on the Bible in the three-part \"Sermon On<br />\nThe Mount\" and a reading of the<br />\nLord's Prayer.<br />\nMeanwhile,\"A Thanksgiving<br />\nPrayer\" and \"Ah Pook The<br /><br />\nDestroyer/Brion Gysin's AllPurpose Bedtime Story\" attack<br />\nflag-waving Americans for gross<br />\nexcesses and false patriotic traditions. Burroughs closes with a<br />\nbizarre, apparently drunken stab<br />\nat \"Falling In Love Again,\" sung<br />\nin German and accompanied by<br />\na quiet piano and clarinet.<br />\nMuch of the album's music<br />\ncomes from the archives of NBC<br />\nstudios, as Willner employs<br />\nthirty-year-old recordings of the<br />\nNBC Symphony Orchestra to<br />\ntremendously successful effect,<br />\noften satirical but generally<br />\nenhancing Burroughs' ancient,<br />\nbrilliant voice. Also included are<br />\nSonic Youth (not playing music<br />\nbut making atmospheric feedback<br />\nsounds), John Cale, and Donald<br />\nFagen, whose old band, Steely<br />\nDan, took its name from The<br />\nNaked Lunch.

The sixty-threeyear-old Ginsberg's voice, not<br />\nnearly as grizzled as Burroughs',<br />\nis more nasal, higher in pitch, and<br />\ndisplays more emotional range,<br />\noften bemused and rarely as<br />\nserious and poetic as the stark text<br />\nwould seem to imply. Original<br />\njazz compositions by Marc Ribot,<br />\nBill Frisell, Gary Windo,<br />\nMichael Blair, and Lenny Pickett<br />\n(among others) serve as the backing tracks for Ginsberg's poetry<br />\nreadings; G.E. Smith and Rob<br />\nWasserman also play in the allstar cast.<br />\n\"Complaint of the Skeleton to<br />\nTime\" is an odd, humorous item,<br />\naccompanied by Windo's bonerattling free jazz track; \"Xmas<br />\nGift\" tells of a vision of meeting<br />\nEinstein on a lawn at Princeton.<br />\n1958's \"To Aunt Rose\" and<br />\n\"The Lion For Real,\" the bestknown poems on the album, are<br />\nserved well; lesser-known items<br />\nfrom his Collected Poems are a<br />\nbit more uneven. The most<br />\nunusual is a CD bonus track,<br />\n\"C'mon Jack,\" a brief homosexual fantasy set to a smarmy accompaniment by Steve Swallow.<br />\nGinsberg's liner notes are a big<br />\nhelp, as is the text of the poems<br />\nthemselves, printed on the sleeve.<br />\nAlthough some of the poems are<br />\nlyri,cal in nature, Ginsberg shuns<br />\nsinging for recitation, as he puts<br />\nit, \"relieved to leave music to the<br />\nhonorable musicians.\"<br />\nIt's a bit strange in 1990 to hear<br />\ntwo elder statesmen like Ginsberg<br />\nand Burroughs on compact disc,<br />\nbut it makes sense. Burroughs has<br />\nbeen called a godfather of punk,<br />\nand Ginsberg worked alongside<br />\nSixties icons like Bob Dylan and<br />\nLou Reed, as well as with the<br />\nClash.

With Love Is<br />\nStrange, Rogers has glided onto<br />\na new, impressively barren plane.<br />\nThis is a musical universe that<br />\nallows for no variation, a place<br />\nwhere emotion collapses into an<br />\nantiseptic infinity of lyrics with<br />\nas much personality as an average<br />\nclump of astroturf.<br />\nBut is this country music? It<br />\nmight not be fair to pigeonhole<br />\nthe man who gave the world<br />\n\"The Gambler,\" \"Lady,\" and<br />\nmy favorite, \"Coward of \u2022 the<br />\nCounty.\" Love Is Strange contains none of the things that I<br />\nassociate with good country<br />\nmusic\u2014small-town tales, occasionally cheesy but heartfelt instrumental work, lyrics that explore bizarre but functional<br />\nrelationships\u2014except its traditional brand of cutesy sexism,<br /><br />\nwhich is in abundant evidence.<br />\nNot all of the songs are predictable, but those that aren't (like<br />\nthe nauseous \"If! Were A Painting\")are so third-grade insightful<br />\nthat, after fifteen seconds, you'll<br />\nbe aching to hear an instrumental \u2014which you won't.<br />\nIt's not just that Love Is Strange<br />\nis stupid: there isn't any music<br />\nhere. You can hear occasional<br />\ntraces of melody\u2014it hums on the<br />\nedge of the mix, like the sound<br />\ntrapped inside a sea shell\u2014but as<br />\nGertrude Stein once said in<br />\nanother context, \"There isn't any<br />\nthere there.\" Rogers has a voice<br />\nwhich is two parts fuzzy warmth<br />\nand no part human: he seems convinced that singing each line as<br />\nif he has just exhausted his oxygen supply will make an emotional statement. It doesn't.<br />\nTo make the point, however,<br />\nrecall the commercials Rogers did<br />\nrecently for Dole, which are<br />\nperhaps his most memorable<br />\nwork in years.

Ro<br />\nTruman Capote once said that<br />\nlove is a matter of concentration.<br />\nTo win over the objects of one's<br />\ndevotion, one simply focuses on<br />\nhim or her, using all the subtle<br />\npowers and unspoken communication to draw their attention. To paraphrase his own<br />\nwords, no one can resist being admired, and so Capote supposedly placed his greatest faith in flattery. Certainly no writer has done<br />\nit better and more enchantingly<br />\nthan Capote, whose words and<br />\nmemories are recreated onstage<br />\nin Tru. Robert Morse is the actor<br />\nwho delivers an exacting performance that seems to resurrect the<br />\npersona of a true American<br />\neccentric.<br />\nThe play begins in December<br />\nof 1975, with Capote recalling<br />\njovially, telephone in hand, in his<br />\napartment in New York. He is<br />\ngossiping with (and flattering)<br />\none of his jet-set compadres. The<br />\ndoorbell rings and Capote puts<br />\ndown the phone and runs gleefully to greet the unexpected visitor.<br />\nIt is, in fact, a monstrous arrangement of poinsettias, laughably<br />\ngaudy. This provides Capote the<br />\nopportunity to bash the gist deftly with his disdainful wit and<br />\nentertain his friend at the same<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe rest of the play is a series<br />\nof monologues punctuated by<br />\nmore telephone calls and<br />\nflashbacks. In one moment, he is<br />\ntelling the audience about a book<br />\nhe wrote about convicts, which<br />\nreminds him of trip to Taiwan, of<br />\ndogs in cages, and then he's on<br />\nthe phone again with his manager<br />\nnegotiating a deal on his next<br />\nbook. It's stream of consciousness, but with a structure<br />\nthat is given color by Capote's<br />\nseemingly aimless progress of<br />\nthought. He discusses his enormpus circle of wealthy friends,<br /><br />\nand how little he cares for them.<br />\nHe effuses with the joy of<br />\nChristmas, yet reveals a tragic<br />\nevent from his past that will<br />\nforever ruin it for him. He comments on love, true friendship,<br />\nand ostracism. While there is no<br />\nreal story-line, each monologue<br />\nserves as an independent story in<br /><br />\nNo writer has<br />\nexploited flattery<br />\nbetter and more<br />\nenchantingly than<br />\nCapote, whose<br />\nwords and<br />\nmemories are<br />\nrecreated onstage<br />\nin Tru, playing<br />\nthrough October<br />\n28 at the<br />\nMechanic.<br />\nits own right. Taken together,<br />\nthey all point to the man who tells<br />\nthem, lending insight, evoking<br />\nsympathy, and linking themselves<br />\ninto one psychologically coherent<br />\nwhole. In short, it seems as<br />\nthough everything that ever affected Capote, and anything you<br />\nmay have wanted to know about<br /><br />\nhim, is treated in this tribute,<br />\nwhich is a credit to writerdirector Jay Allen Pressman.<br />\nBut for those not familiar with<br />\nCapote, and the endless number<br />\nof articles printed about him both<br />\nduring and after his lifetime, the<br />\ninside jokes may be lost on you.<br />\nMost of the baby-boomers in the<br />\naudience laughed robustly, but<br />\nyounger viewers may find<br />\nthemselves garnering chuckles<br />\nonly from the slapsticks and<br />\nCalifornia jokes.<br />\nSignificantly, Pressman glosses<br />\nover Capote's fall from the<br />\ntrusted and acclaimed echelons of<br />\nhigh society, perhaps counting<br />\nagain on the audience's familiarity. Nevertheless, it remains a<br />\nsubject in need of deeper treatment. Capote was at work on<br />\nAnswered Prayers, a semiautobiographical book, at the<br />\ntime this play is set. In the month<br />\nprevious, Esquire had printed a<br />\nchapter from his book and, just<br />\nshort of lynching the rich, the excerpt had revealed their \"sexual<br />\nlicense and ethical squalor\" with<br />\nall the names changed.<br />\nThe play supposedly begins<br />\nwith Capote suffering amidst the<br />\naftermath of his tattle-telling, but<br />\ndevotes little time recounting the<br />\nevent, much less explaining it.<br />\nWe simply see him alone this<br />\nholiday season, searching his<br />\nthoughts for a mental escape from<br />\nhis imposed ostracism. Another<br />\ngap in Capote's life here is the<br />\nperiod in which he metamorphosized from the sad, desperate<br />\nchild into the radiantly successful<br />\nartist. It's a notable flaw, as the<br />\nplay is geared for revelations and<br />\naudience-character empathy.<br />\nRobert Morse does a wonderful job performing Truman<br />\nCapote. And it is truly performing. In all fairness, that is what<br />\nthe role requires: a sense of<br />\nshowmanship and a flair for comic gestures.

In<br />\nwhat they had hoped would be a<br />\ntypical eleven vs. eleven soccer<br />\nmatch, the visiting Blue Jays<br />\nfound instead a \"lopsided\" game<br />\nthat included both officials and<br />\nDickinson players on the home<br />\nteam roster.<br />\n\"The cards wouldn't have been<br />\nthat unusual if the refs had called the game evenly. But when<br />\nyour team gets seven yellows and<br />\nthey get none, you have to<br />\nwonder,\" said senior co-captain<br />\nGeoff Manning.<br />\nWarren Jones, the other<br />\nHopkins co-captain and recipient<br />\nof the game's only red card,<br />\nagreed. \"The refereeing was<br />\nridiculous. They weren't carding<br />\nat all for physical fouls, but they<br />\ndid for moronic reasons [like talking to officials].\"<br />\nIndeed, the referees accepted<br />\nno lobbying from the Blue Jays,<br />\nfirst slapping Jones with a yellow<br />\nwarning card in a dispute over the<br />\nten-yard free kick zone, then with<br />\na red card for applauding a call<br />\nlater in the game. \"I guess the ref<br />\nthought I was being sarcastic or<br />\nsomething, but even then I<br />\nshouldn't have been carded for<br />\nit,\" Jones explained.<br />\nJones and Manning were quick<br />\nto admit, though, that the officiating was not the only factor<br />\nbarring a Hopkins win. The Blue<br />\nJays set the tempo and stayed<br />\nwith their game plan, but<br />\nsquandered numerous scoring opportunities, Manning said. Early in the first game, senior mid-<br /><br />\nfielder Rich Bronshvag capitalized on classmate Andrew Janis'<br />\npass to net Hopkins' only goal.<br />\n\"We have had the same problem throughout the season,\"<br />\nJones explained.\"We go out and<br />\nscore early and then relax, thinking we've got the game won.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays paid dearly for<br />\nthe lapse, struggling through two<br />\novertimes before finally ending<br />\nthe game in a draw. \"That kind<br />\nof game gets you fired up, but it's<br />\nalso frustrating. It makes you<br />\nwant to go right back out there<br />\nand play again,\" Jones said.<br />\nDespite the frustration, the<br />\nBlue Jays were able to call on<br />\ntheir positive attitude to carry<br />\nthem into the next game, said<br />\nhead coach Mark Butler. \"The<br />\nteam is able to recognize that on<br />\nany given day something could<br />\nhappen that is beyond their power<br />\nto control.. .it could just be their<br />\nopponent's lucky day, so this<br />\ndoesn't affect them very much.\"<br />\nIf anything, the players channeled their frustration toward a<br />\nsound defeat of Western<br />\nMaryland on Tuesday afternoon<br />\nin Lancaster. Though the chief<br />\ndifference between the two games<br />\nwas \"clearly the officiating,\"<br />\nManning said, the Blue Jays also<br />\nshowed exceptional control in adjusting their game plan to fit the<br />\nhost team's physical style.<br />\n\"We were very casual and<br />\nworked the ball well. Because of<br />\ntheir short field, we were able to<br />\nsit back in a defensive posture and<br />\ncontrol the game from our own<br />\nhalf of the field,\" Manning explained, crediting Butler with a<br />\nshrewd change in strategy.<br />\nBronshvag again led the Blue<br />\nJay attack, scoring the team's first<br />\ngoal 22 minutes into the game on<br />\na pass from junior midfielder<br />\nMyles Flynn. The Green Terror<br />\nstruck back ten minutes later to<br />\ntie the score, but this time<br />\n\u2022 Hopkins did not relax.<br />\nSophomore defenseman Mike<br />\nVandekieft set up senior forward<br />\nTodd Marshall just two minutes<br />\nlater, to give Hopkins a 2-1 edge<br /><br />\nat half-time.<br />\nIn the second half, Vandekieft<br />\nagain took charge, making a<br />\nbrilliant run down the sideline and<br />\ndrawing a foul inside the penalty<br />\nbox. Bronshvag scored on the ensuing penalty kick to seal the 3-1<br />\nvictory.<br />\nButler complimented the play<br />\nof his reserves, who were called<br />\nupon to fill in gaps left by Janis<br />\nand Jones, respectively sidelined<br />\nwith an injury and a red card<br />\nfrom the previous game. \"They<br />\nwere up for the challenge, but I<br />\nexpected it of them,\" Butler commented. \"I am never concerned<br />\nabout putting any one player in<br />\nbecause I know they'll adjust and<br />\ndo what we need them to do.<br />\n\"Recently Nick Martin has<br />\nbeen our most stable player,\" he<br />\ncontinued. \"We can always count<br />\non him to do his job. But really,<br />\nthe whole team collectively stands<br />\nout.\"<br />\nScoring has been remarkably<br />\nspread out this season, with ten<br />\ndifferent Blue Jays logging goals<br />\nor assists in the ten games played<br />\nto date. \"That says a lot for them.<br />\nThey are not selfish, (they are]<br />\nalways working for the advancement of the team. Instead of being greedy, they'll give up a shot<br />\nto someone else who might have<br />\na better angle,\" Butler said.<br />\nThe composure and teamwork<br />\nthat the Blue Jays have shown<br />\nthus far will be put to the test<br />\nSaturday night in a crucial home<br />\nmatch against Swarthmore. \"It's<br />\na seriously big game,\" Manning<br />\nsaid of this season's edition of the<br />\ntwo teams' thirty-four year old<br />\nrivalry. \"We will definitely be<br />\npumped for it.\"<br />\n\"It will be a really tough game,<br />\nwithout question, and the success<br />\nof the rest of the season hinges on<br />\nit,\" Butler agreed, emphasizing<br />\nthe importance of a spirited<br />\ncrowd.<br />\n\"Our guys are going to play as<br />\nhard as they can possibly play,<br />\nbut there is no home field advantage without the support of the<br />\nschool.\"<br /><br />\nthe outstretched arms of two<br />\nHopkins defenders\u2014and added a<br />\nwinning dink to put F &amp; M within<br />\none, 11-10.

However, the Blue<br />\nJays managed to stay close<br />\nthrough six innings, mostly<br />\nbehind the pitching of sophomore<br />\nJoe Tortorello.<br />\nTortorello allowed just two<br />\nruns in his six innings of work.<br />\n\"He mixed speed well, kept them<br />\noff balance,\" coach Andy Karetsky said of his pitcher's performance. \"He had them out on<br />\ntheir front foot all night.\"<br />\nNumerous overanxious Oriole<br />\nbatters popped up due to his baffling change of pace.<br />\nTortorello, only scheduled to<br />\npitch six innings, was relieved in<br />\nthe top of the seventh inning trailing 2-1 by senior Dave Kiskis.<br />\nKiskis was peppered for six runs<br />\nin two-thirds of an inning of<br />\nwork. His tendency to keep the<br />\nball up in the strike zone caused<br />\nmuch of the problem. He was<br /><br />\nsubsequently relieved by junior<br />\nMike Metz who pitched one and<br />\none third innings before giving<br />\nway to senior Ken Brodkowitz in<br />\nthe ninth.<br />\nOn the other side of home<br />\nplate, Hopkins' batters struggled<br />\nwith a higher caliber of pitcher<br />\nthan they are used to. The Orioles<br />\npitching staff, feeding the Blue<br />\nJays a steady diet of 80 mile per<br />\nhour fastballs and hard sliders,<br />\nallowed just four hits. One hit<br />\nthough, was a bomb, accounting<br />\nfor the Blue Jays' only run. In the<br />\ntop of the third inning junior second baseman Mike Frazier<br />\nblasted a solo homerun deep over<br />\nthe left field wall to give Hopkins<br />\nits only lead, 1-0.<br />\n\"Our hitters were completely<br />\noutmatched,\" said Karetsky.<br />\n\"We don't see that quality of pitching ever.\"<br />\nHopkins' pitcher Rob Walter<br />\nechoed those sentiments. \"Their<br />\npitching outmatched us. We<br />\nhaven't seen anyone that speed<br />\nand our players aren't hitting the<br />\nball like they will be in the<br />\nspring,\" he said.<br />\n\"We didn't know what to expect coming in,\" Karetsky added, \"but!think we made a good<br />\nshowing. This is the only outside<br />\ncompetition we face so it was a<br />\ngood chance to see our whole first<br />\nunit play together.\" When asked for an evaluation of the team<br />\nat this point Karetsky stated simpinexperly,<br />\n\"We're<br />\nienced but good.\"<br />\nIt seems that some of those<br />\nfreshmen accounting for the inexperience are moving to the<br />\nforeground in the battle for the<br />\nvarsity spots in the spring.<br />\nSmooth fielding shortstop Joe<br />\nKail, second baseman Mike<br />\nArenth and pitcher Ryan Rippen<br />\nreceived mention for their steady<br />\nplay this fall.<br /><br />\nBIA NOTES<br />\nby Arthur Young<br /><br />\nend, linebacker, and center.<br />\nBut they did find three guys to<br />\nplay quarterback, receiver,<br />\nand safety.
