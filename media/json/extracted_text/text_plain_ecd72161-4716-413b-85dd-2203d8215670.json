These<br />\nathletics boys are slippery and elusive; but there's<br />\nsome consolation in the fact that we scared them<br />\ninto showing their real hand.<br />\nThe hand is this: they have to be continually<br />\nridden by the students before they can be depended upon to do their jobs efficiently. One of<br />\nthe members of the Athletic Council, a high University official, said a very significant thing when<br />\nhe recommended to the 0. D. K. committee, which<br />\nrecently protested before the Council that the<br />\ncaptains and managers of the teams were the logical ones to complain when the coach and financial<br />\nmanager neglected to supply enough equipment<br />\nand coaching talent. It seems to show the attitude<br />\nof the authorities \u2014 that continual prodding is<br />\nthe only way to secure decent treatment from the<br />\nathletic department.<br />\n<br />\nBut It's Strikingly Flimsy<br />\nBut though the officials have escaped the terrain which we beseiged they have very naively<br />\nleft themselves in open ground and entirely defenseless before some of our more important<br />\ncharges. They spiel off glibly that so many uniforms have been ordered here, so much money<br />\nappropriated there, that necessary economies forced<br />\nthe dropping of Mallonee as assistant coach. But<br />\nwe want to know why the money wasn't spent before? The money was available last year and yet<br />\nit wasn't spent. How do we know that the same<br />\nthing won't happen next year? Is it an indication<br />\nof competence on the part of an athletic administration which has to be dragged by the nose to do<br />\nthe obvious? We believe emphatically that it is<br />\nnot. The squirming of the department under the<br />\ncross-fire which has afflicted it for the past three<br />\nweeks is to us too much of an admission of guilt.<br />\nIts almost frenzied efforts to prove that it is doing what is needful have left us skeptical of its<br />\npower of self-motivation after the pressure is<br />\nremoved. The clam-like nature of its attitude toward every decent question we ask is becoming<br />\nIt is not apparent that there is any need for<br />\neconomies such as were introduced last year,<br />\nnamely, the cutting of Mallonee and of training<br />\ntable. Particularly when nearly $500 of the appropriation was not spent and when we are supporting a coach on a vastly disproportionate salary.<br />\nJust what sort of reasoning, we wonder, does the<br />\nathletic department think we follow? The gaping<br />\nholes in its defense would accomodate the coachand-four of the old adage.<br />\n<br />\nSo It Won't Do<br />\nSo far, gentlemen, you haven't come across<br />\nwith anything that amounts to anything. We'll<br />\nhave to insist on more concrete evidence of good<br />\nintentions. If we don't get it now we may never<br />\nget it, because there's no assurance that there will<br />\nalways be the freedom of criticism which we experience at present nor the coincidence of cit cumstances which makes this a particularly appropriate time to demand an accounting.<br />\n<br />\nSoothing Prospect<br />\nWriting editorials on campus problems, if we<br />\nmay dignify our brawls as such, engenders a sort of<br />\nsour outlook on the goodness of humanity as an applied principle. But we see some redeeming feature;<br />\nat least somebody concurs with our ideas of good<br />\nsense.

However,<br />\nin the modern version of Browning's immortal<br />\ntale, only a small percentage of Baltimore's rats<br />\nare captured; and, as far as the Hopkins is concerned, the countless rodent denizens of the University<br />\ncontinue to gambol on the green in complete<br />\nsecurity.<br />\nAs an example of the small scale upon which<br />\nthe hunting operations by the United States Quarantine Station at Curtis Bay are carried on in<br />\nBaltimore, only 300 rats were caught on a recent<br />\npeak day of the campaign now under way. But<br />\nin the face of this Dr. H. F. White, director of the<br />\nsurvey, has declared that \"The showing thus far<br />\nis very gratifying and demonstrates quite expert<br />\ntrapping by men with no experience.\"<br />\nNevertheless, even though the scope of the survey's operations be increased, the rats of our campus will undoubtedly remain unmolested. With<br />\nthis prospect in view, the suggestion has been<br />\nmade that the National Student League insert a<br />\nplank in their platform demanding a governmental<br />\nboard to execute an \"anti-rat\" movement, perhaps<br />\nsimilar to that now in use in France, where the<br />\nParis police are directing a drive against rats.<br />\nThere the Prefecture maintains a special service<br />\nof \"deratization,\" which has been especially active<br />\nduring the past year, having carried out anti-rat<br />\noffensives in 1,015 places in Paris and the suburbs.<br />\nBut something must indeed be done here, for<br />\nrats abound on the campus. They are especially<br />\nnumerous around Gilman Hall, and a student recently reported seeing one the size of a full-grown<br />\nmuskrat, strolling across the road at the south end<br />\nof the automobile tunnel. And they abound around the<br />\noutside of Alumni Memorial Hall\u2014\"Great rats, small<br />\nrats, lean rats, scrawny rats, brown rats, black rats,<br />\ngray rats, tawny rats, grave old plodders, gay<br />\nyoung friskers, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,<br />\ncocking tails and pricking whiskers, and families<br />\nby tens and dozens.\"<br />\n<br />\nCampus Brevities<br />\nUntil activities stop charging prices above the<br />\nS.

C. card signed by Stern in<br />\nhis official capacity says that the holder of the<br />\ncard is to get, among other things, a copy of the<br />\nHullabaloo \"without further charge\". That was<br />\nthe legal agreement and is now being flagrantly<br />\nviolated.<br />\nIf it is true, as has been said, that the extra<br />\npayment is necessary because of funds frozen in<br />\nthe Union Trust Company, then why were not plans<br />\nlaid accordingly before the money was collected<br />\nfrom students at the beginning of this year?

Lawrence<br />\nHill and William Gordon, members of<br />\nthe Yale chapter of the National Student League, were arrested during the<br />\nfirst part of December for standing in<br />\nthe picket line during the Kirschner<br />\nfoundry strike in New Haven.<br />\nImmediately after the arrests the Yale<br />\nDaily News gave the matter wide publicity, and two groups of students were<br />\norganized to protest to the Mayor. The<br />\nfirst group was refused admittance. The<br />\nsecond was permitted to send a delegation of three as spokesmen to His Honor,<br />\nwhereupon they were harangued with a<br />\nblast against communism. A large number of students attempted to be present<br />\nat the trials, but the police cleared the<br />\ncourtroom of everyone not directly connected with the cases.<br />\nIT IS POINTED out by persons interested in the controversy that many<br />\nof the students taking part in the various<br />\nprotests had never demonstrated in anything but a football rally before. The<br />\narrests, moreover, followed not only the<br />\npicketing but articles in the Yale Daily<br />\nNews describing conditions in the Kirschner plant. Dean Clarence Mendel is<br />\nquoted as saying: \"Yale college authorities are entirely out of sympathy with<br />\nthe interference of students in New<br />\nHaven affairs about which they are uninformed . . . The college will not<br />\nencourage the students in any extra-legal<br />\nattempts to determine the right or wrong<br />\nof any local problems.\"<br />\nSOMEBODY should inform the dean<br />\nthat picketing has been declared legal by<br />\nno less a tribunal than the Supreme Court<br />\nof the United States; there was, therefore, nothing extra-legal in the action of<br />\nthe students, unless it is illegal to print<br />\narticles describing conditions in a particular factory. If the articles are unfavorable and untrue, there are still libel<br />\nlaws to which the factory owners may<br />\nhave recourse. If they are true, there is<br />\nevery reason for college students to take<br />\nan interest in them and in strikes generally.<br />\nThere is something most unseemly in<br />\nthe attitude of a college ocer who deliberately opposes, and attempts to persuade the undergraduates in his charge to<br />\noppose, student criticism of local industrial conditions.

He expressed a disinclination to live under the Soviets because of its denial of liberty, its<br />\nviolence and compulsion involving<br />\nperpetual revolution and a restriction of emigration, and its dogmatic<br />\natheism. At the same time he admitted that an attempt to abolish unemployment, injustice, and poverty<br />\nwere \"amazingly good things.\"<br />\nUnderdog Helped<br />\n<br />\nWith regard to the NRA and the<br />\nAAA, Mr. Eddy believed that the<br />\nRoosevelt program was out to help<br />\nthe underdog.

These<br />\nathletics boys are slippery and elusive; but there's<br />\nsome consolation in the fact that we scared them<br />\ninto showing their real hand.<br />\nThe hand is this: they have to be continually<br />\nridden by the students before they can be depended upon to do their jobs efficiently. One of<br />\nthe members of the Athletic Council, a high University official, said a very significant thing when<br />\nhe recommended to the 0. D. K. committee, which<br />\nrecently protested before the Council that the<br />\ncaptains and managers of the teams were the logical ones to complain when the coach and financial<br />\nmanager neglected to supply enough equipment<br />\nand coaching talent. It seems to show the attitude<br />\nof the authorities \u2014 that continual prodding is<br />\nthe only way to secure decent treatment from the<br />\nathletic department.<br /><br />\nBut It's Strikingly Flimsy<br />\nBut though the officials have escaped the terrain which we beseiged they have very naively<br />\nleft themselves in open ground and entirely defenseless before some of our more important<br />\ncharges. They spiel off glibly that so many uniforms have been ordered here, so much money<br />\nappropriated there, that necessary economies forced<br />\nthe dropping of Mallonee as assistant coach. But<br />\nwe want to know why the money wasn't spent before? The money was available last year and yet<br />\nit wasn't spent. How do we know that the same<br />\nthing won't happen next year? Is it an indication<br />\nof competence on the part of an athletic administration which has to be dragged by the nose to do<br />\nthe obvious? We believe emphatically that it is<br />\nnot. The squirming of the department under the<br />\ncross-fire which has afflicted it for the past three<br />\nweeks is to us too much of an admission of guilt.<br />\nIts almost frenzied efforts to prove that it is doing what is needful have left us skeptical of its<br />\npower of self-motivation after the pressure is<br />\nremoved. The clam-like nature of its attitude toward every decent question we ask is becoming<br />\nIt is not apparent that there is any need for<br />\neconomies such as were introduced last year,<br />\nnamely, the cutting of Mallonee and of training<br />\ntable. Particularly when nearly $500 of the appropriation was not spent and when we are supporting a coach on a vastly disproportionate salary.<br />\nJust what sort of reasoning, we wonder, does the<br />\nathletic department think we follow? The gaping<br />\nholes in its defense would accomodate the coachand-four of the old adage.<br /><br />\nSo It Won't Do<br />\nSo far, gentlemen, you haven't come across<br />\nwith anything that amounts to anything. We'll<br />\nhave to insist on more concrete evidence of good<br />\nintentions. If we don't get it now we may never<br />\nget it, because there's no assurance that there will<br />\nalways be the freedom of criticism which we experience at present nor the coincidence of cit cumstances which makes this a particularly appropriate time to demand an accounting.<br /><br />\nSoothing Prospect<br />\nWriting editorials on campus problems, if we<br />\nmay dignify our brawls as such, engenders a sort of<br />\nsour outlook on the goodness of humanity as an applied principle. But we see some redeeming feature;<br />\nat least somebody concurs with our ideas of good<br />\nsense. And who should it be but the freshman?<br />\nMotivated by some hitherto unfelt stimulus the<br />\nfrosh have decided that it's well to lock to the<br />\nfuture, and so have decided that they will bolter<br />\nup their treasury so that when they reach seniorhood (that Valhalla of intellectual embryos\u2014just<br />\nask a senior), the class dues will be within reason.<br />\nIt's a wise move to plan the frosh-soph dance; the<br />\nrewards will come later.<br />\nAdditional evidence of good sense is the effort<br />\nto interject some semblance of coherence and direction to the annual banquet season fighting.<br />\nLast year we suggested an organized flag rush,<br /><br />\nbut a pants rush is just as good and probably<br />\nmore interesting. There are some freshmen,<br />\nnames given on request, whose souls would be<br />\nmaterially benefitted by a little workout after the<br />\npants-rush detail is accomplished.<br /><br />\nAh9<br /><br />\nRats!<br /><br />\nWalt Disney's Pied Piper of Hamlin has nothing on Baltimore's local rat survey. However,<br />\nin the modern version of Browning's immortal<br />\ntale, only a small percentage of Baltimore's rats<br />\nare captured; and, as far as the Hopkins is concerned, the countless rodent denizens of the University<br />\ncontinue to gambol on the green in complete<br />\nsecurity.<br />\nAs an example of the small scale upon which<br />\nthe hunting operations by the United States Quarantine Station at Curtis Bay are carried on in<br />\nBaltimore, only 300 rats were caught on a recent<br />\npeak day of the campaign now under way. But<br />\nin the face of this Dr. H. F. White, director of the<br />\nsurvey, has declared that \"The showing thus far<br />\nis very gratifying and demonstrates quite expert<br />\ntrapping by men with no experience.\"<br />\nNevertheless, even though the scope of the survey's operations be increased, the rats of our campus will undoubtedly remain unmolested. With<br />\nthis prospect in view, the suggestion has been<br />\nmade that the National Student League insert a<br />\nplank in their platform demanding a governmental<br />\nboard to execute an \"anti-rat\" movement, perhaps<br />\nsimilar to that now in use in France, where the<br />\nParis police are directing a drive against rats.<br />\nThere the Prefecture maintains a special service<br />\nof \"deratization,\" which has been especially active<br />\nduring the past year, having carried out anti-rat<br />\noffensives in 1,015 places in Paris and the suburbs.<br />\nBut something must indeed be done here, for<br />\nrats abound on the campus. They are especially<br />\nnumerous around Gilman Hall, and a student recently reported seeing one the size of a full-grown<br />\nmuskrat, strolling across the road at the south end<br />\nof the automobile tunnel. And they abound around the<br />\noutside of Alumni Memorial Hall\u2014\"Great rats, small<br />\nrats, lean rats, scrawny rats, brown rats, black rats,<br />\ngray rats, tawny rats, grave old plodders, gay<br />\nyoung friskers, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,<br />\ncocking tails and pricking whiskers, and families<br />\nby tens and dozens.\"<br /><br />\nCampus Brevities<br />\nUntil activities stop charging prices above the<br />\nS.

A. C., and editor of the Hullabaloo, the stu<br />\ndents will not receive a copy of the yearbook unless they make an extra payment. This, despite<br />\nthe fact that the S. A. C. card signed by Stern in<br />\nhis official capacity says that the holder of the<br />\ncard is to get, among other things, a copy of the<br />\nHullabaloo \"without further charge\". That was<br />\nthe legal agreement and is now being flagrantly<br />\nviolated.<br />\nIf it is true, as has been said, that the extra<br />\npayment is necessary because of funds frozen in<br />\nthe Union Trust Company, then why were not plans<br />\nlaid accordingly before the money was collected<br />\nfrom students at the beginning of this year? The<br />\nbank was closed in October; yet the Student Activities Council collected the ten dollars per student<br />\nand Stern signed each card, promising them something which, it is now claimed, cannot be supplied.<br />\nIf our extra-curricular organization leaders did not<br />\nknow how much money would be needed, then<br />\nthey are guilty of gross inefficiency; and if they<br />\nknew that they would be short money and yet<br />\nwent ahead with the selling of the compulsory<br />\nactivities cards, they are guilty of taking'money<br />\nunder false pretenses.<br />\nAnyone who criticises is immediately<br />\nsquelched by being asked for his method of unsnarling the tangle.

Lawrence<br />\nHill and William Gordon, members of<br />\nthe Yale chapter of the National Student League, were arrested during the<br />\nfirst part of December for standing in<br />\nthe picket line during the Kirschner<br />\nfoundry strike in New Haven.<br />\nImmediately after the arrests the Yale<br />\nDaily News gave the matter wide publicity, and two groups of students were<br />\norganized to protest to the Mayor. The<br />\nfirst group was refused admittance. The<br />\nsecond was permitted to send a delegation of three as spokesmen to His Honor,<br />\nwhereupon they were harangued with a<br />\nblast against communism. A large number of students attempted to be present<br />\nat the trials, but the police cleared the<br />\ncourtroom of everyone not directly connected with the cases.<br />\nIT IS POINTED out by persons interested in the controversy that many<br />\nof the students taking part in the various<br />\nprotests had never demonstrated in anything but a football rally before. The<br />\narrests, moreover, followed not only the<br />\npicketing but articles in the Yale Daily<br />\nNews describing conditions in the Kirschner plant. Dean Clarence Mendel is<br />\nquoted as saying: \"Yale college authorities are entirely out of sympathy with<br />\nthe interference of students in New<br />\nHaven affairs about which they are uninformed . . . The college will not<br />\nencourage the students in any extra-legal<br />\nattempts to determine the right or wrong<br />\nof any local problems.\"<br />\nSOMEBODY should inform the dean<br />\nthat picketing has been declared legal by<br />\nno less a tribunal than the Supreme Court<br />\nof the United States; there was, therefore, nothing extra-legal in the action of<br />\nthe students, unless it is illegal to print<br />\narticles describing conditions in a particular factory. If the articles are unfavorable and untrue, there are still libel<br />\nlaws to which the factory owners may<br />\nhave recourse. If they are true, there is<br />\nevery reason for college students to take<br />\nan interest in them and in strikes generally.<br />\nThere is something most unseemly in<br />\nthe attitude of a college ocer who deliberately opposes, and attempts to persuade the undergraduates in his charge to<br />\noppose, student criticism of local industrial conditions. Yale is doubtless offering courses in sociology and economics.<br />\nWhere is there a better place for a direct application of the theories taught in<br />\nthe classroom than in the town in which<br />\nthe college is situated?<br /><br />\nTHE third consideration is<br />\n\"whether any student gets much that<br />\nis worthwhile out of a course that<br />\nhe is forced to take against his will.\"<br />\nThe editorial ends by saying, \"A<br />\nyoung man who risks expulsion in<br />\nsuch a situation seems to us to enjoy a preponderance of evidence on<br />\nthe side of his sincerity.\"<br /><br />\nin<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 1, Col. 2<br />\nsuperior ability in the creation<br />\nwomen characters.
