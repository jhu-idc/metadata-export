The Medical School,<br />\non the other hand, is not too<br />\nconcerned with the increase,<br />\naccording to Phillips, since any<br />\nadditional revenues generated by<br />\na tuition hike would comprise a<br />\nvery small part of the budgets.<br />\nHowever, a tuition raise for<br />\nthe School of Hygiene \"would be<br />\ntremendously valuable because it<br />\ncould greatly increase their<br />\nGeneral Funds,\" representatives<br />\nfrom Hygiene indicated at the<br />\nFaculty Budget Meeting, Phillips<br />\nsaid.<br />\n<br />\nLegislation may hurt donation incentive<br />\nBy DONALD MORISATO<br />\nIn an effort to eliminate tax<br />\nloopholes, Congress is now<br />\nconsidering legislation which may<br />\nundermine the financial<br />\nincentives that have traditionally<br />\nencouraged eontributions to<br />\neducational institutions.<br />\nRobert Bowie, Hopkins Vice<br />\nPresident for Business<br />\nManagement, says that such<br />\nlegislation \"would undoubtedly<br />\nhave an adverse effect on the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nThe Filer Commission on<br />\nPrivate Philanthropy and Public<br />\nNeeds is expected to recommend<br />\nretention of the tax incentives<br />\nwhich encourage the \u2022rich to<br />\nmake substantial monetary<br />\ncontributions to higher<br />\neducation.<br />\nTax breaks currently provide<br />\niome $91 billion in benefits,<br />\nwhich are largely limited to<br />\nwealthy, individuals and<br />\ncorporations.<br />\nAt Hopkins, 21 percent of the<br />\n<br />\ntotal operating budget comes<br />\nfrom private donations, including<br />\nfoundation and corporation<br />\ngrants. Individual donations,<br />\nhowever, comprise only half of<br />\nthat amount.<br />\nRobert Carter, Director of<br />\nDevelopment for the Hopkins<br />\nFund, stresses the importance of<br />\nthese contributions by private<br />\ncitizens: \"Although the<br />\npercentage may seem to be<br />\ninsignificant, these donations are<br />\nprobably one of the most<br />\nimportant sources of University<br />\nincome, since they are<br />\nunrestricted.\"<br />\n\"They are flexible enough to<br />\nbe used in the most critically<br />\nneeded areas, in contrast to<br />\ngovernment, foundation, and<br />\ncorporation grants which are<br />\nalmost always specified for a<br />\nparticular field..\"<br />\nOne alternative to tax breaks<br />\nfor the wealthy involves fixed<br />\nallowable deductions for all<br />\nindividuals, designed to<br />\n<br />\nencourage giving at the middle<br />\nand lower income levels.<br />\nCommenting on this type of<br />\nlegislation, Carter says, \"I think<br />\nsuch action would have a<br />\ndetrimental effect for many<br />\ninstitutions because higher<br />\neducation has traditionally<br />\nenjoyed the benefits of<br />\nphilanthropy. In fact, this<br />\nUniversity was founded through<br />\na philanthropic act. The<br />\nwell-educated elite, has up to<br />\nnow, largely supported the<br />\nprivate, prestigious institutions.\"<br />\nPublic-Burden<br />\n\"I fear that with an abolition<br />\nof tax incentives, the federal<br />\ngovernment is in effect asking the<br />\npublic in general to take up the<br />\nslack. This seems improbable<br />\nsince those in the middle and<br />\nlower income levels are usually<br />\nnot as well attuned to the needs<br />\nof higher education. Hence, those<br />\nwho have benefited mo,st from a<br />\nhigher education must be looked<br />\nupon to sustain these<br />\n<br />\ninstitutions.\"<br />\nAnother area which has<br />\ncome under attack is the tax<br />\nbenefits resulting from donations<br />\nof appreciated property.<br />\nCurrently, when an individual<br />\ngives a university shares of stock,<br />\nreal estate, or other property that<br />\nhas increased in value since he<br />\nbought it, he is allowed to deduct<br />\nthe higher current value from his<br />\ntaxable income. This provision<br />\nhas been criticized as a tax<br />\ndiscrimination favoring the<br />\nwealthy.<br />\nAbolition of this provision,<br />\nCarter feels, \"will hamper our<br />\n[Hopkins') efforts to secure<br />\ngifts. There's no question about<br />\nthat.\"<br />\n\"Granted, tax advantage is not<br />\nthe prime motivating force<br />\nbehind philanthropic<br />\ncontribution; but it is a definitely<br />\nimportant secondary factor.\"<br />\nThis provision has been<br />\nconsidered invaluable in capital<br />\ncampaigns.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-lettedoctober 7, 1975<br />\n<br />\nmeetings<br />\nYOUNG DEMOCRATS<br />\nThe next meeting of, the<br />\nYoung Democrats will be<br />\nOctober 13,4 p.m. in Conference<br />\nRoom A.

But since the winning<br />\nbidder was Mitsubishi Steel (a<br />\nJapanese firm), the city had the<br />\nproject rebid to see if an<br />\nAmerican firm could go lower<br />\nthan $26 million.

Though it is difficult to accept any<br />\ntuition hike\" after last year's raise of $300, we feel that<br />\nstudents have been well-served by Muller in the deliberations<br />\nof the past two weeks, during which some faculty were heard<br />\nto argue for a much larger tuition raise.<br />\nHowever, with the majority of the decision-making on the<br />\ntuition increase already completed, students can appreciate<br />\nthe extent to which they have been excluded from a decision<br />\nwhose consequences they alone will have to bear. While we<br />\nunderstand that administrators must of necessity handle most<br />\nof the negotiations in financial matte.rs, there is no reason<br />\nthat students should have no voice in a matter which so<br />\nsingularly affects them.<br />\nIf faculty, who feel little direct result from a rise in tuition<br />\nare allowed to advance arguments from their privileged<br />\ncommittee scats, students in turn should be entitled to<br />\nregister opinions and forward arguments on this most<br />\nimportant issue. Stu-dent participation could come in the<br />\nform of a Student Council committee, or a special panel<br />\nappointed by the SC and advisory to President Muller or his<br />\nfiscal administrators. At present, students have no direct<br />\nmethod of communicating their sentiments and<br />\nrecommendations to the administration.<br />\nWe realize that student participation in fiscal affairs is a<br />\ntouchy matter without real precedent, especially with an<br />\nadministration which last year balked at releasing budget<br />\nfigures to the Student Council. We feel, though, that such an<br />\nelement is necessary if the University is to cope with the<br />\nimpending series- of budget deficits without, in the words of<br />\nPresident Muller, \"impacting adversely on the quality of<br />\neducation.\"<br />\n<br />\ntaxes<br />\nIt is somewhat ironic that legislation before Congress that<br />\nwould begin to make the payment of taxes in this country a<br />\nbit more equitable would, at the same time, partially limit<br />\nthe flow of philanthropic donations to non-profit stitutions.<br />\nWhile the effects of such a measure could seriously<br />\nundermine the financial positions of many educational<br />\ninstitutions like Hopkins, we feel that su,ch legislation should<br />\nbe passed by Congress and implemented as soon as possible<br />\nbecause some redistribution of the wealth at this time is<br />\nnecessary to the health and possibly survival of this country.<br />\nSo, even though the effects of such a change on colleges and<br />\nuniversities could be severe, the current -financial crisis for<br />\ncolleges nationwide tells us that the healthiest thing<br />\nfinancially for colleges is a healthy national economy.<br />\nIf the legislation is passed, Hopkins donors will be called<br />\nupon to make far greater sacrifices than ever to support the<br />\nschool, and support will, quite understandably, dwindle.<br />\nNevertheless, we don't see how anyone in the University<br />\ncould conscience the continuation of a system by which the<br />\nrich preserve their wealth at the expense of others.<br />\nIf nothing else, this dilemma brings out to what extent<br />\nHopkins, and schools like Hopkins, are dependent on the<br />\nwealth.), for their existence. If donations become scarcer and<br />\nscarcer, the wealthy will probably be able. to exert more of an<br />\ninfluence on higher education than they already do. And if<br />\nwe consider the increasing dependence of higher education<br />\non Federal monies and the rules that must be met to get that<br />\nmoney, one can only wonder where colleges will be even<br />\n\u2018after current fiscal crises have abated.<br />\n<br />\nBernstein calls for press review<br />\nBy GEORGE B.

Sophomore<br />\nhalfback Jerry Faraino was one<br />\nof the few Blue Jays to enjoy a<br />\ngood day, rushing for 73 yards<br />\non 14 carries. This achievement is<br />\nmade more impressive when it is<br />\nrealized that Hopkins actually<br />\n\"netted\" only 72 yards rushing<br />\nfor the entire game.<br />\nFarainoi sparked the lone Blue<br />\nJays' scoring drive by breaking a<br />\nthird quarter running play for a<br />\n17 yard gain to the Hopkins' 42<br />\nyard line. The rest of the drive<br />\nwas highlighted by two fine<br />\nreceptions by junior Bruce<br />\nBaillie, including one tough<br />\n13-yard grab which set up the<br />\nHopkins' score\u2014a 22 yard pass<br />\nfrom sophomore quarterback<br />\nDave Emala to sophomore split<br />\nend Joe Devlin. The Jays try for<br />\na two-point conversion failed,<br />\nand that was the end of their<br />\noffense.<br />\nTo put the Jays' performance<br />\nin perspective, that 75 yard drive<br />\naccounted for virtually half of<br />\nHopkins' total of 153 yards<br />\ngained in the game.<br />\nAs bad as the Hopkins' offense<br />\nwas, the Hopkins' defense more<br />\nthan matched its performance.<br />\nThe Blue Jay defensive line not<br />\nonly was unable to mount an<br />\neffective pass rush, but it was<br />\nequally unsuccessful, in Shutting<br />\n<br />\ndown the Diplomat running game<br />\nwhich accounted for four.<br />\ntouchdowns.<br />\nFurthermore, the Blue Jay<br />\ndefensive secondary was also<br />\nrepeatedly victimized, as the<br />\nFranklin and Marshall,<br />\nquarterbacks fired four scoring<br />\nstrikes. It did not matter who<br />\nwas doing the throwing for the<br />\nDiplomats, as three different<br />\nquarterbacks accounted for the<br />\nfour touchdown tosses. The most<br />\neffective of the Franklin and<br />\nMarshall quarterbacks, however,<br />\nwas a junior starter Joe Coviello,<br />\nwho passed for two scores and<br />\nbroke the FPM career total<br />\noffense record in the process.<br />\nIn addition to Coviello, other<br />\nDiplomats who had outstanding<br />\ngames on offense were junior<br />\nfullback Tom Donaldson, who<br />\nscored the initial Franklin and<br />\nMarhsall touchdown, and senior<br />\ntailback Ted D'Amico, who<br />\nscored three touchdowns.<br />\nHopkins' mistakes in the first<br />\nhalf helped F&M to three of their<br />\nfour first half touchdowns and<br />\npaved the way for the rout. The<br />\nDiplomats' first touchdown, the<br />\nonly score of the first quarter,<br />\nwas set up when they recovered<br />\nan Emala fumble on the Blue<br />\nJays 17 yard line.<br />\nAs the lost fumble<br />\nimmediately followed an<br />\ninterception by Hopkins' senior<br />\nco-captain Bill Norbeck, the play<br />\naccurately foreshadowed what<br />\nthe Jays' could expect for the<br />\nrest of the day. On the second<br />\nplay after the fumble recovery,<br />\nCoviello passed 17 yards for the<br />\ntouchdown to Donaldson, who<br />\nwas all alone in the left side of<br />\nthe end zone.<br />\n<br />\nThe second Franklin and<br />\nMarhsall score, a 15 yard run by<br />\nD'Amico, came with less than<br />\ntwo minutes gone in the second<br />\nquarter. The touchdown run<br />\nconcluded an 88 yard drive<br />\nwhich saw Coviello complete a.<br />\n40 yard pass to senior receiver<br />\nJohn Slavoski.

Individual donations,<br />\nhowever, comprise only half of<br />\nthat amount.<br />\nRobert Carter, Director of<br />\nDevelopment for the Hopkins<br />\nFund, stresses the importance of<br />\nthese contributions by private<br />\ncitizens: \"Although the<br />\npercentage may seem to be<br />\ninsignificant, these donations are<br />\nprobably one of the most<br />\nimportant sources of University<br />\nincome, since they are<br />\nunrestricted.\"<br />\n\"They are flexible enough to<br />\nbe used in the most critically<br />\nneeded areas, in contrast to<br />\ngovernment, foundation, and<br />\ncorporation grants which are<br />\nalmost always specified for a<br />\nparticular field..\"<br />\nOne alternative to tax breaks<br />\nfor the wealthy involves fixed<br />\nallowable deductions for all<br />\nindividuals, designed to<br /><br />\nencourage giving at the middle<br />\nand lower income levels.<br />\nCommenting on this type of<br />\nlegislation, Carter says, \"I think<br />\nsuch action would have a<br />\ndetrimental effect for many<br />\ninstitutions because higher<br />\neducation has traditionally<br />\nenjoyed the benefits of<br />\nphilanthropy. In fact, this<br />\nUniversity was founded through<br />\na philanthropic act. The<br />\nwell-educated elite, has up to<br />\nnow, largely supported the<br />\nprivate, prestigious institutions.\"<br />\nPublic-Burden<br />\n\"I fear that with an abolition<br />\nof tax incentives, the federal<br />\ngovernment is in effect asking the<br />\npublic in general to take up the<br />\nslack. This seems improbable<br />\nsince those in the middle and<br />\nlower income levels are usually<br />\nnot as well attuned to the needs<br />\nof higher education. Hence, those<br />\nwho have benefited mo,st from a<br />\nhigher education must be looked<br />\nupon to sustain these<br /><br />\ninstitutions.\"<br />\nAnother area which has<br />\ncome under attack is the tax<br />\nbenefits resulting from donations<br />\nof appreciated property.<br />\nCurrently, when an individual<br />\ngives a university shares of stock,<br />\nreal estate, or other property that<br />\nhas increased in value since he<br />\nbought it, he is allowed to deduct<br />\nthe higher current value from his<br />\ntaxable income. This provision<br />\nhas been criticized as a tax<br />\ndiscrimination favoring the<br />\nwealthy.<br />\nAbolition of this provision,<br />\nCarter feels, \"will hamper our<br />\n[Hopkins') efforts to secure<br />\ngifts.

Since the<br />\nInstitute attracts many<br />\nnon-paying students from the<br />\ninner city and has a small<br />\nendowment, \"the school is<br />\nfinding it harder and harder to<br />\nbalance the budget,\" according<br />\nto Bob Murphy, Director of<br />\nAccouting the Business.<br />\nDespite the fact that tuition<br />\nhikes have become standard<br />\nprocedure over the past few<br />\nyears, little student reaction is<br />\nexpected by administrators.<br />\nRichard Palmer, Goucher's top<br /><br />\nfinancial official, believes that<br />\n\"though we don't expect the<br />\nstudents to be happy, we're not<br />\nanticipating undergraduate action<br />\nother than the usual discussion.<br />\nPeople have become conditioned<br />\nto accept price rises\u2014especially if<br />\nthe reasons for the increase are<br />\nvalid.\"<br />\nMore importantly, admissions<br />\nstandards may be adversely<br />\naffected.

Though it is difficult to accept any<br />\ntuition hike\" after last year's raise of $300, we feel that<br />\nstudents have been well-served by Muller in the deliberations<br />\nof the past two weeks, during which some faculty were heard<br />\nto argue for a much larger tuition raise.<br />\nHowever, with the majority of the decision-making on the<br />\ntuition increase already completed, students can appreciate<br />\nthe extent to which they have been excluded from a decision<br />\nwhose consequences they alone will have to bear. While we<br />\nunderstand that administrators must of necessity handle most<br />\nof the negotiations in financial matte.rs, there is no reason<br />\nthat students should have no voice in a matter which so<br />\nsingularly affects them.<br />\nIf faculty, who feel little direct result from a rise in tuition<br />\nare allowed to advance arguments from their privileged<br />\ncommittee scats, students in turn should be entitled to<br />\nregister opinions and forward arguments on this most<br />\nimportant issue. Stu-dent participation could come in the<br />\nform of a Student Council committee, or a special panel<br />\nappointed by the SC and advisory to President Muller or his<br />\nfiscal administrators. At present, students have no direct<br />\nmethod of communicating their sentiments and<br />\nrecommendations to the administration.<br />\nWe realize that student participation in fiscal affairs is a<br />\ntouchy matter without real precedent, especially with an<br />\nadministration which last year balked at releasing budget<br />\nfigures to the Student Council. We feel, though, that such an<br />\nelement is necessary if the University is to cope with the<br />\nimpending series- of budget deficits without, in the words of<br />\nPresident Muller, \"impacting adversely on the quality of<br />\neducation.\"<br /><br />\ntaxes<br />\nIt is somewhat ironic that legislation before Congress that<br />\nwould begin to make the payment of taxes in this country a<br />\nbit more equitable would, at the same time, partially limit<br />\nthe flow of philanthropic donations to non-profit stitutions.<br />\nWhile the effects of such a measure could seriously<br />\nundermine the financial positions of many educational<br />\ninstitutions like Hopkins, we feel that su,ch legislation should<br />\nbe passed by Congress and implemented as soon as possible<br />\nbecause some redistribution of the wealth at this time is<br />\nnecessary to the health and possibly survival of this country.<br />\nSo, even though the effects of such a change on colleges and<br />\nuniversities could be severe, the current -financial crisis for<br />\ncolleges nationwide tells us that the healthiest thing<br />\nfinancially for colleges is a healthy national economy.<br />\nIf the legislation is passed, Hopkins donors will be called<br />\nupon to make far greater sacrifices than ever to support the<br />\nschool, and support will, quite understandably, dwindle.<br />\nNevertheless, we don't see how anyone in the University<br />\ncould conscience the continuation of a system by which the<br />\nrich preserve their wealth at the expense of others.<br />\nIf nothing else, this dilemma brings out to what extent<br />\nHopkins, and schools like Hopkins, are dependent on the<br />\nwealth.), for their existence. If donations become scarcer and<br />\nscarcer, the wealthy will probably be able. to exert more of an<br />\ninfluence on higher education than they already do. And if<br />\nwe consider the increasing dependence of higher education<br />\non Federal monies and the rules that must be met to get that<br />\nmoney, one can only wonder where colleges will be even<br />\n\u2018after current fiscal crises have abated.<br /><br />\nBernstein calls for press review<br />\nBy GEORGE B.

This achievement is<br />\nmade more impressive when it is<br />\nrealized that Hopkins actually<br />\n\"netted\" only 72 yards rushing<br />\nfor the entire game.<br />\nFarainoi sparked the lone Blue<br />\nJays' scoring drive by breaking a<br />\nthird quarter running play for a<br />\n17 yard gain to the Hopkins' 42<br />\nyard line. The rest of the drive<br />\nwas highlighted by two fine<br />\nreceptions by junior Bruce<br />\nBaillie, including one tough<br />\n13-yard grab which set up the<br />\nHopkins' score\u2014a 22 yard pass<br />\nfrom sophomore quarterback<br />\nDave Emala to sophomore split<br />\nend Joe Devlin. The Jays try for<br />\na two-point conversion failed,<br />\nand that was the end of their<br />\noffense.<br />\nTo put the Jays' performance<br />\nin perspective, that 75 yard drive<br />\naccounted for virtually half of<br />\nHopkins' total of 153 yards<br />\ngained in the game.<br />\nAs bad as the Hopkins' offense<br />\nwas, the Hopkins' defense more<br />\nthan matched its performance.<br />\nThe Blue Jay defensive line not<br />\nonly was unable to mount an<br />\neffective pass rush, but it was<br />\nequally unsuccessful, in Shutting<br /><br />\ndown the Diplomat running game<br />\nwhich accounted for four.<br />\ntouchdowns.<br />\nFurthermore, the Blue Jay<br />\ndefensive secondary was also<br />\nrepeatedly victimized, as the<br />\nFranklin and Marshall,<br />\nquarterbacks fired four scoring<br />\nstrikes. It did not matter who<br />\nwas doing the throwing for the<br />\nDiplomats, as three different<br />\nquarterbacks accounted for the<br />\nfour touchdown tosses. The most<br />\neffective of the Franklin and<br />\nMarshall quarterbacks, however,<br />\nwas a junior starter Joe Coviello,<br />\nwho passed for two scores and<br />\nbroke the FPM career total<br />\noffense record in the process.<br />\nIn addition to Coviello, other<br />\nDiplomats who had outstanding<br />\ngames on offense were junior<br />\nfullback Tom Donaldson, who<br />\nscored the initial Franklin and<br />\nMarhsall touchdown, and senior<br />\ntailback Ted D'Amico, who<br />\nscored three touchdowns.<br />\nHopkins' mistakes in the first<br />\nhalf helped F&amp;M to three of their<br />\nfour first half touchdowns and<br />\npaved the way for the rout. The<br />\nDiplomats' first touchdown, the<br />\nonly score of the first quarter,<br />\nwas set up when they recovered<br />\nan Emala fumble on the Blue<br />\nJays 17 yard line.<br />\nAs the lost fumble<br />\nimmediately followed an<br />\ninterception by Hopkins' senior<br />\nco-captain Bill Norbeck, the play<br />\naccurately foreshadowed what<br />\nthe Jays' could expect for the<br />\nrest of the day. On the second<br />\nplay after the fumble recovery,<br />\nCoviello passed 17 yards for the<br />\ntouchdown to Donaldson, who<br />\nwas all alone in the left side of<br />\nthe end zone.<br /><br />\nThe second Franklin and<br />\nMarhsall score, a 15 yard run by<br />\nD'Amico, came with less than<br />\ntwo minutes gone in the second<br />\nquarter. The touchdown run<br />\nconcluded an 88 yard drive<br />\nwhich saw Coviello complete a.<br />\n40 yard pass to senior receiver<br />\nJohn Slavoski. D'Amico scored<br />\nhis first touchdown of the game<br />\non the following play.<br />\nAnother Hopkins' turnover led<br />\nto Franklin and Marhsall's third<br />\ntouchdown. Sophomore George<br />\nBarrett intercepted an Emala pass<br /><br />\nmaintaining their stickwork and<br />\nkeeping their \"hand in\" the<br />\ngame.<br />\nAlthough sdme of the hardier<br />\nspring lacrosse players play<br />\nfootball or soccer, many of the<br />\nprevious year's varsity and, JV<br />\nplayers participate in the fall<br />\nprogram (though it is not<br />\nmandatory).<br /><br />\ninterference call against Hopkins<br />\nnullified an interception by<br />\nsenior<br />\nlinebacker Jack<br />\nDeckelbaum. The first half ended<br />\nwith the Diplomats well in<br />\ncommand 28-0.<br />\nThe second half began where<br />\nthe first half left off, with<br />\nD'Amico scoring on another<br />\nthree yard touchdown jaunt.<br />\nHowever, Hopkins then took the<br />\nensuing kickoff and drove 75<br />\nyards for its only score of the<br />\ngame, the 22 yard pass reception<br />\nby Devlin.<br /><br />\nRooters continue winning ways<br />\nBy DAVID KRAUS<br />\nThe Blue Jay Varisty Soccer<br />\nteam continued its mastery over<br />\nMAC rivals Saturday with a 5-0<br />\ntrouncing of the Ursinus College<br />\nBears.<br />\nThe game, played on the<br />\nloser's home turf in Collegeville,<br />\nPa., marked the second<br />\nconsecutive league win for<br />\nHopkins and put them in first<br />\nplace in their division of the<br />\nconference.<br />\nThe Jays took control of the<br />\ncontest from the very outset and<br />\nimmediately began their 31-shot<br />\nassault on the Ursinus goal. The<br />\nhome team defense was able to<br />\ncontrol the high -flying<br />\nHomewood offense for only a<br />\nshort time before the onslaught<br />\nbegan.<br />\nFreshman halfback Bob<br />\nTeasdale opened the scoring at<br />\nthe twenty-minute mark with<br />\nwhat proved to be the winning<br />\ngoal.

With this in mind,<br />\nlacrosse head coach Henry<br />\nCiccarone and his staff organize<br />\na lacrosse team every fall.,<br />\nOpen to all potential Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse players, the fall team is a<br />\nseries of informal practices and<br />\nscrimmages which help each<br />\nplayer to maintain his individual<br />\nand team skills while allowing the<br />\ncoaches to evaluate the type of<br />\ntalent they will have for the<br />\nspring season.<br />\nEmphasis is placed on keeping<br />\nthe program as informal and<br />\nlow-key as possible. Practices are<br />\nheld twice a week, with all<br />\nparticipants getting a chance to<br />\nplay and be observed by a coach.<br />\nScrimmages are also low-key.<br />\nAlthough played like a regular<br />\ngame, all players are given a<br />\nchance to play, regardless of the<br />\nscore. Scoring has never been<br />\nmuch of a problem for Hopkins,<br />\nthough, and fall teams in the past<br />\nusually end the \"season\"<br />\nundefeated.<br />\nFor many freshmen lacrosse<br />\nplayers, the fall team is a chance<br />\nto work into the Hopkins' system<br />\nwithout the pressures of spring<br />\ntryouts. For the older players, it<br />\nis mainly a time devoted to<br /><br />\non the Franklin and Marshall 24<br />\nyard line and returned it all the<br />\nway to the Hopkins' 36. Wasting<br />\nno time, Coviello came out<br />\nthrowing on the next play and<br />\nhit Ivie for a 36 yard score. Ivie's<br />\nfirst touchdown of the game ran<br />\nthe score to 21-0.<br />\nThe final F&amp;M tally of the half<br />\ncame with just over six minutes<br />\nremaining, as D'Amico scored his<br />\nsecond touchdown, this time on<br />\na three yard run. The Blue Jays'<br />\nattempt to stop the 56 yard drive<br />\nwas blunted when a pass<br /><br />\nFour scrimmages have been<br />\nscheduled for this year:<br />\nOct. 9 4:15 Morgan State (H)<br />\nOct. 16 4:15 Delaware Univ.(H)<br />\nOct. 18 2:30 North Carolina(H)<br />\n(A)<br />\nOct. 23 4:15 UMBC<br />\nHome<br />\ngames are usually played on<br />\nHomewood Field, and all are free<br />\nto the public.<br /><br />\nand Teasdale was able to head it<br />\npast the helpless netminder.<br />\nCunningham scored the first<br />\nof his three goals several minutes<br />\nlater on a freak play.
