Riggs Griffith,<br />\nassistant treasurer for Hopkins<br />\nand the person in charge of the<br />\ninvestigation, said that he talked<br />\nto both the head of First<br />\nNational's international<br />\n<br />\ndepartment and to Sam Monroe,<br />\na vice-president of the bank.\"We<br />\ntalked last week and again today.<br />\nWe feel that they are not<br />\nparticipating in any<br />\ndiscriminatory practices<br />\ncomplying with the Arab boycott<br />\nof Israeli firms.\"<br />\nGriffith explained it is his<br />\nunderstanding that First National<br />\nacted only as a financial<br />\nintermediary between Arab firms<br />\nand U.S. enterprises. First<br />\nNational compares its activity<br />\nwith the post office and<br />\ntelephone company, Griffith<br />\nsaid. They contend that they<br />\nmerely clear letters of credit<br />\nwhich transfer funds between<br />\nforeign and U.S. banks. A<br />\nspokesman for the bank added<br />\nthat it has processed \"relatively<br />\nfew\" letters of credit and has<br />\nreported all of them to the<br />\n<br />\nCommerce Department.<br />\nClaiming that they are not<br />\ndirectly involved with Arab<br />\nfirms, many banks, like First<br />\nNational, have been<br />\nunderstandably upset at the<br />\nimplication that they have taken<br />\nan active participatory role in the<br />\nArab boycott. Recently, the<br />\nAdministration has opened to the<br />\npublic reports from American<br />\nfirms of Arab requests pertaining<br />\nto the boycott. The firms, such<br />\nas First National, must regularly<br />\nreport all such activity to the<br />\nCommerce Department. Firms<br />\nreporting, but not honoring Arab<br />\nrequests, have had charges of<br />\ncomplicity leveled against them.<br />\nAccording to the University,<br />\nFirst National received several<br />\nrequests from Arab groups asking<br />\nthat Israeli goods be boycotted.<br />\nIn many instances, the requests<br />\n<br />\naccompanied Arab letters of<br />\ncredit. Griffith said, however,<br />\nthat in each case the bank<br />\nreported the discriminatory<br />\nrequests to the government.<br />\nApparently acting on orders<br />\nfrom her superiors, Bernadette<br />\nCampitelli, Homewood branch<br />\nmanager, refused comment. Mrs.<br />\nCampitelli initially refused to<br />\ndisclose her first name to a<br />\nreporter. When pressed, she<br />\nobliged, stating, \"I really don't<br />\nsee why it's necessary, but<br />\nit's....\"<br />\nMrs. Campitelli had Howard<br />\nWilly, a regional officer for the<br />\nbank, do the explaining for her.<br />\nDescribing the Arab implication<br />\nas an \"unfortunate event,\" Willy<br />\nmade available a press release<br />\nfrom First National Chairman of<br />\nthe Board and President J.

They're<br />\ntaking the First Amendment route: screaming bloody murder<br />\nthat students' civil rights are being infringed upon.<br />\nIn all fairness, it should be said that the Student Council<br />\n(SC) has been placed in a precarious double-bind situation.<br />\nNo one wants to be called a censor. The SC decision,<br />\nhowever, should reflect the true majority opinion of the<br />\nstudentry, not the feelings of special interest groups or the<br />\nviews of the individual officer. That is what representative<br />\ngovernment is all- about.<br />\nAfter the original vote to show the film, everybody's<br />\nfriend, Jakie Hall, decided to get involved. Behind the<br />\nambiguous rhetoric of Dean Hall, it is easy to see his<br />\npartisanship Jakie wants the SC to vote again and make the<br />\nright decision.<br />\nIn ,his controversy, the fault is distributed equally among<br />\nall the parties involved.<br />\nThe BSU has waited too long to make this an -effective<br />\nissue. The Film Series program was made public the, first<br />\nweek of the semester: certainly there has been ample time for<br />\ncareful discussion among student representatives instead of<br />\nthis last minute rush which tends to be more emotional than<br />\nsensible.

This duo<br />\nconnected for six completions<br />\naccounting for over 130 yards<br />\nand two touchdowns.<br />\nThe Jays began their seering<br />\nblitz early in the third quarter.<br />\nTaking the second half kickoff at<br />\ntheir own thirty-one, JHU<br />\npromptly marched downfield to<br />\ntie the game. The drive was<br />\naccomplished mainly on the<br />\noverland route with halfback<br />\nJohn Railey going the final two<br />\nyards for the score. The<br />\ntwo-point conversion was not<br />\nsuccessful (the first of four such<br />\nfailures) and the count was 6-6.<br />\nOn the next Blue Jay offensive<br />\nseries, the Bender-Emala show<br />\nbegan. With a first and ten on the<br />\nGeorgetown 48, the quarterback<br />\nhit his favorite receiver with a<br />\npass that covered all the way to<br />\nthe Georgetown 2 yard line. Two<br />\nplays later, Railey scored his<br />\nsecond six-pointer and the Jays<br />\nwere ahead for good, 12-6.<br />\n<br />\nFollowing a Hoya punt,<br />\nBender and Emala continued<br />\ntheir assault on the Georgetown<br />\ndefense. Again on first down,<br />\nBender faded back to pass. This<br />\ntime, he hit Emala with a 64-yard<br />\ntouchdown pass, giving Hopkins<br />\nan 18-6 lead early in the fourth<br />\nquarter.<br />\nLeading by twelve points with<br />\nless than 12 minutes left in the<br />\ngame, it appeared as though<br />\nHopkins would breeze to victory.<br />\nHowever, such was not the case.<br />\nThe home team took the<br />\nkickoff following the latest Blue<br />\nJay score and began to march.<br />\nAided by a crucial (and<br />\nquestionable) penalty,<br />\nGeorgetown moved to a first<br />\ndown at the Jay 3-yard line. Two<br />\nplays later the Hoyas crossed the<br />\ngoal line and the accompanying<br />\nextra point made the score<br />\nuncomfortably close at 18-13.<br />\nForcing a Blue Jay punt,<br />\nGeorgetown got the ball back<br />\nwith less than four minutes<br />\nremaining in the game and<br />\nvictory still very much within the<br />\nrealm of possibility. However,<br />\nthe JHU defense proved equal to<br />\nthe task and came up with the<br />\nbig play.<br />\nOn second down, linebacker<br />\nKen Mills picked off a pass and<br />\nraced all the way to the<br />\nGeorgetown 9-yard line. Four<br />\nplays later, Bender hit Emala<br />\nwith a one-yard scoring toss and<br />\nthe Jays had their second victory<br />\nin five starts.<br />\nAfter the game, Cox gave his<br />\nline much of the credit for the<br />\noverall improvement of the<br />\noffensive play.<br />\n<br />\nCONTEST<br />\nMy guess is<br />\n<br />\n(Hopkins)<br />\n<br />\n(Moravian)<br />\n<br />\nWinner recieves a case of Beck's imported beer and a handsome<br />\nBeck's beer mug.<br />\nName<br />\n<br />\nAddress<br />\nI certify that I am 18 years or older.<br />\nFill out and bring to News-Letter office or mail to Box 1230<br />\nno later than Thursday, October 28,1976.<br />\nNOTE: If more than one person guesses the correct score, a<br />\nblindfold drawing of all correct scores will be held by this<br />\npublication.

The extra point was<br />\nmissed, however, and the score<br />\nremained at 6-0.<br />\nAccording to Coach Cox, the<br />\ntouchdown run was the result of<br />\n<br />\nDown F&M 4-0<br />\n<br />\na defensive breakdown.<br />\n\"Two men- a linebacker and a<br />\nsafety- were responsible for that<br />\nman,\" Cox later said, \"and they<br />\njust didn't do the job.\"<br />\nTalkie<br />\nThe score remained at 6-0 for<br />\nthe rest of the first two quarters,<br />\nalthough the Jays had several<br />\nexcellent chances to take the<br />\nlead.

Steve Galloway, who<br />\nhad just returned to the field<br />\nfollowing a minor injury, took a<br />\npass from center forward Greg<br />\nCunningham in front of the net<br />\nand put the ball in for the 1-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nThe Diplomats came close to<br />\nty ing the score minutes later<br />\nwhen a two man break developed<br />\nin the Hopkins' end of the,field.<br />\nTwo F and M attackmen were led<br />\nbeautifully with a pass by a<br />\nDiplomat back and came in on<br />\ngoalie Suesse in a two on one<br />\nadvantage. The Jay goalie was<br />\nforced to come out of the net to<br />\ncut down the shot angle and in<br />\ndoing so he was able to intercept<br />\na cross pass, thus halting the<br />\nthreat.<br />\nThe Blue Jays opened up their<br />\nlead at 10:18 of the first half<br />\nwhen Tom Myrick sent a looping<br />\npass over the Diplomat defenders<br />\nfrom midfield. Greg Cunningham<br />\n<br />\ntook the pass which resulted in a<br />\nclear break away. He wisely drew<br />\nthe F and M goalie out of the net<br />\nand went around him, putting<br />\nthe ball in the unguarded cage.<br />\nThe score remained 2-0 as tbe<br />\nfirst half ended.<br />\nThe offensive tandem of Larry<br />\nMcGowan and Steve Galloway<br />\nscored the remaining two goals<br />\nfor the Jays.<br />\nWith fourteen minutes gone in<br />\nthe second half, Cunningham,<br />\nMcGowan, and Galloway broke<br />\nin on the opposing goal with<br />\nGalloway in control of the ball.<br />\nJust in front of the cage,<br />\nGalloway fed McGowan with a<br />\npicture pass on the left side of<br />\nthe Diplomat goalie. Larry<br />\nboomed a shot that found its<br />\nway into the upper right hand<br />\ncorner of the net.<br />\nThe final tally came seven<br />\nminutes later when the second<br />\nstring goalie for F and M<br />\nmishandled a Blue Jay shot<br />\nallowing Galloway<br />\nt\u00e7 gain<br />\ncontrol of the loose ball. Again, a<br />\ncross feed to McGowan on the<br />\nleft resulted in a shot that went<br />\ninto the untended cage for the<br />\n4-0 victory.<br />\n\"We were very impressive out<br />\nthere today,\" commented Coach<br />\nBob Oliver. \"It was indicative of<br />\nthe way we can play when we are<br />\nall physically healthy. Franklin<br />\nand Marshall was 4-1 coming<br />\ninto this game. We certainly were<br />\nnot playing any pussy cats<br />\ntoday'.<br />\nThe Blue Jays record now<br />\nstands at 3-3-1 with their next<br />\ncontest to be held this<br />\nWednesday at Widener College.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nLast week's winner: Jim Thompson.

Riggs Griffith,<br />\nassistant treasurer for Hopkins<br />\nand the person in charge of the<br />\ninvestigation, said that he talked<br />\nto both the head of First<br />\nNational's international<br /><br />\ndepartment and to Sam Monroe,<br />\na vice-president of the bank.\"We<br />\ntalked last week and again today.<br />\nWe feel that they are not<br />\nparticipating in any<br />\ndiscriminatory practices<br />\ncomplying with the Arab boycott<br />\nof Israeli firms.\"<br />\nGriffith explained it is his<br />\nunderstanding that First National<br />\nacted only as a financial<br />\nintermediary between Arab firms<br />\nand U.S. enterprises. First<br />\nNational compares its activity<br />\nwith the post office and<br />\ntelephone company, Griffith<br />\nsaid. They contend that they<br />\nmerely clear letters of credit<br />\nwhich transfer funds between<br />\nforeign and U.S. banks. A<br />\nspokesman for the bank added<br />\nthat it has processed \"relatively<br />\nfew\" letters of credit and has<br />\nreported all of them to the<br /><br />\nCommerce Department.<br />\nClaiming that they are not<br />\ndirectly involved with Arab<br />\nfirms, many banks, like First<br />\nNational, have been<br />\nunderstandably upset at the<br />\nimplication that they have taken<br />\nan active participatory role in the<br />\nArab boycott. Recently, the<br />\nAdministration has opened to the<br />\npublic reports from American<br />\nfirms of Arab requests pertaining<br />\nto the boycott. The firms, such<br />\nas First National, must regularly<br />\nreport all such activity to the<br />\nCommerce Department. Firms<br />\nreporting, but not honoring Arab<br />\nrequests, have had charges of<br />\ncomplicity leveled against them.<br />\nAccording to the University,<br />\nFirst National received several<br />\nrequests from Arab groups asking<br />\nthat Israeli goods be boycotted.<br />\nIn many instances, the requests<br /><br />\naccompanied Arab letters of<br />\ncredit. Griffith said, however,<br />\nthat in each case the bank<br />\nreported the discriminatory<br />\nrequests to the government.<br />\nApparently acting on orders<br />\nfrom her superiors, Bernadette<br />\nCampitelli, Homewood branch<br />\nmanager, refused comment. Mrs.<br />\nCampitelli initially refused to<br />\ndisclose her first name to a<br />\nreporter. When pressed, she<br />\nobliged, stating, \"I really don't<br />\nsee why it's necessary, but<br />\nit's....\"<br />\nMrs. Campitelli had Howard<br />\nWilly, a regional officer for the<br />\nbank, do the explaining for her.<br />\nDescribing the Arab implication<br />\nas an \"unfortunate event,\" Willy<br />\nmade available a press release<br />\nfrom First National Chairman of<br />\nthe Board and President J.

The Black Student Union (BSU) does not feel it<br />\ncan sit back and allow the showing of a film which they<br />\nconsider \"offensive and inflammatory.\" To be blunt, the<br />\nBSU is Making charges of racism.<br />\nNo one in their right mind wants to be called a racist: the<br />\nFilm series organizers are waging a feisty battle by publicizing<br />\nfavorable criticism of the movie, voicing the dangers of<br />\nsetting such a precedent of censorship, and pleading for the<br />\nindividual's right to make up his or her own mind. They're<br />\ntaking the First Amendment route: screaming bloody murder<br />\nthat students' civil rights are being infringed upon.<br />\nIn all fairness, it should be said that the Student Council<br />\n(SC) has been placed in a precarious double-bind situation.<br />\nNo one wants to be called a censor. The SC decision,<br />\nhowever, should reflect the true majority opinion of the<br />\nstudentry, not the feelings of special interest groups or the<br />\nviews of the individual officer. That is what representative<br />\ngovernment is all- about.<br />\nAfter the original vote to show the film, everybody's<br />\nfriend, Jakie Hall, decided to get involved. Behind the<br />\nambiguous rhetoric of Dean Hall, it is easy to see his<br />\npartisanship Jakie wants the SC to vote again and make the<br />\nright decision.<br />\nIn ,his controversy, the fault is distributed equally among<br />\nall the parties involved.<br />\nThe BSU has waited too long to make this an -effective<br />\nissue. The Film Series program was made public the, first<br />\nweek of the semester: certainly there has been ample time for<br />\ncareful discussion among student representatives instead of<br />\nthis last minute rush which tends to be more emotional than<br />\nsensible.

And, again quoting<br />\nLamb, \"She is convinced of the<br />\nvalue of working within the<br />\nsystem for change.\" Feiffer is not<br />\nconvinced of this, it seems; Lamb<br />\nif pressed is not convinced of<br />\nthis; and Robin Taylor has the<br />\nunenviable job of convincing the<br />\naudience.

This calls for a great<br />\ndeal of silence, great long<br />\nstretches of inactivity on the part<br />\nof actors playing opposite the<br />\nspeeches, but there are more than<br />\nenough reasons to keep your<br />\nmouth shut when you find<br /><br />\nstatic performance, the play's<br />\nbest to this eye.

And<br />\nhis role convinces, like few<br />\nothers, that the cartoon is the<br />\nideal in this play. Steve Balog can<br />\ndo this too, though he has<br />\ntrouble sustaining a manner over<br />\nthe long stretch. His conviction<br />\nimproved considerably between<br />\nThursday and Saturday, and is<br />\nlikely to improve even more.

We<br />\nare set free from representational<br />\nrealism with a vengeance not<br />\nachieved again until the final<br />\nmoments of the play. In the<br />\nintervening pages, only<br />\nLieutenant Practice and the<br />\nfamily's fawning abhorrence at<br />\nhim come close. Patsy's<br />\nmomentary nihilism comes<br />\ncloser.<br />\nBut too much has been said<br />\nabout the script already.

This duo<br />\nconnected for six completions<br />\naccounting for over 130 yards<br />\nand two touchdowns.<br />\nThe Jays began their seering<br />\nblitz early in the third quarter.<br />\nTaking the second half kickoff at<br />\ntheir own thirty-one, JHU<br />\npromptly marched downfield to<br />\ntie the game. The drive was<br />\naccomplished mainly on the<br />\noverland route with halfback<br />\nJohn Railey going the final two<br />\nyards for the score. The<br />\ntwo-point conversion was not<br />\nsuccessful (the first of four such<br />\nfailures) and the count was 6-6.<br />\nOn the next Blue Jay offensive<br />\nseries, the Bender-Emala show<br />\nbegan. With a first and ten on the<br />\nGeorgetown 48, the quarterback<br />\nhit his favorite receiver with a<br />\npass that covered all the way to<br />\nthe Georgetown 2 yard line. Two<br />\nplays later, Railey scored his<br />\nsecond six-pointer and the Jays<br />\nwere ahead for good, 12-6.<br /><br />\nFollowing a Hoya punt,<br />\nBender and Emala continued<br />\ntheir assault on the Georgetown<br />\ndefense. Again on first down,<br />\nBender faded back to pass. This<br />\ntime, he hit Emala with a 64-yard<br />\ntouchdown pass, giving Hopkins<br />\nan 18-6 lead early in the fourth<br />\nquarter.<br />\nLeading by twelve points with<br />\nless than 12 minutes left in the<br />\ngame, it appeared as though<br />\nHopkins would breeze to victory.<br />\nHowever, such was not the case.<br />\nThe home team took the<br />\nkickoff following the latest Blue<br />\nJay score and began to march.<br />\nAided by a crucial (and<br />\nquestionable) penalty,<br />\nGeorgetown moved to a first<br />\ndown at the Jay 3-yard line. Two<br />\nplays later the Hoyas crossed the<br />\ngoal line and the accompanying<br />\nextra point made the score<br />\nuncomfortably close at 18-13.<br />\nForcing a Blue Jay punt,<br />\nGeorgetown got the ball back<br />\nwith less than four minutes<br />\nremaining in the game and<br />\nvictory still very much within the<br />\nrealm of possibility. However,<br />\nthe JHU defense proved equal to<br />\nthe task and came up with the<br />\nbig play.<br />\nOn second down, linebacker<br />\nKen Mills picked off a pass and<br />\nraced all the way to the<br />\nGeorgetown 9-yard line. Four<br />\nplays later, Bender hit Emala<br />\nwith a one-yard scoring toss and<br />\nthe Jays had their second victory<br />\nin five starts.<br />\nAfter the game, Cox gave his<br />\nline much of the credit for the<br />\noverall improvement of the<br />\noffensive play.<br /><br />\nCONTEST<br />\nMy guess is<br /><br />\n(Hopkins)<br /><br />\n(Moravian)<br /><br />\nWinner recieves a case of Beck's imported beer and a handsome<br />\nBeck's beer mug.<br />\nName<br /><br />\nAddress<br />\nI certify that I am 18 years or older.<br />\nFill out and bring to News-Letter office or mail to Box 1230<br />\nno later than Thursday, October 28,1976.<br />\nNOTE: If more than one person guesses the correct score, a<br />\nblindfold drawing of all correct scores will be held by this<br />\npublication. The entry selected will be declared the winner.<br /><br />\n\"The offensive line had their<br />\nbest game so far this year,\" the<br />\nCoach noted. \"They fired out<br />\nand blocked real well.\"<br />\nHigh Mentor<br />\nThe Blue Jay football mentor<br />\nalso had high praise for his<br />\ndefensive unit. Mills' interception<br />\nwas one of four opposing passes<br />\npilfered by Blue Jay defenders<br />\nand Cox lauded the defense for a<br />\nnear flawless performance. The<br />\nlone flaw in the defensive effort<br /><br />\noccurred early in the opening<br />\nperiod and paved the way for the<br />\ngame's first touchdown.<br />\nOn a second and ten situation<br />\nat the Georgetown thirty, a Hoya<br />\nrunning back took a pitchout and<br />\nrambled untouched around right<br />\nend for seventy yards and a<br />\ntouchdown. The extra point was<br />\nmissed, however, and the score<br />\nremained at 6-0.<br />\nAccording to Coach Cox, the<br />\ntouchdown run was the result of<br /><br />\nDown F&amp;M 4-0<br /><br />\na defensive breakdown.<br />\n\"Two men- a linebacker and a<br />\nsafety- were responsible for that<br />\nman,\" Cox later said, \"and they<br />\njust didn't do the job.\"<br />\nTalkie<br />\nThe score remained at 6-0 for<br />\nthe rest of the first two quarters,<br />\nalthough the Jays had several<br />\nexcellent chances to take the<br />\nlead.

Steve Galloway, who<br />\nhad just returned to the field<br />\nfollowing a minor injury, took a<br />\npass from center forward Greg<br />\nCunningham in front of the net<br />\nand put the ball in for the 1-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nThe Diplomats came close to<br />\nty ing the score minutes later<br />\nwhen a two man break developed<br />\nin the Hopkins' end of the,field.<br />\nTwo F and M attackmen were led<br />\nbeautifully with a pass by a<br />\nDiplomat back and came in on<br />\ngoalie Suesse in a two on one<br />\nadvantage. The Jay goalie was<br />\nforced to come out of the net to<br />\ncut down the shot angle and in<br />\ndoing so he was able to intercept<br />\na cross pass, thus halting the<br />\nthreat.<br />\nThe Blue Jays opened up their<br />\nlead at 10:18 of the first half<br />\nwhen Tom Myrick sent a looping<br />\npass over the Diplomat defenders<br />\nfrom midfield. Greg Cunningham<br /><br />\ntook the pass which resulted in a<br />\nclear break away. He wisely drew<br />\nthe F and M goalie out of the net<br />\nand went around him, putting<br />\nthe ball in the unguarded cage.<br />\nThe score remained 2-0 as tbe<br />\nfirst half ended.<br />\nThe offensive tandem of Larry<br />\nMcGowan and Steve Galloway<br />\nscored the remaining two goals<br />\nfor the Jays.<br />\nWith fourteen minutes gone in<br />\nthe second half, Cunningham,<br />\nMcGowan, and Galloway broke<br />\nin on the opposing goal with<br />\nGalloway in control of the ball.<br />\nJust in front of the cage,<br />\nGalloway fed McGowan with a<br />\npicture pass on the left side of<br />\nthe Diplomat goalie. Larry<br />\nboomed a shot that found its<br />\nway into the upper right hand<br />\ncorner of the net.<br />\nThe final tally came seven<br />\nminutes later when the second<br />\nstring goalie for F and M<br />\nmishandled a Blue Jay shot<br />\nallowing Galloway<br />\nt\u00e7 gain<br />\ncontrol of the loose ball. Again, a<br />\ncross feed to McGowan on the<br />\nleft resulted in a shot that went<br />\ninto the untended cage for the<br />\n4-0 victory.<br />\n\"We were very impressive out<br />\nthere today,\" commented Coach<br />\nBob Oliver. \"It was indicative of<br />\nthe way we can play when we are<br />\nall physically healthy. Franklin<br />\nand Marshall was 4-1 coming<br />\ninto this game. We certainly were<br />\nnot playing any pussy cats<br />\ntoday'.<br />\nThe Blue Jays record now<br />\nstands at 3-3-1 with their next<br />\ncontest to be held this<br />\nWednesday at Widener College.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nLast week's winner: Jim Thompson. His guess of 24-12 was closest<br />\nto the actual score.
