The articles will necessarily be so limited in their content<br />\nas to be able to pass the censor.<br />\nbut in all probabilty enough material will be available for publicai<br />\ntion to make the series a noteworthy one in college journalism.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is also arranging to publish a series of ar-<br />\n<br />\nAbout 100 Johns Hopkins physicians and surgeons of the necessary qualifications have volunteered for service under the American flag in France. Although, for<br />\nobvious reasons, no definite information is being given out at the<br />\nhospital, it is practically certain<br />\nthat at least fifteen of the number<br />\nwill be among the very first to<br />\nleave .for the front. Several of<br />\nthese men have already left, and<br />\nit is reported that the remainder<br />\nare rapidly preparing for departure.<br />\nIn view of the policy of the<br />\nGovernment of a speedy reinforcement of the hospital forces of the<br />\nAllies by American units, it is<br />\nconsidered very nrobable that<br />\nmany more of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nmen who have applied will be<br />\ncalled to active service in a short<br />\ntime. The calls for duty come at<br />\nshort notice, so that it is impossible to predict the time or order<br />\nof the departure of the applicants.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is, however, certain to furnish a large share of<br />\nthe quota of 300 physicians and<br />\nsurgeons which Maryland will be<br />\nasked to furnish. The men who<br />\nleave now wilr serve at clearinghouses for the wounded, about 10<br />\nor 15 miles behind the battle-front.<br />\nIn addition to the regularly<br />\nqualified volunteers, many of- the<br />\nthird and fourth year students of<br />\nthe Medical School expect to serve<br />\nin different capacities at the front<br />\nduring the coming summer. A<br />\nfew have already left the city.<br />\nThis activity is entirely distinct<br />\nfrom the Johns Hopkins base hospital unit. Under the direction<br />\nof Dr. Winford Smith, of the hospital, the work of organizing and<br />\nequipping the latter is going on<br />\nsteadily, and assurance is given<br />\nthat it will be thoroughly fitted<br />\nfor efficient service.<br />\n<br />\nMembers of the Hopkins faculty are to become farmers during<br />\nthe summer months, and their<br />\nfarms are to be parts of the University grounds.<br />\nIn response to the urgent appeal of the Government that<br />\nevery available agricultural site<br />\nbe utilized, the Board of Trustees<br />\nhave granted permission for the<br />\ntilling of a large portion of the<br />\nHomewood grounds, under the direction of faculty volunteers.<br />\nThe portion of the University's<br />\ngrounds facing on the boulevard<br />\nto the rear of the Carroll Mansion is to be utilized for this purpose. The sod has already been<br />\nbroken and cultivation is to be<br />\nbegun immediately. The farm is<br />\nalso to be utilized in the work of<br />\nseveral departments of the Hopkins summer school.<br />\nIn addition to the action of the<br />\nfaculty members, a movement is<br />\non foot to form a battalion of<br />\n\"The Farm Army\" among the students of the University. One or<br />\ntwo men have already left to<br />\nwork on farms, and quite a number of others have signified their<br />\nwillingness and intention to do<br />\nso if the necessary arrangements<br />\ncan be made.<br />\nThe men who go to serve their<br />\ncountry in this way will be given<br />\nthe same privileges by the University as those who have joined<br />\nsome branch of the military or<br />\nnaval forces. That is, they will<br />\nbe given credit for the full<br />\namount of this year's work, provided that, upon their return to<br />\nthe University next fall, or whenever it may be, their average for<br />\ntheir first term is over six.

McCabe, and several noncommissioned officers of the corps,<br />\na large number of promotions will<br />\nbe in order this week, which, says<br />\nLieutenant Elliott, will be based<br />\nlargely on attendance.<br />\nThe question of attendance is<br />\none which has required the attention of the dean, as well as Lieutenant Elliott. At times recently as many as sixty men have been<br />\nabsent at one drill. Since it was<br />\nimpossible to have efficient drills<br />\nwith such grossly depleted ranks,<br />\nLieutenant Elliott, in consideration of the prevailing sentiment<br />\nthat the drills every day precluded sufficient preparation of<br />\nstudies \u2014 the supposed cause of<br />\nmany absences\u2014reduced the drills<br />\nto three a week. Moreover, the<br />\nrule was put into effect last week<br />\nthat should a student fail to make<br />\nup an absence from drill on the<br />\nfirst opportunity offered, he will<br />\nbe suspended from the University<br />\nuntil it is made up or a plausible<br />\nexcuse is presented.<br />\nIf the drills this week have the<br />\nnormal attendance, Lieutenant Elliott is going to have the members<br />\nof the corps vote on whether they<br />\nwant drills every day or only<br />\nthree days a week. It has been<br />\npointed out that several colleges<br />\n\u2014Cornell, Harvard and Princeton<br />\n\u2014hold drills lasting from six to<br />\neight hours every day, and though<br />\nsuch a plan as this is not advocated at Hopkins, it is anticipated by many that the vote will<br />\nrestore the daily drills.<br />\n<br />\nFURNITURE<br />\nDECORATIONS<br />\nDRAPERIES<br />\n343 NORTH CHARLES STREET<br />\n<br />\nLUNCH AND DINING ROOMS<br />\nOn First Floor, 322 and 324 N.

Perhaps in one<br />\nof their text-books will appear<br />\nsome such sentence as this: \"Nowhere was the depth of the fervor<br />\nwith which the United States entered the Great War evidenced<br />\nmore clearly than in the colleges<br />\nand universities; throughout the<br />\ncountry, students offered themselves to the Government with an<br />\nenthusiasm which could leave no<br />\ndoubt as to- the intellectual and<br />\nspiritual sympathy which the nation's thinking men had come to<br />\nfeel for the cause of the Allies\"\u2014<br />\nand then the book will pass on to<br />\npoint out the development of nationalism, or the cause of the<br />\nchange of ministry in England.<br />\nIn such phrases as these will our<br />\nreaction to the war be dismissed;<br />\nwe will be part of the past, the<br />\nclass which we represent but a<br />\ntiny thread in the great tapestry.<br />\nAnd yet, by that reaction, the future is to be made; as we, rudely<br />\naroused from the smugness of our<br />\npetty round, seek and seek with-<br />\n<br />\nin ourselves the cause and the<br />\n,goal, we represent, not one small<br />\nclass of men, but the intellectual<br />\nforces of the world.<br />\nAlready the throbbing exhilaration is gone; more and more, as<br />\nour time comes, the stark reality<br />\nof wholesale butchery will be<br />\nthrust before our eyes. Believing,<br />\nwith all our hearts and souls, in<br />\nthe brotherhood of man, we will<br />\nsee our nation throwing all its<br />\ntremendous resources into the development of the technique of killing; we will see great guns systematically mowing down hundreds and thousands of men not<br />\none whit different from ourselves;<br />\nour own hands may be red with<br />\nthe blood of those whom our bayonets have pierced\u2014and then, when<br />\nthe horror of it becomes almost<br />\nunbearable, when the world is but<br />\na howling pit of lust, before our<br />\neyes will flash the one word Democracy\u2014and we will go on in<br />\nthe fight knowing, as we know today, that our fight is holy.<br />\nAll things else are immaterial.<br />\nIsms have gone, finely shaded theories of life, personal ambitions\u2014<br />\nthese things are all become infinitely trivial. Shoulder to shoulder<br />\nwith the men of France and England and Russia we have embarked upon the last crusade; the<br />\nspark kindled in 1789 is sweeping<br />\nover the world\u2014from our united<br />\nranks there rises a single cry, and<br />\nby the might of that cry the promise of the centuries shall be realized.<br />\nHow many millions of us die<br />\nupon the battlefield, in a generation, will no longer matter. If<br />\nthe thing for which we strive shall<br />\nhave been achieved, we shall not<br />\nhave died in vain, but, by our<br />\ndeath, shall have left the greatest<br />\nheritage to the future which one<br />\ngeneration ever left to another.<br />\nDays of work deadly grim lie before us; but the grimness is transfigured by the light of the banner<br />\nwhich we flaunt.

Brush, who has<br />\nbeen acting dean of the college<br />\nfaculty since the retirement of<br />\nDean E. H. Griffin two years ago,<br />\nwas made dean. Dean Brush has<br />\nbeen connected' with Johns Hopkins, with the exception of one<br />\nyear, since 1894, at which time he<br />\nentered as a graduate student.<br />\nBeginning in 1899 as instructor<br />\nin French, he has served in the<br />\ncapacity of associate, associate<br />\nprofessor and finally collegiate<br />\nprofessor.<br />\nDr. E. W. Perry, who for a<br />\nwhile was a graduate student at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, has been made<br />\nprofessor of paleontology. He,<br />\ntoo, has served in the various positions on the facility from instructor to professor.<br />\nDr. R. B. Roulston and Dr. J.<br />\nT. Singewald, associates in German and economic geology, respectively, have been promoted to<br />\nassociate professorships.<br />\nFurther promotions were the<br />\nelection of Dr. H. Bateman and<br />\nDr. Gustav Gruenbaum as associates. Dr. Bateman is to be associate in mathematics instead of<br />\nlecturer, which place he now<br />\nholds. Dr. Gruenbaum will serve<br />\nin the capacity of associate in Romance languages... He will give<br />\nseveral courses in advanced and<br />\nundergraduate Italian and Spanish. These will include those<br />\ncourses now given by Associate<br />\nProfessor Shaw, who has accepted the professorship of Italian at<br />\nthe University of Toronto.<br />\nThe new members appointed to<br />\nthe faculty in the French department are Dr. E.

At the time that the debate<br />\nwas cancelled,the men had already<br />\nbeen at work for over a month and<br />\nhad practically rounded the material into final shape. As the<br />\ncancellation took place only a<br />\nfew weeks before the triangular<br />\ncontest was scheduled to take<br />\nplace, the debaters, the Council<br />\nconsidered, had gone through all<br />\nthe work without having the exhilaration .of the debate itself.<br />\nFollowing the custom inaugurated last year, in addition to the<br />\nUniversity certificates, the debaters will receive gold \"H's\" to be<br />\nworn on fob or watch chain.<br />\nThose who will receive the blue<br />\n\"H\" this year are: Alexander A.<br />\nSteinbach, Eugene A.

They will<br />\nbe of regulation size; there will<br />\nbe a space of six feet between each<br />\ncourt and a space of eleven feet<br />\non the sides of the end courts.<br />\nThere will also be a distance of<br />\neleven feet from the back line to<br />\nthe backstop, so that the players<br />\nwill have plenty of room and will<br />\nbe in no danger of running on<br />\nother courts or of crashing into<br />\nthe-backstops.<br />\nWhen the grading is completed<br />\nthe ground will be thoroughly<br />\nrolled and the top layer will be<br />\nput on.<br />\nThe old courts on Homewood<br />\nField are now being put .into<br />\nshape.

D., LL. D., professor<br />\nof the Classics in Princeton University.<br />\nOther lectures were<br />\ngiven on Wednesday and Friday<br />\nafternoons. The subject for Dr.<br />\nCapps' series is \"Formative Influences in Greek Tragedy.\"<br />\nThe lecture on Monday afternoon was an introduction to the<br />\nseries. Dr. Capps told of the different Greek plays about which<br />\nhe was going to talk and of the<br />\nperiod which these plays embraced. The subject for Dr.<br />\nCapps' lecture on Wednesday was<br />\n\"The Primitive Theatre.\"<br />\n\u2022\"The primitive theatre,\" said<br />\nDr. Capps, \"would hardly be recognized as a theatre by any of us<br />\nwho have seen the present-day<br />\ntheatres, with their beautiful<br />\nscenery and wonderful lighting<br />\neffects. The theatre in Greece had<br />\nonly one scene and this had to<br />\nstay up all of the time, regardless<br />\nof whether it was appropriate or<br />\nnot for the supposedly depicted<br />\nscene.\"<br />\nIn the third lecture, on Friday,<br />\nthe subject of which was \"Change<br />\nand Experiment,\" Dr. Capps described the improvements that<br />\nwere added to the theatre. \"There<br />\nwere five stages in the development of the Greek tragedy,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"The primitive theatre consisted of a chorus and a chorus<br />\nleader and the five stages that<br />\nbrought it to its later development<br />\nwere: first, the introduction of<br />\nthe first actor; second, the introduction of the second actor by<br />\nAeschylus; third, the introduction of the third actor by Sophocles ; fourth, the invention of the<br />\nback scene; and, fifth, the gradual<br />\nchange from simplicity to seriousness and grandeur.\"<br />\nDr.Capps then showed how that<br />\nwith only three speaking actors<br />\nallowed in any play it was always<br />\nnecessary for the actors to play<br />\nmore than one part.<br />\n\"In one play,\" Dr. Capps declared, \"the same actor was obliged to take the parts of a beautiful slim girl and a swarthy<br />\nblacksmith. In another it was<br />\nnecessary for a messenger to bring<br />\na letter on the stage telling of the<br />\ndeath of the hero, and the part of<br />\nthe messenger had to be taken by<br />\nthe same actor who had previously<br />\ntaken the part of the hero.\" .<br />\nThree more lectures are to be<br />\ngiven this week\u2014one each on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. -<br />\n<br />\nJ.

In the<br />\nfirst place, the benches are not<br />\nsuited for that purpose, no desirable place for ..study or writing<br />\nbeing provided; secondly, the lobby becomes too noisy and congested to do any real work; and,<br />\nlastly, it isn't the proper thing<br />\nto litter the floors and soil the<br />\n<br />\nwalls of such an important and<br />\npublic place in the University.<br />\nEnw is B.

The articles will necessarily be so limited in their content<br />\nas to be able to pass the censor.<br />\nbut in all probabilty enough material will be available for publicai<br />\ntion to make the series a noteworthy one in college journalism.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is also arranging to publish a series of ar-<br /><br />\nAbout 100 Johns Hopkins physicians and surgeons of the necessary qualifications have volunteered for service under the American flag in France. Although, for<br />\nobvious reasons, no definite information is being given out at the<br />\nhospital, it is practically certain<br />\nthat at least fifteen of the number<br />\nwill be among the very first to<br />\nleave .for the front. Several of<br />\nthese men have already left, and<br />\nit is reported that the remainder<br />\nare rapidly preparing for departure.<br />\nIn view of the policy of the<br />\nGovernment of a speedy reinforcement of the hospital forces of the<br />\nAllies by American units, it is<br />\nconsidered very nrobable that<br />\nmany more of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nmen who have applied will be<br />\ncalled to active service in a short<br />\ntime. The calls for duty come at<br />\nshort notice, so that it is impossible to predict the time or order<br />\nof the departure of the applicants.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is, however, certain to furnish a large share of<br />\nthe quota of 300 physicians and<br />\nsurgeons which Maryland will be<br />\nasked to furnish. The men who<br />\nleave now wilr serve at clearinghouses for the wounded, about 10<br />\nor 15 miles behind the battle-front.<br />\nIn addition to the regularly<br />\nqualified volunteers, many of- the<br />\nthird and fourth year students of<br />\nthe Medical School expect to serve<br />\nin different capacities at the front<br />\nduring the coming summer. A<br />\nfew have already left the city.<br />\nThis activity is entirely distinct<br />\nfrom the Johns Hopkins base hospital unit. Under the direction<br />\nof Dr. Winford Smith, of the hospital, the work of organizing and<br />\nequipping the latter is going on<br />\nsteadily, and assurance is given<br />\nthat it will be thoroughly fitted<br />\nfor efficient service.<br /><br />\nMembers of the Hopkins faculty are to become farmers during<br />\nthe summer months, and their<br />\nfarms are to be parts of the University grounds.<br />\nIn response to the urgent appeal of the Government that<br />\nevery available agricultural site<br />\nbe utilized, the Board of Trustees<br />\nhave granted permission for the<br />\ntilling of a large portion of the<br />\nHomewood grounds, under the direction of faculty volunteers.<br />\nThe portion of the University's<br />\ngrounds facing on the boulevard<br />\nto the rear of the Carroll Mansion is to be utilized for this purpose. The sod has already been<br />\nbroken and cultivation is to be<br />\nbegun immediately. The farm is<br />\nalso to be utilized in the work of<br />\nseveral departments of the Hopkins summer school.<br />\nIn addition to the action of the<br />\nfaculty members, a movement is<br />\non foot to form a battalion of<br />\n\"The Farm Army\" among the students of the University. One or<br />\ntwo men have already left to<br />\nwork on farms, and quite a number of others have signified their<br />\nwillingness and intention to do<br />\nso if the necessary arrangements<br />\ncan be made.<br />\nThe men who go to serve their<br />\ncountry in this way will be given<br />\nthe same privileges by the University as those who have joined<br />\nsome branch of the military or<br />\nnaval forces. That is, they will<br />\nbe given credit for the full<br />\namount of this year's work, provided that, upon their return to<br />\nthe University next fall, or whenever it may be, their average for<br />\ntheir first term is over six.

McCabe, and several noncommissioned officers of the corps,<br />\na large number of promotions will<br />\nbe in order this week, which, says<br />\nLieutenant Elliott, will be based<br />\nlargely on attendance.<br />\nThe question of attendance is<br />\none which has required the attention of the dean, as well as Lieutenant Elliott. At times recently as many as sixty men have been<br />\nabsent at one drill. Since it was<br />\nimpossible to have efficient drills<br />\nwith such grossly depleted ranks,<br />\nLieutenant Elliott, in consideration of the prevailing sentiment<br />\nthat the drills every day precluded sufficient preparation of<br />\nstudies \u2014 the supposed cause of<br />\nmany absences\u2014reduced the drills<br />\nto three a week. Moreover, the<br />\nrule was put into effect last week<br />\nthat should a student fail to make<br />\nup an absence from drill on the<br />\nfirst opportunity offered, he will<br />\nbe suspended from the University<br />\nuntil it is made up or a plausible<br />\nexcuse is presented.<br />\nIf the drills this week have the<br />\nnormal attendance, Lieutenant Elliott is going to have the members<br />\nof the corps vote on whether they<br />\nwant drills every day or only<br />\nthree days a week. It has been<br />\npointed out that several colleges<br />\n\u2014Cornell, Harvard and Princeton<br />\n\u2014hold drills lasting from six to<br />\neight hours every day, and though<br />\nsuch a plan as this is not advocated at Hopkins, it is anticipated by many that the vote will<br />\nrestore the daily drills.<br /><br />\nFURNITURE<br />\nDECORATIONS<br />\nDRAPERIES<br />\n343 NORTH CHARLES STREET<br /><br />\nLUNCH AND DINING ROOMS<br />\nOn First Floor, 322 and 324 N.

Perhaps in one<br />\nof their text-books will appear<br />\nsome such sentence as this: \"Nowhere was the depth of the fervor<br />\nwith which the United States entered the Great War evidenced<br />\nmore clearly than in the colleges<br />\nand universities; throughout the<br />\ncountry, students offered themselves to the Government with an<br />\nenthusiasm which could leave no<br />\ndoubt as to- the intellectual and<br />\nspiritual sympathy which the nation's thinking men had come to<br />\nfeel for the cause of the Allies\"\u2014<br />\nand then the book will pass on to<br />\npoint out the development of nationalism, or the cause of the<br />\nchange of ministry in England.<br />\nIn such phrases as these will our<br />\nreaction to the war be dismissed;<br />\nwe will be part of the past, the<br />\nclass which we represent but a<br />\ntiny thread in the great tapestry.<br />\nAnd yet, by that reaction, the future is to be made; as we, rudely<br />\naroused from the smugness of our<br />\npetty round, seek and seek with-<br /><br />\nin ourselves the cause and the<br />\n,goal, we represent, not one small<br />\nclass of men, but the intellectual<br />\nforces of the world.<br />\nAlready the throbbing exhilaration is gone; more and more, as<br />\nour time comes, the stark reality<br />\nof wholesale butchery will be<br />\nthrust before our eyes. Believing,<br />\nwith all our hearts and souls, in<br />\nthe brotherhood of man, we will<br />\nsee our nation throwing all its<br />\ntremendous resources into the development of the technique of killing; we will see great guns systematically mowing down hundreds and thousands of men not<br />\none whit different from ourselves;<br />\nour own hands may be red with<br />\nthe blood of those whom our bayonets have pierced\u2014and then, when<br />\nthe horror of it becomes almost<br />\nunbearable, when the world is but<br />\na howling pit of lust, before our<br />\neyes will flash the one word Democracy\u2014and we will go on in<br />\nthe fight knowing, as we know today, that our fight is holy.<br />\nAll things else are immaterial.<br />\nIsms have gone, finely shaded theories of life, personal ambitions\u2014<br />\nthese things are all become infinitely trivial. Shoulder to shoulder<br />\nwith the men of France and England and Russia we have embarked upon the last crusade; the<br />\nspark kindled in 1789 is sweeping<br />\nover the world\u2014from our united<br />\nranks there rises a single cry, and<br />\nby the might of that cry the promise of the centuries shall be realized.<br />\nHow many millions of us die<br />\nupon the battlefield, in a generation, will no longer matter. If<br />\nthe thing for which we strive shall<br />\nhave been achieved, we shall not<br />\nhave died in vain, but, by our<br />\ndeath, shall have left the greatest<br />\nheritage to the future which one<br />\ngeneration ever left to another.<br />\nDays of work deadly grim lie before us; but the grimness is transfigured by the light of the banner<br />\nwhich we flaunt. We make war<br />\nnot that a -nation may be crushed,<br />\nbut that it may see that light.<br />\nWith the banner of democracy<br />\nabove us, there can be no defeat\u2014<br />\nfor it is the banner of mankind.<br />\nHopkins Alumnus Marries.<br /><br />\nMr. George P.

Brush, who has<br />\nbeen acting dean of the college<br />\nfaculty since the retirement of<br />\nDean E. H. Griffin two years ago,<br />\nwas made dean. Dean Brush has<br />\nbeen connected' with Johns Hopkins, with the exception of one<br />\nyear, since 1894, at which time he<br />\nentered as a graduate student.<br />\nBeginning in 1899 as instructor<br />\nin French, he has served in the<br />\ncapacity of associate, associate<br />\nprofessor and finally collegiate<br />\nprofessor.<br />\nDr. E. W. Perry, who for a<br />\nwhile was a graduate student at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, has been made<br />\nprofessor of paleontology. He,<br />\ntoo, has served in the various positions on the facility from instructor to professor.<br />\nDr. R. B. Roulston and Dr. J.<br />\nT. Singewald, associates in German and economic geology, respectively, have been promoted to<br />\nassociate professorships.<br />\nFurther promotions were the<br />\nelection of Dr. H.

Dr. Gruenbaum will serve<br />\nin the capacity of associate in Romance languages... He will give<br />\nseveral courses in advanced and<br />\nundergraduate Italian and Spanish. These will include those<br />\ncourses now given by Associate<br />\nProfessor Shaw, who has accepted the professorship of Italian at<br />\nthe University of Toronto.<br />\nThe new members appointed to<br />\nthe faculty in the French department are Dr. E.

At the time that the debate<br />\nwas cancelled,the men had already<br />\nbeen at work for over a month and<br />\nhad practically rounded the material into final shape. As the<br />\ncancellation took place only a<br />\nfew weeks before the triangular<br />\ncontest was scheduled to take<br />\nplace, the debaters, the Council<br />\nconsidered, had gone through all<br />\nthe work without having the exhilaration .of the debate itself.<br />\nFollowing the custom inaugurated last year, in addition to the<br />\nUniversity certificates, the debaters will receive gold \"H's\" to be<br />\nworn on fob or watch chain.<br />\nThose who will receive the blue<br />\n\"H\" this year are: Alexander A.<br />\nSteinbach, Eugene A.

They will<br />\nbe of regulation size; there will<br />\nbe a space of six feet between each<br />\ncourt and a space of eleven feet<br />\non the sides of the end courts.<br />\nThere will also be a distance of<br />\neleven feet from the back line to<br />\nthe backstop, so that the players<br />\nwill have plenty of room and will<br />\nbe in no danger of running on<br />\nother courts or of crashing into<br />\nthe-backstops.<br />\nWhen the grading is completed<br />\nthe ground will be thoroughly<br />\nrolled and the top layer will be<br />\nput on.<br />\nThe old courts on Homewood<br />\nField are now being put .into<br />\nshape. One has been completed<br />\nand is ready for use, and the<br />\nothers will be finished within a<br />\nfew days.<br /><br />\nThe first lecture under the<br />\nPercy Turnbull Memorial Leetures on Poetry Foundation was<br />\ngiven on Monday, April 30, in the<br />\nlecture-room of the Civil Engineering Building by Edward<br />\nCapps, Ph. D., LL. D., professor<br />\nof the Classics in Princeton University.<br />\nOther lectures were<br />\ngiven on Wednesday and Friday<br />\nafternoons. The subject for Dr.<br />\nCapps' series is \"Formative Influences in Greek Tragedy.\"<br />\nThe lecture on Monday afternoon was an introduction to the<br />\nseries. Dr. Capps told of the different Greek plays about which<br />\nhe was going to talk and of the<br />\nperiod which these plays embraced. The subject for Dr.<br />\nCapps' lecture on Wednesday was<br />\n\"The Primitive Theatre.\"<br />\n\u2022\"The primitive theatre,\" said<br />\nDr. Capps, \"would hardly be recognized as a theatre by any of us<br />\nwho have seen the present-day<br />\ntheatres, with their beautiful<br />\nscenery and wonderful lighting<br />\neffects. The theatre in Greece had<br />\nonly one scene and this had to<br />\nstay up all of the time, regardless<br />\nof whether it was appropriate or<br />\nnot for the supposedly depicted<br />\nscene.\"<br />\nIn the third lecture, on Friday,<br />\nthe subject of which was \"Change<br />\nand Experiment,\" Dr. Capps described the improvements that<br />\nwere added to the theatre. \"There<br />\nwere five stages in the development of the Greek tragedy,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"The primitive theatre consisted of a chorus and a chorus<br />\nleader and the five stages that<br />\nbrought it to its later development<br />\nwere: first, the introduction of<br />\nthe first actor; second, the introduction of the second actor by<br />\nAeschylus; third, the introduction of the third actor by Sophocles ; fourth, the invention of the<br />\nback scene; and, fifth, the gradual<br />\nchange from simplicity to seriousness and grandeur.\"<br />\nDr.Capps then showed how that<br />\nwith only three speaking actors<br />\nallowed in any play it was always<br />\nnecessary for the actors to play<br />\nmore than one part.<br />\n\"In one play,\" Dr. Capps declared, \"the same actor was obliged to take the parts of a beautiful slim girl and a swarthy<br />\nblacksmith. In another it was<br />\nnecessary for a messenger to bring<br />\na letter on the stage telling of the<br />\ndeath of the hero, and the part of<br />\nthe messenger had to be taken by<br />\nthe same actor who had previously<br />\ntaken the part of the hero.\" .<br />\nThree more lectures are to be<br />\ngiven this week\u2014one each on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. -<br /><br />\nJ.

Of<br />\nsuch I might mention a few which<br />\nI acquired myself in the several<br />\nlocalities to which I was sent<br />\n(my best district was that surrounding the Belair Market); for<br />\ninstance, that husbands of a certain clash never stay at home in<br />\nthe evening and that their wives<br />\n(like the Wif of Bath) like to<br />\ntell their tronbles even to strangers; that saloon-keepers are, on<br />\nthe whole, very pleasant fellows,<br />\nand, according to their own statements, give large sums to the<br />\npoor; that no one is at present<br />\n.making any money; that many<br />\nfirms have already contributed so<br />\nmuch to charity that they are on<br />\nthe verge of collapse; that the<br />\nbusiness world is somewhat like<br />\na large family, and'one is made<br />\nto feel at home in it by being<br />\naddressed as \"son\" by the older<br />\nmen and \"brother\" by the younger (unless one is himself stuck<br />\nfor a dime by some curbstone<br />\nbroker, in. which case he is called<br />\n\"my sweet young gentleman\");<br />\nthat poetry may flourish even in<br />\na junk-shop, as is evidenced by<br />\nthe following impromptu couplet\u2014<br />\n\"Buziness is on de bum,<br />\nAnd I must look out for No. 1.\"<br />\nIn addition to the canvassing,<br />\nthere is the daily free lunch (not<br />\nin the popular sense) on the top<br />\nfloor of the Gas and Electric<br />\nBuilding, when all teams meet to<br />\nreport progress and to join in a<br />\ntruly \u2022 representative municipal<br />\ngathering, where what is lacking;<br />\nin food is made up in good fellowship. At these lunches one meets<br />\nthe leading men of the city, as<br />\nwell as mere \"regular fellers\" like<br />\nhimself; and by skillful engineering he may even succeed in getting<br />\nhis seat next to that of a Goucher<br />\ngirl (a chance for our young engineers, civil preferred), in which<br />\ncase formality and dignity are<br />\nlaid aside, one exchanges the butter for the sugar, and may ex-<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, MAY 7, 1917.<br />\npect to be greeted the next day<br />\nwith some such friendly remark<br />\nas \"How much y' got t'day, ol'<br />\nHorn-rims?\" At lunch one may<br />\nalso listen to speeches and learn<br />\nhow not to make them and a lot<br />\nof other things; even the faculty<br />\nmay profit here by seeing ourselves as others see us and may<br />\nenjoy hearing humorous comments of the same flattering nature as those we can't quite overhear in the classroom. Altogether<br />\nthe noon gatherings are very good<br />\nfun.<br />\nAll these things are distinctly<br />\nworth while; they are pleasant<br />\nand instructive; they contribute<br />\nthe elements which college. alone<br />\ncan not offer towards the making of a well-rounded man of education and culture. But not only<br />\nfor ther own sakes should Hopkins<br />\nmen enter the work of the Balti!pre Fund. This campaign is the<br />\ngreatest thing of its kind ever<br />\nstaged in this city, and the University as a civic center should<br />\ncontribute its support. President<br />\nGoodnow is chairman of the trustees of the fund and he should<br />\nhave our whole-hearted backing.<br />\nI have communicated with headquarters and am told that a Hopkins team would be welcomed into<br />\nthe work.

Here at Homewood we have absolutely no good<br />\nplace in which we can study together. When working now tinder the more strict rules of the library, it isn't long before your<br />\nshoulder feels the pencil-tap of<br />\nMiss Tides, who, pointing to the<br />\nbig black \"Silence,\" gently inquires if you couldn't do better<br />\nwork out in the lobby.<br />\nNow, the lobby leading to the<br />\nlibrary, in my opinion, is not the<br />\nproper place to study. In the<br />\nfirst place, the benches are not<br />\nsuited for that purpose, no desirable place for ..study or writing<br />\nbeing provided; secondly, the lobby becomes too noisy and congested to do any real work; and,<br />\nlastly, it isn't the proper thing<br />\nto litter the floors and soil the<br /><br />\nwalls of such an important and<br />\npublic place in the University.<br />\nEnw is B.
