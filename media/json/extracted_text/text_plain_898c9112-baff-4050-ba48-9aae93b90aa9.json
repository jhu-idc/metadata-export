Like most of the<br />\n<br />\nstudents we talked to, she<br />\nthought that the affiliation<br />\nbetween Hopkins and Peabody<br />\nwas a real advantage. \"Well, it<br />\nwould be nice to have stronger<br />\nacademics...Not only that, but<br />\npeople have always missed<br />\ncollege life; there's none of it<br />\nhere.

The former founded<br />\nthe Peabody Institute, and the<br />\nlatter's experience as a trustee of<br />\nthe Institute influenced his<br />\ndecision to found the Enoch<br />\nPratt Free Library. Peabody's<br />\neducational ideas also influenced<br />\nanother philanthropist, Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nFrom 1815 to 1837 Peabody<br />\nlived in Baltimore and made it<br />\nthe center of his expanding<br />\nrmreantile business. Aware that<br />\nBaltimore's cultural and<br />\neducational development had not<br />\nkept pace with its- impressive<br />\nCommercial and economic<br />\ngrowth, Peabody decided to<br />\nbring about \"the moral elevation<br />\nof the character of the society of<br />\nBaltimore\" through the<br />\nestablishment of an Institute<br />\nWhich might \"become useful<br />\ntowards the improvement of<br />\nmoral and intellectual<br />\nCulture and also towards the<br />\nenlargement and diffusion of a<br />\ntaste for the Fine Arts.\"<br />\nProvisions were made for a free<br />\nresearch and reference library.<br />\ncourses of lectures, an Academy<br />\nof Music, a Gallery of Art, and<br />\nPrizes to encourage private and<br />\nPublic school children.

The original<br />\nConservatory- building, begun in<br />\n1861, was not dedicated until<br />\n1866, and the first classes of the<br />\nAcademy (now known as the<br />\nConservatory) were not initiated<br />\nuntil 1868.<br />\nPeabody travelled to Baltimore<br />\nfor the 'dedication ceremonies.<br />\nThe seventy-one year old man<br />\nstood on the steps of the<br />\nInstitute and greeted a crowd of<br />\n20,000 , was entertained<br />\nthroughout the city, and one<br />\nnight played whist with several<br />\nfriends until one o'clock' in the<br />\nmorning.

Like most of the<br /><br />\nstudents we talked to, she<br />\nthought that the affiliation<br />\nbetween Hopkins and Peabody<br />\nwas a real advantage. \"Well, it<br />\nwould be nice to have stronger<br />\nacademics...Not only that, but<br />\npeople have always missed<br />\ncollege life; there's none of it<br />\nhere. How much could there be<br />\nin one city block?<br />\n\"And also the diversity of<br />\nstudents...well, we just have<br />\nmusic students. That would be<br />\nnice, meeting other viewpoints,<br />\nother ideas.\" But because no one<br />\nis really sure what the affiliation<br />\nwill amount to, she had a few<br />\ndoubts.\" I think every one was a<br />\nlittle frightened, with Hopkins,<br />\nbeing what it is academically,<br />\neverybody would be put under<br />\nmore stress in the non-music<br />\nsubjects.\" As of yet, though, she<br />\nhasn't heard of any course or<br />\nrequirement changes. \"Really<br />\nI've heard very little; people are<br />\njust waiting to see what happens<br />\nnext year.

It's<br />\na crime that Kubrick feels he can<br />\nget away with this bit of<br />\nchicanery without Filling in the<br />\nblanks between pre-history and<br />\nfuture history. The black<br />\nmonolith (around which the film<br />\nrevolves) is too much an<br />\ningredient from science fiction to<br />\nraise the movie out of the science<br />\nfiction genre. Like the intricate<br />\nshots and sets inside the<br />\nspaceship, the monolith is a great<br />\nvisual image. but what does it<br />\nmean? Why must Kubrick be so<br />\ncoy in letting the audience know<br />\nWhat's going on? I suspect that<br />\nKubrick himself hasn't the<br />\nfaintest idea what's happening<br />\n.;ither, so he devised a strategy to<br />\nkeep the viewer's mind off the<br />\nmeaning by presenting a series of<br />\nimages you just sit back and<br />\nadmire and think, \"How the hell<br />\ndid he get that shot?\"<br />\nThis is the major flaw in<br />\n2001\u2014Kubrick took a simplistic<br />\nand paranoic view of the future.<br />\nHe's condemning technology, but<br />\nat the same time he's relying<br />\nheavily on technology to<br />\nconstruct his movie. He takes a<br />\nrather cavalier, adolescent view<br />\nof man's relationship to<br />\ntechnology\u2014if we don't watch<br />\nourselves, technology might rule<br />\nour lives, but in the end, man will<br />\ntriumph anyway. Kubrick does<br />\nnot face up to the problem; he<br />\ndoesn't offer any solutions. If<br />\nonly Kubrick had taken more<br />\ncare with the script, 2001 might<br />\nhave been a truly great cinematic<br />\nachievement rather than the<br />\nbrilliant visual treat it is.<br />\nJOHN GACII BO<br /><br />\nhtilIOP<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE'S LANG CST<br /><br />\nAl Lump Csab Cakes<br />\nGenuine Rooker Corned Beef<br />\nDdicioris Roast Beef<br />\nVirginia Baked Ham<br />\nVarious Cold Cuts<br />\nCheese (Swiss.

The former founded<br />\nthe Peabody Institute, and the<br />\nlatter's experience as a trustee of<br />\nthe Institute influenced his<br />\ndecision to found the Enoch<br />\nPratt Free Library. Peabody's<br />\neducational ideas also influenced<br />\nanother philanthropist, Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nFrom 1815 to 1837 Peabody<br />\nlived in Baltimore and made it<br />\nthe center of his expanding<br />\nrmreantile business. Aware that<br />\nBaltimore's cultural and<br />\neducational development had not<br />\nkept pace with its- impressive<br />\nCommercial and economic<br />\ngrowth, Peabody decided to<br />\nbring about \"the moral elevation<br />\nof the character of the society of<br />\nBaltimore\" through the<br />\nestablishment of an Institute<br />\nWhich might \"become useful<br />\ntowards the improvement of<br />\nmoral and intellectual<br />\nCulture and also towards the<br />\nenlargement and diffusion of a<br />\ntaste for the Fine Arts.\"<br />\nProvisions were made for a free<br />\nresearch and reference library.<br />\ncourses of lectures, an Academy<br />\nof Music, a Gallery of Art, and<br />\nPrizes to encourage private and<br />\nPublic school children. The<br />\nAcademy of Music, wrote<br />\nPeabody, was \"to furnish that<br />\nsort of instruction, under able<br />\nteachers, in the theory and higher<br />\nbranches of music, for which<br />\nthere has heretofore been no<br />\nprovision, and which students<br />\nhave been obliged to seek<br />\nabroad.\" The Peabody<br /><br />\nConservatory, modelled after the<br />\ngreat European conservatories of<br />\nmusic, remained little more than<br />\nan idea for several years:<br />\nconstruction was delayed by the<br />\nCivil War and by interal<br />\ndissension within the board of<br />\ntrustees. The original<br />\nConservatory- building, begun in<br />\n1861, was not dedicated until<br />\n1866, and the first classes of the<br />\nAcademy (now known as the<br />\nConservatory) were not initiated<br />\nuntil 1868.<br />\nPeabody travelled to Baltimore<br />\nfor the 'dedication ceremonies.<br />\nThe seventy-one year old man<br />\nstood on the steps of the<br />\nInstitute and greeted a crowd of<br />\n20,000 , was entertained<br />\nthroughout the city, and one<br />\nnight played whist with several<br />\nfriends until one o'clock' in the<br />\nmorning. These ceremonies were<br />\namong the first post-War<br />\ngatherings of Unionists and<br />\nConfederates. Peabody, who had<br />\ndemanded in an 1.857 letter that<br />\nthe Institute be free of \"sectional<br />\ntheology or party politics,\"<br />\nreiterated his opposition to<br />\nsectional differences in his 1866<br />\ndedication address: \"May this<br />\nInstitute be a common ground,<br />\nwhere all may meet, burying<br />\nformer differences and<br />\nanimosities, forgetting past<br />\nseparations and estrangements.\"<br />\nHis reception in Baltimore was<br />\nenthusiastic, but his gift to the<br />\ncity did not receive universal<br />\napprobation.
