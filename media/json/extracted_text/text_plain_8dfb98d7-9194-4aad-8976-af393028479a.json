At one point the<br />\nengrossed<br />\nbecomes<br />\nSpectator<br />\nenough to fear being stung. But<br />\nthe moment passes, the bees calm<br />\ndown and the play ends with the<br />\nassurance that the same quality<br />\nOf the same honey will be perpetually produced at the same<br />\nrate.<br />\n<br />\nThis is not to say that Campus<br />\nElections was poorly received by<br />\nIts audience. On the contrary, the<br />\nplay may well prove to be a<br />\nworthy sequel to Hopkins, highly<br />\nsuccessful Fall production of the<br />\ncomedy Dirty Rush. Like Dirty<br />\nRush, Campus Elections has all<br />\nthe essentials for popular success.<br />\nBeneath a thin veneer of rationality the play is basically mindless, requiring little mental activity on the part of its audience.<br />\nMoreover, Campus Elections is a<br />\nloud and bright production which<br />\ngives its audience a feeling of<br />\nparticipation in a carnival like<br />\natmosphere. Perhaps it wouldn't<br />\nbe going too far to say that the<br />\nplay is the off-Broadway answer<br />\n<br />\nto such crowd pleasers as Hello<br />\nDolly and Sound of Music. It's<br />\nthat bad.<br />\nExchange Program<br />\nIn essence, Campus Elections<br />\nhas no plot other than the slow<br />\nand painful exchange of titles between one class and the class<br />\nbelow it. The \"action\" begins at<br />\nvarious times and at various<br />\nplaces as each of the stereotyped<br />\ncampus politicos is visited by his<br />\nsemi-annual Joan of Arc revelation. The \"action\" ends with a<br />\ntc-mporary pause while each actor<br />\nrecaps what he has done and<br />\nplans for his performance in the<br />\nnext inevitable election.<br />\nActing out this plot of no real<br />\nbeginnings, no logical progression and no meaningful conclusion, the cast executes a near<br />\nperfect exercise in the Theater of<br />\nthe Absurd. Reciting nothing but<br />\ntheir pointless sing-song dialogue,<br />\nseveral of the actors are actually<br />\nable to give the impression that<br />\nthere is a certain real purpose<br />\nbeneath the surface of all the<br />\nmundane repetition. One can almost believe that there are real<br />\ngoals to be pursued and that<br />\nthese goals can be attained despite the continual human ineptness of those who pursue them.<br />\nUnfortunately, it is impossible<br />\nto single out the better individual<br />\nperformances of Campus Elections.

Characters are never permitted to<br />\nestablish themselves to the entire<br />\naudience at once. Nor are any of<br />\nthe characters permitted to come<br />\ninto face to face conflict and thus<br />\nmake themselves known through<br />\npublic confrontation. Instead,<br />\neach actor is identified by placards written in the same absurd<br />\nlanguage as the dialogue. The<br />\nsigns are complimented by the<br />\nmasks each player carries to disguise his face, just as the dialogue disguises his thoughts\u2014a<br />\ndevice that theatergoers have already seen in Eugene O'Neill's<br />\nStrange Interlude.

The<br />\ntechnique, known as \"audience<br />\nintimidation\", is administered by<br />\nthe actors in a furious scene that<br />\ntakes place near the end of the<br />\nplay. Just as the audience is preparing for the climax, the players<br />\ncharge off the stage and surround<br />\nindividual spectators, plead with<br />\nthem, apply the most subtle pressures and the grossest forms of<br />\ncoercion. A general feeling of fear<br />\nand revulsion spreads throughout<br />\nthe audience as individuals and<br />\nsmall groups are worked to a<br />\nfever pitch by the frenzied actors.<br />\nAnd then, quite suddenly, it is<br />\nover.

We believe that a college newspaper must<br />\nbe free from all forms of external control, both editorially and financially, to serve its readership well. Just<br />\nas we oppose administrative controls on the content of<br />\ncollege newspapers, so we believe that financial independence is a precondition for editorial autonomy.<br />\nIn recent weeks, the Readers Digest Association,<br />\nInc., through its subsidiary company, National Educational Advertising Services, from which the News-Letter<br />\nreceives kis majority of advertisement, has invited college<br />\nnewspapers to distribute a new semi-monthly puld/icalion, Cainpus Courier, as a regular supplement, beginning in late September. Campus Courier will be published by Readers Digest Association, Inc.; for distributing the supplement, college newspapers will be paid a<br />\nsubstantial sum by Readers Digest Association, Inc.<br />\nIncluded in the contents of a dummy issue of<br />\nCampus Courier, sent to several college newspapers, were<br />\nan article on early marriage by Margaret Mead, a color<br />\nspread on the surfing scene, and a reprinted article by<br />\nVice President Humphrey on his father (\"The first time<br />\nI ever saw my father weep. ...\"). In effect Campus<br />\nCourier is a slick, ehildish imitation of the already<br />\nchildish Reader's Digest.<br />\nOver fifteen college newspapers with a total circulation of more than 150,000 circulation have already<br />\nturned down the offer to distribute Campus Courier.<br />\nIn a statement issued on April 14, several college editors charged that insertation of Campus Courier in their<br />\nissues would endanger their papers both editorially and<br />\nfinancially.<br />\nThe News-Letter endorses the position of the editors<br />\nwho have rejected the Readers Digest Association, Inc.,<br />\noffer to distribute Campus Courier. We believe that distribution of the supplement by college newspapers<br />\nwould be detrimental to the interests of the college press<br />\nIn the following ways:<br />\n1. The Readers Digest Association,Inc., has said that<br />\nan editor may refuse to distribute any issue of Campus<br />\nCourier containing objectionable material.But if an editor<br />\nhas planned his budget for the year in anticipation of<br />\ndistributing Campus Courier, his ability to reject a particular issue of the supplement will he effectively limited.<br />\nShould he turn down an issue of The Campus Courier,<br />\nhe will have to print fewer pages of his newspaper because of the loss of budgeted revenue. Hence, acceptance<br />\nof the Readers Digest Association, Inc., offer of Campus<br />\nCourier will constrain the editorial freedom of this newspapers editors.<br />\n2. Rather than channeling advertising to the<br />\nCampus Courier, the Readers Digest Association, Inc.,<br />\nthe owner of National Educational Advertising Services,<br />\nwould further the News-Letter's interests more directly<br />\nby selling more advertising to it, with no strings<br />\nattached.<br />\n3. We believe that the long-run strength of the<br />\nNews-Letter depends upon the efforts of its editors and<br />\nbusiness managers themselves to improve the newspaper, both editorially and financially. Projects such as<br />\nCampus Courier will instead increase the dependence<br />\nupon external organizations, a situation whidi poses a<br />\nlong-term threat to the freedom of the college press.<br />\n<br />\nKATZ<br />\n<br />\nMotorsexual Torturers, et Al.<br />\nBy ELIA KATZ<br />\nAt Sunday, at Levering Hall,<br />\nSCORPIO RISING arrives!

At one point the<br />\nengrossed<br />\nbecomes<br />\nSpectator<br />\nenough to fear being stung. But<br />\nthe moment passes, the bees calm<br />\ndown and the play ends with the<br />\nassurance that the same quality<br />\nOf the same honey will be perpetually produced at the same<br />\nrate.<br /><br />\nThis is not to say that Campus<br />\nElections was poorly received by<br />\nIts audience. On the contrary, the<br />\nplay may well prove to be a<br />\nworthy sequel to Hopkins, highly<br />\nsuccessful Fall production of the<br />\ncomedy Dirty Rush. Like Dirty<br />\nRush, Campus Elections has all<br />\nthe essentials for popular success.<br />\nBeneath a thin veneer of rationality the play is basically mindless, requiring little mental activity on the part of its audience.<br />\nMoreover, Campus Elections is a<br />\nloud and bright production which<br />\ngives its audience a feeling of<br />\nparticipation in a carnival like<br />\natmosphere. Perhaps it wouldn't<br />\nbe going too far to say that the<br />\nplay is the off-Broadway answer<br /><br />\nto such crowd pleasers as Hello<br />\nDolly and Sound of Music. It's<br />\nthat bad.<br />\nExchange Program<br />\nIn essence, Campus Elections<br />\nhas no plot other than the slow<br />\nand painful exchange of titles between one class and the class<br />\nbelow it. The \"action\" begins at<br />\nvarious times and at various<br />\nplaces as each of the stereotyped<br />\ncampus politicos is visited by his<br />\nsemi-annual Joan of Arc revelation. The \"action\" ends with a<br />\ntc-mporary pause while each actor<br />\nrecaps what he has done and<br />\nplans for his performance in the<br />\nnext inevitable election.<br />\nActing out this plot of no real<br />\nbeginnings, no logical progression and no meaningful conclusion, the cast executes a near<br />\nperfect exercise in the Theater of<br />\nthe Absurd. Reciting nothing but<br />\ntheir pointless sing-song dialogue,<br />\nseveral of the actors are actually<br />\nable to give the impression that<br />\nthere is a certain real purpose<br />\nbeneath the surface of all the<br />\nmundane repetition. One can almost believe that there are real<br />\ngoals to be pursued and that<br />\nthese goals can be attained despite the continual human ineptness of those who pursue them.<br />\nUnfortunately, it is impossible<br />\nto single out the better individual<br />\nperformances of Campus Elections.

Instead,<br />\neach actor is identified by placards written in the same absurd<br />\nlanguage as the dialogue. The<br />\nsigns are complimented by the<br />\nmasks each player carries to disguise his face, just as the dialogue disguises his thoughts\u2014a<br />\ndevice that theatergoers have already seen in Eugene O'Neill's<br />\nStrange Interlude. However, unlike Strange Intelude, the characters in Campus Elections have<br />\nnothing but masks, their naked<br />\nfaces being the most deceiving<br />\nmasks of all.<br />\nTheater of Cruelty<br />\nIn addition to its absurdity,<br />\nCampus Elections makes use of a<br />\nadopted<br />\ntechnique<br />\nparticular<br />\nfi om the Theater of Cruelty. The<br />\ntechnique, known as \"audience<br />\nintimidation\", is administered by<br />\nthe actors in a furious scene that<br />\ntakes place near the end of the<br />\nplay. Just as the audience is preparing for the climax, the players<br />\ncharge off the stage and surround<br />\nindividual spectators, plead with<br />\nthem, apply the most subtle pressures and the grossest forms of<br />\ncoercion. A general feeling of fear<br />\nand revulsion spreads throughout<br />\nthe audience as individuals and<br />\nsmall groups are worked to a<br />\nfever pitch by the frenzied actors.<br />\nAnd then, quite suddenly, it is<br />\nover. Much faster than anyone<br />\nthought possible, a feeling of<br />\nrelief falls over the crowd. We<br />\nwonder how and why we ever<br />\nbecame so excited.

We believe that a college newspaper must<br />\nbe free from all forms of external control, both editorially and financially, to serve its readership well. Just<br />\nas we oppose administrative controls on the content of<br />\ncollege newspapers, so we believe that financial independence is a precondition for editorial autonomy.<br />\nIn recent weeks, the Readers Digest Association,<br />\nInc., through its subsidiary company, National Educational Advertising Services, from which the News-Letter<br />\nreceives kis majority of advertisement, has invited college<br />\nnewspapers to distribute a new semi-monthly puld/icalion, Cainpus Courier, as a regular supplement, beginning in late September. Campus Courier will be published by Readers Digest Association, Inc.; for distributing the supplement, college newspapers will be paid a<br />\nsubstantial sum by Readers Digest Association, Inc.<br />\nIncluded in the contents of a dummy issue of<br />\nCampus Courier, sent to several college newspapers, were<br />\nan article on early marriage by Margaret Mead, a color<br />\nspread on the surfing scene, and a reprinted article by<br />\nVice President Humphrey on his father (\"The first time<br />\nI ever saw my father weep. ...\"). In effect Campus<br />\nCourier is a slick, ehildish imitation of the already<br />\nchildish Reader's Digest.<br />\nOver fifteen college newspapers with a total circulation of more than 150,000 circulation have already<br />\nturned down the offer to distribute Campus Courier.<br />\nIn a statement issued on April 14, several college editors charged that insertation of Campus Courier in their<br />\nissues would endanger their papers both editorially and<br />\nfinancially.<br />\nThe News-Letter endorses the position of the editors<br />\nwho have rejected the Readers Digest Association, Inc.,<br />\noffer to distribute Campus Courier. We believe that distribution of the supplement by college newspapers<br />\nwould be detrimental to the interests of the college press<br />\nIn the following ways:<br />\n1. The Readers Digest Association,Inc., has said that<br />\nan editor may refuse to distribute any issue of Campus<br />\nCourier containing objectionable material.But if an editor<br />\nhas planned his budget for the year in anticipation of<br />\ndistributing Campus Courier, his ability to reject a particular issue of the supplement will he effectively limited.<br />\nShould he turn down an issue of The Campus Courier,<br />\nhe will have to print fewer pages of his newspaper because of the loss of budgeted revenue. Hence, acceptance<br />\nof the Readers Digest Association, Inc., offer of Campus<br />\nCourier will constrain the editorial freedom of this newspapers editors.<br />\n2. Rather than channeling advertising to the<br />\nCampus Courier, the Readers Digest Association, Inc.,<br />\nthe owner of National Educational Advertising Services,<br />\nwould further the News-Letter's interests more directly<br />\nby selling more advertising to it, with no strings<br />\nattached.<br />\n3. We believe that the long-run strength of the<br />\nNews-Letter depends upon the efforts of its editors and<br />\nbusiness managers themselves to improve the newspaper, both editorially and financially. Projects such as<br />\nCampus Courier will instead increase the dependence<br />\nupon external organizations, a situation whidi poses a<br />\nlong-term threat to the freedom of the college press.<br /><br />\nKATZ<br /><br />\nMotorsexual Torturers, et Al.<br />\nBy ELIA KATZ<br />\nAt Sunday, at Levering Hall,<br />\nSCORPIO RISING arrives!

It is<br />\nrather that he understands fully<br />\nthe power of music, and utilizes<br />\nall his ability to convey it to his<br />\nlisteners.<br />\nFrom the moment Rostropovich sets his bow on the string,<br />\none realizes that there is an artist<br />\nin complete control of his instrument. The next revelation is the<br />\nbeauty and endless variety of the<br />\nsounds produced by his cello\u2014<br />\nfrom the deep, godlike utterances<br />\nof the Brahms sonata to the rich<br />\nsonorities of the Bach suite to<br />\nthe wolf-whistle and virtuoso<br />\nguitar effects in the Britten<br />\nsonata. One expects to watch brilliant technical feats and to hear<br />\nbeautiful sounds from a virtuoso.<br />\nBut Rostropovich offers much<br />\nmore than this. His demeanor on<br />\nstage and his rapport with the<br />\nsounds he produces seem to say<br />\nto the audience,\"The music I am<br />\nplaying expresses all that is noble<br />\nand good in men. I feel it deeply<br />\nand sincerely, and I want you to<br />\nexperience it too.

Since it was<br />\nParent's Weekend, many of the<br /><br />\nspectators were Parents.

In fact,<br />\nI was unable to find anyone who<br />\ncould say with any degree of<br />\ncertainty that they had seen the<br />\nDSRC at all. They must have<br />\nbeen there however, because<br />\nthere was a bunch of boys on the<br />\nfield who kept blocking my view<br />\nof the Bunnies. That was probably them.<br />\nThe ad hoe rules drawn up<br />\ninsisted that the boys could not<br />\ntouch the girls, but the girls<br />\ncould touch the boys. Taking advantage of these rules, the Bunnies played a rough game. In one<br />\nscrimmage, a DSRC man want to<br />\nthe ground with a scream of pain<br />\nafter receiving a sharp blow on<br />\nhis lacrosse stick. Despite the<br />\nminor mishaps, the game was<br />\nplayed with good sportmanship The girls don't seem to mind this<br />\non both sides.
