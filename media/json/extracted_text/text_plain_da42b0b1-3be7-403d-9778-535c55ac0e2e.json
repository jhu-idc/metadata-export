A new dean, they say, will help to<br />\n\"streamline\" affairs into the separate areas<br />\nof academics and non-academics. Supposedly, such changes in the system will allow<br />\nHomewood to run more smoothly and<br />\nefficiently.<br />\nA potentially negative response may result<br />\nfrom such a move. Undergraduates especially are likely to assume that this is merely<br />\nanother addition to the already confusing<br />\ntangle of bureaucracy and red tape that exists here. Another administrator may simply mean one more person to contribute to<br />\n. the sometimes perplexing policies issued<br />\nfrom the hallowed halls of Garland and<br />\nMerryman.<br />\nHowever, it might be wise to put aside our<br />\ncynicism for a moment. The new dean, who<br />\nwill hold a rank equivalent to that of Arts<br />\nand Sciences Dean Fisher and Engineering<br />\nDean Vandelinde, will have his primary<br />\nresponsibilities centered about non-academic<br />\naffairs. This will include such diverse concerns as student amenities, auxiliary enter-<br />\n<br />\nprises, the Office of the Registrar and<br />\nhousing.<br />\nObviously, students have a vested interest<br />\nin these areas and would benefit from any<br />\nimprovement in their organizational structure. The current situation demands that all<br />\nquestions concerning non-academic affairs<br />\nbe channeled through several offices, including those of Fisher and Vandelinde, who<br />\nmust then consult with one another before<br />\nreaching a decision. The process is timeconsuming and, at times, irritating to<br />\nwitness.<br />\nA single dean, however, whose principal<br />\nfocus is on auxiliary services would offer a<br />\nsignificant advantage. Non-academic activities would be addressed at the same level<br />\nas that of academic concerns. In addition,<br />\nwe would lose nothing to this development.<br />\nAcademics and non-academics alike would<br />\nreceive added attention. The administrative<br />\nhierarchy, a necessary evil, could be<br />\nimproved.<br />\nStudents should support these changes.<br />\nOur opinions and suggestions about the position should be solicited and given. There is<br />\na great deal to be gained from this decision.<br />\n<br />\nTime to Relax<br />\nSchool spirit has never been a big deal at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, especially in recent years.<br />\nWhile other colleges and universities have<br />\npep rallies, class days, spirit contests and,<br />\nyes, even a social life, Hopkins has ARA,<br />\npre-meds and the Milton Hilton. It's not that<br />\nwe don't pay attention. Rarely a day goes<br />\nby that complaints cannot be overheard concerning the social wasteland that is<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nIt would seem logical that any opportunity<br />\nto alleviate such misery would be pursued<br />\nwith great enthusiasm. A lacrosse game, say,<br />\nmight relieve those mid-semester blues and<br />\ngive one the chance to relax, enjoy the<br />\nweather and actually see fellow undergraduates without their Organic Chemistry<br />\ntexts in tow.<br />\n<br />\nIt is unlikely, however, that the Hut and<br />\nthe MSEL will be completely empty tomorrow afternoon. We fully expect that a good<br />\npercentage of our highly intelligent and grade<br />\nconscious student population will waste<br />\nprime weekend hours on D-Level.<br />\nThis is unfortunate. Contrary to popular<br />\nbelief, four years at JHU need not add up<br />\nto a wasted youth. There are certainly times<br />\nthat can be enjoyed if one has the inclination. Or the courage.<br />\nTake a chance. Pack a cooler with your<br />\nfavorite beverage and munchies and go see<br />\nthe game against Syracuse tomorrow. All<br />\nyou'd be losing is a few hours in a location<br />\nwhich dangerously resembles a medieval<br />\ndungeon.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nClarification<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to clarify the<br />\nway I represented my accomplishments as co-chair of<br />\nthe Student Services Committee<br />\nin a campaign flyer I distributed<br />\nearlier this week. The Rotunda<br />\nShuttle, the Airport Shuttle and<br />\nthe Security phone proposal<br />\nwere all worked on by the entire committee as well as myself<br />\nand my co-chairman, James<br />\nHerring. I did not mean to imply that these services were the<br />\nresult of my work alone.<br />\nAs co-chairman, I take a<br />\ngreat personal pride in<br />\n<br />\nachievements of the Student<br />\nServices Committee this year<br />\nand I am proud of the work of<br />\nevery member of the committee. What we have accomplished would not have been possible without the cooperation and<br />\ndedication of all involved. I<br />\nhope my co-chairman and the<br />\nmembers of our committee feel<br />\nthe same pride in our work.<br />\nAlison Little<br />\nCo-Chairman, Student Council<br />\nStudent Services Committee<br />\n<br />\nAnti-Bird Talk<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nI am humbled before the<br />\n<br />\nwisdom of the News-Letter's<br />\nnews editors. Last Friday, I expected to see an article on the<br />\nprogress of the anti-apartheid<br />\nmovement at JHU. I found instead more pressing news had<br />\nbeen chosen for print, exemplified by the announcement<br />\nof the birth of several rare<br />\nbirds. There are several events<br />\nthat I had foolishly expected to<br />\nbe mentioned instead. For example, since the News-Letter<br />\ncovered the first protest a<br />\nmonth ago, 23 more Hopkins<br />\nstudents have been arrested for<br />\nprotesting against apartheid<br />\nand against Johns Hopkins' investments in companies which<br />\noperate in South Africa (bring-<br />\n<br />\ning the total number of JHU<br />\narrests to 32). Over 70 JHU<br />\nstudents have picketed for the<br />\ncause, and over twenty percent<br />\nof the student body has signed<br />\na petition asking Johns<br />\nHopkins to divest. Faculty<br />\nmembers have signed as well<br />\nand will be getting arrested with<br />\nus in the near future. The<br />\nHopkins Anti-Apartheid Coalition(HAAC)has been formed,<br />\nand under it there has been an<br />\nalmost unprecedented cooperation between a large number of<br />\nstudent organizations (18 have<br />\nsigned the petition, 5 are supplying large amounts of funding and personnel). The protest is undeniably the biggest in<br />\nthe recent history of JHU. The<br />\nFebruary 22 protest (when 16<br />\nJHU students were arrested)<br />\nwas covered by the 6 o'clock<br />\nnews, several radio stations (including an interview with<br />\nHAAC officer Gillian Clark),<br />\nand the Washington Post(Feb.<br />\n23), but not, to my surprise, by<br />\nthe News-Letter. So last Friday,<br />\nI looked through the NewsLetter to see which articles the<br />\ntwo news editors thought were<br />\nmore important. One particular<br />\narticle on rare bird births<br />\ncaught my attention. I realized<br />\nhow insignificant the above<br />\ndescribed protest events were in<br />\ncomparison. I was humbled. I<br />\nam sending each of the petition<br />\nsigners, demonstrators, and arrestees a photocopy of the<br />\nGreat Tinamou featured on<br />\npage 22 of the last issue so that<br />\nthey know what is important in<br />\nthis world. I have also fired off<br />\nan angry letter to the<br />\nWashington Post, chiding them<br />\nfor writing about Johns<br />\nHopkins students when they<br />\nshould be writing about the<br />\nsilver-beaked taneger so<br />\nthoughtfully covered by the<br />\nNews-Letter in Friday's issue. I<br />\npity the Post for missing such<br />\nimportant news and thus being<br />\noutclassed in article selection by<br />\nthe News-Letter news editors<br />\nwho knew where the real news<br />\nwas to be found, the National<br />\nAquarium.<br />\nHumbly,<br />\nJim Keim<br />\nHAAC Protest Coordinator<br />\n<br />\nPoetry Comment<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhile I am pleased that the<br />\nNews-Letter reviewed the latest<br />\ncollection of Stephen Crane's<br />\nprose and poetry, I was disappointed by Mr. White's faulty<br />\nanalysis of Crane's poetic intent<br />\nand ideological persuasion. Mr.<br />\nWhite writes, \"... The Black<br />\nRiders and Other Lines is a<br />\nsearing attack on traditional<br />\nreligious values.\" Crane's<br />\npoems about the \"puffing<br />\nbraggart\" God do indeed condemn the stereotypical fundamentalist god, the god of<br />\nthose who will -rest assured<br />\nthat God is at this very moment<br />\ngleefully<br />\nroasting<br />\nMr.<br />\nCrane...\" However, this is not<br />\nan attack on traditional<br />\nreligious values; Crane's ideal<br />\nman was the Christian<br />\ngentleman.<br />\nMr. White's statement that<br />\nCrane believes \"courage has little to do with carrying a gun\"<br />\nis also misleading. Certainly<br />\nCrane's conception of courage<br />\nwas not limited to the carrying<br />\nof a gun, nor does he believe<br />\nthat all those who carry guns<br />\nare courageous, but he did<br />\nvalue courage in battle. In fact,<br />\none of the major themes in his<br />\nwritings is that of \"life as<br />\nbattle.\"<br />\nCrane wrote a number of<br />\nstories which deal explicitly<br />\nwith war, the most famous of<br />\nwhich The Red Badge of<br />\nCourage, was included in the<br />\nanthology Mr. White reviewed.<br />\nPerhaps the remembered<br />\nboredom of his high school<br />\nEnglish class caused Mr. White<br />\nto neglect to re-read this novel<br />\ncarefully: if he had, he might<br />\nhave drawn a different conclusion about Crane' attitude<br />\ntoward war. So that my objections are not dismissed as merely differences in literary interpretation, let me support my<br />\nclaims with some biographical information.

The tally is actually misleading. The three<br />\nmembers, who abstained in the<br />\nvote because they were candidates, wholeheartedly supported the Council action in<br />\ndebate\u2014the vote was de facto<br />\n13-1.<br />\nI felt that the Council's intervention was wrong because it<br />\nwent against the spirit of the<br />\nElections Commission. The<br />\n<br />\nCommission or any Board of<br />\nElections is to be independent<br />\nand free of partisan politics in<br />\norder that the Commission can<br />\nrun a fair and honest election.<br />\nIndeed the Elections Commission is not free to run with the<br />\nwind. The Council approves its<br />\nbudget each year and appoints<br />\nits members. In the case of vote<br />\nfraud or a gross incident of unfairness, I would be the first to<br />\nadvocate a Council remedy.<br />\nIn this case, however, the<br />\nCouncil saw fit to meddle with<br />\nthe EC over a scheduling issue.<br />\nSuch an action violated the integrity of the Elections<br />\nCommission.<br />\nAs for the News-Letter, it<br />\nsaw fit to cover the dramatic<br />\nresignation of Tom Rotelli as<br />\nthe main point of the debate. I<br />\ndo not defend Tom's behavior<br />\nin the least, but I find it odd<br />\nthat the News-Letter concentrated on the pomp and ignored<br />\nthe circumstance.<br />\nI hear), or have some sort<br />\nOverall, this was a disap- what<br />\nfor those warm<br />\nventilation<br />\nof<br />\npointing show by the Council.<br />\ndays?<br />\nMy only hope is that next year's<br />\nThen there's Levering.

Having followed<br />\nRevel's work for some time, I<br />\nwas surprised to see that the<br />\nreview ran under the headings<br />\n\"Democracy's Shortfalls: A<br />\nConservative's View\" and<br />\n\"Revel's Conservatism.\" Mr.<br />\nZucker, in spite of having supposedly read Revel's work,<br />\nseems to be completely unaware<br />\nthat Jean-Francois revel is, and<br />\nhas long been, a well-known<br />\nFrench socialist.<br />\nIn his 1970 work Without<br />\nMarx or Jesus, Revel writes<br />\nthat\" .the American Left is<br />\nprobably the world's only hope<br />\nfor a revolution that will save<br />\nit from destruction.\" He also<br />\nsets forth his\"... program for<br />\nthe revolution that mankind<br />\nneeds: the abolition of war and<br />\nof imperialist relations by<br />\nabolishing both states and the<br />\nnotion of national sovereignty;<br />\n. ..world-wide economic and<br />\neducational equality; birth control on a planetary scale...<br />\nand states that this program \"is<br />\nabsolutely necessary if mankind<br />\nis to survive.\"<br />\nIn his 1977 work The<br />\nTotalitarian Temptation, Revel<br />\nconfirms his strong support for<br />\ndemocratic socialism while opposing all totalitarian systems<br />\nof government. The message<br />\n<br />\nand tone of How Democracies<br />\nPerish is the same. Yet Mr.<br />\nZucker was able to read the entire book (one hopes), all the<br />\nwhile thinking that Revel was a<br />\nconservative!<br />\nZucker's misconception leads<br />\nhim to make the most absurd<br />\nstatements: \"Shockingly, for I<br />\nam a life-long liberal, I happen<br />\nto agree with Mr. Revel's conclusions...\" Shockingly? \"To<br />\nhis credit, Mr. Revel [does not<br />\ncondemn] the International<br />\nSocialist Organzation, or any<br />\nother of the legitimate Socialist<br />\ngroups.\" Why would it even<br />\noccur to Zucker that Revel,<br />\nhimself a socialist, would wish<br />\nto condemn socialism?<br />\nApparently, Mr. Zucker has<br />\nunwittingly accepted the<br />\nMcCarthyist notion that only<br />\nconservatives can beanticommunist; therefore, Mr.<br />\nZucker blunders, he must be a<br />\nconservative.

In<br />\nTyranny of the Status Quo,<br />\neconomists Milton and Rose<br />\nFriedman agree with these aims<br />\nand offer convincing arguments<br />\n<br />\nto support them.<br />\nThe title of the book refers to<br />\nthe vast resistance to change of<br />\nany large government or<br />\nbureaucracy. The main thing<br />\nthat propagates this inertia is<br />\nwhat the authors call the \"Iron<br />\nTriangle\" of special interest<br />\ngroups which preserve the<br />\nstatus quo and the benefits they<br />\nreceive from it. The three sides<br />\nof this triangle are politicians,<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\nbureaucrats,<br />\nbeneficiaries of the laws. The<br />\nstated theme of the book is how<br />\nto disengage from these groups<br />\n<br />\nExcerpt<br />\n\"One set of changes that<br />\ncould yield relatively rapid<br />\nresults is a reduction in the<br />\nacts that are regarded by the<br />\nlaw as crimes. The most promising measure of this kind is<br />\nwith respect to drugs. Most<br />\ncrimes are not committed by<br />\npeople hungry for dope.<br />\nShould we have learned a<br />\nlesson from Prohibition?<br />\nWhen Prohibition was<br />\nenacted in 1920, Billy Sunday,<br />\nthe noted evangelist and<br />\nleading crusader against<br />\nDemon Rum, greeted it as<br />\nfollows:'The reign of tears is<br />\nover. The slums will soon be<br />\nonly a memory. We will turn<br />\nour prisons into factories and<br />\nour jails into storehouses and<br />\n<br />\n\u2022it\u2022Ii\u2022<br />\n<br />\ncorncribs. Men will walk<br />\nupright now, women will<br />\nsmile, and the children will<br />\nlaugh. Hell will be forever for<br />\nrent.' We know now how<br />\ntragically wrong he was. New<br />\nprisons and jails had to be<br />\nbuilt to house the criminals<br />\nspawned by converting the<br />\ndrinking of spirits into a crime<br />\nagainst the state. Prohibition<br />\nundermined respect for the<br />\nlaw, corrupted the minions of<br />\nthe law, and created a decadent moral climate\u2014and in<br />\nthe end did not stop the consumption of alcohol.<br />\nDespite this tragic object<br />\nlesson, we seem bent on<br />\nrepeating precisely the same<br />\nmistake in handling drugs.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nolio<br />\n<br />\nand create a better America.<br />\nHowever, the idea of reducing<br />\ngovernment seems to take<br />\nprecedence in this respect.<br />\nAt first glance, the Friedmans appear to be staunch<br />\nReaganauts. They agree with<br />\nthe President on many issues,<br />\nincluding his very conservative<br />\nstances on taxes and defense.<br />\nAs the book progresses,<br />\nhowever, it becomes evident<br />\nthat they do not concur with all<br />\nof Reagan's views. In either<br />\ncase, their ideas are convincingly presented with background<br />\ninformation and solid arguments.<br />\nThe first section of the book<br />\nconcerns government spending,<br />\ntaxes, and deficits. A brief<br />\nhistory of federal spending is<br />\ngiven, showing how much it has<br />\ngrown in the twentieth century:<br />\nfrom 3 percent of national income in 1902 to about 30 percent today. In addition, the<br />\nauthors are more than happy to<br />\npoint out that the vast majority of this is due to increases in<br />\nsocial programs, not defense.<br />\nOn the subject of the federal<br />\ndeficit, the Friedmans go to<br />\ngreat lengths to downplay its<br />\nimportance. This is in accordance with Ronald Reagan,<br />\nwho obviously puts little emphasis on substantially reducing<br />\nthe growing deficit.

I was impressed by<br />\nthe lack of crime\u2014though you<br />\nhave to lock your bicycle up in<br />\nthis city of twelve million people, a woman can walk on the<br />\nstreets after midnight and not<br />\nbe afraid.

Our<br />\nresponses were more emotional<br />\nand not that analytical or sensitive to the complexities of<br />\nChinese society or the context<br />\nin which tradition, change, progress, etc., operate in China.<br />\nI personally felt that what she<br />\nsaid was true, and after spending two years there I find<br />\nmyself reluctant to talk about<br />\nChina to someone who hasn't<br />\nbeen there. Yes, China has a lot<br />\nof problems, but no, they are<br />\nnot necessarily due to the fact<br />\nthat it is a communist country.<br />\nThe present problems seem to<br />\nstem more from the fact that<br />\nthere is a conflict going on between deep-rooted cultural<br />\ntraditions and the influx of<br />\nWestern values and methods.<br />\nBut there is still a system that,<br />\nif it doesn't operate smoothly<br />\n\"officially,\" does operate very<br />\nefficiently \"unofficially.\"<br />\nFor example, there is an<br />\nendless bureaucratic process for<br />\nalmost every task in China, but<br />\n:f you know someone who has<br />\nzonnections, you can have the<br />\nworld in a day. A Chinese<br />\n<br />\nfriend and I once argued with<br />\na train conductor for more than<br />\nan hour to let us get on a train<br />\nwithout tickets, when he insisted that there was not one<br />\navaiable seat on the train.<br />\nAnother train conductor, of<br />\nhigher rank, happened to come<br />\nalong. Seeing that we were<br />\nfrom his native Shanghai, he<br />\ndecided to help us out. When<br />\nthe train left, we were in a<br />\nsleeping compartment and only paying for seating compartment tickets.<br />\nI found China, with all its<br />\nproblems, very human. I also<br />\ndiscovered that Chinese friends<br />\nare the most reliable friends in<br />\nthe world. After I got over my<br />\ninitial culture shock, I<br />\ndiscovered that I couldn't feel<br />\nalienated in this culture, that I<br />\nhad become intoxicated with<br />\nthis old empire of Asia decked<br />\nout in half-modern garb, and<br />\nthat I was being invited to be a<br />\npart of it. I recommend China<br />\nto anyone who is open-minded<br />\nand hardy, because it is sure to<br />\ntry your physical, as well as<br />\nemotional well-being for the<br />\nfirst few months you are<br />\nthere\u2014especially if you are<br />\nAmerican. I had a great time,<br />\nand am glad I didn't go to<br />\nFrance.<br />\n<br />\nby Brad Asher<br />\n<br />\nWhen I told the Features<br />\nEditor, eight months ago, that<br />\nI was going to Brazil, she suggested I write an article for the<br />\nNews-Letter. She even recommended that I do two articles,<br />\none being the average \"student<br />\nabroad\" story, the other being<br />\n\"something really Brazilian.\"<br />\nNot knowing quite what that<br />\nsomething would be, I set out<br />\nto do the former, but, when it<br />\nwas finished, it did not do<br />\njustice to the experience I have<br />\nhad, and am having, down<br />\nhere.

When I<br />\nread them, I knew somehow<br />\nthat that just wasn't it, for two<br />\nreasons. The first and most obvious being that, in an article<br />\nfor the News-Letter, you cannot really enter into those complex social issues, about which<br />\nI know extremely little, and give<br />\nany kind of complete notion of<br />\nthem. The other reason why it<br />\nhas taken me eight months to<br />\nwrite this article is that my head<br />\nhas been sent spinning by<br />\neverything I have encountered<br />\nhere. Not just due to those<br />\nsocial aspects, the richness and<br />\nvariety of it all, that I had tried<br />\nto relate in those first articles,<br />\nbut due to something else that<br />\nis impossible to describe on<br />\npaper\u2014confusion, the incredible mixture of everything. If<br />\nregional differences exist, say,<br />\nbetween the highly industrialized area of Sao Paulo and the<br />\npredominantly agricultural Nor'theast region; one faced with a<br />\nseries of modern urban problems, the other dominated by<br />\nan almost-feudalistic social<br />\nstructure where great land-0<br />\nowners carry out private wars<br />\nagainst each other. There is also<br />\na lot of the Northeast present in<br />\nSao Paulo\u2014not only because<br />\nof the amount of migrants who<br />\nflock to the city in search of<br />\nwork, but also in other terms,<br />\nthose of attitudes and behavior,<br />\neven among people born and<br />\nraised in Sao Paulo. And there<br />\nis a good deal of Sao Paulo in<br />\nthe Northeast. It is easy to find<br />\npeople who by day will plow<br />\ntheir small plots of land either<br />\nby hand or with a mule-drawn<br />\nplowshare and, at night, go<br />\nhome to a mud hut with a dirt<br />\nfloor, switch on the television,<br />\nand watch a soap-opera that<br />\ndeals with video-games, robots,<br />\nand computers. And it's not<br />\neven a matter of dividing<br />\n<br />\nday between the \"primitive<br />\npart\" and the \"modern part,\"<br />\nit's that these people literally<br />\nlive in two worlds (or more) at<br />\nthe same time. The parts are<br />\ndistinguishable, but they are so<br />\nintertwined that it is impossible<br />\nto categorize. That shakes an<br />\nAmerican up, because we are so<br />\nused to rationality and<br />\norganization, with a place for<br />\neverything and everything in its<br />\n<br />\nlace.<br />\nOther examples can be found<br />\nin those same social questions<br />\nraised earlier. Racism, for example, does and does not exist<br />\nhere, and on different levels. It<br />\nis much more common, and<br />\nless frowned-upon than in the<br />\nStates, to see racially-mixed<br />\ncouples. There is a widely-held<br />\nconcept<br />\nof<br />\n\"racial<br />\ndemocracy\"; that is, that there<br />\n<br />\nis no discrimination on the basis the heaviest African influence,<br />\nof race in Ftra7iI.

The school<br />\nis located downtown in the<br />\nHenry Phipps Building, adjacent to the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical Hospital. Three<br />\nBaltimore-based hospitals\u2014<br />\nSinai, Church, and Johns<br />\n<br />\nNursing students working in<br />\n<br />\nHopkins\u2014are affiliated with<br />\nthe Hopkins University and<br />\nform an integral part of the<br />\nnursing program.<br />\nIn an interview, four students<br />\nin this first class, Bernie<br />\nKeenan, Marijoy Figueroa,<br />\nCecil Taylor, and Annie<br />\nStruntz, described the program.<br />\nIt is unique in the sense that the<br />\n<br />\nstudents not only lOrn current<br />\nclinical techniques,\"but are also<br />\ntaught the theories behind the<br />\nvarious practices and are taught<br />\nhow to apply their knowledge<br />\nto new situations which they<br />\nmay encounter. Attention is<br />\ngiven to the \"why to\" questions<br />\nas well as the \"how to\" questions. The trend today is<br />\ntoward higher education of<br />\nnurses, but the Hopkins pro-<br />\n<br />\nquisite, students entering the<br />\nprogram must have already<br />\ncompleted two years of<br />\nundergraduate education and<br />\ntaken courses in chemistry,<br />\nanatomy and physiology,<br />\nmicrobiology, as well as courses<br />\nin the humanities and social<br />\nsciences. The Hopkins nursing<br />\ncurriculum is divided into three<br />\nparts\u2014clinical work, practice<br />\nlaboratories, and lectures.<br />\nThe clinical work begins during the first week of the program. Students spend two days<br />\nper week at a hospital and<br />\nrotate approximately every<br />\nseven weeks to a new division.<br />\nThe divisions include geriatrics,<br />\npediatrics, obstetrics, medical<br />\nsurgery, psychology, and public<br />\nhealth. The students are supervised but have responsibilities<br />\nand duties similar to those of<br />\nthe licensed nurses (e.g. administering medication, taking<br />\ncase histories, charting patient<br />\ninformation, and providing patient education and comfort.)<br />\nStruntz, secretary of the<br />\nclass, explained that the human<br />\nelement and the patient's dignity are very important in nursing.

Only in the past decade,<br />\nhowever, has the binge-purge<br />\nsyndrome called bulimia been<br />\nrecognized as a disorder<br />\nseparate from anorexia.<br />\nDerived from the Greek<br />\nwords meaning \"ox\" and<br />\n\"hunger,\" bulimia was first<br />\ndescribed by Dr. Gerald Russell<br />\nin England. He listed two main<br />\ncriteria for diagnosis. First, the<br />\npatient feels an irresistable urge<br />\nto overeat, which is followed by<br />\nself-induced vomiting or purging. Second, these patients have<br />\nan extreme fear of fatness. According to Dr. Arnold Andersen, M.D., Assistant Professor<br />\nof Psychiatry and Behavioral<br />\nSciences at The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity School of Medicine,<br />\nboth anorexia and bulimia<br />\nbelong to a spectrum of eating<br />\ndisorders. Features commoa to<br />\nboth syndromes are a fear of<br />\nfatness, pursuit of thinness, and<br />\nfeelings of ineffectiveness,<br />\nespecially in stressful situations.<br />\nThe difference, however, is that<br />\nwhile the anorectic is able to<br />\nrestrict intake of food to the<br />\npoint of emaciation, the<br />\nbulimic's extreme urge to eat<br />\n\"breaks through\" that restric-<br />\n<br />\ntion, leading to extreme<br />\novereating. Because of the fear<br />\nof fatness, however, a sense of<br />\npanic occurs after the binge. A<br />\n\"second defense\" then follows,<br />\nin which the patient purges the<br />\nfood, either by vomiting or laxatives in order to prevent weight<br />\ngain. Sometimes a period of<br />\nstarvation or heavy exercise will<br />\nfollow binging, but these activities characterize anorexia<br />\nmore than bulimia. Another<br />\nmajor difference is that while<br />\n<br />\nhospitals. According to Dr. S.<br />\nAppling, a full-time professor<br />\nin the nursing program, working in the three hospitals is advantageous, since the students<br />\nare exposed to varied medical<br />\natmospheres and situations.<br />\nChurch is a small community<br />\nhospital. Sinai is a larger community hospital with a wellrehabilitation<br />\nrecognized<br />\ncenter, and the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital specializes in high risk<br />\ncases.<br />\nBesides clinical work, the<br />\nstudents also attend classes<br />\ndealing with such topics as<br />\nanatomy, psychology, sociology, human development,<br />\npharmacology, and pathophysiology. Classes are also given in<br />\nconjunction with and related to<br />\nthe students' clinical work.

His<br />\nappointment comes at a time of<br />\nexpansion and diversification<br />\nof the department. In a recent<br />\ninterview, Krolik discussed his<br />\nbackground and his work at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nKrolik is an astrophysicist.<br />\nMost of his time these days is<br />\nspent studying what are known<br />\nas active galactic nuclei; this has<br />\nbeen an interest of his since he<br />\ncompleted his thesis. At the<br />\ncenter of active galaxies, there<br />\nare very bright points of light,<br />\nthe total power of which can be<br />\n100 or 1000 times greater than<br />\nthe power from all the stars in<br />\nthe galaxy. These galaxies are<br />\nnot particularly larger or<br />\nsmaller than non-active ones<br />\nsuch as ours, nor are these<br />\ngalaxies tremendously different<br />\nfrom ordinary galaxies in their<br />\nother properties, so scientists<br />\ndo not really know what causes<br />\nthe bright center.<br />\nBy studying the spectra of the<br />\nlight received from these galaxies, it is known that whatever is<br />\nat the center, it is not made of<br />\nstars. Furthermore, scientists<br />\nare able to estimate the size of<br />\nthe power source. From relativity, it is known that light always<br />\ntravels at a constant speed and<br />\nnothing else can travel faster.<br />\nBy knowing the speed of light<br />\nand observing fluctuations in<br />\nthe brightness of nuclei, scien-<br />\n<br />\ntists can find the upper limit of<br />\nthe size of the nuclei. Because<br />\na fluctuatuion can only travel<br />\nacross the nucleus at a certain<br />\nrate, scientists can observe how<br />\nlong it takes to do so and can<br />\ncalculate the diameter of the<br />\nnucleus.<br />\nThe most violently fluctuating galactic nuclei have<br />\n<br />\nproject studying the wind of<br />\nstars. Our sun has a rather<br />\nsmall wind compared to that of<br />\nsome stars. Wind from a star is<br />\ncomposed of the same elements<br />\nthat form the star.

It will<br />\nalso tell scientists about the early lives of galaxies.<br />\nKrolik's career has been impressive. He attended MIT as<br />\nan undergraduate. From there,<br />\nhe went to the University of<br />\nCalifornia at Berkely for his<br />\nPh.D. Krolik did post-doctoral<br />\nwork at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.<br />\nThen he did more post-doctoral<br />\nwork back at MIT. After that<br />\nhe became a research associate<br />\nat Harvard. Finally, in 1984 he<br />\ncame to Hopkins as an assistant<br />\nprofessor at age 35.

Hospitals are<br />\nbeginning to switch from paper<br />\nfiling systems to computerized<br />\nones, and nurses will be integral<br />\nin instilling the new systems.<br />\nThe Hopkins faculty em-<br />\n<br />\nphasizes not only the usage of<br />\ncomputers but also the ability<br />\nto recognize what is desirable<br />\nand necessary in a hospital<br />\nsystem.<br />\nThe students also have ready<br />\naccess to the Welch Medical<br />\nLibrary.

In July of<br />\n1986, the first Hopkins nursing<br />\n<br />\nclass will take the Maryland<br />\nstate board exam, and if they<br />\npass, shall receive licenses as<br />\nregistered nurses.<br />\nThe current Hopkins nursing<br />\nclass is small but is expected to<br />\nincrease in future years to about<br />\nseventy-five students. The nursing program intends to expand<br />\nto include a graduate program<br />\nleading to a Master of Science<br />\ndegree in nursing. Student input<br />\nis welcomed by the faculty and<br />\nthe program as a whole is flexible. According to Keenan, the<br />\nstudent president of this nursing class, the program is running smoothly.

While both tend<br />\nto be self-critical and perfectionistic, bulimics seem to be<br />\nmuch more sensitive to inner<br />\ndistress and less able to resist<br />\n<br />\nurges. They are consequently<br />\nmore prone to act on impulse.<br />\nA small subgroup of bulimics<br />\nhave other disorders of impulse<br />\ncontrol, including drug and<br />\nalcohol abuse, promiscuity,<br />\nstealing, and suicidal tendencies. These characteristics are<br />\nnot found in anorectic patients.<br />\nBulimic patients are more<br />\noutgoing than anorectics, and<br />\nare more likely to engage in sexual activity. The typical anorectic, on the other hand, is a<br />\n\"model child,\" who often has<br />\nless personality development at<br />\nthe outset of the personality<br />\ndisorder, and becomes more<br />\nimmature and less able to relate<br />\nto others as starvation continues. Although the majority<br />\nof anorectics are women, it is<br />\nestimated that men comprise<br />\nfive to ten percent of all persons<br />\nwith eating disorders.<br />\nResearch has shown that patients with eating disorders are<br />\nmuch more likely to have family members with affective<br />\n<br />\ndisorders, which include mood<br />\ndisorders, alcoholism, and<br />\nobsessive-compulsive disorders.<br />\nMany patients with eating<br />\ndisorders develop affective<br />\ndisorders later in life.

The idea<br />\nis not to take away the anorexia or bulimia, but to make it unnecessary. Feeding into this are<br />\nother psychodynamic issues,<br />\nsuch as certain themes in the<br />\npatient's life, underlying selfimages, and relationships with<br />\nfamily members. Finally, after<br />\na long period of therapy, a<br />\ntransference develops in which<br />\nthe patient begins to act<br />\ntowards the therapist as he or<br />\nshe would toward other significant people in his or her life. By<br />\nunderstanding and making<br />\nchanges in these relationships,<br />\nthere's a change in fundamental orientation towards life,<br />\nwith a sense of more control,<br />\neffectiveness, and self-esteem,<br />\nand less fear of maturity.

Andersen is also particularly involved in studying<br />\nthe male with eating disorders.<br />\nAlthough a minority, there is<br />\nsufficient number to warrant<br />\nattention.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Russell, the<br />\nprognosis for bulimics is not as<br />\nfavorable as for anorectics, due<br />\nto their Increased physical complications, more resistance to<br />\ntreatment, and a higher risk of<br />\nsuicide.

When she phoned<br />\ntourney officials the night<br />\nshe<br />\ndeparture,<br />\nbefore<br />\nyet<br />\nnot<br />\nhad<br />\nthey<br />\ndiscovered that<br />\nreceived her entry, and, furthermore, that they had no room<br />\nfor her in the draw. Unruffled,<br />\nshe went anyway, and was<br />\ngiven a spot in the contest. She<br />\nmanaged to fight her way to the<br />\nfinal round, upsetting the first<br />\nseed on her way and bowing<br />\nonly in the finals to a University of Virginia graduate in four<br />\ngames. As a result of this accomplishment, she is now considered to be an A player, the<br />\nhighest level a player can attain<br />\nin this country, but she'll beat<br />\nyou up if you make any Mr. T<br />\njokes to her face.<br />\nChai had more company this<br />\npast weekend as Lisa Roy also<br />\nplayed in intercollegiates, held<br />\nin Williamstown, MA, at<br />\nWilliams College. Unfortunately for both, however, they drew<br />\nto face the No. 2 and No. 1<br />\nplayers, respectively, from<br />\nTrinity College, a Division I<br />\nschool.<br />\nIn a Friday morning match,<br />\nChai faced a somewhat<br />\nunsteady No. 6 seed, Kathy<br />\nCastle. However, Chai herself<br />\nwas obviously nervous, and,<br />\ngoing for winners, missed a lot<br />\nof tricky corner shots, and lost<br />\nthe first game at 4.<br />\nIn the second game, Chai<br />\nfought harder and gained<br />\neleven points en route to losing.<br />\nCool-headed and confident<br />\nfrom this score as well as settling into her own game, Chai<br />\nwon the next game 15-9. True,<br />\nCastle missed some easy shots,<br />\nbut Chai had her share of<br />\noutright winners, some of them<br />\nso well placed that her<br />\ndisconcerted opponent complemented \"Good shot\" in a<br />\nsubdued tone. Of the unseeded<br />\nplayers, Chai was definitely one<br />\nof the most formidable to run<br />\nacross in the first round, and<br />\nshe certainly surprised her opponent with her ability.<br />\nIt was too bad it did not last.<br />\nBoth players were nervous in<br />\nthe fourth game\u2014Chai because<br />\nshe realized the possibility of<br />\ncausing an upset, and Castle<br />\nbecause she felt the pressure of<br />\n<br />\nthe forehand side. Oddly, Irwin<br />\nran forward for the ball, which<br />\nwas already driven past both<br />\nplayers to the back court, and<br />\nran into Chai's racquet. The<br />\nlenses popped out of her<br />\nglasses' frames, and she appeared injured.

Individually, Andy Goldberg kept his title as MAC Foil Champion,<br />\nwhile Wales Shao and Chris<br />\nCalingaert took second and<br />\nfourth place titles respectively<br />\nin sabre and Tim Cook placed<br />\nfifth in epee.<br />\nThe MAC Tournament fielded ten teams this year, the<br />\nlargest in recent years. The addition of Army as well as other<br />\nschools made this year's MAC<br />\nmuch more competitive. Each<br />\nteam in the tournament was<br />\ncomposed of six fencers, two in<br />\neach weapon. The team winning the most bouts of all three<br />\nweapons combined was the<br />\nTeam<br />\nMAC 3-Weapon<br />\nChampion.<br />\nThe first match of the<br />\nMAC's saw Hopkins go against<br />\nTemple. The Jays, not forgetting their only defeat this year<br />\nto the Owls, trounced them by<br />\nwinning four of the six bouts.<br />\n\"Foiled again\" is what the<br />\nopposing teams must have been<br />\nthinking as the Hopkins foil<br />\nteam, for the second year in a<br />\nrow, captured the MAC Foil<br />\nTeam Champion title. Temple's<br />\nfoil team thought it had captured the title because it was<br />\nthree wins ahead when it finished its foil bouts. But the game<br />\nwas not over, because the Jays<br />\n<br />\nstill had three bouts left to<br />\nfence.<br />\nWith Goldberg having<br />\nalready finished his bouts with<br />\nan 8-1 record, the pressure was<br />\non foil captain Toby Chai to<br />\nwin all three of his remaining<br />\nbouts. After winning two easy<br />\nones, Chai faced a tough<br />\nHaverford opponent. The bout<br />\nwas close, but Chai won in the<br />\nclosing seconds to go 7-2 for the<br />\nday.<br />\nThis win not only put the<br />\nHopkins foil team in first place,<br />\nbut also proved to be Hopkins'<br />\nlast victory which gave them the<br />\nMAC Three-Weapon Team<br />\nChampion title.<br />\nGoldberg continued to prove<br />\nhis fencing prowess as he remains the MAC Foil Champion. After going 8-1 in the foil<br />\nround, he went<br />\nteam<br />\nundefeated in the finals to keep<br />\nhis crown. The junior finished<br />\nthis year with an impressive<br />\n58-5 record. He has a sure shot<br />\nat qualifying to the NCAA<br />\nTournament to be held later<br />\nthis year at Notre Dame<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe sabre lineup, which was<br />\nunknown until a few moments<br />\nbefore the MAC's, starred<br />\nWales Shao and Chris Calingaert. Calingaert finished the<br />\nsabre team round with a record<br />\nof 7-2, while Shao finished 8-1<br />\nin his pool. Shao's last win proved to be the decisive one for<br />\nthe Hopkins sabre team as they<br />\ncaptured the Team Champion<br />\ntitle. Both qualified for the<br />\nsabre individual finals.<br />\nUnbelievably, there was a<br />\n4-way tie for first place in the<br />\nfinals, with Calingaert and<br />\nShao being two of the four<br />\nfencers in that tie. Fencing rules<br />\nsay that there must be a fenceoff between the four fencers<br />\n(round robin of four) to deter-<br />\n<br />\nmine a winner. After the smoke<br />\ncleared, Shao was second, while<br />\nCalingaert finished fourth.<br />\nIn the first match of the tournament against Temple, the<br />\nHopkins epee team of Tim<br />\nCook and Russ Carstens, provided two of the four victories<br />\nfor the Blue Jays. Although this<br />\nyear's epee team was considered to have the best shot out<br />\nof the three weapons at clinching a team championship,<br />\nthey wound up in a tight race<br />\nwith Army and Temple.<br />\nAfter the epee team bouts<br />\nwere over, Hopkins was only<br />\ntwo wins away from having its<br />\nthird weapon team champion<br />\ntitle. Cook finished 7-2 in the<br />\nteam round and went on to take<br />\nfifth place individually.<br />\nCarstens, who had a tough day,<br />\nfinished 5-4 in the team round,<br />\nalthough three of Carstens'<br />\n<br />\nwins were against tougher<br />\nopponents.<br />\nThe Hopkins men's fencing<br />\nteam was strongly tested<br />\nthroughout this year, but the<br />\nJay swordsmen have stuck<br />\ntogether and come through<br />\nwith victory after victory. It has<br />\nbeen nine years since the Blue<br />\nJays have held the MAC<br />\n3-Weapon Team Champion title for two or more consecutive<br />\nyears.<br />\nCoach Dick Oles was awarded for his superior coaching this<br />\nyear, as his fellow MAC<br />\ncoaches voted him as Coach of<br />\nthe Year. According to Oles, no<br />\none on the team fenced over his<br />\nhead and everyone fenced to his<br />\nexpected capabilities.

A new dean, they say, will help to<br />\n\"streamline\" affairs into the separate areas<br />\nof academics and non-academics. Supposedly, such changes in the system will allow<br />\nHomewood to run more smoothly and<br />\nefficiently.<br />\nA potentially negative response may result<br />\nfrom such a move. Undergraduates especially are likely to assume that this is merely<br />\nanother addition to the already confusing<br />\ntangle of bureaucracy and red tape that exists here. Another administrator may simply mean one more person to contribute to<br />\n. the sometimes perplexing policies issued<br />\nfrom the hallowed halls of Garland and<br />\nMerryman.<br />\nHowever, it might be wise to put aside our<br />\ncynicism for a moment. The new dean, who<br />\nwill hold a rank equivalent to that of Arts<br />\nand Sciences Dean Fisher and Engineering<br />\nDean Vandelinde, will have his primary<br />\nresponsibilities centered about non-academic<br />\naffairs. This will include such diverse concerns as student amenities, auxiliary enter-<br /><br />\nprises, the Office of the Registrar and<br />\nhousing.<br />\nObviously, students have a vested interest<br />\nin these areas and would benefit from any<br />\nimprovement in their organizational structure. The current situation demands that all<br />\nquestions concerning non-academic affairs<br />\nbe channeled through several offices, including those of Fisher and Vandelinde, who<br />\nmust then consult with one another before<br />\nreaching a decision. The process is timeconsuming and, at times, irritating to<br />\nwitness.<br />\nA single dean, however, whose principal<br />\nfocus is on auxiliary services would offer a<br />\nsignificant advantage. Non-academic activities would be addressed at the same level<br />\nas that of academic concerns. In addition,<br />\nwe would lose nothing to this development.<br />\nAcademics and non-academics alike would<br />\nreceive added attention. The administrative<br />\nhierarchy, a necessary evil, could be<br />\nimproved.<br />\nStudents should support these changes.<br />\nOur opinions and suggestions about the position should be solicited and given. There is<br />\na great deal to be gained from this decision.<br /><br />\nTime to Relax<br />\nSchool spirit has never been a big deal at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, especially in recent years.<br />\nWhile other colleges and universities have<br />\npep rallies, class days, spirit contests and,<br />\nyes, even a social life, Hopkins has ARA,<br />\npre-meds and the Milton Hilton. It's not that<br />\nwe don't pay attention. Rarely a day goes<br />\nby that complaints cannot be overheard concerning the social wasteland that is<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nIt would seem logical that any opportunity<br />\nto alleviate such misery would be pursued<br />\nwith great enthusiasm. A lacrosse game, say,<br />\nmight relieve those mid-semester blues and<br />\ngive one the chance to relax, enjoy the<br />\nweather and actually see fellow undergraduates without their Organic Chemistry<br />\ntexts in tow.<br /><br />\nIt is unlikely, however, that the Hut and<br />\nthe MSEL will be completely empty tomorrow afternoon. We fully expect that a good<br />\npercentage of our highly intelligent and grade<br />\nconscious student population will waste<br />\nprime weekend hours on D-Level.<br />\nThis is unfortunate. Contrary to popular<br />\nbelief, four years at JHU need not add up<br />\nto a wasted youth. There are certainly times<br />\nthat can be enjoyed if one has the inclination. Or the courage.<br />\nTake a chance. Pack a cooler with your<br />\nfavorite beverage and munchies and go see<br />\nthe game against Syracuse tomorrow.

The Rotunda<br />\nShuttle, the Airport Shuttle and<br />\nthe Security phone proposal<br />\nwere all worked on by the entire committee as well as myself<br />\nand my co-chairman, James<br />\nHerring. I did not mean to imply that these services were the<br />\nresult of my work alone.<br />\nAs co-chairman, I take a<br />\ngreat personal pride in<br /><br />\nachievements of the Student<br />\nServices Committee this year<br />\nand I am proud of the work of<br />\nevery member of the committee. What we have accomplished would not have been possible without the cooperation and<br />\ndedication of all involved. I<br />\nhope my co-chairman and the<br />\nmembers of our committee feel<br />\nthe same pride in our work.<br />\nAlison Little<br />\nCo-Chairman, Student Council<br />\nStudent Services Committee<br /><br />\nAnti-Bird Talk<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nI am humbled before the<br /><br />\nwisdom of the News-Letter's<br />\nnews editors. Last Friday, I expected to see an article on the<br />\nprogress of the anti-apartheid<br />\nmovement at JHU. I found instead more pressing news had<br />\nbeen chosen for print, exemplified by the announcement<br />\nof the birth of several rare<br />\nbirds. There are several events<br />\nthat I had foolishly expected to<br />\nbe mentioned instead. For example, since the News-Letter<br />\ncovered the first protest a<br />\nmonth ago, 23 more Hopkins<br />\nstudents have been arrested for<br />\nprotesting against apartheid<br />\nand against Johns Hopkins' investments in companies which<br />\noperate in South Africa (bring-<br /><br />\ning the total number of JHU<br />\narrests to 32). Over 70 JHU<br />\nstudents have picketed for the<br />\ncause, and over twenty percent<br />\nof the student body has signed<br />\na petition asking Johns<br />\nHopkins to divest. Faculty<br />\nmembers have signed as well<br />\nand will be getting arrested with<br />\nus in the near future. The<br />\nHopkins Anti-Apartheid Coalition(HAAC)has been formed,<br />\nand under it there has been an<br />\nalmost unprecedented cooperation between a large number of<br />\nstudent organizations (18 have<br />\nsigned the petition, 5 are supplying large amounts of funding and personnel). The protest is undeniably the biggest in<br />\nthe recent history of JHU. The<br />\nFebruary 22 protest (when 16<br />\nJHU students were arrested)<br />\nwas covered by the 6 o'clock<br />\nnews, several radio stations (including an interview with<br />\nHAAC officer Gillian Clark),<br />\nand the Washington Post(Feb.<br />\n23), but not, to my surprise, by<br />\nthe News-Letter. So last Friday,<br />\nI looked through the NewsLetter to see which articles the<br />\ntwo news editors thought were<br />\nmore important. One particular<br />\narticle on rare bird births<br />\ncaught my attention. I realized<br />\nhow insignificant the above<br />\ndescribed protest events were in<br />\ncomparison. I was humbled. I<br />\nam sending each of the petition<br />\nsigners, demonstrators, and arrestees a photocopy of the<br />\nGreat Tinamou featured on<br />\npage 22 of the last issue so that<br />\nthey know what is important in<br />\nthis world. I have also fired off<br />\nan angry letter to the<br />\nWashington Post, chiding them<br />\nfor writing about Johns<br />\nHopkins students when they<br />\nshould be writing about the<br />\nsilver-beaked taneger so<br />\nthoughtfully covered by the<br />\nNews-Letter in Friday's issue. I<br />\npity the Post for missing such<br />\nimportant news and thus being<br />\noutclassed in article selection by<br />\nthe News-Letter news editors<br />\nwho knew where the real news<br />\nwas to be found, the National<br />\nAquarium.<br />\nHumbly,<br />\nJim Keim<br />\nHAAC Protest Coordinator<br /><br />\nPoetry Comment<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhile I am pleased that the<br />\nNews-Letter reviewed the latest<br />\ncollection of Stephen Crane's<br />\nprose and poetry, I was disappointed by Mr. White's faulty<br />\nanalysis of Crane's poetic intent<br />\nand ideological persuasion. Mr.<br />\nWhite writes, \"... The Black<br />\nRiders and Other Lines is a<br />\nsearing attack on traditional<br />\nreligious values.\" Crane's<br />\npoems about the \"puffing<br />\nbraggart\" God do indeed condemn the stereotypical fundamentalist god, the god of<br />\nthose who will -rest assured<br />\nthat God is at this very moment<br />\ngleefully<br />\nroasting<br />\nMr.<br />\nCrane...\" However, this is not<br />\nan attack on traditional<br />\nreligious values; Crane's ideal<br />\nman was the Christian<br />\ngentleman.<br />\nMr. White's statement that<br />\nCrane believes \"courage has little to do with carrying a gun\"<br />\nis also misleading. Certainly<br />\nCrane's conception of courage<br />\nwas not limited to the carrying<br />\nof a gun, nor does he believe<br />\nthat all those who carry guns<br />\nare courageous, but he did<br />\nvalue courage in battle. In fact,<br />\none of the major themes in his<br />\nwritings is that of \"life as<br />\nbattle.\"<br />\nCrane wrote a number of<br />\nstories which deal explicitly<br />\nwith war, the most famous of<br />\nwhich The Red Badge of<br />\nCourage, was included in the<br />\nanthology Mr. White reviewed.<br />\nPerhaps the remembered<br />\nboredom of his high school<br />\nEnglish class caused Mr. White<br />\nto neglect to re-read this novel<br />\ncarefully: if he had, he might<br />\nhave drawn a different conclusion about Crane' attitude<br />\ntoward war. So that my objections are not dismissed as merely differences in literary interpretation, let me support my<br />\nclaims with some biographical information. During the Spanish-American war,<br />\nCrane was a war correspondent<br />\nin Cuba.

Having followed<br />\nRevel's work for some time, I<br />\nwas surprised to see that the<br />\nreview ran under the headings<br />\n\"Democracy's Shortfalls: A<br />\nConservative's View\" and<br />\n\"Revel's Conservatism.\" Mr.<br />\nZucker, in spite of having supposedly read Revel's work,<br />\nseems to be completely unaware<br />\nthat Jean-Francois revel is, and<br />\nhas long been, a well-known<br />\nFrench socialist.<br />\nIn his 1970 work Without<br />\nMarx or Jesus, Revel writes<br />\nthat\" .the American Left is<br />\nprobably the world's only hope<br />\nfor a revolution that will save<br />\nit from destruction.\" He also<br />\nsets forth his\"... program for<br />\nthe revolution that mankind<br />\nneeds: the abolition of war and<br />\nof imperialist relations by<br />\nabolishing both states and the<br />\nnotion of national sovereignty;<br />\n. ..world-wide economic and<br />\neducational equality; birth control on a planetary scale...<br />\nand states that this program \"is<br />\nabsolutely necessary if mankind<br />\nis to survive.\"<br />\nIn his 1977 work The<br />\nTotalitarian Temptation, Revel<br />\nconfirms his strong support for<br />\ndemocratic socialism while opposing all totalitarian systems<br />\nof government. The message<br /><br />\nand tone of How Democracies<br />\nPerish is the same. Yet Mr.<br />\nZucker was able to read the entire book (one hopes), all the<br />\nwhile thinking that Revel was a<br />\nconservative!<br />\nZucker's misconception leads<br />\nhim to make the most absurd<br />\nstatements: \"Shockingly, for I<br />\nam a life-long liberal, I happen<br />\nto agree with Mr. Revel's conclusions...\" Shockingly? \"To<br />\nhis credit, Mr. Revel [does not<br />\ncondemn] the International<br />\nSocialist Organzation, or any<br />\nother of the legitimate Socialist<br />\ngroups.\" Why would it even<br />\noccur to Zucker that Revel,<br />\nhimself a socialist, would wish<br />\nto condemn socialism?<br />\nApparently, Mr. Zucker has<br />\nunwittingly accepted the<br />\nMcCarthyist notion that only<br />\nconservatives can beanticommunist; therefore, Mr.<br />\nZucker blunders, he must be a<br />\nconservative.

In<br />\nTyranny of the Status Quo,<br />\neconomists Milton and Rose<br />\nFriedman agree with these aims<br />\nand offer convincing arguments<br /><br />\nto support them.<br />\nThe title of the book refers to<br />\nthe vast resistance to change of<br />\nany large government or<br />\nbureaucracy. The main thing<br />\nthat propagates this inertia is<br />\nwhat the authors call the \"Iron<br />\nTriangle\" of special interest<br />\ngroups which preserve the<br />\nstatus quo and the benefits they<br />\nreceive from it.

In either<br />\ncase, their ideas are convincingly presented with background<br />\ninformation and solid arguments.<br />\nThe first section of the book<br />\nconcerns government spending,<br />\ntaxes, and deficits.

In addition, the<br />\nauthors are more than happy to<br />\npoint out that the vast majority of this is due to increases in<br />\nsocial programs, not defense.<br />\nOn the subject of the federal<br />\ndeficit, the Friedmans go to<br />\ngreat lengths to downplay its<br />\nimportance. This is in accordance with Ronald Reagan,<br />\nwho obviously puts little emphasis on substantially reducing<br />\nthe growing deficit.

I was impressed by<br />\nthe lack of crime\u2014though you<br />\nhave to lock your bicycle up in<br />\nthis city of twelve million people, a woman can walk on the<br />\nstreets after midnight and not<br />\nbe afraid. I was also impressed<br />\nwith the enthusiasm and<br />\nidealism of all the students I<br />\nmet. I felt like I was forgetting<br />\nwhat America was like and was<br />\nenjoying every minute of it.<br />\nA Chinese woman said to a<br />\ngroup of foreign students (there<br />\nwere 126 in all at my university: 26 Americans, 30 Japanese,<br />\nand 70 Europeans)shortly after<br />\nwe had arrived that those people that stay in China a month<br />\ngo home and write a book;<br />\nthose that stay six months go<br />\nhome and write articles; and<br />\nContinued on next page<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br /><br />\nHave a Taste of England, China, and Brazil<br />\nBrazil<br />\nContinued from last page<br />\nthose nat stay more than a year<br />\nnever seem to write anything.<br />\nThough she was perhaps exaggerating, it was clear she knew<br />\nour initial reactions to Chinese<br />\nlife were naive and culturally<br />\nbiased, as was inevitable in light<br />\nof the drastic cultural differences we encountered. Our<br />\nresponses were more emotional<br />\nand not that analytical or sensitive to the complexities of<br />\nChinese society or the context<br />\nin which tradition, change, progress, etc., operate in China.<br />\nI personally felt that what she<br />\nsaid was true, and after spending two years there I find<br />\nmyself reluctant to talk about<br />\nChina to someone who hasn't<br />\nbeen there. Yes, China has a lot<br />\nof problems, but no, they are<br />\nnot necessarily due to the fact<br />\nthat it is a communist country.<br />\nThe present problems seem to<br />\nstem more from the fact that<br />\nthere is a conflict going on between deep-rooted cultural<br />\ntraditions and the influx of<br />\nWestern values and methods.<br />\nBut there is still a system that,<br />\nif it doesn't operate smoothly<br />\n\"officially,\" does operate very<br />\nefficiently \"unofficially.\"<br />\nFor example, there is an<br />\nendless bureaucratic process for<br />\nalmost every task in China, but<br />\n:f you know someone who has<br />\nzonnections, you can have the<br />\nworld in a day. A Chinese<br /><br />\nfriend and I once argued with<br />\na train conductor for more than<br />\nan hour to let us get on a train<br />\nwithout tickets, when he insisted that there was not one<br />\navaiable seat on the train.<br />\nAnother train conductor, of<br />\nhigher rank, happened to come<br />\nalong. Seeing that we were<br />\nfrom his native Shanghai, he<br />\ndecided to help us out. When<br />\nthe train left, we were in a<br />\nsleeping compartment and only paying for seating compartment tickets.<br />\nI found China, with all its<br />\nproblems, very human. I also<br />\ndiscovered that Chinese friends<br />\nare the most reliable friends in<br />\nthe world. After I got over my<br />\ninitial culture shock, I<br />\ndiscovered that I couldn't feel<br />\nalienated in this culture, that I<br />\nhad become intoxicated with<br />\nthis old empire of Asia decked<br />\nout in half-modern garb, and<br />\nthat I was being invited to be a<br />\npart of it. I recommend China<br />\nto anyone who is open-minded<br />\nand hardy, because it is sure to<br />\ntry your physical, as well as<br />\nemotional well-being for the<br />\nfirst few months you are<br />\nthere\u2014especially if you are<br />\nAmerican. I had a great time,<br />\nand am glad I didn't go to<br />\nFrance.<br /><br />\nby Brad Asher<br /><br />\nWhen I told the Features<br />\nEditor, eight months ago, that<br />\nI was going to Brazil, she suggested I write an article for the<br />\nNews-Letter. She even recommended that I do two articles,<br />\none being the average \"student<br />\nabroad\" story, the other being<br />\n\"something really Brazilian.\"<br />\nNot knowing quite what that<br />\nsomething would be, I set out<br />\nto do the former, but, when it<br />\nwas finished, it did not do<br />\njustice to the experience I have<br />\nhad, and am having, down<br />\nhere. There is much more to it<br />\nthan the stories about my arrival in Sao Paulo, a city of<br />\nmore than eleven million people, and my consequent amazement at the noise, the traffic,<br />\nthe pollution, and the big cityness of it all. The fear of going<br />\ninto a store because I did not<br />\nspeak Portugese, as well as my<br />\nvarious experiences in the<br />\nUniversity\u2014the anti-Americanism, the Marxism, my adaptations to a system where participation is more important<br />\nthan lectures\u2014all were part of<br />\nConnie Rosemont planned for that \"student abroad\" article,<br />\na year in China, and ultimately the one that I threw away after<br />\nstayed for two.<br />\nwriting.<br /><br />\nAs a result, I tried, four<br />\ntimes, to write that \"something<br />\nreally Brazilian\" that the editor<br />\nhad asked for. I tried to<br />\ndescribe the huge variety of the<br />\ncountry, the regional differences, the social issues, like<br />\nracism, sexism, and the role of<br />\nthe Church, and the political<br />\nand economic problems of<br />\ndependency, redemocratization, and the alarming levels of<br />\npoverty and hunger that are<br />\npresent, and the opportunity<br /><br />\nthat exists to study them, as it<br />\nis much easier to find original<br />\nground to break here in the<br />\nacademic field.

When I<br />\nread them, I knew somehow<br />\nthat that just wasn't it, for two<br />\nreasons. The first and most obvious being that, in an article<br />\nfor the News-Letter, you cannot really enter into those complex social issues, about which<br />\nI know extremely little, and give<br />\nany kind of complete notion of<br />\nthem. The other reason why it<br />\nhas taken me eight months to<br />\nwrite this article is that my head<br />\nhas been sent spinning by<br />\neverything I have encountered<br />\nhere. Not just due to those<br />\nsocial aspects, the richness and<br />\nvariety of it all, that I had tried<br />\nto relate in those first articles,<br />\nbut due to something else that<br />\nis impossible to describe on<br />\npaper\u2014confusion, the incredible mixture of everything. If<br />\nregional differences exist, say,<br />\nbetween the highly industrialized area of Sao Paulo and the<br />\npredominantly agricultural Nor'theast region; one faced with a<br />\nseries of modern urban problems, the other dominated by<br />\nan almost-feudalistic social<br />\nstructure where great land-0<br />\nowners carry out private wars<br />\nagainst each other. There is also<br />\na lot of the Northeast present in<br />\nSao Paulo\u2014not only because<br />\nof the amount of migrants who<br />\nflock to the city in search of<br />\nwork, but also in other terms,<br />\nthose of attitudes and behavior,<br />\neven among people born and<br />\nraised in Sao Paulo. And there<br />\nis a good deal of Sao Paulo in<br />\nthe Northeast. It is easy to find<br />\npeople who by day will plow<br />\ntheir small plots of land either<br />\nby hand or with a mule-drawn<br />\nplowshare and, at night, go<br />\nhome to a mud hut with a dirt<br />\nfloor, switch on the television,<br />\nand watch a soap-opera that<br />\ndeals with video-games, robots,<br />\nand computers. And it's not<br />\neven a matter of dividing<br /><br />\nday between the \"primitive<br />\npart\" and the \"modern part,\"<br />\nit's that these people literally<br />\nlive in two worlds (or more) at<br />\nthe same time. The parts are<br />\ndistinguishable, but they are so<br />\nintertwined that it is impossible<br />\nto categorize. That shakes an<br />\nAmerican up, because we are so<br />\nused to rationality and<br />\norganization, with a place for<br />\neverything and everything in its<br /><br />\nlace.<br />\nOther examples can be found<br />\nin those same social questions<br />\nraised earlier. Racism, for example, does and does not exist<br />\nhere, and on different levels. It<br />\nis much more common, and<br />\nless frowned-upon than in the<br />\nStates, to see racially-mixed<br />\ncouples.

The school<br />\nis located downtown in the<br />\nHenry Phipps Building, adjacent to the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical Hospital. Three<br />\nBaltimore-based hospitals\u2014<br />\nSinai, Church, and Johns<br /><br />\nNursing students working in<br /><br />\nHopkins\u2014are affiliated with<br />\nthe Hopkins University and<br />\nform an integral part of the<br />\nnursing program.<br />\nIn an interview, four students<br />\nin this first class, Bernie<br />\nKeenan, Marijoy Figueroa,<br />\nCecil Taylor, and Annie<br />\nStruntz, described the program.<br />\nIt is unique in the sense that the<br /><br />\nstudents not only lOrn current<br />\nclinical techniques,\"but are also<br />\ntaught the theories behind the<br />\nvarious practices and are taught<br />\nhow to apply their knowledge<br />\nto new situations which they<br />\nmay encounter. Attention is<br />\ngiven to the \"why to\" questions<br />\nas well as the \"how to\" questions. The trend today is<br />\ntoward higher education of<br />\nnurses, but the Hopkins pro-<br /><br />\nquisite, students entering the<br />\nprogram must have already<br />\ncompleted two years of<br />\nundergraduate education and<br />\ntaken courses in chemistry,<br />\nanatomy and physiology,<br />\nmicrobiology, as well as courses<br />\nin the humanities and social<br />\nsciences. The Hopkins nursing<br />\ncurriculum is divided into three<br />\nparts\u2014clinical work, practice<br />\nlaboratories, and lectures.<br />\nThe clinical work begins during the first week of the program. Students spend two days<br />\nper week at a hospital and<br />\nrotate approximately every<br />\nseven weeks to a new division.<br />\nThe divisions include geriatrics,<br />\npediatrics, obstetrics, medical<br />\nsurgery, psychology, and public<br />\nhealth. The students are supervised but have responsibilities<br />\nand duties similar to those of<br />\nthe licensed nurses (e.g. administering medication, taking<br />\ncase histories, charting patient<br />\ninformation, and providing patient education and comfort.)<br />\nStruntz, secretary of the<br />\nclass, explained that the human<br />\nelement and the patient's dignity are very important in nursing.

Only in the past decade,<br />\nhowever, has the binge-purge<br />\nsyndrome called bulimia been<br />\nrecognized as a disorder<br />\nseparate from anorexia.<br />\nDerived from the Greek<br />\nwords meaning \"ox\" and<br />\n\"hunger,\" bulimia was first<br />\ndescribed by Dr. Gerald Russell<br />\nin England. He listed two main<br />\ncriteria for diagnosis. First, the<br />\npatient feels an irresistable urge<br />\nto overeat, which is followed by<br />\nself-induced vomiting or purging. Second, these patients have<br />\nan extreme fear of fatness. According to Dr. Arnold Andersen, M.D., Assistant Professor<br />\nof Psychiatry and Behavioral<br />\nSciences at The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity School of Medicine,<br />\nboth anorexia and bulimia<br />\nbelong to a spectrum of eating<br />\ndisorders. Features commoa to<br />\nboth syndromes are a fear of<br />\nfatness, pursuit of thinness, and<br />\nfeelings of ineffectiveness,<br />\nespecially in stressful situations.<br />\nThe difference, however, is that<br />\nwhile the anorectic is able to<br />\nrestrict intake of food to the<br />\npoint of emaciation, the<br />\nbulimic's extreme urge to eat<br />\n\"breaks through\" that restric-<br /><br />\ntion, leading to extreme<br />\novereating. Because of the fear<br />\nof fatness, however, a sense of<br />\npanic occurs after the binge. A<br />\n\"second defense\" then follows,<br />\nin which the patient purges the<br />\nfood, either by vomiting or laxatives in order to prevent weight<br />\ngain. Sometimes a period of<br />\nstarvation or heavy exercise will<br />\nfollow binging, but these activities characterize anorexia<br />\nmore than bulimia. Another<br />\nmajor difference is that while<br /><br />\nhospitals. According to Dr. S.<br />\nAppling, a full-time professor<br />\nin the nursing program, working in the three hospitals is advantageous, since the students<br />\nare exposed to varied medical<br />\natmospheres and situations.<br />\nChurch is a small community<br />\nhospital. Sinai is a larger community hospital with a wellrehabilitation<br />\nrecognized<br />\ncenter, and the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital specializes in high risk<br />\ncases.<br />\nBesides clinical work, the<br />\nstudents also attend classes<br />\ndealing with such topics as<br />\nanatomy, psychology, sociology, human development,<br />\npharmacology, and pathophysiology. Classes are also given in<br />\nconjunction with and related to<br />\nthe students' clinical work.

His<br />\nappointment comes at a time of<br />\nexpansion and diversification<br />\nof the department. In a recent<br />\ninterview, Krolik discussed his<br />\nbackground and his work at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nKrolik is an astrophysicist.<br />\nMost of his time these days is<br />\nspent studying what are known<br />\nas active galactic nuclei; this has<br />\nbeen an interest of his since he<br />\ncompleted his thesis. At the<br />\ncenter of active galaxies, there<br />\nare very bright points of light,<br />\nthe total power of which can be<br />\n100 or 1000 times greater than<br />\nthe power from all the stars in<br />\nthe galaxy. These galaxies are<br />\nnot particularly larger or<br />\nsmaller than non-active ones<br />\nsuch as ours, nor are these<br />\ngalaxies tremendously different<br />\nfrom ordinary galaxies in their<br />\nother properties, so scientists<br />\ndo not really know what causes<br />\nthe bright center.<br />\nBy studying the spectra of the<br />\nlight received from these galaxies, it is known that whatever is<br />\nat the center, it is not made of<br />\nstars. Furthermore, scientists<br />\nare able to estimate the size of<br />\nthe power source. From relativity, it is known that light always<br />\ntravels at a constant speed and<br />\nnothing else can travel faster.<br />\nBy knowing the speed of light<br />\nand observing fluctuations in<br />\nthe brightness of nuclei, scien-<br /><br />\ntists can find the upper limit of<br />\nthe size of the nuclei. Because<br />\na fluctuatuion can only travel<br />\nacross the nucleus at a certain<br />\nrate, scientists can observe how<br />\nlong it takes to do so and can<br />\ncalculate the diameter of the<br />\nnucleus.<br />\nThe most violently fluctuating galactic nuclei have<br /><br />\nproject studying the wind of<br />\nstars.

From there,<br />\nhe went to the University of<br />\nCalifornia at Berkely for his<br />\nPh.D. Krolik did post-doctoral<br />\nwork at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.<br />\nThen he did more post-doctoral<br />\nwork back at MIT. After that<br />\nhe became a research associate<br />\nat Harvard. Finally, in 1984 he<br />\ncame to Hopkins as an assistant<br />\nprofessor at age 35.

The nursing program intends to expand<br />\nto include a graduate program<br />\nleading to a Master of Science<br />\ndegree in nursing. Student input<br />\nis welcomed by the faculty and<br />\nthe program as a whole is flexible.

Both disorders<br />\nbegin with the victims feeling<br />\nout of control of their lives and<br />\nparticularly with their changing<br />\nbodies during the teenage years.<br />\nMany cases of bulimia which<br />\nfirst appear when the patient is<br />\nin the early twenties are thought<br />\nto be the chronic outcome of<br />\nunsuccessfully treated anorexia.<br />\nRussell found that a large<br />\npercentage of his bulimic patients had, in fact, been anorectic during their teenage years.<br />\nThere are many personality<br />\ndifferences between bulimics<br />\nand anorectics. While both tend<br />\nto be self-critical and perfectionistic, bulimics seem to be<br />\nmuch more sensitive to inner<br />\ndistress and less able to resist<br /><br />\nurges. They are consequently<br />\nmore prone to act on impulse.<br />\nA small subgroup of bulimics<br />\nhave other disorders of impulse<br />\ncontrol, including drug and<br />\nalcohol abuse, promiscuity,<br />\nstealing, and suicidal tendencies. These characteristics are<br />\nnot found in anorectic patients.<br />\nBulimic patients are more<br />\noutgoing than anorectics, and<br />\nare more likely to engage in sexual activity. The typical anorectic, on the other hand, is a<br />\n\"model child,\" who often has<br />\nless personality development at<br />\nthe outset of the personality<br />\ndisorder, and becomes more<br />\nimmature and less able to relate<br />\nto others as starvation continues. Although the majority<br />\nof anorectics are women, it is<br />\nestimated that men comprise<br />\nfive to ten percent of all persons<br />\nwith eating disorders.<br />\nResearch has shown that patients with eating disorders are<br />\nmuch more likely to have family members with affective<br /><br />\ndisorders, which include mood<br />\ndisorders, alcoholism, and<br />\nobsessive-compulsive disorders.<br />\nMany patients with eating<br />\ndisorders develop affective<br />\ndisorders later in life.

The idea<br />\nis not to take away the anorexia or bulimia, but to make it unnecessary. Feeding into this are<br />\nother psychodynamic issues,<br />\nsuch as certain themes in the<br />\npatient's life, underlying selfimages, and relationships with<br />\nfamily members. Finally, after<br />\na long period of therapy, a<br />\ntransference develops in which<br />\nthe patient begins to act<br />\ntowards the therapist as he or<br />\nshe would toward other significant people in his or her life. By<br />\nunderstanding and making<br />\nchanges in these relationships,<br />\nthere's a change in fundamental orientation towards life,<br />\nwith a sense of more control,<br />\neffectiveness, and self-esteem,<br />\nand less fear of maturity.

When she phoned<br />\ntourney officials the night<br />\nshe<br />\ndeparture,<br />\nbefore<br />\nyet<br />\nnot<br />\nhad<br />\nthey<br />\ndiscovered that<br />\nreceived her entry, and, furthermore, that they had no room<br />\nfor her in the draw. Unruffled,<br />\nshe went anyway, and was<br />\ngiven a spot in the contest. She<br />\nmanaged to fight her way to the<br />\nfinal round, upsetting the first<br />\nseed on her way and bowing<br />\nonly in the finals to a University of Virginia graduate in four<br />\ngames. As a result of this accomplishment, she is now considered to be an A player, the<br />\nhighest level a player can attain<br />\nin this country, but she'll beat<br />\nyou up if you make any Mr. T<br />\njokes to her face.<br />\nChai had more company this<br />\npast weekend as Lisa Roy also<br />\nplayed in intercollegiates, held<br />\nin Williamstown, MA, at<br />\nWilliams College. Unfortunately for both, however, they drew<br />\nto face the No. 2 and No. 1<br />\nplayers, respectively, from<br />\nTrinity College, a Division I<br />\nschool.<br />\nIn a Friday morning match,<br />\nChai faced a somewhat<br />\nunsteady No. 6 seed, Kathy<br />\nCastle. However, Chai herself<br />\nwas obviously nervous, and,<br />\ngoing for winners, missed a lot<br />\nof tricky corner shots, and lost<br />\nthe first game at 4.<br />\nIn the second game, Chai<br />\nfought harder and gained<br />\neleven points en route to losing.<br />\nCool-headed and confident<br />\nfrom this score as well as settling into her own game, Chai<br />\nwon the next game 15-9. True,<br />\nCastle missed some easy shots,<br />\nbut Chai had her share of<br />\noutright winners, some of them<br />\nso well placed that her<br />\ndisconcerted opponent complemented \"Good shot\" in a<br />\nsubdued tone. Of the unseeded<br />\nplayers, Chai was definitely one<br />\nof the most formidable to run<br />\nacross in the first round, and<br />\nshe certainly surprised her opponent with her ability.<br />\nIt was too bad it did not last.<br />\nBoth players were nervous in<br />\nthe fourth game\u2014Chai because<br />\nshe realized the possibility of<br />\ncausing an upset, and Castle<br />\nbecause she felt the pressure of<br /><br />\nthe forehand side. Oddly, Irwin<br />\nran forward for the ball, which<br />\nwas already driven past both<br />\nplayers to the back court, and<br />\nran into Chai's racquet. The<br />\nlenses popped out of her<br />\nglasses' frames, and she appeared injured. Cowering in the<br />\ncorner for several minutes, she<br />\ndeferred taking an injury break<br />\nand continued playing. Proceeding at 1-all, both athletes<br />\ndisplayed spotty concentration,<br />\nespecially Chai, who was subjected to the hooting Smith<br />\nfans. This crowd made F&amp;M's<br />\nspectators seem sportsmanlike.<br />\nThough she kept the pressure<br />\non Irwin, she lost the third<br />\ngame 15-11, concluding her<br />\nfour-year Hopkins career.<br />\nAn informal team award<br />\nceremony was held at the anThe 1984-1985 Johns Hopkins women's squash team.

Individually, Andy Goldberg kept his title as MAC Foil Champion,<br />\nwhile Wales Shao and Chris<br />\nCalingaert took second and<br />\nfourth place titles respectively<br />\nin sabre and Tim Cook placed<br />\nfifth in epee.<br />\nThe MAC Tournament fielded ten teams this year, the<br />\nlargest in recent years. The addition of Army as well as other<br />\nschools made this year's MAC<br />\nmuch more competitive. Each<br />\nteam in the tournament was<br />\ncomposed of six fencers, two in<br />\neach weapon. The team winning the most bouts of all three<br />\nweapons combined was the<br />\nTeam<br />\nMAC 3-Weapon<br />\nChampion.<br />\nThe first match of the<br />\nMAC's saw Hopkins go against<br />\nTemple. The Jays, not forgetting their only defeat this year<br />\nto the Owls, trounced them by<br />\nwinning four of the six bouts.<br />\n\"Foiled again\" is what the<br />\nopposing teams must have been<br />\nthinking as the Hopkins foil<br />\nteam, for the second year in a<br />\nrow, captured the MAC Foil<br />\nTeam Champion title. Temple's<br />\nfoil team thought it had captured the title because it was<br />\nthree wins ahead when it finished its foil bouts. But the game<br />\nwas not over, because the Jays<br /><br />\nstill had three bouts left to<br />\nfence.<br />\nWith Goldberg having<br />\nalready finished his bouts with<br />\nan 8-1 record, the pressure was<br />\non foil captain Toby Chai to<br />\nwin all three of his remaining<br />\nbouts. After winning two easy<br />\nones, Chai faced a tough<br />\nHaverford opponent. The bout<br />\nwas close, but Chai won in the<br />\nclosing seconds to go 7-2 for the<br />\nday.<br />\nThis win not only put the<br />\nHopkins foil team in first place,<br />\nbut also proved to be Hopkins'<br />\nlast victory which gave them the<br />\nMAC Three-Weapon Team<br />\nChampion title.<br />\nGoldberg continued to prove<br />\nhis fencing prowess as he remains the MAC Foil Champion. After going 8-1 in the foil<br />\nround, he went<br />\nteam<br />\nundefeated in the finals to keep<br />\nhis crown. The junior finished<br />\nthis year with an impressive<br />\n58-5 record. He has a sure shot<br />\nat qualifying to the NCAA<br />\nTournament to be held later<br />\nthis year at Notre Dame<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe sabre lineup, which was<br />\nunknown until a few moments<br />\nbefore the MAC's, starred<br />\nWales Shao and Chris Calingaert. Calingaert finished the<br />\nsabre team round with a record<br />\nof 7-2, while Shao finished 8-1<br />\nin his pool. Shao's last win proved to be the decisive one for<br />\nthe Hopkins sabre team as they<br />\ncaptured the Team Champion<br />\ntitle. Both qualified for the<br />\nsabre individual finals.<br />\nUnbelievably, there was a<br />\n4-way tie for first place in the<br />\nfinals, with Calingaert and<br />\nShao being two of the four<br />\nfencers in that tie. Fencing rules<br />\nsay that there must be a fenceoff between the four fencers<br />\n(round robin of four) to deter-<br /><br />\nmine a winner. After the smoke<br />\ncleared, Shao was second, while<br />\nCalingaert finished fourth.<br />\nIn the first match of the tournament against Temple, the<br />\nHopkins epee team of Tim<br />\nCook and Russ Carstens, provided two of the four victories<br />\nfor the Blue Jays. Although this<br />\nyear's epee team was considered to have the best shot out<br />\nof the three weapons at clinching a team championship,<br />\nthey wound up in a tight race<br />\nwith Army and Temple.<br />\nAfter the epee team bouts<br />\nwere over, Hopkins was only<br />\ntwo wins away from having its<br />\nthird weapon team champion<br />\ntitle. Cook finished 7-2 in the<br />\nteam round and went on to take<br />\nfifth place individually.<br />\nCarstens, who had a tough day,<br />\nfinished 5-4 in the team round,<br />\nalthough three of Carstens'<br /><br />\nwins were against tougher<br />\nopponents.<br />\nThe Hopkins men's fencing<br />\nteam was strongly tested<br />\nthroughout this year, but the<br />\nJay swordsmen have stuck<br />\ntogether and come through<br />\nwith victory after victory.
