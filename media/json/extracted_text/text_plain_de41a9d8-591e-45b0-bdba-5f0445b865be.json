Whether the solution lies<br />\nin constructing a new Union or in refiguring the current one remains a controversial question.<br />\n\"There was a time when the building did<br />\nmeet student needs, but now the student<br />\npopulation has increased significantly<br />\nalong with the number of student groups<br />\nSee PROGRAMMING, 7<br />\n<br />\n\fNEW'S-LETTER/7<br />\n<br />\nUnion's limitations hamper social programming<br />\nPROGRAMMING, from 6<br />\nand also the level of participation,\" said<br />\nPorter. \"At this point the needs have<br />\noutgrown the building.\"<br />\nAccording to Porter, a focus of campus<br />\nactivity where students could gather informally would not only yield more space for<br />\nactivities but also enhance student interaction. \"And that's a real need that the<br />\nHuman Climate Task Force Report has<br />\nrecognized,\" she said.<br />\nLack of interaction at Hopkins, explained Porter, \"creates a sense of isolation.<br />\nStudents leave the dorms after freshman<br />\nyear, they have a limited amount of time,<br />\nand this isn't an easy school. There's no<br />\nplace for all undergraduates to gather informally and people get tied into a clique.\"<br />\nBoth the Human Climate Task Force and<br />\nthe administration recognize the need for<br />\na new union. The actual construction of a<br />\nnew union, however, is a complex issue.<br />\n\"Clearly, the Human Climate Task<br />\nForce Report indicated a strong interest<br />\nand need for additional space,\" said<br />\nRobert Welch, dean of administration. \"I<br />\nthink that there may very well exist a<br />\npossibility down the road of raising some<br />\nmoney.\"<br />\n<br />\nFinances, agreed Provost and Vice<br />\nPresident for Academic Affairs John Lombardi, are always a problem. Yet, he asserted, \"there are a lot of alumni who are<br />\ninterested in student life and who would<br />\nbe willing to fund and organize a coherent<br />\nprogram designed to solve the problems at<br />\nHopkins. Our task is to get a consensus on<br />\ncampus on how these concerns should be<br />\naddressed and what the program should<br />\nlook like.<br />\n\"The task of the next Dean is to pick up<br />\nthe momentum begun by Dean Welch in<br />\norder to bring this issue toward an actionoriented closure somtime within the next<br />\nacademic year,\" he concluded.<br />\nWhile students, faculty, administrators,<br />\nand alumni agree that the problem of<br />\nlimited space and the need for more interaction must be addressed, reaching a<br />\nconsensus on exactly how this agreement<br />\nshould be reached is difficult.<br />\nAccording to Lombardi, Hopkins' small<br />\nand specialized student population, as well<br />\nas the University's unique historical<br />\nbackground as an all-male, graduate<br />\nschool, creates particular concerns.<br />\n\"At Hopkins, there hasn't been an entirely<br />\ntypical<br />\ndevelopment<br />\nof<br />\nundergraduate student life,\" he said.<br />\n<br />\n\"We're unordinary, and we're organized<br />\nto be that way. This, I feel, is not a defect<br />\nbut a virtue. However, Hopkins' special<br />\nstudent body and history make it hard to<br />\nfind an appropriate external guide to extracurricular support for us to follow.\"<br />\nPresent facilities, he explained, were<br />\ndesigned to be \"generic\" in order to meet<br />\nthe changing needs of a small student body.<br />\n\"The Arellano Theatre, for example, was<br />\ntailored to be generic,\" he said. \"This<br />\ngeneration may see it as a theater, the next<br />\nmay perhaps see it as a debate hall. It can<br />\nbe accommodated to serve changing functions. Naturally, you could also say that<br />\nit doesn't do anything exactly right.\"<br />\nProviding additional space, said Lombardi, should be less of an issue than the<br />\nenhancing of student activity.<br />\n\"The way students need to think of it is<br />\nessentially as a trade-off between money<br />\nwhich could be spent for student activities<br />\nand money which will have to be spent for<br />\nthe upkeep of an actual facility,\" he said.<br />\n\"Students should spend their time and<br />\nenergy on what they want to do, and work<br />\nfrom there on the facilities.\"<br />\nA new union, both Lombardi and Welch<br />\nestimated, would take at least five years<br />\nto complete. The process includes a needs<br />\n<br />\nassessment and feasibility study, an architectural study, a fund-raising campaign,<br />\nand the actual construction, provided that<br />\nall parties involved can agree on what<br />\nshould be done.<br />\n\"I don't know if we need an actual<br />\nbuilding,\" said Lombardi. \"I'm not<br />\nprepared to say that the first priority to<br />\nstudents should be bricks and mortar. What<br />\nstudents need to do is DO\u2014and get the<br />\nmaximum benefit from their time here.\"<br />\nThe administration, according to Lombardi, regards the quality of student life in<br />\nterms of three issues: housing, athletic<br />\nfacilities, and a union. Housing, he said,<br />\ntakes priority over the second two, but<br />\nathletic facilities and a union are of equal<br />\nimportance. In addition, \"there are the soft<br />\nquestions of programming and support.<br />\n\"Quality of student life is one of the administration's top two priorities for the<br />\nHomewood campus, along with financial<br />\nstability,\" continued Lombardi. \"The<br />\nschool of Arts and Sciences must be financially stable so that the academic quality<br />\nof Hopkins is preserved\u2014that's first.

Since he had<br />\nno personal friends in the homosexual<br />\ncommunity and the disease affected only<br />\na small segment of the population,<br />\n<br />\nSchneiderman recalled that he was not interested in the AIDS story.<br />\nThe failure of reporters to investigate<br />\nAIDS, he realized, resulted in a lack of<br />\n\"pressure. . . on the President to<br />\nsignificantly fund AIDS research.\"<br />\n\"Gays are concerned about being accused of pushing too far and too fast, so they<br />\ntend to ease up,\" he said. \"At the same<br />\ntime, 'straights' publicly proclaim their unbounded support for gay causes, but not<br />\nin ways that threaten to disturb their lives.<br />\nSo no one was pushing me very hard for<br />\ncoverage about this unknown disease.<br />\n\"Snobbery also played a role in the<br />\nstory,\" he continued.

Students spoke of plans to go<br />\nhome,just when it seemed that everything was<br />\ngetting back to normal. But wait\u2014they're all<br />\njust leaving for the weekend.<br />\nThis weekend is a religious one for many<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community. Christians<br />\nwill be celebrating Easter this Sunday; for Jews,<br />\nthis evening marks the beginning of Passover.<br />\nWhile these holidays are not as commercially<br />\npopular as their December counterparts, they<br />\nare certainly just as religiously important, if not<br />\nmore so. However, never has any vacation time<br />\nbeen given so that students and faculty who<br />\nwish to celebrate these holidays may do so.<br />\nThose who wish to spend the holidays with<br />\nfamily are forced into planning exceedingly<br />\nshort trips; others live too far from Baltimore<br />\nto make such a short trip feasible.<br />\nThe campus religious groups have special<br />\nholiday services and meals planned;<br />\nnonetheless, there is still something nicer about<br />\nbeing able to spend important holidays like<br />\nthese with family.<br />\nGranted, Hopkins is not a religiuosly oriented<br />\ninstitution. Still, there is no reason why some<br />\n<br />\nrecognition cannot be given to this weekend's<br />\nholidays. Even the Baltimore County public<br />\nschools are off today and Monday.<br />\nEaster and Passover don't fall on the same<br />\nweekend every year, so administrators might<br />\nbe reluctant to begin providing vacations for<br />\nthe holidays. But seniors will recall that the<br />\nsame thing happened three years ago. A little<br />\nbit more flexibility in scheduling might allow<br />\nfor a small vacation on those two or three-year<br />\nintervals when the holidays fall together. Or had<br />\nSpring Break been pushed back one week this<br />\nyear, things would have been much nicer for<br />\nmany of us.<br />\nThere are, no doubt, many complex problems<br />\nin scheduling the academic calendar. But we<br />\nurge those who plan it to be sensitive to the<br />\nEaster and Passover calendar dates, and consider a small vacation for this important<br />\nweekend when it occurs again. There are many<br />\namong us who consider these holidays to be an<br />\nimportant part of their religious and cultural<br />\nheritage, and it is sad to think that our academic<br />\ndevelopment must always take place at the expense of the other two.<br />\n<br />\nA Little Leeway<br />\nChance Meetings<br />\nby A.

One of the<br />\nmore traumatic childhood experiences which made me what I<br />\nam today involved my pursuit of<br />\na \"friend\" through the streets of<br />\nEast Greenwich. I'll never forget<br />\nthe \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" horror which filled my being as he turned and said, \"I'm<br />\nnot Charlie.\"<br />\nLast week, I went out to dinner with my brother and his<br />\nfiance. Half way through my sole<br />\nflorentine, a middle-age woman<br />\napproached our table. \"Excuse<br />\nme,\" she said to Asa, \"but aren't<br />\nyou George? You went to<br />\nAssumption with my son Danny.\"<br />\n\"No,\" Asa replied, \"sorry.\"<br />\nI didn't miss my chance to break<br />\nin.<br />\n\"Don't lie to the poor woman,<br />\nGeorge,\" I said to Asa. \"You're<br />\nsuch a joker. That's what Danny<br />\nalways liked about you.\" The<br />\nwoman eyed him for a moment,<br />\nthen glanced back at me. I didn't<br />\nmiss a beat. \"You always tell me<br />\nabout the one you put over on<br />\nDanny when you guys were in<br />\nBoston. Did he ever tell you<br />\nthat?\u2014 Meanwhile, Asa mumbled, \"No, shut up, shut up.\" At<br />\nlast, she retired to augment her<br />\nconfusion with another martini,<br />\nleaving our table to recount all<br />\n<br />\nour Great Mistaken Identity<br />\nanecdotes.<br />\nAsa spoke first. During his<br />\nsophomore year, he had gone out<br />\none night with a few of his buddies. They were a racous bunch,<br />\nbarely able to squeeze into two<br />\ncars. By the time they left the bar,<br />\nthey were all feeling a bit impish.<br />\nAt a stop light, his friends in the<br />\nfirst car leapt out of their respective doors, and jumped against<br />\nthe windows of the second car,<br />\nsending its occupants(Asa included) into a frightened tizzy. The<br />\nraiders piled back into their car,<br />\nand Asa stewed until the next<br />\nlight. There, the Man With A<br />\nMission threw open his door, ran<br />\nbroken-field through the traffic,<br />\nand jumped onto his quarry's<br />\nroof. He thrust his head into the<br />\nsunroof and emitted a primal<br />\nscream which shook the<br />\nstreetlights. Only after the guttural roar died in his throat did he<br />\nrealize that his friend's car didn't<br />\nhave a sunroof, and that he was<br />\nnot staring down at a bunch of<br />\nstultified college chums, but at six<br />\nvery unappreciative men with a<br />\nfondness for black leather, tatoos,<br />\nand chains. A sprint earned in<br />\nmany hours of after-school practice brought him safely back to<br />\nthe car, but it was his bad luck to<br />\nhave his friend Tom, a stoic German, at the wheel. \"I will not<br />\ngo,\" he told Asa, \"the light is<br />\nred.\" Only after the equation<br />\n\"swinging chains +sheet metal<br />\nequals body shop\" became clear<br />\ndid Tom forget his Old World<br />\nsensibilties and lay down some<br />\ntracks.<br />\nMy grandfather then chipped in<br />\n<br />\nSee LEEWAY, 11<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nEditors<br />\nJulie Levine, Flory Ware<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

By the<br />\ntime we had finished our bird'snest and pot of tea, my watch read<br />\n1 a.m. It was cold, but I had on<br />\na long, somber overcoat which<br />\nprotected me from the biting<br />\nwind. As we left the restaurant,<br />\nsomething in a window display<br />\ncaught my eye and Lisa walked<br />\na few steps ahead of me. When<br />\nI again ambled on along the<br />\n<br />\nsidewalk, I saw her reach out to<br />\ntake the arm of a man walking<br />\njust in front of her, a man in a<br />\nlong black overcoat, with dark<br />\nhair like my own, standing within<br />\nan inch or two of my own height.<br />\nFirst, she tried to hook her arm<br />\nthrough his. This he shrugged off<br />\nwith a twist at the waist. Next,<br />\nshe grabbed for his elbow. Again,<br />\nhe evaded seizure. Visibly exasperated at her \"fiance's'. unorthodox behavior, Lisa at first<br />\nmade a move for the hand in the<br />\npocket, but then, throwing subtlety to the wind, grasped his elbow<br />\nand pulled, twisting the man<br />\ntowards her. Certain that he was<br />\nbeing accosted, the man gave a<br />\nlittle yelp. Lisa didn't say a word,<br />\njust petrified on the spot. (Incidently, I decided not to purchase this winter's fashion trend,<br />\nthe bomber jacket, in the hopes<br />\nthat this type of episode will not<br />\nrepeat itself.)<br />\nWhile no one would argue that<br />\ntaking someone for someone else<br />\nisn't embarrassing, being the<br />\ntakee is no picnic either.

He began<br />\nby cautioning, \"Oh, Muller was fine. He<br />\nalways seemed to have time to come down<br />\nto Florida to shoot and never bitched<br />\nabout longing for Baltimore. He was just<br />\na victim of circumstances.\"<br />\nScheduled to play Tammy Faye Bakker<br />\nhad been singer Cyndi Lauper. \"We got<br />\nthrough most of the shooting with her, but<br />\nshe lost her popularity, you know,\"said<br />\nWaters. \"Furthermore, she hired Joyce<br />\nBrown, the homeless woman who refused<br />\ntreatment in New York, as her costume<br />\ndesigner, and while it's nice picturing<br />\nTammy Faye wearing soda cans, it didn't<br />\nfit the image.\"<br />\nLauder was subsequently dropped from<br />\nthe cast. \"We tried others, \"said Waters.<br />\n\"But once we thought we had Phyllis<br />\nDiller, she re-did her face and now looks<br />\nlike Queen Elizabeth, so we gave up.\"<br />\nThe second major role, that of Jim Bakker, was to have been filled by Bronson<br />\nPinchot of ABC's Perfect Strangers.<br />\nWaters explained that Pinchot had the<br />\nhumor for the part, but not the muscle.<br />\n\"You see, he got too caught up in his<br />\nTV role, \" said Waters. \"When ABC<br />\ndecided to move Perfect Strangers to Friday night, Bronson took it all too literally<br />\nand wrenched his back. So we dropped<br />\nJim Bakker him.\"<br />\nWaters continued,\"We then tried to in\"Oh please, please let me play Jimmy Swaggart. I beg you, I am experienced at this, so ject some realism by hiring Jim Bakker to<br />\nplease, please have mercy on me.\"<br />\nplay himself. That was fine until we got<br />\n<br />\nto the sex scenes. Bakker was uncooperative, neglecting the script and insisting on performing the scenes the way<br />\nthey really happened.<br />\n\"Well, as you can imagine, the mannequin that we used as Jessica Hahn couldn't<br />\nstand up to the torture, \"said Waters. \"So<br />\nwe dropped the part from the script.\"<br />\nThe other major player to go was Robin<br />\nWilliams, who was hired to play Jerry<br />\nFalwell.<br />\n\"Robin was fine,'said Waters, \"unti!<br />\nhe got the opportunity to play Adrian<br />\nCronauer in Good Morning, Vietnam. That<br />\nleft us without a Falwell, so we hired Ed<br />\nMeese, the attorney general.\"<br />\nMeese, however, slowed the schedule.<br />\n''He kept taking all the extras out to the<br />\nbars with money he got from who-knowswhere, \" said Waters. \"He certainly<br />\nwasn't earning enough from us or his job<br />\nas attorney general to have that kind of<br />\nmoney. So we dropped him from the<br />\ncast.\"<br />\nThat left Muller as the only principal.<br />\nWaters then decided to change the movie<br />\ninto a running account of Swaggart's sermons. Since the film was already $5<br />\nmillion over budget, Waters could not hire<br />\nreal people for the sermon audiences,<br />\nso he hired the Smurfs.<br />\n\"Yes, I know they're blue,\" he said.<br />\n\"But they didn't talk back, and we figured<br />\nthat we could play with some color filters<br />\nuntil they were of body color.\"<br />\nThe film wrapped in January, before the<br />\nSwaggart sex scandal surfaced. Waters explained that he and the studio threw up<br />\ntheir hands in disgust following Swaggart's<br />\ntelevised confession of sin.<br />\n\"As you might expect, we had to change<br />\nthe cast again, \" said Waters. \"We<br />\nbrought in Samantha Fox from England to<br />\nplay the prostitute. We've been giving her<br />\nvoice-coaching lessons to get rid of her<br />\nBritish accent. She's a slow learner, but<br />\nI like working with her, as does everyone<br />\nelse.<br />\n<br />\nJerry Falwell<br />\n<br />\nMuller can stop practicing now.<br />\n<br />\n\"At this point, Muller became our probkm,,\" continued Waters. \"You see, we<br />\nneeded a novice at sex for maximum effect, but Muller had forty years of experience at this, so when we put him in bed<br />\nwith Sam, he had all the right moves. She<br />\nbrought out the animal in him. \u2014<br />\nA replacement for Muller had not been<br />\nfound.

I certain-<br />\n<br />\nly don't envision the University<br />\npricing itself out of the market.\"<br />\nAt the very least, concluded<br />\nWelch, the extra housing might<br />\nhelp sustain a sense of a close-knit<br />\ncommunity that some students<br />\nmay lose by living apart from<br />\nother classmates. \"We realize<br />\nstudents may lose a sense of togetherness after freshman year,\"<br />\nsaid Welch. \"We're hoping the<br />\nconstruction can help.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LITTER/5<br />\n<br />\nWe can't think of a headline for this article<br />\n<br />\nCalling education here \"unsafe for any creed,\" consumer advocate Ralph Nader came to Hopkins Tuesday<br />\nto discuss the dangers of attending Hopkins.<br />\nThe new organization, Lyceum, sponsored Nader's<br />\nspeech, titled \"Sitting Complacent in Blue Jay Way,\"<br />\nas part of its series \"How to Address Problems in the<br />\nWorld Today, Yesterday, and in the Future.\"<br />\nLyceum's community leader, Aliasghar Mohyuddin, introduced Nader as \"a man who has devoted his life to<br />\nmaking the world a happier place to be in. And that's what<br />\nLyceum strives to be, a happy communal organization that<br />\ntakes any issue, no matter how big, small, or irrelevant,<br />\nand puts it into a perspective of peace, love, and<br />\nunderstanding for the protection of life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and all things bright and beautiful.\"<br />\nNader then took over the podium. \"I've been keeping<br />\nmy eye on this University for a long time,\"he said. \"I<br />\ncan now safely determine\u2014remember that word, safe\u2014<br />\nthat the University is in serious danger of losing its reputation as a party school. Thank you.\" Nader then sat down.<br />\nMohyuddin then opened the floor for questions. \"Any<br />\nquestions?\" he asked the bewildered audience.<br />\n\"Yes,\"said Spring Fair Chairperson Jonathan Siegel.<br />\n\"Mr. Nader, we all know Hopkins has a reputation for<br />\nbeing a throat school, not a party school. How can you<br />\nsay we have a reputation as a party school?\"<br />\nNader responded, \"Well, you know, lacrosse parties,<br />\nbeach parties, small parties, I mean parties are healthy,<br />\nbut some students don't mix parties\u2018vith their work, and<br />\nthat's unhealthy. College students should find a bright mix<br />\nof work and parties to make their experiences better.\"<br />\nMohyuddin chimed in,\"A very perceptive statement,<br />\nand one that should make everyone, feel good about<br />\nthemselves. Any more uplifting questions? Lloyd?\"<br />\n<br />\nLloyd Armstrong, Jr., dean of the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences, rose. \"Mr. Nader,\"he said, \"my school is<br />\nfighting a budget deficit that will surely impact upon<br />\nundergraduate education, but the University won't finance<br />\nit. Doesn't that bode ill for undergraduate education here?\"<br />\nNader thought. \"It's certainly a serious problem, but<br />\nI assure you the University will find some way to eliminate<br />\nthe deficit without affecting the undergraduates, or even<br />\nthe ability to attract professors and research grants.\"<br />\nMohyuddin cut in, \"Oh glory, glory! A University of<br />\nlove! Now, I have to leave, but I will turn over the podium<br />\nto my wonderful assistant, Joy Starlight. Any more uplifting questions? Fit-?' Mohyuddin then left.<br />\n\"Thank you,\" said Student Council President FitzGerald. \"I'm losing control. What do I do?\"<br />\nNader responded, \"Take two aspirin, eat an apple a<br />\nday, and be happy.\"<br />\nStarlight broke up. \"Here you have a man who is not<br />\nonly intelligent but unbearably funny. This is too much.<br />\nI've got to control myself.\" She ran out of the room.<br />\nSomeone spoke. \"Mr. Nader, I am Hoppy the Rubber<br />\nChicken, mascot of The Black and Blue Jay,\"said an<br />\nidiot dressed in a chicken suit. \"How does the tailwagging of the Corvair impact upon our $11,000 tuition?\"<br />\nNader sprung to life. \"The Corvair! Don't make me<br />\ntalk about the Corvair! I'm sick of it\u2014it's a dead issue,<br />\nand I like talking about things that are alive.\"<br />\nStarlight returned. \"Well, it's nice to see that even in<br />\nmy absence, people are talking about things alive and<br />\nbright. That's what makes Lyceum so special. Any more<br />\nquestions?\" Pause. \"Seeing none, I'd like to thank Ralph<br />\nNader for his perceptive, interesting, and provocative<br />\nspeech.

Headache<br />\n<br />\n7576649403447<br />\n<br />\nThere are so many problems here. We<br />\nhave so little housing; our athletic facilities<br />\nare so poor; the School of Arts and Sciences<br />\nis shrinking and will probably stay in the<br />\nred for a good period of time; non-academic<br />\nconcerns are threatened to extinction with<br />\nthe subordination of a director of student<br />\nservices; we lack a sense of community<br />\nwhich breeds apathy and intolerance between sexes, races and segments of<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nBut gosh, it's no one's fault, really, and<br />\nthe University is trying very hard to address<br />\nall of those problems. Our school has<br />\nalways shown the degree of prudence and<br />\ninsight necessary to appropriately restructure administrative organization so as to<br />\nbenefit the community.<br />\nHistory has had students manifest varying degrees of concern for the issues confronting a university. The administration is<br />\n<br />\nsentient to the fact that students are currently demanding involvement and solutions for<br />\nthe problems facing us. With such<br />\nunderstanding of this and it offers a great<br />\ndeal of perspective, we expect that plans<br />\nsoon emerge and concretize that<br />\nwill<br />\n_<br />\nwill put Homewood on the corrective path.<br />\nThere can be no overstating the importance for students to appreciate the administration's efforts\u2014and understand the<br />\nlimitations of this University with regards<br />\nto fiscal matters and structure. Tangential<br />\nproblems such as tenure policy and declaring Gilman Hall a landmark reverberate<br />\nrepercussions through major issues.<br />\nAll of this boils down to a pledge of<br />\nmoderation on everyone's part. It is incumbent on each of us to let our opinions be<br />\nheard, and listen to the response. It may<br />\nnot always be to our liking\u2014but certainly<br />\nit will contribute to our communal benefit.<br />\n<br />\nE ()maniacs<br />\nCute Colombo<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI was appalled at the sadistic attempt of humor that James<br />\nRosen's With Eyes Closed cartoon contained in the Feb. 12th<br />\nissue. I know and accept the fact<br />\nthat for years now Goucher College has been considered a<br />\nplaypen by many Hopkins<br />\nstudents. Most Hopkins men feel<br />\nthat Goucher students are prewed, or are just here for their<br />\nMrs. degree. They also believe<br />\nthat we all melt at advances from<br />\nfuture doctors or deans. Although<br />\nI, and many of my friends, do<br />\nfind Dean Colombo cute in a teddy bear sort of way, it would take<br />\nmore than just a condom for him<br />\nto get to know me better. We<br />\nGoucher guys have our<br />\nprinciples\u2014at least dinner<br />\nfirst. . . .<br />\nHugh G. Reckshun<br />\nGoucher Guy<br />\n<br />\nNews-Litter Abuse<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nRecently certain people have<br />\nbeen abusing this once great letters page. It seems that every<br />\nother letter uses this page to say<br />\nthings that don't belong here. For<br />\nexample, candidates in the last<br />\nfew elections have acknowledged their candidacies here, told of<br />\ntheir stance on school issues,<br />\nbrown nosed the N-L on a job<br />\nwell done, and then gone on to<br />\nsay that they won't use this page<br />\nto talk about the election. I mean,<br />\ncome on. I am running for SC<br />\nPrez next year, and if! win I will<br />\ngive each of my voters $5, but I<br />\nwon't use this space to talk about<br />\nit. Instead call me collect some<br />\ntime and we'll talk.<br />\nEven better, some school<br />\ngroups think that this is campus<br />\nnuts. It is not. I don't care when<br />\nyour next meeting is, and if! did<br />\nI would read about it on the back<br />\npage. I probably can't make it<br />\nthough, as The Pornography Club<br />\nwill be having a meeting Monday<br />\n<br />\nor Fairy Tale Theatre<br />\nIt must be difficult for you, my<br />\nfaithful readers, having to sit idly by and watch my works of<br />\nliterary wonder being turned into trash by the master editors,<br />\nBrad and Liz. Just last week, this<br />\nconniving pair elected to cut four<br />\nwords from my article!

The album firmly established Lunkhead as a musical<br />\nforce to be reckoned with, but<br />\ncuts like \"Pepperoni and Nitro\"<br />\n(which went to No. 3 on the<br />\nEuropean charts) indicated that<br />\nsongwriter and lead vocalist<br />\nDieter Grossenschwanz still had<br />\nsome room for improvement.<br />\nOn their latest album, Slugfest,<br />\nthe Lunkers demonstrate a new-<br />\n<br />\nfound musical sensibility that<br />\nmight finally win them some attention in the States. The album<br />\ncenters around an annual festival<br />\nheld in Lunkhead's hometown of<br />\nMiezen, located in Southern<br />\nBavaria. The festival originally<br />\nbegan as a celebration by the survivors of the Black Plague, but<br />\nwhen it was time to gather up the<br />\nfood for the festival, it was<br />\ndiscovered that everything had<br />\ndied or been killed. The only<br />\nthing left were some slugs that<br />\nhad crawled into the local<br />\nbrewery in search of some<br />\nbeer\u2014and Slugfest was born. According to the liner notes, some<br />\neffort has been made in recent<br />\nyears to abolish the festival, but<br />\ncommunity leaders have kept it<br />\non as a link to the past. Where<br />\nLunkhead comes down on this<br />\nissue is unclear, but the festival<br />\nseems to have inspired them to<br />\ntheir best album yet. The first<br />\nsingle, \"Slimy Trails,\" is a surprisingly evocative ballad that<br />\nfeatures guitarist Erik von Stenz<br />\non twelve string, and a wailing<br />\nalto sax doing background fills\u2014<br />\nquite a departure from the crunching guitar of their earlier album<br />\nand songs like \"Fuel-Injected<br />\nDeath Machine.\" Have no fear<br />\nthat Lunkhead has sold out,<br />\nhowever, because there's enough<br />\nof the old blazing axe-work on<br />\nhere to satisfy even the most diehard fans. Their next single from<br />\nthe album is entitled \"Salt Shaker<br />\n<br />\nfrom Hell,\" and it promises to<br />\nmelt your stereo speakers into a<br />\nblack and woodgrain mess<br />\n(rumour has it that drummer<br />\nRollo Rotz destroyed his drupkit<br />\nduring the initial recording sessions, and that taping was held off<br />\nfor several weeks while his body<br />\nwas allowed to heal from the flying splinters of metal. Heavy<br />\nmetal is right!) My personal<br />\nfavorite, however, would have to<br />\nbe \"Beer in the Garden,\" which<br />\nmanages to talk about the lure and<br />\ndanger of overindulgence,<br />\nwithout resorting to being<br />\npreachy. \"There's always beer in<br />\nthe garden for you/go ahead.<br />\nhave a drink or two/What're you<br />\nwaiting for/'fraid your body'll<br />\nwash up on the shore?\" Such<br />\ncrisp and expressive lyricism<br />\ncharacterizes Slugfest, and,<br />\nhopefully, is indicative of more<br />\ngreat things to come from<br />\nLunkhead.<br />\n<br />\nTHE CONCERT<br />\nLast Thursday, I had a chance<br />\nto see one of the greatest mostly<br />\nliving rock and roll bands ever.<br />\nThey are LUNKHEAD,and they<br />\ncame to conquer.<br />\nTickets were twenty-five bucks<br />\nfrom some grizzled hippy taking<br />\ntime off from the latest Dead<br />\ntour.

They<br />\nknew what kind of crowd<br />\nLUNKHEAD attracted and the<br />\nkind of trouble they made. Middle age bikers, acid casualties and<br />\ncollege paper editors. It's a<br />\nviolent combination and they<br />\nwere ready for us with tear gas,<br />\nwater guns and piles of Soldier of<br />\nFortune magazines. I heard the<br />\ncops saying something about<br />\npacifying the crowd with intense<br />\nbursts of sound. I wanted to laugh<br />\nout loud and scream to him,<br />\n'Hah, you fool! That'd never<br />\nwork. That's what we're here<br />\nfor!' God, I thought, I love rock<br />\nconcerts.<br />\nIt takes us almost an hour to<br />\nfind our seats and another twenty minutes to convince these to<br />\ngeezers that they're in our seats.<br />\nWe're just about to kick them out<br />\nphysically when we notice their<br />\nmetal tipped canes. Holy Diamond Ball, I think, these dudes<br />\nare Gray Panthers.

We'd have<br />\nto watch our step. This was no<br />\nkid's show.<br />\nThe opening act comes and the<br />\ncrowd instantly lets them know<br />\nwhat they think of them. The<br />\nband plays for ten minutes then<br />\nretreats in a hail of mucus and<br />\nbeer cans. The nest group comes<br />\non. Same thing happens, only<br />\nfaster. Then comes a group<br />\nwhose name I've actually heard.<br />\nI hate them. They're one of those<br />\ngroups that break up, reform,<br />\ntour and make loads of money off<br />\nof unsuspecting teenagers with<br />\nbad family lives and even worst<br />\ntaste in music. You may<br />\nremember them in some of their<br />\nprevious incarnations: Emerson,<br />\nLake, and FILL-IN THE<br />\nBLANK. This time around<br />\n<br />\nthey're taking a comedic slant by<br />\nincluding Peewee Herman on<br />\ndrums. (No word yet as to<br />\nwhether he'll be asked to OD.)<br />\nAnyway, they start playing but<br />\nthe crowd completely ignores<br />\nthem until Peewee jumps out<br />\nfrom behind the drrums after his<br />\nsolo and bites the head off a rubber chicken. Ooh boy, they loved that one.<br />\nAt last the men we came to see<br />\nmake it to the stage. They arrive<br />\non the backs of giant mechanical<br />\nslugs, celebrating the release of<br />\ntheir latest album, SLUGFEST.<br />\nNow few bands are as consistently experimental as<br />\nLUNKHEAD and even fewer<br />\nwould dare start out their show<br />\nwith a drum solo but there it<br />\nis.Heinrich Mulfer, the band's<br />\ndrummer, is a mster of both<br />\nCeltic and Yiddish rhythmic<br />\nforms and he pounds them out<br />\nlike nobody's business. When it<br />\nends, some twenty minutes later,<br />\nthe audience erupts into applause.<br />\nThen the whole band launches into the new single, \"Saltshaker<br />\nfrom Hell\" which features a driving bass line, explosive drums, and a screaming<br />\nguitar solo that sends the crowd<br />\ninto convulsions.<br />\nFrom this point on, the concert<br />\nbecomes an unending stream of<br />\nraw,jagged, unrelenting, socially aware noise. The sound system<br />\nis so loud it could part your hair<br />\nat ten thousand feet; one of the<br />\nolder commented happily that he<br />\nhadn't had to wear his hearing aid<br />\nat all. The lighting blazes white<br />\nhot, tearing brightly colored holes<br />\nthrough the clouds sent up by the<br />\nsmoke machines. During the<br />\nclimactic \"Beer in the Garden\"<br />\nnumber, lead guitarist, Loomis<br />\nWatkins, actually lights his<br />\ncigarette on one of the rotating<br />\nlaser lights. It was one of ;the<br />\nhigh points of rock and roll<br />\nhistory and you missed it.<br />\nFinally, after the sixth score,<br />\nLUNKHEAD left the stage for<br />\nthe last time, leaving the audience<br />\nin what can only be described as<br />\npre-coital depression.

Heavy<br />\nmetals drumers like Tommy Lee<br />\nof Motley Crue seem to delight<br />\nin projecting this bad boy \"Idon't-read-I-just-bang\" image.<br />\nLee focuses his audiences' attention on the visual excitement of<br />\nhis playing rather than on the<br />\nmusical skill behind his driving<br />\nstyle. Crue fans will recall that on<br />\nthe band's recent \"Girls, Girls,<br />\nGirls\" tour, Lee's drums were<br />\nturned upside down and suspended there as he did his solo. Of<br />\ncourse, visual flash has always<br />\nbeen a legitimate part of drumkit<br />\nplaying. Jazz great Jo Jones<br />\nmastered the technique of twirling his sticks while he played<br />\nfills. Rush's Neil Peart regularly<br />\nthrows a stick in the air during a<br />\nrest, timing his toss so that he catches the stick and comes down on<br />\na crash cymbal right on the start<br />\nof the beat. For one with such a<br />\nstrong and precise rock style,<br />\n<br />\nNeil Peart is modest and selfeffacing offstage\u2014a trait which<br />\nsurfaced in a recent \"Modern<br />\nDrummer\" magazine interview,<br />\nin which he virtually repudiated<br />\nthe praise of his fans in favor of<br />\nother musicians who have influenced him. Regardless, Mr.<br />\nPeart is thought by some to be the<br />\nmajor instrumental influence<br />\nwithin the trio. I once saw a diehard Rush fan shake his head<br />\nafter hearing \"YYZ\" and say<br />\nwith feeling, \"Neil Peart is<br />\nRush.\"<br />\nWhether or not this is true,<br />\nthere is no dissension on the fact<br />\nthat Peart makes brilliantly<br />\ncreative use of his bewilderingly<br />\nlarge drumkit, complete with<br />\nglockenspiel, gongs, bells and<br />\nelectronic percussion. Peart has<br />\nachieved the widest musical appreciation yet among popular audiences. Fans are listening to him<br />\ninstead of looking solely for<br />\nvisual flash. However, as Peart<br />\nwould unquestionably agree,<br />\nother drummers on the musical<br />\nscene deserve to be analyzed for<br />\ntheir musical expertise. Critical<br />\nappreciation relies on an<br />\nenlightened audience, free of the<br />\n<br />\nold myths of drummers' unsophistication and insensitivity to<br />\nmusical subtleties.<br />\nFusion drummer Danny Gottlieb has played with notable<br />\nmusicians John McLaughlin, Gil<br />\nEvens, Pat Metheny, and Al<br />\nDimeola (who appeared last<br />\nsemester in Shriver). Last year,<br />\n\"Acrecorded<br />\nGottlieb<br />\nquamarine\" (Atlantic Records),<br />\na diverse mixture of rock, Latin<br />\nand jazz styles played by an<br />\nequally diverse collection of<br />\nmusicians, such as McLaughlin,<br />\nEvens, John Abercrombie, Steve<br />\nKhan, and Dave Samuels. Fans of<br />\nGottlieb's heavy cymbal excursions during his stay in the<br />\nMahavishnu Orchestra and of his<br />\nmellow cymbal hues supporting<br />\nMel Lewis' Jazz ensemble will<br />\nfind his playing more precise and<br />\nsparse. Gottlieb explains: \"As<br />\nmy playing experience increases<br />\nand I mature as a musician, I'm<br />\ntrying to edit my playing so that<br />\neach beat, fill, and texture has<br />\nmeaning.\"(MD April 1988)<br />\nManu Katche is presently<br />\nrock's hottest drummer. Emerging out of a jazz/fusion<br />\nbackground, this Frenchmen<br />\n<br />\nlanded successive gigs with Peter<br />\nGabriel's \"So\" and Sting's<br />\n\"Nothing Like The Sun\" tours.<br />\nHis bright, colorful percussion is<br />\nmost popularly evident in the recent Top-40 hit \"Sledgehammer.\" Notice his lively yet<br />\nforceful hi-hat work. His finest<br />\nplaying on \"So\" is during \"In<br />\nYour Eyes,\" a haunting composition made exotic by Mr. Katche's<br />\ntom-tom patterns which blend into and reinforce Tony Levin's<br />\nwarm bass lines. Another fine<br />\ntrack is \"That Voice Again\"<br />\nfeaturing the same close interaction between tom-tom and bass<br />\ndrum patterns with Levin's aggressive melodic lines, along with<br />\na hypnotic hi-hat rythmn and explosive snare fills. Mr. Katch's<br />\ndrumming contributes to the<br />\nsong's dramatic mood.<br />\nKatche's playing on \"Nothing<br />\nLike The Sun\" is less aggressive,<br />\nusing more subtle cymbal patterns that blend into Sting's sequenced percussion tracks. The<br />\nbest drum performance is on<br />\n\"The Lazarus Heart.\" He plays<br />\na strong funk groove with bassist,<br />\nproviding a solid underpinning<br />\nover which Andy Summers lays<br />\n<br />\nhis open, airy guitar riffs.<br />\nis<br />\nfine<br />\ntrack<br />\nAnother<br />\n\"Englishman in New York.\"<br />\nAfter the initial reggae section,<br />\nthe band breaks into a hot jazz<br />\ngroove.

Nevertheless, certain artists<br />\nmanage to escape the net of<br />\nprofit-awareness, and take<br />\nmusical risks. Next time you<br />\nlisten to your favorite album, pick<br />\nout the drums.

They have succeeded in<br />\ncreating continuity and focus out<br />\nof chaos. They have even managed to make a funny play on paper<br />\nfunny on stage.<br />\nSkillful lighting provided a<br />\nfocus for the audience, as well as<br />\nestablishing the real from the<br />\nunreal. In one scene, Betty, while<br />\nbeing interogated, has a mental<br />\nimage of her old boss and her<br />\nsister. But due to the placement<br />\nand well laid out scenes, the<br />\ncharacters in her mind seem just<br />\nthat - in her mind. The two<br />\ncharacters on stage close in<br />\ntogether at center, and Betty's<br />\nmind fills up the empty space.<br />\nThe play is largely a mental play,<br />\ntaking place in the minds of<br />\ncharacters. The lighting gave it<br />\nthat vivid mental idea - very<br />\nbright resolution and not-quitedarkness for thoughts, contrasted<br />\nwith the more realistic lighting<br />\nfor the \"real\" scenes at the<br />\nbeginning and end.<br />\nAdept staging linked the lights to<br />\nthe drama. Rosalie's explaination<br />\nof her job (a \"flashback\" for<br />\nRosalie) just before she is killed<br />\nwas fantastic. The scene went<br />\nfrom the living room to Rosalie's<br />\nmind to the street without skipping a beat. It went from<br />\ntragicomic, listening to Betty and<br />\nRosalie talk about their loving<br />\nand exciting lives respectively, to<br />\n<br />\njust plain tragic (Rosalie is killed), to plain comic, as Jonathan<br />\nAbrahams, in one of his three<br />\nroles, comes out to rant and rave<br />\nabout his bike.<br />\nAnd let's talk about the actors.<br />\nMost notable, for my money, was<br />\nMary Kita as Rosalie.

At the other end of the<br />\nscale are the leaders of the movement for sexual freedom, who<br />\ndownplay the possibility of risk in<br />\nfavor of fulfillment of desire.<br />\nThe media has been forced to<br />\nsort through these conflicting<br />\nstories in its efforts to present<br />\n\"the AIDS story\" to the public.<br />\nDavid Schneiderman, former<br />\neditor-in-chief of the Village<br />\nVoice, gave the Frank R. Kent<br />\nMemorial Lecture on March 17.<br />\nHe said that in the early stages of<br />\nthe epidemic the Voice \"erred on<br />\nthe side of caution, trying not to<br />\nalarm our readers.\" He wished<br />\nthat there had been more press<br />\ncoverage sooner, because he<br />\nthought that greater exposure<br />\nwould have led to pressure on the<br />\ngovernment to allocate funds for<br />\nAIDS research. The first time the<br />\nAIDS virus hit the front page of<br />\nwidely influential publications<br />\nwas the July 1985 announcement<br />\nthat Rock Hudson was dying of<br />\n<br />\nAIDS.<br />\nAltogether, the epidemiologists, the proponents of sexual liberation, and the understandably cautious and confused<br />\nmedia have contributed to a<br />\n'massive tangle of information,<br />\nopinion,<br />\nmisinformation,<br />\nfanaticism, fear, and paranoia<br />\nthat all falls under the classification of \"the AIDS story.\"<br />\nThanks to Dr. Cone's invaluable<br />\nassistance, the following is about<br />\nthe closest thing there is to an accurate and moderate account of<br />\nAIDS in heterosexuals.<br />\nDr. Cone explained that there<br />\nis a possibility that the AIDS<br />\nvirus residing in its host white<br />\nblood cells is as infectious as the<br />\nfree virus. It is crucial to prevent<br />\ncontact between fluids that contain cells and one's own<br />\nbloodstream. This can be accomplished by avoiding sex that<br />\ncould break the skin, avoiding<br />\ncontact with cell fluids if there exist open sores, and not sharing<br />\nneedles. Exercise caution and use<br />\nprophylactics. Deep kissing is<br />\nalmost definitely safe, and so is<br />\noral sex if there is no contact with<br />\nthe bloodstream (like a mouth<br />\nulcer) because the virus is probably destroyed by acids in the<br />\nstomach. There are risks, and no<br />\none knows the odds, and so the<br />\n<br />\nquestion of how cautious to be<br />\neventually becomes a personal<br />\ndecision.<br />\nMasters and Johnson's point of<br />\nview is different. They say that<br />\nAIDS is \"running rampant in the<br />\nheterosexual community.\" Later<br />\nin the article, they cite their own<br />\npredictions of one woman in four<br />\nhundred encounters and one man<br />\nin six hundred encounters contracting AIDS. An editorial by<br />\nEllen Goodman, published in the<br />\nMarch 10 Baltimore Sun, quotes<br />\nDr. Masters' reason for using<br />\nsuch inflammatory language: \"I<br />\nsimply believe it.\"<br />\nAside from AIDS, Dr. Cone<br />\nsaid that there are other Sexually<br />\nTransmitted Disease (STDs)<br />\nwhich have fallen from prominence in the media, but not<br />\nfrom prominence in the population. According to Marilyn Gall,<br />\nClinic Nurse and Administrator<br />\nof the Health Clinic, the most<br />\ncommon STDs among Hopkins<br />\nstudents she's seen are chlamydia<br />\nand genital warts. While in men<br />\nchlamydia is a painful condition,<br />\nin women it can go unnoticed and<br />\neventually will cause infertility.<br />\nGenital warts are disfiguring and<br />\nincurable. Prophylactics are an<br />\nimportant preventative measure<br />\nnot just for AIDS, but for all<br />\nSTDs.<br />\n<br />\nSTUDY IN EUROPE<br />\n<br />\nThe University of Louvain (est. 1425), Leuven, Beigu!rn offers<br />\nComplete programmes in Philosophy for the<br />\ndegrees of BA., M.A., and Ph.D plus<br />\na junior year abroad programme<br />\nAll courses are in English<br />\neTtumition is 14.500 Belgium Franks( $250)<br />\nWrite<br />\nseuv<br />\nre,.ary English Programmes<br />\nKaroinaal Meraerplein 2,13.3000 Leuven, Belgium<br />\n<br />\n11.11111.1111111M\"<br />\n.<br />\n41111\".111111111<br />\n.<br />\n11MMI<br />\nHOURS<br />\n10-6 MON -SAT<br />\n<br />\nAIDS and the press:<br />\nWhich are we to believe<br />\n<br />\nK.U.

None of Hopkins'<br />\nthree victims-Washington College, Rutgers, and Princeton-are<br />\ntop-ten teams, while Washington<br />\nCollege belongs to Division III.<br />\nNonetheless, the Jays seem to<br />\nhave gained some sort of momentum in a season that started with<br />\nturmoil. A month before the<br />\nopener, star sophomore goalie<br />\nQuint Kessenich was suspended<br />\nfor one game by head coach Don<br />\nZimmerman. Kessenich and two<br />\nteammates, defensemen Dave<br />\nHowland and James DeTomasso,<br />\n<br />\nhad damaged furniture in the lobby of the Northway apartment<br />\nbuilding. A month later, immediately following the Syracuse<br />\nloss, attackman John Ciccarone<br />\nand midfielders John and Mark<br />\nDressel quit the team for what<br />\nthey said were personal reasons.<br />\nBoth Ciccarone and John Dressel<br />\nwere starters.<br />\nNonetheless, Hopkins traditionally performs better in the second half of the season. Coach<br />\nZimmerman expects the team to<br />\nprogress with each week. If this<br />\nhappens, the Blue Jays just may<br />\nhave a chance against the best<br />\nteams in the nation, whom they<br />\nencounter starting tomorrow<br />\nwhen they travel to Charlottesville to take on the University<br />\nof Virginia.<br />\nThe question on everyone's<br />\nmind will be whether the Hopkins<br />\noffense can score enough goals to<br />\nkeep up with its stellar defense.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1987, the Jays lost to graduation super scorers Craig Bubier<br />\nand Brian Wood. This season, top<br />\ngun Mike Morrill remains, but<br />\nwill his attack-entourage prove<br />\npotent enough to outscore the<br />\nlikes of Virginia, North Carolina,<br />\nand Maryland, whom Hopkins<br />\nwill face in three of the next four<br />\nweeks?<br />\nJunior Jeff Ihm and sophomore<br />\nScott Marr have replaced Bubier<br />\nand Ciccarone, and have combined for 10 goals and 5 assists in<br />\nfour games. Marr looked particularly impressive against<br />\nPrinceton, recording three goals<br />\nand an assist. Morrill, meanwhile, has 7 goals and 3 assists.<br />\nBut the most promising cog in<br />\nthe Hopkins attack has to be<br />\nfreshman Matt Panetta, who has<br />\nregistered 5 goals and 2 assists,<br />\nand has scored in each of the<br />\nSee LAX, 26<br />\n<br />\n\"The oldest<br />\n<br />\nnation\"<br />\n\"Every college playing lacrosse, regardless of its division is condidered\"<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n8<br />\n9<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\nSyracuse (5)<br />\nMaryland (1)<br />\nNorth Carolina<br />\nVirginia<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nLoyola<br />\nBrown<br />\nHarvard<br />\nCornell<br />\nTowson St.<br />\n<br />\nRecord<br />\n5-0<br />\n4-0<br />\n5-1<br />\n5-0<br />\n3-1<br />\n6-0<br />\n3-1<br />\n4-0<br />\n2-2<br />\n5-1<br />\n<br />\nPts<br />\n59<br />\n55<br />\n47<br />\n43<br />\n36<br />\n28<br />\n151/2<br />\n13<br />\n11<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n(First place votes in parentheses)<br />\nOthers receiving votes: C.W.

We're a strong<br />\nteam, we'll have to take it one<br />\ngame at a time.\" The setbacks in<br />\ngoal revolve around the knee injury of senior goalie Laura Porter<br />\nand the recent illness of freshman<br />\nkeeper Dawn Nee. Both<br />\ngoalkeepers will be out for the<br />\nduration of the season.<br />\nWith Wednesday night's victory over cross-town rival<br />\nGoucher College, a tough loss to<br />\nRoanoke in a game plagued by<br />\nrain, hail, and delay, and wins<br />\nover Washington College and<br />\nSwarthmore, the Lady Jays have<br />\ncompiled a 3-1 record. This<br />\nyear's team is dominated by experience in that no starters were<br />\nlost to graduation. Returning for<br />\nanother season at Homewood are<br />\nAll-Americans Heather Klink<br />\n(co-leader in assists) and Alice<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCollins (scoring leader); seniors<br />\nJen Stahl, Liz Davis, Erika<br />\nFeller, Kacie White, Laura<br />\nPorter, and Maggie Schmidt;<br />\njunior Kathy Hart, and<br />\nsophomores Julie Siegrist, Carrie<br />\nAllalemdjian, and Patty Lagator<br />\n(co-leader in assists). Joining the<br />\nteam this spring are freshmen<br />\nKara Tipton, Kristin Cole, Cathy<br />\nMoskel, Jen Chun, Kathy Herring, Dawn Nee, and Tara Fram.<br />\nLagator feels that,\"we have a lot<br />\nof talent on this team. The<br />\nfreshmen look good, and hopefully we will maintain the skill level<br />\nwe had last year and continue to<br />\nbetter ourselves.\" Last season<br />\nHopkins compiled a record of<br />\n10-3 and won the Maryland College Tournament.<br />\nIn Wednesday night's wide<br />\nmargin win over Goucher College 22-3, Hopkins displayed<br />\nquickness and an accurate passing game that was too much for<br />\nthe slower Gophers to keep up<br />\nwith, much less shut down. Top<br />\nscorers in that game were<br />\nSchmidt with 1 goal and 5 assists,<br />\nLagator with 5 goals, and Tipton,<br />\n<br />\nScrambling for<br />\n<br />\nCollins, and Moskel with four<br />\npoints apiece. Strong defensive<br />\nplay by Siegrist, Stahl, Davis,<br />\nAllalemdjian, and Feller, and a<br />\ngood effort by Cole in the net<br />\nresulted in allowing only three<br />\nGopher goals. Cole, a freshman<br />\nfrom Chichester, PA, appeared in<br />\ngoal for her first time ever. Said<br />\nco-captain Davis, \"Kristin is a<br />\ngreat player on the field, but she's<br />\nonly been in goal one practice.<br />\nShe's being a good sport because<br />\nthe team needs her.\" Cole is<br />\nusually a defenseman. The offense did a good job of keeping<br />\nthe ball upfield and away from<br />\ntheir own net with good efforts by<br />\nHart and co-captain Klink, and<br />\nquick accurate passing from<br />\nSchmidt to Lagator, as well as<br />\ncontributions from Collins, Tipton, and Moskel.<br />\nConsidering the Lady Jays problems in goal coupled with a<br />\nrigorous travelling schedule, the<br />\nteam looks good and according to<br />\nDavis, \"we've really pulled<br />\ntogether,\" and as Klink adds,<br />\n\"are bouncing back.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\ns tickets?<br />\n<br />\n3-for-3 (1.000) career batting<br />\nby P.

Hopkins placed<br />\nfifth out of seventeen teams in a<br />\ngrueling, five-hour, full course<br />\ncompetition with a score of 3965<br />\nout of a possible 4800.<br />\nThis was Hopkins' best score<br />\nof the season, and Coach Hardy<br />\nwas pleased with the results.<br />\n\"When you go into a match, all<br />\nyou can ask for is to shoot your<br />\nbest. Each shooter is in competition with himself, and if you<br />\nshoot your best score, the match<br />\nis a success.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe match was the only full<br />\ncourse (120 record shots, 40 in<br />\neach position of prone, kneeling,<br />\nand standing, as opposed to the<br />\nusual 60 shot half course) that<br />\nHopkins fired this season. Taking<br />\nseveral hours to complete, the full<br />\ncourse is a test of endurance as<br />\nwell as consistency and deadly accuracy over time. The most difficult part of the full course is the<br />\neighty minute standing position.<br />\nTo be competitive here the<br />\nshooter must prove strong and<br />\nsteady enough to hold his unsupported, thirteen pound rifle for<br />\nover an hour while consistently<br />\ndelivering forty .22 caliber projectiles fifty feet away to an area<br />\nthe size of an aspirin.<br />\n<br />\nSophomore sharpshooter Jim<br />\n\"I just can't miss\" Kielkopf led<br />\nthe Hopkins riflemen in scoring<br />\nwith his personal record of 1059<br />\nout of 1200.

Senior Adam<br />\nKristol wrapped up a successful<br />\ncollege career with a healthy 994,<br />\nbut team captain Neil Seidman<br />\nchoked in the standing position<br />\nand finished below his expected<br />\nability. Also firing in the sec-<br />\n<br />\ntionals in the individual competitions were sophomore Larry<br />\nYoung and freshman Matt<br />\nFischer.<br />\n1987-88 has been one of the<br />\nmost successful seasons in recent<br />\nyears for Hopkins. The Blue Jays<br />\nimproved their match average<br />\nscores by 131 points over last<br />\nseason, making Hopkins the most<br />\nimproved team in the league. This<br />\nfurnished the team with victories<br />\nover Yale, Princeton, Rider, and<br />\nPenn State Delco but was not<br />\nenough to defeat the nowerful<br />\n<br />\nscholarship teams of St. John's,<br />\nPenn State Main, Army, and<br />\nNavy.<br />\nIn addition to Adam Kristol,<br />\nthe two other seniors that will be<br />\nlost to graduation are Brian Kurtz<br />\nand John Cieslowski. Despite<br />\nthese losses,junior Neil Seidman<br />\nis optimistic that the team will be<br />\neven stronger next year. \"We<br />\nhave a lot of talent to improve on<br />\nthat will still be around for one<br />\nor two years; our best shots have<br />\ntwo years left.

Senior<br />\nCindy Harper (Philadelphia, PA)<br />\nbecame only the second player in<br />\nHopkins history to score 1000<br />\npoints in a career.<br />\nThe Hopkins offensive punch<br />\nwas supplied by the freshman<br />\nclass. Kristi Kantowski (Ellicott<br />\nCity, MD) led the Blue Jays in<br />\nscoring, averaging fourteen<br />\npoints per game. Jennifer Luzietti<br />\n(Shelton, CT)finished the season<br />\nwith a 10.6 ppg average, and<br />\nJulianne Rolapp (Darnestwon,<br />\nMD) was the 3rd highest scorer<br />\nwith a 9.6 per game average.<br />\nRolapp led the team in three point<br />\nshots, scoring on 41 percent of<br />\nher shots from beyond the 19 foot<br />\n<br />\n9 inch arc.<br />\nIn the rebounding department,<br />\nJennifer Luzietti led Hopkins with<br />\n6.8 rebounds per game.

If Seiler's were catering in the Glass Pavilion, for example, the<br />\nRat cannot be used because food must be<br />\nbrought through it.

Our task is to get a consensus on<br />\ncampus on how these concerns should be<br />\naddressed and what the program should<br />\nlook like.<br />\n\"The task of the next Dean is to pick up<br />\nthe momentum begun by Dean Welch in<br />\norder to bring this issue toward an actionoriented closure somtime within the next<br />\nacademic year,\" he concluded.<br />\nWhile students, faculty, administrators,<br />\nand alumni agree that the problem of<br />\nlimited space and the need for more interaction must be addressed, reaching a<br />\nconsensus on exactly how this agreement<br />\nshould be reached is difficult.<br />\nAccording to Lombardi, Hopkins' small<br />\nand specialized student population, as well<br />\nas the University's unique historical<br />\nbackground as an all-male, graduate<br />\nschool, creates particular concerns.<br />\n\"At Hopkins, there hasn't been an entirely<br />\ntypical<br />\ndevelopment<br />\nof<br />\nundergraduate student life,\" he said.<br /><br />\n\"We're unordinary, and we're organized<br />\nto be that way. This, I feel, is not a defect<br />\nbut a virtue. However, Hopkins' special<br />\nstudent body and history make it hard to<br />\nfind an appropriate external guide to extracurricular support for us to follow.\"<br />\nPresent facilities, he explained, were<br />\ndesigned to be \"generic\" in order to meet<br />\nthe changing needs of a small student body.<br />\n\"The Arellano Theatre, for example, was<br />\ntailored to be generic,\" he said. \"This<br />\ngeneration may see it as a theater, the next<br />\nmay perhaps see it as a debate hall. It can<br />\nbe accommodated to serve changing functions. Naturally, you could also say that<br />\nit doesn't do anything exactly right.\"<br />\nProviding additional space, said Lombardi, should be less of an issue than the<br />\nenhancing of student activity.<br />\n\"The way students need to think of it is<br />\nessentially as a trade-off between money<br />\nwhich could be spent for student activities<br />\nand money which will have to be spent for<br />\nthe upkeep of an actual facility,\" he said.<br />\n\"Students should spend their time and<br />\nenergy on what they want to do, and work<br />\nfrom there on the facilities.\"<br />\nA new union, both Lombardi and Welch<br />\nestimated, would take at least five years<br />\nto complete. The process includes a needs<br /><br />\nassessment and feasibility study, an architectural study, a fund-raising campaign,<br />\nand the actual construction, provided that<br />\nall parties involved can agree on what<br />\nshould be done.<br />\n\"I don't know if we need an actual<br />\nbuilding,\" said Lombardi. \"I'm not<br />\nprepared to say that the first priority to<br />\nstudents should be bricks and mortar. What<br />\nstudents need to do is DO\u2014and get the<br />\nmaximum benefit from their time here.\"<br />\nThe administration, according to Lombardi, regards the quality of student life in<br />\nterms of three issues: housing, athletic<br />\nfacilities, and a union. Housing, he said,<br />\ntakes priority over the second two, but<br />\nathletic facilities and a union are of equal<br />\nimportance. In addition, \"there are the soft<br />\nquestions of programming and support.<br />\n\"Quality of student life is one of the administration's top two priorities for the<br />\nHomewood campus, along with financial<br />\nstability,\" continued Lombardi. \"The<br />\nschool of Arts and Sciences must be financially stable so that the academic quality<br />\nof Hopkins is preserved\u2014that's first. The<br />\nnext highest priority is to bring student life<br />\nup to a level competitive with other firstclass undergraduate institutions.<br /><br />\nSUMMER<br />\nPROGRAM<br />\nIN<br />\nITALY<br />\nMake your summer vacation this year an adventure to<br />\nremember.

The resolution<br />\nreflects the concern that with the<br />\nadministrative dean reporting to<br />\nthe academic deans, and with no<br />\n\"independent revenue source,\"<br />\nstudent services might be sacrificed to the needs of the academic<br />\nschools.<br />\nStudent Council President Scott<br />\nFitzGerald said, \"I'm not comfortable with the way things are.<br />\nCurrently Welch reports to the<br />\nacademic deans for financial approval, but [under this new plan]<br />\nhis replacement has got to go to<br />\nthe academic deans for<br />\neverything.\"<br />\n\"In my mind,\" he continued,<br />\n\"the replacement has to have a lot<br />\nmore power.\"<br />\nStudent Council Vice President<br />\nStephanie Weissman underscored<br />\nthe significance of the independent revenue line. \"The idea of<br />\nthe direct line of revenue for the<br />\ndean of student services is the<br />\nmost important point, \"she said.<br />\n\"The academic deans should not<br />\nhave resource to money intended<br />\nfor student services.<br />\nUnder the present system,<br />\nfunds for student services are<br />\nallocated by the academic deans.<br />\nOnce these funds are allocated,<br />\nWelch decides to which areas<br />\nthey are to be applied, subject to<br />\nprovost and president approval.<br />\nThe Council resolution calls for<br />\na set yearly amount, perhaps as<br />\na percentage of tuition, to be appropriated for student services.<br />\nFitzGerald and Weissman<br />\npresented the Council resolutions<br />\nto Muller in a meeting Tuesday.<br />\nAt the regular SC meeting<br /><br />\nWednesday, FitzGerald brought<br />\nforward some of the points raised at the meeting.<br />\nAccording to FitzGerald,<br />\nMuller wants to meet with a<br />\nlarger group of selected<br />\nundergraduates to discuss and explain the background of the<br />\ndecision.<br />\nIn particular, Muller said that<br />\nWelch's position was created<br />\nthree years ago against the will of<br />\nthe academic deans. The new administration plan creates a position in which the academic deans<br />\nbelieve. Such belief is necessary<br />\nfor smooth interaction over such<br />\ndual areas as the registrar, financial aid and admissions.<br />\nFitzGerald said that Muller<br />\n\"intimated that the plan is sort of<br />\non a trial basis for a year. If it<br />\ndoesn't work, then they will try<br />\nsomething else. . . .He has pledged to watch over this situation<br />\nwith hawk eyes.\"<br />\nWeissman added that Muller<br />\n\"did refute our 'revenue argument. Assuming we did set aside<br />\na percentage of tuition, it would<br />\nbe the same as arguing over<br />\nbudgets each year, since as tuition<br />\nis raised the percentage amount<br />\ngets larger, there would be a fight<br />\nevery year over the amount.\"<br />\nFitzGerald concluded, \"I don't<br />\nagree with the premise, but I do<br />\nagree that the plan is well thought<br />\nout with good substantial<br />\nreasons.\"<br />\nHe added, \"I don't agree with<br />\nthe proposition; but I don't see<br />\nthat there is anything we can<br />\ndo. . . but raise hell if things are<br />\nnot going well next year during<br />\nthe trial period.

Interfraternity Council President<br /><br />\nSteven Basta said, \"I don't think<br />\n[the Student Council Resolution]<br />\ngoes far enough.

But wait\u2014they're all<br />\njust leaving for the weekend.<br />\nThis weekend is a religious one for many<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community. Christians<br />\nwill be celebrating Easter this Sunday; for Jews,<br />\nthis evening marks the beginning of Passover.<br />\nWhile these holidays are not as commercially<br />\npopular as their December counterparts, they<br />\nare certainly just as religiously important, if not<br />\nmore so. However, never has any vacation time<br />\nbeen given so that students and faculty who<br />\nwish to celebrate these holidays may do so.<br />\nThose who wish to spend the holidays with<br />\nfamily are forced into planning exceedingly<br />\nshort trips; others live too far from Baltimore<br />\nto make such a short trip feasible.<br />\nThe campus religious groups have special<br />\nholiday services and meals planned;<br />\nnonetheless, there is still something nicer about<br />\nbeing able to spend important holidays like<br />\nthese with family.<br />\nGranted, Hopkins is not a religiuosly oriented<br />\ninstitution. Still, there is no reason why some<br /><br />\nrecognition cannot be given to this weekend's<br />\nholidays. Even the Baltimore County public<br />\nschools are off today and Monday.<br />\nEaster and Passover don't fall on the same<br />\nweekend every year, so administrators might<br />\nbe reluctant to begin providing vacations for<br />\nthe holidays. But seniors will recall that the<br />\nsame thing happened three years ago.

But we<br />\nurge those who plan it to be sensitive to the<br />\nEaster and Passover calendar dates, and consider a small vacation for this important<br />\nweekend when it occurs again. There are many<br />\namong us who consider these holidays to be an<br />\nimportant part of their religious and cultural<br />\nheritage, and it is sad to think that our academic<br />\ndevelopment must always take place at the expense of the other two.<br /><br />\nA Little Leeway<br />\nChance Meetings<br />\nby A.

One of the<br />\nmore traumatic childhood experiences which made me what I<br />\nam today involved my pursuit of<br />\na \"friend\" through the streets of<br />\nEast Greenwich. I'll never forget<br />\nthe \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" horror which filled my being as he turned and said, \"I'm<br />\nnot Charlie.\"<br />\nLast week, I went out to dinner with my brother and his<br />\nfiance. Half way through my sole<br />\nflorentine, a middle-age woman<br />\napproached our table. \"Excuse<br />\nme,\" she said to Asa, \"but aren't<br />\nyou George? You went to<br />\nAssumption with my son Danny.\"<br />\n\"No,\" Asa replied, \"sorry.\"<br />\nI didn't miss my chance to break<br />\nin.<br />\n\"Don't lie to the poor woman,<br />\nGeorge,\" I said to Asa. \"You're<br />\nsuch a joker. That's what Danny<br />\nalways liked about you.\" The<br />\nwoman eyed him for a moment,<br />\nthen glanced back at me. I didn't<br />\nmiss a beat. \"You always tell me<br />\nabout the one you put over on<br />\nDanny when you guys were in<br />\nBoston. Did he ever tell you<br />\nthat?\u2014 Meanwhile, Asa mumbled, \"No, shut up, shut up.\" At<br />\nlast, she retired to augment her<br />\nconfusion with another martini,<br />\nleaving our table to recount all<br /><br />\nour Great Mistaken Identity<br />\nanecdotes.<br />\nAsa spoke first. During his<br />\nsophomore year, he had gone out<br />\none night with a few of his buddies. They were a racous bunch,<br />\nbarely able to squeeze into two<br />\ncars. By the time they left the bar,<br />\nthey were all feeling a bit impish.<br />\nAt a stop light, his friends in the<br />\nfirst car leapt out of their respective doors, and jumped against<br />\nthe windows of the second car,<br />\nsending its occupants(Asa included) into a frightened tizzy. The<br />\nraiders piled back into their car,<br />\nand Asa stewed until the next<br />\nlight. There, the Man With A<br />\nMission threw open his door, ran<br />\nbroken-field through the traffic,<br />\nand jumped onto his quarry's<br />\nroof. He thrust his head into the<br />\nsunroof and emitted a primal<br />\nscream which shook the<br />\nstreetlights. Only after the guttural roar died in his throat did he<br />\nrealize that his friend's car didn't<br />\nhave a sunroof, and that he was<br />\nnot staring down at a bunch of<br />\nstultified college chums, but at six<br />\nvery unappreciative men with a<br />\nfondness for black leather, tatoos,<br />\nand chains. A sprint earned in<br />\nmany hours of after-school practice brought him safely back to<br />\nthe car, but it was his bad luck to<br />\nhave his friend Tom, a stoic German, at the wheel. \"I will not<br />\ngo,\" he told Asa, \"the light is<br />\nred.\" Only after the equation<br />\n\"swinging chains +sheet metal<br />\nequals body shop\" became clear<br />\ndid Tom forget his Old World<br />\nsensibilties and lay down some<br />\ntracks.<br />\nMy grandfather then chipped in<br /><br />\nSee LEEWAY, 11<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nEditors<br />\nJulie Levine, Flory Ware<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

By the<br />\ntime we had finished our bird'snest and pot of tea, my watch read<br />\n1 a.m. It was cold, but I had on<br />\na long, somber overcoat which<br />\nprotected me from the biting<br />\nwind. As we left the restaurant,<br />\nsomething in a window display<br />\ncaught my eye and Lisa walked<br />\na few steps ahead of me. When<br />\nI again ambled on along the<br /><br />\nsidewalk, I saw her reach out to<br />\ntake the arm of a man walking<br />\njust in front of her, a man in a<br />\nlong black overcoat, with dark<br />\nhair like my own, standing within<br />\nan inch or two of my own height.<br />\nFirst, she tried to hook her arm<br />\nthrough his. This he shrugged off<br />\nwith a twist at the waist. Next,<br />\nshe grabbed for his elbow. Again,<br />\nhe evaded seizure. Visibly exasperated at her \"fiance's'. unorthodox behavior, Lisa at first<br />\nmade a move for the hand in the<br />\npocket, but then, throwing subtlety to the wind, grasped his elbow<br />\nand pulled, twisting the man<br />\ntowards her. Certain that he was<br />\nbeing accosted, the man gave a<br />\nlittle yelp. Lisa didn't say a word,<br />\njust petrified on the spot.

He began<br />\nby cautioning, \"Oh, Muller was fine. He<br />\nalways seemed to have time to come down<br />\nto Florida to shoot and never bitched<br />\nabout longing for Baltimore. He was just<br />\na victim of circumstances.\"<br />\nScheduled to play Tammy Faye Bakker<br />\nhad been singer Cyndi Lauper. \"We got<br />\nthrough most of the shooting with her, but<br />\nshe lost her popularity, you know,\"said<br />\nWaters. \"Furthermore, she hired Joyce<br />\nBrown, the homeless woman who refused<br />\ntreatment in New York, as her costume<br />\ndesigner, and while it's nice picturing<br />\nTammy Faye wearing soda cans, it didn't<br />\nfit the image.\"<br />\nLauder was subsequently dropped from<br />\nthe cast. \"We tried others, \"said Waters.<br />\n\"But once we thought we had Phyllis<br />\nDiller, she re-did her face and now looks<br />\nlike Queen Elizabeth, so we gave up.\"<br />\nThe second major role, that of Jim Bakker, was to have been filled by Bronson<br />\nPinchot of ABC's Perfect Strangers.<br />\nWaters explained that Pinchot had the<br />\nhumor for the part, but not the muscle.<br />\n\"You see, he got too caught up in his<br />\nTV role, \" said Waters. \"When ABC<br />\ndecided to move Perfect Strangers to Friday night, Bronson took it all too literally<br />\nand wrenched his back. So we dropped<br />\nJim Bakker him.\"<br />\nWaters continued,\"We then tried to in\"Oh please, please let me play Jimmy Swaggart. I beg you, I am experienced at this, so ject some realism by hiring Jim Bakker to<br />\nplease, please have mercy on me.\"<br />\nplay himself. That was fine until we got<br /><br />\nto the sex scenes. Bakker was uncooperative, neglecting the script and insisting on performing the scenes the way<br />\nthey really happened.<br />\n\"Well, as you can imagine, the mannequin that we used as Jessica Hahn couldn't<br />\nstand up to the torture, \"said Waters. \"So<br />\nwe dropped the part from the script.\"<br />\nThe other major player to go was Robin<br />\nWilliams, who was hired to play Jerry<br />\nFalwell.<br />\n\"Robin was fine,'said Waters, \"unti!<br />\nhe got the opportunity to play Adrian<br />\nCronauer in Good Morning, Vietnam. That<br />\nleft us without a Falwell, so we hired Ed<br />\nMeese, the attorney general.\"<br />\nMeese, however, slowed the schedule.<br />\n''He kept taking all the extras out to the<br />\nbars with money he got from who-knowswhere, \" said Waters. \"He certainly<br />\nwasn't earning enough from us or his job<br />\nas attorney general to have that kind of<br />\nmoney. So we dropped him from the<br />\ncast.\"<br />\nThat left Muller as the only principal.<br />\nWaters then decided to change the movie<br />\ninto a running account of Swaggart's sermons. Since the film was already $5<br />\nmillion over budget, Waters could not hire<br />\nreal people for the sermon audiences,<br />\nso he hired the Smurfs.<br />\n\"Yes, I know they're blue,\" he said.<br />\n\"But they didn't talk back, and we figured<br />\nthat we could play with some color filters<br />\nuntil they were of body color.\"<br />\nThe film wrapped in January, before the<br />\nSwaggart sex scandal surfaced. Waters explained that he and the studio threw up<br />\ntheir hands in disgust following Swaggart's<br />\ntelevised confession of sin.<br />\n\"As you might expect, we had to change<br />\nthe cast again, \" said Waters. \"We<br />\nbrought in Samantha Fox from England to<br />\nplay the prostitute. We've been giving her<br />\nvoice-coaching lessons to get rid of her<br />\nBritish accent. She's a slow learner, but<br />\nI like working with her, as does everyone<br />\nelse.<br /><br />\nJerry Falwell<br /><br />\nMuller can stop practicing now.<br /><br />\n\"At this point, Muller became our probkm,,\" continued Waters. \"You see, we<br />\nneeded a novice at sex for maximum effect, but Muller had forty years of experience at this, so when we put him in bed<br />\nwith Sam, he had all the right moves. She<br />\nbrought out the animal in him. \u2014<br />\nA replacement for Muller had not been<br />\nfound.

Thank you.\" Nader then sat down.<br />\nMohyuddin then opened the floor for questions. \"Any<br />\nquestions?\" he asked the bewildered audience.<br />\n\"Yes,\"said Spring Fair Chairperson Jonathan Siegel.<br />\n\"Mr. Nader, we all know Hopkins has a reputation for<br />\nbeing a throat school, not a party school. How can you<br />\nsay we have a reputation as a party school?\"<br />\nNader responded, \"Well, you know, lacrosse parties,<br />\nbeach parties, small parties, I mean parties are healthy,<br />\nbut some students don't mix parties\u2018vith their work, and<br />\nthat's unhealthy. College students should find a bright mix<br />\nof work and parties to make their experiences better.\"<br />\nMohyuddin chimed in,\"A very perceptive statement,<br />\nand one that should make everyone, feel good about<br />\nthemselves. Any more uplifting questions? Lloyd?\"<br /><br />\nLloyd Armstrong, Jr., dean of the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences, rose. \"Mr. Nader,\"he said, \"my school is<br />\nfighting a budget deficit that will surely impact upon<br />\nundergraduate education, but the University won't finance<br />\nit. Doesn't that bode ill for undergraduate education here?\"<br />\nNader thought. \"It's certainly a serious problem, but<br />\nI assure you the University will find some way to eliminate<br />\nthe deficit without affecting the undergraduates, or even<br />\nthe ability to attract professors and research grants.\"<br />\nMohyuddin cut in, \"Oh glory, glory! A University of<br />\nlove! Now, I have to leave, but I will turn over the podium<br />\nto my wonderful assistant, Joy Starlight. Any more uplifting questions? Fit-?' Mohyuddin then left.<br />\n\"Thank you,\" said Student Council President FitzGerald. \"I'm losing control. What do I do?\"<br />\nNader responded, \"Take two aspirin, eat an apple a<br />\nday, and be happy.\"<br />\nStarlight broke up. \"Here you have a man who is not<br />\nonly intelligent but unbearably funny. This is too much.<br />\nI've got to control myself.\" She ran out of the room.<br />\nSomeone spoke. \"Mr. Nader, I am Hoppy the Rubber<br />\nChicken, mascot of The Black and Blue Jay,\"said an<br />\nidiot dressed in a chicken suit. \"How does the tailwagging of the Corvair impact upon our $11,000 tuition?\"<br />\nNader sprung to life. \"The Corvair! Don't make me<br />\ntalk about the Corvair! I'm sick of it\u2014it's a dead issue,<br />\nand I like talking about things that are alive.\"<br />\nStarlight returned. \"Well, it's nice to see that even in<br />\nmy absence, people are talking about things alive and<br />\nbright. That's what makes Lyceum so special. Any more<br />\nquestions?\" Pause. \"Seeing none, I'd like to thank Ralph<br />\nNader for his perceptive, interesting, and provocative<br />\nspeech. Let's applaud to show our appreciation.\"<br />\nAfter the meeting, Nader approached University Presi-<br /><br />\ndent Steven Muller, who attended the lecture.<br />\n\"Very nice, very nice,\"said Muller. \"You were an<br />\ninspiration to everyone.\"<br />\n\"Fine, fine, \"said Nader, quickly. \"I just want to work<br />\nout the details of my payment.\"<br />\n\"No problem, \"said Muller. \"You did a good job for<br />\nus.

Headache<br /><br />\n7576649403447<br /><br />\nThere are so many problems here. We<br />\nhave so little housing; our athletic facilities<br />\nare so poor; the School of Arts and Sciences<br />\nis shrinking and will probably stay in the<br />\nred for a good period of time; non-academic<br />\nconcerns are threatened to extinction with<br />\nthe subordination of a director of student<br />\nservices; we lack a sense of community<br />\nwhich breeds apathy and intolerance between sexes, races and segments of<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nBut gosh, it's no one's fault, really, and<br />\nthe University is trying very hard to address<br />\nall of those problems. Our school has<br />\nalways shown the degree of prudence and<br />\ninsight necessary to appropriately restructure administrative organization so as to<br />\nbenefit the community.<br />\nHistory has had students manifest varying degrees of concern for the issues confronting a university. The administration is<br /><br />\nsentient to the fact that students are currently demanding involvement and solutions for<br />\nthe problems facing us. With such<br />\nunderstanding of this and it offers a great<br />\ndeal of perspective, we expect that plans<br />\nsoon emerge and concretize that<br />\nwill<br />\n_<br />\nwill put Homewood on the corrective path.<br />\nThere can be no overstating the importance for students to appreciate the administration's efforts\u2014and understand the<br />\nlimitations of this University with regards<br />\nto fiscal matters and structure. Tangential<br />\nproblems such as tenure policy and declaring Gilman Hall a landmark reverberate<br />\nrepercussions through major issues.<br />\nAll of this boils down to a pledge of<br />\nmoderation on everyone's part. It is incumbent on each of us to let our opinions be<br />\nheard, and listen to the response. It may<br />\nnot always be to our liking\u2014but certainly<br />\nit will contribute to our communal benefit.<br /><br />\nE ()maniacs<br />\nCute Colombo<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI was appalled at the sadistic attempt of humor that James<br />\nRosen's With Eyes Closed cartoon contained in the Feb. 12th<br />\nissue. I know and accept the fact<br />\nthat for years now Goucher College has been considered a<br />\nplaypen by many Hopkins<br />\nstudents. Most Hopkins men feel<br />\nthat Goucher students are prewed, or are just here for their<br />\nMrs. degree. They also believe<br />\nthat we all melt at advances from<br />\nfuture doctors or deans. Although<br />\nI, and many of my friends, do<br />\nfind Dean Colombo cute in a teddy bear sort of way, it would take<br />\nmore than just a condom for him<br />\nto get to know me better.

It seems that every<br />\nother letter uses this page to say<br />\nthings that don't belong here. For<br />\nexample, candidates in the last<br />\nfew elections have acknowledged their candidacies here, told of<br />\ntheir stance on school issues,<br />\nbrown nosed the N-L on a job<br />\nwell done, and then gone on to<br />\nsay that they won't use this page<br />\nto talk about the election. I mean,<br />\ncome on. I am running for SC<br />\nPrez next year, and if! win I will<br />\ngive each of my voters $5, but I<br />\nwon't use this space to talk about<br />\nit. Instead call me collect some<br />\ntime and we'll talk.<br />\nEven better, some school<br />\ngroups think that this is campus<br />\nnuts. It is not. I don't care when<br />\nyour next meeting is, and if! did<br />\nI would read about it on the back<br />\npage. I probably can't make it<br />\nthough, as The Pornography Club<br />\nwill be having a meeting Monday<br /><br />\nor Fairy Tale Theatre<br />\nIt must be difficult for you, my<br />\nfaithful readers, having to sit idly by and watch my works of<br />\nliterary wonder being turned into trash by the master editors,<br />\nBrad and Liz. Just last week, this<br />\nconniving pair elected to cut four<br />\nwords from my article! FOUR<br />\nWORDS!!!<br />\nBut\u2014since I am so great, so<br />\nfunny, and so well-liked by all of<br />\nyou (yesterday I was mauled by<br />\nthree beautiful blondes screaming, \"Oh Bruce!

The album firmly established Lunkhead as a musical<br />\nforce to be reckoned with, but<br />\ncuts like \"Pepperoni and Nitro\"<br />\n(which went to No. 3 on the<br />\nEuropean charts) indicated that<br />\nsongwriter and lead vocalist<br />\nDieter Grossenschwanz still had<br />\nsome room for improvement.<br />\nOn their latest album, Slugfest,<br />\nthe Lunkers demonstrate a new-<br /><br />\nfound musical sensibility that<br />\nmight finally win them some attention in the States. The album<br />\ncenters around an annual festival<br />\nheld in Lunkhead's hometown of<br />\nMiezen, located in Southern<br />\nBavaria. The festival originally<br />\nbegan as a celebration by the survivors of the Black Plague, but<br />\nwhen it was time to gather up the<br />\nfood for the festival, it was<br />\ndiscovered that everything had<br />\ndied or been killed. The only<br />\nthing left were some slugs that<br />\nhad crawled into the local<br />\nbrewery in search of some<br />\nbeer\u2014and Slugfest was born. According to the liner notes, some<br />\neffort has been made in recent<br />\nyears to abolish the festival, but<br />\ncommunity leaders have kept it<br />\non as a link to the past. Where<br />\nLunkhead comes down on this<br />\nissue is unclear, but the festival<br />\nseems to have inspired them to<br />\ntheir best album yet. The first<br />\nsingle, \"Slimy Trails,\" is a surprisingly evocative ballad that<br />\nfeatures guitarist Erik von Stenz<br />\non twelve string, and a wailing<br />\nalto sax doing background fills\u2014<br />\nquite a departure from the crunching guitar of their earlier album<br />\nand songs like \"Fuel-Injected<br />\nDeath Machine.\" Have no fear<br />\nthat Lunkhead has sold out,<br />\nhowever, because there's enough<br />\nof the old blazing axe-work on<br />\nhere to satisfy even the most diehard fans. Their next single from<br />\nthe album is entitled \"Salt Shaker<br /><br />\nfrom Hell,\" and it promises to<br />\nmelt your stereo speakers into a<br />\nblack and woodgrain mess<br />\n(rumour has it that drummer<br />\nRollo Rotz destroyed his drupkit<br />\nduring the initial recording sessions, and that taping was held off<br />\nfor several weeks while his body<br />\nwas allowed to heal from the flying splinters of metal. Heavy<br />\nmetal is right!) My personal<br />\nfavorite, however, would have to<br />\nbe \"Beer in the Garden,\" which<br />\nmanages to talk about the lure and<br />\ndanger of overindulgence,<br />\nwithout resorting to being<br />\npreachy. \"There's always beer in<br />\nthe garden for you/go ahead.<br />\nhave a drink or two/What're you<br />\nwaiting for/'fraid your body'll<br />\nwash up on the shore?\" Such<br />\ncrisp and expressive lyricism<br />\ncharacterizes Slugfest, and,<br />\nhopefully, is indicative of more<br />\ngreat things to come from<br />\nLunkhead.<br /><br />\nTHE CONCERT<br />\nLast Thursday, I had a chance<br />\nto see one of the greatest mostly<br />\nliving rock and roll bands ever.<br />\nThey are LUNKHEAD,and they<br />\ncame to conquer.<br />\nTickets were twenty-five bucks<br />\nfrom some grizzled hippy taking<br />\ntime off from the latest Dead<br />\ntour.

They<br />\nknew what kind of crowd<br />\nLUNKHEAD attracted and the<br />\nkind of trouble they made. Middle age bikers, acid casualties and<br />\ncollege paper editors. It's a<br />\nviolent combination and they<br />\nwere ready for us with tear gas,<br />\nwater guns and piles of Soldier of<br />\nFortune magazines. I heard the<br />\ncops saying something about<br />\npacifying the crowd with intense<br />\nbursts of sound. I wanted to laugh<br />\nout loud and scream to him,<br />\n'Hah, you fool! That'd never<br />\nwork. That's what we're here<br />\nfor!' God, I thought, I love rock<br />\nconcerts.<br />\nIt takes us almost an hour to<br />\nfind our seats and another twenty minutes to convince these to<br />\ngeezers that they're in our seats.<br />\nWe're just about to kick them out<br />\nphysically when we notice their<br />\nmetal tipped canes. Holy Diamond Ball, I think, these dudes<br />\nare Gray Panthers.

We'd have<br />\nto watch our step. This was no<br />\nkid's show.<br />\nThe opening act comes and the<br />\ncrowd instantly lets them know<br />\nwhat they think of them. The<br />\nband plays for ten minutes then<br />\nretreats in a hail of mucus and<br />\nbeer cans. The nest group comes<br />\non. Same thing happens, only<br />\nfaster. Then comes a group<br />\nwhose name I've actually heard.<br />\nI hate them. They're one of those<br />\ngroups that break up, reform,<br />\ntour and make loads of money off<br />\nof unsuspecting teenagers with<br />\nbad family lives and even worst<br />\ntaste in music. You may<br />\nremember them in some of their<br />\nprevious incarnations: Emerson,<br />\nLake, and FILL-IN THE<br />\nBLANK. This time around<br /><br />\nthey're taking a comedic slant by<br />\nincluding Peewee Herman on<br />\ndrums. (No word yet as to<br />\nwhether he'll be asked to OD.)<br />\nAnyway, they start playing but<br />\nthe crowd completely ignores<br />\nthem until Peewee jumps out<br />\nfrom behind the drrums after his<br />\nsolo and bites the head off a rubber chicken. Ooh boy, they loved that one.<br />\nAt last the men we came to see<br />\nmake it to the stage. They arrive<br />\non the backs of giant mechanical<br />\nslugs, celebrating the release of<br />\ntheir latest album, SLUGFEST.<br />\nNow few bands are as consistently experimental as<br />\nLUNKHEAD and even fewer<br />\nwould dare start out their show<br />\nwith a drum solo but there it<br />\nis.Heinrich Mulfer, the band's<br />\ndrummer, is a mster of both<br />\nCeltic and Yiddish rhythmic<br />\nforms and he pounds them out<br />\nlike nobody's business. When it<br />\nends, some twenty minutes later,<br />\nthe audience erupts into applause.<br />\nThen the whole band launches into the new single, \"Saltshaker<br />\nfrom Hell\" which features a driving bass line, explosive drums, and a screaming<br />\nguitar solo that sends the crowd<br />\ninto convulsions.<br />\nFrom this point on, the concert<br />\nbecomes an unending stream of<br />\nraw,jagged, unrelenting, socially aware noise. The sound system<br />\nis so loud it could part your hair<br />\nat ten thousand feet; one of the<br />\nolder commented happily that he<br />\nhadn't had to wear his hearing aid<br />\nat all. The lighting blazes white<br />\nhot, tearing brightly colored holes<br />\nthrough the clouds sent up by the<br />\nsmoke machines. During the<br />\nclimactic \"Beer in the Garden\"<br />\nnumber, lead guitarist, Loomis<br />\nWatkins, actually lights his<br />\ncigarette on one of the rotating<br />\nlaser lights. It was one of ;the<br />\nhigh points of rock and roll<br />\nhistory and you missed it.<br />\nFinally, after the sixth score,<br />\nLUNKHEAD left the stage for<br />\nthe last time, leaving the audience<br />\nin what can only be described as<br />\npre-coital depression.

I once saw a diehard Rush fan shake his head<br />\nafter hearing \"YYZ\" and say<br />\nwith feeling, \"Neil Peart is<br />\nRush.\"<br />\nWhether or not this is true,<br />\nthere is no dissension on the fact<br />\nthat Peart makes brilliantly<br />\ncreative use of his bewilderingly<br />\nlarge drumkit, complete with<br />\nglockenspiel, gongs, bells and<br />\nelectronic percussion. Peart has<br />\nachieved the widest musical appreciation yet among popular audiences. Fans are listening to him<br />\ninstead of looking solely for<br />\nvisual flash. However, as Peart<br />\nwould unquestionably agree,<br />\nother drummers on the musical<br />\nscene deserve to be analyzed for<br />\ntheir musical expertise. Critical<br />\nappreciation relies on an<br />\nenlightened audience, free of the<br /><br />\nold myths of drummers' unsophistication and insensitivity to<br />\nmusical subtleties.<br />\nFusion drummer Danny Gottlieb has played with notable<br />\nmusicians John McLaughlin, Gil<br />\nEvens, Pat Metheny, and Al<br />\nDimeola (who appeared last<br />\nsemester in Shriver). Last year,<br />\n\"Acrecorded<br />\nGottlieb<br />\nquamarine\" (Atlantic Records),<br />\na diverse mixture of rock, Latin<br />\nand jazz styles played by an<br />\nequally diverse collection of<br />\nmusicians, such as McLaughlin,<br />\nEvens, John Abercrombie, Steve<br />\nKhan, and Dave Samuels. Fans of<br />\nGottlieb's heavy cymbal excursions during his stay in the<br />\nMahavishnu Orchestra and of his<br />\nmellow cymbal hues supporting<br />\nMel Lewis' Jazz ensemble will<br />\nfind his playing more precise and<br />\nsparse. Gottlieb explains: \"As<br />\nmy playing experience increases<br />\nand I mature as a musician, I'm<br />\ntrying to edit my playing so that<br />\neach beat, fill, and texture has<br />\nmeaning.\"(MD April 1988)<br />\nManu Katche is presently<br />\nrock's hottest drummer. Emerging out of a jazz/fusion<br />\nbackground, this Frenchmen<br /><br />\nlanded successive gigs with Peter<br />\nGabriel's \"So\" and Sting's<br />\n\"Nothing Like The Sun\" tours.<br />\nHis bright, colorful percussion is<br />\nmost popularly evident in the recent Top-40 hit \"Sledgehammer.\" Notice his lively yet<br />\nforceful hi-hat work. His finest<br />\nplaying on \"So\" is during \"In<br />\nYour Eyes,\" a haunting composition made exotic by Mr. Katche's<br />\ntom-tom patterns which blend into and reinforce Tony Levin's<br />\nwarm bass lines. Another fine<br />\ntrack is \"That Voice Again\"<br />\nfeaturing the same close interaction between tom-tom and bass<br />\ndrum patterns with Levin's aggressive melodic lines, along with<br />\na hypnotic hi-hat rythmn and explosive snare fills. Mr. Katch's<br />\ndrumming contributes to the<br />\nsong's dramatic mood.<br />\nKatche's playing on \"Nothing<br />\nLike The Sun\" is less aggressive,<br />\nusing more subtle cymbal patterns that blend into Sting's sequenced percussion tracks. The<br />\nbest drum performance is on<br />\n\"The Lazarus Heart.\" He plays<br />\na strong funk groove with bassist,<br />\nproviding a solid underpinning<br />\nover which Andy Summers lays<br /><br />\nhis open, airy guitar riffs.<br />\nis<br />\nfine<br />\ntrack<br />\nAnother<br />\n\"Englishman in New York.\"<br />\nAfter the initial reggae section,<br />\nthe band breaks into a hot jazz<br />\ngroove.

Expressive and creative individual<br />\nperformances are few and far<br />\nbetween\u2014a result of the industry's homogenizing desire for<br />\ncommercial success and popularity. Nevertheless, certain artists<br />\nmanage to escape the net of<br />\nprofit-awareness, and take<br />\nmusical risks. Next time you<br />\nlisten to your favorite album, pick<br />\nout the drums.

They<br />\nhave succeeded in more than fairrepresenting<br />\nGuare's<br />\nly<br />\nideologies, while not beating the<br />\naudience over the head with<br />\nthem. They have succeeded in<br />\ncreating continuity and focus out<br />\nof chaos. They have even managed to make a funny play on paper<br />\nfunny on stage.<br />\nSkillful lighting provided a<br />\nfocus for the audience, as well as<br />\nestablishing the real from the<br />\nunreal. In one scene, Betty, while<br />\nbeing interogated, has a mental<br />\nimage of her old boss and her<br />\nsister. But due to the placement<br />\nand well laid out scenes, the<br />\ncharacters in her mind seem just<br />\nthat - in her mind. The two<br />\ncharacters on stage close in<br />\ntogether at center, and Betty's<br />\nmind fills up the empty space.<br />\nThe play is largely a mental play,<br />\ntaking place in the minds of<br />\ncharacters. The lighting gave it<br />\nthat vivid mental idea - very<br />\nbright resolution and not-quitedarkness for thoughts, contrasted<br />\nwith the more realistic lighting<br />\nfor the \"real\" scenes at the<br />\nbeginning and end.<br />\nAdept staging linked the lights to<br />\nthe drama. Rosalie's explaination<br />\nof her job (a \"flashback\" for<br />\nRosalie) just before she is killed<br />\nwas fantastic. The scene went<br />\nfrom the living room to Rosalie's<br />\nmind to the street without skipping a beat. It went from<br />\ntragicomic, listening to Betty and<br />\nRosalie talk about their loving<br />\nand exciting lives respectively, to<br /><br />\njust plain tragic (Rosalie is killed), to plain comic, as Jonathan<br />\nAbrahams, in one of his three<br />\nroles, comes out to rant and rave<br />\nabout his bike.<br />\nAnd let's talk about the actors.<br />\nMost notable, for my money, was<br />\nMary Kita as Rosalie.

At the other end of the<br />\nscale are the leaders of the movement for sexual freedom, who<br />\ndownplay the possibility of risk in<br />\nfavor of fulfillment of desire.<br />\nThe media has been forced to<br />\nsort through these conflicting<br />\nstories in its efforts to present<br />\n\"the AIDS story\" to the public.<br />\nDavid Schneiderman, former<br />\neditor-in-chief of the Village<br />\nVoice, gave the Frank R. Kent<br />\nMemorial Lecture on March 17.<br />\nHe said that in the early stages of<br />\nthe epidemic the Voice \"erred on<br />\nthe side of caution, trying not to<br />\nalarm our readers.\" He wished<br />\nthat there had been more press<br />\ncoverage sooner, because he<br />\nthought that greater exposure<br />\nwould have led to pressure on the<br />\ngovernment to allocate funds for<br />\nAIDS research. The first time the<br />\nAIDS virus hit the front page of<br />\nwidely influential publications<br />\nwas the July 1985 announcement<br />\nthat Rock Hudson was dying of<br /><br />\nAIDS.<br />\nAltogether, the epidemiologists, the proponents of sexual liberation, and the understandably cautious and confused<br />\nmedia have contributed to a<br />\n'massive tangle of information,<br />\nopinion,<br />\nmisinformation,<br />\nfanaticism, fear, and paranoia<br />\nthat all falls under the classification of \"the AIDS story.\"<br />\nThanks to Dr. Cone's invaluable<br />\nassistance, the following is about<br />\nthe closest thing there is to an accurate and moderate account of<br />\nAIDS in heterosexuals.<br />\nDr. Cone explained that there<br />\nis a possibility that the AIDS<br />\nvirus residing in its host white<br />\nblood cells is as infectious as the<br />\nfree virus. It is crucial to prevent<br />\ncontact between fluids that contain cells and one's own<br />\nbloodstream. This can be accomplished by avoiding sex that<br />\ncould break the skin, avoiding<br />\ncontact with cell fluids if there exist open sores, and not sharing<br />\nneedles. Exercise caution and use<br />\nprophylactics. Deep kissing is<br />\nalmost definitely safe, and so is<br />\noral sex if there is no contact with<br />\nthe bloodstream (like a mouth<br />\nulcer) because the virus is probably destroyed by acids in the<br />\nstomach. There are risks, and no<br />\none knows the odds, and so the<br /><br />\nquestion of how cautious to be<br />\neventually becomes a personal<br />\ndecision.<br />\nMasters and Johnson's point of<br />\nview is different. They say that<br />\nAIDS is \"running rampant in the<br />\nheterosexual community.\" Later<br />\nin the article, they cite their own<br />\npredictions of one woman in four<br />\nhundred encounters and one man<br />\nin six hundred encounters contracting AIDS. An editorial by<br />\nEllen Goodman, published in the<br />\nMarch 10 Baltimore Sun, quotes<br />\nDr. Masters' reason for using<br />\nsuch inflammatory language: \"I<br />\nsimply believe it.\"<br />\nAside from AIDS, Dr. Cone<br />\nsaid that there are other Sexually<br />\nTransmitted Disease (STDs)<br />\nwhich have fallen from prominence in the media, but not<br />\nfrom prominence in the population. According to Marilyn Gall,<br />\nClinic Nurse and Administrator<br />\nof the Health Clinic, the most<br />\ncommon STDs among Hopkins<br />\nstudents she's seen are chlamydia<br />\nand genital warts. While in men<br />\nchlamydia is a painful condition,<br />\nin women it can go unnoticed and<br />\neventually will cause infertility.<br />\nGenital warts are disfiguring and<br />\nincurable. Prophylactics are an<br />\nimportant preventative measure<br />\nnot just for AIDS, but for all<br />\nSTDs.<br /><br />\nSTUDY IN EUROPE<br /><br />\nThe University of Louvain (est. 1425), Leuven, Beigu!rn offers<br />\nComplete programmes in Philosophy for the<br />\ndegrees of BA., M.A., and Ph.D plus<br />\na junior year abroad programme<br />\nAll courses are in English<br />\neTtumition is 14.500 Belgium Franks( $250)<br />\nWrite<br />\nseuv<br />\nre,.ary English Programmes<br />\nKaroinaal Meraerplein 2,13.3000 Leuven, Belgium<br /><br />\n11.11111.1111111M\"<br />\n.<br />\n41111\".111111111<br />\n.<br />\n11MMI<br />\nHOURS<br />\n10-6 MON -SAT<br /><br />\nAIDS and the press:<br />\nWhich are we to believe<br /><br />\nK.U.

None of Hopkins'<br />\nthree victims-Washington College, Rutgers, and Princeton-are<br />\ntop-ten teams, while Washington<br />\nCollege belongs to Division III.<br />\nNonetheless, the Jays seem to<br />\nhave gained some sort of momentum in a season that started with<br />\nturmoil. A month before the<br />\nopener, star sophomore goalie<br />\nQuint Kessenich was suspended<br />\nfor one game by head coach Don<br />\nZimmerman. Kessenich and two<br />\nteammates, defensemen Dave<br />\nHowland and James DeTomasso,<br /><br />\nhad damaged furniture in the lobby of the Northway apartment<br />\nbuilding. A month later, immediately following the Syracuse<br />\nloss, attackman John Ciccarone<br />\nand midfielders John and Mark<br />\nDressel quit the team for what<br />\nthey said were personal reasons.<br />\nBoth Ciccarone and John Dressel<br />\nwere starters.<br />\nNonetheless, Hopkins traditionally performs better in the second half of the season. Coach<br />\nZimmerman expects the team to<br />\nprogress with each week. If this<br />\nhappens, the Blue Jays just may<br />\nhave a chance against the best<br />\nteams in the nation, whom they<br />\nencounter starting tomorrow<br />\nwhen they travel to Charlottesville to take on the University<br />\nof Virginia.<br />\nThe question on everyone's<br />\nmind will be whether the Hopkins<br />\noffense can score enough goals to<br />\nkeep up with its stellar defense.<br /><br />\nIn 1987, the Jays lost to graduation super scorers Craig Bubier<br />\nand Brian Wood. This season, top<br />\ngun Mike Morrill remains, but<br />\nwill his attack-entourage prove<br />\npotent enough to outscore the<br />\nlikes of Virginia, North Carolina,<br />\nand Maryland, whom Hopkins<br />\nwill face in three of the next four<br />\nweeks?<br />\nJunior Jeff Ihm and sophomore<br />\nScott Marr have replaced Bubier<br />\nand Ciccarone, and have combined for 10 goals and 5 assists in<br />\nfour games. Marr looked particularly impressive against<br />\nPrinceton, recording three goals<br />\nand an assist. Morrill, meanwhile, has 7 goals and 3 assists.<br />\nBut the most promising cog in<br />\nthe Hopkins attack has to be<br />\nfreshman Matt Panetta, who has<br />\nregistered 5 goals and 2 assists,<br />\nand has scored in each of the<br />\nSee LAX, 26<br /><br />\n\"The oldest<br /><br />\nnation\"<br />\n\"Every college playing lacrosse, regardless of its division is condidered\"<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n8<br />\n9<br />\n10<br /><br />\nSyracuse (5)<br />\nMaryland (1)<br />\nNorth Carolina<br />\nVirginia<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\nLoyola<br />\nBrown<br />\nHarvard<br />\nCornell<br />\nTowson St.<br /><br />\nRecord<br />\n5-0<br />\n4-0<br />\n5-1<br />\n5-0<br />\n3-1<br />\n6-0<br />\n3-1<br />\n4-0<br />\n2-2<br />\n5-1<br /><br />\nPts<br />\n59<br />\n55<br />\n47<br />\n43<br />\n36<br />\n28<br />\n151/2<br />\n13<br />\n11<br />\n5<br /><br />\n(First place votes in parentheses)<br />\nOthers receiving votes: C.W.

We're a strong<br />\nteam, we'll have to take it one<br />\ngame at a time.\" The setbacks in<br />\ngoal revolve around the knee injury of senior goalie Laura Porter<br />\nand the recent illness of freshman<br />\nkeeper Dawn Nee. Both<br />\ngoalkeepers will be out for the<br />\nduration of the season.<br />\nWith Wednesday night's victory over cross-town rival<br />\nGoucher College, a tough loss to<br />\nRoanoke in a game plagued by<br />\nrain, hail, and delay, and wins<br />\nover Washington College and<br />\nSwarthmore, the Lady Jays have<br />\ncompiled a 3-1 record. This<br />\nyear's team is dominated by experience in that no starters were<br />\nlost to graduation. Returning for<br />\nanother season at Homewood are<br />\nAll-Americans Heather Klink<br />\n(co-leader in assists) and Alice<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nCollins (scoring leader); seniors<br />\nJen Stahl, Liz Davis, Erika<br />\nFeller, Kacie White, Laura<br />\nPorter, and Maggie Schmidt;<br />\njunior Kathy Hart, and<br />\nsophomores Julie Siegrist, Carrie<br />\nAllalemdjian, and Patty Lagator<br />\n(co-leader in assists). Joining the<br />\nteam this spring are freshmen<br />\nKara Tipton, Kristin Cole, Cathy<br />\nMoskel, Jen Chun, Kathy Herring, Dawn Nee, and Tara Fram.<br />\nLagator feels that,\"we have a lot<br />\nof talent on this team. The<br />\nfreshmen look good, and hopefully we will maintain the skill level<br />\nwe had last year and continue to<br />\nbetter ourselves.\" Last season<br />\nHopkins compiled a record of<br />\n10-3 and won the Maryland College Tournament.<br />\nIn Wednesday night's wide<br />\nmargin win over Goucher College 22-3, Hopkins displayed<br />\nquickness and an accurate passing game that was too much for<br />\nthe slower Gophers to keep up<br />\nwith, much less shut down. Top<br />\nscorers in that game were<br />\nSchmidt with 1 goal and 5 assists,<br />\nLagator with 5 goals, and Tipton,<br /><br />\nScrambling for<br /><br />\nCollins, and Moskel with four<br />\npoints apiece. Strong defensive<br />\nplay by Siegrist, Stahl, Davis,<br />\nAllalemdjian, and Feller, and a<br />\ngood effort by Cole in the net<br />\nresulted in allowing only three<br />\nGopher goals. Cole, a freshman<br />\nfrom Chichester, PA, appeared in<br />\ngoal for her first time ever. Said<br />\nco-captain Davis, \"Kristin is a<br />\ngreat player on the field, but she's<br />\nonly been in goal one practice.<br />\nShe's being a good sport because<br />\nthe team needs her.\" Cole is<br />\nusually a defenseman. The offense did a good job of keeping<br />\nthe ball upfield and away from<br />\ntheir own net with good efforts by<br />\nHart and co-captain Klink, and<br />\nquick accurate passing from<br />\nSchmidt to Lagator, as well as<br />\ncontributions from Collins, Tipton, and Moskel.<br />\nConsidering the Lady Jays problems in goal coupled with a<br />\nrigorous travelling schedule, the<br />\nteam looks good and according to<br />\nDavis, \"we've really pulled<br />\ntogether,\" and as Klink adds,<br />\n\"are bouncing back.\"<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\ns tickets?<br /><br />\n3-for-3 (1.000) career batting<br />\nby P.

Hopkins placed<br />\nfifth out of seventeen teams in a<br />\ngrueling, five-hour, full course<br />\ncompetition with a score of 3965<br />\nout of a possible 4800.<br />\nThis was Hopkins' best score<br />\nof the season, and Coach Hardy<br />\nwas pleased with the results.<br />\n\"When you go into a match, all<br />\nyou can ask for is to shoot your<br />\nbest. Each shooter is in competition with himself, and if you<br />\nshoot your best score, the match<br />\nis a success.\"<br /><br />\nThe match was the only full<br />\ncourse (120 record shots, 40 in<br />\neach position of prone, kneeling,<br />\nand standing, as opposed to the<br />\nusual 60 shot half course) that<br />\nHopkins fired this season. Taking<br />\nseveral hours to complete, the full<br />\ncourse is a test of endurance as<br />\nwell as consistency and deadly accuracy over time. The most difficult part of the full course is the<br />\neighty minute standing position.<br />\nTo be competitive here the<br />\nshooter must prove strong and<br />\nsteady enough to hold his unsupported, thirteen pound rifle for<br />\nover an hour while consistently<br />\ndelivering forty .22 caliber projectiles fifty feet away to an area<br />\nthe size of an aspirin.<br /><br />\nSophomore sharpshooter Jim<br />\n\"I just can't miss\" Kielkopf led<br />\nthe Hopkins riflemen in scoring<br />\nwith his personal record of 1059<br />\nout of 1200. He finished sixth<br />\noverall in a field of 47 shooters.<br />\nSophomore starter Matthew<br />\nMayr also fired his personal best<br />\nwith a score of 975. Senior Adam<br />\nKristol wrapped up a successful<br />\ncollege career with a healthy 994,<br />\nbut team captain Neil Seidman<br />\nchoked in the standing position<br />\nand finished below his expected<br />\nability. Also firing in the sec-<br /><br />\ntionals in the individual competitions were sophomore Larry<br />\nYoung and freshman Matt<br />\nFischer.<br />\n1987-88 has been one of the<br />\nmost successful seasons in recent<br />\nyears for Hopkins. The Blue Jays<br />\nimproved their match average<br />\nscores by 131 points over last<br />\nseason, making Hopkins the most<br />\nimproved team in the league. This<br />\nfurnished the team with victories<br />\nover Yale, Princeton, Rider, and<br />\nPenn State Delco but was not<br />\nenough to defeat the nowerful<br /><br />\nscholarship teams of St. John's,<br />\nPenn State Main, Army, and<br />\nNavy.<br />\nIn addition to Adam Kristol,<br />\nthe two other seniors that will be<br />\nlost to graduation are Brian Kurtz<br />\nand John Cieslowski. Despite<br />\nthese losses,junior Neil Seidman<br />\nis optimistic that the team will be<br />\neven stronger next year. \"We<br />\nhave a lot of talent to improve on<br />\nthat will still be around for one<br />\nor two years; our best shots have<br />\ntwo years left.

With the seniors<br />\nand freshmen pushing and abetting each other, Coach Blank<br />\ndoubled the 4 victories of the<br />\nprevious season and finished the<br />\nyear with an 8-12 record.<br />\nSenior point guard Jeanne<br />\nClark (Mountain Lakes, NJ),<br />\nwho led the team in assists, was<br />\nthe catalyst for the Hopkins offense. Coach Blank believes<br /><br />\nClark's leadership and court<br />\nawareness was a key to the team's<br />\nimproved performance. Senior<br />\nCindy Harper (Philadelphia, PA)<br />\nbecame only the second player in<br />\nHopkins history to score 1000<br />\npoints in a career.<br />\nThe Hopkins offensive punch<br />\nwas supplied by the freshman<br />\nclass. Kristi Kantowski (Ellicott<br />\nCity, MD) led the Blue Jays in<br />\nscoring, averaging fourteen<br />\npoints per game. Jennifer Luzietti<br />\n(Shelton, CT)finished the season<br />\nwith a 10.6 ppg average, and<br />\nJulianne Rolapp (Darnestwon,<br />\nMD) was the 3rd highest scorer<br />\nwith a 9.6 per game average.<br />\nRolapp led the team in three point<br />\nshots, scoring on 41 percent of<br />\nher shots from beyond the 19 foot<br /><br />\n9 inch arc.<br />\nIn the rebounding department,<br />\nJennifer Luzietti led Hopkins with<br />\n6.8 rebounds per game.
