You can not expect to run the department on a shoe string budget like we have now. There is a definite<br />\nneed for at least a 50% increase. (2) There should be a change<br />\nin the whole university setup in that the predominant emphasis<br />\nshould not be placed upon intellectual training to the exclusion<br />\nof concern for the whole individual, as it seems to have been recently. (3) At least one additional full time staff methber should be<br />\nadded over and above the plans for the '54-'55 school year. (4)<br />\nEither salaries should be increased, or whatever fault exists,<br />\ncorrected to improve on tlie average tenure of our coaching staff.<br />\n(5) Facilities, equipment, medical care, and award policies should<br />\nbe improved upon so as to keep the student participation at a<br />\nhigh level. (6) Scheduling and team budgets should be gone over<br />\nthoroughly with coach and captains, if possible. (7) All pennypinching by the department should cease. For instance, the few<br />\nextra dollars should be spent to send reserves to away contests.<br />\n(8) Practice good public relations at all times (home and away).<br />\n(9) Finally, administrators, remember it's not very much fun<br />\nlosing.<br />\n<br />\nlet guarding.

There is no excuse<br />\nat all why our gym should not be packed to the rafters tomorrow<br />\nnight. Sure exams are coming but every student.can afford a few<br />\nhours off a week to watch a Jay athletic contest. In previous<br />\n\u2022 years there seems to have been fewer than one third of our<br />\nstudent body at any contest. how would it be if we charged admission? Naturally not everyone likes to watch basketball, but<br />\nyear in and year out there are terl5 many IIopkins students who<br />\nnever even see any type of contest all year. What is it with these<br />\nguys? The Nester can't -tell you, since he knows none of them<br />\npersonally and actually never cares to know them. (They probably<br />\nnever care to know him either!)<br />\nNow that we've discussed the administrators' and students'<br />\npart it's time to say that the added encouragement of our faculty<br />\n(which is definitely more kicking than at any other university<br />\never visited) could aid the cause, too.<br />\nIf and when these changes come about, The Hopkins will<br />\nhave .an athletic program to be proud of.

In order to avoid the possibility of any suspicions being directed against you leave all unnecessary notes and books outside the exam room.<br />\n3. Hesitate from talking during an exam.

Last November 13, -the fourth<br />\nin a series of columns on the Hopkins athletic program appeared<br />\nin this space, and now two months later the time has come to<br />\ndraw a few conclusions. We could spend the rest of the year<br />\ndiscussing each phase of the program and actually get almost<br />\nnowhere7therefore, we've decided to conclude at this time.<br />\nIn recent years there have been complaints from students<br />\non just about every phase of the athletic set-up at this university.<br />\nSonic are legitimate and some just personal gripes, but all have<br />\ntheir points. They've complained about locker room facilities,<br />\nequipment, our trainer and training facilities, schedules, coaches,<br />\nindoor-play facilities, general policy, intramurals, participation,<br />\nawards, faculty and student support, and some even complained<br />\na few years back about the-.men handing out the inner-gear.<br />\nSpeaking of ridiculous complaints, it was just a few short weeks<br />\nago when The Nester overheard a few Hopkins students saying that<br />\nour admissions office was giving out too many athletic scholarships.<br /><br />\nHopkins, 84-62, the Blacif and BO<br />\ncloses the season with ten co\u00b0<br />\nsecutive M-D games.

You can not expect to run the department on a shoe string budget like we have now. There is a definite<br />\nneed for at least a 50% increase. (2) There should be a change<br />\nin the whole university setup in that the predominant emphasis<br />\nshould not be placed upon intellectual training to the exclusion<br />\nof concern for the whole individual, as it seems to have been recently. (3) At least one additional full time staff methber should be<br />\nadded over and above the plans for the '54-'55 school year. (4)<br />\nEither salaries should be increased, or whatever fault exists,<br />\ncorrected to improve on tlie average tenure of our coaching staff.<br />\n(5) Facilities, equipment, medical care, and award policies should<br />\nbe improved upon so as to keep the student participation at a<br />\nhigh level. (6) Scheduling and team budgets should be gone over<br />\nthoroughly with coach and captains, if possible. (7) All pennypinching by the department should cease. For instance, the few<br />\nextra dollars should be spent to send reserves to away contests.<br />\n(8) Practice good public relations at all times (home and away).<br />\n(9) Finally, administrators, remember it's not very much fun<br />\nlosing.<br /><br />\nlet guarding.

The support,<br />\neither as participant or fan, is needed from each and every one of<br />\nthe students at the Homewood campus today. There is no excuse<br />\nat all why our gym should not be packed to the rafters tomorrow<br />\nnight. Sure exams are coming but every student.can afford a few<br />\nhours off a week to watch a Jay athletic contest. In previous<br />\n\u2022 years there seems to have been fewer than one third of our<br />\nstudent body at any contest. how would it be if we charged admission? Naturally not everyone likes to watch basketball, but<br />\nyear in and year out there are terl5 many IIopkins students who<br />\nnever even see any type of contest all year. What is it with these<br />\nguys? The Nester can't -tell you, since he knows none of them<br />\npersonally and actually never cares to know them. (They probably<br />\nnever care to know him either!)<br />\nNow that we've discussed the administrators' and students'<br />\npart it's time to say that the added encouragement of our faculty<br />\n(which is definitely more kicking than at any other university<br />\never visited) could aid the cause, too.<br />\nIf and when these changes come about, The Hopkins will<br />\nhave .an athletic program to be proud of. The students of this<br />\nuniversity are not proud of it not and until something is done<br />\nour thoughts will not change.
