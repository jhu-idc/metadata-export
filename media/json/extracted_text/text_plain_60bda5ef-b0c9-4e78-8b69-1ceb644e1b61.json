But though the administration's priorities in<br />\nthe area of property investment may not be reprehensible,<br />\nit s methods of dealing with specific problems which arise<br />\nfrom such University action certainly are.<br />\nRecent rumblings in the community have revealed that<br />\nHopkins has not made good on its word to allow the tenants<br />\nof 3201 North Charles to leave the building of their own<br />\nvolition. While some tenants have alleged harrassment on the<br />\npart of the University, others have charged simply that they<br />\nwill not be allowed to renew their leases, even under unusual<br />\ncircumstances. And though it may be the University's<br />\ntechnical right to exert such influence, such action speaks of<br />\ngreat hypocrisy on the part of an administration which<br />\nspeaks fondly of its relations with the community and even<br />\nmaintains an office dedicated to that area.<br />\nIn addition, the brusque treatment of members of the<br />\ncommunity has led to legal action from the Greater<br />\nHomewood Community Corporation, which, though it<br />\ncharges a zoning violation on the part of the University, was<br />\nessentially taken aback by the imperiousness with which<br />\nHopkins took hold a local property. Charging like a bull into<br />\nthe community in search of overflow office space is not only<br />\nin violation of municipal ordinance but evidences an<br />\nindifference to the local community which borders on<br />\ncontempt.<br />\nThough the legal aspects of the problem will soon be<br />\nsettled decisively, solving the problem of attitude will require<br />\ngreater respect on the part of the administration for the<br />\nsensibilities and the power of the local community.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI found it very interesting that<br />\nAndy Fredman, et al have found it<br />\nnecessary to propose alteration of<br />\nthe selections process for the Eisenhower Symposium theme for<br />\nnext year.

It is no surprise, then,<br />\nthat the changed law has caused<br />\nconsiderable incase in popular<br />\n<br />\nlast year was that under the vague<br />\ndefinition of marijuana in the Annotated Code, not only grass but<br />\nalso hashish and hash oil would be<br />\ndecriminalized.

The second part is a retroactive clause<br />\nwhich would allow one to file a<br />\nmotion for a court-ordered expungement of one's criminal record for simple possession following a minimum period of three<br />\nyears of good behavior. Passage of<br />\nS.B. 755 would not alter the penalty for sale or distribution of marijuana, not would it change any<br />\nother laws regulating any other<br />\ndrugs.<br />\nEffects of the Change<br />\nPassage of this bill would, however, have several immediately obvious effects. First, and most important to the individual: a violator would be able to continue to<br />\nprepare for or serve in any of the<br />\nmany professions such as law, medicine, teaching, or government service which are closed to persons<br />\nwith criminal arrest records.

(Washington, D.C.)shows that<br />\nOregon's pot-smoking population<br />\nhas not significantly increased.<br />\nMoreover, of those who do smoke<br />\nmarijuana, five percent state that<br />\ntheir pot consumption has increased, while 40% assert they are<br />\nactually smoking less.<br />\nAnother argument was that decrimininalization would demonstrate society's approval for use of<br />\nthe drug. To avoid this, criminal<br />\npenalties were maintained for sale<br />\nand distribution, and simple possession was not decriminalized<br />\ncompletely.<br />\nSignificantly, during last November's state elections in Oregon,<br />\nevery single candidate endorsed the<br />\nmarijuana compromise.<br />\nMaryland<br />\nSenator Mitchell sponsored a<br />\nsimilar decriminalization bill in<br />\nAnnapolis last year. It was de<br />\nfeated in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee for a number<br />\nof reasons. First, it was an election<br />\nyear and the issue was viewed as<br />\ntoo controversial to consider at<br />\nlength; this year it isn't. Second',<br />\nthere were no statistics out last<br />\nyear; this year there are and they<br />\nall urge passage.

We are continuing to spend millions of taxpayers' dollars ($1400 per arrest in<br />\nCalifornia last year) on the police<br />\nofficers, probation officers, judges,<br />\ncourt clerks, public defenders, jail<br />\nand court personnel needed to enforce the current marijuana laws.<br />\nAt best, these laws protect the individual from the uncertain hazards of indulging in marijuanaalthough the current estimate is<br />\nthat some 30,000,000 Americans<br />\nhave taken the risk all the same. At<br />\nworst,' these laws serve as an open<br />\ninvitation for police to harass persons whom they happen not to<br />\nlike. The ultimate loss, however, is<br />\nincurred by all of us, for these unrespected, selectively enforced laws<br />\nare kept on the books at the expense of the quality of life in our<br />\ncities, and hence in our whole<br />\ncountry.<br />\nIt is this writer's opinion that<br />\neveryone in Maryland stands to<br />\nbenefit from this state's immediate<br />\nadoption of the Oregon marijuana<br />\ncompromise.

WARREN<br /><br />\nrumblings<br />\nIn light of the expertise which is employed in large scale<br />\nproperty purchases and the great risks which accompany such<br />\nendeavors in a strapped economy, it is difficult to criticize<br />\nthe University's recent decisions in this area, particularly the<br />\nacquisition of the Gladwyn Manor Apartments at 3201 North<br />\nCharles Street. But though the administration's priorities in<br />\nthe area of property investment may not be reprehensible,<br />\nit s methods of dealing with specific problems which arise<br />\nfrom such University action certainly are.<br />\nRecent rumblings in the community have revealed that<br />\nHopkins has not made good on its word to allow the tenants<br />\nof 3201 North Charles to leave the building of their own<br />\nvolition. While some tenants have alleged harrassment on the<br />\npart of the University, others have charged simply that they<br />\nwill not be allowed to renew their leases, even under unusual<br />\ncircumstances. And though it may be the University's<br />\ntechnical right to exert such influence, such action speaks of<br />\ngreat hypocrisy on the part of an administration which<br />\nspeaks fondly of its relations with the community and even<br />\nmaintains an office dedicated to that area.<br />\nIn addition, the brusque treatment of members of the<br />\ncommunity has led to legal action from the Greater<br />\nHomewood Community Corporation, which, though it<br />\ncharges a zoning violation on the part of the University, was<br />\nessentially taken aback by the imperiousness with which<br />\nHopkins took hold a local property. Charging like a bull into<br />\nthe community in search of overflow office space is not only<br />\nin violation of municipal ordinance but evidences an<br />\nindifference to the local community which borders on<br />\ncontempt.<br />\nThough the legal aspects of the problem will soon be<br />\nsettled decisively, solving the problem of attitude will require<br />\ngreater respect on the part of the administration for the<br />\nsensibilities and the power of the local community.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI found it very interesting that<br />\nAndy Fredman, et al have found it<br />\nnecessary to propose alteration of<br />\nthe selections process for the Eisenhower Symposium theme for<br />\nnext year.

First, and most important to the individual: a violator would be able to continue to<br />\nprepare for or serve in any of the<br />\nmany professions such as law, medicine, teaching, or government service which are closed to persons<br />\nwith criminal arrest records. Second, and most important to crimewracked urban areas: whereas the<br />\narrest procedure often keeps a<br />\npolice officer down at the stationhouse for two to three hours (exelusive of later court appearances)<br />\na ticket can be written up in five<br />\nminutes, leaving the officer almost<br /><br />\nCox-1117mmis,<br />\n, of<br />\nr)r)It<br /><br />\ntheargumentsargumentsmaw<br /><br />\nagainst the passage 'of the original<br />\nlaw in Oregon was the fear that the<br />\nstate would turn into a mecca for<br />\nmarijuana users. However, a oneyear-later study conducted by the<br />\nindependent Drug Abuse Council,<br />\nInc. (Washington, D.C.)shows that<br />\nOregon's pot-smoking population<br />\nhas not significantly increased.<br />\nMoreover, of those who do smoke<br />\nmarijuana, five percent state that<br />\ntheir pot consumption has increased, while 40% assert they are<br />\nactually smoking less.<br />\nAnother argument was that decrimininalization would demonstrate society's approval for use of<br />\nthe drug. To avoid this, criminal<br />\npenalties were maintained for sale<br />\nand distribution, and simple possession was not decriminalized<br />\ncompletely.<br />\nSignificantly, during last November's state elections in Oregon,<br />\nevery single candidate endorsed the<br />\nmarijuana compromise.<br />\nMaryland<br />\nSenator Mitchell sponsored a<br />\nsimilar decriminalization bill in<br />\nAnnapolis last year. It was de<br />\nfeated in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee for a number<br />\nof reasons. First, it was an election<br />\nyear and the issue was viewed as<br />\ntoo controversial to consider at<br />\nlength; this year it isn't. Second',<br />\nthere were no statistics out last<br />\nyear; this year there are and they<br />\nall urge passage. Another objection<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nCommittee room this year,<br /><br />\nSenate.<br /><br />\nCostly<br />\nMeanwhile, well over 1,000,000<br />\nAmericans have been arrested for<br />\nsimple possession of marijuana in<br />\nthe last eight years. We are continuing to spend millions of taxpayers' dollars ($1400 per arrest in<br />\nCalifornia last year) on the police<br />\nofficers, probation officers, judges,<br />\ncourt clerks, public defenders, jail<br />\nand court personnel needed to enforce the current marijuana laws.<br />\nAt best, these laws protect the individual from the uncertain hazards of indulging in marijuanaalthough the current estimate is<br />\nthat some 30,000,000 Americans<br />\nhave taken the risk all the same. At<br />\nworst,' these laws serve as an open<br />\ninvitation for police to harass persons whom they happen not to<br />\nlike. The ultimate loss, however, is<br />\nincurred by all of us, for these unrespected, selectively enforced laws<br />\nare kept on the books at the expense of the quality of life in our<br />\ncities, and hence in our whole<br />\ncountry.<br />\nIt is this writer's opinion that<br />\neveryone in Maryland stands to<br />\nbenefit from this state's immediate<br />\nadoption of the Oregon marijuana<br />\ncompromise. Prohibition did not<br />\nwork with alcohol, and it is not<br />\nworking with marijuana.
