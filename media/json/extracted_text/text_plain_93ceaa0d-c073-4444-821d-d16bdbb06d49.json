Hundreds of alumni, from all parts<br />\nof the country, and many other scholars of note are assembled in<br />\nwhat promises to be one of the most significant gatherings of its<br />\nkind ever held. The NEWS-LETTER wishes to add its welcome<br />\nto those already more formally expressed.<br />\nFrom a purely Hopkins point of view, the Half Century<br />\nCelebration is not only the most important event of the year;<br />\nit is the most important in many years, perhaps the greatest since<br />\nthe inauguration of President Gilman. Viewed in this light, the<br />\napathy which seems to prevail is little short of shocking. It would<br />\nbe the most natural thing in the world to call this attitude indifference. But to do justice to the undergraduates, and we naturally include ourselves in that term, we do not think that is<br />\nthe true reason.<br />\nThe real cause is blindness. No student with any claim to intelligence will deny that the event is important. The trouble is<br />\nthat it cannot be seen in its true perspective. Twenty years from<br />\nnow undergraduates, if there be any, will look back on it with<br />\nconsiderable awe and no less regret. At present the everyday<br />\naffairs on the campus\u2014sports, publications, and the hysteria of<br />\nthe open week of fraternity rushing\u2014all claim their share of attention; and leave the Half Century Celebration as an indistinct<br />\nunreality, too big to be grasped at once.<br />\nThe first meeting has already been held; we hope that a fair<br />\nnumber of undergraduates attended. During the remainder of the<br />\ntime, every student would do well to drop his routine activities,<br />\nor even neglect an assignment or two; and attend any phase of<br />\nthe Celebration which is open to him. If in sonic cases that is<br />\nimpossible they can read about it.<br />\n<br />\nDISGUST NOT REQUIRED<br />\nThere is, as anyone who takes the trouble may observe, a<br />\ncolumn in the NEWS-LETTER known as the \"Mailbag,\" composed<br />\nof letters addressed, as a manner of form and courtesy, to the<br />\neditor. Using the numbers of the NEWS-LETTER which have appeared this year as evidence, it would be equally correct to assume<br />\nthat no one may submit a letter unless he is disgusted at something. The object of his wrath makes no difference: it may<br />\nrange from the exhorbitant cost of drinking cups to the organization and administration of the whole University.<br />\nIn this last assertion, however, circumstantial evidence proves<br />\nits inadequacy. A sour frame of mind is in no way frowned<br />\nupon, but it is by no means essential. We see a future for the<br />\n\"Mailbag\" if it is used sensibly. Since Hopkins is a universit5\u2018,<br />\nitiS safe to assume that there is some intellectual life among the<br />\nundergraduates.

It will<br />\nProbably be the last, so I beg you<br />\nto publish this humble epistle.<br />\nFirst, I want to state that I have<br />\nverY little appreciation of the fine<br />\narts; my education in that line has<br />\nbeen sadly neglected: Second, I do<br />\nnot care to oppose any efforts on<br />\nthe part<br />\nof the person or persons<br />\nwho may be trying to beautify the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nBut-----my ideas of aesthetics are<br />\nvery much distorted by the construction<br />\nof a cinder path across<br />\nthe upper quadrangle. I can't understand how a carload of. burnt<br />\ncoal - enhances the appearance of a<br />\nPlot of grass, even though the burnt<br />\ncoal is arranged in a temporarily<br />\nneat way. So much for the aesthetic side.<br />\nWhen the path is completed,- it<br />\nwill be seldom used. Very few peoPle enjoy walking on them, and to<br />\ninY mind for good reasons. The<br />\ncinders dirty your shoes, blow in<br />\nyour eyes, and add to the trouble<br />\nof walking. If the path is not run<br />\nstraight from the West entrance of<br />\nthe<br />\nChemistry Laboratory to the<br />\nflimsy<br />\nwooden steps which facilitate one's descent to the level of<br />\nthe Engineering Buildings, its function as a path will be hopeless.<br />\nMost college students have heard<br />\nthat a straight line is the shortest<br />\ndistance between two points, and<br />\nthey always<br />\nhave this idea in mind<br />\nwhen walking.<br />\nMay I ask how the work on the<br />\nPath has gone<br />\nthis far (half-way)<br />\nfl\u20ac1 escaped the notice of your edi- 1<br />\ntorial<br />\nwriters? I was very much<br />\ndisappointed not to find an article<br />\nabout it in to-day's NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nfact, that is why I took my pen<br />\nhand, etc. Why not appoint a<br />\nccinunittee and have an investiga<br />\ntion?

Hundreds of alumni, from all parts<br />\nof the country, and many other scholars of note are assembled in<br />\nwhat promises to be one of the most significant gatherings of its<br />\nkind ever held. The NEWS-LETTER wishes to add its welcome<br />\nto those already more formally expressed.<br />\nFrom a purely Hopkins point of view, the Half Century<br />\nCelebration is not only the most important event of the year;<br />\nit is the most important in many years, perhaps the greatest since<br />\nthe inauguration of President Gilman. Viewed in this light, the<br />\napathy which seems to prevail is little short of shocking. It would<br />\nbe the most natural thing in the world to call this attitude indifference. But to do justice to the undergraduates, and we naturally include ourselves in that term, we do not think that is<br />\nthe true reason.<br />\nThe real cause is blindness. No student with any claim to intelligence will deny that the event is important. The trouble is<br />\nthat it cannot be seen in its true perspective. Twenty years from<br />\nnow undergraduates, if there be any, will look back on it with<br />\nconsiderable awe and no less regret. At present the everyday<br />\naffairs on the campus\u2014sports, publications, and the hysteria of<br />\nthe open week of fraternity rushing\u2014all claim their share of attention; and leave the Half Century Celebration as an indistinct<br />\nunreality, too big to be grasped at once.<br />\nThe first meeting has already been held; we hope that a fair<br />\nnumber of undergraduates attended. During the remainder of the<br />\ntime, every student would do well to drop his routine activities,<br />\nor even neglect an assignment or two; and attend any phase of<br />\nthe Celebration which is open to him. If in sonic cases that is<br />\nimpossible they can read about it.<br /><br />\nDISGUST NOT REQUIRED<br />\nThere is, as anyone who takes the trouble may observe, a<br />\ncolumn in the NEWS-LETTER known as the \"Mailbag,\" composed<br />\nof letters addressed, as a manner of form and courtesy, to the<br />\neditor. Using the numbers of the NEWS-LETTER which have appeared this year as evidence, it would be equally correct to assume<br />\nthat no one may submit a letter unless he is disgusted at something. The object of his wrath makes no difference: it may<br />\nrange from the exhorbitant cost of drinking cups to the organization and administration of the whole University.<br />\nIn this last assertion, however, circumstantial evidence proves<br />\nits inadequacy. A sour frame of mind is in no way frowned<br />\nupon, but it is by no means essential. We see a future for the<br />\n\"Mailbag\" if it is used sensibly. Since Hopkins is a universit5\u2018,<br />\nitiS safe to assume that there is some intellectual life among the<br />\nundergraduates. They must have views on literature, art, or<br />\nworld affairs; if the views are conflicting, so much the better.<br />\nWhy not make the letter column a forum as well as a complaint<br />\ncolumn ?<br /><br />\nare the only letter men that will<br />\nbe able to fire regularly.

It will<br />\nProbably be the last, so I beg you<br />\nto publish this humble epistle.<br />\nFirst, I want to state that I have<br />\nverY little appreciation of the fine<br />\narts; my education in that line has<br />\nbeen sadly neglected: Second, I do<br />\nnot care to oppose any efforts on<br />\nthe part<br />\nof the person or persons<br />\nwho may be trying to beautify the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nBut-----my ideas of aesthetics are<br />\nvery much distorted by the construction<br />\nof a cinder path across<br />\nthe upper quadrangle. I can't understand how a carload of. burnt<br />\ncoal - enhances the appearance of a<br />\nPlot of grass, even though the burnt<br />\ncoal is arranged in a temporarily<br />\nneat way. So much for the aesthetic side.<br />\nWhen the path is completed,- it<br />\nwill be seldom used. Very few peoPle enjoy walking on them, and to<br />\ninY mind for good reasons. The<br />\ncinders dirty your shoes, blow in<br />\nyour eyes, and add to the trouble<br />\nof walking. If the path is not run<br />\nstraight from the West entrance of<br />\nthe<br />\nChemistry Laboratory to the<br />\nflimsy<br />\nwooden steps which facilitate one's descent to the level of<br />\nthe Engineering Buildings, its function as a path will be hopeless.<br />\nMost college students have heard<br />\nthat a straight line is the shortest<br />\ndistance between two points, and<br />\nthey always<br />\nhave this idea in mind<br />\nwhen walking.<br />\nMay I ask how the work on the<br />\nPath has gone<br />\nthis far (half-way)<br />\nfl\u20ac1 escaped the notice of your edi- 1<br />\ntorial<br />\nwriters? I was very much<br />\ndisappointed not to find an article<br />\nabout it in to-day's NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nfact, that is why I took my pen<br />\nhand, etc. Why not appoint a<br />\nccinunittee and have an investiga<br />\ntion?

He had<br />\ncorralled the picture of a transient phenomenon.
