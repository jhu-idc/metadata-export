It was originally organized<br />\nto fill an engagement at the Casa<br />\nLoma in Toronto, and making such<br />\na startling impression at that time,<br />\nand finding themselves to be a very<br />\ncongenial group, they took steps to<br />\nlegally incorporate, and thus formed<br />\nthe present Casa Loma Orchestra.<br />\nThey elected a set of officers, a<br />\nboard of directors, and set up a business-like structure in which each<br />\nand all of them are both stockholders and-employees. In a recent poll<br />\nconducted by Metronome, famous<br />\nmusician's magazine, it was ranked<br />\nfifth on an all-star eleven, with<br />\nWhiteman, Lombardo, Bernie and<br />\nIsham Jones leading.<br />\nAdmission to the dance is $3.30,<br />\ntax included.

The secret was unearthed in 1849 by the<br />\ngreat magician, Robert-Houdin. At that time, ether<br />\nhad just been discovered, and little was known<br />\nabout it. Houdin claimed that he had discovered<br />\nthat this new anesthetic could make people light as<br />\nair. To prove it, he caused the subject to rise into<br />\nthe air and float apparently suspended. He passed<br />\na hoop around the body to show there were no<br />\nwires or supports.<br />\nEXPLANATION:<br />\n<br />\nThere are many, many explanations for this old<br />\ntrick. One is that the girl wears a concealed harness,<br />\nwhich ends in a socket between her shoulder blades.<br />\nThis is attached to a piston below the stage. The<br />\npiston is pushed up from below, causing her to<br />\nrise in the air. The piston is invisible, because it<br />\nis covered with mirrors which reflect surrounding<br />\ndraperies, similar to the background. The magician can pass the hoop over her body because it<br />\nis cut in one place. It can be pulled apart for a<br />\nsecond when it passes the piston.<br />\nMagic\"by Professor Hoffmann.<br />\nGeorge Routledge & Sons.<br />\n<br />\nSOURCE:\"Modern<br />\n<br />\nNO TRICKS<br />\n..JUST COSTLIER<br />\nTOBACCOS<br />\nIN A<br />\n<br />\nIt's fun to be fooled..<br />\nmore fun to KNOW<br />\nAnother \"magic show\" is cigarette advertising.<br />\nOne of its greatest tricks is the illusion<br />\nthat cigarettes can be made miraculously<br />\n\"MILD\" through manufacturing methods.<br />\nTHE EXPLANATION: All popular cigarettes<br />\ntoday are made in modern sanitary factories<br />\nwith up-to-date machinery. All are heat<br />\ntreated\u2014some more intensively than others,<br />\nbecause raw, inferior tobaccos require<br />\n<br />\nmore intensive treatment than choice, ripe<br />\ntobaccos.<br />\nThe real difference comes in the tobaccos<br />\nthat are used. The better the tobacco, the<br />\nmilder it is.<br />\nIt is a fact, well known by<br />\nleaf tobacco experts, that<br />\nCamels are made from finer, MORE<br />\nEXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other<br />\npopular brand.<br />\nThis is why Camels are so mild.This is why<br />\nCamels have given more pleasure to more<br />\npeople than any other cigarette ever made.<br />\nIt's the secret of Camels'rich\"bouquet\"<br />\n...their cool flavor...their non-irritating<br />\nmildness.<br />\nAll the natural, ripe goodness of Camel's<br />\ntobaeco is keptfresh for you by the famous<br />\nair-tight, welded Humidor Pack.

It is<br />\nthis tobacco which is best for pipes.<br />\nWe found out that Mr. J. N.Wellman,<br />\nmany years ago, made a pipe tobacco<br />\nwhich was very popular. But it was<br />\nnever advertised and after he passed<br />\naway nothing more was heard about it.<br />\nWe acquired this Wellman Method and<br />\nthat is what we use in making Granger.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nC1933<br />\nLIGGETT & MYERS<br />\nTOBACCO CO.<br />\n<br />\nTEN CENTS<br />\n<br />\nNext was the cut.

The secret was unearthed in 1849 by the<br />\ngreat magician, Robert-Houdin. At that time, ether<br />\nhad just been discovered, and little was known<br />\nabout it. Houdin claimed that he had discovered<br />\nthat this new anesthetic could make people light as<br />\nair. To prove it, he caused the subject to rise into<br />\nthe air and float apparently suspended. He passed<br />\na hoop around the body to show there were no<br />\nwires or supports.<br />\nEXPLANATION:<br /><br />\nThere are many, many explanations for this old<br />\ntrick. One is that the girl wears a concealed harness,<br />\nwhich ends in a socket between her shoulder blades.<br />\nThis is attached to a piston below the stage. The<br />\npiston is pushed up from below, causing her to<br />\nrise in the air. The piston is invisible, because it<br />\nis covered with mirrors which reflect surrounding<br />\ndraperies, similar to the background. The magician can pass the hoop over her body because it<br />\nis cut in one place. It can be pulled apart for a<br />\nsecond when it passes the piston.<br />\nMagic\"by Professor Hoffmann.<br />\nGeorge Routledge &amp; Sons.<br /><br />\nSOURCE:\"Modern<br /><br />\nNO TRICKS<br />\n..JUST COSTLIER<br />\nTOBACCOS<br />\nIN A<br /><br />\nIt's fun to be fooled..<br />\nmore fun to KNOW<br />\nAnother \"magic show\" is cigarette advertising.<br />\nOne of its greatest tricks is the illusion<br />\nthat cigarettes can be made miraculously<br />\n\"MILD\" through manufacturing methods.<br />\nTHE EXPLANATION: All popular cigarettes<br />\ntoday are made in modern sanitary factories<br />\nwith up-to-date machinery.

It is<br />\nthis tobacco which is best for pipes.<br />\nWe found out that Mr. J. N.Wellman,<br />\nmany years ago, made a pipe tobacco<br />\nwhich was very popular. But it was<br />\nnever advertised and after he passed<br />\naway nothing more was heard about it.<br />\nWe acquired this Wellman Method and<br />\nthat is what we use in making Granger.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nC1933<br />\nLIGGETT &amp; MYERS<br />\nTOBACCO CO.<br /><br />\nTEN CENTS<br /><br />\nNext was the cut. We knew that fine<br />\ntobacco burnt hot because it burnt so<br />\nfast. You could hardly hold,your pipe in<br />\nyour hand, it got so hot at times. So<br />\nremembering how folks used to \"whittle\"<br />\ntheir tobacco we cut GRANGER just like<br />\n\"whittle\" tobacco \u2014\"Rough Cut.\" It<br />\nsmokes cooler, lasts longer and never<br />\ngums the pipe.<br />\nSo far, so good.
