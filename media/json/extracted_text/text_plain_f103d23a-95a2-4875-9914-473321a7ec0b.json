C. game was true<br />\nHopkins spirit; and the same spirit was evident in most of the men<br />\nwho turned out to root for the team. The trouble is that only a few<br />\ncame<br />\nto the game and the rooting was weak, as compared with that<br />\nV<br />\nV \u2022<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nB. M. C. Not over fifty men showed up in the cheering secV.<br />\nV \u2022<br />\ntion, while the \"Meds.\" came to the game practically in a body.<br />\nThere is not the slightest reason why the Johns Hopkins foot-ball<br />\nV<br />\n\u2022 *******\u2022VVVV \u2022<br />\nteam<br />\ncan not be supported by the University as heartily as are the<br />\n/WWI<br />\nVSPICV*1<br />\nteams<br />\nof other colleges. There is absolutely no excuse why every<br />\nV V V<br />\nundergraduate should not come to every game from now on. We<br />\nhave a field. We have a team. We can have rooters, if they will come out. During the<br />\nremainder of the season there are many important games to be played, and it seems to us that<br />\na team which put up as manly a fight as did ours on the 26th deserves at least the hearty and<br />\nwilling support of every member of the University. At the present writing the game with<br />\nMt. Washington is to be played within a few hours. We trust that the showing made by the<br />\nrooters will compare in spirit with that which will certainly be made by our team. When this<br />\nissue of the NEWS-LETTER appears, the Delaware game will be on hand. Everybody simply<br />\nmust come out and root;\u2014and root hard.<br />\nN another page of this issue we print a short notice of the Cotillon<br />\nClub which is in a measure official since it comes from a member of<br />\nthe committee. We beg leave to say that the NEWS-LETTER did not<br />\nthink \"that the Board of Governors of the Cotillon Club was idle.\"<br />\nThe decision to \"limit the number of the Board to twelve men, as<br />\nthe Board was getting too large,\" fits in fairly well with our views<br />\nas expressed two weeks ago. Altogether the arrangements of the<br />\nBoard for the coming season are satisfactory. The Cotillon Club, as<br />\nevery other interest at the University, should have our hearty support. The dances are on Friday night, so hard-worked students can<br />\nnot plead lessons as an excuse for not coming. Last year all these dances were very delightful and the series this year promises to be equally so.<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nf4S/RV, V, ,Zsii47,-,,4<br />\n<br />\nROM a like \"official source\" we receive an account of the plans of<br />\nthe Musical Clubs which we publish. The announcement that the<br />\nClubs are not to be of the familiar \"cut and dried Glee, Mandl:)V<br />\nV<br />\n,<br />\nv<br />\nlin and Banjo\" style is of interest. There is sure proof of life in<br />\n\u2713<br />\nv<br />\n\u2713<br />\nv.<br />\nany organization which is not content to stick to the same old thing<br />\n\u2713<br />\n*kr<br />\n#v<br />\nyear-in and year-out, but which is willing to experiment. If such<br />\n*<br />\n\u2713<br />\n\u2713<br />\nv<br />\nan experiment succeeds, theirs is the credit. If it fails, they have,<br />\n*<br />\ne'\u2022. v<br />\nv**itiotoo*gs \u2022<br />\nat least, the old style to fall back on. But if interest is shown in the<br />\nV V<br />\nMusical Clubs\u2014and we hear the number of men \"out for the Clubs\"<br />\nIan<br />\nis very promising\u2014there can be no rumor of failure. Of course<br />\nthere are kickers,\u2014like the poor, they are with us always. But the best way to kill the<br />\nkickers is to show them they have no excuse for living, and the success of the new plans of<br />\nthe Musical Clubs will demonstrate that.<br />\n\u2713<br />\n<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nINCE the editorial concerning foot-ball on the opposite page was put<br />\nin type, we have received the news of the Mt.

They are not only fine poetry, but<br />\nfairly accurate, if a little extravagant, criticisru<br />\nas well. The sonnet on Webster is magnificent, as are the opening lines of that on Marlows:<br />\n<br />\nmore\" before being punished.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014Unlike Swinburne, Rossetti<br />\nhad no liking at all for any of Shakespeare's<br />\nfellow-dramatists.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014That's true, and hardly strange,<br />\nsince the limits of Rossetti's powers of appreciation were narrower than those of his fellow-poet. Bernard Shaw, that second-class<br />\nposeur, has recently endeavored to \"run down\"<br />\nthe Elizabethans, and, where five hundred<br />\npeople have read \"Man and Superman,\" and<br />\n\"Mrs. Warren's Profession,\" barely one<br />\n\"Crowned, girdled, garbed and shod with light and knows and loves such masterpieces as \"Philasfire,<br />\nter,\" or \"The Duchess of Malfi,\" or \"The AlSun, first-born of the morning, sovereign star.\"<br />\nchemist.\"<br />\nThe Reader\u2014That is magnificent, isn't it?<br />\nThe Reader\u2014Is \"loves\" the proper way to<br />\nAnd how well it describes Marlowe! I love describe one's feelings towards any of Jonhim\u2014at least, in parts\u2014for nothing is more son's plays? I, for one, agree with Mr. Howtedious than parts of `T'amburlaine.\"<br />\nells when he says Ben Jonson was never so<br />\nThe Critic\u2014And some parts\u2014such as the \"rare\" in life as in death.<br />\nlovely apostrophe to beauty\u2014are at the very<br />\nThe Critic\u2014Perhaps you are right. I do<br />\nsummit of English poetry. But it is in \"Faus- not love \"The Alchemist,\" though I am amazed<br />\ntus\" that his genius reaches its sublimest at its subtlety and am amused by the humor of<br />\nheights. In spite of the coarseness of the it. Still, I think Howells is wrong in insinuatcomic scenes, or rather in direct and inten- ing that Jonson's epitaph is undeserved. Pertional contrast to them, the picture of the haps his dramas are not \"rare\" (some people<br />\ndeath struggle of Faustus with the devil is may be glad they are so); but remember it<br />\npresented with terrible power and in match- was he who wrote the divine \"To Celia.\"<br />\nless verse. There is an intense loveliness in<br />\nThe Reader\u2014You mean \"Drink to Me Only<br />\nthe lines to Helen. You,of course; know them. With Thine Eyes,\" don't you?<br />\nThe Reader\u2014Know them! I know them by<br />\nThe Critic\u2014Certainly.

I<br />\nnoticed myself in Westminster Abbey the<br />\nname is spelt \"Johnson.\"<br />\nThe Reader\u2014Indeed. It's strange no one<br />\nhas called attention to it. Speaking just now<br />\nof \"Dr. Faustus\" reminds me that Stephen<br />\nPhillips is writing a tragedy on the subject.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014Yes,I have heard so, and I don't<br />\nknow whether anxiety or pleasure predominates in my feelings as I look forward to its<br />\npublication. It is really a fearful undertaking,<br />\nbut I believe the author of \"Paola and Francesca\" can make a fine \"stage play\" clothed<br />\nupon with exquisite verse from the material<br />\nwhich resulted in Marlowe's hands in a mingling of radiance and rubbish, and in Goethe's<br />\nin an enormous philosophical poem. At all<br />\nevents, the comparison between the work of<br />\nthe two British poets will be of interest. Some<br />\nyear or so ago I was interested in the resemblance between Mr. Phillip's \"Nero\" and the<br />\nanonymous Jacobean play of the same name.<br />\nPhillips does not suffer in comparison, though<br />\n\"Nero\" is certainly the poorest of his dramas.<br />\nHowever, it contains much good verse, such as<br />\nthe description of Poppaza<br />\n\"Yet hath none fairer strayed into the world,<br />\nNor wandered in more witchery through the air;<br />\nSince she who drew the keels of Greece<br />\nAfter her over the Ionian foam.\"<br />\n<br />\nNo pre-Keatsian poet could have written<br />\nthat. And yet it is not imitation, but an evidence of the poet's natural lineage from the<br />\nmaster.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014And what a master! Surely,<br />\nthere is no poem like \"The Nightingale\" in the<br />\nlanguage.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014No; to use a slang expression,<br />\nit and the \"Grecian Urn\" are in a class by<br />\nthemselves. There is a white heat of imagination in \"The Nightingale.\"<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n\"Give to the nightingale her shady woods,<br />\nA privacy of glorious light is thine!\"<br />\n<br />\nThus Wordsworth addresses the skylark,<br />\nand yet the \"se f-same song\" of the nightingale,<br />\n\"Found a path<br />\nThrough the . sad heart of Ruth when, sick for home,<br />\nShe stood in tears amidst the alien corn,<br />\nThe same that ofttimes bath<br />\nCharmed magic casements opening on the foam<br />\nOf perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe imagination of this is delicious.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014But Phillips has almost as<br />\nmuch claim to Tennyson as his master as to<br />\nKeats.<br />\nThe Crtic \u2014Yes; \"Marpessa,\" which is<br />\nprobably his most widely known poem, does<br />\nresemble Tennyson's classic studies, more in<br />\nsubject and treatment, however, than in actual<br />\nform. The priceless \"faint Homeric echoes\"<br />\nare not there. In its places there is verse less<br />\ngrand, though not less beautiful; less lofty,<br />\nbut just as pure.<br />\n\"Thy voice is like to music heard in birth,<br />\nSome spirit lute touched on a spirit sea ;<br />\nThy face remembered is from other worlds,<br />\nit has been died for, though T know not when;<br />\nIt has been sung of, though I know not where,<br />\nIt has the strangeness of the luring west,<br />\nAnd of sad sea horizons ; beside thee<br />\nI am aware of other times and lands,<br />\nOf births far back, of lives in many stars,<br />\n0 beauty, lone, and like a candle clear<br />\nIn this dark country of the world!\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Reader\u2014You quoted a couple of lines<br />\nfrom Wordsworth awhile ago\u2014from the marvelous lines to a skylark. I wish I appreciated<br />\nWordsworth more. I feel as if a certain and<br />\nnecessary catholicity of taste in matters literary was wanting in me because I find \"The<br />\nExcursion\" very, very dull.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014I suppose I should be ashamed<br />\nof myself, but I fear I agree with you. I love<br />\nWordsworth, but I love him mainly for half<br />\na dozen sonnets and three or four perfect<br />\npoems. No less a critic than Matthew Arnold<br />\nhas said that \"Laodamia\" and the \"Intimations of Immortality\" did not represent his<br />\nbest work. Doubtless, Arnold was right. He<br />\nought to know. But I think they are incomparably his greatest poems. Arnold criticises<br />\na certain artificiality in \"Laodamia\" and the<br />\ndeclamatory style of the \"Immortal Ode,\" as<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Furness has called it. Maybe he is<br />\nright. Certainly the last verse of the<br />\nclassic poem \u2014 that describing how the<br />\ntrees withered when they were tall enough to<br />\nsec the \"topless towers of Ilium\"\u2014is artificial,<br />\nbut in some stanzas, notably two, all trace of<br />\nartificiality is lost. I say \"notably two.\" I<br />\nmean, of course:<br />\n\"He spake of love, such love as spirits feel,<br />\nIn worlds whose course is equable and pure;<br />\nNo cares to heat away, no strifes to heal,<br />\nThe past unsighed for and the future sure.<br />\nSpake as a witness of a second birth,<br />\nFor all that is most perfect upon earth.<br />\nFor all that is most beauteous imagined there<br />\nIn happier beauty, more pellucid streams<br />\nAn ampler ether, a diviner air,<br />\nAnd fields invested with purpureal gleams<br />\nClimes which the sun who sheds the brightest day<br />\nEarth knows, is all unworthy to survey.\"<br />\n<br />\nAs you probably know, the poet altered the<br />\nlast two lines of the stanzas first quoted to :<br />\n\"Spake of heroic arts in graver mood,<br />\nRevived, with finer harmony pursued.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe alteration is lamentable.<br />\nAs for the great \"Ode,\" it may tend a trifle<br />\nto declamation at times, but at its best it is<br />\nglorious.<br />\n\"Not in entire forgetfulness,<br />\nNor yet in utter nakedness,<br />\nBut trailing clouds of glory do we come,<br />\nFrom God, who is our home.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Reader\u2014To go back again, that same<br />\nquotation you made from Wordsworth's<br />\n\"Skylark\" reminds me of one of my favorite<br />\npoems\u2014Shelly's ode to the same \"blithe spirit.\"<br />\nThe Critic\u2014Ali, what a genius that man<br />\nwas!<br />\n\"In the golden lightning<br />\nOf the sunken sun,<br />\nO'er which clouds are brightening,<br />\nThou (lost float and run,<br />\nLike an unbodied joy whose race has just<br />\nbegun.\"<br />\n<br />\nGeorge Meredith has also written a poem on<br />\na Skylark. But, for the wonder of his novels, I<br />\nhave sometimes thought it were a pity he had<br />\nnot given his life to poetry. I do not care for<br />\nhis later verse, but \"Love in the Valley,\" with<br />\nits fresh, perfumed morning beauty, is graceful and delicate and worthy of the author of<br />\nthe two chapters on Richard's early love for<br />\nLucy, in \"Feverel\":<br />\n<br />\n\"She whom I love is hard to catch and conquer;<br />\nHard, but 0 the glory of the winning were she won.\"<br />\n<br />\nMight not those lines be the guiding motto<br />\nof many a man ?<br />\nOf a very different sort is \"Modern Love.\"<br />\nIt has always been too sad, too morbid, for<br />\nmy taste, save one sonnet only\u2014that of the<br />\nmomentary reconciliation of husband and wife<br />\nby the \"twilight wave,\" under the flight of the<br />\nswallows:<br />\n\"Love, that had robbed us of immortal things,<br />\n. This little moment mercifully gave,<br />\nAnd still I see across the twilight wave<br />\nThe swan sail with her young beneath her wings.\"<br />\n<br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nAt the meeting of the Glee Club last week<br />\nthe leader proposed a new plan, which was accordingly adopted. Although it is something<br />\nentirely new for Hopkins, it has been carried<br />\nout with great success by several other colleges. Their plan is this: Instead of coming<br />\nout in the same old way, first the Glee Club<br />\nand then the Mandolin Club, both of the clubs<br />\nwill be seated on the stage during the entire<br />\nperformance. There will be an opening<br />\nchorus, after which the end men will get off<br />\na few good jokes, and the program will be<br />\ncontinued in more or less the usual manner.<br />\nThere will be selections by the Mandolin Club<br />\nand by the Glee Club. The selections by the<br />\n(flee Club will be sung in parts, as usual, but<br />\nhesides these there will be several solos of popular songs, in the choruses, of which the Glee<br />\nClub will join, singing in unison. This plan,<br />\nwhich may not seem at first to be a wise one,<br />\nhas, nevertheless, many good points. In the<br />\nfirst place, the fellows will work harder and<br />\ntake more interest in the popular songs than<br />\nthey would if they had to be drilled in parts.<br />\nThis program can be gotten ready in a shorter<br />\ntime, which is absolutely necessary this year.<br />\nThis performance is not to be called a minstrel<br />\nshow, as several have already termed it, and<br />\nit will not cheapen the clubs in any way, as<br />\nsome few seem to think, as there will be no<br />\n\"stunts\" performed and the jokes will be good,<br />\nclean jokes. We expect to hear of several objections to this new plan, but we are prepared<br />\nto meet all that could be said against it. It is<br />\nwell worth trying, and if it is not successful<br />\nwe shall be able to fall back on the cut and<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ndried form of Glee Club performances. We<br />\nexpect to give at the Baltimore and Washington concerts the regular style of musical clubs'<br />\nentertainment. We hope that our new plan<br />\nwill meet with the approval of all.

We take pleasure<br />\nin announcing the election of \\Ir. Richard<br />\nTilghman as President and of M r. Streett as<br />\nSecretary and Treasurer.

The dates for the dances<br />\nhave been definitely fixed. The first dance<br />\nwill be on Friday, December 6, which is only<br />\none month off.

C. game was true<br />\nHopkins spirit; and the same spirit was evident in most of the men<br />\nwho turned out to root for the team. The trouble is that only a few<br />\ncame<br />\nto the game and the rooting was weak, as compared with that<br />\nV<br />\nV \u2022<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nB. M. C. Not over fifty men showed up in the cheering secV.<br />\nV \u2022<br />\ntion, while the \"Meds.\" came to the game practically in a body.<br />\nThere is not the slightest reason why the Johns Hopkins foot-ball<br />\nV<br />\n\u2022 *******\u2022VVVV \u2022<br />\nteam<br />\ncan not be supported by the University as heartily as are the<br />\n/WWI<br />\nVSPICV*1<br />\nteams<br />\nof other colleges. There is absolutely no excuse why every<br />\nV V V<br />\nundergraduate should not come to every game from now on. We<br />\nhave a field. We have a team. We can have rooters, if they will come out. During the<br />\nremainder of the season there are many important games to be played, and it seems to us that<br />\na team which put up as manly a fight as did ours on the 26th deserves at least the hearty and<br />\nwilling support of every member of the University. At the present writing the game with<br />\nMt. Washington is to be played within a few hours. We trust that the showing made by the<br />\nrooters will compare in spirit with that which will certainly be made by our team. When this<br />\nissue of the NEWS-LETTER appears, the Delaware game will be on hand. Everybody simply<br />\nmust come out and root;\u2014and root hard.<br />\nN another page of this issue we print a short notice of the Cotillon<br />\nClub which is in a measure official since it comes from a member of<br />\nthe committee. We beg leave to say that the NEWS-LETTER did not<br />\nthink \"that the Board of Governors of the Cotillon Club was idle.\"<br />\nThe decision to \"limit the number of the Board to twelve men, as<br />\nthe Board was getting too large,\" fits in fairly well with our views<br />\nas expressed two weeks ago. Altogether the arrangements of the<br />\nBoard for the coming season are satisfactory. The Cotillon Club, as<br />\nevery other interest at the University, should have our hearty support. The dances are on Friday night, so hard-worked students can<br />\nnot plead lessons as an excuse for not coming. Last year all these dances were very delightful and the series this year promises to be equally so.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nf4S/RV, V, ,Zsii47,-,,4<br /><br />\nROM a like \"official source\" we receive an account of the plans of<br />\nthe Musical Clubs which we publish. The announcement that the<br />\nClubs are not to be of the familiar \"cut and dried Glee, Mandl:)V<br />\nV<br />\n,<br />\nv<br />\nlin and Banjo\" style is of interest. There is sure proof of life in<br />\n\u2713<br />\nv<br />\n\u2713<br />\nv.<br />\nany organization which is not content to stick to the same old thing<br />\n\u2713<br />\n*kr<br />\n#v<br />\nyear-in and year-out, but which is willing to experiment. If such<br />\n*<br />\n\u2713<br />\n\u2713<br />\nv<br />\nan experiment succeeds, theirs is the credit. If it fails, they have,<br />\n*<br />\ne'\u2022. v<br />\nv**itiotoo*gs \u2022<br />\nat least, the old style to fall back on. But if interest is shown in the<br />\nV V<br />\nMusical Clubs\u2014and we hear the number of men \"out for the Clubs\"<br />\nIan<br />\nis very promising\u2014there can be no rumor of failure. Of course<br />\nthere are kickers,\u2014like the poor, they are with us always. But the best way to kill the<br />\nkickers is to show them they have no excuse for living, and the success of the new plans of<br />\nthe Musical Clubs will demonstrate that.<br />\n\u2713<br /><br />\nV<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nINCE the editorial concerning foot-ball on the opposite page was put<br />\nin type, we have received the news of the Mt. Washington game.<br />\nnoVulu<br />\nU<br />\nFB<br />\nThe result was not really a surprise.

They are not only fine poetry, but<br />\nfairly accurate, if a little extravagant, criticisru<br />\nas well. The sonnet on Webster is magnificent, as are the opening lines of that on Marlows:<br /><br />\nmore\" before being punished.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014Unlike Swinburne, Rossetti<br />\nhad no liking at all for any of Shakespeare's<br />\nfellow-dramatists.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014That's true, and hardly strange,<br />\nsince the limits of Rossetti's powers of appreciation were narrower than those of his fellow-poet. Bernard Shaw, that second-class<br />\nposeur, has recently endeavored to \"run down\"<br />\nthe Elizabethans, and, where five hundred<br />\npeople have read \"Man and Superman,\" and<br />\n\"Mrs. Warren's Profession,\" barely one<br />\n\"Crowned, girdled, garbed and shod with light and knows and loves such masterpieces as \"Philasfire,<br />\nter,\" or \"The Duchess of Malfi,\" or \"The AlSun, first-born of the morning, sovereign star.\"<br />\nchemist.\"<br />\nThe Reader\u2014That is magnificent, isn't it?<br />\nThe Reader\u2014Is \"loves\" the proper way to<br />\nAnd how well it describes Marlowe!

In spite of the coarseness of the it. Still, I think Howells is wrong in insinuatcomic scenes, or rather in direct and inten- ing that Jonson's epitaph is undeserved. Pertional contrast to them, the picture of the haps his dramas are not \"rare\" (some people<br />\ndeath struggle of Faustus with the devil is may be glad they are so); but remember it<br />\npresented with terrible power and in match- was he who wrote the divine \"To Celia.\"<br />\nless verse.

I<br />\nnoticed myself in Westminster Abbey the<br />\nname is spelt \"Johnson.\"<br />\nThe Reader\u2014Indeed. It's strange no one<br />\nhas called attention to it. Speaking just now<br />\nof \"Dr. Faustus\" reminds me that Stephen<br />\nPhillips is writing a tragedy on the subject.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014Yes,I have heard so, and I don't<br />\nknow whether anxiety or pleasure predominates in my feelings as I look forward to its<br />\npublication. It is really a fearful undertaking,<br />\nbut I believe the author of \"Paola and Francesca\" can make a fine \"stage play\" clothed<br />\nupon with exquisite verse from the material<br />\nwhich resulted in Marlowe's hands in a mingling of radiance and rubbish, and in Goethe's<br />\nin an enormous philosophical poem. At all<br />\nevents, the comparison between the work of<br />\nthe two British poets will be of interest. Some<br />\nyear or so ago I was interested in the resemblance between Mr. Phillip's \"Nero\" and the<br />\nanonymous Jacobean play of the same name.<br />\nPhillips does not suffer in comparison, though<br />\n\"Nero\" is certainly the poorest of his dramas.<br />\nHowever, it contains much good verse, such as<br />\nthe description of Poppaza<br />\n\"Yet hath none fairer strayed into the world,<br />\nNor wandered in more witchery through the air;<br />\nSince she who drew the keels of Greece<br />\nAfter her over the Ionian foam.\"<br /><br />\nNo pre-Keatsian poet could have written<br />\nthat. And yet it is not imitation, but an evidence of the poet's natural lineage from the<br />\nmaster.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014And what a master! Surely,<br />\nthere is no poem like \"The Nightingale\" in the<br />\nlanguage.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014No; to use a slang expression,<br />\nit and the \"Grecian Urn\" are in a class by<br />\nthemselves. There is a white heat of imagination in \"The Nightingale.\"<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n\"Give to the nightingale her shady woods,<br />\nA privacy of glorious light is thine!\"<br /><br />\nThus Wordsworth addresses the skylark,<br />\nand yet the \"se f-same song\" of the nightingale,<br />\n\"Found a path<br />\nThrough the . sad heart of Ruth when, sick for home,<br />\nShe stood in tears amidst the alien corn,<br />\nThe same that ofttimes bath<br />\nCharmed magic casements opening on the foam<br />\nOf perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn.\"<br /><br />\nThe imagination of this is delicious.<br />\nThe Reader\u2014But Phillips has almost as<br />\nmuch claim to Tennyson as his master as to<br />\nKeats.<br />\nThe Crtic \u2014Yes; \"Marpessa,\" which is<br />\nprobably his most widely known poem, does<br />\nresemble Tennyson's classic studies, more in<br />\nsubject and treatment, however, than in actual<br />\nform. The priceless \"faint Homeric echoes\"<br />\nare not there. In its places there is verse less<br />\ngrand, though not less beautiful; less lofty,<br />\nbut just as pure.<br />\n\"Thy voice is like to music heard in birth,<br />\nSome spirit lute touched on a spirit sea ;<br />\nThy face remembered is from other worlds,<br />\nit has been died for, though T know not when;<br />\nIt has been sung of, though I know not where,<br />\nIt has the strangeness of the luring west,<br />\nAnd of sad sea horizons ; beside thee<br />\nI am aware of other times and lands,<br />\nOf births far back, of lives in many stars,<br />\n0 beauty, lone, and like a candle clear<br />\nIn this dark country of the world!\"<br /><br />\nThe Reader\u2014You quoted a couple of lines<br />\nfrom Wordsworth awhile ago\u2014from the marvelous lines to a skylark. I wish I appreciated<br />\nWordsworth more. I feel as if a certain and<br />\nnecessary catholicity of taste in matters literary was wanting in me because I find \"The<br />\nExcursion\" very, very dull.<br />\nThe Critic\u2014I suppose I should be ashamed<br />\nof myself, but I fear I agree with you. I love<br />\nWordsworth, but I love him mainly for half<br />\na dozen sonnets and three or four perfect<br />\npoems. No less a critic than Matthew Arnold<br />\nhas said that \"Laodamia\" and the \"Intimations of Immortality\" did not represent his<br />\nbest work. Doubtless, Arnold was right. He<br />\nought to know. But I think they are incomparably his greatest poems. Arnold criticises<br />\na certain artificiality in \"Laodamia\" and the<br />\ndeclamatory style of the \"Immortal Ode,\" as<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nDr. Furness has called it. Maybe he is<br />\nright. Certainly the last verse of the<br />\nclassic poem \u2014 that describing how the<br />\ntrees withered when they were tall enough to<br />\nsec the \"topless towers of Ilium\"\u2014is artificial,<br />\nbut in some stanzas, notably two, all trace of<br />\nartificiality is lost. I say \"notably two.\" I<br />\nmean, of course:<br />\n\"He spake of love, such love as spirits feel,<br />\nIn worlds whose course is equable and pure;<br />\nNo cares to heat away, no strifes to heal,<br />\nThe past unsighed for and the future sure.<br />\nSpake as a witness of a second birth,<br />\nFor all that is most perfect upon earth.<br />\nFor all that is most beauteous imagined there<br />\nIn happier beauty, more pellucid streams<br />\nAn ampler ether, a diviner air,<br />\nAnd fields invested with purpureal gleams<br />\nClimes which the sun who sheds the brightest day<br />\nEarth knows, is all unworthy to survey.\"<br /><br />\nAs you probably know, the poet altered the<br />\nlast two lines of the stanzas first quoted to :<br />\n\"Spake of heroic arts in graver mood,<br />\nRevived, with finer harmony pursued.\"<br /><br />\nThe alteration is lamentable.<br />\nAs for the great \"Ode,\" it may tend a trifle<br />\nto declamation at times, but at its best it is<br />\nglorious.<br />\n\"Not in entire forgetfulness,<br />\nNor yet in utter nakedness,<br />\nBut trailing clouds of glory do we come,<br />\nFrom God, who is our home.\"<br /><br />\nThe Reader\u2014To go back again, that same<br />\nquotation you made from Wordsworth's<br />\n\"Skylark\" reminds me of one of my favorite<br />\npoems\u2014Shelly's ode to the same \"blithe spirit.\"<br />\nThe Critic\u2014Ali, what a genius that man<br />\nwas!<br />\n\"In the golden lightning<br />\nOf the sunken sun,<br />\nO'er which clouds are brightening,<br />\nThou (lost float and run,<br />\nLike an unbodied joy whose race has just<br />\nbegun.\"<br /><br />\nGeorge Meredith has also written a poem on<br />\na Skylark. But, for the wonder of his novels, I<br />\nhave sometimes thought it were a pity he had<br />\nnot given his life to poetry. I do not care for<br />\nhis later verse, but \"Love in the Valley,\" with<br />\nits fresh, perfumed morning beauty, is graceful and delicate and worthy of the author of<br />\nthe two chapters on Richard's early love for<br />\nLucy, in \"Feverel\":<br /><br />\n\"She whom I love is hard to catch and conquer;<br />\nHard, but 0 the glory of the winning were she won.\"<br /><br />\nMight not those lines be the guiding motto<br />\nof many a man ?<br />\nOf a very different sort is \"Modern Love.\"<br />\nIt has always been too sad, too morbid, for<br />\nmy taste, save one sonnet only\u2014that of the<br />\nmomentary reconciliation of husband and wife<br />\nby the \"twilight wave,\" under the flight of the<br />\nswallows:<br />\n\"Love, that had robbed us of immortal things,<br />\n. This little moment mercifully gave,<br />\nAnd still I see across the twilight wave<br />\nThe swan sail with her young beneath her wings.\"<br /><br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nAt the meeting of the Glee Club last week<br />\nthe leader proposed a new plan, which was accordingly adopted. Although it is something<br />\nentirely new for Hopkins, it has been carried<br />\nout with great success by several other colleges. Their plan is this: Instead of coming<br />\nout in the same old way, first the Glee Club<br />\nand then the Mandolin Club, both of the clubs<br />\nwill be seated on the stage during the entire<br />\nperformance. There will be an opening<br />\nchorus, after which the end men will get off<br />\na few good jokes, and the program will be<br />\ncontinued in more or less the usual manner.<br />\nThere will be selections by the Mandolin Club<br />\nand by the Glee Club. The selections by the<br />\n(flee Club will be sung in parts, as usual, but<br />\nhesides these there will be several solos of popular songs, in the choruses, of which the Glee<br />\nClub will join, singing in unison. This plan,<br />\nwhich may not seem at first to be a wise one,<br />\nhas, nevertheless, many good points. In the<br />\nfirst place, the fellows will work harder and<br />\ntake more interest in the popular songs than<br />\nthey would if they had to be drilled in parts.<br />\nThis program can be gotten ready in a shorter<br />\ntime, which is absolutely necessary this year.<br />\nThis performance is not to be called a minstrel<br />\nshow, as several have already termed it, and<br />\nit will not cheapen the clubs in any way, as<br />\nsome few seem to think, as there will be no<br />\n\"stunts\" performed and the jokes will be good,<br />\nclean jokes. We expect to hear of several objections to this new plan, but we are prepared<br />\nto meet all that could be said against it. It is<br />\nwell worth trying, and if it is not successful<br />\nwe shall be able to fall back on the cut and<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ndried form of Glee Club performances. We<br />\nexpect to give at the Baltimore and Washington concerts the regular style of musical clubs'<br />\nentertainment. We hope that our new plan<br />\nwill meet with the approval of all. If everyone comes to the Medical School concert they<br />\nwill have a chance to criticise the clubs, and<br />\nwe think that all the criticisms will be favorable.<br /><br />\nCOTILLON CLUB.<br />\nAlthough the NEws-LETTER thought that<br />\nthe Board of Governors of the Cotillon Club<br />\nwas idle, such was not the case, for before the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER came out the Board of Governors had held its first meeting and elected<br />\nnew officers and members. We take pleasure<br />\nin announcing the election of \\Ir. Richard<br />\nTilghman as President and of M r. Streett as<br />\nSecretary and Treasurer.

J. Smith, Mr. D. Stewart.<br />\nIt was also decided to limit the number of<br />\nthe Board to twelve men, as the Board was<br />\ngetting too large.<br />\nAt a meeting of the loard last week it was<br />\ndecided to give only three dances this year,<br />\nand to make them really first class, instead<br />\nof trying to give four dances which would<br />\nwould not be so good. We think this is a<br />\nvery wise plan, and we are already at work<br />\ntrying to make the dances the best that have<br />\never been given. The dates for the dances<br />\nhave been definitely fixed. The first dance<br />\nwill be on Friday, December 6, which is only<br />\none month off. The other two dances will be<br />\non Friday, January 31, and Friday, April 24.<br />\nIt is hoped that the dances will be largely attended this season.<br /><br />\nEXCHANGES.<br />\nhas not, as yet, received<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\nThe<br />\nmany publications, but of those which have<br />\nso far appeared The North7k,estern Magazine<br />\nis undoubtedly the best.
