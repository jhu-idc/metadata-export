Mrs. Gertrude Onnen, who took the sole<br />\npart in the sketch, distinguished<br />\nherself as an actress carrying the<br />\nentire audience with her. As a<br />\nblase sophisticate, she captivated<br />\nher audience, and carried them alternately from the comic to the<br />\ndepths of despair. The plot of the<br />\nmonologue concerns her love and<br />\nfaithfulness for a certain army official who has been away for 20<br />\nyears.
