There is, however,<br />\none point which hurts a bit, if you<br />\ndon't mind my saying so, and that<br />\nis that your reviewer, who apparently knows me, should have made the<br />\nmistake of all the others and identified me with Francis Harper. The<br />\nbook is not an autobiography and<br />\nnone of the characters are portraits<br />\nof the author. Moreover, Oralia<br />\nis no place on earth that I know of<br />\nbut a combination of many places.<br />\nI make these remarks' because now<br />\nas in the past there has been too<br />\nmuch talk about the originals in my<br />\nstories and too little about the stories themselves. There is a certain<br />\nexcuse for this, even in the present<br />\nease, but there are excuses for almost everything.
