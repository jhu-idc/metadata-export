There is<br />\nvery little, if any, feeling of belonging to a community<br />\namongst those who reside in them.<br />\nThis morning the Hopkins' film \"The University\" stated<br />\nthrough the words of John Masefield, one of the prime functions of a university. This is to \"give the young people that<br />\nclose companionship for which youth longs ... and that<br />\nchance of the endless discussion of the themes which are<br />\nendless ... without which youth would seem a waste of<br />\ntime.\" Although this vital spirit of companionship is not<br />\ntotally wanting in the dorms, it is effectively suppressed.<br />\nThe residency is divided in an amazingly thorough manner. Fraternity men tend to be at least socially separated<br />\nfrom independents. Engineers are curricularly separated<br />\nfrom men in the school of Arts and Sciences. To a lesser<br />\ndegree, the classes are separated, merely through associations. The house system, whereby the dormitories are divided<br />\ninto separate entries was originally planned to promote<br />\na strong unity of subdivisions. However, in its present<br />\nstatus, the system encourages the isolation of cliques rather<br />\nthan the desired unity of medium sized groups.<br />\nBy themselves, none of these separations are final<br />\nenough to cause the sense of disunity to be present. The<br />\nisolation factor is this: although there are several points<br />\nat which the interest and activities of the residents of the<br />\ndormitory differ, there is no encouragement for a union of<br />\nthe various factors, nor is there any obvious advantage in<br />\nsuch a union. There is no common ground for an amalgamation.<br />\nThe dormitory resident needs to feel that he belongs<br />\nto more than his immediate circle of friends if the previously stated goal of the university is to be fulfilled. He<br />\nneeds a place, and above all, a reason to break his cliques.<br />\nAt the present time there is no situation or location conducive to informal discussions between non-acquainted dormitory residents. The provision of a room for such purposes<br />\nwould not be sufficient; indeed, there are ample facilities<br />\navailable at present.<br />\nPerhaps a suggestion could be taken from \"The University,\" which depicted a. member of the faculty mingling<br />\nwith dormitory student in what is loosely termed a bull<br />\nsession. If student-faculty discussions such as this actually<br />\ndid take place in the dormitories, a step would be taken in<br />\nthe provision of an opyortunity to discuss \"the themes<br />\nwhich are endless.\" An arrangement in the order of the<br />\n'Y' Coffee Hours in the dormitories might suffice for a<br />\nbeginning.<br />\nAnother serious oversight in planning a well-rounded<br />\ndormitory life is the lack of an effective social program.<br />\nThere is no provision for an informal mixing of the sees.<br />\nWith the exception of the few, and only partially effective,<br />\nmixers, all acquaintances are made off campus. It would<br />\nnot be impossible for the less aggressive 'resident of the<br />\nAlumni Memorial Residences to go throughout the academic<br />\nyear without more than a passing acquaintance with the<br />\nopposite sex.<br />\nSince it is impossible for the four year student to have<br />\na complete understanding of a situation which has built .up<br />\nover a period of years, without direct knowledge of what<br />\nthe past held, or of what possibilities of improvement may<br />\nexist, we feel that it is not the part of the student to attempt to ameliorate the present oppressive atmosphere in<br />\nthe dormitories.

Maryland, as expected,<br />\nhas dominated the collegiate lacrosse scene this year, winning<br />\n10 straight contests and adding to their consecutive game<br />\nstreak which has now reached 22 in a row. The streak,<br />\nironically enough, began on Homecoming Day in 1954<br />\nWhen the Terps massacred Hopkins by a 17-4 score. From<br />\nthis corner, this would be just as good a time as any to break<br />\nthe Maryland bubble. Whether the Jaks have the club that<br />\ncan do it or not remains the burning question. Hopkins this<br />\nyear has had its best season since the 1950 championship<br />\nteam. After dropping their first two tilts by one-goal margins, the Jays found themselves and, despite a severe lack<br />\nof fan support in their next four games, whipped all four<br />\nOpponents, including highly rated Army. After beating Army<br />\nthe Jays returned home to face R.P.I. in a game which saw<br />\none of the biggest crowds of the season turn out. The fans<br />\nwere treated to a marvelous game, the Jays coming back<br />\nfrom a four goal deficit to whip Rensselaer, 10-7. Last week<br />\nHopkins capped their six-game streak by upsetting Navy<br />\nby an 8-6 count.<br />\n<br />\nMaryland, who will carry a 22<br />\ngame winning streak into tomorrow's fray, are led by their two<br />\nco-captains, Gruder Miller, attackman, and Jack Simmons, defenseman. The visitors will also<br />\nbring with them their two leading<br />\nscorers, Jim Keating and Charlie<br />\nWicker, who will pose a definite<br />\nthreat to the Hopkins defense.<br />\nTerps Hold Edge<br />\nStatistically the Terps hold the<br />\nedge. In ten games the champs<br />\nhave averaged 15.1 goals per game<br />\noffensively, while holding their op-<br />\n<br />\nponents to a mean of 4.6 goals.<br />\nThe Jays possess an 8.5 average<br />\noffensively and hold a 5 goal average defensively.<br />\nBoth teams have several reasons<br />\nfor wanting to capture a victory<br />\ntomorrow. Hopkins hopes to extend their winning streak to seven<br />\ngames; gain second place in the<br />\nfinal Cy Miller division and national rankings; end the long<br />\nTerp winning streak that was<br />\nstarted two years ago at the Jays'<br />\nexpense and win their first Homecoming since 1951.<br />\n<br />\nArlyn Marshall, Jay Co-captain, brings the ball upfield in an<br />\nintra-squad game as the Jays prepare for tomorrow's clash with<br />\nMaryland. Marshall paces the Hopkins scorers with a total of 17<br />\ngoals in eight games. Arlyn will be playing his final game as a Jay<br />\ntomorrow.<br />\n<br />\nTerps Lead Series<br />\nMaryland, on the other hand,<br />\nwants to make their championship unanimous and finish its second undefeated season; extend its<br />\n18-17-1 series lead over Hopkins<br />\nand keep its 22 game win streak<br />\nintact.<br />\nHopkins coach, Bob Scott commented, \"We are in a good position since we will go into the<br />\ngame as underdogs. We have<br />\neverything to gain and little to<br />\nlose. We feel no pressure, but I<br />\nam sure that the boys would like<br />\nto finish the season with a flourish<br />\nby topping Maryland. The boys<br />\nwill have to give their top effort<br />\nto win this game, since they all<br />\nrealize the strength of this Maryland team.\"<br />\nLast year the Terps downed the<br />\nJays by a 11-5 count after being<br />\nheld to a 5-5 tie after three quarters.<br />\nJays Top Navy<br />\nRallying to score six times In<br />\nthe second half, the Hopkins lacrosse squad scored an 8-6 triumph over Navy at Annapolis before 3,000 fans last Saturday.<br />\nThis victory extended the Jay<br />\nwinning streak to six in a row, the<br />\nlongest Hopkins win skein since<br />\n1950, and gave the Jays their first<br />\nvictory over the Tars since 1951.<br />\nIt also marked the third consecutive week that the Jays have<br />\ncome from behind to capture a<br />\ntriumph.<br />\n(Continued on Pape 8)<br />\n<br />\nHoping to gain their first<br />\nHomecoming Day victory since<br />\n1951 and to end the current collegiate campaign on a successful<br />\nnote, the Blue Jay stickmen face<br />\nthe 1956 National Lacrosse Champions, Maryland, tomorrow at<br />\nHomewood Field at 2:30 p.m.<br />\nLast Saturday the Jays as.sured<br />\nthe Terps of their second straight<br />\ntitle by beating second, place Navy<br />\nby an 8-6 score at Annapolis.<br />\n<br />\nTerps Undefeated<br />\n<br />\nMaryland, on the other hand, has rolled over ten straight<br />\nopponents, compiling a total of 151 goals along the way, an<br />\naverage of fifteen per game. The Terp lineup is dotted with<br />\nAll-Americans and this group is led by Charlie Wicker who<br />\nhas run up the fantastic total of 20 goals and 43 assists<br />\nthis season. Jim Keating has added 24 goals to the Maryland cause.<br />\nHowever, it has been proven countless times that no<br />\nteam, not even the mighty Maryland, is invincible. The Terps<br />\ncan be beaten and Maryland has met no team this year more<br />\ncapable of doing it than Hopkins.<br />\nFrosh Vs. Varsity<br />\n<br />\nWhile we are on the subject of lacrosse we'd like to add<br />\na word about the freshman team. In the early part of the<br />\nseason, many Hopkins lacrosse fans were shifting their<br />\nallegiance to the frosh and leaving the varsity on its own.<br />\nWhile it is admirable for the frosh teams to have fan support, we don't think it should come at the expense of the<br />\nvarsity. Wouldn't it look nice if the 20,000 fans per game<br />\nthe Orioles average, suddenly made an excursion to San<br />\nAntonio to see the Missions play and left the Birds to play<br />\nto.an empty house. It has often been said that it is easy to<br />\nstick with a winner and this, it seems, was the reason for<br />\nearly desertion of the varsity stickmen. However, let it be<br />\nsaid that the frosh are not all-conquering either, having<br />\nbeen beaten in two scrimmaged with Maryland Lacrosse<br />\nClub, even though M.L.C. was without several of its stars<br />\non both occasions. Before anyone thinks this is a knock at<br />\nthe freshman lacrosse team, it should be said that we think<br />\nWilson Fewster has done a wonderful job with the frosh<br />\nand that several of the players will aid the varsity immeasurably in the future.<br />\nJAY JOTTINGS ... Hopkins track coach John Bridgers<br />\nhas proven himself quite a prognosticator. Before last week's<br />\nMason-Dixon track and field championships Bridgers said<br />\nthat the chief threats to meet records would be Dave Foltz<br />\nof Roanoke, Charley Nuttycombe of Randolph-Macon, Jim<br />\nFrazier of Hampden-Sydney, and Taylor Goode of Lynchburg. Meet results show that all four came through with<br />\nrecord-shattering performances, Foltz breaking two marks.<br />\n\u2022 .. George Breslau, Jay attackman, was called \"Indian\"<br />\nby his teammates earlier in the season but after he led the<br />\nsecond half charge against R.P.I. Breslau was dubbed \"Chief\"<br />\nby trainer Jimmy Benson.... In Saturday's fracas between<br />\nthe Jay frosh and the Navy Plebes the frosh managed to<br />\nget five men sent to the sidelines at the same time. However,<br />\nNavy could get only one goal while the skeleton crew was on<br />\nthe field. ...

The house system, whereby the dormitories are divided<br />\ninto separate entries was originally planned to promote<br />\na strong unity of subdivisions. However, in its present<br />\nstatus, the system encourages the isolation of cliques rather<br />\nthan the desired unity of medium sized groups.<br />\nBy themselves, none of these separations are final<br />\nenough to cause the sense of disunity to be present. The<br />\nisolation factor is this: although there are several points<br />\nat which the interest and activities of the residents of the<br />\ndormitory differ, there is no encouragement for a union of<br />\nthe various factors, nor is there any obvious advantage in<br />\nsuch a union. There is no common ground for an amalgamation.<br />\nThe dormitory resident needs to feel that he belongs<br />\nto more than his immediate circle of friends if the previously stated goal of the university is to be fulfilled. He<br />\nneeds a place, and above all, a reason to break his cliques.<br />\nAt the present time there is no situation or location conducive to informal discussions between non-acquainted dormitory residents. The provision of a room for such purposes<br />\nwould not be sufficient; indeed, there are ample facilities<br />\navailable at present.<br />\nPerhaps a suggestion could be taken from \"The University,\" which depicted a. member of the faculty mingling<br />\nwith dormitory student in what is loosely termed a bull<br />\nsession. If student-faculty discussions such as this actually<br />\ndid take place in the dormitories, a step would be taken in<br />\nthe provision of an opyortunity to discuss \"the themes<br />\nwhich are endless.\" An arrangement in the order of the<br />\n'Y' Coffee Hours in the dormitories might suffice for a<br />\nbeginning.<br />\nAnother serious oversight in planning a well-rounded<br />\ndormitory life is the lack of an effective social program.<br />\nThere is no provision for an informal mixing of the sees.<br />\nWith the exception of the few, and only partially effective,<br />\nmixers, all acquaintances are made off campus.

In ten games the champs<br />\nhave averaged 15.1 goals per game<br />\noffensively, while holding their op-<br /><br />\nponents to a mean of 4.6 goals.<br />\nThe Jays possess an 8.5 average<br />\noffensively and hold a 5 goal average defensively.<br />\nBoth teams have several reasons<br />\nfor wanting to capture a victory<br />\ntomorrow. Hopkins hopes to extend their winning streak to seven<br />\ngames; gain second place in the<br />\nfinal Cy Miller division and national rankings; end the long<br />\nTerp winning streak that was<br />\nstarted two years ago at the Jays'<br />\nexpense and win their first Homecoming since 1951.<br /><br />\nArlyn Marshall, Jay Co-captain, brings the ball upfield in an<br />\nintra-squad game as the Jays prepare for tomorrow's clash with<br />\nMaryland.

We have<br />\neverything to gain and little to<br />\nlose. We feel no pressure, but I<br />\nam sure that the boys would like<br />\nto finish the season with a flourish<br />\nby topping Maryland. The boys<br />\nwill have to give their top effort<br />\nto win this game, since they all<br />\nrealize the strength of this Maryland team.\"<br />\nLast year the Terps downed the<br />\nJays by a 11-5 count after being<br />\nheld to a 5-5 tie after three quarters.<br />\nJays Top Navy<br />\nRallying to score six times In<br />\nthe second half, the Hopkins lacrosse squad scored an 8-6 triumph over Navy at Annapolis before 3,000 fans last Saturday.<br />\nThis victory extended the Jay<br />\nwinning streak to six in a row, the<br />\nlongest Hopkins win skein since<br />\n1950, and gave the Jays their first<br />\nvictory over the Tars since 1951.<br />\nIt also marked the third consecutive week that the Jays have<br />\ncome from behind to capture a<br />\ntriumph.<br />\n(Continued on Pape 8)<br /><br />\nHoping to gain their first<br />\nHomecoming Day victory since<br />\n1951 and to end the current collegiate campaign on a successful<br />\nnote, the Blue Jay stickmen face<br />\nthe 1956 National Lacrosse Champions, Maryland, tomorrow at<br />\nHomewood Field at 2:30 p.m.<br />\nLast Saturday the Jays as.sured<br />\nthe Terps of their second straight<br />\ntitle by beating second, place Navy<br />\nby an 8-6 score at Annapolis.<br /><br />\nTerps Undefeated<br /><br />\nMaryland, on the other hand, has rolled over ten straight<br />\nopponents, compiling a total of 151 goals along the way, an<br />\naverage of fifteen per game. The Terp lineup is dotted with<br />\nAll-Americans and this group is led by Charlie Wicker who<br />\nhas run up the fantastic total of 20 goals and 43 assists<br />\nthis season. Jim Keating has added 24 goals to the Maryland cause.<br />\nHowever, it has been proven countless times that no<br />\nteam, not even the mighty Maryland, is invincible. The Terps<br />\ncan be beaten and Maryland has met no team this year more<br />\ncapable of doing it than Hopkins.<br />\nFrosh Vs. Varsity<br /><br />\nWhile we are on the subject of lacrosse we'd like to add<br />\na word about the freshman team. In the early part of the<br />\nseason, many Hopkins lacrosse fans were shifting their<br />\nallegiance to the frosh and leaving the varsity on its own.<br />\nWhile it is admirable for the frosh teams to have fan support, we don't think it should come at the expense of the<br />\nvarsity. Wouldn't it look nice if the 20,000 fans per game<br />\nthe Orioles average, suddenly made an excursion to San<br />\nAntonio to see the Missions play and left the Birds to play<br />\nto.an empty house. It has often been said that it is easy to<br />\nstick with a winner and this, it seems, was the reason for<br />\nearly desertion of the varsity stickmen. However, let it be<br />\nsaid that the frosh are not all-conquering either, having<br />\nbeen beaten in two scrimmaged with Maryland Lacrosse<br />\nClub, even though M.L.C. was without several of its stars<br />\non both occasions. Before anyone thinks this is a knock at<br />\nthe freshman lacrosse team, it should be said that we think<br />\nWilson Fewster has done a wonderful job with the frosh<br />\nand that several of the players will aid the varsity immeasurably in the future.<br />\nJAY JOTTINGS ... Hopkins track coach John Bridgers<br />\nhas proven himself quite a prognosticator. Before last week's<br />\nMason-Dixon track and field championships Bridgers said<br />\nthat the chief threats to meet records would be Dave Foltz<br />\nof Roanoke, Charley Nuttycombe of Randolph-Macon, Jim<br />\nFrazier of Hampden-Sydney, and Taylor Goode of Lynchburg. Meet results show that all four came through with<br />\nrecord-shattering performances, Foltz breaking two marks.<br />\n\u2022 .. George Breslau, Jay attackman, was called \"Indian\"<br />\nby his teammates earlier in the season but after he led the<br />\nsecond half charge against R.P.I. Breslau was dubbed \"Chief\"<br />\nby trainer Jimmy Benson.... In Saturday's fracas between<br />\nthe Jay frosh and the Navy Plebes the frosh managed to<br />\nget five men sent to the sidelines at the same time. However,<br />\nNavy could get only one goal while the skeleton crew was on<br />\nthe field. ...
