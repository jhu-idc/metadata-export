Usually I just<br />\ndismiss the letters with the<br />\nproper degree of student apathy,<br />\nbut recently I got a chance to<br />\nwatch these protectors of the<br />\ncommon good, in action. I<br />\nwould like to relate my story<br />\nnow, just in case any members<br />\nof the Hopkins community<br />\nwho may read this letter are<br />\nworried about their safety.<br />\nMy story begins on the<br />\nnight of Novermber 6, as I was<br />\nwalking from the Sigma Phi<br />\nEpsilon house to my apartment,<br />\na distance of about four blocks.<br />\n<br />\nAs I reached the art museum,<br />\nthree (count em) campus security cars with flashing lights<br />\nsped up Art Museum Drive and<br />\nscreeched to a stop right next to<br />\nme. Six security guards got out,<br />\nand one of them politely requested me to \"Freeze, now!\"<br />\nThe guard who wanted me to<br />\nfreeze, one officer Lerch, became the spokesman for the<br />\nboys from security, perhaps<br />\nbecause of his unique ability to<br />\ndeal in sentences. He asked me<br />\nfor identification. Since the<br />\nonly pieces of I.D. I was able to<br />\ngive him were such sketchy<br />\nreferences as a New York State<br />\ndrivers license, vehicle registration, Union Memorial I.D.,<br />\nvoter registration card, and my<br />\npersonalized checkbook, I was<br />\nobviously too dangerous a character to be allowed to walk the<br />\nstreets. They detained me for<br />\nabout. twenty minutes after<br />\nwhich good old officer Lerch<br />\ninformed me that I was a<br />\nSuspect in a sexual attack, and<br />\nthat he had been given my<br />\ndescription. When I asked him<br />\nwhat description, he replied,<br />\n\"white male, average height,<br />\nmedium weight.\" Wow, they<br />\nreally had me pegged. When I<br />\ntold the officer that description<br />\ncould apply to almost half the<br />\nHopkins community including<br />\nSteven Muller, he said, \"Who?\"<br />\nAnyway, the six security<br />\nguards stuck around brandishing<br />\ntheir night sticks, until the girl<br />\nfinally showed up and told them<br />\nI was not the attacker. I was<br />\nthen free to go, and as I left Mr.<br />\nLerch apologized to me. He said<br />\nthat he was sorry that I wasn't<br />\nthe attacker (because he would<br />\nhave liked to arrest me).<br />\nI realize that they were<br />\n\"only doing their job\" but let's<br />\nface ' it:<br />\nsomebody's been<br />\nwatching too many episodes of<br />\nDragnet.

Others were casualties of a period<br />\nof economic retrenchment\u2014it is a fact that three years<br />\nago, the university was in such fmancial trouble that a<br />\ncommittee of five faculty members was formed to find a<br />\nway of reducing the size of the Homewood faculty by<br />\n10 percent (the findings of this committee were never<br />\nimplemented, according to Dean of Homewood Faculties George Owen, but the gloomy climate here at that<br />\ntime surely caused some nervous junior faculty to leave).<br />\nBut it was also a fact that a number of popular,<br />\nor at the very least, controversial faculty members were<br />\ndenied either promotion or tenure outright.<br />\nEach of these tenure and promotion decisions<br />\nwas of course a separate case with its own set of considerations, but many were disputed at the time and are<br />\nstill questioned by remaining faculty and students. That<br />\nthe controversy has lingered on is not surprising. Among<br />\nthe faculty no longer here as a result of those decisions<br />\nare two women (one an outspoken feminist), a black,<br />\nand a Marxist, as well as several whose scholarship and<br />\nclassroom teaching had received a great deal of critical<br />\nacclaim.<br />\nPerhaps because the composition of the faculty<br />\nhas been changing dramatically during these years, the<br />\nUniversity's hiring choices and policies have also come in<br />\nfor more severe scrutiny and criticism. In this area, too,<br />\nthere is continuing controversy, for out of a faculty of<br />\nmore than 280, Hopkins has only 18 women and three<br />\nblack professors.<br />\nThe net effect of the University's hiring, promotion, and tenure record during the past three years is<br />\nthat a number of faculty have leveled the charge of<br />\ndiscrimination. Of course, the prevailing view among<br />\nfaculty members here, particularly among those in<br />\nfaculty government, is that the hiring, promotion, and<br />\ntenure decisions have been made fairly, on the basis of<br />\nscholarship.<br />\n\"At Hopkins, and at universities in general,<br />\nthere is an interest in making detached, scholarly judgements in hiring, promoting, and tenuring teachers,\" says<br />\nProf. Mack Walker, Chairman of the History Department, \"We're lucky, because we have a better chance to<br />\nlive with ourselves, the standards of veracity and honesty<br />\nare higher, as compared with a business corporation,for<br />\nexample. We can follow our high standards without fear<br />\nof the consequences, because we don't have to form<br />\nparties or butter up the boss. We're rarely put in the<br />\nposition of having to compromise.\"<br />\nOthers, however, feel that scholarship has not<br />\nbeen the decisive issue at all in these decisions, but only<br />\nan excuse and an untenable excuse at that.<br />\n\"There is a certain arbitrariness as to who is hired<br />\nand who gets tenure and promotion, and it translates<br />\ninto a &finite pattern,\" says Professor David Harvey,<br />\na tenured member of the Department of Environmental<br />\nEngineering. \"Women have a rough time, as well as the<br />\nminorities--blacks and Hispanics. And certainly anyone<br />\nwho is at all deviant politically--who rocks the boat or<br />\nwho has a slight whiff of leftism about him\u2014has a very<br />\nhard time getting through, whereas the straight, nice guy<br />\nwho publishes the right - kinds of papers will make it<br />\nmore easily. The result is an unhealthy homogeneity of<br />\nthe faculty, hurting the quality of the education offered<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nIs there discrimination at Hopkins? In this<br />\nreport, the News-Letter has attempted to answer that<br />\nquestion by reviewing past cases, speaking to deans,<br />\n<br />\nprofessors, ex-professors, students, and observers who<br />\nwere involved in the decisions, and presenting a's much<br />\nfactual information and as wide a variety of opinion as<br />\nwas available to us. The issue of discrimination is<br />\nconsidered both on the level of hiring, and of promotion<br />\nand tenure. In the end, while no simple answer to the<br />\nquestion emerges, several other important questions are<br />\nraised regarding the University's educational priorities,<br />\nthe mechanics of its hiring, promoting and tenuring<br />\nprocesses, the power structure of the faculty and administration, and the prevailing intellectual climate at Hopkins.<br />\nThe System<br />\nBefore exploring any of these questions, it is<br />\nhelpful to have some prior knowledge of how the system<br />\nworks; of the way in which power is distributed among<br />\nPresident, deans, faculty, and students, and of the<br />\nmechanical process of hiring and awarding tenure or<br />\npromotion here. There is no uniformity of these processes among colleges and universities, especially at<br />\nprivate institutions, and Hopkins' system is distinctive in<br />\na number of ways.<br />\nBy all accounts, the faculty here has a great<br />\ndegree of autonomy, particularly when functioning in<br />\ndepartmental units.<br />\n\"In a very real sense, this university is a collection of departmental units rather than a college,\" says<br />\nProfessor Jack Greene of the History Department.<br />\n\"Each department is essentially free to run itself as long<br />\nas it meets its teaching obligations. And each department has its own objectives and procedures, although<br />\nthey are often not formalized or written down.\"<br />\n\"The faculty regulates its own standards and<br />\nparticipates in the selection of its own members,\" says<br />\nProfessor Stanley Fish of the English Department. \"We<br />\nwould be very disturbed at interference from the administration or student body.\"<br />\n\"In other institutions you may see a great deal of<br />\nadministrative fiat, but we don't do that here because<br />\nadministrations change,\" says Sigmund Suskind, dean<br />\nof the School of Arts and Sciences. \"The departments<br />\nhave quite a bit to say in their own destiny, and the<br />\nfaculty has the nearest form of representative government to government by the people.\"<br />\nThe official forum of this \"government by the<br />\npeople\" is the Academic Council of the Homewood<br />\nFaculties. This body consists of twelve tenured professors, ten of whom have been nominated for five year<br />\nterms by a balloting of all professors, associate professors, and assistant professors on campus, and two of<br />\nwhom have been nominated to one year terms by the<br />\nother ten. (All nominations are subject to final approval<br />\nby University President Dr. Steven Muller.)<br />\nThe twelve faculty are the only voting members<br />\nof the council, except for President Muller, who can<br />\nexercise a power of veto. Also serving on the body in a<br />\nnon-voting capacity are the Deans of the Schools of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, and Engineering, the Dean of Homewood<br />\nFaculties, and the Provost and Vice-provost of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe council has the final say in matters of<br />\ntenure, promotion, and hiring. However,initial hiring is<br />\ndone by departments, and initial recommendations for<br />\npromotion come from tenured department members. If<br />\na recommendation is not given, the candidate cannot be<br />\nconsidered for promotion or tenure at Hopkins, and<br />\nthough appeal is possible and has occurred in rare<br />\ninstances, the general rule is that departmental decisions<br />\ngo unchallenged.<br />\n\"Because the system is so dependent upon<br />\ndepartmental autonomy, it's considered a real slap in the<br />\nface to challenge the decision of a department,\" says<br />\nProfessor Greene, himself a long-time member of the<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 9<br />\nAcademic Council until three years ago.<br />\nTenure at Hopkins is only granted at the level of<br />\nfull Professor, or with a very few exceptions at the<br />\n, Associate Professor level. In a tenure case, if the candidate receives his department's recommendation, he is<br />\nthen evaluated by an ad hoc committee of three faculty<br />\nmembers, equal or superior to him in rank, who are<br />\nappointed by either of the two deans. The committee,<br />\nwhich includes one member of the candidates's department, has the task of soliciting evaluations of the candidate from experts outside the university in his or her<br />\nfield. The committee then presents its findings to the<br />\ncouncil, and a final vote is taken.<br />\nAll proceedings of the ad hoc committee and the<br />\ncouncil are kept secret, both from the general faculty<br />\noutside the council and from the candidate himself. The<br />\nreasoning behind the secrecy is that it will ensure candid<br />\nevaluations on the part of field experts and colleagues of<br />\nthe candidate, and that it will protect the candidate<br />\nhimself in the event that a negative decision is reached.<br />\nThe pros and cons of this hiring, promoting, and<br />\ntenuring system will be debated (along with many other<br />\nquestions) in this article by a variety of faculty members, but it seems fair at this point to say that the system<br />\ndoes tend to reinforce whatever academic standards--and<br />\ntherefore status quos of ideology and diversity, if these<br />\nexist--that are currently the norm at Hopkins. Hopkins<br />\nis an exception among universities in that it only grants<br />\ntenure at the level of professor, and thus, in a system<br />\nwhich has been described above as both somewhat<br />\ninformal and highly confidential, one encounters primarily older faculty at the top of the power structure.<br />\nThese professors, many of whom served their own long<br />\nterms of apprenticeship before being admitted to the<br />\nranks of the permanent, make the decisions about who<br />\ntheir future colleagues will be.<br />\n\"My impression is that Hopkins operates like an<br />\nAfrican tribe in the sense that a lot of political events are<br />\ngoverned not so much by rules as by personal interaction, person to person contact, a network of influence,\" says Emily Ahern, a tenured professor in the<br />\nAnthropology Department. \"It's really a collection of<br />\nindividuals who have certain rights and duties and<br />\nobligations, and who also have vast areas of personal<br />\ndiscretion in how they choose to act on certain issues<br />\nand as departments. My impression is that the department that wants to influence the council must gain<br />\nsupport among the individual members of the council.<br />\nThere is nothing wrong with that, it just means you take<br />\nit as a given and operate accordingly.\"<br />\nHiring<br />\nSet in the context of such a system, the _charges<br />\nlevelled against the university may or may not take on<br />\nan added significance. First, let's consider the charge<br />\nthat the University discriminates against women and<br />\nminorities in its hiring choices and policies. It is an<br />\naccusation made, with varying degrees of severity, by<br />\nestablished faculty members, white males, and members<br />\nof the supposedly victimized interest rou s alike.<br />\n<br />\nDean Susskind. Dr. David Harvey<br />\n\"It's shameful that we don't have more women<br />\nand blacks on the faculty,\" says Professor Greene. \"I'm<br />\nnot accusing anyone of overt discrimination, but in my<br />\nsix years on the Academic Council, I saw a minimal<br />\nconcern with finding and attracting these people to<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nProfessor Ahern puts it more bluntly. \"I think<br />\nthat if hiring were done without discrimination at<br />\nHopkins, we'd have a lot more women in some of these<br />\ndepartments that we do now,\" she says.<br />\nUnfortunately, institutions comparable in size or<br />\nquality to Hopkins, such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton,<br />\nAmherst, and Swarthmore, will not release information<br />\nabout how many women and minority faculty members<br />\nthey have, so it is difficult to set this University in a<br />\nlarger context. However, some general statistics from<br />\nrecent National Research Council and National Center<br />\nfor Education Statistics studies show that Hopkins<br />\nis somewhat behind in its hiring of women and minoricont. on p. 10<br />\n<br />\n\fties (note: because virtually no statistics were available<br />\non Hispanic, Oriental, and Native American minorities in<br />\nthe teaching field, we are limited to discussing Black<br />\nAmericans in our consideration of minorities. No slight<br />\nagainst other groups is intended.).<br />\nWomen comprise roughly 20 percent of the<br />\nfaculty of the entire Johns Hopkins University, but only<br />\n6 percent of the Homewood faculty. All of those<br />\nwomen are in the School of Arts and Sciences; there are<br />\nno women on the faculty of the School of Engineering.<br />\nThis percentage is substantially less than the<br />\npercentage of women in the 1977-78 national employable labor force of Ph. D.'s, Doctoral Scientists, and<br />\nEngineers (the work force is defined as all post-doctorals<br />\nwith either full or part-time employment, as well as<br />\nthose who are seeking employment). In that year,<br />\nwomen totaled 21 percent of the labor force in the<br />\nHumanities, and 9 percent of the labor force in Engineering (it should be noted that less than 80 women<br />\nwere awarded engineering doctorates that year).<br />\nBlacks comprise only 1 percent of the Homewood faculty, and none are on the faculty of the School<br />\nof Engineering. The national statistics for blacks are less<br />\ncomplete than those for women, but they still offer<br />\nsome basis for comparison: in the 1978-79 academic<br />\nyear, blacks totaled 3.9 percent of all newPh.

D.<br />\npercentages,\" says Yvonne Theodore, the University's<br />\naffirmative action officer. \"Our appointments are more<br />\ndistinctly original and independent research . Their<br />\nindividual academic specialities and research interests fit<br />\nthe objective of the institution and of the individual<br />\ndepartments.\"<br />\nThe philosophy of Affirmative Action here, as<br />\nshaped by the administration and the Academic Council<br />\nand expressed by Ms. Theodore, is perhaps the best explanation of the composition of the Homewood faculty.<br />\nBefore considering that philosophy and its ramifications,<br />\nhowever, it is important to understand, insofar as it is<br />\npossible, what Affirmative Action is and the general way<br />\nin which it functions.<br />\nAffirmative Action is the legal mechanism,<br />\ncreated by a variety of Congressional Acts and Executive<br />\nOrders, which is supposed to ensure equal hiring opportunities for women, minorities, veterans, and handicapped persons. Essentially, it requires institutions<br />\n<br />\nHopkins.\" But secondly, and perhaps more important,<br />\nthe government apparently recognizes \"good-faith<br />\nefforts\" on the part of the University to accomplish its<br />\ngoals.<br />\n\"It's obvious to them we're giving it a hell of a<br />\ntry,\" Owen says.<br />\nIn other words, the government takes into<br />\naccount Hopkins' objectives and standards as a research<br />\ninstitution, and judges it on the basis of whether or not<br />\nefforts were made to publicize an offered position and<br />\nto delineate to all prospective applicants the necessary<br />\nqualifications.<br />\n\"We've encouraged the departments here to<br />\narticulate their research objectives, made them understand that they have to be active in their recruitment<br />\nefforts,\" Theodore says. \"The University has the right<br />\nto establish fair policies, but policy is not what is at issue<br />\nhere. It's how those policies are practiced, and I believe<br />\nthat the University's policy of excellence does not<br />\nnegate participation of women and minorities, but its<br />\npractices must validate the policy.\"<br />\nSome faculty and former faculty members take a<br />\nmore critical view of the University's hiring record than<br />\nthe government, and fault the philosophy of Affirmative<br />\nAction here on several grounds. First of all, there is the<br />\ncharge that Hopkins is simply too elitist in the enforcement of its standards.<br />\n<br />\nFaculty or Fiction?<br />\nThere are a variety of defenses for Hopkins' poor which receive government grants and contracts to<br />\nstatistical showing.

And now HEW has relaxed it efforts, in part<br />\nbecause it met with so much resistance from the tenure<br />\nsystem.\"<br />\nDonna Harraway, an Assistant Professor in the<br />\nHistory of Science Department at Hopkins Until she was<br />\ndenied promotion last year, takes the charge even<br />\nfurther, arguing that Affirmative Action has backfired<br />\nagainst women and minorities.<br />\n\"I think it (A.A.) has been used against women<br />\nand minorities both,\" she says. \"It's set up so that it<br />\ngenerates an enormous amount of paperwork, false<br />\nadvertising for jobs that don't really exist, and resentment that it turned against the victim. The very people<br />\nwho have been excluded become even more excluded<br />\nand are blamed again for their own exclusion.\"<br />\nHarraway, who is now a tenured Associate<br />\nProfessor at the University of California at Santa Cruz,<br />\nargues that the threat of suspended funding for universities who do not meet Affirmative Action standards is<br />\nempty, \"because it's all or nothing - either you cut off<br />\nall federal funds, or you do nothing. And so nothing is<br />\ndone. It's utterly toothless.\"<br />\nTheodore counters that government sanctions are<br />\nboth potent and enforced.<br />\n\"Too few people realize that it's not true that<br />\nthe institution as a whole must falter before sanctions<br />\nare imposed,\" she says. \"If one department warrants<br />\nsanctions, the whole school, the entire University is<br />\nsanctioned. Every federal dollar can be withdrawn. It is<br />\na fact - there are several pending cases where that threat<br />\nhas been real and there is a strong possibility of that<br />\nhappening now - at the University of North Carolina,<br />\nand Berkeley, to name a few.\"<br />\nFinally, there are those who simply reject the<br />\n<br />\n\fUniversity's claim that there are not sufficient numbers<br />\nof qualified women and minority applicants for positions here. They regard the numbers of women and<br />\nminorities on the faculty as proof that the University is<br />\nsimply not looking hard enough.<br />\n\"It's true that the size of Hopkins makes it<br />\ndifficult to make dramatic adjustments, but there hasn't<br />\nbeen any concerted effort in this direction,\" says Professor Franklin Knight, Professor of Cuban and Latin<br />\nAmerican social and economic history, and one of two<br />\ntenured blacks at Hopkins. \"[refuse tobelieve there are not<br />\nenough qualified women and minority applicants.

It's group that's bound to be inimical<br />\nto minority interests.\"<br />\nMs. Theodore has a more philosophical response<br />\nto this line of criticism. \"It's virtually impossible to<br />\nimplement a program that is going to be acceptable to<br />\nthe employer, the government, and the women and<br />\nminorities,\" she says.\"When looked at from all perspectives, the progress is going to be unsatisfactory.\"<br />\nThus far, it seems that the customers most<br />\nsatisfied with Affirmative Action here are the employer<br />\nand the government.<br />\nIt is difficult to think of a position in any other<br />\nfield which is analogous to that of the tenured professor.<br />\nEven presidents of major (corporations, making annual<br />\nseven digit salaries, can be swept out of their jobs with<br />\nthe changing fortunes of the times, while less glorified<br />\nemployees in most professions live with a certain daily<br />\nreality: they could be fired.<br />\nThe tenured professor, except under the most<br />\nrare and extreme circumstances, does not have to worry<br />\nabout this problem.

And they argue that the opinions of students,<br />\nanother group of citizens at Hopkins, are also without<br />\nconsequence in these decisions.<br />\nFurther, they charge that other considerations,<br />\noutside but distinctly related to academics, are also<br />\nworking against many candidates. Being female, a<br />\nmember of a minority, or politically active or controversial were factors mentioned by Dr. Harvey as being<br />\nimportant in tenure and promotion denials.<br />\nFinally, they say that \"collegiality\", a feeling<br />\nthat seems to be a cross between academic and personal<br />\nharmony (or lack thereof), plays entirely too large a role<br />\nin promotion and tenure decisions.<br />\nWe will discuss the alleged autocracy and secrecy<br />\nof the faculty, government, and then try to assess these<br />\nother charges by discussing them in the context of five<br />\ncases from the past three years in which candidates were<br />\ndenied tenure or promotion. First, a brief introduction<br />\nto these five former Hopkins faculty is in order<br />\nAlicia Borinsky - Dr. Borinsky along with her<br />\nwas denied tenure last<br />\nhusband, Jeffrey Willman<br />\nyear after each had reached the rank of Associate<br />\nProfessor in the Romance Languages Department.<br />\nBorinsky, who was born in South America and studied<br />\nunder Borges as a child, taught Modern Spanish-American literature and criticism. Both her area of specialization and her own ideas were considered avant-garde by<br />\nmembers of her department. She had published a<br />\nmonograph, and a number of articles at the time of her<br />\nrejection, most of which were in Spanish. Her denial<br />\nwas quite controversial. Students resigned from the<br />\nprogram in response to the decision. Dr. Borinsky now<br />\nteaches at Boston University.<br />\nDonna Haraway - Dr. Haraway was an Assistant<br />\nProfessor in the History of Science Department until she<br />\nwas denied promotion last year. Her case is particularly<br />\nsurprising, in that she was denied after receiving a<br />\nunanimous recommendation from her department.<br />\nHaraway's research concerns itself with the interaction<br />\nbetween the biological sciences, such as neural physiology, and the social sciences such as anthropology. Her<br />\nacademic work was intimately related to her outspoken<br />\nfeminist views: \"I've been trying to understand animal<br />\nsocieties, on a theoretical level, in terms of certain forms<br />\nof political domination.\" She had published a book and<br />\nseveral articles. She led a feminist organization on<br />\ncampus while she was at Hopkins. She is now a tenured<br />\nAssociate Professor at U.C. Santa Cruz.<br />\n<br />\nRay Kea - Dr. Kea, a black who had taught in<br />\nEurope and Africa, was denied promotion after serving<br />\nfor seven years as an Assistant Professor in the History<br />\nDepartment. He taught African history, and at the time<br />\nof his rejection was completing a history of Africa (later<br />\npublished) based in large part upon indigenous materials,<br />\nsuch as old slave trading records, rather than upon<br />\ntraditional Western views of the continent. Kea now<br />\nteaches at Carleton College in Minnesota.<br />\nRichard Pfeffer - Dr. Pfeffer, a Marxist political<br />\nscientist, was denied tenure two years ago in what was<br />\nprobably the most controversial of any of the denial<br />\ncases. Pfeffer had concentrated primarily on Chinese<br />\nMarxism while he was at Hopkins, but had begun to<br />\nstudy American capitalism betore his denial. His book<br />\nWorking for Capitalism deals with this topic. It documents his seven month experience as a factory worker,<br />\nand contains an analysis of six other well-known books<br />\non labor and capitalism.<br />\nPfeffer was a political activist who publically<br />\ncriticized the University on a number of occasions. Over<br />\n1,500 students voted in a referendum in support of his<br />\nrequest for an appeal of his case, and two deans threatened to resign if the appeal was not granted. The<br />\ncouncil granted the appeal, but later denied Pfeffer<br />\ntenure.<br />\nPfeffer, who had earned a law degree before<br />\ncoming to Hopkins, is now working for Legal Aid<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\nSamuel Weber - Dr. Weber was an Associate<br />\nProfessor in the Humanities Denartment until he was<br />\ndenied tenure last, year. His work here was crossdisciplinary, dealing with a relationship between psychoanalysis and literature. It also questioned certain basic<br />\nnotions, such as traditional definitions of text, and<br />\ntraditional division of subject matter into disciplines.<br />\nWeber was co-founder and co-editor of Glyph, an<br />\ninternational humanities journal originally published by<br />\nthe Hopkins Press. Nearly all of the staff of Glyph,<br />\nwhich included Alicia Borinsky, Jeffrey Mehlman,and a<br />\nnumber of other junior faculty in the languages and<br />\nhumanities, are no longer at Hopkins. Weber himself is<br />\ncurrently teaching at the University of Minnesota,<br />\nalthough he may return to Hopkins in the next' three<br />\nyears.<br />\nHaving met the subjects, let us consider on the<br />\nbasis of their cases the charges leveled against the system.<br />\nThe secrecy of the tenure process, as it prevents<br />\none from finding out a great deal else about tenure at<br />\nHopkins seems the logical place to begin.<br />\nFrom the day the candidate applies, he is supposed to know nothing about who is on the ad hoc<br />\n.committee soliciting evaluations about him or about<br />\nwhat those evaluations say. If he is rejected, he is never<br />\ngiven an official, detailed analysis of why. His only<br />\ninput into the whole process is that he is allowed to<br />\nsubmit a list of names (of people whom he wishes to<br />\nhave solicited for evaluations of his work), which will<br />\ncomprise half of the final list. All information is kept<br />\nsecret form the rest of the Hopkins community as well.<br />\nOnly the department chairman, ad hoc committee, and<br />\nmembers of the Academic Council know the particulars<br />\nof a case.<br />\nThere are two justifications given for this secrecy. First it ensures candid evaluations from colleagues who don't have to worry about the candidate<br />\nknowing their opinions.<br />\n\"Faculty at different universities trade around on<br />\nwriting about each other all the time,\" says Professor<br />\nJack Greene, an advocate of confidentiality despite his<br />\nother criticisms of the processes here. \"I'm writing an<br />\nevaluation of a case coming up at another univeristy<br />\nright now. If I know he'll see it, I won't be able to write<br />\nas open and candid a letter, and I think that few people<br />\nwould be strong enough to do so.\"<br />\nThe other justification is that secrecy protects a<br />\nrejected candidate.<br />\n\"The problem is the negative opinions in denials,\" Professor Walker says. \"If we have to air them<br />\npublicly, it can be very damaging to the candidate's<br />\nchances elsewhere.\"<br />\nThe first justification, that confidentiality<br />\nensures a candid evaluation by colleagues, obviously<br />\nholds true for many professors. They simply feel that<br />\nthey would be unable to write candidly if they knew the<br />\ncandidate was going to see their evaluation.<br />\nThere also professors who, if they do not favor<br />\npublic access to letters, see a pragmatic value in writing<br />\nwith equal candor whether their evaluation is to be<br />\nconfidential or not.<br />\n\"I tend to write things I can sustain, because I<br />\nassume that there is no such thing as a secret letter,\"<br />\nsays Professor Franklin Knight of the History Department. \"I won't say anything I'm unwilling to defend,<br />\nbecause the potential for litigation is great, and people<br />\ncan get hold of anything these days via the Freedom of<br />\nInformation Act.\"<br />\nYet, rejected candidatet are outraged by this<br />\n<br />\nrationale, especially as most other professions do not<br />\naccord references such protection.<br />\n\"Anybody writing a letter that is going to affect<br />\nthe course of a person's career damn well ought to be<br />\nprepared to defend it,\" says Sam Weber.<br />\nThe second justification, that secrecy -protects<br />\nthe reputation of the rejected candidate, is challenged by<br />\nno one more vigorously than by the rejected candidates<br />\nthemselves.<br />\n\"I was confronted with the reality of unemployment, I think I could have at least been confronted<br />\nwith the reasons why,\" says Ray Kea. \"The reasons<br />\nneedn't be made public, but they could at least have told<br />\nme. I suppose that would be asking too much, since it is<br />\none's life.\"<br />\nIn general, there is a sense of frustration among<br />\nproud, intellectually dedicated people at not being able<br />\nto at least know why they are being rejected.<br />\n\"I'm not about to sit here and say that there are<br />\nno grounds for criticism of my work,\" Donna Haraway<br />\nsays. \"But one doesn't have access to the process, to the<br />\nreasons for decision, which I resent most strongly. I<br />\nhave a lot of questions, and no way of knowing the<br />\nanswers to them.\"<br />\nThose in faculty government feel that such<br />\nquestions are unnecessary. They believe they use<br />\nsecrecy judiciously, and that it is a safe tool in academic<br />\nhands.<br />\n\"Universities have their own constitutionality,<br />\nand they needn't adhere to other forms.\" says History<br />\nDepartment Chairman Mack Walker. \"These decisions<br />\nare made by honest people, not by political pushovers.\"<br />\nAnd Romance Languages Department Chairman<br />\nPaul Olson adds,\"I won't deny that secrecy can be used<br />\nfor improper purposes, but I don't think that happens<br />\nhere, because faculty are the ultimate authority.\"<br />\nHowever, their critics feel that secrecy at the<br />\nvery least is a possible point of departure for abuses in<br />\nother areas.<br />\n\"Secrecy raises serious questions about the<br />\nestablishment of democratic controls,\" says Sam Weber.<br />\n\"A small group has access to all the facts, and those who<br />\nare non-tenured and object have no way to verify<br />\nanything. It's a very fundamental issue, since it intervenes at the point you would try to find out about<br />\nanything else.\"<br />\nAt this point, the reader who is skeptical of these<br />\nimplications of skullduggery may ask,\"What else is there<br />\nto find out? What evidence is there to indicate that<br />\nanything at all questionable has happened?\"<br />\nThe answers are that most people are not sure<br />\nwhat there is to find out, and that there is little factual<br />\nevidence of questionable happenings. In gathering<br />\ninformation for this article, we were given a great many<br />\nsubjective descriptions of the kind of power play tactics<br />\nthe system here is open to. The tactics described were<br />\nallegedly used in a variety of situations, and for a variety<br />\nof different reasons, and they offer an interesting<br />\nglimpse at the way the power structure at Hopkins may<br />\nreally work. We stress here again that we cannot verify<br />\nthese allegations; further, that many of the people<br />\nmaking the allegations qualify them with the statement<br />\nthat the system at Hopkins is no worse, and in some<br />\ncases actually better, than systems at other institutions,<br />\nand that the system in general is as good a system as<br />\nthey can envision. Nevertheless, they make the following<br />\nallegations:<br />\n-That personal whim and politics, whatever the<br />\nmotivation, is a built-in condition of the system: This is<br />\nstated by tenured faculty here, as well as by the system's<br />\ncasualties.<br />\n\"To get tenure here, it's important not to offend<br />\npowerful departmental types, especially the chairman.\"<br />\nsays Professor David Harvey. \"The decisions are often<br />\ndictated by power plays within the departments. Times<br />\nare tighter, and people are protecting their empires here.<br />\nIf they expand them, it will be at somebody else's<br />\nexpense.\"<br />\nEduardo Saccone, a tenured professor in the<br />\nRomance Languages, concurs. \"It's a serious question<br />\nwhether or not a department can function with people<br />\nwho are unable to get along,\" he says. \"The element has<br />\nits weight in decisions. It's an unjust element perhaps,<br />\nbut it probably can't be avoided. And it's a terrible<br />\nthing, but the people who are more powerful may get<br />\ntheir way.\"<br />\nMarc Blum, a Baltimore attorney who has<br />\nworked on a number of tenure cases (some in connection with Hopkins) corroborates these comments with a<br />\nmore detailed analysis.<br />\n\"In all of these situations, there is always going<br />\nto be a chairman or a 'star' in the department whom<br />\neveryone knows it really the arbiter in the decision,\" he<br />\nsays. \"If you are less than truly excellent, and you<br />\ndisplease or irritate that star-- if you criticize a lesser,<br />\na professor who is in the department to support the star,<br />\nor if you simply don't get along and are not good<br />\nenough that people are willing to put up with what they<br />\npersonally don't like about you\u2014that star is going to get<br />\n<br />\n\fNOVEMBER 14, 1980/ PAGE 12<br />\nscont.from p. 11<br />\nyou at tenure time.<br />\nBlum describes academia as a profession which is<br />\ndeceptive and hard to classify in terms of its tolerance of<br />\n\"idyncratic behavior\" on the part ofits employees. In business,<br />\nfor example,you can<br />\nbe judged on the bottom line of the<br />\nnet amount you contributed to the company's profits,<br />\nand it it was enough, people will put up with you. But<br />\nacademia has no bottom line, and you are rated on other<br />\npeople's subjective judgements. Everything you do is<br />\nimportant, from the kinds of articles you publish to the<br />\nway you handle yourself at the lunch-table at the<br />\nHopkins Club.\"<br />\nThose who were denied tenure and promotion<br />\nhere testify to these descriptions in the way they speak<br />\nof their own experiences.<br />\nRay Kea says, \"When I was at Hopkins, I was<br />\nunder the mistaken belief that you did what you were<br />\npaid to do. But I was naive. It turned out that all the<br />\nMachaivellian behind-the-scenes activity was just as<br />\nimportant.\"<br />\nThe general response by those who hold power<br />\nto these allegations is best expressed by Professor Paul<br />\nOlson, Borinsky's chairman in the Romance Languages<br />\nDepartment.<br />\n\"Considerations of personality, or of anything<br />\nother than scholarship, are unimportant,\" he says. \"The<br />\nbottom line in these decisions is the evaluation of the<br />\ncandidate by outside opinions. Mere gossip has no place<br />\nin the serious business of decision making.\"<br />\nIn other words,as it is at the hiring level, scholarship is cited by the university as the most important<br />\ncriteria in promotion and tenure decisions. It is necessary, then, to consider what the university's definition of<br />\nscholarship is, for critics charge that scholarship is<br />\ndefined so narrowly here as to exclude many valid but<br />\nnon-traditional view points and methodologies.<br />\nScholarship, in a general sense, is a teacher's<br />\nindependent work in his field: his research, books,and<br />\npublications in academic journals, his original contributions to the field. Those in the decision-making roles<br />\nhere make no bones about the fact that this institution<br />\nputs a very high premium on research, as opposed to<br />\nteaching.<br />\n\"I would have to say that if someone is an<br />\nunquestionably superb research scholar and only a<br />\nmoderately successful teacher, that person would have<br />\nan excellent chance of getting promotion or tenure,\"<br />\nsays university President Dr. Steven Muller. \"On the<br />\nother hand, if someone is a brilliantly successful teacher,<br />\nbut only moderately successful on the research side, that<br />\nperson would find much greater difficulty in being<br />\nappointed.\"<br />\nThe prevailing view, however, is that great<br />\nscholarship ensures great teaching by means of the<br />\n\"trickle-down\" effect.<br />\n\"The primary jewel in this university's crown is<br />\nits faculty, one that is actively writing, publishing, and<br />\ngoing to conferences,\" says Stanley Fish, a tenured<br />\nprofessor in the English Department. \"This automatically means, to a certain degree, an exciting classroom<br />\natmosphere.\"<br />\nCritics, speaking from their own experience,<br />\ntranslate this to mean that teaching is given virtually no<br />\nweight at all. if teaching matters at all, how could it<br />\nnot have pushed me over the top,\" Richard Pfeffer asks<br />\nbitterly. The overwhelming student turnout at the<br />\nreferendum on his behalf indicated the undergraduate's<br />\nopinion of his teaching, as did a 1975 school-wide<br />\nStudent Council survey on student opinion of teachers.<br />\nThe survey (conducted by the 1975 Student Council)<br />\nawarded Pfeffer scores of 3.8 and 3.6, the highest score<br />\never, according to the report,and credited him as having<br />\n\"the respect of every undergraduate who has ever taken<br />\na course with him.\"<br />\nThe same survey awarded History Professor, Ray<br />\nKea a score of 3.4,described him as \"well-liked and well<br />\nrespected by undergraduates\u2014 and credited him with<br />\nhandling \"a huge teaching load.\" In fact, the report<br />\naccused the History Department of \"...offering one<br />\ncourse per semester per appointment.\" and of succeeding in this practice by means of the \"amazing teaching<br />\nload (assumed) by the associate and especially the<br />\nassistant professors. who must take up all the slack<br />\nfor those professors who are not teaching.\"<br />\nClearly. teaching is not being given even the<br />\nminimal priority officially accorded it. Alicia Borinsky,<br />\ntoo, was highly regarded by her students, so much so<br />\nthat five graduate students who had been working<br />\nclosely with her resigned from the Hopkins languages<br />\nMaster program in protest of her tenure denial. Donna<br />\nHaraway evaluated as an excellent teacher in a survey<br />\nlast year. Of our five former faculty members whom we<br />\nhave been discussing in this article, only Samuel Weber<br />\nwas not especially known for his classroom performance<br />\nbut he was specifically known for his work on improving<br />\nthe undergraduate curriculum offerings.<br />\nImplicit in this failure to recognize teaching is a<br />\nfailure to recognize student voice in evaluating teachers.<br />\n<br />\nSome members of faculty government, such Professor<br />\nWalker and Dean Susskind, say that student opinion is<br />\nnoted,d if not by any official means, and taken into<br />\nOthers, however, state quite frankly that<br />\nstudents at Hopkins have almost no say in what will be<br />\nfacing them in the classroom.<br />\n\"At some universities, there is student participation on tenure committees, but I would be categorically<br />\nagainst that here in any way shape or form,\" say Professor Fish. \"I can understand why students would want<br />\nthat kind of participation, but it's perfectly mysterious<br />\nto me why the faculty would want to give it to them.<br />\nI'm not saying that students aren't the best judges for<br />\nthemselves, but they are another political class whose<br />\ninterests don't always dovetail with ours. It's just not in<br />\na faculty member's interest to give up to students the<br />\nprocedure by which he is selected, promoted, and<br />\ntenured. I've known faculty who would give it up, but<br />\nhappily not here.\"<br />\nWeber himself makes no accusations against the<br />\nuniversity, beyond his criticism of the secrecy of the<br />\nprocess. He concedes that he has heard rumors concerning people's motives for seeking his rejection, but says<br />\nhe is not in a position to comment on them because he<br />\ndoesn't know the facts. However, he offers some<br />\nconjectures about what aspects of his work might have<br />\ngotten him in trouble. He mentions Glyph the internation journal he co-founded and co-editied\u2014and interesting comment, in that the publication seems to be the<br />\nideal achievement that a junior faculty member could<br />\nproduce to strengthen his or her case at research-oriented, publishing-conscious Hopkins.<br />\n\"Although each person's case was different, I<br />\ndon't think its an accident that none of the original<br />\npeople from Glyph are still at Hopkins:' he says. \"I<br />\ndon't mean to suggest a diabolical plan, but it does<br />\nreflect the atmosphere. We were not a dogmatic group,<br />\nbut we did take a sufficiently identifiable position, and<br />\nany time you take an identifiable position on theoretical<br />\nissues, it's going to win you friends and enemies.\"<br />\nWeber himself says that his own ideas question<br />\nthe traditional definition of literature, in a way which<br />\ncould effect the traditional structuring of academic<br />\ndisciplines and departments. \"I suppose that might have<br />\nthreatened some people,\" he says. But he adds that<br />\nneither his ideas nor those of anyone on the staff of<br />\nGlyph were \"controversial beyond sonic basic controversies in the Humanities.\"<br />\nWeber is especially critical of the circumstances<br />\nwhich caused the departures or rejections of most of the<br />\nstaff of Glyph, who included Alicia Borinsky, her<br />\nhusband Jeffrey Mehlman, Rodolphe Gasche and Louis<br />\nMann of the Romance Languages Department, and<br />\nHenry Sussman and Carol Jacobs (husband and wife)of<br />\nthe Humanities Center.<br />\n\"All of these people were more or less forced to<br />\ngo, which was unjust in terms of their academic and<br />\nintellectual credentials,\" he says. \"They were all good<br />\nenough to merit tenure. Their presence was a valuable<br />\nasset to Hopkins, and their departure was unfortunate.\"<br />\nNo one the News-Letter has spoken to has<br />\noffered a clear criticism of Weber's scholarship which<br />\nmight have been the basis for his tenure denial. Dean<br />\nSusskind offers a general rationale which seems to be the<br />\nmost plausible that is applicable to the Weber case,<br />\nthough the Dean was not refering to Weber at the time.<br />\n\"A candidate can be doing interesting work in<br />\nX,Y, and Z, but the work may have no relation to his<br />\nsupposed area of concentration,\" the dean says. \"We<br />\ncan't promote him on the basis of work that isn't in his<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nAlicia Borinsky is much more vehement in her<br />\ncondemnation of the university's handling of her case.<br />\nShe charges, first of all, that there were prejudices<br />\nagainst her area of study\u2014 modern Latin American<br />\nliterature.<br />\n\"People regarded it as peripheral, less important,\" she says. \"They've relegated it in that department<br />\nto a position where it will never be taught by anyone but<br />\na junior faculty member.\"<br />\nBorinsky argues that one important reason that<br />\nthe quality of her work was not recognized is that no<br />\none else in the department,other than the chairman, was<br />\nproficient in reading Spanish.<br />\n\"I don't know if my work would be considered<br />\ncontroversial or not,\" she says. \"But I don't think that's<br />\nthe issue. I don't think anyone in that department ever<br />\ngot to the point of reading any of my work.\"<br />\nHowever, Professor Paul Olson, Borinsky's<br />\nChairman in the Department of Romance Languages,<br />\ncounters that the candidate's work was read and understood.<br />\n\"Her field was in avant-garde literature, using<br />\ncritical language in a critical mode, but it was not such<br />\ntechnical language that only a specialist could understand it,\" he says.<br />\nOlson adds that one factor working against<br />\nBorinsky was her compartively small record of publication.<br />\n<br />\n\"It would be inappropriate to say that Dr.<br />\nBorinsky did not have sufficient competencher field to<br />\nmerit a position in the profession,\" he says. \"It simply<br />\nwasn't sufficient, in our opinion, to merit a position<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nBorinsky's case, in particular, stunned a number<br />\nof professor's at Hopkins who were familiar with and<br />\nthought highly of her work.<br />\n\"I wrote to the Academic Council independently<br />\non her behalf, because I felt she was not given due<br />\nprocess,\" says Professor Franklin Knight. \"It was<br />\ninconceivable to me that someone of that stature would<br />\nbe denied tenure. I was appalled that they thought her<br />\nnot sufficiently qualified to be a Hopkins scholar.\"<br />\nAnd Professor John Barth of the Writing Seminars Department comments, \"I was very sorry to see<br />\nBorinsky go; she presided over the boom at Hopkins in<br />\ncontemporary Latin-American fiction, perhaps the most<br />\ninteresting phenomenon in the second half of this<br />\ncentury.\"<br />\nThe cases of Borinsky and Weyer do not demonstrate anything<br />\nthe extremely high and<br />\nsomewhat changeable<br />\nmoreh<br />\ntstaan dard of scholarship the<br />\nBut Borinsky<br />\nuniversity enforces.<br />\nsets her own case in the context of the general upheaval<br />\nin the Romance languages and Humanities Departments and argues that her own case was part of a general pattern.<br />\n\"The staff of Glyph was forced out as a result of<br />\nthe incapacity of certain senior professors to co-exist<br />\nwith young,actively publishing junior faculty,\" she says.<br />\n\"And in the case of the Romance Languages Department, the chairman there (Professor Olson) presided<br />\nover the departure of a great many people-- Professor<br />\nRivers, Mann, Paris, Gashe, myself, and my husband-whether some of us were fired, or left because of the<br />\natmosphere. So it was not just a case of a nice community getting rid of two trouble-makers-- myself and<br />\nmy husband\u2014 but a case of a community systematically<br />\ngetting rid of a great deal of people. From any professional standpoint,that's a failed chairmanship.\"<br />\nOlson rejects these charges, saying that each<br />\nfaculty member left for an entirely different reason than<br />\nthe other, some, like Louis Mann, entirely of their own<br />\naccord and against the wishes of the department.<br />\n\"It may seem like an alibi, to say that we've had<br />\none form of bad luck after another,\" he says,\"and when<br />\nyou've. had that kind of luck, people begin to suspect<br />\nyou deserve it\u2014 but its true we've simply had bad luck.<br />\nWe're optimistic about rebuilding now.\"<br />\nOf all the teachers who left the Romance Languages Department, the News-Letter was able to reach<br />\nonly one, Professor Rivers, now chairman of the Languages Department at the State University of New York<br />\nat Stonybrook. Rivers confirmed<br />\nthat<br />\nhe<br />\nhad left \"for personal reasons\", but added that *his<br />\ndeparture, and that of others', was a resonse to an<br />\natmosphere created by \"vindictive attempts to get rid of<br />\ndissident elements.\"<br />\nOther candidates who were denied tenure or<br />\npromotion feel that their political activism both outside<br />\nand inside Hopkins \u2014 their emphasis on a practical<br />\napplication of their own teachings -- was the cause of<br />\ntheir rejection.<br />\n\"I think that one of the things that links some of<br />\nus who have been eliminated from Hopkins is our refusal<br />\nto separate the dimensions of theory and practise in our<br />\nwork,\" says Donna Haraway. \"I think that my work<br />\nought to be fundamentally accoutable to the women's<br />\nmovement, but that's going to create a lot of contradictions in everyday work within the university. I was<br />\nexplicitly identified as a feminist on the campus, the<br />\nsame way that Ric (Pfeffer) was identified as a Marxist.<br />\nAnd you look at your life in a professional institution,<br />\nand you say, 'this professional institution is in many<br />\nways corrupt, and serve power interests which dominate me and others. And at the same time, your work is<br />\ndirected as a critique against domination. When you<br />\nturn that into the content of your work,the university is<br />\ngoing to see that as going too far.\"<br />\nOnce again, the university's response is that any<br />\nviewpoint or methodology of scholarship is acceptable<br />\nprovided it meets the university's standeards of excellence.<br />\n\"I'm certainly not uncomfortable knowing that<br />\nsomebody on the faculty is a Marxist, any more than I<br />\nam uncomfortabl e knowing that somebody is a monetarist, or a monarchist, for all I care,\" says President<br />\nMuller, \"but I feel that those are not criteria with which<br />\nyou make your judgements.

It is a competent production, its<br />\nstrengths balanced by its weaknesses.<br />\nOne of the shortcomings of the<br />\nply which is difficult to overcome is the<br />\nplay itself. The story seems to be merely<br />\na rehash of Who's Afraid of Virginia<br />\nWoolfl2 cast with slightly different characters but centering on the same situation:<br />\nstrife between family members, friends,<br />\nand marriage partners, and the problem<br />\nof where to draw the line. Sure, there are<br />\nsome interesting elements not present in<br />\nVirginia Woolf--the omnipresent liquor<br />\ncabinet which is the dominant prop; the<br />\nscenaril of the old couple, Harry and<br />\nEdna, who drop by one evening because<br />\nof some mysterious, unexplained fear,<br />\n<br />\nand then lock themselves in one of the<br />\nbedrooms and refuse to come out--but a<br />\nfew interesting ideas doth not a good play<br />\nmake, and Albee wrote pretty much the<br />\nsame play before. Self-plagarism is an<br />\nunpardonable sin of writing, especially<br />\nwhen the clone (A Delicate Balance) fails<br />\nto equal or surpass the original (Who's<br />\nAfraid of Virginia Woolf?). In addition,<br />\nAlbee unashamedly violates Chekov's rule<br />\nof writing, \"If there is a gun on the<br />\nmantlepiece in the first act, be sure that it<br />\nhas been fired by the end of the second.\"<br />\nTobias, one of the main characters, muses<br />\nabout shooting the entire family in their<br />\nsleep, and in another scene Julia his<br />\ndaughter, threatens Harry and Edna with<br />\na Luger. Nothing is really ever done with<br />\na gun, though, so it becomes an unnecessary red herring. Another loose end is<br />\nthe constant mention of Tobias and<br />\nAgnes' dead son, which does nothing to<br />\nfurther the plot or characterizations<br />\nsignificantly and is therefore superfluous.<br />\nDespite these drastic fubars, though, the<br />\nplay' is 'better-than-adequate drama, so it<br />\n<br />\nby Charles Dikkenss (\"two k's; the<br />\nwell-known Dutch author\") and Ethel the<br />\nAardvark Goes Quantity-Surveying. It is<br />\nbits like this one that have been the main<br />\njustification for Python's cult status, and<br />\nthat put the rest of Monty Python's<br />\nContractual Obligation Album to shame<br />\n<br />\nWoody Allen<br />\nSide Effects, Woody Allen's third<br />\nvolume of prose pieces, is a wildly uneven<br />\ncollection: funny, often hilarious in<br />\nspots, but ultimately unsatisfying. While<br />\nmatured admirably in<br />\nhas<br />\nAllen<br />\nrecent years as a filmmaker, his<br />\nstagnated;<br />\nfiction seems to have<br />\nanyone familiar with \"Annie Hall\" or<br />\n\"Manhattan\" knows how incisive his film<br />\ncomedy has become, but most of the<br />\nstories that comprise Side Effects still<br />\nrely heavily on the same tired jokes about<br />\nsex, death, and philosophy that can be<br />\nfound in only slightly different form in<br />\nAllen's nightclub routines, his early films,<br />\nor the books Getting Even and Without<br />\nFeathers.<br />\nNot that sex, death, and philosophy aren't funny. On the contrary,<br />\nAllen is one of few writers whose material<br />\nhas that rare quality of making the reader<br />\nlaught out loud. \"Needleman was not<br />\nan easily understood man,\" he writes in<br />\n\"Remembering Needleman.\" \"His reticence was mistaken for coldness, but he<br />\nwas capable of great compassion, and<br />\nafter witnessing a particularly horrible<br />\nmine disaster once, he could not finish a<br />\nsecond helping of waffles.\" In \"The UFO<br />\nMenace,\" he relates the story of Sir<br />\nChester Ramsbottom who, while driving,<br />\nclaimed to have seen \"a cigar-shaped<br />\nobject\" tracking his car. \"Upon investigation, experts determined that the<br />\n'cigar-shaped object' Was Sir Chester's<br />\nnose. Naturally, all his evasive actions<br />\ncould not lose it, since it was attached to<br />\nhis face.\"<br />\nOther bright spots in Side Effects<br />\nare \"My Apology,\" a parody of the<br />\nimprisonment and subsequent execution<br />\nof Socrates; \"The Kugelmass Episode,\"<br />\nthe story of a humanities professor<br />\nwho hires a magician to propel him<br />\nbackward in time so that he can have an<br />\naffair with Madam Bovary ;\"A Giant Step<br />\nfor Mankind,\" a speculative account of<br />\nthe scientific research leading up to the<br />\n<br />\ndiscovery of the Heimlich hug; and \"The<br />\nQuery,\" a one-act play concerning<br />\n.Abraham Lincoln's dubious response to<br />\nthe question: \"How long should a man's<br />\nlegs be?\"<br />\nThere are two pieces in which<br />\nAllen attempts greater cohesion through<br />\ncloser adherence to standard short-story<br />\nformulae. One,\"Retribution,\" deals with<br />\nthe dilemma faced by a man who falls in<br />\nlove with his girlfriend's mother. \"The<br />\nShallowest Man,\" probably the book's<br />\nmost effective selection, is the tale of<br />\nLenny Mendel, a man forced by obligation and peer pressure..to visit a remote<br />\nacquaintance, Iskowitz, who is dying of<br />\ncancer. At the hospital, he develops a<br />\ncrush on Iskowitz's nurse, and from then<br />\non visits every day, feigning sympathy for<br />\nIskowitz only to gain the nurse's good<br />\nfavor. Months later, unaware of Mendel's<br />\nulterior motives, Iskowitz dies a grateful<br />\nman, and Mendel starts dating the nurse.<br />\nBut these two stories are the only<br />\nparallels Side Effects offers us to Allen's<br />\ngrowth as a director and screenwriter.<br />\nFor the most part, these pieces (written<br />\nbetween 1975 and 1980 and published<br />\nprimarily in The New Yorker, The New<br />\nRepublic, and The Kenyon Review) are<br />\nonly shadows of Allen's genius. This fact,<br />\nconsidered together with the book's<br />\nlength (150 pages) and the throw-away or<br />\nfiller quality of some of the stories,<br />\ncontributes to an overall feeling of<br />\ndisappointment with the book as a whole,<br />\nespecially for the person who has parted<br />\nwith nine dollars to read it.<br />\nIf you appreciate Woody Allen<br />\n(and you have the nine dollars), there is<br />\nmuch to recommend Side.Effects. It<br />\ncontains enough one-liners and anecdotes<br />\nto make you the life of your next pseudointellectual bull session; however, you<br />\nmay find yourself searching in vain for<br />\nanything more.<br />\n<br />\n1/\\IR Si<br />\nstill retains some entertainment value.<br />\nThe quality of the acting differs<br />\nfrom character to character and scene to<br />\nscene. The two primary characters,<br />\nTobias (Robert Walsh) and Agnes (Ruth<br />\nWalsh) seem very wooden and lifeless at<br />\nthe beginning of the play (Yes, I realize<br />\nthat the theme of the play is the emptiness of bourgeois life, but that is no<br />\nexcuse for bland, stiff acting). The first<br />\nscenes are droll to the point of near<br />\ncatatonia, and it is difficult to discern<br />\nwhether the dialogue is wistful or sarcastic. The Walshes performances steadily<br />\nincrease in quality as the \u2022play progresses,<br />\nalmost as if acting in.this production were<br />\nanalogous to trying on a glove. Ruth<br />\nWalsh fills out her rolo well, hut her<br />\n<br />\nhusband Robert's basso rotunda voice<br />\nand stentorian inflections are more<br />\napropos to a banking commercial than to<br />\nAlbee. After reading the play and comparing it to his interpretation of the<br />\ncharacter, it does not appear that Walsh<br />\nsatisfied Albee's intentions for the<br />\ncharacter, a man of more depth than<br />\nWalsh portrays him 'as having. Admittedly, the Walshes are not Tracey and<br />\nHepburn, but their acting is still good,<br />\nalbeit slightly off the mark, and the<br />\nblame for the problems probably falls<br />\nupon the director rn<br />\nthan the actors.<br />\nThe other characters Care much better.<br />\nHarry and Edna (Milton Freedman and<br />\nMary Stewart) are pen,<br />\n:ctly cast. Freed,()<br />\n<br />\n\fcont.from. p. 12<br />\nWithin the liberal framework the only thing they can<br />\nlegitimately say about work that violates their ideology<br />\nis that it is bad scholarsbip.

Is someone going to move up<br />\nthe heirarchy who says witchdoctory is quackery?\"<br />\nPfeffer points to what he sees as the limited<br />\nrange of viewpoints currently offered by the Hopkins<br />\ntenured political science department as a manifestation<br />\nof the university's ideological framework.<br />\n\"They cover politics in this country with studies<br />\nof the courts, the Congress, the political parties, the<br />\nbureaucracy, and the Presidency,\" he says. \"It's very<br />\ntraditional, although, that's not necessarily bad. But<br />\nthere's no sense that maybe we shouldn't study politics<br />\nby using catagories that simply reflect the institutions<br />\nexactly as they are handed to us-- for example they have<br />\nno one teaching the politics of work. If you want to<br />\nunderstand the political life of a country, you need to<br />\nunderstand the day to day life of its people. Daily life is<br />\na struggle for most people in America, and the University doesn't teach about that.\"<br />\nWhereas \"poor scholarship\" is a shaky rationale<br />\nin the rejection of Donna Haraway\u2014a unanimous<br />\nrecommendation from her department speaks loudly\u2014 it<br />\nis at least more of an open possibility in Pfeffer's case.<br />\nAt the time of his denial, Pfeffer had published one<br />\nbook,Working For Capitalism. A fascinating account of<br />\nhis seven month experience operating a trash forklift in a<br />\nBaltimore factory, the book is nevertheless predominantly \"unacademic\" in its approach (save for a final<br />\ndiscussion of literature on working.) Pfeffer theorizes<br />\nextemporaneously throughout the book based on<br />\njournal entry accounts of his daily experiences in the<br />\nfactory. There are no footnotes, no appeal to the traditional academic authority. The book received strong<br />\npraise from NoamChomsky, the noted scholar, and from<br />\nMaryland congressman Parren Mitchell, but it was also<br />\npanned by a number of field experts.<br />\nThus Pfeffer's scholarship was open to question,<br />\nat least according tizi traditional standards. But it is also<br />\ntrue that his politics, particularly as manifested on<br />\ncampus, antagonized the university on a number of<br />\noccasions.<br />\nDuring the Vietnam War, he led a student strike<br />\nagainst on-campus recruiting for the military. He was<br />\ninvestigated, and later cleared, by the deans at that time<br />\nfor inciting violence. In February of 1975, he led a<br />\nvocal protest against the university's decision to award<br />\nan honorary degree to the sister of the Shah of Iran. In<br />\nthe spring of 1978, he also delivered a graduation<br />\naddress, which was carried in the Sun, in which he<br />\nattacked capitalism, and stated that a university which<br />\ncould grant a degree to the Shah's sister was not an<br />\ninstitution which could dedicate itself to a search for<br />\n<br />\ntruth.<br />\nThere is no way of verifying the extent to which<br />\nPfeffer's and Haraway's activism played a role in their<br />\nrespective denials. A source who was close to the Pfeffer<br />\ndecision at the time it was made asserts that \"the council's decision was grossly unfair\", and that the council<br />\n\"had worked itself into a position where it could not<br />\npossibly have approved him,\" but again, this is only<br />\nhearsay. But it would seem that the ideological challenges that the two teachers directed at the university<br />\nwould place them beyond its range of acceptability,<br />\nespecially if the following characterization by Professor<br />\nFish of universities in general is at all accurate:<br />\n\"Universities are by nature very conservative<br />\nplaces,\" says Fish, who describes himself as a political<br />\nconservative. \"I taught at Berkeley in the years when it<br />\nwas thought of as the center of all revolutionary movements in American education, and I can tell you that<br />\nBerkeley was very conservative in its faulty makeup, in<br />\nits course offerings and general standards. People's Park<br />\nand the Free Speech movement haven't changed it a bit.<br />\nIn general, American education is more likely to absorb<br />\nand co-opt challenges than it is to be shaken by them.\"<br />\nwork concerned itself with the point of view of the<br />\nblack African, and Donna Haraway, whose work concerned itself with won.en.<br />\n\"Racism varies at institutions around the country, but it takes a particularly strong and subtle form at<br />\nHopkins,\" he says. \"I went to too many faculty cocktail<br />\nparties, where one says \"I teach at Hopkins\" and sees<br />\nthe disbelief on their faces. I think what most typifies<br />\nthe mentality there is a comment somebody made ot me<br />\nwhen he heard I was going out to Minnesota to teach.<br />\nHe asked me, 'how can you teach African history out<br />\nthere if there are no blacks;\"<br />\nPrefacing her statement by reiterating that she<br />\nhas only hearsay to go on, Donna Haraway says of her<br />\nown case, \"I think that the Academic Council acted out<br />\nof believing that feminist work is by definition peripheral, that any time they see a list of publications that don't<br />\nemphasize what they already consider central, it is by<br />\ndefinition peripheral.\"<br />\nBeing a dissident element, or considered one, is<br />\nwhat these candidates see as an important cause of their<br />\nfailure to get tenure or promotion. But there are those<br />\nwho feel that they were considered a peripheral element,<br />\nthat the unimportance of their work in the eyes of their<br />\ncolleagues was the obstacle they could not overcome.<br />\nThese rejected cnadidates consider this view of their<br />\nwork as a form of chauvinism: Ray Kea, a black whose<br />\nHaraway expresses that sam apprehension of<br />\nother former faculty members who were working<br />\nin unconventional areas, that no one ever took the<br />\ntrouble to read and understand her work.<br />\n\"I found them systematically ignorant of what a<br />\nfeminist point of view in scholarship might be,and why<br />\nthey might be required to inform themselves about it.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 1<br />\nBut one of the ways that marginality is enforced is that<br />\nyou are the one who is always required to explain why<br />\nyour point of view ought to be considered by the<br />\ndominant. It's culpable ignorance of their part. They<br />\nthink they are exercising political domination.\"<br />\nIt is important to note here that neither Professor Knight, one of two blacks now in the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, nor two women faculty members,feel<br />\nthat racism or sexism occurs at Hopkins.<br />\n\"I don't go around wondering if I'm treated like<br />\nan equal here,\" Knightsays, \"The reaction to you here is<br />\nbased on whether or not you're gregarious and self-confident, an active member of the intellectual community<br />\nBut perhaps, as the numbers of women and<br />\n\u2022<br />\nblacks at Hopkins tend to affirm, Donna Haraway's<br />\ncomment is apt: \"If you're a woman (or black) you<br />\nhave to be at least one and a half times as good as the<br />\ncompetition.\"<br />\nWe have come, at long last, to the end of our list<br />\nof alleged abuses of the hiring, promotion, and tenure<br />\nprocess. We have seen that the existing faculty government exercises a considerable degree of power,a power<br />\nthat is made stronger by the tool of secrecy.<br />\nWe have attempted to explore charges that this<br />\ncombination of power and secrecy has resulted in a<br />\nnarrow definition of scholarship, the most important<br />\ncriteria for evaluating promotion and tenure cndidates.<br />\nWe have tried to assess: the purported imbalance<br />\nbetween teaching and research as educational priorities<br />\nat Hopkins, and the related imbalance between faculty<br />\nand student voice in ordering these priorities; the claims<br />\nthat certain academic and political viewpoints pose a<br />\nthreat to a subconscious ideological framework of the<br />\nfaculty, and are therefore excluded; and the charge that<br />\nother academic viewpoints, which proceed directly from<br />\nthe race or gender of the scholar, are considered peripheral and unimportant by the University, and are also<br />\nexcluded.<br />\nIn the end, after all our questioning, and all our<br />\nattempts to determine from various viewpoints, what the<br />\nkey to the system is, we have settled on a simple factor<br />\nnot yet discussed. It is a force in<br />\ndecision-making<br />\nwhich may be every bit as stealthy and unjust as some of<br />\nthose alleged above. This force is the desire for what<br />\nsome people have referred to as \"collegiality\"-- the<br />\ndesire of those in power to choose someone they can<br />\nfeel comfortable with, to be their colleague for the<br />\nsubsequent twenty or thirty years. It is the fear, characterized earlier by Professor Saccone,that a department<br />\ncannot function where members don't get along'. It is a<br />\nfactor which, once recognized, renders a little less<br />\nplausible theories of vast conspiracies and plots. Instead,<br />\nit accents the possibilities for unpredictable, capricious,<br />\nand even paradoxical decisions because,as attorney Marc<br />\nBlum said earlier, the bottom line is subjective judgement.<br />\n<br />\n13S0 Celebrity Concert<br />\n<br />\nSilkyStrings Marred By Ugly Organ<br />\nBY JEFFREY K. MEYER<br />\nWednesday night, the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony Orchestra presented the third<br />\nin its series of Midweek \"Celebrity\"<br />\nconcerts under the direction of its musical director, Sergiu Comissiona. The<br />\nopening work in this all-French concert<br />\nwas Maurice Ravel's Rapsodie Espagnole.<br />\nDivided into four short yet continuous<br />\nmovements, the Rapsodie can be a<br />\ndazzling orchestral showpiece. Maestro<br />\nComissiona's slow tempi heightened the<br />\nmysterious qualities of the opening<br />\nmovement, Prelude a la nuit, a stunning<br />\norchestral tone painting in the Impressionist style. However, these same slow<br />\ntempi disrupted the flow of the work and<br />\n,,nade it seem more disjointed than it<br />\nreally is. Comissiona was not helped by<br />\nthe sometimes ragged playing of the<br />\nviolins nor the muted sound of the<br />\nbrass.<br />\nMusical matters improved with<br />\nthe appearance of the featured soloist,<br />\nYo-Yo Ma,for a performance of the Cello<br />\nConcerto of Edouard Lab. Mr. Ma<br />\npossesses an extremely warm and vibrant<br />\nsound which was demonstrated to good<br />\neffect. The work itself is another story.<br />\nWritten in 1876 and possessing neither<br />\nthe exoticism of Massenet nor the wit of<br />\nSaint-Saens, it displays the worst French<br />\nConservatoire style. The Orchestra did its<br />\nbest and there was a good rapport be-1<br />\n<br />\ntween them and Ma. Following a short<br />\nspeech of appreciation to Joseph and<br />\nRebecca Meyerhoff for their endowment<br />\nof the Principal Cellist's Chair, Ma returned to play one of the Boccherini cello<br />\nduets with Mihaly Virizaly, the BSO's<br />\nprincipal cellist.<br />\nThe Orchestra's program concluded with the Symphony No. 3 in C<br />\nMinor, the \"Organ\" Symphony, of<br />\nCamille Saint-Saens. Dedicated to the<br />\n<br />\nSergiu Comissiona conducts BSO<br />\n<br />\nmemory of Franz Liszt and written on<br />\na commission from the London Philharmonic, it is Saint-Saens' most ambitious<br />\norchestral work, combining a large<br />\norchestra with piano and organ to splendid effect. Although it is divided into<br />\ntwo parts, the- symphony still retains the<br />\ntraditional four-movement form, with the<br />\norgan entering in the second and fourth<br />\nmovements. The first two movements<br />\nwere magnificent, with the BSO strings<br />\nplaying with a silkiness previously unheard this season. The strings were also<br />\nat their best for the last two movements,<br />\nbut the brass, as in ,the Ravel, was<br />\nstrangely muted.<br />\nThe instrument that prevented the<br />\nperformance from being a total success<br />\nwas the organ. Since the Lyric Theatre<br />\ndoes not have a house organ\u2014nor will the<br />\nnew Symphony Hall, for that matter\u2014<br />\nthe Symphony borrowed an Allen Digital<br />\nOrgan from the manufacturer for this<br />\nseries of performances. It was loud!

Although Peale has used all forms<br />\nof mass media to promote<br />\nreligious growth, he claimed he<br />\nhas never solicited funds nor<br />\ngotten involved in politics.

He<br />\npredicted that Reagan will surround himself with a cabinet of<br />\nadvisors who are well known and<br />\nwho have shown the ability<br />\nto handle real world situations.<br />\nScali criticized President<br />\nCarter for reluctance to choose a<br />\ncabinet that was assertive in<br />\ndisagreeing with him. According<br />\nto Scali, Carter's greatest failure<br />\nwas his inability to \"communicate in a memorable way to the<br />\nAmerican people.\" Scali maintained that Carter lacks the<br />\neloquence and style that is<br />\nnecessary for a president to<br />\ncommunicate a sense of power<br />\nand decisiveness to the populace.<br />\nScali added that Carter \"embalms his speeches\" and often<br />\nshowed \"a dangerously careless<br />\nmisuse of words\" during his<br />\nadministration. Scali described<br /><br />\nReagan as a more effective<br />\nspeaker who may be able to<br />\ninspire the public.<br />\nAlthough Scali did not<br />\ndiscuss the \"International Crisis\"<br />\nin depth, during the question<br />\nand answer session that followed<br />\nhis lecture he addressed the<br />\nquestion of whether the United<br />\nStates should attempt to maintain or achieve the role as the<br />\nultimate world power. \"The<br />\nUnited States has the rightful<br />\nrole to be the number one power<br />\nin the world,\" Scali said, \"because if we (the United States)<br />\ndo not accept the position there<br />\nwill be no one else to fill it.\"<br />\nScali added that the American<br />\npublic will \"not be content to be<br />\nnumber two.\"<br />\nScali conceded that \"all<br />\npolicies have risks\" but maincont. on p. 6<br /><br />\nHopkins'Fundraiser<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nand more enjoyable.<br />\nFor anyone wishing to become a professional fundraiser,<br />\nHaley recommends an educational background in business,<br />\nspecializing in the financial and<br />\ntax aspects, with liberal doses of<br />\nwriting and communications.<br />\nHaley's own background was in<br />\nsales and marketing, and he<br />\ncomes to Hopkins by way of<br />\nCornell, where he spent eleven<br />\nyears, and Clarkson College,<br />\nwhere he worked for four and a<br /><br />\nhalf.

Usually I just<br />\ndismiss the letters with the<br />\nproper degree of student apathy,<br />\nbut recently I got a chance to<br />\nwatch these protectors of the<br />\ncommon good, in action. I<br />\nwould like to relate my story<br />\nnow, just in case any members<br />\nof the Hopkins community<br />\nwho may read this letter are<br />\nworried about their safety.<br />\nMy story begins on the<br />\nnight of Novermber 6, as I was<br />\nwalking from the Sigma Phi<br />\nEpsilon house to my apartment,<br />\na distance of about four blocks.<br /><br />\nAs I reached the art museum,<br />\nthree (count em) campus security cars with flashing lights<br />\nsped up Art Museum Drive and<br />\nscreeched to a stop right next to<br />\nme. Six security guards got out,<br />\nand one of them politely requested me to \"Freeze, now!\"<br />\nThe guard who wanted me to<br />\nfreeze, one officer Lerch, became the spokesman for the<br />\nboys from security, perhaps<br />\nbecause of his unique ability to<br />\ndeal in sentences. He asked me<br />\nfor identification. Since the<br />\nonly pieces of I.D. I was able to<br />\ngive him were such sketchy<br />\nreferences as a New York State<br />\ndrivers license, vehicle registration, Union Memorial I.D.,<br />\nvoter registration card, and my<br />\npersonalized checkbook, I was<br />\nobviously too dangerous a character to be allowed to walk the<br />\nstreets. They detained me for<br />\nabout. twenty minutes after<br />\nwhich good old officer Lerch<br />\ninformed me that I was a<br />\nSuspect in a sexual attack, and<br />\nthat he had been given my<br />\ndescription. When I asked him<br />\nwhat description, he replied,<br />\n\"white male, average height,<br />\nmedium weight.\" Wow, they<br />\nreally had me pegged.

Not only<br />\ndid you disgrace a fine man<br />\n(whether you agree with him or<br />\nnot), but you managed to<br />\ndefame the office of the Presidency.<br />\nObviously in writing your<br />\neditorial, you ignored one major<br />\nthing, the people'F views. Must<br />\nwe remind you that President<br />\nReagan received 51% of the<br />\npopular vote (8,302,906 more<br />\nvotes than Carter received).

In your editorial you listed among others<br />\nBirch Bayb. To set the record<br />\nstraight, Dan Quayles (Bayh's<br />\nopponent) rejected out of state<br />\nmoney and repudiated the Moral<br />\nMajority. You also failed to<br />\ntake into account that those<br />\nSenators who were defeated<br />\nwere ou,t of touch with the<br />\nviews of their constituents.<br />\nChurch's view on the Panama<br />\nCanal, and McGovern's view on<br />\ngovernment spending are just<br />\nexamples of Senators voting the<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nReaders On Peale, Boze,Red Cross<br />\ncont.from p. 4<br />\nopposite way their constituents<br />\nwant.

Do they think I enjoy<br />\nsitting through those meetings?<br />\nThat I get some masochistic<br />\npleasure out of their arguments?<br />\nAnd whatever happened to the<br />\nage-old tradition of buttering-up<br />\njournalists for good press?

Our motto was taken<br />\nfrom the Gospel of John,<br />\nChapter 8, in which Jesus says,<br />\n\"If you live according to my<br />\nteaching, you are truly my<br />\ndisciples; then you will know the<br />\ntruth, and The truth will set you<br />\nfree.\"<br />\nDr. Peale described as scientists, men and women who seek<br />\nAs stated,<br />\nafter the truth.<br />\nthis implies the existence of<br />\nuniversal truths.

We do not<br />\nbelieve this to be true and this is<br />\nnot what Scripture has to say.<br />\nScripture says God is absolute<br />\nand we will all stand before him<br />\none day. Dr. Peale described<br />\nJesus Christ as \"the greatest<br />\nscientist of all time.\" He uses<br />\nthis title because Christ has<br />\nrevealed to us something we, in<br />\nour limited capacity, could never<br />\ndiscover on our own: God's love<br />\nfor us and His plan for our<br />\nsalvation.

Others were casualties of a period<br />\nof economic retrenchment\u2014it is a fact that three years<br />\nago, the university was in such fmancial trouble that a<br />\ncommittee of five faculty members was formed to find a<br />\nway of reducing the size of the Homewood faculty by<br />\n10 percent (the findings of this committee were never<br />\nimplemented, according to Dean of Homewood Faculties George Owen, but the gloomy climate here at that<br />\ntime surely caused some nervous junior faculty to leave).<br />\nBut it was also a fact that a number of popular,<br />\nor at the very least, controversial faculty members were<br />\ndenied either promotion or tenure outright.<br />\nEach of these tenure and promotion decisions<br />\nwas of course a separate case with its own set of considerations, but many were disputed at the time and are<br />\nstill questioned by remaining faculty and students. That<br />\nthe controversy has lingered on is not surprising. Among<br />\nthe faculty no longer here as a result of those decisions<br />\nare two women (one an outspoken feminist), a black,<br />\nand a Marxist, as well as several whose scholarship and<br />\nclassroom teaching had received a great deal of critical<br />\nacclaim.<br />\nPerhaps because the composition of the faculty<br />\nhas been changing dramatically during these years, the<br />\nUniversity's hiring choices and policies have also come in<br />\nfor more severe scrutiny and criticism. In this area, too,<br />\nthere is continuing controversy, for out of a faculty of<br />\nmore than 280, Hopkins has only 18 women and three<br />\nblack professors.<br />\nThe net effect of the University's hiring, promotion, and tenure record during the past three years is<br />\nthat a number of faculty have leveled the charge of<br />\ndiscrimination. Of course, the prevailing view among<br />\nfaculty members here, particularly among those in<br />\nfaculty government, is that the hiring, promotion, and<br />\ntenure decisions have been made fairly, on the basis of<br />\nscholarship.<br />\n\"At Hopkins, and at universities in general,<br />\nthere is an interest in making detached, scholarly judgements in hiring, promoting, and tenuring teachers,\" says<br />\nProf. Mack Walker, Chairman of the History Department, \"We're lucky, because we have a better chance to<br />\nlive with ourselves, the standards of veracity and honesty<br />\nare higher, as compared with a business corporation,for<br />\nexample. We can follow our high standards without fear<br />\nof the consequences, because we don't have to form<br />\nparties or butter up the boss. We're rarely put in the<br />\nposition of having to compromise.\"<br />\nOthers, however, feel that scholarship has not<br />\nbeen the decisive issue at all in these decisions, but only<br />\nan excuse and an untenable excuse at that.<br />\n\"There is a certain arbitrariness as to who is hired<br />\nand who gets tenure and promotion, and it translates<br />\ninto a &amp;finite pattern,\" says Professor David Harvey,<br />\na tenured member of the Department of Environmental<br />\nEngineering. \"Women have a rough time, as well as the<br />\nminorities--blacks and Hispanics. And certainly anyone<br />\nwho is at all deviant politically--who rocks the boat or<br />\nwho has a slight whiff of leftism about him\u2014has a very<br />\nhard time getting through, whereas the straight, nice guy<br />\nwho publishes the right - kinds of papers will make it<br />\nmore easily. The result is an unhealthy homogeneity of<br />\nthe faculty, hurting the quality of the education offered<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nIs there discrimination at Hopkins? In this<br />\nreport, the News-Letter has attempted to answer that<br />\nquestion by reviewing past cases, speaking to deans,<br /><br />\nprofessors, ex-professors, students, and observers who<br />\nwere involved in the decisions, and presenting a's much<br />\nfactual information and as wide a variety of opinion as<br />\nwas available to us. The issue of discrimination is<br />\nconsidered both on the level of hiring, and of promotion<br />\nand tenure. In the end, while no simple answer to the<br />\nquestion emerges, several other important questions are<br />\nraised regarding the University's educational priorities,<br />\nthe mechanics of its hiring, promoting and tenuring<br />\nprocesses, the power structure of the faculty and administration, and the prevailing intellectual climate at Hopkins.<br />\nThe System<br />\nBefore exploring any of these questions, it is<br />\nhelpful to have some prior knowledge of how the system<br />\nworks; of the way in which power is distributed among<br />\nPresident, deans, faculty, and students, and of the<br />\nmechanical process of hiring and awarding tenure or<br />\npromotion here. There is no uniformity of these processes among colleges and universities, especially at<br />\nprivate institutions, and Hopkins' system is distinctive in<br />\na number of ways.<br />\nBy all accounts, the faculty here has a great<br />\ndegree of autonomy, particularly when functioning in<br />\ndepartmental units.<br />\n\"In a very real sense, this university is a collection of departmental units rather than a college,\" says<br />\nProfessor Jack Greene of the History Department.<br />\n\"Each department is essentially free to run itself as long<br />\nas it meets its teaching obligations. And each department has its own objectives and procedures, although<br />\nthey are often not formalized or written down.\"<br />\n\"The faculty regulates its own standards and<br />\nparticipates in the selection of its own members,\" says<br />\nProfessor Stanley Fish of the English Department. \"We<br />\nwould be very disturbed at interference from the administration or student body.\"<br />\n\"In other institutions you may see a great deal of<br />\nadministrative fiat, but we don't do that here because<br />\nadministrations change,\" says Sigmund Suskind, dean<br />\nof the School of Arts and Sciences. \"The departments<br />\nhave quite a bit to say in their own destiny, and the<br />\nfaculty has the nearest form of representative government to government by the people.\"<br />\nThe official forum of this \"government by the<br />\npeople\" is the Academic Council of the Homewood<br />\nFaculties. This body consists of twelve tenured professors, ten of whom have been nominated for five year<br />\nterms by a balloting of all professors, associate professors, and assistant professors on campus, and two of<br />\nwhom have been nominated to one year terms by the<br />\nother ten. (All nominations are subject to final approval<br />\nby University President Dr. Steven Muller.)<br />\nThe twelve faculty are the only voting members<br />\nof the council, except for President Muller, who can<br />\nexercise a power of veto. Also serving on the body in a<br />\nnon-voting capacity are the Deans of the Schools of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, and Engineering, the Dean of Homewood<br />\nFaculties, and the Provost and Vice-provost of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe council has the final say in matters of<br />\ntenure, promotion, and hiring. However,initial hiring is<br />\ndone by departments, and initial recommendations for<br />\npromotion come from tenured department members. If<br />\na recommendation is not given, the candidate cannot be<br />\nconsidered for promotion or tenure at Hopkins, and<br />\nthough appeal is possible and has occurred in rare<br />\ninstances, the general rule is that departmental decisions<br />\ngo unchallenged.<br />\n\"Because the system is so dependent upon<br />\ndepartmental autonomy, it's considered a real slap in the<br />\nface to challenge the decision of a department,\" says<br />\nProfessor Greene, himself a long-time member of the<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 9<br />\nAcademic Council until three years ago.<br />\nTenure at Hopkins is only granted at the level of<br />\nfull Professor, or with a very few exceptions at the<br />\n, Associate Professor level. In a tenure case, if the candidate receives his department's recommendation, he is<br />\nthen evaluated by an ad hoc committee of three faculty<br />\nmembers, equal or superior to him in rank, who are<br />\nappointed by either of the two deans. The committee,<br />\nwhich includes one member of the candidates's department, has the task of soliciting evaluations of the candidate from experts outside the university in his or her<br />\nfield. The committee then presents its findings to the<br />\ncouncil, and a final vote is taken.<br />\nAll proceedings of the ad hoc committee and the<br />\ncouncil are kept secret, both from the general faculty<br />\noutside the council and from the candidate himself. The<br />\nreasoning behind the secrecy is that it will ensure candid<br />\nevaluations on the part of field experts and colleagues of<br />\nthe candidate, and that it will protect the candidate<br />\nhimself in the event that a negative decision is reached.<br />\nThe pros and cons of this hiring, promoting, and<br />\ntenuring system will be debated (along with many other<br />\nquestions) in this article by a variety of faculty members, but it seems fair at this point to say that the system<br />\ndoes tend to reinforce whatever academic standards--and<br />\ntherefore status quos of ideology and diversity, if these<br />\nexist--that are currently the norm at Hopkins. Hopkins<br />\nis an exception among universities in that it only grants<br />\ntenure at the level of professor, and thus, in a system<br />\nwhich has been described above as both somewhat<br />\ninformal and highly confidential, one encounters primarily older faculty at the top of the power structure.<br />\nThese professors, many of whom served their own long<br />\nterms of apprenticeship before being admitted to the<br />\nranks of the permanent, make the decisions about who<br />\ntheir future colleagues will be.<br />\n\"My impression is that Hopkins operates like an<br />\nAfrican tribe in the sense that a lot of political events are<br />\ngoverned not so much by rules as by personal interaction, person to person contact, a network of influence,\" says Emily Ahern, a tenured professor in the<br />\nAnthropology Department. \"It's really a collection of<br />\nindividuals who have certain rights and duties and<br />\nobligations, and who also have vast areas of personal<br />\ndiscretion in how they choose to act on certain issues<br />\nand as departments. My impression is that the department that wants to influence the council must gain<br />\nsupport among the individual members of the council.<br />\nThere is nothing wrong with that, it just means you take<br />\nit as a given and operate accordingly.\"<br />\nHiring<br />\nSet in the context of such a system, the _charges<br />\nlevelled against the university may or may not take on<br />\nan added significance. First, let's consider the charge<br />\nthat the University discriminates against women and<br />\nminorities in its hiring choices and policies. It is an<br />\naccusation made, with varying degrees of severity, by<br />\nestablished faculty members, white males, and members<br />\nof the supposedly victimized interest rou s alike.<br /><br />\nDean Susskind. Dr. David Harvey<br />\n\"It's shameful that we don't have more women<br />\nand blacks on the faculty,\" says Professor Greene. \"I'm<br />\nnot accusing anyone of overt discrimination, but in my<br />\nsix years on the Academic Council, I saw a minimal<br />\nconcern with finding and attracting these people to<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nProfessor Ahern puts it more bluntly. \"I think<br />\nthat if hiring were done without discrimination at<br />\nHopkins, we'd have a lot more women in some of these<br />\ndepartments that we do now,\" she says.<br />\nUnfortunately, institutions comparable in size or<br />\nquality to Hopkins, such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton,<br />\nAmherst, and Swarthmore, will not release information<br />\nabout how many women and minority faculty members<br />\nthey have, so it is difficult to set this University in a<br />\nlarger context. However, some general statistics from<br />\nrecent National Research Council and National Center<br />\nfor Education Statistics studies show that Hopkins<br />\nis somewhat behind in its hiring of women and minoricont. on p. 10<br /><br />\nties (note: because virtually no statistics were available<br />\non Hispanic, Oriental, and Native American minorities in<br />\nthe teaching field, we are limited to discussing Black<br />\nAmericans in our consideration of minorities. No slight<br />\nagainst other groups is intended.).<br />\nWomen comprise roughly 20 percent of the<br />\nfaculty of the entire Johns Hopkins University, but only<br />\n6 percent of the Homewood faculty. All of those<br />\nwomen are in the School of Arts and Sciences; there are<br />\nno women on the faculty of the School of Engineering.<br />\nThis percentage is substantially less than the<br />\npercentage of women in the 1977-78 national employable labor force of Ph. D.'s, Doctoral Scientists, and<br />\nEngineers (the work force is defined as all post-doctorals<br />\nwith either full or part-time employment, as well as<br />\nthose who are seeking employment). In that year,<br />\nwomen totaled 21 percent of the labor force in the<br />\nHumanities, and 9 percent of the labor force in Engineering (it should be noted that less than 80 women<br />\nwere awarded engineering doctorates that year).<br />\nBlacks comprise only 1 percent of the Homewood faculty, and none are on the faculty of the School<br />\nof Engineering. The national statistics for blacks are less<br />\ncomplete than those for women, but they still offer<br />\nsome basis for comparison: in the 1978-79 academic<br />\nyear, blacks totaled 3.9 percent of all newPh. D'sawarded that year.<br /><br />\nDepartment are women - others do not;only one teacher<br />\nin the 11-member English Department is a woman. In<br />\ngeneral, we lag behind the national figures.<br />\nBut again, the argument is that the standards for<br />\nHopkins faculty are so high, and so specialized, the our<br />\nfigures cannot be considered in the domain of general<br />\nnational statistics.<br />\n\"You can't compare us with national Ph. D.<br />\npercentages,\" says Yvonne Theodore, the University's<br />\naffirmative action officer. \"Our appointments are more<br />\ndistinctly original and independent research . Their<br />\nindividual academic specialities and research interests fit<br />\nthe objective of the institution and of the individual<br />\ndepartments.\"<br />\nThe philosophy of Affirmative Action here, as<br />\nshaped by the administration and the Academic Council<br />\nand expressed by Ms. Theodore, is perhaps the best explanation of the composition of the Homewood faculty.<br />\nBefore considering that philosophy and its ramifications,<br />\nhowever, it is important to understand, insofar as it is<br />\npossible, what Affirmative Action is and the general way<br />\nin which it functions.<br />\nAffirmative Action is the legal mechanism,<br />\ncreated by a variety of Congressional Acts and Executive<br />\nOrders, which is supposed to ensure equal hiring opportunities for women, minorities, veterans, and handicapped persons. Essentially, it requires institutions<br /><br />\nHopkins.\" But secondly, and perhaps more important,<br />\nthe government apparently recognizes \"good-faith<br />\nefforts\" on the part of the University to accomplish its<br />\ngoals.<br />\n\"It's obvious to them we're giving it a hell of a<br />\ntry,\" Owen says.<br />\nIn other words, the government takes into<br />\naccount Hopkins' objectives and standards as a research<br />\ninstitution, and judges it on the basis of whether or not<br />\nefforts were made to publicize an offered position and<br />\nto delineate to all prospective applicants the necessary<br />\nqualifications.<br />\n\"We've encouraged the departments here to<br />\narticulate their research objectives, made them understand that they have to be active in their recruitment<br />\nefforts,\" Theodore says. \"The University has the right<br />\nto establish fair policies, but policy is not what is at issue<br />\nhere. It's how those policies are practiced, and I believe<br />\nthat the University's policy of excellence does not<br />\nnegate participation of women and minorities, but its<br />\npractices must validate the policy.\"<br />\nSome faculty and former faculty members take a<br />\nmore critical view of the University's hiring record than<br />\nthe government, and fault the philosophy of Affirmative<br />\nAction here on several grounds. First of all, there is the<br />\ncharge that Hopkins is simply too elitist in the enforcement of its standards.<br /><br />\nFaculty or Fiction?<br />\nThere are a variety of defenses for Hopkins' poor which receive government grants and contracts to<br />\nstatistical showing.

The very people<br />\nwho have been excluded become even more excluded<br />\nand are blamed again for their own exclusion.\"<br />\nHarraway, who is now a tenured Associate<br />\nProfessor at the University of California at Santa Cruz,<br />\nargues that the threat of suspended funding for universities who do not meet Affirmative Action standards is<br />\nempty, \"because it's all or nothing - either you cut off<br />\nall federal funds, or you do nothing. And so nothing is<br />\ndone. It's utterly toothless.\"<br />\nTheodore counters that government sanctions are<br />\nboth potent and enforced.<br />\n\"Too few people realize that it's not true that<br />\nthe institution as a whole must falter before sanctions<br />\nare imposed,\" she says. \"If one department warrants<br />\nsanctions, the whole school, the entire University is<br />\nsanctioned. Every federal dollar can be withdrawn. It is<br />\na fact - there are several pending cases where that threat<br />\nhas been real and there is a strong possibility of that<br />\nhappening now - at the University of North Carolina,<br />\nand Berkeley, to name a few.\"<br />\nFinally, there are those who simply reject the<br /><br />\nUniversity's claim that there are not sufficient numbers<br />\nof qualified women and minority applicants for positions here. They regard the numbers of women and<br />\nminorities on the faculty as proof that the University is<br />\nsimply not looking hard enough.<br />\n\"It's true that the size of Hopkins makes it<br />\ndifficult to make dramatic adjustments, but there hasn't<br />\nbeen any concerted effort in this direction,\" says Professor Franklin Knight, Professor of Cuban and Latin<br />\nAmerican social and economic history, and one of two<br />\ntenured blacks at Hopkins. \"[refuse tobelieve there are not<br />\nenough qualified women and minority applicants.

And they argue that the opinions of students,<br />\nanother group of citizens at Hopkins, are also without<br />\nconsequence in these decisions.<br />\nFurther, they charge that other considerations,<br />\noutside but distinctly related to academics, are also<br />\nworking against many candidates. Being female, a<br />\nmember of a minority, or politically active or controversial were factors mentioned by Dr. Harvey as being<br />\nimportant in tenure and promotion denials.<br />\nFinally, they say that \"collegiality\", a feeling<br />\nthat seems to be a cross between academic and personal<br />\nharmony (or lack thereof), plays entirely too large a role<br />\nin promotion and tenure decisions.<br />\nWe will discuss the alleged autocracy and secrecy<br />\nof the faculty, government, and then try to assess these<br />\nother charges by discussing them in the context of five<br />\ncases from the past three years in which candidates were<br />\ndenied tenure or promotion. First, a brief introduction<br />\nto these five former Hopkins faculty is in order<br />\nAlicia Borinsky - Dr. Borinsky along with her<br />\nwas denied tenure last<br />\nhusband, Jeffrey Willman<br />\nyear after each had reached the rank of Associate<br />\nProfessor in the Romance Languages Department.<br />\nBorinsky, who was born in South America and studied<br />\nunder Borges as a child, taught Modern Spanish-American literature and criticism. Both her area of specialization and her own ideas were considered avant-garde by<br />\nmembers of her department. She had published a<br />\nmonograph, and a number of articles at the time of her<br />\nrejection, most of which were in Spanish. Her denial<br />\nwas quite controversial. Students resigned from the<br />\nprogram in response to the decision. Dr. Borinsky now<br />\nteaches at Boston University.<br />\nDonna Haraway - Dr. Haraway was an Assistant<br />\nProfessor in the History of Science Department until she<br />\nwas denied promotion last year. Her case is particularly<br />\nsurprising, in that she was denied after receiving a<br />\nunanimous recommendation from her department.<br />\nHaraway's research concerns itself with the interaction<br />\nbetween the biological sciences, such as neural physiology, and the social sciences such as anthropology. Her<br />\nacademic work was intimately related to her outspoken<br />\nfeminist views: \"I've been trying to understand animal<br />\nsocieties, on a theoretical level, in terms of certain forms<br />\nof political domination.\" She had published a book and<br />\nseveral articles. She led a feminist organization on<br />\ncampus while she was at Hopkins. She is now a tenured<br />\nAssociate Professor at U.C. Santa Cruz.<br /><br />\nRay Kea - Dr. Kea, a black who had taught in<br />\nEurope and Africa, was denied promotion after serving<br />\nfor seven years as an Assistant Professor in the History<br />\nDepartment. He taught African history, and at the time<br />\nof his rejection was completing a history of Africa (later<br />\npublished) based in large part upon indigenous materials,<br />\nsuch as old slave trading records, rather than upon<br />\ntraditional Western views of the continent. Kea now<br />\nteaches at Carleton College in Minnesota.<br />\nRichard Pfeffer - Dr. Pfeffer, a Marxist political<br />\nscientist, was denied tenure two years ago in what was<br />\nprobably the most controversial of any of the denial<br />\ncases. Pfeffer had concentrated primarily on Chinese<br />\nMarxism while he was at Hopkins, but had begun to<br />\nstudy American capitalism betore his denial. His book<br />\nWorking for Capitalism deals with this topic. It documents his seven month experience as a factory worker,<br />\nand contains an analysis of six other well-known books<br />\non labor and capitalism.<br />\nPfeffer was a political activist who publically<br />\ncriticized the University on a number of occasions. Over<br />\n1,500 students voted in a referendum in support of his<br />\nrequest for an appeal of his case, and two deans threatened to resign if the appeal was not granted. The<br />\ncouncil granted the appeal, but later denied Pfeffer<br />\ntenure.<br />\nPfeffer, who had earned a law degree before<br />\ncoming to Hopkins, is now working for Legal Aid<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\nSamuel Weber - Dr. Weber was an Associate<br />\nProfessor in the Humanities Denartment until he was<br />\ndenied tenure last, year. His work here was crossdisciplinary, dealing with a relationship between psychoanalysis and literature. It also questioned certain basic<br />\nnotions, such as traditional definitions of text, and<br />\ntraditional division of subject matter into disciplines.<br />\nWeber was co-founder and co-editor of Glyph, an<br />\ninternational humanities journal originally published by<br />\nthe Hopkins Press. Nearly all of the staff of Glyph,<br />\nwhich included Alicia Borinsky, Jeffrey Mehlman,and a<br />\nnumber of other junior faculty in the languages and<br />\nhumanities, are no longer at Hopkins. Weber himself is<br />\ncurrently teaching at the University of Minnesota,<br />\nalthough he may return to Hopkins in the next' three<br />\nyears.<br />\nHaving met the subjects, let us consider on the<br />\nbasis of their cases the charges leveled against the system.<br />\nThe secrecy of the tenure process, as it prevents<br />\none from finding out a great deal else about tenure at<br />\nHopkins seems the logical place to begin.<br />\nFrom the day the candidate applies, he is supposed to know nothing about who is on the ad hoc<br />\n.committee soliciting evaluations about him or about<br />\nwhat those evaluations say. If he is rejected, he is never<br />\ngiven an official, detailed analysis of why. His only<br />\ninput into the whole process is that he is allowed to<br />\nsubmit a list of names (of people whom he wishes to<br />\nhave solicited for evaluations of his work), which will<br />\ncomprise half of the final list. All information is kept<br />\nsecret form the rest of the Hopkins community as well.<br />\nOnly the department chairman, ad hoc committee, and<br />\nmembers of the Academic Council know the particulars<br />\nof a case.<br />\nThere are two justifications given for this secrecy. First it ensures candid evaluations from colleagues who don't have to worry about the candidate<br />\nknowing their opinions.<br />\n\"Faculty at different universities trade around on<br />\nwriting about each other all the time,\" says Professor<br />\nJack Greene, an advocate of confidentiality despite his<br />\nother criticisms of the processes here. \"I'm writing an<br />\nevaluation of a case coming up at another univeristy<br />\nright now. If I know he'll see it, I won't be able to write<br />\nas open and candid a letter, and I think that few people<br />\nwould be strong enough to do so.\"<br />\nThe other justification is that secrecy protects a<br />\nrejected candidate.<br />\n\"The problem is the negative opinions in denials,\" Professor Walker says. \"If we have to air them<br />\npublicly, it can be very damaging to the candidate's<br />\nchances elsewhere.\"<br />\nThe first justification, that confidentiality<br />\nensures a candid evaluation by colleagues, obviously<br />\nholds true for many professors. They simply feel that<br />\nthey would be unable to write candidly if they knew the<br />\ncandidate was going to see their evaluation.<br />\nThere also professors who, if they do not favor<br />\npublic access to letters, see a pragmatic value in writing<br />\nwith equal candor whether their evaluation is to be<br />\nconfidential or not.<br />\n\"I tend to write things I can sustain, because I<br />\nassume that there is no such thing as a secret letter,\"<br />\nsays Professor Franklin Knight of the History Department. \"I won't say anything I'm unwilling to defend,<br />\nbecause the potential for litigation is great, and people<br />\ncan get hold of anything these days via the Freedom of<br />\nInformation Act.\"<br />\nYet, rejected candidatet are outraged by this<br /><br />\nrationale, especially as most other professions do not<br />\naccord references such protection.<br />\n\"Anybody writing a letter that is going to affect<br />\nthe course of a person's career damn well ought to be<br />\nprepared to defend it,\" says Sam Weber.<br />\nThe second justification, that secrecy -protects<br />\nthe reputation of the rejected candidate, is challenged by<br />\nno one more vigorously than by the rejected candidates<br />\nthemselves.<br />\n\"I was confronted with the reality of unemployment, I think I could have at least been confronted<br />\nwith the reasons why,\" says Ray Kea. \"The reasons<br />\nneedn't be made public, but they could at least have told<br />\nme. I suppose that would be asking too much, since it is<br />\none's life.\"<br />\nIn general, there is a sense of frustration among<br />\nproud, intellectually dedicated people at not being able<br />\nto at least know why they are being rejected.<br />\n\"I'm not about to sit here and say that there are<br />\nno grounds for criticism of my work,\" Donna Haraway<br />\nsays. \"But one doesn't have access to the process, to the<br />\nreasons for decision, which I resent most strongly. I<br />\nhave a lot of questions, and no way of knowing the<br />\nanswers to them.\"<br />\nThose in faculty government feel that such<br />\nquestions are unnecessary. They believe they use<br />\nsecrecy judiciously, and that it is a safe tool in academic<br />\nhands.<br />\n\"Universities have their own constitutionality,<br />\nand they needn't adhere to other forms.\" says History<br />\nDepartment Chairman Mack Walker. \"These decisions<br />\nare made by honest people, not by political pushovers.\"<br />\nAnd Romance Languages Department Chairman<br />\nPaul Olson adds,\"I won't deny that secrecy can be used<br />\nfor improper purposes, but I don't think that happens<br />\nhere, because faculty are the ultimate authority.\"<br />\nHowever, their critics feel that secrecy at the<br />\nvery least is a possible point of departure for abuses in<br />\nother areas.<br />\n\"Secrecy raises serious questions about the<br />\nestablishment of democratic controls,\" says Sam Weber.<br />\n\"A small group has access to all the facts, and those who<br />\nare non-tenured and object have no way to verify<br />\nanything. It's a very fundamental issue, since it intervenes at the point you would try to find out about<br />\nanything else.\"<br />\nAt this point, the reader who is skeptical of these<br />\nimplications of skullduggery may ask,\"What else is there<br />\nto find out? What evidence is there to indicate that<br />\nanything at all questionable has happened?\"<br />\nThe answers are that most people are not sure<br />\nwhat there is to find out, and that there is little factual<br />\nevidence of questionable happenings. In gathering<br />\ninformation for this article, we were given a great many<br />\nsubjective descriptions of the kind of power play tactics<br />\nthe system here is open to. The tactics described were<br />\nallegedly used in a variety of situations, and for a variety<br />\nof different reasons, and they offer an interesting<br />\nglimpse at the way the power structure at Hopkins may<br />\nreally work. We stress here again that we cannot verify<br />\nthese allegations; further, that many of the people<br />\nmaking the allegations qualify them with the statement<br />\nthat the system at Hopkins is no worse, and in some<br />\ncases actually better, than systems at other institutions,<br />\nand that the system in general is as good a system as<br />\nthey can envision. Nevertheless, they make the following<br />\nallegations:<br />\n-That personal whim and politics, whatever the<br />\nmotivation, is a built-in condition of the system: This is<br />\nstated by tenured faculty here, as well as by the system's<br />\ncasualties.<br />\n\"To get tenure here, it's important not to offend<br />\npowerful departmental types, especially the chairman.\"<br />\nsays Professor David Harvey. \"The decisions are often<br />\ndictated by power plays within the departments. Times<br />\nare tighter, and people are protecting their empires here.<br />\nIf they expand them, it will be at somebody else's<br />\nexpense.\"<br />\nEduardo Saccone, a tenured professor in the<br />\nRomance Languages, concurs. \"It's a serious question<br />\nwhether or not a department can function with people<br />\nwho are unable to get along,\" he says. \"The element has<br />\nits weight in decisions. It's an unjust element perhaps,<br />\nbut it probably can't be avoided. And it's a terrible<br />\nthing, but the people who are more powerful may get<br />\ntheir way.\"<br />\nMarc Blum, a Baltimore attorney who has<br />\nworked on a number of tenure cases (some in connection with Hopkins) corroborates these comments with a<br />\nmore detailed analysis.<br />\n\"In all of these situations, there is always going<br />\nto be a chairman or a 'star' in the department whom<br />\neveryone knows it really the arbiter in the decision,\" he<br />\nsays. \"If you are less than truly excellent, and you<br />\ndisplease or irritate that star-- if you criticize a lesser,<br />\na professor who is in the department to support the star,<br />\nor if you simply don't get along and are not good<br />\nenough that people are willing to put up with what they<br />\npersonally don't like about you\u2014that star is going to get<br /><br />\nNOVEMBER 14, 1980/ PAGE 12<br />\nscont.from p. 11<br />\nyou at tenure time.<br />\nBlum describes academia as a profession which is<br />\ndeceptive and hard to classify in terms of its tolerance of<br />\n\"idyncratic behavior\" on the part ofits employees. In business,<br />\nfor example,you can<br />\nbe judged on the bottom line of the<br />\nnet amount you contributed to the company's profits,<br />\nand it it was enough, people will put up with you. But<br />\nacademia has no bottom line, and you are rated on other<br />\npeople's subjective judgements. Everything you do is<br />\nimportant, from the kinds of articles you publish to the<br />\nway you handle yourself at the lunch-table at the<br />\nHopkins Club.\"<br />\nThose who were denied tenure and promotion<br />\nhere testify to these descriptions in the way they speak<br />\nof their own experiences.<br />\nRay Kea says, \"When I was at Hopkins, I was<br />\nunder the mistaken belief that you did what you were<br />\npaid to do. But I was naive. It turned out that all the<br />\nMachaivellian behind-the-scenes activity was just as<br />\nimportant.\"<br />\nThe general response by those who hold power<br />\nto these allegations is best expressed by Professor Paul<br />\nOlson, Borinsky's chairman in the Romance Languages<br />\nDepartment.<br />\n\"Considerations of personality, or of anything<br />\nother than scholarship, are unimportant,\" he says. \"The<br />\nbottom line in these decisions is the evaluation of the<br />\ncandidate by outside opinions. Mere gossip has no place<br />\nin the serious business of decision making.\"<br />\nIn other words,as it is at the hiring level, scholarship is cited by the university as the most important<br />\ncriteria in promotion and tenure decisions. It is necessary, then, to consider what the university's definition of<br />\nscholarship is, for critics charge that scholarship is<br />\ndefined so narrowly here as to exclude many valid but<br />\nnon-traditional view points and methodologies.<br />\nScholarship, in a general sense, is a teacher's<br />\nindependent work in his field: his research, books,and<br />\npublications in academic journals, his original contributions to the field. Those in the decision-making roles<br />\nhere make no bones about the fact that this institution<br />\nputs a very high premium on research, as opposed to<br />\nteaching.<br />\n\"I would have to say that if someone is an<br />\nunquestionably superb research scholar and only a<br />\nmoderately successful teacher, that person would have<br />\nan excellent chance of getting promotion or tenure,\"<br />\nsays university President Dr. Steven Muller. \"On the<br />\nother hand, if someone is a brilliantly successful teacher,<br />\nbut only moderately successful on the research side, that<br />\nperson would find much greater difficulty in being<br />\nappointed.\"<br />\nThe prevailing view, however, is that great<br />\nscholarship ensures great teaching by means of the<br />\n\"trickle-down\" effect.<br />\n\"The primary jewel in this university's crown is<br />\nits faculty, one that is actively writing, publishing, and<br />\ngoing to conferences,\" says Stanley Fish, a tenured<br />\nprofessor in the English Department. \"This automatically means, to a certain degree, an exciting classroom<br />\natmosphere.\"<br />\nCritics, speaking from their own experience,<br />\ntranslate this to mean that teaching is given virtually no<br />\nweight at all. if teaching matters at all, how could it<br />\nnot have pushed me over the top,\" Richard Pfeffer asks<br />\nbitterly. The overwhelming student turnout at the<br />\nreferendum on his behalf indicated the undergraduate's<br />\nopinion of his teaching, as did a 1975 school-wide<br />\nStudent Council survey on student opinion of teachers.<br />\nThe survey (conducted by the 1975 Student Council)<br />\nawarded Pfeffer scores of 3.8 and 3.6, the highest score<br />\never, according to the report,and credited him as having<br />\n\"the respect of every undergraduate who has ever taken<br />\na course with him.\"<br />\nThe same survey awarded History Professor, Ray<br />\nKea a score of 3.4,described him as \"well-liked and well<br />\nrespected by undergraduates\u2014 and credited him with<br />\nhandling \"a huge teaching load.\" In fact, the report<br />\naccused the History Department of \"...offering one<br />\ncourse per semester per appointment.\" and of succeeding in this practice by means of the \"amazing teaching<br />\nload (assumed) by the associate and especially the<br />\nassistant professors. who must take up all the slack<br />\nfor those professors who are not teaching.\"<br />\nClearly. teaching is not being given even the<br />\nminimal priority officially accorded it. Alicia Borinsky,<br />\ntoo, was highly regarded by her students, so much so<br />\nthat five graduate students who had been working<br />\nclosely with her resigned from the Hopkins languages<br />\nMaster program in protest of her tenure denial. Donna<br />\nHaraway evaluated as an excellent teacher in a survey<br />\nlast year. Of our five former faculty members whom we<br />\nhave been discussing in this article, only Samuel Weber<br />\nwas not especially known for his classroom performance<br />\nbut he was specifically known for his work on improving<br />\nthe undergraduate curriculum offerings.<br />\nImplicit in this failure to recognize teaching is a<br />\nfailure to recognize student voice in evaluating teachers.<br /><br />\nSome members of faculty government, such Professor<br />\nWalker and Dean Susskind, say that student opinion is<br />\nnoted,d if not by any official means, and taken into<br />\nOthers, however, state quite frankly that<br />\nstudents at Hopkins have almost no say in what will be<br />\nfacing them in the classroom.<br />\n\"At some universities, there is student participation on tenure committees, but I would be categorically<br />\nagainst that here in any way shape or form,\" say Professor Fish. \"I can understand why students would want<br />\nthat kind of participation, but it's perfectly mysterious<br />\nto me why the faculty would want to give it to them.<br />\nI'm not saying that students aren't the best judges for<br />\nthemselves, but they are another political class whose<br />\ninterests don't always dovetail with ours. It's just not in<br />\na faculty member's interest to give up to students the<br />\nprocedure by which he is selected, promoted, and<br />\ntenured. I've known faculty who would give it up, but<br />\nhappily not here.\"<br />\nWeber himself makes no accusations against the<br />\nuniversity, beyond his criticism of the secrecy of the<br />\nprocess. He concedes that he has heard rumors concerning people's motives for seeking his rejection, but says<br />\nhe is not in a position to comment on them because he<br />\ndoesn't know the facts. However, he offers some<br />\nconjectures about what aspects of his work might have<br />\ngotten him in trouble. He mentions Glyph the internation journal he co-founded and co-editied\u2014and interesting comment, in that the publication seems to be the<br />\nideal achievement that a junior faculty member could<br />\nproduce to strengthen his or her case at research-oriented, publishing-conscious Hopkins.<br />\n\"Although each person's case was different, I<br />\ndon't think its an accident that none of the original<br />\npeople from Glyph are still at Hopkins:' he says. \"I<br />\ndon't mean to suggest a diabolical plan, but it does<br />\nreflect the atmosphere. We were not a dogmatic group,<br />\nbut we did take a sufficiently identifiable position, and<br />\nany time you take an identifiable position on theoretical<br />\nissues, it's going to win you friends and enemies.\"<br />\nWeber himself says that his own ideas question<br />\nthe traditional definition of literature, in a way which<br />\ncould effect the traditional structuring of academic<br />\ndisciplines and departments. \"I suppose that might have<br />\nthreatened some people,\" he says. But he adds that<br />\nneither his ideas nor those of anyone on the staff of<br />\nGlyph were \"controversial beyond sonic basic controversies in the Humanities.\"<br />\nWeber is especially critical of the circumstances<br />\nwhich caused the departures or rejections of most of the<br />\nstaff of Glyph, who included Alicia Borinsky, her<br />\nhusband Jeffrey Mehlman, Rodolphe Gasche and Louis<br />\nMann of the Romance Languages Department, and<br />\nHenry Sussman and Carol Jacobs (husband and wife)of<br />\nthe Humanities Center.<br />\n\"All of these people were more or less forced to<br />\ngo, which was unjust in terms of their academic and<br />\nintellectual credentials,\" he says. \"They were all good<br />\nenough to merit tenure. Their presence was a valuable<br />\nasset to Hopkins, and their departure was unfortunate.\"<br />\nNo one the News-Letter has spoken to has<br />\noffered a clear criticism of Weber's scholarship which<br />\nmight have been the basis for his tenure denial. Dean<br />\nSusskind offers a general rationale which seems to be the<br />\nmost plausible that is applicable to the Weber case,<br />\nthough the Dean was not refering to Weber at the time.<br />\n\"A candidate can be doing interesting work in<br />\nX,Y, and Z, but the work may have no relation to his<br />\nsupposed area of concentration,\" the dean says. \"We<br />\ncan't promote him on the basis of work that isn't in his<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nAlicia Borinsky is much more vehement in her<br />\ncondemnation of the university's handling of her case.<br />\nShe charges, first of all, that there were prejudices<br />\nagainst her area of study\u2014 modern Latin American<br />\nliterature.<br />\n\"People regarded it as peripheral, less important,\" she says. \"They've relegated it in that department<br />\nto a position where it will never be taught by anyone but<br />\na junior faculty member.\"<br />\nBorinsky argues that one important reason that<br />\nthe quality of her work was not recognized is that no<br />\none else in the department,other than the chairman, was<br />\nproficient in reading Spanish.<br />\n\"I don't know if my work would be considered<br />\ncontroversial or not,\" she says. \"But I don't think that's<br />\nthe issue. I don't think anyone in that department ever<br />\ngot to the point of reading any of my work.\"<br />\nHowever, Professor Paul Olson, Borinsky's<br />\nChairman in the Department of Romance Languages,<br />\ncounters that the candidate's work was read and understood.<br />\n\"Her field was in avant-garde literature, using<br />\ncritical language in a critical mode, but it was not such<br />\ntechnical language that only a specialist could understand it,\" he says.<br />\nOlson adds that one factor working against<br />\nBorinsky was her compartively small record of publication.<br /><br />\n\"It would be inappropriate to say that Dr.<br />\nBorinsky did not have sufficient competencher field to<br />\nmerit a position in the profession,\" he says. \"It simply<br />\nwasn't sufficient, in our opinion, to merit a position<br />\nhere.\"<br />\nBorinsky's case, in particular, stunned a number<br />\nof professor's at Hopkins who were familiar with and<br />\nthought highly of her work.<br />\n\"I wrote to the Academic Council independently<br />\non her behalf, because I felt she was not given due<br />\nprocess,\" says Professor Franklin Knight. \"It was<br />\ninconceivable to me that someone of that stature would<br />\nbe denied tenure. I was appalled that they thought her<br />\nnot sufficiently qualified to be a Hopkins scholar.\"<br />\nAnd Professor John Barth of the Writing Seminars Department comments, \"I was very sorry to see<br />\nBorinsky go; she presided over the boom at Hopkins in<br />\ncontemporary Latin-American fiction, perhaps the most<br />\ninteresting phenomenon in the second half of this<br />\ncentury.\"<br />\nThe cases of Borinsky and Weyer do not demonstrate anything<br />\nthe extremely high and<br />\nsomewhat changeable<br />\nmoreh<br />\ntstaan dard of scholarship the<br />\nBut Borinsky<br />\nuniversity enforces.<br />\nsets her own case in the context of the general upheaval<br />\nin the Romance languages and Humanities Departments and argues that her own case was part of a general pattern.<br />\n\"The staff of Glyph was forced out as a result of<br />\nthe incapacity of certain senior professors to co-exist<br />\nwith young,actively publishing junior faculty,\" she says.<br />\n\"And in the case of the Romance Languages Department, the chairman there (Professor Olson) presided<br />\nover the departure of a great many people-- Professor<br />\nRivers, Mann, Paris, Gashe, myself, and my husband-whether some of us were fired, or left because of the<br />\natmosphere. So it was not just a case of a nice community getting rid of two trouble-makers-- myself and<br />\nmy husband\u2014 but a case of a community systematically<br />\ngetting rid of a great deal of people. From any professional standpoint,that's a failed chairmanship.\"<br />\nOlson rejects these charges, saying that each<br />\nfaculty member left for an entirely different reason than<br />\nthe other, some, like Louis Mann, entirely of their own<br />\naccord and against the wishes of the department.<br />\n\"It may seem like an alibi, to say that we've had<br />\none form of bad luck after another,\" he says,\"and when<br />\nyou've. had that kind of luck, people begin to suspect<br />\nyou deserve it\u2014 but its true we've simply had bad luck.<br />\nWe're optimistic about rebuilding now.\"<br />\nOf all the teachers who left the Romance Languages Department, the News-Letter was able to reach<br />\nonly one, Professor Rivers, now chairman of the Languages Department at the State University of New York<br />\nat Stonybrook. Rivers confirmed<br />\nthat<br />\nhe<br />\nhad left \"for personal reasons\", but added that *his<br />\ndeparture, and that of others', was a resonse to an<br />\natmosphere created by \"vindictive attempts to get rid of<br />\ndissident elements.\"<br />\nOther candidates who were denied tenure or<br />\npromotion feel that their political activism both outside<br />\nand inside Hopkins \u2014 their emphasis on a practical<br />\napplication of their own teachings -- was the cause of<br />\ntheir rejection.<br />\n\"I think that one of the things that links some of<br />\nus who have been eliminated from Hopkins is our refusal<br />\nto separate the dimensions of theory and practise in our<br />\nwork,\" says Donna Haraway. \"I think that my work<br />\nought to be fundamentally accoutable to the women's<br />\nmovement, but that's going to create a lot of contradictions in everyday work within the university. I was<br />\nexplicitly identified as a feminist on the campus, the<br />\nsame way that Ric (Pfeffer) was identified as a Marxist.<br />\nAnd you look at your life in a professional institution,<br />\nand you say, 'this professional institution is in many<br />\nways corrupt, and serve power interests which dominate me and others. And at the same time, your work is<br />\ndirected as a critique against domination. When you<br />\nturn that into the content of your work,the university is<br />\ngoing to see that as going too far.\"<br />\nOnce again, the university's response is that any<br />\nviewpoint or methodology of scholarship is acceptable<br />\nprovided it meets the university's standeards of excellence.<br />\n\"I'm certainly not uncomfortable knowing that<br />\nsomebody on the faculty is a Marxist, any more than I<br />\nam uncomfortabl e knowing that somebody is a monetarist, or a monarchist, for all I care,\" says President<br />\nMuller, \"but I feel that those are not criteria with which<br />\nyou make your judgements. The question is, is that<br />\nperson a major contributor in his or her field?\"<br />\nActivists question whether the university is really<br />\ncapable of such an openminded approach, especially<br />\nwhen its own \"ideology\" is being challenged.<br />\n\"The faculty at Hopkins doesn't think of itself as<br />\nhaving an ideology, but it does-- it simply can't recognize<br />\nits own world-view,\" says Richard Pfeffer. \"They don't<br />\nhave to conspire against someone who is outside of their<br />\nframework, they can go through a common thoughtprocess instead which will produce the same result.<br />\ncont. on p. 15<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 13<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS SOCIAL COMMITTEF<br /><br />\nCitizen Kane<br /><br />\nPRESENTS<br /><br />\nRecording artists<br /><br />\nFRIDAY 9:00<br />\nSATURDAY 7:00 &amp; 11:00<br />\nGeneral Admission<br />\n$2.00 single show<br />\n$3.00 double feature<br /><br />\nKIT WATKINS &amp; COCO ROUSSEZ<br /><br />\nStudents<br />\n$1.50 single show<br />\n$2.50 double feature<br /><br />\nHAPPY THE<br />\nMAN II<br /><br />\nSenior Class Film Series presents<br />\nNovember 14&amp; 15<br />\nFriday &amp; Saturday<br />\nShaffer 3<br /><br />\nA unique blend of electronic and<br />\npercussive jazz-rock<br /><br />\nThe Adventures<br />\nOf Robin Hood<br /><br />\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21 at 8:30 P.M.<br />\nin the Listening/Viewing Room<br /><br />\nFRIDAY 7:00 &amp; 11:00<br />\nSATURDAY 9:00<br /><br />\nADMISSION: S3.50 vi/College<br />\nS4.00 General Admission<br /><br />\nThe Office of 111 00<br /><br />\nthe Chaplain<br />\nFRANCIS FORD COPPOLA<br />\nPRESENT<br />\nS<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nFriday Nov. 14(0) Saturday Nov. 15<br />\n7:30 S 10:30 P.M.

It is a competent production, its<br />\nstrengths balanced by its weaknesses.<br />\nOne of the shortcomings of the<br />\nply which is difficult to overcome is the<br />\nplay itself. The story seems to be merely<br />\na rehash of Who's Afraid of Virginia<br />\nWoolfl2 cast with slightly different characters but centering on the same situation:<br />\nstrife between family members, friends,<br />\nand marriage partners, and the problem<br />\nof where to draw the line. Sure, there are<br />\nsome interesting elements not present in<br />\nVirginia Woolf--the omnipresent liquor<br />\ncabinet which is the dominant prop; the<br />\nscenaril of the old couple, Harry and<br />\nEdna, who drop by one evening because<br />\nof some mysterious, unexplained fear,<br /><br />\nand then lock themselves in one of the<br />\nbedrooms and refuse to come out--but a<br />\nfew interesting ideas doth not a good play<br />\nmake, and Albee wrote pretty much the<br />\nsame play before. Self-plagarism is an<br />\nunpardonable sin of writing, especially<br />\nwhen the clone (A Delicate Balance) fails<br />\nto equal or surpass the original (Who's<br />\nAfraid of Virginia Woolf?). In addition,<br />\nAlbee unashamedly violates Chekov's rule<br />\nof writing, \"If there is a gun on the<br />\nmantlepiece in the first act, be sure that it<br />\nhas been fired by the end of the second.\"<br />\nTobias, one of the main characters, muses<br />\nabout shooting the entire family in their<br />\nsleep, and in another scene Julia his<br />\ndaughter, threatens Harry and Edna with<br />\na Luger. Nothing is really ever done with<br />\na gun, though, so it becomes an unnecessary red herring. Another loose end is<br />\nthe constant mention of Tobias and<br />\nAgnes' dead son, which does nothing to<br />\nfurther the plot or characterizations<br />\nsignificantly and is therefore superfluous.<br />\nDespite these drastic fubars, though, the<br />\nplay' is 'better-than-adequate drama, so it<br /><br />\nby Charles Dikkenss (\"two k's; the<br />\nwell-known Dutch author\") and Ethel the<br />\nAardvark Goes Quantity-Surveying. It is<br />\nbits like this one that have been the main<br />\njustification for Python's cult status, and<br />\nthat put the rest of Monty Python's<br />\nContractual Obligation Album to shame<br /><br />\nWoody Allen<br />\nSide Effects, Woody Allen's third<br />\nvolume of prose pieces, is a wildly uneven<br />\ncollection: funny, often hilarious in<br />\nspots, but ultimately unsatisfying. While<br />\nmatured admirably in<br />\nhas<br />\nAllen<br />\nrecent years as a filmmaker, his<br />\nstagnated;<br />\nfiction seems to have<br />\nanyone familiar with \"Annie Hall\" or<br />\n\"Manhattan\" knows how incisive his film<br />\ncomedy has become, but most of the<br />\nstories that comprise Side Effects still<br />\nrely heavily on the same tired jokes about<br />\nsex, death, and philosophy that can be<br />\nfound in only slightly different form in<br />\nAllen's nightclub routines, his early films,<br />\nor the books Getting Even and Without<br />\nFeathers.<br />\nNot that sex, death, and philosophy aren't funny. On the contrary,<br />\nAllen is one of few writers whose material<br />\nhas that rare quality of making the reader<br />\nlaught out loud. \"Needleman was not<br />\nan easily understood man,\" he writes in<br />\n\"Remembering Needleman.\" \"His reticence was mistaken for coldness, but he<br />\nwas capable of great compassion, and<br />\nafter witnessing a particularly horrible<br />\nmine disaster once, he could not finish a<br />\nsecond helping of waffles.\" In \"The UFO<br />\nMenace,\" he relates the story of Sir<br />\nChester Ramsbottom who, while driving,<br />\nclaimed to have seen \"a cigar-shaped<br />\nobject\" tracking his car. \"Upon investigation, experts determined that the<br />\n'cigar-shaped object' Was Sir Chester's<br />\nnose. Naturally, all his evasive actions<br />\ncould not lose it, since it was attached to<br />\nhis face.\"<br />\nOther bright spots in Side Effects<br />\nare \"My Apology,\" a parody of the<br />\nimprisonment and subsequent execution<br />\nof Socrates; \"The Kugelmass Episode,\"<br />\nthe story of a humanities professor<br />\nwho hires a magician to propel him<br />\nbackward in time so that he can have an<br />\naffair with Madam Bovary ;\"A Giant Step<br />\nfor Mankind,\" a speculative account of<br />\nthe scientific research leading up to the<br /><br />\ndiscovery of the Heimlich hug; and \"The<br />\nQuery,\" a one-act play concerning<br />\n.Abraham Lincoln's dubious response to<br />\nthe question: \"How long should a man's<br />\nlegs be?\"<br />\nThere are two pieces in which<br />\nAllen attempts greater cohesion through<br />\ncloser adherence to standard short-story<br />\nformulae. One,\"Retribution,\" deals with<br />\nthe dilemma faced by a man who falls in<br />\nlove with his girlfriend's mother. \"The<br />\nShallowest Man,\" probably the book's<br />\nmost effective selection, is the tale of<br />\nLenny Mendel, a man forced by obligation and peer pressure..to visit a remote<br />\nacquaintance, Iskowitz, who is dying of<br />\ncancer. At the hospital, he develops a<br />\ncrush on Iskowitz's nurse, and from then<br />\non visits every day, feigning sympathy for<br />\nIskowitz only to gain the nurse's good<br />\nfavor. Months later, unaware of Mendel's<br />\nulterior motives, Iskowitz dies a grateful<br />\nman, and Mendel starts dating the nurse.<br />\nBut these two stories are the only<br />\nparallels Side Effects offers us to Allen's<br />\ngrowth as a director and screenwriter.<br />\nFor the most part, these pieces (written<br />\nbetween 1975 and 1980 and published<br />\nprimarily in The New Yorker, The New<br />\nRepublic, and The Kenyon Review) are<br />\nonly shadows of Allen's genius. This fact,<br />\nconsidered together with the book's<br />\nlength (150 pages) and the throw-away or<br />\nfiller quality of some of the stories,<br />\ncontributes to an overall feeling of<br />\ndisappointment with the book as a whole,<br />\nespecially for the person who has parted<br />\nwith nine dollars to read it.<br />\nIf you appreciate Woody Allen<br />\n(and you have the nine dollars), there is<br />\nmuch to recommend Side.Effects. It<br />\ncontains enough one-liners and anecdotes<br />\nto make you the life of your next pseudointellectual bull session; however, you<br />\nmay find yourself searching in vain for<br />\nanything more.<br /><br />\n1/\\IR Si<br />\nstill retains some entertainment value.<br />\nThe quality of the acting differs<br />\nfrom character to character and scene to<br />\nscene. The two primary characters,<br />\nTobias (Robert Walsh) and Agnes (Ruth<br />\nWalsh) seem very wooden and lifeless at<br />\nthe beginning of the play (Yes, I realize<br />\nthat the theme of the play is the emptiness of bourgeois life, but that is no<br />\nexcuse for bland, stiff acting). The first<br />\nscenes are droll to the point of near<br />\ncatatonia, and it is difficult to discern<br />\nwhether the dialogue is wistful or sarcastic. The Walshes performances steadily<br />\nincrease in quality as the \u2022play progresses,<br />\nalmost as if acting in.this production were<br />\nanalogous to trying on a glove. Ruth<br />\nWalsh fills out her rolo well, hut her<br /><br />\nhusband Robert's basso rotunda voice<br />\nand stentorian inflections are more<br />\napropos to a banking commercial than to<br />\nAlbee. After reading the play and comparing it to his interpretation of the<br />\ncharacter, it does not appear that Walsh<br />\nsatisfied Albee's intentions for the<br />\ncharacter, a man of more depth than<br />\nWalsh portrays him 'as having. Admittedly, the Walshes are not Tracey and<br />\nHepburn, but their acting is still good,<br />\nalbeit slightly off the mark, and the<br />\nblame for the problems probably falls<br />\nupon the director rn<br />\nthan the actors.<br />\nThe other characters Care much better.<br />\nHarry and Edna (Milton Freedman and<br />\nMary Stewart) are pen,<br />\n:ctly cast. Freed,()<br /><br />\ncont.from. p. 12<br />\nWithin the liberal framework the only thing they can<br />\nlegitimately say about work that violates their ideology<br />\nis that it is bad scholarsbip.

Is someone going to move up<br />\nthe heirarchy who says witchdoctory is quackery?\"<br />\nPfeffer points to what he sees as the limited<br />\nrange of viewpoints currently offered by the Hopkins<br />\ntenured political science department as a manifestation<br />\nof the university's ideological framework.<br />\n\"They cover politics in this country with studies<br />\nof the courts, the Congress, the political parties, the<br />\nbureaucracy, and the Presidency,\" he says. \"It's very<br />\ntraditional, although, that's not necessarily bad. But<br />\nthere's no sense that maybe we shouldn't study politics<br />\nby using catagories that simply reflect the institutions<br />\nexactly as they are handed to us-- for example they have<br />\nno one teaching the politics of work. If you want to<br />\nunderstand the political life of a country, you need to<br />\nunderstand the day to day life of its people. Daily life is<br />\na struggle for most people in America, and the University doesn't teach about that.\"<br />\nWhereas \"poor scholarship\" is a shaky rationale<br />\nin the rejection of Donna Haraway\u2014a unanimous<br />\nrecommendation from her department speaks loudly\u2014 it<br />\nis at least more of an open possibility in Pfeffer's case.<br />\nAt the time of his denial, Pfeffer had published one<br />\nbook,Working For Capitalism. A fascinating account of<br />\nhis seven month experience operating a trash forklift in a<br />\nBaltimore factory, the book is nevertheless predominantly \"unacademic\" in its approach (save for a final<br />\ndiscussion of literature on working.) Pfeffer theorizes<br />\nextemporaneously throughout the book based on<br />\njournal entry accounts of his daily experiences in the<br />\nfactory. There are no footnotes, no appeal to the traditional academic authority. The book received strong<br />\npraise from NoamChomsky, the noted scholar, and from<br />\nMaryland congressman Parren Mitchell, but it was also<br />\npanned by a number of field experts.<br />\nThus Pfeffer's scholarship was open to question,<br />\nat least according tizi traditional standards. But it is also<br />\ntrue that his politics, particularly as manifested on<br />\ncampus, antagonized the university on a number of<br />\noccasions.<br />\nDuring the Vietnam War, he led a student strike<br />\nagainst on-campus recruiting for the military. He was<br />\ninvestigated, and later cleared, by the deans at that time<br />\nfor inciting violence. In February of 1975, he led a<br />\nvocal protest against the university's decision to award<br />\nan honorary degree to the sister of the Shah of Iran.

MEYER<br />\nWednesday night, the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony Orchestra presented the third<br />\nin its series of Midweek \"Celebrity\"<br />\nconcerts under the direction of its musical director, Sergiu Comissiona. The<br />\nopening work in this all-French concert<br />\nwas Maurice Ravel's Rapsodie Espagnole.<br />\nDivided into four short yet continuous<br />\nmovements, the Rapsodie can be a<br />\ndazzling orchestral showpiece. Maestro<br />\nComissiona's slow tempi heightened the<br />\nmysterious qualities of the opening<br />\nmovement, Prelude a la nuit, a stunning<br />\norchestral tone painting in the Impressionist style. However, these same slow<br />\ntempi disrupted the flow of the work and<br />\n,,nade it seem more disjointed than it<br />\nreally is. Comissiona was not helped by<br />\nthe sometimes ragged playing of the<br />\nviolins nor the muted sound of the<br />\nbrass.<br />\nMusical matters improved with<br />\nthe appearance of the featured soloist,<br />\nYo-Yo Ma,for a performance of the Cello<br />\nConcerto of Edouard Lab. Mr. Ma<br />\npossesses an extremely warm and vibrant<br />\nsound which was demonstrated to good<br />\neffect. The work itself is another story.<br />\nWritten in 1876 and possessing neither<br />\nthe exoticism of Massenet nor the wit of<br />\nSaint-Saens, it displays the worst French<br />\nConservatoire style. The Orchestra did its<br />\nbest and there was a good rapport be-1<br /><br />\ntween them and Ma. Following a short<br />\nspeech of appreciation to Joseph and<br />\nRebecca Meyerhoff for their endowment<br />\nof the Principal Cellist's Chair, Ma returned to play one of the Boccherini cello<br />\nduets with Mihaly Virizaly, the BSO's<br />\nprincipal cellist.<br />\nThe Orchestra's program concluded with the Symphony No. 3 in C<br />\nMinor, the \"Organ\" Symphony, of<br />\nCamille Saint-Saens. Dedicated to the<br /><br />\nSergiu Comissiona conducts BSO<br /><br />\nmemory of Franz Liszt and written on<br />\na commission from the London Philharmonic, it is Saint-Saens' most ambitious<br />\norchestral work, combining a large<br />\norchestra with piano and organ to splendid effect. Although it is divided into<br />\ntwo parts, the- symphony still retains the<br />\ntraditional four-movement form, with the<br />\norgan entering in the second and fourth<br />\nmovements. The first two movements<br />\nwere magnificent, with the BSO strings<br />\nplaying with a silkiness previously unheard this season. The strings were also<br />\nat their best for the last two movements,<br />\nbut the brass, as in ,the Ravel, was<br />\nstrangely muted.<br />\nThe instrument that prevented the<br />\nperformance from being a total success<br />\nwas the organ. Since the Lyric Theatre<br />\ndoes not have a house organ\u2014nor will the<br />\nnew Symphony Hall, for that matter\u2014<br />\nthe Symphony borrowed an Allen Digital<br />\nOrgan from the manufacturer for this<br />\nseries of performances. It was loud! It<br />\nwas also one of the ugliest sounding<br />\ninstruments it has ever been my misfortune to hear, with piercing upper registers<br />\nthat completely destroyed the finale of<br />\nthe work. Today the Symphony will be<br />\nrecording the Saint-Saens Third for<br />\nVanguard and for that at least, this<br />\nreviewer hopes, they will be allowed the<br />\nopportunity to work with an instrument<br />\nthat is fitting for Maestro Comissiona's<br />\ngrand conception of the work.<br /><br />\nRobert Walsh as Tobias<br /><br />\nDelicate Balance<br />\ncont. from p. 14<br />\nman,an obvious graduate of the Ed Wynn<br />\nSchool of Thespianism, plays the frightened, confused Harry superbly; Stewart,<br />\nwith her squeaky spinster's voice which<br />\nstabs the air like a sharpened knitting<br />\nneedle, deserves equal credit. Judy<br />\nShannon as Claire, Agnes's sister, an<br />\nalcoholic whose cynicism is directed at<br />\nherself as often as at the outside world,<br />\nshow a superior understanding of her<br />\nrole, which is unfortunately limited<br />\nby its stereotypicality. Lastly, Sarah<br />\nLord's rendition of Julia, Agnes' and<br />\nTobias' daugher, is good, but she continually falls back on the same gesture of<br />\nanguish: arms akimbo, palms outward,'<br />\nand voicing a loud \"O0000www!!\"<br />\nreminiscent of the policeman in the Our<br />\nGang comedies. This weakness, however,<br />\nis balanced by her finesse when in hysterics, the only other mental state which<br />\nAlbee ascribes ,to the character. Again,<br />\njust to the right of the mean.<br />\nThe best one-word description<br />\none can give to this production is \"adequate.\"<br />\nIt is worth seeing (mostly<br />\nbecause this particular play is not performed that often), but don't expect to<br />\nbe dazzled.<br /><br />\nFourth Place MAC Finish<br /><br />\nSoccer Squad Ends Alright After Sorry Start<br />\nBY STEVEN EISENBERG<br />\n\"They wanted to give it to<br />\nus, but we wouldn't take it,\"<br />\nsays coach Bob Oliver about his<br />\nteam's 3-0 loss to UMBC this<br />\npast Saturday.<br />\nEssentially, this statement<br />\ndescribes most of Hopkins' soccer games. After losing 3-1 to<br />\nHaverford openingday, the Blue<br />\nJays bounced back and beat<br />\na Division I Georgetown team.<br />\nBut the team then lost eight<br />\nconsecutive games before winning three straight over Widener,<br />\nWashington College, and Gettysburg. After last Saturday's final<br />\ngame, the team finished with a<br />\n4-10 overall record, but still<br />\nmanaged a fourth place finish in<br />\nthe conference with a 2-3<br />\nrecord.<br />\n\"When you're down 1-9,<br />\nyou're looking to change, hopefully for the better,\" said coach<br />\nOliver about his team's disappointing start. Throughout the<br />\nearly season, the position of<br />\nsome players changed, but it was<br />\nnot until the original 4-3-3<br />\nallignment was altered prior to<br />\nthe Widener victory that the<br />\nteam started to win, taking three<br />\nof its last four games. \"The<br />\nprior changes just didn't seem to<br />\nwork.\"<br />\nMost teams are presently<br />\nutilizing the 4-2-4 alignment,<br />\nsince it gives more scoring<br />\npunch.
