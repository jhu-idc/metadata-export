The Seniors had a<br />\nTHE PUBLIC DEBATE.<br />\n<br />\nF<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nrecord to sustain, for they had the honor last<br />\nyear of defeating the team of 1900. The Juniors<br />\nwere desirous of making a reputation. According to a remark made by Dr. Lee before<br />\nthe debate, the Senior team beat the Juniors<br />\nin experience and speaking ability, but not in<br />\npower of close thought; and it was the latter<br />\ncomplimentary characterization that had given<br />\n1902 some hope of conquering the heroes of<br />\nlast year's conflict. The speeches were mostly<br />\ncomposite, having been \"executed\" by all<br />\nmembers of the teams. As the question stood,<br />\nthe affirmative had a double burden to bear,\u2014<br />\nnot only the burden of the proof, but also the<br />\nburden of four distinct points; and, though it<br />\nwas thought by some that their arguments<br />\nwere superior to those advanced by the negative, but they had too much to prove, otherwise the question was as strong for one side as<br />\nthe other. The decision in justice went to the<br />\nSeniors, who defended the negative of the<br />\nquestion that \"The United States should construct,own,operate and control an inter-oceanic<br />\ncanal by way of the Nicaraguan route.\"<br />\nJ. G. Campbell led for the affirmative. He<br />\narose, somewhat embarassed by the large<br />\ncrowd. He was very effective, and showed<br />\nthe evidences of a natural speaker well trained.<br />\nHe was possibly overtrained, as a conscious<br />\neffort for effect was noticeable, which tended<br />\nto detract attention from the substance of his<br />\nspeech to the delivery. His speech was filled<br />\nwith arguments which he delivered convincingly.<br />\nA. R. Bird, who was the first speaker for<br />\nthe negative, pleased the audience. He has a<br />\nsoft, well-modulated voice, calculated to affect<br />\nthe many maidens in the hall in a tender manner. He brought up in short, sharp sentences<br />\nall the points of the negative; but, owing to the<br />\nfact that he lost the thread of his speech once<br />\nor twice, the continuity of his argument was<br />\nbroken. He gesticulated well, and, on the<br />\nwhole, was interesting, though not the orator<br />\nthat Campbell is.<br />\nHarvey B. Stone followed Bird, and carried<br />\noff the prize for the most effective speaker of<br />\nthe evening. Stone spoke almost altogether<br />\nextemporaneously, but in his flow of hard,<br />\n<br />\nhitting language this was hardly noticed. He<br />\nwas perfectly at ease, and \"got on\" with the<br />\naudience in his very first words. His voice<br />\nwas not good, but his style made up for that<br />\nfailing. He thought quickly, and spoke epigrammaticaliy and naturally, hammering away<br />\nwith all his might at the arguments of the negative. Stone is a convincing speaker.<br />\nJ. A. Riggins came second for the negative<br />\nwith a prepared speech in which he dwelt<br />\nalmost exclusively on the word \"control\" of<br />\nthe question. He was well trained, had a<br />\ngood presence, and brought forward arguments<br />\nwhich must have convinced the judges.<br />\nCharles Markell, Jr., who summed up for<br />\nthe affirmative, was apparently nervous. Having the most difficult position on his side to<br />\ndefend, and one that is not enviable, he did<br />\nwell. His flow of language was good,\u2014in<br />\nfact, too good; for he had the tendency to talk<br />\ntoo much around the point. He gave two or<br />\nthree excellent sentences on the fact that a<br />\nneutral canal was not a possibility, but he<br />\nshould have continued more on this, point.<br />\nConsidering all the difficulties Markell had to<br />\novercome, he was good, but could have been<br />\nbetter.<br />\nJ. G. Machen was the last man of the evening, and was probably the strongest. The<br />\ncalm, cold logic which he, in his sincere, natural manner, poured forth .was convincing.<br />\nHe was at home on the stage, his voice wellsustained, and his manner impressive. He<br />\nspoke so earnestly that one was almost tempted<br />\nto accept what he said, as the best arguments.<br />\nThe result of the debate shows that there is<br />\nplenty of good material at Hopkins for a collegiate team to compete with some of the best<br />\nin this country. There is some possibility of<br />\nengaging certain colleges in debating contests;<br />\nlet us stick by Dr. Lee in his stand that \"it is<br />\nbetter to be licked by a crack team than to<br />\ndefeat a small college,\" and we will have some<br />\nchance of getting in good, appropriate company.<br />\nIn all the speakers the effect of Dr. Lee's<br />\ntraining was evident, so that he has every<br />\nreason to feel satisfied with the night's work.<br />\nThe Senior alternates were: J.

Inter-University debates would bring us<br />\ninto closer relation with the other great unisities of America, and would enable us to make<br />\ncomparisons. Finally, as a business proposition, it would possess inestimable advantages<br />\nin placing Hopkins more prominently before<br />\nthe public eye. This would enable the public<br />\nnot only of Baltimore, but of more remote<br />\nplaces, to pass upon the merits of Hopkins, and<br />\nmight go far towards enabling us to raise the<br />\nnecessary funds for our new home.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nmisapprehension has arisen regarding<br />\nSOME<br />\nan article relating to base ball and last<br />\nyear's base ball team, which appeared in the<br />\nlast issue of the NEWS-LETTER.

He<br />\nhad secured a good schedule and the co-operation of the players was all that was necessary.<br />\nUnfortunately this support was not forthcoming, and, despite his efforts, the men would<br />\nnot work, so consequently the team passed<br />\nout of existence.<br />\nIn justification of Mr. Strouse, we say that<br />\nhad the other ball-players of last year's nine<br />\nbeen as enthusiastic and faithful as he, base<br />\nball at Hopkins would now be a reality instead<br />\nof a sorrowful thing of the past.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nthe Athletic Association in voting me thanks<br />\nfor my work.<br />\n<br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014The present age is remarkable<br />\nELLIOT STROUSE.<br />\nin many ways\u2014some commendable, others March 28th, 1901.<br />\nharmful.

The Juniors<br />\nwere desirous of making a reputation. According to a remark made by Dr. Lee before<br />\nthe debate, the Senior team beat the Juniors<br />\nin experience and speaking ability, but not in<br />\npower of close thought; and it was the latter<br />\ncomplimentary characterization that had given<br />\n1902 some hope of conquering the heroes of<br />\nlast year's conflict. The speeches were mostly<br />\ncomposite, having been \"executed\" by all<br />\nmembers of the teams. As the question stood,<br />\nthe affirmative had a double burden to bear,\u2014<br />\nnot only the burden of the proof, but also the<br />\nburden of four distinct points; and, though it<br />\nwas thought by some that their arguments<br />\nwere superior to those advanced by the negative, but they had too much to prove, otherwise the question was as strong for one side as<br />\nthe other. The decision in justice went to the<br />\nSeniors, who defended the negative of the<br />\nquestion that \"The United States should construct,own,operate and control an inter-oceanic<br />\ncanal by way of the Nicaraguan route.\"<br />\nJ. G. Campbell led for the affirmative. He<br />\narose, somewhat embarassed by the large<br />\ncrowd. He was very effective, and showed<br />\nthe evidences of a natural speaker well trained.<br />\nHe was possibly overtrained, as a conscious<br />\neffort for effect was noticeable, which tended<br />\nto detract attention from the substance of his<br />\nspeech to the delivery. His speech was filled<br />\nwith arguments which he delivered convincingly.<br />\nA. R. Bird, who was the first speaker for<br />\nthe negative, pleased the audience. He has a<br />\nsoft, well-modulated voice, calculated to affect<br />\nthe many maidens in the hall in a tender manner. He brought up in short, sharp sentences<br />\nall the points of the negative; but, owing to the<br />\nfact that he lost the thread of his speech once<br />\nor twice, the continuity of his argument was<br />\nbroken. He gesticulated well, and, on the<br />\nwhole, was interesting, though not the orator<br />\nthat Campbell is.<br />\nHarvey B. Stone followed Bird, and carried<br />\noff the prize for the most effective speaker of<br />\nthe evening. Stone spoke almost altogether<br />\nextemporaneously, but in his flow of hard,<br /><br />\nhitting language this was hardly noticed. He<br />\nwas perfectly at ease, and \"got on\" with the<br />\naudience in his very first words. His voice<br />\nwas not good, but his style made up for that<br />\nfailing. He thought quickly, and spoke epigrammaticaliy and naturally, hammering away<br />\nwith all his might at the arguments of the negative. Stone is a convincing speaker.<br />\nJ. A. Riggins came second for the negative<br />\nwith a prepared speech in which he dwelt<br />\nalmost exclusively on the word \"control\" of<br />\nthe question. He was well trained, had a<br />\ngood presence, and brought forward arguments<br />\nwhich must have convinced the judges.<br />\nCharles Markell, Jr., who summed up for<br />\nthe affirmative, was apparently nervous. Having the most difficult position on his side to<br />\ndefend, and one that is not enviable, he did<br />\nwell. His flow of language was good,\u2014in<br />\nfact, too good; for he had the tendency to talk<br />\ntoo much around the point. He gave two or<br />\nthree excellent sentences on the fact that a<br />\nneutral canal was not a possibility, but he<br />\nshould have continued more on this, point.<br />\nConsidering all the difficulties Markell had to<br />\novercome, he was good, but could have been<br />\nbetter.<br />\nJ. G. Machen was the last man of the evening, and was probably the strongest. The<br />\ncalm, cold logic which he, in his sincere, natural manner, poured forth .was convincing.<br />\nHe was at home on the stage, his voice wellsustained, and his manner impressive. He<br />\nspoke so earnestly that one was almost tempted<br />\nto accept what he said, as the best arguments.<br />\nThe result of the debate shows that there is<br />\nplenty of good material at Hopkins for a collegiate team to compete with some of the best<br />\nin this country. There is some possibility of<br />\nengaging certain colleges in debating contests;<br />\nlet us stick by Dr. Lee in his stand that \"it is<br />\nbetter to be licked by a crack team than to<br />\ndefeat a small college,\" and we will have some<br />\nchance of getting in good, appropriate company.<br />\nIn all the speakers the effect of Dr. Lee's<br />\ntraining was evident, so that he has every<br />\nreason to feel satisfied with the night's work.<br />\nThe Senior alternates were: J.

Undoubtedly the team will suffer<br />\non account of the loss of such men as Maddren<br />\nand McInnes, and the gaps caused by their<br />\ndeparture will be difficult to fill; but, judging<br />\nfrom the earliest work of the team during the<br />\npast two months, it is easy to perceive that<br />\ngood material is not lacking, and that the<br />\npresent lot of new candidates promises to turn<br />\nout some excellent men.<br />\nIt is safe to say that not a single Hopkins<br />\nstudent doubts for a moment the ability of our<br />\nLacrosse Team to maintain the standard set by<br />\nour Lacrosse teams of the past three years.<br />\nIn order to prove this, let those who do not<br />\nplay, remember that they can afford assistance<br />\nand encouragement to the team by coming to<br />\nthe games and \"rooting.\"<br />\nWWW<br /><br />\nHE recent inter-class debate and the standard of excellence attained by the speakers<br />\nof both sides, again re-opens the old question,<br />\n\"Why doesn't Hopkins participate in interuniversity debates ?\" Ranking as she does in<br />\npoint of curriculum and scholastic pre-eminence, our University should certainly be capable of holding her own with any of the \"Big<br />\nFour\" in a debating contest.<br />\nLack of numbers handicaps us to a greater<br />\nor less extent upon the athletic field, but in a<br />\ncase of brain pitted against brain, and muscle,<br />\nfor the time being, left out of the question, the<br />\nodds would not be overwhelmingly against<br />\nus. Inter-University debates would bring us<br />\ninto closer relation with the other great unisities of America, and would enable us to make<br />\ncomparisons. Finally, as a business proposition, it would possess inestimable advantages<br />\nin placing Hopkins more prominently before<br />\nthe public eye. This would enable the public<br />\nnot only of Baltimore, but of more remote<br />\nplaces, to pass upon the merits of Hopkins, and<br />\nmight go far towards enabling us to raise the<br />\nnecessary funds for our new home.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nmisapprehension has arisen regarding<br />\nSOME<br />\nan article relating to base ball and last<br />\nyear's base ball team, which appeared in the<br />\nlast issue of the NEWS-LETTER. It is certainly<br />\ntrue that lack of interest on the part of the<br />\nplayers themselves was alone responsible for<br />\nthe discontinuance of the national game at<br />\nHopkins, but while these gentlemen deserve<br />\nthe censure of the University, the manager of<br />\ntheir team merits no share of the condemnation.

He<br />\nhad secured a good schedule and the co-operation of the players was all that was necessary.<br />\nUnfortunately this support was not forthcoming, and, despite his efforts, the men would<br />\nnot work, so consequently the team passed<br />\nout of existence.<br />\nIn justification of Mr. Strouse, we say that<br />\nhad the other ball-players of last year's nine<br />\nbeen as enthusiastic and faithful as he, base<br />\nball at Hopkins would now be a reality instead<br />\nof a sorrowful thing of the past.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nthe Athletic Association in voting me thanks<br />\nfor my work.<br /><br />\nDEAR SIR:\u2014The present age is remarkable<br />\nELLIOT STROUSE.<br />\nin many ways\u2014some commendable, others March 28th, 1901.<br />\nharmful.
