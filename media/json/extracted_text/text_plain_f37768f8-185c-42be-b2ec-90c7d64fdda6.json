Issues<br />\nthat you are confronted with are<br />\nones that others have not been<br />\nable to resolve, and so they tend<br />\nto be the more complex, knottier<br />\nissues. You're also dealing with<br />\npeople both inside the University and outside the University who<br />\nare themselves seasoned and experienced people and have agendas of their own.<br />\nThe other aspect that's very interesting to me is that it is so<br />\nvaried. As one goes from one<br />\nhour to the next, or one half hour<br />\nto the next, the issues are constantly changing.

What universities try to do<br />\nis more ambitious than what colleges try to do, and it seems to<br />\nme that students have the opportunity to take advantage of that<br />\nmore ambitious agenda, but at the<br />\nsame time, they themselves have<br />\nto be more active learners and<br />\nmore willing to take advantage of<br />\nthe opportunities. So it's a more<br />\nchallenging educational environment, both from a teaching pointof-view but also from a learning<br />\npoint-of-view.<br />\nWhat sorts ofissues do you think<br />\nare important to undergraduates?<br />\nI want to make sure that we've<br />\ngot strong programming and<br />\nstrong co-curricular activities<br />\navailable for students in the<br />\nlonger run. It'll take us a while<br />\n<br />\nto do that, although through some<br />\nof the residence halls and renovation I think we could be constantly improving the quality of space<br />\nand the availability of student<br />\nprograms.<br />\nI don't yet have a good<br />\nunderstanding of the Greek<br />\nsystem at Hopkins, but it plays a<br />\nvery important part in our<br />\nfor<br />\nlife<br />\nUniversity's<br />\nundergraduates. About a third of<br />\nour students are in fraternities or<br />\nsororities, and I think that's an<br />\nimportant part of undergraduate<br />\nlife for a significant number of<br />\nstudents. We want to be sure that<br />\nwe're providing the kind of support which that system typically<br />\nneeds.<br />\nI'd like to make sure that<br />\nundergraduates feel that they have<br />\na voice in the academic life of the<br />\nUniversity. In fact, we've done<br />\nsome things just in the beginning<br />\nof this year to try to get freshmen<br />\nthinking of the way they can be<br />\nparticipating in the life of the<br />\nUniversity. I had a Freshman<br />\nConvocation, for example, the<br />\nfirst week that the freshmen were<br />\nhere,[and told them] that, in addition to the academic life of the<br />\nUniversity, there is so much else<br />\nto be gained from an<br />\nundergraduate education: friend-<br />\n<br />\nships across groups, diverse<br />\ngroups which you might not<br />\nexperience\u2014<br />\notherwise<br />\nparticularly those who come from<br />\nhigh schools that are more<br />\nhomogeneous than Hopkins; taking advantage of opportunities to<br />\nparticipate with the community,<br />\nto give back of our talents to people that are less fortunate of<br />\nwhich there are many; the opportunity to establish experience in<br />\norganization\u2014Orientation, for<br />\nexample, which is a big organizational feat. All these are chances<br />\nfor people to learn and to grow<br />\noutside of the classroom, and I<br />\nthink a university or college has<br />\na responsibility to make sure their<br />\nundergraduates have those kinds<br />\nof experiences.<br />\nEverything happens more<br />\nslowly than I'd like it to happen.<br />\nI like action. But I've recognized over the years that I have to<br />\ntemper that inclination for action<br />\nwith reality. Financially, for example, we can't move as far and<br />\nas fast in the residence halls as I'd<br />\nlike to [but], on the other hand<br />\nwe're undertaking a very major<br />\nseries of steps. We've just finished one [building], we have<br />\nWolman now, and then we'll be<br />\nstarting the third one next summer. So we've got that mapped<br />\n<br />\nout and that's moving ahead in a<br />\nvery effective way, I think. But<br />\nif you asked, \"Hey, would you<br />\nlike to have it all done right<br />\nnow?\" the answer would be<br />\n\"yes.\"<br />\nI would like to see improved<br />\nathletic facilities, particularly a<br />\nnew building, or an addition to<br />\nthe building, and I know, in due<br />\ncourse, we'll do that. I certainly<br />\nintend, as one of my priorities, to<br />\nbe working on the feasibility for<br />\na Homewood fundraising campaign. And if we could incorporate that in, and it's feasible to<br />\nincorporate that in, I'd like to,<br />\nbecause I think that's something<br />\nthat we need.<br />\nI think our residence hall<br />\nsystem, and the approach that<br />\nwehave of advisors in the<br />\nresidence halls (Housemasters<br />\nand so on), from what I can<br />\nunderstand, seems to be a very<br />\nwell-received and very effective<br />\nsystem. We had a system like that<br />\nat Trinity College, where I was<br />\none, and it was something that I<br />\ngot a lot out of and I think was<br />\ngood for the other students. And,<br />\nof course, we have a range of<br />\nresidence halls, too. If you can<br />\ncontrast Rogers on the one hand<br />\nto some of the very large<br />\nresidence halls on the other, it's<br />\na challenge to go from one to the<br />\nother. But the intimacy of Rogers<br />\nand the effectiveness that the<br />\nHousemaster of Rogers can have<br />\non that rather small, and, I guess,<br />\nhigh-morale, almost family like<br />\ngroup of students is something we<br />\nought to try to replicate in almost<br />\nall that we do.<br />\nI came from a very big university. We had a total of 70,000<br />\nstudents at Penn State, and at the<br />\nUniversity Park campus, we had<br />\n29,000. They almost never felt<br />\nlike they were a part of a big<br />\nuniversity, except when they<br />\nwanted to. It was a place that had<br />\nan intimate feel to it because there<br />\nwere lots and lots of groups, lots<br />\nand lots of sub-arrangements for<br />\nhousing, through the Greek<br />\nsystem, and through the offcampus apartment housing that<br />\nwas available to students as well<br />\nas our on-campus housing.<br />\n(There were about 13,000.) But<br />\npeople had the sense of a small<br />\nplace because they were able to<br />\nwork in smaller groups and clubs.<br />\nHow is this approach different<br />\nfrom the \"corporate\"approach?<br />\nI think that over the years<br />\nHopkins will evolve. I don't<br />\nknow what it would be at this<br />\npoint, but I think Hopkins will<br />\nevolve a modified way of looking at the way in which it accounts for its resources. It seems<br />\nto me as we move on, we're going to have to grow and develop<br />\nnew approaches and new<br />\nunderstandings that both take into account the differences in costs<br />\nand style of various places and the<br />\nopportunities for garnering<br />\nresources from outside the<br />\nUniversity. Some areas are better able to do that than others\u2014<br />\nsome are able to do that from<br />\ngrant/contract sources, for example, while others might be better<br />\nable to do that from philanthropic<br />\nsources. I think we need to<br />\nrecognize those differences and<br />\ntake advantage of them where we<br />\nsee them.<br />\nWe also need to have a University that is greater than the sum<br />\nof its parts. The idea that Hopkins<br />\nis simply a co-activity of separate<br />\nschools or divisions is not appealing to me because this is a university, and we need all to be contributing to the broader university role in our society and beyond,<br />\nand I think each division has its<br />\npart to play.<br />\n<br />\nGoodFellas<br />\nA MARTIN SCORSESE PICTURE<br />\n<br />\nNThree Decades of Life in the Mafia.<br />\n<br />\nHow would you deal with changing the existing structure?<br />\n<br />\nMINER BOOS.<br />\nMARTIN SCOIIS[SE [ion GOONMAS ROBERT DE NIf10 \u2022 HAY HOTTA \u2022 JOE PESCI<br />\n11,11101IN WINKLED<br />\nLORRAINE BRACCO PAR SOD VINO 'Fixrec dutliget BARBARA DE FINA \"sel:Vb1 NICHOLAS MEG'<br />\n\"rm't NICHO[AS PIIIGGI & MARTIN SCORSESE PIodunlRffN WINKLER<br />\nIlev\u00b0 MARTIN SCORSESE<br />\nP<br />\n<br />\nWARNER BROS.<br />\n<br />\nUNOEN IT MOINES ACCOMPANYING<br />\nPARENT DI ADULT GUARDIAN<br />\n<br />\n[SOiniacIhuranilao1Ic<br />\n<br />\nRecords faiiites and CDs]<br />\n<br />\n7MPANV<br />\nA TIME WARNEP<br />\nt orteI,.PLIble Rrovr.11<br />\n<br />\nSTARTS FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 21st<br />\n<br />\nThe process is very important.<br />\nWe have to make sure that the<br />\nfaculties and the students and the<br />\nleadership of the divisions participate in an examination of the<br />\nway we're doing things now and<br />\nreview options of the way in<br />\nwhich we might do things in the<br />\nfuture.

In addition to that, there is<br />\nsomething known as the President's Advisory and Policy Committee, which [comprises] the<br />\nVice Presidents and the general<br />\ncouncil. I meet with each of these<br />\ngroups once a month. The groups<br />\nwill all have a role in discussing<br />\nthe formulation of whatever<br />\ndirections or options that we<br />\ndevelop and are available to us.<br />\nIn addition, there will be an<br />\ninter-divisional faculty group with<br />\ntwo representatives from each of<br />\nthe schools, and that group I will<br />\nuse as a sounding board for any<br />\nideas that I come up with. Beyond<br />\nthat, there are the councils and<br />\nacademic boards within the divisions, and, of course, the student<br />\ngovernments and student<br />\nrepresentation.<br />\nSo there is a whole variety of<br />\ngroups and forums which can be<br />\nused for feedback, ideas and so<br />\non.

I would hope that we<br />\ncan develop a more systematic<br />\nkind of advisory structure that<br />\nwill be effective and stable and<br />\nwon't require us to do ad hoc<br />\nthings as much.<br />\nDo you think student input is important in planning aspects ofthe<br />\nUniversity's future?<br />\nAbsolutely. I gave Bob Nelson<br />\na gavel at the Freshman Convocation as a symbol of the importance that I've placed on the involvement of the students in providing advice, and we'll take that<br />\nback at Commencement and pass<br />\nit on to next year's president.<br />\nIs the amount of student input<br />\nlikely to make it as far as .the<br />\nAcademic Council?<br />\nI don't know how that will<br />\nwork. Of course, that's a matter<br />\nfor the deans of the Homewood<br />\nSchool Services and the academic<br />\ndeans more than the president.<br />\nHopkins<br />\nIs<br />\nacademically?<br />\n<br />\nsuffering<br />\n<br />\nI think Hopkins is doing amazingly well. One of the biggest surprises to me, when I came to<br />\nHopkins, was how the degree to<br />\nwhich Hopkins itself, and the way<br />\nin which it portrayed itself, had<br />\nreflected a situation that was<br />\nperceived as negative, when, in<br />\nfact, Hopkins is very, very<br />\nstrong.lt really is a very strong<br />\nuniversity. There's a tendency to<br />\ndo two or three things. One is to<br />\ncompare Hopkins today with<br />\nwhat Hopkins was 15 or 20 years<br />\nago, and, in the course of that, to<br />\n<br />\nnot look at what has happened to<br />\nArts and Sciences colleges<br />\neverywhere and the effects of the<br />\neconomics of the last 15 years on<br />\ngraduate education as well as<br />\nundergraduate education.<br />\nHopkins was starting from a<br />\nvery, very selective high ground<br />\nin terms of almost any measure<br />\nthat you could want, and it continues to be in that same relative<br />\nposition compared to many other<br />\ncolleges and universities. It did<br />\nget out ahead of some of the<br />\nothers in terms of cost measures.<br />\nFor example, in the past two<br />\nyears, a number of other universities have run into the same sorts<br />\nof problems that Hopkins has run<br />\ninto a couple of years ago.<br />\nBecause of our budgeting system,<br />\nwe found it very early and identified it as a problem before it<br />\ncaused any serious complications.<br />\nSo, with that considered, I would<br />\nsay that Hopkins is doing extremely well.<br />\nDo you think that there is a problem with thefaculty/student ratio<br />\nas it currently stands?<br />\n-I haven't yet had enough exposure to get a sense of where the<br />\nstresses are and where they<br />\naren't. If you look at it overall,<br />\nwe're all right. I think that if you<br />\nlook at it group by group, division by division, Or even<br />\ndiscipline by discipline then my<br />\nguess is that there are some<br />\ndisciplines which need additional<br />\nfaculty and others that could get<br />\nalong with what they have.<br />\nIn light ofthe problemsfacing the<br />\nundergraduate program at<br />\nHopkins (e.g. budget problems,<br />\ndecreased enrollment, class<br />\navailability and sizes, etc.), how<br />\ndo you plan to uphold the standards of Hopkins education?<br />\nWe're going to establish what<br />\nthe standard is that we think is<br />\nmost compatible with the nature<br />\nof the University, the arrangements which we have in<br />\nrespect to graduate and<br />\nundergraduate education, and the<br />\ntype of faculty that we have. That<br />\nwill be done through discussion<br />\nin the Homewood Academic<br />\nCouncil. We'll do it through an<br />\nacademic planning process, a lot<br />\nof which has already been accomplished (for example, in the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences<br />\nthrough the leadership of Dean<br />\nArmstrong), and we'll arrive at<br />\nwhat we consider to be, from an<br />\nacademic point-of-view, the appropriate balance, with respect to,<br />\nfor example, numbers of faculty<br />\nin Arts and Sciences. That has to<br />\nbo on during the course of this<br />\nyear, and I want to have that process informed by academic considerations and not simply<br />\nbudgetary considerations...<br />\nAs far as the quality of the incoming freshman class, it's the<br />\nsame as the quality of last year's<br />\nand, in fact, is a few students<br />\nlarger. [It's true that] there is a<br />\ndecreasing pool of high school<br />\ngraduates, but it hasn't affected<br />\nHopkins yet. I have no way of<br />\njudging what the effect will be [in<br />\nthe future'. So far, the selective<br />\nuniversities and colleges have not<br />\nfound it to be a problem.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nHILLCREST CLINIC<br />\n<br />\nTAKE A LIBRARY<br />\nTOUR!!<br />\n<br />\nPrompt confidential help<br />\n\u2022 FREE PREGNANCY TESTING<br />\n\u2022 ABORTION SERVICES<br />\n\u2022 BIRTH CONTROL SERVICES<br />\nFOR APPOINTMENTS CALL:<br />\n<br />\n1 788-44001<br />\n'll \u2022<br />\n<br />\npw<br />\n<br />\n\u2022SONOGRAMS<br />\n\u2022 COUNSELING .<br />\n\u2022 COMMUNITY EDUCATION<br />\n<br />\nOpen Mon Sat<br />\n8 30 51.!Opm<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\nSEM,<br />\n.i dia<br />\nim<br />\n5.4 !<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n5602 Baltimore National Pike *600<br />\n<br />\n--<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n. 0<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nThe Milton S.

It always seemed odd<br />\nto try to reserve a seat in class,<br />\nlike it were some concert that you<br />\nwanted the best possible seat for.<br />\nBut, every day, Zack told her,<br />\n\"Save me a seat,\" so she did.<br />\nThis way she could be sure that<br />\nZack sat close enough to the front<br />\nthat he couldn't help but pay attention. And then, if he did find<br />\na way, she could always kick him<br />\nsurreptitiously.<br />\nShe pulled the attached desk<br />\naround the arm of the chair and<br />\nset her notebook on it. It barely<br />\nfit. Whoever designed these attachable desks for auditoriums<br />\ndidn't have function as a high<br />\npriority. Not even a low priority. A person had to be a<br />\ncontortionist to write in one, let<br />\nalone at the speed to take notes<br />\nThe desk (or facsimile thereof)<br />\nnext to her slammed down. It was<br />\nZack.<br />\n\"What'd you get?\" Miranda<br />\nasked.<br />\n\"Mmrnm,\" muttered Zack, a<br />\nhum that Miranda had learned to<br />\ntranslate as \"a Mounds bar and<br />\na Coke. Now let me sleep.\"<br />\nZack slid down in his chair<br />\nabout as far as his back would<br />\nallow without breaking, opened<br />\nhis notebook, and scribbled<br />\n\"Psychology Notes-11/15\" effortlessly at the top of the page.<br />\nObviously that was the secret of<br />\nthe desks of doom: one had to be<br />\nhalf-asleep and mostly horizontal.<br />\nMiranda heard Professor<br />\nMulvihill before she saw her. The<br />\n\"tak-tak-tak\" of the teacher's red<br />\nhigh heels always preceded her<br />\nactual appearance. Miranda opened her notebook to start some<br />\nnotes, but instead found an unfinished letter to David. Oh joy.<br />\nMiranda had been going out<br />\nwith David for three years. Unfortunately, she'd only been at<br />\nschool for two and a half, meaning David was still at home in San<br />\nDiego. Unfortunately, this meant<br />\nthat Miranda only got to see him<br />\nthree months out of the year. On<br />\nthe other hand, though, it gave<br />\nher a fine excuse to be as<br />\nantisocial as she wanted. Aside<br />\nfrom her roommates, Daris ond<br />\nCarol, the only real friend she<br />\nspent much time with was. . .<br />\nsnoring in the chair next to her.<br />\n\"Zack!\" she whispered. Zack<br />\n<br />\nstarted and looked at her. So did<br />\nProfessor Mulvihill. Miranda sat<br />\nmeekly as the glare passed over<br />\nher. Miranda went back to her<br />\nnotes. Professor Mulvihill went<br />\nback to speaking about Carol<br />\nGilligan. Zack went back to<br />\nsleep.<br />\nThe next half hour went by as<br />\nit usually did in Psychology class.<br />\nMiranda desperately scribbled illegible scrawls in her notebook<br />\ntrying not to miss a word of the<br />\nlecture, all the while nudging<br />\nZack any time his body fell below<br />\n<br />\n'Whoever designed<br />\nthese desks<br />\ndidn't have<br />\nfunction as a<br />\nhigh priority...<br />\na forty-five degree angle. About<br />\nhalfway through class he finally<br />\nnoticed that he was awake and<br />\nasked Miranda what was going<br />\non.<br />\nMiranda had anticipated this,<br />\nand answered him, \"She's talking about Carol Gilligan.\" This<br />\nwould answer Zack's question<br />\nwhile still leaving him completely<br />\nin the dark about what was going<br />\non. Miranda smiled a bit. If the<br />\nboy wasn't going to pay attention<br />\n<br />\nNot even a low priority.<br />\nto class, well.<br />\n\"Yo, Miranda,\" whispered<br />\nZack. Miranda looked over and<br />\nalready Zack's notebook was<br />\ncovered with some strange doodle of people and grass huts.<br />\n\"What's that?\" Miranda asked, taking the bait.<br />\n\"Look,\" Zack said.<br />\nMiranda looked. The caption<br />\nbelow the picture read, \"Carol<br />\nGilligan's Island.\" The large person blob was saying to a small<br />\nperson blob in a dress,\"So little<br />\nbuddy, how about a nightcap?\"<br />\nThe smaller blob replied, \"Now,<br />\nSkipper, you know that as a<br />\ngender, we find remarks like that<br />\ndemeaning.\" Miranda found the<br />\nidea of Carol Gilligan walking<br />\naround in a red shirt and white hat<br />\nall the taime a thought so deranged<br />\nthat it could only come from Zack.<br />\n. . which is Carol Gilligan's<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\nLoss of Stellar French Department<br />\nIllustrates Unique Problems<br />\nMany of the undergraduate students who pass<br />\nthrough the halls of Johns Hopkins, particularly<br />\nthose who study the sciences, are probably unaware<br />\nof the high-powered academics available to them<br />\nin some of the humanities departments. In general,<br />\nundergraduates tend to tow the superficial university line: Hopkins is a school for scientists,<br />\nespecially pre-medical students.<br />\n<br />\nAchieving the strength and prestige the French<br />\ndepartment had achieved with its limited faculty<br />\nsize required a delicate balance of faculty members'<br />\ntalents and areas of interest. And it goes without<br />\nsaying that each faculty member had to be strong<br />\nindividually. The department had to simulate<br />\nphysical depth and breadth through a carefully<br />\nplanned and managed collection of unique, exceptional scholars.<br />\n<br />\nStudents studying the humanities may come to<br />\nHopkins a little better informed about the opportunities available in other areas. All certainly gain<br />\nan understanding of the import of Hopkins' small,<br />\ndiverse, and prestigious humanities faculty as they<br />\nprogress through their academic program here.<br />\n<br />\nThus, when over half the department left, the<br />\nUniversity lost much more than a few professors,<br />\nand experienced much more than a temporary setback in a marginal department. The loss to the<br />\nUniversity is nonrecoverable, and starting from<br />\nscratch means building something totally new.<br />\nRebuilding takes time, talent, and effort\u2014and a<br />\nstrong upper-level administrative commitment.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, such academic standouts as the<br />\nDepartment of French go largely unrecognized here<br />\nat Hopkins. Even an undergraduate who decides<br />\nto major in French may not realize the stature of<br />\nthe scholars teaching her classes. Her peers certainly do not understand that while they may be<br />\nat the number one pre-medical institution in the<br />\nUnited States, she too is a part\u2014and a bigger part,<br />\nproportionately\u2014of one of the top departments in<br />\nthe country in her field.<br />\nAll of this to bring into focus the loss Hopkins<br />\nexperienced when over half of the French department left for Emory University last spring. Despite<br />\nHopkins' small size and supposedly favored commitment to sciences, the French department was<br />\none of the top three in the country. This is astounding when one considers the size of and resources<br />\navailable to those universities with departments<br />\nranked well below those of Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nFaculty moves like the ones made by Josef Harari<br />\nand his colleagues last spring are not all that exceptional. But, as is often the case here, the<br />\nqualities which makes Hopkins a singular institution also leave the University uniquely vulnerable.<br />\nThe delicate balance that allowed Hopkins to surpass its peers crumbled quickly and irretrievably;<br />\nthe damage is felt more acutely and overcome less<br />\neasily than would be the case elsewhere.<br />\nThe French department as its former self was<br />\nnot an anomaly. Rather, its uniquely structured<br />\nacademic strength is exemplary of several other<br />\ndepartments at Hopkins, as well as at the University as a whole. Like the French department, these<br />\nother areas are uniquely vulnerable. How much<br />\nmore of this type of damage can the University suffer without losing its grip on the delicate balance<br />\nthat allows it to achieve its level of excellence?<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Black and Blue Jay Gets Submissive; A Racist Slur<br />\nRecalled from Spring Fair; Fishing for 'The Right Angle'<br />\nDear JHU Community:<br />\n<br />\nhas the right to deface any other<br />\ngroup's posters.

The present policy of the Department of<br />\nDefense that \"Homosexuals are<br />\nunsuitable for military service and<br />\nare not permitted to serve in the<br />\nArmed Forces in any capacity,\"<br />\nwhich applies also to the ROTC<br />\nprogram, seems an obvious contradiction to Johns Hopkins' written commitment to preventing<br />\ndiscrimination against gays and<br />\nlesbians.<br />\nSome may counter that the<br />\nclause stating \"any student program administered by the University\" frees Hopkins from any<br />\nresponsibility in dealing with the<br />\nissue since it does not \"administer\" military policy. How<br />\nthen does Hopkins not administer<br />\nthe transfer of credits students<br />\nenrolled in ROTC receive into<br />\nUniversity credits? Does it not<br />\nadminister the faculty status of<br />\n<br />\nROTC instructors? Does Hopkins<br />\nnot maintain the training facilities<br />\non campus? Does it not at least<br />\nhelp to dispense information<br />\nabout ROTC programs to prospective students including the<br />\nNews-Letter (see page 5 of last<br />\nweek's edition)? Those who feel<br />\nthe University does not take an<br />\nactive role in administering<br />\nROTC activities at Hopkins are<br />\nclearly mistaken.<br />\nThe fact that the present<br />\nmilitary policies regarding gays<br />\nand lesbians are baseless does not<br />\nseem to matter to policy makers<br />\nin the Deparment of Defense or<br />\nthe administration of the University. On September 2, 1990, the<br />\nNew York Times published an article which began \"The commander of the Navy's surface<br />\nAtlantic fleet has characterized<br />\nlesbian sailors as 'among the<br />\ncommand's top performers' but<br />\ntold his officers that homosexual<br />\nwomen must be vigorously rooted<br />\nout of service.\" The military continues to forcibly discharge about<br />\n1,400 gays and lesbians each<br />\nyear, with lesbians dicharged at<br />\nthree times the rate of gay men.<br />\nThe article also refers to<br />\nRepresentative Gerry E. Studd's<br />\ndisclosure last year of two studies<br />\nconducted by the Pentagon which<br />\n\"found no evidence that homsexuals disrupted the armed forces,<br />\nPaul DelGrosso is president of<br />\npraised their performance, and<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Gay and Les- urged<br />\ntheir retention.\" These<br />\nbian Alliance.<br />\n<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nContinued from page 6<br />\nprime contribution to Psychology<br />\nToday.\" The voice of Professor<br />\nMulvihill making An Important<br />\nPoint distracted Miranda from<br />\nZack's reverie.<br />\n\"What did she say?\" Miranda<br />\nasked Zack. \"what was the main<br />\npoint?\"<br />\n\"Huh? Oh, I don't know. I<br />\nwasn't listening.\"<br />\nThere was some sort of commotion in the classroom, and as<br />\nMiranda turned to ask the person<br />\non the left, she found that there<br />\nwas no one there. In fact, most<br />\neveryone was leaving.<br />\nClass was over. Miranda spun<br />\nabout, desperately looking for someone who knew what Carol<br />\n<br />\nGilligan's prime contribution to<br />\npsychology today was. The rest<br />\nof the class was pouring out<br />\nthrough the doors in the back of<br />\nthe auditorium. She tried to get<br />\nup and discovered the other thing<br />\nshe hated about the desks from<br />\nhell. She couldn't get out of them.<br />\n\"Zack,\" she asked, \"could<br />\nyou give me a hand with my<br />\nseat?\"<br />\nNext: Lunch with Miranda proves<br />\nto be a cross between As The<br />\nWorld Turns and Revenge ofthe<br />\nBlob.

In a December 24, 1941,<br />\nmemorandum outlining the basis<br />\nof the military's exclusion of<br />\nblacks, the armed services explain: \"The close and intimate<br />\nconditions of life aboard ship, the<br />\nnecessity for the highest possible<br />\ndegree of unity and esprit-decorps, the requirement of<br />\nmorale\u2014all these demand that<br />\nnothing be done which may<br />\nadversely affect the situation. Past<br />\nexperiences have shown irrefutably that the enlistment of<br />\nNegroes (other than for mess attendants) leads to disruptive and<br />\nundermining conditions.\" Compare this with the present<br />\nmilitary's stance against gays and<br />\n<br />\nlesbians. \"Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.<br />\nThe presence of such members<br />\nadversely affects the ability of the<br />\nArmed Forces to maintain<br />\ndiscipline, good order, and<br />\nmorale; to foster mutual trust and<br />\nconfidence among the members;<br />\nto ensure the integrity of the<br />\nsystem of rank and command; to<br />\nfacilitate assignment and<br />\nworldwide deployment of<br />\nmembers who frequently must<br />\n<br />\nAs long as ROTC<br />\noperates under a<br />\ndiscriminatory policy,<br />\nHopkins should<br />\n'Just say no'<br />\nlive and work under close conditions affording minimal privacy;<br />\nto recruit and retain members of<br />\nthe military services; to maintain<br />\nthe public acceptability of<br />\nmilitary services; and, in certain<br />\ncircumstances, to prevent<br />\nbreaches of security.\" The<br />\nmilitary continues to prove time<br />\nand time again that the only real<br />\nproblem with mofdle is among<br />\nthose who appeal to emotion<br />\nContinued on page 8<br />\n<br />\nand he becomes testy at any statement from the press which insinuates that he does.<br />\nSouter has been quite evasive<br />\nabout the question himself.<br />\nRepeatedly in the confirmation<br />\nhearings, Democratic Senators<br />\nhave attempted to nail him down<br />\nto a specific position. Repeatedly Souter has adroitly sidestepped<br />\nthe question by refusing to reveal<br />\n<br />\nSouter has remained<br />\ntight-lipped<br />\nabout abortion<br />\neither his personal or legal position on Roe v. Wade.<br />\nThis refusal to let his feelings<br />\nbe known about abortion have led<br />\nsome pro-choice groups to insist<br />\nthat Souter is unfit to serve on the<br />\nSupreme Court. Never mind that<br />\nhe possesses an excellent educational and legal background and<br />\nthat most who have come into<br />\ncontact with him firmly believe<br />\nthat he will be a capable justice.<br />\nBut such minor details haven't<br />\nprevented these groups from<br />\nderailing talented nominees in the<br />\npast.<br />\nRemember the rhetorical war<br />\nthat prevented Robert Bork from<br />\nbecoming a justice in 1987? Bork<br />\nbegan confirmation hearings acclaimed as one of the most<br />\ntalented nominees in many years.<br />\nYet Bork had made the mistake<br />\nof leaving an extensive \"paper<br />\ntrail,\" allowing posturing<br />\nmembers of the Judiciary Committee to have political (not legal)<br />\nreasons to attack him. The conservative legal philosophy that he<br />\nhad spelled out in writing provided the ammunition for his foes to<br />\nmount a media campaign, which<br />\nBork had no chance to overcome.<br />\nEventually, that campaign led<br />\nto the nomination of Anthony<br />\nKennedy to the Supreme Court.<br />\nSupposedly more moderate than<br />\nBork, Kennedy has proven to be<br />\na much more consistent conservative voice than many believe<br />\nBork would have been.

The<br />\nascension of David Souter to the<br />\nSupreme Court, as Yard claimed before the Senate Judiciary<br />\nCommittee on Tuesday, would<br />\nmean \"ending freedom for<br />\nwomen in this country.\"<br />\nBut sometime within the next<br />\nmonth, the U.S. Senate will, in<br />\nall likelihood, vote to confirm<br />\nSouter to the highest court in the<br />\nland. Yet in the wake of the continuing Iraq-Kuwait showdown,<br />\nand due to the lack of much in the<br />\nway of real controversy, the<br />\nSouter confirmation hearings<br />\ndrew relatively scant press<br />\ncoverage.<br />\nTo his advantage, Souter has<br />\nbeen able to keep a much lower<br />\nprofile than recent nominees to<br />\nthe Court. As has been well<br />\ndocumented, the New Hampshire<br />\njudge has masterfully prevented<br />\npotential adversaries from learning much about his views on important issues, chiefly by failing<br />\nto leave behind the sort of\"paper<br />\ntrail\" that can reveal a judge's<br />\nproclivities on politically sensitive<br />\nissues.<br />\nFor the most part, the only<br />\nquestions which come directly<br />\nfrom Souter's past stem from his<br />\nactivities as New Hampshire State<br />\nAttorney General. The most controversial issue in which he was<br />\ninvolved concerned an affirmative action case. Souter fought<br />\nfederal regulations that require<br />\nNew Hampshire to provide information about the racial composition of its work force. Some civil<br />\nrights groups, including the<br />\nMexican-American<br />\nLegal<br />\nDefense Fund, have announced<br />\ntheir opposition to Souter for such<br />\nprevious actions.<br />\nWhat is conspicuously absent<br />\nfrom Souter's past, interestingly, is any opinion on the most<br />\ndecisive issue in today's society.<br />\nAt this point, no one claims to<br />\nknow exactly where David Souter<br />\nstands on abortion.

The article spoke of a feeling that \"Something is wrong in<br />\nthe academy, or at least that part<br />\nof it that is supposed to educate<br />\nundergraduates.\"<br />\nAs a Hopkins undergraduate,<br />\nthis article concerned me deeply.<br />\nLater I read a copy of President<br />\nRichardson's convocation address<br />\nto see if he mentioned the greater<br />\npurpose of undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins. My purpose was to see<br />\nif he acknowledged, unlike his<br />\npredecessor, the problems with<br />\nundergraduate education. His<br />\nspeech, less eloquent on paper<br />\nthan in person, said that Hopkins,<br />\n\"reserves its greatest rewards for<br />\nthe tenacious, the persistant, and<br />\nthe assertive.\"<br />\nThat line, at face value, appears to make sense. After all,<br />\nHopkins did not introduce<br />\n<br />\nmodern undergraduate education<br />\nto this country, it introduced<br />\ngraduate education. But upon further reflection, Richardson's<br />\nstatement does not make sense.<br />\nLast spring, President Bush spoke<br />\non campus to honor Johns<br />\nHopkins' role in medicine. Outside Shriver Hall were protesters<br />\nnoting the irony in giving Bush<br />\nan honorary degree while his<br />\nbudget proposed slashing funding<br />\nfor medical research.<br />\nIt seems to me that President<br />\nRichardson is doing the same<br />\nthing. While speaking of student<br />\ninitiative, he is steadily decreasing the opportunities for<br />\nundergaduates to receive a<br />\n\"Hopkins\" undergraduate education. There was a time when introductory Biology had a required<br />\nlab. Today a freshman must try<br />\nand find some kind of independent research if he wants any type<br />\nof laboratory experience.<br />\nThe<br />\nparallels<br />\nbetween<br />\nPresidents Richardson and Bush<br />\n<br />\nare so similar that they're eerie.<br />\nBoth have produced solid, if not<br />\nstandard backrounds. It would be<br />\na close race to see who could<br />\nscamper away from controversy<br />\nfirst. Both appear to be in control<br />\nbut events seem to slip away from<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe article closed stating<br />\nthat many schools are trying to evaluate their approaches<br />\nto undergraduate education.

Even before its<br />\nopening tonight in Baltimore,<br />\nGoodFellas is being debated on<br />\nthe evening news. One ItalianAmerican representative has said<br />\nit is the worst thing to happen to<br />\nItalians in this country in years.<br />\nSo far, Scorsese himself has not<br />\nspoken, choosing to allow the<br />\nfilm to speak for itself.<br />\nThe story of GoodFellas<br />\nrevolves around a group of<br />\nMafiosos, or \"wiseguys,\" in a<br />\ntight-knit Italian community.<br />\nHenry (Ray Liotta) is a young and<br />\nambitious Irish-Italian mobster,<br />\nwho narrates over flashbacks<br />\nabout how, at age 13, he got a job<br />\nwith the cab company across the<br />\n<br />\nstreet, run by well-known Mafia<br />\nmen. He begins making<br />\ndeliveries, then selling stolen<br />\ncigarette shipments, then blowing<br />\nup cars. His coming-of-age takes<br />\nplace in a court-room lobby,<br />\nwhen his bosses hug him for<br />\nsliding out of his first arrest. \"It<br />\nwas,\" as Henry says, \"a glorious<br />\ntime.\"<br />\nHenry collaborates with Jimmy<br />\n(Robert DeNiro), a seasoned<br />\nthief, hijacker and hitman, and<br />\nthe two plan half-million dollar<br />\nheists in thirty-second chats over<br />\ndrinks. Henry is seduced by the<br />\nglamour and power of his new<br />\nposition.

While the crime comes off<br />\nwithout a hitch (at least at first),<br />\nthe community itself begins to<br />\ncave in under the weight of its<br />\nown contradictions.<br />\nGoodFellas is not notable for<br />\nits plot. Scorsese has never been<br />\nknown as a storyteller, and like<br />\n<br />\nmost of his films, the narration in<br />\nGoodFellas is loose at best. What<br />\nis most intriguing about the film<br />\nis its portrayal of an odd and<br />\nrarely-seen community, a warm<br />\nand affectionate family of men<br />\nwho, for reasons known only to<br />\nthem, kill each other from time<br />\nto time.<br />\nAs in Coppola's Godfather<br />\nfilms, the focus here is on the<br />\nways in which personal attachments to family and friends<br />\nintrude on the business of killing<br />\nand vice versa. Throughout the<br />\nfilm, Scorsese shows us an odd<br />\nand volatile mixture of warmth<br />\nand anger, of violence and<br />\ncultural tradition. In one scene,<br />\nTommy has a barroom audience<br />\nroaring with laughter\u2014until the<br />\nproprietor asks him to pay his<br />\nbill, when he slams a bottle over<br />\nthe man's head.

Some<br />\nof them are hilariously funny,<br />\nothers incomprehensibly weird,<br />\nwhile still others are touchig and<br />\nmeaningful.<br />\nOn the fun side, there is<br />\n\"Kakania\" (USA), the hip and<br />\nhypnotizing dance of modern urban chaos set against a rhythmic<br />\norder of tribal cultures.

And most impressively, in \"Balance\" (Germany), five lone figures stand<br />\nbalanced on a tilted platform in<br />\nempty space, their survival<br />\ndependent on the movement of<br />\nthe others. It leaves an eerie and<br />\npowerful statement behind, and<br />\none that should keep you thinking for a long time.<br />\nThere are also some relatively<br />\nweak entries. \"Cat and Rat\"<br />\n(USA) is a cross-dimensional<br />\nmeta-cartoon with a simplistic<br />\nTom and Jerry storyline. \"Warm<br />\nReception in LA\"(USA) is just<br />\nbland and cute at best, both artistically and thematically. And<br />\nworst of all was \"Shadrach\"<br />\n(USA), an animated homage to,<br />\nof all the socially helpful, The<br />\nBeastie Boys.<br />\nThose aside, the Tournee of<br />\nAnimation is a treat for the<br />\nsenses, a discount pass to over a<br />\ndozen bizarre universes of the imagination. Most of it is really funny. Some of it can teach you<br />\nthings, and all of it is stunning to<br />\nwatch. So you should all pull<br />\nyourselves away from the tube<br />\nthis weekend and go.

The room was in fact the<br />\noriginal theater used by the<br />\nJusuits, and remnants of the<br />\nbackdrop painting can still be<br />\nseen on the brick walls.<br />\nOne of the most innovative<br />\nideas behind this project is the<br />\n<br />\nconcept of flexible seating<br />\ntowers. Among possible configurations are the arena theater<br />\nor theater in the round, as well\u2022<br />\nas proscenium theater.

They are a part of<br />\na campus wide recycling program<br />\ninitiated by the Students for Environmental Action, in a joint effort with Plant Operations. In effect since last semester, the program represents the efforts of<br />\nSEA after only one year on campus as a student group. The group<br />\ntakes recyclable trash to recycling centers in the interest of a<br />\n<br />\ncleaner and safer environment.<br />\nSpecially-labelled containers<br />\nfor aluminum cans, glass, tin, and<br />\nwhite paper have been placed in<br />\nvirtually every building on campus. (There are plans to place<br />\ncontainers in off-campus living<br />\nfacilities in the near future.) In an<br />\nagreement between the school<br />\nand SEA,the school pays for the<br />\ncost of the containers.<br />\nJanitors empty all recyclable<br />\ntrash into several central locations. The SEA then picks up all<br />\nof the recyclable trash from<br />\n<br />\nvarious \"pickup points\" agreed<br />\nupon with custodial services and<br />\ntakes the trash to a 1000 pound<br />\ncapacity trailer, donated by Alcoa<br />\nAluminum Company. From the<br />\ntrailer on campus, SEA takes the<br />\nrecyclable trash to the appropriate<br />\nrecycling centers. White paper<br />\nand glass bottles are taken to<br />\nModern Junk and Salvage, while<br />\naluminum cans are sold to Alcoa<br />\nAluminum.<br />\nApproximately 230 pounds of<br />\naluminum and 1000 pounds of<br />\nglass are recycled each week. According to SEA President David<br />\nPyles, twenty percent of the<br />\nuniversity's waste is being recycled. The SEA's goal is to recycle<br />\n50 percent of the school's waste.<br />\nIf this were accomplished, the<br />\nschool would save between ten<br />\nand fifteen thousand dollars on<br />\ndisposal fees. Currently, all the<br />\nmoney received from the various<br />\n<br />\nApproximately<br />\n230 pounds of<br />\naluminum and 1000<br />\npounds of glass<br />\nare recycled<br />\neach week<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\nrecycling centers goes toward the<br />\ncustodial services budget.<br />\nEd Warns, Director of Plant<br />\nOperations, noted that it costs 40<br />\ndollars a ton\u2022to remove garbage<br />\nthrough,a commercial waste company. Therefore, by recycling,<br />\nthe school not only receives<br />\nmoney for recyclables, but saves<br />\non waste disposal as well.<br />\n<br />\nBiendan Kruk<br />\n<br />\nRing<br />\n<br />\nThe SEA is working on a program to recycle plastics.

Not only would storage<br />\nspace be a problem, but it would<br />\ncost around 120 dollars per load<br />\nfor removal.<br />\nWarns expressed a positive<br />\nreaction to the program coordinated with SEA: \"Overall, we<br />\nhave had good cooperation from<br />\nboth the students and the<br />\nemployees.\" He went on to note<br />\nthat there has been only one<br />\ncomplaint\u2014from a person who<br />\nfelt the open soda cans were attracting bees.

Pyles added: \"Our goal is<br />\nto educate people to stop using<br />\ndisposable items such as paper<br />\ncups and instead use washable<br />\ndishes.\"<br />\nFor all those interested in<br />\nbecoming involved in SEA or offering suggestions, there will be<br />\na general meeting on Monday,<br />\nSeptember 24th, at 9:00 p.m. in<br />\nthe Glass Pavilion.<br />\n<br />\nThe Squid<br />\nCan wintergreen Lifesavers<br />\nbecome a new energy<br />\nsource?<br />\nThe wintergreen sparking<br />\nis a three step process in<br />\nwhich blue light can be seen<br />\nin the dark.

In both<br />\nweeks we've had a chance to win<br />\nor a chance to tie, which is a<br />\npositive thing after a couple of<br />\ntough seasons. The negative thing<br />\nis obviously not winning.\"<br />\nWhile the Blue Jay defense<br />\nplayed very well in the first<br />\nquarter, the offense was nothing<br />\nshort of atrocious. Their first<br />\nthree series totalled -40 yards<br />\nand was followed by two successive fumbles. The second<br />\nmiscue occured deep in Blue Jay<br />\nterritory and led to Swarthmore's<br />\nfirst score.

We've got to eliminate<br />\nthose things to be competitive,\"<br />\nMargraff noted.<br />\nThose mistakes made starting<br />\nquarterback John Guglielmo a<br />\nproverbial sitting duck. He was<br />\nsacked four times in the first<br />\nquarter and had to throw two<br />\npasses away to avoid the rush. By<br />\nthe beginning of the second<br />\nquarter, Margraff had called on<br />\nScott Cade to replace Guglielmo.<br />\n\"I told the team the first<br />\nquarter was horrendous. Is it<br />\nJohn's fault? No. We dropped a<br />\npass on him, we were holding and<br />\nwe put him in bad situations,\"<br />\nMargraff said. \"We just had to<br />\nchange something. Do you<br />\nchange your left tackle or your<br />\nsplit end in that situation?

After a surperb effort to get control of the ball,<br />\nsophomore forward Roxanne<br />\nTena scored from five yards out<br />\nfor her second goal of.the season,<br />\nputting the Jays ahead 2-0.<br />\nNotre Dame slowly began<br />\nworking the ball down the field<br />\nand looked like they might<br />\nthreaten the Jays control of the<br />\ngame.

Notre<br />\nDame fired several more shots<br />\ntowards the goal but they all missed wide.

It is the<br />\nstress fracture, the injury<br />\nwhich strikes fear into the<br />\n<br />\nhearts of the seven-footers in<br />\nour audience (of which we<br />\nknow there are many). The<br />\nintriguing thing about the<br />\nstress fracture is that it, has<br />\nnothing to do with exams,<br />\ncaffeine, infrequent sex, or<br />\nyoga. A stress fracture is<br />\nwhat a shin splint should be,<br />\na slight crack in the surface<br />\nof the bone which is often<br />\nundetectable by X-ray. The<br />\nareas which are most susceptible to stress fractures are<br />\nthe hands, feet, and legs.<br />\nAnd while your doctor may<br />\nnot be able to see it, you sure<br />\nknow it's there: they tell me<br />\nit hurts like hell. My advice<br />\nto someone with a stress fracture is to avoid any activity<br />\nwhich will extend the crack;<br />\nswimming is your safest bet.<br />\nBut why should you listen to<br />\nme?

The return reflected the<br />\nBlue Jays' only bright spot,<br />\nnamely the special teams. On the<br />\ngame's stat sheet it recorded<br />\nHopkins ahead of Swarthmore in<br />\nevery special team category.

The next competition<br />\nwill be the first of this season's<br />\nfive East Coast Collegiate Karate<br />\nUnion's Tournaments, to be held<br />\nin the Athletic Center from<br />\n12-5:00 p.m. October 27, the<br />\nSaturday of Parents' Weekend.<br />\nThis will be the first home tournament since 1984, and the club<br />\nexpects large participation from<br />\nits estimated 60 regular members.<br />\nThe team expects to host roughly<br />\neight other teams from such<br />\nuniversities as Yale, University of<br />\nPennsylvania, Drexel, Temple,<br />\nUniversity of New Hampshire,<br />\nand University of Massachusetts.<br />\nThe tournament will open with an<br />\nadvanced level demonstration to<br />\nbe followed by both individual<br />\nand team competition at the<br />\nbeginner, intermediate, and advanced levels in both Kumite<br />\n(sparring) and Kata (forms).

During class, basic<br />\nself defense karate skills such as<br />\nkicks, punches, and blocks are<br />\nstressed. Atter warming up, class<br />\nconsists of basic drills, and progresses into sparring. Then forms<br />\nare practiced. After practicing for<br />\nseveral weeks, these awkward<br />\nmovements develop into more<br />\nautomatic and spontaneous reactions.

While<br />\nNotre Dame, Miami, FSU,<br />\nand Auburn face the top teams<br />\nin the land (including each<br />\nother), BYU faces pushovers<br />\nlike New Mexico and Colorado State. So long as the<br />\nCougars continue to win (and<br />\nthey should), they could be national champions without being tested again.

The number of<br />\ntenured professors had dropped<br />\nfrom seven to five over the last<br /><br />\nyear.<br />\nDr. Harari, who was chair of<br />\nthe department for eight of his<br />\neleven years at Hopkins, had<br />\nallowed one medievalist professor<br />\nto go to the University of Virginia<br />\nafter being assured that he would<br />\nbe able to replace him with a<br />\nmodernist, who would fit his<br />\nplans for the department. As a<br />\nresult of the school's financial<br />\ndeficit in 1988, faculty numbers<br />\nwere cut by ten percent. This left<br />\nthe Department of French with<br />\nonly five teaching positions and<br />\nno room to add the planned new<br />\nprofessor.<br />\nThe school \"sacrificed the long<br />\nterm intellectual benefits for temporary financial savings,\" said<br />\nDr. Harari. He believes that the<br /><br />\nfaculty cuts will be detrimental to<br />\nthe quality of the department in<br />\nthe long run.<br />\nRather than hire another permanent faculty member, Dean of<br />\nthe School of Arts and Sciences<br />\nLloyd Armstrong proposed to<br />\nopen a one-year position in the<br />\ndepartment for the next several<br />\nyears. Because of the five year<br />\nplan, he said, the school would<br />\nbe unable to fill the space until<br />\nsome \"financial reshuffling\" had<br />\ntaken place.<br />\nAlthough the French Department would make no comment,<br />\nDean Armstrong expressed his<br /><br />\nfeeling that those who left were<br />\nunwilling to be a part of the solution to the difficulties the school<br />\nwas facing.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Harari, he<br />\nand many others in the department found the solution unsatisfactory.

What universities try to do<br />\nis more ambitious than what colleges try to do, and it seems to<br />\nme that students have the opportunity to take advantage of that<br />\nmore ambitious agenda, but at the<br />\nsame time, they themselves have<br />\nto be more active learners and<br />\nmore willing to take advantage of<br />\nthe opportunities. So it's a more<br />\nchallenging educational environment, both from a teaching pointof-view but also from a learning<br />\npoint-of-view.<br />\nWhat sorts ofissues do you think<br />\nare important to undergraduates?<br />\nI want to make sure that we've<br />\ngot strong programming and<br />\nstrong co-curricular activities<br />\navailable for students in the<br />\nlonger run. It'll take us a while<br /><br />\nto do that, although through some<br />\nof the residence halls and renovation I think we could be constantly improving the quality of space<br />\nand the availability of student<br />\nprograms.<br />\nI don't yet have a good<br />\nunderstanding of the Greek<br />\nsystem at Hopkins, but it plays a<br />\nvery important part in our<br />\nfor<br />\nlife<br />\nUniversity's<br />\nundergraduates. About a third of<br />\nour students are in fraternities or<br />\nsororities, and I think that's an<br />\nimportant part of undergraduate<br />\nlife for a significant number of<br />\nstudents. We want to be sure that<br />\nwe're providing the kind of support which that system typically<br />\nneeds.<br />\nI'd like to make sure that<br />\nundergraduates feel that they have<br />\na voice in the academic life of the<br />\nUniversity. In fact, we've done<br />\nsome things just in the beginning<br />\nof this year to try to get freshmen<br />\nthinking of the way they can be<br />\nparticipating in the life of the<br />\nUniversity. I had a Freshman<br />\nConvocation, for example, the<br />\nfirst week that the freshmen were<br />\nhere,[and told them] that, in addition to the academic life of the<br />\nUniversity, there is so much else<br />\nto be gained from an<br />\nundergraduate education: friend-<br /><br />\nships across groups, diverse<br />\ngroups which you might not<br />\nexperience\u2014<br />\notherwise<br />\nparticularly those who come from<br />\nhigh schools that are more<br />\nhomogeneous than Hopkins; taking advantage of opportunities to<br />\nparticipate with the community,<br />\nto give back of our talents to people that are less fortunate of<br />\nwhich there are many; the opportunity to establish experience in<br />\norganization\u2014Orientation, for<br />\nexample, which is a big organizational feat. All these are chances<br />\nfor people to learn and to grow<br />\noutside of the classroom, and I<br />\nthink a university or college has<br />\na responsibility to make sure their<br />\nundergraduates have those kinds<br />\nof experiences.<br />\nEverything happens more<br />\nslowly than I'd like it to happen.<br />\nI like action. But I've recognized over the years that I have to<br />\ntemper that inclination for action<br />\nwith reality. Financially, for example, we can't move as far and<br />\nas fast in the residence halls as I'd<br />\nlike to [but], on the other hand<br />\nwe're undertaking a very major<br />\nseries of steps. We've just finished one [building], we have<br />\nWolman now, and then we'll be<br />\nstarting the third one next summer. So we've got that mapped<br /><br />\nout and that's moving ahead in a<br />\nvery effective way, I think. But<br />\nif you asked, \"Hey, would you<br />\nlike to have it all done right<br />\nnow?\" the answer would be<br />\n\"yes.\"<br />\nI would like to see improved<br />\nathletic facilities, particularly a<br />\nnew building, or an addition to<br />\nthe building, and I know, in due<br />\ncourse, we'll do that. I certainly<br />\nintend, as one of my priorities, to<br />\nbe working on the feasibility for<br />\na Homewood fundraising campaign. And if we could incorporate that in, and it's feasible to<br />\nincorporate that in, I'd like to,<br />\nbecause I think that's something<br />\nthat we need.<br />\nI think our residence hall<br />\nsystem, and the approach that<br />\nwehave of advisors in the<br />\nresidence halls (Housemasters<br />\nand so on), from what I can<br />\nunderstand, seems to be a very<br />\nwell-received and very effective<br />\nsystem. We had a system like that<br />\nat Trinity College, where I was<br />\none, and it was something that I<br />\ngot a lot out of and I think was<br />\ngood for the other students. And,<br />\nof course, we have a range of<br />\nresidence halls, too. If you can<br />\ncontrast Rogers on the one hand<br />\nto some of the very large<br />\nresidence halls on the other, it's<br />\na challenge to go from one to the<br />\nother. But the intimacy of Rogers<br />\nand the effectiveness that the<br />\nHousemaster of Rogers can have<br />\non that rather small, and, I guess,<br />\nhigh-morale, almost family like<br />\ngroup of students is something we<br />\nought to try to replicate in almost<br />\nall that we do.<br />\nI came from a very big university. We had a total of 70,000<br />\nstudents at Penn State, and at the<br />\nUniversity Park campus, we had<br />\n29,000. They almost never felt<br />\nlike they were a part of a big<br />\nuniversity, except when they<br />\nwanted to. It was a place that had<br />\nan intimate feel to it because there<br />\nwere lots and lots of groups, lots<br />\nand lots of sub-arrangements for<br />\nhousing, through the Greek<br />\nsystem, and through the offcampus apartment housing that<br />\nwas available to students as well<br />\nas our on-campus housing.<br />\n(There were about 13,000.) But<br />\npeople had the sense of a small<br />\nplace because they were able to<br />\nwork in smaller groups and clubs.<br />\nHow is this approach different<br />\nfrom the \"corporate\"approach?<br />\nI think that over the years<br />\nHopkins will evolve. I don't<br />\nknow what it would be at this<br />\npoint, but I think Hopkins will<br />\nevolve a modified way of looking at the way in which it accounts for its resources. It seems<br />\nto me as we move on, we're going to have to grow and develop<br />\nnew approaches and new<br />\nunderstandings that both take into account the differences in costs<br />\nand style of various places and the<br />\nopportunities for garnering<br />\nresources from outside the<br />\nUniversity. Some areas are better able to do that than others\u2014<br />\nsome are able to do that from<br />\ngrant/contract sources, for example, while others might be better<br />\nable to do that from philanthropic<br />\nsources. I think we need to<br />\nrecognize those differences and<br />\ntake advantage of them where we<br />\nsee them.<br />\nWe also need to have a University that is greater than the sum<br />\nof its parts. The idea that Hopkins<br />\nis simply a co-activity of separate<br />\nschools or divisions is not appealing to me because this is a university, and we need all to be contributing to the broader university role in our society and beyond,<br />\nand I think each division has its<br />\npart to play.<br /><br />\nGoodFellas<br />\nA MARTIN SCORSESE PICTURE<br /><br />\nNThree Decades of Life in the Mafia.<br /><br />\nHow would you deal with changing the existing structure?<br /><br />\nMINER BOOS.<br />\nMARTIN SCOIIS[SE [ion GOONMAS ROBERT DE NIf10 \u2022 HAY HOTTA \u2022 JOE PESCI<br />\n11,11101IN WINKLED<br />\nLORRAINE BRACCO PAR SOD VINO 'Fixrec dutliget BARBARA DE FINA \"sel:Vb1 NICHOLAS MEG'<br />\n\"rm't NICHO[AS PIIIGGI &amp; MARTIN SCORSESE PIodunlRffN WINKLER<br />\nIlev\u00b0 MARTIN SCORSESE<br />\nP<br /><br />\nWARNER BROS.<br /><br />\nUNOEN IT MOINES ACCOMPANYING<br />\nPARENT DI ADULT GUARDIAN<br /><br />\n[SOiniacIhuranilao1Ic<br /><br />\nRecords faiiites and CDs]<br /><br />\n7MPANV<br />\nA TIME WARNEP<br />\nt orteI,.PLIble Rrovr.11<br /><br />\nSTARTS FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 21st<br /><br />\nThe process is very important.<br />\nWe have to make sure that the<br />\nfaculties and the students and the<br />\nleadership of the divisions participate in an examination of the<br />\nway we're doing things now and<br />\nreview options of the way in<br />\nwhich we might do things in the<br />\nfuture.

In addition to that, there is<br />\nsomething known as the President's Advisory and Policy Committee, which [comprises] the<br />\nVice Presidents and the general<br />\ncouncil. I meet with each of these<br />\ngroups once a month. The groups<br />\nwill all have a role in discussing<br />\nthe formulation of whatever<br />\ndirections or options that we<br />\ndevelop and are available to us.<br />\nIn addition, there will be an<br />\ninter-divisional faculty group with<br />\ntwo representatives from each of<br />\nthe schools, and that group I will<br />\nuse as a sounding board for any<br />\nideas that I come up with. Beyond<br />\nthat, there are the councils and<br />\nacademic boards within the divisions, and, of course, the student<br />\ngovernments and student<br />\nrepresentation.<br />\nSo there is a whole variety of<br />\ngroups and forums which can be<br />\nused for feedback, ideas and so<br />\non. Whether there would be some<br />\nsort of ad hoc arrangement on top<br />\nof that, I don't know, but I would<br />\nhope not. I would hope that we<br />\ncan develop a more systematic<br />\nkind of advisory structure that<br />\nwill be effective and stable and<br />\nwon't require us to do ad hoc<br />\nthings as much.<br />\nDo you think student input is important in planning aspects ofthe<br />\nUniversity's future?<br />\nAbsolutely.

One of the biggest surprises to me, when I came to<br />\nHopkins, was how the degree to<br />\nwhich Hopkins itself, and the way<br />\nin which it portrayed itself, had<br />\nreflected a situation that was<br />\nperceived as negative, when, in<br />\nfact, Hopkins is very, very<br />\nstrong.lt really is a very strong<br />\nuniversity. There's a tendency to<br />\ndo two or three things. One is to<br />\ncompare Hopkins today with<br />\nwhat Hopkins was 15 or 20 years<br />\nago, and, in the course of that, to<br /><br />\nnot look at what has happened to<br />\nArts and Sciences colleges<br />\neverywhere and the effects of the<br />\neconomics of the last 15 years on<br />\ngraduate education as well as<br />\nundergraduate education.<br />\nHopkins was starting from a<br />\nvery, very selective high ground<br />\nin terms of almost any measure<br />\nthat you could want, and it continues to be in that same relative<br />\nposition compared to many other<br />\ncolleges and universities.

If you look at it overall,<br />\nwe're all right. I think that if you<br />\nlook at it group by group, division by division, Or even<br />\ndiscipline by discipline then my<br />\nguess is that there are some<br />\ndisciplines which need additional<br />\nfaculty and others that could get<br />\nalong with what they have.<br />\nIn light ofthe problemsfacing the<br />\nundergraduate program at<br />\nHopkins (e.g. budget problems,<br />\ndecreased enrollment, class<br />\navailability and sizes, etc.), how<br />\ndo you plan to uphold the standards of Hopkins education?<br />\nWe're going to establish what<br />\nthe standard is that we think is<br />\nmost compatible with the nature<br />\nof the University, the arrangements which we have in<br />\nrespect to graduate and<br />\nundergraduate education, and the<br />\ntype of faculty that we have. That<br />\nwill be done through discussion<br />\nin the Homewood Academic<br />\nCouncil. We'll do it through an<br />\nacademic planning process, a lot<br />\nof which has already been accomplished (for example, in the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences<br />\nthrough the leadership of Dean<br />\nArmstrong), and we'll arrive at<br />\nwhat we consider to be, from an<br />\nacademic point-of-view, the appropriate balance, with respect to,<br />\nfor example, numbers of faculty<br />\nin Arts and Sciences. That has to<br />\nbo on during the course of this<br />\nyear, and I want to have that process informed by academic considerations and not simply<br />\nbudgetary considerations...<br />\nAs far as the quality of the incoming freshman class, it's the<br />\nsame as the quality of last year's<br />\nand, in fact, is a few students<br />\nlarger. [It's true that] there is a<br />\ndecreasing pool of high school<br />\ngraduates, but it hasn't affected<br />\nHopkins yet. I have no way of<br />\njudging what the effect will be [in<br />\nthe future'. So far, the selective<br />\nuniversities and colleges have not<br />\nfound it to be a problem.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\nHILLCREST CLINIC<br /><br />\nTAKE A LIBRARY<br />\nTOUR!!<br /><br />\nPrompt confidential help<br />\n\u2022 FREE PREGNANCY TESTING<br />\n\u2022 ABORTION SERVICES<br />\n\u2022 BIRTH CONTROL SERVICES<br />\nFOR APPOINTMENTS CALL:<br /><br />\n1 788-44001<br />\n'll \u2022<br /><br />\npw<br /><br />\n\u2022SONOGRAMS<br />\n\u2022 COUNSELING .<br />\n\u2022 COMMUNITY EDUCATION<br /><br />\nOpen Mon Sat<br />\n8 30 51.!Opm<br /><br />\n0<br />\nSEM,<br />\n.i dia<br />\nim<br />\n5.4 !<br /><br />\n,<br />\n5602 Baltimore National Pike *600<br /><br />\n--<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n. 0<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\nThe Milton S.

It always seemed odd<br />\nto try to reserve a seat in class,<br />\nlike it were some concert that you<br />\nwanted the best possible seat for.<br />\nBut, every day, Zack told her,<br />\n\"Save me a seat,\" so she did.<br />\nThis way she could be sure that<br />\nZack sat close enough to the front<br />\nthat he couldn't help but pay attention. And then, if he did find<br />\na way, she could always kick him<br />\nsurreptitiously.<br />\nShe pulled the attached desk<br />\naround the arm of the chair and<br />\nset her notebook on it. It barely<br />\nfit. Whoever designed these attachable desks for auditoriums<br />\ndidn't have function as a high<br />\npriority. Not even a low priority. A person had to be a<br />\ncontortionist to write in one, let<br />\nalone at the speed to take notes<br />\nThe desk (or facsimile thereof)<br />\nnext to her slammed down. It was<br />\nZack.<br />\n\"What'd you get?\" Miranda<br />\nasked.<br />\n\"Mmrnm,\" muttered Zack, a<br />\nhum that Miranda had learned to<br />\ntranslate as \"a Mounds bar and<br />\na Coke. Now let me sleep.\"<br />\nZack slid down in his chair<br />\nabout as far as his back would<br />\nallow without breaking, opened<br />\nhis notebook, and scribbled<br />\n\"Psychology Notes-11/15\" effortlessly at the top of the page.<br />\nObviously that was the secret of<br />\nthe desks of doom: one had to be<br />\nhalf-asleep and mostly horizontal.<br />\nMiranda heard Professor<br />\nMulvihill before she saw her. The<br />\n\"tak-tak-tak\" of the teacher's red<br />\nhigh heels always preceded her<br />\nactual appearance. Miranda opened her notebook to start some<br />\nnotes, but instead found an unfinished letter to David. Oh joy.<br />\nMiranda had been going out<br />\nwith David for three years. Unfortunately, she'd only been at<br />\nschool for two and a half, meaning David was still at home in San<br />\nDiego. Unfortunately, this meant<br />\nthat Miranda only got to see him<br />\nthree months out of the year. On<br />\nthe other hand, though, it gave<br />\nher a fine excuse to be as<br />\nantisocial as she wanted. Aside<br />\nfrom her roommates, Daris ond<br />\nCarol, the only real friend she<br />\nspent much time with was. . .<br />\nsnoring in the chair next to her.<br />\n\"Zack!\" she whispered. Zack<br /><br />\nstarted and looked at her. So did<br />\nProfessor Mulvihill. Miranda sat<br />\nmeekly as the glare passed over<br />\nher. Miranda went back to her<br />\nnotes. Professor Mulvihill went<br />\nback to speaking about Carol<br />\nGilligan. Zack went back to<br />\nsleep.<br />\nThe next half hour went by as<br />\nit usually did in Psychology class.<br />\nMiranda desperately scribbled illegible scrawls in her notebook<br />\ntrying not to miss a word of the<br />\nlecture, all the while nudging<br />\nZack any time his body fell below<br /><br />\n'Whoever designed<br />\nthese desks<br />\ndidn't have<br />\nfunction as a<br />\nhigh priority...<br />\na forty-five degree angle. About<br />\nhalfway through class he finally<br />\nnoticed that he was awake and<br />\nasked Miranda what was going<br />\non.<br />\nMiranda had anticipated this,<br />\nand answered him, \"She's talking about Carol Gilligan.\" This<br />\nwould answer Zack's question<br />\nwhile still leaving him completely<br />\nin the dark about what was going<br />\non. Miranda smiled a bit. If the<br />\nboy wasn't going to pay attention<br /><br />\nNot even a low priority.<br />\nto class, well.<br />\n\"Yo, Miranda,\" whispered<br />\nZack. Miranda looked over and<br />\nalready Zack's notebook was<br />\ncovered with some strange doodle of people and grass huts.<br />\n\"What's that?\" Miranda asked, taking the bait.<br />\n\"Look,\" Zack said.<br />\nMiranda looked. The caption<br />\nbelow the picture read, \"Carol<br />\nGilligan's Island.\" The large person blob was saying to a small<br />\nperson blob in a dress,\"So little<br />\nbuddy, how about a nightcap?\"<br />\nThe smaller blob replied, \"Now,<br />\nSkipper, you know that as a<br />\ngender, we find remarks like that<br />\ndemeaning.\" Miranda found the<br />\nidea of Carol Gilligan walking<br />\naround in a red shirt and white hat<br />\nall the taime a thought so deranged<br />\nthat it could only come from Zack.<br />\n. . which is Carol Gilligan's<br />\n4<br /><br />\n4.<br /><br />\nOpinion<br />\nLoss of Stellar French Department<br />\nIllustrates Unique Problems<br />\nMany of the undergraduate students who pass<br />\nthrough the halls of Johns Hopkins, particularly<br />\nthose who study the sciences, are probably unaware<br />\nof the high-powered academics available to them<br />\nin some of the humanities departments. In general,<br />\nundergraduates tend to tow the superficial university line: Hopkins is a school for scientists,<br />\nespecially pre-medical students.<br /><br />\nAchieving the strength and prestige the French<br />\ndepartment had achieved with its limited faculty<br />\nsize required a delicate balance of faculty members'<br />\ntalents and areas of interest. And it goes without<br />\nsaying that each faculty member had to be strong<br />\nindividually. The department had to simulate<br />\nphysical depth and breadth through a carefully<br />\nplanned and managed collection of unique, exceptional scholars.<br /><br />\nStudents studying the humanities may come to<br />\nHopkins a little better informed about the opportunities available in other areas. All certainly gain<br />\nan understanding of the import of Hopkins' small,<br />\ndiverse, and prestigious humanities faculty as they<br />\nprogress through their academic program here.<br /><br />\nThus, when over half the department left, the<br />\nUniversity lost much more than a few professors,<br />\nand experienced much more than a temporary setback in a marginal department. The loss to the<br />\nUniversity is nonrecoverable, and starting from<br />\nscratch means building something totally new.<br />\nRebuilding takes time, talent, and effort\u2014and a<br />\nstrong upper-level administrative commitment.<br /><br />\nHowever, such academic standouts as the<br />\nDepartment of French go largely unrecognized here<br />\nat Hopkins. Even an undergraduate who decides<br />\nto major in French may not realize the stature of<br />\nthe scholars teaching her classes. Her peers certainly do not understand that while they may be<br />\nat the number one pre-medical institution in the<br />\nUnited States, she too is a part\u2014and a bigger part,<br />\nproportionately\u2014of one of the top departments in<br />\nthe country in her field.<br />\nAll of this to bring into focus the loss Hopkins<br />\nexperienced when over half of the French department left for Emory University last spring. Despite<br />\nHopkins' small size and supposedly favored commitment to sciences, the French department was<br />\none of the top three in the country. This is astounding when one considers the size of and resources<br />\navailable to those universities with departments<br />\nranked well below those of Hopkins.<br /><br />\nFaculty moves like the ones made by Josef Harari<br />\nand his colleagues last spring are not all that exceptional. But, as is often the case here, the<br />\nqualities which makes Hopkins a singular institution also leave the University uniquely vulnerable.<br />\nThe delicate balance that allowed Hopkins to surpass its peers crumbled quickly and irretrievably;<br />\nthe damage is felt more acutely and overcome less<br />\neasily than would be the case elsewhere.<br />\nThe French department as its former self was<br />\nnot an anomaly. Rather, its uniquely structured<br />\nacademic strength is exemplary of several other<br />\ndepartments at Hopkins, as well as at the University as a whole. Like the French department, these<br />\nother areas are uniquely vulnerable. How much<br />\nmore of this type of damage can the University suffer without losing its grip on the delicate balance<br />\nthat allows it to achieve its level of excellence?<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Black and Blue Jay Gets Submissive; A Racist Slur<br />\nRecalled from Spring Fair; Fishing for 'The Right Angle'<br />\nDear JHU Community:<br /><br />\nhas the right to deface any other<br />\ngroup's posters.

Does it not at least<br />\nhelp to dispense information<br />\nabout ROTC programs to prospective students including the<br />\nNews-Letter (see page 5 of last<br />\nweek's edition)? Those who feel<br />\nthe University does not take an<br />\nactive role in administering<br />\nROTC activities at Hopkins are<br />\nclearly mistaken.<br />\nThe fact that the present<br />\nmilitary policies regarding gays<br />\nand lesbians are baseless does not<br />\nseem to matter to policy makers<br />\nin the Deparment of Defense or<br />\nthe administration of the University. On September 2, 1990, the<br />\nNew York Times published an article which began \"The commander of the Navy's surface<br />\nAtlantic fleet has characterized<br />\nlesbian sailors as 'among the<br />\ncommand's top performers' but<br />\ntold his officers that homosexual<br />\nwomen must be vigorously rooted<br />\nout of service.\" The military continues to forcibly discharge about<br />\n1,400 gays and lesbians each<br />\nyear, with lesbians dicharged at<br />\nthree times the rate of gay men.<br />\nThe article also refers to<br />\nRepresentative Gerry E. Studd's<br />\ndisclosure last year of two studies<br />\nconducted by the Pentagon which<br />\n\"found no evidence that homsexuals disrupted the armed forces,<br />\nPaul DelGrosso is president of<br />\npraised their performance, and<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Gay and Les- urged<br />\ntheir retention.\" These<br />\nbian Alliance.<br /><br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nContinued from page 6<br />\nprime contribution to Psychology<br />\nToday.\" The voice of Professor<br />\nMulvihill making An Important<br />\nPoint distracted Miranda from<br />\nZack's reverie.<br />\n\"What did she say?\" Miranda<br />\nasked Zack. \"what was the main<br />\npoint?\"<br />\n\"Huh? Oh, I don't know. I<br />\nwasn't listening.\"<br />\nThere was some sort of commotion in the classroom, and as<br />\nMiranda turned to ask the person<br />\non the left, she found that there<br />\nwas no one there. In fact, most<br />\neveryone was leaving.<br />\nClass was over. Miranda spun<br />\nabout, desperately looking for someone who knew what Carol<br /><br />\nGilligan's prime contribution to<br />\npsychology today was. The rest<br />\nof the class was pouring out<br />\nthrough the doors in the back of<br />\nthe auditorium. She tried to get<br />\nup and discovered the other thing<br />\nshe hated about the desks from<br />\nhell. She couldn't get out of them.<br />\n\"Zack,\" she asked, \"could<br />\nyou give me a hand with my<br />\nseat?\"<br />\nNext: Lunch with Miranda proves<br />\nto be a cross between As The<br />\nWorld Turns and Revenge ofthe<br />\nBlob. Which will do her in first,<br />\nthe cafeteria experience or the<br />\nrevelation<br />\nabout Zack's<br />\nex-girlfriend?<br /><br />\nreports were initially suppressed<br />\nby the Department of Defense,<br />\nwhich later dismissed them as<br />\n\"draft recommendations\"<br />\nbecause they were \"not responsive to the original research request.\" The military, which<br />\nsystematically roots out its top<br />\nperformers, obviously is not rational enough to be respected on<br />\nthis issue.<br />\nAlso interesting is the similarity<br />\nbetween the military's previous<br />\nattitude regarding black members<br />\nof the armed services and the present one regarding gays and lesbians. In a December 24, 1941,<br />\nmemorandum outlining the basis<br />\nof the military's exclusion of<br />\nblacks, the armed services explain: \"The close and intimate<br />\nconditions of life aboard ship, the<br />\nnecessity for the highest possible<br />\ndegree of unity and esprit-decorps, the requirement of<br />\nmorale\u2014all these demand that<br />\nnothing be done which may<br />\nadversely affect the situation. Past<br />\nexperiences have shown irrefutably that the enlistment of<br />\nNegroes (other than for mess attendants) leads to disruptive and<br />\nundermining conditions.\" Compare this with the present<br />\nmilitary's stance against gays and<br /><br />\nlesbians. \"Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.<br />\nThe presence of such members<br />\nadversely affects the ability of the<br />\nArmed Forces to maintain<br />\ndiscipline, good order, and<br />\nmorale; to foster mutual trust and<br />\nconfidence among the members;<br />\nto ensure the integrity of the<br />\nsystem of rank and command; to<br />\nfacilitate assignment and<br />\nworldwide deployment of<br />\nmembers who frequently must<br /><br />\nAs long as ROTC<br />\noperates under a<br />\ndiscriminatory policy,<br />\nHopkins should<br />\n'Just say no'<br />\nlive and work under close conditions affording minimal privacy;<br />\nto recruit and retain members of<br />\nthe military services; to maintain<br />\nthe public acceptability of<br />\nmilitary services; and, in certain<br />\ncircumstances, to prevent<br />\nbreaches of security.\" The<br />\nmilitary continues to prove time<br />\nand time again that the only real<br />\nproblem with mofdle is among<br />\nthose who appeal to emotion<br />\nContinued on page 8<br /><br />\nand he becomes testy at any statement from the press which insinuates that he does.<br />\nSouter has been quite evasive<br />\nabout the question himself.<br />\nRepeatedly in the confirmation<br />\nhearings, Democratic Senators<br />\nhave attempted to nail him down<br />\nto a specific position. Repeatedly Souter has adroitly sidestepped<br />\nthe question by refusing to reveal<br /><br />\nSouter has remained<br />\ntight-lipped<br />\nabout abortion<br />\neither his personal or legal position on Roe v. Wade.<br />\nThis refusal to let his feelings<br />\nbe known about abortion have led<br />\nsome pro-choice groups to insist<br />\nthat Souter is unfit to serve on the<br />\nSupreme Court. Never mind that<br />\nhe possesses an excellent educational and legal background and<br />\nthat most who have come into<br />\ncontact with him firmly believe<br />\nthat he will be a capable justice.<br />\nBut such minor details haven't<br />\nprevented these groups from<br />\nderailing talented nominees in the<br />\npast.<br />\nRemember the rhetorical war<br />\nthat prevented Robert Bork from<br />\nbecoming a justice in 1987? Bork<br />\nbegan confirmation hearings acclaimed as one of the most<br />\ntalented nominees in many years.<br />\nYet Bork had made the mistake<br />\nof leaving an extensive \"paper<br />\ntrail,\" allowing posturing<br />\nmembers of the Judiciary Committee to have political (not legal)<br />\nreasons to attack him. The conservative legal philosophy that he<br />\nhad spelled out in writing provided the ammunition for his foes to<br />\nmount a media campaign, which<br />\nBork had no chance to overcome.<br />\nEventually, that campaign led<br />\nto the nomination of Anthony<br />\nKennedy to the Supreme Court.<br />\nSupposedly more moderate than<br />\nBork, Kennedy has proven to be<br />\na much more consistent conservative voice than many believe<br />\nBork would have been.

The National<br />\nOrganization of Women(NOW)<br />\npresident is quite upset at the impending loss of liberty for all<br />\nwomen in the United States. The<br />\nascension of David Souter to the<br />\nSupreme Court, as Yard claimed before the Senate Judiciary<br />\nCommittee on Tuesday, would<br />\nmean \"ending freedom for<br />\nwomen in this country.\"<br />\nBut sometime within the next<br />\nmonth, the U.S. Senate will, in<br />\nall likelihood, vote to confirm<br />\nSouter to the highest court in the<br />\nland. Yet in the wake of the continuing Iraq-Kuwait showdown,<br />\nand due to the lack of much in the<br />\nway of real controversy, the<br />\nSouter confirmation hearings<br />\ndrew relatively scant press<br />\ncoverage.<br />\nTo his advantage, Souter has<br />\nbeen able to keep a much lower<br />\nprofile than recent nominees to<br />\nthe Court. As has been well<br />\ndocumented, the New Hampshire<br />\njudge has masterfully prevented<br />\npotential adversaries from learning much about his views on important issues, chiefly by failing<br />\nto leave behind the sort of\"paper<br />\ntrail\" that can reveal a judge's<br />\nproclivities on politically sensitive<br />\nissues.<br />\nFor the most part, the only<br />\nquestions which come directly<br />\nfrom Souter's past stem from his<br />\nactivities as New Hampshire State<br />\nAttorney General. The most controversial issue in which he was<br />\ninvolved concerned an affirmative action case. Souter fought<br />\nfederal regulations that require<br />\nNew Hampshire to provide information about the racial composition of its work force. Some civil<br />\nrights groups, including the<br />\nMexican-American<br />\nLegal<br />\nDefense Fund, have announced<br />\ntheir opposition to Souter for such<br />\nprevious actions.<br />\nWhat is conspicuously absent<br />\nfrom Souter's past, interestingly, is any opinion on the most<br />\ndecisive issue in today's society.<br />\nAt this point, no one claims to<br />\nknow exactly where David Souter<br />\nstands on abortion.

The article spoke of a feeling that \"Something is wrong in<br />\nthe academy, or at least that part<br />\nof it that is supposed to educate<br />\nundergraduates.\"<br />\nAs a Hopkins undergraduate,<br />\nthis article concerned me deeply.<br />\nLater I read a copy of President<br />\nRichardson's convocation address<br />\nto see if he mentioned the greater<br />\npurpose of undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins. My purpose was to see<br />\nif he acknowledged, unlike his<br />\npredecessor, the problems with<br />\nundergraduate education. His<br />\nspeech, less eloquent on paper<br />\nthan in person, said that Hopkins,<br />\n\"reserves its greatest rewards for<br />\nthe tenacious, the persistant, and<br />\nthe assertive.\"<br />\nThat line, at face value, appears to make sense. After all,<br />\nHopkins did not introduce<br /><br />\nmodern undergraduate education<br />\nto this country, it introduced<br />\ngraduate education. But upon further reflection, Richardson's<br />\nstatement does not make sense.<br />\nLast spring, President Bush spoke<br />\non campus to honor Johns<br />\nHopkins' role in medicine. Outside Shriver Hall were protesters<br />\nnoting the irony in giving Bush<br />\nan honorary degree while his<br />\nbudget proposed slashing funding<br />\nfor medical research.<br />\nIt seems to me that President<br />\nRichardson is doing the same<br />\nthing. While speaking of student<br />\ninitiative, he is steadily decreasing the opportunities for<br />\nundergaduates to receive a<br />\n\"Hopkins\" undergraduate education. There was a time when introductory Biology had a required<br />\nlab. Today a freshman must try<br />\nand find some kind of independent research if he wants any type<br />\nof laboratory experience.<br />\nThe<br />\nparallels<br />\nbetween<br />\nPresidents Richardson and Bush<br /><br />\nare so similar that they're eerie.<br />\nBoth have produced solid, if not<br />\nstandard backrounds. It would be<br />\na close race to see who could<br />\nscamper away from controversy<br />\nfirst. Both appear to be in control<br />\nbut events seem to slip away from<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe article closed stating<br />\nthat many schools are trying to evaluate their approaches<br />\nto undergraduate education. Stanford's President Donald Kennedy<br />\nstated, \"It is time for us to reaffirm that education\u2014that is<br />\nteaching in all its forms\u2014is the<br />\nprimary task, and our society will<br />\njudge us in the long run on how<br />\nwell we do it.\"<br />\nAs an undergraduate, one can<br />\nonly hope that President Richardson steps to plate and leads<br />\nHopkins to defining the true role<br />\nof its undergraduate component<br />\nand the university's dedication to<br />\nit. Otherwise, undergraduates<br />\nwill need a lot more than initiative<br />\nto be successful here.<br /><br />\nGet Rid of ROTC<br />\n99<br />\nTaste delicious\"TM:Frozen Yogurt.

While other major universities and colleges(Harvard, MIT, Princeton, and Yale,<br />\nto name only a few) have either<br />\ndeveloped a reponse to ROTC<br />\ndiscrimination or are presently<br />\ndoing so, Hopkins has done absolutely nothing about the issue.<br />\nThe new president of the university, Dr. William C. Richardson,<br />\nrecently asked the deans to set up<br />\na committee of students, faculty,<br />\nand staff to discuss the issue. This<br />\ncommittee, however, has been<br />\nslow to form and is still in the<br />\ndevelopment stages. Obviously,<br />\ndiscrimination against gay and<br />\nlesbian students does not concern<br />\nsome members of the administration all that much or the committee would have been formed in a<br /><br />\nmore timely manner.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University Gay and Lesbian Alliance is<br />\ncalling for President Richardson<br />\nto act immediately on this issue.<br />\nBaseless discrimination against<br />\ngays and lesbians or any minority group at this university is unacceptable to the members of<br />\nGALA. To gradually phase out<br />\nROTC at Hopkins\u2014by allowing<br />\nthose currently enrolled in the<br />\nprogram to finish, but preventing<br />\nany new sudents from joining\u2014<br />\nis the fairest solution to all concerned.The position of the Gay<br />\nand Lesbian Alliance has always<br />\nbeen anti-discrimination, not antiROTC. If and when the Department of Defense comes to its<br />\nsenses and allows gays and lesbians to officially exist within an<br />\norganization where they already<br />\nexist and have proven to function<br />\nwell, then and only then should<br />\nROTC be allowed to return to<br />\nHopkins.

Even before its<br />\nopening tonight in Baltimore,<br />\nGoodFellas is being debated on<br />\nthe evening news. One ItalianAmerican representative has said<br />\nit is the worst thing to happen to<br />\nItalians in this country in years.<br />\nSo far, Scorsese himself has not<br />\nspoken, choosing to allow the<br />\nfilm to speak for itself.<br />\nThe story of GoodFellas<br />\nrevolves around a group of<br />\nMafiosos, or \"wiseguys,\" in a<br />\ntight-knit Italian community.<br />\nHenry (Ray Liotta) is a young and<br />\nambitious Irish-Italian mobster,<br />\nwho narrates over flashbacks<br />\nabout how, at age 13, he got a job<br />\nwith the cab company across the<br /><br />\nstreet, run by well-known Mafia<br />\nmen. He begins making<br />\ndeliveries, then selling stolen<br />\ncigarette shipments, then blowing<br />\nup cars. His coming-of-age takes<br />\nplace in a court-room lobby,<br />\nwhen his bosses hug him for<br />\nsliding out of his first arrest. \"It<br />\nwas,\" as Henry says, \"a glorious<br />\ntime.\"<br />\nHenry collaborates with Jimmy<br />\n(Robert DeNiro), a seasoned<br />\nthief, hijacker and hitman, and<br />\nthe two plan half-million dollar<br />\nheists in thirty-second chats over<br />\ndrinks. Henry is seduced by the<br />\nglamour and power of his new<br />\nposition.

While the crime comes off<br />\nwithout a hitch (at least at first),<br />\nthe community itself begins to<br />\ncave in under the weight of its<br />\nown contradictions.<br />\nGoodFellas is not notable for<br />\nits plot. Scorsese has never been<br />\nknown as a storyteller, and like<br /><br />\nmost of his films, the narration in<br />\nGoodFellas is loose at best. What<br />\nis most intriguing about the film<br />\nis its portrayal of an odd and<br />\nrarely-seen community, a warm<br />\nand affectionate family of men<br />\nwho, for reasons known only to<br />\nthem, kill each other from time<br />\nto time.<br />\nAs in Coppola's Godfather<br />\nfilms, the focus here is on the<br />\nways in which personal attachments to family and friends<br />\nintrude on the business of killing<br />\nand vice versa. Throughout the<br />\nfilm, Scorsese shows us an odd<br />\nand volatile mixture of warmth<br />\nand anger, of violence and<br />\ncultural tradition. In one scene,<br />\nTommy has a barroom audience<br />\nroaring with laughter\u2014until the<br />\nproprietor asks him to pay his<br />\nbill, when he slams a bottle over<br />\nthe man's head.

This<br />\nweekend, the 22nd International<br />\nTournee of Animation appears at<br />\nShriver Hall, featuring 18 awardwinning cartoon shorts from<br />\naround the world.<br />\nThis is not going to be \"HeMan.\" These are cartoons as art,<br />\ncartoons that demonstrate that the<br />\nmedia can do more than amuse,<br />\nbut also tell stories with emotional<br />\ndepth and didactic power. Some<br />\nof them are hilariously funny,<br />\nothers incomprehensibly weird,<br />\nwhile still others are touchig and<br />\nmeaningful.<br />\nOn the fun side, there is<br />\n\"Kakania\" (USA), the hip and<br />\nhypnotizing dance of modern urban chaos set against a rhythmic<br />\norder of tribal cultures. There is<br />\n\"Sand Dance\" (USA), a jazzy<br />\ndance number with figures<br />\nanimated from sand silhouettes.<br />\nAnd there is \"A Touch of<br />\nDeceit\"(Canada), which begins,<br />\nlike a lyrical Disney film but<br />\ndoesn't stay that way for very<br />\nlong. \"Gisele Kerozene\"<br /><br />\n(France) is a pixillated chase<br />\nscene on broomstick through the<br />\nCity of the Future.<br />\n\"A Very, Very Long Time<br />\nAgo\"(USA)dramatizes the farcical origin-moment of human<br />\nevolution, and in \"Juke Bar\"<br />\n(Canada), a juke box installed in<br />\na cheesy diner becomes a<br />\nplayground and dancehall to a<br />\nswarm of frenzied cockroaches.<br />\nOn top of this, the whole series is<br />\npunctuated with ten-second<br />\nPlymptoons, hilarious vignettes<br />\nfrom the Far Side-esque world of<br />\ncartoonist Bill Plympton.<br />\nSome of the cartoons, on the<br />\nother hand, make serious<br />\nthematic statements. \"The Cow\"<br />\n(USSR), about a steppe family's<br />\nrelationship with the animal, is<br />\ndrawn with a hazy impressionism, and images that seem<br />\nalmost out of an old family<br />\nalbum\u2014 blurred gently, as if seen<br />\nthrough a sheet of water. \"Pictures of Memory\" (Yugoslavia)<br />\nis a stream of consciousness<br />\nrecollection of the early 20th century through a series of flipping<br />\nliving photographs.<br />\nIn \"The Coiling Prankster\"<br />\n(USSR), a human figure constructs himself and his world<br />\nfrom a coil of wire, struggling to<br />\npreserve his privacy in the face<br /><br />\nof outsiders. And most impressively, in \"Balance\" (Germany), five lone figures stand<br />\nbalanced on a tilted platform in<br />\nempty space, their survival<br />\ndependent on the movement of<br />\nthe others. It leaves an eerie and<br />\npowerful statement behind, and<br />\none that should keep you thinking for a long time.<br />\nThere are also some relatively<br />\nweak entries. \"Cat and Rat\"<br />\n(USA) is a cross-dimensional<br />\nmeta-cartoon with a simplistic<br />\nTom and Jerry storyline. \"Warm<br />\nReception in LA\"(USA) is just<br />\nbland and cute at best, both artistically and thematically. And<br />\nworst of all was \"Shadrach\"<br />\n(USA), an animated homage to,<br />\nof all the socially helpful, The<br />\nBeastie Boys.<br />\nThose aside, the Tournee of<br />\nAnimation is a treat for the<br />\nsenses, a discount pass to over a<br />\ndozen bizarre universes of the imagination. Most of it is really funny. Some of it can teach you<br />\nthings, and all of it is stunning to<br />\nwatch. So you should all pull<br />\nyourselves away from the tube<br />\nthis weekend and go.

The<br />\ntheater, orginally owned by<br />\nLoyola College, was bought from<br />\nthe Jesuits by the city, and later<br />\nby Center Stage.<br />\nUntil recently, the only utilized production space was the<br />\ndownstairs, which houses the<br />\nPearlstone Theater.

In the past,<br />\nCenter Theater productions have<br />\nincluded such names as E.G.<br />\nMarshall, Megan Callagher(of<br />\nTV's \"China Beach\") and F.<br />\nMurray Abraham.<br />\nThe 1990-1991 season will<br />\nmark a dramatic change in Center<br />\nStage's potential. The renovation<br />\nof the Upstairs Theater, which<br />\nbegan a year ago this month, not<br />\nonly creates new usable space but<br />\na theater with a flexibility seldom<br />\nfound in larger venues.<br />\nThe Upstairs Theater, which<br />\nwill be unveiled with \"The<br />\nHeliotrope Bouquet by Scott<br />\nJoplin and Louis Chauvin,\" a<br />\nplay by Eric Overmeyer, was a<br />\n4.8 million dollar renovation project. The room was in fact the<br />\noriginal theater used by the<br />\nJusuits, and remnants of the<br />\nbackdrop painting can still be<br />\nseen on the brick walls.<br />\nOne of the most innovative<br />\nideas behind this project is the<br /><br />\nconcept of flexible seating<br />\ntowers. Among possible configurations are the arena theater<br />\nor theater in the round, as well\u2022<br />\nas proscenium theater. In fact,<br />\nexplains Yasinow, virtually any<br />\ndesired staging can be accommodated with this new theater.<br />\nYasinow noted that although<br />\none might assume that the<br />\nUpstairs Theater would be used<br />\nfor the more experimental and<br />\navant-garde theatrical productions, this was not the case.<br />\n\"It's really up to the director,\"<br />\nshe explained. 'One theater or the<br />\nother can be chosen to complement the production.\"<br />\nDepending on staging particulars, the Upstairs Theater will be<br />\ndesigned to hold 100-400 people.<br />\nLarge beams that run the length<br />\nof the ceiling will allow directors<br />\nto \"fly\" scenery from one part of<br />\nthe theater to the other, and a<br />\nlarge \"trap\" or \"pit\" is being<br />\ndesigned to allow things to be<br />\nbrought into the theater through<br />\nthe floor.<br />\nIn addition to the new theater,<br /><br />\nFood for Thought:<br /><br />\nThai to Find a Decent Dinner<br />\nby Jessica Maxwell<br />\nIf the newness of Terrace<br />\nRoom cuisine has worn off and<br />\nthe novelty of cooking (and cleaning up after cooking) in your very<br />\nown apartment has become a<br />\nHurculean labor, perhaps you<br />\nshould consider eating out.

The menu<br />\nis filled with dinner options: there<br />\nare six appetizers, six soups, two<br />\nsalads, and more than forty possible entrees.<br />\nDepending on your appetite<br />\nand how much money you're<br />\nwilling to spend, I recommend<br /><br />\nthe Kiew Krob ($3.95) as a<br />\nstarter. Kiew Krob is a Thai-style<br />\nfried won ton served with a<br />\nsweet, spicy red sauce. One order<br />\nis sufficent to split between two<br />\npeople.

Also in progress<br />\nis the transformation of a room<br />\nused by the Jesuits for a chapel<br />\ninto a bar for theatergoers.<br />\nAccording to Yasinow, the<br />\nrenovation of the Upstairs<br />\nTheater increases not only the<br />\ntheater's possibilities, but also<br /><br />\n700 N.

I was a bit hesitant to try this entree with squid,<br />\nbut I was pleasantly surprised.<br />\nEach of these entrees is served<br />\nwith a cup of steamed rice, but<br />\nyou may want to ask for extra rice<br />\nwhen you order.<br />\nAfter dinner, there are several<br />\nchoices for desserts ranging from<br />\n$1.50 to $2.00. I recommend the<br />\ncustard, but if the Thai dessert of<br /><br />\nthe day is Kanum Tuy, this<br />\ndessert cake made with coconut<br />\nmilk is also something you may<br />\nwant to try.<br />\nThe major drawback to the<br />\nThai Restaurant is that no one<br />\nwho works there has a specific<br />\nduty.

They are a part of<br />\na campus wide recycling program<br />\ninitiated by the Students for Environmental Action, in a joint effort with Plant Operations. In effect since last semester, the program represents the efforts of<br />\nSEA after only one year on campus as a student group. The group<br />\ntakes recyclable trash to recycling centers in the interest of a<br /><br />\ncleaner and safer environment.<br />\nSpecially-labelled containers<br />\nfor aluminum cans, glass, tin, and<br />\nwhite paper have been placed in<br />\nvirtually every building on campus. (There are plans to place<br />\ncontainers in off-campus living<br />\nfacilities in the near future.) In an<br />\nagreement between the school<br />\nand SEA,the school pays for the<br />\ncost of the containers.<br />\nJanitors empty all recyclable<br />\ntrash into several central locations. The SEA then picks up all<br />\nof the recyclable trash from<br /><br />\nvarious \"pickup points\" agreed<br />\nupon with custodial services and<br />\ntakes the trash to a 1000 pound<br />\ncapacity trailer, donated by Alcoa<br />\nAluminum Company. From the<br />\ntrailer on campus, SEA takes the<br />\nrecyclable trash to the appropriate<br />\nrecycling centers. White paper<br />\nand glass bottles are taken to<br />\nModern Junk and Salvage, while<br />\naluminum cans are sold to Alcoa<br />\nAluminum.<br />\nApproximately 230 pounds of<br />\naluminum and 1000 pounds of<br />\nglass are recycled each week. According to SEA President David<br />\nPyles, twenty percent of the<br />\nuniversity's waste is being recycled. The SEA's goal is to recycle<br />\n50 percent of the school's waste.<br />\nIf this were accomplished, the<br />\nschool would save between ten<br />\nand fifteen thousand dollars on<br />\ndisposal fees. Currently, all the<br />\nmoney received from the various<br /><br />\nApproximately<br />\n230 pounds of<br />\naluminum and 1000<br />\npounds of glass<br />\nare recycled<br />\neach week<br /><br />\nII<br /><br />\nrecycling centers goes toward the<br />\ncustodial services budget.<br />\nEd Warns, Director of Plant<br />\nOperations, noted that it costs 40<br />\ndollars a ton\u2022to remove garbage<br />\nthrough,a commercial waste company. Therefore, by recycling,<br />\nthe school not only receives<br />\nmoney for recyclables, but saves<br />\non waste disposal as well.<br /><br />\nBiendan Kruk<br /><br />\nRing<br /><br />\nThe SEA is working on a program to recycle plastics. This<br />\nprogram has been more difficult<br />\nto implement because the first<br />\nplastic recycling center in<br />\nMaryland opened only a few<br /><br />\nBrendan Kruk<br /><br />\nSEA Members Andy Cash and Tim Gullies collect recyclables for later transport to recycling centers off<br />\ncampus; at left, Cash deposits a load of aluminum cans onto a collection vehicle in front of Whitehead Hall.<br />\nmonths ago.<br />\nWhen asked about plans for a<br />\ncardboard recycling program,<br />\nWarns said that it would not be<br />\nfeasible. Not only would storage<br />\nspace be a problem, but it would<br />\ncost around 120 dollars per load<br />\nfor removal.<br />\nWarns expressed a positive<br />\nreaction to the program coordinated with SEA: \"Overall, we<br />\nhave had good cooperation from<br />\nboth the students and the<br />\nemployees.\" He went on to note<br />\nthat there has been only one<br />\ncomplaint\u2014from a person who<br />\nfelt the open soda cans were attracting bees.

In both<br />\nweeks we've had a chance to win<br />\nor a chance to tie, which is a<br />\npositive thing after a couple of<br />\ntough seasons. The negative thing<br />\nis obviously not winning.\"<br />\nWhile the Blue Jay defense<br />\nplayed very well in the first<br />\nquarter, the offense was nothing<br />\nshort of atrocious. Their first<br />\nthree series totalled -40 yards<br />\nand was followed by two successive fumbles. The second<br />\nmiscue occured deep in Blue Jay<br />\nterritory and led to Swarthmore's<br />\nfirst score.

We've got to eliminate<br />\nthose things to be competitive,\"<br />\nMargraff noted.<br />\nThose mistakes made starting<br />\nquarterback John Guglielmo a<br />\nproverbial sitting duck. He was<br />\nsacked four times in the first<br />\nquarter and had to throw two<br />\npasses away to avoid the rush. By<br />\nthe beginning of the second<br />\nquarter, Margraff had called on<br />\nScott Cade to replace Guglielmo.<br />\n\"I told the team the first<br />\nquarter was horrendous. Is it<br />\nJohn's fault? No. We dropped a<br />\npass on him, we were holding and<br />\nwe put him in bad situations,\"<br />\nMargraff said. \"We just had to<br />\nchange something. Do you<br />\nchange your left tackle or your<br />\nsplit end in that situation? No.<br />\nWhether it's right or wrong it's<br />\nmy decision.\"<br />\nFollowing Swartlunore's initial<br />\nscore, Margraffs decision was<br />\nproven right.

We only ask<br />\nthat we return enlightened;<br />\nthat we might humbly<br />\nunderstand why men and<br />\nwomen realize the wise Dierdorfian proverb and remain<br />\non the sidelines.<br />\nAlthough I surveyed the<br />\nNFL's ample list of walking<br />\nwounded from Week 1, this<br />\nweek's injury once again<br />\ncomes from my trusty bible<br />\nof sports medicine. It is the<br />\nstress fracture, the injury<br />\nwhich strikes fear into the<br /><br />\nhearts of the seven-footers in<br />\nour audience (of which we<br />\nknow there are many). The<br />\nintriguing thing about the<br />\nstress fracture is that it, has<br />\nnothing to do with exams,<br />\ncaffeine, infrequent sex, or<br />\nyoga. A stress fracture is<br />\nwhat a shin splint should be,<br />\na slight crack in the surface<br />\nof the bone which is often<br />\nundetectable by X-ray. The<br />\nareas which are most susceptible to stress fractures are<br />\nthe hands, feet, and legs.<br />\nAnd while your doctor may<br />\nnot be able to see it, you sure<br />\nknow it's there: they tell me<br />\nit hurts like hell. My advice<br />\nto someone with a stress fracture is to avoid any activity<br />\nwhich will extend the crack;<br />\nswimming is your safest bet.<br />\nBut why should you listen to<br />\nme? I don't know squat about<br />\nsports medicine.<br />\nJoin me next week when<br />\nThe Injury of the Week hits<br />\nthe streets to examine the injuries which strike closest to<br />\nhome: those within the<br />\nHopkins community.<br /><br />\nJays Home<br />\nHOME, from 14<br />\nin a short yardage defense.

The return reflected the<br />\nBlue Jays' only bright spot,<br />\nnamely the special teams. On the<br />\ngame's stat sheet it recorded<br />\nHopkins ahead of Swarthmore in<br />\nevery special team category. A<br />\nsmall bright spot, granted, but a<br />\nbright spot nevertheless.<br />\nDespite the poor play, the Jays<br />\nonly last by a touchdown.

As<br />\nMargraff said,\"We can't wait to<br />\nbe 'Back in Black'.\"<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Shotokan<br />\nKarate Club, currently in its 16th<br />\nyear, is making preparations for<br />\nthe East Coast Goodwill Tournament, September 30th, in Pennsylvania. The next competition<br />\nwill be the first of this season's<br />\nfive East Coast Collegiate Karate<br />\nUnion's Tournaments, to be held<br />\nin the Athletic Center from<br />\n12-5:00 p.m. October 27, the<br />\nSaturday of Parents' Weekend.<br />\nThis will be the first home tournament since 1984, and the club<br />\nexpects large participation from<br />\nits estimated 60 regular members.<br />\nThe team expects to host roughly<br />\neight other teams from such<br />\nuniversities as Yale, University of<br />\nPennsylvania, Drexel, Temple,<br />\nUniversity of New Hampshire,<br />\nand University of Massachusetts.<br />\nThe tournament will open with an<br />\nadvanced level demonstration to<br />\nbe followed by both individual<br />\nand team competition at the<br />\nbeginner, intermediate, and advanced levels in both Kumite<br />\n(sparring) and Kata (forms). Last<br />\nyear, the Johns Hopkins Team<br />\ntook fourth place in Kata and fifth<br />\nin Kumite for the East Coast.<br />\nFive members were invited to attend the National Collegiate<br />\nKarate Assosication's National<br />\nChampionship in November at<br />\nDenver, Colorado, the winners<br />\nfrom which will compete in<br />\nJapan.<br />\nAttendance at weekly classes in<br /><br />\naddition to team practices<br />\nprepares team members for the<br />\nspecific requirements of tournament competition through application of more advanced<br />\ntechniques. During class, basic<br />\nself defense karate skills such as<br />\nkicks, punches, and blocks are<br />\nstressed. Atter warming up, class<br />\nconsists of basic drills, and progresses into sparring. Then forms<br />\nare practiced. After practicing for<br />\nseveral weeks, these awkward<br />\nmovements develop into more<br />\nautomatic and spontaneous reactions. Following several months<br />\nof training the students, having<br />\nbecome rather skilled at self<br /><br />\ndefense, are prepared to take belt<br />\nexaminations, which evaluate individual progress.<br />\nIn addition to the obvious<br />\nbenefits of physical conditioning<br />\nand self defense, the study of<br />\nKarate Do teaches humility, self<br />\ndiscipline, and mental concentration. These characteristics are exemplified in the following tenets,<br />\nwhich the students strive to attain<br />\nand repeat at the end of each<br />\nclass: \"Seek perfection of<br />\ncharacter, Be faithful, Endeavor,<br />\nRespect others, and Refrain from<br />\nviolent behavior.\" Classes meet<br />\nthree times a week, Tuesdays and<br /><br />\nAdam Clark<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Calendar<br /><br />\nBIA Notes<br /><br />\n(9/21 - 9/27)<br />\nFairleigh-Dickinson<br /><br />\n7:30 pm<br /><br />\nSat. 9/22<br />\nTue. 9/25<br /><br />\nHaverford<br />\nYork<br /><br />\n2:00 pm<br />\n7:00 pm<br /><br />\nWomen's Soccer<br /><br />\nSat. 9/22<br />\nMon. 9/24<br />\nThur. 9/27<br /><br />\nMt.

It is unlikely only<br />\nbecause this is the year of the<br />\nCougars and the Cavaliers<br />\n(\"Who?\" you're asking).<br />\nBYU has the best player in<br />\nthe country, quarterback Ty<br />\nDetmer, and a wonderfully<br />\ncreampuffy schedule. While<br />\nNotre Dame, Miami, FSU,<br />\nand Auburn face the top teams<br />\nin the land (including each<br />\nother), BYU faces pushovers<br />\nlike New Mexico and Colorado State. So long as the<br />\nCougars continue to win (and<br />\nthey should), they could be national champions without being tested again. Virginia<br />\nposesses the best passing<br />\ntandem in the nation, Shawn<br />\nand Herman Moore (no relation), and only a slightly less<br />\nridiculous upcoming slate of<br />\ngames than BYU's.

Soon after<br />\nthe first goal was scored by<br />\nfreshman Marijayne Bushley,<br />\nGettysburg answered with a goal.<br />\n\"After our goal we started playing poorly, but then right before<br />\nthe half we started playing better<br />\nagain.

As the<br />\nnew fall season sets in (heralded by \"Cop Rock\" of<br />\nall things, alas), so changes the world of the Quiz. As<br />\nof now, the fate of the back page of the News-Letter<br />\nis in my hands. [Insert evil laugh here.] Now that that<br />\nis out of the way, grab a pencil, pen or crayon (don't<br />\nlaugh . . .by second semester you may be using them)<br />\nand prepare to hurt your brain on the quiz that I didn't<br />\nhave to call, but did, the \"Who Killed Laura Palmer?\"<br />\nQuiz<br />\nNow, how many of you out there want to know who<br />\nkilled Laura Palmer?
