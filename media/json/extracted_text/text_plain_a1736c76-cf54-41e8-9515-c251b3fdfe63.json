The exhibit<br />\nin the Civic Center was<br />\ndeveloped by the Soviet<br />\nWomen's Committee of the<br />\nUSSR. Zarubina said it was<br />\nstimulated by an international<br />\nconference on women's<br />\nproblems in Mexico in 1975,<br />\nwhere it became clear that<br />\nwomen from different countries<br />\ndid not know enough about each<br />\nother's concerns and problems.<br />\nThe exhibit, which will tour this<br />\ncountry, describes the Soviet<br />\nwoman's world in ways designed<br />\nto achieve a better<br />\nunderstanding between<br />\nAmericans and Soviets.<br />\nZarubina associates the<br />\nfreedom of Soviet women with<br />\nthe conquest of the Bolsheviks<br />\nin 1917, saying, \"From the<br />\noutset of the revolution, women<br />\n<br />\nshared in everything.\" The<br />\nSoviet Constitution flatly states:<br />\n\"Women are equal to Men.\"<br />\nZarubina says the Soviet<br />\ngovernment encourages women<br />\nto pursue the same types of<br />\ncareers that men do. Women<br />\ncomprise 80% of the doctors and<br />\n33% of the engineers and<br />\nlawyers within the USSR.<br />\nHowever, women are barred<br />\nfrom jobs that are \"hazardous to<br />\nfemale health.\" Also, women,<br />\nunlike men, are not required to<br />\nwork, and some whose husbands<br />\nare economically well-off<br />\nbecome housewives.<br />\nChildbearing has little effect<br />\non a Soviet woman's career.<br />\nAfter having a baby, a woman<br />\ncan leave work for four months<br />\nwhile receiving full pay, and she<br />\ncan stay off the job with no pay<br />\nfor up to a year. After this<br />\nperiod she returns to the same<br />\nposition she left. Working<br />\nmothers leave their children in<br />\nstate-supported day-care centers<br />\nduring the working day.<br />\nZarubina stresses that these<br />\ncenters \"help women take part<br />\nin society and work.\"<br />\nThough Soviet women have<br />\nachieved equality in the job<br />\nmarket, Zarubina admitted that<br />\nthey are not yet completely<br />\nequal to men. She said that the<br />\ntypical attitude of a Russian<br />\nmale is \"1 want my wife to be<br />\nequal, but I want my dinner to<br />\nbe ready when I come home.\"<br />\nThus after a wife leaves her job<br />\nshe must buy food for dinner in<br />\nvarious small shops, go home<br />\n<br />\nand cook dinner, serve it, clean<br />\nthe dishes, and do other<br />\nhousework, while the husband<br />\nrelaxes. Therefore, many wives<br />\nhold what amounts to two jobs.<br />\nShe says this practice seems to<br />\nbe changing in the younger<br />\ngenerations, with husbands and<br />\nwives sharing housework more<br />\noften.<br />\nIn her talk, Zarubina was<br />\ncareful not to criticize America,<br />\nbut she did criticize the views of<br />\nthe USSR expressed by some<br />\nmembers of the audience. She<br />\nsaid it was not true that the<br />\nUSSR suppresses dissidence and<br />\nis undemocratic. She said<br />\nanyone can express disapproval<br />\nof any government policy within<br />\nthe USSR.

According to<br />\nBarr, Coxhill's music is \"in no<br />\nway restricted by our notions of<br />\ntonality and time.\" And who is<br />\nthis \"we,\" Stephen? As the rest<br />\nof the review makes obvious,<br />\npeople who know nothing about<br />\njazz.

Of<br />\ncourse he was improvising; solo<br />\nsaxophone concerts like his have<br />\nbeen commonplace in jazz for at<br />\nleast fifteen years. Then Barr<br />\nasks the stereotypical question<br />\nof the jazz-listening novice,<br />\n'Where's the melody?', and<br />\nincorrectly states Coxhill didn't<br />\nimprovise on recognizable tunes.<br />\nAs proff of this claim, the<br />\nreviewer mentions that Coxhill<br />\nannounced \"Somewhere Over<br />\nthe Rainbow\" and then didn't<br />\nplay it.

Salant said Shriver<br />\nHall cannot hold a large enough<br />\naudience to pay for a Steve<br />\nMartin (who commands $35,000<br />\na night) or a George Carlin<br />\n($17.000). \"We did think of<br />\nnames like that,\" Salant said,<br />\n\"but we were unable to get<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nThe list of comedians now<br />\nbeing considered includes David<br />\nSteinberg, Mel Brooks, Lily<br />\nTomlin, Dan Akroyd, Gilda<br />\nRadner and Chevy Chase.<br />\nThe budget for the Fair is<br />\nabout $70,000, a large portion<br />\nof which will be spent on<br />\nentertainment. As in the past,<br />\nthe Fair must break even. The<br />\nStudent Council gave the Fair<br />\nCommittee $3,000 in seed<br />\nmoney, but that sum must be<br />\npaid back. In other words, the<br />\nFair must raise about $70,000 if<br />\nit intends to spend that much.<br />\nAbout half of the Fair's<br />\nrevenues come from food sales<br />\nand 'arts and craft booth rentals.<br />\nTicket sales, advertising revenues<br />\nand profits from items sold at<br />\nthe Fair account for the rest of<br />\n<br />\nthe money raised.<br />\nThere will probably be no<br />\n\"adult\" rides at the Fair because<br />\nof administration opposition.<br />\n\"They allegedly attract the more<br />\nundesirable elements of the<br />\ncommunity,\" said Salant. \"I<br />\npersonally am in favor of the<br />\nrides. I believe they add a unique<br />\naspect to the Fair.''<br />\nNevertheless, because opinion on<br />\nthe subject is divided on the Fair<br />\nstaff, Salant will not try to<br />\nchange administration policy on<br />\nthis point.<br />\nMany plans are still being<br />\nmade, Salant stressed, and input<br />\nis welcome. A meeting is<br />\nscheduled for Tuesday, February<br />\n13in the dorm social lounge for<br />\nall those interested in working<br />\non Spring Fair.<br />\nSalant hopes that this year's<br />\nFair will be a \"student Fair.\" He<br />\nhas sent letters to faculty<br />\nmembers telling them dates of<br />\nthe Fair and asking them co<br />\ncooperate when they are<br />\nplanning their curricula.<br />\nThe Fair is scheduled for<br />\nApril 20, 21 and 22, the<br />\nweekend before the MCAT's. This<br />\navoids the scheduling of<br />\nconflicts for pre-meds caused by<br />\nlast year's Fair, which was<br />\nscheduled for the same weekend<br />\nthat the MCAT's were given.<br />\n<br />\nLeague, and each school' holds<br />\nseats on the Board of<br />\nTrustees.<br />\nThe resolution, approved 16<br />\nto 2 to 1, was prompted by an<br />\narticle which appeared in the<br />\nNovember 13 issue of New<br />\nYorker. Brookhaven had been<br />\ntrucking highly radioactive<br />\nby-products of its reactors to<br />\nAiken, S.C., where the article<br />\nsuggests they were used in the<br />\nmanufacture of nuclear<br />\nweapons. The route led through<br />\nNew York, though, and three<br />\nyears ago the city's Board of<br />\nHealth banned the shipments.<br />\nSurrounding communities<br />\nfollowed suit, so that today<br />\nBrookhaven is forced to store<br />\nthe wastes on-site in temporary<br />\nholding facilities.<br />\nCoincidentally, on January 20<br />\nthe Nuclear Regulatory<br />\nCommission withdrew official<br />\nendorsement of the conclusions<br />\nof the \"Reactor Safety Study,\"<br />\na report issued in 1975 which<br />\nestimated the chances of<br />\naccident with nuclear reactors as<br />\nminimal.

In<br />\naddition, representatives from<br />\nHopkins have been meeting with<br />\nrepresentatives from various city<br />\nagencies in an attempt to<br />\nformulate a comprehensive plan<br />\nfor improving overall safety in<br />\nthe neighborhood around<br />\nmedical institutions.<br />\n<br />\nWJHU<br />\n<br />\nactual risks are either greater or<br />\nless than those calculated, there<br />\nis now a high degree of<br />\nuncertainty about the safety of<br />\nnuclear reactors.<br />\nHopkins' two representatives<br />\nto the A.U.I. Board of Trustees<br />\nare Chairman Aihud Pevsner and<br />\nVice-Provost Zdanis of the<br />\nPhysics Department. Zdanis feels<br />\nthat the gains associated with<br />\nBrookhaven's nuclear reactors<br />\nfar outweigh the risks. \"The<br />\nexperimental work is absolutely<br />\nnecessary,\" he said of the<br />\nLaboratory's research, which<br />\nincludes study of the very<br />\nquestions of safety which<br />\nconcern the N.R.C. and the<br />\nStudent Council. Some effort<br />\nhas already been directed<br />\ntowards finding a safe means of<br />\ntransporting and disposing of<br />\nradioactive wastes, according to<br />\nZdanis. \"I think Brookhaven<br />\npeople are very sensitive to this<br />\nissue.\"<br />\nHe concedes that on-site<br />\nstorage at Brookhaven will no<br />\nlonger be possible in about,four<br />\nyears, but.maintains that an<br />\nalternative will be found. Zdanis<br />\n<br />\nsuggests that radioactive wastes<br />\ncan be buried under natural salt<br />\ndomes, or reconverted into fuel<br />\nin reprocessing plants. All<br />\nreprocessing plants in the United<br />\nStates have been closed down<br />\nfor fear that the plutonium they<br />\nproduce might be smuggled out<br />\nfor use in nuclear weapons.<br />\nFreshman S.C. Representative<br />\nStephen Richmond, author of<br />\nthe Council's statement, feels<br />\nBrookhaven should be forced to<br />\nfind a solution to the dilemma<br />\nof disposal before more<br />\nradioactive wastes are generated.<br />\nHe maintains that nuclear<br />\ntechnology must be abandoned<br />\nif those effort prove fruitless. \"I<br />\ndon't know whether they'll find<br />\nan answer,\" Richmond said.<br />\n\"There's no way in hell it's<br />\nworth the risk.\" As a high school<br />\nsenior in Newton, Mass.,<br />\nRichmond submitted a proposal<br />\nto the local Board of Aldermen<br />\nto require that shipments of<br />\nradioactive materialsthrough the<br />\ncity be issued special permits.<br />\nThe measure was enacted last<br />\nmonth.<br />\n<br />\nif they wish to carry the ads special meeting Saturday at 1<br />\nsimply return the completed p.m. in the Student Council<br />\ncontracts.

The ones<br />\nhere are also under a lot ofpressure.\"<br />\n- Dr. William Waldman, Medical Director<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Health Service<br />\n<br />\nBY ROBERT RIGGS<br />\nThe University Health Service.<br />\nlocated in the Brown Memorial<br />\nInfirmary behind the new<br />\ndorms, is one of the best fringe<br />\nbenefits that students and their<br />\ndependent families get while<br />\nthey are at Hopkins, although<br />\nmost of them aren't aware of it<br />\n.unless they need it. From 40 to<br />\n50 people receive some kind of<br />\nattention at the Infirmary every<br />\nday, and most are seen by<br />\ndoctors.<br />\nThey receive this care at no<br />\ncharge, a fact which has a critical<br />\nimpact on the quality and<br />\namount of health 'care that<br />\nyoung members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity actually obtain. As<br />\nDr. William Waldman, Medical<br />\nDirector of the Health Service,<br />\nputs it, \"People who are here<br />\nmay come to the clinic whereas<br />\nif they were not here they<br />\nwouldn't. The facility is free. If<br />\nyou were a 25 year-old who<br />\nworked at Bethlehem Steel and<br />\nhad a cold, you'd be unlikely to<br />\n<br />\npay $20 to go to a doctor.\"<br />\nThe Health Service really is a<br />\nservice, provided as part of the<br />\npackage you get when your<br />\ntuition is paid at the University.<br />\nThe clinic receives no portion of<br />\nthe fee paid by students on the<br />\nUniversity health insurance plan<br />\nwhich is mandatory for people<br />\nwith no outside medical<br />\ncoverage of their own. Rather, it<br />\nis funded by the Division of<br />\nStudent Services. Actually, the<br />\ncenter could collect payments<br />\nfor much of the work it<br />\nperforms from Blue Cross, but it<br />\ndoes not because such claims<br />\nwould result in a higher group<br />\nrate, which the University wishes<br />\nto avoid.<br />\nWhile the Infirmary has been<br />\noffering the same general type of<br />\nservices for a long time, the<br />\nquality of care it offers has<br />\nsteadily improved over the past<br />\nyear. The improvement is due I<br />\nprimarily to a whole new set of<br />\ndoctors who now staff the<br />\nInfirmary. Dr. Waldman, who is<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Health Service Nurse-Coordinator Joan Rehner<br />\n<br />\nCo-op Revamped<br />\nThe student-run Food Co-op,<br />\noperating under newly-revamped<br />\nprocedures, signed up 40 new<br />\nmembers last week. The co-op<br />\nuses comparative shopping to try<br />\nto bring wholesale food prices to<br />\nits members.<br />\nThe Co-op is run under the<br />\nauspices of the Student Council<br />\nand the direction of senior Andy<br />\nFox. Members must pay an<br />\ninitial $2 fee and volunteer their<br />\nservices to maintain the<br />\nprogram. Orders for vegetables,<br />\ncheeses, nuts, eggs and other dry<br />\ngoods are taken on Monday<br />\nmornings. Andy Pessen, the<br />\nCo-op's only paid worker,<br />\npurchases the items in bulk at<br />\nnearby wholesale prices. Co-op<br />\nmembers, working in shifts,<br />\nprepare the individual orders<br />\n<br />\nwhich are purchased from 3 to 7<br />\np.m. on Fridays. Pessen and Fox<br />\noversee the collection and<br />\ndistribution of the goods and<br />\npayments.<br />\nLast semester the Co-op<br />\nreceived some operating funds<br />\nfrom the Student Council, with<br />\nBruce Smith, Council<br />\nVice-President, aiding in the<br />\ndirection of the program.<br />\nAlthough no funds are expected<br />\nthis semester, Fox commented<br />\nthat the Council is providing<br />\nassistance with publicity and<br />\nfunneling new members to the<br />\nservice. Also, the Council may<br />\nallow the Co-op to use the SAC<br />\nvan. Lack of vehicles for<br />\ntransporting the food has been a<br />\nmajor problem in the past.<br />\n<br />\nThe bright decor of the Infirmary radiates a friendly atmosphere.<br />\nthe only holdover from last year and the kinds of relationships he other steps to improve the<br />\nat this time, admits that, can establish with them differ quality of the care available to<br />\n\"between this year and last year, vastly from what he is students.

Wasn't that Paul McCartney 's old<br />\ngroup?\"<br />\n--typical fifteen-year-old<br />\n<br />\nThe average college senior would have to strain his<br />\nmemory to recall the day, fifteen years ago this week,<br />\nwhen the Beatles made their first appearance on the Ed<br />\nSullivan Show. I was six years old at the time. I<br />\nremember, as if it were yesterday, playing in the alley<br />\nbehind our house and hearing some neighborhood kids<br />\nexcitedly announce that \"The Beatles\" were going to be<br />\non the Sullivan show that Sunday. The name was foreign<br />\nto me then. I deduced, employing tot logic, that the<br />\nBeatles were an acrobatic company from Europe. The<br />\nsound of the group's name convinced me of that. After<br />\nall, Ed Sullivan always seemed to be having acrobats on<br />\nhis show. That Sunday night in front of my family's<br />\nblack and white Zenith, I found out (along with any<br />\nother uninformed souls) that the Beatles were anything<br />\nbut a bunch of trapeze artists. And the rest, as they say,<br />\nis history.<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nJOHN: Well, it just grows out yer head.<br />\nQ: What's this about an annual illness, George?<br />\nGEORGE:Iget cancer every year.<br />\nQ: Why do you think you get more fan mad than<br />\nanyone else in the group?<br />\nRINGO: I dunno. Suppose it's because more people<br />\nwrite me.<br />\nQ: Do teenagers scream at you because they are, in<br />\neffect, revolting against their parents?<br />\nPAUL: They've been revolting for years.<br />\nIn early 1964, the US was still in a stupor over the<br />\nassassination of President Kennedy two months earlier.<br />\nThe signing of the Civil Rights Act was several months<br />\naway, and the Vietnam War was just beginning its long<br />\nrun on evening news telecasts across the nation.<br />\nCulturally, it,was as if the '50's had never ended. Two<br />\nmusical favorites were The Four Seasons and The Beach<br />\nBoys. When asked, \"How did you find America?\", the<br />\nstandard Beatle reply was,\"Turn left at Greenland.\" In a<br />\n1970 interview with Rolling Stone, John Lennon offered<br />\na more serious answer to that question. \"When we got<br />\nhere you were all walkin' around in fuckin' Bermuda<br />\nshorts with Boston crew cuts and stuff on your<br />\nteeth...The chicks looked like 1940's horses. There was<br />\nno conception of dress or any of that jazz. We just<br />\nthought what an ugly race, what an ugly race...\"<br />\nThe Beatles noticed one other thing, besides fashion<br />\nsense, conspicuously absent in America circa 1964: rock<br />\nand roll. This surprised them because, as Lennon put it,<br />\n\"We were coming to the land of its origin but nobody<br />\nwanted to know about it.\" Even black pop musicians<br />\nseemed to ignore the heritage of Chuck Berry, Fats<br />\nDomino, and Elvis Presley (a heritage on which the<br />\nBeatles had based their musical style). One of the closest<br />\nthings to '50's rock and roll during the lean years of the<br />\nearly '60's was the Beach Boys' \"Surfin' USA,\" which<br />\n\"borrowed\" its melody from Berry's \"Sweet Little<br />\nSixteen.\" It took four young men from a seaport town<br />\nin England to give rock and roll back to America.<br />\n<br />\nmother that George Harrison (\"the Beatle!\") had been at<br />\ntheir school that afternoon. According to this pair of<br />\nhysterical nymphets, Harrison had donned an overcoat<br />\nto conceal his identity. He had been spotted in the<br />\nschool cafeteria, where he had accidentally knocked a<br />\nbox of straws onto the floor. After picking up the<br />\nstraws, he left before anyone could grab him. Some<br />\ncapitalist-minded young lady immediately began selling<br />\nthe straws at a buck apiece. \"Me and Suzanne bought<br />\nthree each,\" one of the girls gushed victoriously, holding<br />\nthe precious souvenirs aloft. My mother laughed. I, on<br />\nthe other hand, was numbed by the thought that one of<br />\nthe Beatles had been a mere three blocks away that day.<br />\nSeveral years passed before I even started wondering<br />\nwhat a Beatle was doing at a Catholic girls' high school. I<br />\ncould never seem to find an explanation. Even before I<br />\nslid into my cynical late-adolescent years, I had<br />\nconcluded that the whole story, straws and all, was a<br />\nfabrication, a fatly tale. The person mistaken for George<br />\n<br />\nBEATLE<br />\n<br />\n\"The Beatles are a plot by the British ruling classes to<br />\ndistract' British youngsters from politics and bitter<br />\npondering over disgraced and shattered hopes.\"<br />\n-Pravda, 1964<br />\n<br />\n\"Psycho-politicians are using the Beatle music and<br />\nother innocuous rhythms to hypnotize American youth<br />\nand prepare them for future submission to subversive<br />\ncontrol...a part of a systematic plan geared to making a<br />\ngeneration of American youth mentally ill and<br />\nemotionally unstable.\"<br />\nMay be it's coincidence that very little before<br />\nFebruary 1964 stands out in my recollections of life. I'm<br />\nsure everything starting with Day One is safely stashed<br />\nwithin the file cabinet (or, to be more modern,<br />\ncomputer bank) of my subconscious. Maybe it's merely<br />\nluck that my first truly vivid memory is of that electric<br />\nquartet with the Edwardian suits and the bowl haircuts.<br />\nMaybe. But I seriously doubt it.<br />\nMillions of words have been written about the Beatles.<br />\nYet it seems unlikely that much damage would be done<br />\nif a few more are added, especially on such a landmark<br />\noccasion as the fifteenth anniversary of Beatlemamia.

What excuse do you have for your<br />\n<br />\n-from Communism, Hypnotism, and The Beatles<br />\nby David A. Noebel<br />\n<br />\nSixty-eight million people watched the Beatles on the<br />\nEd Sullivan Show on February 7,1964.(Reportedly, no<br />\ncrimes were committed by American teenagers during<br />\nthe hour this particular Sullivan program was on.) By the<br />\ntime the Beatles played Baltimore's Civic Center in<br />\nSeptember of that year, their grip on the globe's<br />\npopulace, and particularly on the minds of nubile<br />\nfemales, was as tight as the arrangement of \"Please<br />\nPlease Me,\" and getting tighter. Closer to home, in my<br />\nneighborhood a legend sprung out of the group's visit to<br />\nthe Monumental City (Baltimore was Monumental<br />\nbefore it attained Charm). On the day of the Beatles'<br />\nBaltimore concert, I was sitting in front of the television<br />\n(probably watching Pete the Pirate or Rocky and<br />\nBullwinkle) when I heard squeals and shouts coming<br />\nfrom outside. My mother and I went to investigate. We<br />\nfound the two teenage girls who lived a few doors down<br />\nfrom us breathlessly atttempting to explain to their<br />\n<br />\nREVIS<br />\n<br />\nby Patrick I<br />\nHarrison was probably a janitor or wayward delivery<br />\nman. Recently, however, I did a little third-rate detective<br />\nwork and discovered that the whole story, straws and all,<br />\nthe<br />\nwas indeed true and, in fact, documented in<br />\n,<br />\nreports<br />\nBaltimore newspapers. According to these<br />\nHarrison had expressed an interest in seeing what<br />\nvolunteered<br />\nAmerican schools were like.

With their collarless jackets,<br />\npointy Spanish boots, and mop tops, they were certainly<br />\nsomething new to look at. But even the parents who<br />\nhated the music and the long hair (\"long\" by the<br />\nstandards of those days) had to admit that these were<br />\nnot your typical teenage heart-throbs. These were four<br />\nwitty and intelligent young men. It's hard to imagine<br />\npop stars like Fabian or Frankie Avalon replying \"Count<br />\nthe money,\" when asked, \"What will you do when your<br />\npopularity subsides?\" The Beatles set a new style,<br />\nirreverent, self-deprecating, but completely<br />\nself-confident.

All over the world, young and<br />\nold staged protests, publicly burning Beatle albums and<br />\npictures. An editorial in a Texas newspaper urged,<br />\n\"Deport the Beatles...They are undesirables and enemy<br />\nagents to the Christian cause...As far as we're concerned,<br />\ntheir concept of entertainment sounds as though it was<br />\nconceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity...\" In<br />\nSouth Carolina, the Grand Dragon of the state's Ku Klux<br />\nKlan tied a Beatle record to a large wooden cross and<br />\nthen set it on fire.<br />\nLennon eventually made a public apology, explaining<br />\nthat his remarks had been taken out of context. \"But<br />\nI was lucky to be the second youngest of four<br />\nthe record burning.

An Austin judge<br />\nruled yes, but no last week in a case involving the First<br />\nAmendment rights of punk rock singers.<br />\nThe unusual legal question arose during an<br />\nengagement of the Huns, a punk rock group at a<br />\nUniversity of Texas-Austin area club. As lead singer Phil<br />\nTolstead was singing the song, \"Eat Death Scum,\" a<br />\nplainclothes policeman who was at the club investigating<br />\na noise complaint approached the stage.<br />\nTolstead began directing the song's lyrics \"I hate you\"<br />\nat the officer, Steven Bridgewater, while pointing at him.<br />\nBridgewater then attempted to handcuff Tolstead, who,<br />\nin turn, attempted to kiss him. A scuffle broke out,<br />\nmore policemen entered the club and assisted<br />\nBridgewater in arresting To!stead and four other bar<br />\npatrons.<br />\nAt the 12-hour trial, Judge Steve Russell did not<br />\ncondemn the lyrics themselves. \"Punk rock does enjoy<br />\nconstitutional protection, because the state may not<br />\ndecide what forms of art are legitimate,\" Russell ruled.<br />\nHowever, unlike the audience members who<br />\n\"consented\" to hear the abusive lyrics, Bridgewater was<br />\na \"non-consenting\" person, and thus the lyrics<br />\nconstituted assaultive behavior.<br />\nTolstead was found guilty of disorderly conduct and<br />\nfined $53.50, while a patron was fined $28.50. The<br />\nothers arrested were found not guilty.<br />\nHowever, a UT government professor doesn't agree<br />\nwith the judge, citing two similar Supreme Court cases<br />\nthat ruled contrary to Russell's decision.

As always, Wertmuller focuses on<br />\nthe political and sexual roles people<br />\nplay--Paulo is a Communist, while his<br />\nAmerican wife is a Feminist.

Though it played a few of<br />\nits hit songs, it wasted much time doing<br />\nguitar improvs and fancy drum work.<br />\nNone of this seemed to bother the crowd,<br />\nhowever, who had come to get rowdy.<br />\nEven the calming presence of Joni<br />\nMitchell or Joan Baez would have<br />\nprobably elicited the same response.<br />\nWhen, out of the blackness, Heart<br />\nscreamed, \"Are you ready for some rock<br />\nand roll?\", the crowd lit up and went<br />\nwild. Heart sensed the crowd's mood<br />\npretty quickly and played mostly<br />\nhard-hitting, heavy rhythm songs,<br />\nincluding Little Queen's \"Darkness,\"<br />\n\"Straight on For You,\" \"Magic Man,\"<br />\n\"Keep My Love Alive,\" \"Crazy on You,\"<br />\n\"Kick It out,\" and \"Barracuda.\"<br />\nTo ease the crowd's tension, Heart<br />\ntried to vary their act in mid-concert by<br />\nplaying some of their newer, softer, rriore<br />\nsophisticated numbers. In one, f Ann:,<br />\nplayed some exotic flute music as a<br />\nprelude to a muted \"Dog and Butterfly.\"<br />\nSister Nancy soloed on the guitar. But<br />\nafter a few softer numbers, Heart realized<br />\nthat the Baltimore crowd wanted to<br />\n\"kick it out\"--and reverted to their<br />\nrowdier style. Heart did three<br />\nencores--one of their own, Led Zeppelin's<br />\n\"Rock and Roll,\" and Bread's \"Can't<br />\n'Live Without You.\"<br />\nHeart's theatrical fireworks matched its<br />\nmusical ones. After opening with an<br />\nexplosion of red firecrackers, Heart<br />\ninterspersed the concert with orange<br />\nflashes and rushes of red, purple, and<br />\norange dry ice. Similarly colored<br />\nspotlights also brightened the stage. But<br />\ndespite Heart's flashy special effects, the<br />\nstage was uncluttered and<br />\nsimple--allowing the Wilson sisters plenty<br />\nof leg room for kicking, spinning, and<br />\njumping.<br />\n<br />\nThough Heart has gained its enormous<br />\npopularity only in the past few years, the<br />\ngroup, in an early form, has existed for<br />\nmore than a decade. In 1967, Heart was<br />\nan all-male rock band playing the<br />\nSeattle/Vancouver bar circuit. Three<br />\nyears later, Ann Wilson moved in with<br />\none of the band members and began to<br />\nconvert Heart into today's nationally<br />\npopular group. Her sister, Nancy, also<br />\nmoved in with a band member and joined<br />\nthe group in 1974. Originally 01-male,<br />\nHeart is now composed of two women<br />\nwith an all-male band.<br />\nBecause its two-woman retinue is<br />\nunique in the rock business, Heart has<br />\npicked up the reputation of substituting<br />\nsex for talent. That may be possible to<br />\nbelieve when hearing the group on the<br />\nradio, but impossible to swallow after<br />\nattending a concert. Ann Wilson, the lead<br />\nvocalist, has a powerful stage presence<br />\napparent in her voice, and body<br />\nmovements. Yet it is not sex that she<br />\ntransmits on -stage; it is power. Though<br />\nthe crowd hooted and whistled when Ann<br />\nfaced the band and wiggled her behind, it<br />\nresponded much more potently to her<br />\nelectric-flute-like moan as she knelt in<br />\ncross spotlights after \"Magic Man.\" The<br />\ncrowd imitated Ann and Nancy's<br />\nfist-in-the-air, vertical body movements.<br />\nHeart seems to be becoming more and<br />\nmore \"Annie's band.\" Though Nancy<br />\nplays a good acoustic guitar, Ann<br />\ndominates the group with her powerful<br />\npresence. Nancy blends in as one of the<br />\nguys.<br />\nAt least half of any good concert is the<br />\ncrowd. This one, though fairly diverse<br />\nrespecting age and dress, had one thing in<br />\ncommon: they were all rowdy and<br />\nsmashed. A battalion of off-duty Marines,<br />\ncomfortably out of it at the beginning of<br />\nthe concert, was not only out of it<br />\nmentally but also physically by the end.<br />\nSeveral tripped down the stairs. Others<br />\nlay sprawled in the aisles and the<br />\nbathrooms. There were also a lot of<br />\nwasted high school-age kids, hair slicked<br />\nback or winged (depending on sex),<br />\nwearing jeans and vacuous expressions.<br />\n<br />\n11MCCI<br />\nTwo sets of Bobbsey Twins attended--a<br />\npair of girls wearing creamy silk blouses<br />\nand leather boots and a pair of guys in<br />\nmatching flannel shirts. Probably the<br />\noddest character at the concert was a<br />\npony-tailed hippie with a patch over his<br />\neye who wasiescorting his three-year-old<br />\ndaughter. On the other extreme was a<br />\nclean-cut, thirtyish man (perhaps a CIA<br />\nagent) who said nothing during the entire<br />\nconcert and stared glumly at his rowdy<br />\nneighbors. And, finally, there were the<br />\nPCP flake-pushers.<br />\nThe crowd wasn't sure where it was<br />\nheaded when the concert ended. Heart<br />\nwas more certain about its future.

Last Saturday the<br />\ntop ranked Division III<br />\nswimmers faced 2nd ranked<br />\nKenyon College and came away<br />\nwith a stunning 68-43 victory.<br />\nAdded proof of the team's high<br />\nsuccess potential came<br />\nWednesday night in the Newton<br />\nH. White Athletic Center, as the<br />\nswimmers met and defeated the<br />\nExplorers of La-Salle College by<br />\na score of 66-47,improving their<br />\nrecord to six victories against<br />\nonly two losses.<br />\n\"The meet was what we<br />\n<br />\nexpected in terms of being a<br />\nclose, difficult, and unnerving<br />\ntype of contest,\" observed<br />\nsecond year Coach Tim Welsh.<br />\nWelsh added that he \"didn't<br />\nexpect the large lead\" the team<br />\nsucceeded in accumulating early<br />\nin the contest. The Blue Jays<br />\nbuilt up a 30-13 advantage<br />\nthrough the first five events(400<br />\nyd. Medley Relay, 1000 yd.<br />\nFreestyle, 200 yd. Freestyle, 50<br />\nyd.

There are many<br />\ndisorders that can be neutralized<br />\nby lots of vigorous exercise. As<br />\nexercise is increased,<br />\ndegenerative diseases of all kinds<br />\nare decreased, life-span is<br />\nextended, various minor<br />\ninfections such as colds are<br />\nreduced, and perhaps best of all,<br />\nthe quality of life is significantly<br />\nenhanced.<br />\nThe best exercise should be<br />\ncharacterized as \"vigorous<br />\nthough not violent.\" Jogging and<br />\nrunning are for the few. Most<br />\nindividuals do not maintain a<br />\nhigh enough level of athletic<br />\ntraining to make jogging or<br />\nrunning a safe exercise. For<br />\nthese individuals, walking and<br />\nuseful outdoor work will avoid<br />\nmany physical problems that can<br />\narise from violent<br />\n<br />\nexercise --painful joints,<br />\nligaments and muscles; excessive<br />\nmenstrual bleeding; headaches;<br />\nand chest pain are some of these<br />\nproblems.<br />\nCompetitive sports are not the<br />\nbest form of exercise. During<br />\nyouth and early adulthood,<br />\ncompetitive sports may be a<br />\nmajor form of exercise. At this<br />\nage, a fixed program is not<br />\nessential to induce one to<br />\nexercise. But, at about age 35,<br />\nwhen one really begins to need<br />\nthe exercise, both because of the<br />\nfixing of attention on other<br />\nmatters, and because the health<br />\nbegins to deteriorate at that age<br />\nif exercise is neglected, one<br />\nbegins to lose skills and interest<br />\nin competitive sports, and there<br />\ngoes his exercise.

Bill Smiddy,<br />\nbest in this event, was not<br />\nentered for strategic reasons.<br />\nInstead, all eyes turned to Jon<br />\nBlank and Dean Buchenauer.<br />\nCoach Welsh felt that \"Blank<br />\nwas the best swimmer entered in<br />\nthe event tonight. A one-two<br />\nplacing would have won the<br />\nmeet.\" Blank was disqualified,<br />\nhowever, for taking two false<br />\nstarts. Buchenauer not only won<br />\nthe event, but also qualified for<br />\nNationals, cruising through his<br />\neight laps with a time of 2:14.<br />\nNow the score was 54-43 and<br />\nattention was turned again to<br />\nMike DiCio, who this time<br />\nneeded a win to secure the Blue<br />\nJay victory. Adams of LaSalle<br />\nwas expected to give DiCio some<br />\ntrouble. \"It is important for<br />\nMike to have to dive under<br />\npressure,\" Coach Welsh<br />\nexplained. \"He is going to have<br />\nto defend his title in the 1 Meter<br />\nNationals.\" DiCio came through,<br />\nhowever, after executing some<br />\ndifficult dives and clinching the<br />\nvictory for the team.<br />\nIn the final event, Jon Blank,<br />\nKen Fishman, Bill Smiddy and<br />\nFran Florez captured the 400<br />\nyd.

Brookhaven had been<br />\ntrucking highly radioactive<br />\nby-products of its reactors to<br />\nAiken, S.C., where the article<br />\nsuggests they were used in the<br />\nmanufacture of nuclear<br />\nweapons. The route led through<br />\nNew York, though, and three<br />\nyears ago the city's Board of<br />\nHealth banned the shipments.<br />\nSurrounding communities<br />\nfollowed suit, so that today<br />\nBrookhaven is forced to store<br />\nthe wastes on-site in temporary<br />\nholding facilities.<br />\nCoincidentally, on January 20<br />\nthe Nuclear Regulatory<br />\nCommission withdrew official<br />\nendorsement of the conclusions<br />\nof the \"Reactor Safety Study,\"<br />\na report issued in 1975 which<br />\nestimated the chances of<br />\naccident with nuclear reactors as<br />\nminimal.

Board of Trustees<br />\nare Chairman Aihud Pevsner and<br />\nVice-Provost Zdanis of the<br />\nPhysics Department. Zdanis feels<br />\nthat the gains associated with<br />\nBrookhaven's nuclear reactors<br />\nfar outweigh the risks. \"The<br />\nexperimental work is absolutely<br />\nnecessary,\" he said of the<br />\nLaboratory's research, which<br />\nincludes study of the very<br />\nquestions of safety which<br />\nconcern the N.R.C. and the<br />\nStudent Council. Some effort<br />\nhas already been directed<br />\ntowards finding a safe means of<br />\ntransporting and disposing of<br />\nradioactive wastes, according to<br />\nZdanis. \"I think Brookhaven<br />\npeople are very sensitive to this<br />\nissue.\"<br />\nHe concedes that on-site<br />\nstorage at Brookhaven will no<br />\nlonger be possible in about,four<br />\nyears, but.maintains that an<br />\nalternative will be found. Zdanis<br /><br />\nsuggests that radioactive wastes<br />\ncan be buried under natural salt<br />\ndomes, or reconverted into fuel<br />\nin reprocessing plants.

The ones<br />\nhere are also under a lot ofpressure.\"<br />\n- Dr. William Waldman, Medical Director<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Health Service<br /><br />\nBY ROBERT RIGGS<br />\nThe University Health Service.<br />\nlocated in the Brown Memorial<br />\nInfirmary behind the new<br />\ndorms, is one of the best fringe<br />\nbenefits that students and their<br />\ndependent families get while<br />\nthey are at Hopkins, although<br />\nmost of them aren't aware of it<br />\n.unless they need it. From 40 to<br />\n50 people receive some kind of<br />\nattention at the Infirmary every<br />\nday, and most are seen by<br />\ndoctors.<br />\nThey receive this care at no<br />\ncharge, a fact which has a critical<br />\nimpact on the quality and<br />\namount of health 'care that<br />\nyoung members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity actually obtain. As<br />\nDr. William Waldman, Medical<br />\nDirector of the Health Service,<br />\nputs it, \"People who are here<br />\nmay come to the clinic whereas<br />\nif they were not here they<br />\nwouldn't. The facility is free. If<br />\nyou were a 25 year-old who<br />\nworked at Bethlehem Steel and<br />\nhad a cold, you'd be unlikely to<br /><br />\npay $20 to go to a doctor.\"<br />\nThe Health Service really is a<br />\nservice, provided as part of the<br />\npackage you get when your<br />\ntuition is paid at the University.<br />\nThe clinic receives no portion of<br />\nthe fee paid by students on the<br />\nUniversity health insurance plan<br />\nwhich is mandatory for people<br />\nwith no outside medical<br />\ncoverage of their own. Rather, it<br />\nis funded by the Division of<br />\nStudent Services. Actually, the<br />\ncenter could collect payments<br />\nfor much of the work it<br />\nperforms from Blue Cross, but it<br />\ndoes not because such claims<br />\nwould result in a higher group<br />\nrate, which the University wishes<br />\nto avoid.<br />\nWhile the Infirmary has been<br />\noffering the same general type of<br />\nservices for a long time, the<br />\nquality of care it offers has<br />\nsteadily improved over the past<br />\nyear. The improvement is due I<br />\nprimarily to a whole new set of<br />\ndoctors who now staff the<br />\nInfirmary. Dr. Waldman, who is<br /><br />\n\u2022 Health Service Nurse-Coordinator Joan Rehner<br /><br />\nCo-op Revamped<br />\nThe student-run Food Co-op,<br />\noperating under newly-revamped<br />\nprocedures, signed up 40 new<br />\nmembers last week. The co-op<br />\nuses comparative shopping to try<br />\nto bring wholesale food prices to<br />\nits members.<br />\nThe Co-op is run under the<br />\nauspices of the Student Council<br />\nand the direction of senior Andy<br />\nFox. Members must pay an<br />\ninitial $2 fee and volunteer their<br />\nservices to maintain the<br />\nprogram. Orders for vegetables,<br />\ncheeses, nuts, eggs and other dry<br />\ngoods are taken on Monday<br />\nmornings. Andy Pessen, the<br />\nCo-op's only paid worker,<br />\npurchases the items in bulk at<br />\nnearby wholesale prices. Co-op<br />\nmembers, working in shifts,<br />\nprepare the individual orders<br /><br />\nwhich are purchased from 3 to 7<br />\np.m. on Fridays. Pessen and Fox<br />\noversee the collection and<br />\ndistribution of the goods and<br />\npayments.<br />\nLast semester the Co-op<br />\nreceived some operating funds<br />\nfrom the Student Council, with<br />\nBruce Smith, Council<br />\nVice-President, aiding in the<br />\ndirection of the program.<br />\nAlthough no funds are expected<br />\nthis semester, Fox commented<br />\nthat the Council is providing<br />\nassistance with publicity and<br />\nfunneling new members to the<br />\nservice. Also, the Council may<br />\nallow the Co-op to use the SAC<br />\nvan. Lack of vehicles for<br />\ntransporting the food has been a<br />\nmajor problem in the past.<br /><br />\nThe bright decor of the Infirmary radiates a friendly atmosphere.<br />\nthe only holdover from last year and the kinds of relationships he other steps to improve the<br />\nat this time, admits that, can establish with them differ quality of the care available to<br />\n\"between this year and last year, vastly from what he is students.

Wasn't that Paul McCartney 's old<br />\ngroup?\"<br />\n--typical fifteen-year-old<br /><br />\nThe average college senior would have to strain his<br />\nmemory to recall the day, fifteen years ago this week,<br />\nwhen the Beatles made their first appearance on the Ed<br />\nSullivan Show. I was six years old at the time. I<br />\nremember, as if it were yesterday, playing in the alley<br />\nbehind our house and hearing some neighborhood kids<br />\nexcitedly announce that \"The Beatles\" were going to be<br />\non the Sullivan show that Sunday. The name was foreign<br />\nto me then. I deduced, employing tot logic, that the<br />\nBeatles were an acrobatic company from Europe. The<br />\nsound of the group's name convinced me of that. After<br />\nall, Ed Sullivan always seemed to be having acrobats on<br />\nhis show. That Sunday night in front of my family's<br />\nblack and white Zenith, I found out (along with any<br />\nother uninformed souls) that the Beatles were anything<br />\nbut a bunch of trapeze artists. And the rest, as they say,<br />\nis history.<br />\nV<br /><br />\nJOHN: Well, it just grows out yer head.<br />\nQ: What's this about an annual illness, George?<br />\nGEORGE:Iget cancer every year.<br />\nQ: Why do you think you get more fan mad than<br />\nanyone else in the group?<br />\nRINGO: I dunno. Suppose it's because more people<br />\nwrite me.<br />\nQ: Do teenagers scream at you because they are, in<br />\neffect, revolting against their parents?<br />\nPAUL: They've been revolting for years.<br />\nIn early 1964, the US was still in a stupor over the<br />\nassassination of President Kennedy two months earlier.<br />\nThe signing of the Civil Rights Act was several months<br />\naway, and the Vietnam War was just beginning its long<br />\nrun on evening news telecasts across the nation.<br />\nCulturally, it,was as if the '50's had never ended. Two<br />\nmusical favorites were The Four Seasons and The Beach<br />\nBoys. When asked, \"How did you find America?\", the<br />\nstandard Beatle reply was,\"Turn left at Greenland.\" In a<br />\n1970 interview with Rolling Stone, John Lennon offered<br />\na more serious answer to that question. \"When we got<br />\nhere you were all walkin' around in fuckin' Bermuda<br />\nshorts with Boston crew cuts and stuff on your<br />\nteeth...The chicks looked like 1940's horses. There was<br />\nno conception of dress or any of that jazz. We just<br />\nthought what an ugly race, what an ugly race...\"<br />\nThe Beatles noticed one other thing, besides fashion<br />\nsense, conspicuously absent in America circa 1964: rock<br />\nand roll. This surprised them because, as Lennon put it,<br />\n\"We were coming to the land of its origin but nobody<br />\nwanted to know about it.\" Even black pop musicians<br />\nseemed to ignore the heritage of Chuck Berry, Fats<br />\nDomino, and Elvis Presley (a heritage on which the<br />\nBeatles had based their musical style). One of the closest<br />\nthings to '50's rock and roll during the lean years of the<br />\nearly '60's was the Beach Boys' \"Surfin' USA,\" which<br />\n\"borrowed\" its melody from Berry's \"Sweet Little<br />\nSixteen.\" It took four young men from a seaport town<br />\nin England to give rock and roll back to America.<br /><br />\nmother that George Harrison (\"the Beatle!\") had been at<br />\ntheir school that afternoon. According to this pair of<br />\nhysterical nymphets, Harrison had donned an overcoat<br />\nto conceal his identity. He had been spotted in the<br />\nschool cafeteria, where he had accidentally knocked a<br />\nbox of straws onto the floor. After picking up the<br />\nstraws, he left before anyone could grab him. Some<br />\ncapitalist-minded young lady immediately began selling<br />\nthe straws at a buck apiece. \"Me and Suzanne bought<br />\nthree each,\" one of the girls gushed victoriously, holding<br />\nthe precious souvenirs aloft. My mother laughed. I, on<br />\nthe other hand, was numbed by the thought that one of<br />\nthe Beatles had been a mere three blocks away that day.<br />\nSeveral years passed before I even started wondering<br />\nwhat a Beatle was doing at a Catholic girls' high school. I<br />\ncould never seem to find an explanation. Even before I<br />\nslid into my cynical late-adolescent years, I had<br />\nconcluded that the whole story, straws and all, was a<br />\nfabrication, a fatly tale.

I'm<br />\nsure everything starting with Day One is safely stashed<br />\nwithin the file cabinet (or, to be more modern,<br />\ncomputer bank) of my subconscious.

What excuse do you have for your<br /><br />\n-from Communism, Hypnotism, and The Beatles<br />\nby David A. Noebel<br /><br />\nSixty-eight million people watched the Beatles on the<br />\nEd Sullivan Show on February 7,1964.(Reportedly, no<br />\ncrimes were committed by American teenagers during<br />\nthe hour this particular Sullivan program was on.) By the<br />\ntime the Beatles played Baltimore's Civic Center in<br />\nSeptember of that year, their grip on the globe's<br />\npopulace, and particularly on the minds of nubile<br />\nfemales, was as tight as the arrangement of \"Please<br />\nPlease Me,\" and getting tighter. Closer to home, in my<br />\nneighborhood a legend sprung out of the group's visit to<br />\nthe Monumental City (Baltimore was Monumental<br />\nbefore it attained Charm). On the day of the Beatles'<br />\nBaltimore concert, I was sitting in front of the television<br />\n(probably watching Pete the Pirate or Rocky and<br />\nBullwinkle) when I heard squeals and shouts coming<br />\nfrom outside.

All over the world, young and<br />\nold staged protests, publicly burning Beatle albums and<br />\npictures. An editorial in a Texas newspaper urged,<br />\n\"Deport the Beatles...They are undesirables and enemy<br />\nagents to the Christian cause...As far as we're concerned,<br />\ntheir concept of entertainment sounds as though it was<br />\nconceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity...\" In<br />\nSouth Carolina, the Grand Dragon of the state's Ku Klux<br />\nKlan tied a Beatle record to a large wooden cross and<br />\nthen set it on fire.<br />\nLennon eventually made a public apology, explaining<br />\nthat his remarks had been taken out of context. \"But<br />\nI was lucky to be the second youngest of four<br />\nthe record burning.

Y'see, I've been following the<br />\nguy ever since \"Journey to the Center of<br />\nYour Mind\" drilled a hole through my<br />\ncranium way back in '68, and if there's<br />\none thing that I can't stand, it's a<br />\nJohnny-come-lately bandwagon hopper.<br />\nIf you attend hard rock concerts<br />\nregularly, I'm sure you've noticed the<br />\nhordes of long-haired, red-eyed<br />\nadolescents decked out in their official<br />\nTed Nugent T-shirts and/or belt buckles.<br />\nAt the sight of this peculiar breed of<br />\nhomo sapien, I try to avoid gagging by<br />\nconvincing myself that if I were fourteen,<br />\nI'd probably look a lot like them. It<br />\nseldom works.<br />\nAnd it seems you can't go anywhere<br />\nthese days without seeing the word<br />\n\"Nugent\" scrawled across some kid's<br />\nnotebook. In fact, a recent survey of<br />\njunior high school males showed Ted<br />\noutdistancing the nearest competition,<br />\n\"Led Z,ep,\" by a two-to-one margin.<br />\n(Amazingly,\"The Ramones\" did not turn<br />\nup on a single notebook. Try to figure<br />\nthat out.)<br />\nSo, to separate the men from the boys,<br />\nthe cool from the uncool, and the true<br />\nGonzos from the goobers, I have devised<br />\na short, multiple-choice quiz that will<br />\nallow you to demonstrate your<br />\nknowledge of the man who has bagged<br /><br />\nthousands of wild animals ano even more<br />\ngroupies in his time.

As always, Wertmuller focuses on<br />\nthe political and sexual roles people<br />\nplay--Paulo is a Communist, while his<br />\nAmerican wife is a Feminist. Unlike<br />\nSwept Away and Love and Anarchy,<br />\nhowever, A Night Full ofRain misses the<br /><br />\nmark because it isn't convincing. The film<br />\nis thick with melodrama which simply<br />\ndoesn't translate into English without<br />\nsome embarrassment.<br />\nFor A Night Full of Rain, Daisy meets<br />\nPaulo in Italy. He follows, her to San<br />\nFrancisco, persuing her relentlessly until<br />\nshe submits (in the back seat of a<br />\nVolkswagen during a downpour). The<br />\nfact that Daisy detested Paulo and all his<br />\nideals is never truly reconciled.<br />\nNevertheless, they marry, they have a<br />\nchild, they fight. During these fights, and<br />\nsporadically throughout the film, a<br />\n\"chorus\" of friends narrates the scene,<br />\nmaking its thoughts, as well as those of<br />\nDaisy and Paulo, audible. These friends<br />\nare there, as one expained, \"to look at<br />\nthings from a distance--to analyze.\" They<br />\nare nightmarish remnants of a dying<br />\nsociety--peers and critics.<br />\nThe friends' presence is unrealistic and<br />\nunjustified Are they in the imagination of<br />\nDaisy and Paulo, or Wertmuller?Their<br />\ncomments are often trite and contrived.<br />\nSoon, the use of these friends becomes a<br />\nshort cut which leaves the audience<br />\nshortchanged.<br />\nThe friends' comments try to articulate<br />\nwhat is,essentially, Wertmuller's message.<br />\nThe technique fails, however, because'it is<br />\nover-obvious and melodramatic.<br />\nIn A Night Full of Rain, Lim<br />\nWertmuller takes a turn for the worse,<br />\nbut it's not a total loss. The<br />\nmusic--ranging from opera to jazz--is<br />\nexcellent, as is the cinematography. A<br />\nNight Full of Rain is a new direction for<br />\nWertmuller; an experiment that went<br />\nwrong.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 1.)<br /><br />\nHeart Kicks It Out Downtown<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\nSpearheaded by the dynamic Ann<br />\nWilson, hard-rocking Heart pumped<br />\nexcitement into the already hyped-up<br />\n,crowd at a packed Civic Center on<br />\nTuesday, January 30.<br />\nFirefall, the warm-up group, was<br />\ndisappointing.

In one, f Ann:,<br />\nplayed some exotic flute music as a<br />\nprelude to a muted \"Dog and Butterfly.\"<br />\nSister Nancy soloed on the guitar. But<br />\nafter a few softer numbers, Heart realized<br />\nthat the Baltimore crowd wanted to<br />\n\"kick it out\"--and reverted to their<br />\nrowdier style. Heart did three<br />\nencores--one of their own, Led Zeppelin's<br />\n\"Rock and Roll,\" and Bread's \"Can't<br />\n'Live Without You.\"<br />\nHeart's theatrical fireworks matched its<br />\nmusical ones. After opening with an<br />\nexplosion of red firecrackers, Heart<br />\ninterspersed the concert with orange<br />\nflashes and rushes of red, purple, and<br />\norange dry ice. Similarly colored<br />\nspotlights also brightened the stage. But<br />\ndespite Heart's flashy special effects, the<br />\nstage was uncluttered and<br />\nsimple--allowing the Wilson sisters plenty<br />\nof leg room for kicking, spinning, and<br />\njumping.<br /><br />\nThough Heart has gained its enormous<br />\npopularity only in the past few years, the<br />\ngroup, in an early form, has existed for<br />\nmore than a decade. In 1967, Heart was<br />\nan all-male rock band playing the<br />\nSeattle/Vancouver bar circuit. Three<br />\nyears later, Ann Wilson moved in with<br />\none of the band members and began to<br />\nconvert Heart into today's nationally<br />\npopular group. Her sister, Nancy, also<br />\nmoved in with a band member and joined<br />\nthe group in 1974. Originally 01-male,<br />\nHeart is now composed of two women<br />\nwith an all-male band.<br />\nBecause its two-woman retinue is<br />\nunique in the rock business, Heart has<br />\npicked up the reputation of substituting<br />\nsex for talent. That may be possible to<br />\nbelieve when hearing the group on the<br />\nradio, but impossible to swallow after<br />\nattending a concert. Ann Wilson, the lead<br />\nvocalist, has a powerful stage presence<br />\napparent in her voice, and body<br />\nmovements. Yet it is not sex that she<br />\ntransmits on -stage; it is power. Though<br />\nthe crowd hooted and whistled when Ann<br />\nfaced the band and wiggled her behind, it<br />\nresponded much more potently to her<br />\nelectric-flute-like moan as she knelt in<br />\ncross spotlights after \"Magic Man.\" The<br />\ncrowd imitated Ann and Nancy's<br />\nfist-in-the-air, vertical body movements.<br />\nHeart seems to be becoming more and<br />\nmore \"Annie's band.\" Though Nancy<br />\nplays a good acoustic guitar, Ann<br />\ndominates the group with her powerful<br />\npresence. Nancy blends in as one of the<br />\nguys.<br />\nAt least half of any good concert is the<br />\ncrowd. This one, though fairly diverse<br />\nrespecting age and dress, had one thing in<br />\ncommon: they were all rowdy and<br />\nsmashed. A battalion of off-duty Marines,<br />\ncomfortably out of it at the beginning of<br />\nthe concert, was not only out of it<br />\nmentally but also physically by the end.<br />\nSeveral tripped down the stairs. Others<br />\nlay sprawled in the aisles and the<br />\nbathrooms. There were also a lot of<br />\nwasted high school-age kids, hair slicked<br />\nback or winged (depending on sex),<br />\nwearing jeans and vacuous expressions.<br /><br />\n11MCCI<br />\nTwo sets of Bobbsey Twins attended--a<br />\npair of girls wearing creamy silk blouses<br />\nand leather boots and a pair of guys in<br />\nmatching flannel shirts. Probably the<br />\noddest character at the concert was a<br />\npony-tailed hippie with a patch over his<br />\neye who wasiescorting his three-year-old<br />\ndaughter. On the other extreme was a<br />\nclean-cut, thirtyish man (perhaps a CIA<br />\nagent) who said nothing during the entire<br />\nconcert and stared glumly at his rowdy<br />\nneighbors. And, finally, there were the<br />\nPCP flake-pushers.<br />\nThe crowd wasn't sure where it was<br />\nheaded when the concert ended. Heart<br />\nwas more certain about its future.

As<br />\nexercise is increased,<br />\ndegenerative diseases of all kinds<br />\nare decreased, life-span is<br />\nextended, various minor<br />\ninfections such as colds are<br />\nreduced, and perhaps best of all,<br />\nthe quality of life is significantly<br />\nenhanced.<br />\nThe best exercise should be<br />\ncharacterized as \"vigorous<br />\nthough not violent.\" Jogging and<br />\nrunning are for the few. Most<br />\nindividuals do not maintain a<br />\nhigh enough level of athletic<br />\ntraining to make jogging or<br />\nrunning a safe exercise. For<br />\nthese individuals, walking and<br />\nuseful outdoor work will avoid<br />\nmany physical problems that can<br />\narise from violent<br /><br />\nexercise --painful joints,<br />\nligaments and muscles; excessive<br />\nmenstrual bleeding; headaches;<br />\nand chest pain are some of these<br />\nproblems.<br />\nCompetitive sports are not the<br />\nbest form of exercise. During<br />\nyouth and early adulthood,<br />\ncompetitive sports may be a<br />\nmajor form of exercise. At this<br />\nage, a fixed program is not<br />\nessential to induce one to<br />\nexercise. But, at about age 35,<br />\nwhen one really begins to need<br />\nthe exercise, both because of the<br />\nfixing of attention on other<br />\nmatters, and because the health<br />\nbegins to deteriorate at that age<br />\nif exercise is neglected, one<br />\nbegins to lose skills and interest<br />\nin competitive sports, and there<br />\ngoes his exercise.
