John Adams, co-organizer of the Committee stated that such questions as transportation research<br />\nand social analysis are far more important than military<br />\nresearch in today's world where the quality of researchers<br />\nsuch as those at APL area.<br />\nJim Keogh indicated that a formal list of proposals<br />\nmust be formulated immediately \"because the issues<br />\nhave had enough exposure and the people need concrete<br />\nissues now.\" \"<br />\n<br />\n\"(Monistic Procedures\"<br />\n<br />\nJim Keogh, co-organizer of the Committee for APL, wants<br />\nto bypass the \"onanistic procedures\" of the University.<br />\n<br />\nOnce the Committee's proposals have been outlined,<br />\nthey will be presented directly to the Board of Trustees.<br />\n\"To go through the onanistic procedures(of the University)<br />\ncould only be an act of politeness to President Gordon,\"<br />\nsaid Keogh. \"And in view of Dr. Gordon's past service to<br />\nthe militaristic mandarins that we're so concerned with,<br />\nsuch difference is uncalled for.\"<br />\nKeogh explained that he feels Gordon tobe 'irrelevant'<br />\n<br />\nto the decision-making process at Hopkins. \"We're confident that the Board of Trustees wants to make up its<br />\nown mind.\"<br />\nIn addition to petitioning the Board of Trustees in hopes<br />\nof affecting some change in APL's research standards,<br />\nthe Committee will hold a petition compaign to rally student and faculty support. Keogh noted that they also will<br />\nseek support from state-wide groups, such as the Maryland Moratorium Committee and SANE.<br />\n<br />\nAreas Of Agreement<br />\nKeogh stated that this evening's meeting should \"represent a broad cross section of the University's community.\"<br />\nHe hopes to find what specific areas of agreement exist.<br />\nDespite uncertainities over the specific proposals which<br />\nwill emerge from this evenings meeting, Keogh expects<br />\na \"low-key\" campaign. \"That doesn't mean however that<br />\nwe want to get bogged down,\" he added.\"We're sure that<br />\nthe Trustees will listen to reason.\"<br />\nThe Committee will ask the Trustees to respond shortly<br />\nafter Easter. \"This will give them sufficient time to consider what we've said,\" he continued.<br />\nTo date, the workshops sponsored by the Committee<br />\nfor APL have been sporatically attenued. Nevertheless<br />\nKeogh has found them \"very useful.\" He has been in contact with people from the Applied Physics Laboratory in<br />\naddition to his Committee's work at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nThe Eclipse, Assateague, and Boy Scouts;<br />\nNature Triumphs Over the Pseudo-Scientist<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nFreaks and Boy Scouts alike gathered<br />\nin droves Saturday to view \"the eclipse<br />\nof the century\" which cut a swath of darkness up the eastern coast of the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nIn Maryland, the eclipse was total in<br />\nOcean City and on Assateague Island.<br />\nOther popular gathering spots for people<br />\nfrom the Baltimore area were the Virginia portion of Assateauge, and the<br />\ncoast south to Norfolk and Virginia<br />\nBeach.<br />\nCrowds of thousands began arriving<br />\non Assateague early Saturday morning,<br />\nsome drawn by the added attraction of<br />\nviewing a multitude of missle launchings from nearby Wallops Island. Most<br />\nof the probes were for atmospheric<br />\nmeasurements<br />\nconnected<br />\nwith<br />\nthe<br />\neclipse.<br />\nThe population at Assateague was<br />\nmainly of the Boy Scout variety; both<br />\nyoung and old, all seemed to share the<br />\nmotto \"Be Prepared.\" Extensive warn-<br />\n<br />\nings about possible eye damage from<br />\nlooking directly at the sun, which flooded the media for two days before the<br />\neclipse, caused many watchers to construct complex viewing apparati.<br />\nIn many cases these devices were<br />\nsimply two pieces of cardboard, one<br />\nwith a pinhole in it which focused an<br />\nimage of the sun on the second piece. But<br />\nin some instances, telescopes were used<br />\nto project a large image onto a viewing<br />\narea of white paper. Crowds gathered<br />\nat the best of these.<br />\nIn addition, nearly everyone had their<br />\nform of exposed photographic film or<br />\nsmoked glass which was used for looking directly at the sun. Cameras abounded, some hooked to elaborate viewing rigs in hopes of getting a better<br />\nimage.<br />\nAll in all, most viewers, especially<br />\nthose of the Boy Scout variety, were<br />\nshowing their scientific or pseudoscientific side. Everyone wanted to display a greater degree of preparedness<br />\nthan his neighbor, resulting in the long<br />\n<br />\nwait for totality becoming almost like a<br />\ncarnival, as one went from one booth to<br />\nthe next, viewing and appraising the setup in each.<br />\nPeople came stocked with food and<br />\nbeverage, some actually setting up useless tents for the few afternoon hours<br />\nthey spent on the beach. But most of all,<br />\nthey brought children, all showing the<br />\nsame pseudo-scientific methods, and all<br />\nbrought by their parents so that they<br />\ncould tell their grandchildren that they<br />\nwere there.<br />\nWhen the eclipse came, these people<br />\nliterally did not know what to do. All of<br />\ntheir preparation had not prepared them<br />\nfor this. An hour of waiting as the moon<br />\nslowly blocked more and more of the sun<br />\nfrom view was duly tracked and recorded by the Assateague scientists who remarked as to how it was getting darker<br />\nand colder. But suddenly, there it was.<br />\nShadows running across the ground made<br />\nit seem as if the earth itself were drawing in its breath for what was about to<br />\nhappen. A seemingly endless stream of<br />\n<br />\nThe eclipse, as seen through the nine-inch<br />\ntelescope of the Hopkins 'Observatory'. The<br />\n' picture was taken with Plus-X film. Miacke<br />\nrockets rose from across the bay as the<br />\nlast glaring bit was blocked from view<br />\nand the world around became an impressionistic landscape and the sun was reduced to a splotch of white paint around<br />\na black disc. And all the Joe Scientists<br />\ncould only drop their imperfect instruments and stare at the sky in a newfound awe.<br />\nIt was impossible to tell how long it<br />\nlasted, but as suddenly as it began it<br />\nwas over, the first bright crescent appearing; and what had seemed dark and<br />\ncold but a few minutes before now<br />\nseemed quite light and warm.<br />\n<br />\nHC Lacks Faculty Support Purge Yields New N-L Dooks;<br />\nThe Honor Commission's plan<br />\nfor an undergraduate test file<br />\nhas been halted in its final stages<br />\nbecause the tests are unavailable.<br />\n<br />\nAccording<br />\nto<br />\nCommission<br />\nmember Barry Hainer, the faculty has not been cooperative in<br />\nplacing tests at the Honor Commission's disposal.<br />\nIn order to resolve the problem, Commission members<br />\nhave been contacting department<br />\nchairmen and delinquent faculty<br />\nmembers. They hope to speed the<br />\ncollection process and to measure faculty reistance to the accumulation of such a file.<br />\n<br />\nbefore first semester finals by<br />\nDean Swanson's office.

What is missing from its programming today is the vital ingredient of yesterday, its promise.\" One has only to turn on his set<br />\ntonight to realize the truth of Kendrick's statement. Like many products of technology, what began as a promising instrument for enlightenment<br />\nand fine entertainment has become what a recent<br />\nF.C.C. commissioner calls, \"a vast wasteland.\"<br />\nAmong the many reasons for this, three are dominant, corporatism, commercialism and apathy.<br />\nIn television's infancy, like radio's, many in<br />\nthe new field and in government viewed it as a<br />\nkind of a super-utility. It was to exist as a public<br />\nmedium. For this reason the industry is theoretically controlled by a government agency which,<br />\nbefore granting its license to print money, demands that the local station present a minimum of<br />\npublic service. Corporatism limits this. N.B.C.,<br />\ngenerally considered the largest network,is owned<br />\nby the Radio Corporation of America and itself<br />\nowns a major publishing house in addition to the<br />\nfive local stations which the networks are allowed<br />\nto own.<br />\nC.B.S. owns the New York Yankees, two publishing houses, their own five stations and a host<br />\nof companies that manufacture everything from<br />\ntoys to missiles. One need not imagine a conspiracy to realize that an industry dominanted by or<br />\ninextricably a part of another is subject to influences not directly concerned with its own perform ance.<br />\n<br />\nEmil Pavlovics<br />\nTed Rohrlich<br />\n<br />\nday editor<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nFRIDAY<br />\nday editor<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\n<br />\nMark Reutter<br />\nStephen Tulloss<br />\n<br />\nresearch editor: Stuart Seidel<br />\nsports editor: George Kirschbaum<br />\n<br />\nphotography: Thomas Hoffmann<br />\nfeatures editor: John D.

It is<br />\nunfortunate that the files have not been made available<br />\nbefore this time. They should certainly be complete before this semester's finals period.<br />\nHonor Commission members claim that the files<br />\nwould be complete were faculty members quicker to<br />\nsupply copies of their back tests. It appears that the meager<br />\nresponse from professors is not due to faculty opposition<br />\nto establishing the file. It is simply a problem of convincing professors to respect a request made by undergraduates.<br />\nThere has never-been a marked willingness to notice<br />\nundergraduates at Homewood, much less to act quickly<br />\nfor their benefit. The Honor'Commission cannot hope to<br />\ncompile an accurate file in the near future if it relies on<br />\nspeedy action from the faculty.<br />\nPresumably the file is being created in response to<br />\nthe charge that fraternity members have an unfair advantage in access to the files of their houses. The Honor<br />\nCommission is acting wisely when it attempts to eliminate<br />\nthis advantage. By trying to build the Hutzler Reading<br />\nfile from scratch, however, the Commission is negating<br />\nany benefits which might be derived from its good intentions. It seems more logical to turn to those whose files<br />\nare the most complete\u2014the fraternities.<br />\n<br />\nGood Rating<br />\nThe sick state of television programming is<br />\nprimarily caused by commercialism. Herbert<br />\nHoover realized, decades ago, that if radio were<br />\nto be dominated by business, through advertizing,<br />\nthe potential of the medium would be crippled.<br />\nTelevision is not comparable to radio, however,<br />\nand its potential as a marketplace was immediately recognized. But what began as an industry<br />\nusing commercial revenue to support programming quickly became one in which the shows were<br />\nsubservient to and dependent upon their particular<br />\nsponsors.<br />\nToday's situation is one by which a program<br />\neither attains a good rating(thus proving its ability<br />\nto sell a product by its popularity) or it is cancelled. It is absurd to be angered by the frequency<br />\nof commercial interruption in view of the fact that<br />\nthe commercial is the goal, not what is sandwiched in between.<br />\nThe industry's reply to \"vast wasteland\"<br />\ncharges has always been that the public gets what<br />\nit wants. By this theory a show like \"Petticoat<br />\nJunction\" is aired, found to be popular, retains<br />\nthe support of its sponsor and is retained by the<br />\nnetwork. Since the public has voiced its approval,<br />\non what grounds can anyone complain?<br />\nIt might be argued, then, that if the publishing<br />\nindustry produced only comic books and the public<br />\nliked many of them, why should it publish books.<br />\nIt is the ability of the television industry to create<br />\ngood taste (or at least stay abreast of public standards)that is being so ruthlessly abused.<br />\n<br />\nMany of the houses have excellent files, and if the<br />\nresources of all the -houses were pooled, a fairly complete<br />\nfile would probably result. At that point, the Commission<br />\nmight apply directly to those faculty members whose tests<br />\nare not contained in the fraternity files. If the Commissior.r<br />\nacquired all of the fraternity files, the advantage which<br />\nhas accrued to brothers will be eliminated immediately. At<br />\nthat point, the Commission can worry about filling in the<br />\ngaps.<br />\n<br />\nIntimate Relationship<br />\n<br />\nIn this way, any unfair advantage could be eliminated<br />\nand a substantial file opened for students more than one<br />\nmonth before finals begin. If the Honor Commission continues to leave it up to the faculty, however, it could well<br />\nbe next spring before the files are made available.<br />\n<br />\n5liZ'Ei THER5 i<br />\nEtsITATi<br />\nTHE NIEW5 MEDiA HERE To 5E\u2022E<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nEPRE5<br />\n<br />\nMarch 10, 1970<br />\n<br />\nWhat is worse is that with few exceptions the<br />\nquality of programming has become repulsive<br />\nas<br />\nthe commercial interests have become<br />\nstronger. To everyone in the industry, the minute<br />\nyou turn your set on you are not an audience or<br />\nan intelligient participant, but a consumer<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nThere has always been an intimate relationship<br />\nbetween the movie industry and television, beyond<br />\nthe obvious fact that the later increasingly relies<br />\non movies to fill prime time hours. The film industry once feared the arrival of television and no<br />\nfear has ever existed with less justification. Of<br />\ncourse the potential of the new medium was then<br />\nenvisaged, not present reality.<br />\nTelevision has given up televised drama,documentaries, and musical performances and, with<br />\nthe exception of soap-opera,- inane situation<br />\ncomedy and the so-called hour drama, relies on<br />\nold movies and those now made \"especially for<br />\ntelevision.\"<br />\nThe film industry has exerted its greatest influence over television news and documentary<br />\npresentation. The documentary in Edward R.<br />\nMurrow's day, especially his \"See It Now\" weekly shows, consisted of skillful camera work<br />\nin<br />\nconjunction with an excellent narrative, in other<br />\nwords, made \"watching as difficult as reading.\"<br />\nMurrow and Friendly, pioneers at C.B.S.,<br />\ndemanded objectivity by showing a problem in its<br />\nvarious aspects and its causes.<br />\nToday news presentations are subjective, are<br />\ndesigned to appeal to emotion, have terrible narrative accompaniment and use flashy, meaningless<br />\ncamera techniques. Today we learn about problems by seeing women crying, people angry and<br />\nemotions flaring; fact is a by-product. The influence of the new cinematic emphasis on emotion<br />\nand subjectivity have had their effect. Television<br />\nnews is the worse for it.<br />\n<br />\nComplete Passivity<br />\nAn industry that could, as one critic put it,<br />\n\"effect our lives\" is beset not only by corporatism and commercialism but also apathy. The<br />\ntypical viewer gets angry at the network-when a<br />\nfootball game is pre-empted. A fe* people write<br />\nletters but underestimate this power and capitulate. After all, the pap that comes over the airways and into the living room is uncontrollable,<br />\nisn't it? As with every other process in modern<br />\nsociety, one feels helpless.<br />\nAll of this would not be disturbing were it not for<br />\nthe fact that television plays a major role in people's lives. Children today spend more time watching television than reading and nightly entertainment for the average family is the passive acceptance of prime time programming. The complete<br />\npassivity of this process and the non-existent<br />\namount of involvement and imagination connected with it is roughly analogous to feeding pablum<br />\nto a baby.<br />\nApathy toward change is greatest in the executive bodies of the networks. The three major<br />\nnetworks are in control and locally the affiliate suffers from little danger of losing its license.Those<br />\nentering the industry accept its standards and<br />\nthe<br />\nrare, creative person avoids television like<br />\nthe<br />\nplague. Since government ownership is abhorrent<br />\nto our national prejudices and Public broadcast<br />\ning flounders, it must be realized that television<br />\nas a tool for change, for education and creative<br />\nentertainment is only realizable if pressure from<br />\nwithout and within the industry is augmente<br />\nd.<br />\nA recent series of hour long broadcast on<br />\ns<br />\nthe history of western man was commissioned<br />\nby the B.B.C. at a cost of several hundred<br />\nthousand dollars. There were hopes in this<br />\ncountry<br />\nthat the series could be bought by one of the<br />\nnetworks and presented without commercial interuption. The series is considered one of the<br />\nbest<br />\nachievements of television. You may now see the<br />\nseries at your local museum or library at a<br />\ncost<br />\nof fifty dollars.

A cross-section of well chosen actors and actresses<br />\nPortrays those desparate souls of the thirties who brought<br />\nall their hopes to the dance marathon,which promised the<br />\ncouple who outlasted the others a tempting little prize<br />\nPackage of money. The others danced until they quite literally dropped. Jane Fonda is a very convincing contestant<br />\nnamed Gloria, whose familiarity with bad luck is<br />\nimmediately apparent when ther ailing partner almost<br />\ndisqualifies her from even entering the contest. She<br />\nquickly adopts another loner, however, who \"has nothing<br />\nbetter to do.\"<br />\nBy the time we've been through the grueling ordeal of<br />\nthe dance marathon with Gloria we can do little else but<br />\nhope that her partner does in fact oblige her in this one<br />\nkind favor of blowing her tormented brains out. The natural<br />\nProtrusion of Jane Fonda's jaw, her steady disinterested<br />\neyes, and her rapid manner of speech complete with builtin sarcasm are all more than adequate accessories for the<br />\nbelievability of hard-as-nails-born -loser Gloria, whose<br />\nhistory of hard knocks has nurtured the bitterness that<br />\nWill keep her going through most of the senseless masochistic marathon. Although her history is not fully outlined to us, we get the point.<br />\nRobert, her youthful partner, seems to be somewhat of<br />\nan ineffectual character who reminds one of a sad but<br />\n'obedient puppy dog (doleful brown eyes and all). Early he<br />\n<br />\nlearns that making conversation with Gloria is a blind<br />\nalley filled with caustic retorts. The romantics of the audlence are tempted to find some trace of a relationship<br />\nblossoming from the hours and hours of holding onto each<br />\nother that the contest requires,but Gloria does a good job<br />\nof thwarting even the most creative of imaginations in<br />\nthat folly.<br />\nSome might pose this as possible criteria for romanticizing: that she does shed Robert apparently out of disappointment in his better judgment when after one of the<br />\nbreaks she sees him emerge from the recesses of the<br />\ndance hall with vacuous pretty Alice, the budding starlet<br />\nplayed by Susannah York. Alice's participation in the marathon seems to be a stepping stone for her big break in a<br />\nsomewhat questionable rise to fame.<br />\nTrue to puppy dog form, Robert obeys Alice's sexual<br />\nplea, which we surmise she asks to reassure herself that<br />\nshe is still desirable after having sweated over her makeup, hair-style, and very impractical gown. Robert,as does<br />\nthe audience, sees through the superficiality into the pathos<br />\nof her situation. Gloria does not.She finds Alice an insufferable sissy. Gloria in fact finds most of the other women<br />\ninsufferable in one way or another, although she has moments of something akin to daughterliness to a grandmotherly spectator who sponsors her and Robert as they are<br />\nher \"favorite couple.\"<br />\nBy the time her second partner walks out on her, the<br />\nallegory intended is becoming painfully obvious. Gloria<br />\n<br />\ndances along for awhile and finally ends upwith Red Buttons, the salty sailor who has been headed for a very predictable heart attack for the entire duration of the movie.<br />\nThe ruthless ten-minute derby in which everybody wins but<br />\nthe last three couples provides the final clincher for the<br />\nprobability of the occurrence of his heart attack.<br />\n<br />\nGloria is \"tired of losing\" and drags her dying if not<br />\nalready dead (we're never quite sure) partner in and is<br />\ncounted among the winners. Giddy but wretched she protests that he is going to be all right, that they can't be<br />\ndisqualified. Conveniently, Alice,who has become Robert's<br />\npartner, goes mad as a result of this morbid episode,<br />\nand Robert is again available as Gloria's partner. \"Boy<br />\nmeets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy wins girl,\" blares the<br />\nemcee (Gig Young), and pouncing on the human interest<br />\nvalue of the \"fun couple\" trios to talk Gloria and Robert<br />\ninto getting married on the floor so that the spectators<br />\nwill have \"something to believe in.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhen Gloria learns in the course of the conversation<br />\nthat the prize Money promised to the winners of the marathon is to be subject to substantial deductions for the bills<br />\nincurred by the winners during their stay onthe premises,<br />\nshe denounces it all with a long-awaited \"What's the<br />\npoint?\". We breathe a sign of relief for her and her feet,<br />\nand are grateful to Robert for putting her out of her misery.<br />\n<br />\nDouble-Backed Beast and Society<br />\nBy RUSS GOODMAN<br />\nMy friend X and I have been pen-pals<br />\nsince I was in sixth grade. He has lived all<br />\nhis life in a remote and as yet undiscovered<br />\nisland off the coast of the southern United<br />\nStates. We communicate by carrier pigeon.<br />\nWhen I was an adolescent (several months<br />\nago) and first began to express myself about<br />\nsuch matters, I wrote X about sexual intercourse. To my surprise, he had never heard<br />\nof such an act. As he grew older he discovered that, indeed, a few members ofhis society<br />\ndid screw, but they were subjected to harsh<br />\npenalties if they were caught. The. majority<br />\nof the people on his island never engaged in<br />\nsuch practices, reproduction being accomplished by what we would call artificial insemination. There are monthly rites in which<br />\nsperm is gathered. X recently sent me the<br />\nfollowing letter:<br />\n<br />\nDear Russ,<br />\nSo many things have -happened to me<br />\nsince I last wrote you that I can't keep<br />\nit all straight. The main thing, I suppose,<br />\nis that I have finally tried what you call<br />\nsexual intercourse. I did it with a friend<br />\nof mine from school. I think I liked it, but<br />\nI am not sure. Recently, there has been<br />\n<br />\na spate of such actions by my schoolmates, and the authorities are up in arms.<br />\nYesterday, two friends of mine were<br />\nsentenced to five years in jail for what<br />\nyou call 'making love'.(What a wonderfully strange expression! Someday you<br />\nmust explain to me what 'love' means).<br />\n<br />\nCaught in the Act<br />\nThis growing problem among people<br />\nmy age has been the subject of a speech<br />\nby our principal. He argues that in this<br />\nimportant and crucial period of our island's development, any activity which<br />\ntakes people away from reality is highly<br />\ndangerous. Screwing disorients people<br />\nfor up to several hours and, in some<br />\ncases, weeks or months. It serves no<br />\nconstructive function, merely taking people away from important activities such<br />\nas their work. Though there is no evidence, he says, that screwing is physically harmful or physically addictive,there<br />\nis strong evidence that it is psychologically addictive: people who do it<br />\ntend to want to do it again. Moreover, it<br />\n<br />\ntends to distort perception. When one has<br />\nhad sexual relations with another person<br />\none tends not to look at him or her in the<br />\nnormal way, i.e., in the way one looks<br />\nat other objects in the world like books or<br />\nmachines. This is highly dangerous to the<br />\nstructure of our society. Our principal<br />\nproposes harsher penalties for anyone<br />\ncaught in the forbidden act.<br />\n<br />\nSociety's Standards<br />\nThese arguments bother me a great<br />\ndeal. I see their force, but something in<br />\ntheir whole outlook bothers me, though I<br />\ncan't put my finger on it. One of our deans<br />\nis a very liberal man, popular with many<br />\nof the students. He agrees that screwing<br />\nmay be no more dangerous than other acts<br />\nsanctioned by our state, such as the headhunting which goes on every April. But<br />\nthat is no reason to legalize it. He argues,<br />\nhowever, that since so many young people<br />\nare experimenting with this act, we<br />\nshould not penalize them, especially as<br />\nthey are likely to come to their senses<br />\n<br />\nlater on. He thinks the laws should be<br />\nmade less harsh for people caught in the<br />\nact, but that those who push this form of<br />\nbehavior on others, or who engage in it<br />\nrepeatedly, should be punished more<br />\nseverely than the casual screwer. \"We<br />\nare after the big guys,\" he says.<br />\nWhat makes the situation even more<br />\ndifficult is that many of the \u2018screwers',<br />\nas they are called, seem to be mentally<br />\nunbalanced, at least from the point of view<br />\nof society. They claim that society's<br />\nstandards are at fault, but I don't know.<br />\nI am very confused. When I tried it, I felt<br />\nsome things which I think were good, but<br />\nI can't describe them. There is talk of<br />\nputting television cameras in bedrooms<br />\nif things get any worse. This seems reasonable to many--especially those who<br />\nare scared. To me it seems a bit extreme.<br />\nAm I on to something, or should I just<br />\nget back to my study of insemination<br />\ntechniques?<br />\nYours,<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\nROTC RESPONSE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to question some of Dr.<br />\nHartman's statements in the March 3<br />\nNew -Letter. I fail to understand the<br />\nlogic of his statement: it is \"unlikely<br />\nthat these men (ROTC candidates) can<br />\ncompete with students uncommitted to<br />\nactive military service and become tomorrow's scholars.\"<br />\nI have found that having the four-year<br />\nArmy ROTC scholarship has allowed me<br />\nto concentrate my time and energy to<br />\nmy studies, free from financialworries,<br />\nwith a minimum obligation to the Army.<br />\nThe scholarship pays for all my tuition,<br />\nbooks and laboratory expenses. in addition to this, I receive 50 dollar a month<br />\n(600 dollars a year). My obligation to the<br />\nArmy while I am pursuing my undergraduate degree is to take the military science<br />\nbasic course (freshman and sophomore<br />\nyears), the military science advanced<br />\ncourse during my junior and senior years<br />\nand to attend Summer Camp for a period<br />\nof six weeks between my junior and senior<br />\nyears. The time spent in preparationfor<br />\nROTC class or actually in class represents a fraction of the time spent for any<br />\n<br />\nof my other classes and probably less than<br />\nthe time spent by a student trying to pay<br />\npart of his tuition by working at a part<br />\ntime job. I can not find any instance<br />\nwhere ROTC either directly or indirectly<br />\nhinders my training as a scholar or my<br />\nability to compete with other students.<br />\nRather, the ROTC scholarship has been a<br />\ndistinct advantage to me.<br />\n<br />\nother possibilities to present themselves,<br />\nI might still be waiting.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Hartman contends that \"It's not<br />\nfair to oblige a high school senior to sign<br />\na ROTC contract. At that age, other<br />\npossibilities may (show)up. A significant<br />\npercent may regret the decision.\"<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nTo a concerned student body member<br />\nlike me, the recent decision by the Student Affairs Commission to curtail the<br />\nextra funds needed by the News-Letter<br />\nto sustain its present biweekly status<br />\nIs reprehensible, to say the least.<br />\n<br />\nI signed the ROTC contract my senior<br />\nyear in high school on my own initiative.<br />\nTo this date, I have no reason to regret<br />\n\u2022 my decision. On entering this contract,<br />\nI assumed an obligation as does the student who participates in the National<br />\nDefense Student Loan program or the<br />\nTuition waiver for the Teacher's Education program. It is true that other possibilities may show up, but at some point,<br />\na decision must be made. If a student is<br />\nOld enough to decide that he wants to go<br />\nto college, he should be prepared to plan<br />\nhow he is going to get there. It is quite<br />\npossible that if I decided to wait for<br />\n<br />\nBill Duncan<br />\nClass of'72<br />\n<br />\nSUPPORT N\u2014L<br />\n<br />\nObviously, the News-Letter is one of<br />\nthe most important organizations on<br />\ncampus, providing one of the only organs<br />\nof communication on a campus-wide<br />\nbasis; an outlet for the various talents<br />\nof creative involvement by the staff in<br />\nwhat affects the student body here; a<br />\ndirect form of student opinion, and soon.<br />\nThe News-Letter's spontaneous decision to perform a major change and come<br />\nout twice a week only demonstrates that<br />\nthere is much more of what affects us<br />\n<br />\nthat is coming into focus and needs expression. Involvement is contingent upon<br />\nInformation, and the News-Letter is -one<br />\nof our few sources of gut information<br />\ndue to the impotency of our student<br />\ngovernment. It is hardly surprising then,<br />\nthat the Student Affairs Commission is<br />\nblind to glaring priorities and refuses to<br />\naward the News-Letter the comparatively small sum of money it needs.<br />\nThat the News-Letter staff should have<br />\nto worry about relatively minor financial<br />\nshortages in fulfilling its moral obligations to those it serves is clearly ridiculous, as it can only result in the<br />\nsquandering of time and talent which<br />\nshould be devoted to its proper functioning.<br />\nIn light of this particular issue I can<br />\nonly ask that the Student Affairs Commission re..onsider its position in light<br />\nof the fact that the News-Letter, more<br />\nthan any other Hopkins activity,is a vital<br />\norgan of the student body and deserves<br />\nproper attention and supply.<br />\n<br />\nCharles M.

Last year the swimmers faced a similar situation in going to the NCAA's at Springfield<br />\nMass.<br />\nThis year's trip to Michigan- is going to cost considerably more<br />\nthan last year's trip because of the distance and number of swimmers<br />\ninvolved. Those making the trip planto leave Tuesday night and spend<br />\nthat night at the home of one of the team's swimmers from Pittsburgh.<br />\nCompetition begins on Thursday. In all, the swimmers have to give up<br />\nthree days of classes.<br />\nWhile this year's financial problem is far from being settled, Coach<br />\nComfort took a moment out to speculate about next year's projected<br />\ncrisis. \"Next year scares me. You can't drive to California.\"<br />\nWe feel that the swimmers shouldn't have to drive to Michigan this<br />\nyear either. Having reached such a high calibre of excellence they deserve better.<br />\nRound-trip planefare for nine people, to Michigan would be $603.<br />\nA conservative estimate for meals, a motel, and car transportation<br />\nis over $900. So far the swimmers themselves have raised $300<br />\nthrough their life-guarding activities, $200 from the H-Club ($150)<br />\nand the Booster Club ($50), and $25 from TEP. The remaining $400<br />\ncan come from a number of sources.<br />\nThe easiest way to make up this $400 deficit would be for each<br />\nclass president to donate $100. If this doesn't work, the fraternities<br />\ncould be asked to give some money. The IFC could also donate at<br />\nleast $100. Assuming these sources fail to reach the $900-plus goal,<br />\nthen alumni and friends of the swimming team might be asked to donate<br />\nsomething. This last figure is the most variable of all and is the<br />\nhardest to estimate accurately.<br />\n<br />\nPostpone University Involvement<br />\nAll three of these sources only postpone a necessary university involvement and financial commitment.It becomes increasingly obvious<br />\nthat the university abuses the students. Whenever money is needed,<br />\nstudents and not the university are expected to shell out the difference. The university-wide cry for money is met with increases in tuition and the student activities fee. Such a policy is shortsighted, for<br />\nsomeday we will be alumni, and what will our rememberances of our<br />\nuniversity be? Moreover-, what will our reaction be when we're asked<br />\nto give money? Sooner or later, if it hasn't already, the university's<br />\npresent policy wilrliacIdire.<br />\nThe NCAA's are a university-sanctioned function although not a<br />\nuniversity-supported function. Hopkins'administration should support<br />\nthe swimmers financially.<br />\nThis brings me to a source of money the university should use not<br />\nonly for the swimmers but other teams' post-season trips. Despite all<br />\nmy thoughts to the contrary, the university did make money through<br />\ncharging admission to football and basketball home games.This money<br />\nshould go to finance the trips, and in seasons when the admissions'<br />\nrevenue falls below the needed funds to finance these trips then the<br />\nuniversity should step in and subsidize them.<br />\nWhy is it that our great University must continually ask the students<br />\nto pay? When those 8 or so swimmers go to Michigan, they won't be<br />\nrepresenting themselves; they will be representing Johns Hopkins.<br />\nIt is time the University realized this and helped pay for it. To date,<br />\nHopkins has not let down the athletes, simply because they have never<br />\ntaken the time nor the money to raise them up--unless forced to.<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nWrestlers Withdraw<br />\nHandicapped by a number of<br />\nInjuries to key grapplers, the<br />\nvarsity wrestling team withdrew<br />\nfrom competing in the MAC<br />\nChampionships this year. Coach<br />\nRon Belinko is quick to point out<br />\nthat this is not a trend and that<br />\nthe wrestling team is prepared<br />\nto enter the MAC competition<br />\nnext year. The long lay-off imposed by the minimester kept<br />\nmany from going out for the team,<br />\nbut a number of freshman moving up next season will make the<br />\nmatmen a realistic threat in the<br />\nMAC.<br />\n<br />\nBriefs<br />\nSwimmers Place Second<br />\nCoach Frank Comfort's swimmers placed second in their second week of championship competition as they finished second<br />\nto Elizabethtown in the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Championships. The<br />\nweek before the swimmers had<br />\nplaced second in the Mason-Dixon's. E-town swimming with<br />\nfreshmen and given the home<br />\npool advantage won the MAC meet<br />\nwith 111 points. Hopkins nators<br />\nhad 66 1/2. Complete coverage<br />\nwill appear in Friday's edition.<br />\n<br />\nDespite an average record on the season (6-7),<br />\nHopkins' fencers finished the year in grand style<br />\nby notching second place in the MAC Conference<br />\nChampionships held at the Athletic Center last<br />\nSaturday. All of the fencers performed verywell,<br />\nand never gave up, keeping within two points of<br />\nTemple all the way through the meet.<br />\nThe meet was set up so that there would be<br />\ntwo fencers from each school in each of the three<br />\nclasses, and so that both fencers would have a total<br />\nof 24 bouts. Fencing for Hopkins' in each of the<br />\nclasses were: Gerry Yee and Jesse Machbaum (6<br />\nvictories) and Jeff Rosenbaum (7 victories)in foil;<br />\nKeith Fulling (9 victories) and Rich Hamburg (9<br />\nvictories) in epee; and Paul Schwartz(10 victories)<br />\nand Gordie Rode (9 victories) in sabre.<br />\nWith a record of nine and nine in epee, Hopkins<br />\nwon the epee team trophy,while missing the sabre<br />\nteam trophy by two points. Temple, with a total<br />\nof 18 victories in foil and twenty one in sabre, took<br />\nthe other two team trophies, in addition to the<br />\nthree-weapon team trophy.<br />\n<br />\nIndividual Awards<br />\nAs far as individual awards go, the first three<br />\nawards in foil went to Joe Shamash (12 victories)<br />\nof Temple, Barry Friedberg (10 victories) of<br />\nMuhlenburg, and Dave McKirachan (9 victories)<br />\nof Lafayette. In sabre, Dan Edelman(11 victories)<br />\nof Temple took first place, with teammate Bill<br />\nGlasgold (10 victories) taking second honors. In<br />\nthird place was Paul Schwartz of Hopkins with<br />\n10 victories also.<br />\nLast of all, in epee, Xavier Wardlaw of Temple<br />\ntook first place with ten victories, followed by<br />\nJeff Spahn of Stevens with nine victories, and Rich<br />\nHamburg with nine victories from Hopkins.<br />\nThus, Coach Oles deserves a note of congratulation for leading Hopkins to an impressive<br />\nthird place in MAC competition during the season,<br />\nand fOr missing first place in the tournament by<br />\nonly three points.

(McCoy Hall is located<br />\nacross the Street from the Eisenhower Library.)<br />\nCotter proposed that the coeds be housed in the upperclass<br />\ndormitories.

John Adams, co-organizer of the Committee stated that such questions as transportation research<br />\nand social analysis are far more important than military<br />\nresearch in today's world where the quality of researchers<br />\nsuch as those at APL area.<br />\nJim Keogh indicated that a formal list of proposals<br />\nmust be formulated immediately \"because the issues<br />\nhave had enough exposure and the people need concrete<br />\nissues now.\" \"<br /><br />\n\"(Monistic Procedures\"<br /><br />\nJim Keogh, co-organizer of the Committee for APL, wants<br />\nto bypass the \"onanistic procedures\" of the University.<br /><br />\nOnce the Committee's proposals have been outlined,<br />\nthey will be presented directly to the Board of Trustees.<br />\n\"To go through the onanistic procedures(of the University)<br />\ncould only be an act of politeness to President Gordon,\"<br />\nsaid Keogh. \"And in view of Dr. Gordon's past service to<br />\nthe militaristic mandarins that we're so concerned with,<br />\nsuch difference is uncalled for.\"<br />\nKeogh explained that he feels Gordon tobe 'irrelevant'<br /><br />\nto the decision-making process at Hopkins. \"We're confident that the Board of Trustees wants to make up its<br />\nown mind.\"<br />\nIn addition to petitioning the Board of Trustees in hopes<br />\nof affecting some change in APL's research standards,<br />\nthe Committee will hold a petition compaign to rally student and faculty support. Keogh noted that they also will<br />\nseek support from state-wide groups, such as the Maryland Moratorium Committee and SANE.<br /><br />\nAreas Of Agreement<br />\nKeogh stated that this evening's meeting should \"represent a broad cross section of the University's community.\"<br />\nHe hopes to find what specific areas of agreement exist.<br />\nDespite uncertainities over the specific proposals which<br />\nwill emerge from this evenings meeting, Keogh expects<br />\na \"low-key\" campaign. \"That doesn't mean however that<br />\nwe want to get bogged down,\" he added.\"We're sure that<br />\nthe Trustees will listen to reason.\"<br />\nThe Committee will ask the Trustees to respond shortly<br />\nafter Easter. \"This will give them sufficient time to consider what we've said,\" he continued.<br />\nTo date, the workshops sponsored by the Committee<br />\nfor APL have been sporatically attenued. Nevertheless<br />\nKeogh has found them \"very useful.\" He has been in contact with people from the Applied Physics Laboratory in<br />\naddition to his Committee's work at Homewood.<br /><br />\nThe Eclipse, Assateague, and Boy Scouts;<br />\nNature Triumphs Over the Pseudo-Scientist<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nFreaks and Boy Scouts alike gathered<br />\nin droves Saturday to view \"the eclipse<br />\nof the century\" which cut a swath of darkness up the eastern coast of the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nIn Maryland, the eclipse was total in<br />\nOcean City and on Assateague Island.<br />\nOther popular gathering spots for people<br />\nfrom the Baltimore area were the Virginia portion of Assateauge, and the<br />\ncoast south to Norfolk and Virginia<br />\nBeach.<br />\nCrowds of thousands began arriving<br />\non Assateague early Saturday morning,<br />\nsome drawn by the added attraction of<br />\nviewing a multitude of missle launchings from nearby Wallops Island. Most<br />\nof the probes were for atmospheric<br />\nmeasurements<br />\nconnected<br />\nwith<br />\nthe<br />\neclipse.<br />\nThe population at Assateague was<br />\nmainly of the Boy Scout variety; both<br />\nyoung and old, all seemed to share the<br />\nmotto \"Be Prepared.\" Extensive warn-<br /><br />\nings about possible eye damage from<br />\nlooking directly at the sun, which flooded the media for two days before the<br />\neclipse, caused many watchers to construct complex viewing apparati.<br />\nIn many cases these devices were<br />\nsimply two pieces of cardboard, one<br />\nwith a pinhole in it which focused an<br />\nimage of the sun on the second piece. But<br />\nin some instances, telescopes were used<br />\nto project a large image onto a viewing<br />\narea of white paper. Crowds gathered<br />\nat the best of these.<br />\nIn addition, nearly everyone had their<br />\nform of exposed photographic film or<br />\nsmoked glass which was used for looking directly at the sun. Cameras abounded, some hooked to elaborate viewing rigs in hopes of getting a better<br />\nimage.<br />\nAll in all, most viewers, especially<br />\nthose of the Boy Scout variety, were<br />\nshowing their scientific or pseudoscientific side. Everyone wanted to display a greater degree of preparedness<br />\nthan his neighbor, resulting in the long<br /><br />\nwait for totality becoming almost like a<br />\ncarnival, as one went from one booth to<br />\nthe next, viewing and appraising the setup in each.<br />\nPeople came stocked with food and<br />\nbeverage, some actually setting up useless tents for the few afternoon hours<br />\nthey spent on the beach. But most of all,<br />\nthey brought children, all showing the<br />\nsame pseudo-scientific methods, and all<br />\nbrought by their parents so that they<br />\ncould tell their grandchildren that they<br />\nwere there.<br />\nWhen the eclipse came, these people<br />\nliterally did not know what to do. All of<br />\ntheir preparation had not prepared them<br />\nfor this. An hour of waiting as the moon<br />\nslowly blocked more and more of the sun<br />\nfrom view was duly tracked and recorded by the Assateague scientists who remarked as to how it was getting darker<br />\nand colder. But suddenly, there it was.<br />\nShadows running across the ground made<br />\nit seem as if the earth itself were drawing in its breath for what was about to<br />\nhappen. A seemingly endless stream of<br /><br />\nThe eclipse, as seen through the nine-inch<br />\ntelescope of the Hopkins 'Observatory'. The<br />\n' picture was taken with Plus-X film. Miacke<br />\nrockets rose from across the bay as the<br />\nlast glaring bit was blocked from view<br />\nand the world around became an impressionistic landscape and the sun was reduced to a splotch of white paint around<br />\na black disc. And all the Joe Scientists<br />\ncould only drop their imperfect instruments and stare at the sky in a newfound awe.<br />\nIt was impossible to tell how long it<br />\nlasted, but as suddenly as it began it<br />\nwas over, the first bright crescent appearing; and what had seemed dark and<br />\ncold but a few minutes before now<br />\nseemed quite light and warm.<br /><br />\nHC Lacks Faculty Support Purge Yields New N-L Dooks;<br />\nThe Honor Commission's plan<br />\nfor an undergraduate test file<br />\nhas been halted in its final stages<br />\nbecause the tests are unavailable.<br /><br />\nAccording<br />\nto<br />\nCommission<br />\nmember Barry Hainer, the faculty has not been cooperative in<br />\nplacing tests at the Honor Commission's disposal.<br />\nIn order to resolve the problem, Commission members<br />\nhave been contacting department<br />\nchairmen and delinquent faculty<br />\nmembers. They hope to speed the<br />\ncollection process and to measure faculty reistance to the accumulation of such a file.<br /><br />\nbefore first semester finals by<br />\nDean Swanson's office. Fewer<br />\nthan ten professors responded,<br />\nhowever.<br />\nThe file cabinets and folders<br />\nthat will contain the undergraduate test file now wait empty in<br />\nthe Hutzler Reading Room in Gilman.

Cramer, Peter Harnik<br />\nKevin Kresock<br /><br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br /><br />\nBy CHRISTOPHER OLANDER<br /><br />\nTUESDAY<br /><br />\n\"American television,\" writes Alexander Kendrick,\" is now in its third decade as a mass broadcasting instrument. What is missing from its programming today is the vital ingredient of yesterday, its promise.\" One has only to turn on his set<br />\ntonight to realize the truth of Kendrick's statement. Like many products of technology, what began as a promising instrument for enlightenment<br />\nand fine entertainment has become what a recent<br />\nF.C.C. commissioner calls, \"a vast wasteland.\"<br />\nAmong the many reasons for this, three are dominant, corporatism, commercialism and apathy.<br />\nIn television's infancy, like radio's, many in<br />\nthe new field and in government viewed it as a<br />\nkind of a super-utility. It was to exist as a public<br />\nmedium. For this reason the industry is theoretically controlled by a government agency which,<br />\nbefore granting its license to print money, demands that the local station present a minimum of<br />\npublic service. Corporatism limits this. N.B.C.,<br />\ngenerally considered the largest network,is owned<br />\nby the Radio Corporation of America and itself<br />\nowns a major publishing house in addition to the<br />\nfive local stations which the networks are allowed<br />\nto own.<br />\nC.B.S. owns the New York Yankees, two publishing houses, their own five stations and a host<br />\nof companies that manufacture everything from<br />\ntoys to missiles. One need not imagine a conspiracy to realize that an industry dominanted by or<br />\ninextricably a part of another is subject to influences not directly concerned with its own perform ance.<br /><br />\nEmil Pavlovics<br />\nTed Rohrlich<br /><br />\nday editor<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nFRIDAY<br />\nday editor<br />\nmanaging editor<br /><br />\nMark Reutter<br />\nStephen Tulloss<br /><br />\nresearch editor: Stuart Seidel<br />\nsports editor: George Kirschbaum<br /><br />\nphotography: Thomas Hoffmann<br />\nfeatures editor: John D.

It is<br />\nunfortunate that the files have not been made available<br />\nbefore this time. They should certainly be complete before this semester's finals period.<br />\nHonor Commission members claim that the files<br />\nwould be complete were faculty members quicker to<br />\nsupply copies of their back tests. It appears that the meager<br />\nresponse from professors is not due to faculty opposition<br />\nto establishing the file. It is simply a problem of convincing professors to respect a request made by undergraduates.<br />\nThere has never-been a marked willingness to notice<br />\nundergraduates at Homewood, much less to act quickly<br />\nfor their benefit. The Honor'Commission cannot hope to<br />\ncompile an accurate file in the near future if it relies on<br />\nspeedy action from the faculty.<br />\nPresumably the file is being created in response to<br />\nthe charge that fraternity members have an unfair advantage in access to the files of their houses. The Honor<br />\nCommission is acting wisely when it attempts to eliminate<br />\nthis advantage. By trying to build the Hutzler Reading<br />\nfile from scratch, however, the Commission is negating<br />\nany benefits which might be derived from its good intentions. It seems more logical to turn to those whose files<br />\nare the most complete\u2014the fraternities.<br /><br />\nGood Rating<br />\nThe sick state of television programming is<br />\nprimarily caused by commercialism. Herbert<br />\nHoover realized, decades ago, that if radio were<br />\nto be dominated by business, through advertizing,<br />\nthe potential of the medium would be crippled.<br />\nTelevision is not comparable to radio, however,<br />\nand its potential as a marketplace was immediately recognized. But what began as an industry<br />\nusing commercial revenue to support programming quickly became one in which the shows were<br />\nsubservient to and dependent upon their particular<br />\nsponsors.<br />\nToday's situation is one by which a program<br />\neither attains a good rating(thus proving its ability<br />\nto sell a product by its popularity) or it is cancelled. It is absurd to be angered by the frequency<br />\nof commercial interruption in view of the fact that<br />\nthe commercial is the goal, not what is sandwiched in between.<br />\nThe industry's reply to \"vast wasteland\"<br />\ncharges has always been that the public gets what<br />\nit wants. By this theory a show like \"Petticoat<br />\nJunction\" is aired, found to be popular, retains<br />\nthe support of its sponsor and is retained by the<br />\nnetwork. Since the public has voiced its approval,<br />\non what grounds can anyone complain?<br />\nIt might be argued, then, that if the publishing<br />\nindustry produced only comic books and the public<br />\nliked many of them, why should it publish books.<br />\nIt is the ability of the television industry to create<br />\ngood taste (or at least stay abreast of public standards)that is being so ruthlessly abused.<br /><br />\nMany of the houses have excellent files, and if the<br />\nresources of all the -houses were pooled, a fairly complete<br />\nfile would probably result. At that point, the Commission<br />\nmight apply directly to those faculty members whose tests<br />\nare not contained in the fraternity files. If the Commissior.r<br />\nacquired all of the fraternity files, the advantage which<br />\nhas accrued to brothers will be eliminated immediately. At<br />\nthat point, the Commission can worry about filling in the<br />\ngaps.<br /><br />\nIntimate Relationship<br /><br />\nIn this way, any unfair advantage could be eliminated<br />\nand a substantial file opened for students more than one<br />\nmonth before finals begin. If the Honor Commission continues to leave it up to the faculty, however, it could well<br />\nbe next spring before the files are made available.<br /><br />\n5liZ'Ei THER5 i<br />\nEtsITATi<br />\nTHE NIEW5 MEDiA HERE To 5E\u2022E<br />\nA<br /><br />\nEPRE5<br /><br />\nMarch 10, 1970<br /><br />\nWhat is worse is that with few exceptions the<br />\nquality of programming has become repulsive<br />\nas<br />\nthe commercial interests have become<br />\nstronger. To everyone in the industry, the minute<br />\nyou turn your set on you are not an audience or<br />\nan intelligient participant, but a consumer<br />\n.<br /><br />\nThere has always been an intimate relationship<br />\nbetween the movie industry and television, beyond<br />\nthe obvious fact that the later increasingly relies<br />\non movies to fill prime time hours. The film industry once feared the arrival of television and no<br />\nfear has ever existed with less justification. Of<br />\ncourse the potential of the new medium was then<br />\nenvisaged, not present reality.<br />\nTelevision has given up televised drama,documentaries, and musical performances and, with<br />\nthe exception of soap-opera,- inane situation<br />\ncomedy and the so-called hour drama, relies on<br />\nold movies and those now made \"especially for<br />\ntelevision.\"<br />\nThe film industry has exerted its greatest influence over television news and documentary<br />\npresentation. The documentary in Edward R.<br />\nMurrow's day, especially his \"See It Now\" weekly shows, consisted of skillful camera work<br />\nin<br />\nconjunction with an excellent narrative, in other<br />\nwords, made \"watching as difficult as reading.\"<br />\nMurrow and Friendly, pioneers at C.B.S.,<br />\ndemanded objectivity by showing a problem in its<br />\nvarious aspects and its causes.<br />\nToday news presentations are subjective, are<br />\ndesigned to appeal to emotion, have terrible narrative accompaniment and use flashy, meaningless<br />\ncamera techniques. Today we learn about problems by seeing women crying, people angry and<br />\nemotions flaring; fact is a by-product. The influence of the new cinematic emphasis on emotion<br />\nand subjectivity have had their effect. Television<br />\nnews is the worse for it.<br /><br />\nComplete Passivity<br />\nAn industry that could, as one critic put it,<br />\n\"effect our lives\" is beset not only by corporatism and commercialism but also apathy. The<br />\ntypical viewer gets angry at the network-when a<br />\nfootball game is pre-empted. A fe* people write<br />\nletters but underestimate this power and capitulate. After all, the pap that comes over the airways and into the living room is uncontrollable,<br />\nisn't it? As with every other process in modern<br />\nsociety, one feels helpless.<br />\nAll of this would not be disturbing were it not for<br />\nthe fact that television plays a major role in people's lives. Children today spend more time watching television than reading and nightly entertainment for the average family is the passive acceptance of prime time programming. The complete<br />\npassivity of this process and the non-existent<br />\namount of involvement and imagination connected with it is roughly analogous to feeding pablum<br />\nto a baby.<br />\nApathy toward change is greatest in the executive bodies of the networks. The three major<br />\nnetworks are in control and locally the affiliate suffers from little danger of losing its license.Those<br />\nentering the industry accept its standards and<br />\nthe<br />\nrare, creative person avoids television like<br />\nthe<br />\nplague. Since government ownership is abhorrent<br />\nto our national prejudices and Public broadcast<br />\ning flounders, it must be realized that television<br />\nas a tool for change, for education and creative<br />\nentertainment is only realizable if pressure from<br />\nwithout and within the industry is augmente<br />\nd.<br />\nA recent series of hour long broadcast on<br />\ns<br />\nthe history of western man was commissioned<br />\nby the B.B.C. at a cost of several hundred<br />\nthousand dollars.

A cross-section of well chosen actors and actresses<br />\nPortrays those desparate souls of the thirties who brought<br />\nall their hopes to the dance marathon,which promised the<br />\ncouple who outlasted the others a tempting little prize<br />\nPackage of money. The others danced until they quite literally dropped. Jane Fonda is a very convincing contestant<br />\nnamed Gloria, whose familiarity with bad luck is<br />\nimmediately apparent when ther ailing partner almost<br />\ndisqualifies her from even entering the contest. She<br />\nquickly adopts another loner, however, who \"has nothing<br />\nbetter to do.\"<br />\nBy the time we've been through the grueling ordeal of<br />\nthe dance marathon with Gloria we can do little else but<br />\nhope that her partner does in fact oblige her in this one<br />\nkind favor of blowing her tormented brains out. The natural<br />\nProtrusion of Jane Fonda's jaw, her steady disinterested<br />\neyes, and her rapid manner of speech complete with builtin sarcasm are all more than adequate accessories for the<br />\nbelievability of hard-as-nails-born -loser Gloria, whose<br />\nhistory of hard knocks has nurtured the bitterness that<br />\nWill keep her going through most of the senseless masochistic marathon. Although her history is not fully outlined to us, we get the point.<br />\nRobert, her youthful partner, seems to be somewhat of<br />\nan ineffectual character who reminds one of a sad but<br />\n'obedient puppy dog (doleful brown eyes and all). Early he<br /><br />\nlearns that making conversation with Gloria is a blind<br />\nalley filled with caustic retorts. The romantics of the audlence are tempted to find some trace of a relationship<br />\nblossoming from the hours and hours of holding onto each<br />\nother that the contest requires,but Gloria does a good job<br />\nof thwarting even the most creative of imaginations in<br />\nthat folly.<br />\nSome might pose this as possible criteria for romanticizing: that she does shed Robert apparently out of disappointment in his better judgment when after one of the<br />\nbreaks she sees him emerge from the recesses of the<br />\ndance hall with vacuous pretty Alice, the budding starlet<br />\nplayed by Susannah York. Alice's participation in the marathon seems to be a stepping stone for her big break in a<br />\nsomewhat questionable rise to fame.<br />\nTrue to puppy dog form, Robert obeys Alice's sexual<br />\nplea, which we surmise she asks to reassure herself that<br />\nshe is still desirable after having sweated over her makeup, hair-style, and very impractical gown. Robert,as does<br />\nthe audience, sees through the superficiality into the pathos<br />\nof her situation. Gloria does not.She finds Alice an insufferable sissy. Gloria in fact finds most of the other women<br />\ninsufferable in one way or another, although she has moments of something akin to daughterliness to a grandmotherly spectator who sponsors her and Robert as they are<br />\nher \"favorite couple.\"<br />\nBy the time her second partner walks out on her, the<br />\nallegory intended is becoming painfully obvious. Gloria<br /><br />\ndances along for awhile and finally ends upwith Red Buttons, the salty sailor who has been headed for a very predictable heart attack for the entire duration of the movie.<br />\nThe ruthless ten-minute derby in which everybody wins but<br />\nthe last three couples provides the final clincher for the<br />\nprobability of the occurrence of his heart attack.<br /><br />\nGloria is \"tired of losing\" and drags her dying if not<br />\nalready dead (we're never quite sure) partner in and is<br />\ncounted among the winners. Giddy but wretched she protests that he is going to be all right, that they can't be<br />\ndisqualified. Conveniently, Alice,who has become Robert's<br />\npartner, goes mad as a result of this morbid episode,<br />\nand Robert is again available as Gloria's partner. \"Boy<br />\nmeets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy wins girl,\" blares the<br />\nemcee (Gig Young), and pouncing on the human interest<br />\nvalue of the \"fun couple\" trios to talk Gloria and Robert<br />\ninto getting married on the floor so that the spectators<br />\nwill have \"something to believe in.\"<br /><br />\nWhen Gloria learns in the course of the conversation<br />\nthat the prize Money promised to the winners of the marathon is to be subject to substantial deductions for the bills<br />\nincurred by the winners during their stay onthe premises,<br />\nshe denounces it all with a long-awaited \"What's the<br />\npoint?\". We breathe a sign of relief for her and her feet,<br />\nand are grateful to Robert for putting her out of her misery.<br /><br />\nDouble-Backed Beast and Society<br />\nBy RUSS GOODMAN<br />\nMy friend X and I have been pen-pals<br />\nsince I was in sixth grade. He has lived all<br />\nhis life in a remote and as yet undiscovered<br />\nisland off the coast of the southern United<br />\nStates. We communicate by carrier pigeon.<br />\nWhen I was an adolescent (several months<br />\nago) and first began to express myself about<br />\nsuch matters, I wrote X about sexual intercourse. To my surprise, he had never heard<br />\nof such an act. As he grew older he discovered that, indeed, a few members ofhis society<br />\ndid screw, but they were subjected to harsh<br />\npenalties if they were caught. The. majority<br />\nof the people on his island never engaged in<br />\nsuch practices, reproduction being accomplished by what we would call artificial insemination. There are monthly rites in which<br />\nsperm is gathered. X recently sent me the<br />\nfollowing letter:<br /><br />\nDear Russ,<br />\nSo many things have -happened to me<br />\nsince I last wrote you that I can't keep<br />\nit all straight. The main thing, I suppose,<br />\nis that I have finally tried what you call<br />\nsexual intercourse. I did it with a friend<br />\nof mine from school. I think I liked it, but<br />\nI am not sure. Recently, there has been<br /><br />\na spate of such actions by my schoolmates, and the authorities are up in arms.<br />\nYesterday, two friends of mine were<br />\nsentenced to five years in jail for what<br />\nyou call 'making love'.(What a wonderfully strange expression! Someday you<br />\nmust explain to me what 'love' means).<br /><br />\nCaught in the Act<br />\nThis growing problem among people<br />\nmy age has been the subject of a speech<br />\nby our principal. He argues that in this<br />\nimportant and crucial period of our island's development, any activity which<br />\ntakes people away from reality is highly<br />\ndangerous. Screwing disorients people<br />\nfor up to several hours and, in some<br />\ncases, weeks or months. It serves no<br />\nconstructive function, merely taking people away from important activities such<br />\nas their work. Though there is no evidence, he says, that screwing is physically harmful or physically addictive,there<br />\nis strong evidence that it is psychologically addictive: people who do it<br />\ntend to want to do it again. Moreover, it<br /><br />\ntends to distort perception. When one has<br />\nhad sexual relations with another person<br />\none tends not to look at him or her in the<br />\nnormal way, i.e., in the way one looks<br />\nat other objects in the world like books or<br />\nmachines. This is highly dangerous to the<br />\nstructure of our society. Our principal<br />\nproposes harsher penalties for anyone<br />\ncaught in the forbidden act.<br /><br />\nSociety's Standards<br />\nThese arguments bother me a great<br />\ndeal. I see their force, but something in<br />\ntheir whole outlook bothers me, though I<br />\ncan't put my finger on it. One of our deans<br />\nis a very liberal man, popular with many<br />\nof the students. He agrees that screwing<br />\nmay be no more dangerous than other acts<br />\nsanctioned by our state, such as the headhunting which goes on every April. But<br />\nthat is no reason to legalize it. He argues,<br />\nhowever, that since so many young people<br />\nare experimenting with this act, we<br />\nshould not penalize them, especially as<br />\nthey are likely to come to their senses<br /><br />\nlater on. He thinks the laws should be<br />\nmade less harsh for people caught in the<br />\nact, but that those who push this form of<br />\nbehavior on others, or who engage in it<br />\nrepeatedly, should be punished more<br />\nseverely than the casual screwer. \"We<br />\nare after the big guys,\" he says.<br />\nWhat makes the situation even more<br />\ndifficult is that many of the \u2018screwers',<br />\nas they are called, seem to be mentally<br />\nunbalanced, at least from the point of view<br />\nof society. They claim that society's<br />\nstandards are at fault, but I don't know.<br />\nI am very confused. When I tried it, I felt<br />\nsome things which I think were good, but<br />\nI can't describe them. There is talk of<br />\nputting television cameras in bedrooms<br />\nif things get any worse. This seems reasonable to many--especially those who<br />\nare scared. To me it seems a bit extreme.<br />\nAm I on to something, or should I just<br />\nget back to my study of insemination<br />\ntechniques?<br />\nYours,<br />\nX<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\nROTC RESPONSE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to question some of Dr.<br />\nHartman's statements in the March 3<br />\nNew -Letter. I fail to understand the<br />\nlogic of his statement: it is \"unlikely<br />\nthat these men (ROTC candidates) can<br />\ncompete with students uncommitted to<br />\nactive military service and become tomorrow's scholars.\"<br />\nI have found that having the four-year<br />\nArmy ROTC scholarship has allowed me<br />\nto concentrate my time and energy to<br />\nmy studies, free from financialworries,<br />\nwith a minimum obligation to the Army.<br />\nThe scholarship pays for all my tuition,<br />\nbooks and laboratory expenses. in addition to this, I receive 50 dollar a month<br />\n(600 dollars a year). My obligation to the<br />\nArmy while I am pursuing my undergraduate degree is to take the military science<br />\nbasic course (freshman and sophomore<br />\nyears), the military science advanced<br />\ncourse during my junior and senior years<br />\nand to attend Summer Camp for a period<br />\nof six weeks between my junior and senior<br />\nyears. The time spent in preparationfor<br />\nROTC class or actually in class represents a fraction of the time spent for any<br /><br />\nof my other classes and probably less than<br />\nthe time spent by a student trying to pay<br />\npart of his tuition by working at a part<br />\ntime job. I can not find any instance<br />\nwhere ROTC either directly or indirectly<br />\nhinders my training as a scholar or my<br />\nability to compete with other students.<br />\nRather, the ROTC scholarship has been a<br />\ndistinct advantage to me.<br /><br />\nother possibilities to present themselves,<br />\nI might still be waiting.<br /><br />\nDr. Hartman contends that \"It's not<br />\nfair to oblige a high school senior to sign<br />\na ROTC contract. At that age, other<br />\npossibilities may (show)up. A significant<br />\npercent may regret the decision.\"<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nTo a concerned student body member<br />\nlike me, the recent decision by the Student Affairs Commission to curtail the<br />\nextra funds needed by the News-Letter<br />\nto sustain its present biweekly status<br />\nIs reprehensible, to say the least.<br /><br />\nI signed the ROTC contract my senior<br />\nyear in high school on my own initiative.<br />\nTo this date, I have no reason to regret<br />\n\u2022 my decision. On entering this contract,<br />\nI assumed an obligation as does the student who participates in the National<br />\nDefense Student Loan program or the<br />\nTuition waiver for the Teacher's Education program. It is true that other possibilities may show up, but at some point,<br />\na decision must be made. If a student is<br />\nOld enough to decide that he wants to go<br />\nto college, he should be prepared to plan<br />\nhow he is going to get there. It is quite<br />\npossible that if I decided to wait for<br /><br />\nBill Duncan<br />\nClass of'72<br /><br />\nSUPPORT N\u2014L<br /><br />\nObviously, the News-Letter is one of<br />\nthe most important organizations on<br />\ncampus, providing one of the only organs<br />\nof communication on a campus-wide<br />\nbasis; an outlet for the various talents<br />\nof creative involvement by the staff in<br />\nwhat affects the student body here; a<br />\ndirect form of student opinion, and soon.<br />\nThe News-Letter's spontaneous decision to perform a major change and come<br />\nout twice a week only demonstrates that<br />\nthere is much more of what affects us<br /><br />\nthat is coming into focus and needs expression. Involvement is contingent upon<br />\nInformation, and the News-Letter is -one<br />\nof our few sources of gut information<br />\ndue to the impotency of our student<br />\ngovernment. It is hardly surprising then,<br />\nthat the Student Affairs Commission is<br />\nblind to glaring priorities and refuses to<br />\naward the News-Letter the comparatively small sum of money it needs.<br />\nThat the News-Letter staff should have<br />\nto worry about relatively minor financial<br />\nshortages in fulfilling its moral obligations to those it serves is clearly ridiculous, as it can only result in the<br />\nsquandering of time and talent which<br />\nshould be devoted to its proper functioning.<br />\nIn light of this particular issue I can<br />\nonly ask that the Student Affairs Commission re..onsider its position in light<br />\nof the fact that the News-Letter, more<br />\nthan any other Hopkins activity,is a vital<br />\norgan of the student body and deserves<br />\nproper attention and supply.<br /><br />\nCharles M. Urruela, Jr.<br />\nClass of'72<br /><br />\nPAGE 6<br /><br />\nMarch 10, 1970<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nnews-letter :Nports<br />\nFencers Cap Average Year<br />\nNest<br />\nWith 2nd Place Win in MAC<br />\nBy GEORGE KIRSCHBAUM<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER,<br />\nAt press time, Coach Comfortwas counting on eight of his freshman<br />\nand varsity swimmers to qualify for the NC AA College Division Cham pionships which this year are being held at Oakland University in<br />\nRochester, Michigan.<br />\nUnder Comfort's excellent coaching and recruiting, the college<br />\ndivision championships have become part of the Hopkins Swimming<br />\nProgram even though they are not accepted as such by the Director<br />\nof Athletics or the University administration. Last year the swimmers faced a similar situation in going to the NCAA's at Springfield<br />\nMass.<br />\nThis year's trip to Michigan- is going to cost considerably more<br />\nthan last year's trip because of the distance and number of swimmers<br />\ninvolved. Those making the trip planto leave Tuesday night and spend<br />\nthat night at the home of one of the team's swimmers from Pittsburgh.<br />\nCompetition begins on Thursday. In all, the swimmers have to give up<br />\nthree days of classes.<br />\nWhile this year's financial problem is far from being settled, Coach<br />\nComfort took a moment out to speculate about next year's projected<br />\ncrisis. \"Next year scares me. You can't drive to California.\"<br />\nWe feel that the swimmers shouldn't have to drive to Michigan this<br />\nyear either. Having reached such a high calibre of excellence they deserve better.<br />\nRound-trip planefare for nine people, to Michigan would be $603.<br />\nA conservative estimate for meals, a motel, and car transportation<br />\nis over $900. So far the swimmers themselves have raised $300<br />\nthrough their life-guarding activities, $200 from the H-Club ($150)<br />\nand the Booster Club ($50), and $25 from TEP. The remaining $400<br />\ncan come from a number of sources.<br />\nThe easiest way to make up this $400 deficit would be for each<br />\nclass president to donate $100. If this doesn't work, the fraternities<br />\ncould be asked to give some money. The IFC could also donate at<br />\nleast $100. Assuming these sources fail to reach the $900-plus goal,<br />\nthen alumni and friends of the swimming team might be asked to donate<br />\nsomething. This last figure is the most variable of all and is the<br />\nhardest to estimate accurately.<br /><br />\nPostpone University Involvement<br />\nAll three of these sources only postpone a necessary university involvement and financial commitment.It becomes increasingly obvious<br />\nthat the university abuses the students. Whenever money is needed,<br />\nstudents and not the university are expected to shell out the difference. The university-wide cry for money is met with increases in tuition and the student activities fee. Such a policy is shortsighted, for<br />\nsomeday we will be alumni, and what will our rememberances of our<br />\nuniversity be? Moreover-, what will our reaction be when we're asked<br />\nto give money? Sooner or later, if it hasn't already, the university's<br />\npresent policy wilrliacIdire.<br />\nThe NCAA's are a university-sanctioned function although not a<br />\nuniversity-supported function. Hopkins'administration should support<br />\nthe swimmers financially.<br />\nThis brings me to a source of money the university should use not<br />\nonly for the swimmers but other teams' post-season trips. Despite all<br />\nmy thoughts to the contrary, the university did make money through<br />\ncharging admission to football and basketball home games.This money<br />\nshould go to finance the trips, and in seasons when the admissions'<br />\nrevenue falls below the needed funds to finance these trips then the<br />\nuniversity should step in and subsidize them.<br />\nWhy is it that our great University must continually ask the students<br />\nto pay? When those 8 or so swimmers go to Michigan, they won't be<br />\nrepresenting themselves; they will be representing Johns Hopkins.<br />\nIt is time the University realized this and helped pay for it. To date,<br />\nHopkins has not let down the athletes, simply because they have never<br />\ntaken the time nor the money to raise them up--unless forced to.<br /><br />\nSports<br />\nWrestlers Withdraw<br />\nHandicapped by a number of<br />\nInjuries to key grapplers, the<br />\nvarsity wrestling team withdrew<br />\nfrom competing in the MAC<br />\nChampionships this year. Coach<br />\nRon Belinko is quick to point out<br />\nthat this is not a trend and that<br />\nthe wrestling team is prepared<br />\nto enter the MAC competition<br />\nnext year. The long lay-off imposed by the minimester kept<br />\nmany from going out for the team,<br />\nbut a number of freshman moving up next season will make the<br />\nmatmen a realistic threat in the<br />\nMAC.<br /><br />\nBriefs<br />\nSwimmers Place Second<br />\nCoach Frank Comfort's swimmers placed second in their second week of championship competition as they finished second<br />\nto Elizabethtown in the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Championships. The<br />\nweek before the swimmers had<br />\nplaced second in the Mason-Dixon's. E-town swimming with<br />\nfreshmen and given the home<br />\npool advantage won the MAC meet<br />\nwith 111 points. Hopkins nators<br />\nhad 66 1/2. Complete coverage<br />\nwill appear in Friday's edition.<br /><br />\nDespite an average record on the season (6-7),<br />\nHopkins' fencers finished the year in grand style<br />\nby notching second place in the MAC Conference<br />\nChampionships held at the Athletic Center last<br />\nSaturday. All of the fencers performed verywell,<br />\nand never gave up, keeping within two points of<br />\nTemple all the way through the meet.<br />\nThe meet was set up so that there would be<br />\ntwo fencers from each school in each of the three<br />\nclasses, and so that both fencers would have a total<br />\nof 24 bouts. Fencing for Hopkins' in each of the<br />\nclasses were: Gerry Yee and Jesse Machbaum (6<br />\nvictories) and Jeff Rosenbaum (7 victories)in foil;<br />\nKeith Fulling (9 victories) and Rich Hamburg (9<br />\nvictories) in epee; and Paul Schwartz(10 victories)<br />\nand Gordie Rode (9 victories) in sabre.<br />\nWith a record of nine and nine in epee, Hopkins<br />\nwon the epee team trophy,while missing the sabre<br />\nteam trophy by two points. Temple, with a total<br />\nof 18 victories in foil and twenty one in sabre, took<br />\nthe other two team trophies, in addition to the<br />\nthree-weapon team trophy.<br /><br />\nIndividual Awards<br />\nAs far as individual awards go, the first three<br />\nawards in foil went to Joe Shamash (12 victories)<br />\nof Temple, Barry Friedberg (10 victories) of<br />\nMuhlenburg, and Dave McKirachan (9 victories)<br />\nof Lafayette. In sabre, Dan Edelman(11 victories)<br />\nof Temple took first place, with teammate Bill<br />\nGlasgold (10 victories) taking second honors. In<br />\nthird place was Paul Schwartz of Hopkins with<br />\n10 victories also.<br />\nLast of all, in epee, Xavier Wardlaw of Temple<br />\ntook first place with ten victories, followed by<br />\nJeff Spahn of Stevens with nine victories, and Rich<br />\nHamburg with nine victories from Hopkins.<br />\nThus, Coach Oles deserves a note of congratulation for leading Hopkins to an impressive<br />\nthird place in MAC competition during the season,<br />\nand fOr missing first place in the tournament by<br />\nonly three points.
