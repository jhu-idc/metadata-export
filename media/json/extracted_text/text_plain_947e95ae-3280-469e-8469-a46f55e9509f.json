And just how do<br />\nHopkins departments work? They debate substantive<br />\nconflicts in terms of procedure and mask their debates<br />\nin secrecy.<br />\nThe most recent example occurred this week in the<br />\nSocial Relations department. Unlike other courses<br />\nwhich are automatically approved by the chairman, the<br />\ndepartment saw fit to review Dr. Chester Wickwire's<br />\nrequest to add two more courses to its paultry offerings<br />\nthis semester. Meeting in privacy, without even the<br />\ncourtesy to allow Dr. Wickwire to defend his program<br />\n(protocol restricts \"part-time lecturers\" from such<br />\ndeliberations), they concluded the courses are inappropriate.<br />\nWickwire was notified in writing of the decision<br />\nyesterday without explanation. When the News-Letter<br />\ntried to find out what had happened, the department<br />\nchairman refused to comment, saying he will only<br />\nanswer written inquiries.<br />\nSo an inkling of what happened to the courses has been<br />\neffectively stifled and with that, the 150 students who<br />\nexpressed interest in the two rejected courses have been<br />\ncheated.<br />\nThe main point, however, is not the numerous obstacles Wickwire has to face in order to develop practical courses in sociology. Rather it is the control<br />\nprofessors exercise, exclusively running \"their\"<br />\ndepartments without any attempt to garner junior<br />\nfaculty or student opinion.<br />\n<br />\nRight Train...<br />\nWrong Track<br />\nThe Student Council climbed aboard the right train in<br />\nmaking the decision to fight the new discipline code, but<br />\nthe train is on the wrong track. The Council has refused<br />\nto appoint students to man a hearing board, as long as<br />\nthe rules of the game call for approval of the appointees<br />\nby Dean Benton. We applaud their action. But the<br />\nCouncil has also announced plans to spend $5,000 in<br />\nstudent activity funds to hire an attorney to fight the<br />\ncode in court.<br />\nClaiming the code is vague and overbroad, the Council<br />\nwants an injunction barring the University from enforcement.<br />\nNo court in the land will take on a test case involving<br />\nan as yet unenforced code. The lawsuit contemplated by<br />\nthe ten students suspended last summer is a different<br />\nstory. They will seek a court judgement on a discipline<br />\ncase after the fact.<br />\nAs it stands now, we can only regard the proposed SC<br />\nsuit as foolhardy and wasteful. It is time for the SC to<br />\nemerge from its self-imposed hibernation with a drive to<br />\norganize the student body behind the positions of its<br />\nelected officials. The question of tactics is one for the<br />\nstudent body to decide. If students want to work through<br />\nthe new governance channels to fight the code, fine. If<br />\nthey want to take to the \"streets\", then we will have a<br />\ntest case.<br />\n<br />\nDefending Governance<br />\nBy T. CHRISTOPHER BEACH.<br />\nThe Summer Goverance Committee has<br />\nsubmitted to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts<br />\nand Sciences a report that recommends a<br />\nnew system of governance for this division.<br />\nCopies of the report are now being printed<br />\nand within a few days will be returned and<br />\ndistributed to all members of the division.<br />\nThe committee's conception of how the<br />\ndivision has previously been governed is well<br />\nstated in the introductory chapter of the<br />\nreport.\"An almost universal theme, running<br />\nalike through administration, faculty, and<br />\nstudents, was the perilously high level of<br />\nfrustration over how and where to get things<br />\ndone. Individual grievances and suggestions<br />\nhave not been acted upon or even answered.<br />\n\"Academic and nonacademic programs<br />\nand policies have emerged full grown, like<br />\nBotticelli's Venus, from the depths of administrative silence.\" That silence has<br />\npervaded all levels of this division, from the<br />\nStudent Council's administering of its affairs<br />\nto the \"Administration's\" administering of<br />\neveryone' affairs.<br />\nThe committee did not seek, however, to<br />\naddress its report to specific issues raised or<br />\nspecific decisions made in the past two or<br />\nthree years. Rather, the attempt was to<br />\npropose a new system that clearly defines<br />\nwhere an individual issue may be discussed<br />\nand where a decision made. '<br />\nThe purpose of establishing such a<br />\nsystem is twofold: (1) to guarantee that an<br />\nindividual's opinion on a specific subject<br />\nwould be heard at a point where a decision<br />\ncould be affected and (2) to guarantee that<br />\nthe thought behind his opinion would be<br />\nanswered, if not acted upon.<br />\nRight to Advise<br />\nIn the report, the above guarantees are<br />\ntermed \"the right to advise\" and the right to<br />\nhold accountable those who are advised.\" In<br />\npractice, the guarantees mean that before<br />\nan administrator makes a decision, he must<br />\ninform those groups to be affected by the<br />\ndecision and seek either their advice or the<br />\nadvice of a duly constituted body that<br />\nrepresents them. If such advance is refected<br />\nof modified at the time of the decision, the<br />\nadministrator must explain his decision if<br />\nthe advisory body, or group, so requests.<br />\nBecause Woody Bennett and .Harry<br />\nSingleton, two of the undergraduate<br />\nmembers of the committee, have not signed<br />\nthe majority report and have explained<br />\nthemselves in two separate minority<br />\nreports. I would like to explain why I, the<br />\nthird undergraduate, have endorsed the<br />\nrecommendations of the majority report.<br />\nFlexible System<br />\nIf put into effect, the recommended<br />\nsystem can be amended so that parts of it<br />\n<br />\nwith which I disagree can be reconsidered<br />\nand perhaps changed. If put into effect, the<br />\nrecommended system will permit any individual or group of individuals who have<br />\nraised a controversial issue to know why<br />\nthey have been accepted or rejected.<br />\nMore specifically, if the Arts and Sciences<br />\nRepresentative Council is established, the<br />\nundergraduates, graduate students,<br />\nresearch staff and faculty will finally have a<br />\nchance to cooperate and, as a single group,<br />\nadvise the Dean. Although some students<br />\nargue that advisory power is no power, I<br />\ncan't agree. As stated in its constitution, the<br />\nAcademic Council had only advisory<br />\npower; yet, the power -Mat our faculty<br />\ngenerates through its Council is as great as<br />\nthe faculty power in any other university in<br />\nthe country.<br />\nDepartment Guidelines<br />\nFurther, the departmental guidelines that<br />\nhave been recommended offer an even more<br />\nsignificant change in governance. If adopted<br />\nand followed, these guidelines offer the<br />\nstudent a much greater chance to determine<br />\nthe course of his education. As, such the<br />\nguidelines are easily the most important<br />\nproposal.<br />\nAt the present moment academic and nonacademic issues are pressing for resolution.<br />\nAlready, controversy over the issues of APL<br />\nand ROTC has begun again. Already, Dean<br />\nCode of Conduct is being<br />\nBenton's<br />\nchallenged. These and other issues require<br />\nextensive discussion and major dicisions of<br />\npolicy. If the discussion is to be 'reasonable<br />\nand the decisions responsible, the proposed<br />\nsystem of governance should be accepted by<br />\nall members of the division.<br />\nBest Alternative<br />\nOur choice is either to accept or reject the<br />\nproposals. If we accept them, we know<br />\nwhat the means are for effecting' student<br />\nvoice. If we reject them we have either no<br />\nmeans, or what is more likely, we have<br />\nmeans determined by the Dean.<br />\nIf our objective is to seek better methods of<br />\neducation and in doing so, to determine<br />\nhow we are to face the issues mentioned<br />\nabove, I would hope that we choose a system<br />\nprososed by a committee of different<br />\nmembers from the community rather than<br />\nchoose no system or a system by one isolated<br />\nadministrator, Dean Benton.<br />\nFinally, the Goverance Report is rather<br />\nlong and, in places, perhaps, difficult to<br />\nunderstand. The members of the committee,<br />\nI am sure, will be more than willing to<br />\n,discuss any part of this report or of the<br />\nbackground work that we have done.<br />\nChristopher Beach was 1 of 3 undergraduates on the Summer Governance<br />\nCommittee.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nEDUCATION<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\nThe Sunday Sun contained<br />\nan article this week about a<br />\nnew school being organized in<br />\nBaltimore, a school which<br />\ngrants students a greater<br />\npart and responsibility in<br />\ntheir own education.

But<br />\nthere was a feeling that boss Jack<br />\nPollack had fought very hard to keep<br />\nhis man ahead of the black professor<br />\nfrom Morgan State.<br />\nIn the ghetto areas where Parren<br />\nMitchell had most of his support,<br />\nvoting machines did not work, were<br />\ndelivered late or not at all and<br />\npolling places were shifted at the<br />\nlast minute. Harold Hughes, the<br />\nelection official who is in charge of<br />\nvoting machines,said that it was the<br />\nworst election foul-up in memory.<br />\n\"It's not accidental,\" Mitchell<br />\nclaimed. \"The breakdowns were<br />\nconcentrated in the black areas of<br />\nthe Fifth Legislative District.\"<br />\nOther troubles plagued the<br />\ncounting.<br />\nA private company,<br />\nManpower, Inc., was hired to do the<br />\ncounting, but their people started<br />\nleaving at midnight, so the police<br />\nhad to be called in at the 5th<br />\nRegimental Armory to finish the<br />\njob.

He became state coordinator<br />\nfor Kennedy's campaign, and since<br />\nthen he has cultivated labor and<br />\npeace groups.<br />\nSpeaking with him at his home,<br />\nSarbanes had the hardened<br />\nair of the very ambitious, and he was<br />\ncareful not to say anything wrong.<br />\nWhen pressed on civil liberties, he<br />\nadmitted he voted for Maryland's<br />\npreventive detention law.<br />\nHe didn't seem particularly<br />\nconcerned over the D.C.

Even though the<br />\nmatches are individual, the<br />\n<br />\n-effort is by the team.<br />\nConditioning was also a<br />\nfactor. The men did not<br />\nrecieve pay.

Weiss looked particularly<br />\nimpressive, bringing halfbacks Anay<br />\nSmith and Wes Daub back to help on<br />\ndefense, positioning his fullbacks<br />\nperfectly, and making remarkable<br />\nsaves.<br />\nHis presence in the goal also<br />\nseemed to rally the Hopkins offense,<br />\nwhich scored twice more on Albee<br />\nSamper's third goal of the match,<br />\nand on halfback Ed Coza's first goal<br />\nof the season.<br />\nTough Fullbacks<br />\nIn the fourth quarter, Baltimore<br />\ntried to make the game close,<br />\nscoring twice off substitute goalie,<br />\nBobby La Rosa. But the fullbacks<br />\nhung tough, and got enough help<br />\nfrom Smith, and Coza to close off<br />\nthe rally and preserve the victory.<br />\nAs several players have noted,<br />\nthere is reason to be optimistic this<br />\nyear, since the team has the needed<br />\namount of experience, talent, depth<br />\nand spirit to produce a winning<br />\nseason, barring any serious injuries.<br />\nIf the defense can organize itself,<br />\nand if the offense can produce 1 or 2<br />\ngoals a game, the team may even<br />\ntake it all this season.<br />\n<br />\nCross Country<br />\nProspects for the cross-country<br />\nteam this year are predictably dim.<br />\nWith only three returning varsity<br />\nrunners, the season could again be a<br />\nlong one for the Jay runners. There<br />\nare now only five people out for the<br />\ncross-country team, the minimum<br />\nnumber allowed to enter a meet.<br />\nIf any one member of the team<br />\nshould get sick or quit, Hopkins would<br />\nhave to forfeit a meet.<br />\n<br />\n\f70<br />\n<br />\nSeptember 1 8, 1970<br />\n<br />\nPage 11<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nU.S.P.H.S.

Hollis, Stuart Seidel<br />\nAndrew Green<br />\nJay Lenrow<br /><br />\nClosed Mouth<br />\nDepartment Rule<br />\nThe department is the key to the University, we will<br />\nlearn today while sifting through pages of verbiage from<br />\nthe summer governance committee. And just how do<br />\nHopkins departments work? They debate substantive<br />\nconflicts in terms of procedure and mask their debates<br />\nin secrecy.<br />\nThe most recent example occurred this week in the<br />\nSocial Relations department. Unlike other courses<br />\nwhich are automatically approved by the chairman, the<br />\ndepartment saw fit to review Dr. Chester Wickwire's<br />\nrequest to add two more courses to its paultry offerings<br />\nthis semester. Meeting in privacy, without even the<br />\ncourtesy to allow Dr. Wickwire to defend his program<br />\n(protocol restricts \"part-time lecturers\" from such<br />\ndeliberations), they concluded the courses are inappropriate.<br />\nWickwire was notified in writing of the decision<br />\nyesterday without explanation. When the News-Letter<br />\ntried to find out what had happened, the department<br />\nchairman refused to comment, saying he will only<br />\nanswer written inquiries.<br />\nSo an inkling of what happened to the courses has been<br />\neffectively stifled and with that, the 150 students who<br />\nexpressed interest in the two rejected courses have been<br />\ncheated.<br />\nThe main point, however, is not the numerous obstacles Wickwire has to face in order to develop practical courses in sociology. Rather it is the control<br />\nprofessors exercise, exclusively running \"their\"<br />\ndepartments without any attempt to garner junior<br />\nfaculty or student opinion.<br /><br />\nRight Train...<br />\nWrong Track<br />\nThe Student Council climbed aboard the right train in<br />\nmaking the decision to fight the new discipline code, but<br />\nthe train is on the wrong track. The Council has refused<br />\nto appoint students to man a hearing board, as long as<br />\nthe rules of the game call for approval of the appointees<br />\nby Dean Benton. We applaud their action. But the<br />\nCouncil has also announced plans to spend $5,000 in<br />\nstudent activity funds to hire an attorney to fight the<br />\ncode in court.<br />\nClaiming the code is vague and overbroad, the Council<br />\nwants an injunction barring the University from enforcement.<br />\nNo court in the land will take on a test case involving<br />\nan as yet unenforced code. The lawsuit contemplated by<br />\nthe ten students suspended last summer is a different<br />\nstory. They will seek a court judgement on a discipline<br />\ncase after the fact.<br />\nAs it stands now, we can only regard the proposed SC<br />\nsuit as foolhardy and wasteful. It is time for the SC to<br />\nemerge from its self-imposed hibernation with a drive to<br />\norganize the student body behind the positions of its<br />\nelected officials. The question of tactics is one for the<br />\nstudent body to decide. If students want to work through<br />\nthe new governance channels to fight the code, fine. If<br />\nthey want to take to the \"streets\", then we will have a<br />\ntest case.<br /><br />\nDefending Governance<br />\nBy T. CHRISTOPHER BEACH.<br />\nThe Summer Goverance Committee has<br />\nsubmitted to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts<br />\nand Sciences a report that recommends a<br />\nnew system of governance for this division.<br />\nCopies of the report are now being printed<br />\nand within a few days will be returned and<br />\ndistributed to all members of the division.<br />\nThe committee's conception of how the<br />\ndivision has previously been governed is well<br />\nstated in the introductory chapter of the<br />\nreport.\"An almost universal theme, running<br />\nalike through administration, faculty, and<br />\nstudents, was the perilously high level of<br />\nfrustration over how and where to get things<br />\ndone. Individual grievances and suggestions<br />\nhave not been acted upon or even answered.<br />\n\"Academic and nonacademic programs<br />\nand policies have emerged full grown, like<br />\nBotticelli's Venus, from the depths of administrative silence.\" That silence has<br />\npervaded all levels of this division, from the<br />\nStudent Council's administering of its affairs<br />\nto the \"Administration's\" administering of<br />\neveryone' affairs.<br />\nThe committee did not seek, however, to<br />\naddress its report to specific issues raised or<br />\nspecific decisions made in the past two or<br />\nthree years. Rather, the attempt was to<br />\npropose a new system that clearly defines<br />\nwhere an individual issue may be discussed<br />\nand where a decision made. '<br />\nThe purpose of establishing such a<br />\nsystem is twofold: (1) to guarantee that an<br />\nindividual's opinion on a specific subject<br />\nwould be heard at a point where a decision<br />\ncould be affected and (2) to guarantee that<br />\nthe thought behind his opinion would be<br />\nanswered, if not acted upon.<br />\nRight to Advise<br />\nIn the report, the above guarantees are<br />\ntermed \"the right to advise\" and the right to<br />\nhold accountable those who are advised.\" In<br />\npractice, the guarantees mean that before<br />\nan administrator makes a decision, he must<br />\ninform those groups to be affected by the<br />\ndecision and seek either their advice or the<br />\nadvice of a duly constituted body that<br />\nrepresents them. If such advance is refected<br />\nof modified at the time of the decision, the<br />\nadministrator must explain his decision if<br />\nthe advisory body, or group, so requests.<br />\nBecause Woody Bennett and .Harry<br />\nSingleton, two of the undergraduate<br />\nmembers of the committee, have not signed<br />\nthe majority report and have explained<br />\nthemselves in two separate minority<br />\nreports. I would like to explain why I, the<br />\nthird undergraduate, have endorsed the<br />\nrecommendations of the majority report.<br />\nFlexible System<br />\nIf put into effect, the recommended<br />\nsystem can be amended so that parts of it<br /><br />\nwith which I disagree can be reconsidered<br />\nand perhaps changed. If put into effect, the<br />\nrecommended system will permit any individual or group of individuals who have<br />\nraised a controversial issue to know why<br />\nthey have been accepted or rejected.<br />\nMore specifically, if the Arts and Sciences<br />\nRepresentative Council is established, the<br />\nundergraduates, graduate students,<br />\nresearch staff and faculty will finally have a<br />\nchance to cooperate and, as a single group,<br />\nadvise the Dean. Although some students<br />\nargue that advisory power is no power, I<br />\ncan't agree. As stated in its constitution, the<br />\nAcademic Council had only advisory<br />\npower; yet, the power -Mat our faculty<br />\ngenerates through its Council is as great as<br />\nthe faculty power in any other university in<br />\nthe country.<br />\nDepartment Guidelines<br />\nFurther, the departmental guidelines that<br />\nhave been recommended offer an even more<br />\nsignificant change in governance. If adopted<br />\nand followed, these guidelines offer the<br />\nstudent a much greater chance to determine<br />\nthe course of his education. As, such the<br />\nguidelines are easily the most important<br />\nproposal.<br />\nAt the present moment academic and nonacademic issues are pressing for resolution.<br />\nAlready, controversy over the issues of APL<br />\nand ROTC has begun again. Already, Dean<br />\nCode of Conduct is being<br />\nBenton's<br />\nchallenged. These and other issues require<br />\nextensive discussion and major dicisions of<br />\npolicy. If the discussion is to be 'reasonable<br />\nand the decisions responsible, the proposed<br />\nsystem of governance should be accepted by<br />\nall members of the division.<br />\nBest Alternative<br />\nOur choice is either to accept or reject the<br />\nproposals. If we accept them, we know<br />\nwhat the means are for effecting' student<br />\nvoice. If we reject them we have either no<br />\nmeans, or what is more likely, we have<br />\nmeans determined by the Dean.<br />\nIf our objective is to seek better methods of<br />\neducation and in doing so, to determine<br />\nhow we are to face the issues mentioned<br />\nabove, I would hope that we choose a system<br />\nprososed by a committee of different<br />\nmembers from the community rather than<br />\nchoose no system or a system by one isolated<br />\nadministrator, Dean Benton.<br />\nFinally, the Goverance Report is rather<br />\nlong and, in places, perhaps, difficult to<br />\nunderstand. The members of the committee,<br />\nI am sure, will be more than willing to<br />\n,discuss any part of this report or of the<br />\nbackground work that we have done.<br />\nChristopher Beach was 1 of 3 undergraduates on the Summer Governance<br />\nCommittee.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nEDUCATION<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\nThe Sunday Sun contained<br />\nan article this week about a<br />\nnew school being organized in<br />\nBaltimore, a school which<br />\ngrants students a greater<br />\npart and responsibility in<br />\ntheir own education. This is a<br />\nnew approach to education in<br />\nBaltimore, but is only a part<br />\nof a similar national<br />\nmovement taking hold in<br />\nmany parts of this country.<br />\nAt the same time that the<br />\npeople of Baltimore are<br />\ntaking this step forward, The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University is<br />\ntaking a giant step backward.<br />\nBy the end of this year, the<br />\nUniversity will phase out its<br />\neducation department.

Their<br />\ninjection represents one of<br />\nthe first and most successful<br />\nsyntheses of religious and<br />\nsecular music.<br />\nThe instrumental backing<br />\nis distinctly different from<br />\nchurch compositions antedating it. The use of horns<br />\nwith violins and harpsichords<br />\nrecalls later Baroque compositions.

Weiss looked particularly<br />\nimpressive, bringing halfbacks Anay<br />\nSmith and Wes Daub back to help on<br />\ndefense, positioning his fullbacks<br />\nperfectly, and making remarkable<br />\nsaves.<br />\nHis presence in the goal also<br />\nseemed to rally the Hopkins offense,<br />\nwhich scored twice more on Albee<br />\nSamper's third goal of the match,<br />\nand on halfback Ed Coza's first goal<br />\nof the season.<br />\nTough Fullbacks<br />\nIn the fourth quarter, Baltimore<br />\ntried to make the game close,<br />\nscoring twice off substitute goalie,<br />\nBobby La Rosa.
