BYRNE DOWNING, '28<br />\n<br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS<br />\nAn entirely novel and unique<br />\nmethod has been introduced at<br />\nNew York University in the rehearsal of plays. It provides, essentially, for the installation of microphones on the stage where the<br />\nplay is being rehearsed, which will<br />\nrecord every word spoken by the<br />\nactors and actresses. The record<br />\nwill first be impressed on wax and<br />\nthen a permanent phonograph record will be made.<br />\nIt is said that two great advantages are possessed by this system. First, it will afford the players an opportunity to hear their<br />\nown voices and make their own<br />\ncorrections. The coach will not<br />\nspeak a word while the rehearsal<br />\nis going on, but will wait for .he<br />\npermanent records to be placed on<br />\na phonograph. A still greater advantage, it is said, is the fact that<br />\nafter the performance of the play<br />\nhas been entirely perfected, permanent records may be made and<br />\nfiled for future reference.<br />\n<br />\nStudent actors will soon be able<br />\nto hear, by this method, interpretations which have made great<br />\nroles famous on the stage.

KNIPP & SONS<br />\n<br />\nTHE POOR PROFESSORS<br />\nThe American public has a stock impression of the college<br />\nprofessor which it dislikes to change. In the popular conception all professors are absent-minded, near-sighted, gentle, and<br />\nafflicted with liver complaint. They all wear outlandishly oldfashioned clothes, spectacles, and umbrellas. They are all seventy-five years of age or older.<br />\nA recent article in Collier's gives an example of what the<br />\nmuch-mentioned \"man in the street\" likes to believe of collegiate educators. The coeds of a Southern college had failed an<br />\nintelligence test. The story goes that the test was then given<br />\nto the faculty, who made an even more miserable showing.<br />\nMoral, according to Collier's: All college professors are lacking<br />\nin common sense.<br />\nThe examples quoted as being instances of the faculty's<br />\nworst and most ludicrous blunders were: Al Jolson was said<br />\nto be a wrestling champion; the purposes of Brilliantine were<br />\nconfused; filet mignon was called the name of an opera by Puccini; and Grover Cleveland Bergdoll was said to be a -World<br />\nWar hero.<br />\nWhether familiarity with comedians and patent beautifiers<br />\nis a mark of intelligence might be contested. And of the other<br />\ntwo \"imbecile\" blunders it is just possible that the confusion of<br />\nfood with music was done intentionally by someone who found<br />\nPuccini vapid\u2014for if there isn't an Italian opera called \"Filet<br />\nMignon\" there should be. And plain healthy facetiousness<br />\nrather than failure to keep in touch with the world's progress<br />\nseems the answer to the last example of professorial feeblemindedness.<br />\nThose who still cherish with the illusion that all policemen<br />\nare big-footed Irishmen the belief that all professors have<br />\nchronic stigmatism and disordered livers, might do well to observe the Hopkins faculty, or certain members of it. Not only<br />\nis there an instructor who is a baseball player but there is a<br />\ncertain group among the faculty who romp about at dusk on the<br />\nupper quadrangle like playground children. A man with weak<br />\neyes and a dilapidated liver might conceivably play tennis or<br />\ngolf but free-for-all soccer is a different matter. The American<br />\npublic is invited to watch some seven or eight university professors or near professors clad in \"unmentionables\" chasing a<br />\nsoccer ball with the vim of a high school boy.<br />\n<br />\nThe News-Letter regrets to announce the resignation<br />\nof Arthur L.

BYRNE DOWNING, '28<br /><br />\nINTERCOLLEGIATE NEWS<br />\nAn entirely novel and unique<br />\nmethod has been introduced at<br />\nNew York University in the rehearsal of plays. It provides, essentially, for the installation of microphones on the stage where the<br />\nplay is being rehearsed, which will<br />\nrecord every word spoken by the<br />\nactors and actresses. The record<br />\nwill first be impressed on wax and<br />\nthen a permanent phonograph record will be made.<br />\nIt is said that two great advantages are possessed by this system. First, it will afford the players an opportunity to hear their<br />\nown voices and make their own<br />\ncorrections. The coach will not<br />\nspeak a word while the rehearsal<br />\nis going on, but will wait for .he<br />\npermanent records to be placed on<br />\na phonograph. A still greater advantage, it is said, is the fact that<br />\nafter the performance of the play<br />\nhas been entirely perfected, permanent records may be made and<br />\nfiled for future reference.<br /><br />\nStudent actors will soon be able<br />\nto hear, by this method, interpretations which have made great<br />\nroles famous on the stage.

KNIPP &amp; SONS<br /><br />\nTHE POOR PROFESSORS<br />\nThe American public has a stock impression of the college<br />\nprofessor which it dislikes to change. In the popular conception all professors are absent-minded, near-sighted, gentle, and<br />\nafflicted with liver complaint. They all wear outlandishly oldfashioned clothes, spectacles, and umbrellas. They are all seventy-five years of age or older.<br />\nA recent article in Collier's gives an example of what the<br />\nmuch-mentioned \"man in the street\" likes to believe of collegiate educators. The coeds of a Southern college had failed an<br />\nintelligence test. The story goes that the test was then given<br />\nto the faculty, who made an even more miserable showing.<br />\nMoral, according to Collier's: All college professors are lacking<br />\nin common sense.<br />\nThe examples quoted as being instances of the faculty's<br />\nworst and most ludicrous blunders were: Al Jolson was said<br />\nto be a wrestling champion; the purposes of Brilliantine were<br />\nconfused; filet mignon was called the name of an opera by Puccini; and Grover Cleveland Bergdoll was said to be a -World<br />\nWar hero.<br />\nWhether familiarity with comedians and patent beautifiers<br />\nis a mark of intelligence might be contested. And of the other<br />\ntwo \"imbecile\" blunders it is just possible that the confusion of<br />\nfood with music was done intentionally by someone who found<br />\nPuccini vapid\u2014for if there isn't an Italian opera called \"Filet<br />\nMignon\" there should be. And plain healthy facetiousness<br />\nrather than failure to keep in touch with the world's progress<br />\nseems the answer to the last example of professorial feeblemindedness.<br />\nThose who still cherish with the illusion that all policemen<br />\nare big-footed Irishmen the belief that all professors have<br />\nchronic stigmatism and disordered livers, might do well to observe the Hopkins faculty, or certain members of it. Not only<br />\nis there an instructor who is a baseball player but there is a<br />\ncertain group among the faculty who romp about at dusk on the<br />\nupper quadrangle like playground children. A man with weak<br />\neyes and a dilapidated liver might conceivably play tennis or<br />\ngolf but free-for-all soccer is a different matter. The American<br />\npublic is invited to watch some seven or eight university professors or near professors clad in \"unmentionables\" chasing a<br />\nsoccer ball with the vim of a high school boy.<br /><br />\nThe News-Letter regrets to announce the resignation<br />\nof Arthur L.
