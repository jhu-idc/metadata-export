However WJHU<br />\ngeneral manager David Creagh<br />\ntold him the FCC has been<br />\n\"dragging their feet\" in processing the station's reapplication and the 25,000 watt station<br />\nmay not be operating until this<br />\nfall.<br />\n\"He pleaded with us to continue broadcasting over the<br />\nsummer,\" added Oehlkers. \"It<br />\nseems at this point that once we<br />\ngo down, we'll come back<br />\nsometime this summer as a contingency until fall when we can<br />\nwork out this AM plan.

At the risk<br />\nof sounding childish: We told you so.<br />\nFor a brief time, of course, the fair<br />\ndate was in fact switched to May 2-4. A<br />\nhome lacrosse game was scheduled for<br />\nthat weekend, but the powers that be<br />\ndecided they could work around that,<br />\nparticularly if it was the only way to save<br />\nthe fair. When that change was announced, however, the Math Department raised a hue and cry, pointing out that it had<br />\nalready rescheduled a conference<br />\noriginally slated for April 11-13. The<br />\nirony of the whole thing is that the math<br />\nconference was rescheduled for May 2-4,<br />\nso the fair ended up with the weekend<br />\nthe math department really wanted, and<br />\nvice versa.<br />\nAt the time, we didn't have much to<br />\nsay about the switch. For one thing, it<br />\noccured during the Christmas vacation,<br />\nand so was a fait accompli by the time<br />\nstudents returned.(No doubt that was a<br />\nhappy coincidence for the administration.) Still, we're not positive (read<br />\ncarefully\u2014positive) that the math con-<br />\n<br />\nference and the fair couldn't peacefully<br />\ncoexist. We didn't dig into the matter<br />\ndeeply at the time since it seemed to do<br />\nso would have been futile; now we wish<br />\nwe had.<br />\nAs everyone knows, the fair was essentially rained out. Friday (always a slow<br />\nday anyway) was miserable, Saturday<br />\nwas reasonalbe (not great) and Sunday<br />\nwas somewhere in between. The net effect was a dramatic drop in attendance.<br />\nThe key thing now, though, is not to<br />\nbemoan the weather (which, after all, is<br />\nhardly anyone's fault), but to insure that<br />\nthere are no more scheduling screw-ups<br />\nin the future. When all the fuss over this<br />\nyear's date was going on in January,<br />\nAssociate Dean of Students Chris Colombo said a University calendar was being established which would eliminate<br />\nsuch conflicts in the future. We hope so,<br />\nbut considering that we can't remember<br />\na year when scheduling the fair wasn't<br />\na problem, we're not optimistic. Promises that setting a fair date will soon be<br />\neasy strike us about like promises that<br />\nWJHU will get its power increase soon,<br />\nthat teaching will matter in tenure decisions and that hell will freeze over.<br />\nPerhaps this fair's problems were in<br />\nfact unavoidable. They were certainly a<br />\npity. The test now is to see that next year<br />\na more reasonable date can be found.<br />\n<br />\nA Quality Debate<br />\nThe Coalition for a Free South Africa<br />\nsaid recently it hopes the quality of antidivestment rhetoric will rise. We agree.<br />\nBut we'd also like to see the .Coalition<br />\ntake a little of its own medicine.<br />\nQuite simply, the quality of the debate<br />\nsurrounding the South African investment issue has declined sharply. Both<br />\nsides now seem to imply\u2014if not say<br />\nexplicitly\u2014that anyone who disagrees<br />\nwith them is automatically unreasonable,<br />\nsilly and motivated by ignoble concerns.<br />\nAnd it's clear that both groups have used, to say the least, deceptive arguments.<br />\nFirst, a few examples of the latter:<br />\nJeff Lurie, then the president of the<br />\nCollege Republicans, said recently in a<br />\nletter to the editor of this newspaper that<br />\nAngola was guilty of human rights violations worse than those caused by apartheid, \"as documented by Amnesty International.\" Not quite. The fact is<br />\nAmnesty International, as one of its local<br />\nleaders points out in a letter this week,<br />\ndoes not compare countries.<br />\nPatrick Bond and Theo Nkone, to<br />\nleading members of the pro-divestment<br />\ncamp, recently backed up their criticisms<br />\nof Inkatha (a South African antidivestment organization) by writing,<br />\n\"See the New York Times front page article of March 31 where Inkatha is<br />\ndescribed as a `facist organization.' and<br />\n'wholly in league' with the white<br />\nauthorities.\" Well, sort of. The Times<br />\nwas actually quoting a committee of Inkatha opponents. To omit that fact<br />\n<br />\nmakes it sound as if it was the impartial<br />\njudgment of the newspaper that Inkatha<br />\nis \"facist.\" (The truth is that the Times<br />\nalso said Buthelezi is \"opposed to apartheid.\") Why didn't Bond and Nkone<br />\nproperly attribute the quote?<br />\nBut at least as worrisome as the deceptions and half-truths is the tenor of the<br />\ndebate in the last few weeks. The Coalition said recently, for example, that \"any<br />\nobjective observer\" (emphasis added)<br />\nwill conclude that Gatsha Buthelezi, the<br />\nleader of Inkatha, is a \"stooge\" of the<br />\nSouth African government. The Students<br />\nfor Inkatha, on the other hand, have said<br />\nthat to suggest such a thing is an \"utter<br />\nabsurdity\" that can be seen by \"anyone<br />\nwho has even a cursory knowledge of<br />\nButhelezi's political background.\" Well,<br />\nit can't be seen (as pointed out above)<br />\nby a committee of politically active South<br />\nAfricans. As for the Coalition's argument, nothing can be seen by any objecIke observer.<br />\nWe understand that all of these<br />\norganizations are arguing for things in<br />\nwhich they sincerely believe. We aren't<br />\nso naive as to expect either side to use<br />\nkid gloves.<br />\nBut we do expect them to respect each<br />\nother. They can at least admit the other<br />\nguys are knowledgeable (both groups<br />\nclearly are), thoughtful and sincere\u2014but<br />\nstill claim they're just dead wrong. If that<br />\nhappens, the Coalition will get its<br />\nwish\u2014the quality of the debate will rise.<br />\nOn both sides, let's hope.<br />\n<br />\nOver the past several weeks,<br />\nthe Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica has attempted to coerce<br />\nthe University's divestment<br />\nfrom companies_ that do<br />\nbusiness in South Africa. In<br />\ntheir zealous pursuit of their<br />\ngoal, coalition members<br />\nadopted a double standard:<br />\nwhile they avidly condemn<br />\napartheid (as we all do), they ignore equal, if not greater,<br />\ncrimes and atrocities committed<br />\nby the Soviet Union and its<br />\nclient regimes.

To<br />\nbalance this, the university<br />\nshould also fund a religiouspolitical office (i.e. as I stated<br />\nin my letter, an on-campus<br />\nMoral Majority) that espouses<br />\nright-wing views since, as<br />\nGinsborg points out, the<br />\nuniversity perhaps should<br />\n\"fund equally student groups<br />\nwith different political agendas.\" It is clear, though, that<br />\nmost students would object to<br />\nhaving the college fund a proFalwell Chaplain's Office to<br />\ncounter the present Office of<br />\nthe Chaplain.<br />\nAs for my use of the phrase<br />\n\"left-of-center,\" I do not feel<br />\nthat it is an \"obnoxious\" or<br />\n\"frivolous\" description. On the<br />\ncontrary, it is a quite useful way<br />\nof summarizing, in a nutshell,<br />\nthe general tone of the Office of<br />\nthe Chaplain (indeed, Ginsborg<br />\ndoes not try to refute this<br />\ncharge\u2014he simply calls it<br />\n\"frivolous\"). \"Left of the leftof-center\" is also a good way to<br />\ndistinguish, for example, European Socialist Parties from the<br />\nU.S. Democratic Party (which<br />\nis left-of-center).<br />\nMost of the activities of the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain do not<br />\ngreatly \"distress\" me. What<br />\nprovoked me to write my letter<br />\nwas its providing busing for the<br />\nNational March for Women's<br />\nLives. The idea of a march supporting the continued legalization of the murder of the unborn is sick.

As a matter of<br />\nprinciple, Amnesty International never engages in comparisons between countries or<br />\nbetween successive governments as to which has a<br />\n\"worse\" record of human<br />\nrights violations. The organization investigates human rights<br />\nabuses in a strictly impartial<br />\nfashion, and it does not work<br />\nfor or against governments, but<br />\napplies a single universal standard to all countries regardless<br />\nof the ideology of the government or the views of its victims.<br />\nTo suggest, as Lurie does, that<br />\nAmnesty International has<br />\nclaimed that Angola has a<br />\nworse human rights record than<br />\nSouth Africa, is an attempt to<br />\nuse th prestige of Amnesty International to further partisan<br />\npolitical views in a way that<br />\nsubverts its authority and<br />\nmisleads readers who may not<br />\nbe familiar with Amnesty's<br />\nposition.<br />\nIn fact, Amnesty International has documented human<br />\nrights problems in both Angola<br />\nand South Africa.

Unfortunately, the international dinner planned for<br />\nApril 19th has been cancelled.<br />\nA questionnaire went out in<br />\nlate February to allow students<br />\nto sign up for these events. As<br />\nmost of them are limited to<br />\nsmall groups, places were<br />\nassigned on a first-come, first-<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\nserved basis. Several events<br />\nhave been held already, and<br />\nseem to have gone well, judging from the reactions of faculty hosts and students alike.<br />\nGunther Anderson and Patty Kwon spent Saturday, April<br />\n5th at the Impressionist exhibit<br />\nat the National Gallery of Art<br />\nin Washington. The line for<br />\ntickets stretched around the<br />\nbuilding and down the street,<br />\nbut the Hopkins students had<br />\nreceived their tickets in advance. Finding that they had<br />\ntwo extra, Anderson said,\"We<br />\ngave them to an old couple at<br />\nthe end of the ticket line. The<br />\npeople in front of them got<br />\npretty miffed.\" They enjoyed<br />\nthe exhibit very much. Their<br />\nhost was Dr. David Hult,<br />\nDepartment of French, who<br />\ncame for the same thing we<br />\ndid,\u2014 said Anderson, \"he<br />\nwanted to see the paintings.<br />\nHe's a professor of French<br />\nliterature, not of French art.<br />\nWe didn't learn a lot about<br />\nFrench Impressionism, but we<br />\nlearned plenty about how to<br />\nfind a place to live in Charles<br />\nVillage, and we learned he's a<br />\nnice guy.\" That, after all, was<br />\nthe point of the trip.<br />\nDr. Y. C. Lee of the Department of Biology was not quite<br />\nso pleased with the chamber<br />\n<br />\nmusic group he and his wife<br />\nsponsored at their house. Apparently only two of the<br />\nstudents on the list for that<br />\nevent showed up, but \"there<br />\nhad been some informal interactions in the meantime, and<br />\nother students came, so it ended well,\" said Lee.<br />\nOn Friday, April 11, six<br />\nstudents got a long-awaited<br />\nbreak from ARA food when<br />\nthey went to Louie's Bookstore<br />\nand Cafe, followed by an evening at the Baltimore Symphony<br />\nOrchestra. Sonia Marx was enthusiastic about the event. The<br />\nfood was good. The music was<br />\nan unusual mixture of styles,<br />\nfeaturing classical composers<br />\nlike Bizet and Sibelius in the<br />\nfirst half and show music, from<br />\nGershwin's Porgy and Bess, to<br />\nE.T., after intermission. Dr.<br />\nSidney Mintz, of the Anthropology Department and his<br />\nwife received rave reviews.<br />\n\"They were neat,\" said Marx;<br />\n\"Dr. Mintz and his wife said<br />\nthey come to the symphony<br />\nalmost every Friday night to<br />\ncelebrate the fact that he<br />\ndoesn't have to teach the next<br />\nday.\"<br />\nDr. Mintz enjoyed the evening as well. \"The students were<br />\ngreat. We had fun, and I would<br />\ngladly do it again,\" he said. He<br />\n<br />\nhad some suggestions for improving the program such as arranging a system in which the<br />\ngroups could meet more than<br />\nonce. \"It's fun,\" he said, \"but<br />\nit's almost like a first date, with<br />\neverybody on their very best<br />\nbehavior and not much time to<br />\nget to know each other. If the<br />\nschool really wants to foster<br />\nstudent-faculty interaction, the<br />\nbest and least expensive way to<br />\ndo it is over lunch.\" Citing his<br />\nexperience at Yale, where faculty<br />\nand<br />\nundergraduates<br />\nhabitually eat together under<br />\nthe college system, Dr. Mintz<br />\nencouraged faculty-student<br />\nmeals as the ideal way to promote interaction on a regular<br />\nbasis. Hmm, if the professors<br />\nstarted eating at ARA, would<br />\nthe quality go up?<br />\nAt any rate, the present program seems to be well-liked.<br />\nBoth students and professors<br />\nsaid they would probably say<br />\nhello if they ran into each other<br />\nin the hall, and everyone<br />\nrecommended the program to<br />\ninterested students next year. If<br />\nthe remaining four events go as<br />\nwell as the preceeding ones, the<br />\n1986 Student-Faculty Interaction Program will have been a<br />\nbig success.<br />\n<br />\nGood Impressions of a Museum Trip<br />\nby Elissa Mittman<br />\nEspecially since I don't have<br />\na car at Hopkins, I jumped at<br />\na chance to get away from campus. The student-faculty trip to<br />\nthe Impressionism exhibit at the<br />\nNational Art Gallery in<br />\nWashington, DC, with David<br />\nHuh of the French Department<br />\nprovided just the escape and a<br />\ngreat break from studying.<br />\nHow often does one get the opportunity to spend a day in DC<br />\n(without paying a cent) and to<br />\nparticipate in something<br />\nculturally-oriented? Transportation, a box lunch (which was<br />\nsurprisingly good), and admission tickets and an accompanying headset to the exhibit were<br />\nall included in the day's outing.<br />\nThe mixture of people in our<br />\ngroup amazed me the most.<br />\nFirst of all, I expected plenty of<br />\nArt History and Humanities<br />\nmajors. Secondly, I figured an<br />\nart exhibition trip would probably attract mostly females.<br />\nWell, to say the let, I was proven wrong on both accounts.<br />\nThe majority of people were<br />\nBMEs, Electrical Engineers,<br />\nand Pre-meds. There was only<br />\none IR major and me, a<br />\nHumanities Area major. Out of<br />\nour group of eleven people, only three were females. Once<br />\nagain; the Hopkins ratio<br />\nstrikes! The group spanned all<br />\nclasses and few people knew<br />\neach other ahead of time. We<br />\nall got acquainted with each<br />\nother and our supervisor, Hult,<br />\non the bus ride down and over<br />\nlunch. By the end of the day,<br />\n<br />\nwe were all comparing our impressions ot the exninit anu oui<br />\nmuseum shop purchases.<br />\nAlthough most of us wandered alone through the exhibit,<br />\nwe would frequently stop and<br />\nchat with another member of<br />\nour party. \"The New PaintingImpressionism\" exhibition produced a wide display of canvases that were thoroughly appealing. The exhibit centered on<br />\nthe the eight pioneering independent exhibitions of Impressionist artists from<br />\n1874-1886. Paintings, drawings, and sculptures from such<br />\ndiverse artists as Cezanne,<br />\nDegas, Monet, Gaugin, and<br />\nSerrat were displayed. The exhibition's systematic format,<br />\nbeginning in 1874 and ending in<br />\n1886, showed how concepts of<br />\nlight and color progressed and<br />\ndeveloped over the years. The<br />\naccompanying taped explanation provided informative<br />\nbackground material for us artistic novices.<br />\nAfter a quick walk through<br />\nthe museum shop, it was time<br />\nto leave. My one complaint was<br />\nthat I would've liked to stay<br />\nlonger at the museum to see<br />\nother exhibits.<br />\nStudents should definitely<br />\nmake the time and effort to be<br />\ninvolved in the Student-Faculty<br />\nInteraction Program. Don't be<br />\ndiscouraged if you're on the<br />\nwaiting list for a trip. I was the<br />\ntenth alternate and got the opportunity to go. The program<br />\nenables students and faculty<br />\nmembers to relate to each other<br />\non a non-academic level as well<br />\n<br />\nas offering a break from campus surroundings.

Watching chess<br />\nwas never what I would consider an exciting way to spend<br />\nan evening. I am pleased to say<br />\nthat I was wrong.<br />\nThe Chess Club, and many<br />\nchessophiles from around the<br />\nstate were fortunate enough to<br />\nwitness an exhibition of<br />\nsimultaneous chess, as played<br />\nby Danish Grandmaster Bent<br />\nLarsen, last Friday in the Glass<br />\nPavilion.<br />\nLarsen's credentials are certainly impressive. From<br />\n1967-1968, he set a record for<br />\nconsecutive victories, winning<br />\neleven major tournaments in<br />\n<br />\nBobby Fisher.<br />\nAs a man, Bent Larsen is<br />\nquite articulate, personable,<br />\nand witty. Reports had been<br />\nthat Larsen was an egotist, but<br />\nI found nothing to evidence this<br />\nclaim. He was more than happy to field questions, autograph<br />\nchess boards, and talk to<br />\nanyone individually before and<br />\nafter the exhibition. In fact, the<br />\nquestion and answer period had<br />\nto be cut short by Hopkins<br />\nChess Club president Joel<br />\nSalman, as it had already run<br />\nmore than an hour.<br />\nFor those of you unfamiliar<br />\nwith simultaneous chess, one<br />\nplayer (in this case Mr. Larsen)<br />\nwalks from one board to the<br />\nnext as each player makes his<br />\nmove or countermove (depending on who's playing white).<br />\n<br />\nsuccession. He was called the<br />\nstrongest non-Russian in chess.<br />\nIn 1970, Larsen played board<br />\none in a U.S.S.R. versus the<br />\nrest-of-the-world match. Three<br />\ntimes he was a contender for<br />\nthe world championship, but<br />\nperhaps he is best known for his<br />\n1971 victory over chess legend<br />\n<br />\nIn this exhibition, Mr. Larsen<br />\nfaced twenty-four players,<br />\nfourteen of them being<br />\nHopkins students. The Danish<br />\nGrandmaster ended up winning<br />\ntwenty-one, losing two, and<br />\ndrawing one: The only two to<br />\ndefeat him Were Robert Smith,<br />\nwho is affiliated with the Space<br />\n<br />\nby Jeffrey S. Yager<br />\n<br />\nTelescope Institute, and Troy<br />\nRoberts.<br />\nThe draw went to Hopkins<br />\nsophmore Prabhu Raju.<br />\nMr. Larsen's style was quite<br />\ndynamic. He is unpredictable,<br />\nyet at the same time<br />\nmethodical. He is,. very<br />\naggressive, and is not afraid to<br />\ntake a risk or two. All in all, ne<br />\nis exciting, yes I said, exciting<br />\nto watch.<br />\nBent Larsen comes to<br />\nHopkins after an appearance in<br />\nthe New York Open, where he<br />\ndid not fare particularly well.<br />\nHe was the highest ranked<br />\nplayer in the international class,<br />\nand attributed his disappointing<br />\nperformance to flying directly<br />\nover from the London Open.<br />\nStill, his mood was good.<br />\nMr. Larsen's fee was twentyfive dollars a board, though<br />\nHopkins students payed only<br />\nseven.

It would have<br />\nbeen difficult for the Fine Arts<br />\nCommittee to judge the works<br />\nin a completely unbiased man-<br />\n<br />\nner since some of its members<br />\nare contributing to the show. If<br />\nstudents voted, the result<br />\nwouldn't be right,because comparing different styles of art is<br />\nlike comparing apples and<br />\noranges. Finally, the Committee felt that the prize wouldn't<br />\ncreate that much of an incentive<br />\nfor participation.

To<br />\nput it simply, Goudy was just<br />\nplain outstanding at the plate,<br />\ngoing 5 for 5 on the day, scoring 2 runs while driving in 3.<br />\nIt's the manner in which Goudy<br />\nwent 5 for 5 that's the outstanding part, however. He hit the<br />\ncycle\u2014a single, a double, a triple, and a homerun, and he<br />\nadded another homer on top of<br />\nthat, a two-run blast in the first<br />\nhalf of the ninth that proved to<br />\nbe the game winner. If this were<br />\na fourth of July party, no one<br />\nwould be disappointed; Mike<br />\nKevin Thomas Tully<br />\nGoudy supplied all the<br />\nwho have losi bin<br />\nfireworks.<br />\nThe game began rather quiet-<br />\n<br />\n' ly for the visiting Blue Jays,<br />\n(who made the long three hour<br />\ntrek to the Eastern Shore the<br />\nday after completing a<br />\ndoubleheader at home versus<br />\nWashington College). They<br />\nwere tired, and it showed.<br />\nHopkins went down pretty<br />\nmuch in the first two innings,<br />\nwith Goudy (who else) managing the only hit, a single to left<br />\nfield. Sophomore right-hander<br />\nDave Psenicska surrendered a<br />\nrun on three successive singles<br />\nin the bottom of the 2nd to put<br />\nHopkins down I-0. In the 3rd,<br />\nHopkins tied the score on<br />\nGoudy's solo homer over the<br />\nleft center-field fence, his second of the season. After a<br />\nscoreless 4th inning by both<br />\nclubs, the Jays put two more on<br />\nthe board in the top of the 5th<br />\nby way of Senior tri-captain<br />\nScotty Burns' mammoth 425<br />\nfeet, two-run shot over the left<br />\nfield wall. Burns hit the ball so<br />\nlong and so hard that he stood<br />\n<br />\nat home plate a la Reggie<br />\nJackson to watch it sail out of<br />\nthe ballpark, before beginning<br />\nhis homerun trot. Said Burns,<br />\n\"I always wanted to do that,<br />\n[stand and watch a ball go over<br />\nthe fence after I hit it] so I did.\"<br />\nWell put, Reggie.<br />\nSalisbury refused to die,<br />\nhowever and added three in the<br />\nbottom of the eighth to tie the<br />\ngame at 4 runs apiece. In the<br />\n9th, shortstop Ned Offit led off<br />\nwith a single and Mike Goudy<br />\nbrought home the winning runs<br />\nwith his second round-tripper<br />\nof the game to give Hopkins a<br />\nlead they wouldn't relinquish,<br />\n6-4. Burns later scored on a<br />\nwild pitch after reaching base<br />\nand a'double to extend the Blue<br />\nJay lead to 7-4, and Salisbury<br />\nadded another run in their last<br />\nat bats to make the final 7-5.<br />\nOne day earlier, Hopkins<br />\ntook two games from<br />\nContinued on Page 27<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nBUY TWO CASES OF MILLER HIGH LIFE<br />\nAND GET ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE<br />\nCBS RECORDS OR TAPES FREE.<br />\nBuy Miller High Life and you can get the hottest<br />\nalbum or tape by one of your favorite CBS artists.<br />\nStars like Kenny Loggins.

Washington<br />\nbattled back to within two runs<br />\nafter touching winning pitcher<br />\nPeter Blohm (6-0) for a couple<br />\nin the 6th inning. But Hopkins<br />\nproved to be much too strong<br />\nand outlasted the Shoremen<br />\n5-4. Blohm pitched seven innings and recorded 10 strikeouts<br />\nto increase his team lead to an<br />\nincredible 47 K's in 472/3<br />\ninnings.<br />\nIn the Game 2 laugher,<br />\nHopkins seemed to do no<br />\nwrong, apparently wanting and<br />\nultimately receiving revenge<br />\nagainst Washington for making<br />\nthe first contest so close. The<br />\nJays batted around twice in the<br />\nfirst inning alone, and thus the<br />\n<br />\nstarters were given time off in<br />\nthe 2nd inning to go and enjoy<br />\nthe sights of Spring Fair, while<br />\ntheir subs finished the game.<br />\nFifteen runs were scored in the<br />\nmarathon 1st inning; everyone<br />\nscored at least one, and Burns<br />\nand Raedle each were 2 for 2<br />\nwith \"The Rock\" collecting 4<br />\nRBI's in the inning alone. Some<br />\nfine individual performances<br />\nwere put on by the Blue Jay<br />\nbench, including Freshman<br />\nDan Durocher who went 2 for<br />\n2 and Junior Joe DeRosa, who<br />\nin a rare game appearance, just<br />\nmissed a diving circus catch in<br />\nleft field during the 6th inning.<br />\nin an attempt to save a shut out<br />\nfor winning pitcher Mark<br />\nCampbell (8-1). Campbell pitched seven innings and struck 1<br />\nout eight, lowering his team<br />\nand nationally ranked ERA to<br />\n1.24.<br />\nDiamond Dust: Hopkins'<br />\nrecord now stands at 22 and 1<br />\nwith no apparent end in sight.<br />\nThe Blue Jays just kecp on winning and they're winning big<br />\n<br />\nthese days. Leading the Black<br />\nand Blue Bat',are Jim Hobensack (.483) and Scotty Burns<br />\n(.465). Burns, who recently<br />\nreturned to the lineup after a<br />\nknee injury, is 5 for 5 in his 5<br />\nat bats and has reached base 7<br />\nout of his last 7 plate appearances. Burns also is tied<br />\nwith Goudy for the home run<br />\nlead with 3. Blue Jay fans may<br />\nfinally get a chance to see \"The<br />\nNatural\" Chris Wasson on the<br />\nmound, as they play five games<br />\nin the next 'three days.<br />\nSophomore left-hander Brian<br />\nMurphr has practiced this week<br />\nand may be able to throw as<br />\nearly as next week, depending<br />\non how he progresses. Wednesda,r's game versus UMBC was<br />\nrained out and will be played at<br />\na later date. Next home action<br />\nfor Hopkins is today at 3 p.m.<br />\nversus Franklin and Marshall<br />\nand a doubleheader Sunday,<br />\nbeginning at 1 p.m. against<br />\nYork College.'<br />\n<br />\nGolfers Get Whacked<br />\nby Steven Schiller<br />\nThe golf team lost three matches in the past week to Gettysburg, the University of<br />\nDelaware, and York College.<br />\nThe team record has dropped to<br />\n0 and 6 but the team is playing<br />\nmuch better.<br />\nThe contest against Gettysburg was extremely close in<br />\nevery match. The final result,<br />\nthough, was a disappointing<br />\nloss by only one stroke. Jon<br />\nAbrahams led the team in the<br />\nnumber one spot and tied his<br />\nopponent with a score of 85.<br />\nMarc Koren shot a helpful 90.<br />\nSteven Schiller played number<br />\nthree and shot a 92 to his opponents 97. John Savitz had a<br />\ngreat round for the Whackers<br />\nwith a 94 and John Thompson<br />\nrounded out the Jays effort<br />\nwith a 97. But when all the<br />\nscores were tallied, the Hopkins<br />\ntotal fell one stroke short.<br />\nAgainst Delaware, the team<br />\nwas fighting a losing battle even<br />\nbefore the first hole because<br />\ntheir opponents are tops in division 1 golf. The Jays lost by<br />\nover 40 strokes but they still<br />\nplayed extremely well. Charlie<br />\nDigby played a great match,<br />\nshooting a personal season low<br />\nand tieing his opponent, with<br />\nan 84. Other scores from the<br />\nmatch included an 85 by John<br />\nAbrahams, a 95 by Todd<br />\nStefan and a 92 by Marc Koren.<br />\nJohn Savitz was asked to comment on the team's play, and<br />\n<br />\nevin<br />\n<br />\nDan Landolphi settles under a lb hall in deep right.<br />\n<br />\nFINDING AN APARTMENT<br />\nIN MANHATTAN TAKES<br />\nTHE RIGHT EDUCATION<br />\n<br />\nsaid,\"We played a great defensive match which can be seen in<br />\nDelaware's shot total [their five<br />\nman total was over 400 for the<br />\nfirst time this season].\"<br />\nIn the match against York,<br />\nHopkins played well again but<br />\nsome clutch scores by the<br />\nnumber 6 and 7 men for York<br />\nled to another defeat. Jon<br />\nAbrahams played well as usual,<br />\nshooting a 78. Bill Marquardt<br />\nwas back in the lineup after suffering a Spring Fair injury. He<br />\nshot an impressive 82. Todd<br />\nStefan was back in form with<br />\nan 84 and Charlie Digby held<br />\nup his end with an 86. The final<br />\nqualifying score for the<br />\nWhackers came from Marc<br />\nKoren with a 92. This stroke<br />\ntotal of 422 was clearly a season<br />\nbest and has psyched the team<br />\nup for the MAC's.<br />\nCoach O'Donnell was asked<br />\nto explain the team losses<br />\ndespite their improving scores.<br />\nHe said, \"Last season's captain, Ashu Handa, had promised to fly in from Bologna to try<br />\nand help the team effort, but he<br />\napparently missed the plane<br />\nand disappointed his teammates. This disappointment has<br />\ndepressed the team and has effected their performance, but<br />\nthe team is slowly getting over<br />\nthis heartbreak and is expected<br />\nto do extremely well at the<br />\nMAC's.\" Clearly, the golfers<br />\nare an emotional team so if they<br />\npull themselves together, there<br />\nwill be no stopping them.<br />\n<br />\nGet a free copy of \"Manhattan Moves\"\u2014<br />\nthe insider's guide to finding an affordable<br />\napartment in Manhattan.<br />\nTo welcome potential new<br />\nresidents to the city, and dispel<br />\nsome myths about housing in<br />\nNew York, we have published a<br />\nbook called \"Manhattan Moves\".<br />\nIt's the ultimate insider's guide<br />\nto apartment hunting in the<br />\nBig Apple.<br />\n\"Manhattan Moves\" helps<br />\nyou set your sights on the right<br />\ntype of apartment and location.

The actual<br />\nresolution which the council<br />\npassed last week advocated<br />\ntotal divestment.<br />\n\"Apparently, the resolution<br />\nwas either misrepresented or<br />\nmisunderstood by the PIIAC<br />\nchairperson [who submitted it<br />\nto the Trustees],\" said Senior<br />\nClass President Paul Donio,<br />\nwho attended the Trustee<br />\nmeeting along with Junior<br />\nClass Representative Winston<br />\nVaughan as representatives of<br />\ncouncil.<br />\nThe problem with the definition began at the April 9 PIIAC<br />\nmeeting, when the original<br />\ndefinition discussed, which was<br />\nprinted in last week's NewsLetter, was determined to be<br />\n\"too vague,\" according to<br />\nCouncil PIIAC representative<br />\nBrad Marks.<br />\nPIIAC amended the resolution to specify South Africa<br />\nrelated stocks as those \"that are<br />\nlisted by the Sullivan Principles<br />\nreports or the reports of the Investor Responsibility Research<br />\nCenter (IRRC) as operating in<br />\nSouth Africa,[as well as] companies that continue to make<br />\nnew loans to the South African<br />\ngovernment.\"<br />\nThe intent of this change was<br />\nto provide a list of companies<br />\nto the University's investment<br />\nmanagement committee which<br />\nPIIAC believed would constitute total divestment, said<br />\nMarks. This amendment was<br />\nincorrectly presented on the<br />\nfinal draft which was submitted<br />\nto the Board.<br />\nTo add to the confusion,<br />\ncouncil members did not have<br />\na written copy of the resolution<br />\nbefore them when the issue was<br />\ncalled to vote last week. Donio<br />\nand Vaughan also did not have<br />\na final draft of the resolution<br />\nwhen they appeared before the<br />\nTrustees on Monday.<br />\nCommenting on the lack of<br />\nwritten copies of the resolution,<br />\nDonio said, \"There's some<br />\nkind of communication gap on<br /><br />\ncouncil. All I had in front of me<br />\nwas the text of the News-Letter<br />\narticle.\" Unfortunately, the<br />\ncopy of the resolution which<br />\nwas released to the News-Letter<br />\nand which was printed in last<br />\nweek's article included the<br />\noriginal unamended version of<br />\nthe definition of South Africa<br />\nrelated stock and not the version actually passed.<br />\nThe incorrect version, which<br />\nMuller and the Trustees saw,<br />\nincluded in the definition of<br />\nSouth Africa related stock<br />\n\"companies that are listed by<br />\nthe Sullivan Principles reports<br />\nor the reports of the Investor<br />\nResponsibility Research Center<br />\n(IRRC).. .but which are not<br />\nsignatories or endorsers of the<br />\nSullivan Principles, or are<br />\nsignatories classed as Category<br />\nIIIB (not meeting basic re-<br /><br />\nSouth<br />\nAfrica<br />\nquirements) or Category IIIC<br />\n(not reporting).\"<br />\n\"The definition as worded<br />\nwould misrepresent the intent<br />\nof our resolution,\" explained<br />\nMarks. \"The Trustees' argument was that the resolution<br />\nthey hald before them defined<br />\nSouth Africa related compainies as those that did not<br />\nsign the Sullivan Principles.<br />\nThe confusion became apparent to everyone as soon as<br />\nthe resolution was read.\"<br />\nCouncil members said that<br />\nthey still support the total<br />\ndivestment resolution which<br />\nwas passed last week and have<br />\ndecided to send Muller a letter<br />\nto clarify the council's position.<br />\nAlso at the council meeting:<br />\n\u2022Current programming<br />\ndirector of the ten watt, student<br />\nrun WJHU, Peter Oehlkers,<br />\nannounced to council that a<br />\nsurvey will be distributed to<br />\nstudents next week concerning<br />\nthe future of a student radio<br />\nstation at Hopkins.<br />\nThe text of the survey, which<br />\nhas not yet been finalized, is<br />\ncurrently being reviewed by<br />\nDean of Administration Robert<br />\nWelch to insure that it fairly<br />\nrepresents the adminstration's<br />\nviews and that it will generate<br />\nscientifically valid results, according to Oehlkers.<br />\n\"Welch had some reservations with the current survey,\"<br />\nexplained the Oehlkers, who<br />\nclaims that Welch wants the<br />\ncost of a new student station<br />\nmade clear to students. \"What<br />\nmoney is spent on a student<br />\nradio station will have to be<br />\nsacrificed from some other<br />\nplace,\" he said.<br />\nAccording to Oehlkers, the<br />\ncost of an AM carrier station<br />\nwould be several thousand<br />\ndollars per year to operate and<br />\nmaintain. \"The money issue is<br />\nstill significant. It must be<br />\ndemonstrated that the radio<br />\nstation is a top priority of the<br />\nstudents before these funds are<br />\nOehlkers<br />\nallocated,\"<br />\ncontinued.<br /><br />\nOehlkers also said that cable<br />\nTV will be installed in the<br />\nHomewood area by December<br />\nand that the local cable company may allow the student-run<br />\nWJHU to use one of the publicaccess channels. \"The channel<br />\nlacks audio and is normally used<br />\nto scroll information, but the<br />\ncompany said that if we could<br />\npipe in the audio, they would<br />\nlet us use it,\" explained<br />\nOehlkers.<br />\n\"Although this wouldn't affect students very much since I<br />\ndon't how many will be able to<br />\nafford cable TV, the move<br />\nwould greatly increase our<br />\npotential audience,\" he<br />\ncontinued.<br />\n\"One of Welch's ideas was<br />\nto go with the cable hook up<br />\nand eliminate the AM carrier,\"<br />\nsaid Oehlkers. \"But the bulk of<br />\nthe money will go into running<br />\nthe station, not the initial start<br />\nup costs.\"<br />\nOehlkers also reported that<br />\nthe current WJHU is scheduled to go off the air as of midnight May 31. However WJHU<br />\ngeneral manager David Creagh<br />\ntold him the FCC has been<br />\n\"dragging their feet\" in processing the station's reapplication and the 25,000 watt station<br />\nmay not be operating until this<br />\nfall.<br />\n\"He pleaded with us to continue broadcasting over the<br />\nsummer,\" added Oehlkers. \"It<br />\nseems at this point that once we<br />\ngo down, we'll come back<br />\nsometime this summer as a contingency until fall when we can<br />\nwork out this AM plan.

At the risk<br />\nof sounding childish: We told you so.<br />\nFor a brief time, of course, the fair<br />\ndate was in fact switched to May 2-4. A<br />\nhome lacrosse game was scheduled for<br />\nthat weekend, but the powers that be<br />\ndecided they could work around that,<br />\nparticularly if it was the only way to save<br />\nthe fair. When that change was announced, however, the Math Department raised a hue and cry, pointing out that it had<br />\nalready rescheduled a conference<br />\noriginally slated for April 11-13. The<br />\nirony of the whole thing is that the math<br />\nconference was rescheduled for May 2-4,<br />\nso the fair ended up with the weekend<br />\nthe math department really wanted, and<br />\nvice versa.<br />\nAt the time, we didn't have much to<br />\nsay about the switch. For one thing, it<br />\noccured during the Christmas vacation,<br />\nand so was a fait accompli by the time<br />\nstudents returned.(No doubt that was a<br />\nhappy coincidence for the administration.) Still, we're not positive (read<br />\ncarefully\u2014positive) that the math con-<br /><br />\nference and the fair couldn't peacefully<br />\ncoexist. We didn't dig into the matter<br />\ndeeply at the time since it seemed to do<br />\nso would have been futile; now we wish<br />\nwe had.<br />\nAs everyone knows, the fair was essentially rained out. Friday (always a slow<br />\nday anyway) was miserable, Saturday<br />\nwas reasonalbe (not great) and Sunday<br />\nwas somewhere in between. The net effect was a dramatic drop in attendance.<br />\nThe key thing now, though, is not to<br />\nbemoan the weather (which, after all, is<br />\nhardly anyone's fault), but to insure that<br />\nthere are no more scheduling screw-ups<br />\nin the future. When all the fuss over this<br />\nyear's date was going on in January,<br />\nAssociate Dean of Students Chris Colombo said a University calendar was being established which would eliminate<br />\nsuch conflicts in the future. We hope so,<br />\nbut considering that we can't remember<br />\na year when scheduling the fair wasn't<br />\na problem, we're not optimistic. Promises that setting a fair date will soon be<br />\neasy strike us about like promises that<br />\nWJHU will get its power increase soon,<br />\nthat teaching will matter in tenure decisions and that hell will freeze over.<br />\nPerhaps this fair's problems were in<br />\nfact unavoidable. They were certainly a<br />\npity. The test now is to see that next year<br />\na more reasonable date can be found.<br /><br />\nA Quality Debate<br />\nThe Coalition for a Free South Africa<br />\nsaid recently it hopes the quality of antidivestment rhetoric will rise. We agree.<br />\nBut we'd also like to see the .Coalition<br />\ntake a little of its own medicine.<br />\nQuite simply, the quality of the debate<br />\nsurrounding the South African investment issue has declined sharply. Both<br />\nsides now seem to imply\u2014if not say<br />\nexplicitly\u2014that anyone who disagrees<br />\nwith them is automatically unreasonable,<br />\nsilly and motivated by ignoble concerns.<br />\nAnd it's clear that both groups have used, to say the least, deceptive arguments.<br />\nFirst, a few examples of the latter:<br />\nJeff Lurie, then the president of the<br />\nCollege Republicans, said recently in a<br />\nletter to the editor of this newspaper that<br />\nAngola was guilty of human rights violations worse than those caused by apartheid, \"as documented by Amnesty International.\" Not quite. The fact is<br />\nAmnesty International, as one of its local<br />\nleaders points out in a letter this week,<br />\ndoes not compare countries.<br />\nPatrick Bond and Theo Nkone, to<br />\nleading members of the pro-divestment<br />\ncamp, recently backed up their criticisms<br />\nof Inkatha (a South African antidivestment organization) by writing,<br />\n\"See the New York Times front page article of March 31 where Inkatha is<br />\ndescribed as a `facist organization.' and<br />\n'wholly in league' with the white<br />\nauthorities.\" Well, sort of. The Times<br />\nwas actually quoting a committee of Inkatha opponents. To omit that fact<br /><br />\nmakes it sound as if it was the impartial<br />\njudgment of the newspaper that Inkatha<br />\nis \"facist.\" (The truth is that the Times<br />\nalso said Buthelezi is \"opposed to apartheid.\") Why didn't Bond and Nkone<br />\nproperly attribute the quote?<br />\nBut at least as worrisome as the deceptions and half-truths is the tenor of the<br />\ndebate in the last few weeks. The Coalition said recently, for example, that \"any<br />\nobjective observer\" (emphasis added)<br />\nwill conclude that Gatsha Buthelezi, the<br />\nleader of Inkatha, is a \"stooge\" of the<br />\nSouth African government. The Students<br />\nfor Inkatha, on the other hand, have said<br />\nthat to suggest such a thing is an \"utter<br />\nabsurdity\" that can be seen by \"anyone<br />\nwho has even a cursory knowledge of<br />\nButhelezi's political background.\" Well,<br />\nit can't be seen (as pointed out above)<br />\nby a committee of politically active South<br />\nAfricans. As for the Coalition's argument, nothing can be seen by any objecIke observer.<br />\nWe understand that all of these<br />\norganizations are arguing for things in<br />\nwhich they sincerely believe. We aren't<br />\nso naive as to expect either side to use<br />\nkid gloves.<br />\nBut we do expect them to respect each<br />\nother. They can at least admit the other<br />\nguys are knowledgeable (both groups<br />\nclearly are), thoughtful and sincere\u2014but<br />\nstill claim they're just dead wrong. If that<br />\nhappens, the Coalition will get its<br />\nwish\u2014the quality of the debate will rise.<br />\nOn both sides, let's hope.<br /><br />\nOver the past several weeks,<br />\nthe Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica has attempted to coerce<br />\nthe University's divestment<br />\nfrom companies_ that do<br />\nbusiness in South Africa. In<br />\ntheir zealous pursuit of their<br />\ngoal, coalition members<br />\nadopted a double standard:<br />\nwhile they avidly condemn<br />\napartheid (as we all do), they ignore equal, if not greater,<br />\ncrimes and atrocities committed<br />\nby the Soviet Union and its<br />\nclient regimes.

On the<br />\ncontrary, it is a quite useful way<br />\nof summarizing, in a nutshell,<br />\nthe general tone of the Office of<br />\nthe Chaplain (indeed, Ginsborg<br />\ndoes not try to refute this<br />\ncharge\u2014he simply calls it<br />\n\"frivolous\"). \"Left of the leftof-center\" is also a good way to<br />\ndistinguish, for example, European Socialist Parties from the<br />\nU.S. Democratic Party (which<br />\nis left-of-center).<br />\nMost of the activities of the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain do not<br />\ngreatly \"distress\" me. What<br />\nprovoked me to write my letter<br />\nwas its providing busing for the<br />\nNational March for Women's<br />\nLives. The idea of a march supporting the continued legalization of the murder of the unborn is sick.

As a matter of<br />\nprinciple, Amnesty International never engages in comparisons between countries or<br />\nbetween successive governments as to which has a<br />\n\"worse\" record of human<br />\nrights violations. The organization investigates human rights<br />\nabuses in a strictly impartial<br />\nfashion, and it does not work<br />\nfor or against governments, but<br />\napplies a single universal standard to all countries regardless<br />\nof the ideology of the government or the views of its victims.<br />\nTo suggest, as Lurie does, that<br />\nAmnesty International has<br />\nclaimed that Angola has a<br />\nworse human rights record than<br />\nSouth Africa, is an attempt to<br />\nuse th prestige of Amnesty International to further partisan<br />\npolitical views in a way that<br />\nsubverts its authority and<br />\nmisleads readers who may not<br />\nbe familiar with Amnesty's<br />\nposition.<br />\nIn fact, Amnesty International has documented human<br />\nrights problems in both Angola<br />\nand South Africa. The main<br />\nconcern in Angola is prolonged detention without trial of<br />\nabout 1,000 persons suspected<br />\nof supporting armed opposition<br />\ngroups, such as UNITA, and<br />\nthe use of the death penalty to<br />\npunish about 30 individuals<br />\nconvicted by military tribunals<br />\nof being members of supporters<br />\nof opposition groups.

Unfortunately, the international dinner planned for<br />\nApril 19th has been cancelled.<br />\nA questionnaire went out in<br />\nlate February to allow students<br />\nto sign up for these events. As<br />\nmost of them are limited to<br />\nsmall groups, places were<br />\nassigned on a first-come, first-<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nserved basis. Several events<br />\nhave been held already, and<br />\nseem to have gone well, judging from the reactions of faculty hosts and students alike.<br />\nGunther Anderson and Patty Kwon spent Saturday, April<br />\n5th at the Impressionist exhibit<br />\nat the National Gallery of Art<br />\nin Washington. The line for<br />\ntickets stretched around the<br />\nbuilding and down the street,<br />\nbut the Hopkins students had<br />\nreceived their tickets in advance. Finding that they had<br />\ntwo extra, Anderson said,\"We<br />\ngave them to an old couple at<br />\nthe end of the ticket line. The<br />\npeople in front of them got<br />\npretty miffed.\" They enjoyed<br />\nthe exhibit very much. Their<br />\nhost was Dr. David Hult,<br />\nDepartment of French, who<br />\ncame for the same thing we<br />\ndid,\u2014 said Anderson, \"he<br />\nwanted to see the paintings.<br />\nHe's a professor of French<br />\nliterature, not of French art.<br />\nWe didn't learn a lot about<br />\nFrench Impressionism, but we<br />\nlearned plenty about how to<br />\nfind a place to live in Charles<br />\nVillage, and we learned he's a<br />\nnice guy.\" That, after all, was<br />\nthe point of the trip.<br />\nDr. Y. C. Lee of the Department of Biology was not quite<br />\nso pleased with the chamber<br /><br />\nmusic group he and his wife<br />\nsponsored at their house. Apparently only two of the<br />\nstudents on the list for that<br />\nevent showed up, but \"there<br />\nhad been some informal interactions in the meantime, and<br />\nother students came, so it ended well,\" said Lee.<br />\nOn Friday, April 11, six<br />\nstudents got a long-awaited<br />\nbreak from ARA food when<br />\nthey went to Louie's Bookstore<br />\nand Cafe, followed by an evening at the Baltimore Symphony<br />\nOrchestra. Sonia Marx was enthusiastic about the event. The<br />\nfood was good. The music was<br />\nan unusual mixture of styles,<br />\nfeaturing classical composers<br />\nlike Bizet and Sibelius in the<br />\nfirst half and show music, from<br />\nGershwin's Porgy and Bess, to<br />\nE.T., after intermission. Dr.<br />\nSidney Mintz, of the Anthropology Department and his<br />\nwife received rave reviews.<br />\n\"They were neat,\" said Marx;<br />\n\"Dr. Mintz and his wife said<br />\nthey come to the symphony<br />\nalmost every Friday night to<br />\ncelebrate the fact that he<br />\ndoesn't have to teach the next<br />\nday.\"<br />\nDr. Mintz enjoyed the evening as well. \"The students were<br />\ngreat. We had fun, and I would<br />\ngladly do it again,\" he said. He<br /><br />\nhad some suggestions for improving the program such as arranging a system in which the<br />\ngroups could meet more than<br />\nonce. \"It's fun,\" he said, \"but<br />\nit's almost like a first date, with<br />\neverybody on their very best<br />\nbehavior and not much time to<br />\nget to know each other. If the<br />\nschool really wants to foster<br />\nstudent-faculty interaction, the<br />\nbest and least expensive way to<br />\ndo it is over lunch.\" Citing his<br />\nexperience at Yale, where faculty<br />\nand<br />\nundergraduates<br />\nhabitually eat together under<br />\nthe college system, Dr. Mintz<br />\nencouraged faculty-student<br />\nmeals as the ideal way to promote interaction on a regular<br />\nbasis. Hmm, if the professors<br />\nstarted eating at ARA, would<br />\nthe quality go up?<br />\nAt any rate, the present program seems to be well-liked.<br />\nBoth students and professors<br />\nsaid they would probably say<br />\nhello if they ran into each other<br />\nin the hall, and everyone<br />\nrecommended the program to<br />\ninterested students next year. If<br />\nthe remaining four events go as<br />\nwell as the preceeding ones, the<br />\n1986 Student-Faculty Interaction Program will have been a<br />\nbig success.<br /><br />\nGood Impressions of a Museum Trip<br />\nby Elissa Mittman<br />\nEspecially since I don't have<br />\na car at Hopkins, I jumped at<br />\na chance to get away from campus. The student-faculty trip to<br />\nthe Impressionism exhibit at the<br />\nNational Art Gallery in<br />\nWashington, DC, with David<br />\nHuh of the French Department<br />\nprovided just the escape and a<br />\ngreat break from studying.<br />\nHow often does one get the opportunity to spend a day in DC<br />\n(without paying a cent) and to<br />\nparticipate in something<br />\nculturally-oriented? Transportation, a box lunch (which was<br />\nsurprisingly good), and admission tickets and an accompanying headset to the exhibit were<br />\nall included in the day's outing.<br />\nThe mixture of people in our<br />\ngroup amazed me the most.<br />\nFirst of all, I expected plenty of<br />\nArt History and Humanities<br />\nmajors. Secondly, I figured an<br />\nart exhibition trip would probably attract mostly females.<br />\nWell, to say the let, I was proven wrong on both accounts.<br />\nThe majority of people were<br />\nBMEs, Electrical Engineers,<br />\nand Pre-meds. There was only<br />\none IR major and me, a<br />\nHumanities Area major. Out of<br />\nour group of eleven people, only three were females. Once<br />\nagain; the Hopkins ratio<br />\nstrikes! The group spanned all<br />\nclasses and few people knew<br />\neach other ahead of time. We<br />\nall got acquainted with each<br />\nother and our supervisor, Hult,<br />\non the bus ride down and over<br />\nlunch. By the end of the day,<br /><br />\nwe were all comparing our impressions ot the exninit anu oui<br />\nmuseum shop purchases.<br />\nAlthough most of us wandered alone through the exhibit,<br />\nwe would frequently stop and<br />\nchat with another member of<br />\nour party. \"The New PaintingImpressionism\" exhibition produced a wide display of canvases that were thoroughly appealing. The exhibit centered on<br />\nthe the eight pioneering independent exhibitions of Impressionist artists from<br />\n1874-1886. Paintings, drawings, and sculptures from such<br />\ndiverse artists as Cezanne,<br />\nDegas, Monet, Gaugin, and<br />\nSerrat were displayed. The exhibition's systematic format,<br />\nbeginning in 1874 and ending in<br />\n1886, showed how concepts of<br />\nlight and color progressed and<br />\ndeveloped over the years. The<br />\naccompanying taped explanation provided informative<br />\nbackground material for us artistic novices.<br />\nAfter a quick walk through<br />\nthe museum shop, it was time<br />\nto leave. My one complaint was<br />\nthat I would've liked to stay<br />\nlonger at the museum to see<br />\nother exhibits.<br />\nStudents should definitely<br />\nmake the time and effort to be<br />\ninvolved in the Student-Faculty<br />\nInteraction Program. Don't be<br />\ndiscouraged if you're on the<br />\nwaiting list for a trip. I was the<br />\ntenth alternate and got the opportunity to go. The program<br />\nenables students and faculty<br />\nmembers to relate to each other<br />\non a non-academic level as well<br /><br />\nas offering a break from campus surroundings.

Watching chess<br />\nwas never what I would consider an exciting way to spend<br />\nan evening. I am pleased to say<br />\nthat I was wrong.<br />\nThe Chess Club, and many<br />\nchessophiles from around the<br />\nstate were fortunate enough to<br />\nwitness an exhibition of<br />\nsimultaneous chess, as played<br />\nby Danish Grandmaster Bent<br />\nLarsen, last Friday in the Glass<br />\nPavilion.<br />\nLarsen's credentials are certainly impressive. From<br />\n1967-1968, he set a record for<br />\nconsecutive victories, winning<br />\neleven major tournaments in<br /><br />\nBobby Fisher.<br />\nAs a man, Bent Larsen is<br />\nquite articulate, personable,<br />\nand witty. Reports had been<br />\nthat Larsen was an egotist, but<br />\nI found nothing to evidence this<br />\nclaim. He was more than happy to field questions, autograph<br />\nchess boards, and talk to<br />\nanyone individually before and<br />\nafter the exhibition. In fact, the<br />\nquestion and answer period had<br />\nto be cut short by Hopkins<br />\nChess Club president Joel<br />\nSalman, as it had already run<br />\nmore than an hour.<br />\nFor those of you unfamiliar<br />\nwith simultaneous chess, one<br />\nplayer (in this case Mr. Larsen)<br />\nwalks from one board to the<br />\nnext as each player makes his<br />\nmove or countermove (depending on who's playing white).<br /><br />\nsuccession. He was called the<br />\nstrongest non-Russian in chess.<br />\nIn 1970, Larsen played board<br />\none in a U.S.S.R. versus the<br />\nrest-of-the-world match. Three<br />\ntimes he was a contender for<br />\nthe world championship, but<br />\nperhaps he is best known for his<br />\n1971 victory over chess legend<br /><br />\nIn this exhibition, Mr. Larsen<br />\nfaced twenty-four players,<br />\nfourteen of them being<br />\nHopkins students. The Danish<br />\nGrandmaster ended up winning<br />\ntwenty-one, losing two, and<br />\ndrawing one: The only two to<br />\ndefeat him Were Robert Smith,<br />\nwho is affiliated with the Space<br /><br />\nby Jeffrey S. Yager<br /><br />\nTelescope Institute, and Troy<br />\nRoberts.<br />\nThe draw went to Hopkins<br />\nsophmore Prabhu Raju.<br />\nMr. Larsen's style was quite<br />\ndynamic. He is unpredictable,<br />\nyet at the same time<br />\nmethodical. He is,. very<br />\naggressive, and is not afraid to<br />\ntake a risk or two. All in all, ne<br />\nis exciting, yes I said, exciting<br />\nto watch.<br />\nBent Larsen comes to<br />\nHopkins after an appearance in<br />\nthe New York Open, where he<br />\ndid not fare particularly well.<br />\nHe was the highest ranked<br />\nplayer in the international class,<br />\nand attributed his disappointing<br />\nperformance to flying directly<br />\nover from the London Open.<br />\nStill, his mood was good.<br />\nMr. Larsen's fee was twentyfive dollars a board, though<br />\nHopkins students payed only<br />\nseven.

If<br />\nstudents voted, the result<br />\nwouldn't be right,because comparing different styles of art is<br />\nlike comparing apples and<br />\noranges.

Up until the last,<br />\nfew years, it was the best that,<br />\ntechnology had to offer. Now<br />\nin vitro techniques and computer modeling are swiftly<br />\nsatisfying the \"three R's.\"<br />\nThese characteristics were<br />\nlisted in a recent CAAT'<br />\nnewsletter. New methods<br />\nmust replace an animal<br />\nmethod in use, reduce the<br />\nnumber of animals used in a<br />\ngiven test, and refine an existing procedure to alleviate<br />\nor lessen animal suffering.<br />\nIn vitro tests have yet to be<br />\nvalidated by the scientific<br />\ncommunity. Still, PETA feels<br />\nthat the in vitro methods,<br />\neven at this early stage, are as<br />\nvalid as the Draize test could<br />\never be. Many scientists, such<br />\nas Michael Balls of the In-<br /><br />\n\u2018terlab FRAME, stress that<br />\nvalidation is a necessary, important step, and not<br />\nsomething to \"just jump into.\" Moreover, industries are<br />\nloathe to accept something<br />\n,that has not been strenuously tested in their own labs. To<br />\ndo so would be an abrupt<br />\n,break<br />\nfrom<br />\nfirmly;entrenched tradition and<br />\n:would require the manufacturers to place warning labels<br />\non their products, a prospect<br />\nfor which they are not too<br />\neager. PETA and groups like<br />\nthe Coalition to Ban the<br />\nLD-50 and Draize Test see<br />\nthese as trivial concerns.<br />\nTo its credit, the industry<br />\nis providing a large amount<br />\nof research funds, mainly<br />\nthrough its trade group, the<br />\nCosmetic, Toiletry, and<br />\nFragrance Association. Still,\u2022<br />\nthe animal rights groups are<br />\nwaiting, and growing more<br />\nimpatient as time passes. As<br />\nSusan Rich, coordinator for<br />\nPETA concludes,\"One company will have to be first (to<br />\naccept in vitro).

The<br />\ncomplete validation process is<br />\nexpected to take four or five<br />\nyears. Still progress in in vitro<br />\ntechnology is being made every<br />\nday. It was recently announced<br />\nthat a group of Hopkins<br />\nWilmer Eye Institute researchers, led by Dr. Ruben Adler,<br />\nare the first to grow photoreceptors (rods and cones)from<br />\nthe retina. This development<br />\nwill have definite implications<br />\nin the future of in vitro testing.<br />\nAccording to Adler, \"Certain<br />\ntests can be performed this<br />\nway, including the response of<br />\nthese cells to toxic chemicals.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins symposium as<br />\na whole put strong emphasis on<br />\nthe fact that validation is itself<br />\na learning process, an integral<br />\npart of the in vitro evolution.<br />\nFrazier says, \"The Draize test<br />\noffered a certain spectrum of<br />\ninformation. What we are doing now is investigating the<br />\nmechanisms of another spectrum.\" The continuity of<br />\nresearch is always intact. W.<br />\nGary Flamm, director of toxicological sciences for the FDA<br />\nadds, \"the impetus for us to<br />\nlook at alternatives came from<br />\nthe animal welfare movement.<br />\nIt's pushing us in the right<br />\ndirection, towards something<br />\nthat is really an improvement in<br />\nthe science.\" Frazier concurs,<br />\n\"The end result will be better<br />\ntoxicology.\"<br /><br />\n4111111110.01011110.0411111.04111.0.4\u20221004111111000.\u202211111.04111.11.4)41111.o.mmoimwoill...<br /><br />\n0111111111P(<br /><br />\nThe Student Services Committee of<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\npresents<br /><br />\nTuesciay \" Wednesda7<br />\n2n4 23r4<br />\n\u00a7 Pipri i<br />\nt ' 9fini +0 3Prn<br />\na+ it( Glass FL<br />\nLB<br /><br />\nIL.<br />\ni0<br /><br />\nDRIVE<br /><br />\nA Year End Furniture<br />\nSale Service<br />\n1<br />\n1<br /><br />\nType up short classified-ad style descriptions<br /><br />\nof your merchandise and leave in the Student<br />\ni Services box in the Council Office (or slip<br />\n!under door).

To<br />\nput it simply, Goudy was just<br />\nplain outstanding at the plate,<br />\ngoing 5 for 5 on the day, scoring 2 runs while driving in 3.<br />\nIt's the manner in which Goudy<br />\nwent 5 for 5 that's the outstanding part, however. He hit the<br />\ncycle\u2014a single, a double, a triple, and a homerun, and he<br />\nadded another homer on top of<br />\nthat, a two-run blast in the first<br />\nhalf of the ninth that proved to<br />\nbe the game winner. If this were<br />\na fourth of July party, no one<br />\nwould be disappointed; Mike<br />\nKevin Thomas Tully<br />\nGoudy supplied all the<br />\nwho have losi bin<br />\nfireworks.<br />\nThe game began rather quiet-<br /><br />\n' ly for the visiting Blue Jays,<br />\n(who made the long three hour<br />\ntrek to the Eastern Shore the<br />\nday after completing a<br />\ndoubleheader at home versus<br />\nWashington College). They<br />\nwere tired, and it showed.<br />\nHopkins went down pretty<br />\nmuch in the first two innings,<br />\nwith Goudy (who else) managing the only hit, a single to left<br />\nfield. Sophomore right-hander<br />\nDave Psenicska surrendered a<br />\nrun on three successive singles<br />\nin the bottom of the 2nd to put<br />\nHopkins down I-0. In the 3rd,<br />\nHopkins tied the score on<br />\nGoudy's solo homer over the<br />\nleft center-field fence, his second of the season. After a<br />\nscoreless 4th inning by both<br />\nclubs, the Jays put two more on<br />\nthe board in the top of the 5th<br />\nby way of Senior tri-captain<br />\nScotty Burns' mammoth 425<br />\nfeet, two-run shot over the left<br />\nfield wall. Burns hit the ball so<br />\nlong and so hard that he stood<br /><br />\nat home plate a la Reggie<br />\nJackson to watch it sail out of<br />\nthe ballpark, before beginning<br />\nhis homerun trot. Said Burns,<br />\n\"I always wanted to do that,<br />\n[stand and watch a ball go over<br />\nthe fence after I hit it] so I did.\"<br />\nWell put, Reggie.<br />\nSalisbury refused to die,<br />\nhowever and added three in the<br />\nbottom of the eighth to tie the<br />\ngame at 4 runs apiece. In the<br />\n9th, shortstop Ned Offit led off<br />\nwith a single and Mike Goudy<br />\nbrought home the winning runs<br />\nwith his second round-tripper<br />\nof the game to give Hopkins a<br />\nlead they wouldn't relinquish,<br />\n6-4. Burns later scored on a<br />\nwild pitch after reaching base<br />\nand a'double to extend the Blue<br />\nJay lead to 7-4, and Salisbury<br />\nadded another run in their last<br />\nat bats to make the final 7-5.<br />\nOne day earlier, Hopkins<br />\ntook two games from<br />\nContinued on Page 27<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nBUY TWO CASES OF MILLER HIGH LIFE<br />\nAND GET ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE<br />\nCBS RECORDS OR TAPES FREE.<br />\nBuy Miller High Life and you can get the hottest<br />\nalbum or tape by one of your favorite CBS artists.<br />\nStars like Kenny Loggins.

Washington<br />\nbattled back to within two runs<br />\nafter touching winning pitcher<br />\nPeter Blohm (6-0) for a couple<br />\nin the 6th inning. But Hopkins<br />\nproved to be much too strong<br />\nand outlasted the Shoremen<br />\n5-4. Blohm pitched seven innings and recorded 10 strikeouts<br />\nto increase his team lead to an<br />\nincredible 47 K's in 472/3<br />\ninnings.<br />\nIn the Game 2 laugher,<br />\nHopkins seemed to do no<br />\nwrong, apparently wanting and<br />\nultimately receiving revenge<br />\nagainst Washington for making<br />\nthe first contest so close. The<br />\nJays batted around twice in the<br />\nfirst inning alone, and thus the<br /><br />\nstarters were given time off in<br />\nthe 2nd inning to go and enjoy<br />\nthe sights of Spring Fair, while<br />\ntheir subs finished the game.<br />\nFifteen runs were scored in the<br />\nmarathon 1st inning; everyone<br />\nscored at least one, and Burns<br />\nand Raedle each were 2 for 2<br />\nwith \"The Rock\" collecting 4<br />\nRBI's in the inning alone. Some<br />\nfine individual performances<br />\nwere put on by the Blue Jay<br />\nbench, including Freshman<br />\nDan Durocher who went 2 for<br />\n2 and Junior Joe DeRosa, who<br />\nin a rare game appearance, just<br />\nmissed a diving circus catch in<br />\nleft field during the 6th inning.<br />\nin an attempt to save a shut out<br />\nfor winning pitcher Mark<br />\nCampbell (8-1). Campbell pitched seven innings and struck 1<br />\nout eight, lowering his team<br />\nand nationally ranked ERA to<br />\n1.24.<br />\nDiamond Dust: Hopkins'<br />\nrecord now stands at 22 and 1<br />\nwith no apparent end in sight.<br />\nThe Blue Jays just kecp on winning and they're winning big<br /><br />\nthese days. Leading the Black<br />\nand Blue Bat',are Jim Hobensack (.483) and Scotty Burns<br />\n(.465). Burns, who recently<br />\nreturned to the lineup after a<br />\nknee injury, is 5 for 5 in his 5<br />\nat bats and has reached base 7<br />\nout of his last 7 plate appearances. Burns also is tied<br />\nwith Goudy for the home run<br />\nlead with 3.

Wednesda,r's game versus UMBC was<br />\nrained out and will be played at<br />\na later date. Next home action<br />\nfor Hopkins is today at 3 p.m.<br />\nversus Franklin and Marshall<br />\nand a doubleheader Sunday,<br />\nbeginning at 1 p.m. against<br />\nYork College.'<br /><br />\nGolfers Get Whacked<br />\nby Steven Schiller<br />\nThe golf team lost three matches in the past week to Gettysburg, the University of<br />\nDelaware, and York College.<br />\nThe team record has dropped to<br />\n0 and 6 but the team is playing<br />\nmuch better.<br />\nThe contest against Gettysburg was extremely close in<br />\nevery match. The final result,<br />\nthough, was a disappointing<br />\nloss by only one stroke. Jon<br />\nAbrahams led the team in the<br />\nnumber one spot and tied his<br />\nopponent with a score of 85.<br />\nMarc Koren shot a helpful 90.<br />\nSteven Schiller played number<br />\nthree and shot a 92 to his opponents 97. John Savitz had a<br />\ngreat round for the Whackers<br />\nwith a 94 and John Thompson<br />\nrounded out the Jays effort<br />\nwith a 97. But when all the<br />\nscores were tallied, the Hopkins<br />\ntotal fell one stroke short.<br />\nAgainst Delaware, the team<br />\nwas fighting a losing battle even<br />\nbefore the first hole because<br />\ntheir opponents are tops in division 1 golf. The Jays lost by<br />\nover 40 strokes but they still<br />\nplayed extremely well. Charlie<br />\nDigby played a great match,<br />\nshooting a personal season low<br />\nand tieing his opponent, with<br />\nan 84. Other scores from the<br />\nmatch included an 85 by John<br />\nAbrahams, a 95 by Todd<br />\nStefan and a 92 by Marc Koren.<br />\nJohn Savitz was asked to comment on the team's play, and<br /><br />\nevin<br /><br />\nDan Landolphi settles under a lb hall in deep right.<br /><br />\nFINDING AN APARTMENT<br />\nIN MANHATTAN TAKES<br />\nTHE RIGHT EDUCATION<br /><br />\nsaid,\"We played a great defensive match which can be seen in<br />\nDelaware's shot total [their five<br />\nman total was over 400 for the<br />\nfirst time this season].\"<br />\nIn the match against York,<br />\nHopkins played well again but<br />\nsome clutch scores by the<br />\nnumber 6 and 7 men for York<br />\nled to another defeat. Jon<br />\nAbrahams played well as usual,<br />\nshooting a 78. Bill Marquardt<br />\nwas back in the lineup after suffering a Spring Fair injury. He<br />\nshot an impressive 82. Todd<br />\nStefan was back in form with<br />\nan 84 and Charlie Digby held<br />\nup his end with an 86. The final<br />\nqualifying score for the<br />\nWhackers came from Marc<br />\nKoren with a 92. This stroke<br />\ntotal of 422 was clearly a season<br />\nbest and has psyched the team<br />\nup for the MAC's.<br />\nCoach O'Donnell was asked<br />\nto explain the team losses<br />\ndespite their improving scores.<br />\nHe said, \"Last season's captain, Ashu Handa, had promised to fly in from Bologna to try<br />\nand help the team effort, but he<br />\napparently missed the plane<br />\nand disappointed his teammates. This disappointment has<br />\ndepressed the team and has effected their performance, but<br />\nthe team is slowly getting over<br />\nthis heartbreak and is expected<br />\nto do extremely well at the<br />\nMAC's.\" Clearly, the golfers<br />\nare an emotional team so if they<br />\npull themselves together, there<br />\nwill be no stopping them.<br /><br />\nGet a free copy of \"Manhattan Moves\"\u2014<br />\nthe insider's guide to finding an affordable<br />\napartment in Manhattan.<br />\nTo welcome potential new<br />\nresidents to the city, and dispel<br />\nsome myths about housing in<br />\nNew York, we have published a<br />\nbook called \"Manhattan Moves\".<br />\nIt's the ultimate insider's guide<br />\nto apartment hunting in the<br />\nBig Apple.<br />\n\"Manhattan Moves\" helps<br />\nyou set your sights on the right<br />\ntype of apartment and location.
