Eisenhower<br />\nwho died in May. The lecture<br />\nseries is the only \"living<br />\nmemorial\" to Eisenhower said<br />\n<br />\nBrad Marks, co-chairman of<br />\nthe Symposium along with<br />\nMike DeRosa.<br />\nDuring the course of this session called,\"Arms Control, the<br />\nAnswer,\" both men discussed<br />\nthe current problems in arms<br />\ncontrol such as the need for<br />\nStar Wars, President Reagan's<br />\nStrategic Defense Initiative<br />\n(SDI) to develop a defense<br />\nagainst nuclear missiles through<br />\nhigh technology. Another problem that drew comments from<br />\nboth speakers was Soviet<br />\nPremier Mikhail S. Gorbachev's<br />\noffer to reduce their existing<br />\nnuclear weaponry by 50 percent<br />\nin exchange for a commitment<br />\nfrom the U.S. to stop the SDI<br />\n<br />\nand reduce their weapons to the<br />\nsame level.<br />\nMcGovern and Warnke each<br />\ntalked about the subjects that<br />\nconcerned them the most.<br />\nMcGovern restated his campaign themes of the nuclear<br />\nfreeze and the cancellation of<br />\nthe MX missile program. Warnke spoke of the stupidity of<br />\nthe failure of the U.S. to ratify<br />\nthe SALT II treaty, plus the<br />\nneed for further arms control<br />\nagreements.<br />\nIn honor of Milton<br />\nEisenhower and his brother,<br />\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower,<br />\nMcGovern said, \"They are the<br />\nkind of men I admired.\"<br />\nDwight Eisenhower and his<br />\n<br />\nVP Post Subject of Debate<br />\nAfter Frosh Primary Election<br />\nby Jon Stempel<br />\nA victory for Grace Kung in<br />\nthe race for freshmen class<br />\nsecretary and a controversy in<br />\nthe race for the class's vicepresident marked Tuesday's<br />\nfreshman elections.<br />\nKung easily defeated her two<br />\nrivals for secretary, Marty<br />\nOberle and Robert Schuster, by<br />\ncapturing 257 votes, nearly<br />\nfifty-seven percent of the 454<br />\nballots that freshmen cast.<br />\nIn the race for vice-president,<br />\naccording to Elections Committee Chairman Scott Turner,<br />\ncandidate Cary Gross was<br />\ndissatisfied with the EC's<br />\ndeclaration of a run-off<br />\nbecause, while he did not<br />\nreceive a majority of the votes<br />\ncast, he outpolled the other<br />\ncandidate, Wayne Myslik,<br />\n204-120, and believes he deserves<br />\n.ed to win. Turner said that<br />\n<br />\nGross was planning to file a<br />\nprotest to the EC.<br />\nTurner said that a candidate<br />\nmust have received \"a clear fifty percent plus one majority\"<br />\nof the total number of votes<br />\ncast in order to win his race.<br />\nBecause 454 votes were cast<br />\nfor all offices except representative and 1,005 votes were cast<br />\nfor representative, a candidate<br />\nfor all offices except representative had to receive 228 votes<br />\nto win, while a representative<br />\ncandidate had to receive 503<br />\nvotes to win. An abstention, according to Turner, counted in<br />\nall races except the race for<br />\nrepresentative as a vote cast.<br />\nGross argued, \"My immediate reaction was disbelief<br />\nbecause I was told by a member<br />\nof the Election Committee that<br />\nthis would be the final election<br />\nfor the vice-presidency. The<br />\npurpose for a primary in any<br />\n<br />\nelection for office is to narrow<br />\nthe field of candidates to two.<br />\n\"Although the rules say that<br />\nsomeone needs a fifty percent<br />\nplus one majority for him to<br />\nwin in the primaries,\" continued Gross, \"that rule was<br />\nobviously mandated for situations in which there are more<br />\nthan two candidates. Common<br />\nsense would dictate that when<br />\nyou have only two candidates<br />\nto begin with, only one election<br />\nis necessary.\"<br />\nMyslik contended, \"Considering the validity of the rules<br />\nof the Elections Committee, I<br />\nfeel it would be at this time<br />\npointless to argue because-any<br />\nchanges that would be made<br />\ncould not affect an election that<br />\nhas already taken place.\"<br />\n\"As for Cary's protest,\"<br />\ncontinued Myslik, \"both Cary<br />\nContinued on Page 5<br />\n<br />\nbrother understood the dangers<br />\nof the arms race and if<br />\nEisenhower were still President<br />\nand his brother still advising<br />\nhim, there \"would not be a<br />\ntwo-hundred billion dollar annual deficit and a two trillion<br />\ndollar national debt stemming<br />\nin large part from military programs like Star Wars and the<br />\nMX missile.\"<br />\nMcGovern stated,\"This<br />\nSymposium addresses the<br />\ntranscendent issue of our age:<br />\nsaving our civilization from<br />\nnuclear annihilation.\"<br />\nMcGovern then proceeded to<br />\ngive the history of what he<br />\ntermed, \"Reagan's perceived<br />\n'window of vulnerability' for<br />\n<br />\nAmerica concerning Soviet<br />\nnuclear strength.\" He concluded that Star Wars, if it is being<br />\nused as a bargaining chip for<br />\nnegotiation with the U.S.S.R.,<br />\nit is a \"bad bargain\" especially since \"most respected scientists in the U.S. have no faith<br />\nin Star Wars.\"<br />\nGorbachev's offer to cut existing nuclear weapons in exchange for Star Wars is \"too<br />\ngood to be true,\" said<br />\nMcGovern.<br />\n\"The United States should<br />\nfollow up Gorbachev's offer<br />\nwith a four-point comprehensive plan for arms control,\"<br />\nContinued on Page 9<br />\n<br />\nWhat's Inside<br />\nWho says Hopkins students<br />\ndon't do interesting things?<br />\nAs part of a program for<br />\nEagle Scouts, Douglas<br />\nBarnhart spent two-and-ahalf months in Antarctica last<br />\nyear.

Included among<br />\nthese are Spring Fair, Orientation, and athletic events supported by the classes. According to Rich Pan, a member of<br />\nthe SAC committee, \"There is<br />\na need to investigate these other<br />\n<br />\nexpenses.\"<br />\nFormer HOP chairman Mike<br />\nDeRosa also voiced concern<br />\nthat the cost of providing entertainment is increasing faster<br />\nthan the class budgets. \"Going<br />\naway from beer programming,<br />\nyou need good entertainment to<br />\ndraw people to events,\" he<br />\nclaimed. Sophomore Class<br />\nRepresentative Jenny Stahl<br />\nonly<br />\nthe<br />\nthat<br />\nadded<br />\neconomically feasible way to<br />\norganize social events is \"cosponsorship or to have the<br />\nHOP take over everything.\"<br />\nThe funding problem also extends to lecture series and the<br />\nMSE Symposium. \"The community and university divisions<br />\nlook to us for entertainment.\"<br />\nDeRosa said, \"and it is a reflection of the university when people say the students can't bring<br />\nbig names [to lecture] on<br />\ncampus.\"<br />\nThe council also named Little as chairperson of the ad-hoc<br />\ncommittee by a vote of 8-4-1. A<br />\nreport is to be made to the<br />\ncouncil on the results by the end<br />\nof the semester.<br />\nAlso at the council meeting:<br />\n\u2022Members of the JHU<br />\nHouse of Commons submitted<br />\na letter to the council expressing their dissatisfaction with the<br />\nresolution that was recently<br />\npassed supporting the boycott<br />\nof classes today as a symbol of<br />\nprotest against apartheid. The<br />\nletter stated that the council<br />\n\"acted inappropriately...and<br />\nshould not take positions on<br />\n<br />\nnon-campus, political issues.\"<br />\nAlso in the letter, the House<br />\nof Commons said that it<br />\nbelieves that council should<br />\nfunction only in regards to<br />\n\"campus issues such as<br />\nacademics and student life. If<br />\nmembers of student council feel<br />\nstrongly about a non-campus<br />\nissue, they should put forward<br />\na referendum for approval by<br />\nthe student body.<br />\nThe council defended its action by declaring that nothing<br />\nin the constitution prevents the<br />\nbody from acting on noncampus or \"political\" issues.<br />\nAfter the letter presented,<br />\nSenior Class President Paul<br />\nDonio replied, \"Your point is<br />\nwell-taken; we'd like to see<br />\nmore input from students.

The<br />\norganization began as a<br />\ncooperative buying group<br />\nwhich could save money for<br />\nmember schools by coordinating local programming<br />\nevents.

According to<br />\nMcGovern, this plan should include the following:<br />\n\u2022The U.S. should forego all<br />\ntesting and development of Star<br />\nWars in return for a mutual 50<br />\npercent reduction in existing<br />\nnuclear weapons while continuing laboratory research.<br />\n\u2022 The U.S. should also accept<br />\nGorbachev's offer of a<br />\nmoratorium on all nuclear<br />\ntesting and then negotiate a<br />\ncomprehensive test ban treaty.<br />\n\u2022 The MX missile should be<br />\ncancelled as \"a contribution to<br />\nbalancing the budget and as a<br />\ntribute to common sense.\"<br />\n\u2022Europe should be designated<br />\na nuclear-free zone which<br />\nmeans that the Western powers<br />\nwould withdraw all their<br />\nmissiles and the Soviets would<br />\nshift their missiles from European targets.<br />\nMcGovern ended his speech<br />\nwith the idea that people<br />\nwould, in the long run, do more<br />\nto produce peace than governments, and that someday<br />\ngovernments had better let the<br />\npeople do just that.<br />\nWarnke began with the statement that this is a \"crucial<br />\npoint in the history of strategic<br />\nnuclear thinking\" and that<br />\nsome people are \"tragically<br />\nmistaken to think that negotiation with the Soviets can't<br />\nwork.\"<br />\n<br />\nWarnke discussed the different schools of strategic<br />\nnuclear thought. One theory is<br />\nthat Mutually Assured Destruction(MAD)would take place in<br />\na nuclear exchange. Others<br />\nhold a Nuclear Utilization<br />\nTheory Strategy(NUTS)arguing that a nuclear war is<br />\nwinnable.<br />\nUp to this point, Warnke<br />\nsaid, \"the NUTS have been<br />\nahead,\" by chasing \"that will<br />\no' wisp of nuclear superiority.\"<br />\nWarnke also raised the question of what role nuclear<br />\nweapons play in military<br />\nstrategy. Warnke's answer was<br />\nto quote President Reagan's<br />\nState of the Union speech of<br />\nJanuary 1984 by saying that \"A<br />\nnuclear war cannot be won and<br />\nshould not be fought. The only reason to have nuclear<br />\nweapons is to make sure that<br />\nthey can never be used.\"<br />\nThis is a MAD point of view,<br />\n\"embracing\" deterence according to Warnke. Reagan's<br />\nrhetoric may \"stink\" but his<br />\nactions are reasonably sane on<br />\narms control, said Warnke.<br />\n\"The President may be<br />\nMAD, but he's not NUTS,\"<br />\nWarnke concluded from this.<br />\nWarnke then discussed the<br />\n\"rockheaded attitude\" that led<br />\nto the rejection of the SALT II<br />\nabout the<br />\ntreaty and<br />\nunfeasability of the SDI.

But there<br />\nis also another campus radio station in<br />\njeopardy: WA3EPT.<br />\nMost of you have probably never even<br />\nlistened to WA3EPT. For those who<br />\nhaven't, it is the station operated by the<br />\nHopkins Amateur Radio Club. The club<br />\nprovides students interested in ham radio<br />\nwith hands-on experience. They are able<br />\nto contact other radio buffs throughout<br />\nthe country and the world.<br />\nWA3EPT is in jeopardy because the<br />\nclub's current building\u2014the little shack<br />\nnext to the Gatehouse\u2014will soon be torn<br />\ndown to make room for an expansion of<br />\nthe Baltimore Museum of Art. The<br />\nuniversity has agreed to let the museum<br />\nbuild a new sculpture garden in the small<br />\ndell behind the Gatehouse. The deal was<br />\ncontingent upon the fact that this<br />\nnewspaper be allowed to keep its offices<br />\nin the Gatehouse, but the radio club will<br />\napparently be without a home.<br />\nWe realize there is no way to<br />\nreasonably accomodate the radio shack<br />\nwithin the design of the sculpture garden,<br />\nand the club's 30-foot antenna currently located in the dell certainly can't stay.<br />\nOur point is that a greater effort should<br />\ncertainly have been made to find a new<br />\n<br />\nlocation for the radio club.<br />\nWe know that won't be easy. The club<br />\nrequires an office of some sort to store<br />\nits equipment, and needs to be near an<br />\nopen area so antennae can be erected.<br />\nBut saving an active student group ought<br />\nto be a high priority for the administration (particularly at a school not known<br />\nfor active student groups).<br />\nWhether the university should have offered the land to the museum in the first<br />\nplace is a debatable(and now academic)<br />\nquestion. Admittedly the area is currently ugly, but it is a wonderful location for<br />\nthe radio club. Furthermore, it remains<br />\nto be explained what will be gained by<br />\nallowing the museum to use the area.<br />\n(Other, that is, than pleasing Robert and<br />\nRyda Levi, whose sculpture will be placed in the garden, and who just happen<br />\nto give loads of money to both the school<br />\nand the museum.)<br />\nThere is nothing wrong per se with<br />\nallowing the museum to use the dell. But<br />\nso far there has been little apparent effort to find a new location for the radio<br />\nclub. And there is definitely something<br />\nwrong with disregarding student interests<br />\nbecause somebody in Garland Hall<br />\ndecided to improve relations with the Art<br />\nMuseum.<br />\n<br />\nTo Boycott...<br />\nOr Not to Boycott<br />\nWhat's going on here? Hopkins<br />\nstudents are concerned with Apartheid?<br />\nSome are even willing to miss classes for<br />\nit? Amazing. Rarely does anybody<br />\naround here look past the next orgo test.<br />\nBut while it's certainly a blessing to see<br />\nstudents caring about something other<br />\nthan their studies, it isn't at all clear just<br />\nwhat a boycott of classes today will<br />\naccomplish.<br />\nThe issue of South Africa's institutional racism is, obviously, a complex<br />\nquestion deserving complex consideration. Should American institutions(most<br />\ndefinitely including this university) cease<br />\nto invest in that country? Is the current<br />\ngovernment worse than whatever would<br />\nfollow it, or is it better?(The latter is not<br />\nat all impossible. It was said for many<br />\nyears that there could be nothing worse<br />\nthan the Shah. We have something much<br />\nworse\u2014the Ayatollah.) How will this<br />\ncountry's interests be best served?<br />\nThe problem with a boycott is that it<br />\nwill contribute nothing to a debate of<br />\nthese issues. Instead, it will merely endorse a hopelessly vague assertion: Free<br />\nPrisoners of Apartheid. (The day has<br />\nbeen so designated by, among others, the<br />\nUnited Nations.)<br />\nIf the boycott would actually accomplish something, we might be in<br />\nfavor of it. Apartheid is clearly a barbaric system, and anyone unwilling to<br />\nvoice his moral repugnance to it is either<br />\nblatantly misinformed or blatantly<br />\nstupid. But to merely say you are in favor<br />\nof freedom is to say something so bland<br />\nas to be uninteresting and unimportant.<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps a worse problem with the<br />\nboycott, however, is that it reflects a<br />\ngreat moral asymmetry. There are literally dozens of countries around the world<br />\nwhich engage in heinous acts, which<br />\npersecute people for their race, their<br />\nreligion, their political beliefs. Are we to<br />\nhave boycotts about them all? Shall we<br />\nhave a day to demand the release of<br />\nprisoners in the Soviet Union? Or Chile?<br />\nOr Cuba? Or North or South Korea? We<br />\ncould probably make it through a whole<br />\nsemester without ever going to a class.<br />\nIt also ought to be noted, however,<br />\nthat a strikingly large number of students<br />\nsimply seem to have missed the point of<br />\nthe boycott. They whine about the<br />\nsacrifice of missing one day of class, apparently unaware of the obscenity of objecting to such an inconvenience when<br />\nseeking to aid people living under tyranny. Can't they see that what happens in<br />\nSouth Africa is slightly more important<br />\nthan getting a good grade in orgo lab?<br />\nNo wonder Hopkins students are known<br />\nfor being the finest examples of pre-med<br />\nsyndrome.<br />\nOur objection to the boycott isn't that<br />\nit's invariably wrong to boycott classes,<br />\nit's that it will do little to better the situation in South Africa, or to further our<br />\nunderstanding of it. Such a protest ought<br />\nto accomplish something. Naively saying<br />\nthat you're in favor of freeing the<br />\nprisoners of apartheid (who isn't?), particularly when you make no mention of<br />\natrocities being committed elsewhere,<br />\ndoesn't do anything constructive.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, I would like'to clarify<br />\nall misconceptions about the<br />\nevents taking place on Oct. 11,<br />\n1985, which has been<br />\ndesignated \"Free Prisoners of<br />\nApartheid Day.\" Most importantly, it should be noted that<br />\nthe Black Student Union is petitioning, organizing and sponsoring the boycott and educational forums that will take<br />\nplace Oct. 11, 1985. Moreover,<br />\n<br />\nplanned for the day. Indeed,<br />\nthere are many students (that<br />\nhave to go to class) who will be<br />\nmaking a stand against apartheid by participating in the<br />\neducational forums planned for<br />\nthe day.<br />\nI am grateful that the Student<br />\nCouncil had the courage to take<br />\na stand and come out and support the boycott. It is<br />\ndisheartening to realize that<br />\n<br />\ndarrell edward cook<br />\nthe boycott of classes is a<br />\nnation-wide event, in which<br />\nmany students of universities<br />\nand colleges across the United<br />\nStates will be participating.<br />\nSecond, there seems to be a<br />\nlot of confusion about the purpose and effectiveness of the<br />\nboycott. The purpose of the<br />\nboycott is simple\u2014it is a means<br />\nof mobilization in order to fight<br />\nthe apathy that exists on this<br />\ncampus and other _ campuses<br />\nabout apartheid. In addition to<br />\nthe boycott, there will be educational forums held which will<br />\nserve as a thought-provoking<br />\nmechanism in order to intensify<br />\nthe awareness about the atrocity that exists in South Africa.<br />\nIn reading last week's NewsLetter, I was shocked to<br />\ndiscover that many students<br />\nseem to`think that if they don't<br />\nboycott their classes, they will<br />\nbe in support of apartheid. Obviously, the student who has an<br />\nexamination or feels he or she<br />\nmust attend their classes should<br />\ndo so. However, this does not<br />\nmean that that particular student cannot support the<br />\nboycott and the other events<br />\n<br />\nthere are students here who<br />\nbelieve the sole purpose of the<br />\nStudent Council is to improve<br />\nstudent welfare. Now don't get<br />\nme wrong, I agree that the Student Council's main purpose is<br />\nto improve student welfare.<br />\nHowever, that does not mean<br />\nthe Student Council cannot endorse the activities of groups<br />\nhere at Hopkins.<br />\nI applaud the efforts of the<br />\nBlack Student Union and the<br />\nmany students who are participating in the events on Oct.<br />\nII, 1985. It is, indeed, a comfort to know that there are student groups and students here<br />\nat Hopkins who have the<br />\ncourage to stand up for what<br />\nthey believe is right and just. Indeed, by participating in this<br />\nnation-wide event, it is the goal<br />\nof the Black Student Union to<br />\nraise the consciousness of the<br />\nadministration, faculty and<br />\nstudents towards the problems<br />\nthat have existed for blacks in<br />\nSouth Africa for years.<br />\nThe writer is the Executive<br />\nChairperson of the Black Strident Union.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nEthan Rarick<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nMary Ginder<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nT.J.

According to the Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee on the Status of<br />\nWomen, much should be done.<br />\nAmong the recommendations was a call for the creation<br />\nof four new tenured faculty<br />\npositions created expressly for<br />\nwomen, and a women's study<br />\ncurriculum. Observations in-<br />\n<br />\nwelfare of women on campus.<br />\nYet, if the university follows all<br />\nthe recommendations of the<br />\ncommittee we risk being unfair<br />\nto some sides in the hope that<br />\nwe can be fair to other sides.<br />\nA major emphasis of the<br />\nreport deals with university<br />\nstaff involved in the academic<br />\naspect of the university. It is<br />\ntrue that women are seriously<br />\nunderrepresented when corn-<br />\n<br />\njoe chen<br />\neluded in the report maintain<br />\nthe fact that women at this<br />\nuniversity are basically involved in lower level service<br />\npositions which offer little or<br />\nno upward mobility. Thus they<br />\nrecommend revised hiring practices and admissions procedures, among other reforms.<br />\nThe committee further claimed<br />\nthat the university is indifferent<br />\nor hostile to the condition and<br />\n<br />\npared to their numbers in the<br />\ngeneral population or when<br />\ncompared to national averages<br />\nof women employed in this<br />\narea. This leaves Hopkins as a<br />\npredominantly male institution.<br />\nTo determine the underlying<br />\nreason for this, we must<br />\ndispose of the statistics and<br />\nlook at the causes of<br />\nthis imbalance.<br />\nMost of the blame is due to<br />\n<br />\ndoes nothing to help us mitigate<br />\nany of the division that surrounds it. Nevertheless, if we<br />\nunderstand the problem of<br />\nSouth Africa as consisting of<br />\nboth a moral and a practical<br />\ndimension, we will do better to<br />\nresolve what actions are appropriate for students, citizens,<br />\nand human beings.<br />\nThe problem of Apartheid is<br />\ncomposed of a practical and<br />\nmoral aspect--and it is the practical aspect which gives us the<br />\nmost trouble. This dimension<br />\nto the issue--the question of<br />\nwhat we as a nation ought to do<br />\nto change conditions in South<br />\nAfrica--is highly problematic. It<br />\nis virtually impossible to accurately predict the exact results<br />\nof any given action taken by a<br />\nnation in the geopolitical realm.<br />\nWe cannot foretell whether<br />\nspecific action taken to alter the<br />\ninternal order of another state<br />\n<br />\nmay ultimately prove to be<br />\neither effective, undesirable, or<br />\nsimply superfluous. It is over<br />\nthis uncertainty that most of the<br />\ndebate on Apartheid takes<br />\nplace; but the fact that we do<br />\ndebate is good, for perhaps in<br />\nso debating the uncertainty with<br />\nwhich we must contend will be<br />\novercome.<br />\nWhile the problems which<br />\nare posed by the practical issues<br />\nof Apartheid are legion, the<br />\nmoral dimension should be<br />\ncrystal clear. There can be no<br />\ndoubt that Apartheid as a<br />\npolitical and social system is<br />\nreprehensible. Thus, as<br />\nadherents to the notion of inalienable civil liberties, we must<br />\nuniformly oppose the theory<br />\nbehind and practice of any legal<br />\norder which systematically<br />\ndiscriminates against one class<br />\nof citizens in favor of another.<br />\nOn this point our voices must<br />\n<br />\nthe fact that orderly change<br />\nmust result from an evolutionary, rather than from a<br />\nrevolutionary process. In addition; social intrastructure<br />\nchanges much more slowly than<br />\nthe surface trends which influence it.

But these recent<br />\nevents indicate that such glimmers of sensibility are simply<br />\nabberations in an otherwise insensitive approach to student<br />\nrelations. The fact that the administration's inaction regarding the Radio Club is so inexplicable suggest that the gulf<br />\nbetween students and the administration is growing. Their<br />\nmotivations mystify us. This<br />\n<br />\ngoes beyond simple disagreement. We are at the point where<br />\nthe basic assumptions of one<br />\nside are not disputed by the<br />\nother; they are simply not even<br />\nrecognized. We expect concern<br />\nfor our problems.

In fact,<br />\nthey're rather curious<br />\nand friendly.\"<br />\n<br />\nEverybody at Hopkins<br />\nknows somebody who has had<br />\nthe opportunity to study<br />\nabroad. Usually they attend<br />\nschool in Italy or England or a<br />\nhost of other nations. But<br />\nDouglas Barnhart was a little<br />\ndifferent\u2014he went to Antarctica.<br />\nBarnhart was one of the six<br />\nScout finalists to be chosen for<br />\nthe journey. He left last<br />\nNovember and returned in<br />\nMay. Approximately four and<br />\na half of these months were<br />\nspent on board ship, a 400-foot<br />\nicebreaker. During the trip,<br />\nBarnhart held the status of<br />\nOfficer-in-Training, which is<br />\nthe equivalent of a senior at the<br />\nCoast Guard or Naval Academies. He learned how to<br />\nnavigate, and served as a<br />\ndelegate to the captain. He also<br />\nparticipated in on-board<br />\noceanographic experiments.<br />\nThe first Antarctic stop was<br />\nat the United States' Palmer<br />\nStation, on the peninsula. Barnnhart observed four species of<br />\nseals and two species of<br />\npenguins there. He said he really enjoyed this brief stop,<br />\nbecause it is the only place these<br />\nanimals exist on the continent.<br />\n\"The penguins aren't at all<br />\nintimidated by humans,\" said<br />\nBarnhart. \"In fact, they're<br />\nrather curious and friendly.\"<br />\nBut apparently penguins give<br />\noff an odor of sulfur that can<br />\n<br />\nbe detected long before one can<br />\nsee the nesting area.<br />\n\"You could always tell when<br />\nsomeone had been around<br />\npenguins,\" said Barnhart.<br />\nThe next and most important<br />\nstop was at McMurdo station,<br />\nwhere Barnhart would be doing<br />\nhis experiments. McMurdo is<br />\nfarther south along the coast,<br />\nand has about 1000 people<br />\nthere in the summer.(Remember that summer in the<br />\nSouthern Hemisphere is our<br />\nwinter.) Many people are in the<br />\nNavy; the rest are scientists or<br />\ncontracted workers.<br />\nThe main biology and<br />\ngeology labs are located at<br />\nMcMurdo, so a lot of research<br />\ngoes on there. Barnhart worked in a biochemistry lab, experimenting with anti-freeze<br />\nproteins in fish. His work had<br />\nan unusual twist to it\u2014he actually caught the fish himself<br />\nand prepared them for experimentation. Barnhart did<br />\nnot mind this at all because it<br />\nwas \"an opportunity to take<br />\nout the snowmobile.\"<br />\nBarnhart spent four days at<br />\nthe U.S. South Pole Station.<br />\nThe only work that can go on<br />\nthere is weather research, and<br />\nBarnhart suspected that the<br />\nreasons the U.S. has chosen to<br />\nmaintain a base there are more<br />\npolitical that scientific.

To<br />\nLucas, a freelance designer and<br />\nentrepeneur, jewelry is a<br />\nserious, and growing, business.<br />\n\"It all started in a crafts class<br />\nwhich I took in 9th grade,\" said<br />\nLucas. \"I decided I enjoyed<br />\nmaking things with my hands,<br />\nand I began to think about<br />\ndesigns for different things<br />\nwhich I could make. Eventually, I began to put some designs<br />\nwhich I had in my head, mostly for things like belt buckles,<br />\nonto paper. From there, all I<br />\n<br />\nhad to do was make them.\"<br />\nAlthough he enjoyed fashioning things in his crafts class, it<br />\nwasn't until later that his interest became a business. The<br />\nstory of Lucas'jewelry business<br />\nis in a sense the quintessential<br />\ncapitalist epic, the traditional<br />\njustification for free enterprise.<br />\n\"My older sister is a fashion<br />\ncommentator in New York. She<br />\nalways liked buying elaborate<br />\njewelry, and one day she came<br />\nhome with a pair of earrings<br />\nwhich cost her some crazy<br />\namount of money. I told her<br />\nshe was wasting her money,<br />\nthat I could make a pair just as<br />\ngood for a lot less. Well, inade<br />\nher a pair of earrings, and a few<br />\nof her friends asked her where<br />\nshe got them. They asked for a<br />\nfew pairs, then they told a few<br />\nfriends, and after a while it<br />\nbegan to take up a lot of my<br />\ntime. That's when I decided to<br />\nget organized.\"<br />\nAs good as Lucas is as a<br />\ndesigner, it is his organizational<br />\nskills which turned the hobby<br />\ninto a business. An uncle who<br />\nis a successful commercial artist<br />\ntaught him the importance of<br />\n<br />\nresearch and persistence, and<br />\nLucas decided it was time to<br />\nmove into the fine jewelry<br />\nmarket. He grew up in Bloomfield, New Jersey, not far from<br />\nNew York, and it was to New<br />\nYork that he had to go. The<br />\ncenter of the industry is on 47th<br />\nstreet in Manhattan, and Lucas<br />\nbegan making trips there to buy<br />\nthe gold, silver, and brass which<br />\nwould go into his creations.<br />\n\"When I started to put<br />\ntogether a portfolio, it became<br />\nimportant to have a sense of<br />\nwhat people would be wearing<br />\nduring a particular season. I<br />\nstarted to read a lot of high<br />\nfashion magazines, from which<br />\nI would get a general concept,<br />\nor a 'look'. Then I'd just think<br />\nof what would go with it, I'd<br />\ndraw it, and I'd make it.\"<br />\nAfter a while, he'd made a<br />\nvaried assortment of pieces,<br />\nranging from bracelets to cufflinks and ear clips. While a<br />\nstudent at the University of<br />\nMiami, he met a designer who<br />\nbegan to use some of his belts.<br />\nNot long afterwards, he began<br />\nmarketing in earnest.<br />\n\"Because I'm a freelance<br />\n<br />\ndesigner, I have to take the first<br />\nstep in getting my stuff into a<br />\nstore. When I see a store which<br />\nI thing will do a good job of<br />\nselling, and which will sell the<br />\njewelry at the price it's worth,<br />\nI call and set up an appointment to have the buyer looker<br />\neverything over. Then, if they<br />\nlike it, they'll place an order<br />\nfor, say, a dozen pairs of earrings and a few of everything<br />\nelse.\"<br />\nPart of Lucas' marketing<br />\nstrategy is to associate his name<br />\nwith his product. Everything he<br />\nmakes bears his discreet initials,<br />\nand all store displays group his<br />\nwork together as a special collection. He also keeps varying<br />\nhis designs, and never produces<br />\nmore than a few of each particular piece. Each piece is consequently more distinctive, and<br />\nLucas' work remains that of an<br />\nartist and not someone with a<br />\nfew designs trying to make a lot<br />\nof money fast.<br />\nLucas transferred to Hopkins<br />\nthis fall, after two and a half<br />\nyears at Miami. Although he<br />\nhad begun to sell his work in<br />\nsevLral fine jewelry stores in<br />\n<br />\nFlorida, his plans called for a<br />\nchange in location. Baltimore<br />\nmade sense for a variety of<br />\nreasons. \"When I was at<br />\nMiami, I kept having to fly to<br />\nNew York to get materials.<br />\nBaltimore/Washington is closer<br />\nto New York, and it's got a<br />\nmore accessible jewelry market<br />\nthan Miami.

If that's not bad<br />\nenough, he's gone two or three<br />\nweekends out of every four,<br />\ntravelling to cities like Atlanta<br />\nor New York, where he hopes<br />\nto broaden his selling base.

So, as well as<br />\nbeing a detective story, it is a<br />\nphilosophical novel of history.<br />\nIn the New York Times Book<br />\nReview, Eco was asked where<br />\nthe idea for the novel came.

In 1962 they made the<br />\nprovision that anyone who<br />\nchose to do research there could<br />\nbecome part of that treaty. All<br />\nwork done there was to be<br />\npurely scientific; there is no<br />\nnuclear testing, and no military<br />\nweapons.<br />\n\"There is great cooperation<br />\nbetween nations,\" Barnhart<br />\nsaid. \"Soviet and U.S. scientists work at each other's bases,<br />\nand share their work.<br />\nBarnhart heard about an occurence during the Falkland<br />\nIslands crisis.

The production is the<br />\nbest Marshall has ever gotten,<br />\ndefinitely, but makes him<br />\nsound just like any number of<br />\n\"roots\" bands currently clogging up the air at WHFS. This<br />\nrecord sits Marshall right along<br />\nside bands like the Blasters, Del<br />\nFuegos, Jason and the Scorchers, and of course T-Bone<br />\nhimself. That's all right but it<br />\nisn't really Marshall's natural<br />\nelement.

They're<br />\ngetting better in the songwriting<br />\ndepartment but there is<br />\nsomething severly lacking in the<br />\n\"freshness\" department.

On<br />\nthe one hand, there is no doubt<br />\nthat \"In Between Days\" is a<br />\nrip-off kind of a song. On the<br />\nother hand, the album and<br />\nsingle are pure Cure all the way<br />\nthrough\u2014ripping off everyone<br />\npossible including themselves.<br />\nThe result is a mish-mash of<br />\ncontemporary electro-pop. It's<br />\na progression from their last<br />\nalbum, The Top, but largely in<br />\nthe same style\u2014densely produced pop with a definite current of gloom running<br />\nthroughout. Smith is an experimenter and there are a few<br />\npleasant surprises on this<br />\nalbum\u2014the piano- syncopated<br />\n\"Six Different Ways\" and the<br />\npure synth-pop of \"Close to<br />\nMe\" but it's still fun to guess<br />\nwhich train Smith has jumped<br />\non on each song\u2014let's see,<br />\n\"Push\" is Ultravox, \"Screw\"<br />\nis Shriekback, etc. . .

Highest<br />\nRecommendation.<br />\n<br />\n\f18/OCTOBER /1, 198''<br />\n<br />\nPianist Horszowski Delights Shriver Audience<br />\n<br />\nby Jason Hanson<br />\nOn Sunday evening, October<br />\n6. 1985, pianist Mieczyslaw<br />\nHorszowski, who performed<br />\nShriver Hall Concert Series'<br />\ntwentieth season with a truly<br />\noutstanding performance of<br />\npiano works by several of the<br />\ninstrument's finest coposers.<br />\nHorszowski inaugurated the<br />\nduring the series' first season,<br />\nonce again delighted the whole<br />\nof Homewood's Shriver Hall<br />\naudience with his remarkable<br />\nability and the unaffected<br />\nwisdom with which he<br />\nperformed.<br />\nThe concert began with J.S.<br />\nBach's Prelude and Fugue in E<br />\nminor and was followed by the<br />\nPrelude and Fugue in A minor.<br />\nIn the fugue section of the lat-<br />\n<br />\nter, Horszowski demonstrated<br />\nthe reason for Bach's affinity<br />\nfor the piano, tempering the<br />\nrapidly converging and diverging voices of the two themes<br />\nwith subtle variations of<br />\ndynamics which, impossible on<br />\nthe harpsichord, are available<br />\nto the piano in an infinite variety to permit the proper shading<br />\nof a work.<br />\nTwo works of Domenico<br />\nScarlatti continued the program: the Sonata No. 3 in A<br />\nminor and the Sonata No. 20 in<br />\nE major. In the delightful<br />\ndescending figures of the A<br />\nminor sonata, Horszowski<br />\ncommunicated the true warmth<br />\nof these works which Scarlatti<br />\nentitled \"essercizi\" (literally<br />\ntranslated exercizes or etudes.)<br />\nHorszowski further established<br />\n<br />\nthe brilliance and color of these<br />\nshort pieces with his performances of the Sonata No. 20<br />\nclearly<br />\nhe<br />\nwherein<br />\nthese<br />\nthat<br />\nted<br />\ndemonstra<br />\nspirited, gay pieces were<br />\ndecidedly not the objects of a<br />\nschoolboy's drudgery.<br />\nNext on the program was<br />\nMozart's Fantasy in D major,<br />\nK.397, a work of tempermental moods that the composer,<br />\nthrough the license of the fantasy form, purposely kept from<br />\nattaining a definite cadential<br />\nresolution. Horszowski handled the delicate, lyrical \"arietta\"<br />\nthat begins the piece with the<br />\nutmost care, while playing the<br />\nintruding ominous and dirgeful<br />\nmeasures that break up this airy<br />\nmelody with equally convincing<br />\nlamentation. The inconstant<br />\n<br />\nmood of the Fantasy gives the<br />\npiece the capricious character<br />\nthat is typical of Mozart's<br />\nworks. This the pianist<br />\nacknowledged, but to his credit<br />\ndid not embellish.<br />\nThe last piece before the intermission was Mozart's Sonata<br />\nin D major, K.576, in three<br />\nmovements\u2014Allegro, Adagio,<br />\nand Allegretto. In the Allegro,<br />\nHorszowski demonstrated<br />\nMozart's true genius with his<br />\nbright crisp execution of the<br />\ndizzying upper voice while<br />\nmaintaining the grace and flow<br />\nof the smooth arpeggios in the<br />\naccompaniment. The pianist<br />\naccomplished the expressive<br />\nbeginning of the Adagio with<br />\nfull feeling and gave the occasional minor-key sentiments of<br />\nthe treble due consideration<br />\n<br />\nbefore striking a cheerful<br />\nbalance between the two<br />\ntoward the end of the movement. The Alegretto was announced with a pretentious<br />\nmelody concordant with<br />\nMozart's wit, in the playing of<br />\nwhich Horszowski neither<br />\npatronized Mozart nor the audience, while the melody an<br />\nhonest, but still delightful<br />\ninterpretation.<br />\nHorszowski opened the second half of the program with<br />\nBeethoven's Fifteen Variations<br />\nand Fugue in E-flat minor, Op.<br />\n35, subtitled \"Eroica.\" This<br />\npiece turned out to be the<br />\nhighlight of the evening. The<br />\n\"Intruduzione col basso del<br />\nTema\" commenced with a resounding bass chord which<br />\nContinued on Page 19<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar<br />\n\"IMPORTANT NOTICE\"<br />\nWe are in the process of expanding the coverage of the<br />\nArts Calendar to include more<br />\nstudent-relevant events.

Then, with<br />\ndeftness of execution, he<br />\nbrought forth with bright spontaneity the full-fledged melody<br />\nof the piece.<br />\nHorszowski displayed his<br />\nmastery at the piano in playing<br />\nthe variations with their widely<br />\nvarying character and moods of<br />\nmultifarious drama and intrigue. The first variation, an<br />\nintricate reworking of the main<br />\ntheme, Horszowski skillfully<br />\ndispatched. Following this,<br />\nHorszowski explored variations<br />\nwhich employed long arpeggios<br />\nin both registers; arpeggios in<br />\nthe accompaniment with<br />\ndelicate staccato counterpoint<br />\nin the upper registers, and<br />\nsmooth lyric melodies of expository nature, all of which<br />\nthoroughly enchanted the<br />\nShriver Hall audience.<br />\nHorszowski played the more<br />\nmirthful sections of the piece<br />\nwith humor and lightheartedness, but rose to the<br />\ntechnically difficult later variations with true virtuosity. He<br />\ngrandly rounded out the work<br />\nwith a spirited attack of the<br />\nfull-bodied final measures and<br />\nsignificantly<br />\nit<br />\nclosed<br />\nbass<br />\nmeaningful<br />\nwith the<br />\nrumbling with which it began.<br />\nThe two final pieces on the<br />\nprogram were the Polanaise in<br />\nC minor, Op. 40, No. 2, and<br />\nthe Bolero in C major, Op. 19,<br />\n<br />\nof Chopin. The second<br />\nPolanaise of Op. 40 embodies<br />\na melody of blackness and morbidity, feelings which pervade<br />\nmany of Chopin's works contemporary with this one.<br />\nHorszowski gave much grave<br />\nconsideration to the dark<br />\nmelody which opens the piece<br />\nand played with antipodal radiance the colorful, happy<br />\nmelody which temporarily<br />\ngains the Polonaise after many<br />\nspirited musical battles with the<br />\nfirst theme. However, after a<br />\nfinal pitched battle of Olympian dimension in which<br />\nHorszowski capably portrayed<br />\nthe essence of the contest between good and evil through<br />\nmetaphor, the<br />\nmelodic<br />\nPolonaise ends with the cryptic<br />\nmelody once more dominating.<br />\nThe enthusiasm of the<br />\nShriver Hall audience enjoined<br />\nMr. Horszowski to play an encore, and he gladly obliged with<br />\nNiendelssohn's Spring Songs<br />\nand Chopin's Op. 15, No. 2,<br />\nshowing no fatigue in their<br />\nperformance.<br />\nHis program free from ostentation and pretentiousness, Mr.<br />\nHorszowski affirmed that his<br />\ntrue virtuosity lies in his unfeigned, yet sagacious, performing<br />\nstyle.<br />\nIf Sunday evening's performance was any reflection at all<br />\nupon Mr. Horszowski's eightyseven years as a professional<br />\npianist, the world has been truly<br />\nblessed with the simple honesty of this greatly accomplished<br />\nmusician.<br />\n<br />\nMANAGE YOUR CAREER<br />\nWITH A<br />\nROC Pi<br />\n<br />\nTERM \u2022IEL<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nt the University of Rochester's Graduate School<br />\nof Management you can manage your career with a highly<br />\nrespected M.B.A. With our wide variety of financial aid and loan<br />\nprograms, you can manage your finances, too.

Pulitzer prize winner<br />\nGarry Trudeau has now come<br />\nout with the latest compilation<br />\nof his comic strip series, Check<br />\nYour Egos at the Door.<br />\nThe title is, as everyone<br />\nknows by now, a reference to<br />\nthe much publicized \"We Are<br />\nthe World\" recording sessions,<br />\nand it drew some criticism from<br />\nthose interpreting the reference<br />\nas a rather cynical attack on a<br />\ntruly humanitarian, philanthropic gesture. Lately,<br />\nDoonesbury has come under<br />\nsome more such criticism, from<br />\nthe people Trudeau chooses to<br />\nsatirize, but then, that's only<br />\nnatural when one chooses sides<br />\non controversial issues.<br />\n<br />\nEgos finds Mike Doonesbury<br />\nand wife J.J. still living at<br />\nWalden, and still very youngurban-professional.

Of course, everyone<br />\nelse's lives are also very much<br />\ntied in to the current social<br />\nscene, as when \"Subway Hero\"<br />\nMike has to cope with media<br />\nexaggeration, and Jimmy<br />\nThudpucker is called upon to<br />\nlend his voice to the \"We Are<br />\nthe World\" sessions (specifically for the `the').<br />\nWhich brings us back to the<br />\nquestions of cynicism, humor,<br />\ncontroversy, and bias. Sure,<br />\nTrudeau is biased (\"a whining<br />\nliberal bleeding heart,\" says<br />\none critic). Sure, if your views<br />\ndiffer, you will be annoyed.<br />\nGeorge Bush was rather perturbed at Trudeau's contention<br />\nthat manhood wouldn't draw<br />\nmuch interest since there wasn't<br />\nmuch capital to begin with<br />\nanyway. But give Trudeau a<br />\nbreak, he went to Yale. Had he<br />\ngotten a real education, he<br />\nmight have been more substantive. Blame it on the system.<br />\nPersonally, I think comics<br />\nshould be funny, whether they<br />\nbe about the deficit or the Sopwith Camel. As a comic strip<br />\nartist, Trudeau should be judged by his humor value, not by<br />\nhis thorough examination of all<br />\nthe facts, or how well he<br />\npresents an argument. No one,<br />\nwith the possible exception of<br />\nGerald Ford and his cabinet<br />\nreads the comic section for<br />\npolitical commentary, as no<br />\n<br />\nCheck Your<br />\nEgos at the Door<br />\n<br />\none reads Foreign Affairs for a<br />\nlaugh. In this respect, I must<br />\nsay that I found Egos to be funny. I laughed, my roommates<br />\nlaughed, you'll probably laugh.<br />\nIf you don't, you lose. $5.95 to<br />\nbe exact. If you buy it to gain<br />\nserious insight into politics,<br />\nyou're in pretty sad shape.<br />\n<br />\nLikewise, if you take offense.<br />\nOh yes, and even if you do<br />\nlose the $5.95, be content with<br />\nthe knowledge that Trudeau<br />\nhas agreed to donate all proceeds to USA for Africe.

When<br />\nthe thought does occur, it is a<br />\n<br />\nRzTit144/<br />\nJOHN NATHAN<br />\n<br />\njoke, a silly abstract, a \"slay\"<br />\non words\u2014we've all died of<br />\nembarrassment, been killed by<br />\ntests, murdered by our<br />\nroommates\u2014but in three<br />\nseconds we are resurrected an<br />\ngo on in our immortal fashion.<br />\nTo re,ad John Nathan's<br />\nMishima: A Biography from<br />\nthis youthful perspective is a<br />\ndisorienting and eerie experience. Drawing from<br />\nMishima's diaries and letters,<br />\ninterviews with family and<br />\nfriends, and his own personal<br />\nexperience as Mishima's<br />\ntranslator(The Sailor who Fell<br />\nfrom Grace with the Sea) and<br />\nas his friend, Nathan has produced a morbidly fascinating<br />\naccount of the Japanese<br />\nwriter's lifelong obsession with<br />\ndeath. Published in 1974, the<br />\nbook has been re-released to<br />\ncoincide with the opening of the<br />\nmovie Mishima by Paul<br />\n(American Gigilo,Taxi Driver)<br />\nSchrader.<br />\nYukio Mishima, Japan's<br />\nmost prominent postwar<br />\nnovelist, was born in Tokyo on<br />\nJanuary 14, 1925, and raised<br />\nuntil age twelve by his insane<br />\ngrandmother. During what<br />\nNathan depicts as a subnormal<br />\nchildhood, he cultivated a penchant for \"beauty, blood and<br />\ndeath\" and developed a passion<br />\nfor writing. At school<br />\nMishima's subtly perverse fiction and poetry drew an admiring audience, and by sixteen he<br />\nhad already been published in<br />\na magazine. The advent of<br />\nWorld War 11 heightened his<br />\n<br />\ndesire for a \"beautiful death,\"<br />\nbut he escaped the draft, being<br />\ndeclared physically unfit for duty. Mishima graduated with a<br />\nlaw degree from the Imperial<br />\nUniversity in 1947 and soon absorbed himself completely in his<br />\nwriting and his nihilistic fantasies. A three time contender<br />\nfor the Nobel Prize, Mishima<br />\nwas an extremely prolific and<br />\nversatile writer. He produced<br />\nforty novels, eighteen plays,<br />\ntwenty volumes of short stories<br />\nand essays, and more than a<br />\nhundred romantice hack novels<br />\nfor housewife consumption. By<br />\nthe mid-1950's, he was a national celebrity and flamboyant<br />\npublic figure. Like a displaced<br />\nAmerican rocker, he sported<br />\nHawaiian shirts, black pegged<br />\npants, sunglasses and a crew<br />\ncut. He was open about his<br />\nhomosexuality, but wed in<br />\n1958. He lifted weights<br />\nreligiously and starred in a<br />\ngangster movie. In the 1960's<br />\nMishima began to evolve a<br />\n\"patriotism\" that would provide him with the means and<br />\nfaith to achieve \"the rapture of<br />\ndeath,\" which he had sought<br />\nbefore all during his life in his<br />\nfantasies and his writing. Determined to became a man of action, he enlisted in Japan's Self<br />\nDefense Force in 1969 and soon<br />\nafter formed his \"Shield Society\" to protect the emperor. On<br />\nNovember 20, 1970, after exhorting the troops of the self<br />\nDefense Force to rise up and<br />\nuphold the emperor, he reached the climax of his lifelong<br />\n<br />\nobsession and committed seppuku (ritual suicide) in the Army headquarters.<br />\nNathan's biography is a convincing, well-written analysis of<br />\nMishima's complex desire to<br />\ndie. He refutes the argument<br />\nthat Mishima committed<br />\nsuicide out of insanity,<br />\nmasochism, or social protest\u2014<br />\nand maintains that his seppuku<br />\nwas the culmination of a<br />\nlifelong search in which \"Beauty, Ecstasy and Death were<br />\nequivalent and stood for his<br />\npersonal holy grail.\" Nathan<br />\nskillfully weaves throughout his<br />\nbiography<br />\nselections from Mishima's<br />\nworks that serve to support his<br />\nthesis.

Docter Stanley E. Order,<br />\nprofessor of radiation oncology<br />\nat The Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, recently announced<br />\nthat radiolabelled antibodies<br />\nhave caused significant remissions in patients with liver<br />\ncancer and Hodgkin's Disease.<br />\nThe fact that this treatment,<br />\nunlike chemotherapy or<br />\nsurgery, is almost symptomfree, makes this one of the most<br />\nexciting medical discoveries of<br />\nour time.<br />\nThe success of this treatment<br />\nrelies on the ability of these antibodies to distinguish cancer<br />\n<br />\ncells from normal tissue. Antibodies are molecules of the<br />\nimmune system that work by<br />\nrecognizing proteins called antigens on the surface of foreign<br />\ncells. When it encounters an antigen that is not native to the<br />\norganism, the antibody signals<br />\nother cells in the immune<br />\nsystem to enter and destroy the<br />\ninvading cells.<br />\nAntigens in an organism change<br />\nas a fertilized ovum divides,<br />\nand grows into a fetus. As<br />\nbillions of cells divide daily,<br />\nthey become organized through<br />\nbiochemical signals unique to<br />\neach organ. This process is called differentiation. In cancer,<br />\ncertain antigens normally present only in the early stages of<br />\ndevelopment reappear in the<br />\nrapidly dividing tumor cells.<br />\n<br />\nComprehensive Therapy<br />\nThe ohs ions radiation damage b) rat.watte,e antibodies is potential!) accompanied b) attraction of immune<br />\nDENSE<br />\nNEOvASCULATURE<br />\nf FERRITIN SYNTHESIS<br />\n<br />\nMODEST<br />\nNEOvASCuLAT uRE<br />\nMODEST<br />\nFERRITiN<br />\nSYNTHESIS<br />\n<br />\ncells called macrophages to the end of the antibo(t) molecule, called the 12c receptor, and b) the processing<br />\nof these macrophages with immune cell precursors, called T and B cells.

Two of these tumorrelated antigens are alpha-feto<br />\nprotein and ferritin.<br />\nWhile Dr. Order was studying at Harvard, he discovered<br />\na large concentration of ferritin<br />\nin the spleens of patients with<br />\nHodgkin's Disease.

The<br />\ndisease occurs when cells from<br />\nthe donor (the graft) attack<br />\ntissues of the recipient (the<br />\nhost), producing an intense and<br />\ndangeroud<br />\nimmunologic<br />\nresponse.<br />\nAbout 1,000 patients nationwide are candidates for bone<br />\nmarrow transplantation each<br />\nyear, all of whom must be<br />\ntreated with a variety of drugs<br />\nto ward off\u2014or treat\u2014GVHD.<br />\nSevere GVHD strikes an<br />\nestimated 30-50\u00b07o of transplant<br />\n/<br />\n4 of them.<br />\npatients, killing 30-503<br />\nGeorgia Vogelsang, M.D.,<br />\nand her team at Hopkins began<br />\nanimal studies of thalidomide's<br />\npossible use against GVHD<br />\nafter noting that Israeli researchers saw an unexpected benefit<br />\n<br />\nin patients with leprosy. Some<br />\nforms of leprosy produce<br />\nserious immune system<br />\nreactions.<br />\nAlthough the Hopkins<br />\nresearchers do not yet know the<br />\nprecise way thalidomide works<br />\nto suppress or damp down immune reactions, they suspect<br />\nthe drug afffects the activity of<br />\na special group of white blood<br />\ncells, called T4 helper cells, that<br />\nnormally bolster the immune<br />\nsystem's response to \"foreign\"<br />\ncells.<br />\nEuropean pharmoceutical<br />\ncompanies tested thalidomide<br />\nfor its sedative effects in<br />\nlaboratory rats during the<br />\n1950's, and found no evidence<br />\nthat it caused birth defects.<br />\nThe drug became available<br />\nwithout prescription in West<br />\nGermany in 1958, and was<br />\navailable by prescription in<br />\nCanada, Great Britain, Portugal, Australia, and New<br />\nZealand. A cautious Food and<br />\nDrug Administration kept the<br />\ndrug off the market in the U.S.<br />\nPhysicians soon began to see<br />\nincreased incidence of an<br />\nunusual<br />\nbirth<br />\ndefect\u2014<br />\nphocomelia\u2014a shortening or<br />\nelimination of the long bones of<br />\nthe arms and, in some cases, the<br />\nlegs, resulting in flipperlike<br />\n<br />\nlimbs.<br />\nBefore its 1962 withdrawal<br />\nfrom the world market,<br />\nthalidomide was estimated to<br />\nbe involved in up to 6,000<br />\ndefective births.<br />\nThe drug's immunosuppressive action was discovered<br />\nin 1965 when it was administered as a sedative to patients in Israel with a severe<br />\nsystemic form of leprosy. The<br />\nphysician noted that the<br />\ndisease's skin sores waned after<br />\nonly a few days of thalidomide<br />\ntreatment, and effect which<br />\nusually took months to accomplish using other drugs.<br />\nIn 1980, Hopkins inthat<br />\nvestigators<br />\nfound<br />\nthalidomide is converted in the<br />\nbody to a chemical derivative,<br />\ncalled an arene matabolite,<br />\nwhich causes damage to<br />\ndeveloping embryos. Conversion of thalidomide occurs in<br />\nthe liver tissue of humans,<br />\nmonkeys and rabbits, but not in<br />\nrats, the only species tested for<br />\nthese effects during the drug's<br />\npremarketing tests.<br />\nIn the Hopkins study, 17 of<br />\n22 rats pretreated with<br />\nthalidomide did not develop<br />\nGVHD, reports Vogelsgang.<br />\nConfirmed on Page 23<br />\n<br />\nconcentration in the cancer<br />\ntissue, if an antibody to ferritin<br />\ncould be made, it would attack<br />\nonly the cancer tissue, and not<br />\nthe normal tissue. This was accompolished by injecting rabbits with ferritin, so that their<br />\nimmune system would produce<br />\nantibodies to it. By labelling<br />\nthis antiferrin antibody with<br />\nradioactive iodine, it was shown<br />\nthat it bound primarily to the<br />\ntumor cells, and not to normal<br />\ntissue. This factor is part of<br />\n<br />\nwhat Dr. Order terms the<br />\n\"biologic window;\" the properties of tumors which cause<br />\nthe antiferritin antibody to bind<br />\nthere, despite the fact that normal tissue also contains ferritin.<br />\nOther factors of this \"window\"<br />\nare the new vasculature in<br />\ntumors, which lack smooth<br />\nmuscle, and the slower blood<br />\nflow.

The surgeons then<br />\nuse bone or cartilage grafts<br />\nfrom other parts of the body to<br />\nrestructure the face. For example, a small girl with two<br />\nmisshapen ears on one side of<br />\nthe face was operated on at<br />\n<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n\"First the cartilage, resembling a gnarled ball, was removed,\" explains Dufresne, who<br />\nperformed the surgery. \"We<br />\nleft some skin and extra tissue.<br />\nThen cartilage was taken from<br />\nthe ribs and an ear was carved<br />\nor whittled. The carved cartilage was placed under the skin<br />\nflap and the skin conformed,\"<br />\nhe continues. Reshaping both<br />\nears and relocating one would<br />\ninvolve<br />\ntypically<br />\nthree<br />\nseparated surgeries.<br />\nMany children are born with<br />\ncleft anomalies, such a cleft lip<br />\nor cleft palate, which result<br />\nwhen the lip and palate bone<br />\nitructures fail to fuse properly<br />\nJuring fetal development.<br />\nHowever, some children suffer<br />\nfrom rare cranial disorders that<br />\ncause severe deformities.<br />\nHypertension is characterized<br />\nby inordinately wide separation<br />\nbetween the eyes.

Indeed, the Ursinus<br />\nand Muhlenberg games will set<br />\nthe tone for the rest of the<br />\nseason.<br />\n<br />\nThe loss to Gettysburg was a<br />\nheartbreaker. It was a winable<br />\ngame, agrees the majority of<br />\nthe team. If someone would<br />\nhave told Coach Jerry Pfeifer<br />\nthat his defense would surrender only one touchdown, he<br />\nwould have assumed a victory.<br />\nGranted offensively the squad<br />\ndoes not have it all together yet,<br />\nand granted, Mark Campbell<br />\nhas yet to prove his potential;<br />\nbut with Brad McLam back for<br />\nhis first game and Tom Finegan<br />\ncatching close to ten passes a<br />\ngame, the Jays could definitely<br />\nscore some points...well, probably score points. . .okay,<br />\nmaybe not.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS DEFENSIVE STATS<br />\n<br />\nTackles<br />\n<br />\nArtfitch<br />\nHirshman<br />\nByrd<br />\nRyan<br />\nKalup<br />\nKwiatkowski<br />\nParadakis<br />\nLansinger<br />\nCardwell<br />\nSchell<br />\nTully<br />\nShalley<br />\n<br />\nSolo<br />\n14<br />\n10<br />\n10<br />\n10<br />\n9<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n3<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nAssisted<br />\n39<br />\n30<br />\n29<br />\n25<br />\n21<br />\n23<br />\n22<br />\n15<br />\n9<br />\n12<br />\n11<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nTotal<br />\n53<br />\n40<br />\n39<br />\n35<br />\n30<br />\n25<br />\n23<br />\n21<br />\n15<br />\n15<br />\n12<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nAssisted<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nTotal<br />\n5<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nSacks<br />\n<br />\nByrd<br />\nParadak is<br />\nKalup<br />\nSchell<br />\nRyan<br />\nTully<br />\nThomas<br />\nKwiatkowski<br />\nSokolowski<br />\nArtfitch<br />\n<br />\nSolo<br />\n4<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nByrd<br />\nHirshman<br />\nRyan<br />\nTully<br />\nKwiatkowski<br />\nRayner<br />\n<br />\nRecovered<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nInterceptions<br />\n<br />\nHirshowan<br />\nSchell<br />\nCardwell<br />\nArtfitcb<br />\n<br />\nNumber<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nTotal Yds.<br />\n49<br />\n22<br />\n26<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshaft<br />\n<br />\nFor the Cridders to be sucessful on Saturday, captains Mark Campbell<br />\nand Brad McLam will have to pick up a quiet offensive attack. McLam<br />\nis now within 100 yards of becoming JHU's all-time leading rusher.<br />\n<br />\nfield, Gettysburg took over<br />\npossession and drove 53 yards<br />\non eight plays. The big play was<br />\nan off tackle counter that went<br />\n30 yards to the 18 yard line.<br />\nFour different Blue Jays missed tackles on the play. Three<br />\nplays later, the Bullets led 7-0.<br />\nEarly in the third quarter,<br />\nHopkins handed Gettysburg<br />\nanother score. After trading<br />\npunts, Hopkins took over<br />\npossession on its own one yard<br />\nline. After moving the ball three<br />\nyards on two plays, the Jays<br />\nhad third down and seven from<br />\nthe four yard line. Then came<br />\nan option left. It seemed as if<br />\nCoach Pfeifer has his finger<br />\nstuck on the option button...and this one cost him.<br />\nCampbell was hit trying to<br />\npitch the ball and the fumble<br />\nwas recovered by Gettysburg in<br />\nthe end zone, 13-0.<br />\nThe defense showed a little<br />\npride late in the third quarter<br />\n<br />\nwhen Gettyburg threatened to<br />\nmake the game a blowout.<br />\nWith a fourth down from the<br />\nthree yard line, Gettysburg<br />\nwent off tackle left but the<br />\ndefense stopped them on the<br />\none.<br />\nPfeifer used the 'hook and<br />\nladder' to get the offense out of<br />\nits own end and create a spark<br />\nfor the squad. Campbell hit<br />\nFinegan on a curl pattern who<br />\nlateraled to McLam who was<br />\nbrought down at the Hopkins<br />\n37 yard line. But the spark died<br />\nand the teams traded punts for<br />\nthe entire fourth quarter and<br />\nthe game ended 13-0.<br />\nSo now the Jays have Ursinus tomorrow on the turf at<br />\n1:30. Maybe this will be that<br />\ngame when the offense explodes. The odds are that it will<br />\nbe. Campbell is due. The offensive line is due. The receiving<br />\ncorps is due. The defense?

However, the unit<br />\nknows it is better than what it<br />\nhas shown. It seems as if<br />\neveryone on the team is waiting<br />\nfor the game when it all comes<br />\ntogether.<br />\n\"I know we haven't played<br />\nup to our potential,\" said offensive tackle Jim Davis. \"We<br />\nare having problems with consistency. One lineman will have<br />\na good game but another will<br />\nhave a bad one.\"<br />\nDefensively, the Jays had a<br />\ntough time with the Gettysburg<br />\nrunning attack, surrendering<br />\n292 yards of the ground. But<br />\nthat was a given before the<br />\ngame. The forte of the squad is<br />\npass defense. The Jays were<br />\nnumber one in pass defense last<br />\nseason and well on the way to<br />\nrepeating. Stopping the Gettysburg running game was going to be tough. The defense<br />\ndid give up yardage but when it<br />\ncame time to toe the line, the<br />\nJays held it.<br />\n\"They were by far the<br />\nstrongest offensive team we've<br />\nfaced but they were predictable,\" said cornerback Jim<br />\nCardwell. \"It was some bending but we didn't break.\"<br />\nGettysburg's first touchdown<br />\ncame with only 45 seconds remaining in the first half.

Although outshot 15-12, the team held strong<br />\non defense and thwarted a potent Badger attack. Freshman<br />\nsweeper Matt Lawrence played<br />\na particularly strong game,<br />\nmaking numerous clears in<br />\ncritical situations.

This large invitational showcased the team's<br />\nbest performance of the year.<br />\nWhat makes this feat so impressive were the unforeseen<br />\ndisturbances the Jays had to endure before getting to the race.<br />\nThe first inconvenience faced by the team dealt with the<br />\nmode of transportation. At the<br />\nlocal car rental for the team's<br />\nreserved van, coach Eleanor<br />\nSimonsick was told \"No can<br />\ndo\" by Mr. Rent-A-Car. Instead of the van, a station<br />\nwagon took a portion of the<br />\nsquad while the remaining went<br />\nwith coach Gary Green.<br />\nTravelling in overcrowded<br />\ncars, the team was making good<br />\ntime as they headed for the<br />\nmeet. Unfortunately, the god of<br />\ntransportation was not on their<br />\n<br />\nside. About five miles from<br />\nGeorge Mason University,<br />\ndisaster struck. One of the lady<br />\nJays suffered from nausea and<br />\nits unwelcome outcome. Abandoning the rented station<br />\nwagon on the side of the road,<br />\nthe Jays were shuttled to the<br />\nmeet in the remaining car.<br />\nDue to the unexpected circumstances, the squad arrived<br />\nonly minutes before the start of<br />\nthe race. Unfamiliar with the<br />\ncourse and not fully warmedup, the Jays ran the race with<br />\nguts.<br />\nRunning hard and fast,<br />\nMaureen Shea recorded the best<br />\ntime for the Jays, running the<br />\n3-mile course in 18:33. Following Shea by 11 seconds was a<br />\nnew and imprproved Cecilia<br />\nKing. After King were Suzi<br />\nMcGinn in 19:30, Anita Kim in<br />\n19:44, and Tami Oki in 20:19.<br />\nRounding out the Magnificent<br />\nSeven were Sindee Gozansky in<br />\n20:03 and Karen Grissmer in<br />\n<br />\nKennedy To Lead Jays<br />\nby Adam Warner<br />\nThe Hopkins swim team will<br />\nrace into a new direction in the<br />\n'85-'86 season as George Kennedy, Jr., replaces Tim Welsh<br />\nas coach of both the men's and<br />\nwomen's teams.<br />\nThe 30-year-old Kennedy<br />\ncomes to JHU from Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference rival Gettysburg College, where he<br />\nserved for five years as head<br />\ncoach and turned a mediocre<br />\nprogram into a Division III<br />\nforce. His women's teams won<br />\nfour MAC championships during his tenure, while his men's<br />\nsquads finished second to<br />\nHopkins each season. Kennedy<br />\ncompiled an overall dual meet<br />\nprorecord of 79-29-1, and<br />\nduced 24 MAC Individual<br />\nchampions, 20 NCAA AllAmericans, and 41 National<br />\nQualifiers.<br />\nAccording to Athletic Direc-<br />\n<br />\ntor Bob Scott, \"We were extremely pleased to get a coach<br />\nof George Kennedy's talent and<br />\nability to come to Hopkins and<br />\ngive us the direction towards<br />\ncompeting for the Division III<br />\nnational championship.\"<br />\n\"Not only is he an outstanding coach, but he is an excellent recruiter as well,\" Scott<br />\nadds.<br />\nIn assuming the Blue Jay<br />\nhelm, Kennedy will attempt to<br />\nfill some pretty big shoes,<br />\nnamely those of his two immediate predecessors here at<br />\nHopkins.

The<br />\nMason meet also enabled the<br />\nJays to prove themselves after<br />\ntheir disappointing dual meet<br />\nagainst Gettysburg.

Anything<br />\ncould happen.<br />\nAt the start of the race, Jay<br />\nHarriers Maureen Shea and<br />\nMolly Bardsley were in the<br />\nlead. At the one mile marker,<br />\nShea was still in front, but then<br />\nshe lost her lead and she only<br />\nmanaged to finish 12th overall.<br />\nAs Green said, \"This was not<br />\nMaureen's day.\"<br />\nIn spite of all the commotion<br />\non the trail, Bardsley finished<br />\nin first place, followed by King<br />\nin 3rd, McGinn in 5th, Gozansky in 10th and the bewildered<br />\nShea in 12th. Also finishing<br />\nstrong for the Jays were Lucy<br />\nWilson in 13th and Nonnie<br />\nEstella in 15th. The final<br />\ntabulation of the score gave<br />\nGettysburg a 3 point edge over<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe Jays' next meet is tomorrow at 2:00 up at the track. Facing opponents from Lebanon<br />\nValley and Ursinus, this meet<br />\nshould be fun if it provides only half the excitement of last<br />\nweek's meets. Added incentive<br />\nto view is that male Harriers<br />\nare due to perform against their<br />\nopponents from said schools.<br />\nSpectators will be able to see<br />\nharrier George (Electric) Raiser<br />\nas he hopes to continue his winning form last shown when he<br />\nunmercifully trashed cornpetitiors from Swarthmore.<br />\n<br />\nAfter a sluggish start, the Netsters have begun to swing into form in their<br />\n1985 campaign. They recorded a dramatic 5-4 win over Mt. St. Mary's<br />\nthis past week.<br />\n<br />\nNetsters S lit Pair<br />\nby Hanmin Lee<br />\nLack of consistency still<br />\nseems to be the main problem<br />\nfor the lady Netsters as they<br />\ncontinued their up and down<br />\nplay last week. It started well as<br />\nHopkins edged a very tough<br />\nMt. St. Mary's team, 5-4, but<br />\nended on somewhat of a sour<br />\nnote as the Jays lost to a much<br />\nweaker Catholic University<br />\nsquad.<br />\nThe away match against Mt.<br />\nSt. Mary's proved to be what<br />\ncoach Kay Fowler Dressler called \"the highlight of the year so<br />\nfar.\" The Jays played some<br />\ngutsy tennis to split the singles,<br />\n3-3. All three singles matches<br />\nwon by Hopkins were 3-setters,<br />\nan indication of their mental<br />\ntoughness. Kathy March won at<br />\nno. 2 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. FowlerDressler commented, \"I told her<br />\nwe needed a win before the<br />\nmatch and she got it. Kathy just<br />\nplayed really well.\"<br />\nVictories at singles also came<br />\nfrom no. 4 Monica Canilang<br />\nwho posted a tough 7-6, 6-2, 7-6<br />\nwin and Huong Pham who won<br />\n4-6, 6-3, 6-3. No. 1 Kay Nelson,<br />\nand no. 5 Brigid Joyce all lost<br />\nin straight sets.<br />\nTied at 3-all, Hopkins needed to win 2 of 3 in doubles to<br />\npost its 4th victory. Nelson and<br />\n<br />\nMarch won a key match at first<br />\ndoubles, 6-4, 7-5, while Emmick<br />\nand Joyce dropped their no. 2<br />\ndoubles match. Matches were<br />\ntied at 4-all and the outcome<br />\nhinged on no. 3 doubles.<br />\nCanilang and Pham would easily be winners. However, when<br />\nCanilang twisted her ankle, it<br />\nseemed that Hopkins would<br />\nhave to default. But with tears<br />\nin her eyes, and tape on her<br />\nankle, Canilang continued.<br />\nCanilang and Pham managed<br />\nto take the 2nd set 7-5, locking<br />\nup a win for the Jays.<br />\nIn their next match, a home<br />\ncontest against Catholic<br />\nUniversity, the Jays played<br />\nuninspired tennis, perhaps a<br />\nresult of a letdown after their<br />\nvictory over Mt. St. Mary's.<br />\nOne bright spot was the continued good play of Huong<br />\nPham, who is still undefeated<br />\non the year. The only other<br />\nwinners were Captain Kay<br />\nNelson at no. 1, and the first<br />\ndoubles team of Nelson and<br />\nMarch.<br />\nThe State Tournament is<br />\ntomorrow and Saturday, and a<br />\nrematch against Mt. St. Mary's<br />\nis likely. Coach Fowler-Dressler<br />\nhas been pointing to this tournament all fall, and she hopes<br />\nthat Hopkins will be able to win<br />\nits 4th straight state title.<br />\n<br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nSaturday, October 12<br />\nFootball vs. Ursinus<br />\n1.30 p.m. (H)<br />\nMen's and Women's Cross Country vs. Lebanon Valley<br />\nand Ursinus<br />\n2.00 p.m.(H)<br />\nTuesday, October 15<br />\nField Hockey vs. UMBC<br />\n<br />\nTOO p.m. (H)<br />\n<br />\nWednesday, October 16<br />\nSoccer vs. Western Maryland<br />\nTOO p.m. (H)<br />\nWomen's Tennis vs. Franklin and Marshal13:30 p.m.(H)<br />\nVolleyball vs. Sheppard and Catholic. .6:00 p.m. (H)<br />\nThursday, October 17<br />\nField Hockey vs. Haverford<br />\n<br />\n4.00 p.m.(A)<br />\n<br />\n\f26/OCTOBER 11, 1985<br />\n<br />\nKlink Hat Trick Leads Hocksters Past Trinity<br />\nby Laura Perlinn<br />\n<br />\nTom Barthel<br />\n<br />\nCo-captain Carol Butterworth looks to stick the ball upfield in the<br />\nHocksters big win over Hood on Tuesda)r.<br />\n<br />\nThe women's varsity field<br />\nhockey team finally 'clicked'<br />\nlast week, trouncing Trinity and<br />\nHood 7-2 and 3-0, respectively.<br />\nThe only sad note was a disappointing 2-1 loss in double<br />\novertime to Mt. St. Mary's.<br />\nThe Trinity game was played<br />\non a muddy field in a light rain,<br />\nbut the Jays' spirits were soaring. Alicia Collins tallied the<br />\nfirst two goals of the game on<br />\npenalty strokes, after the Trinity goalkeeper twice fouled to<br />\nprevent Hopkins from scoring.<br />\nHeather Klink replied with a<br />\nhat trick, slamming the ball into the cage on three separate occasions. Kacie White and Jennifer Kenoian each added one<br />\npoint for the Lady Jays. April<br />\nSavoye, Jackie Fatula, and<br />\n<br />\nKenoian all had assists. The<br />\nseven total goals broke<br />\nHopkins' record for number of<br />\ngoals scored in one game.<br />\nThe team then traveled to<br />\ntake on Mt. St. Mary's.<br />\nHopkins got on the board first<br />\nwith a goal from Collins midway through the first half. The<br />\nopponents tied it up in the second half and sent the game into overtime. After a scoreless<br />\nfirst overtime period, a second<br />\nten minutes period was played,<br />\nin which Mt. St. Mary's grabbed the 2-1 lead it never lost.<br />\nStill, the hocksters played a<br />\nwell-fought game with many<br />\nscoring opportunities.<br />\nOn October 8, the Jays<br />\navenged their loss to Mt. St.<br />\nMary's by soundly defeating<br />\nHood 3-0. The first two goals<br />\nwere scored by April Savoye off<br />\n<br />\npenalty corners. Patti Ordonez,<br />\nwho had been psyched to score<br />\nall game, added an insurance<br />\ngoal late in the second half. The<br />\ndefense played an excellent<br />\ngame, too, and with several<br />\nspectacular saves from goalie<br />\nAmy Zimmerman, held Hood<br />\nscoreless.<br />\nThe hocksters' next game is<br />\nagainst UMBC and will be<br />\nplayed at 7:00 pm on Tuesday,<br />\nOctober 15, on Homewood<br />\nField.

Eisenhower<br />\nwho died in May. The lecture<br />\nseries is the only \"living<br />\nmemorial\" to Eisenhower said<br /><br />\nBrad Marks, co-chairman of<br />\nthe Symposium along with<br />\nMike DeRosa.<br />\nDuring the course of this session called,\"Arms Control, the<br />\nAnswer,\" both men discussed<br />\nthe current problems in arms<br />\ncontrol such as the need for<br />\nStar Wars, President Reagan's<br />\nStrategic Defense Initiative<br />\n(SDI) to develop a defense<br />\nagainst nuclear missiles through<br />\nhigh technology. Another problem that drew comments from<br />\nboth speakers was Soviet<br />\nPremier Mikhail S. Gorbachev's<br />\noffer to reduce their existing<br />\nnuclear weaponry by 50 percent<br />\nin exchange for a commitment<br />\nfrom the U.S. to stop the SDI<br /><br />\nand reduce their weapons to the<br />\nsame level.<br />\nMcGovern and Warnke each<br />\ntalked about the subjects that<br />\nconcerned them the most.<br />\nMcGovern restated his campaign themes of the nuclear<br />\nfreeze and the cancellation of<br />\nthe MX missile program. Warnke spoke of the stupidity of<br />\nthe failure of the U.S. to ratify<br />\nthe SALT II treaty, plus the<br />\nneed for further arms control<br />\nagreements.<br />\nIn honor of Milton<br />\nEisenhower and his brother,<br />\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower,<br />\nMcGovern said, \"They are the<br />\nkind of men I admired.\"<br />\nDwight Eisenhower and his<br /><br />\nVP Post Subject of Debate<br />\nAfter Frosh Primary Election<br />\nby Jon Stempel<br />\nA victory for Grace Kung in<br />\nthe race for freshmen class<br />\nsecretary and a controversy in<br />\nthe race for the class's vicepresident marked Tuesday's<br />\nfreshman elections.<br />\nKung easily defeated her two<br />\nrivals for secretary, Marty<br />\nOberle and Robert Schuster, by<br />\ncapturing 257 votes, nearly<br />\nfifty-seven percent of the 454<br />\nballots that freshmen cast.<br />\nIn the race for vice-president,<br />\naccording to Elections Committee Chairman Scott Turner,<br />\ncandidate Cary Gross was<br />\ndissatisfied with the EC's<br />\ndeclaration of a run-off<br />\nbecause, while he did not<br />\nreceive a majority of the votes<br />\ncast, he outpolled the other<br />\ncandidate, Wayne Myslik,<br />\n204-120, and believes he deserves<br />\n.ed to win. Turner said that<br /><br />\nGross was planning to file a<br />\nprotest to the EC.<br />\nTurner said that a candidate<br />\nmust have received \"a clear fifty percent plus one majority\"<br />\nof the total number of votes<br />\ncast in order to win his race.<br />\nBecause 454 votes were cast<br />\nfor all offices except representative and 1,005 votes were cast<br />\nfor representative, a candidate<br />\nfor all offices except representative had to receive 228 votes<br />\nto win, while a representative<br />\ncandidate had to receive 503<br />\nvotes to win. An abstention, according to Turner, counted in<br />\nall races except the race for<br />\nrepresentative as a vote cast.<br />\nGross argued, \"My immediate reaction was disbelief<br />\nbecause I was told by a member<br />\nof the Election Committee that<br />\nthis would be the final election<br />\nfor the vice-presidency. The<br />\npurpose for a primary in any<br /><br />\nelection for office is to narrow<br />\nthe field of candidates to two.<br />\n\"Although the rules say that<br />\nsomeone needs a fifty percent<br />\nplus one majority for him to<br />\nwin in the primaries,\" continued Gross, \"that rule was<br />\nobviously mandated for situations in which there are more<br />\nthan two candidates. Common<br />\nsense would dictate that when<br />\nyou have only two candidates<br />\nto begin with, only one election<br />\nis necessary.\"<br />\nMyslik contended, \"Considering the validity of the rules<br />\nof the Elections Committee, I<br />\nfeel it would be at this time<br />\npointless to argue because-any<br />\nchanges that would be made<br />\ncould not affect an election that<br />\nhas already taken place.\"<br />\n\"As for Cary's protest,\"<br />\ncontinued Myslik, \"both Cary<br />\nContinued on Page 5<br /><br />\nbrother understood the dangers<br />\nof the arms race and if<br />\nEisenhower were still President<br />\nand his brother still advising<br />\nhim, there \"would not be a<br />\ntwo-hundred billion dollar annual deficit and a two trillion<br />\ndollar national debt stemming<br />\nin large part from military programs like Star Wars and the<br />\nMX missile.\"<br />\nMcGovern stated,\"This<br />\nSymposium addresses the<br />\ntranscendent issue of our age:<br />\nsaving our civilization from<br />\nnuclear annihilation.\"<br />\nMcGovern then proceeded to<br />\ngive the history of what he<br />\ntermed, \"Reagan's perceived<br />\n'window of vulnerability' for<br /><br />\nAmerica concerning Soviet<br />\nnuclear strength.\" He concluded that Star Wars, if it is being<br />\nused as a bargaining chip for<br />\nnegotiation with the U.S.S.R.,<br />\nit is a \"bad bargain\" especially since \"most respected scientists in the U.S. have no faith<br />\nin Star Wars.\"<br />\nGorbachev's offer to cut existing nuclear weapons in exchange for Star Wars is \"too<br />\ngood to be true,\" said<br />\nMcGovern.<br />\n\"The United States should<br />\nfollow up Gorbachev's offer<br />\nwith a four-point comprehensive plan for arms control,\"<br />\nContinued on Page 9<br /><br />\nWhat's Inside<br />\nWho says Hopkins students<br />\ndon't do interesting things?<br />\nAs part of a program for<br />\nEagle Scouts, Douglas<br />\nBarnhart spent two-and-ahalf months in Antarctica last<br />\nyear.

Included among<br />\nthese are Spring Fair, Orientation, and athletic events supported by the classes. According to Rich Pan, a member of<br />\nthe SAC committee, \"There is<br />\na need to investigate these other<br /><br />\nexpenses.\"<br />\nFormer HOP chairman Mike<br />\nDeRosa also voiced concern<br />\nthat the cost of providing entertainment is increasing faster<br />\nthan the class budgets. \"Going<br />\naway from beer programming,<br />\nyou need good entertainment to<br />\ndraw people to events,\" he<br />\nclaimed. Sophomore Class<br />\nRepresentative Jenny Stahl<br />\nonly<br />\nthe<br />\nthat<br />\nadded<br />\neconomically feasible way to<br />\norganize social events is \"cosponsorship or to have the<br />\nHOP take over everything.\"<br />\nThe funding problem also extends to lecture series and the<br />\nMSE Symposium. \"The community and university divisions<br />\nlook to us for entertainment.\"<br />\nDeRosa said, \"and it is a reflection of the university when people say the students can't bring<br />\nbig names [to lecture] on<br />\ncampus.\"<br />\nThe council also named Little as chairperson of the ad-hoc<br />\ncommittee by a vote of 8-4-1. A<br />\nreport is to be made to the<br />\ncouncil on the results by the end<br />\nof the semester.<br />\nAlso at the council meeting:<br />\n\u2022Members of the JHU<br />\nHouse of Commons submitted<br />\na letter to the council expressing their dissatisfaction with the<br />\nresolution that was recently<br />\npassed supporting the boycott<br />\nof classes today as a symbol of<br />\nprotest against apartheid. The<br />\nletter stated that the council<br />\n\"acted inappropriately...and<br />\nshould not take positions on<br /><br />\nnon-campus, political issues.\"<br />\nAlso in the letter, the House<br />\nof Commons said that it<br />\nbelieves that council should<br />\nfunction only in regards to<br />\n\"campus issues such as<br />\nacademics and student life. If<br />\nmembers of student council feel<br />\nstrongly about a non-campus<br />\nissue, they should put forward<br />\na referendum for approval by<br />\nthe student body.<br />\nThe council defended its action by declaring that nothing<br />\nin the constitution prevents the<br />\nbody from acting on noncampus or \"political\" issues.<br />\nAfter the letter presented,<br />\nSenior Class President Paul<br />\nDonio replied, \"Your point is<br />\nwell-taken; we'd like to see<br />\nmore input from students.

According to<br />\nMcGovern, this plan should include the following:<br />\n\u2022The U.S. should forego all<br />\ntesting and development of Star<br />\nWars in return for a mutual 50<br />\npercent reduction in existing<br />\nnuclear weapons while continuing laboratory research.<br />\n\u2022 The U.S. should also accept<br />\nGorbachev's offer of a<br />\nmoratorium on all nuclear<br />\ntesting and then negotiate a<br />\ncomprehensive test ban treaty.<br />\n\u2022 The MX missile should be<br />\ncancelled as \"a contribution to<br />\nbalancing the budget and as a<br />\ntribute to common sense.\"<br />\n\u2022Europe should be designated<br />\na nuclear-free zone which<br />\nmeans that the Western powers<br />\nwould withdraw all their<br />\nmissiles and the Soviets would<br />\nshift their missiles from European targets.<br />\nMcGovern ended his speech<br />\nwith the idea that people<br />\nwould, in the long run, do more<br />\nto produce peace than governments, and that someday<br />\ngovernments had better let the<br />\npeople do just that.<br />\nWarnke began with the statement that this is a \"crucial<br />\npoint in the history of strategic<br />\nnuclear thinking\" and that<br />\nsome people are \"tragically<br />\nmistaken to think that negotiation with the Soviets can't<br />\nwork.\"<br /><br />\nWarnke discussed the different schools of strategic<br />\nnuclear thought. One theory is<br />\nthat Mutually Assured Destruction(MAD)would take place in<br />\na nuclear exchange. Others<br />\nhold a Nuclear Utilization<br />\nTheory Strategy(NUTS)arguing that a nuclear war is<br />\nwinnable.<br />\nUp to this point, Warnke<br />\nsaid, \"the NUTS have been<br />\nahead,\" by chasing \"that will<br />\no' wisp of nuclear superiority.\"<br />\nWarnke also raised the question of what role nuclear<br />\nweapons play in military<br />\nstrategy. Warnke's answer was<br />\nto quote President Reagan's<br />\nState of the Union speech of<br />\nJanuary 1984 by saying that \"A<br />\nnuclear war cannot be won and<br />\nshould not be fought. The only reason to have nuclear<br />\nweapons is to make sure that<br />\nthey can never be used.\"<br />\nThis is a MAD point of view,<br />\n\"embracing\" deterence according to Warnke. Reagan's<br />\nrhetoric may \"stink\" but his<br />\nactions are reasonably sane on<br />\narms control, said Warnke.<br />\n\"The President may be<br />\nMAD, but he's not NUTS,\"<br />\nWarnke concluded from this.<br />\nWarnke then discussed the<br />\n\"rockheaded attitude\" that led<br />\nto the rejection of the SALT II<br />\nabout the<br />\ntreaty and<br />\nunfeasability of the SDI.

But there<br />\nis also another campus radio station in<br />\njeopardy: WA3EPT.<br />\nMost of you have probably never even<br />\nlistened to WA3EPT. For those who<br />\nhaven't, it is the station operated by the<br />\nHopkins Amateur Radio Club. The club<br />\nprovides students interested in ham radio<br />\nwith hands-on experience. They are able<br />\nto contact other radio buffs throughout<br />\nthe country and the world.<br />\nWA3EPT is in jeopardy because the<br />\nclub's current building\u2014the little shack<br />\nnext to the Gatehouse\u2014will soon be torn<br />\ndown to make room for an expansion of<br />\nthe Baltimore Museum of Art. The<br />\nuniversity has agreed to let the museum<br />\nbuild a new sculpture garden in the small<br />\ndell behind the Gatehouse. The deal was<br />\ncontingent upon the fact that this<br />\nnewspaper be allowed to keep its offices<br />\nin the Gatehouse, but the radio club will<br />\napparently be without a home.<br />\nWe realize there is no way to<br />\nreasonably accomodate the radio shack<br />\nwithin the design of the sculpture garden,<br />\nand the club's 30-foot antenna currently located in the dell certainly can't stay.<br />\nOur point is that a greater effort should<br />\ncertainly have been made to find a new<br /><br />\nlocation for the radio club.<br />\nWe know that won't be easy. The club<br />\nrequires an office of some sort to store<br />\nits equipment, and needs to be near an<br />\nopen area so antennae can be erected.<br />\nBut saving an active student group ought<br />\nto be a high priority for the administration (particularly at a school not known<br />\nfor active student groups).<br />\nWhether the university should have offered the land to the museum in the first<br />\nplace is a debatable(and now academic)<br />\nquestion. Admittedly the area is currently ugly, but it is a wonderful location for<br />\nthe radio club. Furthermore, it remains<br />\nto be explained what will be gained by<br />\nallowing the museum to use the area.<br />\n(Other, that is, than pleasing Robert and<br />\nRyda Levi, whose sculpture will be placed in the garden, and who just happen<br />\nto give loads of money to both the school<br />\nand the museum.)<br />\nThere is nothing wrong per se with<br />\nallowing the museum to use the dell. But<br />\nso far there has been little apparent effort to find a new location for the radio<br />\nclub. And there is definitely something<br />\nwrong with disregarding student interests<br />\nbecause somebody in Garland Hall<br />\ndecided to improve relations with the Art<br />\nMuseum.<br /><br />\nTo Boycott...<br />\nOr Not to Boycott<br />\nWhat's going on here?

Rarely does anybody<br />\naround here look past the next orgo test.<br />\nBut while it's certainly a blessing to see<br />\nstudents caring about something other<br />\nthan their studies, it isn't at all clear just<br />\nwhat a boycott of classes today will<br />\naccomplish.<br />\nThe issue of South Africa's institutional racism is, obviously, a complex<br />\nquestion deserving complex consideration. Should American institutions(most<br />\ndefinitely including this university) cease<br />\nto invest in that country? Is the current<br />\ngovernment worse than whatever would<br />\nfollow it, or is it better?(The latter is not<br />\nat all impossible. It was said for many<br />\nyears that there could be nothing worse<br />\nthan the Shah. We have something much<br />\nworse\u2014the Ayatollah.) How will this<br />\ncountry's interests be best served?<br />\nThe problem with a boycott is that it<br />\nwill contribute nothing to a debate of<br />\nthese issues. Instead, it will merely endorse a hopelessly vague assertion: Free<br />\nPrisoners of Apartheid. (The day has<br />\nbeen so designated by, among others, the<br />\nUnited Nations.)<br />\nIf the boycott would actually accomplish something, we might be in<br />\nfavor of it. Apartheid is clearly a barbaric system, and anyone unwilling to<br />\nvoice his moral repugnance to it is either<br />\nblatantly misinformed or blatantly<br />\nstupid. But to merely say you are in favor<br />\nof freedom is to say something so bland<br />\nas to be uninteresting and unimportant.<br /><br />\nPerhaps a worse problem with the<br />\nboycott, however, is that it reflects a<br />\ngreat moral asymmetry. There are literally dozens of countries around the world<br />\nwhich engage in heinous acts, which<br />\npersecute people for their race, their<br />\nreligion, their political beliefs. Are we to<br />\nhave boycotts about them all? Shall we<br />\nhave a day to demand the release of<br />\nprisoners in the Soviet Union? Or Chile?<br />\nOr Cuba? Or North or South Korea? We<br />\ncould probably make it through a whole<br />\nsemester without ever going to a class.<br />\nIt also ought to be noted, however,<br />\nthat a strikingly large number of students<br />\nsimply seem to have missed the point of<br />\nthe boycott. They whine about the<br />\nsacrifice of missing one day of class, apparently unaware of the obscenity of objecting to such an inconvenience when<br />\nseeking to aid people living under tyranny. Can't they see that what happens in<br />\nSouth Africa is slightly more important<br />\nthan getting a good grade in orgo lab?<br />\nNo wonder Hopkins students are known<br />\nfor being the finest examples of pre-med<br />\nsyndrome.<br />\nOur objection to the boycott isn't that<br />\nit's invariably wrong to boycott classes,<br />\nit's that it will do little to better the situation in South Africa, or to further our<br />\nunderstanding of it. Such a protest ought<br />\nto accomplish something. Naively saying<br />\nthat you're in favor of freeing the<br />\nprisoners of apartheid (who isn't?), particularly when you make no mention of<br />\natrocities being committed elsewhere,<br />\ndoesn't do anything constructive.<br /><br />\nFirst, I would like'to clarify<br />\nall misconceptions about the<br />\nevents taking place on Oct. 11,<br />\n1985, which has been<br />\ndesignated \"Free Prisoners of<br />\nApartheid Day.\" Most importantly, it should be noted that<br />\nthe Black Student Union is petitioning, organizing and sponsoring the boycott and educational forums that will take<br />\nplace Oct. 11, 1985. Moreover,<br /><br />\nplanned for the day. Indeed,<br />\nthere are many students (that<br />\nhave to go to class) who will be<br />\nmaking a stand against apartheid by participating in the<br />\neducational forums planned for<br />\nthe day.<br />\nI am grateful that the Student<br />\nCouncil had the courage to take<br />\na stand and come out and support the boycott. It is<br />\ndisheartening to realize that<br /><br />\ndarrell edward cook<br />\nthe boycott of classes is a<br />\nnation-wide event, in which<br />\nmany students of universities<br />\nand colleges across the United<br />\nStates will be participating.<br />\nSecond, there seems to be a<br />\nlot of confusion about the purpose and effectiveness of the<br />\nboycott. The purpose of the<br />\nboycott is simple\u2014it is a means<br />\nof mobilization in order to fight<br />\nthe apathy that exists on this<br />\ncampus and other _ campuses<br />\nabout apartheid. In addition to<br />\nthe boycott, there will be educational forums held which will<br />\nserve as a thought-provoking<br />\nmechanism in order to intensify<br />\nthe awareness about the atrocity that exists in South Africa.<br />\nIn reading last week's NewsLetter, I was shocked to<br />\ndiscover that many students<br />\nseem to`think that if they don't<br />\nboycott their classes, they will<br />\nbe in support of apartheid. Obviously, the student who has an<br />\nexamination or feels he or she<br />\nmust attend their classes should<br />\ndo so. However, this does not<br />\nmean that that particular student cannot support the<br />\nboycott and the other events<br /><br />\nthere are students here who<br />\nbelieve the sole purpose of the<br />\nStudent Council is to improve<br />\nstudent welfare. Now don't get<br />\nme wrong, I agree that the Student Council's main purpose is<br />\nto improve student welfare.<br />\nHowever, that does not mean<br />\nthe Student Council cannot endorse the activities of groups<br />\nhere at Hopkins.<br />\nI applaud the efforts of the<br />\nBlack Student Union and the<br />\nmany students who are participating in the events on Oct.<br />\nII, 1985. It is, indeed, a comfort to know that there are student groups and students here<br />\nat Hopkins who have the<br />\ncourage to stand up for what<br />\nthey believe is right and just. Indeed, by participating in this<br />\nnation-wide event, it is the goal<br />\nof the Black Student Union to<br />\nraise the consciousness of the<br />\nadministration, faculty and<br />\nstudents towards the problems<br />\nthat have existed for blacks in<br />\nSouth Africa for years.<br />\nThe writer is the Executive<br />\nChairperson of the Black Strident Union.<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nEthan Rarick<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nMary Ginder<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nT.J.

According to the Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee on the Status of<br />\nWomen, much should be done.<br />\nAmong the recommendations was a call for the creation<br />\nof four new tenured faculty<br />\npositions created expressly for<br />\nwomen, and a women's study<br />\ncurriculum. Observations in-<br /><br />\nwelfare of women on campus.<br />\nYet, if the university follows all<br />\nthe recommendations of the<br />\ncommittee we risk being unfair<br />\nto some sides in the hope that<br />\nwe can be fair to other sides.<br />\nA major emphasis of the<br />\nreport deals with university<br />\nstaff involved in the academic<br />\naspect of the university. It is<br />\ntrue that women are seriously<br />\nunderrepresented when corn-<br /><br />\njoe chen<br />\neluded in the report maintain<br />\nthe fact that women at this<br />\nuniversity are basically involved in lower level service<br />\npositions which offer little or<br />\nno upward mobility. Thus they<br />\nrecommend revised hiring practices and admissions procedures, among other reforms.<br />\nThe committee further claimed<br />\nthat the university is indifferent<br />\nor hostile to the condition and<br /><br />\npared to their numbers in the<br />\ngeneral population or when<br />\ncompared to national averages<br />\nof women employed in this<br />\narea. This leaves Hopkins as a<br />\npredominantly male institution.<br />\nTo determine the underlying<br />\nreason for this, we must<br />\ndispose of the statistics and<br />\nlook at the causes of<br />\nthis imbalance.<br />\nMost of the blame is due to<br /><br />\ndoes nothing to help us mitigate<br />\nany of the division that surrounds it. Nevertheless, if we<br />\nunderstand the problem of<br />\nSouth Africa as consisting of<br />\nboth a moral and a practical<br />\ndimension, we will do better to<br />\nresolve what actions are appropriate for students, citizens,<br />\nand human beings.<br />\nThe problem of Apartheid is<br />\ncomposed of a practical and<br />\nmoral aspect--and it is the practical aspect which gives us the<br />\nmost trouble. This dimension<br />\nto the issue--the question of<br />\nwhat we as a nation ought to do<br />\nto change conditions in South<br />\nAfrica--is highly problematic. It<br />\nis virtually impossible to accurately predict the exact results<br />\nof any given action taken by a<br />\nnation in the geopolitical realm.<br />\nWe cannot foretell whether<br />\nspecific action taken to alter the<br />\ninternal order of another state<br /><br />\nmay ultimately prove to be<br />\neither effective, undesirable, or<br />\nsimply superfluous. It is over<br />\nthis uncertainty that most of the<br />\ndebate on Apartheid takes<br />\nplace; but the fact that we do<br />\ndebate is good, for perhaps in<br />\nso debating the uncertainty with<br />\nwhich we must contend will be<br />\novercome.<br />\nWhile the problems which<br />\nare posed by the practical issues<br />\nof Apartheid are legion, the<br />\nmoral dimension should be<br />\ncrystal clear. There can be no<br />\ndoubt that Apartheid as a<br />\npolitical and social system is<br />\nreprehensible. Thus, as<br />\nadherents to the notion of inalienable civil liberties, we must<br />\nuniformly oppose the theory<br />\nbehind and practice of any legal<br />\norder which systematically<br />\ndiscriminates against one class<br />\nof citizens in favor of another.<br />\nOn this point our voices must<br /><br />\nthe fact that orderly change<br />\nmust result from an evolutionary, rather than from a<br />\nrevolutionary process. In addition; social intrastructure<br />\nchanges much more slowly than<br />\nthe surface trends which influence it.

That the issue<br />\nis so fraught with complexities<br /><br />\nbe in unison. Of course, the<br />\nspecific actions we should take<br />\nin pursuance of these beliefs is<br />\nsubject to dispute--again, it is a<br />\nmatter for practical consideration.

But these recent<br />\nevents indicate that such glimmers of sensibility are simply<br />\nabberations in an otherwise insensitive approach to student<br />\nrelations. The fact that the administration's inaction regarding the Radio Club is so inexplicable suggest that the gulf<br />\nbetween students and the administration is growing. Their<br />\nmotivations mystify us. This<br /><br />\ngoes beyond simple disagreement. We are at the point where<br />\nthe basic assumptions of one<br />\nside are not disputed by the<br />\nother; they are simply not even<br />\nrecognized. We expect concern<br />\nfor our problems.

In fact,<br />\nthey're rather curious<br />\nand friendly.\"<br /><br />\nEverybody at Hopkins<br />\nknows somebody who has had<br />\nthe opportunity to study<br />\nabroad. Usually they attend<br />\nschool in Italy or England or a<br />\nhost of other nations. But<br />\nDouglas Barnhart was a little<br />\ndifferent\u2014he went to Antarctica.<br />\nBarnhart was one of the six<br />\nScout finalists to be chosen for<br />\nthe journey. He left last<br />\nNovember and returned in<br />\nMay. Approximately four and<br />\na half of these months were<br />\nspent on board ship, a 400-foot<br />\nicebreaker. During the trip,<br />\nBarnhart held the status of<br />\nOfficer-in-Training, which is<br />\nthe equivalent of a senior at the<br />\nCoast Guard or Naval Academies. He learned how to<br />\nnavigate, and served as a<br />\ndelegate to the captain. He also<br />\nparticipated in on-board<br />\noceanographic experiments.<br />\nThe first Antarctic stop was<br />\nat the United States' Palmer<br />\nStation, on the peninsula. Barnnhart observed four species of<br />\nseals and two species of<br />\npenguins there. He said he really enjoyed this brief stop,<br />\nbecause it is the only place these<br />\nanimals exist on the continent.<br />\n\"The penguins aren't at all<br />\nintimidated by humans,\" said<br />\nBarnhart. \"In fact, they're<br />\nrather curious and friendly.\"<br />\nBut apparently penguins give<br />\noff an odor of sulfur that can<br /><br />\nbe detected long before one can<br />\nsee the nesting area.<br />\n\"You could always tell when<br />\nsomeone had been around<br />\npenguins,\" said Barnhart.<br />\nThe next and most important<br />\nstop was at McMurdo station,<br />\nwhere Barnhart would be doing<br />\nhis experiments. McMurdo is<br />\nfarther south along the coast,<br />\nand has about 1000 people<br />\nthere in the summer.(Remember that summer in the<br />\nSouthern Hemisphere is our<br />\nwinter.) Many people are in the<br />\nNavy; the rest are scientists or<br />\ncontracted workers.<br />\nThe main biology and<br />\ngeology labs are located at<br />\nMcMurdo, so a lot of research<br />\ngoes on there. Barnhart worked in a biochemistry lab, experimenting with anti-freeze<br />\nproteins in fish. His work had<br />\nan unusual twist to it\u2014he actually caught the fish himself<br />\nand prepared them for experimentation. Barnhart did<br />\nnot mind this at all because it<br />\nwas \"an opportunity to take<br />\nout the snowmobile.\"<br />\nBarnhart spent four days at<br />\nthe U.S. South Pole Station.<br />\nThe only work that can go on<br />\nthere is weather research, and<br />\nBarnhart suspected that the<br />\nreasons the U.S. has chosen to<br />\nmaintain a base there are more<br />\npolitical that scientific.

To<br />\nLucas, a freelance designer and<br />\nentrepeneur, jewelry is a<br />\nserious, and growing, business.<br />\n\"It all started in a crafts class<br />\nwhich I took in 9th grade,\" said<br />\nLucas. \"I decided I enjoyed<br />\nmaking things with my hands,<br />\nand I began to think about<br />\ndesigns for different things<br />\nwhich I could make. Eventually, I began to put some designs<br />\nwhich I had in my head, mostly for things like belt buckles,<br />\nonto paper. From there, all I<br /><br />\nhad to do was make them.\"<br />\nAlthough he enjoyed fashioning things in his crafts class, it<br />\nwasn't until later that his interest became a business. The<br />\nstory of Lucas'jewelry business<br />\nis in a sense the quintessential<br />\ncapitalist epic, the traditional<br />\njustification for free enterprise.<br />\n\"My older sister is a fashion<br />\ncommentator in New York. She<br />\nalways liked buying elaborate<br />\njewelry, and one day she came<br />\nhome with a pair of earrings<br />\nwhich cost her some crazy<br />\namount of money. I told her<br />\nshe was wasting her money,<br />\nthat I could make a pair just as<br />\ngood for a lot less. Well, inade<br />\nher a pair of earrings, and a few<br />\nof her friends asked her where<br />\nshe got them. They asked for a<br />\nfew pairs, then they told a few<br />\nfriends, and after a while it<br />\nbegan to take up a lot of my<br />\ntime. That's when I decided to<br />\nget organized.\"<br />\nAs good as Lucas is as a<br />\ndesigner, it is his organizational<br />\nskills which turned the hobby<br />\ninto a business. An uncle who<br />\nis a successful commercial artist<br />\ntaught him the importance of<br /><br />\nresearch and persistence, and<br />\nLucas decided it was time to<br />\nmove into the fine jewelry<br />\nmarket. He grew up in Bloomfield, New Jersey, not far from<br />\nNew York, and it was to New<br />\nYork that he had to go. The<br />\ncenter of the industry is on 47th<br />\nstreet in Manhattan, and Lucas<br />\nbegan making trips there to buy<br />\nthe gold, silver, and brass which<br />\nwould go into his creations.<br />\n\"When I started to put<br />\ntogether a portfolio, it became<br />\nimportant to have a sense of<br />\nwhat people would be wearing<br />\nduring a particular season. I<br />\nstarted to read a lot of high<br />\nfashion magazines, from which<br />\nI would get a general concept,<br />\nor a 'look'. Then I'd just think<br />\nof what would go with it, I'd<br />\ndraw it, and I'd make it.\"<br />\nAfter a while, he'd made a<br />\nvaried assortment of pieces,<br />\nranging from bracelets to cufflinks and ear clips. While a<br />\nstudent at the University of<br />\nMiami, he met a designer who<br />\nbegan to use some of his belts.<br />\nNot long afterwards, he began<br />\nmarketing in earnest.<br />\n\"Because I'm a freelance<br /><br />\ndesigner, I have to take the first<br />\nstep in getting my stuff into a<br />\nstore. When I see a store which<br />\nI thing will do a good job of<br />\nselling, and which will sell the<br />\njewelry at the price it's worth,<br />\nI call and set up an appointment to have the buyer looker<br />\neverything over. Then, if they<br />\nlike it, they'll place an order<br />\nfor, say, a dozen pairs of earrings and a few of everything<br />\nelse.\"<br />\nPart of Lucas' marketing<br />\nstrategy is to associate his name<br />\nwith his product. Everything he<br />\nmakes bears his discreet initials,<br />\nand all store displays group his<br />\nwork together as a special collection. He also keeps varying<br />\nhis designs, and never produces<br />\nmore than a few of each particular piece. Each piece is consequently more distinctive, and<br />\nLucas' work remains that of an<br />\nartist and not someone with a<br />\nfew designs trying to make a lot<br />\nof money fast.<br />\nLucas transferred to Hopkins<br />\nthis fall, after two and a half<br />\nyears at Miami. Although he<br />\nhad begun to sell his work in<br />\nsevLral fine jewelry stores in<br /><br />\nFlorida, his plans called for a<br />\nchange in location. Baltimore<br />\nmade sense for a variety of<br />\nreasons. \"When I was at<br />\nMiami, I kept having to fly to<br />\nNew York to get materials.<br />\nBaltimore/Washington is closer<br />\nto New York, and it's got a<br />\nmore accessible jewelry market<br />\nthan Miami.

While it<br />\nwas the U.S. icebreaker that actually went out, the same<br />\nBritish ship was preparing to go<br />\nout as well. Interesting, considering that those two nations<br />\nwere at war not too far away.<br />\nEverybody expects Antarctica to be extremely cold. While<br />\nBarnhart experienced lows of<br />\nabout -10\u00b0 F, and it was not uncommon to have vicious 40-50<br />\nknot winds, it was sometimes as<br /><br />\nwarm as 32\u00b0 F, and the reflection of the sun on the snow<br />\noften made it comfortable<br />\nenough to work outdoors in<br />\nshirtsleeves, Barnhart said.<br />\nOne of the more unusual<br />\naspects of Barnhart's trip was<br />\nthat the sun never set for two<br />\nand a half months. He really<br />\nhad to learn to go by his<br />\nwatch\u2014he said that it was very<br />\ndifficult to sleep when there was<br />\nno darkness at all.<br />\nBarnhart said he spent most<br />\nof the free time he had exploring the land. However, he said<br />\nthat many of the people there<br />\nrelax with videotapes of<br />\nmovies, since there is no T.V.<br />\n\"It helps you keep your sanity,\" Barnhart said, \"because<br />\nyou can be overcome with a<br />\nfeeling of isolation.\"<br />\nBarnhart tried calling home<br />\nvia radio. Sometimes this worked well, and other times it was<br />\ncompletely unintelligible. He<br />\ndid recieve mail, but it took<br />\nseveral weeks to get there. He<br />\nalso felt very out of touch with<br />\nworld events. Barnhart said<br />\nthat this long period of being<br />\ncut off from home was the only drawback. Holidays were the<br />\ntoughest; Christmas Day was<br />\nspent setting sail from Chile.<br />\nBarnhart said he hopes to<br />\nreturn some day to Antarctica,<br />\nbut for a shorter period of time.<br />\nEven though he plans to attend<br />\nmedical school, he sees the<br />\nreturn as realistic; while in Antarctica he met up with a recent<br />\nmed school graduate who was<br />\ntaking some time off to do<br />\nresearch down there.

The production is the<br />\nbest Marshall has ever gotten,<br />\ndefinitely, but makes him<br />\nsound just like any number of<br />\n\"roots\" bands currently clogging up the air at WHFS. This<br />\nrecord sits Marshall right along<br />\nside bands like the Blasters, Del<br />\nFuegos, Jason and the Scorchers, and of course T-Bone<br />\nhimself.

On<br />\nthe one hand, there is no doubt<br />\nthat \"In Between Days\" is a<br />\nrip-off kind of a song. On the<br />\nother hand, the album and<br />\nsingle are pure Cure all the way<br />\nthrough\u2014ripping off everyone<br />\npossible including themselves.<br />\nThe result is a mish-mash of<br />\ncontemporary electro-pop. It's<br />\na progression from their last<br />\nalbum, The Top, but largely in<br />\nthe same style\u2014densely produced pop with a definite current of gloom running<br />\nthroughout.

In the delightful<br />\ndescending figures of the A<br />\nminor sonata, Horszowski<br />\ncommunicated the true warmth<br />\nof these works which Scarlatti<br />\nentitled \"essercizi\" (literally<br />\ntranslated exercizes or etudes.)<br />\nHorszowski further established<br /><br />\nthe brilliance and color of these<br />\nshort pieces with his performances of the Sonata No. 20<br />\nclearly<br />\nhe<br />\nwherein<br />\nthese<br />\nthat<br />\nted<br />\ndemonstra<br />\nspirited, gay pieces were<br />\ndecidedly not the objects of a<br />\nschoolboy's drudgery.<br />\nNext on the program was<br />\nMozart's Fantasy in D major,<br />\nK.397, a work of tempermental moods that the composer,<br />\nthrough the license of the fantasy form, purposely kept from<br />\nattaining a definite cadential<br />\nresolution. Horszowski handled the delicate, lyrical \"arietta\"<br />\nthat begins the piece with the<br />\nutmost care, while playing the<br />\nintruding ominous and dirgeful<br />\nmeasures that break up this airy<br />\nmelody with equally convincing<br />\nlamentation. The inconstant<br /><br />\nmood of the Fantasy gives the<br />\npiece the capricious character<br />\nthat is typical of Mozart's<br />\nworks. This the pianist<br />\nacknowledged, but to his credit<br />\ndid not embellish.<br />\nThe last piece before the intermission was Mozart's Sonata<br />\nin D major, K.576, in three<br />\nmovements\u2014Allegro, Adagio,<br />\nand Allegretto. In the Allegro,<br />\nHorszowski demonstrated<br />\nMozart's true genius with his<br />\nbright crisp execution of the<br />\ndizzying upper voice while<br />\nmaintaining the grace and flow<br />\nof the smooth arpeggios in the<br />\naccompaniment. The pianist<br />\naccomplished the expressive<br />\nbeginning of the Adagio with<br />\nfull feeling and gave the occasional minor-key sentiments of<br />\nthe treble due consideration<br /><br />\nbefore striking a cheerful<br />\nbalance between the two<br />\ntoward the end of the movement. The Alegretto was announced with a pretentious<br />\nmelody concordant with<br />\nMozart's wit, in the playing of<br />\nwhich Horszowski neither<br />\npatronized Mozart nor the audience, while the melody an<br />\nhonest, but still delightful<br />\ninterpretation.<br />\nHorszowski opened the second half of the program with<br />\nBeethoven's Fifteen Variations<br />\nand Fugue in E-flat minor, Op.<br />\n35, subtitled \"Eroica.\" This<br />\npiece turned out to be the<br />\nhighlight of the evening.

Then, with<br />\ndeftness of execution, he<br />\nbrought forth with bright spontaneity the full-fledged melody<br />\nof the piece.<br />\nHorszowski displayed his<br />\nmastery at the piano in playing<br />\nthe variations with their widely<br />\nvarying character and moods of<br />\nmultifarious drama and intrigue. The first variation, an<br />\nintricate reworking of the main<br />\ntheme, Horszowski skillfully<br />\ndispatched. Following this,<br />\nHorszowski explored variations<br />\nwhich employed long arpeggios<br />\nin both registers; arpeggios in<br />\nthe accompaniment with<br />\ndelicate staccato counterpoint<br />\nin the upper registers, and<br />\nsmooth lyric melodies of expository nature, all of which<br />\nthoroughly enchanted the<br />\nShriver Hall audience.<br />\nHorszowski played the more<br />\nmirthful sections of the piece<br />\nwith humor and lightheartedness, but rose to the<br />\ntechnically difficult later variations with true virtuosity. He<br />\ngrandly rounded out the work<br />\nwith a spirited attack of the<br />\nfull-bodied final measures and<br />\nsignificantly<br />\nit<br />\nclosed<br />\nbass<br />\nmeaningful<br />\nwith the<br />\nrumbling with which it began.<br />\nThe two final pieces on the<br />\nprogram were the Polanaise in<br />\nC minor, Op. 40, No. 2, and<br />\nthe Bolero in C major, Op. 19,<br /><br />\nof Chopin. The second<br />\nPolanaise of Op. 40 embodies<br />\na melody of blackness and morbidity, feelings which pervade<br />\nmany of Chopin's works contemporary with this one.<br />\nHorszowski gave much grave<br />\nconsideration to the dark<br />\nmelody which opens the piece<br />\nand played with antipodal radiance the colorful, happy<br />\nmelody which temporarily<br />\ngains the Polonaise after many<br />\nspirited musical battles with the<br />\nfirst theme. However, after a<br />\nfinal pitched battle of Olympian dimension in which<br />\nHorszowski capably portrayed<br />\nthe essence of the contest between good and evil through<br />\nmetaphor, the<br />\nmelodic<br />\nPolonaise ends with the cryptic<br />\nmelody once more dominating.<br />\nThe enthusiasm of the<br />\nShriver Hall audience enjoined<br />\nMr. Horszowski to play an encore, and he gladly obliged with<br />\nNiendelssohn's Spring Songs<br />\nand Chopin's Op. 15, No. 2,<br />\nshowing no fatigue in their<br />\nperformance.<br />\nHis program free from ostentation and pretentiousness, Mr.<br />\nHorszowski affirmed that his<br />\ntrue virtuosity lies in his unfeigned, yet sagacious, performing<br />\nstyle.<br />\nIf Sunday evening's performance was any reflection at all<br />\nupon Mr. Horszowski's eightyseven years as a professional<br />\npianist, the world has been truly<br />\nblessed with the simple honesty of this greatly accomplished<br />\nmusician.<br /><br />\nMANAGE YOUR CAREER<br />\nWITH A<br />\nROC Pi<br /><br />\nTERM \u2022IEL<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nt the University of Rochester's Graduate School<br />\nof Management you can manage your career with a highly<br />\nrespected M.B.A. With our wide variety of financial aid and loan<br />\nprograms, you can manage your finances, too.

Trudeau, Holt,<br />\nRinehart &amp; Winston, $5.95<br />\nby Amitava 7 Biswas A.O.<br />\nThere are only three major<br />\nvehicles to keep us informed<br />\nas to what is going on in<br />\nWashington: the electronic<br />\nmedia, the print media, and<br />\nDoonesbury, not necessarily<br />\nin that order.<br />\n\u2014President Gerald Ford<br />\nWell, that's not saying much<br />\nfor President Ford, or for the<br />\nfolks down in Washington, but<br />\nit does point out the significance<br />\nthat Doonesbury has had in<br />\nsociety. Pulitzer prize winner<br />\nGarry Trudeau has now come<br />\nout with the latest compilation<br />\nof his comic strip series, Check<br />\nYour Egos at the Door.<br />\nThe title is, as everyone<br />\nknows by now, a reference to<br />\nthe much publicized \"We Are<br />\nthe World\" recording sessions,<br />\nand it drew some criticism from<br />\nthose interpreting the reference<br />\nas a rather cynical attack on a<br />\ntruly humanitarian, philanthropic gesture. Lately,<br />\nDoonesbury has come under<br />\nsome more such criticism, from<br />\nthe people Trudeau chooses to<br />\nsatirize, but then, that's only<br />\nnatural when one chooses sides<br />\non controversial issues.<br /><br />\nEgos finds Mike Doonesbury<br />\nand wife J.J. still living at<br />\nWalden, and still very youngurban-professional. Zonker is<br />\nseen entering Duke's Baby Doc<br />\nMedical School in Jamaica,<br />\nwhere Honey is now Dean<br />\nHoney(\"Welcome to Club PreMed\", she tells Zonker upon<br />\narrival, so now you know how<br />\noriginal the Black and Blue Jay<br />\nis).

But they said it was<br />\nmarijuana\" Hedley Jr.<br />\nThrough him, Trudeau examines such pressing questions<br />\nas what exactly should be done<br />\nwith Vice President Bush's<br />\nmanhood and Senator Garn's<br />\nSpace Shuttle junket as a vomit<br /><br />\nspecialist. Of course, everyone<br />\nelse's lives are also very much<br />\ntied in to the current social<br />\nscene, as when \"Subway Hero\"<br />\nMike has to cope with media<br />\nexaggeration, and Jimmy<br />\nThudpucker is called upon to<br />\nlend his voice to the \"We Are<br />\nthe World\" sessions (specifically for the `the').<br />\nWhich brings us back to the<br />\nquestions of cynicism, humor,<br />\ncontroversy, and bias. Sure,<br />\nTrudeau is biased (\"a whining<br />\nliberal bleeding heart,\" says<br />\none critic). Sure, if your views<br />\ndiffer, you will be annoyed.<br />\nGeorge Bush was rather perturbed at Trudeau's contention<br />\nthat manhood wouldn't draw<br />\nmuch interest since there wasn't<br />\nmuch capital to begin with<br />\nanyway. But give Trudeau a<br />\nbreak, he went to Yale. Had he<br />\ngotten a real education, he<br />\nmight have been more substantive. Blame it on the system.<br />\nPersonally, I think comics<br />\nshould be funny, whether they<br />\nbe about the deficit or the Sopwith Camel. As a comic strip<br />\nartist, Trudeau should be judged by his humor value, not by<br />\nhis thorough examination of all<br />\nthe facts, or how well he<br />\npresents an argument. No one,<br />\nwith the possible exception of<br />\nGerald Ford and his cabinet<br />\nreads the comic section for<br />\npolitical commentary, as no<br /><br />\nCheck Your<br />\nEgos at the Door<br /><br />\none reads Foreign Affairs for a<br />\nlaugh. In this respect, I must<br />\nsay that I found Egos to be funny. I laughed, my roommates<br />\nlaughed, you'll probably laugh.<br />\nIf you don't, you lose. $5.95 to<br />\nbe exact. If you buy it to gain<br />\nserious insight into politics,<br />\nyou're in pretty sad shape.<br /><br />\nLikewise, if you take offense.<br />\nOh yes, and even if you do<br />\nlose the $5.95, be content with<br />\nthe knowledge that Trudeau<br />\nhas agreed to donate all proceeds to USA for Africe. After<br />\nall, he is a bleeding-heart<br />\nliberal, right?<br /><br />\nThe Sailor Who Fellfrom Grace with the Sea<br />\nby Eileen de la Cruz<br />\nMishima: A Biography. by<br />\nJohn Nathan, Little Brown and<br />\nCompany, $8.95. 300 pages.<br /><br />\nFor most of us, there is no<br />\nreason or time between<br />\nalcoholism, classes and being<br />\nyoung to think of death. When<br />\nthe thought does occur, it is a<br /><br />\nRzTit144/<br />\nJOHN NATHAN<br /><br />\njoke, a silly abstract, a \"slay\"<br />\non words\u2014we've all died of<br />\nembarrassment, been killed by<br />\ntests, murdered by our<br />\nroommates\u2014but in three<br />\nseconds we are resurrected an<br />\ngo on in our immortal fashion.<br />\nTo re,ad John Nathan's<br />\nMishima: A Biography from<br />\nthis youthful perspective is a<br />\ndisorienting and eerie experience. Drawing from<br />\nMishima's diaries and letters,<br />\ninterviews with family and<br />\nfriends, and his own personal<br />\nexperience as Mishima's<br />\ntranslator(The Sailor who Fell<br />\nfrom Grace with the Sea) and<br />\nas his friend, Nathan has produced a morbidly fascinating<br />\naccount of the Japanese<br />\nwriter's lifelong obsession with<br />\ndeath. Published in 1974, the<br />\nbook has been re-released to<br />\ncoincide with the opening of the<br />\nmovie Mishima by Paul<br />\n(American Gigilo,Taxi Driver)<br />\nSchrader.<br />\nYukio Mishima, Japan's<br />\nmost prominent postwar<br />\nnovelist, was born in Tokyo on<br />\nJanuary 14, 1925, and raised<br />\nuntil age twelve by his insane<br />\ngrandmother. During what<br />\nNathan depicts as a subnormal<br />\nchildhood, he cultivated a penchant for \"beauty, blood and<br />\ndeath\" and developed a passion<br />\nfor writing. At school<br />\nMishima's subtly perverse fiction and poetry drew an admiring audience, and by sixteen he<br />\nhad already been published in<br />\na magazine. The advent of<br />\nWorld War 11 heightened his<br /><br />\ndesire for a \"beautiful death,\"<br />\nbut he escaped the draft, being<br />\ndeclared physically unfit for duty. Mishima graduated with a<br />\nlaw degree from the Imperial<br />\nUniversity in 1947 and soon absorbed himself completely in his<br />\nwriting and his nihilistic fantasies. A three time contender<br />\nfor the Nobel Prize, Mishima<br />\nwas an extremely prolific and<br />\nversatile writer. He produced<br />\nforty novels, eighteen plays,<br />\ntwenty volumes of short stories<br />\nand essays, and more than a<br />\nhundred romantice hack novels<br />\nfor housewife consumption. By<br />\nthe mid-1950's, he was a national celebrity and flamboyant<br />\npublic figure. Like a displaced<br />\nAmerican rocker, he sported<br />\nHawaiian shirts, black pegged<br />\npants, sunglasses and a crew<br />\ncut. He was open about his<br />\nhomosexuality, but wed in<br />\n1958. He lifted weights<br />\nreligiously and starred in a<br />\ngangster movie. In the 1960's<br />\nMishima began to evolve a<br />\n\"patriotism\" that would provide him with the means and<br />\nfaith to achieve \"the rapture of<br />\ndeath,\" which he had sought<br />\nbefore all during his life in his<br />\nfantasies and his writing. Determined to became a man of action, he enlisted in Japan's Self<br />\nDefense Force in 1969 and soon<br />\nafter formed his \"Shield Society\" to protect the emperor.

Docter Stanley E. Order,<br />\nprofessor of radiation oncology<br />\nat The Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, recently announced<br />\nthat radiolabelled antibodies<br />\nhave caused significant remissions in patients with liver<br />\ncancer and Hodgkin's Disease.<br />\nThe fact that this treatment,<br />\nunlike chemotherapy or<br />\nsurgery, is almost symptomfree, makes this one of the most<br />\nexciting medical discoveries of<br />\nour time.<br />\nThe success of this treatment<br />\nrelies on the ability of these antibodies to distinguish cancer<br /><br />\ncells from normal tissue. Antibodies are molecules of the<br />\nimmune system that work by<br />\nrecognizing proteins called antigens on the surface of foreign<br />\ncells. When it encounters an antigen that is not native to the<br />\norganism, the antibody signals<br />\nother cells in the immune<br />\nsystem to enter and destroy the<br />\ninvading cells.<br />\nAntigens in an organism change<br />\nas a fertilized ovum divides,<br />\nand grows into a fetus. As<br />\nbillions of cells divide daily,<br />\nthey become organized through<br />\nbiochemical signals unique to<br />\neach organ. This process is called differentiation.

Two of these tumorrelated antigens are alpha-feto<br />\nprotein and ferritin.<br />\nWhile Dr. Order was studying at Harvard, he discovered<br />\na large concentration of ferritin<br />\nin the spleens of patients with<br />\nHodgkin's Disease.

Some<br />\nforms of leprosy produce<br />\nserious immune system<br />\nreactions.<br />\nAlthough the Hopkins<br />\nresearchers do not yet know the<br />\nprecise way thalidomide works<br />\nto suppress or damp down immune reactions, they suspect<br />\nthe drug afffects the activity of<br />\na special group of white blood<br />\ncells, called T4 helper cells, that<br />\nnormally bolster the immune<br />\nsystem's response to \"foreign\"<br />\ncells.<br />\nEuropean pharmoceutical<br />\ncompanies tested thalidomide<br />\nfor its sedative effects in<br />\nlaboratory rats during the<br />\n1950's, and found no evidence<br />\nthat it caused birth defects.<br />\nThe drug became available<br />\nwithout prescription in West<br />\nGermany in 1958, and was<br />\navailable by prescription in<br />\nCanada, Great Britain, Portugal, Australia, and New<br />\nZealand. A cautious Food and<br />\nDrug Administration kept the<br />\ndrug off the market in the U.S.<br />\nPhysicians soon began to see<br />\nincreased incidence of an<br />\nunusual<br />\nbirth<br />\ndefect\u2014<br />\nphocomelia\u2014a shortening or<br />\nelimination of the long bones of<br />\nthe arms and, in some cases, the<br />\nlegs, resulting in flipperlike<br /><br />\nlimbs.<br />\nBefore its 1962 withdrawal<br />\nfrom the world market,<br />\nthalidomide was estimated to<br />\nbe involved in up to 6,000<br />\ndefective births.<br />\nThe drug's immunosuppressive action was discovered<br />\nin 1965 when it was administered as a sedative to patients in Israel with a severe<br />\nsystemic form of leprosy. The<br />\nphysician noted that the<br />\ndisease's skin sores waned after<br />\nonly a few days of thalidomide<br />\ntreatment, and effect which<br />\nusually took months to accomplish using other drugs.<br />\nIn 1980, Hopkins inthat<br />\nvestigators<br />\nfound<br />\nthalidomide is converted in the<br />\nbody to a chemical derivative,<br />\ncalled an arene matabolite,<br />\nwhich causes damage to<br />\ndeveloping embryos. Conversion of thalidomide occurs in<br />\nthe liver tissue of humans,<br />\nmonkeys and rabbits, but not in<br />\nrats, the only species tested for<br />\nthese effects during the drug's<br />\npremarketing tests.<br />\nIn the Hopkins study, 17 of<br />\n22 rats pretreated with<br />\nthalidomide did not develop<br />\nGVHD, reports Vogelsgang.<br />\nConfirmed on Page 23<br /><br />\nconcentration in the cancer<br />\ntissue, if an antibody to ferritin<br />\ncould be made, it would attack<br />\nonly the cancer tissue, and not<br />\nthe normal tissue. This was accompolished by injecting rabbits with ferritin, so that their<br />\nimmune system would produce<br />\nantibodies to it. By labelling<br />\nthis antiferrin antibody with<br />\nradioactive iodine, it was shown<br />\nthat it bound primarily to the<br />\ntumor cells, and not to normal<br />\ntissue. This factor is part of<br /><br />\nwhat Dr. Order terms the<br />\n\"biologic window;\" the properties of tumors which cause<br />\nthe antiferritin antibody to bind<br />\nthere, despite the fact that normal tissue also contains ferritin.<br />\nOther factors of this \"window\"<br />\nare the new vasculature in<br />\ntumors, which lack smooth<br />\nmuscle, and the slower blood<br />\nflow.

It was a winable<br />\ngame, agrees the majority of<br />\nthe team. If someone would<br />\nhave told Coach Jerry Pfeifer<br />\nthat his defense would surrender only one touchdown, he<br />\nwould have assumed a victory.<br />\nGranted offensively the squad<br />\ndoes not have it all together yet,<br />\nand granted, Mark Campbell<br />\nhas yet to prove his potential;<br />\nbut with Brad McLam back for<br />\nhis first game and Tom Finegan<br />\ncatching close to ten passes a<br />\ngame, the Jays could definitely<br />\nscore some points...well, probably score points. . .okay,<br />\nmaybe not.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS DEFENSIVE STATS<br /><br />\nTackles<br /><br />\nArtfitch<br />\nHirshman<br />\nByrd<br />\nRyan<br />\nKalup<br />\nKwiatkowski<br />\nParadakis<br />\nLansinger<br />\nCardwell<br />\nSchell<br />\nTully<br />\nShalley<br /><br />\nSolo<br />\n14<br />\n10<br />\n10<br />\n10<br />\n9<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n3<br />\n1<br />\n2<br /><br />\nAssisted<br />\n39<br />\n30<br />\n29<br />\n25<br />\n21<br />\n23<br />\n22<br />\n15<br />\n9<br />\n12<br />\n11<br />\n9<br /><br />\nTotal<br />\n53<br />\n40<br />\n39<br />\n35<br />\n30<br />\n25<br />\n23<br />\n21<br />\n15<br />\n15<br />\n12<br />\n11<br /><br />\nAssisted<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n0<br /><br />\nTotal<br />\n5<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br /><br />\nSacks<br /><br />\nByrd<br />\nParadak is<br />\nKalup<br />\nSchell<br />\nRyan<br />\nTully<br />\nThomas<br />\nKwiatkowski<br />\nSokolowski<br />\nArtfitch<br /><br />\nSolo<br />\n4<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n1<br /><br />\nByrd<br />\nHirshman<br />\nRyan<br />\nTully<br />\nKwiatkowski<br />\nRayner<br /><br />\nRecovered<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n1<br /><br />\nInterceptions<br /><br />\nHirshowan<br />\nSchell<br />\nCardwell<br />\nArtfitcb<br /><br />\nNumber<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n1<br /><br />\nTotal Yds.<br />\n49<br />\n22<br />\n26<br />\n0<br /><br />\nJess Bunshaft<br /><br />\nFor the Cridders to be sucessful on Saturday, captains Mark Campbell<br />\nand Brad McLam will have to pick up a quiet offensive attack. McLam<br />\nis now within 100 yards of becoming JHU's all-time leading rusher.<br /><br />\nfield, Gettysburg took over<br />\npossession and drove 53 yards<br />\non eight plays. The big play was<br />\nan off tackle counter that went<br />\n30 yards to the 18 yard line.<br />\nFour different Blue Jays missed tackles on the play. Three<br />\nplays later, the Bullets led 7-0.<br />\nEarly in the third quarter,<br />\nHopkins handed Gettysburg<br />\nanother score. After trading<br />\npunts, Hopkins took over<br />\npossession on its own one yard<br />\nline. After moving the ball three<br />\nyards on two plays, the Jays<br />\nhad third down and seven from<br />\nthe four yard line. Then came<br />\nan option left. It seemed as if<br />\nCoach Pfeifer has his finger<br />\nstuck on the option button...and this one cost him.<br />\nCampbell was hit trying to<br />\npitch the ball and the fumble<br />\nwas recovered by Gettysburg in<br />\nthe end zone, 13-0.<br />\nThe defense showed a little<br />\npride late in the third quarter<br /><br />\nwhen Gettyburg threatened to<br />\nmake the game a blowout.<br />\nWith a fourth down from the<br />\nthree yard line, Gettysburg<br />\nwent off tackle left but the<br />\ndefense stopped them on the<br />\none.<br />\nPfeifer used the 'hook and<br />\nladder' to get the offense out of<br />\nits own end and create a spark<br />\nfor the squad. Campbell hit<br />\nFinegan on a curl pattern who<br />\nlateraled to McLam who was<br />\nbrought down at the Hopkins<br />\n37 yard line. But the spark died<br />\nand the teams traded punts for<br />\nthe entire fourth quarter and<br />\nthe game ended 13-0.<br />\nSo now the Jays have Ursinus tomorrow on the turf at<br />\n1:30. Maybe this will be that<br />\ngame when the offense explodes. The odds are that it will<br />\nbe. Campbell is due. The offensive line is due. The receiving<br />\ncorps is due. The defense?

However, the unit<br />\nknows it is better than what it<br />\nhas shown. It seems as if<br />\neveryone on the team is waiting<br />\nfor the game when it all comes<br />\ntogether.<br />\n\"I know we haven't played<br />\nup to our potential,\" said offensive tackle Jim Davis. \"We<br />\nare having problems with consistency. One lineman will have<br />\na good game but another will<br />\nhave a bad one.\"<br />\nDefensively, the Jays had a<br />\ntough time with the Gettysburg<br />\nrunning attack, surrendering<br />\n292 yards of the ground. But<br />\nthat was a given before the<br />\ngame. The forte of the squad is<br />\npass defense. The Jays were<br />\nnumber one in pass defense last<br />\nseason and well on the way to<br />\nrepeating. Stopping the Gettysburg running game was going to be tough. The defense<br />\ndid give up yardage but when it<br />\ncame time to toe the line, the<br />\nJays held it.<br />\n\"They were by far the<br />\nstrongest offensive team we've<br />\nfaced but they were predictable,\" said cornerback Jim<br />\nCardwell. \"It was some bending but we didn't break.\"<br />\nGettysburg's first touchdown<br />\ncame with only 45 seconds remaining in the first half.

Although outshot 15-12, the team held strong<br />\non defense and thwarted a potent Badger attack. Freshman<br />\nsweeper Matt Lawrence played<br />\na particularly strong game,<br />\nmaking numerous clears in<br />\ncritical situations. Sophomore<br /><br />\nGrenville Jones turned in a<br />\nsolid effort, using his playmaking skills to coordinate a persistent attack and keep pressure<br />\noff the defensive corps.

Lee<br />\nThis past Saturday, the lady<br />\nHarriers attended the George<br />\nMason Invitational Cross<br />\nCountry Meet. This large invitational showcased the team's<br />\nbest performance of the year.<br />\nWhat makes this feat so impressive were the unforeseen<br />\ndisturbances the Jays had to endure before getting to the race.<br />\nThe first inconvenience faced by the team dealt with the<br />\nmode of transportation. At the<br />\nlocal car rental for the team's<br />\nreserved van, coach Eleanor<br />\nSimonsick was told \"No can<br />\ndo\" by Mr. Rent-A-Car. Instead of the van, a station<br />\nwagon took a portion of the<br />\nsquad while the remaining went<br />\nwith coach Gary Green.<br />\nTravelling in overcrowded<br />\ncars, the team was making good<br />\ntime as they headed for the<br />\nmeet. Unfortunately, the god of<br />\ntransportation was not on their<br /><br />\nside. About five miles from<br />\nGeorge Mason University,<br />\ndisaster struck. One of the lady<br />\nJays suffered from nausea and<br />\nits unwelcome outcome. Abandoning the rented station<br />\nwagon on the side of the road,<br />\nthe Jays were shuttled to the<br />\nmeet in the remaining car.<br />\nDue to the unexpected circumstances, the squad arrived<br />\nonly minutes before the start of<br />\nthe race. Unfamiliar with the<br />\ncourse and not fully warmedup, the Jays ran the race with<br />\nguts.<br />\nRunning hard and fast,<br />\nMaureen Shea recorded the best<br />\ntime for the Jays, running the<br />\n3-mile course in 18:33. Following Shea by 11 seconds was a<br />\nnew and imprproved Cecilia<br />\nKing. After King were Suzi<br />\nMcGinn in 19:30, Anita Kim in<br />\n19:44, and Tami Oki in 20:19.<br />\nRounding out the Magnificent<br />\nSeven were Sindee Gozansky in<br />\n20:03 and Karen Grissmer in<br /><br />\nKennedy To Lead Jays<br />\nby Adam Warner<br />\nThe Hopkins swim team will<br />\nrace into a new direction in the<br />\n'85-'86 season as George Kennedy, Jr., replaces Tim Welsh<br />\nas coach of both the men's and<br />\nwomen's teams.<br />\nThe 30-year-old Kennedy<br />\ncomes to JHU from Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference rival Gettysburg College, where he<br />\nserved for five years as head<br />\ncoach and turned a mediocre<br />\nprogram into a Division III<br />\nforce. His women's teams won<br />\nfour MAC championships during his tenure, while his men's<br />\nsquads finished second to<br />\nHopkins each season. Kennedy<br />\ncompiled an overall dual meet<br />\nprorecord of 79-29-1, and<br />\nduced 24 MAC Individual<br />\nchampions, 20 NCAA AllAmericans, and 41 National<br />\nQualifiers.<br />\nAccording to Athletic Direc-<br /><br />\ntor Bob Scott, \"We were extremely pleased to get a coach<br />\nof George Kennedy's talent and<br />\nability to come to Hopkins and<br />\ngive us the direction towards<br />\ncompeting for the Division III<br />\nnational championship.\"<br />\n\"Not only is he an outstanding coach, but he is an excellent recruiter as well,\" Scott<br />\nadds.<br />\nIn assuming the Blue Jay<br />\nhelm, Kennedy will attempt to<br />\nfill some pretty big shoes,<br />\nnamely those of his two immediate predecessors here at<br />\nHopkins. Frank Comfort took<br />\nover the team in 1969 and, according to Scott, \"moved our<br />\nprogram into a national<br />\npower.\" His team won the<br />\nNCAA championship in 1977.<br />\nComfort then left Hopkins<br />\nfor the University of North<br />\nCarolina. He was replaced by<br />\nContinued on Page 26<br /><br />\n21:24.<br />\nNoticeably missing from the<br />\nrace was freshman sensation<br />\nMolly Bardsley, who was injured with a sprained ankle.<br />\nRegardless, this meet showed<br />\nmarked improvements by King<br />\nand senior Tami Oki, who<br />\nlowered her early season pace<br />\nfrom 7:05 minutes per mile to<br />\n6:46 minutes per mile. The<br />\nMason meet also enabled the<br />\nJays to prove themselves after<br />\ntheir disappointing dual meet<br />\nagainst Gettysburg. The Gettysburg meet was a tough loss<br />\nfor the Jays as it was their first<br />\ndual<br />\nmeet<br />\ndefeat.<br />\nArriving at the historical<br />\ntown of Gettysburg, the team<br />\nknew this would be a tough<br />\ncompetition due to the absence<br />\nof Oki and Kim. Anything<br />\ncould happen.<br />\nAt the start of the race, Jay<br />\nHarriers Maureen Shea and<br />\nMolly Bardsley were in the<br />\nlead. At the one mile marker,<br />\nShea was still in front, but then<br />\nshe lost her lead and she only<br />\nmanaged to finish 12th overall.<br />\nAs Green said, \"This was not<br />\nMaureen's day.\"<br />\nIn spite of all the commotion<br />\non the trail, Bardsley finished<br />\nin first place, followed by King<br />\nin 3rd, McGinn in 5th, Gozansky in 10th and the bewildered<br />\nShea in 12th. Also finishing<br />\nstrong for the Jays were Lucy<br />\nWilson in 13th and Nonnie<br />\nEstella in 15th. The final<br />\ntabulation of the score gave<br />\nGettysburg a 3 point edge over<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe Jays' next meet is tomorrow at 2:00 up at the track. Facing opponents from Lebanon<br />\nValley and Ursinus, this meet<br />\nshould be fun if it provides only half the excitement of last<br />\nweek's meets. Added incentive<br />\nto view is that male Harriers<br />\nare due to perform against their<br />\nopponents from said schools.<br />\nSpectators will be able to see<br />\nharrier George (Electric) Raiser<br />\nas he hopes to continue his winning form last shown when he<br />\nunmercifully trashed cornpetitiors from Swarthmore.<br /><br />\nAfter a sluggish start, the Netsters have begun to swing into form in their<br />\n1985 campaign.

It started well as<br />\nHopkins edged a very tough<br />\nMt. St. Mary's team, 5-4, but<br />\nended on somewhat of a sour<br />\nnote as the Jays lost to a much<br />\nweaker Catholic University<br />\nsquad.<br />\nThe away match against Mt.<br />\nSt. Mary's proved to be what<br />\ncoach Kay Fowler Dressler called \"the highlight of the year so<br />\nfar.\" The Jays played some<br />\ngutsy tennis to split the singles,<br />\n3-3. All three singles matches<br />\nwon by Hopkins were 3-setters,<br />\nan indication of their mental<br />\ntoughness. Kathy March won at<br />\nno. 2 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. FowlerDressler commented, \"I told her<br />\nwe needed a win before the<br />\nmatch and she got it. Kathy just<br />\nplayed really well.\"<br />\nVictories at singles also came<br />\nfrom no. 4 Monica Canilang<br />\nwho posted a tough 7-6, 6-2, 7-6<br />\nwin and Huong Pham who won<br />\n4-6, 6-3, 6-3. No. 1 Kay Nelson,<br />\nand no. 5 Brigid Joyce all lost<br />\nin straight sets.<br />\nTied at 3-all, Hopkins needed to win 2 of 3 in doubles to<br />\npost its 4th victory. Nelson and<br /><br />\nMarch won a key match at first<br />\ndoubles, 6-4, 7-5, while Emmick<br />\nand Joyce dropped their no. 2<br />\ndoubles match. Matches were<br />\ntied at 4-all and the outcome<br />\nhinged on no. 3 doubles.<br />\nCanilang and Pham would easily be winners. However, when<br />\nCanilang twisted her ankle, it<br />\nseemed that Hopkins would<br />\nhave to default. But with tears<br />\nin her eyes, and tape on her<br />\nankle, Canilang continued.<br />\nCanilang and Pham managed<br />\nto take the 2nd set 7-5, locking<br />\nup a win for the Jays.<br />\nIn their next match, a home<br />\ncontest against Catholic<br />\nUniversity, the Jays played<br />\nuninspired tennis, perhaps a<br />\nresult of a letdown after their<br />\nvictory over Mt. St. Mary's.<br />\nOne bright spot was the continued good play of Huong<br />\nPham, who is still undefeated<br />\non the year. The only other<br />\nwinners were Captain Kay<br />\nNelson at no. 1, and the first<br />\ndoubles team of Nelson and<br />\nMarch.<br />\nThe State Tournament is<br />\ntomorrow and Saturday, and a<br />\nrematch against Mt.

St. Mary's.<br />\nThe Trinity game was played<br />\non a muddy field in a light rain,<br />\nbut the Jays' spirits were soaring. Alicia Collins tallied the<br />\nfirst two goals of the game on<br />\npenalty strokes, after the Trinity goalkeeper twice fouled to<br />\nprevent Hopkins from scoring.<br />\nHeather Klink replied with a<br />\nhat trick, slamming the ball into the cage on three separate occasions. Kacie White and Jennifer Kenoian each added one<br />\npoint for the Lady Jays. April<br />\nSavoye, Jackie Fatula, and<br /><br />\nKenoian all had assists. The<br />\nseven total goals broke<br />\nHopkins' record for number of<br />\ngoals scored in one game.<br />\nThe team then traveled to<br />\ntake on Mt. St. Mary's.<br />\nHopkins got on the board first<br />\nwith a goal from Collins midway through the first half. The<br />\nopponents tied it up in the second half and sent the game into overtime. After a scoreless<br />\nfirst overtime period, a second<br />\nten minutes period was played,<br />\nin which Mt.

St.<br />\nMary's by soundly defeating<br />\nHood 3-0. The first two goals<br />\nwere scored by April Savoye off<br /><br />\npenalty corners. Patti Ordonez,<br />\nwho had been psyched to score<br />\nall game, added an insurance<br />\ngoal late in the second half. The<br />\ndefense played an excellent<br />\ngame, too, and with several<br />\nspectacular saves from goalie<br />\nAmy Zimmerman, held Hood<br />\nscoreless.<br />\nThe hocksters' next game is<br />\nagainst UMBC and will be<br />\nplayed at 7:00 pm on Tuesday,<br />\nOctober 15, on Homewood<br />\nField.
