WYMAN.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, February 1st, 1901.<br />\nTo the Trustees ofthe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nCity.<br />\nGENTLEMEN:\u2014Having been consulted by Mr.<br />\nWm. Wyman in reference to his generous intentions, which have now taken definite form in his<br />\nletter to you of January 31st, I am impressed<br />\nwith the great possibilities his offer presents,not<br />\nonly to the University, but to the City of Baltimore. It is difficult to overestimate the advantages already conferred upon this community by<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University, and it is even<br />\nmore difficult to forecast what it has in store for<br />\nthe future, if at this critical period in its history,<br />\nit isgenerously sustained. The time has unquestionably come when this Institution must either<br />\nmove vigorously forward, or enter upon a period<br />\nof decadence, to allow which I cannot but feel<br />\nwill be a reflection upon the intelligence and<br />\npublic spirit of our city.<br />\nJudging from the experience of other places,<br />\nand looking at our own past history, it'requires<br />\nno prophetic eye to see that in the time to come<br />\nthis magnificent estate, should you see your way<br />\nto accept it, will become the center of the intellectual and artistic life of the city,and a constant<br />\nincentive to the exercise of that liberality which<br />\nis the distinguishing characteristic of the age.<br />\nEntertaining these views,I esteem it to be both<br />\na duty and privilege to aid in carrying out Mr.<br />\nWyman's plans, and hereby agree to give $200,000 of the $1,000,000 which he stipulates shall<br />\nbe raised; or, should the Trustees agree with me<br />\nthat it will be more to the interest of the University to receive an increased amount of land,<br />\nlooking to the Institution's future growth, I<br />\nhereby agree in lieu of this $200,000, to donate<br />\n60 additional acres of the Homewood Estate<br />\nimmediately adjoining that which Mr. Wyman<br />\nproposes to give, and upon which I have, with<br />\nthis object in view,obtained an option at $225,000. Should this latter offer be accepted, the<br />\nUniversity will conic into the possession of 120<br />\nacres of land, lying in a compact body on the<br />\nWest side of Charles Street,singularly well located<br />\nfor its purposes. I submit to you herewith the<br />\nlegal papers embracing the alternate propositions above mentioned. Very respectfully yours,<br />\n(Signed.) WM.

As described on another page, the<br />\nestate of Homewood, with adjacent property,in<br />\nall about 176 acres ofadmirably situated wooded<br />\nland, has been given by generous citizens as the<br />\nfuture home of the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThere is no limit to the possibilities which the<br />\npossession of this land opens to us. There is<br />\nample room for all the buildings that may be<br />\ndesigned to occupy it, for a campus of any<br />\ndesired extent, for shady walks and pleasant<br />\npromenades, and opportunity for architectural<br />\nadornment which can transform this naturally<br />\nbeautiful tract into as fine college surroundings<br />\nas are to be found anywhere in this country. Its<br />\nconvenient proximity to the city will permit of<br />\nthe enjoyment of city advantages, while at the<br />\nsame time realizing all the benefits of seclusion<br />\nand country life. There will be better opportu.<br />\nnities for scientific work, which has been so<br />\nincommoded in the present physical laboratory,<br />\nand more freedom from distracting environments for all branches of work.<br />\nAs President Gilman has said, the place itself<br />\nwill be an inspiration to future \"givers of good<br />\ngifts,\" and once started on an era of improvement and regeneration, the aids to the work will<br />\nbe numerous. l'eople are not commonly inspired<br />\nto aid a poor, struggling institution which presents a poverty-stricken appearance to the out-<br />\n<br />\nshier, but let its fortunes change, and its air be<br />\nthat of prosperity and advancement, the principle of\"to him that hath shall be given,\" conies<br />\ninto play as a potent factor.<br />\nThere is no doubt that the establishment of<br />\nthe University in that already fashionable section will immensely raise the value of surrounding property, and we may expect to see at some<br />\nfuture day Homewood the center of one of the<br />\nfinest of American suburbs.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nIt has been suggested that we make February<br />\n5th the day on which the news of this gift was<br />\nmade known, an official University holiday, to<br />\nbe known as Announcement Day. At any rate,<br />\nwe shall certainly regard February as our anniversary month\u2014the shortest of the year,and yet<br />\nthe most pregnant with University fortunes.<br />\nThe names of Mr. William Wyman and Mr.<br />\nWilliam Keyser, with those of their as yet unknown co-benefactors, shall ever be regarded<br />\nwith all the honor and reverence that has<br />\nhitherto been accorded to the memory of the<br />\nUniversity's founder.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nThe Alumni have rallied to the support of the<br />\nUniversity in a most gratifying way by their<br />\nmovement to raise a fund to be devoted to laying<br />\nout the new grounds. After some discussion of<br />\nthe relative merits of a library fund and an athletic field, the conclusion is reached to hand over<br />\nthe fund which may be raised to the Trustees to<br />\nbe employed in a competition of landscape artists<br />\nfor a plan of architectural arrangement. As<br />\nsoon as the whole effect to be produced is seen,<br />\na portion will be laid out as a foot-ball and<br />\nlacrosse field to be used by the Hopkins teams<br />\nperpetuum.<br />\nThis prompt response of the Alumni to the<br />\nneeds of the case merits our most sincere appreciation, and \"Alumni Field\" will ever stand as<br />\ntheir monument.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nOne of the early effects of the rise in University<br />\nstock is the way in which local dealers have<br />\nrecognized the University colors and emblems<br />\nmore extensively. It used to be that one could<br />\nrarely find a Hopkins flag in town, and those<br />\nwho did make a feature of college trinkets usu-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nally represented us by black and yellow.

The principal address will be delivered<br />\nby Hon. David Jayne Hill, LL. D., Assistant Secretary of State, and formerly President of the<br />\nUniversity of Rochester. The students of the<br />\nMedical School and of the University will form<br />\na procession at half-past ten o'clock in the morning and march into McCoy Hall, led by Dr. Renouf and Dr. Ames. From present indications it<br />\nis expected that the exercises will be more impressive than ever before, for many important<br />\nchanges have taken place since last Commemoration Day. President Gilman has tendered his<br />\nresignation to the Trustees and will publicly resign on Friday. Then it is hoped some definite<br />\ninformation as to the plans to be followed in<br />\nraising the million dollar fund will be made<br />\nknown. Several degrees of Doctor of Philosophy<br />\nwill be conferred immediately after the principal<br />\naddress. The faculty hope and expect every<br />\nmember of the University to be present on this<br />\nday, for it will very probably mark a turning<br />\npoint in the history of the institution.<br />\n9r 9r 9r<br />\nEvery Alumni Association of the University<br />\nscattered over this country from Maine to California, and also the one in Japan, will hold its<br />\nanuual banquet on the night of Commemoration<br />\nDay.

I. Pupin, of Columbia<br />\nUuiversity, lecture in McCoy Hall, on his improved methods of telephony and the possibility<br />\nof a submarine telephone. Dr. Pupin spoke for<br />\nabout an hour and a half in a most intense vet<br />\nquiet manner, gradually leading his hearers up<br />\nfrom simple physical principles to his own discovery, which may work revolutions in long distance telegraphic and telephonic possibilities of<br />\nthe future. The plan appeared simple, and rests<br />\non the fact that coils placed at intervals around<br />\na current-bearing wire increases the energy of<br />\nthe current. This is analogous to the use of<br />\nweights to prevent diminution of the amplitude<br />\nin a wave produced by a rope moved by the<br />\nhand.<br />\nDr. Pupin's personal characteristics as shown<br />\nby the lecture are very interesting. He speaksin<br />\nan exceedingly deliberate manner, with a slight<br />\naccent, and is absolutely forgetful of himself in<br />\nhis earnestness. He is a Servian by birth, and<br />\nworked his way through Columbia College to a<br />\nscholarship at graduation to the University of<br />\nBerlin. He is very modest, and in the lecture<br />\nalways referred to his discoveries, as \"what we<br />\nhave done\" in the laboratory, or \"what we accomplished.\" As Dr. Ames stated at the close of<br />\nthe lecture, Prof. Pupin is a great example of<br />\nthose University men who, by difficult scientific<br />\nand abstruse mathematical deductions, work<br />\nout marvellous discoveries, that are full of practical benefits to the world in general. University<br />\nmen are gradually forging ahead of mechanics<br />\nand engineers in inventing practical means of<br />\nadvancing the civilization of the world.<br />\nDr. Gilpin, the secretary of the Scientific Association, states that attempts will be made this<br />\nyear to have one or two more public lectures on<br />\nnew discoveries.<br />\nior Mir or<br />\n<br />\nThere has been a new system formed at<br />\nHarvard under which retired proffessors may<br />\nreceive pensions.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nRECENT BAN JO CLUB CONCERTS.<br />\nthe last issue of the NEWS-LETTER, the<br />\nSINCE<br />\nBanjo Club has played twice in Baltimore.<br />\nIn this connection it is gratifying to note the<br />\ngood reputation that the Clubs of this season<br />\nhave earned, and the hospitality that has everywhere been extended to the men.<br />\nAt the Boundary Avenue Presbyterian Church,<br />\non Friday the 8th, the Banjo Club assisted at a<br />\nconcert. The Hopkins men were programmed<br />\nfor two selections. As an encore to the first,<br />\nSmith's String Quartette made its first appearance on any stage. After a few false starts, it<br />\nwas discovered that some of the instruments<br />\ndiffered as to pitch. But after a dignified retreat,<br />\nthe quartette again braved the audience, and<br />\nthis time triumphantly swept through Smith's<br />\nlatest opus: \"The Twilight of the Cove.\" After<br />\nthe second piece, the enthusiastic banjo pickers<br />\nformed themselves into a glee club, and sang<br />\n\"Praise to dear old Hopkins.\"<br />\nThis evening's entertainment was given under<br />\nthe auspices of the Y.

Different in<br />\ncharacter, but still enjoyable, was that of the<br />\nnext night (Saturday the 9th), when the banjo<br />\nplayers were guests at a \"blow out\" of the<br />\nBaltimore Club. The usual performances were<br />\nenlivened by various solos of Messrs. Smith and<br />\nSwindell.

A. C. GAMES.<br />\n<br />\nshowing made by our track team at the<br />\nTHEannual<br />\nindoor meet of the Baltimore<br />\nAthletic Club last Saturday night was such as<br />\nto make every Hopkins heart throb with pleasure. Notwithstanding the losses of last year,<br />\nevery track event was won by Hopkins men,and<br />\nin the field events a creditable showing was<br />\nmade. Brem took first place in the running<br />\nhigh jump,but owing to miserable handicapping<br />\nall the other Hopkins men entered in these events<br />\nwere \"frozen out.\"<br />\nThe novices did such work as reflects great<br />\ncredit on the team as a whole and upon the<br />\nuntiring zeal of Director Mackdermott who has<br />\nworked so religiously with them. But too much<br />\ncan not be said in praise of all the men, for<br />\nwhether he won a place or not, everyone did his<br />\nlevel best.<br />\nPerhaps the event which was most interesting<br />\nto Hopkins \"rooters\" was the open relay race<br />\nin which were entered J. H. U., the West Branch<br />\nY. M. C. A., the Western High School, Washington, and the Central High School, Washington.<br />\nThe feature of this race was the beautiful running of England, whose work in that event is<br />\nespecially commendable. Both Tootle and<br />\nWhitman distinguished themselves in the 40yard dash by winning first and second places<br />\nrespectively, in the finals. Tootle, who is a<br />\nnovice ran in excellent form, and Whitman is<br />\nstill one of Hopkins' most reliable runners, so<br />\nthat both these men may be depended upon for<br />\nwinning future races for old \"Johnny Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe half mile-880 yard run\u2014was captured<br />\nby Morfit Mullen, J. H. U.,'99, who entered as<br />\na representative of the Athletic Association of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Club. The 440-yard dash<br />\nwas a \"walkover\" for Hopkins, Riggs winning<br />\nfirst place with Atkinson an easy second.<br />\nAs we have often noted before, handicapping<br />\nis an excellent thing for equalizing, to some<br />\nextent, the abilities of the competitors, but<br />\nthere should be no such discrimination as there<br />\nwas on last Saturday night. Blanck, who was<br />\nentered in the shot putting as a novice, was<br />\ngiven only 11 feet, while Lillis, also a novice, had<br />\na handicap of 12 feet and won the event,<br />\n<br />\nalthough Blanck's actual put was much better<br />\nthan Lillis'. Not only in this, but also in other<br />\nevents it looked very much as if an attempt was<br />\nbeing made to \"do\" Hopkins.<br />\nAs a whole,the meet was one of the most successful ever held in this city, and athletes representing fourteen clubs competed in the various<br />\nevents. The hall was especially arranged to<br />\naccommodate the spectators. Upstairs in the<br />\ngallery were the \"rooters\" from the various<br />\nclubs and institutions interested, while down on<br />\nthe main floor were reserved seats filled with<br />\nenthusiastic spectators.<br />\nFollowing is a list of events in which representatives of Hopkins participated:\u2014<br />\nTRACK EVENTS.<br />\nFour Hundred and Forty Yard Dash\u2014T.

The participants in the affair<br />\nlined up around a hole dug by Henry Rippel, the<br />\ncontractor, and in which wood ashes smouldered, as the ground was so frozen that no selfrespecting silver spade could make an impression<br />\non it without the aid of a thawing fire.<br />\nDr. John B.

Dr. Edward<br />\nRenouf, representing President Gilman, of Hopkins, made another neat address, and Judge<br />\nHarry Goldman responded on behalf of the baseball company. After each speech the orator<br />\njumped into the hole and dug out a spadeful of<br />\nearth with a silver spade prepared especially for<br />\nthis occasion. In the center of the hole and supported by a 'peg was placed -a horseshoe that<br />\nhad been handed to the party by an enthusiastic<br />\nblacksmith, who had stopped the procession as<br />\nthey were on the way to the grounds, for that<br />\nspecific purpose.<br />\n<br />\nof *<br />\nMORE ATHLETIC GROUNDS FOR<br />\nHOPKINS.<br />\n<br />\nUST at present, athletic fields seem to be droping from the skies for Hopkins.

President<br />\nGilman has been authorized to employ whatever<br />\nmeans he may choose to raise the necessary<br />\n$1,000,000 named in the grant,and it is believed<br />\nand confidently asserted that the sum will be<br />\nrealized without difficulty and without recourse<br />\nto the $200,000 offered by Mr. Keyser in lieu of<br />\nthe land grant if the Trustees so desired.

I desire to present this body of land to<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University, provided you<br />\ndeem it to its interest to accept the gift, coupled<br />\nwith an agreement that such portion ofthe land<br />\nas may be necessary shall eventually be used for<br />\nthe site of the University; that I shall retain the<br />\nuse of my dwelling during my life; and that you<br />\nwill offer to the city ten acres, more or less, for a<br />\npublic park in fulfillment of a promise made by<br />\nme some years ago, and subject to the further<br />\ncondition, that the sum of one million dollars be<br />\ngiven to the University by others, in order that<br />\nthis gift, which is designed by me for the future<br />\nbenefit of the institution, may not at this time<br />\nbe a burden to it.<br />\nI have had the offer put in a legal and binding<br />\nform, with details more fully expressed, as will<br />\nappear from the accompanying papers.<br />\nIt will give me and my family sincere pleasure<br />\nif, by complying with the terms therein, you can<br />\nsee your way to accept the land which has been<br />\nthe homestead of my family for over sixty years.<br />\nIt will be a source of pride to me to feel that this<br />\nproperty will in the future be occupied by an institution, which in the past has shed so much<br />\nluster upon my native city, and which bids fair<br />\nto be of such lasting benefit to those who come<br />\nafter us.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\n(Signed) WM. WYMAN.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, February 1st, 1901.<br />\nTo the Trustees ofthe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nCity.<br />\nGENTLEMEN:\u2014Having been consulted by Mr.<br />\nWm. Wyman in reference to his generous intentions, which have now taken definite form in his<br />\nletter to you of January 31st, I am impressed<br />\nwith the great possibilities his offer presents,not<br />\nonly to the University, but to the City of Baltimore. It is difficult to overestimate the advantages already conferred upon this community by<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University, and it is even<br />\nmore difficult to forecast what it has in store for<br />\nthe future, if at this critical period in its history,<br />\nit isgenerously sustained. The time has unquestionably come when this Institution must either<br />\nmove vigorously forward, or enter upon a period<br />\nof decadence, to allow which I cannot but feel<br />\nwill be a reflection upon the intelligence and<br />\npublic spirit of our city.<br />\nJudging from the experience of other places,<br />\nand looking at our own past history, it'requires<br />\nno prophetic eye to see that in the time to come<br />\nthis magnificent estate, should you see your way<br />\nto accept it, will become the center of the intellectual and artistic life of the city,and a constant<br />\nincentive to the exercise of that liberality which<br />\nis the distinguishing characteristic of the age.<br />\nEntertaining these views,I esteem it to be both<br />\na duty and privilege to aid in carrying out Mr.<br />\nWyman's plans, and hereby agree to give $200,000 of the $1,000,000 which he stipulates shall<br />\nbe raised; or, should the Trustees agree with me<br />\nthat it will be more to the interest of the University to receive an increased amount of land,<br />\nlooking to the Institution's future growth, I<br />\nhereby agree in lieu of this $200,000, to donate<br />\n60 additional acres of the Homewood Estate<br />\nimmediately adjoining that which Mr. Wyman<br />\nproposes to give, and upon which I have, with<br />\nthis object in view,obtained an option at $225,000. Should this latter offer be accepted, the<br />\nUniversity will conic into the possession of 120<br />\nacres of land, lying in a compact body on the<br />\nWest side of Charles Street,singularly well located<br />\nfor its purposes. I submit to you herewith the<br />\nlegal papers embracing the alternate propositions above mentioned. Very respectfully yours,<br />\n(Signed.) WM.

BANDEL, box 94, J II. U.; or box 398, Medical School of<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital.<br /><br />\nSINCE the beginning of this month,the University has been the recipient of a gift equalled<br />\nonly by the original endowment of Johns Hopkins himself. As described on another page, the<br />\nestate of Homewood, with adjacent property,in<br />\nall about 176 acres ofadmirably situated wooded<br />\nland, has been given by generous citizens as the<br />\nfuture home of the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThere is no limit to the possibilities which the<br />\npossession of this land opens to us. There is<br />\nample room for all the buildings that may be<br />\ndesigned to occupy it, for a campus of any<br />\ndesired extent, for shady walks and pleasant<br />\npromenades, and opportunity for architectural<br />\nadornment which can transform this naturally<br />\nbeautiful tract into as fine college surroundings<br />\nas are to be found anywhere in this country. Its<br />\nconvenient proximity to the city will permit of<br />\nthe enjoyment of city advantages, while at the<br />\nsame time realizing all the benefits of seclusion<br />\nand country life. There will be better opportu.<br />\nnities for scientific work, which has been so<br />\nincommoded in the present physical laboratory,<br />\nand more freedom from distracting environments for all branches of work.<br />\nAs President Gilman has said, the place itself<br />\nwill be an inspiration to future \"givers of good<br />\ngifts,\" and once started on an era of improvement and regeneration, the aids to the work will<br />\nbe numerous. l'eople are not commonly inspired<br />\nto aid a poor, struggling institution which presents a poverty-stricken appearance to the out-<br /><br />\nshier, but let its fortunes change, and its air be<br />\nthat of prosperity and advancement, the principle of\"to him that hath shall be given,\" conies<br />\ninto play as a potent factor.<br />\nThere is no doubt that the establishment of<br />\nthe University in that already fashionable section will immensely raise the value of surrounding property, and we may expect to see at some<br />\nfuture day Homewood the center of one of the<br />\nfinest of American suburbs.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nIt has been suggested that we make February<br />\n5th the day on which the news of this gift was<br />\nmade known, an official University holiday, to<br />\nbe known as Announcement Day. At any rate,<br />\nwe shall certainly regard February as our anniversary month\u2014the shortest of the year,and yet<br />\nthe most pregnant with University fortunes.<br />\nThe names of Mr. William Wyman and Mr.<br />\nWilliam Keyser, with those of their as yet unknown co-benefactors, shall ever be regarded<br />\nwith all the honor and reverence that has<br />\nhitherto been accorded to the memory of the<br />\nUniversity's founder.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nThe Alumni have rallied to the support of the<br />\nUniversity in a most gratifying way by their<br />\nmovement to raise a fund to be devoted to laying<br />\nout the new grounds. After some discussion of<br />\nthe relative merits of a library fund and an athletic field, the conclusion is reached to hand over<br />\nthe fund which may be raised to the Trustees to<br />\nbe employed in a competition of landscape artists<br />\nfor a plan of architectural arrangement. As<br />\nsoon as the whole effect to be produced is seen,<br />\na portion will be laid out as a foot-ball and<br />\nlacrosse field to be used by the Hopkins teams<br />\nperpetuum.<br />\nThis prompt response of the Alumni to the<br />\nneeds of the case merits our most sincere appreciation, and \"Alumni Field\" will ever stand as<br />\ntheir monument.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nOne of the early effects of the rise in University<br />\nstock is the way in which local dealers have<br />\nrecognized the University colors and emblems<br />\nmore extensively. It used to be that one could<br />\nrarely find a Hopkins flag in town, and those<br />\nwho did make a feature of college trinkets usu-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nally represented us by black and yellow.

The principal address will be delivered<br />\nby Hon. David Jayne Hill, LL. D., Assistant Secretary of State, and formerly President of the<br />\nUniversity of Rochester. The students of the<br />\nMedical School and of the University will form<br />\na procession at half-past ten o'clock in the morning and march into McCoy Hall, led by Dr. Renouf and Dr. Ames. From present indications it<br />\nis expected that the exercises will be more impressive than ever before, for many important<br />\nchanges have taken place since last Commemoration Day. President Gilman has tendered his<br />\nresignation to the Trustees and will publicly resign on Friday. Then it is hoped some definite<br />\ninformation as to the plans to be followed in<br />\nraising the million dollar fund will be made<br />\nknown. Several degrees of Doctor of Philosophy<br />\nwill be conferred immediately after the principal<br />\naddress. The faculty hope and expect every<br />\nmember of the University to be present on this<br />\nday, for it will very probably mark a turning<br />\npoint in the history of the institution.<br />\n9r 9r 9r<br />\nEvery Alumni Association of the University<br />\nscattered over this country from Maine to California, and also the one in Japan, will hold its<br />\nanuual banquet on the night of Commemoration<br />\nDay.

Dr. Pupin spoke for<br />\nabout an hour and a half in a most intense vet<br />\nquiet manner, gradually leading his hearers up<br />\nfrom simple physical principles to his own discovery, which may work revolutions in long distance telegraphic and telephonic possibilities of<br />\nthe future. The plan appeared simple, and rests<br />\non the fact that coils placed at intervals around<br />\na current-bearing wire increases the energy of<br />\nthe current. This is analogous to the use of<br />\nweights to prevent diminution of the amplitude<br />\nin a wave produced by a rope moved by the<br />\nhand.<br />\nDr. Pupin's personal characteristics as shown<br />\nby the lecture are very interesting. He speaksin<br />\nan exceedingly deliberate manner, with a slight<br />\naccent, and is absolutely forgetful of himself in<br />\nhis earnestness. He is a Servian by birth, and<br />\nworked his way through Columbia College to a<br />\nscholarship at graduation to the University of<br />\nBerlin. He is very modest, and in the lecture<br />\nalways referred to his discoveries, as \"what we<br />\nhave done\" in the laboratory, or \"what we accomplished.\" As Dr. Ames stated at the close of<br />\nthe lecture, Prof. Pupin is a great example of<br />\nthose University men who, by difficult scientific<br />\nand abstruse mathematical deductions, work<br />\nout marvellous discoveries, that are full of practical benefits to the world in general. University<br />\nmen are gradually forging ahead of mechanics<br />\nand engineers in inventing practical means of<br />\nadvancing the civilization of the world.<br />\nDr. Gilpin, the secretary of the Scientific Association, states that attempts will be made this<br />\nyear to have one or two more public lectures on<br />\nnew discoveries.<br />\nior Mir or<br /><br />\nThere has been a new system formed at<br />\nHarvard under which retired proffessors may<br />\nreceive pensions.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nRECENT BAN JO CLUB CONCERTS.<br />\nthe last issue of the NEWS-LETTER, the<br />\nSINCE<br />\nBanjo Club has played twice in Baltimore.<br />\nIn this connection it is gratifying to note the<br />\ngood reputation that the Clubs of this season<br />\nhave earned, and the hospitality that has everywhere been extended to the men.<br />\nAt the Boundary Avenue Presbyterian Church,<br />\non Friday the 8th, the Banjo Club assisted at a<br />\nconcert. The Hopkins men were programmed<br />\nfor two selections. As an encore to the first,<br />\nSmith's String Quartette made its first appearance on any stage. After a few false starts, it<br />\nwas discovered that some of the instruments<br />\ndiffered as to pitch. But after a dignified retreat,<br />\nthe quartette again braved the audience, and<br />\nthis time triumphantly swept through Smith's<br />\nlatest opus: \"The Twilight of the Cove.\" After<br />\nthe second piece, the enthusiastic banjo pickers<br />\nformed themselves into a glee club, and sang<br />\n\"Praise to dear old Hopkins.\"<br />\nThis evening's entertainment was given under<br />\nthe auspices of the Y. P. S. C. H. Different in<br />\ncharacter, but still enjoyable, was that of the<br />\nnext night (Saturday the 9th), when the banjo<br />\nplayers were guests at a \"blow out\" of the<br />\nBaltimore Club. The usual performances were<br />\nenlivened by various solos of Messrs. Smith and<br />\nSwindell. The \"stunts\" done by the talent<br />\namong the hosts, the bountiful supper, and the<br />\nother refreshments provided, were all of a high<br />\ngrade of excellence.

These games will be open to all registered<br />\nathletes of the Amateur Athletic Association,<br />\nand all the local clubs in this Association, with<br />\nClubs from Washington and other neighboring<br />\ncities will compete. In anticipation of these<br />\ngames, St. Leo's Gymnasium will abandon the<br />\ngames which it had proposed holding during the<br />\nnext few weeks, and will enter largely into the<br />\nHopkins games.<br />\nIt is the intention of Mr. Mackdermott, who<br />\nis arranging for this meet, to make it one of the<br />\nbiggest affairs in the South, to rank with those<br />\ngiven by Georgetown University for the past<br />\nfew winters.

A. C. GAMES.<br /><br />\nshowing made by our track team at the<br />\nTHEannual<br />\nindoor meet of the Baltimore<br />\nAthletic Club last Saturday night was such as<br />\nto make every Hopkins heart throb with pleasure. Notwithstanding the losses of last year,<br />\nevery track event was won by Hopkins men,and<br />\nin the field events a creditable showing was<br />\nmade. Brem took first place in the running<br />\nhigh jump,but owing to miserable handicapping<br />\nall the other Hopkins men entered in these events<br />\nwere \"frozen out.\"<br />\nThe novices did such work as reflects great<br />\ncredit on the team as a whole and upon the<br />\nuntiring zeal of Director Mackdermott who has<br />\nworked so religiously with them. But too much<br />\ncan not be said in praise of all the men, for<br />\nwhether he won a place or not, everyone did his<br />\nlevel best.<br />\nPerhaps the event which was most interesting<br />\nto Hopkins \"rooters\" was the open relay race<br />\nin which were entered J. H. U., the West Branch<br />\nY. M. C. A., the Western High School, Washington, and the Central High School, Washington.<br />\nThe feature of this race was the beautiful running of England, whose work in that event is<br />\nespecially commendable. Both Tootle and<br />\nWhitman distinguished themselves in the 40yard dash by winning first and second places<br />\nrespectively, in the finals. Tootle, who is a<br />\nnovice ran in excellent form, and Whitman is<br />\nstill one of Hopkins' most reliable runners, so<br />\nthat both these men may be depended upon for<br />\nwinning future races for old \"Johnny Hopkins.\"<br />\nThe half mile-880 yard run\u2014was captured<br />\nby Morfit Mullen, J. H. U.,'99, who entered as<br />\na representative of the Athletic Association of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Club. The 440-yard dash<br />\nwas a \"walkover\" for Hopkins, Riggs winning<br />\nfirst place with Atkinson an easy second.<br />\nAs we have often noted before, handicapping<br />\nis an excellent thing for equalizing, to some<br />\nextent, the abilities of the competitors, but<br />\nthere should be no such discrimination as there<br />\nwas on last Saturday night. Blanck, who was<br />\nentered in the shot putting as a novice, was<br />\ngiven only 11 feet, while Lillis, also a novice, had<br />\na handicap of 12 feet and won the event,<br /><br />\nalthough Blanck's actual put was much better<br />\nthan Lillis'. Not only in this, but also in other<br />\nevents it looked very much as if an attempt was<br />\nbeing made to \"do\" Hopkins.<br />\nAs a whole,the meet was one of the most successful ever held in this city, and athletes representing fourteen clubs competed in the various<br />\nevents. The hall was especially arranged to<br />\naccommodate the spectators. Upstairs in the<br />\ngallery were the \"rooters\" from the various<br />\nclubs and institutions interested, while down on<br />\nthe main floor were reserved seats filled with<br />\nenthusiastic spectators.<br />\nFollowing is a list of events in which representatives of Hopkins participated:\u2014<br />\nTRACK EVENTS.<br />\nFour Hundred and Forty Yard Dash\u2014T.

The participants in the affair<br />\nlined up around a hole dug by Henry Rippel, the<br />\ncontractor, and in which wood ashes smouldered, as the ground was so frozen that no selfrespecting silver spade could make an impression<br />\non it without the aid of a thawing fire.<br />\nDr. John B. Sehwatka, as the representative of<br />\nGovernor Smith, made a fine speech, in which he<br />\nproclaimed the public value ofbase-ball, deplored<br />\nthe loss of a team to this city last season, and<br />\nbespoke hearty support this year. Dr. Edward<br />\nRenouf, representing President Gilman, of Hopkins, made another neat address, and Judge<br />\nHarry Goldman responded on behalf of the baseball company. After each speech the orator<br />\njumped into the hole and dug out a spadeful of<br />\nearth with a silver spade prepared especially for<br />\nthis occasion. In the center of the hole and supported by a 'peg was placed -a horseshoe that<br />\nhad been handed to the party by an enthusiastic<br />\nblacksmith, who had stopped the procession as<br />\nthey were on the way to the grounds, for that<br />\nspecific purpose.<br /><br />\nof *<br />\nMORE ATHLETIC GROUNDS FOR<br />\nHOPKINS.<br /><br />\nUST at present, athletic fields seem to be droping from the skies for Hopkins. Besides the<br />\nclub-house and field which we expect to have<br />\nsoon, on the new base-ball grounds,the Hopkins<br />\nAlumni propose to give us still another athletic<br />\nfield on the site for the new University. It was<br />\nat first suggested that money be raised for a<br />\nlibrary fund, but the idea of a new athletic field<br />\nand immediate occupancy was received with<br />\ngreater favor.<br />\nThe whole of the grounds will be cleared off,<br />\n\u2022 and a suitable portion selected, and put in condition for track, field, lacrosse and football,<br />\nwhile the rest of the grounds will be used by the<br />\npublic as a park, until the new buildings are<br />\nerected.<br /><br />\nJ<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nAt a meeting of the Alumni at the Hopkins<br />\nClub, Saturday afternoon, it was resolved to begin clearing off the ground, as soon as the million<br />\ndollars is raised, and contributions will be immediately solicited from members of the Alumni as<br />\nwell as from others who are interested;\u2014in fact,<br />\na few contributions have already been received.<br />\nEven as early as next Friday\u2014Commemoration Day\u2014there is a rumor afloat that President<br />\nGilman will announce that a million dollars has<br />\nbeen raised; then comes the new athletic field<br />\nand later the new University.<br />\nW Sr W<br /><br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nMANAGER BYRNE of the Lacrosse team is<br />\nquite busy arranging his schedule for the<br />\ncoming season.
