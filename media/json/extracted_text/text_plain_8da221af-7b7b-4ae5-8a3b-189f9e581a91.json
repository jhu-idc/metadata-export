As a matter of fact, few tasks are more simple. The rub comes<br />\nafter the song is written, and the real work consists in making a popular song popular. There is only one way under the sun to do this and that is<br />\nto let people hear it.<br />\nI have received hundreds of letters reading about like this:<br />\n\"DEAR MR. HAVRZ-I have just completed a song and want you to tell me<br />\nhow to make it popular. It strikes me as possessing all the catchy features of<br />\nthe present day 'hits,' and I don't see why it shouldn't be a go, etc., etc.\"<br />\nMy invariable reply is, \"Get someone on the stage to sing it.\" This is the<br />\ntrue secret of making a song popular. Just about ninety per cent. of the hits<br />\nof today in the song field are the most inane things imaginable, and anybody<br />\nWho would prophecy success for any one of them before it was produced would<br />\nbe voted crazy by a jury of his fellows; but the fact remains that the most<br />\nmediocre song in the world, if pumped into the public ear night after night,<br />\nwill make some kind of a hit.<br />\nNowadays, publishers pay actresses, excuse the word, for singing their<br />\nsongs. About fifty soubrettes were warbling \"Dolly Gray\" for' a specified<br />\nsum per week. The result was it made a hit. \"I must a been Dreamin'\" was<br />\nanother that had to be pushed with money. Yet it scored heavily. Both these<br />\nsongs were purchased by the publisher in a bunch of fifty or more ditties<br />\nacquired by a firm that failed, which were afterwards disposed of for almost<br />\nnothing.<br />\n\"Annie Moore,\" that nightmare of harmony, lay in a publisher's safe about<br />\nfive years before he thought fit to put it out. \"Hello, my Baby,\" was hawked<br />\nabout to many New York ,publishers, all of whom refused it, saying that it was<br />\nrot. It was finally sold to one publisher for $5, and when he bought it he<br />\nthought he had been buncoed.<br />\nA stranger with a bundle of songs stands as much chance in New York<br />\namong the publishers as a book agent. He is put off, told to wait, asked to<br />\nCome in again, or told the manager is busy and can't see him. I have seen<br />\nmany a sad sight in the New York publishing houses. Composers with really<br />\ngood material, anxious to play their work to the publisher, wait in vain for an<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nOn one occasion I was sitting in the private office of a large publisher when<br />\nthe outer guard, if I may so call him, entered and said that there was a young<br />\nman outside with three songs to submit. \"Tell him I'm busy or I'm out or in<br />\nChicago, or anything,\" said the publisher, and turning to me, continued:<br />\n<br />\nTi<br />\n<br />\nse<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\"You have no idea of the manner in which I'm bothered by these people.<br />\nWhy if I listened to all their rot I wouldn't have time to attend to any part of<br />\nmy business.\"<br />\nMy mission being ended, I went into the outer office and saw a picture of woe. The man who had asked for the publisher had a bundle of badly<br />\nsoiled songs under his arm. and a woe-begone expression on his face. Notwithstanding the fact that there was a heavy snowfall, his shoes were so worn<br />\nthat his toes protruded. I took him into one of the palatial rooms near by,<br />\nand motioned him to the piano. He drew his hands from his trousers pockets<br />\nand tried to play, but his fingers were numb with the cold. I sent out for some<br />\nbrandy for him and under its influence he was soon able to use his fingers. He<br />\nthen played three excessively pretty songs, which I insisted on the publisher<br />\nhearing. The result was that all three songs were accepted; one of them is at<br />\nthe present time a distinct hit.<br />\nHow different it is with a man or a woman who has written a successful<br />\nsong! The moment a successful song writer walks into a publisher's office, he<br />\nis almost hugged. His slightest word is eagerly listened to, and every comment<br />\nhe makes is carefully taken note of. Everything is done to make him comfortable, and be feels a degree of elation that is remarkable. All this because<br />\nhe has written something in the popular vein, and the publisher wants another<br />\nmoney-maker from him.<br />\nIt is a senseless method of procedure to publish a song anywhere except in<br />\nNew York City. That is the home .of the actor and singer. and consequently<br />\nthe stronghold of the publisher. It is a thousand to one bet that a hit cannot<br />\nbe made of a song except when it is published in New York<br />\nLast, but not least, no publisher will take up a song that is in any degree<br />\ncomplicated or \"good.\" The music must be commonplace and the words even<br />\nmore so. The publisher says: ''The public want trash; why not give it to<br />\nJEAN C. HAVEZ.<br />\nthem ?\" And there you are.<br />\nA PLEA FOR SIMPLICITY IN DICTION.<br />\nOW often are we imposed upon by the clang of cymbals and the clash of<br />\nsounding brass! How often the very makers of this noise deceive themselves! Writers and speakers are often prone to swell their periods with<br />\nhigh-sounding words, merely for the sake of sound. Not only is this to be found<br />\nin the speeches of the curbstone orator and of the ranting preacher, but even<br />\nin higher intellectual strata. Charlatans are more numerous in literary fields<br />\nto-day than they ever were in the time of the original magician. We have dross '<br />\nshowered upon us. We are stormed at until our ear-drums protest against the<br />\nstrain.<br />\nThere are two great reasons for the existence of this empty fiuff ball style<br />\nof language. The first is a desire to dress up in tinsel; the second cause, and<br />\nprobably the most usual, is the lack of cogent, logical thought upon the subject<br />\nmatter.<br />\n<br />\ng<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nIt is not surprising that a student who has just made his acquaintance with<br />\na number of \"large\" words should be anxious to exercise his vocabulary to its<br />\nfull extent. In a debate in our halls, a \"senator\" relieved himself of the following sententious bundle of words which had been weighing upon his mind:<br />\nGentlemen, we postulate our position under the orderly march of cumulative<br />\nfacts.\" Having howled this out, his face beamed with conscious pride, and his<br />\nchest was strained to its utmost capacity.<br />\nNor is the undergraduate the only one who seeks to impress his audience.<br />\nA graduate student of several years standing perplexed a seminary meeting by<br />\nusing the term \"altruistic individualism.\" \"Subjective-objectivity\" was once<br />\nventured in a lecture room.<br />\nNor again have we reached the limit to which this sin pervades our halls of<br />\nlearning. I have heard even worthy instructors upon \"off days\" spin out the<br />\nthread of their discourse so thin that it was in imminent danger of being worn<br />\nout in the process.<br />\nUpon one occasion while taking notes in a lecture, my mind wandered, and<br />\nmy note taking became merely mechanical. Upon reading the note-book over,<br />\nI found one simple proposition stated in six different ways.<br />\nOnce upon a time a Spaniard, without any knowledge whatever of the Ung\u2022<br />\nlish language, attempted to translate with the aid of a bilingual dictionary the<br />\nClassics of his tongue into English. The result is most grotesque\u2014a conglomeration of words thrown higglity-pigglity upon the page, full of sound but<br />\nmeaningless.<br />\nThis poor Spaniard knew no better, and may be pardoned with a pitying<br />\nsmile, but for the deliberate villian who stones us with mere \"words, words,<br />\nwords,\" no fate is too hard.<br />\nSometimes the long-winded, gorgeous-hued language conveys ideas worth<br />\ngetting, but one is very apt to be so engrossed in examining the wax flowers as<br />\nto miss the meaning, disproportionate as it is to the sound and length of the<br />\nexpressing medium.<br />\nA famous lawyer, while addressing a jury, having used all the epithetics<br />\nin the dictionary, hesitated a moment, and then added, \"this naufrageons ruffian.\" He was afterwards asked what the word meant, and replied that he did<br />\nnot know, but \"he thought it sounded well.\"<br />\nThat is the raison d'etre of so many a speech; sound instead of sense. Now,<br />\nIn our \"hurry up\" day, we have not the time to waste upon mere sound.<br />\nThose who enjoy it had better take themselves to a \"boiler shop.\" The<br />\nSpeech abounding in \"glittering generalities,\" which states the proposition<br />\nthat 2+2-4 in language worthy of Cicero, is aptly described by the slang expression \"hot air.\"<br />\nTo escape the charge of \"hot airing\" myself, I will drop my pen before<br />\nexhibiting too many examples of the evil I have been abusing.<br />\nR.

THE NEws-LnTTER is the only<br />\nstudent periodical publication of the University. It has to combine, in greater<br />\nor less degree, the features of a news weekly, a literary monthly, and a comic<br />\npaper. In preparing and stirring up such a mixture, the editors have their<br />\ntroubles. The recompense they are looking to is your hearty support, not<br />\nonly with your subscriptions, but in no less degree with contributions of matter suitable for publication.<br />\nNext, to our critics. It is true that criticism is a salutary thing; the editors fully realize this, and are duly thankful for having been saved so often.<br />\nBut we cannot help thinking sometimes: If you are so solicitous about the<br />\nreputation of the paper, why don't you help to improve it? The little trouble<br />\nneeded to jot down and hand in the idea for an article, sketch, or poem, would<br />\nvery often bring about an attractive feature in the next number. And to those<br />\nfew,\u2014for there are a few,\u2014who confess to a lack of immediate interest in the<br />\npaper, we would say: Did you ever think that the THE NEWS-LETTER iS exchanged to most colleges of note in the United States and Canada, and that<br />\nfrom it many men in these colleges will get their idea of the quantity and<br />\nquality of spirit in our undergradnate life? If you have at heart, in the slightest degree, the reputation of the college, you will put some little effort into<br />\nhelping its official representative abroad.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nFinally, to our friends. The appearance of the sheet is changed somewhat,<br />\nand it is intended to have a different cover with each issue. The paper is circulating more widely among the alumni, and for this reason it is desired to enlarge the colutim of alumni news much as possible. In getting ideas and notes<br />\nin these departments, we ask for the same cordial co-operation that you have<br />\nshown us so often in the past.<br />\nWO places are open to candidates on the Board of Editors. One, for a '05<br />\nman, is the post of assistant athletic editor; the other, that of assistant<br />\nbusiness manager, which leads to the business managership next year,<br />\nand is, therefore, open to all Juniors, For information about the work to be<br />\ndone in getting these places, apply to any of the board.<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\nHE question of the existence of a 1902 foot-ball team is the first that will<br />\noccupy the attention of the newly elected Athletic Board. Since 1897,<br />\nthe University has had a team each season, and it has always been well<br />\nsupported and creditable. This year, however, the prospect is very doubtful.<br />\nThere are not more than half a dozen men in the undergraduate department<br />\nwho are up to the standard of a Hopkins team, and some difficulty has been experienced in making up the number at the medical school. It would seem that<br />\namong our entering class of 101, from colleges in every part of the States, a few<br />\nenthusiasts could be found. But the change in the schedule of the first-year work<br />\nis keeping the class so busy that even the most enthusiastic dread to lose from<br />\ntheir courses the time of steady foot-ball practice. Captain Blanck and those<br />\nwho have the welfare of the team at heart are, of course, unwilling to have the<br />\nUniversity represented by light, inexperienced players, who would prove easy<br />\nmarks for our opponents. Mr Garwood, the coach for this year, is confident<br />\nthat he can produce the necessary men from the Medical School if some enthusiasm is shown on this side of town. And so the matter stands. The decision<br />\nof the Athletic Board will be announced this afternoon. If it is for the team, it<br />\nwill then be \"up to\" every student who has the slightest ability to get on his<br />\nfoot-ball clothes and attend practice regularly. Every effort will be needed, for<br />\nour honor will be at stake.<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\nHE prospect of a Hopkins athletic field is one that opens to our view every<br />\nfall, and disappears with the same regularity in the summer. But this<br />\nyear it really seems that something will be done, President Remsen, at<br />\nthe Freshmen reception, announced that the trustees had in mind the project<br />\nof using some part of the Homestead grounds as an athletic field, and that the'<br />\nmatter was being attended to as rapidly as circumstances permitted. Moreover,<br />\nthe report of ex-Treasurer Gillespie, of the Athletic Board, read at the election<br />\nby Mr. Abercrombie, showed that the prosperous lacrosse season last spring<br />\nhad added $780 to the $1173, which then constituted our athletic field fund, so<br />\nthat there is now in bank a balance of $1953 for this purpose. It seems more<br />\nthan possible th;it the lacrosse games next spring can be played on our own<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\ncampus.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE N EWS\u2014LETTE R,<br />\nT one of the gentle controversies with which Freshmen and Juniors have<br />\nrecently been delighting all beholders, some Seniors present called for a<br />\ncessation of hostilities, after matters had proceeded to a gory and dusty<br />\nclimax. Much to the surprise of all present, a few revolutionary spirits announced that it was their own affair, and that no interference was wanted, so<br />\nmuch so that a little physical suasion had to be applied until the rest of the<br />\ncombatants filed out. This attitude of the underclassmen is by no means a<br />\nnew one, but it is none the less thoroughly mistaken. Because the Senior's<br />\nparticipation in such affairs is no longer active, it does not follow that he is a<br />\n\"has-been,\" and should show no interest. It is his duty, no less than his inclination, to be on hand at all class troubles, and to be responsible for their<br />\nproper conducting. He has been through it all; he has sprawled in defeat, and<br />\ncrowed in triumph, and no one knows better when there has been enough. At<br />\na Northern college visited by the writer this fall, there was an unwritten law<br />\nthat no hazing should take place without the presence of an upperclassman.<br />\nThe principle illustrated is the right one. There should be no repetition of the<br />\nspectacle of Seniors exerting force to show their authority.<br />\nFOR THE UNDERGRADUATE.<br />\n.T the first meeting of the year of the Junior class, the following officers<br />\nwere elected: Thomas S. Strohbar, president; R. Gordon Dulaney, vicepresident; J. C. L. Hawkins, secretary; W. L. LeCron, treasurer; R.<br />\nS. Opie, historian; H. S. Evans, sergeant-at arms. For the football team, Sifford Pearre was chosen captain, and G. A. Foster manager. Two new members<br />\nof the class were elected: H. S. Evans, of Lehigh. and H. B. Heald, a former<br />\nstudent of the University. The Yell Committee is Licking, Crozier, and Foster.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nDr. J. S. Ames has decided that no more Freshmen will be permitted to<br />\nenter the class in Minor Physics. A large percentage of the students who have<br />\nfailed in this course during recent years have been Freshmen, and so it has<br />\nbeen arranged that those desiring to enter it must previously spend at least a<br />\nyear in the enlightening atmosphere of the University.<br />\nAndrew D. Jones. Jr., who had been absent from the University for several<br />\nyears, has returned to work for his bachelor's degree.<br />\nH. K.

A very good attendance<br />\nwas noted, and no particular incident marred the ballot. The result<br />\nwas as follows: Ronald T. Abercrombie, President; W. Sellman Bird, VicePresident; Joseph T. Smith, Corresponding Secretary; B. L. Pessagno, Recording Secretary; W. E. Hoffman, Treasurer; Dr. E. Renouf and Prof. Wm M.<br />\nMackdermott, Faculty atlegates; Dr B. B.

Tootle, for track and field work. \"H. A. A.\" was awarded Porter, LeCron, Emig and Branham.<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nTRACK AND FIELD.<br />\nAt such an early date, very little can be said regarding track and field<br />\nprospects for the coming year. Judging from numbers and appearances, however, Hopkins should be able to perform the same \"stunts\" at the local track<br />\nand field contests held during the winter and spring.<br />\nCaptain R. C. Hoffman called a meeting of candidates last week and 36<br />\nchesty men responded. The large majority were new men, but most of these<br />\nwere very prepossessing in appearance, and some good material should be<br />\ngotten out of their midst.<br />\nNext light work will begin consisting mainly in using the gymnasium apparatus and learning points about the all-important start. It will take hard<br />\nsystematie work to develop men to take the iplaces of such cracks as Riggs,<br />\nScholl, Lindsay and others, but \"Curzon \"is known as a conscientious hustler<br />\nand may be depended upon to \"get busy\" and keep it up<br />\n\"Bill \"Hoffman and \"Joe\" England are still beneath the Black and Blue<br />\non the other side of town and may be depended upon to help in every possible<br />\nway. Harvey Stone is also among the\"meds.\" Altogether the prospects in<br />\ntrack and field work are fairly good. It is not likely that a J. H\u2022 U. meet will<br />\nbe held before January, but something has already been said about a set of<br />\ngames between the Senior, Junior and Freshman classes. All sorts of events<br />\n<br />\n\fI<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nare proposed and the grand finale is to be a relay race to be crowed over in the<br />\ntrophy room each year by the victorious class. The idea seems to be a good<br />\none and it might be well for the classes to consider the matter.<br />\nFRESHMAN -JUNIOR FOOTBALL.<br />\nHE apparent lack of 'Varsity football material seems to have brought the<br />\n\u2022 candidates for the Junior and Freshman class teams into prominence. In<br />\nformer years very little has been done toward organizing class teams<br />\nuntil the end of the 'Varsity schedule. The fact that there may be no schedule<br />\nthis year probably accounts for such early action among the Juniors and the<br />\nFreshmen.

As a matter of fact, few tasks are more simple. The rub comes<br />\nafter the song is written, and the real work consists in making a popular song popular. There is only one way under the sun to do this and that is<br />\nto let people hear it.<br />\nI have received hundreds of letters reading about like this:<br />\n\"DEAR MR. HAVRZ-I have just completed a song and want you to tell me<br />\nhow to make it popular. It strikes me as possessing all the catchy features of<br />\nthe present day 'hits,' and I don't see why it shouldn't be a go, etc., etc.\"<br />\nMy invariable reply is, \"Get someone on the stage to sing it.\" This is the<br />\ntrue secret of making a song popular. Just about ninety per cent. of the hits<br />\nof today in the song field are the most inane things imaginable, and anybody<br />\nWho would prophecy success for any one of them before it was produced would<br />\nbe voted crazy by a jury of his fellows; but the fact remains that the most<br />\nmediocre song in the world, if pumped into the public ear night after night,<br />\nwill make some kind of a hit.<br />\nNowadays, publishers pay actresses, excuse the word, for singing their<br />\nsongs. About fifty soubrettes were warbling \"Dolly Gray\" for' a specified<br />\nsum per week. The result was it made a hit. \"I must a been Dreamin'\" was<br />\nanother that had to be pushed with money. Yet it scored heavily. Both these<br />\nsongs were purchased by the publisher in a bunch of fifty or more ditties<br />\nacquired by a firm that failed, which were afterwards disposed of for almost<br />\nnothing.<br />\n\"Annie Moore,\" that nightmare of harmony, lay in a publisher's safe about<br />\nfive years before he thought fit to put it out. \"Hello, my Baby,\" was hawked<br />\nabout to many New York ,publishers, all of whom refused it, saying that it was<br />\nrot. It was finally sold to one publisher for $5, and when he bought it he<br />\nthought he had been buncoed.<br />\nA stranger with a bundle of songs stands as much chance in New York<br />\namong the publishers as a book agent. He is put off, told to wait, asked to<br />\nCome in again, or told the manager is busy and can't see him. I have seen<br />\nmany a sad sight in the New York publishing houses. Composers with really<br />\ngood material, anxious to play their work to the publisher, wait in vain for an<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nOn one occasion I was sitting in the private office of a large publisher when<br />\nthe outer guard, if I may so call him, entered and said that there was a young<br />\nman outside with three songs to submit. \"Tell him I'm busy or I'm out or in<br />\nChicago, or anything,\" said the publisher, and turning to me, continued:<br /><br />\nTi<br /><br />\nse<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\"You have no idea of the manner in which I'm bothered by these people.<br />\nWhy if I listened to all their rot I wouldn't have time to attend to any part of<br />\nmy business.\"<br />\nMy mission being ended, I went into the outer office and saw a picture of woe. The man who had asked for the publisher had a bundle of badly<br />\nsoiled songs under his arm. and a woe-begone expression on his face. Notwithstanding the fact that there was a heavy snowfall, his shoes were so worn<br />\nthat his toes protruded. I took him into one of the palatial rooms near by,<br />\nand motioned him to the piano. He drew his hands from his trousers pockets<br />\nand tried to play, but his fingers were numb with the cold. I sent out for some<br />\nbrandy for him and under its influence he was soon able to use his fingers. He<br />\nthen played three excessively pretty songs, which I insisted on the publisher<br />\nhearing. The result was that all three songs were accepted; one of them is at<br />\nthe present time a distinct hit.<br />\nHow different it is with a man or a woman who has written a successful<br />\nsong! The moment a successful song writer walks into a publisher's office, he<br />\nis almost hugged. His slightest word is eagerly listened to, and every comment<br />\nhe makes is carefully taken note of. Everything is done to make him comfortable, and be feels a degree of elation that is remarkable. All this because<br />\nhe has written something in the popular vein, and the publisher wants another<br />\nmoney-maker from him.<br />\nIt is a senseless method of procedure to publish a song anywhere except in<br />\nNew York City. That is the home .of the actor and singer. and consequently<br />\nthe stronghold of the publisher. It is a thousand to one bet that a hit cannot<br />\nbe made of a song except when it is published in New York<br />\nLast, but not least, no publisher will take up a song that is in any degree<br />\ncomplicated or \"good.\" The music must be commonplace and the words even<br />\nmore so. The publisher says: ''The public want trash; why not give it to<br />\nJEAN C. HAVEZ.<br />\nthem ?\" And there you are.<br />\nA PLEA FOR SIMPLICITY IN DICTION.<br />\nOW often are we imposed upon by the clang of cymbals and the clash of<br />\nsounding brass! How often the very makers of this noise deceive themselves! Writers and speakers are often prone to swell their periods with<br />\nhigh-sounding words, merely for the sake of sound. Not only is this to be found<br />\nin the speeches of the curbstone orator and of the ranting preacher, but even<br />\nin higher intellectual strata. Charlatans are more numerous in literary fields<br />\nto-day than they ever were in the time of the original magician. We have dross '<br />\nshowered upon us. We are stormed at until our ear-drums protest against the<br />\nstrain.<br />\nThere are two great reasons for the existence of this empty fiuff ball style<br />\nof language. The first is a desire to dress up in tinsel; the second cause, and<br />\nprobably the most usual, is the lack of cogent, logical thought upon the subject<br />\nmatter.<br /><br />\ng<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nIt is not surprising that a student who has just made his acquaintance with<br />\na number of \"large\" words should be anxious to exercise his vocabulary to its<br />\nfull extent. In a debate in our halls, a \"senator\" relieved himself of the following sententious bundle of words which had been weighing upon his mind:<br />\nGentlemen, we postulate our position under the orderly march of cumulative<br />\nfacts.\" Having howled this out, his face beamed with conscious pride, and his<br />\nchest was strained to its utmost capacity.<br />\nNor is the undergraduate the only one who seeks to impress his audience.<br />\nA graduate student of several years standing perplexed a seminary meeting by<br />\nusing the term \"altruistic individualism.\" \"Subjective-objectivity\" was once<br />\nventured in a lecture room.<br />\nNor again have we reached the limit to which this sin pervades our halls of<br />\nlearning. I have heard even worthy instructors upon \"off days\" spin out the<br />\nthread of their discourse so thin that it was in imminent danger of being worn<br />\nout in the process.<br />\nUpon one occasion while taking notes in a lecture, my mind wandered, and<br />\nmy note taking became merely mechanical. Upon reading the note-book over,<br />\nI found one simple proposition stated in six different ways.<br />\nOnce upon a time a Spaniard, without any knowledge whatever of the Ung\u2022<br />\nlish language, attempted to translate with the aid of a bilingual dictionary the<br />\nClassics of his tongue into English. The result is most grotesque\u2014a conglomeration of words thrown higglity-pigglity upon the page, full of sound but<br />\nmeaningless.<br />\nThis poor Spaniard knew no better, and may be pardoned with a pitying<br />\nsmile, but for the deliberate villian who stones us with mere \"words, words,<br />\nwords,\" no fate is too hard.<br />\nSometimes the long-winded, gorgeous-hued language conveys ideas worth<br />\ngetting, but one is very apt to be so engrossed in examining the wax flowers as<br />\nto miss the meaning, disproportionate as it is to the sound and length of the<br />\nexpressing medium.<br />\nA famous lawyer, while addressing a jury, having used all the epithetics<br />\nin the dictionary, hesitated a moment, and then added, \"this naufrageons ruffian.\" He was afterwards asked what the word meant, and replied that he did<br />\nnot know, but \"he thought it sounded well.\"<br />\nThat is the raison d'etre of so many a speech; sound instead of sense. Now,<br />\nIn our \"hurry up\" day, we have not the time to waste upon mere sound.<br />\nThose who enjoy it had better take themselves to a \"boiler shop.\" The<br />\nSpeech abounding in \"glittering generalities,\" which states the proposition<br />\nthat 2+2-4 in language worthy of Cicero, is aptly described by the slang expression \"hot air.\"<br />\nTo escape the charge of \"hot airing\" myself, I will drop my pen before<br />\nexhibiting too many examples of the evil I have been abusing.<br />\nR.

THE NEws-LnTTER is the only<br />\nstudent periodical publication of the University. It has to combine, in greater<br />\nor less degree, the features of a news weekly, a literary monthly, and a comic<br />\npaper. In preparing and stirring up such a mixture, the editors have their<br />\ntroubles. The recompense they are looking to is your hearty support, not<br />\nonly with your subscriptions, but in no less degree with contributions of matter suitable for publication.<br />\nNext, to our critics. It is true that criticism is a salutary thing; the editors fully realize this, and are duly thankful for having been saved so often.<br />\nBut we cannot help thinking sometimes: If you are so solicitous about the<br />\nreputation of the paper, why don't you help to improve it? The little trouble<br />\nneeded to jot down and hand in the idea for an article, sketch, or poem, would<br />\nvery often bring about an attractive feature in the next number. And to those<br />\nfew,\u2014for there are a few,\u2014who confess to a lack of immediate interest in the<br />\npaper, we would say: Did you ever think that the THE NEWS-LETTER iS exchanged to most colleges of note in the United States and Canada, and that<br />\nfrom it many men in these colleges will get their idea of the quantity and<br />\nquality of spirit in our undergradnate life? If you have at heart, in the slightest degree, the reputation of the college, you will put some little effort into<br />\nhelping its official representative abroad.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nFinally, to our friends. The appearance of the sheet is changed somewhat,<br />\nand it is intended to have a different cover with each issue. The paper is circulating more widely among the alumni, and for this reason it is desired to enlarge the colutim of alumni news much as possible. In getting ideas and notes<br />\nin these departments, we ask for the same cordial co-operation that you have<br />\nshown us so often in the past.<br />\nWO places are open to candidates on the Board of Editors. One, for a '05<br />\nman, is the post of assistant athletic editor; the other, that of assistant<br />\nbusiness manager, which leads to the business managership next year,<br />\nand is, therefore, open to all Juniors, For information about the work to be<br />\ndone in getting these places, apply to any of the board.<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nHE question of the existence of a 1902 foot-ball team is the first that will<br />\noccupy the attention of the newly elected Athletic Board. Since 1897,<br />\nthe University has had a team each season, and it has always been well<br />\nsupported and creditable. This year, however, the prospect is very doubtful.<br />\nThere are not more than half a dozen men in the undergraduate department<br />\nwho are up to the standard of a Hopkins team, and some difficulty has been experienced in making up the number at the medical school. It would seem that<br />\namong our entering class of 101, from colleges in every part of the States, a few<br />\nenthusiasts could be found. But the change in the schedule of the first-year work<br />\nis keeping the class so busy that even the most enthusiastic dread to lose from<br />\ntheir courses the time of steady foot-ball practice. Captain Blanck and those<br />\nwho have the welfare of the team at heart are, of course, unwilling to have the<br />\nUniversity represented by light, inexperienced players, who would prove easy<br />\nmarks for our opponents. Mr Garwood, the coach for this year, is confident<br />\nthat he can produce the necessary men from the Medical School if some enthusiasm is shown on this side of town. And so the matter stands. The decision<br />\nof the Athletic Board will be announced this afternoon. If it is for the team, it<br />\nwill then be \"up to\" every student who has the slightest ability to get on his<br />\nfoot-ball clothes and attend practice regularly. Every effort will be needed, for<br />\nour honor will be at stake.<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nHE prospect of a Hopkins athletic field is one that opens to our view every<br />\nfall, and disappears with the same regularity in the summer. But this<br />\nyear it really seems that something will be done, President Remsen, at<br />\nthe Freshmen reception, announced that the trustees had in mind the project<br />\nof using some part of the Homestead grounds as an athletic field, and that the'<br />\nmatter was being attended to as rapidly as circumstances permitted. Moreover,<br />\nthe report of ex-Treasurer Gillespie, of the Athletic Board, read at the election<br />\nby Mr. Abercrombie, showed that the prosperous lacrosse season last spring<br />\nhad added $780 to the $1173, which then constituted our athletic field fund, so<br />\nthat there is now in bank a balance of $1953 for this purpose. It seems more<br />\nthan possible th;it the lacrosse games next spring can be played on our own<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\ncampus.<br /><br />\nTHE N EWS\u2014LETTE R,<br />\nT one of the gentle controversies with which Freshmen and Juniors have<br />\nrecently been delighting all beholders, some Seniors present called for a<br />\ncessation of hostilities, after matters had proceeded to a gory and dusty<br />\nclimax. Much to the surprise of all present, a few revolutionary spirits announced that it was their own affair, and that no interference was wanted, so<br />\nmuch so that a little physical suasion had to be applied until the rest of the<br />\ncombatants filed out. This attitude of the underclassmen is by no means a<br />\nnew one, but it is none the less thoroughly mistaken. Because the Senior's<br />\nparticipation in such affairs is no longer active, it does not follow that he is a<br />\n\"has-been,\" and should show no interest. It is his duty, no less than his inclination, to be on hand at all class troubles, and to be responsible for their<br />\nproper conducting. He has been through it all; he has sprawled in defeat, and<br />\ncrowed in triumph, and no one knows better when there has been enough. At<br />\na Northern college visited by the writer this fall, there was an unwritten law<br />\nthat no hazing should take place without the presence of an upperclassman.<br />\nThe principle illustrated is the right one. There should be no repetition of the<br />\nspectacle of Seniors exerting force to show their authority.<br />\nFOR THE UNDERGRADUATE.<br />\n.T the first meeting of the year of the Junior class, the following officers<br />\nwere elected: Thomas S. Strohbar, president; R. Gordon Dulaney, vicepresident; J. C. L. Hawkins, secretary; W. L. LeCron, treasurer; R.<br />\nS. Opie, historian; H. S. Evans, sergeant-at arms. For the football team, Sifford Pearre was chosen captain, and G. A. Foster manager. Two new members<br />\nof the class were elected: H. S. Evans, of Lehigh. and H. B. Heald, a former<br />\nstudent of the University. The Yell Committee is Licking, Crozier, and Foster.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nDr. J. S. Ames has decided that no more Freshmen will be permitted to<br />\nenter the class in Minor Physics. A large percentage of the students who have<br />\nfailed in this course during recent years have been Freshmen, and so it has<br />\nbeen arranged that those desiring to enter it must previously spend at least a<br />\nyear in the enlightening atmosphere of the University.<br />\nAndrew D.

A very good attendance<br />\nwas noted, and no particular incident marred the ballot. The result<br />\nwas as follows: Ronald T. Abercrombie, President; W. Sellman Bird, VicePresident; Joseph T. Smith, Corresponding Secretary; B. L. Pessagno, Recording Secretary; W. E. Hoffman, Treasurer; Dr. E. Renouf and Prof. Wm M.<br />\nMackdermott, Faculty atlegates; Dr B. B.

Judging from numbers and appearances, however, Hopkins should be able to perform the same \"stunts\" at the local track<br />\nand field contests held during the winter and spring.<br />\nCaptain R. C. Hoffman called a meeting of candidates last week and 36<br />\nchesty men responded. The large majority were new men, but most of these<br />\nwere very prepossessing in appearance, and some good material should be<br />\ngotten out of their midst.<br />\nNext light work will begin consisting mainly in using the gymnasium apparatus and learning points about the all-important start. It will take hard<br />\nsystematie work to develop men to take the iplaces of such cracks as Riggs,<br />\nScholl, Lindsay and others, but \"Curzon \"is known as a conscientious hustler<br />\nand may be depended upon to \"get busy\" and keep it up<br />\n\"Bill \"Hoffman and \"Joe\" England are still beneath the Black and Blue<br />\non the other side of town and may be depended upon to help in every possible<br />\nway. Harvey Stone is also among the\"meds.\" Altogether the prospects in<br />\ntrack and field work are fairly good. It is not likely that a J. H\u2022 U. meet will<br />\nbe held before January, but something has already been said about a set of<br />\ngames between the Senior, Junior and Freshman classes. All sorts of events<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nare proposed and the grand finale is to be a relay race to be crowed over in the<br />\ntrophy room each year by the victorious class.

In<br />\nformer years very little has been done toward organizing class teams<br />\nuntil the end of the 'Varsity schedule. The fact that there may be no schedule<br />\nthis year probably accounts for such early action among the Juniors and the<br />\nFreshmen.
