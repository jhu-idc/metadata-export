The result of that game, however; is a<br />\ngood thing for our University. It means that larger crowds than ever<br />\nbefore will flock to Homewood Field to witness the Hopkins-Navy<br />\ncontest and the Hopkins-Maryland game the following week. On<br />\nboth occasions, Hopkins must show her best. We feel confident that<br />\nthe team will give all they have. It remains for the student body to<br />\nfill the cheering section and show their support. Last Saturday, an<br />\nofficial count showed ninety-seven men in the cheering squad out of<br />\na student body of six hundred and thirty-five and eleven men and a<br />\nleader in the Band out of a membership of forty-four.

The result of that game, however; is a<br />\ngood thing for our University. It means that larger crowds than ever<br />\nbefore will flock to Homewood Field to witness the Hopkins-Navy<br />\ncontest and the Hopkins-Maryland game the following week. On<br />\nboth occasions, Hopkins must show her best. We feel confident that<br />\nthe team will give all they have. It remains for the student body to<br />\nfill the cheering section and show their support. Last Saturday, an<br />\nofficial count showed ninety-seven men in the cheering squad out of<br />\na student body of six hundred and thirty-five and eleven men and a<br />\nleader in the Band out of a membership of forty-four.
