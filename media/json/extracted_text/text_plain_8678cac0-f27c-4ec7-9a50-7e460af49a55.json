With Hopkins' tuition at $2,700 next<br />\nSeptember (and Dr. Gordon has already predicted<br />\nfuture hikes) it is becoming increasingly more difficult<br />\nto pretend that private schooling is open to every<br />\nqualified student regardless of his ability to pay.<br />\nReports have circulated from such sources as<br />\nDirector of Financial Aid Robert Kaufman that<br />\nfreshmen scholarships may be sliced 50 per cent next<br />\nyear. Coupled with the growing strength of public<br />\nuniversities and colleges, private education will soon be<br />\nhard-pressed to compete with state institutions and still<br />\nstay financially alive.<br />\nIn the face of this Yale University is considering a<br />\nbold plan. It would allow students to take up to 35 years<br />\nto pay their tuition. Specifically, students would pay 0.4<br />\nper cent of their future income for every $1,000 in tuition<br />\ndeferred, beginning when they leave school and<br />\ncontinuing for a maximum of 35 years.<br />\nA Yale official said, \"The purpose of the plan is to<br />\nenable the university to charge somewhat higher tuition<br />\nwithout creating such a burden on a student from a<br />\nfamily with a low or middle income that he would not be<br />\nable to come. This plan enables everyone to pay a higher<br />\ncharge even though the family can't really afford it.\"<br />\nFor years Hopkins has had a policy of admitting<br />\nstudents without regard to financial need. Now on the<br />\nroad to admitting only those who can pay and thus<br />\njeopardizing a diversified student body, the University<br />\nmust find a way to turn around. Yale's plan, we believe,<br />\nmay provide the means.<br />\nUnder the Yale proposal, the student would be<br />\ngrouped with all those who began making payments in<br />\nthe same year. When a group had paid off its total debt,<br />\nall of its members would be freed of their obligation. A<br />\nstudent could get out of the plan at any time by paying<br />\n150 per cent of the amount deferred plus interest.<br />\nIf the plan receives final approval, Yale would stand<br />\nto get a return of five per cent on a sizeable investment<br />\nestimated at $25-30 million for the first five years. The<br />\nadvantages to the University, however, and particularly<br />\nto students, are multi-fold. First, it would insure<br />\nmaintenance of a diversified student body. Second,<br />\nstudents paying their own way would have increased<br />\nincentives to press for educational improvements.<br />\nAs an interim step to weather the current inflationary<br />\ncycle in a more equitable manner, we would urge the<br />\nUniversity to implement a \"guaranteed tuition policy.\"<br />\nUnder such a policy, the University would forfeit its<br />\nright to arbitrarily raise tuition and guarantee that the<br />\ntuition a student pays his first year will be the same that<br />\nhe pays his last. When this year's senior class entered<br />\nHopkins, tuition was $2,000. Each member of that class<br />\nhas coughed up $750 more than he originally anticipated.<br />\nThe junior class picture is even bleaker. By the time<br />\ngraduation rolls around, they will have paid a whopping<br />\n$1,450 more than the catalogue told them it would cost at<br />\nthe time they applied.<br />\nBearing in mind that many students and their families<br />\nare just as financially hard-pressed as the University,<br />\nwe urge the Student Council, the Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization, the faculty and the administration to get<br />\nbehind the plan for guaranteed tuition.<br />\nTo ease its own burdens the University could<br />\nundertake the difficult job of predicting economic costs<br />\nover a four-year span as best it can,setting a price tag in<br />\nline with these costs for each entering class, and then<br />\nsticking with it. Then, at least, students and parents<br />\nwould know what they were getting into.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nFOOTBALL DEFENSE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI must take quick and<br />\ndetermined exception to your<br />\nbrief editorial of January 29<br />\nin which you advocate the<br />\nelimination of football at<br />\nHopkins because it is a<br />\n\"business\", because it is \"no<br />\nlonger a sport\", because it is<br />\na \"mediocre program\", and<br />\nbecause it is \"of benefit only<br />\nto a few\".<br />\nSince your editorial began<br />\nwith a reference to the recent<br />\ndrafting of a high caliber<br />\nfootball player by the Boston<br />\nPatriots, I would infer, as all<br />\ntoo many do, that the<br />\nNational Football League is<br />\nthe standard by which the<br />\nJohns Hopkins football<br />\nprogram, and all football<br />\nprograms, should be judged.<br />\nYou couldn't be more wrong.<br />\nWe play \"small college<br />\nfootball\" and are proud to do<br />\nso. There is absolutely<br />\nnothing wrong with it if it is<br />\njudged by small college<br />\nstandards instead of NFL<br />\nstandards. For Hopkins, and<br />\nfor all small college football<br />\nteams, it is NOT a business, it<br />\nis a sport,(where, contrary to<br />\nyour opinion, individual<br />\ndevelopment does take place.)<br />\nAt Hopkins it is NOT<br />\nour<br />\nmediocre<br />\n(count<br />\nchampionships over the last<br />\ntwelve years compared to<br />\nothers in our conference). At<br />\nHopkins it does NOT benefit a<br />\nfew (we have had more<br />\nstudents playing football than<br />\nany other sport over the last<br />\ntwelve years).<br />\nFootball has made a fine<br />\n<br />\ncontribution to Hopkins over<br />\nthe years, and to our students<br />\nwho have played it. I think<br />\nmost of those who have<br />\nplayed have done so with the<br />\nidea of enjoying a good sport<br />\nwith a good bunch of guys. I<br />\ndoubt if any of them will say<br />\nour football program has<br />\nfailed because we haven't yet<br />\nproduced the number one<br />\ndraft choice for the NFL.<br />\nI sincerely hope football<br />\ncan have another 90 years of<br />\nvalue and service to Hopkins.<br />\nBut I hope even more, if it is<br />\nour<br />\nfrom<br />\neliminated<br />\nprogram, that it won't be<br />\nbecause the standards you<br />\nare using to judge our<br />\nprogram are allowed to<br />\nprevail.<br />\nMarshall S. Turner, Jr.<br />\nDirector of Athletics<br />\nGORDON -- RESIGN<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFirst it was tuition<br />\nincreases, then increases in<br />\nthe total undergraduate<br />\nenrollment; next came<br />\ncutbacks in the total number<br />\nof courses being taught with<br />\nthe complete elimination of<br />\nthe Chemical Engineering<br />\nDepartment and then the<br />\nEducation and Russian<br />\nDepartments (God knows,<br />\nwhat will be next!).<br />\nNow we are told that there<br />\nwill be an elimination of ten<br />\nper cent of the faculty -- we all<br />\nknow that there are too many<br />\ncourses being taught to<br />\nthe<br />\nundergraduates at<br />\npresent time. Just ask the<br />\nEnglish Department (Right<br />\nDr. Miller!).<br />\n<br />\nFoundation grants are<br />\nclosing up and government<br />\nspending for higher education<br />\nhas been greatly reduced...<br />\nin<br />\nBut<br />\ncutbacks<br />\ngovernment grants are<br />\nmerely an excuse, a facade<br />\nwhich the administrators at<br />\nthe University are putting up<br />\nto substantiate their own<br />\nineptness. The lines of central<br />\nauthority were beginning to<br />\nbreak down at the time of my<br />\ngraduation in June 1969 and<br />\nthey have reached the crisis<br />\nstate now that Dr. Bevan has<br />\nleft.<br />\nHopkins appears to be<br />\nheading for its final demise,<br />\nback into being a parochial,<br />\nfour year college designed to<br />\ntrain doctors and lacrosse<br />\nplayers. The only way it<br />\nmight be saved at this time,<br />\nand there is grave doubt in my<br />\nmy mind whether there is<br />\nstill hope, is for Board of<br />\nTrustees to ask for Lincoln<br />\nGordon's resignation.<br />\nHe has proved himself<br />\nunable to cope with the<br />\nstudent body and the faculty<br />\nin these troubled times, and<br />\nhe has failed miserably in his<br />\nmajor task of raising money<br />\nfor the University. I might<br />\nhope that he would volunteer<br />\nto resign for the good of this<br />\nschool.<br />\nDennis A. Estis<br />\nClass of 1969<br />\nEds.'

H.<br />\nHarvey, President of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.<br />\n<br />\nFraternities<br />\n<br />\nIn the Wind<br />\nGeorge Rosanelli<br />\nFor the past few years there has been a<br />\nnationwide trend among the youth for selfexpression, individualism and personal<br />\nfreedom. Any kind of a structured society<br />\nhas been condemned as an obstruction to this<br />\nnewly-popular philosophy.<br />\nOne manifestation of this movement has<br />\nbeen a decline, on the national scale, of the<br />\ncollege fraternity system. Here at the<br />\nHomewood campus we have seen the<br />\nnumber of fraternities drop from fifteeen<br />\nfour years ago to ten this year....<br />\nThe reduction of fraternities at Homewood<br />\nstemmed from a lack of interest. This<br />\nresulted in members leaving the fraternity<br />\nand, finally, for financial reasons, the<br />\nfraternity went under.<br />\nThe lack of interest, however, did not come<br />\nfrom any personal condmenation of the<br />\nsystem, but because fraternities were either<br />\nnot providing the services that the member<br />\nwanted, or he had found other ways of<br />\ngetting these services...<br />\nBack in my freshman year, fraternities<br />\nwere very \"rah rah\"....<br />\nSince then, the fraternity system has<br />\nchanged at Hopkins. Those fraternities that<br />\ndid not want to bend in the wind have folded.<br />\nWhat we are left with today is a core of ten<br />\nstrong fraternities, providing needed and<br />\nvarious services to their members. These<br />\nfraternities are not anachronisms, by any<br />\nmeans. Bear in mind that the word<br />\nGeorge Rosarzelli is President of the Inter-Fraternity Council. Fraternity rush begins this week.<br />\n<br />\n\"fraternity\" in the present context more<br />\nclosely evokes a commune, than the 1930's<br />\nconcept of beer, broads, and sports.<br />\nThis, of course, brings us to the question-what exactly do the present fraternities have<br />\nto offer? To be frank, they are means of<br />\nenhancing your social life.<br />\nTo be a brother means different things in<br />\ndifferent fraternities, but even taking its<br />\nleast intimate meaning it widens your circle<br />\nof friends and introduces you to men from<br />\nother classes. The fraternity provides a<br />\ncentral location, the house, where you can<br />\nget away from the campus into a club-like<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nIt also provides activities which many of<br />\nyou already know can be prohibitively<br />\nexpensive to find on your own. Along with the<br />\nsocial schedule of the individual fraternity,<br />\nyou can take part in the boat-rides and<br />\nformals sponsored by the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nAll these things come in varying degrees in<br />\ndifferent fraternities. No two fraternities are<br />\nidentical.<br />\nThe groups have gradients in regard to<br />\nhow closely-knit they are, as well as quality<br />\nof physical facilities, social schedule, and,<br />\nalso important, costs. There may be other<br />\nintangibles that you consider important<br />\nother than the ones above, but the choice is<br />\nthere.<br />\nIt is not uncommon for a man to join, and<br />\nbe happy in, a fraternity just because his<br />\nfriends are in it; perhaps this should be the<br />\nonly criterion in choosing.

Just how<br />\nunsuccessful it was can be seen from<br />\nthe fact that these plants are taken<br />\ntoday, throughout the Indian<br />\ncountry, iri ceremonials invoking the<br />\nvery name of the Virgin Mary, of the<br />\nSaints, of our Lord, much to the<br />\nhorror of visiting priests, especially<br />\nwhen they discover the local priest<br />\nchanting around the fire in the ageold rite, high as a kite on peyote like<br />\nthe rest of the peasants.<br />\nThere are many other magic<br />\nplants in Mexico, and most of them<br />\nseem to occupy a religious niche in<br />\nthe lives of the natives.

The fact is that these people<br />\nhave been consciously altering their<br />\nstate of mind from the time they<br />\ndiscovered that eating certain little<br />\nmushrooms or leaves would cause<br />\nthem to see and feel things<br />\nunimaginable previously, and such<br />\necstasy can only come from a God,<br />\n<br />\nright?

The book is largely filled<br />\nwith mediocre photographs and<br />\nsoggy attempts at political fervor. It<br />\nIs also subliterate. As its editor,<br />\nretired radical John Adams so aptly<br />\nremarked, \"The emphasis is on<br />\nviable.\"<br />\nThe yearbook traditionally has<br />\nangered the unlucky students who<br />\npurchase it, because it was either<br />\ntoo \"arty\" or too dull. This year's<br />\norange-covered marvel, however,<br />\ncombines both unpleasant features,<br />\nalong with old fashioned inaccuracy,<br />\n<br />\nso as to make it a valuable addition<br />\nto any wastebasket.<br />\nMost of the book consists of illfocused shots of Hopkins students<br />\nprotesting injustic, war, and other<br />\nbad things. Adams cleverly led off<br />\nwith a photo of himself engaging in<br />\n\"meaningful dialogue\" with a<br />\nconfused Marine. The book, in fact,<br />\nappears to be a personal scrapbook<br />\nfor Adams, who played a leading<br />\nrole in last year's protests. Old<br />\nfriends like Tim Stocks are given<br />\ntwo fuzzy pages of photos, and most<br />\nof the Moratorium and strike photos<br />\nwill undoubtedly wring tearful sighs<br />\nof nostalgia from all of us.<br />\nThe yearbook surprises the<br />\nunwary reader by occasionally<br />\nthrowing in a tasteful or beautiful<br />\nphotograph. Certain professors,<br />\n<br />\nsome pretty girls, and a few nature<br />\nshots are delightful to look at.<br />\nUnfortunately, the yearbook staff<br />\nlost the photos of some groups,<br />\nforcing us to just look at drawings<br />\nand pretend. '<br />\nAlso, Adams has a fetish for<br />\nempty classrooms. Sprinkled<br />\nthroughout are crazy angles of<br />\nnothing but empty lecture halls. It's<br />\nso...alienated...with the empty<br />\nsilences of wooden desks. Get it? We<br />\nreceive a meaningless education,<br />\nsee, and so like nobody goes to<br />\nlecture, see, and like when<br />\nprofessors talk, see, it don't mean<br />\nanything...<br />\nAt the end, Adams writes, \"If we<br />\nhave failed, the responsibility rests<br />\nwith the Editor alone.\" Fortunately<br />\nfor him, he has already graduated.<br />\n<br />\nJames Joyce<br />\n2 February, 1882<br />\n'A king off duty and a jaw forever!'<br />\n<br />\nfeiffer<br />\nixecivNAtigroaR 4wocroe-.1<br />\n<br />\ngEpts-netourc -MC<br />\nNOME t,<br />\n<br />\nOVERTLIRoW TH EI,FARC<br />\n,I)F.E.AuckAcLo<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\nC1E4 LIP rRe,<br />\n<br />\nologodyNr.,<br />\n<br />\n417*\u2022IPPS<br />\nCatiM3<br />\n<br />\ntt1:1<br />\n<br />\ncc.<br />\n<br />\n1?Ei/ouirioN<br />\n<br />\nAU<br />\n<br />\nPoweR<br />\n<br />\ntO<br />\n<br />\nTH6 P6OPIE<br />\n<br />\nRIGHT ON<br />\n<br />\nMAUI((ZO. lk) VXT<br />\nSPE1 0 FORE76k) R2,ICY<br />\nWl1,1_ 20 MV IMPPESSION<br />\n6AMDtii.<br />\n<br />\n4(1<br />\n1/4<br />\nst.

With Hopkins' tuition at $2,700 next<br />\nSeptember (and Dr. Gordon has already predicted<br />\nfuture hikes) it is becoming increasingly more difficult<br />\nto pretend that private schooling is open to every<br />\nqualified student regardless of his ability to pay.<br />\nReports have circulated from such sources as<br />\nDirector of Financial Aid Robert Kaufman that<br />\nfreshmen scholarships may be sliced 50 per cent next<br />\nyear. Coupled with the growing strength of public<br />\nuniversities and colleges, private education will soon be<br />\nhard-pressed to compete with state institutions and still<br />\nstay financially alive.<br />\nIn the face of this Yale University is considering a<br />\nbold plan. It would allow students to take up to 35 years<br />\nto pay their tuition. Specifically, students would pay 0.4<br />\nper cent of their future income for every $1,000 in tuition<br />\ndeferred, beginning when they leave school and<br />\ncontinuing for a maximum of 35 years.<br />\nA Yale official said, \"The purpose of the plan is to<br />\nenable the university to charge somewhat higher tuition<br />\nwithout creating such a burden on a student from a<br />\nfamily with a low or middle income that he would not be<br />\nable to come. This plan enables everyone to pay a higher<br />\ncharge even though the family can't really afford it.\"<br />\nFor years Hopkins has had a policy of admitting<br />\nstudents without regard to financial need. Now on the<br />\nroad to admitting only those who can pay and thus<br />\njeopardizing a diversified student body, the University<br />\nmust find a way to turn around. Yale's plan, we believe,<br />\nmay provide the means.<br />\nUnder the Yale proposal, the student would be<br />\ngrouped with all those who began making payments in<br />\nthe same year. When a group had paid off its total debt,<br />\nall of its members would be freed of their obligation. A<br />\nstudent could get out of the plan at any time by paying<br />\n150 per cent of the amount deferred plus interest.<br />\nIf the plan receives final approval, Yale would stand<br />\nto get a return of five per cent on a sizeable investment<br />\nestimated at $25-30 million for the first five years. The<br />\nadvantages to the University, however, and particularly<br />\nto students, are multi-fold. First, it would insure<br />\nmaintenance of a diversified student body. Second,<br />\nstudents paying their own way would have increased<br />\nincentives to press for educational improvements.<br />\nAs an interim step to weather the current inflationary<br />\ncycle in a more equitable manner, we would urge the<br />\nUniversity to implement a \"guaranteed tuition policy.\"<br />\nUnder such a policy, the University would forfeit its<br />\nright to arbitrarily raise tuition and guarantee that the<br />\ntuition a student pays his first year will be the same that<br />\nhe pays his last. When this year's senior class entered<br />\nHopkins, tuition was $2,000. Each member of that class<br />\nhas coughed up $750 more than he originally anticipated.<br />\nThe junior class picture is even bleaker. By the time<br />\ngraduation rolls around, they will have paid a whopping<br />\n$1,450 more than the catalogue told them it would cost at<br />\nthe time they applied.<br />\nBearing in mind that many students and their families<br />\nare just as financially hard-pressed as the University,<br />\nwe urge the Student Council, the Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization, the faculty and the administration to get<br />\nbehind the plan for guaranteed tuition.<br />\nTo ease its own burdens the University could<br />\nundertake the difficult job of predicting economic costs<br />\nover a four-year span as best it can,setting a price tag in<br />\nline with these costs for each entering class, and then<br />\nsticking with it. Then, at least, students and parents<br />\nwould know what they were getting into.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nFOOTBALL DEFENSE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI must take quick and<br />\ndetermined exception to your<br />\nbrief editorial of January 29<br />\nin which you advocate the<br />\nelimination of football at<br />\nHopkins because it is a<br />\n\"business\", because it is \"no<br />\nlonger a sport\", because it is<br />\na \"mediocre program\", and<br />\nbecause it is \"of benefit only<br />\nto a few\".<br />\nSince your editorial began<br />\nwith a reference to the recent<br />\ndrafting of a high caliber<br />\nfootball player by the Boston<br />\nPatriots, I would infer, as all<br />\ntoo many do, that the<br />\nNational Football League is<br />\nthe standard by which the<br />\nJohns Hopkins football<br />\nprogram, and all football<br />\nprograms, should be judged.<br />\nYou couldn't be more wrong.<br />\nWe play \"small college<br />\nfootball\" and are proud to do<br />\nso. There is absolutely<br />\nnothing wrong with it if it is<br />\njudged by small college<br />\nstandards instead of NFL<br />\nstandards. For Hopkins, and<br />\nfor all small college football<br />\nteams, it is NOT a business, it<br />\nis a sport,(where, contrary to<br />\nyour opinion, individual<br />\ndevelopment does take place.)<br />\nAt Hopkins it is NOT<br />\nour<br />\nmediocre<br />\n(count<br />\nchampionships over the last<br />\ntwelve years compared to<br />\nothers in our conference). At<br />\nHopkins it does NOT benefit a<br />\nfew (we have had more<br />\nstudents playing football than<br />\nany other sport over the last<br />\ntwelve years).<br />\nFootball has made a fine<br /><br />\ncontribution to Hopkins over<br />\nthe years, and to our students<br />\nwho have played it. I think<br />\nmost of those who have<br />\nplayed have done so with the<br />\nidea of enjoying a good sport<br />\nwith a good bunch of guys. I<br />\ndoubt if any of them will say<br />\nour football program has<br />\nfailed because we haven't yet<br />\nproduced the number one<br />\ndraft choice for the NFL.<br />\nI sincerely hope football<br />\ncan have another 90 years of<br />\nvalue and service to Hopkins.<br />\nBut I hope even more, if it is<br />\nour<br />\nfrom<br />\neliminated<br />\nprogram, that it won't be<br />\nbecause the standards you<br />\nare using to judge our<br />\nprogram are allowed to<br />\nprevail.<br />\nMarshall S. Turner, Jr.<br />\nDirector of Athletics<br />\nGORDON -- RESIGN<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFirst it was tuition<br />\nincreases, then increases in<br />\nthe total undergraduate<br />\nenrollment; next came<br />\ncutbacks in the total number<br />\nof courses being taught with<br />\nthe complete elimination of<br />\nthe Chemical Engineering<br />\nDepartment and then the<br />\nEducation and Russian<br />\nDepartments (God knows,<br />\nwhat will be next!).<br />\nNow we are told that there<br />\nwill be an elimination of ten<br />\nper cent of the faculty -- we all<br />\nknow that there are too many<br />\ncourses being taught to<br />\nthe<br />\nundergraduates at<br />\npresent time. Just ask the<br />\nEnglish Department (Right<br />\nDr. Miller!).<br /><br />\nFoundation grants are<br />\nclosing up and government<br />\nspending for higher education<br />\nhas been greatly reduced...<br />\nin<br />\nBut<br />\ncutbacks<br />\ngovernment grants are<br />\nmerely an excuse, a facade<br />\nwhich the administrators at<br />\nthe University are putting up<br />\nto substantiate their own<br />\nineptness. The lines of central<br />\nauthority were beginning to<br />\nbreak down at the time of my<br />\ngraduation in June 1969 and<br />\nthey have reached the crisis<br />\nstate now that Dr. Bevan has<br />\nleft.<br />\nHopkins appears to be<br />\nheading for its final demise,<br />\nback into being a parochial,<br />\nfour year college designed to<br />\ntrain doctors and lacrosse<br />\nplayers. The only way it<br />\nmight be saved at this time,<br />\nand there is grave doubt in my<br />\nmy mind whether there is<br />\nstill hope, is for Board of<br />\nTrustees to ask for Lincoln<br />\nGordon's resignation.<br />\nHe has proved himself<br />\nunable to cope with the<br />\nstudent body and the faculty<br />\nin these troubled times, and<br />\nhe has failed miserably in his<br />\nmajor task of raising money<br />\nfor the University. I might<br />\nhope that he would volunteer<br />\nto resign for the good of this<br />\nschool.<br />\nDennis A. Estis<br />\nClass of 1969<br />\nEds.'

H.<br />\nHarvey, President of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.<br /><br />\nFraternities<br /><br />\nIn the Wind<br />\nGeorge Rosanelli<br />\nFor the past few years there has been a<br />\nnationwide trend among the youth for selfexpression, individualism and personal<br />\nfreedom. Any kind of a structured society<br />\nhas been condemned as an obstruction to this<br />\nnewly-popular philosophy.<br />\nOne manifestation of this movement has<br />\nbeen a decline, on the national scale, of the<br />\ncollege fraternity system. Here at the<br />\nHomewood campus we have seen the<br />\nnumber of fraternities drop from fifteeen<br />\nfour years ago to ten this year....<br />\nThe reduction of fraternities at Homewood<br />\nstemmed from a lack of interest. This<br />\nresulted in members leaving the fraternity<br />\nand, finally, for financial reasons, the<br />\nfraternity went under.<br />\nThe lack of interest, however, did not come<br />\nfrom any personal condmenation of the<br />\nsystem, but because fraternities were either<br />\nnot providing the services that the member<br />\nwanted, or he had found other ways of<br />\ngetting these services...<br />\nBack in my freshman year, fraternities<br />\nwere very \"rah rah\"....<br />\nSince then, the fraternity system has<br />\nchanged at Hopkins. Those fraternities that<br />\ndid not want to bend in the wind have folded.<br />\nWhat we are left with today is a core of ten<br />\nstrong fraternities, providing needed and<br />\nvarious services to their members. These<br />\nfraternities are not anachronisms, by any<br />\nmeans. Bear in mind that the word<br />\nGeorge Rosarzelli is President of the Inter-Fraternity Council. Fraternity rush begins this week.<br /><br />\n\"fraternity\" in the present context more<br />\nclosely evokes a commune, than the 1930's<br />\nconcept of beer, broads, and sports.<br />\nThis, of course, brings us to the question-what exactly do the present fraternities have<br />\nto offer? To be frank, they are means of<br />\nenhancing your social life.<br />\nTo be a brother means different things in<br />\ndifferent fraternities, but even taking its<br />\nleast intimate meaning it widens your circle<br />\nof friends and introduces you to men from<br />\nother classes. The fraternity provides a<br />\ncentral location, the house, where you can<br />\nget away from the campus into a club-like<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nIt also provides activities which many of<br />\nyou already know can be prohibitively<br />\nexpensive to find on your own. Along with the<br />\nsocial schedule of the individual fraternity,<br />\nyou can take part in the boat-rides and<br />\nformals sponsored by the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nAll these things come in varying degrees in<br />\ndifferent fraternities. No two fraternities are<br />\nidentical.<br />\nThe groups have gradients in regard to<br />\nhow closely-knit they are, as well as quality<br />\nof physical facilities, social schedule, and,<br />\nalso important, costs. There may be other<br />\nintangibles that you consider important<br />\nother than the ones above, but the choice is<br />\nthere.<br />\nIt is not uncommon for a man to join, and<br />\nbe happy in, a fraternity just because his<br />\nfriends are in it; perhaps this should be the<br />\nonly criterion in choosing.

Just how<br />\nunsuccessful it was can be seen from<br />\nthe fact that these plants are taken<br />\ntoday, throughout the Indian<br />\ncountry, iri ceremonials invoking the<br />\nvery name of the Virgin Mary, of the<br />\nSaints, of our Lord, much to the<br />\nhorror of visiting priests, especially<br />\nwhen they discover the local priest<br />\nchanting around the fire in the ageold rite, high as a kite on peyote like<br />\nthe rest of the peasants.<br />\nThere are many other magic<br />\nplants in Mexico, and most of them<br />\nseem to occupy a religious niche in<br />\nthe lives of the natives.

The fact is that these people<br />\nhave been consciously altering their<br />\nstate of mind from the time they<br />\ndiscovered that eating certain little<br />\nmushrooms or leaves would cause<br />\nthem to see and feel things<br />\nunimaginable previously, and such<br />\necstasy can only come from a God,<br /><br />\nright? After all, who provides all the<br />\nother good things in life? And The<br />\nArchetype of the witch-doctor the '<br />\npriest of.

The book is largely filled<br />\nwith mediocre photographs and<br />\nsoggy attempts at political fervor. It<br />\nIs also subliterate. As its editor,<br />\nretired radical John Adams so aptly<br />\nremarked, \"The emphasis is on<br />\nviable.\"<br />\nThe yearbook traditionally has<br />\nangered the unlucky students who<br />\npurchase it, because it was either<br />\ntoo \"arty\" or too dull. This year's<br />\norange-covered marvel, however,<br />\ncombines both unpleasant features,<br />\nalong with old fashioned inaccuracy,<br /><br />\nso as to make it a valuable addition<br />\nto any wastebasket.<br />\nMost of the book consists of illfocused shots of Hopkins students<br />\nprotesting injustic, war, and other<br />\nbad things. Adams cleverly led off<br />\nwith a photo of himself engaging in<br />\n\"meaningful dialogue\" with a<br />\nconfused Marine. The book, in fact,<br />\nappears to be a personal scrapbook<br />\nfor Adams, who played a leading<br />\nrole in last year's protests. Old<br />\nfriends like Tim Stocks are given<br />\ntwo fuzzy pages of photos, and most<br />\nof the Moratorium and strike photos<br />\nwill undoubtedly wring tearful sighs<br />\nof nostalgia from all of us.<br />\nThe yearbook surprises the<br />\nunwary reader by occasionally<br />\nthrowing in a tasteful or beautiful<br />\nphotograph. Certain professors,<br /><br />\nsome pretty girls, and a few nature<br />\nshots are delightful to look at.<br />\nUnfortunately, the yearbook staff<br />\nlost the photos of some groups,<br />\nforcing us to just look at drawings<br />\nand pretend. '<br />\nAlso, Adams has a fetish for<br />\nempty classrooms. Sprinkled<br />\nthroughout are crazy angles of<br />\nnothing but empty lecture halls. It's<br />\nso...alienated...with the empty<br />\nsilences of wooden desks. Get it? We<br />\nreceive a meaningless education,<br />\nsee, and so like nobody goes to<br />\nlecture, see, and like when<br />\nprofessors talk, see, it don't mean<br />\nanything...<br />\nAt the end, Adams writes, \"If we<br />\nhave failed, the responsibility rests<br />\nwith the Editor alone.\" Fortunately<br />\nfor him, he has already graduated.<br /><br />\nJames Joyce<br />\n2 February, 1882<br />\n'A king off duty and a jaw forever!'<br /><br />\nfeiffer<br />\nixecivNAtigroaR 4wocroe-.1<br /><br />\ngEpts-netourc -MC<br />\nNOME t,<br /><br />\nOVERTLIRoW TH EI,FARC<br />\n,I)F.E.AuckAcLo<br />\n\\<br /><br />\nC1E4 LIP rRe,<br /><br />\nologodyNr.,<br /><br />\n417*\u2022IPPS<br />\nCatiM3<br /><br />\ntt1:1<br /><br />\ncc.<br /><br />\n1?Ei/ouirioN<br /><br />\nAU<br /><br />\nPoweR<br /><br />\ntO<br /><br />\nTH6 P6OPIE<br /><br />\nRIGHT ON<br /><br />\nMAUI((ZO. lk) VXT<br />\nSPE1 0 FORE76k) R2,ICY<br />\nWl1,1_ 20 MV IMPPESSION<br />\n6AMDtii.<br /><br />\n4(1<br />\n1/4<br />\nst.
