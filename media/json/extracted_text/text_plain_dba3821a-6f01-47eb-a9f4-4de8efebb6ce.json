From the time of Columbus to Lindbergh there has<br />\n)t been a single century in which America has not been<br />\n'awn into the affairs of Europe. Does William Ran)lph Hearst really believe that, if isolationism was not<br />\n)ssible . . . even in ancient times, a great Power, a<br />\n.editor nation such as America, in the days of the aeroane can continue to pursue isolationism?<br />\n\"6. To keep America free of general or permanent<br />\nccmmitments and be guided by each circumstance as it<br />\na ises, was the method pursued before the War. Although America had no League Commitments in 1914<br />\na Ld men up to the last, William Randolph Hearst among<br />\nthem, proclaimed how free their hands were, America<br />\nIs drawn in.

As expressly<br />\nstated in its 1Covenant, the group is pledged to \"stimtlating the interest of students throughout the world<br />\n,n promoing international understanding and cooperaion in the hope of ultimately achieving and ensuring<br />\nnternational peace and security .<br />\nIn line with this policy, the Association decided to<br />\nwund out William Randolph Hearst with regard to his<br />\n)iews on nationalism and internationalism. He was ac,ordingly the recipient of an open letter which solicited<br />\nus reply to the following questions:<br />\n\"1. Does William Randolph Hearst agree that if we<br />\nAle on our already shaken and disordered economic sysem the further dislocations, unpayable debts, revoluions, which we now know are the necessary legacy of<br />\nvar and which so shook the relatively sound system of<br />\n914, then it will probably finish off the present order in<br />\nhaos?<br />\n\"2. Is it William Randolph Hearst's general view that<br />\nhe best way to prevent that recurrence is to continue the<br />\nid armament competition and decline to discuss interational agreement or organization? If so, on what<br />\nrounds does he believe that the old method will not<br />\nroduce the old result?<br />\n\"3. For a nation to be secure under the competitive<br />\nrinciple it must be stronger than any possible rival.<br />\nVhat becomes of the rival? Is he to go without dense? How shall defense of each be managed under<br />\nus plan since the security of the one means the inacurity of the other? Does William Randolph Hearst<br />\nLink that there is some system by which each can be<br />\n:ronger than the other?<br />\n\"4. If, in order to be secure, America must make her1.f stronger than a. rival, does William Randolph Hearst<br />\niggest that rival will accept the situation and not resort<br />\n) alliance making? And if that rival makes alliances,<br />\nAmerica to refrain from resorting to the same weam ? An alliance is an arm, like a battleship, or a subLarine, adding to a nation's power. Are Americans to<br />\nave this arm entirely' in the hands of prospective<br />\nvals?\"<br />\n\"5. From the time of Columbus to Lindbergh there has<br />\n)t been a single century in which America has not been<br />\n'awn into the affairs of Europe. Does William Ran)lph Hearst really believe that, if isolationism was not<br />\n)ssible . . . even in ancient times, a great Power, a<br />\n.editor nation such as America, in the days of the aeroane can continue to pursue isolationism?<br />\n\"6. To keep America free of general or permanent<br />\nccmmitments and be guided by each circumstance as it<br />\na ises, was the method pursued before the War. Although America had no League Commitments in 1914<br />\na Ld men up to the last, William Randolph Hearst among<br />\nthem, proclaimed how free their hands were, America<br />\nIs drawn in. Does William Randolph Hearst think<br />\nthat America could have kept out, that her entrance<br />\nWiis a mistake?<br />\n\"7. If he thinks America's entrance was a mistake,<br />\nRild he have regarded the victory of the Germanic<br />\nPC wers, the creation, that is, of an hegemony so preponderant that America could not have resisted any demds that it cared to make upon Americans, as a matte - of indifference? If so, why trouble about armaments<br />\nat all\u2014if it is a matter of indifference that combinati ns, much stronger than America, should arise?<br /><br />\nI believe in loving my neighbors as myself, but I have<br />\nnot yet reached the point where I am ready to sell all<br />\nI have and give every precious personal and national<br />\npossession to covetous neighboring nations who desire<br />\nthem but do not deserve them.<br />\nI believe in faith and common honesty among individuals and also among nations.<br />\nI believe in honor even among thieves.<br /><br />\nGorman \u2014 Labor Leader<br />\nWith More Than One Idea<br /><br />\nDEGAN UP<br />\nghe DIRT<br />\nBy LOU DEGAN<br />\nAlthough it hasn't been generally<br />\ncirculated, the managers of the legitimate theaters here in Baltimore<br />\nare more or less up a tree.
