It is foolish to predict a<br />\nchampionship before the last game of a schedule has been played,<br />\nand it is much more foolish to do so five months before the season<br />\nopens, but sometimes it is wise to give the matter some thought.<br />\nHopkins has more than an even chance to repeat. If she does,<br />\nand subsequently receives the Olympic selection, eight thousand<br />\ndollars will be necessary to send the team abroad. The Athletic<br />\nAssociation hasn't the funds; Heaven knows the University<br />\nhasn't. Where are they to come from?<br />\nThe eight thousand will have to be raised from among the<br />\nstudents and alumni. During the spring the Athletic Association<br />\nwill probably launch a campaign to insure the funds in the event<br />\nof good fortune. Meanwhile, alumni and students, start thinking<br />\nabout it!<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT GOVERNMENT AT PRINCETON<br />\nIn prescribing the duties of a Student Council to supersede the<br />\nold Senior Council, the Board of Trustees at Princeton University<br />\nhas acted with great circumspection and foresight. It has recognized definitely the right of students to a clearly articulate voice<br />\nin their own affairs, and established the Council with this view<br />\npredominant.<br />\nThe scope of the Student Council at Princeton is broader than<br />\nit is here at Hopkins. Its duties include the supervision of practically every phase of undergraduate life. The Council is not<br />\nspecifically charged with the maintenance of the honor system,<br />\nbut is \"the recognized medium of communication between the<br />\nauthorities and the students of the University on all questions<br />\nof student conduct, student opinion, and in all questions concerning the welfare of the University in which students have a<br />\nyoice.\" The members are accorded both membership and voting<br />\npower on certain faculty committees, and are to be called upon<br />\nbefore final action is taken upon any matters of undergraduate<br />\nlife. If these stipulations be strictly adhered to, and if the judgment of the Student Council is regarded generally as acceptable<br />\nand mature, the provisions are highly important. For not only<br />\nare the students allowed the prerogative of action in matters that<br />\naffect their personal conduct, but they are granted a voice in<br />\npractically any matter that affects them at all. It must be assumed,<br />\nof course, that the men represented on the Council are of the<br />\nvery highest type, and that they accept the responsibility of their<br />\npositions sincerely.<br />\nThe powers of the Princeton body are not specified in great<br />\ndetail, for it was felt that with the passing of time, the Council's<br />\njurisdiction could be enlarged. _Moreover, as the Princetonian<br />\npoints out, inasmuch as the ultimate responsibility for all phases<br />\nof undergraduate life rests with the Board of Trustees, that body<br />\nhas the final veto.<br />\nAfter the, disastrous end of the Senior Council last spring, the<br />\ndelegation of the same, and even greater powers to a similar<br />\norganization is in the nature of an experiment.

This group of five lectures on Shakespeare, by Professor<br />\nFouillerat, is made possible through<br />\nthe annual Turnbull Memorial Lec<br />\ntures.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Fouillerat,<br />\nShakespeare first began to write<br />\nfor financial gain. His early attempts were begun with the view of<br />\nobtaining a certain wealthy nobleman as a patron. The original<br />\nstyle was influenced by the prevalent aristocratic view of literature.<br />\n<br />\nThe Athletic Association is doing<br />\neverything in its power to encourage<br />\nthe early sale of tickets for this<br />\nyear's Maryland game. This effort<br />\nis being made in order to eliminate<br />\nthe confusion and delay which takes<br />\nplace every year, due to the late<br />\nbuying of tickets.

Among his other successes<br />\nwere the isolation of adrenalin and<br />\nthe invention of the artific'al kidney. Adrenalin is a drug that<br />\nstrengthens the heart. It has proved<br />\nvaluable during operations and severe cases of pneumonia. It has<br />\neven been known to restore to life<br />\ninfants for whom all hope has been<br />\nlost.<br />\nThe artificial kidney is a mechanism which may be used for washing<br />\npoisons from the blood of the body.<br />\nIt, too, has been used very advantageously.<br />\n<br />\nThis first talk on the famous poet<br />\nand his works was a direct comparison between his \"Venus and Adonis\" and his \"Rape of Lucrece.\" The<br />\nauthor seemed to have lived in retrospect while writing the former.<br />\nHe looks back upon the simplicity<br />\nof the primeval race and allows<br />\nthat to guide his style. \"There is<br />\nnothing artificial about the whole<br />\nwork,\" Mr. Fouillerat stated.<br />\nIt begins at sunrise with all the<br />\nbeauty of nature expressed in the<br />\nlyrical lines. Shakespeare here displays his marvelous power of vivid<br />\ndescription in the fewest words<br />\nwith the most striking effect.<br />\nThroughout the whole one sees<br />\nnothing but superb beauty.<br />\n\"The Rape of Lucrece,\" differing from \"Venus and Adonis,\"<br />\nshows that Shakespeare had acquired.a greater knowledge of the<br />\nvices of the world. The images<br />\nbrought about by the rhetorical excursions are indeed striking. Even<br />\nthe blush of Lucrece lends the author an excuse for a passage on<br />\nvirtue.<br />\n<br />\nDiscovered Epinephrine<br />\n<br />\nDarkness Is Employed<br />\n<br />\nAnother notable discovery was<br />\nmade by the Pharmacologist about<br />\ntwenty years ago. This was the<br />\ndiscovery of Epinephrine, which is<br />\nthe active principle of a gland situated above the kidneys, known as<br />\nthe suprarenal gland.<br />\nThe scientist has contributed to<br />\nscience in another way than that of<br />\nscientific discoveries. He is the author of \"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.\" This book is considered equal<br />\nto or better than any book of similar contents.<br />\nDr. Abel, who is a graduate of<br />\nthe University of Michigan and<br />\nthe University of Strasburg, has<br />\nbeen connected with the Medical<br />\nSchool since 1893. He is now preparing to complete the analysis of<br />\nthe chemical composition of the insulin crystal.<br />\n<br />\nLucrece is ghastly in most of its<br />\nsetting. Darkness is employed to<br />\nlend the atmosphere of terror and<br />\nevil. \"Venus and Adonis,\" however, relies on light and nature for<br />\nits poetry.<br />\nVenus is cynical and sensual in<br />\nsome places almost to an extreme.<br />\nLucrece consists of a tirade against<br />\nlust and evil. It seems as if it<br />\nwere an apology for the sensuality<br />\nof Venus and Adonis.<br />\nBesides the theme there is a subtler poetry in the visions in Lucrece.<br />\nThis latter work is interesting, not<br />\nonly because of its dramatic points,<br />\nbut also it is the link between the<br />\nearlier work, \"Venus and Adonis,\"<br />\nand the lyrical genius expressed in<br />\nthe sonnets.<br />\nThe next lecture will be held this<br />\nafternoon in the Civil Engineering<br />\nHall at 5 o'clock.<br />\n<br />\nOther Achievements<br />\n<br />\nMaryland Game<br />\nTickets on Sale<br />\n<br />\nbreedka c<br />\nCONTENT<br />\nTHE longer you smoke Prince<br />\nAlbert, the more convinced you<br />\nbecome that it is the most satisfying tobacco that ever nestled in<br />\nthe bowl of a jimmy-pipe.

If she does,<br />\nand subsequently receives the Olympic selection, eight thousand<br />\ndollars will be necessary to send the team abroad. The Athletic<br />\nAssociation hasn't the funds; Heaven knows the University<br />\nhasn't. Where are they to come from?<br />\nThe eight thousand will have to be raised from among the<br />\nstudents and alumni. During the spring the Athletic Association<br />\nwill probably launch a campaign to insure the funds in the event<br />\nof good fortune. Meanwhile, alumni and students, start thinking<br />\nabout it!<br /><br />\nSTUDENT GOVERNMENT AT PRINCETON<br />\nIn prescribing the duties of a Student Council to supersede the<br />\nold Senior Council, the Board of Trustees at Princeton University<br />\nhas acted with great circumspection and foresight. It has recognized definitely the right of students to a clearly articulate voice<br />\nin their own affairs, and established the Council with this view<br />\npredominant.<br />\nThe scope of the Student Council at Princeton is broader than<br />\nit is here at Hopkins. Its duties include the supervision of practically every phase of undergraduate life. The Council is not<br />\nspecifically charged with the maintenance of the honor system,<br />\nbut is \"the recognized medium of communication between the<br />\nauthorities and the students of the University on all questions<br />\nof student conduct, student opinion, and in all questions concerning the welfare of the University in which students have a<br />\nyoice.\" The members are accorded both membership and voting<br />\npower on certain faculty committees, and are to be called upon<br />\nbefore final action is taken upon any matters of undergraduate<br />\nlife. If these stipulations be strictly adhered to, and if the judgment of the Student Council is regarded generally as acceptable<br />\nand mature, the provisions are highly important. For not only<br />\nare the students allowed the prerogative of action in matters that<br />\naffect their personal conduct, but they are granted a voice in<br />\npractically any matter that affects them at all. It must be assumed,<br />\nof course, that the men represented on the Council are of the<br />\nvery highest type, and that they accept the responsibility of their<br />\npositions sincerely.<br />\nThe powers of the Princeton body are not specified in great<br />\ndetail, for it was felt that with the passing of time, the Council's<br />\njurisdiction could be enlarged. _Moreover, as the Princetonian<br />\npoints out, inasmuch as the ultimate responsibility for all phases<br />\nof undergraduate life rests with the Board of Trustees, that body<br />\nhas the final veto.<br />\nAfter the, disastrous end of the Senior Council last spring, the<br />\ndelegation of the same, and even greater powers to a similar<br />\norganization is in the nature of an experiment.

FOUILLERAT GIVES<br />\nFIRST OF LECTURES<br />\nProfessor Makes Comparison of<br />\nTwo of Shakespeare's Works<br />\n\"Lucrece is a .series of lyrical<br />\nsuggestions, while 'Venus and<br />\nAdonis' is a succession of beautiful<br />\nexperiences,\" said Professor Albert<br />\nFouillerat in the first of his series<br />\nof lectures. This group of five lectures on Shakespeare, by Professor<br />\nFouillerat, is made possible through<br />\nthe annual Turnbull Memorial Lec<br />\ntures.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Fouillerat,<br />\nShakespeare first began to write<br />\nfor financial gain. His early attempts were begun with the view of<br />\nobtaining a certain wealthy nobleman as a patron. The original<br />\nstyle was influenced by the prevalent aristocratic view of literature.<br /><br />\nThe Athletic Association is doing<br />\neverything in its power to encourage<br />\nthe early sale of tickets for this<br />\nyear's Maryland game. This effort<br />\nis being made in order to eliminate<br />\nthe confusion and delay which takes<br />\nplace every year, due to the late<br />\nbuying of tickets. Mr. Iddens,<br />\nbusiness manager of athletics, is<br />\nmaking a threefold appeal concerning this matter to the Johns Hopkins Alumni, to the student body<br />\nand to the merchants of Baltimore.<br /><br />\nNight\u2014Madison 1536<br /><br />\nMadison 5355<br /><br />\nJONES CHEVROLET<br />\nSALES COMPANY<br />\n\"A Friendly Organization\"<br /><br />\nMT.

Among his other successes<br />\nwere the isolation of adrenalin and<br />\nthe invention of the artific'al kidney. Adrenalin is a drug that<br />\nstrengthens the heart. It has proved<br />\nvaluable during operations and severe cases of pneumonia. It has<br />\neven been known to restore to life<br />\ninfants for whom all hope has been<br />\nlost.<br />\nThe artificial kidney is a mechanism which may be used for washing<br />\npoisons from the blood of the body.<br />\nIt, too, has been used very advantageously.<br /><br />\nThis first talk on the famous poet<br />\nand his works was a direct comparison between his \"Venus and Adonis\" and his \"Rape of Lucrece.\" The<br />\nauthor seemed to have lived in retrospect while writing the former.<br />\nHe looks back upon the simplicity<br />\nof the primeval race and allows<br />\nthat to guide his style. \"There is<br />\nnothing artificial about the whole<br />\nwork,\" Mr. Fouillerat stated.<br />\nIt begins at sunrise with all the<br />\nbeauty of nature expressed in the<br />\nlyrical lines. Shakespeare here displays his marvelous power of vivid<br />\ndescription in the fewest words<br />\nwith the most striking effect.<br />\nThroughout the whole one sees<br />\nnothing but superb beauty.<br />\n\"The Rape of Lucrece,\" differing from \"Venus and Adonis,\"<br />\nshows that Shakespeare had acquired.a greater knowledge of the<br />\nvices of the world. The images<br />\nbrought about by the rhetorical excursions are indeed striking. Even<br />\nthe blush of Lucrece lends the author an excuse for a passage on<br />\nvirtue.<br /><br />\nDiscovered Epinephrine<br /><br />\nDarkness Is Employed<br /><br />\nAnother notable discovery was<br />\nmade by the Pharmacologist about<br />\ntwenty years ago. This was the<br />\ndiscovery of Epinephrine, which is<br />\nthe active principle of a gland situated above the kidneys, known as<br />\nthe suprarenal gland.<br />\nThe scientist has contributed to<br />\nscience in another way than that of<br />\nscientific discoveries. He is the author of \"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.\" This book is considered equal<br />\nto or better than any book of similar contents.<br />\nDr. Abel, who is a graduate of<br />\nthe University of Michigan and<br />\nthe University of Strasburg, has<br />\nbeen connected with the Medical<br />\nSchool since 1893. He is now preparing to complete the analysis of<br />\nthe chemical composition of the insulin crystal.<br /><br />\nLucrece is ghastly in most of its<br />\nsetting. Darkness is employed to<br />\nlend the atmosphere of terror and<br />\nevil. \"Venus and Adonis,\" however, relies on light and nature for<br />\nits poetry.<br />\nVenus is cynical and sensual in<br />\nsome places almost to an extreme.<br />\nLucrece consists of a tirade against<br />\nlust and evil. It seems as if it<br />\nwere an apology for the sensuality<br />\nof Venus and Adonis.<br />\nBesides the theme there is a subtler poetry in the visions in Lucrece.<br />\nThis latter work is interesting, not<br />\nonly because of its dramatic points,<br />\nbut also it is the link between the<br />\nearlier work, \"Venus and Adonis,\"<br />\nand the lyrical genius expressed in<br />\nthe sonnets.<br />\nThe next lecture will be held this<br />\nafternoon in the Civil Engineering<br />\nHall at 5 o'clock.<br /><br />\nOther Achievements<br /><br />\nMaryland Game<br />\nTickets on Sale<br /><br />\nbreedka c<br />\nCONTENT<br />\nTHE longer you smoke Prince<br />\nAlbert, the more convinced you<br />\nbecome that it is the most satisfying tobacco that ever nestled in<br />\nthe bowl of a jimmy-pipe.
