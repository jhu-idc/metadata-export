At a previous meeting,<br />\nthe council voted support for the Hopkins ad<br />\nhoc committee for the Vietnam Moratorium.<br />\nThe new resolution condemns the \"continued<br />\ninvolvement of the United States in Vietnam\"<br />\nand endorses the \"proposal by Senator Charles<br />\nGoodell of New York calling for a withdrawal of<br />\nall United States forces from Vietnam by the<br />\nend of 1979.Faculty Support<br />\nThe SC also called upon the _faculty of the<br />\nUniversity \"to support the Vietnam Moratorium<br />\nby cancelling all classes on October 15.\" Eleven<br />\nfaculty members had already begun to circulate<br />\na letter and petition of support for the<br />\nMoratorium.<br />\nThe resolution, introduced by junior class<br />\nrepresentative Bill Betcher, pointed out that the<br />\npresidents of Rutgers 'University and the<br />\nUniversity of Michigan have already called for<br />\nschool-wide participation in the Moratorium at<br />\ntheir respective schools. The resolution<br />\nencouraged the Hopkins administration to take<br />\nsimilar steps by saying \"in view of the<br />\nimportance of this day both for the University<br />\nand for the entire country, we feel that the<br />\nUniversity has an obligation to particpate in the<br />\nobservance of the Moratorium.\"<br />\nIn a statement released on September 30, Dr.<br />\nGordon responded to the SC resolution passed<br />\nthe day before. The President cited a letter he<br />\nhad written on March 21, 1968 to a faculty<br />\nmember who had requested that the University<br />\n<br />\nbe closed down for the \"Academic Days of<br />\nConscience.\" In that letter he denied the request<br />\nbecause, \"In substance. .. several of your<br />\nsuggestions, including the suspension of regular<br />\nclasses ... would imply the adoption of an<br />\nofficial, institutional, University position in<br />\nrelation to the war.\"<br />\nThe letter continues,\"... Johns Hopkins has<br />\nalways maintainerl an exceptionally liberal<br />\nattitude towards the expression of views on<br />\nmatters of public interest and concern by all<br />\nmembers of the University community. There is<br />\nno inhibition on individual or organized<br />\nmanifestations of opinion, so long as they do<br />\nnot impair the freedom of others orinterfere<br />\nwith the normal functioning of the University.\"<br />\n\"Constrained\"<br />\n\"On the other hand,\" wrote Dr. Gordon,<br />\n\"the University has never adopted an official<br />\ninstitutional position on controverted public<br />\nissues, and I believe that it would be most<br />\nundesirable for it to do so. Members of the<br />\ncommunity, whether a majority or a minority,<br />\nwho differed from the 'official position'<br />\nwould inevitably feel constrained by its very<br />\nannouncement.'<br />\nPresident Gordon did state that although the<br />\nadministration would not support the<br />\nMoratorium it would not prohibit to members<br />\nof the University community participation in its<br />\nactivities. The President's statement reads<br />\n\"... this conclusion in no way prevents<br />\nindividual students, faculty members,<br />\nadministrators, or groupings of them to make<br />\ncrystal clear their opinions on policy concerning<br />\nthe warm n Vietnam or any other issue.\" Dr.<br />\nGordon also indicates that \"The freedom of<br />\nstudents to attend particular classes or not on an<br />\nindividual voluntary basis is equally well<br />\nestablished.\"<br />\nThe President's statement says, \"Institutional<br />\nuniversity positions on matters of public policy<br />\nnot directly affecting the academic enterprise<br />\nare simply not compatible with the intransigent<br />\n<br />\nhe by<br />\n<br />\ndefense of academic freedom, a cause which this<br />\nUniversity has consistently defended since its<br />\nvery foundation.\"<br />\nPersonal Views<br />\nExplaining his personal views of the war in<br />\nVietnam Dr. Gordon cited a personal requrest<br />\nfrom President Lyndon Johnson in March, 1968<br />\nfor his opinions on the war. Dr. Gordon said, \"I<br />\nstated clearly my opinion that the decisions<br />\nmade in 1954, 1961, and 1965 (by Eisenhower,<br />\nKennedy and Johnson respectively) had been<br />\nmistaken. I recommended a policy of prompt<br />\nde-Americanization of the militaty and<br />\n'pacification' efforts and a broader political base<br />\nfor the government in Saigon.\" President<br />\nGordon points out that coincidentally his views<br />\nare \"parallel to Defense Secretary Clifford's<br />\nproposals as he related them in Foreign Affairs<br />\nlast July.\"<br />\nPresident Gordon sees some efforts in this<br />\ndirection, but considers them to be \"too small<br />\nand too halting.\" Even considering the state of<br />\nthe war today Dr. Gordon does not think that<br />\nunilateral withdrawal is the best course.\"If I did<br />\nbelieve so, I would want it done much more<br />\nrapidly than the fifteen months suggested in<br />\nSenator Goodell's resolution.\"<br />\n\"Moral Obligation\"<br />\nThe President sees the possibility for a<br />\npolitical settlement as not \"wholly unrealizable,<br />\nwithin a short time period.\" He also believes<br />\nthat the United States has a \"moral obligation in<br />\nany circumstances to provide for the safety of<br />\nindividuals in South Vietnam who have relied on<br />\nour commitments \u2014 however unwisely<br />\nmade \u2014 in recent years.\"<br />\nDr. Gordon discussed his statement with<br />\nBetcher and Manuel Rodriguez, another SC<br />\nmember strongly supporting the resolution,<br />\nbefore releasing it to the press.<br />\nRodrigues criticized the statement saying,\"I<br />\ncan see how from his position Gordon's logic<br />\n(Continued on page 15)<br />\n<br />\nA...<br />\n<br />\n\u00a3A A& A.Ati.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD.

Dr. Swanson told Szoka<br />\nthat the Academic Council and the<br />\nFaculty at large did not have any<br />\nintention for use of that time during the<br />\nfirst year of the new calendar program.<br />\nBosted presented the inter-session<br />\ntime as a challenge to the SC sponsored<br />\nlecture course that was proposed and<br />\naccepted two weeks ago. He calims that<br />\nany academic activity during the<br />\nmini-semester should be financed by the<br />\nUniversity and that the Visiting<br />\nlectureship is an unnecessary financial<br />\nburden on the SC.<br />\nBosted further sees the visiting<br />\nlectureship as an extension of the<br />\nstandard courses given during the<br />\n<br />\n/CAMPUS NOTES<br />\nBLACKEST HUMOR<br />\nThe Office of Speical Events will<br />\npresent Dick Gregory on Thursday,<br />\nOctober 9 at 4 p.m. at Shriver Hall.

Chuck<br />\nFax, a senior class representative to the<br />\nSC, suggested at that time that the<br />\nmotion be tabled pending further study<br />\nand investigation oi campus opinion.<br />\nThe motion, directed at challenging<br />\nthe established academic process of the<br />\nUniversity, proved to contain certain<br />\ninaccuracies about the means of getting<br />\naccredidation for courses and<br />\nappointment of visiting faculty<br />\nmembers.<br />\nThese fallacies were considered<br />\nsecondary by Rodriguez to the<br />\nimportance of demonstrating the ability<br />\nof the student body to maturely<br />\norganize and support an academic<br />\nCourse.<br />\n<br />\nGoolrick complained that the SRC<br />\nhad aCtea 'bn a proposal that would<br />\n<br />\nplace excessive financial burdens on<br />\nregular SC projects. He pointed out that<br />\nthe Council had already determined that<br />\nthe social budget would have to be<br />\ncurtailed in order to fund the course.<br />\nObjection was raised to this because<br />\nsocial functions have long been<br />\nconsidered one of their main tasks.<br />\nSince most of the SC budget comes<br />\nfrom the Student Activity Fee paid at<br />\nregistration, Goolrick felt that the<br />\nstudent body should have had an<br />\nopportunity to express its opinion<br />\nbefore adoption of the student-run<br />\ncourse proposal.<br />\nSeveral members of the Council felt<br />\nthat consulting with the student body<br />\nwas unneccessary since they are elected<br />\nto lend direction to the undergraduate<br />\nbody. One member felt that he had<br />\nbeen elected on the basis of his attitudes<br />\nand that the students had given all<br />\npower of decision to him and the other<br />\nrepresentatives of the Council.<br />\nFax and other SC representatives felt<br />\nthat the proposal should have been<br />\noffered to the student body in<br />\nreferendum before any action to adopt<br />\nit was taken.

He defined<br />\nconfidential matters as hearings for<br />\nPossible promotions, incompetency and<br />\nother issues that may be \"personally<br />\nembarrassing to a faculty member.\"<br />\nAccording to Kimball, the Council<br />\nalso discussed the need for reforms in<br />\nthe governing structure of the<br />\nUniversity during last week's meeting.<br />\nA lot of faculty feel that the Academic<br />\nCouncil should not be the body to cope<br />\nwith all the problems on campus, but<br />\nShould be concerned only with<br />\nacademic policies,\" the dean observed.<br />\nHe stated that the Academic Council<br />\nwill probably decide the procedures for<br />\nstudying Hopkins' structure of<br />\ngoverment during its October 15<br />\nmeeting. The Council, Kimball<br />\npredicted, will appoint a study group<br />\nwhich in turn will select a second<br />\ncommittee charged to draft a proposal<br />\nfor reforms in the University's<br />\ngovernance procedures. Kimball said<br />\nthat this second group should include<br />\nundergraduate and graduate students.<br />\nThe Academic Council's discussions<br />\nlast Wednesday were prompted by a<br />\nreport presented by Dr. M.

Although he declined to<br />\nendorce the senate idea, he said that it<br />\nwas conveivable that a new<br />\nrepresentative body may be created by<br />\nnext September.<br />\nWith the exception of Dr. Peter<br />\nRossi, chairman of the social relations<br />\ndepartment and Dean Robert Strider, all<br />\nthe other members of the Academic<br />\nCouncil contacted refused to spell out<br />\ntheir positions on the Owen proposal.<br />\nDrs. Stanley Corrsin of the<br />\nmechanics department, Ferdinand<br />\nHamburger, Jr. of electrical engineering,<br />\nDean Carl Swanson and three other<br />\nfaculty members of the Academic<br />\nCouncil declined to express their<br />\nOpinions on the university senate. Most<br />\nsaid they needed time to think it over.<br />\n\"Feasible and Reasonable\"<br />\n\"Rossi, however, stated that the<br />\nsenate plan appeared \"feasible and<br />\nreasonable,\" and he expressed a desire<br />\nfor its approval. The social relations<br />\nchairman endorsed the idea of a<br />\nfifty-fifty split between students and<br />\nfaculty members in the proposed senate.<br />\n\"There is probably more wisdom in the<br />\nuniversity body than in the Academic<br />\nCouncil,\" he asserted.<br />\nThe right for student attendence at<br />\nall university meetings, though, was<br />\nrejected by Rossi. He said that in<br />\npersonal issues or matters involving an<br />\nindividual faculty member, only his<br />\npeers should be present. He also<br />\ncautioned against abuses in student<br />\nelections for representatives. \"It<br />\nshouldn't become merely a popularity<br />\ncontest,\" he declared.<br />\nDr. Edwin Mills of economics and a<br />\nCouncil member, stated he was<br />\nindifferent to the proposal. It has<br />\nmerits, he claimed, but he saw no<br />\nsubstance in its present form. He also<br />\nsaid that other campus groups, such as<br />\nthe administration and university<br />\nemployees, should be entitled to a voice<br />\nat the senate proceedings. However, in<br />\nthe area of student interest in campus<br />\naffairs, Mills was enthusiastic. \"I think<br />\nj'66iP<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 3<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nstudent concern for all the aspects of<br />\nuniversity life is terrific,\" he<br />\nmaintained,\"and I hope it continues.\"<br />\nDean Carl Swanson stated that he did<br />\nnot have sufficient time yet to fully<br />\nconsider the implications of a new<br />\nlegislative body.

Utilizing the recent advances in genetics,<br />\nresearchers at the base have been developing techniques<br />\nthat will enable them to develop a variety of diseases<br />\nsuch as bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, and anthra,<br />\nthat nd longer could be cured by current antibiotics.<br />\nNearly 3000 civilians and military men work at<br />\nDetrick, hoping to discover potential new disease agents<br />\nand then learning to defend against them. The work has<br />\nbeen termed \"biological ,engineering\" by the. germ<br />\nwarriors of Detrick.<br />\nSome 530 million a year is spent at Detrick for these<br />\npurposes. Its professional staff includes 120 men with<br />\nPH.D. degrees in such fields as microbiology and<br />\nbiomathematics; 110 men with M.A. degrees, and 320<br />\nB.S. degree-holders. The base also has four medical<br />\ndoctors and 34 veterinarians on its staff.

Housewright indicated<br />\nthat he disagrees with the Amry's policy of not allowing<br />\narmy employees to speak on CpW.<br />\n\"I admit that the Army has not had a very good PR<br />\nprogram in the last six months.\" Housewright has been<br />\nasked to speak at Rutgers, Stanford, Mexico City.

The action is remarkably<br />\nsimilar to the State Board of Trustees'<br />\naction last year at this time when they<br />\nvoted to fire George Murray, a Black<br />\nPanther instructor, from San Francisco<br />\nState.

It is not expected that the<br />\ncommittee, however, will overturn the<br />\nRegents' rulings. Even if it does, the<br />\nPresident can still veto their actions.<br />\nBehind the Scenes<br />\nBoth this year's and last year's firings<br />\nwere engineered by Governor Ronald<br />\nReagan who has repeatedly demanded<br />\nMiss Davis' firing in- several recent<br />\nspeeches.

It is subsidized by the Student<br />\nAssociation, who also gives Krohn and<br />\nhis cronies office space and access to a<br />\nmimeograph machine. From there on<br />\ndown, most of the organization is left<br />\nup to the teachers. The teachers are not<br />\nteachers in the Mr. Chips sense of the<br />\nword, but are interested people whose<br />\nonly qualification is a sincere desire to<br />\naid in the communication and<br />\nissemination of ideas among a group. In<br />\nthe informality of the classes, the<br />\nteacher does not serve as an immovable<br />\nanchor, but merely as a starting point<br />\nfor a dialogue: abserved a former<br />\nstudent.<br />\nNow, while this is the theory, last<br />\nyear's experiences of the B.F.U. provide<br />\na talc of woe that the organizers hope<br />\nwill not be repeated again.<br />\nTypical Story<br />\nElliot Krieger, a senior who taught<br />\nEnglish Composition courses in the Free<br />\nU. last year, told a typical story of how<br />\nthe initial enrollment in his second<br />\nsemester class was eleven people.

This year the teachers will hold<br />\nclasses in their own homes, whenever<br />\npossible, or at Hopkins.<br />\nThis semester, Krohn is starting out<br />\nby offering a modest selection of<br />\ncourses that schools like Hopkins<br />\nusually don't pusn. They include<br />\ncourses in: Acting, Introductory<br />\nReligions, Chess, Creative Writing,<br />\nCommunism, and Philosophy. There is<br />\nalso a film workshop. a \"pure group\"<br />\nthat will discuss profound questions of<br />\nthe<br />\nday, and for the<br />\nman-who-has-everything, there is a<br />\ncourse in Einstein's principles of<br />\nunification.<br />\nIntellectual Nucleus<br />\n' It is apparent that the courses given<br />\nwill mostly appeal to what Krohn<br />\nrecognizes as an \"intellectual necleus\"<br />\naround which he hopes the student<br />\nbody will build itself. This \"nucleus\"<br />\nconsists mainly of middle-class working<br />\npeople and college students. At first, the<br />\nFree University will not make a<br />\nconcerted effort to attract inner city<br />\nresidents, but will offer black culture<br />\ncourses (provided teachers are found)<br />\nonce the school's position becomes<br />\nfairly secure.<br />\nWhen this security comes, the B.F.U.<br />\nwould like to dissociate itself from<br />\nHopkins, and become a community<br />\nsupported project.<br />\nDennis Krohn, who appears very<br />\ndedicated to the cause, would certainly<br />\nbe happy if the school is a success this<br />\nsemester, but will stick with it through<br />\nthe year even if it fails, and will be sure<br />\nthat it has some sort of continuity of<br />\nleadership into the next year.<br />\nPhilosophy Lesson<br />\n\"Hopefully, this noble experiment\"<br />\nwill not fail.

However, this<br />\ndiscrepancy is explainable. Gordon<br />\nstated. He said that IQ tests- in early<br />\nchildhood are concerned more with<br />\nmotor nerve responses than abstract<br />\nreasoning. \"It has been found that<br />\nNegroes mature more quickly in early<br />\nchildhood than white,\" he maintained.<br />\n\"Therefore their scores go down in the<br />\nlater, more abstract tests.<br />\nThe effects of nutrition on a child's<br />\nnative abilities were mentioned by all<br />\nthe professors and in the text of the<br />\nJensen article.

Gordon.<br />\nHartman, Rossi and Swanson stated that<br />\nmore research on the effects of prenatal<br />\nand infancy care on intelligence should<br />\nbe conducted. \"The nutrition of the<br />\nfetus can greatly effect the aptitude of a<br />\nchild,\" Hartman observed. Dr.<br />\nJacobson', however, asserted that only in<br />\nvery extreme cases would nutrition play<br />\na part in a child's mental acumen. He<br />\ncited IQ tests taken in the Philippines<br />\nand other places in the Far East which<br />\nplaced Asian children on the same level<br />\nwith white IQ scores despite their<br />\nimproverished conditions.<br />\nStatistical Evidence<br />\nThe statistics from the Jensen report<br />\nand other surveys indicate that only<br />\nfifteen per cent of the black population<br />\nreaches or exceeds the white norm of<br />\n100 points. Likewise, Negroes<br />\ndisproportionately occupy the bottom<br />\nend of the IQ scale. Only two per cent<br />\nof black high school students receive<br />\ngrades over 500 on the SAT verbal and<br />\nmath tests as compared to about 28 per<br />\ncent of the whites. Blacks, however,<br />\nhave tested relatively better than their<br />\nwhite counterparts -in associative, oi<br />\nrote, learning.<br />\nThese and other statistics have led<br />\nDr. Jacobson to delcarc that a black<br />\ngenius is a rarity. Dr. Gordon also used<br />\nthis evidence to observe that the dearth<br />\nof black students and professors at the<br />\nnation's top ranked colleges and<br />\nuniversities is due to the Negro's lower<br />\ncognitive ability, not discriminatory<br />\nselection procedures. He concluded that<br />\nHopkins should statistically have a two<br />\nper cent black faculty.<br />\n(Hopkins has amassed a three per<br />\ncent black ratio on campus.)<br />\nDr. Gordon also completely agreed<br />\nwith C.P. Snow's statement last spring<br />\nthat the Jews are genetically superior to<br />\ngentiles. \"Yes, the Jews have an average<br />\nIQ of 108, that's why they do so well,\"<br />\nGordothln concluded.

Lincoln Gordon has done it again this time with two nearly<br />\nincredible quotes about the Viet Nam moratorium. First, Dr. Gordon<br />\nstated that the moratorium is not an effective means of protesting the war.<br />\nWhether or not this is true remains to be answered by the events of the<br />\nnext several months. What is objectionable is that Dr. Gordon cited this as<br />\na reason for not lending Hopkins' support to the moratorium effort.<br />\nIt is as if Gordon does not want to sully the name of Hopkins by having<br />\nit associated with an effort which is not effective . He obviously does not<br />\nsee the war as anything particularly odious odious enough so that any<br />\nlegal effort to end it is worthy of support. Certainly, Dr. Gordon is<br />\nentitled to this view as his personal opinion on the war. However, in his<br />\nPosition of spokesman and executive for the university, he should not be<br />\nafforded the luxury of enforcing his opinion on the university as an<br />\ninstitution. The silence from Hopkins on the moratorium amounts to<br />\nnothing less than tacit complicity with the protracted war and rejection of<br />\nthe peace movement.<br />\nIn light of this, Dr. Gordon's second statement becomes almost<br />\nlaughable. He says that he does not think it proper for the university to<br />\ntake a stand on political issues. The fact that he has made his own<br />\npreference for non-compliance with the moratorium the university's stand<br />\ndoes not seem to phase him in the least.<br />\n. Moreover, in his attempt to leave the university uncommitted and<br />\nirreproachable, our President has neglected one fact which negates his<br />\nentire argument. The university took a stand more than 25 years ago, with<br />\nthe creation of the Applied Physics Laboratory. The APL sparked the<br />\nNavy's interest in atomic research and contributed to the creation of the<br />\natom bomb.(But that was during World War II, when everyone thought it<br />\nwas in service to America). During the next decade, Hopkins<br />\nresearchers developed the Tabs, Tartar and Terrier missles for the Navy.<br />\nToday, Hopkins checks out every Polaris missile submarine for the Navy's<br />\nFleet Ballistic Missile Program.

This presents an<br />\nunfortunate choice for Hopkins Students. Many will feel that they should<br />\ngo to class either on principle or for pragmatic reasons, even though they<br />\nwould like to register their non-support of the war and their sympathy<br />\nWith the moratorium.<br />\nThis choice should have been eliminated by Hopkins' closing for the<br />\nday.

Similarly all graduate students should cancel<br />\ntheir classes and conferences that day.<br />\nIn addition, students have a responsibility to suspend their daily<br />\nroutine of classes and studies.

Occasionally one discovers<br />\nthat Cleveland wrote poetry. His poetry,<br />\nusually light verse, is uniformly<br />\nmiserable.<br />\nTransports of Work<br />\nObviously the authors of the<br />\nCleveland campaign literature could not<br />\nhave made him exciting. Instead, it is<br />\nstressed that he was a methodical and<br />\ndeligent worker, and that he would<br />\nnever fall behind in expediting the<br />\nWhite House paperwork. It appears that,<br />\nin his early days as a struggling lawyer in<br />\nBuffalo; Cleveland acquired the valuable<br />\nhabit of struggling until midnight and<br />\nsleeping at his desk.<br />\nIn higher office, his transports of<br />\nwork were even more impressive.<br />\nLacking the mercurial qualities of<br />\nBlaine, he became, both literally and<br />\nfiguratively, one of the solider citizens<br />\nof his community. It was at the bidding<br />\nof other solid citizens that he had been<br />\n\"up and doing\" through four years as<br />\nSheriff of Erie County,one as Mayor of<br />\nBuffalo and two as Governor of New<br />\nYork.<br />\nThere is no need to discuss the<br />\ndetails of the 1884 campaign, but it<br />\nmust be stressed that the 1904 image of<br />\nParker borrowed heavily from the 1884<br />\nimage of Cleveland. Roosevelt was not<br />\nas questionable in his ethics as Blaine<br />\nhad been, although, as we shall see,<br />\nParker eventually attempted to fashion<br />\nan issue of Roosevelt's ethics. But the<br />\nParker literature pictures Roosevelt as<br />\nimpetuous and erratic, even as the<br />\nCleveland literature of 1884 had<br />\npictured Blaine. Parker's place with<br />\nCleveland is presented even less subtly.<br />\n<br />\nMore Transports<br />\nParker, like Cleveland, is celebrated<br />\nfor his transports of labor. Parker, like<br />\nCleveland, is known for a devotion to<br />\nhis family, which hindered his<br />\neducation. Parker, like Cleveland, is<br />\nrenowned for his sturdy New England<br />\nextraction. Parker, like Cleveland, is<br />\ncelebrated for assimilating enormous<br />\namounts of material before reaching a<br />\ndecision. Parker, like Cleveland, is<br />\nfamous for his devotion to public<br />\nservice and his methodical, conservative<br />\napproach to problems. The two even<br />\nappear to share a taste for outdoor<br />\nrecreation.<br />\nIt is manifest that the Democrats<br />\nwere not conceding a personality battle<br />\nwith Roosevelt. The fact is that, in<br />\nelections prior to 1904, the methodical<br />\ncandidate had faced the mercurial on at<br />\nleast equal grounds. Grant admittedly<br />\nhad a dashing reputation, but he was<br />\npresented as a solid and sober executive<br />\nin two contests against notable orators.<br />\nIn 1876, both parties stressed their<br />\ncandidates' methodical application to<br />\npiles of work. In 1880 the Republicans<br />\nstressed the scholarly and methodical<br />\nmethod of James Garfield, while the<br />\nDemocrats tried to pump some color<br />\ninto a campaign for \"The Superb<br />\nHancock;\" the Superb was narrowly<br />\ndefeated. Cleveland edged Blaine and<br />\nthen lost in the Electoral College to<br />\n<br />\nBenjamin Harrison, perhaps the most<br />\ncolorless of all Presidents. Twice since<br />\nthen, the wildly exciting Bryan had<br />\nbeen convincingly beaten by the sedate<br />\nMcKinley.<br />\nConservative Transports<br />\nThe Parker campaign did not<br />\napologize for its hero's conservatism; it<br />\ngloried in it. Cleveland contributed a<br />\nmagazine sketch of Parker in which the<br />\nword \"conservative\" is a refrain, and<br />\none comes to anticipate its use as one<br />\ndoes Poe's use of \"Nevermore.\"<br />\n(Incidentally, magazine sketches of<br />\nRoosevelt were usually handled by<br />\nSenator Henry Cabot Lodge.)<br />\nJust four years before, in the<br />\nrematch of McKinley and Bryan, the<br />\nvote had been for \"safe and sane\"<br />\nleadership. By the alchemy of<br />\nassassination, the Democrats were<br />\nputting forth Parker in the role held by<br />\nrecent winning Republicans and by the<br />\nlast Democrat to be elected President.<br />\nThe Democratic candHates were not as<br />\nwell-known as those of 1884, but they<br />\ndid have grounds for expecting a close<br />\nelection.<br />\nNevertheless, it should not be<br />\ninferred that the twice-defeated Bryan<br />\nwas without influence in the campaign.<br />\nIn my next article I shall commence<br />\nconsideration of this question with an<br />\nexamination of the party platform.<br />\n<br />\n%unlit Ion Like to Start lour No library of<br />\nObscure Historical l'Iforks?

He was telling us of issues so<br />\nclear that it strikes me as almost inconceiveable that<br />\nthere are people left in this country who have souls so<br />\ndead that they can still purchase California grapes.<br />\n<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nNo, the news articles will tell you very little about<br />\nCesar Chavez. There is no room in reportage to dwell on<br />\nthe sweet intangibles of a man's personality. But travel<br />\nwith him for a short while, and you will be deeply<br />\nmoved that people like Cesar Chavez still exist in our<br />\ncountry.<br />\n<br />\nHis tone, however, is not lifeless and it is not weak.<br />\nChavez is an absolutely dedicated organizer, and he will<br />\nnot give up.\"Either the union will be destroyed,\" he has<br />\nsaid, \"or the growers will sign a contract. There's no<br />\nother alternative.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe word \"saint\" is applied loosely these days. Any<br />\nperson who doesn't beat up old ladies in the street or<br />\nrob banks can qualify for it. Chavez, though, has that<br />\ntruly gently aura of love and compassion that makes him<br />\nthe nearest thing America has to a true saint.<br />\n<br />\nYet, again, maybe I am an exception. Maybe the<br />\nspeech was not so moving as I had imagined, maybe it<br />\nwas dull and unexciting. But I do not think so. Unless<br />\nyou are deaf, it is impossible not to be touched by the<br />\nsadness in his voice and the horrors he spoke of.<br />\nPriests and Chavez<br />\nAfter the speech, to arrange an interview with<br />\nChavez, I had to divid the brief questioning time we<br />\nwere allowed between myself and some eager young<br />\nseminary students. The interview was being taped by<br />\nthem for something called Ecumedia radio.<br />\n<br />\nHe is a small man, but the mixture of Spanish and<br />\nIndian blood in him is a handsome one. He has dark,<br />\nthick hair, bronzed skin, and soft brown eyes. You can't<br />\nforget the eyes, because they are like nothing you will<br />\never see again. They are bright and deep, and they tell of<br />\na. sadness so profound and a suffering so great that we<br />\nsimply can't comprehend it. We can't really know about<br />\nscratching out a living in the endless nightmare of<br />\nmigrant farming. We cannot know, we never will know,'<br />\nbut Chavez is bringing that reality to us, reminding us of<br />\nothers we never see.<br />\nNo Fireworks<br />\n<br />\nWe crowded into a side room, and as the<br />\nphotographers took pictures, the seminary students<br />\nhovered around Chavez like the disciples around Jesus. It<br />\nis not surprising that many church people are devoted to<br />\nChavez. They see the saint in Chavez, and they love him<br />\nfor it, for he is what they all would like to become.<br />\n<br />\nHis whole manner is so totally different from any<br />\nother leader I've ever seen. Unlike Martin Luther King or<br />\nEldrige Cleaver or Malcolm X, there is no grandiose<br />\noratory. His speech is not a great cathartic mixture of<br />\npain and joy, it has none of the rich, rolling phrases,<br />\npowerful gestures, or electric atmosphere that we have<br />\nall come to expect from great crusaders.<br />\n<br />\nChavez answered our questions patiently. He told us<br />\nof the basic problems facing the workers, why he came<br />\nto Baltimore, the groups that support him, and how he<br />\nwas preparing to file suit against the Pentagon. He sat in<br />\na simple chair against the wall, and when he sopke, he<br />\nlooked into our eyes, earnestly trying to make us<br />\nunderstand the problems he knew so well.<br />\n<br />\nWhen he came on stage in Shriver Hall, he sat down<br />\nquietly next to Jim Archibald and Dr. Wickwire. He was<br />\ndressed in a green sweater, dark pants, and grey shoes.<br />\nBut the crowd stood up before this dark, poised, and<br />\nsensitive man, and applauded strongly, a passionate<br />\novation, because they sensed in their hearts that he had<br />\nworked too long to be denied whatever meager tribute<br />\nthey could give thim. The ovation lacked the usual<br />\nWhoopings and whistling, and I was glad for that. I try to<br />\nkeep up a cynical exterior, and it is not often that I<br />\nsuccumb to the mushy tides of sentiment. Yet that day I<br />\napplauded Chavez with the kind of feelings I had not<br />\nindulged in for a long time.<br />\n<br />\nTired Unions<br />\nLater, I went to a reception for him at the<br />\nSheraton-Belvedere Hotel. The leaders of the Maryland<br />\nlabor movement had paid $15 each to see Chavez. I<br />\nguess I shouldn't be cynical about their motives, for they<br />\nhad indeed pushed very hard to make the Baltimore<br />\nboycott successful. Yet they were such a tired, corrupt<br />\ngroup of aging labor leaders, with their ill-fitting suits<br />\nand pot bellies, that I felt sorry for Chavez because he<br />\nhad to deal with these people.<br />\nStanding around, wolfing down their weenies and<br />\nguzzling drinks, these men seemed unaware that Cesar<br />\nChavez was in the room. He sat quietly in the corner,<br />\nwaiting to speak, as a few burly men occasionally came<br />\nover to introduce themselves. They would swagger over,<br />\nstick out their hands with a real John Wayne<br />\nman-to-man gesture, and Chavez would slowly rise,<br />\nsmiling shyly.<br />\n<br />\nDead Souls<br />\nHe talked softly, with a trace of a Spanish accent. He<br />\nwas telling us about injustices that were so outrageous<br />\nthat he did not need to embellish his speech with<br />\nrhetorical tricks. He told us of workers being poisoned<br />\nand of a Pentagon which doubled its grape purchases in<br />\n<br />\nChavez was introduced by Nick Fornaro, a husky<br />\nman with curly grey hair. Fornaro gave Chavez the same<br />\nperfunctory introduction that he has given countless<br />\nother speakers before, at receptions no different from<br />\nthis one. Chavez came to the mike, and the small crowd<br />\nclapped politely. The fat wives with their teased hair<br />\nstood next to their husbands, and you could tell they<br />\nwere bored. Their liquor glasses shifted uncomfortably<br />\nin their hands as they waited for him to finish. Others, in<br />\nthe back of the reception room, stood in small groups,<br />\ntalking among themselves.<br />\nNo Jokes<br />\nChavez did not change to suit the crowd. He did not<br />\ntell them crude jokes to get a quick, drunken laugh, but<br />\nsopke briefly in the same soft way about the grape<br />\nworker's problems. He spoke once again of the poisoning<br />\nof workers, and the people closest to the mike smiled a<br />\nglassy-eyed grin of forced sympathy. He told them how<br />\nmuch he appreciated what they had done for him, and I<br />\nknew that he meant it.<br />\nThe next day, in front of the Food Giant<br />\nsupermarket, Chavez was just another member of ;I<br />\npicket line. There was no feverish oratory from a sound<br />\ntruck, nothing at all that would indicate that the<br />\ndark-haired man circling in the line was the Messiah to<br />\nfive million Mexican-Americans and the leader of a great<br />\nnational movement.<br />\nThe picketers were a mixed lot. Union men with<br />\nmuscle shirts walked side by side with long-haired<br />\nstudents in bell-bottoms. At the same time, a<br />\ngreasy-haired member of the American Farm Bureau, a<br />\nright-wing amalgamation of farm insurance companies<br />\nand big land owners, handed out some scurrilous<br />\nanti-Chavez literature. The man said, pointing to the<br />\npickets, \"These guys haven't tried to get the facts.<br />\nThey're just sympathetic to the cause.\"<br />\nFarm Bureau Sick<br />\nAccording to these sick men of the Farm Bureau, the<br />\nmigrant worker's life expectancy of 48 years, his hungry<br />\nchildren, and his pitiful income of $800 to $1900 a year<br />\nare mere figments of Chavez's imagination.<br />\nOne lady with mixed brown and greyish hair showed<br />\nme what Chavez is up against. As she walked out of the<br />\nsupermarket in her cheap sunglasses, with her young<br />\nblonde daughter beside her she gave an angry look at the<br />\npicketers. As she pushed her shopping cart towards her<br />\ncar, she answered my questions about the picketing and<br />\nthe grape boycott in a tight, mean voice.<br />\n\"It is just as bad as you kids demonstrating in front<br />\nof colleges, and you don't have any reason.\"<br />\nDo you plan to purchase grapes in the future?<br />\n\"I sure do!

The<br />\nemployer owns thousands of acres, and<br />\nthey literally own everything that lives<br />\nthere, grows there, and works there.<br />\nThey own the courts and they own the<br />\npolice.\"<br />\nBe cause of their power, he<br />\ncontended, the union faced difficulties<br />\nother unions these days don't have to<br />\ndeal with. \"You see, in agriculture we<br />\ndon't have any of the rules and<br />\nregulations that other unions have to go<br />\nby. We aren't covered under the<br />\nNational Labor Relations Act, we're<br />\nexcluded as workers. It's not enough for<br />\na 100% of the workers to leave the<br />\nfields to get recognized. These rules just<br />\ndon't apply.\"<br />\nYet Chavez said his union is plagued<br />\nby all the anti-union tactics that other<br />\n<br />\nunions must face\u2014including court<br />\ninjunctions and the hiring of strike<br />\nbreakers. \"The judges are absolutely<br />\nfree to enjoin every action we take. And<br />\nso the injunction is one of the best<br />\nmethods for the opposition. We have<br />\ninjunctions coming out of our ears,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nCommenting on strike-breaking, he<br />\nstated, \"It doesn't matter how many<br />\nworkers leave the field, because the<br />\nemployer can go to Mexico and get as<br />\nmany strike-breakers as he needs. They<br />\nbecome the pawns of the employers to<br />\nbe used against their brothers in the<br />\nstrike in Delano.\"<br />\nIn response to a question after the<br />\nspeech, he added, \"The moment we<br />\nstrike, hordes of these people go across<br />\nthe border to break our strike. We can't<br />\nget the government to enforce the rules,<br />\nand, of course, there is very little hope<br />\nin the life of this administration.\"<br />\nPrior to his speech, a representative<br />\nof the Maryland Farm Bureau handed<br />\nout anti-grape boycott literature outside<br />\nShriver Hall. During his talk, Chavez<br />\nvehemently attacked the Farm Bureau.<br />\n\"In America for many years,\" he,<br />\ncharged, \"the Farm Bureau has done a<br />\ngood job of opposing any legislation<br />\nthat's going to benefit the workers.<br />\nThey \u2022 also implanted in the minds of<br />\nthe American people that all the farmers<br />\n<br />\nare small land-holders. That's not true.<br />\nand it hasn't been true in California for<br />\nmany years. You can go miles and miles<br />\nwithout seeing any homes, save the<br />\nshacks that the workers live in.\"<br />\nWhy Boycott?<br />\nThe problems his union faced in the<br />\nfield prompted him, he said, to turn to a<br />\nnew tactic\u2014a nationwide grape boycott.<br />\n\"We know we can't beat the employers<br />\nin Delano in the fields, but we know,<br />\nbecause we've already gotten some<br />\nemployers to sign contracts, that if we<br />\ncan get thousands and thousands of<br />\npeople throughout the country involved<br />\nin boycotting, that this will surely bring<br />\nus victory.\"<br />\nChavez said that Baltimore had one<br />\nof the most successful grape boycotts in<br />\nthe country. He noted that grape sales<br />\nwere down 40% from last year, and that<br />\nthe city went from 12th to 27th in<br />\ngrape purchases.<br />\nThe boycott is progressing very well,<br />\nChavez indicated. \"When the growers<br />\nbegan to condemn the students for the<br />\nhelp they're giving us, we know the<br />\nstudents are having some effect. When<br />\nthey begin to condemn the labor<br />\nunions, we know the labor unions are<br />\nhaving some effect. But when they<br />\nbegin to condemn the churches for<br />\nhelping us, we know we're on the right<br />\ntrack.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Pentagon has doubled its<br />\npurchases of grapes in an attempt to<br />\nbreak the strike, he charged. The<br />\nPentagon, he observed, has increased<br />\ngrape shipments to Vietnam by 350%.<br />\nThe Defense Department's comment on<br />\nthe matter, he said, was, \"There has<br />\nbeen a routine craving for grapes by the<br />\nsoldiers in Vietname.\" Chavez declared,<br />\n\"If the Pentagon was not buying the<br />\ngrapes and feeding the soldiers in<br />\nVietnam an average of eight pounds per<br />\nman, we would've won the strike a long<br />\ntime ago.\"<br />\nOpposition Weapons<br />\nHe added, \"We're not asking for any<br />\nspecial favors, all we want to do is make<br />\nthe fight equal. Let us meet with the<br />\ngrowers, and we'll take care of<br />\nourselves. But when you bring in the<br />\nArmy, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and<br />\nall the services it's very difficult. We<br />\ndon't have a Vietcong. But we have the<br />\nstudents, labor, church people, and a lot<br />\nof good people throughout the country,<br />\nand they aren't going to stand for this.\"<br />\nConcluding, Chavez said to the<br />\naudience,\"I want to ask you to continue<br />\nfighting with us and doing all the things<br />\nthat are necessary so that we may be<br />\nable, someday, to celebrate a victory<br />\nthat is going to get the farmworkers out<br />\nof the bonds of poverty.\"<br />\n<br />\nWE<br />\nETTER<br />\nORR<br />\nMON<br />\n<br />\n(<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nWORE.<br />\nScab OraPes<br />\nf;y00.42<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nTOtE<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\nAfter he spoke at Hopkins, Chevez attended a fund-raising party at the Sheraton-Belvedere<br />\nHotel, attended largely by important members of the Maryland labor movement.

Despite much rhetoric about peace<br />\nand the few taken steps toward de-escalation<br />\nproduced by the Nixon Administration, the<br />\nimpression is growing that our government has<br />\nnot decisively changed the discredited war<br />\npolicies of the previous administration.<br />\nPerceptive journalists, like Tom Wicker,<br />\nincreasingly report that Nixon's immediate goal<br />\nis not to end the war but to defuse domestic<br />\nopposition in order to gain more time for<br />\nnegotiating a peace on terms acceptable to the<br />\nAdministration. We do not agree with the<br />\nmorality or the intelligence of this strategy.<br />\nWe believe that maximum pressure should be<br />\napplied here at home to persuade the President<br />\nthat the immediate withdrawal of American<br />\ntroops from Vietnam is in the best interests of<br />\nAmerica and Vietnam.

In any case,<br />\nbefore any guilt has been proved, police agencies are<br />\nrounding up the Panthers in the most bizarre of ways<br />\nimaginable.<br />\nChairman Bobby Seale was picked up most recently.<br />\nLeaving a wedding in Oakland, police grabbed Seale and<br />\nbrought him to the San Francisco City Jail. His charge<br />\nwas the same as the other 14 now arrested in the case:<br />\nmurder, kidnapping, conspiracy to commit muder and<br />\nconspiracy to kidnap. The FBI is hosting this treasure<br />\nhunt.<br />\nOthers were arrested in New Haven, Denver, Salt<br />\nLake City and Los Angeles. The testimony of an FBI<br />\n\"informer\" black-man George Sams; is the thin strand of<br />\nevidence used by the FBI for these mass arrests. Sams<br />\ntestified that it took the whole central committee of the<br />\nPanthers to OK the alleged execution of Rackley.<br />\n<br />\nLOS ANGELES\u2014(CPS) The Black Panther<br />\nParty is being slowly, carefully, but very<br />\nassuredly erdicated. The highly-organized<br />\nprocess that is eliminating all the top leaders is<br />\nin full swing. Whether it is conscious or not, it si<br />\nindicative that the status quo has the unnerving<br />\nability to strangle anything that threatens it.<br />\nThere are now, at least, 46 top party officials,<br />\nincluding chairman Bobby Seale, under arrest<br />\nfrom New Haven to Los Angeles, They are being<br />\nheld on bail that exceeds two million dollars.<br />\nEven if the charges on the Panthers are real (which is<br />\nhighly suspect)\u2014even were the bail somehow justified,<br />\neven if they are all truly guilty, wouldn't the number of<br />\narrests of prestigious officials alone draw the attention<br />\nof the press? So it seems. But while Dave and Chet and<br />\nWalter and Eric content themselves with discussions<br />\nabout other political groups such as the Mobe, the<br />\nPresidio 27 or the Milwaukee 14, the press has refused to<br />\ndeal with the Panthers. Thus, the story of their very real<br />\noppression goes unknown\u2014and the blatant attempts to<br />\nanihiliate them extra-legally flourish without criticism.<br />\nThe Black Panther Movement is apparently so<br />\nthreatening it must be fought with out greatest weapon:<br />\nignoring it. By totally ignoring this revolution we are<br />\npretending, if not promulgating, an environment in<br />\nwhich it just doesn't exist. And this makes a convenient<br />\ntime for government officials to dispense with the party<br />\nall together.<br />\n<br />\nWhat maeks the situation particularly suspect is the<br />\nmethod in which FBI agents are rounding up the top<br />\nofficials; Scale's case is typical. Normally, extradition<br />\nproceedings would be necessary for transporting Seale to<br />\nNew Haven, where he would face trial. But several days<br />\nafter holding him in jail without bond, FBI men \"swept\"<br />\nSeale away by car to Chicago, where, all of a sudden he<br />\nwas implicated with the other resisters now facing trial<br />\n<br />\nRevised Bus Schedule<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students, new and old, eat at:<br />\n<br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\n<br />\nThere is a revision in the<br />\nGoucher-Hopkins bus service,<br />\neffective Monday October 6,<br />\n1969.<br />\nThe bus stops at Van Meter<br />\nHall at Goucher and Levering<br />\nHall at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nfor the finest italian food in town<br />\n<br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nSPAGNETTI MEALS<br />\nPIZZA Po A SPECIALTY<br />\n<br />\nin Chicago for inciting to riot during the Chicago<br />\nconvention. This federal charge made it unnecessary for<br />\nagents to file extradition papers. After the Chicago trials,<br />\nwhere Seale will undoubtedly be cleared, it will be no<br />\nproblem for the FBI to transport him east instead of<br />\nwest. And New Haven will no doubt be an appropriate<br />\nmotel stop for the weary drivers. There Seale will be<br />\napprehended by local police.<br />\nThe \"national\" plan is alleged to come from J. Edgar<br />\nHoover. The OK to transport Seale by car, as reported<br />\nby CBS news, allegedly came from Supreme Court<br />\nJustice William 0. Douglas. This is all compouded by<br />\nBerkeley Police Chief Bruce Baker's fumbling of a plan<br />\nhe devised for \"annihiliating the party's national office,\"<br />\nthe news of which fell into hands of reporters.(By the<br />\nway, the attention given Baker's plan was minimal,<br />\nbecause reporters felt it was too clumsily conceived. It<br />\nwas.)<br />\nHarassment of top offices in Chicago and Los Angeles<br />\ncontinues. The most frequent Situation engages police in<br />\n\"shoort-outs\" with Panthers inside offices where it is<br />\ncommon knowledge Panthers store arms.<br />\nIn Chicago, police barged into Panther offices where<br />\nthe Breakfast for Children program was underway. The<br />\nseveral dozen children were being fed when police,<br />\narmed, ordered them to leave. Shooting began. Sixteen<br />\nPanthers were arrested.

Originally, the GSO<br />\nconstitution had allowed for the<br />\nappointment of various members of the<br />\nGSO to the standing committees of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe Graduate Council of the GSO<br />\nmet on Sept. 16, and nominated<br />\nmembers of the GSO for appointment<br />\nto the various University standing<br />\ncommittees. On Sept. 18, the Graduate<br />\nBoard approved the nominations.<br />\nAt last night's meeting, the GSO<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\nvoted in favor of the creation of a<br />\nUniversity Senate. It plans, however, to<br />\ndraw up its own blueprints for the<br />\nbody.<br />\nNominations were also made to the<br />\ncommittee on Student Relations and<br />\nthe newly-formed Medical Planning and<br />\nDevelopment committee. At the present<br />\ntime, there are two members of the<br />\nGSO on each of nine standing<br />\nUniversity committees.<br />\nThe Graduate Student Organization<br />\nwas formed last spring and the officers<br />\nand representatives were elected last<br />\nMay. At that time, Cotter stated that he<br />\nwould, \"work toward having some one<br />\non the Academic Cpuncil next year<br />\n('69-`70).\" Cotter also stated that he<br />\nhoped for Greater cooperation between<br />\ngraduates and undergraduate students,<br />\nand representation of graduate students<br />\non all standing committees of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nLate last week, Cotter stated that<br />\n\"undergraduates take such a secondary<br />\nrole. I'd like to see that role defined. I'd<br />\nlike to support John (Meaning John<br />\nGuess, president of the Student<br />\nCouncil).<br />\nCotter stated that he hoped to see<br />\n<br />\nthe GSO force the University to take a<br />\ndefined position on issues such as black<br />\nstudent enrollment, and the University's<br />\nrelation to the community.<br />\nCotter also said that he was in favor<br />\nof the GSO calling for the abolition of<br />\nROTC. He would not comment on the<br />\npossibility that this would happen.<br />\nCotter noted that \"the issue isn't dead.<br />\nThere is a better chance that something<br />\nwill be done now than there was last<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nNot Much Fun<br />\nAmong other duties, the GSO is in<br />\ncharge of proposing a budget for the<br />\nGraduate Club, a social club for<br />\ngraduate students. Cotter said that he<br />\nwould be pushing for a larger budget for<br />\nthe Club as \"there is little for the<br />\ngraduate student in the way of fun.\"<br />\nMuch of the work being done by the<br />\nGSO is a continuation of work done by<br />\nlast year's Graduate Club. However, Mr.<br />\nCotter stated that this was in no way a<br />\nusurpation of the Graduate Club's<br />\npower.<br />\nDean Strider stated that the GSO<br />\nshould be a \"very positive thing\" and an<br />\n\"articulate, responsible part of the<br />\nprocess.\"<br />\n<br />\n10i/K 13,4/ U.<br />\nWORLD SERIES<br />\nG I LETTE ADJUSTABLE<br />\nRAZOR<br />\n$1.95<br />\n<br />\n:41/4<br />\n<br />\n****<br />\nUNIVERSITY ONE<br />\nCOFFEE SHOP<br />\nFEATURING:<br />\n<br />\nDoug Taylor<br />\ngot his B.S. degree<br />\nin Electronics Engineering<br />\nIn 1967.<br />\nDoug is already a senior associate<br />\nengineer in Advanced Technology at<br />\nIBM.His job: designing large-scale<br />\nintegrated circuits that will go into<br />\ncomputers five to ten years from now.<br />\nThe challenge of LSI<br />\n\"Most of today's computers,\"Doug<br />\npoints out,\"use hybrid integrated<br />\ncircuits.

This unsung hero is<br />\nRandolph Boone Miller.<br />\nRandy, who wears number 3 on his white jersey, is the Blue Jay<br />\nkicking specialist. Against Muhlenberg he went four for four (one<br />\nfield goal from twenty-two yards out and three extra points). His<br />\nfield go:II from a somewhat difficult angle off to the left of the<br />\ngoalposts proved to be the winning margin. Randy, noted for the<br />\nobscurity of his puns, might have called it a \"Boone Boom\".<br />\nInjured Player Soccer<br />\nThe week before the Muhlenberg game \"Boone\" fell victim to the<br />\ninjury jinx that seems to plague this year's gridders. His shoulder,<br />\nseparation, however, came on the soccer field. Yet, except for one<br />\nday when he practiced his-kicking technique with his right arm in a<br />\nsling, this injury did not seem to detract from his ability.<br />\nAlthough he might be forced to miss several games due to his<br />\nresponsibilities as one of Coach Knauff's star halfbacks, expect to<br />\nsee number 3 kicking a lot more extra points and field goals for the<br />\nBlue Jays this fall. Both of Bachur's records are definitely within<br />\nBoone's range. And who knows? Maybe even Ed Winsten will be able<br />\nto find space in his article for Randy outside the small print of the<br />\nscoring column.<br />\nRifle Team<br />\nThe least publicized Varsity sport at Johns Hopkins is<br />\nundoubtedly the highly successful Rifle Team, which is open to any<br />\nexperienced undergraduate marksman on the Homewood campus.<br />\nLast year':- Blue Jay shooters finished with an 8-3 won-lost record<br />\nwhich was good enough to place them thirtieth of 264 teams in<br />\nnational standings.<br />\nIn collegiate rifle competition, a shooter fires at a 10x12 inch<br />\ntarget sheet from a distance of 50 feet with a .22 caliber rifle. There<br />\nare ten individual targets on this sheet. These targets are about Hi<br />\ninches in diameter, and are graded inward from one point on the<br />\nouter circle to ten points at the bullseye.<br />\nAn individual shooter gets ten shots at each target sheet (one for<br />\neach individual target) from three positions, (prone, kneeling, and<br />\nstanding), for a total of three target sheets and thirty shots in all.<br />\nThe firer is aliowed unlimited practice shots as long as he co.npletes<br />\nrecorded fire in 36 minutes. The highest score obtainable is 300.<br />\nThe 1969-70 JHU Rifleman are captained by Senior Paul E.<br />\nSchoen. Contact Paul Schoen at box 335 for further information or<br />\nif you are interested in shooting for the Johns Hopkins Team.

Paul Weiss<br />\nplunged from the two yard line for the score<br />\nonly four minutes into the game.<br />\nThe Blue Jays monopolized control of the ball<br />\nfor the first half. Bob Pfeifer had eight<br />\ncompleted passes in ten attempts for 120 yards,<br />\nwith plenty of time from his offensive line to<br />\nconnect with Steve Latson, Bill Donovan, and<br />\nflanker Dave Pickall. Especially effective was<br />\nsix-foot-four, 220-pound Latson who broke<br />\nthrough the tackles of the small Muhlenberg<br />\ndefenders after his five receptions. One of those<br />\nreceptions went for a touchdown. Paul Weiss,<br />\n<br />\nHenry Robey, and Steve Hata mobilized the<br />\nrunning for the Jays picking up 126 yards in the<br />\nentire game.<br />\nDefense Decisive<br />\nThe Hopkins defense, however, proved to be<br />\nthe decisive factor in the game. Hopkins back<br />\nDave Nolan picked off two of Randy Ulrich's<br />\npasses to Muhlenberg receivers. The defensive<br />\nsquad recovered three Mule fumbles. The Blue<br />\nJay line's constant pressure on Mule quarterback<br />\nRandy Ulrich took its toll: Ulrich completed<br />\nonly 46 percent of his passes and was dumped<br />\nbehind the line of scrimmage five times for<br />\nsizable losses.<br />\nThe Mules' lone score in the first hafl came<br />\nafter Pfiefer fumbled on Hopkins' ten yard line.<br />\nTwo minutes before, the Jay defense stopped the<br />\nMules two yards away from a touchdown. Randy<br />\nUlrich finally went to the air from six yards out<br />\nto get a touchdown.<br />\nIn the second half, Bob Pfiefer and his speedy<br />\nflanker Dave Pickall demonstrated the<br />\ndevastating passing attack of the Blue Jays..<br />\nPickall caught two touchdown passes and gained<br />\n120 yards in the second half.

They jointly drafted<br />\nthe petition and were able to<br />\nprocure the signatures of 372<br />\nFreshmen.<br />\nActually, two petitions were<br />\nwritten by the four. The first,<br />\nwhich was strongly worded,<br />\nstated that all Freshmen should<br />\nsign who believed P.E. to be<br />\n\"boring, meaningless, stupid,<br />\nand completely irrelevant\" to<br />\ntheir college education. This<br />\npetition did not receive the<br />\nresponse, which Weiss, and<br />\nSeigel, the two initiators of the<br />\nmovement, had expected.<br />\nInstead, they wrote a new<br />\npetit ion, toiling down its<br />\n'wording to say that P.E. should<br />\nbe made voluntary for freshmen.<br />\nliven though 372 Frosh<br />\nsigned, the four agreed that if a<br />\nfreshmen student would not sign<br />\nr iim, in almost all<br />\n<br />\ncases, he would not sign the<br />\nsecond. It can be concluded<br />\nthen, that most all of the 372<br />\nsigners didn't want P.E. to begin<br />\nwith.<br />\nMeet With Swanson<br />\nLast Friday the four met with<br />\nDean Carl Swanson.

On the \u00b0the,<br />\nhand, the Colonel said thdt<br />\nwhether P.E. is made voluntary<br />\nor not, makes 110 difference to<br />\nhim, however he felt that many<br />\nboys would not exercise or be<br />\nactive without P.E. Also, it<br />\nrepresents another opportunity<br />\nto meet new friends.<br />\nThis reporter also interviewed<br />\nvarious Freshmen students, most<br />\nof whom signed the petition.<br />\nThe general concensus, as stated<br />\nby freshmen Les Mechaelson, is<br />\nthat because there are no<br />\nmandatory courses at Hopkins,<br />\nit should not be made a<br />\nrequirement for freshmen to<br />\nattend P.E. classes. Another<br />\nfrosh opinion which concurred<br />\nwith Michaelson's was made by<br />\nLen Pugatch who believed that if<br />\na student feels it necessary to<br />\npartake in athletics, he will do so<br />\nwhether it be mandatory or not.<br />\nTherefore, P.E. should be made<br />\nstrictly voluntary. \u201e \u2022<br />\n\"MAP<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCT 3, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 19<br />\n<br />\nSPORTS<br />\nStrong First Game Victory Football Centenary Marked<br />\nRaises Championship Hopes By Eulogy To Ted Straus<br />\n(Continued from page 18)<br />\n<br />\nhis man and raced 58 yards to the goal.<br />\nThat gave the Blue Jays a 20-8 lead.

Speaking before a large\u2022<br />\ncrowd in Shriver Hall, the head of<br />\nthe<br />\nUnited<br />\nFarm<br />\nWorkers'<br />\nOrganizing Committee spoke of<br />\nproblems facing the striking grape<br />\nworkers and the \u2022 nationwide<br />\nboycott of California table grapes.<br />\nThe grape strike in the<br />\nCalifornia town of Delano has<br />\nlasted for four years, and the<br />\nconsumer boycott has been going<br />\n.on for 16 months.

We<br />\nknow that its only a matter of time<br />\nbefore the employers, like so many<br />\nemployers in the past, are forced to<br />\nrecognize the workers and their right to<br />\nhave a union.\"<br />\n<br />\n(havez, however, did not hesitate in<br />\ndetailing the difficulties his union faced.<br />\nSome of the difficulties he presented<br />\nincluded his union's lack of coverage<br />\nunder the National Labor Relations Act;<br />\nthe extensive use of injunctions against<br />\nthe union; the widespread hiring of<br />\nMexican immigrants to break the strike;<br />\nand the doubling of grape purchases for<br />\nthe military by the Pentagon.<br />\nCh avez's speech signalled new<br />\nemphasis on the health and safety of the<br />\nvineyard workers. \"The issue of<br />\npestiscide poisoning is more important<br />\nthan wages, even though wages may be<br />\nas lousy as they are,\" he declared. The<br />\nMexican-American leader charged that<br />\nthe lack of protection for the grape<br />\nworkers was resulting in their<br />\n\"systematic poisoning.\"<br />\n\"The evidence of the last five years,\"<br />\nhe said, \"shows that almost all grape<br />\nworkers suffer from some sort of<br />\npoisoning sympton -fever, skin rash,<br />\nvomiting, nose-bleeding, headaches, eye<br />\nirritation, and vision impairment.\"<br />\nSafety Proposals<br />\nChavez talked about his recent<br />\nattempts to get the Federal Mediation<br />\nService to re-open negotiations between<br />\nthe growers and his union, but he<br />\nasserted that he would not compromise<br />\non worker safety.

An immediate ban on DDT.<br />\n2. Stringent control of \"hard\"<br />\npestiscides such as Aldrin.<br />\n3. A committee to determine by<br />\nactural scientific testing at what period<br />\nof time after spraying it is reasqbably<br />\nsafe for workers to go back info the<br />\nfield.<br />\n<br />\n4.

The<br />\n\"base<br />\nis the danger point for<br />\npestiscide poisoning .<br />\nSpeaking in a soft, low-keyed voice,<br />\nChavez said, \"We're not asking for too<br />\nmuch. The employers can work with all<br />\nthese restrictions we want. They can<br />\nharvest, they can cultivate, they can<br />\nproduce perfectly healthy grapes<br />\nwithout the use of DDT.

At a previous meeting,<br />\nthe council voted support for the Hopkins ad<br />\nhoc committee for the Vietnam Moratorium.<br />\nThe new resolution condemns the \"continued<br />\ninvolvement of the United States in Vietnam\"<br />\nand endorses the \"proposal by Senator Charles<br />\nGoodell of New York calling for a withdrawal of<br />\nall United States forces from Vietnam by the<br />\nend of 1979.Faculty Support<br />\nThe SC also called upon the _faculty of the<br />\nUniversity \"to support the Vietnam Moratorium<br />\nby cancelling all classes on October 15.\" Eleven<br />\nfaculty members had already begun to circulate<br />\na letter and petition of support for the<br />\nMoratorium.<br />\nThe resolution, introduced by junior class<br />\nrepresentative Bill Betcher, pointed out that the<br />\npresidents of Rutgers 'University and the<br />\nUniversity of Michigan have already called for<br />\nschool-wide participation in the Moratorium at<br />\ntheir respective schools. The resolution<br />\nencouraged the Hopkins administration to take<br />\nsimilar steps by saying \"in view of the<br />\nimportance of this day both for the University<br />\nand for the entire country, we feel that the<br />\nUniversity has an obligation to particpate in the<br />\nobservance of the Moratorium.\"<br />\nIn a statement released on September 30, Dr.<br />\nGordon responded to the SC resolution passed<br />\nthe day before. The President cited a letter he<br />\nhad written on March 21, 1968 to a faculty<br />\nmember who had requested that the University<br /><br />\nbe closed down for the \"Academic Days of<br />\nConscience.\" In that letter he denied the request<br />\nbecause, \"In substance. .. several of your<br />\nsuggestions, including the suspension of regular<br />\nclasses ... would imply the adoption of an<br />\nofficial, institutional, University position in<br />\nrelation to the war.\"<br />\nThe letter continues,\"... Johns Hopkins has<br />\nalways maintainerl an exceptionally liberal<br />\nattitude towards the expression of views on<br />\nmatters of public interest and concern by all<br />\nmembers of the University community. There is<br />\nno inhibition on individual or organized<br />\nmanifestations of opinion, so long as they do<br />\nnot impair the freedom of others orinterfere<br />\nwith the normal functioning of the University.\"<br />\n\"Constrained\"<br />\n\"On the other hand,\" wrote Dr. Gordon,<br />\n\"the University has never adopted an official<br />\ninstitutional position on controverted public<br />\nissues, and I believe that it would be most<br />\nundesirable for it to do so. Members of the<br />\ncommunity, whether a majority or a minority,<br />\nwho differed from the 'official position'<br />\nwould inevitably feel constrained by its very<br />\nannouncement.'<br />\nPresident Gordon did state that although the<br />\nadministration would not support the<br />\nMoratorium it would not prohibit to members<br />\nof the University community participation in its<br />\nactivities. The President's statement reads<br />\n\"... this conclusion in no way prevents<br />\nindividual students, faculty members,<br />\nadministrators, or groupings of them to make<br />\ncrystal clear their opinions on policy concerning<br />\nthe warm n Vietnam or any other issue.\" Dr.<br />\nGordon also indicates that \"The freedom of<br />\nstudents to attend particular classes or not on an<br />\nindividual voluntary basis is equally well<br />\nestablished.\"<br />\nThe President's statement says, \"Institutional<br />\nuniversity positions on matters of public policy<br />\nnot directly affecting the academic enterprise<br />\nare simply not compatible with the intransigent<br /><br />\nhe by<br /><br />\ndefense of academic freedom, a cause which this<br />\nUniversity has consistently defended since its<br />\nvery foundation.\"<br />\nPersonal Views<br />\nExplaining his personal views of the war in<br />\nVietnam Dr. Gordon cited a personal requrest<br />\nfrom President Lyndon Johnson in March, 1968<br />\nfor his opinions on the war. Dr. Gordon said, \"I<br />\nstated clearly my opinion that the decisions<br />\nmade in 1954, 1961, and 1965 (by Eisenhower,<br />\nKennedy and Johnson respectively) had been<br />\nmistaken. I recommended a policy of prompt<br />\nde-Americanization of the militaty and<br />\n'pacification' efforts and a broader political base<br />\nfor the government in Saigon.\" President<br />\nGordon points out that coincidentally his views<br />\nare \"parallel to Defense Secretary Clifford's<br />\nproposals as he related them in Foreign Affairs<br />\nlast July.\"<br />\nPresident Gordon sees some efforts in this<br />\ndirection, but considers them to be \"too small<br />\nand too halting.\" Even considering the state of<br />\nthe war today Dr. Gordon does not think that<br />\nunilateral withdrawal is the best course.\"If I did<br />\nbelieve so, I would want it done much more<br />\nrapidly than the fifteen months suggested in<br />\nSenator Goodell's resolution.\"<br />\n\"Moral Obligation\"<br />\nThe President sees the possibility for a<br />\npolitical settlement as not \"wholly unrealizable,<br />\nwithin a short time period.\" He also believes<br />\nthat the United States has a \"moral obligation in<br />\nany circumstances to provide for the safety of<br />\nindividuals in South Vietnam who have relied on<br />\nour commitments \u2014 however unwisely<br />\nmade \u2014 in recent years.\"<br />\nDr. Gordon discussed his statement with<br />\nBetcher and Manuel Rodriguez, another SC<br />\nmember strongly supporting the resolution,<br />\nbefore releasing it to the press.<br />\nRodrigues criticized the statement saying,\"I<br />\ncan see how from his position Gordon's logic<br />\n(Continued on page 15)<br /><br />\nA...<br /><br />\n\u00a3A A&amp; A.Ati.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD.

The Council, Kimball<br />\npredicted, will appoint a study group<br />\nwhich in turn will select a second<br />\ncommittee charged to draft a proposal<br />\nfor reforms in the University's<br />\ngovernance procedures. Kimball said<br />\nthat this second group should include<br />\nundergraduate and graduate students.<br />\nThe Academic Council's discussions<br />\nlast Wednesday were prompted by a<br />\nreport presented by Dr. M.

Miss Davis, an avowed American<br />\ncommunist, announced last Monday<br />\nthat she would challenge the decision in<br />\nthe courts.<br />\nThe firing is the first implementation<br />\nsince 1950 of a 1940 bylaw forbidding<br />\ncommunists to teach on the California<br />\ncampuses. The action is remarkably<br />\nsimilar to the State Board of Trustees'<br />\naction last year at this time when they<br />\nvoted to fire George Murray, a Black<br />\nPanther instructor, from San Francisco<br />\nState. The firing led to demonstrations<br />\nand the massive student strikes which<br />\nplagued the campus throughout most of<br />\nthe year.<br />\nProtest Expected<br />\nThe UCLA campus was expected to<br />\nerupt in protest upon release of the<br />\nannouncement, but the various groups<br />\nwhich had threatened violence<br />\napparently decided to wait fl), the<br />\noutcome of preliminary court<br />\nproceedings before acting.

It is not expected that the<br />\ncommittee, however, will overturn the<br />\nRegents' rulings. Even if it does, the<br />\nPresident can still veto their actions.<br />\nBehind the Scenes<br />\nBoth this year's and last year's firings<br />\nwere engineered by Governor Ronald<br />\nReagan who has repeatedly demanded<br />\nMiss Davis' firing in- several recent<br />\nspeeches.

Sources in<br />\nSacramento say the decision has the full<br />\nbacking of both Reagan and Chancellor<br />\nCharles E. Young.<br />\nThe Governor claims that the firing<br />\naction does not contradict an earlier<br />\ndecision this year by the Regents which<br />\nvowed that no university would<br />\ndiscriminate in its hiring practices<br />\nbecause of the political affiliation of<br />\npotential staff. \"Her allegiance is<br />\nobviously to another country,\" he said,<br />\nnoting that the U.S. Attorney General<br />\nhas ruled the communist' party<br />\nsubVerSiVe.<br />\n\u2022,<br /><br />\nprinciple of pluralistic ignorance is in<br />\nplay, that \"everyone thinks everyone<br />\nelse is using it.\"<br />\nHogan said he is \"bored with the<br />\nharassment\" he receives from people<br />\nfeeling the study of 148 people cannot<br />\nprovide adequate statistics for the group<br />\nin question.

The teachers are not<br />\nteachers in the Mr. Chips sense of the<br />\nword, but are interested people whose<br />\nonly qualification is a sincere desire to<br />\naid in the communication and<br />\nissemination of ideas among a group.

However, this<br />\ndiscrepancy is explainable. Gordon<br />\nstated. He said that IQ tests- in early<br />\nchildhood are concerned more with<br />\nmotor nerve responses than abstract<br />\nreasoning. \"It has been found that<br />\nNegroes mature more quickly in early<br />\nchildhood than white,\" he maintained.<br />\n\"Therefore their scores go down in the<br />\nlater, more abstract tests.<br />\nThe effects of nutrition on a child's<br />\nnative abilities were mentioned by all<br />\nthe professors and in the text of the<br />\nJensen article.

Dr.<br />\nJacobson', however, asserted that only in<br />\nvery extreme cases would nutrition play<br />\na part in a child's mental acumen. He<br />\ncited IQ tests taken in the Philippines<br />\nand other places in the Far East which<br />\nplaced Asian children on the same level<br />\nwith white IQ scores despite their<br />\nimproverished conditions.<br />\nStatistical Evidence<br />\nThe statistics from the Jensen report<br />\nand other surveys indicate that only<br />\nfifteen per cent of the black population<br />\nreaches or exceeds the white norm of<br />\n100 points. Likewise, Negroes<br />\ndisproportionately occupy the bottom<br />\nend of the IQ scale. Only two per cent<br />\nof black high school students receive<br />\ngrades over 500 on the SAT verbal and<br />\nmath tests as compared to about 28 per<br />\ncent of the whites. Blacks, however,<br />\nhave tested relatively better than their<br />\nwhite counterparts -in associative, oi<br />\nrote, learning.<br />\nThese and other statistics have led<br />\nDr. Jacobson to delcarc that a black<br />\ngenius is a rarity. Dr. Gordon also used<br />\nthis evidence to observe that the dearth<br />\nof black students and professors at the<br />\nnation's top ranked colleges and<br />\nuniversities is due to the Negro's lower<br />\ncognitive ability, not discriminatory<br />\nselection procedures. He concluded that<br />\nHopkins should statistically have a two<br />\nper cent black faculty.<br />\n(Hopkins has amassed a three per<br />\ncent black ratio on campus.)<br />\nDr. Gordon also completely agreed<br />\nwith C.P. Snow's statement last spring<br />\nthat the Jews are genetically superior to<br />\ngentiles. \"Yes, the Jews have an average<br />\nIQ of 108, that's why they do so well,\"<br />\nGordothln concluded.

Lincoln Gordon has done it again this time with two nearly<br />\nincredible quotes about the Viet Nam moratorium. First, Dr. Gordon<br />\nstated that the moratorium is not an effective means of protesting the war.<br />\nWhether or not this is true remains to be answered by the events of the<br />\nnext several months. What is objectionable is that Dr. Gordon cited this as<br />\na reason for not lending Hopkins' support to the moratorium effort.<br />\nIt is as if Gordon does not want to sully the name of Hopkins by having<br />\nit associated with an effort which is not effective . He obviously does not<br />\nsee the war as anything particularly odious odious enough so that any<br />\nlegal effort to end it is worthy of support. Certainly, Dr. Gordon is<br />\nentitled to this view as his personal opinion on the war. However, in his<br />\nPosition of spokesman and executive for the university, he should not be<br />\nafforded the luxury of enforcing his opinion on the university as an<br />\ninstitution. The silence from Hopkins on the moratorium amounts to<br />\nnothing less than tacit complicity with the protracted war and rejection of<br />\nthe peace movement.<br />\nIn light of this, Dr. Gordon's second statement becomes almost<br />\nlaughable. He says that he does not think it proper for the university to<br />\ntake a stand on political issues. The fact that he has made his own<br />\npreference for non-compliance with the moratorium the university's stand<br />\ndoes not seem to phase him in the least.<br />\n. Moreover, in his attempt to leave the university uncommitted and<br />\nirreproachable, our President has neglected one fact which negates his<br />\nentire argument. The university took a stand more than 25 years ago, with<br />\nthe creation of the Applied Physics Laboratory. The APL sparked the<br />\nNavy's interest in atomic research and contributed to the creation of the<br />\natom bomb.(But that was during World War II, when everyone thought it<br />\nwas in service to America). During the next decade, Hopkins<br />\nresearchers developed the Tabs, Tartar and Terrier missles for the Navy.<br />\nToday, Hopkins checks out every Polaris missile submarine for the Navy's<br />\nFleet Ballistic Missile Program.

Many will feel that they should<br />\ngo to class either on principle or for pragmatic reasons, even though they<br />\nwould like to register their non-support of the war and their sympathy<br />\nWith the moratorium.<br />\nThis choice should have been eliminated by Hopkins' closing for the<br />\nday.

Then there is the<br />\n\"credibility gap\" shot, wherein the camera cuts from<br />\nsomeone's dialogue to an action or setting which<br />\nridicules what that person has just said.<br />\nRavenous Cheering<br />\nIn this movie the background becomes the<br />\nforeground. The story is overshadowed by a larger One,<br />\nAmerica at the end of the 1960's. A tale of violence and<br />\nanger, of hatred and turmoil. Wexler rewrites the lyrics<br />\nto \"America the Beautiful\" and gives us back what we<br />\ngave to history in 1968: a man dead on the floor of a<br />\nLos Angeles hotel kitchen, a man dead in a Memphis<br />\nmotel, a nation dead in the streets and parks of Chicago.<br />\nInterspersed among the peaks of history are the<br />\nplateaus of non-history that make history: the T-shirt<br />\nand curlers crowd cheering ravenously at a roller derby<br />\nspectacle, the wives of grocers and insurance salesmen<br />\nlearning the use of firearms, the black militants<br />\ndefending looting, the Saturday morning boxing session<br />\nat the CYO gym.<br />\nA violent America, the America Wexler sees. He<br />\npoints out important questions about this violence: is<br />\nthe United States really sick? Does the news media<br />\ndistort the true picture, encouraging and emphasizing<br />\nbrutality? But no answer to these unanswerable(though<br />\nvery fashionable) questions. Unlike a Godard polemic,<br />\nwe are spared the tedium of some oppressed proletarian<br />\nharanguing the bourgeoisie about what the Third World<br />\nwill do to etc. etc.<br /><br />\nOf Course The Tube<br />\nWe do have to think, though. Unlike the 11:00<br />\no'clock news, there is no Johnny Carson Show after this<br />\nmovie. The audience. has to walk out of the theatre, get<br />\ninto its cars and drive home. Then turn on the tube, of<br />\ncourse. But still, a few minutes of thought. There it was,<br />\nin full natural color, on a screen enormously larger than<br />\na TV set. No lectures, no speeches. Just the pictures.<br />\nHopefully, it is enough.<br />\nBut, of course, it is not enough. Medium Cool is a<br />\nvery, very pessimistic movie. In the most obvious(but<br />\nmost meaningful) interpretation the two central<br />\ncharacters represent average Americans, non-political<br />\nuninvolved Americans. The cameramen, who loves to<br />\nshoot film, is just doing his job (\"I gotta job ta do,just<br />\nlike evribody else.\") Except for concern for his personal<br />\nsafety, he never participates in what he photographs.<br />\nThe woman, from the God-fearin' law-abidin'<br />\ncountryside, finds herself lost and dazed in the political<br />\nviolence of Chicago in August 1968. Both remain aloof.<br />\nboth die.<br />\nEveryone Goes On<br />\nMedium Cool opens at the scene of an unexplained<br />\ncar accident. While the car burns, an anonymous man,<br />\nwalking across a nearby overpass, stares at the twisted<br />\ncorpse and wrecked automobile. He walks on. Medium<br />\nCool closes at the scene of an unexplained car accident.<br />\nA burning station wagon rests in a roadside ditch. A<br />\nfamily cruises by in an ancient Rambler, slowing down<br />\nto get a better stare and so the kid can snap the scene<br />\nwith his Instamatic. They drive on. The soundtrack<br />\nbroadcasts the screaming of demonstrating radicals, who<br />\nsay, in a chant both correct and prophetic, \"the whole<br />\nworld is watching.\"<br />\nAnd so everyone goes on, uninvolved.

Parker Club Growing<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nAt this point in the study of Alton B.<br />\nParker it is necessary to retreat twenty<br />\nyears, so that not coincidentally\u2014there<br />\nwill be a closer examination of the<br />\nprincipal advocate of Parker's election,<br />\nformer President Cleveland. The<br />\nstandard comment on the election of<br />\n1904 is that Parker was hopelessly<br />\novermatched in a personality clash with<br />\nPresident Roosevelt.<br />\nThat Roosevelt had the more<br />\nassertive personality is manifest, but the<br />\nimplicit statement that the stronger<br />\npersonality must win is of dubious<br />\nmerit. Such a rule would not account<br />\nfor Polk's defeat of Fremont or<br />\nMcKinley's defeat of Bryan. For this<br />\nstudy, it is most important that it would<br />\nnot account for Cleveland's 1884 defeat<br />\nof James G. Blaine.<br /><br />\nLeonine Pose<br />\nBlaine can be fitted with virtually<br />\nany epithet, and he has been; but there<br />\ncan be no doubt of the assertiveness of<br />\nhis personality. In photographs he is<br />\nalways striking a leonine pose, erect and<br />\nsomber, with not a whisker askew in his<br />\nmagnificent full-length beard.<br />\nHis oratorical style was in keeping<br />\nwith his personality. Blaine had a voice<br />\nof thunder, a reasonable command of<br />\nthe language and a stage presence that<br />\nwould command the envy of any<br />\nthespian. There is abundant testimony<br />\nof his \"magnetic\" quality; the current<br />\nadjective would be \"charismatic.\" In his<br />\nbest performances, Blaine had the<br />\nability to exact cheers from a hostile<br />\naudience.<br />\nIn the election of 1884, it was clear<br />\nfrom the outset that Blaine and<br />\nCleveland would be battling on the level<br />\nof personality contest. There was a<br />\nwidely diffused impression of Cleveland<br />\nwhich was antithetical to the<br />\nmarble-and-bronze impression of Blaine.<br />\nCleveland was distinctly unremarkable<br />\n.. .... . \u2022<br /><br />\nin his presence; he did weigh over 250<br />\npounds, which is somewhat remarkable,<br />\nbut he was not as attractive as Blaine.<br />\nHis writing style is prolix and uneven;<br />\nhe did show some good turns of phrase,<br />\nbut these are on the simplest level of his<br />\nlanguage. Occasionally one discovers<br />\nthat Cleveland wrote poetry. His poetry,<br />\nusually light verse, is uniformly<br />\nmiserable.<br />\nTransports of Work<br />\nObviously the authors of the<br />\nCleveland campaign literature could not<br />\nhave made him exciting. Instead, it is<br />\nstressed that he was a methodical and<br />\ndeligent worker, and that he would<br />\nnever fall behind in expediting the<br />\nWhite House paperwork. It appears that,<br />\nin his early days as a struggling lawyer in<br />\nBuffalo; Cleveland acquired the valuable<br />\nhabit of struggling until midnight and<br />\nsleeping at his desk.<br />\nIn higher office, his transports of<br />\nwork were even more impressive.<br />\nLacking the mercurial qualities of<br />\nBlaine, he became, both literally and<br />\nfiguratively, one of the solider citizens<br />\nof his community. It was at the bidding<br />\nof other solid citizens that he had been<br />\n\"up and doing\" through four years as<br />\nSheriff of Erie County,one as Mayor of<br />\nBuffalo and two as Governor of New<br />\nYork.<br />\nThere is no need to discuss the<br />\ndetails of the 1884 campaign, but it<br />\nmust be stressed that the 1904 image of<br />\nParker borrowed heavily from the 1884<br />\nimage of Cleveland. Roosevelt was not<br />\nas questionable in his ethics as Blaine<br />\nhad been, although, as we shall see,<br />\nParker eventually attempted to fashion<br />\nan issue of Roosevelt's ethics. But the<br />\nParker literature pictures Roosevelt as<br />\nimpetuous and erratic, even as the<br />\nCleveland literature of 1884 had<br />\npictured Blaine. Parker's place with<br />\nCleveland is presented even less subtly.<br /><br />\nMore Transports<br />\nParker, like Cleveland, is celebrated<br />\nfor his transports of labor. Parker, like<br />\nCleveland, is known for a devotion to<br />\nhis family, which hindered his<br />\neducation. Parker, like Cleveland, is<br />\nrenowned for his sturdy New England<br />\nextraction. Parker, like Cleveland, is<br />\ncelebrated for assimilating enormous<br />\namounts of material before reaching a<br />\ndecision. Parker, like Cleveland, is<br />\nfamous for his devotion to public<br />\nservice and his methodical, conservative<br />\napproach to problems. The two even<br />\nappear to share a taste for outdoor<br />\nrecreation.<br />\nIt is manifest that the Democrats<br />\nwere not conceding a personality battle<br />\nwith Roosevelt. The fact is that, in<br />\nelections prior to 1904, the methodical<br />\ncandidate had faced the mercurial on at<br />\nleast equal grounds. Grant admittedly<br />\nhad a dashing reputation, but he was<br />\npresented as a solid and sober executive<br />\nin two contests against notable orators.<br />\nIn 1876, both parties stressed their<br />\ncandidates' methodical application to<br />\npiles of work. In 1880 the Republicans<br />\nstressed the scholarly and methodical<br />\nmethod of James Garfield, while the<br />\nDemocrats tried to pump some color<br />\ninto a campaign for \"The Superb<br />\nHancock;\" the Superb was narrowly<br />\ndefeated. Cleveland edged Blaine and<br />\nthen lost in the Electoral College to<br /><br />\nBenjamin Harrison, perhaps the most<br />\ncolorless of all Presidents. Twice since<br />\nthen, the wildly exciting Bryan had<br />\nbeen convincingly beaten by the sedate<br />\nMcKinley.<br />\nConservative Transports<br />\nThe Parker campaign did not<br />\napologize for its hero's conservatism; it<br />\ngloried in it. Cleveland contributed a<br />\nmagazine sketch of Parker in which the<br />\nword \"conservative\" is a refrain, and<br />\none comes to anticipate its use as one<br />\ndoes Poe's use of \"Nevermore.\"<br />\n(Incidentally, magazine sketches of<br />\nRoosevelt were usually handled by<br />\nSenator Henry Cabot Lodge.)<br />\nJust four years before, in the<br />\nrematch of McKinley and Bryan, the<br />\nvote had been for \"safe and sane\"<br />\nleadership. By the alchemy of<br />\nassassination, the Democrats were<br />\nputting forth Parker in the role held by<br />\nrecent winning Republicans and by the<br />\nlast Democrat to be elected President.<br />\nThe Democratic candHates were not as<br />\nwell-known as those of 1884, but they<br />\ndid have grounds for expecting a close<br />\nelection.<br />\nNevertheless, it should not be<br />\ninferred that the twice-defeated Bryan<br />\nwas without influence in the campaign.<br />\nIn my next article I shall commence<br />\nconsideration of this question with an<br />\nexamination of the party platform.<br /><br />\n%unlit Ion Like to Start lour No library of<br />\nObscure Historical l'Iforks?

There is no room in reportage to dwell on<br />\nthe sweet intangibles of a man's personality. But travel<br />\nwith him for a short while, and you will be deeply<br />\nmoved that people like Cesar Chavez still exist in our<br />\ncountry.<br /><br />\nHis tone, however, is not lifeless and it is not weak.<br />\nChavez is an absolutely dedicated organizer, and he will<br />\nnot give up.\"Either the union will be destroyed,\" he has<br />\nsaid, \"or the growers will sign a contract. There's no<br />\nother alternative.\"<br /><br />\nThe word \"saint\" is applied loosely these days. Any<br />\nperson who doesn't beat up old ladies in the street or<br />\nrob banks can qualify for it. Chavez, though, has that<br />\ntruly gently aura of love and compassion that makes him<br />\nthe nearest thing America has to a true saint.<br /><br />\nYet, again, maybe I am an exception. Maybe the<br />\nspeech was not so moving as I had imagined, maybe it<br />\nwas dull and unexciting. But I do not think so. Unless<br />\nyou are deaf, it is impossible not to be touched by the<br />\nsadness in his voice and the horrors he spoke of.<br />\nPriests and Chavez<br />\nAfter the speech, to arrange an interview with<br />\nChavez, I had to divid the brief questioning time we<br />\nwere allowed between myself and some eager young<br />\nseminary students. The interview was being taped by<br />\nthem for something called Ecumedia radio.<br /><br />\nHe is a small man, but the mixture of Spanish and<br />\nIndian blood in him is a handsome one. He has dark,<br />\nthick hair, bronzed skin, and soft brown eyes. You can't<br />\nforget the eyes, because they are like nothing you will<br />\never see again. They are bright and deep, and they tell of<br />\na. sadness so profound and a suffering so great that we<br />\nsimply can't comprehend it. We can't really know about<br />\nscratching out a living in the endless nightmare of<br />\nmigrant farming. We cannot know, we never will know,'<br />\nbut Chavez is bringing that reality to us, reminding us of<br />\nothers we never see.<br />\nNo Fireworks<br /><br />\nWe crowded into a side room, and as the<br />\nphotographers took pictures, the seminary students<br />\nhovered around Chavez like the disciples around Jesus. It<br />\nis not surprising that many church people are devoted to<br />\nChavez. They see the saint in Chavez, and they love him<br />\nfor it, for he is what they all would like to become.<br /><br />\nHis whole manner is so totally different from any<br />\nother leader I've ever seen. Unlike Martin Luther King or<br />\nEldrige Cleaver or Malcolm X, there is no grandiose<br />\noratory. His speech is not a great cathartic mixture of<br />\npain and joy, it has none of the rich, rolling phrases,<br />\npowerful gestures, or electric atmosphere that we have<br />\nall come to expect from great crusaders.<br /><br />\nChavez answered our questions patiently. He told us<br />\nof the basic problems facing the workers, why he came<br />\nto Baltimore, the groups that support him, and how he<br />\nwas preparing to file suit against the Pentagon. He sat in<br />\na simple chair against the wall, and when he sopke, he<br />\nlooked into our eyes, earnestly trying to make us<br />\nunderstand the problems he knew so well.<br /><br />\nWhen he came on stage in Shriver Hall, he sat down<br />\nquietly next to Jim Archibald and Dr. Wickwire. He was<br />\ndressed in a green sweater, dark pants, and grey shoes.<br />\nBut the crowd stood up before this dark, poised, and<br />\nsensitive man, and applauded strongly, a passionate<br />\novation, because they sensed in their hearts that he had<br />\nworked too long to be denied whatever meager tribute<br />\nthey could give thim. The ovation lacked the usual<br />\nWhoopings and whistling, and I was glad for that. I try to<br />\nkeep up a cynical exterior, and it is not often that I<br />\nsuccumb to the mushy tides of sentiment. Yet that day I<br />\napplauded Chavez with the kind of feelings I had not<br />\nindulged in for a long time.<br /><br />\nTired Unions<br />\nLater, I went to a reception for him at the<br />\nSheraton-Belvedere Hotel. The leaders of the Maryland<br />\nlabor movement had paid $15 each to see Chavez. I<br />\nguess I shouldn't be cynical about their motives, for they<br />\nhad indeed pushed very hard to make the Baltimore<br />\nboycott successful. Yet they were such a tired, corrupt<br />\ngroup of aging labor leaders, with their ill-fitting suits<br />\nand pot bellies, that I felt sorry for Chavez because he<br />\nhad to deal with these people.<br />\nStanding around, wolfing down their weenies and<br />\nguzzling drinks, these men seemed unaware that Cesar<br />\nChavez was in the room. He sat quietly in the corner,<br />\nwaiting to speak, as a few burly men occasionally came<br />\nover to introduce themselves. They would swagger over,<br />\nstick out their hands with a real John Wayne<br />\nman-to-man gesture, and Chavez would slowly rise,<br />\nsmiling shyly.<br /><br />\nDead Souls<br />\nHe talked softly, with a trace of a Spanish accent. He<br />\nwas telling us about injustices that were so outrageous<br />\nthat he did not need to embellish his speech with<br />\nrhetorical tricks. He told us of workers being poisoned<br />\nand of a Pentagon which doubled its grape purchases in<br /><br />\nChavez was introduced by Nick Fornaro, a husky<br />\nman with curly grey hair. Fornaro gave Chavez the same<br />\nperfunctory introduction that he has given countless<br />\nother speakers before, at receptions no different from<br />\nthis one. Chavez came to the mike, and the small crowd<br />\nclapped politely. The fat wives with their teased hair<br />\nstood next to their husbands, and you could tell they<br />\nwere bored. Their liquor glasses shifted uncomfortably<br />\nin their hands as they waited for him to finish. Others, in<br />\nthe back of the reception room, stood in small groups,<br />\ntalking among themselves.<br />\nNo Jokes<br />\nChavez did not change to suit the crowd. He did not<br />\ntell them crude jokes to get a quick, drunken laugh, but<br />\nsopke briefly in the same soft way about the grape<br />\nworker's problems. He spoke once again of the poisoning<br />\nof workers, and the people closest to the mike smiled a<br />\nglassy-eyed grin of forced sympathy. He told them how<br />\nmuch he appreciated what they had done for him, and I<br />\nknew that he meant it.<br />\nThe next day, in front of the Food Giant<br />\nsupermarket, Chavez was just another member of ;I<br />\npicket line. There was no feverish oratory from a sound<br />\ntruck, nothing at all that would indicate that the<br />\ndark-haired man circling in the line was the Messiah to<br />\nfive million Mexican-Americans and the leader of a great<br />\nnational movement.<br />\nThe picketers were a mixed lot. Union men with<br />\nmuscle shirts walked side by side with long-haired<br />\nstudents in bell-bottoms. At the same time, a<br />\ngreasy-haired member of the American Farm Bureau, a<br />\nright-wing amalgamation of farm insurance companies<br />\nand big land owners, handed out some scurrilous<br />\nanti-Chavez literature. The man said, pointing to the<br />\npickets, \"These guys haven't tried to get the facts.<br />\nThey're just sympathetic to the cause.\"<br />\nFarm Bureau Sick<br />\nAccording to these sick men of the Farm Bureau, the<br />\nmigrant worker's life expectancy of 48 years, his hungry<br />\nchildren, and his pitiful income of $800 to $1900 a year<br />\nare mere figments of Chavez's imagination.<br />\nOne lady with mixed brown and greyish hair showed<br />\nme what Chavez is up against. As she walked out of the<br />\nsupermarket in her cheap sunglasses, with her young<br />\nblonde daughter beside her she gave an angry look at the<br />\npicketers. As she pushed her shopping cart towards her<br />\ncar, she answered my questions about the picketing and<br />\nthe grape boycott in a tight, mean voice.<br />\n\"It is just as bad as you kids demonstrating in front<br />\nof colleges, and you don't have any reason.\"<br />\nDo you plan to purchase grapes in the future?<br />\n\"I sure do!

The<br />\nemployer owns thousands of acres, and<br />\nthey literally own everything that lives<br />\nthere, grows there, and works there.<br />\nThey own the courts and they own the<br />\npolice.\"<br />\nBe cause of their power, he<br />\ncontended, the union faced difficulties<br />\nother unions these days don't have to<br />\ndeal with. \"You see, in agriculture we<br />\ndon't have any of the rules and<br />\nregulations that other unions have to go<br />\nby. We aren't covered under the<br />\nNational Labor Relations Act, we're<br />\nexcluded as workers. It's not enough for<br />\na 100% of the workers to leave the<br />\nfields to get recognized.

During his talk, Chavez<br />\nvehemently attacked the Farm Bureau.<br />\n\"In America for many years,\" he,<br />\ncharged, \"the Farm Bureau has done a<br />\ngood job of opposing any legislation<br />\nthat's going to benefit the workers.<br />\nThey \u2022 also implanted in the minds of<br />\nthe American people that all the farmers<br /><br />\nare small land-holders.

The<br />\nPentagon, he observed, has increased<br />\ngrape shipments to Vietnam by 350%.<br />\nThe Defense Department's comment on<br />\nthe matter, he said, was, \"There has<br />\nbeen a routine craving for grapes by the<br />\nsoldiers in Vietname.\" Chavez declared,<br />\n\"If the Pentagon was not buying the<br />\ngrapes and feeding the soldiers in<br />\nVietnam an average of eight pounds per<br />\nman, we would've won the strike a long<br />\ntime ago.\"<br />\nOpposition Weapons<br />\nHe added, \"We're not asking for any<br />\nspecial favors, all we want to do is make<br />\nthe fight equal.

Despite much rhetoric about peace<br />\nand the few taken steps toward de-escalation<br />\nproduced by the Nixon Administration, the<br />\nimpression is growing that our government has<br />\nnot decisively changed the discredited war<br />\npolicies of the previous administration.<br />\nPerceptive journalists, like Tom Wicker,<br />\nincreasingly report that Nixon's immediate goal<br />\nis not to end the war but to defuse domestic<br />\nopposition in order to gain more time for<br />\nnegotiating a peace on terms acceptable to the<br />\nAdministration. We do not agree with the<br />\nmorality or the intelligence of this strategy.<br />\nWe believe that maximum pressure should be<br />\napplied here at home to persuade the President<br />\nthat the immediate withdrawal of American<br />\ntroops from Vietnam is in the best interests of<br />\nAmerica and Vietnam. We believe that as<br />\nprofessors, as citizens, and as men, we should be<br />\ndoing more to stop this unconscienable, futile<br />\nwar. Consequently, we ask your support for the<br />\nforthcoming October 15 Vietnam Moratorium on<br />\nteaching. We propose that the administration at<br />\nJohns Hopkins, like the administrations at<br />\nRutgers and the University of Michigan,<br />\nauthorize calling off classes on that day, so that<br />\nwe may devote October 15 to working for peace.<br />\nShould the university administration not call a<br />\nformal moratorium, we propose that the<br />\nfaculty\u2014either as a body, or, if that proves<br />\nimpossible, as individuals\u2014refrain from teaching<br />\non October 15 to allow their students and<br />\nthemselves to participate in the activities of the<br />\nday.

Today it is supported by<br />\nAmericans encompassing a wide range of political<br />\npersuasions, including prominent Republicans<br />\nand Democrats in the Congress, religious leaders<br />\nand nationally known professors.

Thereafter, if reasonable responses<br />\nare not forthcoming from the Administration a<br />\ntwo day Moratorium will be called for<br />\nNovember; and so on.

In any case,<br />\nbefore any guilt has been proved, police agencies are<br />\nrounding up the Panthers in the most bizarre of ways<br />\nimaginable.<br />\nChairman Bobby Seale was picked up most recently.<br />\nLeaving a wedding in Oakland, police grabbed Seale and<br />\nbrought him to the San Francisco City Jail. His charge<br />\nwas the same as the other 14 now arrested in the case:<br />\nmurder, kidnapping, conspiracy to commit muder and<br />\nconspiracy to kidnap. The FBI is hosting this treasure<br />\nhunt.<br />\nOthers were arrested in New Haven, Denver, Salt<br />\nLake City and Los Angeles. The testimony of an FBI<br />\n\"informer\" black-man George Sams; is the thin strand of<br />\nevidence used by the FBI for these mass arrests. Sams<br />\ntestified that it took the whole central committee of the<br />\nPanthers to OK the alleged execution of Rackley.<br /><br />\nLOS ANGELES\u2014(CPS) The Black Panther<br />\nParty is being slowly, carefully, but very<br />\nassuredly erdicated. The highly-organized<br />\nprocess that is eliminating all the top leaders is<br />\nin full swing. Whether it is conscious or not, it si<br />\nindicative that the status quo has the unnerving<br />\nability to strangle anything that threatens it.<br />\nThere are now, at least, 46 top party officials,<br />\nincluding chairman Bobby Seale, under arrest<br />\nfrom New Haven to Los Angeles, They are being<br />\nheld on bail that exceeds two million dollars.<br />\nEven if the charges on the Panthers are real (which is<br />\nhighly suspect)\u2014even were the bail somehow justified,<br />\neven if they are all truly guilty, wouldn't the number of<br />\narrests of prestigious officials alone draw the attention<br />\nof the press? So it seems. But while Dave and Chet and<br />\nWalter and Eric content themselves with discussions<br />\nabout other political groups such as the Mobe, the<br />\nPresidio 27 or the Milwaukee 14, the press has refused to<br />\ndeal with the Panthers. Thus, the story of their very real<br />\noppression goes unknown\u2014and the blatant attempts to<br />\nanihiliate them extra-legally flourish without criticism.<br />\nThe Black Panther Movement is apparently so<br />\nthreatening it must be fought with out greatest weapon:<br />\nignoring it. By totally ignoring this revolution we are<br />\npretending, if not promulgating, an environment in<br />\nwhich it just doesn't exist. And this makes a convenient<br />\ntime for government officials to dispense with the party<br />\nall together.<br /><br />\nWhat maeks the situation particularly suspect is the<br />\nmethod in which FBI agents are rounding up the top<br />\nofficials; Scale's case is typical. Normally, extradition<br />\nproceedings would be necessary for transporting Seale to<br />\nNew Haven, where he would face trial. But several days<br />\nafter holding him in jail without bond, FBI men \"swept\"<br />\nSeale away by car to Chicago, where, all of a sudden he<br />\nwas implicated with the other resisters now facing trial<br /><br />\nRevised Bus Schedule<br /><br />\nHopkins students, new and old, eat at:<br /><br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br /><br />\nThere is a revision in the<br />\nGoucher-Hopkins bus service,<br />\neffective Monday October 6,<br />\n1969.<br />\nThe bus stops at Van Meter<br />\nHall at Goucher and Levering<br />\nHall at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nfor the finest italian food in town<br /><br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nSPAGNETTI MEALS<br />\nPIZZA Po A SPECIALTY<br /><br />\nin Chicago for inciting to riot during the Chicago<br />\nconvention. This federal charge made it unnecessary for<br />\nagents to file extradition papers. After the Chicago trials,<br />\nwhere Seale will undoubtedly be cleared, it will be no<br />\nproblem for the FBI to transport him east instead of<br />\nwest. And New Haven will no doubt be an appropriate<br />\nmotel stop for the weary drivers. There Seale will be<br />\napprehended by local police.<br />\nThe \"national\" plan is alleged to come from J. Edgar<br />\nHoover. The OK to transport Seale by car, as reported<br />\nby CBS news, allegedly came from Supreme Court<br />\nJustice William 0. Douglas. This is all compouded by<br />\nBerkeley Police Chief Bruce Baker's fumbling of a plan<br />\nhe devised for \"annihiliating the party's national office,\"<br />\nthe news of which fell into hands of reporters.(By the<br />\nway, the attention given Baker's plan was minimal,<br />\nbecause reporters felt it was too clumsily conceived.

Originally, the GSO<br />\nconstitution had allowed for the<br />\nappointment of various members of the<br />\nGSO to the standing committees of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe Graduate Council of the GSO<br />\nmet on Sept. 16, and nominated<br />\nmembers of the GSO for appointment<br />\nto the various University standing<br />\ncommittees. On Sept. 18, the Graduate<br />\nBoard approved the nominations.<br />\nAt last night's meeting, the GSO<br />\nC<br /><br />\nvoted in favor of the creation of a<br />\nUniversity Senate. It plans, however, to<br />\ndraw up its own blueprints for the<br />\nbody.<br />\nNominations were also made to the<br />\ncommittee on Student Relations and<br />\nthe newly-formed Medical Planning and<br />\nDevelopment committee. At the present<br />\ntime, there are two members of the<br />\nGSO on each of nine standing<br />\nUniversity committees.<br />\nThe Graduate Student Organization<br />\nwas formed last spring and the officers<br />\nand representatives were elected last<br />\nMay. At that time, Cotter stated that he<br />\nwould, \"work toward having some one<br />\non the Academic Cpuncil next year<br />\n('69-`70).\" Cotter also stated that he<br />\nhoped for Greater cooperation between<br />\ngraduates and undergraduate students,<br />\nand representation of graduate students<br />\non all standing committees of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nLate last week, Cotter stated that<br />\n\"undergraduates take such a secondary<br />\nrole. I'd like to see that role defined. I'd<br />\nlike to support John (Meaning John<br />\nGuess, president of the Student<br />\nCouncil).<br />\nCotter stated that he hoped to see<br /><br />\nthe GSO force the University to take a<br />\ndefined position on issues such as black<br />\nstudent enrollment, and the University's<br />\nrelation to the community.<br />\nCotter also said that he was in favor<br />\nof the GSO calling for the abolition of<br />\nROTC. He would not comment on the<br />\npossibility that this would happen.<br />\nCotter noted that \"the issue isn't dead.<br />\nThere is a better chance that something<br />\nwill be done now than there was last<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nNot Much Fun<br />\nAmong other duties, the GSO is in<br />\ncharge of proposing a budget for the<br />\nGraduate Club, a social club for<br />\ngraduate students. Cotter said that he<br />\nwould be pushing for a larger budget for<br />\nthe Club as \"there is little for the<br />\ngraduate student in the way of fun.\"<br />\nMuch of the work being done by the<br />\nGSO is a continuation of work done by<br />\nlast year's Graduate Club. However, Mr.<br />\nCotter stated that this was in no way a<br />\nusurpation of the Graduate Club's<br />\npower.<br />\nDean Strider stated that the GSO<br />\nshould be a \"very positive thing\" and an<br />\n\"articulate, responsible part of the<br />\nprocess.\"<br /><br />\n10i/K 13,4/ U.<br />\nWORLD SERIES<br />\nG I LETTE ADJUSTABLE<br />\nRAZOR<br />\n$1.95<br /><br />\n:41/4<br /><br />\n****<br />\nUNIVERSITY ONE<br />\nCOFFEE SHOP<br />\nFEATURING:<br /><br />\nDoug Taylor<br />\ngot his B.S. degree<br />\nin Electronics Engineering<br />\nIn 1967.<br />\nDoug is already a senior associate<br />\nengineer in Advanced Technology at<br />\nIBM.His job: designing large-scale<br />\nintegrated circuits that will go into<br />\ncomputers five to ten years from now.<br />\nThe challenge of LSI<br />\n\"Most of today's computers,\"Doug<br />\npoints out,\"use hybrid integrated<br />\ncircuits.

This unsung hero is<br />\nRandolph Boone Miller.<br />\nRandy, who wears number 3 on his white jersey, is the Blue Jay<br />\nkicking specialist. Against Muhlenberg he went four for four (one<br />\nfield goal from twenty-two yards out and three extra points). His<br />\nfield go:II from a somewhat difficult angle off to the left of the<br />\ngoalposts proved to be the winning margin. Randy, noted for the<br />\nobscurity of his puns, might have called it a \"Boone Boom\".<br />\nInjured Player Soccer<br />\nThe week before the Muhlenberg game \"Boone\" fell victim to the<br />\ninjury jinx that seems to plague this year's gridders. His shoulder,<br />\nseparation, however, came on the soccer field. Yet, except for one<br />\nday when he practiced his-kicking technique with his right arm in a<br />\nsling, this injury did not seem to detract from his ability.<br />\nAlthough he might be forced to miss several games due to his<br />\nresponsibilities as one of Coach Knauff's star halfbacks, expect to<br />\nsee number 3 kicking a lot more extra points and field goals for the<br />\nBlue Jays this fall. Both of Bachur's records are definitely within<br />\nBoone's range. And who knows? Maybe even Ed Winsten will be able<br />\nto find space in his article for Randy outside the small print of the<br />\nscoring column.<br />\nRifle Team<br />\nThe least publicized Varsity sport at Johns Hopkins is<br />\nundoubtedly the highly successful Rifle Team, which is open to any<br />\nexperienced undergraduate marksman on the Homewood campus.<br />\nLast year':- Blue Jay shooters finished with an 8-3 won-lost record<br />\nwhich was good enough to place them thirtieth of 264 teams in<br />\nnational standings.<br />\nIn collegiate rifle competition, a shooter fires at a 10x12 inch<br />\ntarget sheet from a distance of 50 feet with a .22 caliber rifle. There<br />\nare ten individual targets on this sheet. These targets are about Hi<br />\ninches in diameter, and are graded inward from one point on the<br />\nouter circle to ten points at the bullseye.<br />\nAn individual shooter gets ten shots at each target sheet (one for<br />\neach individual target) from three positions, (prone, kneeling, and<br />\nstanding), for a total of three target sheets and thirty shots in all.<br />\nThe firer is aliowed unlimited practice shots as long as he co.npletes<br />\nrecorded fire in 36 minutes. The highest score obtainable is 300.<br />\nThe 1969-70 JHU Rifleman are captained by Senior Paul E.<br />\nSchoen. Contact Paul Schoen at box 335 for further information or<br />\nif you are interested in shooting for the Johns Hopkins Team.

Paul Weiss<br />\nplunged from the two yard line for the score<br />\nonly four minutes into the game.<br />\nThe Blue Jays monopolized control of the ball<br />\nfor the first half. Bob Pfeifer had eight<br />\ncompleted passes in ten attempts for 120 yards,<br />\nwith plenty of time from his offensive line to<br />\nconnect with Steve Latson, Bill Donovan, and<br />\nflanker Dave Pickall. Especially effective was<br />\nsix-foot-four, 220-pound Latson who broke<br />\nthrough the tackles of the small Muhlenberg<br />\ndefenders after his five receptions. One of those<br />\nreceptions went for a touchdown. Paul Weiss,<br /><br />\nHenry Robey, and Steve Hata mobilized the<br />\nrunning for the Jays picking up 126 yards in the<br />\nentire game.<br />\nDefense Decisive<br />\nThe Hopkins defense, however, proved to be<br />\nthe decisive factor in the game. Hopkins back<br />\nDave Nolan picked off two of Randy Ulrich's<br />\npasses to Muhlenberg receivers. The defensive<br />\nsquad recovered three Mule fumbles. The Blue<br />\nJay line's constant pressure on Mule quarterback<br />\nRandy Ulrich took its toll: Ulrich completed<br />\nonly 46 percent of his passes and was dumped<br />\nbehind the line of scrimmage five times for<br />\nsizable losses.<br />\nThe Mules' lone score in the first hafl came<br />\nafter Pfiefer fumbled on Hopkins' ten yard line.<br />\nTwo minutes before, the Jay defense stopped the<br />\nMules two yards away from a touchdown. Randy<br />\nUlrich finally went to the air from six yards out<br />\nto get a touchdown.<br />\nIn the second half, Bob Pfiefer and his speedy<br />\nflanker Dave Pickall demonstrated the<br />\ndevastating passing attack of the Blue Jays..<br />\nPickall caught two touchdown passes and gained<br />\n120 yards in the second half.

The first,<br />\nwhich was strongly worded,<br />\nstated that all Freshmen should<br />\nsign who believed P.E. to be<br />\n\"boring, meaningless, stupid,<br />\nand completely irrelevant\" to<br />\ntheir college education. This<br />\npetition did not receive the<br />\nresponse, which Weiss, and<br />\nSeigel, the two initiators of the<br />\nmovement, had expected.<br />\nInstead, they wrote a new<br />\npetit ion, toiling down its<br />\n'wording to say that P.E. should<br />\nbe made voluntary for freshmen.<br />\nliven though 372 Frosh<br />\nsigned, the four agreed that if a<br />\nfreshmen student would not sign<br />\nr iim, in almost all<br /><br />\ncases, he would not sign the<br />\nsecond.

Another<br />\nfrosh opinion which concurred<br />\nwith Michaelson's was made by<br />\nLen Pugatch who believed that if<br />\na student feels it necessary to<br />\npartake in athletics, he will do so<br />\nwhether it be mandatory or not.<br />\nTherefore, P.E. should be made<br />\nstrictly voluntary. \u201e \u2022<br />\n\"MAP<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCT 3, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 19<br /><br />\nSPORTS<br />\nStrong First Game Victory Football Centenary Marked<br />\nRaises Championship Hopes By Eulogy To Ted Straus<br />\n(Continued from page 18)<br /><br />\nhis man and raced 58 yards to the goal.<br />\nThat gave the Blue Jays a 20-8 lead.

The<br />\n\"base<br />\nis the danger point for<br />\npestiscide poisoning .<br />\nSpeaking in a soft, low-keyed voice,<br />\nChavez said, \"We're not asking for too<br />\nmuch. The employers can work with all<br />\nthese restrictions we want. They can<br />\nharvest, they can cultivate, they can<br />\nproduce perfectly healthy grapes<br />\nwithout the use of DDT. They can<br />\ncertainly afford more money to protect<br />\ntheir workers, the same people who're<br />\ngoing to be doing the harvesting and the<br />\nwork in the vines.\"<br />\nBitter Struggle<br />\nChavez also pointed out the dangers<br />\nof pestiscides to the consumer in the<br />\nquestion-and-answer period. \"The Food<br />\nand Drug Administration said that a<br />\nlimit of one part/million of Aldrin was<br />\nthe maximum fit for consumption.<br />\nGrapes from a Safeway store in<br />\nWashington were found by a local tab to<br />\nhave 180 times the limit.

Their classifications<br />\nare now invalid, and most draft boards will most likely<br />\nignore them rather than submit them to the legal<br />\nprocedures necessary to change the person's<br />\nclassification or validate the 1-A status.<br />\nJudge Peckham clearly ruled that only Congress can<br />\nrefuse the right of counsel for any person being<br />\ninterrogated by federal institutions and that no legal<br />\ndelegation of this power has ever been granted to the<br />\nPresident (and through him local draft boards). The<br />\nchallenge affects all draft boards under government<br />\njurisdiction unless it is overruled in a higher court.<br /><br />\nOperation Intercept, the Nixon Administrattin's<br />\nweek-and-a-half-old attempt to blockade drug t'affic<br />\nacross the 1700-mile Mexican border, has causqd an<br />\nuproar throughout that country.<br />\nThe operation has set off close inspections of<br />\nautomobile and pedestrian traffic by United States<br />\ncustoms guards at all border points, as well as radar<br />\ncontrol and pursuit of small planes.<br />\nDelays as long as six hours have kept outraged<br />\nmotorists waiting in line in the broiling sun at the<br />\ninternational highways leading from Mexico to ale<br />\nUnited States from Laredo, Texas, to Tijuana on ON<br />\nCalifornia Line.

Drinking and<br />\nliberalized curfews had been among the most persistent<br />\nstudent demands for years.<br />\nOnly two years ago all women were required to be in<br />\ntheir dorms or sorority houses at times ranging from<br />\n10:30 p.m. for freshmen to midnight for seniors.

He warned that students who<br />\nresorted to violence and deny the basic rights of others<br />\nwould be suspended from the college and subject to<br />\naction by the civil authorities.<br />\nAt the same time, Dr. Barringer told the students that<br />\nthe administration would continue to provide them with<br />\nan open forum and means by which they could<br />\nparticipate in the decision-making process of the college.<br />\nThe statement, which was mailed to the students last<br />\nweekend, was not prompted by any specific incident, a<br />\ncollege official stated. \"I know of no action on the part<br />\nof any individual or group which prompted the<br />\nstatement,\" said Graham Vinzant, dean of student<br />\npersonnel. \"We just wanted to make it crystal clear<br />\nwhere we stood.\"<br /><br />\nNismem.<br /><br />\nA sociologist from Tulane University who conducted<br />\na national poll of 2,000 college seniors last year has<br />\nreported that the results showed the emergence of a new<br />\nideology, which he calls \"privatism,\" among the student<br />\ngeneration.<br />\nIn an article entitled \"The Private Generation\"<br />\nappearing in the October issue of Psychology Today, Dr.<br />\nJeffrey K. Hadden said this ideology is \" the most<br />\ndistinctive and obvious trait\" to emerge from the replies<br />\nto the survey's 246 questions. He added that this new<br />\nemphasis on the personal is both altruistic and selfish,<br />\nbecause it \"acknowledges the privileges of- private<br />\nexistence --as rights --to all men\" but tends to become<br />\nself-indulgent at its \"logical extreme.\"<br />\nDr. Hadden defined personalism as the \"whole<br />\nideology\" that includes \" student withdraw! from<br />\ninstitutions into the self\" and the rejection of<br />\nmeaning or authority outside of the self.\"<br />\nDr. Hadden, concluded that the new ethic is \"both<br />\nominous and promising.\" If privatism leads \"toward<br />\nbecoming a sensitive and honest person,\" he says, \"our<br />\nsociety's unfettered faith in youth may turn out to be<br />\njustified.\" But he cautions that \"privatism's present<br />\nmood and form seems ... almost void of notions for<br />\nexercise of responsibility toward others.\"<br /><br />\nCesar Chavez, the leader of the California grape<br />\nboycott, accused growers on Monday of \"systematic<br />\npoisoning\" of field workers with pesticides.<br />\nAppearing before the Senate Subcommittee on<br />\nMigratory Labor the 42-year-old director of the United<br />\nFarm Workers Organizing Committee said that owners of<br />\nthe vineyards were using poisonous pesticides in<br />\nincreasing quantities. He said that thousands of workers<br />\nwere becoming ill after breathing and touching the<br />\npesticides.<br />\n\"They see this as an extension of the collective<br />\nbargaining process, which they are not prepared to<br />\naccept,\" Cheves declared. His charge was refuted by<br />\nSenator George Murphy of California who claimed that<br />\n\"the union has raised the pesticide issue in an effort to<br />\nharass the grape industry.\" Specifically, he stated that<br />\nevidence presented by the union last month was<br />\nmisleading.<br />\nThe evidence consisted of a laboratory report of a<br />\nsample of grapes taken from a Washington Chain grocery<br />\nstore. The report showed poisonous residues of aldrin<br />\nthat were 180 times the level of accepted human<br />\ntolerance. Under questioning from the Committee<br />\nmembers, the Federal Food and Drug spoksman said he<br />\ncould not categorically state that the tests were<br />\ninaccurate, although he admitted those taken in<br />\nWashington may have been false.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40350, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "9952691d-1646-41e2-86c1-4aea5126a89a", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13989-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13989, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "e72b34c0-cad6-4cb1-bab7-cf8011f44d77", "url": "/node/13989"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "53796545-55c4-4333-aee5-5a6b1d8dbf56"}]}
