Well, this article has been<br />\nprompted by the fact that three Hopkins<br />\nstudents, Susan Gilbert, Bruce McClay,<br />\nand Terry Vickers, have called for the<br />\nformation of the JHU Gay Caucus, and are<br />\nlooking forward to meeting with the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins gay community and other<br />\ninterested students in Conference Room B<br />\nof the Student Union Wednesday night at<br />\n7:30 p.m.<br />\nThe JHU Gay Caucus wishes to provide<br />\na supportive and educational atmosphere<br />\nfor gays and straights alike. Its purpose<br />\nwould be to raise the political, social and<br />\npersonal consciousness of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. The JHU Gay Caucus is<br />\napplying for SAC funds,so a good turnout<br />\nat the meeting Wednesday night is crucial.<br />\n(The Kinsey figures state that about ten<br />\nper cent of you people are in some way<br />\ngay. This includes bisexuality.) The<br />\nWomen's Center has already given its<br />\nendorsement of the JHU Gay Caucus,<br />\ncalling it another example of \"personal<br />\nliberation.\" If successful, the JHU Gay<br />\nCaucus would join the already existing<br />\nlarge handful of Baltimore gay<br />\norganizations, including the Baltimore Gay<br />\nAlliance; Dignity, a gay Catholic<br />\norganization; the Baltimore Women's<br />\nLiberation Movement; and, the Lesbian<br />\nCommunity Center.<br />\nTerry Vickers has been active in the<br />\nBaltimore Gay Alliance, and is presently<br />\none of the coordinators for the course<br />\n\"Individual and Societal Growth,\"<br />\nsponsored by the Office of the Chaplain.<br />\nSusan Gilbert is in that course, and<br />\nselected the Metropolitan Community<br />\nChurch, a church ministering especially to<br />\nthe needs of the Christian gay community,<br />\nfor field study. Susan explains that most<br />\nof her friends since her junior year in high<br />\nschool had been gay people, and she had a<br />\n<br />\ngreat deal of experience with gay<br />\ncounseling. At one time she even<br />\nconsidered going into the gay ministry. As<br />\na possible project with MCC, Susan hopes to be bringing together the males and<br />\nfemales in the gay community. (This<br />\nbegins to raise some interesting questions<br />\nabout what it really means to be gay.)<br />\nBruce McClay explains the need for a<br />\nJHU Gay Caucus by demonstrating the<br />\ndilemma of the gay Hopkins student. He is<br />\ntrying to structure a homosexual lifestyle<br />\nin a heterosexual environment. Obviously,<br />\nhe is rarely successful. He must turn to<br />\nother outlets for his homosexual social<br />\nlife. Here in Baltimore he has the options<br />\nof going to the gay bars, where he stands a<br />\ngood chance of being abused by total<br />\nstrangers, just as he does at various<br />\nsteambaths, or Wyman Park, which is a<br />\nreputed gay \"pick up\" spot, and has also<br />\nrecently been the scene of police<br />\nharrassment toward gays. The JHU Gay<br />\nCaucus would provide a needed outlet,<br />\nand hopefully. be the support structure<br />\nwhich will enable. the Hopkins gay<br />\ncommunity to come out of its closet.<br />\nBut in a broader sense, all of us have<br />\nour closets.

Upon reading the dispatch on the<br />\nKissinger trip to China (Sunday New York<br />\nTimes) one gets the impression that the<br />\nSecretary of State is capable of bouncing a<br />\nball off his nose, changing a flat tire, and<br />\nPlaying Wizen Irish Eyes are Smiling on the<br />\nkazoo\u2014simultaneou<br />\nsly.<br />\n.Apparently, Henry planned this latest<br />\nsojourn in order to inform Chinese leaders<br />\nthat America is committed to maintaining<br />\nand improving relations with Russia. Yet<br />\nthe United States will also be \"...alert to<br />\nthe continuing ambition and military<br />\nstrength of the Soviet Union.\"<br />\nThe last statement from the article<br />\nImplies the following: the United States is<br />\nWell aware of Chinese anxie tes over the<br />\nflew Moscow -Washington relationship.<br />\nHowever, the Administration will not<br />\nsacrifice the gains from detente simply<br />\nbecause Peking barks. On the other hand,<br />\nif the Asian giant's fears are not allayed,<br />\nthe Chinese could take political or military<br />\na ction\u2014consequently disturbing the<br />\nPresent international equilibrium.<br />\nWhat exactly does the People's<br />\n<br />\nRepublic of China fear? The conjecture<br />\nhere is that Chou En-Lai et al believe that<br />\nif America draws too close to Russia,<br />\nMoscow may attempt to improve its<br />\nstrategic position in South Asia with the<br />\nconviction that such action will not<br />\nengender a U.S. response. Thus, Peking's<br />\nvital interests in the region will be<br />\nendangered. In conclusion China expects<br />\nand Kissinger's statements signal that<br />\nAmerica will be the\" balancer\" of power<br />\nin the current global confrontation.<br />\nIf Americans are confused as to whose<br />\n\"side\" we are on, they need not be<br />\nembarrassed. As supervisor of the peace,<br />\nUncle Sam will at times favor Peking, back<br />\nRussia, or remain uncommitted,<br />\ndepending on the international problem<br />\nand the American interests at stake.<br />\nFor example, at present it seems<br />\nopportune to solidify our position viz-a-viz<br />\nChina inasmuch as: (1) the momentum of<br />\ndetente, despite the much ballyhooed<br />\nwheat deal, has decreased and (2) the<br />\nelderly Chinese leaders who began the<br />\nreconciliation with the United States are<br />\ngradually limiting their diplomatic<br />\n<br />\n'DOCTOR...IT'S TIME.'<br />\n<br />\nthose personal tastes which they feel a<br />\nneed to hide. Perhaps you are the woman<br />\nwho goes out of her way to keep her<br />\nrather full sexual life an unknown secret.<br />\nOr, you are the stud who has never had<br />\nany sex of any kind, save for<br />\nmasturbation, his his whole life. No mattei<br />\nwhat the situation, though, to protect our<br />\nown private closets, we all project some<br />\nkind of public sexual image.<br />\nMost of you will at least admit to<br />\nyourselves\u2014in some cases, painful as it<br />\nmay be\u2014that your preferences are really<br />\nbisexual. But publicly you have to project<br />\nsome kind of definite image, which will<br />\nget the message across. Sometimes, gay or<br />\nstraight, one becomes so wrapped up in<br />\nthis public image, that it becomes an<br />\nobsession. The image becomes an extreme.<br />\nYou can't stop hiding from yourself<br />\nuntil you come out of your closet. This is<br />\nwhat the JHU Gay Caucus is all about.<br />\nNot only do you personally have to accept<br />\nyour growth, but society as well must<br />\naccept it, reaffirm your right to do so, and<br />\ngrow with you. As long as you remain in<br />\nyour closet, you are being very unfair to<br />\nyourself. If you can live with that, then<br />\nyou need never worry about your values.<br />\n<br />\nactivities. Thus Kissinger would like to<br />\ncement our ties with Peking before new<br />\nleaders emerge.<br />\nThis is where the juggling act fits in.<br />\nKissinger must assure Russia that a new<br />\nChinese-American relationship will not<br />\npose a threat to Soviet security or harm<br />\nthe concept of detente. The difference<br />\nbetween diplomacy in a multi-polar world<br />\nand diplomacy in a bi-polar one is<br />\ncomparable to that between chess and<br />\ncheckers: the object of both games is to<br />\nwin, but the strategy is more complex in<br />\nthe former.<br />\nWell, as of now the song is one key, the<br />\nflat tire is off, and the ball is bouncing<br />\nsteadily. Still, Kissinger seems to assume<br />\nthat the rift between Russia and China is<br />\ndeep, so much so that reconciliation in the<br />\nnear future is improbable. Yet, both<br />\ncountries have serious differences with<br />\nWashington over such matters as Taiwan,<br />\nnuclear disarmament, and the Middle East.<br />\nThe Communist titans may tomorrow join<br />\nhands and exclaim a la Bismarck: \"The<br />\nenemy of my enemy is my friend.\"<br />\nHowever, let us assume that the<br />\ncleavage between the two nations is wide.<br />\nOne other phenomena may ironically draw<br />\ntogether the separated (not divorced)<br />\npartners: America's balance of power<br />\nstrategy as practiced by the Secretary of<br />\nState. China and Russia could perceive<br />\nthat their estrangement is only helping one<br />\ncountry\u2014the United States. Moreover,<br />\nboth may react to a situation where the<br />\n\"balancer\" pits one nation against the<br />\nother, improves relations with both, and<br />\nincreases her global influence at their<br />\nexpanse. That is, as the American strategic<br />\nposition improves, the Communist stances<br />\nweaken.<br />\nAnd, with the Secretary of Defense<br />\nclamoring for a restoration of monetary<br />\ncuts in a svelte $90 billion military budget,<br />\nit should surprise no one, least of all<br />\nKissinger, if the Big Bear and the Yellow<br />\nStar begin a rapprochement of their own.<br />\n<br />\nread any further. If, on the other hand,<br />\nyou like your corned beef piled high<br />\nbetween two slices of rye drenched with<br />\nmustard, then Jack's of Lombard Street<br />\nmay be your kind of place:<br />\nOnly Three<br />\nThe 1000 and 1100 blocks of East<br />\nLombard Street used to be lined with<br />\ndelicatessens. Now there are only three<br />\nleft. Jack's is the largest operation. Drive<br />\ndown to East Baltimore in the middle of<br />\nthe day (you'll wait forever if you try to<br />\ngo by bus); search for a parking space in<br />\nJack's crowded lot or along traffic-choked<br />\nLombard St.; avoid stepping on a wino<br />\nwhen you walk in the door; resist the<br />\ntemptation to buy a state lottery ticket<br />\nfrom the machine which catches your eye.<br />\nFine. You've made it to Jack's fast food<br />\nline. Now you are ready to choose from a<br />\ntempting selection of sandwiches: corned<br />\nbeef, roast beef, rare beef, turkey, salami,<br />\nand (you should pardon the expression)<br />\nham.They all cost about a dollar; if you're<br />\na stickler for lean corned beef, it'll cost a<br />\nquarter extra. But Jack's regular 99-cent<br />\nedition is lean enough for my taste.<br />\nPastrami<br />\nIf you desire a hot pastrami, the. other<br />\nmember of the Jack's pantheon, it will<br />\ntake a little longer. You'll be directed a<br />\nlittle further down the counter where the<br />\nhot dogs and kishka hold sway. There, on<br />\na grill last cleaned during FDR's third term<br />\n(just kidding, Jack; call off the lawyers),<br />\nyou may watch one of the genial<br />\nemployees heat up the pastrami. Now, you<br />\ncan buy a quarter pound of pastrami for<br />\n59 cents\u2014which is roughly the amoung<br />\nJack's gives you on his 99-cent<br />\nsandwich\u2014but it won't be the same<br />\nquality. You know he's making a slight<br />\nprofit, but one taste of a Jack's hot<br />\npastrami on rye will convince you it's<br />\nworth it. The two critics accompanying<br />\nme on this visit compared the place<br />\nfavorably with the 'famous Premier Deily<br />\nin The Hub and with Brooklyn's renowned<br />\nSchmulka Bernstein's, which is saying<br />\nsomething. All I know is that there ain't<br />\nno way you're gonna get a sandwich as<br />\ngood as one of Jack's creations around<br />\nHomewood.

He<br />\nused to kid me about being an American<br />\nin tutorial, and one day he told a joke in<br />\nclass that, in a way, was pretty true about<br />\nmost visiting Americans.

An old adage<br />\nis \"If ye can see th' hills, its gang tae rain,<br />\nif ye cannae see th' hills, it's raining.\" It<br />\nturned out to be true. The only weekend I<br />\nhad dry feet was the time it rained solid<br />\nfor three days and I never budged from<br />\nmy tent. But when it isn't raining,<br />\nScotland is exquisitely beautiful.<br />\nThe colors change constantly with the<br />\nchanging sky and seasons. I remember the<br />\nnight I went to sleep looking toward a few<br />\nhills I had to cross the next day and<br />\nthinking what a pleasant walk it would be.<br />\nI could see that the bracken was brown,<br />\ndead, and broken and would be easy to<br />\nwalk through. I could also see the darker<br />\nbrown of the heather, which meant fairly<br />\ndry ground. The following morning I<br />\nawoke to discover that it had snowed<br />\nduring the night and my pleasant walk<br />\nturned into a snow plod. As I stood on top<br />\nof Ben Alder later that day, I could see<br />\ndown into the corries through the glen and<br />\nacross the Rannoch moor all the way to<br />\nGlencoe. I'll always remember it.<br />\nScottish beer is the best in the world,<br />\nbut before you'll believe me, I'll have to<br />\nqualify that a little. Some Scottish beer<br />\ntastes worse than most American beer,<br />\nwhich in my opinion is pretty bad. But<br />\nreal Scottish ale is something that you can<br />\ndrink and enjoy. The Real Ale movement<br />\nis fairly large, and it's worth the extra<br />\nmoney to drink a pint of Belhaven's heavy<br />\ndrawn from the wood. It's dark, not fizzy,<br />\nand has a nutty flavor that is very<br />\nwelcome after drinking comparatively<br />\ntasteless Schlitz. Belhaven's is a small<br />\nbrewery\u2014they don't deliver anywhere<br />\noutside of Edinburgh; there are six<br />\nbreweries in the city.

The castle sits on top of a volcanic<br />\nplug and is approachable from one side<br />\nonly.

I<br />\nwas at a Burns supper, and had been<br />\ncajoled into reading some of his poetry,<br />\nmy tongue being lubricated by half a<br />\nbottle of whiskey. By this time I'd learned<br />\nhow to drink half a bottle of whiskey and<br />\nnot be drunk. Well, not too drunk. I asked<br />\nif I could have a go at the bagpipes, and<br />\nwas told I could. I was handed the<br />\ndeflated pipes and shown how to fill them<br />\nand how to get the drones to produce a<br />\ncontinuous sound. Once that was<br />\nmastered, there was still the chanter to<br />\nplay the tune on, and that's where<br />\neverything fell apart. I used to play the<br />\n<br />\nclarinet, and tried to play the pipes the<br />\nsame way. Well, with the pipes, it's a blow<br />\nand squeeze, blow and squeeze kind of<br />\noperation, and all I did was blow. Well,<br />\nsince I'd already filled the bag to capacity,<br />\nI was just blowing against myself, and I<br />\ngot red in the face. My. friends were<br />\nlaughing more and more, and I kept<br />\nblowing, and they kept laughing, and<br />\nfinally I had to give up.

DeVillier danced 3780 hours.<br />\nsetting a new world's record for the<br />\nlongest dance marathon. For their greedy<br />\nefforts, the couple, whose only motive was<br />\nmoney, won $10,000 and instantly<br />\nbecame American folk heroes. Vonnie.and<br />\nCallum parlayed their popularity into a<br />\nsizable fortuneland retired to a quiet farm<br />\nin the San Fernando Valley, but remained<br />\nan inspiration to thousands of<br />\nmoney-hungry couples who desperately<br />\ndegraded themselves to win dance<br />\nmarathons just for a few bucks. This<br />\nmadness led the reactionary evangilist<br />\nAimee Semple McPherson to say, \"I<br />\nbelieve that sterilization is the only means<br />\nof protecting our people from this<br />\nidiocy.\" Luckily the government was<br />\nnever forced to such radical measures<br />\nbecause dance marathons slowly died<br />\nduring World War II due to a serious<br />\nshortage of male partners and the fact that<br />\neverybody had money again.<br />\nIn great contrast to these ridiculous,<br />\nhumiliating spectacles, Dance Around the<br />\nClock, sponsored by the Maryland<br />\nAssociation for Retarded Citizens, is a<br />\ndance marathon based on generosity, not<br />\ngreed. Even though there is a Grand Prize<br />\nof $1000 (second place is worth $500 and<br />\nthird, $250), the matter of prizes seems<br />\nirrelevant in light of the overall purpose of<br />\nthe marathon. Never before have Hopkins<br />\nstudents been given so easy a chance to<br />\nshow their generosity and, at the same<br />\ntime, enjoy themselves.<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\nMaryland private colleges<br />\nTo receive aid boost in '77<br />\nBy BOB BUCHANAN<br />\nState aid to Maryland Private Colleges<br />\nwill increase 13 per cent in fiscal year<br />\n1977, supplying a much-needed boost in<br />\nrevenues for Hopkins and other private<br />\nschools, Budget Director Norman Krueger<br />\ndisclosed yesterday.<br />\nHopkins will be receiving the funds next<br />\nyear because of an increase in the<br />\nallocations to State schools.

Baker cited the poor<br />\ncoverage Eugene McCarthy received prior<br />\nto his strong showing in the New<br />\n<br />\nHampshire primary in 1968 as an example<br />\nof the bias against people whose ideas are<br />\nconsidered out of the mainstream of<br />\nthought.<br />\nAlways the hard-headed realist, Baker<br />\nexpressed his pessimism regarding the fate<br />\nof anyone who tried to be more open to<br />\nthese \"alternatives\" (such as socialism):<br />\n\"If you try, you won't last long as a<br />\nsyndicated columnist.\"<br />\nRecounting<br />\nRecounting his own career, Baker stated<br />\nthat he was responsible for the<br />\nNews-Letter's tabloid format, \"which<br />\nhasn't changed at all since 1947.\" After 15<br />\nyears as a reporter, he had expressed to<br />\nthe editor at the Times his discontent,<br />\nwhereupon he was asked to write a<br />\ncolumn to succeed \"Topics of the Times,\"<br />\nwhich \"copyboys were writing for $15 a<br />\nthrow\" and which \"nobody had read for<br />\nthirty years.\" Arthur Krock, C. L.<br />\nSulzberger, and James Reston wrote the<br />\nTimes columns on national and<br />\ninternational affairs.

All this,<br />\nand Hubert Laws is playing on My Cherie<br />\nAmour. Shit, Q, you're so bad you're<br />\ninvisible!<br />\nTony Williams Believe It(Columbia)<br />\nThere is little doubt; this is the most<br />\nimportant album in Jazz-rock since<br />\nMahavishnu's classic hmer Mounting<br />\nFlame. If you've never heard pure energy,<br />\nhere's your chance.<br />\nTony Williams was, at age 13, working<br />\nBoston clubs with Sam Rivers. At 17, he<br />\nwas Miles' drummer. And in 1968, he<br />\nformed his own band, .Tony William's<br />\nLifetime.<br />\n<br />\nThe first band consisted of Tony on<br />\ndrums, Larry Young on organ, John<br />\nMcLaughlin on guitar, and (occasionally)<br />\nJack Bruce on bass. It was Tony's band<br />\nthat brought McLaughlin to the U.S., and<br />\nit was Tony was introduced him to Miles.<br />\nMiles put him with Billy Cobham (A<br />\nTribute to Jack Johnson), and the rest is<br />\nhistory.<br />\nWhat is generally unknown, though, is<br />\nthat Tony was playing in 1968 what<br />\nCobham is playing today. Despite the<br />\npuffs, Tony Williams is this generation's<br />\nBuddy Rich. And if the Stanley Clarke<br />\nalbum didn't prove that, this will.<br />\nThe New Tony William's Lifetime<br />\nconsists of almost totally unknown<br />\nmusicians. Allan Holdworth, their<br />\nguitarist, is more than another guitarist,<br />\nmore than another McLaughlin. Where<br />\nMcLaughlin is fast, he is fast in an<br />\nantiseptic Segovian way. Holdsworth is<br />\nfast, fast as Coltrane, but with Trane's<br />\ntenor sax roughness, an electric gut-bucket<br />\nguitar.<br />\nThe group's Material ranges from<br />\nsupercharged superfunk, to pure energy<br />\nrock. Although they at first seem to lack<br />\nthe textural clarity of the McLaughlin<br />\n[coup, it soon becomes apparant that<br />\nTony's band has the beauty of jagged<br />\ncrystal, not Mahavishnu's lucite<br />\nsmoothness. And the difference is what<br />\nseparates Great Black Music from merely<br />\nGreat Music.<br />\nThe album will probably be a sleeper.<br />\nBut then, so was Inner Mounting Flame.<br />\nStanley Clarke Journey to Love<br />\n(Nemporer)<br />\nStanley's first album, Children of<br />\nForever, was a dog that was cut out of the<br />\ncatologue in four months. His second<br />\nalbum, Stanley Clarke, was a smash hit.<br />\nThis album will also be a smash hit, even<br />\nthough it doesn't deserve it.<br />\n<br />\nINFO & PHONE CHARGES: CALL (301) 363-0800<br />\n<br />\nTIMES AND PRICES FRI , (8 & 11<br />\n<br />\nP.M.)

The music is left as a powerful,<br />\nGermanic, romantic statement, and does<br />\nnot attempt to prop itself up with other<br />\nmen's cliches.<br />\nFrom the opening bars,Kleiber suggest<br />\non in an unerring, insistent Allegro. The<br />\nstuttering rubato opening some<br />\nconductors seem so heavily to rely on is<br />\nnot even thought of; it is Kleiber, and<br />\nKleiber alone who guides the orchestra in<br />\nits Beethovenian quest. Like Mahler and<br />\nWagner before him, Kleiber inspires his<br />\norchestra into an unholy furor; one<br />\nwonders if this is really the same orchestra<br />\nKarl Bohm used such a short time ago.<br />\nThe true test of his conceptualization<br />\ncomes in the third movement, and there is<br />\nno question. From the brutal entrance of<br />\nthe horns, to the unremitting force of the<br />\nbasses (in the fugue), the fury and<br />\nrestraint of the symphony is truly evident.<br />\nAnd the almost incredible crescendo<br />\nmarking the opening of the fourth<br />\nmovement is a sonic climax unequalled by<br />\neven Wagner's Leibstod.<br />\nSo I pray? throughout your Bohm, your<br />\nBernstein, you Karajan; save only the<br />\nKlemperer and the Kleiber, and build for<br />\nthem a shrine.

Today we're helping to prepare youngsters for the world that awaits them tomorrow. Not an easy<br />\ntask but one which we welcome.<br />\nAnd how do we go about it? By following the precepts of<br />\nour founder, Don Bosco. To crowd out evil with reason, religion<br />\nand kindness with a method of play, learn and pray.

The<br />\nrumors are flying so thick that everyone<br />\njust KNOWS something great will happen.<br />\nThey'll never stand pat.<br />\nFirst ste: Buffalo.<br />\nRed Holzman\u2014Knicks'General Manager<br />\nis leaving<br />\nRed Holzman\u2014Knicks' Head Coach is<br />\nstaying.<br />\nEddie Donovan\u2014General Manager is<br />\ncoming.<br />\nThat name in New York basketball<br />\ncircles is synonymous with that of any<br />\ndeity you choose. Needless to say the<br />\nmetaphors were prompted by Donovan's<br />\nreturn to the city: his so-called \"Second<br />\nComing.\"<br />\nThe management of Madison Square<br />\nGarden (synonymous with that of both<br />\nthe Knicks and the Rangers) had<br />\nrescued\" him from the perils of that<br />\nbarren wasteland that is Buffalo by means<br />\nof questionable legality, assured that any<br />\nsuch questions that may arise would be<br />\nquashed by the power that is New York in<br />\nSports circles.<br />\nTranslated: No professional sports<br />\nleague stands a chance of survival without<br />\na strong, viable franchise in the Big Apple<br />\nand that gives New Yorkers license to use<br />\nany means at their disposal to accomplish<br />\nthat goal.<br />\nDespite the protests of the Braves'<br />\nmanagement, Donovan was theirs. Could a<br />\ntitle not be far behind? After all wasn't<br />\nthis the genius who brought Frazier, Reed,<br />\nBradley, etc. together on Eighth and<br />\nThirty-third? Didn't he accomplish that<br />\nmaster coup which sent Walt Bellamy and<br />\nButch Komives to Detroit for Dave<br />\nDeBusschere and two eventual NBA titles?<br />\nThe question was not if he would get<br />\nsomeone but rather who?<br />\nNext stop: Indiana via Philadelphia.<br />\nEveryone knew that the NBA rights to<br />\nsuper-forward George McGinnia of the<br />\nABA's Indiana Pacers belonged to the<br />\nPhiladelphia 76ers. Everyone also knew<br />\nthe Knicks needed McGinnis and McGinnis<br />\nwanted to play in New York. So, they<br />\nused that familiar Manhattan rationale<br />\nthat worked so well with Donovan: if you<br />\ncan't get him, take him!<br />\nPress conference, Madison Square<br />\nGarden: President Michael (ex-Yankee)<br />\nBurke and Donovan are very pleased to<br />\nannounce the stealing, er, signing of<br />\nGeorge McGinnis.<br />\nShock waves push Philadelphia closer to<br />\nthe Delaware and are said to have<br />\nextended the crack in the Liberty Bell.<br />\nOnly an admirably forceful move by<br />\nnewly selected NBA Commissioner<br />\nLawrence O'Brien prevented the league<br />\nfrom turning into a monetary free-for-all<br />\nwith the rich (boiling down to N.Y: and<br />\nL.A.) prevailing. O'Brien took a page out<br />\nof Pete Rozelle's book and personally<br />\n\"negotiated\" a trade which sent McGinnis,<br />\n$500,000 and New York's first round<br />\ndraft choice in 1976 to Philadelphia in<br />\nexchange for \"law and order\" in the<br />\nleague.<br />\nA temporary setback for Donovan and<br />\ncrew, felt most New Yorkers, though they<br />\ncursed O'Brien's \"heartlessness.\" Didn't he<br />\nknow the Knicks were only helping the<br />\nleague? After all doesn't he know that<br />\nwasn't Cleveland or Kansas City that he<br />\nwas messing with but rather or New York,<br />\n<br />\nNew York?<br />\nThat's OK. They didn't really want Big<br />\nMac anyway. The Knicks were going after<br />\nbigger game. Game that was six to eight<br />\ninches bigger (depending on who you talk<br />\nto).<br />\nThe initials MM go over big in New<br />\nYork. Who could forget Mantle & Mans or<br />\nthe Manassa Mauler? What better town for<br />\nthe Milwaukee Muslim? Singular because<br />\nhe himself proclaimed there to be an<br />\nabsence of his people in Beertown. He<br />\nwanted to be where the actions was: a<br />\ntown that was more fitting to his<br />\n\"lifestyle\". He wanted New York, where<br />\nhe grew up, or Los Angeles where he went<br />\nto school.<br />\nHe's in LA.<br />\nBecause of their great changes inthe<br />\noff-season and their great upgrading of the<br />\nteam, the Garden mangement took it upon<br />\nthemselves to reward their efforts by<br />\nraising ticket price. After all, how else was<br />\nmanagement going to pay the exorbitant<br />\nsalaries of all the new faces and superstars<br />\nthey'd brought in? $12.50 could hardly be<br />\njudged too high to see the likes of John<br />\nGianelli, Harthorne Wingo and new<br />\nrecruits Eugene Short and Larry Fogle.<br />\nNeedless to say, at this point<br />\nmanagement was getting desperate. For<br />\nthe first time since the DeBusschere trade<br />\nin 1968, nobody was buying Knick season<br />\ntickets. They had to come up with<br />\nsomebody. If they couldn't find him in<br />\npro basketball, look to the college ranks.<br />\nWhat about David Thompson? Atlanta<br />\ndrafted him but couldn't afford to sign<br />\nhim. The Knicks had the money now all<br />\nthey needed were the rights to the former<br />\nN.C. State superstar. Too late, Atlanta<br />\n<br />\nstalled and stalled until Thompson finally<br />\nforsook the NBA for the league with the<br />\npatriotic ball.<br />\nWell, if you can't find him in pro ball,<br />\nand you can't uncover your savior in the<br />\ncollegiate ranks, it's time to look to other<br />\nsports for help. Volleyball for instance.<br />\nAt seven feet plus, 275 pounds plus,<br />\nWilt Chamberlain was the next apparent<br />\nanswer to the Knick's rapidly diminishing<br />\nhopes of attaining immediate<br />\nrespectability. Never mind that he hadn't<br />\nplayed in two years and his rights still<br />\nbelonged to the Lakers. The Knicks<br />\nneeded someone and they needed him<br />\nNOW.<br />\n\"We flew out to<br />\nto meet with Wilt<br />\nand his attorney Sy Goldberg,\" said<br />\nDonovan. \"Sy was there but Wilt never<br />\nshowed. We waited because we owed Wilt<br />\nfirst preference but we had another deal<br />\npending and we couldn't wait forever. So<br />\nwhen Wilt never came,\" the Knick GM<br />\nconcluded,\"we left.\"<br />\nThis was on Wednesday, with the<br />\nseason's opener scheduled for the<br />\nfollowing day and no hope in sight.<br />\nThe fans who had put their hope in<br />\nDonovan were getting slightly traumatic.<br />\nAll of the tantalizing morsels that had<br />\nbeen dangled in front of them were gone<br />\nand they hadn't gotten any. What was<br />\nunthinkable in the spring had seemingly<br />\nbecome inevitable in the fall. For the fans<br />\nthat meant a team that stagnated while<br />\neveryone else improved: last place. For<br />\nmanagement a first: the new Garden with<br />\nempty seats.<br />\nBut the shock had just begun to set in.<br />\nMost people would not realize the true<br />\nsituation until the season began still<br />\nLA<br />\n<br />\nclutching at straws; everlasting faith Eddie<br />\nD. Even on Thursday afternoon as they<br />\nprepared to trek to the \"magic world of<br />\nMadison Square Garden Center\" there was<br />\nfaint hope. Admittedly a dwindling<br />\nflicker. The fuel keeping that flicker lit<br />\nwas that \"other deal\" Donovan spoke of:<br />\nThursday afternoon it came over the<br />\nwire.<br />\nPeople were stunned. Unsure at first.<br />\nLike the guy who's been burned once too<br />\noften. They shied away and tended toward<br />\ndisbelief. But sure enough it was<br />\nconfirmed.<br />\nThe New York Knickerbockers acquired<br />\n6'8\" Spencer Haywood from the Seattle<br />\nSuperSonics in exchange for $1.5 million<br />\ndollars and Eugene Short.<br />\nThe disbelief was justified.<br />\nThe trade makes no sense.<br />\nSeattle doesn't need money. They were<br />\none of only three teams in all of<br />\nprofessional basketball to finish in the<br />\nblack last year. They practically lead the<br />\nleague in season ticket sales. Haywood was<br />\ntheir only established superstar player.<br />\nThe Sonics were on the upswing. Coach<br />\nBill Russell had led them to contender<br />\nstatus in their division. And, with the<br />\nunloading of Haywood all of that seems<br />\nheaded for the sewers. All for a lot of<br />\nexcess cash and a run-and-gun rookie<br />\nforward who's allergic to rebounds.<br />\nGotta give 'em credit. The Knicks did it<br />\nagain. DeBusschere No. 2. Something for<br />\nnothing, New York got its way. Now if<br />\nonly they could solve their fiscal crises as<br />\nsimply.<br />\nAt least now I can go back to being a<br />\nKnick fan. I always knew Eddie could do<br />\nit...What, ME fickle??!!<br />\n<br />\nJays to face Tigers and their brochure<br />\nBy DAVID GORBY<br />\nThe Hopkins football team, hoping to<br />\npick up their second win of the season,<br />\nfaces crosstown rival Towson State tonight<br />\nat 8 p.m. under the lights of Homewood<br />\nField. Last weekend the Blue Jays were<br />\nnarrowly defeated by Salisbury State after<br />\nplaying an emotional and hard-fought<br />\ngame, dropping their record to 1-2-1.<br />\nThe Towson State Tigers, sporting a<br />\n4-2-0 record and a slick and glossy press<br />\nbrochure, are probably one of the<br />\ntoughest teams the Jays will face all<br />\nseason.<br />\nLast year, after completing an<br />\nundefeated season and finishing third on<br />\nthe NCAA Division III offensive charts,<br />\nthe Tigers felt snubbed when the NCAA<br />\nselection committee failed to invite them<br />\nto a post-season bowl game.<br />\nFeeling that a lack of publicity and<br />\nweak opponents thwarted their chances<br />\nfor a bowl appearance in 1974, Towson<br />\nthis year added three new opponents and<br />\nsent out enough press releases and<br />\nbrochures to supply the U.S. Army with<br />\ntoilet paper for a year. Unfortunately the<br />\nTigers' hopes of an undefeated season and<br />\nbowl appearance were dashed as they<br />\ndropped two games in a row. Their<br />\nhype-job went for nought and succeeded<br />\nonly in creating emotionald and mental<br />\nproblems for the team.<br />\nSince their two losses at the beginning<br />\nof the season Towson has not had to<br />\nworry about the post-season and has been<br />\nable to concentrate on the regular season.<br />\nThe Tigers, with 33 lettermen returning,<br />\npossess a well-balanced attack and defense<br />\nwith no glaring deficiencies.<br />\nOffensively they are led by junior<br />\nquarterback Dan Dullea. A graduate of<br />\nLoyola High School, Dullea was one of the<br />\ntop passers in Division III last year. So far<br />\nthis season he has yet to match his super<br />\n974 performance though he has thrown 8<br />\n<br />\ntouchdown passes and represents a<br />\nconstant threat to open up a game.<br />\nThe Tiger offensive backfield, despite<br />\nthe loss of star Larry Jones to graduation,<br />\nis quite solid based primarily on the<br />\nrushing ofjunior tailback James Boyd.<br />\nDefensively, Towson is led by the<br />\noutstanding play of linebacker Jim<br />\nSandusky and defensive tackle Don<br />\nRedman.<br />\nTwo years ago, a highly touted and<br />\nover-confident Towson team traveled to<br />\nHopkins for what they thought would be<br />\nan easy victory. The Hopkins team went<br />\ninto the locker-room at halftime with a<br />\n22-0 lead and went on to win impressively<br />\n33-20.<br />\nLast year the Blue Jays were humiliated<br />\n44-0 and it seems Towson is expecting to<br />\nmeet with an accomodating Hopkins team<br />\nagain this year. Quarterback Dullea feels<br />\n\"It's easier to get up for other games than<br />\nthis one. The better the team, the easier it<br />\nis to get up for them. Not to be `Joe Cool'<br />\nor anything, I really don't get nervous at<br />\nall. I really believe I can turn it on right<br />\n<br />\nImmerim<br />\n<br />\nMINIPIN14.<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nejp\"<br />\n<br />\nbefore kickoff.\" Teammate -Jim<br />\nSanduskey added, \"We just hate<br />\nHopkins,\" with the rest of the team<br />\nechoing those sentiments.<br />\nMembers of the Blue Jay team feel that<br />\nTowson is \"ripe for the pluckin' \".<br />\nCertainly there is no love lost between the<br />\ntwo teams.<br />\nThe Jay with their revamped offense<br />\nwhich has consistently improved over the<br />\ncourse of the season, feel they can win. If<br />\nthe defense can put together a solid four<br />\nquarters it would make the job of the<br />\noffensive unit a great deal easier.<br />\nBlue Jay Coach Dennis Cox feels \"That<br />\nif we play as well defensively as we did<br />\nagainst Salisbury State and if our offense<br />\neliminates the mistakes and is consistent<br />\nthen we can be successful.\"<br />\n\"Last week we made too many mistakes<br />\nbut we showed a good deal of emotion<br />\nand excellent hitting. The hits were some<br />\nof the hardest I've ever seen for a Hopkins<br />\nteam.\" Coach Cox went on to say, \"The<br />\nteam should have no trouble getting up for<br />\nthis game\u2014it means too much.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fCAMPUS NOTES<br />\nHISTORY OF SCI<br />\nUnder the auspices of the Center for History<br />\nand Philosophy of Science, Robert E.

Well, this article has been<br />\nprompted by the fact that three Hopkins<br />\nstudents, Susan Gilbert, Bruce McClay,<br />\nand Terry Vickers, have called for the<br />\nformation of the JHU Gay Caucus, and are<br />\nlooking forward to meeting with the<br /><br />\nHopkins gay community and other<br />\ninterested students in Conference Room B<br />\nof the Student Union Wednesday night at<br />\n7:30 p.m.<br />\nThe JHU Gay Caucus wishes to provide<br />\na supportive and educational atmosphere<br />\nfor gays and straights alike. Its purpose<br />\nwould be to raise the political, social and<br />\npersonal consciousness of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. The JHU Gay Caucus is<br />\napplying for SAC funds,so a good turnout<br />\nat the meeting Wednesday night is crucial.<br />\n(The Kinsey figures state that about ten<br />\nper cent of you people are in some way<br />\ngay. This includes bisexuality.) The<br />\nWomen's Center has already given its<br />\nendorsement of the JHU Gay Caucus,<br />\ncalling it another example of \"personal<br />\nliberation.\" If successful, the JHU Gay<br />\nCaucus would join the already existing<br />\nlarge handful of Baltimore gay<br />\norganizations, including the Baltimore Gay<br />\nAlliance; Dignity, a gay Catholic<br />\norganization; the Baltimore Women's<br />\nLiberation Movement; and, the Lesbian<br />\nCommunity Center.<br />\nTerry Vickers has been active in the<br />\nBaltimore Gay Alliance, and is presently<br />\none of the coordinators for the course<br />\n\"Individual and Societal Growth,\"<br />\nsponsored by the Office of the Chaplain.<br />\nSusan Gilbert is in that course, and<br />\nselected the Metropolitan Community<br />\nChurch, a church ministering especially to<br />\nthe needs of the Christian gay community,<br />\nfor field study. Susan explains that most<br />\nof her friends since her junior year in high<br />\nschool had been gay people, and she had a<br /><br />\ngreat deal of experience with gay<br />\ncounseling. At one time she even<br />\nconsidered going into the gay ministry. As<br />\na possible project with MCC, Susan hopes to be bringing together the males and<br />\nfemales in the gay community. (This<br />\nbegins to raise some interesting questions<br />\nabout what it really means to be gay.)<br />\nBruce McClay explains the need for a<br />\nJHU Gay Caucus by demonstrating the<br />\ndilemma of the gay Hopkins student. He is<br />\ntrying to structure a homosexual lifestyle<br />\nin a heterosexual environment. Obviously,<br />\nhe is rarely successful. He must turn to<br />\nother outlets for his homosexual social<br />\nlife. Here in Baltimore he has the options<br />\nof going to the gay bars, where he stands a<br />\ngood chance of being abused by total<br />\nstrangers, just as he does at various<br />\nsteambaths, or Wyman Park, which is a<br />\nreputed gay \"pick up\" spot, and has also<br />\nrecently been the scene of police<br />\nharrassment toward gays.

Thus, Peking's<br />\nvital interests in the region will be<br />\nendangered. In conclusion China expects<br />\nand Kissinger's statements signal that<br />\nAmerica will be the\" balancer\" of power<br />\nin the current global confrontation.<br />\nIf Americans are confused as to whose<br />\n\"side\" we are on, they need not be<br />\nembarrassed. As supervisor of the peace,<br />\nUncle Sam will at times favor Peking, back<br />\nRussia, or remain uncommitted,<br />\ndepending on the international problem<br />\nand the American interests at stake.<br />\nFor example, at present it seems<br />\nopportune to solidify our position viz-a-viz<br />\nChina inasmuch as: (1) the momentum of<br />\ndetente, despite the much ballyhooed<br />\nwheat deal, has decreased and (2) the<br />\nelderly Chinese leaders who began the<br />\nreconciliation with the United States are<br />\ngradually limiting their diplomatic<br /><br />\n'DOCTOR...IT'S TIME.'<br /><br />\nthose personal tastes which they feel a<br />\nneed to hide. Perhaps you are the woman<br />\nwho goes out of her way to keep her<br />\nrather full sexual life an unknown secret.<br />\nOr, you are the stud who has never had<br />\nany sex of any kind, save for<br />\nmasturbation, his his whole life. No mattei<br />\nwhat the situation, though, to protect our<br />\nown private closets, we all project some<br />\nkind of public sexual image.<br />\nMost of you will at least admit to<br />\nyourselves\u2014in some cases, painful as it<br />\nmay be\u2014that your preferences are really<br />\nbisexual. But publicly you have to project<br />\nsome kind of definite image, which will<br />\nget the message across. Sometimes, gay or<br />\nstraight, one becomes so wrapped up in<br />\nthis public image, that it becomes an<br />\nobsession. The image becomes an extreme.<br />\nYou can't stop hiding from yourself<br />\nuntil you come out of your closet. This is<br />\nwhat the JHU Gay Caucus is all about.<br />\nNot only do you personally have to accept<br />\nyour growth, but society as well must<br />\naccept it, reaffirm your right to do so, and<br />\ngrow with you. As long as you remain in<br />\nyour closet, you are being very unfair to<br />\nyourself. If you can live with that, then<br />\nyou need never worry about your values.<br /><br />\nactivities. Thus Kissinger would like to<br />\ncement our ties with Peking before new<br />\nleaders emerge.<br />\nThis is where the juggling act fits in.<br />\nKissinger must assure Russia that a new<br />\nChinese-American relationship will not<br />\npose a threat to Soviet security or harm<br />\nthe concept of detente. The difference<br />\nbetween diplomacy in a multi-polar world<br />\nand diplomacy in a bi-polar one is<br />\ncomparable to that between chess and<br />\ncheckers: the object of both games is to<br />\nwin, but the strategy is more complex in<br />\nthe former.<br />\nWell, as of now the song is one key, the<br />\nflat tire is off, and the ball is bouncing<br />\nsteadily. Still, Kissinger seems to assume<br />\nthat the rift between Russia and China is<br />\ndeep, so much so that reconciliation in the<br />\nnear future is improbable. Yet, both<br />\ncountries have serious differences with<br />\nWashington over such matters as Taiwan,<br />\nnuclear disarmament, and the Middle East.<br />\nThe Communist titans may tomorrow join<br />\nhands and exclaim a la Bismarck: \"The<br />\nenemy of my enemy is my friend.\"<br />\nHowever, let us assume that the<br />\ncleavage between the two nations is wide.<br />\nOne other phenomena may ironically draw<br />\ntogether the separated (not divorced)<br />\npartners: America's balance of power<br />\nstrategy as practiced by the Secretary of<br />\nState. China and Russia could perceive<br />\nthat their estrangement is only helping one<br />\ncountry\u2014the United States. Moreover,<br />\nboth may react to a situation where the<br />\n\"balancer\" pits one nation against the<br />\nother, improves relations with both, and<br />\nincreases her global influence at their<br />\nexpanse. That is, as the American strategic<br />\nposition improves, the Communist stances<br />\nweaken.<br />\nAnd, with the Secretary of Defense<br />\nclamoring for a restoration of monetary<br />\ncuts in a svelte $90 billion military budget,<br />\nit should surprise no one, least of all<br />\nKissinger, if the Big Bear and the Yellow<br />\nStar begin a rapprochement of their own.<br /><br />\nread any further. If, on the other hand,<br />\nyou like your corned beef piled high<br />\nbetween two slices of rye drenched with<br />\nmustard, then Jack's of Lombard Street<br />\nmay be your kind of place:<br />\nOnly Three<br />\nThe 1000 and 1100 blocks of East<br />\nLombard Street used to be lined with<br />\ndelicatessens. Now there are only three<br />\nleft. Jack's is the largest operation. Drive<br />\ndown to East Baltimore in the middle of<br />\nthe day (you'll wait forever if you try to<br />\ngo by bus); search for a parking space in<br />\nJack's crowded lot or along traffic-choked<br />\nLombard St.; avoid stepping on a wino<br />\nwhen you walk in the door; resist the<br />\ntemptation to buy a state lottery ticket<br />\nfrom the machine which catches your eye.<br />\nFine. You've made it to Jack's fast food<br />\nline. Now you are ready to choose from a<br />\ntempting selection of sandwiches: corned<br />\nbeef, roast beef, rare beef, turkey, salami,<br />\nand (you should pardon the expression)<br />\nham.They all cost about a dollar; if you're<br />\na stickler for lean corned beef, it'll cost a<br />\nquarter extra. But Jack's regular 99-cent<br />\nedition is lean enough for my taste.<br />\nPastrami<br />\nIf you desire a hot pastrami, the. other<br />\nmember of the Jack's pantheon, it will<br />\ntake a little longer. You'll be directed a<br />\nlittle further down the counter where the<br />\nhot dogs and kishka hold sway. There, on<br />\na grill last cleaned during FDR's third term<br />\n(just kidding, Jack; call off the lawyers),<br />\nyou may watch one of the genial<br />\nemployees heat up the pastrami. Now, you<br />\ncan buy a quarter pound of pastrami for<br />\n59 cents\u2014which is roughly the amoung<br />\nJack's gives you on his 99-cent<br />\nsandwich\u2014but it won't be the same<br />\nquality. You know he's making a slight<br />\nprofit, but one taste of a Jack's hot<br />\npastrami on rye will convince you it's<br />\nworth it. The two critics accompanying<br />\nme on this visit compared the place<br />\nfavorably with the 'famous Premier Deily<br />\nin The Hub and with Brooklyn's renowned<br />\nSchmulka Bernstein's, which is saying<br />\nsomething. All I know is that there ain't<br />\nno way you're gonna get a sandwich as<br />\ngood as one of Jack's creations around<br />\nHomewood. (There should be a shuttle<br />\nservice from this campus down to<br />\nLombard st.!)<br /><br />\npage 4/news-letter/october 24, 1975<br /><br />\nCaledonian study is better than drinking at the Rat<br />\nblame them a bit for putting ice in it. I<br />\ncouldn't drink the stuff here any other<br />\nway, either. But a single malt whiskey is<br />\nsmooth and a sip should be safored just as<br />\na wine lover enjoys his drink. Ice is<br />\nsacrilegious. It's no wonder we don't get<br />\nany in the States. It's too precious to<br />\nexport.<br />\nGoing to the University was enjoyable. I<br />\nhad my first full year of intellectual<br />\nhappiness. The system there is different,<br />\nbut not so much that I had any problems.<br />\nThe nicest thing about it was the low-key<br />\napproach to education. Could any<br />\nHopkins student conceive of a University<br />\nwhose library closed at ten on Fridays and<br />\ndidn't open again until eight Monday<br />\nmorning? But I wouldn't say that the<br />\naverage Edinburgh student was any less<br />\nqualified or trained than the average<br />\nHopkins student. I would say that the<br />\naverage Edinburgh student knew a lot<br />\nmore about Edinburgh than Hopkins<br />\nstudents know about Baltimore.<br />\nI had a tutor there who was also one of<br />\nthe lecturers for one of my courses. He<br />\nused to kid me about being an American<br />\nin tutorial, and one day he told a joke in<br />\nclass that, in a way, was pretty true about<br />\nmost visiting Americans. He recalled the<br />\nsong from WWI \"Over There.\" But the<br />\nBritish used to sing it this way:\"Overpaid,<br /><br />\nStuart Pregnall<br /><br />\nStuart Pregnall, a Hopkins senior, spent<br />\nlast year studying at Edinburgh, Scotland.<br />\nWe offer following some excerpts of his<br />\nrecollections of an experience which he<br />\nsays he \"will never forget.\"<br />\nThere's so much\u2014castles, whiskey,<br />\nheather, kilts, ceilidhs, lochs, kings, Gaelic,<br />\nScottish Nationalist Party, rugby, haggis,<br />\nRabbie Burns, bagpipes, pubs, the<br />\nHighlands, sheep, tartans, do they speak<br />\nEnglish, what do they wear under a kilt,<br />\nwas golf really invented in Scotland,<br />\nwasn't Andrew Carnegie born in<br />\nDunfermline, real beer, fish and chips,<br />\nsmoked salmon, the moors, peat bogs, the<br />\nmountains<br />\nI spent every weekend away from<br />\nEdinburgh, not because I didn't like it, but<br />\nbecause the hills called me. I saw most of<br />\nScotland looking off the top of a<br />\nmountain into a clear sky. An old adage<br />\nis \"If ye can see th' hills, its gang tae rain,<br />\nif ye cannae see th' hills, it's raining.\" It<br />\nturned out to be true. The only weekend I<br />\nhad dry feet was the time it rained solid<br />\nfor three days and I never budged from<br />\nmy tent. But when it isn't raining,<br />\nScotland is exquisitely beautiful.<br />\nThe colors change constantly with the<br />\nchanging sky and seasons. I remember the<br />\nnight I went to sleep looking toward a few<br />\nhills I had to cross the next day and<br />\nthinking what a pleasant walk it would be.<br />\nI could see that the bracken was brown,<br />\ndead, and broken and would be easy to<br />\nwalk through. I could also see the darker<br />\nbrown of the heather, which meant fairly<br />\ndry ground. The following morning I<br />\nawoke to discover that it had snowed<br />\nduring the night and my pleasant walk<br />\nturned into a snow plod. As I stood on top<br />\nof Ben Alder later that day, I could see<br />\ndown into the corries through the glen and<br />\nacross the Rannoch moor all the way to<br />\nGlencoe. I'll always remember it.<br />\nScottish beer is the best in the world,<br />\nbut before you'll believe me, I'll have to<br />\nqualify that a little. Some Scottish beer<br />\ntastes worse than most American beer,<br />\nwhich in my opinion is pretty bad. But<br />\nreal Scottish ale is something that you can<br />\ndrink and enjoy. The Real Ale movement<br />\nis fairly large, and it's worth the extra<br />\nmoney to drink a pint of Belhaven's heavy<br />\ndrawn from the wood. It's dark, not fizzy,<br />\nand has a nutty flavor that is very<br />\nwelcome after drinking comparatively<br />\ntasteless Schlitz. Belhaven's is a small<br />\nbrewery\u2014they don't deliver anywhere<br />\noutside of Edinburgh; there are six<br />\nbreweries in the city. At night, when the<br />\nmist is in off the Firth of Forth and the<br />\nfog lamps are on, the damp air carries the<br />\nsmell of the barley cooking.<br />\nThe site of the Edinburgh castle has<br />\nbeen a fortified encampment since Pictish<br />\ntimes. The castle sits on top of a volcanic<br />\nplug and is approachable from one side<br />\nonly. It was taken by force once\u2014when an<br />\nEnglish garrison was overthrown after a<br />\ndozen Scots had scaled the 300 foot cliff<br />\nduring a storm one night and surprised the<br />\nSassenachs. The Scottish Crown Jewels are<br />\nthere, and although they aren't as<br />\nresplendent as the English Crown Jewels,<br />\nthey're older and more dignified. Mons<br />\nMeg looms over the city from the castle.<br />\nShe's a cannon that could blast a stone<br />\nball weighing 180 pounds \"a' the way<br />\ndoon tae th' Forth.\" I lived under the<br />\ncastle and could see it reflected in the<br />\nwindow of the building next door.<br />\nMy local pub, the White Horse Inn, is an<br />\nold pub that's been redone since Bums<br />\nand Scott used to drink there, but it's still<br />\na nice place to drink a few whiskeys. The<br />\nbargirl used to think it funny that I was an<br />\nAmerican who insisted on either Glen<br />\nMorangie or Bruichladdich malts. , Most<br />\ntourists go in and drink some whiskey<br />\nthey can get here in the States, and I don't<br /><br />\nFrom my front door<br /><br />\nj11,1,11.1\u00b0<br />\nTi<br />\nEdinburgh Castle<br />\nover-sexed, and over here.\" It was still<br />\noperative last year. The Americans did<br />\nseem to have twice as much money as<br />\nanyone else, and I guess that to a lot of<br />\npeople we seemed oversexed. One girl told<br />\nme that there was some stigma attached to<br />\nan American accent that meant being<br />\ntemporary, and temporary meant<br />\npredatory, and predatory meant<br />\noversexed. Sounds like the Rat to me.<br />\nThe first time I wore a kilt, I was not a<br />\nlittle embarrassed. I was aware of being in<br />\nwhat was essentially a dress. However,<br />\ncomfort and simplicity soon disposed of<br />\nmy self-consciousness. A kilt is a<br />\nwonderful garment. It's warm, which is<br />\nnecessary for Scotland, and lasts for years.<br />\nAnd once you know what it's like, it's as<br />\nnormal as wearing jeans.<br />\nMy first attempt at playing the bagpipes<br />\nwasn't an artistic success, but it was fun. I<br />\nwas at a Burns supper, and had been<br />\ncajoled into reading some of his poetry,<br />\nmy tongue being lubricated by half a<br />\nbottle of whiskey. By this time I'd learned<br />\nhow to drink half a bottle of whiskey and<br />\nnot be drunk. Well, not too drunk. I asked<br />\nif I could have a go at the bagpipes, and<br />\nwas told I could. I was handed the<br />\ndeflated pipes and shown how to fill them<br />\nand how to get the drones to produce a<br />\ncontinuous sound. Once that was<br />\nmastered, there was still the chanter to<br />\nplay the tune on, and that's where<br />\neverything fell apart. I used to play the<br /><br />\nclarinet, and tried to play the pipes the<br />\nsame way. Well, with the pipes, it's a blow<br />\nand squeeze, blow and squeeze kind of<br />\noperation, and all I did was blow. Well,<br />\nsince I'd already filled the bag to capacity,<br />\nI was just blowing against myself, and I<br />\ngot red in the face. My. friends were<br />\nlaughing more and more, and I kept<br />\nblowing, and they kept laughing, and<br />\nfinally I had to give up. My cheeks were<br />\nsore and my chest hurt from so much<br />\npressure. When the laughter subsided I was<br />\ntold what I was doing wrong, and after<br />\nthat managed the pipes a little better.<br />\nI had a very large and sore blister and so<br />\nwent to the chemists for a bandage. I'd<br />\nbeen in Edinburgh for about a month by<br />\nthat time, and was beginning to feel prettY<br />\nworldly and sure of what I was doing. So I<br />\nwalked in and asked for sticking plasters.<br />\nI'm a follower of the British action novel,<br />\nand like everyone else, know that at night<br />\nduring the storm when the good guy is<br />\nsneaking about, he covers the face of his<br />\nelectric torch with sticking plaster so there<br />\nwon't be a wide beam of light.<br />\nThe lady was very nice. She didn't<br />\nguffaw, which she was entitled to do. She<br />\ndidn't even snicker. She just sat there,<br />\nsmiled sweetly, and said, \"Oh, you want<br />\nsome Band-Aids.\" It did nothing to salvage<br />\nthat experience to note that Johnson &amp;<br />\nJohnson of London labeled their tin<br />\n\"Band-Aid Sticking Plasters.\"<br /><br />\nCapsule reviews of the hot numbers<br />\nBy J.D. CONSIDINE<br />\nPaul Simon Still Crazy After All These<br />\nYears(Columbia)<br />\nSeveral years ago it was said that when<br />\nArt Garfunkel and Paul Simon broke up, it<br />\nwould be obvious where the real talent in<br />\nthe group was. Well, it certainly showed<br />\nwhere the talent wasn't.<br />\nI was always very fond of Simon and<br />\nGarfunkel, but Paul Simon's albums left<br />\nme cold. Sure, the singles were nice, but<br />\nthe albums as a whole never really had it.<br />\nOn this, his newest, Paul comes closest,<br />\nyet ultimately fails.<br />\nThere are some interesting pairing on<br />\nthe album, both of which have been<br />\nsingles. My Little Town,the current single,<br />\nreunites the old duo, and is very nice. But.<br />\nThe subtleties are not really there; the<br />\nharmonies are forced; the sound too<br />\nproduced. Steve Matthew's horn<br />\narrangement is superb, but lacks the fun of<br />\nKeeping the Customer Satisfied.<br />\nGone at Last, with Phoebe Snow, is an<br />\nenjoyable, pseudo-gospel tune, somewhat<br />\nlike the things Simon has done with the<br />\nGospel group he tours with. But it's not<br />\nthem, and instead of sounding like the<br />\nholy-rolling Baptists, it comes off as<br />\nwhite -bread -and -mayonnaise<br /><br />\nPresbyterianism.<br />\n50 ways to leave your lover is my<br />\nfavorite on the album. It's cure and<br />\ncatchy, well done and toe-tappable. As for<br />\nthe rest of the album, I'm disappointed.<br />\nThere are some very fine people there,<br />\nincluding Toots Thielmans, Phil Woods,<br />\nand the Brecker Brothers, and I know I<br />\nshould love it, but I don't. This is not to<br />\nsay \"don't buy it,\" because if you like<br />\nSimon's stuff, you'll like this; I just<br />\nwanted more.<br />\nJohn Denver Windsong(RCA)<br />\nSurely you jest. If you like John<br />\nDenver, you'll like this. If you don't, you<br />\nwon't. Like all country music, this album<br />\nis deja-ecoute, and let us not forget that<br />\nDenver's was the Country Music Awards'<br />\nbiggest winner.<br />\nSo if what you want is a formulaic<br />\ncompilation of clean air songs, polished<br />\nwith down-homeness, and balanced barely<br />\nconcealed anti-intellectuality, he's your<br />\nboy.

Neither seem<br />\nlikely to succeed.<br />\nSplit Cocoanut is a pretty dull album, less<br />\ninteresting than his last.

DeVillier danced 3780 hours.<br />\nsetting a new world's record for the<br />\nlongest dance marathon. For their greedy<br />\nefforts, the couple, whose only motive was<br />\nmoney, won $10,000 and instantly<br />\nbecame American folk heroes. Vonnie.and<br />\nCallum parlayed their popularity into a<br />\nsizable fortuneland retired to a quiet farm<br />\nin the San Fernando Valley, but remained<br />\nan inspiration to thousands of<br />\nmoney-hungry couples who desperately<br />\ndegraded themselves to win dance<br />\nmarathons just for a few bucks. This<br />\nmadness led the reactionary evangilist<br />\nAimee Semple McPherson to say, \"I<br />\nbelieve that sterilization is the only means<br />\nof protecting our people from this<br />\nidiocy.\" Luckily the government was<br />\nnever forced to such radical measures<br />\nbecause dance marathons slowly died<br />\nduring World War II due to a serious<br />\nshortage of male partners and the fact that<br />\neverybody had money again.<br />\nIn great contrast to these ridiculous,<br />\nhumiliating spectacles, Dance Around the<br />\nClock, sponsored by the Maryland<br />\nAssociation for Retarded Citizens, is a<br />\ndance marathon based on generosity, not<br />\ngreed. Even though there is a Grand Prize<br />\nof $1000 (second place is worth $500 and<br />\nthird, $250), the matter of prizes seems<br />\nirrelevant in light of the overall purpose of<br />\nthe marathon. Never before have Hopkins<br />\nstudents been given so easy a chance to<br />\nshow their generosity and, at the same<br />\ntime, enjoy themselves.<br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\nMaryland private colleges<br />\nTo receive aid boost in '77<br />\nBy BOB BUCHANAN<br />\nState aid to Maryland Private Colleges<br />\nwill increase 13 per cent in fiscal year<br />\n1977, supplying a much-needed boost in<br />\nrevenues for Hopkins and other private<br />\nschools, Budget Director Norman Krueger<br />\ndisclosed yesterday.<br />\nHopkins will be receiving the funds next<br />\nyear because of an increase in the<br />\nallocations to State schools.

Baker cited the poor<br />\ncoverage Eugene McCarthy received prior<br />\nto his strong showing in the New<br /><br />\nHampshire primary in 1968 as an example<br />\nof the bias against people whose ideas are<br />\nconsidered out of the mainstream of<br />\nthought.<br />\nAlways the hard-headed realist, Baker<br />\nexpressed his pessimism regarding the fate<br />\nof anyone who tried to be more open to<br />\nthese \"alternatives\" (such as socialism):<br />\n\"If you try, you won't last long as a<br />\nsyndicated columnist.\"<br />\nRecounting<br />\nRecounting his own career, Baker stated<br />\nthat he was responsible for the<br />\nNews-Letter's tabloid format, \"which<br />\nhasn't changed at all since 1947.\" After 15<br />\nyears as a reporter, he had expressed to<br />\nthe editor at the Times his discontent,<br />\nwhereupon he was asked to write a<br />\ncolumn to succeed \"Topics of the Times,\"<br />\nwhich \"copyboys were writing for $15 a<br />\nthrow\" and which \"nobody had read for<br />\nthirty years.\" Arthur Krock, C. L.<br />\nSulzberger, and James Reston wrote the<br />\nTimes columns on national and<br />\ninternational affairs. Baker's column was<br />\nto be \"the nothing column\"\u2014he chose the<br />\ncockroach as his first therm in \"The<br />\nObserver.\" Since Baker used short,<br />\nAnglo-Saxon words in short sentences, in<br />\nmarked contrast to the ponderous<br />\nLatinate style of the Times, people did not<br /><br />\ntake his column seriously. After Times,<br />\nmagazine labelled him a humorist, Baker<br />\nsaid he could not break the mold.<br />\nDuring the course of the Symposium,<br />\nBaker adroitly handled the questions fired<br />\nat him, taking time out to comment on<br />\nthe student paper and to chide Professor<br />\nGordon Wolman\u2014a newspaper associate of<br />\nBaker's in their student days here\u2014for<br />\nlabeling him a cynic.<br />\nThe Average<br />\nBut, quoting Ambrose Bierce's definition<br />\nof cynicism\u2014\"that blackguard defect of<br />\nvision which compels us to see the world<br />\nas it is rather than as it should be\"\u2014he<br />\nadmitted the relevance of the charge. \"I've<br />\nalways seen the world as it is.\"<br />\nIn a candid discussion of his work<br />\nhabits, Baker admitted that he \"hits for<br />\nthe average\" and does not worry about<br />\nturning out a masterpiece three times a<br />\nweek.<br />\nBaker declared at one point his<br />\nadmiration for the European press, which<br />\n\"chucks the pretense of objectivity.\"<br />\nCertainly, no one would ever accuse Baker<br />\nof objectivity.

The largest<br />\npercentage of these grants at Hopkins are<br />\ninvariably awarded to researchers in the<br />\nArts and Science Division.<br />\nKrueger warned, \"The National Science<br />\nFoundation's attitude towards indirect<br />\ncost recoveries is somewhat archaic.

If you've never heard pure energy,<br />\nhere's your chance.<br />\nTony Williams was, at age 13, working<br />\nBoston clubs with Sam Rivers. At 17, he<br />\nwas Miles' drummer. And in 1968, he<br />\nformed his own band, .Tony William's<br />\nLifetime.<br /><br />\nThe first band consisted of Tony on<br />\ndrums, Larry Young on organ, John<br />\nMcLaughlin on guitar, and (occasionally)<br />\nJack Bruce on bass. It was Tony's band<br />\nthat brought McLaughlin to the U.S., and<br />\nit was Tony was introduced him to Miles.<br />\nMiles put him with Billy Cobham (A<br />\nTribute to Jack Johnson), and the rest is<br />\nhistory.<br />\nWhat is generally unknown, though, is<br />\nthat Tony was playing in 1968 what<br />\nCobham is playing today. Despite the<br />\npuffs, Tony Williams is this generation's<br />\nBuddy Rich. And if the Stanley Clarke<br />\nalbum didn't prove that, this will.<br />\nThe New Tony William's Lifetime<br />\nconsists of almost totally unknown<br />\nmusicians. Allan Holdworth, their<br />\nguitarist, is more than another guitarist,<br />\nmore than another McLaughlin. Where<br />\nMcLaughlin is fast, he is fast in an<br />\nantiseptic Segovian way. Holdsworth is<br />\nfast, fast as Coltrane, but with Trane's<br />\ntenor sax roughness, an electric gut-bucket<br />\nguitar.<br />\nThe group's Material ranges from<br />\nsupercharged superfunk, to pure energy<br />\nrock. Although they at first seem to lack<br />\nthe textural clarity of the McLaughlin<br />\n[coup, it soon becomes apparant that<br />\nTony's band has the beauty of jagged<br />\ncrystal, not Mahavishnu's lucite<br />\nsmoothness. And the difference is what<br />\nseparates Great Black Music from merely<br />\nGreat Music.<br />\nThe album will probably be a sleeper.<br />\nBut then, so was Inner Mounting Flame.<br />\nStanley Clarke Journey to Love<br />\n(Nemporer)<br />\nStanley's first album, Children of<br />\nForever, was a dog that was cut out of the<br />\ncatologue in four months. His second<br />\nalbum, Stanley Clarke, was a smash hit.<br />\nThis album will also be a smash hit, even<br />\nthough it doesn't deserve it.<br /><br />\nINFO &amp; PHONE CHARGES: CALL (301) 363-0800<br /><br />\nTIMES AND PRICES FRI , (8 &amp; 11<br /><br />\nP.M.)

The music is left as a powerful,<br />\nGermanic, romantic statement, and does<br />\nnot attempt to prop itself up with other<br />\nmen's cliches.<br />\nFrom the opening bars,Kleiber suggest<br />\non in an unerring, insistent Allegro. The<br />\nstuttering rubato opening some<br />\nconductors seem so heavily to rely on is<br />\nnot even thought of; it is Kleiber, and<br />\nKleiber alone who guides the orchestra in<br />\nits Beethovenian quest. Like Mahler and<br />\nWagner before him, Kleiber inspires his<br />\norchestra into an unholy furor; one<br />\nwonders if this is really the same orchestra<br />\nKarl Bohm used such a short time ago.<br />\nThe true test of his conceptualization<br />\ncomes in the third movement, and there is<br />\nno question. From the brutal entrance of<br />\nthe horns, to the unremitting force of the<br />\nbasses (in the fugue), the fury and<br />\nrestraint of the symphony is truly evident.<br />\nAnd the almost incredible crescendo<br />\nmarking the opening of the fourth<br />\nmovement is a sonic climax unequalled by<br />\neven Wagner's Leibstod.<br />\nSo I pray? throughout your Bohm, your<br />\nBernstein, you Karajan; save only the<br />\nKlemperer and the Kleiber, and build for<br />\nthem a shrine.

The Red Sox were not expected to<br />\ngo the distance against the potent<br />\nCincinnati hitting.<br />\nBut the Sox had a superior offense with<br />\nthe likes of Carl Yaztremski and Rico<br />\nPetrocelli, from the \"Impossible Dream\"<br />\nteam of '67, still providing leadership for<br />\nthe young Boston squad, the likes of<br />\nwhich include rookie Fred Lynn and Jim<br />\nRice. Rice was sidelined from the World<br />\nSeries in the late stages of the season when<br />\nhe was struck on the wrist by a pitch in a<br />\ngame with Detroit. Whether his big bat<br />\nwas missing from the Bosox line-up is a<br />\nquestion to think about this winter.<br />\nLynn had an excellent series both<br />\noffensively and defensively. Lynn belted a<br />\nfirst inning homer with two on in game six<br />\nand made difficult catches in his familiar<br />\nterritory, center field of Fenway Park.<br />\nThe Reds did not have as many<br />\nconsistently high hitting batters in the<br />\nentire series except for Mr. Baseball, Pete<br />\nRose.

Perhaps,<br />\nit could be you as a Salesian<br />\nPriest or Brother.<br />\nThe Salesians of St. John<br />\nBosco were founded in 1859 to<br />\nserve youth.

Today we're helping to prepare youngsters for the world that awaits them tomorrow. Not an easy<br />\ntask but one which we welcome.<br />\nAnd how do we go about it? By following the precepts of<br />\nour founder, Don Bosco. To crowd out evil with reason, religion<br />\nand kindness with a method of play, learn and pray. We're<br />\ntrying to build better communities by helping to create better men.<br />\nAs a Salesian, you are guaranteed the chance to help<br />\n... as guidance counselthe young in a wide range of endeavor.<br />\nors, technical and academic teachers, as coaches,<br />\npsychologists ... in boys clubs, summer camps ... as missionaries.

I<br />\ncan't help but think that people have very<br />\nshort memories if they remember the<br />\nMiracle Mets of'69.<br />\nThe height of the drama came in the<br />\nsixth game when Boston came from three<br />\nruns down to tie the game in the last of<br />\nthe eighth and eventually go on to win the<br />\ngame in extra innings.<br />\nIt was in that inning that Bernie Carbo<br />\nwas called on by Johnson to pinch hit and<br />\nBernie came through with a three run blast<br />\nto left-center field. It was his second home<br />\nrun of the series against the National<br />\nLeague champs, the team that originally<br />\ndrafted him.<br />\nCarlton Fisk, the Bosox catcher who<br />\nwas involved in the controversial call in<br />\ngame three in which a \"collision\" took<br />\nplace with Cincinnati hitter Ed Armbrister<br />\nin front of the plate, came through with<br />\nan extra inning home run that sent the<br />\nseries into the seventh game.<br />\nThe series was evenly played by both<br />\necisive<br />\nm<br />\nteams although the Reds<br /><br />\nUp until the sixth, Boston seemed to be<br />\nin firm control with their three run lead.<br />\nBoston took advantage of the poor control<br />\nof Reds' starter Don Gullett in the third<br />\ninning and scored three times.

As comical (substitute sad Knick<br />\nfans) as being eliminated by the Houston<br />\nRockets in the frontcourt that took Coach<br />\nRed Holzman's troops that far.<br />\nAll eyes point toward next year. The<br />\nrumors are flying so thick that everyone<br />\njust KNOWS something great will happen.<br />\nThey'll never stand pat.<br />\nFirst ste: Buffalo.<br />\nRed Holzman\u2014Knicks'General Manager<br />\nis leaving<br />\nRed Holzman\u2014Knicks' Head Coach is<br />\nstaying.<br />\nEddie Donovan\u2014General Manager is<br />\ncoming.<br />\nThat name in New York basketball<br />\ncircles is synonymous with that of any<br />\ndeity you choose. Needless to say the<br />\nmetaphors were prompted by Donovan's<br />\nreturn to the city: his so-called \"Second<br />\nComing.\"<br />\nThe management of Madison Square<br />\nGarden (synonymous with that of both<br />\nthe Knicks and the Rangers) had<br />\nrescued\" him from the perils of that<br />\nbarren wasteland that is Buffalo by means<br />\nof questionable legality, assured that any<br />\nsuch questions that may arise would be<br />\nquashed by the power that is New York in<br />\nSports circles.<br />\nTranslated: No professional sports<br />\nleague stands a chance of survival without<br />\na strong, viable franchise in the Big Apple<br />\nand that gives New Yorkers license to use<br />\nany means at their disposal to accomplish<br />\nthat goal.<br />\nDespite the protests of the Braves'<br />\nmanagement, Donovan was theirs. Could a<br />\ntitle not be far behind? After all wasn't<br />\nthis the genius who brought Frazier, Reed,<br />\nBradley, etc. together on Eighth and<br />\nThirty-third? Didn't he accomplish that<br />\nmaster coup which sent Walt Bellamy and<br />\nButch Komives to Detroit for Dave<br />\nDeBusschere and two eventual NBA titles?<br />\nThe question was not if he would get<br />\nsomeone but rather who?<br />\nNext stop: Indiana via Philadelphia.<br />\nEveryone knew that the NBA rights to<br />\nsuper-forward George McGinnia of the<br />\nABA's Indiana Pacers belonged to the<br />\nPhiladelphia 76ers. Everyone also knew<br />\nthe Knicks needed McGinnis and McGinnis<br />\nwanted to play in New York. So, they<br />\nused that familiar Manhattan rationale<br />\nthat worked so well with Donovan: if you<br />\ncan't get him, take him!<br />\nPress conference, Madison Square<br />\nGarden: President Michael (ex-Yankee)<br />\nBurke and Donovan are very pleased to<br />\nannounce the stealing, er, signing of<br />\nGeorge McGinnis.<br />\nShock waves push Philadelphia closer to<br />\nthe Delaware and are said to have<br />\nextended the crack in the Liberty Bell.<br />\nOnly an admirably forceful move by<br />\nnewly selected NBA Commissioner<br />\nLawrence O'Brien prevented the league<br />\nfrom turning into a monetary free-for-all<br />\nwith the rich (boiling down to N.Y: and<br />\nL.A.) prevailing. O'Brien took a page out<br />\nof Pete Rozelle's book and personally<br />\n\"negotiated\" a trade which sent McGinnis,<br />\n$500,000 and New York's first round<br />\ndraft choice in 1976 to Philadelphia in<br />\nexchange for \"law and order\" in the<br />\nleague.<br />\nA temporary setback for Donovan and<br />\ncrew, felt most New Yorkers, though they<br />\ncursed O'Brien's \"heartlessness.\" Didn't he<br />\nknow the Knicks were only helping the<br />\nleague? After all doesn't he know that<br />\nwasn't Cleveland or Kansas City that he<br />\nwas messing with but rather or New York,<br /><br />\nNew York?<br />\nThat's OK. They didn't really want Big<br />\nMac anyway. The Knicks were going after<br />\nbigger game. Game that was six to eight<br />\ninches bigger (depending on who you talk<br />\nto).<br />\nThe initials MM go over big in New<br />\nYork. Who could forget Mantle &amp; Mans or<br />\nthe Manassa Mauler? What better town for<br />\nthe Milwaukee Muslim? Singular because<br />\nhe himself proclaimed there to be an<br />\nabsence of his people in Beertown. He<br />\nwanted to be where the actions was: a<br />\ntown that was more fitting to his<br />\n\"lifestyle\". He wanted New York, where<br />\nhe grew up, or Los Angeles where he went<br />\nto school.<br />\nHe's in LA.<br />\nBecause of their great changes inthe<br />\noff-season and their great upgrading of the<br />\nteam, the Garden mangement took it upon<br />\nthemselves to reward their efforts by<br />\nraising ticket price. After all, how else was<br />\nmanagement going to pay the exorbitant<br />\nsalaries of all the new faces and superstars<br />\nthey'd brought in? $12.50 could hardly be<br />\njudged too high to see the likes of John<br />\nGianelli, Harthorne Wingo and new<br />\nrecruits Eugene Short and Larry Fogle.<br />\nNeedless to say, at this point<br />\nmanagement was getting desperate. For<br />\nthe first time since the DeBusschere trade<br />\nin 1968, nobody was buying Knick season<br />\ntickets. They had to come up with<br />\nsomebody. If they couldn't find him in<br />\npro basketball, look to the college ranks.<br />\nWhat about David Thompson? Atlanta<br />\ndrafted him but couldn't afford to sign<br />\nhim. The Knicks had the money now all<br />\nthey needed were the rights to the former<br />\nN.C. State superstar. Too late, Atlanta<br /><br />\nstalled and stalled until Thompson finally<br />\nforsook the NBA for the league with the<br />\npatriotic ball.<br />\nWell, if you can't find him in pro ball,<br />\nand you can't uncover your savior in the<br />\ncollegiate ranks, it's time to look to other<br />\nsports for help. Volleyball for instance.<br />\nAt seven feet plus, 275 pounds plus,<br />\nWilt Chamberlain was the next apparent<br />\nanswer to the Knick's rapidly diminishing<br />\nhopes of attaining immediate<br />\nrespectability. Never mind that he hadn't<br />\nplayed in two years and his rights still<br />\nbelonged to the Lakers. The Knicks<br />\nneeded someone and they needed him<br />\nNOW.<br />\n\"We flew out to<br />\nto meet with Wilt<br />\nand his attorney Sy Goldberg,\" said<br />\nDonovan. \"Sy was there but Wilt never<br />\nshowed. We waited because we owed Wilt<br />\nfirst preference but we had another deal<br />\npending and we couldn't wait forever. So<br />\nwhen Wilt never came,\" the Knick GM<br />\nconcluded,\"we left.\"<br />\nThis was on Wednesday, with the<br />\nseason's opener scheduled for the<br />\nfollowing day and no hope in sight.<br />\nThe fans who had put their hope in<br />\nDonovan were getting slightly traumatic.<br />\nAll of the tantalizing morsels that had<br />\nbeen dangled in front of them were gone<br />\nand they hadn't gotten any. What was<br />\nunthinkable in the spring had seemingly<br />\nbecome inevitable in the fall. For the fans<br />\nthat meant a team that stagnated while<br />\neveryone else improved: last place. For<br />\nmanagement a first: the new Garden with<br />\nempty seats.<br />\nBut the shock had just begun to set in.<br />\nMost people would not realize the true<br />\nsituation until the season began still<br />\nLA<br /><br />\nclutching at straws; everlasting faith Eddie<br />\nD. Even on Thursday afternoon as they<br />\nprepared to trek to the \"magic world of<br />\nMadison Square Garden Center\" there was<br />\nfaint hope. Admittedly a dwindling<br />\nflicker. The fuel keeping that flicker lit<br />\nwas that \"other deal\" Donovan spoke of:<br />\nThursday afternoon it came over the<br />\nwire.<br />\nPeople were stunned. Unsure at first.<br />\nLike the guy who's been burned once too<br />\noften. They shied away and tended toward<br />\ndisbelief. But sure enough it was<br />\nconfirmed.<br />\nThe New York Knickerbockers acquired<br />\n6'8\" Spencer Haywood from the Seattle<br />\nSuperSonics in exchange for $1.5 million<br />\ndollars and Eugene Short.<br />\nThe disbelief was justified.<br />\nThe trade makes no sense.<br />\nSeattle doesn't need money. They were<br />\none of only three teams in all of<br />\nprofessional basketball to finish in the<br />\nblack last year. They practically lead the<br />\nleague in season ticket sales. Haywood was<br />\ntheir only established superstar player.<br />\nThe Sonics were on the upswing. Coach<br />\nBill Russell had led them to contender<br />\nstatus in their division. And, with the<br />\nunloading of Haywood all of that seems<br />\nheaded for the sewers. All for a lot of<br />\nexcess cash and a run-and-gun rookie<br />\nforward who's allergic to rebounds.<br />\nGotta give 'em credit. The Knicks did it<br />\nagain. DeBusschere No. 2. Something for<br />\nnothing, New York got its way. Now if<br />\nonly they could solve their fiscal crises as<br />\nsimply.<br />\nAt least now I can go back to being a<br />\nKnick fan.

Last weekend the Blue Jays were<br />\nnarrowly defeated by Salisbury State after<br />\nplaying an emotional and hard-fought<br />\ngame, dropping their record to 1-2-1.<br />\nThe Towson State Tigers, sporting a<br />\n4-2-0 record and a slick and glossy press<br />\nbrochure, are probably one of the<br />\ntoughest teams the Jays will face all<br />\nseason.<br />\nLast year, after completing an<br />\nundefeated season and finishing third on<br />\nthe NCAA Division III offensive charts,<br />\nthe Tigers felt snubbed when the NCAA<br />\nselection committee failed to invite them<br />\nto a post-season bowl game.<br />\nFeeling that a lack of publicity and<br />\nweak opponents thwarted their chances<br />\nfor a bowl appearance in 1974, Towson<br />\nthis year added three new opponents and<br />\nsent out enough press releases and<br />\nbrochures to supply the U.S. Army with<br />\ntoilet paper for a year. Unfortunately the<br />\nTigers' hopes of an undefeated season and<br />\nbowl appearance were dashed as they<br />\ndropped two games in a row. Their<br />\nhype-job went for nought and succeeded<br />\nonly in creating emotionald and mental<br />\nproblems for the team.<br />\nSince their two losses at the beginning<br />\nof the season Towson has not had to<br />\nworry about the post-season and has been<br />\nable to concentrate on the regular season.<br />\nThe Tigers, with 33 lettermen returning,<br />\npossess a well-balanced attack and defense<br />\nwith no glaring deficiencies.<br />\nOffensively they are led by junior<br />\nquarterback Dan Dullea. A graduate of<br />\nLoyola High School, Dullea was one of the<br />\ntop passers in Division III last year. So far<br />\nthis season he has yet to match his super<br />\n974 performance though he has thrown 8<br /><br />\ntouchdown passes and represents a<br />\nconstant threat to open up a game.<br />\nThe Tiger offensive backfield, despite<br />\nthe loss of star Larry Jones to graduation,<br />\nis quite solid based primarily on the<br />\nrushing ofjunior tailback James Boyd.<br />\nDefensively, Towson is led by the<br />\noutstanding play of linebacker Jim<br />\nSandusky and defensive tackle Don<br />\nRedman.<br />\nTwo years ago, a highly touted and<br />\nover-confident Towson team traveled to<br />\nHopkins for what they thought would be<br />\nan easy victory. The Hopkins team went<br />\ninto the locker-room at halftime with a<br />\n22-0 lead and went on to win impressively<br />\n33-20.<br />\nLast year the Blue Jays were humiliated<br />\n44-0 and it seems Towson is expecting to<br />\nmeet with an accomodating Hopkins team<br />\nagain this year. Quarterback Dullea feels<br />\n\"It's easier to get up for other games than<br />\nthis one. The better the team, the easier it<br />\nis to get up for them. Not to be `Joe Cool'<br />\nor anything, I really don't get nervous at<br />\nall. I really believe I can turn it on right<br /><br />\nImmerim<br /><br />\nMINIPIN14.<br />\n,<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nejp\"<br /><br />\nbefore kickoff.\" Teammate -Jim<br />\nSanduskey added, \"We just hate<br />\nHopkins,\" with the rest of the team<br />\nechoing those sentiments.<br />\nMembers of the Blue Jay team feel that<br />\nTowson is \"ripe for the pluckin' \".<br />\nCertainly there is no love lost between the<br />\ntwo teams.<br />\nThe Jay with their revamped offense<br />\nwhich has consistently improved over the<br />\ncourse of the season, feel they can win. If<br />\nthe defense can put together a solid four<br />\nquarters it would make the job of the<br />\noffensive unit a great deal easier.<br />\nBlue Jay Coach Dennis Cox feels \"That<br />\nif we play as well defensively as we did<br />\nagainst Salisbury State and if our offense<br />\neliminates the mistakes and is consistent<br />\nthen we can be successful.\"<br />\n\"Last week we made too many mistakes<br />\nbut we showed a good deal of emotion<br />\nand excellent hitting. The hits were some<br />\nof the hardest I've ever seen for a Hopkins<br />\nteam.\" Coach Cox went on to say, \"The<br />\nteam should have no trouble getting up for<br />\nthis game\u2014it means too much.\"<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br />\nHISTORY OF SCI<br />\nUnder the auspices of the Center for History<br />\nand Philosophy of Science, Robert E.
