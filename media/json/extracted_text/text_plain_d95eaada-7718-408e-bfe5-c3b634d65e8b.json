A. C, crease last week-end, the<br />\nJay<br />\n<br />\nattackmen<br />\n<br />\ncould<br />\n<br />\nshoot 'em<br />\n<br />\nagainst the gymnasium wall and feel<br />\nslightly relieved. Since, however, the<br />\nMounts have neither a Reynolds nor<br />\na Phil Lotz, and are not quite as impregnable as the Maroons or the<br />\ngymnasium wall, the Jays figure to<br />\nbe somewhat more eloquent than they<br />\nwere against their first club foe.<br />\nToo much defense was the story<br />\nlast week. Chances for open shots<br />\nwere so infrequent that when they<br />\ndid come, Kelso Morrill's marksmen,<br />\nsort of surprised, couldn't find the<br />\nmark. Faulty marksmanship being<br />\neasily remedied, Jay followers can<br />\nlook forward to a pickup in this department, and since shots should be<br />\nmore frequent, perhaps, this week's<br />\nstory will have a happier ending.<br />\nBut while the Mounts don't measure up to the B.

In Lorne Guild, they have<br />\na deadly marksman who doesn't care<br />\nif he shoots one and makes one from<br />\nthe center of the field. And Stieber<br />\nand McDorman at the close attack<br />\nposts contribute handsomely to the<br />\ncharge.<br />\nMoreover, the clubmen are sure of<br />\nthemselves, pass sharply, use their<br />\nsticks like so many gloved hands, and<br />\nbreak towards the net swiftly behind<br />\neffective blocking.<br />\nThe Jay mentors have yet to see<br />\ntheir boys under fire, that is \"normal\"<br />\nfire.

C., they saw them battling<br />\nagainst what, in view of the Maroons'<br />\ndefense, may be called an impassable<br />\nflame.
