The quick succession of changes in political influences which we've<br />\nhad the fortune to observe<br />\nhave well succeeded in awing and appalling, or at least<br />\nconfusing, most.<br />\nA university affords no immunity. If anything, the<br />\natmosphere compels a cognizance of history's unfolding, and of the necessity for preparing to meet tomorrow's demands. The proposition becomes one of<br />\nswimming in the stream or being engulfed.<br />\nEmotion runs high today, and talk is cheap. And<br />\nthe more words flung, the harder it becomes to ferret<br />\nout the facts. Real thoughts and thinkers are at a premium, and consequently, distorted senses of values are<br />\nthe rule, rather than the exception.<br />\nThese problems face everybody\u2014we're all of us<br />\nalike to this extent. But a certain obligation devolves<br />\nupon us in particular because of our very youth. Supposedly, we're preparing ourselves to take our place<br />\nin this jumbled society\u2014but there's awfully little help.<br />\nHere the college newspaper must take its place as an<br />\nagency for the exposition of today's scarce facts.<br />\nThe college newspaper's job is in many respects<br />\nfar more complex than that of its brawnier counterpart, the metropolitan sheet. Existing as it does in the<br />\nmidst of an intimately associating community, and<br />\nforming an integral part of that close association, it<br />\nis confronted with a horde of problems unique to it.<br />\nTrue, circulation and advertising<br />\nThe college worries are reduced to a minimum<br />\npapers nicheor are non-existent. But more than<br />\ncounter-balancing this are the petty wranglings to be<br />\nmet; the injured feelings to be soothed; and the more<br />\nsubtle pressures to be withstood. These are hidden\u2014<br />\nand are consequently, dangerous threats.<br />\nSome six decades ago, men far wiser than we decided that naught short of Truth should suffice for the<br />\nHopkins. The axiom has worn well with time. And for<br />\nforty years the NEWS-LETTER has revered, abused, defied, and shouted that proposition. Though the pen<br />\nholding, guiding hands may change, the ideal remains<br />\nintact. We are dedicated to a purpose, and we dare<br />\nnot stray. The ideal is a lofty one\u2014the goal perhaps<br />\nbeyond us. We've just got to keep looking up to it.<br />\nThat then for better or worse, has made the NEWSLETTER what it is. And so far as we are concerned, it<br />\nshall continue to do so for at least one more year. We're<br />\nready and willing to undertake the obligations this<br />\nentails.<br />\nOur three or more pages of news columns must<br />\npresent an uncolored, complete, accurate, unbiased account of the day by day history of the Hopkins. Here<br />\nis no place for personal opinion or comment, and here<br />\nit shall not appear.<br />\nThree columns of our editorial page are allotted<br />\nthe campus as sounding board of opinion. Thus, as<br />\nofficial organ of the University's student body, we shall<br />\ncontinue to publish this body's thought and comment.<br />\nFinally, we reserve for ourselves two columns, our<br />\nown sanctum sanctorum, to be devoted to the ardent<br />\npursuit of the elusive Truth. To these two columns<br />\nwe limit our fights; here we praise or condemn; here<br />\nwe interpret our facts to the best of our ability and<br />\nmost honestly try to render our highest quality of service to Alma Mater.<br />\nBut in return, we must receive something: the con-<br />\n<br />\nThoughts on<br />\ntaking over<br />\na job<br />\n<br />\ntinuation and encouragement of free thought; the complete absence of censorship and restriction. It has been<br />\nluck to secure and retain this<br />\nNotes on the our<br />\nin the past\u2014during what we hope<br />\nfree press has been a minimum of abuse and<br />\na maximum of care.

To those of us<br />\nwho have known and worked with Murray, there were<br />\nweeks and years of fun and worry to be read between<br />\nthe lines.<br />\nThe boots he left to be filled would give Primo<br />\nCamera trouble. They're so big, we'll probably have to<br />\ntake several steps in them before they start moving.<br />\nHe had a tough job to do, and he did it well and without complaint.<br />\nThere isn't much that can be said. To the very large<br />\npart of the campus that is acquainted with him, all<br />\nthat is left unsaid about Murray will mean much more<br />\nthan that little we can say.<br />\nIt's been swell working with you, Murray. May<br />\nall your associations be as pleasant as all of ours have<br />\nbeen with you. Good-bye from the NEWS-LETTER, and<br />\na heartfelt good luck.<br />\n<br />\nFootnotes<br />\nof the<br />\nweek<br />\n<br />\nAny amount of experience along journalistic lines<br />\nimparts a certain terseness to one's written language.<br />\nA great deal of meaning is often crammed into a few<br />\nshort words.<br />\nA prime example of this came our way this last<br />\nweek, in the form of a note between the symbolic right<br />\nand left of the campus. We print it verbatim as an object lesson in journalism.<br />\n\"Dear Maxey,<br />\nI regret my inability to submit a column this week.<br />\nJ B Lawrence<br />\nP S. Do you?\"<br />\nWe're highly interested, from a purely curious point<br />\nof view, in the outcome of the poetry contest at present<br />\nunderway on the campus. Combined with some of the<br />\nbalmy weather we'd been having, it had put several<br />\nathletic gentlemen in such a highly-sensitized state of<br />\nmind that they were to be found in the grass of Wyman's park at all hours, absorbing vitamin D and<br />\noozing rhymes. We fear for their health. The ground is<br />\nstill damp.<br />\n<br />\nwatched the smoke, tranquilly philosophising on the usual theme of the<br />\nuselessness of it all; the smoke suddenly darted in one direction. The<br />\ndoor had opened; in walked a venerable-looking gentleman. He wasn't<br />\nexactly an admiral, but his uniform<br />\nwas proof that he was at least a petty<br />\nofficer in the service of our own<br />\nUncle Sam. His uniform was the conventional dark blue; but a generous<br />\nshare of self-satisfying gold braid<br />\nserved to brighten it up; his white<br />\nshirt was clean, his shoes shined.<br />\nAs bright as his gold braid, as<br />\nshiny as his mirror-like shoes, was<br />\nhis rather bulbous, berry-red nose<br />\nwhich immediately told us that he<br />\nwas a frequenter of many bright spots<br />\nlike Al's Grill. \"Scotch, straight\",<br />\nwas his gruff order. The sharp tone<br />\nof his voice immediately was proof<br />\nthat Uncle Sam had surely received<br />\nthe better part of his life and services;<br />\nIt must have been a long while since<br />\nhe had enlisted. But his back was<br />\nturned toward us as he conversed in<br />\nlow, indistinct monosyllables with the<br />\nbartender, and before we could learn<br />\nanymore about him, he had finished<br />\nhis eau-de-vie and quietly tottered<br />\nout of our lives.<br />\nAnother short reverie brought us<br />\nback to the realization that once<br />\nagain we were not alone. One of the<br />\nmore glamorous debutantes had deposited her somewhat portly person<br />\non one of the bar-stools. We never<br />\nhazard a guess at the age of any of<br />\nthe fair sex, so that had best be passed by. Her dark hat, augmented by<br />\na huge, gaudy feather, was set at a<br />\njaunty angle on her peroxide locks<br />\nand matched her dark jacket. She<br />\nwore a plaid shirt, bright red, green,<br />\nand black plaid; that skirt created<br />\nan impression. She ordered \"whiskey\" in a husky, tired voice. Maybe<br />\nshe was a shopworn debutante.<br />\nThe nickellodion blared again. There<br />\nwas a shuffling and tapping nearby,<br />\nand there we saw a sailor, happily engaged in entertaing himself and<br />\neveryone else with a new version of<br />\nBill Robinson's step dance, minus<br />\nsteps.<br />\nPeople often talk about the bartenders who have served them, and<br />\nfrom these tales we have gleaned<br />\nthat bartenders are all more or less<br />\nthe products of one mould. They have<br />\ngreat constancy, jovial faces, portly<br />\nappearances, and above all dexterity<br />\nof fingers. However, we thought Al's<br />\nbarkeeper slightly out of the ordinary. True, he was jovial, portly,<br />\ndexterous and magnificently constant, but he possessed one more<br />\nattribute that put him in a class entirely by himself. He was a philosopher. It's very possible that all<br />\nbartenders are philosophers, but we<br />\nhaven't heard or discovered any evidence to support that theory. He<br />\nwas a fatalist, he said, and he had<br />\narrived at his philosophy after an extended career. If you had met as<br />\nmany people as Jeff had, Jeff went<br />\non, you could possibly believe anything else. He was positive that he<br />\nhad seen those people in their most<br />\nunaffected, uncontrolled<br />\nmoments.<br />\nHe was sure that they had only acted<br />\nthrough fate. It was only fate that<br />\nhad made him a bartender instead of<br />\na banker or a beautician. He was<br />\nenthusiastically embarking upon a<br />\nshort, hour-length story of how he<br />\nhad come to be a bartender, but we<br />\nthought that we had had enough of<br />\nthe relation between fate and bartenders so we wandered back to our<br />\nbooth, got the check and called a<br />\npleasant evening to a pleasant halt.<br />\n<br />\nNotes in passing ...<br />\nIt seems like the Southern pole of<br />\nthe axis is going to melt under Afri-<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter:<br />\nSir\u2014The burden of the addresses by<br />\nPresident Bowman and Dr Shotwell<br />\nat the University Commemoration<br />\nexercises was freedom and democracy. President Bowman, particularly, remarked that proposals<br />\nfor social benefit must have reference<br />\nto what can be done in the present.<br />\nFrom Dr Shotwelrs address I jotted<br />\ndown the following sentences, which<br />\nare substantially as he put them:<br />\n\"The fundamental spirit of Liberty<br />\nis magnanimty.\" \"Only the generous<br />\nare free in mind.\" \"Liberty is to be<br />\nconsidered in terms of obligation, not<br />\nof escape.\"<br />\nNow I wonder whether these are<br />\njust brave sentiments spoken from<br />\nour University platform, or whether<br />\nthey may be exemplified right now on<br />\nour campus? One means of putting<br />\nthem in practce would be by admitting to the University an entirely<br />\nqualified Negro studnt whose application already has been under consideration for ten months or so, and<br />\nadmitting other negroes after him.<br />\nHow can we have democracy in America, in Baltimore, in Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, if we do not give the fullest educational opportunity to all of<br />\nthe people?

So far Hopkins<br />\nhas won 6 out of 12 games.<br />\nIt seems that Hopkins has more<br />\nthan a fighting chance in three of<br />\nthese contests, the only game that<br />\nlooms as a real threat to the Hopkins<br />\nfive is Mt St Mary's college.<br />\nHopkins has taken on new spirit<br />\nwith each game and at times during<br />\nthe Swarthmore game last Saturday<br />\nnight gave evidence of latent talent,<br />\nwhich needs only a bit of confidence<br />\nin self and fellow team mates to really bring it out. The Blue Jays seem<br />\nto have caught the fire of fighting<br />\nfor the ball; they seem to have caught<br />\nthe spirit which was obviously lacking the first part of the season.<br />\nThere is one drawback that Hopkins faces, that is the absence of its<br />\nsharp-shooting captain, Norman Melvin. Melvin has hurt his toe very badly and this injury has forced him out<br />\nof play. He will probably be absent<br />\nfrom the first two games next week.<br />\nWagner, who is substituting for the<br />\ncrippled captain, took over the position and handled the job very well.<br />\nHe is a quick thinker, has good basketball sense, and a good eye.

In general the conservatives believe that<br />\ncouncil action should stem from the<br />\ncouncil alone, \u2022and that the vote of<br />\nof<br />\na constituency at the beginning<br />\nthe representative's term is enough<br />\nto give him a mandate throughout his<br />\nterm. On most discussion, Harold<br />\nRicards, council president; William<br />\nDay, Athletic board president; and<br />\nRobert Hoopes, junior representative,<br />\nfall into the conservative column. The<br />\nmoderates do not vote consistently<br />\neither with the conservatives or with<br />\nthe liberals; their decisions are based<br />\non debate in the council to a large extent, or on the current needs of the<br />\ncampus as they see them. Schad,<br />\nHandelsman, and Rydstom fall into<br />\nthis category, with Schad closer<br />\nto the conservatives. More student government and response to<br />\nstudent sentiment as expressed in<br />\npolls and petitions is the basis for liberal voting in the council. Berkley<br />\nSellman, senior class president; J<br />\nMurray Kempton, senior representative; Thomas McElhiney, sophomore<br />\nrepresentative; and Wilson Haines,<br />\nfreshman representative, generally<br />\nfall into the liberal column in council<br />\nvotes.<br />\nSo far, in informal discussion, the<br />\nliberals have favored revision of the<br />\nconstitution, the conservatives opposed. The moderates have more or<br />\nless favored revision with some limittations. The final vote will probably<br />\nbe based on the conservative-moderate-liberal division of the council as<br />\nevidenced by past votes. What effect<br />\nthe poll, on four of the proposals held<br />\nlast week by the NEWS-LETTER Will<br />\nhave on the Student council is difficult to guess this time since the poll<br />\nresults have not been discussed in a<br />\n<br />\ncommittee<br />\nThe Freshman commission meeting in the Sherwood room of Levering hall last Tuesday evening, elected<br />\nits executive council of seven members for the second team.

The axiom has worn well with time. And for<br />\nforty years the NEWS-LETTER has revered, abused, defied, and shouted that proposition. Though the pen<br />\nholding, guiding hands may change, the ideal remains<br />\nintact. We are dedicated to a purpose, and we dare<br />\nnot stray. The ideal is a lofty one\u2014the goal perhaps<br />\nbeyond us. We've just got to keep looking up to it.<br />\nThat then for better or worse, has made the NEWSLETTER what it is. And so far as we are concerned, it<br />\nshall continue to do so for at least one more year. We're<br />\nready and willing to undertake the obligations this<br />\nentails.<br />\nOur three or more pages of news columns must<br />\npresent an uncolored, complete, accurate, unbiased account of the day by day history of the Hopkins. Here<br />\nis no place for personal opinion or comment, and here<br />\nit shall not appear.<br />\nThree columns of our editorial page are allotted<br />\nthe campus as sounding board of opinion. Thus, as<br />\nofficial organ of the University's student body, we shall<br />\ncontinue to publish this body's thought and comment.<br />\nFinally, we reserve for ourselves two columns, our<br />\nown sanctum sanctorum, to be devoted to the ardent<br />\npursuit of the elusive Truth. To these two columns<br />\nwe limit our fights; here we praise or condemn; here<br />\nwe interpret our facts to the best of our ability and<br />\nmost honestly try to render our highest quality of service to Alma Mater.<br />\nBut in return, we must receive something: the con-<br /><br />\nThoughts on<br />\ntaking over<br />\na job<br /><br />\ntinuation and encouragement of free thought; the complete absence of censorship and restriction. It has been<br />\nluck to secure and retain this<br />\nNotes on the our<br />\nin the past\u2014during what we hope<br />\nfree press has been a minimum of abuse and<br />\na maximum of care. May this continue. To have it<br />\notherwise is wrong by every precept of education or<br />\nnatural right.<br /><br />\nPotpourri Mitchell asks<br />\nby Clio University to<br />\nNews-Letter Night Life ...<br />\nIt is seldom that a would-be scholar, like your columnist takes time, in<br /><br />\nDead<br /><br />\nend?<br /><br />\nMurray Kempton checked<br />\nout of the litter that is the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER Office last<br />\nweek, with a sentimental<br />\ngood-bye to his readers that<br />\nwas gripping in its genuine<br />\nsincerity. To those of us<br />\nwho have known and worked with Murray, there were<br />\nweeks and years of fun and worry to be read between<br />\nthe lines.<br />\nThe boots he left to be filled would give Primo<br />\nCamera trouble. They're so big, we'll probably have to<br />\ntake several steps in them before they start moving.<br />\nHe had a tough job to do, and he did it well and without complaint.<br />\nThere isn't much that can be said. To the very large<br />\npart of the campus that is acquainted with him, all<br />\nthat is left unsaid about Murray will mean much more<br />\nthan that little we can say.<br />\nIt's been swell working with you, Murray. May<br />\nall your associations be as pleasant as all of ours have<br />\nbeen with you. Good-bye from the NEWS-LETTER, and<br />\na heartfelt good luck.<br /><br />\nFootnotes<br />\nof the<br />\nweek<br /><br />\nAny amount of experience along journalistic lines<br />\nimparts a certain terseness to one's written language.<br />\nA great deal of meaning is often crammed into a few<br />\nshort words.<br />\nA prime example of this came our way this last<br />\nweek, in the form of a note between the symbolic right<br />\nand left of the campus. We print it verbatim as an object lesson in journalism.<br />\n\"Dear Maxey,<br />\nI regret my inability to submit a column this week.<br />\nJ B Lawrence<br />\nP S. Do you?\"<br />\nWe're highly interested, from a purely curious point<br />\nof view, in the outcome of the poetry contest at present<br />\nunderway on the campus. Combined with some of the<br />\nbalmy weather we'd been having, it had put several<br />\nathletic gentlemen in such a highly-sensitized state of<br />\nmind that they were to be found in the grass of Wyman's park at all hours, absorbing vitamin D and<br />\noozing rhymes. We fear for their health. The ground is<br />\nstill damp.<br /><br />\nwatched the smoke, tranquilly philosophising on the usual theme of the<br />\nuselessness of it all; the smoke suddenly darted in one direction. The<br />\ndoor had opened; in walked a venerable-looking gentleman. He wasn't<br />\nexactly an admiral, but his uniform<br />\nwas proof that he was at least a petty<br />\nofficer in the service of our own<br />\nUncle Sam. His uniform was the conventional dark blue; but a generous<br />\nshare of self-satisfying gold braid<br />\nserved to brighten it up; his white<br />\nshirt was clean, his shoes shined.<br />\nAs bright as his gold braid, as<br />\nshiny as his mirror-like shoes, was<br />\nhis rather bulbous, berry-red nose<br />\nwhich immediately told us that he<br />\nwas a frequenter of many bright spots<br />\nlike Al's Grill. \"Scotch, straight\",<br />\nwas his gruff order. The sharp tone<br />\nof his voice immediately was proof<br />\nthat Uncle Sam had surely received<br />\nthe better part of his life and services;<br />\nIt must have been a long while since<br />\nhe had enlisted. But his back was<br />\nturned toward us as he conversed in<br />\nlow, indistinct monosyllables with the<br />\nbartender, and before we could learn<br />\nanymore about him, he had finished<br />\nhis eau-de-vie and quietly tottered<br />\nout of our lives.<br />\nAnother short reverie brought us<br />\nback to the realization that once<br />\nagain we were not alone. One of the<br />\nmore glamorous debutantes had deposited her somewhat portly person<br />\non one of the bar-stools. We never<br />\nhazard a guess at the age of any of<br />\nthe fair sex, so that had best be passed by. Her dark hat, augmented by<br />\na huge, gaudy feather, was set at a<br />\njaunty angle on her peroxide locks<br />\nand matched her dark jacket. She<br />\nwore a plaid shirt, bright red, green,<br />\nand black plaid; that skirt created<br />\nan impression. She ordered \"whiskey\" in a husky, tired voice. Maybe<br />\nshe was a shopworn debutante.<br />\nThe nickellodion blared again. There<br />\nwas a shuffling and tapping nearby,<br />\nand there we saw a sailor, happily engaged in entertaing himself and<br />\neveryone else with a new version of<br />\nBill Robinson's step dance, minus<br />\nsteps.<br />\nPeople often talk about the bartenders who have served them, and<br />\nfrom these tales we have gleaned<br />\nthat bartenders are all more or less<br />\nthe products of one mould. They have<br />\ngreat constancy, jovial faces, portly<br />\nappearances, and above all dexterity<br />\nof fingers. However, we thought Al's<br />\nbarkeeper slightly out of the ordinary. True, he was jovial, portly,<br />\ndexterous and magnificently constant, but he possessed one more<br />\nattribute that put him in a class entirely by himself. He was a philosopher. It's very possible that all<br />\nbartenders are philosophers, but we<br />\nhaven't heard or discovered any evidence to support that theory. He<br />\nwas a fatalist, he said, and he had<br />\narrived at his philosophy after an extended career. If you had met as<br />\nmany people as Jeff had, Jeff went<br />\non, you could possibly believe anything else. He was positive that he<br />\nhad seen those people in their most<br />\nunaffected, uncontrolled<br />\nmoments.<br />\nHe was sure that they had only acted<br />\nthrough fate. It was only fate that<br />\nhad made him a bartender instead of<br />\na banker or a beautician. He was<br />\nenthusiastically embarking upon a<br />\nshort, hour-length story of how he<br />\nhad come to be a bartender, but we<br />\nthought that we had had enough of<br />\nthe relation between fate and bartenders so we wandered back to our<br />\nbooth, got the check and called a<br />\npleasant evening to a pleasant halt.<br /><br />\nNotes in passing ...<br />\nIt seems like the Southern pole of<br />\nthe axis is going to melt under Afri-<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter:<br />\nSir\u2014The burden of the addresses by<br />\nPresident Bowman and Dr Shotwell<br />\nat the University Commemoration<br />\nexercises was freedom and democracy. President Bowman, particularly, remarked that proposals<br />\nfor social benefit must have reference<br />\nto what can be done in the present.<br />\nFrom Dr Shotwelrs address I jotted<br />\ndown the following sentences, which<br />\nare substantially as he put them:<br />\n\"The fundamental spirit of Liberty<br />\nis magnanimty.\" \"Only the generous<br />\nare free in mind.\" \"Liberty is to be<br />\nconsidered in terms of obligation, not<br />\nof escape.\"<br />\nNow I wonder whether these are<br />\njust brave sentiments spoken from<br />\nour University platform, or whether<br />\nthey may be exemplified right now on<br />\nour campus? One means of putting<br />\nthem in practce would be by admitting to the University an entirely<br />\nqualified Negro studnt whose application already has been under consideration for ten months or so, and<br />\nadmitting other negroes after him.<br />\nHow can we have democracy in America, in Baltimore, in Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, if we do not give the fullest educational opportunity to all of<br />\nthe people?

What are Hopkins<br />\ncomplete set of wins? So far Hopkins<br />\nhas won 6 out of 12 games.<br />\nIt seems that Hopkins has more<br />\nthan a fighting chance in three of<br />\nthese contests, the only game that<br />\nlooms as a real threat to the Hopkins<br />\nfive is Mt St Mary's college.<br />\nHopkins has taken on new spirit<br />\nwith each game and at times during<br />\nthe Swarthmore game last Saturday<br />\nnight gave evidence of latent talent,<br />\nwhich needs only a bit of confidence<br />\nin self and fellow team mates to really bring it out. The Blue Jays seem<br />\nto have caught the fire of fighting<br />\nfor the ball; they seem to have caught<br />\nthe spirit which was obviously lacking the first part of the season.<br />\nThere is one drawback that Hopkins faces, that is the absence of its<br />\nsharp-shooting captain, Norman Melvin. Melvin has hurt his toe very badly and this injury has forced him out<br />\nof play. He will probably be absent<br />\nfrom the first two games next week.<br />\nWagner, who is substituting for the<br />\ncrippled captain, took over the position and handled the job very well.<br />\nHe is a quick thinker, has good basketball sense, and a good eye. He<br />\nseemed to fit right in with the organization of the team.<br />\nWhat chance has HoPkins against<br />\nWestern Maryland? It would be better put, what chance has Western<br />\nMaryland against Hopkins? For in<br />\nthe previous contest with the Western Maryland five, Hopkins was an<br />\neasy victor by the score of 35 to 24.<br />\nIn this early season game the Blue<br />\nquint showed its obvious dominance<br />\nin play; yet Western Maryland has<br />\nseveral freshmen on its squad who<br />\nneeded several games under their belts<br />\nbefore they could feel right in intercollegiate play, and now that they<br />\nhave had time to digest a couple of<br />\ngood basketball meals they might be<br />\nrarin' to make Hopkins basketball<br />\nteam their juicy dessert.

In general the conservatives believe that<br />\ncouncil action should stem from the<br />\ncouncil alone, \u2022and that the vote of<br />\nof<br />\na constituency at the beginning<br />\nthe representative's term is enough<br />\nto give him a mandate throughout his<br />\nterm. On most discussion, Harold<br />\nRicards, council president; William<br />\nDay, Athletic board president; and<br />\nRobert Hoopes, junior representative,<br />\nfall into the conservative column. The<br />\nmoderates do not vote consistently<br />\neither with the conservatives or with<br />\nthe liberals; their decisions are based<br />\non debate in the council to a large extent, or on the current needs of the<br />\ncampus as they see them. Schad,<br />\nHandelsman, and Rydstom fall into<br />\nthis category, with Schad closer<br />\nto the conservatives. More student government and response to<br />\nstudent sentiment as expressed in<br />\npolls and petitions is the basis for liberal voting in the council. Berkley<br />\nSellman, senior class president; J<br />\nMurray Kempton, senior representative; Thomas McElhiney, sophomore<br />\nrepresentative; and Wilson Haines,<br />\nfreshman representative, generally<br />\nfall into the liberal column in council<br />\nvotes.<br />\nSo far, in informal discussion, the<br />\nliberals have favored revision of the<br />\nconstitution, the conservatives opposed. The moderates have more or<br />\nless favored revision with some limittations. The final vote will probably<br />\nbe based on the conservative-moderate-liberal division of the council as<br />\nevidenced by past votes.
